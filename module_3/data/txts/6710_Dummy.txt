Aish, there's not one picture that
came out well.
Just what did I take a picture of?
Oh, it's Min Ji.

<i>The incident that changed
our lives for the next six months</i>
<i>started with this accident.</i>
It arrived!
She's pretty.
Hello!
- Hey Mr Goo Dong Baek!
- Yes?
Take this motorcycle up to the
1st floor please.
Yes, I will.
I'll count on you, then.
- Ah, what is this?!
- Ah, I'm so sorry.
I am really sorry.
Oh what do I do?
Is everything alright?
Shall I bring you a wet towel?
{\a6}You should have sat down and drank wine!
- Ah I'm so annoyed.
- I'm sorry.
Now what are you going to do
about this?!
I said, what are you going to do?
It's not even going to come out!
Ji Soo...
It's Han Ji Soo!
<i>What seems to be the problem?</i>
Ah, yes. Excuse me, but...
I'm Goo Dong Baek from the Business Team.
R-Right now, the motorcycle carrying
elevator seems to be stuck,
what should happen now?
<i>Ah, that elevator's broken again...</i>
<i>It will take 2-3 hours to fix</i>
<i>It might be very stuffy but, please
be patient and wait.</i>
Oh is that how it is?
Yes, I understand.
Thank you for your efforts to...
Although you can't wear it,
please keep it as a memory.
Oh, Thank you! Thank you!
I didn't even bring my cell phone.
Oh, the Team Manager will yell at me,
what am I going to do now?
2-3 hours...?
Aigoo.
Brace the corner!
He's bracing for the corner
and he's in first place!!
*Singing Korea's national anthem*
Han Ji Soo.
Han Ji Soo?
It is the actress Han Ji Soo?
Has the dress come yet?
Yeah, the one that's coming from Milan...
What?!
It still hasn't arrived yet?!
Wow, it's the 911 squad!
I salute you! You must have
so many call-outs!
They even called you guys
just so you can save me?
Will you pull me through the top?
Opened already?
Ah Mr Goo Dong Baek...
- Please hand over the blue box in the bag.
- Pardon?
The blue box!
That's the one, right?
You know the actress Han Ji Soo, right?
It's the dress she's wearing at
tomorrow's Film Awards.
Oh, so that's why you wanted the
door opened so badly.
This is it.
Excuse Me.
What about me?
Oh my goodness!
Unni, this is like a piece of art!
Ji Soo unni will definitely be
the best tomorrow.
It is pretty but does this match with
Ji Soo's movie concept?
It should show a little
more of an intellectual image.
Then should actors in ghost movies
wear white undergarments?
Unni, you should just fire me.
You already picked out your dress
and everything.
I'm a stylist in name only.
I've got nothing to do.
What is it?
Hi, Ji Soo.
To receive such a present
like this beforehand
what happens if I don't receive
an award tomorrow?
Then, you have to return it.
But I don't want to return it.
Now, I'll really have to win
the award tomorrow.
That's for Good Luck.
Let's spend tomorrow together.
Yes. See you tomorrow.
- Min Ji, let’s eat dinner...
- AHHHHHHHHHH!
At least make a sound whenever you
come in!  You scared me!
Hey, I always come home at this hour.
Are you bragging about being on time?
Don't you have anyone to play with?
I prefer playing with my dongsaeng.
Just save it!
You're the reason I can't date
Do you think I'd want to play with
you at this age?
I have to get married too!
Then, go ahead.
You know I can't get married
until after you do.
Ahh, you're bringing that up again?
You don't even have a partner!
Ah, don't relieve your stress with
exercise, go meet a woman!
Really!!
Here, take this.
What is it?
Tomorrow's your birthday.
Glasses?
My sight is good...
I am 20/20.
They're fashion glasses.
You arent that handsome,
so you need help you stand out.
No one notices or remembers you
SO much better!
You have to have a point in your image,
- They're bothersome...
- Ah, don't you dare take them off.
and,
ta da!
Aw, you didn't have to give me two...
Film Awards?!
Go with the prettiest girl in your work place!
- You have a girl that you like, right?
- Huh?
A girl that I like?..
Ah! Looks like you have one!
So give your face a focal point?
I like it!
Oh, you became even faster!
You can't even see your hands!
Can't even see your hands!
- HEY GOO DONG BAEK!
- Oh, you scared me.
Oh, hello Team Manager!
Good morning!
How come you're always sorting out
mail every morning?
WANT ME TO CHANGE YOUR POSITION?!
No, no. I really like the Business Team.
They just asked for help...
Oh, by the way,
do you notice something different
about me today Team Manager?
What seems to be different?
Uh, the top portion
Something really drastic...
I'm wearing glasses!!
Didn't you always wear glasses?
Today's the first time I've worn them!
Did you?
What? What... do they not make a point?
Oh, it's Ms Kyung Ae!
To Ms Kyung Ae.
I have two tickets to the Film Awards...
Would you like to go together?
So dust doesn't get in it, stick it on.
Looking forward to your beautiful smile.
- Let's have dinner tonight!
- Ms Kyung Ae, FIGHTING!
{\a6}For an active life - AJA!
- It was love at first sight...
- Would you spend some time...
Man, why are there so many?
Mr Goo Dong Baek!
Yes?
Idiot!
Ah! What's wrong?
Why can't you say it?!
Say what?
If you like me, say that you like me!
Why can't you say that?
Ms Kyung Ae! H-How did you know?
How much longer do I have to wait for you?
...W-Wait?
It's hard to keep this all in my heart...
Yes?
...and it's so difficult!
I'm so sorry.
Say it!
How much longer do I have to wait...
have to wait...
Ah, I'm always getting stuck on this!
How.much.longer.do.I.have.to.wait.for.you.
Have to wait for you!
I haven't won the election yet,
this is just the primary vote candidacy.
Didn't we open the champagne a
little too early?
Congratulations, Father.
Ah well...
Your merits are greater.
Mister, please say something.
There is only 6 months left.
Until we win the Seoul City election,
please keep up the good work.
Here.
To candidate Kim Jung Wook, cheers!
Cheers!
Ji Soo Unni!
Ji Soo Unni!
Ah you're just so pretty!!
Unni, please look in this
direction just once!
Who? Who?
Ji Soo Unni!!
- Han-Han Ji Soo?
- You're so pretty.
Han Ji Soo!
Hello.
Kang Mo is presenting the
Best Actress Award.
I really would like it if Ms Han Ji Soo
received that award.
Thank you.
Let's go.
Mr Kang Mo...
Yes?
I probably have to go my aunt's art gallery
after the Awards show.
let's go together.
Today's the last day of the exhibit,
so we should show our support.
I have a appointment, I'm sorry.
My father will be coming.
Is it an important appointment?
Yes.
I'm sorry, Ji Soo.
The engagement...
I think I have to go through with it.
If things work out as planned,
I'll come right back to you, Ji Soo.
Although it may be hard,
trust me and wait just for a little while.
I'll come back to you for sure, Ji Soo.
He's only here because it's a
formal public event.
That's the reason he did it.
I'm okay.
Thank you.
Hello.
Hello, Reporter Baek.
It seems that your father is
in the #1 spot.
Congratulations.
It's because you help him alot.
There must be 6 months left to win.
Kim and the others might feel
very pressured.
You'll be in an awkward position if
another candidate wins.
Can there be such a situation?
Ah, but...
how come a political journalist is at
an Awards show?
There's something I wanted to verify.
Well then, I'll leave you to it.
Yes, Sir.
If he hasn't come home then he's
probably already there.
<i>Kim Kang Mo will be the announcer of
the Best Actress Award.</i>
Since when did they put business men
in such a job?
Ah, but he is good looking.
I will announce the winner of this year's
Best Actress Award.
Han Ji Soo! You have to give it
to Han Ji Soo!
The winner is...
Actress Han Ji Soo!!
That's right! There's no one
but Han Ji Soo!
Thank you.
<i>Han Ji Soo, your acceptance speech please.</i>
Thank you.
"Since you won this award last year,
It would be difficult to win it again",
that's what everyone has been telling me,
at that time, I just laughed...
but honestly, I wanted to beat them up.
What one does for love,
is not sacrifice, it's happiness.
I'm very glad that so many people
thought I deserved it
and, I'm very thankful to all
the staff members.
Han Ji Soo's necklace is to die for.
Thank you.
HUH?! It's Oppa!
Ji Soo Jjang! Ji Soo Jjang!
But what is that!?
He's sitting alone in an area surrounded
by young teenagers!
I feel like I'm going to explode, seriously!
Just wait 'till he comes home...
Congratulations, Ji Soo!
Let's exclude the Manager,
and have Han Ji Soo and Kim Kang Mo
sit in the car together.
Let's have at least one piece of evidence.
Hey, what is this?
Oh, that's right!
That's right, this is it!
Now.. I don't have to return this!
What a relief.
Right?
Let's go eat something delicious.
Next time.
Kang Mo, go to the exhibit.
Hmm?
What's wrong?
Is there someone following us?!
It seems like it's Reporter Baek.
So you're planning to run...
Alright, let's do this.
Aish, there's not one picture that
came out well.
Just what did I take a picture of?
Oh, it's Min Ji.
Hi, Min Ji!
Oh no, what do we do?!
Please. Please!!
We can't do this.
Kang Mo, get out of the car!
Phew, I thought I was going to die.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Are you alright?
Please help. Hurry!
Y-Yes?
Everything will be over.
Kim Kang Mo!
What are you?
Who the heck are you?!
My name is Goo Dong Baek.
Han Ji Soo!
Where did Kim Kang Mo go?
What do you mean?
Han Ji Soo?
Oh my!!!!
What are you?
Where did you get involved?!
Reporter Baek.
It seems like my shoulder has been injured,
won't you call an ambulance for me?
You know that Ji Soo doesn't
have a license.
Do you think she's the type to
ask a stranger?
It's Kang Mo.
It's me.
Is your body okay?
Mm, they said there's nothing wrong.
That's a relief.
So what does that person do?
He works for the Post Office.
I arranged it so he was the one driving.
He's my fan and said that he would help,
so don't worry, Kang Mo.
Because you may never know, tell him
the story straight.
Give him everything he asks for,
because it doesn't matter how much.
All right.
I'll take care of it.
Where are you?
On my way to the exhibit,
to secure my alibi.
All right. That's good.
Then, I'll hang up.
You said you've received his business card.
Oh..
Central Post Office...
Business Finance Team.
Goo Dong Baek?
What kind of situation is this?
How could Han Ji Soo
and I?... really!
Ah, certainly.
Do you have a business card?
Business card? Yes.
Here.
I'm Goo Dong Baek.
- You work at a Post Office?
- Yes.
That car... wasn't driven by you
from the start, right?
Really... reporters...
Han Ji Soo explained everything before.
Explained what?
That you're Han Ji Soo's fan,
and the two of you met at the Awards show?
Yes.
And because Han Ji Soo doesn't have
a license, you drove for her?
Yes. That's exactly right!
Do you know the man who was with Han Ji Soo?
He's the son of Seoul's mayoral candidate.
It's best if you come clean and
don't get involved.
That is, if you don't want to get hurt!
But we explained the truth to you.
Do you think this is a joke?!
- Mr Goo Dong Baek!
- Yes.
The Doctor is looking for you.
Oh, the Doctor is looking for me?
The Doctor is looking for me,
well then...
I won't just let this pass!
We're very thankful for you today.
Ah, certainly.
I'd like to request one more time that
you drove from the very start today.
You don't have to worry about that.
Also, you must keep this a secret from
your family, Mr Goo Dong Baek.
This is a request!
Oh, of course.
Ms Han Ji Soo cannot be burdened
because of me, never!
And so... that is why we'd like to
give you a reward.
- A reward?
- Please tell me whatever you'd like.
We'll prepare it right away.
You don't have to do that.
Ah, we're the ones that caused such a problem,
it's something we should at least do.
Please tell me.
Oh.. I haven't thought about it yet...
Then...
if it's not too difficult,
may I ask for several*?
(*implies monetary bills)
Ah... certainly.
How many?
Eight.
No, nine.
Nine?!
Eight...
Nine.
That's the last one.
And your arm must be hurting
from the accident.
Thank you so much. Thank you.
Now, please tell us your real request.
Ah, that really isn't it.
This is all, really.
Then, we'll be the ones that'll prepare
something for you.
Why must you do this, Manager?
I didn't help because of the money.
I've got all these autographs,
that really is enough.
I'm not just giving it to you.
I'm asking you to take responsibility
for our secret.
I'm giving it to you to tell you
that no matter what the circumstances,
I want you to keep our secret.
I'll keep your secret.
I'll take responsibility for sure.
I'll take today's incident to my grave...
even If I don't receive any money.
To be honest,
I'm your biggest fan.
To be with you like this...
I'm not sure if a person like you,
Ms Han Ji Soo, would remember me, but
because of the secret that
only you and I hold,
I'll remember you, Ms Han Ji Soo, forever!
Actually, today was my birthday.
I-I really think that I've
received a good gift.
Thank you!!
He's truly a rare person.
If it were any other male, they'd probably
like to receive a lot more.
Nine autographs?
I don't know whether he's a good person...
or just a naive person that doesn't
know much about the world.
What's  this?
Does this mean he's stalking you?
<i>Originally I wanted to make you happy,</i>
<i>but instead I made things difficult.</i>
<i>You suffered a lot today.</i>
Unni,
No matter what, my heart can't just let it go.
Will that be OK if you meet that person
one more time tomorrow?
Hey! You saw him with me.
He won't take anything.
It may be the fact I was there and
he didn't want to be rejected.
Please do this... yes?
Goo Dong Baek!
You really!!...
What is wrong with you today?!
Do you even know how I got those tickets?!
One ticket cost 50,000 Won
but I barely got them by giving
my friend 100,000 Won!
- 100,000 Won?
- What on earth is wrong with you?!
I put a valuable object in your hand for you
and you can't even go on one date?!
What are you going to do?
Do you want to die not having dated
at least once in your life?!
What do you mean ‘why can't I date'?
If Oppa puts effort into it, I can!
And do exactly what?
You went by yourself!
But...
how did you know that I went to
the Award show alone?
How, huh?
I saw you sitting right next to female
high school students diligently clapping
with... with... who is that?
When that person received her award!!
Han Ji Soo isn't a “that”, you don't
even know her.
Then, did you ever get to see her up close?
I've seen her!
I have!
- What is that?
- Proof that I saw her up close!
- It's Han Ji Soo's genuine signature!
- What?!
Here.
You met her at the Award show?!
- You really met her?!
- Shh!... Let's stop there.
Ah, Oppa! Tell me!
- You really met her?!
- Shhh!
Let's stop there.
What is this?
He just received an autograph
and yet he's acting like a pompous jerk.
One for Team Leader Oh...
Another for Team Leader Ko...
And for his son...
For Ms Kyung Ae... For Ms Myung Jin...
For Yoon Sup and Tae Hwan...
and this one for me.
This is one came out darkest and the best.
Alright... Let's sleep!
How could something like this happen to me?
So pretty...
How could someone be that pretty?
The guy who's dating Han Ji Soo...
sure hit the jackpot.
Good Morning!
Team Manager!
Do you know what is in this bag?!
I brought signatures!
- Signatures?
- Yes!
Goo Dong Baek, you mean you really
got signatures?!
I got several!
Several!?
Oh! Oh! You cute little rascal!
This is how you're supposed to work!
I knew it from the first time I saw you
that you had potential.
So how many did you get?
How large is the contract?
What kind of person signed for you?
You know the famous actress
Ms Han Ji Soo, right?
Of course I know her.
It's Han Ji Soo's signature!
Wait, so you didn't get the signature from
selling an insurance policy...
but an actress' autograph?
Aish starting at such an early morning
I heard that your son is a huge fan
of Ms Han Ji Soo
so you get two, Sir!
Here you go!
Give it all to me.
No, you can't!
I have to give it to everyone...
{\a6}- GIVE IT TO ME!!!
- No!!!
Boss, what are you doing right now?!
You're starting foolish nonsense from the
start of the morning!!
How many insurance policies have
you sold so far?
How many do you think you've sold?!
Should I teach you?
Zero.Zero.Zero.ZERO!
Next door's Team Leader sold so many
bargains during Easter
that they decided to go to Okinawa
so they would pack speedos and trunks
and are so excited
but what does that make me?!
You make me feel like a victim! Why is that?
What were you going to give us?
He probably wanted to give you
Ms Han Ji Soo's autograph.
Ms Han Ji Soo's autograph?
How did you get that?
What do you mean ‘how did you get that'?
How do you think he got it?!
He probably forged it to look
like Han Ji Soo's.
What's so special about him that he's
able to get her autograph?
Oh Team Manager!
This is really Ms Han Ji Soo's signature!
HEY! GOO DONG BAEK,
why are you acting like this?!
If you have enough time to get autographs,
you should be able to sell at least one policy
look for other work or don't do it at all!!
It's real though.
I wanted to see actual results...
but with all this excitement from
the morning..
Ah, my temper's just rising!
Oh... I shouldn't say a word...
shouldn't say a word...
To think I wanted you to come
with me to Okinawa?
Okinawa? Really...
All I can say is swear words.
Could you move?
That's right...
Of course, there's no one else
to go besides you.
Aish...
He doesn't even know what happened to me...
Oh, it's ripped.
Alright, alright!
Let's go get a cup of coffee.
To think I was going to get
something delicious.
Let's just go.
Oh!
It looks like people don't believe that
you got Ji Soo's autograph.
I know, right?
No one believes me.
It's not easy to get
Ms Han Ji Soo's autograph,
so it was amazing when she
gave me 9 copies.
If I was in that position,
I would've done it too.
Even if people do that to you,
Mr Goo Dong Baek,
don't you get angry?
Of course I get angry.  I do get angry.
But what can I do if they don't believe me?
That doesn't matter.
To believe or not to believe....
I met Ms Han Ji Soo in person so
that's all there is to it.
Ah, but what's the reason you came
to the Post Office?
Uh, that is...
What seems to be the problem?
If there's anything I can do, I can
prepare it in a hurry.
To be honest...
Yes?
This.
Ah, you want to send a
special delivery?
Oh... but you haven't written
the address yet.
Uh, we thought about this a lot
and we concluded that not receiving
a reward would be a little...
It's your reward.
You too, Manager cannot seem to believe me.
- No, no. It's nothing like that..
- People..
I don't get why people can't
believe other people...
- Mr Goo Dong Baek..
- I'm keeping my promise.
I will firmly keep that promise.
So even if it's not you, Manager,
please believe me.
No, I...
Ok... Please get ready for the next shoot.
- So did it get solved properly?
- No!
I feel so embarrassed, irritated. Sorry.
If I lived in a little cave, I'd want to
crawl right into it!!
He said he won't ever receive it.
He said to trust him.
Is that so? I understand.
Let's just tell Kang Mo that we've solved
the problem with money.
Ah, but you know the autographs you
signed for Mr Goo Dong Baek?
Yeah. Why?
He gave it out to the postmen but
it seems like they harassed him about it
being fake and mocked him.
Unni.. Please come see the next shoot.
Ok!
- Get ready.
- Yeah
<i>I'm not sure if a person like you,
Ms Han Ji Soo, would remember me, but</i>
<i>because of the secret that
only you and I hold,</i>
<i>I'll remember you, Ms Han Ji Soo, forever!</i>
<i>Actually, today was my birthday.</i>
It's Han Ji Soo!!
Oh! It's Han Ji Soo!!
Oh! It's Han Ji Soo!
Hello!
Yes, can I help you...
I have to see Mr Goo Dong Baek
right away...
Mr Goo Dong Baek, where is he right now?
Excuse me?  Mr Goo Dong Baek?
ME! ME! ME!
I'm the one!
I'm the one, who is in charge
of his division!
Oh, is that so?
Yes!
Ah, please come this way! It's this way.
But... You really are Ms Han Ji Soo, right?
Yes.
Hello. You're all working very hard.
Hey, what is this?!
Does this mean that the signatures
were actually real?
Impossible. Why Han Ji Soo?
Isn't she just a Han Ji Soo lookalike?!
Hey, hey. Let's go.
Now he'll come out.
Mr Goo Dong Baek!
Goo Dong... Just l-look at who just arrived?!
Hello, have you been well?
Oh, yes.
No...
Han Ji Soo.. how did you...
Yesterday was your birthday so I came
here to greet you.
I know it's late, but Happy Birthday.
Mr Goo Dong Baek, what are you doing?
Hurry up and take it!
Hurry up! She's going to strain her arm!
Oh yes, yes.
- Congratulations!
- Oh yes. Yes.
Wow, all this?
How come there's so many things?
T-This is a suit case.
It's designer brand!
Ah, move! Move!
Ow!
Just who are you saying to move?!
You rascals, can't even tell the difference
between feces and red bean paste.
Ah but I'm not calling you,
Ms Han Ji Soo, red bean paste
AHH! And DEFINITELY NOT F-F-FECES!
Oh gosh, really!
What am I saying?
Oh-Oh why do my words come out like this?
Oh, but...
how do you know Mr Dong Baek?
Mr Goo Dong Baek is a fan of mine whom I
think is very special...
and sometimes chauffeurs for me.
Isn't that right?
Yes, yes, yes.
D-Drive?!
Even driving?!
Oh my goodness, since when?!
I also thought that because it's
Mr Goo Dong Baek's birthday I'd pay for lunch.
Would you like to come with us?
Lunch... together?
Yes.
But...
it's an hour before noon, I don't
think we can.
Ah... well there seems to be a Crab
cooking restaurant nearby.
I'll make reservations so please come
when it's lunch time.
Mr Goo Dong Baek is the only one
that's going to go!
Stop dreaming! Crab meat is so expensive...
it'll be burdensome, so you can't all go!
A Postman?
Kim Kang Mo...
please get caught at least in one frame...
Aish...
Huh?
So this is... Kim Kang Mo in the shadows?
Mr Kim Kang Mo first debuted
Ms Han Ji Soo.
They were dating each other.
Even though Kim Kang Mo is now engaged,
they continue to secretly see each other.
If Kim Kang Mo's future father-in-law
finds out about this...
the outcome is obvious.
But...
What bothers me is that you can't see
his face in the picture.
The person that claims he drove...
can we get him to talk?
It seems like they have made him a deal...
but I'll go and visit him one more time.
I can't afford to lose to another reporter.
The President will probably like this.
What the hell do you think you're doing?!
You arrived late to the art exhibit...
because you were with that girl,
and you get caught in photographs?!
How long are you going to keep
seeing that girl?!
You said you'd leave the Ji Soo matter alone,
as long as I agreed to the engagement!
You've got to make it so I don't
need to intervene!
If your fiancee's father finds out,
it's all over!
We've got to make the first move
before that reporter lets the story loose.
I've already informed Kim Bo Jung what to do,
just do as I say!
The people who sent us the photo said
it's only a picture of you from behind.
so we can still salvage the situation.
What does father think?
<i>Today, Ms Han Ji Soo will announce
a different scandal.</i>
Ji Soo, where are you?
Oh it's Han Ji Soo!
Ms Han Ji Soo!
Uh, we've arrived!
I'm sorry, there has been a sudden emergency.
The meal's already been prepared
so please enjoy it.
Then...
Hey, weren't we going to eat together?
What is this?
I don't know.
Don't just sit there with such a
gloomy face. Say something.
Tell me accurately...
what I have to do.
You can just say it comfortably...
"Ji Soo,
if we overcome this obstacle...
just as I promised...
I can come back to you."
Will you trust me and do exactly that?
No..
I'll do it.
I'm sorry.
Hey! That was really good, wasn't it!?
Ah don't do this.
Hey, we got a free meal thanks to you.
Oh our little Dong Baek, we should buy you
a cup of coffee!
It's alright.
Ooh, this is the first time I've received
a coffee in the Postal Office.
Why did that person come? Seriously...
Oh, the documents?
I'm seriously going to go crazy!
Seriously crazy...
Sorry. Sorry.
Manager's phone...
Where is Manager's phone number again?
What number was it?
Ooh, I have to go pee. I feel like exploding!
<i>Come out... It has to come out...</i>
<i>Don't be so pathetic.</i>
<i>He has nothing on me... just be strong!</i>
Nothing seems to be coming out.
And you said you were going to explode?
It's because I got an infection once...
Ah and this bathroom is only for employees.
If customers would use the restroom located
on the first floor lobby
I would very much appreciate it.
Mr Goo Dong Baek.
I'm a busy person.
You know very well why I came here, right?
How much did you receive from them?
Huh? What are you saying?
Fine.
I can give you a lot more so just say it.
Want double?
Triple?
Shall I quadruple it?
I really don't understand what
you're talking about!
The incident on that day...
If you confess to what really happened
I can give you anything you want.
What more do you want me to say!?
I told you absolutely everything last time!
I went to the market restaurant and
I met Ms Han Ji Soo there
but because she didn't have a license...
The runaway driver got caught on camera!!
H-How does that person pertain to me?
Are you really going to continue
acting like this?!
I told you not to get involved.
And if you do, you'll get hurt.
Do you not understand what I'm saying?!
Don't you understand?!
Are you threatening me right now?!
This gentlemen!
Do you think if you threaten me like that
I'll get scared?!
Why are you doing such an irritating thing?!
I don't have anything more to say!
What I said yesterday is absolutely everything!
And, this building is my work place so
please leave immediately!
Aish, I thought I was going to die
because I was so scared.
No matter how many times I think about it
I don't think is the right thing to do.
Ji Soo, please think about it one more time.
I'm sorry Unni. Please help me.
A scandal with an actress...
this isn't something to take lightly!
I can understand what you're
so worried about...
but I won't crumble just because of a scandal.
I'm seriously going to go crazy!
Yes?
<i>I just finished confirming everything,
it that must have been overwhelming.</i>
<i>I believe there won't be any problems.</i>
<i>Oh, and have you found you're companion?</i>
Not yet.
I'll call you back.
All right.
Fine.. let's just say we do the scandal...
but, where will we find a person in
such a short amount of time?
If it's not today, the reporters will
publish it tomorrow!
What about the newbie that
Mr Kim is raising?
What about him?
If I ask him to commit a scandal with me,
I think he'll be interested.
What happens if he refuses?
If he leaks this information,
it'll make things worse.
I'm seriously going to go crazy, really!
Someone right away?
A person we can be sure of?
What about that person?
Thank you.
Where is this place?
This is Ji Soo's house.
Yes? Ms Han Ji Soo's house?!
Let's go in.
- Please come in.
- Yes, yes.
Woww!
It's really wide and spacious!
Please sit.
Ah, yes.
You came?
Yes.
Because of the sudden invitation,
you were surprised, weren't you?
Oh, no.
To be invited in your house like this...
I really... There probably won't be
another day like this.
A problem came up...
so I wanted to make another request.
Ooh, is that so?
Please just say everything.
You did so many nice things
and put so much effort into today,
I'll do what I can.
It's a difficult request.
It's alright, even if it is difficult.
As long as whatever I can do to help
will aid in easing your troubles.
I....
Will you...
... be in a dating relationship with me?
What?

My Shoe! My Shoe! My Shoe!
Are you both really in a dating relationship?
But even if I say we are,
you won't believe me.
I'm really worried about Mr Goo Dong Baek.
I have to do well so that person won't suffer.
Because you're helping us with this,
we're giving you this car.
Have we ever agreed to do a
business transaction?
I can no longer help Ms Han Ji Soo.
You really date very extravagantly.
The two of you look very well matched.
Reporter Baek is at my house right now!
It seems he revealed that Han Ji Soo
and I are fake dating!!
