Nancy Sister "Bam bam"
The more and more I was readin
the Minister's book
the more I realized how fucked up
the whole process was.
I mean, we all have

but still we was actin like
fuckin idiots.
That nigga Josh...

If I was me, I will bury them niggas
as soon as they said some'm.

But Buns is a instigator for real.
Close door!

Fucked up...

You don't know me!
I'm the original jamaican dandatta!
You wanna ramp with

Come on! I murder
people for fun!
You wanna ramp with
bombaclad me!
When I finally found
Ox' house, there was cops everywhere.
Damn!
I drove around Queens
for a like an hour a half.
Finally I went to
Rosdale Projects.
Me and Buns used to hang
there back in the days.
When I arrived, I saw
my man Shorty out there.
Shorty was like 12
goin on 20
A real looser type nigga.
No hope for the future at all.
and he was right.
Whattup, Shorty?
On the roof?
Shot this nigga, man.
Fuckin with guns...
When you fuck with guns, Shorty...
Mad niggas is dyin.
Be careful, man.
I like your style.
For real.
Aight?
My nigga.
You're out.
Open the gate.
Buns was an animal
out of cage, for real.
All right! Here we go!
It's your court or some'm?
I'm Roger.
How you doin, Tommy?
I just came lookin for you.
For what?
When I heard that...
I wanna meet you in person.
Don't get nervous.
You gotta pay attention
and listen to me.
Listen what I tell you.
Only give you a choice.
What kind of choice?
Yeah, you got a choice.
Now you are in a lot of trouble.
Without us, you go to jail.
You go to jail forever.
You understand?
So who I gotta blest?
Someone called the Minister.
Your job is gettin in his
organization and learn his ways.
At New year's Eve he's having
a big gathering.
Armery, on Harlem.
On that night,
you'll terminate this fucker.
We'll do everythin to
help you, all the help necessary.
If you show any weakness,
or if you betrayed us...
it'll be your resignation.
Understand?
Yeah, I understand.
Don't fuck around, Buns.
But seriously...
We need to start thinkin
about us,
because this is too
dangerous now.
It's not safe anymore.
I feel like it's time for us
to go away from here.
I've been thinkin in that
for a long time.
Tee...
Let's go to Africa.
Please... Be for real.
I never been more
serious in my life.
We been in everywhere.
Who says we can't go
to Africa?
I mean...
I don't know...
Africa is far.
So what?
I'm just sayin.
Think about us.
That's our dream.
Go to homeland.
Where our root are.
Fuck it, man...
Forget about money.
Fuck everything.
Is the chance of our lifetime.
If you and me went...
and the baby.
Just think.
Maybe is the right thing to do.
Maybe not.
I'll think about it.
Buns, was supposed
to take out the Minister.
Apparently, they need a nigga to do it,
And Tommy was perfect.
He had to start from the bottom,
really take it serious.
With the religion.
He had to study
and really be a part of it.
Cause it wasn't be easy
to get close to the Minister.
Meanwhile, Knowledge and
Shameek...
You know, for a little
payback.
And Knowledge knew where Kisha lived.
the more, you know,
the truth is like the light.
No matter what clouds the truth.
Eventually the sun
will come out.
And you cannot stop the sun
from shining.
For the first time the sun
was finally shinin on Bundy.
What the fuck are you
doin in my house?
Relax, Shorty.
Nobody'll fuck with you.
Word up.
Why you don't get your
stinky ass out of my
motherfuckin house...
and take out your
broke-ass niggas with you?
We're just here lookin for this nigga,
hoping maybe Since...
can tell us where he is.
Shit...
Don't worry.
Just tell Sin.
We don't mean to worry the God
but we really need to find this fucker.
You fuckin serious?
A'yo, peace, shorty.
Stay cool.
Don't hurt nobody.
God...
I can't believe it.
He wanna meet me up in Harlem.
I don't even know what's goin on.
First of all, how the fuck
he got out the jail?
Maybe this nigga...
It could be a set up.
You can't even tell with this nigga.
You know, Buns is my dawg, but...
This nigga is hard to tell sometimes.
He could be ill when
he wanna be.
Yo, Buns, what up, nigga?
How you doin?
I been tryin to call you.
How you don't call me back?
Hard to tell.
I went to Ox' house...
then I called Mark
to tell him what happened.
I got no response.
Hard about Ox...
You know, Sin?
You be always right.
We were in the road destruction
from the begining.
The Minister
show us the right path.
Listen, dawg.
We all make mistakes.
Especially me.
If you got to change to make it right,
make it right.
I feel it's the only way.
I don't feel a need to play the whole
part in the entire movement.
but, if you just raise your
family right,
if I just live righteously,
I be aight...
My whole life is dedicated
to change.
I'm goin to Africa.
Word?
Africa?
between you, me,...
the whole world.
That's ill, son.
That's ill.
What can I say...
Congratulations.
Good luck on your trip
to the Motherland.
Good lookin, Buns.
I hope everything is right with
you and the Minister as well.
What you wan' me do with
the car and all that?
What you wanna me do
with all that?
I don't really need all that.
Accept that as a gift.
From to the heart.
And remember...
Dope. Had to be secure to leave it
in that office.
Is extremely important that
they found shit on the Minister's.
Under no circunstances.
You copy that?
Yeah, I copy that.
You my nigga.
Tee!
- Tee!
- I'm here, Sin.
Why you sit over there?
What happened?
I went home, there's some
niggas in the house.
They're lookin for you.
He said his name was Sha...
But I think they
lookin for Tommy.
- They touched you?
- No.
I got scared.
But they left quietly.
I was sitting here...
They dead.
You gotta promise.
You gotta promise me.
You just say fuck this shit.
And just leave it alone.
You got to swear that
you're not go lookin for them.
I can't take this shit no more.
We just do what you said...
You forget about Tommy,
about all this shit.
I start thinkin about us.
And split and go to Africa,
we just should go.
We just should go.
I don't know how you
can stay here.
Shit got crazy every day.
Me, my wife...
we'll be out.
You goin to Africa
and stop fuckin with weed?
I don't even fuck with
no more chronic.
I don't need none
of that shit again.
You're a lucky nigga.
Long-ass flight, too.
I never comin back.
Never comin back.
Word!
My nigga.
Sin, what's up, baby?
You lookin good, brother.
Yo, what up, Black,
funny-ass nigga?
What's the deal?
Remember that shit from
the basement?
Take this, man!
Tee, I got shot.
What?
This nigga shot me in my leg.
I had to shot to this two other niggas.
What?
The nigga that shot me.
I killed that nigga.
Sin...
I don't give a fuck.
We still gon' go.
Nothin stop us from leavin.
I don't give a fuck no more.
We goin.
Is Knowledge.
Damn.
That nigga can't leave, son.
I know where Tommy's bitch live at.
35, Westchester.
I gon' go see that bitch.
- For you, son.
- Get that bitch.
Bring that nigga on the front!
No doubt.
You are a beautiful people.
A people deserving an a saviour.
A God who loves you
and I so much...
that he'll---
climb a mountain
40 miles high.
Just to save one of you!
I knew you were coming.
So I sent everyone away...
because I believed my final moment
was at hand.
Before you pull that trigger,
and take my life,
I would like the chance to
tell you some things,
perhaps to think about
after I am gone.
Don't worry about me stallin.
My people have orders
to leave me to my studies
for another 15 minutes.
I will only take 5.
Can you bear with me?
Will you?
Then make up your mind.
Today marks the change of
not only a New Year,
but a new Millenium.
Take a look around.
The majority of the youth roam
the streets...
dealing in drugs, sex and violence,
thinking these things
have no real effect on life.
Crimes without real punishment.
An uncaring, unfeeling generation...
without knowledge of self.
This is the future of our nation,
the future of our people.
Do you think hatred and evil
will go unpunished?
The world is now feeling the heat...
from flames it has kept burning
since the beginning of civilization.
You represent that fire.
You and I...
are just a small part of God's plan.
The evil men of this world have
applied every method possible...
to deceive its occupants.
And each time with greater
success than anticipated.
But no more.
Tonight, with this new millennium,
God will begin to overcome
this evil.
I represent the truth
to the people.
Without truth, nothing is sacred.
The lie-that's what the
devil is all about.
You know that,
that's why you're here.
What the hell?!
The truth is,
we all play a grave role...
in our own destruction.
Your money.
Your lifestyles.
The things that people value and
covet so dearly...
are the bait that lures them
out of the light.
Turn over, bitch.
Where the fuck is that
bitch-ass nigga?
Huh?
Through the love of others...
I have power
The truth gives me this.
Those that fear me send you here,
here to murder all that I say.
They use what you fear
against you.
Your fear of death,
your fear of imprisonment.
Where in this world is anyone
safe from death?
You see the lies
you've been told?
The path you take is not
your own.
Now you turn around, bitch!
Punk-ass motherfucker!
Look what you did to me!
I hate you!
Have you ever thought about
how precious a life is?
How difficult it is to create?
How loosely and easily it has been
for you to take away?
Brother, help me.
Help me to do what's right.
Help me to stop the slaughter
of our children.
Help me to put an end to the
disrespect and the dishonor...
of our most valuable resource:
the black woman.
Help me put an end to the
destruction of the young mind...
through the use of drugs, alcohol.
Help me to build up a population
of great thinkers.
People who create change...
through thoughtfulness
and spirituality.
Will you choose that truth?
Will you?
Will you choose the light over
the darkness?
Once I found out the clock was ticking,
it's get the glock, I'mma stick him,
nah, kill 'em cause revenge is all a
nigga think about in the end,
but I'm goin' on a binge,
brother, to my sins.
fuck you all, niggas!
Born by myself, die by myself.
And if you don't know
what it's gon' be in the end...
T minus
3, 2, 1...
Amen.
- Drop the gun!
- Hold it! Stay where you are
Will you choose life?
It's time.
It's time, man.
It's time.
When I opened my eyes
I couldn't believe it.
Africa for real!
I felt like I never really
see clouds before.
I felt like the sky was
a different color blue.
The trees different color green.
And the people too.
The people were beautiful.
It felt right.
It was harmony.
Like I wasn't gone from home.
Everybody together.
Me, Tionne, Kenya.
It was like...
a whole new beginning.
