Previously on Veronica Mars...
I like being sweet to you.
I'm really glad.
- So you sell tests.
- Yeah, it's not easy.
- Tell me you're a business major.
- Philosophy.
You've been so sweet to me. I've just...

I can't believe this is a class.
Hey, without film studies,
how will we know what movies mean?
So...
Piz didn't say anything...
about the whole party... thing?
Like how you two made out in the hall
And then you took off?
Why? Is he calling you all the time?
He called once.
The day after.
But... how would you interpret his mood?
You want me to have this talk?
- Am I a 12 year old girl?
- No.
But you're drinking fresca and
watching Joan Crawford movies.
Look, I told you be honest,
let him down easy. But...
So he's gone all mushy.
I don't know.
My interpretation of Piz's mood... normal.
So is the girl talk over?
I'm trying to watch the women here.
How was your day?
It's official: two fewer burglaries
this month than last.
I smell a trend.
And the registration deadline
for the special election is monday.
So you're running...
Unopposed.
Might stand a chance.
Okay, Johnny Scopes and
Desmond Fellows met where?
NYU, dean's office
Johnny dropping out and Desmond expelled.
Formed My Pretty Pony the next day.
Score one for Arnold.
"Black cat", "you break me, you buy me",
"Jesus saves, but where does he shop?"
Their last album was released...?
'96 "More problems". Game over.
"The wake E.P.", 1997,
Released over Desmond's
objections after Johnny died.
Their official last album.
Oh.
Congratulations, Piz. Job's yours.
You replace Joe.
There's a lot riding on this. Don't blow it.
Hey, veronica, guess what.
What?
You know my pretty pony?
Yeah. I totally love them.
I know, right?
So, Desmond fellows is coming to hearst.
And guess who just won
the my pretty pony off
and gets to be his guide?
- I'm guessing you?
- Mm hmm.
Wow. That's awesome.
Why is he coming here?
One of our idiot deejays swore on air,
And the fcc is literally
fining us into oblivion,
So we got Desmond to come
play a fund raiser to pay them off.
Otherwise the station is dead.
Johnny scopes died, didn't he?
Yeah, but Desmond has the actuall
backing tapes with johnny's vocals,
So he plays all the my pretty pony
songs along to the tapes.
It's just awesome.
This guy is like one of my all time heroes.
And I can get tickets
if you maybe want to...
Yeah. Maybe.
Um... I'll see.
I got to run. I'm late.
.. as you can clearly see.
And finally, consider this
Do you know anyone
who doesn't wear shoes?
Very nice, donaldson.
So...
Logan Echolls.
What have you got for us?
Uh, actually, I was hoping
I could present my business plan on monday.
Why am I not surprised?
I didn't get the chance to
say this on the way over,
but I was the biggest my pretty pony fan.
Sweet.
Hey, that's my drink, right?
Uh, yeah tonic and ice.
Hope this is okay. Nicest place in Neptune.
All the amenities.
What's he still doing here?
Waiting for the tip.
It's a customary thing... in America.
Here you are, my good man.
That'll get you 20 bones on ebay.
- Why?
- I'm Desmond Fellows.
Obviously, he's not cool.
We'll leave that for the room service guy.
You know what, Fez? I'm pretty beat.
Why don't you go out,
see if you can't grab us
a few of those old mini
bottles off of a cart?
I'm just gonna catch some z's.
Surprise.
Whoa.
You really do have all the amenities.
You said surprise me, so...
Surprise.
Right.
I said...
Who are you?
Um...
Blackcat70.
Arr!
All the e-mails?
"Surprise me when I'm in town".
Uh...
That was you?
Oh, my god.
Right.
Misunderstanding.
Thunder is
Here we're drying apples.
Apples for apple...
Going to be gabriel's thunder.
Ramone goose is a double tonight.
Sorry.
Do come see the show.
Advice never meet your idol.
More advice always confirm
the accuracy of photos.
So you said there was a beach?
Uh, yeah. More than one.
Yeah.
Or we could forget the beach.
Go to Mexico. Get really weird.
Mexico I'm not sure we can do.
Show's off, so why not?
What? W- why?
All the backing tapes and stuff
used to be in this bag.
Now it contains only this.
Veronica Mars 3x17 - Debasement Tapes
Is the eggplant good?
It's okay.
How about that stuff?
It's good.
It's probably horrible for you, right?
I'll stay with the eggplant.
No, wait. What do you think?
I need to see a psychiatrist.
I was thinking more an english professor.
What we're dealing with here
is an absurd level of symbolism.
- Two veggie lasagnas.
- Okay.
Symbolism.
I mean, the Bronson parmesan
is good for me, but ooh!
The Maxuccine looks awfully tempting.
It's not my fault Max won't stop calling.
Like you should talk.
Me? I'm not ordering good boy
while wishing I ordered bad boy.
No. You gave up bad boy
but keep asking for samples of good boy.
No. I...
Wait, what?
Okay, if Logan is the fettuccine
It's the eggplant.
Piz.
Actually, I wanted to talk to you, too.
I... need to apologize.
At the party, I was irresponsible.
I think we should file the party
away and just be friends...
For now.
I kind of got that.
I'm actually calling 'cause
I need help with a case thing.
Oh.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Forget something?
No, just saying hi.
I haven't seen you since Parker's party.
What brings you here?
Oh, just... a case thing.
Actually, can I ask you something?
The weekend that you
almost got your head shaved,
Your dad said you were staying at Wallace's.
It was just you and Piz, huh?
Yes, but, no.
No.
I mean, I slept in Wallace's bed,
it was just a place to stay.
Nothing was...
Oh, thank god you're here.
Uh... hey.
Hey.
Good luck.
Empty. Just a hotel robe stuck
in there to make it look full.
Look, without those tapes, he can't...
Hey, Puss, this is all we have left,
which I won't touch.
You need to contact management immediate...
Hey, is that your girlfriend?
Uh, no, just a friend.
Veronica. Hi. I'm a really big fan.
You're just using him to get to me.
Mercenary. I like it.
I'm doing a show tomorrow night.
If you want to hang backstage, Monica...
Her dad's a P. I.
She's gonna help us find
the woman who took the tapes.
Oh, yeah, I think I figured
that whole thing out.
Come here. Check it out.
Is that the woman?
That was my mistake.
That's blackcat80.
The woman in my room was blackcat70.
Number trouble.
So, do you have any pictures
of the woman who was in your room?
No.
Anyone ever tell you
You look like a feisty young Barbara Eden?
How did she know you'd be here?
How old are you, monica?
I'm 11.
You arranged this how?
Instant messaging.
But I didn't save any of the...
Wow. All business.
Deadly.
Yeah, there she is blackcat70.
It's a shame she was so old.
She seemed cool.
So you didn't get her name?
Just blackcat70.
What's that?
She try and draw herself?
It's a chinese character.
I know a couple guys taking chinese.
We could ask them.
It's a start.
Was there anything in the bag?
Just medications, pills.
What are you taking pills for?
Ah, you know.
Life.
You ever have that nightmare
where you forget you're taking a class
and you have to take the final?
No.
I have to come up with an
entire business plan by monday.
Dude, that's a bummer.
Oh!
What are you doing?
Getting famous.
Who is that?
Dude, that's me.
Ghost ridin' the whip! Check it out.
♪ Now gas, brake, yeah
♪ Gas, brake, yeah
♪ Shake them treads
♪ Let me see you show your grille
You run over your own foot?
Yeah, which is why
I think I have a real shot...
at the top of the charts.
This is something people do?
Cool people.
You did good for your first time.
Next time, it'll be easier.
The next and last time I run
Will be to chase down and kill
The inventor of ultimate frisbee.
Hello?
Hey, Logan. Parker's not here.
Me?
Grade my ass.
Dot net, yes.
I need to present a viable
business plan for a class.
I need a lowest common denominator
Website with a simple, interactive element
That I can build a business plan around.
You can put this together in your sleep.
I'll pay.
And the catch? It's due monday morning.
I'll need red bull and licorice.
Deal.
You're on the air
With Desmond fellows of my pretty pony,
Playing a benefit tomorrow
night at liberty lunch,
Brought to you by wrigley's extra gum.
Okay, caller, are you there?
Their leftover gum?
The brand.
Extra gum.
Sugarless.
Okay, caller, are you there?
Desmond, you rock.
Make sure you play "You
break me" tomorrow, okay?
Oh, yeah. All the old hit.
You bet.
Hey, are you that redhead
out in the food court?
How do you feel about
showing me those big old...
Okay! Uh...
Second caller, you're on with Desmond.
Dude, you suck.
Oh, hey, thanks a lot, man.
So, what's your question?
You just scrounge money off
the memory of your dead partner.
How do you live with yourself?
Well, I drink heavily, and I abuse drugs.
Hack!
Moving on. You're on with with Desmond.
I'm calling from semites for the savior.
We want everyone to know
this man makes songs
that mock our religious beliefs.
You're a jewish group,
and your initials are S. S.?
Oh, god.
We encourage everyone to pray with us,
and he cancels the show and...
Nazi gonna happen.
Now, don't worry about it.
The show's canceling itself.
I would pray, instead, for a girlfriend.
Hey, what's up? It's Des.
Dude, party, miller hall, room 404, tonight.
Got a pen?
That was great. Home, please.
Piz?
What did he mean, canceling itself?
It's nothing.
He just misplaced the backing tapes.
It's no big deal.
You know what happens
if we have to cancel this show.
Fax! Come on, this ain't night court.
Sacks!
Where are those drug stats?
- Sheriff.
- Leo.
Sheriff Mars.
What brings you around here?
I was hoping I could have a word with you.
What have you been up to, Leo?
Doing security at sport haus,
Which is what I wanted to talk to you about.
I was on the afternoon shift,
And I noticed one of the stock
guys acting kind of weird
Making calls from the pay
phone across the street,
Taking the occasional photo of the floors,
Back offices on the cellphone.
What, like he's casing the joint? Kind of.
And I noticed a new name
on the cleaning crew roster.
Danny Boyd.
Fitzpatrick flunky.
I tell my supervisor my concerns.
He says he'll look into it.
Next day, I'm switched to a new shift.
Something's not right.
Danny boyd, huh?
I'm friendly with a judge
Who might give me a tap on boyd's phone.
Stay put, and I'll see what I can do.
What I want to know is how did that guy
Write cool, insightful songs?
Or did Johnny do the good ones?
Desmond wrote all the good ones.
I think he's just tired.
He's been on the road all spring.
We got class in five minutes, so...
Veronica, Vincent, Marty.
I figured, between them, they'd know.
We need to figure out what that means.
Okay.
So, this represents what's the word?
It's like a pleasing quality, you know?
Like... charming.
Or more.
It's a spiritual quality,
but like charming or effortless.
God.
I got it grace. Grace. Right, yeah.
What?
Look, I... What is say?
Pretty pony huge was fan.
Desmond and I exchanged messages.
And believe it or not,
I wasn't always a boring
associate professor of chinese.
I was once... rather wild.
Was? You climbed down from
the room above on a sheet.
We're not the wild patrol.
We just need his stuff back.
What stuff?
From his bag... that you took after
I didn't take anything.
You were the only one
alone with his backpack.
He was a jerk, so
I didn't take anything, kids.
Professor Schaffer,
the situation is life and death.
There was medication in there,
which Desmond needs...
To live.
Oh, my god. Is he okay?
I'll cancel my class.
Okay, we'll call my doctor.
What's he missing?
So you believe her?
I kind of do.
She would have given a kidney
to Desmond had we asked.
Who was that guy who called
Praying Desmond's show was canceled?
Semites for the savior.
Maybe they heard that god is now helping
Those that help themselves.
So, look wise, you're
thinking bright, fun, simple.
Well, accessible.
Quick loading to maximize click throughs.
Don't put the best asses at the top.
Make people hunt for them.
I compiled studies of browsing behavior
And drew up ratios of
But you don't want them too hidden.
If you can't find the good ones,
you'll feel cheated.
And his role in this enterprise?
Consultant. I'm an ass expert.
Yes, except for the expert part.
I'm an ass?
Who would you ask for advice
about lions, a lion or a gerbil?
Gerbil, you say? No, you would ask a lion,
Because by virtue of being a lion,
A lion is an expert on lions.
So...
Okay. I don't see how you
hope to launch a website
About hot asses without me, but fine.
It's friday night.
If I walk long enough in
a straight line, I'll hit a party.
State legislators will
meet later in the week
to discuss a bill banning
the sale of condoms...
I take it you failed.
We found the groupie,
But she said she
didn't take the tapes, so...
We have some other leads.
We'll find the tapes and get them back
Do the show,
and I'm a ha a a a ck.
Party time. What to wear?
What was that?
- The song?
- That?
Nothing.
- It's a... thing.
- No. It's cool.
It reminds me of the demo
on the wild parties reissue.
Indie rock or rock rock?
Rock rock.
'Cause the bad boys get the chicks.
I mean, look at you.
You're single, and you're very nice, Pez.
There's a correlation.
Do you still write stuff?
Well, people want to
hear the old hits, so, no.
What about the one you just played?
That was a cool song.
There's no bridge.
Who cares, anyway, you know?
I play the old hits,
I get paid, go to parties.
If it ain't broke...
- It's gonna be a lame party.
- Really?
I should go to Mexico.
I mean, if you stay here
working on the song,
you wouldn't miss much.
My stuff's locked up in the club.
I got a guitar in my room.
Well, if it's gonna be a lame party, maybe.
I'll be back in 15 minutes, okay?
78 year old woman
neighbor opened the door,
Pointed a shotgun at them,
And then chased the girl
scout and her father
Off her property with the loaded weapon.
And finally, a blast from the past.
After 10 years in the
where are they now? File,
Desmond fellows appears tomorrow

Sorry about that. Go.
Drew Barrymore.
Yeah.
Rose Mcgowan.
Ooh. Yes.
- Jennifer Move Hewitt.
- Twice.
Dude, you are my idol.
Who are you?
So, you surviving?
Surviving what?
Helping Piz.
You know, his puppy
dog eyes on you all the time.
It's weird.
Like you said, normal Piz.
Like... nothing ever happened.
Which bothers you because
making out with you
Is supposed to be some
life changing experience.
I don't know. I just...
Why are we talking about this?
I thought you loved these
kind of conversations.
No.
I was hoping we could follow it up
With a cuteness countdown
of the baldwin brothers.
I hope we're still
friends after I taser you.
So this is totally modular.
You can swap out content whenever.
Like franchisable.
You want to do boobs, legs, kitts, whatever,
You can have a new site
up and going instantly.
And bring your advertisers along.
Okay, we'll sell that in the pitch.
So the difference between
income models would be what?
Eh. Not exactly my hacker forte.
Information wants to be free.
But I know someone who kind of knows.
Well, could we call this someone?
Max?
Yeah, hi.
Buzz! Bizen! Dude, you're in time!
We're going skinny dipping!
Okay, the key to good skinny dipping is...
What I call total nakedness.
It's not just physical nakedness
but spiritual, as well.
La paz, capital of Bolivia...
get weird, man!
This is my lifestyle!
Whoo hoo hoo! Whoo! Whoo!
Whoo hoo hoo!
God, in his heaven, it's freezing.
Oh, my god, I don't recommend this!
Hey, man, want to turn that off?
It really kills the mood.
"Hey, Jude", "Yesterday", "Get back".
Catchy tunes, yes. Rock 'n' roll, no.
What kind of musician
doesn't recognize the Beatles
As the greatest rock band of all time?
I don't recognize them
as a rock band at all.
They were... tunesmiths.
Hey, man, I didn't get all pissy
When you denied my claim
That marshal Dillon was
the greatest sheriff of all time.
Marshal Dillon was a marshal,
And, more importantly, is fictional.
That's what the Beatles are to me fictional.
"Revolution", "hey, jude"
these were real songs, man.
Norwegian wood.
I sorry. I'm sorry.
I used to know a rent boy from
oslo who called himself that.
Uh, mr. Mars, I think Desmond
is just winding you up.
Most critics reference the Beatles influence
In Desmond's material.
Oh, you mean those Beatles.
I'm sorry.
I thought you meant the other ones
With the two e's from the lower east side.
No, they're totally fictional.
John, Paul, George, and the drummer?
Oh, those guys are awesome.
Veronica, could you have
sacks bring me the leg irons?
Come on, dad. Let it be.
Here's what I did on my term paper site.
Break it down.
For the lazy, search and
credit button right there.
For the dumb, billable links at
the top disguised as functions.
So they link without realizing.
And I make a dollar.
See, the point of the internet
Is to make money off stupid people.
I like how you think, Max.
That sound you hear is my
idealism quietly shattering.
That other sound you hear
Is my cynicism laughing at
your idealism shattering.
It won't be laughing when I'll
crash your greedy little evil website.
I'll be laughing when you try.
Will you? Maybe I'm in your
trusted host table already.
Should I get a camera?
There's got to be someone that'll pay
To see this hot nerd on nerd action.
Welcome to Semites for the Savior.
- Hi.
- Shalom.
Who's in charge here?
Me. You guys interested in joining?
- No.
- Yes, we are.
And we want to know what you guys are doing
- To try and stop that Desmond fellows show.
- That guy?
We sent a sternly worded
letter to the dean's office.
- And we also called...
- Realistically.
Like a real way to, you know...
Take care of it.
- Veronica.
- Yeah?
That was the bellboy who showed
Desmond and me to the room.
Ratner.
Oh, great.
What are you gonna accuse me of this time?
Hmm. How about...
Stealing Desmond Fellows' backing tapes?
Congratulations.
Wrong again.
You had Desmond's bags in your possession.
You're a member of a group
protesting his presence.
That, to me, is a thing
that makes you go, hmm?
What's the thing that makes you go away?
I didn't know who that guy
was until George told me.
Who else could have put
the hotel robe in there?
- You got access.
- What robe?
The big, blue hotel robe in the bag.
You said it was a neptune grand robe.
Yeah. A fluffy blue robe.
Neptune grand robes aren't...
- Blue.
- They're white.
Okay. I'm apologizing.
I'm sorry for thinking you were guilty.
I don't accept your apology.
I'll live.
So, can I see the bag and the robe?
Right. Not a neptune grand robe.
So, what that's a clue?
What kind?
Nothing else was in there.
So... did you solve it?
Yes.
The answer is danny cleaver's bag
And all my time this weekend.
What are two things you
didn't mean to take but did?
- Huh?
- This isn't your bag.
You must have switched at
the airport with danny cleaver.
It's a los angeles phone number,
And the show is in four hours, so...
We should have your
tapes back right on time.
Danny cleaver?
Did you happen to notice that
your backpack was full of tapes?
I've been kind of hung over.
My bags are still in the car.
How does this guy make it
through airport security?
Johnny's vocals from 'more problems. '
This album, my freshman year of high school,
I had a job washing dishes
at a nursing home,
But all the boss did
Was talk about bar fights and
weird sexual encounters.
How weird?
Worst year of my life.
But an off brand mp3 player and
this album got me through it.
When I was on dance team,
I tried to convince them
To do a routine to why you shot me down,
But changed the words
to we threw a touchdown.
Wait, you were, uh...
you were on a dance team?
I was a dance teamer with a deep soul.
Hmm.
Plus, I thought Desmond was cute.
Who knew he'd turn out
to be such a wastoid lech?
I don't think he's always been like that.
Still, it's gonna be a good show.
I'm glad we saved it.
Good thing I got the nerve to call you.
Why wouldn't you have called?
You know.
I thought it might be awkward.
Me and you... after... that.
Yeah.
I'm glad it's not.
Awkward.
Oh, it is. No, I'm very uncomfortable.
I thought it would be
even more uncomfortable.
New crap?
What album was that?
This is not an album.
He said he'd been working on some new stuff.
He actually, uh... played some stuff for me.
It was pretty cool.
♪ She picked me out of the millions
♪ Thumbing an o. E.D.
♪ Dressed me down to civilian
♪ Cracks the code on the rosetta stone
♪ Says the word for alone is alone
That truck it shouldn't be here.
They're getting an early start.
What?
Danny Boyd.
It's happening now.
Those are guns.
Jeez.
Vinnie?
He was their man getting
the security layout?
Yeah.
- How do we play it?
- Wait for backup.
- Keith?
- Yeah, Sacks, it's me.
I'm at sport haus, and
there's a robbery in progress.
Get some cars down here.
Yeah?
Someone else just called
to report a robbery at sport haus.
He says he trapped them inside the store.
Isn't that where you are?
Vinnie.
What are you doing here?
Working for a living.
Owner hired me.
Got wind of some foul play,
and he brought me in.
So I infiltrated their gang, and...
Sealed with a kiss, sheriff.
Hey, Vinnie, open the door!
Vinnie, open the door!
Are you kidding?
Desmond.
Just waiting on the tapes.
They should be here any second.
I never should have let Piz handle this.
You know, if we have to refund those tickets
Piz, where are you?
It's for you.
Hey, man. Did you get the tapes?
Yeah, we got them,
but we're stuck in traffic,
And I don't think we'll make it in time.
Oh, man. How long?
Well, there's an accident. I don't know.
Is there anything you can
do until we get there?
Did you ever finish any of those new songs?
Um...
Maybe a few.
Can you start with one of those?
Uh... let me think about it.
You realize you've left
your fate in the hands
Of a spineless and semi alcoholic
Has been rock star.
What are you gonna do?
So, I- I bet you all want to hear
some my pretty pony hits, huh?
Um... how about some new solo material?
All right, new solo material it is, then.

Thank you.
Pez, you made it.
Hey, were you able to catch
the end of the show, at least?
Yeah, we caught the whole thing.
Were you screwing with me?
I wanted to hear the new stuff.
It was just it was awesome.
It was awesome.
You're a bad man, piznarski.
Is this about right?
You're all set to fleece idiots.
Thanks for helping us out.
Hey, free food. Why not?
Just remember, you got to link to me.
Sure you want to compromise your reputation
On your cheating site with
a link to our ass site?
Anything to help you guys out.
You up for breakfast tomorrow?
I've got to finish up.
Rain check.
What?
Nothing.
Hey.
You're still kind of a jerk, but...
- That was kind of incredible.
- Thank you.
Want to go grab a drink, get away
from all these damn kids?
If I do say so, a... m ass terpiece.
So what's up with veronica and Piz?
She...
She, like, dating him or what?
She's trying to let him down easy.
But...
I don't know. When we were
When we were dating,
did they ever... you know?
No more talk of Veronica's love life.
Ever.
But I will say, if you think
she was unfaithful,
You're an idiot.
Now, if you'll excuse me...
It's morning.
Okay.
So it's what, just "Mac"?
Actually, forget the check.
How about a 50% stake?
So you're part owner.
Saw his numbers and figured
I'd be a millionaire by 2050.
- Bronson.
- Hmm?
I, uh...
You're a great guy, Bronson. You really are.
And I really feel almost insane saying this,

The average teen spends
16 hours a week online
And clicks on hundreds of links.
And in this day and age,
Someone is there to make

The female posterior.
It commands a huge slice
Of the average surfer's online attention.

You can't buy that kind of publicity.
