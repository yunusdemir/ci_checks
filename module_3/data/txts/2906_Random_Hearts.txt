<i>I'm heading for the airport early.</i>
<i>Meet me for coffee.</i>
Random Hearts (1999)
They're gonna mark you tardy.
I've got court today.
You working late?
I can if you are.
Thought I'd take you to the Palm.
I'm wanna get my dad
one of those weather radios.
The nothing but weather ones?
Now that he's on the water.
Get him a book. Let him dope it out
for himself. He'd like that.
You'd like that.
He doesn't think
the weatherman's gonna lie to him.
He wants to know
if a hurricane's coming.
What's wrong with the Palm?
It's Friday night.
It'll be crowded.
You like it crowded.
Okay, let's go to the Palm.
If you're just killing time--
Help!
Did he talk about God?
Ask if God said anything back.
If we can get him to say
God speaks to him--
That thing's cordless.
What else did he say?
Baloney!
Tru, she's on the phone.
She'll be right down.
What does he know
about the democratic process?
I gotta go.
- Got any cash?
- Sure.
I need a half a million bucks.
Harold Cornelius is gonna run
against me as a write-in.
- He's a nut case.
- With drugstores and a lot of money.
- Where're you going?
- New York.
New Hampshire will not stand for him
buying a seat in Congress.
- This guy is Elmer Fudd.
- Yeah, sure.
Jessie's birthday is Wednesday.
I said we'd both be home.
Sure.
<i>Attention all aircraft. Convective</i>
<i>Sigmet three Echo in effect...</i>
<i>for Washington-Baltimore area</i>.
<i>A line of thunderstorms</i>
<i>60 miles wide moving...</i>
<i>from 260 degrees at 15 knots</i>
<i>with tops to flight level 350.</i>
<i>Wind gusts to 60 knots</i>
<i>and possible lightning.</i>
I said I wouldn't take PAC money.
That's when we didn't need it.
What do I say now?
Do you swear to tell the whole truth,
so help you God?
I do.
Name and occupation
for the jury, please.
William Van Den Broeck. I'm a sergeant
in the Internal Affairs Division...
of the District of Columbia
Police Department.
What's your job?
Internal Affairs is responsible
for investigating...
incidents or allegations
of misconduct...
<i>involving sworn officers and civilian</i>
<i>employees of the District of Columbia.</i>
<i>Plane to Miami now boarding.</i>
Does he think we'll let him
get away with that?
Depose Henry.
Sure.
I'll see you.
Sergeant Van Den Broeck...
you had to take a test
to make sergeant, didn't you?
There's a written exam.
If I put into evidence records that show
56 officers took the same test as you...
and you did better than 54 of them,
would that be about right?
Look it up.
The point is,
you're a smart guy.
Number two on the written,
11 years as sergeant.
How come you're not a lieutenant?
- Where are we going with this?
- Think it's 'cause you're white?
Get out! She cannot do that!
Your Honor?
<i>From 11 News,</i>
<i>this is a special report.</i>
May I help you?
I'm looking for a gift for my wife.
Is there an all-weather radio
or just for weather?
It's for my father-in-law in Florida.
I got a couple back here.
I'll show you.
<i>From a Southern Airline spokesperson...</i>
<i>a normal crew is two pilots</i>
<i>and three cabin attendants.</i>
<i>The aircraft involved was a 737...</i>
<i>which normally is configured</i>
<i>for seats from 96 to 138--</i>
- Where's this?
- Down in the Bay.
Anything happening?
School cops at King took a nine
out of this girl's locker.
Same gun got logged into evidence
six weeks ago. Weapon in a drive-by.
<i>...at an altitude of reportedly</i>
<i>8,000 feet...</i>
<i>when it veered off course</i>
<i>and began a steep descent.</i>
The only thing he isn't short on
is cash.
He will buy a million dollars' worth
of TV time...
and hide behind the best advertising
money can buy.
I can beat him if I can get
on television myself.
The issue here is whether someone
totally unsuited for public office...
can buy his way into
the United States Congress.
I hope your answer's no.
I said "buy"
too many times, right?
Let's eat.
You got no lunchroom here?
Here's what we got.
We got a gun that was used in a homicide
and killed someone.
Then it got stolen
out of the property room.
Maybe some cop sold it.
Then we've got you
in possession of that gun.
We ain't got no lunchroom.
Some fool say he found
some gun in my locker.
I wouldn't know. I wasn't there.
I ain't possessing nothing.
How did it get in your locker, Shyla?
Don't use my Christian name
like we gonna be friends.
It's my impression you weren't
in the market for corporate support.
I hate making these calls.
I thought I wouldn't have to,
but now I need the money.
We had a good relationship
with your father.
He understood the communications
business. We appreciated that.
- Who's doing your media?
- I guess I was.
Never needed much till Cornelius
came out of left field-- Right field.
What do you think of Carl Broman?
<i>Offshore breeze and clearing this</i>
<i>afternoon. Low tonight in the 70s.</i>
So?
Juvenile's got her brother
for knocking over gas stations.
She's holding for him...
but she ain't gonna talk to us.
- We can get her a week in detention.
- Yeah? How?
I'll lose her paperwork.
You'd do that?
Hold her without a charge?
For a week? Sure. If she wants
to go home, maybe we get a name.
Dutch, line three.
Van Den Broeck.
Clayton and George Beaufort.
Friday's payday, I guess.
Stick with them until
Alcee and I catch up with you.
I want this son of a bitch.
Alcee, we're on the roll.
I didn't do anything.
We were just talking.
Don't even think that way.
Shit like that makes people hate cops.
Grab a radio.
You got a car for me?
Not the "pimpmobile."
This is surveillance, not narcotics.
This is it.
Your wife called when you were in court.
Things came up at work.
She can't eat with you.
Call before you go home.
<i>The tail section of the Southern</i>
<i>Airliner is sticking out of the water.</i>
<i>You can hear choppers.</i>
<i>Choppers are getting a better look.</i>
<i>Search and rescue operations--</i>
<i>About an hour ago, with a reported</i>
<i>103 passengers on board.</i>
There's Clayton.
What the hell is he doing?
- What is this clown doing?
- I don't know.
Where's George?
Wait a minute.
Get Elton and Tommy back here quick.
Tom, we need you guys back here.
Something's going down.
Clayton?
How you doin'?
What's goin' on?
Where's George?
Where's your partner?
In the basement.
The basement?
What's he doing in the basement?
A guy named Marvin is pouring booze
without a license.
We're gettin' ready to write him.
He comes up with a shotgun,
says he wants money.
Tells me to go get it.
He's got George down there.
Somebody's holding George Beaufort
hostage.
Send us an ear.
What's the plan, Officer?
We could call the police.
Is that what you're getting ready
to do, call the police?
There's a lot of police here already.
The guy's got a gun on George.
We gotta do something.
Oh, no. We're Internal Affairs.
You got a policeman that screws up...
you got a policeman
that abuses his position, steals...
that's us.
What do you think's going on here?
You think we just happened by?
We've been on you all day, all week.
We've been on you all month.
You know what I think's going on?
Somebody got sick and tired
of paying you off.
You corroborate that,
gives us a reason...
to drag George's sorry ass
out of the basement.
Otherwise, we'll talk to the guy with
the shotgun, see what his version is.
You asking me to turn George in?
Just push me and push me.
Marvin? Marvin?
Marvin, I'm Sergeant Van Den Broeck.
Hello, asshole.
You're under arrest.
<i>Who is the real Kay Chandler?</i>
<i>What's she stand for?</i>
<i>Do you know?</i>
<i>What's she doing in Congress anyway?</i>
<i>Harold Cornelius</i>
<i>for your congressman</i>.
Shirley Magnuson did it.
Pretty good.
You think so?
She knows you'll run
as Arthur Spencer's daughter.
She can't go after him.
He's dead.
And when he wasn't,
he got a lot of votes.
All she does is ask
a couple of questions.
And the subtext is: She only
got elected 'cause of her daddy.
She didn't earn it.
This is America, and that ain't fair.
I'm not running
as Arthur Spencer's daughter.
- Will you run as "nice person"?
- I have my own record.
City Attorney?
National Committeewoman?
A record is when somebody who votes
remembers what you did for them.
- I beat Harvey Galin five to three.
- My, my.
Five to three. How did three people
vote democratic in a district...
that hasn't voted for a Democrat
since Roosevelt?
They're trying to send you a message.
This ain't gonna be a nice election...
folks talking about
the "amber waves of grain."
This is about the man with the money
against the woman with the name.
Can't beat you on your record.
You haven't got one.
And he won't beat you on the issues.
On the issues, I'll kick his ass.
The real question is:
Can you beat Shirley Magnuson?
I'm not running against
Shirley Magnuson.
Whatever you don't want to see
in the papers...
whatever you and your husband haven't
told each other, Shirley will find it.
Shirley's wasting her time.
- How's your marriage?
- Swell. How's yours?
If I was running for office,
I'd be in trouble.
You fool around, Mrs. Chandler?
A little "slap and tickle"?
Any special friends?
Not at the moment,
but I'll keep you posted.
- What's the worst thing you've done?
- You need a life.
God, for a moment, I thought
we weren't gonna have any fun at all.
Got to grease all them people,
else they shut you down !
I didn't take a dime from you,
you crazy old bastard.
Marvin, we don't come up soon,
they're gonna come down and get us.
What you think they do about me?
For sure you'll pay a fine
for pouring liquor without a license.
But I need you to testify
against George.
You've got some leverage.
Want to make your situation worse?
Just keep thinking
what you're thinking.
You pay a little fine,
plead to disorderly.
But you gotta promise me
you're gonna show up against George.
I've gotta have that shotgun, now.
You're a good man.
Go on up.
Alcee, Marvin's coming up.
Get him downtown.
Take real good care of him.
Were you really gonna shoot
that old man?
He had that shotgun
pointed right at me.
What were you thinking
you'd do about me?
I figured he'd shoot you.
And I'd shoot him,
get myself a medal.
You'd be dead.
You've got a right
to remain silent, Officer. Use it.
<i>Ninety-five passengers and crew members</i>
<i>are feared lost.</i>
<i>Navy divers were expected to work</i>
<i>throughout the night.</i>
<i>Will Thomas, are you there?</i>
<i>Over my shoulder, they have a crane</i>
<i>hoisting the plane out of the water</i>.
<i>We've got divers in the water.</i>
Where's Peyton?
Working late.
You gonna eat?
We've got bay scallops.
I'll see if I can find her.
<i>The plane struck the surface</i>
<i>at a shallow angle...</i>
<i>and bounced at least one time before</i>
<i>plowing into the water, nose first.</i>
I'm at Billy's.
I'll call you at home.
If we don't catch up, I'll eat here.
He's got bay scallops.
Love you. Bye.
<i>It's the Van Den Broecks'.</i>
<i>Leave a message and we'll call you back.</i>
<i>To play back your messages, press one.</i>
<i>Hi. I'm at the airport.</i>
<i>The first time I send a catalog to Miami</i>
<i>without me, and it's falling apart</i>.
<i>The new stylist locations don't work,</i>
<i>bugs biting the girls.</i>
<i>You don't want to know what else.</i>
<i>Therefore, I am on the plane</i>
<i>to kill critters and counsel careers.</i>
<i>I'll try to get back tomorrow,</i>
<i>but it may not be till Sunday.</i>
<i>God knows where I'll sleep.</i>
<i>They're in the Keys someplace.</i>
<i>I'll call you when I can.</i>
<i>I had fun this morning.</i>
<i>I love you.</i>
Find her?
- That plane was going to Miami?
- Yeah.
Give me some quarters.
I once got laid in Miami.
My name's Van Den Broeck.
I'm a Washington D.C. police officer
if that makes any difference.
You get lots of crazies when something
like this happens. That's why I say it.
I think it's possible my wife
may have been on your airplane.
Peyton Van Den Broeck.
Great. She must be on another flight.
Boy, that'll wake you up.
What are the other flights to Miami?
check the 1 :15, but it doesn't make
sense. She lett for the airport at 9:00.
Excuse me. I'm Bill Van Den Broeck,
Peyton's husband.
She went to Miami today.
I need to know what plane she was on.
I can be with you in a moment.
We don't have this in a six,
but I can order it for you.
I can try it in an eight.
Excuse me. I'm Bill Van Den Broeck,
Peyton's husband.
She went to Miami today. I need
to find out what plane she was on.
- You're the policeman?
- That's right.
Mary Claire Clark books the travel,
but she goes home at 5:30.
Can you reach her at home?
Oh, my God. The plane that crashed.
I don't know. She's was going to Miami,
but they don't have her listed.
Molly, how do we get ahold
of Mary Claire Clark?
Excuse me.
Must you shout?
Peyton was going to Miami.
She might be on the plane that crashed.
We have to find out
what flight she was on.
Does anyone know what Mary Claire Clark
was doing tonight?
Call the switchboard.
Get her number at home.
The airline won't tell you?
They don't have her listed on the
flight. She's not listed on any flight.
I know she was going. She left me
a message at work and at home.
They can't give out home numbers.
This is Molly Roll. Who's this?
Hi, Carla.
I need your help.
I'm supervisor in Designer Wear. Confirm
that by calling back extension 293.
I need the home telephone number
of Mary Claire Clark.
She's the department secretary.
We are managing an emergency.
Do you understand? Thank you.
You must be Dutch. I'm Molly.
What was she doing in Miami?
Sounded like some kind of crisis.
You're shooting something, catalog,
in the Keys that was falling apart?
What would we be shooting in the Keys?
- Did she say which catalog?
- No.
Thank you.
Sarah, would you get her for me?
I'm going to get my boss.
What catalog?
- What happened to Peyton?
- I didn't know we were doing a catalog.
Susan, are you working?
Peyton didn't know she was going.
We had a dinner date.
There's no answer.
She went directly to the airport.
Somebody must've called her.
Would she call Mary Claire for
a reservation or use a travel agent?
This is Mr. Driker, Vice President
of Designer Wear. He's our boss.
- Would you excuse us, please?
- Sure.
- Is Peyton on that plane?
- We don't know.
- Either way, she's toast.
- Just zip it.
We don't have a catalog shooting
in Florida or anywhere else.
The next catalog's not till Christmas.
Maybe it's not a catalog.
Something involving models.
The girls are getting bit by bugs.
No, there's nothing like that.
If Peyton's traveling,
I don't think it's for the store.
I know when our people are out of town.
I have to approve it...
and we're stingy on travel.
Are you saying she lied to me?
I'm saying I don't know where she is.
I'm trying to think of something
I can do. I would like to be helpful.
There was this judge someplace
who had two whole, entire families.
Kids, dogs, everything.
A judge.
We think we know. We don't know.
Nobody knows.
You just don't know.
Oh, my God.
Maybe she was traveling
as someone's wife.
If anyone knows what his name is,
I could check that plane.
I don't know, honestly.
Beats me. She seemed--
She never looked like she was looking.
Like girls look
if they're looking. Okay?
Mr. Van Den Broeck...
I think I know Peyton
as well as anyone here.
- I've got no idea.
- Are you surprised?
The important thing is, we don't know
if she was on the plane or not.
I think she was on the plane.
Jessie, tell me the truth.
Are kids drinking at these parties?
I invented some of the excuses
you're giving me.
I've been 15.
You've never been 35.
Okay, 37.
I'll see for myself Wednesday.
<i>Identification is the responsibility</i>
<i>of the County Coroner.</i>
5'6", 120.
Blue eyes.
A wedding band, plain.
A diamond ring, emerald cut,
about a carat.
I'm telling you,
she was on your airplane!
If I'm wrong, great!
If I'm right, you know who to call !
- Can I have some empty boxes?
- Ask the guy out back.
- Excuse me. Are you Mr. Van Den Broeck?
- Yeah.
I'm David Dotson. This is
Phyllis Bonaparte, Southern Airlines.
Do you have a minute to talk to us?
Sure.
We don't show your wife as anybody's
passenger on any flight to Miami.
<i>Hi. I'm at the airport.</i>
<i>The first time I send a catalog to Miami</i>
w<i>ithout me, and it's falling apart</i>.
<i>The new stylist locations don't work,</i>
<i>bugs biting the girls.</i>
<i>You don't want to know what else.</i>
<i>Therefore,</i>
<i>I am on the plane to kill--</i>
No one named Van Den Broeck made a
reservation or bought a ticket to Miami.
There is no catalog shoot.
She works for Saks.
They don't know where she is.
I think she was gonna spend the weekend
in Miami. I assume with another guy.
If she was, would she tell the truth
about her destination?
The trick is not to lie
any more than you have to.
- You got a passenger list?
- I'm not supposed to let you see it.
I figure the guy bought the tickets
Mr. and Mrs.
But I think he's married.
Be interesting when you call his house.
- I'm not allowed--
- Let him see the list.
- I need that back.
- They'll give you another one.
There's a Royal Regency Hotel
near where the plane went down.
We have rooms for family members.
Why don't you drive down with us?
You'll have to be there to identify--
To make the identification.
Sit around with the next of kin?
I don't think so. I've got things to do.
Mr. Van Den Broeck, I don't think
you should be alone right now.
Oh, yeah?
I was alone before you got here.
<i>Everybody, listen up. We got a guy</i>
<i>thinks his wife was on 437...</i>
traveling with another man
on Mr. and Mrs. tickets.
The guy's a D.C. cop.
As far as we know, he's not nuts.
Who the wife's boyfriend is,
he hasn't got a clue.
We got nine M and M's on the manifest.
Another two pair sitting together,
same last name.
Married, cousins, who knows.
Be careful.
Do not assume a deceased Mrs.
is for real.
We've got two problems.
We don't want to tell some widow
her husband died happy.
And we don't want to tell the kids Mom's
gone when Mom's asleep in Bethesda.
What does your sex life have to do
with saving Social Security?
Tell me that.
According to Shirley Magnuson,
everything.
What is the worst thing
you've ever done?
If I've already done it,
it's gonna be a real dull life.
You're gonna be a big disappointment
to ol' Shirley.
Think Cullen's the last man
you'll ever sleep with?
Wendy!
College was best.
All that stuff going on.
When's he gonna call?
When's he gonna kiss me?
At night,
when I bring it back...
I get that ache
all over again.
I'm gonna tell Richard
we'd better host a fund-raiser.
Come over tonight, both of you.
We can make a guest list.
He's in New York.
What the hell you doing here
on Saturday?
George and Clayton made bond.
You know this ain't the best case
we ever made.
Got Clayton's statement.
Did you read him his rights?
He'll say I didn't.
We got Marvin.
Something wrong with you?
What's wrong?
<i>Dick?</i>
Dick? Sorry.
3A and B. Mr. and Mrs. Cullen Chandler.
No one's called.
There's an unlisted number for
Cullen Chandler at the Metropolitan.
And you ready for this?
Doorman says Mrs. Chandler
is a congresswoman.
And he saw her today.
She was going jogging.
<i>When I was small,</i>
<i>I knew my father was in politics...</i>
<i>but I didn't know what that was</i>
<i>or why he had to go to Washington</i>.
Let's make it "my dad"...
instead of "father"
to warm it up a little.
Dad. Right. Okay.
Kay Chandler, take three.
Hello. I'm Kay Chandler
and I'm running for Congress.
When I was small,
I knew my dad was in politics--
Maybe it should be "kid."
"When I was a kid."
"When I was just a kid."
How about that?
When I was a kid.
Help you?
We need to speak to Mrs. Chandler.
- We're taping a spot here.
- It's all right. What is it?
Mrs. Chandler, I'm Dick Montoya.
This is Phyllis Bonaparte.
We're with Southern Airlines.
Is there somewhere we can talk?
About what?
I'm sorry to have to tell you.
Your husband was on our flight
to Miami yesterday.
What?
The one that--
Cullen's in New York.
I wish that were so, ma'am.
You do fly to New York,
don't you?
Not from Washington, no, ma'am.
I'm afraid the identification
is correct.
I'm awfully sorry.
He said he was going to New York.
Why would he go to Miami?
The identification is correct.
We have his wallet.
I'm very sorry.
Mrs. Chandler, if something did happen
to your husband...
it'll lead the news tonight
in New Hampshire.
Where's your daughter?
We have a daughter.
She's 15.
We won't release the casualty list
till all the families are notified.
But we need your help
identifying your husband.
- Where is he?
- Patuxent Naval Air Station.
- I have to get home.
- I understand. Let us help.
Call Dick Taradisian at the White House.
Tell him what the deal is.
Ask him if there's any possible way
to get a plane to meet us at Patuxent.
If the Air Force can't do it,
call G. M. or anybody who's got a jet.
He did say Miami.
Usually it's New York,
but this time he said Miami.
Mr. Van Den Broeck,
we have a car for you.
Mom, what are you doing home?
Where's Dad?
Thou anointest my head
with oil.
<i>My cup runneth over.</i>
<i>Surely goodness and mercy</i>
<i>shall follow me...</i>
all the days of my life.
And I will dwell
in the House of the Lord forever.
Let us pray.
Almighty God...
Father of mercies
and Giver of all comfort--
<i>I met this guy because he was</i>
<i>smart enough to get out of the rain.</i>
<i>I was too.</i>
So we waited under the arch
until it was over.
And then he asked me
if I knew where the bookstore was.
And I said I happened
to be going there myself.
Which was a lie of course, but--
We had so many great days.
Just not enough years.
But we had his love.
I'll call you later.
Excuse me.
Are you Mary Claire Clark?
Yes. I am sorry.
Name Cullen Chandler
mean anything to you?
If I'd called my wife at work
that morning, what would you have said?
That she called in and said
she was taking the day off.
But you wouldn't have gotten me.
She sent me to shop Tyson's Corners...
and told me I could go home from there.
I would've gotten her voice mail?
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
- Mr. Van Den Broeck?
- Yes.
I have some of her personal things.
I could drop them off.
I'll take them now.
I know. I've just gotta get out of here.
I'll take Jess with me.
Kay, it's gonna look like--
I don't care.
Just get us back to Washington.
I can't see all these people.
It's like going through--
Don't make a mistake now,
Mrs. Chandler.
Everybody's watching.
Just one more day.
<i>How can I find out if a guy was on</i>
<i>one of your flights to Miami in May?</i>
Hello.
My name is Bill Van Den Broeck.
- Yes. You said you were a policeman.
- Yeah, I am.
But I'm not working right now.
What is this about?
My wife was on that plane
that your husband was on.
I'm sorry.
I wonder if I could have a few minutes.
I just got home.
This isn't a good time for me.
For me, either.
So you're visiting survivors?
You're the only one.
I'd ask you to s--
I don't understand.
My daughter's due back any minute.
Do you have kids?
Jessica is 15.
Is there something
you want to know, Mr.--
I'm sorry.
I forgot your name.
It's Van Den Broeck.
No, I--
I just thought--
I'm so sorry.
It's really--
It's unspeakable.
Unspeakable.
You seem okay.
Do I?
Paper said your husband was a lawyer
in New Hampshire.
He has an office here.
Most of his work was here.
And I'm in Congress.
Yeah, I know.
Why was he going to Miami?
Business.
He had business there.
Are you investigating something?
They were sitting together
on the plane.
Your husband, my wife.
Did you know that?
3A and B.
First class.
First class isn't what it used to be.
It isn't worth the money.
Is there anything else?
You mad at me?
I don't know you, Lieutenant.
Why would I be mad at you?
I'm a sergeant.
What are you, a sophisticator?
That's my daughter.
Sorry.
An airline guy
left Dad's things downstairs...
so I brought them up.
This is my daughter Jessica.
- This is Sergeant--
- Van Den Broeck.
They call me Dutch.
It's easier.
He lost his wife on the plane.
Oh. I'm sorry.
I've never been to New Hampshire.
You go to school there or here?
I go to Andover.
It's a prep school.
I won't take any more of your time.
- Sorry about your dad.
- Thanks.
Nice to meet you.
I need an hour.
It's not a lot to ask.
Don't come here again.
They must've had them cleaned.
I'm sure it's for your birthday.
Dad said he was gonna get you
something great.
Expensive.
He'd knew I'd say no.
Mom...
I know you're worried about me,
but I still want you to run.
I'll be fine.
I don't want us to sit around
and be depressed.
I'm going back to school tomorrow.
All my friends are there,
and it's only 40 miles.
So I can come home on weekends
if I want.
Somebody popped Marvin.
Jesus Christ!
Shit!
George Beaufort did this.
Find anything else in here?
This a bad time?
I don't need to go through
all that garbage.
My case is gonna get kicked 'cause
somebody killed my only witness.
- Now get in there and do it!
- Easy.
- The last pickup was a week ago.
- It hasn't been that long.
Sure smells long.
- Sheila, what are you doing here?
- That ain't even my name.
Let's talk to these people.
You take that side, I'll take this side.
It's Homicide's. We're off it.
The hell we are.
I will not allow you--
I don't have any choice.
I need your help.
Before you dropped by to tell me
my husband was screwing your wife...
did you think that might be
a hurtful thing to do?
You knew already.
Suppose I didn't.
How did you know?
He told me he was going to New York.
He was on the wrong plane, so it must
be another woman? Just like that?
It could've been amnesia.
My wife was in Miami in February
and May. Was your husband?
What difference does it make?
It's entirely over.
He's through with her,
she's through with him.
And we're through with both of them.
We can't even get a divorce.
You can do that.
I have a child.
I try and go back in my head.
What's the last thing you remember about
you and your husband you know is true?
I gotta find out how far back
I have to go to do that.
This is where they were gonna stay.
- I've got work to do.
- Don't you want to know how it started?
How long it was going on?
You don't want to know what their plans
were? You don't want to know anything?
What she thought about
when she thought about me.
I'd like to know that.
I thought you might like to know
what she looked like.
You leave me alone.
I mean it.
Thirty.
Take a number and have a seat.
Alice Beaufort?
George Beaufort's wife?
Is he all right?
He's fine.
I'm Sergeant Van Den Broeck.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
- He was with me.
- What time was that?
Anytime you're talking about.
Thirty-one.
You got an envelope.
February was swimsuits,
and May was fall fashion.
You saw those catalogs?
Yes, Dutch, I saw the catalogs.
I told you twice. I'll get them for you.
How do we know she shot those books
in Miami? What if she just said--
Because there were palm trees,
a beach and a very big ocean.
If she doesn't run, she's crazy.
Tell him.
Just a sympathy bounce, but she's up
14 points since the funeral.
I think she'll stay in,
but she'll need some time.
She's a brave widow,
she's got this kid.
- They're eating it up.
- You're hard.
She knows.
I know she knows.
Maybe he was buying a boat.
Maybe it was drugs or government work.
Why are you so determined
it's another woman?
Why are you protecting him?
If you know who it is, I swear to God--
What's your thought? I lied the first
five times, and now I'm gonna cave?
Why is this so important to you?
I caught Sam with a woman once.
I spilled a milkshake on my skirt,
so I ran home from lunch.
I heard them in the shower.
At first I thought it was the radio.
But what she was saying,
you don't hear on the radio.
I ran.
I couldn't go back to work.
For hours, literally...
I didn't remember that I was involved
with someone else.
I had been for months.
And I liked my life with Sam.
Things were fine.
What'd you do?
I kept my mouth shut...
and I never went home again
without calling first.
To say that involvement--
I don't mean casual sex,
I mean romance.
To say that that whole part of life,
half the fun of life has to end...
if you told me
that had to be over...
I'd feel old.
If you had known about Peyton,
would you tell me?
Now, I mean.
I am going to run to the ladies' room.
Get me another one.
Broman's over there, dreaming up ways
to remind you of my loss.
A detective came by the office today
asking about Cullen.
I wasn't there. Barry said he asked
how much Cullen traveled.
He seemed to be particularly interested
in Miami, who our Miami clients were.
Said he was going there tomorrow.
Is this anything I should know about?
I have no idea.
I'm sorry, you're right.
It's too soon.
I wanna go home.
- Wait till Wendy--
- I'll get a cab. Tell Wendy I'm sorry.
<i>Leave a message</i>.
<i>I'll call you back.</i>
Mr. Van Den Broeck?
Hi.
I'm so sorry about Peyton.
Come. We have a coffee.
February we shoot in the studios.
May, the Keys,
to get away from tourists.
Why come to Miami twice in a row?
Why not go somewhere else?
I would like to think
it was my work, but--
I suspect so she can
walk the city and sketch.
She loved the streets, the markets.
The Latin music.
Was there a man?
I don't think there is a man, no.
What about after work?
What did she do after work?
More walking.
Sometimes the clubs,
for music and to watch the dancing.
You know who she went with?
If I can say...
if you want to be with a woman,
these shoots are not so good for that.
Did you ever sleep with Peyton?
Your situation is very difficult.
I excuse the question.
I wonder if I could talk to somebody
in your security department.
Is there someplace we can talk?
Stoli, please, on the rocks.
I'm from a little town
in a little state.
And unfortunately, I'm in Congress
so when you interview people...
it's easy to start talk.
They might even stumble on the truth.
You can't want that.
- I only want to talk to you.
- I don't know anything!
What do you want to know?
- How long it was going on.
- So we know how stupid to feel?
- How they met. Their plans.
- I can't help you.
- At least you tried.
- Are you trying to be funny?
No. Not anymore.
Don't you fuck with me!
If you don't like that word,
don't use it.
Do you know what happens when a member
of Congress accuses you of harassment?
We get our names in the newspapers.
- That's very close to blackmail.
- I'm not a lawyer.
And I'm not some investigation.
You can't rummage through my life.
Who's next on your list?
My neighbors, my staff, my friends?
- Then talk to me.
- So you can paw through my marriage?
Make me confess to something?
It's my life, mine to judge, not yours.
- You're not the only one involved.
- Look!
If they find out about your wife,
it's gossip.
If they find out about my husband,
it's in the newspapers.
I have a daughter who adores her father,
who doesn't know.
What do I tell her?
I don't know.
Come on.
Let me show you something.
Nice, huh?
I figure they would've
had drinks here.
- Want to see their room?
- No!
- They never got here.
- Not this time, anyway.
She stayed here February 19.
Also May 14 on business.
If he was with her,
he didn't register.
Did your husband like Latin stuff?
Music, dancing?
Why?
He had the concierge book him a table
at someplace called La Roca.
Cullen liked classical music.
You sure?
- What?
- Nothing.
You know what I do for a living.
I get paid to notice stuff.
I get paid to know who's lying.
I didn't have a clue.
Missed it.
I thought we were happy.
Not giddy.
Not ecstatic.
We weren't unhappy.
I wasn't.
I was pretty happy.
I don't want to be here.
That's Kay Chandler.
Hi. Peter Suchet. East Concord.
Voted for your dad.
Do you mind?
Honey, take another picture.
- They took our picture.
- Do you know them?
They're from Concord.
They took our picture!
I bury my husband
and go nightclubbing in Miami.
Stay here.
- Where are you going?
- To get the film.
God no! You can't just mug some guy.
It'll make things worse.
You are a cop.
Is that gonna be trouble for you?
What'd we look like?
We looked like--
You had your hand on my shoulder.
You don't care who knows, do you?
About her and him, I mean.
I care.
They know anyway.
Sooner or later,
everybody knows everything.
What time is it?
My plane's at 9:30.
Little after 8:00.
Sure you don't wanna stay over?
Yes.
Maybe we should split up.
We should've stayed.
I'm in restricted parking.
I took the Metro.
It's not running now.
- I'll get a cab.
- Where do you live?
- Northwest. It's out of your way.
- Do you want me to drop you or not?
You know where we're going.
Why? Stayed why?
Why? Because they did?
Because they were going to?
God! Easy!
Goddamn it! Stop it!
Stop it now!
Well, that was fun.
Don't!
Just drive.
Unbelievable.
- You want to come in or--
- Don't be ridiculous!
<i>Pick up the phone,</i>
<i>you son of a bitch!</i>
<i>You like scaring women?</i>
<i>You come around my wife</i>
<i>one more time, and-</i>-
<i>No, no. You come</i>
<i>and try to scare me, asshole!</i>
<i>Chickenshit!</i>
<i>10:52 p.m.</i>
<i>End of messages.</i>
<i>Last number called: 555-4421.</i>
<i>Press 1 to connect.</i>
<i>Parkway Lanes.</i>
Is George Beaufort still there?
Hold on, man.
What the hell you--
Whoa! Back it up!
Knock it off!
Take it outside!
Get off me!
Son of a bitch!
Come on !
Somebody call the police!
I have your badge now, baby.
You better get a lawyer.
George killed that man.
Goddamn it.
You can't go around beating up suspects.
You're suspended.
There's gonna be a trial board. You
assaulted a man. You can lose your job.
How tough would it be if somebody swears
they saw George at that Dumpster?
I was thinking,
if you went to see the shrink--
It wouldn't cost nothing.
Talk about Peyton. It could help.
I don't need to talk about Peyton.
I could tell 'em you got stressed out
on the job. It wouldn't be a lie!
Honk if you're screwin' him.
We could save a plane ticket.
Where'd you get that?
Shirley Magnuson.
Says she thinks it's phony.
Says I'm settin' her up.
Setting her up?
I take the picture, make sure
it gets slipped to her, she uses it.
I provide a perfectly innocent
explanation. Ta-da!
- Her candidate's a mudslinger.
- My God, you people!
Pretty good idea.
I wish I had had it.
If you have to explain that picture,
can you do it?
Yes.
Jessie!
- Where's your bracelet?
- It's around.
You didn't lose it.
It's around.
What's the matter?
It's not my bracelet.
What?
Dad didn't have any clients
in Miami, did he?
He was with that cop's wife, huh?
What was going on?
Something.
I'm not sure what.
Were they serious?
That would be my guess.
Do a lot of people know?
<i>Leave a message</i>.
<i>I'll call you back.</i>
It's me.
<i>Remember? From restricted parking?</i>
<i>So you picked Peyton.</i>
<i>And Cullen picked Peyton.</i>
That's two-zip against the home team.
<i>"Have we been introduced?"...</i>
she says, straightening her clothes.
<i>I thought I should introduce myself,</i>
<i>and fill you in on my plans.</i>
<i>I'm packing it in.</i>
No. That sounds like suicide.
All I mean is, like you said, sooner
or later everybody knows everything.
<i>This will be in the papers.</i>
<i>I can't handle that.</i>
I can't let Jessica be mowed down...
by gossip she had nothing to do with.
But if I'm not in Congress,
if I'm out...
it's not news anymore.
She's safe.
<i>You know?</i>
You do know, don't you?
You're the only one who does.
I miss that.
Hey, do me a favor.
<i>Erase this</i>.
<i>God, I'm glad you're not there!</i>
Kay?
She's getting a lot of points
for showing up.
- How are you doing?
- Fine, how are you?
Excuse me.
My contribution.
If you quit, they win.
And the crash got us all.
Don't let them do that.
I'm not the only one involved.
She should know her mom's no quitter.
I just want to say how impressed I am
that you're staying in.
I have to say a few things.
The name of this group
is Friends of Kay Chandler.
I'm sorry about that phone call.
We're not getting much sleep, are we?
- I'm afraid of what's playing.
- Me too.
Might give it a try.
Turn in around 3:00.
Cullen would be so proud of you.
I know you know.
I don't know how many times
I've introduced Kay Chandler.
There's a lot between 3:00 and 5:00.
Australian football.
May I present your friend...
your congresswoman...
Don't go away.
your next representative for
the second district of New Hampshire...
Kay Spencer-Chandler!
Thank you.
Thank you, Richard.
Thank you all.
It's good to be home.
I wanted to say just a word.
Just a few words.
You're all being very nice to me.
I don't want to disappoint you.
But I just don't want
to talk politics tonight.
I'm just glad to be home.
Richard and Wendy, thank you so much.
Thanks, all of you,
for your friendship, your support...
for showing up here tonight.
Thanks.
I mean it.
Don't anybody leave without me getting
a chance to talk to you, okay?
We love you, Kay.
Well done, Kay.
Very nice.
I want a chance to talk to you.
- You told me 15 times already.
- Do you have the number?
Sorry.
I wish I could get out of the party.
- No way.
- Some of these are $1,000 folks.
I just wish I didn't have to go.
It was good of you to come.
It was our party.
Kinda had to.
I appreciate it, that's all.
Thank you.
- Get a ticket?
- A road map.
Maybe someone thought
it fell out of my car.
Listen, time to commit.
All the way in or not?
If you're not gonna run, we need to
return that fund-raiser money quickly.
Maybe I'll take a day.
Do some thinking.
I'll be around.
I was wondering if you'd come.
A guy like you, a girl like me,
what reason could there be not to?
Sorry I'm late. I had to change
a few times and pack.
I thought if I packed real light,
it'd look like I knew what I was doing.
But then I didn't know
what I was doing...
so I didn't know what to pack.
Where are we exactly?
Chesapeake Bay's a couple miles
off that way.
I won't make small talk.
I don't want there to be any junk
between us.
No littering.
There's so many reasons
I might be doing this.
I kept thinking I'll go one more mile,
and then I'll...
turn around and--
I was thinking about your mouth.
Nobody knows who I am anymore.
Nobody knows how easily
I could do this.
I know who you are.
I have to know something.
Are you a democrat?
What if I am?
We'd talk.
I'd give you books to read.
I like it when there's just
the two of us.
Are you hungry?
I'm hungry.
No TV?
Is there a phone?
Not so far.
What's that like?
Quiet.
What is this? Do you know?
Heineken.
The start of something?
Yeah.
That's what I thought.
I want to know who is this woman
wearing my clothes...
and using my body.
Is she permanent?
Or is she only around
when you are?
I say we hide here for a couple of years
and make a run for the border.
I always thought
when I had my time in...
I'd like to live down here.
Start a little security service.
The raccoons are knocking over
the garbage cans?
A lot of Washington-Baltimore people
have places on the water here.
They always think
they're gonna get robbed.
You had plans.
I don't think we had any plans.
I always wanted a boat.
One you could sleep on.
We've got a boat. <i>Defense Rests.</i>
Get it?
I've got a boat.
I'll give it to you.
I don't trust this
any more than you do.
But you're the only thing that's real.
Let me ask you something tough.
Are you sorry the plane went down?
What are you doing?
Think about it.
You can have it all back
the way it was...
but you gotta take it all.
He's lying.
He's screwing another woman.
- Laughing at how easy we are to fool.
- Stop. Don't do that.
I'm done with them.
Done with them!
- The thing is--
- Stop.
Come on.
Let's go home.
You know those drugstore kits
that tell you when you're pregnant?
They should have one
that tells you when you're sane.
I think they had a place they'd meet.
An apartment makes sense.
How could it make sense?
No driving. No motels.
If they did, they did.
They're on their own.
This was in her desk at work.
Is that why you drew the map?
Is that why you came to Concord?
I came to Concord
'cause I didn't want you to quit.
- People have keys.
- Did you see one like this?
- No!
- In his luggage maybe?
So they had a place.
They're not there anymore!
And I don't care.
I just don't care!
Then maybe you didn't lose that much.
Or you're lying to yourself.
The sun's going down.
It's time to go.
When will you be back?
The roof's got a leak.
I've got time...
so thought I'd try
and make it worse.
Maybe we'll never get clear
the way we met...
maybe we'll find we'll never be alone.
But I don't want us
to lose this chance.
If it's just gonna be about them,
if it's always gonna be four of us--
You be careful driving home.
Thanks for driving all the way
to Concord.
And for the contribution.
That was something.
And I don't even live in your district.
<i>You have one message.</i>
<i>It's me, Wendy.</i>
<i>Where have you been?</i>
<i>I have $50,000 from your friends</i>
<i>and neighbors, and nobody to give it to.</i>
<i>What do you wanna do?</i>
<i>Lunch tomorrow? Give me a call.</i>
Come on, Alcee!
Just get me a picture.
Head shot's okay.
Give me the photo from his I.D.
All right.
I'll call you when I get back.
I want Jessica out there, smiling like
Chelsea and keeping her mouth shut.
Her job is good kid, no opinions.
She can wear jeans.
No short-shorts, no bra tops.
No Jessica.
She's in school.
School? I thought we're trying
to win an election.
No Jessica.
I don't want her--
I think I may be losing
what it takes to lie.
- This may become a problem.
- Let's take a break.
I'm not liking this.
We're telling the whole southeast side
a police officer's a murder suspect.
You think George ain't gonna hear?
You're not supposed to be working!
That's why you're here.
Shyla, you in there?
Hello?
Anybody home?
Hey, Shyla, we need to talk a second.
Can we come in?
- No, you can't come in.
- You want to come out then?
You get outta here! Folks see I'm
talking to you, my ass is in trouble.
Goddamn it, Dutch!
Come on, man!
- You got no right in here!
- I ain't gonna hurt you.
Let's go. You got no warrant.
She's already said no.
If my brother was facing 15 months,
looking at one picture wouldn't hurt.
Seen this man before?
That's Big George.
I see him all over.
Did you see him in the alley
the night we found the body?
You didn't maybe see him dump the man in
the Dumpster? Maybe with somebody else?
Look again. Maybe it'll come back to
you. Any chance your brother'll get out?
That's it! You didn't see the man.
We're sorry to have disturbed you.
I want you out right now!
Out now!
What the hell's the matter with you?
Dutch, I'm sorry about your wife.
But you want George to come after you?
Is that it? So you can shoot him?
- You got tired of working cheap?
- What?
You know goddamn well he's guilty.
Why are you protecting him?
Is he paying you now?
Oh, man.
Here. I feel like a bagman.
There's cash in there
so be careful.
Well, guess what?
Cullen was having an affair.
Tru says the ahi tuna's
incredible here.
That's why he was going to Miami.
How long?
What's the difference?
Is being deaf, dumb and blind
a liability for a congresswoman?
I think he kept an apartment
that I don't know about.
- Would you like to hear our specials?
- Give us a minute, please.
I thought maybe...
Cullen had told Richard...
and Richard had said something.
Hey, come on!
It's only adultery.
Nobody gives a damn,
except the people it's happening to...
and it's not happening to you--
My God!
Oh, Kay, please give me
a chance to explain.
Shut up.
It didn't mean--
- I was always gonna tell you.
- Where is it?
It's been over a year.
I haven't been there.
Where is it?
The Colton Building on Rhode Island.
It's just stupid.
I'm not very hungry.
If you can get the check, please?
Stop, please.
Listen to me, because...
if we don't see you,
then Richard will know.
I can't keep seeing you so your husband
won't know you've been screwing mine.
Please.
I need to tell you
how rotten I feel.
Let me go.
- Hello?
<i>- Hello. It's me.</i>
<i>Bad time?</i>
How's the roof?
<i>Lousy.</i>
Is something wrong?
<i>Want to get something to eat?</i>
Sure. I'm not that hungry,
but I want to see you.
Everything all right?
Weren't you ever tempted
to cheat on Peyton?
Tempted? Yeah. Sure.
Why didn't you?
Maybe I did.
I don't think so.
I wonder how they got their laundry done
if they had a place.
You think this--
everything that happened...
you think it's...
made you different?
Different how?
More suspicious?
Maybe.
But here I am.
I'm leaving you tomorrow.
I knew we should've gone to McDonald's.
I have to try to get elected.
I lost a friend today...
being suspicious.
What happens if you don't get elected?
Country goes to hell.
And I go home...
for keeps.
But you're gonna beat this guy, right?
When I get back--
I'll be here.
I'll nail his ass!
Here you go.
Back Friday.
Wait a second.
You've got some dry cleaning.
Sorry.
<i>Saks Fifth Avenue.</i>
<i>- Employees entrance.</i>
<i>- I'll get him.</i>
Sorry.
- Ladies' room.
- Mary Claire?
Oh, yeah.
You wouldn't believe
all the keys I've got.
I've got a key to Vic Tanny's
in Rochester.
Keys to the ones in Westchester.
I don't think there was an apartment.
She was always here.
There wasn't time.
No, wait.
She gave me a phone number once.
She was on her way to a meeting.
Just a minute.
Yeah, this is it.
Yeah. In the bottom in pencil.
Go right ahead.
May I have a 911 supervisor, please?
This is Sergeant Van Den Broeck,
D.C. Internal Affairs. 9114.
I need an address please
for a telephone number.
How long did you know?
Did you know when you came to Miami?
No. How could you ever think--
When you came to my cabin,
did you know then?
I found out yesterday.
So you knew last night.
When were you gonna tell me?
I thought--
I thought maybe years from now...
when it's behind us.
What did you find?
Nothing.
Dutch, you weren't--
We had a pact.
Then what the hell
are you doing here?
I want to finish it.
I want it over.
That your purse?
What'd you find?
What did you find?
There's nothing here.
Oh, Christ!
I can smell her perfume.
Stop it, Dutch.
There's nothing here.
There's gotta be something left.
Some--
Some sign.
Stop it!
You'll never find
what you're looking for. Never!
You want to know why,
and there is no why.
Don't.
<i>In case you check in, I'm heading for</i>
<i>the airport early. Meet me for coffee.</i>
<i>Hi, it's me.</i>
<i>I'm running late.</i>
<i>There was something I needed to do.</i>
<i>If I'm not there, go without me</i>.
<i>I'll get the next plane and meet you.</i>
<i>What are we doing?</i>
<i>Do you know?</i>
We made love that morning.
That's why she was late.
Shit!
Get an ambulance!
Get out of the car!
Get out!
Help!
Kay Chandler.
Congresswoman from New Hampshire.
Police reports her husband was getting
it on with Van Den Broeck's wife.
Evidently a love shack.
You all right?
The press is out there,
and they know you're here.
They could get hungry
and go somewhere for a hamburger.
How we gonna handle this?
Handle it!
"Handle" is when you've got a client
who'll tell you what's going on!
We can assume they'll want to know how
well the congresswoman knows the cop.
- How are we gonna handle this?
- I don't know.
If we get back to New Hampshire
and let this age a day--
A back elevator will get us out
through the basement.
He's right.
What time is it?
Almost midnight.
Somebody stole my watch.
Where's Alcee?
He said he'd come by tomorrow.
I was trying to catch up with you.
What were you gonna say?
I don't know what I was gonna say.
I just--
I just didn't want you to leave,
not like that anyway.
Welcome back. Hungry?
Where's my watch?
They need you in X ray.
Listen.
I probably never would've told you
about the place, either.
All I wanted--
What I want really...
is just to find some way
to let her go...
and move on.
I don't know how you do that.
Neither do I.
It's not a crime.
You loved your wife.
And you still do.
All set. Let me see if I can find
a couple of orderlies.
Will you hang around?
I can't.
You're supposed to be nice to me.
I've been shot.
We did okay.
We did the best we could...
under the circumstances.
Ready, Sergeant?
It's time for you to go.
Me too.
Will that be all right?
So long, Kay.
Here she comes.
I've got to catch a plane,
but if you can make it short.
We've been told your husband was having
an affair with Van Den Broeck's wife.
That they had an apartment, and
that's where you were. Is that correct?
Yes, it is.
Could you characterize
your relationship with the sergeant?
Sergeant Van Den Broeck's wife
was killed on the plane with my husband.
I met the sergeant a few days
after that day.
He was a friend when I needed a friend.
I hope he feels the same way.
You're just friends?
Just friends.
We are surely friends.
We've seen each other through something.
We're more than friends,
we're survivors.
Now, you'll have to excuse me.
I really have to get home.
Can you tell us anything more
of the sergeant's condition?
Is he responsive?
Bye, Mom.
Bye, Mrs. Chandler.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Do I know you?
I'm Ted Baker.
I work for Mr. Cornelius.
You said we could--
Yeah, sure.
Make yourselves at home.
Hello, Kay.
Hi, Sergeant.
Lieutenant.
They made me a lieutenant.
All I had to do was get shot.
Can I get you something?
Stoli on the rocks.
I haven't had one of those
in a while.
I've got a plane.
I don't have time.
What's with those New Hampshire voters?
They crazy or what?
I think they could tell
I didn't want the job.
Or maybe I wanted the job, I didn't want
to do what you have to do to get it.
- So you're out of work.
- I guess I am.
Are you as well as you look?
Leg's a little stiff.
But I think I'm gonna be okay.
You?
How's that football in Australia?
I tune in once in a while.
Not like before.
I was a real fan.
I gotta tell you something.
I thought I might run into you here.
Where are you going?
That's the thing. Nowhere.
I called your office
and they said you were headed home.
My flight's overbooked.
Go later.
Take another plane.
Come on.
It's my Christmas present,
running into you.
What'd you get me?
How 'bout I call you up sometime
in New Hampshire?
And say what?
Say, "You wanna go to a movie?"
What do you say?
Wouldn't that be something?
