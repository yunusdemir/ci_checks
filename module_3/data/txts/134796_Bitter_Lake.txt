Increasingly, we live in a world
where nothing makes any sense.
Events come and go like waves of a
fever,
leaving us confused and uncertain.
Those in power tell stories to help
us make sense
of the complexity of reality.
But those stories are increasingly
unconvincing and hollow.
# Excuse me, I'm lost... #
This is a film about why those
stories have stopped making sense.
And how that led us in the West to
become a dangerous and destructive
force in the world.
It is told
through the prism of a country
at the centre of the world.
Afghanistan.

In 1946, American engineers, along
with their wives and families,
began to arrive at a dusty
airstrip in Helmand
in southern Afghanistan.
They worked for the
biggest construction company
in the world - called Morrison
Knudsen -
and the King of Afghanistan had
brought them there
to build a giant planned new world -
a complex of dams, canals, roads,
and even a new model city.
The king's aim was to harness
the power of the giant Helmand river
and turn his country into a modern
society - just like in the West.
ARCHIVE: 'The Asiatic kingdom
of Afghanistan is located
'roughly 10,000 miles from either
coastline of the United States.
'Almost directly on the opposite side
of the globe, westward from China,
'beyond the Himalayas.
'It is a landlocked country, bordered
on the north by the Soviet Union,
'and on the east by Pakistan,
and on the west by Iran.'
The King was called Zahir Shah, and
he often came to visit the project.
Afghanistan was a deeply
conservative country and he was
determined to modernise it.
What the King was trying to create
in Helmand was a copy of what
President Roosevelt had done in
America in the 1930s.
And the company
he had hired - Morrison Knudsen -
had worked back
then for Roosevelt,
building a new world of dams and
power stations across America.
Now they were going
to do the same for Afghanistan.
The engineers and their families
lived in a complex of houses
around the King's country palace
in Helmand.
It became known as Little America.

At the end of the Second World War,
President Roosevelt travelled to
the Great Bitter Lake
in the middle of the Suez Canal.
At the same time, he sent
another American warship
to pick up the King of Saudi Arabia,
King Abdulaziz.
The meeting of King and President was
to have powerful - and disastrous -
consequences both for the West and,
in a strange way, for Afghanistan.
Roosevelt was dying,
but over the last 13 years
he had used his power on an epic
scale to transform the world.
After the Wall Street crash and the
terrible depression that followed,
Roosevelt had taken charge.
He had passed laws that broke up
the banks
so they would never run out
of control again.
And he had rebuilt
America with a series of giant dams
that brought electrical power and
employment to millions of people.
And he had planned and fought a
world war against Germany and Japan.
Now, as Roosevelt sat waiting for
Abdulaziz,
no-one could possibly have imagined
the consequences of this meeting.
For it was going to
unleash forces that in the future
would undermine everything that
Roosevelt had worked for -
his belief that politicians should
use their power in a planned way
to reshape the world.
But Roosevelt knew that to keep that
power, America needed oil.
And he wanted to forge an alliance
with the King to make sure
the vast Saudi oilfields remained
under American control.
In their conversation, the two men
laid the foundations for an alliance
that continues to the present day.
America would get its oil - and in
return, Saudi Arabia would receive
wealth and security from America.
But the King was well aware of the
dangers of opening up his country
to the influence of the modern West.
And in the negotiations that
followed, he laid down a condition.
We will take your technology
and your money, he said -
but you must
leave our faith alone.
The Saudi faith was called Wahhabism.
It was a radical, violent and
extremely puritanical form of Islam,
and its followers among the Bedouin
tribes hated the modern world.
Wahhabism was part of a wider
movement in Islam
that had risen up
in reaction to the European empires.
Another was the Deobandi movement
in India.
They all believed that modern
imperialism was corrupting
the true nature of Islam,
and wanted to go back to a world
based on the original teachings
of the Islamic texts.
Abdulaziz had harnessed this force
in the 1920s to seize power.
But he had unleashed something that
didn't want to stop.
The Wahhabists wanted to go on
and create a caliphate
across the whole of the Arab world -
and to stop them, in 1929,
Abdulaziz machine-gunned them.
He ruthlessly killed the warriors
who had made him King.
But their belief - a violent,
intolerant and, above all,
backward-looking version of Islam -
remained at the heart of
Saudi Arabian society.
And the deal made that day on
the Great Bitter Lake
meant that America would get
its oil
but it would also be protecting
Wahhabism -
a force that
had its own global ambitions.
Ambitions that were very
different from America's.

we could well do without.
By the mid-1950s,
the American engineers had built
the giant dams that were going to
create what they called
"a new wonderland of vegetation
and power" in Helmand.
But the project was running into
problems
and it was beginning
to lose its innocence.
As the giant dams were completed,
they had an unexpected effect.
They raised the
level of the water table
and started to bring salt
to the surface.
And one of the plants that thrived
in this new soil were poppies.
Some of those leading the project
said they should stop.
But the American government stepped
in and insisted that they should
continue because by now the dams
had become a central part
of the struggle with
the Soviet Union.
All sides in the Cold War began to
compete to offer Afghanistan
bigger and better schemes to
modernise the country.
Afghan politicians exploited
this ruthlessly.
The Prime Minister, Mohammed Daoud,
spent his time travelling the world
playing the countries - Russia,
America and China -
off against each other.
Daoud wanted to use the modernization
as a way of consolidating his power.
Afghanistan was a fragmented country.
Power was divided between
ethnic groups and tribes.
Daoud was a Pashtun and he saw how
the dam project in Helmand
could be used to consolidate the
Pashtun grip on the whole country.
He persuaded the Americans to make
the project even bigger,
to turn it into a giant piece of
social engineering.
Thousands of Pashtun nomads,
who spent their time roaming
the border area with Pakistan,
would be settled in the new farmland
created by the dams.
Daoud presented it as just another
innocent piece of modernisation -
and the Americans happily agreed.
What they didn't realise was that
they were unwittingly being sucked
into Afghan power politics.
Not only was Daoud increasing
Pashtun power, but he
was sowing the seeds of bitter
rivalries
over the division and
ownership of land in Helmand.

The British Board of Trade,
in the booklet it gives out to
visiting British businessmen,
does try to be helpful, but this
is what it says about Arabic time,
and that's only one of them.
"Sunset is taken as zero,
when watches are set to 12.
"A business appointment given for,
say, two o'clock in the evening
"will therefore be
for two hours after sunset
"and for five o'clock in the morning,
seven hours before sunset.
"It's important to remember
that sunset should be regarded
"as midnight. The time
of sunrise is irrelevant."
I don't know about you but I know
sun time is roughly six hours, uh...
plus five, in other words it's either
11 o'clock, morning or evening.
- But which?
- Well, it's 11 o'clock.
But it must have some relevance
to the time of day.
- Yes.
- How do you, as a businessman,
make appointments?
Um... I normally
make them by my watch.
I ask them personally whether they
are conforming to either Arabic time,
sun time or GMT plus three.
They normally say the other two.
I ask them to give me
a time at GMT plus three.
Now, sun time is six hours
after this, roughly.
Six hours after that?
Six hours plus five,
give or take an hour.
Do you know what time it is now?
Not really!
In 1964, King Faisal became
the new leader of Saudi Arabia.
Faisal set out
to modernise the country.
He created western-style
bureaucracies and a welfare system.
He even allowed television
for the first time.
But he faced two threats.
One was from the religious leaders
inside Saudi Arabia.
They were the Wahhabists, who had
brought his family to power
and gave his rule legitimacy.
They distrusted any idea
of modernising Saudi society.
Faisal was also facing
a dangerous situation abroad,
from communism, that was spreading
through the Arab world.
His solution was simple.
Faisal decided to use the religious
leaders and their conservative
beliefs as a force to counter the
international threat of communism.
But he knew that this would also
divert their attention
away from his domestic policies.
Faisal used the growing oil money
to set up hundreds of schools and
institutes across the Islamic world -
some as far away as Pakistan.
Their job was to spread Wahhabist
ideas and help to turn Islam into
a unified international force strong
enough to stand up to communism.
What Faisal was doing
was taking the dangerous
and unstable fanaticism
at the heart of Saudi society
and directing it outwards,
beyond its borders.
It was a ruthless way of creating
stability in his own country.
America gave this tacit approval
because it was part of the global
struggle against communism.
But in 1966, Faisal gave America
a glimpse of how uncontrollable
an ally Saudi Arabia could be.
He went to New York
and publicly attacked
America's support for Israel.
It caused an outrage.
HE SPEAKS IN ARABIC

the Jews throughout the world
support Israel.

DOG BARKS
The other day, a friend
of Blue Peter's, Angela Mulliner,
invited me to help her groom some
dogs with very shaggy coats indeed,
a pair of Afghan hounds.
This should be a good spot.
'You need plenty of space
to groom dogs this size,
'so we picked the park.
'Their names were Kingsley and Cleo
and I said I'd do Cleo.'
How often is one supposed to do this?
- Very frequently.
- Oh, gosh.
Don't sit down, Cleo,
there's a good girl.
'Angela and I wanted the dogs
to look their very best
'because we were taking them out
on a special assignment.
'We were all going off to The Mall
'and we had to be there
by 12 o'clock.'
- Come on, then, dogs.
- Come on.
'We felt very proud of Kingsley and
Cleo because they had been invited
'to join a guard of honour.'
'Afghan hounds were going to
salute their king, because
'for the first time ever, the King of
Afghanistan was coming to London.'
MARCHING BAND PLAYS
'About 20 members of
the Southern Afghan Hound Society
'had brought their dogs along
to line the route
'and there were Afghans
of all colours and sizes.'
'And when the Queen pointed us out,
'the King of Afghanistan
seemed delighted to see us.
CHEERING
'For the first time in their lives,
'British Afghan hounds were seeing
people from their own country
'because in the carriages
that followed the Queen,
'there were more people from
the Royal Court of Afghanistan.'
ADAM CURTIS: But the ordered world,
where kings and queens ruled
and dogs behaved obediently,
was about to collapse.
In 1971, the King of Afghanistan
had come on his first ever
state visit to Britain
but it was also his last,
because his ambitious
Prime Minister, Mohammed Daoud,
was already plotting against him.
And in 1973,
Daoud took power in a coup.
He declared Afghanistan a republic,
and sent the King into exile.
DOGS BARK
Two months later,
Egypt attacked Israel
and a Middle East war started.
To begin with, it looked
as though Israel would be defeated.
But the American government came
to its rescue, airlifting arms
on a massive scale to prevent
the Israelis from being overwhelmed.
The Israelis counterattacked
and the Arabs faced a disaster.
But then Saudi Arabia
came to the rescue
because King Faisal realised
that his country had a weapon
that could stop Israel.
Overnight, Faisal raised
the price of oil five times
and threatened a complete embargo
unless America
forced Israel to pull back.
It worked. A ceasefire was agreed.
And everyone realised that
the balance of power in the world
had suddenly changed.
What we want is the complete
withdrawal of the Israeli forces
from the occupied Arab territories
and then you will have the oil
at the same level of September '73.
Is this demand absolute and rigid or
is this just a negotiating position?
Definitely. Definitely.
We won't give up any inch
of these lands.
Doesn't this new massive increase
in the price of oil
mean a change in
the world balance of power
between the developing nations
like you, the producers,
and us, the developed
industrialised nations?
Yes, it will.
And what do you think
arises from that?
Well, a new type of relationship.
You have to adjust yourself to
the new circumstances
and I think you have to sit down
and talk seriously with us
about this new era.
When Saudi Arabia
raised the price of oil,
they did it to change the political
balance of power in the world.
But it also had
another, unexpected, effect
because it allowed the men who ran
the banks and the financial system
in America and Britain to begin to
break free of political control.
Billions of dollars flooded
from the West into Saudi Arabia -
most of which the Saudis
didn't know what to do with.
So they gave them to
the Western banks to invest.
The banks then made a crucial
decision - they kept many
of those dollars free from
control by the American government
and they became a vast pool of
wealth, known as petrodollars,
that could be lent and traded
anywhere around the world
without political control.
As western politicians struggled
to deal with the economic
and social chaos that had been
created by the oil price rise,
their bankers were building
a new global financial system
based on recycling
the Saudi billions.
And the banks began to become
rich and powerful again.

WIND HOWLS
As western countries collapsed
economically in the 1970s,
students from Europe and America
fled from the chaos.
They came to Afghanistan
as a land of dreams.
A different, innocent world,
free of the corruption of politics
and money in the West.
MAN: Then you see some Afghan
come dozing out of the sand,
hardly give you a look,
and carry on past.
You long to ask, "Where are you
going? Where have you come from?"
But he just disappears into the murk,
going about his everyday business.
A traveller is someone
who proceeds through a country
under his own initiative,
with a certain internal drive
to learn,
to find out something more
than the superficial.
To me, an Afghan was some
figure from a woodblock print
in a book about India.
The reality of an Afghan
was so beyond that,
their strength of character
which comes through
in their most simple action.
This is a long jacket. For men.
For generation.
It goes from mother to daughter.
A possum.
This is antelope.
Look at this coat.
But Afghan students still believed
in the idea of revolution.
Back in the 1960s, many students
from Kabul University had been sent
to universities in America.
It had been part of the
modernisation project.
And they brought back with them
radical ideas
from the American student left.
Back in Kabul,
those ideas then got mixed up
with other left-wing theories
that the Afghan students found in
badly-translated Russian books
about Marxism.
And in 1978 they decided
to have a revolution.
One of the leaders was
Hafizullah Amin,
and after the revolution
he ordered a film to be made
about the role he had played.
Amin also starred in the film,
playing himself.
It shows policemen coming to Amin's
house to arrest him.
He tries to hide some secret papers.
But the policemen take him to jail,
leaving his wife and daughter.
Amin is then shown directing the
revolution from his prison cell.
And then riding on a tank
to the president's palace.
REPORTER: Tanks loyal to young
communist army officers
now guard the palace
where President Daoud ruled.
Inside, he and his family,
including his young grandchildren,
are shot dead when his palace guard
lost their courageous battle
to defend him.
Men from the different tribes
who live in this backward country
swarm all over tanks
knocked out in the battle.
They seem pleased to see the end
of the old, feudal regime.
ADAM CURTIS: The revolutionaries
gave a press conference.
Amin, it was announced,
would become Foreign Minister.
And the president of the
revolutionary council
was another ex-student -
Mohammed Taraki.
Our relationship with all the
countries, including Soviet Union,
and all our neighbours and
throughout the world will be peace,
will depend on the amount of their
support to our government
in political, economical field.
Does this mean, Mr President,
that you will be following a
strict policy of non-alignment?
This is quite correct.
The aim of the revolution was
to create a new Afghanistan,
and parades were held in Kabul
to celebrate the radical vision.
One of the main aims was to
redistribute land fairly,
to get rid of a feudal system
of landowners and peasants.
Every farmer was to be allowed
to own their own land.
And young revolutionaries from Kabul
were filmed going out
into the countryside
to measure out the new plots,
followed by the grateful farmers
kissing their new land certificates.
But in reality, the land reforms
set the seeds for a bitter conflict
in Helmand. It made the divisions
that had begun with President Daoud's
reforms in the 1960s much worse.
As the land was parcelled out,
families accused each other
of stealing the best bits.
And all sorts of hatreds
and rivalries
were born in Afghan rural society,
rivalries that would set village
against village, tribe against tribe.
And in Kabul, the revolutionaries
started to hate each other, too.
Hafizullah Amin decided
that he should be in charge,
and he arranged for his rival,
Taraki, to be killed.
Taraki was smothered with a cushion.
Amin ordered that anyone
who opposed the reforms
should be thrown in jail or killed.
In Helmand, 100 political prisoners
were taken up in a plane
and thrown into the giant lake
created by the American dam.
The Soviet leaders in Moscow became
terrified that Afghanistan
was falling apart and
they decided to intervene.
They rang Amin to tell him that
they were sending Russian troops
to help his revolution.
And at the end of 1979, the troops
began to arrive at Kabul Airport.
What the Russians didn't tell Amin
was that the troops were also
coming to kill him.
The Russians put a sniper
on one of the main roads in Kabul.
But Amin's convoy drove too fast
and the sniper missed.
GUNSHOT
THEY SPEAK OWN LANGUAGE
They tried again.
This time they put poison
in Amin's can of Pepsi
in the presidential palace.
But his nephew drank it instead...
and died.
Amin gave a banquet
in a palace outside Kabul.
The Soviets smuggled in a chef
who poisoned the food.
This time it worked -
all the guests, and Amin, fell
on the floor, writhing in agony.
But the Afghan servants
rang for help
and two Russian doctors turned up
who knew nothing of the plot.
They pumped Amin's stomach
and he revived.
So the Russian troops attacked
the palace, threw a grenade at Amin,
and shot him.

For ten years, the country had been
battered and torn apart
by waves of economic
and social chaos.
Reagan set out to give the country
a new sense of purpose.
He took all the problems,
even the most complex,
and turned them into
reassuring moral fables.
And abroad, the world
he depicted was one where,
although good might struggle
with evil for a while,
in the end, goodness and innocence
would triumph.
We have it in our power
to begin the world over again.
APPLAUSE
It was a vision of the world
that, over the next 20 years,
would rise up to possess all of us
in the West, both left and right.
Conflicts that, in the past, would
have been seen as political struggles
were redefined. They became instead
battles against dark, demonic forces
that threatened innocent people.
And the role of we,
the good people of the West,
was to intervene to save
those innocents.
One of the places this dream began
was Afghanistan.
America was already
helping the rebels
who were fighting the Russians, but
Reagan increased the aid massively
and made it the symbol
of his new vision.
He even dedicated the space shuttle
to the Afghan freedom fighters.
Just as the Columbia we think
represents man's finest aspirations
in the field of science
and technology,
so, too, does the struggle of the
Afghan people represent man's
highest aspirations for freedom.
Accordingly, I am dedicating,
on behalf of the American people,
the March 22nd launch of the Columbia
to the people of Afghanistan.
But right from the beginning
there was a dangerous,
destructive force at the very
heart of this project.
This was because Reagan's partner
in the battle to bring freedom
to Afghanistan was Saudi Arabia.
The Saudi intelligence agencies
worked with the CIA to ship arms
and money to the Afghan rebels.
On the surface, the Saudis did this
because a fellow Muslim country
had been invaded by communists.
But it was also part of their attempt
to export the dangerous
fundamentalism at the heart
of their own society.
In 1979, a group of Saudi radicals
had taken over the Grand Mosque in
Mecca.
For two weeks, the authorities
had fought running battles
with the insurgents.
They discovered that a number
of the attackers had been taught
by the most senior religious leader
in the country.
It made the ruling family
realise just how fragile
their grip on power was.
So as well as sending
the money and the weapons,
they encouraged young radicals
to go and fight in Afghanistan.
One of them was a young
Osama bin Laden.
The aim was to divert their anger.
But it meant that with the arms
would also come the pessimistic
and intolerant version
of Islam - Wahhabism.
To begin with, these ideas would have
little influence in Afghanistan.
But they would take hold there and
mutate into a dark and violent force
that was completely at odds
with Reagan's vision of freedom.
At the beginning, though, no-one
knew who to give the weapons to,
and an odd group of adventurers
went into Afghanistan to find out.
One of the first was a Texan
socialite called Joanne Herring.
When I went in to Afghanistan -
I don't even know how I got in -
the president of Pakistan flew me
to the border, you know,
the no man's land that the
British created - very wisely -
between Afghanistan and Pakistan.
And we boarded a truck -
I put on men's clothing -
and we got on this truck
and went somewhere.
And we went into these camps
and there would be these men
with beards and turbans...
in rags, really.
They had nothing.
And with their 1918 Enfield rifles,
they would stand there
and they'd say,
"To the last drop of blood!"
And your heart would just burst.
But I thought,
"What will they do with an unveiled
woman coming in here?"
And I thought, you know,
they really may kill me
because they might not understand
why I'm here. But they did.
They were so grateful. So grateful.
They said, "The world doesn't know.
Thank you for coming."
PLANES PASS OVERHEAD
EXPLOSION
My...heart was given
immediately to these people
who believed so much in their god,
and I think it's the same god...
..as I worship.
Just in another way.
And they would come back and, of
course, completely exhausted
and almost dead - those
who were still alive -
and then this new group would say,
"I can't wait to go out
and kill Russians."

In the early 1980s, the Soviet Union
was falling apart.
The attempt to create a planned
socialist society had failed.
It had become a stagnant world
where the shops were half empty,
criminal gangs looted the factories,
and no-one believed
in the system any longer.
The ageing Soviet leaders knew
that Russian society was collapsing
but they had no idea what to do.
And in the face of this, Afghanistan
became, for them, a last desperate
attempt to create a model version
of their original communist ideal.
Faced with a growing rebellion
in the countryside,
the Russians took over Afghanistan
and installed another student
revolutionary as president.
He was called Babrak Karmal
and he did what he was told.
And as well as the Russian troops,
thousands of teachers and doctors
came to set up programmes and
hospitals that were going to
transform the lives
of the Afghan people.
SHE SINGS IN OWN LANGUAGE
..it was 151...in the right

Why did you come to Afghanistan?
Was it compulsory posting or
was it of your own free choice?

I'm doctor.
I want to help people.
Patient. It is the main reason
I come to Afghanistan.
Do you say this right?
But it was your free choice that you
came here, you were not sent here?
Only free choice.
Only free choice.
And Afghan women were taught
to be independent
so they could free themselves
from the repression
of what the Soviets saw
as a backward religion.
You know, after the revolution,
the woman in Afghanistan will be
same, like man, yes?
They're the same.
You know what I mean?
You know, in society
and also in economy and everything.
But outside the cities,
the mujaheddin rebels
increased their attacks.
They were becoming more confident
and powerful.
Using weapons supplied by the
Americans and the Saudis,
they ambushed Russian convoys.
GUNFIRE AND EXPLOSIONS
The mujaheddin treatment
of their Russian prisoners
was ruthless and cruel.
..and we captured two Russians alive.
Then we took them to our commander.
And then the commander told us
to stone them into death.
And we took them and we
stoned them into death.
- They stoned them to death?
 Yes.
Have many people here stoned Russians
or Afghan communists to death?
MAN TRANSLATES
MURMURS OF AGREEMENT
In response, the Russians launched
search and destroy missions,
often bombing whole villages,
massacring hundreds of civilians.
The war became a vicious struggle,
with the mujaheddin using
equally brutal tactics.
And any idea of transforming
Afghanistan began to slip away,
and the Russians retreated
into the cities.
INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER
Comrade General, what is the military
situation in the country?
But the rebels came into the cities
and began to kill
the Russian civilians.
They hid bombs in everyday objects
that exploded the moment
anyone used them.
Everything around the Russians
became frightening and unstable.
The forces that they had unleashed
were pursuing them
and as they did so they began to eat
away at the very foundations
of Soviet communism.
One of the bravest and most honest
of the Russian journalists
in Afghanistan was Artyom Borovik.
He wrote, "We thought that we were
civilising a backwards country
"by exposing it to television,
to modern bombers, to schools,
"to the latest models of tanks,
"to books, to long-range artillery,
"to newspapers, to economic aid,
to AK-47s.
"But we rarely stopped to think
how Afghanistan would influence us,
"despite the hundreds of thousands
of Soviet soldiers, diplomats,
"journalists and political advisers
who passed through it.
"They were thrown into a country
where bribery, corruption,
"profiteering and drugs
were no less common
"than the long lines
in Soviet stores.
"These diseases can be far more
infectious and dangerous
"than hepatitis, particularly when
they reach epidemic proportions."
HE LAUGHS
Borovik said the Russians
resembled the astronauts
in a famous Soviet science fiction
film called Solaris.
The astronauts find a planet
covered with a giant ocean
that seems to be conscious.
And to try and influence the ocean,
they bombard it with X-rays.
What they don't realise is that
the ocean is irradiating them.
It is playing back,
in the astronauts' minds,
memories of the past,
but in such a vivid way that they
begin not to trust anything
that they think or believe.
Afghanistan, Borovik said,
was doing the same to the Russians.
It had led them to distrust the very
basis of everything they believed in.
And they were taking that
distrust back with them
into the heart of Russia.

The massive increase in the price
of oil imposed by the Saudis
had caused economic and
social chaos in the West.
Governments had struggled to deal
with it, but they had failed.
And in the 1980s, right-wing
governments came to power in Britain
and America who turned to radical
new ways to create economic growth.
To begin with, the new
policies seemed to work.
Inflation was squeezed
out of the system
and the economies began to stabilise.
But then there were other
unexpected consequences.
Interest rates had risen massively -
and this decimated manufacturing
industry in both Britain and America.
Factory after factory closed.
High-paid skilled jobs
were replaced by low-wage jobs
in the service industries,
and living standards began to fall.
But then the politicians
found a solution.
If you couldn't make wages
grow any longer,
instead you would get the banks
to lend people money.
And in the mid-1980s, governments
removed the restrictions
on the banks' lending,
and a wave of borrowing spread
through Britain and America.
Even if their wages were static,
people felt wealthier,
and had the money to buy things
and keep the economy working.
And the power to manage society began
to move even more from politics
to the financial system.
Weapons free, battle stations.
Weapons free, weapons free.
But there was one industry
in Britain that had survived
and, in fact, was growing.
It was the arms industry and
its vast trade with Saudi Arabia.
But rather than strengthening
the politicians' power,
it undermined it further,
through corruption.
REPORTER: The King's train
was 20 minutes late
arriving at Victoria Station.
It was delayed while a suspicious
box on a bridge over the track
was checked, and found
to be harmless.
When he eventually stepped
on to the platform,
it was to a full royal welcome.
ADAM CURTIS: Through the 1970s,
British arms companies had signed
more and more contracts
with the Saudis,
and they became a central
part of a new industry
that was run from the very
heart of the British government.
We're in the Ministry of Defence
in Whitehall.
Behind these doors there's a room.
A room which few people
apart from Arab Sheiks
and other potential foreign customers
have ever set eyes on before.
This way, please.
This is it, the permanent
Defence Equipment Exhibition,
the supermarket of the sales
organisation which this year
will sell nearly £600 million
worth of British military hardware
to foreign governments.
Week in, week out, overseas service
chiefs come here discreetly
to shop for anything from guided
missile destroyers and aircraft
to a pair of army boots.
And they've got quite a choice.
There are hundreds of individual
British manufacturers
in this business. Glossy coloured
brochures in every language,
including, of course, Arabic.
Everywhere in this amazing exhibition
there are models showing
the hardware in action,
showing what the hardware can do.
Big missiles, little missiles -
here's the short blowpipe
surface-to-air missile with which
one soldier can bring
an aircraft out of the sky,
straight from the shoulder.
More missiles here,
the short Tigercat missile,
simple in operation, recommended
for its high lethality at low cost.
Aircraft are very expensive
these days
and so you don't want them
to have just one...
ADAM CURTIS: By the 1980s, the giant
orders from Saudi Arabia
had become essential to Britain.
While much of British
industry had closed,
the arms business kept growing.
..from air to ground.
No, no, no, I'm the Prime Minister.
I have to see the super
saleswomen do their job.
ADAM CURTIS: And in 1985 Mrs Thatcher
announced what was going to be
the biggest arms deal in history.
The extraordinary arms deal,
which has impressed military experts
throughout the world.
It emerged today that Britain
and Saudi Arabia have signed
what's thought to be one of
the biggest arms agreements.
The deal will mean Saudi Arabia
will get many more combat planes,
training aircraft, new mine hunters,
two new airbases,
and much training and support.
It means Britain is pulling
level with, if not overtaking,
the United States as the biggest
military supplier to the Saudis.
ADAM CURTIS: The Al-Yamamah deal
was presented as a triumph
of British ingenuity and skill.
But ever since, there have been
allegations that really it was
secured by vast bribes to key members
of the Saudi establishment.
British Aerospace admit
that there were payments,
but insist they were not bribes.
But then, in 1990,
it became clear that all the
arms trade with Saudi Arabia
had been a complete charade.
Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait
and the leaders of Saudi Arabia
realised that,
despite all this hardware -
all the planes, the missiles,
the bombs and the radar systems -
that their country was incapable of
using it properly to defend itself
against Saddam Hussein.
So they had to turn to America
and its military might for help.
At my direction, elements
of the 82nd Airborne Division,
as well as key units of the
United States Air Force,
are arriving today to take up
defensive positions in Saudi Arabia.
I took this action to assist
the Saudi Arabian government
in the defence of its homeland.
Osama bin Laden had
returned from Afghanistan
and he went to see the Saudi Defence
Minister and pleaded with him
not to let the Americans come.
He offered to raise a force of
mujaheddin fighters in Afghanistan
and bring them to defend
Saudi Arabia instead.
But the Defence Minister
turned him down.
And within weeks, over
half a million American soldiers
had arrived in Saudi Arabia.
Bin Laden saw it as the corrupt
takeover by the West
of the very heart of Islam.
Cameraman, please show them
what's going on, if you could.
Show the street, if nothing else.
ADAM CURTIS: And he decided that
America, although it had been
his ally in Afghanistan,
was the real enemy.
Show them the sky, if you could.

When the Russians left Afghanistan,
the different mujaheddin groups
turned on each other
and began a vicious struggle
for power.
Kabul was completely destroyed
as the different groups fired
thousands of rockets indiscriminately
into the heart of the city.
And Kabul became a living hell.
PEOPLE SHOUT
SHE SHOUTS IN OWN LANGUAGE
EXPLOSION
MAN: Jesus Christ.
The mujaheddin leaders transformed.
They became brutal warlords,
tearing the country apart.
The Americans had stopped
sending any money or arms,
so to fund themselves, the warlords
turned to the heroin trade,
and they began to export more
and more opium to the West.
The poppy fields of Helmand
became the centre of a
multimillion-dollar business,
irrigated by the dams and canals
built 40 years before
by the American government.
Out of the chaos came two extreme
and violent reactions.
Both ruthlessly simplified the world
and both, although they were
completely contradictory,
were rooted in Wahhabism,
the intolerant fundamentalism
that came from Saudi Arabia.
One was the Taliban.
They started as a group of students
in religious schools in Pakistan
called madrassas, where many Afghan
children had gone to study.
They became the core of a revolution
that spread rapidly through
Afghanistan.
Although they were in Pakistan, most
of the madrassas had been created
over the previous 20 years
by money from Saudi Arabia.
They were part of the massive effort
that had been started by King Faisal
to spread fundamentalism
throughout the Islamic world.
And the ideas that
the madrassas taught
were very close to
Saudi Wahhabism.
When the Taliban swept into Kabul,
they went to the Presidential Palace
and tore out all painted images
of living things,
even removing the faces
off the stone lions.
The society the Taliban built
was based on an imagined idea
of the past, a re-creation of how
they thought Islamic society
had been run in the 7th century.
All modernization was swept away.
Women were not to be educated,
and all film and music was banned.
And even the bodies of dead
communists were dug up and burnt -
to cleanse and purify the land.
The other reaction came from
Osama bin Laden.
Bin Laden had come back to
Afghanistan
determined to lead
an Islamist revolution.
But his ideas were very
different from the Taliban.
He wanted to use Islamic principles
in a new way -
to make it a revolutionary force
in the modern world,
to go forwards, not backwards.
But the problem was that these ideas
had failed to capture
the public imagination,
not just in Afghanistan
but throughout most of
the Islamic world.
Bin Laden was convinced that what was
stopping this revolution
was America.
He had seen how American money
had corrupted Saudi Arabia.
Now he believed that America was
corrupting the minds of Muslim people
everywhere, and preventing them from
rising up and liberating themselves.
HE SPEAKS OWN LANGUAGE
Bin Laden's Islamist ideas
began to mutate
and become mixed with the intolerant
and anti-modern anger of Wahhabism.
Out of it came a dark
and apocalyptic jihadism.
It said that the only way
to create a revolution
would be to attack what he called
"the far enemy" directly.
The dramatic shock would somehow
liberate the masses,
but all discussion of what kind of
society would result dropped away,
and was replaced by stark vision
of the coming battle
between good and evil.
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
CROWD CHANTS
America and the coalition forces
invaded Afghanistan
not just to find those behind
the attacks on America
but also to transform Afghanistan
into a modern democracy.
It was a grand plan
but the logic behind it was simple.
If the innocent people of Afghanistan
could be liberated
from the evil forces
that had terrorised them,
then they would become
free individuals.
And out of that, a democracy,
like those in the West,
would grow naturally.
Tens of thousands of Americans
and Europeans would pass through
the country over the next ten years -
soldiers, diplomats, experts,
political advisers and journalists.
All of them trying to
build this new society.
But few of them stopped to think
whether what had happened
to the Russians 20 years before
might also happen to them.
That, in a strange way, Afghanistan
has revealed to us the emptiness
and hypocrisy of many our beliefs.
And that we may be
returning from there
also haunted by mujaheddin ghosts,
knowing that, underneath,
we believe in nothing.
After the shock of the attacks in
September 2001, the greatest fear
was that the American economy
might collapse as well.
In response, the politicians,
advised by their economic experts,
cut interest rates to almost zero.
This allowed cheap money
to flood through the system
and avoid disaster.
The banks lent money
to anyone and everyone.
It was the politicians looking to
the financial system
to stabilise the country.
SHE TALKS IN OWN LANGUAGE
At the same time, thousands
of experts and advisers
flooded into Afghanistan.
Their aim was to transform the
country into a modern democracy.
This optimistic vision
of a future Afghanistan
was celebrated in the Kabul Stadium.
It was the same stadium where the
Russians had celebrated
their new model for Afghanistan
20 years before.
Last year we think that we can never
can be alive again, we will die.
But now we are...we are thinking
that we are alive again,
and we are too happy.
And also, from America,
that they help a lot,
we are very appreciative of them.
Thanks a lot.
I think now everything is normal.
The man and woman
can work in one place
and no any different between them,
and I think everything is going
to...good day by day.
- And this is our school...
- That's your school board.
- Yeah.
- OK.
Actually, can I just... Hello? Hello?
ADAM CURTIS: All kinds of groups
came to Kabul to help the project.
It was like a snapshot of what those
in power in America and Britain
believed made democracy work.
As well as the obvious lessons
in how to organise elections
and conferences on how to stop
the narcotics trade,
young Afghan students
were also given lessons
in how to make conceptual art.
So, this is, in some ways,
often called the first
piece of conceptual art.
MAN TRANSLATES
Does anyone know what it is?
MAN TRANSLATES
I don't expect the ladies to know.
MAN TRANSLATES
MAN: Toilets.
- Exactly.
An artist called Marcel Duchamp,
who's very important in Western art,
put this toilet in an art gallery
about 100 years ago.
It was a huge revolution.
Are you ready to see how it is used?
Underlying it all was a belief
that the battle
was to create a good society,
one that would be strong enough
to stand against the bad,
anti-democratic forces that had
overwhelmed Afghanistan.
But then it began
to get confusing.
The Americans discovered that was it
was very difficult to know exactly
who was good and who was bad.
When they had invaded, they had
been helped by Afghans
who were already
fighting the Taliban.
The Americans had assumed they would
help to create the new democracy,
and appointed many of them
to run the country.
But now it turned out that many of
them were actually the very same
corrupt and violent warlords
who the Taliban had overthrown.
And they were using their new power
to terrorise the country
all over again.
Gul Agha Sherzai had been made
Governor of Kandahar.
But he was also alleged to be
making a million dollars a week
from running the opium trade,
while at the same time siphoning
off millions from the Americans
in inflated contracts.
When President Karzai was persuaded
to remove Sherzai,
he simply made him governor
of another province.
But he was not alone.
Throughout much of Afghanistan,
the warlords had returned to power.
But this time it was worse.
The massive influx of American money
allowed them to extend their networks
of bribery and corruption to every
corner of Afghan society.
But the money was not just
corrupting individuals.
It was undermining the whole
structure of society,
above all the police.
Rather than enforcing the law,
the police had become transformed
into violent militias
who worked for the warlords.
They organised a massive
expansion of the drug trade.
And they also terrorised
the local people.
Ordinary Afghans came to
hate the police
and they saw them as the enemy.
And the Americans also weren't
as good as they appeared.
Jack Idema had been
portrayed as a hero,
working with the US Special Forces
to hunt down bin Laden.
He had arrived in Kabul three years
before and become a legendary figure.
CBS television had made an hour-long
special about the secret world
of terror that Idema had
discovered in the mountains.
It showed a tape that he said he had
found of the Al-Qaeda group training.
But then Idema was arrested.
The Americans said
that he was a fake.
He had nothing to do with them,
and had conned CBS.
They alleged that
Idema had a dungeon,
hidden underneath his house in Kabul,
where he tortured innocent Afghans.
Tell him, basically I'm tired
of the lies. Where's his village?
In three minutes...he'll be dead.
MAN SPEAKS OWN LANGUAGE
Idema was put on trial in Kabul.
He insisted, though, he had been
working with the highest levels
of the US military and government.
I know what's wrong with you...
Jack, who are you working for?
Uh, we were working for the
US Counter-Terrorist Group
and working with the Pentagon
and some other federal agencies.
So you were working with
US knowledge,
with US government knowledge?
We were in touch with the Pentagon
sometimes five times a day,
at the highest level, every day.
How do you feel about being
sort of let go by the Americans?
Fucked.
You can't use that quote.
Well, there you go,
that's the quote, my dear.
This government and our government
knew every single thing
we were doing.
ADAM CURTIS: Jack Idema was found
guilty and sent to jail.
But then it got even more confusing.
Because reports emerged that
the real American military
had been doing exactly
the same as Jack Idema.
They had set up a special torture
centre in an old Soviet hangar
at Bagram Air Base.
Ordinary Afghans were
shackled to the ceiling
and subjected to all
kinds of violent abuse.
But they went further
than Jack Idema.
The reports said that two of the
victims had been tortured to death.
Of course, it was very provocative.
People were very angry, and I think
it's important to understand
that when this kind of art emerged
it was partly political.
It was to fight against
the system and say,
"What is art is what I think it is."
One of the biggest concerns
we have is about the casualties
that took place because of
the result of cluster bombs.
OK, that's fine.
- OK, is that fly going to...?
- That fly.
- You can hear it, actually.
- You can, can't you?
FLY BUZZES
It's a blowie.
- It'll land.
- It's a blowie. Fuck off.
It's a bug.
Ah...
THUMP!
LAUGHING: This is an interview
about casualties.
There's going to be one more.
Ah! Jesus.
On the whole, I think everyone
finds it a very important event
and even more so,
the fact we're abroad
and not able to celebrate it at home.
Hence we're very happy to, uh,
do some small token towards
the Queen's celebrations.
And why, why a beacon here in Kabul?
I have absolutely no idea.
By 2006, the British and the
Americans realised that their project
to bring democracy to Afghanistan
was failing,
and large parts of the country
were descending into anarchy.
In Helmand, in Southern Afghanistan,
armed groups had risen up
and there was constant fighting.
The coalition were convinced that
this was the return of the Taliban,
and British troops were sent there
to restore order
and to help protect
the regional government.
But when the British commanders
asked the Ministry of Defence
for information about what was
happening in Helmand,
there was none.
There weren't even any
satellites looking at it.
They had all been moved
to look at Iraq.
The one thing they did know was that
they were going to the very heartland
of the tribe that had decisively
defeated the British
125 years before
at the Battle of Maiwand.
The British commander called
a meeting with the local elders.
It was in the very same town that
the American engineers had built,
50 years before, when they
were constructing the dam
across the Helmand River.
All three of us, the security,
governance, and for development.
We are the three who work
together as the British.
I know you've seen many foreigners
arriving in your country.
ADAM CURTIS: The commander
reassured the elders
that the British were there
to defeat the Taliban
and support the regional government.
COMMANDER: ..my forefathers
were even here before.
ADAM CURTIS: Next door, his officers
were preparing to entertain
the elders with a showing of
David Attenborough's series
The Blue Planet.
But the elders thought that the
British had completely misunderstood
the problem.
The real enemy was not the Taliban,
but the corrupt and vicious
government that President Karzai
had installed in Helmand
and was doing nothing to stop.
HE SPEAKS OWN LANGUAGE
And tell Mr President Karzai
if he bring a good governance,
the security situation
will be the same.
If you are here for 100 years,
it will be not good.
Once he brought good governance,
good people to the government,
then we have hope that the security
will be change.
The elders left without
watching The Blue Planet.
Before they came to Helmand,
the British had forced President
Karzai to get rid of its governor.
But they didn't realise that
he had left behind him
a completely corrupted society.
And nothing was what it seemed.
When the British
went into towns like Sangin,
they tried to support the police.
But the police were really the armed
militia for the sacked governor.
To the locals, this meant
that the western troops
were supporting their oppressors.
So they started to attack
the British.
Get inside!
Shit the bed.
That's close, that one,
out the back there.
It was.
Right, mate, get under it.
- Shit.
- Shit.
- They're overshooting on us.
- Stay down, lads, stay down.
- Is that incoming or outcoming?
- Fucking incoming now.
ADAM CURTIS: The British thought that
this must mean they were Taliban.
So in response they dropped
giant bombs on them.
Fuckin' hell.
MAN LAUGHS
- Did you get that, did you?
- Yes, I did. Fucking hell.
MAN LAUGHS
LAUGHING: Holy shit.
But this then devastated
the town centres,
which made even more local people
join in the attacks.
Seeing their chance,
the real ideological Taliban,
who were now based in Pakistan,
flooded back in and they started
attacking the British, too.
GUNFIRE
At the same time the corrupt militias
who worked for the local government
also turned against the British.
Faced by the chaos, the British still
clung to their simple narrative
of good and evil.
They - the Western forces -
were good.
And all the different groups who were
attacking them were Taliban,
and were bad.
But this extraordinary simplification
had terrible consequences.
Because if you were an Afghan
and wanted to kill a rival,
all you had to do
was go to the British
and tell them that he was a Taliban
and the British would
obediently wipe him out.
INCOMING ROCKET
- Fuck!
- Fuckin' hell!
- Yeah!
- Whoo!
The British were being used.
The terrible truth was that
the British presence
did not contain the war.
It did the very opposite.
It escalated it so much
that it ran out of control.
And the bodies - Afghan and British -
piled up.
The dynamic was one of manipulation.
They understood how we saw
the conflict.
They presented their local
group conflict,
their civil war between groups that
had been going on for 35 years.
They presented everything
in that dynamic.
So they came to us and said, "Those
people over there are Taliban."
And we went, "OK." And we went off
and dealt with them.
But, actually, we were dealing
with their previous enemies.
So we were just creating more
enemies for ourselves.
And you ended up in
a downward spiral where,
because everyone was manipulating us,
we ended up fighting everyone.
And then, in return, everyone who
fought us immediately became Taliban.
The way that we decided whether
you were Taliban or not
was whether you were firing at us.
SPORADIC GUNFIRE
Post 2001, whereas we've understood
the conflict as good/bad,
black/white, government/Taliban,
they've understood it as a shifting
mosaic of different groups
and leaders fighting each other,
effectively over power.
And the currency of power
in Helmand is opium.
That's largely what the
conflict's about.
So what you're saying is that
the...what we thought were
the Taliban was actually an allergic
reaction to us turning up
into the middle of
a complex civil war?
Correct.
- We made things worse?
- Yes.
EXPLOSION
- Where was that?
- That's over there on the left.
Oh, for fuck's sakes.
But then the British and the
Americans had to face up to the fact
that they might not be as good and
innocent as they thought they were.
HE SPEAKS OWN LANGUAGE
In 2009, the Presidential elections
were held.
Hamid Karzai stood and allied himself
with some of the most
powerful warlords.
But there were allegations that
the warlords rigged the vote
on a massive scale.
This was backed up with videos
that seemed to show
the warlords' followers
stuffing the ballot boxes
with hundreds of fake voting papers.
The coalition tried to
rerun the election.
But Karzai's main opponent refused
because he said it would be
even more corrupt.
So the British and Americans
had no choice
but to abandon their great dream
of a real democracy in Afghanistan.
They gave in and allowed Karzai
to become president again.
I still don't trust that fella.
Things look rather bad, sir.
What are we going to do?
Do, Captain? We're British,
we won't do anything.
- Till it's too late.
- Precisely.
That's the first sensible thing
you've said today.
- Thank you, sir.
- No, gentlemen, as always,
we will carry on as if nothing
was going to happen.
This morning...
the Federal Reserve, with support
of the Treasury Department,
took additional actions to mitigate
disruptions to our financial markets.
Today's events are fast moving.
But the chairman of the Federal
Reserve and the secretary
of the Treasury are on top of them,
and will take the appropriate steps
to promote stability in our markets.
ADAM CURTIS: And at
the very same time
as their simple plan was falling
apart in Afghanistan,
the politicians had to face
a crisis at home.
They had given power to the banks
because the bankers and the financial
technocrats had promised
that they could hold
the economy stable.
But in 2008, the whole intricate
system of credit and loans
that the banks had
created collapsed,
and there was growing panic as
giant financial institutions
faced bankruptcy.
The politicians in America
and Britain stepped in
and rescued the banks.
As they did so, they began to
discover that most of the major
financial institutions were also
riddled with corruption.
But unlike President Roosevelt
in the 1930s,
they didn't then try
and reform the system.
Instead they simply propped it up
by literally pouring billions more
pounds and dollars into the banks,
hoping that this would somehow
spread through the economies.
They had no other idea.
GUNFIRE
CHILDREN CRY
And, faced by disaster
in Afghanistan,
the politicians did exactly
the same there, too.
The Americans knew that the
idea of democracy was failing.
In desperation, they poured even more
money into the Afghan economy.
The idea was that this would somehow
create a simpler,
economic form of democracy
and that the free market
would liberate people.
They would become model consumers
following their own
rational self-interest,
just like in the economies
of the west.
And in an odd way, it worked.
Many of those in charge of the money
did behave in their own
rational self-interest.
They simply stole the money,
smuggled it out through
Kabul Airport,
and used it to buy
luxury properties in Dubai.
During this period it was estimated
that 10 million a day
was being taken out
of Afghanistan this way.
SHOUTING IN OWN LANGUAGE
The scandal seemed to
confirm for many Afghans
that the United States had not
brought democracy or free markets
to their country,
but instead a corrupt crony
capitalism that had taken over
Afghanistan and its government.
Which was the very same allegation
that as being made against
politicians at home,
in America and in Britain.
At the end of 2014,
British soldiers left Afghanistan.
All the bases were wiped out
as if nothing had been there.
Even the war memorials were packed up
and taken back to Staffordshire.
But they weren't the only fighters
who had left Afghanistan.
Abu Musab al-Zarqawi
had gone to Afghanistan
to fight the Soviets
back in the 1980s.
Then he had stayed on
to work with Osama bin Laden.
And in 2003 he went to Iraq
and set up a jihadist group
called Al-Qaeda in Iraq
to fight the American invasion.
Allahu Akbar!
Allahu Akbar!
Al Zarqawi was powerfully
influenced by bin Laden's ideas.
But he took them much further.
He and his group killed anyone
who they decided did not believe
in their fundamentalist ideas
and deserved to die.
Even the original founders
of Al-Qaeda were shocked,
and they sent him a letter telling
him to stop killing civilians.
But al-Zarqawi ignored them.
He was convinced that
the insurgency in Iraq
could be used to spread an Islamist
revolution throughout the Arab world.
HE SPEAKS OWN LANGUAGE
But before he could do this,
the Americans found al-Zarqawi
and dropped a large bomb on him.
But it didn't stop
the spread of the idea.
Despite al-Zarqarwi's death
his organisation survived,
and began to mutate into something
even more ferocious and ambitious.
But as it did so, it was possessed
by ghosts from the past.
What re-emerged was the fierce,
intolerant vision of Wahhabism
that had survived from the 1920s.
It had spread outwards through
Afghanistan in the 1980s and '90s
where it had become mixed
with modern Islamist ideas.
But now, faced by the nihilistic
horror in post-invasion Iraq,
any ideas of building a new
revolutionary future disappeared,
and, instead, the conservative
and backward-looking Wahhabism
became the dominating influence,
with its desire to retreat
to an imagined past.
In 2013, the Islamic State of Iraq
and the Levant was formed.
Known as ISIS in the West.
Its aim is to create
a unified caliphate
throughout the Islamic world.
And although it uses the techniques
of modern media
it is, at heart, the same violent
dream that had driven the Bedouins
who had created the Kingdom
of Saudi Arabia in the 1920s.
Back then, the King of Saudi Arabia
had found it necessary
to try and exterminate them
because they, too, wanted
to go on and conquer
the whole of the Islamic world.
He machine-gunned them in the bleak
sands of the Arabian Peninsula.
And now the Saudis, along with
the British and Americans,
are trying to do
the same thing again -
to kill the jihadists and their ideas
in the sand dunes of
Northern Iraq and Syria.
But it is an uncertain war.
Western politicians are having
to accept that the simple division
between good and evil doesn't exist.
By bombing ISIS, they are helping
the evil President Assad
to remain in power.
And those in charge don't even know
how big a threat ISIS really is.
Is it a dark, existential threat?
Or is it really a front,
being used in an ongoing complex
power struggle inside Iraq?
We just don't know.
At the end of the Soviet
science fiction film Solaris,
the astronaut returns home.
Everything seems real and normal.
But somehow he doesn't trust
in anything any longer.
Although we have the returned
from Afghanistan,
our leaders also seem to have
lost faith in anything.
And the simple stories they tell us
don't make sense any longer.
The experience of Afghanistan
has made us begin to realise that
there is something else out there
but we just don't have
the apparatus to see it.
What is needed is a new story.
And one that we can believe in.
