<i>Jamie is over and Jamie is gone</i>
<i>Jamie's decided
it's time to move on</i>
<i>Jamie has new dreams
he's building upon</i>
<i>And I'm still hurting</i>
<i>Jamie arrived
at the end of the line</i>
<i>Jamie's convinced
that the problems are mine</i>
<i>Jamie is probably
feeling just fine</i>
<i>And I'm still hurting</i>
<i>What about lies, Jamie?</i>
<i>What about things</i>
<i>That you swore to be true?</i>
<i>What about you, Jamie?</i>
<i>What about you?</i>
<i>Jamie is sure
something wonderful died</i>
<i>Jamie decides
it's his right to decide</i>
<i>Jamie's got secrets
he doesn't confide</i>
<i>And I'm still hurting</i>
<i>Go and hide</i>
<i>And run away</i>
<i>Run away</i>
<i>Run and find something better</i>
<i>Go and ride</i>
<i>The sun away</i>
<i>Run away</i>
<i>Like it's simple</i>
<i>Like it's right</i>
<i>Give me a day, Jamie</i>
<i>Bring back the lies</i>
<i>Hang them back on the wall</i>
<i>Maybe I'd see</i>
<i>How you could be</i>
<i>So certain that we</i>
<i>Had no chance</i>
<i>At all</i>
<i>Jamie is over
and where can I turn?</i>
<i>Covered with scars
I did nothing to earn</i>
<i>Maybe there's somewhere
a lesson to learn</i>
<i>But that wouldn't change the fact</i>
<i>That wouldn't speed the time</i>
<i>Once the foundation's cracked</i>
<i>And I'm</i>
<i>sun hurting</i>
Jamie... Jamie, wait.
<i>I'm breaking my mother's heart</i>
<i>The longer I stand
looking at you</i>
<i>The more I hear it
splinter and crack</i>
<i>From 90 miles away</i>
<i>I'm breaking my mother's heart</i>
<i>The JCC of Spring Valley
is shaking</i>
<i>And crumbling to the ground</i>
<i>And my grandfather's rolling</i>
<i>Rolling in his grave</i>
<i>If you had a tattoo
that wouldn't matter</i>
<i>If you had a shaved head
that would be coo!</i>
<i>If you came from Spain or Japan
or the back of a van</i>
<i>Just as long as you're
not from Hebrew school</i>
<i>I'd say, "Now I'm
getting somewhere!</i>
<i>I'm finally
breaking through!"</i>
<i>I'd say, "Hey! Hey!
Shiksa goddess!</i>
<i>I've been waiting
for someone like you”</i>
Oh, my God!
OK, hold on. Hold on.
What's happening?
I have to... I have to take this in.
You don't understand.
<i>I have been waiting through
Danica Schwartz and Erica Weiss</i>
<i>And the Handelman twins</i>
<i>I have been waiting through
Heather Greenblatt, Annie Mincus,</i>
<i>Karen Pincus and Lisa Katz</i>
<i>And Stacey Rosen, Ellen Kaplan,
Julie Silver and Janie Stein</i>
<i>I've had Shabbat dinners
on Friday nights</i>
<i>With every Shapiro
in Washington Heights!</i>
<i>But the minute I first met you</i>
<i>I could barely catch my breath</i>
<i>I've been standing for days
with the phone in my hand</i>
<i>Like an idiot scared to death</i>
<i>I've been wandering
through the desert</i>
<i>I've been beaten I've been hit</i>
<i>My people have suffered
for thousands of years</i>
<i>And I don't give a shit</i>
<i>If you had</i> a <i>pierced tongue
that wouldn't matter</i>
<i>If you once were in jail
or you once were a man</i>
<i>If your mother and your brother
had relations with each other</i>
<i>And your father was connected
to the Gotti clan, I'd say,</i>
<i>"Well, nobody's perfect"</i>
<i>it's tragic but it's true</i>
<i>I'd say, "Hey! Hey!
Shiksa goddess!</i>
<i>I've been waiting
for someone like you”</i>
<i>Breaking the circle</i>
<i>You</i>
<i>Taking the light</i>
<i>You</i>
<i>You are the story
I should write</i>
<i>I have to write!</i>
<i>If you drove an RV
that wouldn't matter</i>
<i>If you like to drink blood
I think it's cute</i>
<i>If you've got a powerful connection
to your firearm collection</i>
<i>I'd say draw a bead and shoot</i>
<i>I'm your Hebrew slave
at your service</i>
<i>Just tel! me what to do</i>
<i>I'd say, "Hey, hey, hey...</i>
<i>I've been waiting for someone</i>
<i>I've been praying for someone</i>
<i>I think that I could be in love</i>
<i>With someone</i>
<i>Like you"</i>
<i>I guess I can't believe
you really came</i>
<i>And that we're sitting
on this pier</i>
<i>See, I'm smiling</i>
<i>That means I'm happy
that you're here</i>
<i>I stole this sweater
from a costume shop</i>
<i>It makes me look like Daisy</i> Mae
<i>See, we're laughing</i>
<i>I think we're gonna be OK</i>
<i>I mean, we'll have to
try a little harder</i>
<i>And bend things to and fro</i>
<i>To make this love as special</i>
<i>As it was five years ago</i>
<i>I mean you made it to Ohio</i>
<i>Who knows where else</i>
<i>We can go</i>
<i>I think you're really
gonna like this show</i>
<i>I'm pretty sure it doesn't suck</i>
<i>See, you're laughing</i>
<i>And I'm smiling</i>
<i>By a river in Ohio</i>
<i>And you're mine</i>
<i>We're doing fine</i>
<i>I think we both can see
what could be better</i>
<i>I'll own when I was wrong</i>
<i>With all
we've had to go through</i>
<i>We'll end up twice as strong</i>
<i>And so we'll start
again this weekend</i>
<i>And just keep rolling along</i>
Baby, I... I'm so sorry.
I can't stay this weekend.
I have this stupid Random House thing,
it's tomorrow.
I couldn't get out.
<i>I didn't know
you had to go so soon</i>
I'm so sorry, sweetheart.
<i>I thought we had a little time</i>
I know.
<i>Look, whatever If you have to</i>
<i>Then you have to</i>
<i>So whatever</i>
<i>it's all right</i>
<i>We'll have tonight</i>
Yeah, um...
See, the thing is, I tried to get
a plane ticket for tomorrow,
but the only ones
available were for tonight.
So, um, you know, I can come back
on Monday if you want.
<i>You know what makes me crazy?
I'm sorry, can I say this?</i>
<i>You know what makes me nuts?
The fact that we could be together</i>
<i>Here together Sharing our night</i>
<i>Spending our time
And you are gonna choose</i>
<i>Someone else to be with</i>
<i>No, you are</i>
I'm not... That's not true.
<i>Yes, Jamie, that's exactly
what you're doing</i>
<i>You could be here with me
or be there with them</i>
<i>As usual guess which you pick</i>
Baby, I have to go!
<i>No, Jamie, you do
not have to go</i>
<i>To another party with the same
20 jerks you already know</i>
<i>You could stay with your wife
on her fucking birthday</i>
<i>And you could, God forbid,
even see my show</i>
<i>And I know in your soul
it must drive you crazy</i>
<i>That you won't get to play
with your little girlfriends</i>
- You're being crazy!
- No, I'm not, no, I'm not!
<i>And the point is, Jamie</i>
<i>That you can't spend
a single day that's not about</i>
<i>You and you and nothing but you</i>
<i>"Marvelous" novelist, you</i>
<i>Isn't he wonderful?
Just 28</i>
<i>The savior of writing</i>
<i>You and you and nothing but you</i>
<i>Miles and piles of you</i>
<i>Pushing through windows
and bursting through walls</i>
<i>En route to the sky</i>
<i>And I</i>
<i>I swear to God
H! never understand</i>
<i>How you can stand there
straight and tail</i>
<i>And see Pm crying</i>
<i>And not do anything at all</i>
Yeah, hello?
Yeah, this is Jamie Wellerstein.
Oh, OK.
Sure.
Wait, who? Who told you?
Wait, wait, you...
you read my manuscript?
But how did you...
Oh, oh, yeah, Professor Adler.
No, no, no, no,
that's... that's great!
That's, uh... that's... That's really...
It's a second draft, you know.
It's... it's a work in progress,
it's getting there, though.
I'm sorry, who...
Random House read it?
Oh, my... that's, um...
That's great. That's...
Holy shit!
I'm sorry, um, that's...
no, no, no, no, no!
No, no. No.
OK. Yes. Yes.
Yes, I'm 23. I'm...
No, I didn't finish,
but whatever. That's, uh...
Yes, I can meet you.
Uh, New York.
Yes, I'm in New York.
Yeah, I live here.
OK. Yes.
I mean, I can come today.
Great. Great.
Great. Great. Great.
Oh, my God. Uh, OK.
Yes, I will see you there.
I am so...
so looking... looking forward
to meeting you, Ms. Whitfield.
OK. OK. OK, Linda.
We're like friends, Linda.
Uh, OK, great.
That's... that's fine.
OK, bye.
What?!
Hi.
<i>Hey, so I was thinking
about what you said.</i>
- <i>Let's move in together.</i>
- <i>Really?!</i>
- <i>Jamie, what happened?</i>
- <i>I'll tell you later, all right?</i>
<i>Just find an apartment,
and I love you.</i>
I... Jamie... Jamie, wait!
<i>Did I just hear
an alarm start ringing?</i>
<i>Did I see sirens go ﬂying past?</i>
<i>Though I don't know
what tomorrow's bringing</i>
<i>I've got</i> a <i>singular impression</i>
<i>Things are moving too fast</i>
<i>I'm gliding smooth
as a figure skater</i>
<i>I'm riding hot
as a rocket blast</i>
<i>I just expected it
ten years later</i>
<i>I've got</i> a <i>singular impression</i>
<i>Things are moving too fast</i>
<i>And you say
"Oh, no, step on the brakes</i>
<i>Do whatever it takes,
but stop this train</i>
<i>Slow, slow,
the light's turning red"</i>
<i>But 1 say "No, no,</i>
<i>Whatever I do I barrel on through
and I don't complain"</i>
<i>No matter what I try
I'm flying full speed ahead</i>
<i>I'm never worried
to walk the wire</i>
<i>I won't do anything
just half-assed</i>
<i>But with the stakes
getting somewhat higher</i>
<i>I've got</i> a <i>singular impression</i>
<i>That things are moving too fast</i>
<i>I found a woman I love</i>
<i>And 1 found an agent who loves me</i>
He's like a young Jonathan Franzen.
<i>Things might get bumpy</i>
<i>But some people
analyze every detail</i>
<i>Some people stall
when they can't see the trail</i>
<i>Some people freeze out of fear
that they'll fail</i>
<i>But 1 keep rolling on</i>
<i>Some people can't find
success with their art</i>
<i>Some people never feel
love in their heart</i>
<i>Some people can't tell
the two things apart</i>
<i>But 1 keep rolling on</i>
<i>Oh, oh</i>
<i>Maybe 1 can't follow through</i>
<i>But oh, oh</i>
<i>What else am I supposed to do?</i>
<i>Ooh</i>
Hey, Mike, it's Cathy.
Uh, yeah, how are you?
Um, yeah,
no, just two quick things.
I'm not going
to talk your ear off. Uh...
I just wanted to know if you got
the reviews that I sent you
from last summer?
Thank you.
Yeah, it's really exciting.
Um...
No, the second thing was just...
if you have anything
you want to send me in on,
I'm sort of suddenly...
free this summer,
I'm, like, available, so...
Um... Yes.
Yeah, as soon as I'm doing something
in the city, I'll let you know.
Uh-huh. Uh...
OK. No, no, no, no, I understand.
OK, thanks.
That wasn't...
that wasn't too painful, was it?
Right. OK. Um...
OK. Bye, Mike.
OK, ladies.
Uh... Mariah, Taylor, Rachel,
Lauren and Sophia.
Follow me to the
dance audition.
And everyone else,
thank you very much.
<i>I dreamed of writing
like the high and mighty</i>
<i>Now I'm the subject
of a bidding war</i>
<i>I met my personal Aphrodite</i>
<i>I'm doing things
I never dreamed of before</i>
<i>We start to take

<i>Found an apartment on 73rd</i>
<i>The Atlantic Monthly's

<i>Two thousand bucks

<i>I left Columbia

Hi, can I help you?
Yes, hi. I'm looking for Alise Michaels.
- Mr. Wellerstein.
- Yes.
Hey, I'm Dade,
Alise's assistant.
- Let me show you the way.
- Oh, great.
- Hi.
- Hello. Hi. Jamie.
- Jamie Wellerstein.
- Alise Michaels.
It is an absolute pleasure
to meet you.
- Wow, this is great.
- Have a seat.
Would you like a glass of water?
Yes. Thank you so much
for having me.
Everyone in the office
is absolutely thrilled to meet you.
Everybody has been so nice,
from just walking in the door.
- Everyone's a huge fan of the book.
- This is beautiful.
- I've never even been this high up.
- It's a great office. Yes, thank you.
That's great.
Thank you.
One day we 're <i>just like</i>
Leave It To Beaver
<i>One day it's just a typical life</i>
<i>And then he's off on
a trip to Jamie-land</i>
<i>Staring catatonic out the window</i>
<i>Barely even breathing
all the while</i>
<i>And then he'll smile</i>
<i>His eyes light up
and deep within the ground</i>
<i>Without a sound</i>
<i>A moment comes to life</i>
<i>And Pm a part of that</i>
<i>I'm a part of that</i>
<i>Next day it's just like
it never happened</i>
<i>We're making dinners</i>
<i>We're making plans</i>
<i>Then he gets on the
mule train to Jamie-land</i>
<i>Handful after handful
of Doritos</i>
<i>Circling the apartment,
Logging miles</i>
<i>And then he smiles</i>
<i>His eyes light up
And how can I complain'?</i>
<i>Yes, he's insane</i>
<i>But look what he can do</i>
<i>And I'm a part of that</i>
<i>I'm a part of that</i>
<i>And it's true</i>
<i>I tend to follow in his stride</i>
<i>instead of side by side</i>
<i>I take his cue</i>
<i>True</i>
<i>But there's no question,
there's no doubt</i>
<i>I said I'd stick it out</i>
<i>And follow through</i>
<i>And when I do</i>
<i>Then he smiles</i>
<i>And where else can I go?</i>
<i>I didn't know</i>
<i>The rules do not apply</i>
<i>And then he smiles</i>
<i>And nothing else makes sense</i>
<i>While he invents</i>
<i>The world that's passing by</i>
<i>And Pm a part of that</i>
<i>I'm a part of that</i>
<i>I'm a part of that</i>
<i>Aren't I?</i>
<i>I'm a part of that</i>
Hey.
How are you doing, babe?
You did...
Not a very good day
at the bar, huh?
I'm sorry. Did you at least,
uh, get some good tips?
Get any, uh...
- Shit!
- Oh.
You look really nice.
Hey, uh, are you working
on anything tonight?
- Like what?
- You know, your photos? The dress?
Like... Don't you have
an audition or something
later this week that
you need to get ready for?
- I'm not going.
- Why?
Because, I'm not going to get it.
Oh, come on, did you call
your agent or anything?
- He's on a retreat.
- Retreat?
What the hell is an agent retreat?
I don't know. They go into the woods
and sacrifice actresses
to breed more agents.
That's frightening, Cathy.
I don't make them do it.
Hey, no, look, I have prepared
a little surprise for you
in the form of the story.
- No, baby, please.
- Come on.
- No, I've had such a shitty day.
- No, listen...
I've literally been doing this for hours,
so you're going to sit up
for, like, five minutes and listen, OK?
You know, if I had known
there were going to be this many stories,
- I wouldn't have ever dated a writer.
- Well, too late.
You're going
to like it. I promise.
It's a Christmas story.
You like Christmas.
I call it the Story of Schmuel,
the Tailor of Klimovich.
<i>Schmuel would work
till half-past ten</i>
<i>At his tailor shop in Klimovich</i>
<i>Get up at dawn and start again</i>
<i>With the hems
and pins and twist</i>
Are you going to touch my dress right now?
<i>Forty-one years had come and gone</i>
<i>At his tailor shop in Klimovich</i>
<i>Watching the winters soldier on</i>
<i>There was one thing</i>
<i>Schmuel missed</i>
Are you ready for this?
<i>If I only had time"
old Schmuel said</i>
<i>"I would build
the dress that's in my head</i>
<i>A dress to fire the mad desire</i>
<i>Of girls from here to Minsk</i>
<i>But I have no more hours
left to sew"</i>
<i>Then the clock upon the wall
began to glow</i>
<i>And the clock said</i>
<i>"Na na na na, na na na</i>
<i>Oh, Schmuel
you'll get to be happy</i>
<i>Na na na na, na na na
I give you unlimited time”</i>
- It's a magical clock.
- I've never been more attracted to you.
<i>"So Schmuel
Go sew and be happy"</i>
<i>But Schmuel said
”No, no, it's not my lot</i>
<i>I've gotta make do
with the time We got</i>
Oh, look at the time.
It's time to go.
Here we go.
Why do all my things
have to come into this?
<i>Schmuel was done
at half-past ten</i>
<i>And he said
"Good night, old Klimovich"</i>
<i>Put on his coat to go But then</i>
<i>The clock cried
'Wait! Not yet”</i>
Pretty good, right?
<i>"Even though
you're not wise or rich</i>
<i>You're the finest man
in Klimovich</i>
<i>Listen up, Schmuel
Make one stitch</i>
<i>And you'll see what you get"</i>
<i>But Schmuel said
"Clock, it's much too late</i>
<i>I'm at peace with life
I accept my fate"</i>
<i>But the clock said "Schmuel!
One stitch and you will</i>
<i>Unlock the dreams you've lost"</i>
<i>So Schmuel, with reluctance,
took his thread</i>
<i>He pulled a bolt of velvet
and he said</i>
<i>"I should take out my teeth
and go to bed</i>
<i>I'm sitting here
with talking clocks</i>
<i>Instead"</i>
<i>And the clock said
"Na na na na, na na na</i>
<i>Oh, Schmuel
you'll get to be happy”</i>
And then they dance.
Na na na na, na na na
No. No, thank you.
Come on!
Na na na na, na na na
<i>"Just do it
and you can be happy”</i>
<i>So Schmuel put the thread
through the needles eye</i>
<i>And the moon stared down
from a starless sky</i>
<i>And he pushed the thread
through the velvet black</i>
<i>And he looked, and the clock
was turning back</i>
<i>So he grabbed his shears
and he cut some lace</i>
<i>As the hands reversed
on the old clock's face</i>
<i>And his fingers ﬂew
and the fabric swirled</i>
<i>It was 9:15
all around the world</i>
<i>Every out and stitch
was a perfect fit</i>
<i>As if God Himself
were controlling it</i>
<i>And Schmuel cried
through a rush of tears</i>
<i>"Take me back</i>
<i>Take me back all 41 years"</i>
<i>And on it went</i>
<i>Down that silent street</i>
<i>Till Schmuel's dress</i>
<i>Was at last complete</i>
<i>And he stretched his arms</i>
<i>And he closed his eyes</i>
<i>And the morning sun</i>
<i>Finally started</i>
<i>To rise</i>
<i>And the dress he made
on that endless night</i>
<i>Was a dress that would make
any soul take ﬂight</i>
<i>Not a swatch, not a skein
had gone to waste</i>
<i>Every ribbon and button
ideally placed</i>
<i>And sewn into the seams</i>
<i>Were 41 seasons of dreams</i>
<i>Dreams that you could feel</i>
<i>Coming real</i>
Come on.
<i>And that very dress
so the papers swore</i>
<i>Was the dress a girl
in Odessa wore</i>
<i>On the day she promised
forevermore</i>
<i>To love</i> a <i>young man</i>
named <i>Schmuel</i>
<i>Who only one day before</i>
<i>Had knocked at her kitchen door</i>
Thank you.
That was pretty long, but it was fun.
Oh, it's not over yet.
<i>Plenty have hoped
and dreamed and prayed</i>
<i>But they can't get out of Klimovich</i>
<i>If Schmuel had been
a cute goyishe maid</i>
<i>He'd have looked a lot like you</i>
- Sorry, I'm Schmuel in this story!?
- Oh, yeah.
I'm not the girl from Odessa?
<i>Maybe it's just that
you're afraid to go out</i>
<i>On to a limb... ovich</i>
Uh...
<i>Maybe your heart's completely swayed</i>
<i>But your head
can't follow through</i>
<i>But shouldn't I want
the world to see</i>
<i>The brilliant girl
who inspires me?</i>
<i>Don't you think that
now's a good time to be</i>
<i>The ambitious freak you are?</i>
<i>Say goodbye to wiping
ashtrays at the bar</i>
Come on.
<i>Say hello to Cathy Hiatt</i>
<i>A big-time star</i>
Ah!
<i>'Cause I say</i>
<i>"Na na na na, na na na na</i>
<i>Cathy, you get to be happy</i>
<i>Na na na na, na na na
I give you unlimited time</i>
<i>Na na na na na na na
Stop temping and go, go be happy"</i>
<i>Here's</i> a <i>headshot guy
and</i> a <i>new</i> Backstage
<i>Where you're right for
something on every page</i>
<i>Take a breath Take a step</i>
<i>Take a chance</i>
<i>Take your time</i>
<i>Have I mentioned today</i>
<i>How lucky I am</i>
<i>To be in love</i>
<i>With you</i>
<i>Hi.</i>
<i>I could have a mansion
on a hill</i>
<i>I could lease a villa
in Seville</i>
<i>But it wouldn't be as nice
as a summer in Ohio</i>
<i>With a gay midget named Karl</i>
<i>Playing Tevye and Porgy</i>
God... Wow.
<i>I could wander Paris after dark</i>
<i>Take a carriage ride
through Central Park</i>
<i>But it wouldn't be as nice
as a summer in Ohio</i>
<i>Where I'm sharing a room
with a former stripper and her snake</i>
- I love you.
- Wayne.
Oh, my God!
<i>I could have a satchel</i>
<i>Full of dollar bills</i>
<i>Cures for all the nation's ills</i>
Oh!
<i>Pills to make a lion purr</i>
<i>I could be in line
to be the British queen</i>
<i>Look like I was 17</i>
Wow.
<i>Still I'm certain I'd prefer</i>
<i>To be going slowly batty</i>
<i>Forty miles east of Cincinnati</i>
<i>I could shove an ice pick
in my eye</i>
<i>I could eat some fish
from last July</i>
<i>But it wouldn't be as awful
as a summer in Ohio</i>
<i>Without cable, hot water</i>
<i>Vietnamese food or you</i>
Oh, baby, I love you.
<i>I saw your book at a Target</i>
<i>In Kentucky under a sign that said
"new and recommended"</i>
<i>I stole</i> a <i>look at your
picture on the inside sleeve</i>
<i>And then I couldn't leave</i>
<i>Richard, who was with me
got uncharacteristically quiet</i>
<i>And he said, "All things considered,
I guess you don't have to buy it”</i>
<i>So I smile like Mona Lisa
and I lay my Visa down</i>
<i>He wants me He wants me</i>
<i>But he ain't gonna get me</i>
Damn right!
<i>I've found my guiding light</i>
<i>I tell the stars each night</i>
<i>Look at me Look at him</i>
<i>Son of a bitch,
I guess Pm doing something right</i>
<i>I finally got something right</i>
<i>No, it's not Nirvana
but it's on the way</i>
<i>I play Anita at the matinee</i>
<i>Then H! get on my knees and pray</i>
<i>I can state in my next bio</i>
<i>I'm never gonna go back to Ohio</i>
<i>I could chew on tin foil for a spell</i>
<i>I could get</i> a <i>root</i> canal <i>in hell</i>
<i>But it wouldn't be as swell</i>
<i>As this summer is gonna be</i>
<i>'Cause the torture is just exquisite</i>
<i>While Fm waiting for you to visit</i>
<i>So hurry up, schmuck</i>
<i>Get unstuck
and get on the scene</i>
<i>Love the midget, the stripper,</i>
<i>Wayne the snake
and Mrs. Jamie Wellerstein</i>
<i>That's me</i>
<i>No, that one's
Jerry Seinfeld</i>
<i>That one's John Lennon there</i>
<i>No, the Dakota</i>
<i>The San Remo is up a few blocks</i>
<i>Have you been
inside the museum?</i>
<i>We should go</i>
<i>Meet the dinosaurs</i>
<i>Cathy</i>
<i>Will you share
your life with me</i>
<i>For the next ten minutes?</i>
<i>For the next ten minutes</i>
<i>We can handle that</i>
<i>We could watch the waves</i>
<i>We could watch the sky</i>
<i>Or just sit and wait</i>
<i>As the time ticks by</i>
<i>And if we make it til! then</i>
<i>Could I ask you again</i>
<i>For another ten?</i>
<i>And if you in turn agree</i>
<i>To the next ten minutes</i>
<i>And the next ten minutes</i>
<i>Till the morning comes</i>
<i>Then just holding you</i>
<i>Might compel me to</i>
<i>Ask you for more</i>
<i>There are so many lives
I want to share with you</i>
<i>I will never be complete</i>
<i>Until I do</i>
<i>I am not always on time</i>
<i>Please don't expect that from me</i>
<i>I will be late
But if you can just wait</i>
<i>I will make it eventually</i>
<i>Not like it's in my control</i>
<i>Not like I'm proud of the fact</i>
<i>But anything other than
being exactly on time</i>
<i>I can do</i>
<i>I don't know why people run</i>
<i>I don't know why
things fall through</i>
<i>I don't know how anybody
survives in this life</i>
<i>Without someone like you</i>
<i>I could protect and preserve</i>
<i>I could say no and goodbye</i>
<i>But why, Jamie?</i>
<i>Why?</i>
<i>I want to be your wife</i>
<i>I want to bear your child</i>
<i>I want to die, knowing I</i>
<i>Had a long, full life</i>
<i>in your arms</i>
<i>That I can do</i>
<i>- Forever, with you
- Will you share your life with me?</i>
- <i>Forever</i>
- <i>For the next ten lifetimes?</i>
- <i>Forever, Jamie</i>
- <i>For</i> a <i>million summers?</i>
<i>Till the world explodes</i>
<i>Till there's no one left</i>
<i>Who has ever known us apart</i>
<i>There are so many dreams
I need to see with you</i>
<i>There are so many years
I need to be with you</i>
<i>I will never be complete</i>
<i>I will never be alive</i>
<i>I will never change the world</i>
<i>Until I do</i>
<i>do</i>
<i>I</i>
<i>Do</i>
<i>Is that one
John Lennon?</i>
<i>That's the San Remo?</i>
<i>Isn't that the museum?</i>
<i>Can we go see the dinosaurs?</i>
Thank you.
Are you kidding me?
<i>Everyone tells you that
the minute you get married</i>
<i>Every other woman in the world
suddenly finds you attractive</i>
<i>Well, that's not true</i>
<i>It only affects the kind of women
you always wanted to sleep with</i>
<i>But they wouldn't give you
the time of day before</i>
<i>And now they're banging down your door,
and falling to their knees</i>
<i>At least that's what it feels like
because you can not touch them!</i>
<i>In fact, you can't
even look at them</i>
<i>Close your eyes Close your eyes</i>
<i>Close your eyes</i>
<i>Except you're sitting there
eating your corned beef sandwich</i>
<i>And all of a sudden,
this pair of breasts walks by</i>
<i>And smiles at you
and you're like,</i>
<i>"That's not fair"</i>
<i>And in a perfect world</i>
<i>A miracle would happen</i>
<i>And every other girl
would ﬂy away</i>
<i>And it'd be me and Cathy
and nothing else would matter</i>
<i>But it's fine, it's fine,
it's fine, I mean, I'm happy</i>
<i>And I'm fine, I'm fine
I'm fine, it's not a problem</i>
<i>It's just a challenge
It's a challenge to resist</i>
<i>Temptation</i>
<i>And I have to say that
what exacerbates the problem</i>
<i>ls I'm at these parties
I'm the center of attention</i>
<i>I'm the grand fromage
And here she comes</i>
<i>"Let's get a cup of coffee
Will you look at my manuscript?"</i>
<i>And I'm showing her my left hand,
I'm gesticulating with my left hand</i>
<i>And then, whoa! There's Cathy!
Because she knows, they always know</i>
<i>And there's that really awkward moment</i>
<i>Where I try to show
I wasn't encouraging this</i>
<i>Which of course I was</i>
<i>And I don't want to look whipped
in front of this woman</i>
<i>Which is dumb, I shouldn't care what
she thinks since I can't touch her anyway!</i>
<i>And in a perfect world,
a miracle would happen</i>
<i>And every girl
would look like Mister Ed</i>
<i>And it'd be me and Cathy
and nothing else would matter</i>
<i>But it's fine, it's fine, it's fine
You know I love her</i>
<i>And it's fine, it's fine, it's fine
it's what I wanted</i>
<i>And I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine
It's not a problem</i>
<i>It's just a challenge
It's a challenge to resist</i>

Hi, Mr. Wellerstein.
I'll let Alise know you're here.
<i>When you come home to me</i>
<i>I'll wear a sweeter smile</i>
<i>And hope that,
for a while, you'll stay</i>
<i>When you come home to me</i>
<i>Your hand will touch my face</i>
<i>And banish any trace of gray</i>
<i>Soon, a love will rise anew</i>
<i>Even greater than the joy I felt</i>
<i>Just missing you</i>
<i>And once again, H! be</i>
<i>So proud to call you mine</i>
<i>When finally you come home</i>
<i>To me</i>
- That was lovely.
- Really great.
- Thank you.
- Thank you. OK.
No, it went really, really well. Yeah.
No, I think I got it.
I mean, I hope. Yeah.
It's off Broadway, so...
Please, God, no more Ohio.
Um, I don't where I'm walking,
actually.
You have to come find me.
<i>I'll be there soon, Cathy</i>
<i>I'll finish up this chapter
and be out the door</i>
<i>I swear I'll be there soon, Cathy</i>
<i>Don't give up on me yet</i>
<i>I am so proud of you, baby</i>
<i>You're doing what you
never got to do before</i>
<i>And I will be there
ripe and crawling</i>
<i>If frigging Random House
stops calling</i>
<i>Don't lose faith Don't get down</i>
<i>Don't despair</i>
<i>I'll be there</i>
<i>And in a perfect world</i>
<i>A miracle would happen</i>
<i>And that day
would finally be here</i>
<i>And it'd be me and you</i>
<i>Riding it together</i>
<i>And the things we do
going like we planned</i>
<i>We're gonna make it through</i>
<i>And nothing else will matter</i>
<i>We'll be fine We're fine</i>
<i>We're fine We're fine</i>
<i>We're fine
We're fine, we're fine</i>
<i>I'll be there soon, Cathy</i>
<i>I swear I will</i>
<i>When you come home to me</i>
<i>I'll wear a sweeter smile</i>
<i>And hope that
for</i> a <i>while you'll...</i>
OK. Thank you.
<i>I'm climbing uphill, Jamie</i>
<i>Climbing uphill</i>
<i>I'm up every morning at six</i>
<i>And standing in line with 200 girls</i>
<i>Who are younger
and thinner than me</i>
<i>Who have already
been to the gym</i>
<i>I'm waiting five hours in line</i>
<i>And watching the girls
just coming and going</i>
<i>In dresses that
look just like this</i>
Cathy Hiatt.
<i>Until my number
is finally called</i>
<i>When I walk in the room,
there's a table of men</i>
<i>Always men, usually gay</i>
<i>Who've been sitting like I have
and listening ail day</i>
<i>To 200 girls
belting as high as they can</i>
<i>I am a good person</i>
<i>I'm an attractive person</i>
<i>I am a talented person</i>
<i>Grant me grace</i>
<i>When you come home</i>
<i>I should have told them
I was sick last week</i>
<i>They're gonna think
this is the way I sing</i>
<i>Why is the pianist
playing so loud'?</i>
<i>Should I sing louder?
I'll sing louder</i>
<i>Maybe I should stop
and start over</i>
<i>I'm gonna stop and start over</i>
<i>Why is the director staring
at his crotch?</i>
<i>Why is that man staring
at my resume?</i>
<i>Don't stare at my resume</i>
<i>I made up half of my resume
Look at me</i>
<i>Stop looking at that Look at me</i>
<i>No, not at my shoes
Don't look at my shoes</i>
<i>I hate these stupid shoes</i>
<i>Why did I pick these shoes</i>
<i>Why did I pick this song?</i>
<i>Why did I pick this career?</i>
<i>Why?</i>
<i>Does this pianist hate me?</i>
<i>If' I don't get a callback</i>
<i>I can go to Crate and Barrel
with mom and buy a couch</i>
<i>Not that I want to spend
a day with mom</i>
<i>But Jamie needs space to write</i>
<i>Since I'm obviously
such</i> a <i>horrible</i>
<i>Annoying distraction to him</i>
<i>What's he gonna
be like when we have kids?</i>
<i>And once again</i>
<i>Why am I working so hard?</i>
<i>These are the people who cast
Russell Crowe in</i> a <i>musical</i>
<i>Jesus Christ, I suck
I suck, I suck</i>
<i>When finally you come home...</i>
Thanks. That's great.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you. Thanks very much.
"He touched the wall
and decided he had had enough.
He was exhausted, first of all,
and he could feel it:
his lungs were throbbing
and heavy,
and his left arm was stinging
from the shoulder right down to his wrist.
Besides that, seven laps in
and the water was still freezing cold,
and if he wanted to be honest
about it, he felt foolish.
A ghost-pale graceless thing
flapping about frantically,
desperately trying to keep pace
with the mermaid in the next lane.
He watched her.
He watched her back stretching,
watched how she seemed
to ride the water.
He didn't recognize the
fierceness in her brow..."
<i>I will not be the girl stuck
at home in the 'burbs</i>
<i>With the baby, the dog
and a garden of herbs</i>
<i>I will not be the girl
in the sensible shoes</i>
<i>Pushing burgers and beer nuts
and missing the clues</i>
<i>I will not be the girl

"He recognized her...
'I see you.'
Her clenched jaw,
her sharp turns away from him.
'You don't have to let me win, '
she had been screaming,
but he couldn't hear it at all."
- Ouch.
- I'm so proud of you!
Beautiful.
From Random House, David.
- Oh, David.
- And Kathryn Marrow.
And this is his agent,
Mrs. Whitfield.
Hello. A pleasure to meet you.
Hello, hello. A pleasure to meet you.
Wasn't he wonderful?
And I've been to every
one of them. I've been to so many.
And the same thing happens, I'm basically
your waitress for the evening,
I'm bringing you drinks.
I get asked if I'm your publicist,
because everybody asks me
to take pictures of you on their phone,
and these people, they ask me
the same things every time.
"How did you and Jamie meet?
What's Jamie like?"
Baby, I'm so sorry they
ask you the same questions.
No one would notice if I didn't go.
You beg me to go and you abandon me
and I stand by the bar all night
and I'm drinking!
I'm holding my purse and I'm waiting
for somebody to come talk to me.
- You certainly don't talk to me!
- Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
God, just stop and listen to me!
Can we just, for, like, two minutes,
have a conversation without you
contradicting everything I say?
Two minutes!
And then fine, you can
say whatever you want.
<i>OK, look, there are people...</i>
<i>And they are
publishing my book.</i>
<i>And there's a party
that they are throwing.</i>
<i>And while you've made it very
clear that you're not going,</i>
<i>I will be going.</i>
<i>And that's done.</i>
<i>But what's it really about?</i>
<i>Is it really about a party, Cathy?</i>
<i>Can we please,
for a minute, stop blaming</i>
<i>And say what you feel?</i>
<i>Is it just that you're disappointed</i>
<i>To be going again to Ohio?</i>
<i>Did you think
this would all be much easier</i>
<i>Than it's turned out to be?</i>
<i>Well, then talk to me, Cathy</i>
<i>Talk to me</i>
<i>If' I didn't believe in you</i>
<i>We'd never have gotten this far</i>
<i>If I didn't believe in you</i>
<i>And all of the 10,000 women you are</i>
<i>If I didn't think you could do</i>
<i>Anything you ever wanted to</i>
<i>If I wasn't certain
that you'd come through somehow</i>
<i>The fact of the matter is, Cathy</i>
<i>I wouldn't be standing here now</i>
<i>If I didn't believe in you</i>
<i>We wouldn't be having this fight</i>
<i>If I didn't believe in you</i>
<i>I'd walk out the door
and say, 'Cathy, you're right"</i>
<i>But I never could let that go</i>
<i>Knowing the things
about you I know</i>
<i>Things, when I met you
four years ago</i>
<i>I knew</i>
<i>it never took much convincing</i>
<i>To make me believe in you</i>
<i>Don't we get to be happy, Cathy?</i>
<i>At some point down the line</i>
<i>Don't we get to relax</i>
<i>Without some new tsuris</i>
<i>To push me
yet further from you?</i>
<i>And if I'm cheering
on your side, Cathy</i>
<i>Why can't you support mine?</i>
<i>Why do I have to feel
I've committed some felony</i>
<i>Doing what I always swore
I would do?</i>
<i>I don't want you to hurt</i>
Hey, hey.
<i>I don't want you to sink</i>
<i>But you know what I think?</i>
<i>I think you'll be fine</i>
<i>Just hang on and you?! see</i>
<i>But don't make me wait till you do
to be happy with you</i>
<i>Will you listen to me?</i>
<i>No one can give you courage</i>
<i>No one can thicken your skin</i>
<i>I will not fail
so you can be comfortable, Cathy</i>
<i>I will not lose
because you can't win</i>
<i>If I didn't believe in you</i>
<i>And, and here's where
the travelogue ends</i>
<i>If I didn't believe in you</i>
<i>I couldn't have stood
before all of our friends</i>
<i>And said
"This is the life I choose</i>
<i>This is the thing
I can't bear to Jose</i>
<i>Trip us or trap us
but we refuse to fall"</i>
<i>That's what I thought
we agreed on</i>
<i>Cathy</i>
<i>If I hadn't believed in you</i>
<i>I wouldn't have loved you at all</i>
Baby.
Baby, just... just
please, put on your dress,
and we'll go
to this stupid party.
And we... Can you just do
that for me, Cathy, please?
Cathy? Where are you going?
Cathy? Cathy?!
Cathy! Stop!
Uh, you know
they're gonna love me.
I'm sure they will.
Come on.
Hello, Mr. Hiatt.
Uh, may I please have pre-marital sex
with your daughter? Thank you.
Oh, my God!
<i>My best friend
had</i> a <i>little situation</i>
<i>At the end of our senior year</i>
<i>And like a shot she and Mitchell
got married that summer</i>
Ugh.
<i>Carol Ann getting bigger
every minute</i>
<i>Thinking "What am 1 doing here?"</i>
<i>While Mitchell's out every night
being a heavy-metal drummer</i>
<i>They got a little cute house
on a little cute street</i>
<i>With a crucifix on the door</i>
<i>Mitchell got a job
at a record store in the mall</i>
<i>Just the typical facts
of a typical life</i>
<i>In a town on the Eastern Shore</i>
<i>I thought about what I wanted</i>
<i>It wasn't like that at all</i>
<i>Made Carol Ann
a cute baby sweater</i>
<i>Thinking I can do
better than that</i>
- Ow!
- Please just drive. Please just drive!
<i>In a year or so
I moved to the city</i>
<i>Thinking
"What have I got to lose?"</i>
<i>Got a room, got a cat
and got 20 pounds thinner</i>
<i>Met a guy in a class I was taking
with some very welt placed tattoos</i>
<i>He wouldn't leave me alone
'less I went with him to dinner</i>
<i>And I guess he was cute
and I guess he was sweet</i>
<i>And I guess he was good in bed</i>
<i>I gave up my life
for a better part of a year</i>
<i>So I'm starting to think
that this maybe might work</i>
<i>And the second
it entered my head</i>
<i>He needed to take some time off</i>
<i>Focus on his career</i>
<i>He blew me off
with a heartfelt letter</i>
<i>I thought, "I can do
better than that"</i>
<i>You don't have to get a haircut</i>
<i>You don't have to
change your shoes</i>
<i>You don't have to
like Duran Duran</i>
Just one song!
<i>Just love me</i>
<i>You don't have to
put the seat down</i>
<i>You don't have to
watch the news</i>
<i>You don't have to
learn to tango</i>
<i>You don't have to
eat prosciutto</i>
<i>You don't have to
change a thing</i>
<i>Just stay with me</i>
<i>I want you and you
and nothing but you</i>
<i>Miles and piles of you</i>
<i>Finally, I'll have
something worthwhile</i>
<i>To think of each morning</i>
<i>You and you and nothing but you</i>
<i>No substitution will do</i>
<i>Nothing but fresh
undiluted and pure</i>
<i>Top of the line</i>
<i>And totally mine</i>
<i>I don't need any
lifetime commitments</i>
<i>I don't need to get
hitched tonight</i>
<i>I don't want you to throw up
all your walls and defenses</i>
<i>I don't mean to
put on any pressure</i>
<i>But I know
when a thing is right</i>
<i>And I spend every day
reconfiguring my senses</i>
<i>When we get to my house
take a look at that town</i>
<i>Take</i> a <i>look at how far I've gone</i>
<i>I will never go back
Never look back anymore</i>
<i>And it feels like my life
led right to your side</i>
<i>And will keep me there
from now on</i>
<i>Think about what you wanted</i>
<i>Think about what could be</i>
<i>Think about how I love you</i>
<i>And say you'll move in with me</i>
<i>Think of what's great
about me and you</i>
<i>Think of the bullshit
we've both been through</i>
<i>Think of what's past
because we can do better</i>
<i>We can do better</i>
<i>We can do better than that</i>
<i>We can do better than that</i>
<i>Hey, kid</i>
<i>Good morning</i>
<i>You look like an angel</i>
<i>I don't remember</i>
<i>When we fell asleep</i>
<i>We should get up, kid</i>
<i>Cathy is waiting</i>
<i>Look at us, lying here</i>
<i>Dreaming, pretending</i>
<i>I made a promise</i>
<i>And I took a vow</i>
<i>I wrote a story</i>
<i>And we changed the ending</i>
<i>Cathy, just look at me now</i>
<i>Hold on</i>
<i>Facts are facts</i>
<i>Just relax</i>
<i>Lay low</i>
<i>All right</i>
<i>The panic recedes</i>
<i>Nobody needs</i>
<i>To know</i>
<i>Hmm</i>
<i>Put on my armor</i>
<i>I'm off to Ohio</i>
<i>Back into battle</i>
<i>Till I don't know when</i>
<i>Swearing to her that I</i>
<i>Never was with you</i>
<i>And praying</i>
<i>I'll hold you again</i>
<i>Hold on</i>
<i>Clip these wings</i>
<i>Things get out of hand</i>
<i>All right</i>
<i>It's over It's done</i>
<i>No one will understand</i>
<i>No one will understand</i>
<i>We build a tree house</i>
<i>I keep it from shaking</i>
<i>Little more glue
every time that it breaks</i>
<i>Perfectly balanced</i>
<i>And then I start making</i>
<i>The conscious</i>
<i>Deliberate mistakes</i>
<i>All that I ask for</i>
<i>ls one little corner</i>
<i>One private room</i>
<i>At the back of my heart</i>
<i>Tell her I found one</i>
<i>She sends out battalions</i>
<i>To claim it</i>
<i>And blow it apart</i>
<i>I grip and she grips</i>
<i>And faster we 're sliding</i>
<i>Sliding and spilling</i>
<i>And what can I do?</i>
<i>Come back to bed, kid</i>
<i>Take me inside you</i>
<i>I promise</i>
<i>I won't lie to you</i>
<i>Hold on</i>
<i>Don't cry yet</i>
<i>I won't let you go</i>
<i>All right</i>
<i>The panic recedes</i>
<i>All right</i>
<i>Everyone bleeds</i>
<i>All right</i>
<i>I get what I need</i>
<i>And nobody needs</i>
<i>To know</i>
<i>Nobody needs</i>
<i>To know</i>
<i>And since I have to be
in love with someone</i>
<i>Since I need to be
in love with someone</i>
<i>Maybe I could be
in love with someone</i>
<i>Like you</i>
<i>Don't kiss me goodbye again</i>
<i>Leave this night
clean and quiet</i>
<i>You want the last word</i>
<i>You want me to laugh</i>
<i>But leave it for now</i>
<i>All you can say
All you can feel</i>
<i>Was wrapped up inside
that one perfect kiss</i>
<i>Leave it at that</i>
<i>I'll watch you tum
the corner and go</i>
<i>And goodbye until tomorrow</i>
<i>Goodbye until
the next time you call</i>
<i>And I will be waiting</i>
<i>I will be waiting</i>
<i>Goodbye until tomorrow</i>
<i>Goodbye till
I recall how to breathe</i>
<i>And I have been waiting</i>
<i>I have been waiting for you</i>
<i>I stand on a precipice</i>
<i>I struggle to keep my balance</i>
<i>I open myself</i>
<i>I open myself
one stitch at a time</i>
<i>Finally yes Finally now</i>
<i>Finally something takes me away</i>
<i>Finally free</i>
<i>Finally he can cut
through these strings</i>
<i>And open my wings</i>
<i>So goodbye until tomorrow</i>
<i>Goodbye until my feet
touch the ﬂoor</i>
<i>And I will be waiting
I will be waiting</i>
<i>Goodbye until tomorrow</i>
<i>Goodbye until
the rest of my life</i>
<i>And I have been waiting</i>
<i>I have been waiting for you</i>
<i>Waiting for you</i>
<i>I called Alise
to help</i> me <i>pack my bags</i>
<i>I went downtown
and closed the bank account</i>
<i>It's not about another shrink</i>
<i>It's not about
another compromise</i>
<i>I'm not the only one
who's hurting here</i>
<i>I don't know
what the hell is left to do</i>
<i>You never saw how far
the crack had opened</i>
<i>You never knew
I had run out of rope</i>
<i>And I could never rescue you</i>
<i>AH you ever wanted</i>
<i>But I could never rescue you</i>
<i>No matter how I tried</i>
<i>All I could do</i>
<i>Was love you hard</i>
<i>And let you go</i>
<i>No matter how I tried</i>
<i>All I could do</i>
<i>Was love you</i>
<i>God, I loved you so</i>
<i>So we could fight</i>
<i>Or we could wait</i>
- <i>Or I could go</i>
- <i>Goodbye until tomorrow</i>
<i>Goodbye until I crawl
to your door</i>
<i>And 1 will be waiting</i>
<i>I will be waiting</i>
<i>You never noticed
how the wind had changed</i>
<i>Goodbye until tomorrow</i>
<i>I didn't see a way
we both could win</i>
<i>Goodbye until
I'm done thanking God</i>
<i>And I have been waiting</i>
<i>I have been waiting for you</i>
<i>Goodbye, Cathy</i>
<i>I have been waiting</i>
<i>I have been waiting for you</i>
<i>Goodbye</i>
<i>I will keep waiting</i>
<i>I will keep waiting for you</i>
<i>Just close the gate</i>
<i>I'll stand and wait</i>
<i>Jamie</i>
- <i>Goodbye</i>
- <i>Goodbye</i>
