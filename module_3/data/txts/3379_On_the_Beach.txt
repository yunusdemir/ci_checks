Prepare to surface.
Depth to 58 feet.
Depth, 58 feet, sir.
Sonar, any contacts topside?
No contact, sir.
- Tank center ready to surface, sir.
- Very well.
Vents shut. Ready to surface, sir.
- Depth, 58 feet, sir.
- Very well.
Up periscope.
Point Lonsdale bearing, mark.
013, sir.
- Cape Schanck bearing, mark.
- 125, sir.
- How's the tide, Bob?
- High tide, sir.
Controls rigged for surfacing, sir.
Surface.
Surface, surface, surface.
- Blow main ballast.
- Main ballast blown.
- Depth 45 feet, sir.
- Secure the air.
Open main induction.
Main induction open, sir.
And our scientists disagree as to
when radiation will reach Australia.
The atomic war has ended,
but the Prime Minister reports
no proof of survival of human
life anywhere except here.
Navy department.
Congratulations.
Tea, dear.
I said, "Tea, dear."
Got a bit of a burn yesterday
at the beach after all.
You'd better put some
calamine stuff on it.
You did give Jennifer her bottle?
I laid out your white uniform.
Was that right?
I almost forgot I have to dash.
Peter?
They must be giving you
a ship of your own.
No, darling. They don't
give ships to lieutenants.
Then why would it be
Admiral Bridie himself?
If you were just to replace
someone who's ill or something,
that wouldn't mean seeing
Admiral Bridie, would it?
I don't know. You don't quite
know what to expect these days.
I'll pick up Jenny's milk on
the way home from the station.
Why do you have to pick it up?
They just won't be delivering
it anymore, I understand.
It's a beautiful day, Peter.
If I wheel Jennifer down
to the club after lunch,
could you meet me there for a swim?
Peter?
They just decided that yesterday.
If you're going to be in Melbourne
by 11:00, you'd better hurry.
So long, Charlie.
Hosgood?
- Hosgood!
- Yes, sir?
Have you seen this from
that idiot Attenborough?
- That great correlator of statistics.
- Yes, sir.
It's finally seeped down to him that
most of the oil in the world comes
from the northern hemisphere.
Attenborough says so.
It's now official.
We will carefully conserve the remaining
supplies of petrol in the depot.
Yes, sir.
Hosgood!
Lieutenant Holmes is here, sir.
Yes. Come in, come in.
Sit down. Sit down.
Thanks, sir.
I have an assignment for you.
Do you care for some
of this miserable muck
that passes for coffee these days?
No, thank you, sir.
It's a reasonably important
appointment, as things go these days.
That's getting to be quite a
phrase, isn't it? "These days."
- You find yourself using it?
- Yes, sir. I'm afraid I do.
I'm sorry it can't be
one of our own ships.
It's seagoing though and better
than sitting around on your bottom.
Liaison officer aboard the
American submarine, Sawfish.
She just docked.
Nuclear-powered, of course.
- You know about her?
- Yes, sir. I read the report.
She's at our disposal for cruise.
Reconnaissance or whatever
you care to call it.
You'll sail soon, but just when or where
or for how long, I can't tell you,
not until the government
and a pack of these longhaired
scientists sort themselves out.
She's moored across the dock
from the carrier Melbourne
in Williamstown.
You'll report to the
Captain Towers.
That will be all, Holmes.
Sir, would it be possible to discuss
the duration of this appointment?
No.
But I can give you a
review in four months.
Thanks very much, sir, because I'd
like to be home if possible when...
ls there any official estimate
as to how much longer?
The beaker-heads, the
finger-in-the-wind boys say,
calculating the rate of drift
or what have you, about five
months before it gets here.
That's why I say four for review.
There's transport leaving for
Williamstown, if you care to take that.
Yes, sir.
Hosgood, where is this
coffee coming from?
Supply says it's the best
they can do these days, sir.
- Shall I query them again?
- No, no, no. It doesn't matter.
You have anything
important to do, Hosgood?
No, sir. What is it?
Nothing. I just thought you might
like to take yourself off till Monday,
a fine weekend.
Boyfriend or whatever.
No, I... I guess not.
I'll be here, sir.
All watches of seamen fall
in on the cargo deck.
Rob.
Lieutenant Holmes will be coming aboard
Monday and off and on until we sail.
Better have Benson issue him
what clothing he'll need.
Yes, sir.
- I'll see you Monday, Lieutenant.
- Thanks.
It's funny.
Somehow I get the feeling they're
putting her in mothballs.
Sir?
I'm afraid I'll have to bunk
you with this scientist fellow
who's coming aboard
from the C.S.I.R.
Sorry, I don't know who
he'll be just yet.
That's all right, sir. I'll manage.
Care for a drink before lunch?
Yes, sir, if it's all right.
It's Australian country
in the flattop,
I'll have to stick to Coke.
You have whatever you like.
I'm a bit puzzled about this cruise,
sir. Our destination, I mean.
Admiral Bridie seems
a bit indefinite.
Of course, if there's some
reason I shouldn't know...
No, there's no reason
why you shouldn't know.
But outside of the fact
that it's reconnaissance,
I don't know any more
about it than you do.
Of course, the crew has it all down pat.
We're sailing the end of next week.
We're going north, and we'll
be back in two months.
But I'll let you know as soon as
I hear anything more official.
Do you live in Melbourne?
Just outside, actually,
in Frankston.
That's three-quarters of
an hour by electric train.
You make out all right?
Any serious shortages yet?
Yes, a few, petrol mainly.
But we manage, you know.
Say,
I've been sticking pretty
close here lately.
Think I'm due for some shore food.
You know of a place where
we might get a good steak?
Yes, I suppose so.
The Admiral fixed me up
with a temporary card
for something called the
Pastoral Club. What's that like?
It's a mahogany and polished
brass sort of place.
Some people used to claim it was the
stuffiest club in the Commonwealth.
Of course, I suppose there's
no argument about that now.
Would they have any scotch left?
Yes, if anyone does.
My wife's uncle lives there, mostly
at the bar these days, I understand.
I would think they would
have some scotch, yes.
Sounds good.
Let's give it a try. I'll be
with you in five minutes.
Really, sometimes I think that
child could float a battleship.
That's what I told the Admiral.
Peter, how could you?
Well, I don't know, really. I just
held the towel like this and...
Very funny.
You're starting to get your
figure back, aren't you, Charlie?
You know, after Jennifer and all.
A little here, a little there.
By the way, I invited Captain
Towers for the weekend.
- Peter, you didn't.
- I had to, really.
We had lunch together,
and he started asking questions
about how we live and all.
Mary, I would have looked an awful
clod not to have asked him.
- He'll be all right, I think.
- Was he married, do you know?
- Two kids.
- And they're gone?
Yes, they were in America.
Nappies flying in the
breeze, pablum everywhere,
they're bound to remind him.
We'll just try to get them
out of sight, that's all.
He'll get sodden and weep.
I can't stand that again, Peter.
He doesn't look the type to me.
- Your R.A.F. chum didn't either.
- Now, Mary...
What are we going to do with
him for two whole days?
Well, for one thing, I thought
a party on Saturday night.
Ten or 12 people. We haven't
done that for a while.
Would you like that?
As long as they all understand how I
feel about those morbid discussions.
We would have to get someone
for him, though, wouldn't we?
What about Moira?
Why not? If she's
sober this weekend.
Julian said she'd given it up.
No, darling, you didn't listen. Julian
said she'd given up gin for brandy.
She says she can drink more brandy.
Moira's not a bad notion, in point of fact.
She'd keep him occupied, at least.
But she'd have to stop over, and
we can't just put him on a cot.
Put Moira on a cot on the veranda.
She claims she's not slept in her own
bed the last three months anyway.
That's not entirely fair.
It's all on the surface.
I'll ring her up tonight
and give her the drill.
I wonder what he's like
when he gets a skinful.
- Peter.
- What?
You do understand how I feel,
I mean, about people talking?
Sure.
- And you do love me?
- Of course I do.
Then why don't you ever say so?
Give her what for, mate.
You're looking for me.
Am I?
I'm Moira Davidson. M-O-I-R-A.
It was a very fashionable
name in bad novels
when my mother was young
and impressionable.
I'm a throwback.
Where's Holmes?
He's decking the halls with holly.
He sent me for better or worse.
Better, I'd say.
I'm your date or
whatever you call it.
How'd you recognize me?
I love Americans. They're so naive.
This way, Commander.
A new model.
Only one horsepower, but she does a
good eight miles an hour on the flat.
- Quite a buggy.
- Over 70 years old.
Dad said she was made in America.
- I wouldn't be surprised.
- Give me your toothbrush.
Take Amelia's head while I see
if we can get us out of here.
She's still a wee bit
sticky in reverse.
All right, boy. Here we go.
Is there a place we might stop where
I could get a little breakfast?
- What?
- A little breakfast.
Do you mean that in addition
to everything else,
I have to watch you eat bacon
and eggs and all that muck?
I was on a party last night,
and I got up at 8:00 in
the morning to meet you.
- Well, I...
- Never mind. Hop in.
But you have to buy me a couple
drinks to get me started.
Incidentally, they didn't
tell me what to call you.
What's the protocol?
My name is Towers,
Dwight Lionel Towers.
- Really?
- Really.
Well, hang on, Dwight Lionel.
As a matter of fact, we've only
been in port for three days.
It's called the Sawfish.
My second husband was an American.
We traveled all over the world,
and everywhere we went,
he would say to people,
"I am an American.
I am an American."
They finally shot him in one
of those eastern countries.
I'm sorry.
I was too. He was such a
nice man while he lasted.
Is he yours, Moira?
On loan.
He just drinks and drinks
and nothing happens.
- At least he hasn't burst into tears.
- Keep up the good work.
That's sheer balderdash!
I never heard so much
nonsense in my life.
You mean to tell me this whole
damn war was an accident?
No, it wasn't an accident.
I didn't say that.
It was carefully planned,
down to the tiniest mechanical
and emotional detail.
But it was a mistake,
it was a beaut.
In the end, somehow granted
the time for examination,
we shall find that our so-called
civilization was gloriously destroyed
by a handful of vacuum
tubes and transistors.
Probably faulty.
There you are, Julian.
There you are.
Now we know where the
blame lies. Don't we?
No, you don't. No. No. No.
Maybe we were the blind
mechanics of disaster,
but you don't pin the guilt on
the scientists that easily.
You might as well pin
it on motherhood.
Well, it should be
pinned on somebody.
And you scientists are the likely
ones, as far as I can see.
You built the bomb.
You experimented with it,
tested it and exploded it.
- Now, just a moment, Morgan.
- Thanks to you chaps,
a moment is about all we have.
Every man who ever worked on this
thing told you what would happen.
The scientists signed petition
- after petition.
- Julian, please.
But nobody listened.
There was a choice. It was
build the bombs and use them,
or risk the United States,
the Soviet Union,
and the rest of us would find
some way to go on living.
That's wishful thinking,
if ever I heard it.
I'm not against wishful
thinking, not now.
Look, they pushed us too far.
They didn't think we'd fight,
no matter what they did.
And they were wrong. We fought.
We expunged them!
We didn't do such a
bad job on ourselves.
With the interesting result
that the background level
of radiation in this very room is
nine times what it was a year ago.
- Julian.
- Don't you know that?
Nine times! We're all
doomed, you know.
The whole silly, drunken,
pathetic lot of us.
Doomed by the air we're about to
breathe. We haven't got a chance!
Stop it! I won't have it, Julian!
I won't.
There is hope.
There has to be hope.
There's always hope.
We just can't go on like this.
We can't.
We... We...
I shouldn't drink, you know.
I inevitably say
something brilliant.
Sorry.
I can't help it, Peter.
I'm sorry.
I just can't.
Everybody's gone to bed.
You like that?
Settles the stomach.
I had a lot to drink.
I had a lot to drink.
Julian had a lot to drink.
Julian and I are the town drunks.
What are you trying to forget?
Well, it's a damn silly
question if I ever heard one.
Yeah, you're right.
It's just an expression.
You know, somebody should have given
me a copy of the local ground rules.
I might have opened my big mouth.
Danger struck from
the wrong quarter.
The people of the city
watch the wrong mousehole.
Come again?
But then, who would know you were
so tough and drank straight milk?
Where are you from? Which state?
- I'm from Idaho.
- Idaho?
I know better than that.
There's no navy in Idaho
because it's too hilly.
I was born in Idaho.
I live in Connecticut now.
Near New London, where I'm based.
Where were you during
all the whatchamacallit?
No.
I didn't mean to ask you
that. Peter said not to.
You don't have to answer.
I can't decide if I'm more
objectionable drunk or sober.
It's perfectly all right.
We were at sea
between Kiska and
Midway when it began.
We got orders to go
to the West Pacific,
and when we put our nose
up north of Iwo Jima,
the air was filled
with radioactive dust.
So we ducked.
Later on, took a look at Manila
through the periscope.
It was still too hot to surface, so
we came down the coast of Australia
and ended up here.
There wasn't much of
anyplace else to go.
- You look married.
- I am.
My wife's name is Sharon.
I have a couple of kids.
Richard, eight. Helen, five.
Dick is the real
sailor of the family.
He is going to go to Annapolis.
That's to be expected.
He'll probably change his mind.
Why is it taking so long?
Can you explain it to me?
Nobody can explain it to me.
And don't tell me about
those damn winds again.
How the northern hemisphere
and the southern hemisphere
get all mixed up and overlap.
I don't want to hear
about that anymore.
All I want to know is...
if everybody was so smart,
why didn't they know
what would happen?
They did.
Well, I... I can't take it.
I...
Yes, I can take it.
But it's unfair.
It's unfair because
I didn't do anything.
And nobody I know did anything.
Maybe I'm stupid.
I had to take algebra twice.
The only thing I could
understand was geography.
I like geography.
You know what I
always wanted to do?
I wanted to walk down
the Rue de Rivoli.
Have you ever been to
the Rue de Rivoli?
Yes.
I wanted to walk down
the Rue de Rivoli,
and I wanted to buy gloves.
I know the French
word for gloves...
No, you've got it all backwards.
What's that?
I was supposed to comfort you,
and you're comforting me.
I'm crying.
Everybody was so afraid
that you might cry.
- They were?
- Isn't that funny?
No.
Sometimes I do.
You better go to bed.
But you're in my bedroom.
I'll clear out.
Dwight.
Even if you don't like me,
would you please hold onto
me just for a moment longer?
This fellow Julian...
I take it that he's English and here
on some kind of scientific job.
What does he do, exactly?
I think Professor Jorgensen
should outline his plan
before we make a decision.
Simply stated, our view,
our strong opinion, is this,
that during the last winter
in the northern hemisphere,
rain and snow may have
washed the air, so to speak,
causing the radioactive elements to fall to
the ground more quickly than anticipated.
But the transfer of
radioactivity to us
would be progressively decreased,
and human life could go on here
or, at least in Antarctica...
That's clear enough,
Professor Jorgensen.
It's a hope.
We agree and the government agrees that
it's worth trying to find out, anyhow.
How far north could
a vessel proceed?
Our recommendation is that
the submarine should go
as far north in the
Pacific as possible,
to Point Barrow, and make the
necessary radioactivity readings.
The Prime Minister's
instruction, incidentally,
is the Sawfish be exposed to
as few dangers as possible.
Commander, how about
ice that far north?
She's no icebreaker.
We can feel our way.
I make it over 13,000
miles round trip.
Enough power in your reactor
for that, Commander?
I understand there's a considerable
stockpile of uranium here.
Enough for 10 trips like this.
Wish we had something
we could use it in.
You might try using it in my car.
Get a load of the Charlie Wheeler.
- May I be of assistance?
- Yes, I'm looking for Captain Towers.
I'll try to locate him for you.
Paulson, show the lady to Captain
Towers' cabin on the Melbourne.
- Thank you very much.
- It's a pleasure.
Right this way, please.
Relax.
Captain.
There's somebody to see you.
I asked her to wait
in your stateroom.
Hello.
A very nice man asked
me to wait here.
I don't think he knew
what to do with me.
That's debatable.
Did you ask me to visit
your submarine one day?
- No.
- I couldn't remember.
In the meantime,
I've been snooping.
Regular fish, these kids.
I'll have to get them a boat of
their own one of these days.
- Sit down.
- Thank you.
Here, have a cigarette.
Thank you.
I'm glad you came.
I just bet you are.
No, I am. Really.
And I'll just bet that my crew
didn't mind too much either.
Yes, I have a sneaking suspicion
they didn't mind at all.
Come in.
- I see they found you.
- Mr. Chrysler.
See if you can find Ms. Davidson
something she can wear
to go down in the
Sawfish, will you?
Yes, sir.
I take it you put me to bed.
Yes.
I arrived at that by deduction.
I asked Peter and Mary,
and they didn't.
I'm afraid I was a bit of a mess.
You drank too much brandy.
You passed out.
Yes, I've been drinking quite a bit
recently. That's no big secret.
But, you know, I...
I've never had it happen
quite like that before.
My obvious job was to seduce you.
So I suppose my pride is hurt.
I ought to feel ashamed.
Why did you bother about me?
There's a regulation
in here somewhere.
It's under "Shore duty."
- I'll read it to you.
- No, tell me.
It says when a young lady
has had so much to drink,
that she doesn't know
what she's doing,
you put her to bed
and go back to the ship.
- That's what it says?
- That's what it says.
Yes?
This requires quite a comprehensive
change. Are you sure about this?
You can't go down in a submarine
in that ballet costume.
I'll give you five minutes.
Unpack that one next,
please. That one.
- Everything under control, Mr. Osborn?
- I guess so.
Blasted idiots sent me
two wrong components.
I'll have to get them
replaced this afternoon.
As long as they're
right when we sail.
What on earth is he doing here?
Mr. Osborn's been assigned by the C.S.I.R.
to look after our health on the trip.
Health?
It's your submarine.
Captain, may I see
you a minute, sir?
Half a second.
Very becoming outfit.
You know, Julian,
they don't allow drinking
on American submarines.
I can't imagine what else you'd do.
Thanks very much.
What are you going to do?
Keep an eye on the weather.
Check on radiation.
I guess I'm sort of a
scientific cruise director.
Then it can be dangerous?
I wouldn't know, really.
A relative question
at best, isn't it?
It seems that everybody
I know is going.
I feel left out.
I can sing and dance.
You'll have to excuse me.
The Admiral is up top.
Don't you go away.
It's the damnedest thing. Started
the day before yesterday.
Came on again 10 minutes ago, sir.
Starts and stops. We've
monitored 60 hours so far.
It's weird. You're sure
it's from San Diego?
Within a 100-mile radius, sir.
It's as close as we're able to
pinpoint it without triangulation.
Could it be a kid, somebody
who doesn't know Morse?
We've made two words up to
now, sir. "Water" and "connect."
You know the old story about
an infinite number of monkeys
and an infinite number
of typewriters.
One of them has to end
up by writing King Lear.
I may be cracking up under the
strain, like everybody else,
but this interests me.
It's more than Jorgensen's
theory. It's a fact.
It's impossible, but it's a fact.
A radio signal is coming from around
San Diego, and they shouldn't be.
There shouldn't even be any
power for transmission.
- Hydroelectric?
- Yes, possibly.
There has to be an explanation for
it, and I'd like to know what it is.
Not that I'll live any
longer for knowing.
How would you like
to track it down?
- I'd like it, sir.
- Very well, then.
I've been onto our
electronic wizards.
They tell us you have
radio direction equipment
that can be used from
periscope depth.
- Is that correct?
- Yes. It hasn't been used much.
But I have to run some tests.
I'd like it to be in the pink.
Perhaps you can amuse yourself
around here a little longer,
until you're ready to leave.
What did you do that for?
We could have won.
They've had it.
Are they all right?
They're all right, but
they're out of the race.
It's like looking
at a French movie.
Dr. Fletcher?
What about these pills they've got,
whatever they are?
They'll be available from the
chemists' shops on the free list,
when the time comes.
I understand that they
have got them already
at Port Moresby and Darwin.
Apparently.
What's the effect?
Lethargy, then some euphoria, coma,
then nothing.
In fairly rapid order.
You...
You don't suppose you
could get me a couple?
And... Whatever it is for children?
Not a chance.
Until the time comes.
Sorry, Peter.
I'm beginning to twitch when
I hear the word "time."
If for some reason I'm not talking
about now, I'm just talking...
if there's one thing
you could do...
No. No, I know what I mean.
When the dentist is
drilling your tooth,
what do you think about?
The nicest thing? Sex? Or what?
Fishing.
Trout fishing in a
clean mountain stream.
You would.
Why not go then when you come back?
The season doesn't open
until September. I've asked.
You think I can't fix that?
You think I don't know
important people,
that I spend all my time with
this moldy suburban set?
You can't mean me. She never bottled
like that before. What happened?
She bottled us.
I was trying to win.
Taking the race too seriously, not
paying enough attention to her.
Truth is, he made a pass at me.
I had to go overboard
in self-defense.
Well, if that...
I do so much like to see the
young folks enjoying themselves.
What?
You never wrestle with me anymore.
What does that mean?
I mean exactly what I say. You
never wrestle with me anymore.
- All right.
- Peter, really.
- Well, I thought you said I never wrestle.
- Never mind... For now.
- Now, tell them the truth.
- But I told them the truth.
Sharon is the most
terrible liar that...
I think it's absolutely
preposterous.
How much of this Gould Campbell
have we got left, Stevens?
Better than 400 bottles, sir.
And in its prime.
Shocking. Shocking!
Four hundred bottles of
vintage port in the cellars
and barely five months to go.
Five months, mark you! If what
these scientist chaps say is right.
I think it needs another
year, actually.
I blame the wine committee very
much. Very much, indeed.
Should have had more foresight.
How can the members be expected to
get through 400 bottles of port
in five months' time?
Bad planning, I say.
Ridiculous.
I'll take another bottle
home with me today, Stevens.
Yes, sir.
Sir Douglas Froude is expecting me.
- I believe he's in the bar, sir.
- Thank you.
Yes, I've heard about those pills.
This cruise is developing into
something bigger than I thought.
I may not be here when it happens.
I understand, but if Dr. Fletcher
can't get them for you,
I'm not certain I can.
I've tried everything else.
You're my last hope.
You're convinced you want
Mary to have them now?
I've thought about it a great deal.
Yes, sir. Yes, I do.
I'm not certain you're right.
But considering Mary...
I don't know how much weight I carry
with the government in my old age.
There's a lot of bureaucracy
still, you know? Even in death.
But take this around anyway
and see what happens.
Thank you.
The wine committee is
mad, absolutely mad.
Four hundred bottles
of vintage port.
Too late. Too late.
Sorry, Dykers. Good show. Carry on.
As a matter of fact, the whole
thing is due to the wine committee
having failed to conserve
their supplies properly.
If they'd only regulated their...
How nice.
Have you noticed Moira isn't drinking
nearly so much? I wonder why.
No, I hadn't noticed.
Peter?
Could we afford an electric
mower for the lawn?
A very little one I could start
myself while you're away?
Doris Haymes has one.
She does.
She's cut the cord three times
and nearly electrocuted herself.
Besides, darling,
I doubt there's any left.
What's that?
Sit down, sit down.
This is something I want you
to know about before I go.
You're going to be serious?
I wish you wouldn't.
I wish I didn't have to be.
Now, darling, this is a big
cruise we're going on.
There will be mines and
ice to contend with.
Peter, I knew when I married you that
you were going to be a naval officer.
My father died at sea.
You know that.
We just don't have to
discuss it, do we?
We have to discuss this, Mary,
because there isn't any
tradition for this.
Peter...
And you're going to listen
whether you like it or not.
Now, this is a special kind of
sleeping pill.
I had a devil of a
time getting them,
but I wanted you to
have them on hand.
And make sure you
knew how to use them.
What happens with the
radiation is that you get ill.
You start feeling sick,
and then you are sick.
And you go on being sick.
You can't keep anything down.
You may feel better for a while,
but it always comes back.
You get weaker.
And this cures it?
Darling, you know nothing cures it.
This ends it.
But, Peter...
However ill I was,
I couldn't do that.
Who'd look after Jennifer?
Jenny will get it, too.
You're not trying to tell me
you want me to kill Jennifer?
Mary, don't be an idiot!
Supposing you get it first,
what are you going to do? Struggle
by yourself until you drop?
Jenny might live for days and be helpless
in her crib with you dead on the floor!
Don't you see that?
Don't you see it?
Darling, I'm sorry.
I can't believe it
myself half the time.
Let's not discuss it
anymore right now, Peter.
Anyway, Mrs. Hildreth's husband was
talking to someone the other day,
who said it isn't
coming here after all.
- He says it's slowing...
- For God's sake, Hildreth's a damn fool!
Let's go.
Would you like another drink?
No, let's go for a walk.
All right.
You know, I think I've
discovered why you fascinate me.
Shall I tell you?
Because you take me for granted.
I know women aren't supposed to like
that sort of thing, but somehow I do.
I've been treated
in every other way.
Like a child...
And sometimes like...
Well, like things I've
probably deserved.
But I've never been pushed
around in such a nice way
and treated something like a wife.
I suppose what I mean is,
like an American wife.
- Moira, this isn't going to do us any...
- No, hear me out.
I was hurt at first when I realized
you were mixing me up with Sharon.
And then I realized that,
that it was one of the nicest
things that could happen to me.
I wouldn't really mind if you
could forget entirely who I am.
I don't like myself
very much anyway.
Wouldn't you like to try?
No.
It seemed like a good idea.
I suppose it wasn't.
There's a train leaving at 10:50.
I think I'll take it.
You see, in the navy,
during the war,
I got used to the idea that
something might happen to me,
I might not make it.
I also got used to the idea
of my wife and
children safe at home.
They'd be all right,
no matter what.
What I didn't reckon
with was that in this...
This kind of a monstrous war,
something might happen to them
and not to me.
Well, it did.
And I can't...
I can't cope with it.
My kids...
All the planning since
the day they were born.
Sharon...
Sharon and I, we...
Well...
See, we were the sort
of people who...
We would have been happy
to grow old together.
I can't accept it. I can't...
Does that make any sense?
Do you understand?
Yes.
It makes sense.
I understand.
Good night.
I am sorry to see this.
And you were doing
so much better, too.
I would like to come
in, whatever this is.
An opium den, more than likely.
How on earth did you find me?
What is it?
It's a Ferrari.
- Does it run?
- "Does it run?"
She won the Grand Prix last year.
Bought it from Simonelli's widow.
Gave her 100 quid for it.
What are you going to do with it?
Race it, of course.
You?
Me. You needn't sound
so pessimistic.
I've always wanted to,
just never could afford it.
Sixth of August, if the
Commander gets me back in time.
You're going to kill yourself.
It's possible.
Julian?
When was it you were in
love with me and I...
And you were so stupid about it?
And I was so stupid about it.
You should have grabbed me,
you know. I'm about to be extinct.
I came here tonight, Julian,
because I want to know.
Are you still...
I'm serious.
In a normal world, I think I
would still be in love with you.
Yes or no, Julian?
But lately, with so
little time left,
my sense of values
seem to have changed.
No, then?
I'm such a fake, such a
lot of meaningless talk.
- Now, now, don't say that.
- Yes, it's true.
There have been men, lots of men.
And every time one fell out,
there was always a replacement.
But not one of them
meant anything to me.
I can't pretend any longer, Julian.
I'm afraid.
I have nobody, and I'm afraid.
What about Dwight?
He's married.
He's married to a
girl named Sharon.
- And they have two children.
- I know.
But if things were different,
if she were alive, I'd do anything.
Any mean trick I know to get him.
Even if I could make him forget,
there isn't time.
No time to love
and nothing to remember.
Nothing worth remembering.
I can't go home tonight, Julian.
May I stay here with you?
It's late, and I have to pick
up some things before we leave.
Leave? You're leaving?
At 6:00 this morning.
He didn't tell you.
Come on.
I'll take you home.
Got 56 feet, sir.
I recommend course 045, Captain.
Right rudder, new course, 045.
- Right rudder, new course, 045, sir.
- Check sonar.
Fogarty, how's it look topside?
All clear for about a
mile, scattered icebergs.
This looks like the spot.
- All stop.
- All stop!
Up periscope.
Okay. I got Point Barrow.
Bearing, 130 relative.
Distance.
- About seven miles.
- Aye, aye, sir.
All right, Mr. Osborn. You
can take your readings now.
- Chief, raise the E.C.M.
- Aye, aye, sir.
E.C.M. fully extended, sir.
It's hot, isn't it?
It's hotter than it is in mid-Pacific,
at least 30 points in the red.
That takes care of
Jorgensen's theory.
Well, we've got another job to do.
Let's get the hell out of here.
What's the course, Bob?
225, sir.
Down periscope and E.C.M.
Course 225. All ahead, standard.
Take her to 100 feet.
- Course 225. All ahead, standard.
- Just like that?
Take her to 100 feet, sir.
Fogarty, will you get us
out of this deep freeze?
When we're clear of Bering Strait,
set a course for San Francisco.
Aye, aye, sir.
Julian?
You ever been to San Francisco?
Yes, I have.
A week on the way down,
met a lovely girl.
Longest, loveliest
legs I've ever seen.
Full of martinis, both of them.
The legs, I mean.
It got to you, didn't it?
You know...
I've been trying to
get Mary to face up to it.
To make her understand what has
to be done when the time comes.
But
she won't.
She just won't.
And I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I don't think you'll have
to worry about Mary.
You don't know, Julian.
You just don't know.
You didn't see her face
when I told her...
She'd have to give Jennifer one of those
pills if it happened before I got back.
You'd have thought I was
a murderer or something.
All I was doing was what
I felt I had to do.
How do you tell a woman you love that
she has to kill herself and her baby?
How do you do it?
I envy you.
You envy me, do you?
You have someone to worry about.
I never envied anyone before.
Never really believed in it.
But you, yes, I do. I envy you.
You have a wife and a
child, nappies to change.
You have a lot to remember.
You're fortunate to have
someone to worry about.
There are those who
don't, you know?
I mean, have anyone to worry about.
Moira, for one.
Myself, for another.
We let it all go by the
boards. It's too late now.
But you, you've had it all.
And I'll thank you not to bother me
with any more of your blubbering.
I don't know why I like you so much,
Peter. You can be such an intolerable ass.
Julian?
Julian?
Now what the devil?
Thanks.
What are you standing
there looking so silly for?
I don't know. I just don't know.
You're not losing your mind
or something, are you?
No, I don't think so.
You know,
if I can just get back in time, I don't
think I'll complain about a thing.
I think I could change Jennifer 24
hours a day and never complain.
Alcatraz Island on port beam,
sir. Range, 800 yards.
Suggest we come right
10 degrees, sir.
- Right 10 degrees.
- Right 10 degrees, sir.
New course, 160.
- All stop.
- All stop.
Up both periscopes.
Captain, San Francisco is
yeoman Swain's hometown.
He wants to take a look.
Okay, let him look.
- Still doesn't make any sense.
- Down San Diego way, all right.
It's got to be hydroelectric.
Where could it be?
Probably in one of the
refineries along the coast.
They've got the transmitters
and lots of juice.
See your house, Rob?
No, sir.
You couldn't see it
from here anyway.
It's up in the hills.
Seen enough?
Yes, sir. Thank you.
You know,
I seem to keep expecting
to see more damage.
There's no people.
I wonder where they are.
Dogs go somewhere to die.
They don't want anybody
to look at them.
Maybe people do the same thing,
go to bed.
Captain!
Swain's out through the
escape trunk, sir.
Out?
Secure the loading hatch.
Drain the escape trunk.
Why didn't somebody stop him?
Raise the boat!
Give me that.
Swain, this is the
Captain. Hear this.
Don't be a damn fool, Swain!
Come back right now, and
we'll take you aboard.
But I mean right now!
Swain, do you hear me?
Swain!
I got a date on Market Street,
Captain. I'm going home!
Mr. Osborn.
How long can he last out there?
Three or four days, a week.
Depends on the individual.
We'd be safe to take
him back up till when?
Up to not more than a few hours.
Certainly not after he's eaten
or drunk something ashore.
Then you might as well
take a time bomb aboard.
It'll be dark in about an hour.
We'll set on the
bottom for the night.
Secure the diving stations.
Underway at 7:30.
- Good morning, Swain.
- Hi, Captain.
I thought you'd gone.
- Catch anything?
- No, just started.
Always do though, out here.
How are you feeling?
Okay.
My stomach was upset last night,
but I got some Alka-Seltzer
from the drugstore.
I must have swallowed
some saltwater.
What's it like in town?
Everybody's dead, I guess.
My folks are.
I didn't look much
after I saw a few.
I got a case of good
beer, if you want any.
No, thanks.
Captain, how long is it
before I feel anything?
A few days, a week.
There's no rule.
Well, the weather's okay, if the
wind would die down a little.
Captain, I didn't mean any
disrespect or anything yesterday.
I want you to
understand that, but...
I'd rather be home here to
have it than in Australia.
You know what I mean?
I know what you mean.
Is there anything you
want before we go?
I'm okay.
We won't be coming back.
I know.
You'll get pretty sick.
Have you got anything to take?
I got 200 drugstores
to choose from.
Good luck.
Okay. Take it easy.
Watch the suck of the props now.
- No soap, sir?
- Gibberish.
Can't make out a thing. I don't
know what the hell it is.
Stay with it. Got to be somebody.
You know, one of us was the
last man to see San Francisco,
the last man alive next to Swain,
that is, and we didn't see much.
Somebody ought to write
a history of the war.
What are you bucking for,
a whole chapter to yourself?
I doubt anyone could
put it all together.
Well, if they do,
I'd like to read it.
I was in it for a while, and I
didn't know anything about it.
I don't even know who started it.
I wish somebody had stopped it.
You know, the people on Mars
probably saw what happened.
When things cool off, they'll
probably come down and take over.
How about that,
Professor? Any chance?
They might have the means of
paying our corpse a visit,
but I shouldn't advise
it for a long time.
Who do you think
started it, the war?
- Albert Einstein.
- You're kidding.
Do you really want to know
who I think started the war?
- Yeah.
- Why?
You're an egghead, aren't you?
Who would ever have believed that
human beings would be stupid enough
to blow themselves off
the face of the earth?
I don't believe it even now.
We didn't want a war.
We didn't start it.
How did it start?
The trouble with you is
you want a simple answer,
and there isn't any.
The war started when people
accepted the idiotic principle
that peace could be
maintained by arranging
to defend themselves with weapons
they couldn't possibly use
without committing suicide.
Everybody had an atomic bomb
and counter-bombs and
counter-counter bombs.
The devices outgrew us.
We couldn't control them.
I know.
I helped build them. God help me.
Somewhere some poor bloke
probably looked at a radar screen
and thought he saw something.
He knew that if he hesitated
one thousandth of a second,
his own country would
be wiped off the map,
so he pushed a button.
And...
The world went
crazy.
And...
And...
What's with him?
Maybe we shouldn't ask
him any more questions.
What's new from San
Diego, Sundstrom?
Still can't make it out, sir.
We'll be there soon enough.
Lungren.
Sir?
Mr. Osborn is doing
a good job for us.
He's not used to this kind of duty.
He's not feeling well, just
a little claustrophobia.
- Beg your pardon, sir?
- Professor needs a drink.
He's a civilian. He's used to
a shot or two before dinner.
See what you can find
in the medical locker.
The closer you can come
to scotch, the better.
Yes, sir.
Pull it tighter!
Now I want you back
here in one hour.
Ditch the boat, the suit,
the tank, everything.
And take a shower in the
trunk for 10 minutes.
And no souvenirs.
All I want to see come
through that hatch is you.
As naked as a baby, understand?
We'll give you a blast
every quarter hour.
When you hear the
third quarter, get!
I don't care if you find a tribe
of beautiful girls, eager!
Get! And I mean it.
Fan your tail for home.
He's away.
Check Jones.
Sundstrom's away.
Still getting that signal?
Off and on. They never went to
radio school, those spooks,
that's for sure.
Amazing equipment
to last like that.
Wind. Window shade tugging
on a Coke bottle.
Say, what time is it in Melbourne?
1500, sir.
I hope old Bridie's listening.
She's beautiful, isn't she?
So full of life.
- Here you are, baby.
- And she always waits for the sugar.
She knows she won't get
it if she doesn't.
Go on, get out. Get.
I'll bet she would.
I'll bet if she sat down and
refused to do anything,
she'd still get the sugar.
He should be coming
home any day now.
- I'm not sure.
- Have you missed him?
Terribly.
Then why don't you tell him?
Dwight?
What a thing to do to me.
I'd given you up.
I thought the polar bears had you.
Don't you ever do that to me again,
leave me without telling me.
I don't think I will.
You're thinner. You're not ill?
No, no, a little tired.
I'm all right.
You're sure about that?
I'm positive, Ms. Davidson,
I'm absolutely positive.
Why didn't you telephone, let me
come and meet you at the station?
I thought I'd walk.
I wanted the air.
Is your invitation to spread a
little fertilizer still open?
Can you stay for a few days?
If you've got room for me.
I'd build a house if I didn't.
Peter... Peter, I...
Darling, I'll never
leave you again.
You might as well run a
railway train through here.
I beg your pardon?
There's no need to
frighten all the animals.
Sorry, sorry.
Julian.
Hello, hello.
The Admiral told me
I'd find you here.
I thought you might want to have a look at
this report of mine before I have it typed.
I'm sure it'll be all right.
Well, you don't have to
be so noisy about it.
The cows won't give
any milk for a week.
He just said that.
So this is the Ferrari?
What will she do?
I don't really know yet, but
I'll find out on Saturday.
You are coming to the
race, aren't you?
Well, I'd like to.
Will there be much of a crowd?
I shouldn't think so.
It's a question of
transport for most people.
Besides, nobody cares who wins.
I suppose you think
you're going to?
I might. It's the
fastest car, you know.
Commander, there's a
telephone call for you.
All right. Be right back.
Julian, this is ridiculous.
Why are you doing it?
Because I want to.
I can't think of a better reason.
You think it's that funny?
In view of things, don't you?
"From United States
Naval Forces, Brisbane.
"To Commander D.L. Towers,
USN, USS Sawfish.
"One, on the retirement of the present
commander US Naval Forces at this date,
"you will immediately and
henceforth assume the duty of
"Commander US Naval
Forces in all areas."
I guess this makes you an
admiral, if you want to be one.
Congratulations.
Thank you, sir.
May I dictate something
to your secretary?
Yes, I could let you
dictate something to her,
but I tried to get through to
Brisbane myself half an hour ago.
There was no reply.
They've closed up.
I see.
Thank you, sir.
He's moving up.
I wish he'd be more careful.
It's not that important.
It is to him.
He almost had it that time.
I can't watch much more
of this. Is Julian all right?
He's all right. He's
back on the track.
Julian!
He doesn't make the
slightest bit of sense.
He's never been in a race before.
Well, he won it, didn't he?
I had lunch with Admiral
Bridie yesterday.
He told me that somebody
brought pressure to bear
and got the trout season moved up.
It opens tomorrow.
Why don't we have a crack at it,
go up to the mountains
for a few days?
When?
Now.
I know just the spot.
It's nice, quiet and peaceful.

Captain.
You'd better have a
look at Ackerman.
Ackerman? What's wrong with him?
The doctor says he's in a bad way.
You'd better have a look at him.
I'll go right down.
Do that again, baby, will ya?
- Hello, Ackerman.
- Hello, Captain.
How are you feeling?
I'm okay, except I'm a little weak.
Can't seem to keep anything
in my stomach yet.
Guess I hoisted a few too
many beers the other night.
You know, I don't know what the kangaroos
are putting in the brew nowadays,
but I can sure tell you
what it tastes like.
- You just take it easy.
- Yeah.
You'll be perfectly okay.
- Dr. King here will look after you.
- I'll do fine.
Any chance that he's right?
He just had a few too many?
No, he has the full
range of symptoms.
It's radiation.
Why...
Why this one case all of a sudden?
Why? Why not? It's here.
It had to hit somebody
first. It hit this lad.
We're not machines. We're not going
to fall over in rows, you know.
- Anything you can do for him?
- No.
Except make him as
comfortable as possible.
This thing is coming
sooner than we thought.
I'm a little off balance.
I'm terribly sorry if
it's inconvenient,
but I'm afraid I can't be
held responsible for that.
I never predicted the precise date.
No, I don't think we have a
freak case here, Commander.
I've been getting very irritable
myself, as you can see.
It's one of the first symptoms.
O lord, give us the strength.
Help us to understand the reason
for this madness on earth,
the reason why we have
destroyed ourselves.
Give us the courage
to bear thy will,
and when the end is upon us,
give us thy hand and
show us the way.
That we may better understand
that only you can give,
and only you can take away.
Forgive those of us who are weak,
as we forgive each other.
For Jesus' sake. Amen.
Simpson, John.
Jones, Norman, Molly,
Kenneth and Kim.
Dickson, George and Lola.
You all know the situation.
I've given leave to many of you,
to stay here for personal reasons.
It's understandable why some
of you might prefer this.
I think that the rest of you are entitled
to decide what you'd like to do.
I'd like you to think about it.
Take a vote if you need to.
Give me your decision
by this evening.
I think that's all.
Captain.
We've already taken a vote.
We'd like to head for home.
Just give it to me straight.
How much longer?
We're 15 points in the red.
Up three and a half
since last night.
I suppose you've heard about Mary.
No. What?
Quite irrational.
Peter came in Sunday to find her
packing for a trip back to England,
taking Jennifer.
I'm sorry to hear that.
She's a bit calmer now,
doctor and all that.
Dwight?
Yes?
What about Moira?
I want to stay with
her right to the end,
but I had to leave it to the men.
We're going.
When do you leave?
In a day, two at the most.
You might not have that much time.
Yes, I know.
I've got to see her right away.
So long, Julian.
God bless.
Hosgood?
Hosgood?
Yes, sir?
It looks as if we've
had it, Hosgood.
Would you like shore leave
or are you staying aboard?
I'm remaining aboard, sir.
Would you have a glass of
sherry with an old man?
No, sir,
but I would very much like
to have one with you,
sir.
There's one thing that
always bothered me, Hosgood.
A girl like you...
Why no young men?
They never asked me.
I guess maybe it was the uniform.
To a blind...
Blind world.
I think I can get Mrs. Andrews
to help me out with Jennifer.
Yes, but if you need anything,
you'd better call me.
I'm sure she'll be all right, but I wish
there was something I could do for Mary.
Mary, Mary.
Moira, it's for you.
Hello. Dwight.
Yes, I'll be there!
Right away, Dwight!
I'll be there!
Moira!
You're not going.
- You're staying. You're staying.
- No.
I'm going.
- But the Sawfish...
- Just across the bay
at the fuel depot.
The men want to try to get home.
I can't explain it.
Then I suppose that the
time has come to say,
"it's been nice, Dwight Lionel.
"It's been everything."
Dwight, I'm so frightened.
I know.
I'm so sorry for so many things.
I love you, Moira.
I love you.
I love you.
Mary.
Mary.
I love you.
Did you say something, Peter?
I didn't hear.
I said, "I love you."
I... I feel so strange.
You remember the first
time we ever met?
It was on the beach.
I thought you were everything
I'd ever dreamed about,
everything I ever wanted.
I thought you were so underfed.
Every day after that,
I went to the beach,
but you were never there.
I had the flu. My mother
made me stay at home.
I looked for you.
I looked for you so.
Did you suffer horribly?
Mary, you'll never know.
Did you really?
I thought I couldn't bear it
if I didn't see you again.
I'd about given up hope,
but one day,
there you were.
Now it's all over, isn't it?
It's all over.
And I want you to know
that I could never have been happy
with anyone in the world but you.
I've loved you, Peter.
I've been foolish,
and I haven't been practical,
but I've loved you so much.
So much.
We've been happy and fortunate.
And Jennifer...
She'll never have the chance.
She'll never know what love is.
- Peter, Peter, you'll see that she's...
- I will, I will.
Darling.
God!
God forgive us.
Peter,
I think I'll have
that cup of tea now.
