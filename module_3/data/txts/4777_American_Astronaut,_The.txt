To classify all the bodies in the solar system
it is necessary...
to adopt an arbitrary set of criteria;
a criteria...
which must also apply to the minor planets,
or asteroids.
Let us now look at the asteroid belt
between Mars and Jupiter.
The classification of this group of
fragmented planetismals began in...
1801 with the discovery of Ceres.
Ceres, having a diameter of 955
kilometres...
is found to be the largest member of
several hundred sizable boulders...
Locked in what would seem to be a
merry-go-round of primordial debris...
from a very early phase of planetary
formation.
Out of over two thousand asteroids
regularly charted and observed...
Ceres, due to its large size,
convenient location and availability...
was found to be the perfect spot
for a drinking establishment...
or bar if you will.
It was named, appropriately enough,
"The Ceres Crossroads".
And it was more often than not,
frequented by roughnecks...
and thugs. It is here where our
story began.
The story of how I became a father.
And oh yeah, it's my birthday.
Shit
Ceres Crossroads.
Eddy speaking.
Eddy, Samuel Curtis.
I just landed...
I know. We saw it.
It was great.
Can you dig me out and
set me up for flight?
Sure. Did you bring the cat?
Yeah. I got him. His name is
Monkey Puss.
I want to name him Oscar.
That wasn't so bad. Was it, Monkey?
Eddy, you got something for me, right??
Oh, yeah.
Okay. I'll be in in a bit.
Okay. Good-bye.
All right, cat, let's go.
I'm keeping that with me.
You seen Eddy?
Yes. He's right over there by
the corner of the bar.
You mean the bartender?
Thanks.
Samuel Curtis.
I know. We watched you land. Everybody
here got just the biggest...
charge out of it. I'm still buzzin'.
In fact, everybody's buzzin'.
You got something for me,
right?
You're not going to believe what
I got for you.
No one can come back here but me, so we
can keep Oscar here 'till they come and get him.
I thought he was for you.
Oh, no. I hate cats, but you sure saved
my butt bringing him here.
- You're staying, right?
- What is that?
You're staying for the big dance,
aren't you?
Yeah, sure.
I don't get it.
It's a girl. It's a real live girl.
What am I supposed to do
with it?
I don't know.
Who's playing at the dance
tonight?
Me.
I guess I'll see you there. Mind If
I use your bathroom?
Sure. It's a real toilet so
be careful.
Thanks, Eddy.
That's him.
Hey Boy-Hey Boy...
I got a message for you...
about a thing called love and the
stars above. And a little white dove,
sends push turn to shove to
fist to cuffs.
Things really got rough.
But enough's enough.
Hey Boy-Hey Boy...
I heard it from a friend about you...
about your hatred when you're
laying in your bed...
and your facing the tread with
your hatred fed...
from the things you said. And you
wish you were dead...
because you're separated from a thing
called love. And the stars above.
And a little white dove sends push
turn to shove to fist to cuffs
Things really got rough.
But enough's enough
Hey Boy-Hey Boy...
I heard it from a friend about you...
that you're heart broken and your
anger's smoking.
And you lie there poking at a
Little token...
of days gone by. You let out a sigh.
Tears fill your eyes.
And you start to cry. And say,
Oh God why.
And you wish you could die.
And your eyes won't dry.
And time don't fly on this
hellish night.
Eyes wide open on this hellish
ride
as you go switching from side to side
because you're filled with hatred...
when you're lying in your bed. And
your face turns red...
with your hatred fed from the things you
said. And you wish you were dead...
because you're separated from a thing
called love. And the stars above...
and a Little white dove sends push
turn to shove to fist to cuffs.
Things really got rough.
But enough's enough!
Hey Boy-Hey Boy...
I heard it from a friend about you...
Hey!
Hey! You son of a bitch! Hey!
Hey!
Did you just see two guys come
out of that bathroom?
Here you go.
Hey, is it just me, or do my
balls itch?
I think it's you.
Good. For a minute, I thought my
balls itched.
Hey, it's a joke.
It's funny.
Fuck it.
This what you're looking for?
Larry Blueberry.
My name Is Lawrence. It's never been
Larry. I don't like that name.
I hear you're doing pretty good
these days.
I heard you were killed by
Professor Hess.
Yeah, well. Apparently your
photographers have proven otherwise.
That's the Blueberry Pirate.
An Interplanetary fruit thief and old
dance partner of Samuel Curtis'.
Came here to pick up a cat named Oscar as
payment for some stolen fruit he'd delivered.
Here's where they get reacquainted at the bar,
all nice and friendly, just like that, see?
Old friends, that's all. This is where
the pirate
gives Curtis some pictures and oh so
gracefully bestows upon him...
the perfect plan for an astronaut in
his position.
In return Samuel Curtis agrees to be
the Pirate's partner at...
the big dance contest because Curtis
didn't have a plan and...
the Pirate never won anything in his
whole life and those were...
The most beautiful trophies he'd ever
seen. Unquote.
Curtis' new mission is to return to Earth
with the body of a man named...
Johnny R.
Johnny R. Came from a very wealthy
family.
A family that's willing to award a great
deal of wealth for the return of his remains.
Right now his body is being preserved on
Venus, the planet of beautiful women.
The planet of women who can reproduce
without the use of men.
Unfortunately, if more than three generations
go by without introducing new blood...
the women become high-bred and even
too snippy for themselves to stand.
So it's necessary for them to keep a
man around as a stud.
The women of Venus adopt an adolescent
male from a well-to-do family...
ride him like a wild stallion, treat him
like a king...
and love him until the day he dies,
usually at a ripe old age.
And then replace him with another
adolescent male.
Johnny R. had reached that ripe old age
and the time had come to replace him...
but the women of Venus won't part with his body
until an adequate replacement has been delivered.
The perfect replacement could be found
on Jupiter.
Jupiter's a very wealthy mining planet, where
infant males are taken and sold to a man...
named Lee Vilensky.
They're raised as workers and grow up to be
strong men with no knowledge of women.
Lee Vilensky owns Jupiter and years
before he had purchased a boy...
from Samuel Curtis known as...
The Boy who actually saw a
woman's breast.
For this brief experience the boy has
been treated as a treasure.
He's become the planet's
figurehead.
He's used to boost the morale of workers
by performing in great night rallies...
where he quickly and arrogantly describes
what it is he had seen.
Over the years, the boy had grown up to
be a strong and handsome young man...
and both the Blueberry Pirate and Samuel Curtis
know that the women of Venus would go nuts for him.
They also believe that Lee Vilensky
would part with the boy in trade for...
the real live girl.
He could raise her, marry her, have sex
with her...
then describe the experience to his
workers in great detail.
That would be an incredible morale
booster.
That would create a happier, more
productive work environment.
So I take the girl to Jupiter...
trade her for the boy, bring the boy to
Venus...
trade him for Johnny R...
bring Johnny R. Back to earth and I
get rich.
That's it.
Where'd the girl come from?
Eddy cloned her from one of his
own cells.
That's one detail best left unsaid.
Gentlemen, is it just me or do my balls
itch?
So this guy walks into a bar and he says
to the bartender...
"Can I use your phone?" The bartender says, "Sure".
So, he wipes his ass on it and the bart...
What?
Ah shit, I just told you the punchline.
I've been telling this joke so fuckin'
long, I knew I'd fuck it up.
Anyway. You want to hear something
really weird?
So there's this man and he lived his whole life
on Earth and his name was Mr. Stevenson.
When Mr. Stevenson was eight years
old, he asked another little boy...
If he would Like a Hurts Donut. The other
boy said, "Yes."
So he hit him on the arm and he said,
"Hurts Donut?".
Five years later Mr. Stevenson asked another
boy about his same age at that time...
If he would like a Hurts Donut.
When the boy said, "Yes", Mr. Stevenson
stabbed him over and over again...
In his eye, in his cheek with a pencil...
saying, "Hurts Donut?"
Over the years Mr. Stevenson did very
well in school.
On graduation day he was sat next to
another young man, who...
Like Mr. Stevenson, had earned high marks.
When he asked the boy if he would Like
a Hurts Donut, the boy said...
"Not if you're going to stab me in the
eye with a pencil."
"I wouldn't even touch you," said Mr. Stevenson.
So when the boy agreed, he presented him with
a photograph of the young man's fiance...
at a bachelor party, on some guy's table,
fucking herself with a beer bottle.
As tears filled the young man's eyes,
Mr. Stevenson was heard to say...
"Hurts Donut."
A few years later Mr. Stevenson got a job
as a sales clerk in an electronics store.
Within a year, he was caught stealing
and immediately incarcerated.
When he asked his cellmate if he would Like
a Hurts Donut, his cellmate said "Yeah"
So he gave him a Hurts Donut.
Over the years Mr. Stevenson grew too old to
hospital.
One day he asked the new nurse if she
would Like a Hurts Donut.
In anticipation of her response, Mr.
Stevenson began humming...
while making smacking noises with
his mouth.
When the nurse smiled and said, "I
know about you Mr. Stevenson,"
Mr. Stevenson blurted out something
totally incoherent...
and began to laugh.
I've never understood this joke.
But then I've never been to Earth.
All right. All right. Gentlemen, let
the dance contest begin.
Love is a flipping rolling riddle.
Love is a smiling when you the giggle
of those angels.
Giggle when they know you're smiling.
Love is rotting in an open field.
Love is smiling at the happy way you feel...
when you know you're smiling.
So how can you keep on smiling...
when you see yourself in the mirror
smiling?
Just about to say the name of the girl
that makes you smile.
Love is thinking of when you die.
When she hears your name mentioned...
she starts to cry.
She'll remember you smiling.
Love is living in a magic land.
Love is thinking...
of the day she'll hold your
hand...
And you'll both be smiling.
So how can you keep on smiling
when...
you see yourself in the mirror smiling?
Just about...
to say the name of the girl that
makes you cry.
Let's go.
What about your boys over there?
They'll be sitting this one out.
One, two, three, four.
What did he say about me?
What did he say about me?
Who are you?
You know, you are so square.
I guess that I am.
So what did he say about me?
I don't know what you're talking
about.
You stand there with that trophy and you
tell me you don't know what I'm talking about?
Excuse me.
You sit at the bar and you talk and you laugh
and you tell me you don't know what I'm...
...talking about, huh?
- Do not touch me.
Don't touch you? I can touch you.
I can touch you whenever I want.
Guess what?
It's my birthday.
Did he tell you it was my birthday?
Are you going to sing Happy
Birthday to me?
I want you to sing Happy Birthday
to me.
I said I want...
I got work to do.
This one's a keeper.
You ready, cat?
What did your father teach you?
What did your father teach you?
My father taught me to kill the
sunflower.
Congratulations, Mr. Curtis. You
are now awake.
Two hours to Jupiter.
Gentlemen, you have all worked
very hard...
and among the lucky, you are the
chosen ones.
You have been sprinkled with lucky
stardust.
Yes, you have.
For today you have been chosen to
reside in the court of the Great One.
Gentlemen, I give you...
"The Boy Who Actually Saw...
a Woman's Breast."
A, A, E, I.
A, E, I know. I know.,
A, E, I, O, U.
O, U sweet thing. Yes. A, E, A,
E, I.
A, E, I, O, U. I O U nothing. But
sometimes you owe me.
You owe me. You owe me I. E. A.
I. E. A.A.A.A.
I'm talking to you when I say why do
the souls of my old dead dogs...
still howl at the sirens, so call the cops
and call the fire trucks and call the cops.
Call the police.
There is something walking round
inside my fleece.
I've thick, black, stuff under my nails.
And I think I kind of like the way it smells.
There is food pressed against my gums.
In a week or two, we'll see what it
becomes.
So I'll shave and look cute...
with the sweat from in my boot.
And I'll sneeze the snot from my
snoot.
And I'll wipe it on the sleeve of
my suit.
A. E. I. O. A. E. I. O. I. O. A.
E. I. O. A. E. Ooh!
It was round and soft.
Now go back to work.
Good job.
Alright.
Sam!
Hey. There he Is. How you doing,
Buddy?
Fine.
What's the matter wlth him?
You know how kids are. You sell them to a shitty
planet and they think you're the bad guy.
Yeah, well I'm here to make it up to
the little guy.
What do you mean?
I came here to take him.
No, no, no. That boy holds the only
memory we got.
Mr. Vilensky, you give me back the boy and I'll
give you the chance to create your own memories.
What the hell is that?
It's a real live girl. You take this.
You grow her in private. You
raise her.
You teach her. You marry her.
All for a kid whose brief, fleeting
encounter...
pales in comparison to the
experiences that await you.
Let's say that I was going to show
her to somebody right now...
my daughter or wife or whatever the
hell she is.
She looks bad.
Why would you show her to
anybody?
What if I wanted to?
Hey kid, take a hike.
When we first saw it, we knew there
was just one thing to be done.
It was scientific.
And sociological.
That's right. And a lot of fun.
We knew in this world there
could only be one...
The baby in the jar with glasses
on and a gun.
Glasses on.
Gentlemen...
The Boy Who Saw A Woman's Breast
has left our planet.
Allow me to explain.
In this simple black case...
I hold the dawning of a new day.
The dawning of a new era.
An ear of sexually explicit...
conversation.
For here in my hand I hold the case...
that contains...
a real live girl.
She should be raised in private.
She shall be taught all there is to
know of our work ethic.
And on a dally basis she will be
notified...
of the triumphs made by...
each and every one of your selfless
efforts.
When she is fifteen and a half she
will become my bride...
and your queen.
You will all partake in fresh fruit...
brought here by the Blueberry
Pirate himself.
And I will partake in fresh fruit...
and sexual intercourse.
An act in which we are all a
stranger...
but which upon my return...
I will describe to you in great detail.
Hey, get out.
Where'd you get the trophy?
I won it at a dance.
On Ceres?
Yeah.
I wanted to go to that.
How come Vilensky didn't
take you?
Yeah, right.
How long have they been making
you dress like that?
The word is not "make",
it's "let".
They let me wear whatever
I want.
I see.
Let's have a party. I think we'll
have a party now.
Let's have a party.
It's great when you get started out.
We'll throw our hands up and
shout "Party".
We'll throw our heads back and say
"Party", "Party", "Party".
Oh won't you come and join our
party?
Let's have a party.
I think we'll have a party now.
Let's have a party.
It's great when you get started out.
We'll throw our hands up and
shout "Party".
We'll throw our heads back and say
"Party", "Party", "Party".
Oh, wont you come and join our,
Oh, won't you come and join our...
Oh, won't you come and join our,
Oh, won't you come and join our...
Oh, won't you come and join our,
oh, won't you come and join our...
Another job well done.
These are the same song books you
had five years ago.
Yeah.
You know any new songs?
Yeah, I know some new songs but
they're not very nice.
How about you?
Yeah, I know some okay songs.
Well, let's hear them. It's going to be
a long trip.
Teach me a song.
There's a...
Phone call. Phone call. Phone call.
Nice song.
Samuel Curtis, American Private
Sec. Nevada.
Guess who this is?
Professor Hess.
That's right. You got it on the
first try. For that you get a kiss.
I'll pass.
What? Do you think I'd kiss
you?
You'd love it if I kissed you and
I would never kiss you!
You said you were going to kiss me.
I never said I'd kiss you. I never said
that. You just want me to kiss you!
Not really.
Oh. I'm not good enough to kiss you?
Is that what you're saying?
What do you want Professor?
Guess what today is?
I don't know. What?
Guess.
It's Friday, Saturday somewhere.
I don't know.
It's my birthday.
Oh well, Happy Birthday.
Are you going to sing Happy
Birthday to me?
No.
Why not? Why aren't you going to
sing Happy Birthday to me?
I don't like the song.
You are so square.
Did you call me to insult me,
Professor?
You're very important to me.
I want you to hear something.
Did you hear that?
No.
It was a cat purring.
I took him from Ceres because there
was nobody left to take care of him.
And now he's purring, cause now he's
with me, cause now he's happy.
And now it's time for his treat.
Oh, he likes that.
I've got to go, Professor.
Guess how old I am?
I don't know.
I'm ninety-six.
No you're not.
Yes I am! I'm ninety-six!
Why won't you believe I'm
ninety-six?
I guess you just look young.
Well, what would you say if I said
that I'm younger than...
ninety-six, because I just am?
I'd say good-bye, Professor.
I have a picture of you.
Guess what you're doing?
I'm talking a shit.
I put it next to my Trophy and...
then I say, "Oow, there's a
stinky boy".
I got to go. Good-bye, Professor.
Well, fine! Fine! But if you see any big pictures
of me don't tell anyone that you know me.
It's a deal.
No. No, you don't have to see any
big pictures of me...
because I'm going to catch up
with you...
And then we're going to have
a birthday party.
I guess I'll see you then.
A friend?
A question to which yes or no
would not quite suffice.
Does he call a lot?
No.
He disappears for long stretches of
time.
Then he finds me...
kills everyone I come in contact
with...
and tries to forgive me.
When he does that he's going to
kill me.
Do you like him?
Yeah.
He's like family.
And when he forgives you, he's
going to kill you?
That's the kind of guy he is.
What kind of guy is he?
He's a Birthday Boy.
He kills without reason.
If he has no reason to kill you,
then he can kill you.
But if he has a reason to kill you
then he's got a problem.
And if he kills you without
resolving that problem, then...
you'd be dead and the problem
would live on forever unresolved.
That doesn't make any sense.
Yeah, it does.
What did you do that was so hard
to forgive?
Well...
I'll tell you.
Hey, I think I see a barn up ahead.
We'll hide our spaceship in the
barn.
What if there's something in there?
How do?
Nice...
nice cabin in the sky you've
got here.
Well, hell. Why don't you take off
your boots and float around?
Where you from?
We're Earth people.
Yeah. Where about?
Silver State of Nevada. How
about yourself?
Yeah, I'm from there, but I moved
around a lot.
What about the boy here?
Is he your son?
No, I'm just giving him a ride to
Venus.
Yeah? What happened? Their King die
or something?
Yeah.
Son of a bitch.
How old are you, kid?
Fifteen.
Son of a bitch.
We got a little bastard about
your age.
How'd you like to go kick his ass?
No, thank you.
What are you scared?
He's got candy bars and cigarettes
back there.
Now go kick the shit out of him.
Ah, it don't make no difference.
Little fuckers' going to kill us all.
Who's the kid?
He ain't got no real name. We call
him Bodysuit.
Raised him so he could go back to
earth to find out more about the chart.
But he ain't worth a shit!
You see, in the year 1902 we were
just a bunch of silver miners.
Out there every day digging in the
dirt...
uneducated, and humping on each
other...
every chance we could.
Hell, sometimes some of us good ole
boys'd even be humping on each other.
And it weren't like we were be trying
to be fancy.
We just didn't know what the hell we
were looking at. Did we John?
Yeah we did
Huh. So one day I dug up this rock
and it was a brand new color.
Not a trace or hint or nothing...
of any other color you ever seen.
It looked like, like memories and,
well, it was embarrassing.
And if you looked at it...
all the parts of your brain that just
sat there doing nothing...
would start right up and you knew
what they were there for.
So we looked at it and it turned us
real smart.
The next day we went into town and
read all there was to read about the Chart.
Then we went out into the desert,
built us this big barn...
and sent it up here into space with
us in it.
Been here ever since.
Now the one thing we didn't reckon
on was space punies.
What are space punies?
Hey Jake. What are space
punies?
In a world without gravity...
the muscles will become dormant
and whither.
Your spine will straighten and the
calcium...
in your arms and legs will redistribute
itself in your head.
Thank you, Jake. See old Jake knows.
Hey Jake, what happens if you go
back to Earth with Space punies?
It kills you slicker than snot.
That's right...
So now we got to get back there
cause every day...
they're making further discoveries
about the Chart.
In an attempt to further our
knowledge...
Jake and Edna started humping on
each other...
And Io and behold, a child was born
among us.
Had we known he'd have grown up
to be such a hellion...
we'd have killed him on that day.
Instead we raised him on coffee,
tobacco, candy bars...
kind of stuff our guts couldn't take.
We built him a suit of hydraulics...
so his muscles would grow strong.
He was raised to stand up against
Earth's gravity...
as he set out to gain more knowledge
on behalf of his kin...
A journey the boy don't know
nothing about...
on account of him being as dumb
as a stick.
How are you planning on getting
him back to Earth?
We's kind of hoping you'd take him.
Let's see if we can get his chocolate
and cigarettes.
If we take him to Earth, can we keep
his chocolate and cigarettes?
We ain't got no need for it.
Okay.
I hope you don't mind if we take
our time loading up.
We're trying to avoid someone.
That'll give you boys some time to
get acquainted.
He's right through that door there.
Thanks.
If you ever find us again...
could you tell us what the chart's
looking like these days...
Captain? Captain?
He stinks.
What?
He stinks.
Excuse me.
Well.
Let's get him out of that stinky suit.
Smell your hand.
What if we leave him in the suit
and wash him as he is?
We should probably just wipe him
down with solvent.
Pin him.
This is the Rio Yeti. Okay?
And when I do this line...
I'm going to talk and when I do the next line
I'm going to move your mouth like this. Okay?
South America is where I want to go.
Don't you fear Yeti's in Rio?
No. No? No.
Rio Yeti. Rio Yeti. Rio Yeti.
Rio Yeti.
When I get to Venus, can I get a
dog?
Dogs can't Live on Venus.
When they roll on their backs
the...
pressure twists their guts up and it
kills them.
Do you remember my old dog?
Yeah.
If I don't like Venus will you come
get me?
Believe me...
You'll like it.
What are you going to do?
South America is where I'm going
to go.
Don't you fear the Yetis in Rio?
No.
No?
No! No, No, No, No, No, No,
No, No, No, No...
Ri-o Ye-ti, Ri-o Ye-ti, Ri-o Ye-ti...
No! No, No, No, No, No, No,
No, No, No.
Ri-o Ye-ti, Ri-o Ye-ti, Ri-o Ye-ti...
Uh oh. Did I say something I should
not have?
No.
No?
No! No, No, No, No, No, No,
No, No, No.
Ri-o Ye-ti, Ri-o Ye-ti, Ri-o Ye-ti...
What did your father teach you?
What did your father teach you?
My father taught me to kill the
sunflower.
Congratulations, Mr. Curtis, you are
now awake.
Ten minutes to Venus.
What the fuck?
How many minutes?
You all ready for your big day?
You take care of him.
I'll be back in a bit.
What style. What class.
The girl with the vagina made of glass.
So perfect and pure, and
gynecologically demure.
And the way her buttocks chews on
her shorts is very nice.
Oh, yes, it's very nice.
And the way her perfect bosoms need
no support...
Oh, yes, that too is very nice.
And wherever she may go all heavens
surround her.
Envy's green-eyed monsters confound
her.
Age-old myths and legends come true.
Ancient prophecies all come to pass.
All this and all because of you...
the girl with the vagina made of glass.
Why, Samuel Curtis, you flatter
me.
My dear Cloris, any beautiful words
spoken on your behalf would only...
Well, if you were only twenty years
younger...
we'd all have our way with you.
Which brings me to another subject.
Not that I could ever tire of speaking
on your behalf...
but I would like to proposition you.
You have my attentions.
Please don't think that my complete
focus is not on you and the ladies...
but in my peripheral...
I couldn't help but notice the handsome
remains of a gentleman.
Johnny R.
We still love him so. Honest we do.
But it just hasn't been the same since
his Venusian demise.
Yeah, I Imagine it wouldn't be.
You know, his family would like
his body back.
We are all well aware of that,
Samuel Curtis.
We are also aware of the honorarium
they have offered...
and the greedy, heartless show of
scavengery we might expect...
as a result of their generous offer.
We might also have expected that you,
Samuel Curtis...
could have been a little more sensitive
to our feelings...
Instead of being the first to come and
try to take away our Johnny.
I was actually going to swap you
for him.
What could you have that would
possibly match the value...
of our beloved Johnny's remains?
I've got a sixteen year old boy in
my ship.
Oh, Samuel.
I swear, we had no way of knowing.
How could you know?
Your messenger never mentioned a
swap.
He just said that you were coming.
- My messenger? -
HI, Sam.
Jesus Christ!
That's Professor Hess.
A Professor?!
Did you miss me?
No.
Yes you did. You did too miss me.
You're just saying that to make me mad.
The Professor brought us a cat.
Cloris...
I'm afraid I won't be able to stay.
Have your ladles dig my ship out of
the mud...
and load Johnny into the bottom
cargo hatch.
Why, a visit from Mr. Curtis wouldn't be the same
If we didn't have to dig his ship out of our mud.
Oh, Samuel.
The Professor suggests that we should
meet the boy first.
I'll go get him.
But if we could just make this fast.
Of course. And Samuel?
He is descended from great wealth,
Is he not?
Yeah.
And please tell me he is a good dancer.
The ladies do love to dance.
Yeah, he's great.
I'll have him bring his trophy.
Move!
I keep trying to get ready and he
keeps jumping in front of the mirror...
playing with his face.
You're not going out there.
What?!
Shut up. Professor Hess is here. If
he sees you he's going to kill you.
Why's he want to kill me?
No reason.
Let's fly out of here.
There not going to dig out our ship
until they get a boy.
Him.
Yeah.
That's what I'm thinking.
Put on some of my clothes and
give him yours.
Why does he have to wear my clothes?
He doesn't have to...
he gets to.
Ladies...
here's your new lover boy.
Well, isn't he fancy.
Who the hell is that?
That's the new King of Venus.
That is not Lee Vilensky's boy.
Well, Samuel, please explain.
Who is this fanciful dandy who
has so quickly stolen our hearts?
What!?
That's the wealthiest child in the
Solar System.
He is not.
Yes he is.
No he isn't.
Yes, he is.
Oh.
He seems to be in need of a bath.
I haven't noticed.
Smell your hand.
I will kill him.
You have every reason to kill him.
Good luck, Professor.
Samuel Curtis!
It's my birthday.
Some other time, Professor.
This is where it ends...
and other stories began.
Sam moved back to earth with the
young man who saw the breast...
and raised him as if he were his
own son.
I stayed on Venus to help raise
Bodysuit...
In the hopes that he would grow up
to be a fine young man...
and I could kill him.
But a boy seldom lives up to his
Father's expectations.
