Good, good, you've come back,
good job.
And you're jealous, jealous, yeah.
Lyudka,
aye, Lyudka!
Lyudka,
aye, Lyudka!
Did you take money?
Oh, Nadya has noticed! Too late,
the bogeyman took the money!
Get out of here,
get out!
Dad, did you take the money from the
wardrobe?
Mom will teach you a lesson,
you can't even imagine
how angry she is!
Vasiliy, hey, Vasiliy!
Answer me!
I know you're there.
What do you want, Nadya?
What?
- Go and get me some water.
- There is a whole tub in the bathhouse.
- Really? Where?
- Me and Lyonka brought some water yesterday.
- Well, I wanted to wash clothes.
- So why not use that water?
I will use you instead. Oh how will
I make use of you, you sponger!
Where did those 30 rubles go?!
Why are you such a crook?!
If you buy more pigeons, I'll drown
you together with them, you sponger!
- You'll break the ladder.
- I'll break your ribs!
Stupid pigeon-keeper,
he is worried about the ladder! Oh you!
Well, I'll be the one
to repair this ladder, Nadya.
Beware, 'cause you'll have
to repair yourself!
Get out, I tell you!
Did you buy them or not?
Oh, sponger!
Olya, tell your mother the truth!
Did your old man buy any pigeons?
- Hey, do you hear? I am talking to you!
- Yes.
So that's it, that is where your
dresses and ice-cream go,
and your boots and lipstick,
Lyudka.
We'll be starving now.
Hey, isn't that too much for
25 rubles, Nadya?
Yeah, go and kiss you pigeons
and continue to fleece us!
They are beautiful, the pigeons.
So you knew and you haven't even
uttered a word to your Mom!
- Nadya, these ones are tafty.
- Oh!
- What do you mean?
- They have these plums on back of their heads.
- Wanna see?
- Just you dare to step out from there!
Lyudka! What are we going to do?
- We don't have any more cash.
- We still have money in the account.
Oh, just you wait till I find something
to chuck at you!
- Have you deposited much to withdraw now?
- Well, but you did!
Oh, I feel like killing you with
something, you sponger!
Well, Lyudka, go and fetch the bankbook.
- Where?
- There!
- Ah...
- Yeah!
Hey you, go and fix the oven.
I am tired of using the stove
every time I need to cook.
Do you hear me?
Yeah, Nadya, I'll go fix it in a minute.
Mom, he has waited for these pigeons
the whole month!
Olya, do you think that
earning money is easy?
That'd be fine if he used it for
something real, but pigeons...
Well, at least he isn't drinking.
Yeah, that's true. He isn't drinking.
OK, I'll go to the store now.
What are you standing here for with the
peeling eyes, miss Dad's protectress?
Lyudka, when Lyonya comes home
from vocational school feed the lad.
He can fix a meal himself.
If you talk like this to your
husband, he'll run away from you!
But Dad hasn't run away from you.
Do not compare yourself with me,
I forgive and forget quickly.
- Hey, you should eat too.
- I don't want to.
- Where is the fuel can?
- In the shed. Where are you going?
We'll swim to the neighboring village
with Uncle Sasha.
They have gunpowder
in the store there.
- Buy my share too.
- Sure!
- I wish you wealth and health!
- Hi, Uncle Mitya! Bye, Uncle Mitya!
- Vasiliy, Lyudka, hello!
- Sit down and have lunch with us, Uncle Mitya!
- Yeah, sure.
- Hi, Aunt Sasha, bye, Aunt Sasha!
Uncle Mitya, hide it!
There, yes.
She won't find it there.
Hey, Lyudka, came for a vacation?
Why alone?
- Where is your young...
- Uncle Mitya, don't.
Well, she has some troubles with
her young man.
- What's happened?
- We don't ask.
Yeah, good of you to come.
Oh, look at them!
They're already chasing
a drink! That was to be expected!
Chasing a drink, are you?
Oh, my dear Sasha is here!
Yeah, your dear
Sasha is here!
I saw you by the store, so I called:
Mitya, Mitya! No reaction!
Just zips along!
Ha? What d'you say? Oh, my hearing
is so bad nowadays... Say something.
What should I say?
- Hello, Uncle Mitya.
- I can't hear you.
I'll have to go the ear doctor and
get some thingy for my ear.
I didn't drink, I didn't! Though
there is a good reason for drinking.
Or Bastille Day will go to waste...
80 years since the birth of...
Wow! Can't be that she's
80 already!
Sit down, Aunty, eat with us.
Has today's mail come?
Katya is on her way,
I've just seen her.
- Aunty, please, help yourself, alright?
- Yeah, you go!
Vasiliy, what is that you are
washing your hands with?
You sponger!
Well, Sasha, I will
never forgive you for this...
Why are you laughing? Our proud
battleship never surrenders to the foe!
<i>When lassies go to
bathhouse</i>
<i>I climb on its roof</i>
<i>and I stomp my feet. </i>
- Got a day off?
- Yep.
So why are you drinking?
Did you squabble with Nadya?
Aha. God knows what...
Yeah, I'm at odds with mine too.
She's there now, and I'm here.
She'll come here and
I'll go there!
I let her do the marathon!
- Drinking, eh?
- Drinking! Hello, Sasha!
- Have a sip.
- Nah, I don't like this.
- Is everything OK?
- Yeah.
- Cheers!
- Take the buckets.
Well, better send him to the Navy
than to the Forestry.
- He decided on his own!
- Ah, he knows nothing about the beauty of sea life!
- Lyonya, don't tell mother!
- Yeah, OK.
I can't for the life of me
understand you
I fight with my bogeywoman,
while you always accept the blame.
- What does she want anyway, why the fuss?
- It's because of the pigeons.
But she's not angry anymore.
Well, you just strap her once and
she'll become as good as gold!
That's what they are like,
they've gotten pretty brazen!
Pour some more!
Take highlanders for instance,
how do they deal with this issue:
When they talk,
she won't enter a room.
That's because they're mountaineers.
Oh. I mean, people from the mountains!
Have you seen mine?
Sure! Where else can he be,
if not here!
It's only a couple of mugs,
to not forget the taste!
Give me your bag, I'll help.
It's probably heavy.
Oh, what a helper, look at him!
Took a pity on me!
- Have you seen Filipov?
- No. What's up?
- Well of course! If you ever are at home!
He's looking for you. - Why?
See, his crank broke down, he
asks for some help. Run to him.
- Bah! Son of a biscuit! So I better run.
- Yeah, go.
- Vasiliy! Has my beau swam nearby?
- No, I haven't seen him.
Oh those spongers!
Yeah, spongers.
Well, that's a good one! In your age,
why can't you stop fighting?
Oh, I laugh too much.
It's not a good sign.
I have to help harvest potatoes tomorrow
in the morning, Filipov asked.
- I won't be able to go now!
- Gee, he'll be back, he's nowhere else to go!
- Oh, Nadya, could you please give me
your spade. Ours is so blunt.  - Yeah.
Mitya would've sharpened it, but he's
nowhere to be found,
just watch his smoke.
Lyudka, aye, Lyudka!
Take the bags. Here you go!
- Here you go!
- Hello, dear Lyuda!
Hello, Aunty Sasha!
Oh, I can't take my eyes off of you!
Hey, Nadya, do you hear what I'm saying?
I can't take my eyes off Lyudka!
Oh what a beauty you grew up to be!
A real beauty, that's what you are!
Why don't you visit us? Hey, drop in
sometime for a cup of tea with jams!
I have such a yummy lingonberry jam
this year!
Here you go, Aunty Sasha!
- Nadya!
- What?
Where were you, you old loon?
I have brought terrible news to your
house, Mrs Nadya,
call all of your children.
What happened?
Vasiliy went to repair that crank
and I went with him.
He wanted to have a smoke.
So he came, and as he
lit his cigaret...
And me, I sat near him...
Hey, you old fool, out with it!
You drive people into a frenzy with this.
I don't understand bogeywomen.
Nadya, take her away.
She's right! Don't drag your feet!
Spit it out!
He was standing near the
railway car...
Who was standing? Who was standing
there? Vasiliy?
A log slipped from the car
and "smash" it fell to the ground!
And one end banged Vasiliy on the head.
Smashed your Father,
Lyudka. That's it.
Vasiliy!
Damn it... That condition will
remain forever now.
- What will remain forever?
- A squint.
So he's alive?
Don't you croak, you silly goose!
'course he's alive,
but his left eye now looks this way
and the other one looks that way.
And what did you think?
I will show you what
we thought, oh you old fool!
Oh you!
Stop!
Stop, stop, stop!
- Not bad. Not bad indeed.
- And now you.
- Me?
- Yes, you.
- Well, announce the next act!
- Me? Announce?
Yes, the second act.
Go and announce it.
Act number two,
the sad one!
Hey, why are you here, you old geezer?
And that you dare!
Just wait until I get the broom,
you'll learn your lesson.
- Please, don't.
- Please, don't!
- Forgive me, Nadya.
- No way. I almost died of fear.
I'll tell Vasiliy all about it,
when he returns from the hospital.
That'll teach you!
- Nadya, do you have some brew?
- Sure we do, but not for you!
- Nadya, I feel sick.
- Poor thing! Look at him! Didn't have enough to drink?
I'll go and tell your wife how you
latch onto your neighbors for a drink.
Oh, but she's not with us anymore,
my dear Sasha, she's not!
That's it! She's gone...
Hm, I wonder, where has she
gone then?
I told her, let me call them.
But she went, "No, it'll pass. "
And then I saw
she started to blot.
- So I decided to disobey her and ran.
- Where to? What are you talking about?
I ran to fetch an ambulance.
And we went to the hospital on it.
And then the doctor
came out and said,
"Dear Grandpa,
your Grandma has died. "
Uncle Mitya, what is it all about?
How could this happen?
He told me that she has died.
I can't.
How could this be? I saw
her 2 days ago.
And yesterday she wanted to go
harvest potatoes
and, tellingly, with Filipov's family.
Then she's gone all bad. She went,
"I can't bend over, my heart aches. "
She told us, go on your own and
dig out those potatoes.
Why didn't you run to us
straight away?
It's only now that
I started to recover.
Before I couldn't bring myself
to an upright position.
I was trying to walk, but my
legs wouldn't hold me,
as if they were made of cotton wool.
My hands are still shaking.
Have a drink, Uncle Mitya,
have a drink.
No, don't bother!
- Please, drink.
- My dear Sasha disapproved of this.
Under these circumstances
you are allowed to, poor thing.
What was wrong with her.
Did the doctors tell you?
Miocardinal heart attack.
The scar was this big.
The autopsy showed.
- Eat something.
- No, thanks.
They'll bring her tomorrow.
In general, they are kept for 3 days
in morgue,
but there ain't no spaces.
- Can I expect some neighborly help from you?
- Sure, we'll help you.
- Lyudka, Aunty Sasha has died.
- It can't be.
Uncle Mitya took her yesterday to the
hospital, she died there. Heart failure.
Miocardinal heart attack, Lyudka.
- She wasn't that old.
- How old was she?
How old am I? Do the math,
she was 3 years younger.
So how old was she, Lyudka?
Lyonya! Grandma Sasha has died.
- Wow.
- Yesterday.
And, tellingly,
we loved each other.
Do you know, how she used to call me?
No one knows.
I'd call her Sanyushka and she'd
call me Mityunyushka.
I go: Sanyushka, and she goes:
Mityunyushka!
And such a voice, right, Nadya!
Oh, how she used to sing!
All those loud 'Oh's' and
'Ey's in the beginning...
<i>The moment of happiness
And moment of parting... </i>
<i>I am ready to share with you
All the time. </i>
<i>Let's shake
each other's hands, </i>
<i>And let's start this long journey
For many, many years!</i>
Are you done with the potatoes already?
What are you doing?
I'm telling them about my dream.
Those dreams can be pretty nasty.
Nadya, why have you
given him a drink?
Why do you pour him this thing?
What is he doing here? What's going on?
I just leave the yard and here he is at once,
getting himself plastered!
Run, Uncle Mitya!
- Aunty Sasha, he has buried you.
- What?
He says, "And tomorrow they'll bring her
from the morgue!"
Ugly scab!
Got you!
Our proud battleship
never surrenders to the foe!
Act number three...
A parting one.
I am leaving for a resort. And there
I'll go to a bar and will try a cocktail.
The new ones will have little ones soon,
take care so that cat doesn't get them.
Buy them some wheat.
I know. Dad, show me your trick.
- What trick?
- Give a pigeon water to drink.
Oh, this isn't any trick, this is training.
OK, bring me a mug.
Wow! It drinks! It isn't afraid!
There was once this Volodya,
a local fool.
He could make 5 of them
drink at once.
- A fool?
- Aha.
We loved him a lot,
all the villagers loved him.
Anyone could ask him
for help.
He'd come at once
and would work the hardest.
God didn't give him brains, but he had
a big soul and a lot of strength.
- He was murdered, poor thing.
- Who did that?
Some laborers. They were driven out of
the city and settled in our village.
In the early days they weren't settled here,
but then suddenly they were.
They didn't think twice,
started to drink and fight.
Volodya happened to see
one of the fights.
And as little kids do, he
started to wave a finger at them:
"This isn't a good thing to do,
you mischieves, why are you fighting?"
And those guys didn't think twice,
just took a knife and stabbed him.
There was an abandoned church,
and pigeons used to live in it.
Volodya started to feed them.
He used to go there
and crumb a loaf of bread for them.
They would fly around him, touch his
face and cheeks with their wings
and he would trill with laughter.
It was fun to watch.
They were not afraid of him, he didn't
scare them at all, unlike all others.
I remember that he had a red shirt,
all covered with little holes
from their small claws.
He was buried in that shirt.
While he was being buried,
they flew around his little grave.
And later, when everyone was gone,
they circled around it for a bit
and flew away.
We haven't seen them since.
They are darn smart, they are.
- Where is the health resort voucher?
- Jeez, I put it in the suitcase.
Where's the razor?
Oh, hello, Uncle Mitya.
Come in.
- Ah, don't worry. I'll stand here.
- Come in, come in.
Vasiliy, listen! Hide money here, in
this pocket, I've sewn it there.
What are you staring at?
Go away from here!
I am sorry, I didn't want to stand in
your way while you were hiding money.
Yeah, sure! Go and tell everyone
in the village about it,
you windbag!
So you understood, you'll put them
here and then secure it with a pin.
And if it comes undone?
Oh... It'll poke you.
- So what should I do? Sew it in in this hurry?
- I'll put it in my pocket.
Your pocket? Are you out of you mind?
They'll pick it out.
Don't you know those ruffians?
You wouldn't even notice!
Just wear it, no further ado!
I'll do it myself!
What's happened?
- What have you done?
- I've ironed it.
Who'll tie it now?
Well, I guess that's it.
No resort for me now.
Maybe Nikolai Trofimovich will help?
He does not wear ties!
Vasiliy, do not get upset just yet.
I'll find someone in a sec!
- I have a right to say goodbye to a friend.
- Again here with a bottle?
Customs check.
Well, Vasiliy, have an easy flight.
- Are you flying?
- I am. I'll see what pigeons see, when they're up above.
- What is that place called?
- The resort for locomotive organs.
I can't smell, Uncle Mitya.
Don't you worry,
I have bay leaves, we'll chew on them.
Are you some kind of agent provocateur
or what, Uncle Mitya?
Dad! Hello, Uncle Mitya! I got bread
and some canned food.
OK, put them there.
Hey, why are you still sitting?
The bus is coming!
- Let us have tea before the road.
- Yeah, I know this 'tea' of yours!
Lyudka, don't tell Mom.
Vasiliy, jiggers!
Jiggers!
Ha, and my handsome widower
is here, of course!
- So what did you find?
- Nothing. I went everywhere, no one knows.
I've had it! Unpack
my suitcase!
That's it!
Vasiliy, what's came over you?
Why the hell would you need it?
You'll just unbutton your shirt
like this...
- Unbutton!
- It's the South there!
There's a culture there! On TV
they say it's a cultural stronghold.
Give it to me.
Oh, Lyudka, oh, you beauty!
I tie it differently.
Well, let's say goodbye
to our Dad.
Regards and see you later.
Well, Daughter... This is nothing.
I'll be back soon.
- Write us something.
- I'll write you something.
- Shall we kiss?
- Kiss? Those ideas of yours.
Now watch out there,
at those resorts...
- Write to me, don't forget.
- Bring me some sea shells...
and a palm.
- Oh, Daughter, a palm? How would I carry it?
- Just a branch!
Ah, a branch!
OK.
Goodbye and all the best!
Take care, comrade! You've splashed
water all over me!
I am all wet now, from top to toe!
I'm sorry!
- Oh, hello.
- What is the matter?
You work in our personnel department,
in administration.
- Comrade Kuzkin?
- Yep, Kuzyakin.
- Vladimir Valentinovich?
- Yep, Vasiliy Egorovich.
I have a professional memory. So you're
the one who got the 2nd resort voucher?
The world is so small!
No, no, get out first.
As you order.
Who could have thought! To be thousands
kilometers from home
and to meet a work colleague
in the sea.
Excuse me, have you come here after
sustaining an injury as well?
God no! I was advised about the
benefits of this climate by my mentalist.
- Menta who?
- List. She foretells future!
Haven't you heard about it?
I'm busy all the time
with my work.
Strange... All the papers
write about it all the time now.
- What's that? That's her job?
- No, she works in a different field.
By the way, speaking of work.
How's your plan?
Our plan? It's alright.
We're fulfilling the plan.
Your Forestry is in our good books.
We're very satisfied with your work.
Thank you very much.
Just one second, please!
I'll read the front page.
<i>[song] And the heart is breaking... </i>
<i>into small parts when I
recall my home... </i>
- Hello, Ms Raisa!
- Hello! So we're neigbors on top of everything.
Excuse me!
She took a shoe,
a regular shoe,
lifted it by the laces
and let it go.
The shoe remained hanging
in the air.
Ms Raisa, how's that possible?
Telekinesis. The movement of objects
with only the help of the gaze.
Presently this phenomenon is studied
by many mentalists and laboratories.
Well, not officially yet. But genetics
wasn't recognized as well, you remember?
But the progress is inexorable.
Do you agree with me?
Precisely.
You see the dwarf Japanese
mandarin trees...
- I will introduce you to her, but please, be discrete!
- I'll be silent as the grave!
Because as soon as they discover
mentalists, they register them.
They work on the state scale,
foresee what happens abroad.
If anything happens the Government
turns to the mentalist immediately.
Then mentalist sends an inquiry into
space: if this and that, then what?
And the answer is transmitted
via the astral bodies.
- And only after this the Government
makes a decision.  - Really?
But this is very ruinous for mentalists,
their nervous system can become a wreck.
Well, no wonder! To think
for the Government every day!
16 humanoids were found
on the site of the crash.
They were short, 1 meter 20 cm
on average,
green and sexless.
You know, their eyes were
really wise and sad.
Oh, have you seen
them, Ms Raisa?
Have I seen them?
No one has seen them.
After a minute in the sun
they melted.
- Really?
- Really! They turned into these 16 spots.
Don't let it pass your lips,
it's classified!
- I got it! I'll be silent as a grave!
- We and the Americans conceal it,
but we've both been communicating
with them for a long time.
- With whom?
- With the aliens, the humanoids.
It is a proven fact that people
descended from them.
They just agreed to write in the
textbooks that we descended from
monkeys! Crazy!
Silence, remedial sleep!
I brought her a picture
of another person.
He had disappeared,
all of a sudden, somehow.
She looked at the picture carefully,
went to the map...
And what happened, Ms Raisa?
What happened next, she went
to the map, and?
She pointed her finger and said:
this is a hot spot,
he's there now.
Excuse me, Ms Raisa.
Did they find him?
- Did they find that chap?
- Who?
I asked did they find that chap?
This electrosleep, I must tell you,
is as if something from the Stone Age!
Not to compare with the Eastern medicine,
but do you know how they do it there?
Ping with the needle, squirt, and
that's it. But this doesn't work.
Yep, true, for me, my head cracks
and that's it. Nothing more.
Excuse me please...
Aha...
This is some strange kind of apples.
How much are these?
Lyonya asked to get him
batteries for the radio,
And I need to get a present for Olya.
Oh, I love you, I love you, Olya...
Is that your wife, Olya?
No, Olya is my younger daughter,
and Nadya is my wifey.
Nadya... That's a beautiful name.
Excuse me, and what is
your husband's name?
Who?
Oh, no! I value my freedom,
so that you know!
- Marriage is voluntary slavery.
- Really?
And who bought you this tie?
Oh, my wifey bought it.
I recommend you to buy this one. It goes
well with your suit and with you eyes.
<i>[song] After patting little children's heads</i>
<i>I will say in tears... </i>
He asks, "So you can't stand
it anymore?"
- She says, "I can't. "
- These were her exact words?
"I'll try to help you. "
He took her to his office,
took off her clothes,
laid her down on the table.
And then, with his bare hands,
no sharp instruments,
opened her body. They have their
secrets, the skin parted on its own.
"Does it hurt?" he asked.
"No, I feel good. "
He took out all her inner organs...
and put them in a bowl.
He washed them there really well, almost
scrubbed, and then rinsed.
Son of a biscuit!
Bang! And threw everything that
was aching to the garbage bin!
So our doctors can't do that?
Well, this is special
Philippino medical practice.
Ms Raisa, and that hussy,
is she alive?
But of course!
And feels very well.
But she doesn't recognize people.
She lost her memory for some reason.
But the important thing is not the
result, but the process.
Yeah, I understand you.
- Did I tire you?
- Oh no, not at all! I learned so much!
I wouldn't have learned about all this
in my entire life otherwise.
- Do you know what question bothers me?
- What is it, Ms Raisa?
How did it happen that you and I
both happened to be here together,
under this charming southern sky?
How did it happen, Vasiliy?
Well, it's because of health resort vouchers, we work at the same place.
Oh, you are not a romantic, Vasiliy
Egorovich, you are not.
<i>[song] Remember those mountains,
Remember those palm trees,</i>
<i>But you should forget my address
once and for all. </i>
<i>But the eternity comes to an end, </i>
<i>And the parting comes, </i>
<i>And the time for farewell</i>
<i>Is coming nearer
and nearer. </i>
<i>Let's look</i>
<i>Into each other's eyes. </i>
<i>Let's dance, </i>
<i>Let's dance!</i>
<i>For the last time. </i>
Swimming! Let's go swimming,
Vasiliy!
- Oh, you have dropped something!
- Let's take the clothes off!
Oh, the stars of the world!
[inscription] Vasiliy, be careful!
- They're shining!
And the moon is swinging...
Yeah, swaying a lot.
- Tell, me, Vasiliy, am I drunk?
- You're fine, we just had a tiny drop.
Thank you a lot. You are
a very kind person.
And everything is good with you,
your family, your kids.
You live in harmony, don't you?
- Well, different things happen.
- You don't look like a troublemaker.
- Well, I am not.
- Your wife?  - Yep.
- Nadya...   - It's all because of the
pigeons, because of small stuff.
That is sad, very sad.
- You breed pigeons?
- Yeah.
How cute!
Pigeons!
Ms Raisa! Ms Raisa!
What's wrong?
I do not do this for sale,
I do it for the soul. Did I offend you?
You know, as a kid I was a crazy
mischief! A real tomboy.
My Dad wanted to have a son,
but a girl was born.
- And what was her name?
- Whose?  - Well, that girl's?
- Raisa.
- Oh, I don't get this...
My Dad wanted a boy, but a girl
was born, I was born!
Yes, I understood.
My Dad... My Dad...
- Do you know who was my Dad?
- No.
- He was in the cavalry, an officer!
- Oh, yeah... Got it.
We also used to chase pigeons.
And I used to...
I never knew how to whistle.
And you know how to do it.
But I was always surprised by a different thing:
how tender these stupid birdies
can be!
Why human beings are so different?
Why, Vasiliy?
Exactly!
- And she says to me, "Where is the money?"
- And where was the money?
Oh, I've bought
a couple of pigeons.
Oh, they're smart,
the feathered tribe!
You take a pigeon and let him go up,
towards the clouds, to the flock,
and it becomes so tiny, not bigger
than a match head,
but you keep the female dove. And then you
just raise your hand and wave,
and he throws himself at her like
a stone and starts cooing at her.
- How can you explain it?
- Well, a procreation instinct most likely.
It's love.
Most probably...
- Oh, love, dear Vasiliy Egorovich...
- Raisa Zakharovna...
[inscription] Oh, Vasiliy,
how could you...
I think I feel well,
but I'm not sure yet.
I've gathered a lot of sea shells for Olya,
they take up the whole nightstand.
I'll cut the palm branch before
leaving, otherwise it may whither.
I've bought a lot of batteries for
Lyonya's radio.
Sounds good!
All in all, the things you've asked
for - I've got them all!
Dear Nadya!
Please excuse me that...
What's that, Lyudka? It looks
like this is someone else's hand.
Dear Nadya! Please excuse me that
I interfere,
but Vasiliy is a very timid
and delicate person.
That's why it is difficult for
him to make a decision.
On the shores of this wonderful sea
- Vasiliy and I have found each other.
- What's that?
Vasiliy and them have found each other.
It has happened unexpectedly,
as if by obsession.
We are still at a little bit of a loss.
But God's ways are mysterious
and no one knows what kind of trials
await us. One thing is sure, we won't
be able to live without each other.
Lyudka, I don't understand. Who is that
person writing, is it his roommate?
This ain't a roommate,
this is a woman.
Please, don't be afraid, I'm not against
him communicating with his children.
I believe that you, being an
intelligent person, will not condemn us
for this little ray of happiness in the
dark sky of life. Please forgive us.
Sincerely yours, Raisa Zakharovna.
P. S. Thank you for Vasiliy.
- What's this, Lyudka? What does P. S. mean?
- Post scriptum. Afterword.
- Thank you for Vasiliy.
- Thank who?  - You! For Vasiliy!
Oh, wait! Here he wrote again!
Nadya, we fly back
home on the 4th.
- What day is it today?
- 11th.
Well, they must have arrived by now.
So do not write to this address.
I wouldn't be able to tell this
to you, a letter is better.
And Ms Raisa a is a good woman.
She even helped to chose the presents.
Goodbye, Vasiliy.
Oh, woe is me!
Oh, what have I done to deserve this!
Lyonya, what is that?! Isn't he ashamed,
the pig? What a stud!
Do you see what kind of
a stud your Dad is!
- Why do you cry?!
- I don't know what to do!
Oh, woe is me!
- Lyonya, have you fed the piglets?
- Yes.
I will tear away the heads of his
pigeons! Lyudka, where is our axe?
I will definitely do it,
you damn stud!
But what do pigeons
have to do with this?
So it is alright to torture
your Mom? Is it?
We brought you up!
Do you think it was easy?
If I meet him, I'll kill him,
but pigeons have nothing to do with it.
- What do you mean, you'll kill him?
- What an idiot.
Hey, Lyonya! Are you insane?
Don't even think about it!
Grabbing him by the back of
his neck and shaking him well will do!
- Hey, sit down! Where are you going?
- I'm going to the outhouse.
- I'll go with you!
- Are you out of your mind?
- Well, I'll just guard you.
- I am going to the outhouse!
I know this story!
If you do what you think of
you'll end up in jail and
your life will never be right again!
My dear Lyonya, please be patient, maybe
he will come back!
Are you all out of your minds?
Hello!
Hello!
- Are you Nadya?  - Yes.
- I came to talk to you.
- And where are you from?
- I am from the administration.
Good afternoon, please, come in.
Oh, a samovar! How cute.
- Such a grief has befallen us!
- Mother, cut it out!
- Excuse me!
- Thank you.
- Oh, I'll go get tea ready.
- Please don't bother!
- And who are you in the administration?
- I work in the personnel department.
Why do you look after your
personnel so badly?
They run wherever they want!
And you don't care!
Well, you know, in general we
do not have any personnel turnover.
But we do! A horrible turnover
happened to us!
You should reprimand him real good,
ream that fool out.
Mom, maybe she's here on
a different issue?
Ah no, precisely because
of this very issue.
Don't you have anything
else to do? Go!
Excuse us.
Lyonya, hey, come back!
Where are you going?
- To feed the piglets.
- Well, listen here, don't you even think about it!
- Oh, he says that he's gonna kill him!
- Whom?  - His Father!
He's very quiet, but then he gets a
thing into his stupid head, and I worry.
Well, this is certainly not a way out.
- How can one think this way!
- Sure!  - He's his Father!
He found some other woman, that bastard,
and that's the last we saw of him!
I was told about the things
that happen at those resorts.
How those loose women get there?
Why do you give them resort vouchers?
Nadya, we both
are women.
Yep.
- I want us to understand each other.
- Yes, yes.
- It is not that bad.
- How come? It is really bad.
Please, calm yourself down.
- Do you love him?
- Huh?
Do you love this man?
He ain't no man! If he were a man,
he wouldn't have done this!
This bitch set the trap for him,
and that fool let himself be tricked.
Why do you think that he was tricked,
maybe he tricked her?
Oh, don't talk nonsense! A good
woman would never do such a thing.
You'll see, it will come back to haunt her!
God has a lot on his mind,
but God is not blind!
She will repent a thousand times...
... this snake for taking
husbands from their families!
Why do you say she has
hundreds of them?!
Well, you ain't saying he's
her 1st one and that she's 16?
No, she' not 16!
And he's not her 1st.
What if this is love, Nadya?
- How do you mean, love?
- I mean, real love!
This is what you should have thought
about in the 1st place, dear Nadya!
Oh, I don't know...
We have lived so many years with
him without fighting and all was good.
- What if it was all a habit?
- What do you mean, a habit?   - Just simply a habit.
That is why I ask you:
do you love this man?
Oh, I don't know.
You say all these different words...
What love can I talk about,
when I don't have enough air,
I can't breathe,
it burns in my chest,
as if I swallowed hot coals
from the oven.
Nadya, dear,
do not hold anything against Vasiliy.
If you love him, you won't hurt him.
I understand that it is difficult
for the heart to accept it.
But we are people and we have
rea... son.
What's the matter?
- Why are you looking at me in this way?
- So it is you, huh?
It is me, Nadya,
what is your patronymic?
Oh, what's this world coming to?
- Lyudka, aye, Lyudka!
- What?
- Just look what's happening! It's her!
- How do you do, Lyuda.
Do you intend to make a scandal?
I came to you, Madame, because I
deemed you to be an intelligent woman.
- Oh you little bleached bitch!
- What do you mean, bleached?
This is my natural hair color!
As far as I understand, our meeting
has come to an end.
Thank you for your attention.
We'll discuss this situation
with Vasiliy
and we'll inform you about the
results in written form.
Goodbye, Lyuda.
goodbye, Nadya.
No need to see me off.
Live happily.
Oh you, I'll show you...
Girls, restrain your Mother!
Calm down, stay calm.
Oh what a pest!
"Lyudka, aye, Lyudka!"
Pooh, what a boor!
What was that? What is happening?
I tell her everything from the
bottom of my heart...
And she turns out to be...
her...
If I get to know that any of you
see your Dad,
I'll curse you.
Good afternoon!
- Good afternoon!
- Hello!... Miss.
Hello, my friend.
Will you have some lunch...
Ma'am?
Grated cheese, beetroot...
A little bit more. Like this.
Oh Jesus...
- I see that!
- I wanted to add a little bit of salt.
Otherwise it isn't possible
to swallow it.
By no means! Salt is
a white poison.
- Isn't sugar a white poison?
- Sugar is a sweet poison.
- Ms Raisa, maybe some bread?
- Bread is a poison!
Oh, I wouldn't mind getting poisoned
by a good slice of bread!
It's true. I wouldn't mind
getting stuffed real good!
- Getting stuffed? What's wrong with 'eat'?
- Eh? - Not 'eh', but 'excuse me'!
Ms Raisa!
Don't be so tragic about it!
Raisa, really! Please, stop!
Excuse me, my dear.
I was really hurt today.
- Well... Eat, eh?
- Elegy.
Massenet?
Come here, my beloved one, sit
down and give me your hand.
Like this... And let us be silent.
- Why are people so cruel?
- Who?
Why, oh why,
oh why?
But people are different, Raisa.
Oh my, I haven't done
anything bad to her!
- Raisa, please, eat.
- Honey, you're hungry?
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.
Oh, the barrier is insurmountable.
No understanding for our love!
Moreover, I almost got killed.
Those people just stood there, watched.
Vasiliy, those were your children!
Such aloofness!
- Raisa, you didn't go to Nadya, did you?
- Yes I did.
I stumbled upon a wall of egotism,
hate and lack of understanding.
- Why did you go there?
- I wanted to establish contact.
You're a shy person... but you'll
have to deal with it on your own.
Careful, honey, or you'll spoil both
the needle and Massenet.
- Alright then, I'm leaving.
- No, wait, we have to decide.
No, there is nothing to decide.
I am leaving.
- Where to?
- Some place. I have packed already.
- You mean you are leaving altogether?
- Yep.
- What about me?
- Why do you need me, Raisa?
I don't know how to wash
socks and shirts.
But you've learned.
- I curse!
- I like it! It is risque.
I got used to it. If you want...
Doodle-poodle! I will start too!
No, please, don't. I can't, Ms Raisa!
I am drawn to them.
- Drawn to whom?
- To Nadya, to the kids.
- So you're going to that Gorgon?
- Ah no, I'm going to my wife.
- What about me?
- Ms Raisa, I really can't...
I will not let you go, Vasiliy!
I will not let you go!
What is this, really,
Miss, what's going on?
I wanted it all to be good,
good for people.
What's the matter?
Vasiliy, Vasiliy!
You are my happiness, my destiny,
you are my love!
If you want, I can learn how to bake
pies, I like them myself.
I will wash everything by myself,
do you want that?
Tell me what you want me
to become! I'll be that!
Raisa, really, why are you
acting like in the movies?
Vasiliy, don't you believe me?
Ms Raisa, please, let me go!
Dear Vasiliy, please, do not kill me.
We are from different social strata,
- but destiny brought us together.
- Destiny? What are you talking about?
One night at the bar barred my way back!
What do you mean, at the bar?!
Oh, what a foolish woman I am!
Calm down. What do you want
from me, for God's sake?
- You've thrown yourself upon me out of boredom!
- Me? On you?
Well, who else? Being all alone all
the time... It ain't no fun, for sure!
- Leave us alone!
- Oh, yeah, this is the right decision!
- Get out of my house!
- Oh, this is the real thing now!
- Please leave us alone!
- I just wanted a better life!
- Get out from my house! Leave us alone!
- Sure, all right!
So what do the cards say?
Vasiliy will come, he will for sure!
The road is for Nadya, not for him.
Nadya will go somewhere.
But this anger here...
- Well, anger, sure! Is there a reason to rejoice?
- Oh, go away!
Mom, maybe you should
get out of bed?
Yeah, Nadya, come on,
stretch your legs.
Just do one small thing,
then the other.
Just switch your mind to the chores!
Oh, let me stay in bed
for just a tiny bit more.
A tiny bit? It has been 2 days already.
Come on! Get up! You can't
go on like this, Mom!
You'll leave for the city, Lyonya will
get conscripted into the army...
If I die, do not forget
about Olya,
take her with you...
Sure thing! Hello, what are you
talking about?
Oh, those city dwellers...
Sasha, don't lose touch with
reality.
What does the city
have to do with this?
Where did he want to go,
remind me?
Oh Jeez, well, to the bar! Bar!
How can I get him
this bar here?
Ah, after a couple of bar-crawlings
he'll crawl back to you!
OK, get up!
- Nadya, get up, really!
- Come on!
Hey, you may get used to lying
and then die for real!
Legs...
- Alright, we're sitting.
- Don't act like a child.
So we're siting, good,
we're sitting.
What a sponger!
See, Olya, you used to defend
your Dad! See what kind of man he is!
Don't harass the kid!
I'd murder him,
I wish he were dead!
Nadya, you've lost your mind
completely! What is it? Lost your mind!
Mother!
Yeah, you two always had some secrets.
Now he'll make you more
siblings and you'll see!
Your bad Mom is here,
at home,
and your goody Daddy
is who knows where!
- Got himself another Mom. So go to her!
- Mommy, dear!
Yeah, go to her, she's no doubt
all kind and nice, does not scold!
Stop it! You're totally
crazy and insane!!
Yeah, yell at your mother,
she hasn't had enough yet!
How should I not yell at you?
Stop crying!
Look what you're
doing to yourself!
I am doing it to myself!
Sure, Mom is bad!
- Who told you that you're bad?
- No one! I scold myself.
I am not blind. You all think
that Dad... All because of me...
- I am not blind!
- You've gone mad!
Sure, Mom is foolish
and nasty!
But when the trouble came to you in your city to whom did you run to, sweetie?
If I knew you'd reproach me
for that...
You ran to your Mother,
remember?
Remember what you told me?
How you cried in my lap?
And now Mom is foolish and bad,
Vasiliy has left me.
So you too,
just leave me!
Run wherever you want!
Nadya, enough, enough.
What are you doing?
Nadya, what is she doing?
Let her scram wherever!
Lyuda, what is this?
What's wrong with you both?
Thank you, Mom! Thank you!
I've come, I haven't worked,
just plagued you with my presence!
Who would have liked that!
I have holidayed here long enough,
time to go.
Lyuda, Lyuda! What has come
over you? Jesus Christ!
I held them so dear, Aunty Sasha,
I thought I had a home, my home!
I came to complain about my darn life
and it turns out that I did it
only because of my troubles!
Well, calm down! If you're distressed
you say things you don't mean!
That's enough! I'm not made of stone!
How to go on? I know nothing.
I have ran away from my husband
and now my Dad has run away...
Lyuda, don't leave!
Lyudka, forgive me, I am a fool,
please, forgive.
Oh, the flood is coming.
And you! How much of my blood
have you drunk?
You are always giving me trouble!
Who was sneaking out trough the
back door to go see Daria Usvyatskaya?
I told you, I went to get
some cucumbers.
Sure, you had to get some cucumbers!
Have you stomached
those cucumbers all right?
And what about Manya Zykova?
- Tell me that you weren't eyeing her!
- You were!  - You men are all the same!
What has gotten into you...
All this rage...
- You're drinking too much, Uncle Mitya!
- Yes, I don't know where to hide...
What has that got to do with anything?
You better be quiet, Uncle Mitya!
Oh, Daddy!
Holy Moly, Vasiliy!
So where is this handsome lad
coming from?
Have you forgotten anything?
Have you come to tell us something?
Oh, look at him! What's wrong with
your eyes? Did you get an 'F' at school?
How's life?
How's our young bride?
I improved her hairdo a bit when
she came over, was she upset?
Why do you keep quiet,
Uncle Vasiliy?
Well, you can be silent,
if you want.
Vasiliy, you're a good man! How can
you not be ashamed to do this?
Uncle Mitya, have you got
matches?
Could you spare me one?
You came for a visit
or what?
I don't know how
they will receive me.
Your lover doesn't give you money
for matches! Good life!
Don't try to pick on me, Nadya,
I came to talk things over, calmly...
Oh, look at him! I pick on him!
Did you know that I ripped your
pigeons' noggins off? Totally!
- What are you talking about?
- Hey, Lyonya, don't let him in!
Let me in! Lyonya!
I will cut their heads off.
You won't be able to stop me!
Lyonya, would you really
not let me in?
- And who are you?
- Hey! How do you talk to your Father!
Lyonya, what's wrong with you?
I am your Father!
Look at him!
- Take off your pants!
- Yeah, sure! Aren't we too fast?
Take off your pants, I told you!
Hitting your own Father!
- Have I ever hit you in your life?
- Why did you hurt Mom?
Why have you come?
Why did you hurt Mom?
- Have you seen the state she's in?
- Well, I saw...
Ah, you saw? You saw?
Lyonya, what's gotten into you, hey?
At your own Father?!
Well, go on, son, go on!
Go on, chop it off, Sonny!
Put an end to your Father!
- Daddy!
- Go on, chop it off!
Hey, hey, sweet girl, you'll strangle
me, be careful!
Chop it off, sonny!
- I will never forgive you!
- Daddy!
What have you done to Mom?
How could you?
- I will never forgive you!
- Go on, chop it off!
Sonny! Go away!
Lyonya, what has come into you?
You have hit me, I never
laid a finger on you!
Go away! Go away!
- Nadya, don't cry!
- Go away from here!
- Why did Lyonya do that?
- Go away!
Oh, don't tear me apart, Jesus!
- I will never forgive him for that!
- Go away from here!
All right, calm down,
that's enough.
Well, go away now.
Go!
- I understand... Nadya, forgive me.
- Don't come closer!
I wanted all to be better.
You created trouble and now
you're complaining.
Why did he come upon me with an axe!
What was he doing!
Leave it be.
- Nadya, I still have money left...
- Go and choke on it!
Aha, OK, alright.
Tellingly, Lyonya hasn't approved
your actions.
Well, yes, I was wrong.
But why the axe?
Well, that was foolish.
When Lyonya took that axe,
I thought I'd give birth.
- Where is?  - Who?
- That axe.
- Lyudka threw it into the garden.
- Oh. I'll go hide it.
- Aunty Sasha, run to him, to Vasiliy.
- Why?
Tell him...
that I'll wait for him
near the old ferry.
What do you mean?
Did you see? He was all white
and then red spots all over.
He's distressed as well for sure.
He's punished himself.
Do not cry. I'll go.
Put this away.
I caught up with him.
He stood there shaking.
I told him and he nodded. He nodded
his head, yes he did.
He was silent.
- He'll wait for you the day after tomorrow.
- I won't go!
What?
Nothing.
Look at him, went to a resort and
turned into a lover-boy!
I felt sorry in the beginning,
stupid me.
But now not anymore! He'll find
himself another one, now he knows how.
Nadya, what is this?
You'll be like that at odds forever?
Nadya, he's a good man, he doesn't drink
and works hard!
Will you find someone like him? No!
Oh, damn them all!
I don't need anyone!
When Mitya starts badgering me,
I can't hold it! I feel such pity for him!
And you, you're young, why
should you suffer?
I won't go!
So just sit here! From now on I'm
also at odds with you.
You have no pity neither for the
children, nor for him, nor for yourself.
After I die I'll invite Vasiliy to the
funeral banquet, but I won't let you in!
I won't go!
So, Vasiliy, here I am.
You're here!
So what will you tell me now?
- How's Lyonya?
- He's alright! Says, he'll kill you.
He'll kill me? Well, alright.
- Nadya, dear, maybe let's sit down?
- Let's sit down.
Sit down, Nadya, dear.
Sit down.
Wait! Just a moment!
I have a newspaper.
Like so. Yeah, sit down.
It's getting chilly.
You've brought
some vodka with you or what?
I did! Just a second.
- All armed and prepared, ha?
- No... If you don't... I...
Oh, alright, pour it!
- Are we to look at it now?
- Just a second.
Wait... Just a sec.
Some snacks.
Go on!
- What's that? Have a bite!
- Don't drink too much.
Just a tiny bit.
- Oh, son of a gun!
- What?
Nadya, dear, I feel mighty
shitty without you.
I'm a fool...
Well, if you don't need pigeons,
to hell with them, I'll chase them away.
Fiddle sticks!
I'm as restless as an insomniac bear,
my mind is wondering
somewhere all the time.
- Life is such a...
- Oh, stop complaining!
Why did I muck about
with those pigeons...
It has rushed into your head,
so you were mucking about.
- What are you talking about!
- Nothing! Such a shame!
All men are like real men and this one
races over the roofs with the teenagers.
I was so ashamed I couldn't look
people in the eyes!
You'd like it more if I wasted my time
playing cards?
I didn't say that. Those guys play poker
like crazy every evening after work,
you race over the roofs, what's the
difference? Both are addictions!
Why are you blabbering,
if you don't know?
Oh, but you understand all the knowledge!
Your brain is so big that it
sticks out from your ears!
Go to that resort girlie and tell her,
I do not need to be taught!
What does this have to do with it?
What's it got to do? They were healing
their locomotive system! My ass!
If only someone cut off those
limbs of yours,
so that you couldn't do all
those stupid things you did!
You've made a mess and now
you regret it, I see that.
I go home from the market,
all shivering.
I come near gates and think
that you're not there,
so what is there for me to do?
Nadya, I wasn't thinking!
I'll die, Nadya.
Nadya, I'll die for you, not for myself.
Let them cut me into pieces...
as long as you live.
I hurt you. I am ready to pay for it,
with anything.
With my life, if you want!
Nadya, forgive me, please,
forgive me!
- Vasiliy, dear!
- Nadya, dear!
Vasiliy, dear, what are you doing?
Right here, right now? People will see us!
I woke up in the morning and cooked
this for you while the kids were asleep!
Eating at the canteen
isn't much fun.
I almost bumped into Lyonya.
I think he hasn't noticed.
Jeez...
I met Aunt Sasha in the street.
She was smiling.
I asked her why and she said
that if I were happy, she was happy too.
- Maybe she has learned that we see each other?
- But how?
- Maybe somebody told her?
- But who knows about it?
- Maybe she read it from your face?
- My face?
You now, I really try to frown
when I am with other people.
Well, you can try as hard as you like,
but your eyes, they're sparkling!
Eat up, eat!
- Finish your food first.
- Well, I did.
You behave as if we were on a honeymoon
again. Where does this energy come from?
Calm down, you crazy!
I'll scream!
Oh, you crazy!
Get off me!
- Ah, maybe it was good that she was in our life.
- Who?
That marriage-wrecker,
that ratty Raisa of yours!
Why do you have to start again?
We lived and worked,
while misfortune
was lurking behind our gates like a dog.
But maybe it wasn't misfortune,
if it has shown me the truth.
What has it shown you?
How much I love you,
how much you love me,
what wonderful kids we have.
But our kids are really wonderful,
for sure!
You're right, Vasiliy.
I hadn't thought before that you can
just disappear!
I have never thought about it!
And now I think about everything:
about war,
about those rotten capitalists.
Oh, Vasiliy, what do they
want from us?
Well, as if there's nothing
better to think about.
- The war is...  - What is it?
- It's a marriage-wrecker too!
One gives birth and doesn't
know what awaits that child!
What kind of life will they have?
How will their fate be decided?
- Giving birth is not our concern anymore!
- Don't be so sure!
Whoa!
Yeah!
In the beginning I couldn't understand.
Then I got scared.
And now I don't know what to think.
Holy Moly, dear mother... .
- What a thing to do!
- Well, it was you who did it.
Well, we both did it, Nadya!
Oh, Nadya, my dove!
This is what it does!
This is what love does!
Nadya, let me kiss you!
Oh, get off, Vasiliy!
Vasiliy, I am afraid. What will people
say? That I went crazy in my old age...
Oh, let them talk! You are younger
than those youngsters nowadays!
Let those youngsters try!
They will bloody fail!
- Vasiliy, dear, it is 2 months!
- How do you know?
What do you mean? We've been hiding here
for 2 months already.
Enough! We've been underground enough,
we need to come out!
- People will laugh at us!
- No they won't! My wife is pregnant!
Stop running to those dates, you'll
catch a cold and what am I to do then?
Nadya, quit it and go home!
- You'll be cold.
- Nah, don't worry, it's warmer now.
- Is the smoke OK?
- Just exhale sideways.
What, you can't hold anymore?
Go and coo to them.
Oh, Nadya... Let me
finish this cigaret first.
Well, go, I tell you!
- Well, well.  - It drinks! It remembers!
- Interesting!
Will it drink from me?
Let's try! Get some water.
But don't laugh, Nadya,
don't laugh.
- Why are you laughing?
- And why did you say not to laugh?
Get some water. Move closer
to the pigeon
and coo a bit.
Push water, push it!
Nadya, what?
A bird and yet not afraid. Amazing!
- Mom, where are you?
- Could it be Lyonya?
Why is he so early?
What should we do now?
- Quiet! I'll slip through the backyard.
- Backyard? Without your pants?
Fiddle sticks!
I told you, get dressed, but no!
"It's warm now, it's warm!"
But it really is warmer, Nadya!
- Stay put.
- Yep.
Lyonya, aye, Lyonya!
I'm here. You've come already?
Go get me some water, if you're here.
Well, there is a whole tub full
in the bathhouse.
- Where?
- I filled it yesterday.
I wanted to do the washing today.
- Well, use it.
- Lyonya...
Mom, go and fetch Dad.
Stop hiding!
Who's hiding, I wonder!
If I only met him...
- It's OK, I saw him!
- Where?
- Near the river. And you were kissing!
- You and your imagination.
- I'm being conscripted into the army.
- Who?   - Take a guess.
- When?
- Tomorrow at 7 am.
- What about health examination?
- I passed.  - Why didn't you tell me?
When could I? You're too busy
being in love.
- What branch of service will you go to, Sonny?
- Border guards.
It's quiet there right now!
Sure, quiet!
- Well, tell her?
- What should I tell her, Sonny?
To stop crying!
Stop crying! Get the table
ready, quick.
Oh, my Sonny!
Let her get over it a bit.
- We probably should call Mitya and Aunt Sasha.
- I'll do that!
Dad!
Put on your trousers.
Oh, fiddle sticks!
Bah! Well, I wanted to get
a bathhouse going...
- Who else is conscripted with you?
- Sashka Buldanov, Vitka Roisen, Vovka.
- Filimonov?
- We'll all be on the same team!
Oh, that's good! You won't be bored.
You'll help each other!
Son, run to the store and buy what's
necessary, we'll buy more if needed.
And some bread! Run, Sonny!
Dad, there is a broom,
behind the bathhouse on the wall.
And you were afraid.
One has to understand!
See, what a fine lad we've brought up!
And now look at me.
And look at you! Buttons!
You're not a proper soldier!
In the army they'll give you
45 seconds during the operational alert.
Troopers.
Lyonya, what's wrong with you?
Don't interrupt! He's going through
basic military training!
Daughter, go and do your stuff!
Don't interrupt us!
OK, say goodbye to your bottom.
Your head!
Get flat! You need to
be flat!
When I was serving,
the officer would put up a rope,
if one touched it with the bum -
extra duty.
When I was serving, they were putting
barbed wire... The Germans...
If anyone touched it, a mine
would explode...
It ain't your extra duty!
Why don't you dance?
The old people are dancing
and you are sitting!
Come on, Vasiliy,
come on!
- Dad, lets have the pigeons fly for a farewell!
- Yes, let's do it!
Sonny, while you're there see to it
that no pest gets into our lands...
Drop it! No one will attack us!
Don't panic!
- But they did!
- Yeah, they did, but we showed them!
Well, your brother will go
and serve in the army,
but we'll provide you with another one.
Dad, what are you talking about!
Olya, don't listen to him!
Oh come on!
Everyone knows it already.
Sasha, maybe we too should go
and make us a Snow White?
Oh, be quiet, you carpenter!
What are you doing, crazy heads?
You'll fall!
- I don't see them! Where are they, Olya?
- Above your head. Look right above you.
- Show her to him 'cause he won't see.
- Nah, let them rise a little bit higher
He lost us. You've waited
too long.
Oh, my neck!
- That's enough. Vasiliy, let's have a drink.
- Nah, Uncle Mitya.
He understands that she's here.
What would he be without her?
There he is!
He's coming! Look everyone!
He's flying here!
Oh, life!
Like a stone, like a stone!
Oh my God...
That's all, folks.
That's all...
That's all
