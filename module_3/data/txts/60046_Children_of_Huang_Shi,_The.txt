lf you're not back here by 9:00
tomorrow night, l'll go without you.
Okay.
Good luck, Eddie.
Okay. Okay. Okay. l'm sorry. Okay.
<i>Writing from a ruined building.
A truckload of Japanese troops outside.</i>
<i>The city is quiet.</i>
l liked Tokyo very much.
l was there for three months...
l met some nice people.
They were... very kind.
China. So many things to draw.
But l draw very badly.
Would you care for more tea, Mr. Hogg?
l'm fine, thank you.
You are safe now.
What's your name?
What is your nationality?
British?
-And you're a journalist?
-How did you know that?
Nobody but a journalist
would walk into Nanjing
armed with nothing but a sports coat.
What is this place? What's going on?
Who are you?
lt's the Tax Office.
And my name is Chen. Hansheng Chen.
-Hansheng Chen?
-Call me Jack, why don't you.
So, why were they going to kill you?
The Japs usually
leave British nationals alone.
-l saw something l shouldn't have.
-Got it.
l took photographs. They found them.
No wonder.
Pardon my ignorance,
but what are you doing in the Tax Office?
They're killing people out there.
We are completely outnumbered here,
and the Japs are better armed,
so we are going to fight another day.
Hold this.
But before we go,
we're going to blow up a few buildings.
They are very orderly, the Japanese.
They hate it
when we blow up a city's records.
Thank you.
We'll try for the British consulate.
They may be able to get you out of Nanjing.
You have to leave.
You have to tell the world
what's happening here.
l love this part.
Come on. Your friends should be this way.
Take it easy, Daisy.
l have a pass.
-l have a pass in my pocket.
-Shoot him!
There's nothing we can do.
-Shoot him!
-You're too reckless, George.
Shoot him.
Shoot him.
Shoot him.
Hey.
You were hit pretty bad.
Was l? l didn't feel a thing.
Must've been the cold numbing the pain.
Most of your blood's
gone down the Yangtze.
But l decided you'll live.
l hope you're going to thank him
for saving your life.
Thank you once again.
She was talking to me. Right, Lee?
So, you're an Oxford man.
-What?
-You talk a lot in your sleep.
What about you?
You didn't learn your English at Berlitz,
if l may say so.
West Point.
l thought you were a Communist.
l am. Figure it out yourself.
And when you do, you will understand
much more about China.
l never thought of you as the kind
to pick up strays.
Not male ones, anyhow.
l can't just dump him out here, can l?
Well, he won't be up to much
for at least a month.
l can't get him back to Shanghai.
So, Miss Pearson,
tell me what in God's name l'm going to do
with a six-foot Oxford graduate
who can't speak a word of Chinese.
Jack! Have you ever heard of
a place called Huang Shi?
You know, l came back to China
to teach engineering.
Now l'm teaching peasants
how to blow things up.
To tell you the truth, it's much more fun.
Seriously?
Seriously.
l travel around to organize the resistance,
and try to stay ahead of the Japanese army.
-l have to leave tomorrow.
-Take me with you.
How fit do l need to be to use a typewriter,
for God's sake?
l'm not worried about you.
l'm worried about the poor bastards
who have to carry you around with them.
But there is a place up in the northwest.
lt's called Huang Shi.
lt's somewhere you can pick up
good background material
and work on your Chinese
while you are convalescing,
before you go on to the front.
-Very good.
-Did you understand it?
l certainly did.
You said, ''Let me introduce myself.
l am a pumpkin.''
This area is controlled by the Communists,
this by our Nationalist brothers-in-arms.
You will take the train as far as Baoji here,
and Huang Shi is right about here.
That's where you're going.
-Chen?
-Hey! Get down!
What's the matter?
They're not the Japanese.
No. They are not.
They're the government troops
of Chiang Kai-shek.
-Nationalists?
-Yeah.
-l thought you were brothers.
-Sometimes.
l thought you were fighting together
against the Japanese.
When it suits them or us.
This could be one of those times.
Or maybe not.
-What are they doing here?
-They are conscripts from the south.
They like to take them far from their homes,
so they are less likely to run away.
They're trapped.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello!
Who's in charge here?
This is for the person in charge.
l said this is for the person in charge.
Esteemed Headmaster...
l have the pleasure of introducing...
the great Oxford University scholar...
George...
Pig.
l am in charge, Mr. Pig.
-Hogg.
-lt says Pig.
How is it you speak English?
l'm not a peasant like these others.
l am Liu Shi Kai.
My father is a government official.
What's he want here?
-Food, maybe.
-What a joke.
You think l can cook with just a pot?
Come and see...
l have nothing... look.
All l have is this.
Grown-ups.
Teachers.
Where?
Gone... all gone.
Do you have any rice?
Get up.
Who's there?
The boys have taken the Englishman.
That's enough!
Touch him again...
l'm out of here forever.
She's bluffing.
You give me one good reason
why l should be bluffing, Shi Kai.
What's the matter with them?
They're like animals.
How long have you been in this country?
-Five weeks. And you?
-Five years.
-Here. Let me take a look at that.
-You're the nurse, aren't you? Lee.
-Lee Pearson.
-How do you do? l'm George.
l know who you are.
lt was my idea to send you here.
The great Oxford University scholar.
Jack Chen has given you
quite an introduction here.
Except he's called you Mr. Pig.
lt's not that funny.
He's a very nasty bit of work, that one.
l can't think why.
He only saw his father beheaded,
his mother raped and beheaded,
his sister raped and beheaded.
After that, they lined him up
on the edge of a pit to be machine-gunned.
He's a smart kid.
He waited until he felt
the guy next to him get hit.
Stop. Please.
-Nanjing. l was there.
-Jack told me.
That's why l thought you'd be good here.
You're going to need a Chinese name,
you know.
One they can actually say.
Hogg. Ho-Ke.
You're out of your mind
if you think l'm staying here.
l didn't come halfway round the world
to play nanny to a bunch of savages.
-Okay.
-So in the morning,
if you'd kindly point me
in the direction of the war and l'll be off.
l said okay.
Why do they give you such a wide berth?
Out here people die all the time,
typhus, cholera, tetanus.
Anyone gives me any trouble,
l just tell them,
''One day you graze yourself.
You'll think it's nothing.
''Next day you wake up with a fever.
You think it's a cold. That's all.
''Pretty soon your bones ache,
your jaw locks, your teeth clamp together
''and slowly, very, very slowly,
you die of tetanus.''
ln my bag l have vaccines
when l can get them.
lf l go, the bag goes with me,
so who's going to mess with me?
Why don't they just close this school
and send the boys home to their families?
This isn't a school.
-lt looks like a school.
-This is an orphanage.
Every one of them has a story,
just like Shi Kai's.
Now you want to find your war, Mr. Hogg?
Look around.
Because they don't need a teacher.
What they need is someone who can
make them care whether they live or die.
The beds are crawling with lice.
-The kids are, too.
-How adorable.
No joke. Body lice carry typhus.
Okay. Now for the boys.
What are you going to do? Boil them?
Jolly good!
Flea powder.
l haven't been able to get my hands
on any before.
But the thing is to figure out how to
make them understand it won't hurt.
l'm sure you'll manage.
Ho-Ke has lice on him.
Scratch.
The lice could make him sick.
This powder will kill the lice
but will do no harm to him.
Smile.
So Ho-Ke is very happy.
Now take off your clothes.
Oh, for Pete's sake,
it's nothing l haven't seen before.
Hands.
No lice.
We won't have to shave your head, too.
ls that a promise?
You're not vain, are you, Mr. Pig?
l hadn't thought so. Christ. What now?
-Coffee.
-Coffee?
-Here's to you, George.
-l haven't had real coffee since Shanghai.
-So, why China?
-Because it's in trouble.
Because everyone back home
is waiting for the shoe to drop,
waiting for the next war.
lt's like being stuck in a cellar
waiting for a storm to break.
l went to the States first.
Hitchhiked across the country twice.
But they're hunched down in their
bunkholes even deeper than we are.
''War? What war, mister?
We're in a depression here.''
And so then l went on to Japan,
learned some Japanese.
And they'll tell you
they don't want war either,
just ask them.
And then l went to Nanjing.
And l saw unspeakable things.
l begged Jack Chen to kill a man.
l never knew l had hate like that in me.
Everybody feels hate sometimes.
No. Not us.
You see, my family are pacifists.
And not just your quiet, normal,
private pacifists. Oh, no.
They're famous for it.
My mother had Gandhi to tea.
And my father went to jail
during the last war.
He's the bravest man l know.
And now l think they're wrong.
l think there are times one must fight.
Other people fight and die,
and there l am at my typewriter,
only l seem to have misplaced that now, too.
You saved lives today, George.
You sure didn't look like much of a hero,
and l bet you didn't feel like one.
But you know what? lt worked just fine.
Couldn't sleep?
Me neither.
One of the kids had the runs.
God-awful mess.
-You can keep the mule, by the way.
-You're leaving?
l've got a bunch of medical stations to run.
l only stopped off to bring you that grain.
My guess, it'll last you about three weeks.
After that,
you'll have to try to find them something.
-lt's up to you.
-But when will you be back?
-May.
-But this is March!
They're like kids anywhere, George.
They need to be warm, safe, clean and fed.
Now, if you can manage even one of those,
you'll be ahead of the game.
Now, you listen to me. l'm not staying here.
-You find someone else!
-There is no one else.
You have to stay, George.
Bugger.
lt keeps the wind out.
Rip it off.
You. Come and help me?
Yes, you.
Come.
Ho-Ke? Ho-Ke?
Hogg. My name is Hogg.
-Ching.
-Ching.
l'm writing a sort of letter.
l'll be with you in a minute.
Hey, stop that.
What's the matter?
Taba. Taba.
Taba.
Table. lt's a table.
Table. Table.
-Table, table, table, table!
-Okay. Okay.
Chair.
Chair.
Student.
Student.
Student.
That's you.
Teacher. l guess that means me.
Student. Teacher.
l'm looking for Merchant Wang.
Where would l find Merchant Wang?
Please excuse my poor house, Mr. Hogg.
lt has fallen on evil times.
The war?
War. Revolution. Also gambling.
Also opium.
So many ways to spend money
and to get nothing in return.
l take only solid currencies.
lf you can only pay in Chinese dollars,
then the price, l'm afraid,
will have to double.
l should like to pay in vegetables.
Vegetables are solid currency.
-English humor.
-You advance us the food and the seed,
we do all the work.
You take your share of the harvest.
Crops fail, Mr. Hogg.
What is this?
Durham wheat. Last year's harvest.
Red lentils. l shouldn't think
they'd do well in this climate.
We can do business.
Please come again, Mr. Hogg.
And send my regards to Miss Pearson.
Yes, of course.
l hope you're having fun, Yu-Lin.
Nothing will grow.
You're doing it wrong.
lt's good to be back.
l'm sure you'll be pleased.
Wei-Ping.
Say it in English. This is a dog.
Dog.
Dog.
Dog.
-Dog.
-Dog.
Dog.
-Dog.
-Dog.
Don't be afraid.
-Dog.
-Dog.
-Dog.
-Dog.
Dog.
Shi Kai! Don't!
Shi Kai.
You won't be able to save him, you know.
You might be able to limit
the damage he can do.
No more.
You never told me
what brought you here, Lee.
Freedom, l guess. And what happens?
l end up in a dark hovel
with centuries of soot falling on my head
doing an amputation by candlelight.
You're a surgeon, then?
When a man's dying of gangrene,
he tends not to check
the letters after your name.
When there's no one else,
you do what has to be done.
l'm not really a nurse, either. Just like you.
You're not really a teacher.
We're all something different in China.
That's why we came.
l was supposed to be
an army wife in Manila,
but l couldn't play bridge.
Funny how life works out.
What on earth?
lt's my one treasure.
-Do you dance, George?
-No.
Oh, come on. Sure you do.
lt's good to see you, Lee.
-Are you going to stay?
-l think so.
Awhile. And you?
l think so.
Yes.
Lo San.
He needs something to eat.
l don't cook for dirty little pigs.
Thank you.
You know nothing!
You stupid Gansu peasant.
Now, let's take a look at this.
Now let me see here...
That's horrible.
Brush your teeth every day.
You, too.
-Ching.
-You'll do just fine.
Just fine.
All her things
to the new room.
She'll be pleased.
Here.
We'll get some flowers.
<i>''Though I am old with wandering</i>
-''Through hollow lands and hilly lands,''
-Ho-Ke...
''l will find out where she has gone,
And kiss her lips and take her hands,
''And walk among the long dappled grass.''
Ching?
Hey, hey, hey...
lt's all right. You're safe.
Nobody's going to hurt you, Ching.
Goats?
Are you crazy?
They'll eat more than the milk they give.
They're for clearing ground.
My mother was a great gardener.
-She had goats.
-Don't you ever touch my things.
l'm sorry.
l thought you'd be more comfortable.
Well, you thought wrong.
Where are you going?
Okay then, when will you be back?
Don't be so ridiculous!
You can't just leave! Lee!
How's Uncle Jing today?
His tumor is worse, and he wants more pipe.
lt'll kill him now.
Maybe that won't be such a bad thing.
l heard today, the Nationalists have
found a solution to the opium problem.
-They're going to behead all the addicts.
-l heard the same thing.
Addicts and people who deal in opium.
The Japanese behead you
for being Chinese.
So, Miss Pearson, what can l do for you?
l was hoping
you might have some sulfa powder.
Nobody's got sulfa powder,
not even the Japanese.
lt will be sad for your friend.
Nobody to talk to but those boys.
-l think he will be lonely.
-l think he'll be just fine.
You say that because you are never lonely.
Well, you should go visit him,
if you think he's so lonely.
l don't have time for the problems
of people with no problems.
What do you have in the way of morphine?
-That's all you've got?
-No. But you're not my only customer.
Take opium instead.
You know what they say about opium.
You still feel the pain,
but it doesn't hurt anymore.
Six months ago,
they were filthy, starving, diseased
and of no value to anyone, and now...
l'm very impressed.
l have to confess, Mr. Hogg.
l did not think you could do it.
l have to confess, Mrs. Wang, neither did l.
l hope you will do me the honor
of accepting a small gift.
Good Lord, it's in English.
Where did you get it?
A missionary gave it to me
for being a very good girl.
<i>The Silk Road.</i>
lt was the link between the East and West
for more than 2,000 years.
-lt seemed appropriate.
-Thank you.
May it seal our friendship.
Yes.
-Where have you come from?
-Lingbao.
Lingbao?
We've walked for two days.
Don't worry, they often fly over.
-What's his name?
-Number Four.
Lao Si?
And they are... Let's see.
Number One.
Number Two.
Number Three.
Number Four!
Try to sleep.
Oh, Lao Si.
Ching?
He's too young.
Good night.
Not wounded!
Not wounded! Get him out of here!
Get him something to eat!
We've had 40, no, 50 guys in here today
who are nothing but piles of bones
held together by their uniforms.
They're dying of hunger,
not gunshots, Jack.
The Nationalists
are starving their own army.
-What's the point of our being here?
-None.
They are letting the Japs have Lingbao.
l've been ordered to evacuate.
Well, my wounded
won't survive being moved.
Take the ones that will.
Why are you taking off your uniform?
l thought l'd stick around a little longer,
prepare a little welcome for the Japs.
l'll make them as comfortable as l can.
You know that.
Be careful.
Jack!
Don't waste our morphine.
Leave him.
He's dying.
He's already dead.
-George.
-My God. Chen!
Chen!
Have you pissed yourself?
Oh, Jesus. He's wet the bed!
How is she?
Exhausted.
Lingbao.
lt was pretty bad. l was lucky.
She got out before the worst.
Will the Japanese get this far?
Maybe. Maybe not.
The trouble is,
l've seen what happens when they do.
Hello. Can we come in?
Who's this?
-Hello, Ching.
-Hello.
And this is Lao Si.
l saw a wolf, but l didn't cry.
Oh, my goodness.
Coffee?
-And steamed bread, with honey.
-Honey?
Come on, Lao Si.
He'll have that bread off you,
if you as much as blink.
His main objective in life
is greater rotundity.
-ls this all right with you?
-lt's fine.
Ching.
-Bye, bye.
-Bye, bye.
Lee.
Jack Chen is here.
He's been sick for the last week.
You're impossible, you know.
l thought you were dead as dirt.
lt's malaria. He's had it for years.
They all have it.
He'll be on his feet in no time.
They've put a price on your head, you know.
Oh, yeah? How much?
-Ten thousand yuan.
-l say, Jack.
That's about thirty bucks, US, George.
-That hurts my feelings.
-lt's a fortune around here.
<i>We'll fight the Japanese
with swords and guns</i>
<i>We'll fight the invader
with all our might</i>
-Six.
-Six.
-Seven.
-Seven.
We've got Nationalist visitors.
Stall them if you can.
Quietly, quietly.
The Japanese are advancing
and are very close.
lf our Nationalist forces
withdraw from Xi'an,
we'll get orders to take over
this entire estate for military use.
Then may l conclude
you have not got the order yet.
Well, gentlemen,
if that's all, you may leave now.
l have many things to do.
Oh, one more thing.
Those laborers...
We have no laborers here.
Only children.
-Children?
-This is a school for orphans.
ls this true?
Are they boys?
l'm not a Communist.
l'm only a teacher.
l just want to educate my boys.
Missionaries, Communists, the Japanese...
One foreign infection after another.
lt's been over 100 years.
Now it's finished.
You can no longer take our blood.
Our sons!
Your boys?
They are not your boys, Mr. Hogg.
Their blood belongs to China.
We're agreed?
You can't go back on your word.
Let him out.
Mr. Hogg. You are free.
How much did that cost?
Only slightly more
than what l think you are worth.
Thank you.
lf they decide to call me a Communist,
they'll close the school,
and they'll conscript the children.
Of course.
And l'm afraid
it will only be a matter of days.
Stay here.
Go. Just go!
-What was all that about?
-Bandits.
There's no one to control them nowadays.
They claim they have opium to sell,
but the packages are full of dirt.
Maybe it would be safer not to sell opium.
Safe? Nothing is safe.
You neither.
You have all those strong soldier boys.
You are like a farmer
with too many fat, juicy sheep!
So where do you propose we take them?
-Up the Silk Road.
-Through the mountains?
With snow and children, at 10,000 feet?
-That's insane.
-Actually, l mean to take them further,
beyond Lanzhou.
Have you ever heard of Shandan?
Shandan's on the edge of the Gobi Desert.
lt's about 700 miles from here.
Seven hundred miles.
Hogg, there's probably nothing there.
Exactly. There's nothing there.
Nothing anybody could possibly want.
Somewhere they'll be safe.
Chen will come with us
as far as the Yellow River.
Then he'll turn off
and join his Communist pals in Yen-an.
-What about you?
-What about me?
Will you go with Jack,
or will you stay with us
and head for Shandan?
ls that what you're asking me?
He's got fire in his belly, that one.
l would like to take him with me
when l rejoin my unit.
No.
-He's not a child.
-You're right. He's not.
He hasn't been a child for a very long time.
Yes. We were lovers once.
lt didn't work out, so...
Now we're friends.
That works.
l guess l just didn't want enough from him.
You fellows want so much to be needed.
Everybody wants that, even you.
Me, especially.
So what's it going to be?
Yen-an with him? Or Shandan with us?
lf l had any brains, l'd stay right here.
l believe in you.
l believe in each one of you.
You're the toughest people l've ever met.
Heavens, you once scared the life out of me.
lt's very hard to leave this place.
l know that.
But l want you to remember one thing.
You've done all this by yourselves.
You can do it all again.
You can do it anywhere.
Wound dressings.
Captured from the Japanese.
Each one of them
contains a single, sterile dressing,
wrapped around a tablet of morphine.
Handy, huh?
No wounded for us. That's an order.
No! No, l'll take that.
There's no point. We're leaving here soon.
As long as we have something to trade,
we'll survive.
Yes, l would say so.
But, still, this is an ambitious enterprise.
You are a remarkable man, Mr. Hogg.
l have greatly enjoyed
doing business with you.
This is your custom?
When we say goodbye to a great lady.
Well, goodbye, Mr. Hogg, and farewell.
Come on, boys!
Hang-Ger! Zuien-ze!
Xiao Bang! Mang Si!
Rou-Ding, Lao Tung?
Muriel?
Lao Da?
Lao San? Lao Er?
Lao Si?
Yu-Lin? Shi Kai?
Yu-Lin!
Yu-Lin!
Yu-Lin.
Yu-Lin? Yu-Lin.
lt's all right.
We'll make a new garden. l promise.
Yu-Lin?
Yu-Lin?
Ching...
l thought he was happy. l really did.
But we'll never know what went on
the last time he was happy.
Maybe someone, his mother
or father or sister or whoever, said,
''Ching, we have to leave here.''
And then something happened,
something so awful,
we can't even begin to imagine it.
lt doesn't go away.
lt never goes away, and l know that.
But all of this, flowers and honey, and...
l forgot.
l'm sorry, Ching. l forgot.
Be quiet.
Come on, boys. Come on!
Quiet, boys. That's it.
lf the wolf wakes you, don't be afraid.
-Just tell him what l said.
-l know.
Here, l'll take him.
Come on, sleepyhead.
Did you give that to him?
Let him keep it, George. lt's who he is.
There is an abandoned farmhouse
just the other side of the village.
We can camp there.
Also, he swears he saw
a couple of Japanese only two days ago.
Shi Kai, go and sleep now. l'll take over.
Shi Kai, did you hear me?
They're there. l can smell them.
Drop your guns!
Drop your guns!
Now!
Shi Kai!
Shi Kai! The door!
-We have to kill them, you know.
-No.
Don't be stupid, George. They are scouts.
lf they get away, they will rejoin their unit.
-l'll do it.
-l said no!
Where's Shi Kai?
Have you seen Shi Kai?
Where?
Shi Kai!
When we reach the Silk Road,
l want you to leave us.
Come on, boys! Keep moving!
That's it.
Keep up ahead.
Why did you stop?
lt's a Japanese patrol.
lt's okay.
We're refugees.
We're taking them North to safety.
Your papers?
We have no papers.
Search their belongings.
My God.
Sir, look at this!
A Corporal Kurahara.
No!
No! No!
We found it.
We found it on a dead soldier.
He shouldn't have taken it.
He's just a child.
Where did you find it?
Shi Kai!
Shi Kai!
Put the gun down now!
Quiet!
Shi Kai!
Shi Kai! The wagon!
Shi Kai!
We're moving on.
Shi Kai!
Lee, l thought you said
there was morphine in these.
Lee!
Lee! Where are you?
-l'm here.
-Hurry up!
-lt's all that's left.
-What?
He's sleeping?
He won't wake up now.
Sometime in the next hour or two, he'll die.
Sleep, Shi Kai.
Everything's all right now.
Go find them. Okay? Go find your family.
Sleep, sleep...
lt's okay. Easy, easy.
You and l
have one thing in common, George,
we are both from good families.
We have the luxury of our ideals.
Lee, she is the one who's different.
lt's never a matter of ideals to her,
but something deep in her gut.
She can't look at these people
without feeling their pain.
When it got too much,
she took opium to deal with her pain.
Have you ever heard of ''the Bitter Sea''?
lt's an old name for China.
What we Chinese do best, is to endure.
We try to keep our heads above water.
That's all.
While the Bitter Sea swirls around us,
we endure.
But, you know,
Lee's more Chinese than either of us.
She doesn't believe in the future,
because like the Chinese,
she doesn't think she deserves one.
George, you're going to show her she does.
You're still in love with her.
Not me. l'm otherwise engaged.
You thought l was such a goddamn saint,
didn't you, George?
Well, now you know.
Now you know.
Well, you're certainly no lady.
You're a brave, beautiful woman.
You're the bravest, most beautiful woman
l've ever met.
Tell her goodbye for me.
Come on, Lao Si.
That's the Yellow River.
And just this side of it, Lanzhou.
Stop!
l am the Magistrate of Lanzhou.
This is Mr. Chang Shengyi,
the Chief of Police.
You took more than 60 children,
climbed over Liupan Mountain
and walked 500 miles.
lt's hard to believe.
But it's true.
How long did it take?
Three months!
-You'll walk 200 miles more to Shandan?
-Correct.
l won't allow you to walk to Shandan.
lt's out of the question.
l have four Dodge trucks.
You can borrow them.
Hogg, do you see that?
Hogg?
Hogg!
ls everybody all right?
-Hogg? Are you okay?
-Just a scratch.
All right.
My God, where have you brought us?
The 14th century?
Look!
There it is, beyond the watchtower.
Shandan.
Thanks.
l was told to find a building for you.
This is called
The Temple of King Ashoka's Hair.
The monks left
many years ago.
Do you think it will do?
Come on, boys. Time for bed.
-Good night, boys.
-Good night.
-Good night.
-Good night.
Hey. Quick.
What are you doing in here, pumpkin?
You're getting so heavy!
Coffee.
-Where on earth did you find this?
-Surprise.
l thought l'd lost it.
Untouched the whole way.
Celebration.
Are you all right?
Flu, l think. Tired.
Here. Drink this and l'll take a look at you.
Actually, l...
Hogg!
Hogg?
Rou-Ding.
They'll have this in Lanzhou. Okay?
We've run out of this.
l know, Ho-Ke has tetanus.
Okay, hurry! Please, hurry! Please! Hurry!
-Hey.
-Lee?
-Lee?
-Yeah?
-l'm not scared.
-No, of course not.
Rou-Ding's coming with serum.
You're going to be fine.
No. But it's all right.
l don't like to be contradicted, Hogg.
You know that.
l've been so lucky, Lee.
l've been so lucky.
Hold him tight. That's good.
lt's okay, it's going to be okay.
SHl-KAl
Ching.
CHlNG
He came from a distant land
but his spirit wished to stay here with us.
Ho-Ke has not left us,
because he gave himself to each of us,
and whatever we do from now on,
we will always be able
to hear his voice.
Jack.
Jack.
l only found out a week ago.
Somebody came from Lanzhou.
-l'm fine, Jack.
-We need you.
The boys are safe now.
They can manage on their own.
Lee. l'm serious.
Maybe these boys don't need me, Jack,
but l need them.
Oh, yes, l do need them.
l didn't pee the bed
because l'm a big boy now.
lf the wolf comes,
l'll say, ''Go away, stupid,''
and he'll be frightened and run away.
Ho-Ke says you can have that.
l don't like coffee.
Ho-Ke says you can have it.
You're a brave boy, Lao Si.
Brave boy.
<i>The four of us
would never have survived without Hogg.</i>
<i>That's certain.</i>
<i>We brothers didn't know our birthdays.</i>
<i>Even my older brother didn't know.</i>
<i>When asked, we all say the 22nd.</i>
<i>This was the day George Hogg died.</i>
<i>Hogg gave a speech.</i>
<i>He wrote three words
on the blackboard, in English.</i>
<i>Where do we want to go,</i>
<i>why and how.</i>
<i>He had his methods.</i>
<i>Then he explained how far it was
to Shandan, over 1,000 kilometers.</i>
<i>We would march there,</i>
<i>our belongings packed
on handcarts and mule carriages.</i>
<i>We kept hearing that Shandan was so cold,</i>
<i>that your nose would break off
if you touched it.</i>
<i>And when you pee,
it would become an ice stick,</i>
<i>but Hogg assured us
it wouldn't be that bad.</i>
<i>It was a very cold winter.</i>
<i>And walking all the way
through snow and on icy roads,</i>
<i>it took us over two months.</i>
<i>Later, people called this
The Long March in Miniature.</i>
<i>He was a perfect man.</i>
<i>Everybody has his flaws,
but I couldn't find any in Hogg.</i>
<i>He was always smiling when talking to us.</i>
<i>He knew, and he taught us
what to hate and what to love.</i>
<i>The Chinese people
remember those foreigners</i>
<i>who helped China during those struggles.</i>
<i>No matter how the world may change,</i>
<i>we, the Chinese, will never forget them.</i>
