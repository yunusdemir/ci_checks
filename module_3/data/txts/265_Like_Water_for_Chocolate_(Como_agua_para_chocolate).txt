LIKEWATER FOR CHOCOLATE
" The onion must be
chopped finely.
I suggest...
that you put a piece of onion
on your head...
to avoid the annoying crying...
that is caused
by chopping it."
The trouble with crying
while chopping onions...
isn't the crying.
It's that sometimes
you can't stop.
Mother always said...
that I'm as sensitive to onions
as my great-aunt Tita was.
She even cried
inside her mother's womb...
whenever my great-grandmother
chopped onions.
Senor Juan!
Go get the midwife!
There's not enough time.
What's happening?
The baby's coming.
Oh! Too late!
Nacha, the maid,
said that Tita...
was literally pushed
into this world...
by a torrid stream of tears...
that overflowed from the table
to the kitchen floor.
Another girl,Juan.
When the scare was over...
and the water had evaporated,
thanks to the sun...
Nacha swept up
what remained of the tears.
With that salt,
she filled a 40-pound sack...
which they used for cooking
for a long time.
Well, it's not entirely
his fault.
Why do you say that?
They say that
your second child, Gertrudis...
isn't your daughter
but the daughter of the mulatto.
Our condolences, Madame.
Poor little innocent child.
You've been left...
fatherless and without milk
from one day to the next.
But don't you worry.
My teas will make you strong...
and pretty.
The first man who sees you
will want to marry you.
You'll see.
Don't ever say that again,
Nacha.
Tita will never marry.
Being my youngest daughter...
she's destined to care for me
until I die.
Feed the girls.
They're hungry.
Whatever you say,
Madame Elena.
Fed by Nacha,
Tita grew up in the kitchen...
amidst the smells
of chicken soup...
thyme, laurel,
steamed milk...
garlic and, of course, onion.
Some more hot chocolate, Senor?
Thank you, no.
Good evening, Don Pascual.
Sit down, please.
When Tita felt Pedro's burning
gaze on her bare shoulders...
she understood exactly
how raw dough must feel...
when it comes in contact
with boiling oil.
The heat that invaded her
was so real...
that she feared that,
just like dough...
bubbles would break out
all over her body...
on her stomach,
her heart, her breasts.
She lowered her eyes
and tried to escape.
Miss Tita, I'd like to take
this opportunity to say...
that I am
deeply in love with you.
I know
this declaration of love...
may seem hasty and out of place,
but getting anywhere near you...
is so difficult that I decided
to tell you tonight.
I only beg you to tell me
if I may hope for your love.
I don't know what to say.
Give me time to think.
No, I can't.
I need an answer right now.
One doesn't think about love.
Either one feels it
or one doesn't.
I'm a man
of few, but firm, words.
I swear you'll have
my love forever.
What about you? Do you feel
the same way about me?
Yes.
Mommy?
Yes?
Pedro Muzquiz
wants to talk to you.
To talk about what?
I don't know.
Tell him if it's to ask for
your hand, he needn't bother.
He'd be wasting his time
and mine too.
You know that
as my youngest daughter...
you must look after me
until the day I die.
That'll be all for today.
But I think that--
You don't think.
And that's that!
Never, for generations...
has anyone in our family
ever questioned this tradition.
My daughter won't be the first!
Chencha, see who's there.
Yes, Dona Elena.
You didn't invite anyone
for your birthday...
without telling me?
No, Mommy.
It's Don Pascual Muzquiz...
and his son, Pedro.
They want to talk to you.
For the reasons
I've just explained...
Tita will definitely
not be able to.
Of course...
if you want Pedro
to get married...
let me suggest
my daughter Rosaura.
She's only two years older
than Tita.
She is amply prepared
and ready for marriage.
Oh! Please forgive me!
Oh, girls! Girls!
Oh, really! How can
your mommy be so cruel?
You can't just exchange tacos
for enchiladas!
What did she say?
Come and greet Don Pascual
and Pedro...
and we'll toast
your sister's wedding.
You'll let Tita marry Pedro?
No. Pedro will marry Rosaura.
Why did you do that?
We looked ridiculous...
by accepting your marriage
to Rosaura.
Where's the love
you swore to Tita?
- Don't you keep your word?
- Sure I do.
But if you definitely couldn't
marry the woman you love...
and the only way to be near her
was to marry her sister...
wouldn't you make
the same decision as I did?
Eat, my child.
Food will make it hurt less.
Thank you, Nacha,
but I'm just not hungry now.
Just take one bite
of the Christmas roll...
and I'll tell you
what I heard.
Don Pascual asked Pedro...
why he agreed
to marry without love...
and young Pedro
told his father...
that he is marrying
for love...
a great big love for you.
I can't eat.
Thank you, Nacha.
I want to be alone.
That night Tita found it
impossible to sleep.
She couldn't understand
what she was feeling.
It's too bad that...
black holes
hadn't been discovered yet.
Because then
she'd have understood that...
a black hole
had landed in her chest...
and allowed the infinitely
cold air to rush in.
That night she cried
and knitted...
knitted and cried
until dawn...
until she finished the quilt
and it covered her.
But it didn't help.
Neither that night,
nor many other nights...
could she conquer the cold.
What are you doing here?
I'm helping Nacha.
You should have been
at your sister's engagement.
I had a headache.
You will not disobey me...
nor ruin your sister's wedding
by playing the martyr.
And since you're so interested
in helping Nacha...
you'll be responsible
for the wedding banquet.
And no sour face.
And not a single tear.
You hear me?
Yes, Mommy.
Dona Elena,
I'll prepare the carriage...
to deliver these invitations.
Fine.
I'm sorry, Pedro.
Did I hurt you?
Not as much as I hurt you.
Let me explain my intentions.
I haven't asked
for explanations.
At least allow me
a few words.
I did once, and it was all lies.
I won't listen to you anymore.
167...
Only three more.
Isn't the cake ready?
No...
but everything else is.
Hurry up.
It's midnight. You should rest
a little before the ceremony.
I'm going to bed.
Good night.
Good night.
See you...
tomorrow, God willing.
Now...
you can let your tears flow,
my child.
Because tomorrow
nobody must see you cry.
Especially not Rosaura.
I'll finish up.
You go on.
No, I'll help you.
We're almost done.
Go to sleep, girl.
I can manage.
Only the pots know the boiling
points of their broths.
But I can guess yours.
And stop crying
into the batter...
or you'll ruin it.
Go.
Poor Tita, watching her sister
marry her boyfriend!
One day I happened to see,
during Mass...
Pedro slipped Tita a love note.
It was even perfumed!
I saw them holding hands
in the town square.
How happy they looked!
They'll all live
in the same house!
If I were Elena,
I wouldn't allow it.
Don't I get
a congratulatory hug?
Yes, of course.
I hope you'll be very happy.
I'm sure I will be, now that
I've got what I wanted:
to be near you...
the woman I truly love.
What did Pedro tell you?
Nothing, Mommy.
Don't try to fool me.
I've done everything
you're thinking of doing.
So don't play innocent with me.
And don't let me see you
near Pedro again!
This is delicious.
Some more, please.
Congratulations, children.
Cheers, Pedro!
A toast!
Cheers!
Yes, thank you.
Thank you.
Weeping was the first symptom
of a strange intoxication.
Asense of melancholy
and frustration...
overtook all the guests, making
them take refuge on the patio...
in the barns and bathrooms...
as they yearned for
' the love of their lives. '
Nobody escaped the magic spell.
Several lucky ones
reached the bathrooms in time.
The rest took part in
the collective vomiting spree...
that took place...
by the river.
Mommy, Nacha--
What emetic did you put
in that cake?
- Emetic?
- You and Nacha will regret...
ruining your sister's wedding!
Nacha is dead!
I think it's best
to wait a while...
until the intoxication
wears off, don't you?
- Pedro.
- Yes?
It's been three months
since the wedding.
I'm feeling perfectly fine now.
Yes.
Lord, it's not vice, nor lust,
but to produce...
a son to serve You.
Our Father Who art in Heaven...
Tita, I told Mother
I want to cook today.
You've never cooked before.
Should I help you?
No, I want to do it myself.
It's Rosaura's first cooking
effort. I think it's not bad.
What do you think, Pedro?
For the first time
it's not that bad.
Hurry, Chencha.
I need the bathroom again.
Who told Rosaura
she can cook?
She gave us all the runs.
Don't do that, girl.
They're like the devil himself.
They say one look from them
and you're pregnant!
Tita, today is
your first anniversary...
as the ranch's head cook.
So I took the liberty
of bringing you these roses.
Throw them out!
Don't throwthem out, my child.
You can use them
to make quails...
in rose petal sauce.
This is the nectar of the gods!
It's much too salty.
Excuse me.
I don't feel well.
Astrange alchemical phenomenon
seemed to have occurred.
Not only Tita's blood...
but her whole being had...
dissolved into the rose sauce...
into the quails...
and into every aroma
of the meal.
That's how she invaded
Pedro's body...
voluptuously, ardently fragrant
and utterly sensual.
They had discovered...
a new way of communicating.
Tita was the sender...
and Pedro the recipient.
Gertrudis was the lucky one
within whom...
this sexual encounter was
synthesized through the meal.
The rose smell...
that Gertrudis emitted
traveled ever so far.
This fragrance caused
the Villista chief...
to seek out something
unknown...
at an unspecified place.
It was difficult to realize...
that horse and rider...
seemed to be obeying
superior orders.
Tita, what's happening out here?
The Federales came
and set the bathroom on fire.
Where is Gertrudis?
They kidnapped her.
Mama Elena believed the whole
story and became quite ill.
But she almost died
when Father Ignacio told her...
that he had heard...
that Gertrudis worked
in a brothel near the border.
...not a holy house.
She forbade any mention
of her daughter's name...
and had her photos
and birth certificate burned.
' Quail in rose petal sauce'
Today we ate this dish...
and Gertrudis ran away.
My Gertrudis!
Tita!
Where the devil are you?
Your sister's there?
Yes, and it's
none of your business.
Give it to her
and come right back!
I don't want my mother
to find out.
Where were you?
In the bathroom, Mommy.
You're in charge
of the ranch today.
Chencha is coming with me
to Eagle Pass...
to shop for your sister's baby.
Very well.
Tita, the baby is coming.
I'll go get Doctor Brown.
Please watch over Rosaura
until I'm back.
Hurry back.
I have lots of work.
Nacha, help me, please!
I'm really amazed
at the way Tita handled it.
Rosaura was near death.
Speaking of my daughter,
Doctor...
shouldn't you come visit her
every day?
Yes, I think that would be best,
given her delicate condition.
Preparing the 'mole. '
Tita knew...
how contact with fire...
alters elements.
How dough
becomes a tortilla.
And that a breast
untouched by love's fire...
just isn't a breast...
but a useless
ball of dough.
In one instant Pedro had
transformed Tita's breasts...
from chaste to voluptuous...
without even touching them.
Miss Tita,
a stray bullet...
hit Roberto's wet nurse
on the head...
when she was coming here.
She's dead.
Tita never could resist helping
anyone who cried out for food.
She immediately felt the need
to relieve that hunger.
That feeling enabled her virgin
breast to nurse her nephew.
Tita, what happened
with the baby?
Did he eat?
Yes, Mom. He drank his tea
and fell asleep.
Thank God!
Pedro, what are you waiting for?
Take the baby to your wife.
Children should be
with their mothers.
The boy looks wonderful
next to such a beautiful aunt.
Thank you, Doctor.
He's not even your child.
I'm picturing
how lovely you'll look...
when you carry your own child.
Forgive me.
Did I say something wrong?
No, it's just that...
I can't marry or have children
because I must...
care for my mother
until she dies.
What? That's ridiculous!
But that's how it is.
Excuse me.
I must attend to the guests.
Tita, the 'mole' is superb!
Do give me the recipe.
Of course. The secret is
that when you cook it...
you do it with much love.
She thinks I'm dumb.
I worry that someday...
Rosaura might need a doctor
and we'll be unable to get one.
I think, once she regains
her strength, she should...
move with her husband and child
to San Antonio, Texas...
with my cousin.
There she'll get
the best medical attention.
I don't agree, Dona Elena.
During this
political situation...
you need a man at home
to protect you.
I've never needed one.
I've managed the ranch
and my daughters by myself.
Besides, men are not that
important for living, Father.
Nor is the revolution
as dangerous as they claim.
It's worse to have chilies
without any water around.
Dona Elena! Always so witty!
- Pedro?
- Yes.
You'd better stay away
while I feed the baby.
Mother suspects and
she'll have you move away.
Let's not give her more cause.
Please, go.
I could never cut watermelon
like your mama.
Don't worry. Nobody besides her
can do it.
When it comes to
breaking things up...
your mama's the master.
Really!
Stop babbling. Come, let's bring
her the ice before she yells.
Where's the ice?
Tita! Where were you?
In the bathroom, Mommy.
Tita!
The water's too hot!
You haven't learned anything
in all these years!
Give it to me!
The towel! You want me
to wrinkle up in here?
Where's the slip?
I burned it, Mommy.
What are you thinking of,
you stupid little girl?
Save the tears for when I die.
Hand me the dirty one
or I'll catch cold.
You opened the door too wide.
Do you want me to die
of pneumonia?
You're pulling my hair!
Leave me alone! Go the kitchen
and finish the chorizo.
Why are you crying?
I hate to see you cry.
What's wrong?
Nicolas came back
from San Antonio...
and said he passed away.
What?
Who died?
The boy!
What boy?
Your grandson.
Everything he ate
made him sick.
So he died.
Sit and keep working!
I don't want tears.
Poor child.
I hope God has him in Heaven.
We can't let our sorrow
take over.
There's a lot of work.
First finish this.
Then do whatever you want.
But no crying.
You hear me?
That's what I think
of your orders!
I'm tired of always obeying you!
Roberto's death is your fault!
Have Nicolas remove the ladder
from the dovecote...
and keep it away
until tomorrow.
Tita, my child.
Chencha!
What's wrong?
Why isn't Tita coming down?
She doesn't want to.
She's like crazy.
Fine. Then let her go
to the crazy house.
There's no room in my house
for lunatics!
I bought you this yarn.
I noticed you like to knit.
Is the color all right,
or should I exchange it?
You didn't like the food, right?
I don't blame you.
Our housekeeper, Sue Ellen,
is an awful cook...
but my poor son and I
put up with it.
Of course, you don't have to.
I'll tell Sue Ellen that
you're not feeling well.
So don't worry.
Tita, whose hands were now
free of her mother's orders...
didn't know
what to ask of them.
They could do anything
or change into anything.
If they could just
turn into birds and fly away!
She'd like them
to take her far, far away.
To fly away from herself.
She didn't want to think
or make decisions.
Above all, she never wanted
to speak again.
She didn't want her words
to scream out her pain.
In 1669, Brandt...
a chemist from Hamburg...
while searching for
the 'philosopher's stone'...
discovered...
phosphorus.
My grandmother, Morning Star--
she was a Kikapu Indian--
she used to say...
that we're all born
with a box of matches inside.
We can't light them
by ourselves.
Just like in this experiment...
we need oxygen
and the help of a candle.
Except that in our case...
the oxygen has to come,
for example...
from a lover's breath.
The candle can be anything:
a melody, a word...
a caress...
a sound.
Anything that
pulls the trigger...
and sets off
one of the matches.
Every person has to discover...
what will pull his trigger
to enable him to live.
Because it is the explosive
flare of a match...
that feeds our souls.
If there's nothing
to trigger the explosion...
our box of matches
becomes damp...
and then we'll never be able
to light any of them.
There are many ways
to dry a damp match box.
You can rest assured
there is a cure.
Of course, it's important to
light the matches one at a time.
Because if an intense
burst of emotion...
were to ignite them
all at once...
they would produce
such a strong brilliance...
that before our eyes
there would appear a tunnel...
of such radiance...
showing us the path
we forgot at birth...
the same path
that calls us back...
to our divine origins.
" Broths can cure
any type of illness...
be it physical or mental."
At least, that was
Chencha's opinion, and Tita's...
although lately she hadn't
believed it strongly enough.
Now she had to accept it
as true.
She herself had recovered
after just one bowl...
of this magic beef broth.
John, please don't go!
Oh, child!
And I imagined you
tied up with some crazies.
Why not, considering
the mother that God gave you!
I'm almost going crazy.
She has nobody left
to order about, so I get it all!
And she lectures me.
She says disobedient women
who leave home...
" end up wallowing
in the filthy river of sin."
I think she meant Gertrudis.
Thank you for coming.
It's been so good to see you.
I have a favor to ask.
Tell my mother
that you saw me...
that I'm fine...
and that I'll never
go back to the ranch.
Can you guess
what I'm thinking?
Will you marry me?
Yes.
I will.
Chencha.
Come, look at this.
No! Let me go!
Mama Elena!
Let me go!
Doctor, something very serious
has happened at the ranch.
I'll take care of it.
Let's go.
Come out of there, you devil!
You've no right
to steal my belongings.
When she realized
her mother's secret...
Tita cried.
Not for the woman
who had repressed her...
but for someone
who'd been frustrated by love...
like herself.
It's a girl.
Is she O.K.?
Yes, considering
how premature she was.
But, unfortunately,
she'll need a lot of care.
And Rosaura?
The birth was
very complicated, Pedro.
I had to operate...
and she won't be able
to bear any more children.
I'm sorry.
Is she all right?
Her condition is delicate.
She won't be able
to tend to the child.
We're thinking of
naming her after you.
It's strange that, like you,
she was born out of grief...
and will have to live
in the kitchen and drink teas.
And since she'll be
my only daughter--
I don't like the idea.
Give her a different name.
How about Esperanza?
I don't know.
Tita, why does she cry
when she's with me?
She doesn't seem to love me.
That's not it.
She misses the warmth
and smell of the kitchen.
But I want her to be with me.
To keep the child
near Rosaura...
the child had to feel
she was...
in the kitchen
with her Aunt Tita.
Tita was so angry...
with Rosaura's plans
for Esperanza...
that she wished her sister
had never...
allowed those disgusting,
repulsive and revolting words...
to escape from her mouth.
Tita wished
she'd swallowed them...
and kept them inside until
the rot and worms ate them up.
Thank you, love.
You're welcome.
As you already know,
the purpose of this visit...
is to ask for Tita's hand.
When will you
be getting married?
As soon as possible.
I don't see
any problem with that.
You have our blessing.
Let's set the wedding date.
Well, I think
this is the time...
when I'm supposed
to give you this.
To the happy couple!
Take care of yourself.
I won't be gone long.
I promise.
I'm almost done.
Stop!
" That will be all for today"!
See you tomorrow.
See you tomorrow.
And thanks for everything.
Pedro.
What are you doing here?
Tita! Come here.
- Tita isn't here.
- Come! Look!
Holy Mother of God in Heaven...
take Dona Elena's soul so she'll
stop walking in the shadows...
of purgatory.
What do you mean, Chencha?
Can't you see it's the ghost
of the dead woman?
She's paying for something!
I'll never go near
that place again!
Me neither.
Oil of cocoa is an excellent
lip moisturizer.
Every winter Tita's lips
were so chapped...
that if she wanted to smile...
she had to use
plenty of ointment.
But today it had nothing to do
with smiling.
The possibility
of finding herself pregnant...
is no laughing matter.
Tita.
I didn't hear you come in.
I noticed.
You're lost in thought.
It's just that
I miss Gertrudis.
I bet she'd like
to be with us tonight...
cutting this bread.
Ah, Tita, I need your advice.
About what?
Well, first let me say...
I've been wanting
to talk to you...
but jealousy kept me
from doing it.
Now it's different.
If you still loved Pedro,
you wouldn't be marrying John.
So, well...
you must help me
win back Pedro.
Me?
Only you can do it.
Look, I think-- Well,
it's my weight, my flatulence...
and my bad breath
that keep him away from me.
What can I do?
Put me on a special diet,
because this fat--
Well, Pedro
won't even touch me.
Don't cry.
I'll give you a special diet.
You'll get so pretty.
What about the gas
and the bad breath?
Mint leaves for the breath.
They can freshen
the worst breath.
I'll take you off
those foods that cause gas.
Don't cry now,
or you'll have me crying too.
You're such a good sister!
I'm so happy
we're together again.
I'll get some mint leaves.
Tita...
I told you many times
not to go near Pedro.
Then, why?
I tried, Mommy, but--
No 'buts'!
There's no name
for what you've done!
You forgot about morals...
respect
and the rules of society!
You're worthless.
You don't even
respect yourself.
You've dragged my family name
through the mud...
from my ancestors
down to that...
cursed child
in your womb!
My child is not cursed!
Yes, it is!
I'm cursing it!
It and you,
cursed forever!
No, please!
Close that door.
Can't you see
how cold it is?
You're so strange lately.
What's wrong?
Rosaura, what a pleasure!
Those Lobo people are here.
The others
want to cut the bread.
We're coming.
Pedro, can you help me?
We'll talk later.
Hello. What's happening?
Nothing.
Good evening, Father.
Good evening, Dona Paquita.
What a surprise!
How are you doing?
Delicious.
The dog?
What's wrong?
The girl is about to faint!
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
The dog is so old,
he barks at anything.
The devil's dog.
It scared us.
Are you feeling better?
You seem dizzy,
and your eyes look strange.
If I didn't know
you're a good girl...
I'd say you were pregnant.
Pregnant?
Only you would suspect that.
And what do my eyes
have to do with it?
Just by seeing a woman's eyes,
I can immediately tell...
whether she's pregnant.
Gertrudis!
I came to cut the bread
and have some hot chocolate.
Welcome!
Sergeant Trevino, take the men
around back to be looked after.
Yes, General!
Tita, meet my husband.
Juan Alejandrez,
at your service.
Pleased to meet you.
Please, come in.
I don't know where she got
her sense of rhythm.
Mama didn't like to dance...
and Dad was a bad dancer.
You don't know how much
I missed this food...
especially
my cream fritters.
Revolutions
wouldn't be so bad...
if you could eat at home
every day with your family.
When Juan and I
found each other again...
he said he'd come here
looking for me.
I got so nostalgic
for your food.
So, how soon
will my fritters be ready?
I'm boring you, aren't I?
Of course not, Gertrudis.
Why do you say that?
It's your eyes.
Your mind has been off somewhere
for a while.
It's Pedro, right?
Yes.
If you still love him,
why marry John?
I'm not marrying him.
I can't do it, Gertrudis.
I'll move this off the stove
and you can keep crying.
Why can't you get married?
Because I think I'm pregnant.
Pedro's the father, of course?
- Yes.
- Rosaura knows?
Nobody knows.
Not even Pedro.
I don't know what'll happen
when Rosaura learns the truth.
The truth!
Listen, Tita, the real truth is
that there is no truth.
It all depends.
In your case the truth could be
that Rosaura married Pedro...
without giving a damn
that you two loved each other.
Yes, but she's the wife.
I'm not.
So what?
Did that wedding change
how you and Pedro felt?
No.
Of course not!
Your love is one of
the truest loves I know.
And you both should admit
that truth to Rosaura...
and anyone else.
Especially since Mother's dead.
You think I should
talk to Rosaura?
While I tell you what to do...
would you fix the syrup
for my fritters?
It might be good if Pedro knew
you're carrying his child.
Pedro, it's lucky you came by!
My sister has something
to tell you.
Go and talk outside
while I finish the syrup.
Sergeant Trevino!
At your service.
Can you cook
cream fritters?
To be quite honest...
no, but if you wish,
I'll try.
Yes, I wish.
And remember,
you've never let me down.
I hope this won't be
the first time.
Why didn't you tell me?
Because first I wanted
to make a decision.
- Have you?
- No.
Before you make a decision,
you should know...
that having a child with you...
is the greatest joy
I could hope for.
And to enjoy it properly...
we should go far,
far away from here.
But we can't
just think of ourselves.
There are also Rosaura
and Esperanza.
What will happen to them?
Little star
Of a distant
Sky
That sees my pain
That knows my suffering
Come down and tell me
If you love me a lot
Or just a little
See what you've caused?
Pedro and you have no shame.
If you don't want
blood in this house...
go where you can't
hurt anyone...
before it's too late.
You're the one
who should leave.
I'm tired of your tormenting me.
Leave me alone
once and for all.
Not until you behave
like a proper woman.
Until you're decent!
What do you mean 'decent'?
How you behaved?
Yes.
Well, that's how I'm behaving.
Didn't you have
an illegitimate daughter?
You'll be damned
for talking this way.
No more damned than you.
Shut your mouth!
Who do you think you are?
I believe in what I am.
A person who has the right
to live as she pleases.
Leave me alone!
I can't stand you.
What's more, I hate you.
I always hated you.
With these magic words...
Tita drove her mother's ghost
away forever...
and freed herself from
her psychological pregnancy.
But she couldn't keep Mama Elena
from getting even with Pedro.
Tita, don't go!
Don't leave me.
No, Pedro, I won't.
Cover him with
'tepezcohuite' bark.
I'll miss you, Gertrudis.
I'll miss you too. I'd like to
stay and help you with Pedro.
But I've been ordered
on to Torreon.
- Be careful.
- You too.
Women soldiers
avoid pregnancy...
by washing
with vinegar and water.
Watch it from now on.
That's enough.
Now it's my turn.
Thank you.
Tell Pedro once he's well,
after the revolution...
we'll do more duets.
Let's go. It's getting late.
Sergeant Trevino.
Yes, my General.
Let's go!
I'll finally get a rest!
Pedro, congratulations!
You've recovered
amazingly well.
You won't be my patient
much longer.
That's good. Thank you.
It's lucky
you got here in time.
I wouldn't have known how
to use the 'tepezcohuite.'
Don't thank me.
Thank my grandmother.
Her experiments with this bark
will be famous someday.
Besides, with such
a loving nurse as you...
who wouldn't get well fast?
That's true.
I'll fix you a drink
in the living room.
No, thank you.
I won't keep you from
preparing tonight's dinner.
You didn't tell me
the doctor's coming tonight.
It's just that my aunt,
who came for the wedding...
is anxious to meet Tita.
We were just waiting
for you to get better...
before arranging a visit.
Now I understand...
why Tita
nursed me so carefully.
Exactly!
You finally figured it out!
Come,John.
I think Pedro wants to rest.
See you tomorrow, Pedro.
You should have sent Chencha
with my food.
You shouldn't be late
for your dinner.
When will you tell him...
you can't marry him because
you're carrying my child?
I can't tell him that.
Afraid of hurting
little Doc's feelings?
It's not that. It would be
unfair to treat him like that.
He deserves my utmost respect.
If you don't, I will.
No, you won't say anything.
First, because
I won't allow it...
and second,
because I'm not pregnant.
What?
I thought I was pregnant,
but I was just late.
Now it's normal.
So that's it.
Without being tied to me...
you're torn between staying
with a sick man...
or marrying John, right?
You're no longer sick.
Even more reason
for leaving me.
My loving you more than anybody
doesn't matter to you.
Neither do all the sacrifices
I've made for you.
For me? Like what?
Marrying your sister just to be
near you meant nothing?
I wish you had just
kidnapped me.
We need to talk.
It's long overdue.
Yes, it's been due since the day
you married my boyfriend.
Let's start there. You should
never have had a boyfriend.
According to Mother or you?
According to
the family tradition you broke.
And I'll continue to break it.
I had the same right
to marriage as you.
You had no right
to come between two people...
who loved each other deeply.
Not that deeply.
He simply replaced you with me.
I married Pedro
because that's what he wanted.
For your information...
he married you to be near me,
but he didn't love you.
Never mind the past.
Pedro married me. Period.
I won't have you two
making a fool of me.
No one's making a fool of you.
Oh, really!
And when everyone
on the ranch sees you...
crying on Pedro's shoulder,
holding hands?
I'm the laughingstock!
Look! I don't care
if you and Pedro go to hell...
for smooching
in every dark corner!
It's good he does it with you...
because he'll never
touch me again!
I will continue
to be the wife.
And you'd better not let anyone
ever see you together again.
Starting today, I'll care
for my daughter. You stay away!
You'd set a bad example
and give her bad advice.
You can be sure that
I won't let you ruin her life...
with this stupid
family tradition.
From a distance
you can't do much.
Did you ever see prostitutes...
allowed near children
of decent families?
You really think
our family is decent?
My little family is.
And to keep it decent, you'll
stay away from my daughter.
Or I'll evict you
from the house Mother left me.
Don't worry, my sweet.
The tradition will die with me.
Nobody'll hurt you.
Is something wrong?
Yes.
I can't tell you now.
Your aunt will feel left out
if we speak Spanish.
Don't worry.
She's completely deaf.
How can she
carry on conversations?
Because she reads lips.
But only in English.
So feel free to talk,
because, in addition...
while she's eating,
she notices nothing else.
Watch this.
Auntie.
I'm marrying Tita because
the poor girl's crazy.
Tita...
the wedding is next week...
so if there's a problem,
let's discuss it now.
John, we'd better
cancel the wedding.
But why?
Don't make me tell you now.
You don't love me anymore?
I don't know.
While you were away...
I was with a man...
whom I have always loved.
I lost my virginity.
That's why
we can't get married.
Do you love him
more than you love me?
When you're not here...
I feel that he's the one I love.
But when I see you,
everything changes.
With you I feel calm...
safe...
at peace...
but I don't know--
I don't know.
I don't care what happened.
It's not important if it
didn't change what's essential.
I want to be your partner
for life.
You decide whether you want me
to be your partner.
If you say yes,
we'll get married in a few days.
If not, I'll be the first
to congratulate Pedro...
and also...
the first to ask him...
to demand...
that he give you
what you deserve.
Remember the first time
we heard that song?
I'll never forget.
I didn't sleep that night...
thinking about
asking for your hand.
I didn't know
it would take 22 years...
before I could ask you again
to be my wife.
Do you mean that?
Of course!
I don't want to die
without having you be my wife.
I always dreamed
of walking with you...
into a church
full of white flowers...
and you, the most beautiful
of them all.
Dressed in white?
Of course!
There's nothing to stop you.
Besides, I want us
to have a child.
There's still time,
don't you think?
Now that Esperanza is married
and is leaving...
we'll need company.
And no one can convince me
otherwise.
I don't care what my daughter
or anyone else thinks.
We wasted many years worrying
about what others might say.
Poor Rosaura.
If she hadn't died...
she'd really have enjoyed
her daughter's wedding.
You think so? She told me...
that she'd never
let her get married...
that Tita protected that girl
like a fiend...
and that the house
became a battlefield.
That's right.
But let me cry, all right?
Fortunately the fights
between Tita and Rosaura...
didn't last long.
Because three days after...
their most violent
and tearful fight...
Rosaura died
of severe digestive problems.
Ah! Senorita Gertrudis!
Look how elegant!
Thank God you came.
It's a pleasure.
Look at this beautiful girl!
She looks just like
her grandfather.
How handsome!
Congratulations, Pedro.
Your daughter couldn't have
found a better match than Alex.
Yes, Alex Brown
is an excellent man.
Too bad he got
a Ph.D. scholarship at Harvard.
Bad? That's excellent!
No. He's taking her along
with him, and we'll be...
left alone.
How awful!
What will you do, Tita?
Without Esperanza,
it'll look bad...
if you stay here
and live with Pedro.
Oh, but before you leave,
give me the recipe...
for these chilies.
They are heavenly.
The secret is to make them
with lots of love.
I hope you'll get them right
someday.
How crude!
Your son is a handsome groom.
Isn't it nice that
he married Esperanza?
Yes.
Yes, it's true.
Then why are you sad?
Get happy. Dance with me.
My husband isn't here.
The next song, Chencha.
Be happy, my child.
I love you.
We're all alone.
I love you!
Nobody hears us.
I love you!
If an intense emotion...
lights all the matches
inside of us all at once...
the brilliance would...
make us see a radiant tunnel...
showing us a path
that we forgot at birth.
The soul will want to return
to its divine origin.
When Esperanza, my mother,
returned from her honeymoon...
all she found under
what remained of the ranch...
was this cookbook
she left me when she died.
It tells the story
of this buried love.
My mother, Esperanza!
How I miss her cooking...
the smell of her kitchen...
her talking while
she prepared the meals...
her Christmas rolls.
Mine never come out like hers.
And I wonder why I cry so much
while I make them.
It must be that I'm as sensitive
to onions as Tita...
my great-aunt.
She'll continue to live as long
as someone cooks her recipes.
