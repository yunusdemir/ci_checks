No way,
I'll get in so much trouble.
Yeah, maybe we can just
figure something out tomorrow?
Oh, come on,
why do you have to be so lame?
- Let's just go now.
- It's seriously almost 1:00 a.m.
and I'm already gonna get
in so much trouble.
So, what's the difference, then?
Yeah, okay, yeah,
we really need to go.
It's late, and...
Whatever, dude,
don't worry about it.
So lame.
Hey, yeah, you know what?
Maybe we are lame!
Hey, don't argue with them
let's just leave.
I wasn't gonna go anyways.
You know they're
only after one thing.
Yeah, guys are pigs.
First off, Mikhail,
I told you, not here.
Not in my office!
I thought we understood
each other.
I hear you no like my business.
But I'm paying,
I don't understand.
Five women.
Excuse me, three young teenagers
and two 20-year-old women
were abducted from my city
by your thugs!
- I have high demands. I needed...
- You don't need shit!
You don't understand!
I have to answer for this!
The Chief and I,
we're taking too much heat
because you didn't keep
your promise!
Maybe business will slow down.
Maybe I won't need so many
for a while.
Yeah, sure.
Listen,
I will do what I do, no matter
if you take the money or no.
What would you do,
go to the police?
You don't get it, do you?
You're leaving me no choice!
Think.
What's good for me
is good for you.
Maybe I slow down.
Maybe I go to the suburbs
a little.
Oh, yeah, sure.
This is no need to stop
our business.
I know you like my candy
too well.
Best we think on this, hmm?
Jesus Christ!
Hey, sweetie.
We still on for dinner?
- This year is it.
- You're crazy!
I think they have two or three
good years left
before they're done.
- No, no way.
- Yeah.
Excuse me, they found
another body in a dumpster.
Damn.
Gettin' bad out there.
The coroner's bringing her in.
How old?
Do they even know?
No, but she's, uh, young,
under 30.
Shit.
Alderman needs to take
a strong public stand on this.
Yeah.
All right, let's get to work.
Hey!
Before you leave...
- we need to check your sleeves.
- No one cleans us out like that.
I won fair and square.
Is that so?
Let's see those sleeves.
Listen, brick head, you
and your dumbass friend lost.
Now, you could either lose again
right here and right now
or you could walk away.
You must think I'm
some kinda pussy, huh?
Last warning.
Fuck you!
Your mother ever tell you
not to point?
Now, you have a choice...
learn from your friend...
or make the same mistake.
- You tough, man?
- Bad move.
Next time you guys
have a poker game...
work on your hospitality.
Wow...
this is amazing!
Well, we see each other
so infrequently,
I thought this time
should be special.
And your mother would be
very happy to see you with this.
And, uh, you know,
since you're my only daughter,
- you're all I got left.
- You have the city, Dad.
And that's your true baby
and you know it!
I got a lot of responsibilities,
- it's different.
- I understand. I...
I can't even imagine
how much you have on your plate.
Yeah, there's a lot on my plate.
But how about you,
how you doing?
I don't know I'm more
of the same, or whatever.
Hey.
You'll find your calling
in due time.
- Well, let's hope so.
- I'll bet on it.
Uh, I gotta get up early
tomorrow. What about you?
Yeah.
Are we still on for breakfast
this Friday?
Yes, yeah, we are.
- So, do we have? Yeah.
- The money?
Yeah, of course.
- Clean and unmarked.
- Great.
I appreciate it, thanks.
And listen...
I'm gonna shut down
the Russians.
You should let me take care
of the...
No, listen,
I cannot afford to have
a gang war in my city.
You see?
And, uh, I can't take care
of you if there is one.
- It won't be a war.
- Please, trust me on this.
- Okay?
- If you say so.
Good. A few anonymous tips,
they'll be in prison,
maybe in less than six
months, for a long time.
I would rather he be dead.
No.
Trust me on this.
Yeah, yeah.
I trust you'll look out for me
as long as I'm paying you.
I trust that, all right?
Let me see this closely.
Drive careful.
Christy, take a look
at this one.
It's beautiful.
It is.
You have flawless taste, Miss.
- Thank you.
- Who made it?
A young artist, he has a lot
of depth and soul in his work.
J.B. Davies?
- Never heard of him.
- Hmm, he's up and coming.
- I'm sure.
- How much is it?
This particular piece
is only 2800 dollars.
I'll take it.
You like that?
Let's go.
- What?
- Let's go have some fun.
Go where?
Well, you know...
she's just the same
as the others.
She died of an
acute drug overdose.
Damn.
Three in a month
and we pretty much have nothing.
I know.
I've never seen
anything like it, ever.
- You finding anything?
- No, nothing yet.
Whoa!
Look here.
See that?
The organs look fried.
- This could be a homicide.
- I don't know.
But, she sure didn't do this
to herself.
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.
But you know,
she's been on heroin
for at least a year
according to
the hair follicle test we did.
- What?
- Uh.
- Wait, I, um...
- What?
- Uh, I think I know her.
- What?
- Really?
- No, not exactly know, but I,
I think she jogs the same trail
as me, or she used to.
A heroin junkie that jogs?
I don't know,
but I'm pretty sure it's her.
Well, I think I've seen
everything then.
Okay, so what does that have
to do with me?
I need your help, Wolf.
I can't have the cartel
and the Russians both picking
our girls up off our streets.
- <i>Uh, you shouldn't have either.</i>
- I understand, Mike.
But, uh,
you know, it's a big city.
<i>I can't control everything.</i>
- Is that so?
- But I've made a decision.
So what do you want from me?
<i>Like I said,</i>
Mikhail and his Ruskies,
they're out of control.
I see.
Uh, keep me posted.
Wolf...
don't judge me.
You're no choir boy.
No, no, I am not.
The mayor's asked
that I not do business
with you anymore.
Fuck the mayor.
I wish it was that easy.
It is, unless you're afraid
of him.
No, Mikhail,
I'm not afraid of the mayor.
It's not about that.
It's just that he can make
our lives a lot easier if...
I can make his life easier
or harder, too.
- I'm sure you can, but...
- But? No but.
You want the business or not?
I don't have a problem with you,
Mikhail.
I thought we could talk
like men.
All he wants you to do
is respect the rules.
Fuck the mayor, fuck his rules.
Well, why don't we do that, hmm?
Fuck the mayor, fuck his rules,
fuck me, fuck you.
- He's just as dirty as you or I.
- Whatever, you're right.
It's your decision.
But I want you to know...
that I'm with you, Mikhail.
But I also want you to know
that I am not going down
with you.
Am I clear?
It's what I like about you,
Stone.
You are always very clear.
Still wanna go there?
Yeah, I'm a grown-ass woman.
I don't need to ask permission.
I know but, still.
Look, I get what you mean, but,
Foxtrot is the hot spot
right now.
You know it is.
I know,
it's not the kind of place
the mayor's daughter
should be hanging out at.
Oh, come on.
We can always go
to Grasshoppers.
How about we go to Foxtrot?
And if it isn't on fire...
then we go to Grasshoppers.
You know it'll be on fire
and you're gonna get in trouble.
You only live once.
Yeah, you're right.
Darryl...
find her.
You sure about this?
Okay.
<i>Hey.</i>
I need you to trace someone
for me.
<i>Okay, name?</i>
Marie Alderman.
Oh, shit, that's funny!
- <i>Okay, a real name?</i>
- Marie Allison Alderman.
You're serious?
<i>I am.</i>
I'm gonna have
to sit this one out.
<i>Darryl, it's too risky.</i>
Maybe you wanna take that up
with Mikhail?
Shit.
All right, I'll trace her,
but you should really try
to talk some sense into him.
<i>Not my job.</i>
All right,
whatever you say, man.
Just get it done.
She's here.
- What?
- She's at the club.
Hey, can we get
two Johnny Vegas?
You got it.
Hey, we should go sit down.
- Okay.
- All right.
That'll be 30 dollars.
It's on me, Marco.
Thank you, but we can pay
for our own drinks.
- Trust me, it's no problem.
- Okay then, thank you.
Why don't you come with me?
<i>You're either in or you're out.</i>
It's not that easy!
Oh, it's not?
Let me make it easier for you.
Motherfucker!
Fuck!
Hey girl, what's up?
Are you out?
Yeah, at Foxtrot with Marie.
Why?
- <i>Mind if I join you?</i>
- No, not at all.
Okay, cool. See you in a few.
So...
what do you do?
If you don't mind me asking.
This, this is mine, the club.
And, uh...
I have some other investments.
UM, Sandra just called,
she's on her way.
Did you wanna go wait
for her by the bar?
You can always come back here.
Bring your friend.
Thank you.
- Hello?
- <i>Hey.</i>
<i>Remember the girl we had
in here?</i>
<i>The heroin girl, the runner?</i>
Uh, yeah.
<i>Well, I found something.</i>
<i>It wasn't murder.</i>
I mean...
I guess it was,
but it wasn't intentional.
- What?
- <i>When can you come in here?</i>
I wanna show you.
Uh, on my way.
I cannot believe
that we just hung out with him.
In his booth, too!
Oh, my God.
Let's hope no pictures surface
of this one
because I will never hear
the end of it.
We don't really know if all that
stuff they say
about him is true.
I guess.
I so needed to get out.
Just drinking.
- I'm sorry.
- That's a bummer.
It's fine, it's just...
No, it should have
ended a while ago.
Well,
let's get you a drink, then.
Let's do it!
- Hey.
- Hey, Alex.
I'm glad you could
come so quickly.
No problem.
- So what did we find?
- Well,
I received some more information
on girl number one.
- Angela, was it?
- Yes.
Well, it turns out she
wasn't always an addict.
Or I should say,
- she wasn't one for very long.
- So the overdose was a cover up?
Much worse.
Worse?
I mean,
the heroin that killed her
wasn't even injected.
I mean, it wasn't even supposed
to kill her.
- What do you mean?
- Take a look over here.
See this,
see the shadowing over here?
Mm-hmm.
Well, she had heroin
bags implanted inside her.
And the only thing I can think
of is one,
you know, one must have leaked
and that's,
I'd say, I can see it
on the kidneys here.
Take a look.
Oh.
So, I went back and I looked
at the other girls and,
although nothing is confirmed
yet...
they most likely died
in a similar fashion.
A slow leak...
you know,
just enough to kill them.
And these, these bastards...
they just harvested the bags
and discarded the bodies.
I, uh...
I'll be damned.
This changes everything.
They were drug mules.
Exactly.
We just can't seem to pin him
for anything.
It's fine that we're in the same
building as him right now?
Mm.
You're sure we're safe, right?
Yeah, I mean as long
as you stay away from his booth.
Besides, if he tries anything...
- I'll kick his ass.
- That is why we're best friends.
Sandy...
we need to talk.
There's nothing left
to talk about.
What the hell?
You act like this is all on me!
You said you needed a break.
So I gave you one, permanently.
That's because I'm always
playing second fiddle
- to your fucking job!
- Oh, really?
You knew what you were
in for dating me.
I mean, you knew exactly
what you were getting into.
You knew what I did
for a living.
Yeah...
and I didn't know how consumed
you would be by it.
I think you need to go.
- Oh, should I?
- Yeah.
Are you allergic to spending
time with your boyfriend?
Ex-boyfriend.
You know what?
Fuck you anyways!
Okay, buddy, take a walk.
This ain't none
of your fucking business!
I said walk.
Okay, asshole, let's go!
Who the hell was that guy?
I don't know but we seen
him with Mikhail earlier.
I'm just gonna make
sure nothing bad happens.
- I'm coming with.
- Wait for me, guys!
You gonna be cool
if I let you go?
- Yes.
- Yeah?
- Yes!
- All right.
What the fuck are you doing?
You need to calm down.
Don't fucking touch me!
Is this how you want it, Sandy?
Huh?
That was pretty fucking stupid!
Hey, are you okay?
I don't know.
Yeah, I'm fine.
You?
Don't worry about me.
You okay?
Where's Marie?
I don't know.
Is that your friend?
Yeah, did you see
where she went?
No, I was kind of busy.
Maybe she went back in.
Maybe.
Hey.
Hey, sorry I missed your call.
I'm at Foxtrot.
Yeah, I'm just leaving
the morgue.
- Another one?
- No.
But new information,
these girls were likely
used to smuggle drugs.
- What?
- Yeah, they were drug mules.
<i>Oh, that's crazy. I...</i>
But hey, I have a bit
of a situation here.
Uh, Brad came, made a scene,
started a fight.
He what?
Long story, but I also managed
to lose Marie in this mess.
So, if you don't mind
picking me up?
- <i>Yeah, sure I'll be there in 20.</i>
- Cool, thanks, bye.
Oh, my God!
Hello?
Oh, hello?
Please, please answer me!
Oh, my God!
So, to what do I owe...
for this...
pleasure?
I'm pretty sure you know
why I'm here.
Maybe I do.
Maybe I don't.
I don't like to assume things,
Carlos.
The Russian,
he's getting shut down.
And I know
you have high level clients
that will need service
when that happens.
The Russian
is getting shut down?
Is that so?
Carlos, have you ever met
Mikhail?
No.
I don't see how that has
anything to do with anything.
You haven't met him.
That's why you don't see.
Mikhail...
isn't...
wired like the rest of us.
Uh-uh.
You know what I mean?
Pretty soon he
won't be wired at all.
I assure you...
you're not the first
to say that.
And yet...
he's still here.
In Chicago I wiped people
like him off the streets...
until it was mine.
Carlos...
this is Detroit.
Not Chicago!
Things are different here.
I came here to extend an offer,
not to listen to you defend
the Russian.
I'm not defending the Russian.
I'm making sure
you have some idea
of what you're getting yourself
into.
I guess you'll go down
with him, then.
Carlos.
Only time will tell.
Only time will tell.
Last chance.
Switch now or hang
onto the Russian and be done.
I believe you already
asked that question.
Down goes Frazier.
Hey, there you are.
We still can't find Marie.
That's weird.
She wouldn't just leave us
like this.
I know.
Someone had to
have seen where she went.
I mean,
maybe she did leave.
She would have said something.
Settle down or we'll have
to put you back to sleep.
What do you want, money?
I have money, please.
- Let me go!
- Shut her up.
No, please.
Charge her up slowly.
Okay.
- She's not for play, Karpov.
- I understand.
She's worth too much.
Don't fuck it up.
Yes?
<i>That detective is still here.</i>
She wants to go through
the club after we close.
Let her,
we have nothing to hide.
All right, I just wanted you
to make the call.
Cooperate, it's better.
All right.
You ready to make me some money,
yet?
Uh-huh.
I don't get it.
She's not answering her phone,
she's not here.
Look, I'm really sorry, but
I'm sure she just left
with some guy.
Trust me, it happens
all the time.
Well, here is my card.
Call me if you find anything
or if she turns up.
Sure thing.
Hey,
I assume those work?
Yeah, they should.
Do you have them
all around?
Yeah, we got pretty good
coverage.
I'd like to see the footage.
Of course, but not tonight.
Unfortunately,
Mikhail's the only one
who has access
to the security room.
I'd like to set that
up as soon as possible.
Yeah, I'll give him a call.
You ladies have a good night.
You, too.
- <i>Da?</i>
- <i>We got a problem.</i>
- Good morning, Laura.
- Good morning.
Did you get any messages
from my daughter this morning?
No, no sir. Um,
let me double check
the voicemail.
Thanks.
- Sir?
- Yes?
Nope, no message.
Mayor Alderman's office,
Mrs. Moore speaking.
<i>Hi, it's Sandra.</i>
<i>Wait, it's Sandra Miller.</i>
Marie's friend. Is Donald in?
Yes, are you with Marie?
No, that's why I'm calling.
Okay, um, hold on.
- Mayor Alderman?
- Yes?
It's, uh, Sandra on the phone
for you.
Sandra?
Yes, Marie's friend,
Sandra Miller.
Oh, okay, thanks.
- Hello?
- <i>Hi, it's Sandra.</i>
Have you seen
or talked to Marie today?
Sandra...
no, uh, we were supposed
to have breakfast this morning
but she didn't show up.
Yeah, I don't know
what to do here.
We kind of lost track
of each other
at Foxtrot last night.
Foxtrot,
you mean Kovalchek's place?
<i>Yes.</i>
Whose idea was that?
Sir, it wasn't my call.
I showed up later.
I'm sorry, no, just...
What else were you gonna say?
Well, she just vanished.
I don't like this.
I know, neither do I.
I'm heading over
to Foxtrot at 11
to go over surveillance videos
and see if I can find anything.
Let me know of anything
you find.
I'm still hoping it's nothing,
but...
<i>So do I.</i>
But...
...never mind.
She's awake.
Wake up!
Can you hear me?
- Where am I?
- I'm here to check on you.
What?
Where am I?
Just relax
so I can check you out.
No!
Listen,
you're gonna do what I say.
I can make your life very
unpleasant if you don't listen.
Am I clear?
You don't have to do this.
Mikhail said
careful with this one.
Are we clear?
Settle down!
Calm down
or I put you to sleep again.
Why are you doing this?
I have money,
I can get all kinds of money!
Please,
you don't need to do this!
Goodnight.
No, as of right now
we don't have anyone in custody,
but we're working several leads.
Excuse me,
Mayor Alderman, sir?
What are you doing
to combat this epidemic?
We have a task force
that's, uh, being led by two
of our very best detectives
and we have four...
four very good officers
supporting them.
Excuse me,
I hear another body turned up.
Can you confirm that?
Uh...
Yes...
unfortunately we've been told
about, uh, the finding
of a woman's body
and yet, uh, at this moment
we have no more information.
Okay, last question.
There are rumors
surrounding a certain individual
who both attended and donated
to your charity
at your last event.
The rumors involve this person
having ties to
these disappearances. Mr. Mayor,
are you aware of any ties?
Well, this is news to me.
Um, I just want you to know
I won't turn down any offers
to my charity.
But to answer your question,
the facts are that
no, there's... there's no...
no evidence of any of our donors
in any way
being associated
to these abductions.
All right, listen, I appreciate
your questions but I have to go.
<i>I will let the Chief take over.
Thank you.</i>
That's a good boy.
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
<i>All right,
you heard the mayor.</i>
<i>We'll keep you updated
as we learn more.</i>
- You did good.
- <i>Trust me,</i>
we're putting in the resources.
We will get to the bottom
of this.
Thank you for your time.
Detective.
I apologize,
but it seems like our cameras
weren't working
properly last night.
They weren't working properly?
Sometimes they short
and we have to reset
for them to work properly again.
Huh.
I mean do you...
You do realize how
bad that sounds?
Someone's missing,
last seen at your club and
the security system's
conveniently off.
Look...
the surveillance system
is to protect my property,
not to catch women
leaving the club with men,
leaving their friends behind.
Are you saying she
left with someone?
What else?
I don't know.
But...
it's not like Marie
to just vanish.
If you know what is like Marie,
maybe you shouldn't work
the case.
You're very confident.
I bet you think you're smarter
than all of us. That...
you'll get away with this,
but your days are numbered.
Is there anything else
I can help you with, Detective?
No...
I think I have everything
that I need.
See the detective out.
I can show myself out. Thanks.
Okay.
Hey, what's up?
<i>It's him, Mikhail.</i>
What?
He had some footage
from outside the club.
<i>He said the cameras
sometimes glitch.</i>
And I take it
you don't buy that?
Not for a minute.
<i>He was enjoying it.
I'm gonna put this fucker away.</i>
I hear you.
We have to be careful.
One screw-up and he could walk.
Yeah, I know.
Look, I need to tell the mayor.
Okay.
It hasn't been that long, Mayor.
I still remember not having to
lock our doors when I grew up.
Please...
this reality is now...
and it's not happening just
here, it's happening everywhere.
I don't care about everywhere
else. I care about here!
- I understand, sir.
- Do you?
My daughter's best
friend is missing.
She's been gone
for over two weeks
and she's not the only one!
- What's it gonna take?
- Listen, sir
I've activated a task force
with a specific focus
on trafficking
and it has my full support.
The two detectives? How is that
gonna change anything?
Each of those officers
are the very best.
And together, believe me...
they're much better than none.
And they have the support
of four,
four experienced officers
who also have the support
of our full force.
Please!
That's not good enough.
We're losing our daughters here,
sir!
Good.
You'll have to excuse me
I have to take care
- of some other business, please.
- Look at these girls!
Look at them!
What is it gonna take?
Does it have to be one of yours
for you to take this seriously?
I am sorry, sir.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry to bother you, sir.
But I think the
Russians took her.
What?
It's just too many things
not adding up.
Look, I'll update you
with more details, but,
after meeting with Mikhail
and finding out
that the outside footage
is missing
from a perfectly good
surveillance system,
I've determined
that it's likely them,
- or they're in on it.
- Listen, Sandra.
You have to find her.
You know what these animals,
you know what these animals do
to girls.
I know.
I'm on it.
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Just find her!
Damn.
- This is her?
- Yes, that's her.
- But, she's not blond.
- Look, blond.
It's colored,
her roots are dark.
For 10,000 dollars
you don't get genuine blond.
You know this.
- But, seriously, we...
- We'll take her.
Do you have any
higher end girls?
Maybe younger?
Of course, how young?
Teens, virgins? Let's say...
100,000 dollars?
I'm sure we can find
something you'll like.
Get this one ready.
Let me see what else we have.
- You're sure it's him?
- <i>Who else?</i>
And even if he didn't,
I'm sure he's connected.
- I'm certain.
- <i>Oh.</i>
Any chance he'll give
her up if he has her?
I doubt it,
maybe just to save his own skin.
Uh, if I go poking at Mr. Stone
I need backup.
It's a higher risk
engagement, so to speak.
Whatever you need.
<i>It's my daughter,
for Christ's sake!</i>
Enough to at least get
someone to watch my back.
Ideally, two.
But it's not gonna be
cheap or easy to find them.
Like I said,
whatever you need.
All right...
if I had about a quarter,
I'd be set.
<i>You got it.</i>
All right, well,
let me make a few calls
and, uh, don't worry, I'm on it.
Good.
Good.
Hey, you.
Come here.
<i>Nyet.</i>
Please.
Please talk to me.
We both noticed each
other at the club.
Noticed each other?
Yeah.
Just...
help me outta here and, uh,
I'll take care of you.
That's not going to happen.
Let me out of these
for a little bit?
Why?
So, I can show you.
Show me what?
Something.
I have... I have a thing
for tough guys like you.
Better?
Better.
So show me.
What's gonna happen?
I just wish we could leave.
Well, we can't...
so come on.
- Okay.
- Yes.
Okay.
Okay, get in.
What's going on?
I just asked for water.
Don't be stupid, Marie.
Be good,
or you will end up dead
in a ditch
after they all take a turn
on you.
- Karpov!
- <i>Da?</i>
Don't fuck this up!
Or I swear I will have Mikhail
use you as shark bait
the next time he goes fishing!
What?
And keep your little
worm in your pants, okay?
Eight ball, corner pocket.
Fuck.
You hustled me!
And I ain't paying nobody
to play me!
Listen, never touch my clothes.
In fact, never touch me, period.
- Am I clear?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Now use your other hand
and give me my money.
What can I get for you?
- Talk to me.
- <i>I need you.</i>
And his opponent, you all
know him, still undefeated,
a man who goes by one name only.
Here is Alpha!
Again, a man who goes by
one name only.
Here is Alpha!
Gentlemen, center.
One of the rules of locker room,
there are no rules. Separate.
Let's fight!
Let's fight!
Oh!
Can we subpoena
the video cameras
and see if they were tampered
with?
We can.
- Then we should.
- Yeah.
I just don't understand
how they could have snatched her
right from under your nose.
It must have been in
the commotion with Brad.
I saw Kovalchek leave with
one of his goons in a van.
It was a windowless white van.
All right,
we can check gas stations
with road views on either side,
see if we can get a plate.
Or stake it out,
see if it comes back.
Yeah, we could stake out
the club
and see if it pops up again.
Yeah.
- Let's check in with Chief.
- Good idea, let's go.
- Hey, Chief.
- Yeah?
We have something.
All right, talk to me.
We should be able to subpoena
the video with a search warrant.
Let me see if I can get
Judge Reinhold on the phone.
Also, I saw a white
windowless van leave the scene.
Can we put out an APB?
Why don't you stake the place
out and see if they come again?
Let's do both.
- All right, sounds good.
- Thanks, Chief.
Yep.
All right,
I'll check the parking lot,
you check the club.
Okay.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Uh, sorry I was so short
last night.
Your boss wasn't very nice.
It's fine, I understand.
And thanks for stepping in
with Brad.
It's okay, just doing my job.
Can I buy you a drink?
Uh, sure.
So, how did you end up
with these guys?
What, how did I end up
with the owner
and the crew managing this bar?
You know what I mean.
It's a good gig.
Mikhail, he, he looked
after me for a while.
He was friends with my dad
when he passed, and...
my mom, she OD'd
a few years earlier, so,
I was on the streets
fending for myself.
When he found out...
he took me in.
But now he's using you.
Your chief uses you
like any boss uses an employee.
What's the difference?
You're smarter than that.
You know the difference
between right and wrong
and a false sense of loyalty
has you working
against who you are.
What do you want me to say?
How I feel stuck?
Or how I regret crossing
to the dark side?
Or how I live in fear?
Something like that?
I'm gonna tell you something.
There's no dark side,
there's no light side.
There's just shades of gray.
Well, I'd like you on my side.
Shade of gray.
You seem like a good man.
No?
That about it, detective?
I guess so.
It's on the house, by the way.
Anything?
Nope, not a thing.
You?
Nada.
Hey, man.
How's business?
Business is good, as always.
That detective...
she came by again.
- Don't worry about her.
- I'm not, they just left.
Karpov, go check if
they're still here.
They left.
- Check anyways.
- All right.
What did she say?
I don't think
they have anything,
but she seems pretty determined
it's you who took her.
The baggage will be gone
tomorrow.
That's good.
Welcome.
Hey, you, wake up!
Fuck you.
I was trying to be nice.
Okay.
Here we go.
First question.
Did you take
Mayor Alderman's daughter?
I took your mother.
I'll ask you one more time.
Did you take the
Mayor's daughter?
Fuck you.
Is that the best you've got?
What do you think, I'm a cop?
You think I have rules?
Cash.
Kill me, I'm not talking.
Where's the fun in that?
Fuck you!
Nails grow back.
We're not finished yet.
Where is she?
In your mother's bed.
After I fucked them both...
- they needed the rest.
- This guy's a real dirt bag.
Level two.
Level two,
now I'm scared.
I'll take it to the grave.
See, I know you're in
a hurry to get there...
but if you don't talk...
I can make this last forever.
Okay.
Let's try this one more time.
Hey, you know what, Cash?
He don't look ready.
Why don't you take another
one before I ask him again?
Pleasure.
Help. Help me, please!
Help me!
Please, save me.
No!
No!
No!
Please, save me.
Where's Karpov?
I don't think he's here.
Go find him.
All right.
I can't find him.
What you mean
you can't find him?
I mean I can't find him,
he's not here.
Oh, what do we got here?
Hello?
Who is this?
I'm just babysitting this phone.
Who are you?
<i>Listen motherfucker,</i>
<i>you put Karpov on the phone
right now.</i>
Okay.
Hey Karpov...
you got a phone call.
I think it's your boss.
I'm all right.
<i>Don't worry about me.</i>
Actually,
he's not doing so hot.
Look, I will find you
and when I find you
I will cut you up
into little pieces, you p...
Hey, shut up and listen
for a second!
<i>What do you want?</i>
Simple.
I trade you one barely alive
Russian piece of shit
for the mayor's daughter.
- What?
- <i>Better hurry it up.</i>
He's not gonna be alive
much longer.
Fuck you, you can have him.
I have lots of Karpovs.
I think you just got fired.
So you're just gonna let them
kill him?
- He's as good as dead.
- But he's not dead yet!
He is already dead!
Fuck!
What the fuck you looking at?
Oh, my God, she's gone!
Bring her to me!
- She's gone!
- <i>What?</i>
Marie is gone!
<i>And there
was another drive-by...</i>
- Yeah?
- She got out.
<i>What?</i>
She got out.
I don't know how, but...
she couldn't have made it far.
Well, I think you should know.
The mayor, yeah,
talk to the mayor for me.
Where's your daughter?
Fuck.
<i>...found last
week in the river...</i>
Yeah, that's right.
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah, go check on my credit.
Jack, you stay here.
Come on, Stone,
you're smarter than that.
Does that hurt?
Yeah, it looks painful.
You know...
I wonder how long it would take
you to bleed to death?
I'd say five hours, maybe six.
Without help, without care,
you're a dead man.
What do you want from me, hmm?
Where's the mayor's daughter?
School? I don't know!
I have no idea
what you're talking about.
Wrong answer.
Mom?
Mom?
Sandra, Sandra!
- Oh, shit, shh!
- Sandra, don't let them find me.
There's no one here,
let's get you home.
I give up, don't shoot!
I'm unarmed.
Come slowly towards me
with your hands on top
of your head.
Just give me the location.
It'll be over.
I'm bleeding out.
I'll be gone soon anyway.
Ah, I can fix that.
See?
Now we have time.
We just went from hours left...
to several days,
maybe even weeks.
But if I get the address...
I'll put a bullet in your head
and it's over.
Yeah, a big part of me really
wants...
you to reveal it...
but the other part of me...
is curious.
How long will you last?
Hey, pretty elaborate, isn't it?
So what do you say?
Address or this?
I am curious
so I don't mind giving this
a try.
Oh, the strong, silent type.
Okay, Cash...
give him a little taste.
All right, enough.
You already know,
I won't talk so...
Let's end this.
No, no, no, no. Don't you see?
That's the beauty of this.
You decide how much pain
there will be.
I've offered you a way out.
Look at me.
I don't know...
where it is.
That's it.
The truth...
is closer to you
than your breath.
Hit him up.
Now...
why don't you tell
the big, bad wolf...
what he needs to hear?
Looks like I get two for one.
Pretty for a detective.
Don't even fucking touch me,
you pig!
Did you radio your location?
Fuck you!
Don't you fucking touch her!
You're already dead
and you don't even know it.
Fuck you!
- Did you radio your location?
- Don't you fucking touch...
Let's relocate.
You better not be lying.
Liar,
liar, liar, liar.
Liar, I'm a...
liar.
Liar, liar...
pants on fire.
Look at you.
You should have
chosen more wisely.
Carlos.
Nice to see you, Carlos.
It's not too late.
Join me...
and I let you go.
No, no, no.
No?
I'm not joining you.
I decided.
I
don't want...
Okay.
Oh, a gun?
Bye, bye.
I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?
I'm gonna get you outta here.
Just trust me.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I'm getting you outta here.
I'm getting you all outta here.
It's okay, he's on our side.
You gotta be quiet. Okay?
I'm getting you outta here,
okay?
- I'm getting you outta here.
- He's on our side.
He's getting us out of here.
Shh, it's okay.
I got you, okay, shh!
I'm getting you
outta here, okay?
It's okay. It's gonna be fine.
All right. It's gonna be okay.
Okay.
Come here, okay.
Hey, man.
Everything's good out there?
Yeah, they're just getting
the bodies out of the way.
So they're out there now?
No, I think
they're dumping them.
Okay, let's hope that's it
and no more are coming, right?
Yeah, man, no shit.
- I'm not leaving you, Jessie!
- Please, go.
I want you to live!
- We gotta go now!
- No, I'm not leaving her!
Do you wanna fucking die here?
Come on!
Wait, wait,
wait something's wrong!
We don't have time for this!
We gotta move!
Listen up,
these bastards will be locked
and loaded on their home turf.
Watch your sixes.
We work together...
as one.
Hell, yeah.
- Team work.
- Yeah, there's no I in team.
- Semper fi.
- That's right.
Move the other girls.
We need to get out of here
as soon as possible.
Okay, boss, where you going?
- I need to take care of things.
- Remember, they can be off IV's
for maybe an hour before
they start clearing up. Okay?
See you at back up.
If you see Darryl,
I want him alive.
I can't do this.
What?
But you helped us.
Of course,
we're not gonna turn you in!
No, you see,
I don't think I can stay out
of Mikhail's reach.
I gotta do this the only way
I know how.
What do you mean?
I gotta face him.
- That's suicide, Darryl.
- Turning myself in is suicide.
Come on.
- We have programs that...
- Sandra, you know what I mean!
You know how our world works.
I'm gonna be looking
over my shoulder
for the rest of my life.
I got a feeling
I'm gonna be short lived.
Sandra...
...can't they help him?
He's right.
I hate to say it,
but he's right.
Go to the car.
This is your loyalty?
Don't you fucking talk to me
about loyalty
after you let them kill Karpov!
He was already dead.
You really think
they would let him go?
You should have traded!
We would all be dead.
Listen to me.
I'm out, okay?
What do you want, my blessing?
I want your word,
that if I help you
take these guys out
I don't have to look
over my shoulder
for the rest of my life
wondering if I'm gonna be
at the receiving end
of your gun.
Okay, deal.
I trust you.
Time I go see this mayor.
Okay...
I'll check on Stone.
They're on their way.
Good.
How you feeling?
I don't feel so hot.
You?
I feel sick,
drained.
Where is she? Marie!
- Dad!
- Marie, sweetie!
Sweetie, I'm here!
Are you okay?
Oh, poor baby!
Oh, baby, I'm sorry!
How is it?
Are you in pain?
Sweetie, you okay? Is it...
Oh, God.
Did we get them yet?
No, not yet,
they're on their way.
Yeah?
I can put every one
of those fuckers in jail
for their rest of their life!
But I want you to take him out.
Do you understand?
Do you understand?
Chief?
- Yeah?
- I'd really like to be there.
No, Sandra, not an option.
Sir, they killed my partner.
And I'm not losing
you both tonight!
You're recovering,
you go home, rest.
I'd tell you to go to
the hospital, but I know better.
Go home, I'll keep you updated.
Hey, can we get outta here?
Yeah, but she's been drugged.
She needs to be examined.
I know, I know.
She's got a doctor
coming to the house,
don't worry.
- She needs some help.
- Listen, you just take him out!
I hope that's all she needs.
Cash, how you feeling?
I don't know, man.
I don't like this at all.
It feels like we're just
sitting ducks out in the open.
Just breathe.
Just keep breathing.
Truth.
All right...
let's roll.
Show time.
Boom.
Dr. Spellman said
he'd be here in a few minutes.
I feel sick.
It's the drugs. You're...
probably gonna have
a few rough days.
But you're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be all right.
I just wanna wake up
from this nightmare, Dad.
I understand.
Hey, you're a champ.
That's the doc.
- How dare you fuck with me!
- What are you doing?
What are you doing?
- You bring in the cartel!
- What, they pay you more?
What are you talking about?
You tell me everything you know
and you tell me now.
No, please!
Don't, you know the police
are coming here!
- You can't stay here!
- Why are you here?
- No!
- She's a great fuck.
- Help me!
- Don't you dare!
- You!
- Now you tell me everything
or I will fuck her right
in front of you
and I will tape your eyes open
so you have to watch!
No, please!
Please, don't!
You tell me.
Last warning.
God!
I don't need you anymore.
I can get you out!
I can stop them!
I can shut down the cartel!
I can stop the police right now!
You and her,
you gotta save yourselves!
I can help you right now! Don't!
I convict you
of treason, Mayor.
Oh, my God!
Cash!
Freeze!
Officer...
we're not with them.
We're here to get
Marie back safely.
Well, you're too late.
She's at home with her father.
That's good.
You mind if I verify that?
Go right ahead.
Keep those guns down.
Well, no answer.
Freeze!
Fuck!
- Darryl?
- Yeah?
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'll be fine.
I can never trust
you again.
Sounds like you are out
of bullets.
I count nine.
Sounds like you don't have
any more either.
Maybe I do, maybe I don't.
Okay.
Let's...
find...
out.
I am not afraid of you.
Let's settle this...
a different way.
Your muscles make you slow.
Your lack of
muscles make you weak!
Jesus, Mikhail...
you're done.
It's over!
The cops are on their way.
It's done!
You can't shoot an unarmed man.
How about a drink?
Sounds good.
