Teacher Gao!
Teacher Gao!
He's washing his hair.
Wait here.
Teacher Gao!
- The substitute is here.
- Where from?
From Wei village,
called Wei Minzhi.
She's in the classroom.
I'm going.
Stay and eat.
No, I have to go.
Bye.
- How old are you?
- Thirteen.
Only thirteen?
Where did you graduate?
Primary school of the Wei village.
What did the mayor tell you?
He said your mother is dying
and you need to go home.
I'll substitute for a month.
We have students from first
to fourth grade, 28 in all.
You haven't been to high school.
How can you substitute?
No one else will come.
There's no one else?
I've been everywhere.
No one will come.
This is a remote village,
far from everything.
No one wants to come.
We had 40 students,
but 1 0 already quit.
She's too young to teach.
It's only a month.
You have to go.
What can I do?
This is the best you can do?
It's just a month.
Figure something else out.
Okay, how's this?
Don't go.
I will send her away.
But you have to go.
Tell me what you can do.
What can you do?
I can't hear you.
What can you do?
I can sing.
You can sing.
Sing something.
Go outside.
Close the door.
Go ahead.
Our country is like a garden
The lovely birds in our garden
Will praise our country
Songs--
Songs--
Songs to praise our leader Mao
Make the sky blue again
And lead us to success
You sing too softly,
and the first line was wrong.
Sing with me.
Our country is like a garden
Our country is like a garden
The flowers there are beautiful
The flowers there are beautiful
Practice this song...
and memorize the lines.
Then teach the students.
- What other songs do you know?
- None.
You can't sing one song all month.
What else can you do?
- Can you copy lessons?
- Yes.
Good.
Copy one chapter a day.
Write it clear.
And write it neatly.
After you finish,
let the students copy.
See that pole?
When the sun reaches that,
it's time to go home.
What if there is no sun?
If the weather turns,
you let them go early.
But if it rains really hard,
don't let them go.
After a hard rain,
that alley collects water.
You must see the students home.
If the students finish early?
Let them go outside to play.
Don't let them fight.
After they play,
have them copy lessons again.
Understand?
I will be gone for a month.
Excluding four Sundays.
How many days is that?
Twenty-six days.
You get one piece of chalk a day.
One for a chapter.
Copy the lesson.
Don't write too small.
They won't be able to see it.
It's bad for their eyes.
But don't write too big.
It wastes chalk.
You have one piece of chalk a day.
The words should be as big...
as a donkey's turd.
About that size.
We're a poor school,
not much chalk available.
Here's two.
Two pair. Three. Four.
Five. Six. Seven. Eight.
Nine. Ten pair.
- Is that enough?
- One more.
Still missing one?
Twenty-six in all.
Come in here.
This is the teacher's room.
Your work desk.
Do your work here.
You have books and ink.
You sleep here.
If the bed's too small...
extend it with the chair.
Let me introduce you.
Zhang Mingshan.
Zhang Mingshan
is the class monitor.
-Jiao Jie.
- Zhang Huike.
- Tian Xuewei.
- Ming Xinhong.
These three girls
sleep with you at night.
The two boys sleep outside.
You make meals in the kitchen.
You'll find food and a wok.
You eat together.
Teacher Gao.
What is it?
- What about my fifty yuan?
- What fifty yuan?
The mayor said
he would pay me fifty yuan.
Then ask him for it.
If he promised you fifty yuan,
then ask him for it.
- He told me to get it from you.
- Ask me for it?
I don't have money.
I haven't been paid in six months.
All we have is some chalk.
He told me to ask you for it.
Ask him then.
I've got no money.
- Do you pee at night?
- No.
Then sleep inside.
I'll sleep outside.
Do you know Wei Chunzhi?
- Why?
- No reason.
- Where is she going?
- Going for a run.
- At this hour?
- She doesn't want to wet the bed.
That's silly.
I don't wet the bed.
But it's true.
She runs more than 1 0 km a day.
Why don't we wet the bed?
After running,
she doesn't either.
We don't sweat
and we don't wet the bed.
That's how she thinks.
Stop.
Teacher Gao.
Let's get going.
- I'm still worried.
- What for?
It's only for a month.
Mr. Mayor!
Mr. Mayor!
Mr. Mayor!
Mr. Mayor!
Stop the car!
- Mr. Mayor.
- What is it?
What about my fifty yuan?
Teacher Gao said he doesn't have it.
You ran all that way for this?
I thought something bad happened!
You do your job,
we'll pay you fifty yuan.
Wei Minzhi,
you look after the students.
More than ten have already left.
I don't want to lose any more.
The mayor promised fifty yuan.
He'll make sure you get it.
If all the students are here
when I get back--
not one less--
you'll get an extra ten yuan.
Okay, but you have to pay me.
If the mayor doesn't,
I'll give it to you.
Wei Minzhi.
Why are you sitting here?
The students run amok,
and you just sit!
What about class?
You are supposed to teach!
No more nonsense.
It's time for school!
What time is it?
It's almost noon!
- Let's get started!
- We haven't raised the flag.
Today is Monday.
We should raise the flag.
Raise the flag.
Raise the flag!
One, two, one.
One, two, one.
One, two, one.
One, two, one.
- Stand up straight.
- Turn left!
- Stand straight!
- Turn right!
Raise the flag!
- Sing the national anthem.
- Wait!
There is no flag.
How can you sing?
Zhang Huike, where is the flag?
- Teacher Gao has it.
- Teacher Gao is away.
- But--
- Go get it.
How can you sing without the flag!
Raise the flag and sing the anthem.
Ready, begin!
" Rise up! We are no man's slave.
Together we will
build a new Great Wall.
In times of danger,
the Chinese people...
will fight to their last breath.
Rise up! Together we have one goal.
We brave the enemy's bullets
and march ahead.
We brave the enemy's bullets
and march ahead.
And march ahead."
Be quiet!
Teacher Wei, come in.
Come in.
You are the teacher!
Come here!
Get in here.
Teacher Gao's mother is sick.
Very ill.
He is taking a month off.
I have found a substitute.
Her name is Wei, Wei Minzhi.
We will call her Teacher Wei.
Say Teacher Wei.
Hello, Teacher Wei.
- I can't hear you!
- Hello, Teacher Wei!
She's not a teacher.
She's Wei Chunzhi's sister.
- What?
- She's not a teacher.
- She is Wei Chunzhi's sister!
- Who is Wei Chunzhi?
She lives near my aunt!
So what?
If I say she's your teacher, she is!
No, she is not a teacher.
Farthead.
Call her teacher!
- Do it!
- No.
Come here!
You are asking for it! Come here!
- Call her teacher!
- Teacher Wei.
- I can't hear you!
- Teacher Wei!
No more nonsense!
Pay attention and study hard!
Especially you, Zhang Huike!
No trouble from you!
If you cause any more problems,
you'll get it from me!
Why is this table broken?
What about the money
I gave Teacher Gao?
- He used it to buy chalk.
- He bought chalk.
Well, never mind.
Start class.
- Copy the lesson.
- We don't know this.
We can't.
Teacher Gao said you have to.
We haven't learned this.
No one is leaving this room.
What are you doing?
- I'm going home.
- Why aren't you doing the lesson?
I can't.
I don't care.
I can't do it.
Go on and work.
No one leaves till the sun gets there.
Those are Teacher Gao's orders.
What do you want?
Go back inside.
Zhang Huike is making trouble.
Why don't you do something?
You are the teacher.
You should do something.
I can't do anything.
But you are the teacher.
There is nothing I can do.
Why are you out here?
Go back inside! Do your copying!
Zhang Huike is bothering me.
Do something.
I told you, there is nothing I can do.
You do something about it.
I am a student.
I can't do anything.
But you are the teacher.
It's up to you.
He is the king of troublemakers.
I can't stop him.
But you're the teacher--
Who knocked the desk over?
Who did this?
Zhang Huike!
- I did not!
- Did too!
It wasn't me!
You were playing around.
I heard a noise.
He knocked over the chalk.
It wasn't me!
He was chasing me!
He kicked my leg.
He pushed me!
I didn't push you!
- He did!
- I did not!
- Come clean up the mess!
- I didn't do it!
If you didn't, who did?
- No!
- You have to!
- Are you going to come here?
- No!
You are stepping on the chalk!
- I didn't do it.
- Pick it up. Get up!
Come here.
I didn't do it.
Don't crush the chalk!
Stop stepping on it!
Zhang Mingshan, write me a name list.
I'll take roll call tomorrow.
Did you hear me?
Why aren't you writing?
I told you to write a list!
So write!
When Teacher Gao comes back,
I am going to tell him.
- Tian Xuewei.
- Here.
- Li Lingyu.
- Here!
- Sun Zhiwei.
- Here!
- Li Shujun.
- Here!
- Li Zhanqiang.
- Here.
Speak louder.
Here!
Li Meiying.
- Li Meiying.
- Here!
Wang Chunfei.
Here.
Copy the lesson!
No one leaves until I say so.
What are you doing?
Go back in and do your work!
Stop!
Go back inside!
Come back!
- I need to pee!
- No!
- I really have to go!
- No way. You're lying!
I really have to pee!
I can't hold it.
Hurry!
I can't pee with you watching.
Go back and do your work.
Go! Back inside!
Go on and do your work!
Copy the lesson!
No one can leave!
Time for the music lesson.
Time for the music lesson.
I will sing
and you repeat after me.
Follow the steps.
Listen carefully.
Begin.
Our country is like a garden
Our country is like a garden
The beautiful flowers in the garden
The beautiful flowers in the garden
Let's sing a different song.
Called "The Red Sun."
Follow me!
This is--
Red sun, rainbow clouds
Red sun, rainbow clouds
I help mother wash our clothes
I help mother wash our clothes
Aile
Aile
Sing it again.
Red sun, rainbow clouds
I help mother wash our clothes
That's her.
Come here.
Her name is Ming Xinhong.
Ming Xinhong?
I hear you run very fast.
She runs over 1 0 km a day.
Really? I want you to show me.
You see that house over there?
I want you to run there and back.
You have to run fast!
On my count.
Ready, go.
Good, very good.
Tired?
- No.
- Good.
Ming Xinhong, Mr. Zhang wants you
to go to a city sports school.
- Are you willing?
- Yes, okay.
I will tell your parents tomorrow.
- And you can go.
- She can't leave!
- Why not?
- Not one less.
- Who said so?
- Teacher Gao.
This isn't up to him!
The sports school needs talent.
This is a good chance.
It might not come again!
No, she can't go.
This is my decision.
- Mr. Zhang, when does she leave?
- Tomorrow morning.
- We will be waiting.
- Should I talk to her parents?
- No need.
- Then I'll be going.
Can you take these students too?
They're also very fast.
No, just her.
Ming Xinhong.
Where is Ming Xinhong?
- I don't know.
- You don't know.
Is she in the classroom?
Where is she?
Not in the teacher's room.
- Wei Minzhi, where did Ming Xinhong go?
- I don't know.
She's your student!
I don't know.
You must have hidden her
somewhere, right?
- Then where is she?
- I don't know.
You are the teacher!
How can you not know?
- Where are the students?
- They're right here.
You're missing one.
- I don't know.
- How many students did you start with?
How many do you have now?
Go find her! They're here for her.
You can't hide her!
Go find her!
You hide her and
you say you don't know!
Why are you lying to me?
- I hired you to be the substitute.
- I don't know anything.
You better tell me!
I don't know.
If you don't find her,
I will fire you!
I won't help you!
Come back, you!
You better go find her!
I told you I don't know!
Why are you doing this?
Teacher Wei.
Where did you hide Ming Xinhong?
Can we go find her?
This is a good thing.
Don't you see?
You think that Teacher Gao
will blame you for this?
That's no problem.
Teacher Gao is my friend.
I'll explain it to him.
You don't have to worry.
When he finds out what happened,
he will be very pleased.
With the training
she will get...
she'll win honor for our school
and for our city.
Zhang Huike.
Where did your teacher
hide Ming Xinhong?
Tell me.
I don't know.
Are you sure?
No one can hear. Tell me.
Where is Ming Xinhong?
I know you know.
I don't know.
You don't know?
- Tell me!
- I don't know.
How can you not help me?
- Who do you listen to?
- My teacher.
- Who does the teacher listen to?
- You.
That's right.
Your teacher listens to me.
- So you have to listen to me also.
- Okay.
Where is she?
Buy me two blue pens,
then I will tell you.
- No problem.
- They have to be this long.
Okay. Tell me where she is.
Give me the money first.
Last time you didn't. I want the money.
- Last time I forgot.
- So pay me first.
Okay. So tell me.
Tell the truth.
Ming Xinhong.
You are going to the city.
Let's go.
Come on.
I can find someone else.
- I want to go.
- Then let's go.
Teacher Wei said to wait until
Teacher Gao comes back.
I already told him.
He said it's okay.
Mr. Zhang.
Mr. Zhang.
Let's go.
Where is she?
Stop!
Come back!
Come back!
Come back!
Stop the car, please!
She is a tough one.
I've never seen anyone like her.
She is really good.
Won't let them out of her sight.
It's not like it used to be.
Keeping kids in school
is harder than teaching them.
- Let's stop the car.
- No!
If we stop now
we'll never get away.
Mr. Zhang,
she runs pretty fast herself.
Give it here.
Give it to me.
What are you two doing?
Teacher Wei, she wrote
something bad about you!
I did not!
That's my diary.
She wrote something bad!
That's my diary.
Read it to me then.
Zhang Mingshan, let him read it!
- I won't let him read my diary!
- Who says?
I don't care if that
is your diary or not.
- Let him read!
- No!
Let him read it!
Read it!
"I feel very sad.
Two days ago, Zhang Huike--"
Hey, she wrote about me too.
"Zhang Huike was making trouble
and knocked down the desk.
A box of chalk fell on the floor.
Teacher Wei told him to pick it up,
but he refused.
Teacher Wei pushed him,
but Zhang Huike wouldn't listen.
Soon, most of the chalk
had been crushed on the floor.
Teacher Wei doesn't
treasure chalk like Teacher Gao.
Teacher Gao always tells us...
the school has no money.
We can't afford much chalk.
He teaches us to treasure the chalk.
I am the class monitor.
I help Teacher Gao pick up the chalk.
I know Teacher Gao
won't throw away...
even the smallest piece.
I remember once,
I tossed a small piece in the corner.
Teacher Gao saw it
and he picked it up.
He held it between
his fingertips...
and used it to write
one more word.
The last stroke...
he wrote with the chalk
left on his finger.
I feel very sad.
A whole box of white chalk...
became a box of black dust.
If Teacher Gao knew,
he would be sad, too."
Get up.
- What?
- I want to talk to you!
Can't we talk tomorrow?
I want to sleep.
Put on your clothes.
Hurry up!
What do you want?
Say you're sorry to Zhang Mingshan.
- Why?
- You knocked over the chalk.
You made so much trouble!
Why should I say I'm sorry?
I won't say it.
- You have to!
- I won't say it!
You have to!
I want to go back to bed.
You are not going anywhere
until you say sorry! Say it!
- No!
- Say it!
No!
You can stand here
the whole night!
- I'll pay you back.
- Using what?
- Money.
- How much do you have?
Here.
- Is that enough?
- How much is it?
- Fifty cents.
- How much chalk does that buy?
A box of chalk costs one Yuan.
- Twenty is enough.
- I am going back to sleep.
You stop causing trouble!
- Sun Zhiwei.
- Here.
- Sun Zhiwei.
- Here.
- Li Lingyu.
- Here!
- Tian Xuewei.
- Here.
- Li Jianmei.
- Here.
Zhang Huike.
Zhang Huike.
Where is he?
- His parents took him away.
- Wasn't he here this morning?
He just left.
I saw him.
- Where did he go?
- I don't know.
His family was looking for him.
They called him home.
Zhang Huike.
Is Zhang Huike at home?
Who is looking for him?
- Come in.
- I am his teacher.
- Isn't his teacher Mr. Gao?
- I am the substitute.
- Sit down.
- Where is Zhang Huike?
- He went to the city.
- By himself?
He went with kids
from the other village.
- Why did he go?
- To look for work.
He is so young.
What can he do?
Have some tea.
What can we do?
Look at our situation.
We owe so much money.
He has to help pay our debts.
- He can't go to school?
- No.
Where is he in the city?
Don't bother looking.
He won't be back.
His family problems are serious.
His dad died young.
His mother is sick.
They owe people money.
If he doesn't work,
they'll never pay their debt.
What can I do?
You have to go find him.
Even if I find him,
he won't come back.
Ming Xinhong left.
Now Zhang Huike is gone.
Two students gone.
What will I tell Teacher Gao?
You can't compare the two.
Zhang Huike needs money.
Ming Xinhong was recruited
for her talent.
That is a good thing.
Even if you find Zhang,
he won't come back. He can't.
Our village can't help him.
If we had money to give him,
he would come back.
But you have to find him.
If you don't go, I will.
He's no use.
He won't come back.
Can you get a truck to take me?
All the trucks are being used!
- Then give me some money for the bus.
- I don't have any money.
You owe me fifty yuan.
Give it to me now.
I can't give it to you now.
I will pay you later.
- But I have to find him.
- He still won't come back.
Besides, you are too young.
You can't go to the city alone.
I won't allow it.
You must teach our students.
I can't let you go.
Who will teach the students?
I'll come right back.
You teach them one day.
How can I do that?
I am the mayor. I'm very busy.
I don't have time to teach.
You can't go.
- I have to go.
- No.
- Give me money.
- Haven't got any.
How much are
bus tickets to the city?
How much are
bus tickets to the city?
- Ten yuan.
- One Yuan.
How much?
- One Yuan?
- No way.
How much?
Five and a half.
A child's ticket is one Yuan.
I don't know about an adult ticket.
The adult ticket
costs three Yuan.
Really? Three Yuan?
How do you know?
I went with my mother once.
Let's say three Yuan.
Round trip is six Yuan.
Plus Zhang Huike's ticket,
is twelve Yuan.
No, that's wrong.
He only needs return fare.
Nine Yuan total.
Who has money?
We don't have any.
I will pay you all back.
Come on.
We only need nine Yuan.
Everyone gives a little.
Let's see what you have.
I don't have any.
Take everything out.
Money.
Here.
Give it to me.
This is not enough.
Everyone puts in fifty cents.
- We have twenty-eight students.
- There are only twenty-six students.
Zhang Huike and
Ming Xinhong are not here.
Right, only twenty-six.
If everyone puts in fifty cents.
That's twenty-six times fifty cents.
- How much is that?
- 1 30 yuan.
1 30? Fifty cents from everyone?
No, that's wrong.
1 3 yuan.
That's enough.
I only need 9.
Everyone brings 50 cents tomorrow.
Understand?
We don't have it.
That won't do.
How can I get to the city?
How can I bring Zhang Huike back?
- No money.
- Bring your money tomorrow.
We could move bricks
at the factory.
- Move what?
- Move bricks to earn money.
- How much can we make?
- 1 .5 cents for each brick.
The factory's there.
My family worked there before.
One and a half cents.
That's not much.
So we'll move more.
How much would we have to move?
Zhang Mingshan,
come calculate on the blackboard.
One brick makes 1 .5 cents.
Ten makes 1 5 cents.
Moving 1 00 makes 1 50 cents.
Moving 1 000 makes 1 500 cents.
How much is 1 500 cents?
1 5 yuan.
1 5 yuan.
No, that's not right.
It should be 1 50 yuan.
1 5 yuan.
You added an extra zero.
It's 1 5 yuan then.
1 5 yuan, that's enough.
- Let's go to the factory now.
- Okay!
- Let's all go.
- Okay!
- Why is no one here?
- The power is out.
- Where is the director?
- He is not here.
Teacher, the boss is not here.
Let's go back.
We can't go back.
We will move the bricks first.
- He can pay us when we're done.
- What happens if he won't pay?
He will pay us if we work.
Let's go.
- Where do we put the bricks?
- How about here?
What if we don't know how?
Put one on top of another.
Once we're done, he has to pay us.
What are you doing?
Who let you in?
You have to pay us.
- Who let you in?
- We moved 1 000 bricks.
I should be charging you
for damage.
We moved 1 000 bricks.
You have to pay us!
- Pay you!
- We moved them inside!
You broke most of them.
Who told you to do this?
You have to pay us!
I won't give you a penny!
Pay me!
- We don't work for free!
- Leave!
Leave now!
- Pay us!
- Leave!
- Like a bunch of cackling birds.
- You have to pay.
Pay you for what?
For helping you
to move the bricks!
You broke most of them.
Why do you need money?
Zhang Huike went to the city.
She needs the bus fare
to bring him back.
One at a time.
What happened?
Zhang Huike went to the city.
I have to find him.
We have to help our classmate.
- What school are you from?
- Shuixian primary school.
- Your teacher is Mr. Gao, right?
- Yes.
- How much do you want?
- We already figured!
1 000 bricks is worth 1 5 yuan.
We moved 1 500 bricks.
- So you owe us 22 yuan.
- You're better at this than me!
I pack 1 0,000 bricks
and only get 40 yuan!
You move a thousand
and you want 20 yuan!
What is one fourth of forty yuan?
You have to pay us!
Out of respect for Teacher Gao...
and since you're
helping a classmate...
I will give you 5 yuan.
That's a lot.
It's not enough.
How much do you want?
You kids worked hard,
but you broke most of the bricks.
I have to pack them over again.
We should just call it even.
But we moved the bricks.
You have to pay.
Okay, because of Teacher Gao,
and since you're helping a classmate.
I'll give you 1 5 yuan.
It's more like a donation
to support your efforts.
Call me a philanthropist.
Teacher, I'm thirsty.
Let's get something to drink.
I'm thirsty too.
We have 1 5 yuan. Minus the 9 yuan
for bus tickets, we have 6 yuan left.
- Let's buy soda, okay?
- Okay!
- Here's the soda!
- Don't push!
What should we buy?
- Sports drink?
- Coca Cola!
What's it going to be?
Coke tastes good.
Never had it before.
How much for a Coke?
Everything is 3 yuan.
We have six Yuan.
We can only buy two cans.
- It's not enough for everyone.
- Everyone gets a taste.
Two cans then.
- Let me open it.
- You don't know how.
Let me have some.
- Let me.
- My lips are numb.
It's strange.
Let the teacher have some.
Li Meiying.
Teacher, the ticket is not 3 yuan.
- It's 20.5 yuan.
- It's 20.5 yuan.
It was 3 yuan.
I remember it was 3 yuan.
How much is a bus ticket
to the city?
Look at the price board.
- Isn't it 3 yuan?
- There is no 3 yuan ticket.
What about before?
We have never had
a 3 yuan ticket.
Go look for yourself.
Go look again.
A bus ticket is 20.5 yuan.
A bus ticket is 20.5 yuan.
How much do I need?
We have nine Yuan.
Who knows how much more we need?
Raise your hand.
I know.
- Can you calculate it?
- No.
Put your hand down then.
Dong Dong, come here.
That character is wrong!
You're missing a stroke.
It's "price," not "prince."
Let's calculate.
A bus ticket costs 20.5 yuan.
Multiply this by three.
Equals 61 .5 yuan.
We still need 52.5.
The man at the factory told us...
by moving 1 0,000 bricks,
we make 40 yuan.
We need 52.5.
How many bricks
do we have to move?
- Raise your hand.
- Let me do it.
Jiao Jie, you do it.
You got it wrong.
250.
Check it again.
It should be 250 yuan,
not 2.5 yuan.
You missed the decimal point.
It's done.
Moving 1 0,000 bricks
earns 40 yuan.
52 bricks times 1 0,000
divided by 40.
That substitute is not bad.
She can teach mathematics, too.
1 30,000 bricks?
That many?
Sure there isn't an extra zero?
We can't move that much.
Last time was already hard!
Let's calculate the time.
Yesterday we moved 1 500 bricks...
and it took us 2 hours.
If we move 1 30,000...
how much time do we need?
- I know!
- Come on up.
Zhang Mingshan, you calculate.
Two hours to move 1500 bricks.
How long do we need?
1 75 hours.
That's too much!
If we work eight hours a day...
how many days must we work?
Twenty-one days.
- Twenty-one days and seven hours.
- Twenty-two days.
You made a mistake.
- I made a mistake.
- Where?
I added an extra zero.
Jie, you added
an extra zero again!
We only need 1 7 hours.
That is two days.
That's good.
Then let's go.
We can't do it!
It'll take too long!
We can't do it!
But I have to go to the city...
to bring him back.
Are we going or not?
Let's forget the bricks.
You should just sneak onto the bus.
It would take forever
to earn the money.
What if I get caught?
No way!
We'll go with you.
What are you kids doing?
Get back!
Why aren't you in school?
Where are the other two?
Are you trying to pull something?
- Can't we buy tickets, too?
- Get off the bus!
Bus to the city!
Last call!
Any more passengers?
Bus to the city!
Last call!
Get off!.
No free rides!
Can you tell me where this is?
1 6, Yu Dao Temple.
Oh, Wu-Dao Temple.
- Is Zhang Huike here?
- Who?
I don't know.
Is Zhang Huike here?
- I don't know.
- Zhang Huike!
Zhang Huike!
- Who is looking for Zhang Huike?
- Me.
- Where are you from?
- From Shuixian Village.
Talk to Sun Zhimei.
Sun Zhimei,
someone is looking for you.
Who is looking for me?
Where is Zhang Huike?
- He's not here.
- Where is he?
We lost him at the train station.
You lost him! How?
He went to the bathroom
and never returned.
- Didn't he come to work?
- Who are you?
I am his teacher.
Who did he come with?
- Me.
- Then how could you lose him?
He said he wanted to pee.
He didn't come back.
I waited a long time.
- Did you look for him?
- Of course!
- Did you tell his family?
- I will when I get back.
- He wanted to come.
- You have to help me look for him.
I have to work.
I can make 2 yuan a day.
You have to help find him.
He wandered off!.
It's not my fault.
- You have to help.
- Give me 2 yuan.
- Why should l?
- If I go you have to pay.
I make 2 yuan a day!
Come with me.
Pay me and I'll go with you.
- No, come with me first.
- You don't pay, I won't go.
Come to the train station,
then I will pay you.
Then it's 2.5 yuan.
You said 2 yuan!
Why is it 2.5 now?
If you pay me now, it's 2 yuan.
At the station it's 2.5.
2.5?
Then let's go.
- Do you have money?
- Of course.
Let me see it.
Look, I have money.
Let's go.
Can't you go any faster?
Hurry!
- Where is it?
- The train station is there.
We're almost there.
- Why did you stop?
- I'm hungry.
- No, come on.
- I didn't get any breakfast.
We have to find him first.
- Let me eat.
- No.
It was here.
How will we find him?
Over there.
That red sign.
This sign?
Right here.
We got off the train.
I sat here waiting for him.
He went to pee.
I waited.
He never came back.
How come?
I don't know.
I didn't follow him to the bathroom.
- I did go look for him.
- Where did he go?
I told you I don't know.
He went to the bathroom!
I wish he'd told me.
Did you really look for him?
- I left a message over there, too.
- What message?
Where?
Where is your message?
I wrote it.
I put it here.
Did you really write it?
I picked up a box
and wrote the message on the back.
- Then I glued it there.
- What did you write?
My name and address.
Could he read your writing?
Why wouldn't he?
I wrote in big letters.
How can we find him in this crowd?
Listen!
Let's page him.
We'll make an announcement.
Like a megaphone. In our village,
the medicine hawker uses one.
Will that work?
Yes. It's the only way.
This is the place.
- Is it here?
- Don't you see the sign?
Knock on the door.
What is it?
We lost someone.
Can you--
Make an announcement?
Who are you looking for?
My student Zhang Huike.
He came to the city to work.
One student.
A boy or a girl?
A boy. His family is poor.
He came to work.
What does he look like?
How tall? What's he wearing?
This tall.
He wore a checkered shirt.
- It was gray.
- Hold on.
Write it all down.
- Have you finished?
- Yes.
"Zhang Huike, male, eleven years old.
From Shuixian Village.
Third grade student.
Wearing a checkered shirt
and light gray pants.
Not very tall, short hair,
medium build.
His family is poor, and his mother
is sick, and his dad died young.
He left school."
All of this is useless.
Where can he find you?
How can he find you?
You two go over there.
Go stand by the stairs and wait.
- I'll tell him to look for you there.
- Which stairs?
Right there. Go there and wait.
Don't wander around.
Otherwise, he can't find you.
- Only one?
- One for me, one for you.
- No more?
- I only got two.
Let's eat.
Attention, please.
Zhang Huike from Shuixian Village.
It's the announcement. Listen.
It's the announcement.
On the loudspeaker.
Zhang Huike from Shuixian Village.
When you hear this message,
go to the stairs at Building 11.
Your teacher is waiting for you.
They made the announcement.
I came with you.
Pay me. I have to go.
- No. I won't pay.
- Why not?
We have to find him first.
You think I'm going
to follow you my whole life?
I've followed you all day.
I came to the train station.
We made an announcement.
He'll show up soon.
- Now pay me.
- No, not until I find him.
- Get up, get me the money.
- I am not paying.
They announced it.
He'll be here.
If you won't pay me...
I'll take it from you.
No!
You promised me.
Pay me.
You promised me.
Hurry up!
2.5 yuan.
- That's not enough!
- Here.
Enough!
You go on waiting.
I'm leaving.
You're still here?
Haven't you found him yet?
He didn't come.
Can you announce it again?
I announced it six times already.
I shouldn't have made that many.
- Where did you lose him? Here?
- Yes.
- When?
- Two, three days ago.
That long?
Then it was useless.
You better think
of something else.
- Please, a couple more times.
- It's no use.
What do you want to buy?
A pen and ink.
What for?
You look like you're
from the countryside.
My student came to the city.
I need to write a message
to find him.
You want to write a notice.
The cheapest pen is 1 .5 yuan.
- How much do you have?
- 6.5 yuan.
Only 6.5 yuan.
Want to spend it all?
You will also need ink.
That's 1 yuan.
The total is 2.5 yuan.
1 00 sheets of paper is 4 yuan.
That's exactly 6.5 yuan.
" Lost, Zhang Huike.
Male, eleven years old,
third grade.
Came to the city three days ago.
If you have information,
contact the Shuixian Village school."
There's no address, telephone number,
pager number, mobile phone.
How can they contact you?
Even if they want to help,
how can they?
Where is Shuixian Village?
Which county? Which district?
People are too lazy
to pick up the phone.
Who has time to write?
No one will write to you,
even if they know something.
The writing is too light.
Who can read that?
Even 500 pieces,
even with a picture.
Your chances are slim.
It's a waste of time.
What?
You say it won't work.
What should I do?
Do whatever you like.
- Tell me what to do.
- How annoying!
You can go to the police.
File a report and they'll look for him.
No, that won't work either.
They're too busy.
Put an ad in the paper?
But it will be very small.
No one will see it.
Hey, I know.
Go to the TV station.
Once you are on TV,
the whole city will know.
That's the best way to go.
Where is the station?
Take the No. 5 bus.
How do I go on foot?
It's very far.
I am not sure.
Go outside and ask someone.
- Where is the TV station?
- Where?
- The television station.
- That way.
Where's the television station?
That way.
Where's the television station?
Where are you going?
- To look for someone.
- You can't come in yet.
The station's not open.
You can't just waltz in!
What are you doing?
- I'm looking for someone.
- Who?
Someone said I could find
someone here.
There are a lot of people here.
Who are you looking for?
I am a substitute
from Shuixian primary school.
My student's family is so poor,
he had to leave school.
I don't want to hear this.
Sign in.
I really am looking for someone.
Look.
" Lost..." What a long message.
You did this yourself?
Why don't you post it?
They said it won't work.
The TV station is better.
Right, ads on TV get better results.
It's useless to post anything.
No one will read it.
I never do.
Can you show me some I.D.?
Go to the ad department.
I don't have I.D.
- An introduction letter?
- No.
- A letter from your village?
- No.
- A letter from your school?
- No.
- Your student I.D. then.
- I don't have one.
No student I.D.?
How can I trust you?
You could be anybody.
You say you are a teacher
from the mountains.
How can you prove that?
How can I let you in
without any I.D.?
Please let me in.
- Please let me in to see.
- No.
- Let me in.
- Listen to me.
You want to go to
the ad department.
No problem.
But with no I.D.
or recommendation letter...
how can I let you in?
We have rules.
I can't just let you in.
You understand?
- Zhang Huike is lost--
- What's that got to do with me?
Why won't you listen?
The two people before?
They had I.D.
So I let them in.
If something happens,
it's me they'll blame.
Please let me in.
No!
Don't wait here anymore.
It's no use.
- Go on, leave.
- No.
What a pest.
Please let me in.
I've already explained.
Now just go!
Do you have money?
You know the price of an ad?
- Do you have money?
- No.
You don't have a cent?
What's the point of letting you in?
You are a joke.
Even if I let you in,
it wouldn't do you any good.
- Leave now.
- What should I do?
What should you do?
Unless you're related
to the station manager.
- Only he can help.
- How do I find him?
Third floor. He wears glasses.
Go on.
See if the guard lets you in.
I'll go then.
- What are you doing?
- I am looking for the station manager.
You need a note
from the front desk.
Did you hear me?
Can you tell him to let me in?
I already told you.
It's his decision.
You don't have any I.D.
You just don't listen.
Don't you have a phone here?
Can you call the station manager?
You think it's that simple?
You think I'd bother him with this?
Go away.
Stop causing trouble.
- Has today's paper arrived?
- Not yet.
- This is yesterday's.
- Call when you get it?
Okay.
Go, leave.
I want to wait
for the station manager.
You want to wait? Here?
Let's see how long you can wait.
Go outside and wait.
Stand outside the gate.
You can wait
as long as you like.
If you don't leave now,
I'll call security.
We are very busy.
I have to check people all day.
Go, leave.
Are you the station manager?
Are you the station manager?
- What?
- Are you the station manager?
Station manager?
Are you the station manager?
What? Station manager?
Are you the station manager?
Are you the station manager?
Station manager? No.
Are you the station manager?
Are you the station manager?
No.
- Are you the station manager?
- Station manager?
What station manager? No.
You've made a mistake.
Come here, kid.
Come in.
Give him something to eat.
Are you hungry?
You can't bother the customers.
You will hurt my business.
If you are hungry, come in here.
After you eat
you can help me wash dishes.
Remember to stay away
from the customers.
Okay.
Hey, kid.
Wake up.
Why are you sleeping here?
You'll catch cold.
Are you okay?
Get up.
There's a young girl
been looking for you.
Asking everyone.
Been there a whole day.
She was there again this morning.
That one with the red shirt?
That's the one.
Go check it out.
She said she is a teacher,
looking for her student.
She wanted to place an ad.
But she has no I.D.
I hear she has been waiting
a day and a half.
She wanted to wait.
I just follow the rules.
What an attitude!
You let her wait
a day and a half.
Now you say she is crazy.
I think you're the crazy one.
I just follow the rules.
- She has no I.D.
- So you let her wait?
How could you?
- I will let her in right away.
- Forget it! I'll go.
- Are you the station manager?
- Yes.
Is there something I can do?
You don't want an ad.
30 seconds costs 600 yuan.
That's money you don't have.
But the station manager wants to help.
We have a plan.
We have a show called
"Today in China."
It's our highest rated show.
You'll be our guest
on education in the countryside.
We'll mention your student.
It's sure to work.
Education standards
have reached new levels.
Education standards
have reached new levels.
Knowledge has increased...
with the mandated
9 years of school.
But for some
it's more difficult.
Especially in the rural areas.
They don't have
the necessary tools.
And lots of children, for many reasons,
can't go to school.
Today, I am honored to introduce...
a special guest...
who will talk about
education in the countryside.
I have here Miss Wei from
Shuixian Village primary school.
Can you tell us about...
the situation at your school?
Miss Wei is a little nervous.
Zhang Huike is
a third grade student at Shuixian.
His mother is ill
and the family owes money.
He came to work
to pay their debt.
Teacher Wei came
to the city by herself...
to find Zhang Huike...
so he can go back to school.
More and more students
are leaving school.
Why do you think this happens?
Don't be nervous.
Their families are poor.
Why must you find Zhang Huike?
Why are you looking for him?
Zhang Huike's situation
is more and more common.
We hope that society
can give them a hand...
help them go back to school.
We need to help
the coming generations.
We know how you're feeling.
Can you say something
to our audience?
Maybe Zhang Huike
is out there watching you.
Look at the camera
and talk to him.
Look into the lens.
Imagine that Zhang Huike
is listening to you.
He must miss you very much.
Say something to him.
Zhang Huike...
where did you go?
I've looked everywhere.
I am so worried.
Why don't you come back?
- This is "Today in China."
- We haven't found him yet.
Do you have any information?
Yes? Tell us the time.
We are still looking for him.
Yesterday,
at the end of the street.
What was he wearing?
Come here.
Watch this.
Is that you?
You watch.
Look into the lens.
Imagine that Zhang Huike
is listening to you.
He must miss you very much.
Say something to him.
Zhang Huike...
where did you go?
I've looked everywhere.
I am so worried.
Zhang Huike, comeback.
We are almost there.
How do you feel...
about finding Zhang Huike?
I am very happy.
Zhang Huike...
do you think Miss Wei
is a good teacher?
- Yes.
- How will you repay her?
When I finish studying...
finish high school...
I will make a lot of money
and buy her lots of things.
Why?
She went through a lot.
I have to repay her.
What will you buy her?
Lots of good stuff.
- What good stuff?
- Pretty stuff.
What is good stuff?
Flowers.
- Do you like the city?
- Yes.
What is good about it?
The city is...
beautiful and prosperous.
Much better than the countryside.
What's the most lasting impression?
That I had to beg for food.
I will always remember that.
Teacher Wei brought
Zhang Huike back.
The whole village
is here to celebrate.
How are you feeling?
I am very happy.
I am happy Zhang Huike is back.
Did you know she went
looking for Zhang Huike?
I didn't know.
She said she wanted to go.
I said no,
so she went on her own.
I was very worried
that she wouldn't come back.
A lot of nice people
donated classroom materials.
What will you do with all this?
Give them to the students.
Let the students use them.
They should use them to learn.
There are so many kind people
who care about Zhang Huike...
and about the primary school,
so they donated money.
As the mayor...
what are you going
to do with this money?
With money,
we can do many good things.
This school is old.
- It leaks when it rains.
- How old is the school?
About 45 years old.
I want to build a new school.
So much chalk.
We don't have to buy any more.
We'll keep it for Teacher Gao.
He will be so happy!
Teacher Wei, such pretty chalk.
The words you write
will be very pretty.
Write something!
Let's save it for Teacher Gao.
Write something!
I want to write something too.
Everyone takes one piece of chalk
and can write a character.
But only one!
"Sky."
" Happiness."
"Water."
" Name."
" Diligence."
Li Meiying, you want to write one?
Come on.
Come here.
I can't write.
I can draw a flower.
Then draw one.
" Flower."
Teacher, can I write
more than one?
Go ahead.
"Teacher Wei."
" Home."
Zhang Huike returned to school.
With the donated money,
his family's debt was paid.
Ming Xinhong ran in the city track meet
and was placed first in the 5000 meters.
Wei Minzhi went back to her family's farm.
She often returns to visit her students.
The remaining money
went to rebuild the school.
They renamed it
the Shuixian School of Hope.
Each year, poverty forces more than
one million children in China to leave school.
Through the help of donations, about
15% of these children return to school.
