charlie,are you in there?
what? I'm in the shower.
- what?
- what?
- what?
- what?
ugh,damn it.
what the hell?I'm naked.
you better have a fistful
of singles or get out.
yeah,whatever.you couldn't hear me.
now don't look.I gotta pee.
there's two other
bathrooms in this house.
yeah,well,I'm in a hurry
and I've got to talk to you.
can you handle sam's
sleepover this weekend?
ah,man.I really wish I could.
I have big plans... which I'm desperately
trying to come up with even as we speak.
well,I have actual plans.
a guy invited me to palm springs
for the weekend to play golf.
you don't play golf.
he's a cosmetic dentist.he's
rich.I play golf.
No way.this is why we have a schedule.
okay.
I'm going to approach this differently.
that's one.
you're going to scald
me into a sleepover?
let's ask the toilet.
okay! Okay!damn you. I'll do it.
what the hell was that for?
that's for covering up the
tattoo of my name on your butt.
I didn't cover it.
I just added,"for a good
time,call" and your phone number.
I don't know who I thought was going to see
it,but it seemed like a funny idea at the time.

<font color=#70DBDB>ANGER
MANAGEMENT  Season 1Episode08</font>
I have a quick little topic I
would like to cover before we break.
somebody gave me a
negative review on yelp.
what the hell is yelp?
it's the sound you make
when you sit on your balls.
yes.it's also a site where anyone
can review anything anonymously.
the complaint was that I go off topic.
now,I'm not going to jump to  to any
conclusions or make a big deal about it.
so maybe you could
just tell me who did it.
I knew it was you!
Actually,it wasn't,but I do
think you're going off topic.
all right,forget the yelp thing.
I'm just going to let it go.
anybody have any last things
they would like to discuss?
I knew it was you!
no.
I'm a little nervous
about a date I got tonight.
oh,I'm sorry.
I didn't realize your
group was still in session.
I'll go wait in the kitchen.
that's all right,kate.we're almost done.
oh,yeah.we're all friends here.
come on,sit down next
to "texas thunder."
thanks.
I'm just going to grab some
coffee and ride out the storm.
anyway,I've been dating this girl
from work for about a month now--
You do know that accidentally walking next to
someone on the way to the bathroom isn't dating?
that is how we met,but now it's real.
tonight is our fourth date and
we're in that awkward phase...
right before she gets weirded
out and doesn't want a fifth date.
nolan,why so negative?
things don't have to work out that way.
have some confidence in
yourself.You're a great guy.
we're not taking opposing
views yet,patrick.
I just wish I was
better at liking myself.
that's one of the
things I hate about me.
I really just want this one to work out.
I mean,athena,she's different
than the girls I usually date.
when you say different,you mean... no
angry voice mails,no drunken tirades,
no stealing your car and using
it in a liquor store robbery?
yeah.
debbie was great,but athena
is different than that.
and she's a gentle lover in bed.
that's right.we did it.
sick.
if for some reason you
make it to a fifth date,
I would love to meet this "woman"
and see if she actually exists.
yeah.Untie her from the
radiator and bring her in.
no. I haven't told her
I'm in anger therapy yet.
I wouldn't really be comfortable
introducing her to the group.
oh,we'll be nice.
we'll just put her up here on the
table,turn her around a couple of times,
see if she's a good breeding filly.
because I believe that's the nicest
thing that is going to happen to her here,
I'm going to nip this in the bud.
nolan,I think you should
focus on your date tonight.
where are you taking her?
well,there's a discount sushi truck
I've been trying to catch up with.
or else just the merry
peasant for drinks.
I'd go with the peasant.
I me,unless you're going to propose,then
definitely go with the poison sushi.
you're not really
going to do that,right?
do what?
Show up to the bar to help nolan
get to the fifth date with that girl.
What are you talking about?
Oh,please,charlie.
why else would you ask him
where he's going on his date?
it's for a research paper.
"places patients go on dates.
" it's a follow-up to my earlier
work,"bipolar's guide to amusement parks.
" you're overly involved in your
patients' lives and it's a big problem.
Look,I'm just gonna pretend i'm an old buddy
and chat the guy up in front of his date.
Tell her he's
solid,dependable,charismatic.
I happen to be a very
persuasive,you know... Liar.
charlie,you have a distant
mother and a critical father,
and that is why you have an overwhelming
need to be loved by everyone...
including your patients.
or I just want to help my
patients have a healthier life.
I guess you don't.
my god,how do you look
at yourself in the mirror?
except for the fact that
you're very,very pretty.
I was thinking,maybe we could go to
the renaissance faire this weekend.
are you free?
yeah.that would be our
fifth date,methinks.
but thy would have to drive.
as my car needeth a new belt of timing.
hey,nolan.
charlie. what are you doing here?
I just stopped by for a drink.
hi,I'm charlie.
this is athena.athena,this is charlie.
hi,charlie.
I don't want to bother you two.
looks like you're having fun.
obviously,everybody has fun with nolan.
solid,dependable,charismatic nolan.
we have a great time
whenever we're hanging out.
how do you guys know each other?
charlie's my,eh... urologist.
really?
you're his penis doctor?
yes. because that's
what an urologist is.
So my penis is fine,right?
it's delightful.
excuse me.
There's a guy at the bar who's really lit,and
he's pissed because I had to cut him off.
I think I need your professional skills.
oh,my god.is something
wrong with his penis?
I'm off the clock,brett.
Maybe you should call the
cops so they'll handle it.
no. You're an anger management
therapist and you're right here.
Wait. Is that how you know him?
Were you just lying to me?
Are you in anger therapy?
well,maybe.-
kind of.- Yeah.
I'm just going to handle this myself.
I can't believe this.
athena,it's not what you think.
it is exactly what I think.
someone lied to me,right to my face.
Don't call me.Don't
come over.We're done.
ok. Before you say anything,let
me just say... dinner's on me.
Whatever plans you
have today,break them.
that's a problem because my plan
today was to break all my plans.
now I'm confused.
here.
what are these?
spaces available for your new office.
why?are they bulldozing my living room
and putting in a new shopping mall?
You know how you're not supposed to work
in your bed because it's where you sleep?
I don't know if I agree.I think
I do some of my best work in bed.
Yes,you do.
You show up whenever you're supposed
to and you keep a tidy work space
and you've gone 110
days without an accident.
my point is,having patients in your home
makes you feel like they're your family.
that just encourages you to
get overinvolved in their lives.
will you stop worrying about that?
I'm telling you,it's
not a problem for me.
It is.
You almost went to the bar last night to
make sure your patient had a good date.
I didn't almost go to the bar.
- so you went to the bar?
- yes.
- and it went badly?
- no.
- it went horribly?
- yes.
that's nolan and athena.
I'm going to help
them get back together.
You are in complete denial.
Well,maybe,but it's
better than partial denial.
that's so wishy-washy.I
say go big or go home.
I'm so sorry. I
overreacted. I do that a lot.
that's okay.
most people think you have to
be angry to be in anger therapy,
but there are lots of other
related issues.like nolan's.
You can't lump people together.
Not all the vikings raped and pillaged.
Some of them just liked sailing.
you know what,nolan?those rape analogies
don't always work,but that one is on the money.
I just want you to know that
I'm here for you on your journey.
our journey.
I feel so much better.
Now I don't have to hide anything.
Thank you,charlie.
I love you,man.
I may get a little emotional.
I'll be right back.
are we done?
eh,as soon as nolan gets
back from the bathroom.
- I guess you can go.
- really?
Thanks.
did I say something wrong?
no,you're a therapist.you're god.
Well,we better go.
If we leave now,we can still
make the renaissance faire.
Thanks again for taking the time
to explain everything to me so
that nolan and I could
get back together.
I won't forget this.
do you blink?
I don't think you blink.
I don't want to miss anything.
See ya.
hey,nolan.
Sent you a couple of emails,didn't hear
anything back.Is everything all right?
yeah.
I was over at athena's and I went
to the bathroom,and when I came back,
my computer was smashed on the floor.
athena said her cat did it.
her cat?
yeah.I mean,her cat is real crazy.
I guess he was playing with my phone and
erased all my old girlfriends' numbers.
nolan,I've never had a cat,so
maybe I'm alarmed for nothing.
It sounds like you,me,and athena
need to have another session.
not necessary.
I actually want to talk
about athena in group today.
That's very healthy.Let's get started.
- okay.
- wait. Where's ed?
turns out he was the one who
complained about me on yelp.
Apparently,he also complained
about the patriot act.
so now he's down at the federal building
trying to prove he's not a honduran national.
now,I think nolan has
something he'd like to share.
thanks,charlie.
I'm leaving the group.
bye,everybody.
okay,cool.My turn.
hold on.Hold on,patrick.
what do you mean you're leaviea,nolan?
well,last night,athena was explaing to me
how inappropriate it is for my therapist
to be meddling in a
patient's personal life.
she really knows because she's
been in therapy a bunch of times.
I mean,a lot.
what was she in therapy for?
She said it's very complicated and that records were
burned in an unexplained fire in her foster home.
it's weird,huh?
here's the good news.
we're moving in together.
bye,everybody.
at the risk of being too
involved in your personal life,
do you really feel you know her
well enough to move in with her?
Athena said you would
say the exact same thing.
She's pretty much
right about everything.
She said I don't need to go to therapy
anymore because she can tell me what to do.
nolan,from what I'm hearing,we
need to keep talking.
this is a terrible time for you
to leave therapy,but this is group.
why don't we hear what
the group has to say?
Okay. I'll go first.
nolan,there are so many issues,I
don't even know where to start.
one. I'm amazed you even know
how to get here by yourself.
two. Who would want you with that hair?
three. Think with your
head,not with your wiener.
four. Who would want
you with that shirt?
- five.
- all right,lacey.
but you did say something
in there that made sense.
- the wiener thing?
- yes.
I knew it.
nolan,I think your feelings for
athena may be clouding your judgment.
she didn't push me into anything.
she said to take my time
and really think about it.
that's athena.
She misses me.
I gotta go get her stuff from her
ex-boyfriend's place while he's still at work.
you've got to help him,charlie.
it's like watching a baby possum
crossing the road at night.
I've hit so many.
I can't watch another one die.
well,then you might want to rinse off
your bumper 'cause here comes a big one.
hey,charlie.
I felt bad about bailing on you this weekend,so
I brought over some snacks for the sleepover.
Thanks.I uld have done it myself,but
I got a lot of crap going on.
Condomnd am I expected to provide
sex partners for all these girls?
those are mine.
strawberry-flavored?
Your rich cosmetic dentist is not
going to like the shear in these.
charlie!
you know four out of five dentists recommend
sugarless condoms for their patients who chew condoms.
don't give me crap about
going away with this guy.
I already feel bad enough
missing sam's sleepover.
tell me about guilt.
I tried to help a patient with
his girlfriend and I broke them up.
then I get them back together
and it turns out she's unstable.
you know,this feels
really nice,like old times.
Talking about your problems,and if I wasn't
on my way to screw some guy in palm desert,
I would so stay and
help you work it out.
I understand.
you have to trap a man into loving you.
I get it.
thank you.
hey,how's it going?
they're texting about how lame this is.
how do you know?
they're texting me.
Is there anything I can do to help?
how about some pictionary?
no,no.fun stuff is supposed
to happen spontaneously.
oh,my god,look.
it's pictionary for no reason.
katelyn with a k wants you to
leave because you're annoying.
and caitlyn with a c says
you're not annoying,just boring.
I think I know why
she spells it with a c.
hello?
Nolan,how are you?
are you okay?
pretty good.
I'm at the sun valley
battered women's shelter.
you're what?!
it was the nearest
place they could take me.
turns out athena has anger issues.
could have used a heads-up on that.
I am so sorry,nolan.
where's athena now?
she took off.
The police are looking for her.
can you please pick me up?
be kind of hard for me right now,and I'm
not sure it would be appropriate,nolan.
isn't there anybody else you can call?
I tried lacey,but she didn't pick up.
is there anybody you can call
that actually cares about you?
that's why I called you.
look,I can't go back to my house.
I gave a key to athena.
it's kind of ironic because
she stuck it in my eye.
- look,nolan-- I
need a ride quick!
they're not exactly pro-dude here.
of course I'll be there.
you just hang tight at
the shelter.I'm on my way.
what the hell is going on?
why is somebody at a shelter?
and why is there no pizza?
I thought this was a sleepover.
One of my patients got
beat up by his girlfriend.
Look,I'm in a bind here.
- I need you to do me a favor
and watch the girls-- no.
I can't bring all these girls
to a battered women's shelter.
Their parents will crucify me.
But you can leave them with the
beer-drinking neighbor who had a pot brownie
about an hour ago and is
still feeling pretty good?
okay,cheech.
just hang here and help yourself
to anything in the fridge.
there's egg salad and
leftover sloppy joes.
Awesome.
I'm going to make myself an eggy joe.
would you guys mind if I left for
about an hour to run an errand?
I don't know.I don't trust
myself with liquor in the house.
okay. Who wants to
go to in-n-out burger?
i want to go.
eat your eggy joe.
all right.On the way back,I have
to make a quick stop all I ask is
that you don't tell your
parents about this little detour.
are we going on a drug run?
no.We're not going on a drug run.
i want to go.
I said we're not going on a drug
run!eat your goddamn eggy joe!
**
what happened to your face?
I'll awer that,nolan.
he had an accident
giving his cat a bath.
Yeah,whiskers can be pretty
ferocious when she's been drinking.
why were you at a women's shelter?
okay.
I think it's time to tell them the
truth about what really happened to you.
nolan is a reporter for "time
magazine"... doing an expos?
On what it's like to be a man
living in a women's shelter.
then he walked into a door.
You must be a pretty crappy therapist if you
don't know domestic abuse when you see it.
ruby's right.
nolan is a victim of domestic abuse.
I'm really sorry everybody
had to be involved in this.
It's all my fault.
I should have known... You don't unload
a dishwasher while someone's on the phone.
check it out.
your daughter and her
friends did some makeup on me.
turns out I have combination skin.
lacey.What are you doing here?
you texted me.
oh,you mean,why do I care?
you know,charlie's always saying we
should give a crap about each other.
I'm touched,lacey.
yeah,well,I figured I'd try
it once to get you off my ass.
so where's the bitch that hit you?
I don't know.
she hasn't texted me back yet.
Wha-you texted her?
I didn't want her to worry.
dad,there's some woman outside
the house yelling for nolan.
I think she's drunk.
how do you know that?
she keeps yelling,"i'm drunk.
" Holy crap.All right.
Take all your friends upstairs.
Tell them there's $20 in it for every
kid who doesn't text their parents.
if they give you any lip,go to $30.
okay,okay.Just wait here.
I'm going to go out there and try and talk her down
before this thing gets any further out of control.
I got this.
lacey... lacey!
nolan,come outside.
I just want to talk to you!
Yeah,well,I want to talk to you,too!
Slow down.
nothing was ever solved by
hitting someone with a giant spoon.
I'm responsible for this.
I'm the one who has to
do something about it.
- get out here!
- You're right.
You should be doing something.
Here,hold my earrings.
Lacey.
You don't understand how mean she
is.She's drunk.She'll kill you.
Take the big fork,too.
lacey,sit down.
- baby,I just wanna see you!
-nolan,listen to me.
I get it now.
I don't care if you like
me or hate me anymore.
Watching you stand here,ready to let lacey
go out and fight for you with cutlery--
no matter how big--
is the last straw.
I have failed you as a therapist.
I'm going to go out
there,get rid of athena...
...then you're going to find a
new therapist who can help you.
nolan.
wait. Give me the spoon.
You're not going out
there.Charlie's not going out there.
I'm the only one going out there,and
I can only be stopped with a kiss.
I'm not going to kiss him.
charlie,are you?
I-I think it would
send the wrong message.
okay.
here I go.
baby,I miss you.
You're really going to
let him go out there alone?
you know what?
he really needs to do this.
see?
They're talking.
she's turning around.
walking to her car.
she's getting in.
now she's driving away.
now she's turning around...
now she's chasing nolan.
call the cops.I've got to go.
drop the spoon and run,man!
I'm not getting strawberry.
they're like otter pops.
they all taste the same.
So anyway,
lacey grabs a giant spoon to go
after athena,but nolan stopped her
and went outside and got chased
up a tree by a toyota 4runner.
This all happened in front of a
bunch of screaming little girls.
well,I think I know what
the giant spoon represents.
No,no,no.This wasn't a dream.
It actually happened.
so what was the final outcome?
Well,you were right and I was right.
I inspired lacey with my methods,but
I inspired nolan with yours.
But by using your
methods,I made them mine.
So it was a total victory for me.
good for you.
now,if you want another victory tonight,you're
going to have to give it to yourself.
here's bana.
