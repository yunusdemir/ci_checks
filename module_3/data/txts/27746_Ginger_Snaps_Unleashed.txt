<i>Out by 16 or dead
in the scene, but together forever.</i>
<i>Lie down!</i>
<i>Lie down!</i>
<i>Thought you were gonna die.</i>
<i>I'm changing--
full moons have nothing to do with it.</i>
<i>It's like an infection--
it works from the inside out.</i>
<i>It's like a virus.</i>
<i>Something is really,
really wrong with me.</i>
<i>I can't be like this.</i>
<i>This is monkshood.</i>
<i>I don't know if you smoke it
or eat it or what,</i>
<i>but I need to try it now.</i>
<i>Ginger!
Please, it's me--</i>
I'm onto you.
You come in here late at night,
you stay until all the other
avid readers are gone.
You're attracted to me,
but you fear rejection.
So you bide your time,
just kind of waiting
for that perfect moment.
Don't worry, I've been
dealing with this all my life.
I'm kidding.
Your fly's open.
Okay.
Perfect.
Yeah.
Yeah, I indulge in the occasional
bloodletting myself.
Okay.
Brigitte Fitzgerald.
Unfortunately you have
quite the overdue account.
And technically, if you have
more than $6 owing, I'm just--
Okay, well, I'll see you later.
<i>You're healing faster, aren't you?</i>
<i>That shit's not a cure, you know.
It just slows the transformation.</i>
<i>It doesn't stop it, B.</i>
<i>Nothing will stop it.</i>
<i>What are you doing?</i>
<i>You already dosed today.</i>
<i>It's poison, B.
You can't keep shooting it.</i>
<i>Remember that game we used to play
when we were little?</i>
<i>The one where we would</i>
<i>make ourselves hold our breath
until we passed out?</i>
<i>Then you'd always get scared
and call Mom</i>
<i>and I'd get in trouble?</i>
<i>That game really sucked.</i>
<i>Do you feel it?</i>
<i>You're not alone.</i>
<i>He's found you again.</i>
Hi, this is a major breach
of library policy,
but I brought you the books.
Are you okay?
What did you take?
Okay.
Come on, come on.
Come on.
Get in the truck.
Watch your head.
I'm gonna get you some help, okay?
Okay. Okay.
You're gonna be okay, okay?
I'm gonna get you some help.
No!
Hey, sleepyhead.
It's time.
<i>"She learned their habits.</i>
<i>She collected
their secrets like weapons,</i>
<i>for one day she would
escape and"--</i>
Hi.
I'm Alice Seversen.
I run the community outreach program
here at Happier Times Care Center.
Would you like a seat?
Your library card, which was
the only ID that we could find on you,
said that your name was Brigitte.
Is that true?
Did you find him?
Find who?
The librarian guy.. Jeremy.
It came through the window.
It attacked him.
No, you suffered a near fatal
anaphylactic reaction.
Listen,
I saw a guy die.
His blood was on my face.
You did have blood on your face,
but it was from the cuts on your arms.
I saw it.
When I was using,
I was convinced that
the deaf Norwegian prep cook,
who lived in the apartment over,
was trying to amputate my legs.
Come in.
- Hi.
- Brigitte, this is Luke.
He's gonna need a blood sample.
My guess is you're not
afraid of needles.
Due to cutbacks, facilities like ours
have had to get creative.
Girls on drugs don't go over too well
in private funding circles.
So, three years ago we became
a dual-care facility.
We house chronic-care patients
from the hospital system.
Barbara was badly burned
in a fire.
That's her granddaughter.
She's here until we find her
a foster home.
The hospital was built in the 1920s
to quarantine tuberculosis patients,
but ours is the only unit
that is still functional.
The other wings
have been closed for years,
- and are strictly out-of-bounds.
- Little freak.
So, you start in lock-up, which
we maintain through your withdrawal,
and then we go from there
based on your progress.
"Had she realized her captors
were capable of terrifying feats?"
- Brigitte, Ghost. Ghost, Brigitte.
- "That at night they used to torture
their prisoners
in vats of pig grease?
She had!
She ran for her life!"
Excuse me, ladies.
It's your choice..
we take you or you come.
We've got a bleeder.
I'm Tyler.
This is Marcus.
That's your cue
to tell us your name.
Your own clothes are being cleaned.
I'm writing again,
which feels like coming home,
because..
well, it's what I do.
And I feel
exhilarated and scared
because I.. I have to face
unadulterated truth
when I'm writing.
Like the fact that
my chemical dependency is:
A, related to stuff
that happened to me as a child;
and B, that I have
to explore that stuff
with you all here;
and C, this time
there's no holding back.
Dr. Brookner,
if she doesn't shut up
I swear I'll make her
drink her piss again.
She'll do no such thing, Winnie.
Brigitte, you have a room of people
pretty curious about Brigitte.
And incidentally, a room full of people
who think you really suck at suicide.
What's your
best-case scenario, hmm?
Go there.
<i>What a loser.</i>
My best-case scenario, Eleanor,
is hair everywhere
but my eyeballs,
elongation of my spine
till my skin splits,
teats, and a growing tolerance,
maybe even affection for,
the smell and taste of feces..
not just my own..
and then, excruciating death.
You know, Brigitte,
some girls find group useful.
- I can't be here.
- You're feverish.
But don't worry,
that's common.
Would you like to talk about
what you were shooting?
I didn't recognize it myself,
which is kind of impressive..
there's not a lot you can stick
that I haven't been familiar with.
It must be great
to be a role model.
Hmm.
Do you mind?
So, tell me...
why were you timing
how long it takes your cuts to heal?
Look, Alice,
if I was messed up
in the way you think I am,
I would really appreciate
someone like you to help me.
And Brigitte...
if I was stupid in the way
that you wish I was,
I'd let you go.
I have been where you are.
You have no idea where I am.
If you keep me here
people are gonna die.
So you know,
threats are a big no-no with Alice.
<i>"If you keep me here
people are gonna die."</i>
<i>Why bother, B?</i>
<i>You know you're healing faster.</i>
<i>It's only a matter of time before
you start changing on the outside too.</i>
<i>You know you're changing.</i>
<i>He knows you're changing.</i>
<i>And he’ll find you.</i>
Hey,
Brigitte's blood work back yet?
Yeah.
And the only thing in her system
is the stuff we found on her.
- It's a plant extract called monkshood.
-  Oh.
- Totally legal, totally accessible.
It's sold in craft stores
for dried flower arrangements.
Ooh, Jesus.
I've never heard of it before.
That's because Monkshood
isn't a stimulant.
No?
What is it then?
A poison...
also called aconitum napellus
or wolfsbane.
But this.. this isn't mild.
This would send the average
adult into aseptic shock.
So she's hooked on poison.
Hey, what did I tell you
about eavesdropping, huh?
Go on, get out of here.
Dudes, Alice.
<i>There are 14 species of maple</i>
<i>native to Canada
and the United States.</i>
<i>Very easy to recognize,
the maple is the only</i>
<i>- deciduous species in North America...
- Hey, B-B.</i>
<i>...with multi-lobed leaves
that grow in pairs</i>
<i>on opposite sides
of the branch.</i>
<i>Most maples will lose these unique
leaves in the autumn.</i>
<i>Suddenly... will have their leaves</i>
<i>turn a vibrant red, yellow
or orange before they fall...</i>
<i>...until the following spring.</i>
<i>A circle of life begins anew</i>
<i>with a fresh set
of these distinct leaves.</i>
<i>...backyard in Southern Ontario</i>
<i>have grown at an enormous rate...</i>
<i>I think it is called the Manitoba...</i>
Wolfsbane.
What are you doing in here?
It's amazing the things you'll find
in this place at night.
- Are you gonna give that to me?
- Mmm-hmm.
But I get to do it.
And I get to chose where.
- Why?
- I bet you were one of those girls
that always asked her mom "Why?"
"Mom, it's cold out, why?"
"Mom, it's dark out, why?"
I need that.
Why?
- Give it to me.
- Okay.
But it has to be in a place
no one else will see.
Pull down your pants.
Fuck you.
That was way out of line.
Good night, Brigitte.
Why do all the ones
that get killed have tattoos?
<i>"Why was he so anxious
to get rid of her?"</i>
Because it was past her bedtime.
Let's go.
Cover your ears to his lies, Rocky.
<i>"Late at night,
in secret chambers</i>
<i>he carried out his reign
of moral terror."</i>
Isn't that mortal terror?
No.
Oh, good boy.
Come here.
<i>Abducted!</i>
<i>Yes, maybe that's it,
we were abducted by aliens.</i>
<i>And they've taken us
back to their planet</i>
<i>and put us in some kind of zoo.
But there's a sign that says,</i>
<i>- "Don't eat the humans"..
- Making up more childhood sexual abuse?</i>
Sticks and stones, fatso.
<i>...unless they're feeding us.</i>
<i>Why wouldn’t they want to fatten
us up before the slaughter?</i>
<i>Unless they are feeding us
and we just don't know it!</i>
<i>...And they're just waiting
and watching..</i>
Ping!
Oh!
This is getting so boring.
It's an ancient game,
the throwing of pennies
at the local moron or midget.
I can't see the TV.
I said I can't see the TV!
Would you like me
to throw you at her head?
<i>What are you doing?</i>
Wow!
Vicious, yet constrained.
That's noble, considering
what you could have done to her.
Next time I'd recommend
smashing Beth-Ann's head
against Koral's like a cymbal
or a battering ram.
- But there's always next time..
- Get lost.
When you close your eyes,
is it hell you see?
The faster you heal,
the closer he gets, B.
Or is that the closer he gets,
the faster you heal?
Oooh, here's a good one.
<i>"At the dawn of darkness
there was a goddess of night</i>
<i>who walked the hills
with a shepherd's stick</i>
<i>and a pack of wild hounds.</i>
<i>The hounds"..</i>
oh, they were from hell..
<i>.."would do her evil deeds
and she wouldn’t lift a finger."</i>
<i>"Her finger.. it was finely jeweled
with baby's teeth."</i>
There you are.
I'm on lunch duty.
You didn't like it when Tyler
came into your room, did you?
The others do.
He tells me everything.
We have an understanding.
- Do you turn at the full moon?
- You watch too many horror movies.
I'm not allowed
to watch horror movies,
or technically, to read comics.
Or to eat foods with gluten..
I'm too impressionable.
- Why doesn't that surprise me?
- Well, not the gluten thing..
that's just digestive.
Your ear.
Get out!
I know where Tyler
keeps his stash.
I said, get out!
Ginger?
<i>We really need to talk.</i>
<i>These last few days
I have been feeling very left out,</i>
<i>watching you hang out
with all your cool, new friends.</i>
It's starting.
<i>So it is.</i>
<i>Well, you have two options then,
don't you?</i>
<i>Either give in,
or give up.</i>
<i>It only dies if you do.</i>
I'm not gonna die.
Ugh.
Here you go.
Can I watch?
Go away, please.
Shh.
Hey!
You touch my stuff again
and I'll tell Alice
where you keep your comics.
Are you sniffing me?
I need it.
Yeah, you said that before.
Why'd you have
to go and do this?
I made a mistake.
Please give it to me.
No.
There has to be
consequences to our actions
or there is no order.
And there has to be order
in a place,
or things get very,
very confused.
I said... I need it.
Save it for group.
Welcome to rehab, baby.
<i>You're starting
to understand, aren't you?</i>
<i>How it all starts with wanting?</i>
<i>What were you thinking
when he was in that stall with you?</i>
<i>Because even I.. really..
was shocked.</i>
I wanted the monkshood.
- I just..
- I just..
<i>What did you want when
he was pushing up against you?</i>
<i>You're starting to figure it out,
aren't you?</i>
<i>How it all starts innocently enough,
today you want to fuck him..</i>
<i>tomorrow you want to bite
a hole in his sternum.</i>
Think of these life skills
filling an imaginary backpack,
ready to hit the road
anytime you do.
Close your eyes.
I am wiping all you've ever been,
all the names
you've ever been called.
Names you've called yourselves..
that's ancient history.
Actually, it's not even history,
because what you're
experiencing is the world
for the very first time.
Think of the structure below,
the wood and metal
that supports you.
And once your hand
is in position
on your clitoris
we'll begin with a gentle,
counterclockwise rotation.
Mmm.
Experiment...
with rhythm.
Find your own.
Visualize the chest of a stranger
as his gaze penetrates you.
Now you are grabbing
what's inside him.
His heart.
The meat.
The sinewy muscle.
Does he scream as you are
ripping his tender flesh?
Oh yes.
And his blood..
it warms your throat.
<i>Great form, B.</i>
Brigitte?
Are you okay, Brigitte?
<i>Beneath the skin</i>
<i>The beast within</i>
<i>Dieing to be</i>
<i>Beneath the stars</i>
<i>Tears and scars</i>
<i>Healing when</i>
10 minutes to lockup.
I want you to come
and see me.
I'm right here.
In my room.
That would be
against the rules.
Please?
Do you smile?
What?
Can you smile?
See...
you smile at the world,
and the world will smile
right back at you.
You should be getting back
to your room.
Will you come?
I'll think about it.
Rocky!
Look what I have!
Rocky!
Rocky?
Rocky?
Just leave it for him.
But Rocky always comes.
You don't look happy.
Are you gonna make me
smile again?
Have you ever considered
another occupation?
You know what?
I am quite happy
playing the small,
but vital role
here at the care facility.
I think it's 'cause
I'm a people person.
So, what is this stuff, anyways?
Does it matter?
Not really.
What's with that?
I have a great sense of smell.
Weird.
There's this vein down here
that is very private.
So you shave?
Well, I think that's just great.
Here you go.
Rocky!
Rocky?
Rocky!
Huh?!
Check back in on you
in a half hour.
What?
"Rocky runs. Rocky plays.
Rocky misses the good old days. "
Why'd you do it?
He wasn't doing anything to you.
I did not do that.
I told them not to leave him
alone outside..
he'd be vulnerable
to all the dangers of the night..
of which you're the worst.
How could I have done that?
I can't even get out of my room.
I don't know.
You.. you move through walls
or something.
Ghost, if I could move through walls,
do you think I'd be in here?
This is important,
where did you find him? Outside?
By the back
of the crematorium wall,
in the abandoned section.
- It found me.
- What found you?
I have to get out of here.
I can get you out.
What did you just say?
I know a way out,
through the vents.
But you have
to take me with you.
I'll knock in a while.
Ghost? Ghost?
Here.
I'll leave the door unlocked, okay?
Just bring that back.
Brigitte?
What.. what are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
Want a snort?
I have to find
a way out of here.
Brigitte?!
Brigitte?
Brigitte?
Brigitte?
Brigitte?
Don't bother.
Alice probably sealed up
every window herself.
Do you ever see things
when you're stoned?
I just saw the freakiest thing.
It is like an animal,
but deformed.
Beth-Ann?
Brigitte!
You said you'd wait for me.
- Go back to the clinic.
- Why?
Wha.. what's going on?
It got Beth-Ann.
How do we get out of here?
- That way.
- We can't go that way.
This way.
Are you sure
this is the way?
Over here.
Ghost?
Ghost? Ghost?
Ghost? Ghost?
Ghost, what are you doing?
We gotta pay the ferryman.
Let's go.
Good luck on your sad journey
to the other side, Beth-Ann.
I'm sorry you were such a cunt.
Faster!
This is the crematorium.
There should be a way
through the back.
In there!
Go! Go!
Come on, go!
Get in the car.
- Do you think it's dead?
- Just go!
Oh God, you're bleeding.
- What if you bleed to death?
- That's the least of our worries.
So was that the one that bit you?
I wasn't bit, my sister was.
And no, it wasn't the same one.
Well.. well,
where did it come from?
The infinite darkness?
I don't think so, Ghost.
I don't like the suburbs.
- If you weren't bit, then..
- I infected myself with her blood.
I thought I could make her stop
if I was like her.
I always wanted a sister.
Where is she now?
She isn't, I stopped her.
You killed your own sister?
There wasn't much
of Ginger left in what I killed.
So.. so what'd you use,
a silver bullet?
A knife.
They're not superheroes, Ghost.
Ooh, baby...
...Passing in the night
So fine
You know it's gonna be
So, come on, come on,
come on, come on, baby
Come on, if you want it to be...
Are you okay?
Your bathrooms are out of order.
- Yeah. You..
-  Come on, love me tonight
And I'll be yours
till the sun comes up...
You can use the staff bathroom.
Come on.
I got chips.
Alice says chips don't fall into
one of the four food groups.
One of her many lies.
You still eat chips, right?
It's happening too fast.
I need the monkshood.
Where's the needle?
Oh crap.
I really need a syringe.
Didn't your grandmother
have diabetes
or an allergy to nuts
or bees or anything?
Why don't you just drink it?
I've tried that, it doesn't work.
Put it up your nose.
That's what all the other girls do.
I never had a sleepover before.
Once I almost did,
but then Barbara told
Caroline Kish's mom
that she'd have
to pay her $9 an hour,
because it was
basically like babysitting.
Is this her?
Your grandma?
Yep. That's Barbara.
She was a provincial curling
champion four years in a row.
You call your grandmother Barbara?
- She called me Ghost.
- Why is that?
Barbara had this book called
"Behavioral Modification"
when I was seven.
It was all about
subconscious messaging.
She called me Ghost because she hates
sudden noises, which I made a lot of.
Sometimes even walking around
made Barbara angry.
She was putting up
Christmas lights in here,
I was in the living room,
and she yelled for me
to plug them in so she could see
which ones were broken.
They lit her synthetic mumu on fire.
When I came in she was screaming,
trying to stop, drop and roll.
But that just got her more and more
twisted up in the lights.
That's really awful.
I'm just shitting you.
She fell asleep with her
bedtime cigarette.
I always told her
not to smoke in bed.
Funny.
After the accident
I took care of her.
- People think that's bad.
- Is that why you're at the clinic?
No, I'm at the clinic because Alice
gets money to keep me there.
Is that right?
Yeah, she just makes up
another thing about me to fix,
like "Hostility
to conventional morality,"
or "ADD"..
that's Attention Deficit Disease.
Actually, that's disorder..
Attention Deficit Disor..
Whatever, or "Inability to communicate
with the other residents."
You've seen them,
who'd want to?
Barbara had dry eyes.
I don't see how that's gonna
get into your blood.
It's not as good as shooting,
but the membrane
behind your eyeball's permeable,
like the bottom of your tongue.
The problem with the mouth
- is the saliva, which kills toxins..
- You like science, huh?
I do too.
Sick.. I can't watch.
It's gonna find you, isn't it?
The fact that
it didn't kill you tonight
means something.
Maybe he's like you
and it's not in his nature to kill,
and he secretly wants..
Ghost...
it wants to mate with me.
Oh.
Don't try too hard
to visualize that.
My sister and I shared a room.
A sleepover every night.
Kind of.
Do you miss her?
All the time.
Ghost?!
Ghost?!
Ghost?!
I'm up here.
What is that thing out front?
Polly.
Polly Ester.
She explodes.
When I get her set up in the yard,
she'll be attached to a trip wire.
We'll see how he likes that.
Is that supposed to be me?
I look tough.
What do you do
with these things?
Trade powers.
Comics are very incoherent.
Their makers send them out
into the world
unprepared for all the demons
and enemies they'll face.
I assess their weaknesses..
make them stronger.
Who's that?
Burned Barbara.
I took away her nerve endings
so she can't feel pain.
So, what are you giving me?
What do you want?
Time.
That's hard.
You have to leave me.
You have to take the car
and you have to get out of here.
You didn't leave your sister.
That was different.
- She was out of control.
- And you aren't?
Look at you.
I'm not leaving you.
"Her isolation was made worse
by a growing desire to devour men..
but she resisted,
for she knew this would bring
destruction and death."
It's just me.
You scared me.
Polly.
We destroyed the monster.
Stay inside, it may still be alive.
Polly got a deer.
"She kneeled to devour
the downy innocent...
And all through the land
the forest creatures wept."
I need more monkshood.
We have to call Tyler.
You have blood on your face.
- Hello?
- It's Brigitte.
What?
Where the hell are you?
I'll give you the clinic car
if you bring me my stuff.
Okay.. okay, just wait.
Let me turn off the TV.
Brigitte, you still there?
Sort of.
It's been an hour.
Shouldn't he be here by now?
Stay here.
In the morning light
Feels so good by me...
Hello?!
It could be so right...
Work hard in the daytime
For our dinner at night
Comfort me at the right time
Everything's gonna be all right
Make me do anything you want
Make me be everything you want
Make me do anything you want.
- That is not funny.
- But it's not completely unfunny.
He's here.
Yes, he is here ladies.
Hey, my car's back there.
Umm..
So this is home, huh, Ghost?
Kind of has a Manson family charm.
You know she took care
of Granny after the fire?
All burned up?
How long was it
until the police showed up?
43 days.
- Yikes.
- Did you bring a needle?
Yeah.
I'm suspended without pay
because of you three taking off.
Yeah, but hey, no big deal.
Where is Beth-Ann anyway?
She went to the city
to see her boyfriend.
She missed him so much, she couldn't
be without him another minute.
- He's very handsome.
- Yeah, I'm sure he is.
You need to relax.
Here, let me do it.
Give it here, all right?
Relax.
He should probably
get going now, right?
You're having a reaction
or something.
Your body's rejecting it.
Okay.. that is not good.
That is not good..
this is not supposed to be hap..
I got.. I got to get you
to a hospital.
Take me anywhere
and I'll tell Alice everything.
Get away from me.
Brigitte?
This is not good. This is so
not supposed to be happening.
- Oh God!
- Brigitte, what's happening?
What is that shit anyway?
Bri..
- Brigitte?!
- Okay. Okay.
- Brigitte?!
- Okay.
All right.
Come here.
Listen, Brigitte is really sick.
I've never seen
anything like this before.
She's really..
yeah...
we're at the grandma's place.
I don't know what to do, okay?
Hey.
- Get out!
- What?
I need to be alone.
She realized of course, she'd have
to come back to the clinic.
You realize of course that you're
speaking in the third person.
It's a little weird.
And I'm aware of no such thing.
What if I said I missed you?
"His words were empty,
just like his head."
Did I hurt you
when I pushed you?
I didn't mean to.
I'm sorry.
Hey, sleepyhead?
It's time.
Ghost?
What happened?
We shouldn't have brought him here.
What happened to your face?
Ghost happened.
- Do you think I need stitches?
- Why would she do that?
Have you been upstairs?
Yes.
I don't think she knows what's real
and what's a cartoon.
That's convenient.
What?
You get off on that, don't you?
What are you getting at?
I'm just shitting you.
Can you help me with the generator?
It needs more gas.
Without consequences to our actions
things get very confused.
Okay.
Shit!
God, no!
God, no!
Don't you just love
the sound of nature?
This ends now.
We can't fight what's in us, B.
I'm not like you, Ginger.
- I'm stronger.
- Oh, really?
That's not how I remember you
the first 15 years of your life.
It's how I remember
the last 15 minutes of yours.
Where's Tyler?
Don't worry about him.
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna kill it.
Get me all the sharp things
you can find.
Are you scared?
What's that?
Gas.
Stand back.
How long will it burn?
Barbara took about 27 minutes.
Get upstairs.
Go back to the darkness!
Ghost?!
You shot at me!
What the hell?
I meant to shoot the monster.
Of course you did.
Get your ass over here
and give me the gun.
Where did you get that from?
Barbara hunted squirrels.
Tyler called me,
where is he? Huh?
In the woods.
Where are the other girls?
Where's Brigitte?
Tyler said that she was
OD'ing again.
Beth-Ann's in the basement
of the clinic,
and Brigitte's here.
She's fine.
Brigitte, come on out!
You were making progress, Ghost.
This is not progress.
What I see is a little girl
who does not divide what is real
and what is a fictional world
in her own mind...
- ...take responsibility for...
Why does it smell
like gas in here?
- To burn the monster.
- Oh, Ghost!
Where did you say Beth-Ann is?
Huh?
- She could eat you, you know.
- Holy shit.
- Brigitte?
- What happened to Grandma?
She fell asleep with a cigarette.
Grandma didn't smoke.
You burnt Barbara.
Did you lie about Tyler too?
"He pushed and he pulled
and he laughed when she cried."
- What did you really do?
- "He took advantage of her heart."
He didn't do it, did he?
He was gonna take you
away from me!
- Step away!
Don't worry, Alice,
I've been where you are.
Oh yeah?
We're gonna get out of here.
I wouldn’t go out there
if I were you.
Upstairs! Quick! Quick! Hurry!
What the hell is out there?
The monster.
It's in the house?
Brigitte?
Brigitte?!
Brigitte?!
Brigitte?!
Ghost!
Hel..
Here.
Ghost, come on, quick.
Nooo!
Brigitte?!
Brigitte?!
No.
No.
Oh my God, something's
still alive down there.
Brigitte?!
Get back upstairs.
I knew you'd find us, Alice.
Kill me.
<i>"Growing steadily stronger
beneath the floorboards,</i>
<i>her faithful companion,
with a deadly hunger for human flesh,</i>
<i>waited to unleash the darkness
and fury of hell</i>
<i>on her mistress's enemies..</i>
<i>- ...of which there were many.</i>
<i>And so began Ghost's reign
of moral terror."</i>
<i>If I was beautiful like you</i>
<i>Oh, the things I would do</i>
<i>Those not so blessed
would be crying out, "Murder"</i>
<i>And I'd just laugh
and get away with it too</i>
<i>Like you do,
if I was beautiful like you</i>
<i>I would never be at fault</i>
<i>I'd walk in the rain
between the raindrops</i>
<i>Bringing traffic to a halt</i>
<i>But that would never be</i>
<i>That would never, never be</i>
<i>'Cause I'm not beautiful like you</i>
<i>I'm beautiful like me</i>
<i>Beautiful like me</i>
<i>If I was beautiful like you</i>
<i>I'd be quick to assume</i>
<i>They'd do anything
to please me, why not?</i>
<i>I see their reaction
when you walk into the room</i>
<i>But that would never be</i>
<i>That would never, never be</i>
<i>'Cause I'm not beautiful like you</i>
<i>I'm beautiful like me</i>
<i>I'm beautiful like me</i>
<i>Beautiful</i>
<i>Beautiful like me</i>
<i>Like me</i>
<i>Like me</i>
<i>If I was beautiful like you</i>
<i>I'd have so many friends</i>
<i>All fighting for my time
to be next in line</i>
<i>So, if I hurt one,
I wouldn’t have to make amends</i>
<i>That would never be</i>
<i>That would never, never be</i>
<i>'Cause I'm not beautiful like you</i>
<i>I'm not beautiful like you</i>
<i>I'm not beautiful like you</i>
<i>I'm beautiful like me</i>
<i>I'm beautiful like me.</i>
