Disneyland...
Palm Springs...
150 miles...
150 miles to Las Vegas!
Jasmin, come here.
Immediately!
You are so rough!
Hey lady, do you need a ride?
Do you feel okay?
Fill it up... mister?
Have you?
I search my wife.
A big woman...
from Germany.
<i>Sal!</i>
Mister, I...
<i>Sal! Where the hell
have you been so long?</i>
One beer!
- No beer.
- No beer?
No license.
Coffee.
- No coffee.
- No coffee?
The machine is not working.
Finally a good coffee!
Very good... coffee!
<i>Sal! You set up
the new coffee machine?</i>
You...
- How much?
- It's on the house.
No charge!
Good service...
Thank you.
Good bye
What's going on?
Where's the coffee machine?
Honey,
you won't believe it...
but I forgot it again!
Mind if I ask you a question?
What is that on your shoulders?
Come on, Brenda...
What kind of cafe doesn't
serve coffee?
Sal...
Did you pick up my rifle?
You must be kidding, Mr. Cox!
He's got a mind like a worm!
Sometimes I wonder how
he remembers to come home.
There's no hurry!
How about a cup of coffee?
Heard that, Sal? Mr. Cox
would like a cup of coffee.
You see Mr. Cox, normally
we would be glad to serve you...
but the boss forgot
to pick up the new coffee machine...
which was the reason he went
to town in the first place.
It just slipped his mind!
- What is that?
- You mean that?
- What is that?
This?
Are you putting me on?
Because if you are...
You call this coffee?
Cahuenga...
Water, please!
Junior, stop a minute!
What was that poison?
Salomo!
But there's no one here, mom.
I am, and your music...
is driving me crazy!
It sounds like a sewing machine.
Sal, what is that thing?
I found it.
Found it?
Found it where?
On the highway.
By the old
picnic area.
And you just took it?
Are you crazy?
It didn't belong to nobody.
What makes you so sure?
It doesn't belong to nobody here!
Sal...
Sal, you are such a child!
I got two children
I don't need three!
Clean that shit up!
That's more like it.
Sal, you take that back
where you find it, now!
It certainly is practical,
Brenda... isn't it?
- Sure is.
- It is practical, honey...
Don't you honey me!
Have you understood it in that way:
We need a coffee machine
and not a toy.
Where are you going?
You take the thermos bottle.
Get it!
Get it!
- All this fuss about nothing!
- That's just it!
- What? Nothing.
What do you do here?
That's all you do around here!
I work myself to the bones!
If you just stop being
so damn bossy...
Somebody has to run things
around here!
I run the gas station.
Two trucks a day, and I got to
pick up the empty oil cans.
- Nobody is forcing you.
- You God damn mother fucker!
You better take that thing
where you found it!
Sal! You do like I say!
If you don't cut that shit...
I'm leaving!
The sooner the better!
You are in the rag or what?
Get the hell out of here!
What are you waiting for?
Move it!
Hi, mom.
Mom?
Mom... that's Zack.
He's totally red!
Mom, I have...
like this little problem.
We want to go
to this concert, but...
you got a little bread?
No you don't!
Thanks, mom.
- Take it easy, Brenda...
- You go to hell!
I don't come back neither!
I'll get rid of this!
I won't cry over you!
Is anything wrong, Brenda?
The motel office?
What can I do for you?
- A room.
- Here?
Yes!
Are you sure?
Sure.
Are you sure you don't
want me to call you a cab?
No
Fill this out.
Salomo!
A single or a double room?
Single.
- Did your car break down?
- No car.
No car?
Sure.
That would be 25 dollars.
Cash or charge?
How do you want to pay?
How do you want to pay,
cash or charge?
- Where's the boss?
- I'm the boss.
Traveler's check?
Is ok..
Here is your change...
your key.
- One night, right?
- I don't know.
Where is it?
Mrs. Jasmin!
You gotta carry your suitcase
yourself. We ain't no Grand Hotel!
My name is Mrs. Munchgstettner.
Okay, Mrs. Mu... nsh... tetter!
The center... is it far?
- What center? The shopping center?
- The center of Bagdad.
- This is Bagdad.
- Is this all? This is it.
Hello, stranger.
I like your hat.
Really!
Two cokes, Se√±or Cahuenga!
Plenty of ice!
Coffee, please.
No coffee, mam.
Coffee machine is broken.
May I, miss?
Miss... Just a second...
No! It's good so.
- Whatever you say.
- Thank you.
Brenda, look at my latest edition.
Dynamite, isn't it?
Fantastic!
Debby is a real little witch
with that needle.
See you next time,
you little devil!
- Hello, Mrs...
- What?
That.....
Shit! That thing is still here.
That son of a bitch.
Here...
You like it? It's yours.
Put this baby on the high chair.
He's gonna be ready for dinner.
Sal! Sal Junior!
Wake up!
Damn! Do I have to do
everything myself?
Planning on staying for a while?
Allow me to introduce myself.
Rudi Cox.
How do you do.
Frau Munchgstettner.
From Hollywood.
You know...
Tinseltown.
The movies...
What the hell?
Jesus, I hate things that
don't make sense!
- Good morning, Mrs. Brenda.
- Morning, Cahuenga.
Phyllis!
Wake up, damn it! The school bus
will be here in a minute!
Roll your lazy ass out
of that bed this instant!
But, mom I don't have
school today.
Stop! Not so much water.
You clean room 7.
I mean business.
But Pete will pick me up!
Salomo!
Take care of your son!
Where is dad?
What is this shit?
Is she trying to put me on?
I knew she was weird...
Can I talk to the sheriff, please?
Thanks.
Arnie, it's Brenda.
There's this woman who checked in
last night from Rosenheim...
I don't know where it is either.
Somewhere over there in Europe.
She's got the weirdest things.
I can't make head to tail.
It's hard to say.
I think you'd better come
and check yourself.
The sooner the better!
I don't know
how dangerous she is.
Well.
And another thing...
Can you do me a favor?
Our coffee machine.
Could you bring her?
That would be great.
I'll see you later.
Okay, lady, we're gonna
check you out!
Dangerous?
Hello, Brenda. I get it.
Thank you, Arnie, it is very nice.
Cahuenga!
I make it
Hi, sheriff.
Why do we have the honor?
Brenda has a little problem here.
Debby? No.
Come on Arnie, I'll show you.
Mr. Cox, your breakfast is ready.
Hello, mam.
Ma'am...
Excuse me, ma'am.
I'm the sheriff in these parts.
It's just routine check.
You understand, we being
so close to Las Vegas.
What if I can I see some
identification, please?
You see them? Go on, ask her!
Germany? I have a brother who
was in Germany in the service.
Munchgstettner...
Munchgstettner...
You got an airplane ticket?
Is it a round ticket?
Do you mind if I have a look at it?
What are you waiting for?
Thank you
Well, everything seems to be okay.
You plan on to stay long?
Someone plan on joining you?
Sorry for the inconvenience, ma'am.
Have a nice stay.
Goodbye.
Don't tell me that was it!
You gotta be kidding!
Is that why I have you come
up here for? I don't believe it.
She shows up out of no where,
without a car, without a man
She ain't got nothing but
a suitcase with man's clothes.
Why?
How come she acts so funny?
Like she was going to stay here forever..
and with no clothes.
No! I don't like it!
It don't make any sense at all!
- I don't make no sense!
- What?
Arnie, forget it.
Just forget it.
Why are you excited about?
I've seen her passport and her
airline ticket and they're ok.
She's a tourist.
What she wears is her business.
That's right, Brenda, it's her business.
But not yours, Mr. Cox!
Maybe she's a fashion designer, or...
or a saleswoman for European
country western clothes.
And I'm Dolly Parton!
You know as long as she doesn't
break the law...
she can dress up like Baby Doll or
King Kong. It's a free country!
it's a free country.
Keep out of this!
- Does she pay you?
- With traveler's checks.
Come on. Brenda.
What more do you want?
Where's Sal, anyway?
Thank you for the coffee machine.
Don't mention it.
Get ready, Debby, baby, here I am!
Bye, mom.
- Where's the baby?
- He is sleeping.
Hello...
You shouldn't have...
- I want to pay.
- You mean you're staying?
- Yes.
Oh no...
We need coffee, sugar...
Milk
Normaly bought Mr. Sal,
but he's gone.
Bread...
Eggs..
Mrs. Brenda's husband?
Yes, Ma'am.
Ground meat ..
What?
Beans and chili dip...
Bacon...
Pickles...
Where is he?
- Who?
- Brenda's husband.
They had a fight.
Did he leave her?
Oil...
tomatoes...
peanuts...
salad...
Thanks.
Here is the list, Mrs. Brenda.
- Who wrote this?
- Mrs. Jasmin.
I'm going to town.
Phyllis!
Phyllis!
You stay here!
Get out!
I gotta go shopping.
You gonna stop this truck?
Phyllis, stay here
while I gotta go shopping.
Come back, damn it! Somebody's
got to take care of the station!
Shit, shit!
You all can kiss my ass.
I'm going to town.
See how you get along without me!
Hello, mam...
- Where the hell did you come from?
- Of that truck.
- So?
- Do you mind if camp here?
I don't give a damn what you do.
Thanks. I appreciate it.
Something is wrong.
I feel it.
Cahuenga!
Who was it?
Mrs. Brenda.
My office!
Who was it?
I...
I... thought you would like it.
It would make you happy,
it would be nicer to work in...
Like it?
Something must be wrong
with my ears!
Is that Mr. Cox's rifle?
- Did they fix the trigger yet?
Imagine a motel guest is trying...
to make me happy?
- I don't believe it!
I don't believe this! Come here!
This used to be my office, right?
My office.
Look at it!
How is this supposed to be an office?
You call this an office?
It's empty!
How is anybody supposed to work in here?
You mind telling me that, Mrs?
Mrs. Munchgstettner.
Comer here, Mrs.Whatever-your-name-is!
Who give you permission, anyway?
Who said it was any of your business?
What business was it of yours?
And where is everything?
What did you do with everything?
In the garbage? That's fantastic!
That's just fantastic!
Now, you listen to me.
You bring it back in here...
everything! And you put it
all right back just like it was.
Every last thing!
Just like it was!
Oh, cut it out...
Oh, Brenda...
Just like it was!
Stop it...
- Pick up my rifle?
- I sure did, Mr. Cox.
Hi, mom.
That trucker was a real
cute dude for a trucker.
He left me in town,
then I ran into Reggie...
and we bused around in his mobile
over the Devil's Playground.
Then we ran into these
really air heads.
- What happened here?
- Pick up your shit, sweetie.
Pick up your shit!
This is an office for costumers!
- Coffee? - Just made it.
Don't do...
Here.
- Coffee?
Fresh.
Take care, Miss Brenda, no...
Here.
- How much do I own you?
- Nothing, they couldn't fix it.
- Baby has been feed yet?
- Yes, Mrs. Brenda.
Cut it!
Salomo!
You heard!
We have a costumer.
- Just because of that fat bitch?
- Behave! She is a costumer!
- What about them?
- They are kind of family.
That's not coffee,
that's brown water!
Cut that out and do your homework.
Do your homework!
- Mom, I only got two left.
- You heard me!
Phyllis,
move you but!
What are you doing here?
I was just cleaning up...
about yesterday...
I didn't me to...
I'm sorry I stuck my tongue that way...
That's ok.
You are?
Phyllis.
I'm Jasmin.
Jasmin.
Do it suit you?
Absolut.
I would lend it to a friend.
We could be friends.
It's easy.
Fine, Phyllis.
Ok, Jasmin.
Your clothes are different.
Would you look?
Yes, yes! please...
I get to do its fit?
Yes.
But it's.gigantic
Except for this, the rest is
all men's clothes, right?
- How come?
- Maybe I tell you some time.
- What are these?
- Leather dungarees.
- Leather dungarees?
- Leather dungarees.
There's place for two!
What's the matter?
They are so light inside.
Cute?
I like them too.
Come on
And these things?
Socks. I show you.
I saw on TV once.
These dudes slapping their feet
and beating each other heads.
Bavarian folk dancing
Watschnplattler.

- You like it?
Don't stop.
Keep playing!

I have to paint you!
But you are an actor, I think.
An actor?
I never said I was an actor.
But Hollywood? The movies?
I painted the sets.
In your room...
What?
You want to paint in my room?
In your room, there's a painting...
The light in the sky?
I painted that.
Would you like to see

I've had it!
And I ain't take it no more.
No way!

Just what is it your game?
You got something against me?

I don't know what got into me.
All the work around here,
and the kids, and everything...
and my husband left me
a week ago...
Good evening, Mrs. Jasmin.
Good evening, Mrs. Brenda.
How about some crackers?
- Crackers?
- Crackers.
Magic!

- You bet!
Magic!
My vision
I like that word.
What word?
Vision.
How does it come there ...

Rays of sun reflected by the mirrors ...
in our solar energy center cause it.
Breaker, Breaker, 10.19,
Soul Sultan calling Snake Eyes.
Here, Snake Eyes.
You got, Soul Sultan.
<i>Have you ever been

My comb!
I think you are even sexier topless.
- How are you?
- Fine.
- Hi lady, nice to see you.
- Hello, sheriff.
I thought you would be
in good Europe by now.
You working here?
She's just helping out, Arnie.
Then she needs a green card,
you know that.
She's not working.
And your tourist visa has expired.
I'm sorry but I'll have to report it.
Goodbye, Mrs. Brenda.
Bye, Mrs. Jasmin.
You closed or what?
Where are the ladies?
- What happened to the magic?
- The magic is gone.
is gone!
Right.
All way over to the left.
Further, further.
Up, up.
To high!
Alright.
Just there.
Bagdad Gas and Oil.
Hello?
This is Brenda.
Where are you calling from?
Very nice, you see once again, Mrs...
M√ºnchgstettner.
How are you, Mr. Cox?
Do you stay this time longer?
I hope so, Mr. Cox.
Mam! Come ... to Miss Debbie!
Nice to see you, Debby!
What's the matter? How come
all your stuff is out here?
What's going on here?
- Why do you wanna leave?
- Too much harmony!
Oh, Brenda...
Jasmin?
It's me, Rudi Cox.
Good morning, Rudi.
Morning.
May I come in?
As a painter or as a gentleman?
As a man.
Then you must wait until
I put something on.
Thank you.
Please, sit down.
- How are you?
- Fine.
- How are you?
- Fine.
I wanted to ask you if you
plan on staying longer.
It could be...
what I mean...
certain problems could arise again.
You know what I mean,
green card, visa...
Yes
There's a way to take care
of those problems.
Yes...
If somebody would marry
an American citizen...
Yes...
For example...
if I asked you...
if I asked you...
to marry me...
Yes...
and if you said yes...
you could stay here forever.
Yes.
Will you marry me, Jasmin?
I have to talk it over with Brenda...
