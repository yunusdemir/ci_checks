<i>That year, when
Kolovrat was born,</i>
<i>Genghis Khan smashed the
Russian army on Kalki.</i>
<i>The captured princes and dukes of
Horde were tied up to the rafts.</i>
<i>Moves on them to sail and
strangle them all to death.</i>
<i>But they did not break the Russians.</i>
<i>Kolovrat, like every boy,
wanted to become a soldier.</i>
Take me to the army.
Come on, take me.
I can play with a sword.
And with two I can.
Look, I'll show you.
Again, it spread.
I need to hold him for the mill.
At least they would flour flour.
Do not strangle the patches.
Come here.
You rotate fast, I give it. Easy.
But you have to do
what you ordered.
And it was ordered
that you guard Nastya.
You see that you are mournful too.
Go and help!
Ratmir, why did you bring the girl?
Is not she early in the forest to jump?
You also remember me.
That you did not agree?
What should a poor girl
do between four walls?
Let it breathe clean air,
it is useful to her.
You want me to play you? -Not.
You rotate well, like the sun.
I'll call you Kolovrat.
Occupied!
Nastja!
Frula! My flutter!
- In Ryazan! Quickly!
Go quickly for help!
Watch it!
What are you doing there?
I am here!
Where are you going?
Boy, I'm coming!
Run away!
You fool!
Back on the back!
Slowly.
You see? No blood.
You wounded, but the wound healed.
That was long time ago.
13 years ago.
13 years ago? -Yes.
Remember, glory to God.
Horda thought you were dead.
And you woke up tomorrow.
Now you are a tenth of
the prince of Yuri.
Prince... Yuri? -Yes.
You teach soldiers to fight
together, and not specifically.
I remember this house.
This is your home.
This is Ryazan.
- Yes, we are in Ryazan.
After that wound, when you
wake up, you forget something.
But you remember afterwards.
There...
...pancakes.
I remember. -Children love.
You have two of them.
- You and... -God.
And I called you Kolovrat in
your childhood. Do you remember?
Now everyone is calling you that.
- Nasty?
Your wife. -Nastya.
Good morning.
Kolovrate! Wake up?
The prince calls you on the wall.
Somebody approaches the city.
This is Carcun? -Karkun, exactly.
He stopped there. Just bothering.
What are you doing?
Snow got on, barely caught.
- Come on, do not spill.
Otherwise, your bosses will be guilty.
- What else...
Kosata zivotinjo! Everybody's gone!
Yesterday you warned Dobromir
that Horde was spinning around.
He did not listen to you, Duke.
That's why she's annoyed on the bed.
He wants to fight in the open field.
Is not it a fool?!
He takes a little of
it, he's grown old.
And I would command
hundreds and thousands.
I would also forbid the yeast to drink.
LEGEND OF KOLOVRAT
(FURIOUS)
<i>Evpatije Lvovièu.
- Smear lightning with a resin!</i>
Evpatije Lvovièu! -Here we go!
<i>Now the Duke will be angry.
- And who?</i>
<i>When he's asleep! -Come on, you stupid!</i>
Hello, Prince.
Hello.
What do you think?
They do not see the features.
No voice is heard.
We need to burn them!
It's Horde!
You forgot.
Dad, will there be war?
<i>Tell me, can you
get out of there?</i>
Go home.
Get ready, guys!
And? Shoot the guns?
We are waiting!
We are waiting.
These are the Brits! Brjanci!
Prince Brjansky with a shower.
They come for baptism.
Silence! Move!
Calm down!
What did I say to you?
And you see how to fool!
Open the gates, heroes!
Wait for guests!
Close combat with a small machine.
Divide yourself!
Close combat with a small machine.
Prepare yourself!
Attitude!
Seci!
Beat!
Men are beaten to death,
and women for you.
- Ma, stop it!
Attack! Seci!
Cover yourself!
She's the prince's sister.
Yesterday you asked me to give you.
And who are you?
Hello, Fyodor!
Why are you late?
You forgot.
Today he has baptism. -Whose?
My son. You baptize him.
Do you remember?
Did you see Hordu in color?
Come on!
I'll be one of your five
companions to agree.
<i>And what do we have a prince?</i>
<i>I would wink him.
- Watch that you do not blink.</i>
Shields as support!
Hit him on his left foot.
Here's a grip!
I was walking.
- Do not be so tough in the fight.
Ma, carry on!
Fagoso, my dear.
- Move!
The knight is fighting,
and the five are afraid.
Enough! I'll tell the prince
everything about your nonsense!
Close combat with a small machine.
I'm a jeweler! I got you!
- Daddy! -Here is.
I found him by the door.
- How he coughed.
Fallen, buddy.
It's winter, it's all frozen.
Ježič. -Dad, there will not be much.
I'll get his milk.
Would you like to watch
how do you eat milk?
- Yes! We will!
I made you a flute.
Do you remember losing her?
I cleared three of the snow.
Do you want anything else?
Time to go.
What... every day I'm telling you?
- Yes.
And every day you tell me love.
It's time for baptism.
Baptism is the use of God's Joan.
In the name of the Father. Amin.
And the Son. Amin.
And the Holy Spirit.
Amin.
And you give it to me.
It's only a tenth with you.
I would make him the
Duke of Brjansk.
People! People!
Horda has arrived!
They got stacked!
Go on.
Whoever wants to go to Me,
let Him give up himself.
<i>Let him take his baptism and follow Me.</i>
<i>Blessed are those who are forgiven of
iniquity and who are covered by sins.</i>
<i>Blessed is the man whom the
Lord does not commit sins.</i>
Who will bury them all?
Open the gate! Let us go!
Open the gate! -Where to?
I tell you, back!
Horde will kill us. Move!
Get out of here!
Erophy, screw the bolts!
- You owe me another bed.
You leave them women.
- What are you doing, dumb!
I have to save the children!
I'm telling you, kids!
Prince, I do not
understand military work.
But as I have been elected to the
City Council, I will say this...
We do not have to fight with Horde.
There are huge powers.
They will kill the
people and destroy Riazan.
- Then go and wait for
them with bread and salt.
Keep talking.
We should give them tribute.
We can give them a
fight without a fight.
We may be impoverished, but
we will keep the city.
To buy out.
- And if the evil was saved?
We need to get ready for battle.
- We have a little.
Father, each of us
is worth 10 Hordin.
Too bad, we could not send
a messenger for help.
You, Vasily...
as you wanted, go with
the Hordes with gifts.
Trade and do whatever you want,
But give me time.
They will only speak with the prince.
- Kneže.
You do not have to leave the city.
You're right talking.
I need more here in Ryazan.
Fjodore!
You will go with Vasili.
And from people take...
Do not cry, you fool!
Hide the kids!
Let's go to the southern gate!
- I was there! The same closed!
And I'll open it to you!
- Stani! -Are not you wrong?
Wait! You're a prince of ten.
- So?
Do they let me out of town?
I'm an eagle.
If they let me go, I'll give you
the grass that will help you
in all diseases.
Your wife will be happy.
They surrounded the city.
If you get out, you're done.
Good people!
The most humorous man in Ryazan.
Did you look from the ramparts
and see how many of them are?
It's Bat!
I was in Horde!
I know them all.
I have a young woman.
There is one! Marfinka.
My owner!
My beauty!
I can not keep an eye on you.
Open the gate!
<i>I dug my boots.</i>
<i>I hit a bang with my feet.
It's all about wet.</i>
Your beard is sharp. -Boljar is here.
- Go. Start with me.
Here we go! I know a lot of songs.
- Baby? I love the songs.
Assemble your damn.
You're going to Horde.
With Fjodor.
Do not get angry, dons.
Make someone else
go with Fjodor.
Sit down.
I'm not ordering you.
Please.
Neither Fyodor nor Vasily can be
tricky, I can not believe it.
Fjodor is awesome, quickly ignited.
Just listen to you.
And Vasily is everything in gold.
I need an agreement...
with a can.
Or give me a couple of days
with the negotiations.
At least to strengthen ourselves.
Answers!
Do not bother him! -Nasty!
Do not make him go!
There is a memory problem!
When she wakes up, she does
not remember anything!
Bunovan wakes up!
Everything breaks at home!
<i>When he wakes up, he's 13!</i>
<i>He's constantly returning to this battle
and that's why he breaks it all down!</i>
No one knows!
<i>Just Carcount!
I just told him!</i>
I'm still waiting for him to pass
through and his memory is back.
Open.
How much more will I suffer?
Wait, Prince!
I'll go with Fjodor.
16, 17.
Silver folds to the bottom.
And watch that it does not spill!
Hello, Corneille. -Hello.
Thankfully for him.
- All wealth is distributed.
Vidar! Did you say that
you were in Horde?
Well? -Do you know their tongue?
- I know a lot of languages.
Then you go with us.
- Where to? -This!
I'm a sick man!
Not until you fall off your leg!
Here is. I burned you for the road.
She'll go with you. It will help
you remember and carry a book.
There is no need. -Has.
Do not object.
Come back quickly.
I want a new one.
Here we go.
Nastja!
Karkune! Watch it!
You forgot again.
War?
We'll see.
Translator? -What is it?
What is their grandfather talking about?
- Explaining them a command.
If you listen, they'll hit you.
And why are they laughing?
Antichrists.
They eat girls, with a white onion.
God is with us.
Great henna, big Horde.
Prince Yuri trusted us to
surrender to the son of heaven
modest gift.
And please accept...
These modest gifts.
Eat!
Try it.
Milk from the mare.
Just do not spit on him. It was acid.
Just do not spit. -Do not spit.
Just do not spit. -Do not spit.
Great henna...
Let us know,
What do you want from the Rjazans?
Big Kan says he did
not ask for anything.
He did not call
you, you came alone.
He likes watching you.
Ryazan will be the first Russian
city of the Great Khan.
Your country needs a master.
Eat.
Great Kan says,
Whoever kneel before
him, he will eat well.
Look, I'm not kneeling.
I did not understand, repeat.
The prince wanted to say...
There is one proverb with us...
"First jump and say hop".
Do you think the big can
kneel before some of you?
I think that everything will be yours,
when it does not exist.
Bring the charter.
Great Kan wants
that some of the soldiers
accidentally do not kill you.
To see the negligence of your flock...
and the size of his people.
This Charter...
lets you...
to walk all the
countries of Batu Khan.
No soldier should attack you.
You can ask from every prince,
under the authority of the khan:
horse, title and equipment.
If you move, they will kill you.
I have no more power to
curse what I'm holding.
I'll give it a lift.
If I'm dying then
I'll be in color!
Yes maybe... our...
Warning?
Run! -Be safe!
U boj!
All of this!
Follow me!
Do not be late!
Ratmir, hurry!
Together!
Everyone on horses!
Do not hesitate! Here we go!
Let's go to the forest!
Fjodore!
Here we go! -The knight
will break them five.
Get rid of people!
Kill me! Kill me!
Do not touch the prince.
You do not have to follow it.
The fighter will kill him.
Save Hordu.
What is she like? For many
years I have not seen Nasty!
I'm afraid she will not recognize me.
I wonder how she is.
She's my wife.
How? What kind of woman?
- We have children too. Two.
Imagine I got hurt?!
And my grandfather became.
Let's go faster! Forward!
Kolovrate! We need to light a fire!
We'll all be freezing!
We should not stop!
We have to arrive in Ryazan.
Let's roll in the circle!
We are far!
Ryazan is surrounded!
I'm telling you that we will die!
We'll get through!
Stop!
Do not be afraid!
Potatoes do not eat Ruse!
Drink! You're going to sleep like a kid.
Grasses help sleep.
And the liver of the hedgehog.
It's too late to sleep.
At dawn we'll move.
- You will not get to Ryazan.
He will not calm
down until tomorrow.
Drink! -Not. I do not need it.
You chose a strange temptation.
I and I can sleep
on the bare ground.
And in the monastery I
had another temptation.
I was wearing my skin...
- Are you in the grass?
And is there any grass
that I can not sleep?
And what about you?
It's not for me, for my brother.
He has a memory problem.
If you're lips, forget everything.
And then he swears a long time.
Happy.
Everyday you start life again.
But you do not remember the bad one.
Come on, Nestor! You see,
the icebergs will fall.
Map.
Be careful not to lose.
Write that you would not forget.
Lado!
You wounded, but the wound healed.
That was a long time ago, 13 years ago.
I have not slept.
I need a book.
Feel the fire.
- The forest was probably burning.
On the. Do not tremble.
It's not forest.
We're not slaves, guys!
Beautiful, we are not slaves.
Kill the Duke!
Mum!
Not!
Father, I'll save you!
Daria!
Run away!
Let him go.
Assemble survivors.
The killers! The killers are back!
They'll kill us!
Hide the kids!
I see you learned to
fight with two swords.
What are you doing? Poor me...
He'll be back soon.
We need to run!
Are you running? Run away!
- Why are you pushing a man?
What are you doing, fool? Hide,
the old people! -You're smart!
When Horde returns,
everything will kill us! All!
Where to hide?
There was not a whole house left.
Let's go to the neighbor.
They did not burn.
And when they're burned,
what will you do then?
If we do not save the neighbors,
we will not survive the winter.
How can we save them?
This is Horde's ticket.
I saw her in Batu's tent.
Prince Yuri failed to send messengers.
We will send them.
Horda is going to the river. This way.
Bato's army is huge.
We all have to fight against them.
Let messengers tell the
princes that they will bring
you to the field under
the Pleshivata mountain.
And we will provide them with time.
We'll try to turn
Horrid towards you.
How to measure with
them? -They're going to
suck us. Celu Hordu?
- But you made it up!
Who knows the road to
Vladimir, Kolomna and Murom?
Yeah. And I.
I know the winter way to Kolomna.
And what are we going to do with the kids?
- You can not fight with children and women.
Let them stay, how different?
There is nothing!
Take them to the
cave, near Nestor.
You travel to Vladimir.
You in Murom.
And where are you going to be?
- I'm like a house.
Where the Starica is
divided into two parts,
turn right. Otherwise, the Horde
will fall into your hands.
I will not fall their
hands, I'm a fortune.
May God guard you.
Now let's think...
how to turn to Horde.
I know how.
Grass? -Traves, grass.
Help?
- They're not those grass. Push it.
I tell you the poison is checked!
Karkune! Give me the bow.
Onion!
You are ordered to
check food and water!
I'll cut your ears and
feed the dogs to them!
You there! Binders Tarhane, to me!
Get him alive!
<i>Look, good onion.</i>
They know they're sewing! Antichrists!
And? To eat?
Vojvodo! -He's leading you people now.
You were a duke, you will...
They shot him!
They shot him! What are you standing?
Slowly, breathe.
Why are you standing? -Hush hush!
Fell asleep. He did not sleep
for three days.
Tie him up.
And come to eat.
Fell asleep.
Interesting.
Soon they will bring them.
Go.
Outside!
Holy Mother of God,
make her win...
that Horde turned around, that
the war would no longer be.
Totally. Never.
That all of us
return to our homes.
Make me like that...
to notice me. Take note.
The Lord with 5 loaves and 2
fish fed 5 thousand people.
How much longer will you be?
- Would you just be brave?
Take it. -Here you go!
<i>They say that Jews are insect-feeding.
Strange people.</i>
<i>I do not know, but I'm sick.</i>
Hey, come here!
Eat. Take him too.
You should wake him up.
We'll be moving soon.
Slowly.
Here is. You see there is no blood.
Wounded you, wound healed.
That was a long time ago, 13 years ago.
We're in the woods now.
You serve as a tsar with Prince George.
You teach your dad to...
Not!
Hold it! -Stay!
Tie it well! Tie him up!
Slowly! Wake up! Hold it!
Do not screw it. -Give her up!
You stripped him, you fool!
Remember!
Batu was burned by Riazan!
Let's go to him!
We want to turn it on ourselves!
Remember!
I remembered.
Excuse me... guys.
I know how to wake up.
They say I made a mistake.
Hey! -What is it?
- You did everything well.
Against the Horde we
have to fight together.
Evpatius Lvovich asks you to
bring the government army
on the field under the
Plešivata mountain.
There will be an army
from Murom and Kolomna.
We will strike from all sides...
and we'll break Horrid.
Is Batu's army numerous?
- Huge, they are numbered into 10 species.
They go for ice, the river Oka.
The messenger is telling the truth.
Surveyors saw Horde.
They counted at least 10 thousand.
The city needs to be saved for siege.
Call the Duke to me.
And that Euphthi is yours.
- Who is this? -Kolovrat.
The tenor was in the prince's cell.
Desetar?
And how much is his army?
- More than 20.
What's twenty? One thousand?
Warriors. Twenty warriors.
Each one is worth 100.
He came to joke with us.
We want to take our
army out of town,
and jump in the
woods with a tenth.
Go from us.
God is helping you.
He is not a common tenth. -Go.
Bring the Duke!
He says that everyone will gather
under the Plešivata mountain.
I'll give you...
a relaxing horse.
And with all your affliction,
that she will not get help.
To fight with Horde,
in the open field...
safe death.
What can I say Kolovratu?
I need the army here.
With God!
They did not come back. -Damn it!
Get out of the way!
Evening gray sky, powerful Tengra,
protect me and save evil spirits!
Hey, what's up with you?
I saw the trouble!
What do you mean?
Forest spirits.
Let's go, let's go!
Karkune, try it!
Ma, swallow.
And what is that? You saw the rot
from the moor? -Of course.
We'll scare them. They're superstitious.
I saw the trouble!
Forest spirits attacked us!
Forest Spirits!
Get moving!
I swear, I saw a forest spirit.
Great henna.
Surveyors caught him today.
Terrible?
Terrible.
What a runaway when
they saw a green man!
If we do two more
such visits to them,
Vladimir will go after us.
Here is. Horde's wine.
It's made from cow's milk.
Leave for the rest!
- Good, huh?
Fatigue? -Popius.
Did you get stuck? You drink.
We have a lot of work tomorrow.
The armies have to come.
And will it come?
He'll come.
And where would you go?
Slowly. Slowly.
They wound you, but the wound was over.
That was a long time ago, 13 years ago.
You were a tenth with Prince George.
We're in the woods now.
We fight with Batu Kan
because he burnt Riazan.
I'm your wife... Lada.
My wife is called Nastya.
I did not forget.
You are my memories of the home...
only.
Horses are heard. Far.
I thought our people would not come.
- Stay here, I'll look.
Guards.
Karkune! Over here! Over here!
Great Tangri.
Attack!
Cover it!
They drink blood and get drunk.
This and more.
In Dalgya, the forest spirit
took three hundred souls.
I did not believe my eyes.
They all saw it.
Without a big henna,
spirits will swallow us.
Ghosts were afraid of Genghis Khan.
He was a big can.
Outside!
Batu Kane.
I served your grandfather and your father.
I've been fighting all my life.
He walked and defeated.
But I can not fight the ghosts.
I know that our ghosts did not squash
our water and attack our camp.
But I saw it myself.
What did you see?
That Russian was on the field alone.
We surrounded him.
A snowstorm rising,
and a huge beast came out of it.
She attacked us, and then
the Russians appeared.
When I was a kid, you
gave me a riddle.
Long, black, can not sleep.
Do you remember?
I did not even notice
how old you were.
It's a shadow.
Russians can not win us.
And fear can.
All my soldiers must see that they
are not ghosts, but ordinary people.
Poor people.
Turn around the army.
But Kane... all the army?
Start.
Will he really help?
- There's no better ghosts.
Go potatches.
It's not your battle.
We will manage ourselves. Goodbye.
Thank you, monk.
- Nestor is my name.
You were with me in the cave.
You were telling me I
was starting a sword.
So I talked you?
- I'm judging myself.
As soon as war is, our God means,
and the power of God does not pray.
They have many gods,
and ours is one.
That's why I decided that
the Lord needs help.
I gathered people in the villages.
The guys sent me to ask...
Is it true that you fought
with the thousands?
Is it true that you can swing
with four swords? Show.
Is it true that you slaughtered
40 of them from Horde?
No 40... than 50.
And seven of us were.
Got it? -I did.
Give me some water!
There... there... Horde.
I'm turning the whole army.
Going to us.
Turn them around!
Turn around! -Turn around!
Until next winter he will
not leave the forest.
How come, Lord?
There are a lot of kids with us. Whey.
Here is a gift of the forest spirit.
Small snowflakes.
How did you get frozen?
And where to go? They do not
even have homes or parents.
We will find an undeveloped
country, we will build a new city.
We will raise children, and they will.
We should believe.
We should go to the forest.
- How about the forest? And children?
It's going to get cold.
- With such a burden,
how will we fight
Horde in the forest?
Let's split up. Kids on one
side, we're on the other side.
That will not survive.
If the rivers reach out
and lift the kernel,
They fly by ice. No horse
will come to them.
How much do they need?
- The bullet started turning.
We have to succeed.
Prepare the sled. -Yup.
We will keep Hordu until the raft
with children gets to the river.
And so will the princes with
the army wait for them.
You will go with Lad.
Do not object.
Here is a word curl.
This is Horde.
Behind the river is the direction. The
forest is thick, no one goes there.
When you get out straight,
lift up the sail.
Karkune...
You have only one task.
To save your children.
<i>The core is well tethered.
- The most important thing</i>
<i>is having the wind. There's
always a word on the river.</i>
Does it look like mine?
Yes.
Tomorrow I will not remember them.
That's why they will not forget you.
Watch the kids.
I will not forget you either.
We'll get warmed up.
Otherwise they will come
to the princes and ask:
Why have you folded your hand?
They are going for a long time.
They came up with something.
There!
There.
There.
Which day is today?
Friday.
I can not die on Friday.
Then it's Saturday.
Who makes them this way?
What is it? Close, but is it slippery?
Stop, you fool!
Hurry, Karkune.
We will not last long.
We will not pass.
We have to push ourselves.
Push! Come on! Come on!
Here we go! Here we go!
Shields!
Imagination, wounded!
Now I would ate a chicken soup,
what kind of mom was right.
Mum.
I am Marfinka...
pretty women.
Let me kill him.
Get out of my way!
U boj!
Close combat with a small machine.
Lord, give us strength!
In the line! Hold the machine!
Now! Left!
In a circle!
Here! Come here!
Dig!
Nestore!
Vidare!
What is it?
I can not take it away, it's
frozen, and we have no fire.
Breathe.
Breathe on the rope. Together
we'll breathe on the rope.
Breathe.
They laugh at us.
Find out what they want.
Big Kan wants to talk to you.
You, brave soldiers.
Big Kan asks, what do you want?
Nothing.
You came to us yourself.
You'll get it!
Then come and kill us!
Stones, here!
Everyone went and I went.
They found everything, and they found me.
This morning...
everyone will die, and I will with them.
I have not seen such a person yet.
Run away! They'll hit you!
Run away!
What are my grandchildren?
Good, is it?
The best.
It's amazing. We'll see you soon.
Core.
Core.
Core.
Core.
Nastja.
Lada.
Loved.
Vanja.
I remember.
I remember.
I...
I do not have 13 years.
I remember everything.
And now I will not forget...
Never.
Big Cann asks you when you are?
I'm a regular Russian soldier.
My name is Evpatius...
Kolovrat.
Get him...
...there will be a day,
when our all will take.
Take it.
You'll need it.
There...
and you kneeled.
If this was my soldier...
Keep it in the very heart!
Bury it with all honor, as
it suits the great knight.
<i>And Bato ordered that a stone grave
be erected in Kolovrat's honor.</i>
<i>On the high bank, where Evpatius
fought and died with his own daughter.</i>
<i>They ask, how many of us were?</i>
<i>A lot.</i>
<i>All those who fought with
Horde stood on that hill.</i>
<i>Shoulder to shoulder. Live and dead.</i>
<i>And now they're with us.</i>
<i>In one machine, they
stood to fight for the</i>
<i>truth, which the
Colovratus had given us.</i>
I heard you were a thousand.
Maybe a thousand.
And they say five thousand.
- We will not talk empty.
Come on!
This is music!
Together!
