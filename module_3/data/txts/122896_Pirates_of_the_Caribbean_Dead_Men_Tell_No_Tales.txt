Father?
Henry, what have you done?
I said I'd find you.
Look at me, son.
I don't care.
<i>There's no</i> place <i>for you
on the Dutchman.</i>
They know you're here.
Get home to your mother.
No!
Leave now!
Before it's too late.
I won't! I'll never stop.
And if you throw me over,
I'll come straight back.
Don't you see
I'm cursed to this ship?
That's why I'm here.
I think I know a way
to break your curse.
<i>To free you from the Dutchman.</i>
Henry, no.
I've read about a treasure.
A treasure that holds
all the power of the sea.
The Trident of Poseidon
can break your curse.
Henry, the Trident
can never be found.
I found you.
It's just a tale.
Like the tales of you
and Captain Jack Sparrow?
He will help me
find the Trident.
You stay away from Jack.
Leave the sea forever.
You have to stop acting like...
A pirate?
I won't stop.
I want you to come home.
Henry...
I'm sorry.
But my curse
will never be broken.
This is my fate.
You must let me go.
I love you, son.
Captain Jack Sparrow.
Keep even keel.
Haul in on the lee side!
Faster, you pathetic bilge rats!
You'll pump the bilge
and fill the scuppers.
We're chasing down pirates!
Henry, get back here.
You don't wanna get kicked off
another ship.
It's a Dutch barque.
Probably stolen
by the Pirate Bonnet.
My God.
I warned you
of leaving your post, boy.
I need to speak
with the captain.
- What did you say?
- Move!
Turner!
She's going in, sir.
Chase her down.
No, don't do it.
Don't do it!
You will
not address the captain, boy.
Sir, look at your charts.
I believe you're sailing us
into the Devil's Triangle.
You hear this, men?
This landsman believes
an old sailor's myth.
Sir, with all due respect,
I have spent my life studying
the myths of the sea.
I know every legend
and every curse.
And I know ships that
sail into the Triangle
do not necessarily sail out...
I'm sorry, sir.
This one is clearly disturbed.
Sir, trust in what I say.
Change your course.
You dare to give me orders, boy?
Arrest him!
Turner!
I will not let you kill us all.
This is treason.
No.
- Lock him up. We're going in!
- No!
Belay that starboard brace.
SOLDIER 21 Bind that line!
Stay to the chains!
This was
your last chance, Turner.
If it were up to me,
I'd string you from the yardarm.
On deck.
Hold steady, helmsman!
Jack Sparrow.
He's dead.
Buried in an unmarked grave
on the Isle of Saint Martin.
Sir,
there's something in the water.
Ship to starboard!
That's no ship, sir.
It's a shipwreck.
No.
She's sailing
straight toward us.
Open fire!
Open fire!
SOLDIER 13 Reload!
Secure the deck!
What are you?
Death.
Jack Sparrow.
Shh!
Do you know this pirate?
Only by name.
You're looking for him?
Is that a "yes"?
Yes.
For too many years,
the Triangle has cursed us...
condemned us
to this hell on Earth.
The key to our escape
is Jack Sparrow...
and the compass which he holds.
No need to fear me, boy.
I always leave one man alive
to tell the tale.
Find Sparrow for me...
and relay a message
from Captain Salazar.
Salazar.
Tell him I will behold
the daylight again.
And on that day...
death...
death will come
straight for him.
Would you say that to him?
Please?
Yes.
I wish I could
do it myself, but...
dead men tell no tales.
<i>Carina Smyth, you're
an orphan born of the devil...</i>
accused of
practicing witchcraft.
Before you die...
do you have anything to confess?
I confess that I'm not a witch,
that I am a woman of science.
I confess that
I have survived on my own...
with nothing but a diary from
the father I never knew...
and a quest for the truth
of who I am.
I confess that I will die
before I give up the search.
And I confess...
that while we've been talking,
I picked this lock.
Today, we dedicate
the Royal Bank of Saint Martin.
The most secure banking
institution in the Caribbean.
Our new vault
is five inches thick...
and weighs an imperial ton.
I've got her! I've got her!
Get her!
Don't let her get away!
Stop that witch!
Stop her! She's there!
Get out of the way!
Get out of my way!
With this bank...
the town of Saint Martin
enters the modern world.
- I'm so sorry, sir.
- The witch escaped her chains.
Find that wicked lass,
or you'll swing in her place.
Sir.
Sir.
No man nor an army...
can ever rob the gold
from Saint Martin.
Open the vault.
Pirate!
Pirates.
Pirate!
Hmm.
This may seem
a peculiar request...
but could someone explain
to me as to why I'm here?
Scrum.
How long?
No, wait, it's coming to me.
I need just a moment
to clear me head.
Make ready!
Present!
Hold your fire!
There's a woman with him
in the vault!
Never mind about that trollop.
Sir, I believe that's your wife.
Frances?
Right, I've got it.
I've got it!
I'm robbing the bank!
- Shoot him!
- Ooh!
Come on!
Pull!
Pull!
Come on!
That was not part of the plan.
After him!
Don't let him get away!
Yo! Come on!
Oh, oh!
Well,
I got this mutton, didn't I?
Oh, that was too expensive.
No woman's ever
handled my Herschel.
Clear a path!
Oh, no, no, no!
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Get inside!
Hard to starboard.
Sir.
Your celestial fix was off.
I've adjusted two degrees North.
Your map will
no longer be imprecise.
Although you will
have to start again with it.
You're a witch.
No, I'm not.
Am I a witch for having
catalogued over 200 stars?
Witch!
There is a blood moon coming.
I simply need to
purchase a chronometer.
I'll pay you double
for selling to a woman.
Help!
There's a witch in my shop!
Help!
Help! There's a witch
in my shop!
And a pirate! There's a witch
and a pirate in my shop!
Well, it's your lucky day!
Have either of the four of you
seen my bank?
Founding
Were you part of the plan?
I'm not looking for trouble.
What a horrible way to live.
Stop that witch!
Get her!
We're trapped. What do we do?
Yeah, there she is! Quickly!
You need to scream.
Over there!
Secure that woman!
You filthy pirate!
No need for name-calling!
Come on, lads!
Jack!
Huh?
Bridge?
It's empty!
Where is the dosh?
Do you think that
robbing a bank is easy?
You gaggle of gutless
heels of the womb's guilty...
of putting me in this dreadful
pickle in the first place.
Now line up
and offer me your tribute.
You want us to pay you?
Am I not the captain
of this ship?
You call this a ship?
Where's the treasure?
All of us are starving.
We will no longer follow
a captain without a ship.
I have a ship.
<i>Black Pearl</i> has
never left me side.
The pirate Barbossa
rules these seas now.
Has 10 ships, guns full.
Not to mention his cannonballs.
18 pounds each they say.
One-legged man
with 18 pound balls?
That's why he walks funny.
Oh, come, come, mates.
Did we not find the Treasure
of Macedonia together?
It was a troll of rotten wood.
- Gold of King Midas.
- Pile of donkey dung.
Face it, Jack.
Bad luck dogs you day and night.
Now that is
a blatant fabrication.
You've lost your luck.
You've lost your ship.
Now, you've lost your crew.
Jack Sparrow is
no longer our captain.
I'm sorry, Jack.
But we've reached
the end of the horizon.
Right then.
You're all dismissed. Eh?
All of ya, dismissed.
You'll never sail with
Captain Jack Sparrow again,
tell you that.
The whole town speaks of you.
The only survivor
of the Monarch.
A boy who paddled
all the way to Saint Martin
against the tide
on a piece of driftwood.
Found jabbering about pirates
and tridents.
Please, sir,
let me go of these chains.
My job is to protect
this island and these waters.
And your sleeves
have been ripped.
The mark of treason.
We were attacked by the dead...
You're a coward
who ran from battle.
And that is how you'll die.
I don't believe you're a coward.
Please leave me, sister.
I've risked my life
to come here,
to see if the rumors are true.
You speak of the Trident?
Who are you?
Tell me why you seek
the Trident.
The Trident can break
any curse at sea.
My father is trapped
by such a curse.
You're aware that curses
are not supported by science.
Neither are ghosts.
So you have gone mad?
I should never have come here.
Then why did you come here?
Because I need to
get off this island.
<i>- To solve The Map No Man...
- No Man Can Read.</i>
Left by Poseidon himself.
You've read the ancient text?
In each language
they were written.
But this map has never been
seen nor read by any man.
Luckily, I'm a woman.
This is the diary
of Galileo Galilei.
He spent his life
searching for the Trident.
It's why he invented
the spyglass...
why astronomers have
spent their lives
staring into the sky.
So you're saying
The <i>Map</i> No Man Can <i>Read</i>
is hidden in the stars?
It was left to me by my father.
He believed I could find
what no man has ever found
and I will not let him down.
Soon there will be a blood moon.
Only then can the map be read.
And the Trident found.
Who are you?
Carina Smyth.
If you wish to save your father,
you'll have to save me.
Find us a ship
and the Trident will be ours.
Turn to me, witch.
Hold.
He's gone!
He's gone, sir!
Find that coward.
He'll hang with the witch.
Move out!
Think
Captain Jack's washed up, eh?
I've not had a wash in years.
Check the alley down there.
You two, check the church.
The rest of you, with me.
<i>Bugger .</i>
May I please have a drink,
please?
Show me your silver.
Silver?
How about a trade?
Give me the bottle.
Capitan, what's happening?
Jack Sparrow.
Jack Sparrow has given away
the compass.
Daylight. Daylight.
We are free!
Now, now.
It's time to hunt a pirate.
Pirate's life.
Come to daddy. Oh!
Just the man
we've been looking for.
Why?
Why am I looked for?
Let it be known
that the pirate, Jack Sparrow,
will be executed at dawn.
Executed?
I will never set foot
in this town again, sir.
You mark my words.
Dead now, you cur.
I do mean it, you know.
I shall never be
back here again.
Huh.
"To release the power
of the sea...
"all must divide."
It's an island.
The stars lead to an island.
Look right here, sir.
Very good.
Take the rest to the cells.
I'm looking for a pirate.
Jack Sparrow.
Bugger off.
Psst. I need to speak with you.
Hand me your sword.
I don't have a sword.
What kind of soldier
has no weapon?
I'm currently wanted
for treason.
So not the very good kind then.
I'm looking for a pirate.
Captain Jack Sparrow.
Well, today is your lucky day.
'Cause I just happen to be
Captain Jack Sparrow.
No, it can't be.
I've spent years
searching for... this?
The great Jack Sparrow
is not some drunk in a cell.
Do you even have a ship?
A crew?
Pants?
A great pirate does not
require such intricacies.
Do you know how long I've been
waiting for this moment?
The risks I've taken to be here.
Are you sure
you're the Jack Sparrow?
Real question is, who are you?
My name is Henry Turner.
Son of Will Turner
and Elizabeth Swann.
Ugh!
You're the evil spawn
of them two?
Does mommy ever ask about me?
No.
Oh, go on.
She call my name in her sleep?
She never spoke of you.
Are you sure we're talking
about the same people?
He's a cursed eunuch.
She's golden-haired,
stubborn, pouty lips.
Neck like a giraffe.
And two of those wonderful...
Yes! Yes, it's her.
I need you to listen, Jack,
because at the moment
you're all I've got.
I found a way to save my father.
There is one thing
that can break his curse
<i>and free mm from the Dutchman.</i>
The Trident of Poseidon.
Ah.
The treasure to be found with
The <i>Map</i> That No Man Can Read.
Never heard of it.
There is a girl
inside this prison, Jack,
who holds that map.
The moon has turned to blood,
the Trident will be found...
and you could be the one
who holds the sea...
and with it become
all that you once were.
The great...
- Jack!
I'm so sorry.
Were you still talking?
I believe I nodded off a bit.
One more thing.
A message from someone you know,
named Captain Salazar.
I once knew a Spaniard named...
something in Spanish.
The Butcher of the Sea.
Him? No, no.
Quite happily, he's dead.
Very, very dead.
- Ship went down.
- Inside the Triangle.
He's coming for you, Jack,
to seek revenge as
the dead man's tale is told.
I don't believe you.
What did he say?
He said your compass
was the key to his escape.
An army of dead are coming
straight for you, Jack.
The Trident of Poseidon
is your only hope.
Do we have an accord?
Well, I'm not going
in there to tell him.
It was your idea.
No, it was my idea
for you to tell him.
He likes you more than me.
He doesn't like anybody.
Sorry, sir.
We know you said
never to disturb you.
Or to come in
without good cause.
Or to speak without first, um...
Asking ourselves...
Whether our thoughts
were absolutely necessary.
Like the time the ship
was on fire.
That being an example
of necessary thought.
Sir, again, we do apologise
for starting that fire.
Speak.
It's your ships, sir.
They're being attacked by
an enemy that takes no riches.
Kills without provocation.
My Ships?
Not possible.
Three have already
been sunk, sir.
They've been sunk by
a captain called Salamander.
Samovar.
Salazar.
That's it, your sirness.
He leaves one man from
each vessel to tell the tale.
The entire fleet
is being sunk...
and we'll soon be dead.
And quite possibly
out of business.
I'll be needing some time
with your witch.
I've been
expecting you, Captain.
Perhaps you'd like some tea?
I shall pass. Thank ye kindly.
The price of crossing my door
is blood, Captain.
That explains why
you're not so busy.
Everyone pays eventually.
Shansa, you and I
made a bond long ago.
I saved you from the gallows,
remember?
And I cursed your enemies.
But now you come to me in fear,
as the dead have taken
command of the sea.
And what would the dead
be wanting with me?
Not you, Captain.
They're searching for a Sparrow.
Jack?
Jack will sail
for the Trident...
with a girl and a Pearl.
The Trident can never be found.
The Trident is Jack's only hope.
The dead are conquering the sea,
unable to step on dry land.
Maybe you should retire
to the countryside.
You mean grass? On a farm?
Milkin' a cow, makin' cheese,
while they sink my treasure?
Ask yourself this, Captain.
Is this a treasure
worth dying for?
I'm a pirate.
Always will be.
So how do I save what be mine?
Jack held a compass
which points you
to the thing you desire most.
But betray the compass,
and it releases
your greatest fear.
A pirate's greatest fear
be Salazar, is it?
How did you get this?
I have my ways.
Lead them to Jack
before he finds the Trident...
and all your treasure
will come back to you.
Time to make a deal
with the dead.
Come on, pirate!
Hold On. Stop!
Dad?
Uncle Jack!
Jackie boy! How's it going?
Can't complain really. You?
I've been waitin' all morning
in here for a beating.
But the service is terrible.
Shameful.
Jack.
The oceans have turned to blood.
Best to stay on dry land
where it's safe.
I'm about to be executed
on dry land.
Good point.
Did I ever tell you
the one about the skeleton?
Yes, you have.
Many times, in fact.
Skeleton goes into a bar...
orders a beer and a mop.
Funny as ever.
Come on, let's go.
Oh, if they disembowel you,
ask for Victor.
He's got the softest hands.
- Thank you!
- And mention my name.
They won't cut your feet off.
Come on. You're up first.
And how would you
like to die, pirate?
Hanging, firing squad,
or a new invention:
the guillotine.
Guillotine? Sounds French.
I love the French.
Did you know that
they invented mayonnaise?
How bad could it be?
It's French, eh?
Oh, well, then.
I've changed me mind!
No, please!
Have mercy upon me!
I'm a bed-wetter.
Oh, come on.
I mean, I have to walk
upstairs as well for this?
Bring the basket.
Basket? Why?
Strap him down!
Here's an idea.
Here's an idea.
Why don't we try a good
old-fashioned stoning, eh?
I'd kill to be stoned right now.
Gets the crowd involved,
doesn't it?
I should like to speak
to Victor in Disembowelment.
I should like to speak to...
I'm not one
to complain normally,
but this basket's full of heads.
The final words of Carina Smyth.
Quiet!
The final words of Carina Smyth.
Good sirs, I'm not a witch...
but I forgive
your common dimwittedness
and feeble brains.
In short, most of you
have the mind of a goat.
Pardon me, sir.
Is it not common practice for
those about to be executed...
to be granted a last,
I don't know, something...
I believe I was making a point.
If you could just be patient.
No!
My head's about to be
lopped off, hence the urgency.
And my neck is to be broken.
Did you know that on occasion,
the neck doesn't actually break?
It just hurts.
- What?
- Oh, yes.
I've seen men swing for hours,
eyes bulging,
tongues swelling...
- revolting gurgling sound.
- May I finish?
No! You're lucky.
Wish I was hung.
- Kill the filthy pirate. I'll wait.
- But witches first.
I'm not a witch.
Were you not listening?
Quite hard to listen
when you have
the mind of a goat.
Enough! Kill them both!
Get another noose!
Did you think
you could defeat us, boy?
No, sir.
I'm just the diversion.
Fire!
Still rather be stoned!
Reload!
Ugh!
Thank you.
Die!
- Come here, you pirate scum!
- Hey, hey!
Oh, no.
What are you doing?
No, no, no!
Careful!
Horses?
Oh!
Thank you!
You're welcome, me lady.
Got you!
Knew you'd come
crawling back, traitor.
The Turner boy gave us
10 silver pieces
to save your neck.
From this moment on,
we are to be allies.
Considering
where your left hand is,
I'd say we're more than that.
We find the Trident together.
Do I have your word?
You're holding everything
but my word.
Then I bestow upon you
the honour of saving me
for a small donation.
You expect us to pay you
to save you?
Yes.
For a mere 10 pieces.
Madness!
We won't pay more than five!
Well, then... Eight it is.
Perhaps
we could discuss this later
as I'm having trouble
hoisting your port!
You are far from port.
That is my stern.
Are you sure?
Positive.
Well, look at this.
If I kill the coward,
the witch hangs.
Two for the price of one.
Please don't let go of me.
Might be difficult
once he kills me.
Gentlemen, these two prisoners
will lead us to the Trident.
Captain.
Do you really think
we can find the Trident?
Master Gibbs, you old worrywart,
there's nothing to be
concerned about at all.
What could possibly
go wrong, eh?
So this was your plan?
To be tortured
and killed by pirates.
You said you needed a ship.
You call this a ship?
Cut the shard!
Prepare to drown!
Me clear beloved crew,
finally, today is...
Something's gone wrong.
She floats!
Ship dead ahead!
Sir.
We would never question
your reason as a captain but...
But is there a reason...
as captain,
you've chosen to sail
in this unreasonable direction?
Tell the men to prepare
to be boarded...
to stand their ground
and show no fear.
Capitan, a ship sails toward us.
Capitan Salazar...
I hear you be looking
for Jack Sparrow.
Hold point!
And await orders.
My name is Captain Barbossa,
and I stand before you
with cordial intent.
Cordial intent.
Do you hear that?
This pirate wishes
to be cordial.
So let me show you
what my cordiality is, hombre.
Every time I tap my sword,
one of your men will die.
So I suggest that
you speak quickly.
Might want to go
a bit faster, Capitan.
Where's Jack Sparrow?
Jack be sailing for the Trident.
No, the sea belongs to the dead.
The Trident controls the sea.
No! No!
There's no treasure.
There's no treasure
that can save him.
He will die, as will you.
I be the only one
that can lead you to him.
I declare you shall
have Jack's life
by sunrise on the morrow...
or you can take me own then.
Do we have an accord?
Take me to him,
and you will live
to tell the tale.
You have my word.
I thank ye on behalf of me crew.
Well, hey, you can take
what's left of them.
The living come aboard!
Right, gentlemen.
Carina, we haven't
got much time.
The dead are sailing
straight for us.
Is that so?
Yes, I've spoken to them.
You've spoken to them?
Have you spoken to krakens
and mermaids as well?
Krakens don't speak.
Everyone knows that.
Of course.
I never should have saved you.
Last night,
there was a blood moon,
just as you described.
Tell me what it revealed.
And why should I trust you?
You trusted me
to hold your port, remember?
It was my stern. Clearly, you need to
spend more time at sea.
Tell me what you found
and I promise to help you.
I don't need any help.
Then why did you
come to me, Carina?
Why are we tied together
in the middle of the sea,
chasing the same treasure?
The moon revealed a clue.
"To release the power
of the sea, all must divide."
Divide? What does it mean?
I'm not sure yet.
Then we'll find out.
There is no map in this map.
Give me my diary.
<i>Give me The Map No Man Can Read.</i>
If you could read it,
<i>then it wouldn't be</i> called
<i>"The Map No Man Can Read."</i>
I beg you, please,
don't argue with her.
Most of the men on this ship
can't read.
Which makes all maps
The <i>Maps</i> That No Man Can <i>Read.</i>
Well, if you can't read it,
then you have no use for it or me.
Let me start again.
Show me the map.
I can't. It doesn't yet exist.
She's a witch!
I'm an astronomer.
Ah! Ah, she breeds donkeys.
What? No. An astronomer
contemplates the sky.
- Yeah, on a donkey?
- No! There's no donkey!
Well, then how
do you breed them?
Allow me
to simplify this equation.
Give me the map...
or I Will kill...
him. I'll kill him.
Go on then.
You're bluffing.
And you're blushing.
Throw him over.
Come. Come on.
- Come on.
- Come on. Come on.
We call this keelhauling.
Young Henry will be
tossed over...
and he will be dragged
under the ship.
All right.
What're you waiting for?
Uh, he doesn't appear to be...
- Zip, zip.
- Nope, not bluffing, me.
He's trying to say something.
No, no, we don't have
any food aboard. Sorry.
If he's lucky, he'll drown
before the barnacles
shred him to ribbons.
Barnacles?
Like a thousand knives
across your back.
'Course the blood
attracts sharks.
Sharks?
Shark off the bow!
I would say that swimming is
no longer his primary concern.
The map is there!
Where?
On the tip of your finger?
No. In the heavens.
That diary will lead me
to a map hidden in the stars.
Let him up.
I'll find it tonight.
Sorry, can't bring him up.
Look for yourself.
As I said... blushing.
Filthy pirate.
The sea has turned to blood.
A sailor washed ashore
talking about the Trident.
He was looking for Jack Sparrow.
The same pirate who saved
a witch from the gallows.
She's no witch.
But you are.
And you're going to help us.
You're afraid, Lieutenant.
As ships burn in the night,
you want to know
if you can save your own.
If the Trident is real.
You're going to read that wall
for me or you will die.
The British Empire will have
the Trident and rule the sea.
I want to know where
that pirate is going
with that witch.
Your destiny is in these stars.
I will set your course.
Spaghetti wolf!
Why did I bother coming to you?
The dead are hunting us down
and you do nothing.
Nothing!
You call this nothing?
You're drunk!
And you're sleeping.
My point exactly!
I am doing two things at once.
You can't save
the unsaveable, mate.
Like it or not, Jack,
you're going to help me.
I will break my father's curse.
Next time you raise a sword,
boy, be the last to die.
Oh.
Might I suggest you entice her
with a bit of flattery?
I'm here for my father,
nothing more.
I knew it.
Absolutely smitten with her.
Now, a bit of discretion
when courting a brunette...
never pursue her sister.
But if you cannot avoid
the charm of her sister...
kill the brother.
Savvy?
No, I do not savvy.
Who hurt you?
By the way, that little
sliver of knowledge
will cost you five pieces.
I'm not paying you for that.
Never say that to a woman.
Just because
you can't see something,
doesn't mean it's not there.
Like the map?
I have to find it.
It's the only link to who I am.
Who my father was.
So we've both spent our lives
searching for our fathers.
Perhaps you and I
are closer than you think.
The sun is up,
and so is your time.
Not to disagree,
but the precision
of our accord ends at sunrise.
This be but first light,
far from a fully risin' sun.
And I know you to be
a man of honour.
Honour? You know nothing of me.
I know what it's like to be
bested by Jack Sparrow.
He's an enemy to us...
You don't know who I am.
I've heard stories
of a mighty Spanish captain,
<i>El Matador Del Mar.</i>
A man who scourged the sea,
hunted and killed
thousands of men.
No, no, no. Men, no.
No, no, no.
Pirates, eh?
Pirates.
<i>Pirates had infected the seas
for generations.</i>
<i>Taking the life of my father
and his father before.</i>
<i>So I vowed to end this plague
once and for all.</i>
And that is what I did.
I destroyed dozens of ships.
The last ones joined together
to try and defeat me!
But they soon realised
it was hopeless.
<i>Nothing could stop
the Silent</i> Mary.
Hit them below the water line.
<i>Vamos! Vamos!</i>
Hang on, boys!
The sea was finally pure.
<i>Their wretched flags
would no longer stain the sea.</i>
They are begging for mercy.
Mercy? Mercy?
There's no mercy.
Make ready!
Please, help us!
<i>Adios!</i>
Fire!
It's up to you now, Jack.
This compass points towards
what you want most.
Never betray it.
The Devil's Triangle.
<i>The last of their ships</i>
<i>were burning before my eyes.</i>
And in that moment of victory...
it's when I heard it.
Hey! Hold on, Capitan.
One <i>Ship</i>
<i>was trying to escape
through the smoke.</i>
It's
a lovely day for a sail, innit?
And there, in the crow's nest...
there was this young pirate boy.
The way I see it,
there's just the two of us left.
You surrender to me now
and I'll let you live. Simple.
He stood there looking like
a little bird, eh?
And from that day...
he earned himself a name
that would haunt me
for the rest of my days...
Jack the Sparrow.
Right then. You surrender
to me now and I let you live.
I shall let you live.
This boy was mocking my power,
so I chased him...
knowing that I would
run my knife along his neck...
and when he was dead,
I would finish finally
with the pirate's life.
Follow him in.
To the gallows.
Grab some lines.
Prepare the bootleg. Portside.
Throw it now.
Bootleg turn.
What's all this?
Tribute, sir.
Ooh!
<i>He took everything from me...</i>
<i>and filled me with rage.</i>
And pain.
And here is where the tale ends.
<i>Not yet, Capitan. There!</i>
Found as promised.
So she's saying
she's got the map,
but she's the only one
who can follow it?
So we should shoot her?
Leave her be. She will
take us to the Trident.
You've been saying
that for hours.
Two things we know are true, eh?
- Yeah.
- Stars don't shine by day.
And she forgot the donkey.
How can we go to a spot where
no land exists on any map?
This chronometer keeps
the exact time in London.
I'm using it to make
an altitude measurement
to determine longitude.
Only then will we find
our exact spot at sea.
So you expect to find
the Trident with a timepiece?
Yes.
My calculations
are precise and true.
I'm not only an astronomer,
I'm also a horologist.
Mmm.
No shame in that, dear.
I mean, we all have
to earn a living, eh?
Oh, yeah.
No. No, I'm a horologist.
So was my mum.
But she didn't crow about it
as loud as you.
Are you saying your mother
was academically inclined?
More like,
horizontally reclined.
Horology is the study of time.
And she was always
looking at her watch.
I can vouch for that.
So no one can find the "X"
but you, right?
- No.
- And the donkey?
Ship to the aft!
Salazar.
Jack, the dead will not rest
until they get their revenge.
Dead?
No, no. The dead were never
part of this deal.
We should have never followed
a luckless pirate
and a witch to sea.
Right, that's it.
Kill 'em all.
Kill me and I'll be dead.
And then the other dead
won't be able to
have their revenge...
against me.
Being dead.
What?
Which will anger them
even more. He's right.
That's right.
Are all pirates this stupid?
Yes.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
What are we going to do?
As Captain, might I suggest...
Mutiny?
You had to suggest a mutiny?
Carina, the dead are coming.
Well, I choose not to believe
in supernatural nonsense.
Do you not see what's behind us?
Drop them. Drop them.
What are you doing?
The men on that ship
are looking for Jack
and Jack is on this boat.
So I'm going to swim for it.
How dare you do exactly
what I would do if I were you.
- Carina, stop that.
- No, no, no. Don't stop that.
This has gone far enough.
No, it has not.
Listen not to him.
Carry on. Carry on.
Why? She was almost finished.
I saw her ankles.
You'd have seen a lot more
if you'd have kept
your cake hole shut.
Kill the Sparrow.
Oh, that's not good, is it?
Keep rowing, man.
Faster. Faster.
No. That's it.
I'm going with her.
You would leave me for
some horologist in her knickers?
Yes.
You men are all alike.
Shark.
Henry!
Doesn't seem to be working!
No, we'll be fine.
We'll be fine.
<i>Vamos!</i>
How do they do that?
We have to swim for it.
I'll distract them.
Now!
Oh, shoo!
Go away!
Henry!
Oh!
Hi, Jack Sparrow.
Jack the Sparrow.
You're Spanish?
You're ghosts!
Oh.
They're unable to step on land.
<i>I</i> knew that, though.
Ghosts!
Carina!
You will soon pay
for what you did to me.
No, no, no. There's
no need to bother, really.
- Carina!
- I have no time to chat...
because me map's just run away.
I will be waiting for you!
Why would you be waiting for me?
Why would he be waiting for me?
Pirates!
Scrum.
Captain.
Jack always told me that
if anything should
ever happen to him...
he wanted you to be captain.
Yeah, but the men voted for you.
That's why you got
a captain's hat.
Be that as it may...
them were his wishes,
so be a good lad
and take the wheel.
And, uh, you...
take the captain's hat.
On.
This is the proudest
moment of my...
We will beat your captain
to death...
until he reveals
where they're heading.
Carina!
I know what's ailing you, boy.
You've got
the unscratchable itch.
Carina is the only one
who can help us
find the Trident...
and I'm not in love with her.
Love?
Who said anything about love?
What are you talking about?
The unscratchable itch?
Scabies.
I'm talking about scabies.
Small mites that burrow
under the skin.
It's certainly ailing me,
has been for years.
Oh, no.
Help!
Help me!
- Carina!
- Help!
- Henry, help me!
- Help her!
<i>By rule of the King,</i>
I sentence you all to death!
I think we should
tell each other
where our treasures
are buried...
just in case one of us survives.
Oh, good idea.
You go first.
My treasure is buried between
two crossed palm trees...
in an unmarked grave in Aruba.
What about yours?
I haven't got any.
You promised me Jack's blood!
But Jack be trapped!
He can never escape that island.
He's on land!
Hello.
I upheld our deal. Me men
and meself will go ashore.
The scurvy traitor
will be yours...
on me honour.
Honour? What honour, hombre?
What honour?
You don't know what honour is.
Spare me my life,
and I'll fetch you the Sparrow.
An accord?
Wake up, Sparrow.
Wake up, Sparrow.
Wake up, Sparrow.
It's time to pay your debt.
Pig... Pig Kelly?
Me old mate.
Mate?
You hear that, boys?
This lyin' pirate owes me
a plunder of silver...
and luck has brought him
to Hangman's Bay...
where he can settle his debt
here and now.
Oh, and I will. I will, Pig.
Name your price.
Her name is Beatrice...
and she's my poor,
widowed sister.
What is that?
She's been looking
for a respectable man.
But you'll have to do.
Louis, let's get on with this.
No! Why? Why would we do that?
To make
an honest woman of her, Jack.
Congratulations.
It's your wedding day.
Let us begin.
We'll honeymoon in the barn.
No, no, no.
Now, Pig, how could I...
honestly make
an honest woman out of it?
That... Her. I mean, her.
What are those things?
Our children.
Best not look them in the eye.
Bring the best man
and the bridesmaid.
I looked it in the eye.
Place your hand on the Bible.
I've got scabies.
- So do I.
- Ugh!
Place your hand on the Bible.
I'm a bed-wetter.
Say "I do..."
or I'll put a bullet
in your skull.
Jack, they're going to kill us!
- I don't care!
- Just say "I do."
- Last chance, Jack.
- Wait!
Surely, this is not legal.
This is not legal.
He's right.
Does any man here
object to these nuptials?
- I do.
- Congratulations!
You may kiss the bride!
No.
You like seafood, do you?
Come on!
Jack, we meet again.
Hector!
This is me bestest mate
in the whole world.
I always knew
you'd settle down eventually.
Did you bring me a gift?
That'll do.
You look marvellous.
Got quite the spring
in your step.
Has your leg grown back?
Uh, Captain, shouldn't we
be getting back to Salazar...
trade Mr Sparrow's life
in for our own?
Aye, that we could...
but I've come
for the Trident of Poseidon.
You're gonna double-cross
the dead?
You did promise.
And with it,
I'll gut the dead that stole
my command of the sea.
As much as I love this plan...
no vessel can outrun
that wretched hull of a ship.
But there be one, Jack.
The fastest ship I know,
the Pearl...
trapped in that bottle by
Blackbeard five winters ago.
By the power of that
blackguard's sovereign blade...
I hereby release the <i>Black Pearl</i>
to her former
and rightful glory.
Get ready!
Get ready for it!
It's coming!
It's coming!
It's coming, it's coming!
Stand aside! Stand aside!
It's coming!
It's shrunken.
Why doesn't it unshrink?
Maybe it's cold, huh?
She needs the sea.
She was a fine ship.
Let...
There be room
for only one captain.
Ooh!
Filthy beast.
Time to race the dead.
The only safe place is the land.
Why are we going away
from the land? Anyone?
Captain, your map is incomplete.
I can take us to the Trident
if you'd only trust me.
Anyone?
Did you not hear anything
I just said?
So you be saying that that star
is pretendin' to be a map?
Sir, there is
no island on any map
to support what the woman says.
Captain, you don't have to
understand her.
Just believe her.
Anyone?
If we had something sharp,
I could pick that lock.
You're not gonna find
anything sharp in here.
Keep still, you bilge rat.
Captain!
No, please! I don't wanna
be captain any more!
Release 'em!
Sir, you wouldn't allow...
a woman to steer your ship?
She will follow her star,
or we'll all die together.
<i>The Black Pearl!
She</i> sails <i>again!</i>
Come on, lads!
This ship, those ghosts...
There can be
no logical explanation.
The myths of the sea
are real, Carina.
I'm glad you can finally see
you were wrong.
Wrong?
Perhaps I had some doubts.
This is the worst apology
I've ever heard.
Apology?
Why would I apologise?
Because we've been
chased by the dead,
sailing on a ship raised
from a bottle.
Where is your science in that?
Fine, then I will apologise.
Go on, then.
Although one could argue
that you owe me an apology...
as my life has been threatened
by pirates and dead men.
Which you now believe in,
sorry to say.
Apology accepted.
I'm going to the lookout.
I'm glad you see it my way.
Twelve degrees to port!
- Ready the guns.
- Aye!
Ready the guns!
Those pirates are going
for the Trident.
Where did you
get that from, missy?
I know this book.
Stolen from an Italian ship
many years ago.
Stolen? No, you're mistaken.
There was a ruby on the cover
I would not soon forget.
This was given to me
by my father...
who was clearly
a man of science.
He was clearly a common thief.
The memory of my father
will not be defiled
by the tongue of a pirate.
This diary is my birthright.
Left to me on the steps
of a children's home.
Along with a name
and nothing else.
Oh, so you're an orphan.
What be you called?
Brightest star in the North
gave me my name.
That would be Carina.
Carina Smyth.
So you do know your stars.
I'm a captain.
I know which stars
to follow home.
Smyth.
Smyth is quite an unusual name.
Did we not once...
know someone called Smyth?
Shut your trap.
What was her name?
It's right on the tip
of me tongue. Oh!
Do you wanna lose that tongue?
Margaret Smyth.
Aye.
Should we make an accord then?
Or shall I tell you-know-who
what we both know to be true?
We both take this secret
to our graves.
You mean, it is true?
I was bluffing.
I'm not.
You kill me, you got nothing
to bargain the dead with.
So you need me.
I'll have to be frank, Hector.
You are very, very ugly-
So how could you produce
a fetching creature
such as that?
Margaret died.
I summoned as much honour
as a worthless blaggard
ever could.
I placed the infant
in an orphanage...
never to see her again.
I thought the ruby
might afford her
some ease in life...
but I never imagined
she'd take those scribblings...
and make a life of her own.
A life that's led her
back to me.
I'd say this puts me
in a rather favourable
position, Daddy.
You tell me what you want.
I want me compass.
216 barrels of rum.
And the monkey.
You want Jack?
Dinner. I want to eat him,
I want to eat that monkey...
No deal, Jack.
A clever young woman such
as that would never believe...
that a swine like me
could ever be her blood.
And the Trident will be mine.
Redcoats!
Redcoats!
Prepare to fire!
Prepare to fire!
Man that gun!
She comes starboard.
We shall fight to the last.
The <i>Pearl</i> will not be taken
from me again.
Sir.
Only the British Empire
will hold to
the power of the sea.
Whatever happens,
stay your course.
Jack Sparrow!
Jack Sparrow.
I've come with a butcher's bill.
Where is he?
Defend yourselves, men.
To the death!
Hurry up, man.
What did you sharpen it with?
Butter?
There's nowhere to hide.
Let's be brave.
Save the <i>Pearl!</i>
This has to be it.
It has to be here.
Find that land.
Or we'll all die.
We're nearly there!
It's here somewhere.
Oh!
Ow.
Ha!
Whoa...
Have you found what you're
looking for yet, miss?
I'm trying!
The stars will soon be gone.
Whoa! Whoa!
Carina!
Henry, look!
The island is there.
You found it!
The island.
Land.
Get to the <i>Mary!</i>
Carina!
Carina!
Henry!
They took Henry!
The Trident be all
that can save him now.
Then we have to find it.
Where is it?
It has to be here.
Look at it, Jack.
It's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.
This is what my father
wanted me to find.
The rocks?
No, not rocks.
Stars.
<i>This is The Map No Man Can Read.</i>
This island is a perfect
reflection of the heavens.
One star's missing.
Quickly!
We have to find the Trident
to save Henry.
Hector, I think you should know,
she's a horologist.
Why isn't it glowing?
Finish it, Carina.
The missing star.
For my father.
Aye.
Do it for him.
Look.
Poseidon's tomb.
This way.
Capitan, you know the danger.
Don't do it.
He has no choice.
Jack is on land
going for the Trident.
Capitan,
there must be another way.
Once you possess the living,
there's no coming back.
You will be trapped
in his body forever.
The Trident will set me free.
Time to kill a Sparrow.
No!
Look, Jack. There it is.
The Trident.
- Jack!
- Huh?
Huh?
You cut me,
you cut the boy, Jack.
Henry!
Hola, Sparrow.
Oh, no.
I hate the Sparrow.
Die, Sparrow.
Henry!
He's walking
on land. Please.
Henry, wake up.
Oh, piss off!
Whoa!
Henry, wake up.
He's killing Jack.
Henry!
Power of the sea.
What?
The power of the sea.
"To release
the power of the sea...
"all must divide."
If the Trident
holds all the power, then...
Then every curse is held inside.
As I told you before...
surrender to me now
and I'll let you...
live.
You want me to surrender?
Maybe.
This is where the tale ends.
No!
Shh.
Divide.
Henry!
Divide. Break.
Break the Trident and you'll...
<i>Break every curse at sea.</i>
All curses are broken.
We are flesh and blood!
The <i>Pearl!</i>
My <i>Pearl!</i>
Climb!
Move! Fast!
Hold it steady, boys!
Don't let her slip!
Jack!
Jump!
Faster!
UP! Anchor!
Get the anchor up! Quick!
Stop! Stop! Bring it up!
Bring it up! Bring it up!
Come on!
Bring it up!
Capitan!
<i>Capitan!</i>
Oh, crumbs!
<i>Whoa. Whoa.</i>
Oh!
I've got you!
Stronger.
Who am I to you?
Treasure.
Hold on!
Hector!
Hold her starboard!
Pirate's life, Hector.
You all right?
I don't know.
For a moment,
I had everything, Henry.
Now, it's all gone again.
It's not all gone, Ms Smyth.
Barbossa.
My name is Barbossa.
Maybe Jack was right.
About what?
The unscratchable itch.
What did you do that for?
Just checking it's truly you.
That you're not still a ghost.
It's me.
Then I was...
Wrong.
Slightly in error. Although...
Apology accepted.
<i>The Dutchman.</i>
<i>Hen“! -</i>
Yes, Father.
Let me look at you, son.
How did you do it?
How did you break the curse?
Let me tell you a tale.
A tale of the greatest
treasure known to man.
That's a tale I wanna hear.
What a truly revolting sight.
Make way!
Captain Jack Sparrow on deck!
Indeed!
Welcome back, Captain.
Oh, thank you very much.
Coming through.
Captain!
Thank you.
I remember you.
Sirs. Thank you.
Oh, good. Master Gibbs.
The ship is yours, Captain.
Ah, thank you.
Monkey.
Thank you.
What be our heading, Captain?
We shall follow the stars,
Master Gibbs.
Ave, ave, Captain!
I have a rendezvous
beyond my beloved horizon.
