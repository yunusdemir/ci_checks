<i>"It was a cold bitter wind,</i>

<i>"It blew through the trees</i>

<i>"It blew past the houses where</i>

<i>"It blew through the keyholes</i>

<i>"It blew down the streets</i>

- I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
- Oh! Oh!
What? I don't understand
what you're saying, man.
I said that I'm sorry.
$5,000 hand suit.
Hey! You don't say excuse me?
Come on.
Come on, We're late. Come on.
Did you see that?
He's a jerk. -I can't
believe he did that to me.
Forget about it.
Did you see what
he just did to me?
Yeah? You want to do
somethin' about it? Do you?
Yeah, I didn't think so.
- Don't worry...
- Would you stop touching me?
I'm sorry.
- Hey, hey!
- Hi, guys!
- Got the tickets. We're all set.
- Thanks a lot, Greg.
- See what I mean about him?
- What?
Look.
I don't even know why
we go out with them.
Hey, he's just in a bad mood, okay?
Come on. We're late.
No, no. I want to
get somethin' to eat.
Next.
Hey! I was waiting.
Well, I didn't see you.
Yeah, well, you see me now.
- No. She was next.
- Okay.
Was somebody talkin' to you?
Popcorns. One with no butter.
One with really,
really light butter.
Two medium diet Pepsis. Wait, a
second, how much is a large?
$1.75.
I only have...
I want to spend $10 in total.
So can I get a smaller size?
And she done made me miss
the beginning of the movie.
Shit.
Hey? Johnny?
- Johnny?
- Over here.
- Where? Where are you?
- Right here.
Ow.
Hey, where
the fuck is the popcorn?
- I'm standing in line, right?
- Uh.
And this chick walks
right in front of me.
Blows past me, like I don't
exist and goes to the counter.
What?
And I'm standing there like,
"Hey, there's a line here."
Yeah. -And she basically
says, "Fuck you!"
- That's fucked up, man.
- Yeah, I know it's fucked up.
Hate coming to movies around here.
Hate this whole neighborhood.
I mean,
she blows right past me.
What'd the girl look like?
What do you mean what
she looked like? I don't know.
What? You don't know
what the girl looked like?
No, I don't know what she looked like.
I didn't take her picture either.
She had curly
hair or something.
They have to talk about this right now?
It can't wait?
Hey, check this out.
Kenny told me about this.
- I gotta say something.
- You should.
Oh, shit, my brother's
got a truck like that.
He's got a truck
just like that, man.
Ay yo, what'd she say about me?
What? Who?
Right here, man. This girl, she
said something about me, man.
What the fuck
did she say about me?
I don't know what she said,
Johnny, okay.
I don't know what the other
girl looked like... -Shhh!
Hey, fuck you!
You're the one that fuckin'
should shut the fuck up, bitch.
Better turn your narrow ass around
and watch the motherfucking movie.
Pfft.
You want to move?
Come on. Let's move.
Thank you.
And it got hotter?
- Did you like it?
- Yeah, it was all right.
- Yeah.
- Let's use the elevator.
I liked it.
I was scared.
- Yeah, you like to be scared.
- Yeah.
Where we gonna get a beer? -Let's
go to that place around the corner.
Cool.
Yeah. Let's go.
<i>- I thought we were on three.</i>
<i>- No. No, we're here.</i>
Boy, those guys, huh?
Yeah.
Those guys behind us.
Yeah, I know.
You think I should
have said something?
What?
Should I go back in there?
They're probably gone by now. -You know,
I'm almost certain we're on three.
Oh, baby.
- You gonna go see? Thanks.
- Yeah.
Debbie?
Is everything all right?
What a night.
Hmm?
Debbie's been chowin' again.
Oh, God.
Two more weeks. Mmm-hmm.
I don't think so.
Aw...
Jesus Christ!
Money well spent.
I hate these guys.
Oh, God, you're so hot.
- You're so hot. It's okay.
- What's the matter?
She's burning up. She has a
really bad fever. Feel her.
- Will you get the, uh, thermometer?
- Yeah.
It's, it's in the second drawer.
I know where it is!
Oh, God. You're so upset.
- How much do we owe you, Debbie?
- 28 bucks. Please.
You know, maybe she has
another ear infection.
- Yeah?
- You should really call him.
Here. Twenty bucks. I will. I'll
ask him for the pink stuff.
One guess what he said.
Not to worry unless it's over 103 and he'll
phone a prescription in the morning.
- You got it.
- Same thing he always says.
- Yeah, he mentioned that too.
- He actually said that?
Why does he make us
feel like such idiots?
Did you tell him?
No, I didn't tell him.
- Have you seen my other watch?
- I think I lost it.
See what I've
been saying lately?
- Probably just left it in New York.
- Oh, yeah, right.
What do you want me to do?
Start accusing the world?
Pointing fingers,
conducting strip searches?
Well, things have been
missing lately, right?
I think that's
a sweeping statement.
And there have been a lot
of workmen in the house.
I mean, I'm not making any
accusations, but isn't it true?
I think we just mislaid
a few things, that's all.
God! Go run for congress.
I don't think you
love me anymore.
No.
Not for years.
Tell me you love me.
Why should I?
'Cause I want to hear it.
Hang on.
I'm thinking.
You are evil. Profoundly evil.
No.
I'm a nice girl now.
Yeah. Whatever
happened to the wild child?
I wonder.
Oh.
Why don't you come over here?
Why don't you come here
and sit down?
Say something, Annie.
Gee, it's my turn again.
<i>Harry? Harry, what's happening?
It's all right!</i>
Look, there's Bartholomew, see?
Right there.
He's in his window.
His hair is
blowing from the wind.
He's getting ready to fly away.
He's gonna fly over the town.
See?
Hey. Want to turn the page?
Want to turn the page?
Here. Let's do it together.
Ready? There we go.
Yeah. Yeah.
Who's that?
What color is he, huh?
He's red.
He's red.
<i>"The wind whistled past lampposts,
screamed over the lake,</i>
<i>"all in search of a boy</i>
<i>who was still wide awake.</i>
<i>"Bartholomew went to</i>
<i>the window and stared.</i>
<i>"He wasn't much drowsy</i>
<i>and wasn't much scared."</i>
<i>"He knew that old</i>
<i>wind was nothing to fear.</i>
<i>"With a bed sheet to</i>
<i>sail and a pillow to steer,</i>
<i>"he could ride that old wind</i>
<i>right into the night.</i>
<i>"Take off like a rocket,</i>
<i>a Bartholomew kite.</i>
<i>"But this would be no breeze,</i>
<i>it's safe to assume.</i>
<i>"Granddaddy of winds had blown</i>
<i>straight to his room."</i>
<i>Oh, God.</i>
What?
The power's out.
Don't move.
Either it'll come back on right
away, or it's gone for good.
All right.
We're waitin'.
Ah!
Check the circuit breakers.
Maybe it's just us.
Nope.
It's the whole neighborhood.
Really?
Mmm-hmm.
A blackout.
Fun.
Yeah. Hysterical.
Steph?
Is that you?
- Matt... Matt?
- Yeah.
Hey. Oh, sorry.
So, what do you
make of this, huh?
- Uh... Blackout? Oh, sorry.
- Do you mind?
Got any idea what caused it?
No. Seemed like a storm was
coming, maybe that was it.
Yeah.
Yeah, or Raji using those
weird power tools again.
Oh, Christ.
Hot pants. Here comes chuckles.
How are you, Mr. Schaefer?
How are you, Mr. Schaefer?
The power's out.
Jeez, we hadn't noticed, Rudy.
We were just tryin'
out our new flashlights.
One of you call it in?
Oh, I think they already know.
Well,
one of you should call it in.
Yeah, don't get involved, Rudy.
You never know what kind of
list you're gonna end up on.
That's almost funny.
Oh. Have one for me, will you?
Okay.
Hey, Sunday.
- Football?
- Oh, yeah.
- Don't forget to make your picks.
- Yeah, yeah.
- I mean it!
- Okay.
Hey!
Lock your doors and windows.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hey, Rudy!
What's that behind you?
- Oh! What?
- She's worse.
Her fever, it's worse!
- The power still out?
- Yes!
I think it's an ear infection.
I mean, she only wigs out like
this when it's an ear infection.
- Will you call the doctor?
- Okay. I'll call the doctor.
This isn't gonna work!
Wait.
Wait.
I'm gonna go
get the pink stuff.
- Did you talk to him?
- No, the phone's screwed up.
It's makin' this weird noise.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Oh, I'll get it, be back
in about 20 minutes, okay?
- Do you want anything while I'm out?
- Okay. Um, no. I'm all right.
All right.
Due to the power outage,
we cannot accept credit cards,
ATM cards or personal checks.
Use the smallest
bills you have, please!
Thank you!
You have no
right to do that! Come on!
Uh, he uh, he said he'd
call it in this morning.
Uh, the circuits are busy.
He'll keep trying.
Why don't you check back
in a couple of hours?
I know what it is.
It's amoxicillin...
In the pink liquid with
the little eyedropper.
Maybe you have a refill
on an old prescription?
- Yeah. Can you check the computer?
- No.
Look, um, if you can
just let me have it,
I promise I'll bring in a prescription
when the power's back on.
I can't do that, sir.
I could lose my license.
I, I understand.
I'm not saying that...
There are other people in line.
Yeah... Have you ever seen
a baby with an ear infection?
I mean, it's really painful.
They try and put their whole fist in their ear.
It breaks your heart.
Uh-huh.
You know, we're not talking
about morphine here.
It's penicillin.
So what do you want me to do?
I'm not a physician.
I can't prescribe drugs
and the law is the law.
Yeah, but you know me.
I don't know you.
What do you mean
you don't know me?
I mean I don't know you. You ask
me who you are, I don't know.
I've been coming here
since we moved here.
Over a year I've
been coming here.
What do you want
me to tell you?
I watched you fill this exact
same prescription three times.
It's on a little shelf five feet behind you.
How hard can it be?
Now, you're very insulting.
I'm not insulting you.
I don't like you.
You don't like me?
No. I don't.
Well, I'm not
trying to start a fight.
Would you just step
out of line, okay?
No! No, I am not gonna go home
to a sick child
without the medicine she needs because
of some asshole who hasn't got his...
I'll tell you what.
You get your skinny
little butt out of my store,
or I'm gonna push your face right
through the back of your head.
Oh, thank God.
You got the liquid, right?
- He wouldn't give it to me.
- What?
Oh, this idiot pharmacist.
God, this phone!
I got into a huge fight with the guy.
The doctor couldn't get through,
or something and so he can't
give me the prescription.
Legally, he can't dispense
without the prescription.
You know what he said?
He said he doesn't like me.
I mean what's that about?
He doesn't like me?
Matthew!
Her fever is out of control.
The phones are gonna
be back on soon.
Oh, you don't know that. I mean
we don't know anything right now.
Look, I, I tried the car radio
and all I got was static.
- I know. I know!
- All over the dial.
- Just give her to me, will you? Just...
- You don't have to yell.
You know, just give her a cold bath
like the doctor said we should...
I tried that. God, what do
you think I've been doing?
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna take care of it.
- No. I'll take care of it.
- How?
I don't need the diagnosis.
I have the diagnosis.
I just need someone to write
down the prescription, okay?
Look, I understand completely.
The problem is, Burnside and St.
Joseph lost their backup power,
so we have triple
the load we usually have.
She's in pain, all right. All
she needs is this prescription.
- As soon as possible! I promise, sir!
- Can't somebody, please?
- Please?
- I promise.
<i>Immediately</i>
<i>before you are towed.</i>
<i>Move immediately. You're blocking
the entry by emergency vehicles.</i>
Excuse me. I need help over here.
My mother...
Ow!
<i>Hello. Hello...</i>
I'll be back to pick
you up in 10 minutes.
Matt!
The store will be
closed in 30 minutes.
No, you calm down. I've been writing
checks in here for 17 years.
Out of stock crap!
- Have to check that.
- Yeah.
Hey! Hurry up.
Oh, Mr. Pharmacist.
Hey!
Come here.
That guy! Stop him!
- Damn!
- Sir, we have a problem here.
- No problem.
- Hey, hey, hey!
Son of a bitch!
Move aside!
Get out of the car!
3-H-O-O-Q-Q... Aw, shit!
What is the matter with people?
- Is she asleep?
- Yes.
Good.
Honey, I'm really sorry
that I was a bitch before.
- You weren't.
- Yeah, I was.
Well, at least the phones
are working again, huh?
No.
Well,
they got the prescription.
Not exactly.
Well, then, why'd
they give you the stuff?
They didn't... Give it to me...
Exactly.
What do you mean?
What do you think I mean?
- Matthew!
- Mmm-hmm.
- You stole it?
- Mmm-hmm.
Oh, my God.
- You didn't hurt anybody?
- Mmm, no.
- Did anyone recognize you?
- I don't think so.
I don't like this.
Well,
you like something about it.
- Right here?
- Mmm-hmm.
What, what, what?
There's uh, somebody outside!
- What?
- There's somebody outside.
- He's looking right in the window.
- Where? Where?
Wait here.
I, I didn't watch you
guys makin' out at all.
What are you doin'
sneaking around out there?
- The bell doesn't work.
- Hey, Joe. How are you?
- I told you to stay back there.
- Oh, sorry, Sarge.
Your mail sucks.
Oh, let me get this.
Don't you guys have
any idea what's goin' on?
Yeah, it's a blackout, right?
- You mean didn't hear? You don't know?
- Know what?
The Martians have landed. They want our women.
Watch her like a hawk.
Did you find
anything out or what?
Well, you know I got
my own theory, but uh...
A guy across the hall says that a meteor
landed in the preserve last night.
But he's lied to me before, so
I don't know if that's true.
- Don't smoke in the house.
- Mmm-mmm-mmm.
No, I'm not. I'm not.
And the guy in line at the Food King said
there was a meltdown at Indian Point.
And the uh, the checker
at the Food King said...
Said that uh,
he saw the meteor.
But that's not our problem. Our
problem is our grid's screwed up.
Okay, so, how come
the phones don't work?
I don't know.
Their grid's screwed up too.
So that's all you got?
Rumors from the Food King?
Hey, how am I supposed to know?
How am I gonna know, huh?
This is such a drag!
Well, not for me.
And now I got the day off.
So what's goin' on?
I mean, really?
I don't know,
people are freaks, man.
I heard all this stuff about
looting and shootings last night.
Wow. People were killed?
- That's what I heard, yeah.
- Well, I don't believe it.
Well, I do, if it's anywhere
near where I used to work.
How many?
I heard a lot of different numbers.
They're not small numbers.
We don't know anything for certain, right?
I mean, this is just talk.
Right. So let's go find out.
You want to go out there?
Unbelievable.
These people are crazy.
You know, Joe, if you want, you can
come back and stay at our place...
You know, until
the power comes back on.
That's okay.
Thanks though.
I'm just saying, you know, if you don't
want to go home and be by yourself...
Well, if he doesn't want to...
I'm just offering. -Yeah, but
he said he doesn't want to.
Come on! It'll be fun!
You know, it'll be
like camp or something.
Right?
We'll uh,
get drunk in the dark.
It's not a big deal.
Well, if you want me to.
And you don't mind?
Why would I?
- Come on!
- Fucking move your car!
Sixty-two bucks? That's all we have
from the three of us? This is pathetic.
We got a box of change in the closet.
There's probably 50 bucks in there.
I got a whole bottle of tequila, but
the scotch situation is very grim.
Well, cash is the problem. ATMs are all down.
No one's gonna take Visa.
- We don't need much money.
- Yeah, we gotta buy stuff.
- We need batteries. Ah!
- We got batteries.
And water, we gotta
buy diapers and candles.
And a gun.
Are you crazy?
Hey.
Unless you have one, I don't.
A gun?
Hey, everybody, just relax.
It's not like I'm gonna take it
out and kill anybody with it.
You wanna buy a gun? No, no.
We should talk about this.
No, I hate guns. You hate guns.
I know,
but let him make his point.
I don't like guns either.
But let's not be idiots here.
Power's out. TV, phones.
I mean, come on. Do you remember
a situation like this, ever?
I'm just saying, it makes sense
to take some precautions.
I think you're right.
I was thinking the same thing.
I didn't want to say anything 'cause
I know how you feel about guns.
How we feel
about guns, remember?
You know what it is, Annie,
it's about not being naive.
You've never shot a gun.
- Yeah... Yeah.
- It's not that hard.
- Come on. Let's not!
- We were just talking.
As a favor to me?
Please? God.
Come on, baby.
Okay, let's go.
- Really?
- It's my house too.
All right, stud.
What about money?
We'll think of something.
I'll drive. -All right.
Be back in a half hour.
I knew it.
I knew it.
I knew it.
Daddy's being a jerk.
Boys will be boys, huh?
Boys will be boys.
Hey!
Watch what you're doin'!
Cash only. Fifteen day waiting
period on all handguns.
So, don't ask me about the handguns.
Forget about the handguns.
We're out of 12-gauge shells
and all ammunitions
for .22s, .38s and .45s,
unless you want hollow point.
You want hollow point?
We got that for .38s only.
So, what'll it be?
Hey, I got a quick question.
- You handle it.
- I have this gun...
Why me?
'Cause you're in construction. You're
better at this kinda stuff than I am.
Huh.
Come on, fellas, we got the
whole world waitin' behind you.
Hold on. Hold on. We're ready.
Next, please.
We're just lookin' for
something for home defense.
Of course you are.
How much cash do you have?
- We've got this.
- That's a $600 watch.
I'll give you $300 credit.
Now, what I recommend, 12-gauge,
pump-action Wysler guardian.
Blue-steel barrel,
wood-grain stock.
Extended tube for
an eight-round capacity.
A 12-gauge is a good gun.
A 12-gauge a house gun.
Got a big bang,
got a big pattern.
You don't have to be a genius
to hit something.
Eighteen-and-a-half-inch barrel.
Shortest barrel legal in this state.
But if you feel your personal safety requires
something a bit more easily concealed,
go across the street to the hardware
store, get yourself a hacksaw.
Even throw in a box of shells.
You said you were
out of 12-gauge shells.
Uh, okay, fine, my mistake.
Well, that's the deal, gentlemen.
$300. You want it or not?
- $300? The tag says $95.
- Yeah.
All prices are triple.
What? Are you kiddin' me?
Look, pal, you're
the one that comes in here
to try and buy a shotgun
in the middle of the blackout.
And don't take the moral
high ground with me.
You want the gun? You want the watch back?
Take your pick.
I'm a licensed carpenter's foreman.
I'm not "in construction."
You think you could
keep that straight?
Come on, man I don't
mean anything by that.
Maybe it's all the same
to you, it's not to me.
Ohoh. -And I'd like
to know what the fuck
the fact that I build houses has
to do with buying weapons, man.
You're better at bargaining
and that kinda stuff.
You're so full of shit.
Look, I'm not going to stand here holding
this incredibly impressive weapon...
And have an insipid argument with you.
I'm not gonna do it.
Well, maybe I didn't make
$100,000 last year... -Down, Joe!
That was close.
Man, once the money comes in,
just a matter of time, huh?
I have treated you exactly
the same way for 15 years.
Yeah, like a 17 year old.
The car. Open it.
So, just tell me, okay, for
the record, just so I know.
What were you
trying to say in there?
Well, actually it was a
compliment if you think about it.
- Yeah? How's that?
- Yeah.
Well, you're always telling me how you
have to deal with subcontractors, right?
And all these
fights you get into.
Every day you deal with an element
of society that's more...
- Well, that's more...
- Primitive.
- Well...
- You mean, like uh, animals.
Yeah. Yeah, Joe, like animals.
That's what I mean. Like monkeys.
That's what you are.
- Like a big ape in a zoo.
- It's not a joke.
Yeah, heavy in the forehead.
- I'm not laughin'.
- A real knuckle-walker.
Well, your wife doesn't mind havin'
a knuckle-walker around, does she?
Now why do you want to say
something like that for?
Well...
It's just shit, you know.
The shit hits the fan and then suddenly I'm
welcome in this perfect family's home.
And that hasn't happened
a whole lot lately, has it?
Yeah, you don't have
a lot of nights free.
You jealous, Matt?
Are you?
Monopoly?
Takes too long.
Life?
Nobody plays Life anymore.
Yeah, they do. -I don't
feel like playing a game.
- Oh, come on. This is supposed to be fun.
- Scrabble, Matt?
Oh, that's too educational.
Ugh. Do we really need that fire?
It's like I'm burning up.
I like the light.
Want to try and
keep your clothes on?
I'm sorry.
What is that one game,
you know where you gotta
give away your secrets?
We played that once,
Matt, remember?
I'd rather stick my
tongue in a fan, thank you.
We'll pretend like
we're in high school,
and we gotta tell everyone who
we wanted to fuck real bad.
- Really?
- Really.
Or how...
Or where.
How is the wine?
Insufficient.
Then I guess Twister's out.
No, I wouldn't say that at all.
Get away from me. Go on.
Get outta here. Go on.
Matt.
How much butter do we have?
It's all melted.
This is not my beautiful wife.
You used to like
my checkered past.
Checkers.
We could play checkers.
That's a two-person game, Joe.
I need another drink.
Think so?
Yes, I think so.
I know I do.
Is he mad?
Oh, he's a big boy.
He can say so if he is.
God, it's like I can't
have any fun anymore.
- I got it.
- Oh, excuse me.
- Hey, that's a nice picture.
- Oh.
- What? It's funny. I like it.
- Yeah.
You know, the guy you got doin' your
house is really doin' a number on you.
Oh, I know. He's terrible.
Could have saved you
a lot of heartache.
Mmm-hmm.
No, no, no. I know.
So, uh, how's Carol?
I heard she's fine.
That didn't take long.
Long enough.
You know, there is this
thing called marriage.
That's one step
closer to death.
You know what your problem is?
That's a question I've been
hearing a lot lately. I wonder.
You have too many options.
Now, that's
a matter of perspective.
I hate you.
Really?
It's down there.
He did.
- No, we don't. Damn it.
- Yeah, well...
No, see, when I get upset,
my stomach gets upset.
Oh, you're a pussy.
Hey, what's so funny?
Hey, Dad's here.
Matt, you want a drink?
All right.
Great. Run out and loot us
some scotch, will you?
You told him?
- Oh...
- What?
You told him!
I'm sorry. I didn't know
that I wasn't supposed...
So, when you're out looting tomorrow,
I'm a 40 regular, love cashmere.
- Single breasted...
- Shhh!
Okay, okay.
Looter.
I'm not a looter, Joe I took what
I took to fill a specific need.
So did the guy
that took the TV.
TV is not a necessity. -It is
if you sell it for food, Matt.
God, you know, I'm sorry. I
interrupted something here, you know.
And so I'm gonna go back...
- No, of course not. We're just...
- Yeah, you did.
See, we were talkin' and I
think that your wife thinks...
Wait a minute.
Are you, are you actually going
to stand here in my kitchen...
And tell me what
my wife is thinking?
- Who the fuck do you think...
- Boys.
If you can't play nice, we're not gonna
have any more of these sleepovers.
I'm gonna go, uh, outside
and have a smoke, all right?
Matt, I'm sorry if...
Don't.
Good night.
Good night.
Shit.
- Matt?
- Hmm?
- There's someone in the house.
- What?
Where's the gun? -It's in the living room.
Who's in the house?
No, it's not.
Where the fuck is the gun?
- My God, what's going on?
- Annie, where's the gun?
Uh, I threw it in the pool.
Why?
Why'd you do that? -Annie,
there's someone in the house.
What? Somebody
broke into the house?
- What?
- I got a bat underneath the...
Oh, my God.
Stay here.
- Ready for this?
- Yeah.
He's just a little guy.
I'm gonna go around.
You go this way.
He's got our money.
Joe?
- Leave the stuff!
- Turn the fuckin' alarm off!
- I said leave the stuff!
- Leave it!
Turn it off! -Get outta here!
Get outta here!
- You see if he has a gun?
- Joe, does he have a gun?
I don't know.
Oh, God!
Hey!
Don't get too close to him!
Joe! Look out!
Use your knife! Use your knife!
- You okay? You all right?
- Yeah.
Matt? What happened?
- I stabbed him.
- You stabbed him?
I think he's still alive.
No, I think I killed him.
You all okay?
Huh? How about you?
Get a towel or blanket.
Something to stop the bleeding.
He's a little guy.
Yeah. That's some
wicked switchblade, huh?
- You knew he only had a knife?
- Yeah.
What?
Hey. Hey, why?
- What'd he mean by that?
- Is he dead?
- Yeah.
- We don't know that.
Hey.
We're gonna have
a big problem if you don't
have your head
screwed on straight.
I'm tryin' to save this guy.
That's not important right now!
The guy's dead, okay?
Oh, my God.
Take Sarah inside.
- Oh, my God.
- Please, take her inside.
It's, it's Richard.
Who?
The guy who works for Mr. Alvarez,
the guys fixing our kitchen.
Matthew, it's, it's Richard.
That's your watch.
Please, take her inside.
- You hear that?
- What was it?
- A shot, wasn't it?
- A shot?
It sounded like it was up here.
You sure?
It was definitely a gunshot.
It sounded like it was
right outside my window.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
- He tried to stab me.
- I saw it. I saw it.
I think it's that
fellow Matthew's place.
I had to protect myself, right?
Matt? What happened?
Uh, somebody
broke into our house.
And, uh, Steph came
out with a rifle...
And, he, uh...
Yeah, and this guy was waving
this gun around.
He was about ready to shoot
one of these guys here.
Like Matt said, I come out of
my house with my hunting rifle,
and I shot him... First.
There was nothing else
I could do. I mean...
He was about to take
a shot at you, wasn't he?
- Uh...
- Well, wasn't he? I mean...
You gotta tell them
what happened.
The guy was aiming
a gun at you.
You got nothing to worry about.
Aw, Jesus Christ.
Hey, I'm glad you guys are here, man.
The guy is dead.
- I come out of my house...
- It is what it is.
He's got his hands in the air.
He had this gun. Hold on.
Stop right there.
We heard a gunshot. I want to know who fired it?
You telling me that was you?
Well, yeah, but,
what I'm trying to say is...
Calm down
and tell me what happened.
Okay, I come out of my house,
and I had a rifle.
This guy's got his hands in the
air, and I fired, just once...
Just to put him down on
the ground, you know.
To take the gun away from him.
- And he stabbed him.
- He probably saved my life.
Yeah. Maybe.
Where were you, sir?
Uh...
I was standing over by the
edge of the driveway.
Is that how you saw it?
Uh, I didn't hear
what he said, so...
- Yeah, well, I was telling him how the guy...
- Just a second, sir!
You guys stay here. Come here.
Huh? Oh. S-T-R-A-S...
I think, under the circumstances,
we can save you a lot of time
and just return what he took
from you right now.
What's gonna happen? -There
will be an investigation.
Don't worry about your neighbor.
He'll stand up just fine.
The guy was breaking into houses. You all
saw him with a gun and the blackout.
- They'll consider that.
- Yeah.
Is it bad out there?
Out where?
"It'll take an hour,
and the lights will be on."
Who in hell are
they trying to kid?
- That not what the cop said?
- That's what the cop said.
Upstairs. Go on!
No, he said there was a chance
that it'd go on in an hour.
They don't know any more about when
the power's going on than we do.
Solar storm. How gullible
do they think we are?
Look, it doesn't
matter what happened.
What are we going to do to protect ourselves?
That's the question.
We should have gated the
street when we had a chance.
Gates.
Well, we wouldn't have had
this problem now, would we?
You know sometimes I just
don't understand you people.
I really don't.
I don't wanna live behind bars.
And I don't understand
why you can't see that.
The important thing is that
we all stick together.
Fifteen hundred lousy bucks...
Does anybody have any information?
I mean not a rumor.
Not something they heard from
a friend of a friend
of a brother,
but hard information?
We could, um... We could park
a couple of cars, you know.
Um, at the end of the block,
seal it off.
That's a good idea.
How about that Lincoln of yours?
That's a good hunk of steel.
- Oh, you thought my Lincoln?
- Yeah. Why not?
Well, I don't really want to run
down there and move it all the time.
- Leave the keys in it.
- You insane?
What are they talking about?
I'll tell you
what I want to talk about.
I want to talk
about Raji's generator.
- Hey!
- You got a generator?
- Well, yeah, but...
- Why didn't you tell us?
Why should I?
That's the kind of thing
we should all know about.
I mean, what if some of us have
some kind of an emergency?
I have a very limited
amount of gasoline.
Everybody can use
their own gas, Raji.
- Look, you don't understand.
- It's a very small generator.
- Blah, blah, blah.
- "Blah, blah, blah," what?
Look, look, I don't know how they
do things where you come from...
- Miami.
- What?
I come from Miami, okay?
What are you saying, Raji? If one of
us has an accident, we can't use it?
I didn't say that. -Some
of us have kids, you know.
- We have kids.
- How many?
- Two!
- Well, we have three.
- So what?
- I'm just saying.
Look, the important thing
is that we all stick together.
Good night everybody.
Right, Raji. Stick together.
Yeah, but not with your
generator and not with his car,
is that about the size of it?
Who the hell is he?
Matt?
Hey, Matt.
Matt, come here. I just
wanna tell you somethin'.
Come on.
Take her in.
So what'd you tell the cop?
Doesn't really matter, does it?
It kind of matters to me,
don't you think?
I lied... Through my teeth.
Thanks, man.
They'll pull
the registration on the gun.
They'll trace it to you.
- There was no registration on that one.
- What do you mean?
I won it in a card game.
You won it in a card...
Congratulations.
Hey... Whoa,
whoa. Easy, easy. Come on.
- I just want to ask you something.
- What?
Where do we stand, you and me?
I mean...
Do we have a problem now?
Okay, I see.
I see how we're
gonna play this.
Good.
I'm right across the street,
you know.
What about your
parents' place in Colorado?
How do we know
the power's not out there too?
Well, we don't. It's
gotta be better than here.
- It's really far.
- It's not that far.
We've driven it before. -Why
do you guys want to leave?
It's a little different
for us. We got a kid.
- So, you just want to run away?
- It's not running away.
What's the matter with you? -There's
nothing the matter with me, Joe.
It's not safe here.
I just saw a guy get
killed in my driveway.
I sure am sorry about that. It
must be a real strain on you.
That's not what I meant.
Believe me,
it's 10 times worse for me.
I'm sure it is.
I'm not saying that.
You should just be grateful you
didn't have to get your hands dirty.
No, wait a minute. Let me
make this clear, all right?
I feel good about what I did.
I acted, Matt. Me and that guy
across the street.
And you, and you and your baby are
probably alive because I acted, okay?
If that's the way you see it.
How do you... You know what?
- Tomorrow morning I'm just going to get lost.
- No, no, we're all leaving.
All right? All of us.
I heard you get up.
Do you want to be alone?
I couldn't sleep either.
What are you thinking?
Nothin' good.
<i>Your folks' place</i>
<i>is 530 miles from here.</i>
<i>We can make it in a day</i>
<i>if we drive straight through.</i>
<i>We should take my truck.</i>
<i>It's got four-wheel drive.</i>
<i>You never know if</i>
<i>we're gonna need it or not.</i>
<i>If we can keep up 20</i>
<i>or so miles a gallon,</i>
<i>that means we'll need 26 gallons
of gas to get us there.</i>
<i>My tank holds 14.</i>
<i>And we can siphon some</i>
<i>from the other two cars.</i>
<i>Keep a can in the trunk.</i>
<i>But that means</i>
<i>somewhere along the way,</i>
<i>we're gonna need</i>
<i>another seven gallons of gas.</i>
<i>Gas stations</i>
<i>aren't gonna be open.</i>
<i>Even if they are,</i>
<i>they won't sell it to us.</i>
<i>And even if they would,</i>
<i>we couldn't pay.</i>
<i>But along the way, we're gonna have to get
our hands on seven gallons of gasoline...</i>
<i>Somehow.</i>
Hey! Joe!
Come on, man. Let's go!
They're not gonna work. They
were at the bottom of the pool.
It's okay. It's okay.
That was nothing. That's okay.
- Some of 'em work.
- Yeah.
It won't do us any
good if we don't bring it.
Hey, do you mind if I drive?
Uh, yeah, kind of.
Come on. It's no big deal.
You drive your car. I'll drive my car.
How's that sound?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I don't suppose you have anything cold?
- No, I'm sorry. We don't.
- Uh, all right. Three sodas, please.
- Sure.
Oh, I am so
tired of it being hot.
I'm tired of this whole deal.
Uh, two cheese sandwiches,
two warm Pepsis.
I wish we could
do better for ya.
Thanks.
Come on. Hurry up.
- Excuse me.
- You bet.
Hey, uh, could I get
a glass of water, please?
Excuse me.
Uh, listen, I've got a problem.
I need some gas.
You think I can get some gas from you people?
What do you say?
- You kiddin'? Our gas?
- Yeah.
I'm kiddin'. I'm a joker.
How ya doin'? Name's Gary.
- Raymond.
- Good to meet ya, Raymond.
Yeah.
Listen, do you know
anything about cars, Ray?
Nope.
Oh, shit. I'm having a
little problem with my, uh,
fuel pump or I
don't know, something.
So, you don't
know anything at all?
Sorry.
- Can you spare a little gas maybe?
- Can't do it.
I'll give you 10
bucks for a gallon.
I said I can't.
You can't spare
one gallon of gas
for $10?
That's right.
Well, that's bad business, Ray.
- How about your friend here? He got a car?
- We're together.
I guess I'm just
shit outta luck, huh?
- Didn't say that.
- Yeah, you did.
Hey, uh, where's your John at?
In the back.
Somebody's in there right now.
Well, sorry.
Who is it? The Pope?
They'll be out in a minute.
You know what, Raymond.
I just don't think
we're ever gonna be friends.
Free ice cream.
Come on, folks.
Get your ice cream.
We don't really need ice cream.
I do.
- Hi.
- Hi. Know what you want?
Um... -I'll have chocolate chip.
If you got it.
I will have a vanilla cone
and a chocolate cone.
Slow down!
Hi. Could you,
uh, watch her for a second?
- Yeah.
- Thanks.
I'd like two cups.
One vanilla...
- One for me?
- And one strawberry.
Thanks.
- Vanilla and strawberry.
- Thank you, sir.
You ready?
- Look at that.
- What?
You live in the middle of nowhere
and your house is a piece of shit.
You don't fix it up? You
buy a BMW instead? -So?
- So who would do that?
- Those people.
It's not their car, Matt.
Oh, no, actually
it's their son's car.
Yeah, you see, he went to the
city with nothing. Made millions.
What are you talking about?
Yeah, he comes back
to the house.
Comes back to help his aged and frightened
parents in this terrible time of trouble.
- Mmm-mmm.
- Yeah.
Try this one. BMW guy
comes running out of the city,
like us, like everybody.
Runs out of fuel,
no shelter, no food.
Sees this farmhouse. Pulls up,
waits, breaks in, kills the farmer.
Holds the wife hostage
for a couple of years.
- Lives off their stuff.
- Kills the farmer?
- Why not?
- Let's go, you guys.
We're low already?
No, it's just safer in the
tank than in the trunk.
Why don't you check the gauge in that car?
See if there's any gas we can siphon.
Yeah. That's a good idea.
- No VIN number.
- What?
Little metal identification
tab has been cut out.
Oh! Ow! Sorry! Sorry.
What is it?
- There's a guy sleeping in the car.
- What's going on?
Nothing. I startled
this guy. That's all.
- What guy?
- That guy.
Hey. How ya doin'?
- Hello.
- Hello.
What happened?
Boom. That's what happened.
Engine blew up on me.
Hell, I've been out
here all day long.
I swear to God I couldn't get anybody
to stop for me to save my life.
I just gave up.
Went into the car,
must have dozed off.
- You come from the city?
- Yeah, I did.
You scared the hell out of me.
Yeah, likewise.
Hmm. Hey, uh, uh...
You think maybe I could
catch a ride with you guys?
Uh, well, we're...
Hi! How ya doin'?
- Hi.
- Hi!
Cute. Huh.
Uh...
You got any room in there?
You see, you really
would be saving my life.
So, uh...
Come on. What do ya say?
Well,
the fact is, we're full up.
Oh, now.
You sure?
I think so. Yeah. -Yeah,
I'm really, really sorry.
How about you?
- You think so too?
- Uh...
Gee, it sure must have
been hot in that car.
'Cause, you look like you've
been swimmin' in a pool.
Funny thing is, I did the
same thing this morning.
Dove in the pool and got the...
Remember?
Know what I mean?
Yeah, he's right. We can
barely fit the four of us.
Sorry to hear you say that.
You know what.
Let me see what I can do.
I'll move some things around,
maybe make some room.
Yeah. Yeah,
I'd appreciate that. Thanks.
- What are you doing?
- Just hold on, Annie.
Hey, I'll just go
and get my stuff, okay?
I'll be right back.
- He's got a gun?
- That's right.
A gun.
He's got a gun. Oh, my God.
- Shit.
- Keep your shirt on.
It's gonna be all right. Shh!
Is everything all right?
- Yeah!
- Talk to him, Matt.
Just stay between him and me.
Didn't change
your mind, did you?
- Do it, Matt.
- Everything okay?
- What should I do?
- Get on the floor.
Stay down. Uh...
Yeah, I think it's gonna work.
We're gonna put some
stuff on the, on the top
and it should be all right.
- Hey!
- No! Don't!
You shot him!
- Goddamn you!
- Matt?
Damn you!
- Annie?
- Why'd you do that?
Why in the hell did you do
that, you stupid, stupid shit!
Don't touch it!
What in the hell's the
matter with you people, huh?
I wasn't gonna
do nothin' to you!
Why'd you do that?
Why'd you do that?
Does that answer your question?
All I wanted was a ride!
That's all! Just a ride!
You had no right to point
this damn thing at me!
Not at all. No right at all!
- Annie!
- Get outta there!
Get out of there!
Matt?
There's something in my eyes.
- Outta the car!
- Annie?
Get out of the car!
Get away from her!
Don't look at me! Don't look!
Don't look at me!
You got a baby in a car
with a loaded shotgun!
Real smart, asshole!
- You stupid shit, you!
- No!
You just remember who started this!
You hear me?
You remember!
You just remember!
That motherfucker fired first!
You understand me?
He fired first!
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
I see another car.
It's not gonna stop.
- This one's gonna stop.
- No, it's not.
No one will stop.
Oh, come on now.
Come on. See me here. Come on.
Stop! Please.
Come on.
Stop! Come on!
Stop! Come on! Goddamn it!
- Stop! Stop!
- Matthew! Move!
Stupid fuck!
Okay. Now, what do I do?
- Here's your safety right here.
- Uh-huh.
The safety's off now.
- The safety's off, all right?
- The safety's off.
To your shoulder tight.
This thing's gonna kick.
- Tight to my shoulder.
- Just pull the trigger.
What if I have
to shoot it again?
All right, you rack it
with this hand, on here.
You rack it down and
back, all right? -Okay.
Some of these shells work,
some of them don't.
You just keep racking and pulling the
trigger until one of them fires.
- Okay.
- Okay.
All right.
So, um, how long
are you gonna be gone?
It'll take me about an hour
to get to the house.
- You sure there was a car?
- Yeah. I saw it.
I want you to come back.
I...
Matthew, I really, really
need you to come back.
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. You're gonna
be fine, all right? -Okay.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Okay.
Oh, God. You're cold.
Yeah.
- You're freezing.
- Yeah.
- Yeah. I'm cold.
- Oh, God.
Yeah.
Okay.
Is that better? Is that better?
You okay?
It's gonna be okay. Okay.
Shh. Shh.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's okay. It's okay.
Oh...
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- A fly. There's a fly.
- It hurts?
- There's a fly!
- No, no. No, Joe.
Oh, God. Thank God.
Hello, hello? Hey? Hey?
- Oh, thank God.
- Yes?
My name's Matthew Kay.
We were drivin' and we stopped
to help a guy whose car...
Had broken down on the road.
He shot my friend,
and he stole our car.
- Slow down. Slow down.
- Yeah.
My wife and my baby, we're stranded
about five miles back there.
He really needs to get to a hospital.
Is there any way you could drive us?
You want me to drive you? -Yeah.
Or could we use your car?
I could pay you anything
when the power's back on.
You mean, take my car? -Yeah, look here.
Here's my license.
Just hold it up. -Just
take the whole damn wallet.
Do I know you?
No, man, you don't know me.
And I don't know you.
Nobody will stop.
He took our food and water.
All right. I can
give you food and water.
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Look, hey.
To be honest with you,
I don't know if you're lyin'.
- You don't know if I'm lyin'?
- That's right.
If I was lying, I'd not be
standing here talking to you
I'd be kicking
through your fucking door!
What the hell are you
talking like this for, huh?
This is not gonna help you. This
is not gonna help you at all.
- This isn't your house.
- What?
Whose house is this?
Somebody I know.
I don't have to explain
- myself to you.
- You are so full of shit!
Who the hell are you
to talk to me like that?
Just let me use your goddamn car, all right!
That's all I want!
No,
I won't let you use my god...
Look man.
I can't just hand my car over
to the first person that asks.
I mean how the hell do I know you ain't
got somebody waiting in the bushes
as soon as I open this door? -Listen
man, my friend is gonna die!
All right?
He's gonna bleed to death
in the back of the fuckin' car!
Wait, wait, wait, I thought
you said your car got stolen.
Yeah, the car was stolen...
All right. Like I said,
I can give you food.
No, I don't want the food!
A ride! I need a ride!
Man, step away from the door.
What would you do if
I pushed my way in here, huh?
What would you do then?
I would stop you.
Get...
God damn it!
Fuck...
Oh.
Leave them right
where they are.
Oh, shi...
- Shit!
- Put it down!
- Put it down! Put the gun down!
- You put it down!
- You put the fucking gun down!
- Put the gun down.
- Put the gun down!
- Put the gun down!
Don't make me...
Shit!
No! No! Don't load it!
Don't load that thing! Stop it!
Don't make me...
This fucking gun!
Don't make me shoot you!
Don't...
Daddy!
Oh, Jesus. -Hey! Hey!
Don't point that at her!
- Look at me!
- I didn't know!
- Look at me!
- I didn't know!
Get back in the room, Kari!
Don't look at her!
You look at me. Look at me.
Go back in the room!
I'm takin' your car!
I'm gonna bring it back!
Why the fuck
should I trust you?
Because I'm gonna trust you.
Hey.
We'll take you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- You find his card?
- Uh, no.
Is that it?
Yeah. Yeah, it's right here.
Great.
Joe, we'll be right behind you.
Okay, and ready?
One, two, three.
Hello?
Yeah.
