Prevented me to do good
to one another ...
as much as possible ...
to do what I think is good.
But it was not.
People believe what they want,
but ultimately you must decide
if you do the right thing.
Choice cost me more
than I thought.
- Daddy!
- Son!
A brave boy ...
And my son Jeb was courageous.
And loyal.
And was killed in cold blood
by his best friend.
Go ahead.
Son, are not worthy of this uniform.
You're in and one and a traitor.
Well, like that are.
But has no connection with him!
Of course it does.
And you've killed my family.
Please do not do that.
You killed your own people
and killed my son.
I beg you, sir! I beg you!
You kidnapped me everything you loved, Jonah Hex.
You know what?
Do not do it!
Look like that e. ..
- I want to see ...
- No!
No!
I will deliver, but you walk
with a sign on the front.
And every day I'll
remember that sign
What did not take everything.
I stayed on that cross
for days ...
When I found Crow
Indians Crow ~ ~
I was almost dead.
Spook did their utmost
to bring me to life.
EAM fails to find my exit.
And crows appear to
remain with me.
I did not have immortal.
Gave me only to know the curse
of the other world.
Talking to the dead is
not really normal.
But sometimes the only ones
who can guide you.
I wandered in the land
of long and wide-n
Turnbull's looking.
Then bitch let me play
the last tricks
and to die in a fire in a hotel.
He took his family with him.
I had no where to take it, his
heart a thirst for revenge.
It seemed normal to become
a bounty hunter.
Let him punish those vinovaţi.
This is my story.
Jonah Hex.
Jonah Hex.
- I got your guys that were looking for.
- Clayton brothers.
Yes.
I think we have a little problem, Mr Hex.
There are four brothers Clayton
and you got three.
I do not see how I could reward you with
remuneraţia established in terms ...
- The last was too fat and horse ...
- Mr Hex ...
Needles are guys caused
us much trouble.
I have shown evidence that they are vinovaţi.
I brought it simple.
We've done a big favor.
There was only one transaction.
I will get a reward of 100 dollars
and I will see the road.
Therefore, Mr.
Hex was a short term offer.
But you pay anyway.
Mr Hex ...
Are unscrupulous few who will pay
twice as much for your carcass!
Five coffins.
Are you sure you do
not need eight?
How many shot him!
Congratulations.
Mom.
What do you think those men?
Down!
Keep calm.
Surpass them in number.
Prepare you to grasp!
Kill conductor. Desf locomotive.
Do not nobody move!
Move!
You're absolutely sure
it was Turnbull?
Sure, Mr. President Grant.
Wretched and has staged death.
- Why now?
- I can venture to guess.
Is celebrating a century in
more than 20 countries.
What a ready ...
have ten days to discover.
Excuse me, sir, but the
president is interested
if a federal general is alive?
After Gettysburg, Turnbull
has changed.
The target hospitals,
schools, churches,
enough to inspire fear people will
overthrow the government until
not protect them.
Mexican slaves have put a nickname.
How was it?
- Terrorism.
- Terrorism.
Put the gun in our căruţa.
Burn what is left of those two
guys and bury them honorably.
Burn the rest!
Tell me what you know,
Lieutenant.
All we can confirm is that Turnbull
has taken some of that train.
And that has infiltrated the
army a week before Virginia.
- In Virginia?
- Yes, sir.
A construct.
Plans have been finalized.
Construct weapons.
Sir, as well you know,
my drive is the best!
Yes, lieutenant, so I need you
You find it on this man.
- Jonah Hex
- Yes.
- Hex is a bounty hunter.
- A man was once a hero.
- Sir, we all know what they say.
- Hex handed over to Turnbull
and his men.
And has paid much awful.
- Sir, Turnbull ...
- Listen to me me, gentlemen.
The fate of our nation may depend
entirely by Jonah Hex.
Does not seem like that hard.
It seems to me hard.
Not me.
Be careful.
Hex!
What path have to face?
I cut you shave.
What would you path in front?
For broken glass.
It is time to leave, Mr. Nash.
Grayden Tell me, please.
Are you even think about?
Leaving, and children up.
Let's go to town.
I'm not playing the mother.
We concluded transaction.
if you want to see me tomorrow,
you pay like everyone else.
I do not want to touch someone!
- Mr. Nash ...
- Okay.
See you tomorrow.
Idiot ...
Jonah Hex.
Lilah.
Come.
Been a while, Hex.
We all walked.
You're worried about me, right?
No.
I'm worried about you.
Look how many times
you been shot.
It is more than a
man can endure.
Apparently I was lucky
most times.
What was first?
I do not remember neither
the first nor the last.
Let me see who is first.
That may be the second.
Third.
Fourth.
You're safe here, Jonah?
Come after you?
Always do.
I noticed that.
It's different this time.
You've killed people.
Wore badges, but none
of them was a lawman.
You did this.
If I listen, I will
kill them first.
I will have to go.
To the south-west.
Of course.
It's a dream, you know.
Do I sit here waiting.
We can go somewhere.
Anyone close to me dies.
We have a future
together, Lilah.
Look at you ...
Should not be so sure
of me, Jonah Hex.
The next time you come you
may not You find me.
It's all I can do, Lilah.
Woman, how many men have a day?
Jonah Hex?
By presidential order, are called
to military service.
You will be rewarded for
performing services.
Your country needs you.
Not my country.
Disappear or die.
Hex, you must come with us.
You can not knock
down 12 people.
I like challenges.
Quentin Turnbull.
You're not dare to, and
mentions your name it!
Quentin Turnbull is alive.
Turnbull ...
S life.
I thought I will not
hear this name.
Thank you that you have honored
us with its presence, Mr Hex.
I was told to talk to you.
Where is Turnbull?
The President seems to believe
that you're special.
Magic, really.
- I know, right?
- I know.
What is not know why
we bother with you.
To show you something.
This is the future, Hex.
Intelligence, information.
With our sophisticated network
that you will keep the past.
When we finish this ...
- The future looks bright.
- Listen.
We received information that Quentin
goes to Springfield, Georgia.
What you said is called ...
Information.
Turnbull's men attacked
a train of us.
I managed to recover some ...
To learn something.
Unfortunately he died
during interrogation.
I want to talk to him.
Dead, Hex.
However ...
Hi, how are you?
- Why is this happening?
- I think you're dead, buddy.
How to talk to me?
This is something that I got
when I was and I was dying.
Can stop the pain.
I just need some
information first.
What did I do not
normally Thiele.
If you continue you can burn it.
It seems that as soon're dead,
the faster it will happen.
If you're dead, come and see how it starts ...
On all the ones I've ever known.
What?
I'm looking for Quentin
Turnbull.
I've never not known.
- Who recruited you?
- Do you stop the pain.
- Who?
- Make it stop.
Who?
Slocum.
- Where?
- In South Carolina.
Earth loves the dead, dead
like earth, is simple.
What's that sound?
Huh? I think dogs are hell.
I can smell fresh meat.
Will come soon give you away.
There ...
Do not try to pet him
if I were you.
Are moving towards
the southeast.
- Have you heard of the dead?
- Ask and you.
Mr Turnbull, I do not know if
you can give what I ask for.
The reason I'm sure I'll
give what you ask,
because it will exit in profit.
And you will refuse a return
if you refuse a worm corpse.
Do not worry, you're free
to keep your business
parties behind closed doors,
smoking cigars ...
But you continue to
do what you ask.
Mr Turnbull, I gave each
transport routes secret
location plans ... but this ...
Crucial moment is coming.
Be sure that this country will
start a second century.
And when America will be in flames, you'll
be glad you did înţeleaptă choice.
Can you tell me where is name of the
manufacturer for that gun trigger.
- Orange spheres ...
- There seem to be much.
But you erase everything
on earth, anyway.
Take them, but you do
not care scăpaţi.
There, boy.
- Losses?
- They're all dead.
What's this?
I found this one hiding
some baby clothes.
Please, leave them to
go on the innocent.
Nobody is innocent.
Must deliver weapons.
It's time than expected.
And in this corner, from the other
side of the world, Snake Man.
Plague and get it, Snake.
- What good fun here, Colonel.
- Hex!
Come on!
Do what you're going.
- Do not want to kill me.
- I'm not ready to order yet.
I had other problems.
I'm looking for the Turnbull.
Gully, Turnbull is dead.
You know as well as anyone.
Someone told me that he has
not died in that fire.
Tracks are ghosts.
You should quit.
You buried your best friend.
You betrayed your regiment.
... And for what?
Honor? In war there is no honor.
War means to kill. ... Just as
A little blood and this entire
country could be ours.
Those days are long gone.
What if your had and say
it's not too late.
I still can kneel
to the union are.
You do not want a second chance?
Okay.
I decided that I want
to kill you.
I thought about myself that
this would be your choice.
Boys ...
Dispose of it in.
Slocum ...
Where is Turnbull?
Why not ask your friend, Jeb.
I think it finds you in Hell.
You know what, Colonel?
There might be a good idea.
Check a fair fight?
Are gelo and because arătaţi
better than her boys.
Whatever.
And me and have done so.
God, can you be a villain.
And I'm glad to see you, Jeb.
If I let you get up, promiţi
that are not love me again?
It seems that I have
little choice.
- Where were you, Jeb?
- Do you think you may help you?
Any help is me.
- Well ...
- Okay.
- We need your help, Jeb.
- I can trust you.
- You killed Jonah.
- I wanted to do it, Jeb.
Damn, that was a mistake.
Well, I do not really
make mistakes.
Do not have listened
to a direct order.
Burned a hospital.
Your father would be killed
just to prove something.
I could not accept something like that.
I'm surprised that
you have accepted.
He was our commander.
It was my father!
- I had no choice.
- Me neither.
I'm sorry for what happened.
Because I killed ...
I do not expect thanks
for what happened.
Killed my family in
your name, Jeb.
I was forced to see
them as dead.
You must find it, Jeb.
I chased and I chased
him and him.
Becomes increasingly difficult to make
a distinction between you two.
- Your father is a monster.
- And you're not?
From my point of view ...
Ucideţi're two people to
make the pain disappear.
A. I am not of and I think
that is a real curse.
You know what's in the state.
Jonah ...
Fort Resurrection.
You find him there.
Hope you can solve problems
once and for all.
I know who's chances of victory
and know who's gonna thin.
Anyone would be soon, you
will not have one.
You're right.
Fire. Should I return to earth.
Listen!
You are talking about here.
So I Do good and do not
die, do you read?
Because people here have
plans with you.
A wine to HAC, Jeb.
See you soon.
Will never come after you.
You do not know where to.
Who told you that the Government
is coming here?
Get the hell out of my room.
I bought the old man Jack Straw
as legally possible.
We're gonna do whatever I want.
You're my property.
You tricked me once, baby ...
A reliable pistol cartridges.
And I do not like to
be owned by anyone.
Every time I see you're
still ugly.
You would be able to break all
the mirrors we have here.
Come ...
These look good.
- Thiele you must thank your for them?
- I thought we were
not gonna ask.
I guess I'm on your liking.
Of plans for July 4?
For me it's just a normal day.
Jonah ...
both know that the reason for the purpose
of the studies and Communities lupţi
is not because you like that your government
to tell you what to do.
Do not have same views as us.
Slocum never had nor reliable.
So I, why are union hates
you know so much?
Whatever part lupţi, all
are some ipocriţi.
Forth to America a hundred years, Jonah.
It's no joke.
What's this?
What will be the future.
Me and my boys ...
one to go to Washington.
We want to sit next
to people free.
Regardless of skin color.
Listen to the president.
Country has its affairs.
I have on mine.
Take them both.
- Are made in Memphis, right?
- Certainly not cheap.
You know who was Eli Whitney?
I am an educated person,
Mr Turnbull.
- We talk about Whitney Senior or Junior
- Senior ...
When he invented the machine and started
ginning industrial revolution
started working for the U.S.
Army.
Special Projects ...
Pioneered the use of
sub-assemblies,
pistols and ammunition to fuel.
More or less by himself, he
invented "modern warfare"
Like exercise, your Thiele asked
to invent a super weapon.
A weapon that will destroy
an entire nation.
He and and something and he
wanted, but not successful.
Once and realized the potential
of this weapon,
have decided they can not
do much harm their peers.
But I can.
And over a week we will succeed
where they failed.
July 4 ...
United States of America will
make acquaintance with Hell.
Cheers.
Omorâţi it!
Thank you.
Sorry, Jed.
Fucking Jonah Hex.
His face to recognize
it anywhere.
Guys, it looks like we got
a target for training.
Impressions and cutting.
Not grasp.
We need him alive.
A Turnbull's gift to
make you dinner.
Look at you ...
He and the, well done ...
Just so you're able?
Really? Jonah Hex?
Jesus Christ ...
Look what a plight you got.
Do not go nowhere, boy.
Do not worry, honey.
I'll be back.
Hex?
Hex?
Come here. Take me home.
- Explain to me over.
- There is no explanation.
I shot the bastard twice
directly in the chest.
Should be as dead as this
one here, and Billy.
Hex does not know how to die.
We have to teach him.
I have no problem
with the teacher.
Jonah Hex is still alive.
And somehow, fucking, and
know that I am alive.
You finds something that loves
me and bring him to me.
You might like this to draw us.
A beautiful face to let to
rot in a ditch somewhere.
Like a pig ...
He and the would be best.
Gentlemen, this location
is compromised.
Charge what is the price on trains.
Remember the dynamic
and the other.
I got the other. It bothers me.
Some say we are about to die.
But one can not make up your
not solve all the checkbook.
Revenge is the only thing
that solved it all.
Hex!
I think there still
is not much to say.
Fire!
One day, with such weapons,
you can crush continents.
But we have to thank us
with something smaller.
We are ready, sir.
Not sure grăbiţi.
- Where?
- A little apart from Wayne
County, Georgia.
- Victims?
- 324 people.
- Point military?
- None, sir. Only civilians.
Estimate how the situation?
There are more than 20 cities
with more events.
A fair near Philadelphia.
Then in New York.
Detonaţi bombs.
Our military presence in so many
it offers an unlimited number of locations
where they could attack.
It is impossible to predict
where it will attack.
I do not know how to begin, sir.
Nice.
Six long years spent on the road
without doing anything.
Six long years spent on the
road, învăţând to fight ...
Small oiţă ...
Lost the flock?
I finished work today.
- What is wrong with you?
- Just to have fun.
There must be no one hurt.
Târfuliţo!
Come on.
Come on, be cool.
Since they were here ...
Since they were here,
and you were ...
Here I was, and here my
brave son, Travis.
Basically, this thing
is useless.
Can your brain feel just putting
my hand on your head.
You took everything
I loved, Jonah Hex.
I want to know how it is.
He and the is.
I approached are.
Jonah!
No!
Lilah!

To send everything he has or will die by the thousands.
Stop.
Port Independence, Virginia.
Give him water. Not to law.
If not go back, you
let them be free.
Has a name?
Cal.

Hear.
Hear the six long years.

I will certainly be hanged
if you're not succeed.
And I sincerely hope
to avoid that.
Think and do.

- Let's go!
Start!
It's good. Come, come.
You know you're a
monster, do you?
Tell me, as you go through
life with such a face?
We're gonna learn.
This is for my wife.
This is for my son!
Turnbull! Turnbull! Turnbull!
Gentlemen,

their boat.
O to sail along the surfing ...

know how to do it.
To make war!
To the capital!
Joy fight!
Turnbull! Turnbull! Turnbull!
Hex!
You know they say
you never heard.
I think on the contrary, my son.
You're soft.
Are you willing to sacrifice.
If you do not surrender, you
see someone else die.
Good boy.
Once in and, and always.
Burke hello.
No!
I want to watch.
Three minutes before we
get within range, sir.
Our country ...
1000 meters up to the target.
You got fuckin 'gun concealed?
No, I have taken.

- They've got.
- But ...
- They took everything, Jonah.
Did percheziţionat damn

You do not have done the same?
All right, look what you do.
A watchman to cry out, you

When you approach a ...
What the hell?
Mother Talula not

- Talula?
- His nickname Lola.
Talula. Talula ...
2,000 feet from the target, sir.
A fast ship, river.
You are in U.S. military custody
You all know to be accused

No, and I like to EFI.
Sorry ...
They say a vengeful

One for the enemy and one
for himself and I.
I think mine will have to wait.
