Permission to enter?
Come.
Where's the rest
of the company, Captain?
Where do you think?
They moved out with the battalion.
I've been waiting here for you.
You took your time getting back.
I got lost in the smoke.
What happened to your gun?
Have you ever seen
a shell-shocked horse?
He stomped all over me
and got my rifle.
Smashed it to smithereens.
I suppose horses have as much right to
go crazy in this war as men have.
What do you think?
What the hell is it?
It's a one.
1 st Infantry Division.
The Red One.
Think General Pershing will like them?
I got the idea from a cap...
...of a Hun I killed.
When?
About an hour ago.
Did he yell out anything?
The same old Kaiser stuff.
You know, "the war's over,"
all that junk.
Finish it.
-Sir?
-Finish it!
The Armistice was signed...
...at 11:00 this morning.
The war's been over for 4 hours.
You didn't know it was over.
He did.
A quarter of a century later,
that piece of red cloth...
...from the dead Hun's hat had become
famous all over the world.
It was the insignia of
the 1 st Infantry Division.
The Fighting 1 st.
The Big Red One.
24 years later, the Big Red One
It was World War II this time.
We were invading North Africa.
Hey, Griff.
Great!
Thanks, Sergeant.
We were his Rifle Squad.
1 st Squad, 1 st Platoon,
"I" Company, 1 6th Infantry.
He called us his "wetnoses."
Griff, he was a hell of a sharpshooter.
Johnson was a pig farmer
with hemorrhoids.
Vinci was a street kid
who played hot jazz on the saxophone.
And that's me. I'm Zab.
I thought I was
the Hemingway of the Bronx.
You really a book writer?
What book did you write?
The Dark Deadline.
Never heard of it.
Never read it.
It's an unpublished mystery novel.
Left it with my mother.
Why's a book writer a rifleman?
To come out with a war novel, meathead.
Why else?
You going to be a cartoonist
for a big newspaper, Griff?
Hey, Griff, you do everything
left-handed?
Everything but shoot.
And play with my pecker.
"Watch out, Vichy...
...here comes...
...the Big...
...Red...
...One!"
Vichy?
I always thought Vichy was
some kind of soda pop.
Vichy's the French
fighting on Hitler's side.
That's why we're wearing these.
So they don't shoot Americans.
We dropped leaflets
so they know we're coming.
If they start a fight,
we'll have to kill them.
We were in this war
to fight Germans, not Frenchmen.
We were kind of hoping
they were feeling the same way.
Put your rubbers on.
It'll keep the saltwater out.
Thanks, Griff.
I'll bet the guy that
invented these things...
...never figured
they'd be used on a rifle.
I never could score with them.
How about you, Johnson?
Not me.
Over on the Algerian beach...
...lots of French soldiers
were reading our leaflets...
...and wondering if
they were going to fight.
The colonel is stupid
not to believe these leaflets.
We are no good.
You, me, all of us here.
Defending this miserable
Algerian beach...
...for Marshal PÃ©tain
and Adolf Hitler.
I can't kill an American.
There are four things
you can hear on the boat:
The waves, the engines...
...an occasional muffled prayer...
...the sound of 50 guys
all heaving their guts out.
French troops...
...don't shoot!
We are Americans!
Don't shoot!
We come to fight Hitler...
...not to fight with you.
Don't shoot!
Hold your fire!
Sergeant Broban!
Yes, Colonel?
Open fire.
Not at Americans.
Medic! Medic!
Nail him, Griff!
How the hell could you miss him?
Hell, he's close enough
to kiss on both cheeks.
What the hell's the matter with you?
I never saw you miss.
Medic, over here!
Sixteenth infantry...
...hold your fire!
Americans!
This is Captain Chapier.
General Tavernier is dead.
Americans!
I surrender my troops to your hands!
Frenchmen!
We do not accept your surrender!
You surrender only to the enemy!
If you're Vichy, fight us!
If you're Frenchmen, join us!
We were feeling cocky as hell.
Except Griff.
In the middle of the battle,
he froze.
It got to Griff.
He kept away from
the rest of us.
Nobody wanted to use
the word ""coward. ""
Not yet.
How come we're not pushing inland?
Red Company's carrying the ball.
Take your malaria pills.
I wonder what they gave you
in the other war...
...not to get a hard-on.
The same stuff you're wolfing down now.
It has saltpeter in it.
Griff's back.
I can't murder anybody.
We don't murder, we kill.
It's the same thing.
The hell it is, Griff!
You don't murder animals,
you kill them.
The truth is, none of us
had the faintest idea...
...what war was all about.
We hadn't met the Krauts yet.
Communications Center caught
an American bomb.
These wetnoses found the phonograph
and one record undamaged.
Look at the faces
of these puppies, Schroeder.
They think the Horst Wessel song
is holy.
Horst Wessel was a pimp...
...who supplied Hitler
with baby faces like you.
He was killed in a brawl
over a whore in Berlin.
A poem by a pimp...
...became the hymn of Hitler's party.
That right, Schroeder?
Don't want to disillusion
these infants?
You're getting soft.
Schroeder used to be tough.
In Libya, l saw him murder
a German officer.
I did not murder him, Gerd,
I killed him...
...when he ran from a fight
with the British.
Murder.
Kill.
It's the same thing.
We don't murder the enemy, we kill.
Everything is on the move.
Battalion's sending us
to the Kasserine Pass.
We're going to choke on
Panzer fumes.
Not me, Schroeder.
Let Rommel's Panzer Grenadiers
march behind his tanks.
But not me.
I want no more!
I'm no damn Nazi fanatic like you!
Germany is through...
...singing for Adolf Hitler.
Our brilliant generals figured...
...that Rommel's push would come
at a place called Spiva.
So they massed most of
the Allied Forces over there.
But they sent our regiment
around the back way.
Through a shithole called
the Kasserine Pass.
Our squad was on point.
We got an eyeful, all right.
The whole Afrika Korps was coming
through the Kasserine Pass.
Rommel had caught us
We got tanks, boys!
And infantry with them!
They'll be looking behind the rocks
for anti-tank guns.
So, let's go!
Let's go!
Sergeant, where we going to run to?
They'll spot us out in the open.
We're not running.
We're digging in.
Digging in?
Are you crazy, Sergeant?!
Dig in and let them
roll over our heads.
Hey, they're going off
to the right!
Guess again, jerk-off.
Look over there.
Jeez!
Down!
They're all over the place!
The war is over for you.
We won...
...you lost.
You are in a temporary German hospital
in Tunis, Sergeant.
Our doctors are very impressed
with your recovery.
You should be dead.
We better get out of here.
You heard what that orderly said.
This is an unmarked hospital
and they'd just as soon blast us.
Anybody here from the Big Red One?
Sixteenth.
Eighteenth.
Where's that Big Red One man?
What happened at the pass?
You with the sixteenth?
You one of them goons?
"l" Company, 3rd battalion.
What are you doing wrapped up
in that Arab bed sheet?
What happened at the pass?
We counterattacked after you jokers ran.
We took Kasserine...
...Gafsa, El Ketar...
...Tunis. We ran Rommel
right out of Africa.
You mean the Big Red One took Tunis?
We sure as hell did.
This is Tunis.
You're right.
We took Tunis.
The old bastard just couldn't face
being left behind.
He heard we were shipping out
to invade Sicily.
Where's the first squad?
Where's the first squad?
Out of the original
twelve-man rifle squad...
...the four of us were
the only ones left.
This invasion wasn't
going to be like North Africa.
The beach would be heavily defended.
So now, at least, we could
all go to Sicily...
...and get killed together.
Gave the supply officer a Luger for it.
By the way, what were you doing
in that Arab bed sheet?
They were shanghaiing
all the combat non-coms...
...as training replacements
for those rebel devils.
Where'd you steal it, Stoop?
My name's Shep, not Stoop.
l got it from
the St. George Hotel in Algiers.
I understand you're an ltalian, Vinci.
How come they let a
Wop in this man's army?
l don't think a Wop's
going to fight a Wop.
I think all you'll do
is drink dago red...
...and sing "O Sole Mio."
O Sole mio
l like "O Sole Mio."
The creepy thing about battle
is you always feel alone.
All you can see
are the guys right next to you...
...and the bodies
you keep tripping over.
Why are we always sent out?
This the only squad in the whole Army?
Where's the rest of the Army?
There are eight patrols checking
the villages for diehard snipers.
Anybody wants a transfer,
just let me know.
I want a transfer.
Okay, Vinci.
You're transferred to the point.
You know how you smoke out a sniper?
You send a guy out in the open
and see if he gets shot.
They thought that one up
at West Point.
You okay, Sergeant?
Why?
You just let Vinci waK into a sniper.
That's why he's here.
We got plenty of wetnoses here too.
You really want to finish that book,
don't you?
That's why I'm here.
Vinci made it.
Come on, Cole, it's your turn.
Let's go. Come on!
Hey, Vinch!
You know where he lives?
Working your right.
I'll go left.
It's your ball.
Bravo! Bravo!
You had him in the sights all the time.
All the time.
Just wanted to see me sweat?
Punishment for transferring me
to the point.
May l rejoin the rear echelon now?
You are transferred back to the point.
My aching butt!
By now we looked at
all replacements as dead men...
...who temporarily had the use
of their arms and legs.
They came and went so fast...
...that sometimes we didn't
even get to know their names.
The truth is, after a while...
...we sort of avoided
getting to know them.
l brought some water.
Do you know what they call
you four guys at Battalion?
The Sergeant's Four Horsemen.
l don't get it.
You lived through North Africa.
You didn't even get a scratch.
That's because replacements
keep getting hit instead of us.
You think maybe I'll get it?
Why not?
You something special?
I'll go get some, all right?
Excuse me.
Water.
You'll live, Smitty.
You hit a tripwire on a mine.
They're not designed to kill you...
...just to castrate you.
Castrate me?
Here it is. l found it.
Oh, my God!
It's just one of your balls, Smitty.
You can live without it.
That's why they gave you two.
Supposed to be coming this way.
Hold it up.
l said, hold it up!
I'm eating.
Get inside here.
Come on.
I feel for snakes.
And bats.
Bats? l love bats.
Sergeant, what's the word
from headquarters?
What'd the lieutenant say?
The lieutenant said
the Hermann Goering Panzers...
...overran the 2nd Battalion.
lf they break through division...
...we're in the sea.
Where are they headed?
Right for us.
Our heavy guns will clobber them.
Still on the water.
None of them have unloaded yet?
Not yet.
Patton's got tanks.
Still on the water.
Jesus! We're sitting
in our own coffin.
We knew he wanted to run for it.
But we knew he wouldn't...
...way before he did.
Anyway, the Sergeant would've
shot him if he tried it.
Are those American guns?
l thought they were
still on the water.
Beats the hell out of me.
Relays.
Relays!
Radio!
Lieutenant?
First squad, first platoon.
You're kidding?
Yes, sir!
You know who fired that artillery?
The United States Navy.
That was the cruiser Savannah,
miles offshore, right?
Right.
Can you believe that?
The U.S. Navy saved our ass!
Where's our planes?
Why can't they spot that gun?
I don't know.
Battalion's got twenty patrols
looking for it in this quadrant.
-They think it's an S.P.
Right! We got a break coming to us.
You said the Army's made of
the 1 st Division...
...and 10 million replacements.
Where are they?
Being stuffed with a mattress cover.
l bet when we get off this island...
...we'll get our feet wet again
invading Italy.
You don't know geography
well, for a book writer.
-We're in Italy.
-This is Sicily.
Here they say:
"I'm a Sicilian, not an ltalian."
My old man was born--
l figure close to 2,500 bucks!
I'm sending every lira home.
Mussolini money's good for one thing.
It's Victor Emmanuel loot.
It's kosher.
Who told you that?
The captain.
An enlisted man can't send home
more than his pay.
-To discourage black marketing.
-But the lieutenant can.
It's for my old man,
to open up his own bagel shop.
l didn't know bagels were Italian.
Sure! The Pope eats gefilte
fish on Friday, don't he?
His mother.
He's hauling her to the beach.
Tell him we'll bury her.
l did. He's putting her
next to his father.
She's decomposing already.
The sun's blowing her up.
We got to find that S.P.
Ask the kid if he knows
where the gun is.
Hell, he doesn't know what an S.P. is.
Tell him it's a
self-propelled gun with wheels.
He knows where it is.
The smart aleck wants
to make a business deal.
Shell out some of that bagel money.
He'll take us to the gun
if an ambulance...
...takes his mother
to the cemetery in Gela.
He wants a casket...
...for his mother to sleep in.
And it's got to have 4 handles.
He'll get it...
...if he leaves his mother in the shade
and leads us to the gun.
Either we take her with us
or we find that gun on our own.
l don't know how long I'll
be able to take this stink.
Can it, Johnson, will you?
TaKing about it only makes it worse.
Hey, Sergeant.
You think this kid's leading us
into a bushwhack?
We're getting closer to
some kind of gun.
Can you see what it is, Sergeant?
It's an .88, all right.
On a Tiger tank in a house.
They got women working in front of it.
Under a schmeizer.
Makes a nice peaceful picture
from the air.
Hey, "what's-your-name."
You stay behind.
When you hear us fire,
you take out the schmeizer.
Those Sicilian women
cooked us a terrific meal.
It's too bad
they were all over 50.
We were more horny
than we were hungry.
A little mothering is good
in any war book...
...but this beats them all.
There's not a man
in the whole village.
Hey, Vinci.
Tell Matteo the meat wagon's
on its way to pick up his mother.
And that the General
is sending a casket...
...siK-lined...
...with six handles.
Matteo!
It's all right, Matteo.
That's okay.
Look, l told you, kid.
A deal's a deal.
Thanks a lot.
You're okay, Matteo.
It was the first time in ages
we'd all felt really good.
It lasted about an hour.
Then we got our orders to move out.
Where's my helmet?
The Krauts will spot that garden
a mile away.
l like the smell.
North Africa was sand and rocks.
Sicily was rocks and sand.
England was green.
We hung around England
for 7 months...
-...getting ready for D-Day.
-Gimme back my doughnut!
Then one day we were
in the boats again.
How about it, Johnson?
Who are you?
I'm Lemchek.
Lemchek, remember?
We been on dry runs
with this invasion...
...for 7 months in England.
I'm Lemchek.
How about what?
Will you swap with me?
Nope.
Eleven is my lucky number.
-Try Vinci, he might do it.
-Do what?
Will you swap numbers in
the bangalore relay with me?
My number 2 for your number 10?
How much?
$ 10,000.
$ 10,000?!
Where will you get $ 10,000?
It's from my GI insurance.
I'll make you my beneficiary.
Can you do that?
l can put Eisenhower down
for my beneficiary.
l can put down anybody l want.
Lumnuts!
I am really shocked.
You told me your mother
was your beneficiary.
What's wrong with you?
Don't you love your mother?
I love my mother.
Sure, I love my mother.
But she ain't number 10 on the relay.
Swap with him.
lf he gets hit, you get 10 grand.
What if l get hit using number 2?
$ 10,000 would buy a lot of bagels.
l like my number 10,
like Griff likes number 8...
...Zab, 9, Johnson, 11 ...
...the sergeant, 1 2.
lt's bad luck to change numbers.
You'll make it, Lemchek.
You know why?
We'll find nothing but
dead Germans on that beach.
Are you sure?
Are you really sure?
Sure, l'm sure.
You don't think l want
to blow $ 10,000, do you?
He don't want to blow 10,000.
Relax, Lemchek.
You heard what the captain said.
Only some schnell battalions...
...combat rejects defending the beach
at Coleville-sur-Mer.
First squad!
First squad over here!
Son of a bitch!
This beach hasn't been touched.
Either our shells and bombs fell too
far inland...
...or in the English Channel.
Vinci!
It's Lemchek!
You just blew 10,000 bucks!
Throw me his helmet!
Second squad!
Those combat rejects sure know
how to lay down fire.
Those aren't rejects up there.
That's infantry.
We couldn't move forward,
we couldn't move back.
Exit E-One was blocked by
a huge barbed wire tank trap.
Our navy was supposed to shell it...
...the planes
were supposed to bomb it...
...our bazooka teams
were supposed to blow it up.
If all else failed,
we were the last resort.
The bangalore relay.
First squad! First squad!
Bangalore teams 2 and 3
knocked out!
Our bazooka team?
Dead!
Bazooka team?
Killed!
Break them out!
Naturally, all else failed.
The bangalore torpedo
was 50 feet long.
And packed with 85 pounds of TNT.
And you assembled it along the way.
By hand.
I'd love to meet the asshole
who invented it.
Ready!
Number 1 !
-Number 2!
-Dead!
Number 3!
Number 4!
Number 5!
6!
-Number 7?
-Dead!
Number 8!
Number 8?
You better make it, Griff,
you son of a bitch!
Because my number's up next!
9!
Back off!
Come on!
Zab, tell the colonel.
Tell the colonel that
exit E-One is open.
Leyton!
Second division, right?
Dunham, 29th.
Get some coffees, doughnuts.
We'll chew the fat later.
Come on!
Throw the ball.
Just another buzzbomb
headed for London.
Yeah, a B-1 rocket.
How do you like the book?
Damn good.
My mother sent it to me
for my birthday.
l'm Zab.
Welcome to the 1 st squad.
I'm Kaiser.
Nice to meet you, Kaiser.
That's my book.
Your book?
What do you mean, your book?
I got this from the repple-depple
in Saint-LÃ´.
I wrote it, babyface.
And I printed it.
You! I don't want any infantry
around the Panzer.
Put the dead Panzer gunner
hanging halfway out the hatch.
2nd radioman.
Here, behind that man.
Put yourself in a good position.
As we slogged through the hedgerows
and across France...
...the sergeant began
keeping to himself.
It was a little spooky.
He told Vinci he fought around here
in the 1 st war.
He kept ahead of us,
as if he was looking...
...for some old ghost
to rise up out of the mist.
Kaiser!
It's your turn at bat.
Would you look how fast
they put up the names...
...of all our guys that
got killed?
That's a World War l memorial.
But the names are the same.
They always are.
Enemy scout advancing.
Give him a roundtrip ticket.
I don't want any of you to be
where l didn't plant you.
No fingers on triggers.
One shot in panic...
...and we've lost what I want:
A platoon of dead Americans.
Don't twitch any muscle.
Look dead, or you will be dead.
Give him a roundtrip ticket.
Nothing but a bunch of dead Germans.
-No dead dogfaces?
-None.
Let's go.
Enemy scout returning with patrol.
These dead guys give me the creeps.
Kaiser, something's always
giving you the creeps.
How come there aren't any dead Gl's?
Shut up!
Keep your eyes open.
Just like l said, Sergeant.
Just 3 dead Germans.
But the sergeant wasn't satisfied.
He'd noticed something about
the piping on their collar patches.
They were different colors.
What color is that piping?
-White.
-White's infantry.
Radio!
Get me the lieutenant.
Lieutenant?
-Lieutenant?
-Go ahead.
-This is Sergeant Possum.
-Possum, right. Where are you?

Nothing here.
Just a bunch of dead Krauts...
...and a knocked-out tank.
All right, sir.
We'll wait for you.
We could help, Sergeant,
but you're on your own.
-What's that?
-Good luck. Over and out.
What?
Yes, sir.
I'll be damned!
To hell with all officers!
He's afraid the platoon
will get lost coming up here.
So we got to go back and
handhold them all the way here.
I'll be a son of a gun!
Let's go.
Don't panic.
Live people are watching us.
It's a bushwhack.
Check for wounded Krauts.
You're good at that.
You should've been in the medics.
I was one in the Indian Town Gap.
-In Indian Town Gap, Pennsylvania.
-Never heard of it.
Is he dead?
Hey, Johnson.
You notice no one
taKs about home anymore?
Or women?
I noticed.
On the double, boys.
There's a woman in there.
Is she wounded?
Wounded, hell!
She's pregnant.
-She looks like she's about to pop.
-That's what the man said.
Jesus, Sergeant!
What are we going to do?
Get the dead Krauts out of the tank,
and get her in it.
-You're going to deliver a baby.
-What baby?
Her baby!
Her husband said she's got
labor pains 5 minutes apart.
Why me?
You're qualified.
Let's go.
Her legs got to be propped up higher.
Higher!
And spread them apart.
Wide apart.
Give me some room.
Face the bullets the other way,
away from her.
Relax, would you?
Go to work.
I need hot water.
There's no time for hot water.
Then some rubber gloves.
Griff, break out the condoms.
I need a mask.
I can't get germs on the baby.
Germs? There's more germs
in this tank than--
Look, no mask, no baby.
Fine, that's fine.
Get me a diaper pin.
The rubbers!
Easy, easy!
Come on!
That's the United States Army for you.
Take it easy, would you?
Put them together.
Lady...
...I'm a hell of a lot
more scared than you are.
So just take it easy.
Get her hands away.
Hey, Johnson, your dog tags!
I don't see the head yet.
You'll never see the head
if she don't push.
-She's got to push, I think.
-You think?!
-I think. She's got to push!
-You don't know?
-I know. She's got to push.
-Are you sure you know?
-I'm sure.
-You're sure, you're sure?
-I'm sure, I'm sure!
-Then do it!
Come on, damn it! Push!
Push!
It's no use.
She won't push.
We might as well write this kid off.
Can't you push for her?
Look, how do you say
"push" in French?
Poussez.
Pussy!
Pussy, pussy.
Johnson, you get the head.
I'll do the poussez 's.
Easy, lady.
We all love you.
Hey, I can see it!
I can see it!
I can see his head!
That's it, that's it.
Don't stop, lady!
Come on!
Don't stop, now!
It looks good!
He's coming out!
He's coming out!
He's out! He's out!
It's a boy!
A boy!
We got a bunch of medals.
Not for delivering the kid...
...just for killing Krauts.
The Germans were on the run now.
We were on their heels.
In September, we slipped across
the Meuse River into Belgium...
...ahead of the main American push.
Regiment figures there's a railway gun
that's been chopping them up.
Forward observers
in a monastery right here.
-Why don't we shell it?
-Throw a couple of bombs on it.
There's an underground fighter
living in that monastery.
It's a woman. She's a killer.
Her name is Walloon.
She has a squad plan for
a silent wipeout of the Krauts...
...without firing
or killing one civilian.
A woman in a monastery?
It's really not a monastery.
It's an asylum for retards
and insane people.
I say division should bomb it.
Killing insane people is not good
for public relations.
Killing sane people's okay?
That's right.
Let's go.

The Americans are coming
Two men in the tower.
Squad!
Come on!
Bayonnets!
Bayonnets!
Beautiful!
I am one of you!
I am sane!
I am sane!
Before I dropped him I was thinking
he might just be right.
When you're in a situation where
you can't tell crazy from sane...
...it's confusing for a soldier
but good for an aspiring novelist.
At least that's
what I kept telling myself.
I'll be a son of a bitch!
My mother sold my novel to Hollywood!
For Humphrey Bogart
and Edward G. Robinson!
For how much?
For 1 5,000 bucks!
Hey, we got another...
...Rockefeller in the company!
So what will you do
with all the moola, Zab?
First I think I'll blow
1 000 bucks on a squad party.
But you got to come up with the...
...damndest things you ever
wanted to do to a girl.
Hey, Griff!
I'm working on it.
Vinci.
Come on.
I'll tell you in a minute.
Johnson!
I think I'd like the most beautiful--
I know what I want.
Who the hell are you?
Kaiser.
You patched me up
behind that tank in France.
What tank?
I was the one that liked your book.
Babyface.
What do you want to do?
I want a big, Zoftig girl...
...to stick her plump butt...
...against an ice-cold window.
And just hold it there.
What will you do with a frozen butt?
Thaw it out.
It may take a while.
Tree bursts making millions of
splinters, Lieutenant!
Have they spotted your position?
They're just hitting the trees.
Take them out.
Watch out, they got snipers too.
Let's go!
Now watch yourself,
they still got snipers out there.
Can't see a goddamned thing.
Griff.
Zab.
Vinci.
Johnson.
Kaiser.
Kaiser.
I'm hit.
Where are you?
Find me.
Did I kill that guy...
...that killed me?
We'd thought we'd push through...
...but the Krauts regrouped
and counterattacked...
...and bumped us back into France.
Lieutenant.
We got tanks and infantry
coming straight at us at .33.
We spent the winter
freezing our asses...
...just to take back Belgium.
Kaiser, I'm beginning to see...
...what you like about big butts!
Sarkit, can you come here...
...so we can taK about it?
I'm going to like
wearing this purple heart!
That close! That's where he was.
Easy target! Easy target!
I don't know.
So he asked me why I didn't get him.
Zab, you know,
it's time to take the hill.
Take the hill.
Wait a second. Excuse me, my dear.
Would you help the young lady down
please, Sergeant?
Now. Let's see.
I paid for this party.
So the hill...
...will be took when I say
it's to be took!
I beg your pardon.
Okay, sir.
-Now move!
-Yes, sir!
Let's get on with it.
Don't forget your pieces.
Let's go!
Keep your front sight covers on
or else you'll get a rusty bore.
Let's go. Move it!
-Come on!
-I got to get--
The party was kind of
a last big blowout for us.
With the war almost over, we were sure
we'd be sent to the rear soon.
As usual, we were wrong.
The sergeant hadn't told us,
but we were being sent...
...to a place called Faicannel.
He knew what that meant.
We didn't.
You got him.
Jew?
Polish?
Czech?
Russian?
He walked around for half an hour...
...before he could bring himself
to put the kid down.
That night he buried him
in the woods.
Sergeant!
Sergeant!
Over here.
Where the hell you been?
I'm not going to tell you again!
-No lights at night.
-Sergeant, the war is over!
Look, nobody's firing at us.
One minute after midnight.
Official.
The war's been over for four hours.
Sarge, the dead Kraut.
He's still warm.
You didn't know it was over.
He did.
He's still alive!
Sulta!
Come on!
-Now the pills.
-Right here.
You're going to live,
you son of a bitch.
You're going to live
if I have to blow your brains out.
Saving that Kraut was
the final joke...
...of the whole goddamn war.
We had more in common with him...
...than with replacements who got
killed whose names we never knew.
We'd all made it through.
We were alive.
I'm going to dedicate my book...
...to those who shot
but didn't get shot.
Because it's about survivors.
Surviving's the only glory in war,
if you know what I mean.
