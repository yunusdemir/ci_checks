Shangkuan l-yun, your Eagle's Claw
destroyed all my Snake-fist schools
And killed 3000 of my students
The Eagle's Claw and Snake-
fist have been enemies for years
It's the god's will that
the Snake-fist is eliminated by me
I, as the leader of the Snake-fist...
will have a final fight with you
You should know that...
The snake-fist is no match
for the Eagle's Claw
I've to do this for my ancestors
I've no fear in death
Though I must die today
I still have descendents
You'll never eliminate
the School of Snake-Fist
I know Pai Chang-tien and
your son are alive
Yes, as long as Pai Chang-tien is alive
The flag of Snake-fist will rise again
I'll kill you, and then Pai Chang-tien
Where's Pai Chang-tien
He's resourceful, you'll never find him
Pai Chang-tien
Wait a minute
Thanks
I've told you not to come back
You want to die
It's him, he owes me a month's rent
Just take it easy, calm down, man
I've to show him some colors
or he won't pay me
Don't...
Stop, I promise I'll pay you
give me two days
Calm down
Nothing
Ah-Chiang, any money in the hamper?
There's a snake
It's really a snake
Snake

Want to go?

Not a loyal guy
Look at my bowl, man
How was my kick?
Hold on
My teeth...
Beat him
One, two, three, four and again, damn it
This is how to have a swollen face
A bowl, chopsticks, a bowl, chopsticks
I'll kill you
Weapon? You want to kill me?

Don't let him go
Excuse me...

Yeah
The painting is old
but the words are new
If you want to know where the god is
find him in heaven
Old man
You finally come over. Feeling better?
Much better, I'll be fine
Good, I'm worrying about you these days
I'll bring you some medicine
Drink it and you'll be better.
Chien-fu, I must thank you for this
Not at all
we're good friends
You've taught me how to escape, right?
Well, is it useful?
Yes, but...
I've riled Mr Li, I was beaten
You want to learn Kung-fu?
Sure, I won'be bullied if I know Kung-fu
But you must promise me three things
I'll promise you everything
First, don't call me master
Why?
Because we're good friends
Second
don't show what you've learnt easily
Okay, and?
And, if I fight with others
don't help me
No! How can I just stand there
if somebody attacks you?
No help, you promise me?
Okay, I promise
What are you going to teach me?
Snake-fist
Dirty cat, your master has slipped out
Eat, you must be starving...
You bastard
Sorry, Mr Li
You want to fight with me?
Mr Li, you must be very tired
You want to fight with me?
Mr Li, be careful
I'm always careful
Well, I've told you to be careful
Are you hurt?
Damn it
Who dares to make troubles here?
I've won the 3-provinces tournament
All Kung-fu schools in the province
come to congratulate me
Except Hung-tai School
The Champion
of the 3 provinces tournament
So I come to give you a lesson
You come to humiliate us?
Yes, who first?
You're too arrogant
Alright, Let me... Yes
Master Lian will give you a lesson
Master Li, you're an esteemed person
The honor should be yours
Thanks, but no thanks
I usually step aside
in this kind of circumstances
maybe you go first
Master Li, you please
You first... You first
Shut up, you two come together
You hit the upper part, I hit the lower
You attack the front
I attack the back. Good
Attack both sides
This is Front-and-back attack
My braid...
Not me, really
I won't use my hands
Good for me
Oh
The champion is fantastic
lets join Hung-Wai School
Go somewhere else. This is closed
Master Hung
Master Hung
Mr Hung, no lesson today?
Master Hung, if you've nothing to do
Come here as my assistance
I come here to challenge you
Master Hung, you must be mistaken
All your students
come to my place voluntarily
You ruined my place when I was out
You took my students and
it's all because of you
You can get back your students
if you can
Then you must give me this honour
You come here to challenge me
Then I'll satisfy you, come on
Chien-fu, stand aside
Yes, Master Hung
You look like a hero
but you're just useless
Master
You just stay there
This is my mentor
Master Hung, this is because of me
Let me handle this
Master Hung, be careful, he's good
Keep away
You're the so called
3-province champion?
Yes, it's me
No matter what happens
Don't use the Snake-fist I taught you
You are malevolence. You want to kill?
You really got guts, you want to die?
Don't come closer
I don't want to fight...
But you throw your shoes to me?
I haven't...
That's enough, stop!
You're good
Which kind of fist are you using?
This is the Outgoing Mantis, you see
This is the Snakes
Mantis catching a cicada
Poison snake behind you
Chien-fu Don't worry
It's bad if Chien-fu gets angry
Don't fight, I said
Mentor, it's me
You can't move now
Your Kung-fu is quite good
but you still tremble
After two or three hits...
you get a brick?
You get weapons?
Snake style
I'm a poisonous snake
This is Finding a snake
Master, let's go
Well-done, Chien-fu
let's join Hung-tai School
Call them back...
Chien-fu, I've to leave, it's urgent
I leave a book on Snake-fist
you can learn it yourself
Don't stop learning, I'll be back soon
Urgent?
Old man
Old man
Old man
Where is he going?
Who are you?
You're looking for the old man?
I... yes
I come to find him too
You want him too?
Who are you?
Who are you then?
Old man is my... my...
Your master?
You should call me uncle then
You're old man's brother?
Yes
It can't be
You don't believe me? Standing snake
Snake blocking the way
Master does like this
It looks right, but I think it's useless
You still don't believe me
Come on, let's try
Try? Okay
Uncle
Uncle
Some parts are good
but you still have weaknesses
Uncle
Get down
Gte down? This'll convince you
Why have I to? Watch out
What else do you have?
I whirl
I undress
Again?
I escape
I didn't give it
all because you're my uncle
Next time I'll give it all
Finding a snake
This snake is difficult to find
This is Snake taking a pearl
that's easy
Uncle, it hurts
Uncle
How can you hold back all my attacks?
Of course, or I won't be your uncle
Your attacks
seem to be different from master
That's because
your master hasn't taught you yet
Can you teach me?
I have to ask you master first
Where's your master?
He has just left
Left?
Where has he gone?
I don't know, but he said he'll back
When will he be back?
He hasn't told me
I'll tell you if he comes back
Good
But don't let him know
I'm looking for him
I want to give him a surprise
Good...
How can uncle fight better than master?
Where's the book?
It's must be damaged by the cat
Catch it
Catch
Good
You are great
you are better than kitty cat
Your claws are sharper than Kitty cat
If I combine the cat's claw
with the snake-fist
Chao Chi-chih
Master Shangkuan, you're really smart
Pai Chang-tien
Fairy House is just there
But you can't go there
You and Chao Chi-chih will die here
Hsiao chin, you still want to kill me?
Stop dreaming
It is cool, I don't need fanning
Kneel down. Bow. Get up
You're obedient
Old man
Where have you been?
I got something to do, it's urgent
I miss you, What take you so long?
I miss you too
Chien-fu, give the old man a cup of tea
Coming
Thanks
It's hot
Old man
A man come for you when you're out
Who's he?
You should know him
I know him?
Who's that?
Just have a seat
I'll tell you when I'm back
Uncle, I'm looking for you
old man returned
I'll bring you to him, come...
Hurry...
He's inside, I haven't told him, hurry
He's here
Old man...
He's here a while ago
Old man
Old man
Wait for me
Missionary
I am not Missionary
I am the No 1 man of Russian
What? What did you say?
The Eagles-claw wants me
to get rid of your snake-fist school
who has made use of you
You and your master will be game
over today
You're filthy
My legs are nearly broken
Pai Chang-tien
you're not going anywhere this time
Shanguan 1-yun
Don't you think that
the Eagle-claw fist you've created
is invincible
Let's end the enmity
between Eagle and Snake schools
And they'll be no Snake-fist anymore
I, Pai Chang-tien, will give my all today
And fight you till the end
Good
then your life should be ended today
Hit the snake at 7-inch
I'll take your gall
Pai Chang-tien
you're nothing but a sloppy snake
Luckily, this stone is hard enough
You're filthy, pretend to my uncle
you want to kill my master
You really got the guts, kid
I'll skin you later
You can't hurt him, he isn't my student
Right, I'm not his students
But he's my master
I won't care about this
I'll kill everyone who knows Snake-fist
It calls get rid of all
Get rid of all?
Master, he's dreaming
Chian-fu, you... you can't beat him, run
Master, how can I leave you here?
This foreigner is tricky
You bastard is frivolous
I'll take your teeth
You take my teeth? I'll take your beard
This isn't Snake-fist, what's it?
Cat's claw
Chian-fu
It's good
Chang
Why are you here?
I can't believe you're so good
Where do you learn it from?
I don't know it
My master taught me
Good... fantastic
Don't panic, master is here
Don't be self-satisfied
The tea you've drunk is poisoned
You're going to die immediately
Don't you know
I'm the Poison Eagle of Eagle's Claw?
You...
Lucky you didn't know my master
doesn't drink anything hot
I changed it!
Chian-fu, you're very smart
You combine the Snake-fist and cat's
claw to destroy Eagle's claw
but the name doesn't sound good
Master, give it another name
Then call it Snake in the Eagle's Shadow
Good, Snake in the Eagle's Shadow
