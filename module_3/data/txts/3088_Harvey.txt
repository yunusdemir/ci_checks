After you.
Is this 348?
Yes, it is.
I've got
a special delivery here.
Oh, that sounds interesting.
It's for Dowd.
Dowd's my name. Elwood P.
Here, sir.
Let me give you one of my cards.
That won't be necessary,
sir. Just sign right here.
Uh-huh.
Beautiful day.
Oh, every day's a beautiful day.
- There.
- Thank you.
He was a nice man.
Come on.
Thank heavens he's gone!
Oh, Myrtle,
it's a wonderful feeling
to have your relative out of the
house before the company comes.
Mother, you're sure Uncle
Elwood won't come back
and spoil everything
after the guests arrive?
Of course not, dear.
Your uncle always spends
the afternoon downtown
at those filthy bars and
taverns. You know that.
I'll go tell the
cateress to get started.
Why, Miss Johnson,
what are you doing?
Leaving.
Miss Johnson, you were hired
to serve as well as cater.
Our guests will
be here any minute.
Now, Miss Johnson...
Myrtle, let me
handle this, dear.
Miss Johnson, what's wrong?
There was a man
here a minute ago
and he stopped
and he spoke to me.
You didn't tell him anything
about our party, did you?
I didn't tell him nothing.
He gave me his card. Here.
And then he introduced me to somebody.
To whom?
Do you think I'd stay
in this house after that?
Oh...
- Oh.
- Oh!
Mother, people get run
over by trucks every day.
Why can't something like
that happen to Uncle Elwood?
Myrtle Mae Simmons,
I'm ashamed of you.
Even if people do call
your uncle peculiar,
he is still my baby brother.
And this thing is not his fault.
Whose fault is it then?
Now, we'll get the
cook to do the serving.
Come along and
lend me a hand, dear.
We haven't got much time. Elvira!
If it isn't his fault,
whose fault is it?
I know whose fault it is,
dear, but I'm not telling.
You're not telling?
Elvira?
Elvira, you can bring
those things in now.
Oh, Mother, why can't we
live like other people?
Myrtle Mae, do I have
to keep reminding you
your Uncle Elwood is not living
with us, we're living with him.
Living with him and his pal!
You promised.
With his pal Harvey!
You said that name.
You promised you wouldn't
say that name and you said it.
Mother, why did
grandmother leave
all of her property
to Uncle Elwood?
I suppose it was because
she died in his arms.
People are sentimental
about things like that.
You always say that and
it doesn't make sense.
She couldn't make out a will
after she died, could she?
Oh, Myrtle, don't be didactic.
It's not becoming in a young
girl. Besides, men loathe it.
Men! A fine chance I've got.
Now, Myrtle, dear,
you know the whole idea
of this party
this afternoon is to...
Is to get you started socially,
so that you can meet
some nice young men.
Oh, what's the use?
Myrtle Mae Simmons, her uncle,
Elwood P. Dowd, is the biggest screw...
...screwball in town!
Who'd want me?
Oh, Myrtle, dear, you're sweet
and you have so much to offer.
I don't care what anyone says,
there's something sweet
about every young girl.
And a man takes that sweetness
and look what he does with it.
Show some poise, dear.
I want you to
charm Mrs. Chauvenet.
She has a grandson
just about your age.
A lot of good that'll do
if Uncle Elwood comes home.
Well, Uncle Elwood won't
be home this afternoon.
Or will he?
I'm going to telephone Judge
Gaffney. We can't take any chances.
Mother, you better hurry.
Mrs. Halsey and Miss
Tewksbury are here already.
Oh, dear. Yes, dear, I am hurrying.
Well, hurry, Mother. They're
getting out of the car!
Oh.
Judge Gaffney, please.
Mrs. Veta Simmons calling.
Yes?
Oh. Put her on.
Veta, my girl,
this is a pleasure.
Judge, we haven't
got a moment to lose.
I'm having
the Wednesday Forum over
for a program tea and reception
for Ethel Chauvenet.
Elwood has just gone out, but
I'm so afraid he may come back.
You can understand why.
Oh, hello, Miss Tewksbury, Mrs. Halsey.
Go right into the drawing room.
Myrtle, dear, take their things.
Yes, you've got to
help me, Judge.
You've got
to help me. I can't...
Speak up, speak up, Veta.
What? I can't make out
what you're talking about.
Is that so?
Oh! Yoo-hoo,
Mrs. Strickleberger.
Oh, hello, Mrs. Simmons.
Oh, no, no, no. Yes,
that'll be all right.
You can depend on me.
All right.
Minninger, in a few minutes,
a man will be
crossing the square.
He'll be wearing a hat and coat
and carrying another one
over his arms.
I want you to follow him.
If necessary, even confront him.
- Quietly, of course.
- Yes, sir.
But at all events, I want you to
prevent him from returning to his house.
His sister is giving a
party. He wouldn't fit in.
His name is Elwood P. Dowd.
Elwood Dowd, sir! Couldn't
you get someone else, Judge?
Kratke, maybe, or Beck?
They're bigger than I am.
You'll be able to hide better.
Hurry now and stick
with him all afternoon.
Quickly, boy. Quickly.
Okay, sir.
Oh, elevator!
Come in.
Yes? Who is it?
Oh!
The doctor will
see you in a minute.
- Good afternoon, Mr. Dowd.
- How do you do?
We must be more careful.
After you.
- How do, Mr. Dowd?
- Afternoon, Mr. Cracker.
Excuse me.
How is he?
Oh, he's just fine, fine.
How are you?
Oh, can't complain.
That's good.
Is this all right?
You sure? Hmm?
All right.
Give you a hand there.
Whoop! Don't slip! There.
Now, you sure this is all right?
You wouldn't
rather sit in a booth?
- All right.
- Would he prefer a booth, Mr. Dowd?
Thank you, Mr. Cracker. He
seems to prefer the bar today.
Good afternoon to you, sir.
Mr. Meegles is back.
Oh.
Well!
You... Excuse me a minute.
Mr. Meegles, well, this is
a pleasure. We've missed you.
- How are you, Mr. Dowd?
- Fine.
And how is he?
Oh, he's splendid,
thank you. Splendid.
He decided he wanted
to come over here
this afternoon, so here we are.
Sit down.
Oh, thank you. You've been away.
- For 90 days.
- Oh.
Been doing a job for the
state. Making license plates.
Oh, is that so?
Interesting work?
- I can take it or leave it alone.
- I see.
I did a job for them last year,
too, helping them build a road.
Oh. Mr. Meegles, we'll just have
to do something about your return.
Would you like to come to
my house for dinner tonight?
Thanks, Mr. Dowd, but I
couldn't make it tonight.
Tomorrow night?
Would that suit you?
Yes, yes.
But, you know, the
last time I was there,
I kind of got the impression
your sister held it against me
'cause I did a little time.
Oh, no, Mr. Meegles. My
sister loves to entertain.
She's very social, you know.
Yes, I see by the papers.
You know, I never miss
the society column.
You don't?
No. She's giving a
clambake this afternoon.
- This afternoon?
- Yeah.
"Reception, program
and tea," it says here,
"for the members of the
Wednesday Afternoon Forum,"
for that rich Mrs. Shuvanut.
Yeah, that's Aunt Ethel. Yes.
Is it today's paper? Yeah.
Veta didn't tell me
anything about this.
It must have slipped her mind.
Well, I'll see you tomorrow
night at 7:00, Mr. Meegles, huh?
- Thanks, Mr. Dowd.
- Very glad to have seen you.
- Goodbye.
- Bye-bye.
Harvey, I just found out...
Now, what can I do
for you, Mr. Dowd?
What did you have in mind?
What's your order?
- Two Martinis.
- Two Martinis.
Harvey, it seems that Veta is
having a party this afternoon.
And I... Hmm? Oh, you knew?
Well, I just thought that she might
be offended if we weren't there.
After all, she's the only
sister I have and I...
How's that?
And the only one I'm
ever likely to have.
Yes, you're absolutely right.
We'd better hurry.
That'll be four bits.
The one at the end
will pay for it.
Come back here...
He'd be delighted.
He'd be delighted.
Well, let's drink up.

Mother.
Mrs. Chauvenet is here.
Mrs. Chauvenet is here?
Aunt Ethel!
Veta Louise Simmons,
I thought you were dead.
Oh, no. No, I'm very
much alive, thank you.
And this is
my daughter Myrtle Mae.
My dear, you're your
grandmother all over again.
I was at her funeral.
And now, where is Elwood?
Well, Elwood couldn't be
home this afternoon. Oh...
That's Miss Tewksbury singing.
She'll be through in a minute.
Oh, shame on him. That
was the main reason I came.
I want to see Elwood.
Do you realize, Veta, I
haven't seen Elwood in years?
I was saying to Mr.
Chauvenet just the other...
What do you want, my dear?
Just the other night,
"What on earth do you think
happened to Elwood Dowd?
"He never comes to the
Yale alumni dances anymore.
"I haven't seen him at the club
"or at the horse show in years."
Does Elwood see
anybody these days?
Oh, yes, Aunt Ethel,
Elwood sees somebody.
Yes, Aunt Ethel, he does.
Well, is Elwood happy,
Veta Louise?
Oh, yes, Aunt Ethel,
Elwood's very happy.
Now you mustn't
worry about Elwood.
Ooh! There's Mrs. Cummings.
She's waving at you.
Is that Mrs. Frank Cummings?
Doesn't she look ghastly?
I thought she was dead.
I must get a closer look.
We can go in now.
What did I do with...
Oh, there it is.
Oh, no.
Elwood. Elwood Dowd.
Bless your heart.
Aunt Ethel.
What a pleasure to come in
and find a beautiful
woman waiting for me.
Elwood, you haven't changed.
Elwood.
Well, well.
You both look lovely.
Elwood, some mail came
for you this afternoon.
It looked important, so
I put it up in your room.
Did you, Veta?
Well, that was nice of you.
Aunt Ethel, I'd like to have
you meet a very dear friend...
Aunt Ethel,
don't you want some tea?
Not just now, thank you.
There's punch if
you don't like tea.
But I do like tea.
Stop pulling me, you two.
Elwood, what night next
week will you come to dinner,
you and Veta and Myrtle Mae?
I'll have Ordway there.
Ordway is my grandson.
Any night. Any night at
all. I'd be delighted.
I'd like to meet Ordway.
And now, Aunt Ethel, I'd
like you to meet Harvey.
Harvey, you've heard me
speak of Aunt Ethel Chauvenet.
She's one of my oldest
and dearest friends.
She's the one who... Hmm?
That's right. This is the
one. No, no, she's the one!
She... He says he would've
known you anywhere.
Well... Now we must go in and
greet the rest of our friends.
Come along, Harvey.
Oh, uh...
Aunt Ethel, will you pardon me?
You're standing in his way.
There we are.
I'll see you in a minute.
Aunt Ethel, I can see that
you're disturbed about Harvey.
Now please don't be.
He stares that way at
everybody. It's his way.
But he likes you, I can tell.
He likes you very much.
I'm coming, Harvey.
I think I'll be running along.
- No tea? Or punch?
- No, no. Thank you.
Perhaps a nice
little lemon fizz...
No, I'll be going. Goodbye.
...with a turkey wing
and some walnut dressing?
Oh, no!
Elwood. Elwood.
Oh, no. Not Mrs. Halsey.
No, she has a nephew.
He's a little bit old,
but he would have
done in a pinch.
Mother, I can't face
those people. I just can't.
Myrtle, your uncle
has disgraced us
for the last time in this house.
I'm going to see to that.
You're no match for him. He
always gets the best of you.
- Where are you going?
- Upstairs to pack.
I'm going to lose myself
in some strange city.
I'm going to change my name.
No, don't do that yet, dear.
Wait until I telephone
Judge Gaff... Judge Gaffney.
I'm going to do something
I should've done long ago.
I don't understand it, Veta.
Mr. Minninger is as
trustworthy as the Bible.
I don't know anything
about your Mr. Minninger.
But I do know Elwood Dowd
when I see him and he's here.
He's here, I tell you.
Well, if you insist he's there,
then I must act on the
assumption that he's there.
Minninger! You failed!
I didn't fail, Judge.
I haven't even tried yet.
I've been in
the doctor's office.
Oh! Excuse me. Hold on, Judge.
Mrs. Halsey, Mrs. Krausmeyer.
You're not leaving, are you?
I just remembered
the horse show is today.
- Goodbye.
- It's been jolly.
Won't you join us again
tomorrow night, Mrs. Cummings?
Harvey and I are having a
few people in for Mr. Meegles.
It's very informal, of course.
Forgive me, Mrs. Simmons.
One of my stupid headaches.
Such a lovely party.
Goodbye, goodbye.
- Elwood, I'd like to talk...
- Yes.
- There we are.
- Oh.
I'd like to talk to you, Elwood.
I'd like to talk
to you too, Veta.
This is very important.
Would you mind coming
into the library?
Of course, Veta.
Elwood, I want to talk to you.
Oh.
Elwood, I want you to wait here.
Now don't move.
I'll be right back.
Certainly, Sister.
I happen to have a little
free time right now,
and you're welcome
to all of it, Veta.
You want Harvey to wait, too?
Oh, yes. Yes, Elwood. I certainly do.
<i>Hello! Speak up, I say.</i>
- Did you say something, Harvey?
- Who said that? Who spoke?
<i>Hello! Veta Louise, are you
there? Are you there, girl?</i>
<i>Hello? Veta?</i>
Hello. Who is it, please?
Oh, Judge,
I'm so glad you called.
I was just going to call you.
Oh.
Omar, we've got to take those
steps we discussed once, you know.
Yes. I want you to make
all the arrangements.
Yes. By all means, yes.
That was Omar. We've been
neglecting the judge lately.
Veta, do you know
that it's been weeks
since Harvey and I've
been up to his office?
Let's go tomorrow, shall we?
Elwood, you and I may
take a little ride later.
Oh! I'd like that.
Yes. Only the other day Harvey said,
"You know, it's certainly been a long
time since we've been for a drive."
You're very sweet
and thoughtful.
Now don't forget to wait for
me, Elwood. I'll be right back.
Make yourself
comfortable, Harvey.
There. All right?
Veta wants to talk to us.
She says it's very important.
I think she wants
to congratulate us
on the impression
we made at her party.
Jane Austen.
Sense and Sensibility.
Hmm? Oh...
Random House.
No, no, deluxe edition.
Usual acknowledgements.
Chapter One.
"The family of Dashwood had
been long settled in Sussex."
Will you wait here
for me, Elwood, dear?
You want both of us
to wait, Veta?
Oh, yes, Elwood, both of you.
I won't be long.
Driver, driver, will you
keep an eye on him, please?
I won't be but a minute.
Oh.
Charming place,
isn't it, Harvey?
Name's Henry.
It's Henry, Harvey.
No, just plain Henry.
Oh!
My name's Dowd, Elwood P.
Here, let me give
you one of my cards.
If you should ever want to
call me, call me at this number.
Don't call me at that
one. That's the old one.
If you happen to lose the card,
don't worry, I have plenty more.
Mrs. O. R. Simmons, 348
Temple Drive. Is that right?
Yes. We were born
and raised there.
It's old, but we love it. It's our home.
And you wish to
enter your brother here
at the sanitarium for treatment?
What is your brother's name?
It's... Oh, dear.
Mrs. Simmons, what is
your brother's name?
I'm sorry. Life is
not easy for any of us.
It's Dowd. Elwood P. Dowd.
Elwood P. Dowd. His age?
Forty-two
the 24th of last April.
He's Taurus, Taurus the bull.
I'm Leo, and Myrtle's on the cusp.
You have him with you now?
Oh, yes. He's outside
waiting in a taxi cab.
I told him to wait. He
always does what I tell him.
I see. Is he married?
No, Elwood never married.
He always stayed with Mother.
He was a great home boy.
He loved his home.
Yeah?
Wilson, there's a Mr.
Dowd outside in a cab.
Will you ask him if
he'll be good enough
to step up to Room 24,
South Wing G?
Ask him?
Wilson, this is his
sister, Mrs. Simmons.
Oh! How do?
Why, certainly. I'll
be glad to escort him.
Now I'll see if Dr. Sanderson
can see you, Mrs. Simmons.
Dr. Sanderson? I want to
see Dr. Chumley himself.
Oh, but, Mrs. Simmons, Dr. Sanderson
is the one who sees everybody.
Dr. Chumley sees no one.
I'll tell him you're here.
Isn't this wonderful, Veta?
Okay, buddy.
Oh! Oh! You startled me.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Simmons.
I am Dr. Sanderson.
Miss Kelly tells me
that you're concerned
about your brother, Mr... Mr...
The card, Miss Kelly.
Miss Kelly! The card, please.
Mr. Dowd? Elwood P. Dowd? Yes.
This way, Miss Simmons.
I'm sorry if I awakened you, Miss Kelly.
Oh, I'm so...
I do hope you don't think
I'm always as jumpy as this, but
this is not easy for me, Doctor.
Naturally.
These things aren't easy
for the families of
the patients. I understand.
Won't you sit down,
Miss Simmons?
Thank you.
Now tell me, how long has it
been since you first noticed
any peculiarity in
your brother's actions?
Well, as a baby, he was
perfectly normal.
I know. I was his big sister
and I had to change him.
Babies do need changing, you know.
But I noticed that he
seemed to be different
after we came back
after Mother had died.
Myrtle Mae and I came back from
Des Moines to live with Elwood.
I could see that he...
- That he...
- That he what?
Now take your time.
Don't strain.
Just let it come.
I'll wait for it.
Doctor, everything I say to
you is confidential, isn't it?
I am not a gossip, Mrs.
Simmons. I am a psychiatrist.
Of course.
Well, for one thing, he drinks.
Mmm-hmm. To excess?
To excess?
Well, don't you call it excess
when a man never lets a day go by
without stepping
into some cheap tavern,
bringing home a lot of riffraff,
people you never heard of?
If you don't call
that excess, Doctor,
I'm sure I don't
know what excess is.
I didn't doubt your
statement, Mrs. Simmons.
I merely wanted to know
if your brother drinks.
Well, yes, I say definitely,
Elwood drinks.
Mmm-hmm.
And I want him committed
out here permanently
because I cannot stand
another day of that Harvey!
Don't you think it would have
been a little bit kinder of Mother
if she'd written us about him?
Doctor, now, be honest.
Don't you?
Well, I really couldn't
answer that question.
Well, I can.
Yes, it certainly would have.
Yes.
Now this person that you
call Harvey, now who is he?
He's a rabbit.
Yes, perhaps.
But, uh, just who is he?
Someone your brother picked
up in one of these bars?
Doctor, I've been telling
you, Harvey is a rabbit.
A big white rabbit
six feet high.
Or is it
six-feet-three-and-a-half?
Heaven knows, I ought to know.
He's been around
the house long enough.
Mrs. Simmons,
if I'm not mistaken...
Doctor, don't you understand?
The rabbit's name is Harvey.
Harvey lives at our house.
Elwood buys theatre tickets and
railroad tickets for both of them.
He's lost interest in everything else.
And here I am trying to
get Myrtle Mae started
with a nice group
of young people.
That's my daughter.
Doctor, I'm going
to tell you something
I've never told anyone
in this world before.
Not even Myrtle Mae.
Every once in a while, I see
this big white rabbit myself!
Now isn't that terrible?
And what's more, he's every
bit as big as Elwood says he is!
Now don't ever tell that
to anybody, Doctor.
I'm ashamed of it.
Mrs. Simmons, I can see
that you've been under
a great nervous strain lately.
You just try living
with those two
and see how much
of a strain it is.
Your mother's death, it
depressed you considerably.
Nobody knows how much.
Now, don't you worry, Mrs.
Simmons. I'm going to help you.
Oh, Doctor.
Miss Kelly. Miss Kelly?
Wilson? Wilson!
Now don't you move,
Mrs. Simmons.
You just sit there and
make yourself comfortable.
I'll only be a minute.
Yes.
Wilson? Wilson!
Hello?
Oh, lady, you told me to
keep an eye on that fella,
but a big guy in a
white coat came along...
That's quite all right.
You just wait.
Do you want I should do
something about his suitcase?
Oh!
Elwood's things. Yes, well, I
better come get them, I guess.
He might need them.
Oh, dear, it would be awful
if he should get hurt and...
She picked a fine time
to leave her desk
just when I've got a
new patient in my office.
Mrs. Simmons? Mrs. Simmons!
Sound the gong. Wilson, that poor
woman mustn't leave the grounds.
Made a getaway, huh, Doc?
Her condition is serious. Go after
her and take her to 13 Upper West R.
Right.
Where is she?
That little dame that just
come out here, where'd she go?
She's picking some posies. She wants
to bring them to somebody inside.
- Say, Mac.
- Yeah?
Is it safe for me
to wait around?
I don't see no bars
on these windows.
Don't need them.
Anybody tries to climb
through those windows
will sound like
a three-alarm fire.
Hello, sweetheart.
Well, well. Those for me?
For you? I should say not.
They're for my brother Elwood.
He's devoted to ranunculus.
Sure.
Wouldn't you like to come inside
and pick some off the wallpaper?
No, thank you. These
will do nicely. Good day.
Lady. Come, lady.
- Now, really, I...
- There's a man inside
wants to talk to you.
No, I don't... No!
No! You let me go!
Help! Help! Police!
Now what do we want with
the police, love boat?
They're no fun.
You let me go!
I'm a respectable woman!
That's for sure.
Now come on, lady, be nice
or I'll have to pick
you up and carry you.
Help me! Help! Help! Help!
Dr. Sanderson! Judge Gaffney!
How about giving me
a hand here, beautiful?
I'll sit on her. You can
strip her clothes off.
You'll have to wait, Fisher. I've got
to give some guy a bubble bath.
Okay, honey, but make it snappy.
Somebody...
Somebody... Somebody
help me! Somebody help me!
Doc, that Simmons dame's all
set. Yeah, no trouble at all.
That's fine. I'll be right up
and prescribe some
preliminary treatment.
Don't you ever stay in
your office, Miss Kelly?
I needed you.
I had to give a hypo to Upper 9.
I want you to telephone this
Elwood P. Dowd right away.
His sister's condition
is serious.
But, Doctor, I...
He'll have to sign these
commitment papers for her.
But I didn't know the
woman needed the treatment.
She said it was her brother.
Of course she did. That's
the oldest dodge in the world.
Always used by a cunning
type of psychopath.
She knew her brother
was about to commit her,
so she came here
to discredit him.
Get him on the phone, please.
But, Doctor, I thought
the woman was all right,
so I had Wilson take the brother
up to number 24 South Wing G.
He's there now.
You had Wilson
take the brother in?
Come on, Miss Kelly,
no gags, please.
You're not serious, are you?
I did, Doctor. I did.
Doctor, I'm terribly sorry.
Oh, you're terribly sorry.
That's fine!
That fixes everything!
That's just wonderful!
Oh, no! Kelly! Kelly, do
you realize what you've done?
This man Dowd can sue
us for false commitment!
He can own the whole sanitarium!
And I'll be kicked
outta here faster
than you can say, "Stupid,
incompetent and inefficient."
So I'll tell Dr. Chumley you
had nothing to do with it.
It was all my fault.
You're the last person
in the world
I'd ever want anything
like this to happen to.
You know that, don't you, Dr. Sanderson?
Miss Kelly, this is
hardly the time or place
to go into the balcony
scene from Romeo and Juliet.
Lately, Doctor, there's
never any time or place!
Jeepers! They may be putting
him in the hydro room right now.
Get up there quick and see
if you can get him down here.
I'll break the news
gently to Dr. Chumley.
He may want to
handle this himself.
What shall I say to
Mr. Dowd? What'll I do?
He'll probably be so furious,
he'll refuse to come down here.
Look, Miss Kelly, he's
probably fit to be tied,
but he's a man, isn't he?
I guess so.
His name is "Mister".
Then go into your routine. You
know, the eyes, the swish, the works!
I'm immune to it, but I've
seen it work on some people,
some of the patients out here.
Now you get him
down here, Kelly,
if you have to do a striptease.
Dr. Chumley, I'm afraid
there's been a serious error.
Dr. Sanderson, we don't permit
errors in this institution.
Mr. Dowd?
Elwood P. Here, let me
give you one of my cards.
Mr. Dowd, I'm Miss Kelly.
I'm at the reception desk
downstairs.
I'm happy to know you,
Miss Kelly.
Thank you, Mr. Dowd.
I was wondering if you would
come downstairs with me,
please, to Dr. Sanderson's office.
There's something he'd
like to explain to you.
Uh-huh. I'd be glad to, Miss Kelly.
But there was another very
charming girl in here a minute ago,
and she asked me to wait.
She said something about a bath.
I don't like to disappoint her.
She seemed to have
her heart set on it.
That was Miss Dunphy. It's
quite all right, Mr. Dowd.
Dr. Sanderson will
explain everything...
Here we are.
Mr. Dowd,
you haven't peeled yet.
And I regret this, Miss Dunphy,
but Miss Kelly here seems
to want me to go with her.
Miss Kelly, you've met Miss Dunphy?
Yes, of course.
I want both of you
to meet a very dear...
It seems there's been a
mistake. Just forget everything.
I have a suggestion.
Why don't I do what she
wants and then go with you?
That won't be
necessary, Mr. Dowd.
All right. Goodbye, my dear.
You could've had a bath, too.
I've already had a bath.
Oh, Miss Kelly, I wasn't speaking
to you. I was speaking to my...
Mr. Dowd, I take a bath every
morning just before I go on duty.
It's always such a pleasant
way to start the day.
After you.
Mr. Dowd?
Elwood P.
Here, let me give you
one of my cards.
I am Dr. Lyman Sanderson, Dr.
Chumley's assistant out here. And I...
Good for you. Happy to know you, Doctor.
I asked Miss Kelly to
bring you down here...
Isn't she lovely? Isn't she...
You're very lovely, my dear.
Why, thank you, Mr. Dowd. Some
people don't seem to think so.
Well, some people are blind. That's
very often brought to my attention.
And now I'd like both of you to
meet a very dear friend of mine...
Now why don't we sit down?
Won't you have
a chair, Mr. Dowd?
Oh, thank you very much.
- Please, sit down.
- After Miss Kelly.
No, really, Mr. Dowd.
I couldn't.
I'm in and out all the time.
But you sit down, please.
- After you.
- Sit down, Kelly!
Anything we can do
for you, Mr. Dowd?
What did you have in mind?
- Is your chair comfortable?
- Mmm?
Is the chair quite
comfortable, Mr. Dowd?
Yes. Would you care to try it?
No, no, no, thank you.
How about a cigarette?
- No, thank you.
- Yes, a cigarette...
Mr. Dowd, you have us
at a disadvantage here.
Now you know it and we know it,
so let's lay our cards
on the table.
That certainly appeals
to me, Doctor.
Best thing in the long run. You know,
people are people no matter where you go.
That is very often the case.
And being human, are therefore
liable to make mistakes.
Miss Kelly and I, we've made
a mistake here this afternoon
and we'd like to
explain it to you.
You see, the truth is...
You and Miss Kelly here?
Yes.
Out here this afternoon?
Yes, Mr. Dowd.
We hope you'll understand.
Oh, yes, yes.
These things are often the basis
of a very long, warm friendship.
It wasn't Dr. Sanderson's
fault, Mr. Dowd. It was mine.
Oh, no, the responsibility
is all mine.
Your attitude may be old-fashioned,
Doctor, but I like it,
like it very much.
Of course, if I had
seen your sister first,
this would've been an
entirely different story.
Now there you surprise me.
I think the world
and all of Veta,
but I had supposed
she'd seen her day.
You mustn't attach too
much blame to her, Mr. Dowd.
You see,
she's a very sick woman.
Why, she came in here insisting
that you needed treatment.
That's perfectly ridiculous.
Veta shouldn't be upset
about me. I get along fine.
She was extremely upset
and plunged right away
into a heated tirade
about your drinking.
Ah.
That was Veta.
I tell Veta not to worry about
that. I'll take care of that.
Exactly. I suppose
that you take a drink
now and then,
like the rest of us.
Mmm...
Yes. Yes, I do, Doctor.
As a matter of fact,
I'd like one right now.
As a matter of fact, so would I.
But her reaction to the whole
matter was entirely too intense.
Does she drink, Mr. Dowd?
Oh, no. Oh, no.
No, I don't think Veta's
ever taken a drink, Doctor.
I am going to surprise you.
I think she has
and does constantly.
She... Is that so?
Well, I certainly am
surprised at that.
But her alcoholism isn't
the basis for my diagnosis.
It was when she
became so emotional
about this big
white rabbit, Harvey.
Yes, I believe she
called him Harvey.
Harvey's his name.
Doctor, before we go any
further, I must insist
that you and Miss Kelly allow me
to introduce you to a friend...
Let me make my point,
please, Mr. Dowd.
I think that your sister's
condition stems from trauma.
From what?
Trauma. Spelled T-R-A-U-M-A.
It means shock. There's
nothing unusual about it.
There's the birth trauma,
or the shock of being born.
That's the one
we never get over.
You have a very nice
sense of humour, Mr. Dowd.
- Hasn't he, Miss Kelly?
- Oh, he certainly has.
May I say the same
for both of you.
To sum it up,
your sister's condition
is serious, but I can help her.
She must, however, remain
out here temporarily.
Uh-huh. Well, I've always wanted
Veta to have everything she needs.
Exactly.
But I wouldn't want her
to stay out here
unless she likes it out
here and wants to stay here.
If this were
an ordinary delusion,
something reflected
on the memory picture,
that would be one thing.
But this,
this is much more serious.
It stands to reason no one has ever
seen a white rabbit six feet high.
Not very often, Doctor.
So she must be committed
here temporarily.
Under the circumstances, I'd
commit my own grandmother.
Does your grandmother
drink, too?
That's just an expression.
Now here are the commitment
papers for you to sign,
and here's a visitor's pass.
You can come and see
her whenever you like.
Well, I think maybe you better
have Veta do this, Doctor.
She always does all the signing
and managing for our family.
She's good at it.
I'll have your family
lawyer take care of it.
Judge Gaffney.
He's already telephoned us in
connection with this matter.
- Is that so?
- Yes.
You know, I like you, Dowd.
Well, I like you too, Doctor.
And Miss Kelly here.
I certainly do like you.
Why, thank you, Mr. Dowd.
You two have been so pleasant,
why don't we just
keep on going with it?
I'd like to invite you
to come downtown with me
and we'll go to a charming
little place called Charlie's
and we'll have a drink.
Well, I'm sorry,
but we're on duty now.
Give us a rain check on it.
Some other time,
we'd be glad to.
When?
Well, I can't say offhand.
Miss Kelly and I are on
duty until 10:00 tonight.
10:00 will be fine.
I'll be waiting for you.
It's at 12th and Main.
If we can make it.
I'll be waiting.
The four of us will spend a
very pleasant evening together.
I want both of you
to become friends
with a very dear friend of mine.
- But you said later on, didn't you?
- Yes, yes.
All right, later on it'll be. Goodbye.
Goodbye, Mr. Dowd.
Boy, that was a close shave!
But he seemed like a
reasonable sort of a fellow.
You handled him beautifully,
Doctor. You were wonderful.
Psychology. Specialized
training. Takes years of it.
Good afternoon, Mrs. Chumley.
Good afternoon, Herman.
Stop the car a moment, Leslie.
Yoo-hoo!
Yoo-hoo!
Is there something
I can do for you?
What did you have in mind?
You were walking on my
husband's prized dahlias.
I'm Mrs. Chumley,
Dr. Chumley's wife.
Oh!
Dowd's my name. Elwood P.
Let me give you one of my...
You looking for
someone over there?
Yes. I'm looking
for my friend Harvey.
I turned my back for an instant
and he seems to
have wandered off.
Oh.
I wish you could
meet him, Mrs. Chumley.
I'm sure he'd be
quite taken with you.
Oh, thank you.
You're very nice to say so.
Not at all. Not at all.
Mrs. Chumley, would you care
to come downtown with me?
I'd be happy to buy you a drink.
Oh, I can't. My husband and I
are going to a cocktail party.
Dr. McClure is giving a party
for his sister from Wichita.
Oh. I didn't know Dr. McClure
had a sister in Wichita.
Then you know Dr. McClure?
- No.
- But you...
But are you sure
you wouldn't have time
to come downtown with me
and have a drink?
No, I can't. I'll tell
you what I'll do, however.
What will you do,
however? I'm interested.
If I meet your friend inside,
I'll be glad to give
him a message for you.
Would you do that for me? I
certainly would appreciate that.
Just tell him to meet me
downtown, if he has no other plans.
Any particular place downtown?
No, he knows where.
Harvey knows this town
like a book.
But how will I
recognize your friend?
You can't miss him, Mrs.
Chumley. He's a pooka.
A pooka? Is that something new?
No, no. As I understand it,
that's something very old.
But Harvey's not only a pooka,
he's also my best friend.
If Harvey's said to me once,
I'll bet he's said, oh,
probably a million times,
he said, "Mr. Dowd, I
would do anything for you."
How sweet.
Yeah. He's also very
fond of my sister Veta.
But Veta doesn't seem
to care for Harvey.
Now don't you think that's
rather too bad, Mrs. Chumley?
I don't know, Mr. Dowd.
I gave up long ago expecting
my family to like my friends.
It's useless.
We must keep on trying
though, mustn't we?
- Oh, yes.
- Goodbye, my dear.
Goodbye.
Leslie, did he say, "pooka"?
Yes, ma'am. That's what the man said.
- Your pass?
- Oh.
There you are.
- Dowd.
- Elwood P.
Isn't that interesting.
Yes, I constructed this myself.
Is that so? I declare.
It's very simple. See?
Closed.
Opened.
You're a very brilliant man.
Thank you.
My name is Herman Shimelplatzer,
but everybody
just calls me Herman.
You're to be congratulated,
Mr. Shimelplatzer.
Thank you.
Would you care to come over to my
house for dinner tomorrow night?
I'm having a few friends
in, just informally.
I certainly would. That's
very nice of you, Mr. Dowd.
Here, let me give you
one of my cards.
Now if you should want to call
me, call me at this number.
Don't call me at that one.
That's the old one. Goodbye.
That's remarkable.
I hate to take you
away like this, Willie,
but we did promise Dr.
McClure we'd be there early.
One moment, angel. My
hat and coat, Miss Kelly.
Yes, Dr. Chumley.
- Dr. Sanderson.
- Yes, Doctor?
I'm leaving for the day.
About the difficulty of this
woman with the big white rabbit.
Has it been smoothed over?
- Yes, Doctor.
- Good.
While I've had many patients
out here with animals,
I've never before had a patient
with an animal that large.
Yes, Doctor.
She called him Harvey.
Unusual name for an animal of any kind.
I want her to have a hypo at
6:00, with another one at 9:00.
Willie...
Yes, yes, I'm coming.
My formula, 9-7-7.
- Yes, Doctor.
- Listen, Willie...
Hey, now look.
Now somebody's gonna have to give
me a hand with that Simmons dame.
She's terrible!
I had to take her
corset off all by myself.
Hiya, Dr. Chumley.
How's every little...
Hey, what's with you and that hat?
- Hat?
- Here's your hat, Dr. Chumley.
I'm wearing my hat.
Willie, dear, a few minutes
ago, there was something...
This isn't my hat.
Must be yours, Doctor.
No, Doctor, mine is...
Mine is...
Of course it's not yours.
Angel, I'd like to say...
No, dear,
of course it's not yours.
- But whose hat is it?
- He won't let me talk.
Look at this.
Two holes cut in the crown.
It's probably some new fad.
Perhaps Mr. Dowd left
it here, sir.
- Dowd?
- Yes, see, that's what I...
That's Mrs. Simmons' brother,
Doctor. I gave him a pass.
Willie, dear, that's what
I've been trying to tell you.
A few minutes ago, I met
a gentleman at the gate.
His name was Dowd.
He said he was looking for
a friend of his named Harvey.
Harvey?
Yes. Yes, Harvey.
Holy smoke!
I left the water running
on that Simmons dame
in a hydro tub!
Why are you looking
at me like that, Willie?
He was a nice, polite man.
He said his friend was a
pooka. Whatever that is.
Give me Upper West R, quick.
Where did he go, Mrs. Chumley?
He went downtown.
Hello, Dunphy, I left that
Simmons dame soaking in 13.
Do me a favour, will you,
honey? Turn off the juice.
So you gave him
a pass, Dr. Sanderson.
Perhaps they neglected to
tell you at medical school
that a rabbit has
large pointed ears?
Do you know what you've done?
You've allowed a psychopathic
case to walk out of here
and roam around with an
overgrown white rabbit!
You've laid me open
to a lawsuit.
I shall have to do something
I haven't done for 15 years.
I'll have to go after this
man, Dowd, and bring him back!
But when I do, Dr. Sanderson,
your connection
with this institution
will have ended
as of that moment.
- Wilson, get the car.
- Yeah, Doctor.
I'm sorry, pet, but you'll have
to go to the McClures' without me.
Take a cab. You two, get
that woman out of the tub!
- Yes, sir.
- Willie?
I'm going to call my attorney.
- Wilson.
- Yes, ma'am.
- What's a pooka?
- What's a what?
A pooka.
- A pooka?
- Uh-huh.
You can search me, Mrs. Chumley.
P.
O.
Poo...
Pooka!
Oh, dear, I'm already
late for the McClures'.
I did promise them
I'd be on time.
"P-O-O-K-A.
"Pooka. From old
Celtic mythology.
"A fairy spirit in animal form.
"Always very large.
"The pooka appears
here and there,
"now and then,
"to this one and that one.
"A benign but
mischievous creature.
"Very fond of rumpots,
crackpots.
"And how are you, Mr. Wilson?"
"How are you, Mr. Wilson"?
Who in the encyclopedia
wants to know?
Wilson, let's go.
Dr. Chumley,
the screwiest thing...
I know, I know, and
believe me, heads will roll.
But, Dr. Chumley,
I was looking...
Quick, downtown. Step on it.
Where's your mother?
Where is she?
She took Uncle Elwood out to the
sanitarium. I thought you knew.
She just called me on the phone
at the club. She's hysterical.
- Where's your phone?
- In the library.
What on Earth was
Mother hysterical about?
I don't know. I couldn't make
out what she was talking about.
She was carrying
on something fierce.
Where's the number
of that sanitarium?
I'll look it up, but I don't know
what Mother had to carry on about.
All she had to do was have
Uncle Elwood locked up.
Maybe that's it.
You know, I feel bad about
having Elwood locked up.
I always liked that boy.
He could've done
anything, been anything,
made a place for
himself in the community.
And all he did was
get a big rabbit.
Yeah, I know.
He's had that rabbit
up in my office many a time.
I'm old, but I don't miss much.
What's the name of this
place? Chumley's what?
Chumley's Rest.
Yeah, Elwood had everything.
Brains, personality and friends.
Men liked him. Women
liked him. I liked him.
Women liked him? Uncle Elwood?
- Mother!
- Myrtle!
Veta Louise!
What's wrong, girl?
I thought I'd never
see either of you again.
Take hold of her, Judge. She
looks like she's going to faint.
- Not so fast.
- Don't rush her, Myrtle. Ease her in.
Get me where I can sit down.
There you are, girl.
Get her some tea, Myrtle.
Let me sit down somewhere.
I'll get you some tea,
Mother. Do you want some tea?
No. I don't want any tea.
The minute
their backs were turned,
I ran like a frightened rabbit.
Oh, I didn't mean to say that!
I don't know what I'm saying.
Just let me sit here.
Let me get my breath.
Let her get her breath.
Let me get my breath
and then let me get upstairs to
my own bed where I can let go.
Mother, what happened to you?
Omar, I want you to sue them.
They put me in
and let Elwood out.
- What's this?
- Mother!
As I was going down to the
taxi cab to get Elwood's things,
this awful man stepped out.
He was a white slaver,
I know he was.
He was wearing one of those white
suits. That's how they advertise.
The man, what did he do?
What did he do?
He grabbed hold of me and he
took me in there, and he...
Oh.
Go on, Veta. Go on, girl.
Mother... Go on, Mother.
Was he a young man?
Myrtle Mae, perhaps you'd
better leave the room.
Now? I should say not.
Go on, Mother.
What'd he do, Veta?
He took me upstairs and
he tore my clothes off.
Did you hear that,
Judge? Go on, Mother.
And then he dumped me
down in a tub of water.
Oh, for heaven's sake!
By Godfrey,
I'll sue them for this!
I always thought that what
you were showed in your face.
Don't you believe it, Judge,
don't you believe it,
Myrtle Mae.
That man grabbed hold of me
as though I was
a woman of the streets.
But I fought.
I always said that if a
man jumped at me, I'd fight.
Haven't I always
said that, Myrtle Mae?
Yes, she's always
said that, Judge.
That's what Mother's
always told me to do.
Well, he hustled me
into the sanitarium
and dumped me down
in that tub of water
and treated me as
though I was a...
A what?
A crazy woman. But he
did that just for spite.
Well, I'll be swizzled!
And then one of those doctors
came upstairs and asked
me a lot of questions.
All about sex urges
and all that filthy stuff.
That place ought to
be cleaned up, Judge.
You ought to get the
authorities to clean it up.
Don't you ever go out there.
You hear me, Myrtle Mae?
This stinks to high heaven,
girl. By Godfrey, it stinks.
Judge Gaffney, is that all those
doctors do in places like that,
- think about sex?
- I don't know.
Because if it is, they ought
to be ashamed of themselves.
It's all in their heads anyway.
Why don't they get out and take
long walks in the fresh air?
Judge Gaffney walked everywhere
for years, didn't you, Judge?
Did you?
I better take
some notes on this.
You said one of the doctors
came up to talk to you?
Yes. Dr. Sanderson.
But don't pay any attention
to anything he says.
He's a liar. Close-set
eyes. They're always liars.
Besides, I told him something
in strictest confidence
and he blabbed it.
You can't trust anyone!
What did you tell him, Mother?
Well, I... What difference does it make?
I don't want to think about it.
I don't want to talk about it.
Anything you told Dr. Sanderson,
you can tell us, Veta Louise.
This is your daughter,
and I'm your lawyer.
I know which is which.
I don't want to talk about
it. I want to sue them.
And I want to get
upstairs to my own bed.
I should never have tried
to do anything about Elwood.
Something protects him.
That awful pooka.
Where is Uncle Elwood?
How should I know?
They let him go!
They're not interested in
men at places like that.
You ought to know that,
Myrtle Mae. Don't be so naive.
Mother, no matter
who jumped at you,
we still have to find Uncle
Elwood and lock him up.
The next time,
you take him, Judge.
Oh, wait till Elwood hears what they
did to me. He won't stand for it.
You've got to sue them, Judge.
Myrtle Mae, I hope that never,
never, as long as you live,
a man tears the clothes off you
and sets you down
in a tub of water.
There he is! There he is now!
- He's after me!
- Stay where you are, young man!
Knock him down, Judge. Kick him!
Kick him! Don't let him get me!
Veta, please. I want you to
confront this man with your charges.
Hey, I don't want no
part of that wacky dame.
I'm looking for
that other screwball.
He's gotta go back
to Chumley's Rest.
Kick him, Judge!
Veta, did you hear that?
Did you hear that, Veta?
Where is he?
Where is this guy,
Elwood P. Dowd?
That screwball with a rabbit.
What's the matter,
you goofy too?
You a member of
this cock-eyed family?
I'm Mrs. Simmons' daughter
and Uncle Elwood is my uncle.
Now look, kid,
I've been to four fires
and 14 gin mills looking
for that crackpot,
and a bartender give
me a tip he was here.
Came with a bundle.
Now, where is he? What'd you
do with him? You hiding him?
No, I'm not hiding him.
Hey, my name's Marvin
Wilson, honey. What's yours?
Myrtle Mae. And I'm not afraid of you.
- Myrtle Mae, huh?
- Yeah.
You know, if we grab your uncle,
you'll probably be coming out
to the sanitarium
on visiting days.
Really, I don't know...
Well, if you do, I'll be there.
You will?
If you don't see me right away,
stick around for a little while.
I'll show up.
- Won't you sit down?
- I got no time, kid.
I gotta find that uncle
of yours and be on my way.
Now, where is he?
Where'd you put him?
I didn't put him anywhere.
I want you to catch him just as
much as you want to catch him.
I can't even have any
callers when he's around.
You shouldn't have any
trouble about callers, honey.
Thank you very much.
- Yeah, I'll tell you something, Myrt.
- Yeah?
You not only got a nice build,
but you got something else, too.
Really? What?
You got the screwiest uncle
that ever stuck his puss
inside our nuthouse.
Would you like a cup of coffee?
Yeah, I can't, kid. Dr. Chumley's
checking all the police stations.
I better catch up with him.
You look awfully hungry, Mr. Wilson.
How about a sandwich?
Yeah, but I don't want
that crazy dame on my neck.
Don't worry about Mother. She
won't come down right away.
She's too frightened. Would
you like a ham and rye?
How about an egg and onion?
I'd love to make you
an egg and onion.
The eggs and onions are
waiting for you in the kitchen.
Suppose we go in the
kitchen, Mr. Wilson.
You can relax and
be yourself in there.
Do you like your work,
Mr. Wilson?
I do now, Myrtle, I do now!
Charlie's Place?
Oh, Mr. Cracker.
Mr. Cracker, this is
Elwood P. Dowd speaking.
Tell me, have you seen Harvey?
Uh-huh.
Well, don't worry.
I'll find him.
And Mr. Cracker,
I'm entertaining
some friends down there
tonight at 10:00.
May I have my regular booth?
Oh, fine. Thank you. Goodbye.
Harvey!
Harvey?
- Hello?
- Come on, Myrtle.
Don't you wanna come back in
the kitchen and get acquainted?
- I thought I heard voices.
- Come on.
What kind of voices?
Come on, Myrtle,
I wanna talk to you.
It sounded something
like, "Harvey."
"Harvey"? Well, I'd
better get going, Myrtle.
But, Marvin, you haven't
finished your egg and onion.
Business before pleasure, honey,
even if it's a pleasure
being with you.
You make a great
egg and onion, kid.
Don't you want to come back
to the kitchen for some more?
I'll see you tomorrow,
Myrtle, out at the nuthouse.
But, Marvin, you didn't
finish your sandwich.
Wilson! What happened to you?
- He's not here, Doctor.
- Then what are you doing here?
- I was just having a little...
- What are you eating?
An egg and onion sandwich.
How can you think of
food at a time like this?
Get over to Union Station.
I'm told this fellow Dowd goes
down there to watch trains.
- Yeah, all right, Doctor.
- But, Marvin...
Why did you send him away?
Some people can certainly
pick the best times
to keep other people
from becoming acquainted.
No, my dear...
Oh, Judge Gaffney.
Chumley, just the man I want to see.
Mrs. Simmons has just retained
me to file suit against you.
You know, I've been searching...
File suit?
I'm on my way to the office to
draw up the necessary papers.
Judge Gaffney, what happened this
afternoon was an unfortunate mistake,
but I've dismissed
my assistant...
We shall see what we shall see.
Now, please, there must be some way...
You'll hear from me in
the morning. Goodbye.
But surely, Judge...
This is most unfortunate.
Most unfortunate.
Oh, Judge Gaffney?
Judge Gaffney, I want...
Why, you're not Judge Gaffney.
You have much more hair
than he has.
Besides, I never forget a face.
I'm Dr. Chumley. You're
Mrs. Simmons, of course.
Yes, of course. I'm glad
to know you, Dr. Chumley.
Would you mind asking
Judge Gaffney to come back?
Why, certainly. Certainly.
I want to tell him to
sue you for $100,000.
I don't think 50,000 is enough.
Mrs. Simmons, can't we
talk this matter over?
After what happened to me today
in the bathtub and everything?
I don't want to talk it over!
Then will you
please just listen?
I don't want to listen
to you. I'm suing you.
Mrs. Simmons, please
listen to me, I beg of you.
I'll listen, all right.
But I'm warning you,
it won't do you any good.
Hello.
No, I am not
listening to my radio.
I am listening to Dr. Chumley.
I just told him so.
Mrs. Simmons, that
picture over the mantle?
That portrait of
my mother, Doctor,
happens to be the pride of this house.
Who painted it?
Oh, some man. I forget his name.
He was around here
for the sittings
and then we paid him
and he went away.
Yes, I suppose if
you have the money,
you can persuade people
to do anything.
Now, Dr. Chumley,
you brought this up.
You might as well
learn something quickly.
I took a course
in art last winter.
I learned the difference
between a fine oil painting
and a mechanical thing,
like a photograph.
The photograph
shows only the reality.
The painting shows not only the
reality, but the dream behind it.
It's our dreams, Doctor,
that carry us on.
They separate us
from the beasts.
I wouldn't want to go on living
if I thought it was all
just eating and sleeping
and taking my clothes off.
I mean, putting them on.
Oh, Doctor!
Mrs. Simmons, steady now,
steady. Don't upset yourself.
Everything's going to be
all right. What's the matter?
Doctor, that is not my mother!
I'm very glad to hear that.
Elwood's been here.
He's been here, Doctor!
Now, now, better be quiet.
I'll take it.
Hello? Yes? Yes. Who's calling?
He's here! It's your brother!
Let me talk to him.
Now be careful. Don't let him
know that I'm here. Be casual.
Yes. Yes, I'll be casual. Yes.
Yes. Yes.
Hello, Elwood.
Where are you, dear?
I'm here, Veta.
Is Harvey there?
He won't say where he is. He
wants to know if Harvey's here.
Tell him Harvey is here.
But he isn't.
I know that, but pretend he is.
Say he is.
We've got to humour him.
Hello, Elwood. Yes, dear, Harvey's here.
Why don't you come home?
It won't work. He wants us to
call Harvey to the telephone.
Say Harvey's here,
but he can't come
to the phone because
he's in the bathtub.
Oh, Doctor!
You've got to do it,
Mrs. Simmons.
Elwood, yes, dear,
Harvey is here,
but he can't come
to the telephone.
He's in the bathtub.
I'll send him over as soon as
he's dry. Where are you, dear?
I'm... I'm...
Never mind, Veta. Harvey just
walked in the door down here.
Yeah...
Mr. Cracker, two Martinis.
Goodbye, Veta.
You'd better look in the
bathtub. It must be a stranger.
He says that Harvey just
walked through the door.
It must be a stranger
in the bathtub.
But I know where he is.
He's at Charlie's Place.
That's a bar over
at 12th and Main.
12th and Main. That's
two over and one down.
Yes. Where are you going, Doctor?
I'm going to go over and get
your brother and bring him back.
Take him to the sanitarium
where he belongs.
I want to observe the
expression on his face
when he talks to this rabbit.
- He does talk to the rabbit?
- They tell each other everything.
Good. What?
I said, yes, he talks to him.
But, Doctor, don't go out there.
You'll regret it if you do.
Nonsense, Mrs. Simmons.
You underestimate me.
No, no, you underestimate my brother.
Don't worry. I can handle him.
You can handle him?
That's what you think.
Myrtle Mae, see who the
stranger is in the bathtub.
Oh.
Sounds funny, but I'll miss this place.
I guess I'll miss a lot
of things around here.
You will?
You won't laugh?
Of course not.
You know how it is working
around people day after day.
You sort of
get attached to them.
I know, Lyman.
It may be ridiculous,
but I'm gonna miss
every one of the psychos and the
neuros and schizos in the place.
I guess I'll even
miss Dr. Chumley.
In spite of the fact
that he fired me,
I have a genuine
admiration for him.
You can miss your psychos
and schizos, Dr. Sanderson!
You can miss
whomever you please.
But after you leave here,
I won't miss a thing,
not a single, solitary thing!
- Now what's wrong?
- Nothing.
I came down here to
say goodbye to you.
So goodbye, good luck and good riddance!
You can't even say goodbye without
putting it on a personal basis.
Oh, don't flatter
yourself, Doctor.
There's nothing
personal about this.
I think you've been working too
hard, Kelly. You're getting neurotic.
Now don't start analysing me.
Save your psychiatry
for your next job!
I'm not using psychiatry, Miss Kelly.
And let me give you
a little friendly advice.
That chip on your shoulder
stems from a persecution complex
that undoubtedly
goes back to childhood.
Thanks so much for the
case history, Doctor.
Now could you tell me what an
overinflated ego stems from?
Now, listen here!
Hiya, Kelly. Hiya, Doc.
Hey, I'm glad I caught
you before you left.
I'm sorry you got bounced,
and I wanna tell you
we're all gonna miss you.
Thanks, Wilson.
Any of the patients
been acting up, Kelly?
Everything's just peachy.
That's good. When are
you taking off, Doc?
Right now. I was just waiting
for Dr. Chumley to get back.
Hey, wait a second.
Didn't Dr. Chumley come
back here with that psycho?
We thought he was with you.
No. I left him with
that Simmons dame.
Then when I called back
later to check with him,
she told me the doctor
went to bring her b...
Hey, that was four hours ago!
Have you any idea where he went?
- Yeah. No!
- Come on, come on.
I don't know. I can't
think. Poor Dr. Chumley
may be laying in an alley
in a pool of blood.
But Mr. Dowd seemed harmless
enough this afternoon.
Listen, Kelly, I've been
wrestling these guys for years,
and they're pretty tricky.
You know, one minute they're
sweet, and the next minute,
They give you the knife.
- The name of the place, Wilson.
- The name of the place?
- Yes.
- It was a barroom, had a guy's name.
Charlie! Charlie's Place. I remember...
That's a lead.
We'll start from there.
Never mind, Dr. Sanderson. I'll
go with Wilson. You needn't bother.
Now listen, Kelly, until
Dr. Chumley comes back,
I'm still in charge here.
All right, but let's get going.
Let's not stand
and argue about it.
Ow.
Yeah, this is the place.
Well, what'll it be, folks?
We're looking
for someone, two men.
Yeah, a tall, short one
and a thin, fat one.
I'm so nervous, I don't
know what I'm saying.
One man is short
and middle-aged.
The other is much
taller and younger.
They might have been
here about four hours ago.
No, can't say that I have.
We've been running
medium sizes all evening.
The tall man was soft-spoken
and sort of polite.
His name is Dowd.
Oh, Dowd? Why didn't you say so?
He's here now in the back booth.
Is he alone?
There's two schools
of thought, sir.
If that crackpot did anything to Dr.
Chumley, I'll knock his teeth down...
No rough stuff, Wilson.
Psychology. I'll do the talking.
Well, I've been expecting you.
Where's the doctor?
What'd you do with him?
Wilson!
Wilson, why don't you take a
careful look around the place?
Why don't you
do that, Mr. Wilson?
Although I don't
believe it's for sale.
Miss Kelly, these are for you.
Why, thank you, Mr. Dowd.
A pleasure, my dear.
You know, Doctor, after
what happened this afternoon,
these flowers really should
be from you, shouldn't they?
Now, won't you join me?
Oh, Mr. Dowd, I'm
afraid we can't do that.
The situation has changed
since this afternoon,
but I urge you to
have no resentment.
Dr. Chumley is your friend
and he only wants to help you.
Isn't that nice. I'd be
very glad to help him.
We all must face reality,
Dowd, sooner or later.
Uh-huh.
Well, I wrestled with reality
for 35 years, Doctor.
And I'm happy to state
I finally won out over it.
Mr. Dowd, where is Dr. Chumley?
Not knowing, I cannot say. Wish I could.
Miss Kelly, I don't
like to see you standing.
- Sit down, Kelly.
- Would you...
There we are. Now,
let's all have a drink.
Dr. Chumley did come in here
to get you earlier this evening.
Yes. Yes, he did. And I
was delighted to see him.
What'll it be, Mr. Dowd?
Martinis?
But that was four hours ago.
Where has the evening gone to?
Four... Three Martinis, Mr. Cracker.
Hey, I've looked
all over this joint.
There's no sign of the doctor.
- What'd you do to him?
- That's what we're trying to find out.
What happened then, Mr. Dowd?
Well, I then introduced
Harvey to the doctor,
and he sat down
in the booth with us.
Let's see.
Harvey was sitting here,
and the doctor sat opposite
Harvey so he could look at him.
Who's Harvey?
A white rabbit, six feet tall.
Six feet?
Six feet, three
and a half inches.
Now let's stick to the facts.
Now what happened after you
introduced Dr. Chumley to Harvey?
Well, Harvey suggested
that I buy him a drink.
And knowing that he
doesn't like to drink alone,
I suggested to Dr.
Chumley that we join him.
Yes.
- We joined him.
- Go on.
- We joined him again.
- Yeah, then what?
And then the other matter came up.
Yeah, now we're getting
somewhere. What other matter?
Mr. Wilson, I don't
like to see you standing.
- Wouldn't you join us here?
- Who, me?
Sit down, will you, Wilson?
Sit right down here.
You say this other
matter came up, Mr. Dowd.
Yes. There was a beautiful blonde
woman, name of Mrs. Smethills,
and her escort, seated in the
booth directly across from us.
Well Dr. Chumley went over
to sit next to her,
explaining to her that they
had once met in Chicago.
Then her escort escorted Dr.
Chumley back here to Harvey and me,
and tried to point out that it
would be better for Dr. Chumley
to mind his own affairs.
Does he have any?
Does he have any what?
- Does he have any affairs?
- How would I know?
Shut up, Wilson!
Go on, Mr. Dowd.
Well... Thank you, Mr. Cracker.
Mrs. Smethills' escort seemed
to get more and more depressed
as he kept looking
at Dr. Chumley.
So Harvey and I felt
that we should
take the doctor somewhere else.
Harvey suggested
Blondie's Chicken Inn,
but the doctor wanted
to go to Eddie's.
And while they were
arguing about it,
I went up to the bar
to order another drink.
And when I came back
here, they were gone.
You don't believe that story
about the doctor sitting here,
talking to a big
white rabbit, do you?
Well, why not? Harvey was here.
At first, Dr. Chumley seemed
a little frightened of Harvey,
but that gave way to admiration
as the evening wore on.
"The evening wore on."
That's a very nice expression, isn't it?
With your permission,
I'll say it again.
"The evening wore on."
And with your permission, I'm
gonna knock your brains out.
Now look, you did
something to Dr. Chumley,
and I'm gonna
find out what it is.
Stop it! Lyman!
Wilson! For heaven's sake!
- All right! Want me to go outside?
- All right!
Mr. Cracker? Mr. Cracker?
Sure, Mr. Dowd.
Mr. Cracker, may I
intercede for my friends?
Youth and high spirits.
Time will take care of that.
Sure, Mr. Dowd.
Okay, boys, let them go. Let them go.
If Mr. Dowd vouches
for you, okay.
One more peep out
of you, Wisenheimer,
and I'll butter your necktie.
- Yeah, fine.
- All right, get back to your dancing.
Well, stimulating as all this is,
I think we all should
have our drinks.
Here, Miss Kelly, sit down.
Here we are. Dr. Sanderson.
You keep your eye on him. I'm gonna
check in those other two joints.
And Dr. Chumley better
be there, pal, or else!
- Mr. Wilson?
- Yeah?
- Goodbye, Mr. Wilson.
- Goodbye.
My regards to you and anybody
else you happen to run into.
Mr. Dowd, can't you
think of anything else
that might help us
to find the doctor?
Miss Kelly, may I
take hold of your hand?
Yes, Mr. Dowd, if you want to.
We're all so worried.
Please try to think. Please?
For you, I'd do anything.
I'd almost be willing to
live my life over again.
Almost. But I've told it all.
You're sure?
I'm quite sure.
But ask me again anyway,
won't you?
I liked that warm tone you
had in your voice just then.
So did I.
Maybe we better
go someplace else.
Miss Kelly seems to
be a little unhappy.
No, let's stay here.
Kelly's all right.
Perhaps you'd like
to dance, Miss Kelly.
All right, Mr. Dowd,
if you'd like to.
Oh, not I. No.
I used to dance. I
haven't danced in years.
I'm sure Dr. Sanderson
would love to dance
with somebody
as lovely as you. Hmm?
Would you, Miss Kelly?
- All right.
- There we are.
It's been a long time
since we've danced together.
Yes, a long time.
I'd forgotten what a
wonderful dancer you were.
If we didn't have
to humour Mr. Dowd,
you wouldn't have
remembered at all.
I'm not dancing with you
to humour Mr. Dowd, Ruth.
We shouldn't
have left him alone!
Where are you going, Mr. Dowd?
I was just looking for someone.
Why don't you come back inside?
All right, if you want me to.
It seemed to be
so pleasant out here.
You two look very nice
dancing together.
I used to know
a whole lot of dances.
The Flea Hop.
And what's the...
Black Bottom. The Varsity Drag.
I don't know. I just don't
seem to have any time anymore.
I have so many things to do.
What is it you do, Mr. Dowd?
Harvey and I sit in the bars
have a drink or two,
play the jukebox.
And soon the faces of
all the other people,
they turn toward mine
and they smile.
And they're saying, "We
don't know your name, mister,
"but you're a very nice fellow."
Harvey and I
warm ourselves in
all these golden moments.
We've entered as strangers.
Soon we have friends.
And they come over
and they sit with us,
and they drink with us,
and they talk to us.
They tell about the big,
terrible things they've done
and the big, wonderful
things they'll do.
Their hopes and their regrets,
their loves and their hates,
all very large
because nobody ever brings
anything small into a bar.
And then
I introduce them to Harvey.
And he's bigger and grander
than anything they offer me.
And...
And when they leave,
they leave impressed.
The same people
seldom come back,
but that's...
That's envy, my dear.
There's a little bit of
envy in the best of us.
And that's too bad, isn't it?
How did you happen
to call him Harvey?
Harvey's his name.
How do you know that?
There was a rather interesting
coincidence on that, Doctor.
One night, several years ago,
I was walking early in the
evening down along Fairfax Street.
It was between 18th and 19th.
I... Do you know the block?
Yes, yes.
I'd just put Ed Hickey
into a taxi.
Ed had been mixing his
rye with his gin, and he...
I just felt that
he needed conveying.
Anyway, I was walking
down along the street
and I heard this voice saying,
"Good evening, Mr. Dowd."
Well, I turned around
and here was this
big six-foot rabbit,
leaning up against a lamppost.
I thought nothing of that because
when you've lived in a town
as long as I've lived
in this one,
you get used to the fact that
everybody knows your name.
Naturally, I went over to chat with him.
And he said to me, he said,
"Ed Hickey was a little
spiffed this evening.
"Or could I be mistaken?"
Of course, he was not mistaken.
I think the world and all
of Ed, but he was spiffed.
We talked like that for a
while and then I said to him,
I said,
"You have the advantage on me.
"You know my name
and I don't know yours."
And right back at me, he said,
"What name do you like?"
Well, I didn't even have
to think twice about that.
Harvey's always
been my favourite name.
So I said to him,
I said, "Harvey".
And, uh...
This is the interesting
thing about the whole thing.
He said, "What a coincidence.
"My name happens to be Harvey."
Dowd,
what was your father's name?
John. John Stuyvesant.
Tell me, Dowd,
when you were a child,
didn't you have a playmate?
Someone with whom you
spent many happy hours?
Yes. Yes, I did, Doctor.
- Didn't you?
- Yes.
What was his name?
Vern. Vern McElhinney.
- You ever know the McElhinneys, Doctor?
- No.
That's too bad. There were a
lot of them and they circulated.
Very nice people.
Just wonderful people.
Think carefully, Dowd.
Didn't you know
somebody sometime,
someplace,
by the name of Harvey?
Didn't you ever know
anybody by that name?
No.
No, not one, Doctor.
Maybe that's why I always
had such hopes for it.
Hey, we looked in
both of those joints,
and Dr. Chumley ain't
in either one of them.
I brought help. What're
you doing out here?
Come on. We're going
back to the sanitarium.
Come, Elwood.
Very well, Lyman.
I'm afraid I won't be able to
stay very long. I must find Harvey.
Which one is Dowd?
My name's Dowd, Elwood P.
Here, let me give you
one of my cards.
Never mind the card!
Wilson, what did I tell you?
Coming, coming.
- Who is it?
- It's me. Open the gates quickly.
Oh! It's you, Doctor!
I thought you'd gone for the
night, Doctor. I thought you'd gone.
Close them, Herman. Close
them. Close the gates.
Are you all right, Doctor?
I'm being followed.
Who's following you?
None of your business.
Huh?
- You called me, Doctor?
- No.
No, I didn't. No.
Everything's fine.
What's wrong?
What happened, Herman?
What's going on?
The alarm went off. Somebody
must've come through a window.
- Yes, Doctor.
- Sanderson, he's after me.
Who's after you, Doctor?
I don't see anyone.
I saw him. He came through the
window, followed me through it.
Who was it, Doctor?
Who came through
the window, Doctor?
- I won't tell you.
- What's he talking about?
Forget it.
I'm going to my office and
I don't wish to be disturbed.
"Forget it," he says. Not me.
I'm taking a look
around this joint.
I'm gonna see what's going on.
- It's locked.
- Locked?
Have you any extra keys, miss?
Yes. Yes, we have.
I'll get them.
Dr. Chumley,
I went around the house
and climbed in
through the window.
I didn't see anybody.
Thank you, Wilson.
It's quite all right.
Everything's in order,
thank you. I'll be all right.
Dr. Chumley,
if you need me, I'll...
Holy smoke! We forgot
about that crackpot.
He's probably
roaming around loose!
- Excuse me.
- Oh.
I got him, Doctor. All right,
buddy, let's go upstairs.
I wanna do your
fingernails for you.
Very thoughtful of you.
Just a second, Wilson.
I'll take him.
Thank you, Doctor.
Oh...
Miss Kelly.
Miss Kelly, perhaps
you'd like this flower.
I seem to have misplaced my buttonhole.
- Thank you, Mr. Dowd.
- Okay, let's go.
One moment, please.
Dr. Chumley. How nice
to run into you again.
Tell me, how are you
getting along with Harvey?
Well...
Mr. Dowd, I'd like to speak to
you in my office alone, please.
Well, I'd like that too, Doctor,
but I just promised this gentleman
he could give me a manicure.
Of course, if you wouldn't mind
waiting for few minutes, Mr. Wilson?
No, not at all,
Mr. Dowd. Not at all.
Oh. Excuse me. You first.
Oh. Okay. Fine.
Mr. Dowd, won't you have a seat?
Thank you.
Will you have a cigar?
No, thank you, Doctor.
Is there anything
I can do for you?
What did you have in mind?
Mr. Dowd, what kind of a man
are you? Where do you come from?
Didn't I give you
one of my cards?
And where on the face
of this tired old Earth
did you find a thing like him?
You mean Harvey, the pooka?
Yes, it's true, the
things you told me tonight.
- I know it now.
- Yeah, yeah.
Yes, Harvey has several
very interesting facets.
Did I tell you
about Mrs. McElhinney?
No.
She lives right next door
to us. Wonderful woman.
Well, Harvey told me last night that
Mrs. McElhinney's Aunt Rose
was going to drop in
on her unexpectedly
this morning from Cleveland.
And did she?
Did she what?
Aunt Rose. Did she come,
just as Harvey said she would?
Oh, yes, yes.
Yes, these things
always work out
just the way
Harvey says they will.
He's very, very versatile.
Did I tell you
he could stop clocks?
To what purpose?
You've heard the expression,
"His face would stop a clock."
Well, Harvey can look
at your clock and stop it.
And you can go anywhere you
like with anyone you like
and stay as long as you like.
And when you get back, not
one minute will have ticked by.
- You mean that he...
- You see...
He can...
You see, science has
overcome time and space.
But Harvey has overcome
not only time and space,
but any objections.
Flyspecks! Flyspecks!
I've been spending
my life among flyspecks
while miracles have been leaning
on lampposts at
18th and Fairfax.
Tell me, Mr. Dowd,
will he do this for you?
Oh, he'd be willing at any time.
But so far I haven't been able to
think of anyplace I'd rather be.
I always have a wonderful time
wherever I am,
whomever I'm with.
I'm having a fine time
right here with you, Doctor.
Oh. Oh, I...
I know where I'd go.
Where?
I'd go to Akron.
Akron. Oh, yeah.
There's a cottage camp just outside
Akron in a grove of maple trees.
Green, cool, beautiful.
That's my favourite tree.
I'd go there
with a pretty woman.
Oh.
A strange woman, a quiet woman.
Oh. Under a tree.
I wouldn't even want
to know her name,
while I would be just Mr. Smith.
And I would send out
for cold beer.
- No whiskey, huh?
- No.
Then I would tell her things.
Things that I've
never told to anyone.
Things that are
locked deep in here.
And as I talked to her,
I would want her to hold out
her soft white hand and say,
"Poor thing.
You poor, poor thing."
For how long would you
want this to go on, Doctor?
- Two weeks.
- Two weeks?
Wouldn't that get a little
monotonous, just Akron, cold beer
and "poor, poor thing"
for two weeks?
No!
It would be wonderful.
Well, I...
I can't help feeling, Doctor,
that you're making a mistake
not allowing the woman to talk.
If she'd been around at all,
she might've picked up some
very interesting news items.
And I'm sure you're
making a mistake
about all that beer
and no whiskey,
but it's your two weeks.
Mr. Dowd, could he...
Would he do this for me?
He could and might.
I've never heard Harvey
say a word against Akron.
By the way, Doctor,
where is Harvey?
Don't you know?
The last time I saw him,
he was with you.
He's probably waiting
for me down at Charlie's.
Yes, that's it.
He's down at Charlie's.
Ah, well, in that case, I think I'll
go down and join him for a nightcap.
Fortunately, Charlie's
stays open rather late.
Excuse me, Doctor.
I want to say goodbye
to some of my friends
before I leave.
Mr. Dowd, none of those
people are your friends.
But I want you to know
that I am your friend.
Well, thank you, Doctor.
And I'm yours.
They underestimate you,
as I did.
This sister of yours is at the
bottom of a conspiracy against you.
She's trying to persuade
me to lock you up.
Today she had commitment
papers drawn up.
She has your power of attorney
and the key to your safety box.
And she brought you here!
My sister did all that
in one afternoon?
That Veta certainly is
a whirlwind, isn't she?
Good heavens, man! Haven't
you any righteous indignation?
Oh, Doctor, I...
Years ago, my mother used
to say to me, she'd say,
"In this world,
Elwood, you must be..."
She always called me Elwood.
"In this world, Elwood,
you must be oh, so smart
"or oh, so pleasant."
For years, I was smart.
I recommend pleasant.
And you may quote me.
This is it. Here we are.
Okay, thank you.
Come on, Myrtle.
- I'll come...
- You wait right here, Veta, girl.
I will not wait here.
I'm going in with you.
You're a very high-strung
girl. This may be an ordeal.
Then let Myrtle Mae
stay here, too.
Now, Mother, you know it isn't
right to put Uncle Elwood away
without some blood
relative being present.
Hey, you're not gonna leave
the lady here. I thought...
See, Omar? Even strangers
think I should go in with you.
I wish to see Dr. Chumley.
I'm sorry, sir. He's in
conference. You'll have to wait.
After dragging me out
of bed at this hour?
Tell him Judge
Omar Gaffney's here.
I telephoned you, Judge Gaffney,
right after we picked up
Mr. Dowd. I'm Dr. Sanderson.
Dr. Sanderson, I demand that
this matter be settled right now!
Oh, good, nobody here
but people.
Mother, you promised
to wait in the car.
You forgot your
Uncle Elwood's bathrobe.
Well why are you all standing around?
I thought you'd be committi...
- Oh, how do you do, Doctor?
- Hello, Mrs. Simmons.
...committing Elwood.
He's the one I told you about.
Girl. Doctor,
what's your opinion?
- How are you feeling, Mrs. Simmons?
- Better, thank you.
In my opinion, Elwood P. Dowd
is suffering from a
third-degree hallucination.
And I recommend
formula number 9-7-7.
Now that's a powerful serum which
will shock him back to reality.
Nothing will do that.
Lock him up.
If this shock formula brings
people back to reality,
that's where we want Elwood.
Yes. If he won't see the
rabbit anymore, give it to him.
Then when Harvey comes to
the door, I'll deal with him.
Mother, won't you please stop talking
about Harvey as if
there were such a thing?
Myrtle Mae, you have a lot to learn,
and I hope you never learn it.
Oh, Mother... Marvin!
Myrtle Mae, baby!
Myrtle Mae, you come back here.
The idea of that terrible man...
Let's get on with this, Doctor.
I'm sorry, but you'll have to
take that up with Dr. Chumley.
Then why waste my time?
Young lady, will you
kindly inform Dr. Chumley
of my presence or must I do it?
I'll attend
to it immediately, sir.
Oh, Miss Kelly.
Isn't Dr. Chumley there?
How nice to see you.
Where is he? Where's
the doctor? What'd you...
Are you all right, Doctor?
Yes, thanks.
I'm quite all right.
Well, Veta and Myrtle Mae!
What a delightful surprise.
Good evening, Elwood.
I brought your bathrobe.
Oh. Well, thank you, Veta.
Dr. Chumley, are we gonna
settle this matter or are we not?
I... I've turned this
case over to Dr. Sanderson.
Oh, no. You forget I don't
work here anymore, Dr. Chumley.
Dr. Sanderson, please disregard
what I said this afternoon.
I... I want you
to head my staff.
I think you're
a very capable young man.
Oh, Lyman, did you hear that?
Now, if you'll excuse me, I...
I have some work to do.
Well, I think this calls
for a celebration.
Why don't we all go down to
Charlie's Place and have a drink?
You're not going
anywhere, Elwood.
You're staying right here.
Yes, Uncle Elwood.
Stay here, son.
Uh-huh. I plan to leave,
you want me to stay.
An element of conflict in any
discussion is a very good thing.
Shows everybody's taking
part and nobody is left out.
I like that.
Ah, Miss Kelly.
Miss Kelly, you know,
when you wear my flower,
you make it beautiful.
"A diviner grace has never
brightened this enchanting face."
Ovid's Fifth Elegy. Ovid's
always been my favourite poet.
My dear, you'll never look lovelier.
I'll never be happier,
Mr. Dowd. I know it.
Hey, this rabbit gag
must be a good one.
Mr. Dowd,
I have a formula, 9-7-7,
that will be good for
you. Will you take it?
- 9-7-7?
- Yes. It's a serum.
You won't see
this rabbit anymore.
But you will see your
responsibilities and your duties.
Uh-huh.
Well, Doctor,
if you thought of this,
I'm sure it must be
a very fine thing.
And if I happen
to run into anybody
who needs it, I'd be
glad to recommend it.
But as for myself, I don't
think I'd care for it.
You hear that, Judge?
You hear that, Doctor?
That's what we have
to put up with.
Veta, do you want me
to take this?
Oh, Elwood,
I'm only thinking of you.
You're my brother and
I've known you for years.
I'd do anything for you.
Harvey wouldn't do anything for
you. He's making a fool of you.
Oh, Elwood, don't be a fool.
I won't.
Why, you could
amount to something.
You could be sitting on the
Western Slope Water Board right now,
if you'd only go over
and ask them.
Veta, if that's what you want,
Harvey and I'll go over
there tomorrow and ask them.
Tomorrow! I wish there might
never be another tomorrow!
Not if Myrtle Mae and I have to
go on living with that rabbit!
Our friends never come
to see us anymore.
We have no social life whatever!
We've no life at all. We're
both perfectly miserable.
- Veta...
- But perhaps you don't care.
All right, now, Veta.
I...
I've always felt that Veta should
have everything she wants, but...
Veta, are you sure?
Yes.
I'll take it. Where do I go, Doctor?
In my office, Mr. Dowd.
This will only take a few
minutes. Why don't you wait?
Veta, you tell Dr.
Chumley to say goodbye
to the old fellow
for me, will you?
Dr. Sanderson, couldn't we...
Yes, Kelly?
Nothing.
I'll need you to give
me a hand, Miss Kelly.
- Right in here.
- After you.
No. Oh, no, after you, Doc.
- Miss Kelly.
- Please.
- No, after you. Here we go.
- All right.
Dr. Sanderson said
it wouldn't take long.
Sit down, girl.
Thank you, Judge.
He said it wouldn't take long.
Relax, girl. Take it easy.
Thank you. I'll try to.
Oh. There you are.
Lady jumped out of my cab
and left without paying me.
She didn't say anything, and a
fellow gets nervous after a while.
Well, there's no cause for
concern, man. How much is it?
All the way out here
from town? 2.75.
Why, I must've
forgotten my wallet.
I was dragged out of bed
in such a hurry,
it's a wonder I didn't forget my pants.
Beg your pardon, Veta.
- Would you take a check?
- We don't take checks.
Yeah, I know, but...
Would you mind, Veta?
Oh. Of course. Yes, I...
I could've sworn
I brought my coin purse.
Where is it? Oh, the idea!
Well, I never!
Oh, I know. I'll get it
for you from my brother.
But I can't go in
to him just now.
He's in there
getting an injection.
It won't take long.
You'll have to wait.
You're gonna get my money from
your brother who's in there
getting some of that stuff
they shoot out here?
Yes. It'll only
take a few minutes.
Lady, I want my money now.
I told you, it'll only
take a few minutes.
We want you to
drive us back to town.
And I told you
I want my money now
or I'm nosing
the cab back to town
and you can wait for the bus.
Well, of all the pigheaded,
stubborn things!
What's the matter with you?
Nothing that 2.75 won't fix.
You heard me.
Take it or leave it.
I never heard of anything so
unreasonable in all my life.
Would you please let my brother
step out here just a moment?
This cab driver won't wait. Oh, Elwood.
Yeah. I'll be right back.
Elwood, I came off
without my coin purse.
Would you please
give this man $2.75?
But don't give him any
more. He's been very rude.
Howdy do. Dowd's my name, Elwood P.
Mine's Lofgren, E.J.
Glad to know you, Mr. Lofgren.
This is my sister Mrs. Simmons,
and my very good friend
Judge Gaffney back there.
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.
Have you lived around
here long, Mr. Lofgren?
- All my life.
- Nice.
- Enjoy your work?
- It's okay.
I've been driving for
Apex Cabs for 15 years.
My brother Joe's been driving
for the Brown Cabs for near 12.
Is that so? You drive for Apex
and your brother Joe for Brown.
That's very interesting,
isn't it, Veta?
Yes.
Mr. Lofgren, let me
give you one of my cards.
Now, my sister and
my charming young niece
live at that address with me.
Wouldn't you and your
brother like to come
and have dinner
with us sometime?
Sure, be glad to.
When? When would you be glad to?
Well, I couldn't come
any night but tomorrow.
I'm on duty all the rest of the week.
Well, tomorrow would be perfect.
We'll be expecting you and
delighted to see you. Won't we, Veta?
Oh, Elwood, I'm sure this
man has friends of his own.
You can't have too many friends.
Don't keep the doctor
waiting, dear. It's rude.
There you are. Keep the change.
I'm glad to have met you, Mr. Lofgren.
I'll expect you and your
brother tomorrow night.
Now, you'll have
to excuse me. I...
A sweet guy.
Certainly.
You could just as
well have waited.
Oh, no.
Listen, lady, I've been
driving this route for 15 years.
I've brought them out
here to get that stuff,
and I've drove them home
after they had it.
It changes them.
Well, I certainly hope so.
You ain't kidding.
On the way out here,
they sit back and enjoy
the ride, they talk to me.
Sometimes we stop
and watch the sunsets
and look at the birds flying.
Sometimes we stop and watch the
birds when there ain't no birds,
and look at the sunsets
when it's raining.
We have a swell time. And
I always get a big tip.
But afterwards, oh-oh.
"Afterwards, oh-oh"? What do
you mean, "Afterwards, oh-oh"?
They crab, crab, crab.
They yell at me,
"Watch the lights! Watch the
breaks! Watch the intersections!"
They scream at me to hurry. They
got no faith in me and my buggy.
Yet, it's the same cab,
same driver,
and we're going back
over the very same road.
It's no fun. And no tips.
My brother would've tipped
you anyway. He's very generous.
He always has been.
Not after this he won't be.
After this, he'll be a
perfectly normal human being.
And you know what
stinkers they are.
Glad I met ya. I'll wait.
Oh, no! No! Elwood, come out!
Come out! Don't give it to him!
Stop it! Stop it!
Elwood, come out!
Don't do that, girl. Dr.
Sanderson's giving the injection.
I don't want him to have it.
I don't like people like that.
I don't want my brother
to be like that. Elwood!
You haven't given him the
injection already, have you?
No, but we're all ready,
Mrs. Simmons.
Oh, Elwood!
Veta?
What's the trouble?
What's the matter?
What's going on?
What's wrong? She wants
to stop the injection.
She does? All right. Come on, you...
You take your hands off me!
Don't you touch me,
you white slaver, you!
Marvin, please!
All right, honey.
Anything you say.
You don't know what you want.
You didn't want
that rabbit either.
And what's wrong with Harvey?
If Elwood and Myrtle Mae and I
want to live with Harvey,
what is it to you?
You don't even have to
come around. It's our house.
- Elwood! Elwood!
- Veta, that's all right.
Veta's all tired out.
She's done a lot today.
Have it your own way, but I'm
gonna take that cab back to town.
And I'm not giving up
another night's sleep again
no matter how big the animal is!
Elwood, let us go, too. I hate this
place. I wish I'd never seen it.
All right, Veta. Just wait
till I get my hat and coat.
Why... Why, look at that!
It's my coin purse.
It must've been
in there all the time.
I could've paid
that cab driver myself.
Harvey!
Thank you, Doctor.
Oh! Myrtle Mae and that man!
They make a beautiful
couple, don't they?
Mr. Wilson has such
a dynamic personality.
That man...
Myrtle Mae...
Mr. Wilson, may we have
the pleasure of your company
tomorrow night for dinner?
We're having a few
friends in. Very informal.
Certainly, Mr. Dowd.
I'd be glad to.
Thank you. A very nice couple.
And you make a very
beautiful couple, too.
Well, I must find Harvey.
Well, goodbye, Mrs. Simmons.
I'll see you tomorrow night.
Yes. Goodbye, Mr. Wilson.
Myrtle Mae!
Come, Myrtle Mae.
Now, please try to forget all
about that dreadful Mr. Wilson.
Oh, well there you are!
I've been looking
all over for you.
Oh. Wasn't it cold out here?
Mmm?
I don't mind if I do. That'd
warm us up, wouldn't it?
No, Charlie's would be
fine. Yeah, just fine.
Here.
Oh, Mr. Dowd.
Mr. Dowd, don't take him
away. Let him stay with me.
Doctor, whatever he wants to do
is perfectly all right with me.
He knows that. That's up to you.
Would you like to
stay with the doctor?
Mmm?
No, I don't mind.
Have you ever been to Akron?
Hmm?
Akron.
Now, where is Elwood? Elwood,
we've been waiting for you.
I'm sorry, Veta.
We've lost the car.
The judge took it.
We'll have to go down to the
corner and wait for a bus.
Hurry up, dear.
Good night, Mr. Shimelplatzer.
Good night.
Was anything the matter?
No, I thought you decided
to stay with Dr. Chumley.
You... Huh?
You...
Well, thank you, Harvey.
I prefer you, too.
