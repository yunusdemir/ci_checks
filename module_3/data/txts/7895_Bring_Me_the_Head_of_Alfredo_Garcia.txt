Miss Theresa. You father
is waiting for you.
I know.
- Right now, my sweet.
- I don't want to go.
Poor thing.
Your father
wants you immediately.
Who is the father?
Who is the father?
Who is the father?
No!
Alfredo Garcia!
Poor, poor girl.
He was like a son to me.
Please, I'll pay a million to whoever
brings me the head of Alfredo Garcia.
Bring me the head
of Alfredo Garcia.
Bring it to me!
- Do you care for a drink, sir?
- Uh, later.
Excuse me.
- Welcome to Camino Real, sir.
- Thank you.
Enjoy your stay.
OK, Mirador first, and then
La Muñeca, La Collendrina, El Toro.

Another tequila.
<i>- Buenas noches.
- Buenas noches.</i>
We are looking for an old buddy of ours.
A <i>compadre</i> named Alfredo Garcia.
Does anyone here know him, <i>por favor</i>?
<i>Señor?</i>
<i>Señora?</i>
You're sure, huh?
How about you?
No, <i>señor.</i>
First drink's on the house,
gentlemen.
What do you like to hear?
Take care of those gentlemen,
Paulo.
Your wish, gentlemen?
- Tequila.
- Uh, Tequila and a beer back.
<i>Buenas noches.</i>
Hello, handsome.
Something for the ladies?
<i>Burro</i> piss?
Come on,
what do you wanna hear?
Who knows?
What would you like?
How about, uh,
"I Remember April"?
"I Remember April."
- Yeah.
- Excuse me.
- What's that?
- Oh, it's just an old song.
Now, how about
buying you a drink?
Great!
Gimme a double Jack Daniels on the rocks.
We've got a live one here.
Take me to your leader.
Well, cheers, money and love.
How do you like that beer?
You know they brought, uh,
German Bürgermeisters over here
back in about 1800 and something.
Who knows?
- Long time ago.
- Do you want to be with me?
Some of the best beer in the world
comes from Mexico.
How good are you?
How you guys like baseball?
Take her away.
I'm beginning to like basketball lately,
it's a faster game, you know what I mean?
How about that Bill Russel
on the Celtics, 1969?
Now, there was a ball player.
You've worked around here
quite a while, huh?
Yeah, about six years.
Started up in the Black Cat in T.J.
Now that was a nice place.
Classy place,
classy people came in there.
One night Paulette Goddard came in
and asked me if I knew...
You know a lot of studs
around here?
Who you looking for?
Well, like I said, an old buddy of ours,
a very close chum.
We'd like to meet up
with him again.
He's quite a ladies' man.
His name is Alfredo Garcia.
Maybe you can help us
find him.
He's about thirty.
Sometimes he calls himself Al Garcia.
He speaks English, Spanish
and a little French.
Quite a stud, huh?
Son of a bitch...
but you got me.
I do recognise the name.
You know the name Garcia?
Sure, it's like Jones or Smith.
We're at
the Hotel Camino Real
if you come up with anything,
we'd be glad to see you.
Bring that with you.
Well, don't worry,
if he's alive, I'll find him.
Oh, alive isn't our problem.
Well, uh, how about dead or alive?
How about that?
Dead, just dead.
What would you like to hear?
"Guantanamera."
I didn't catch your name,
mister.
Dobbs. Fred C. Dobbs.
Paulo!
What's up?
When was the last time
Al Garcia was around here?
One week.
At the most.
You know anybody around here
that might know where he is?
Elita.
He has stayed with her.
Elita.
No shit?
I'll be damned.
Hello, Bennie.
Smiley. Long way from Durango,
aren't you, pard?
Gee...
Well, what do you say?
Look at that!
Things have changed.
Hey, where is my shoe?
Get up.
Excuse me, please.
What are you doing here
so early?
It's later than you think, <i>chula.</i>
How'd you like a black eye?
What have you
been drinking?
You're a lying, cheating,
no-good two-bit bitch.
How's your...
how's your cold?
What cold?
The one you had last week
when I couldn't see you for three days.
What's the matter?
What's the matter, Bennie?
Ah, <i>buenas noches,</i>
Benjamino.
Yeah, well, give me a double bourbon
with a champagne back
and none of your chicano bullshit.
Now shove off.
Three days and three nights.
- Alfredo Garcia?
<i>- Sí</i>, Alfredo.
I feel very bad.
- Give me a chance. I'll explain it to you, OK?
- Do it.
Well, he was here
and we spent some time together.
We were saying goodbye...
for ever.
It took a little time.
If I ever get my hands on him,
I'm gonna kill him.
I'm afraid it's too late.
When he left here,
he was very drunk.
And near Saltillo,
his car refused the road
and the rocks killed him.
Jesus Christ.
Amen.
<i>Buenas noches, amiga.</i>
- Do you have to go?
- See you later.
<i>Perdón.</i>
Come in.
Glasses.
Give me your number.
Eleven. Lucky.
I bet you guys didn't expect
to see me so soon, huh?
You're wasting our time.
What have you got?
You don't mess around, do you?
Right down to business.
It's really very simple.
If you give us the information we want,
as to where we can find Alfredo Garcia,
we'll give you 1,000 dollars.
If your information is wrong,
you too are wrong.
Dead wrong.
Well, you see,
he's, uh, a friend of a friend.
And I'd like to know
what you want him for.
Well, that's not true.
I mean, I gotta tell somebody
something right?
You're interested in money, aren't you?
Money you can spend.
Yes, sir. Indirectly.
I mean, there are other things.
Like I'd like to stay alive.
A loser.
Nobody loses all the time.
I don't like the money.
How much is it worth to you?
- We can go 5,000.
- 10,000.
- I go all the way or I pass.
- I gather by that you mean dead?
That's right.
That's what I got in mind.
Well, my friend,
one must do what one must do.
All we require from you
is physical proof that Garcia is dead.
What kind of physical proof?
We're well aware of the problem,
and we're prepared to settle for his head.
Yeah, but the...
head must match the picture.
It's a deal.
But I want 5,000 dollars in advance.
I'll need some operating cash, right?
- You don't have to kill him with kindness.
- Give him 200 dollars.
Well...
Well, thank you, gentlemen.
- You've got four days.
- And Bennie...
After that,
we come to find you.
<i>No, gracias, señora.</i>
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking your clothes off.
Make love.
Go away. Goddammit!
Change the sheets, darling.
I got another job. You hear me?
Get up!
Come on, honey.
Let's get on the road.
- Up and at 'em!
- Don't!
- Hey, <i>ahorita!</i>
- That hurts, Bennie. Knock it off.
Hey, I saw those guys
that were looking for Alfredo yesterday.
- Did you tell them he was dead?
- No.
- Why not?
- In this house, we know nothing.
I wanna see his grave.
Tell me...
Did he give you good head?
You dirty little...
Dirty mind!
You son of a gun!
No, Bennie...
- Now...
- Now.
You pack a lunch.
No, you pack. You pack good,
'cause we're going on a picnic.
- Oh, no...
- I'm gonna find a golden fleece, baby.
What is all this, Bennie?
- Just get up.
- Oh, OK.
- Get up! Get up, come on.
- I am up!
- Up, up!
- Can't you see?
- Get up.
- Oh, no!
Oh, don't play with my hangover.
Please, Bennie.
Whoever wants ice cream,
come and get it. Run!
Do you want one?
Oh, yes.
The paper is in the...
Goodbye. Hope everything goes well.
Have a nice trip.
Let me pass.
I have a heavy load.
Stop here for your ice cream.
Give me a little kiss, coyote.
God!
Jesus Christ!
It doesn't matter, baby.
As long as I'm with you,
I don't give a damn.
Chalo! Enough already. Chalo.
Have pity, Chalo.
It's enough.
- Hungry, baby?
- A little. But not for <i>elotes.</i>
- Meat in the pot, honey.
- Oh.
Bravo, bravo!
- Hell, I wasn't trying to hit 'em, you know.
- I know you weren't.
I used to shoot a lot of pistols
when I was in the army.
You're a nice <i>gringo.</i>
You didn't have a thing to do
in the army anyway.
Oh, you'd be surprised, honey.
Shit...
- Don't bug me about it.
- You're a stupid son of a bitch.
Let's go.
Then we'll go to Cozumel,
after that Aldea Mineras.
- You ever been there?
- No.
I haven't either.
Hell, I've never been any place
I wanna go back to, that's for damn sure.
I was once at a place
I'd like to see again.
Yeah?
<i>Absolutamente</i>, baby, you name it.
It's called Guanajuato.
With a "G". Guanajuato.
Guanajuato.
Yes. That's very good.
It's a beautiful
old Spanish town.
It's, uh, 16th century, or...
Let me see, 16... 17th century.
I don't know.
I get mixed up with the centuries.
Yes, because, they start...
You know...
Oh, well, never mind.
You know, and they have tunnels built
all over the town.
And on top of the tunnels,
there's the houses.
You can see the little windows,
you know, hanging out.
- Yeah.
- Beautiful. You'll like it there.
I was there once with a...
Yeah, with who?
I forgot.
Can we go there?
Sometime?
No.
I wanna go someplace new.
Can we find a new place?
With Alfredo's help,
we can do anything, honey.
We're not doing bad.
I'll go on doing commercials,
and pretty soon you can buy your place.
Bullshit, baby, that's not my place.
Just a pit stop for a bunch of tourists.
- This time, I'm moving up.
<i>- Mico</i>, we're moving up.
And most important, at last to me is,
we're together, Bennie.
We're together.
And we marry someday.
In a church.
Yeah, we'll marry someday
in a church.
Bullshit, Bennie!
- Naw, I mean it this time.
- When?
When?
Sunday.
Why so?
Why?
Because I figure AI's worth
about 10,000 bucks.
I don't understand.
Well...
Your <i>primero amor</i>, my darling,
has made a mistake.
And some people
want him dead.
Al? You're kidding.
No, I'm not kidding.
And we're gonna get
some proof.
Jesus...
Well, I...
Not with me, huh?
You don't want me to be
part of that, do you?
You are a part of it.
For you or for me.
Or do it for Al.
He wants you to be happy,
doesn't he?
Didn't he always want you
to be happy?
Yes, he wanted me happy,
but...
Well, it's good knowing
what you want, Bennie.
But it so happens
I don't know what I want.
You see, uh...
we women have so many ways.
I'm just shocked.
<i>Salud</i> Alfredo.
<i>Salud</i> Alfredo, right?
I guess he'd want me
to be happy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Bennie?
Yeah?
Have you really thought about
marrying me?
I mean... seriously?
Have you?
Yes, I have.
How come
you never asked me?
I don't know,
but I do now.
Ask me, then.
Ask me.
Will you marry me?
Coyote! Coyote...!
Let's not sleep
in the city tonight.
I brought some blankets and food.
Everything we need.
I'll fix a dinner for you,
and we can sleep under the stars.
I wanna make you
so happy tonight.
My life.
- We buttin' in?
- Yeah, a little bit.
Well, we'll leave
if you want us to.
That fire looks mighty good,
though.
Hey, I think I got a cold
from that chick last week.
She was hacking like
a goddamn coal miner.
You play that thing?
Not much. My wife does.
No kidding?
Hey, you know an old song
called "Cielito lindo"?
<i>- Sí.</i>
- How about that?
Hey, could she play it?
<i>Por favor.</i>
♪ That guitar is like a woman
♪ Just like a woman
♪ You'd be good
if you can get her
- ♪ She'd tremble when you touch her ♪
- OK, man, knock it off.
♪ But she just
keeps on getting better ♪
Look here what I got.
You wanna borrow it?
Yeah.
I think I'll just borrow yours.
It's all right, Bennie.
You guys
are definitely on my shit list.
He's a rotten sport,
your old man.
Let's get out of here.
Come on.
I'm gonna kill you one day,
you <i>gringo</i> son of a bitch!
Oh, no, you won't, Bennie.
I've been here before,
and you don't know the way.
What the hell?
She can handle it
a lot better than I can.
She sure can.

Goddammit!
Son of a bitch! Damn!
Hey.
You're dead!
Come on,
let's get out of here.
Come on.
I don't know what to say.
Damn it to hell,
I don't know what to say.
You did all right.
- I will tell everything to the police.
- No chance.
You're gonna take me to find Alfredo.
And that's our ticket outta here.
Jesus, I don't know
how you can get money from a dead body.
I mean, I don't believe that people
and what they say.
I'll take 'em proof.
His head.
- His head?
- For proof!
But it's a crime, Bennie!
You're mad!
He's dead! Shut up!
But you want me
to desecrate a grave!
Don't give me that crap!
There's nothing sacred
about a hole in the ground.
Or a man that's in it.
Or you, or me.
Listen!
The church cuts off
the feet, fingers...
any other goddamn thing
from the saints, don't they?
Well, what the Hell?
Now Alfredo's our saint.
He's a saint of our money.
And I'm gonna borrow a piece of him.
All right...
I'll take you to him,
and then I'm gonna go, you know.
'Cause I figure everything
is gonna be over with us.
I don't want any more of that.
Oh, please.
Benjamino, please.
Let's put it together.
Just... make it round and let's go back
and forget about the whole thing.
We'll never
talk about it again.
Jesus, just being together is...
is enough!
No, it's not, baby.
It takes pan,
bread... <i>dinero.</i>
We need a room for the night,
double bed.
I'm sorry, sir,
but this hotel does not allow...
Now, listen...
Mr. and Mrs. Benjamin
from Mexico City.
And we're very, very tired.
And you pluck out one of those keys
while I sign the register.
Understand?
Understand?
Best room in the house,
please.
I love you.
Where are we?
Huixtla. We can ask for him
at a place they make furniture.
That's it. There.
<i>- Buenos tardes.
- Buenos tardes.</i>
What'd he say?
No luck.
Yeah?
No luck at all.
I guess we came all the way
for nothing, huh?
Let me tell you something,
baby.
I could've died
in Mexico City or T.J.
and never known
what the hell it was all about.
But I got a chance, a ticket,
and we're not gonna miss it!
Now get in there!
Sit down!
And take me to him!
There ain't no more chances.
Get in!
What did she say?
I think she'd like us to go.
Well, you tell her
that we've come a long way
to pay our respects to this man,
and we're very tired.
Tell her we wanna get
a room for the night.
We'll leave in the morning.
A bottle of brandy
and a room for tonight, please.
30 pesos.
<i>Gracias.</i>
Listen, honey.
You oughta be drunk
in Fresno, California.
This place is a palace.
Listen.
I promise I'll put the grave back
just the way I found it.
Nobody's gonna miss him
anyhow.
Alfredo's been trying
to beat this rap all his life.
So have I, so have you.
He loved you,
but I love you now.
Think he'd give a damn
if his head could buy you
what you've always
been looking for?
A way out.
There's a church here.
Could we go there?
Yeah.
Later.
I got to go.
I'm going with you.
No.
Hey, hey...
Oh, God. Hey...
Hey, we're alive.
Hey...
Hey, come on. Hey!
Hey. Hey! Hey!
Hey...
It's gone.
Hey, honey, come on, we gotta...
we gotta get outta here.
The head's gone.
We better... we gotta get outta here.
In a fuckin' hurry.
Come on you, you gotta help me.
Sit up.
We gotta get out of this...
this... this place.
We gotta get...
out of here.
Maybe you wanna...
you wanna stay here?
You wanna stay?
Then stay here!
In a grave with him?
Goddammit!
Stay with him!
Go on, and stay with him! Shit!
Turn over! Goddammit!
Turn over and be in the right place!
Oh, shit...
Oh, shit!
You son of a bitches!
Tell me...
have any <i>gringos</i> been here
asking about Alfredo Garcia? Huh?
Ah, yes, two men arrived.
What?
In a green station wagon.
They didn't ask anything.
Get outta here!
Get out! Goddammit!
Get outta here... you son of a bitch
or I'll kill you right there!
Get! Goddamn move,
when I say move, you motherfucker!
Look at me
with your goddamn fucking eyes.
Come out of the dark on me,
you bastards!
I'm gonna nail you,
somewhere I'm gonna nail you.
You're up there.
You're up there, you son of...
I'm gonna find you.
Damn your eyes!
'God, let me see
that big station wagon.'
You and all the goddamn drinking.
I do all the fucking work!
Why?
Because it feels
so goddamn good.
Get outta there, come on.
Sorry, Al.
Sorry!
What's so special
about you anyway, huh?
Get over there.
You got something...
valuable inside, huh?
They want to cut that out.
Cough it up, baby.
You got jewels in your ears?
Diamonds up your nose?
You son of a bitch!
It wasn't worth it, baby.
It wasn't worth her.
And I'll be dammed if she's not keeping
the best part of you company.
You low-life bastard.
There's nothing here.
Just a bottle.
Let's go.
Three days
and three nights, huh?
I hope you enjoyed her.
I did.
Hell, it wasn't your fault.
I know that.
But we're gonna find out.
You and me.
Good morning, <i>señor.</i>
I'm at your service.
Scrambled eggs,
<i>cerveza muy frío, por favor.</i>
Wash your car, sir?
It's very dirty.
Go ahead.
- Where is my beer, <i>señora</i>? Hurry, please.
- I'm coming, <i>señor.</i>
<i>Señor</i>, there are a lot of flies
in your car.
Many flies.
<i>Moscas?</i>
Oh, flies.
- You got any <i>hielo</i>?
- Ice?
Yes, yes,
I have ice, <i>señor.</i>
Go for the ice!
No!
No.
Me.
- Where is it, <i>señora</i>?
- Over here.
What do you
have in the sack, sir?
A cat. Dead cat.
Used to belong
to a friend of mine.
'Boy, you're a nice <i>gringo,</i>
Bennie.
'What about a <i>corrido</i>
for my beautiful man?
Bullshit.
Son of a bitch...
Have a drink, Al.
I know about graves.
What's done is done, right?
It's <i>finito.</i>
I've killed people.
And worse, a lot worse.
But I'm gonna keep him.
I'm not giving him back.
I didn't do it!
But I would have.
That's just the way it goes.
Ask him
if he did this for the money.
You do this for <i>dinero</i>?
You do this for money, huh?
No.
<i>Sí.</i>
Take it.
It's all I got.
<i>Por favor.</i>
Goddamn you!
I'm gonna finish this
with him!
- Alfredo, <i>señor</i>, give it to me.
- I give you nothing.
<i>- Buenos días.
- Buenos días, señor.</i>
<i>Perdóname.
Usted habla inglés?</i>
Yeah, a couple of us do.
Ah, good. I see you got
a little trouble here, huh?
We got some trouble, too.
Looks like we're kinda lost.
- Everything OK?
- Yeah.
Well, look, uh, you see we left here,
and we're trying to get to there.
Now, where's the cut-off?
It's right here.
But you're gonna have to take it.
Oh, oh, we're gonna have to take it.
I see. I see.
Well, thank you very much.
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>
Well, we found it.
It's right here.
We're gonna have
to make our move now.
- You OK, Bennie?
- Yeah.
Who the hell are they?
Just family.
That's him.
You sure have
a nose for shit.
Yeah, I could smell it at 100 miles.
Sometimes closer.
Johnny?
Johnny?
Do I get paid?
Yeah, you get paid.
Hey, Johnny.
A friend of ours
used to take a shower in there.
You know that?
You don't know that.
How you like that, huh?
That cools your hot bag.
Huh?
Well, he's taking a shower now,
you know?
Shit...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Son of a bitch...
Yeah
Yeah.
- Hello, uh...
- Bennie.
Bennie. Hello, Bennie.
I thought
you would be back soon.
- I guess that's it, huh?
- Yeah.
It's all here.
You can, uh, you can count it
if you want to.
- It's all there.
- Hell of a job, Bennie.
- Come, I'll show you.
- Just put it on the table.
Here, Bennie, here it is.
- Don't you wanna check it?
- Oh, we'll check it.
But you're too smart
to stiff us.
How much is it worth?
How much is it really worth?
Ten grand is all you get,
bartender.
What do you want it for?
Not you guys, you don't want it.
- What the hell would you want with that?
- No questions, Bennie.
The 10,000 answers it all.
Put it on the table
and we'll check it and then <i>adios.</i>
Go and have yourself a party or two.
You deserve it.
No.
Come on, bartender.
You deaf?
You're either that
or you're a bigger shmuck than you look like.
I'd like to keep
the basket, OK?
Keep it.
Thanks.
You see, this belonged
to a very... special lady.
Once upon a time...
she filled it up with food...
and we went on a picnic.
We turned off a dirt road,
we ate the food she prepared
with her hands.
Very special hands.
And that's why
I'd like to know
why you don't...
check it...
and tell me what the head
of Alfredo Garcia is worth!
And to who! <i>Comprendo</i>?
<i>Comprendo!</i>
This is the man who'll pay...
Right, Al.
Let's go.
There's a guardhouse coming up.
Somebody's waiting for us.
Take it easy, Al.
What are you doing here?
I'm here to see <i>El Jefe.</i>
What for?
Just tell him
Alfredo Garcia is here.
The ceremony is over.
I've got something here you want.
His name is Alfredo.
I don't know what you want him for,
but here he is.
Seseña...
bring me the money.
Welcome.
I was expecting you.
Excuse me for a moment, please.
Won't you join me for a drink?
I'm a very happy man.
I got nothing to celebrate.
Here's the...
merchandise you bought.
And paid for.
Take it and go.
I have everything that I want.
I have my grandson.
So go.
And don't forget to take that
and throw it to the pigs.
No.
16 people are dead
because of...
him...
and you...
and... and me.
And one of 'em was
a damn good friend of mine!
No!
No!
No.
First time I saw him,
he was dead.
Kill him!
Come with me.
Come on, Al,
we're going home.
- What's happened inside?
- My dad is dying. Help him!
Listen. Take this.
You take care of the boy,
and I'll take care of the father.
