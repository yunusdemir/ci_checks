Another day gone.
Soon it will be dark.
The night will smell
of trees and earth.
That's when the images return...
Images of my former life,
suddenly arising,
alljumbled...
Makes me feel uneasy.
I wasn't happy in a cage
with others of my breed.
Even then, my dearest wish
was to live with humans.
to see them, smell them...
and try to understand
the astonishing things
they sometimes do.
I figured I had a lot to learn
from humans.
THE HUMANS
Never put a coin in your mouth...
and don't let dogs lick you...
They use their tongues
for toilet paper.
I mowed 4 lawns, washed 3 cars
inside and out,
made 30 bucks. Great, huh?
Yeah... How late can you stay
tonight?
Tonight's out.
I have a lawn to mow.
Can't it wait?
No, it's for a friend of Dad's.
And it pays...
His wife always slips me
some extra money.
Beat me!
Easy, Princess.
Take it easy.
'Wednesday, the 23rd: Pain"
Charles... It's ready.
Eat slowly.
Sorry I'm late, I was in a meeting.
That you, Marie?
Yes, Dad.
I didn't wait.
Sorry, I had a teachers' meeting.
- A bit more?
- No, thanks.
I entered you in the bridge
tournament on the 17th.
And... can you come
to my lecture?
Aren't you overdoing things?
Bridge tourneys, lectures, meetings,
keeping yourself busy...
Why knock yourself out so?
You can't let yourself go
at our age.
Look at Mrs. Gentilhomme
and her poodle...
2 years ago she was still fine,
came to all our meetings...
Now look at her!
That has nothing to do with it,
André!
Growing old is a matter
of dignity...
You have it or you don't.
Frankly, Françoise Gentilhomme...
What are you thinking about?
Summers when we were kids.
Remember when the tar melted
and we had to hop
across the street?
Tar never melts nowadays.
Because the trees have grown.
The trees...
I never thought of that.
Happy birthday!
Thanks, Florence.
Happy birthday, Mom.
Nowfor your present.
What is it?
His name is Baxter.
Come on, Baxter,
say hello to your mistress.
Not there, you filthy hound!
Not upstairs. Come back here!
At first I didn't know what to do.
The 0ld Lady didn't like me...
I scared her.
I knewthat just from her smell.
Not my clothes...!
Come now,
Mrs. Deville, don't get so upset
over a dog.
He not only tears things,
he sticks his nose in...
I found that...
disgusting!
In what?
In... everything...
My lingerie...
That's harmless!
Harmless... Giving me a dog...
An insult!
Call your daughter
and tell her to take it back.
Florence? Take Baxter back?.
You know howshe is.
It can't hurt to talkto her.
She'll say terrible things to me.
Did I tell you about last Easter?.
It's very becoming.
My hairdo?
Yes... no... I don't know.
MY LIFE WITH THE OLD LADY
Cats and birds don't need
human company.
There's no tie.
Especially birds.
Birds have always amazed me.
Maybe someday I'll kill one.
The only time I'm happy
is when she lets me out
into the garden.
But it's never for long.
She wants me with her.
Stay downstairs!
0r I'll put yourself in the cellar!
Let go of me!
Don't touch me!
I'm uneasy
when people are scared.
So I made an effort
and it worked out OK.
You won't bite?
Can I touch?
You won't bite?
Nice doggy...
It worked out for her,
but not for me.
Did you call your daughter?.
Why should I?
About the dog.
0h, that...
No, I haven't called her.
If it upsets you, I can do it.
No, I'll do it.
Really?. Because I wouldn't mind...
Don't worry.
One diamond!
I could take to Fremont...
the old gardener.
His dog died.
I'll handle myself.
It'd make Fremont happy.
What's wrong with having a dog?
Nothing. I thought...
What if I want a dog?
That bother you?
Certainly not! I thought...
Keep your mind on your cards!
Drives me crazy!
Why're you always butting
into people's lives?
I quit!
Take it easy, Marguerite.
Do I butt into your life?
Talk about your daughter?. No!
I've had it!
Let me alone!
Please... Wait!
You're being silly!
What'd I say?. Wait for me!
A nice basket!
Her hand is dry, she has no smell,
except what she's touched.
Nowshe's always pawing me.
When she does,
she puts on a special voice...
special for me!
I liked it better
when she was scared.
I don't know what she wants.
She gives me no orders!
She asks nothing of me,
except boring things
like staying beside her.
For a while I thought
she wanted to eat me.
It could still happen...
Because now I know
she'll swallow anything!
Delicious!
Then she goes up to bed,
shuts the door and does things
I'm not allowed to see.
So I go to the window
and think of how
the garden smells.
Something happened
in the street today.
People I don't know arrived.
They were young...
and they laughed.
I'm off to the dump.
Charles,
come and say hello.
Your hair's a mess.
Nice shirt.
How do you close this?
Press on it.
Dad'll be late,
so we'll dine early.
Afternoons I lie down
in the bedroom.
I watch the house opposite...
and I think of the Couple.
I try to think of something else,
but I can't.
It's too strong for me.
The other day the Woman...
...went into the garden, barefoot,
and she touched my head.
She smelled of the Tree.
Beneath that smell was...
something even stronger.
that reminded me of...
certain desires...
I've rarely known...
such pleasure.
Later, when everything is quiet,
I'll concentrate hard
and hear thatvoice.
HER voice.
I'll imagine the sound of cloth
against skin
when they undress...
and the odors of their bodies.
After the light goes out,
I'll wait for the sounds they make.
Then the 0ld Lady'll fetch me.
This can't go on!
She must learn it's dangerous
to make a creature unhappy.
Especially if the creature's
stronger than you.
Baxter, come on, big fella!
Hold on. I'll call her.
Don't yell, I hear you. Who is it?
Your mother.
She fell down the stairs.
Baxter saved my life.
I slipped.
If he hadn't been there...
Sure, Mom...
What's that mean?
Nothing, Mom.
Don't be snippy!
I tell you he grabbed my robe.
Here!
Believe me?
Sure I do.
Let's not fight...
For a change...
It's Florence!
On Easter Sunday...
It's always my fault.
I'm sorry, OK?
That hurt?
A little.
Now we'll try these.
I'm tired, Roger.
We're not leaving until
you can use them.
You're holding me too tight.
Rather I let you go?
Where is he?
Not so fast, Roger.
Where is who?
Baxter.
Where is he?
Probably hiding. You scare him.
A good thing, too!
Why?.
It's the only way with dogs.
Without a dominant male to obey,
they're confused.
Then why's he hiding?
He thinks I betrayed him.
What do you mean?
By giving him to you,
I betrayed him.
Is this too tight?
Nowturn around.
Take it easy on the curve.
That's fine.
I hope you don't pamper him.
Pamper him?
Treating him like a human.
No chance.
With that ankle you'd better
sleep here, on the sofa bed.
The dominant male will open it.
Sleep downstairs?
You must be joking!
The 0ld Lady didn't understand
my warning.
She's too weak...
and stupid.
At night she hears nothing...
not the rustle of leaves,
nor the cries...
nor the birds tossing
in their sleep.
She thinks she's safe.
She's wrong.
I've tried to be helpful
and warn her.
But she won't listen.
So when she's asleep,
like that, I go up to the bedroom.
I go to the window.
I look at the house
across the street
and wait for them to make
their noises in the dark.
On April 28, 1945,
we were only 300yards
from the Chancellery
in the Red Army spearhead.
fighting hand to hand in Berlin,
advancing house by house.
The flames at night were
like the end of the world.
When we entered the ruins
of the Chancellery
we found Hitler's bunker below it,
60feet underground of solid steel
and indestructible concrete.
In it were the bodies
of Hitler and Eva Braun.
Have you seen Mrs. Deville?
Not for quite a while.
Since when?
She's canceled her appointments
over the past three weeks.
Why's he prowling around me
like that?
I'm not allowed at the window
to watch the Couple,
or even to go
into the garden anymore.
I don't know
what's wrong with her.
More and more she watches
the blue light.
She talks to the shadows
moving in it.
The place is a mess.
Her smell is stronger now.
I liked it better...
when she smelled of fear.
Then she gets up
and I have to follow her...
0r she ties me up.
Now I know what goes on behind
the door... She leaves it open.
How can she lie in that water,
stroking her body?.
No one's making her do it!
I couldn't stand it!
I'd go crazy.
This is fine... little man.
No more upstairs...
We'll stay down here,
just the 2 of us.
I'm right, aren't I?
Are you there, Marguerite?
It's André!
Don't bark!
Answer me,
why're you mad at me?
Good dog.
Answer me!
That busybody!
Do I butt into
his daughter's affairs?
I don't care who she screws.
Why're you so sure she's sick?.
She won't open the door.
Is that normal?
Is she fed up?
What's that mean?
Let her be. Maybe she's tired,
or needs to be alone.
What if she's sick?.
If she has... I dunno...
Nobody gives a damn!
We can all die and no one cares!
There's been no love here.
Never any love.
I thought I loved Antoine...
not at first...
A year, maybe 2.
After I had my daughter
he disgusted me.
So he took up with others,
even Françoise Gentilhomme.
I'm still in good shape.
Lots of women of 40
would envy my body.
Lookwhat's happened
to Florence...
and she's not 40yet.
Come on, Baxter...
I must throw out the flowers...
straighten the closets...
I'll buy a mop.
"The Little Man"...
Know what "The Little Man" was?
That's what I called his...
what he had between his legs...
"The Little Man".
She's not answering.
I told you: she's there
and won't answer.
We'll have a bath, doggie.
Stay here, Baxter...
Baxter, come back!
Images from the past
have returned.
When the present is unbearable,
you have natural thoughts.
Come, my little man...
Forgive me...
I'll make you something to eat...
a nice snack... eh?...
if you like.
I'll let you out into the garden.
Forgive me?
The hell with it!
Marguerite, are you here?
Stop!
A dog!
A dog?
I tell you there's a dog.
It's the neighbor's.
Some nerve.
Come here, doggie,
don't be afraid.
Hey, there!
Hey, young man...
Come... Mrs...
Mrs. Deville had an accident.
She fell down her stairs...
The dog seems to like you.
Want it?
Sure you don't want it...
as a memento?
I don't like dogs.
Your husband breeds them.
That's why. Want it?
Why not?
THE HAPPY DAYS
The woman is almost
always with me.
She loves to touch me.
On hot afternoons we lie down...
and listen to the insects,
and the birds.
Sometimes I catch a creature
and give it to her,
so she'll get to know me.
Now and then I think
of the 0ld Lady...
I'm hardly mad at her anymore.
Like it?
Terrific!
Want your gift?
Wasn't that it?
That was from Baxter.
And yours?
Maybe it's...
No, it's not there...
Not there, either...
Wait... I think it's here.
You mean you're...?
Let's look. I can't see it.
You have to wait 9 months
to see it.
Really?.
Sure. Are you glad?
And how!
Isn't it a bit too soon for us...?
No! Love me?
Then it's not too soon.
Something's changing.
The Woman's changing.
She's less attentive.
She pats me less.
She smells different.
I seem to smell two people.
You Ok?.
He can really kick!
He's in a hurry to get out.
Feel him.
Put your hand here.
Go on, I won't break.
There... Feel him?
How about here?
Yes.
I'll finish dressing.
Let's put his crib
in the laundry room.
Southern exposure:
he'll get positive vibes.
Love me?
Wait... You mean it?
I thinkthe Woman's sickness
bothers the man, too.
They've stopped doing
some things.
At night, in the big bed
they talk a bit,
then go right to sleep.
What is it?
A pool, with a fountain.
It's been here all long.
We didn't notice it
under all the junk.
I'm not sure I want it.
The Man loves the earth, like me.
He releases smells
from under the grass...
smells of rot,
or even stronger.
I love that!
The woman doesn't love the earth.
Nowthat she's sick she's cautious,
and stays home.
I go from one to the other.
At the 0ld Lady's
I didn't know my function.
Here it's to go from one
to the other. That's good.
It mustn't change.
I've been doublecrossed.
For days I've been shut in.
Without even fresh water.
I'm cold.
The Man came to me
this morning.
He wanted to show me something.
It's so weak...
and mindless.
It was damp,
toothless,
almost hairless.
I thought they were ashamed of it,
that they were apologizing.
But when I looked at them,
they seemed happy.
Putting him in the garage?
Can't he stay in the house?
With the baby?.
Baxter, you won't be jealous,
will you?
Promise?
See? He swore to it.
Surfacing turbines stand by!
Surfacing turbines, all ahead!
Stand by to open hatches! Open!
All clear. End emergency drill.
I had an idea this morning.
It came while I laid in the grass.
I heard the sounds of the earth...
and watched the Creature.
Then it did something new.
It was getting interesting, but...
No, baby!
...the Woman arrived.
Don't go "splash".
Lookwho's here, baby.
Someday she'll growtired
of watching the Creature.
Then I'll push the Creature in
with the fish
and when it's too late
I'll call for help.
You OK?
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Come on, tell me.
Do you think of me
when we're apart?
Of course.
What do you think?.
That I love you.
Love me how?. On the back seat?
Don't you believe I love you?
That's not love.
Love's bigger... It's...
not just when...
It's all the time...
It's... I dunno... something.
Total! Right?
Why resist, André?
Who cares anymore
what you think or feel?
Nobody,
not even your daughter.
Let the young run the world
as they please,
since that's howthey want it.
Let them have their own tragedies
and disappointments.
We've had our share, haven't we?
Let yourself go, André.
Go on...
Put your head on my shoulder.
Let yourself slip away...
It's so nice.
You'll see how nice it is.
Your teacher won't be in today.
Her Dad died.
I'm replacing her. Sit down.
You OK? School alright?
We haven't talked much, lately.
Shall we have a little chat?
Now?.
Sure.
I've got homework.
Let's spend an afternoon together.
Go wherever you say.
How about it?
Sure.
What do you want
for your birthday?.
Dunno yet.
Think about it.
I will.
"Eva Braun and the Alsatian
dog Blondie in Berchtesgaden."
Going to work?.
I'm late already.
To do...?
Contracts as usual.
I want to see your face.
What's the matter?.
Nothing.
Come on, tell me.
It's nothing.
Ok, I'm off.
What's wrong?
In spring you used to phone
in sickto the office
and beg off work.
Why should I phone?
You sick?.
Take care of me...
Fuck me...
Hear that?
Shit!
I called too soon.
I knowthe Man and Woman
didn't see me,
but now everything's changed.
The couple let me down.
They smell of fear,
like the Old Lady.
I wonder if I'll ever find a human
who's like me,
who doesn't feel love... or fear.
We came for...
Yeah, the dog. In the garage.
ljust fed him.
What breed is it?
Bull terrier.
Hard to handle?
No, he's even affectionate,
a good watchdog.
If it was up to me I'd keep him.
It's my wife...
Since the accident...
Sorry about... Please sit down.
The dog's papers are still
in Mrs. Deville's name.
I never changed it.
Her daughter gave him to us.
I must straighten this mess!
He'll be your dog?
It's his birthday present.
I hope you're good to him.
Two things:
feed him well,
and exercise him a lot.
I hate to lose him.
If he hadn't been there, the baby...
Anyway, be good to him.
Who is it, Jean?
Just the people for the dog.
His papers may be in the kitchen.
What's his name?
A HUMAN WH0'S LIKE ME
Come on, Baxter!
Faster!
Heel, Baxter!
Good boy!
Faster!
Jump!
Good, now heel!
The boy isn't like the others.
He's taught me lots of sounds.
When he wakes, I mustn't move
till he makes the calling sound.
Then I feel as if the chain were
tightening on my neck.
It hurts, and I obey.
But there's something else,
which gives me... pleasure...
the greatest pleasure I've ever had.
He commands, I obey.
I have no more unnatural
thoughts. That's good.
Go, boy, attack!
"Speed, Hostility,
Endurance, Jumping..."
This taken?
May I sit here?
On the seat,
not on your schoolbag.
Sometimes the boy surprises me.
Today he went to the Old Lady's
and tried to drag me in.
What's wrong with you?
Go on!
What's wrong with you?
OK, wait here. And don't move!
Cut that out!
That your mutt?
Yes, it's my dog.
Call it.
That dog shouldn't run loose!
- He didn't...
- He was gonna!
I don't want him
jumping my bitch.
Mutts like that
should be outlawed!
In America they're illegal!
Call it off!
I'll look around.
Keep Princess in the truck.
I want her fit
for the hunting season.
He your dad?
What's he after?.
Stuff.
You come here a lot?
Yeah... no... sometimes.
The dog likes it.
What's with you?
He's weird today.
Must be Princess's smell.
What about it?
She's in heat.
Dogs can smell it miles away.
It makes them disobey...
They do what they want.
Know who you're like?
In profile?
Who?
Eva Braun.
- Who's she?
- Hitler's girl.
Very funny.
It's true... Look.
She looks old.
A bad picture.
They say she was beautiful.
- Then why was she with him?
- Love!
They married just before
Berlin fell.
- Then what?
- Suicide.
Cheerful!
If it weren't Hitler, it'd rank
as a great love story.
You really think she's pretty?.
Hold your dog. He's back.
What'd you find?
I walk the dog at night.
Maybe I'll stop by.
Bet you'd love to hump
that spaniel.
It's easy for you!
Dad's home already. Go say hello.
We're having toasted cheese...
Like that?
Anita, Pepe's sister,
has 3 children.
Pepe and Maria like
to play with them.
Maria loves the children.
So does Pepe.
They are very happy.
What's all this mess?
Knock next time!
What'd you do in the bathtub?
An oil change?
I dyed my blue pants black.
Turn down that racket.
What're you doing?
Going out.
Who'll clean up your slime?
Me, later.
Where're you off to? Answer me!
Where're you going?
To walk the dog! OK?
Now you paint your face
for Princess?
Where you slinking off to?
You dress like a slut!
Where'd you get that rig?
The closet.
Don't touch your mother's things!
They're mine, too!
Shut up! Wipe that junk off
and stay home !
I've had it! Stop it!
You've no right!
Says who?
I'm sick of this dump!
And sick of you, you lush!
Don't move! Stay there!
Princess was my mom's dog.
She left her with us
when she moved out.
Her new place must be too small.
Anyway, Dad wouldn't have
let it go.
He's nuts about that dog.
He's nuts, period!
I'm fed up.
I'll go live with Mom someday.
Your folks bug you?
Ever bring a girl here?
Did Eva Braun go in the bunker?.
Toward the end, with Blondie.
That really interest you?
Sure. Who's Blondie?
Their dog. She had 4 puppies
in the bunker.
So Hitler liked dogs?
Mostly puppies.
He always had one to pet.
How'd they do it?
- What?
- Suicide.
Tell me.
With cyanide.
Capsules?
What happened to the dogs?
An officer gave Hitler and Eva
the cyanide.
But Hitler didn't trust it.
He tried it out on Blondie first.
And it worked?
He watched her die,
then had the pups killed.
That's horrible!
When Eva, Blondie and he died,
they were burned, and their ashes
were mixed together.
Shut up, Baxter!
Why not let him out?
What about your dog?
It's my problem.
Stop, what're you doing?
Letting him out.
Scared?
If Dad finds out, he'll kill me!
I should've killed that bitch.
She was disgusting:
her smell, her fur...
it all made me sick.
Yet if she were here now,
I couldn't resist.
I couldn't help doing it again.
I'm ashamed.
Are humans the same way?.
The boy...
...hasn't experienced that.
He's strong.
Now what'll he think of me?
He'll have no more respect for me.
That's bad.
He must understand I'm not weak.
I'm strong!
Stronger than he is.
Get lost!
"Eva Braun in her garden."
Shut up, Baxter!
Baxter, cut it out!
What'd you do today?.
Nowthe boy is really mine.
He pets me warily.
He wouldn't dare challenge me
like that Creature.
Now he knows who I really am,
he respects me. That's good.
Good dog.
May I sit here?
Hi, Eva.
I've got a problem.
What?
Tell Baxter he's a daddy.
You mean with your dog?
Yeah, and Dad's furious.
Do the puppies look like Baxter?.
Too soon to tell.
Want to see them?
I'd love to.
They smell like me.
They're weak and mindless.
The same defects as all
young creatures.
The girl and boy think it's funny
when they fall over.
Of course they can't walk!
When the boy picked them up,
I growled.
I don't know why.
Think Baxter knows they're his?
Yes, but he doesn't care.
How do you know?.
I understand him.
What'll you do with them?
Dunno. Dad wants
to get rid of them.
Says the dog's spoiled for hunting.
Can I keep them?
You'd rather I didn't?
You won't kill them, will you?
Why'd you ask me that?
After what you said about Hitler...
You keep them, then.
Don't trust me?
Sure, keep them. I'm sorry.
Forgive me?
You scared?
- You like it?
- Dunno.
Sure you're not scared?
No, but you are.
Tell me what to do.
I'll do what you want.
Just tell me.
I want you to shut up.
It's a stage. All kids play war.
I don't know.
He comes and locks himself in
without a word.
I don't understand him.
He's just at the awkward age.
Think this hobby is normal?
I don't know.
He has his good points, too.
He's smart, gets good grades.
He's never any trouble.
True, but shouldn't you talk
to him?
About what?
About life... explain things...
If I try and steer him,
he might rebel.
He'll grow out of it.
Think so?
We haven't talked much either
lately.
You've been busy.
I know, but I worked things out.
It's better now.
I've never nagged.
I know... I'm just telling you.
You here?
Collecting bottles.
- I must have $3 worth!
- That's nice.
- How ya doing?
- Fine.
What's that thing there?
See for yourself.
What's in there?
Shit! Your dog!
Charles, put back the ladder!
Attack!
Cut it out! You jerk!
He'll eat me alive!
Attack!
Kill him!
The boy had me all wrong.
When I killed, I had reasons:
if the situation was unbearable.
or I was threatened.
I won't kill for no reason.
I can't trust him now.
He's changing,
but I don't know why.
"Berlin, the last days."
The boy left in the dark
for three days.
Nothing to eat or drink.
My unnatural thoughts
have returned. That's bad!
And I remember the little creatures
that smelled like me.
That's why I left.
His smell mingled with theirs
in the ground.
I knewthen he'd killed them!
This is for gravy...
Where's Baxter?.
In the garage.
No, he's not.
I don't know, calm down.
The medium size...
Where is he?
I don't know.
Where are you going?
When the sun goes down,
the boy will come looking for me.
I'll be waiting for him.
He must die!
Answer me!
Alright.
Playing hide-and-seek, huh?
Very funny!
But I won't lookfor you!
'Cause I know where you are!
Die!
Take that!
And that, dumb-ass!
Another one!
Charles, is that you?
These are for you.
Seen Charles? He's not back yet.
I don't know, he can't be far.
I'm worried.
Then he made the sound...
I'd learned.
Heel, Baxter!
He yelled.
I obeyed.
I couldn't help it.
I was powerless.
Never be obedient.
Stop!
He tried to kill me!
It's all right.
It's all over.
Don't cry.
I'm here.
Daddy's here, it's all over.
Let's go home now.
The pain has ceased, my body
no longer feels the cold air.
Yet I knowthe wind is still strong
because it carries the sounds
and smells of the city.
The sounds that reach me
are hushed.
The first snow will soon fall...
When everyone awakes,
in total silence,
they'll feel uneasy.
They'll think about
the silence of death.
Maybe they'll think about me.
Some might.
The boy surely will.
I hear them laugh and shout,
but soon the street
will fall silent.
That's when I'll stand
at the window,
and observe the lights
in their house.
By concentrating hard,
I'll hear their noises
and imagine things.
What if my parents had
an accident?
If their house suddenly
burned down?
The young couple'd love me.
I'm sure of it.
They see love everywhere.
They saw it in Baxter,
they'll see it in me.
