KRYPTONIAN SHIP VOICE: Welcome.
Analysis reveals ship
operating at 37% efficiency.
Would you like to assume command?
Yes, I would.
Yes, I would. (CLEARS THROAT)
Very well. Let's begin.
The Kryptonian archive contains knowledge
from 100,000 different worlds.
Good. Teach me.

KRYPTONIAN SHIP VOICE: Alexander Luthor,
your security override has been accepted.
Genesis Chamber ready
to analyze genetic sample.
Acknowledging presence
of genetic material.
Analyzing.
I've identified the host as
General Zod of Kandor.
(KNIFE OPENING)
(GROANS)
(BLOOD DRIPPING)
Acknowledging presence
of foreign genetic material.
Analyzing.
You flew too close to the sun.
Now look at you.
Advising. Action forbidden.
It has been decreed
by the Council of Krypton
that none will ever again
give life to a deformity
so hateful to sight and memory.
The desecration without name.
And where is the Council of Krypton?
Destroyed, sir.
Then proceed.
Very well.
Preparing chrysalis
and commencing metamorphosis.
JENNY: "And so we are left to wonder
"if Superman was aware of
the threat and did nothing,
"was he then complicit
in the Capitol tragedy?"
Still no Kent?
JENNY: "His disappearance
raises questions."
No.
"How can he simply have disappeared
"at a time when we, as a nation,
need him more than ever?"
CROWD: (CHANTING ON TV)
Burn him, burn him, burn him.
Burn him, burn him, burn him.
Something, isn't it?
We men of Kansas live on a pancake,
so we come to the mountains.
All downhill from here,
down to the floodplain.
Farm at the bottom of the world.
I remember one season the water came bad.
I couldn't have been 12.
Dad had out the shovels
and we went at it all night.
(CHUCKLES)
We worked till, I think, I fainted.
But we managed to stop the water.
We saved the farm.
Your grandma baked me a cake.
Said I was a hero.
Later that day we found out
we blocked the water all right.
We sent it upstream.
The whole Lang farm washed away.
While I ate my hero cake,
their horses were drowning.
I used to hear them wailing in my sleep.
Did the nightmares ever stop?
Yeah.
When I met your mother.
She gave me faith that
there's good in this world.
She was my world.
I miss you, son.
I miss you too, Dad.
ALFRED: You know you can't win this.
It's suicide.
I'm older now than my father ever was.
This may be the only thing
I do that matters.
Twenty years of fighting criminals
amounts to nothing?
Criminals are like weeds, Alfred.
Pull one up, another grows in its place.
This is about the future of the world.
This is my legacy.
My father sat me down right here.
Told me what Wayne Manor was built on.
Railroads, real estates, and oil.
The first generation made their fortune
trading with the French.
Pelts and skins.
They were hunters.
NANCY GRACE: We gotta wait for more
evidence, but the question still remains,
where is he?
If Superman was not involved,
if he's got nothing to hide,
then why hasn't he been seen
since the day of this tragedy?
You can't...

(MUSIC PLAYING ON SPEAKERS)
Excuse me.
Don't I know...
Plain Lo in the morning. Lola in slacks.
(SIGHS) Lois Lane.
(SNIFFLES)
Mmm. Come see the view.
Um... (SNIFFLES) Mmm-mmm.
Now the secret to the height
is the building material.
It's light metals
which sway a bit in the wind.
Hmm.
And you know something about LexCorp
metals, don't you, Miss Lane?
I've proven what you've done.
Wow, you're feisty.
Unfortunately, that will blow away.
Like sand in the desert.
You're psychotic.
That is a three-syllable word
for any thought too big for little minds.
Hmm. Next category: circles.
Round and round
and round they go to find Superman.
(GRUNTS) Wrong category, boy.
No, no, triangles.
Yes, Euclid's triangle inequality.
The shortest distance between
any two points is a straight path.
And I believe the straightest path
to Superman is a pretty little road...
(SNIFFS) Mmm. Called Lois Lane.
(GASPS)
(SCREAMING)
(GASPING)
You came back.
You came back.
Boy, do we have problems up here!
(CLEARS THROAT)
- (TICKING)
- (STAMMERS)
The problem of... Of evil in the world.
The problem of absolute virtue.
I'll take you in without breaking you.
Which is more than you deserve.
The problem of you
on top of everything else.
You above all.
Because that's what God is.
Horus. Apollo. Jehovah. Kal-El.
Clark Joseph Kent.
See, what we call God
depends upon our tribe, Clark-Joe.
Because God is tribal. God takes sides.
No man in the sky intervened
when I was a boy
to deliver me from
Daddy's fist and abominations. Mmm.
I figured out way back,
if God is all-powerful,
he cannot be all-good.
And if he is all-good,
then he cannot be all-powerful.
And neither can you be.
They need to see the fraud you are.
With their eyes.
The blood on your hands.
What have you done?
Hmm. And tonight, they will.
Yes. Because you, my friend,
have a date. Hmm.
Across the bay.
Ripe fruit, his hate. Two years growing.
But it did not take much
to push him over, actually.
Little red notes, big bang.
You let your family die!
And now you will fly to him.
And you will battle him.
To the death.
Black and blue. Fight Night!
The greatest gladiator match
in the history of the world.
- God versus man.
- (THUNDER RUMBLES)
Day versus night.
Son of Krypton versus Bat of Gotham.
You think I'll fight him for you?
Hmm, yes, I do.
I think you will fight-fight-fight
for that special lady in your life.
She's safe on the ground. How about you?
Close, but I am not talking about Lois.
No.
Every boy's special lady is his mother.
(GASPS)
Martha, Martha, Martha.
Hmm.
Why, the mother of a flying demon
must be a witch.
The punishment for witches, what is that?
That's right. Death by fire.
Mmm. (CHUCKLES)
(BREATHING HEAVILY) Where is she?
I don't know!
I would not let them tell me!
Now... (VOCALIZES)
If you kill me, Martha dies.
And if you fly away, mmm,
Martha also dies.
But if you kill the Bat...
Martha lives.
There we go. There we go. Hmm.
And now God bends to my will.
(HELICOPTER APPROACHING)
Ooh, now the cameras
are waiting at your ship.
For the world to see
the holes in the holy.
Yes, the Almighty comes clean
about how dirty he is when it counts.
To save Martha,
bring me the head of the Bat.
Ah.
Mother of God, would you look at the time?
When you came here, you had an hour.
Now it's less.
(TICKING)
ANDERSON COOPER:
CNN's own Brooke Baldwin is on the scene.
Brooke, you're live on the air.
What are you seeing?
There's something happening at the ship.
It's sending massive power surges.
ERIKA ERICKSON:
Police helicopters surrounding the area.
They've created a barricade
around this containment center.
And we're trying to get a little bit
closer here to find out what's going on.
It is absolute chaos.
You can see that lightning,
those surges of electricity.
They seem to be getting
stronger by the minute.
Daily Planet.
Lois.
I have to go to Gotham
to convince him to help me.
Who?
Or he has to die.
Clark.
No one stays good in this world.

Call the heliport.
Chopper? We can barely afford a bicycle.
You wanna chase a story? Go to the ship.
Superman's probably there already.
Perry, it's not for a story.
Jenny, get her a chopper to Gotham.
And forget the heliport.
Put it on the goddamn roof.
On the roof, Lois!
Where are we headed?
There!
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
Well, here I am.
Bruce. Please.
I was wrong. You have to listen to me.
Lex wants us to...

They taught me the world only
makes sense if you force it to.

You were never a God.
You were never even a man.
(STRAINING)
You're letting him kill Martha.

What does that mean?
Why did you say that name?
Find him.
Save
Martha.
THOMAS: Martha.
(PEARLS CLATTERING)
(SCREAMING INAUDIBLY)
Martha.
Why did you say that name?
Martha! Why did you say that name?
Clark! Stop!

Why did you say that name?
It's his mother's name.
It's his mother's name. (PANTING)

We're still right outside

A dangerous situation.
Military and police personnel

CLARK: Luthor.
He wanted your life for hers.
She's losing time.
The scout ship seems to be
drawing power from the city.
It's got to be Lex.
They need you at that ship. I'll find her.
- My mother needs me.
- Wait.
I'll make you a promise.
Martha won't die tonight.
ALFRED: Master Wayne.
Alfred.
Uh, I'm sorry for listening in,
but I've tracked the Russian's phone
to a warehouse near the port.
You're locked onto it.
KNYAZEV: I'm afraid this is goodbye.
And every time we say goodbye,
you die a little.
(BAT PLANE APPROACHING)
MAN 1: Take it down.
MAN 2: Go! Go!

I gave the Bat a fighting chance to do it,

Thankfully though, the work day is over

It's nearly empty.
Now military aircraft.
Those are Apache helicopters.
They have now just arrived.
The images that...

The spear. Alfred, the spear.
It's pure Kryptonite.
It's back in Gotham.
If I can penetrate the skin,
the spear will kill it.
It would in theory.

Perhaps they don't want to be found.
They will. And they'll fight.
We have to stand together.

A hundred years ago,
I walked away from mankind.
