How come they know it all?
You should've seen the poor fella.
Frano's an animal.
He should be put down.
You can drop that 30,000 you owe
me into me later.
All this hassle for a fella
you hardly know.
If John Boy covers the money
it's done.
I need more gear.
Get it off Potsy's brother.
I don't like him.
I'm not into you.
< He thinks I tried to have
him clipped.
I didn't know Stumpy
was going to do that.
It'd square us with Fran. He's making
bags of cash with the tobacco smuggling.
Aren't fellas always complaining.
Once they get married they
don't get it at home enough.
How do you know I'm not?
Cos you never got enough, did you.
Thanks for the loan.
Got me out of a bind.
I know I owe you.
PHONE RINGS..
MACHINE: Hi, this is Debbie. Leave
a message, I'll get back to you.
It's me. Answer your fucking
phone sometime.
PHONE RINGS..
Alright. How's it going?
Good, yeah.
Going to leave them at it soon.
It'll be done by the morning.
Okay. Ring me later.
Yeah. Talk you later.
You've only the one company, right.
Say in the Isle of Man or Jersey.
And CAB want to know who owns it. They
just ring up and find out it's you.
But if they can track one company
they can track all of them, right?
They can but they won't. If you
have it in different jurisdictions.
Jersey, the Isle of Man, Saint Lucia.
You'll have them chasing their tail.
They've to get court orders
in all three countries.
You think they're going to fly some
pen pusher to all those places?
Waste of time, unless you're
Pablo fuckin' Escobar.
And I can access the cash
anywhere, yeah?
Yeah. You get your little black
book with all your account numbers
and your access codes and you take
care of it. You'll be grand.
How come you know all this shit?
Cos I done my Leaving Cert.
And you didn't.
The only tricky bit is
lodging the money.
Getting it over through customs.
You have to have it in cash
so there's no paper trail.
I'll need a lilywhite.
You're late.
Sorry. I got held up.
Don't be getting locked, Potsy.
You have the van, yeah? Yeah.
Right then. Let's step it up lads.
PHONE RINGS..
Hiya.
Yeah. Give me half an hour.
I'll see you at the place.
I've some stuff to do.
Are you on top of this? Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.
Alright, see you later.
Alright Pat.
I don't want you here.
I know that you think the
accident with your daughter,
that that was me but
it wasn't me.
I don't want you near me.
I don't want you near my family.
Look Pat, I'll be out of your
hair in a second.
All I wanted to see was what's
happening with the files.
I've got a new guy now. Wants to
know could you courier them over
to him as soon as you
get the chance.
This is his card.
Will you do that for me Pat?
Alright. Alright.
You got away in any way. Yeah.
Frano down the pub, is he?
So did you not bring me
flowers Nigel?
No. Did you want flowers?
You didn't bring me flowers?
I wasn't thinking.
What were you thinking?
Meet her, bang her and go. No.
What then?
I don't know. We don't
have to do anything.
I'm happy just to have a chat.
Want to stay here or..
There's more space in my car.
Do we need guns for this, no?
If we have guns, we use them.
Kill a cop it's 40 years.
This is shit.
What's the point in having a hole in the
wall if there's fuck all money in it.
Worried in case they get robbed.
Get more money on scratch cards.
It's enough for me to keep
John Boy off my back for now.
Then what?
Then we rob another 2 or 3 of these
and I don't owe the prick nothing.
Yeah, that hit the spot.
Where are you going?
I'll be back in an hour.
What's the panic?
We're nearly done.
Fuck off man, will ya.
Prick.
Speedball.
Do you want one?
Go on, they're bleedin' lovely,
they are.
Fuck yeah, go on.
Hang on. Hang on.
Are you alright?
Okay, it's alright.
Oh shit. Sorry.
Keep going.
Hang on. Hang on.
I needed that.
Yeah. Yeah.
Are you not getting it at home, no?
It was a joke.
It wasn't funny.
Say that shit to anyone, guaranteed
Fran will hear about this.
I'm not going to tell anyone.
Just need a fuck from time to time
Nidge. I don't need any hassle.
You think I want hassle?
Alright.
Fuck it.
Aido. Cops.
They feel real.
He got them for me as a birthday
present.
You got your money's worth.
Don't be at my nipple.
It doesn't twist off.
Sorry.
PHONE RINGS.. Man, what now?
Is it home?
Alright John Boy, what's
the story?
Fuck.
I pay you to do nixers, do I?
You're getting your blood
on my floor.
Here.
I'm going to watch TV
in the other room.
So Stumpy. Are you a rat or what?
I'm not a rat.
Maybe you think you're a clever rat.
You were told to be there
and you left the place.
There's no way I'm a rat.
You better not be.
I'm not. Don't give me the look.
Do you know what they
do to rats down in Mexico?
This one rat last week,
they cut off his head.
Then the cut the face off the head.
Then they sewed the face, all of it,
the skin everything.
They sewed it onto a football and
left it out in the front garden
for his kids to play with.
Do you know anything about that?
What are you going to do
to make it up to me?
Whatever you want.
This is going to hurt my pocket
so it's going to hurt yours too.
Sure.
There's going to be a penalty on
you being stupid and being lazy
and fuckin' off when you were
supposed to stay put where you were.
You've got money somewhere,
hole in the ground? Yeah.
Dig it up, bring it here
and don't run.
Cos if you run like a rat, who's
going to look after your Ma?
Now fuck off.
What'll we do?
Whack a rat, that's what we'll do.
You see it. Yeah, what is it?
That's mad, that is.
MARY: It's his anniversary Darren.
Come on, for me.
I feel like I'm betraying
him or something.
By working for John Boy again? Yeah.
He's my little brother. I could've
looked out for him better.
It wasn't your fault Darren.
It was.
He got into it cos I got into it.
I know that, you know that.
Darren. You're not cut out
for the life you're leading.
I know.
I know you have to pay off that money
but I hate that you're doing it.
What you're doing, the people
you come in contact with.
And I can't have you bringing
it to my door. I know that.
I don't want the girls
to see any of that.
I know. I'm sorry.
You're not like Nidge
or even Tommy or the others.
You're kind.
That's why Rosie loved you.
You want to lead that life? No.
You need to stop working
with these scumbags.
It doesn't matter who they are.
We both know where it leads.
Robbie had no sense at all, you know.
But you do.
Come up with me to visit him,
will you?
Yeah, okay.
I know you're right.
This is the last of it for me.
Okay?
Come on.
I hate that Hughie's buried
up here, the same ground.
Well he's dead now so fuck him.
John Boy wants to see you.
Ah man, I'm in bits.
2 hours is all I need.
I stink. I need a kip.
Okay but make it quick.
BUZZER RINGS..
PHONE RINGS..
Alright, I'm outside.
Potsy's fucked cos he was in
the room. Won't even get bail.
Aido, I think they have him
on fingerprints.
They still have him in but
he'll get bail more than likely.
Tommy was in the corridor
so he was lucky.
He said he got rid of
his gloves so.. you know.
Rise of the foot soldier.
What?
You. You're all in the thick
of it, aren't you.
Moving and shaking, talking to
lawyers. Getting fuckin' updates.
That I can get myself off Aertel.
You asked me to.
Yeah but I asked you to bring Tommy
over as well and he's not here.
I'll get him to come over now. Yeah,
get him to come over here and wait.
Cos I'm going out now and
when I'm back I'm back.
I don't care what happens,
you tell him to wait for me
cos I want to know what the fuck
him and that other clown were doing
out in the corridor and not in the room
like they were supposed to be. Right.
< Where are you going Stephen?
Bursting for a piss Ma.
The alarm fella here yet?
What happened your head?
Nothing Ma.
Your colleague said there was no point in
putting the alarm in if the lock was broken.
The sensors won't work
if the lock's broken.
That's why Stephen had new
doors put in for me.
Alright Ma.
Stephen, what happened to you? Slipped.
Whacked my head on car door.
Let me see. Did you get stitches?
Forget about it.
Did you give her a panic button? Yeah, she has a fob.
She can have it with her all the time.
Does that call the guards?
We've a 24 hour monitoring system.
Then we call the guards.
Now Ma. Safe as houses.
Cash alright for you?
You know anything about that
raid on the hotel Martin?
Not much like.
The lads in the station were
talking about it alright.
Is someone ratting me out?
I honestly wouldn't know.
So you can't tell me anything?
Just what the lads were saying.
There was one of your boys spotted
lying in a hall, out of it.
It was rung it so.. Security saw
them on CCTV acting suspicious.
It doesn't mean I don't have a rat.
This is a new number for you.
Check your messages, yeah.
Here.
Should keep you in rent boys for a
month the way you go through them.
Man, I'm sickened I am.
You don't even want to know
how much I'm out of pocket.
Want a cup of tea or anything?
No. Here.
What's this?
Some of what I owe John Boy.
What are you giving to to me for?
Will you not give it to him?
I can have the rest for him
in the next couple of weeks.
Have some nixer, have you?
You give it to him when you
have it all. It's better.
You know what he's like.
You give it to him, will you?
Alright.
Did you ring him? No.
Going mad, is he? Yeah.
It's not your fault, is it?
I just want to get some water.
I'll get you the water.
Do you want to smoke a joint? No.
You never met Cueball? No.
John Boy's brother, Hughie.
Total head the ball.
Thanks.
Who's the fella with the army
hat on?
Don't know.
What are you doing?
It's arnica.
Lift up your t-shirt.
You're grand.
Go on. No.
It'll help. Go on.
I think it's Collins.
Michael Collins.
Does that feel better?
Yeah.
I know most of them.
That's Tupaq, Biggy,
Bob Marley, JFK,
Here. What about...? Ssh.
Alright.
What's the story with Frano anyway?
He's having the wobbles.
It's a lot of money,
that's all I'm saying.
Fran, I took the hit on that.
It's got nothing to do with you.
I know.
Thanks.
Sorry John. I was watching all that
shit on the telly and I was thinking
that could be my gear, my money
and then what.
Fran. That had nothing
to do with your money.
Your money's already gone to Spain.
I was worried. It's a lot of money.
Are you having a wobble?
Yeah. That's okay.
I have them myself. That's normal.
Are you alright? I'm alright.
I fuckin' know it's a lot of money.
But shit happens.
How do you think the cops
got onto you?
How do you know it won't
happen again?
Cos we had a little bit of a problem
with someone mouthing off.
But they'll be taken care of.
Alright.
Fuck it.
Are you going to start acting all
weird round me now and avoid me? No.
I need you to get me some more gear.
Don't look at me like that.
I'm only smoking it.
All the stuff was taken.
I'm not saying right now.
You can get me some zimmos for now.
Hi hun.
Come here.
Sit down.
So you were asleep in the hallway.
That means you'll get off.
So either you're a rat or
you're stupid.
I think you're stupid.
So I'm going to give you
two choices.
Either you pay me back for your
fuck up or you do something for us.
I need someone to go through
customs for me with cash.
No problem, yeah. Not you.
Who? Siobhan.
Alright. That's from Darren.
What's that?
It's some of what he owes you.
He asked me to give it to you.
You know what that is.
It's fuck you money.
That's what that is.
Ungrateful bastard.
I talked to my fella today.
Waste of space. Parking fines
is all he's good for.
Is Stumpy the rat?
He doesn't know. But something's
not right with him.
Doing his side deals, driving
that flash motor.
He's ripping me off, I know he is.
You think?
Can you not smell it off him?
Want me to keep an eye on him?
Sure that's no use to me. Waiting
around for a rat to rat us out.
Whatever you want.
He needs to be sorted.
No problem.
I'll tell you what I want.
I want Darren to do it.
He still owes me.
It's Stumpy we're talking about,
not fuckin' Mother Teresa.
He had a crack at you himself.
I'll pay John Boy all the money
back this week.
This is what the wants.
What's the problem?
Rosie.
Rosie, what do you mean?
What if she was to come back?
And what, she's going to care
if Stumpy's dead or not?
After what he done to her
she'd be over the moon.
No she wouldn't.
She wouldn't want it.
You think if she's back here
she wants to cross over the street
every time she sees that tosser? I know
but she wouldn't want me doing it.
How the fuck would she knew unless
you told her?
Why would you tell her anyway?
Stump's pissed enough people off.
She asks you, you say you know
fuck all about it.
Don't want to do it.
Why the fuck not?
I don't want to kill anybody.
Not even Stumpy?
No, I don't want to do it.
I don't.
It's a bit late in the day,
to be honest with you Darren.
This puts me in the shit as well.
I'll be straight up with you.
I don't give a shit about anyone,
man.
I don't give a shit.
Except for Warren.
The rest, I don't care.
Not even Trish.
I love her and all but
I don't give a shit.
I'll do whatever the fuck it is
I have to do.
I'll do it, I don't care.
I'll get on with it.
There's no way out for you in
this Darren.
Straight up, there's no way out.
I wouldn't bullshit you.
You have to do it and that's it.
You don't do it, whatever happens
happens and you're thinking
I'm in all this shit cos of Stumpy.
I'm telling you Darren, you're
fucked if you don't do this.
Fuck knows what'll happen but
I swear to God it'll happen
and you'll have pissed it all away.
Understand?
Yeah.
Good.
Only ring me on this one for this.
The number's in it.
I'll call you when it's time.
Why does he want me to do it?
Cos you won't get stopped.
I could easily get stopped.
Then what?
Why don't you do it? I would
but he wants you to do it.
They'd know me anyway.
If I got caught with he court case
coming up, it wouldn't look good.
Would they not know me then
if they know you?
They wouldn't be looking out for you.
What if I get arrested?
You won't. They won't stop you.
I go to prison and what about
Leyton?
You won't cos you'd say
the money wasn't yours.
The judge would believe you
cos you don't have a record.
Siobhan. Don't do it if you
don't want to.
What happens to you if
I don't do it?
I'll do it, okay.
Thanks.
I don't know what else
I could've done.
You could've said no.
PHONE RINGS..
Story Stumpy.
I have some of that money for John
Boy if you want to get it off me.
Yeah alright.
< Were you talking to him?
Yeah.
I'm alright, am I?
He's cool, man.
He's pissed off and all but you'd
be pissed off if you were him.
I wouldn't talk to anybody,
you know that.
I know that.
Pay him the money you owe and he'll
get over it. I'll talk to him.
Thanks Nidge.
You're in tomorrow?
Yeah, I'll be down the gym.
I'll bring some of that money
for John Boy.
Right, see you then. Sound.
It's on tomorrow.
Get rid of yer man for a minute.
Bud, can I have a word?
Aido, I have to talk to you.
All okay, yeah? Yeah.
How's Potsy? He's alright.
He's hoping to get bail so
he could skip.
What about you?
You thinking of skipping?
No. No way man.
If I get put away it'll be a break.
I know loads of them in there
anyway. Half my cousins.
You need to sign up to a treatment
programme, you know that.
It looks better for you.
Drug addict, fucked up family.
You were forced to do this to pay
off a drug debt.
Judge will feel sorry for you.
It'd be good for you anyway Aido.
You junkie fuck.
I don't give a bollocks what you do
in your spare time.
But you fucked this for me.
I know you did.
I know that you fucked this up
for me. You and your brother.
Junkie fucks.
You don't say anything except
what I tell you to say.
Do you hear me?
Alright John.
GUNSHOT..
There's only the one, is there?
That's all we need.
Do I not need one, no? No.
I was going to wait till the last minute
to rob a car so it's not reported.
Have you never done this before?
No.
I'm only saying, I never done it.
> Lord, You are our hope and
our salvation.
Send Your Holy Spirit to turn
our darkness into light
and our falseness into truth.
Where are you going? My sister's
having a mass for my brother.
Come on. What?
May He fill us with hope and
the power of the Holy Spirit.
Lord, You are our help and
our salvation.
Almighty Father, send..
Sorry Father. Sorry Mary.
> Send Your Holy Spirit to
turn our words into prayers and
our seeking into finding.
Hi hun.
Jesus. I'm so fuckin' tired
these days.
What you all dressed up for?
I'm meeting Kayleigh.
Oh.
My daughter Kayleigh.
Yeah I knew that, hun.
I forgot that was today. I said
I'd meet her with you, didn't I.
It's up to you.
Is it okay if I give it a
miss today?
I'd prefer to meet her when
I'm on top form.
Cos I'd like her to like me..
Alright Nidge.
Looks like paint. No, it's top
notch stuff. Chinese make it.
Chinese could be putting all
sorts of shit in it.
Have you got John Boy's money
for me?
I have it in the car.
I was going to give it to you later.
Give it to me now if it's handy.
I'll lock it in the car.
See you in there, yeah.
Yeah man.
What's wrong with you?
You're all jittery.
No I'm not. It's nothing,
I'm grand.
Who's yer man anyway?
Did I not tell you about him? Luke.
I didn't think you'd mind
me bringing him.
He's got no family of his own.
He was an orphan.
Him and his brother were
brought up in a foster home.
What about his brother? He's not
on his own if he has his brother.
His brother's missing.
What happened him?
No-one knows. He just disappeared
one day, never turned up.
Jesus, how long has he
been missing?
Nearly a year. Poor thing.
I didn't think you'd mind me
bringing him. I don't.
Sure Robbie was always bringing
strays home.
I'll take that for you.
How are you Luke?
How's it going.
I didn't get to meet you properly.
I'm Mary, Darren's sister.
I know. Thanks for lunch.
It's nothing.
No, it was good. Fuckin' savage.
Sorry. It was.
I never have grub like that.
Do you never cook for yourself then?
No. I can make a Pot Noodle.
Well that's cooking, isn't it.
I mean I would make one if
I had a kettle. But I don't.
Do you not have a kettle? No.
I think I've an old one if you want.
You can have it. Yeah?
Yeah.
I'll take that for you.
Here. I'm going to hit the road man.
See you later on.
Come here.
Thanks for sorting me out with
John Boy.
Don't worry about it.
It was nothing.
You know what he's like.
See you later.
PHONE RINGS..
Alright. NIGEL: It's on.
Go on.
Hiya Da.
Sorry I'm late.
The bus took ages.
You're not late.
I only just arrived now.
I'm starving.
Well have whatever you want.
Are you alright?
Yeah. I'm buzzing man.
I didn't expect to be but
it was a rush.
