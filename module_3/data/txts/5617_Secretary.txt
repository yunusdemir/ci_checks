Contact Potomac Approach on 335.5.
Roger. Descend and maintain 10,000,
heading 2-7-0.
Pushing approach 335.5.
All right, Henry,
you have the aircraft.
Roger that. I have the aircraft.
You want to try a break turn
to the right?
Roger that.
- Great flying with you, Squatch.
- You, too, Henry.
Hey, what was your call
sign back in the day?
"Prophet," which sounds kind of cool,
but it was not given
for cool reasons, believe me.
Yeah, they never are.
Hairy feet, hence "Squatch."
But hey, anything beats
"Friggin' New Guy," right?
Right. Hey, Congressman.
- Welcome back.
- Thanks.
My friends, this is an exciting time.
The prototype F-40 fighter,
which some of you folks
have been lucky enough
to take a ride in today
is the future of our nation's
air defense.
And thanks to the extraordinary
capabilities of the F-40,
that future looks bright indeed.
Thank you so much for coming.
Now let's enjoy ourselves.
You miss it, right?
Oh, brother,
more than I want to admit.
I can't wait to get up there.
Hey, how's the plane?
Uh, you'll see.
I mean, some stuff is incredible.
But, uh, in terms of actual
speed and maneuverability,
eh, it's kind of a brick.
Some part of that brick is being
manufactured in every district
of every politician in this
place, including mine.
So if he comes over here,
do a Marine brother a favor
and smile, would you?
Sure, Jeff.
Bess.
We're, uh, having an issue
with the F-40,
and we could use your help.
Well, I hope it isn't
too big of an issue,
because Henry's flying in one
as we speak.
Nothing like that.
The F-40's an excellent plane.
- Oh, good.
- As you know,
ten years ago, DOD placed an
initial order of 80 F-40s
from their manufacturer
Fossor Industries.
We just received Fossor's
latest budget estimate.
In order to manufacture
the 80 planes and make it
economically feasible during
the agreed-upon timeline,
Fossor needs to make an even hundred.
And, uh, how much do
the extra 20 cost?
$3.6 billion.
Wow.
We're really gonna let them shake down
the federal government like that?
No, I wouldn't call it a shakedown.
These types of cost overruns
are a feature of defense contracting.
Plus, the different components
of the F-40 are assembled in 40%
of all congressional districts
nationwide.
Which partly explains
the cost overruns,
because logistically,
that makes absolutely no sense.
But politically,
it makes all kinds of sense.
They are the largest
defense contractor
in the world,
so to answer your question,
yes, we really are going to let
them shake us down like that.
I-I wouldn't call it a shakedown, sir.
Where do I come in?
We need to find a home
for those extra 20 jets,
somewhere among
our friends and allies.
And we need to do it fast.
You are no doubt
aware of our pending sale
of military equipment to Taiwan.
We were thinking of adding
the F-40s to that package.
We need State to
perform an expedited review
of the proposed sale.
We need you to convince Taiwan
that buying the jets
would be in their strategic interest.
All due respect, sir,
it isn't in their strategic
interest, or ours.
China's already angry about
the existing arms sale.
It's pro forma posturing.
It happens every time.
Sure, but you tack on
20 next-gen fighter jets
that can reach Beijing in an hour?
Oh, closer to an hour and a half.
- What, I...
- The F-40's a little logy.
It's an excellent plane, Russell.
Regardless, China will see this
as a major provocation.
Not only could
they respond militarily,
but they could also pull out
of the Fair Work and Trade Agreement,
which we are this close to signing,
and which will protect the
health and safety of literally
millions of workers around the world.
The F-40 is the lynchpin of our
entire airborne military posture
for decades to come,
so it has to come first.
I understand, sir.
I'll have my department
do a top secret
feasibility review ASAP.
But... of course, I-I can't
guarantee a specific outcome.
- We hear you, Bess.
- Totally get it.
Huh.
That'll be all.
Mr. President.
Matt.
Whoa... what? What?
- Here.
- Okay.
Waffles. Oh, buddy.
You're in a little Waffles cone.
It's not funny.
- Oh, it is a little funny.
- Not to me.
Because I had to take him
to the 24-hour vet
at 5:30 in the morning.
Joanna threw a toy from her high
chair and scratched his cornea.
- What?
- So for the next three days at work,
you need to give him these
drops every three hours,
- Uh-huh.
- this pain pill every four hours,
- Uh-huh. - and this antibiotic
every six hours, with food.
- Got it? Great.
- Wait.
Why me?
Because you know my mom
only does babysitting,
not doggie daycare, but the dog walker
won't give him the medication
for insurance reasons,
so that means that
I have to bring him here.
But I am neck-deep in messaging
on the Fair Work
and Trade Agreement
and I need to focus.
Oh, yeah, and because
when I adopted Waffles,
you said you'd help.
Hey, I do help. I play
ball with him in the park.
That's not help, that's fun.
This is help. So, help.
Okay, okay. I'm on it. Geez.
Oh, Mommy got all upset,
didn't she? Yes, she did.
Now, you be a good boy
till I come back, okay?
Remember: with food.
To conclude,
I think the best strategy is to get
the Fair Work and Trade
Agreement wrapped up,
finally, and as quickly as possible,
and to lock in all the gains we can
before China gets wind of the
potential sale of the F-40s.
Obviously, that means
keep a tight circle.
Meanwhile, I'd like
all relevant departments
to get their recommendations
on the sale
to my office by the end of the week
so we can make a determination
to pass on to the White House.
Sound good?
Gary, does Political-Military
Affairs have concerns?
Um, I mean, don't you?
Many, which I have expressed
to POTUS, yet here we are.
- Wow.
- Uh, you're welcome to share yours.
Well, for starters, the shortest
road to World War III
probably runs through
the Taiwan Strait.
So, there's that.
China has been increasingly overt
in its effort to force Taiwan
into reintegrating, yes.
Which Taiwan resists, in part,
because they know there is
at least an implied promise
of U.S. support.
And we maintain the status quo
through the problematic
but effective policy
of strategic ambiguity.
Right. We-we know.
So what's your point?
That. That is my point.
It-it...
It's a very delicate balance
here and-and it's... hmm.
L-Look,
does Taiwan want an effective
military deterrent? Of course.
But they don't want
to annoy China into actually
invading them, which is exactly
what this deal could do.
So you're saying Taiwan
may not want the F-40s.
Not "may not," ma'am.
Definitely won't.
Then perhaps, as
we do from time to time,
we incentivize the purchase.
A loan to offset the costs.
Sure. Why not?
We'll get to work drafting a proposal.
Super. Blake will liaise
with your department on that.
And I don't disagree with you, Gary.
State will give POTUS
an honest assessment
of the potential impact of the deal,
and hopefully,
that'll be the end of it.
But at the end of the day,
we serve at the pleasure.
Understood, ma'am.
Good. Thanks, everybody.
We're giving Taiwan money
to buy jets they don't want
because we don't want them, either?
It makes sense once
you accept that it doesn't.
Talk about strategic ambiguity.
This town's built on it.
Buy me a drink sometime
and I'll explain
how untrammeled corporate greed
distorts our foreign policy
and will one day lead to the
collapse of the United States
and very probably,
civilization writ large.
Sounds fun.
Okay. Later.
See you.
Hey, babe.
Hey, how was your joyride?
Was it joyful?
Did you have a joyful ride?
- It was so great.
- Uh-huh.
I mean, like I told Jeff,
the plane's kind of a brick,
but it was fantastic
being up there again.
Well, I'm glad you had fun,
because waiting for you
on the ground was a real treat for me.
Mm-hmm.
Bed.
Hey, why do you say
that the F-40 is a brick?
Well, to be fair, there's a lot
of impressive aspects...
the avionics, the sensor suite.
Like, if a bandit locks you up...
- Back to English, honey.
- Uh, sorry.
Basically, it has
all these bells and whistles,
like stealth technology,
but they had to give up
a lot of performance
to cram it all in there.
Plus, they're trying to make one
fighter jet to meet the needs
of three different branches
of the military.
It's kind of like
a fighter by committee.
That's a ringing endorsement.
Too slow to fight, too big to fail.
Yes?
Evening, Minister Chen.
This is a surprise.
"Surprise" is indeed an apt
word, Madam Secretary.
China had already made
its extreme displeasure
over your proposed arms sale
to the breakaway province
of Taiwan quite clear to Washington.
But now we learn that you plan
to add insult to injury.
Uh, I'm not sure that I follow, Ming.
If you attempt to sell Taiwan
even one F-40 fighter...
China will regard that
as a grave provocation
and respond accordingly.
Ming, I don't know where you heard...
To begin with...
we will suspend our participation
in the Fair Work and Trade Agreement.
More to the point:
we will prepare ourselves militarily
against this dire threat
to Chinese sovereignty.
I warn you, Madam Secretary,
you are crossing a red line.
How the hell did China find out about
the F-40 sale to Taiwan so quick?
Mr. President, NSA intercepted
communications between
Chinese officials
referencing an internal
State Department memo
generated by the Bureau
of Political-Military Affairs.
So you're saying the
leak came from my shop?
Certainly appears that way.
DOJ and FBI is opening
an investigation
to find the source.
We'd appreciate your
cooperation, Madam Secretary.
Of course.
My department's at your disposal,
whatever you want.
We, uh, have to stay away from it.
So the investigation stays free
of any political interference.
Yes, clearly.
We're only talking a few dozen
potential suspects here.
Whoever it is might be close to home.
You sure it'll be so clear then?
Yeah, Russell, I am.
Do you have a suspect?
We do.
Good.
Meanwhile, we'll, uh,
move forward with the sale
of the jets to Taiwan.
Mr. President, I can tell
when Chen is posturing.
Tonight, he was not.
Neither am I.
China doesn't get to infiltrate
the top echelon
of our government and then turn around
and say that we're not playing fair.
It demands a tough response.
I understand that, but I'm just saying
that there could be repercussions.
There always are.
That's all.

Not in trouble, am I?
Well, I think under
those circumstances...
Ma'am?
You wanted to see me?
Yeah. Blake, thanks for coming in.
These are Special Agents Smalls
and Brock from the FBI.
They just want to ask you
a few questions.
Please, have a seat, Mr. Moran.
O-Okay.
I'm not just there for the good times.
It's like, I-I pitch in
whenever she asks me to.
It's like, how am I supposed to know
that-that she needs help
if she doesn't speak to me?
It's like, you know, hello?
I'm not a mind reader.
I mean, I get that she's got
a lot on her plate,
but I'm-I'm pretty busy, too.
You know? You know?
I'm either... calling Captain Ronnie
crazy early in the morning,
crazy late at night in Korea,
it's just... it's exhausting.
There's more than one
side to the story,
is all I'm trying to say.
Oh, look.
It's first thing in the morning,
and I'm already tired.
Listen, buddy, I'm gonna...
just close my eyes for a hot sec.
Before the day gets going, so...
If you want to cuddle with me...
- Catch up with you guys in a minute.
- Sure.
Matt!
You got to stop doing that.
I thought you had him.
I thought I had him, too.
- Bad dog.
- No. Bad you.
Careful.
Not cool, little dude.
Not cool.
The evidence points to the leaker
being someone from Pol-Mil.
Currently, our prime suspect
is Deputy Assistant Secretary Martin.
You think Gary Martin is a spy?
I'm sorry, that just seems
a bit, uh... far-fetched.
How would you describe
your relationship
with the undersecretary, Mr. Moran?
Um... we've worked on
a few projects together,
so, friendly, I guess.
I mean, as friendly as you can
be with a professional grouch.
- So you would say he's disgruntled?
- Uh, no.
No, I-I don't mean that.
I think that...
He has a long and
well-documented history
of fierce criticism
of U.S. foreign policy.
Just as I'm sure long-time DOJ hands
have criticism
of U.S. criminal justice policy.
And numerous personal contacts
within the Chinese military
and intelligence establishment.
Yes, that-that's his job.
I'm-I'm sorry.
Blake, I admire Gary, too.
But the bottom line is that his office
generated a highly classified
memo that...
in less than a single day,
found its way
into the hands of the Chinese.
I offered my department's
support of this investigation
because it represents a grave threat
to our national security.
But you're not obligated
to participate, so...
if you don't want to do so,
you're free to go.
You know, every time
I passed by this place,
I thought it was out of business.
Possibly condemned.
No, just defiantly un-yuppified.
Old-school.
You could smoke in here
until, like, last year.
Evening, guys.
Get you started with a cocktail?
No thanks, they don't
make me those anymore.
Ginger ale, please.
Uh, can I see your wine list?
Yeah. I'll have a martini with,
uh, your least-worst vodka.
Sure.
Gary,
why did you say we should get a drink
if you don't drink?
It's a thing people say.
Let's cut to the chase.
No one from work wants
to hang out with me socially.
Ever.
Go figure.
So, my guess is that the
secretary sent you here
to find something out.
Sound about right?
Gary, don't you think you're being
just a little... paranoid here?
Castle, this is Ranger.
We're inside the apartment.
That's what Meg says, too.
My girlfriend.
Yeah, I don't know why
she stays with me, either.
But I always say, "No, honey,
I just see things clearly."
So...
What would the secretary
even want to know about?
Deflecting my question with
a leading question of your own.
I can see why you're
shooting up the ranks.
Maybe the secretary wants to check in
after my little rant
about the Taiwan deal.
Am I right?
Look, am I passionate
about wanting this country
to base its foreign policy
on our values...
instead of some defense
contractor's bottom line?
Yes.
About the fact that State
often gets overruled
while the Pentagon drains the
nation's coffers to the tune of
literally trillions
of dollars to make us
less safe over the long term?
Sure.
Guilty.
But ask the secretary.
Since when is caring a crime?
Anyway.
To seeing things clearly.
Yeah. Cheers.
Mr. President, it appears...
that Undersecretary Martin
is not responsible for the leak.
Our investigators determined
that the memo file on his laptop
had been copied onto a USB drive.
We caught a lucky break
when we found a purchase
for a USB drive
on the credit card statement
of this woman.
His long-time girlfriend,
Megan Morrison.
So, she has some connection
to the Chinese.
Actually, sir, under questioning,
she revealed that she passed
along the State Department memo
to an employee at Fossor Industries.
Are you kidding?
What?
She was a spy... for Fossor?
And then unknown
parties at the company
appear to have passed it
on to Chinese intelligence.
Why on earth
would one of our nation's
top defense contractors
pass secrets to an adversary?
Because if State recommended
the U.S. not sell Taiwan
the extra 20 F-40s,
that could throw the sale
of the other 80 into doubt.
Then we'd be talking
billions of dollars,
years of R&D down the drain.
But if China found out about the sale,
they'd hit the roof,
and threaten holy hell
if we went through with it.
Which, in turn,
would ensure that we would.
Son of a bitch.
Fossor's trying to box us in.
Not if I have anything
to say about it.
I want to have a little talk
with Fossor's CEO.
So are we sure about this?
Speak now or forever hold your peace.
Sir, Fossor has widespread
support on the Hill.
Angry as I am,
this is not a fight
we're prepared for.
Nevertheless, it's the fight we're in.
They put their corporate interests
above the United States,
they have to pay a price.
It's a big swing, Mr. President.
There could be major military
readiness issues downstream.
Which is the problem, in my view.
We've become so dependent
on companies like Fossor
that we're scared
to hold them accountable.
This is exactly the kind
of corrosive situation
that Eisenhower warned us about
in his "military-industrial
complex" speech.
Hank.
As to the particular
legal question at hand,
you're on solid ground, sir.
Well, I for one am a little tired
of the tail wagging the dog, so...
let's go.
Mr. President,
we've received the subpoena
and have been in touch
with the Justice Department.
The charges against Fossor
are scurrilous and absurd,
and we intend to fight them
to the last breath.
It's also highly improper for
you to be contacting us at all.
Oh, I can assure you,
I wouldn't do anything
to compromise the case, Mr. Champlin.
We're calling for another reason.
Secretary Becker.
Mr. Champlin, on behalf of the
Department of Defense,
I am formally alerting you
that we are exercising
our "Termination of Convenience"
clause with respect to the F-40.
You can't just cancel
a $31 billion contract.
With all due respect, Mr. Champlin,
yes, we can. And we are.
I'm very sorry to hear that,
Mr. President.
Good day, Mr. Champlin.
- I can't believe it.
- M-Sec thought you should know.
Wait, so, h-his girlfriend was
some kind of sleeper agent
for Fossor the whole time?
Uh... they got their hooks
into her a few years back.
She had debts.
Fossor knew that Gary
played an important role
in vetting overseas arms sales,
so they kept her in their back pocket
until they needed her.
What's gonna happen to Gary?
Well, career-wise, he's toast.
You don't take top secret
files home on your laptop.
The good news is, now that the F-40s
aren't going to Taiwan,
the Fair Work and Trade Agreement's
back on the table with China.
The secretary's planning
an off-books meeting
with Chen in Quebec to try
and get him on board again.
And if she does, then we got
a lot of work to do.
So, be ready to rock and roll, okay?
Yeah, absolutely.
Man... poor Gary.
- I-I just feel bad is all.
- Don't.
He was a suspect in
a massive intelligence breach.
You were on the right side.
Hey, I-I know Gary
wasn't your cup of tea,
but why are you being
so harsh about this?
Because this work we do
is life or death,
and the parties that we deal with
are playing for keeps.
And they'll exploit any
weakness that they can find.
And you need to
understand that from the jump
if you don't want to
wind up like Gary, okay?
Okay.
If the illegal and provocative sale
of F-40 fighters to the
breakaway province of Taiwan
is in fact cancelled,
then I see no reason why we
cannot continue negotiations
on the Fair Work and Trade Agreement.
That's great. Great.
Well, I look forward
to working with you again.
On behalf of the rest of the world,
I say it's about time.
Well, I'm not entirely surprised,
but I am relieved
that we were able to have
such a productive conversation.
As am I, Elizabeth.
I think the most surprising
part of the evening was...
they really do say "aboot."
This isn't gonna surprise anyone,
but China's demanding
a last-minute change
on one of the provisions in the
Fair Work and Trade Agreement,
so now we have to contact all
the other signatory countries
- to get their feedback.
- That's crazy.
If China wants the change,
why don't they contact
all the other countries?
Well, look, China's giving up a lot
just by signing the agreement.
So?
So, we got China into this.
The least America can do
is help out a little, Matt.
Maybe if China was being honest
and communicative about their needs,
America wouldn't have to scramble
to pick up the slack, Daisy.
Well, maybe if America was
a tiny bit more sensitive
- to what China's been going through...
- Oh, sensitive? Sensitive?
Maybe China and America should
talk about this somewhere else.
Okay, everybody, let's circle
back to this in five.
Matt, Daisy.
Well, I'm sorry I encouraged you
to adopt Waffles,
who you totally love.
I guess I am the bad guy here.
No, no, just the unreliable guy.
Okay, so I understand...
we're negotiating
an historic agreement
with our greatest rival,
and you guys are quarreling
about a dog?
Well, anything sounds trivial
when you put it like that.
All right, well, Abby and I
have had a lot of success
in dealing with scheduling
issues around, uh, childcare,
by sharing a calendar.
Could that be an answer?
He'd probably just sleep
through the alerts.
- I fell asleep one time.
- Yeah, in one day.
Okay, okay. Daisy,
how much time per week
do you need someone to take Waffles?
Honestly, right now, three days.
And you know my building
doesn't allow pets.
So what do you want me
to do about that?
Oh, come on.
I'm sorry.
What's going on?
Matt's right.
He did say at the outset
his building doesn't allow dogs.
But I was concerned,
when I first adopted Waffles,
that I wouldn't have the
resources to take care of him
in the way that he deserves.
And as much as it breaks my heart...
...I think I'm gonna have to
find a new home for him.
Wait, are you serious?
You got any better ideas?
Oh, sorry, am I...
No, it's fine. What's up, Nina?
The secretary wants
to see you right away.
I didn't push POTUS
- into anything.
- Oh, come on.
We both know you've got his ear.
You-you wanted to see me, ma'am?
- Yes.
- We've got a problem.
We won't get into
of whose making it is.
I thought we could use your expertise
from your time on the Hill.
I didn't.
This happened just a few minutes ago.
- Congressman Brandt.
- Here we go.
Ladies and gentlemen, please.
When I heard that President
Dalton ordered the cancellation
of the F-40 fighter...
the key to our nation's
future air defense...
I was alarmed.
When I found out why,
I became enraged.
Turns out the president
just can't bring himself to sell
20 F-40s to our good friends
in Taiwan,
who so desperately want and need them.
- Okay, that's a lie.
- Oh, he's just getting started.
And why?
Because he and Secretary of
State Elizabeth McCord
thought it was more important
to appease their real friends,
the Chinese.
Look how cozy those two are.
That's why I've introduced
an emergency rider
to the upcoming spending bill.
The president may be comfortable
with killing tens of thousands
of jobs across the nation,
endangering our friends in Taiwan,
and putting our nation's
security at risk,
but I am not.
Thank you.
Fossor's flexing its muscle
on the Hill
to try to force us to
go through with the contract.
Unbelievable.
So, unless the three of us
figure something out quick,
looks like our only
choice is either to
shut down the government or...
let them get away with it.
You hear that?
That's the sound of Eisenhower
turning in his grave.
I'm on record as having doubts.
Well, we have to
at least give Congress
a chance to do the right thing
and vote no
on that stupid rider.
Well, forgive me if I'm
less than sanguine
about appealing to the better angels
of the hacks on the
Appropriations Committee.
- Any better ideas? David, hi.
- Hi.
Thank you for coming
to represent Taiwan.
And, Jeff, thank you
for pulling this together
on such short notice,
and with such discretion.
I'm pretty curious
why POTUS tried to cancel the
Fossor deal in the first place.
Well, it's a...
It's a doozy.
I'm all ears.
Hi, everyone. Thank you for coming.
I know the president's
cancellation of the contract
with Fossor caught many
of you off guard.
So let me say that we well understand
the historic and important role
that Fossor Industries plays
in our national defense.
Not to mention the tens of thousands
of jobs they create.
And we should hasten to add
the F-40's an excellent plane.
Yeah. But the fact is...
Fossor engaged in espionage
against the State Department,
and then leaked top secret material
pertaining to the potential sale
of the F-40 to the Chinese
to force us to go
forward with the deal.
Lastly,
Congressman Brandt falsely claimed
that Taiwan desperately wants
those extra F-40s.
To rebut that assertion
once and for all,
I yield the floor to David Yu,
from the Taipei Economic
and Cultural Office.
We don't want the jets.
Seriously, we don't.
Please don't send them.
Thank you, David. Thanks.
If you vote for Brandt's rider,
you'll be voting to risk
shutting down the government,
endangering the national
interest on behalf of a company
whose actions show it
only cares for its own.
Please... vote no.
Thank you for your time.
Thank you.
Jeff. Hey.
What was the sense in the room?
Hard to say.
What? Did they not hear
what Elizabeth said?
Look, as long as these
spying allegations
against Fossor remain unproven,
members have political cover
to stick with them.
- Wow.
- There's a facility in my district.
Manufactures the wing-fluid
delivery systems for the F-40.
That's 200 high-paying American jobs.
Adding the tax base,
local businesses...
More important, they're not just jobs.
They're people.
Look, Jeff, I'm not a congressman.
But I was a Marine pilot,
just like you.
And I swore an oath
to defend the Constitution,
not a corporation.
And I sure as hell wouldn't send
one of my brothers
and sisters in arms on a sortie
in a plane I didn't believe in.
The Secretary of Defense
says it's fine.
Well, you know better?
Okay.
Thanks for setting the meeting up.
Tell me that's ginger ale.
Listen, I appreciate
the concern, I guess,
but how about we take a
rain check on whatever this is?
I wanted to say I'm sorry.
For pretending to be my friend
so the Feds could toss my place?
Hey, no problem, pal.
I'm lucky they didn't fire me.
I screwed up with the laptop,
I own that.
But you know what really hurts?
I mean, bes...
besides the Meg of it all,
which I won't go into, other than to say
I spent the last ten Thanksgivings
with her senile, but also racist dad,
which was a barrel of laughs,
and this is the thanks I get.
What hurts
is that they could think
that someone who has fought
as hard as I have
to make our foreign policy
actually line up with our values
could be a spy,
that I would ever
sell this country out.
Ah...
That hurts pretty damn bad.
What do you do now?
Um...
take my pension, get out of Dodge.
Find a small town,
lay low for a while.
What about Boston?
I checked in with
some friends at Harvard.
The Kennedy School is looking
for a Senior Fellow.
You'd make a great teacher, Gary.
Eh, you're just saying that
'cause I rant a lot.
Yeah.
It'd be your dream job.
You know, for a seventh floor
type, you got a big heart.
Too big, I'm told.
Listen to me,
to keep fighting the good fight
in this line of work,
you have to have a big heart
because it's constantly
being chipped away at.
See? Natural teacher.
I really will think it over.
It's ginger ale, by the way.
Oh. I'm glad. Do you mind if I have...
No. Knock yourself out.
I'll have a martini.
- Hi, Russell, come on in.
- Evening. I was on my way home.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Thought I'd give you the
inspiring news in person.
Well, you don't look inspired.
Unofficial whip count looks like
the spending bill with Brandt's rider
has the votes to override a veto.
We just met with the committee
members a few hours ago.
How can there already be a whip vote?
Amazing how fast Congress can move
when their own reelections
are at stake.
So I guess America's
gonna buy those planes,
whether we need them or not.
Oh, and word is your buddy
Jeff Pearson's a yes, too.
Well...
don't stand there looking all wounded,
like I just told you
the Easter Bunny's not real.
This is Washington, kids,
and I told you we weren't ready
for this fight.
If Congress jams that rider through,
China will hit back quickly.
They'll pull out of the
Fair Work and Trade Agreement.
They'll step up naval activity
in the Taiwan Strait.
Our hands are tied.
They won.
No company should get to dictate
to the United States government.
You know,
for a president who took some grief
about playing too much golf,
Eisenhower got a lot done.
The interstate highway system,
fighting for desegregation,
pushing back the Soviets.
But that famous speech about the...
military-industrial complex?
That was his final speech in office.
Do you think there
was a reason for that?
An effective president
gets two or three things done
that really move the country forward.
A truly excellent one, maybe four.
I think you'll be an excellent one.
Well, thank you, sir.
- But...
- The point is,
if you want to bring Fossor
and its ilk to heel, Godspeed.
Just be sure that that's
the most important thing to you
because there won't be
much room for anything else.
- Understood, sir.
- What's the word, Hank?
Mr. President, I wanted
to apprise you personally
of some developments
in the Fossor case.
Shoot.
Based on an anonymous tip, we've
uncovered a pattern at Fossor
of some very serious
public corruption,
including numerous
campaign finance violations.
What, the dark money
they already dump into campaigns,
but legally don't even have to report,
wasn't quite enough for them, huh?
How high up does the corruption go?
Thanks, Jose.
Lot of guys would be mad
they skulled that last shot,
but not me,
'cause what do I always say?
"Adversity is opportunity," sir.
That's right. Okay.
Hit the sand behind the ball.
Easy power, easy power.
Uh, sir...
- Sir.
- What, Jose?
James Champlin?
- I wouldn't know, either.
- Oh, Congressman Chivvers.
Congressman Faustino,
- Congresswoman Robertson.
Good to see you.
Guessing you just heard
about James Champlin's arrest.
That's quite a list of charges.
All those allegations of
campaign finance violations...
Who knows where that's gonna go.
We're not going to support
Brandt's rider, if that's
what you want to know.
Support among members is...
falling.
It's crashing back to Earth and
breaking up on reentry, Herb.
Well, you're the one that
twisted my arm, Susan.
We needed those jobs...
Well, thank you for this glimpse
into your deliberative process.
Waffles can stay with me
three days a week.
I know you mean well,
but this is actually
- really difficult...
- No. No, no, no.
Listen, I spoke to my landlord,
and he agreed to make
an exception in this case.
Why?
Because I'm a terrific tenant,
and he doesn't want to lose me,
and I might've also said that Waffles
is an emotional support dog.
That you only have part-time?
Mr. Manukian is old, okay?
It's possible he might not
have heard everything I said.
The point is, it worked.
Or it will, as long as Waffles...
wears this.
Come here.
- Who's good?
- I don't know if this is right.
Good. Think of it this way:
Waffles is emotionally supporting you
by staying with me
three days a week. All right.
Come here, baby.
Does that work?
I'm sorry I got so mad.
I'm sorry you had to.
Looks like he's the one who
needs the support.
I don't know. I feel better already.
How about you?
Yeah. Do you want to go home?
Thanks, man.
Thanks for agreeing to meet with me.
You were right, I don't totally
understand all the pressures
you're under as a congressman.
So you know, I was prepared to
vote "yes" on the Brandt rider.
Might not have been
the gutsiest vote I ever took,
but in any case, it's moot now.
Well, I just didn't want you to
think I was moralizing at you.
Not to worry.
You know something, Hank,
you always did see things
pretty clearly,
how they might play out.
You definitely clocked
this situation with Fossor
better than I did.
Until recently, anyway.
The anonymous source
that tipped off the DOJ...
Like you said, end of the day,
I'm still a Marine.
Oorah.
Bess.
Mr. President.
- Join us for a toast.
- Love to.
There you are.
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.
There's a lot to be proud of.
Yeah. James Champlin and Fossor
will have to answer
for their corruption in court,
the Fair Work and Trade
Agreement is back on track,
and we're only buying 80
F-40 fighters,
as we originally agreed.
Pretty good day's work, I'd say.
I'm sorry, excuse me?
The scandal brought Fossor
back to the table.
They agreed to eat the cost
of the additional 20 jets,
so we won't have to.
We got what we wanted. We won.
No, we won before,
when the contract
was cancelled altogether.
That would've left us with
no next-generation fighters
- in the pipeline.
- You said we could retrofit the YF-31.
Well, guess who revised
their budget estimates upward?
- The manufacturer of the YF-31.
- Yes.
But we had leverage.
Fossor's the devil
we know at this point.
Yes,
but they are still the devil,
and the F-40 is still
an overpriced albatross
and the whole system
needs to be changed. Sir...
We fought the world's largest
defense contractor to a draw.
With these people,
that's as close to a win
as you're gonna get.
- Now, can we drink, finally?
- Mm.
Actually, I'm already a little dizzy.
I think I'll say good night.
Thank you.
I told you before, Bess,
if you want to use up your presidency
fighting for that win,
be my guest.
You can count on it, sir.
Due respect, sir,
I would call this a win,
for you and the American people.
Because look it,
at the end of the day,
the F-40's an excellent plane.
