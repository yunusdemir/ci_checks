Chief! The president of the Martial
Artist Alliance, Mr. Yuan, is here.
Today's duel will decide
who'll be the new president.
There will be 10 rounds.
If you lose,
you'll have to cease
being outlaws forever.
If we win, I'll dominate over
the world of martial arts.
Chief Hong,
once again you will
see who is the best today.
Yuan Zeng, rein in your arrogance!
You may have beaten me once,
but today someone will finish you!

Lei Ben.
Yes, President.
Xiao Tian Hao is smart.
And his skill is also not bad.
Just a bit childish sometimes.
Line up the contestants!
But don't use our
best men in the beginning.
They might reserve some
deadly contestants for the end.
Yes!

Kuwada-san is a samurai.
President Yuan, please!
A Japanese samurai isn't
qualified to fight with our president.
Let me fight him!
<i>Fight Choreographers:
Chu Ke; Cheng Tien Sze</i>
When a fighter loses one strike,
it also means losing his life.
I lost! I have disgraced
the world of Chinese martial arts.
Don't listen to him!
You win some and you lose some!
Stay calm! All of you fought already!
My turn!
Zhi Sheng can do it!
Barehanded?
Yes, it doesn't matter how
many swords you use.
Good job!
Would you like to take it back,
or use another sword?
When a fighter loses one strike,
it also means losing his life!
Chinese martial artists are brave,
so are Japanese samurai.
I'll use another sword!
Please wait a moment.
Too: Mr. Kembuchi
Kembuchi-san is my good friend
and is exceptionally
skilled in the martial arts.
Send this invitation to him.
He'll surely come.
<i>Horned Ring</i>
This ring is a token of
my good friend Kembuchi-san,
who is the king of ninjas.
President Yuan,
when you see this ring again,
it will mean your doom!
<i>Headquarters of
the Martial Artist Alliance</i>
The formal letter
of challenge just arrived.
<i>The formal challenge letter
from Mr. Kembuchi</i>
<i>Five Elements Formation</i>
What is
the "Five Elements Formation"?
What does it say?
It says there are five battles;
metal, wood, water, fire and earth formations.
And where will these formations be?
Start with the metal element
formation first at noon tomorrow.
What's ninjitsu?
I don't know much either.
All I know is
it's a Japanese martial art.
Kembuchi Mudou?
Is he the so-called king of ninjas?
This is his token?
Beware!
It might be poisoned! Don't touch it!
I was not cautious last time,
and caught it
from that Japanese samurai.
My palm was pierced a little bit.
I thought it wouldn't hurt,
but in fact I was poisoned.
President, you were poisoned?
Yes. Now I need to use my inner
powers to control the poison.
And I can't fight
for at least three months.
So they'll use this chance
to challenge us now?
I believe so.
The worst thing is...
We don't know if the Five
Elements Foundation is real or not.
They might be deadly,
or perhaps it's a trap,
to lure our best men away.
Then they could attack
our headquarters!
What should we do?
Up till now, Zhi Sheng, Tian Hao,
Huang Han, and you have
been the best in kung fu.
And then He Fen, Bao Tong,
Tan Zheng Yong,
the Lin brothers, and Lin Muk.
Of the four best,
I want Zhi Sheng and Tian Hao
to guard our headquarters.
The remaining eight of you
will fight at the five battle formations.
Understood.
If the formation is a hoax,
return immediately.
If not,
the formations will
get deadlier and deadlier.
Bao Tong and
Tan Zheng Yong both use swords.
They can be the pair
to take the first formation.
He Fen will take the second,
with Lin Mu as support.
The Lin brothers will take
the third with their spears.
Lei Ben and Huang Han
will handle the remaining two.
Yes!
<i>Headquarters of
the Martial Artist Alliance</i>
Brothers, guard this place well!
No need to see me off!
Yes!
Yes!
Brother Lei, you have to be careful too.
Brother Lei, you have to be careful too.
Tian Hao, what do you think
of their chances this time?
With their kung fu,
they should be able to deal
with the "Five Elements Formation."
The only disadvantage,
is we know nothing about ninjitsu.
I think so too.
But as they know
the president is poisoned,
they might use tricks
to create a diversion.
Now most of our best men
have gone to the formations.
Not many skilled
brothers are on guard here now.
Tian Hao, you and I have
a great responsibility now.
Tian Hao, you stay in this room
to protect our president.
Be well aware of
any movements outside.
But if anything happens
out there, let me handle it!
You should never
leave the president alone.
I got it!
President, Lei Ben has
proceeded on the journey.
Tian Hao and I have laid
most of our defense.
Good! Be careful!
Yes, sir!
<i>Metal</i>
<i>Metal</i>
Metal element.
There it is.
<i>Copper Hats</i>
<i>Wood</i>
It's the wood element formation!
Keep your eyes open!
<i>Dart</i>
How come I don't see anyone?
He Fen, your abdomen!
I was ambushed!
Lin Muk!
<i>Hand Claws</i>
<i>Iron Fist</i>
<i>Hand Claws</i>
<i>Sword of the Woods</i>
<i>Tekko-kagi<i>
<i>Water</i>
<i>Water Spiders</i>
Shoot the darts!
That's it?
Was it the water element formation?
I guess so.
Using "water" to escape!
<i>Sickle</i>
<i>Fire</i>
This must be
the fire element formation.
Show yourself!
<i>Back Somersault</i>
<i>Donohi</i>
Heroes don't ambush people!
Try again if you dare!
<i>Shinobi</i>
<i>Sword
Chen Hui Min</i>
<i>Ninja leader, Kembuchi Mudou.</i>
May I have your name?
I was ambushed by you!
I will haunt you for eternity.
You are lower than a cockroach.
How dare you ask for my name!
<i>Earth</i>
<i>Chao Kuo</i>
Earth element.
<i>Hooked Sickle</i>
<i>Naginata<i>
Another hero died!
Who are they?
Who are they?
Huang Han's intestines are falling out!
He Fen!
Lin Muk!
Bao Tong!
Tan Zheng Yong!
Lin Yan He, Lin Yan Yi!
Could it be... Brother Lei?
It's Lei Ben!
How could this happen?
How could this be?
Brother Zhi Sheng!
Brother Zhi Sheng...
Ninjitsu is really deadly.
Eight young heroes of the alliance
were killed in one sweep!
Master Kembuchi,
where are your men?
Why don't you invite them in?
Chief Hong!
Though the Five Element Formation
exterminated eight top fighters,
the Martial Artist Alliance still exists.
Yuan Zeng was poisoned
by my ring so he can't fight now.
As I heard, he can cure
himself with his inner power.
He will recuperate in three months.
If we don't root them out this time,
there will be
more trouble in the future.
If Master Kembuchi
and your samurai
can help us again,
I will deeply appreciate it.
My sources however tell me that,
because Yuan Zeng is recuperating,
their headquarters is heavily guarded.
Despite more security, ninjas can
still break into his stronghold.
Bamboo Strips
Junko!
<i>Chen Pei Chien</i>
<i>Headquarters of
the Martial Artist Alliance</i>
Halt! Stop there!
Brother Zhi Sheng,
it's none of our business.
I can't just sit back and do nothing.
Don't be afraid.
Everything's okay now.
Thank you for
saving me and taking me in.
Who said anything
about taking you in?
Ah Shun,
you should understand one thing:
Unless you hide here forever,
I will find you again
and break your legs!
Then we'll see
if you can run away again!
Hero, did you hear...
You're gonna be fine.
He's just bluffing and making
himself feel better at the same time.
What's with you?
My name is Ah Shun and
my parents died when I was a kid.
That man is my uncle.
He tried to sell me
to a brothel many times.
Every time I tried to escape,
he'd beat me up.
Just now he said...
I heard it!
Tian Hao, what do you think?
We have enough
trouble on our hands.
It's better not to be a hero this time.
That means... we'll let her fall back
to the scoundrel's hands again?
We must guard
our base securely anyway,
and keeping her
wouldn't compromise this.
Enough trouble already!
Now another problem!
All right, stop crying!
This is so disturbing!
He's my big brother,
and he'd like to take you in.
So I must listen to him!
Master Xiao!
Need my help?
No! And you don't know how anyway!
You're right!
Guess I just said that to please you.
Typical!
All the same!
Master Liang!
Thank you!
What a waste to pluck the flowers!
He's still childish. Don't mind him.
Little troublemaker! Come here!
What have you done?
What did you do to my room?
I just tidied it up a bit.
My things were
in their proper places.
Now I can't find them.
What are you looking for?
What am I looking for?
Where's my spear?
Behind the cupboard.
Why did you hide my spear?
Do you want the ninjas
to kill me when I'm unarmed?
You are a spy sent by the ninjas!
Why were you frightening her?
Don't ever touch my stuff again!
I will bring it in!
Let me test it first!
I'll get a new one! Be back soon!
You are too cautious!
Better to be careful than sorry.
I'll take it in.
Okay!
You may leave!
Yes!
Who is that girl?
I saw her being
beaten a few days ago.
Upon asking, I found out
she'd been bullied by her uncle,
who attempted
to sell her as a prostitute.
I took pity on her,
so I took her in for a few days.
We have enough trouble on our hands.
Don't poke your nose
into other people's business.
Yes!
I need to make my rounds.
Master Xiao!
You haven't given me
any trouble in the past two days.
<i>Leaf-hat</i>
Your leaf-hat is very nice.
Let me have a look at it.
Let me see!
Leave her alone!
Go and make your rounds!
Girls are so delicate!
Only a little bit of sun
and they need a hat.
<i>Arrows inside the hat</i>
<i>Bow</i>
Junko made it.
Here's the blueprint of
the headquarters' defenses.
Great!
We have to launch an attack tonight.
Who is it?
What are you doing here?
What kind of clothing is that?
You saved me and
have been so nice to me.
I don't know how I can repay you
Except...
Except offering myself to you.
Don't say that.
You'd better leave now.
Master Liang, don't you like me?
Yes, but now's not the time.
You have nowhere to go,
and I let you stay here.
I can't take advantage of you.
It's not what a hero should do.
Master Liang,
you are truly a gentleman.
Stay here longer
and think it over carefully.
Wait till all our troubles
have been settled.
By then if you still like me,
we can inform the president and,
discuss with him
any thoughts about our marriage.
We can't take it so lightly.
But I don't deserve you.
Don't say that!
It's late.
You'd better go back to your room.
Please let me play
the vertical bamboo flute for you.
In your room.
All right.
Again?

I have to go!
Find a place in the room to hide!
Don't go out!
<i>Blowing Dart</i>
Ah Shun, you...
My Japanese name is Junko.
<i>Sword in the Flowers</i>
Attack!
The president!
They are going around back!
Ah Shun did this to me.
She said she is called Junko.
She's Japanese? A female ninja?
Zhi Sheng,
I give my word to avenge you!
Don't bother with this now!
Save the president first!
That's right! Hang on! I'm going!
<i>Chain Sickle</i>
Don't kill him! Tie him up in the room.
I'll need him later!
Use the locking tool!
<i>Locking tool</i>
Use firing arrows!
<i>Firing Arrow<i>
President!
Who are you, kiddo?
Why are you here?
I am Xiao Tian Hao,
I am going to the headquarters
of the Martial Artist Alliance.
May I have your name, sir?
If I have offended you,
please forgive me.
I am Yang Tung Fei.
You're here by accident. It's destiny.
I'll teach you
a Japanese unlashing technique.
If you can acquire this skill,
you can untie yourself.
If not,
there's no point letting
you go to the Alliance.
And you can just hang there.
Master Yang called
this technique "Fallen Petals."
The technique to untie it is...
Guard here!
Xiao Tian Hao, are you ignoring me?
You used to call me "Master Xiao."
You ignore me because I don't
address you as "Master" anymore?
That's not the point.
I only know Ah Shun,
whom I used to
call "little troublemaker."
But I don't know Junko,
who is the female ninja.
Now the "little troublemaker"
becomes the "big troublemaker."
Xiao Tian Hao,
you've been treating me harshly.
What's the point of
being good to you?
Liang Zhi Sheng treated you well,
but you killed him.
Indeed Liang Zhi Sheng
was a nice man,
unfortunately...
Therefore it's better
not to be a nice man.
Now it's my turn
to be a nice person.
I just saved you
from being killed by them.
But it looks like
you don't appreciate it much.
Why is it nice people are never liked?
Liang Zhi Sheng was
much better than you are.
But you are the one
I always had feelings for.
Don't you have feelings for me at all?
Surprise!
I know your ninja technique too!
This is called
the unlashing technique, isn't it?
I swore to avenge Liang Zhi Sheng!
I can kill you now,
but I have to avenge the president
and the others who were killed.
I don't even want to die with you here.
May I trouble you to see me out?
Junko, how could you be so stupid?
If not for your help
in destroying the alliance,
you'd be put to death
according to the ninja rules.
You're now sentenced
to six months hard labor.
Master, you're amazing!
Yuan Zeng is dead!
The alliance is totally destroyed!
That's correct!
May I know when you will go back?
I've prepared rich gifts for you!
I'm not planning to go back!
I've conquered
the Chinese martial arts world!
Such an accomplishment.
Why should I go back?
You mean...
What I mean is
I want to take over your seat!
<i>The prestige shakes the woold</i>
Why are you here again?
Master Yang, thanks for teaching me
the unlashing technique last time.
The alliance has been
destroyed by ninjas.
I'm here to beg you to be
my teacher and teach me ninjitsu.
<i>Wong Li</i>
This is your big brother, Li Ying Wu.
Chu Ke
This is your second brother, Chen Jun.
This is your third brother, Huang Fa.
<i>The Best Capturing Weaponry
of Southern Barbarians<i>
Catch it!
Listen to the sound of my cane,
and use what you've
got in hand to block it.
Ninjitsu originated from
Chinese kung fu in ancient times.
Then later it spread
to Japan and became ninjitsu.
Those ninjas were amazing.
They appeared
and disappeared mysteriously.
There's also
the Five Elements Formation.
We sent out eight kung fu experts
but none came back alive.
Don't know why it is so deadly.
Indeed, this martial skill is mysterious.
The unlashing technique
I taught you is one of them.
It originated from
the magical art of the Taoists.
During the period
of the Three Kingdoms,
this kind of kung fu
was already very popular.
During the Three Kingdoms period,
Zuo Zhi used this technique
to make fun of Cao Cao.
You may also say that
Zuo Zhi was an expert in ninjitsu.
In fact, my kung fu is
inherited from Master Zuo.
Then you know
everything about ninjitsu?
The Five Elements Formation includes,
metal, wood, water,
fire, and earth elements.
Master Zuo Zhi's martial skills,
spread back to Japan.
So years ago,
I tried very hard to go to Japan,
and learned the essential
part of this technique.
If not fully prepared for
the Five Elements Formation,
one would still die
no matter how good his kung fu is.
Master!
Master!
Tomorrow you will challenge
the Five Elements Formation.
Why didn't you rest early?
I couldn't sleep, so I dragged
the brothers into a chat.
You experienced abrupt changes;
no one would blame you
for bearing all these grudges.
You all know how
to destroy the Formation well.
Although ninja weapons could
come in many different forms,
they can all be categorized
into throwing, hitting,
grasping, and shackling.
I've explained very clearly to you all,
so you wouldn't be taken by surprise.
Master, what's this?
This is what I got in Japan
from a ninja years ago.
I don't know what it is used for either.
Maybe it's something
to do with shackling.
Ninjas have a lot of secret techniques.
Kembuchi called himself
the king of ninjas.
At times I wonder what deadly
techniques he's acquired.
Tian Hao, take it with you.
You might need it.
Yes!
What? Some men from
the alliance still survived?
Correct!
Today there's only me, Xiao Tian Hao!
But there'll be more in the future!
Last time you sent
a challenge to the alliance.
Now here is one for you!
My three other brothers and I are
ready to fight the formation again.
Xiao Tian Hao?
You were the only one who escaped.
Do you know
how many Chinese martial artists,
died in this formation so far?
As a member of the alliance,
naturally I'd know of the happenings
in the martial arts world.
I know that
there are altogether 153 people,
who were sacrificed
in fighting the formation.
Well, you do have guts!
Aren't you afraid we'll detain you?
I still have three other brothers
who can break this formation.
Well. All right.
I'll be waiting for you noon tomorrow!
We will be here on time.
Junko, come here!
Why didn't you detain him?
Many tried to
break the formation before,
but no one survived!
He knows this, and he luckily
managed to escape last time,
yet he still dares to issue the challenge!
He must have strong backup!
He has brothers,
which means there must be a school.
Since we want to rule
the Chinese martial arts world,
we have to find
this out and kill them all.
Junko!
Yes!
He just left! Follow him now and,
find out which school he belongs to.
Who is his master?
And how skilled
are his three brothers?
Also, try to learn how they
intend to break the formation.
If you succeed,
you'll be spared from hard labor.
If you still have feelings for him and,
do foolish things like last time,
you should be well aware
of the rules of the ninja.
Yes!
Go!
Yes!
Junko is not reliable.
Follow her.
Yes!
Xiao Tian Hao,
when did you realize I was here?
Haven't you been
following me all this time?
Fine! You are smart!
You don't even look at me.
I've seen enough.
Aren't you afraid
I'll attack you from behind?
You can try!
Xiao Tian Hao, don't you realize that,
last time I let you
escape from the alliance,
and I've been
punished by Kembuchi?
In regard to falling into my trap,
I guess you deserve it.
Am I supposed
to thank you or apologize?
If not for the fact that
I like you and care about you,
you wouldn't have had
the chance to escape.
You would have been killed long ago.
Despite suffering so much for you,
I still have to hear this?
What do you want to hear?
Thank you?
Tian Hao, I still care about you.
Tell me,
where have you been these days?
Who taught you kung fu?
Who are your brothers?
How are you going
to break the formation?
Maybe I could help you find out,
your odds of winning.
You followed me because of this?
If you get all this information,
Kembuchi will spare you
from hard labor, right?
Xiao Tian Hao!
Am I right?
How heartless you are!
I tried to be good to you,
care about you, and help you.
But you don't trust me at all.
All right! I trust you!
Come.
Sit down.
Better if you lie down.
It's quiet here.
And the moon is bright.
I knew that you would like me.
You're right. I like you.
Is this nice enough?
Xiao Tian Hao,
you still don't trust me!
I almost believed what you said.
But I found out you have
brought four men with you.
So I thought I should
avenge Liang Zhi Sheng instead.
Brought four men?
Not at all!
I don't know anything about it.
But this is what it's all about!
You lied to me just now!
This is your way!
Before you killed Liang Zhi Sheng,
you were in his bed, right?
Xiao Tian Hao!
I didn't do anything wrong!
Didn't I do anything wrong?
<i>Metal</i>
<i>Wood</i>
<i>Wood</i>
Be careful!
<i>Water</i>
<i>Fire</i>

<i>Earth</i>
Brothers, be careful!
It's Kembuchi Mudou!
I'll go first, and then you guys follow.
We'll take turns
attacking him continuously.
This is not a chivalrous.
We are...
Don't be fussy!
Revenge is our priority.
Let's attack him together!
<i>Unbreakable Shackle</i>
Master's key!
It's here! You dropped it
at the fire element formation.
Luckily I picked it up!
Hurry and try it!
Tian Hao, why did you do that?
I don't know myself.
Maybe I'm desperate for revenge!
Or perhaps I've been
obsessed by Junko's spirit.
Sorry!
