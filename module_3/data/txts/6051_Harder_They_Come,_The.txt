You have any more?</i>
- Taking this for my mother.
- Put it up.

Hey, country boy, move!
Wait a minute, man.
You know the way to Milk Lane?
You have money?
If you have money, go anywhere at all.
But if you don't have money,
you're fucked. Better you stay at home.
<i>- All right, how much?
- Give me 50 cents and help me push.</i>
Hey, it's a red light.
That means stop.
That's why country boys,
they get killed.
<i>Did you hear that
Express yourself</i>
Hey, Winston!
You know that bitch
owes me money.
Hey, give me back my money!
Go after him. Go after him.
Hey, the guy over there
sent me for his money.
He say you have the money, man.
Where's the guy now?
<i>Bye, bye, bye
Good gracious</i>
<i>Stop that train
I want to get off</i>
Hey, come back here, man!
Give me my things, man!
Come back here, man!
<i>Stop that train</i>
<i>- I want to get off
- Where you goin', man? Where you goin'?</i>
<i>Goodness gracious</i>
What's that?
How much you have?
Two. Owe this to your partner.
You know if this lady
live around here?
Oh, over there.
- My play?
- Yeah.
Let me draw!
Ivan.
All right, come inside.
- You sick, Momma?
- Yes.
I wonder your grandmother when you
leave. What you come to town for?
Grandma dead.
Dead? How she can be
and I never knew?
We tried to get you,
but the telegram came back.
- And when she going to bury?
- She buried already, Momma.
<i>Bury already? Buried already,
and I never got to go to the funeral?</i>
<i>Oh, God! Oh, God!</i>
Don't cry. Don't cry.
<i>Don't you cry.</i>
<i>Oh, God.</i>
And what happened to the place?
Grandma sold the place
before she died.
And what happened to the money?
She said she wanted a big funeral.
And she took all the money for her big
funeral, and I didn't even get to go?
Then the money finished?
A little bit left.
Well, don't you have it?
Yes, I do.
<i>- It's all that is left?
- Yes.</i>
Then how are you gonna get
back to country tonight?
I'm not going back.
<i>Then where are you going? You can't
stay here, because I can't help you.</i>
- I'm staying in town.
- You think town is easy? How you gonna live?
I could make a record.
I can sing, you know, Momma.
You take this thing for a joke?
Well, I can get a job, then.
What kind of job you can get,
other than a criminal?
Why you say a thing like that?
Why you say a thing like that about me?
Don't ask me any questions.
Go back to country.
All right.
Since you're determined,
I will give you the name of a person
who will try and help you.
If you behave yourself,
he may try and get a local job for you.
See it here?
- Preacher?
- Yes.
Him can help you.
Okay, Momma.
And you didn't even bring me
a mango from country?
Mango season was bad this year.
I've got three on this.
- Where's... Which four is that?
- Yeah.
One blank, down there so.
Did you find Daisy?
Yeah.
You just come from the country?
Yes.
- You pass?
- Yeah, your play.
Five.
Your old lady?
So you sell your land in country
and come back to town?
Can call it that.
So you mean.
So you mean.
Your play, man! Don't laugh, boy.
<i>I don't wanna play another game until you
pay me that 50 cents. You owe me too much now.</i>
I can't pay you
till tomorrow, you know.
Too much action around town for me
to play with people who cannot pay.
What's showing at Rialto?
What do you know about Rialto,
just come from country?
I read about it, man.
- So you want to go to Rialto?
- Yes.
- Come then, now.
- I come with you?
<i>Yes, man.</i>
Shut your mouth! The hero
can't die until the last reel.
Him think hero can't die
until the last reel.
<i>Shoot them! Come on!</i>
I ask you, you know?
I ask you to try beginner's luck.
<i>Get your hits from Hilton's.</i>
<i>See Hilton's for records,
record players,</i>
<i>radios, musical instruments,</i>
<i>and every sound around
from beat to Bach and back.</i>
<i>Hilton's has everything in music.</i>
Hilton!
Mr. Hilton!
<i>Mr. Hilton!</i>
Mr. Hilton. Mr. Hilton.
Mr. Hilton.
From morning, we've been here waiting
for you. From 11:00, we've been here.
- What about?
- Mr. Kenton sent me.
- Oh. You have a tune?
- I have a tune, yes.
Sing it for me, then.
We are all one big brother
All belong to one father
You tread on one
you hurt another
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
<i>We were fresh and perfect, see</i>
Made to live in unity
Let peace be your motto...
Uh, that's all right, all right.
I can't use it. Too slow.
<i>- Where you used to work?
- Morrison.</i>
<i>- What kind of work you do?
- Carpenter work.</i>
All right,
go and see Mr. Jackson.
<i>Next. What can you do?</i>
- I can do anything you want, sir.
- Can you pour concrete?
- You can do carpentry work?
- I never did it before...
- You can be a mason? You can paint?
- I can do it, you know?
- Just give me a break.
- What do you mean? "Give me a break. "
- We want skilled people.
- Just give me a break.
Give you a break?
Leave the place, man.
Next.
<i>You again? Didn't I
run you yesterday? Leave, man.</i>
<i>- Leave the place.
- I can work as well as the next man, sir.</i>
<i>Leave the place.</i>
<i>Many rivers to cross</i>
<i>But I can't seem to find</i>
<i>- My way over
- How do you do?</i>
- What are you doing there?
- I'm looking for work.
I don't have any work to give you.
I could wash your car,
you know, ma'am.
My husband gets the car
washed downtown.
I could do your gardening.
Look, we have a gardening
service to do that.
I can do anything,
you know, ma'am. Anything.
Look, there's nothing you can do
for me. Nothing you can do for me.
Beg you for ten cents then, ma'am.
What's the matter
with you young, healthy boys?
All you know to do
is beg, beg, beg.
That's all you can do,
just beg?
<i>- How you got in here, anyway?
- The gate was open, ma'am.</i>
<i>Well, when you go outside, you
make sure you lock the gate behind you.</i>
Who left the gate open?
<i>Wandering, I am lost</i>
<i>As I travel along</i>
<i>The White Cliffs of Dover</i>
<i>Many rivers to cross</i>
<i>And it's only my will</i>
<i>That keeps me alive</i>
<i>I've been licked
washed up for years</i>
<i>And I merely survived</i>
<i>Because of my pride</i>
<i>And this loneliness
won't leave me alone</i>
<i>It's such a drag
to be on your own</i>
<i>My woman left
and she didn't say why</i>
<i>And I guess I'll have to cry</i>
<i>- Many rivers to cross
- Rivers to cross</i>
<i>But just where to begin</i>
<i>I play for time</i>
<i>- There'll be times
- Many</i>
<i>- I find myself
- Rivers to cross</i>
<i>Thinking of...</i>
You got ten cents, master? I was
watching your car while you was away.
- No, man. The steward always look after my car, man.
- He's not here all the time.
If you want the ten cents,
go beg the steward.
All right.
What you doing here?
Get out, man. Get out.
Get out, man!
Get outta here.
Just a closer walk with Thee
Grant it, Jesus, is my plea
Daily walking
- Close to Thee
- Close to Thee
Let it be, Dear Lord
Let it be
Just a closer walk with Thee
Closer walk with Thee
Love me, Jesus
<i>- Is my plea
- Is my plea</i>
<i>Daily walking</i>
- Close to Thee
- Close to Thee
<i>Let it be, Dear Lord</i>
Let it be
- Morning, Longa.
- Morning, Preacher.
- Morning, young man.
- Morning, Preacher.
- How're you gettin' along?
- Not too bad, sir.
I'll be back in a while.
Hey, pretty boy.
Pretty hat.
Johnny Too Bad.
Bring me the hammer.
What, you can't
get it yourself?
No, man.
You bring it for me.
You have on pretty hat
this morning.
You like it?
You really look
like Johnny Too Bad.
You only need a gun
to look like Johnny.
But before you get a gun,
get the broom and come
sweep out the shop.
I look like a preacher
right now?
Get the broom and sweep out the shop.
You are a little boy.
Hi. What happening?
Can't see you.
You don't want to see me. What happened
to you at choir practice last night?
What happened?
Did you miss me?
Personally, no.
But crusades start next week,
and Preacher's asking for you.
Why are you calling him Preacher?
Don't he's your father?
- No.
- Oh.
Why you say it like that?
Nothing.
He's my guardian,
ever since my father and mother died.
That's why he's
so strict with you.
It's for my own good.
Excuse me.
- Who this bicycle frame belong to?
- Preacher.
- You think he'd want it?
- Don't have no use.
I can fix it up.
Maybe you and I could go for a ride.
I don't think so, you know?
<i>Just a ride.</i>
- Perhaps. Depends.
- Depends on what?
If you're a true Christian.
The rest of boys too rude.
Some Christians rude too.
I don't know about that.
<i>El numero uno has arrived!</i>
I know you're playing
in Preacher's garden.
You know, Preacher tend that little
cherry tree for a long time now.
When fruit ripe,
if Preacher don't pick it,
I feel I will pick it.
Look like it's ripe too.
"Consider the lilies
of the field, how they grow.
<i>"They toil not,
neither do they spin.</i>
"And yet I say unto you,
that even Solomon in all his glory...
"was unarrayed like one of these.
<i>"Wherefore, if God so clothed
the grass of the field,</i>
<i>"which today is, and tomorrow
is cast into the oven,</i>
"shall He not much more clothe you,
<i>O ye of little faith?"</i>
<i>Brothers and sisters,
before you leave,</i>
I'd like to inform you
that you won't be able...
<i>to pick up your records
for the rally today.</i>
<i>The master record
has not arrived from America.</i>
<i>I'll let you know about that
during the course of the week.</i>
Now let us stand
and sing and praise.
Be guided
poor lost sinner
Before the Lord inform
And in the name of Jesus
A pardon He'll perform
He heard Thy supplication
And soon the weak were strong
For Jesus took my burden
And left me with a song
Yes, Jesus took my burden
I could not help Him bear
Yes, Jesus took my burden
He answered to my prayer
He answers prayers I'm certain
My spirit was made strong
For Jesus took my burden
And left me with a song
<i>Who turned off...</i>
I did. You're gonna make the Lord
come back and find you doing this?
<i>- Doing what, Preacher? - Boogie-woogie
and twistin' up yourself in my yard.</i>
They don't have boogie-woogie
anymore, Preacher.
I don't care what you want to call it!
I don't want it in my yard.
All right, Preacher.
I'm finished for the night, sir.
And furthermore, what are you
doing here at this time of night?
- I was fixing the bicycle.
- Fixing your bicycle?
You should be reading your Bible.
Reading your Bible!
You hear what I tell you?
Reading your Bible three times a day!
- All right.
- Don't walk away from me. You're impertinent!
<i>- You're rude! Don't have respect!
- Preacher on the warpath tonight.</i>
- I wonder why.
- Must've noticed what we noticed.
What has Preacher
got to do with that?
Preacher is a man
of the Lord, but still...
He is a man, all the same.
And the Lord say,
"Go ye forth and multiply,"
and Preacher don't multiply yet.
Preacher has been my guardian,
and he will always
be my guardian, and that's that.
- When nothing else could help...
- Yes!
- Then love came down!
- Amen!
It rescued the perishing!
Cared for the dying!
Snatched us from iniquity!
Raise us from the grave!
Tonight, here is love!
Praise God!
- We say it is a gift of God!
- Amen!
Amen! Tonight,
the wages of sin is coming!
It's death!
It's damnation!
It's derogation!
But here is the love of God!
<i>- Here!
- Love worketh no end!</i>
Love thinketh no evil!
Love never fails to accept,
not even if provoked!
Praise God!
Let us give thanks to Jesus!
- Thank you, Jesus!
- Let's alleluia!
- Alleluia! Alleluia!
- Let's praise Him!
- Longa?
- Yes, Preacher?
- Where is that boy?
- I don't know, Preacher. He might be in his automobile.
His automobile, huh?
And where have you been?
I just been for a ride, sir.
You've been skylarking,
and I can't find you?
All I can find is this
nastiness in the place.
And you get into the house.
Do you know how long
we've been waiting for this?
If we don't get to the studio,
we won't have any records for the rally.
- I can take it right now.
- By the time you get there, it will be closed.
I can take it down
right now, sir.
And be sure you come back
in a hurry.
Auntie in her room cry
My mama said she must wipe her eye
Mama's such a lovely fool in life
She never been to school

No wonder
he's a perfect partner
While they were dancing

Just a little rumor, friends
My uncle say he must work her in
And he's such a lovely
a fool in life
It's not time for his wedding day
It's no wonder
he's a perfect partner
While they were dancing
in that ballroom last night
One more day for the wedding cake
And 20 bottles of cola wine
All the people
them dress up in the white
<i>Because he don't stop at anything</i>
<i>No wonder he's a perfect partner</i>

Put him on a separate track.</i>
<i>- And what do you want?
- Bring the records for the rally, sir.</i>
I can sing too, sir.
I'd like the chance to make a record.
<i>Everybody want to make a record.
You almost ready there?</i>
<i>But I have a boss song.
This one must sell.</i>
- What time is the audition?
- Tomorrow.
- Okay, let's go.
- What time tomorrow?
- Tomorrow. We're ready.

- Fantastic news! Fantastic news!
- What happened?
- You remember the man Hilton I was trying to see?
- Yeah.
Saw him today.
He said I can record tomorrow.
- Great!
- Well, I want you to help me out.
- Yes.
- Will you lend me the key to go in the church?
You must be mad.
You want Preacher kill me?
Him don't have to know.
Can turn that amplifier down.
- No, Ivan.
- Why not?
- I just can't do it.
- If it wasn't for Preacher, I know you'd do it.
That sort of music
can't play in church, Ivan.
If Preacher catch me,
my life finished.
Life finished with him,
but started with me.
What do you mean?
When this song hits, you know
what it mean for me and you?
This is my big chance.
This is what we waiting for
ever since I come to town.
Nothing can stop me now,
you know?
I don't have to worry no more.
We'll have this song hit for you and me.
He won't let it, Ivan.
You're not gonna live
in Preacher's house all your life.
You're not gonna live with him
as man and wife.
You're a big girl now.
You're not a child anymore.
You have to make up your mind...
between me and Preacher.
Where's the song?
I have the words
in my back pocket.
Art outside.
Him listen to reason already.
I'm trusting you, Ivan.
All right.
One, two...
one, two, three, four.
Tell me about pie up in the sky
Waiting for me when I die
Yes.
And as sure as the sun
will shine up...
What are you doing in my church
at this time of night?
And playing all this kind
of music in my church!
I will call the police to have you
arrested for breaking into my church!
<i>- We had a key, you know, Preacher.
- A key?</i>
- You gave him the key to my church?
- Yes.
- Why?
- I had to give it to him.
<i>- What else did you give to him?
- Nothing.</i>
<i>- I gave him nothing!
- You're lying!</i>
No!
- You've been fornicating with him!
- No!
<i>- You gave him your lips. You gave him your body.
- No, no!</i>
<i>- Look at you!
- No! No!</i>
Hi. I hear you resigned your post, man.
What are you doing here?
- I come for my bicycle.
- Which bicycle?
That same one.
This bicycle is yours?
Since when?
Where you buy it from?
I didn't have to buy it. I see it
throwed in back. Nobody claim it.
- This is Preacher's bicycle. Preacher's premises.
- Well, I fixed it up.
Who told you to fix it? I'm grateful,
because Preacher give it to me.
It took me three weeks
to fix the bicycle, Longa.
I paid $6 for the wheels alone.
That is your bad luck.
Don't joke with your life, Longa.
Give me my bicycle.
<i>If it is your bicycle,
take it, man.</i>
Him cut me!
You want dead?
I will kill you.
Don't... fuck... with... me.
<i>You've had every chance to make good.</i>
<i>You've been
taken into the church...</i>
<i>and given a chance to lead
a good Christian life.</i>
<i>And instead of that, you've gone
and filled your head...</i>
<i>with foolishness and violence.</i>
<i>Since this is
your first offense,</i>
<i>I'm not going
to send you to jail.</i>
<i>I'm going to give you a chance
to come to your senses.</i>
<i>Either it will bring you
down to earth once and for all,</i>
<i>or there's little hope for you.</i>
<i>Eight strokes
of the tamarind switch.</i>
Well, you tell me
about pie up in the sky
Waiting for me when I die
But between the day you're
born and when you die
Never seem to hear even your cry
<i>So as sure as the sun will shine</i>
I'm gonna get my share, what's mine
And then the harder they come
The harder they'll fall
One and all
<i>The harder they come</i>
The harder they'll fall
One and all
Well, the oppressors
are trying to keep me down
Making me feel like a clown
And they think that
they have got me on the run
I say "Forgive them, Lord
they know not what they've done"
'Cause as sure
as the sun will shine
I'm gonna get my share now
What's mine
And then the harder they come
The harder they'll fall
One and all
Harder they come
the harder they'll fall
One and all
Oh, yeah
And they think that
they have got me on the run
Tell them that they don't
It ain't no fun
And I'd rather die
than live and be a slave
Yes, I'd rather be
right in my grave
So as sure as the sun will shine
I'm gonna get my share right now
What's mine
And then the harder they come
the harder they'll fall
One and all
Ooh, the harder they come
the harder they'll fall
One and all
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Harder they come
The harder they'll fall
One and all
What I say one time
Sometime, sometime I feel
The harder, mmm
One more time
One more time, yeah
One more time now, uh
All right, that's enough.
That song all right.
I think we can use it.
- When it going to be released, huh?
- Read this first.
What's the meaning of this?
That means you get
$20 for the record.
Twenty dollars, sir?
That don't sound right.
<i>- How much do you think it's worth, then?
- I don't really know, sir.</i>
Come on, you must have an idea.
What do you think it's worth?
Well, I think at least
about $200, you know, sir.
I don't think I'm signing this
for $20, you know, sir.
I see. Looks like
you have a new producer.
I wish you luck.
<i>- Numero Uno!
- Hi, brother. How are you doing?</i>
Not bad, you know. I have this record
I'd like you to play for me.
Let me have a look.
Hey, you're on a Hilton's label.
No, well, I used his studio.
I like the sound.
I see. But, well,
I deal directly Hilton's, man.
But this is my personal
record, you know.
This is personal.
I'm an independent producer as well.
Well, like I said,
I deal with Hilton's direct.
You know, this is show business, baby.
No business, no show.
<i>The oppressors
are trying to keep me down</i>
<i>Making me feel like a clown</i>
<i>- No, man, you're joking.
What I gonna do with this?</i>
After Hilton cut me off,
you gonna supply me?
Hilton don't want this thing.
Take it back, son.
Every day you say you're gonna sell the
record, but you can't without Hilton.
We've waited long enough, man.
I want the money now.
<i>I'm gonna get my share now
What's mine</i>
<i>And then the harder they come
the harder they'll fall</i>
<i>One and all</i>
<i>- Mr. Hilton.
- What do you want now?</i>
- To make another record?
- Not exactly, no, sir.
<i>- What do you want, then?
- I want the money.</i>
Which money? Which money?
Talk quick. Which money?
You'll take the $20?
Yes, I'll settle for that.
You're damn right
you'll settle for that.
I don't even particularly want
to do business with you anyway.
<i>- What do you say your name is?
- Ivanhoe Martin.</i>
Ivanhoe what?
Martin.
Here. Sign here.
And remember...
next time you cut a record,
you see, sport,
that I control this business.
<i>Understand? Okay?
And remember something else.</i>
I make hits, not the public.
I tell the DJs what to play.
Understand?
What do all of you want?
Ivanhoe no pay any of you yet?
But Ivan's
supposed to pay you now.
I not supposed to give you money.
Anyhow, come.
And let this be
a lesson to you, see?
Learn something
from this next time.
Remember that fellow that wouldn't sign
the contract? You can release it.
- Him sign now?
- Yep, but don't push it.
Tell the DJs I just want
to make back my money, okay?
- But, sir, it's a good record, you know.
- I know, I know.
But he's a troublemaker.
I don't want anything to do with him.
I don't want
to build him up, okay?
- What happened, son?
- Trouble, sir.
- What kind of trouble?
- Them shot Pedro's wife Nicole this evening.
<i>- Who shot her?
- Army, sir.</i>
- She had grass on her.
- Pedro got away with that.
- All right, leave it to me.
- What I must tell the trader?
They will just have to hold off
for a couple of days, Jose.
- But the traders pay protection...
- Leave it to me.
Traders pay protection money,
and one of them got shot.
Tell them not to get frightened. Just cool
it for a couple of days and leave it to me.
<i>- What about Pedro's wife?
- You organize that.</i>
Find somebody to take her place,
all right? Check with me later.
I have to go now, but you
check me at the police station.
All right.
Hello. Get me the commissioner of
police. Detective Ray Jones calling.
Hello, Commissioner.
Yes, sir.
The army went in today and shot
one of my people's women.
<i>- They're doing a series of raids.
- I know, but nobody told me!</i>
<i>- Who did they kill?
- An informer in the ganja trade.</i>
They can't be concerned
with who is an informer.
Well, I am concerned.
How can I control
crime in my area...
if the people giving me information
can't operate freely?
Look, I know you use the trade
as a form of control,
but I can't explain that
officially.
All I can do is ask
the army to cooperate.
Would you please explain that if anybody
controls what comes into town, it's me?
Rupert, your mother dead.
She can't help you.
Come. Come, let's go home.
Hi, baby.
Get any work today?
Big night tonight, you know.
Look what I buy you.
<i>Ivan, you mean you take your money
and you buy that?</i>
It's a mini. Sexy.
Where's the food I asked you to buy?
You have any money left?
Don't worry about money, man.
After my record...
You sold out the record
to Hilton for $20.
You don't have any more to get.
Just wait until the other producers
hear my record tonight.
We'll drive away
from this place tomorrow.
- Give me $2 for tonight.
- Where I must get it from?
You have it in
your bosom, man.
- I only have $2 left.
- That will do.
I need it to buy food,
and I'm going to church tomorrow.
Come with me.
You don't even have to dance.
No. I'm tired.
I've been walking and
looking for work all day.
I'm not like you.
Want me to go and beg work when
I have a record? I'm done with that.
<i>I not done with it, though.
I was walking all day.</i>
What are you walking for?
You don't believe I gonna make it.
You think I'm just joking?
All I'm telling you
is that I'm tired.
You want me to go and beg work
for $ 10 a week for the rest of my life?
I tried that.
I'd rather die.
And I don't have to,
because I'm gonna make it.
Ivan, you're a dreamer.
Me? Dreamer?
Who's a bigger dreamer than you?
Always talking about milk
and honey in the sky.
Well, no milk and honey in the sky...
not for you, not for me.
It's right down here,
and I want mine now, tonight!
Can I just get out
of this place here?
Sit tight and listen keenly...
while I play for you a brand-new musical
biscuit from the Hilton's empire.
This is a brand-new song they call "The
Harder They Fall" by the man called Ivan.
<i>Well, you tell me
about pie up in the sky</i>
<i>Waiting for me when I die</i>
<i>But between the day
you're born and when you die</i>
<i>Never seem to hear even your cry</i>
<i>- So as sure as the sun
- What do you think of this song?</i>
<i>- Will shine
- Not bad.</i>
<i>I'm gonna get my share, what's mine
- I think it's a hit.</i>
<i>- And then the harder they come
- I said all right.</i>
<i>The harder they'll fall
One and all</i>
<i>The harder they come
the harder they'll fall</i>
<i>One and all</i>
<i>Well, the oppressors
are trying to keep me down</i>
<i>Making me feel like a clown</i>
<i>And they think that
they have got me on the run</i>
<i>I say "Forgive them, Lord
they know not what they've done"</i>
<i>'Cause as sure as the sun will shine</i>
<i>I'm gonna get my share now
What's mine</i>
<i>And then the harder they come
the harder they'll fall</i>
<i>One and all</i>
<i>Harder they come
the harder they'll fall</i>
<i>One and all</i>
<i>Sometime, sometime I feel</i>
<i>The harder, mmm</i>
<i>One more time, one more time</i>
<i>What's happening, Jose?</i>
<i>- Hey, wild man.
- My song got just play, you know.</i>
- Wait! You lie!
- My song!
- Serious? You move up!
- Movin' up, yes.
<i>You didn't come here
to dance tonight.</i>
- I used to show him around the town. Is lie?
- True. True.
- Where that beer? What are you drinking?
- Baby Cham.
- One Baby Cham for my girl.
- What's happening?
- Oh, what's up?
- What's happening?
My singer friend is paying
for the drinks. What are you drinking?
- I drink a stout.
- Beer and stout.
- Where you going?
- Don't worry, man. I'll soon come back.
All right. Beer and stout
for my friend, then.
Here me now. You control
till I come back, all right?
All right.
Where's my order?
- What happened?
- What's the big joke?
- What's the big worry?
- Well, I tried to tell you I have to collect some money.
- All right. Come. I'll give you a ride.
- No, that's all right.
Boy, I like how you slid
out of the bar a while ago.
Since you come town,
you learn a lot.
- But don't try to fool me.
- What do you mean?
Tell me something.
Where did you make that record?
- Hilton.
- I bet you only got $20 for that record.
- Well...
- Don't try to tell me no lie. I know the scene.
I know that it even reach number one,
you not gonna get cent.
- How you know that?
- It's all right. Tell me something.
- Do you think you can handle big money?
- Yes.
- I think I can work out something for you.
- Like what?
I think I can work out
something for you.
- All right.
- Come with me.
<i>You can get it if you really want</i>
<i>You can get it if you really want</i>
<i>You can get it if you really want</i>
<i>But you must try</i>
<i>Try and try, try and try</i>
<i>You'll succeed at last</i>
Where you going?
Police up ahead there.
It's all right, man.
Don't worry yourself.
- What happen if they stop us?
- You ask too much questions. Just enjoy the ride.
Wave.
<i>Got your mind set on a dream</i>
<i>- Honey, you feed the chickens
for me this morning?</i>
- Yes.
- Good.
Don't go too near the fire draft.
You might get sick again.
Your daddy coming, honey.
<i>- Try and try, try and try
- Rupert.</i>
<i>You'll succeed at last</i>
<i>I know it</i>
- You didn't give Miss Elsa trouble today?
- No.
You take your medicine? All right,
here a sweet for your medicine.
- Go get the cutting knife.
- You bring something for me, Ivan?
- This is for Pedro.
- You not catch any fish today?
No, sea rough.
- You have a good girl, you know?
- Yes.
Since Rupert's mother dead,
she take care of him for me.
<i>You can get it if you really want</i>
<i>You can get it if you really want</i>
<i>You can get it if you really want</i>
<i>But you must try</i>
<i>Go to the bar with this.</i>
Tell them we'll send the rest later
and collect tonight.
- Stout for me.
- Stout and no beer?
<i>You can get it if you really want</i>
- How'd it go this week?
- Not too bad, Pedro.
<i>You can get it if you really want</i>
<i>But you must try</i>
- We'll split that.
- Who that for?
Jose don't tell you all this thing?
- About what?
- About this.
- No.
- This half for Jose.
What for?
You think I sell this thing?
So what happens?
Jose collects from everybody?
Everybody who make
more than one trip.
Then how come Jose not rich?
- This not stay with Jose, you know.
- Who it go to?
You ask too much question, man.
We get you.
- Well, so far.
- All right. All right.
The most you have to do
is give Jose $ 15 a week.
Everything all right, right?
Hey, what happening, Pedro?
- Can I drag? All right.
- Mmm.
What happening, Pedro?
Love.
Give me a light.
New to this, man?
In a form.
You need some protection?
- Like what?
- Like... a gun.

How much for this?
$20 for the pair, man.
- I'm not sure if this work.
- Yes, man. It work, man.
It work good, man.
- It's expensive, man.
- No, man. Cheap all your life.
Do you think I should take them
as a matching pair or no?
What do you want to do with it?
You out to kill somebody?
<i>- No, I don't plan killing anybody.
- Then leave it, man. Leave it.</i>
<i>You can tell by the way you look</i>
<i>Your face, your hands, your hair.</i>
<i>Everywhere
as beautiful as can be.</i>
<i>You can tell</i>
<i>It's Chantel</i>
<i>Chantel olive oil pomade... the one that's
rich with lanolin and pure olive oil...</i>
<i>to make your hair soft,
smooth and easy to manage.</i>
<i>- Serve them right.
- Who?</i>
They say they hold a plane
in Florida loaded with ganja.
They say it come from here too.
Let's see.
$ 100,000.
One good thing. They say the U.S. Government
will aid the army to clamp down on them.
Where's Pedro?
- I don't know.
- All right. I'll soon come.
Jose, you read the newspaper?
Mm-hmm. Your play.
Them catch a plane.
Two get through.
Somebody makin' plenty money.
Not us.
I only gettin' spit.
Who makin' all the money?
Ask no questions, tell no lies.
Serious.
We could sell some direct,
you and I.
Your play.
They sellin' the thing for export.
At least we should get a little extra.
I is the one takin' the risk.
You know that.
What, you wanna split?
No, I don't wanna split.
I just want more money.
You're lucky you're makin' a living.
When I know you, down by your ass.
Now you have a Honda parked outside.
I don't like what's going on.
Listen. Better finish
that game, now. Come, Pinky.
That is all we're getting this week? After
we pay Jose, we don't have anything left.
What do you want? I don't even pay
the doctor on Wednesday.
Don't pay Jose this week. Let him take our
share from the money they make in America.
But I have to go explain
the position to Jose.
And it's they caused the army
to burn the field down.
Come here, sir.
Love, man.
Jose, can't pay all this week.
My baby's sick, you know.
No, that's not my concern.
Just $ 15 I need.
- My wife. She get me this week.
- I need just $ 15.
I don't want no soft words.
Just $ 15.
- Just money I give you.
- Money. That's right.
Love, man.
I pay you $5 this week, Jose.
- Keep that till you come out.
- Come out from where?
Pedro, tell him, huh?
I'm not afraid of you,
you know, Jose.
You think it's me
you must be afraid of?
Hello, Mr. Ray. Yes, sir.
<i>The guy I get to help Pedro.
Him giving me a lot of trouble.</i>
<i>We have to lock him up for a while
and teach him a lesson.</i>
Tell me something.
Haven't I seen you
with Jose somewhere before?
Which Jose that?
The same one that send the police
after me, and I shoot him off the bike.
You're a bad man.
- Yeah.
- I see what you mean.
<i>Hey. Hold up a little, man.</i>
<i>Hey, ease up, man.</i>
Stay there.
What happened, eh?
What happened?
<i>All right! See you later.</i>
Wait. What happened, sir?
Oh, you have gun.
And you have on no pants.
You're stupid, huh?
<i>You can get 0-5, 0-6.</i>
<i>- I want every possible car in the area.
- All right.</i>
Lend me a pen and a paper.
Hey, look what a fella
just brought in.
"I have made a record of crime
history"? Do you think the guy's serious?
He's serious enough
to kill three of my men.
You're jokin'.
Three men?
Well, I know because the man
was in my office three minutes ago.
Yeah.
<i>What you doing
down there so long? You thinking?</i>
<i>You mean you can't think
of a story to fool me with tonight?</i>
<i>You go on,
make up your story, man.</i>
<i>What a day when I catch you out,
and no story can help you.</i>
<i>That is the day I'm waiting for.</i>
Hurry, give me a gun, sir.
I must find him in my area.
- Elsa?
- Ivan, what happened?
- You hear anything on the radio?
- The policeman outside said they're looking for you.
- Where's the radio?
- What happened? He say you shoot a policeman.
- You think it's one I drop?
I killed three.
- God forgive you.
- There's nothing on the radio except music.
You'll see a news flash
about me later.
<i>Where are you going now?
Where are you going to hide?</i>
Hide? I not hidin'.
<i>But everybody
will be looking for you.</i>
You didn't believe me?
Didn't I tell you I was
going to be famous one day?
- You're mad.
- Tell Pedro to meet me tonight.
He will know where.
Tell him to bring money
and some more bullets.
Tell him I want to find Jose.
What you want to see Jose for?
Read about that tomorrow.
<i>Oh, it's you.</i>
- Where's Jose?
- What you want him for?
I have something for him.
Give it to me.
I will give it to him.
So you want to give it to him?
I have somethin'
for you too, you know.
Me God. Look what
me get myself into now.
I'll tell you who's crying to me
in bed, double-crossing me.
Jesus Christ!
Jesus Christ!
Jesus Christ! Mercy!
No! No! No!
Don't shoot!
<i>Killed a motorcycle policeman
three days ago.</i>
<i>Last night,
after escaping police,</i>
<i>the wanted man held up a pedestrian
and took away his clothes.</i>
<i>Early this morning, he went
to the house ofJose Smith,</i>
<i>whom he suspected
of informing on him.</i>
<i>Not finding Smith, he shot and wounded
a woman whom he found in Smith's room.</i>
<i>Police sources have identified her as the
same woman who was with the fugitive...</i>
<i>in the hotel room when
the police tried to apprehend him.</i>
<i>This Ras boy. When him come?</i>
<i>Give bike, give money
give place to live.</i>
<i>But when him come today,
get him dead. Get him dead.</i>
<i>Shoot him in the heart.
Kill him.</i>
<i>Me conquer this place
upon birth.</i>
<i>Yeah</i>
<i>Yeah</i>
<i>Jose, you lookin'for me?</i>
I come to shoot you...
<i>Pressure drop, oh, pressure</i>
<i>Oh, yeah, pressure

<i>I said pressure drop
Oh, pressure</i>
<i>Oh, yeah
Pressure put the drop on you</i>
<i>I say you really dropped
Oh, you gotta believe it</i>
<i>Oh, what you are doing is wrong</i>
<i>I say you really dropped

<i>Oh, what you are doing is wrong</i>
<i>Yeah</i>
All right.
You run, but I'll find you.
I'll find you, you hear?
<i>You know where you fucking live!</i>
<i>I'm gonna find you.
I'm gonna find you anyway.</i>
<i>Oh, yeah
Pressure put the drop on you</i>
Anybody see Jose?
- Must have gone underground.
- Must be lookin' police protection.
- Him not comin' for money this week.
- For what? Ivan fixed that.
- Something else happened now.
- Whatever happened, the guy Ivan is our boss.
Hey, sis, you have any tune
over there in the jukebox?
<i>- You find the record yet, man?
- Well, it was put back here a long time ago.</i>
Find the record.
Find it.
<i>El Numero Uno socks the sound
of blood and soul!</i>
Hey, good evening everybody.
Welcome to the Big T show,
back in my home where
the sweet soul sisters roam.
My mojo workin', and my soul
sort of cookin' and snookin'.
Like they say, the "T" thing
goes for four hours long,
- and it's the sound of soul
and big boss country here.
I hear my ring-a-ling.
Let's see what's happening.
Hi. Hello. Good evening,
chicaboo. How are you?
You wanna hear that song again?
You know something?
All the other jocks been gettin'
this call all day...
for this big bad song
about the runaway guy.
I wonder what he's doing now. I think
he's gettin' his thing together too.
We'll play it for you.
That's the same one I had for you.
So here we go.
We're gonna do it for you right now.
- That guy is sort of turning
the nation over, getting everybody...
Wow. I got it for you here.
- So it goes something like this.
Dig it, huh?
<i>Oh, yeah</i>
<i>Oh, yeah</i>
<i>Well, they tell me of a pie
up in the sky</i>
<i>Waiting for me when I die</i>
<i>But between the day
you're born and when you die</i>
<i>They never seem to hear
even your cry</i>
<i>So as sure as the sun will shine</i>
<i>I'm gonna get my share now
What's mine</i>
<i>And then the harder they come
the harder they'll fall</i>
<i>One and all</i>
<i>Ooh, the harder they come</i>
<i>The harder they'll fall
One and all</i>
I can't make this record die again.
<i>The oppressors
are trying to keep me down</i>
Yes, I can usually do it, man,
but it's gone too far now.
<i>It's on the charts.</i>
You know I always cooperate
with the police, man,
but this time...
I know how you feel,
but I wanna catch him myself.
Do me a favor.
You tell me when you catch him,
so I can get him to make another record
for me before you string him up.
Hey, what are you doing
in the man's car?
- You can drive?
- Yes.
Drive.
<i>You can get it if you really want</i>
<i>You can get it if you really want</i>
<i>You can get it if you really want</i>
<i>But you must try</i>
<i>Try and try</i>
<i>Try and try</i>
<i>You'll succeed at last</i>
<i>Mmm-hmm-mmm, oh, yeah</i>
<i>Persecution you must bear</i>
<i>Win or lose
You got to get your share</i>
<i>Got your mind set on a dream</i>
<i>You can get it
though hard it may seem now</i>
<i>You can get it if you really want</i>
<i>You can get it if you really want</i>
<i>You can get it if you really want</i>
<i>But you must try</i>
Sidney, how much time I lock you up?
Three times.
Yes, sir.
How much time I let you off?
Plenty times.
<i>Plenty times.</i>
You remember the number of times
you find yourself up in my yard...
when you go down to the police station,
when you need help?
<i>- Yes, sir.
- You remember the number of times I help you?</i>
<i>- Hey?
- Yes, sir.</i>
How come you know I lookin'
for Ivan for the last two weeks,
and you hidin' Ivan in
your swamps and don't tell me?
<i>Since when another dirty criminal
like yourself mean more to you than me?</i>
You believe him can help you
more than me? Hey?
<i>- Answer me. You believe him can help you more than me?
- No, sir.</i>
Then why the backside you hidin'
him for? What is going on?
<i>You think him smarter than me...</i>
<i>because him have a hundred places
to hide, and I can't find him?</i>
It's not because him smart
I can't find him.
It's because
you're all foolish...
and all believe because I so busy
chasin' Ivan now I forget about you.
But I stop chase Ivan now.
I gonna start chase you.
<i>All of you, and as of this week no more
ganja come into this town, you hear me?</i>
Not a stick, not a spliff,
not even a puff.
<i>I'm going to starve you.</i>
Let me see how much you love
Ivan when your belly empty.
<i>Take one more.</i>
Film finish.
- When I can get them?
- About tomorrow evening.
- Now.
- But it will take me at least...
Now.
All right.
Come this way.
- Last one, that?
- Yes.
<i>Fitz.</i>
<i>- He's busy.
- Okay. I'll wait.</i>
By the way,
they catch the wild guy yet?
<i>I don't hear any news about him,
but I don't want 'em catch him.</i>
I like the excitement.
The boy is great!
All right.
You can come in.
Fitz, why so quiet?
- Backside!
- Come. So.
<i>- Fitz, you have a pen?
- Hey.</i>
<i>- What you want a pen for?
- Autograph, man. Autograph.</i>
<i>- Right here.
- Don't you have one to spare?</i>
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Rest.
<i>This is the last one, sir.</i>
Send this one to the editor.
Make sure him get it.
<i>All right.</i>
Backside.
But you can't expect me not
to publish a picture like this.
But this is a fantastic picture.
You don't want to see it?
- I see you banned the record.
- Yes.
- And you never had the courtesy to tell me.
- I don't understand you, Hilton.
I called you and asked you
for your help. I called you once.
Am I to understand now that the police is
out telling people what they must listen to?
Yes, if it glorifies crime.
So the record get the people
all excited about this guy.
He's a criminal
they're gonna catch anyhow.
<i>It's no big deal.</i>
<i>What I don't understand is when you
start fooling with the hit parade.</i>
When you fool around with that
then they know something is wrong.
<i>- That's when you make the guy into a big deal.
- I can't stop now.</i>
I wanna talk to you.
I hear you stopped the ganja trade too.
<i>- Yes, but I didn't know that interested you.
- Naturally.</i>
This is the only thing
that brings money to this area.
<i>You know something?</i>
No hit parade, no ganja.
Hmm, you better catch him fast.
Once these jokers get hungry enough to start
tradin' without you, then you're finished.
And then law and order finish in this
entire area. You understand that, don't you?
I going.
See the man there.
Shoot! Fire!
<i>Why you not warn me they was coming?</i>
What happened, Elsa?
How him feeling?
Fever gone.
I thank God.
If we don't have to give more blood,
everything will be all right.
The doctor says
he must have good food.
Why is the police raging?
Till last night, them lock up Duffus
and Midnight Cowboy.
As you know,
the bike sell already.
What about the fishing?
To tell you the truth, you know,
that boat, it sell a long,
long time ago, you know.
Even when Ivan was here,
you never had it?
No.
You hear from Ivan?
No.
I wonder how his shoulder
getting on.
- What time Jose coming?
- Soon come.
What I tell him, sir?
Dollar fifty not bad.
Resume.
What we waiting for?
Can't resume just like that.
They want something more.
They won't resume
until they get Ivan.
Anybody see him?
<i>- No.
- My belly empty. My baby belly empty too.</i>
We couldn't just give up Ivan
like that.
Business is business,
you know well, man.
What do you say, Pedro?
<i>Pedro not say nothin'?</i>
Pressure don't reach him yet.
Ivan.
How your shoulder?
Painful, you know.
All right. This is supposed
to drive down the pain, you know.
I hear some people sayin'
they catch me.
No news, man. Propaganda.
Pure propaganda.
I sent them a picture.
How come they don't publish it?
Compulsory.
Everything quiet.
I don't like it.
So what's happening
in the trade?
Well, most of the boys
holding out.
But I don't like what I hear.
What?
Jose.
Him offer some of the boys
a raise... in export.
But that is what I after.
Some of them get
what they look for now.
But now that they get what them want
and nobody see me, they might forget me.
No, man.
Some of us still backing you, you know,
to get rid of Jose altogether.
But you'd better try to get away
before it's too late.
I'm not running, Pedro.
Yes. Freddie.
Him get a job on a boat.
And him can get you to Cuba.
And you'd get
a big welcome there.
Yes.
Revolutionary to Ras.
Could get a doctor
to fix me shoulder too.
<i>True.</i>
<i>Go down to the coast
tomorrow and wait there.</i>
And the boat
will pick you up at the key.
All right.
But I have to see Elsa
and Rupert before I go.
You will see them, man.
You'll see them.
<i>Sitting here in limbo</i>
<i>But I know it won't be long</i>
<i>Sitting here in limbo</i>
<i>Like a bird without a song</i>
<i>Well, they're putting up resistance</i>
<i>But I know that my faith
will lead me on</i>
<i>Sitting here in limbo</i>
<i>Waiting for the dice to roll</i>
<i>Sitting here in limbo</i>
<i>Got some time to search my soul</i>
<i>Well, they're putting up resistance</i>
<i>But I know that my faith
will lead me on</i>
<i>I don't know where life will lead me</i>
<i>But I know where I've been</i>
<i>I can't say what life will show me</i>
<i>But I know what I've seen</i>
<i>Tried my hand at love and friendship</i>
<i>But all that is past and gone</i>
<i>This little boy is moving on</i>
<i>Sitting here in limbo</i>
It's all right, Rupert. Never mind.
Never mind.
Never mind.
Well, I hope the ambulance
won't come, you know.
I prefer no send him
to the hospital.
When he comes out of the hospital,
it's the same thing all over again.
But, Elsa,
I can't stand him cry, you know.
When the trade
going to start again?
They want Ivan, you know.
Definite.
All the boys said
them ready to start.
What you say?
I say no.
What you say, Elsa?
You know what I say, Pedro.
Every game I play, I lose.
- Yes?
- I want to talk to you, sir.
I was just going out.
But I can spare you
a few minutes.
Mr. Ray, the traders don't know
where him is, sir.
They don't know. They don't tell
me, sir. Them don't know, sir!
- Hmm.
- You know what gonna happen?
Them gonna start without me, and I won't be
able to control them 'cause them hungry now.
If they start again,
I'm going to lock them up.
<i>Don't matter. Them gonna start again
because them desperate.</i>
If them start without me,
none of us will be able to control them.
Any criminal can come trade and
don't have to pay no protection money.
<i>- That's your problem.
- My problem, sir?</i>
Look what policeman you have, and them
can't find. You want me to find him.
You have a million
and one policeman.
<i>Right, sir?
But me one must go find him.</i>
You don't understand, Jose?
I stopped chasin' Ivan now.
I want the traders
to bring him to me.
<i>- That is the only way this thing
is going to start back.</i>
Yes?
Yes, Reverend.
His woman came to you for help.
Okay, Corporal. Come, let's go.
Come on. Start the engines.
<i>The gal said him leaving today.
What boat is he leaving on?</i>
You realize if you don't help me
now, you can never trade again.
- You want me hit him again?
- No, we're wasting time.
Come.
We'll get another boat.
Swim, Ivan! Swim!
<i>Grab the rope!</i>
Hold on, man!
<i>Got your mind set on a dream</i>
<i>You can get it
though hard it may seem now</i>
<i>You can get it if you really want</i>
<i>You can get it if you really want</i>
<i>You can get it if you really want</i>
<i>But you must try</i>
<i>Try and try</i>
<i>Try and try</i>
<i>You'll succeed at last</i>
<i>I know it</i>
<i>We're going to do a frontal assault!</i>
All right. Hold on.
Prepare to assault!
All right.
Don't worry
with the army business.
One man just come out.
Who's the bad man?
Who can draw?
Come on out,
one who can draw!
One who can draw,
just come out!
<i>Shut your mouth. He think the hero
can't die until the last reel?</i>
Send out one bad man!
Send him out!
Draw!
<i>Well, the oppressors
are trying to keep me down</i>
<i>Making me feel like a clown</i>
<i>And they think that
they have got me on the run</i>
<i>I say "Forgive them, Lord
they know not what they've done"</i>
<i>'Cause as sure as the sun will shine</i>
<i>I'm gonna get my share now
What's mine</i>
<i>And then the harder they come
the harder they'll fall</i>
<i>One and all</i>
<i>Harder they come
the harder they'll fall</i>
<i>One and all</i>
<i>Oh, yeah</i>
