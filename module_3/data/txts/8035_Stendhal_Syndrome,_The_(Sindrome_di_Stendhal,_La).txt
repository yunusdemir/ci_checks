Miss, -- are you all right?
Here,
let me help you up.
Don't worry; it must
have been the heat.
You've cracked your lip;
it's bleeding a little.
Excuse me, miss.
You forgot this.
Hey,
you're still bleeding.
Take this.
Maybe, you should
sit down a minute.
Do you want me to
take you to a hospital?
No.
My name is Alfredo,
what's yours?
My name --
I found it lying open
on the floor.
Sorry,
I have to go --
Wait!
Let me go with you.
Do you want a taxi?
Do you need
some money?
Do you know
your name?
Can you remember it?
It was the paintings,
wasn't it?
Works of art --
have power over us.
Great works of art
have great power.
Most of them --
they'll never understand,
but --
I do, and I think --
you do too.
I'm sorry,
I have to go.
Hey!
Just a second --
For the taxi.
Don't worry,
just take it.
Miss --
Miss!
Miss Manni!
Miss Manni,
Miss Manni,
didn't you hear me?
Chief Inspector Manetti
called.
He called
a number of times.
It seemed urgent.
Who?
Manetti --
Chief Inspector Manetti.
Who am I?
Manni.
'One to relax,
two to sleep.'
Doctor --
Rome.
Anna Manni.
Hello?
Information?
Yes, I'm looking for
a number in Rome.
Anna Manni.
Yes.
Hi, this is Anna.
Leave me a message,
and I'll call you back
as soon as I can.
Stand back --
back.
Set up those lights
over there --
Haven't seen anything
like it.
Where are we?
Rome --
But,
you can't pass here.
It's all right.
I'm a police officer.
She's okay,
I know her.
Where have you been?
We found her
an hour ago.
Manetti is
checking it out.
He wants to talk you.
- Over there, huh.
- Manni, over here.
She's been dead
for about 12 hours.
Looks like,
the same guy --
raped fifteen women,
killed the last two.
I want you to
go to Florence.
We're sure,
he has raped
three women there,
but,
he hasn't killed yet.
Why?
Three in Florence,
and the rest in Rome.
You've followed
all the cases here,
and you know
the way he operates;
it's up to you.
You leave tomorrow.
Talk to our people
in Florence.
Tell them
what you know,
and find out
what they know.
Diplomatically,
huh?
You're bright.
I can trust you.
Now that he has
started killing,
he won't stop.
The pig.
This guy's a real whacko.
Did you see the other
two, he killed?
Anna,
I'm out of here,
too.
How about going to
your place for --
a pizza,
a video?
Marco!
Your gun --
Assistant Inspector
Manni.
Did you come to Florence,
just to look for me?
Well,
you found me.
Here I am.
No!
I want you the way you
were this morning ---
With your lips bleeding.
I wanted so badly
to kiss your mouth,
your bleeding lips.
No,
don't.
Stay awake.
I watched while you
were looking
at the paintings;
you got that feeling,
didn't you?
You got that feeling.
No --
no --
stay awake.
I want you
to come with me.
Stop!
Stop!
No!
No!
Hey,
what happened to you?
Calm down!
Calm down.
I'm a police officer
from Rome.
Anna Manni.
Where are the
paramedics?
Hurry!
The lab team
is working on the room.
How's Anna?
This place is a mess.
Sir, I found this,
out in the hall.
Okay,
we're finished.
We'll have the results
for you
in a couple of days.
Do you feel up to
talking?
Yes.
Was there
anything unusual
about his features?
No.
Could you identify him
if you saw him again?
Yes.
Do you remember
having seen him before?
Yes,
at the police station.
He's identical to
the composite they made
of the murderer.
We're doing
all the clinical tests --
except for the HIV.
It's still too early
for that.
You should have one
in a month,
then in three,
and after six months.
I know it's rough,
but, there's nothing
to be done.
No.
I'm sorry about
all of this.
But,
the law requires it.
It's a light sedative,
to help you relax.
If you don't want
it just say so.
You need to rest, and
get your strength back.
Don't worry about
your loss of memory;
this kind of amnesia
is almost,
always temporary.
Lie down
for a few minutes,
and try to sleep.
Anna, I'll be right
outside if you need me.
Get some rest.
Okay?
Miss --
Are you alright?
Oh, you've
broken your glass.
Yes.
Would you like
something for that cut?
We have an antiseptic
in the first-aid box.
No.
Oh, sorry.
Maybe,
she was right.
You should put
something on that cut.
It's bleeding a lot.
Does it hurt?
No.
Sure?
Sure,
it just stings a little.
Anna!
Hi!
Let me take your bag.
No, no.
Come on,
I'll carry it.
Okay.
So --
how're you doing?
Inspector Manetti is
on his way.
Good luck.
Anna, the commission
has arrived.
They're in there
waiting for you.
They're familiar
with your case;
so, don't worry.
They just want to
talk to you.
Why did you
cut your hair so short?
I don't know.
I feel better
like this.
Why, is it a problem?
Absolutely not.
Here --
a new badge,
and a new gun
to replace the ones
that bastard stole.
There was no negligence
on your part.
The commission
just confirmed
what I knew already.
You know
how fond I am of you,
how much
I value your work.
I feel terrible
about what happened.
Maybe,
it was partly my fault.
Nine millimeter.
The rounds are
steel-capped,
about the best
defensive weapon,
you can have.
Uh, they want you
to stick around
at headquarters
for a while.
There's a lot of work
for someone, like you.
And,
they want you
to start seeing
our psychologist,
twice a week.
We'll get him,
Anna.
Wherever he is,
we'll find him.
Do you remember,
what you said
about when
they start to kill,
they never stop?
Uh huh.
But,
he didn't kill me.
I think,
he wants me alive.
We don't have to
look for him;
he'll come to me.
Look,
starting from today,
you'll have
an around-the-clock
police escort.
Two of our best men.
Hi,
this is Anna.
Leave me a message,
and I'll call you back
as soon as I can.
Thank you.
I was sent
to Florence because
I do
most of my work
with the
anti-rape team.
It all started
with a series of cases,
in Rome,
and nearby towns.
Then in a month,
there were three cases
in Florence.
And so, my boss
sent me up there
to exchange information
with the
local police,
to find out
what they knew.
I was in my hotel room
one morning,
when I got
a phone call.
It was a woman.
She said --
she said,
she knew, I was working
on the case.
And,
she thought she knew,
who the man was.
She told me her name,
but I can't remember it.
She said
he was in town,
and would visit
the Uffizi Gallery.
How did she
know that?
I don't know.
She just said that he'd
be there that morning.
Did you call headquarters
in Florence?
No.
I went to the museum.
I had a vague idea
of what he looked like
because I saw
the composites
at the police station.
It was a long shot --
but I went anyway.
Pretty stupid,
huh?
Yes, I've always been
too sure of myself.
You know,
what I thought?
I thought
that if I saw him,
I'd arrest him,
or shoot him,
if necessary.
What happened
at the museum?
There was
a long line,
Iots of confusion.
Inside --
it was really weird,
a strange atmosphere.
The paintings,
they -- they
seemed to be floating.
I followed a group
of tourists into a room.
Then,
I entered a painting.
It was
as if I --
if I was
suddenly immersed in it.
I mean, I was looking
at it when--
I know,
it sounds crazy.
Let's try
never to use words,
Iike crazy.
The symptoms include
a cold sweat, nausea,
anxiety,
hallucinations,
severe depression, and
personality changes.
Yes.
In 1817, a French writer,
Stendhal
was in Florence.
He was admiring
the works of art
in the church of
Santa Croce,
when he was overcome by
powerful emotions.
It had certainly
happened
to others before him,
but, he was the first
to write
about the phenomenon
in his diary.
That's why,
what happened to you
in the Uffizi
is known as
the Stendhal Syndrome.
'My feeling is
so profound
that it
borders on pity.
All this speaks clearly
to my soul.
Oh, if only
I could forget it.
There was a certain
degree of happiness
in this powerful feeling
of Stendhal's.
Yet,
in spite of that,
the only thing he wanted
to do was forget it.
Hi, Anna,
how's it going?
Hi,
how you doing?
Hi.
Can I come in?
Sure.
Everything okay?
Stupid question.
I brought you something.
Videos --
Buster Keaton films --
for a laugh.
Frozen pizzas --
and,
a bunch of flowers --
for you.
Marco,
I don't want these things.
Don't worry.
I'll leave it for you,
anyway.
You eating these?
Yes.
But, you never used to
eat chocolates.
Well, now I find,
I like to.
I miss you,
Anna.
No, I can't
make love, Marco.
I can't even
think about it.
You see -- I'm not your
woman anymore.
No.
I'm sorry.
But it's been so long
since we --
since we made love.
Right.
So,
you want to have sex?
So,
you want to fuck, huh?
- Come on, Anna--
- You want to screw me, huh?
Don't, Anna.
Stop.
Turn around.
No,
what're you doing?
You want to fuck me,
huh?
Now,
I'm fucking you.
I'm fucking you.
Anna, stop it!
Please.
You like it --
huh?
Like to be fucked,
huh?
Anna,
come on --
Shut up!
I don't want to
hear your voice.
Just shut up!
Anna!
I'm fucking you --
Sure you like it --
We haven't
finished yet --
Anna!
Anna, I'm not --
Shit!
I wanted to fuck him
like a man --
the way
that men do it.
The idea of being fucked
disgusts me,
of having sex
make me puke.
I'm scared.
Of what?
Something,
that's inside of me,
that makes me
hurt myself.
I keep cutting myself,
hurting myself,
mainly the hands.
But, I don't do it
on purpose --
Maybe,
I do.
The physical pain
doesn't bother me.
It makes me feel alive.
Now,
let's put things in order.
Two very serious things
happened to you.
A rapist killer
stalked you,
jumped you
and all the rest,
and there's a
good chance
that he'll come
looking for you again.
That's one thing.
Second,
you got a shock
Iooking at
those paintings.
A shock followed
by hallucinations;
the Stendhal Syndrome.
That's important too.
But, it's an illness
that will soon be over,
and the memory
of what you felt
will fade away
until it
practically disappears.
For the moment,
you have to try
to love yourself more,
to stop
despising yourself
because you were raped.
Don't hate yourself
because he desires you.
You aren't responsible
for all that.
Where does
your family live?
Viterbo.
Why don't you
get away for a while,
Ieave Rome.
I'll tell your boss.
Go to Viterbo.
It's close enough
for us
to continue
our meetings.
I don't like
going back there.
I joined the police force
to get away,
from everything
that place meant to me.
My brothers,
school friends,
my house,
my father.
Anna,
you're back!
Hi.
Giulio!
Always hang out
in this square, huh?
Giulio,
come here.
Hey,
look who is back.
What did they do?
Kick you
off the force?
No,
I'm on leave.
Hey, why don't you pass
by old Mario's gym?
Watch out!
I've been training.
Oh, yeah?
Ciao.
Anna.
Hi, dad.
You're in time
for dinner.
Your brothers are here,
already.
New haircut --
You've changed the way
you dress too --
You look different.
Yeah,
you look like a boy.
What did you
have to say
she looked
like a man for?
Because
she does dad.
- You saw
- So?
She's hardly back
in the house,
and you have to
upset her.
Did the police send you
to a doctor?
Psychologist.
Is that necessary?
Yes.
I think so.
I have problems
you know.
Is it closed,
the museum?
It's been
under restoration Anna
for the past two years.
Anna, Anna.
No, my father never
set foot in the museum.
I used to go there
with my mother.
She tried to teach me
Art History.
She was a painter.
Why do you think
this incident
came to mind
only today?
I don't know.
I was driving
past the museum,
which is closed
for restoration work --
and I remembered it.
Doctor, I think I might
try painting,
something myself.
Is that alright?
Absolutely, I think
it is an excellent idea.
Anna,
what are you?
Calm down before
somebody gets hurt.
Yeah,
we're training --
All right you two,
don't just stand there.
Let's mix it up a little.
Okay, if you want
to get serious.
Hey --
So I left him --
I just had to.
Not that he was bad
in bed.
I mean in bed
he made up for it,
but some things are
just too much.
You know,
what I mean?
He kept
pushing and pushing,
and finally,
something snapped.
No, I don't
expect guys
to be completely
honest with me.
Do I look like
somebody
who believes
in fairytales?
But still, a girl
appreciates a gentleman
now and then.
Sure,
I'd like to kiss you too.
He never
liked kissing.
I am the opposite.
I am the oral type.
Wait -- there is a place
back here.
Where,
where you know,
the local whores go.
Come --
come, come.
A hooker from Senegal
called us,
one of the bunch that
does tricks in this area.
She brings here clients,
back here at night.
Found her
lying down there.
Hold on a second.
It's him again,
same technique.
What did you see?
I come here alone,
see.
I called my friend.
I don't know,
who she is.
And you?
I've never seen her.
I've never seen her.
It was definitely,
what is his name,
Alfredo.
There is nothing
to be afraid of.
We have got you
protected night and day.
You see that guy
down there.
His name is
Parisi.
He was in the marines,
a captain;
they're pretty tough.
Now here's that list,
you wanted.
I don't get it Anna.
What are you doing?
Why do you want
to contact
all the women,
he raped?
I mean --
I don't know.
I just want to
talk to them.
Who knows -- maybe
I'll learn something.
Well, you didn't need to
drive all this way
to give me
these phone numbers.
You could have
faxed them.
No, no, no.
I wanted to --
I wanted to see you.
Anna, tell Marco
to come in.
No,
he has to go.
What did you say
you wanted?
To see you.
So,
what do you see?
Who is it,
hello?
Hello,
what is your name?
Vincenzo.
And I bet, your last
name is Gorlai, right?
Yes.
Is your mommy home?
Mommy!
Hello.
Yes, my name is
Anna Manni.
Do I know you?
No,
no, I am a police officer.
I work with the ARD,
the Anti-Rape
Department.
I see.
What can I do for you?
I would like to ask you
about your experience.
Nothing very --
I'm really sorry,
but I can't answer
any questions.
Yes I know,
how hard it is --
It isn't a question of
hard or easy.
I don't want to answer
any more questions;
that's all.
I am here
with my children.
I was lucky
I wasn't murdered.
I am here now,
and I don't want
to go back there.
So,
you really want to know
what happened to me?
Yes,
if you want to tell me.
Sure,
I do.
I remember
trusting him.
I was
lying in a field.
I remember, his hands
around my neck
squeezing tighter
and tighter,
and the feeling of
being torn
between the legs,
inside.
I remember,
that every time
he stopped
squeezing my neck,
he hit me
in the face.
I remember,
his stinking breath.
Then I also remember
thinking,
this son of a bitch.
This son of a bitch
isn't very different
from my ex-husband,
that pig.
You know, this city is
full of monsters.
People moving away
from large
built up areas,
attracted by safer,
more acceptable
living conditions
in the provinces
are having to pay
an unexpected price.
Rents are rising
in small to medium --
Yes,
You continue to talk
about my wife's murder,
but you don't
accept all the rest.
-- before she was killed.
I'm sorry
to have disturbed you
Mr. Manini.
I shouldn't have.
And all this
happened to my wife!
-- I called.
And I'll never know
what she had to endure.
What torture?
Can you tell me?
Can you tell me what
she was thinking?
What she was feeling?
Can YOU tell
me Miss Manni?
Left --
combination -- left
Iooking good,
keep it up.
Keep it moving --
I'm sorry Anna.
I didn't mean to --
sorry.
Why?
The blood
makes you sick, huh?
Look --
Hey Anna --
Look!
I am eating
with Alessandro.
Join us, Dad.
Hello.
Hello, Anna.
I've missed you.
I have thought
a lot about you.
My feeling
is so profound
that it borders
on pity.
All this speaks
clearly to my soul.
Ah, if only I
could forget it.
Yes, if only
I could forget.
Stendhal couldn't.
And you,
can you forget?
Can you forget me?
I've missed you
so much.
Never three with
the same match.
It's unlucky.
Do you hear that noise?
It's running water.
It is absolutely pure.
Do you remember when
you were pure?
You know junkies used
to use this place,
but something must
have scared them away.
They left to shoot up
somewhere else.
No!
Let's play a game.
We are out
in the country,
2 miles east
of the highway.
There is no trace
of Anna.
No, no, no,
the helicopter has to go
back to base
and continue the search
tomorrow morning.
Of course,
I am going to carry on.
How many other teams
can you get
to patrol
the rest of this area?
Ring, ring, ring --
Remember, I like to
make phone calls too.
Oh yes,
I really do.
Like when I called you
in Florence,
except then
I had this voice --
"You don't know me,
but there is something,
I must tell you.
The man
you are looking for
will be visiting
the Uffizi Gallery
this morning."
Yeah, I like
making phone calls.
And you fell for it.
I'd already spotted you
in Rome.
I knew what you wanted.
You wanted me.
You like me,
don't you?
I know you are always
on my side,
and I love you too.
I see you
changed guns --
moved up to
a 9 millimeter.
You don't use this baby
to stop your man.
You use it
when you want
to blow him to bits.
I have to meet somebody
in town.
I've something
she desperately --
desires.
What fresh,
invigorating air.
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help! --
Help!
Help!
Help!
You'll have to do a lot
better than that.
Wait a minute.
Shoot me.
Are you going to
shoot me?
You can't shoot me.
You're a fucking cop.
You have to arrest me.
Arrest me.
It's my right.
You have the right
to shut up.
Well, is that better?
Move.
Can't you move?
What about a walk
in nice fresh air.
How do you like the
fresh, invigorating air?
Can you hear the water?
It's so clean.
Do you remember
when you were clean?
What are
you looking at?
You want to have sex?
No really, tell me,
what do you want?
Don't be shy.
What?
Oh, I see,
you want to
take a bath,
because you feel dirty.
Yes, you want to
take a long bath.
Will I have this scar
forever?
No, you'll see.
With a little
plastic surgery,
in no time you'll
be as good as new.
No sign of the scar.
Here,
look at this map.
You see, the river
runs down the valley
for a mile and a half,
and then ends up
in the water company's
outfall drain.
Why is locating the body
such a problem?
Because the drain is
divided into
dozens of
filtering channels.
You know,
how it is inspector.
There was a scramble
for contracts
around here
when it was built,
and a lot of people
tried to get in on the act.
So, nobody knows
where this damn river
ends up.
I am an engineer
in the maintenance
department inspector.
I didn't have
anything to do
with the speculation
that went on.
I want that body found.
A broken neck,
a 9-millimeter bullet
in his chest,
and enough blood around
to fill a bathtub --
I still
want that body.
He is gone forever,
Anna.
Dead --
you killed him.
He will
never go away.
He will always
come back, always.
Hello.
Just a moment
please,
I have Chief Inspector
Manetti for you.
Thank you.
Anna,
I'm going to pay a visit
to that bastard's wife.
You were right.
His name was Alfredo,
Alfredo Grossi.
I thought, you'd want
to come along,
since it's your case.
Yes, I do.
Okay.
We'll pick you up
in 15 minutes.
We know, this is hard
for you Mrs. Grossi.
Now, we'd like
to ask you
about your
husband's movements.
Dates,
the days he wasn't home.
That's her.
That's her,
isn't it!
Excuse me.
I saw her picture
in the papers,
and on TV.
Mrs. Grossi,
this is Inspector Manni,
one of our best officers.
She's been working
on the case,
and has every right
to be here.
I'm not answering
any questions
in front of her.
Would you like to
reconsider that?
Sorry,
it's out of the question.
Now,
from the beginning.
Bear with me,
Mrs. Grossi.
I would like to know
exactly
where and when
you last saw,
your husband.
I feel myself
changing.
My friend Betty says
I'm crazy.
Why do you continue
to use the word crazy?
You know,
what I thought yesterday?
I thought,
my real name was Louise.
Louise --
Do you like Louise?
You're amazing.
You never say anything.
I read a really
interesting story
on the way here.
There's this judge,
sitting on a riverbank.
A traveler asks him,
"May I use this boat? "
and he says,
"Sure. It's fine."
So, the traveler
pushes the boat
into the water,
but it sinks,
and he drowns.
A man
who was watching,
shouts at the judge,
"But why didn't you
warn him
that the boat
had a hole in it?"
And the great judge
replies,
"The question
of the boat's
condition
was not raised."
I know
you're suffering,
but the things that
happened take time.
I don't have time.
He might appear
at any moment.
He's dead Anna.
Yeah?
Who says so?
You?
Did they find the body?
No.
I can sense,
he is still thinking
about me.
That he wants me.
That he still exists.
Anyway,
thanks to you
I have recovered
from one thing:
the Stendhal Syndrome.
Paintings don't
obsess me anymore.
On the contrary --
Don't
look at it,
he left his mark
on me.
They say that after
two years
and four operations,
the scar
will disappear.
Do you think it will?
Sorry.
Are you interested
a lot in Art?
Yes.
You too?
Oh,
very much, yes.
I studied Fine Arts
two years here.
Really!
One second,
I'll get it for you.
No.
No?
Well, okay thanks.
My --
My name is Marie,
-Hi
-Hi
Marie?
Yes,
Marie,
I'm French.
But --
I thought that Marie
was a woman's name.
Well, in French
it isn't so exact.
It can be
a man or woman.
Oh.
Do you have a --
voiture?
Oh,
you mean a car?
Yes.
No, I don't.
Then, if you like,
I can give you a ride
on my French scooter.
Okay.
Okay?
My name is Anna.
C'est avec
un grand plaisir
que je fait
votre connaissance.
It is a --
plaisir --
to meet you too,
Marie.
No, Ma-rie.
Ma-rie.
Voila --
Marie.
Marie.
I Iove Art too.
What made you come
to Italy to study Art?
Oh, le renaissance,
rinascimento,
Ie baroque,
Rafaello, Michelangelo,
Masaccio, Simone Martini,
Titiano, Giorgione,
Botticelli, Rosso
Fiorentino, Caravaggio,

Beato Angelico
Viligelmo,
Gia como Della Porta
Piero
della Francesca!
He thinks,
I am a Law student.
And why
didn't you tell him
that you were
a policewoman?
I don't know.
What do you
like about him?
Well, first of all that
he isn't a cop.
Have you thought about
how you met him?
Yes, I was looking
at some paintings.
Like Alfredo.
But,
it's not the same thing;
you know,
it isn't.
I thought, I'd turned
into an arid,
mediocre person.
And then, I met
a very sweet French boy
who made me smile.
I thought, you'd be
pleased to know --
something.
That I laughed too.
Here, try this.
My mother send it
from France.
What is it?
Why do you ask?
Don't you trust me?
It is foie gras.
What?
Goose liver.
It's really good.
It's really --
tasty.
I've always
hated liver.
Tout va bien.
Wait.
Don't move.
Let me do it.
No,
let me do it.
Anything new?
No, nothing.
Anna?
She's home.
Okay,
you guys can go.
I'll be here
until 3 or 4, okay?
Okay.
Hello!
Hello,
hello, who's there?
Marco,
there was someone
in the street
over there.
He looked like
Alfredo.
I've been here
for hours.
I haven't seen anyone.
Nobody who looked
like him, that's for sure.
Come on, I'll
come home with you--
so you can relax.
But --
It's okay.
Let's go,
come on.
It's kind of funny
sitting here,
having all
this freaky Art
Iooking down at you.
Please,
it's not true.
Marco!
No!
Don't say that --
Marco!
No, leave him alone.
PIease.
No, he's got nothing
to do with all this.
No, you better not
touch him.
Marco!
Hello?
Hello!
It was him.
We'll tap your phone.
Right away,
don't worry.
What did he say?
He said --
Anna,
what did he tell you?
He said, he knows
I've been with Marie.
Who is she?
No,
I mean Ma-rie.
He is a boy,
a friend of mine
from France.
He said,
he knows we're in love,
that me make love,
and he's very jealous.
He said, he's going to
teach him a lesson.
Doesn't sound like him.
That is not
his way of operating.
He is not interested
in men.
He said,
"I'm very jealous of him,
and I am going to
teach him a lesson
once and for all."
Hello?
Yes,
Marie Beyle please.
Okay then, tell him
that Anna called,
and to call her back
as soon as he comes in.
Okay, thank you.
Hello.
Hello,
it's Marie here.
Are you alright?
Tell me,
you're okay.
Of course,
I'm okay.
Marco,
you can hang up now.
I've missed you
so much.
Me too, Anna.
I miss you, too.
All I do
is think of you.
I know it's stupid
but I can't stop.
I'm always thinking
about you,
your mouth,
your hands --
Me too, Anna.
I love you.
If anything happened
to you, I think I'd die.
But,
what are you saying?
Hello?
I'm here, Anna.
So, when will you finish
your project?
In half an hour.
Okay.
Wait for me.
I'll meet you there.
Okay.
I want to make love
to you.
Me too, bye.
Marco,
I'm going to take a bath.
Okay.
It's closed.
Sorry,
it's closed for today.
I'm looking for
Marie Beyle.
Marie?
Never heard of her.
Him.
He's a man.
He works here
as a research assistant.
Is that so?
And who might
you be?
Now, get your fucking
walkie-talkie out,
and find him
before you lose your job.
Okay.
-Hi!
-Oh, Anna!
Excuse me.
-Hi.
-Hi.
We're finished,
okay.
I just need
a few more minutes.
Okay.
How many minutes?
Oh, just a few.
I have to put away
the models
and canvases.
So, can you wait
downstairs?
You can't stay here.
Okay, I'll wait for you
downstairs.
Okay.
What is it, hmm?
Nothing.
It's just that --
it's just that
there are some things
I didn't tell you.
Okay, later then.
Okay.
A bientot.
A tout
a' l'heure.
Ah, ton
Francais e' parfait.
Yeah.
But, promise me
that you'll come down
as soon as
you're finished.
Yes.
I'll come straight
to you.
-Bye.
-Bye.
Who is it?
Professor!
Professor!
Is anybody in there?
Tell me,
what to do.
Should I,
lock the doors?
Yes,
there's a body in there.
-Let me go!
-Hey,
-Let me go!
-Wait!
You can't go in there.
No!
No!
No!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
No!
Let go of her!
Let her go!
No!
Marie!
Marie!
Marie!
Marie!
Anna,
Anna, Anna--
Listen
Don't touch him.
Anna.
Anna, it's me.
Who called him?
Anna ---
My son talked of you
so much!
He used to call you,
"My marvelous
little Anna"!
Come on, Marco.
Come on!
I didn't mean
to scare you.
Everything
scares me.
There are some things
I want to
talk to you about.
Do you have time?
Yes.
He'll never give up,
will he?
He's the kind of
murderer who only stops
when he's caught --
or killed.
That's what a lot of
people are hoping
will happen.
Anyway,
the important thing is
for you
to understand
that he is not
infallible.
He can be caught;
after all,
he's just a man.
You know that
he's just a man?
He'll never let himself
be caught.
How can you --
be so sure?
Because --
because he knows.
Because
he knows what?
Everything.
Every fucking thing.
But,
how could he Anna?
How could
he know everything?
What's
the hold up?
Bring it
over here.
Come on,
come on,
hurry up guys,
let's go.
Judging by its state
from over here,
I'd say,
it's been in the water
for at least three weeks,
maybe more.
Roberto!
Yes sir.
How was he supposed
to be dressed?
According
to the composite,
blue trousers,
white T-shirt
and black socks.
Okay.
Mario!
Mario!
I want to see you
up there.
Officer!
Officer!
Officer!
What did I tell you?
It's a real
maze of canals.
The body
was probably knocked
through one conduit
after another.
I told you --
speculation.
You say, you
should have realized
he wouldn't let you
have him.
Have who?
Marie.
Alfredo doesn't want me
to have anybody else.
Which means you are
his, and no one else's.
Why do you say that?
You said
he knows everything.
Are you sure?
Yes.
At least, he knows
everything about me.
Just a moment, think
of what you just said.
'He knows
everything about me.'
You really believe that?
Believe it?
I know it.
And, you believe
that he knows
you better
than you
know yourself.
Is that what you think?
What I think is
that you should leave.
Now, please go!
Why you want me
to leave, Anna?
Hi,
this is Anna.
Leave me a message,
and I'll call you back
as soon as I can.
Thank you.
Anna,
it's Marco.
We found Alfredo.
We just hauled his body
out of the canal.
It's been in the water
for three weeks.
You know
what that means?
There's another lunatic
running around,
an imitator.
Call me as soon
as you hear this.
That's no surprise,
is it?
We knew,
that Alfredo was dead,
and that it wasn't him
who killed Marie.
What are you
getting at?
It's the moment of truth,
Anna.
The time has come
to shake off the lies,
Iike you take
a winter coat off
when summer comes.
Right Manetti.
A minimum of
three weeks.
There's no doubt chief.
It's him.
Her police escort?
Why isn't there one
at night?
I called her,
but there's no answer.
Yes,
I'm on my way there, now.
I'll stay tonight.
Christ!
Where were you?
Here.
I called you
over and over.
Maybe,
I was in the bathroom.
Didn't you
get my message?
This afternoon,
they found
Alfredo Grossi's body
in the canal.
So?
So, --
why don't you let me in?
Why should I?
Don't you realize
he's dead?
It wasn't --
Alfredo.
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
My God!
He forced his way
in here.
He was saying
crazy things.
He made no sense,
and then --
and then he tried --
he wanted to rape me.
He tried to do the same
thing Alfredo did.
It was him Marco.
He killed Marie.
He was the only one
who knew everything,
because I told him.
Why didn't you
call us?
But,
don't you understand?
He killed Marie
out of jealousy.
He didn't want me
to love anybody else.
Why didn't you
call me?
Anna,
I don't believe it.
I mean,
I just don't.
What?
What don't you believe?
That the doctor wanted
to rape you --
and then --
he killed Marie.
What do you
believe then?
Anna,
I don't think
you understand
right now, okay?
The body you found
isn't Alfredo.
It isn't him.
It was definitely him,
Anna.
No!
It isn't AIfredo.
What are you
talking about?
Because,
I know where he is.
Where is he?
He is inside of me.
I've become him.
He's like an infection,
a cancer that grows
bigger everyday.
Everyday his presence
inside me gets stronger.
Why didn't you realize?
Why didn't you help me?
Why didn't you stop me
before I killed --
before I killed Marie?
He forced his way
into me --
and now,
I can't get rid of him.
Anna.
Anna,
listen.
You have to help me
get rid of him --
because he won't stop.
He controls me.
He orders me to do
horrible things --
Iike killing Marie --
and my doctor.
Okay, relax.
Calm down.
Listen, I have to
take you somewhere.
No.
No,
don't worry.
A place
where they'll help you.
Where's your gun?
My gun?
Yes.
Where's it,
Anna?
Why?
Do you need it?
It will help us.
Okay.
Then come with me.
He loves paintings.
Maybe,
that's why he likes
to be inside of me--
because I love art too.
It's in here.
I'll get it.
Do you recognize me
now?
It's me,
Alfredo.
Spread out, and check
the whole street.
Hurry up!
I told you
I wasn't dead,
but -- but
you didn't believe me.
I have to remember
to fix everything
before I leave.
Everything
must be in order.
Ah,
that's very important.
I have to go to
Dad's on Wednesday.
Yes.
Yes,
I mustn't forget that;
it's really important.
And then, I have to
pick up the clothes
at the dry cleaner's.
That's very, very --
that's very important.
Yes.
No, that's the first thing
and the second --
the second --
the second,
the clothes
at the dry cleaner's.
Yes.
Yes.
That's important.
No.
No.
Where do I go
from here?
Where?
Get her,
but don't shoot.
Don't you dare shoot.
It's Anna.
Don't you dare!
Okay.
Okay, I think
I did everything.
Yes, At least,
I did what I had to.
Now, maybe, if I stop here
to rest a little,
maybe they won't
bother me,
and they won't see me.
No.
No, No, No,
better turn around.
I'm so tired.
I need to be alone.
Some people--
Hey, stop!
Wait!
Wait!
Wait!
- What are you doing?
- What're you doing
with that gun?
You want to
shoot me, huh?
- Where're you going?
- You want to shoot me?
Where're you going,
Anna?
Stop it!
- Calm down!
-Stop it!
You want to kill me?
Calm down!
I'm telling you
to calm down.
No!
Let me go!
Let me go!
-Leave me alone!
-Hold her.
Leave me alone!
Leave me alone!
Don't be afraid.
We're not against you.
What's her problem?
Just trust me.
Trust me,
please.
Yes, Anna.
Yes.
Okay, that's it.
It's okay.
That's it.
There we go.
It's OK
It's alright.
