We didn't think that karting
would become a career,
but it's taking on a bigger dimension
<i>and we're a bit worried because
he'll probably race in Formula One.</i>
May God always protect him.
All the dangers are my biggest fear.
<i>I would like to thank him,
because he is a good son and this year</i>
he has worked very hard... and honestly.
That is more important than any title for me.
<i>The time has come.</i>
<i>Ayrton is ready to ride in a
Formula One car for the first time.</i>
I believe it was God who gave me this opportunity,
I've been waiting for a long time.
And now it is helpful to
remain calm, tranquil, relaxed.
Ayrton, this is a beautiful city,
with wonderful streets to walk,
but unsuitable to host a race, no?
Indeed. I arrived at the last minute
and I was surprised. I've never been to Monaco.
I did some testing,
and fortunately, I managed to adapt to the track.
There is no margin for error:
any error would result in an accident.
But for now, I'm satisfied.
<i>I was already traveling a lot,
reporting on Formula One,</i>
<i>when Ayrton began to stand out.
He was driving for Toleman.</i>
<i>Toleman wasn't a winning team.</i>
<i>It wasn't a winning car.</i>
<i>It was never going to win a race.</i>
<i>That's why what Ayrton did
in Monaco was true genius.</i>
<i>And he goes wild</i>
<i>and overtakes Niki Lauda!</i>
<i>Ayrton Senna takes second place</i>
<i>at the most dangerous part of the track!</i>
<i>It's incredible!</i>
<i>Ayrton waves his arms wildly,</i>
<i>celebrating as if he won the race!</i>
<i>If we had continued for a few more laps,</i>
<i>I am sure Ayrton would have passed him.</i>
I had a serious chance of winning,
but until you cross
the finish line in first position,
it is impossible to make a prediction.
Formula One is politics, money,
and while you are making your way through it,
you must deal with such things.
<i>Ayrton Senna the new star of Formula One!</i>
<i>Appearing for the first time
on the Formula One podium</i>
<i>after a fantastic performance.</i>
<i>Even as a child,
he already knew what he wanted</i>
<i>and that he would make it happen.</i>
<i>For example, he always paid
extra attention in class,</i>
<i>so he didn't have to study at home</i>
<i>and would have more time to play on his go-kart.</i>
<i>Ayrton was a genius in the rain.</i>
<i>When the conditions were bad,</i>
<i>and the track became slippery,</i>
<i>he had a higher gear.</i>
<i>The Estoril race was incredible.</i>
<i>He lapped all his opponents except one.</i>
<i>It is wonderful! An extraordinary feeling.</i>
<i>I am very happy because,
in my second year in Formula One,</i>
<i>I managed to fulfill my first dream,
which was to win my first Grand Prix.</i>
<i>It is something unique.</i>
I think many Japanese girls
are fans of Mr. Senna.
Now I am close to him and I'm so nervous.
<i>The first year at McLaren was
very decisive in Ayrton's life.</i>
<i>He was very tense.</i>
<i>It was like he had the weight
of the world on his shoulders</i>
<i>because he now had the responsibility</i>
<i>to prove he really was a top driver.</i>
<i>It is the fifteenth Grand Prix of the season.</i>
<i>As the sun rises,
Brazil will await the checkered flag</i>
<i>and for Ayrton Senna to win
his first world title in Formula One,</i>
<i>realising a dream he had since he was a child.</i>
<i>We are about to start. Green light.</i>
<i>Senna does not start!</i>
<i>Prost came out ahead
while Ayrton Senna was left behind.</i>
<i>Ayrton Senna is in 14th place.</i>
<i>I thought, "So long title.
It's over. It's over."</i>
<i>He takes eighth place.
An amazing comeback from Senna.</i>
<i>Then his favorite thing happened:</i>
<i>it began to rain.</i>
<i>Senna is now in fourth position.</i>
<i>Senna's coming, he's coming, coming, coming!</i>
<i>Ayrton Senna goes for it and overtakes Prost!</i>
<i>I started giving thanks during the last lap.</i>
<i>I thanked God.</i>
<i>It was incredible. I could not believe
I was going to win the championship,</i>
despite all the anxiety and tension,
I felt God's presence.
I have seen God.
<i>It was a very special moment for me.</i>
<i>An indescribable feeling,</i>
<i>it remains engraved in my memory
and is a part of me.</i>
<i>Ayrton Senna raises his fist,
triumphantly, it's victory!</i>
<i>Ayrton Senna... of Brazil!</i>
<i>World Champion 1988!</i>
<i>What an incredible race!</i>
<i>A brilliant win because he
came from sixteenth place.</i>
<i>Ayrton, do you feel like a World Champion now?</i>
I just feel peace.
It is as if someone had removed a huge weight
from my shoulders and head.
It is difficult to understand what
it means to be a World Champion.
He is an amazing person.
He is very humble,
and improves the image of Brazil abroad.
He shares his victory with us.
I admire him very much.
He's a very brave man.
That's all I know of him.
One of the few things we can still be proud of.
Once, I asked Ayrton:
"When will you think about quitting?"
He said, "Mum, the day I am
the champion I will stop."
In my heart, I knew that was not true.
We all know that.
<i>After the 1988 Championship,
after he won the title,</i>
<i>we noticed that he had changed between
the beginning and the end of the year.</i>
<i>Because he had found himself.</i>
<i>He had discovered who he was.</i>
<i>It was a process that reached
its conclusion after his championship victory.</i>
<i>At Christmas, many things happen,</i>
<i>new friends are made,</i>
like the person I'm about to introduce.
He was part of my 1988:
<i>Ayrton Senna!</i>
Isn't he cute?
I have a few questions for you.
I think everybody is excited,
but none more than me,
It is not easy to talk. Ayrton is now my friend.
Ayrton, what do you want for Christmas?
As a Christmas present?
What I really want, I cannot say here!
Why not?
It would be censored.
Let's say I just want to be happy.
Whisper it to me.
Happy New Year.
Happy 1990.
Happy '91.
Happy '92.
Happy '93.
Senna and Prost; Prost and Senna.
The order of the grid is always one or the other.
<i>It is a war between them.</i>
<i>For the French driver Alain Prost,</i>
he believes his teammate is unfair to him.
And these disagreements could
affect the rest of the season.
<i>Grand Prix after Grand Prix they were
more and more distant from each other.</i>
<i>Ayrton said: "This Frenchman is tough."</i>
<i>"He wants war."</i>
<i>After a little more time,</i>
<i>they became completely isolated
and they didn't speak anymore.</i>
I would like to give a warm welcome to
the President of FIA, Mr. Balestre.
<i>Prost is first. Senna, second.</i>
<i>Prost jumped into the lead,</i>
<i>his start was better.</i>
<i>Finally they clash! It goes in the favor of Prost.</i>
<i>If the race ends like this, Prost wins the title.</i>
<i>But, for Ayrton Senna it is a no win situation.</i>
<i>Nannini passes.</i>
<i>Nannini is now in the lead.</i>
<i>Senna is still in the pits.</i>
<i>Senna is back on track,
but he is far behind Nannini.</i>
<i>Catching up is almost impossible.</i>
<i>It's all or nothing, five laps to go.</i>
<i>It will be a suicidal race for Senna,
if he decides to try anything.</i>
<i>Then Prost saw Ayrton return to the race.</i>
<i>and immediately went to the stewards' office.</i>
<i>Nannini, first. Senna, second.</i>
<i>Senna tries to pass Nannini!</i>
<i>Senna is in the lead!</i>
<i>Waving Brazilian flags!</i>
<i>All stand up!</i>
<i>Ayrton Senna!</i>
<i>The checkered flag!</i>
<i>Senna celebrates in the cockpit!</i>
<i>He hits his helmet, the Brazilian Ayrton Senna!</i>
<i>Visibly moved,</i>
<i>he raises his visor and wipes away a tear.</i>
<i>It is a fantastic victory.</i>
<i>I have never seen anything like it.</i>
<i>There was no podium celebration
immediately after the race.</i>
<i>As the wait was prolonged, the more people feared
that the decision was becoming political.</i>
<i>The decision taken by the team</i>
of FIA Commissioners at the Grand Prix of Japan,
is to exclude the number one car
and its driver, Ayrton Senna,
from the final outcome of the race.
After the race, a giant screen has
repeatedly shown the incident
and everything that happened to
enable Senna's return to the track.
<i>After reviewing these images,
race officials have concluded</i>
<i>that Senna failed to use the
chicane to resume racing.</i>
<i>Senna has infringed Article 56
of the FIA regulations.</i>
The Court of Appeal pronounces
a six-month license suspension for Senna...
a warning not only to Ayrton
Senna but for all the drivers,
and a fine of $100,000.
Even if you're one of the best drivers in the world,
you have no right to cause stupid accidents.
<i>That was quite a profound
moment for Ayrton because,</i>
<i>Balestre had behaved
even worse than Prost.</i>
<i>He even thought about giving
up Formula One racing.</i>
<i>All drivers aspire towards their limits.</i>
My limit is different from that of Prost.
This is the reality.
Instead of trying to improve his own capacity,
he found it easier to attack me.
The fact that I believe in God,
the fact that I have faith in God,
is not to say that I am immortal,
It does not mean that I am immune
from... danger, as has been said.
I'm afraid of hurting myself
just like everyone else,
especially driving in Formula One,
where the threat is constant.
<i>If the race continues,
the title will have been decided.</i>
<i>The Championship is over.</i>
<i>Ayrton Senna is the World Champion of 1990.</i>
<i>Two of the greatest champions
in the history of Formula One</i>
<i>ended up in the sand, Championship ruined.</i>
<i>They accuse each other, but Prost was the hardest.</i>
<i>His reaction was violent.</i>
<i>I wanted to punch him in the face,
but I was so disgusted...</i>
that I did not succeed.
It makes me feel sick.
<i>The situation in Brazil was
very negative and depressing.</i>
<i>But many times, when Ayrton won,</i>
<i>instead of trying to hide
his Brazilian origins, as others did,</i>
<i>he did the opposite,
waving the flag of his country.</i>
<i>He took it inside the car every Sunday.</i>
<i>He was an inspiration to people.
That's why they loved him so much.</i>
<i>Ayrton had never won
the Grand Prix of Brazil.</i>
<i>Since he entered Formula One he always
dreamed of winning in his home country.</i>
<i>The Brazilian Grand Prix has begun!</i>
<i>Red light. Green light.</i>
<i>A good start.</i>
<i>Come on, Senna!</i>
<i>Senna is in command!</i>
<i>Here's Senna. It's starting to rain.</i>
<i>It's raining.</i>
<i>It seems impossible to drive a
Formula One car stuck in sixth gear.</i>
<i>Ayrton wanted to stop.
He could no longer drive it.</i>
<i>But he had already tried many times
to win the Brazilian Grand Prix</i>
<i>and found a special force within himself.</i>
<i>The last corner! And Senna crosses the line!</i>
<i>Go for the win!</i>
<i>Ayrton, Ayrton... The Brazilian Ayrton Senna!</i>
<i>In the lead from start to
finish, he wins at lnterlagos!</i>
<i>A wonderful victory for Senna!</i>
<i>I don't believe it! I don't believe it!</i>
<i>Fuck! Fucking hell!</i>
<i>He won and then fainted.</i>
<i>It was his most heroic moment.</i>
<i>Because of the tremendous physical effort,</i>
<i>I had muscle spasms of my shoulder and neck.</i>
<i>The pain was tremendous.</i>
<i>The physical and mental stress
this weekend was enormous.</i>
<i>But there could be only one result.</i>
<i>I finished the race with no more energy.</i>
Come here, Dad. Come on!
Come here!
Quiet, Ayrton.
Today, I fought hard.
I wanted to finish the race
and finish in first position,
because He is the greatest
and He will give me this race after all.
That's what happened.
It is God who gave me this race and I'm happy.
It was thrilling.
All hail the Brazilian Senna
for his victory. Congratulations.
I thank all of Brazil. I thank all the fans.
This weekend I felt so much warmth around me
that we could not do anything but win.
It could not have been any other way.
<i>And we did.</i>
<i>Ayrton was so well known in Brazil.</i>
<i>there were a lot of people asking for help</i>
<i>for personal problems. Sometimes hospitals</i>
<i>and charities sought his support and donations.</i>
<i>Ayrton gave donations and tried to work things out.</i>
<i>But did not want to make random donations.</i>
<i>He wanted to develop a whole thing,
something organized and structured</i>
<i>to help Brazil, especially the children.</i>
<i>Mansell tries to overtake,
but he goes straight on.</i>
<i>Mansell goes straight on!
Mansell goes straight on!</i>
<i>The Championship is over!</i>
<i>Mansell cannot get out of the gravel trap!</i>
<i>Ayrton Senna of Brazil!</i>
<i>Three-time Formula One World Champion!</i>
<i>A lifetime dedicated to this moment,</i>
<i>by a genius of international sport.</i>
<i>Three-time world champion
and many other titles ahead of him.</i>
<i>And only thirty-one years of age.</i>
<i>Thirty-three wins, three world titles.</i>
<i>Breaking record after record.</i>
<i>He celebrates as only Senna can do.</i>
<i>It is very special for me.</i>
<i>Thank you so much.</i>
I kissed the hand of Senna, the left hand
of Senna, three-times world champion.
I want to see Senna.
I want to hug him and kiss him.
I have got a box with
photos and newspaper articles.
Everything you can imagine.
He is the only good thing in Brazil, right?
<i>It is a wonderful party.</i>
<i>Anything goes. What matters is happiness.</i>
<i>Have you spoken about Formula One today?</i>
Formula One is too rigid. Today is Carnival.
Have any of your girls
ever told you: "Faster, Ayrton?"
Yes.
<i>Ayrton acheiving the third world title</i>
<i>was the culmination of a script
he had written for himself</i>
<i>well before entering Formula One,</i>
<i>because he knew he could do it
and could do even more.</i>
<i>The great idol of sport in Brazil.</i>
<i>With the third title, he became
the world's great sporting idol.</i>
The negotiations were lengthy,
and we still do not know who
will be Prost's teammate.
The three-time world champion has signed
a two-year contract with Williams,
and during the week will begin testing the car.
<i>I'm pretty sure of one thing:</i>
<i>I'm the one that has more to lose</i>
<i>if I had to stop for a year or more,</i>
because I'm at an age near the peak of my career
and the number of years in the career
of a Formula One driver is limited.
So if I stop, I'd lose out more than anyone else,
both professionally and personally.
<i>In 1993, Ayrton drove his car so brilliantly.</i>
<i>For me, it was his best season.</i>
<i>For Ayrton Senna it is a race against time.</i>
<i>He has to attune himself to be an integral
part of the team and adapt to the new car.</i>
<i>He says he is not yet comfortable.</i>
The car no longer has the electronic
components used last year.
He is without traction control, special
brakes and active suspension.
The cars are much less stable
without the electronically controlled suspension.
As a result, they are more difficult to drive
<i>and it is very likely that more
cars will leave the track.</i>
<i>So we might see more cars crashing,
giving more excitement to the audience.</i>
Also for us, as long as nothing
happens to the drivers.
Otherwise, it is not a good situation.
<i>Senna was so nervous that weekend.
I had never seen him so tense.</i>
<i>I never saw him smile, even for a moment.</i>
<i>He maintained a bemused,
bored, even a sad demeanour.</i>
Do you know Ayrton or should I introduce you?
No, I already met him.
Knew him by name or in person?
I know him because I follow
Formula One and then we met in person.
Why are you so nervous, then?
When we stand next to a person like
him we always become emotional.
<i>Good luck to the champion and the future champion.</i>
<i>That Saturday, at dinner,
Frank Williams was not at all sure</i>
<i>that Senna would be present on the grid.</i>
<i>I was sure that he did not want to compete.</i>
<i>On that morning, when he awoke,</i>
<i>he asked God to speak to him.</i>
<i>He opened the Bible and read a passage that said</i>
<i>God would give him the greatest gift of all,</i>
<i>that of God himself.</i>
<i>A collision!</i>
<i>Everyone swerves around. Look at that.</i>
<i>Lamy arrives at full speed.</i>
<i>And there is Lehto.</i>
<i>A nasty collision,
Lamy and Lehto are very lucky.</i>
<i>The safety car goes on track.</i>
<i>The safety car's lights are off,</i>
<i>which means it's about to go into the pits.</i>
<i>Starting again, Senna is in the lead.</i>
<i>Schumacher is second.</i>
<i>On the sixth lap, Michael Schumacher is
trying to put pressure on Senna.</i>
<i>Senna crashes hard!</i>
<i>At the Tamburello curve.</i>
<i>A very serious accident.</i>
<i>What was the cause?</i>
<i>In my opinion the steering column broke</i>
<i>and the car became uncontrollable.</i>
<i>But above all, it was fatal because</i>
<i>the car crashed at the exact angle
for the suspension shaft</i>
<i>to hit his helmet.</i>
He was my idol.
He represented the best of Brazil.
<i>I miss you, Senna.</i>
I will never forget you.
<i>Brazilians need food, education,</i>
health, and a little joy,
and now that joy is gone.
NOTHING CAN SEPARATE ME
FROM THE LOVE OF GOD.
