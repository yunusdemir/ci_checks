- (children chattering)
Guys, settle down.
Settle down, you guys.
Who just threw that?
I'll throw something
back at you.
No, no more soda,
you guys are crazy.
Taxi, taxi!
No, no, I got that.
I got that.
- Sorry, pal.
- Woman: It's okay...
(horns honking)
You're stupid!
That's just stupid!
Hey, motherfucker!
Where's the wallet?
Woman: Give me that cake.
Where's Paul?
- Maurice?
- Oh shit, Mr. Duncan.
You know this dude?
I had Maurice
in my ninth grade bio class
about five years ago.
I guess those extra help sessions
didn't quite do it for you.
Let's go, man.
This guy's cool.
He's the best teacher I ever had.
Let's go.
Sorry about this,
Mr. Duncan.
Honest mistake.
Paul:
Got things under control?
Paul, what took you
so long?
I ran into an old student,
I got held up.
- Mm-hmm, did you get the present?
- Yeah, yeah, voila.
Gorgeous.
All right,
let's do this.
Clara, get the lights.
- Finally.
- I know.
Ready?
Everybody, everybody!
How you doin', Jeff?
Paul: Where is he?
Where's my boy?
- Hey!
- Dad.
All:
"happy birthday to you"
How, you doin'?
"Happy birthday to you"
"Happy birthday,
dear Adam"
"Happy birthday to you!"
- Hey, kid!
- You made me laugh.
(kids screaming)
(screams and applause)
So Dorset Prep,
where is that exactly?
- Mars.
- Oh, that's hilarious.
It's in the suburbs,
a half hour away.
It's a great offer,
but Paul hasn't made up his mind yet.
I bet that's a change from the school
you teach at now.
Oh yeah, less crack,
better cafeteria selection.
Don't mind Paul. He's still grappling
with his conscience.
Mom, Dad, this is
the coolest present ever!
Oh-ho,
it looks good too, right?
Do you think
he needs more sugar?
Yeah I know,
I'm breaking every rule.
- Hello, is Steggie in here?
- Beware.
Hey, cake for Steggie.
- He can't eat that, it...
- Why not?
He's an herbivore.
Oh, oh,
he's an herbivore.
Okay, then
I'll just take it back.
- Wait, maybe leave it, just in case.
- Take it back.
- That's what I thought.
- Good night.
- Bye, Dad.
- Good birthday?
- Yeah.
- All right.
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night.
What was your
favorite present?
- My jacket...
- Yay!
...You got me.
- You look so good in red.
What's on your agenda
tomorrow?
Uh, I have to stop
by the gallery.
I have to pick up
a lens I ordered.
I have to get a new pair
of sneakers for Adam.
Ooh, I have to do you.
I could take care
of that right now.
Have you thought
about that job offer?
You do realize
it'd mean moving, right?
(both sighing)
So, we'd move.
You know we used to think
we were pretty hip living down here.
I also used to think four Merit Lights
and a Diet Coke constituted a meal.
Honey, I love this place as much as you
do, but we've got a kid to think about.
And I just don't think any city is
a great place to raise a kid these days.
Plus, you'd be making twice
what you're making now.
I'm just not sure the timing's right and
your photography is starting to take.
This is not about
my photography.
Okay, I just can't shake this feeling
that somehow...
I'd be selling out.
Right. Listen...
you know how much
I respect your ethics.
But this is about Adam.
Sometimes, ethics
have to take a back seat.
Jessie:
Okay, your turn.
- Okay, I'm going to a picnic...
- Yeah?
And I'm going
to bring an ant,
a bagel,
a croissant,
- a ding dong...
- Like you?
- Mom!
- (chuckles)
- A ding dong...
- Yeah?
- Uh...
- Shoe store, 3:00!
- Yes!
- Take my hand.
(air pumping)
I think if you pump them any more,
they might explode.
Really?
- (pumping)
- Kaboom!
- Do you want 'em or not?
- Yeah.
- Do you want this?
- Yeah.
I'm just gonna go
test these outside, okay?
Okay, but don't go
too far, okay?
And how would you like
to pay for this?
A credit card, please.
- (reverse signal beeping)
- (jackhammer rattling)
Ma'am?
I need your signature.
Sorry, so sorry.
All right, sorry.
- (beeping continues)
- (jackhammer continues)
- Thanks.
- Great.
- (tires screeching)
- (horns blaring)
(gasps)
Paul: Hello!
You guys!
Where's
my greeting committee?
Jess?
I'm sorry, I got stuck
at a teacher's conference.
Jessie?
Machine voice:
You have four new messages.
(Jessie, sobbing)
Paul, l...
(beeps)
(dial tone)
(sobbing)
God damn it!
(crow cawing)
We'll handle all
the funeral arrangements.
- God be with you.
- Thank you for everything, father.
Honey?
Excuse me, Jessie?
Jessie Duncan?
Yeah?
It's Richard,
Richard Wells.
Richard?
Your wife was an undergraduate
student of mine. It's been years.
Actually, Richard, it's...
it's kind of a bad time.
I know, I read about it in the paper.
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
- Thank you.
- Actually, do you have a minute?
I'm sorry,
I know this is a terrible time.
I don't think so.
Not right now.
But believe me,
if there was any other way...
The truth is, I went
to some trouble to find you.
I'd like to help you.
Help us?
I'm a doctor.
I specialize in fertility.
If we could just talk,
it won't take long, I promise you.
We can go to a restaurant
right over there.
Richard: I finished the residency in
ob-gyn, but my real passion is research.
- What is it you do, Paul?
- I teach biology.
- You do?
- Can you tell us what this is about?
Yeah.
The truth is,
there is...
there's no easy way
to present this to you,
so I'm just gonna
come out and say it.
My clinic has perfected a procedure
by which a single cell
could be used to create
a genetically-identical fetus...
a fetus which could be carried to term
and, in effect, be reborn.
- Do you mean cloned?
- Yes.
Yes. Yes.
This would be
the identical boy
down to the last chromosome
on the last hair of his head.
This is how
you wanna help us?
I used to be affiliated
with a hospital here
and I had a chance
to review Jessie's records.
You did what?
I'm aware of the complications
surrounding Adam's delivery,
that it's impossible
for you to conceive again.
You looked at her records?
I had to be certain
that Jessie's condition
didn't preclude carrying a child and
it doesn't, so yes, I can help you.
You can have him back, your son Adam,
to birth again, to raise.
- Adam's dead, God damn it!
- Paul. Paul.
- My son is dead!
- Paul, please.
You come at me with this?
God knows what hell
you've been through.
The last thing I want to do
is make this time any harder.
But the truth is I can do this,
and I want you to know.
What you're talking about is illegal,
not to mention potentially immoral.
Illegal, yes.
Immoral, no.
We're talking about using life
to create life, that's all.
And you've done this before? You've
successfully cloned a human being?
No, I haven't but only
because I've been looking
for an ideal candidate.
I read about what happened.
And I hope that if you two
aren't interested
- in what I'm proposing here...
- What are you proposing here?
- He's not even sure that he can...
- That's not true... I am sure.
Still, it does
come down to trust.
- You'd be...
- Excuse me, your menus.
You'd be gambling on me
as much as I'd be gambling on you.
My clinic is some
300 miles from here.
If you were to do this,
it would mean moving there
and I'll be honest with you,
changing your lives entirely.
Paul's right,
this is extremely against the law.
You'd have to sever
all ties with family,
with friends, with anyone
who ever knew Adam.
Of course I would help
with the relocation,
and I can get you a job
at the local high school.
- You know what, I've heard enough.
- Paul, please.
- I know how upsetting this is.
- No, no, no, you don't know!
You could never know.
- Let's go!
- You're right.
I'm sorry
to have upset you.
- Jessie...
- Jessie!
I can be reached
at this number.
- DNA can be saved indefinitely...
- Jessie!
But Adam's cells will only be viable
another 72 hours.
So if you do change
your mind...
Practically a stranger.
I can't believe you're considering this!
I can't believe you're
not considering this.
Any idea how much
could go wrong?
Honey, l... listen,
I love you, I love you.
I love you
beyond words, okay?
But only the tiniest thing has to go
wrong and so much has to go right.
But what if it did?
It still wouldn't be Adam.
It would be an identical twin.
It'd be like another kid.
But he'd have the same face
and the same laugh.
- In time, we can try again, I swear.
- No, we can't.
- You know we can't.
- We'll find a way. We can have...
I don't want another child!
I want Adam!
I want him back.
(sobbing)
You know what I kept thinking
while I was waiting for paramedics...
and he was in my arms...
and I was watching him die?
"This is the last time
I'll ever get to hold him."
My little boy.
(telephone ringing)
- Hello.
- Man: Paul.
l... I just heard.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, yeah.
Thank you, Sam.
Um... so...
how's Jessie
taking all this?
Actually, she's...
she's not so well.
Right, of course.
Look, would you please just
pass on my condolences to her?
Yeah, I will.
Hey, Sam, can l...
can I ask you something?
Have you ever heard
of a doctor named Richard Wells?
Richard Wells.
Sure I've heard of him. Why do you ask?
He was an old teacher
of Jessie's.
Really? He's
the stuff of legend.
He was doing really advanced
work on gene mapping.
We're talking
way ahead of his time.
Anyway,
last thing I heard,
he sold his findings to a huge firm,
made a ridiculous amount of money,
and then just sort of dropped out
of the game entirely.
Every once in a while I come across
an article of his in a journal,
consistently brilliant.
Like I said, he's...
A genius.
Yeah, I know.
- Paul, I'm so very sorry.
- Okay, thanks.
- Adam: Or you go like that.
- (Jessie singing)
(Jessie and Adam laughing)
Adam: One...
- (Jessie laughing)
- Paul: Oh, ooh!
Can't you see this?
Paul: Three, two, one.
The game is live!
- Paul: Then all of a sudden...
- I'm right side up!
Wait a second,
you're confusing me.
Do you think
that's a good idea?
No, I think
we should call it Adam.
- Adam: Guess who?
- Paul: I don't know.
- It's me, Adam.
- I don't think I know an Adam.
- I'm your son.
- (Paul laughing)
- Paul: Ow! Ow!
- Jessie: The family jewels.
Jessie:
Are we all in?
- Paul: Damn, what a handsome group.
- Adam: Yep.
- Paul: Hi, Mom!
- Jessie: Adam!
- Adam: Hello...
- Paul: This hat.
I've never seen you
wear this before.
Bad hair day,
I guess.
I've never seen you
wear any hat.
Richard: All cells are
in essence clones...
identical copies
of one original cell.
The key to artificially
stimulating replication
is in shocking a specialized cell
back to its pre-specialized state...
its stem cell precursor...
The cell as it was before it became
a liver cell or a brain cell,
or a relatively simpler
cheek cell.
Once in this state, the cell's nucleus
is immediately transferred
to a mother's
enucleated egg.
The transfer completed,
the egg cell will then
ideally accept the donor
nucleus as its own.
At which point,
we let nature take its course.
She did great.
We just need to keep her here until
tomorrow to make sure the implant takes.
But she did wonderfully.
She has to lie down
for at least an hour,
so why don't we go look at the house
and I'll show you around?
She's in good hands.
So, all these people
and no one else knows?
The procedure doesn't differ
much from a standard implant.
So, as far as
my staff's concerned,
Jessie's being treated as a high-risk
in vitro, nothing more.
- Dr. Wells?
- Thanks, George.
There you go.
Riverton's a great town, I think
you're really gonna like it here.
It's a bit secluded maybe,
but a wonderful community.
Nice people,
lots of families...
perfect place
to raise a child.
So why don't you follow me?
I'll show you around.
Richard:
Beautiful country, isn't it?
This whole area
has a lot of history.
And the house itself
is 100 years old at least.
Sorry, there's no furniture.
So I took the liberty of ordering some.
It should be here
sometime tomorrow.
What if this didn't work,
Richard?
What if the implant doesn't take,
the procedure's a bust... what then?
- It'll work, Paul.
- You can't say that with any certainty.
Look, no one can say anything
with any certainty.
I mean, even a routine
pregnancy is fallible.
But if I can speak plainly,
what more do you have to lose?
Her. Jessie.
She's pinned every hope
in the world on this.
And I won't let her down, or you.
You have my word on that.
Is this for real?
For now.
Jessie:
I can't believe this place.
Hey.
- Look at this.
- What is that?
Oh my God, Paul.
You know what
we could put down here?
Darkroom?
- How are you feeling?
- I'm okay.
Jessie!
Hon? I'm back.
I'm home to our...
big home!
Hey!
Hi.
You said we'd never
have a party in here.
- (screaming)
- Come on.
- Come on, come on, push it.
- I can't!
- Yes.
- No, it hurts.
- Yes.
- Richard: You're doing fine, Jessie.
You're fully dilated, the head's already
crowning, you just need to now push.
- Something's wrong.
- No, nothing is wrong.
Something's wrong,
I'm telling you.
It's coming out. It's fine.
You can see the head.
- Nurse: Keep pushing. Push, push, push.
- (Jessie groaning)
- Richard: Keep pushing, push.
- Nurse: Good girl.
- Richard: Come on, push, push, push.
- Come on, come on.
Oh, there we go, okay.
All right, all right,
we're out, we're out.
- That's it.
- (Jessie panting)
It's okay.
Let me just hear you...
let me just hear you scream.
- Paul: You did great.
- Come on, come on.
(panting)
That's great, honey.
He's all right.
It's great.
I just need
some breath from him.
He's all right.
Richard:
Okay, how long?
Nurse:
30 seconds, 31, 32...
33, 34, 35...
- 36, 37...
- We're gonna have to bag him.
- 38, 39...
- Paul: What's wrong?
- 40 seconds, 41...
- 40...
- 42, 43...
- Come on, come on.
- Both: 44...
- (baby crying)
(chuckles)
Oh, baby.
Oh, baby, thank God.
This is the same
as last time, remember?
It's him. You wanted
to give us a scare, didn't you?
Oh, thank you, God.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Here you go, kiddo.
Good night, Adam.
My little boy.
I still think
it's a little strange.
Huh-uh.
It's his name.
It's always been
his name... Adam.
"...Birthday to you"
"Happy birthday to you"
"Happy birthday,
dear Adam"
"Happy birthday to you!"
(all screaming)
There you go, buddy.
Uncle Richard!
Happy birthday, Adam.
Jessie: Cake, cake, cake!
Cake time! Cake!
Richard:
So, how's work going?
Paul: It's good. It's good...
nice kids, bright too.
I don't know, sometimes
I feel like I'm teaching fish to swim...
at a Club Med.
You don't still miss
your old school?
No, it's more like
I miss missing it.
Uncle Richard,
want to help me fly it?
Richard:
Let's get it up there.
Keep it away
from the trees.
So what was
this word you said?
Reeservoier.
It's a science word, Uncle Richard.
We've been learning about
natural resources in school.
Oh, you mean
a "reservoir."
Well, that's a lot like a lake,
only it's a man-made lake.
But I thought God
made everything.
Well, in a way He did,
if you believe He created
those people who figured out
how to make a reservoir, right?
- Jessie: Bye, guys, thank you.
- Boy #1: See you later, Adam!
- Man: Thanks, Paul, see you later.
- Hey, kiddo!
Boy #1: Bye, Adam!
Why don't you come on inside,
say goodbye to your friends?
Boy #2:
Thank you, Adam.
Boy #3:
Bye, Adam!
- Bye.
- Bye, Paul.
Girl: Adam!
Bye!
Hey!
Birthday Boy!
How many times
I gotta tell you,
you can't leave
your toys around?
Somebody's
gonna trip and...
(chuckles)
For those of us who don't wear
helmets in the house...
What you doing?
Where did you get this?
It was a birthday present
from Joey Smoyer.
Do you like it?
Yeah.
Why don't you
get some sleep?
Dad, I've been thinking...
About what?
I don't think I like you
so much anymore.
- No...
- Gotcha!
Ohh, somebody is in
some very serious trouble.
Where do you think you're going?
Where do you think you're going?
- I'm gonna smother you now.
- Stop it, Dad!
(water running)
It's just in...
some ways,
he's so much the same,
you know?
But he's still
his own person entirely.
And then...
Iook at him.
I honestly forget
sometimes, you know?
And then something
like that...
that toy dinosaur thing
will happen.
Jessie: It's okay,
it happens to me too.
- I just worry, you know?
- What?
- If he ever found out.
- He won't find out.
What if he did?
About what it would
mean to him.
I just love him so much.
Both of you.
Meow!
(laughing)
(groaning)
(children chanting)
(both moaning)
(floor creaks)
No!
No! Help!
- (laughter)
- Paul: Adam!
- (knocking)
- Adam!
It's okay,
I'm right here.
Adam:
Who are you?
Dad!
- Adam!
- No.
Mom!
Adam?
Oh my God!
Adam!
(panting)
(screams)
Ow!
- Jesus, take it easy!
- Go away!
- It's okay, okay!
- No!
- It's okay, take it easy.
- Stay away! Get away!
- Jessie! It's okay.
- Get away from me!
- It's okay! Okay, okay!
- Get off!
- All right! It's okay.
- Get off me.
- Jessie!
- Honey?!
- Adam: Ow!
- Oh, God!
- Adam? Adam?
- What happened?
I don't know,
he just collapsed.
- Call 911!
- I'm calling Richard.
(heart monitor beeping)
Paul: Richard, thank God.
I want him in a hospital.
Paul, my staff and I
can handle this.
Your staff don't even
know about this.
They don't need to.
It's the same as always...
we're close friends.
You know our arrangement.
Maybe we need to reconsider
our arrangement.
It's five hours,
he's still unconscious.
His respiration and color are good and
he's responding to low-level stimuli.
He's basically
just sleeping.
Except for some reason,
he's not waking up.
- He seems to have night terrors.
- Night terrors?
It's a sleep disorder.
A child screams in his sleep.
He may sit up, walk, even talk, but
all attempts to wake him are futile.
No, no, you weren't there.
This is something entirely different.
All right...
hold on a minute.
I know it's scary,
but we talked about this...
the possibility
that things could change
once Adam crossed the age
at which he died.
Well, it's been eight years.
As of now, he's crossed it.
You said things could change...
you never said anything like this.
Because I couldn't
have known.
Look, he is
the only one, period.
We are and always have been
at the mercy of that fact.
Up to this point, we've had a map...
Adam's first eight years.
But now we're entering
uncharted territory.
We have no way of knowing
who the Adam of age nine, age 10,
age 50,
is going to be,
what problems he may
or may not have.
I promise you, there's nothing more
a hospital would be doing for him.
What's happening
here, Richard?
That's what I'd like to find out.
My feeling is it's probably nothing.
Let's just give it
a little time, okay?
Yeah.
The last eight years...
no matter how happy
I've been,
I've always had this feeling that
somehow we wouldn't get away with this.
Not that someone
would find out,
just...
somehow,
we'd lose him again.
We're not gonna lose him.
We're not gonna lose him.
It's okay, it's okay.
(heart monitor beeping)
- (children laughing)
- (screams)
Boo!
- Oh, Adam!
- Oh my gosh!
- Hey.
- But no, no, no... is he all right?
- He's fine.
- You okay?
I'm feeling hungry!
- (laughing)
- Mommy!
- Come on, kiddo.
- Everything's okay.
This is fantastic, fantastic.
Come on, come on.
(both grunting)
- You feel good?
- Adam: Ahh!
My God,
you slept enough.
- Richard, thank you.
- I'll see you all tomorrow.
(birds chirping)
Paul:
Adam, dinner's on.
Jessie,
he's not up here.
Paul: Adam!
Hey, come on.
Adam!
Hey!
Adam?
Adam? Adam!
Adam?
There you are.
What are you doing here?
Didn't you hear me
calling you?
Hey...
are you all right?
I'm talking to you.
Adam?
Hey, I'm talking to you.
Hey!
Answer me.
Yes, Daddy?
Did you hear me calling you?
Your dinner is ready.
Go in the house.
(chains rattling)
Jessie: No, Paul just said it was
kind of a strange moment.
No, he seems fine.
Yeah, that's what I'm hoping...
it's probably nothing.
I don't think it's anything
to worry about, okay?
All right, take care
and I'll see you soon.
All right, well, thanks,
Richard. Take care.
I think we should
take him to a specialist.
Richard doesn't think
it's anything to worry about.
And his word's gospel?
How long are we supposed
to live like this?
When does
all this gratitude end?
(children chattering)
- You sure you're okay?
- Yeah.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
Bye, Mom.
- (door slams)
- (chatter)
(chatter intensifies)
- (screeching)
- Anybody know what this is?
It's a big ugly visual aide.
Let's do it like this.
If you think of DNA
as a fuse box,
aach of the genes are either
switched on or off,
depending on which cell
we're talking about.
So that the genes responsible
for say the length of Kevin's...
(chuckles)
...nose hair wouldn't be
much use in his pinky toe.
So what, the gene
isn't present?
No, no, it's present,
it's just inactive. It's turned off.
It's dead.
You know what?
Why don't you just
take a look at chapter 11
for the rest of the period
and then, you know, go?
(door closes)
Boy #1: I'm going to put on
a little show for you guys
and you're going
to pay me your lunch money.
So pay me and if you don't,
I'll beat the crap out of you
for the rest of your life.
Boy #2:
How about this? No.
Boy #1:
How about... yes! Ha-ha!
What are you going to do about it, huh?
You're a tiny little boy.
What if his having outlived
the life of that first original cell
has somehow allowed some dormant
problem to be switched on?
Listen, maybe it's significant,
maybe it isn't,
But the fact remains that any changes
in health or behavior
Could have occurred
naturally the last time as well.
- These night terrors...
- If that's what they are.
Paul, it's a common
sleep disorder.
If there's anything
he isn't, it's common.
What do you want me
to say, Paul?
That there's something
seriously wrong with him?
- You don't think I'm just as concerned?
- No. No, I don't.
You have every right to worry.
But for eight years,
we've known what to expect.
Most parents never have
the benefit of hindsight.
From now on,
neither do we.
- "We"?
- You know what I meant.
Can I get back
to my patients, please?
Ever want to have any children
of your own, Richard?
Jessie's always saying
how great you are with Adam.
- It seems like such a shame.
- Paul, he's your son.
Believe me, I know
what he means to you.
But maybe you can keep in mind
what he does mean to me.
- Mother: Here they come.
- Jessie: Oh, hey there! There you are.
Jessie:
Why so glum, chum?
Adam: There's this new kid,
Roy Hazen,
he's always showing off,
like how high he goes
on the swings and stuff.
- He's a total ass wipe.
- Hey!
Where did you learn
that language?
I don't know.
I don't like it.
Get in the car.
- Whoa!
- (tires screeching)
- Oh, God!
- Adam.
- Are you all right? Are you all right?
- I'm fine.
- Adam!
- I didn't see you.
I'm sorry.
Oh, God, I didn't see you.
I came so close to hitting you.
Do you know that?
Do you know you could have
been killed just now? Do you?
- How many times do I got to tell you...
- Daddy, you're hurting me!
- to keep your bicycle off the street?
- Paul!
What's the matter with you?
- You okay, honey?
- Yes.
You sure?
(cell phone ringing)
Hello?
Yeah, I would, actually.
Let me get a pen.
Dr. Lieber?
Okay. In Beauford?
Great.
Sam, I appreciate this.
Talk to you soon. Bye.
Who's that?
Wrong number.
(door squeaks open)
(floor creaking)
Paul: Adam!
(gasps)
Adam?
Adam, open the door.
Open the door, son.
Open the door!
Adam?
Open the door.
God damn it!
Open the door, son.
- (shrieks)
- (screams)
(screams)
What...
why is the door locked?
- What?
- How... the curtain.
- What?
- The curtain. He was under there.
No, no, no, no, look.
What are you talking about?
- Look, it's fine.
- No, no.
Don't let him hurt me.
Shh, there's nobody
going to hurt you.
Look, look, look, it's okay.
Shh, calm down.
It's all right. I think you just
had a bad dream.
- No.
- Huh?
- I saw it.
- What?
What did you see?
Adam, talk to me.
Please.
Please, you got to talk to me. I can't
help you if I don't know what this is.
I just... I know something.
Okay, what?
What is it?
Something bad
is going to happen.
No, it's not.
I'll never let anything bad
ever happen to you.
Not to me.
Listen to me, you're my son,
you understand that?
Huh?
- Say it.
- I'm your son.
That's right.
We're gonna be okay.
We're going to be okay.
Doctor: So, how many eggs
did you retrieve?
I only retrieved three.
I thought that would be enough...
- Richard, hi.
- Hi.
I'm sorry
if this is a bad time.
No, it's fine.
- Excuse us.
- Sure.
What's the matter?
You look...
I need to speak with you
about something...
I have to stop off
at home for some papers.
Why don't I fix us
some lunch?
(children chattering)
Hey, hey,
how would you like that?
I just got an idea.
How about we have
a swinging contest?
- All: Yeah!
- You guys will be the judges.
- We'll make it very fair.
- Yeah.
Ladies first.
Ha ha.
Don't go too high,
you'll start crying.
Don't break a nail,
oh, no!
- Come on, you chicken.
- (spitting)
- Oh, what's that for?
- Nasty monkey.
Adam Duncan, you stop that at once!
No spitting.
Come on, come down
from there.
Come down.
Come down right now.
No... hey!
- (kids laughing)
- Hey...
Adam?
So what you're saying,
these nightmares
might have started
at this age anyway?
Or possibly triggered
by any number of things...
school, stress,
tension at home.
Yeah, well...
Paul is convinced that
somehow Adam's cells have...
Retained memories
of his first life?
There's an often cited
experiment...
a rat was trained
to run a maze,
killed, then ground up
and fed to a second rat.
The second rat, when presented
with the same maze,
completed it
in record time,
proving that memory lived on
in those ingested cells.
It's fascinating, really,
also a bunch of nonsense...
an urban legend.
So, it's not possible
he's remembering?
No, no.
Thank God.
Frankly, I'm more
concerned about Paul's
working up
these strange theories.
Paul is just having
a tough time right now.
It's good.
He's never felt as comfortable here
as you, has he?
No.
You don't think he'd
ever try to leave, do you?
Jessie, that can't happen.
Out here
in the middle of nowhere,
it's easy to forget the consequences
of what we've done.
But if anyone
ever found out,
you might
never see Adam again.
I know.
I can trust you
to rein Paul in?
Yes.
Woman: Okay, well, I'll go ahead
and see if the auditorium's available.
Right.
Sorry, I just got
the message.
They called me
at the high school.
Apparently,
they couldn't reach you?
- I was out. How's Adam?
- He's fine, Mrs. Duncan.
I have him waiting
in my office right now.
I don't know exactly
how to say this, but...
his behavior has distanced
some of the other children.
And the thing is, he could have
seriously injured himself.
Let's go in
and see him, okay?
Is that wine
on your breath?
- I was having lunch.
- With who?
Jessie:
Why are you so upset?
It was just lunch.
I just wanted to talk to him
about Adam.
God, Paul.
Wait, where are we going?
To get a second opinion.
Are you kidding me?
Am I smiling?
Lieber:
About these night terrors...
you're confident
that's what this is?
I see it in a number
of kids Adam's age.
Scares the bejesus out of the parents,
but the kids outgrow it.
As for Adam's recent changes
in behavior, well, he's poorly rested...
No, you don't know him.
This is something else.
He won't leave me alone.
- Lieber: Who?
- Adam: Zachary.
Zachary?!
Mr. Duncan, who is Zachary?
Is he a boy in his class?
I don't know.
Honey, who is Zachary?
He's the boy
who lives in my dreams.
Paul: Talk to me, pal. This boy
told you his name was Zachary?
Not really,
I kind of just know.
And you've never
seen his face?
He doesn't like
to show it,
but I know
because of his jacket.
What kind of jacket?
Just let him answer.
It's red with white sleeves.
Adam: Where are we going?
Where are we going?
Where's who going, Adam?
- Adam?
- Zachary.
Zachary?
- And where are you?
- Where we live.
I don't want to do this.
This is crazy.
According to who?
Richard?
Listen, there's something
he's not telling us, Jessie, I know it.
The way he is handling this,
the way he stays so close to us.
- He cares about us.
- I don't...
Zachary, Zachary,
where are you?
- Tell me about Zachary.
- He's never even known a Zachary.
What are you trying
to tell us, Adam? Say it.
- (mumbling)
- Say it!
- That's enough, stop it.
- Tell us what you're trying to say.
If you don't understand it,
how do you expect to beat it?
- I don't want to understand it.
- You're dead!
- (truck horn blaring)
- Paul, watch out!
(tires screeching)
(panting)
Are you okay?
Honey, you okay?
- Is he all right?
- He's okay.
You're all right,
you're okay.
(panting)
I'm sorry.
Okay, kiddo,
there you go.
You're home now,
all right?
You just go to sleep,
all right?
Dad...
did I die?
Of course not.
You've been
right here with us.
Go to sleep.
Oh my God,
that's what this is.
He's remembering
his first life in his dreams.
- Kids say things like that.
- A boy? In the city?
Jesus, it's possible.
If certain genes from the cell
used in the procedure
managed to retain
certain memories...
- He's not remembering.
- How can you say that?
Because he can't.
(door squeaks)
Honey, wake up.
We're at school.
Female teacher: Okay now, I want
to see everyone in your family
outside your houses
in the pictures, okay?
Take your time.
Lots of colors.
And don't forget
to write your name on it.
Nice and big. I want to put these up
around the classroom.
Beautiful.
You can put pets
in your pictures...
dogs and cats.
Have some fun.
- Hi, Pat.
- Hi, Jessie.
I just thought I'd stop by
to see how the stuff's doing.
Come in.
Very well. Richard Wells
was in yesterday.
He bought this big one and
these three small ones on the spot.
- That's great.
- (cell phone rings)
Excuse me a second.
Hello.
- Hi.
- Richard, hi.
I just thought I'd see
how Adam's doing.
Not so well, actually.
He had another
night terror last night.
Paul even managed
to get him talking this time.
I'm wondering
if we can use his ability
to vocalize in that
state to our advantage.
I don't know.
What would that entail?
Well, for starters, I'd like you
to bring him in again.
I'm not sure Paul would be
comfortable with that.
But I thought we agreed
you're gonna try to rein him in.
- I know we did. I'll talk to him, okay?
- Please do.
I need to go, Richard.
Good bye.
(children yelling)
Come on, you guys,
let's go!
Come on, you chickens!
Wussies! Let's go!
I'm doing it!
You can too!
Are you afraid of something?
Let's go!
Come on, let's go!
Jeez, buddy!
Let's go!
Come on, come on!
Come on, I'm doing it!
You can!
What are you, babies?
You want your ba-ba? Let's go!
(steel balls clanging)
(clanging continues)
Who's there?
Oh, no.
(children laughing)
Please be okay.
Please don't touch this.
(Adam, Paul and Jessie
laughing)
Jessie?
You down there?
- Did you hear me?
- Huh?
- You okay?
- Are you hungry?
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Dad.
Yeah.
You hungry?
- (telephone ringing)
- Jessie: Hello?
No, I'm sorry, Tanya,
he isn't.
Tanya, slow down.
Hold on, I'll ask him
right now. Hold on.
Adam, roy's mother says
he hasn't come home from school yet.
- Do you know where he might be?
- No.
Wait, wait, wait.
What were you doing down
at the river this afternoon?
Just playing.
With who?
I'm not supposed to say.
Adam, can you answer me?
Go to your room.
Now!
I'm sorry, Tanya,
he doesn't know.
Yeah, good luck.
You said Richard mentioned
using his ability
to vocalize
to find out more.
Call him.
We'll bring Adam in tomorrow.
Adam, what's the name
of the school?
Can you tell me
the name of the school?
(mumbles)
Pius...
S-s-street.
Could it be
Saint Pius?
Are you sure this
can't hurt him?
It's a mild tranquilizer.
We're just poking around
to see what we dig up.
Right Paul?
Yeah.
Adam...
is Zachary in there?
In school?
They all are.
(children laughing)
They all are.
Are you sure
you wanna do this?
Z-zachary.
Clark.
Adam:
Z-zach...
We know this name?
Zachary Clark?
Paul:
Who is Zachary Clark?
(match ignites)
(girls screaming)
They think I'm him.
Are you him?
Are you Zachary?
Who are you?
They think I'm him.
- (laughing)
- They think I'm him!
(laughing)
They think I'm him!
- They think I'm him!
- (girl screaming)
- Adam: No!
- Paul: Adam!
- Adam?
- Jessie: Richard, release him.
- It's hurting him.
- Adam? Wake up.
- Adam: Hot! Hot!
- Paul: Wake up, honey. Adam?
Goddamn it,
do something! Adam?
(screaming)
- Adam: Hot! Hot!
- Adam, wake up. Adam?
- Zachary?
- (breathing slows)
Honey?
- Daddy?
- Yeah.
Paul:
You're okay. You're okay.
Paul:
Hey, why'd you call him Zachary?
Answer me, Richard.
Because he wasn't responding
to his own name.
That's bullshit!
I want the truth.
- You set me up!
- It's okay, it's okay.
You needed my okay to push him,
but you wanted him pushed. Why?
- Paul, you've gone completely...
- Stop telling me what's wrong with me,
and tell me what's wrong
with my goddamn son!
Paul...
I wish I could help you.
Adam's changing.
He's getting worse.
Sometimes it's like
there's two of him.
He's destructive.
He's tried to harm himself.
The other kids at school
are scared of him, Richard.
(sighs)
There's something
you're not telling us.
There have been times
I've seen you talking to him
and he's in that same blank state,
but he listens to you, doesn't he, huh?
Don't push me, Richard.
Adam's all I care about
in the whole world.
I'll go public if I don't get some
answers soon, you understand that?
You understand I'll go public?
I'm not kidding.
I swear to God, I'll tell the whole
goddamn world what you've done.
What we've done, Paul.
What we've done.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe he is remembering.
Or maybe it's
something else.
Why that name,
Zachary Clark, or the school?
Look, I have tomorrow off,
It's a few hours drive
into the city.
- I'm gonna look into it.
- No, Paul, absolutely not.
- If Richard found out...
- He won't. I'll leave in the morning.
- I won't be back until afternoon.
- Paul, no.
Hold on.
(police radio chatter)
Woman:
No! No!
(woman sobbing)
Woman:
Let me go! Let me go!
Woman:
Nooo! No!
My baby!
Woman:
Let me go! Let me go!
No! My baby!
My baby!
My baby!
My baby!
No! No! My baby!
Paul:
Jessie, can I see you? Now?
I told you.
(whispering)
What? It doesn't mean...
You're the one who said he never
got along with that boy.
The twins said they saw Roy
playing down by the water,
that he'd been showing off.
They're all but sure
he fell in. You're not?
I'm not sure of
anything right now.
No matter what he does,
he's still our son.
Do you find that
comforting right now?
Huh?
What are you saying?
You wish we'd
never done this?
(whispering)
Good night, baby.
Mommy loves you.
You scared me.
It's okay, Mommy.
Shit.
Sorry, there's nothing here.
Are you sure this is
the only Saint Pius?
Well, it's the only one
in this city.
Like I said, they've been
closed for some time now.
What about past student records,
like a search by name?
I'm looking for
a Zachary Clark.
Well, by name could
take a while.
I can wait.
A few weeks?
(glass breaks)
(glass crunching)
(children's voices)
(children screaming)
(children's voices continue)
(doorbell rings)
- Hi.
- Yes?
Sorry to bother you.
My name's Paul Duncan.
I know this sounds crazy,
but I'm here about Zachary Clark.
Does that name mean
anything to you?
- He's a young child, a boy.
- No, I'm sorry.
What about the previous owners?
Did they have any children?
Melinda.
I'm sorry.
No, there were
no previous owners.
My husband and I bought this place
about six years ago
when it was just
a burnt-down shell.
And he's an architect,
so we restored it.
- So, it was just vacant?
- Well, for a few years, yeah.
But I don't know anything
about its previous owners.
- Right.
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, I just...
- I'm sorry to bother you.
Sorry, the nanny...
we interviewed quite a few
nannies, mostly by phone,
but I remember speaking to one who
I could have sworn said she used
to work for the family
who used to live at this address.
I think that I saved
her contact information, if...
Great, thank you.
Cora Williams?
You don't know me,
but I need to talk to you.
It's about Zachary Clark.
Come in.
(answering machine beeps)
Machine voice:
You have no messages.
Damn it!
Cora:
I had hoped I'd never
hear that name again.
What did he do?
There had been
incidents at school.
He never had any friends, used
to come home with all sorts of scrapes.
Once they locked him
in an empty classroom.
A teacher finally found him,
terrified and shaken.
But that was before
he started acting up.
Pretty soon,
those kids got wise
and just left him alone.
Then there was the fire.
The fire at Saint Pius?
Cora:
They never found out how
the fire got started, but I knew.
And when Zachary came home,
I asked him about it.
He just gave me this smile.
Adam?
I swear, when I looked
into those eyes of his,
I didn't see anything
but evil behind them.
Cora:
I kept my distance.
I was scared of what else
he might be capable of...
all these terrible thoughts
running through my mind.
(gasps)
It was just the two of us
at home that day.
He was taking his bath
when it suddenly became
clear to me what I had to do.
He never even
heard me come in.
(Zachary screams)
I tried
to go through with it.
I swear I tried, but...
I just... I couldn't.
I just couldn't.
When his mother came home,
Zachary didn't say
a word about what I'd done.
(floor creaks)
Are you here?
I was at home the next day,
when I was struck
by the most awful premonition.
I hurried right over.
Two blocks away, I could
already hear the sirens.
Then I saw all that smoke.
I rushed into the house,
blinded by all those flames,
praying I wasn't too late.
But you were.
It turned out his mother
was already dead by then.
Cora:
I remember it was
freezing cold that day.
It was always cold
in that big house.
Adam?
Cora:
So she went down
the stairs to the basement,
to check on
the water heater.
Are you down there?
Cora:
And that's where he was...
just waiting for her.
So you're saying
Zachary killed his mother.
He used a hammer
he took down from the wall.
(screams)
And when he was done,
he set a fire.
Then he went upstairs
and finished playing.
That's where they
found his body.
Where was his father?
Oh, he was at the hospital
like always.
The hospital,
he was a doctor?
A baby doctor, yeah.
Only, he seemed
more like a scientist to me.
(telephone ringing)
- Paul: Come on, come on.
- (ringing continues)
Come on.
- (telephone rings)
- (machine beeps)
Goddamn it!
Paul:
Are you home? Jessie?
Pick it up
if you're there, please.
Listen, I gotta talk to you
right away, it's important.
Call me as soon
as you get this.
- I love you.
- (machine beeps)
Adam?
Honey, you shouldn't
have opened that.
You shouldn't have
touched that box.
Adam?
Is this me?
Honey, let me explain.
Adam.
Zachary.
- What?!
- (screams)
I need to speak
with Richard Wells.
Woman:
I'm sorry, but Dr. Wells
is at the Hazen funeral today.
A funeral where?
Jessie:
Honey, don't be scared. It's okay.
I'm right here.
Just be careful, okay?
- (metal object clangs)
- (Jessie gasps)
Jessie:
What was that?
- (Jessie gasps)
- (quickly moving footsteps)
Honey...
Mommy?
Adam, where are you?
- (metallic crash)
- (Jessie screams)
Adam?
Adam can't come out
to play right now, Mrs. Duncan.
Wait.
Wait!
Let me explain.
Adam.
You couldn't use him,
could you?
Zachary.
You couldn't use him.
Maybe it never even
occurred to you to try.
No, it occurred to me.
But the fire
destroyed him, right?
You didn't even have
a viable cell.
His genetics I could salvage,
but it was no more than pieces of a map.
I saved what I could,
but after that...
I was this close
to perfecting the procedure,
you can't possibly fathom
that kind of torture.
To have this knowledge,
this power,
and know there's nothing more
you can do about it.
But you did do things
about it, Richard.
Once you had Adam's cell,
you could preserve
his physical characteristics
and manipulate certain genes...
intangibles, like cognition,
personality, his memory.
- I'm right, aren't I?
- Except for one thing.
There was no way
to predict the results.
I could only wait and hope
for a glimpse of him,
the mere indication that
something had lived on.
Lived on?
Do you have any idea what you've done
to my son?! To my family?
I'd think you of all people
would understand,
seeing as we were both after
the same thing. I just wanted him back.
You experimented
with a human life!
So did you.
So did your wife.
No, I would say
there's a huge difference...
Is there, Paul? Do you think
you can just open Pandora's Box
and then just close it again?
We trusted you, goddamn it!
We had no way of knowing.
What you did goes way beyond...
Beyond what?
Societal standards?
You name me a single
medical advancement that didn't.
Tell me something.
If I'm not supposed to do this, Paul,
then how is it that I can?
Because you're a scientist.
Only this isn't about science
or evolution...
it's about moral trespass,
about your ignoring
what's right and wrong.
And what about you, Paul?
Have you trespassed?
I don't know.
Yeah, maybe this is
my punishment for wanting
something that I never
should have had.
And if that's the case,
then so be it.
But believe me when I tell you,
I'm gonna do everything
in my power
to save my child
and see that you pay
for what you've done.
- Paul...
- No, this is over, you understand?
We're gonna go to the police,
and then we're gonna find someplace,
anyplace that can help him.
- You're not going anywhere...
- Like hell I'm not!
Richard:
That was an experiment.
That experiment failed.
We can always terminate
and try again.
Terminate?
That's my son
you're talking about.
Our son! He's yours
because I gave him to you.
You stay away from him!
You hear me?
You stay away!
You were lucky to have him
as long as you did.
You had nothing
when I found you.
I gave you a child,
a house, a job.
Anything in your life
that you value, I provided.
You remember that,
you...
you ungrateful
piece of shit!
(owl hooting)
Why, why, why
didn't he listen?
Adam!
(sobbing)
Adam?
Are you in here?
Adam, where are you?
- (metal rattles)
- (gasps)
(chains clink)
(Jessie screams)
Let go.
Let go of the axe.
Adam.
Adam.
Yes, Daddy?
Who are you?
Who are you right now?
I'm your son.
(steel balls clinking)
Boy:
Come on, Max, throw it.
Throw it, come on.
Man:
Goes upstairs.
Paul:
All right, if you guys
can paint that out
by Thursday, that'd be great.
- Mr. Duncan, that's gonna look great.
- Great.
- Paul: How are you doing?
- All right.
These are going downstairs.
Boy:
Go, go, go!
(children laughing)
Jessie:
Hey, how do you like
your new room?
It's not finished yet.
Hey, kiddo, look...
It's a big change, we know.
But those doctors
you've been working with,
they all say this change
could be really good for you, right?
Sweetie, you've
been doing so great.
And I bet...
in a new town, with new friends,
you're gonna do even better.
I know.
Man:
Mrs. Duncan?
Coming.
Hey...
I got three boxes downstairs
And they're all labeled...
"Toys."
How about you give me
a hand unpacking 'em?
Yeah?
Man:
Where would you like these?
Oh, careful with that,
it's going downstairs.
(floor creaking)
(knocking)
Hey, kiddo,
I thought you were...
Adam?
Ahh! God!
I thought you were
coming down.
Are you all right?
You'd tell me
if there was anything...
Nothing's wrong, Daddy.
I'm fine.
All right.
Trust me.
This is gonna be great for us.
Hey.
It's a place
we can start all over.
