1, 2, 1, 2, 3.
Go!Go!Go!
Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go!
Aah!
Watch out, watch out,
it's hot, it's hot.
Thank you,
honey.
All right.
Ok.
No, no, no, no.
Come on.
We have to wait for Leo.
Get out of here,
Bernard.
We're waiting
for your cousin.
I'm hungry.
I'll tell ya,
yeah, he's good-lookin'.
He's real good-lookin'.
You're gonna like him.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
You think so?
I know so.
I know these kind of things.
Trust me.
I'm blessed with a gift.
Careful.
It's real hot.
I got it, I got it.
Val, this all
looks wonderful.
Yeah.
Let's try  and make
a little room here.
What about your husband,
is he coming?
Oh, no.
Frank can't come, honey.
I meant to tell you.
He has to work,
but he's gonna meet Leo
tomorrow at the interview.
Ok. Well...
At least
Bernard's eating.
Hey, sweetie.
- How you doin'?
- Good.
- Hmm?
- Yeah.
Erica, you know Belvee?
Belva.
Belva.. Belva.
Belva. Nice.
Hey.
Hey.
I was telling her about
your cousin, about Leo.
I want her to meet him.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
Hey. Hey, every body.
He's here.
Yay!
Hey!
Hey, allright!
Hey, Ma.
How you doin'? Good?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.
You look terrific.
Oh, thanks. You, too.
I'm so glad you're home.
Me, too.
Hey!
Hey, Leo!
Leo the lion!
We all came to see you,
buddy. How you doin'?
I'm all right.
I love ya, man.
Welcome home.
Thanks.
It's good to see you.
You, too.
- How you doin'?
- Real good.
Leo, welcome home.
Hey,
what's up, Dante?
Good to see you.
What's up, Todd?
- What's up, Leo?
- Neil.
You guys all look like
you're doin' really good.
Don't worry  about it.
It's gonna be comin'
your way soon enough.
Hey, um,
I want you to meet Belva.
Belva, this is Leo.
This is Leo.
Hi.
Belva's a dancer.
Hi.
Come on. We've
got so much food.
Everybody,
let's eat.
Just dig in.
Just help yourselves.
Mr. Handler.
We need to go over
a few things.
Where can we talk?
I guess
in the bedroom.
Come on.
My records show
that you were released
at, uh...
4:00 this afternoon.
That's right.
You're supposed to make
an arrival report.
Well,
nobody told me that.
I thought
I had 24 hours.
OK, well, in the future,
you should know that
you're required to report
with due diligence.
Now, your profile says
you had some problems.
I see here that you served
16 months for auto theft.
So your parole status
has you on
intensive supervision.
I'll have access
to your bank records,
your W-2s, your pay stubs.
That's to keep
track of your cash flow.
Now, what about employment?
You know what you're gonna do?
Yeah, I think
I got something.
What's that?
Well, my aunt's new husband
has his own business.
You know, he's very,
very important.
I'm supposed to go and
interview with him tomorrow.
A couple of
my friends out there,
they've been
workin' for him, too.
Mm-hmm.
What about
your counseling?
You know, I just--I don't
wanna cause no problems.
I just wanna become
a productive person again,
you know, in society.
So, what'd you think?
He looks good, right?
He looks good.
Yeah. I never knew
him from before.
Yeah, that's--
I mean, that's the point.
I don't--
I have nothin' to go by.
Hey.
Every thing OK?
Leo.. Yeah.
How you doin'? How come
you're not out there?
'Cause Willie's talkin'
with every body,
and I just... just wanted
to get away for a second.
You and him
still OK together?
Yeah.
We're thinking about
maybe settling down...
but he's so busy
with work right now, you know.
You know, I was really sorry
to hear about your father.
He was a good man.
Maybe we should
go back out there.
Erica.
What about your new
father, you like him?
He's all right.
Did you get my letters?
Whoa!
They must've forgot
to switch the fuse box.
OK, let's check out
the radio...
There you are.
Hi, Ma.
Looks like
there's a blackout, huh?
Yeah.
Erica, why don't you
let your cousin be?
See if they need
anything out there.
Excuse me, Aunt Kitty?
Yeah.
I just wanted
to thank you
and your husband for
the meeting tomorrow.
I really
appreciate that.
Well, you know I'd do
anything for your mother.
She's not
doing too well.
You should know that.
Her heart
is getting weaker.
Here he is.
Leo!
Hey, Leo!
What's up?
What's up?
What's up, buddy? Aah!
- How you doin', all right?
- Yeah, good.
Did you get a beer
or something?
No. I'm all right.
All right.
Hey, I just wanted
to tell you...
me and the guys really
appreciate what you did.
Didn't say nothing
to the cops about us.
I would never fold
on you. You know that.
Look, I want you
to come work with us.
So tomorrow
when you see Frank,
you tell him that,
all right?
- All right.
- OK, good.
Come have a beer with us,
OK, Leo?
Hey, you've had enough
for every body.
No.
Leo.
We're all gonna go
to the club this weekend.
You know, like we used to.
All right?
Oh,
that sounds excellent.
Be good.
Hey.
Hey, Leo,
what's going on?
What's up, buddy?
You don't say hi?
You look good.
Excuse me, everyone.
Every one!
Um, I just want to say
that I am very happy
to have you all here.
And...
the last few years
have been...
Well,
sometimes not so easy,
but that's all over now.
And so from now on,
we're gonna have nothing
but good times.
That's all I wanted to say.
Hear, hear.
Absolutely.
All right.
Let's have some coffee,
if I can find the pot.
Yeah!
Ma...
I just--I just
wanted to tell you
that I'm sorry ...
for every thing.
Don't worry about it.
Go on, be with your friends.
Have a good time.
What's up, Todd?
Leo, sit down.
Talk to us.
How you doin'?
Bye, Denise.
My best to your mother.
Send him in, Denise.
Leo.
Nice
to finally meet you.
It's nice
to meet you, too.
Sorry
you had to wait.
Sit down.
All right. Thanks.
So, uh...
how's your mother?
She's OK. She's try in',
you know, she's battlin'.
We had a lot of nice
conversations about you.
She's a wonderful woman.
I mean, supporting you
by herself
for all those years
took a lot of guts.
I know.
And I'm gonna do every thing
I can to make it up to her.
My wife and I, we, uh,
tried to help her out,
but, uh...
she wouldn't take it.
I--I admire that.
I know
the last couple of years
have been pretty
hard on her.
You got yourself
in some trouble,
uh, you stole
a couple of cars
or something.
Yeah.
You did
a little time, huh?
I know it's pretty
tough in there, uh...
but the business world
ain't that much different.
I mean, sometimes
you gotta have eyes
in the back of
your fucking head.
So, uh, you know
what we do here?
If it's on a train, if it's
on a New York subway,
we make it or we fix it.
Uh... couplers, brakes,
transformers, every thing.
You got any experience
with stuff like that?
I could learn.
Learn... good.
There's some, uh,
very good training programs
out there for machinists,
and I could make a call.
Well, I really need to support
me and my mother right now.
How long would
a program like that take?
Good machinist?
Uh... couple years.
But, uh, you'd
have a good union job
waitin' for you here
when you were through.
400, 500 a week, uh...
and, uh...
I could help you along
a little till you graduate.
What about Willie? I mean,
I know he didn't go to school,
And he thought that maybe
I could work with him.
I don't think that's
such a good idea for you.
Well, what does he do?
He-- He deals with
suppliers mostly. Uh...
ah, I don't know.
I really think that you
should look into a program.
I'd-- I'd have
to think about that.
All right.
Uh, look,
why don't, uh...
why don't you and
your mother come over
To the house
Saturday night
for a little dinner?
The whole family
will be there.
It'll be very  nice.
OK.
Leo.
Thanks for comin'
and, look, uh...
you're a nephew now,
and I'd really like
to help you.

Hey, Willie,
what's up, man?
Como esta, bien?
Hey, this is my friend Leo.
Leo, this is Ricky.
We went to Francis Lewis
together.
Cool.
Yo, thanks for hooking me up
with Russell, man.
He put in my whole system
for me.
I like the way
it sounds, man.
I mean,
I like what he did.
I told you.
He's the best.
You did.
He's a good worker.
So what's up?
What do you want?
Uh,
give me 2 Millers,
uh, Jim Beam, and, uh,
some rum and Coke
for them out there.
Put it on my tab.
Yeah.
&Sempre assim&
Willie, I don't know
what the fuck I'm gonna do.
About what? Frank?
Yeah.
You don't gotta
go back to school.
Look, he tried that same shit
with me when I started.
I-- I convinced him,
let me work with the suits.
Well,
how did you do that?
He let me hang out with them,
and I earned their respect.
You're throwin' a lot
of fuckin' money around.
What is it you do
for this guy?
Look, why don't you
come down with me tomorrow
and see for yourself?
All right? If you like it,
we'll talk to Frank about it.
All right,
I'm just asking,
'cause you know I can't
get into no trouble.
You know that.
Nah,
you won't get into trouble.
I won't let you
get into trouble.
Look, Frank's a great man.
We got a real chance
with him.
You know my mother spent
her whole fuckin' life
on handouts and shit.
Now I got fuckin' money
in my pocket.
The sky's the limit.
Yeah, but you was always
good with people, you know.
I'm not too good
with words.
Hey, you're
my best friend.
I'm gonna look out for you.
I'll get you in.
Yeah, I know, I just
hope it works out,
'cause I would like that
a lot, you know?
I want to work with you.
Great, next week.
So, what'd you think
about Belva?
Aw, she's good from far
but far from good, you know?

Raise your hands.

OK,
you're all right. Go ahead.
Thanks, Glenn.
All right, Willie.
Come on.
You got a lot of fuckin'
security here, will.
Is it all right that I'm
coming down here with you?
Yeah, yeah, you're fine.
They all know me here.
So, what is this place?
This is Borough Hall.
The train businesses
live and die here.
Today we're
going after contracts
worth $14 million.
Now, it's gonna be
a fuckin' fight,
'cause all our rivals
are gonna be here.
Right now,
our main competition
is with
the Weltech Corporation.
It's run by Manny Sequiera
and Hector Gallardo.
They're a minority company,
so they're guaranteed
to get 10% of the business.
Frank says Sequiera
paid off 2 councilmen
to get that deal.
Paul Lazzarides
works right under Frank.
He makes our presentations
to the transit authority.
At the head of the authority
is Al Granada.
And my job is to do whatever
I can to keep him happy
so that he'll keep
sendin' the work our way.
Do I look OK?
I mean,
I don't wanna call
no attention to myself.
You look great.
Come on, let's go in.
We now come up
on order 4-2-3-9-9,
regarding the replacement
of the train rectifiers
on the Queens
and Bronx lines.
After careful review,
weighing both price
and performance ratings,
the committee has decided
to award this contract
to the Electric Rail
Corporation of Maspeth.
Make a note of that.
Next, order 4-6-9-6-4.
It's for 230 couplers,
all for the subway--
Mr. Supervisor,
please.
Hector, let me finish
reading the decisions.
Look, that contract
is part of our guarantee.
I'm sorry ,
you're wrong.
But we been
getting the rectifiers,
and that's the deal.
Hector,
let me finish, please.
They know it.
The deal
for minority quotas
is 10% of the business.
Now, which 10%
is up to us.
But I'll tell you
one thing:
if it was up to me,
Weltech wouldn't be
gettin' anything,
because
your failure rates
have been going
through the roof.
That's 'cause of them.
Hector,
please, let me finish.
But they're trying
to put us out of business,
and you're a part of it.
We wanna make a protest
with the inspector general.
Look, there have been
several investigations
into the allegations made
by the people at Weltech.
And we have been
repeatedly cleared
of any wrongdoing.
They know this,
but they continue
to persist
with these outrageous
accusations.
And I think they
owe us an apology.
I owe you an apology?
Yes.
Let's get on
with the meeting.
Both of you.
We got business
to transact.
I'm gonna knock you right
into the middle of next week.
Let's go, oldman!
Hey, what do you
think I'm doing?
Running some kind of
3-ring circus over here?
Come on.
Hey, Gutierrez.
I want to talk to you.
I've got nothing to say, Hector.
Hey, I'm your friend, man.
I know what you're doing.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Why don't you
come work for us
instead of
those cabrones?
Don't waste my time.
Hey.
You're never gonna be
as white as those guys.
Let's go.
Who's this?
That's Leo.
You'll get to know him.
I'm not in the mood
to make any
new friends today.
It'll be all right.
Who's that?
That's Frank's nephew.
Did he do time?
Yeah, just for a little bit,
you know?
Yeah.
Don't worry.
He's a good kid.
Got the money?
Say hello
to your uncle for me.
See you around, Willie.
All right,
take it easy.
What the fuck
was that, Will?
Nothin'.
He's just, uh...
he's very
worried about wires.
Either that,
or he's got a thing for me.
It seems pretty
fuckin' weird to me.
Does he get a cut
of every thing?
Listen to you.
Don't worry  about it.
He's a city official.
It's just the way
the system works.
But here's
the good part.
This is for you.
Pretty good, huh?
A little pocket change.
You must have
saved up a lot.
Nah, I think I spend it
all on your cousin.
All right, well,
we got a few more things
we got to do this week.
And next week, I'll take you
down to the yards
into the tunnels.
That sounds good.
All right.
Let's go do it.
In the business,
favors are more important
than threats.
It's about making people
feel wanted and liked,
making them feel
appreciated.
You find out
what they like,
and you makeit
happen for them.
They want to go
to a ball game or a show,
get them the tickets.
They want something for
their wife or their girlfriend,
get them a nice fur.
Sometimes all they want
is an expensive bottle of wine.
If all they want
is cash,
there's always
plenty of that.
If you take care
of them,
this business
can take care of you.
Just don't spend it all
in one place.
Leo, come on, are you ready?
We got to go soon.
Ma...
I got you something.
What are you doing?
You don't have
to get me anything.
Oh, I wanted to.
I just thought
you needed it.
Oh, Leo, you can't.
Every  dollar is saved.
You know that.
It's beautiful.
Thank you.
Now, come on.
Frank is sending
a car for us.
All right.
I'm just going
to change real quick.
That's it
right there.
That's their house.
Bernard,
get the door.
Mom, I'm
already sitting down.
Sorry we're late.
Here they are.
Oh, good. Good. Hey.
Come on in.
Sit down, sit down.
Do me a favor, Will.
Will you sit over there?
Sit over here, Leo.
Good.
Well,
hi, Bernard.
This is
a really nice house.
Oh, thanks.
I'm glad you like it.
You know, we're doing
a little work on it.
I'm building a little
family room in the back.
Yeah, and those assholes
come wake us up every  morning.
Erica, is that
absolutely necessary?
Now, please,
don't start.
Ma, could I have
some of that lomein?
Frank, this all
looks delicious.
Ah, it's a wonderful place.
They got great food.
It's a little
rich sometimes.
Willie,
this is Bernie's dish.
Give it to him.
Will you
pass the rice back
when you're
finished with it?
Thanks, Mom.
So, Leo,
did you tell your mother
what we talked about?
What was that?
I told him that
I thought maybe he should
look into some training
program as a machinist.
Yeah.
That sounds terrific.
Well, actually,
I went out with Willie,
and I'm thinking
of working with him.
Yeah, Iknow.
I want to talk to you
about that.
Oh,
that sounds good.
The two of them
work together.
That sounds good,
huh?
Uh, I don't understand.
I mean, I thought we had
this whole conversation.
I don't feel comfortable
taking your money.
Money?
Oh, no. We've been
through all this.
Nobody's giving us
any money.
Why can't they
work together?
Erica.
It's all right.
Leo, I hope every thing
works out for you,
and you'll be around
the business.
Maybe you'll learn
something.
I really hope so.
Good.
Good. All right.
Pass me that.
OK, good.
Clean plate club, OK?
You got
the hot mustard there?
Got to have
the hot mustard.
Ducksauce.
Erica.
Hey.
What?
I want to show you
something.
What?
What is it?
Open it up.
Oh, Willie.
We'll tell every one
this weekend.
I want to make this
right.
I love you.
So where we going?
We're going
to the sunny sideyards.
The guys'll be there.
They're waiting for us,
and there's someone new
I want you to meet
that's working
with me now.
What are we going
to do down there?
We take out our
competitors' trains--
short their stuff out,
make sure
it don't work right.
And they get hit
as unreliable,
and we get the jobs.
Tonight,
it's Weltech's trains.
They're
those fucking guys
we had the run-in with
at Borough Hall,
remember?
I just want you to stand
back and watch tonight.
Everything's going
to be all right.
Boys, what's going on?
How you doing?
What's up, Dante?
How you doing, Todd?
Hey, Leo.
How you doing, man?
What's going on?
How you doing?
Good.
He's coming down with me
to make a drop.
You ever in Local One
or Local Three?
No.
Because we don't deal
with construction.
I don't know nothing
about that.
All right,
well, you're here
'cause your friends
clear you.
All right,
we're going down.
Leo...
stay here.
Make sure nobody
comes down, all right?
All right. I'll hang
right here for you.
Got you
those Knicks tickets.
This is for you.
I don't want it, Willie.
You got to get your guys
off the tracks.
What are you
talking about?
You've been moved out.
What?
Weltech
come in here last week,
and they put 2K
right there.
And they got the muscle
to back it up.
Come on.
You know how this works.
Somebody comes to you
with a better offer,
you come back at us.
No, not any more.
Wordis Electric Rail's
going under,
and Weltech
guaranteed me
they'd match any offer.
Now, Willie,
get them off the tracks,
'cause I got the cops
coming down here.
Keep going.
Come on, Elliot.
You wouldn't
do that to us.
What the fuck
are you doing?
Jump!
Willie!
Will!
Hey, what are you doing?
Nothing.
Nothing? What do you
mean, nothing?
I ought to crack
your fucking head open,
you know that?
Turn that thing off.
What the fuck you going
to do with that?
Turn that
fucking thing off.
Hey, I'm talking to you.
You got some I.D.?
Don't fucking
do it, man.
Uhh!
Uhh...
All right, put your hands up.
Turn around.
You motherfucker!
Listen, I didn't
do nothing!
You want to run?
I ought to break you
down, motherfucker!
Ohh!
Huhh!
Hello?
Mrs. Handler.
Hey, is Leo there?
I'm here, Ma.
You can hang up.
Leo...
you got to know I didn't mean
to do it. You know that.
Willie,
what the fuck happened?
You said every thing was
going to be all right.
I know, I know.
Everything
got fucked up.
Did anyone see you?
What'd you do?
What do you mean,
what did I do?
A fucking cop
came down there
and beat me
on my fucking head.
You OK?
Yeah, I'm all right, but
I don't know about the cop.
All right.
We can't panic.
I'll talk to Frank,
and he'll know what to do.
Don't worry, Leo.
The borough can't afford
arrests
and investigations.
The fucking politicians
are in on it.
You understand?
I understand.
Willie?
Hey...
I didn't know you were
staying here tonight.
I had to get out
of that fucking house.
Who's that?
Who is it?
It's Raymond.
What the fuck
happened?
I can't talk right now.
Get the guys, and we'll meet
back at the office tonight.
All right?
Is that blood
on your hand?
It's nothing.
I cut myself.
Go on.
Who was that?
It was just
someone from work.
Now?
Don't worry about it.
Just go back
to sleep.
Hello.
Hold on.
Who is it?
I don't know.
Yeah?
You had some
trouble this morning?
Who is this?
You know,
the yard master is dead,
and that cop may not
make it, either.
Hector, is that you?
If you come forward,
Weltech has some
very good lawyers.
Don't call here again.
What does
every body want?
I'm sorry
it's so crazy here.
I didn't know you were
gonna be here this morning.
I can't wait
till we get married.
Hey.
I'll tell my mother,
and we'll
get married.
We're gonna
have a whole family.
What's the matter?
Nothin'. I'm tired.
Si.
El esta en un meeting.
Korman.. I mean, we already
got enough problems
with them in or it is
as it is.
Goddamn conglomerates
lose their
defense contracts
out on the island,
then suddenly they're back
in the goddamn train
business.
We understand
your problem,
but there's nothin'
we can do about it right now.
Look, I'm gettin'
squeezed from all sides.
You got the fuckin'
conglomerates
comin' in here takin' away
the work at the top.
The minorities are
guaranteed the work
at the bottom, and me,
I'm squeezed
in the goddamn middle.
Frank,
take it easy, will you?
You got to wait
till after the election.
Oh,
after the election?
After this election,
the next election?
There's always
an election.
You have to
be patient, Frank.
Well, you listen to me.
You gotta kill
these minority quotas,
or I'm out of business.
It's as simple as that.
It's too hot
for us right now.
We got this killing
in the yards.
I mean, who knows
where that's gonna go?
You know anything
about that, Frank?
No. I do know if
it were any of my guys,
I'd fuckin' kill 'em.
All right?
Well, we hear
that cop's still alive, Frank.
He's in a coma.
If he pulls through and it
turns out to be the business,
all holy hell's
gonna break loose.
Yeah, the cops'll
be all over us.
There's no way
we could control it.
Si, si.
Times are changin'.
What? What is it?
It's me.
Hey, Willie.
What do you need?
I want to talk to you
about something.
Well, I'm very
busy right now.
It's no big deal.
I can take care
of it myself.
All right. Good.
Good.
Look,
what I'm tellin' you here
is that my company's
in serious fuckin' trouble.
Do you understand?
A metropolitan
community transit worker
is dead,
and a police officer is in
a coma after a predawn attack
at the Sunnyside
repair yards in Queens.
Police say
Officer Gerald Rifkin
responded to an alarm call
at the repair yards
just after
1:00 this morning.
10 minutes later,
police backup units
discovered Officer Rifkin
face down and unconscious
on the tracks.
The body of yardmaster
Elliot Gorwitz
was also found nearby
in his office.
He had bled to death
from a single stab wound.
Gorwitz had worked
for the MCT for 14 years.
Queensborough President
Arthur Mydanick
said he was shocked
and saddened
when he learned
about the incident.
Of course I was--I was
very  upset to hear about this.
I mean, we're not going to
stand for these kind of attacks.
We're gonna put
finding the assailants
at the top
of our agenda right now.
Officer Rifkin
remains listed
in critical condition,
and tonight, police
are still without a suspect.
Nice.
I need milk.
I'll get it,
Aunt Val.
Oh, thanks, honey.
You still go
to Waldbaum's?
Yeah, sometimes.
Leo, is that
for you?
Yeah.
I got it, Mom.
What's goin' on?
We gotta talk.
The guys are waitin'
for us downstairs.
All right.
Let me get my jacket.
Willie, we're havin'
some cake. Come on in.
Oh, thank you,
Mrs. Handler.
I can't right now.
I gotta go.
But Erica's here.
Don't you want
to come in?Come on.
Yeah, come on in.
Hey, I didn't know
you were here.
Yep.
Hi.
Hi, Mrs. Olchin.
You look very
handsome tonight.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
I gotta run.
- Well--
- no, no, no.
Come here.
Ma...
Willie and me, we talked
about maybe gettin' married.
Well, when did this happen?
We talked
about it last night.
What about school?
I'm still gonna finish.
Well, this is
a very big step.
Don't you think
we should, uh...
discuss it? Hmm?
Hey, Will,
is that them?
Yeah.
No, thanks, huh?
I really gotta go.
I didn't know
we were gonna
get into
all this right now.
I think
we should discuss this.
Hey, Will,
they're waitin'.
Sorry.
Let's go.
Leo.
I got a call from Weltech...
that guy Hector.
They heard about
what happened.
They want to
offer me protection
if I come forward
and talk to their lawyers.
They'd do anything
to get somethin' on Frank.
Don't you fuckin'
turn on me, Willie.
Of course not.
I hung up
on the fuckin' guy.
I'm just sayin'
we gotta stay tight here.
Hey, you gotta listen to
what the guys have to say.
Just-- just listen
to what they have to say.
Because we're in
a very tough situation.
What's up, Todd?
What's goin' on?
Just get in the back.
That cop you hit?
He's a big
fuckin' problem for us.
If he wakes up,
we're all in trouble.
We don't know what you might
do to stay out of jail.
I wouldn't fuck you.
Yeah, but you get caught now,
and it's life for you.
Will, you know
I wouldn't do that.
What happened?
I thought you were
gonna talk to Frank.
Frank's got no pull
with the police.
He's on the fourth
floor at booth memorial.
4 beds to a room.
Todd's friend's
an orderly.
He works the night shift.
He'll get you in.
They got one officer
in front of the ward.
That's it.
He's on an 8-hour shift.
Wait till
he takes a leak,
and then you go inside.
That guy's
a fuckin' cop.
Nobody wants this, Leo.
It's the only thing
we can do.
I don't know
if I could do this.
Well,
you think about it,
'cause the only thing
that cop saw was you.
If you can't take care
of this for us,
we gotta take care
of it ourselves.
We are not goin'
after that fuckin' cop.
Do you understand?
All right.
You guys wait here.
Todd's gonna
talk to his guy.
Come on.
Leo...
if anything happens,
if anything goes wrong,
then you run,
and you get
the fuck out of the city.
I'll look in on your mother.
I feel like I'm
gonna fuckin' die.
Come on, man.
My break's almost over.
Don't you fuckin' back out.
Well, now.
How are we feeling?
I called
your family, Jerry.
They're on their way down,
allright?
You were out
cold there for a while.
Just rest.
You just need some rest.
Charlie. Charlie, 10-4.
Fuck. Fuck.
What happened?
Goddamn motherfucker
ran away!
Your friend
is fuckin' dead, Willie.
You hear me?
He's fuckin' dead!
What's wrong?
He didn't come home
last night... from work.
What happened?
I don't know.
He missed his parole
meeting this morning.
They called here.
They're lookin' for him.
They said
he's in violation.
He's in violation.
All right. Sit down.
Calm down, huh?
Let's just sit down.
Yeah, but what if...
what if
something happened?
Val, listen to me.
You're my sister,
I love you,
and you can't let this
keep killing you.
You hear me?
Hmm?
OK, gentlemen.
Right in here.
All the way down the tracks.
Take your pictures
of our circuit layouts
in the train signal boxes.
Build them to the specs.
Preference will be given
to minority companies
for a portion
of these contracts.
You think about
what I said?
Get off.
Pendejo.
Hey, Terr. You gonna
help us out a little here?
I wouldn't even bother
with a bid on this one
if I were you.
What? What are you
talking about?
Word come from
the inspector general.
The cop that was hit
went through the books
and come up with a suspect.
It's your nephew.
Sorry to have to be
the one to tell you.
You're gonna get caught.
Shut the fuck up.
You'll be
the first one to go.
Contractor..Hey, hey, hey!
Come on! Watchit!
Knock it off. Settle down.
What's
the matter with you, huh?
Why didn't you
fuckin' tell me?
We were gonna try
and handle it on our own.
On your own?
You fucking idiot.
On your own?
Willie, this could
be devastating for us.
If the borough connects us
to what happened,
we're out of business.
I mean, we could
all go to jail.
I should've
never let him
go down there with you.
Goddamn accident
waiting to happen.
Frank,
it's gonna be all right.
Leo's gone.
Nobody knows
he was workin' for us.
But they're not
gonna stop investigating.
What do you think, there's
a statute of limitations
for a murder case?
Who killed
the yardmaster?
Was it Leo?
I understand.
Tryin' to protect
your friend.
Frank, we're gonna
have to distance ourselves
from your nephew.
Issue a denial, say
that he never worked here.
I'll talk
to the accountants,
make sure they
didn't file any W-2s.
I'll also
put out a statement--
We're all very saddened
by the turn of events,
et cetera and so forth.
Please.
None of that's gonna hold.
At some point it's
gonna lead back to us.
What we gotta do
is talk to this cop...
see what it'll take
to make him remember
things differently.
Tonight's the
borough president's party.
I'll talk to Seymour...
see if it's something
we can pursue.
I thought
I could help him.
I thought I was
gonna help him.
I'm sorry.
What, are we
waitin' for them?
We're always
waiting for them.
Hello?
Hey, Bernie.
Hey.
How ya doin'?
Come on,
we ready?
we'll be
right down.
Right down?
What's the problem?
Is Willie
downstairs?
Yeah.
Well?
They're thinking
about getting married.
I'm not gonna talk
about it with him here.
He's not my father.
Your mother
looks very upset.
Don't you
think you should at least
discuss it with her?
Hmm?
Could you get the fuck
out of my room?
- Hey.
- Frank..it's all right.
Listen, you do
what you want to do.
You want to upset
your mother, go ahead.
You want to run
into this thing
without thinkin'
about it,
you do that,
but get ready.
Get ready.
Man.. Thank you.
Sweetie...
is he
enjoying it?
Hi, Harriet.
How are you?
Let's go find Arthur and
wish him a happy birthday.
Yes, you
want to come?
Oh, no. I've
said enough.
You've said enough.
There he is.
Hey, Manny.
Hey, Frank.
Good to see you.
- How are you?
- Good.
Arthur.
I don't think he heard you.
Looks like they got some
nice roast beef over there.
Why don't you guys
go sit down?
And I'll join you
in a minute.
All right.
What is this? I try
to go say hello to art,
and he gives me
the cold shoulder.
He can't be seen
with you right now.
You gotta understand that.
He embarrassed me.
I mean, you know
how much money
I give to this
fuckin' guy's campaign?
Just wait till things
calm down a bit, all right?
Look, uh,
w-what do you know
about this here cop?
You know, the one
that's givin' us
all the hassle?
They say he's--
They say he's pretty
sure about a suspect.
Well, how sure?
I don't know.
What are you trying to say?
Well, I thought maybe...
we could create
a little fund for him.
You know, he was hit
in the head,
and maybe he don't
remember so good.
I could do
a little diggin'.
Oh, good.
You do that.
'Cause we want
to help him out.
And before
this investigation
gets completely
out of hand.
Come on!
Don't move!
Warrant service, ma'am.
We're looking for your son.
Is he here?
No.
What are you doing?
We got
a warrant for his arrest.
Ma'am, what are you doing?
You all right?
He's not here.
Please.
Over here,Joe!
Ma'am.
Looks like she'shaving
chest pains, Kevin.
Toss it all out!
Come on!
Check it for weapons!
She's having problems.
Call paramedics.
Officer Gerald Rifkin
will soon be
on his way home.
Rifkin, who was injured
in an attack early Saturday
at the Sunnyside rail yards
in Queens, has recovered.
And tonight he has given
police their first lead
in their search
for his assailant
and the killer
of an MCT yardmaster.
After reviewing
police mugbooks,
Rifkin positively
identified
24-year-old ex-convict
Leo Handler
as his assailant.
And although police believe
Handler may have
fled the state,
they are asking anyone
with any information
as to his whereabouts
to contact them
immediately.
Coming up... where were you
when the lights went out?
Hello?
It's me, Will.
Leo.
Where are you?
You OK?
They're blaming me
for things I didn'tdo.
They're blaming me
for every thing,
and you know
that ain't right, Will.
I can't go nowhere.
I can't talk to nobody.
I'msorry. I--
There's nothin'
I can do right now.
Well, when can I come back?
Leo...
y-you gotta stay away
for a little longer, OK?
Well, how's my mother?
I wanted to call her,
but they probably
got the phones tapped.
Well,
did you see her?
Willie?
Yeah, I did.
Is she OK?
She's gonna be all right.
What do you mean?
What's wrong?
No, nothing.
The family's with her,
and she's OK.
Hey. I can hear it
in your fuckin' voice.
No, listen. Leo, listen.
Calm down, all right?
Look, I can't
talk right now,
but call me
back in a couple weeks.
And just know
that Frank's
tryin' to work
everything out, OK?
Leo?
You there?
Yeah, all right.
Is your mother up there?
What are you doing here?
Erica..
Want to get caught?
Police were here.
I know. I've been
watching 'em come and go.
I'll go around the back.
Let me in.
Go ahead.
I need to see her.
Ma...
Ma...
you up?
How you feeling?
I just come by to see
how you were doing.
Ma...
I know I'm not
the son you wanted.
And I promised myself
that I would do whatever
I could to fit in.
What happened before,
I know I did wrong.
But I did not do what
they're sayin' that I did.
And I know...
I know that I'll never
be able to redeem myself.
But I just
wanted you to know.
It wasn't me, Mom.
I'm leavin' now.
I just wanted to see
how she was doin'.
Leo?
Was Willie with you?
At the yards?
It wasn't him, was it?
Hey...
you gotta
be strong now.
I know you guys
had plans.
We just gotta try
to find a way
through this.
And we're gonna get
through this, OK?
Come on.
Thanks for
lookin' after her.
Yeah.
I'll come back
tomorrow.
Get the doctor
to come see her, OK?
Mr. Olchin, sorry to
interrupt your meeting.
Detective Tommasino.
How you doin'?
Detective Bulette.
Pleasure. What can
I do for you fellas?
I'd like you
to look at this.
I want to ask you
a few questions.
Oh, him. Yeah.
Do you have
any knowledge
as to his
whereabouts?
I only met him
a couple of times.
Wife says he's
a troubled kid.
He was not
in your employ?
Oh, no.
Bulette.. We spoke
to your secretary,
and she said
he came by to see you.
Yeah, right. Uh,
he was lookin' for ajob,
but, uh, I didn't
have anything for him.
You will
contactus in the event
that you gain any
additional information?
Oh, sure. Absolutely, yes.
Thank you
for your time.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Seymour,
what'd you find out?
There's
gonna be a hearing
about that yardmaster
who got killed.
There's somethin' else,
too, Frank.
I talked to the division
captain last night.
He says there's no way.
The cop is straight.
There's no chance he's gonna
go under the table for us.
Well, Jesus Christ.
Can't, uh, Mydanick
help us out here?
What do you mean,
"help"?
The kid's a murderer.
What'd the cops
say to you?
What-- what do you think?
They're lookin' for him.
Maybe you
should think about
gettin' him
before they do.
What?
Make sure
he don't turn up.
What are we talkin'
about here, Seymour?
I mean, w-what
do you think I am?
I'm just sayin'
this is a real priority
for the borough
president right here.
He doesn't want us
to all end up
like Donnie Manes.
Yeah, well...
you guys are gonna
just have to think
of somethin' else,
'cause...
I could never do
nothin' like that.
Fuckin' kid is, uh,
is in my family.
Make sure
he don't turn up.
Is there anything
more we can be doing, Doctor?
I have heron digoxin,
so we'll have to watch.
Ah, is there a number?
I need to get your number.
Take care.
OK, thanks.
Hi, Mrs. Olchin.
Hey, sweetheart.
Your brother said
you'd be here.
I've been
calling you all day.
Ma.
I'll go inside.
Where you been?
I been here.
I know that.
How come you don't
call me back?
There's just a lot
goin' on right now.
Does your mother
got a problem with me?
I don't know. No.
'Cause I saw the way
she looked at me
when you told her
we were gonna get married.
I think
you should go.
I want to talk to you.
I don't have
anything to say.
Erica.
Is it-- is this 'cause
of what happened with Leo?
'Cause...
I'm goin'
back inside now.
No, Erica, wait.
I want to talk to you.
Erica, listen.
Erica!
Fuck.
I got a hearing
coming up
with the, uh,
with the city.
It'd be nice
if you came with me
for a little
support.
OK.
How's your sister?
What's
the matter, honey?
I saw Leo tonight...
outside the apartment.
You saw Leo tonight?
He's gonna wind up getting
all of us into trouble.
You told me
he wasn't comin' back.
I was just there
tonight.
He was there?
Yeah. He was there.
We gotta deal
with it right now.
Well, what do you
want me to do?
My wife is, uh...
Very  upset.
I mean, Erica's been
spendin' a lot of time
over there with Leo,
and, you know,
she doesn't like 'em
being together, uh,
because of what happened
between the two of 'em.
What do you mean?
You don't know.
She caught 'em together
when they were 15.
I never knew that.
You know, I found some
letters from him to her,
but, uh, I never
thought that...
I don't know.
I wish there was some way
to take care of this.
What are you doing here?
Willie?
I just came by
to see my mother.
To see your mother.
You're not supposed
to be here.
He went
up to the roof
to see if it
was safe to leave.
Shut up.
Why'd you come back?
You fucked
every thing up.
Willie,
just let him get--
What the fuck?!
What the fuck
is wrong with you?
No! Let me go!
Unh!
You--
You fucking--
Come on!
Come on, Will.
Fucker!
- Come on!
- Motherfucker!
Motherfucker!
It's over, Will.
No more.
You fucked me, Will!
You fucked me!
Shh.
Shh.
Frank?
Jesus.
What happened to you?
Did your mother
see you like that?
I know I haven't
always given you
as much respect
as maybe I should've.
And I haven't
given you a chance
to be a father
to me and my brother.
And I'm sorry...
'cause I know how much
that means to you,
how hard you've tried.
But I hope
you can forgive me.
'Cause it's been hard
for me, too.
I loved my father very much.
And we were all
very close as a family.
That's why
I'm asking you now.
Leo needs your help.
He wants to see you.
I told him you would.
Please.
Please.
Where is he?
I could take you.
Go out to the car.
Leo?
Yeah, over here.
You know, you been causing me
a lot of difficulty.
Police been coming
to see me.
I need you to help me.
What is it
you think I could do?
I really don't know.
I thought maybe
you could talk
to some of them
people you know,
'cause I didn't
kill anybody.
Do you have
any idea who did?
I...
I wish I could
help you, Leo.
I-- I really do.
But, uh, I gotta
do what I can
to protect
what I've built.
You know, for my family.
'Cause, uh,
that's all I got left.
Leo.
Leo?
You take care of yourself.
I can't stay, Ma.
Too many people
know I'm here.
They're all
against me now.
I know.
I'm sorry it was always
just the two of us.
Always having to deal
with every thing ourselves.
I never
needed nobody else anyway.
You never had...
someone to look to, though.
I used to look
at those business people
all dressed up,
goin' to the city.
I always hoped
you could be one of them.
You'd look good
in one of those suits.
Yeah, but...
who knows
what they do, huh?
I love you, Ma.
Don't lose faith.
I'll stay a little
longer tonight, OK?
OK.
I'm gonna be good.
I'm gonna go get
the rest of my things.
Ma.
Hmm?
Ma.
Ma, I gotta take you down
to the neighbors' right now.
Aah!
You're gonna tell Willie
I know he sent you.
And you're
gonna tell him
he better start looking
over his fuckin' back.
Hey.
Look at me.
I could get every  one
of you fuckin' guys.
I could, too.
I'm gonna.
Don't.
Don't, please.
Get up!
Get us the fuck
out of here!
Did you do it?
Go!
Hundreds of city residents are expected
to turn out at a public hearing
in Queens tonight
to discuss charges
of corruption and payoffs
in the commuter
rail industry.
Queensborough President
Arthur Mydanick
called the meeting
amid criticism his office
isn't doing enough
to help resolve
this escalating scandal.
It may lead to the indictment
of local politicians
and rail industry
executives.
The controversy
was sparked last month
when MCT yardmaster
Elliot Gorwitz was killed
and police officer
Gerald Rifkin was injured
in an attack at
the Sunnyside yards in Queens.
Since the attack, there have
been several protests,
including last week's
demonstration
in midtown Manhattan
that turned violent.
In all,
29 people were arrested
for assault
and disorderly conduct.
Meantime, police are still
looking for Leo Handler,
the only suspect
in the Gorwitz murder.
Frank is very  concerned,
Willie.
I just talked to him.
He asked me
to handle this with you,
find out how it went.
We had a little,
um, a little problem.
But we're gonna
go back again.
You got this
under control?
What, um, what time's
the hearing?
I don't know if you're gonna
be coming to the hearing.
Why not?
Frank and I
discussed it.
Uh, we don't think
it's such a good idea
for you to come,
you know,
because of
the investigation.
Frank doesn't think
I should come?
You know how it is.
Yeah.
Frank also
wanted me to tell you
that, uh,
he doesn't want you
calling the house
anymore.
And, uh, you got
the housekeys, right?
Yeah.
He wants 'em back.
OK?
Well, uh, I don't have them
on me now, right now.
That's all right.
Drop 'em off
as soon as you can.
He's a little worried
about security,
that's all.
See you later, Willie.
Hello, Weltech.
Hector Gallardo, please.
Yes,
just a minute, please.
Hello?
Hector, it's
Willie Gutierrez.
You're too late.
Well,
the purpose of the, uh,
the purpose of this meeting
is to let things air,
give people a voice,
and to announce
our investigation.
And, uh, any more quotes
you'll get later, OK?
Hold-- Hold that for me.
Seymour?
Hiya, Frank.
How you been?
All right?
- Fine.
- Good.
Move one over, sweetie.
You speak to Willie?
Yeah.
He's still, uh,
taking care of the problem.
But you won't have
to worry  about him anymore.
I told him
to keep his distance.
Good. Where's Sequiera?
I haven't seen him.
But I'm sure he
and the Weltech people,
they probably want to make
some kind of big entrance.
Yeah.
That's-- that's enough.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Frank, turn around.
My God,
what is he doing here?
Mr. Handler is willing
to turn himself in
after these proceedings.
You have my assurances.
Tell the borough
we need to talk now.
And I want Mydanick.
Make sure he understands
I want him.
All right,
let's make this quick.
We, uh, we got
a new problem out there.
"We"? What do
you mean, "we"?
He's your nephew.
You're on your own
here, Frank.
You throwing me
to the wolves, jerk-off?
I got records.
I got copies
of every  check that
went from me to you,
that bought your fuckin'
house in sands point.
So, let's not
play games, OK?
What are we
talking about here?
I mean,
there was a murder.
A man lost his life.
You can't bargain
with a man's life.
And this man over here--
this man has been
wrongly accused
of the crime.
OK, all right, look.
Why are you
tellin' me this?
Y- you're talkin'
about my nephew here.
And I'm gonna do
everything I can to help him.
So, now, uh...
you think we can
all agree on something
that would make
every body happy?
I don't know, Frank.
Your nephew here has
a lot of things to say
about
the way your company
conducts its business.
I think
everybody out there
has a right to hear it.
Manny, come on.
What good is that
gonna do anybody, huh?
Can't we, uh, can't
we resolve this nice?
I don't think
you understand.
For a long time
we have been kept down
by this man
and these people.
And I think
it is about time
for a little
retribution.
Don't you think so?
Hello?
What are you doing here?
I came to drop off
the keys.
I thought you'd be
at the hearing.
I was at school.
If you're looking for Leo,
I don't know where he is.
I'm not looking
for Leo.
I know where he is.
Artie. Seymour said
you wanted to see me.
Yeah, come on in, Sal.
This is Deputy Chief Disipio
from police plaza.
How do you do?
Sal, we got a little bit
of a problem here.
Maybe you could
help us out, huh?
Of course.
Anything for you, Artie.
We all think that your
Officer Rifkin out there
is a little confused.
Oh, is that right?
Yeah, that's right.
This young man here,
this is not your guy.
Look, Sal,
we understand the suffering
that Officer Rifkin
has been through,
and we're willing to
compensate him for it, you know.
Of course, we'd present you
with the remuneration,
and, uh...
you could distribute it
however you see fit.
So...
Disipio.. you've been
wrongly accused?
Yes, I have been.
And I could help you
with that murder,
'cause I know who did it.
Oh, yeah?
And you'd be willing
to testify to that?
Yes, I will.
I would, definitely.
Well, I think that we
might be able to solve
a lot of your problems.
Rifkin issupposed
to be a real-by-the-booker.
Yeah, he can be
a hard-ass,
but he also can get
a little carried away
with the nightstick,
and you and I both know
he wouldn't want any
of that to come out.
No.
Well, Manny, looks like
it's really up to you now.
I just want 20 percent.
Of all the contracts.
Yeah.
That's fair.
I guess that's fair.
Leo was smart.
He did what I should have
done from the beginning.
it's a little
late for that now.
I'm sure you'll be OK.
Yeah?
Seems like every one's
trying to cut me out.
I can't help you.
Erica, wait.
Erica, wait!
Willie, stop!
Shh, shh.
I love you, Erica.
I'm so sorry.
Don't run away
from me, please.
You're all I have now.
I love you so much.
Where you going?
Huh?
Come here.
You going to see
fucking Leo?!
You know how sick that is,
the two of you,
how fucking sick?
No!
No!
No!
Leave me alone!
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen,
Deputy Chief Disipio,
and honored members
of our police force.
I want you all to know
that I have demanded
an internal investigation
unprecedented
in scope and rigor.
Now, I know
many things can divide us
here in this borough
and in this community,
but your showing up
here tonight
indicates confidence
in our system.
Our internal investigation,
which will be aired
next week,
will show that the claims
of concerned citizens,
as well as the claims
of some of our media,
are totally unfounded.
Our investigation concludes
the suspect that we have
been following for some time
should be cleared
immediately of all charges.
Oh, please.
Not again.
Now, please,
ladies and gentlemen,
please...
Officer.. Excuse me, sir?
We have a report of
an alarm at this location.
Can I see your
license, registration,
and insurance card, please?
Sir?
Get out of the car.
Get out of the car!
Unh!
Go call for backup.
Get backup.
You got it.
What were you doing
in there, huh?
Got anything on you?
As I was saying,
our report, which will be
made public next week,
will show that we have
a great deal of violence
and vandalism
in our subways.
Now, we've made
an unfailing commitment
to all of our public
transportation systems.
We cannot let the violence
of a few of these hooligans
tear at the fabric
of our great city.
I know that
everyone of our hearts
goes out to the family
of the late Mr. Gorwitz.
Mr. Gorwitz's murder
is a true tragedy.
Move aside.
We've shown
time and time again
that we can come together.
And as I look around
the room this evening,
Isee that we--
Mr. And Mrs. Olchin?
Could you come
with us, please?
It's about
your daughter.
I'm very sorry.
She was found
in your house.
She was deceased.
I'm very sorry.
I'm really sorry,
ma'am.
Mom!
Ladies and gentlemen,
just take your seats,
please.
Ladies and gentlemen,
please.
Leo.
Look, um...
I just want to tell you
you got nothing to
worry  about 'cause...
well, I got friends.
And they can
protect us.
Listen, I heard rumors
that some people
from the attorney
general's office
are gonna want
to talk to you,
but you can't lose
your head,
so, you know,
just stick with us.
And, um...
in the future...
you know,
whatever you need.
You coming back inside?
You know,
your mother needs you.
Come on.
I am not
an important person.
My only purpose here today
is to shed some light
on my experience
in a corrupt system.
I know that I have made
my own mistakes through time,
but I have paid
my debts to society.
I hope today to re-enter
the community
as a productive citizen.
That is all I want.
That is all I have ever wanted.
Thank you.
We would like
to thank you, Mr. Handler,
for your courageousness in
coming forward this morning.
I will now ask you
to read into the record
the names of
those individuals
who you contend
are the key members
of this conspiracy.
Mr. Arthur C. Mydanick.
Mr. Seymour Korman.
Mr. Frank H. Olchin.
Mr. Paul Lazzarides.
And Mr. Willie Gutierrez.
I would also like
to finish by saying
that as a product of
my street environment
I am well aware of
the code of silence
that I have just violated.
But many lives have been
destroyed by this system,
and I believe
that in years to come,
my testimony will be
viewed for what it is
and that I will not have
to look back on this day
with any regret.
Thank you.
