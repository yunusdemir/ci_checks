A film by Luis Estrada.
HEROD'S LAW
My God, they linched a mayor
just when the president...
is talking about modernity
and social peace.
Don't fuck this up, Lopez.
Don't worry, Mr. Governor.
We've taken the necessary
steps to deal with it.
I'm talking about the presidency
of Mexico, no less.
If I'm not careful, that asshole
Ruiz Cortinez will beat me to it.
I want to get
through this clean.
If I don't get at least a
ministry, I'm out of the game.
Don't worry, general.
I assure you that you are
valuable to the party.
I'm going to be clear
about this, Lopez.
If you want to be governor,
everything must be resolved.
If people mention our state,
they must speak well of it.
You know better than anyone who
elects who around here.
If you want my job, don't give me
problems like San Pedro.
Lynching a mayor
when president Aleman...
speaks of modernity
and social justice.
Don't fuck this up, Ramirez.
Don't worry, licenciado.
We'll find someone soon.
This has to be solved today.
I need to arrange things
with the governor.
He clearly said
that I've been chosen.
Do get looking.
Find me someone not too bright.
He will hold the post
for three or four months.
What do you think of him?
Who's he?
The least bad,
but he's straight.
He threatened to quit the party.
No, No!
- And this?
- That's "Sticky Fingers".
I doubt he'd accept a shitty
job like mayor of San Pedro.
And this one that looks like
Tin Tan. Vargas?
He's been in the party for years.
He joined when I did.
He's a good man.
He'll probably accept.
What do you mean "good man"?
I mean he's stupid.
He's the one. Go and get him.
Institutional Revolutionary
Party - Juan Vargas.
CLEANING DEPARTMENT SUPERVISOR
Hey!
Good morning.
Ramirez?
Ramirez!
Fucking Vargas, you have to
call me licenciado now. Okay?
It's been a long time.
Is that car yours?
Yes.
Licenciado Lopez sent me.
He wants a word with you.
The governor's secretary?
What about?
You're in a fine mess.
Hurry up. He's waiting for us.
Go in.
Wait for me here.
And behave asshole.
Well, tell him I'll call him.
Good afternoon, Vargas.
- It's an honor, licenciado.
- Sit down.
I'll be straight with you,
Vargas.
As you know, modernity...
has at last come to our country.
We must embody the ideals
of the Revolution...
make president Aleman's
words a reality.
Help the country advance,
stamp out corruption...
especially the mess caused
by those who don't agree.
Certain government workers
don't understand this.
They took advantage
to make business...
and grow rich at
the nation's cost.
This country needs
true patriots.
- People like you.
- Thanks, licenciado.
I'm going to need your help.
Just tell me who I have to kill.
No, no, Vargas.
Times have changed.
You heard what happened in
San Pedro DE los Saguaros?
The people rioted, there was
some kind of problem...
and there's nobody in charge.
We have to appoint...
a temporary mayor who will
keep order until the elections.
Right.
And how can I help, licenciado?
You came short, Ramirez.
Don't be a fool, Vargas.
The party has noticed you
and I'm informing you...
that you are to be
temporary mayor...
of San Pedro DE los Saguaros.
Mayor? Me?
So you see how the Revolution
is fair with people like you.
I trust you totally, Vargas.
I trust you totally.
This is a real opportunity,
maybe even the start...
- ...of a great political career.
- That's right, isn't it?
Go to San Pedro
and fulfill president Aleman's...
and governor Sanchez's promises...
Modernity and social justice.
But listen, I don't want any problems.
If they mention
San Pedro DE los Saguaros...
in the capital, they'd better
say nice things.
No messing things up.
Understood?
Don't worry, licenciado.
How can I thank you?
Thank the party. Remember:
"We owe everything
to the party".
Even better.
Here, take this.
Governor Sanchez himself
gave it me...
so it's sure to bring you
good luck. There.
Thank you, licenciado.
Now all you have to do
is going to work.
Yes, sir.
Ramirez, brother, thank you.
- Thank you.
- Licenciado!
Thank you, licenciado.
Excuse me, licenciado.
Here you go, Ramirez.
President Aleman
gave me this as a gift.
Now it's yours
for finding me that fool.
Nothing more and nothing
less than mayor, honey.
Finally, after so many years
in that party.
It was about time something
good happened to us.
Are you happy, sweetheart?
And this is just the start.
You'll see.
If I do well,
next stop is state deputy.
Then congressman,
my golden dream.
Imagine your name on a plaque
in the National Congress.
Maybe something else.
Senator and Mrs. Vargas.
That doesn't sound bad.
Not bad at all, Mrs. Senator.
Not bad at all.
Excuse me. How far is it to
San Pedro DE los Saguaros?
Good afternoon.
Excuse me, do you speak Spanish?
I think we're lost.
How far is it to
San Pedro DE los Saguaros?
It's right here.
You must be the new mayor.
I've been waiting for you
since yesterday.
I am Carlos Pek, your secretary.
Juan Vargas, at your service.
President Aleman and
governor Sanchez sent me...
to bring modernity
and social justice.
We've arrived.
Welcome madam.
Here?
TOWN HALL
You should go and see
your office, Juan.
What for? This is enough for me.
A fucking little backwater.
We're better off
in the garbage dump.
No, don't say that.
You were nobody at the dump,
here you are the chief.
You are the mayor.
Didn't you hear how they
even called you licenciado?
He did call me licenciado,
didn't he?
Yes!
Do you honestly think
we are better off here?
Of course, honey.
Don't you see?
Here we're important people.
This is just the start,
but we have to be very, very...
smart.
Good morning.
Pek? Pek?
Word is out that there's
a new mayor.
Everyone wants theirs
affairs deal with.
Please tell them
I'll see them later.
Alright, let's get to work.
What's this, Pek?
Unresolved matters, licenciado.
There are many others,
but these are the most urgent.
These are agrarian problems,
this is the...
You know something, Pek?
We should take a stroll...
so I can get to know
the place. Don't you think so?
The village is very small, licenciado.
We come to less
than 100 inhabitants...
most of us are Indians who...
have lived here all our lives.
Good morning.
Don't be offended, licenciado.
They are good people...
but most of them...
don't even speak Spanish.
Really?
Don't they learn it at school?
Licenciado.
Look.
That was the school.
What happened?
They built in the days
of Tata Cardenas.
When the government changed...
They stopped paying the
teacher and one day he left.
The same old story licenciado.
What about the doors,
the windows and everything?
That was one of your colleagues.
What did he do?
One day, the bastard sold them
along with the blackboard...
benches and everything of value.
Just like that?
He didn't sell the walls 'cause
nobody wanted to buy them.
He'd have sold the whole
village given the chance.
This has happened with every
mayor we've had, licenciado.
Listen, Pek. What happened
to my predecessor?
Why did he quit?
Licenciado.
Didn't they tell you?
They cut his head off
with a machete!
What?
They cut it off, and that's
not the end of the story...
of the mayors of San Pedro.
Another was hanged,
another almost burned alive.
Three mayors killed in 5 years.
Why would they send me?
I don't know...
but they must have done
something wrong, right?
Who knows? But...
just in case.
Good morning.
What's this, Pek?
Manslaughter.
Licenciado Vargas.
This is Dr. Morales.
- Pleased to meet you, doctor.
- Six bullets.
This, like all the problems
in San Pedro...
is due to that brothel.
I suppose you know it.
No, No...
Whit this are eight dead men,
not counting the diseases...
half the village
is infected with.
Something must be done
about that place!
Don't worry, doctor. I'll take
the necessary steps to close...
It's your duty!
I've only arrived. I promise...
Look, it's very easy.
Do your job and I assure you
everything will be fine.
If not, I promise you'll regret
ever coming to San Pedro.
Who's this man, Pek?
Dr. Morales is someone
to watch out for, licenciado.
He's been the PAN candidate
for mayor four times...
and always complains
about fraud.
Can you believe it?
From now on, he's going to be
your worst nightmare.
So it seems.
You can't imagine it.
What shall we do, Pek?
He had no relatives.
I suppose it's up to us.
We don't open until eight.
I want to speak with your boss.
She's sleeping.
Tell her it's the new mayor.
Wait here.
She says you can come in.
Miss, ah, how much
are you charging?
What can I do for you?
Good morning. Sorry to wake
you up at this hour, dona...
- Dofia Lupe.
- Juan Vargas, at your service.
Sit down, licenciado.
You get lost.
Sit down.
Fancy a drink?
Not during working hours.
Well, a little shot
never did any harm.
So you're the new mayor.
At your service, madam.
And the thing is.
How can I say?
Seems that a few people aren't
happy about your business.
Ah, licenciado, you're
just like the others...
coming here
for your bribe, right?
No, madam, nothing of the kind.
- It's just that people...
- People or Dr. Morales?
That old son of a bitch
won't leave me alone.
He turns the Indians
and everyone against me.
It's not just the doctor.
There's a corpse outside.
Someone who was shot here yesterday.
A corpse?
No, licenciado,
someone's pulling your leg.
- Nothing happened here.
- The thing is...
No, licenciado,
everything is in order.
Don Alfredo Garcia
who was mayor before you...
gave me all the permits.
Are you going to
take this or not?
No, madam. There are things
which one can't do.
Why the hell not? You're
all the same, licenciado.
You're not telling me
you're different.
No, dona Lupe, how can you say that?
I must shut this place down
for the good of the village.
Look, you fucking idiot.
Let's stop this right now. If
you have anything else to say...
tell it to the priest.
He calls the shots here.
- The priest?
- Yes, the priest, you heard me.
- Get out of here!
- Excuse me for bothering you.
- Get out.
- Excuse me.
- Get going.
- Goodbye.
And you, idiots. Get inside.
What are you doing there?
Excuse me, madam.
Dona Lupe,
what about the corpse?
Stick it up your ass!
Let's see, pal.
There you go.
You said so yourself, father.
The flesh is weak and
there is much temptation.
Yes, but you get carried away.
- But, father, you know.
- What does your husband say?
Nothing. He doesn't
pay me any attention.
Ego te absolvum.
For penitence say 3
Holy Fathers and 3 Hall Marys.
Oh, and give me a peso
for everyone of your sins.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Chencha.
May I help you?
Good morning, Father.
I'm Juan Vargas, at your
service. The new mayor.
I know that. I was going
to come and see you, but...
I've had a lot of work.
What can I do for you?
I've got a lot
of problems, father.
- Spiritual ones?
- I wish they were.
I've got a corpse outside.
I just saw dona Lupe.
She told me to talk to you.
Not in here.
We better go outside.
Hey, my son...
how much does a Packard
like this go for?
I really don't know, father.
But what shall we do about
the corpse? He's starting to stink.
That's the authorities' problem.
I just do the blessing.
What about the brothel, father?
Dona Lupe said
you'd given her permission.
Ah, dona Lupe!
Did you two work something out?
What?
Did you come to an agreement?
Father, I'm not like that.
- Ah, come on.
- I swear it, father.
Don't swear!
You think this shepherd
doesn't know his flock?
Well, she did make me an offer,
but that's not why I came...
to San Pedro DE los Saguaros.
You should've taken the money.
San Pedro lacks many things...
and dona Lupe performs
an important social function.
That's five pesos
for the blessings.
Thanks, father.
Being mayor is exhausting, Pek.
I never imagined
it would be so difficult.
It's been a bad day, licenciado.
But don't give up. It's a matter
of solving the problems...
bit by bit.
You know what? Just before I
came here, I heard a speech...
by the president that gave me
someone ideas, it could work.
Tell me what you think.
First...
we'd have to fix the school.
Then pave the streets,
install drainage.
People just shit in...
If you'll allow me
a few words, licenciado.
Wait. Don't distract me,
I'll loose the ideas.
Something grand so that
people will remember us.
A dam or a highway linking
San Pedro DE los Saguaros...
to the capital.
What do you think?
They're great ideas,
licenciado...
but there's a problem.
What?
Seven pesos.
It's all that's left
of the budget.
The last mayor...
he spent it.
And since then, they haven't
given us anything.
I thought maybe they'd sent
something with you.
I'm not hungry.
You're not going to solve
anything this way, Juan.
We have to think something.
You can't go back
to the garbage dump.
Without money
I can't do anything.
Go and see licenciado Lopez
first thing tomorrow.
Tell him about the problems...
and ask him for a larger budget.
But he told me he didn't
want any problems.
But he didn't tell you where
he was sending us either.
Go see him, play the martyr.
Take him a present,
that always works.
I know just what to give him.
In conclusion, president
Miguel Aleman declared...
to the workers and peasant's
sectors that this devaluation...
was painful but necessary,
and insisted that by facing...
our problems, we guarantee
a bright future for everyone.
No doubt there are people who
knows how to do things well.
How can I tell licenciado Lopez
I can't do the job?
I'm sticking out my neck.
I'd rather be in your shoes.
Eat and sleep, sleep and eat.
Eat and sleep.
That's life.
Fuck it.
- What?
- What happened to your car?
That junk heap broke down.
Let's see if I can help you.
Get in.
Start it up.
Stop, SIOP-
I think the engine's fucked.
Don't tell me.
It can be fixed, but...
it won't be cheap.
Go ahead. I'll pay anything.
Again, carefully.
He who knows, knows.
What do you say?
How much do I owe you?
Hey, for a Mexican friend,
just 100 dollars.
One hundred dollars?
Shit, shit. But I don't
have that kind of money.
- Look, this is all I have.
- And the pig?
- No, It belongs to my boss.
- Well, give me that.
But you'll leave me broke.
Look, this is what we'll do.
Go to San Juan DE los Camotes,
and wait for me there.
I'm the mayor, see?
Emilio Gabriel Fernandez.
Figueroa, at your service.
I'll pay you there, okay?
- What?
- I said it's okay, pal.
Don't worry. We Mexicans
are people of our word.
I'll pay you on time.
Thanks a lot.
Have a good trip.
Fucking gringo,
same as the rest.
He wanted to trick us.
But... they don't know that we
Mexicans are better fuckers.
What's this, Vargas?
A present from
San Pedro DE los Saguaros.
Get that swine out of here?
So, what's new?
Well, licenciado,
I don't know where to begin.
I'd like to see if it's
possible for you...
to give me a bigger budget.
No, no, Varguitas, no.
The elections are coming up...
and all the funds
must go to the party...
to that there are no surprises.
Ask me for anything. Anything
at all, except that. Not now.
Well, since you're giving me
the chance.
How about moving me
to another town?
Fucking hell, you really
turned out to be a wise guy.
No way. It's Herod's Law here.
Either you fuck them
or you get fucked.
But there's no money left.
This makes it very difficult.
We need so many things.
Imagine if everyone asked me
the same as you.
It'd never be enough. When
it runs out, it runs out.
To be honest, licenciado, I
planned to do as you told me...
that modernity and
social justice stuff, but...
the truth is, it's difficult.
I'll give you some advice.
Sit down.
Here you go.
Those are the federal
and state laws.
- Do I have to read it all?
- No, no, Vargas.
This will earn you your money.
If you know how to use it,
you can get money out of all.
You've got fines, taxes, license fees.
Use the law to your
benefit, and you're made.
In this country,
honesty gets you nowhere.
You'll get me into
deeper trouble.
They don't respect
authority in San Pedro.
Authority?
Come here.
I'll show you authority.
Stand here.
Hit me here.
No, no, licenciado.
Go on, man, don't be afraid.
Hit me here.
Come here, Vargas.
Did you understand?
I'm your boss.
Your superior. Get it?
Anyone who breaks the law
is messing with authority.
They'll be punished.
I'm the authority.
Got it?
But the people in San Pedro
are wild, licenciado.
Did you know they cut
the last mayor's head off?
They cut his head off?
That's easily solved.
Take it.
Go on, take it.
If they threaten you with a
machete, show them the gun...
and see if they still
give you a hard time.
Keep it, man, keep it.
Put it away.
Don't kill anyone.
Remember, everything
in this book that says...
Executive, Legislative, and
Judicial Powers... that's you.
The maximum authority of
San Pedro of whatever...?
DE los Saguaros.
San Pedro DE los Aguados,
you got it.
Go on, and put the gun away.
- Thank you, licenciado.
- There you go.
Take this little book and
this gun and enforce authority.
Thank you very much.
- Excuse me.
- Go ahead.
Gloria!
Sweetheart, I'm back!
- How did it go, my love?
- Very well.
Are we moving
to another village?
No...
Then they raised your budget?
No, sweetheart, look.
- What's that for?
- Lopez gave it to me.
You're going to
bring us problems.
No, my love. On the contrary,
we'll solve them with this.
I know how, I study the law
and learn to use the gun.
Fine, but put it down.
It's making me nervous.
My pistol makes you nervous?
"This are crimes against
moral of fences..."
prostitution...
endocinity...
and white slavery...
Sweetheart!
Sweetheart, do you know
what "en-do-ci-ni-ty" means?
No, I don't. Let me sleep.
You think I'm stupid?
Always trying
to sneak away, bitch!
What were you thinking?
Fuck! I just look away,
and you are trying to leave.
What were you thinking?
You think I'm stupid?
Get inside, you bitch!
Ungrateful little tarts!
Nobody else would feed the pigs.
- There you go!
- Good morning, dona Lupe.
Good morning.
What do you want, bastard?
With all due respect, I have
an order to close this house.
According to the penal code,
you're breaking several laws.
Selling alcohol
without a license.
Involvement in manslaughter...
mplagiarism, kidnapping,
"lenocininity".
Rape, corruption of minors,
threats...
violation of the inhumation
laws, white slavery...
plus, beating your
employees like that.
Look, this is my property,
right, licenciadito?
In my house I'll beat up anyone
I fucking like, how about that?
Look, dona Lupe.
Here you can read the laws...
I don't give a shit
about your fucking laws!
Please, dona Lupe
have some respect.
I represent the
nation's authority.
- You don't get it!
- Dona Lupe...
You don't get it.
Please, dona Lupe.
Please, dona Lupe!
I want us to communicate
like decent people. I...
You think you scare me?
You need balls to
use that gun, asshole!
Please!
You coward! Come back here,
you son of a fucking bitch!
Asshole!
You son of bitch!
What's up licenciado?
If they ask for me,
tell them I've gone.
No, that I don't
work here anymore.
Are you sure it was in the leg?
I think so, sweetheart.
Let's go.
So what? That's what your
boss told you to do, right?
Yes. Something like that.
You're the authority, honey.
They have to respect you.
It's just that this lady...
Let's see, here.
Get back to work.
- Is your idiot boss in?
- It's dona Lupe.
Come in, come in.
Good morning, dona Lupe.
Come in.
How have you been?
Pek, please leave us.
You too, get out.
Go and see if it's raining.
Please, madam.
You're looking very well.
- I wanted to apologize.
- Cut the crap, Vargas.
Let's get to the point.
How much do you want
to leave me alone?
No, dona Lupe,
the law must be obeyed.
Then just look the other way.
Here.
Your business is very
crooked, dona Lupe.
Only you know that, because
you read that huge book.
Here's more money.
You promise nobody will know,
dona Lupe? You promise?
Nobody will find out.
So now we understand
each other, licenciado.
You're a toug her cookie
than I expected.
Let me help you, dona Lupe.
Get off, I can manage.
And you show you I don't bear
a grudge, come to the brothel.
I'll invite you one of my girls.
Thank you, dona Lupe,
I'll come by.
Nosy little tarts! Look at you!
Afternoon.
"Entry forbidden to Women,
Minors, Soldiers in Uniform...
Animals and Indians".
Fifty?
But how?
I don't make that much.
Well, how much can you manage?
Well...
Maybe twenty, once in a while.
Good.
We'll discuss your
takes later, eh?
Thank you.
That sign by the door.
It's hard to understand, confusing.
Take it down.
Just look at that.
Pek...
fine this asshole.
What for, licenciado?
Let me think.
Look him up and we'll
decide later.
Don't let him out until he pays
a fine of five pesos... no, six.
Juan, come to bed!
What's that?
Nothing.
Where did you get all the money?
It's not mine,
don't get me wrong.
It's money from
contributions, taxes, fines.
They're saying something
else in town.
Especially Dr. Morales.
He's going around saying
you're the worst one yet.
Be careful, dear.
That old bastard
could ruin everything.
I must tell him that this
is for the good of the people.
I got it. Why don't we organize
a dinner party...
and invite all the important
people of San Pedro?
We have money now.
That's what all
politicians do, right?
Okay.
Whatever you want, dear.
Good evening, friend.
I looked for you everywhere.
Where's my money?
How are you doing, Sam?
My name isn't Sam.
It's Robert...
Robert Smith.
Nice to meet you, madam.
What's this, Juan?
Gloria, this is my friend,
Robert.
He almost saved my life.
Hey, I want my money.
You owe me, remember?
I want you to pay me now.
It's late and I don't
want to be on the road.
No, no way.
You stay here with us.
Gloria, fix us some dinner.
They won't say Mexicans
are bad hosts.
Alright, I'll stay.
And the money?
Look, friend. The country is
having economic problems.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
Go and get your things.
Okay.
Where is he going to sleep?
Look, I've got a good
proposal for you.
Help me and I swear I'll pay you
everything. Plus interest.
What is it?
You play engineer and help me
modernize this village.
These people have money
under their mattresses.
Yeah, sure, but I want my money.
I'm not talking about
100 dollars...
You could be making
a grand of more.
Maybe. But I want 50%
of everything that you get.
Fuck!
I'll give you 20%.
Fifty or nothing.
Okay.
As you know, we Mexicans
are men of our word.
Here, disfrustful paleface.
Here it is on paper.
Is it clear about the interest?
Yes, It's all there.
Okay.
Okay, friend.
To our partnership.
What?
Partners. Cheers!
Cheers, partner.
- Tell me, Mr. Gringo.
- Yes?
Is it true your countrymen
are still very angry about...
the expropriation
of the oll business?
Well, yes, a bit. But they know
that in time we'll get it back.
And more. Much more.
What did he said?
He says that in the US
they think we're a dictatorship.
- And I agree with him.
- The perfect dictatorship!
No, no. Forgive me, but that's
why we had a revolution.
In Mexico the vote is respected.
It's not out fault that people
always vote for my party.
If there was real
democracy in Mexico...
the president would be a priest.
Don't exaggerate doctor...
or father Perez here
would be governor.
Good idea, my son. Good idea.
And you, you were involved.
What do you think, Pek?
To be honest, the Revolution
brought many changes.
But we didn't fight it
to suit a few politicians.
Unfortunately, the poorest
are still just as poor.
Yes, yes, Pek.
You're quite right.
Fortunately,
we made of the Revolution...
the basis for our Institutions.
And the country's future
has never been brighter.
Please, licenciado, what
future are you talking about?
The government is in the
hands of a bunch of crooks.
Your boss is the worst
of them all.
You are a fine example
of the scalawags that govern us.
Tell us, what have you done
for the good of San Pedro?
Doctor, let me pour
you another drink.
No honey. Sit down.
Ladies...
gentlemen...
that is why
I've invited you here.
As you know, I went to the
capital a few days ago...
to meet with the
secretary of government.
And discuss the serious
problems of the village.
And I would like
to inform you that...
modernity will at last come
to San Pedro DE los Saguaros.
We'll make the promises of our
president Aleman come true.
And how are you
going to do this?
I have specific instructions to
start right away by bringing...
electricity to San Pedro.
And here, straight from the US
is engineer Robert Smith.
And that's nothing.
Once these works are done...
president Aleman himself
will inaugurate them.
Cheers, friends!
How thrilling.
Why didn't you tell me before?
Sit down, honey. Cheers!
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
Hey, dear? What?
Didn't you get
a bit carried away?
About what?
What you said about
electricity and the president.
No, honey. It's all true, I spoke
to the governor's secretary.
Tell them to pull harder,
Mr. Pek.
As you see, doctor,
my party always delivers.
You should have closed
that brothel first.
And in good time.
First things first.
And the first thing,
my friends, is progress.
The future of our nation!
- There's your great work.
- Fucking gringo!
Sorry, Mr. Mayor.
It was these Indians.
This never happens
with American workers.
- Go on! Help them!
- Let's try again!
Pull it.
Afternoon, dona Lupe.
You know what day is today?
And where is Esmeralda?
That son of a bitch!
Fucking shameless dwarf!
How does that asshole
manage to be so brazen?
You don't have money for
taxes. But what about this?
Pay me.
- To you too, idiot!
- Take a hike!
What?
Listen, who the hell
is going to pay me?
Show me some respect, dona Lupe.
That is one thing,
but this is something else.
I'm here for taxes.
How can I pay you, asshole?
Since you came here
I've lost all my clients.
Do what you want.
I have nothing to pay you with.
Well, dona Lupe, maybe
we can work something out.
I'm feeling very romantic.
- Alright, let's go.
- No dona Lupe.
Son of a fucking bitch!
You've got no idea
how everyone has changed.
The only thing anyone talks
about is the president's visit?
What are they saying?
They're very excited
about the electricity.
Everyone speaks
well about you, love.
They say you're
the first mayor...
who's going to
fulfill his promises.
I'm excited too.
Juan, I'm preparing
you a surprise...
so you make a good
impression on the president.
What is it?
No, I told you it's a surprise.
I'll show you
when it's finished.
Oh, Juan...
if you keep on like this,
you won't be just congressman.
You'll be much more.
And...
I also got a present for you.
Couldn't you give it
to me tomorrow, honey?
I had a very tiring day.
Wait, wait.
Wait, wait.
Just what I told you, father,
He's not only corrupt,
but lazy too.
I'm sure the whole
thing is a farce.
Excuse me, doctor,
what are you talking about?
I heard you're in business
with dona Lupe.
And we're prepared to take the
necessary steeps to sack you.
Excuse me, doctor
but the law authorizes me...
The law? The law you apply
is a farce.
An excuse to steal
money from the people.
Tell him, tell him
what we found out.
I don't want to get involved
in your business, but...
the Indians have complained
to Dr. Morales about you.
Excuse me, father, but I simply
apply what it says here.
Do you think I go around
making up laws?
Well...
I've warned you.
Either things change
or you'll hear from me!
Nothing satisfies this guy.
That's the way opposition is.
They criticize everything.
Look, I'm going to give you some advice.
You got to be careful and don't
go waving that pistol around.
Put it away!
I swear that he's talking it
the wrong way.
Don't swear in vain.
I can help you with
Dr. Morales...
but you have to help me too.
Whatever you say, father.
I'd be very grateful.
Well, you know...
I want to buy myself a car.
- A car?
- Don't worry.
I have some savings.
I want something modest.
Maybe an old Ford...
or a Packard like yours.
It's a good car, right?
Here, father.
But, my son...
this won't even buy me a tire.
Well, here.
Those who repent...
go to Heaven.
Help me buy my car...
and you won't have any problems.
Good bless you, son.
Good look, father.
Fucking priest!
- Good morning, dona Lupe.
- What's good about it?
Get my money ready while
I have a quickie with Perlita.
This bullshit is over,
you son of a bitch!
What's up dona Lupe?
You just don't understand,
asshole! Pancho!
- Pancho!
- Shit!
Look, this is the asshole
I told you about.
- Hello buddy.
- Show him who's in change now.
Throw him to the pigs!
- Dona Lupe, dona Lupe!
- To the pigs!
- What's happening, dona Lupe?
- Squeal like a pig!
I'm the representative of the law!
My ass! Squeal like a pig!
Give him a good kicking!
My love! What happened to you?
I feel down somewhere.
- What?
- You smell like a pig.
Fuck you!
What's that?
Isn't it beautiful?
Bobby brought it.
Hey, wait!
Today's Thursday and you said
I'd get an advance.
Don't bother me now, gringo.
Leave him alone, Bobby.
Don't you see how he is?
Poor thing.
Well, to cheer you up,
I'll show you the surprise...
I'm making for the president.
Surprise!
Do you like it?
- It is very nice.
- Bobby helped me.
I'm glad you like it, dear.
Now I'll show you
how we dance in America.
I'm telling you this bitch
is fucking with me.
Don't go soft on them or
they'll do whatever they want.
Take care of that.
Because I've seen how you...
Vargas, you're not planning
on killing me too, are you, fucker?
No, no, please!
Look, I'll give you everything
I've got. Look, look!
I've got more money
in the house.
Put the gun down, you're too
much of an idiot to handle it.
Please, don't kill me!
I've got news for you,
dona Lupe.
Good news and bad news.
The good news is that those
who repent go to heaven.
And the bad news?
It's your turn
to face Herod's Law.
There, you old witch!
That's for disrespecting me.
And that's for not respecting
this nation's Institutions.
And that's for...
your dirty mouth.
Juan!
Juan, wake up!
What? What's the matter, honey?
I've been trying to wake you
all day, but I couldn't.
Where were you last night?
Well, I couldn't sleep and
I took care of some business.
Don't play dumb, Juan.
I know everything.
What do you know?
That you spend all day
with dona Lupe's whores...
and one day you'll catch
a disease off them.
My love! No way!
Honorable Congress
of the Union...
fellow congressmen...
citizen and countrymen.
I appreciate the distinction
from my party.
My party?
My party!
Gloria, Gloria,
have you seen my PRI pin?
Maybe one of your
girlfriends has it.
- Son of a bitch.
- No, not son of a bitch.
My party.
My party.
My pin!
My pin!
What's this, Pek?
Some locals brought them.
I went out to tell you.
But they are dead, Pek!
Where did they find them?
- In the deep creek.
- And what else? Talk to me!
Some peasants took their
animals out found them.
I think it was a robbery,
licenciado.
They had nothing
of value on them.
- This is very strange, Pek.
- Yes.
Go and take a statement
from the peasants...
and see if they know
anything else.
Yes, licenciado.
Funnaxfim Lung
I'm going...
to the port.
Where these is...
a golden ship...
that will take me...
I'm going now.
I just came...
to say goodbye.
Goodbye...
woman.
Goodbye...
forever.
Rest in peace.
Thank you for coming, father.
Is this all the salvation
of a soul is worth to you?
Dona Lupe left us nothing.
Even her shoes got stolen.
Good bye, licenciado.
Don't worry, father,
I'll take care.
Goodbye, my children.
God bless you.
Girls...
you know how sorry I am.
Dona Lupe was like...
like...
like a sister to me.
Always so happy, so kind.
But death comes
when least expect it.
Thanks for coming, licenciado.
You can count on me
for anything.
Hey, listen. When do we
reopen the business, girls?
Dolls!
See dona Lupe? You never
know who you're working for.
Afternoon.
What's up, licenciado?
You found out something about
the murder of dona Lupe?
We're on it.
There are several suspects.
Everything points
to crime of passion.
Crime of passion?
What about the robbery?
That was a read herring.
But I didn't come
to discuss that.
I want you to do me a favor.
But I've already paid
you for the month.
No, no. Nothing to do with that.
I'm here to make
a business proposal.
I've got to find a place
for dona Lupe's girls...
and I thought we could
make a partnership.
No, licenciado.
My business isn't prostitution.
I guarantee you, we'll
get loaded. What do you say?
No, lic.
0k!
Cheers.
Look! There's my boss.
He'll make it as governor.
Well it won't be easy for him.
Terrazas is related
to the president.
He's got the party base
behind him, even the unions.
My chief won't allow it
he's a good bastard.
If he wins. I'll be
in the big leagues. Cheers!
Pek, Lady Luck
is smilling on us.
Some one did us a big favor
getting rid of dona Lupe.
And that's not all;
Our boss is set to be governor.
Nothing can stop us.
Good afternoon, doctor.
You most be pleased.
You were the only person
who wanted dona Lupe gone.
And now it's going to be real
hard for her to come back.
Are you insinuating I had
something to do with that?
You were the only one who had
anything against her, right?
That's a lie! You are
a shameless opportunist!
Don't get excited, doctor.
I'm sure that you killed her.
But tou'll be sorry, licenciado.
You'll be sorry!
This is your end!
Listen, licenciado,
this isn't a good idea.
Hardly anyone can read here.
It doesn't matter, Pek.
It's got to have some use.
- Dona Lupe. Fifty pesos.
- What's that?
He's asking what it says.
Didn't I tell you.
Come.
Only you could suggest
that the doctor was guilty.
They're going to fire me
because of that bastard.
When Lopez is about
to be made governor.
Oh, Juan,
we have to do something.
Let him calm down.
But tomorrow morning
go and apologize.
Humiliate yourself if you must,
but calm him down.
Who knows what that bastard
is capable of?
Make something up. Tell him
you've found a suspect.
Hello, girl, is your boss in?
- Good morning, Rosita.
- Good morning.
I'm sorry to be here
so early without warning...
but I must speak
with your husband.
Chencha, go and get
some firewood!
Go on, stop hanging around!
Come in, licenciado. Come in,
make yourself at home.
Thank you.
Please excuse my appearance,
licenciado.
- Rosita, is your husband here?
- No, he isn't.
Do you know where he is?
He was very angry.
He couldn't sleep all night.
He woke up very early
and went to the capital.
He went to complain about you
to your bosses.
Rosita, it was all
a misunderstanding.
I came to tell him
we've got a suspect...
No! Really?
- I have to go, Rosita.
- No, no, licenciado.
You are going to stay here.
I'll take your mind off it.
That's fine, my child.
You can go.
Now... what's up?
You must help me father.
I'm about to be unemployed,
and you without a car!
- Why?
- Fucking Dr. Morales.
We had an argument and he
went to talk to my bosses.
But we must stop him
or we're fucked?
Forgive him, Lord.
Help me, father.
What should we do?
J... K...
M, M, M, M.
M. Martinez.
Morales, Morales... doctor.
All the stuff about his wife,
but everyone knows that.
Ah, here it is. This will fix
him, but it's going to cost you.
What is it, father?
You remember the girl
who works for them, right?
"No once, but many times, at
nightfall Dr. Morales violently...
entered my room
to abuse me sexually".
Write down her details
and you'll sign as witnesses.
But, licenciado,
isn't this a bit exaggerated?
It wasn't exactly
what the girl said.
Isn't it true, Chencha?
Pek, we cannot allow a
pervert like him to go free.
We must act decisively.
Now I'm sure this doctor...
is involved in
the murder of dona Lupe.
My husband's right, Pek.
We can't leave this poor girl
with that old pervert.
I think Chencha
should stay with us, Juan.
She can help me at home.
No, no, no.
I know who'll take care
of her better than anyone.
I'm very sorry, doctor...
but licenciado Lopez
won't be able to see you today.
But I've been waiting all day.
I must speak with him.
I have something
important to tell him.
I tell him. But if you like,
come back tomorrow...
and maybe he'll have time.
Fucking PAN members!
- What does that asshole want?
- The usual.
He says Vargas of San Pedro
is pocketing and...
he's made a fortune in that
fucking village we sent him to.
You know.
Licenciado...
why don't you go home?
I'll stand guard here.
No, no, no.
I'm not moving from here.
I don't know why, Ramirez,
but I think today's the day.
But, licenciado, you haven't
eaten or slept in three days.
I think that...
Yes!
At your orders, general.
Are you sure? But, general...
Yes, yes. Don't worry.
I'm a party man.
I know the rules.
Thank you for calling.
Fucking shitty party!
What happened, licenciado?
Terrazas got the nomination
in the capital!
Now we're fucked!
If Dr. Morales wasn't
in trouble with the law...
he wouldn't be living
in a shitty village like this.
No, licenciado.
Do you believe that
about the girls?
Six girls have denounced him.
But he seemed so decent
and educated, I never thought...
The PAN members are
just hypocrites.
Licenciado!
Forgive the intrusion,
but we've caught a suspect.
What?
You better confess, Filemon!
I swear on my mother,
I didn't do anything, boss!
I swear somebody
put me those shoes.
Don't write that, Pek.
I think you need something
to help you remember.
Go inside and see if
you can find a bottle, Pek.
Confess and I'll pay
you well, Filemon.
Confess, asshole!
Yes, yes!
I did it!
What happened, licenciado?
- Nothing, nothing.
- What's going on, Juan?
Nothing, honey. Go back inside.
Write it down, he confessed.
On thursday morning,
around seven o'clock...
Dr. Morales sent for him...
and offered him...
twenty pesos...
and a bottle to do a little job.
Sons of bitches!
They want to send me
as ambassador to Bolivia.
Me! The party's founder!
That's how those assholes
licenciaditos pay me back!
They want to cut me out so
they can do their businesses...
without sharing the pie!
But what do we do? We're not
going to sit and wait.
Of course not, Lopez!
We'll form a new party.
The Party
of the Real Revolution.
You'll see the faces
of those assholes!
And I swear in six years time
I'll have their asses!
I'll be president!
But that's a long time. What
do we do in the meantime?
Give them a scare, Lopez.
Solve it like we used to
in the old days.
Come on, Filemon!
Stop looking so sad.
I know what's bothering you.
Look what I brought you.
Go right ahead.
I'm sorry. Here.
There you go.
Boss, I swear to God
I didn't do anything.
You know better than I
where those shoes came from.
I found your pin
among the bodies.
Look, if you let me go, I won't
tell anybody. Ls swear, boss.
Look, I've got a pal in jail.
I'll tell him you are my friend
so he'll take care of you.
What do you say?
Go ahead.
Fucking Filemon,
you're really a good guy.
I need a piss. How about you?
Come on, Filemon.
I can't help you with that.
There.
You're a good guy, Filemon.
Fucking Filemon.
Look what you made me do.
I'm telling you again, Sharkey.
You can't let me down.
When Terrazas gets out of the car,
you go near him, Negro...
and you shoot him!
If they catch you...
say it was an accident.
When I become governor...
you'll be out of jail
and stinking rich.
And you, Sharkey...
you know well.
My future is on your hands.
Let's go to work.
Are you sure, licenciado?
With all due respect,
I think it's very risky...
killing a candidate
in broad daylight.
We go not choice, Ramirez.
The dice are rolling.
I'm going.
Not that one, damn Negro.
Play the same one.
Fucking Filemon!
Look, Perlita.
It's like when you
have an asshole client...
and he asks you
to do something Kinky?
Would you do it?
Do you know what "Kinky" means?
Sometimes you have to do
things you don't like.
That's Herod's fucking law.
And the girls?
Girls? Girls?
How is Chenchita doing?
Did you think about it, girls?
Five percent of what you
earn is yours to keep.
Great business!
We're not sure, licenciado.
Look, my clears, you can't run
this business by yourselves.
I'll be your man...
once my boss is governor.
Fucking Filemon!
I miss you already, bastard.
I didn't mean to.
Play it again, Negro!
Negro!
Negro!
Girls!
Girls!
Girls!
Licenciado, you are a day early.
How did it go?
Fine, Pek.
What about the doctor?
He hasn't come back yet.
But there are more
accusations against him.
- Do you want to see them?
- Later, I'm not in the mood.
Motherfuckers!
No, no, love.
This isn't what is seems.
Don't speak in English to me,
asshole!
This is the end of
the external debt, gringo!
Go, Bobby! Go before
he comes around.
I want to explain
all to you, love.
It's not what you think.
The gringo forced me
because of what you owed him.
It was horrible, love.
He insisted that I pay him.
I said we had no money and
he got really violent with me.
He tore off my dress.
It was horrible, love.
Poor little thing.
I understand, baby.
These fucking gringos
are son of bitches.
But you are...
you're a fucking bitch!
Whore!
- Stop it!
- Come here, you bitch!
Come here!
Now you'll see, bitch!
Juan.
Juan!
I'm checking if that fucking
gringo didn't rob me.
I already apologize, Juan.
You went with the hookers
in that brothel...
and I never said a word.
You can't keep me tied up
here like a dog.
Don't mention those
treacherous sluts!
And don't mention dogs; They're faithful.
Licenciado. Licenciado.
Licenciado, things
are getting out of hand.
Calm down, Pek.
What's up?
Dr. Morales is back and
the locals want to lynch him.
Licenciado.
That fucking oldman!
Juan.
Juan! Juan!
Juan!
Take them away, Pek.
Tell them to go home.
I'll take care of it.
Open the door, doctor!
Licenciado Vargas,
are they gone?
Yes, they are gone. Move aside.
Doctor, for your own sake,
I advise you to leave town.
- But why?
- It's been discovered...
that you were the intellectual
assassin of dona Lupe.
We have proof
and a signed confession.
That's a lie!
Who would dare to accuse me?
You're also accused of
corrupting minors and rape.
Your servant told us everything.
- My little girl. I can't be.
- Chencha?
Doctor, you'd get at least
40 years for this.
But to show you
how generous I am...
I'll give you till
dawn to leave town...
or I'll wash my hands.
Let's continue.
"In every trial
the criminal order will..."
That's useless too.
Write this down, Pek:
Article Number... whatever.
Given that recent events have
severely affected the revenue...
of the municipality, it is
decreed that as of today...
9th of October of 1949,
without exception...
all the inhabitants
of San Pedro DE los Saguaros...
must pay an extra tax
on their lands...
as well as for cows, pigs,
donkeys, turkeys, hens...
and for all other animals
known or yet to be discovered.
Gee, licenciado,
everyone's very poor already.
It isn't right
to be so hard on them.
Don't exaggerate, Pek.
It's for the community's good.
Once I'm governor and you're
mayor do whatever you want.
Don't dristract me
or I'll lose my inspiration.
Let's continue. As of today...
the term of office for local
mayors shall be extended...
from six to twelve...
I"IO...
to twenty years...
with four possibilities
of reelection.
You never know.
Two hens.
What did he says? What?
He has nothing left.
Maybe he can pay you
after the harvest.
No! Tell him I'm sorry, Pek!
We won't detain the progress
of the majority for a minority.
Lock him up. Next.
Look, licenciado Vargas...
fire me if you want...
but I can't be an accomplice
to all this bullshit.
You're indeed the worst mayor
we've ever had!
What did you say, Pek?
Don't disrespect me
in front of the people.
I'm sorry, licenciado.
Sorry my ass!
Let's talk about it inside.
And you wait here!
Damn fucked up village!
And to think I was going
to make you mayor, asshole.
Open up!
Get in there.
Subversive old bastard!
Fucking moaning Indians!
You're holding back
social progress, assholes!
It's your own fault.
I wasn't making enough,
licenciado.
I offered you a deal
and you turned it down.
Get the money
and you can reopen.
See what happens when
you think about politics?
You didn't take care
of business.
Looks like the bullets
are flying again.
Fuck! Why didn't you tell me
my boss didn't get nominated?
He can still make it
if the candidate dies.
I bet it was Lopez
who had him killed.
You're mad, asshole.
Those things never
happen in my party.
Who knows? Anything is
possible in politics, licenciado.
Be careful.
See you.
Good luck, brother.
"At the scene of the murder
attempt, the police assist...
Terrazas, who is taken
to the emergency room".
My boss? No way!
Remember the words
of our Lord, my son.
You should forgive your wife.
Forgiveness is the only thing
that gives soul peace.
Shut up! What do you
know about women?
They're all bitches!
Leave her chained up
if you like...
but forgive her.
Have you heard that three
more families left town?
Yes, yes. Don't worry about it.
How can I not worry?
You're acting like a monster.
Not, really; Father.
Don't pretend.
You've never had it so good.
But now that I think it over,
keep worrying.
If something happens to me,
you'll be in deep trouble.
Anyway, I repented
so I can go to Heaven.
See you, father.
Juan...
you can't keep me
like this forever.
You're right, honey.
Fix me some dinner.
Look, look!
All this could have been yours.
Now what's the matter?
You want to poison me,
don't you?
No!
You're going insane, asshole!
Shut up!
Don't disrespect me, bitch!
You fucking bitch!
Be very careful not
to do anything stupid.
Oh, fuck!
Stop! I said stop!
I didn't do anything.
What's the matter
with you, Vargas?
Sharkey, my friend.
Friend, my ass.
Licenciado Lopez
wants a word. Go on!
We're in a hurry. Come on!
Move it!
Yes, licenciado Lopez.
I think Mr. Vargas
has gone a little bit insane.
He treats all the
locals very badly.
Here he is, boss. He tried
to run as soon as he saw me.
Licenciado!
To what do I owe the honor?
Nice to see you.
What the hell
happened here, Vargas?
This man told me about
all the crap that you've been up to.
What have you told him, Pek?
About the doctor? Dona Lupe?
Don't play dumb, Vargas!
Look how you got this place.
This doctor came to see me
and said you were up to...
all sorts of business in
the name of the mayor's office.
Tell me the truth, asshole.
Licenciado, it's time to go.
Easy, Sharkey.
Calm down, we have time.
I want to hear what
Vargas has to say. Well?
Let's see, licenciado,
where do I begin?
When I came to San Pedro...
I was determined to fulfill
the pledges and the orders...
of our president about
modernity and social justice.
But I felt really bad,
everything was fucked up.
They don't speak Spanish.
So Mr. Pek here had
to translate for me.
There was this priest
and a woman...
involved in businesses
wich didn't pay taxes.
And that is how I realized
the laws didn't work out...
and I changed them.
I can't believe it, Vargas.
You really changed
the Constitution?
You're such a smart guy.
"If the will of
the people demands it..."
the term on the office
may last up to twenty years...
with up to four
possibilities of reelection...
You son of a bitch.
Not even Porfirio Diaz
could have pulled this one off.
And I thought, you couldn't
get something out of this town.
So, how much is there left?
All Of it!
That's almost all, licenciado.
From what you said you
made a hundred times more.
Don't fuck with me, asshole!
Where is it?
Is not here, licenciado.
It's in the bank
of San Pedro, right?
- Where the hell is it?
- It's inside... in the house.
Go and get it! Hurry, Sharkey,
those assholes are after us.
Gloria!
Gloria!
Gloria!
Honey?
"Darling, I went to
the States with Bobby".
"See you in..."
in the hell...
That fucking whore!
What's the matter, Vargas?
She's a whore, right?
Well, Pek. You found something?
Licenciado.
Keep looking, asshole.
I don't know where he hid it.
Well, Vargas?
- What have you got for me?
- They took it all.
Do you take me for an asshole?
It's true, licenciado.
They took it all, left me
without a cent. Look.
What's all this?
I had a fortune.
But a fucking gringo
and my slut wife...
left me without a cent.
Look, you...
Be careful, Vargas.
Be careful.
We're being followed
and they'll be here soon.
Sharkey!
- There's no more Sharkey.
- Careful, Vargas.
You better put that away,
you could...
Fucking Vargas,
you shot me, asshole!
Sorry, licenciado.
But it is either you or me.
I was doing fine till you
said that I was the law.
The only authority. Herod's Law.
By your holy wife that...
Go on, mock me, asshole!
Mock me!
It's Herod's Law.
It's all bullshit.
Women...
are all whores.
And cows...
are all mad.
The gringos...
are sons of bitches.
Who want everything.
You and your advice,
look at your advice!
This country has no solution.
No solution, licenciado.
Does it? Does it? Answer me,
asshole! Answer me!
Fucking moaning Indians,
you'll see now!
Out of the way!
What's going on!
Fucking Indians!
Delinquents!
This village is mine!
Transgressors of the law
and institutions!
Everything I do
is for your sake!
You're poor because you want
to be poor, assholes!
Friends!
Juan Vargas.
Fellow citizens!
It wasn't me! It wasn't me!
Juan Vargas.
It wasn't me, it wasn't me!
I'm sorry!
Forgive me, friends!
I did it all for your own good!
No, no, no!
No!
I didn't do anything
I didn't do anything.
Over here!
He") me!
He") me!
Where's Lopez?
I didn't kill him!
Help me! Help me!
Excuse me, how far is it to
San Pedro DE los Saguaros?
Good afternoon.
Do you speak Spanish?
We're lost.
Do you know how far is it to
San Pedro DE los Saguaros?
This is it.
So, you must be the new mayor.
I've been waiting
since yesterday.
I'm Carlos Pek, your secretary.
Pleased to meet you, Jesus Canales.
President Aleman and governor
Terrazas have sent me to...
bring her modernity...
and social justice.
It's here.
Welcome, madam.
Here?
Hey, Pek, I have a question.
What happened to the last mayor?
Well, you know,
they say so many things.
Oh, licenciado, if I tell you...
And so ends the fourth report
of president Miguel Aleman...
reaffirming that the unity and
solidarity of the Mexicans...
will triumph
over any challenge...
peace and social justice
are guaranteed.
That the recent agreements
are just another obstacle...
Hey, we've got problems
with China's truck.
Call me licenciado, asshole.
I'll be there as soon
as I finish this.
Honorable Congress of the Union.
It is an honor to be here
at this seat of democracy...
representing my home state.
Today, more than never,
we congress men...
must fulfill the
expectations of our nation.
We must be alert and
fight without quarter...
against the Revolution's
enemies. Yes, just as I did...
I thwarted the conspiracy
of licenciado Lopez...
the ambitious
governor's secretary...
along with evil people,
to murder that wonderful man...
the recently elected
governor Terrazas.
Friends...
I am not ashamed to admit it.
I have to come to this Congress
with bloodstained hands.
I don't deny it.
To ask for pardon
would be hypocritical.
But this is not the blood
of a stranger or a brother.
It is the blood of an enemy,
an enemy of the men...
who defend the ideals
of the Revolution!
We have overcome another
obstacle; Many more remain...
'cause our party's challenge,
for the good of the nation...
is to remain in power
forever and ever!
Thank you, my fellow countrymen!
