Ah!
- There you are, Tod.
- Shh!
I found one.
No way!
Look at the size of that thing.
- Sure is ugly.
- It's a monster!
I can smell its evil breath from here.
No, uh, that's me.
I had socks for lunch.
Ugh!
Uh, how about you take this one?
- Come on. We're a team, right?
- Wanna shake on it?
Shake on it.
- Ready... set...
- Go!
Come on, Copper!
Whoa!
Come on, keep up!
Wait for me!
Huh?
Whoa!
We got him now!
Ha-ha-ha! We chasing crickets,
or are we just hanging out?
I messed up again.
- I can't do nothing right.
- Hey, that's not true.
You're... you're...
You're housetrained, ain't ya?
Oh, Copper.
Race ya!
Wow! The trucks for the fair.
I've never seen so much stuff in my life.
Oh, boy! I can't wait.
- Are you goin'?
- I'm-a goin'.
- You goin'?
- I'm-a goin'.
Chief says you
can win a ribbon there.
- Really? For what?
- Just for being a good dog.
Whoa!
That's a pretty good pumpkin.
That one's even bigger.
And noisier.
Hey, Tod, do you hear that?
Whoa! Oh!
Oh!
- You OK?
- Tripped over my own ears.
See? I told ya.
I'm just a bad dog.
Ah, don't be like that.
- Copper!
- Uh-oh. Time for my hunting lesson.
Hey, maybe I'll be good at hunting.
Yeah! I'm gonna be
the huntingest puppy ever.
Now you're talkin'.
Let's see now.
Copper!
Copper! Oh, where did
that pup gone off to?
Mm. Hmph!
Hi, Chief.
Ready for my lesson.
Oh, darn my hide.
Playing nursemaid to a pup
when I should be a-practicin'
for the contest.
Aw, you don't need to practice.
You're the best hunting dog
in the whole county.
Well, I reckon it's true.
I mean, they don't give
those fourth-place prizes
to just anybody.
Oh, there you are, Copper.
We'll make a hunting dog out of you yet.
Here, here. Snuff this up.
Now, when this rabbit takes off,
you follow his scent.
Then when you have him, let loose with
a big ol' hound-dog howl!
I must be going deaf.
I said howl!
You're gonna lose your head
one of these days, Amos Slade.
<i>It's my head, woman!</i>
Good boy. Heh-heh.
OK, Chief. Get goin'!
- What are you waiting for? Go get him!
- Go, Copper!
Attaboy, Copper!
Ahh! Pup's as useful
as a milk bucket under a bull.
Tod!
Oh, I'm getting all turned around.
I don't know what I'm doing.
It's easy.
You just sniff him out.
When you smell him,
lift up your head and howl.
Like this?
No, not me!
- Uh-oh.
- Gotta go!
Ow! Ding-dang it all!
Ha! I've got ya now.
Come back here, you little varmint!
Excuse me. Coming through.
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
- My milk!
- Oh, no!
Abigail, wait!
Amos Slade!
I've gotcha now!
Uh-oh.
Amos Slade, I told you to keep
your beast away from my Tod!
That mangy hound of yours
just cost me a bucket of milk!
Your fox was after my chickens, Tweed!
What do I care about your milk?
Well, as long as you're wasting my milk,
you may as well have some pie
to go along with it.
What the dickens are you...
Bad dog, Copper!
You are a very bad dog!
Well, you can just forget
about the fair, Copper.
Oh, dagnabit.
You couldn't find a rabbit
at a petting zoo on Easter Sunday.
There. That oughta keep
you out of trouble.
Let's go, Chief.
Fair's a-waitin'.
Aw, you'll get it one day, boy.
You just gotta grow up a little, is all.
He got you over a barrel, huh?
Well, say something.
There's nothing to say.
It's just what I'm good for - nothing.
You're real good at getting into trouble.
'Course you're good at
something, Copper.
We just gotta figure out what.
You know what you need?
A little fun.
I wonder if there's
a county fair around here.
Come to think of it, there is!
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm a little tied up right now.
Nothing a fox can't fix.
Whoo-hoo!
- What do you wanna do first?
- Everything.
Mom! Fireworks, fireworks!
Balloons! Ice cream!
Come on!
- Fireworks.
- Oh, yeah.
- We've gotta see 'em.
- Smack at sundown.
Shake on it!
There's that sound again.
Sounds pretty good.
Sounds like somebody got
their tail stuck in a door.
Voice like an angel...
with looks to match.
Oh, please.
- Aah!
- Oh!
Oh, my poor...
Darn this one-horse,
two-bit, free-timing fair!
Now, Dixie, it ain't like it smacked your
singing. Can we get back to rehearsing?
I refuse to work under these conditions.
- Uh-oh. Here we go.
- Well, I'll tell you what, Dixie.
You rehearse, and afterwards I'll give
that piece of wood a good old talking-to.
- I got two bones on Dixie.
- I'll cover that.
It just so happens I am a professional,
and my standards...
Oh, now, Dixie, darling,
you put on that same old record every day.
Ain't it just about wore out by now?
You have some nerve talking
to me that way.
If your ear were any more tin,
they could can beans with it.
Well, you listen to me, Miss Fancy Tail.
In a couple of days, we will be
in front of that talent scout
from the Grand Old Opry.
I get possibly maimed for life, and all you
can talk about is the Grand Old Opry?
- Now, Dixie...
- I'll be in my trailer.
Darling, we got a show to do.
You can't just walk...
...away.
Sometimes I dislike that woman.
If they disliked each other any more,
they'd have to get hitched.
- We're o...
- Ooh!
Sorry, fellas.
Oh, I can tell right now, this is gonna be
the worst show of all time!
It's gonna be the worst!
OK, let's have fun out there!
- Cash, who will sing Dixie's part?
- Just give me a second.
- I do a pretty good Dixie.
- Waylon, I don't picture you doing Di...
Sit!
OK. Here's the good news.
Granny Rose, you are
singing Dixie's part.
- Me?
- Oh, she's gonna love this one.
We have a real treat for you now.
Lyle Snotgrass and The Singin' Strays.
You could almost swear
them dogs are really singing.
Come on, kid. Sing with us.
What?
Yeah!
- Oh, yeah.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
Hot dog! Listen to 'em, Cash.
They love that number.
Yeah, and if a cow had wheels,
it'd be a milk truck.
That song is hokey.
They're clapping for this little puppy.
Well, the kid's cute, all right.
Ha-ha-ha!
Kid, I'll tell you what.
You can sing!
You got pipes of gold.
You sure do!
- Hey, kid, what's your name?
- Copper.
Copper, thanks for getting us
out of a tight spot.
- It was fun!
- You got a future in show business, kid.
You come back and see us
in a couple of years, you hear?
- Yep, in a couple of years.
- 'Cause being in a band takes maturity.
What?
What?
- What just happened?
- I'll tell you what happened.
You're good at something,
and I mean good!
Whoo-hoo!
- Just what do you think you're doing?
- A little audience participation.
- That kid wowed 'em.
- Kid? What kid?
- Bye, Mr. Cash.
- That kid.
- Little critter was heaven-sent.
- That sang my lead?
Oh, no.
He didn't just sing it.
<i>He sang it.</i>
You don't mean to tell me
that wet-behind-the-ears puppy
could ever take my place in a band.
I didn't say that. Although he does have
that refreshing, blooming youth about him.
- Just what exactly are you saying?
- What do you think I'm saying?
- You're saying what I think you're saying.
- I think you know what I think I'm saying.
You'd better know that what you're saying
isn't what I think you're saying.
Why do you always...
- Only 'cause you never...
- What if I said to you...
Ooh! You know, this is just
like the time when you...
You better not bring that up.
Hmph! Well, I think we've both
been perfectly clear.
Ohh, perfectly.
- I quit!
- Huh?
- Cash, what are we gonna do?
- She's gone with the wind.
Sit!
I'll take care of this. I'd better.
That talent scout will be here any minute.
- Hi, there.
- Well, who are you?
Olivia Farmer, designated chaperone
to Winchell P. Bickerstaff,
talent scout
from the Grand Old Opry. That's you.
Ahem. Chaperone, huh?
I'm working to get
my community service merit badge.
Well, that's quite admirable,
little lady.
Then I'll have more
than Sally Ann Merrybaum.
Thinks she's so great.
Well, lead on, Miss Farmer.
I'm a-lookin' for some talent.
Oh, Dixie, you ain't mad
over a little joshing, are ya?
I was only teasing you.
You know how I feel about you.
Yeah, you have a lousy way
of showing it.
I am trying to kiss
and make up here.
Now, won't you please
accept my apology?
Blow it out your ear.
All right, you diva dog,
but I'm in charge of this band,
and ain't no one's indispensable.
You're in charge?
- Which one of us is in the driver's seat?
- Now, listen, you...
Now you got me riled.
All right!
Yee-haw!
Ride 'em, cowboy, away!
Whoo-hoo!
Yee-haw!
All right!
This is the most fun ever!
- Second-most fun ever.
- Mr. Cash.
Kid, I saw how blissful
you looked singing.
That had to be
the best time you ever had.
Oh, for sure.
Well, now, we can't let nothing
in the way of that.
Like I was saying,
how'd you like to join the band?
- Really? Huh?
- Yes, sir.
Genuine Singin' Stray.
What do you say?
Yeah!
Copper, we were gonna
have some more fun.
Well, Tod can be
in the band, too, right?
- Well, uh...
- He's my best friend.
Can you sing, kid?
- Uh...
- 'Course he can sing. Show him, Tod.
Whoa!
Hoo-hoo!
Here's the good news:
You're gonna be part
of the entourage-y.
- What's that?
- That's French.
Means you get to hang out with
our star here, keep him happy.
He does that already.
You know, fetch water, clean dog bowls -
fun stuff like that.
- That's fun?
- Does Granny have fleas?
Aw, come on, Todd.
It's gonna be great!
Well... OK.
All right, then.
Let's get moving.
Wasn't he amazing, the way
he ate fire, Mr. Bickerstaff?
Maybe you shouldn't
have stood so close.
Now you tell me.
- OK.
- Hey, Dixie.
- You come crawling back.
- Oh, by the way, you can't quit.
- You're fired.
- Oh! What? You can't fire me!
I already quit!
Cash, you... Oh!
Now you've got me riled.
Ohh!
Ah, don't get your collar
in a bunch, Dixie. Pitch a fur ball.
The nerve of that Cash!
Where's he get off firing me?
Oh, I thought you quit.
I'm that man's heart and soul!
It's plain as a pig on a sofa.
That Cash can talk a dog off a meat truck.
He talked me into getting sweet on him,
and now he tosses me away
like yesterday's cornbread!
Honey, I don't blame you
for feeling hurt.
Hurt? What do you mean by that?
You think Cash could hurt me?
Mangy mutt.
Oh, you'll howl real good
today, fellas.
Oh, well, there's more
than one way to skin a cat.
- Ahem.
- No offense.
Soup's on!
That's a good boy right there!
All right, fellas, all right.
Calling out the team.
You know, if I could just play the banjo
better, y'all would be eating steaks.
Hey! I guess I'd better go practice.
Welcome to the band, kid.
Let me do some introductions.
That there is Waylon and Floyd.
They're the, uh, brains of the outfit.
Oh, why I put up with this
low-class crew of mutts is beyond me.
Uh, and that delicate flower
is Granny Rose.
Textbook version of growing old gracefully.
I got me an itch.
Yep. You'll never harmonize
with a finer group of singing strays and...
Uh, you are a stray, right, boy?
- Uh...
- 'Course he's a stray.
You don't see a collar
around him, do ya?
- Well, that's true.
- I don't see one.
No collar, no home.
Whoo! Good.
Only strays allowed in this dog band.
- Tod, I'm not a stray.
- Shh!
It'll be our secret.
Ha-ha. Just wait till Copper sees this.
Another fourth-place ribbon.
Ha-ha.
Next year, we're going for the three-peat.
- Oh!
- What the...
- Widow Tweed.
- Hmm?
Oh! Do you make a career
out of getting in my way?
Step aside, woman.
I got a prize-winner coming through.
- Well, so do I.
- What?
This here's a hunting dog.
What could you do with a pie?
Uh... Oh, yeah. Oh.
Woman's got spunk.
I'll give her that. Hmph!
OK, fellas, ten minutes till curtain.
Let's round 'em up and move 'em out.
Move 'em, round 'em.
I'm movin'.
- That means you, Copper.
- Huh?
Whoa!
- Good luck, Copper.
- Thanks, entourage-y.
Say, Tod, while we're on, why don't you
spiff up those bowls a little bit?
The bowls? OK, Cash.
Don't forget - fireworks.
Smack at sundown.
It's a promise.
Psst! Little darling.
Come on in.
Dixie wants to talk to ya.
- But I'm supposed to sing now.
- Oh, I know, I know.
I just wanted to pass along
my secret of success.
Really? Thanks, Miss Dixie.
Before every show,
take a big ol' helping of that.
Peanut butter?
All right, let's get
to growling and howling.
Now... Granny Rose,
go fetch Copper, will you?
Ah, uh... Hang on.
Ooh, ah. Oh, that's good.
Uh-oh. Bad news in a rhinestone collar.
Oh, why, Cash, you look as
nervous as a long-tailed cat
in a room full of rocking chairs.
'Cause I'm busy as a farmer with
one hoe and two rattlesnakes.
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm as... as...
Oh, I got nothing.
- What is it, Dixie?
- Oh...
I just thought you could
use a lead singer.
Peanut butter?
But, Copper, you have to sing!
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Oh, hold on, Copper.
I'll be right back.
The winner of the milking
contest is the Widow Tweed
and her fine cow Abigail!
Ohh!
What?
Copper! Come on out!
Perfect! Just like that!
All right!
- Moo!
- Ha-ha-ha!
- You know darn well that Copper is...
- Copper? You mean that little pup?
Why, he ran off
with that fox friend of his
like a bank robber on roller skates.
- You're kidding.
- Hey, if I'm lying,
may my fur lose its natural luster.
That did it! I can sing!
Great. When you get out
there, don't forget to...
O-O-OK.
See you at the fireworks, right?
Get used to it... entourage.
- This is how it's gonna be from now on.
- What do you mean?
While he's off having fun and getting
the glory, he'll stick you with the chores.
No, Copper isn't like that.
Yeah.
Well, we'll see, won't we?
Here I am!
Ohh!
Huh. Ran off, huh?
Sorry, Dix.
Peanut butter?
Oh, Dixie.
You are through.
Well, getting rid of me
ain't gonna be so easy, Cash.
Whoa!
That looked easy.
Remind me to give that piece
of wood a bonus.
Look, Miss Farmer, this ain't the kind of
talent I'm a-looking for.
Yeah, you're right.
That flea circus was totally amateur hour.
Waylon, give me a back beat.
We are headed for the big time,
and I got a big-time song to take us there.
Follow my lead, kid.
Oh, he's just so darn cute.
Oh, Cash, I'm supposed
to meet Tod soon for the...
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
We can't let nobody hold us back.
We're hound dudes, remember?
Wow. Awesome.
I've never been so high up in my life.
I think I was higher
than the fireworks.
Yeah, and how about
those free hot dogs?
You looked happier than a hog
at Sunday potluck.
All right.
Meet you backstage, kid.
- We got a lot of work to do.
- You got it, Cash.
- Oh, sorry, Tod.
- Hey, Copper, how's the Ferris wheel?
The fireworks!
Oh, gosh, I forgot.
Cash and I were busier
than two mice in a cheese shop.
- Too busy for your best friend?
- It's not like that, Tod.
Cash said I had
to let everyone see me.
Cash said it's good
for the band. Cash said...
"Cash said, Cash said."
Who cares about Cash?
Tod, what's wrong? Are you jealous?
'Course not, you dumb dog.
- Then what's eating you?
- I don't know.
It's like, you're not around anymore.
Well, I'm around now. Let's do something.
I mean, if you wanna.
Now?
- Shake on it?
- Shake on it.
Kid, I swear you're slow as an iron toad.
Come on, you're holding us up. Let's go.
Waylon, would you get up? We got more
ground to cover than the Pony Express.
Now, let's get to work, hounds!
- I guess I gotta go.
- But... but, Copper...
I'll see you later, OK?
Yeah? Well, maybe you will
and maybe you won't!
Why eat 'em, Dix? Might as well
just slap 'em right on your hips.
Come on, Zelda. I need a drink.
Give me one straight.
Give me that.
Oh, darling. You look like
something the cat dragged in.
- Ahem.
- Oh, no offense.
- What do you care?
- Oh, come on, Tod.
We're both
in the same old briar patch now.
Cast off by the one we care about the most.
Guess you know how that feels now.
- Copper's forgotten all about me.
- Yeah.
- I heard that. Hurts worse than anything.
- Yeah.
I remember this one tom cat
named Leroy...
I'm talking to the fox.
You see, Tod, relationships
and show business, they just don't mix.
Oh, it starts out nice and friendly.
Then they get that first taste of fame,
and it's "look out for number one."
All right, let's get to crooning.
Cold noses.
Not even a little-bitty bone.
Now, that's a good little doggie.
And you know what?
He wouldn't even be in that dumb old band
if I hadn't lied for him.
- Come again?
- I got Cash to think he was a stray.
Copper's no stray.
He lives just down the road apiece.
Well, darling, all our troubles are over.
How'd you like
to get your best friend back?
- But how?
- Heh-heh-heh.
Just listen close to old Dixie here.
Whoa, whoa. That last note was flatter
than a duck's footprint.
Take it from the top, please.
Oh, but, Cash, we've been at it all night.
And we'll be at it all day
if that's what it takes.
This ain't just another show.
The scout from the Grand Old Opry
is gonna be watching.
Take it from the top.
Copper. Just what are you doing?
Well, it's a cricket. Me and Tod used to...
What is the matter with you, kid?
Don't you wanna be a star?
- Well... sure.
- Well, then, why don't you...
Cash. He's just a pup.
Copper's just having a little fun.
You do remember fun, don't you?
OK. All right.
Just take five, everyone.
Sweetie pie, don't take it to heart.
Cash's bark is worse than his bite.
And if he growls at us again,
I'm gonna muzzle him myself.
Tod?
Tod.
You in there?
Cash, you have seen Tod?
Nope. Dixie ain't around neither.
You were looking for her?
No.
Well...
I remember when I first met her.
I was just a little old stray like you,
all paws and ears,
and felt like a real good-for-nothing.
- You?
- Yeah.
And then one night, we went a-howling
at the moon, and I found out we could sing.
I said, "Dixie, this is our ticket to success.
We are gonna be stars."
I guess I'd be stretching it
if I said I didn't want her around sometimes.
But we're a couple of hound dudes now,
remember?
We can't let old friends get
in the way of that, right?
- I guess not.
- Oh, come on. You're having fun, ain't ya?
Ha! Are you kidding?
Well, you just wait till we're on top.
We are so close, I can smell it.
The Grand Old Opry.
All we gotta do is ace that audition.
- Right?
- Heh-heh-heh. Right.
- Come on. Let's go rehearse some more.
- Attaboy.
Copper!
Copper!
Oh, where could that pup
have gotten off to?
Copper!
Tod! Oh, Tod!
Widow, what are you doing up
this time of night?
Oh, I can't find my Tod anywhere.
That pup of yours probably chased him off.
I wouldn't know. I can't find him.
Oh...
Well, if I see a sign of your puppy,
I'll give you a holler.
I'm obliged. If I see hide or hair
of that fox of yours, well...
Thank you, Amos.
Tod!
Tod!
Oh, Tod.
Copper!
Tod!
Oh, my hair.
Hmph!
Ugh.
Broke a nail...
- That's where Copper lives.
- Nice spread. Could use woman's touch.
You sure this is a good idea?
It's the only way. When Clem Clod-kicker
over there gets to the fair and sees Copper,
he'll bring him home for sure.
You two will get to be friends again,
and I will reclaim my rightful place
in the spotlight.
Hmm. We just gotta figure out
how to get them to follow us.
Heh-heh.
That's the easy part.
See, old Chief there hates me,
but he couldn't catch a cold in winter,
and wherever Chief goes, Slade follows.
Well, let's see your stuff there, cowboy.
Psst! Chief!
Chief!
Oh, that tickles.
Huh?
Wha...
- Oh!
- Ooh, ooh.
Snuggly-wuggly little pookie-pooh.
Yow!
Chief, what the devil...
- Tod!
- Eh!
It's that darn critter of yours!
My critter? It's your hunt...
Oh, my! Oh, dear!
When I get my hands on you...
Tod, I'm coming!
I gotcha in my sight!
You can't get away from me!
I'm a fourth-place winner two times over.
Why, you! Come back here!
Ah, Chief, come back!
Testing. Testing.
Why, Cash, look at you.
You're nervous as a flea on dip day.
- I haven't seen you like this in a long time.
- You ain't never seen me like this, Granny.
I just hope that talent scout fella's
in a good mood.
You know, that snake charmer could use
a little more practice. Don't you think?
Aah!
Oh! Hey! Hey! Aah!
Get the lead out of them boots,
Mr. Bickerstaff.
The talent show's just about to start.
Aah!
I know. I'm excited too.
Whoa, whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Ugh! Ugh!
- Mm! Blueberries.
- Oink!
Aah!
Aah!
Here we are, Mr. Bickerstaff.
Just in time.
Ladies and gentlemen, The Singin' Strays!
Coming through! Excuse me! Pardon me!
- Tod?
- Copper?
- Chief!
- Tod!
Copper! That's my dog!
You ain't a stray?
Aah!
Aah!
What in tarnation?
Dixie, what have you done?
Where they going? Wait. We can't let'em
leave. We got a show to do. Wait!
That's it! I can't take anymore.
I don't book no circuses!
Why, thank you, little lady.
- You've been so kind.
- Drive careful.
Bye, Mr. Bickerstaff. See ya next year!
Ohh!
What are we gonna do now, Cash?
You're gonna go home.
- But the band...
- Don't you get it?
You're fired!
You know what? You used to be
a lot more fun to be around.
Oh, now, come on. Where are you going?
Hey!
Oh, yeah? Fine! We don't need you, either.
Right, boys?
- Sorry, Cash.
- It just ain't no fun anymore.
Why does it always rain
when things go wrong?
I don't know, Floyd.
Happy now?
Copper, I'm sorry. I just wanted to...
You ruined everything!
Copper!
Attaboy.
Let's get outta here.
Oh, Tod. There, there, now.
Oh! Oh!
Copper?
Dixie?
What are you doing here?
I just thought you should know
that blowing your cover was my idea.
Not Tod's.
I guess I just lost sight
of what's really important.
And, darling, I'm awful sorry.
He never wanted to hurt you.
He just wanted you to be his friend again.
Well, that's what I came to say.
Copper?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Are we still friends?
- I don't know. Aren't you all mad?
Well, I've been thinking,
I've been kind of a cabbage head.
If that ain't right, grits ain't groceries.
Well, anyway, I sure am sorry.
Yeah, and I'm sorry too.
Hey! I just got a great idea. Hang on.
Got something for you.
Thanks, but I didn't get you anything.
No, no. It belongs to the talent scout.
I figure you could use it to find him.
You know, if you still want that audition.
- How?
- You're a real hunting dog, aren't you?
And this here hat is his address.
Yeah, that's it. Get a good whiff.
OK, you get the scout,
and I'll go get the band.
Lyle, you fool. There's your problem.
The doohickey is coming out
of the whatchamacallit
and leaking all over the hoozanozzle.
Cash! Cash!
- Dixie's in trouble!
- What's happened?
What's wrong?
Sit!
- Where is she?
- Follow me.
All right, that'll do it.
All right, fellas. We are off to...
Uh...
fellas?
Waylon? Cash?
Anybody?
Huh?
Doh!
Huh? Huh?
- Well, where is she?
- Uh...
Um...
Huh?
Thataway!
Come on, everyone! Follow me!
Copper, where's Dixie?
She'll be along.
Cash!
Way to go, Copper!
- Cash, are you all right?
- No, no, are you all right? I'm...
I'm fine.
What in tarnation...
I thought you were in trouble.
Just exactly why did you get us
all together?
'Cause... 'cause...
'Cause that's how it oughta be.
Like the words in the song.
Like the sun and blue skies. Um...
Like summer nights. And fireflies.
- Like an itch.
- And a scratch.
Well, ain't somebody gonna sing?
Gosh, I missed you.
Ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Whoo-hoo!
Well, bravo! I finally found my act!
Yahoo!
You all gonna be stars!
Whoo-whoo!
There you fellas are!
- Are these here talented canines yours?
- Yes, yes, sir.
We've got to talk.
Come over here, son.
Well, there you go, Cash.
You just got what you always wanted.
Well, maybe I had it all along.
- Well, what are you saying?
- Well, what do you think I'm saying?
Well, you'd better be saying
what I think you're saying.
I think you know what I'm saying is
what you think I'm saying.
Well, I thought you'd never ask.
Now, there's the good news.
Somebody smack me.
I must be dreaming.
We got a little old barn called the Grand
Old Opry I'd kinda like to show you.
Yes, yes, sir. That sounds great.
That would be fantastic.
Tod!
- Tod!
- Huh?
Tod!
Copper?
But the band... Aren't you doing with them?
Can't.
You and me... we got crickets to chase.
And if I ever forget that again,
you just kick me in my walkin'-awayin'.
- Shake on it?
- Shake on it.
Hey!
Aah!
Huh?
- Oh!
- Wait for me!
