Sunday, the FBI successfully concluded...
...an investigation to end
a very serious breach...
...in the security of the United States.
The arrest of Robert Hanssen
for espionage...
...should remind us all,
every American should know...
...that our nation, our free society...
...is an international target
in a dangerous world.
I shouldn't tease you.
That just gets me into trouble.
I got him!
- Him and the wife.
- Okay.
She can be turned.
They were screaming at each other.
We gotta tell the C-T, guys.
Did you catch any of
what they were saying?
Some of it.
I'm just gonna need a translator.
Okay.
I can still work the corner outside
their apartment. They didn't make me.
But we gotta get over there now,
while they're still fighting.
It's a protocol for storing
information on our targets.
Yeah, we got that part.
The thing that's unclear to us is...
...what it was doing
on Gene's desk.
It has to work its way up the chain,
doesn't it?
Nobody likes a show-off, Eric.
We're all trying to make agent,
you know.
Different color tabs,
five different fonts.
You must have spent a weekend
at Kinko's on this thing.
- Did you read it?
- No.
That's too bad. Because you're
both credited in here, by name.
- Really?
- Really?
Yeah, for your help
with the software.
Can we get over to
that apartment now?
- Are they terrorists?
- They're targets, honey.
- That's all I said, right?
- Right.
- Sorry.
- Good girl.
Mom and Dad want to take us
to Mass today.
- You want to go to Mass with them?
- I'd rather go to a movie.
Me, too.
- What?
- I should have been one alley over.
The light was better.
You're gonna be an agent.
Are the rest of those guys
working as hard as you?
- Of course.
- I bet they aren't.
Say it again, okay?
- Say what again?
- That I'm gonna be an agent.
You're gonna be an agent.
Don't get it.
You've reached the O'Neills,
please leave a message.
Get dressed.
You've been TDY'd.
- To where?
- They'll explain at the field office.
- We're due in twenty minutes.
- On a Sunday?
I'll get right to it,
if you don't mind.
You're being tasked
to Headquarters...
...where you'll be riding the desk
of an agent named Robert Hanssen.
- Do you know him?
- No.
Former head of our
Soviet Analytical Unit...
...considered our most knowledgeable
analyst on Russian Intel.
Last six years he's been our liaison
at the State Department.
- It's Sunday.
- We're bringing him back...
...to Headquarters
where he's gonna start...
...our new Information Assurance
Division, safeguarding...
...the Bureau's IT system from
cyber terrorism and infiltration.
Wait. I've heard of this guy.
Was he the one who hacked
into another agent's hard drive?
He's the best computer guy we've got.
He's also a sexual deviant.
Been posting on the Internet.
Lurid material.
There's some complaints in his file
from female subordinates.
I shouldn't tease you.
That just gets me into trouble.
You're gonna keep
an eye on him for us.
- It's not a glamour detail, sorry.
- Do you have a FISA warrant?
- Of course.
- Do I get a cover?
No, Hanssen would peel it away
in a day.
He spent the last twenty years
outthinking Russian spies.
And jerking off under his desk.
You want to duck down there
and scrape for samples, feel free.
Just so you know, no one
around here feels good about...
...embarrassing a guy who's done
twenty-five years of service.
But we have reason to believe
that there are other agents...
...that might be involved in this as well.
Shared postings et cetera.
If that's true it could mean a huge
embarrassment to the Bureau.
A few rules.
First...
...no one can know about this,
not even your wife.
You have a new boss.
- His name is Hanssen...
- His name is Hanssen...
- ...works in Information Insurance.
- ...works in Information Insurance.
That's it.
- I understand.
- Second...
...you'll be serving at the needs
of the Bureau...
answerable to me at all times.
I hope that's clear.
This pager will be on your person
twenty-four seven.
If it's me you'll see
a seven and a pound sign.
You'll keep a journal of everything
that goes on in that office.
Who he talks to, who he calls.
No detail's insignificant.
Got it?
Good.
Gene can fill you in on the rest.
Thanks for coming in.
- Agent Burroughs.
- Yes?
Is this high priority?
We've been ghosting priority
targets lately. C-T targets.
If I'm being pulled
of that I just want to...
In other words, you want to know
if this is going to fast track...
...you into becoming an agent?
Gene tells me you're confident,
bordering on cocky.
He also says you can park it
when necessary.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Enjoy your Sunday.
This is the code for the combo lock.
And the code for the key punch.
And this is the badge
for the security pad.
You're all set.
- Sir, do you know Agent Hanssen?
- A little.
Is there anything you
can tell me about him?
- What would you like to know?
- Anything that would help me...
do my job better, I guess.
Sure.
Take nothing personally.
Good morning.
Tell me five things about yourself.
Four of them true.
I'm sorry?
It's a game we used to play
at the Soviet Analytical Unit.
To keep ourselves sharp.
It's lie detection.
I don't think I'd be much good
at bluffing.
And that would have counted
as your lie, right there.
Let me see this.
I'm gonna be reinventing how
the Bureau stores case information.
- Didn't anybody tell you that?
- They did.
Antiquated machine.
There are pallets of new computers
in every corridor of this building.
Why don't you go get one?
- I'll just fill out a req form.
- You're not listening. Just go get one.
Those req forms are for bureaucrats.
Actually get two.
That dinosaur on my desk
is useless to me.
- Agent Hanssen, my name is Eric.
- No, your name is "clerk".
And my name is "sir" or "boss",
if you can manage.
- Yes, sir.
- And if I ever catch you...
...in my office again, you're gonna
be pissing purple for a week.
You must know somebody.
I ordered ours a month ago.
Sir?
Sir, you could fall.
I won't fall.
I'm very coordinated.
Trying to re-route a phone line
to get Internet access.
I can get an IT guy in here
to do that for you, sir.
My Lord, you are as dumb as
a bag of hammers, aren't you?
Yes, let's bring in an IT guy...
...making thirty-five
thousand dollars a year...
...and give him access
to hard drives...
...that a foreign agent
would pay millions for.
We're supposed to be protecting...
...the Bureau from electronic infiltration.
What kind of sites do you like?
On the Internet.
Are there sites...
- Why?
- I've never seen anyone...
...stand on top of their desk
to get on line before.
Do you pray the Rosary every day?
Your file says you prepped
at Gonzaga. With the Jesuits.
- That's right. I did.
- So...
...do you pray the Rosary every day?
- Not every day, no.
- You should.
You still want my list, sir?
The five things?
These are the greatest
pens in the world.
I would never write
with anything else.
Sure.
I won Boy Scout merit badges
in every category except Riflery.
I haven't been to confession
since High School.
There are several words
I constantly misspell.
My favorite drink is a Vodka Tonic.
And I'm the only male
in the last four generations...
...of my family who
hasn't served in the military.
What is your drink then? Gin?
- Scotch.
- It's against Bureau policy...
...for an Agent to consume alcohol,
even off-duty.
- Did you know that?
- Yes, I did.
Because an FBI Agent
is never off-duty.
That comes from Director Freeh.
We attend the same church.
- Who's the pager for?
- My wife.
She likes to know she can get
hold of me twenty-four seven.
- She a Catholic girl?
- No.
Sort of a lapsed Protestant actually.
She's East German.
Big fan of Christmas plays, though.
Have to do something
about that, won't we?
- This is Eric.
- Is your wife within earshot?
Last I looked she hadn't been
read into the case.
- Can she hear this?
- No.
Good. Where are my pages?
I just started them.
He kept me there till ten o'clock.
Agent Burroughs, I don't know what I'm
supposed to be looking for with this guy.
It's not like he's gonna bring
a train of hookers through the office.
Just get me my pages.
Forgive us our trespasses now
and at the hour of our death.
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.
As it was in the beginning,
is now and ever shall be.
Amen.
Bonnie Wauck.
Bobby Hanssen!
He doesn't think too much of me.
- No?
- No.
There are a couple people
like that. At work.
They think I'm a...
lightweight, I guess.
They don't know you.
Maybe they do.
Great!
Good morning.
This is a very good work.
Sir, how did you get a copy of my...
- It was ignored, I'm sure.
- Yes, it was.
That's because you don't shoot.
The FBI is a gun culture.
You can't advance here
unless you're part of it.
Every Director in the history
of the Bureau...
...has come from the
Law Enforcement side.
Guys who shoot,
guys who make arrests.
There's never been a Director
from the Intel side.
Never will be.
Intel's Siberia.
- Sir.
- The "rubber gun" squad.
So why'd you stay?
All those years,
why didn't you transfer...
...into something with a higher profile?
Because I never cared
about making headlines.
- I wanted to make history.
- Sorry.
The people Intel tracks
are the ones...
...who want to wipe America off the map.
Somehow that always meant a little
more to me than being promoted.
Why are you reading
about Parkinson's?
My mother.
For a few years now.
I'm very sorry
to hear about that.
Good morning.
Morning.
I forgot to mention, sir,
we got a call from Photo...
...about a portrait sitting.
You're going up...
...on the "Twenty-Five
Years of Service" wall.
Imagine that.
Excuse me.
Lord!
- Beautiful woman.
- You're married.
I can look, can't I?
God expects you to live
your faith, Eric. At all times.
Besides, I disapprove
of women in pantsuits.
- You do?
- Men wear pants.
The world doesn't need
any more Hillary Clintons.
I wrote a program last night
using nothing but...
...ones and zeros
just to see if I could do it.
Six-hundred twelve bits of encryption,
completely unbreakable.
But you get the office
with the window.
Okay, help us.
What do we do?
First, we drop ACS,
which is a relic.
It's not nearly enough band-width.
That's why you've got agents who
still keep sensitive information...
...in cardboard boxes.
You need to move to an ATM system
instead of the WAN.
An OC forty-eight.
With a data rate of
2.488 megabits.
Start with Linux A-B servers
which puts us into Red Hat.
IP routers throughout the building.
Dynamic IP addresses to hide the
system using the Invicta prototype.
Would it be easier
if I sent this in a memo?
- Yes, it would.
- Fine.
On your desk in the morning.
You're gonna set up
meetings for me...
...with the appropriate systems
managers at the CIA...
...DIA, NSA and the Intel agencies
of each armed service.
- Yes, sir.
- They're all ahead of us on IT.
- We have to study them.
- Would you mind if we...
...book those appointments
through me, Bob?
- What for?
- Just protocol.
Of course.
And then we switch offices, right?
- Sure.
- Perfect.
We're fighting crime with
nineteenth century technology...
...and he's worried about protocol.
Set up those meetings.
Leave it up to him,
they'll never happen.
That was turf protection
you were just watching in there.
Didn't you spot it?
Organizational arrogance.
No, we don't want to learn
anything from the CIA.
We want the CIA answering to us.
You know what's going on
behind that door?
No, sir.
Analysts, looking for a spy inside
the Intelligence community.
Highest clearance. But there
aren't any CIA officers in there.
You know why?
Because it's a CIA officer...
...we're trying to build
a case against.
Now, could the mole be someone
from the Bureau and not the CIA?
Of course. Are we actively
pursuing that possibility?
Of course not.
Because we're the Bureau,
and the Bureau knows all.
Cooperation is counter-operational.
That's the mentality.
Of course, the enemies of
this country aren't so picky.
They'll work with anyone
who shares their hatred of us.
The Bureau hasn't learned
that lesson yet.
He keeps some paintings in
a conference room on eight.
I want you to get
one of them for me.
- Sir?
- It's two men on a boat.
- I want it.
- Wait, you mean Agent Garces?
- These are his paintings.
- Stop thinking like a clerk.
They're sitting in storage.
It's two guys on a boat.
Okay, where was Hanssen
on March 7th, 1991?
The file has him making a drop
at Ellis at 6:30 PM.
He badged in at 8:27 AM.
Badged out at 12:45.
Badges back in at 13:45.
Badged back out again at 17:36.
Let's take a look at August 12th, 1993.
You know why the Soviet Empire collapsed?
- "Good morning"?
- I made a career studying them.
They were smarter than us.
More devious, more determined.
So, why did they fail?
Godlessness.
Atheism.
I'm on my way to Morning Mass.
You do remember
what Mass is, yes?
The Jesuits at Gonzaga taught
you that much, didn't they?
Sir, my grandfather
was a Deacon.
Well, congratulations.
Now it's time to join the Varsity.
I saw a woman from
Planned Parenthood...
...on television this morning.
It was a lesbian, naturally.
Defending gay marriage.
I almost ripped
the cable out of the wall.
Bet she was wearing pants, huh?
Will your children be Jesuit-taught,
as you were?
I don't know yet.
That conversation's still
a few years away.
- It shouldn't be.
- I'm a GS-eleven.
We need a second salary before
we can start having...
What's money compared
with the blessings of family?
Tell me.
My wife was the one...
Good to see you, Bob.
It was my wife who
first brought me here.
Bonnie.
I was a Lutheran when we met,
and not much of one.
She saved my life.
Come.
We attend Saint Catherine's
on Sundays.
It's a traditional Latin service.
Then a big family lunch after.
Do you think Juliana
might like that?
I don't know.
Maybe.
Then let's give it a try.
This weekend.
My Bonnie's been known
to work miracles.
- Shut that off.
- Sorry.
- Is that your wife?
- No one else even has this number.
Well, perhaps you
should give her a call.
- It might be important.
- No, it's okay.
It can wait.
You know, when I page you it
isn't to discuss what's on Oprah.
It means I need
to speak with you.
Did you pick me
because I was Catholic?
- I'm sorry?
- Did you think he would...
...trust me because I was Catholic?
Jesus, Eric.
We picked you because
of your facility with computers.
We thought it would impress him.
We also thought he might like
that fifty-page proposal...
...you've been pushing
all over the Bureau.
I understand he got
his hands on a copy, right?
- So?
- You got pages for me?
We're gonna be searching his car.
It'll involve you keeping him
out of the office for a few hours.
Agent Burroughs, I'm starting to think
I might not be the right guy for this job.
- Yeah?
- I'm used to Intel cases.
Terrorist cases.
Targets of value.
Nobody ever put me
on a perversion detail before.
Think we're being
too hard on him?
I think that's your bus.
Would you go to Church with me?
Lord, I am not worthy that
thou shouldst come under my roof.
But only say the word and
my soul shall be healed.
- "Dominus vobiscum".
- "Et cum spiritu tuo".
Of course.
Walking, please.
Walking.
Juliana, how did
you like the service?
It was lovely.
I'd never been to a mass where
people knelt the whole time.
Well, it's a gesture of devotion.
Taught all our children not
to be grocery-cart Catholics.
You know the kind of
churchgoer that takes...
...whatever's convenient and
leaves the rest on the shelf.
It's all expected.
Eric is so nice.
Where did you two meet?
We met in a bar, actually.
Would you like some cake,
sweetheart?
I love Sundays.
Going to Mass,
having the kids here.
Makes everything
else fade away.
- Sorry, I was snooping.
- Don't be.
I want you to feel at home here.
Is this your father, sir?
He must have been proud of you.
- FBI Top Soviet analyst.
- I don't know.
Father wasn't very impressed
by things.
He wanted me to be a doctor.
He rigged my first driving test
the day I turned sixteen.
Made an arrangement
with my DMV instructor.
- So you'd pass?
- So I would fail.
He thought it would
toughen me up.
I do that, too, I suppose.
Test people.
More than I ought to.
Shoot. I almost forgot.
I have something for you.
It's everything I could get
on Parkinson's.
Downloaded last night.
Made quite a bit of progress
in the last few years.
Didn't know if you were up on it.
Is there someone in your family
who has Parkinson's?
No. No, thank God.
You know, sir, I think
you're misunderstood.
By who?
By whoever gives out
window offices, for one.
That's all right.
I think I made too much fuss
of all that.
I'll be gone so soon anyway, what
good would a window do me now?
57 in two months,
that's mandatory retirement.
It's fine.
It's time.
I could stay there
another hundred years...
...and still just be an afterthought.
The perks go to the guys who play
the game, the ones who politic.
I knew a long time ago
I didn't have the stomach for that.
But I'll get my portrait on
that twenty-five year wall, right?
Now that's something.
Doesn't really matter much,
does it?
The judgments of other men.
I know what I've done.
What's the trouble?
I want to see what
you got on this guy.
- Come again.
- His "internet postings", his e-mails.
- Your case.
- Why?
Because I don't think
you have one.
I can read you in.
I'm authorized to do that.
But it would only
put you at greater risk.
Of what?
What the hell is all this?
The guy doesn't drink,
doesn't tell dirty jokes.
Goes to church every day, his wife
loves him, so do his grandkids.
And why the hell would you hand
a new division to a guy who's...
...retiring in two months,
especially if he's under investigation.
- You through?
- I think this whole thing is cooked.
I think he keeps shooting
his mouth off about the Bureau...
...and nobody knows
what to do with him...
...so we tag him as a deviant
and run him out of the building.
It's bullshit, the whole thing.
It's Kenneth Starr all over again except I'm
running around looking for the blue dress.
You've come to admire him, I see.
Yes.
- Respect him?
- Yes.
Well, that was inevitable.
For our purposes
it was sort of necessary.
He's a traitor, Eric.
He started spying for the Russians,
we think, in 1985.
He's given them military secrets,
intelligence secrets.
He gave them our Continuity
of Government Program...
...which told them where
the President would be taken...
...during a nuclear
or terrorist attack.
And the Vice President.
And the Congress. And the Cabinet.
The damage he's done to the
US Government is in the billions.
But that's just the money part.
He's also given up lives.
Sources we were working.
In one of his drops
he identified Valery Martynov...
...and Sergei Motorin,
two KGB agents we'd turned.
They were flown back
to Moscow and executed.
We don't have a handle yet on how
many of our assets he's compromised.
Maybe fifty, maybe more.
I shouldn't tease you.
That just gets me into trouble.
Our file on him came
from two Russian defectors.
The Bureau paid
seven million dollars for it.
Of course everything
in the file is inadmissible.
We make our own case
independently or he walks.
Not that it matters,
but the sexual stuff is also true.
Irrelevant but true.
The stories on the Internet,
they're about his wife.
Using her real name.
Sweet little anecdotes about...
...how much she loves rough sex,
that sort of thing.
He's a big fan of strippers, too.
Has been for years.
But his grandchildren do love him.
That part I can't argue.
There's no such thing as the
"Information Assurance Division".
No.
We created that
to lure him back from State.
Ninety-nine-thirty
was built for him, too.
Video, audio. Bafflers in the vents.
Heat sensors. Motion sensors.
Probably enough microwaves
in that office to cook a chicken.
Sorry we had to mislead you.
But this is the worst breach
in the history of US intelligence.
Unusual steps were required.
Good news is you got your wish.
You're in the middle of
the biggest case we've ever run.
Come with me. There's some
people I want you to meet.
He badges out at five-twelve,
stopped at his dry cleaners...
...drove by Dead-Drop Ellis,
then went home.
How does that compare
with the previous Thursday?
Has the Agency been briefed on this?
If it deals with Russian sources, then
the Agency has to be briefed on it.
Does Hanssen have any leave time coming?
How many people are working on this?
About fifty on the Bigot List so far.
- Is the Director involved?
- Director's running the case.
- He sees your pages everyday.
- No.
Yes.
Keep them coming, by the way.
Our audio's missing about 90%,
of what Hanssen says in there.
- He mumbles.
- He does a lot of things, this guy.
- Why don't we just arrest him?
- Can't do that.
He knows the names and locations
of every source we ever turned.
If we can't get him to talk,
their lives are all at risk.
Eric O'Neill, Dean Plesac.
Assistant Special Agent in Charge.
Sir.
Director wants him caught
in the act of making a drop.
That would give you
the Death Penalty.
- Don't you think he's earned it?
- I'll see you, Dean.
Thanks for coming in, Rich.
Like I said, kid,
take nothing personally.
Kate.
He's got an appointment at
the DIA tomorrow at two, right?
- Yeah.
- You're driving him?
- Yeah.
- Good.
We need him out of the office
for at least three hours.
That's when we'll be
sweeping his car.
- Okay.
- How long will it take you...
...to download the data card
off his Palm Pilot?
20, 30 minutes depending
on the level of encryption.
But you can't.
He never lets it out of his sight.
Assuming we can separate it
from him, 20 to 30 minutes.
Okay.
- What's this?
- You want to be read in, right?
Wait.
What if he's smarter than I am?
I've never misread anybody
this badly before.
Except maybe you.
A couple of years ago...
...the Bureau put together a task force.
Lots of assets
had been disappearing.
Sources like Motorin, Martynov.
Dozens of them vanishing,
so this task force was formed...
...to find the mole
who was giving them up.
Our best analysts poring over
data for years looking for the guy.
But they could
never quite find him.
Guess who we put in charge
of the task force?
He was smarter than all of us.
Actually, I can live with that part.
It's the idea that my entire career...
...has been a waste of time,
that's the part I hate.
Everything I've done
since I got to this office...
...everything we've all been
paid to do, he was undoing it.
We all could have
just stayed home.
Dear friends, thank you for
the fifty thousand dollars.
As far as the funds are concerned,
I have little need or utility...
...for more than a hundred thousand
at any one time.
My security concerns
may seem excessive.
I believe experience
has shown them to be necessary.
I am much safer
if you know little about me.
Neither of us are children
about these things.
I was unable to locate
the package...
...based on your description
last night.
Please recognize that
I am in a business suit...
...and cannot slog around
in inch-deep mud.
Your service has recently
suffered some setbacks.
I warn you that Mister Boris
Yuzhin, Mister Sergey Motorin...
...and Mister Valery Martynov...
...have all been recruited
by our special services.
The US can be errantly liked
to a powerfully-built...
...but retarded child,
potentially dangerous...
...but young, immature
and easily manipulated.
I found the site empty.
Empty sites bother me.
I like to know before I commit myself...
...as I'm sure you do also.
One might propose...
...that I am either insanely
brave or quite insane.
I'd answer neither.
I'd say insanely loyal.
Take your pick, there's
insanity in all the answers.
Eventually I would
appreciate an escape plan.
Nothing lasts forever.
Sincerely, Ramon.
- Hi.
- Hi.
You're back.
Boss!
When did you get here?
Very disappointed in you,
young man.
Leaving your bride all alone
without telling her where you'd be.
Not good, Eric.
Where were you?
My mother fell.
I had to go see her.
- Did she break anything?
- No.
- Just bumped her head.
- That's awful!
Write down their address for me,
would you?
- I'd like to send some flowers.
- That's very kind of you, boss.
We couldn't reach you
on your pager.
- On your hip. Twenty-four seven.
- I know, the battery died.
- Sorry, honey, I should have called.
- It's okay.
Juliana was just telling us
what it was like...
...to grow up in the Communist Bloc.
It piques my curiosity,
as you can imagine.
Hope it hasn't felt like
an interrogation, Juliana.
And here we are.
Bonnie, you really didn't have
to go to all this trouble.
It's just leftovers.
I guess I just couldn't stand
the thought of you two...
...ordering from that
Peking Wall place again.
Even Chinese people can't eat
Chinese every night, Eric.
Besides, how's this tiny
thing gonna give you...
...a house full of babies if you
don't put some protein in her diet?
Would you like to say Grace, Eric?
Sweetheart.
I'm sorry, Jule.
I didn't invite them, obviously.
But they thought
it would be okay, Eric.
You have to have boundaries,
even with a boss.
And what was that bullshit
about your mom bumping her head?
- That's complicated.
- Complicated as in...
...I wouldn't understand
or as in you can't tell me?
I'm tired.
I just want to grab
a drink and go to bed.
Are you gonna quit?
I want you to quit.
I felt sick all day, Eric.
It's like you're someone else
when he's around.
I'm sorry it's been
a stressful day for you.
Let's not make it worse.
I don't know...
maybe it's me.
Maybe you want me
to be someone else, too.
Maybe you want me
to be Bonnie or something.
- Knock it off, Jule.
- That'd be easier for you, wouldn't it?
If I were more of an FBI
kind of wife, like she is?
- I'm not kidding, Juliana, shut up.
- If I just went to church every day...
...wanted to spend
my life being pregnant.
I mean, your parents
would probably love that.
- Enough.
- Then you wouldn't have to worry...
...anymore if I was Catholic enough...
- ...or American enough!
- Shut up, goddamn it!
Eric.
Hey, Dad.
How long you been out here?
I don't know.
About an hour or two.
It's freezing.
Why don't you let yourself in?
- You ever quit anything, Dad?
- Did I ever quit anything?
Yeah.
I think I gave up
a paper route once.
- Got tired of waking up so early.
- What your father say?
Nothing.
He just shrugged.
He could kill you
with those shrugs.
I've been thinking about him
a lot this morning.
I don't know why.
Well, it's a lot to put
on yourself, son.
I mean, he was just
a kid doing his duty.
Like you.
"Get on the boat, do your job,
get back home again".
That's what he said to me
the first time I shipped out.
He knew I was scared
so he just kept it simple.
Maybe I should
have gone to Annapolis.
It always seemed to me
that your joining the Bureau...
...was an apology for
not going to Annapolis.
Which you never had to do.
- That's what you wanted.
- No.
I wanted you to serve your country.
Isn't that what you're doing?
Yeah.
So you can't quit, can you?
Get on the boat, do your job,
get back home again.
Can you do that?
His appointment's in five minutes.
Media room, first floor.
You'll get a page
when he's in-pocket.
Obviously if he takes his
Palm Pilot with him...
...you call me, we shut it down.
It might not be the best day
to do this, sir.
He's due at the DIA at two.
I'm driving him.
Looks like you're
in for a full day.
Boss, I just realized
I totally screwed something up.
- Don't you knock?
- I'm sorry.
The photographer for your 25 year
portrait is here today.
I had it in my book
for next week, but it's today.
They called me on my cell.
Your appointment's in five minutes.
Then you'll just have
to reschedule, won't you?
We shouldn't. He's only
here once a month. I'm so sorry.
I'm supposed to drop everything I'm
doing and run down there?
In this.
- That's how you dress every day?
- No.
- There's a spot on my tie.
- Let me look.
- Lord!
- Sorry.
Clumsy!
Look at that.
It's everywhere.
Boss, please.
Just get down there.
You don't want
to miss your picture.
I'll have all this cleaned up
by the time you get back.
- I've got the DIA at two.
- I'll get you there. No problem.
Are you finding
this job stressful, Eric?
Is this all too much for you?
Sometimes.
Then pray more.
Yes, sir.
Mister Hanssen.
Nice to meet you.
I'm John.
We've got a spot
for you right over here.
Twenty-five years, huh?
That's quite a prideful thing.
This we don't need.
You know something...
...there's a little too much bounce
on your nose. We don't want that.
Would you be opposed to just
the slightest touch of base?
Very nice.
Sit up a bit straighter.
Good. Little bit
of a smile, and excellent.
Keep thinking
those patriotic thoughts...
...and that's good, a little straighter.
Beautiful.
Excellent.
- You're gonna love that one.
- Stop!
Stop.
Mister Hanssen,
we can get another tie.
I don't like being scrutinized.
I found you.
I was on my way to the range
so I called your office.
I thought
I might finally see if...
...you're the dead shot
I've been hearing you were.
Look, maybe
some other time, Rich.
- I'm not in the mood just now.
- Me neither.
Let's take it out on some targets.
Fine.
Shameful.
Double or nothing?
Wrong pocket.
Shit.
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners now...
...and at the hour of our death.
Amen.
Sorry.
- How'd it go?
- It didn't.
I don't know why they thought
I'd just sit there while...
...some faggot photographer
got his jollies.
- I've got work to do.
- Should I reschedule?
No.
- Have you been in my briefcase?
- No.
I just had to move it
so it wouldn't get soaked.
The water was everywhere.
Why, did I put it back wrong?
Sir?
All right, let's go.
Would you like to hear
some music, sir?
Yes, I'm in the mood
for some Andrews sisters.
- They got any in here?
- Not to my knowledge, sir.
I didn't think so.
That's good.
- You've got until five.
- Yes, sir.
Clear.
Jesus.
This guy could park at the bottom
of the Potomac and come out firing.
Yes, sir.
He just arrived.
I see.
Yes, sir, I understand.
Absolutely. Yes, sir.
I have some bad news,
Agent Hanssen.
We're gonna have
to cut this meeting short.
- I don't understand.
- That was my superior.
He's called me into
an emergency meeting.
I'm sorry.
- Does he know that I'm here?
- Yes, sir.
- Does he know who I am?
- I made that clear to him, yes.
He wants me to reschedule
at your convenience.
- No, thanks.
- Sir?
This visit was a courtesy.
Let's go.
Maybe there's somebody else
who can show us around.
Get the car.
Boss, I'm sorry.
I was doing you
a favor bringing you along.
I know I spoke out of turn.
When somebody takes a shit
on you, you don't reschedule.
He wasn't called into any meeting.
It's a power play.
- I didn't see it that way.
- That's why you're still a clerk.
- What's he looking for?
- Okay.
Just take me back to the office.
- Plesac.
- They're on their way back.
The meeting took 20 minutes.
They're on Wilson Boulevard, heading back.
Sew it up.
- Sir?
- We're aborting. Sew it up.
How about that?
The Parkway's wide open.
I hate the Parkway.
Take E Street.
There's construction on E Street.
I heard that on the radio this morning.
- So take Constitution.
- Sir, I'm SSG.
We tail people for a living.
- Parkway's faster.
- Is that a fact?
Let's go. Let's go.
I just paged him.
Where are we?
I'm not sure yet.
Maybe screwed.
- Imbecile.
- I'm sorry.
- Idiot.
- I'm sorry.
Is this what they teach you
in ghosting school?
No wonder the Bureau
can never find anyone.
Just relax.
Don't tell me to relax.
What are you doing?
I can sit here for an hour.
Or I can walk two blocks...
...get on the other side of
this bottle neck by myself...
and take a five minute
cab ride back to the office.
Now which do you think would better
serve the needs of the Bureau?
It's just traffic.
- Hanssen's on foot.
- Good God.
I put him back at the office
in ten minutes, best case.
- Your boy's killing us.
- He'll be fine.
Shit.
Boss.
You gotta get back in the truck, sir.
Haven't you made enough
mistakes for one day, Eric?
Now you want to throw in
a traffic violation?
Sir, you have to get back
in the truck.
- Well, why should I?
- Look, don't kill me, okay?
- I did something stupid.
- What a shock.
I lied to you, sir.
There isn't any construction on
E Street. I made that up.
What would you do that for?
Because I need your help.
And I was afraid to ask
if we could make an extra stop.
I wanted to go back
to the Reading Room, sir.
The Catholic Information Center.
I sort of have to.
Why?
It's Juliana.
We've been fighting all week.
- About what?
- To be honest, sir. Your church.
She didn't like it, boss.
She didn't get it.
So I wanted to go back
to the Reading Room...
...I thought there might
be some books...
...I could get for her to help her
see things better.
Figured if we were driving right past,
you might wanna pull in.
It was stupid, I know.
But there it is.
- You swear to God?
- Excuse me?
Swear to God...
...that everything
you just told me is true.
No. I'm not gonna do that.
I wouldn't lie about my wife.
Or the church.
If you don't know that by now,
then I sure as hell wouldn't...
...take the Lord's name in vain
just to prove it to you.
You know something, sir.
You do test people too much.
And I've had it.
I was asking for your help.
Have a nice walk, sir.
I'll see you back at the office.
Maybe, maybe I overstepped.
- Yeah?
- O'Neill just talked him back in.
- How'd he manage that?
- Hard to say.
From here it looks like he might
have proposed marriage.
He talked him back in the car.
- This needs to be mailed.
- You're not coming in, sir?
I don't have
to account to you, do I?
No, sir.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- What are you watching?
- Nothing.
Just a training tape
on surveillance.
Hanssen wanted me to make
sure the transfer was okay.
Would you mind getting the rest
of the groceries for me, honey?
Just a few more bags in the car.
- How was school?
- It was fine. I'm just tired.
Jule.
- A training tape on surveillance?
- This is not what it looks like.
What it looks like is he's making
pornos of Bonnie...
...except she doesn't know about it.
Everybody told me when you married
the Bureau, things get weird.
The cases.
They never told me about this.
This has nothing
to do with the case.
So you aren't just steaming open
his mail, he gave it to you?
I gotta go.
- Do you trust me?
- Yes.
Because I think you've got
this idea somehow...
...that telling me the truth
about him would mean...
...you were betraying
your country or something.
It wouldn't.
It's okay.
He's a creep,
I knew that already.
It's just...
he's been in our home,
we keep fighting about him.
I'd just like
to know what this is.
Can't you tell me?
Please.
I don't know when I'll be back.
I think my wife just read herself
into the case.
That was a colossally
stupid thing to do!
You could jeopardize this entire
investigation. Are you an idiot?
You know you're as much
to blame for this as anybody.
I'm telling so many lies now,
I can't keep them straight anymore.
You want to make things easier?
The next time Hanssen
gives you a package...
...and he tells you to mail it,
you mail it.
That package was re-sealed...
- ...as you found it, right?
- Yes.
There's no trace that
it had ever been opened?
Nothing that would ever arouse
suspicion on the other end?
No, I posted it from
the Bureau five minutes ago.
- It was pristine.
- We'll see.
Look,...
...I'm sorry you're
having problems at home.
I'd offer you some advice,
but it wouldn't be worth much.
I don't even have a cat.
All I can tell you...
...is you keep your head on
straight and you do your job.
It's your best shot of getting
this over with, understand?
We pulled three hundred pages
of classified material out of...
...a Lawn and Leaf Bag
from his trunk today.
And quite a bit of correspondence
from the Palm Pilot.
His next drop appears to be imminent.
Unless, of course...
...somebody does something
to make him suspicious.
- Right.
- Right.
I really should
be getting back to this.
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.
Is it worth it?
Being an agent.
What it costs.
Do you think it's worth it?
Ask me when we've caught him.
- Eric.
- Yes, boss.
Come in here,
I want to show you something.
This is the address of
my mechanic in Manassas.
I'm dropping my car off on Monday.
I'm gonna need you to pick
me up and bring me into work.
No later than eight-fifteen.
Is something wrong
with your car, sir?
Yeah, I'm having it swept.
For electronic devices.
Been sensing signal bursts
coming through my radio lately and...
car alarms go off when I drive past.
It's not beneath
the Russians to track me.
I'm tailed all the time.
- They know how much I know.
- Yes, sir.
You know this movie?
- She's very appealing.
- Yes, sir. I've always thought so.
Would you close the door
on your way out?
What happened?
We just got the encryption
off this one.
His last letter to his handlers
in the SVR two days ago.
- He's going to ground, isn't he?
- Yes.
Then we're dead.
"Dear Friends, I thank you for
your assistance these many years.
It seems however that my greatest
utility to you has come to an end.
And it is time to seclude
myself from active service.
Since communicating last,
and one wonders if because of it...
...I have been promoted to a higher
do-nothing senior executive job...
...outside of regular access
to information...
...within the counterintelligence program.
It is as if I am being isolated.
Furthermore, I believe
I have detected repeated bursting...
...radio signal emanations
from my vehicle.
I have not found their source,
but as you wisely do...
...I will leave this alone, for knowledge
of their existence is sufficient.
Amusing the games children play.
In this, however,
I strongly suspect...
...that you should have concerns
for the integrity of your...
...compartment concerning knowledge
of my efforts on your behalf.
Something has aroused
the sleeping tiger.
Perhaps you know better than I.
Life is full of its ups and downs.
Yours truly, Ramon."
Okay, if he doesn't make
another drop, what do we have?
We've got the Palm Pilot.
It still gives us conspiracy
to commit espionage.
Until he walks into a court with
a lawyer who says everything on...
...the Palm Pilot was just notes for
a spy novel he was planning to write.
What about the evidence
in his trunk?
Unauthorized Possession
of Classified Material.
That's five years.
Hardly enough to make him talk.
Maybe we just
keep promoting him.
Might be the only way
to keep him from retiring.
- Shit.
- He's outside your apartment.
What?
He's parked outside your
apartment. Just pulled up.
It's him.
- How drunk did he sound?
- He wasn't slurring or anything.
Maybe a little surlier than usual,
but that's about it.
- The guy's melting down.
- That would bother me a lot less...
...if he didn't have a dozen guns
in his trunk.
Drop me off here, okay?
- It's right around the corner.
- I know where it is.
We got a team on his tail, right?
Can we pull them back?
- Why would I want to do that?
- I think I can still work him.
I think I can get him
to make that drop.
Do you need me to read
that letter again, Eric?
There is no drop.
He's going to ground.
No, he's dying to make it.
We just have to make him feel safe.
- What if he's made you?
- What if he has?
Bumper-locking him is not
gonna make me any safer.
Please. I can handle it.
Okay.
I'll call Dean.
Ten minutes as promised.
Caught me coming right
out of the Metro.
- So why didn't you drive?
- Juliana needed the car.
- I felt like walking, anyway.
- Why?
- Something on your mind?
- Not especially.
- Now, get in. I want some company.
- Sure.
- You've been drinking, sir?
- Can I trust you?
Of course.
Don't you know that?
I don't know
what I know anymore.
Is this the music of
your childhood or something?
That's the music of
my father's childhood.
What's in Rock Creek?
I like to park at night.
I have to be sure
that I can trust you.
Why don't we go back to the office?
You can polygraph me.
- Ever heard of Aldrich Ames?
- Of course.
Worst spy in US history.
Sold two-point-five million dollars
worth of information to the Soviets.
And passed every polygraph
the Agency gave him.
But he never would
have gotten past me.
I can read anyone.
I'm getting really tired
of that pager.
What are we doing?
I told you the FBI's a gun culture.
You can't advance here
unless you can shoot.
Boss.
They test you at twenty-five yards...
...fifteen yards, seven yards
and five yards.
- What are you doing?
- You want to be an agent or don't you?
Prone. Left hand, right hand.
Five yards with gun in holster.
You get three seconds
to fire five shots.
- What are you doing?
- Who was calling you in the car?
- What?
- I need to know if I can trust you.
- Put the gun down, boss.
- Who was calling?
- Put the fucking gun down!
- I need to know if I can trust you.
Can I trust you? Jesus!
God sakes, what is wrong with you?
Look around you, boss.
It's just us out here.
Nobody's tailing you,
there isn't any GPS on your car...
...and I'm not a foreign agent
trying to work you.
You don't matter that much.
The page was from Juliana,
obviously. My wife.
She's trying to reach me because
I told her I'd be home by now...
...and because we're in another fight,
caused by you, as usual.
Thanks for dropping by
unannounced...
...and lecturing her about Opus Dei,
that was real helpful.
And thanks for staring at her
in church like she was from Mars.
That also worked out great.
Let me guess.
You were testing her, too.
You know, she asked me
this morning why you're like this.
Why you grind everybody so hard.
I had all these answers ready.
"He's misunderstood."
"He's trying to fix the Bureau
and no one will listen."
"He was born in the wrong century."
"His father's a jerk."
I got a whole list.
But you know something, sir?
At the end of the day,
it's all crap.
You are who you are.
The why doesn't mean
a thing, does it?
Does it?
I matter plenty.
- Yes, Eric?
- Put the tail back on him.
He'll make the drop.
Tomorrow.
- Maybe even tonight.
- You're not burnt?
- No, I'm not burnt.
- Okay, we're on it.
- FBI!
- FBI! Don't move!
- Don't move!
- Don't move!
Guns won't be necessary.
Guns won't be necessary.
Anything in your pockets
I should know about?
No.
- Do you have a weapon on you?
- No.
So it wasn't a ghost.
- Maybe now you'll listen.
- It's a sad day for all of us, Bob.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.
Everything's fine.
I'm sorry.
Can I give you some advice, Bob?
I've been in on a few of these now.
Nicholson. Aldridge Ames.
It goes a lot easier
if you cooperate.
On you.
On your family.
You really oughta do an overhaul
on your GPS units, Dean.
They throw off a signal burst.
Through the radio.
I heard it coming through
mine for weeks.
Even if all you give them
is why you did it...
...it buys you some good will.
That's what Ames did at first.
Just gave up the why.
That mustn't have taken long.
All Ames cared about was the money.
Why else would he have done it?
It's not so hard to guess, is it?
Considering the human ego.
Can you imagine sitting in a room,
with a bunch of your colleagues?
Everybody trying to guess
the identity of a mole.
And all the while
it's you they're after.
It's you they're looking for.
That must be very satisfying,
wouldn't you think?
Or maybe he considered
himself a patriot.
Maybe he saw it as his duty to show
us how lax our security was.
We can't rule that out as
a possibility. Or maybe he...
What good does speculating do?
He spied.
The why doesn't mean a thing.
Does it?
No, I guess it doesn't.
Two guys on a boat.
You see the Director's press
conference?
Funny about those things.
He thanked the CIA,
and the US Attorney's office...
...and the Council
for Intelligence Policy...
...but he couldn't thank the guy
we put behind that desk.
I didn't expect him to.
I'm headed over
to the Field Office.
We still have two
Russian IO's unaccounted for.
That mean you won't be
headed over there with me?
I thought I'd go home instead.
You're gonna make agent, Eric.
That's set now.
- Isn't that what you wanted?
- It was.
Until you came over to my apartment
and saw the TV dinners and no cat?
No.
Most of our agents are married,
you know.
All their spouses get used to
the life eventually. So will Juliana.
I don't think I want her to.
That's different.
Yeah.
You do know what
you did here, right?
That was the worst spy in
American history you brought down.
Now you're just gonna walk away?
Couldn't you think of
a better time to walk away?
Nope.
So...
You think it'd be okay if I...
I'd say you earned it.
Good luck, Eric.
You, too.
Pray for me.
I will.
