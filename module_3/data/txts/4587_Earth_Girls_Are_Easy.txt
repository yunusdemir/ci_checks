YOU'RE INCREDIBLE.
WELL, IT WAS EASY.
I STARTED ON POODLES.
GOOD?
REAL GOOD.
OK. OK.
GROUP PICTURE. COME ON.
COME ON.
GET DOWN THERE.
ALL RIGHT...
NOW SAY,
VELVEETA SLICES.
SL--VEGAKLD.
VEL--SALKSI.
OK, YOU GUYS,
WHAT'S THE PLAN FOR TONIGHT?
WHOA! CANDY,
REALITY CHECK.
WE CAN'T GO OUT.
THEY'RE ALIENS!
SO? THEY CAN STILL
BE DATES!
DO YOU GUYS HAVE MARGARITAS
ON YOUR PLANET?
IT'S NOT SAFE.
I'LL TAKE YOU HOME.
DON'T GET YOUR PANTIES
IN A BUNCH.
WE'RE WITH MAJOR CUTE GUYS.
IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT!
COME ON!
YOU GUYS ARE SO LUCKY
YOU CRASHED IN THE VALLEY.
IT'S THE BADDEST PLACE
ON EARTH.
CANDY, SIT DOWN!
HI, SWEETS.
I THINK WE'D LIKE TO KEEP
A LOW PROFILE, CANDY.
GUYS, WHAT YOU
DOING LATER?
I NEVER WOULD HAVE BELIEVED
THAT THIS COULD HAPPEN.
THAT YOU'D BE CRUISING
WITH SHAVED MARTIANS?
NO. THAT TED WOULD
DO THIS TO ME.
GIVE MEN ENOUGH ROPE,
THEY'LL DIG THEIR OWN GRAVE.
SO TRUE.
HE SAID HE WANTED
ONE LAST FLING.
MAYBE THAT'S NORMAL,
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M SURE
WE'LL BE HAPPY ONCE WE'RE MARRIED,
BUT I CAN'T PRETEND
THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN.
VALERIE, YOU WORK HARD
TO MAKE TED HAPPY.
WHO IS MAKING YOU HAPPY?
WOO!
WOO!

OH, GOD.

YOU GUYS,

JUST ACT HUMAN.
OH, SWEETHEART,
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.
OH, I WAS SO WORRIED
ABOUT YOU.
WHEN I CAME HOME,
THE HOUSE WAS WRECKED.
WHO ARE THEY?
WHO?
THOSE GUYS?
YEAH.
A BAND.
BOY,
I'M TOTALLY CLEAR.
[HUMMING]
YOU MEAN LIKE
A ROCK 'N' ROLL BAND?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH A BAND, VAL?
I WON THEM
ON MTV.
I WON AN MTV WEEKEND
WITH A BAND.
HI. I AM, UH, MAC.
HOW IS IT HANGING,
MR. DUDE?
DR. DUDE.
DR. DUDE?
I CAME HOME
TO TALK TO YOU ALONE.
THIS IS PRIVATE.
I'M SURE YOU WON'T MIND
WHEN I ASK YOU TO LEAVE.
THEY CAN'T LEAVE.
THEY'RE SPENDING THE WEEKEND.
THIS IS MY HOUSE.
YOUR HOUSE? WAIT.
I THREW YOU OUT, DR. LOVE.
I'M GOING TO
THROW <i>THEM</i> OUT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THAT?
NO, YOU'RE NOT.
YES, I AM.
I WON THEM.
WHAT?
YOU'RE TEARING
ME APART!
YOU HAVE NO BUSINESS BEING
WITH THESE WEIRD PEOPLE.
I NEVER WON
A BAND BEFORE. THEY'RE STAYING.
I WANT YOU
TO BE HAPPY, BUT--
YEE-WAH.
AH!
HE WAS GOOD.
YOU ANIMAL!
I OUGHT TO GIVE YOU
A TRACHEOTOMY.

HE WAS EATING
MY BLUE-GILLED DORKY.
WATCH YOUR MOUTH!
10-13. WE GOT
A FALSE REPORT.
JUST A DOMESTIC
DISPUTE.
HIS GIRLFRIEND
DUMPED HIM FOR A ROCK BAND.
BULLSHIT!
LET'S GO WHERE
YOU CAN COOL OFF.
I'M A DOCTOR!
IF WE BUST YOUR ARM,
YOU CAN PUT ON YOUR OWN CAST.

WHAT DOES
VALERIE WANT?
I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST WANT

MAC COULD MAKE
VALERIE HAPPY.
THANKS, BUT I DON'T THINK
ANYBODY COULD MAKE ME FEEL
VERY GOOD RIGHT NOW.
MAC COULD MAKE
VALERIE FEEL
VERY, VERY GOOD.
WAIT A MINUTE.
ARE YOU COMING ON TO ME?
IS THIS A PASS?
BECAUSE IF IT IS,
SEX IS TOTALLY OUT OF THE QUESTION.
WHAT IS SEX?
SEX? YOU KNOW,
MAKING LOVE.
A MAN AND A WOMAN

THEIR CLOTHES OFF, AND...
OK.
WELL, NO, NO, NO!
WE CAN'T BECAUSE
ME AND TED ARE, UH...
I GUESS WE'RE NOT,
BUT, I MEAN, UH...
WE CAN'T BECAUSE
YOU'RE AN ALIEN,
AND I'M FROM THE VALLEY.
WE MAY NOT EVEN BE
ANATOMICALLY CORRECT FOR EACH OTHER.
THAT COULD BE
A REAL PROBLEM.
[ZIPPER UNZIPS]
NO PROBLEM.
BUT, I MEAN, UH,
NO, NO, NO.

SHE DROVE HER CAR

I'M ALWAYS DOING THAT.
PRETTY RAD CAR, THOUGH.
WHERE IS IT MADE?
FINLAND.
FINLAND.            FINLAND.
OH, I HEARD OF THAT.
TED, BRINGING THAT GIRL
HERE WAS INEXCUSABLE.
NOW THAT
I'VE SLEPT ON IT,
I COULD PROBABLY
FORGIVE YOU,
BUT WHAT ABOUT
CALLING OFF THE WEDDING?
SWEETHEART,
I DIDN'T MEAN THAT.
MARRYING YOU IS THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING IN THE WORLD.
I NEED YOU
TO TAKE CARE OF ME.
I WON'T SO MUCH
AS LOOK AT ANOTHER WOMAN,
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
I'M GIVING HER
A PHYSICAL EXAMINATION.
A RELATIONSHIP IS
LIKE A PORCELAIN NAIL--
YOU CAN BREAK IT,
YOU CAN GLUE IT BACK TOGETHER,
BUT IT WON'T BE
AS STRONG AS BEFORE
UNLESS THE PERSON'S
COMMITTED AND NOT BRINGING HOME NURSES.
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN ME
TODAY, MAN.
NOTHING BUT RADICAL RIPS
