I'm going to take better care of myself.

I will not lose my temper

I'll worry less about money.
OK, let's synchronise your watch.
OK.
10.27, and I'll be finished at noon.
I can be home by 12.30.
I can shower, nap, have lunch.
By 12.45, we could be having sex.
- You know, I figured out my problem.
- Yeah? Share it with me.
God hates me.
Jay, God loves everybody.
Not this horse.
That's why I'd like to have one day...
You'll never understand.
It's OK, it means nothing.
- It's not important.
- I'd like to understand. Explain it to me.
You can be walking around lucky

- Excuse me?
- The fortune.
That's what the fortune says. "You can

Lovely.
Well, you know what mine says?
- "Stand by your man."
- Fabulous!
- I'll save that. Take another.
- You ruined it. I'll take this one.
- How could I ruin it?
- You touched it.
- I didn't open it.
- If you touch it, it's your fortune.
It's pointing to you.
How do you know what it means?
- There are rules.
- What?
The international rules of fortune cookie
taking? Want me to lose my temper?
- Look...
- Excuse me!
Sorry. What happens when you touch
someone else's cookie?
- It's no good any more.
- See?
- I never heard that.
- If you open it, it's your fortune.
- Are you an authority? Shut up and eat!
- No, you got to eat it or it doesn't count!
- I don't believe this!
- Only a cookie.
It's not just a cookie!

You know that? The man just said

- What? You like the odds on lightning?
- These are guys rehearsing for a play!
Give me a break! What did he say?
The horse runs on Saturday.
What is it now? It's...
...it's Saturday right now!
Trotter, what's the matter with you?
I don't know. I feel different.
Oh, yeah! Different than what?
- I can't explain this. Play the tape again.
- Trotter!
Remember something?
You gave up gambling.
This would not be gambling.
Gambling involves risk. It involves
chance. It involves uncertainty.
This is just taking advantage of an
extraordinary business opportunity.

- I think he's dead.
- Hey, Looney, here it is.
- Charity, the four horse.
- Might be a late scratch.
- 40-1 on the "Morning Line"! Jesus!
- That'll go down. I like the Packers.
I'm not kidding. This horse is a real dog!
Listen to this, "Not in this lifetime."
Perfect!
I might bet a half on the Packers.
Who knows? They may not lose too bad.
Who knows? Maybe you'll get

- It's eight! I'd stake my life!
- There's a $2 minimum bet.
- Lo Fat? What's that, milk?
This horse stinks,
but I'm betting 150 on his nose.
- 150 what?
- The number's the key!
- The odds?
- The number came to me as you got in!

I would stop gambling.

- Like this room.
- Yes.
Normally, I don't like to bet the favourite,
but $2,500 times two is $5,000.
Do you come here...
- ...often?
- Every day.
- Really? You gamble every day?
- Of course.
Do you...
Has gambling affected your home life?
Ruined it.
Has gambling affected your reputation?
Honey, some people like
to rub me for luck.
Hurry up with that rum!
- You feel lucky?
- I'm hot.
I can tell.
Lord...Byron.
- I like Lord Byron.
- I love Lord Byron.
I think I'll go bet it.
- Hi, Charley.
- Hi, Vicki.
- Sorry!
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Excuse me.
- Sorry. Really.
- Can I get you anything?
- No, thanks.
- Flowers?
- No, thank you.
Quaaludes?
One more collision like that,
you're getting glasses!
Hey, what did I do? What did I do?
There he is!
- You won't be picking any more pockets!
- What's going on?
- You have the right to remain silent.
- I want the right to bet Lord Byron!
- Let's go, Morgan!
- Morgan? I'm not Morgan!
Vibes, tell them who I am!
Tell the police officers who I am!
I've never seen this man before.
I'll kill you! I can't believe
you did this to me!
- We got Morgan here.
- I'm not Morgan!
- Do I look like a Morgan?
- Sit down and shut up! We got Morgan!
- I am not Morgan, goddammit!
- Swearing in public's illegal.
- So is false arrest.
- Home address?
- You're not calling my wife?
<i>- The horses are at the starting gate.</i>
- This is costing me $5,000!
- Quiet!
Hey!
- Blast him!
- You can't shoot a pickpocket!
- Out of the way!
- It must be a commercial.
Why are you handcuffed?
Outta the way!
Uh...ah...uh!
<i>(PA) He's going in. Vague Lady</i>
<i>a little restless inside the gate.</i>
<i>The flag is up!</i>
- (BELL)
- Don't! No! No!
- He did it!
- What did I do?
Everything!
<i>(PA) Mismatch moves up</i>
<i>on the outside...</i>
How do you explain
the $2,400 hidden in your shoes?
- I'm having a very good day!
- We're checking on a Mr J Trotter.
I'll kill you!
2232 Flamingo Lane.
Aargh!
- He said he worked for you.
<i>- A shocking incident of bumping!</i>
<i>Lord Byron has lost the rider!</i>
<i>Going through, Splendid Reason...</i>
- You do know him?
<i>- Splendid Reason wins!</i>
<i>Lord Byron leads, and Arctic Dancer...</i>
<i>A shocking incident of bumping!</i>
<i>Lord Byron has lost the rider!</i>
- That is a shocking incident of bumping.
<i>- Splendid Reason wins!</i>
- I didn't lose.
<i>- Arctic Dancer second...</i>
Weirder and weirder.
- I had the winner.
- I didn't lose.
I should have lost, but I didn't lose.
There's a fine line
between winning and losing.
Yes, the finish line.
When you're rich,
you don't worry about losing.
I sell envelopes.
If I lose 10 grand at the track,
I add half a cent to the prices
of my birthday envelopes.
I'll take six dozen.
<i>(PA) Dr Trotter, Dr J Trotter,</i>
<i>please pick up</i>
<i>the nearest courtesy phone.</i>
Excuse me.
Come back, Doctor.
Some doctor!
Right over there, sir.
<i>(PA) Calling trainer Mel Stutey.</i>
<i>- Please contact the jockey's room.</i>
- Dr Trotter.
Follow me, sir.
Miss Vicki.
- Is that caviar fresh?
- Yes, sir.
And a little champagne. Excellent.
Hi, honey, I knew it was you.
Trotter, sweetheart, honey darling,
help me out here? What day is it?
It's Saturday, babe. Why?
Saturday! Good. I see.
I don't want to assume something
I shouldn't. What time is it?
It's 1.45, doll.
"1.45, doll"!
And where are you right now?
The Jockey Club. You called me.
Yes, of course.
So, if what you're saying is true,
you are in the Jockey Club at the
racetrack at 1.45 Saturday afternoon,
when you were supposed to be home
at 12.30 starting our marriage over!
Son of a bitch! What am I going
to do with you? You lousy bum!
- I hate your guts, as usual!
- Listen...
How could you do this to me?
What am I saying?
How could you not do this? How could
I expect you to do anything but this?
You're hopeless!
<i>I'm just as hopeless to think you'd have</i>
<i>any consideration for my feelings.</i>
<i>- Jesus!</i>
- Excuse me!
This is a private conversation.
Thank you. I really appreciate it.
You're gambling...
I am not gambling! I am not gambling!
I am winning!
Liar, liar, pants on fire!
Really! I wouldn't kid you. I'm up $2,500.
I'm having a very good day.
Are you? Well, good day this, baby!
I'm calling my attorney
and telling him to go for your balls!
- Listen...
- You know, I think this is it.
I'm finished. We are history!
- Pam, don't panic. Get all gussied up...
- You want me to get gussied up?
Come down here and see.
You won't believe what's going on!
If I do, it'll be you that won't believe
what's going on!
Be here in half an hour. I love you.
Trotter? Trotter!
<i>#</i> Ba-ba-ba-bum... <i>#</i>
Bastard!
Maybe one more time.
But after that, no more.
I thought we'd find you at that dump
across the street.
- Marty's, where all the pigs wallow.
- I like your shoes.
- Buy them at a carpet sale?
- Let me throw him out the window.
I hope someday you're two seconds late.
Where's your friend, Looney?
- He's not my friend.
- He's late with some money.
- I wouldn't know.
- Hundreds late. Sickeningly late.
Bernie, I swear to God, I hate this.
Makes my stomach turn.
Next week, it's me giving you this back.
The races make me nervous.
You can't beat an animal.
Looney's in trouble. He bet the Packers.
- So?
- He bet them pretty hard.
They lost 75-10, and your pal,
Looney, went in for a nickel.
I thought he only bet $50.
Your friend's down $800,
and some change.
Which is a lot for a bum.
When you see your buddy, please
pass along this message, "Pay up."
PS, "Or else!"
I don't think I'll be seeing Mr Looney
any time soon. Excuse me.
Seen Looney?
I may go and draw some savings,
come back, and get back what we lost.
- I am pretty mad!
- Seen Looney?
- Everybody's looking for Looney.
- He said you were a jerk.
- Where is he?
- Lufkin's after him. He left a number.
Looney said you turned on your friends.
- He went to give blood.
- We could, and save a trip to the bank!
I am pretty cheesed off about that jockey
falling off that damn horse, Sid!
Looney!
- Looney!
- What?
What are you doing?
Being embalmed,
if it's any business of yours.
- Lufkin is looking for you.
- So?
He says you're over the limit.
- Dead men can't pay.
- Don't go back to the track.
You screwed me.
I didn't! I made the bet that
we were both going to bet!
I lost $50 on the one named the same
as my cat! In the seventh,
one's named the same
as my apartment. I'm going back.
I love the track. Great place to spend
time with your best friend.
- Until he sneaks off and screws you!
<i>- You!</i>
Out!
Give my regards to your new pals
at that whorehouse you're sitting in!
Look...
...tell that guy his blood is rare.
Say he gets $20, not the regular $10.
His blood is rare. He gets $75.
75?
75 twice a week is $150.
That's a lot of money!
- Some Banana Daiquiris.
- Banana King's in the next race.
- Really? Where?
- Where's the money?
- We're married.
- Oh. We're not.
- Why don't I keep the money?
- It's in my shoes.
- Give me the money!
- Aah!
Purse snatchers are everywhere!
Put this on your list, Mr "I won't
gamble"! What happened to that?
At least give me some of the money and
you can keep $10, if you have to bet!
I don't see why you people
can't watch the horses run
and not bet on them.
(WHOLE ROOM LAUGHS )
- She's new!
- What's so damn funny?
Because there is no racing
without betting.
That's poetic.
- Please! Airhead.
- Excuse me?
- I don't want you to lose all our money.
- Pam, darling, sweetheart,
I'm begging you, be quiet.
If you don't give it to me now,
I'll cause a scene.
Remember your mother's house?
The plate glass window?
- I'm going to the men's room.
- Why?
- To take my shoes off.
- I don't trust you one little bit!
You don't want me
to make a scene here!
Terribly sorry.
Here comes the champ!
I admit it, you are the champ!
You got more guts than sense. I love it!
- So, what do you want?
- I don't know.
- You have to give me a number.
- I'll be right back.
I believe you will.
I'm taking a survey. Who do you like?
I like the two horse. It's got front wraps.
I always bet those horses.
- Excuse me, I'm taking a survey...
- Big money on the four. Real money.
- Who do you like?
- I like the six.
- Why?
- I always bet on five.
- Who do you like?
- Up Yours, number one.
- Thank you.
- I like the four.
These other nags'll die. By the eighth
pole, they'll look like they're at a bus stop.
- It's my survey. Take your own.
- I like the six.
- The four.
- The one.
I like the six horse.
- Three!
- What do you mean?
Three to win. Let it ride.
Are you sure?
I mean, of sound mind and all that?
I'm not asking for a will. I want 48 $50
win tickets on three in the seventh race.
48 $50 win tickets
on the three horse in the seventh race?
- That's right.
- I have to give you 48 $50 win tickets
on the three horse in the seventh race?
How much does 48 $50 win tickets
on the three horse
in the seventh race pay?
48 $50 win tickets on the three horse
in the seventh race at...
...25-1 will pay you...
(HE MOUTHS )
- ...approximately $69,000.
- This is a lot of money.
- You won't hold any back, just in case?
- In case what?
In case you get hungry or thirsty
before the race ends?
A-ha.
(MACHINE CLATTERS )
Mmm.
Thanks.
It's quiet.
I do this for a living.
Been doing it for 15 years.
I play the circuit.
One track closes, another one opens.
Some big places, some dumps.
I've met all kinds of characters but,
believe me, pal, you are the champ.
I really hope you win.
Yep, you're the greatest I've ever seen.
- I'll tell the grandchildren about you.
- Thanks.
(BUZZER)
Escort this gentleman
until the end of the race.
Yes, sir.
Hi.
Coming through!
You've been arrested?
Where's the money?
No, no!
- These! No!
- I had to.
- Lying son of a bitch!
- Lay off him!
- Would you mind your own business?
- She's pert, if you like pert.
Hardly nobody likes three.
- Who's she talking about?
- You want another round?
You're sick!
Somebody should put you in a hospital.
I just got it!
I just got something real important.
After all these years, it's not my gambling
that you despised.
It's been my losing!
I'm ending this marriage,
or I'll have a nervous breakdown.
I might be having one right now.
- I'm going home.
- Good.
- Shall I call when I win?
- Yes!
Call this!
My!
- We're having some problems.
- Poor Trotter.
Poor, poor Trotter.
You're looking at $69,000,
or you're looking at nothing.
I've a house in the Bahamas. I love guts!
He's mine! You're mine.

I'm having a fabulous day!
They should guard the door,

- Fix your skirt, for Christ's sakes!
- OK, Bernie.
- Have you ever seen such behaviour?
- Can't hold his liquor!
- You might have mentioned.
- What?
The three horse. You might have
said you liked him.
- Think I'm so rich I don't need any extra?
- Want to know how I got the three?
You want to know how I got it?
I went out in the thing and I...
Screw it!
I hate sneaky people. I knew a sissy kid
in school that covered up his answers.
Who cares? Who cares?
Waiter! More champagne.
We're very busy, sir.
(BLOWS A RASPBERRY)
- That's for all you stuffy rat bastards!

- That is...
- Why, it's outrageous behaviour!
I'm going to collect $69,000!
How gross!

- I'm hiring you all day.
- Don't worry about a thing.

shoot them!
- (YELLS )

No, it's OK! I know this guy!

- No!
Don't shoot yet! I haven't got my money!

- Another curse, I'll blast your head off!
- Really?
- That's correct.
I lost the blood bank money!
Not on a horse! I got my pocket picked.
What is this? Social hour? You owe me,
you bastard! And I'm going to get it!
How much does Mr Looney owe you?
850.
(GROWLS )
I was on the phone.
I was going to bet $50.
Next I'm saying, "500 on the Packers."
It was like somebody else saying it!
Let him kill me! I deserve it!
I'll pay for Looney
when I settle here, OK?
I can get it. I'll kill somebody.
- Watch it!
- When did I last have a winning week?
December 3rd, three years ago. $22.
- Ooh!
- I'm a loser! Let him kill me! I deserve it!
When I collect, I settle his sheet.
I'll owe you for the rest of my life.
You're the greatest man that ever lived.
- I mean that.
- Sounds fine to me.
$69,000! (WHISTLES )
Send champagne to Fleet Dreams'
stall and roses to the owner.
And a case of light beer to the jockey.
I'm not kidding!
Government takes half. That's 34,500.
800 on the Buick, 450 on furniture,
Pam's cruise, that's...
- 430.
- 17,000.
12 years' rent, 200 for champagne,
100 for roses.
- 40.
- 100 for breakages at the Jockey Club.
- 58.
- 850 for Looney's tab, leaves me with...
...zero,
zero, zero.
Congratulations!
I'm broke.
- About that 850 you owe...
- There's all kinds of love in this world.
- I got bad news. I can't afford this...
- The love I got for you is man to man.
You're a prince. You're my king.
- Ah, hell!
- He'll be back.
Not me, pal. I've seen the light.
- Hey, Loon!
- Mr Looney to you!
I'm owed change.
Nobody make a move!
He looks different.
I have peripheral vision. It's a gift.
I can see my ears.
A guy's throwing up
on the pool table on my left.
Two guys are asleep on the table
on the right. A bulb's blown overhead.
- There's a fly on the money box.
- What is this crap?
(PHONE RINGS )
- Hello.
- Hi, honey.
Don't "honey" me! Besides, I'm drunk.
Pam, you know that race?
The one you left before?
I've decided to become an alcoholic.
It's the healthiest thing I've ever done.
I won. We're pretty rich.
I'm going to drink every day,
morning, noon and night.
Bottles of gin, beer...
I'll hide the bottles around the house.
I'm never going to cook, or clean.
Or take baths.
Sell the bed if you want. Bet with it.
I'll be passing out on the floor
from now on.
Because...
I don't care about the refrigerator. Sell it.
Pam, all of the money
is in a green box. I haven't spent any.
- Pam?
- I'm drinking and flicking ash around.
I couldn't leave you.
I decided this is the only way.
- Pam...
<i>- Go make your bet.</i>
Call me when you like. I'll be here...
Passed out in a pool of vomit.
- I think we have to talk.
- You can move back.
- I missed you all the time.
- Oh, Pam.
- I really love you.
- Well, that's...
...very sweet.
<i>Pamela?</i>
Sorry, I dropped the phone. Could you
pick up some wine? I love you.
Do you mean that?
Of course I do.
Mean what?
- Honey?
- Yeah?
What do you want to do
with the box of assets?
Honey, I'm home. Pam?
Pammy?
I didn't bet.
We're rich.
I got you a little bubbly.
And I got you a nice little gift here.
Huh? Eh?
Honey?
Sweetie honey?
OK.
Ah!
$69,000!

Nine...piles of tiles?
What does that mean?

by a Chinese jockey.
- In the first race.
- They raced horses for generations.

(EVERYONE CHEERS )
I knew it! I knew it!
I knew it.

Now, that's a man!
All these bums here said
you were nothing but a quitter.
- But I defended you.
- Yeah!
A toast!
To Trotter!
You're all great friends.
And who needs money
when you got friends?
Don't worry, because we'll all be here
to pick you up when it's over!
- I got an idea.
- You got a horse picked out?
- I'm hot, right?
- (ALL) Yeah!
I am truly hot!
And there is nothing more important
than friendship.
- Nothing!
- Here's what we're going to do.
We're going to take everything we've got.
Everything I've got!
- And everything you've got!
- Yeah!
- Every last cent!
- Yeah!
We're going to put it all together
into one big pile.
(ALL) Yeah!
And we're going to bet it together!
- (MAN) Yeah!
- (ROOM GOES QUIET)
Looney, I'm hot!
I'm hot! Listen to me!
This is the chance
that you have all been waiting for.
Next race, I'm putting up 27 stars.
It's good, but I wouldn't bet my grandma.
- I wouldn't bet mine, either.
- You don't understand.
- Sashay Around!
- Chocaholic!
What's the name of that six horse?
Let me see the jockey's name.
There's something about the sound.
Diamondback. I don't know what it is.
<i>(PA) Trainer Tony Kelly</i>

(BUCKET RATTLES )
Guess who?
- A football salesman?
- No, it's me, Vicki.
- Hi, Vicki.
- Hi, Trotter.
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing. What are you going to do?
- I don't know. Where's your friend?
- Who, Bernie?
You can do better than that.
A girl's got to decide what's important,
money or love.
No one's giving anything away.
And Bernie's rich,
which can be handy.
You're a wonderful girl.
Thank you, Trotter!
I'm getting a little nervous now.
I was thinking I'd come down
and ask you to go to bed with me,
'cause I think you're kind of funny,
that's all.
Am I having a good day, or what?
- Vicki.
- What?
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
From the bottom of my heart, thank you.
But I love my wife.
Oh...
I just thought I'd ask, that's all.
What is it they say?
Nothing ventured, nothing...ventured.
Hey, Trotter.
Hi.
- What are you going to do?
- I know what he's not going to do.
- What are you going to do?
- I don't know.
- Are you going to bet on this race?
- I don't know.
(HORSE WHINNIES )
- Whatever you do, don't bet on that!
- Why not?
There's something wrong with its eyes.
It's blind. How can they put it in a race?
Let me get this straight,
whatever I do, don't bet this horse?
- Looney, Vicki.
- Nice to meet you.
Oh!
I may faint. Don't worry.
We got full medical coverage. I'll be OK.
- Let it ride.
- Is it all in there?
I spent some on the little woman,
but basically, yeah, it's all there.
- There are all kinds of balls.
- One of his is crystal!
I can't give you $50 win tickets.
That's over 1,300 tickets.
It'll jam the machine.
We'll be here till Christmas!
The counting room!
2,000...
(SOBBING )
Right, I will now issue you with a receipt
to the value of your wager, $68,000,
on the number two horse,
which is called Hot-To-Trot.
- Should you lose this receipt...
- He won't lose it.
Your bet will go through the computer
that adjusts the Tote board odds.
Hot-To-Trot's sitting at 40-1.
A wager this size
is going to knock it down to maybe 8-1.
You're calm. Most guys come in here
are ready to gnaw the legs off the tables!
That's 'cause I'm going to win.
You're a wonderful guy!
What a guy!
- Some coke dealer went nuts again.
- Heavy better, make room!
- Who do you like, Evangeline?
- I'm betting all of my $200
on the four horse, Stargazer, to show.
Of course, I could lose. What if I lost?
- It's too late!
- Come on, Trotter! It doesn't matter.
All right. I had lobster, a few drinks.
Bought my wife a diamond necklace.
I'm OK.
I settled Looney's tab. Made friends,
like you and Vicki, the ticket seller.
You can't put a price on a day
like that, can you?
That's money for a ride home,
and dinner out somewhere, if I lose.
- But if I win, Reardon, if I win... !
- That is him!
(ECSTATIC CHEERING )
- I was getting worried about you.
- I bet 20 on the favourite.
I put every penny
on the number two horse, Hot-To-Trot.
You know, when the odds went to 8-1,
I knew it! He pissed it all away!
- May the best horse win!
- The two!
- I think the two horse was limping!
- Shut up or die, you pessimistic jinx!
I can't see!
- Run, you son of a bitch!
- Come on, Hot-To-Trot!
- I swear I'll stop!
- I always swear I'll quit smoking.
- I don't think so.
- I bet you swore something secretly.
Who do you think you are,
Jimmy Swaggart? This is a horse race!
- It just doesn't work that way!
- If my horse loses, I'll wring your neck!
I can't see the two horse!
- What do you see?
- Your horse is on the outside.
- Stay on the track!
- It can't hear!
(VICKl) Stay on the damn track!
Come on, Stargazer, move it!
Keep it out of the money!
I'll give up all my smut!
Two horses pulled away,
and one's yours!
More ground to cover!
I'll leave Bernie. Pure love from now on.
I'll go for some poor guy with nothing.
Let him have it.
I don't care about the lousy $200.
Marry me?
<i>(PA) They've got three eighths</i>
<i>of a mile left to go...</i>
<i>It's Stargazer...</i>
Ah! Aah!
- They're pecker to pecker!
- Who?
<i>- Stargazer on the inside...</i>
- Come on! Please!
You can't shine a torch between them!
<i>It's Stargazer on the outside...</i>
- I'm getting something.

<i>My God!</i>
Which was My God?
Thank God I'm poor and don't have
to worry about finishes like that!
I knew it! I knew it!
- What the hell did he know?
- We knew it.
Wouldn't it be hell if it gets disqualified?
Looney!
I knew it!
Sorry. Excuse me.
Thanks. That was really sweet, honey.
This!
I bet it all, honey. I let it all ride.
It's only money.
- Let the guy have it, OK? He's sweet.
<i>- The winner of the tenth race,</i>

Why are they cheering?
Because they're having
a very good day.
<i># I got the horse right here</i>
<i>The name is Paul Revere</i>
<i># And here's a guy that says</i>

<i># Can do, can do</i>
<i># This guy says the horse can do</i>
<i># I'm pickin' Valentine</i>
<i>'cause on the "Morning Line"</i>
<i># A guy has got him figured</i>
<i>at five to nine</i>
<i># So make it Epitaph</i>
<i>he wins it by a half</i>
<i># According to this here</i>

<i># And just a minute, boys</i>
<i>I've got the feed box noise</i>
<i># It says the great grandfather</i>
<i>was Equipoise</i>
<i># I tell you Paul Revere</i>
<i>and this is no bum steer</i>
<i># It's from a handicapper</i>
<i>that's real sincere</i>
<i># But look at Epitaph</i>
<i>he wins it by a half</i>
<i># According to this here</i>

<i># There's a perfect time</i>
<i>when you're tempting fate</i>
<i># And you lay your money down</i>
<i># When you cross the line</i>
<i>to another place</i>
<i># Comes a time when you got to</i>
<i>Let it ride</i>
<i># Mm... Oh, yeah</i>
<i># A victim of circumstance</i>
<i>or a master of fate</i>
<i># When it comes to taking a chance</i>
<i>it's never too late</i>
<i># Hearts on fire</i>
<i>You got to make it through</i>
<i># And at the wire</i>
<i>you win or lose</i>
<i># There's a perfect time</i>
<i>when you're tempting fate</i>
<i># And you lay your money down</i>
<i># When you cross the line</i>
<i>to another place</i>
<i># Comes a time when you got to</i>
<i>Let it ride</i>
<i># Mm... Oh, yeah #</i>
<i># You can take me to the cleaners</i>
<i>where I lay my money down</i>
<i># You can take me to the races again</i>
<i># These are hard times</i>
<i>for a betting man</i>
<i># This is just your thing</i>
<i># You better listen when the voice</i>
<i>inside your head begins to call</i>
<i># 'Cause money talks</i>
<i>Mm... Money talks</i>
<i># And when you're standing around</i>
<i>keep your feet upon the ground</i>
<i># Money talks</i>
<i>Mm... Money talks</i>
<i># Mm... Money talks</i>
<i># Money talks</i>
<i># Well, there's a fine line between</i>
<i>reality and a vision in a dream</i>
<i># Ooh, which one is the truth</i>
<i># If the hard life of the other half</i>
<i>can't see what it means</i>
<i># You better listen when the man</i>
<i>inside your heart begins to call</i>
<i># 'Cause money talks</i>
<i># Mm... Money talks</i>
<i># As it all comes crashing down</i>
<i>You keep your feet upon the ground</i>
<i># 'Cause money talks #</i>
