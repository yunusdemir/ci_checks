Hey, you're kind of cute.
Maybe we should take this highway.
Yeah, see, if we stay on this highway...
Well, look, there's a bad apple
in every barrel, right?
- Got the burgers, right?
- Yeah.
Paul, BB sad, sad.
- Hey, BB, ready to get going there, boy?
- Oh, yes.
Okay.
Ready to go.
What the hell was that?
How are you doing there, BB?
Having fun?
Look, we're lost.
We passed it.
Mom, we still got 12 miles left.
Look, you gotta trust
your navigator, okay?
How can you trust a navigator
who hasn't looked up in 10 minutes?
Because I can see the odometer
right there. Hey, turn here.
That was 856.
The next one must be it, then.
- Hey, BB we're here.
- I know.
Oh, it's so pretty.
God, it looks good.
868 Merkle.
This is it.
Goddamn it. Where the hell did she put
that bottle of mine, that little bitch?
Come on, guys.
Come here, BB.
Okay, BB.
Let's go.
Come on. Out of the van.
Got a whole new world
for you to learn.
Be careful.
What do you think?
Are you all right?
What the hell is that?
- Oh, his name is BB. Are you all right?
- BB.
Yeah, sure.
Is he for real?
Where did you get him?
I made him.
What's your name?
- Tom.
- BB, this is Tom.
Come on, it's okay.
I can't believe this.
That is incredible. Hey.
What, is he programmed to do that?
I developed the basic program.
Then he sort of makes up his own mind
after that.
Do you know anything
about artificial intelligence?
This is his brain.
It's not like ours, but it plans and thinks.
He's always learning.
He's full of surprises.
I'm constantly upgrading him,
so you never know what he's gonna do.
Hey, maybe I'll see you in school.
Are you in the 10th grade?
Oh, not really.
I'm on a scholarship at Polytech.
Studying the human brain.
It's one of the best medical schools.
Well.
Whatever.
So long, BB.
Bye.
Be back.
So, what do you think?
First thing we need to do is build a ramp
so BB can get up those stairs by himself.
From Dr. Johanson.
What's he up to?
I need to recharge his batteries.
It was a long trip.
I told him to charge before we left.
Hi, fellas.
- Dr. Johanson. Over here.
- Paul.
- Hello.
- How are you?
- Welcome to Polytech.
- Thanks. Mom.
- Jeannie.
- Hi, doctor.
- It's good to see you.
- You too.
BB, come and say hello.
Look at this. He's amazing.
Smarter than I am,
he brought an umbrella.
He keeps getting smarter too.
Come on,
I've got something to show you.
This is it, Paul.
Your brand new lab, all ready to go.
And we've installed
a tie-in to the mainframe.
So you'll have as much computer power
as you could possibly want.
Chancellor Bruckner says that position
in his office is still waiting.
My knuckles are raw
from knocking on wood.
Well, it's out-and-out bribery.
You don't think I'd let a kid like this
get away, do you?
Hello there.
- What's your name?
- BB. How about you?
Anybody there?
- Who's doing this?
- BB.
BB.
Hi.
Hi.
He's mine.
No one's running him.
He's doing it himself.
BB.
He's pretty smart.
You can tell, he likes you.
He's cute.
My name is Sam.
Samantha, you know.
What's yours?
Paul.
It's nice to meet you.
Do you like your new house?
Sort of. It's all right.
Maybe I'll come over sometime.
Sure.
You can even come over now.
No, I can't. Not right now.
I'm sorry.
But I really gotta go.
Well, if now's not convenient for you,
how about when you're done?
I'll see. Maybe later.
Which direction for the first customer?
- Over there.
- BB.
What do you do when you're done
with your paper route?
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- No, the girls around here, you know...
...are kind of stuck-up.
It's tough.
What do you know about the people
living next door to me?
- Sam?
- Yeah.
Great tits.
You're telling me.
Forget it, though.
Her father will kill you
if you get within 10 feet.
- Her father?
- Yeah. He's a crazy man.
Speaking of crazy, welcome
to Elvira Parker's fortress.
I like to think of it as a bomb.
One day I'm gonna crack
this combination...
...walk up and hand her the paper.
Probably scare her to death,
she's so paranoid.
BB could crack that lock in a minute.
You're kidding.
Why would I be kidding? BB's smart.
Who's out there?
What are you doing?
Oh, it's just me, Mrs. Parker.
- What is that?
- BB.
You get that thing away from my gate.
I'm warning you.
Jesus.
She's waved that at me
a million times.
It's just a robot, Mrs. Parker.
He's your new neighbor.
You get that out of here
or I'll blow your heads off.
Okay, we're going. We're going.
Remember
I have to collect tomorrow.
That must be fun.
A blast.
What does your dad do?
He's a security guard over
at the university hospital.
It's not bad.
He's got keys to everything.
The university gym, weight room.
Sometimes we use the pool late at night.
Do you like diving?
We got a great team on the board.
That sounds fun.
- Yo, lick.
- Shit.
Here comes Carl and his goon squad.
Stop here.
What the hell is this?
Hey, come here.
- Look at this thing.
- Don't do that.
Who's gonna stop me?
Hey, does anybody got a can opener?
- Hey.
- All right.
- Don't.
- Get out of my face.
Hey, be careful. He'll hurt you.
Who? This garbage can?
Careful.
He can crush you if he wants.
He has three multivalve compressors.
- Tell your friends to leave.
- Yeah.
- Leave. Leave.
- Leave.
Get away.
Get on your bikes now.
Get on your bikes. Now.
Okay. Okay, let go, man.
Okay, BB, let go.
I'll get you.
BB did good.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I thought I'd come by.
If you're busy or still eating,
I can come back.
We're done.
Come on in.
I wanted to bake you something...
...but I couldn't.
I just brought these.
Oh, I love these.
I love them.
Thank you. Come on in.
- Come on in.
- Paul, who is it?
It's just Sam from next door.
Everything is pretty much a mess still.
This is like the science lab at school.
You're the first girl
I ever had in my room.
I bet you tell all the girls that.
Wow, what's up here?
Oh, it's just the attic.
- Hello?
- Hello.
I'm looking for my daughter.
I'm from next door.
Did she come here?
Oh, no.
It's all right.
We were studying.
We were just studying.
You didn't say anything about going out.
You were sleeping.
I didn't think you'd mind.
Why don't you tell these people
you're sorry for bothering them?
- Oh, but she wasn't...
- I'm sorry.
Hey, this won't happen again.
- Dad, I told you I was studying.
- Just studying, huh?
- Don't, that hurts.
- Too bad.
You probably told them
all sorts of lies, didn't you?
About me. Just like your mother.
I didn't even talk about you, Daddy.
I just saw the house, met his mother.
Just met his mother?
What? You been fooling around
with him?
Your mother would be proud.
Just like her.
I don't want you here.
Don't touch me.
I'll touch you anytime I like.
You little bitch. I'm your father.
- You do what I tell you.
- Oh, Dad, stop it!
You can't hurt me
because Daddy don't wanna be hurt.
You can't stop me.
He can't stop me.
And that little stupid yellow robot
can't stop me.
No, stop it.
Daddy, stop it.
Now, this is the cross-coupled
sentry-control hierarchy...
...that worked best for BB's early brain.
Links from right to left provide
context and expectations...
...processing sensory data.
You can see the type
of feedback information...
...provided to the task-seek
composition hierarchy at each level.
Of course,
we're a lot further along now.
We're pretty close to approaching
the way a normal human brain works.
I got it.
Bring it over here.
BB should take a shot, huh?
- Want to? Want to take a shot, BB?
- BB, ball.
- All right.
- Good.
Let's go. Let's see it.
- Oh, boy.
- We gotta get it.
Oh, boy.
Okay, let's go.
Oh, I don't know.
- I can do it.
- No.
I'll get it.
- What the hell do you think you're doing?
- Nothing.
Hey, you can't do that.
Oh, yes I can.
My property. My house.
My ball.
What a witch!
Really the pits.
Come on, BB.
There's nothing we can do.
BB.
Let's go.
Paul, as soon as you finish that, I want
you to trace the cortical motor pathway.
I already did that.
You already did it?
It runs from the cortex to the substantia
nigra to the medulla oblongata.
Look at this.
What the hell?
How did you do that?
I hooked it up to a new circuit
I set up for BB.
And all of a sudden
it started showing animation.
Dr. Johanson tells me things
are really coming along on your project.
It's true.
He's making very nice progress.
- Want me to get that?
- No, I'll get it.
Do you have some ice?
Oh, my God.
Come on in.
Sit down.
Paul, get some ice.
Hold your head back, back.
Hurry.
- What happened?
- Nothing. I just get them sometime.
Here you go.
Listen, sweetheart, this may be
butting in where I don't belong...
...but don't you think
someone should say something?
For what, a nosebleed? Come on,
I've had them since I was a kid.
Ice will take care of it.
I just forgot to fill the tray.
- Oh, Sam, I don't like this.
- I hate them.
Come on, you know what I mean.
It's criminal.
He could go to jail.
He's my father.
Sometimes I wanna roll a truck
over his face, but he's still my father.
Hey, you little creeps, cut that out.
Hey, come on. Let's get out of here.
Come on, I got a great idea
for the next place.
We can't go in there.
Who's stopping us?
Hey, BB.
BB, come here.
BB, come on. Come on, boy.
- Come here.
- No, he can't open that.
- What do you mean? You said he could.
- Yeah, he can, but he's not going to.
Oh, come on, Paul.
I mean, imagine her face
when she hears the doorbell.
There hasn't been a kid closer
to this fence in years.
No.
She wouldn't even know who it is.
It's Halloween.
Trick or treat.
Yeah.
Go ahead.
What's he doing?
He's trying every possible three number
combination between one and 40.
There's about 64,000.
Look, this could take all night.
I really don't think
we should be doing this.
BB, wait. Get back here.
BB, get over here.
Right now.
Paul.
No. He's been acting way too strange.
Well, then who's gonna do it?
Any volunteers?
I'll go.
Sam, wait. Hold on just a second. Sam.
- Sam, get out!
- Come on.
Oh, God!
Are you okay?
Let's go. She's coming. Run.
Who's there?
Who's out there?
BB, no. Get back.
Get out of here.
Why the hell isn't he responding?
Get out of here.
Get back.
No! No, BB!
Oh, God!
With the diagnosis and localization
of chronic subdural hematoma...
...either by ventriculography
or by subdural puncture, let me say this.
It may be unnecessary
to complete the air injection...
Thank you, Lord,
for all the blessings in our life.
This wonderful, cozy old house
and for a car that still runs.
And for the generosity of the university
and especially Dr. Johanson.
Please bless us, Lord.
And bless Sam.
And may you keep her father dead to the
world for the rest of the night. Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Okay, let's do it. Pass the food.
Let's eat.
Looks up on the left and Ferris slips it.
Ferris tries a left hand
to the body...
- Good night, Jeannie. Thanks a lot.
- Good night, Sam.
Good night.
Good night.
Daddy?
Daddy?
Are you in my room?
Where have you been?
I was studying, Daddy.
I had homework.
You lying little bitch!
Okay, come on now.
None of this shit.
You get the hell up.
Samantha.
I'm not joking. You wanna know
what real trouble is?
I mean it.
You get the hell up and get in your room.
Watch that step.
- Easy, now.
- Sam?
What's happened to her?
Goddamn kid. I told her
to clean up her stuff off the stairs.
- She never would've tripped.
- Oh, my God.
- Ready?
- Ready.
Come on. Get in the car.
Show any signs of stabilizing yet?
No, look. If anything, it's gotten worse.
If we can't stop the hemorrhaging
we're gonna lose her.
- Dr. Greenberg's on his way.
- Fine.
- Microforceps.
- Microforceps.
- Cottonoid.
- Cottonoid.
That was some fall.
Looks like more than a fall to me.
What's the reading on the EEG?
- Flatline.
- There sure ain't nothing on the brain.
No vitals.
Close her up.
God, she's such a pretty kid.
Suture.
Is she alive?
We have her on life support.
We'll maintain her for the next 24 hours
for further readings...
...but I'm afraid that's just a formality.
Her brain is dead, Paul.
I'm sorry.
There was nothing we could do.
What do you mean, there's nothing
you could do?
We have experimental things, a whole
battery of things. You can't let her die.
Paul, there was nothing we
or anybody else could do.
Paul.
Paul.
Tom.
Tom. Hey, wake up.
Paul.
What are you doing here?
I need a favor.
A big one.
What's up?
I need you to stay at my house tonight.
Your house? What are you talking about?
Do you know what time it is?
And I need your dad's keys,
just for the night.
Are you kidding?
- Do you know what he'd do to me?
- He won't find out.
What's this all about?
We're gonna save Sam.
Sam?
What do you mean, save Sam?
She's dead.
No, she isn't. Not yet.
We're gonna go to the hospital and get
her out before they pull the plug at 10.
- No, we're not.
- Hey, you owe me, Tom.
- No way.
- You owe me.
It's because of you BB got killed.
You said so yourself.
Paul.
Save Sam?
How do you figure on doing that?
Are you out of your fucking mind?
Are you two through?
- Yeah.
- It was great.
Now, how about some pie?
Oh, no.
And some coffee for me.
Pie and coffee. Yes, sir.
Boy, that sounds good.
Whipped cream?
Yes.
Thanks.
Boy, I make good coffee.
Are you okay?
Yeah, just something in my throat.
You look tired.
Maybe you should just go to bed.
No.
I'm wide awake.
I keep thinking about the hospital.
Thinking we should be there.
What could we do?
Just sit.
Well, I know.
But it just feels so strange.
- Nine o'clock will come and...
- Nine?
You mean 10.
No, nine.
They changed it to nine.
Something to do with the coroner.
Less than an hour.
Boy, I need some more coffee.
- Hey. Hey, is she gonna be okay?
- Just shut up and get in the van.
We're never gonna make it in time.
Will you quit saying that?
We're gonna make it.
- You got the windshield wipers on.
- I know.
Hey, wait. Wait a minute.
I'm trying to put on my seatbelt.
- Where's first?
- Up and left.
- What was that?
- Jesus, take it easy.
Boy, what a ride.
Hey, where did you learn
how to drive, huh?
- Between the house and here.
- What?
Lts BB's battery for the respirator.
Hang on to it.
You got the keys?
Yeah, I got them.
Mother drugging, car theft, reckless
driving without a license, illegal trespass.
- We'll be old when we get out.
- Will you shut up and open the door?
Over here.
- How did you know this would be here?
- I put it here earlier. Let's go.
Here are the directions.
At 8:59, you're gonna throw the
switches. Don't worry, I checked it out.
There are backup generators.
Nobody will get hurt.
I just need a diversion, all right?
Then what?
I don't know.
What do you mean, you don't know?
Look, we're an hour late.
I'm doing the best I can, all right?
Okay, it's 8:55.
Give me four... Are you listening?
Give me four minutes,
then throw this switch, okay?
Tom, just do as I tell you.
It'll be a piece of cake, okay?
Why don't I believe you?
So, what can I do? She said
she wanted the house and the car.
Come on. Come on.
It's not 9:00 yet.
We should just do it.
What a waste.
- Okay, let's gather up the equipment.
- Let's go.
Easy, Tom.
Don't blow it.
There's a message.
Check the pressure on number five.
Shit. Shit. Shit, Tom.
Your attention, please.
We have experienced a temporary
interruption in electrical power.
Central services are now being handled
by our backup system...
...while maintenance
is working to restore power.
The staff will limit its use
of all nonessential electrical services.
You really got her.
Where's all her stuff?
- Where's her life support?
- We were too late.
Too late? What do you mean too late?
What's she doing here?
- They pulled the plug.
- She's dead?
Hey, she's dead?
Hey. What the hell are you doing? You
didn't say anything about a dead body.
- We're supposed to save her.
- We're gonna try.
Try? Are you crazy or something?
Are you crazy?
What's the matter with you?
What did you want me to do,
leave her there?
Goddamn it.
There's still a chance.
Things we can do.
We've gotta go now. Sit down.
I want out. I mean it,
I'm gonna throw up.
Throw up later.
Hey, slow down.
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?
How do you think I built BB?
I studied brain physiology and cognitive
theory till it's coming out of my ears.
I have ideas no one ever thought of.
I'll buy that.
This is it.
Wanna see?
Perfect.
What is that?
It's BB's brain. Or it was BB's brain.
I've doctored it up a bit.
You're giving her a robot brain?
I'm giving her a computer.
It's a battery powered,
self-contained computer.
You know what a pacemaker
is for the heart, right?
Well, this is like that
only it's for the head.
If there's any life left at all in her brain,
this will find it.
We'll reroute it around
the damaged portion...
...and join it all together
as a whole again.
Now what?
Now we see if it works.
You're kidding.
You're kidding, right?
Are you ready?
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Paul. Paul. There's no heartbeat.
She's ice cold.
Did you see that?
See what?
Her toe. It moved.
- It's just your mind.
- No. It moved.
No, look, Paul. I was standing
right there. Nothing is happening.
Sam.
Tom.
Hey, you okay?
What was that?
I don't know.
- I'll go ahead first.
- All right.
Okay.
- Gentle, gentle.
- I know. I know.
Okay.
- Go the other way.
- What?
Other way.
I'll see you in the house.
You don't wanna go in there.
- What do you mean?
- I think you killed her.
- What are you talking about?
- I had a feeling you put too much in.
It was all measured.
Mom?
Oh, God.
Mom?
Mom.
- Oh, God. Mom.
- What? What?
What time is it?
It's about 7:30.
Did I sleep here all night?
Yeah, I think you did.
I never do that.
I can't believe I did that.
What have you two been up to?
Nothing much.
We've just been fooling around.
Yeah, yeah. Just fooling around.
I gotta go wash my face.
I really don't know what to say.
I really appreciate everything
you've done.
You really made it up to me.
You're a true friend.
We're even now, right?
Oh, of course.
Okay.
Hey, remember...
...it's just between you and me, right?
All right.
See you around, okay?
You're breathing.
It's okay.
Okay, we got time. This one's it.
You got it this time.
All right?
Feel that? Feel that?
Just hold it.
One more time and you got it.
There you are.
Just hold it.
Comfortable?
Okay, I'm letting go.
Okay.
That's wonderful.
That's wonderful.
- Has anybody talked to her father?
- Relax. Just got here ourselves. Wait.
What's the official word?
Did she walk away?
Can I get a picture?
Sam.
How in the hell did you get up?
How did you stand?
What's going on?
Sit down.
Paul.
Paul Conway,
you get out here this instant.
What the hell's this all about?
What's going on around here, huh?
What is this doing out here?
I buy you a $200 down sleeping bag...
...and I find it trashed in the middle
of the backyard.
What's going on, huh?
I had to try it out.
Look, when IBM is paying you
a hundred thou a year...
...you can buy as many sleeping bags
as you want.
But as long as I'm supporting us,
you show some respect. Understand?
Okay.
Who is it?
Who's there?
Sam?
You're supposed to be dead.
My God.
Get away from me.
Sam.
Sam, it was an accident.
I didn't mean to do it.
Mr. Pringle?
Oh, God.
I gotta leave you here for now, Sam.
I can't put you back in the tool shed.
I can't trust you.
I'll be back for you later, okay?
I just need time to think.
I just need to figure it out.
Oh, I've got the prettiest mother.
I've got the nicest mother.
That's what I tell everybody.
I say I've got the sweetest mother
in the world.
If she wants a little boy that bad...
...why doesn 't she take one
out of the orphan 's home?
Rhoda, get away from me.
Don 't talk to me.
- We have nothing to say to each other.
- Okay, Mother.
Okay.
Rhoda.
When we lived in Wichita, Rhoda...
...there was an old lady who lived
upstairs, Mrs. Carson. She liked you.
- Yes.
- Every afternoon you'd go upstairs...
...and visit her and she used to
show you all her treasures.
And the one that you admired most
was a crystal ball and candlestick holder.
Operator, quick.
Get me the police.
- Yeah?
- Sarge, its Elvira Parker.
Again?
- What is it with that woman?
- She said it's urgent.
And she said she's seen the dead girl
walk around the house across the street.
God, that woman is crazy.
Can you believe that shit?
Okay. Tell her I'll get out there
as soon as it's humanly possible.
You can sleep on it
when you're supposed to be working.
- Idiots.
- You ain 't no dope, that I must say.
That's why you didn 't leave that stick
around where nobody could find it.
Oh, no.
You got better sense than that.
You took that bloody stick.
And you washed it off real good.
You threw it in the woods
where nobody could find it.
You know, I think
you're a very silly man.
It was you who was silly, thinking you
could wash off blood and you can 't.
- Why can 't you wash off blood?
- Because you can 't.
And the police know it.
You can wash and you can wash,
yet there's always some left.
Everybody knows that.
I'm gonna call the police...
...and I'm gonna tell them to start
looking for that stick in the woods.
They got what they call "stick
bloodhounds" to help them look.
And them stick bloodhounds
can find any stick there is...
...that's got blood on it.
When they bring in that stick
you wash off, the police...
...are gonna sprinkle some special...
You beat it out of my house.
I've got my shotgun.
You little shits.
Scumbag.
Vermin.
I'll teach you.
I'm calling the police.
Damn kids.
How did you...?
What are you do...?
What are you doing here?
Who's down there?
It's just me, Mom.
I'm going to eat something.
Don't you move.
What are you doing?
I dropped a glass.
I was starving.
Here. Let me help you clean up.
No, that's all right. I can do it.
Really, Mom, I can do it.
I'm sorry about waking you up.
Go back to bed.
I love you, mom.
Well, that was worth waking up for.
Look, I'm sorry if I've been
a little out of sorts.
It's been rough on all of us.
Okay.
I'm going back up.
- Okay.
- Don't eat too much.
It'll give you nightmares.
Sam, you have to stay here now.
There's no place else to put you.
Sit down.
There you go.
I don't want you to go anywhere.
Understand?
I'll go downstairs
and get you some bedding.
You still sleep, don't you?
Oh, God, Sam.
God, what the hell happened
to her head?
Back it up.
Put her to one side, guys.
There's another body across the street.
- Coming through.
- Stand back, please.
- Ladies, please. No comment.
- Can we get the camera in here?
We'll get some pictures
and get out of your way, okay?
Bring that stuff over here, will you?
Put it right along the curb here.
Old man Pringle and Mrs. Parker.
Both dead.
His face was burned off.
Elvira Parker?
Yeah, I heard somebody say
she called the police.
Said she saw Sam
in her bedroom window.
From what I hear, Elvira's head
is all over the walls in there.
Are you all right?
Come on, buddy.
Paul?
Paul? Is that you?
Hey, Mom?
I'm home.
There you are.
I would have sworn
I heard you up in your room.
Did you get the bread?
Oh, your bread.
No, I forgot that.
I'm sorry.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Don't you ever listen?
What are you doing down here?
Sam.
Paul. Telephone.
I'll be down in a minute.
It sounds important. It's Tom.
I'm coming.
Don't you move.
I'll be back in a second, okay?
I'm coming right back.
I'm gonna tell, Paul.
I can 't keep this a secret anymore.
I can't.
Its eating me up alive.
She's killing people.
Look, we gotta talk. Not on the phone,
though. After school tomorrow.
- There's nothing else to talk about.
- Tom.
Come on. Don't do this.
What's happening is too important.
Tom, come on.
Just give me a chance to explain.
Just a half an hour.
For our friendship.
Understand?
Jeannie.
Dr. Johanson.
Just checking in.
Wanted to know how Paul was doing.
What do you mean?
I haven't seen him for days.
What?
I figured he must be sick.
Sick?
He's been here every day.
I drove him this morning.
Hey, what happened here?
Just come on up.
Sam?
Sam?
Sam?
Oh, shit.
There you are.
Hey, Sam, it's just me.
Look who came to visit you.
Do you know who this is?
Sure you do.
Come on over here.
There you go.
There you go.
Come on over here.
Go on, you two know each other.
There we are.
No way.
Tom.
- Tom, please.
- No way.
I'm calling the cops.
Damn you, Tom.
You said you'd give it a chance.
Hey, come on.
Hey.
- Damn you.
- Shut up.
You creep. You...
Oh, God.
Tom, I'm sorry.
You and I are gonna have a talk.
- Oh, my God, what happened?
- He's okay. He's okay.
No. You've got a crazy man for a son.
And I'm calling the cops.
You know what I'm talking about.
- Tom, you don't know what you're doing.
- You don't know what you've done.
This is gonna stop.
And I'm gonna stop you.
Sam.
What the hell are you doing?
Are you trying to kill him? Huh?
BB.
Sam.
Sam.
What do you know?
Where you going, punk?
Where you going?
Punk?
Would you believe the luck?
- Oh, no, you don't.
- Let me go.
I waited a long time for this.
Where's your little friend now, huh,
shit face?
Where's little BB now?
He's not here, is he?
He's all blown up.
Son of a...
Get off of me.
Come here! Get over there!
BB.
BB.
What the...?
Sam?
Sam?
Hey, girl.
I thought you...
Okay, freeze, miss.
Stay right where you are.
Sam, no.
BB.
Stay there.
- You don't wanna see this.
- Sam.
Sam, stop.
- She must've thrown him 30 feet.
- Mrs. Conway, get back in the car.
Sam, stop!
Hey. Look out. Are you crazy?
- Sam.
- Okay, miss, hold it right there.
Come on, hold it.
Take it easy.
Stay away from her.
Sam.
Sam.
Sam?
Sam.
Listen to me.
We can get help.
Do you know Dr. Johanson?
He can help us.
Sam, please.
Paul.
Get away from her, Paul.
No. She doesn't understand.
Hold it, miss, right there.
All right, miss, just keep calm.
Freeze.
Stop.
Get away, Paul.
Take it easy, now.
No.
No.
Don't move, Sam.
Don't move, Sam.
Please, don't do anything crazy.
Paul.
Paul.
Sam.
Put your hands above your head.
It's over.
Oh, God. No.
Stop.
No.
Paul.
Hey, radio for an ambulance.
All right, you wanna keep back there?
Step over here, all of you. Thank you.
Just keep back.
We'll do a postmortem at 7 a.m.
Do you wanna be here?
I'll be here.
It should be interesting.
One for the books.
Okay, Sam, we're gonna get you
out of here.
Paul, come with me, Paul.
No!
BB.
