How many goals can he choose? - The Saudis, he does allow.
but Heathrow will be difficult. How did it go last night?
Quarter Base thinks she Arabs who escaped have captured.
They meet this afternoon with the ISI. Hopefully they raided up.

29 MAY 2004 KHOBAR, SAUDI ARABIA
An attack against Westerners and foreigners.
If at the end of the attack watch you see.
that non-Muslims and Americans are slain.
Do not worry about the Saudis. Die arrange things well.
Now.
You warned them, they took you seriously.
and this happens. It's not your cup of tea.

You had a few days with an enemy who did not answer.
Look ahead. London, Heathrow. Many victims. Their plan still works.
Ammar has no idea what happened. - He knows.
What? - You must be very careful.
with people of the KSM circles. They are devious.
He will not talk about attacks in his homeland.
He will withhold details about the KSM network.
and probably about bin Laden.
But he is in utter seclusion.
He does not know whether we have failed. We can make him believe anything.
Bluffing?
He has not slept. He has no idea.
You do not remember, do you?
Loss of short term memory is a side effect of sleep deprivation.
It should therefore come back.
I do not know. How can I remember?
Once we have kept you awake 96 hours, you told us the names of your brothers.
and you helped make many lives innocent people to save.
That's smart. You start thinking for themselves.
Eat that. What humus, tabbouleh.
I do not know what that is. What figs. You earned it.
You flew to Amman to Kabul?
And you visited your uncle.
Mokhtar. Mokhtar¡C
How did you know? - I told you I know you.
You got me.
The passenger list.
It must have been quite shitty for you after 9/11.
What have you done after the invasion?
Before you went back to Pesh?
After 9/11 we had to choose.
Fighting for our region to protect, or to flee.
And you chose to fight.
We wanted to murder Americans.
We tried to Tora Bora to come in, but there was too much bombed.
We could not risk it.
Who are "we"?
I and some other guys who were.
I can still go with another boy eating again and you hang from the ceiling.
Hamza Rabia. Hamza Rabia¡C
Khaled el-Masri.
And Abu Ahmed.
Who are Abu Ahmed and those other guys?
He was then a computer guy with us.
After Tora Bora, I went back to Pesh, as you know.
And they came to me to the north. To Ghoryan.
What's his name? - Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti.
Ahmed Abu means "father of Ahmed '. That's Kunya.
I know the difference between a war name and an Arabic name.
There she got you, buddy.
I swear I do not know his last name.
Something I had never asked him. So did my uncle.
I know.
My uncle told me that he Bin Laden worked.
I've seen him once. One year ago in Karachi.
He read us a letter from the Shah.
A letter? - What was in there?
Cigarette?
It said: Continue the Jihad.
The work we continue another 100 years.
You and I are talking about the boys in training camp.
A pair of brothers who have done bad things.
I want them isolation of people like you.
course, yes. - A man called Abu Ahmed.
Kuwait. - I remember him.
a nice man.
What was his relationship with the leaders? - I do not know.
Was he with you, the good or just the leaders.
I do not know. I have no idea.
You do not have any idea about it.
When you Khalid Sheikh Mohammed had met, this was when one of the locations?
Is this Abu Ahmed?
KSM? Your boss?
Mukhtar Potato, you say potato. KSM I say, you say Muhktar.
After Mokhtar was captured, what did Ahmed then do?
I think he works for the sheik.
in Karachi in 2003 or 2004.
He had a letter from bin Laden with him?
name.
Who knows who directly for bin Laden is.
Let's say he part of the mix.
Were there other people letters brought about bin Laden?
Sure.
How many people?
Let's talk about them.
What's the needle in the haystack? - Good.
The only thing in life you can count on, is that everyone wants money.
You assume that Al Qaeda members motivated by financial rewards?
The radicals. - That's right.
You take that greed is not top ideology goes to the weaker members.
You need money in a cold war, I tell you.
Thank you.
CIA unnamed LOCATION GDANSK, POLAND
He says he looks at Abu Ahmed.
Who did he work?
He was usually at Faraj.
They were always together. - What did he Faraj?
He spent posts by Faraj to bin Laden. And bin Laden back Faraj.
We need to ask to see if he is telling the truth.
We do not know whether he really Faraj has known.
He just told me the names of the children of Faraj.
I think he's telling the truth.
20 Prisoners recognize that picture Abu Ahmed.
They say he is part of a circle who hung around in Afghanistan before 9/11.
A lot say that after 9/11 KSM he went to work.
When KSM was captured he Abu Faraj work.
Mainly courier of Faraj to bin Laden.
We do not know whether Abu outside the network operates.
Or he is a spy, or that he direct link to bin Laden.
Invites bin Laden him in the living room out, and gives him a personal letter.
or Abu is the latest in a long series couriers and everyone knows him why.
That's not what you do not know. You know his real name and you do not know where he is.
But we know that he is important.
Everyone has heard about Abu Ahmed, but nobody wants to tell me where he is.
so we suspect. - Maybe.
Prisoners can for some reason thus concealing his location.
Maybe they do not know. Abu Maybe a diversion.
and he is actually a unicorn.
The withholding fills not what you want, eh?
No.
And if you find him, you do not know if he was with bin Laden.
But we do not know what we do not know. - What does that mean?
That's guesswork.
Not a prisoner says he the big man has seen.
or messages that he delivers, right? - No.
But it's good work.
Let me know if you have information.
Preferably something to attack leads.
7 JULY 2005 LONDON
These are the remains of bus 10.
That rode on Tavistock Square at Houston Station.
There are also explosions at stations Liverpool Street and Edgware Road.
Dozens of survivors were seriously injured.
But many of the wounded also have their story.
We had just driven away by Edgeway Road.
And before I knew there was a flash of light.
I had a burning sensation in my hands. I put my hands over my face.
when I lay on the floor.
Yes, we could do nothing, when a sound or a bang.
Northern Light, one of the busiest areas in the capital is now deserted.
It is only a few meters from the road and there remains one care for the wounded.
Everywhere there are groups of Londoners on corners and ask themselves.
what happened and who did it.
Come on.
You too. Come on.
You guys from the office are crazy.
The prisoner is ready for you.
Come on.
ISI PRISON PAKISTAN
I want you to understand that I know you.
I follow and study for a long time.
I was chasing you in Lahore.
I've picked up instead of to murder you because you're not violent.
And you do not deserve to die. - Thank you.
But you have connections with Al Qaeda and I want to ask you about it.
Before you go to the following location transferred, probably Israel.
Depending on how frank you are here today.
you may remain in Pakistan. - What do you know?
I'm going to ask about your knowledge of Al Qaeda.
And your position as a major financier of the organization.
I've been condemned by Muhammad.
I do not want to be tortured again. Ask me a question and I answered him.
What can you tell me about Atiya Abdul Rahman?
He works for Zawahiri.
He's in charge of the military tactics.
Which contacts do you the name Abu Ahmed heard?
He works for and Faraj bin Laden.
He's his most trusted courier.
Why do you say that? - He has brought me many messages from him.
Where did you see him last seen and where is he now?
You'll never find him. - Why not?
Even I could not find him. He always unexpected contact me.
He's one of those who disappeared.
You know how this works?
God willing, we do not need to use.
Behave as normal as possible.
You're lucky. I have images of Faraj.
but not thank me yet, till you hear what I want to.
I want you to arrange, for your favorite topic.
Good.
Do not you see what it has to say?
You want family ties, financial networks, media sources, disappointing staff.
threats, patriotic interests foreign sales, health status.
financial resources, espionage techniques strategies recruits, something else?
No, that's it.
QUIET IN THE ENVIRONMENT
What they say is true. Sjaolin Wu Cheng and can be dangerous.
What should I tell you? Faraj, Fareej, Buzzy?
You like Bob Marley? Reggea?
Lean after you have something inflated?
No?
Like Libyan music like?
You were involved in those bombs in England?
You're the second number three that I have caught the KSM.
Can I be honest with you?
You do not fuck with me.
I'm not your friend. I'm not gonna help.
I'm gonna break.
Any questions? No?
You have not eaten for 18 hours already. We need to keep your energy level.
Are you hungry?
A lot of brothers have told us, that Abu Ahmed, bin Laden's courier was.
and he worked closely with you.
You think to Abu Khalid.
Who? - Al-Baluchi. My courier for the Shah.
So you're saying that all the other brothers it wrong?
And there is a famous Baluchi guy work for you and bin Laden.
I've never heard of? - Why would you have heard of him?
What does that Baluchi guy look like?
Great. Long white beard.
Thin. He uses a cane. ?- As Gandalf so.
Who?
When did you last see him? - A month ago.
In Karachi. But I do not know where he is now.
Sometimes I saw him once.
Then he told me where I the messages had to leave behind.
You do not give wrong answers?
You can not force me to say things that I do not know.
You know it no ordinary prison?
You decide how you're treated.
And your life is very uncomfortable until you give me the necessary information.
Where does Abu Ahmed currently?
Faraj Abu Ahmed denies that he knows.
I've used every measure we have.
If he remains silent, he will die by the pressure it puts on you.
Do not you try?
No.
Since when, no?
I wanted to tell you all that I step.
Are you okay? - Yeah, I just need 20 guys to see naked.
There will be a hundred by now. I need some time to do something normal.
Like what? - In Washington.
Dancing and watch the environment. You would have to go with me.
Yeah, you could be number two. You look exhausted itself.
I do not Abu Ahmed from DC.
They killed my monkey.
Slap crap they escaped. Do you believe that?
Sorry, Dan.
You have to be really careful now with the prisoners.
The political changes, and you do not want the last to hold the leash.
as the Oversight Committee comes.
I know. - Yes?
Watch your back when you go to Pakistan. Everyone knows you there now.

Sorry. Fucking checkpoint programs.

We do socially, do it well.
Look, I know that Abu Akhmed your child is.
but it's time to cut the umbilical cord.
No, it's not. - It is not succeeded with Faraj.
it happens. There are cells in London and Spain, the next attack plans.
I can work simultaneously.
And I think it is good that you lied.
No. Not jeopardize to protect the homeland.
Wait a minute. Why is it good? - You sound like Riley, he believes it either.
It's good, because the fact that nothing Faraj told about Abu Ahmed is very revealing.
Faraj lied only on the whereabouts of bin Laden.
That means Faraj Abu Akhmed just think.
so important to protect as bin Laden.
That confirms my lead. - Whether its source.
We're just worried about you, okay? Can I do it?
Look how upset you are.
Where's Jack? - Probably at a checkpoint somewhere.
Have you been together?
I work with him. I'm not that girl fuck that. That is improper.
Just messing around does not hurt.
So no boyfriend?
Do you have friends?
That's Jack. That's good.
Come on.
Come on.
Go. Come on over here.

THE ENCOUNTER
STRAIN FIELD NORTHERN PAKISTAN
The Jordanians have a mole. - What?
He made this video to prove that he can be trusted.
You're kidding.
Hammam Khalil al-Balawi, he is a Jordanian doctor.
He's in the middle.
I do not believe it. Did you yourself not say that nobody is against Al Qaeda?
The Jordanian worked there for years. Dinner mirrors, money, she convinced him.
it's his patriotic duty is to counter Al Qaeda again.
and so rich. - Yes, said the Jordanians also.
Yeah, you're right. We can take him or the Jordanians.
not trust. We have confront him.
He's not so smart. He can do much nonsense tell, but we must look to find.
We can at least meet him so we have yourself to find out what he could do.
Did he really asked for a car?
He'll damn thing is filled with poison.
We can not meet Balawi. They can not come to Islamabad.
Can not, or will not? - He's not traveling.
Security Risk.
I told you repeatedly not that America tortures.
And I make sure that we do not torture. That's part of the opportunity.
to America's moral prestige in the world to regain.
He wants us to come to him.
They meet us in Meydan Sjahr among the tribes.
He knows that we are kidnapped. - Can we do it somewhere else?
Germany or England.
He has a valid passport. - He will not go outside Al Qaeda field trips.
And you do not go to him. - I do not, believe me.
We're trapped.
And what did you think of Camp Chapman Afghanistan.
There it is safe.
CAMP CHAPMAN AFGHANISTAN Khost
Of this I went tack. But I made a cake for him.
not Muslims celebrate with cake.
Do not take it so literally. Everyone loves cake.
It's not too late for you to come, it would be fun.
No, I do not want to block the bone.
It's your show, you first saw the potential of this.
Come on. We have enough wine.
Nice, take a bottle with me. - I will.
No good techie.
But this guy is actually the first major breakthrough since 9/11.
On major breakthroughs and the little people they allow.
So far everything he said checked and.
And I think the money convincing enough.
25 Million dollars.
There you buy a new life.
You think he exaggerates access? - Probably.
But Al Qaeda has needed doctors, and they lack staff and.
that would explain his resurrection.
Within six months or a year.
if not he screwed up, he can be called to bin Laden betrayed.
At that time, with 25 million on the table, I think he is the big man betrayal.
And if he does not, we murder him.
If he does let me do the talking, and then give.
I give it to you and then you talking about protection.
Okay. - Lauren?
I know you want to ask questions. Give Balawi some time.
after John has spoken We talk about the standard stuff.
do birthday cake, and then the rest.

I do the introduction. You're your team. He knows that this is a high-level meeting is.
Is this site find our building?
Yes. And Lauren, Washington want realtime updates.
So please, sit on top.
Be concise. The director follows everything.
And it will not surprise me if he informs the President.
Yeah, I'm on it. - Now I have to get him here.
Why are gatekeepers there?
Here we have talked about. Nobody should be there.
as my source appears, you just probably scared.
The procedure works only if we constantly follow him.
This is different, sorry I can not explain but it's a good thing.
I'm responsible for every one that is seen. It's not just you.
They just have to jut. You can frisk him when he arrives.
All the stations.
This is Whiplash, calm place. - Meet.
Thank you.
A SECOND HE IS HERE
BEAUTIFUL
ALL YOU TALK?
Okay, he's coming.
We frisk him when he's there. - Naturally.
ANSWER IF YOU CAN

Hands out of your pockets.
Get your hands out of your pockets. Now. - Now, get your hands out of your pockets.
ANSWER IF YOU CAN
The CIA says that seven of his employees are killed and six other.
injured in a suicide attack on a base in Afghanistan.
It was one of the deadliest attacks in the history of the CIA.
The question press Abuse that the head of the CIA.
the injured part, former officials say she was mother of three children.
Are you okay? - No.
I thought it could not get worse.
But, bad news the Saudi secret service.
The courier, Abu Ahmed, is dead.
It's on video.
Is he dead?
In Afghanistan. 2001. I saw it myself.
Is he dead? - Afghanistan, 2001.
Kabul? - I do not believe this.
Sorry, Maya, I liked this informant always al
Sorry, I just got here.
What are you doing?
I'll take anyone who has to deal with.
And then I bin Laden murder.
Right.
HUMAN ERROR
I want something clear.
If you thought there was a.
secret prison for al-Qaeda works.
I want you to know that it is not.
This is it.
No one's coming to save you.
There's nobody else hidden on another floor.
Only we are there.
And we fail.
We spend millions of dollars. People are dying.
We are not closer in defeating our enemy.
They have attacked us in the country, in 1998.
By sea in 2000, and from the air in 2001.
They have 3,000 of our citizens murdered in cold blood.
And they have massacred our people. And what the hell have we done?
What do we do about it?
We have enough names of leaders, but only have four eliminated.
I want goals.
Do your damn job. Take me to murder people.
I did everything by the system let go and found this.
He is. He was one of the ten names on a list sent by the Moroccans after 9/11.
Said Ibrahim.
They said to watch him, but probably they think.
his family and relatives links with the KSM.
He was arrested for forgery, and a doctor's certificate, stating that.
He left Afghanistan, by traveling to Morocco on the way to Kuwait, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti.
This must be Abu Ahmed.
It does not matter. I wish I knew five years ago.
How come I did not see before? - No one has probably seen.
There was a lot of noise after 9/11.
Countries that wanted to help. We have a million tips, and.
things were lost in the hassle.
Human Error.
But good. I just thought you should know.
I just want to say that I've heard a lot about you.
You've inspired me to Pakistan.
Maybe I can once kebab treat
Burn it. It's too dangerous.
CIA headquarters LANGLEY, VIRGINIA
Then, Debby, Abu Ahmed found.
Really? - Yeah, he was all the time in the files
The family name is Said.
Okay, but he's dead. Then he is not more important for you?
Maybe he's not. We know that he was one of eight brothers.
All brothers alike. Three of them have gone to Afghanistan.
Is not it possible that when the three older brothers got a beard.
in Afghanistan they parted like?
I think whoever itself Abu Ahmed calls still alive.
The picture we use is wrong. That is his older brother, Habib.
He's the one who's dead.
What are you basing that on? - We have no obituary.
Abu Ahmed had.
We have only a prisoner who said he had buried someone who looked like Abu Ahmed.
But if someone as important as he is dead gone, they have it online.
And the prisoner said Habib died in 2001. We knew.
that Abu Ahmed was alive to try in Tora Bora with Ammar.
That means it's probably one of the other brothers who are dead.
In other words, you want it to be true. - Yes, I do.
Take it easy. - I am calm.
Put your request.
Move heaven and earth.
and give me the phone number of Said's family.
Okay, I'll go talk to Wolf.
I have a few hundred thousand dollars.
Four hundred up.
Where do you get that? - Of you.
You think? - Yes.
If we have a phone number, this can the breakthrough for Maya.
She's your killer wolf, you got her ejected.
Alla rewards those who strive and fight for those who sit behind a desk.
As you know, have Gitmo and Abu Graheb screwed us.
The prisoners program flypaper. We senators sit behind us.
And the director is very concerned.
that they will not stop, before they have a body.
It's my case.
I defend it.

KUWAIT CITY KUWAIT
It's good to be back in Kuwait.
It's good to see you again. It's a long time ago.
You must do me a favor.
Why are you asking me something?
Because we're friends. - You say that we are friends.
How come you only call if you need help?
But if I need anything, you're too busy to answer the phone address.
I do not think we're friends. - Okay, honestly.
How about a Lamborghini? How do you like friendship?
The dick was out of bed.
Thank you, I appreciate that.
Is this a Balbony?
Asjemenou. Asjemenou¡C
It's beautiful. Very beautiful. What do you think?
Maybe a convertible? A little wind through your hair back.
The hood down?
I think I'll take it. - Leave us alone.
That's a good choice friend. Speed?yellow. Good choice.
Said.
Who is it? - Who do you think?
That's a terrorist. His mother lives here.
I just need her phone.
There will be no retaliation in Kuwait.
There will be someone at a point die in Pakistan.
Do we have an agreement?
INTELLIGENCE TECHNIQUES
Said called on progress but you're not gonna like it.
The boys pull the ground after, but there is no team there now can.
He has said nothing accuse ends, but it is in Rawal Pindi Rawal in Call center.
Why did you not tell the team in Rawal Pindi to stay?
One, because it is dangerous.
And because the area is too busy to be effective to be obtained without intelligence.
Therefore there are teams to shorten the reaction time.
It would not work. - Why not?
He does not stay long enough on the phone. ?- You have not tried.
Look, I'm not staff. - That's bullshit, man.
Is that so? No one has slept Pakistan since we keep an eye on.
Yeah, I understand. But it makes me no matter whether you are asleep or not.
That guy you're obsessed.
What's his name again. - Abu Ahmed Alkuedi Saddam Tekur.
We think his real name, Ibrahim Said.
His family lives in Kuwait. We listen to them phone calls.
Were it not, we eight brothers and a million cousins?
Anyone can call home. - I know.
He says not: "Hey Mom, it's me, the terrorist '?
Yeah, I know. But for two months.
He from six different phones from two different cities called.
and not once the same phone twice.
And when his mother asked where he was, he lied.
He said he was in a country with bad reception.
implying that he joined the tribesmen Sat
But in fact he was at the market in Peshawar.
I'm sorry but that is not normal behavior. That's espionage techniques.
Maybe he just is not his mother.
If he has surgery or.
but also something different, then I'm going with it.
No, not okay, look.
Abu Ahmed's too smart to use the phone to let others know what he intends
He's working for bin Laden.
The boys by phone work talk, get that job.
Many of my friends died who have tried.
I think I'm spared to finish the job.
are surveillance cameras and photos as the exploded car.
just before it was parked.
that the police hoped the man to catch who did this.
and havoc have left to Time Square.
There are people in the world that our freedom so threatening like.
that they are willing to kill us and others, to prevent us.
I really need to talk to you about increasing our surveillance operation of the caller.
We do not control operation of the caller.
Someone just tried Time Square on to blow, and you're talking about.
prisoner seven years ago that maybe working with Al Qaeda.
He's the key to bin Laden.
I do not care about bin Laden. I care about the next attack.
You will work on the U.S. Al Qaeda cells. Protect the homeland.
bin Laden is the one who tells them to the homeland to attack.
If he was not there then Al Qaeda not focused on goals by sea.
If you really want to protect the homeland, then you catch bin Laden.
That guy has never met bin Laden.
These guys work freelance on the internet.
Nobody bin Laden four years not spoken, he's out.
He may be dead, he's probably already dead, but you know what you're doing.
is a ghost chasing you, and the damn network closes around you.
You just want me a lowly worthless guy pick that you can.

You have a real terrorist address.
But the truth is, you do not Pakistan Al Qaeda understands and you know not.
So give me the team I need, or otherwise comes into your resume to stand.
is you who are the first boss for the conference committee to come.
because of the failure of the in the capture or death of bin Laden.
You're crazy.
I telexes and a safe house in Rawal Pindi need.
Telexes and a safe house in Peshawar.
Send them, or send me back to DC and place the Director explain why you did not do it.
I was looking for you. But more importantly, he's looking for you.
Yesterday bought your man mobile phone.
And every time his phone rings.
, this phone.
Did I linked, or not?
I think he lives close where he commits the bubbles.
And it is logical that he lives in Rawalpindi, because there's an Al Jazeera office.
It is convenient for him to be there the bands to issue.
if he transmits messages for bin Laden.
or an intermediary. So if he wants to call, he leaves the house.
is a few blocks away, swap telephone.
We should scour the neighborhood until we find him.
We got a shooter.
We're trapped.
Let me talk to him.
They say that whites do not belong here.
If they do not go away, shoot them down.

You got it sounded?
He sits to the east of us. Try market.
We had ten minutes a signal at Tipo Road.
And he went five minutes Road to Omar. Not to Gaza Road.
Daja Aba, which is in the Omar Road area. In Rawalpindi.
Heather Road, Rumi Road.
he went to the Convoi Road what a hospital is good?
So that's Hedar, Rumi Road, Said, no Gaza.
Timer, he called from Heather Street.
That is the Spice district. Lahore Street, which is also located in the Pesh. 30 Minutes.
Runs on Bag Road, five.
Nishtarabad, five. Nishtarabad¡A5 .
Thunder Road, five minutes.
the Grand Trunk Road, 45 seconds.
There's no pattern. Sometimes he calls to two weeks then every three.
There is not a constant. I can not predict when he calls, because he is unpredictable.
You there, returned.
Meanwhile confirms our chief correspondent Richard Angel.
top spy for the CIA.
in Pakistan, there has been withdrawn from. He gets death threats.
after he publicly named in lawsuit by the family.
of a victim, a U.S. unit.
Richard Angel confirms that the main information.
says the officer back to the U.S.
after the decision is made that the terrorist threat against him.
in Pakistan were so serious that it would be unwise not to act.
ISI has fucked you.
I'm so sorry, Joseph.
He's at tower three. Five.
The signal is stronger. 10, 15, keep going. 20, 15.
10, the signal is weaker.
We lost him. No signal more.
Go to the south.
He's up at five. 15.
20, he goes fast. He sits in a vehicle. Weaker now. He has switched telephone.
Back in five. He must be somewhere near.
I do not understand.
He runs in circles.
Change street? - No.
Let's hope he comes back.
Okay, 15.
20, 30. 20, 30 .
40, 50. 40, 50 .
We are within ten meters.
Return 40. He's here somewhere.
Look at the cars. He's in a vehicle.
That guy is on the phone. ?In the white car.
Do you see him?
Is that him? - Maybe.
You got it? - I got him.
Okay, print it.
The guy you're looking for is located, with his mobile phone in his white car.
Thank you.
If you're right, the world this fall.
So you have to keep the truce.
Okay, no it's great to have you to speak again.
I'm just surprised you're still here.
I can. Let me take a look.
Let's say half past one.
Can you hang on?
I need a check along the highway and repeatedly along the way and at every exit.
Maya, I know.
So you agree with me that this is important.
No, but I've learned from my predecessor.
that life is more comfortable if I do not stop talking.
Our current hypothesis is that somewhere it live along the highway.
In one of the villages or a typical town called Abbottabad.
Or near Kashmir.
Kashmir is interesting because it is a way station for the tribes.
Abbottabad is interesting because we prisoners know.
that Abu Faraj briefly in 2003.
The good news is that he drives a white SUV.
SUVs are quite rare in Pakistan.
If he had a sedan or a compact we were the cigar.
Of course, provided that he is not in vehicle swap.
Good morning.
Hurry up.
Every American in Pakistan is a target.
They do not necessarily know that I'm from the CIA.
It does not matter. You're on a list.
And you should know if you're on their list.
then you'll never get from.
Next time there is perhaps no bulletproof glass to protect you.
We'll keep an eye on you as well as we can.
The high-resolution version, can you show? - Here you have it, it's this.
Can it even more? Okay that's good, thanks.
Give me that but, thanks. - Do you have that?
Can you edit the audio, so I can listen to?
Okay, how are we doing so far for?
We have a man who worked for him. We lost him for seven years.
Now we find him back and show he's a very nice house.
Can you follow? - Yes.
Okay, let's go talk with the chef.
Oh, you should sit back there. Sorry.
So they are going to ask whether bin Laden at the end of this rainbow is.
Or the military guard with him.
The question is not whether the guards protecting him, the question is whether bin Laden permits.
Why would he trust them? Mashar They tried to murder.
Okay, start.
There is a link here Islamabad when you go out.
and you go three quarters to the north you come here, in Abbottabad.
general modal population, some ex servicemen.
Not really interesting for us. But we found this unique area.
There is a high wall around it. The windows are shuttered.
There's even a separate privacy wall so.
even if we can overcome we did not benefit from.
I mean, it is a fortress. - Can not place a camera somewhere?
Between these trees for example. Overlooking the main residence.
That will probably be discovered.
But we have in the house can watch is not it?
And what is this building concentration here?
The PMA. The Pakistani Military Academy.
That's their main course.
And how far is that from the house? - About a mile.
4021 Feet, which is closer than eight tenths mile.
Who are you? - I'm the asshole who has discovered.
Really?
I want at the end of the week know who else in this house sits.
Asshole?
Good morning, George.
21 Days.
Since we house 21 days ago have discovered nothing more happened.
Yes? - Maya, Steve.
Come along, I want to show you something.
You can make it so, we play.
Maya, come look.
This is a few minutes ago.
Remember that we have two men and two women and seven children.
What's that? - I think it's camouflage.
for the wife of his brother. - How do you know the sex?
Here hangs a clothesline and men involved concerned do not join.
It takes her four seconds of the door to get there.
What's that? - These are children who are playing.
You can see their attraction to see here. These are cows.
So the boys are between seven and nine years old.
Your women are moving fast. - That I wanted to show a break please.
?That's not the same woman. That's wife number three.
So you have two men and three women found?
That's right.
But if there are three women, would there are three men should be.
Muslim women live with their parents or to their spouse.
We think there is a third family living in the house.
So the third man that you see 's probably bin Laden.
I hope too much as I like a photo want to see him?
Hope? Yes. Give your hopes but, currently.
We scan heat. But we can not see what the sex is.
We wanted a precision camera but the risk of detection is too big.
?We found a shelter but we can not find a place.
to a telescope on the balcony to go places.
We have the ability to view digging tunnels.
to hot air balloons.
To supply change but that would be too much to fall.
We have tried to collect DNA from their garbage.
You know, look for toothbrushes and stuff. But they burn the waste.
We have a vaccination program started.
We have a doctor in the house sent to see if he could take blood.
But that was all to no avail.
We have devised to send someone with a bag for a.
sample from the sewer to take. To his stool analysis.
What was actually wrong with it?
What was wrong with that?
The sample was too unclear.
And is it too much to ask for a call the phone with him?
They can not call from the complex. We have nearby stations off.
And I also have given up hope that the white SUV still comes back.
And around a bit before riding that we can see him.
Do they not groceries?
The unknown third man does not retrieve messages.
He leaves the complex and not give us no chance pictures.
If he needs fresh air he goes to the grape garden behind.
But the leaves are so thick that it hinders our satellite.
This is professionally designed to discover to avoid.
Real espionage techniques.
The only people we have seen done from Al Qaeda top level.
Put it in red in your overview.
They claim that this behavior of other than Al Qaeda.
They gave a 40% probability that the unknown higher Al Qaeda member could be.
But it was also 35 percent a Saudi drug trader.
15 Percent on a Kuwaiti arms smuggler.
10 Percent chance that a relationship of one of the brothers.
In principle, we agree with you. The house shrieks of monitoring, or someone wants privacy.
It even points to bad people but it does not point to bin Laden.
I see. If you can not prove that bin Laden is, prove that it is another.
Like a drug dealer.
You know that we have the opportunity to prove lost then.
We study the detainees lost. Who the hell should I ask?
If a figure from Guantanamo Bay will say that it was not bin Laden.
You'll think of something.
He was the first successful drug dealer who has never acted in drugs.
He has no internet access. He does not ring. Not in or out.
To whom he sells? From whom he buys? How he earns his money?
And if you say that he is retired. Ask me, where's the pool?
Where is the golden cage with the falcons?
Why he sends his messengers to the two cities in Pakistan.
we most associate with Al Qaeda.
That has nothing to do with heroin production.
The president is a thoughtful man. And he wants to see proof.
Go ahead men.
I must admit that your job.
I just do not click with politics. - So you think this is political?
This was political in October when we had elections.
This is purely risk based on careful thought and influences.
repositioning and appreciate the opinion a six.
of prisoners surveyed when they were tortured.
The political move here is to tell you that you should rot and.
and you have to remember that I was there when your old boss WWMD Rock hired.
You bought at least pictures. - You're right, I'll give everything to.
What I meant was that a man in your position.
How do you assess the risks in to do nothing?
The risk that bin Laden still eludes you.
That's an interesting question.
I'm not saying we're going to do.
But the president wants to know if if we will intervene.
how we do that. Give us some options.
Officially not exist.
I have this project already want to quit.
They are well received by the test and have excellent radar experiences.
We just have not been tested on humans.
You have probably seen the Stealth panels. As we used the B2.
The rotors are treated with decibel killers.
He's slower than the Black Hawk. Despite its strength and stability.
But he can do with measuring.
What we need this in Libya? Their antiaircraft guns is almost invisible.
Maya, would you tell?
There are two possibilities regarding to the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden.
The person you know best is that OBL hiding in a cave in the mountains.
That he is surrounded by a large group loyal warriors.
But this variant as OBL for 9/11 did.
The second variant is that he lives in a city.
In a city with multiple off and roads.
Access to communication. So he remains in contact with the organization.
You can such a large network, with international cells did not result from a cave.
We have a person located which we believe it is the courier of bin Laden.
He lives in a house somewhere near the border with Pakistan.
And we assume.
that one of the other occupants of the house Osama bin Laden.
I'm sorry, so OBL, do you have a informant there?

How do you know that bin Laden is?
Because we have been here a long time and we have already been earlier thought we had him.
and then we lost men. - We understand perfectly.
bin Laden used a courier for his contact with the outside world.
by courier to find we found bin Laden.
That's a real informant. - And that's all?
I really wanted you do not use.
With all your whining and drivel. I wanted to throw a bomb.
But the people believed not enough to me to throw a bomb.
So you use them as scouts.
and if it appears that bin Laden is not there you can sneak away and they are the brightest.
But bin Laden was there.
And you're gonna kill me for.
They are nervous.
I do not think we go approval given for the decisions I've taken.
It's them against the world.
I'm the president to face.
So I want to know, and no nonsense.
what everyone here thinks of it.
Okay, very simple. Is he there or not?
We have come to this by our past experience.
I remember one case WMD.
And this was not the case as clear as this.
I want to fuck and yes or a no.
We give no assurance but possibilities.
And I would say that 60% chance that he's there.
I agree. 60%.
I'm going for 80%. Your explanation has convinced me.
Are you somewhere it's never about? - I agree with Mike.
Everything is based on reports of prisoners.
I have a lot of time spent in those rooms.
I would say almost 60%.
I'm sure there's a major but I'm not sure if it was bin Laden.
This is a bit of a failure huh?
I would like to know what Maya think.
We all go along with her decision. - 100% that he is there.
Okay fine, 95% than for the security freak, but it's 100.
They are all numbered.
What do you think of the woman? - I think she's damn smart.
We're all smart Jeremy.
Can I sit in?
How's the food here, anyway? - It's okay.
How long have you been in the CIA? - Twelve years.
I'm enrolled in college. - Do you know why we did that?
I do not believe that I question can answer.
I do not think it's allowed to answer.
What have you got for us? Outdoor bin Laden.
Nothing.
I've done nothing else.
You have at least a knack for.



Okay, let's do seriously. - Yes, and no more running mad friend.
I'm up to two games before. - Please.
Patrick tell me honestly to me, do you believe this story true?
No offense, but Osama bin Laden.
What part did I miss?
Her confidence.
That is a concrete data point where I'm looking for.
I'll tell you my friend, that her trust me from looking at.
butts to pack into a Pakistani prison.
I'm good at.
I want you to hear it first.
You know the one where we talked about? That will happen.
When? - Tonight.
Good luck.
50 Dollar? - 50 Dollar.
fluke.
We're going running, understand?
Roger that.
another 30 seconds for the first turn.
?Hey Justin, what are you listening to? - Tony Robbins.
Tony Robbins, really? - You would even have to listen.
I have plans below. A big job, so I want you all to speak.
Who has ever flown in a helicopter?
Okay we're all good.
We just crossed the border and are now in Pakistan.
