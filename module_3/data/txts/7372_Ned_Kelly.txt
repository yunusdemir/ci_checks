<i>I was the hero
of Hughes creek.</i>
<i>I can still see the glint
in me da's eye</i>
<i>as he looked down at me,</i>
<i>his hand on me shoulder.</i>
<i>What did he call me that day?</i>
<i>Ah, what did da call me?</i>
<i>That's right.</i>
<i>He called me sunshine.</i>
You're a pretty girl.
You're wild Wright's horse,
aren't ya?
I know whose ya are.
It's all right.
I'll look after ya.
Handsome looking horse
you got there, ned.
You're cuttin' a flash,
all right.
Ah, great.
You're ned Kelly,
aren't ya'?
Red Kelly's boy?
Get down, Jane.
Fine animal
you got there.
Distinctive,
wouldn't you say?
She's wild Wright's.
That's the postmaster's mare.
No, it isn't.
It's wild Wright's.
He lost her when
she bolted into the bushes.
You're a liar, Kelly.
No, I'm not.
I found her this morning, grazing.
She's been
reported stolen.
Stolen, me arse!
A horse thief!
Get your hands off me!
You're under arrest.
Stand, Kelly, or I swear to
god, I'll shoot you down.
I was only going
after the horse.
You were trying to
escape, you blaggard!
You're just <i>as</i> thick
as your bloody father.
Jesus Christ!
Now, what are you trying to do?
I'm gonna tan
your hide for that.
Strike an officer, and
you'll bloody swing for it!
Strike you down to the ground!
No blows struck yet,
constable hall!
Help me, someone!
Oh, help him!
Help constable hall!
Poor constable hall!
He's such a fuckin' rat!
He's trying to kill me,
the rascally blaggard!
Help me, someone!
Stand put!
Go on!
Put me down!
He tried to shoot me,
for Christ's sake!
All right! All right!
Is that the best you can do,
you bloody coward'?
Go on. I can take it.
Wait! That's enough!
Hello there!
Please, can you help me?
Hello! Hello there!
Please!
Slow it down, please!
Come on! Come on!
Please!
Please, now!
Oh, come on!
Give us a ride, you bastards!
Christ, it's muddy
enough to bog a dog.
So, where'd you
go after beechworth?
Mayday hills on a road gang.
Ah, you see Sean Gallagher?
I heard he was up there.
Yeah. I saw him for a while.
Hey.
See that?
I think that's old man wicks and...
What's his daughter called?
Sarah.
Sarah. That's right.
She's a picture.
Oh, we could be in luck, boys.
Mr. wicks,
good mornin'.
Mr. wicks, I don't know
if you remember me.
I'm Aaron sherritt,
Mr. wicks.
If you could just
hold up for one moment...
If anyone can persuade an old
man to share his daughter
with three larrikins
like us, it'll be Aaron.
So how's me ma?
What?
Ah, the coppers have been
giving her a hard time, ned.
Something goes missin',
a bullock or anything, they come
round the middle of the night,
tear the place apart, scarin'
the kiddies and all, you know.
She's had it hard.
Come on, lads!
Jump up!
Well, will you
look at that?
What did <i>I</i> tell ya?
Thank you very much, sir.
Thanks a lot, Mr. wicks.
Thank you, Mr. wicks.
Dan!
Ma, there's
someone coming.
Oh, god. It's ned.
Neddy!
Mummy,
i named Hobson's kookaburra.
What did you name
him, darlin'?
Beefy, 'cause
he likes beef.
Well, that's a fine little
name for a kookaburra, grace.
Who's the
proud father, ma?
Don't even ask.
He's a long time gone.
That's all there is to it.
The stinkin' proddy.
He was a yank.
George the Baker.
We were married, ned,
right and proper.
Well, that's grand, ma.
Jesus Christ! Will you stop your messin'?
I'm sick of the pair of ya.
Give your mother some respect, or I'll give
ya a hidin', both of youse, ya hear me'?
And who are
you, anyways?
Steve hart.
Well, seein' as how the two
of you are so full of beans,
you can both get off your <i>asses</i>
and help me fix up this place.
You haven't done a minute's
work to help your ma, have you?
Come on, everyone.
Sit down, now.
What kind of stew is it?
Wombat. A wombat's a marsupial,
and it lives in a hole.
I know, darlin'.
I put one in the stew.
Shh.
Ned, would you like
to say the grace'?
All right.
Dear lord, thank you for
looking after me mother,
me sister grace,
me sister Kate
and me brother Dan.
Thank you, lord, for our
beautiful baby Ellen...
And for this wonderful
stew made out of wombat.
- Amen.
- Amen.
<i>It's not easy for an irishman
in queen Victoria's colony,</i>
<i>to walk the straight and narrow,</i>
<i>but I toed the line,</i>
<i>despite all temptations.</i>
<i>With me fighting
with my fists for money.</i>
<i>And after all, I did three
years for that stolen horse.</i>
<i>Wild Wright only got
18 months.</i>
<i>You think I was gonna
let that one slide?</i>
I declare ned the winner!
The bets are in.
Ease up, not to worry.
So, are we square?
Course we are, you mad bugger.
Come here!
Thank Christ for that!
<i>Could it be possible that the
Kellys were finally getting ahead?</i>
<i>That I could actually
better meself?</i>
Steady.
Excuse me.
You there.
Would you mind coming and
holding my horse's thing?
All right.
Steady.
Now, what thing are you
talkin' about, ma'am?
Are you gonna
help me or not?
I've been riding him
pretty hard the last two days.
Poor thing's been
holding on since Saturday.
His bladder's
paralyzed with the colic.
Good god.
Have you got that?
Right there.
Good. Good.
Just hold it there.
Keep still.
I'm glad that's
not me. Christ.
Steady.
Okay. All right.
Watch your boots, boys!
Whoo!
It looks like you've done
this kind of thing before.
Only on horses.
Ah, thank
god for that.
My name's ned Kelly.
Pleased to meet ya.
Hello, ned.
Right.
Watch out, lads!
Here he goes again!
Clear the way!
The horse is too wild.
It can't be broken.
A waste of damn money.
Fetch my rifle, please.
What?
You can't just shoot a
horse 'cause it's wild.
What else can we do?
We can't keep it here.
Why don't you
set it free, then?
I could break that horse
for you if you like.
I've broken horses before.
You can ask around.
I'd like to give it
a try, at least.
We know there's not much point.
The horse is bad.
Thank you.
What did he say?
He said what
a lucky fellow I am
to be with
such a beauty <i>as</i> you.
Too lucky,
if you ask me.
Oh, hello, Kate.
I didn't see you there.
Fancy seeing you here.
I'm just having a swift
pint after work.
It's not like I'm
a regular or anything.
A man needs to relax
after a hard day's work.
What would you know
about a hard day's work?
Sleeping and drinking and beatin' up
yellow fellows is all you ever seem to do.
That's not fair, now.
I'm only
doing me job.
I get along
with everybody.
Everybody gets along with me.
Can I buy you
a drink, Kate?
No, thank you.
I have money.
I just wanna
buy you a drink.
I said I don't want one.
You're startin' to get on me nerves now.
Think you're too good for me?
Is that it?
Who do you think
you are? Hmm?
Let go of me bloody arm.
You're hurtin' me.
Let go of
her arm, you.
I'm just bein'
friendly, ned.
Just offering the
young lady a drink.
Well, she doesn't want one
from the likes of you.
A problem there,
Fitzpatrick?
No. There's no problem
here, constable.
I'm sorry
if I upset you...
Kate.
Right.
This one's a request
from ned Kelly.
Right.
Follow me, lads.
One, two...
The nerve of the bloody knacker.
Look at him.
Acts as if
he owns the place.
Dan, come here and dance
with your sister!
Come on!
That fella needs taking down a
peg or two, that's for sure.
Ned, the horses are gone.
What?
The biggest thieves and
liars the sun ever shone on.
The victorian police.
Well, I'm telling you
something now, boys.
I'm not gonna let these bloody
maggots put one over on me.
<i>To change
a horse's brand is easy,</i>
<i>easier than you'd think.</i>
<i>You just pluck the little hairs
and prick the skin with iodine.</i>
<i>A</i> "c" or an "o"
can become a "q"
<i>"q" for Quinn, me
mother's maiden name.</i>
Who's that at this
hour of the night?
Dan, is Kate in?
Yeah, she is.
Well, would you mind telling
her I'd like a word, please?
In private, like.
No, I won't.
She wants nothing to do with you.
You know that full well.
Well, I'd like to hear
that from her, if you don't mind.
Fitzpatrick,
you've already heard that
from her many a time.
Will you do
yourself a favor?
Take a ride home.
You think you're
so smart, byrne.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I've a warrant for you.
You've no warrant, you fool.
Was you and Kelly
stole them horses.
I know it was, and i
have a warrant for you.
Ned and all.
I've warrants for the both of ya.
I don't suppose I could see
them warrants, could I?
There's your warrants.
Hmm? There's
your warrants.
Oh, hello.
I just came down
to find my riding jacket.
I thought I left it
here somewhere.
I haven't seen it.
Oh, I was sure it was here.
Well, if I find it, I'll be sure to
bring it up to the house for ya.
All right, then.
Right.
You're from england?
Yes.
Surrey, actually.
You're Irish?
Yeah. Me da was from tipperary,
but I was born here.
I've never
been to Ireland.
I came over
when I was 17.
Richard acquired the land
through his family, and...
My da had to go to all the
trouble of stealing a sheep
to get the
trip over here.
He got a free fare then.
He was lucky.
Yeah.
How are you tonight?
Fine.
Till you showed up.
Drink, boys?
Steve?
I don't drink
with coppers.
Aye_
there's no
need for that.
So I'm leaving
here tomorrow.
The work here
for me is finished now.
Yes, I know.
So I won't be
seeing you any more.
You sure you don't want to have a better
look for that riding jacket of yours?
No. I...
I must have left it in
the house somewhere.
Well, it was nice
to have met you.
I really should go.
I think you're the most
beautiful woman I've ever seen.
You don't have any
warrants at all, do you?
Oh, I do,
Mrs. Kelly.
I do.
I don't believe this.
You just plain
thick or what?
Come on, Kate.
I'm just having a bit of fun, you know.
Now, let's see
those bloody warrants.
I've split me head open!
You bastards!
It's your hand,
you bloody idiot.
Hey, Fitzpatrick.
Bottom rung
on top now, huh?
Shoot him.
Don't, Dan.
Give him back
his bloody gun.
Go on! Get!
I'll be back for ya,
ya bastards.
Can you believe the brass
neck on that idiot?
Trying to be all
friendly with the grog.
Yeah. He soon sobered up when
you pointed the gun at him.
See his face?
I'm glad you think
this is all very funny.
Where have you been?
Never mind where I've been.
What's happened?
Fitzpatrick couldn't hold
his Brandy and lemonade.
What are you talking about?
We had a fight
with Fitzpatrick.
A fight? Why?
He said he had warrants
for me and you.
What warrants?
Horse stealing, but there
was a load of shite in it.
Whether it was or wasn't,
there's trouble now either way.
Ah, ma. You can't take
that fellow seriously.
How can you stand there and act
like this is one big joke,
after all the trouble we've had
with coppers in this family?
What are you thinking, Joe?
I'm thinking you and Dan ought to
clear out of here for a day or two,
just to be safe.
God willing,
it'll all blow over.
What the hell
happened to you?
Ned Kelly shot me.
He what?
Take your rotten hands
off me, you bastard!
Get off her!
You're under arrest!
I'm taking you to the cells!
You filthy, unclean bastards!
Ned!
Ned!
Ned. Jesus, ned,
they've arrested ma.
They what? Yeah.
They've taken her to the cells,
charged her
with attempted murder.
Attempted murder?
And Fitzpatrick's saying
you took a shot at him.
I wasn't even there.
We know that, but it's
your word against his.
Take the word of a drunken liar
and arrest an innocent woman?
Is that right?
I won't take
this injustice!
I'm gonna kill him!
I swear I'll scatter his blood
and brains like rain!
Ned! Ned! No!
Stand aside!
No, ned!
Don't make this
worse for ma!
Stop it, ned!
Take the children
inside, please.
What are you doing here?
They arrested me ma.
What for?
The copper <i>says</i>
i tried to kill him.
Why?
Oh, 'cause he's a bastard liar
like all coppers, that's why.
The thing is.
I wasn't even there.
I was here with you.
You could tell the truth.
Show the swine up for
the drunken liar he is.
And then they'd
have to release me ma.
That's impossible.
I couldn't.
Do you realize
what that would mean?
Yes.
I can't.
I'd be disgraced.
He'd take away
my children, and...
It's all right.
I understand.
Ned.
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Right.
<i>I made them
an offer at the outset</i>
<i>charge me
and let me mother go.</i>
<i>The answer came back,</i>
<i>"we don't bargain
with outlaws.</i>
<i>"We 'll catch you anyway. "</i>
You see those stretchers?
You know what they're for'?
The bastards ain't plannin' on
takin' prisoners, that's for sure.
There's another party down past
the neck of bullock creek.
Four of 'em.
They've hemmed us in
on either side,
whether they
know it or not.
We'll come back at dawn,
hold up these two,
take their guns and horses.
At least then we'll have a
chance of making a run for it.
Right.
Drop your arms!
Christ,
it's lonigan, ned.
You've killed lonigan.
Do you want
marmalade, ned?
Are you gonna
kill me or what?
I'll leave the force
first thing tomorrow morning.
I swear it on
me mother's life, ned.
Ned.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Do <i>as</i> I said,
and no one will get shot.
Sergeant, you'd
better surrender.
You're surrounded.
You been into the whiskey
again, you old sod?
Get some toast
on there, lonigan.
Lonigan's gone,
and you two'll be next
if you don't get off
them damn horses.
Oh, Christ!
Give it up, man!
It's over!
If you stop running,
i won't shoot you. I swear.
Why didn't you surrender?
I wouldn't have shot ya.
I can't breathe!
No!
I can't breathe!
Right, right, right.
Listen.
It's okay.
I can't breathe.
One minute. One minute.
One minute.
It's all right.
It's all right.
Oh!
Why did you have to run?
I wouldn't have shot ya.
Goddamn.
Look. No.
I don't wanna die like this.
No. No.
I'm sorry
i shot you.
I don't wanna...
I got a wife and two children.
What are they gonna
do without me?
What are they gonna
do without...
No!
Look at me.
Look at me!
God forgive me!
God forgive me.
<i>I don't know why
i took his watch.</i>
<i>It was something to do
with him not needing it.</i>
<i>Later, I thought about
sending it to his family.</i>
<i>But by then, the papers had me
down as some sort of monster</i>
<i>so I thought,
"no point now.</i>
<i>"I'm damned anyway. "</i>
Is it true what they've been
saying about the three coppers?
Yeah, it's true.
Oh, god.
Well, it was
a fair fight, ma.
Better them than ned.
They'll kill him now.
They'll kill him for sure.
Don't shoot, lad.
I'm unarmed.
Come on, put that away.
There aren't any troops.
Aw.
You're bloody chirpy for
this hour of the morning.
Gotta keep
your voice down.
I've a visitor.
Who?
Mary he9afty-
Mary hegarty!
Mmm.
Jesus.
She can be only 13.
I'm not superstitious.
Well, well,
well, well, well.
I've never met men whose lives
are worth £2,000 before,
especially not Irish men
£2,000.
Is that what
it's up to?
I'm sure my cock alone's
worth more than that.
I could do with
the money meself.
I'd build a shed out the
back, buy a few horses.
In fact, I could buy half of
beechworth with all that.
That's very funny, Aaron.
Clause two.
They've recalled
parliament.
Passed something called "the
felons apprehension act."
It means we're
listed as outlaws.
We can be shot on sight
by anyone who chooses.
<i>They said I'd lost
what it meant to be human.</i>
<i>Maybe I never had it
in the first place.</i>
<i>But wasn't this about
protecting the ones I loved,</i>
<i>the ones who gave me
food and shelter,</i>
<i>even the clothes on me back?</i>
<i>And therefore,
wasn't it now a war?</i>
Dan,
you see
that wooden gate?
Around the back there
is their living quarters.
If anyone's there,
you keep 'em there.
Can I help you?
Yes, you can.
Me name's Edward Kelly.
His mates
call him ned.
Ned Kelly?
I'm sure I've heard
that name somewhere...
I'm sure you have, sir.
Stay where you are.
What do you think
you're doing?
Who are you?
Going to a funeral, eh?
Better do <i>as</i> I say,
or it'll be your own.
Ma.
Shh.
Fanny Shaw, what are
you doing here?
I work here.
Jeez,i can't
believe it
what are you
doing here, Steve?
We're robbing the bank.
Me and Fanny used
to go to school together.
Steve.
Hello, kiddies.
You're ned Kelly.
That's right.
What are you going
to do with us?
Well, you're coming with us
to faithfulls creek.
We can't leave
anyone behind
to raise the alarm,
now, can we?
Mr. Kelly, we are supposed to
be attending a funeral today.
As you can see, I'm
dressed in mourning wear.
Obviously unsuitable
for a woman
traveling in the countryside,
hostage or not.
Even a blaggard like yourself...
Susan!
I do apologize
for my wife's behavior.
There is no need to apologize
on my account, Charles.
The man is wearing a magenta
cravat, for god's sake.
I have an outfit just
arrived from Melbourne.
L'eau du nil silk.
Well, you'd better
put it on then.
Go on.
Joe, you should follow her,
make sure she doesn't
signal from the windows
with her bloomers
or something.
How dare you!
Sure. I'm doing no harm.
What are these,
these skulls?
I collect them.
Hello.
So you're Joe byrne?
The papers say you have
the facial features
of a creature
born to crime.
I'm the handsome one
in the bunch.
They also said you married a
Spanish housemaid in deniliquin
with the exotic
name of madela.
We were just good friends.
Mmm, I suppose you have
a lot of good friends.
I'm sure there's no harm
in being friendly.
No.
I don't suppose
there is.
Oh, you're a beast,
an absolute beast.
She's taking
an awfully long time.
Tried to get up on
the horse and
he just fell off the other
side right into a puddle.
Oh, you'll never guess
who I ran into last week.
Who?
Danny O'Reilly.
Yeah?
He's working on the new rail
line to wangaratta.
He's got a wife and three kids.
Sure. That's grand.
I haven't seen him
in at least three years.
That's like one kid
every year.
Hey, ned.
Look at this.
Mortgages.
One of 'em's for old
man wicks' place.
I recognize a couple
of the others, too.
But they're of
no use to you.
They're the only records
i have of the bank's debtors.
Can I have them back, please?
No.
<i>So I killed
their policeman,</i>
<i>and I robbed their bank,</i>
<i>but burning their mortgages...
Well, that was destroying crown property.</i>
<i>It was like slappin' queen
Victoria herself across the face.</i>
<i>So they send in hare,</i>
<i>superintendent Francis hare, late
of cape town, South Africa.</i>
<i>And wasn't this the challenge of
your whole life, superintendent?</i>
<i>A feather in your cap.</i>
<i>You can't catch me.</i>
<i>You don't have
a hope of catching me,</i>
<i>so you take
my friends instead.</i>
<i>Over 100 men arrested,</i>
<i>stuck in stinkin' cells
without trial,</i>
<i>while their crops
perish in the fields.</i>
<i>And guess what?</i>
<i>Not one of 'em caves in
and tries to claim the reward,</i>
<i>not one of 'em.</i>
<i>They loved me just the same and hated
you all the more, didn't they?</i>
<i>Did you really think I was
gonna let 'em all rot?</i>
£2,500.
There's enough to pay rent on the
leaseholds for the lads left in jail.
Thomas, you can take what
you need for your mother
to pay off her debt
to mcteague.
Thanks, ned.
And there's some for mckinleys and bill
skilling, whatever he needs for his da.
Have you heard
anything about me ma?
They set a trial at
the end of last month.
She's been given
three years hard labor.
I'm sorry, ned.
I say, give me that back.
That blaggard
just stole my watch.
They say the lord helps
those who help themselves.
Give him
back his watch.
What?
You heard what I said.
I said, give him back his damn watch.
Have you gone simple
all of a sudden?
We're robbing the bank.
Listen here, kid.
This is the last time I tell ya.
Give him back his damn watch.
You're not innocent men.
You're a bunch
of common criminals.
Now, did you hear that?
If we act like common thieves,
that's just what they'll call us.
My mother is rotting away
in a prison cell,
because of the lies of a
policeman named Fitzpatrick.
She's an innocent woman,
and so are these boys here.
My Irish brethren have been
unlawfully imprisoned,
and blacklisted
from their selections.
How do you
expect me to behave
other than to stand up
against this treatment?
Any one of you here
can take a shot at me
and not be charged for it.
There's me gun.
Any of you feeling brave
enough, go ahead.
No?
That's what I thought.
So if I can beg your Patience,
this is my statement,
to the premier of Victoria,
Graham Berry,
and you here
are my witnesses.
Joe, take out
a pen and paper.
We'll write ourselves
a letter.
Dear sir...
Dear sir...
"Dear sir,
"i wish to acquaint you with
some of the occurrences
"of the present,
past and future.
"It will pay government to give
those people who are suffering..."
...justice and Liberty.
"...justice and Liberty.
"I seek revenge for the evil
name given me and my relations.
"By the light that shines,
this is my warning."
My brother and
sisters and mother
have to put up with the brutal and
cowardly conduct of a parcel of...
"...big, ugly---"
...big, ugly,
fat-necked...
". . .Fat-necked..."
Wombat-headed.
Wombat-headed.
"...wombat-headed,
big-bellied..."
Magpie-legged!
Magpie-legged. Thank you very much, ma'am.
Joe, write that down.
Magpie-legged.
". ..Narrow-hipped,
splaw-footed,
"sons of Irish bailiffs..."
Or English landlords
better known as what?
Victorian police.
This section here you might find
less amusing, superintendent.
I give fair warning to all those
who have reason to fear me.
Not to attempt
to reside in Victoria.
<i>Neglect this and abide
by the consequences,</i>
<i>which shall be worse than
the rust in the wheat.</i>
I do not wish to give this order
full force without timely warning,
but I am a widow's
son outlawed,
and my orders
must be obeyed.
Hey! Look!
It's ned Kelly.
Look!
Oh, my god.
It's ned Kelly
and Joe byrne.
Can I get
a kiss then?
Of course you can.
And a ladies' man, eh?
Where will you go, ned?
The country
belongs to us.
And we'll go wherever we like.
I hear you're planning on getting
married, starting a family.
Well, I'll tell
you this, lad.
Your lack of cooperation will make it
very hard for me to get you out of here
and back to that
girl of yours.
I got nothing
to tell you.
I don't need to tell you about the
reward out on him. It's a lot of money.
You could put it
to good use.
You're a friend of Joseph
byrne, aren't you?
You've known each other
since childhood,
served time together,
am I right?
Aaron, it's
the Kellys we want.
We don't care about Joe.
But if we let this
run its course,
he'll be shot down
like the others.
The only chance your friend
will have depends on you.
And if you'll help
me with this,
I'll guarantee
his safety.
Ned!
<i>Jesus Christ.
Come on.</i>
Let's go.
Sir.
They've poisoned it.
<i>Lying low, living in caves,
you get to learn sometimes.</i>
<i>Eventually, you can read
soils and rocks like books.</i>
<i>I've watched gravel fade.</i>
<i>Dust settle into crust.</i>
<i>I've seen drips of water turn
to stone that defied gravity.</i>
<i>I've turned blood-red
with cave mud-</i>
<i>I've been a bloody rock.</i>
Sorry_
where's your husband?
Out looking for you, like
the rest of the country.
You took a risk
coming here.
Well, turn me in so.
You think god will forgive
us for what we've done, ned?
I don't know.
I suppose we're all
gonna find out one day.
Just thinking of ma rottin'
away in that cell.
Where do you think da
is, heaven or hell?
No, he wouldn't be
in hell, you know.
He wasn't such
a bad fella. He...
He was just a dumb paddy who
got picked on his whole life.
And that does something
to your pride, you know?
Can't even picture him.
When I was 10,
and they gave me
that green and gold sash
for saving that kid
from drowning,
well, that was the last
time I remember him.
He was proud
of me that day.
Are we gonna
be okay, ned?
Of course we are,
you little gorn, you.
You're just gonna keep
running, aren't you?
They'll catch
you eventually.
Or shoot you down.
Did you know they pardoned frank
gardiner in new south wales?
On condition he left the colony.
He gave himself in.
He wasn't an irishman.
Then why don't you just
leave the county now?
Try for a new life
somewhere in queensland?
No, I can't.
It's not about me.
You know there's
more to it than that.
What would it take to make
you save yourself, ned?
Hmm?
My husband's best stallion?
Take it. It's yours.
Forget the mares.
More than that.
Much more.
What then?
The red one, too,
would be nice.
With you atop
of it, beside me.
For that you'd
save yourself?
Leave your friends behind?
And you, your children.
Look.
You and me had no business with one
another in the first place, did we?
Wasn't that the
whole point of it?
Don't make me
grieve for you.
I ain't dead yet.
Rebel!
Kate.
It's all right! It's us!
Oh, you bloody swine!
It's ned. I know. Come here.
Oh, my god.
Now, Gracie, look at you.
You've grown too much.
Give us a cuddle.
Come on.
Rebel, come on.
Come on.
So, I saw that rascal, Aaron
sherritt, the other night.
Oh, yeah?
And what did you give him?
Nothing, you little scoundrel.
Hmm.
The thing is, I saw him
talking to this fella,
all friendly-like
on the way out.
Then the fella
comes back here
and starts asking me all sorts
of questions about you.
Such as?
When did I see you last?
And where you were now? That sort of thing.
Is he a copper,
do you think?
I don't know.
Well, it could've
been nothing.
I just thought you
ought to know, like.
Thanks, Maggie.
Hello, Aaron.
Joe?
Ned.
So how's things, Aaron?
Not so bad.
Well, not too bad.
I've been reading
a lot about you, ned.
You're a real terror
altogether, aren't you?
We've been meaning
to talk to you, Aaron.
We were wondering if you'd
consider acting as a scout for us.
We're heading into beechworth
to rob a bank there.
A scout?
Well, I'm flattered you'd
think of me, lads, but, uh...
You're not interested?
No, I... I'd love to.
If it was just up to me, I'd be in
there like a shot, you know that.
But I've got the missus
to think about now.
Because between you and me,
lads, she's up the spout.
Ah! She isn't?
Oh, sure, that's grand.
Congratulations, Aaron.
Oh, thanks.
Thanks.
How are Dan
and Steve?
They're fine.
Say hello to them
for me, will you?
We will.
Well, I'd best get
back to the party.
Mary will be wondering
where I got to.
Sure.
You go on and look after
that girl of yours.
I will indeed.
Sorry I can't
help you out.
Good luck with
it all anyways.

Aaron, what
are you doing?
Some coppers on horses
followed me until wangaratta,
but I met up with
tom Lloyd and bill,
and we gave 'em the slip
easy as you please.
- That's great, Katie.
- Here we go.
That's great, Katie.
Yeah, well, I wish
I'd never bloody bothered
you're all gonna
get yourselves killed.
We are not.
You bloody well are!
No, we're not, Katie.
We're gonna give 'em a show
like they've never seen before.
<i>There's a certain type of black
tribesman that bends in the wind,</i>

<i>Mostly he employs
the help of the dead</i>

<i>The "night dancer, "
they call him.</i>
God, when is someone
gonna give me some proper cards?
Who's in?
Ugh. Fold.
I'm turning in.
I guess all that losin'
would make you tired.
You in or you out?
Give me three.
- You?
- I'm out.
What's happening?
Go back to sleep, love.
Three to the English queen.
It's blessed
you are, Nigel.
Aaron!
Aaron!
Who's that?
Who is it?
Another one of your
whores, it looks like.
Just tell her to get lost, unless
she wants her head blown off.
Lizzie, is that you?
Joe.
Why do you
think he did it?
Just for the money?
Maybe he started thinking he
was some kind of big shot.
Instead of a shit-kicker's
son, like us.
We have
received word
that one of our informants
has been shot dead
by the Kelly gang
over near beechworth.
We will entrain immediately
and proceed to wangaratta.
From there, you'll be
split up into units,
and will fan out across the country,
encircling the immediate vicinity.
Stay close to your troop commanders
for your orders of march.
I would remind you all,
the men we are hunting have
not only plundered two banks,
kidnapped men,
women and children,
but have murdered three
of your fellow officers.
They have outrun us
before, gentlemen.
Do not allow them
to do so again.
Don't you worry, sir.
We'll show the bloody animals.
We'll blow 'em all
to kingdom come.
These are not
animals, constable.
These are men who have been glorified
as the leaders of a movement,
a movement that threatens the
stability of an entire country.
Underestimate them, and it will be you
who will be blown to kingdom come.
<i>They say the
trouble with the Irish</i>
<i>is that they rely
too much on dreams,</i>
<i>and not enough
on gunpowder.</i>
<i>Whereas the English were
shy on dreams, as usual,</i>
<i>but had plenty
of the other.</i>
<i>Now we had both.</i>
I suppose you're
the great Orlando.
That I am.
Well, I'm the great ned Kelly, and
this here is the fabulous Joe byrne.
We'd like to join
your circus.
Oh.
Hmm.
That's right. You're not seeing things.
It's a camel.
I've got a lion and some
ponies back down the road.
And the great
Orlando, of course.
If you're here to rob the
train, you're too late.
We're not here
to rob the train.
Joe, get this lot inside.
This good-looking fella over
here is me brother, Dan Kelly.
These are my friends.
Joe byrne
at the bar there.
And Steve hart, there
in the back corner.
And I'm ned.
We're all Irish boys
and selectors' sons.
Had war declared on us
by Victoria,
by new south wales.
By the crown.
<i>And by the London times</i> even.
The reward on our heads is the biggest
one yet offered in the world.
It's up to £8,000.
It's a lot of money.
We're the only four lads
in the whole country...
The entire empire, in fact,
that any one of you fine
citizens is allowed to kill.
No questions asked.
No, it's true.
The queen said so herself.
That's right.
It's Regina versus us,
the Kelly gang.
<i>So our plans were set.</i>
One.
<i>The traitor, Aaron sherritt,
dead, as arranged.</i>
Two.
<i>The police special from
benalla coming to meet us.</i>
<i>The line torn up to send the
train to hell, as arranged.</i>
<i>Three. Superintendent
hare, if he lives.</i>
<i>Easily worth
an outlaw's mother.</i>
<i>And four.</i>
<i>The townspeople
out of harm's way,</i>
<i>drinks on us,
as arranged.</i>
Here you go.
Oh, lamb!
My favorite.
Oh, cheer up there,
Mr. curnow.
You're witness to history.
How many schoolteachers
dream of that?
Come on, hare.
Where the hell are you?
Were you sleeping?
You thinking
of using that?
I'm mulling it over.
Right.
You don't remember
me, do you'?
You were just
a boy then.
You were riding a palomino
mare with a white Blaze.
Jane. Yeah.
Yeah.
Seems like a long time
ago, doesn't it?
A lifetime.
Where's the other fella?
Where's curnow?
Ned, curnow's gone!
Come on!
Give me a hand here!
Officer 22 quickly!
Get those horses off!
Knights in shining armor.
Curnow stopped the train.
Oh, Jesus.
What does this mean?
Hare's on his way.
You mean we didn't
get any of 'em?
Not a soul.
There'll be a hundred
of them at least.
You okay, Dan?
Yeah, I'm okay, ned.
Steve?
Short life,
but a merry one.
Joe?
Are we gonna give them a
good old fight or aren't we?
So, that's that then.
All right, everyone
listen to me!
We're getting you
out of here!
Hold your fire!
We've got women
and children coming out.
It's a trick!
Stop your firing!
Cease fire!
Hold your fire!
Cease fire!
Get down
on the floor!
Keep your heads down!
Stay on the floor!
They fired at us!
They shot him!
Keep as low as you
can, you hear?
All right.
Let's give it to 'em.
Hit the lights.
Fire!
They have armor
on their bodies!
Aim for their
arms and legs!
He's been shot!
They've shot hare!
All right.
Get back inside.
Get back inside. Come on.
Oh! Dan, reload
me pistols!
I got the bastard that shot me.
Give me that anyways.
Rifle!
Bullets. Come on.
Aw! The monkey's been shot!
Poor little bugger!
Oh, dear god.
Oh! Shit.
Somebody help me,
for Christ's sake!
Keep low! Get around
the back of the bar!
Can you find me something
to stop the bleeding?
Get down!
To hell with all
you bastards!
Ned!
Where the hell
are you going?
Get this lot
around the back.
Ned?
Now's your chance. Quickly!
Out that back door there!
Hands up, the lot of you, or
you'll be shot down like dogs!
Don't shoot!
No, no! Don't shoot!
I got him!
I got Dan Kelly!
Ahhh!
No, you bloody
well haven't.
Jesus Christ, lads.
I think I need a drink.
<i>What I best recall</i>

Do you have
any left?
Only two.
I guess that's all
we need then, isn't it?
We never stood
a chance, did we?
No
Steve.
No.
Over there!
It's ned Kelly.
Christ almighty, it's ned Kelly.
Do you mind

Hey! Look!
