<i>Last week on "Duets"...</i>
♪ Let me ♪
♪ entertain you ♪
That's how you kick off
a season of "Duets," baby.
<i>Four of America's</i>
<i>music superstars</i>
<i>all found two amateurs</i>
<i>from across the nation</i>
<i>to sing with in competition.</i>
Oh, my God!
<i>And tonight...</i>
<i>Bring it.</i>
<i>The gloves comes off.</i>
Never underestimate
the ego of the artist.
Whoo! That could be good
or bad.
I honestly think it was
the wrong song. Boo!
I was wondering if it was
your fault, Robin.
I won't throw you under the bus
like he threw my artist under the bus.
<i>The superstars are all vying</i>
<i>to get to the top of the chart.</i>
What's wrong with that?
Do we want number one? Yes.
<i>The only problem is, they have</i>
<i>to get past each other</i>
<i>to get there.</i>
All I saw was, like,
impersonation.
Hater.
<i>After each duet,</i>
<i>the superstars</i>
<i>who didn't perform</i>
<i>will give a secret score</i>
<i>to the amateur</i>
<i>based on performance</i>
<i>and presentation.</i>
Uno.
<i>The scores are combined,</i>
<i>and then the amateur's rank</i>
<i>on the chart</i>
<i>is revealed for all to see...</i>
<i>Wow.</i>
<i>For better...</i>
<i>Or for worse.</i>
Not ideal.
While no one goes home tonight,
<i>next week, the bottom two will</i>
<i>have to sing for their life...</i>
<i>In an a capella showdown,</i>
<i>sending one packing...</i>
I've never had to stand
in front of anybody and do this
to save my career.
I have. It's hard.
<i>Until we go live in week 6</i>
<i>and you, America,</i>
<i>will get to vote.</i>
Whoo!
<i>These eight are gonna try</i>
<i>right now</i>
<i>this evening on...</i>

Kelly clarkson, everybody.
How about our superstars?
Amazing.
Picking up
right where they left off.
Well, thank you.
Welcome to "Duets."
This is where the superstars
are not just judging
the competition,
as you see,
they are in the competition.
My name is Quddus.
I'm your host.
And let's hear it
for those two superstars
who just brought down the house
with that performance...
Kelly clarkson
and Mr. Robin thicke.
And of course, taking it all in
from their superstar lounges,
there's John legend...
Thank you.
And over there,
we got the Southern belle...
miss Jennifer nettles.
As a reminder, here's how
it all goes down on "Duets."
Each week, our superstars will
perform alongside two amateurs
in a duet performance for you.
But before we get this
crazy night of music started,
let's take a look
at what happened last week
on this "Duets" stage.
♪ Tonight, tonight, tonight ♪
<i>Jennifer nettles</i>
<i>from super duo sugarland</i>
<i>found two partners...</i>
<i>One in her own backyard...</i>

that you sing in her church...
Oh, yeah?
And she loves it.
<i>Both staying near the top</i>

♪ always ♪
♪ you can't give me

♪ baby,

<i>John legend,</i>
<i>9-time grammy winner,</i>
<i>found</i>
<i>his diamond-in-the-rough voices</i>
<i>in the unlikeliest of places.</i>
I read in your bio that you're
a debt offset coordinator.
What is that?
When you don't pay your taxes,
I come get it.
♪ Baby, tonight ♪
♪ you need that ♪
Man, that... that song makes me
want to go to the club.
Me, too. Makes me want
to go home <i>after</i> the club.
♪ Tonight ♪
♪ baby ♪
<i>While R&B sensation</i>
<i>Robin thicke</i>
<i>electrified the stage.</i>
♪ We got the magic, yeah ♪
<i>And the ladies.</i>
♪ Lost without u ♪
This is a really nice song
you got there.
You should put
it out on the radio.
It might do pretty well.
Yeah. Right.
♪ Oh ♪
♪ what doesn't kill you
makes you stronger ♪
<i>But no one put their amateurs</i>
<i>to a bigger test</i>
<i>than pop idol Kelly clarkson.</i>
<i>She forced her hopefuls</i>
<i>to perform</i>
<i>in front of 6,000 people</i>
<i>on her concert tour.</i>
♪ You've been doing it
from the start ♪
Somebody took a confidence pill
over the past two days.
<i>But despite that,</i>
<i>both her partners</i>
<i>ended up as the bottom two.</i>
♪ Not alone ♪
As you can see, we've got
ourselves a competition,
and if all that wasn't enough,
we've got some major news about
one of our amateurs
that we'll reveal later
in the show,
but before we get
to any of that, Kelly,
I gotta come to you first
and talk about
how your amateurs had a bit
of a rough time last week.
Both of them ended up
in the bottom two.
So you obviously didn't agree
with it.
Yeah. Do you think that they're
gonna be able to step up this week?
You know, they did need
to bring their confidence up,
which I think they totally did
whenever they came to perform
actually onstage.
Like, during the rehearsals,
they were a little
not as confident as I wanted
them to be, and they did,
and yeah, no, I'm looking
forward to this show.
It's a brand-new show, so...
Absolutely. I think the
crowd is behind you. Yeah.
Tonight is a special night.
Our amateurs and superstars are
gonna tackle
some of the most famous Duets
in music history.
So here's how it's gonna work.
Our amateurs are gonna get
the first two weeks
to show us what they're made of
right here on this "Duets"
stage, and trust me,
each and every time,
they're gonna be
fighting for their lives,
making a name for themselves
on the "Duets" chart.
But because next week
one amateur is going home,
the stakes are
just getting higher.
Our first amateur is fighting to
make her presence felt tonight
for sure,
and it's bridget carrington.
After coming in at number 6
on the chart last week,
let's see
how John legend decided
to approach
this week's rehearsal.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey.
Hey. How you doing?
How are you?
Good.
Good to see you.
You, too. The first week, we
didn't do as well as we wanted to.
And I think a lot of that
goes to song choice.
Her voice sounded great,
but during the verses,
it was a little low for her.
♪ Come on, let me kiss that ♪
♪ ooh, I know you miss that ♪
♪ what's wrong?
Let me fix that ♪
♪ twist that ♪
This week we're singing
a song called
"I knew you were waiting."
It's, uh, originally done
by George Michael
and aretha Franklin.
We're filling
some big shoes here.
I feel like now
that I understand her voice
a little more,
I'm able to really highlight
the best parts of her voice,
and I think the second week
will even be better.
♪ Like a warrior that fights ♪
♪ and wins the battle ♪
♪ I know the taste of victory ♪
Yeah,
that's a good key for you.
My performance
on last week's show...
I was not 100% happy with it,
I mean,
definitely not my ranking,
but we've got a better song
this week,
and we're gonna move
right on up the charts.
♪ I didn't falter ♪
yeah. Do it.
♪ When the Mountain was high ♪
This week's song choice
with aretha Franklin
will definitely be a challenge,
but if I want it,
I gotta go for it.
I gotta step out on faith
and make it happen.
Sounds awesome.
I think that every approach
you're taking,
all the little runs you're doing
are really good. It's all good.
I was ready today.
Cool. Good work.
All right. Mm.
Good stuff.
We're gonna get to see
John and bridget
in our first duet of the night.
Also coming up later,
Kelly clarkson takes on "misery"
by p! Nk and Steven Tyler
and Jennifer nettles performs
"ain't no Mountain high enough."
You're watching "Duets" on abc.
Welcome back to "Duets."
We've got eight amateurs
that have been given
the chance of a lifetime...
to perform a duet with
our superstars each and every
week on this very stage,
and if that's not big enough,
well, there's also
a recording contract
from Hollywood records at stake.
Right now, starting us off
with the aretha Franklin
and George Michael duet hit.
"I knew you were waiting,"
here's John legend
and his first duet partner,
bridget carrington.

Bridget.
I love that song.
I do, too.
That's a feel-good song.
Yes, it is.
How good did you feel
singing that?
I feel <i>real</i> good.
Ooh! Yeah, it is
one of those things
where you wanna enjoy performing
with a guy like John legend,
but this is a competition.
So are you striking
that balance?
Are you managing
to keep that in mind?
I'm definitely keeping it in mind.
Okay.
I'm having a good time, and it's
also a little bit of a fight.
Okay.
Somehow I'm not intimidated
by that.
Out of her, it doesn't work.
All right, well, let's hear
from our superstars. Jennifer?
I loved it.
I thought it was fantastic.
I can definitely tell
the time that you've put in
since last week.
You're confidence level feels
much greater.
And this song, to me, feels like
it really fits in your voice
in a better way.
I thought it was.
Definitely, you raised the bar
on your own performance.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Yeah!
Kelly?
I thought you were fantastic.
All those runs you were doing?
<i>Whatever.</i>
That was really good.
 Thank you.
Yeah, that was really good.
It was tasteful and it was
classic. And that's a hard song.
I mean, aretha Franklin and
George Michael... Yeah.
That's a hard song,
and y'all nailed it.
Y'all did really good.
Thank you.
Robin?
Well, uh...
First of all, you look like
a bag of skittles,
and I love skittles.
- Uh...
-  Oh, my God.
But, uh,
what I will say is, uh,
you know, when you started out,
um, you... you know, when you...
when you're singing to John,
you guys have
such a beautiful chemistry,
and you... you know, you feel safe
when you're singing to John.
And then when you would
turn to the audience,
sometimes you'd
keep your eyes low
and you wouldn't quite look up.
And then all of a sudden
at the end of the song,
when you knew
it was almost over,
you started stomping your feet
and you started looking out
at everybody
and you gave
that incredible energy
that is supposed to happen,
and I think that, uh, you know,
I was really amazed
by how you finished the song,
and I think
what's most important
is always how you finish,
so I think you did a great job.
Okay.
By the way, let's all take note
of how much less clothing
Robin has on week after week.
Somehow, he's more naked
this week. I'm just saying.
All right, we've heard
from two of the stars.
Wait, wait, wait. Next week is
the speedo episode, right?
I was gonna say.
Wait till next week.
I'm not running with that memo,
but you can.
All right, now it's time
to rank bridget's performance.
And here's a reminder
on how the scoring works.
The three superstars
who didn't just perform...
in this case, Kelly,
Jennifer, and Robin...
and have entered a secret score
on their "Duets" tablet
between 1 and 100,
based upon performance
and presentation.
After each amateur performs,
we'll add up those scores
and reveal where they stand.
Okay, so we've heard what
the superstars have to say.
Let's see the scores
they locked in.
Bridget, let's take a look
at the "Duets" chart.
Whoo!
It's just a little bit
anticlimactic,
being as though she's
the first person to perform.
You get how the chart works,
right? Okay.
All right, you're obviously
gonna be on top for now,
but the true test will be
holding that spot throughout
the course of the night.
As our superstars are gonna
tell you, it is not easy, okay?
You can work your whole life to
get to the top of the charts...
Yeah. And in just one
week, you're gone.
So keep that in mind
and celebrate for now.
All right.
All right.
All right, let's hear it
one more time for bridget.
Best of luck holding
that number one spot.
You can head over
to the lounge.
Kelly clarkson
and Jordan Meredith perform
p! Nk and Steven Tyler's duet
"misery,"
and seven more amateurs gear up
to take the stage
with their superstar
by their side
and their futures on the line.
This is "Duets" on abc.
Welcome back, everybody,
to "Duets."
It's Quddus here with ya,
and we've got
music's biggest superstars
not only coaching the amateurs,
they're performing with them
each and every week
right here on the "Duets" stage.
And let me tell you, we are
just getting started tonight.
And up next,
let's take a look at how
this week's rehearsal went
for Kelly and her first
duet partner Jordan Meredith.
How you doin'?
- Good, good.
-  Great.
Liars.
Last week,
we did not do so well.
Jason and Jordan ended up
being in the bottom two.
I'm gonna be really blunt
with you.
I think everybody else has
way more experience.
I mean, and it shows because
they're out onstage
and they're... they're into it
and they're not nervous,
and I think that's the only
thing we need to focus on.
I don't agree with the results,
but we have no control
over that.
But what we have control over
is sounding awesome
on the next show.
Yep.
All right. Are you ready?
Yes.
♪ What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger ♪
♪ stand a little taller ♪
"Stronger's" not really
a duet. It's an anthem.
And Jordan has this thing
where she's just very soulful,
so she didn't really get enough
moments to shine and show
what she's really capable of
because it's an anthem.
♪ Shadows are fallin' ♪
♪ all over town ♪
She's very good at emoting pain
through her vocal cords,
and I wanted to pick a song
that I thought would
really showcase her
since she is in the bottom,
and we're trying to obviously
get her to the top.
♪ Guess it's all... ♪
no, wait.
♪ Meant to be ♪ no, no, no.
This ain't sweet.
This is miserable.
There's a lot on the line.
This week,
I really have to push it.
'Cause it's in there,
especially you going to that...
♪ destiny ♪
Or whatever you're doing.
That was crazy.
You went higher
than I wanted to you.
So I don't wanna hear
any of that crap anymore...
About how you
can't go high. Yeah.
Okay.
There are really high notes
I have to hit,
and if my nerves get the best
of me, it's gonna crash.
♪ Misery ♪
♪ yeah ♪ yeah!
Yeah!
I think I'm just nervous
and I can't let it go
because I know that there's
a lot on the line.
You sing the song really well.
Just remember...
you can't grin.
♪ Shadows are fallin' ♪
You can't do that. Unh-unh.
Are you good?
Yes.
- Okay. Confidence! Confidence!
- I can! I can!
If she does anything
like she just did today,
there's no way
she'll be in the bottom.
And if she is, I'm walking out.
Well, I don't want her to
walk out,
so let's all pray this is good.

I love that performance
because, ironically enough,
I am not feeling any misery
right now after watching that.
Good. Yeah.
So how did you feel,
especially after coming off
the last performance
of last week
and being in the bottom two?
Did you feel like
you had a lot to prove
and get that chip
on your shoulder?
Um, I did feel like
I had to prove a little bit,
just enough
to show you, like...
I got somethin'.
I can do it a little bit. Okay,
okay, that's an understatement.
That is an understatement,
girl.
All right, well, it's time
to hear from our superstars.
Jennifer?
You got more than somethin',
babe.
I'm... I'm so happy to hear
this song choice.
And I think all of us...
we had talked about how
really the challenge that it was
to choose our own songs and sing
our own songs in duet form.
This gives you an opportunity
to really showcase your voice,
in a way.
I love the soul that you have.
I love the grit
that you have on top.
I think it was fantastic,
and you really...
you really raised
your performance, for sure.
Oh, thank you so much.
So, Robin, you said last week
that Jordan was,
"a bubbly good time."
Yes.
Your words, not mine.
Yes, q... so what did you
think of this performance?
Well, obviously, the song
she sang with Kelly last week
was so much fun, you know.
But this is really, uh,
like Kelly knew
she picked the perfect song
for her voice
'cause she is so soulful.
And you wouldn't know it
from the pink hair, you know.
But, uh, I really feel like...
at the beginning of the song,
I feel like you were...
you were... y gave me the misery,
you needed the company.
Then the company showed up,
everything was wonderful.
And then...
Then when you... and then
when you got to the end,
there were those couple
big notes at the end
you know, it was really...
you were really close to it.
It didn't quite finish
as... as strong as you started.
But what a difference
from last week.
I finally knew... know
who you are, what you like,
and what you're all about.
So great... great choice.
Thank you. Thank you.
John?
I will say this...
I love your tone up top.
I think you have
a really strong, like,
powerful voice up top, and it
really sounds good up there.
I would say my only concern was
a little bit
on the side of precision.
There was some pitchiness,
and it just felt like sometimes
you could get all the way up
into that note
when you didn't always
get all the way up into it,
and that would be
my only concern.
And then also, when you're
performing with Kelly,
sometimes it looks like
you're using her as a crutch
a little bit,
and you just gotta...
Don't be worried about it.
Just go and do it, you know?
Thank you. Thank you. All right, well,
you've heard from our superstars.
Now the scores are locked in.
Let's find out your position
on the chart.
No.
Okay.
All right.
Yeah.
Kelly, do you think
that she redeemed herself
after last week?
Oh, my gosh. I think... w-what
Jennifer said is solid.
It's a solid point.
It's like... it was really hard
to make "stronger" a duet,
or any of my songs,
'cause they're such anthems,
and it just really, I think,
kind of clouded
what she's capable of.
And this was the first song
we've been able
to actually pull it out of her,
and the soulfulness
and everything.
And... and I agree,
and she knows it, you know.
She can be a lot more pow...
she has this thing about her.
She's like, "I can't. I can't."
And I'm like, "she's so great."
And I just want her to know that
and I want her to believe that.
And... and that was good advice.
That's good advice.
Absolutely.
Yeah, it was.
You can take that advice...
Oh, I will.
And head over to the lounge.
Let that marinate.
All right, on the other side
of the break,
it's Jennifer nettles
and John glosson's turn
to take the stage
with a classic from Marvin gaye.
You don't want to go anywhere.
You'e watching "Duets" on abc.
We are back here on "Duets."
I'm your host Quddus.
And before the break,
Jordan performed and moved
into the number two position
on our chart, with bridget
holding on at number one.
But then again,
there's only been two amateurs
to perform so far,
so it's still anybody's game.
Now this week, having to perform
one of the most renowned Duets
in music history
is really no small undertaking,
so let's take a look
at how things went down
for Jennifer and her first
duet partner John glosson
in their rehearsal.
How are you?
Good.
Good seeing you.
Now tell me how you're feeling
after last week.
Um, the energy of the crowd
was ridiculous.
♪ For mine ♪
♪ why don't you stay? ♪
I think John glosson did
a fantastic job,
and in my opinion,
was the top voice of the night.
I thought the voting was not as
accurate as it should have been.
Number three. Hey.
And clearly the audience agrees
with me on that.
Keep in mind, though,
that this is a competition,
and never underestimate
the insecurity and ego
of an artist.
So we will see
what kind of strategy
possibly gets played out.
<i>But</i> we're here in a new week...
Another week.
We gon' handle things with grace like we do.
Exactly. Exactly.
And we will go and give 'em
another reason to pay attention.
The song that I chose
for John glosson is
"ain't no Mountain high enough."
Can't go wrong with that,
can you? Listen, baby.
You cannot go wrong with
some Marvin gaye... Yeah.
And your voice, I-I know this.
Okay.
♪ Listen, baby ♪
♪ ain't no Mountain high ♪
♪ ain't no valley low ♪
♪ ain't no river wide enough,
baby ♪
Everyone in America
knows this song,
and they will relate it back
to the original artist,
and so I gotta make sure
that, you know,
I don't do anything stupid.
I know that John legend is
a Marvin gaye...
I mean, I'm a fan...
Yeah.
Fanatic? Okay. But he's... like,
he knows his stuff intimately.
John legend just did
a whole tribute show
of Marvin gaye's
"what's going on" record,
and he feels it's important
to really be respectful
to the melodies
that the writers have written.
Yes.
It's good to know
your competition.
There you go.
♪ Ain't no Mountain
high enough ♪
We are staying very close
to the original version
of the song.
So I'm gonna try to be John
but yet also respect the song,
and hopefully the outcome
will be amazing.
Thanks, boo. Sounds great.
Thank you. All right.
We're gonna get 'em.
We're gonna kill 'em.
Yes, we are.
Bye.
Bye.
Whoo!

Whoo!
Man!
Whoo!
You just had a great time
onstage.
Exactly.
Whoo!
Jennifer, did you expect
that much of a good time
out of him tonight?
Oh, listen, I said,
"we... we are not fixin'
to go into a gunfight with
a knife, brother. Bring it."
You know what I'm saying?
All right, so tell me
what that was like.
Because, you know,
that song's been performed
by some of the greats.
I mean, Marvin gaye, Diana Ross,
the temptations.
Was there any sort
of a build-up whatsoever?
It seems like you are
not nervous whatsoever.
Well, I mean, I'm singing
with Jennifer nettles now.
Sure. So, I mean,
what can you say?
I mean, some of the greats.
All right.
So there we go.
All right, well,
let's face up to
the superstars now
and see what they have to say
about that.
Uh, Kelly, last week, you said
he sings like an angel.
He does. Was that angelic?
How would you describe that?
No, no, I love that y'all did
something different.
I think that's so smart
on her part, too,
that you did something fast
and up-tempo.
And... and I love that y'all are
having such a great time.
That's awesome.
It kinda looks, uh, a little...
A little like...
or not hokey.
It's sometimes hard when you do
a, you know, song like that,
people tend to get
a little cheesy sometimes.
That was my only thing.
But vocally and, like,
your performance,
like, you are having
such a ball. I love it.
I love you. That's no secret.
I cried last time.
I... John, I think
you're so talented
and I think you're gonna go far
in this competition.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
I love <i>you.</i>
Robin?
Well, I, uh,
you know...  I like...
we all know that you have
an amazing voice.
Uh, I'm a h... I'm a...
Marvin gaye is
my favorite singer of all time,
so you're... you're...
you're standing up to a lot.
It's tough for me, you know.
Yeah.
But, uh, I-I honestly think
it was the wrong song.
I think that, uh, I think
that your voice...
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Boo!
Sorry. Sorry. My honest opinion.
I'm allowed to it.
Uh, I-I think that your voice
is so beautiful,
and I felt like...
I agree with Kelly
that some of the movements
started to become, like,
you had started to copy some
of... some of Jennifer's moves.
And what's wrong with that?
And they were...
I got some moves.
They look a little different
on a man, though.
Oh, really?
They look a little different
on a man.
You know what I'm saying?
So all I would say is...
is at the end,
when you just started going
left and right,
and you were just in that groove
left to right,
it was real simple... I tell my
friends... I'm like, "when y'all...
"if y'all go to the club
and you hit the dance floor,
guys, don't try too hard
on the dance floor."
You know what I'm saying?
Step, touch.
So I felt like, you know,
because you were having
such a great time,
I felt like maybe you jumped out
of your comfort zone
a little bit physically.
But, uh, I think your voice
is incredible,
and I do think you gonna go
a long way in the competition.
Thank you.
So, John,
you've obviously...
you've gotten a lot
of Marvin gaye comparisons.
First of all, John,
you are one of the best singers
in this competition.
You sounded wonderful.
Thank you.
You have... you have
a phenomenal voice.
I think my only, uh, complaint
would be similar
to what Robin's was.
I think the energy of the song,
you kinda took it somewhere
that made it feel
a little Broadway-ish too me,
uh, in some of the moves, in
some of the delivery you made.
So it's just
a matter of choices,
and you'll get better
and better.
But you're awesome,
so... congratulations.
- You are.
-  Thank you.
All right, so we've heard
from our superstars.
Now the scores are locked in.
John, let's see where
you ended up on the chart.
All right.
Jumped over Jordan,
got the number two spot.
That's success, my friend.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Head over to the lounge.
Robin thicke
goes looking for love
and takes the stage
for the very first time tonight.
You're watching "Duets" on abc.
Welcome back to "Duets,"
the show where the superstars
aren't just judging
the competition.
They're <i>in</i> the competition.
And tonight is
a very special night
because our superstars
are singing
the greatest Duets of all time
alongside their amateurs.
Up next, let's take a look
at Robin's rehearsal
with his first duet partner
Olivia chisholm.
Hello.
How you doing today?
Good. How about yourself?
You look great.
Thank you.
Um, the song we're gonna do
this week
is "where is the love"
by, uh, Donny hathaway
and Roberta flack.
It's a classic soul/r&b song.
Okay.
I never heard
of the song before.
I'm very nervous
'cause I don't know the song
as well as everyone else
knows their song.
You and I obviously have, like,
a sensual type of attraction.
Do you know what I mean?
Mm-hmm.
So we wanna try
to turn that into something
where you look like you love me,
then you look like you hate me.
Yeah. Like, I wanna add
some tension to the song.
Okay. You know, tension
and release, I think,
is one of the keys
to any great performance.
I picked this song for Olivia
because it has such a romance
and such a push and pull.
♪ Where is the love? ♪
♪ where is the love? ♪
My wife... sometimes
when her and I are having
little play fights,
she'll start walking around
the house singing...
♪ Where is the love? ♪
And giving me the cold shoulder.
So really
just practice it endlessly,
and then once you have
the lyric memorized,
which is first priority...
don't even worry about moving
until you have the lyric memorized.
Okay.
Then just start sashaying
around the room,
throwing attitude to the mirrors.
Okay.
I'm just trying to get her to
just take control of that stage
and <i>use</i> your beauty.
You know, use what God gave you.
Get the lyrics memorized tonight.
All right. Got it.
Okay. You were great today.
All right, thank you.
Mwah. See you later.
All right.
I really wanna show Robin that
I can pick up the song fast,
and I'm gonna use
all his advice to learn
and just to do what I have to do
when I get onstage.
♪ Oh, how I wish
I never met you ♪
♪ I guess it must have been
my fate ♪
♪ to fall in... ♪
♪ mm... else's love ♪
You're supposed to know them.
That's why I told you, you gotta
memorize the lyrics...
Yeah. The first thing... you
can't focus on your pitch.
You can't focus
on your presentation
until you know the words,
you know?
You got one song.
I got three songs to learn.
Okay.
Robin was annoyed that
I brought in the lyric sheet,
but it's very hard for me
to remember lyrics.
Right now we could be focused
on learning our movements
and getting our pitch in tight,
but we're still focusing on
remembering the words and where
you're supposed to sing.
I could know a song by heart
when I'm listening to it,
but once I have to sing it,
I just freeze.
I really need you to do
more homework.
It just seems like you didn't
do it last night.
Yeah. No, I did.
You did? Yes? You promise?
I'm just bad at...
I'm bad at lyrics, yeah.
Okay.
That's all.
This is the crunch time.
This is serious.
You know, I can mess up
and get away with it.
She can't make a big mistake
like forgetting the lyrics.
She's gonna have to nail it.

Thank you.
Robin, Olivia.
I definitely love
that last high note you hit.
Thank you.
That was beautiful.
How did you feel up there?
It felt good. It seemed like you were
just breezing on through that song.
Yeah. All right, let's hear
what the superstars have to say
about your performance.
John?
I love your presence onstage.
You just look really comfortable
and sexy and sultry.
Thank you.
It really, really looked great.
I loved you
and Robin's chemistry.
Uh, it's funny
that he mentioned the lyrics
'cause you all had a lyric
moment at the end, I think.
Yeah. That was me.
I was wondering
if it was your fault, Robin.
No, it was... it was my fault.
She was fine. I messed it up.
But it was lovely. Great job.
Thank you.
Awesome. Jennifer,
what'd you think of that?
I thought it was
a great performance.
I feel that there were
a couple of things pitchy
that I heard here, there.
Part of that, to me, felt like
confidence, I think.
Okay.
Um, a-and I-I won't throw you
under the bus
for your, um, partner's choices
like he threw my artist
under the bus,
but I will say I-I feel like
for example,
the songs last week
really showcased your voice
in a better way than this week.
Okay. Thank you.
Fair enough.
Okay. Kelly?
Uh, I just, I don't know,
I guess I thought it was funny
because the lyrics are just
"where is the love,"
like, a thousand times.
So... and everybody was like,
oh, God, remember the lyrics,
and I'm like...
♪ where is the love ♪
It's like, that's, like,
the whole song, y'all.
She knows it already.
I'm like...
That's
a great question though.
I mean,
somebody had a good night.
It was like, this is amazing,
this song.
Like, it was, like, what?
I don't know.
I think it's funny.
But I think you sing...
I mean, your voice...
that's a very cool texture
to your voice.
It's, like, um,
it's... no, I don't know any
other girl that has your voice.
Thank you.
Like, it's just such a-a cool...
a cool texture. I just... I gotta
agree with her a little bit.
I didn't love the song,
but that's just h-honestly
my own personal taste.
I just feel like it could've
maybe been a better song maybe.
Okay. But... but your perfor...
I-I do love your voice.
I want you to know that. I think it's
special, very special. Thank you. Thank you.
Absolutely. That's
good feedback, for sure.
Yeah. Yeah. So we've heard
from the superstars.
Now the scores are locked in.
Olivia, it's time to find out
where your position on the chart is.
Okay.
Okay.
All right, you can join Robin
over in the superstar lounge now.
Thank you.
We got John legend
taking the stage one more time,
but his duet partner is not
who you're expecting.
Find out why after the break.
You're watching "Duets" on abc.
Welcome back to "Duets,"
where our theme tonight is
classic Duets.
Half of our amateurs have
already taken the ste,
and we've got four more
anxiously awaiting their turn.
Now as you may have noticed,
Johnny gray is absent
from John legend's
superstar lounge tonight.
Due to unforeseen circumstances,
Johnny gray is no longer
in the competition.
So for Mr. legend, that meant
finding a new duet partner
and rehearsing
on incredibly short notice.
Well, I lost one
of my contestants.
I had to find a replacement
quickly.
So I decided that, uh,
we'd do an open call.
Whoo!
We had, uh, hundreds of people
out there waiting in line.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
All right now.
Listen up. Listen up.
Thanks for being here.
Y'all ready to go?
Let's go.
All right.
We had to kind of do
a rapid-fire audition
because we had a lot of people
and we didn't have
a lot of time.
Hello.
So I just brought in groups
of five and said, "sing."
♪ You ♪
Thank you.

♪ Oh ♪

And then I narrowed it down
to two people
that I thought were awesome.
All right. Welcome back.
Hey.
Yeah, thank you.
So you guys are
my favorite two.
So this presents
a dilemma for me
'cause I have to decide
between the two of you
and I can only pick one,
but I don't want
to make that decision
based on today's audition.
So I want to give you
an opportunity to learn a song
and we're going to try
and duet tomorrow.
And then, uh, whoever I feel
most confident about,
we're gonna go on the show
together,
and the show's the next day.
Wow. No big deal.
No big deal.
My mind exploded.
It was like, pfft! What?
Like, <i>John legend</i>
just said that I have 24 hours
to learn a song.
So I'm gonna really focus
tomorrow
and just pour my soul
onto the stage.
You'll be on national TV
in less than 48 hours from now.
I have a song
that I have to learn
and perform it tomorrow
with John.
Thanks.
Thank you, John.
Thank you very much.
All right.
My nerves will probably
just keep me up all night.
But regardless,
I'm ready to sing.
No pressure.
No pressure.
Yeah, none at all.
I want them to prove
first of all,
that they can learn a song
pretty quickly,
perform under pressure, and then
that they'll sound good with me,
'cause I want to beat
Jennifer's people,
I want to beat Kelly's people,
I want to beat Robin's people,
and I want to pick the partner
that's gonna best equip me
to do that.
You study last night?
Oh, gosh.
This morning, too.
This morning, too.
So you ready to try it?
Let's do it.
Let's try it.

But by the end of the rehearsal
I felt very confident
that we could give a great
performance together onstage.
Hey.
There he is.
How's it going?
How you doing, sir?
Good. Good.
How about yourself?

They both did a great job,

I give Mario a lot of points for

So...
Is this tripping you out yet?
Just three days ago...
What were you doing
three days ago,
in comparison to this?
Nothing.
In comparison to this.
Chillin' on your couch, huh?
That's right.
Describe... 'cause I know it's all
rushing in your head right now...
just see if you can settle into
what it was like
to sing with John legend
just now,
if you could put it in words.
Oh, my goodness. I definitely
couldn't... cannot put into words.
This is just so unreal
to me right now.
I'm still in a dream,
to be honest with you.
All right. It's very real. And
it's a dream come true, too, so...
I'm a very sane individual,
so let me just tell you,
it is very real.
It's happening. It's really happening.
Thank you.
All right, so it's time
to face the superstars.
What did you think about
that performance?
Robin, I go to you first.
You know when you get a sandwich
and it's got too much onion,
not enough mustard,
and they forget the cheese?
Well, your sandwich had
the perfect amount of onion,
definitely not too much mustard,
and you even put some provolone
on there for me. Thank you.
And now you made me hungry.
Who's writing this stuff?
I-I honestly... welcome...
welcome to the show.
It's an amazing song and you guys sounded
beautiful together. Thank you. Thank you.
Great job. My favorite.
Kelly.
<i>What?</i>
That's not
a sandwich metaphor.
Oh, my God. It was amazing.
I'm always hungry.
Okay. That was amazing.
Um, I was like, you know, it was
like, you know when someone's
telling a story and you're like,
where? Come on. Come around.
Where's it coming?
Where's it coming around?
That was awesome.
That's awesome.
Um, I love you. This...
welcome to the show.
Thank you so much for joining
us, and you couldn't have picked
a more beautiful partner,
good gosh.
And, uh, I just... I just want
to say, it is our first time,
so I'm not even gonna judge you
that harshly.
I mean, 'cause you did such...
I'm not gonna judge anybody
that harshly,
but I just mean like,
you know, it's your first time
to be onstage with him,
and I think you did a great job.
My only thing with...
and the only reason why
I say that is I used to
be like this, too... sometimes
we get so technically perfect,
we're trying to do every note
so perfectly
that we sometimes lose
the soul of it.
And I think that you got a lot
of soul there 'cause I heard it.
Don't try and be so perfect
all the time
just because heart
matters way more
than the right,
perfect pitch note, you know?
The technical singers are good,
but they're not
the great ones, you know?
Mm-hmm.
And I think that you...
I think you are totally capable.
I think you are.
It's kinda like
a cinderella moment.
Rit? She looks a little bit
like cinderella right now.
Just saying.
Jennifer.
What a whirlwind, first of all,
you must be on right now.
I cannot imagine. And to come
out here on the stage,
on national television,
after just 48 hours' notice
and to hold yourself with
the composure that you did
and be standing here,
first of all,
I would say first impressions
for me, overall and vocally...
there is something super classy
about what you're doing,
and it may be just
the great song choice, too,
but I feel like it is really,
yeah, really classy,
and I also could hear
some uniqueness in your voice
where you did make it yours
even though you paid
great homage to the lady Ross.
So I-I thought
it was fabulous.
Thank you. Thank you.
All right.
So the superstars said
lovely things.
Let's reveal your position
on the chart.
Shot right up to the top.
Ooh.
Okay.
Well, John,
all things considered,
it seems like
you made a good pick.
I feel good.
I got a good team now.
I'm ready.
You can go over to the lounge
now. Thank you so much.
Thank you. Thank you. You're
definitely welcome to the show.
We've got three more superstars
that'll take the stage
with their amateurs,
and one takes on
a 1978 John Travolta
and Olivia Newton-John classic
"you are the one that I want."
This is "Duets" on abc.
We're back on a very special
night on "Duets,"
where our superstars
and amateurs are singing
the greatest Duets of all-time.
Our amateurs are gonna get
the first two weeks
to show us what they're made of,
but remember,
at the end of next week,
one of our amateurs
will be going home.
Right now on our chart,
we have meleana
living like a fairy tale,
catapulting straight to the top
after an incredibly strong
first rformae.
And up next, we got kellyand ja.
After finding himself
at the bottom...
Again he filled the crowd
with his family. Amazing.
Well, he found himself
at the bottom of the chart
last week, so let's see if Jason
was able to turn things around
in this week's rehearsal.
All right. Are you ready?
Ready.
For Jason to get out
of last position,
he's gonna need to
not be nervous.
♪ I won't ever be ♪
I'm not used to performing.
I've been hiding it a lot 'cause
it's really shy about singing.
Hey. Was that part
you or me... um...
♪ We can only turn ♪
You know what? I don't know,
but you should take it anyway.
Okay. This is your... this
is your moment to shine.
You're bottom. Like, so whatever
you got in that arsenal... Mm-hmm.
Bring it on out.
I definitely think Kelly is
working real hard this week
because she wants us to go
really far in the competition.
We gotta make sure
that "I" is huge.
Yeah. Yeah. She's been pulling
out all the tricks in the book.
She's been in a competition
like this before,
so she knows when to bring in
and, like, what to do
and what not to do.
I think the only thing we need
to focus on for this week...
just performance. I want
you to let go... Yeah.
And really be into the song
and not be nervous about it.
Mess it up, but sing out.
♪ Ah ♪
If he gets his confidence, man,
his voice is beautiful.
That's what's upsetting, like,
he's not taking advantage
quite yet of... of, you know,
all he is capable of.
♪ And I will pray
for you each day ♪
♪ comfort you
through all the pain ♪
You know, he'll have no reason
to not be comfortable.
He knows the song, so hopefully,
he... he commands the stage.
You start swaying
when you feel uncomfortable
and you don't know what to do,
so I think it would be cool
if you just kind of walking out and
have some swagger. Yeah. Yeah.
You could sing the best song
in the whole world
and sing it the greatest
you possibly can,
but if you're not commanding
the stage, you're not gonna
get out of the bottom two,
so I'm trying
to work it out with him.
If you ever get nervous
and you don't know what to do out
there, look at me. Yeah. Yeah.
I've only been here
for such a short while
and I have a lot more to show.
With the more experience I get,
the less nervous I'll be.
Time to get the swag up, j.

Jason!
Jason! Jason! Jason! Jason!
Jason! Jason! Jason!
Jason! Jason! Jason!
Okay. Okay.
Okay. Okay. Okay.
I like that. Hold on.
Let me just get something
for you real quick here.
Time to get the dirt
off your shoulders, brother.
All right,
it had to be tough though,
coming out here after last week
being down at the bottom.
What was going through your mind
this week?
Um, I don't know, it wasn't fun
being eighth place,
but I just had to have fun
and be confident again,
and I think I did that.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Is that your father?
Is that your father?
That's my brother.
All right. All right. It's time
to talk to the superstars
about what they think
about that performance. John?
Well, I thought it was...
it was good.
Now my issue I think,
with the way you're performing
with Kelly...
it seems so much like you're
looking to her for approval, um,
whereas it doesn't feel like
you're owning it yourself.
It looks like you're kinda
like... it's almost like
the umbilical cord, you know,
is attached and you feel...
I'm sorry.
It's his family.
Don't worry about it.
It's his cousins. I know
he's got a home crowd here.
I'm sorry. I'm gonna be hated
today in this building,
but, you know, I just feel like
you have to open up
to the audience a little bit
more and let us feel you
and not just connect with Kelly.
Okay?
That's good feedback,
right? Yeah.
Constructive criticism.
Robin, lay it on us. Talk about
some sandwiches or something.
Well, uh, first of all,
uh, you know,
I don't... some people know
where I live,
so I'm not gonna stay nothing
about, uh, about him.
But no, no, honestly, it was...
it was a big difference
from last week, man.
I-I could see you...
- especially when... when... and I think I...
-  Whoo!
Yeah. Yeah.
And what... what John...
what John said is
as soon as you stepped away
from Kelly,
that's when you exploded to me,
you know what I mean?
And I think once you realize
you... you can do it on your own
and you're good enough
on your own,
that's when it...
it really happens.
I think you gotta keep believing
it. Just keep believing it.
Thank you.
Yeah.
My fault.
That's kind of my fault.
Jennifer. There are a
couple of points so far
that I definitely agree with.
I can definitely, as Robin said,
I can see the confidence,
and I can see growth
from last week. Um, I think
there were a couple of things,
accuracy-wise. There were
a couple things pitch-wise,
but just like John said,
when you hit those big notes
and you're solid and you're,
like, really giving it,
it sounds really great.
If I had to give one, like,
actual note
of... of constructive...
that might be helpful,
in some of the movement,
I feel like this part
of your body is kinda tight.
I know that sounds weird,
but maybe it... maybe it might be
a helpful exercise
whenever y'all are rehearsing
together.
I mean, I don't mean
to be giving tips.
You know, this is a competition.
Oh. Okay. It is a competition,
so I... you know what I'm saying.
But I-I really do. I feel like
if there's just movement,
why something there, 'cause I
feel like there's a little bit
of nerves here. You know why? He
doesn't even know how sexy he is.
He doesn't know that.
Yes, he is!
See? Shy.
Yeah.
You need to bring the sexy,
Jason. Come on!
That's exactly what I was
just thinking, Jason.
Sexy.
All right, we've heard
from our superstars.
The scores are locked in.
Jason, let's find out where
you stack up on the chart.
All right.
So you're still down there,
but you're not getting
eliminated this week.
That's the good news.
My man.
All right. Head over
to the superstar lounge.
How will Jennifer and j. Rome do
when they take on one
of the most recognizable
duet classics of all-time?
You're gonna see
after the break.
Thank you and welcome back
to the "Duets" stage.
And we are down to our final two
Duets of the night.
And up first, after last week's
chart-topping performance,
let's see how j. Rome handled
his rehearsal with Jennifer.
What's up, Mr. number one?
I know. Right?
For j. Rome, I chose
"you're the one that I want"...
I do love that.
An iconic duet
that not only does everyone know
but everyone loves and enjoys.
Here we go. ♪ I got chills ♪
♪ They're multiplyin' ♪
♪ and I'm losin' control ♪
I must say though I am, uh,
a little nervous about it.
It could be really good
or it could be really corny
'cause it's, like,
it's a show tune, you know?
Big risk, big reward. All right.
We're going for the big reward here.
All right.
No, I agree. It is... it is
a song from a musical, so...
but I think we're gonna
pull it off and make it cool.
I thought doing this song would
be a bit of a surprise
to see j. Rome in this light.
Then they're gonna be like,
holy crap.
I cannot believe that
they're doing this song.
Because they know from last week
what he can do vocally.
♪ I think about it ♪
♪ always ♪
Wow!
I trust Jennifer 100%.
She told me that she had faith
and belief in me
that I could pull this off
because she felt
that I was a strong performer.
You sound great, babe.
Yes!
So good.
And to have somebody
like Jennifer
say that she believes in me,
especially after all the times
that people have said "you're
not gonna make it," you know,
it's an amazing,
amazing feeling.
It's a dope feeling.
Ah.
Thank you so much. Ah.
Thank you, baby.
I'm gonna make Jennifer proud.
I'm gonna make my mom proud.
I'm gonna make my family proud.
I'm gonna make me proud.
Performing one
of the best-selling singles
of all-time, the John Travolta
and Olivia Newton-John classic

Oh, my.
You wanna... you wanna put
your leg back on him?
Is that what you're saying?
My heart is in my...
That was a lot up there.
Yeah. You made it work.
You make it work.
My heart is in my...
Take a deep breath.
Take a deep breath.
Or as Jennifer would do,
do all this, you know.
Okay. Yeah. Roll that. Catch your breathe.
Whoo!
Um, I'm gonna throw you
a curveball
because I feel like you're in a
pretty comfortable zone. Okay.
Uh, you are probably
the most polished...
Amateur that we have here.
Do you think,
in a competition like this,
that's gonna help you
or hurt you?
Um, honestly,
I think it has the potential
to do both.
Mm.
Um, because obviously,
all the other contestants are
amazing vocally.
Um, every day
that I see them up here,
I get, like, I'm proud,
you know what I mean?
And they get, like,
better and better,
and it just makes me happy,
so, um,
but for me, I mean,
I feel like...
and no disrespect to
any of the other competition...
but I don't look at it
as a competition,
um, because I feel like
I am my biggest comp...
competition because
there can't be another me.
So if I try to be better
than I was last week,
than I feel good, no matter
where I stand on the charts.
There you go!
That's one
of the most thoughtful answers
I've ever seen
on a show like this.
All right, well,
let's hear what our superstars
thought about your performance
while Jennifer still catches
her breath, Kelly.
I'm still...
Um...
No, I gotta be honest...
Jennifer... she first... and I
actually heard her in the room
earlier say that y'all are
gonna do this,
and I was like, whoo!
That could be good or bad.
I was like... 'cause everybody
loves that song,
but that could go cheesy
real quick.
And actually, I think...
I thought you had swagger.
You looked like
little Bruno Mars up there.
You made that cool. Yeah. No,
that was... yeah.
It was good.
Thank you.
My only thing... my only thing
with the song, though...
I love that song... is it doesn't
really have a huge range
for you to have to... which I did
think at the very, very end,
whenever you were like,
but wait. I got this. Whoo!
Whatever you did,
like, that was awesome,
but, you know, throughout
the whole song, just...
I don't think
it's really as challenging maybe
as the last song
that I saw you on,
so I thought that was
more impressive,
but I thought that
you totally made that cool.
That was really cool. Yeah.
Thank you.
Yeah.
John?
You are such a natural onstage.
It's really impressive
to watch you do this.
Uh, like he said,
you're polished.
You look like a pro already
with the way you carry yourself.
All that is really awesome.
I think song choice... you know,
I don't think it showed off
your voice very much.
We couldn't really tell if you
were a great singer off of that,
but I saw that last week,
so hey, you were
an awesome performer today.
It was incredible.
Thank you. Thank you.
Robin.
Well, uh,
you know, first of all, uh,
you get a ten for, uh,
for your... your presence,
and a ten for your pelvic
thrusting, which is...
And I practiced that
really good.
And he's an expert
on the matter. Saying a lot.
Yeah. I-I specialize in it.
But, uh...
Oh, my God.
The song, you know,
the song is from a movie,
uh, about 25-year-olds
who, uh, you know,
who fly off into the sky
in a white convertible
at the end,
so I didn't quite get
that feeling at the end
of flying off into the sky
in the white convertible,
but I will say that, uh,
I-I think that you... you have
nothing to worry about
because you have a-a great
chance to win this whole thing
and start your record career.
You're amazing.
Thank you very much.
All right. Great feedback.
Now let's see
what they locked in
as scores for you on the chart.
You are tied with meleana.
Oh. Oh, all right.
Hey, that's good tie.
Right there on top.
Tied for first.
That's pretty awesome. Yeah, you
can feel real good about that.
Why don't you just go ahead
and dance your way
to the lounge there?
Alexis foster takes the stage
with Robin thicke
for the final duet of the night.
You will not want
to miss this finale.
You're watching "Duets" on abc.
Welcome back to "Duets."
Right now we have a tie
at the top of the chart
between meleana and j. Rome,
with Olivia at the bottom.
And last but not least, we got
Robin and Alexis foster's turn,
so let's check out
how they fared in rehearsal.
What's up?
How you doing?
I'm good.
Good. You look great.
Thank you. Um, obviously, we
know, uh, where we're you're at.
You did... you did great,
you're at number three, which is
great for the first show.
Alexis, as we know, hashis
effortless ability to sing.
♪ And I can make right now
all right ♪
But she's got to embrace
the feeling that the music
gives you.
You know, you want to make
eye contact with the audience
and people that are
in the audience
to share that moment,
but... but a lot of it is about
singing to everyone everywhere.
When Robin's onstage,
he's all about the charisma
and he's all, like, wink at you.
I do not feel like I have
any stage charisma at all.
So that's just something that
he's trying to bring out of me.

it'll bring the physical

Whoo.
Oh, Alexis, can I dance
with you now?
Yeah. Come on.
Whoo!
Girl, you did it!
She has some sway.
I love that.
So tell me about that sway.
Just... just how much rehearsal
did that entail?
Uh, we saw some of it.
We saw some of his coaching.
Oh, it's not really coaching.
You just have to let go.
You just have to feel it, you know?
Mm-hmm.
It was just one word.
Just, "let go."
"Let go." Well, two.
Two words, actually.
Oh! Two! Oh.
That's... that's two words.
- She's so in the moment, she's...
- "Ohh!"  Two words.
"Leggo" is one word.
It's two.
It's amazing. She is letting go...
Hey, I graduated. I'm...
of all sense.  I'm... I'm
done with school. Done.
That's amazing, though.
Congratulations on that performance.
Thank you.
I really enjoyed that.
Thank you.
All right, so now let's face up
to the superstars and see
what they thought. Jennifer?
That song is such
a smooth song anyway,
I thought you really added
to that element.
I was so happy en you started
coming around the piano,
'cause I was like,
"please tell me she's not
just gon' stand there
the whole time,"
because I really wanted,
you know,
from a presentation standpoint,
to see that,
so I loved that you did that.
I loved the interplay.
There were a couple of times
where you were like,
"mm-hmm," giving it
to him this way,
and I loved, you know,
that you guys came down.
Presentation-wise,
I thought it was great.
Vocally, I thought you did
this song very much justice
I thought it was
a wonderful performance.
Thank you.
John?
You have a wonderful voice.
You looked really comfortable
up there.
I have a minor technical point,
which actually affects
how we hear you.
You gotta hold the mic
to your mouth,
because you were doing it
kinda like this,
and it kinda didn't catch
everything you would say,
and, like, especially
on some of the lower notes,
where you're not s...
especially loud,
I didn't hear some of it...
Right.
And you were holding it
kinda like that,
so make sure...
Okay. Got you. It's up
there, so we can hear you.
Right here, loud and clear.
Y'all hear me?
Yes.
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
All right!
She got some sass!
I love this girl. Kelly.
I kinda disagree
on the presentation thing.
I thought
it was... really disconnected.
Like, and not so much
just your just him.
I just feel like
it was kinda like...
it didn't feel like a duet.
It felt like he was, like,
playing and singing sometimes,
and then, like,
you'd kinda walk around...
I'm sorry. I love you.
No, that's fine.
I just... I just thought
it was, like, very disconnected
as, uh, as a duet
until the very end on that...
♪ Howdy, howdy, howdy ♪
That part. Like, that was...
that was awesome,
but that was, like,
the last three notes,
like, so I thought,
I don't know,
I just felt it was
a little bit of a disconnect.
Okay. Well, it seems like
it's your opportunity
to kinda piece together
everything.
You've kinda taken it
one step at a time.
You've incorporated
his mic note.
You got the swayin' now...
Right.
And now if you can get the dynamics...
I think it'll be beautiful.
Okay.
We're gonna find out exactly
where Alexis stands
on the final chart of the night
that's all revealed
after the break.
This is "Duets" on abc.
All right.
Welcome back to "Duets."
Before the break,
Alexis foster here closed out
our "Duets" performances
in style,
and right now
we're gonna find out
where our superstars placed her
and reveal the final chart
of the night,
and remember,
at the end of next week,
one of our amateurs will be
going home.
That means a solid showing
on our chart tonight
will send a message
to the superstars that,
elimination or not,
you mean <i>business,</i> okay?
Okay.
So with that said,
Alexis, let's find out
where your position is
on the chart.
All right.
Well, you know what?
You got some great feedback
about the mic,
about connecting
with your partner,
so you can run with that
next week.
Okay. Thank you.
Thank you so much, Alexis.
All right, so, superstars,
now that you've had the chance
to see two weeks' worth
of performances
from our amateurs,
how do you think they've
done so far? Kelly?
Especially,
comparatively speaking,
to other shows, like, it's just
a lot of pressure, you know,
so I think... I'm just trying
to, like...
Do the best I can
for my people, so...
Robin, would you give them
any kind of advice
going into this next week?
I think, uh,
I-I'm just enjoying
uh, the whole opportunity
to just, uh, you know,
to... to give these girls a shot
and to sing onstage
and get...
and I get a free concert
with, uh, John and Kelly
and Jennifer every show,
so, uh, this is great for me.
That's right. All right.
Thank you for watching "Duets,"
and also a big shout-out
to John beasley
and the "Duets" band.
The amateurs are just starting
to hit their stride,
and the competition is
heating up.
Be sure to tune in next week
on Thursday at 8:00,
7:00 central,
as two of our amateurs
face elimination
in our first-ever
"Duets" showdown.
You will not want to miss this.
We'll see you then.
Good night, everybody.
