No.
--Details of the brutal slaying
of Page Forrester
at the Forrester's Baker Beach
retreat are still sketchy.
Her husband, John C. Forrester,
has been rushed to St. Paul's Clinic.
--Times-Lofton Publishing empire,
founded by her grandfather in 1876.
She was a prominent socialite--
I'm District Attorney Krasny.
Yes, sir, Mr. Krasny.
What are you doing outside?
Needed air.
You got a lot of headlines in there.
It's a forced rear-entry
window at the back.
We're upstairs.
It's the maid.
Consuela Martinez.
That's Page Forrester.
Christ.
We got multiple
stab wounds.
The wounds are jagged.
The blade must have
some serration.
I'll know much more tomorrow.
Cause of death is obvious.
Where was Forrester?
Over here.
He comes in, he gets hit, blacks out.
He comes to
and goes upstairs and finds them.
And saw what?
The bodies.
Where is he now?
St. Paul's Clinic.
There he is.
Mr. Krasny, was she raped?
Is it a ritual killing?
Were they both stabbed?
We have no comment.
Mr. Krasny--
We have no comment.
- Oh, give us something.
No sign of sperm.
No evidence
of any real sexual pattern,
apart from the specific wounds
we found on the wife.
The knife used
was a heavy blade,
6 inches long
with a serrated upper edge.
I'm betting a hunting knife.
The rope you could buy
at any Safeway.
There were no prints found except
Forrester's, his wife's and the maid's.
The blood on Forrester's clothes was
that of the wife's, but not the maid's.
What about his head wound?
No concussion.
Some bleeding.
Blunt object.
Come on, Al.
You know what I'm asking you.
Possibly self-inflicted.
Got it. Everything was in her name.
The corporate stuff,
the personal stuff, everything.
I mean,
she owned the guy.
He was an employee,
and you know what? He gets it all.
Jack Forrester
is the direct beneficiary
of all of Page Forrester's corporate
and personal assets.
You really think
he could've done that
to his own wife?
What the hell is that, you murder
your wife to take the money?
That is the oldest crime in the world.
Only you're real smart,
so you make it look like some
fucking Charlie Manson did it.
You want people to say,
"You think he could've
done that to his own wife?"
If l was gonna kill my wife,
that's the way I'd do it.
Mr. Forrester, why didn't you go out
to the beach house with your wife?
I had dinner
at the Union Club,
then I went back to
the paper and checked
on the Sunday editorials.
You don't write those
yourself, do you?
I didn't think editors wrote
their own editorial.
Sometimes they do.
Did you write the ones about me?
Yes, l insisted on writing all of those.
Is that relevant here?
The editorials I wrote
on Mr. Krasny.
I was just going to object to that.
Objection sustained.
I was just curious,
that's all.
Page was a woman of great
generosity and compassion.
I think the thing I'll miss
about my sister the most
is her great sense of resolve.
Page always did
whatever she set out to do.
I'll miss her more
than I know how to say.
Thank you.
Nice service.
Krasny.
Now?
Yes.
He's gonna ride my ass
into the Senate.
He can't do that, you're innocent.
The fuck he can't.
You've been coming here
for weeks,
putting the best apples
on top of the barrel.
I'm not buying it.
You say you were happy?
You ever argue? Any problems?
We've been over
and over this.
And we're gonna go over it again
and again and again.
Frank, there's no need
to badger Mr. Forrester.
Right, counselor?
I'm not trying
to get you to admit
you whacked your wife
around on a daily basis.
I wanna know
if you ever argued.
I never said
we didn't have arguments.
So you argued.
What did you argue about?
I told you. I told you,
we had the usual arguments.
We were married.
Mr. Arnold needs to speak to you.
I thought you had
the only perfect marriage
in the state of California.
Fine, Mr. Fabrizi, let's get back
to the bit about the lockers.
The club gives me a passkey,
so l go through them.
The members don't even know
I been there.
I seen all their stuff,
their rubbers and everything.
So that's when l saw it.
The knife?
Yeah, the knife.
When did you see it?
When?
Right after New Year's last year.
They like me to go in
at the beginning of the year
and clean them out.
Start the year off
with clean assholes,
right? Excuse me.
They let you clean out
private lockers?
They trust me.
I've been working
for them for 20 years.
Mr. Fabrizi,
what kind of knife did you see?
A hunting knife, about 6 inches long,
with a jag on the edge.
How'd you know
it was Forrester's locker?
Because it was numbered 122,
and that's his number.
Right after I saw it
I thought to myself:
"Jeez, I didn't know
Mr. Forrester was a hunter."
So it kind of made me feel good,
you know?
That he was a hunter.
You know what I mean?
Yeah, l know what you mean.
I'm getting tired of this, Andrew.
- Admit it. She owned you.
I'm getting tired of this.
- We're all getting tired of it.
We've been doing this too long.
I had no quarrel with the financial
structure of the company.
Do you hunt,
Mr. Forrester?
What?
Have you ever
been hunting?
No.
Do you own a hunting knife?
No.
What the fuck is going on?
Have you ever been
in possession
of a hunting knife?
No.
I'm giving you a chance
to cop a plea.
You think I killed my wife?
Prove it.
You're under arrest
for the murders
of Page Forrester
and Consuela Martinez.
Frank, read him his rights.
You have the right to remain silent.
If you give up that right,
anything you say
can be used against you
in a court of law.
Mr. Forrester is the editor
of The San Francisco Times
and the president
of Times-Lofton Publishing.
He is, however,
charged with two
capital-offense felonies.
Your Honor, the charges
are based purely on
circumstantial evidence.
Mr. Forrester
has no prior criminal record.
I don't expect him
to flee the jurisdiction.
Fine. Then set bail
of $500,000 will stand.
I've made calls back East.
We're gonna get a heavy hitter.
I don't want anybody
from out of town. I don't wanna
contribute to the circus.
Your firm has got to handle it.
We're corporate lawyers,
we can barely handle a hearing.
Jack, got something for us?
What do you think?
I'm innocent. That's all I can say.
What do you think about Krasny?
We have no comment.
Doesn't this have something to do
with the Senate race?
No further comment.
Look, my paper has
been critical
of Mr. Krasny's conduct
as district attorney,
that's no secret.
He's got big political
aspirations. You can draw
your own conclusions.
Excuse me.
Here he comes.
No comments at this time. Please.
This is going to be
a show trial.
We've only got one person
who's had criminal experience.
Who is he?
She.
And she hasn't practiced
criminal law for four years.
She any good?
Yes, she was a very good prosecutor.
She worked for Krasny.
Teddy, are you familiar
with the Jack Forrester case?
I go out of my way not to be familiar
with criminal cases.
Jack would like to speak to you
about representing him.
I'm in the middle of a case.
I think whatever the case is,
it can wait.
Oh, yes. Teddy--
There is nothing in the world that will
make me go back to criminal work.
You know the decision l made.
There's nothing in the world
I'd like less
than to lose Jack Forrester
as a client.
Teddy, you know the affection
that I've always had for you.
And nothing would please me more
than one day being able to
speak to you as one of my partners.
So, please, do an old man
a personal kindness.
Speak to him.
Who lives here anyway,
Joe Montana?
I told you, a guy
called Jack Forrester.
He killed his wife, l saw it on TV.
He allegedly killed his wife.
That means
he's gonna get away with it.
So how do I look?
Weird.
Weird.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Mr. Forrester is
expecting you.
No, I agree, but the murders
happened over two months ago.
There's no leads
because Krasny's locked into me.
Excuse me, I'll be right with you.
Look, l'll tell you what I'm gonna do
at the meeting.
All right, listen, l've gotta go.
I'll be home all evening, so if you
need me, you can catch me here.
All right. Bye.
Hello.
Hello.
Glad you came.
Nice to meet you.
Nice meeting you.
We met at a party
five or six years ago.
You probably don't remember.
Do you like horses?
Yeah, very much.
Come on.
- Andrew spoke to you?
- Yes, he did.
And?
The problem is
I don't do criminal work anymore.
Yes, l know. He told me.
I was hoping you'd reconsider.
I didn't kill my wife.
I didn't ask you if you did.
If you represented me,
you would.
I'd ask about the case they had
against you. I'd wanna win my case.
You win all your cases
when you were a prosecutor?
Yes, l won every one.
Is that why you wanted me
to represent you?
Yes, and because you're a woman
and because you're good.
You know what Krasny's capable of.
Thanks, Karen.
All right, let's show her
what you got. Come on.
I love this beauty.
He was Page's pride and joy.
Isn't he beautiful?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
The oldest equine species,
the most beautiful.
Perfectly tempered.
It makes men imperious
to sit on a horse.
Oliver Wendell Holmes, right?
Well, he was wrong.
Look at his legs.
Shows how vulnerable
we all are.
What's this lead Krasny
we're running Sunday?
It's a profile. Reviews his career,
looks at the Senate race.
The Senate race is nine months away.
I just thought now would be--
Look, folks.
I don't want any slant,
any bias on our coverage of my case
or of Krasny. Do you hear me?
I put my nuts into this paper
for 15 years.
I want routine objective coverage.
I'm gonna be taking
a leave of absence
till my trial's over.
Carl's gonna be
running things.
I'm gonna miss you.
Thank you.
You know how much l'm gonna miss
these machines?
Good evening, Mrs. Barnes.
Good evening.
Is Mr. Barnes here?
Yes. Right through there.
Hi.
Sorry l'm late.
We went to the zoo.
David's been after me
for weeks.
Damn, l was gonna
take him to the zoo
next weekend.
Oh, well.
We'll just do something else.
I'm starving.
Did I hear something about you
and the Forrester case?
You heard wrong.
Matthew,
remember Tom Krasny?
May I?
I think you should
take the case.
Think of the fun we'll have.
It wouldn't be any fun.
Maybe you're right.
Too bad about Styles.
What?
You remember Henry Styles.
He's dead.
What?
I'm sorry.
You didn't know.
He hanged himself.
When?
Day before yesterday.
I don't know how you figure it.
Teddy and I send this guy to the joint
four years ago,
he's halfway to his parole hearing,
he hangs himself.
You take care.
Good night.
When's Bridget gonna be back?
Bridget is coming...
She's coming back tomorrow.
What's for dinner?
What do you want?
I'll cook you anything.
Oh, God, Mom.
You can't cook.
Neither can Bridget.
Oh, yes, she can.
I thought you liked Bridget.
She farts too much.
Well, so do you.
At least it's not atom bombs.
Did you finish your homework?
- Yes.
Was Dad here last night?
- Mm-hm.
He was? Why didn't he wake us?
He kissed you
when you were asleep.
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye-bye, honey.
David?
David.
David?
Can I have my kiss?
Tell him to wake me next time.
I will.
Bye, Mom.
Bye-bye.
Have a good day.
Bye-bye.
Mrs. Styles.
You have no place here.
Wait a goddamn minute!
Teddy.
Christ.
You look like a real broad.
Come over here.
Oh, it's good to see you.
Come on in. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Teddy, l'm a busted tire,
for chrissake.
My lungs are shot.
I can't even piss straight.
You were the best investigator
the DA's office ever had.
A long time ago.
Four years.
I know the fuck how long ago it was.
Henry Styles.
Dumb fucking asshole.
He hanged himself.
I know.
I know you know.
You're here, aren't you?
Forrester isn't Styles, right?
Okay, let's say
the son of a bitch didn't do it.
You're never gonna get him off.
If he didn't do it, I'll get him off.
Why don't you stop the horseshit,
Teddy?
I don't give a flying fuck
how much money he's got.
Rich guy like Forrester,
where the hell is he gonna
find a jury of his peers?
He's gonna get
people who hate him
for what he's got.
If he didn't do it,
I'll get him off.
Forget Styles, will you?
Forget him.
You're gonna eat yourself alive
with that guilt you got.
I can't forget him,
and neither can you.
The fuck l can't!
I'm responsible and so are you.
Like hell I am!
Tom Krasny is responsible!
And fuck Styles, and fuck you
and your goddamned guilt.
I'll take the case
on one condition.
If you lie to me,
if l think you're guilty,
I'm gonna drop out.
That's not
a professional attitude.
I have no problem with that.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Okay. L want Sam to have access
to all personal and corporate
correspondence.
Financial records,
your wife's records, everything.
Absolute access.
You've got it.
We've got four months till the trial.
I don't want you out in public.
I don't wanna see you in the paper.
Look as though
your life has been shattered.
My life has been shattered.
Andrew, I don't want visible support
from the firm unless I ask for it.
I wanna sit alone, not with
a team of high-priced lawyers.
The jury will like that.
I like her.
Yeah? She pisses me off.
Nice to meet you.
Very happy.
See you tomorrow.
Andrew?
Be back in a moment.
So, what do you think?
What the fuck do l know?
Did your mother ever wash
your mouth out with soap?
Yeah, but it didn't do
any fucking good.
What if he passes
the polygraph test?
How you gonna know if he's lying?
I'll know.
Teddy, a guy like him,
you never know.
I'm representing Jack Forrester.
Is he finally
gonna cop a plea?
Go ahead.
I'm a reasonable man,
I'll listen.
I don't want any problems
with discovery.
I don't know
what you're talking about.
If you hold anything back on me,
I'm gonna bust your ass wide open.
You talk to your clients this way?
I mean it, Tom.
It is unprofessional
conduct for a prosecutor
to fail to disclose--
I know the words, Teddy.
I'm not gonna let it happen again.
You prosecuted Styles with me
and you did a good job.
The jury found him guilty.
He had a rap sheet
as long as my dick.
I'm gonna nail you to the wall.
I'll see you in court, counselor.
Consuela...
Consuela's door was open.
What could you see?
Blood.
I ran to our room.
Was the door closed?
No.
Open it.
I can't.
What did you see?
That word on the wall.
And the rope.
Her hands and her feet
were tied.
There was blood all around
her breasts and all over the bed.
She didn't have any clothes on.
Between her legs, the blood.
Oh, God.
How did you meet her?
We met at Stanford.
We met at this party,
I didn't even know her name.
Glad I didn't. I never would've
had the nerve to talk to her.
Then a couple of years later,
we ran into each other
at the country club.
I wasn't a member, but I used to
go in and use their pool
every once in a while.
Then we got married.
I started working for the paper.
I used to
bring coffee around to everybody.
I hated that shit.
Worked in Advertising-Circulation.
Got to know everything
about the company.
Her father liked me.
Why didn't you
ever have any children?
God, that's the biggest mistake
we ever made.
Were you faithful to her?
You know how many times
Krasny asked me that?
Yes, l was faithful to her.
Except for a short period,
a long time ago.
Wasn't even an affair, really.
It was a series of one-night stands.
The girl went back to France.
It didn't even
last a month.
You'll have to
tell me all about her.
Yeah, l'll send you all the details,
times, dates, restaurants.
You want the motel room numbers?
I may have forgotten those.
You're divorced,
aren't you?
Yeah.
Were you faithful to him?
Really?
Really.
Was she faithful to you?
Yeah, as far as l know.
What does that mean?
It means, as far as l know.
I didn't kill her.
I know you didn't.
No, you don't.
You just wanna get closer
to have a better look.
What you doing, Mom?
Oh, homework. Nothing much.
I could sure use a hug, though.
Oh, you're such
a good hugger.
Really?
Really.
Mom?
What?
Do you ever...?
Do you ever think about boys
and all that stuff?
Sometimes.
Do you ever
think about it with Dad?
Sometimes.
Mom?
I liked it when Dad was here
the other night.
I miss him, Mom.
Give me the bottom line, Dan.
The bottom line?
A straight, solid graph.
The machine loves him.
He's telling the truth.
Or he's a kind of ice cube
even the machine can't melt.
Is he psychopathic? No.
But he's manipulative.
He didn't get where he is
without being manipulative.
Neither did I, neither did you.
But did he do that bloodbath?
I don't know.
But if you're asking me whether
I think he's capable of doing that,
I saw nothing that would
lead me to that conclusion.
Sam, come on in.
Thank you, doctor.
I'll call you later.
All right, l've 832 got pages
signed, sealed and delivered
by Thomas Krasny, Esquire.
The People v. John C. Forrester.
It really took Krasny two months
to put this together?
Chrissake, he's got him tied
to that fucking knife.
No, he doesn't.
He has a janitor who claims
to have seen a knife in a locker.
Next best thing, isn't it?
Nope. It's not good enough.
It's circumstantial.
Krasny doesn't have the knife.
The janitor isn't identifying it.
What about this friend of his wife's,
this Virginia Howell?
It's hearsay
coming from one witness, Sam.
Kathy, would you get
Mr. Forrester on the phone
for me, please? Thank you.
Krasny's too smart.
Holding something back. That
son of a bitch has gotta have more.
Teddy, l gotta tell you,
I been watching this guy
for months now.
Do you wanna know what I think?
What l really think?
What do you think?
He killed her.
Hi.
He's got a witness
who saw a hunting knife
in your locker at the country club.
I figured something like that.
It's complete bullshit.
May I use your phone?
Yeah.
He described it.
He said it was 6 inches long--
I never had any kind of knife
in my locker.
Why would he be lying?
All I can tell you
is it never happened.
Did you always wanna be a lawyer?
I always wanted to be a prosecutor.
My dad was a cop.
What'd I get myself into?
You want some more of this?
No, thank you.
You're a very pretty lady.
She thinks, "Maybe he did do it.
It sounds like he's coming on to me."
You like to play games, don't you?
Racquetball. I play every day.
I used to play.
We should play. You're still in shape.
I don't play games with my clients.
Yeah, you do.
Tell me about Virginia Howell.
She's a real bitch.
She says your wife told her
she was gonna divorce you.
We can blow her
right out of the water.
You want some coffee?
Yeah. When you come back,
I wanna know exactly how.
When I come back,
I'll tell you exactly how.
Hello, Mr. Fabrizi? Teddy Barnes.
How do you know
it was this locker?
Because right after l saw it, I put it
together that it was Mr. Forrester's,
and it stuck in my head
that he had it.
Is there any possibility
that it wasn't this locker?
Lady, listen. I like Mr. Forrester.
I wished to Christ
I'd never seen the damn thing.
Now, you ask me if I think
Mr. Forrester killed his wife,
I'd say, "No way Mr. Forrester
would ever do a thing like that."
But, lady, you ask me if the knife
I saw was in the locker here,
I say, "Hell yes,
the son of a bitch was right up there."
I'm telling you now,
I see this trial degenerating
and l'll hit you like a freight train
roaring down the High Sierra.
We've got a man's life at stake here.
Not headlines, not careers.
Either of you have anything
you wanna share?
No, Your Honor.
Yes, Your Honor. I'm not satisfied
the prosecution is complying
with its discovery obligations.
I have complied,
Your Honor.
Do you have any evidence
Mr. Krasny has not complied
with his discovery obligations?
No, Your Honor.
Then what do you base
your allegation on?
On my past association
with Mr. Krasny, Your Honor.
Cite the case.
I held something back?
Cite the case, Teddy.
I hope I don't have to say this
to you again,
but you don't question ethics
in my chamber
unless you have the evidence
to support you.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Yes, Your Honor.
Why didn't you cite the case,
Teddy?
You could've gotten disbarred
before the trial.
Do you realize
how much I admired you?
Never got me anywhere with you,
did it?
What about Forrester?
You like him any better?
Yeah.
I like him a lot better.
Why don't you cite the case?
Put it all on the line.
The People v. Henry Styles.
Case number 26022.
You got me. Come on,
you can catch me. Watch out.
You can do it.
I'm not sure l want to.
Yes, you do. Come on.
See, it's a cinch.
Hey, where you going?
I'm getting you now.
Whoa.
Well, you ride very well.
Thank you.
That was wonderful.
I loved it.
You're not going anywhere.
You left your lights on.
I'll get a jumper.
Why don't you just take me home?
First time l saw you,
I wondered.
You did too, didn't you?
No.
You liar.
Dad?
David.
Sorry.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
You got another one of these
crank letters today.
Hello.
- Hi, Teddy.
Matthew.
Uh, David called from school.
He was a little upset.
Matthew, nothing happened.
Well, that's not what David said.
It's just so difficult. Lf I like someone,
I'd like to be able to invite him home.
I'll talk to David when they come
this weekend. Man to man.
Thanks.
Bye.
Hi.
Hi.
Got another one.
Yeah? Are all the T's slightly raised?
Yeah.
I had the last one analyzed.
Told me it was typed
on a 1942 Corona.
It's a big help, isn't it?
How you doing with the knife?
Striking out, that's how I'm doing.
How are you doing with our killer?
I like him.
You like him.
He wants you to like him.
The more you like him
the harder you'll work.
I know that, Sam.
I'm just reminding you, sweetheart.
I can't.
Yeah, you can.
No--
Let it go.
I can't.
Yes, you can.
I'm at a friend's house.
Jen, l gotta go, all right, darling?
Okay, l love you too. Bye-bye.
I make a great Denver omelet.
I have to go.
I know.
Look, l hope you don't think...
It's okay, Teddy.
Really, it is.
I want you to sit close to me
in court tomorrow.
I think you should help me
carry my things.
Might as well take advantage of the
fact that a woman is defending you.
The jury's gonna be watching
every move that we make,
so body language is really--
Wear a blue suit.
Juries like blue suits.
Anything else?
- Here they come.
- There they are.
Look, there they are, there.
They're across the street, come on.
All right, let's go. Come on.
- They're over here.
Jack, this way.
Any new developments in the case?
Hear ye, hear ye.
Superior Court for the county
of San Francisco is now in session.
The Honorable Clark Carrigan
presiding.
The facts in this case
are simple.
The people will prove
that on the night of
June 1 2th of this year,
the defendant, John C. Forrester,
brutally murdered his wife
and his wife's maid.
The murders were in cold blood
with malice aforethought.
And he did it out of lust and greed.
His greed for money
and his lust for power.
Finally, the people will prove
that John C. Forrester was,
in fact, living a lie.
That behind the facade
of all the dinners
and all the charity events
he and his wife attended,
their marriage was crumbling.
The people will prove
that if Page Forrester divorced him,
it would have meant
the end of his prestigious career.
The end, in fact, of his livelihood.
We will prove
that at the time of her death,
her brutal murder,
Page Forrester
was contemplating divorce.
Thank you
for your attention.
Ms. Barnes,
you wish to make your statement?
Yes, Your Honor.
John Forrester
did not murder his wife.
He did not murder his wife's maid.
He is an innocent man,
unjustly accused.
You may call your first witness.
My sister directly owned 20 percent
of the 8 million shares outstanding.
The shares were in her name.
She had absolute control.
Jack had less than 1 percent
of the shares in his name.
Mr. Lofton, could you tell us
the provisions of your sister's will?
Jack Forrester
is the direct beneficiary
of all my sister's assets.
All of it?
Corporate and personal assets?
Yes.
Mr. Lofton,
did your sister ever express
any dissatisfaction to you
about Jack's administration
of the company?
No, she was very pleased
with Jack's helmsmanship.
Did she ever express
any dissatisfaction to you
about her personal relationship
with her husband?
No.
- Never?
Never.
Mr. Lofton, do you think
Jack killed your sister?
God, no.
Objection.
I move to strike that from the record.
- Granted.
Jury, you will please ignore
the last remark.
The people call Mrs. Virginia Howell.
Mrs. Howell,
describe your relationship
with Page Forrester, please.
Well, we were like sisters.
What did she say
about her husband?
Objection, Your Honor.
It calls for hearsay.
This testimony is being offered
to show the state of mind of Page.
It's an exception to the hearsay rule.
Mr. Krasny has shown
no connection between
the state of mind of Mrs. Forrester,
my client and the charges in this case.
I'll allow it, subject to connection
to Mr. Forrester.
Mrs. Howell, what did Page
say about her relationship
with her husband?
She knew that he didn't love her
and she was sure that
he was seeing someone else.
And did she tell you anything else?
She was going to tell her husband
that she wanted a divorce.
Thank you.
I will tolerate no further disruptions
in this courtroom.
Mrs. Howell,
when was the last time
you saw Mrs. Forrester at her home?
At her home?
I really don't remember.
Wasn't it about the same time
she stopped playing tennis with you
at the club?
No, we played together all the time.
She's bluffing.
Isn't it true, Mrs. Howell,
that six months before her death,
Page Forrester broke all contact
with you?
No, we spoke together
on the telephone
and we'd see each other
at the club.
Mrs. Howell,
you find Jack Forrester
an attractive man, don't you?
What do you mean?
Isn't it true that Page Forrester
broke all contact with you
because she learned you were trying
to seduce her husband?
That's not true.
You're under oath.
Objection.
Badgering the witness,
Your Honor.
Motion denied.
Isn't it true, Mrs. Howell, that during
the week of December 7th, 1984,
you called Jack Forrester at his
office on eight separate occasions?
I don't remember that.
Let me refresh your memory.
December 7th,
9:40 a.m. and 4:23 p.m.
December 8th,
10:15 a.m. and 3:45 p.m.
Would you like me
to read the list to you?
Jesus Christ,
how did you miss this?
Tom, she came to us.
How was l supposed to know?
Did you ever write to Mr. Forrester?
No.
No?
No.
Is this note in your handwriting,
Mrs. Howell?
Yes.
Your Honor,
I ask that this be marked as Defense
Exhibit A and admitted into evidence.
Mrs. Howell, did you send this note
to Jack Forrester?
Yes, l suppose so.
Will you read it, please?
"Dear Jack,
I've been trying to reach you
all week.
I'll be at the Canyon
in Palm Springs.
Wouldn't it be fun
if you came down?
Isn't it silly to keep avoiding me?
Page will never know."
How is it signed, Mrs. Howell?
"Love, Ginny."
Your Honor,
may I show this to the jury?
Mrs. Howell,
did Mr. Forrester meet you
in Palm Springs?
No.
Did he meet you anytime, anywhere?
No.
What did he do with your note?
I really don't know.
He gave it to his wife, didn't he?
I don't know.
Why don't you ask her?
Mrs. Howell, did Mrs. Forrester,
to your knowledge,
begin divorce proceedings
against her husband?
No.
No further questions, Your Honor.
How was l supposed
to find out, Tom?
Only the two of them knew.
Mom, l don't understand this.
Honey, why don't you go ask Jenny?
I don't wanna ask Jenny.
David, l have a trial tomorrow.
I've got a test tomorrow.
Honestly, David.
You don't care.
Forget it.
I hope he did it. I hope he's guilty.
Oh, David, honey. Come here.
David-- David, honey, come on.
I didn't--
Hi, Sam.
Teddy, come here.
A tennis pro at the club,
a guy named Slade,
"Bobby Slade," talked to
the bartender at the club.
Two weeks ago
he drops out of sight
when guys from the DA's office
come to see him.
Krasny's gonna spring him on us.
What do you have on him?
Just that
he worked in all the clubs.
I got La Jolla, Laguna,
Newport Beach, Santa Cruz.
Santa Cruz?
Yeah.
And l talked to 183 goddamn
club members about that knife.
You know what I get?
Nada, zilch.
I told you, you're dreaming.
What about former club members?
People who quit after January
of last year.
Come on,
that's a wild-goose chase.
Sam, he didn't do it.
Yeah?
Is that your head
talking or another part
of your anatomy?
Hey, okay, what the hell?
Fuck me.
You may call your next witness.
The people call Eileen Avery,
Your Honor.
Who's she?
Your Honor,
may counsel approach the bench?
This witness was not mentioned
in the discovery material.
I told you the prosecution
was not complying--
She's a reluctant witness.
She was served a subpoena
on the basis of information
we uncovered yesterday.
Bullshit.
Ms. Barnes.
I want it on the record.
I'll put it on the record.
You think that's gonna hold up
in appeal?
What appeal? You expect to lose?
Here's the subpoena, Your Honor.
I'll allow her testimony.
Put the circumstances
of the subpoena on the record.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Let's continue.
Let the record show that Miss Eileen
Avery is a reluctant witness.
Get something for me
as fast as possible.
Who is she?
A friend.
What do you mean, a friend?
A friend, that's all.
- State your name, please.
- Eileen Avery.
How old are you?
I'm 26.
What's your relationship
to John C. Forrester?
He's a friend of mine.
Between July and December of 1983
what was your relationship to him?
He was my...
He was my lover.
You had an affair with him
for six months
two years ago?
Answer the question, please.
Yes, l did.
You were in love with him?
Yes, l was.
And he was in love with you?
Yes.
Did Mr. Forrester ever speak to you
about divorcing his wife?
Please, Miss Avery.
He said he wanted to.
Yes?
He said he could never do it.
And why could he never do it?
Because he said
he would lose everything
he had always worked for.
Your witness, Mrs. Barnes.
No questions.
Thank you, Miss Avery.
You may step down.
The people call Robert Slade.
Mr. Slade,
how did you meet Mrs. Forrester?
I played tennis with her at the club.
And you became friends.
She liked me, l liked her a lot too.
It went on from there.
You had an intimate, sexual
relationship with Mrs. Forrester?
Yes.
For how long?
Let's see.
I got to the club in November of '83
until the time she died.
You knew Mrs. Forrester
was married?
Sure.
Didn't seem to bother her though.
What do you mean?
She said he didn't care what she did.
Objection as to form.
Sustained.
Did she ever talk to you
about her husband?
Objection. Hearsay.
I'm trying to establish the state
of mind of Mrs. Forrester
prior to her murder.
The testimony is irrelevant.
I think I can establish
the relevancy of the testimony.
You may proceed.
Did she ever speak to you about
her relationship with her husband?
She said he didn't care what she did.
Move to strike, Your Honor.
Motion denied.
Please continue.
She said she knew
he was seeing someone too.
Whoever he was seeing,
Page said he'd take her riding
all the time.
Riding?
Yeah,
she joked about it. She said
those horses of his were, uh,
foreplay.
Mr. Slade,
did Mrs. Forrester ever talk
about divorcing her husband?
She was thinking about it.
She said the only thing that stopped
her from getting a divorce before
is that he was doing such a good job
running the company.
She said he had
a million-dollar image.
I remember once, she said
that she knew he was using her,
but she said
she was using him too.
She said that was his special talent.
He really knew how to use people.
Your witness.
Due to the lateness of the hour,
we will adjourn and reconvene
at 9:00 Monday morning.
Well, that's it. Lt's over.
You didn't think he'd find out?
Four years ago,
I walked away from all this.
I felt that I was drowning,
over my head.
The dirt, the slime.
You played me.
You played me so well.
No.
You set me up
from the very beginning.
How did you find out
about Styles?
That's why you wanted me
to defend you.
What are you talking about?
If you'd told me about Avery,
I wouldn't have taken the case.
I had an affair with somebody.
That doesn't mean I killed my wife.
Teddy, l couldn't tell you.
I couldn't tell you in the beginning--
That's why, because you wouldn't
have taken the case.
Later on, l...
What?
I couldn't, because then you wouldn't
have thought we were real.
You lied to me.
I had to lie to you.
Don't you understand?
I had to lie to you.
Teddy, that stuff about Page,
I didn't know anything about it.
I didn't wanna be used anymore.
I gave all this up because l just...
I wanted to clean myself off.
I'm dropping the case.
You can't.
It's my life. Lt's my life. You can't.
I didn't kill her.
I don't believe you.
What did he say?
I told you.
I don't wanna hear it.
We got another letter
from the 1942 Corona.
I'm sorry to disturb you,
Your Honor.
It's against all better judgment
for me to speak with you.
Please, Your Honor.
Did this hypothetical client
confess his guilt
to his hypothetical lawyer?
Then the defense counsel
has no real ethical dilemma.
He took an oath.
He must live up to that oath.
What if he finds that he can't?
Then he had no business
taking the oath in the first place.
What if someone came to you
under circumstances like these
and asked to be dropped
from a case?
I probably would accede to his
or her wishes,
but with great regret.
Teddy.
Teddy?
What the fuck are you doing
sitting in the dark?
You playing with yourself?
Are you okay?
You're gonna love
what we got on Bobby Slade.
What the hell's the matter
with you? Come on, read it.
Hey,
are you okay?
No.
You're not okay,
you look like shit.
Oh, baby.
I'm sorry. Come here.
Oh, goddamn it.
I'm sorry, kid.
Hear ye, hear ye.
Superior Court for the county
of San Francisco is now in session.
The Honorable Clark Carrigan
presiding.
Will counsel please approach
the bench?
Do you have anything you wanna say
to me, Ms. Barnes?
Yes, Your Honor.
The defense would like
to recall Bobby Slade.
Recall Robert Slade.
Mr. Slade, where were
you employed before
the Hillsborough Country Club?
At the Oceanside Racquet Club
in Santa Cruz.
What were the circumstances
under which you left there?
I don't understand.
I think you do.
You were fired, were you not,
Mr. Slade?
No, I got a better offer
from Hillsborough.
Isn't it true that you were fired in
Santa Cruz for selling sexual favors?
That's not true.
Perjury is a criminal offense.
Objection, Your Honor.
I presume you know the penalty
for committing perjury, Mr. Slade?
That's what they said,
but there's no proof. There's nothing
on my record. I wasn't fired, I left.
During the course of your sexual
relationship with Mrs. Forrester,
where did you have sex with her?
Motels, the house in Hillsborough,
down at the beach house.
The house in Baker Beach?
Yes.
Where the murders took place.
Did Mrs. Forrester ever pay you
for having sex with her?
She was beautiful.
She didn't have to pay anybody.
What kind of sex did you have?
What do you mean?
Did you tie her up?
Objection, Your Honor.
Sustained.
You fucking bitch.
What did you call me?
Your Honor, l object.
- Denied.
What did you call me, Mr. Slade?
You called me a bitch.
Is that what you called me,
Mr. Slade?
Speak up, Mr. Slade.
Yes.
No further questions, Your Honor.
No questions.
The people call
Anthony Fabrizi.
It was a 6-inch hunting knife
with jags on the edge.
And what locker
was it in?
It was in locker number 122.
And whose locker
is that?
It was, uh,
Mr. Forrester's locker.
Mr. Fabrizi, are you
absolutely certain that
the knife that you saw
on January 2nd, 1984,
was in Mr. Forrester's
locker?
Yes, l am certain.
Your witness.
No questions.
The people rest.
That will be all, Mr. Fabrizi.
Are you ready
to call your first witness,
Ms. Barnes?
I am, Your Honor.
We call Duane Bendix.
Who's Duane Bendix?
Find out who Duane Bendix is.
Mr. Bendix, were you a member
of the Hillsborough Country Club
on January 2nd 1984?
Yes, l was.
Mr. Bendix,
was there a knife on that date in
your locker at the country club?
- There was.
- What kind of knife was it?
It was a hunting knife with
a 6-inch blade and a jagged edge.
Is this the knife?
Yes, it is.
And Mr. Bendix, what was
your locker number at the club?
222.
No further questions.
Your witness, Mr. Krasny.
No questions.
Thank you, Mr. Bendix.
Your Honor, we would like to recall
Anthony Fabrizi.
Mr. Fabrizi, I'd like to remind you
that you are still under oath.
Thank you, judge.
Mr. Fabrizi,
are you certain,
beyond any doubt,
the knife you saw
was in Locker 122
and not in Locker 222?
No, it was in Locker 122.
I remember because
I put it together in my head
as l walked away,
that it was Mr. Forrester's.
Where was Mr. Bendix's locker
in relation to Mr. Forrester's?
Well, it was in the row
right behind his.
Mr. Fabrizi, does this
look like the knife
that you saw that day?
No, this one's different.
How is it different?
Well, it's the same
kind of knife, all right,
but this one here's all scratched up
on the sides, and the handle's worn.
If this knife was brand-new
and hadn't been used for over a year,
would it look like
the knife you saw?
Could it have been the knife
you saw?
Is it possible, Mr. Fabrizi?
Jesus Christ, I don't know.
Yeah, sure, it's possible.
Your Honor,
I would like this knife marked
and admitted into evidence
as Defense Exhibit B.
Your witness.
Mr. Fabrizi--?
What the hell are you gonna
ask me now?
I told her, it looks different.
I don't know.
If it was brand-new, sure.
It's possible it was the one I seen.
I don't know how I could've mistaken
the locker numbers.
No questions.
Thank you, Mr. Fabrizi. That's all.
We will adjourn
and reconvene again
tomorrow morning 9:00.
Can I talk to you?
There's nothing to talk about.
I tried calling you all weekend.
I went over to your place.
You still think I'm guilty?
How can you defend me
if you think l'm guilty?
It happens all the time.
It's the way our legal system works.
I bet you're a cold fuck.
What do you want, Mr. Slade?
You really think you're something,
don't you?
You twist everything around,
don't you?
You just don't give a shit.
I bet l could warm you up.
I bet l could make you
real hot.
Jen, hi.
What are you doing?
No, no, I'm at the office.
I just wanted to call.
Get David to watch spider-Man
while you do your homework.
Okay.
Why don't we talk about that
when l get home, okay?
All right. L love you.
Bye-bye.
Julie Jensen?
I'd like to talk to you. My name is--
I know who you are.
Hear ye, hear ye.
Superior Court for the county
of San Francisco is now in session.
The Honorable Clark Carrigan
presiding.
Ms. Barnes, call your next witness.
Your Honor,
we call Julie Jensen.
Ms. Jensen,
where do you reside?
At 1326 Del Mar Lane
in Santa Cruz.
Would you describe for us
the events which took place
on the night of January 21st, 1984?
Objection, Your Honor.
This testimony is not relevant.
This testimony is directly related
to the crimes Forrester is accused of,
and Mr. Krasny knows it.
The witness may continue.
I was in my bedroom,
I woke up,
there was a knife at my throat.
There was a man there.
He was dressed in black, all black.
Pants, a turtleneck.
He wore a black ski mask.
I never saw his face.
Objection, Your Honor.
This crime is not
relevant to this case.
Overruled.
He kept the knife pressed
to my throat.
It was a big knife.
It had these jags on the top.
He tied my hands and my legs
to the bed.
He cut my nightgown off of me.
What did he do then?
He pushed the knife
against my nipples
and he cut me.
How did he cut you?
He cut around my right nipple
with the tip of the knife
and then he, uh, smeared the knife
with the blood.
And he got up
and he wrote it on the wall.
What did he write?
He wrote the word "bitch."
Then he came back to the bed,
and he started putting the knife
between my legs.
But he didn't
cut me.
And then he suddenly
stopped.
And he
went away.
And these events took place
at your beach house in Santa Cruz
on January 21st, 1984,
18 months before the murders
at Baker Beach?
Yes.
Well done.
Ms. Jensen,
did you ever
relate these events
to anyone from
the district attorney's office?
Your Honor, that is irrelevant.
Overruled.
Yes, l did.
To that man there.
To this man? Mr. Arnold?
An assistant district attorney.
Yes.
When did you relate these events
to him?
He came to see me three weeks
after Mrs. Forrester was killed.
And he came back to see me
two days later.
When Mr. Arnold came back
to see you, what did he tell you?
He told me the Baker Beach killings
were not related
to what happened to me.
Ms. Jensen,
were you a member of the Oceanside
Racquet Club in Santa Cruz
from January to October 1983?
Yes.
- Do you play tennis?
I did before this happened.
Did you ever play with the club's pro,
Bobby Slade?
I object--
Yes!
Bobby Slade is not on trial here!
Why isn't he?
You knew, you hushed it up.
You're trying to mislead this jury.
That is not true and you know it.
I will see you both in chambers.
All I'm asking for
is a two-week continuance.
For what, to tie him into
the Santa Cruz crime?
He's had months to, he can't
He's innocent and you know it.
That's why he didn't
turn over her statement.
How the hell did you find her?
She kept her name out of the papers.
We saw the police report.
We pulled it.
You pulled the police report?
You've breached the canon of ethics,
Mr. Krasny.
Now, your request is denied.
If it were up to me,
I'd vote to disbar you.
He told you, didn't he?
He told you.
What did he do?
Did he phone you?
Send you anonymous notes?
You'll stop at nothing,
won't you?
Anyone could've sent those.
Everyone knew.
The police in Santa Cruz,
people in your office.
Bullshit.
Don't you understand what he did?
He did the identical crime 18 months
before he murdered his wife.
He knew
it would get him off the hook.
He knew Bobby Slade
was seeing his wife.
That's why he did the first crime
in Santa Cruz.
He threw us Bobby Slade
as a suspect.
He picked that woman
very carefully.
He knew she played tennis
with Slade.
He planned this for 18 months.
He is not a psychopath.
He is an ice man.
He is a monster.
You're the monster, Tom.
If you make any attempt
to implicate Mr. Forrester
in the Santa Cruz crime,
I shall strike it.
He is not charged with that offense.
They're in.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?
We have, Your Honor.
"Not guilty."
We stand in recess.
Mr. Forrester,
can we have a statement, please?
How do you feel about this?
- I'm so proud of you.
I'm proud of you.
Stay back. Stay back.
I'd like to say something, please.
I'd like to say something, please.
Four years ago, I resigned my job
as an assistant district attorney.
I'd like to tell you why.
I prosecuted a case with Mr. Krasny.
It was a very newsworthy case.
The kind of case that wins elections,
makes careers.
We convicted the man
and he went to jail.
A week after the trial, I discovered
that during the trial,
one of our investigators
had come up with evidence
which would have exonerated
the man we were prosecuting,
and that Mr. Krasny had buried
that evidence.
Can you verify that?
Although I found--
I didn't do anything.
I didn't tell anyone.
I let that man...
He hanged himself in prison.
I will have to learn to live with that,
somehow.
The People v. Henry Styles.
Case number 26022.
Mr. Krasny,
do you have a comment on that?
Can you comment on that?
Do you have any comment on that?
Mr. Krasny.
- Mr. Krasny.
Can I have a comment from you?
Do you have any comment?
Just one statement,
- People, stay back.
- We can't get to it all.
Please, people, stay back.
Your partners are
very proud of you.
--Today's verdict
has been a vindication of
the way our legal system works.
It couldn't have happened
without Teddy Barnes.
Yoo-hoo! Where are you?
Congratulations.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Congratulations.
Congratulations.
What's going on?
We're going to my house,
give you a chance to celebrate.
But I don't have anybody
to celebrate with.
Oh, yes, you do.
Come on, you guys.
Bye, Mom.
Bye, Mom.
L feel vindicated.
More than anything,
today's verdict has been
a vindication of our legal system.
It couldn't have happened
without Teddy Barnes.
I'Il never be able to thank her.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Mr. Forrester.
This is Jack Forrester.
He was just found not guilty
of the brutal murders of his wife
and her maid.
That's the situation here.
This word just in to the Channel 7
- Police are now seeking
Hillsborough Country Club
tennis pro Bobby Slade
for questioning in the killings.
We'll have full details
and a fiIm report at 11 :00.
Well, l don't know, you can have it.
And as far as the grass goes,
it's great. I love it. L love it. It's terrific.
You might take
a couple of branches off...
Good morning.
Good afternoon.
What time is it?
The time is 3:30.
Are you hungry?
I'm starving.
Good. I made some brunch for us.
I'm gonna go to the stables.
I'll be back 10, 15 minutes.
You know how l feel?
I feel free.
Free!
Where you going?
It's David. He has a fever.
I've gotta go home.
Oh, no.
Go on, Ed.
What's the matter with him?
I don't know. Matthew called.
Well, l'll come with you.
No. I'll call.
Here, let me try.
Can I at least kiss you goodbye?
HelIo? Teddy?
Yes?
How's David?
He's fine.
Well, what was the matter with him?
I've...
Nothing.
Come on, you said he had a fever.
I found the typewriter.
What typewriter?
What are you talking about?
You killed her.
What is the matter with you?
Teddy, l love you--
No.
Will you listen to me?
No.
I'm on my way over to you right now.
No. No. No!
Yeah, hello?
Sam?
Yeah?
Sam...
What the hell's the matter?
I-- l-- I need to talk--
Need to talk to you, Sam.
Well, what?
Teddy?
What is it?
Teddy, for chrissake, what is it?
Nothing.
I just wanted to...
I just wanted to say thank you.
Thank me?
What the fuck you gotta
thank me for, baby?
They got a warrant out on Bobby
Slade. They're gonna charge him.
Hey, did you hear me?
I don't want to hear
about Bobby Slade.
Are you sure you're all right?
Sure you don't want me
to come over?
No.
No, nothing's wrong.
It's all right now.
Bye, Sam.
I need to see your face, Jack.
I could've loved--
Jesus Christ.
Fuck him. He was trash.
