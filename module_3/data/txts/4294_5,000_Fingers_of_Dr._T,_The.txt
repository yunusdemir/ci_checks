Morning, gentlemen.Uh-huh.
Uh, this is, uh, Nick.
It's his first day.
Well, it's nice
to see a fresh face.
No offense, Carl.
Well, I got to say,
you're lucky to have
this guy as a partner.
Carl has seen it all.
Haven't you?
Carl?
Everything okay?
I'm sorry.
Don't do it!
Open it up!
This is a robbery!
Everybody stay calm
and nobody gets hurt.
Come on. Quickly.
Nobody needs to die today.
Hey, y'all think
this a game, huh?
Open it up!
Open it up!
Open the door...
or I'm going to kill you.
Head down!
Start moving your way
to the center of the bank.
Get off the door!
Get to the center.
Look at the floor.
No heroes, no problems. Got it?
We have a 0-3-0.
Armed robbery in progress
at Bank of Oahu.
1147 Kuhio Avenue.
Call's out. Three minutes.
Three minutes. Three minutes.
There you go.
Thank you.
Whoa!
Do we have a problem? Damn it, Nick.
Nose to the floor.
Head down! Unless you want
me to blow it off.
Yo, what the hell was that?
What? He was giving me trouble.
Face down, nose to the floor.
We're almost out of here.
Real good, real good.
Come on.
Let's go, kids.
Grab those doors.
Let's go.
Let's run.
Nobody move!
Nobody move!
Let's go.

Yo.
Hey, we know if this
is the same crew
that hit the Union
Liberty Bank last week?
Not unless they changed
their MO.
That crew took 30 grand
from the teller's drawer.
These guys came in
and cleaned out the vaults
to the tune
of $2.6 million.Whoa.
$2.6 million?
Banks don't carry
that kind of cash,
they got a couple
hundred grand, tops.
Yeah, well, this
just so happened to be
the day where the bank was
completely flushed with cash.
Yeah, these guys clearly
had inside information.
Oh, that ain't the half of it.
Wait till you see how
they pulled this thing off.
Come with me.
And after I heard the gunshots,
I didn't want
to take any chances.
Oh, Miss Lee, this is my partner...
Junior.
Hey, Jenny. Hey. Hey. Hi.
You okay? Yeah, just...
shaken up, you know?
Okay. Take a seat.
Jenny, she's an
old friend of mine.
She was next door neighbors
with my cousin.
And I saw her all
the time growing up.
Wow, well, I'm sorry we
have to meet like this.
Jenny, is there anything else
that you could tell us
about the people who did this?
Sorry, but it all
happened so fast, and...
my head was down the whole time.
I wish I could be more helpful.
McGARRETT: Okay, so,
the partner's
the inside man, right?
Teams up with this crew,
pulls off the job?
Close but not quite.
This is the person Carl Norris
walked into the bank with.
But I reached out
to the armored truck company
and according to them,
the second guard assigned
to today's run was this guy.
McGARRETT: Nohea Kepule.
Norris's usual partner.
They were seen leaving
the armored truck facility
this morning at 7:30 together.
This heist crew,
they jack the truck, right?
Somewhere along the route.
And they switch out
their guy for Kepule.
Except it looks like
they had their own truck.
According to HPD,
the vehicle the crew
were driving was packing
enough horsepower
to blow through
a police roadblock
and evade pursuit.
They had also fitted run-flat
tires and bullet-proof glass.
I'm thinking they modified
an identical vehicle
to match the company's
armored truck.
These armored truck companies
outfit all of their trucks
with GPS.
I have visual on the van.
Moving.
Guys, there's someone
in the truck.
He's alive.
For real. Level with me.
Mm-hmm. And does it sound like...
it's overover, or it sound
like I can get her back?
Well, it depends.
Did she get a new haircut yet?
Uh, yeah, actually. Last week.
Hell...
Sorry, it-it's definitely over.
Why do you say that?
What does that have to do
with anything? Because, dude,
when a woman gets a haircut
after a breakup...
that's it; She's done.
She's hit
the reset button, okay?
Best you can do
is forget about her
and move on.
Just take it from a guy
who's been married 20 years.
All right?
Never take them at face value.
There's always something
more complicated going on.
Hi, honey.
Oh, your ears must be burning.
Okay.
I understand.
Everything okay, brah?
Uh, uh, take this left up here.
What you mean, take this left?
You know route, man, I...
Just do it!
Are you crazy? I'm so sorry.
And that's the last thing
I remember.
When I came to,
my head was pounding.
Carl was gone.
That's it.
Thank you. Thank you.
All right, thank you, guys.
Wait, wait, wait.
Is he okay?
What happened?
I'm sorry, uh,
Carl didn't make it.
McGARRETT: We're really sorry.
Thanks for your help.
We'll be in touch, okay?
Okay, so right before
this guy goes postal,
pulls a gun on his
partner, he gets
a phone call from his wife. They
were using her to leverage Carl
into doing this.
We got a home address? ADAM: Yeah.
In Kaimuki.
♪
This doesn't look great.
He's one of our heist crew.
Stab wound to the carotid.
Must've bled out in minutes.
That's great.
Who did it?
The wife's injuries are minor.
She's still in shock,
so they're taking her
to the hospital.
It's probably gonna be a minute
before we get a statement
out of her.
Okay, well, in the meantime,
we got an ID
on the dead guy you found.
Name's Milo Harris,
and, unsurprisingly,
he's got a long list of priors.
In fact, he just got out
of Halawa three weeks ago.
All right, look, let's dig
into his known associates,
hopefully that'll help lead us
to the other members
of this heist crew,
and in the meantime,
dump his phone.
Okay? All right, I'll
keep you posted.
Well, I have to cancel
my 5:00 p.m. mermaid class.
This case isn't getting
closed anytime soon.
What're you doing?
I'm just scrubbing through
footage from the robbery.
Isn't that your friend, Jenny?
Yup, and check this out.
She was so adamant
about the fact
she hadn't seen anything.
She said her head was
down the entire time.
Exactly. So why would
she be lying?
Okay, so,
maybe I did lift my head
at one point,
but you have to understand,
it all happened so quickly
and I was terrified.
I guess I just didn't remember.
We-we do understand.
We do. You were scared.
Adrenaline was pumping,
the details are probably fuzzy.
Or...
maybe it was because
you were scared
of what these people
might do to you if they
found out that you were
talking to the cops.
Jenny, if you're worried
about your safety,
our job is to protect you.
Okay? But you just have to tell
us exactly what happened.
Hey, it's okay.
It's okay.
I don't know if it was
the sound of his voice,
but I instantly recognized him.
And I knew that
if I was right...
then he probably
recognized me, which meant
he could come after me.
Come after my family.
No. Hey, Jenny, look.
I won't let that happen.
I promise you.
It was Tory.
Tory Laeha.
You sure?
Yes.
His eyes,
his voice, his build.
I'm 99% sure it was him.
Tory Laeha is Layla's boyfriend.
Your ex Layla?
Yeah.
Pick up that phone
and call your husband, now.
Give me the phone.
Hi, honey.
Oh, your ears must be burning.
Listen very carefully
and don't say a word.
We have your wife.
Did he say anything else
during that time?
Anything else that
might help us?
I-I remember...
he said on the phone,
before he hung up...
Uh-huh?
"I'll see you at the harbor."
Okay.
The harbor,
that's... that's good.
Did he say which one?
I'm sorry!
No, no, no, you did great.
You've helped us out
a great deal, Caitlyn.
Thank you so much.
You asked me for advice,
and I gave it to you.
You got to bring this
to McGarrett, like, now.
I can't! Okay?
Not until I'm 100% sure
that it was Tory.
I owe Layla that much.
Do you? Yeah.
Yeah.
I think you should maybe
rethink your priorities, Joon.
No?
If McGarrett finds out that
you're sitting on information
that slowed down
an investigation,
you could be out of a job.
You don't think I know that?
See, it wasn't that long ago
that I was there for you
when you got mixed up
with the gun in Adam's house.
That was entirely different
'cause Adam was one of us.
Tani, I get that Layla
means nothing to you,
but she means a lot to me.
Okay.
All right, I got your back.
Whatever you need to do,
just do it, and do it fast.
All right. Just give me one
hour, okay? Just let me talk
to Layla and see
what I can find out.
Okay.
Thank you.
Wait. Wh... D...
Do you want me to come?
No, it's okay. I got this.
Just a minute.
Junior, wow.
I know it's been a while, but
you did say we should catch up.
Yeah, that was, uh,
that was quite a while ago.Yeah.
I remember because this guy
was about to pop.
You want to introduce me?
Yeah, yeah, uh, Junior,
this is Kai.
Hey, Kai. Hey, buddy.
Um...
You like trucks?
Tory and I did the math,
and after paying for daycare
I'd maybe be breaking even
with what I was making
from teaching, so I figured,
why pay someone else
to watch my kid?
Yeah. Well, it makes sense.
I always knew you'd make
a great mom someday.
Thanks.
Uh, sorry, I need to put
Kai down for his nap. Yeah, of course.
Oh...
Come on, little man.
Time for some shut-eye.
Let's go. Uh, just
give me one sec. Okay, I'll...
♪
Sorry about that. No, no, you're okay.
So, uh, how is Tory, by the way?
What's he been up to these days?
Oh, he's good. He's got a job at
a body shop. He's been working
really hard, taking a lot
of overtime and stuff.
It's not easy supporting
a family on a single income,
but... we manage.
Yeah. He still hanging around
with the same crew
from back in the day?
Why would you ask that?
I don't know. Y-You know,
you two have a kid together.
I just like to think he's
keeping himself out of trouble.
Okay, Junior, what is this?
Why are you really here?
All right, okay,
Layla, listen to me.
All right, I need
you to hear what
I'm about to tell you, okay?
There was a bank robbery
this morning
and I have reason to believe
that Tory was involved.
God, you're unbelievable.
No, no, no. All I...
Don't touch me.O-Okay. All I need to know
is where he was from 7:00 a.m.
to 9:00 this morning.
If you wanted to interrogate me
about my boyfriend,
you should've said so,
instead of coming here
and pretending you give a damn
about me and my kid.
No, no, no, Layla, I care about
you, okay? That's why I'm here.
Because I don't want HPD
busting through those doors,
tearing this place apart,
while your baby is in the room.
Oh, this is, this is you
doing me a favor?
Layla, he used to run with a
bad crew, okay? He has a record.
People change, Junior.
You, more than anyone,
should know that.
Do you want to know
where he was this morning?
He was at work,
providing for his family.
Let yourself out.
I was able to use cell tower
data to triangulate
the last position
of the callers.
Now within an hour
of the bank heist,
one burner pinged
a tower within a mile
from the bank.
This clearly belonged to one
of the crew members
that hit the bank.
And Milo's pinged
where we'd expect it,
within the vicinity of the house
where he was holding
Carl's wife hostage.
And then this third number
pinged a tower downtown.
There's your criminal
mastermind.
That's the guy who planned it.
Stands to reason he would be
not involved and at
some other location
just sitting by the phone
waiting for a call
telling him how the job went.
That's what I was thinking,
'cause at 8:41,
seven minutes after
the crew fled the bank,
they called the number downtown.
The number downtown
then called Milo.
And immediately thereafter,
all three were turned off.
We checked in with the
HDOT's Harbor Division.
There's an alert out,
but so far no
suspicious activity.
Uh, if they're using
the harbors, they're gone.
I mean, I agree with you,
but we got to work
with the leads we got, right?
So this last spot where
the phones were last used
and turned off, I'm thinking
there's a good chance
that's where they were dumped,
maybe even the truck, too.
So why don't we get down to HPD,
have them send all
available units down there,
search the area.
In the meantime,
let's follow
the harbor lead, all right?
Okay.
Oh, hey, Tani Rey.
Where's Junior?
Um, yeah, I think he's just
following up with a lead from
one of the witness interviews.
He should be back soon.
Brief him when
you see him, please.
Yeah, I will. Thank you.
You've
reached Officer Junior Reigns...
Mind if I join?
Junior. Howzit?
I know you robbed
the bank this morning.
Wow.
Here I thought this was gonna be
a nice catch-up conversation.
Let me take you in,
and if you cooperate
I can help you.
If you don't,
this won't end well.
It was good seeing you, Junior.
Authorities have yet to release
the names of the two victims,
but they are believed to be
a bank employee
and a driver
for the armored truck company
that services the bank.
No word on whether this robbery
is connected
to the one last week
at Union Liberty Bank...
in Honolulu.
Wait till Bob hears
about this, Nick.
You shouldn't have killed him.
Bob's not gonna do anything.
You were real cute, Nicky.
Will you quit bitching?
Okay, I did what I had to do.
It was a clean score
until you went psycho
and started killing people.
We got the money,
didn't we?! And a load of unnecessary heat!
Hey, hey!
Both of you, knock it off.
I agreed to rob a bank,
not do time as an
accessory to murder.
Who said we're doing time?
You need to chill.
Did you take care
of the truck? Yeah, torched it,
along with the uniforms
and phones.
Well, then, it's not
all bad, is it?
Hmm?
Hold on.
Where's Milo?
Milo isn't here.
Everything changed
when you went off book.
We didn't plan on
leaving witnesses,
so I had to send Milo
to take care of the wife.
Got it.
But how long's it take
to put a bullet in her head?
He's got a point.
What if the reason that
Milo isn't here
is because the cops got him?
Lookit, you let me
worry about Milo.
Take these new burners...
go back to work.
Or go wherever
you degenerates go
when you waste your time.
The point is,
stay out of trouble.
Lay low, all right?
Until I call you
on these new burners
and set up a meet, where we can
divvy up everything.
You got it?
Yeah.
You sure we can trust you
to do the accounting
on this one?
What did you just say?
I'm just joking, Bob.
I trust you.
I trust you.
Besides...
I know where you live. Mm.
Let's go, boys.
Guess it isn't good news, then.
Milo's dead.
A guy I know in the department
confirmed it.
But it's not all bad news.
We're better off with him dead
than in custody.
And everybody's take
just went up.
Stash this away somewhere safe.
Don't be flashing
the cash around.
The cops are watching.
And understand,
if one of us goes down,
we all go down.
Huh?
And listen.
The hard part's behind us,
so don't do anything stupid,
and we'll get away
from this free.
Yeah, about that.
I think we have a problem.
I'm sorry, I should have
brought this to you sooner.
Yeah, you should have.
You know, after everything
you done for me, I...
It kills me to think
that I let you down.
But when it comes to Layla,
there is nothing in this world
that I wouldn't do
to protect her.
Well, Junior, here's the thing.
We've all got our blind spots.
All right?
The trick is making sure
you identify them,
and don't let them cloud
your decision-making process.
That's it. Understood.
Hey. I got something
for you guys to see.
Remember that cell phone that
pinged right after the heist?
The one that we assumed
belonged to whoever was planning
the whole thing? Yeah.
Well, I took a closer look
at the area
that it was last active,
and check this out.
Appears we've been looking
for the wrong kind of harbor.
Hey.
Five-O.
Got some pictures
for you to look at.
You recognize those guys?
Yeah, I recognize these guys.
They were here earlier today.
Uh, room 381.
Old dude rented it out
for the day, paid cash.
Didn't you find it
a little bit odd
that five grown men
would rent out
a single motel room
for the day? Mm-mm.
Hey, man,
we get all kinds of crazy here.
Stopped asking questions
about two weeks into this job.
All right, we're gonna
need to see that room.
No problem.
Housekeeping just finished up
in there, but it hasn't
been rented out yet.
So what's the plan?
Maybe get a CSU team down here,
have them sweep the room
to get about a thousand prints
from a thousand
different people,
many of whom will come back
with criminal records
due to the general scumbaggery
that goes on
in this establishment?
No offense. None taken.
You still got the key card
the old guy
turned in on checkout?
So, the print
from the key card came back,
and we have an ID.
The last person to rent the room
was a Robert Castor,
and... surprise, surprise...
He worked
as an armored truck driver
for Honolulu Armored Services.
He was printed as part
of his security check.
Here's another fun fact
about Castor:
He himself used to handle
the pickups
at Bank of Oahu
and Union Liberty.
Those robberies areconnected.
Starts out small,
just hitting up the tellers
at Union Liberty,
and then he graduates to robbing
the vault at Bank of Oahu.
Uses his inside knowledge
to put together the plan,
then hires a crew to do
the heavy lifting.
There's more.
According to employment records,
Castor retired six months ago,
but due to some contested
disciplinary action,
he was stripped of his pension.
There's your motive. We have a BOLO out
on Castor and his vehicle?
Even better.
HPD's at his house.
Just picked him up.
They're bringing him in.
Perfect.
We'll see you soon.
What is that?
Just got a text from Layla.
"Joon, I need to talk to you.
Meet me at Thomas Square Park
by the fountain, 30 minutes."
Mr. Castor.
We both agree that you seem
like a brass tacks kind of guy,
so we figured we'd just get straight
down to business, all right?
We know that you helped plan
the Union Liberty Bank heist
last week.
We also know that you were part
of the Bank of Oahu heist.
That left two people dead.
Those are both on your old, uh,
armored truck route, right?
You know, old-school guys,
they never talk. STEVE:
Unless, of course,
they know that we have evidence
that puts them dead to rights.
And then they usually figure out
it's in their best interest
to cooperate with us.
I don't think he knows
that we have his money yet.
Oh.
We got your money.
I probably should've opened
with that, right?
See, HPD, they tore
your place apart.
They didn't find your money,
but they did find
the key to a very large
safety-deposit box
registered over
at Certified National Bank.
That was a safe play.
I'll tell you what
else is a safe play.
You coming to the table first.
Now, why don't you
give us your crew
before they come in
and flip on you?
I'm sorry, is something funny?
You two, you think you got it
all figured out, don't you?
Huh?
You don't get to be my age
without learning a thing or two.
And one thing I do know is...
overconfidence
always sinks the ship.
♪
I'm sorry, Junior.
♪
I'll get him.
All right, I'm coming, I'm
coming.
Hey. What's wrong, huh?
Come here.
Come here.
Yeah.
Hey.
You all right?
Think he's hungry.
Hey...
Come on. Oh-ho-ho.
Baby, no. Come on, Kai.
Oh, no. Mm...
I have to go to work. Okay, babe.
Hey, uh, come. Come here.
Have a good day.
I love you.
I'm so proud of you.
Oh.
Okay, here we go... Time to eat.
♪
Remember who you're
doing this for.
You got a family to think about.
If we go down for this,
you're looking at 20 minimum.
You think they're gonna wait
around for you to get out?
Mm-mm.
Find out exactly
what the cops know.
Then kill him.
All right, Tory, it's over.
We know about Nick,
Owen and Kalino.
They're going away,
and so are you.
Castor made a deal,
but you can still save yourself.
Let me take you in.
If you cooperate,
I can get you a deal.
No, you're lying.
You're saying what you
think you need to say
so I don't kill you.
See, you almost had me.
But you made one mistake.
Layla never calls me Joon.
We need to bail, now.
If they take him in,
he's gonna roll on us.
You ain't no killer.
So Tory,
put that gun down, let's talk.
That's-that's it.
Put it down.
That's it.
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!
Junior.
We're good here.
HPD's on the way. Where are you?
I'm right on him. I got this.
Put the weapon down.
Now.
I can't go back to jail, man.
I can't do that kind
of time. I can't...
Okay, Tory, listen.
If you're not gonna do it for
yourself, then think about Kai.
All right?
Think about Layla.
They're all I ever think about!
What I did, man...
I did for them.
And I know that.
All right, Tory?
And they're gonna know that.
And you'll get to
see your son again.
And Layla's gonna forgive you.
Kai is gonna forgive you.
I can't live in a cage, man.
I can't let my little boy
see me live in a cage.
Put the gun down.
Tory, put the weapon down.
Tory?
No...
No.
No, don't you even
think about that.
Please. It's the only way, man.
No, brother, come on.
No.
Put the gun down.
Please.
Tory.
No, no, no, no, no!
I'm so proud of you.
No!
Okay. I'm right here,
buddy. I'm right here.
Come on... help!
Get an ambulance
right now! Move!
Tory. Hey.
Tory, come on.
Stay with me, buddy!
No! No!
We got a 10-71.
I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry.
Joons.
Hey. You know it's not
your fault, right?
There's absolutely
nothing you could've done
that would've
changed the result.
You know, when I left for Iraq,
it was only supposed
to be for one tour.
You know, I was just supposed
to go get experience
and qualify for GI benefits
and then come straight back home
and then I marry Layla.
That was the plan.
Until the plan changed.
What happened?
After my first tour, they asked
me to re-up, and I, uh,
I didn't hesitate.
Yeah, I mean, you, you were
doing what you loved to do.
Right. Right.
Meanwhile, the person
that I loved
was waiting on the other side
of the world,
for me.
In my head, I just thought,
you know,
we'd just pressed pause.
You know, all the time I was
away, I never questioned us,
not for one second.
You know, I thought that
we would just pick up
from exactly where I left off.
No.
For her, that wait was hard.
She was alone, and...
she grew sick of waiting for me,
feeling second best
to my life as a SEAL.
And then... then she met Tory.
You know, and he-he was there.
You know?
H-He was around.
I wasn't.
She ended it
with a letter, you know?
She wrote it to me
and she told me it was over.
Seven and a half thousand
miles away,
sitting underneath a wall
in a compound in Tagab,
and there was
nothing I could do.
When I came home and I found out
she was having Tory's baby,
oh...
Ugh...
You know, I...
I knew it'd be selfish of me
to fight for her.
Joons, I'm so sorry.
No...
You know, Tani, I've made some
mistakes in my life, but...
losing Layla, or, uh,
pushing her away, that was...
So when you say, uh,
there's nothing different
that I could have done...
yeah, I tend to disagree.
