            Mud. Hmmph.
            "Oyls."
            That explains it.

    They don't make 'em
    like they used to.
    Ohh!
        I'm sorry, mother,
        but it's ugly.
        I ask you, have you ever
        seen anything so ugly?
        I won't be engaged
        in this hat.
    I heard that.
    Don't think
    I didn't hear that!
    She owes me
    an apology.
Oh...ugly.
                There's nothing
                left to say.
                What
                do you think?
I think
it's up to you, dear.
            What do you think?
            Ugly!
            I think
            it's a conspiracy.
                Ohh...
Why would they manufacture
deliberate ugliness
    Unless they wanted me
        to look ugly?
We find that out,
we find out everything.
        There's a stranger
        in t--err, um...
    Ohh.
        I can't get engaged.
        You'll have to
        tell Bluto. I can't.
    We'll have to cancel
    the party tomorrow night.
        It's not my fault
        that it's so ugly.
        Oh! What are you doing
Listening in
on a private conversation
between me and my mother?
    I've a good mind to have
    my father call a policeman.
            Olive,
    Will you show mister...
        Mister...
            Oh. Popeye, ma'am.
        ...Mr. Eye
The spare room?
Go upstairs, mr. Eye.
Olive will show you the room.
    Thanks. Heh heh.
    Mmm. Comes close
    to an asylum here.
        Show me a room.
        Show me some courtesy.
        Might be nice.
I don't see why I have
to do anything
On the day before
my engagement party
When nothing's ready--
especially me.
And what kind of name
is that, anyway? "Popeye"?
Pretty strange.
        What kind of name
        is "Olive Oyl"?
        Sounds like some kind
        of lubricanks.
            Thank you very much,
            ma'am.
Don't look in that room.
That's <I>my</I> room.
        Meant no disrespect.
                Ugly, huh?
                You owe me
                an apology.
        What?
Who shoved a feather
in his ear?
                What'd you say?
Sure is nice weather
you have here.
Your name
really "Olives"?
                    So what?
"Olives Oyl"?
Ha ha.
You don't
look greek.
        So? You're short...
        Or you're just passing
        yourself off as short.
Can I see me room now?
            Oh, as if I cared...
Let me give you a hand there.
Maybe it needs a little oil.
                    No--oh!
                    Aah!
    Nice-lookin' room.
Mmm. Never seen a room done
in early demoliskin before,
But this'll do for me.
                Careful how you
                treat that bed.
                Nothing goes
                on this bed.
Sorry. I was just--
                Watch that lamp!
                Let me give you
Some assistance here.
Give me your hand.
There. That's it.
Yeah, here we are.
Oh, your underclothes.
    You--oh.
        I still respecks you.
                Oh!
        Me bad eye.
        I didn't see nothin'.
                    Hmph!
        Thanks for your help.
        Miss Oyl. Meybe--
Oh. Yes, uh,
that is my hat.
    Woman: don't forget
    to put the cat out, dear.
Man:
we don't have a cat.
         <I>"eau de toilette."</I>
            Yeah,
         <I>Eau de Toilette.</I>
    Yeah.
        Man:
        how do you like that?
        Gold's up 20 cents.
        $2.00 An ounce.
        I knew it!
        I knew it!
    I could've made
    a fortune on fillings
If Bluto would've let me go
directly to the Commodore.
He's so jealous of me,
that Bluto.
    Well, who wouldn't be?
Me, I'm not jealous
of Castor.
He's my son!
Man jealous
of his own son?
You owe me
an apology!
            I didn't mean you.
        Castor: never lets me
        go to the Commodore.
    Wimpy: the Commodore
    is a paragon of sagacity.
    If ever I could
    put in a good word--
        Shut up is the word!
        Pass is another word,
        But Wimpy,
        he don't pass.
        He should be killed.
    Mmm. I don't look
    as good as I smell.
        Too late now.
        Gotta go.
                Oh, mr. Eye...
    Popeye, ma'am.
            ...Have you met--
            uh, Pop--
            Meet Wimpy,
            my son Castor,
            Mr. Geezil,
            my husband Cole.
            We're all one big,
            happy family here...
    Hmmph.
            Although not really.
            I mean, um,
            Well, mr. Geezil
            and mr. Wimpy are--
Me, I'm family.
            Well,
            you're my husband!
    You owe me an apology.
                Olive: I can't
                find anything.
What are you
looking for, Olive?
                A glass.
Oh. Here's a glass.
        That's a short,
        fat, ugly glass.
        I want a tall, pretty,
        slender glass.
    They're all broken.
                I could've
                made a fortune
                in fish futures.
        Fish?
    Fish futures smell.
            What kind of glass
            do you want, Olive?
            A wine glass
            Or a brandy glass
            Or a water glass?
Oh, not a thing.
I don't want a thing.
                Real appetizing.
        I want a fork.
Right beside
your plate.
If it was a knife,
it would cut you.
Will you sit down,
mr. Eye, please!
    You owe me an apology.
        Mr. Geezil:
    pass the fish, please.
Fish!
Excellent idea.
Miss Oyl, I would suggest
before matrimony, fish.
Fish before matrimony.
    That does look good there.
    Wish I had a plate, though.
4 Times engaged
Is 3 times much.
    Olive: oh, he can't
    talk me out of anything.
    I'm not a child.
I'll say
you're not a child.
    Who says I'm not a child?
You said you're not a child,
and I agreed with you,
that's who.
    Who asked you
    to agree with me?
No one can stop me from
agreeing with you if I want.
Quarreling at my table.
You both owe me an apology.
    Sorry, Pop.
            What?
Please pass the shrimp,
chicken, and meatballs.
        Well...I don't know.
        Captain Bluto has
        the patience of job--
        He's certainly got
        a very good job--jobe.
        And he needs
        a lot of patience.
        Why, he runs this town
        for the Commodore
        while he's away,
        And the Commodore's
        always away.
        As a matter of fact,
        I've never seen him.
        Have you, Cole?
            I'd never let a girl
            break my engagement.
            I'd break her nose
            before she broke
            my engagement.
            And you better not
            try on me
            What you pulled
            on Bluto,
    Because I'm no pushover.
You owe your sister
an apology.
                Will you stop
                fidgeting?
            Olive:
    this knife won't cut.
                Here, take mine.
    Not since I was a child
    have we had sharp knives.
        You owe me an apology.
            You don't like
            our knives?
        Bluto's rich.
        He can buy you
        plenty of knives.
                Ohh. I hate
                this table.
                It's ugly.
        I'm the only one with
        nerve enough to tell
        the truth about it.
    Then why don't you let
    Bluto the pushover
    Buy you a new table?
    Am I right, Pop?
Right.
        I'm right? Right.
You're right.
                Wimpy:
                nothing left?
    Oh, Bluto, Bluto, Bluto!
Everyone takes advantage
of my poor Bluto!
Get a new glass,
a new knife...
Now they want a table!
Well, hmmph!
That's why I always have
to break off our engagement--
To stop you all
from taking advantage
Of the sweetest,
most humble man
on the face of this earth!
    Hmmph.
You make me sick.
            Never good to be
            too full, I guess.
                It's 9:00!
                Curfew!
        Lights out!
Woman, whispering:
you can have your kiss now.
    Oh!
            Poppa.
        Pretty soon
    You and me are gonna
    be together again, huh?
            Yeah.
    30 Years ain't that long.
            Besides...

        our annualversity.
        Yeah. Yeah.

                Hey, hey, hey!
                Laverne!
    Laverne!
            Give us a smooch!
            Ha ha ha!
I really need someone
to kinda talk to.
'Cause I thought everybody
in this town might be deef.
                    What's that?
You know, the gisk
of why I'm here is
I'm lookin'
for me Poppa.
    Yeah.
I've searched
the 7 seas for him,
And I haven't
found him yet.
I was only 2 years old,
me own Pap left me.
I was just
a mere infink.
Pipe down, will you?
Me own Pap ditches me.
I'm a very tolerant man,
Except when it comes
to holdin' a grudge.
I never thought
I'd forgive me Paps,
But about 7 years ago,
I ships out on this boat,
the    <I>gloomy gus.</I>
Just off the coast
of Guam,
But it breaks up
in this typhoon.
I'm stuck on this raft
for 45 days
Without food or waters.
But after all this time
on this raft,
This visiktation
comes to me.
Looks just like me mother,
rest her soul.
And it says,
"Your Pap
is still alive."
                Excuse me.
So when
I was finally rescued...
            I figured I gotta
            forgive me Paps,
            You know?
            You see,
            I'm only afeared
            he might be dead
            And never realize
            What a fine figure
            on an orphink
            I turned out to be.
            Oh, yeah.
        You sure got
    a nice-lookin' face there,
            One-eye!
                    One-eye?
I've seen better arms
on a baboon!
        You're a slime!
            You want to know why
            you're "loneskome"?
            Go take a look
            in that mirror!
        You know,
        if it's one ting I got,
        It's a sensk of humor.
Where did you get
that "pronunskiation"?
        Yeah! Got a Olive
        caught in your throat?
    Well, I'll
    get back to ya.
                Pappy.
                Dadda.
                I want my dadda!
        Yeah,
        if I were your daddy,
        I'd ship out, too!
                Yeah. You're
                too dumb-lookin'
                To leave
                on a doorstep!
Hah hah hah!
Hah hah hah!
                    Hey, runt!
                I'll bet
                your Pappy
                Is as ugly
                as you are.
Another thing I got...
Is a sensk
of humiligration.
Now, uh, maybe you swabs
can pool your intelligensk
And see that I'm askin' you
for an apolojagy.
                Heh heh heh.
                Hey, butch.
                Why don't you
                give daddy's boy
                An apology?
        With pleasure, spike.
        Heh heh heh.
The little one-eyed rat
wants an apology.
        Well, I would
        like to offer
        My most sincere
    and humfelt apologies.
You got it.
            Yikes!
    You apologize?
        I--I apologize.
Rosie, get my hat.
I think it's time we leave.
I've gotta get
back to the dairy--
    Aah!
                    Apologize!
            For what?
Hah hah hah!
Hah hah hah!
        All these idjits.
        This a smorgasbord
            of violence.
That's everybody.
                Everybody's
                apologized.
            Yeah, everybody's
            really sorry.
        Oh, everybody's
        really, really sorry.
            Now it's your turn
            to be sorry.
    Sorry I have to do this,
    but enough is enough.
    Oh...sorry.
Guess what!
Thanks.
Anybody else
want an apologigy?
            All in a day's fun,
            ain't it?
                Hup! Hey, why...
Anybody home?
            There you go.
            Sorry about that.
            Nah.
            Keep the change.
Remember, my dear,
        Tonight, it's my turn
        to be tall.
Very nice party,
I can't help
but feel sad, though.
                    Chico.
This is a sad day
for me.
            Chico,
    hand these things out.
        Make sure
    everybody gets one.
    Flowers--
    I forgot the flowers.
            Hmm.
            Yep...
        The solushkion.
        Look at that.
        Ah, me dress blues.
            Woman: it's Castor's
            favorite color.
    Oh, you and Castor.
Oh, phooey!
        We're just waiting
        for captain Bluto.
I can't tell you
how happy this makes me
To attend
miss Oyl's party.
Nice-lookin' furs
there.
    Oh.
    Boy, uh, I don't know
    when I've had this much fun
    And still been conscious.
    Well, better be on me way.
        Au reservoir.
            Heh heh.
    I didn't want to go
        to no party.
        That's good,
    'cause you ain't invited.
            Who says
        I ain't invited?
        I says.
        Who are you?
    You know who I am.
        I'm you.
Olive: ugly.
            Women: Bluto's ugly,
            all right.
Bluto's distinguished.
            He's distinguished,
            all right--
            Distinguishedly
            ugly!
Bluto's special.
            Oh, he's special,
            all right.
            Especially ugly.

                    Mrs. Oyl,
                    Olive's--
Olive's what?
    Olive's...
                    Olive's...
                Getting ready.
Getting ready.
            Good.
    Now, where were we?
                Uh, she <I>won't</I>
                <I>marry you...</I>
                    She...

                Ha ha ha!
                Ha ha...ohh!
                Here. Eat those.
        Mmm. Yeah, yeah.
        Ahh. Whew.
Thank you, mr. Slats.
        Mrs. Oyl: Olive!
No place to go.
Can't go to no party
without an invite.
                Whoo!
That's it! Come on!
Oh, ho, ho.
Whoa. Miss Oyl...
            You scared the wits
            out of me!
I almost knocked them
out of you, too.
        What right do you have
        to lurk in the dark
        And scare the wits
        out of a person?
    I wasn't.
I was just kind of...
How's your party goin',
miss Oyl?
            Oh, that's
            a dumb question.
        Where do you think
        I'm headed right now?
Uh, well, um...
That way, I think.
Out of town.
        I am not headed
        out of town!
        Don't you see which
        direction I'm facing?
Now you're facin'--
now you're facin' easterly.
There you go. Southwest.
Place your bets.
You need some help
with your bags, miss Oyl?
                    No.
I didn't touch you.
Didn't mean to hurt you.
                Thank you.
    Oh, you do.
Sorry about that.
Didn't mean to scares you.
                Oh...no, that's
                the wrong way!
        Yes.
    Sorry about that.
                No, that's
                the wrong way!
                I want to go...
                    Ooh! Ohhh!
            Whoo! Oh! Ohh!
        Ohh!
That way!
            That'll be 50 cents,
            Impersonating-
            a-traffic-cop tax.
    What?
            Oh, I'm sorry,
            miss Oyl.
            Didn't recognize you
            from the back.
            Won't happen again.
        How come miss Oyl don't
        have to pay no taxes?
                That's 10 cents.
                Question tax.
        I'll give you
        somethin' to tax.
                I'll let you off
                this time
                Since you're
                with miss Oyl.
                Good night,
                miss Oyl.
            How come bein'
            with miss Oyl
            Means you don't have
            to pay no...taxes?
Well, I don't know what
you're talkin' about.
        Here's a nice cup of tea
        for you, captain Bluto,
        While you're waiting.
Bluto:
where's Olive?
                    Olive?
You think everyone
pays taxes
But me and my family,
don't you? Hmm.
Well, you couldn't
be more wrong.
        If I'm wrong,
        why am I on your right?
You think because
I'm engaged to Bluto
And Bluto runs the town
for the Commodore,
So we get special favors.
Well, it's a lie.
            Olive!
        Bluto is kind
        and generous
        And likes to do things
        for his loved ones.
        And you want me
        to hurt his feelings.
        Well, phooey on you.
        You don't care enough
        about me or my family
        To be at
        my engagement party.
        And what are you doing
        in Sweethaven, anyway?
Well, um,
I'm lookin' for me Pap.
            Well,
            if that's true,
            then where is he?
Well, uh,
you got me there.
I don't really know.
I got this sensk that
he's here, though, you know?
            Well, all right,
            I'll wait.
            There are too many
            guests as it is.
            Half of them I hate.
        One thing I remember
        about me Pap
        Was he always used to
        throw me up in the air.
        But he'd never be there
        when I'd come down.
            Yeah.
        Boy, he had a sense
        of humor, didn't he?
        Yeah, that was me Pap.
        I remember that time
        He gave me an electric
        eel as a toy.
        Eep! Yeah, that was fun.
            He'd rock me
            in my cradle real,
            real, real hard,
        And I'd lose me formula.
        Then he'd say, "one day
        you'll be a sailor."
        Heh heh.
        That's what I am today.
        Sometimes,
        He'd bounce me
        on his knee.
        Most of the time
        he'd miss, though.
        Couldn't see too well
        with one eye.
        Oh, me Pap. Yeah.
Well, I'm not waiting
any longer. Hmm.
        Oh. Sorry, miss Oyl.
            You almost...
                Ho ho!
    Mm-hmm...
        Me train of thought
        kinda derailed and...
        Oh, yeah.
        All that time waitin'.
        I've been waitin'--
What are you doing
with that basket?
            Well, I'm--
            I'm carryin' it.
            It's your basket,
            ain't it?
It is not my basket.
Somebody has deliberately
painted that basket
To look like my basket.
My basket was clean
and beautiful,
And this basket
is ugly.
Yikes! Rattlesnake!
            Miss Oyl,
            We should at least
            have dinner first.
                    Rattlesnake!
                Rattlesnake?!
                Where is it,
                miss Oyl?
                Is it in there?
                Don't worry,
                miss Oyl.
                I've handled
                vermins before.
                I'll rattle
                that snake
                Till it's
                a pair of shoes.
            That's it, I'll...
                I'll rattle him
                upside-down.
ohh! Ohh!
                I'll get to him.
                Come on. Hup!
    Aah!
                    Hey!
    Ohh!
                Ohh...
        Ohh...
                Blow me down.
                    Ohh...
            Here you go,
            little tyke.
            Here's your snake.
            There you go.
            What do you
            got here?
            "To the one-eyed
            sailor."
            That must be me.
            Wait a minute.
            Hold on there.
            Watch out. I don't
            wanna hurt you.
                Hi.
            I'll read this.
            I'll bring it
            right back to you.
        Oh, I ain't that ugly.
        It's all right.
        Ohh. It's ok.
        ¶ I am, I am, I am
            I'm all right.
                Hey...
                It's ok.
            Hey, hey, hey.
        We're together in this.
        Mm-hmm.
            All right.
        "I must trust someone
        with my baby..."
    Baba.
        You're a baby.
        It says right there.
        "I must trust someone
        with my baby
        "Until I frees meself
        "Of certain financial
        obligations,
        "Which will take
        25 years or so,

Of course I know the words.
It's our national anthem.
            Ah-ah-ah-ah.
            That'll be
            62 cents--
            Going to an illegal
            sporting event.
If it's illegal,
how come it's goin' on?
    Ladies and gentlemen,
    Citizens of Sweethaven,
    Who will be the only
    mortal in our midst
    To attempt to last
    one scandalous round
        With that ugliest
        of plug-uglies,

    There's Castor.
Oh, my god!
That's Castor!
    Mom, Pop, I'm gonna
        fight him.
Oh, get my baby
out of there.
Don't touch his feet.
He's gotta dance
with those feet!
        I can do it!
            Olive, do something
            about this.
            Get your brother
            out of this.
            I can't stand
            much more of this.
            Where are my pills?
Man: get him
out of there!
        Gentlemen,
    you know the rules.
        There are no rules.
        This is a fight
        to the finish.
    First man who's dead
            loses.
            Good luck
        to both of you!
Did you see
what he was doing?
You didn't see?
                Good luck
                to you.
I hate you to pieces!
                Now, don't--
                Don't kill him.
                Just fluff him
                up a bit.
            Castor! Castor,
            get out of there!
Go for him

Pleased to meet you.

His mother's
distracting you.
            I can't bust him.

            He's got

Dizzy dame.
One day, Swee'Peas,
he's gonna go to school
        And bust bigger kids
        in the mush.
        Yeah. You like that,
        don't youse? Yeah.
And we'll move into

On a shady lane,
And we'll garden together,
And we'll play house.

I hope the taxes

        Oh, the main thing is
        that you're all right.
            Yeah.
Was you worried that I mighta
gotten killed or somethin'?
                Oh, Popeye,
                don't be silly.
                I knew.
You didn't have
no confidinks.
            Oh, I did, too.
            I did, too...after
            I asked Swee'Pea.
Oh, ho ho!
That's rich.
You're really
a dizzy dame.
            I asked Swee'Pea,
            and he told me.
            Isn't that so?
        What did he say?
                See? I asked
                Swee'Pea,
            "Swee'Pea, will
            Popeye be killed?"
    Uh-uh.
                No?
So then I asked,
"Swee'Pea,
Will Popeye be
seriously maimed?"
                        No?
        That's 2 for 2.
        That can happen
        anyway, you know?
            So then I queried,
            "Swee'Pea,
            Will Popeye
            actually survive?"
            What?
            You mean he'll win?
Ohhh...
        That's a neat trick.
        Me infink is
        a psychik of prophecks.
        If I hadn't seen it
        with me own eye,
        I wouldn't believe it.
                    That kid's
                    a regular
                    forecaster.
        Remind me to ask
        him about gold futures.
    I'm more interested
    in talking to him
    about immediate futures.
    Um, Popeye.
    He's an adorable
    little fellow.
                He's a psychiks,
                too. Ain't that
                the truth?
        But he looks
    a little Peaked to me.
    He needs some air.
                Air? That's all
                we have here.
            With your
            permission, Popeye,
            I'll take him
            for a walk.
                Well, why not?
                You're
                his uncle Wimp.
                There you go.
        Come along.
                Don't forget
                his little hat.
                He's goin' out
                in uniform.
                    Oh,
                    of course.
                    Thank you.
Ain't that something?
He's takin' him
for a walk.
Hey, are you tryin'
to pull a fast one?
He can't walk yet.
    Oh, I'll carry him.
In that case,
it's all right.
Just don't
drag him.
            I want to carry him
            for a walk.
Oh, leave him be.
It's uncle Wimpy
carryin' Swee'Pea.
            Wimpy can take him,
            but I can't?
Who says you can't?
            You said I can't.
That was before.
                    Before what?
    Well...
Before I, uh, knew
you was worried about me.
                Oh.
            You mean now
            I can carry him
            Just because I was
            worried about you?
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
                    Phooey.
"Phooey"? Y-you say
"phooey" to me?
            I said "phooey,"
            and I mean "phooey."
                Phooey.
Ha ha. She said...
"Phooey" to me.
We have Lickety Split,
number one,
Number 3,
Sand Crab.
How about 6?
    Popeye: everything's
    gonna be all right.
        Now, he's with
        his uncle Wimps,
    And they've only been gone
    for a couple of hours.
    Wait a minute. This town
    could've been built
    In a couple of hours.
            Ooh!
    I gotta be trustworthy.
    Wimps is trustworthy.
    Wait. I trust him as far
    as I can throw him.
        I don't see
        him anywhere.
            Maybe they went
            to the roughhouse.

                That rat Wimpy!
    What's this got
    to do with Swee'Pea?
        They've gone
        to the races.
                A baby
                at the races!

    Yippee! We did it!
        Oh, that Wimps.

        Therefore, a racetrack
        ain't no nurskery!
    Oh, patience, patience.
    Gotta remain calm.

                Straight ahead.
Woman:

You like

No. Number 2, ed?
    Ed?

Holy moley?

            Hurray!
        We've done it.
    Popeye: what is this,
    a house of ill repukes?
    Who'd bring an infink
    in a den of immoraliky?
    Don't touch anythink.
Might get a venerable disease.
            Ooh. Is that
            a bad toy you got
            in your pocket?
    Hello.
Got to gird your loins up
for this one.
            Raise your paper,
            Cole.
        Oh! Would you--
If Mom caught me here,
she'd kill me.
There's Mom.
            Where is that Wimpy?
                        Ohh...
                    Castor,

                    doing here?
    I've been behind you
        all the time.
            110,

            Wimpy,
            I'm disgustipated
            with you.
            May I borrow
            the infink
            for a Moment?
    Yes, just a Moment.
            I don't want you
            to lose Swee'Pea.
            I ought to bust you
            right in the mush.
    Yeah, what is this?!
It's 120 simoleons.
        You won 120 simoleons?
You know how many
hamburgers that is?
        Disgraceful!
        How many races?
    2 Races.
Hmm. Let me see
that racing form.
Oh, Swee'Pea.
                No child of mine
                is gonna be
                a racking tout.
                    Come on,

Duck your head.
            What are you
            doin', there?
        No childs of mine
        will be exploiticated
        For ill-gotten gains.
It's
good-gotten gains.
This gains will
feed us and save us.
            Wrong is wrong, even
            if it helps you.
Family is more important
than dumb morality.
Oh, look. He's got
something in his eye.
Let me see.
                Oh, I know

    Sometimes you gotta do
    tings you don't want to do.
Oh, it's cruel,
mr. Eye--
Uh, mr. Pop--
uh, mr. Popeye.
    I'm sorry, mrs. Oyl,
    but it's a parent's duty
        To protect me
        adopticated son
        from child abuske.
Oh, but think of Olive.
You can't take him
away from poor Olive.
    Me morality ain't bilge,
    mrs. Oyl.
    When me mind's set,
    I don't change for nothin'.
        You sure about that?
        Yeah, I think so, yeah.
Cole: maybe we owe him
an apology.
        We'll find another place
        to plant ourselves.
            You all right there?
            This ain't bad,
            is it?
            It ain't the ritz,
            but at least
            You get a little
            womb service.
            It ain't no palatial
            mansion, either,

            Got your
            blankets here.
            Yeah, there we goes.
            Got your blankets.

                $4.25
                Movin'-out tax.
Nuts to you and
nuts to your taxes.
                Moved in here?
What's it look like?

                Movin'-in tax.
Double nuts.
                Where's

        Echo: Swee'Pea!
        It's me own fault
        Swee'Pea's
        been kidnapped.
        Olives was right.
        Even an orfink needs
        a mother and a father.
        If I was gonna be
        Swee'Pea's mother,
        I should at least
        let her be his father.
        Or viska verska.
            I ain't man enough

                    You found
                    me Swee'Pea?
            Oh, shh!
Your father.
                You found
                me father!
            No...yes!
            Oh, oh...
            You tell him!
    Uh...
        No, I'll tell him.
        Oh, no, don't
        tell him.
            What did you find?
            Me Swee'Pea
            or me father?
Uh, more
than that.
            You found me father
            and me Swee'Pea!
Commodore.
    No. Oh...
            You found me father,
            me Swee'Pea,
            and the Commodore.
And captain Bluto!
                That's a real
                cruel joke.
    Your father's a rat!
    A crook
    and a kidnapper!
    He's on the Commodore's boat
    with Bluto and Swee'Pea!
    That's what
    I can't tell you.
                No, he ain't.
    Oh, yes, he is.
                No, he ain't.
                Me father ain't
                no kidnapper!
    Ohhh...he is, too.
    He's a rat, a crook,
    A kidnapper,
    a bad father,
    and more!
                    More?
It apPears
your father
is the Commodore.
        Lies, lies.
        There ain't no
        dad-blasted treasure.
    Kid...
        This is
    a crucial question.
    Listen close.
    Can you lead me to
    the old goat's treasure?
                Don't tell him,
                You little
                rat fink!
                Arrrhhh!
        He ain't no Commodores.
        A hoity-toity Commodore?
        He would never be that.
    A rat, a crook,
    a kidnapper,
     <I>and</I> the Commodore!
            I don't listen
            to the advice
            of some dizzy broad.
            They ain't there,
            and I'll prove it!
            Now, where
            ain't they?
They ain't on
the Commodore's boat.
        That's where they ain't?
        That's where I'll prove
        they ain't! Come on.
    Popeye, wait a minute!
All: go get 'em, Popeye!
    My husband's delegated me
    to say he's behind you!
        I'd go, but I must
        shave and shampoo.
    Give 'em hell, Popeye!
    Kick 'em in the butt!
        Count on me.
I'd go with you,
but I gotta lock up.
    You know I'd go.
I'd go, Popeye, but--
Man: if I wasn't afraid
of the water, I'd go.
                Clean up
                on them, Popeye!
No way I'll go,
but good luck!
        Popeye:
    this where he ain't?
            I know
        you ain't down there.
    It ain't him, is it?
            Now...
        Where ain't youse?
        Where ain't
        me Swee'Pea?
            What's that?
            What? Who?
                    Pappy?
                    Pap?
                    Poppa?
                    Poppa!
I ain't
nobody's Poppa!
You one-eyed, fish-faced,
sissipated sniffle-snaffle!
            Oh, ho, I knew it!
            I knew it!
            I found youse!
I hate this!
I am disgustipated!
Uhh! Uhh!
Nuts to you!
Phooey! Phooey! Phooey!
            Oh, you did a good--
            Oh, Poppa!
            Poppa, Poppa, Poppa!
            All that time!
            It's me, it's me,
            your own big son!
Stand to,
you swab!
                    Yes, sir!
You're castin' shadows
on poopdeck Pappy,
Pride of the paciferic
and father to the shark,
Brother
to the pyranica,
Cousin
to the killer whale,
And uncle
to the octopussy!
    Uhh! Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!
    Uhh! Uhh!
But, Pap,
I'm your one
and only ex-spring.
We got
the same bulgy arms.
                No resemblance.
We got the same
squinky eye!
            What squinky eye?
Could be
hard to see.
We got
the same pipe, Pap.
                You idiot!
                You can't
                inherit a pipe!
I ain't Poppa to
no male or female child
That no court could
prove otherwise!
    Ohh...
    Ohh...
    Ohh...
There's one way to
prove I ain't your father!
Pick up
that can of spinach!
Pick it up!
                    Now bring it
                    over here.
                    Now, eat it.
    Eat it?
                    Eat it!
        Raw?
                    Eat it raw!
            Eat that spinach!
I don't want to!
                Eat that
                spinach, brat!
I don't want to!
            Eat that spinach!
    Waaaaa!
            You
            disobedient brat!
    Waaaaaa!
            You was disobedient
            when you was 2,
                And you're still
                disobedient now.
            You wouldn't
            eat your spinach.
        Spinach kept our family
        strong for many years,
        And what does me only
        offspring do with it?
            He spits it out!
Pllaaahh!
                Plaaahh!
            His mother dies,
            and he wouldn't eat
            his spinach!
        His Poppa outta woik,
            And he wouldn't eat
            his spinach!
            The whole country
            in a depressigan...
            Euhhhh...
            And he wouldn't
            eat his spinach!
        His Poppa going hungry,
        going off to steal.
        Stealing what?
Spinach!
                    Spinach!
        So his ungrate son
        could grow up
        big and strong.
        You know what I done
        when the g-men
        cotched me
        And thrung me in jail?
        I laughed.
            I laughed
            a whole year.
That's me Poppa.
                Ha ha ha ha ha!
He's gettin' away
with that rotten little
infink of a stool pigeon!
                Cut you down?
        Cut me down!
                Cut you down!
Cut me down!
        Ooohhh!
            I, uh...
            Cut you down, Poppa.
You idiot.
                Well, you said
                cut you down.
I didn't say
cut me down!
I said,
"get me down!"
Oh, unhand me, you brute!
            Oh, what
            are you doing?
                What--oh--
And don't you ever
pick up another knife.
If you do,
I'll make you eat it.
You will be known as
the sword-swallowin' sailor.
That's me Paps.
I know it is.
            Ooohh! What is all
            this brightness?
            I can't see!
    Popeye!
                        Popeye!
        All hands on deck!
            Oh, no!
        Ha ha ha ha!
            He's got them!
            Bluto's got Olive
            and Swee'Pea!
    Olive!
            Help!
            Popeye!
Olive! Olive!
            I've got
            all of you--
    Yay!
                    Yay, Popeye!
The wharf!
The wharf is moving!
            Shut up, stupid!
I'm comin', Olive!
Get away
from the boat!
        Ha ha ha ha!
Hoist the mainmast!
            Hurry up, Popeye!
         You're falling behind!
            And Bluto's
            gettin' away...
            Yeah, with us!
                Help!
What is it?
It's a rock.
It's a hard place.
            Oh, no!
            It's scab island!
            Ooohhhh!
    Don't worry, Castor.
    Your father's with us.
            S-s-scab
            Island!
                Haul ass!
                Get to your
                battle stations.
            Ooh...
            Phooey!
        What are you doin'?
        What are you doin'?
        Who do you think
        you are--captain arab?
        Olive oil.
        Swee'Pea.
        What are you doin'?
        Making the salads?
        I want me treasure!
        Do you hear me?
        I want me treasure!
        I'm the Commodore
        of this ship,
        And don't you
        give orders!
Oh, yeah? I'm the Commodore
of me friends.
You command this privy,
And I'll commands
me friends.
        Is that any way to talk
        to your father?
You ain't my father.
Me father
was tall and kind.
He looks like
abraham lincoln.
            Yeah? Don't tell me
            what I yam.
            Huh? Where'd he go?
            Where'd he go?
            I says
            I am your father.
            I ought to know
            whose father I is
            And whose father
            I ain't.
Who says?
        I says. I says!
I says avast,
you old bilge rat,
Before I use you
as an anchor.
            Bilge rat?
            Bilge rat?
            Mutiny. Mutiny.
            I am your one
            and only father.
            Look. Look.
            The same
            bulgy arms.
No resemblink.
        The same squinky eye.
What squinky eye?
        Help, Popeye!
            Ohh!
We even got
the same pipe. Look.
This ain't me pipe.
I've never seen anything
like this before in me life.
Talkin' to your poor
old father like that.
You disobedient brat.
You're spoiled,
that's what you are--
Spoiled.
Children. Children.
    Kids.
Ah, phooey!
Phooey!
Give 'em everything
they want...
And what do you get
in return? Nuts!
Nothin' but heartache.
Heartache, sadness,
and miserky.
Once in a while when you
try to give them a bath,
And they don't want it.
And another bath time
when you want to do something
That you really want to do,
But all they want to do
isn't what you want to do!
Bless their little hearts,
if they were made out of gold,
I'd like to sell 'em
on the open marketplace.
I could make me a fortune!
        Kids!
Ahh, they don't know
what they're doin'.
        Kids.
Dad-blast 'em, they're
gonna lead you to ruin.
That's what
they're gonna do,
lead you to ruin.
They cry at you
when they're young,
They yell at you
when they're older,
They borrows from you
when they're middle-aged,
And they leave you
alone to die without
even payin' you back!
Children! Phooey! Pbbllt!
You give them
everything they want,
And what do you
get back in return?
You get nothin'!
        Help me.
            Why, they're just
            smaller versions
            of us, you know.
            But I'm not
            so crazy about me
            in the first place.
            So why would I
            want one of them?
            I ask you! Children!
            Ahh, children.
            Little children.
            You pour your heart
            out to 'em,
            Give 'em everything
            they want,
            Give 'em candy
            and a lot of toys,
    And what do you get back?
    A lot of noise!

Come on, haul ass!
Haul ass!
Get the cannon

        The cannon?
            What are you doin'?
            You can't fire that!
            There's womens
            and infinks
            on that boat!
        All I'm going to do
        is fire a warning shot
        Right across the bow.
        Don't you thinks
        I knows what I'm doin'?
        Ahh! Short!
        I was a little short.
        Reload it.
            No, you don't!
    Dad-blast it, I missed!
        Full speed ahead!
            Slow down
            so we can board her.
We're not boarding her!
I'm gonna ram him!
He's not gonna get away
with my treasure!
    Ha ha! Pirates' cove!
    I should have known it.
All right, mr. Mean--
Because that's your name
from this day forward!
You've broken
your bale of straws
On   <I>thi</I>camel's back!
To think I
was gonna get engaged
to you again!
            Never more I say!
            Never more!
Get the water
out of the boat!
            Lower the lifeboats!
            Old women first!
Get the water
out of the boat!
            Women first!
                Aah!
Now, listen, kid.
This is the most important.
Is the treasure

            Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You'd better let me
out of here!
            Ok, kid.
            You watch the boat.
            I'm goin' in.
Wait a minute!
Where are you going?
                    We're almost
                    there.
We're almost

Let me out of here!
I'm all wet!
Ooh! Ooh!
Oop! There are

Olive: ha! You're

            You can't wins
            'cause you're bad,
            And the good
            always wins
            over the bad.
    Oh, yeah?
            Yeah!
