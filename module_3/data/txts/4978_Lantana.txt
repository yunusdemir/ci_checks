Oh, yeah.
- You OK?
- Yeah, I've lost my earring.
- What's it look like?
- It's a pearl one.
Oh, it should turn up.
Yeah, I'm just fond of them
because my husband gave them to me.
- You should probably go.
- Yeah.
I, uh...
I really enjoyed that.
Yeah, so did I.
They're so good.
Leon, Leon...
This is about sex, it's about a man
and a woman joined groin to groin.
You get it?
No.
Like this.
- Mum!
- I'm in here.
I haven't got any clothes.
I mean, clean ones.
- You pick them up, I'll clean them, OK?
- Yeah.
- Why are you jogging, Dad?
- To get fit.
- Yeah, what for?
- I don't wanna die.
- You are gonna die.
- I don't wanna die yet.
- Mum, clothes?
- Then stop jogging.
Hello? Mum, clothes?
What am I gonna wear?
- See you, Mum.
- Bye.
- See you, Dad.
- See you, mate.
- Have a good day.
- OK, you too.
- See you, Dad.
- Hey. What about me?
- Dad, I'm 16 now.
- So you're a man now?
Well, no, but...
- Have a good day, Dad.
- Yeah, you too.
Is there some point
where a son stops kissing his father?
Apparently.
Police!
He's in here!
- You went in a bit hard.
- The guy deals drugs. He's scum.
- But he wasn't going anywhere.
- What do you expect me to do?
You seeing anyone?
Not with the hours I keep.
- Could be somebody on the force.
- Male cops are lousy in bed.
There is someone.
- He eats in the same restaurant I do.
- You spoken to him yet?
We've exchanged...glances.
- Ooh.
- It's a start.
- How's Sonja?
- She's good.
- Haven't seen her for a while.
- Yeah...
She's busy, you know,
with the boys and work.
- Tell her I said hi.
- I will.
Have you told him
you're not happy?
I would've thought that maybe
he wouldn't need to be told.
That depends on
how good an actor you are.
Well, I guess I must be pretty good.
How do you want your marriage to be?
Passionate.
And...
and challenging and...and...honest.
Isn't it honest?
Not emotionally.
Not emotionally, it isn't.
It just feels...
like we're...you know,
like we're just...
..going through the motions, you know?
And I want more.
I want more than that.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
Dr Valerie Somers.
Thank you. Thank you.
We don't know what to feel any more.
We don't know
what's right or wrong any more.
The confused cry of the modern age.
We ask, "What can we believe in?
What should we believe in?"
Our politicians?  Hardly.
Our priests?
You'd be amazed
how many clients come see me
because they once believed in priests.
It's not supposed to be that way but it is.
What, then? Our parents?
Home is a sanctuary.
For a privileged few.
For most it's a battleground.
It's not meant to be like that but it is.
Love? Can we believe in love?
Feel safe in it?
Loving someone means
we have to relinquish power,
it's mutual surrender.
But how can this take place?
Trust.
Trust is as vital to human relationships
as breath is to life.
And just as elusive.
Two years ago
my 11-year-old daughter was murdered.
Her name was Eleanor.
This wasn't supposed to happen...
..but it did.
It seemed to go well.
I was worried
you weren't going to be there.
I said I would be.
Do you want a whisky?
I've got an early client.
Why don't we take separate cars
in the morning?
That way you won't
have to wait for me in town.
It's fine, I've got plenty of work I can do,
you can pick me up
after your meeting.
Sure.
OK.
I met someone.
We went home and had sex.
As you do. Well, some of us do.
And he asked to see me again.
I wasn't expecting that.
And?
Well, against my better judgment
I said yes.
Anyway, we've, um...
been seeing each other for a while.
And you like him?
Yes, I do. Very much.
So?
He comes encumbered...
with a wife.
Is he gay?
When he's with me he seems to be.
Does she know about you?
I assume so.
She would sense it, wouldn't she?
It depends on how good he is
at deceiving her.
Or how good she is at deceiving herself.
Hi, Nik.
You havin' a party in there, Jane?
Yeah. Did you wanna join me?
Take this inside for Mummy, come on.
Well?
Where?
In a motel.
Oh!
Did you get his number?
- Is that what you do?
- I don't know!
- But if you like the guy...
- Mm.
But he's married.
Oh...
Well, what? He's not happy?
He can't be, can he, if he's, you know,
messing around.
You gonna see him again?
Do you think I should?
- Want me to be honest?
- No. No.
When you gonna take that thing off?
It's too tight. I've got to get it cut off.
Mm.
Nik caught up with Pete the other day.
He wants to come back.
I don't love him, Paula.
Go up to his table
and ask if you can join him.
- What have you got to lose?
- Dignity.
That's not an issue -
the man eats on his own.
- So do I.
- Exactly.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Uh...
- Jane, this is Claudia. Claudia, Jane.
- Hi.
Hi.
Jane's in the same dance class
as Sonja and I.
I'll get going. Say hi to Sonja.
- Bye.
- See you.
Sorry, was that really awkward?
No. No, it's fine.
- So how are you?
- I'm good. Yeah.
Good, good.
But look, I'd better go.
Jane, er...
Ooh!
- Where'd you find it?
- Er...
Paula, there's an unmarked police car
in front of Jane's place.
- So?
- What, is she seeing a cop now?
Be nice, Nikky.
Her and Pete getting
back together or what?
What if they are? What do I say then?
Nothing.
Well, he's a...he's a mate of mine.
Do them a favour
and stay out of it, all right?
- Baby asleep?
- Yeah.
Oh, shit...
Oh, fuck, sorry.
Don't stop! Don't stop, don't stop.
- Oh, no...
- Leon?
- Oh, fuck!
- You all right?
- What is it? What is it?
- It's nothing.
- Should I call...? What...?
- No, no, I just get...
- Should I get a doctor?
- No, I get this chest pain sometimes.
You should have told me
that you've, um, got a weak heart.
- I don't.
- I don't want an affair with...
I don't have a weak heart!
And this is not an affair, it's
a one-night stand that happened twice.
Oh, shit.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.
That's OK.
Do you ever worry
that we don't make love very often?
No.
I mean, I don't really
think about it that much.
Why not?
I love you. Whether we make love
three times a week
or once a month doesn't change that.
Doesn't it?
- Is this a test?
- No!
I just wanna know what you're thinking.
Why do women
always want to know that?
You're up late.
Yeah, I'm just trying to finish this.
- You want one?
- I've got one.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
Just had a shit of a day... Stopped off
and had a drink with Claudia.
Yeah, I know. I phoned her.
Didn't know if you were working late.
Fuck! Fuck! Oh...
Oh! You fucking stupid bastard!
What the fuck is wrong with you?!
Fucking look where you're going!
Fucking idiot! Agh...
Fuck.
Oh, fuck.
Hey! Wait, wait, wait. Are you all right?
Sorry. Look, here's your bag.
Jesus!
- What happened?
- I fell.
- Are you all right?
- It's nothing.
Let me look.
I'm all right. Look, I said I'm all right!
- I keep thinking about her.
- Feeling guilty?
- You think I should be?
- It doesn't matter what I think.
He feels...manipulated by her.
- How?
- She's very needy.
- Are you trying to justify his deceit?
- No, to understand it. It's complex.
Mm-hm, but it's still an act of deceit.
No marriage can be based on that.
Most marriages
are based on that, Valerie.
Do you think you know
what goes on in most marriages?
- Since I'm gay I can't have an opinion?
- That's not what I'm saying.
She's not the victim,
she chose to marry him.
- Not knowing he was gay.
- There's knowing and knowing.
What do you mean?
I think some women like to live the lie.
It's easier than the truth.
Maybe she loves him.
But so do I.
Then he has to make a choice.
Unless one of us
withdraws from the contest.
Is love a contest for you, Patrick?
Patrick?
Yes.
Sometimes.
What happened to your head?
Bumped it on the clothesline.
Listen, um...thanks for last night.
I'll lie for you to anyone except Sonja.
I won't do it again.
Fair enough.
Why are you trying so hard
to fuck up your life?
You're lucky
to have the marriage you've got.
And you're pissing all over it.
It's great your husband comes.
Yeah.
- What about yours?
- I'm separated.
Ah.
- Can you tell?
- No. No.
You just have this kind of look.
- Oh, what, desperate?
- No.
Full of potential.
Sorry I'm late.
- Jane, my husband, Leon.
- Hi.
Yeah, hi.
Everybody, there is a salsa
band playing tonight at the Latin.
Leon, Sonja, are you guys coming?
- I thought we'd have a quiet dinner.
- Come on, Leon, you can eat any time.
- I'd like to go.
- I'm kinda tired.
OK. I'll see you at home. Bye.
- What the hell was that about?
- She needed a partner.
- And you just happened to volunteer?
- She chose me.
I'd never say anything, Leon.
- Pete!
- Oh, g'day, Nik. How are you, mate?
Just dropped over to see Jane.
She's not in. You seen her tonight?
- No.
- You don't know where she is?
No. No, sorry.
- How is she?
- The last time I saw her, OK.
- How you goin'?
- Yeah, good. Good.
It's late. I thought she'd be home by now.
No, sorry, mate, I haven't seen her.
Mate, if there was something
I should know you'd tell me, right?
Cos if she's seeing someone
I'd wanna know, it'd just be easier.
Of course.
I hate this.
- Thanks, mate. I'll see you later.
- Take care.
So why did you
and your husband split up?
Um... I don't know,
I just turned round one day
and I realised that I was living with a man
I just didn't love any more.
- It was that simple?
- No.
But you knew that much.
Maybe my expectations were too high.
You're a brave woman.
You are. Most people settle for less.
I really like you, Leon.
Maybe a little too much.
But I'm...
I'm starting to wonder...just...
where this might go.
I'm still in love with my wife, Jane.
- Right.
- I'm sorry.
So...
Then why...
why do you want to see me
if you're still in love with your wife?
I don't know, sorry.
It's not something that I planned.
Look, Jane, um...
This doesn't have to end badly.
Just go.
Just go. Go.
It's twofold. He thinks he runs the faculty
but he hasn't published
anything decent since 1985.
You seem preoccupied.
I, erm, I'm having trouble with a client.
I'm not handling him very well.
Refer him on.
- I find him a little threatening.
- Why?
I don't like...what he's doing.
You're judging him.
Darling, you have to refer him on.
See you outside.
Excuse me.
I hate what's happening to us,
I hate it, I...
We don't talk any more.
We lost our daughter.
That could've brought us closer.
Do you think about her very much?
Of course I do. I just don't need
to write a book about it.
Do you think I did the wrong thing?
I just...wanted the whole...
world to know.
Look at me, John.
Look at me.
Come on, kids,
we're late for school!
Watch the road!
Come on, in you get.
- Put your belt on.
- You know how to do it.
Hi!
Hi.
- You OK?
- Yeah.
I'll pop round after work.
OK.
Bye. Bye-bye.
- Hey, Nik, you want a coffee?
- Oh, yeah, sure.
Pete was over last night.
How is he?
Not good.
Hey, how's the job hunting going?
You guys all right for money?
Yeah.
Yeah? Cos if you need some
I'd be more than happy to...
No.
- I know Paula wouldn't take it.
- She's doing extra shifts.
Are you sure there isn't
a bill to clear?
It's fine.
Well, the offer's there.
- Thanks.
- That's all right.
Why didn't you wake me up?
I thought you could do with the rest.
- I'll go have my shower.
- I've got an early start.
- I'll only be ten minutes.
- Just take your own car.
- Oh, come on, wait for me, please?
- Jesus.
Sorry.
I have a lecture tonight anyway.
So you'll be home late?
Yeah.
Bye.
I think he's...
having an affair.
He's distant, preoccupied -like he's
holding something back from me.
What would you do if he was?
I-I...I think I'd leave.
And does that scare you?
Yeah. I'm...I'm...
I'm middle-aged, I don't know
what it's like out there, you know?
And I have these two...
beautiful boys.
But I, um...
I would survive if I had to.
Mm-hm.
Because I like being this age
and I...
I like the lines around my eyes.
I don't know if he does but...
I do.
It's not...
It's not that he might have...
slept with another woman.
It's that he might not tell me.
That would be the betrayal.
Do you still love him?
'- Valerie?
- Patrick is here.'
Give me a minute, OK?
You don't like me, do you, Valerie?
Is it important to you?
What if I was straight?
I don't have a problem
with your sexuality.
But it is a problem that I'm having
an affair with a married man?
Stop trying to make me the subject,
it's just another form of defence.
I'm curious about your role
in this triangle.
My role?
I'm a...a respite from a marriage
that's gotten too hard.
- How?
- He takes refuge in me.
- In what I offer him.
- What do you offer him?
Sex unencumbered by need.
Why doesn't he leave her?
- Good men don't know how to.
- Good men or cowardly men?
He told me that
making love to her was like...
trying to fill an empty well.
- What'd you say?
- What?
- You said something to me.
- No.
- Yes, you did.
- I didn't.
- You heard him, didn't you?!
- This is bullshit...
Bullshit? I want your name.
Give me your name! I want your name!
Er, a bourbon, thanks.
Erm, a double bourbon with ice, thanks.
You all right?
Yeah.
You sure? You don't look all right.
What are you, a cop?
Yeah.
- Really?
- Really.
Sorry, I just...
Something really weird happened.
This woman just started yelling at me.
She must've thought
I touched her or....
- What for?
- I don't know. She just went nuts.
- Well, did you?
- No! I don't do stuff like that.
OK, take it easy, I believe you.
Sorry. It's just...
it was just really weird and...
now you're a cop
so that's really, really weird. Sorry.
You want another drink?
- Yeah, thanks.
- Same again, mate.
Sharon said there's
a booze bust on the freeway.
- I'll take the back road home. Hannah?
- Dad?
Grab Dad's wallet from the kitchen!
Yes.
Hey. She asked me in
for coffee this morning.
Who?
- Jane.
- What for?
- I don't know.
- I can't find it!
Near the fridge! I don't know.
I think she was trying to come on to me.
- What?
- She's lonely, Nik.
And you're bored -that's a lethal
combination -stay away from her.
What's the matter?
You a little bit jealous, eh? Yeah?
You ever fuck with our marriage
and I'll cut your balls off.
I'll hang them on the line
between your socks and your jocks.
- You got it?
- Sure, babe.
Wake me up when you get home.
And I'm running down this hill
and I go around this corner
and suddenly
there's this guy and...bang!
Right into him. And I go after him,
yelling at him and...
"You fucking prick,
look where you're going."
- It was your fault.
- Yeah.
I don't know why I went at him,
a button got pushed or something.
Anyway, so I look down
and there he is on the ground cowering.
Oh...
Blood all over his face,
I've broken his fucking nose.
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.
He gets up and starts to walk away
and that's when it happens.
- What?
- He starts to cry.
- What for?
- I don't know.
- What makes a man cry like that?
- A lot of things.
So what did you do?
I just...I held him.
I just stood there and I held him.
But the whole time I was thinking,
"Fucking prick, pull yourself together."
- Don't you wanna cry sometimes?
- Well, yeah, but you don't, do you?
Hi.
We ordered you food but we ate it.
What's that smell?
- Where's your mum?
- Dancing.
- Where's your brother?
- Upstairs.
Shit.
Sam?
Sam? Sam!
Sam!
What the fuck is going on?
- For Christ's sake, I'm a cop!
- You can get the good stuff.
- Don't smart-mouth me.
- What's going on?
- Your brother's being an idiot.
- What's new?
Did you know about this?
Have you tried it?
- If you ever give your brother...
- As if...
- Shut up! Shut up!
- No...
If you ever give him this stuff I'll give you
a thumping you'll never forget!
Now, give me the rest of the stash.
- That's it.
- Get downstairs.
- You're grounded, mate.
- What?
Oh, shit.
Oh, God.

'If you'd like to leave a message
please do so after the tone.'
'Hi, it's me, are you there?
'OK, uh, I've had an accident.
I'm OK, I can't get the car started.'
I'm on the back road and, uh...
I just, uh, wanted to get home.
I'll try your mobile. Bye.
Road service
said there'd be a 90-minute wait.
'Where are you?
You didn't say you were gonna be late.
'I can't stand this!'
Please...
Please, I need you.
John?
There's a man...
Patrick.
He's a client and he's, um...
he's gay.
I don't understand this,
I don't understand...
us...
any more.
I don't want this to be happening to us.
Oh, there are lights.
There's a car coming. I'll wave it down.
Um... Wait for me,
we'll talk when I get home, OK?
Bye.
I love you.
- You need sleep.
- I wish. What've you got?
Locals get a call about 12:30 am
from the husband.
He gets home late, his wife's not there.
She's left messages
saying she's run off the road
from a phone box
about two K’s down the road.
Last call says a car's coming, she's
gonna wave it down. She never makes it.
- 50 bucks says it's the husband.
- You're on.
Mr Somers?
Knox. My wife's name is Somers.
I'm Detective Zat.
This is my colleague, Detective Weis.
We've located your wife's car, Mr Knox.
Do you mind if we come in?
Mr Knox, it appears that
your wife ran off the road.
There's a telephone box
several kilometers further along.
- Should I go there?
- We're conducting a search there
but if she had a lift from somebody
it's unlikely she'll still be there.
- Would you answer a few questions?
- I've been through this with the police.
I don't want to trouble you but could
you tell me what happened last night?
I got home around midnight,
her car wasn't here.
I checked the machine,
there were a couple of calls.
The last message said a car was coming
and she was gonna wave it down.
And that's when you called the police?
I waited about 20 minutes,
that's how long...
- So you called the police at 12:20?
- More or less.
Mr Knox, do you have a photo
of your wife that we could have, please?
Thank you.
- How was your wife yesterday?
- Fine.
- Nothing troubling her?
- No.
Mr Knox, I'm trying to find out about
your wife's emotional state.
Right now, I'd say her emotional state
was pretty bad.
- None of this is very pleasant.
- I can imagine.
What can you imagine? Are you married?
Yeah.
If your wife got into a car with a stranger,
some man, and didn't come home,
what would you imagine?
Right now I'd be going mad.
Yeah.
Mr Knox, we'll need the tape.
She... This is private.
In what sense?
She's upset.
She wasn't expecting anyone else
to be listening to it.
I'll make sure this is returned to you.
Come here.
Hey.
You didn't wake me up last night.
No, I got in a bit late.
What's with the face?
- I fell over.
- Were you pissed?
Yeah, a little.
Come on, kids.
Got your bag, Hannah?
- Look!
- Quickly, come on.
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.
Seat belts on, quickly.
Nik got in late last night.
Haven't you got anything better to do
than spy on your neighbours?
What?
Jane, just don't invite Nik in for coffee
when I'm not here.
All right?
Paula. Hey.
That's the appointment book. Her notes
and tapes are in the filing cabinet.
- Do you mind?
- No.
- How was she yesterday?
- All right.
Is she the kind of person
that would get into a car with a stranger?
No, not after what happened
to her daughter.
Sarah, I would like you to print me
a list of all her current clients,
- with addresses and phone numbers.
- Is that ethical?
Probably not.
'- It's not that he might have...
- slept with another woman.
'It's that he might not tell me.
'That would be the betrayal.'
'Do you still love him?'
'Good evening.
Richard Morecroft with ABC News.
'Police are inquiring into
the disappearance of a woman
'in bushland north of the city.
'Psychiatrist Valerie Somers
was last seen on Friday night.
'Her car was found abandoned
along the Lower Ridge Road.
'It's believed she may have accepted
a lift from a passing motorist.
'Ms Somers has recently completed
a book about the murder of her daughter.
'The body of 11-year-old Eleanor Knox
'was found dumped in a city laneway
18 months ago.
'Police are appealing to the public
'for information regarding
Ms Somers' disappearance.'
Why do you think
she turned off the freeway, John?
Some people say it's shorter.
Who's Patrick?
I don't know.
She mentioned she was having
some sort of trouble with a client.
- What kind of trouble?
- She didn't go into details of her clients.
- Why not?
- It's unprofessional.
- Even between a husband and a wife?
- Yes.
- I tell my wife everything.
- That surprises me.
- Why?
- Most men hold something back.
You're some kind of academic,
aren't you?
I'm dean of law. I studied at Harvard,
that's where Valerie and I met.
I just don't understand
why she'd get into a car with a stranger.
Well, maybe she didn't.
Maybe she knew him.
How's your marriage been lately, John?
- It's fine. Yours?
- Up and down.
- Where were you Friday night?
- Am I a suspect?
Where were you Friday night, John?
- I was at work.
- Can anybody verify that?
No, I was alone.
Nobody saw me.
Nine times out of ten,
when the wife goes missing,
the husband knows something about it.
You're a prick.
The young constable
will give you a ride home.
'- Anyway, we've, erm...
- been seeing each other for a while.'
'And you like him?'
'Yes, I do.
'Very much.'
'So?'
'He comes encumbered...
'with a wife.'
- Don't you have a home to go to?
- Yes. Do you?
Did you find anything?
She dedicates the book to John -
"for teaching me to trust again".
- Listen to a few of those tapes?
- Yeah.
- What do you think?
- She didn't like the man.
- Go home, we've got an early start.
- What about you?
- Soon.
- OK.
You really do look like shit. Go home.
Thank you.
Talk to the mystery man yet?
He never came back.
Oh. Silly bugger.
I'm not asleep.
Did you watch the news?
Yeah.
Will you find her?
Well, it's not looking good.
I saw her client list, Sonja.
Why didn't you tell me?
Because it was private.
It was just something I had to do.
There was a time when there was
no private between you and me.
That is because I had
somebody I could talk to and if...
I have to tell you something.
I had an affair.
I slept with her twice.
I know it hurts you, it...
hurts her.
Why?
Because I'm numb.
I can't feel anything any more, just...
just totally fucking numb.
Why'd you sleep on the couch?
I came in late last night,
didn't wanna wake your mum up.
Are you fighting?
Yeah, a bit.
Why?
It's something
we've got to sort out alone.
- You all right, Mum?
- Yeah.
I'll be in the car.
Can you grab something to eat, please?
We're running late.
Look, are we gonna talk about this?
Or are you just gonna punish me?
This is how you're gonna punish me?
I fucked up, all right? People fuck up.
Really? Well, I don't.
It's so easy, Leon,
so easy to go out and find somebody.
You know what's hard?
What's hard is not to.
Sonja, listen...
Get off me!
We'll talk about this tonight, all right?
Oh... Get fucked.
I don't even know if I'll be here later.
Hi.
Did you know?
You ready?
Hey. It's me.
Hey, can you come over?
- What number is it?
- 406.
You sure you're up to this?
Mr Phelan? We're investigating
the disappearance of Valerie Somers
and we're hoping that you can help us.
It's not a good time.
- I was out late.
- Who with?
Mr Phelan, the woman is missing.
- Do you know what's happened to her?
- Not yet.
You had an appointment with her?
Can you tell us how she was?
She seemed all right.
- I don't know.
- You don't know?
Well, she's the therapist.
I wasn't that focused on how she was.
How'd you get on with her?
- Fine.
- That's it? Fine?
We didn't end our last session
on very good terms.
- Oh, yeah? Why's that?
- We disagreed about something.
What was that? What?
That married guy you've been fucking?
- How do you know that?
- Recorded sessions.
- That's confidential.
- Under the circumstances...
That's my life!
Is there somebody in that room?
Is it your boyfriend?
- Ask him to come out.
- He has nothing to do with this.
- Ask him to come out!
- Leon!
You don't have the right to do this!
You don't have the fucking right!
Finished?
That went well. Your marriage is
falling apart and so are you.
It's none of your business.
Bullshit, it is my business
if you can't do your job.
If you don't like it,
take it up with the station.
Push.
- Hello?
- 'Hi, Dylan.'
Hi, Dad.
Could I speak to your mum?
No, she's still pissed off with you.
Yeah, all right. Erm...
Look, tell her...
tell her I'll be home soon.
All right. See ya, Dad.
What did he say?
He said to say that he's sorry,
that he loves you,
and he wants you to stop
being angry with him.
You look bereft, Leon.
The question is, why don't you?
Don't be deceived by appearances.
Want a whisky?
Somebody may have hurt your wife,
John. I need to know if it was you.
- I didn't hurt her.
- She was upset on the phone.
- She was afraid.
- Of what?
Being alone.
Of me not being there for her.
Why weren't you there for her?
When your wife was in some phone box,
calling for your help,
where were you?
Are you seeing someone else?
- Is it an affair? Is that it?
- No.
With a man? I believe that's what
Valerie thought was going on.
What are you talking about?
She believed you were having an affair
with Patrick Phelan.
Were you seeing men on the side?
- I don't have to listen to this.
- You do.
My wife's missing.
What are you doing about it?
Trying to find her. But I need to know
what's going on inside her head.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Have you ever cheated on your wife?
No.
- Never desired another woman?
- Of course.
- But you never acted on it.
- No.
Well, you're a better man than I am.
- So there is someone else.
- No.
There was someone, once.
A woman.
Once that's happened
you're never entirely believed again.
Something gets broken, permanently-
trust, I suppose.
When that happens,
anything's possible, it would seem.
You don't lose a daughter,
like we lost Eleanor,
without some damage.
So where were you?
I left work late.
I stopped at the place
where my daughter was killed.
I go there. A lot.
Valerie didn't know that.
You didn't tell her?
Why not, John?
What holds your marriage
together, Leon?
Er...
Loyalty.
Love.
Maybe habit,
sometimes passion, our kids...
Ours was held together by grief.
There wasn't much else left.
Are you saying
you didn't love her any more?
I'm saying that
sometimes love isn't enough.
Leon, where the hell have you been?
A man called. His wife saw her neighbour
throw a shoe into a vacant lot
on the night Valerie disappeared.
She's got the shoe, black leather.
Where are we going?
- This could be tricky.
- Why?
- I know the woman.
- Oh, Jesus.
Detective Claudia Weis.
Leon! We had a drink the other night.
Yeah, how are you?
Good. You'd better come in,
my wife's pretty upset.
Jane, it's the police.
Erm, this is Leon and...
- Claudia.
- And Claudia. Jane.
- Is that the shoe?
- Yeah.
You shouldn't have
touched the shoe, Mrs...
O'May. It's Jane O'May.
Right, Mrs O'May.
You shouldn't have touched it.
Well, I did.
Yeah, but you shouldn't have.
Well, I did, didn't I? It's on the table.
- You think we could have some coffee?
- Yeah, er...it's out the back here.
I'll give you a hand.
You all right?
- You got a light?
- Yeah, yeah.
How do you wanna handle this?
You're a policeman, aren't you?
Why don't you just do your job?
I've never seen you before.
Can I speak to Paula, please?
It's urgent. Can you tell her
to call home as soon as she can?
Yeah, as soon as she can, please.
Leave it. Get your brother.
Nik D'Amato, Detective Claudia Weis.
My kids, I gotta get someone
to watch my kids.
Yeah, righto, mate.
I'll give you a couple of minutes.
So I go to the window
at about 11:30.
I go to the window
and he's chucking that.
He threw it over there
and he was looking like he's really guilty.
Nik?
You're back, Pete.
Well, sort of.
- How are you?
- Good. You?
I'm in a bit of trouble.
Listen, can you take the kids?
Just till Paula gets back.
I wouldn't ask
unless I really needed the help.
Yeah, all right. We'll take 'em.
Gee, thanks.
There you go.
Thanks.
There's, erm...
There's pyjamas, a toothbrush.
There's a video
and some other stuff in there as well.
Thanks very much, OK?
Time to go.
- No, Daddy, don't go, don't go.
- Come on. I'll be back soon.
- No!
- Come on, you stay with Jane.
How did you get the scratches
on your face, Nik?
- I wanna see my wife.
- She's on her way.
Can you tell us
where you were Friday night?
I wanna see Paula.
You are in deep shit, mate.
Your wife can't help you.
- Hey, I know you.
- I doubt it.
- Yeah, I've seen you before.
- Shut up. Shut up!
- You were next door at Jane's place.
- I told you to shut up!
Where are my kids?
Where are my bloody kids?
- With your neighbour.
- Who are you?
- Calm down.
- I don't want to be calm, all right?
- Can I get you something?
- Yes, my husband!
- OK.
- And get me out of here!
Just step back in here.
I've been waiting here for an hour!
Mrs D'Amato, I'm Detective Sergeant Zat.
I believe you've already met
Detective Constable Weis.
I wanna see Nik.
Your husband is helping us
with our inquiries.
Bullshit.
He was seen throwing a shoe
into a vacant lot.
Who saw him?
A search was conducted in the block
opposite your house.
Mmm, I know the one.
My kids play there,
every kid on the street plays there.
They found a shoe.
It was identified as belonging to
Mrs Valerie Somers.
She's been missing
since last Friday night.
Paula!
- 'Hello?'
- Janey, Paula.
Oh, hi.
- 'Hannah awake?'
- Hey, the kids are fine, you know?
Maybe I could just talk to Hannah.
No, she's, erm...she's asleep.
- 'The baby?'
- You know what? They're all asleep.
Sorry about this, Janey.
Nik's in trouble.
They won't let me see him,
I don't know what to do.
You know what? It's...
It's OK, everything's OK.
'The kids are, like, really safe.'
I'm sorry.
I'll get there as soon as I can, OK?
- OK.
- 'Thank you.'
Bye, Janey.
- Does she know you rang the police?
- No.
They say you've, erm...
hurt some woman, Nik.
I didn't, babe.
I didn't touch her.
Don't. Not yet. Don't.
- What is it, Hannah?
- The baby's sick.
What is it, hey?
What is it?
God, he's burning up.
Get us a flannel, Pete. Do a wet one.
- Panadol.
- What?
He needs Panadol.
Panadol!
Poor little thing.
- This all right for babies?
- I dunno. Get half out.
- Maybe baby Panadol.
- What?
- Baby Panadol.
- You'll have to go to a chemist.
There's some in our house.
I'd met some mates for a drink.
We used to work together,
it's just something we keep up.
We drank more than we should've
so I took the back road home.
The police don't patrol it.
Must've been about...quarter to 12.
'I see this woman
standing at the side of the road.
'I don't wanna stop. It's late and I'm
thinking Paula will be getting worried.
'But what do I do?
That woman needs help. So I pull over.'
My car ran off the road.
Get in.
Thanks.
What's your name?
- Valerie.
- I'm Nik.
'It turns out she lives in one of those
houses by the bay.
'There's a strip of houses along the quay.
'It's out of my way,
in the opposite direction almost.
'She doesn't say much. I can tell she
doesn't wanna talk so I just leave it.'
But I know this short cut
and I just don't...I just don't think.
Before I can say,
"This is the short way," she's gone.
What do you mean, she's gone?
Hey!
Wait!
I'm not gonna hurt you!
Trust me!
You know...
I thought that...
if I leave her alone...
she'll stop being afraid of me.
So I just...
I just left her there.
When I got home I saw, er...
I saw her shoe on, erm...
the floor of my car.
And I, erm...
Jesus, you know,
I just wanted to help the woman.
Why didn't you report it, Nik?
Because I thought she'd be all right,
you know?
I thought she'd find her way out of there.
Then when I, erm...
Then when I saw on the news that...
Then when I saw on the news
that she was missing, I...
By then, you know, who was...
who was gonna believe me?
Thank you...
for letting me know.
Bye.
Paula. Come in.
Hi.
Hello, sweetheart.
You go home, all right?
Daddy'll be home soon.
Maybe they could come back later.
They've been so good, Paula.
No, I don't think so.
Good boy.
Paula?
He didn't do it, Jane.
How do you know?
He told me.
Paula?
What could I do, Paula?
All right.
Go inside and put your bags
in your rooms.
Stupid...
You've got no right, Jane!
You hear me?!
No fucking right!
I don't wanna see you
anywhere near my kids again.
I was home, Leon.
I didn't pick up the phone.
'John, there's a man...Patrick.
'He's a client and he's, um...he's gay.
'I don't understand this.
'I don't understand...
'us any more.
'I don't want this to be happening to us.
'Oh. There are lights.
'There's a car coming, I'll wave it down.
'Erm...
'Wait for me.
We'll talk when I get home, OK?
'Bye.
'I love you.'
I thought she would come home.
'- It's not...
- It's not that he might have...
'slept with another woman.
'It's...
'that he might not tell me.
'That would be the betrayal.'
'Do you still love him?'
'Yeah, I...I still love him.'
I don't wanna lose you.
What?
I don't wanna lose you, I couldn't bear it.
