No.
Shh.
Hello, Mr. Davis.
My name is Jack Carter, and
you don't want to know me.
Ugh!
I know it's one just guy talking,
but I'll be honest with you.
I don't understand what the
big freaking deal is. I don't.
Listen asshole, I told Fletcher
I was gonna get him the money.
- You shut up!
- Ugh!
Give me a break, Jack.
You haven't seen the guy in,
what, four, five years?
He kicks and now suddenly
you give a shit?
You Father Mulcahy?
I'm so not buying this, it's not
even funny, kemo sabe.
My little brother is dead.
He left a family,
so I'm going. I owe him.
Let me get this. Now you owe him?
Here's the bad news:
It's a little late.
Listen, the therapy session is
good, you know? You need it...
but why don't I go somewhere
else? I'm gonna talk to...
You sit here and you
shut your mouth...
or this is going to the
next level, you got that?
"Next level"? What is that?
A catch phrase or something?
Catch phrase?
Jack, come on.
Take it easy or you'll give
yourself a fucking heart attack.
Fletcher wants your ass here.
He's made that very clear to you.
I'm like a broken record.
If you don't take
care of business...
the business will take care of you.
- I'm taking care of business.
- Whatever.
- What time is your flight?
- I'm not flying.
- I beg your pardon?
- Not flying, Connie.
Uh-huh. You got something
special working there?
What? Knives, guns, flamethrowers?
Something you're not telling
Con-a-won-a-doo-da-day?
I'm back in a couple of days.
Right. But, Jack?
What are you doing here?
I came to pay my respects.
He could've used your
respect while he was alive.
Is Doreen around?
Yeah, she's around.
I will lift up mine eyes unto the
hills, from whence cometh my help.
My help cometh from the Lord,
which made Heaven and Earth.
He will not suffer thy
foot to be moved:
He that keepeth thee
will not slumber.
Behold, He that keepeth Israel
shall neither slumber nor sleep.
The Lord is thy keeper.
The Lord is thy shade
upon thy right hand.
The sun shall not smite thee
by day, nor the moon by night.
The Lord shall preserve
thee from all evil.
He shall preserve thy going out...
and thy coming in from
this day forth...
and even for evermore. Amen.
How you doing? I'm Jack,
Richie's brother.
Oh, shit, man. Hi, I'm Eddie.
I worked with him
over at the George.
Eddie, let me ask you a question:
- Was my brother into something?
- Richie? No, man.
He wasn't that type of guy.
I'm very sorry about your father.
Don't feel sorry for me.
You don't know me.
You're a picture on a piano.
Hey.
Hold up, would you?
I couldn't help noticing you.
You stand out in a crowd.
I'm Jack, Richie's brother.
Oh.
- I'm real sorry. He was a great guy.
- Yeah.
So, uh, where'd you
know Richard from?
Around the bar.
You know how it goes.
No.
Why don't you tell me?
I don't know you well
enough to get personal.
You think something happened...
between the time you saw
him and the accident?
I don't know. Maybe, I guess.
But you'd know if something was up.
Shit, man, I don't know.
I guess. Yeah, maybe.
Jack, that is enough!
It's enough.
What are you gonna do, rough me up?
I like to be alone.
Sure.
I'm fine, all right?
I just came out for a smoke.
You know, Doreen, you don't know me
very well, and what you do know...
you don't like much.
I'm gonna be here over the weekend,
so if you need anything at all...
I'll be staying at the
Mercer Hotel, okay?
- He didn't drink.
- What?
My dad.
He wouldn't drink and drive.
So, what do you think happened?
I don't know.
Maybe...
I don't know. Forget it.
He's dead, right? What's it matter?
Tell my mom I'll be home later.
<i>What'd I tell you? What'd I say?</i>
<i>Which part of "I can't let you go"
did you not under-fucking-stand?</i>
<i>This is your job.</i>
This is not a freaking charity
case. You do your job!
I want your butt
down here tomorrow.
I am the boss, Jack! Okay?
<i>Got me?</i>
<i>I can't believe you
guys kept this cat.</i>
Richie and I used to hide stuff from
our mom underneath all the cookies.
I'm pretty sure she knew, but
I don't think she really cared. Heh.
So were you two guys okay?
- What?
- I mean you and Richie...
I mean, before the accident,
were you two getting along okay?
- What kind of question is that?
- It's just a question.
Was he drinking a lot more?
More than normal?
What? Jack...
Eddie said he didn't
see him drink much.
Doreen said he wouldn't
drink and drive. I'm just...
Oh, Jack. What are you doing?
- What?
- Why do you care all of a sudden?
Because he's dead?
Where were you before?
He was your brother. You disappeared
on him, and now he's gone.
So, what am I supposed to do?
Take a trip down
memory lane with you?
Catch you up on how he's doing?
What do you think you're gonna
do, come and fix things?
You don't fix things.
You break things.
Remember?
- <i>Hello, it's Connie.</i>
- It's me.
<i>Jack! What do you say?</i>
Fucking white of you to call.
Fletcher ripped me a new asshole.
- You on your way back?
- I'm staying a while.
Come on, look.
Who do you think is taking
the heat? We're partners.
You're screwed, I'm screwed.
He wants you.
- You need a written invitation?
- I got some things to do.
Okay, here's the
truth as I know it.
I don't know how much longer
I can cover your ass.
- We gonna see Fletcher?
- Absolutely.
<i>We are there.</i>
You got something to say?
What do you want to say?
It's time to chop it
up with the big dog.
<i>Because I'm hearing talk,
Jack. People are talking.</i>
About you and Audrey. I don't
know if I can keep it from him.
They must be hearing it from you.
- <i>Am I right?</i>
- You simple bitch!
I'm covering your ass.
Do you hear me?
- I'm covering your ass!
- <i>Better cover your own ass.</i>
Which way is Brumby's office?
Listen, I don't want to
hear you can't find it.
This was supposed to be done.
A guy died the other night.
Can you hold on a second?
Can I help you?
I'm Jack Carter. Richie's brother.
I'll call you right back.
Christ. I'm, uh, sorry
I wasn't at the funeral.
Never could take them.
Would you like some, uh,
coffee or something?
No, I'm fine, thanks.
He was a good bloke, Richie was.
Saved my ass a lot of money
just by doing a solid job.
How long was he running
this place for you?
Since we've been up.
About five years.
- Five years and no problems?
- None.
No enemies?
Well, not that I know of. I mean,
he was an easygoing sort of bloke.
Does he seem like a
guy to get drunk...
and go out driving in a rainstorm?
- Not to me.
- Me neither.
Where is this going?
I think he was taken out.
Taken out?
Richie?
Why would you say that?
There's something
you're not telling me.
- What the hell does that mean?
- Relax.
I don't like hard cases coming in
and talking like I know something.
If someone's putting out something
about me, I want to know who.
And when I know what and who...
I might just take the matter
up with you, Jack. Mightn't I?
You're a big man,
but you're out of shape.
With me, it's a full-time job.
So please, sit down.
Thank you.
I know you got security
cameras around the bar.
Did the police ask to
look at the tapes?
Why would they?
It was drunk driving.
Mind if I do?
That's got the, uh, whole night on it.
Did you talk to Geraldine?
Who's Geraldine?
Oh, Christ. How am
I gonna put this?
She was his, uh, lady on
the side, his <i>innamorata.</i>
You know this for sure?
What can I tell you?
It wasn't a big thing.
Not many people knew about it.
Cyrus.
How you doing?
Holy shit.
Well, if it ain't the Vegas
man with the Vegas tan.
Geraldine, right?
Been a long time.
Yeah, Jack, it's been
a very long time.
I heard about Richie, man.
That's pretty messed up.
Yeah.
You got my deepest condolences
and all that shit.
I appreciate that.
You still running with Fletcher?
Why not? How are you
making a living?
- Well, I'm making.
- With who?
- With somebody. What do you care?
- I don't care.
I want to know if you're
still a bottom-feeder.
Let me tell you something.
You see all this shit here?
You see it?
This is the new world, brother.
I'm on-line. My girls. My business.
While you're running around chasing
deadbeats for some fucking asshole...
I'm swimming in the big pool, baby.
I got the juice around here now.
I hooked up with this freak
and this foreign guy.
Created my own little empire.
Look at you.
The little man versus the start-up.
You got a problem with me?
Let me tell you something, Jack.
I think you should take
a very big moment...
and just think about where you are.
Because this ain't
yesterday, slick.
Relax, I'm just playing with you.
Oh, yeah, I get that.
Don't put your hands on me.
Come on, let me see your eyes.
Come on.
Whatever turns you on, Jack.
Still pretty? Hmm?
Yeah.
Like cat piss in the snow.
See you around.
Hey, you can't come...
Hey, you can't come in here.
Hey, mate, where are you going?
Is this the part where I'm
supposed to be scared?
You Carter?
That's right.
And you really don't
want to know me.
Shit, it's good to be home.
Cyrus, I never met him.
Get off. I don't know him.
Shut up and get in the car.
- Good afternoon. Are you a member?
- I'm here with Mr. Franklin.
Go right ahead.
Hey, pal, you're
walking on my line.
Just smile, sweetheart, and
get rid of the guy, okay?
Nice stroke.
Who the fuck are you?
Tiger Woods.
I'm gonna go and get
security, all right?
- Can I help you, sir?
- I don't know.
Ahem. Are you from the club?
Is there a problem?
My brother died the other
night, and now I'm here.
- Listen, uh, Mister...
- Carter.
Carter. Mr. Carter. Um...
I'm real sorry about your
brother. That, uh, sucks.
But I can't help you here.
I suggest you contact my outreach
program at the offices...
Mind if we talk a minute?
Uh, yes, I mind.
I was under the impression
this was a private club.
We should go someplace and talk.
- Listen, scary man...
- I scare you?
Okay.
Whatever this is, it isn't
going over real well.
Drive me to my car. We'll talk
on the way. Is that a problem?
- Yeah, it is a problem.
- No, no. It's a problem if you don't.
Come on. It's okay. Come on.
- So, what's your name?
- Jeremy Kinnear.
Maybe you've read
about me in Forbes.
I don't do that, Jeremy. What are
you saying? You're bucks-up?
Without blowing my horn...
my computer company is
worth a gazillion dollars.
- Give or take.
- Your folks must be very proud.
I paid off my loans, bought
them a house in France.
They leave me alone.
I think we've got a
mutual acquaintance.
- Really?
- Yeah. Cyrus Paice.
Yeah, I know him.
I try not to spend too
much time around him.
What's the connection?
Mr. Carter, I really don't
have to answer your questions.
Sure you do, Jeremy.
What's the connection?
Okay, Mr. Carter, fine.
You know, um...
when you spend most of your
life behind a computer...
things like golf and girls become
pretty important, you know?
They don't go well
with the glasses...
and pocket-protector image
my stockholders prefer.
- So...
- So he pulls for you.
You know why I like
golf, Mr. Carter?
Because the ball just
keeps going away.
Only sport where you hit the
sucker and it doesn't come back.
I've got to want to go after it.
And when I get to it...
I just knock it away again.
See what I'm saying, Mr. Carter?
Once I get rid of it...
I never want to see it again.
He said his brother
died and now he's here.
He's here! You get me?
We are fucked!
Excuse me, Mr. Kinnear.
- Can you get your feet off the table?
- Yes, sorry. Sure.
No, you listen to me.
You asked me to get you on-line.
I did. Fair trade.
You start this porn. I said,
"Keep me clean," but you can't.
I can't think what happens if
he's taken it to the police.
How'd he get it, anyway? It's
supposed to go to the hard drive.
Damn right I'm freaking out! I'm a
Harvard grad. I do not do porn.
No, shush!
I don't want to know what happened.
I don't care.
It's none of my business.
I just want the big brother gone.
Not "gone" like the other guy.
I mean away. I want him
away, I want you away.
I want the whole thing done.
Hello.
- Where's the big bad wolf?
- Out with the pigs, I guess.
He wants you back...
Look, Audrey. I was thinking that, uh,
when I get back, you and me...
we gotta get out of Vegas for good.
Jack...
I can't do this.
Do what?
<i>You and me.</i>
Les Fletcher is my job.
It's what I do.
You...
you're...
you're something different.
All right, fine. You ought to get
out of there, with or without me...
- <i>but you ought to get out.</i>
- Hey, Audrey!
I'm up here!
- Get down here.
- I gotta go.
Yeah, it's good.
Another time, another place, huh?
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>Bye.</i>
<i>Sometimes I feel I'm gonna be
alone for the rest of my life.</i>
<i>I wake up and look
at my little girl...</i>
and I wonder when it was
we became strangers.
She's all I have now, Jack,
and I want her back so bad...
and I don't even
know where she went.
She won't talk to me.
She won't even yell at me.
Oh, my God.
- Who are you?
- What?
I mean, I'm just trying
to make sense of this...
of you.
You disappear for five years...
then you come back.
Come back...
I don't know, you look like Frank
Sinatra or something and...
I just can't figure you out.
You know, it's not that
big a deal, Gloria.
Everything changes, they say.
Why not me?
I just want to try to do
something right. Once.
Yeah, well, what is that, though?
What's right, Jack? You're too
late to be Richie's brother.
You can't be Doreen's dad.
And you can't be my man.
So I just don't know where you fit.
Maybe I don't.
Maybe I don't.
I'm sorry.
Eddie!
- You know Geraldine?
- What?
Geraldine. Do you
know where she lives?
I don't know, man.
The girl that hung around Richie,
do you know where she lives?
- A girl? What?
- Come on.
So you know Doreen much?
Uh...
Yeah, a little.
It's right up here on the left.
So, uh, you done with me, man?
No. Sit tight, I'll be right back.
Relax, everything is okay.
How you doing?
Do you know where Geraldine is?
What was Richie to you?
- You can't just break into my house.
- What was he to you?
I told you.
I met him at the bar.
He was just a guy I met.
That's all.
That's all?
- He was nicer than most.
- Did you know he was married?
- Look...
- Did you know that?
What do you want?
I talked to him. It's not a crime.
I gotta be somewhere.
I want to know what happened.
You don't want to know.
Geraldine.
Look at me.
Look at me.
I didn't come up here to hurt you.
I just want to know what happened.
Richie wanted me to leave with him.
He and his wife weren't
getting along so well.
Hardly spoke, you know?
They were gonna get divorced.
He wanted me to run away,
someplace like New York.
I said I couldn't
do that, you know?
I got my own life here.
Yeah.
I went to the bar to say
goodbye, and he followed me out.
And he makes this big
scene outside the bar.
I hear he got pretty drunk.
Look, I don't want to
talk about this anymore.
The keys are in it.
Carter.
Looks like the rain must
have backed up the sewer.
How you been, man?
- Still hanging around, Thorpey?
- I like it here.
I gotta have a word with you.
Confidential.
You just stay in the car.
What do you want to tell me?
- How you been? I mean, you look good.
- Thank you.
I'm losing sleep here.
What do you want?
Here, take this. It's free.
- Alaska Airlines, first class.
- That's nice.
Who do I have to thank?
I've been asked to make sure you
get on that plane. Tonight.
Whatever they're paying
you, it ain't enough.
What you want to do, cowboy?
Take your best shot. Come on!
Come on, shoot him.
You got the stuff?
You got the balls?
Let's see you do it.
Put the gun down.
Put it down. Put it down.
Big man.
Whoa.
Come on. Come on!
Come on.
Get back!
Out of the way!
Shit!
Oh, shit!
Shit!
Okay. Okay.
Fuck!
Ride's over.
I delivered the ticket
because you knew my brother.
- I knew you wouldn't do it!
- Who sent you?
- I can't say.
- Were you involved with my brother?
I had nothing to do with Richie.
Then give me a name,
or you're history.
Brumby's in the back.
- Carter?
- So now you're a travel agent.
- What?
- Very nice touch, sending Thorpey.
Very nostalgic.
- What are you talking about?
- What'd Richie have on you?
Bloody hell! Richie was my friend.
Does it take a fucking miracle
for you to believe that?
You're not giving me anything.
Okay, Jack, Jack, Jack.
Stop that. Stop it,
for fuck's sake.
Look, okay.
I owed this bloke some money.
He fronted a truckload last
year to extend the club.
He calls me this afternoon,
says he'll wipe the slate clean...
if I'll do this, uh, thing for him.
He said he wanted you out of town.
That's all. He didn't say
how, just out of town.
Your brother was my friend,
Jack. I wouldn't hurt him.
Yeah.
Give me a name or this is
going to another level.
Cyrus Paice.
You want me out? You want me out?
You want to do this?
You want to do this?
Rabbit's out of the hat.
Will it jump?
- What did you do to Richie?
- Goddamn you! I did nothing.
I hate to be the bearer of bad
news, but you're chasing your ass.
You were gone too long,
brother. Shit changes.
Maybe not you, but
some shit does change.
Your precious brother, Richie,
was no goddamn saint.
Everybody's into something,
Jack. Plain and simple.
There's no mystery, no intrigue.
He got juiced up one night.
He got oiled up...
and he wrapped his sorry
ass around a tree.
End of story.
Now if you want to do this little
dance here for old time's sake...
bring it.
Let me tell you, you'll end
up like a one-legged man...
in an ass-kicking contest.
I'm tired of your bullshit,
Jack. I'm a businessman.
I got ladies waiting
for me on the inside.
Grow up, Jack.
Uncle Jack.
I didn't think you
were gonna show up.
I was in the
neighborhood, you know?
Listen, Doreen, I'm out
having one of those...
year-long nights.
I'm not fun to be around.
Maybe we should take
a rain check on this.
Okay?
Okay.
- Bye.
- I'll give you a call tomorrow.
Doreen.
You hungry?
A little.
You drink coffee?
Yeah.
I smoke too.
I don't think that's
worth bragging about.
You smoke.
Well, I did. But I
just recently quit.
Oh, yeah? When?
Oh, I'd say about...
now.
So if you don't mind...
Makes you nuts, doesn't it?
It's having an impact, yes.
You are so freaky.
Well, we're all a
little freaky, Doreen.
It's the straight ones
we gotta worry about.
So.
What do you do, like, for work?
- What did your dad say?
- He didn't.
That's good.
Mom said you were a gambler.
Isn't that illegal?
Are you a bookie?
Bookie? No. More like...
a financial adjuster.
So.
You ever been to prison?
- How long?
- How about this weather?
Come on.
What do you say we
change the subject?
All right. Fine.
- You ever shoot anybody?
- Heh.
You want to know what
I do for a living?
Simple. People make promises
and they break them.
My job is to refresh their memory.
That's about it. No big deal.
What's with the clothes?
- What's with the jewelry in your face?
- You don't like it.
It's nice.
You ever been married?
I don't think so.
You don't have your own family.
What are you?
<i>Why'd you leave?</i>
<i>Well, Doreen, that's
a long, long story.</i>
<i>It's a long, long ride.</i>
Let's put it this way:
You ever want to take every
mirror and get rid of it...
because you didn't like
what it reflected?
Yeah.
I wish my dad was here.
Me too.
Do you, um...?
Do you really think
somebody killed him?
Yeah, I think so, but...
Me too.
- Do you have a license yet?
- Yep.
What, did you learn that in school?
- Dad taught me.
- Oh, yeah?
Would you wait in the car?
- Why?
- It's all right.
Please wait in the car.
I'll be right back. It's okay.
<i>If you need help, hang up
and then dial the operator.</i>
Jack!
- You okay?
- You seen Doreen?
- What happened?
- Where is she?
- Who did it?
- He came... I don't know. He came in.
Are you okay?
It's gonna be all right.
Really.
- Why did they do this?
- I don't know.
But I want to find out,
you can believe that.
- Let's go get your mom.
- Where are we going?
I want you guys to stay
with me tonight, okay?
Gloria, why don't
we get out of here?
I'm fine. I'm okay.
I need to talk to your
Uncle Jack alone.
What's wrong?
- I need you to leave, Jack.
- What?
My mom's coming over. We'll go
to her place and stay there.
Listen, I know that
you want to help.
Just look around.
Look what you brought into
my house. Look at my face.
Look at my family.
You're not helping, Jack.
So please go.
What did you say? I brought in?
I didn't bring anything here.
Tell me, what the
hell was Richie into?
Oh, God!
Okay.
- My head hurts.
- That's all right.
Whatever this costs,
I'll just take care of it.
You guys should get out of town.
Take a vacation. I'll
take care of that too.
We're fine. We're fine.
Just go.
I'm sorry, Gloria.
Hey.
I snuck out.
Took a cab.
Grandma's house smells funny.
Do you want to come in?
Nice tattoos.
I'll bring her by in the
morning. Yeah, I promise.
All right.
Good night.
Your mother is a little upset.
It was your idea to call her.
Listen, I don't mind.
She cares about you, she loves you.
That's pretty special.
You got one mother, right?
It's a real scary place out
there, so I don't blame her.
You must be a little tired.
Why don't you take the bed?
I got a lot of work to
do in the other room.
I'll take you home in
the morning, okay?
It's gonna be all right, really.
I was coming for you.
Bet you didn't know you had
a fairy godmother, Jack.
- What was on the disc you gave Richie?
- A fairy godmother all of your own.
Don't play me, Geraldine.
No more games.
No more dress up, understand?
You gave my brother a disc.
What was on it?
- I don't know what you're...
- No.
I tell you, if you lie to me,
I'm gonna break every...
Listen to me.
I'm gonna break every
beautiful bone in your body.
I'm not lying to you.
I'm just here because
he wanted to see you.
Who?
The Demon King.
He wanted to see you,
so he made some calls...
and he waved his
magic wand and poof!
Shit!
Sorry.
Hell of a day you had,
huh, Mr. Carter?
Sorry to get you up so early.
Personally, I hate mornings.
Where are you going?
She's done her job. She
doesn't need to hear this.
Oh.
Don't worry about Jimmy.
He's more here for decoration.
You want a cappuccino?
He makes a really mean froth.
I use nonfat milk.
Thanks, but I'm lactose intolerant.
What?
Um...
Jimmy, could you show our
friend down to her car?
Thanks.
- Cute guy.
- You think?
No.
I had my 30th birthday last month.
I'm worth about $900 million.
I'm in <i>Newsweek</i> and
<i>Forbes</i> in the same month.
I'm the all-powerful ruler of
time and space, Mr. Carter.
And your friend Cyrus...
the porn guy...
he's coming to me with
threats of going public.
Messing up my image.
Okay, awkward moment.
Look, I've never really done
this before, but, um...
I figure you probably have, so...
here goes.
I heard there was quite a fuss
the other night at the George.
Where's the disc?
Everybody's shitting
bricks, especially Cyrus.
Your brother Richard's
name was mentioned.
Cyrus goes out with
some very bad guys...
<i>and when he comes back...</i>
your brother's gone.
You see what I'm
saying, Mr. Carter?
I think we both want
the same thing.
Who do you think
you're fucking with?
Come on, come on.
- Yeah?
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- What do you want?
- What do I fucking want?
Talk.
I said, talk!
- Jack.
- <i>Tell him.</i>
<i>Tell him!</i>
Con says you're doing
her behind my back.
Tell me Con's lying. Tell me that!
- He is lying!
- Is your name Jack?
I love her, and I want to kill her.
I don't like you, so who
knows what I'd do to you!
You're a real tough
guy on the phone.
Audrey, get out. Go on,
he won't touch you.
Oh, I won't touch her, huh?
- Jack, please, listen...
- If you don't fucking shut up...
<i>I'm telling you, I'm two seconds away
from fucking pasting this broad.</i>
<i>Get back in town, or you're
both gonna be so fucking...</i>
You lay a hand on her, and I swear
I'll come back and bury you alive.
<i>When I finish with you, you'll
fucking wish I killed you.</i>
What do you want to do? I'm here.
Are you pathetic?
Go ahead, tell him, Audrey.
What do you want to do?
Audrey, what do you want to do?
- <i>You listening, lover-boy?</i>
- Yeah.
<i>You getting it?</i>
Les, I'm out of Vegas,
understand? It ends here.
<i>Fuck you. It ends when
I say so, you cocksucker.</i>
<i>Come on, baby, get in there.</i>
<i>Get that fine booty
in there. What's up?</i>
<i>You got some...</i>
<i>Showtime.</i>
<i>We're taking you to a party.</i>
<i>Come on, it'll be fun.</i>
<i>Yeah, baby, that's it.</i>
<i>No.</i>
<i>I need to leave. I need to leave.</i>
<i>It's cool.</i>
<i>No.</i>
What do you say?
You pick me a winner today?
You come up with a sure thing?
It's a bad time, Con.
Boy, you're telling me.
You remember Peter, don't you?
Jack! Jack!
No!
No, Jack!
Say, Jack.
When I said you take care of business
or business will take care of you...
did we have a bad connection?
Maybe you weren't listening?
Fuck it. It don't matter, does it?
I was real sorry to hear
about you and Audrey.
He's the big dog. There's
no way around that.
He gets the girl.
You get what you get.
Jack!
Doreen?
Hey.
Hey.
I saw that.
Caught.
What happened to your face?
A couple of guys jumped
me on the elevator.
Really?
No, I...
No, I slipped, you know?
It happens sometimes when
you get older, you know?
Your ticket for your Mustang.
I got it downstairs.
You probably should
be getting back now.
What are you gonna do?
Well, I'm gonna be
taking off today.
Why?
It just worked out that way.
For good?
For a while.
Doreen, before I go, I just...
want to tell you I think you're
a special girl. I mean that.
In just 48 hours...
I could see that.
Just, things happen to us,
Doreen, you know?
We make mistakes.
We fall down and...
we get into trouble. It happens
to everybody. It does.
But it doesn't mean...
everything that happened yesterday
has to happen every day. It doesn't.
You don't want to do it like me and
spend your whole life looking back.
You know, it is what it is.
We can't change our history.
We can't do that, I mean...
But you can go past it.
Just...
right past it.
And, you know, up ahead...
it's all new.
It's new. It's yours
if you want it.
I tell you, your mother loves you.
No matter what you think,
she loves you.
Maybe you got things you have
to talk to her about or some...
problems, whatever.
You should talk to her.
She'll listen.
I don't know what happened.
He, uh...
He worked with dad.
He was always really nice.
I thought I, um...
I thought I...
I mean...
I thought it was gonna be cool.
Fun, you know?
We, uh...
We had some...
We had some champagne
and, uh, he asked if I...
wanted to go to this party.
You should have seen
my friends' faces.
I don't even remember
what happened.
I just remember...
not being able to move much.
I remember, um...
wanting to leave.
Wanting it to stop.
Wanting to...
go home.
- It's all my fault.
- No.
It's not your fault.
None of this is your fault.
You gotta believe that.
No, no, no, no.
None of this is
your fault None of it.
- Yeah.
- <i>Jack?</i>
- Who is this?
- <i>It's Geraldine.</i>
<i>I didn't know she was
Richie's daughter.</i>
<i>When I found out who she was,
I got the disc to Richie right away.</i>
<i>I didn't know what he'd do with it.</i>
<i>He told them he was taking
the disc to the cops.</i>
<i>Cyrus knows I gave him the disc.</i>
<i>He's on his way here.
He's coming over now, Jack!</i>
<i>I didn't know who
to call. I was just...</i>
<i>Shit! I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>
- Where's Eddie?
- He's not working today.
- Where's he live?
- What's going on?
- Where does he live?
- Jack.
Will you listen to me?
For just a minute.
I've been in it all my life,
on both sides of the ocean.
If you get mixed up in whatever
your brother was into...
you got a good chance of winding
up exactly the same as he did.
And those two ladies will go
into mourning all over again.
Now, I can't tell you what
to do, but I can tell you this:
Getting yourself killed
won't bring Richie back.
Revenge doesn't work.
Sure it does.
- They knew what they were getting...
- Don't play me!
That was Cyrus' deal, man!
He probably killed
your brother, right?
It wasn't fucking me!
He's at a party right now...
at some fucking club
with Kinnear, all right?
I was just fucking playing around!
Go get them.
I'm having a hard time
understanding something.
What could she have done to you...
that was so bad that you'd
do this to her? Hmm?
Because what you did
doesn't go away!
She trusted you, and you raped her.
She was my brother's
daughter. My family.
And it's my fault.
Because if I had been here,
this never would have gone down.
So now I gotta make
it right. I gotta do that.
I mean, what would you do
if it was your daughter?
Jack, don't kill me, man.
You killed yourself.
Jack, stop!
Hey! Hey!
Get him! Go, go, go!
Jack!
Jack, stop!
Goddamn it!
Motherfucker!
Oh, fuck!
Don't lose him.
Straight on.
You're dead!
Just get on him.
You cocksucker!
Come on, come on, come on!
Drive, drive, go!
Where is he?
Man, Jack!
Here you go!
Don't turn!
Is this what you want?
Oh, shit!
Sorry, Mr. Carter.
You're not on the list.
Nobody likes the list guy.
Hey.
Can I help you with something?
I don't think so.
Jeremy Kinnear.
Look, Mr. Phone Guy, do you
have any idea who I am?
I'll buy your goddamn
hotel so I can fire you!
I want to talk to Mr. Fletcher.
Les Fletcher.
You listen to me, you neophyte toady.
I am in the middle of a party here.
I should not have to deal with this.
Put me through to your boss!
Listen, why don't you girls
go in the back room?
I'll meet you back there.
I've got some things
to take care of.
Did you know who she was?
- Excuse me?
- Did you knew she was my blood?
Jack, are we gonna go through
this goddamn little dance again?
Go ahead.
Take out your gun in front
of all these people here.
Put one right between my eyes.
You couldn't handle jail
for the rest of your life.
I want to tell you something.
The man you want...
is that little piss-ass Kinnear.
Him and the old guy, so stop
breaking my balls, all right?
I'm a goddamn businessman trying
to stay afloat, just like you.
You're nothing like me.
Excuse me, wait a minute, Jack.
All of a sudden you care?
All of a sudden, what are you?
Some kind of fucking good guy?
- You're the bad brother, remember?
- I know who I am.
I would love to sit here
and jaw with you...
but I gotta get back to the talent.
Hey, uh, Jack.
Let it go.
Come on, Jack, let's
see what you got.
Hey, hey, hey, Jack, come on.
Goddamn, Jack.
Your little brother put up
a better fight than you.
You should finish what you start.
Yeah. Hey, you should fix
your tie a little bit there.
Have a good time.
Where is it, Richie?
You got a car?
Let's take a ride.
Where are we going?
Hey. Slow down! Turn the
lights back on, please.
- Come on.
- It's not my problem.
I didn't do it.
Slow down, please.
You're gonna kill us.
Please!
What do you want?
You want a clean slate?
Give me five minutes
in front of a laptop.
- Slow down, you're gonna kill us!
- That's the point, Jeremy.
Okay. You want money?
Name your price. I've got
more money than God!
You need a drink.
It's okay.
It's all right.
Is this how you did
it to Richie, huh?
This how you did it, Jeremy, huh?
You think he screamed too?
You like it?
I didn't kill your brother,
Mr. Carter!
<i>Get up.</i>
- You're making a mistake.
- Get up. Move!
Listen, you're making a mistake.
Cyrus told me your brother was gonna
go to the police with this disc.
He said if he went down,
I'd go down, okay?
I didn't know what
to do, Mr. Carter.
- So you had him killed.
- No!
I just told him to get the
disc back, that's all.
I had nothing to do with it.
I told Cyrus to get the disc.
I said to get the disc...
and our business would be over.
That's all. Mr. Carter,
I swear to you!
I swear I didn't do anything.
I didn't kill him, Mr. Carter.
Please believe me!
He said if I said anything...
he would ruin me!
And then you came...
You came along and...
Please, Mr. Carter!
Please. It was Cyrus!
He killed your brother
and Geraldine, not me.
He said he was working
with some guy.
- They did it.
- No more talk.
Turn around.
- Please, don't.
- Turn around.
Be a man for once in your life.
I'm gonna do something for you...
nobody ever did for me.
I'm gonna give you a second chance.
Please don't make me come back.
No.
I won't, Mr. Carter. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you so much.
I promise I won't
make you come back.
Thank you.
Hey.
What are you doing?
Sorry, Jack.
I don't usually, uh, get my hands
dirty, but I checked your room...
and there was nothing there.
Listen. About this...
Doreen thing.
She'll be all right, I think.
Kids are resilient, you know?
And, uh, this thing with Richie, I mean,
Christ, that was bloody awful.
I don't know what Cyrus was thinking,
but a man's got to make a living.
I tried to keep you out...
but you insisted on this
<i>post facto</i> big-brother thing.
So I figured...
if I left enough dangling...
you would find my disc for me.
What a mess, eh?
All over a shiny piece of plastic.
Listen.
I'll get rid of the disc.
You got rid of
everything else, so...
You may have hardware
concealed about your person.
But remember:
You kill me, you'll be on the
run for the rest of your life.
It's been nice knowing you, Jack.
Brumby.
I'm not turning around.
Suit yourself.
Uncle Jack.
Your mother told me
I'd find you here.
- I thought you were gone.
- I am gone. I just wanted to...
say goodbye to you, face to face.
- What happened to your beard thing?
- Oh, that?
I thought it was time for a
change. I just got rid of it.
Did you fall again?
This?
Yeah, I did. I fell down again.
I'll get new shoes.
We'll be okay, you know.
Mom and me.
I know.
Thanks for being here.
It would've meant a lot to Dad.
- He was a good man.
- Yeah.
Guess you gotta go?
Yeah.
Remember when
I said you're special?
You better remember or you'll
have a big problem with me.
Okay.
Take care of yourself, Doreen.
You too.
Hey.
I like the new look.
Yeah.
