If this isn't an insanely beautiful woman,
I'm hanging up.
Sir, I-I think you should listen to this.
Agh!
<i>- Goddamn it!
- Sir?</i>
Sir?
Come on, baby,
come on, baby, come on!
This better not be
another damn Russian spy job!
Boys at air traffic say
the skies are clear.
It's the real thing.
A radio signal from another world.
Let's not jump the gun here.
Get online with Space Command.
They're gonna want to know...
What's with the golf balls?
You're gonna kill me here!
Wait, this can't be right.
The calculated distance from source...
...is only 375,000km.
It's coming from the moon.
- Who else knows about this?
- S.E.T.I. in New Mexico identified a signal.
But, uh... they're even more
confused than we are, sir.
Excuse me.
- Major!
- Yes, sir.
Radar reception has been impaired...
...but we were able to get these.
We estimate that it has
a diameter of over 550km...
...and a mass roughly
one fourth the size of our moon.
What the hell is it?
- A meteor?
- No, sir.
- No, definitely not.
- How do you know?
Well, sir, it's slowing down.
- It's what?
- It's, uh...
It's slowing down, sir.
Get me the Secretary of Defense.
Then wake him!
<i>- Hello.
- Hi.</i>
<i>- It's me.
- Hi.</i>
<i>- What time is it there?
- It's 2:45 in the morning.</i>
- <i>I know I didn't wake you.</i>
- <i>As</i> a <i>matter of fact, you did.</i>
Liar.
I have a confession to make.
I'm sleeping next to
a beautiful, young brunette.
<i>You didn't let her stay up
all night watching TV?</i>
<i>- Did you?
- Of course not.</i>
- You're coming home after the luncheon?
- <i>Yes, yes.</i>
- Mommy?
- Here's your mother.
- <i>Hi, honey!</i>
- <i>Hi,</i> I <i>miss you.</i>
<i>President Whitmore's approval ratings
have slipped below 40 percent.</i>
He's good.
<i>Are the salad days over
for President Whitmore?</i>
<i>Leadership as a Gulf War pilot
is different from leadership in politics.</i>
Daddy let me watch Letterman.
- <i>Traitor.</i>
- <i>They elected</i> a <i>warrior and got</i> a <i>wimp.</i>
- Morning, George.
- Morning, Mr. President.
That game couldn't have been pretty.
Thank you, sir.
Connie, you're up awfully
early this morning.
They're not attacking your policies.
They're attacking your age.
"Whitmore seems less like the president...
“and more like the orphaned child Oliver
asking, 'Please, sir, I'd like some more."'
- That's clever.
- Well, I'm not laughing.
Age was never an issue
when you stuck to your guns.
You were thought of as young, idealistic...
Now... the message has gotten lost.
It's just too much politics.
It's too much compromise.
Isn't it amazing how quickly
everyone can turn against you?
It's a fine line between standing
behind a principle and hiding behind one.
You can tolerate a little compromise...
...if you're actually managing
to get something accomplished.
Well...
The Orange <i>County Dispatch</i> has voted you
one of the 10 sexiest men of the year.
That's...
That's accomplishing something!
Mr. President, it's the
secretary of defense.
Yes.
Could... you say that again?
<i>Temperature is
95° in Central Park...</i>
<i>Let's go to Nick Jones and get us a
travel report for the beaches...</i>
So why are you waiting, hmm?
My Social Security will expire,
you'll still be sitting there.
- I'm thinking.
- Yeah, well, think already!
Do you know how long it takes
for those cups to decompose?
If you don't move soon,
I'll start to decompose.
Ah!
Listen, David,
I've been meaning to talk with you.
- It's nice that you see me so much now...
- Don't start, Dad.
It's been... what? Four years?
You're still wearing a wedding band?
- Three years.
- All right, three... four.
You're divorced, move on.
This is not healthy.
No, this is not healthy.
The smoking is not healthy.
- Checkmate.
- Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
- Wait a minute. This is not Checkmate.
- See you tomorrow, Pop.
Just hold on! This is not Checkmate.
Oh... Checkmate!
We've got everybody we have
working on the problem.
Yeah, I love <i>X-Files,</i> too.
I hope you get to see it.
David! David!
What's the point in having a beeper
if you don't turn it on?
It was turned on. I was ignoring you.
What's the... What's the big emergency?
It started this morning.
Every station's making like it's the 1950s.
We got static, snow, all
kinds of distortions.
- Marty.
- Nobody knows...
There's a reason
we have bins labeled "Recycle"!
What the hell is going on?
My God in heaven!
So sue me. David! We got a problem!
Did you switch transponder channels?
Oh, please! You think I'd be this panicked
if it was so simple?
Okay, let's point the dish
at another satellite.
We tried that. It didn't work.
It's almost as though they weren't there.
All right. What have we got here?
This is impossible.
<i>We created a race of robots.
Their function is to...</i>
- The signal's all screwed up.
- Stop it! Just leave it alone. You'll break it!
Oh, it's so fuzzy.
Oh, no.
Good morning, Lucas.
You see these?
I got a whole goddamn crop full of these.
If your father's not in
the air in 20 minutes...
...I'm getting someone else.
- Russell!
- Hey, Miguel!
Agh!
Whoo!
Ya-hoo!
Russell! What are you doing?
Just what in the hell
do you think you're doing?
Whoa!
It's the wrong field, you idiot!
Lucas's farm's on the other side of town!
Are you sure?
CNS is running a story that we're
covering up a nuclear-testing experiment.
They can run with it
if they want to embarrass themselves.
NASA wants to know our position.
Our official position is...
...we have no official position.
- Connie!
- What is going on here?
Guys, would I keep you out of the loop?
- Yes.
- Absolutely.
What? I can't hear you.
At the moment
our satellites are somewhat unreliable.
Isn't it possible
that this thing may just pass us by?
What if it doesn't pass us by?
Why don't we target some ICBMs
to blow it up?
And risk turning
one dangerous falling object into many?
We don't yet know enough
to make any kind of intelligent judgments.
Luckily the press is making up
their own story for now.
But that's not gonna keep.
- We may need to upgrade to DEFCON 3.
- Absolutely.
- General, tell NORAD we're on DEFCON 3.
- That's not what the president said.
Isn't that a little premature?
We have over 50 percent of the armed forces
on weekend leave.
Plus the commanders and troops that are
in town for the Fourth of July parade.
The object has settled
into a stationary orbit.
- Well, that's good news.
- Uh, not really, sir.
Part of it has broken off
into nearly three dozen pieces.
Smaller than the whole, sir...
...yet over 15 miles in width themselves.
Where are they heading?
They should enter our atmosphere
within the next 25 minutes.
Take us to DEFCON 3.
- Please say we're getting somewhere.
- There's good news and bad news.
- All right. What's the bad news?
- There's a penalty for disturbing my lunch.
And the good news is you won't charge me.
No. The good news is that
the problem is not our equipment.
It's some weird signal
embedded in the satellite feed.
And that's the good news?
Yeah. This signal has a sequential pattern,
so once I find the exact binary sequence...
...I can calculate the phase reversal
and apply it.
We should be able to block it out.
And then we'll be the only guys in town
with a clear picture!
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Oh, David! That's why I love you!
Oh! That's not necessary.
Too kind.
- This had better be good.
- Admiral on deck!
Sir, we're looking at a total
radar blackout over a 13km area.
- Let's do a diagnostic check.
- Excuse me, sir.
The radar may be malfunctioning,
but the infrared is totally off the map.
Jeez!
Get me Atlantic Command.
Hang on, sir.
Sir, we have visual range with incoming
over Iraqi air space.
- Second sighting?
- Yes, sir. Just came in from the Persian Gulf.
Correction, sir.
<i>We have two confirmed visual contacts.</i>
Mr. President, they're tracking another one
off the California coastline!
All right, put it on.
General, you might wanna watch this.
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, we are
interrupting our regular broadcast...</i>
<i>...to bring you extraordinary events
taking place in the Russian Republic.</i>
<i>This unexplained disturbance
and the resulting hysteria are incredible.</i>
<i>How would you describe
what you are seeing?</i>
<i>It is clearing the mountains,
moving too slowly...</i>
<i>...to be a comet or meteor.</i>
<i>Widespread panic
has gripped the countryside...</i>
<i>...as thousands have taken to the streets.</i>
<i>It is confirmed. The unexplained
phenomenon is headed for Moscow.</i>
Mr. President,
we have an AWAC off the West Coast.
ETA with contact point, three minutes.
Don't understand it, sir.
Side radar doesn't see a thing.
I know! I'm blind, sir.
Nothing is registering.
Negative. We have zero visibility.
Visibility is at zero.
Command, this is Eagle Eye 370.
Captain, the president is listening.
Repeat what you just told me.
<i>We still have zero visibility.</i>
<i>Instrumentation is malfunctioning.</i>
<i>We can't get any kind of reading
on what's in front of us.</i>
<i>Wait a minute.</i>
<i>It may be clearing.</i>
Pull out!
- Line's gone, sir.
- Two more spotted over the Atlantic.
One's moving toward New York,
the other here.
- How long do we have?
- Less than 10 minutes.
Alex, organize a military escort.
Mr. President, I recommend
we move you to a secure location.
- Connie, can we expect the same panic?
- More than likely.
- We can discuss this on the way.
- I'm not leaving.
We have to maintain a working government.
Take the vice president, the whole cabinet,
and the joint chiefs to a secured location.
I'm staying.
I don't want to add to a public hysteria
that's gonna cost lives.
Connie, we'll initiate
the emergency broadcast system.
We'll advise people not to panic.
The best idea right now
is to stay in their homes.
Yes, sir. Roy? Dean?
Have the cabinet members rendezvous here,
we'll take them to NORAD.
Mr. President, with your permission,
I'd like to remain at your side.
I had a feeling you would.
And what happens
if they do become hostile?
Then God help us.
<i>There it is.
The strange atmospheric phenomenon.</i>
<i>It is apparently what is causing
all the distortions...</i>
David, are you watching this?
<i>There is no evidence that
these phenomena are endangering anyone.</i>
<i>Thus far, reports of oppression...</i>
Marty, listen to this. I got a lock on that
signal pattern so we can filter it out.
But if my calculations are right,
it'll be gone in seven hours.
It's reducing itself every
time it recycles...
...so eventually it'll disappear...
- Are you listening?
- Can you believe this?
David, haven't you been watching? David!
<i>Good afternoon. So far the phenomenon
has not caused any damage.</i>
We have to ask you to stay calm, and it's
important for everyone not to panic.
<i>We have a fix on three
of the occurrences about to appear...</i>
- It's just unreal.
- Hey, Miguel, come here!
<i>One is headed towards Los Angeles...</i>
<i>...the other two are headed towards
New York and Washington, DC.</i>
Marty. Marty! Jamie says this building
has an old bomb shelter.
We're heading down there now.
Okay, everybody! Head down to the basement.
Take it slow, don't run.
Walk down to the basement!
There's no shame in hiding.
Oh, I'd better call my mother.
Well, look who we have here.
Russ, I heard you had
a little trouble this morning.
Dusted the wrong field.
I know you're probably still a little
confused from your hostage experience.
Hostage experience?
Did something happen to you, Russ?
Years back, he was kidnapped by aliens. Did
all kind of experiments on him and such.
Tell them about it, Russ. Get a few beers
in him and he'll tell you all about it.
Won't you, Russ?
Russ, when they took you up
in their spaceship, did they do any...
...sexual things?
Do you recall? Do you recollect?
Well, wake up!
What's happening?
What's going on?
- What's that?
- Let's get out of here, come on!
Wow!
Mommy, look it!
It's too early, baby.
Is it an earthquake?
Not even a four-pointer.
Go back to sleep.
Daddy!
What are you doing here?
- You should be down in the shelter.
- What's going on?
- Aren't you coming, David?
- I gotta see this.
Oh, man! What is that?
The signal!
My God!
Now what do we do?
Address the nation.
There's gonna be
a lot of frightened people out there.
Yeah.
I'm one of them.
', hey, hey! Come on!
He's just trying to impress you.
If you wanna impress me,
you need to get a job...
...and stop slobbering all over my shoes.
I don't believe this. Jasmine!
Neighbors are moving out. I guess
they finally got tired of all these quakes.
A little shake and they running.
<i>Police and fire departments
want everyone to stay off the phone.</i>
There's something on the news
about the quake!
- What's up, man?
- Hey, Steve.
- What you doing going out there?
- Shooting aliens.
Oh, you shooting aliens.
You think you're tough, huh?
What you got? Turn around.
Come on, let's get you something to eat.
Watch out! Watch it now!
- I'm gonna go grab the paper.
- All right.
Ow! Dylan!
Come on, honey, let's go!
Babe, you want some of this coffee?
Babe?
Boom! Boom! Boom!
<i>Pentagon officials are warning
more ships have just arrived...</i>
<i>...over the capitals
of India, England, and Germany...</i>
<i>...bringing estimates up to between 10
and 15 of these city-size spacecraft.</i>
I know, Ma. Just try and stay calm.
Tell her to pack up and leave town.
- Why? What happened?
- Just do it!
Ma! Ma, listen!
Uh... Get your stuff together
and head for Aunt Esther's.
Don't argue with me! Just go!
David! Why did I just
send my mother to Atlanta?
David! David, talk to me.
Didn't you hear me say that
the signal in the satellite feed...
...is recycling down to extinction?
- Not really.
- Countdown.
A countdown? A countdown to what, David?
It's like in chess. First you
strategically position your pieces.
Then, when the timing's right,
you... strike. See?
They're positioning themselves
all over the world...
...using this one signal
to synchronize their efforts.
In about six hours, the signal's gonna
disappear and the countdown will be over.
And then what?
Checkmate.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, I gotta call my brother.
I'd better call my housekeeper.
I gotta call my lawyer!
Ah, forget my lawyer.
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the president of the United States.</i>
<i>Good afternoon.</i>
<i>My fellow Americans...</i>
<i>...a historic and unprecedented event
has occurred.</i>
<i>The question of whether or not
we're alone in the universe...</i>
...has been answered.
Although it's understandable
that many of us feel hesitation or fear...
...we must attempt to reserve judgment.
He says he's your husband.
Oh, God...
- What do you want?
- You gotta leave the White House.
This is hardly the time
to be having that old discussion.
You gotta leave Washington.
In case you haven't noticed,
we are having a little crisis here!
They have a hidden signal.
They're gonna attack.
- You are just being paranoid!
- <i>It's</i> not paranoia!
The embedding's very subtle.
It was probably overlooked...
Marty, what are you doing?
Get out of town as soon as you can.
- Please?
- Okay.
<i>The staff and I will remain here
as we attempt to communicate.</i>
<i>If you feel compelled to
leave these cities...</i>
<i>...please do so in an orderly fashion.</i>
Excuse me! Coming through.
<i>The arrival of the aliens has caused...</i>
<i>...over 10,000 fender benders
in just a few seconds.</i>
<i>But this is just the beginning...</i>
- You can't go! You got to call them back!
- I'm not gonna do this with you, Jasmine.
- I've got to report to El Toro.
- You said you was on leave for the Fourth!
Yeah, well, they canceled it!
Look, why are you acting like this?
Why?
That's why!
Look... I really don't think...
...they flew go billion light years
to come and start a fight...
...and get all rowdy.
Look, why don't you just relax?
I'm gonna report to El Toro,
find out what's going on.
- What are you doing in there, man?
- Nothing, I'm just driving.
Look.
Hey, I got these for you.
- Firecrackers!
- You be careful.
Steve, wait.
- I wanna tell you something.
- What is it, Jasmine?
You take care of yourself, you hear?
Look, um...
Why don't you pack some things and you
and Dylan come stay with me on the base?
You will see that there is nothing
to be scared of.
Really?
You don't mind?
Well, I mean...
I will have to let
all my other girlfriends know...
...they can't come over.
I got to postpone the freaky deaky.
There you go, there he goes,
thinking you're all that.
But you are not as charming
as you think you are, sir.
Yes, I am.
Them big old Dumbo ears.
Look at you with them chicken legs.
Come on, Dylan.
Look out!
Hey! Whoa!
The television said they started looting.
Vultures.
- Do you still have the Plymouth?
- You wanna borrow the car?
- David, you don't have a license.
- You're driving.
- Yeah, I'm driv... I'm driving?
- Come on, come on!
I really want you out of Los Angeles.
You're staying there to keep people calm.
I won't let them criticize you for it.
- I appreciate your trying to help me.
- Liar. Stick to the truth. You're good at it.
Okay. I don't want you
in any one of those cities.
I'll leave
as soon as the interviews are done.
All right. There's a helicopter waiting.
They're taking you to Nellis.
- <i>And the</i> munchkin?
- She'll meet you there.
All right. I love you.
I love you.
<i>- Bye.
- Bye.</i>
<i>It's the</i> White <i>House!</i>
- You can't drive up and ring a bell.
- Can't this go any faster?
You think they don't know what you know?
They know! She works for the president.
- They know everything.
- They don't know this.
You're gonna educate them, huh?
So are you so smart?
How come you spent eight years
in MIT to become a cable repairman?
Dad...
All I'm saying is they got people
who handle these things.
If they want HBO, they'll call you.
Look at these people, look. Huh?
Vultures. They take and then they go.
They're going faster than we are.
We're in the fast lane!
- They're cutting me off.
- No one's cutting you off!
- They're getting in front. I can't go faster.
- I don't wanna argue.
Let's just get there as
quickly as possible.
You think we'll get to Washington
and it won't be there?

You don't wanna die a virgin... do you?
- Come on! We're going.
- No, I'm not going anywhere.
Miguel!
Stop it!
Thanks a lot, partner!
You read my mind!
Stay here.

with these enormous light panels...</i>
<i>...that are attached to the hull
and onto the sides.</i>
<i>Echo One,
Welcome Wagon is in the air.</i>
I repeat, Welcome Wagon is in the air.
<i>Roger, Welcome Wagon.
Echo One, right beside you.</i>
This is something I would never believe
that I would be!
In the White House! Look at this!
If I knew I was gonna meet the president,
I would have worn a tie.
Look at me, I look like a schlemiel.
You look fine, Pops.
Oy, my God!
- David, I don't know if he'll want to see you.
- Then we're wasting time, we should go.
- Why wouldn't he listen?
- Last time I saw him, we had a fight.
You walked in the room
and punched him in the head.
- The president!
- He wasn't president then.
I punched him, he fought back.
It was a fight!
A fight that you started!
David thought I was having an affair.
- With the president?
- Which I wasn't!
Either go get him,
or we should head back.
All right, I'll get him.
Wait here, and don't touch anything!
You punched the president?
God!
Nearing point of contact, Echo One.
- We're <i>closing in.</i>
<i>- Roger that. Begin sequence when ready.</i>
This I like.
Look at this!
You know what famous people
have been here? Hmm?
Yes, Dad.
Politicians... Actors...
Baseball players, singers...
And now me!
Imagine that! "A poor immigrant like me..."
- "It's a dream!"
- Shh! David, please!
<i>The three choppers are approaching...</i>
<i>...what has been unanimously agreed
to be the front of these spaceships...</i>
You're leaving now?
- See if they've got those pens they give away.
- Dad, what?
I don't have a choice...
- I don't have time for this.
- Two minutes, Tom, please.
Mr. President, Julius Levinson.
David is my son.
- I told you he wouldn't listen.
- You have to tell him now.
David, you have to tell him!
David, tell him!
Uh... I know why we have
satellite disruption.
All right. Go ahead.
Okay.
Let's say that you wanted to coordinate with
spaceships on different sides of the Earth.
They couldn't send a direct signal, right?
- You mean line of sight?
- Right. The curve of the Earth prevents it.
You'd need satellites to relay that signal
in order to reach each ship.
Well, I found a signal hidden inside...
...our own satellite system.
Excuse me, Mr. President. They're starting.
They're using our own
satellites against us.
The clock is ticking.
<i>- Bringing it in to hover.
- Welcome Wagon...</i>
<i>...Echo One. Approaching alien ship.</i>
Initiating communication sequence.
<i>Welcome Wagon has commenced.</i>
General Grey,
coordinate with the Atlantic Command.
- Tell them to evacuate people from the cities.
- Yes, sir.
Get those helicopters away from the ship.
Call them back!
- What the hell's going on?
- We're leaving.
Kim! My daughter.
Uh... There's something happening here.
They're responding.
<i>Something is happening.</i>
It looks like there's activity.
This may be a response, Echo One.
<i>We see it, too. Can't identify it.</i>
We are evacuating. I repeat,
we are evacuating the White House.
Load the rest of the staff
in the second helicopter.
- Is my wife in the air?
- She will be shortly.
Nice. Very nice.
Good! Close the door! Hatch secure!
We have our own phone.
Move out of here.
The president's ordered an evacuation.
<i>Our prayers go out to the pilots' families.</i>
<i>- Indeed, God help us all.
- Mrs. Whitmore.</i>
<i>The visitors responded with terrifying...</i>
<i>Authorities have called for
the evacuation of Los Angeles County.</i>
<i>People are advised to avoid
the highways wherever possible.</i>
Oh, yeah, great! Now he tells me.
<i>This is the Los Angeles Police Department.</i>
<i>Please vacate the premises immediately
for your own safety.</i>
- Can we move it along?
- Dr. Katz's office.
- Hello. Dr. Katz, please.
- I'm sorry, he's not available.
For $300 an hour, you can put me
through to his house in the Hamptons!
<i>This is the Los Angeles Police Department.</i>
<i>Please vacate the premises immediately
for your own safety.</i>
Mrs. Whitmore!
<i>You must leave now.</i>
No!
The First Lady's secured.
We're on the move.
They're opening UP!
It's so pretty.
Get the hell out of here!
Go ahead, pilot.
We're ready to take off right now.
Can we get a blanket for Patricia?
Here.
Time's up.
Oh, crap.
Oh, my God! Come on, Dylan! We gotta go!
Come on, Boomer!
Boomer!
Boomer!
<i>Reports are unclear
as to the extent of the devastation...</i>
<i>...but it appears that Los Angeles,
Washington, and New York are in ruins.</i>
Good God!
I've been saying it.
I've been saying it for ten damn years!
Ain't I, Miguel?
Huh? I've been saying it!
Dad, I'm sick. I don't feel good.
Pull it over, man.
- We're gonna be all right, Troy.
- Yeah, leave me alone. I got it.
Miguel!
Look at all that.
We could have evacuated
the cities hours ago.
That's the advantage of
being a fighter pilot.
In the Gulf War, we knew what we had to do.
This is just...
...not simple any more.
A lot of people died today.
How many didn't have to?
Any news on my wife yet?
The helicopter never made it to Nellis.
No radio contact.
Come on, Dylan. Stay close.
Here it is.
What happened, Mommy?
I don't know, baby.
You men will be the first wave
in our counterattack.
Our target is to the north...
...centered above what remains
of downtown Los Angeles.
Our Black Knight Squadron...
- Are you scared, man?
- Nope.
- You?
- Nope.
- Hold me!
- Hey, hey, pay attention.
Something you wanna add, Captain Hiller?
No, sir. Just a little anxious
to whup ET's ass, that's all.
You'll get your chance.
You'll all get your chance.
Good hunting.
Dismissed!
Let's kick the tires and light the fires,
Big Daddy!
Ready to go, sir!
Let's bring it home.
Bring that bad boy home, captain!
- You loose?
- Yes, sir!
- Got your victory dance?
- Oh, I got it right here... yeah!
Hey, don't get pre-patrol on me.
We don't light up till the fat lady sings.
I'm all ears, brother!
You the man!
- All right, gentlemen, we're on.
- General, it's NORAD.
General Grey here.
<i>N'?</i>
All communications with
the cities are down.
- All systems gone.
- For intelligence, we believe it's a total loss.
How about our boys? Where are they?
ETA to target, four minutes.
I shouldn't have left her.
Don't worry about it, big man.
I'm sure she got out of here
before it happened.
Or, as the good Reverend would say...
..."Why <i>we're on
this particular mission, we'll never know."</i>
"But I do know, here today...
...that the Black Knights
will emerge victorious once again."
- Amen, man!
- Amen, Reverend.
Holy God!
Lock and load!
Roger that. L.A. attack squadron
has Amraam missiles locked on target.
Washington and New York squadrons
report lock-on.
Fire at will.
- Fire at will.
- Fire at will.
Knights, we are red and free.
Knight One, fox three!
Knight Three, fox three!
Knight Seven, fox three.
Missiles have been fired.
- Are they not getting through?
- No, sir, not one.
Command, Knight One.
Switching to Sidewinders, moving in.
Knight Three, low 50 knots reference 120.
Knight Seven, 120.
Knight One, sweep lock. Fox two.
Knight Seven...
Come on, come on!
They must have a protective shield
over the hull! Knights, pull up!
- Knight Three, pull up!
- Complete failure in the stators!
Pull up!
Agh!
Blow through, blow through!
Too many of them!
They got another one, sir.
Oh, no, you did not shoot
that green shit at me!
I got you covered, Big Daddy!
Damn, they got shields, too!
Let's go, Knights! Move, Knights! Move!
Jesus!
They got another one, sir. And two more.
- They're dropping like flies.
- We're losing it.
All right, get them out of there.
Squadron leaders, retreat to fallback
position. Abort mission right away!
We're gonna have to make a run for
this one! Let's get low and fast!
I gotcha, Big Daddy! Let's get them!
Whoo!
Watch the deck!
- Squadron leader, abort! Abort!
- This isn't happening fast enough!
Get them out!
- The monitor! Where's the picture?
- We've lost the satellite.
- We got two on our six, Jimmy. Shackle!
- Roger.
Come on, come on! Move, move, move!
- It's gonna be like white on rice, Big Daddy!
- They ain't got nothing for us! Let's push it!
- I can't shake them.
- Yes, you can. Just the way I showed you.
- I'm gonna try something.
- Nothing stupid!
- You know me!
- That's what I mean.
- Aah!
- Jimmy, you can't bank at that speed!
<i>Jimmy, he's closing on you!</i>
- Put your mask back on! That's an order!
- I can't breathe!
Jimmy!
Jimmy!
Jimmy, no!
Affirmative. We have incoming.
- Let me have it, son.
- You got it.
Friendly?
Sergeant?
I don't think so.
Come on and get me!
What are you shooting at?
Where you at, baby?! Come on! Come on!
You can't hit nothing!
Whoa! Low bridge!
See if you can fly that thing under cover!
Ha-ha! Hope you got an airbag!
Whoo!
Aah!
Son of a bitch!
Aah!
That's right! That's right!
Get off! Get off of me!
That's what you'll get! Ha-ha!
Look at you!
Ship all banged up! Who's the man?!
Huh? Who's the man?!
Wait till I get another plane!
I'm lining all your friends up,
right beside you!
Where you at? Huh? Where you at?
Welcome to Earth.
That's what I call a close encounter.
Baby, stay right here.
Stay right here with Boomer.
Keys. Come on, keys.
Yes!
Come, baby, come on. Come on!
<i>(Yes).!</i>
<i>Reports indicate that this battle
has repeated itself all over the world...</i>
<i>...with the same results.</i>
You're just like your mother, you
know that? She was stubborn too.
I had to twist her arm
to get her to take her medicine.
- You're gonna be all right.
- You're gonna be fine.
See, Troy? You're feeling better already.
I couldn't find anything.
Everyone's packing up. They're leaving.
- They said a spaceship is headed this way.
- We'd better leave too, then.
Penicillin. It'll help keep his fever down.
Thank you. It's really
nice of you to help us.
I wish I could do more,
but we're moving out.
I-I'm going with you.
Um... Well... l-
 just mean that...
that we're going too.
Cool.
Tell that punk to shut the door. We're out
of here. He can sniff around somewhere else.
- Bye.
- Bye.
It's Air Force One, for crying out loud.
Still he gets sick.
- I don't feel too good.
- Look at me, huh? Like a rock.
Could be bad weather or good weather.
We could go up or down.
We could go back, we could go forwards,
side to side...
What did I say?
- He still gets airsick, huh?
- Yeah.
Julius, with all of this, I, uh...
I didn't get a chance to thank you two.
All he could think of was getting to you.
There's still love there, I think.
Love was never a problem.
All you need is love.
John Lennon. Smart man.
Shot in the back, very sad.
We've moved as many of
our forces away from our bases as possible.
- But we've already sustained heavy losses.
- I spoke with the joint chiefs at NORAD.
They agree we must counterattack
with a full nuclear strike.
Over American soil?
You're saying we should sacrifice
more innocent American civilians?
If we don't strike soon,
there may not be much of an America left!
Sir! They've taken out NORAD.
- What?
- It's gone, sir.
My God!
The vice president? The joint chiefs?
Mr. President.
We must launch.
A delay now would be more costly than
when you waited to evacuate the cities.
You're not gonna launch nuclear weapons.
You'll kill them and us. If we fire nukes...
- Sir, may I remind you, you are a guest here?
- You ever hear of nuclear winter?
- It's the end of life as we know it.
- Just go.
I don't have to go. It can't be allowed!
- Shut up! Captain, get him out!
- Don't tell him to shut up!
You'd all be dead now
if it wasn't for my David!
None of you did anything to prevent this!
There was nothing we could do.
We were totally unprepared for this.
- Don't give me unprepared!
- Come on, Julius.
It was, what?
In the 1950s, you had that spaceship.
- Dad. Look, Dad...
- Yeah, that thing you found in New Mexico!
- Where was that?
- No, not the spaceship.
Roswell. Roswell, New Mexico.
No, you had the spaceship and the bodies!
- Come on.
- They were locked up in a bunker.
Where was that?
Area 51 . Right?
Area 51. You knew then!
And you did nothing.
Sir.
Regardless of what
you may have read in the tabloids...
...there have never been any spacecraft
recovered by our government.
- Take my word for it. There's no Area 51.
- Psh...
And there's no recovered spaceship.
Uh, excuse me, Mr. President...
That's not entirely... accurate.
What? Which part?
Hold on, everybody! Hold on!
Sorry.
The end hath come!
He spaketh his word and the end hath come!
Hop on! We're heading out to El Toro!
You cannot defy what hath come!
<i>It's the end!</i>
El Toro?!
- Can you give me a hand?
- Sure.
Oh, God...
Okay, okay, let's get this off.
Here, let me help you.
She's hurt pretty badly.
You know, this was supposed to be
my weekend off.
But, no!
You got me out here, dragging your heavy
ass through the burning desert...
...with your dreadlocks
sticking out the back of my parachute.
You gotta come down here
with an attitude...
...acting all big and bad.
And what the hell is that smell?!
Arrrrgh!
I could've been at a barbecue!
But I ain't mad.
It's all right, it's all right.
Hey!
Hey! Hey...
Hey!
Do you need a lift, soldier?
When I flew overhead,
I saw a base not too far from here.
It ain't on the map.
Trust me, it's there.
Attention!
Mr. President. General.
Welcome to Area 51. Please follow me.
We're now 24 floors beneath the surface...
...and, uh... here's our
main research facility.
- Let's see it.
- Sorry, sir, it's a clean room. It's static free...
Open... the door.
Yes, sir.
My God.
Why the hell wasn't I
told about this place?
Two words, Mr. President.
Plausible deniability.
I don't understand.
Where does all this come from?
How do you get funding
for something like this?
You don't actually think
they spend $20,000 on a hammer...
"$30,000 on a toilet seat, do you?"
Mr. President, this is Dr. Okun.
He has headed up the research department
on this project for the last 15 years.
How do you do?
<i>Mr. President!</i>
Wow!
Uh... This...
What a pleasure!
As you can imagine, they...
They don't let us out much.
I can understand that.
Well!
I guess you'd like to see
the big tamale, huh?
Follow me.
She's a beaut, ain't she?
As you can see from the repairs, we've been
trying to put her back together since the '60s.
You've had this for 40 years
and you know nothing about them?
Oh, hell, no.
No, no, no, no. We know tons about them.
But the neatest stuff...
The neatest stuff has
only happened in the last few days.
We can't duplicate their type of power
so we've never been able to experiment.
But since these guys started showing up,
all the little gizmos inside turned on.
The last 24 hours
have been really exciting!
Exciting? People are dying out there.
Exciting isn't the word
I'd choose to describe it!
You guys are hoping to fly this thing, huh?
You said you can repair their technology.
- Can you tell us anything useful about them?
- Oh, yeah. Well, I mean...
They're not all that dissimilar from us.
Breathes oxygen,
comparable tolerances to heat, cold.
Probably why they're
interested in our planet.
Hey...
<i>Hey-</i>
You guys wanna see them?
Hmm?
Uh, this is...
This is the vault.
Or, as some of us have come to call it...
<i>...the</i> freak show.
When we found them...
...they were wearing
some sort of biomechanical suits.
Once we got them off, we learned a
great deal about their anatomy.
Eyes, ears...
...no vocal cords.
We assume they communicate
with each other by some other means.
You're obviously not thinking
about hand signals and body language.
No, it's some kind of
extrasensory perception. Telepathy.
So...
It's an organic life form.
Can they be killed?
Their bodies are just as frail as ours.
These two died in the crash.
This one a few weeks later.
You just... have to get through
their technology, which is...
...I'm sorry to say, far more advanced.
David, you unlocked part
of their technology.
- You cracked the code.
- No, no. All I did was stumble on their, um...
...signal. I don't know
how, uh... helpful I can be.
Why don't you show him
what you've discovered so far?
Figure out what they
haven't thought of yet.
We'll see if you're as smart
as we all hope you are.
What code?
Captain Steven Hiller,
United States Marine Corps.
I'm sorry, captain. You
don't have clearance.
Okay. Come here.
You wanna see my clearance?
- Maybe I'll just leave this here with you.
- Let them pass.
- Let them pass!
- Get the hell out of the way!
Did you see that?
Come on down.
Watch your step.
Well, obviously this cockpit
was designed to seat three.
Though how they sat on them, I don't know.
<i>Gently.</i>
- Uh... You see these gizmos flashing?
- Yeah.
We've been working around the clock
trying to get a fix on all this.
Some stuff we figured out right away.
Uh... This we're pretty sure
is the life support for the cabin.
And, uh...
this doohickey is connected to...
Oh... Well, it was connected to the engine.
Here, take that, will you?
Uh... These configurations... uh...
Well... To be honest,
we don't know what the hell this crap is.
But this is clearly what they use
to guide and navigate their craft.
Ha-ha! Neat, huh?
Uh, could somebody grab my laptop there?
Can I just have the computer inside?
What?
These patterns are repeating sequentially,
like their countdown signal.
They're using that frequency
for computer communications.
See? That's how
they're coordinating their ships.
You know...
...you're really starting
to make us look bad.
They got one! They got one alive!
- They got one, alive!
- Jesus!
Uh... You'll be okay by yourself, Dave?
Fine.
Uh... Don't touch anything.
Everybody's always telling me
not to touch anything.
Oh! It's all wet...
Right here! He's in the back of the pickup.
General, sir. Captain Steven Hiller,
United States Marine Corps.
Guess who's coming to dinner!
I need a doctor. I need a doctor!
Oh, boy! How long
has he been unconscious?
- About three hours.
- Let's get him in containment.
My son... he's very sick.
He needs immediate attention!
He's drying out.
I want him sprayed down with saline.
He has a problem with his adrenal cortex!
Please!
If you don't do something right now,
my son will die!
- Just help him!
- Okay. O'Haver, Miller, you come with us.
You... take us to him, okay? Let's go.
All right! Move it, move it, move it!
As the former head of the CIA,
you knew about this place.
When were you planning to inform us?
- It had been deemed classified.
- You should have told us about this
when they first arrived!
You should have warned us
before we launched a counterattack...
...that cost the lives of
hundreds of our pilots!
We could not have known that our fighters
would have been that ineffective!
Mr. President.
The little bit of information we have
comes directly into this room.
Atlanta, Chicago, and Philadelphia.
Destroyed.
NATO and Western Allied installations
were the first to be taken out.
Then we were hit.
They knew exactly where and how to hit us.
- And our forces?
- We're down to 15 percent.
If you calculate the time it takes
to destroy a city and move on...
...we're looking at the worldwide
destruction of every major city...
...in the next 36 hours.
We're being exterminated.
Mr. President!
This is Captain Steven Hiller.
- Captain.
- Mr. President.
Well done.
- Where is it now?
- It's isolated in the containment lab, sir.
I'd like to go see it.
General, I'm really anxious
to get back to El Toro.
Hasn't anyone told you?
El Toro has been completely destroyed.
- We were lucky.
- Yeah!
Today was the first time I used the subway.
Thank God for the Metro Rail.
These should last us a while.
Don't move. I'll get it for you.
Stay still.
He's your son?
He's my angel.
Was his father stationed here?
No, he, uh...
He wasn't his father.
But I was kind of hoping
he wanted the job, though.
- So what do you do for a living?
- I'm a dancer.
Oh... Ballet...
No. Exotic.
Oh... Sorry.
Don't be. I'm not.
It's good money. Besides...
...my baby's worth it.
Dylan! Come here.
I want you to meet the First Lady.
- Hello.
- Hi.
I didn't know that you'd recognized me.
Well, I didn't want to say nothing.
I voted for the other guy.
- Life-support monitors recording.
- So if we screw up, it's all on tape.
Come on, come on.
Let's get this biomechanical suit off.
Put the spreader right
here, along the ridge.
Microprobe thingamajig goes right here.
Pick there. Good.
All right, now spread it very, very gently.
Let me get in.
Gentle, gentle, that's it.
Run this right in...
All right. Okay.
Let's proceed.
Now comes the... the really icky part.
Ugh!
Oh, boy.
This is one smelly, disgusting...
Oh, look at it.
It doesn't look alive, does it?
The arm is moving.
- Agh!
- Doctor? Doctor?
Doctor?
- Agh!
- Don't move!
Dr. Okun?
<i>Release... me.</i>
- Open the door. Get him out!
- No, wait.
Release me...
...now.
I know there is much
we can learn from each other...
...if we can negotiate a truce.
We can find a way to coexist.
Can there be a peace between us?
Peace...
No peace.
What is it you want us to do?
Die.
Die!
Mr. President.
- Is that glass bulletproof?
- No, sir.
- Are you all right?
- I saw...
...his thoughts.
I saw what they're planning to do.
They're like locusts.
They're moving from planet to planet.
Their whole civilization.
After they've consumed
every natural resource, they move on.
And we're next.
Nuke them.
Let's nuke the bastards.
Just my luck. No ice.
I take it you've heard?
Hey, toast.
To the end of the world.
He didn't come to this decision lightly.
He didn't have any other choice.
Well, you still believe in him.
Well, he's a good man.
<i>Whoa...</i>
He'd better be. You left me for him.
Or, you know... for your career.
You know, it wasn't just my career.
It was the biggest opportunity of my life.
I wanted my life to make a difference.
I wanted my life to mean something.
And, um... I wasn't, um...
...ambitious enough for you?
David, you could have done anything
you wanted. Research, development...
Honey, I was happy where I was.
Haven't you ever wanted to be
part of something special?
I was part of something special.
Well, if it makes any difference...
...I never stopped loving you.
But that wasn't enough, was it?
Let's pick it up, man. Let's go!
Let's pick it up, man!
We're on a tight schedule!
Pick it up, man!
Pick it up!
What the hell are you doing?
Get out of there!
I got something I gotta handle.
I'm borrowing it.
No, you're not, sir.
Do you really wanna shoot me?
Just tell them I hit you.
<i>Command, this is Retal Op.</i>
Squadron is in the air. We are on
station and awaiting instructions.
Break formation. Head to targets.
Sir.
They're breaking formation.
- We're initiating sequence code.
- Verification: Alpha Zulu six eight niner.
Which city will be reached first?
Houston, Texas.
ETA, six minutes and counting down.
- Houston.
- The major cities have been deserted.
Civilian casualties should
be down to a minimum.
Command, this is Neighborhood Watch.
We are in position.
Tracking monitors are locked on.
We are going to visual recon.
<i>Roger.</i>
- We have confirmation.
- Launch code confirmed.
Alpha Zulu six eight niner, standing by.
Laser targeting.
Locked on.
We're locked on, sir.
Do you wish to deploy?
Mr. President,
if you wish to deploy, the time is now.
- Mr. President?
- Deploy.
That's a go. Alpha Zulu six eight niner.
Here we go.
Bird's away.
We have visual confirmation of the missile.
It's on target.
<i>Approaching.</i>
May our children forgive us.
<i>Five seconds to impact. Three, two...</i>
...one.
Oh, yeah! It's a hit!
Get down! Get down!
Can we confirm
that the target was destroyed?
Get the tank commander.
Confirm the target was destroyed.
Yes, sir!
Red Arrow, Alpha 9723. Can you read?
- Repeat. You're breaking up.
- We have <i>lost visual.</i>
Roger that. We're looking for confirmation.
- We got the bastards.
- Yeah!
Good job, everyone! Congratulations.
Commander, do you have visual?
We need visual confirmation.
Has the target been destroyed?
Negative.
<i>Target remains.</i>
<i>I repeat, target remains.</i>
Call the other planes back.
Other bombers might have more luck.
We shouldn't just give up on this!
I said call them back!
- Abort.
- Abort mission.
Issue the abort codes right away.
This is an abort, full abort. Do you read?
<i>Jasmine!</i>
You're late!
You know I like to make an entrance.
- Where are we going?
- Through there, sir.
Mr. President. Your wife is resting
comfortably for the moment.
- Perhaps if we had gotten to her earlier...
- Hey, there she is! Go on!
- She doesn't look too good.
- Your wife is bleeding internally.
- Perhaps if we'd gotten to her earlier...
- What are you saying?
We can't stop the bleeding.
If We'd...
There's nothing we can do for her.
We were worried.
We didn't know where you were.
You've gotten bigger, I think.
I did?
You just keep growing and growing.
I can't...
<i>Hey-</i>
Can you, uh, wait outside for a little bit
so Mom can get a rest?
Hey, come on, Munchkin.
I'm so sorry that I didn't come home
when you asked me to.
Oh...
It's okay.
The doctors...
...think that you're...
...gonna be just fine.
Liar.
Is Mommy sleeping now?
Yeah.
Mommy's sleeping.
<i>Hey-</i>
David!
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm making a mess!
Yeah. This I can see.
We gotta burn this toxic waste...
...pollute the air and rip up the ozone!
Because maybe if we screw
this planet up enough...
...they won't want it anymore.
Wait, wait, wait. David, David.
- Don't do this to yourself. Listen to me.
- I'm listening.
Everyone loses faith
at some point in their life.
David! Even myself.
I haven't spoken to God
since your mother died.
You see, sometimes...
...we have to remember what we still have.
Like what?
Well... you still have your health.
David, David, you need your rest.
Come on! Get off this freezing floor
before you catch cold. Come on!
- What did you just say?
- About faith?
- Well, you see, a man...
- No, no, no.
- No, the other part.
- What? What? I don't want you to catch cold.
Dahhh!
What is that? What is the matter with you?
- Genius.
- Genius?
My dad. A total genius.
Jerry, wake up.
We got work to do.
Get everybody down here right away.
Look at that!
Wow!
Does that thing really fly in outer space?
- It most certainly does.
- Sure doesn't look like it.
- They're here.
- All right, what's this all about?
I have no idea.
Get everybody off.
Right, everybody.
Clear the platform. Let's go.
Major Mitchell.
- Do you have a pistol?
- What?
- Have you got a gun?
- Sergeant, your sidearm.
See that, uh... Coke can
on top of the alien craft?
Think you can shoot that thing off?
Do it. Shoot it.
- Sir?
- Go ahead.
What the hell are you doing?!
I'm sorry. My fault, my fault.
You see, that Coke can
was protected by the craft's shield.
- We can't penetrate it.
- We know. What's your point?
My point is, if we can't beat their
defenses, then we gotta get around them.
Major. One more time... Any time.
- How did you do that?
- I gave it a cold.
I gave it a virus. A computer virus.
Are you telling us you
can send out a signal...
...that will disable all their shields?
That's right. Just like they used
our satellites against us...
...we can use their own
signal against them.
If we plant a virus into
that mother ship...
...it's gonna filter down
into all the corresponding ships below.
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
How exactly do we infect the mother ship
with this virus?
We're... We're gonna, uh...
...have to... um... fly their alien craft
out of our atmosphere and dock with it.
We can enter here,
as shown in these satellite photos.
We then upload the virus, set off some
kind of explosion which will disable it.
That'll disorient the smaller ships below
and that could buy you some time to, uh...
to... take them... take them out.
Take them down.
Do your... Do your stuff.
- This is ridiculous!
- How long would their shields be down?
Uh... I don't know. A matter of minutes.
You want us to coordinate
a worldwide counterstrike...
...with a window of a few minutes?
- With shields down, it might be possible.
- Oh, please!
We don't have the manpower or the resources
to launch that kind of a campaign!
Not to mention
that this whole cockamamie plan...
...depends on a machine that no one
in this world is qualified to operate.
I wouldn't say that, sir.
I've seen them in action. I'm aware
of their maneuvering capabilities.
With your permission, general,
I'd like the opportunity to try.
That thing is a wreck.
It crash-landed back in the '50s.
We don't even know if
it's capable of flying!
Jim, uh... remove the clamps.
Any questions?
Let's do it.
All right, you heard the president...
- Good luck, pilot.
- Thank you, Mr. President.
A virus.
Your idea.
That's right.
Do you really think you can fly that thing?
Do you really think
you can do all that bullshit you just said?
Whoo!
I understand you are upset
over your wife's death.
But that's no excuse
for making another fatal mistake.
No, my mistake was to appoint a sniveling
weasel like you as Secretary of Defense.
- You don't understand!
- However...
...that is one mistake I am thankful to say
that I don't have to live with.
- Mr. President...
- Mr. Nimziki...
...you're fired.
Let's organize every plane we can find
and get us some goddamn pilots to fly them.
Yes, sir.
He can't do that.
Well, he just, uh... did.
Command has attempted to list casualties
and losses, but information is sketchy.
We know we've lost
the Belgian contingent in the Sinai.
There's a strong possibility reinforcements
are hiding in the Golan Straits.
- What the hell's he saying?
- They're getting a signal. Old Morse code.
It's from the Americans.
They want to organize a counteroffensive!
It's about bloody time!
What do they plan to do?
We have confirmed reports
of combat-ready divisions...
- ...in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.
- Impressive. Considering it's all done with...
Morse code.
- The armed forces here?
- We have sufficient aircraft, but...
- But what?
- Pilots are coming up short.
Well, then, find them.
<i>Ham radio operators from New York to Japan
trade rumors of military forces in hiding...</i>
<i>...unwilling to reveal themselves
for fear of annihilation...</i>
We're planning to launch
a counteroffensive.
With our depleted manpower...
...we're asking that anyone with
flight experience come forward.
Military training is preferable,
but anyone who can fly would be useful.
I can fly. I'm a pilot.
All right, guys! Listen up!
Pay attention. These F-18s are
very different than the jets you piloted.
- It's strong.
- Forgive the expression...
...but this is a crash course
in modern avionics.
- Keep it coming.
- Okay, you got it!
All right, listen up. Before we begin...
...we need some background information
on your experience.
Let's start with you.
Who, me?
Well, I'm, uh, Russell Casse, sir.
And, uh... after 'Nam,
I got into crop-dusting.
And, uh... been doing that ever since.
On a personal note, sir,
I'd just like to add that, uh...
...ever since I was kidnapped
by aliens 10 years ago...
...I have been dying for some payback.
I just want you to know
that, uh... I won't let you down.
You have one tactical nuclear missile...
...we're loading into this launcher
under the right wing.
This is the firing mechanism.
It'll be attached to the
ship's main console.
Just like the Amraam launch pad
on a Stealth.
Except the nuke will not
detonate at impact.
You'll have 30 seconds
to get your asses out of there.
Good luck, gentlemen.
30 seconds.
It's the strongest radio transmitter we had.
It'll tell us when you've uploaded the virus.
30 seconds. Don't you think
that's cutting it too close?
We're gonna be well on our way back home
before we shoot that thing off.
Why you? David!
I don't... I don't understand...
...why you can't show
someone else how to plant the virus.
No, no. Something may go wrong.
I may have to think quickly,
adjust the signal.
Who knows? Hey, you know how
I'm always trying to save the planet?
Here's my chance.
Now he gets ambitious.
- It's too tight.
- Well, I had to borrow it. Let me see.
Okay. All right, I guess
that's good enough.
So. How do I look?
Oh, thank you. You're a lot of help.
- You're late!
- Well, you know me.
I know. You like to make a big entrance.
Listen. Before we do this,
I just wanna say I'm sorry.
Sorry for what, babe?
I should have done this a long time ago.
- Do you have the ring?
- Uh... Yes, sir.
- Here, make yourself useful.
- Ow!
Witnesses?
Um...
- We got hung up.
- Well, let's get this show on the road.
Dearly beloved,
we're gathered here in the sight of God...
...and in the presence
of these witnesses...
...to join this man and this woman
in holy matrimony.
Any person who can show good cause
why these two should not wed...
...please speak now
or forever hold your peace.
Steve, will you take this woman
to be your wedded wife...
...to live together with her
in the holy state of matrimony?
Will you love her, comfort her, honor
and keep her in sickness and in health...
...and, forsaking all others...
...keep yourself only for her
as long as you both shall live?
I Will.
<i>Whoo!</i>
Good morning.
They're a little young.
That they are.
They look a little nervous.
I need all flight crews
to report to their designated areas.
- Major. Can I borrow that?
- Sir.
Good morning.
<i>Good morning.</i>
In less than an hour...
...aircraft from here
will join others from around the world.
And you will be launching the largest
aerial battle in the history of mankind.
Mankind.
That... word should have
new meaning for all of us today.
We can't be consumed
by our petty differences any more.
We will be united in our common interest.
Perhaps it's fate
that today is the Fourth of July.
And you will once again
be fighting for our freedom.
Not from tyranny,
oppression or persecution.
But from annihilation.
We're fighting for our right to live.
To exist.
And should we win the day...
...the Fourth of July will no longer
be known as an American holiday...
...but as the day
when the world declared in one voice...
..."We will not go
quietly into the night!"
"We will not vanish without a fight!"
"We're going to live on!"
"We're going to survive!"
Today, we celebrate our Independence Day!
Yeah!
- Let's go!
- Mr. President. Right this way, sir.
- I've got your gear over here.
- Good luck!
I've got you a jumpsuit and your gear is
here. You've got your choice of helmets.
Mr. President,
I'd sure like to know what you're doing.
I'm a combat pilot, Will.
I belong in the air.
Okay, sir. Let's get you airborne.
As soon as I get back,
we're gonna light those fireworks, right?
Here. Take these.
Just in case.
Where's... Where's...
Just in case.
I'm very proud of you.
Be careful, okay?
It's time.
I love you.
I love you.
Oh, damn! Wait a minute, wait a minute.
- We gotta find some cigars. I can't...
- Here! Here!
Take these. My last two.
You are a lifesaver.
Almost put a hex on the whole damn thing!
<i>- Missile launch.
- Oh, crap!</i>
What do I hit? Which one?
I picked a hell of a day to quit drinking.
This is our victory dance.
Not until the fat lady sings.
Oh. Yes, okay.
This is important.
Fat lady. I gotcha.
Open launch tunnel.
Shaky, huh?
Is it gonna do this the whole way?
Make sure your seat backs
are in their upright position.
Yeah. Ls it?
Let's rock 'n' roll.
Oh!
Oops.
Oops? What does that mean?
No, I got it.
Some jerk didn't put the thing...
What do you mean, saying "oops" there?
What do you say we try that one again, huh?
Yes, yes. Yes, without the "oops".
Thataway!
I have got to get me one of these!
- No, no. What was that? Don't do that!
- Just trying to get a feel for the old girl.
No, no, don't. Leave her alone.
- Look, no hands!
- Steve!
- You're all secure, sir.
- Grey, do you read me?
Roger, Eagle One.
Your primary target has shifted course.
<i>- Which way they headed?</i>
- I <i>think our secret's out.</i>
They're headed straight for us.
<i>ETA, 26 minutes.</i>
You still with me over there?
What the hell was I thinking? Oh!
I've been waiting for this my whole life.
Head straight for it.
- What the hell...?
- Don't touch them. Don't, don't!
I was counting on this.
They are bringing us in.
- When the hell was you gonna tell me?
- Oops.
We've got to work on our communication.
We have visual.
Do not engage until we've confirmed...
<i>- ...the package has been delivered.
- Roger.</i>
Major, what happens if
that thing gets here...
...before the virus is planted?
This facility's buried
deep within a mountain.
- It should provide us some protection.
- Great.
What about the people outside?
Lieutenant Sell? We got incoming.
Oh, my God.
Look at that.
There must be thousands of them.
Millions of them. What
the hell are they doing?
Looks like they're preparing an invasion.
Hey, I don't like this!
This is stupid. They can see us.
No, no. This thing comes fully loaded.
AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats and...
...power windows.
Come on, baby.
We're in.
Do it. Do it.
Do it.
Sir, he's uploading the virus.
Eagle One, the package is being delivered.
<i>Stand by to engage.</i>
Roger. Eagle One, check left.
Listen up! We have an emergency situation.
We need you to grab everything you can.
Only what you can carry.
We need to get you inside immediately.
The virus is in.
All we can do now is... pray.
- Delivery complete. Engage.
- Delivery complete. It's a go!
Eagle One. Fox three.
Gentlemen, this is it.
Come on, come OH, come on.
Virus ineffective. Disengage.
- Get your people out.
- Disengage.
<i>Rear flank, follow suit.</i>
<i>Hold on, Command.</i>
- I want another shot at it.
- Sir, I strongly recommend you disengage.
Eagle One. Fox three.
- Direct hit!
- It's a hit! Squadron leaders, fire at will!
Fire at will!
We're going in. Squadron
leaders, take flight.
- Eagle Six at seven.
- Eagle Five at three.
Eagle One. Fox two.
Eagle Twenty! Fox two!
Evasive maneuvers!
Squadron leaders, evasive maneuvers!
Prepare to engage!
All right, Mr. President! Here we go!
All right, baby. I've gotcha!
Payback's a bitch, ain't it?
Okay. Job's done. Let's go home.
Gladly.
What's up?
It's stuck.
- What?
- It's not responding. It's stuck.
Try it again.
Come on, come on!
Come on, come on! Inside!
- Go to the elevator!
- Hurry!
Steve! Steve!
- What are you doing?
- They're overriding the system.
Oh, shit!
Um... Hide.
Everybody hold someone's hand.
Hold hands.
Come on in.
I'm not Jewish.
Nobody's perfect.
God! Where are they?
This could be our last night on Earth.
I don't wanna die a virgin.
If we do, we'll both die virgins.
But at least we'll be together.
Are you scared?
Me, too.
- Eagle Seven, fox two.
- Eagle Three, fox two.
We're running out of missiles, sir.
We're not causing enough damage.
It's directly over us.
They're preparing to fire
their primary weapon!
Then let's take it out
before it takes us out.
Target at 12 o'clock!
My God! They're everywhere!
- Bandits on our tail! Locked on!
- I see them.
Squadron leaders, I want a weapons check!
You're out of time!
You've gotta disable it now!
I'm in range. Locking on.
I've got tone. Eagle One, fox two!
That is a negative impact.
<i>That is an NI. Negative impact.</i>
I'm out of missiles. Eagle Two!
I'm on it.
Oh, Jesus!
- Sir, all missiles have been fired.
- Out of time! Get your ass out of there!
- We're not done yet!
- Get as far away as you can!
Doesn't anyone have any missiles left?
<i>Sorry I'm late, Mr. President!</i>
I got hung up back there!
- Pilot, you armed?
- Armed and ready, sir!
I'm packing!
- Who is that guy?
- Put him on speaker.
- Pilot, identify yourself.
- It's me!
<i>Russell Casse, sir.</i>
I told you I wouldn't let you down!
<i>Just keep those guys off me
for a few more seconds, will you?</i>
Okay. Echo Niner, Echo Seven, take flanking
positions. Look after this guy, okay?
All right, boys.
Let's give Mr. Casse some cover!
Gentlemen! Let's plow the road!
We'll draw them off and it's all yours!
Oh-ho! Look out! Coming through!
I've got tone.
Eagle Twenty. Fox two.
Eagle Twenty. Fox two.
It's jammed.
<i>It won't fire.</i>
Damn it!
Do me a favor.
Tell my children... I love them very much.
All right, you alien assholes!
In the words of my generation...
...up yours!
Dad! What's he doing?
<i>Come on, baby!</i>
Come on, baby, come on!
Good luck, buddy.
Hello, boys! I'm back!
He did it!
The son of a bitch did it!
All right!
What your father did was very brave.
You should be proud of him.
I am.
We know how to take them out, general.
Spread the word.
Get on the wire to every squadron
around the world.
Tell them how to bring
those sons of bitches down.
What do you think?
Checkmate.
Well, it's funny. I always thought
things like these would kill me.
Thank you.
It's been a pleasure.
Steve, you too.
Only one thing left to do.
Ready?
Yes, sir.
Hey, all right! Look at us!
Take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye!
- Y'all take care. Nothing but love for you!
- Goodbye!
Do you think they know
what's about to happen?
Oh, not a chance in hell. Good night!
Peace!
We're loose.
Can you get us out of here in 30 seconds?
I ain't heard no fat lady!
Forget the fat lady.
Drive us out of here!
- They're chasing us.
- Oh, really. You think?
- Oh, that was a hit. I took a hit.
- We're not hit! Stop side-seat driving!
Left, left! Tunnel, tunnel! Exit left!
- Where the hell do you think I'm going?
- Okay, okay. We're...
- They're closing up on us.
- Shut up, shut up!
Go faster, must go faster, must go faster.
Go, go, go, go, go!
Aah!
Oh!
Elvis has left the building!
Thank <i>you very</i> much.
Oh, I love you, man.
They're going down all over the
world, Torn. We got them beat.
How about our two delivery boys?
Any word from them?
We lost contact with Captain Hiller
and Levinson nearly 20 minutes ago.
Hold it!
Hold on, sir. I've got something on radar.
Sorry, sir.
- Good job.
- Thank you.
- Well done, captain.
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
David...
Not bad.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Not too bad at all.
Oh, so this is healthy?
Oh... I could get used to it.
Happy Fourth of July, Daddy.
Same to you, Munchkin.
Didn't I promise you fireworks?
Yeah.
