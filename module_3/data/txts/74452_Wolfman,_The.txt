Show yourself!
I know
you're out there.
Help!
Help me!
Somebody help me!
Help!
Alas! Poor Yorick.
I knew him, Horatio.
A fellow of infinite jest,
of most excellent fancy.
He hath borne me on his back
a thousand times,
and now, how abhorred
in my imagination it is!
My gorge rises at it.
Here hung those lips...
Excuse me.
This is
a private party, miss.
My name is Gwen Conliffe, and I'm engaged to
your brother, Ben.
Is Ben here?
No.
I'm afraid no one knows where Ben is,
which is why I'm here.
Clive.
Well, boys and girls,
let's repair to the tavern!
Good night, sweet prince.
I seem to recall,
Miss Conliffe...
I seem to recall he mentioned you
in one of his letters.
And it's quite uncharacteristic
of my brother
to treat a lady
in such a way,
but the character of man
is such a shiftable thing.
You misapprehend me. Benjamin is missing
from Blackmoor.
He's gone.
Did my father send you?
No, I'm here on my own.
It's been nearly a month
since anyone has seen Ben,
and we knew that
you were in London.
I'd hoped you had
received some word.
Why do you think
he's in trouble?
Because the night he went missing,
two villagers were killed.
Would you help us?
Miss Conliffe,
I am under contract
for the next 30 performances.
If this is about your father,
I know how you feel.
Do you?
My company leaves
for America tomorrow.
I simply can't help.
He is your brother.
Good night.
It must be
a wonderful luxury,
doing battle with
imaginary demons, Mr. Talbot.
Mine right now are very real.
Your mother?
Yes.
My oldest memories
of my mother,
we are gathering grapes
in her father's vineyard.
It is my Garden of Eden.
You're paying yours a visit?
No, my mother died not long
after this was made.
My father and my brother,
they live near Blackmoor.
A man needs
a good stick on the moor.
I purchased this one
in Ge'vaudan lifetimes ago.
It's the work of
a master silversmith.
Would you do me the honor?
It's beautiful.
It will give me
great pleasure to know that
it was the keeping
of a civilized man.
Its heft is somewhat
too much for me these days.
You're overly kind.
But I'm afraid
I must refuse it.
As you wish.
Hello?
Samson!
Lawrence?
Hello, Father.
Ah.
Lo and behold,
the prodigal son returns.
I hope you're not expecting
the fatted calf.
Stay!
We don't have
many visitors.
You seem well.
I've often wondered
what you look like.
You've come about your brother,
have you?
Stay.
Yes.
Miss Conliffe learned
that I was in London...
Samson.
...and sent me
a letter
saying that Ben
has disappeared.
I thought I'd offer my help in
any which way I can.
Yes, what a splendid idea, Lawrence.
A splendid idea.
Too late,
I'm afraid.
Unfortunately,
your brother's body
was found in a ditch by the priory road
yesterday morning.
I assume you have
something to wear for the funeral.
Sir John. You remember
my son, Lawrence?
Singh,
my servant.
Master Lawrence.
It's nice to
see you, Lawrence.
It's good
that you're here.
Has Miss Conliffe
been notified?
Mmm-hmm.
She's upstairs in her bedroom,
asleep.
Where are they
keeping Ben's body?
Your father instructed me
to bury your brother's effects with him.
It seems a shame.
Thank you.
I wouldn't,
sir. It's...
I missed his whole life.
What if it wasn't a beast at all,
but a cunning murderer?
Someone who bore a grudge
against one of these men.
To misdirect the authorities,
he kills the men,
and then he
tears up the bodies
to make it look like a wild beast
was responsible.
Ridiculous! Who would go
to such lengths?
What about that gypsy dancing bear?
It could have done it. That mangy thing?
Kill three men?
I doubt it.
I saw the bodies
with my own eyes.
Unnatural wounds.
Most unnatural.
Made by a fell creature,
I say.
Damn gypsies wandering
the countryside,
bringing their
woe and deviltry with them.
They show up, and two weeks later
this happens!
My guess is Ben Talbot
went to their camp
to have it off
with a gypsy whore.
The bear gets
hold of him,
and they dump what's left of him
in the ditch!
Got nothing to do
with the gypsies.
Twenty-five
years ago now,
me Pa found him.
Quinn Noddy
and all his flock.
Brains and guts
and God-knows-what
Iying all over the moor
for a quarter mile.
And, Quinn,
the look on his face.
Like he'd been
eaten alive.
Whatever did it
was big, had claws,
and didn't mind
a load of buckshot.
After that, me Pa went home
and melted down me Ma's wedding spoons
and cast silver bullets
on them.
Wouldn't leave the house
on a full moon from then on.
He thought it was a werewolf.
I still say
that bear's to blame.
You'd think the Talbots
would've learned their lesson, eh?
Consorting with the Romas.
Right. Remember that black-eyed Salome
the old man married?
Went crazy up there
in the ward, killed herself.
She was a gypo whore queen
or some such, wasn't she?
Yes.
She was crazy
for coming to this
shithole you call a town.
What did he say?
You're in your drink, boy.
Get him out of my tavern, Nye!
Come on, lad.
If you want to do
something about it,
I'll be outside.
My mother wasn't a whore.
Lawrence Talbot?
Good evening.
Please join us. It's good to see you
up and about.
Refreshed, recovered
and as enchanting as ever.
Please, join us.
Good evening, Miss Conliffe.
Good evening.
What a pleasant surprise.
May I recommend
the baked eel?
Singh has outdone himself this evening,
haven't you, Singh?
Something plainer.
Thank you.
I was a moment ago
telling my son
that the telegraph system
does reach us here in lonely old Blackmoor.
Do you find your home
much changed, Mr. Talbot?
Blackmoor does seem
rather the same as I left it.
How so?
The villagers, they still have
the same wild ideas.
Yes, well, they're a provincial lot,
I must say,
ignorant and superstitious
to a worldly man such as yourself.
We're savages
at the ends of the earth.
I didn't intend
to start a squabble.
All I'm saying is that
you dismiss the natural man at your peril.
That's all.
I find your insecurities
quite strange, Father.
No, you mistake that
for my self-awareness.
And how comfortable
are you in your skin, may I ask?
One can get
used to anything.
Excuse me.
You know, Lawrence, I've never understood
what it is that you do,
pretending to be
other people.
But I understand you're highly celebrated
and famous for it.
Perhaps one day I'll see for myself
what all the fuss is about.
I think your mother
would've liked that.
She loved you and your brother
with all her heart.
Why did she do it?
She struggled with life,
as we all do.
She lost.
Does that answer
your question?
I saw Ben's body today.
What kind of animal
could have done such a thing?
I've seen the work of a Kodiak bear
and a Bengal tiger,
nature at its most vicious,
but I must say, I've never seen
anything like this.
People in town say
it was a man.
You mean a raving lunatic
at loose on the moor?
Yes, it's possible, but I think I would have
run him down with my dogs.
On the other hand,
the wounds are so terrible
that only something human
would seem capable
of such wanton malevolence.
I found a strange medallion
among Ben's belongings.
Yes, Saint Columbanus.
He was an Eastern saint.
He was also a gypsy.
So did Ben have dealings
with the gypsies?
Yes, he was our negotiator.
The local gentry
would pay a fee,
and the gypsies would keep
their criminal activities to a minimum.
And they would move on
once they'd sold
the local lads all the wine
and dark-haired ladies
they could stand.
"That orbe'd maiden with white fire laden,
Whom mortals call the moon,
"Glides glimmering o'er
my fleece-like floor..."
"By the midnight
breezes strewn."
She exerts enormous power,
doesn't she?
I wish things were different.
Never look back, Lawrence.
Never look back.
The past is
a wilderness of horrors.
Lawrence,
I'm glad you're home.
Can I help you, sir?
I was hoping to have a word
with Miss Conliffe.
Just a moment, sir.
Miss Conliffe.
My behavior was unacceptable.
These were Ben's.
He'd want you
to have them.
If there's anything you need,
anything at all, please let me know.
I want to know
what happened to him.
I'll do everything I can.
Thank you.
Thank you for coming.
Mother!
Mother!
Lawrence.
Lawrence, wake up.
I heard something.
Lawrence.
Lawrence, I'm scared.
Go back to bed.
Mother?
Mother!
Hello.
Hello.
Ben said that you played here
as children.
It was our refuge.
From what?
You mean from whom.
Your father,
he has a way
with being distant.
Ben told me it was because I reminded him
of your mother.
He said you did,
as well.
Which is why he put me in an asylum
for a whole year,
then shipped me off
to my aunt in America.
You sure you won't
stay one more night?
My father has
lodgings at the inn,
and that's more convenient
for the train, so...
When do you
return to London?
Not till I find out
what happened to my brother.
Lawrence, that's all
well and good,
but I think your inquiry
could wait until tomorrow.
The moon is full tonight,
and I'd prefer that you stay inside
in the event that your raving lunatic
theory is correct.
I don't want
to lose you, too.
Take your horse, sir?
Good evening.
He says you must stay in the camp.
The woods are not safe.
Ask him
if he knows anyone
who sells these.
BOY: You want to
talk to Maleva.
To who?
Maleva.
It was found on
my brother's body.
Your caravan shows up,
three men are killed.
I don't think
it's a coincidence.
There is
no coincidence.
Only fate.
But she plays
a hidden hand.
Tell me about my brother.
MAN: Run
round the back!
Give us the bloody bear,
you old snake handler.
We know what's
been going on.
Nonsense.
He dances, that's all.
Come on! Get off!
What's going on here?
We've come
for the bear, Nye.
It done
all the killing.
For goodness' sake!
He's harmless.
What happened?
It's the Devil!
The Devil!
Mama! Mama!
Maria!
Maria! Where are you, Maria?
Maria!
Over there!
Maria!
Maria!
Mama!
Mama!
My baby.
Take the girl.
Stay in the camp.
LAWRENCE: Boy!
Boy!
Go back, get help!
Get Maleva!
Once he is
bitten by the beast, there is no cure.
You should let him die.
You would
make me a sinner.
There is no sin
in killing a beast.
Is there not?
Sometimes the way of fate
is a cruel one.
He can only be released
by someone who loves him.
Whoa!
Lawrence.
Holy Mother of God.
Help me
with him, Singh.
"Do thou but thine
and be not diffident of wisdom
"She deserts thee not
if thou dismiss not her"
Is everything all right?
Lawrence?
Get Dr. Lloyd.
Are you all right?
Yes, I feel better.
I thought
you were leaving.
Well, this place is
impossible to escape.
Besides, it's the least
I could do.
What did
the gypsies say?
Some nonsense about the Devil
being at Blackmoor.
It's remarkable.
A week ago, I would have said you'd never
use that arm again.
And now?
It seems to have
healed itself.
I'll be back to check on you
at the end of the week.
Thank you, Doctor.
Miss Conliffe.
Yes?
I want to thank you.
For?
For prolonging your stay here at Blackmoor with us
during this difficult time.
Had there been some sense
of filial obedience,
well, you would not have been
inconvenienced.
Well, Lawrence was trying to find out
what happened to Ben.
And now we know
it's still out there.
Nevertheless,
I thank you.
Not at all.
You should be
asleep, Lawrence.
So should you.
Is there anything
I can get for you?
Are you
expecting a war?
A Sikh is a warrior of God.
He must always arm himself against evil.
Do you believe
in curses?
This house has seen more than its share
of suffering.
Your mother. Your brother.
Yes, I believe in curses.
How could you stand it here
all these years?
You didn't have
to stay.
Silver.
I didn't know
you hunted monsters.
Sometimes monsters
hunt you.
Yes, he's been quite seriously
injured, lnspector,
and he's suffering
from a loss of memory.
I don't think he could be of any
use to you now.
Well, I think,
at some point,
he is going to want to
talk about...
No.
I do understand.
Only if I could have
just a few words with him.
No. A completely
unofficial interview.
Even the briefest exchange
could be infinitely helpful to me.
Francis Aberline,
Scotland Yard.
Honored to meet you,
Mr. Talbot. I'm a huge admirer.
I'm sorry to hear
of your troubles.
I do hope they won't
impede your return to the stage.
Thank you.
Shall we?
Please.
It was an animal.
You're quite sure?
What else
could it have been?
There are other witnesses, no doubt, that had
a better look than I did.
Well...
Not too good a look,
I'm afraid.
None of the locals
survived to tell of it,
and the gypsies only talk of demons
and devils.
I understood your injury
was quite savage.
Yes.
I hope you don't
find this prurient,
but would it be
possible for me
to arrange for a specialist
to examine you?
It's amazing what we can
discern by scientific means these days.
And at your convenience,
of course.
Of course.
No, a great mystery,
it is,
given that there are no natural predators
left in England
capable of inflicting
such horrific injuries.
Well, the savagery of the attack would suggest
the action of an animal.
Or a lunatic, perhaps.
Someone with a history
of mental disturbance,
who'd spent time
inside an asylum
and who may have suffered injuries at
the hands of his victims.
I get
your implication
and resent it.
You're clearly aware
of my personal history,
as I believe
I am aware of yours.
Weren't you in charge of the Ripper case
a couple of years back?
Well, you're a direct man,
so I'll be equally direct with you.
I'm not your enemy,
Mr. Talbot.
But you've been seen as Hamlet, Macbeth,
Richard III,
all with that same face.
Now a prudent man would ask who else might
be living inside that head of yours.
Good day, lnspector.
So you won't mind
if I establish your whereabouts
on the nights in question?
Feel free.
Good day, Mr. Talbot.
I'll be sending my specialists
to examine you
at your convenience,
of course.
Lawrence?
Yeah.
You all right?
Yes.
What did
the lnspector say?
Well, he asked
a lot of questions.
I'm sorry. I feel so responsible
for what's happened to you.
If I hadn't sent that letter,
you'd be back in New York.
No. No. It was right
that I came back.
You mustn't feel like that.
No.
Try it.
Well, I can't make it skip like you.
You have to flick it.
May l?
Yes.
When you throw it,
turn your wrist up and whip it.
Wrist up and whip it.
And make sure
you swing your hips.
What's it like
in New York?
Did you hear that?
What?
Horses.
Hello, Doctor. I thought our appointment
wasn't till Friday.
Come with us. It's nearly the full moon.
You were bitten by the beast.
You bear his mark now.
Mr. Talbot.
There are many of us here who are looking for
a natural explanation.
Help us.
Come on, Talbot.
Show us your wound.
We are told it heals
in an unnatural way.
Get your hands
off of me.
Will you let him murder
your wives and children?
MONTFORD: My eyes!
Damn you, Talbot!
Sorry, Colonel.
I meant to shoot you.
Sadly, I'm not the marksman I used to be.
I must be getting old.
He's cursed. God
has forsaken him.
Let us deal
with him.
You know you're
trespassing on my land,
and I could shoot you
on the spot right now.
My Sikh manservant,
he's on the roof,
and he happens to be a crack shot
with a repeating rifle.
And he will kill you.
He'll kill the next eight of you
before he has to reload,
so please take yourself
off my land.
And if I see any of you
trespassing this way again,
I won't be so civil,
if you take my meaning.
Good day to you,
Colonel.
Lawrence.
You're bleeding.
How could they possibly think he's
a threat to them?
Well, he's a stranger here in Blackmoor,
Miss Conliffe,
and that makes him
very dangerous.
Thank you.
Yes. You can also thank Singh when he
returns from the village.
You're not the only one
in the family who can act.
Samson!
Let's get something
to clean that.
Did they hurt
your shoulder?
No.
On the contrary, it feels much stronger
than before.
That's good.
I was able
to hold them...
All three of them back.
You know, you mustn't
listen to them. The villagers.
They're backward
and foolish.
Everything I hate
about this place.
This might sting a bit.
Lawrence.
Excuse me.
What's happened?
You have to leave.
Please pack
your things.
Did I do something?
It's not safe here.
You must return
to London tonight.
I'll be out here waiting.
Lawrence, wait.
What are you afraid of?
If anything
ever happened to you,
I'd never forgive myself.
There are those who doubt
the power of Satan.
The power of Satan
to change men into beasts!
But the ancient pagans
did not doubt.
Nor did the prophets.
Did not Daniel warn Nebuchadnezzar?
But the proud king
did not heed Daniel.
And so, as the Bible says, "He was made as unto a wolf
and cast out from men."
A beast has come among us.
But God will defend
his faithful.
With his right hand,
he will smite the foul demon.
I say to you, the enemy's ploy
is a devious one.
Twisting the accursed into beasts, he seeks
to bring us low.
Make us as animals.
Teach us self-loathing,
so we forget that we are made in the image
of Almighty God himself!
Samson.
Why does our Lord
tolerate this mockery?
"Pride goeth
before destruction,
"a haughty spirit
before the fall. "
I say it is because
we have sinned against him.
Because our crimes reek to heaven,
and they demand vengeance.
Pint of bitter,
please.
Mrs. Kirk.
Why aren't you out with MacQueen,
trying to catch that thing
what killed my husband?
As I don't know where
the lunatic will strike,
it seems the practical thing to do is
to stay as near as possible
to the potential victims.
And seeing that 214 of the 309 residents
of Blackmoor and its environs
Iive within, what,
500 yards of this tavern,
I was planning
to spend the evening here.
Not Talbot Hall?
Why would you say that?
They're cursed,
all of them.
Unfortunately, "cursed"
does not give me a warrant
to wander about
Sir John's estate at night.
Rules, Mrs. Kirk.
They're all that keep us
from a dog-eat-dog world, you know.
Pint of bitter, please.
Lawrence,
Miss Conliffe
has left Blackmoor.
Yes, I sent her away.
She's probably
in London by now.
Why would you
do that, Lawrence?
Because this place is cursed.
Father.
It is a shrine
to your beloved mother.
She was truly
a beautiful woman.
I know that losing her
wounded you deeply.
And it is monstrous, a young boy seeing
his mother like that.
And I would have
given my life, Lawrence,
that you hadn't
found us that night.
You must believe me
when I tell you this, Lawrence.
You do believe me,
don't you?
I loved your mother with a passion like
the burning of the sun.
Her death finished me.
I was devastated.
I still prowl the house
at night,
searching for her.
I'm dead all the same.
Look into
my eyes, Lawrence.
You see,
I'm quite dead.
My dear fellow,
I wish I could tell you
that the tragedy
that has beset your life was over.
But I'm afraid the darkest hours of hell
lie before you.
I don't think they'll
kill you, Lawrence,
but they will blame you.
The beast
will have its day.
The beast will out.
We've got him, men!
We got him!
Mind the pit, Johnny!
Johnny?
Help me get out!
Shoot it! Shoot him!
Johnny!
Johnny?
MacQueen!
Lawrence.
Lawrence.
Lawrence!
Wake up.
Lawrence.
Terrible things,
Lawrence.
You've done
terrible things.
Hold your fire!
We want him alive!
Get down!
On your knees!
Ah, tis as you said,
lnspector.
It is as you said.
I'm sorry, Sir John.
Be strong, Lawrence.
Be strong.
Where is my father?
I am sorry to see you
back here with us, Lawrence.
You disappoint me.
But we have made
enormous strides
in the treatment of delusions
such as yours.
Where is my father?
Bracing, is it,
guv'ner?
Where's my father?
Where's my father?
Where is my father?
I said if you don't kill my father,
he will kill again and again
and again and again.
"Prithee, Horatio,
tell me one thing.
"Dost thou think Alexander
looked o' this fashion
i' the earth?
"And smelt so?
And smelt so?"
I hope this won't impede
your return to the stage.
Alas, poor Yorick!
Lawrence, wake up.
I heard something.
Terrible things,
Lawrence.
Terrible things.
Father!
Look into my eyes, Lawrence.
You see, I'm quite dead.
GWEN: It's all right,
Lawrence.
Everything's all right.
I'm going to take you home.
Come with me.
It's all right.
Come on.
It's all right.
Hold me.
Just hold me.
Shh.
It's not real.
It's not real.
Lycanthropy.
Yeah, lycanthropy.
I contracted the disease, if that's what it is,
in lndia in the Hindu Kush.
The natives directed me to a cave
high up in the mountains,
where, according to legend, lived a strange
creature. A very strange creature.
And after a great many days
of climbing and searching,
finally, I came
upon it. I found it.
I found the cave,
and the strange creature
that lived there.
It was a little boy,
a little wild feral boy,
powerfully strong,
who suddenly
attacked me and bit me.
So I returned to my hunting companions
in the valley below
thinking I'd been
made the butt of a joke.
I soon discovered
otherwise.
You killed my mother.
Yeah, I suppose I did.
You should kill yourself.
Oh, I cannot tell you
how often I've considered that.
But life is
far too glorious,
Lawrence,
especially to the cursed
and the damned
Iike myself.
Yeah.
Every night of the full moon,
for many years,
I've been locked away
in that crypt
by Singh, my faithful servant.
Twenty-five years.
Then she came, didn't she?
Hot and burning like the face of the moon.
Gwen?
Yeah, she would have taken
your brother away from me,
and they would have both
vanished into the night
forever.
And although I was resigned to it,
the beast in me was not.
And, Ben, you understand,
had come to tell me
that he was quite resolute in his decision
to leave Talbot Hall for good
and to take Gwen
away from me.
I became drunk and violent,
and extremely violent.
And I struck out at Singh, who was
trying to restrain me,
and I knocked
him out cold.
Poor...
Poor old Singh.
Yeah.
You know, I never
told you this, Lawrence,
but I used to be
a bare-knuckle prize fighter
when I was a young man
in the ports of Boston,
San Francisco, New York.
Back in the good old days,
before you were born.
Long time ago.
Bam!
Yeah.
Anyway, as a consequence, I was unable to
lock myself in the crypt that night.
And I found your brother's body
in a ditch
not far from the house.
He'd been torn to pieces.
I know now it was a mistake
to lock up the beast.
Don't you think so,
Lawrence?
I should have
let it run free.
Kill or be killed.
I'll kill you!
You have a long way to go
yet, my young pup.
I'll kill you.
Oh your chance is coming
soon enough.
She'll be full tonight,
the moon.
I have a small gift
for you, Lawrence,
in the event
you don't find life
as glorious as
I find it to be.
Or not to be.
I'm deeply sorry about this, Lawrence.
I do love you, dear boy.
You may find that
hard to believe,
in the light
of what has happened.
I'll kill you.
Sleep now.
I'll kill you.
Rest.
Guard?
I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!
I attempted to remove
these mental fabrications,
but now, 25 years later, I find that young
Lawrence's harmless hallucinations
have manifested themselves
into delusions of a horrific nature.
Ah!
Mr. Talbot.
We are here tonight
to illustrate conclusively
that Mr. Talbot's fears
are quite irrational.
So we will remain
in this room together,
and once Mr. Talbot
has witnessed
that the full moon
holds no sway over him,
that he remains a perfectly ordinary
human being,
he will have taken
his first small step
down the long road
to mental recovery.
Now, we are all aware
that Mr. Talbot
has suffered quite traumatic
personal experiences.
He witnessed his mother's
self-mutilations.
His young mind, unable to accept it,
created a fantastical truth,
that his father is to blame.
That his father
is literally
a monster.
But your father
is not a werewolf.
You were not bitten
by a werewolf.
You will not become
a werewolf
any more than I will sprout wings
and fly out of that window.
Please, please,
help me.
I think that Mr. Talbot
has something to say to us.
Stop it.
Speak up, Mr. Talbot.
Forgive me,
but we can't hear you.
You moron.
Tonight, I will kill
all of you!
I will kill
all of you!
Yes, well, as you
can see, lycanthropy
Please do something about it!
is a disease of the mind
existing somewhere in the deep recesses
Kill me.
Kill me!
of Mr. Talbot's thoughts.
To him, it seems very real.
The subject before you has,
for the past month,
undergone both pharmaceutical
and physical desensitizing
in order to reduce
the nervous exaggerations.
Dr. Hoenegger?
This malady derives from...
Doctor!
Doctor!
Let me pass!
For God's sake,
hurry up!
Open...
Open this door!
It seems to be
locked, sir.
Idiot! Open it!
Smash open this door!
Help me!
Davis?
Yes, sir?
Are you armed?
Yes, sir.
Give me your revolver!
Quickly!
Pardon me. Excuse me.
As you were.
Carter!
Sir.
Have you got a pistol?
Yes, sir.
Follow me.
Telegraph the Yard.
Issue weapons.
All right, sir.
Now!
Right away, sir!
I don't suppose
we have any silver bullets.
What?
Clear the street!
Oh, my God!
You two, with me.
Steady.
God help us.
Up ahead!
Start
checking the docks!
Who's there?
Lawrence?
What are you
doing here?
What have they done
to you?
I am what they say I am.
I'm a monster.
And so is my father.
He killed Ben.
And my mother, too.
I can help you.
There's no help for me.
If such things exist,
if they are possible,
then everything is.
Magic.
And God.
I can find a way to stop it.
I must confess,
I envy my brother for the days
he had with you.
What joy
he must have felt.
I would have given
anything I own
to have known you
in another life.
I must get back to Talbot Hall
and end this.
Lawrence.
Please let me help you.
You already have.
Lawrence, don't.
Just stay here with me.
Stay here with me!
Miss Conliffe,
good morning.
Inspector.
May I impose?
I must ask you directly,
have you seen Lawrence Talbot?
I'm sure by now you've heard
of his escape.
Yes, I've heard. And, no, I haven't
seen him.
Miss Conliffe, I cannot stress to you enough
the mortal peril you're in
should you find yourself
in his presence.
Thank you.
I'll be careful.
Miss Conliffe, I admire your
noble intentions.
You think you can save him,
but you can't.
I must insist
you come with me.
Insist? He's not...
Carter!
He's not here,
lnspector!
Take your hand
off me.
Come on!
Take your hand off me!
Come on now, woman!
Talbot?
Raise your arms and step out
where I can see you.
Talbot?
No!
Come now! Come along!
Now there's some
bad luck for you.
Globe! Globe! Lawrence Talbot
is still missing!
Police scour London!
Globe! Globe!
Lawrence Talbot
is still missing!
Police scour London!
Lawrence Talbot
is still missing!
Police scour London!
I'm looking for a woman called Maleva.
Do you know her?
Thank you.
Psst.
What is it
you want from me?
Lawrence Talbot.
You know what happened to him.
You understand it.
Listen to me.
I need you to help me.
Leave him to his fate.
I have to save him.
Do you love him?
Just tell me what to do.
Will you condemn him?
Or will you
set him free?
Do you know
what that means?
Yes.
But I can't. I can't do that.
He's still there.
I know he is.
I know I can save him.
I'm begging you,
tell me what to do.
There is no cure.
You are risking your life.
May the saints protect you
and give you strength to do what you must.
DRlVER: Whoa! Whoa, there!
You're sure
he'll come?
Yeah, quite sure.
Right.
Take the priory road.
Railway station.
South garden
to the river.
Tell Sir John
we're here,
and then stay
close to the estate,
but not too close.
If you see Talbot,
don't get caught
in a conversation.
Shoot him
and kill him.
On sight!
Carter hasn't reported.
He's not at his post
in front of the house.
Miss Conliffe?
Wait!
Get the others.
Samson.
"l will arise and
go to my father,
"and I will say unto him, Father,
I have sinned against heaven and before thee.
"'l am no more worthy
to be called thy son."'
And lo and behold, there he stands.
The prodigal son.
For he is returned.
Shall I have my own robe
brought to be placed upon your shoulders?
Rings for your fingers?
Shoes for your feet?
What you should do
is pray,
but we both know it wouldn't do
any good.
Are those Singh's silver bullets
in my gun?
I'm sorry.
You have me
at a disadvantage.
It makes me happy.
What does?
Seeing you here
like this.
My son returned.
It is glorious, isn't it?
No. It's hell.
Hell?
No. The beast
is the beast.
Let it run free.
Poor little Lawrence.
You were the fragile one.
I removed the powder
from those shells many, many years ago.
But I confess,
I was quite overwhelmed
by your enormous courage.
Finally, you're the man
I always wanted you to be.
Lawrence! My boy.
Here.
Do you see her,
Lawrence?
Do you feel her presence?
Her power?
She'll be here soon.
Coming from
darkness into light.
You're heir to
my kingdom, Lawrence.
You've always
been heir to my kingdom.
Lawrence.
Lawrence!
No!
Run! Run!
Are you sure
you're all right, sir?
Go on.
Look at me, Lawrence.
You know me.
You know who I am.
Don't.
You know who I am!
Lawrence! Don't.
Look at me.
Lawrence, you know me.
You know me,
remember me, look at me.
It's Gwen.
Lawrence, it's Gwen. Please.
No!
Gwen...
I'm sorry.
It had to be this way.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
It is said there is no sin
in killing a beast,
only in killing a man.
But where does one begin
and the other end?
