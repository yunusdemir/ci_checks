<b><font face="Arial Narrow">You weren't followed?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">No.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Better come in.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Trust no one, Jim.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Especially not in the mainstream.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Sit down.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I understand you still have one
Hungarian identity running?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I do.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I want you to go to Budapest.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">This is not above board.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Nobody else knows.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">They're after my head, Jim boy.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Do you understand?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I have had an offer of service.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">A Hungarian general wants to come over.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I would like you to meet him.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">He has some information that I need, Jim.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">What information?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Treasure.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">He has the name of the mole</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">the Russians have planted in
the British intelligence service</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">right at the top of the Circus.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">There's a rotten apple, Jim.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">We have to find it.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Stop!</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Would you witness this for me?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I wish I could done more, Control.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">You did all you could, Percy.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Well, a man should know
when to leave the party.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">What about Smiley?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Smiley is leaving with me.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">You little prick, Esterhase.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Gentlemen, shall we start?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Undersecretary Lacon is
ready for you, Sir Percy.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">The Treasury don't understand.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Why can't the intelligence service
simply put in a request</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">for a general increase in funding</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">and then you account for the spend
on your special operation?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Operation Witchcraft needs to remain secret.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- It's a fiefdom of its own.
- Yes, that's what's worrying us.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">The whole thing's very
unaccountable, isn't it?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">And this London house that nobody
knows the address of,</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">is that really necessary?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Now more than ever. We need
to protect our Soviet source.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">So where do you propose we meet?
In a caf√©?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">The rent and rates on this house have doubled.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">We spent millions on nuclear warheads.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">We're asking for a few thousand for a house.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I wonder if Karla has the same problem</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">with the Treasury at the Kremlin.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Look, nobody underestimates</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">the importance of the job
you chaps are doing.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">But what happened in Budapest last year,</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">that was a disaster.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">With respect, sir,</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">it wasn't one of your civil servants
that got killed, was it?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Now this isn't about soldiers
in trenches any more.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- We're the front line now...
- Roy!</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">For 25 years we've been the only thing
standing between them and Karla</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">and Moscow and the third bloody world war.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Look, the Minister's very pleased
with your progress so far.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">He's less pleased, though,</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">with the lack of progress
with our American cousins.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">You see,</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">in their eyes,</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">you're still a leaky ship.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Yes?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Someone on the line for you, sir.
Seems urgent.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Alright, well put him through.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Hello?
- Is this Undersecretary Lacon?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Yes.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">My name's Ricki Tarr.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- What do you want?
- I need to meet you.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">If you need to confirm who I am, you
can talk to my boss at the Circus,</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Peter Guillam.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">But only Guillam, no one else.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">You got clearance for that?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Well, I'm not bloody chaining it up outside.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Mind you, no better off in here with
this bunch of bloody cut-throats.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">They'd have the gold out of your teeth.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Thought I'd pop in and catch a glimpse
of the new girl before Bland gets to her.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Ah, yes. Belinda the blonde.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Has he seen her yet?
- Of course he has.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Came down first thing this morning.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Belinda.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Peter Guillam.
- Hello, Peter, this is Oliver.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Just ringing to find out...</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">So Winston Churchill
saved your life, Edie.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I was working in the kitchen,
getting dinner ready.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">And he was late, you see.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- During a raid?
- During a raid, you see.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">He said, <i>Why aren't you in that shelter?</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Why weren't you?
- Well, because...</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I was sorry to hear about Control, Mr Smiley.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">He said Tarr called him from a phone box.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">He said there's a mole,</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">right at the top of the Circus,</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">that he's been there for years.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">It does mean</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">you're rather well placed to look
into this matter for us now,</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">doesn't it?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Outside the family.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I'm retired, Oliver.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">You fired me.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">The thing is,</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">some time ago before Control died,</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">he came to me with a similar suggestion.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">That there is a mole.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">He never mentioned his suspicions to you?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">No.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Oh, I just thought that as you
were his man, so to speak...</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">What did you say to him?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I'm afraid I thought his paranoia had
rather gotten the better of him</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">and he was going to pull
his whole house down.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">That bloody mess in Budapest.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Damn it, George.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">It's your generation, your legacy.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I would have thought, if there's
any truth in it, you'd want to...</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I'll keep Peter.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">And there's a retired Special Branch man,
Mendel.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I should like to have him.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Lift up.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">And quickly down again.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">There's a place I know, sir. A little hotel
near Liverpool Street.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Be careful with it. Please.
It's Georgian.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">My friend wants peace and quiet in
order to work, Mrs Pope Graham.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">No disturbances.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Her real name is just Graham.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Added the Pope for a touch of class.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Peter, did you get the keys to Control's flat?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>And did those feet in ancient time</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>Walk upon England's mountains green</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Oh!</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">George!</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">George, get in here!</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">George.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Sit down.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Take a look at this nonsense.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Report by Soviet high command</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">on their recent naval exercises
in the Black Sea.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Just what the admiralty has been begging us</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">for some information on.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Where did you get this?
- I didn't.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Percy and his little cabal
walked in with it.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Look, Control...
- Shut up.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Style appalling.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Patently a fabrication
from beginning to end.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Just could be the real thing.
- Well, if it's genuine, it's gold dust.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">But its topicality makes it suspect.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Smiley is suspicious, Percy.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Where did it come from? What's the access?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">A new secret source of mine.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">But how could he possibly have access?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">He has access to the most sensitive levels
of policy-making.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">We've named the operation Witchcraft.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Oh, Percy and his pals bypassed us, Smiley.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Gone straight to the minister.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Percy has been allowed to keep
the identity of his new friend</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">top secret.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">The minister agrees too many secrets
are blown around here.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Too much failure, too many scandals.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Too little solid intelligence.
- Percy does have a point, Control.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">We should be fighting Communism,
not each other.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Meanwhile we're losing our reputation,
our partners.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Your bloody Yanks!</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">We've had enough! There's going to be changes.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">We need to decide if want to be part
of the past or part of the future.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I should have left you where I found you.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Look!
- Control...</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Out, all of you!</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">If Witchcraft is genuine...</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Nothing is genuine any more.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">George...</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Do you want me to get this stuff
over to the hotel?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Thank you. Anywhere will do.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Peter?
- Hmm?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I need you to do something for me.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I'd like you to go to the Circus.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">In the cabinet at the duty officers' station</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">are records of staff recently retired.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I'd like photographs of them</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">and of the diagram of the Circus's re-organization
under Percy Alleline,</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">along with a list of all payments made
from the Reptile fund.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Help you with anything, Bill?
- I was just looking for his Majesty.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Well, he's out walking the battlements.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Oh.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Heard you had an accident, Peter.
- Yeah, I cut my hand open on a drawer.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">When are you going to get some
new furniture up here?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I'll have a word with Esterhase. We'll
make it a priority on the top floor.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Where are you off to?
- Lunch.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Want some company?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">According to the personnel files,</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">seven were due for retirement anyway.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Another four don't seem
particularly mysterious.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Jerry Westerby was dismissed December 4.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Connie Sachs retired November 28.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">That's just two weeks after you and Control
were forced out.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Return to Oxford, please.
- That's ¬£1.15.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Percy has always resisted any proposal</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">of a wider exploitation of
Witchcraft's intelligence.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Drop the bloody jargon, Lacon.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I've refused to share Witchcraft
with our allies so far, Minister.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Greedy boy.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">My goal has been to establish its
track record beyond all doubt.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I think the time has come to approach
our American brothers-in-arms.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Will they take us back into bed?
- I'm not interested in a one-off trade.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I want ongoing access to
American intelligence.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">You think we can get it?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">With Witchcraft on our side, we can
get anything we bloody well want.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Fine.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Carry on.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Thank you.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">And I strike thee down...</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Oh, I, uh...</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Not supposed to. Doctor's orders.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Wicked, wicked George.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I don't know about you, George,</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">but I feel seriously under-fucked.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I heard Ann left you again.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">She doesn't deserve you, George,
not one hair on your head.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">You left the Circus shortly after I retired.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I didn't leave. I was dismissed.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Chucked out on the rubbish heap, like you.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Why?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Polyakov.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Do you remember him?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">From the Soviet Embassy?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Alexsey Polyakov, cultural attach√©
here in London.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">When he arrived here 15 years ago,
I requested he be checked out.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">He was graded whiter than white.
Didn't put a foot wrong.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">But you disagreed?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">There's a story you must have heard</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">that Karla has set up a secret cell.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">The personnel are all ex-military,</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">trained to handle deep-penetration agents,
moles.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">There are always stories, Connie.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">But what if this story was true?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">One night in research I
saw something, George.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">There was our friend Polyakov
at a May day parade in Berlin</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">receiving a salute.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Why would you salute a cultural attach√©?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Exactly. Unless he was
a war veteran himself.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">And if he was, why hide the fact?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">What did you do?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I went straight to Esterhase and Alleline.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Here.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Polyakov is a Karla-trained hood
if ever I saw one.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">If he's here, it must be because
he's running a mole.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">You're to leave Polyakov alone.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">You're becoming obsessed with him.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- You're losing your sense of proportion.
- But that's ridiculous.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Perhaps it's time you went out
into the real world.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">What does it matter? Old Circus
is gone anyway.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Here we are.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">The Nursery in our day.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Jim Prideaux.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">And Bill Haydon. Together, of course.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">The Inseparables.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">There's Control himself.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">All my boys.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">All my lovely boys.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">That was a good time, George.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">It was the war, Connie.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">A real war.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Englishmen could be proud then.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">So I was right, then?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">About Polyakov.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">There is a mole.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">If it's bad, don't come back. I want
to remember you all as you were.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Percy? Percy, did you mix this?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Aye, I did so.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">You Calvinistic, penny-pinching Scot.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Can you nae learn to take a bloody order?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Nobody tampers with the recipe!</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- I followed the recipe.
- Come on.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">It'll take us five hours to get
drunk on this monkey's piss.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>He's not the first</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- <i> He's not the first</i>
- Oh, well.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- <i> He's the second best secret agent</i>
- Merry Christmas.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>In the whole wide world</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>He's not number one</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>But not the worst</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>He's just the second best secret agent</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>In the whole wide world</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>He's every bit</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>As good as what's-his-name</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>With a dame</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>Any dame</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>And all those bullet holes are in his vest</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>To prove you work a little harder</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>When you're second best...</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Courtesy of Mrs P.
- Hmm?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">You been up all night?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Yes.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">What's this?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Request for ¬£1,000 in cash
from the Reptile fund.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">To a Mr Ellis.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">It was one of Jim Prideaux's work names.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Prideaux was killed in Hungary a year ago.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">October 21.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">So why was someone giving him
¬£1,000 two months later?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I wonder where he is then, sir.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Settle down now.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Hand those out.
- Sir.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">What is it? The Hunchback of Notre-Dame?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">The bells, the bells!</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Ohh!</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Come here.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- What's your name?
- Roach. Bill Roach, sir.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- I'm a new boy.
- New arrival, eh?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- What's the story?
- My mother and father.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">My father left, so...</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Hmm.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Bill.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">The unpaid Bill.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Anyone ever call you that?
- No, sir.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Known a lot of Bills in my time.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">They've all been good 'uns.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">What are you good at?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Nothing, sir.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">You're a good watcher, though, eh?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Us loners always are.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Best watcher in the unit,
Bill Roach is, I'll bet.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Long as he's got his specs on. Right?
- Yes, sir.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">This is good, very good.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Hello, Ricki.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">You've missed the wedge.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Where have you been, Ricki?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">They're going to kill me.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Who is?
- Your lot.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Or their lot. Whoever gets me first.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I'm innocent.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Within reason.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">How long have you been here?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Sorry, I've run out of places now.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I needed to see you.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Why?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">There's a woman.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I need you to trade for her. I need you
to get her back off Karla.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">A woman?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Her name's Irina.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">This was last November.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Mr Guillam sent me to Istanbul to check out
a Russian trade delegate</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">who might be persuaded to defect.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Tufty Thesinger, resident.
- Yeah.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Hiya, Ricki.
- Alright, mate?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Did you know him?
- No, never met him.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Bit of a drinker.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Hangover from hell.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Bit of a fucking idiot.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Apparently this Russian, name of Boris,</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">was spending high and
wide in the nightclubs.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">So you were sent to persuade this Boris?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Yeah. He was your typical Russian.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Trade delegation by day,
out boozing every night.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Didn't seem to sleep.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Tufty was worn out from
following him around.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I think it's going to be
a long night, son.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">His favorite haunt was
this club in Taksim.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">It had a hellhole in the basement where
the sailors and the tourists went.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Anyway, I took one look at him and I knew
I'd wasted a journey.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Boris was no delegate.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">What delegate bothers to play drunker
than he really is?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">You get to recognize your own,
don't you, Mr Smiley?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">And Boris was a hood.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Moscow Center trained.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>Someone is waiting</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>I mean just for you</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>Spinning wheel</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>Keep on spinning through,
Drop all your troubles...</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I guessed he was waiting for a connect.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Working a letterbox, maybe, or...</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">trailing his coat and looking for a pass
from some mug like me.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">So the second night I went
to the import/export outfit</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">that Tufty had set up with a cipher room
hidden in the back.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I cabled <i>No sale</i> to Mr Guillam.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">And that was that.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">You were due to fly home the next day.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Yes.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">But you didn't.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Boris had a wife.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Common-law.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Apparently she was a member of the delegation
in her own right.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">You once told me to trust my instincts
about women, Mr Smiley.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Well, my instincts told me this woman
had some treasure.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">When Boris went out for the night,
I found myself going into her hotel.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">So you dropped Boris.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I know. It was breaking protocol.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">But I was acting on my own initiative,
as it were.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Your man's a bit of a bastard, isn't he?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I just wanted to make sure
you were alright, OK?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">So you didn't come home?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I would have.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Boris was a dead end, but...</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Uhm...</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I could...</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I could sense something in her.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">A secret.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">And how did you intend to
get this secret out of her?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I played this businessman, Michael Trench.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Holiday romance.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I thought I'd take my time with it.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I know who you are.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I want to talk to your boss.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Control.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I have something to trade.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Something big.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I want a new life in the West.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">That's the deal.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">You tell them.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Look, you can't expect them to
jump at every offer of service.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">If you won't tell me more,
there is nothing I can do.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">If I tell you everything,</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I'm putting my life in your hands.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">And the lives of other people.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">So she told me what she had to trade.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Her secret.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I mean,</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">the mother of all secrets.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I told her I'd alert the Circus.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">She made me promise I wouldn't give
any of the details to London.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- And you agreed?
- Yes.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I mean it was...</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I couldn't believe I'd got hold
of something this big.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I went back to the import/export,</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">sent the message to the Circus, graded,
<i>Flash, highest priority</i>,</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">just that I had a Moscow-trained hood
wanting to defect.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">You're supposed to have gone. London stations
have been on to me.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Want to know what the hell you're doing.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Fuck off.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Anything else, Ricki?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I know what I am to the Circus.
I'm one of the scalp-hunters,</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">someone that you can hand
your dirty little jobs to.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I just...</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I just wanted to bring this one in myself.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Well, I understand how you felt.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">You wanted to do something.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I said that she claimed
to have information</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">vital to the safeguarding of the Circus.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Anything more?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I said that she had information
concerning a double agent.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Look, I just wanted to get the proper attention.
And I'd...</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I told them this was the reason
why I had not come home.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">It wasn't that I'd defected or anything.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- What did you do then?
- I waited for a reply.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I hung around for hours. I heard
the Imsak call to prayer.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">So what's that? That's about
3:30 in the morning.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Then the message comes through.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>We read you.</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">That was all they sent. Nothing.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">It didn't make sense. It was like
they were stalling.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Then what happened?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Then, all of a sudden...</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">the Russians begin to move.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">It was nice work. I couldn't
have done it better myself.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">The message was quite clear.
I needed to warn her.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Come on, come on, come on.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I couldn't find her at the airport.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I even looked through all
the flight lists and...</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I headed down to the harbor.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">They put her on a ship to Odessa.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">That's all I know.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I've...</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I've done a lot of things in my life,
Mr Smiley, but...</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I just...I can't stop thinking about her.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">She wasn't even my type.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I've got to get her out. I owe her that.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Karla will be looking for you.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Everybody's looking for me.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">You can't stay here.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">It isn't safe.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I said, <i>You may fuck me but you'll
call me "Sir" in the morning.</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">OK. Just need to let you know.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Someone flew into Paris last week
on one of our escaped passports.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- And?
- It was Ricki Tarr.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Why are you telling me?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- It could be coincidence...
- You are a poisoned dwarf.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Why don't you fuck off to his Majesty</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">and stop trying to involve me
in your cabaret?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Mr Esterhase: <i>It could be coincidence but...</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Mr Haydon interrupting.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>You really are a poisoned dwarf, Toby.</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>Why don't you fuck off to his Majesty</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>and stop trying to involve me
in your cabaret?</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">You look tired.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I didn't sleep well.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">You're going to do something for me, Peter.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I need the duty officer's log book
for last November.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I'm going to have to send you up a floor
into the lions' den.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">If you're caught,</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">you can't mention me.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I'm sorry, but you're alone.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Last November?
- Hmm.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Mr Guillam!</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Thank you, Bryant.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">How's the family?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Fine. Need to go up to the registry today.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">OK, sir.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Now you'll need a yellow one
for the bag, sir.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Thank you.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Good morning, Mr Guillam.
- Morning, Alwyn.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Want me to look after that for you?
- Thank you.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I'll need your chit, Mr Guillam.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Dolphin will kill me if I don't.
New rules.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">So, chit me.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Thanks.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Sal, lovely surprise.
- Peter.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- What are you up to this weekend?
- Oh, you know.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Visiting aunts.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I'll bet.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Corridor D.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">The two eights are halfway on your right.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">The three ones are next alcove down.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Thanks.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Here's a request from Libby Barr
from Bromley</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">for <i>Mr Wu's A Window Cleaner Now</i>.
Take it away, George.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Hello. Archive, Alwyn speaking.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Can I speak to Mr Guillam, please?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I'm his car mechanic.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Well, I'll just see if he's available.
Hold on, please.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>Mr Wu, what shall I do?</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Oh, Christ!
- Telephone, sir.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Who is it?
- Outside line, sir. Someone rough.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Sir?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Hello?
- Your gearbox is bust, sir.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Damn it, can't you fix the bloody thing?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Can't be done, sir.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Well, phone the main dealership first.
Have you got their number?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">No.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Hang on. Alwyn!</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Alwyn.
- Sir?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Get me my bag, will you?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- But...
- Just for a second.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Thank you.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Hang on.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Hello?
- I'm listening.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Yes. 9-4-6-0-3-3-5.
- Be right on it, sir.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Thank you.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Peter Guillam.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Could we see you, please?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Percy would like quite an
urgent word with you.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">If you can come now to the fifth floor
that would be so kind.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Yes, of course.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Throw that into the lift for me.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Send it to the second floor, save me
filling out bloody chits.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Will do, sir.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">So what have you been getting up to
down there these days?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Apart from chasing our virgins.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">A couple of Arab ploys that look
quite promising.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Apart from that, I'm getting
quite good at ping-pong.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Arabs.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">You can rent one but you can't buy one.
Right, Bill?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">How's Ricki Tarr these days?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Fine. We have tea at Fortnum's
every afternoon.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I require the matter of your discussion
with Tarr.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I'll tell him. He'll be thrilled.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">What's that shrug for?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I'm talking to you about the traitor</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">who cut the throat of our man in Istanbul.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I'm talking to you about a defector
from your own damn section.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I'm accusing you of consorting with
an enemy agent behind my back.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Don't damn well shrug at me!</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">How would you like a term in prison?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Well, I haven't been seeing him.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">So get your facts straight
and get off my back!</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">So...if I told you Tarr had
recently arrived in Paris,</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">would you be surprised?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">No, nothing would surprise me
about Ricki Tarr.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">And if I told you we happen to know
¬£30,000 mysteriously appeared</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">in his bank account last month,</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">would that surprise you?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Your man's a defector, Guillam.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Got turned by the opposition months ago
and now they've sent him back to us.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- What for?
- Never mind what for.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">To muddy the water, that's what for.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">To spread a whole lot of damn nonsense
to get us chasing our tails.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">The point is this.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">He's heading for home.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">The first peep from him, you come
to the grown-ups.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Understood?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Anyone you see around this table
but not another damn soul.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Get out.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Peter?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Thank you, Belinda.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>Oh, Mr Wu</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>What shall I do?</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>Oh, Mr Wu</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>What shall I do?</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>Mr Wu...</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">All go smoothly, did it?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I need to go to the hotel to see George.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Mr Smiley isn't at the hotel, sir.
Change of venue.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">George?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Mr Guillam...</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Sorry it took me so long to come home.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Ricki has been helping us, Peter.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">He's been telling us all
about his adventures.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">He's a double, George.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">There is no mole. Whole thing's
been thought up by Moscow.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Karla bought him for ¬£30,000.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I stole that because of you.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I spied on my own because of him. Do
you know how that makes me feel?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Ricki...</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">you said you sent the Circus a telegram
concerning Irina's information.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- That's right.
- What was the date?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">He doesn't know because
there was no telegram.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- The whole thing is a fabrication.
- 20th November.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">It must have been 20th November. Evening.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Irina kept telling me in Moscow Center</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">everybody on the top floor was laughing
themselves sick.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- She told me Karla...
- November 20th is missing.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Someone is covering their tracks,
unless of course you think</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">that's just a coincidence?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">What about the money?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">¬£30,000 isn't so much for Karla to pay
if it protects his mole.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I'm afraid someone in the Circus
knows all about Mr Tarr</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">and is doing everything they can
to discredit him.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Everything the Circus thinks is gold
is shit, made in Moscow.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Why didn't you tell me...
that you had Tarr?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">In case I never made it out of the Circus.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I should get some rest.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I suppose you've got your reading to do.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Come up.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I met him once.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Karla.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">In '55.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Moscow Center was in pieces.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Purge after purge.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Half their agents were jumping ship.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I traveled around, signing them up.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Hundreds of them.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">One of them was calling himself Gerstmann.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">He was on his way back to Russia</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">and we were pretty sure he was going
to be executed.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Plane had a 24-hour lay-over at
Delhi and that's how long I had</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">to convince him to come over to us</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">instead of going home to die.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">There's a little room.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I'm sitting here. He's sitting there.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">The Americans had had him tortured.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">He had no fingernails.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">It's incredibly hot.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I'm very tired and all I want to do is get
this over with and get back home.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Things weren't going well with Ann.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I give him the usual pitch.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>Come to the West and we can give you
a comfortable life,</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>after questioning.</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">What did he say?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>Think of your wife.</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>You have a wife, don't you?</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>Here. I brought you some cigarettes,
by the way.</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>Use my lighter.</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>We could arrange for her to join you.
We have a lot of stock to trade.</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>If you go back, she'll be ostracized.
Think of her.</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>Think about...</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I kept on...</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">harping on about the damn wife,</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">telling him more about me than...</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I should have walked out, of course.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">But for some reason it seemed important
to save this one, so I go on.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>We're not so very different you and I.</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>We've both spent our lives</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>looking for the weaknesses
in one another's systems.</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>Don't you think it's time to recognize</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>there is as little worth on your side
as there is on mine?</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Never said a word.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Not one word.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">And the next morning he got back
on his plane.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">He handed the pack of cigarettes
back to me, untouched.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">This was a chain-smoker, mind...</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">and he flew off to what he presumed
would be his death.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">He kept my lighter.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">It was a gift.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>To George from Ann.</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>All my love.</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">That was Karla.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">He went back to die rather than giving in.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Yes, and that's how I know he can be beaten.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Because he's a fanatic.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">And the fanatic is always
concealing a secret doubt.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">What does he look like?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I can't remember.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">After today, Peter,</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">you have to assume they're watching you.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">If there's anything you need tidied up,</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">now is the time.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Nearly done.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">For God's sake.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Sometimes I think they're all sharing
the same moronic brain.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">If there's someone else, you can tell me.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I'm a grown-up.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I know. It's just going to be
such a wonderful Christmas.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Excuse me.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>And I was too proud to give in</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>I had to learn the hard way</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- <i> That pride...</i>
- Peter, when you're ready</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Put it on now.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Everybody!</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Jerry.
- George.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Peter.
- Jerry.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I need to talk to you.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">About the night Jim Prideaux was killed.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">You were duty officer, weren't you?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Yeah. Control asked me to
man the phones that night.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">He said someone was doing
a special job for the service.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">He wanted someone he could trust.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Hurricane Henry set to be ridden

<b><font face="Arial Narrow">There's been a bit of a panic, sir.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">This is from the FO resident clerk.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">A Hungarian news bulletin.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>British spy, work name Ellis,</i></font></b>

<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I couldn't get a word out of Control.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">So I followed protocol and went
for the emergency list.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">You rang my house.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Just on the off-chance you were
back from Berlin.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">What did you say?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Hello?
- Hello, Mrs Smiley.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">It's Jerry. Jerry Westerby from the office.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Just that there'd been a bit of a crisis.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Ann said you wasn't back yet
and that was it.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Go on.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">All hell broke loose.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Military yelling about Hungarian tanks
on the border.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Lacon and the minister baying at the door.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Thank Christ Bill Haydon
turned up when he did.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Mr Haydon.
- Not now.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Mr Haydon!</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Out!</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Tell me.
- I tried to get hold of you.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I got half a story on the ticker tape
at my club. Tell me.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Jim Prideaux's been shot.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Get me the Hungarian embassy.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">You tell your masters what will happen</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">if one hair on Jim Prideaux's head
is damaged.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Get Esterhase on the phone. Tell him
to call in the Hungarian agents.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Yes, sir.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Any more news on him? Sir?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Oh, God.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">We need to get down to his flat,
clear out anything linked.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Haydon heard the news at his club?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">The Savile.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">At 1:30? The ticker-tape wouldn't
have been running.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">So how did he know?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Jesus, George.
- Peter!</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- How could he have known?
- It's not what you think.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Then how did he know?
- He was at my house that night.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Good flight?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Yes.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Pleasant enough.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I was just passing. I thought I'd call in.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Ann was in bed. She insisted on getting up.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">She said she'd be down in a minute.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">That's what I'm dropping off.
It's an awful daub really.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">But Ann expressed a liking.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">What's keeping her?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Keep going.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Come on, lads. Keep up.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Come on, Bill!</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Got your specs on, Jumbo?
- Yes, sir.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Come here.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Who's that fellow down there?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I don't know, sir.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Who is he?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Beggar man?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Thief?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Why doesn't he look this way, hmm?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Wouldn't you if you saw a bunch of boys
flogging a car round a field?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">What's the matter with him?
Doesn't he like us?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I don't hold with odd-bods hanging around.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">He might steal the Alvis.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Which is?
- The best car in England, sir.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Good lad.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">How were you briefed for the Budapest mission?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Control asked me to come to a flat
in Kensington.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">There's a rotten apple, Jim.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">And we have to find it.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">What did you make of it, Jim?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Control's theory?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I thought it was madness.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I know that it is one of five men.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">All I want from you is one code name.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Alleline.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Tinker.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Haydon.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Tailor.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Bland.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Soldier.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">We drop Sailor. It's too close to Tailor.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">And Rich Man doesn't seem to be applicable.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Esterhase.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Poor Man.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">And the fifth?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Smiley.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I thought it was madness.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">To think that any one of you
could have been a traitor.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Absolute madness.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">But you still went.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Why?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I went because Control asked me to go.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">It's called doing one's duty.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">At the station I met the legman supposed
to take me to the General.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">The waiter must have panicked.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">It was meant to be a simple snatch job.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">They drove me to some military hospital,</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">and then put me on a transport plane.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I could tell by the stars
we were heading east.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Then they worked me for...</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I don't know how long.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Weeks, maybe months.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">What did you tell them?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Everything.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I held on for as long as I could to let
everyone get the hell out of there.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Did they?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">My network's in Hungary, did they get out?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">No, they were blown.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">The story is you blew them
to save your own skin.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">After the interrogators had cleared out,
this little fellow turned up.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Looked like a priest.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">That's when they really started on me.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">What was your last line of defense, hmm?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">The mole.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Control's crazy theory.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I was going to bury that so deep
they'd never get it out of me.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Which was a joke.
- Why?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Because they already knew.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">All they wanted to know was how far
Control had got in his investigation.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">No, I don't know her.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Did they ask about me at all?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Yes.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">The little fellow did.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">What did he say about me?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">He had this cigarette lighter.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">He kept flashing it about for me to see it.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Showed me the inscription.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>- To George...
- from Ann.</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>All my love.</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Karla.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">It was odd.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">They sent me back to England.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Straight to Sarratt for debriefing.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">He said when he was being debriefed
at the Nursery, he had a visitor.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Who?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Toby Esterhase.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">He gave him ¬£1,000 and an Alvis.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Told him he was dead now.
Couldn't come back.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Had to become a lotus eater, forget
everything that happened.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Control's theory.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Tinker, Tailor. All of it.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Yes, that's what I thought.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">How on earth did Esterhase
hear about Tinker, Tailor?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Irina kept telling me in Moscow Center</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">everybody on the top floor was
laughing themselves sick.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">She told me Karla was very proud of this.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">She said everything the Circus thinks is gold
is shit, made in Moscow.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Irina kept telling me in Moscow Center</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">everybody on the top floor was
laughing themselves sick.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">No, I had a hotel nearby. They
do have some seedy rooms.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Irina kept telling me in Moscow Center</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">everybody on the top floor was
laughing themselves sick.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">She told me Karla was very proud of this.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">She said everything the Circus
thinks is gold is shit.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">This meeting is not taking place.
Is that clear?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Perfectly, Minister.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">There is a house somewhere in this city</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">where Alleline and the others meet
Witchcraft's London representative.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I thought Lacon had made it clear to you.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Keep your nose bloody well
out of Witchcraft's business.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">It's Lacon's advice I'm following.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">You told me to follow
in Control's footsteps.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I wouldn't consider that sound advice,
given the mess Control left us with.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">It has taken Alleline and,
if I may say so, myself</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">this long to get us back in the game.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">The man Alleline and the others meet
is called Polyakov.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">From Witchcraft to you.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">His real role is to receive
information from the mole</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">to take back to Karla.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">That, uh...that's not possible.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Made possible.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">By you in the house you persuaded
the Treasury to pay for.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Witchcraft's intelligence is genuine.
It's been gold.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">It's just enough glitter amongst
the chicken feed.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Control didn't believe in
miracles or in Witchcraft.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">But you were lazy and greedy</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">and so you hounded him out of
the Circus and you let Karla in.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">You opened negotiations to exchange intelligence
with the Americans.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">What they tell the Circus, they'll
be telling the Kremlin.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Witchcraft's information, the <i>gold</i>
Karla let you have,</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">it wasn't to lure you.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">It was to lure the Americans.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Now,</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">do you want to take credit for that?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">What can we do?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">We have one thing the mole wants.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- If I go to Paris...
- You'll go.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">If I go to Paris,</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I want your word that
you will get Irina back.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I don't care who you have to trade.
And I am out.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I want a family, thank you. I do
not want to end up like you lot.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">You will get her back.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I'll do my utmost, Ricki.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Oh, hello, George.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Hello.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I want to talk about loyalty, Toby.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Control recruited you, didn't he?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Found you starving in a museum in Vienna.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">A wanted man.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Saved your life, I heard.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">And yet when the time came,</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">when it came to picking sides
between him and Alleline,</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">you didn't hesitate.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">That's understandable, perhaps,
with your war experience.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">You survived this long, I suppose, because
of your ability to change sides.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Serve any master.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">What? What's...what's this about, George?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">It's about which master you've
been serving, Toby.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Intelligence has been leaked, Toby.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Someone's been taking files from the Circus.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">No, no, no, no. No.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">This is a mistake, a misunderstanding.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Files were delivered to a Russian attach√©,
weren't they?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Yes.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">And, yes, I delivered them.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">But so did Percy Alleline.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Good boy.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Bill Haydon.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">And so did Roy Bland.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Things aren't always what they seem, George.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">You should know that.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Look, Moscow thinks Polyakov's...</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">working for them.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Every now and then we give him
the odd file to take back to them.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Chicken feed, just to keep his bosses happy.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">But Polyakov's our Joe.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- He's a part of a big operation.
- Operation Witchcraft.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Yes, I know.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">George.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Please, I don't deserve this.
- Who gave you the message</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">for Jim Prideaux to forget about
Tinker, Tailor?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Bland.
- To get rid of Connie Sachs?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Westerby?
- Bland.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Or Haydon.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I don't know. One of them.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Or maybe Percy. No.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Well, I don't know who.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">You're just the messenger.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Running between them all.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Anything to serve Witchcraft.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I know all about your secret source.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">And I know something you don't.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I know who he is.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">He's Karla.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">One of you has been giving
Polyakov the crown jewels.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- I did not know.
- Are you still a wanted man, Toby?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Look, George, I didn't know. I...
- You picked the wrong side.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">No, you've got to believe me.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">George, please.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I am loyal.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I...I am loyal.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Don't...don't...don't send me back.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Please, George.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Don't send me back.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Give me the address.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Where do you meet Polyakov?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Hey, hey! Dog, dog, be quiet!</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">What is this? Who are you?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- What are the safety signals?
- The air vent.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Open and all's well, closed
and you're not to enter.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">And the microphone?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Peter?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">The boy stood on the burning deck
whence all but he had fled</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">The flame that lit the battle's wreck
shone brightly o'er the dead</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Beautiful and proud he stood
as born to rule the storm</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">A creature of blood, a proud
though child-like form</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">The flames rolled on...</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Merci. Au revoir.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Go on.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">The whole service is looking for you.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- They'll skin you alive if they find you.
- Maybe I want them to find me.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">You can go now. Leave the books
and put the keys in the machines.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">No, Ben stays here.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Ricki Tarr claims to have information vital
to the safeguarding of the Circus.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Mr Smiley?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Taxi approaching Circus.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Tinker.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Tailor.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Here comes Soldier.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Full house.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Well, go on then. Read it out loud.
- <i>Personal for Tarr from Alleline.</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>Require clarification before
meeting your request.</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>Quote, information vital to safeguarding
of the Circus, unquote</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow"><i>does not qualify, send further information.</i></font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Ah! That's it, Percy, you keep stalling.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I warn you, Ben. We've got some
really lousy people in this outfit.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I wouldn't trust a fucking one of them.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">The meeting's over.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">They're leaving.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Craddox says I'll be off in a few days.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I keep thinking how much I'm going
to miss the cricket in Moscow.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I was rather hoping you might do
a little light housekeeping for me.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">If I can.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">There's a girl. Give her some money,
would you?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">And give her a good cover story.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">If it helps, tell her I love her.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">It's all there.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">And there's a boy, too. Slip him
a few quid to shut him up.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I know the inquisitors' little bag of tricks.
I taught most of them.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">It's just a reaction.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">An over-reaction, if you like.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I did have one or two questions.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- About Prideaux.
- Goddamn it!</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- I got him back, didn't I?
- Yes, yes, you did.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">That was good of you.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I am surprised Karla didn't have him shot.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Or do you think he held back,</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">out of delicacy towards you?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Did Prideaux come and see you before
he left on the Hungarian mission?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Yes, as a matter of fact he did.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">To say what?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">To warn you.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Because he knew deep down</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">it was you all along.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">So did you.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I had to pick a side, George.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">It was an aesthetic choice
as much as a moral one.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">And the West has become so very ugly.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Don't you think?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Did Karla ever consider having
you take over the Circus?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I'm not his bloody office boy!</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">What are you, then, Bill?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I'm someone who's made his mark.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Is there anything particular you want me
to pass on to Ann?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Oh, that was nothing personal, George.
I hope you understand that.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Karla said you were good,</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">the one we had to worry about.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">But you do have a blind spot.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">He reckoned if I was known
to be Ann's lover,</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">you wouldn't be able to see me straight.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">And he was right.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Up to a point.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Up to a point.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I made this for you, sir.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">I don't want you hanging
around here any more.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Keep away from me from now on.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">- Go and join the others.
- But...</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Just...just bloody join in, will you?</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Go and play, damn you!</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial Narrow">Could you check, Jerry?</font></b>
