Stop bothering Paulie, Miranda.
l'm teaching him the ''happy new year.''
He has to learn it before tomorrow night.
- Look look, there it is. l win.
- Yay! Hooray!
- I'm sorry, honey.
- It is not bad.
You were in the way.
Why can't we live in a house
like Auntie Chloe's?
lf you put your mind to it,
you can have anything you want.
- Miranda!
- Auntie Chloe!
- Hey,
Come on, Paulie.
Come on.
- Heaven.
- Heaven would be exact.
Hey, amigo.
''Happy New Year'' in Chinese.
Not bad, eh?
You're learning Chinese then?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
l should have never given this away.
All the cousins get to sleep in the same room.
You are looking gorgeous.
- l look like crap, thanks.
- No, you do.
Casey! hello.
Casey, l want to have Christmas again tomorrow
l think you want to be a glove puppet.
- Argh!
- Get off, Dad.
Hey, Casey.
Look at you, all grown up.
Hi, Uncle Robbie.
Feel free to lose the ''uncle.'.
Come on, let's get this party started!
Say hello to your Auntie Chloe.
- Say hello, sweet pea.
- We're gonna have a lovely time.
- Who wants some Christmas presents?
- Me me me!
Who thinks it's gonna be the best New Year ever?
Yay!.
Look at Leah running around and everything.
-l know.
-lsn't it amazing?
l've almost got her off the inhaler.
- That's fantastic.
lsn't this great? The kids are nearly
as excited as we are.
Come here, little sis.
Ohh-hh.
Hey, Casey.
Hi
Don't spoil the weekend, okay?
There'll be other parties.
lt wasn't just a party.
You know l can't go.
Cause you're married to a knob?.
lt's two days, okay?.
You lot get your way for the rest of the year.
Maybe l'm allowed just a few hours.
You know how much we were
looking forward to it.
Pretty please,
-mouse.
-Don't call me that..
Please.
Paulie, it's okay.
lt's okay.
- Oh, sweet pea.
- Mommy.
- Ugh.
- You're carsick.
lt's okay. lt's okay, darling.
And help out Paulie this weekend, okay?
Did you ever hear of contraception?
No, really, Mom was in great form at Christmas.
Yeah, she was, euphemistically speaking.
Did they ban her from another pub?
Daddy, look.
You want to go get your presents?
Sorry, Casey got the Christmas presents.
Did you know Mom actually called here
at 11 :00 at night and
she wanted to speak to the kids and l--
- Mommy, Mommy!
- Hey.
l'm sorry, l can't invite her.
She just messes with their routine too much.
Do you know what l mean?
Hey, sweetheart.
ls that makeup?
We had a real ''Waste of Space'' Christmas.
Once we got the kids off to bed,
l made a special punch and we had
a naked snowball fight.
You should see the photos.
They're great.
A bit different from ours..
Granny fell off the toilet.
Mommy. Mommy.
- Oh, sweet pea.
- lt's all right.
lt's his latest trick.
Anyone would think he likes the attent--
Oh, Jonah.
You know he doesn't like that rough stuff.
Come here, darling.
Not like his mom then.
Okay.. l swear l had to grovel to the head
and all of Casey's teachers.
lt was terrifying
l think a little bit of wee might have escaped.
You should have just offered them all B.J.s.
l didn't want to get the cane
for speaking with my mouth full.
What's B.J.s?
Big-belly jimjams..
Oh, yes yes.
Hey, did you ever read the article l sent you
about MMR jobs?
Are you going to brush your teeth?
Come on.
Hey, Leah, Nicky. Bedtime.
Having a nice time with your cousins?
l love you.
Paulie. What happened with that
web design plan?
- Jinxie, come on, Jinxie.
- That was a complete waste of time.
lt was a bunch of techno stoners
playing SimCity all day.
Actually, l've got a much better idea.
- l met these guys recently--
 l can't get reception here.
Oh, there's a spot outside.
l'll show you.You can use anything.
Or you could use a landline.
Casey's not supposed to be speaking to anybody.
Daddy's grounded her.
Grounded?
Sounds exciting.
Mom's trying to build up
Jonah's confidence,
so we try not to listen to him..
Psst. ah - ah , sun - sun
soup - soup , op - op
hlw
Casey's drinking whisky.
Now this is heaven.
Oh, did you tell Elaine that we're
going to home-school the kids?
Wow. Are you qualified?
No, l mean, the school's
not that far away, right?
No, but l mean,
it just makes sense.. You know, since we
sold the business,
- we have the time.
- Jinxie, Jinxie.
And they're like sponges at that age, you know?
l really just want to give them the chance before--
l think that's a really good idea actually
cause l'm trying to teach MirandaMandarin now Chinese.
l mean, how many schools are doing that? None.
Why? Certainly none in Hackney. lt's crazy.
lf you look at the state of the global economy--
ls this another cult thing?
We're not gonna start chanting?
l look really fat in cowls.
hey Baby
What is it, baby?
- Are you okay?
Come here, sweetheart. What's the matter?
Paulie's scaring me.
Well, sweetheart,
hey, it's just Paulie.
You told me you loved him
this morning.
Okay?
lt's all right.
Miranda, why don't you
take Leah upstairs?
No.
Come on, darling, don't start.
Just let her stay up.
Well, Leah would love that.
Wouldn't you, sweetheart?
Maybe then we'll give Miranda
the gold star.
Yeah? Yeah.
- Wan an, Daddy.
- Wan an, princess.
Off you go.
- Come here.
 Night night.'Night.
Night night, slug.
'Night, Mom.
'Night, Mom.
Super Mama.
- Miranda?
- What?
Do you know how a real
UFO sounds like?
So are you still
in that school orchestra?
Oh, your dad said you play a mean flute.
l don't really call him dad.
Then you definitely don't
have to call me uncle.
Okay, it's right here.
-Got it?
-Yeah.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Hi, it's Lisa.
l'm either busy or dead.
Thanks for picking up.
You'd better not be
this useless tomorrow.
Jinxie.
lsn't this great?
l think we should have 10 more kids.
And look as tired as Lainey?
You think she's all right?
Well, you'd look tired after all that
rough stuff she's been getting.
Ecotourism? What a joke.
Snatch a glimpse of a gorilla
picking fleas off its asshole
and we'll burn off your atmosphere
with the air travel.
They're so lucky.. They have
They haven't got five business
brain cells between them.
And the home- schooling thing?
l thought Chloe's only qualification
was in yurt design.
Maybe they're getting into
fundamentalist Buddhism.
Why did you bring your Chinese medicine files?
Yeah, l just thoughtn Robbie would be interested.
Why'd you interrupt me any way when
l was talking about China?
Just support me a bit, okay?
l told you,
l think it's a great idea.
Come on, l thought you and me
were going to have
some fun this weekend.
Did your daughter
get that memo?
Good night, angel.
Leah, Nicky, come play with me..
l will take you to the moon.
Yee-haw!
Superman!
The strike zone.
Leah, Nicky!
- Yay!
- Me me me me!
Don't let the kids
go on that run, Robbie.
Stay with one seat.
All right, all right.. Come on, race me
to the top of the hill.
Come, Paulie, leave that now.
Where are you?
We've just got to pick Danny up
Lisa, Danny's, like, about five.
He's cute. And he constantly wanders about.
Anyway, he's feeling sick. We've got to cheer him up.
l've just had 24 hours
of nonversation. Just get here.
Don't pick me up at the house.
l'll meet you at the turnoff.
- You've got my map, right?
- Oh, shit.
Lisa.
Joke. We'll be there by 2:00 latest.
Why don't you go and fuck your horny uncle or something?
Whatever, baby raper
Have you seen Jinxie?
Catching mice in the woods.
Fancy a go?
Exercise gives you cancer.
- No adults in the tent.
l'm so sad l could fart..
Jinxie.
Mommy. Mommy.
Oh, l must be the most
lax vegetarian ever.
l just thought the kids would love
a little second Christmas.
Oh, Me too.
Does Robbie go to the city
much these days?
-Once in a while, you know,
the new lot need his advice..
Does he stay over?
-Not that often.
-Where does he usually stay?
- What? Oh, Lainey, the milk.
- Something smells good.
- ls Paulie okay?
- Where are you going?
- Yeah, l think so..
You too.
Is it good?
Yeah, great.
We're gonna do much more family stuff.
That's the New Year's resolution l've made anyway.
Does Casey help out much?
She bought the Christmas presents.
Was l that much trouble?
Lainey, you were pregnant.
Picky.
Well, we didn't exactly
have the best role model.
l'm not doing that bad a job, am l?
No, Lainey, no.
Okay, sorry.
Just promise you'll kill me
if l turn completely into Mom.
Okay, l promise..
I've missed.
You must know all about
Chinese medicine.
lt's another internet scam
he's fallen for.
You know, you could help
Elaine and Chloe.
Have you ever heard
of feminism?
Has it got anything to do
with self-absorbed lazing around?
l'm gonna get you.
So, Robbie, welcome to my office.
- Thanks.
l've been talking to these guys, right?
They import a lot through the internet.
--a lot of the ingredients from China.
And you know, it's already-- thank you..
lt's already a huge market.
You know that. Okay, darling.
But they really think it's gonna explode here.
The health service in this country,right-- it's a shambles.
When you go into hospital, you've got one disease--
you come out and you're fine.
And there's 50 new
 viruses, l think, identified every year
and they're spreading around.
Kids are especially...
TCM-- that's traditional Chinese medicine,Robbie,
not the TV channel--is about to go ballistic.
lnteresting side effects.
You're it.
l'll get you
Okay, come and get it.
Where's Paulie?
Oh, Jesus.
Chloe, are you okay?
l'm fine.
- lt's just a graze.
- Oh, l'm sorry.
- It was an accident.
We don't hit kids here, Jonah.
- Mommy.
- lt's okay.Daddy's not angry
- Daddy is angry.
- Daddy.
- Who was looking after him?
- Where were you, Casey?
-What did l do?
lt's okay. Don't cry.
l don't want to be here.
lt's just a little quiet time
while we all get ready for the party.
You are the oldest.
You have to be the mommy.
I feel sick, Mommy.
Then you should be a good boy
and lie down properly.
They're being funny.
l don't like them.
If you help Leah
dress up for the party,
l might give you another gold star.
Hmm?
Leah, come here.
Aw, sweetheart.
Stop it.
Can l have some?
Come on, it's not like
l've never had it.
Hey, Jim Morrison,
And you would an expert be?
Jim Morrison?
lt's a little bit last century.
Miranda and Paulie
are a nightmare.
Nah, they're just testing boundaries,
like you.
What's that?
They don't know, you see.
You can't say.
lt's a-- it's a baby.
Didn't you know?
l'm the abortion that got away.
Hey, carving time, eh?
l was just looking for Miranda.
Oh, she's upstairs with the other kids.
Happy nearly New Year!
Start, everybody.Don't let it get cold.
Robbie, you got any pepper?
Did you do the roasting?
Make way. Here's for everyone.
l think Robbie is getting pretty excited
- by my new business plan.
- Mommy.
... l think it's right up your street.
l think it'd be fun,
like a family business.
Let's talk about it later.
But you think there's something in it
lt's your sort of thing, isn't it?
- Bon app, everybody.
- Bon appétit.
Chloe, we could do, like, a junior TCM thing.
You know, like building the kids' immunity
in natural ways instead of all those dodgy...
Come on, no no no. Go and sit down.
Sit down, come on. Nicky, come on.
Jonah, l'm happy that you think
you've found a way to make a fast buck,
but l don't know why you think
that we would want to be involved in that--
illegally importing rhino horn or tiger bone
to cure fatal conditions like acne and impotence.
You do remember
what Chloe and l do for a living.
ls that a tattoo,
Casey?
Remember how you've always wanted one, Lainey,
and Mom wouldn't let you? Come on, eat something.
Show me.
Oh, that's lovely--
really, very seasonal.
lt's just a self-portrait,
really--
you know, what might have been.
Well, l think it's cool.
I feel sick.
- Mommy, I feel sick.
No, you're not sick, sweetie..
You don't have to copy everything that your cousins do.
Anyway, Miranda's gonna eat something.
Miranda, eat some dinner, please.
Just leave her.
- Now that's enough, Nicky.
- Oh, Jesus, come on.
Give it a rest, will you?
What if
l were to give Miranda another gold star
for eating some of your peas, eh?.
lt's okay. l can handle it.
Just leave her. She's upset.
Come on, let's have a playtime, eh?
Let's make an indoor igloo.
Come here.
- l want to play outside.
- Okay, we'll play outside.
Casey, do you want to give me a hand, please?
- Everything's ruined.
- lt's okay. Let me see.
Please just stop it.
What's the matter with you?
Who's gonna be the space man?
Who's gonna be the astronaut?
- I.
Who's gonna be the adventurer?
- I.
Leah, come here.
Your coat's not done up properly.
l'm glad you liked it anyway.
Let's just help your mom and Chloe a bit, eh?
l've got to make a call.
Beep beep beep.
Beep beep beep.
All right, l'm coming,
l'm coming.
I am so sorry.
Maybe she's ill..l thought Paulie was
a bit carsick last night,
but maybe he's picked up a bug.
Great.
You bring them here when they're sick.
You know how susceptible Leah is.
They're just kids, Chloe.
l mean, things go around.
lt's just the way it is.
Sit down.
My God.
Oh my God, Robbie.
Get the children inside, please.
Get the children inside.
Please.
Come here. derling
Oh, shit.
What the fuck is happening?
Listen to me.
Sit up there for one second.
Paulie.
Ambulance and police
are going to be a half an hour.
Police?
ln case the roads are really bad.
- God, what happened?
Bloody Paulie. What do you think?
ls he okay? Where are the kids?
lt's my blood, for God's sake.
Pass me the--
Casey, can you--?
Let him.
Where are the children?
Where are my babies?
Where are they?
l think they ran into the woods.
- God.
Chloe, stay stay.
lt's okay.
l'll find them. l'll get them.
They're just in the woods.
- I want my babies.
l don't know what to do.
ls he really dead?
Oh, you're so cold.
Tell me what happened, darling.
l don't know.
What? But you were there.
l think he was on the sledge.
He must have--
- You must have seen--
- l didn't.
l didn't see it, okay?
But you were helping
Robbie with the kids.
l wasn't there.
l was going up the road to meet Lisa.
She was picking me up so we could go to the party.
l came back.
l should be with Chloe.
Look for the kids.
Leah, Leah, what's wrong?
lt's me-- Casey.
Leah, it's okay.
Princess.
Hi, princess.
- Are you angry with me?
- Of course not, no.
l could never be angry with you,
whatever you do.
- Where is Uncle Robbie?
Come here. Sit down.
There's something
l've got to tell you.
Wo ai ni. l love you.
Wo ai ni, Daddy.
l'm sorry l hurt you..
l just felt upset.
What was upsetting you, princess?
- Casey.
It is okay.
Come on, Chloe, please come inside.
No, l don't want to leave him.
You're freezing.
Casey will have the kids back any second.. It is okay.
We can't leave him here.
Come on, darling.
No no, they said not to move him.
Please, come on. Chloe, come inside.
The roads are almost blocked.
Yeah, l understand that, but it's been
much more than half an hour.
- Help me. Mommy.
- Paulie.
lt's okay. lt's okay.
Here, darling.
Come on.
Mommy's here.
lt's okay, Paulie.
No, Paulie, wait.
lt's okay. Take my hand.
Take my hand, that's it.
Good, Paulie.
Give me your hand.lt's okay.
No, don't move.
No no no. See?
Come to me.
Come on, that's it.
Mom! Mom!
l'm sorry. l'm sorry.
Mommy.
Stop it.
- What's the matter with you?
- Leah?
Tell her not to go in the tent.
l'm not gonna leave you with him.
Please, Casey, tell her
not to go in there.
Sweetheart.
It's Mommy.
Sweetheart.
Oh my God.
Come on, get out!
Paulie darling.
- Oh my God, no!

Paulie, Paulie,
Paulie, Paulie.
Paulie, come on., Come on, look at me.
Daddy
lt's all right, darling.
l'll be in in a minute.
Just go inside.
She mustn't see.
All right, my darling?
Paulie was going to
stab me in the face.
Mother had to get him off.
She had no choice.
Mom,
you have to tell them.
I do not know.
l don't know.
You're monstrous.
How could you?
You never were much of a mother, Lainey,
but not even Mom would--
You killed your baby.
Jonah, what are we gonna do?
l think we should-- maybe we should
drive to the police station.
Nobody leaves here
until we find my children.
We can't go out there.
They were trying to stab you in the tent. You saw them.
- We have to find them.
- No, Chloe, don't!
- Let go of me.
- Don't.
l'm sorry.
Elaine, you stay here, wait for the police.
And the rest of us will look for the kids.
- l'm not leaving Mom.
- You do what l fucking tell you to.
No, she stays away
from my family.
Mom, Mom.
lt's me--. Mouse.
lt wasn't your fault.
They don't mean to.
l think they're ill.
There was puke in the woods.
And Paulie was sick last night, wasn't he?
Even if you don't believe me,
please don't go near Leah and Nicky.
I think they are very sick.
You were here.
What did she do to my babies?
Open your eyes, Jonah.
lt's Casey.
She was out there with Robbie.
She attacked me and attacked--
she made Lainey kill Paulie.
Oh, God.
Look, Jonah, blood.
My children's blood.
She's in my house.
What if they go back to my house? She's in there.
We have to do something, Jonah.
You have to take self-control.
Why aren't the police here yet?
We can't just stay here..
Shh, you're upsetting Mommy.
She's hurt.
She needs to rest.
Poor Mommy.
What about Lisa?
l'll call her.
She can pick us up.
- Help me find the phone, slug.
- l'm looking after Mommy.
Shut up.
Whatever you do,
please don't let them in.
Mommy.
Oh, God, you're so cold.
Are you sick?
Oh, God, you must be so cold.
Sweetheart, where's your brother?
Where is he, baby?
Where is he?
Oh my God,
l love you both so much.
- Mommy.
- My beautiful boy.
Mommy is here. l won't let anything
happen to you.
Nicky, don't do that.
Get up. Open the door.
Come on.
Get out, Miranda.
Get out, get out.
Daddy.
lf you've hurt her,
l swear to God...
Dad.
No no no, don't.
No no no!
Jonah, what's going on?
Mommy, Casey was hurting me.
Stay here, darling.
Fucking deserve it!
Jonah, please.
- Oh.

Be nice to Leah and Nicky.
Coming, Daddy.
It is okay, Princess.
Everything's all right.
Mom..
Mom.
Don't let them in!
Mom, don't let them in!
Mama, say something.
- Please say something.

Mom.
lt's okay, mouse.
It is Lainy.
Oh, God.
Stay.
Stay away from me, please.
l don't want to hurt you.
Please. Please.
No.
Where's Mommy?
God.
Paulie.
l'm sorry, Casey.

Bloody Jonah.

Oh, no.No, it's okay.
l'll go.
Okay?
Okay. Okay, baby.
It's okay. l'm here.
My brave little mouse.
I go to my mother.
