Hey, that bitch got a body.
Yeah, she got a body, man.

Let's see what's up in this motherfucker.
You ain't got to be creeping.
I don't know why you're trying to act

Damn. Always think

You feel sorry for who?
I don't want any trouble. Just get out!
- What the fuck did you say?
- I don't want any trouble.
You talking shit?
Every time I come in this motherfucker,

Yeah, yeah.

Give me the motherfucking video. Stop.
Give me the motherfucking videotape

Hey, nigga. Clean the cash register.
Come on. You shut up. You shu... Hey.

If you don't eject it

Hey, bitch, do it right now.
Bitch, I told your stupid ass

Nigga, hurry up!
Hell, yeah.
Come on, man. Let's raise up, man. Damn!
- Wha... I can't believe this.

I thought I told you
to open the damn register
Thought you were down.
How do you open this shit?
What the fu...?
Six motherfucking dollars, nigga?
Y'all got money

This don't make sense.
Let's just go, man.

Get this motherfucker, here. Shit.
Ain't gonna talk shit, are you?
Where all the money at, man? Fuck that.
- Fuck, let's go!
- Goddamn.
- Went into the store just to get a beer.
- Wait up.
Came out an accessory to murder
and armed robbery.
It was funny like that
in the 'hood sometimes.
But you never knew
what was gonna happen or when.
After that,
I knew it was gonna be a long summer.
One thousand persons
rioted in the Watts district last night.
They attacked police with rocks,
bricks and bottles...
before some 100...
officers sealed off the four-block area...
in the vicinity of 116th Street
and Avalon Boulevard.
Four persons were arrested
and a number of others...
including one policeman
were injured in the melee.
The riot was touched off
when three drunk drivers...
This is Donald Miller, Mobile Unit 3.
We're right in the center of this...
Burn, baby, burn
Burn, baby, burn
to battle rioters in the burning
and looted Negro area.
- Come on!
- What the fuck are you doing?
The commander
of the California National Guard...
said his troops sent
into the riot area...
would use whatever force
is necessary to do the job.
Residents
of this primarily colored area.
The rattle of gunfire
was heard increasingly...
in the Negro section
during the smoggy evening...
as the police confronted
roving bands of rampaging Negroes.
One guard unit opened machine-gun
fire for 10 minutes on a gang of negros...
who then fled down the street.
William H. Parker,
Los Angeles Police Chief...
angrily blamed
last night's violence...
When the riots stopped,
the drugs started.
My father sold dope...
and my mother was a heroin addict.
Moms and Pops were real popular
in the neighborhood.
They would always be having parties for
friends of theirs who just got out of jail...
or who was on their way to jail.
They only got married
because I was born.
My pop sometimes worked as an electrician
or a cab driver or a plumber...
but his main job was selling drugs.
Sometimes, Mom would use them all up
before he could even sell them.
Then he'd have to beat her up.
Growing up with parents like that...
I heard a lot, and I saw a lot.
I caught on to the
criminal life real quick.
Instead of keeping me out of trouble...
they turned me on to it.
That motherfucker's got
some love up there too.
I think there were some tears of joy.
You give me the pig, I get you...
And he said...
What's up, Pernell? Clyde?
KayDee Caine. What you doing out here?
Stop calling me that.
Shut up, little old nigga.
This party here for grown folks.
- Y'all ain't grown.
- We older than your little ass.
Tat know you out here?
Nope. I snuck out.
You a bad fucker. Come here.
Gonna get us in trouble. What you doing?
Now, go on and give the nigga a drink.
What the fuck is that?
What the hell you doing, boy?
You mess around and shoot all of us.
Let me see it.
Let me show you how to hold it.
Caine.
Caine.
What you doing out that room?
I'm just out here playing, Mama.
You better get your little ass in that room
before your daddy catch you.
You hear me talking to you? Now.
What the hell?
Pernell looked out for me when things
got rough. He taught me.
He showed me what being a hustler
was all about.
- Hi-ya! Twenty-one.
- Motherfucker!
Hey.
Hey, are you all done yet?
Yeah.
Hold up, bitch. Let us clean off the table.
Shit, I've been waiting all day.
- You got change for a 5?
- No. You got it.
- You got change for a 5?
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Cheating me out of my goddamn money.
Shit.
Gonna bust that head wide open, man.
Yeah. Yeah, I got something for you.
Say, Tat.
Your lady here looks a little tired.
Tat keeping her up at night trying
to knock the lining out that motherfucker.
Y'all are some damn motherfuckers, man.
- Fuck that shit.
- Come on, deal the cards.
Look, man. Tonight you got
the junk about two weeks.
Don't you think it's time
you gave me my money?
Told you
I ain't have your money yet, man.
Fuck you mean,
you ain't got my money yet?
Everybody know you hid the money
from that robbery before you went upstate.
I told you, motherfucker,
I ain't got your money yet, man.
What the fuck you mean, you ain't
got the money yet, motherfucker?
You best be coming up with my cash
or else, you know what I'm saying?
Fuck you, Tat.
The fuck you think you is, man?
Motherfucking Ron O'Neil or something?
Talking about I better pay or else.
I ain't your bitch, nigga.
What you gonna do?
What...? What am I...?
What am I going to do?
- Hold up, Tat.
- Get the fuck out the way.
No, no, no. Don't squeeze that shit, man.
I'm supposed to be scared now,
because you got a pistol?
I just spent five motherfucking years
in the joint.
I told you I'd pay your monkey ass
when I feel like it.
You better suck my dick.
- Suck on this, motherfucker!
- Damn.
Punk-ass, punk-ass fucking boy.
Tat, Tat, Tat, what the fuck, man?
- What the fuck...?
- You owe me some money, motherfucker?
Hell, no, but here you go.

Caine.
That was the first time I'd ever seen
my father kill anybody.
But it wasn't the last.
- I got used to it, though.
- Caine.
Caine.
KayDee.
Boulevard South.
It occurred at the Flamingo entrance...
Suspect is...
Whatever you decide to do,
remember what we learned.
And for those of you who are coming back,
I'll see you next year.
For all the bullshit they try to teach you
in high school...
I graduated with about half of it.
But then, I didn't go to school
but half the time.
The other half, I was out selling dope.
Growing up out here...
there was shit that can't be learned
in no classroom.
I just want to say...
- Yo, what's up?
- Is that me? Is that me? Is that me?
What the hell you doing?
Trying to ride this old raggedy thing.
You must want a new Big Wheel.
Yeah, because this old Big Wheel
doesn't work right.
Look, I'm gonna...
- Buy you a new one, okay?
- Okay.
- All right? All right.
- All right.
- What's up, little man? Hey, Caine.
- What's up?
Caine's gonna buy me a new Big Wheel,
Mama.
Oh, is he?
You don't have to keep buying him stuff.
It ain't no thing.
This is my partner right there.
- Ain't that right, little man?
- Yep.
So you finally did it?
Yep. Finally done.
All right.
Oh, man. Congratulations.
Hey, come on.
Let's make it in the house.
Ronnie was Pernell's girl
before he went to the pen.
Anthony came right after that.
Pernell hooked up a house
and a little money for them.
But I still went by to check on them.
My pops was killed in a drug deal
when I was 10.
And my moms was too strung out.
So I went to live with my grandparents
in Jordan Downs.
It was only supposed to be temporary.
But my moms died from an overdose...
so I just stayed.
Hey, Grandma.
Me and your grandpa
are so proud of you, Caine.
Thomas, come on out of that room.
Come on down here
and say hello to our grandson.
The Lord's grace is with you, boy.
And I wanna let you know...
that next week
when you get that diploma...
I'll be the proudest grandfather
in all of L.A.
And I know if your mama and papa was
still alive, they'd be proud of you too.
It's all right.
Let's dip into the cock pot, man.
Graduation night.
My homey Doc threw a party.
- My cousin Harold rode with me.
- What's up?
He stayed down in Long Beach
so we didn't hang out that much.
Now, he was a hustler.
Had a Beemer, a crib, and a fat pocket.
Whenever we were together and some shit
popped off, I never had to worry.
He had my back, and I had his.
Man, we was down
for each other like that.
All the homeys was down for each other.
What's up? What's up?
Caine's in the house.
What's up? What's happening?
What's up?
- Where's the Doc? What's up?

Hey, man, let me get back to this shit.

- What up, Caine, locster, nigga?
What's up? Where the bud at, fool?
Nigga, watch me break
these motherfuckers here.
Y'all give up this snatch.
Know what I'm saying?
A-Wax was older than the rest of us.
I mean, he was what we called a "G."
Always in the middle of things.
Instigating, arguing, fussing.
He was funny to us.
He had been putting in work
for so long...
it got to a point where he liked to see
other people do dirt.
Now, O-Dog was the craziest nigga alive.
America's nightmare.
Young, black and didn't give a fuck.
Do it, fool.
Oh, man. Nigga crapped out.
Give me my fucking money, nigga.
Give me my shit.
- Crapped out like a motherfucker.
- Y'all fucking bullshit.
Brew's in the cooler.
- Give me my motherfucking money.
- Yo, nigga, throw that money down.
- What's up, black man?
- I'm cooling.
Why you got that hood on your head?
Look like the grim reaper.
It's cold out here, my brother.
You know us black folks not used
to this cold air.
We the tropical people, you understand?
Let them Europeans deal
with this madness.
Then why your tropical ass
sitting on the goddamn cooler?
To keep you fools
from drinking this poison. That's why.
You better get
your shelenkem-shilom ass...
up off this box
and pass me a motherfucking brew.
Sharif was an ex-knucklehead
turned Muslim.
He was so happy
to be learning something he liked...
he kept coming at us with it.
He thought Allah could save black people.
Yeah, right.
Yo, Caine. Toss me one, homey.
Now, Stacy thought he was the pimp
of the bunch.
We was homeys since we were little.
He went to a different high school,
though, because he could play ball.
After he got that scholarship...
he was always talking
about going to Kansas to play football.
I'm telling you, man. I'm straight starving.
I gotta get something to eat, man.
Y'all niggas hurry up, man.
I'm hungrier than a motherfucker, man.
Yeah, yeah. Man, I got the munchies

We can't leave Harold here like this.
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
Hey, man. We can't leave him

Hey, Sharif, that motherfucker's dead.
He's dead, man! Fuck that. Let's go.

He's bleeding to death.

Where the doctor at?
Yo, give us a motherfucking doctor.
You'll have to fill out these forms first.
Bitch, fuck the forms. We need a doctor.
He's bleeding to death there!
This bitch can't find us a doctor.
Look at him. He's bleeding.
Get a fucking doctor right now!
- Where's that bitch with the doctor?
- Where's the doctor?
A week out of high school
and I got blasted in the shoulder.
I went to shock
when I saw all that damn blood.
I mean, I ain't never been shot before
so I thought I was gonna die.
They kept me in the hospital
a week or so.
I mostly stayed up thinking about my cousin
and watching old gangster movies.
I've gotta see some identification.
How about my Army discharge? Got it here.
What you doing here?
Are you surprised
or is it that you don't wanna see me?
No. I just thought my grandparents
were gonna come and pick me up.
Well...
I told them they didn't have to.
I told them I would come get you...
and they could stay home and relax.
And your grandmother gave me
your clothes to give to you.
Oh, shit.
First, I get shot.
Then you're gonna drive me home?
Somebody must want me to die.
Trying to say I can't drive?
Yo, Rashid, Rashid, hold up.
- Have you seen my wife?
- Merry Christmas, Daddy!
Kids! Pete.
Kids! Janie, Janie. Tommy.
- Where's your mother?
- Looking for you.
- With Uncle Billy.
- Daddy.
Zuzu. Zuzu, my little ginger snap.
How do you feel?
- Fine. Not a smidge of temperature.
- Not a smidge of temp...
- Hallelujah.
- Hello.
- George! George, darling.
- Mary, Mary.
George, darling!
- Where have you...?
- What's up, O?
- What's going on, big boy?
- Just chilling, man.
You going to come on out today?
Yeah.
- I'll be in front if you all need...
- KayDee, Kevin.
Come on inside.
What's up with that, man?
Yeah, you come over here
and sit right there on the couch.
Hey, y'all.
Can you stand right over here
by the tree? Right there.
Well, I guess I better let y'all talk.
Now, what I wanna talk
to you two about...
is the trouble
that you've been getting into.
Boys, the Lord didn't put you here
to be shooting and killing each other.
It's right there in the Bible.
Exodus 20:13:
"Thou shall not kill."
- Grandpa, I ain't never killed nobody.
- Oh, I doubt that.
And, Kevin, I've heard stories about you.
Sir, I don't think God really care
too much about us.
Or he wouldn't have put us here.
I mean, look where we stay at.
It's all fuck...
It's messed up around here.
You don't have any belief, boy.
The Lord don't care
about who's got the biggest house.
My grandpops was always coming at us
with that religion.
And every time it would go in one ear
and out the other.
Caine.
Do you care whether you live or die?
I don't know.
Come on, man, let's bail. Come on.
Boy, oh, boy, man. Shit.
Sorry about that, man.
Grandpa can get carried away
with that Bible and shit.
- Hell, yeah, he be in Church every Sunday?
- Faithfully.
I mean, sitting there praying
to a white Jesus.
Man, black people got too much
damn religion as it is.
- What I'm saying.
- But anyway, man.
- What's up on the shoulder, boy?
- It's fucked up, but it ain't no thing.
That ain't what you was hollering
to the hospital.
You was:
You was sounding like a little bitch, man.
Fuck you, man. That shit did hurt.
You fools swear you all so damn hard.
I heard that shit.
- What? Who? Who?
- "Stay up, Caine. Don't die."
- Wasn't me.
- Trying to act caring and sensitive.
Yeah, that was you.
We still mad at you
for dropping all that blood on us, man.
Fuck y'all.
I almost died in that motherfucker.
Shit, man. I was gonna tell you something
before we went up the house, man.
What's up?
Oh, nigga, guess what.
Word got back about the little marks
who jacked you and Harold.
I know where they be kicking it at.
Down with the 187?
Let's do this.
Do this for Harold, man.
Man, you getting down, nigga.
Yo, Wax, check out Caine.

Shit. Hey, hey, check this out.
Check this out. Boom!
Yep. Nigga, did y'all see that?
Yeah.
You bad, nigga.
That nigga shot that boy. Straight up, boy.
- Didn't know I had that shit in me.
- Give it to me.
You jacked that Korean!
- You like that shit.
- You always try to put a show.
Yo, dog. Let me get a dub
of this motherfucker, man. This is bad.
Oh, shit. Man, fuck that.
I'm selling these motherfuckers
for 59.95.
- I got money, nigga. Shut up, Wax.
- Fifty dollars, you can have this.
Oh, shit. This gonna be a trip.
Caine ready to put a hole
into the fucker?
Yup.
All right.
- Shut the fuck up, nigga.
- Fuck, man.
- Hey, man, this with the...
- Yo, man! What you doing?
Point that somewhere else. You stupid.
Y'all scared like some bitches.
I seen lots of people killed before
but I ain't never done it myself.
I mean, I never had a reason to.
But when they killed my cousin...
I knew I was gonna kill them.
Hey, man,
so you like my little tape, don't you?
- Yeah, that shit was cool, nigga.
- Yeah, nigga.
- That was proper.
- You should have came to the Wax, boy.
- He could have did it much better.
- Oh, shit, nigga.
It's all about O-Dog, nigga.
I'm larger than that nigga Steven Seagal.
I'm gonna be a big-ass movie star.
Look, nigga. I told you
to stop showing the fucking tape.
Man, why you keep on bitching
about my tape, man?
Goddamn.
Ain't shit gonna happen. All right?
All right?
Damn. Now, we're just gonna find
these little marks and smoke them.
Shit ain't that hard.
As long as there ain't no crowd. I'm not

Hey, man, who the fuck gonna be old

Shit, nigga. I smoke anybody, nigga.
I just don't give a fuck. Shit.

Look, all right. Not me, all right.
I'm not killing no kids.
You know what, nigga?

You acting real paranoid and shit.
Now, these motherfuckers smoked your

Blew his head off in front of your face

You acting like a little bitch

Man, fuck that.
I ain't letting that shit ride.
We gonna go ahead

I don't care who the fuck out there.
Goddamn it!
- Is you down, nigga?
- Man, both of y'all shut the fuck up!
Both of y'all acting

Scared to peel
these punk-ass niggas' cap.
Man, give me

Fuck you, nigga.
Shit.
You go hook us up with them

Why don't you get away begging,

Hey, who you saying begging?

You go ahead and get us one of them dogs.

You hooked us up 50 times.

You all niggas, hurry up. Go in there.

Hey, nigga, I wanna know

Are you ready to do this shit

And don't be acting like no pussy

Hey, you wanna go to my house?
My mom's made a big-ass
pot of chitlins.
Let's rush them chitlins.
We don't need no hot dog.
That's where you all need to be,
in the house. You got a curfew.
Why don't you take us and get us

Fuck you, nigga.
It's time for both of you all to go, okay?
Let's go to mom's house.
We don't need this shit.

- Go home to your mammies, okay?
Yeah, nigga. Break out...!
Bitch, shut the fuck up
before we blast your ass too.
Shut the fuck up.
Hey, homey, you need some help?
Punk-ass nigga. Come on, niggas.
I thought killing those fools
would make me feel good.
But it really didn't make me feel
anything.
I just knew that I could kill somebody.
And if I had to...
I could do it again.
What's up, Caine?
How you doing today?
I'm all right.
That's good.
I'm tired. I'm in there studying.
- You want something to eat?
- No. I'm straight.
Okay, have a seat.
So where's Anthony?
He's in the back taking a nap.
He should be up in a second, actually.
- Can I use your bathroom?
- Yeah. You know where it is.
Shit.
I got some money
this time, man. I got $2.
You ain't got no money, nigga.
Where that motherfucking 20 at?
Nigga, come with 20, nigga.
You owe me a dub from last week.
Oh, nigga, much as I buy from you,
you gonna trip about that? Come on, man.
Look, man. I got $2 for you, man.
I know I'm a little short but...
- You know...
- You a motherfucking fool.
- Come with 20, nigga. Come with 20.
- Man, I ain't got nothing.
- Come on.
- Hand nigga's money back.
Give me my $2 back, man.
I'll go buy a cheeseburger, man.
Let me go buy a burger.
Man, as much as I buy from you,
you gonna come on me like that, man?
Get that fuck...
Leave me alone.
I gotta save, man.
Come on, man, give me my money back.
Hey, get Weed. Get Weed.
- Caine?
- What's up?
Wanna play me in boxing?
- What do you think?
- I'll whoop your ass.
Anthony, what did I tell you
about your mouth?
- What? Why you tripping?
- What do you mean, why am I tripping?
Because he's 5 years old
and he has no business talking like that.
Well, you gotta
be hard growing up out here.
Caine, that has nothing to do
with being hard, okay?
Because he gets that crap from you,
Dog, and that fool, Stacy.
Well, Pernell showed me what's up.
And? Is that something to be proud of?
And speaking of his father,
I got a letter from him today.
- He asked about you.
- For real?
- What's he up to?
- Nothing.
Lifting and trying to read every book
in the library.
When I'm done in here,
I'll get you your letter.
All right, cool.
I'm gonna be whooping your son's ass
in this game.
I mean...
we're gonna box and shit.
I mean, you know, a little some...
Come on, Anthony. Let's just... Come on.
I'm gonna beat your butt.
- Get out of here. Damn.
- I made these cheeseburgers, man.
What's with your motherfucking teeth?
That's from all the cheese I've
been eating. You want burgers? Come on.
- Fuck out of here, man. You stink.
- Oh, shit. One time.
- Break!
- Go around. Yo, come on.
Go around.
Move, man. Move, move.
Hold up.
Now I'm gonna wear you out, little punk.
Let me see that.
The gun.
All right. Where did I put that letter?
Oh, here we go.
Is this it? Yeah.
Now, see, you hold it like this
and pull the trigger.
Pow! Punk-ass.
Look, it ain't loaded.
What the hell are you doing?
I don't want my son
learning to pull drive-bys!
- I was just showing him how to shoot.
- Yeah, Mama.
Anthony, get over here. Get over here.
Let me tell you something.
If I ever catch you with a gun in your hand,
I'm gonna break your tail. You got that?
Get out of here.
Get up and get out.
How many times do I have to tell you
to stop giving us money?
Don't give me that shit, okay?
Because I don't see nobody
with no fucking job around here.
You know what?
I don't need your money.
Look...
Pernell looked out for me, okay?
- If it wasn't for him... No. Listen.
- Don't start...
If it wasn't for him,
my black ass would be dead by now.
- I'm paying back.
- You know what? Fuck Pernell.
Because you don't owe him shit,
all right?
You need to be glad
that you graduated from high school...
and that you're alive at 18.
You need to do something with yourself
before you end up like he did.
Look, I'm not gonna end up like he did,
all right?
Oh, really?
Why you tripping? You act like you
never was down. What's up with that?
Caine, it's not even about being down,
all right?
I got a little son to look after.
And you know what's really sad?
Is that I look at you...
and you remind me
of how Pernell used to be.
- Yeah, and?
- Yeah, and what?
Look at you.
I gotta go, all right? Here.
Cool.
This is the good part.
- Yeah.
- Hey, what's up, nigga?
What's popping?
What up? It ain't nothing. Hold on.
- Who that?
- Co-Caine.
- Hey, where you at?
- What's up, man?
I've been trying to page you all day.
Come on, man, I... Who there?
Me, Wax, Lew-Loc...
that motherfucking
faggot ass Chauncy.
So what's up? We gonna roll or what?
- So you down with rolling tonight?
- Oh, it's on.
All right, bet.
Turn this shit off, man.
- Wake that fool to answer the door.
- Yo, what's up?
Get your bitch-ass up
and answer the door.
Fuck you, nigga.
Got a baby doll and shit.
Because I like little girls, nigga.
Where your sister at?
Where your mama at, nigga?
Motherfucker.
You made something to eat.
Ain't make me shit.
- Bring me some.
- You ain't shit, nigga.
Yo, who is it?
Nick?
- Yo, nigga, what up?
- Nothing.
Why you come so early
all the time, man?
- You said 1:00.
- I don't give a fuck what I said, nigga.
I don't get out of bed before 2:30.
Don't come through this so early next time.
Understood.
Let's see what you got.
This motherfucker here.
- "Black Nissan Maxima, 1990."
- Yeah.
It's gotta look exactly the same, okay?
- Yeah, cool, cool.
- They don't...
- Yo, Wax.
- Yeah.
- Yo, nigga.
- What?
Let me get some links with them grits.
Hurry up.
I'm hungrier than a motherfucker here.
- Go ahead, Nick.
- It's gotta be...
in excellent running condition too.
Insurance company ain't gonna give money
for a car that doesn't run.
- Can you hang with this?
- Yeah, I'll hook you up.
All right.
Be here tomorrow night...
about 10:30.
I'm sorry. Did...?
Are you sure you mean tomorrow night?
Do I stutter, motherfucker?
No. Tomorrow night. That's fine.
- Did I stutter?
- No, you're right.
What, you scared to come
through this neighborhood at night?
No. No problem.
You ain't too scared to have a black man
steal for your funky ass.
- You're right.
- Get out of here.
Okay. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks.
Don't bring your ass over here no more.
Go on back up to Westwood
where you belong.
Hope you find your way
down Compton Avenue, motherfucker.
Man, get your
motherfucking heads down.
Got me out here with bullshit, nigga.
Be at the motherfucking crib
getting blunted and shit.
Got me out wasting...
One more, one more, one more.
I'm sure the shit down here somewhere.
- Bingo.
- That motherfucker right there?
- That's it.
- Okay, cool.
Oh, shit.
Look at the motherfucking wheels.
Yeah, that's it right there.
Damn. Rims is tight like a motherfucker.
Give me the Slim Jim.
Hurry up, motherfucker.
Get the fuck out.
Don't be tripping.
You all niggas hurry up.
Caine, get me the motherfucking radio.
- Hey, are you watching out?
- Nigga, hurry the fuck up.
I know what I'm doing. You watch out.
- Nigga, you...
- Come on, man.
- Got it. Yeah.
- You got it?
Damn, man. Come on, get in.
Damn.
- Where the screwdriver at?
- No, no, the screwdriver.
- Let's get the fuck up out of here.
- Shit.
- Hold it right there!
- Freeze!
Let's go!
Okay, let him go.
Go.
All right, guys. Let's go.
Follow him down.
- Oh, shit!
- Hey, man, it's a dog. Hey, get...
- Hey, get the fuck off!
- Fucking get off me!
- Get off!
- Hey, come get y'all's dog!
Come get this motherfucking dog!
Hey, get the dog off my homeboy!
Get the fuck off!
- Fuck, get off me!
- Hey, come get this dog!
Since it was my first offense...
Well, actually, the first time
I ever been caught for anything...
the judge reduced
my crime from grand theft auto...
to attempted joyriding.
They let O-Dog off with a warning
because he was still a minor.
My dad had been to jail before.
Pernell went to jail.
I mean,
even O-Dog had been to youth camp.
But I didn't care what any of them said.
It was no place I could get used to.
Motherfucker, you don't own me, nigga.
Man, you got some money or not?
Come on, man.
Why don't you hook me up this time?
Nigga, you crazy? Hook you up?
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Check this out.
Got these burgers.
They some double cheeseburgers.
Nigga, I just ate. I just ate, fool.
I don't want
no motherfucking cheeseburger.
If you ain't got no money,
you just assed out.
Call this motherfucker.
Yo, Dog. Hurry up!
- Fuck, man.
- Come on, man. Wait, wait, wait, man.
Man, man, I'll suck your dick.
- Just hook me up.
- What the fuck you just say?
Man, I said I'll suck your dick.
- Come on, man, just get...
- Fuck.
Damn.
Suck on that, you bitch-ass trick.
O-Dog, what the fuck you doing?
Yo, Dog! Hurry up!
Any of you all want a hamburger?
What's wrong?
You don't want no hamburger?
- I don't want no hamburger.
- Even if it got cheese on it?
- Man, you stupid.
- I got it from that basehead.
You stupid.
I didn't even have a record...
but when they fingerprinted me,
the cops matched my prints...
to the ones from that bottle I dropped in
the liquor store the night of the robbery.
Now, listen to me, you little bitch.
I'm gonna ask you
some real simple questions...
and I want some real simple answers.
You understand?
Let me get this right.
You bought the bottle of beer...
about 11:15?
Ye... I bought the beer
and I accidentally dropped it.
You bought the bottle of beer...
at 11:15?
I... Elev... Yeah. A...
At 11:15, I...
Yeah, 11:15.
Then why wasn't the bottle cleaned up?
- Why did we find it still...
- Be...
there...
spilt on the floor...
after the shoot?
When I was...
After we was leaving, after I left...
Pe... Other people was coming in.
They... When we was leaving.
- But you don't remember what they...?
- What they look...
But you bought the bottle of beer
definitely at 12:15?
Yeah, it was 12:15, exact.
- If I'm not mistaken, it...
- Now, you see something?
Now, you see, now...
you done fucked up.
You know that, don't you?
- I said...
- See what I'm saying?
No, I thought...
Yo, I'm saying you done fucked up now.
You know that, don't you?
The more questions that cop asked...
the more I thought
I wasn't gonna never see daylight again.
And this time, you said
you bought the bottle of beer...
I was just waiting for them to tell me
they seen that damn videotape.
But they hadn't.
Yeah... I...
You know you done fucked up,
don't you?
- I...
- You know that, don't you?
You know you done fucked up.
Without the tape...
they had nothing.
What's wrong with my brother?
He's sick as a dog. Look at him.
Caine, man. It's Stacy and Sharif.
You all right, man?
Hell, no. I ain't shit in a week.
Goddamn. In a week.
Come on, brother. You wasn't there
long enough to catch the HIV.
Fuck you.
What you fools want anyway?
You still want me to take you
to get this car or what?
Hold on.
Come on, get up from off your knees,
praying to that porcelain god.
That white porcelain god.
Why don't you chill, Farrakhan?
Hey, man, you better not throw up
in my ride, man.
Ain't nobody gonna throw up
in your ride.
Say, homey, why don't you
come to Kansas with us?
What, nigga?
You all need to stop
calling each other "nigga."
That's what you need to stop doing.
Anyways...
nigga, I said you should come
up to Kansas with us.
You going deaf, motherfucker?
You going to Kansas with this fool?
Yeah, Caine. You should come too.
I mean, you're not doing nothing here
but getting yourself in a lot of trouble.
Your grandmother would be happy.
Shit, I ain't going no place.
I think Ronnie got a lock
on this fool is what I think.
- Fool, you tripping.
- Caine.
Wait. You still
pushing up on Ronnie, man?
Man, hell, no. Pernell would kick my ass.
Oh, shit.
Nigga, on life without parole?
I don't think so.
You spend enough time
up in that motherfucker.
You should be trying to fuck.
I know I'd be trying to fuck.
What about you?
Yeah. Whatever. Here, put that in for me.
You better go somewhere
with that black power shit.
You know that shit gets no play
in this ride.
Man, I wish this motherfucker
would hurry up.
Oh, there that motherfucker go
right there, shit.
What's up? You all gonna kick it?
No, man,
I gotta go scoop up one of my kids.
All right, man.
As-Salaam-Alaikum, my brother.
What is that, man?
Get that shit out my face.
That's for Junior and shit, man.
Now get your ass in the front seat, man.
This is the ride, bro.
- Hey, you got the bread?
- Shut up.
This shit legit?
Hey, I told you, man.
My brother works at the DMV.
All the numbers are clean.
I had the dope ride...
but I was sitting on some bullshit.
I needed some rims bad.
And I knew just how to get them.
And I sure in the hell
wasn't gonna pay for them.
All I had to do
was catch some fool slipping...
and jack his ass.
- Turn that motherfucking shit down.
- Shit.
Nigga, what the fuck
you want from me?
Nigga, you know what the fuck I want.
I want your motherfucking Daytons
and your stereo.
- And I'll take a double burger with cheese.
- What?
Wha...?
Motherfucker, order my motherfucking food.
Hi, may I take your order please?
Yeah...
let me have a double burger...
- Some fries...
- Motherfucker, I said with cheese, nigga.
Shit.
Hey, yo,
make that a double burger with cheese.
You almost made me shoot your ass
over nothing.
Hey, come on, man.
We supposed to be brothers.
Oh, what, you trying to get smart?
Oh, you trying to catch some mileage?
Fuck that.
Give me your motherfucking jewelry.
- Take that shit off.
- Shit.
You got a pager too.
You're a baller? You a baller?
Yo, give me this motherfucking shit.
Better me than the motherfucking cops.
Yo, what's up?
Chilling.
Yeah. I had to creep up
on some fool today at the drive-through.
Trying the high sign and shit.
I had to get him.
Yeah, but a trip.
A nigga straight on short.
Yeah. I need you to hook me up
with some shit.
How much you want, nigga?
Give me like 400.
All right, give him 400, man.
- What up?
- What's up, black?
How much you all fools got back there?
Got enough.
You gotta make this shit up yourself.
- I'm gonna watch this motherfucking video.
- All right.
- What's up, nigga?
- Chilling.
Everything you need
up on this damn sink.
Clean up before you leave.
This better be 400.
Oh, don't even
come at me like that, partner.
Working for minimum wage
was never my style.
I like big dollars.
I learned how to mix drugs
when I was little.
Heroin, cocaine, all of it.
My dad taught me.
That was about the only thing
he taught me before he was killed.
You in my way.
What the hell are you doing?
Hey, calm down, baby.
That's one of my natural reflexes.
Oh, so what? You like being in my way?
What you think?
Hey, they call me Caine.
- I'm Ilena.
- Ilena?
Goddamn. This shit is gonna be good.
Real good. Real good.
- What up?
- The Holy Koran says if you...
I don't wanna hear that shit right now.
- How you be talking to the other bitch?
- Watch your mouth.
Yo, Wax.
Turn that motherfucker up, man.
Shit.
What's up, girl?
Yo, Stacy.
What up?
That nigga Caine out there trying to play
Mack Daddy in the parking lot?
Nigga, yeah. That's that nigga, man.
Trying to be me and shit.
Hey, yo, Caine. What's up, nigga?
Hey, what's up, nigga?
Man, leave that bitch alone.
Nigga, what's up?
I'm gonna call you, all right?
- Yeah.
- You take care of that body.
What up?
- What's up, fools?
- Hey.
- What's up?
- What's up, man?
The fool think he hard,
now that he a little convict and shit.
Hey, man, fuck you.
Hey, which one of you fools
put this picnic together, anyway?
I don't know, but a nigga like Stace
gotta get his eat on and shit, man.
- Hell, yeah.
- Lew-Loc over there bullshitting on the grill.
- What's up with that fool?
- The meat is ready.
- Hell, yeah.
- What's up, fool?
Yo, hold up, man.
- Hold up, man.
- Watch out, man. Calm down.
- I got this piece.
- Not too close.
Hey, chill, boy.
- Yeah, I'm out.
- Why the fuck you let this nigga win again?
- Shit.
- Fuck you, nigga.
I won and I'm out, so pay me.
Pay me in bud.
Hey, hey, Sharif.
Hey, man, is that your pops over there?
That's him. Where you coming
from with a smile on your face?
- What's up, Mr. Butler?
- I smelled that barbecue.
You all know,
I ain't passing up on a barbecue.
- Oh, we heard that.
- Pops wanna get his eat on.
- Let me sit down, here.
- Go ahead.
Now, I know
there's some food left, right?
Hey, hey. Hey, Keisha! Keisha!
- What, nigga?
- Bring Mr. Butler a plate.
A nice size plate, Keisha.
Anyway, Pops, I'm glad you come...
because I was talking to my brothers
about drugs, the community.
I always seem to be outnumbered.
I just wanna know your opinion of it.
You know, well, as I see Kevin trying
to hide that reefer, it's okay to smoke it.
I used to smoke a little reefer myself
when I was younger.
Bet you ain't never smoked
the chronic, though.
I ain't never...
I don't know nothing about the...
They're not doing nothing but destroying
their minds, falling into the devil's plan.
What the hell is the devil's plan, nigga?
This is the devil's plan.
That's the devil's plan.
- Don't throw it on me.
- All right.
Hey, don't throw away
my motherfucking joint.
Hey, 'Rif.
Man, why you always tripping, man?
- I know. Calm your boy down.
- I mean, you got a father, man.
And you got a grandmother
and a grandfather.
I'm pretty sure they tell you
everything that my father tell me.
But you don't listen anyway,
so, what's the difference?
No, no, man. Hold on. Mr. Butler, man.
I'm just curious to know
what's up about that, you know...
Sharif be coming at us every day.
I mean what...?
- Straight up.
- Why does he act like this?
- What are you all talking about at home?
- Sharif's a good guy, man.
That girl a little slow on that plate,
ain't she?
- Hey, Keisha!
- Hey, hurry up.
Bring the motherfucking plate.
Excuse my language.
- Why do you think that's so funny?
- Because it is.
You know, I could see it now.
You're gonna go up there
and mess around...
and bring back
one of your devils to my house.
Wait. You know
I'm not bringing no devil to the house.
Oh, I see you checking out
them white girls.
You know how I feel about black women.
Why you go and throw that on me?
I ought to take you outside
and knock you out. Right now.
Hey, hey, hey, boy.
I brought you in...
- I'll take you out.
- Yeah, okay.
What's up, Caine?
It took you long enough, my brother.
- Anyway.
- Hey, KayDee.
You know, so what's up, young buck?
- Man, I'm all right.
- Yeah?
- How's work?
- You know...
white man always on your back,
but what else is new?
Have a seat.
- What's up, man? Chilling.
- What's up?
So, what you all talking about?
- Not much, just chatting.
- Yeah, we're talking about this Kansas trip.
Kansas?
So, what about Kansas?
So, what are you gonna do, KayDee?
You gonna fuck around out there
in the streets...
until you get killed?
Like your cousin, maybe?
What's that, sir?
Well, Sharif tells me him and Stacy...
have been trying
to get you to leave with them.
Yeah...
but I don't know about no Kansas.
Yeah, yeah.
You know, I hear you there, you know?
I was teasing Sharif
about that before you came in.
But what are you gonna do if you stay?
You know, Sharif used to get
into all kinds of shit...
before he found the Nation.
Now, I'm no Muslim.
But I agree...
with some of the things they say
regarding black people.
And if Allah helps to make him
a better man than Jesus can...
then I'm all for it.
What you trying to say, Mr. Butler?
Whatever changes you have to make...
then you just do it.
You gotta think about your life.
Being a black man in America...
isn't easy.
The hunt is on.
And you're the prey.
All I'm saying is...
All I'm saying is...
survive.
All right?
Mr. Butler had me thinking...
because he was the only one
who ever came at me...
like he gave a damn.
And Grandpops always kicked
that religious stuff...
and my dad never said anything.
Pernell showed me
how to survive on the streets...
but Mr. Butler was talking
about surviving for good.
How did it go between you and that girl
you met at the barbeque?
- Oh, the baby in the black shorts?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I fucked her.
- I did, fool.
- Yeah. Well, I hope you wore a hat...
because a couple of brothers
eased up in that.
Come on, now.
Don't even play me like that.
You know I'm packing a plastic. Shit. I
ain't going out like Willy Lump-Lump.
Well, if you don't pack the plastic,
you're definitely going out.
I don't know
if it's like Willy Lump-Lump.
Whoever that is.
Who is Willy Lump-Lump?
Oh, a little inside thing. It ain't nothing.
It ain't nothing.
Growing up in the 'hood, we were used
to getting sweated by the cops.
I mean, they would follow us
in the car, then turn away.
I mean, they would stop us
for no reason and question us.
Especially with a car like mine,
a 5.0 and Daytons?
I knew we was in for it.
Hands on the hood and spread your legs.
This motherfucking hood is hot.
Are your hands burning?
I thought you boys liked barbecue.
- Why don't get somebody's...?
- Shut up.
- You got a smart mouth.
- Get on there.
What's up with reading me my rights?
- Shut up.
- Why don't you just read me my rights?
My tags are up to date, man.
I got registration.
- Yeah. That's enough. Come on.
- Read me my rights!
Just because I'm a black man,
that's why. A black man.
I'm gonna beat your motherfucking ass!
- That's why...
- Shut the fuck up!
If I was white...!
- Get the fuck in the car, both you guys.
- Oh, shit!
Fuck, man. This thing hurts.
- What the fuck you doing to us?
- Quit fucking moving!
- Hey, fuck this, man!
- Stop fucking moving!
- Stop! The hell, are you crazy?
- Shit! Shit!
Shut the fuck up!
I told you to quit fucking moving!
Hey, get me the wire cutters, ése.
Fuck you, holmes. I ain't doing this shit.
So, what are you gonna do?
Are you gonna go with me?
You take care of it.
Hey, what's your fucking problem, man?
- That's cool.
- Take care of it.
But don't forget, all right, holmes?
- Hey, check it out, holmes.
- What's up?
What is it, holmes?
- See? Over there.
- Let's move on them, ése.
Don't sweat it, ése.
That night, the cops let us have it.
They dropped us off
in the wrong 'hood, where the éses stay.
I guess they was thinking
we'd get our ass kicked even more.
The éses was cool, though.
They took us to the hospital.
You know you can read this yourself.
- I know, but I like it when you read it.
- Okay.
Mom, why'd the police beat up
Caine and Sharif?
Did they do something bad?
No, I don't think they did.
I think it was a big mistake.
You know? Just a big mistake.
Like the same kind of mistake
ever happened to Daddy?
No, what happened to Daddy
was something different.
You know, with Caine...
Well, see, you have
a certain group of people...
that don't like another group
of people for whatever reasons.
And the police...
didn't like Caine and Sharif very much.
My friend Michael says
the police hate black people.
Well, no, no, no. That's not true.
- That's not true at all. Some of us...
- Mom, is Caine gonna die?
No.
Caine's not gonna die.
Caine's gonna be just fine.
Okay? So don't worry about it.
He'll be fine.
You look so mean.
Why don't you smile for a change?
I ain't got shit to smile about.
You're alive, ain't you?
Yeah, and who says that's good?
Well, guess what.
I got a job.
- For real?
- Yup. Sure did.
My aunt hooked it up for me.
Making decent money too.
It's about 24 a year.
What are you gonna be doing?
I will be doing office stuff,
thank you very much.
You know, filing, typing...
- That's cool. That's cool.
- Answering the phone...
getting coffee.
Stuff like that.
Caine.
The job is in Atlanta.
Caine.
Did you hear me?
I said the job is in Atlanta.
Hey, take it.
I mean, you might as well
get the hell away from here.
Well...
to be honest...
you know what I was hoping?
I was hoping
that maybe you would come with me.
Came with you?
Yeah, I mean...
you ain't doing jack shit here.
And the way I see it...
you'll be dead or you'll be in jail.
I mean...
I don't know.
I don't see it as such a bad idea.
Why are you so worried about me?
Why shouldn't I be?
Think about leaving, Caine.
I got to thinking about all the things
I done on the streets...
and all the things
I probably would end up doing if I stayed.
I mean, being on the streets was cool.
But I cared about Ronnie.
And, well, Anthony.
He reminded me of me when I was little.
I didn't want him to grow up
and go through what I've been through.
It was all so crazy.
I mean, things
was starting to look different to me.
It was the end of the summer.
Ronnie had a little going-away party.
She and Anthony
were getting ready to move to Atlanta.
And Stacy and Sharif
were getting ready to leave for Kansas.
Why are you drinking up all the beer?
I don't know what you been
going on with that.
Could you please save some beer
for somebody else?
Oh, who, like Caine?
- Whenever that fucker come...
- See, Caine, that's the key word.
You ain't Caine.
Stop drinking up all the beer.
You're all on his nut sack.
- Hey, y'all.
- What's up?
I'm gonna go in this game,
take some of y'all money.
Why don't you go over there
and try and talk to a girl for a change.
Why don't you wash your feet?
- Stinking ass.
- You kiss my ass.
You got one, motherfucker.
- Hey.
- Like I was saying...
how can we say that we're equal...
- When we gotta go to them for jobs?
- Cut that bullshit.
- Get up.
- I was talking to the lady.
She don't wanna hear that shit.
Like I was saying, we're not equal
until we have the same amount...
- Who is it?
- Five-O, nigga. Five-O.
I'm selling encyclopedias, motherfucker.
- Oh, y'all brought jokes.
- What up, what up, what up?
- Please.
- Mr. Wax in the house.
- Hey.
- And the 'hood rat's in the house.
'Hood rats?
Don't start that 'hood rat shit.
You know ain't nobody no 'hood rat.
- Don't let me break on your ass.
- Hey, where's Ronnie's fine ass at?
- Break something on me?
- Yo, baby.
- Yo, yo, yo, what up?
- What up, what up?
Stacy, how many times I gotta tell you?
Don't smoke that when Anthony's home.
- Goddamn, what you talking about?
- You know what I'm talking about.
Go take that shit outside.
- Can you take it now, please.
- You wanna to go outside with me?
Hey, little man, what you doing?
Just playing games.
You know, if you need anything,
I'm right in the next room.
I'm thirsty.
Can I have some beer?
Beer? No.
You may have some juice.
Hey, this is for the homeys
who ain't here.
My motherfucking cousin Harold.
Hey, Reef, why don't you go
and get a little hit of this?
- It's all right, Kevin.
- Oh, man. You're a little punk, man.
Yo, what's up?
Boy, you better get your butt back in
before your mama try to kill us all.
- Hey, Ant, what you doing out here?
- Just kicking it.
Yo, let me have a drink.
Hey, no, man. No.
Man, give the little nigga a drink.
Man, what's wrong with you, Kevin?
Don't be giving this kid no liquor.
- You ain't his daddy.
- You're not either, Kevin.
Shit.
Anthony, what are you doing out here?
You know better.
Come on. Let's make it.
Get in the house.
And, Caine, can I speak to you
for a second?
It's about to rain out here.
Pussywhipped.
She got that nigga in some panties, man.
Take your juice and go to your room.
Go on, boy.
What up, babe?
What up, what up, what up?
- How you doing?
- I'm fine.
- Come here, come here, come here.
- Chill.
Chauncy, chill out, nigga.
Oh, nigga. I'm just joking.
You know you're my nigga, Caine.
Yo, Ronnie.
I'm gonna catch you later.
Caine, me and you, baby.
Cock-blocking motherfucker.
Why haven't I heard from you?
I been busy.
Well, have you at least thought
about what we talked about?
Yeah, about leaving with you?
Yeah, I thought about it.
Why are you tripping?
You ain't doing jack shit here.
Caine, why don't you just come with me?
Ain't nothing gonna change in Atlanta.
I mean, I'm still gonna be black.
Just another nigga from the ghetto.
Why do you say stupid shit like that?
Because it's true.
I mean, you act
like Atlanta ain't in America.
They don't give a fuck.
You know what?
You know what Anthony asked me
the other night?
He asked me if you were gonna die.
If you were gonna die, Caine.
Are you gonna come with us or not?
Yeah, I'm gonna go.
Hey, that's not cool, all right?
Let me guess, man.
You was up in there
knocking it out?
Get out of my business, Stace.
Me and A-Wax, Caine went to the Laker
game last night. Why you sweating me, girl?
All night, motherfucker. Hold on.
- Come here. I'm just fucking with you.
- Stop.
- Okay. Let's not.
- Come here. I wanna talk to you.
- About what?
- Let me get this dance.
- No dancing. You're drunk.
- Come on, Ronnie.
- I've been checking you out.
- I know.
That Caine be standing in my way.
Sit down. You're drunk. No dancing.
What's up with Chauncy
tonight, man? He over there tripping.
Why you pulling my arm?
Are you crazy, Chauncy? Will you stop it!
- Dog, you strapped?
- You know it.
Give me your gun.
- What for?
- Give me the motherfucking gun.
What you gonna do, Caine?
Man, what you need a gun for?
I don't give a fuck
what you're asking. Get off me!
Man, come on.
- Fucking...!
- You crazy motherfucker!
Caine, stop it. It's not that serious!
Will you stop it?
You're going to kill him!
Get him off of him! Get him off of him!
Stop it!
- Chill out, man!
- Fuck that nigga!
Anthony, get in your room!
Get in your room.
Fuck that, man! Fuck him!
Fuck! Fuck him, man!
Yeah?
It's me.
Ilena? What's up?
Caine.
I'm pregnant.
What?
I'm pregnant.
What the fuck you telling me for?
What? What, so you're just
gonna dog me?
It ain't mine.
Look, you're the only one I was with.
Stop lying, all right?
Besides, I had the jimmy on extra tight.
That don't mean nothing, Caine.
That mean it's not mine.
Caine, so, what?
You man enough to take a life,
you ain't man enough to take care of one?
Look, I ain't got time for this, all right?
Peace.
Damn, man. Hey, man, this motherfucker
on this team, he whooping this boy ass.
Man, this is a good-ass fight.
This is like Caine beating your ass
the other night, man.
Yeah, nigga?
I bet you Caine won't be laughing...
after the five-0 get a hold
of this motherfucking tape.
You can bet that shit, nigga.
Look, man. If this was Caine
whooping your ass on this TV...
Hey, nigga, fuck Caine, nigga.
Motherfucking Caine.
Don't talk to me about Caine.
- Man, fuck you. That look like you.
- Punk-ass motherfucker.
If this was you on TV, you got
your ass whooped. I don't give a fuck.
How you doing?
I'm fine. And you?
Living.
The baby?
He's fine.
Let me talk to Caine.
Ronnie.
I love you.
It's been a long time, Caine.
How you doing, man?
How come you ain't never come
to see me?
Man, I didn't want to see you
caged in like some fucking animal.
Is that what you think?
I'm an animal?
No, man.
When I was growing up...
you was like my dad, man.
Your letters...
in the beginning...
it got me through, young bro.
Away from my girl...
away from my baby...
away from you.
Go with Ronnie, Caine.
Oh, man, that ain't even...
I know how she feels about you,
and that's cool.
She's a good girl, man, you know?
I just want her to be happy.
You take care of my son.
I can't do shit for him in here.
You teach him better
than I taught you, man.
Teach him the way we grew up
was bullshit.
All right?
Give me some.
Hey, nigga, give up the car right now.
Look at your ass, scared straight.
Nigga, I was just tripping with you.
Hey, I ain't got time
for this shit no more.
What's wrong? Why you acting like a ho?
Where you just coming from?
- Went to the pen to see Pernell, man.
- For real?
That nigga get mad at you or what?
- He all right.
- Oh, cool.
- That boy out there...
- Hey, which one of y'all is Caine?
Who is this fool, man?
Who want to know?
A friend, homey.
Homey, hey, I don't think you know me.
Check this out.
I'm Ilena's cousin, partner.
She don't like the way
you've been dogging her and I don't either.
We supposed to fight over a bitch?
I think you need to watch
who you calling a bitch, partner.
I think you better watch
who the fuck you...
Go ahead, scrap that fool.
Rush him, nigga! Rush him!
Hell, you stomp. Yeah.
Trying to come in my 'hood
and start all that shit.
Stomp! Stomp!
KayDee! KayDee!
Caine. Caine.
Get your ass in the house.
Punk motherfucker.
Proverbs 22:10
Cast out the scorner
and the contention shall go out.
Yea, strife and reproach shall cease.
So, what you trying to say, Grandpa?
Son, you got to go.
I don't want you to remain
in our house another night.
What y'all want me to do?
I want you out of here tonight.
We're sorry, Caine.
Y'all not too sorry.
I mean, y'all kicking me out.
I've done all I can do for you.
We tried our best to raise you.
But you're bad.
I wasn't gonna tell y'all until later...
but in a couple of weeks...
I'm moving to Atlanta with Ronnie.
I mean, can I just stay until then?
I hope you're not gonna mess up
that girl's life, Caine.
- Grandma, I'm not...
- Caine!
Now, I sincerely hope
you get your life together.
Lord knows I do.
But I cannot have you in my home
one more night.
Grandma...
Fine.
The same day I was leaving...
O-Dog had told me the cops was looking
for us over that liquor store robbery.
He didn't care, though.
He just hid out
with different homeys each night.
Doc dropped a dime
on Chauncy's punk-ass.
O-Dog was gonna kill him
if he didn't get caught first.
Man, I ain't going nowhere, man.
And you'll be a silly motherfucker
if you leave with this broad, man.
Straight up. I ain't bullshitting.
Shit, Ronnie.
Just you and Ant moving or you taking
the whole fucking house with you?
Can you just take the box to the car?
Thank you.
- What's this for?
- So you can take it to the car.
I don't know
why y'all want me to help y'all move.
I ain't the one leaving.
Sellout motherfucker.
What seems to be your problem?
I was just thinking about...
saying goodbye to my grandparents.
You haven't talked to them yet?
Well, if you want to,
we can stop by there before we go.
But can you take some of these bags
to the car, please?
You keep bossing me around,
I ain't going nowhere.
You ain't going where?
Hey, coz, come on, man.
Look, I just don't want you to go out
and do something crazy.
Don't worry about shit.
I'm gonna handle this nigga for you.
Yo, I got to handle my business.
Stupid ass, quit looking out, nigga.
Just get in the car.
What's up, homeys? Hey, let's go twist
this nigga's cap back, man.
Let's go. Let's do this.
- Come on, dog.
- I ain't getting paid for this.
- I ain't getting paid for this shit.
- Nobody's not getting paid, Kevin.
This nigger got a gang of shit in here.
Okay, Kevin. Let's stop arguing.
Bitch.
Fuck that. Fuck. Y'all niggers ready?
Fuck that. We got to break this nigga up
something real proper-like. Man, fuck it.
Vroom, vroom, vroom. Bam!
I bought you a new Big Wheel.
You gonna hit me?
Just gonna crash into me?
Fucker.
Caine. Caine.
Thought you was gonna help out.
You lazy.
L-A-Z-Y, lazy.
Vroom, vroom, vroom.
You're lazy. You know that, right?
I want some money for this, Caine,
for real.
Yo, what's up now, partner?
Get down, Ronnie! Stay down!
Damn, Sharif.
What the fuck happened, man?
Get off me. I gotta get Anthony. Get up!
Come on. Get some fucking help, nigga!
- Get going.
- My God. Caine.
Get Anthony out of here. Get him out.
Go get some fucking help, nigga!
- What's wrong with this nigga, man?
- Get some fucking help!
Not my niggas.
Come on. You're gonna be all right.
You're gonna be all right
Get some fucking help! Shit!
Get the fuck out of here!
Oh, shit. It's okay. You're okay.
Don't quit now, nigga.
Come on, come on.
Fight. Fight.
Come on. No.
You're just fucking me up again, you know.
Come on, baby.
After stomping Ilena's cousin like that...
I knew I was gonna have to deal
with that fool someday.
Damn.
I never thought he'd come back like this.
Blasting.
Like I said...
it was funny like that
in the 'hood sometimes.
I mean, you never knew
what was gonna happen or when.
I had done too much to turn back...
and I had done too much to go on.
I guess in the end...
it all catches up with you.
My grandpa asked me one time...
if I care whether I live or die.
Yeah, I do.
And now it's too late.
