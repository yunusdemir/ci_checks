- Some people believe
we are in a pop concert.
It is a celebration of mourning.
Madame de Lindois, Nicky ..
.. "Granny"
for her grandchildren ...
- She knows
it is a funeral?
- In Asia, white
is the colour of mourning.
Are we in Bangkok, here?
- She will not change
her traditions for you.
- Mom, Dad,
not today.
- I bother you?
Can I continue? Thank you.
Nicky, I said, you often talked
About your deceased husband ..
.. With which you lived
57 years of marriage.
57 years..
As said ..
Our Lord Jesus, ..
.. "Jainkoak..
.. " betiereko bizia eman dauku.".
- It's Basque.
- "Haren Semearen ..
.. "baitan den bizia."
But he said it in Aramaic.
A woman laughed.
- You sing well
Basque.
- And you,
you laugh loudly.
- Alice, Antoine's wife.
- Antoine?
- Your cousin.
- Ah yes, Antoine.
"Doing?
- My grandmother died.
- Oh yes.
Mine too.
- He likes your work.
- I also read your work,
but I rarely agree.
- I agree
with people of opposing views.

.. Is bigger, yes.
With heart pulsations,
Inevitably, huh...
- "It is not noticeable at all.
- Really?
That's nice.
My condolences.

comfort in private.
And, Alice pick me ..
..opens my mouth
and sprays lemon juice.
- A glass?
- Thank you very much.
You are a family
friend?
Really?
- I know the turtle ..
That .. looks constipated.
Ah damn.
You're really pity.
I want to
tinker her. Not you?
- She laughs loudly.
You heard his voice?
- What?
- She is the crazy kind.
I am fresh, spontaneous
take me in the hay.
I do not like her luscious skin.
- You're in love, look like
a goat seller.
I'll do someone else.
It's okay.
- These are children.
- So what?
- You're a psychopath.
- Thank you.
- I then committed
Three serious errors.
First, I started
Michel Legrand in my iPod.
57 years together ...
If they managed, why not us
Two generations after, we cannot?
- We steal the champagne?
- Excuse me?
- You stole
the champagne.
- Oh yes.
- Can I have some?
- You can ...
I am training for
when I have Parkinson's.
- Ah okay.
What are you listening?
- I do not know.
Guess.
And here is my second mistake.
- I know, this.
Michel Legrand.
- Yes.
- That's it?
Soundtrack
"The Thomas Crown Affair."
- What year?
- What?
- What year?
- 68.
- I'm bad with
English.
- Yes, can tell.
But it is charming.
- I cry
when I see "Peau d'ane" (The Magic Donkey).
- You too?
No one cares,
when I say that.
- Really?
It's weird.
Guys! Marc Marronnier
cries watching "Peau d'ane"!
- No, no.
I cry the moment..
.. killing the donkey that lays
gold coins.
You are...
- Me, when the fairy says
not to sleep with his father.
- Yes, this fairy is
locked in her box, ..
.. Very conformist.
- It's beautiful.
Looks like a poster.
- I love how
you talk about nature.
- I want
to dive in.
- You go, like that.
You are full of life,
it is unbearable.
- You want to drink from the bottle?
- Yes.
- Well, no.
- It's here.
I learned to swim here
I was 7 years old, with Mr. Rimbourd.
I jumped from there..
For my third triton..
A feat.
I'm crazy about you. Then
I ate an apricot donut.
The best donut
of my life.
What do you think?
- Where is your wife?
- My wife?
- I hate liars.
- I have not insisted
for her to come.
Her family is complicated.
So her husbands...
- I love your family.
You were ..
.. Close to your grandmother?
- Yes.
She was great.
For example,
she voted it left.
She fads.
- Which?
- She hated
girls in thong.
- I never wear them.
My feet are filthy.
- You are
lovers?
- We look so stupid?
- Yeah ...
- Do you swim?
- No, it is
too cold.
- Chochotte.
- No.
Thank you, Lord.
Tell me, little
why you say that?
- Allo?
Why would she
undressed in front of you?
- This is my third mistake.
Believe what
Children say.
You were supposed to tell me?
- Stop sending me
your address and code.
Your cousin
is my husband.
- I'm not very family.
And then ..
You did not need ..
come to tell me this.
You wanted to see me,
but you will not dare admit it.
- Pretentious.
- Take a shower,
this will relax us.
- You had a shower
in your life?
- Yes, no ...
Finally, how is Peau d'ane?
- Still virgin.
- Oh yes.
And your feet?
- Still awful.
I just reverse
TV on mine.
- For what?
- I do not like winners
Who scam my alimony.
Do not look
there is nothing, there.
You can ..
.. help me remove
my shoe?
- What's going on?
It seems
that something is broken.
Oh yeah.
We must go to
emergencies.
I can not
amputate here ..
Considering the hygiene,
you risk diphtheria.
- Really?
- Oh, shut up!
- It's red, it's red!
What you do not like,
in life?
- Do not bother
wasting time.
- I'm afraid
of feeling bad.
- You have not spilled all?
- I reserve some.
- "Doing?
- Nice car.
- She is cute.
I have plenty of room.
Then.
- But,!
- You're scared,
It's funny.
I'm afraid
of feeling sick.
- Wait, seriously?
I forbid you.
If you want to vomit, I stop.
I am
"Vomitphobe".
Doctor? Doctor.
Please.
- Yes?
Put this here.
- He kicked his TV
and vomited.
- I was not alone.
- He must have a
broken foot. Look.
When I do this
it hurts.
Its broken.
- And?
He groaned.
And you?
- Me, AA will.
- Ask him.
You use a this
Foot a lot?
- One out of every two.
- We're doing an x-ray.
You need anything?
- No, thank you.
- It may be long.
- I will walk again?
- It depends.
- I have ..
Stop by the agency..
see some boards.
We will not ...
- Goodbye.
Go, do not look back.
Do not hold on to me.
Clear this episode
from your memory.
- Impossible. Your Indian name is
He-who-stinks-of-vomit.
- Alice?
- What?
- How did you get
your license?
- We wont see again.
- So, I call you?
OK.
In the 21st century.
Love is .. an SMS
unanswered.
Texting is a form
torture very refined.
A day without response
we believe in a strategy.
Two days unanswered,
we get offended.
3 days without response
We fall in love.
Alice left  me
eight days without a response.
- Yes.
- We stop
kisses between men.
- A gothic outfit?
you see Amélie Nothomb?
- I am in mourning
of me.
Bring me
a glass of Destop.
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi.
She is looped.
- Finally, I like it.
It's pretty exciting.
- You look like shit.
- Translate.
I am the saddest person
I've ever met.
Unless a saucepan ..
Milk ..
overflowing.
- He's not very well.
He feels like ...
- Saucepan.
- A pot of milk.
- I get the picture.
- Are you sure?
I love someone ..
Not available ..,
is fucking with me.
Else
I feel great.
- It's too bad.
- It's too bad ...
- But We have something
to announce to you.
- Have you seen Tatayet?
- Yeah ...
- I do not know if this is the right
time, but we're getting married.
- What?
- You take any drugs?
I was curious.
Take a tour to
the courthouse.
To have a picture.
Divorced.
- Oh, no. We are sure, sure.
- There is also something else.
Marc, I would ..
You to..
be my witness.
- Crisis meeting
immediately.
In the bathroom.
- What are you doing?
- In Eastern Europe,
there are ears everywhere.
Listen.
You want me to be
your witness? All right.
But let me ask you
a simple question.
Why do you want
marry Kathy..
..the French specialist in
libertinism?
- The answer is simple.
Because I love her.
And you find this good enough?
- You, you want to conquer.
After, you are bored.
When Kathy is near me,
I am..
..happy.
- So, why marry her ?
I'm divorced
and I love a married woman.
The marriage is
to put people ..
In .. shit.
- For the present, I would say
"Kathy, my wife." She ..
.. "Here is Peter, my husband.".
It's stupid,
but I am proud.
- It is. What all
these personal pronouns?
My wife, my husband,
my dog.
I am happy,
and you yell at me?
- Sorry.
You're lucky.
As a witness,
I had ..
Warn you .. Pierre ..
Love..
decreases with time.
This is ...
- Marc.
As a friend ..
I gotta tell you ..
that love ..
Grows ..
with time.
- But no.
- Here.
Read this.
There.
- There?
"Love does not alter
in hours ..
.. "But to survive the tip
of the end of time.
"If it is false,
and proven to me ..
.. "I have never written
and nobody has ever loved. "
- "I never writ,
nor no man ever loved. "
- Who is the idiot
who wrote it?
- William Shakespeare.
- Ah.
Yes, there's a ...
There are still ...
There is a style.
Why not.
The octosyllabic.
- So?
- I agree.
- Oh, my God.
My fiance is so gay!
- She is on the street.
When a girl arrives late,
one can imagine her approach ..
.. her entrance, her silhouette.
The arrival is romantic.
I must tell you
something.
we can still ..
.. not fall in love.
we can ..
Go back ..,
but after not.
- Too late.
I want you.
I want you to ruin it,
You are disrespecting me.
I don't want you to derail me.
I'm hot.
- I love romantic arrival.
There's amnesic arrival.
- Hello.
Excuse me, are you?
- Marc.
Marc Marronnier.
Guethary ...
- No, I'm sorry.
- There's aggressive arrival.
I do not wait for other's
orgasm to come before mine.
I do not take the pill,
and if I am pregnant, I keep it.
- Even not bad.
- Sometimes it is better to go
physical.
- Oh, it's hot.
It's hot!
- Oh yes.
Terribly effective.
And then ..
At a time ..,
there ..
True .. the entrance.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- We sit?
L'hotel Amour
this is a subliminal message?
- Not at all.
I am a man, you a woman.
You're heterosexual, too.
I imagine you have
ulterior motives?
- At this time, there was only
illegitimate couples.
- Yeah.
It's not bad. couples dine,
lovers lunch.
It's nice.
- Yeah.
Womanisers at work.
- What is worse, this.
2 glasses of white wine.
- No, I'll take
tea. Thank you.
- A tea?
- I do not know if coming
was a good idea.
- You think I'm ugly
is it?
- I don't think you're ugly.
I think you're original, different.
- Yes, well, intriguing.
The guy a little cold.
I can be indifferent.
This is my problem.
It's complicated. You arrive, and I
devised three different entrances.
- Which?
- Something amnesiac
another where we fight ..
One .. I tell you
that I love you.
And after ...
After I stopped.
Since you arrived, I'm embarrassed, and I
don't know how..
It is difficult, because it is
in a ratio of seduction.
- Not at all.
Not at all.
We vomited together.
This is so despicable
that there is no seduction.
I can finally see a man
or which is a not a former or future.
- I do not understand.
- You'll be my only friend man
if you want to.
- Oh yeah.
As a gay,
but straight.
- You do not believe it?
- I believe in things
that exist.
The friendship between men and women,
is ...
It is like the wind.
We talk, but there is not.
- Do not bother
to be so.
- Okay, we won't see each other.
Moreover, I will ..
.. Remove your number.
Like this ...
- I'll do it too.
Finally ..
..I will do it at home. Bye.

- Of course, of course.
You know me.
* - Cool.
See you later.

You re-run

You play with
your balls, OK?
Jessica, look at me.
You're French. Look at me,
mouse. No, do not smile.
Do not look at me.
You're a sculpture, forget me.
You gotta kiss Jimmy.
You're packing.
You're a bitch, a hottie.
Have you ever kissed the other 3.
Now it's Jimmy.
And you shall eat the mouth.
You packed.
You gotta go
like that. Look.
I want to see the language.
Tilt your head.
You open well. You leave the tongue
and I want it to be hot.
We are all motivated?
Marc coughs.
- Your colleagues
look nice.
- Look, Jessica.
You kiss him like this.
Go.
You understand?
- I'm not sure
they understood.
You do not understand.
They have not understood.
Earlier,
when I've insulted ..

I thought not.
If we do it again,
do you mind?
- I do not know.
- With you, life
has a taste of guava.
Or papaya.
I confuse the two.
What is the difference?
- I do not know.
- This is the 1st time
we made love ..
But .. yet
it's like ...
Don't you think?
- I do not know.
- You're gonna leave
your guy?
- I do not know.
- You want us to be lovers?
- I do not know.
- We'll see you again?
- I do not know.
- Why do you repeat that?
- I do not know.
- Leave him.
Leave him,
please.
Leave him.
- No.
- Why?
- When I am available,
I won't interest you.
And you know it.
- I do not know.
- You see?

Then I read your manuscript.
"Love lasts ..

I love this silly title.
I had a little trouble
to enter it.
But there is a small voice,
a little music.
I do not know if this is desired.
We receive many, novels
small heads slaps.
But all stands.
I'm not sure ..

your priority. But ..

It is a bit pretentious,
muscle up ..

my glass of water. Based.
- Ah.
- Thank you.
As to tenure,
you want what?
- 60000 euros?
- We will see later,
but the answer is no.
I think we
change your name.
- Nobody knows me,
except 30 colleagues.
- It's the 30 critics that
count, and they will demolish ..
.. Your book. How
would you call?
- Yeah. How you spell it?
- Look at these gifts.
Sofa, TV.
Look at the way

Alice does not know.
It is published
under a pseudonym.
- I'm so proud of you.
Come here.
- Okay, okay.
We share a weekend together.
- You tell him,
about the book?
- If I tell her, she will think
I'm misogynistic and leave me.
- She will discovers it.
And then on top of that,
you will pass for a liar.
This is the worst,
for a woman.
- You think so?
- She'll treat you
like shit.
- Well, the Basque country,
is very beautiful.
To be honest, it was mostly what
we could see from the room.

we moved-in.
We saw "re-saw", reviewed, re-reviewed.
Not seen, not seen. Oh yes, yes,
because we went out once.
I gotta talk to you
of something important.
- You're asking me
to leave my husband?
We can not walk
without taking the head?
- I want to talk about something else.
You're with him, or with me?
- There you go again?
- We need you to choose?
When you talk to him, to us?
- My love, why ruin it?
It is there.
Enjoy the moment.
- It cannot continue.
I'm the guy who fills you and
after you go home it blossoms.
- You're going too fast.
I will talk to him,
but give me time.
- Alice, I'm thirty years old,
I want to settle.
Women do not have the monopoly
of the biological clock.
- You wanted to say?

The guy must make
love without feelings.
The thing ...
do we have a train at 16h52?
- Alice.
Alice?
What's wrong?
Its wrong?
What happened to you there?
- I'm tired.
Who is it for?
- The flowers?
My secretary has worked-it out ..
..today, my love ..
It's been 3 years ..
we're together.
That's it.
You do not look well.
- I'm happy.
I'm happy.
- It's going too fast, Alice.
You cannot do this to me.
We made love everywhere, here.
You're not going to leave me for Marc.
This is the ugliest of my cousins.
Physically, it is inconsistent.
You're crazy.
- I'm sorry.
- Pardon,
Gentlemen, ladies.
You are very talented.
In a few nights here ..
You have mastered ..
our dance perfectly.
- Thank you. Your institution
is very welcoming.
- This is very nice,
but we must go.
- Thank you.
- Like that,
like this, like this.
- No, it's ...
- There would be rabbits
at Porte Maillot.
- Really?
- Yes.
I never checked.
- Let's check.
- Oh yeah?
- Yes.
- OK.
I drank.
- I like being drunk with you.
- Really?
- Yes.
- Me too.
Lé, look!
- What is it?
- A terrier.
- It's not ...
Oh, a rabbit flying.
No, it's a pigeon.
We do not want to eat you.
- There is no rabbit.
- Rabbit.
- We lied.
There is no rabbit.
- I'll never forget
this moment.
- We say that
when the holidays are finished.
- Okay. I will almost
never forget this moment.
- I always forget.
- I hate you.
- You disgust me.
- Out of the question
we fall in love.
- Strongly Agree.
- I had to remain anonymous.
- Hello, first.
- Hello.
- It is.
I do not know why,
Your book is a hit.
Everyone wants to see you,
and I ..
Tired to explain ..
you're dead.
You're my only living author
wanting to be known posthumously.
- I do not want to show me.
- What do you mean you do not want?
You're not Daft Punk.
- But ... Emile Ajar
it worked well.
Yes, I know what you're gonna say,
I'm not Romain Gary.
- That's it.
- Wait a minute.
It's going too fast.
And there is a story behind it.
It's not ...
Listening.
It's a bit long
to explain.
I have not spoken to
my girlfriend.
Alice is so beautiful.
The feet, it's a detail.
When we love, we do not care.
It is so beautiful.
I convinced her to leave
her boyfriend to live with me.
- Who cares, about your life.
You're right.
You sit on your 300,000 euros
Copyright?
- I am a cursed poet.
I am above all that.
It's not ...
Alice ...
Wait, you said how much?
- There are how many languages?
You count?
We cannot compete.
In addition, look.
The engine accelerates.
- This is to replace us.
- To all the shots.
Ah, you have Tenga.
- We have a small amount.
- This is good.
- It sells well.
It keeps difficulty.
You know?
- Yes, I know.
- This is great.
- It avoids the flowers,
the restaurants.
- It suits you.
It should be taken.
The Tenga ..
It's like .. sex
woman in a box.
- Perfect to
replace Kathy.
- What?
- Remove, I understand.
- Kathy?
- Oh shit.
Say anything to Pierre.
But it's over.
- But ...
- She spoke English,
it excited me. It happen again.
It's okay.
- This is serious,
that you didn't mention to me.
Finally ...
It would appeal to Alice?
I'm in love.

* Some say that
Jean d'Ormesson.
- Ah.

to teach me my job.
- I'm wary.
- That's what I say.
- The prix de Flore
is awarded to Feodor Belvedere..
For his book .. ..
.. "Love lasts three years."
- It is not me, I'm
the editor of Feodor.
He wrote a message
he asked me to read.
Write like a pig.
"Thank you so much."
Not very original.
"I am extremely
touched by this award.
"Especially since I'm not
an dead old Russian..
.. "But a young author living."
- It's not you,
anyway?
- Of course not.
- "In this room ..

No, it's not me.
This is not me.
This is not me.
No, it's not me.

Marc, Marc!

Judette. Judasse.
Editor.
- My son!
You know,
Yulya loved your novel.
It is not Tolstoy '
but he likes it.
- This is a nice book.
- Thank you.
- It is you who ..
Purchased the jury ..?
- No, it's free.
- It's too much, it.
How much it will bring him?
- It depends.
- Great. But
there are still taxes.
We go?
At any hour.
- Your father is
always?
- This is not my father,
but me in 30 years.
- It happens.
Good evening.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
What's going on?
- I love what you do.
- Ah.
- We're happy
it is you.
- Finally.
- Want me to put?
- Your number,
eg.
- Ah.
What's going on?
We go for the weekend?
- Feodor Belvedere is
anagram of "I'm an idiot?"
- I said that it was not me ..
.. All night.
- stop ..
.. lying.
The most misogynist book
Of the year.
The author begs me, told me with
me, life has a flavour of pineapple.
- From Dad)
- We talk about the same.
You're a crook to your readers ..
Or .. for me.
So we leave here,
because I do not need a crook.
- I wanted
to tell you earlier.
I wrote this
before I met you.
- This was after your divorce
and you were married at the funeral.
- No, not at all.
I was with ...
I was someone else,
you changed me.
- Yeah?
- Yes.
- Here you go change girl,
because I hate bad faith.
- You're jealous of my success?
- In fact, you're still
more stupid as your book.
- I apologise for writing
bestsellers?
- You're a shit.
And your title is wrong.
With you, it lasts less
and it is not love.
Needless to say that it is
the last time I see you.
- I'll miss you.
And shit.
- If she came out naked
at that time the ...
- Coffee. Cognac.
- What's going on?
- This is not
a thunderbolt.
- Yes
- Too bad Alice is not here.
- Exactly she probably
will never return.
- Ah.
- It's over.
- It'll be my fault.
- Like father,
like son.
Rabbits are not otters.
- I thought so.
I told you, Yulya.
Marc has something ..
.. To tell me.
- Alice searched
in your phone?
- This is because
of my book.
That's it.
- Come, let's talk.
- But we never did that.
- You must take me for an
hedonistic old fart.
When your mother left me,
I never recovered.
And since, well,
I'm having fun.
Have you ever tried Cialis?
- I want to know.
- Wait.
Life goes on.
I divorced 40 years.
Now, I'm nearly 70.
I can tell you that sexually ..
I still ..
under the hood.
- Super.
- Just yesterday evening ..
I beat up .. small.
And several times this week.
- No details.
- Your dad is tough.
- Here we go again.
- Our bed is
the greatest ..
Tent .. the world.
- I hear you!
- It's very nice.
Thank you and goodbye, Francoise.
You think it's over,
with your news?
- You know the books
wreak havoc around.
- You have a name?
- Juliet. Your book
saved my life.
I can kiss you.
- No, thank you.
If she loves you,
You can recover.
Here, Francoise.
- Me its Juliet.
- Thank you and goodbye, Juliette.
- Above all, continue.
- Count on me.
- Hello,
I am Claudine.
- When I was born, you both
left. So it has rubbed off on me.
We must not look for
the culprit far.
- But do you hear?
"Love lasts three years,
it is moms fault."
How old are you, Marc?
With your father, it was love.
Well, that was another era.
If you really love this ...
- Alice.
- If you like it, go ahead.
Charge. Do not give-up
before you fight.
I've learned
to give up?
Look at my life, my books ..
And .. when I conquered
My breast cancer.
All this is achieved
without a fight?
What is this generation
guys who whine everywhere?
We're real women,
we want real ..
Men ..,
not soft balls.
- Okay, fine.
Thank you for your advice.
I will summarize
between you and Dad.
Between Cialis and soft balls,
I'll work it out.
- Make it so.
- Excuse me, ladies.
- Christelle.
- It's pretty, Christelle.
- I thought about her every night,
and drank to forget.
With the opposite effect.
A glass
please.
Thank you.
You see, it's there.
It is there.
It is there.
It is there.
It is there.
It's everywhere.
Alice.
Success allows me to sleep
with anyone ..
And .. anyone can
sleep with me.
- You talk alone?
You got to stop drinking.
I did not think
it would work with you.
The guy from the Goncourt was simple,
He was 80 years old. I was desperate.
- And the Medicis?
- It was very boring,
no humour, not like you.
You're super funny.
- And the Femina?
- Nice.
In bed, not great, but nice.
On the contrary, the Nobel
what a blow ..
.. Hell.
I recommend it to all.
.. My girlfriends.
- You like Michel Legrand?
- Who?
- I rarely had
conversations ..
So .. interesting.
I'm upset.
When I
in this state of profound exchanges, ..
.. I have to take the air,
order to follow, if we take.
I suggest you start ..
.. Monogamous sexual activity,
with yourself.
When you're at room temperature,
I'm back.
OK.
Jean-Georges, it's me.
Come save me.
I helped you once,
then you gotta help me here, very fast.
Very, very quickly.
She's really gone?
- The prepubescent? Yes.
I put her in a taxi.
- No, Alice.
She left a t-shirt.
- How wonderful.
- Yeah.
her fragrance.
Her scent.
- Are you kidding here?
What are you doing?
- Leave me alone.
Let me.
I want to die.
Where is the window?
- Wait till I'm gone.
Well, thank you.
Oh, fuck.
- Have you ever suffered
for love?
We know.
You know I've never loved.
- I envy you. I have had
enough, to be in love.
- The scent makes your
Head spin?
Wait, it is I who envy you.
I have always suffered from it.
I would like to know
what you're going through.
- I'm a misogynist?
- I'm not very well
placed to respond.
But I knew
the book would not happen.
Go, good night.
- It is the fault of the book.
- Please.
Silence.
I meant
all my friends gathered here ...
Stop putting
hands everywhere.
While we're married ..
.. But not dead.
If you want
invite us to parties, ..
Costume .. or without costumes ..
It is .. in 2012
and this is not the end of the world.
We continue to offer
things.
To me alone, alone
or whatever you want.
We are open to all.
- I would say that I am
happy because I became a husband.
But mostly, I would say
thanks to Kathy, ..
.. I reproduced.
People applaud.
A new "me"
is running.
- A new "we"
is running.
- I love this crazy. That's it.
Without a common language, I
understand the evening when she said ..
.. "Oh fuck!" ..
Or .., "Oh, God.
Oh, God. ".
I love you.
- Come on, Marc.
- I'll make a speech.
It is the purpose of the witness.
- Happy witness.
- Well, thank you.
You take the words of my mouth,
because we are all happy for you.
Who would not,
against this team ..
Rehabilitating before ..
the collective unconscious.
The couple formed ..
..by stuck-up nerd
.. and housewife nymphomaniac.
But ..
.. I would like to say,
our beloved couple ..
And .. all the assembly
of freeloaders is that ..
What .. you applaud,
there is no love.
No, it is an advertisement.
Perfectly
a commercial page.
When do we eat the most?
At breaks,
and meetings.
Incredible.
It is at this time the ..
Change apartment,
car, TV.
Let me.
I know what I'm saying.
Let me testify
The Witness !
- You're too long.
- society does not need love.
it needs a flock ..
..of consumers like you
with your forks and knives.
Love ..
.. Not last 3 years
does not last an hour ..
Or 3 seconds .. because to last
it should exist.
That's all I meant.
But I have a gift.
Since love
is a lie ..
Might as well cover..
with elegance.
For once,
I went to Kabul.
And I found it.
- You're not funny.
- The method ..
Taliban ..!
Loyalty couple.
With it, ..
If your partner ..
not last ...
Bhoo
What?
You know. Shut up!
You are pathetic.
You are pathetic!
Hello?
I give a damn,
your happiness. Fuck.
It's over, Alice.
It is finished.
Well, I'm going.
* I really have to go.
You'll see me again.
* Alice. Alice!
* Alice.
- Shut up.
* - You're fucking?
* Yes, I can hear,
Someone screwing you.
- He has no self-esteem.
He will continue.
* - Yes, Antoine.
You have a micro penis.
* incapable to pleasure
a smurf. incapable!
- You
who told him that?
- Not at all.
- Did not you say that?
- No.
- This is not true.
- No. Not at all.
- When is it a micro penis ..
..compared to
a small penis?
- It is not
the size that counts.
- Why do you say that?
You would say it to him?
At the other there.
- I would say not.
- Why do you tell me?
- I do not know
I try to reassure you.
- Reassure me?
I have a micro penis?
- No, not at all.
- It is not big,
but not micro.
- This is not micro.
It is between the two, normal.
- Alice.
All it can do a little
staging, ..
And .. Normally, I am against
the ritual of love letter.
Especially when I'm dropping
without warning.
But I wanted to reconstruct
Through writing what she broke.
What I wanted to tell Alice
was very simple.
I think about it in the morning ..
.. Evening ..
In the street .., ..
.. Walking in the cold.
I did express
walking slowly ..
To think of it ..
longer.
- Poor idiot.
- I announced Alice that
I wait every night ..
..at 7:00pm, where she kissed
for the 1st time.
- Mytho.
- Guest of the Grand Journal
Marc Marronnier, ..
That .. was awarded the Prix de Flore.
Hi, Marc Marronnier.
Do you ..
Love that ..
last 3 years?
- Clarification, ..
Nothing .. you invented.
In the oriental literature, ..
Tough love .. no more
1001 nights.
- If we calculate
1001 nights, it's ..
...guessing, 2745 years.
That's it.
This is a technical debate.
In Tristan and Isolde, you know
how long the filter lasts ..
of Love ..?
- 3 years?
- Oh yeah.
Alice, I ...
- It is Ali.
- I'm not talking to him.
Alice ..
I .. ...
I love you.
- But what does he do?
Oh, fuck!
Cunt.
Phone
- Yes, gone?
* - We talk to you
the Grand Journal.
- Really?
* - Yes, you'll see.
* - Not too long.
* - Alice, you take me
for a childish moron.
* - She is not alone.
- I ...
I am hallucinating.
- Love alters not
in hours ..
* .. But survives
until the end of time.
* If I am proven
wrong ..
* .. I've ever written,
nobody has ever loved.
* "Nor I never ..
* .. "Writ,
nor I ever loved. "
* - It's not you.
* - It could.
- He is crazy.
* - If it looks ...
* Alice, I know
you despise me.
* You will be right, because it is
media manipulation for you.
* But thanks to you,
I know that love is a gamble ..
* .. It's like
faith in God.
* You have vampire teeth,
and very original feet...
* Have you ever been in love.
Really stupid.
* What I'm trying
to say ..
* .. Is that I got bored
all my life, but never with you.
* This book ..
* .. Which poses many problems
us ..
* .. This is the cry of a man
suffering ..
* .. Not to have met you.
- It is unbearable.
Unbearable.
* - I remember ..
* .. The title of the novel ..
* .. "Love lasts three years."
* Immediately ..
* .. The after-sales service.
- Marc Marronnier is where?
- He's gone from there.
- Taxi.
- Marc!
Marc.
I love you.
I love you.
- So?
We go?
My meter is running.
I am busy.
- No, I am not
injured at all. Not at all.
Not injured.
Not bad, not bad.
"No man never writ,
nor no man ever loved. "
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
- Great,
this depression.
I would have never thought of.
Very good idea.
- I'm not well
I suffer there.
- The scope of the declaration
live TV, this is ..
.. Awesome. It was daring.
- But it has sprung.
I did not understand love.
- That's what I always thought.
But bravo.
- I want to start
to zero.
I want to make
a documentary about love.
- I have another idea.
Friends make a home of
writer in Australia.
Can I encourage
you to go.
You can stay 18 months
as you want.
- You get rid of me?
- I say this for your own good.
- That's what worries me.
- Today we love
love more than human beings.
This love is killer love
in my opinion.
- When Pascal pronounced love
of love, I find myself.
Love must be subtracted from love
of love. Of course.
- It is a disease. Terrible.
We do not know why
we found this person.
In my opinion,
love lasts forever.
It lasts maybe 3 years maximum
it's physical attraction.
- This is a lovely theory,
but it is not serious.
Everyone knows that
orgasmic power..
of women is ..
are men.
So it does not concern us.
This is bullshit.
Bullshit.
- The best way to prolong
love is to practice it.
I always recommend it to
the church ..
Saying that we should come only..
when fruitful.
We should come especially
outside these times.
Female Marmoset ..
When they see ..
that their husbands..
..are stolen.,
go to work.
So I would say
that the slogan is ..
.. "If you want
your husband to be faithful ..
.. "Or conversely, fuck.".
- There is also
love-friendship ..
.. Love-attachment,
Love-kindness.
Also, the love of parents for
children that does not last 3 years.
Or, if this is not the case,
little-ones are in trouble.
There are several kinds of love,
and we must remember that to Marronnier.
His theory, also
is extremely striking.
- Marronnier annoys me because ..
..there is a lot of certainties.
Statistically
it may be, ..
But .. I think you can not ..
Talk ..
statistically love.
- So?
- It's boring.
- You do not know anything.
Why I ask?
Greece that I can go
Melbourne to write.
It's a little conceptual
but it is not boring.
- You go when?
- Soon, why?
- I have something to tell you.
- Nothing serious?
- I want
You to be my witness.
- Oh no. You're not gonna join.
- Do not look like this.
I must tell you.
In fact ...
It happened some kind of,
click.
I cannot explain it.
I think
that must be it, love.
I took
surfing lessons.
- Breathe.
The guy comes,
a species ..
.. Blond.
everything I hate.
More beautiful than me.
- Bent.
- And then something happened.
- Feel the balance.
- something happened
.
- You've done surfing.
- You make me hot.
- Yeah, too.
What is happening to us?
- I do not know.
That ever happened to me.
- You have a depressed look.
- What?
- You have a depressed look.
Women, are like tobacco,
..you need to stop.
- You may be right
In addition, I have good taste.
.. Fagot.
I like Proust, Visconti, ..
.. Lady Gaga.
Ah.
- We're not fags, us.
We are not
pansies.
We are just tired
of bitches.
- Okay, but ...
Finally ...
- What?
- What?
- When you are together,
both ..
.. Naked
night ...
At one point, you ...
- Wait, stop.
It is good, but ..
This .. is mutual.
- Ah?
- This is different.
We are in love.
This is love.
My friend, the priest,
Vanish Le Tallec, ..
.. Just here to connect us
with the great All.
- Vanish Le Tallec,
the guru comes out ..
Prison ..?
- Why do you judge?
- Would you pay?
I finished my service.
I'm going
to the beach.
Alone.
- You've already made
love today?
- Yes
But I'm not tired.
- Hedonism.
- I drink something.
You want something?
- No, thank you.
- There are many
degrees of alcohol?
No.
Oh no ...
No! Fuck!
- Welcome to the family.
- Health friends.
- Health.
Pass the man drink.
I'll leave this,
It's for bicycle pumps.
- Yeah.
What is it?
- Pork Gascon.
- It looks good.
- nicely rose
soon cooked.
- What?
It can jump
generations.
- My great-grandfather
was béké.
* All men think
They know love.
* But we all know
love is a mystery.
* Such a union ..
* .. Is rare, miraculous ..
* .. And sacred.
- Long live the newlyweds.
* - Jean-Georges, Steve
I have a surprise for you.
- Do not ruin it.
* - No, I think
My gift will please them.
- Do not be stupid.
- Taxi.
Take me there, please.
* - Ladies and gentlemen,
Jean-Georges and Steve ..
* .. For you, great,
the gigantic ..
* .. The greatest composer in
the world, a living legend ..
* .. My absolute idol ..
* M. .. Michel Legrand!
- I ran from Paris
I point out.
- I, too,
since I know you.
- I was right,
you are in love.
- Especially her.
- Especially him.
- Especially her.
- Especially you.
Me, not at all.
It's just sex.
But your theory
credit of 3 years ...
If we do not see each other
for 3 months I met a model.
Extension of.. 3 months?
- Yes. Well, no.
Who cares.
I think it would be good not to leave.
It would be nice.
- Oh yeah?
- Yes.
- Okay, but how far?
Until February 20,
or until May 7?
I do not understand well.
It changes everything.
- It's going to be okay.
- We count from
the first orgasm.
- They have not yet started,
it looks like two turtles.
- There are more years.
- But people.
- I feel this love story
is charming.
Especially since this ... Whats
her name? Alice here.
She is a potential troublemaker,
so it can last.
- No need to be two to love.
I love you, you love me.
- Exactly.
- That's it, love.
- I leave you, Ingrid.
I kiss you.
If Marc dropped her soon
We have the second volume.
Before the summer,
this is the jackpot.
- I count the years
that remain.
- What do you say?
- No, nothing.
My love.
- Alice? I know
even who he is.
It is so well
with Svetlana. Okay?
Svet and I
this is for life.
- It will be 3000 euros.
- 3000,
anyway.
- You think I like
small school kids. Not at all.
These are DéliChoc.
- It should marry.
With me, he was too young.
There is good.
- That's good, " lé, it is good."
It can make a good title.
