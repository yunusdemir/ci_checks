<i>This is a story</i>
<i>about two kingdoms</i>
<i>side by side,</i>
<i>but worlds apart.</i>
<i>All along the border</i>
<i>magical flowers grew.</i>
<i>Primroses bloom
between light and shadow.</i>
<i>They are used to make love potion.</i>
Because after all
<i>everybody deserves to be loved.</i>
Ooh!
Whoa!
Okay...
<i>Wise men say</i>
<i>only fools</i>
<i>only fools rush in</i>
Oh!
<i>But I can't help</i>
<i>falling in love with you</i>
<i>shall I say</i>
<i>would it be
would it be a sin</i>
sorry.
<i>That I can't help</i>
<i>falling in love with you</i>
What?
Primroses.
Oh, no. I didn't mean to.
I'm leaving. I'm leaving.
Was she trying to get a primrose petal?
We better tell him.
He's not gonna be very happy.
Let me handle it. I'll tell him.
Good idea!
Sire! News from the border!
- You tell him.
- Huh? Okay.
A fairy flew into our forest.
- What?
- And almost took a primrose.
A primrose?
I hate this time of year.
Spring.
Send more goblins
to cut down every primrose.
No primroses, no potion.
No potion, no love.
Because love
is dangerous.
It weakens, it rots.
It destroys order.
And without order, what is left?
Chaos.
Destroy the primroses!
Or I will destroy you.
- Whoa.
- Stuff.
Griselda. Ooh!
- I need your help.
- No.
You know how your boss, my son,
is making everyone miserable
with his ban on love?
No.
Don't you want to see love
return to the dark forest?
- No.
- But I found him the perfect...
I told you to stay out of the light!
Roland! Oh, thank goodness!
Whoa!
Aren't you supposed to be
getting ready for our wedding?
<i>I will. Lam!</i>
Oh, wait! I have something for you!
For me? Why, aren't you
just the sweetest...
Whoa!
Marianne? You're in a plant.
You can't look at me! I forgot.
Bad luck on our wedding day.
Well, too bad you can't
see me.
My hair is doing that thing we both love.
Ahh! Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Were you in the dark forest?
No! Maybe. Yes.
- You could've been killed.
- No! Don't look.
Or worse, seriously disfigured.
Hey! I can take care of myself.
That is no place for a princess.
Oh, yeah? How about
a princess that can do this?
Marianne, don't play with...
Wow!
Who's the big girl?
You got a sword. Yep.
Okay.
Yeah, but I don't need a sword.
Because when I rule this kingdom,
I'll go into that dark forest
to talk to them.
To make it so, at long last,
we're not scared anymore.
That is so sweet.
And then we can all go
anywhere we want
to have fun, to see things,
to have adventures!
I'll be your adventure.
Come on, marianne,
my future queen.
Aw...
- My future king.
- Yeah...
King. I'll have an army. Ooh!
- Yeah. Wait, what?
- Parry. Lunge.
Um...
To protect the fairy kingdom, and you,
- my little buttercup.
- Mmm.
Now, go get yourself all prettified.
Today has got to be perfect.
Chipper! Let's ride.
Marianne!
- Marianne!
- What?
- Remember the wedding?
- I know.
- We have to get ready!
- I know.
- What's with your hair?
- I know.
- We don't have much time!
- I know!
Ugh! What's that?
A boutonniere.
Oh! I forgot to give this to roland.
- You can't give him that.
- Why not?
Uh, he's too good-looking?
Yeah.
- I'll fix that.
- Thanks, sis.
Ew!
Dawn!
Do you think that roland loves me
as much as I love him?
Oh, marianne.
How could he not love you?
You're so
totally loveable!
Really?
I wish you could see how you look.
Oh,
you're looking crazy in love
<i>he's got you looking crazy in love</i>
<i>yeah, you're looking crazy in love</i>
<i>looking so crazy, got you
looking so crazy in love</i>
- It's perfect.
- You're welcome.
I wanna give this to him now!
Isn't it bad luck if he sees you...
<i>Oh, I</i>
<i>can't help</i>
<i>falling in love with you</i>
uh-oh.
<i>Uh-oh, uh-oh</i>
<i>as the river flows</i>
<i>surely to the sea</i>
<i>darling, so it goes</i>
<i>some things</i>
<i>are meant to be</i>
Oh, yeah
<i>somethings are meant to be</i>
<i>- take my hand.
- Oh, take my hand</i>
<i>- take my whole life, too.
- Take my whole life, too</i>
<i>For! Can't help</i>
<i>falling in love with you</i>
<i>Oh, you're looking crazy in love</i>
<i>he's got you looking crazy in love</i>
<i>oh, you're looking crazy in love</i>
<i>looking so crazy, got me

<i>oh, you're looking crazy in love</i>
<i>he's got you looking crazy in love</i>
hey! Marianne!
<i>Oh, you're looking crazy in love</i>
<i>And I can't help it</i>
<i>no, I can't help it</i>
<i>I can't help it</i>
<i>- and no, I.
- I</i>
<i>- can't help.
- No, I can't help</i>
<i>falling in love</i>
<i>with you</i>
<i>so crazy, crazy in love, yeah</i>
<i>and no I know I can't help</i>
<i>no, I</i>
<i>falling in love</i>
Roland!
I am so
not getting my army.
Marianne?
Marianne?
Dawn.
What happened?
I...
I don't wanna talk about it.
Not even to me?
I can't.
- I'm sorry.
- But wait.
Wait!
Tell dad
- the wedding's off.
- The wedding's off?
<i>What do you get
when you fab' in love?</i>
<i>A guy with a pin to burst your bubble</i>
<i>that's what you get</i>
<i>for all your trouble</i>
<i>I'll never fall in love</i>
<i>again</i>
<i>what do you get when you kiss a boy?</i>
<i>You get enough germs to catch a fever</i>
<i>then straight away
he'll up and leave you</i>
<i>I'll</i>
<i>never fall in love again</i>
<i>no, I'll never fall in love again</i>
<i>don't tell me what it's all about</i>
<i>all about</i>
<i>'cause I've been there
and I'm glad I'm out</i>
<i>out of those chains
those chains that bind you</i>
<i>that is why I'm here to remind you</i>
<i>here to remind you</i>
<i>what do you get
when you give your heart?</i>
<i>You get it all broken up and battered</i>
<i>yeah, that's what you get</i>
<i>a heart that's shattered</i>
<i>I'll never fall in love again</i>
<i>no, I'll</i>
<i>never fall in love again</i>
<i>no, I'll</i>
<i>never fall in love again</i>
Dawn!
Dawn! Where are you?
- Dawn!
- The coast is clear.
Shh! She'll hear you.
Whatever happened that wedding
day must have been really bad.
Yeah, bad.
Because now she's always
hovering, watching, worrying.
What's she trying to protect me from?
You can take care of yourself.
Yeah. So...
- Spring ball.
- Yeah.
- My first dance.
- Yeah!
What's your plan?
I made it so when the music starts,
you'll "accidentally" bump into hadrian.
Ooh!
Oh! Today is gonna be so exciting!
Mmm. It already is.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- What?
Hadrian?
Yeah, hadrian. The guy with
the great, red, wavy hair.
No, no, no.
I don't have a crush on him.
I really like Nathan.
Okay. I gotta find hadrian,
tell hadrian to stand in a new place,
find Nathan and tell him
to stand in the old place
hadrian was standing in.
- What if he doesn't like me?
- What?
Snap out of it! Listen.
Like I always say...
<i>Don't worry</i>
maybe he thinks I'm too perky.
<i>About a thing</i>
or dance funny?
<i>'Cause every little thing
is gonna be all right</i>
or my hair is too poufy?
<i>Don't you worry
about a thing</i>
<i>about a thing</i>
oh, 'cause
<i>'cause every little thing
is gonna be all right</i>
all right!
<i>Woke up this morning</i>
<i>smiled at the rising sun</i>
<i>three little birds</i>
<i>pitch by my doorstep</i>
<i>singin' sweet songs</i>
<i>of melodies pure and true</i>
<i>sayin'</i>
<i>this is my message to you</i>
<i>- oh, don't worry.
- Don't worry</i>
<i>about a thing</i>
- sunny.
- Dawn, I'm trying to sing.
<i>'Cause every little thing
is gonna be all right</i>
sunny.
Yes!
<i>Don't worry about a thing</i>
Sunny?
- What?
- Worry!
No, no, no!
Hey! Watch the ears!
Help!
Help! We've gotta get help!
You're looking at it.
Ahh! Sunny!
Too short to run!
Too young to die!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Marianne! Are you crazy?
Sunny, go right!
Sunny, duck!
Okay!
Dawn, some help here.
What am I gonna do with you?
Sorry.
I didn't know what to do.
Pull your head out of the clouds!
Clouds full of boys.
I can't help it.
You just have no idea
what's going on around you.
It's okay. It's okay, it's okay.
Where's sunny?
- You were in the dark forest!
- I was?
- He was?
- Do you want what happened
to the sugar plum fairy
to happen to you?
- No!
- No, no!
Locked away forever
because she made love potion from...
Primroses!
We have to get out of here now!
That place...
Marianne?
Hello?
Marianne!
We're gonna be late for the spring ball!
You drive me crazy!
We have to get out of here, now.
I just said that.
So, that's how you react
to a near-death experience?
Ugh!
What?
You were both nearly killed.
You make such a big deal
out of everything.
Whoa! I'm a total mess!
We have to get ready for the ball.
Ha! No, you've gotta get
ready for the ball.
Uh, you're going like that?
Good luck being asked to dance.
I'm not dancing.
I'm gonna dance
with the most perfect boy.
And who would that be?
- Aaron?
- No.
Benjamin. Charles. Darren!
No.
- Gordon? Herbert?
- No.
I'm going alphabetical, if that helps.
Hi.
Smile, my dear. Smile.
A real smile.
This is one of my better ones.
You used to love the spring ball.
Dad, I'm just too old for this.
I just want to see the happy
marianne I used to know.
Before the...
The roland misunderstanding.
I'm happy.
I'm happy.
Well, I hope you're happy enough
to dance with your father.
Or someone
even better.
<i>Here I am</i>
roland!
<i>On my knees again</i>
dad!
<i>I'd do anything</i>
he's so romantic.
<i>Just to make it right</i>
I'm so onto that hair thing.
<i>Say you'll understand</i>
never!
<i>I know you can</i>
oh, no, I can't!
<i>Come on, marianne</i>
<i>come on, marianne</i>
you cheated on me, remember?
You left me at the altar, remember?
<i>No matter what people say</i>
<i>it didn't happen that way</i>
<i>She was a passing fling</i>
<i>And not a permanent thing</i>
oh, really?
<i>So I hang my head
oh, I wish that I was dead</i>
I can help with that.
<i>Come on, marianne</i>
hi. I'm dawn.
Come on, marianne.
<i>- Come on...
- Marianne</i>
<i>Say you can understand</i>
<i>my marianne</i>
Ugh! I'm not your anything.
Hey. One little mistake.
Little?
You got a lot of nerve walking in here.
<i>Think you got the best of me</i>
<i>think you had the last laugh</i>
No.
<i>Bet you think that everything</i>
<i>good is gone</i>
hold on there, darling.
<i>Think you left me broken down</i>
<i>think that I'd come running back</i>
well...
<i>Baby, you don't know me
'cause you're dead wrong</i>
okay, slow down there, marianne.
<i>What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger</i>
<i>stand a little taller</i>
<i>Doesn't mean I'm lonely</i>
<i>when I'm alone</i>
<i>what does not kill you makes a fighter</i>
whoa! Watch the face!
<i>Footsteps even lighter</i>
whoa, whoa.
Come on, I mean, seriously.
<i>Doesn't mean I'm over
'cause you're gone</i>
whoa!
<i>Here I am</i>
oh, there you go.
<i>On my knees again</i>
on your knees again.
<i>I'll do anything just to make it right</i>
yeah, right.
<i>Say you'll understand</i>
only too well.
<i>Oh, I know you can</i>
<i>come on, marianne</i>
<i>didn't think that I'd come back</i>
<i>I'd come back swinging</i>
- buttercup.
- Oops.
Cheater, cheater, cheater!
<i>What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger</i>
back up! Back up! Hey!
<i>Stand a little taller</i>
<i>doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone</i>
<i>what doesn't kill you makes a fighter</i>
<i>footsteps even lighter</i>
<i>Doesn't mean I'm over
'cause you're gone</i>
<i>what doesn't kill you
makes you stronger, stronger</i>
don't bruise the jewels!
<i>Just me, myself and I!</i>
<i>What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger</i>
<i>stand a little taller</i>
what are you trying to say?
<i>Well, now it's time to say</i>
<i>goodbye</i>
Bye-bye.
Now, that was fun!
Awkward.
Ugh!
Whoa!
Marianne slammed him pretty good.
Well, so much for being king.
Ouch!
You think I can't be king?
King roland!
Well...
Uh, wouldn't he have to
marry marianne?
Yes, and he will.
All we have to do is
get some of that love potion.
You saying I need a love potion?
- No, no, just kidding!
- It was just a joke.
We gotta go. Just kidding, boss!
Okay.
All I gotta do is visualize.
Visualize.
The crown, sitting right on top...
<i>I wanna
dance with somebody.</i>
<i>I wanna feel the beat with somebody</i>
<i>yeah, I wanna dance</i>
Hi!
<i>With somebody who loves me</i>
- you okay?
- Who, me? Okay?
Yes, I am.
No.
Hey, elf. I know just how you feel.
Yeah. Marianne
slammed you pretty good.
Aw! You got it bad.
I wish there was a way to
make her fall in love with me.
Yeah.
Me, too.
Like, I don't know, maybe
something like a love potion.
Like a love potion!
Great idea!
It is a great idea.
Except only the sugar plum fairy
can make the potion.
She's locked away in the dark forest
and nobody ever
goes into the dark forest!
But I know you can.
But why can't you?
Because I'm big!
My armor, it's too shiny.
I'd be spotted for sure.
If only I was little, like you.
Uh-huh.
And I could blend in. Like you.
I do blend in.
Oh, it would
have been perfect!
Then we both, you know, me and you,
both used the love potion.
<i>- I'll do it!
- You will?</i>
If you stop crying.
What? Oh, I'm much better now.
My plan is perfect!
All I gotta do is find a primrose flower,
get to the castle
where I'll find the sugar plum fairy.
She'll make her love potion
with all the little primrose petals that I...
Man, those goblins work fast!
Uh-oh.
Petal, petal, petal.
Think quick, think!
Ah! Duh.
All right.
A small elf
is in the dark forest.
A small elf is in the dark forest.
Oh! Got it!
Thang! Thang!
What does it mean?
I'm listening.
News from the mushrooms, sire.
- You can tell him.
- You tell him.
He likes you.
Really?
Now I'm waiting!
A tall chef is into shark storage!
What?
Okay, you know how
we sometimes have a shark,
but no place to store it?
Well, a very tall chef
has that very same problem.
Hmm. That doesn't make any sense.
I'll deal with it!
Ahem.
What?
That was close.
A small elf is in the dark forest!
Well, if he's looking for trouble,
He's come to the right place.
Yeah
<i>if he's looking for trouble</i>
<i>just take a look at this face</i>
<i>Because I'm evil</i>
Yeah.
<i>My middle name is misery</i>
<i>yes, I'm evil</i>
<i>so don't you mess around with me</i>
<i>Don't worry</i>
<i>about a thing</i>
<i>'cause every little thing is gonna be...</i>
<i>Woke up this morning.</i>
<i>I hope I woke up this morning</i>
<i>three goblins</i>
<i>sa yin' I'm going to kill you</i>
Oh! Okay, you got me!
Just kill me now. Make it quick.
Hey! Hey, wait a minute.
Did you tie my...
Who are you?
Hmm.
Okay, look, you little thing,
I'm a guy who usually enjoys
a good joke,
even at my own expense.
But right now, I'm not in
a "ha-ha" frame of mind.
I'm in an "ah!" Frame of mind.
Ah!
I am on a very serious mission!
I really gotta find the sugar plum fairy,
The maker of the all-powerful love potion,
and you're holding me back. Ow!
You know where she is?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What?
Oh. Okay.
Wait a minute.
You ain't gonna trick me again, are you?
Good. Because I'm an elf,
and we're very trusting creatures.
So here's me,
trusting you.
Marianne!
Kinda busy.
I deserved that one.
The elves' spring dance
is starting soon.
- I want you...
- After the last dance?
You kidding me?
Oh, marianne.
You're... you're a unique girl.
And roland
may have a few flaws...
Understatement.
But he still loves you.
- He loves the crown.
- But...
- And his hair.
- But, but...
- Not in that order.
- But if not roland,
then there has to be someone else!
No, there doesn't.
Maybe if you got out more often.
Let it go, dad.
You'll be a stronger ruler
with a king at your side.
I'm stronger alone.
I don't want you to be alone.
Dad, I promise
if I find a guy out there
who takes my hand
and looks me in the eye
and I don't want to hit him...
<i>I'll consider it.</i>
But that guy doesn't exist.
Then go to the dance to
help me keep an eye on that
flirtatious sister of yours.
That's my girl!
- Did you find him?
- I thought I heard something.
If you see him, kill him.
I won't fit.
Come on.
She's that scary?
Whoa!
Hello?
Are you the sugar plum fairy?
I expected something more
purple.
Hello?
A primrose?
It is! I brought it so you can...
- Nuh-uh.
- So you can make...
The love potion.
How do you think I got in here?
Shh! Listen, my name is sunny.
The bog king won't listen to me
about what happened on that fateful day.
And I've been locked away for so long.
"That fateful day"?
You were listening! So I'll do it.
- Yes!
- If
you promise to set me free!
What?
- Shake on it?
- Uh...
You can reach in. I can't reach out.
You should see your face!
Oh, wait. I can show you!
Another good one! Wanna see?
- No, no, no.
- Petal.
Plumettes!
Believe you me,
there can be unforeseen consequences.
Like what?
Love
<i>love is strange</i>
uh, now's not the time for a concert.
<i>Many people</i>
shh! Whoa!
Take it for a game
no lookie-loos!
<i>Once you get it</i>
ah!
<i>You're in an awful...</i>
- What did I say?
- No looking... no... mmm-mmm.
<i>'Cause after you've had it</i>
<i>you never wanna quit</i>
if you think making
the potion's dangerous,
wait till you use it.
<i>Love is strange</i>
<i>Love</i>
<i>is strange</i>
oh! I'm so good, it scares me so!
Is the elf taken care of?
- He's a slippery little devil.
- He's just an elf!
- Hi!
- Mom, no.
Oh, relax your thorax.
Feast your eyes on...
- No.
- Maxine's into fungi.
No!
Lakeesha's hobby is killing frogs.
'Mom!
All you need is somebody to...
Don't say it.
What is it with men?
They can't say that word, io...
This is what
I get for carrying you
23 months in my womb?
Promise to stop talking?
Mmm-hmm.
Love!
<i>Once you get it</i>
<i>you're in an awful fix</i>
whoops! I almost forgot the last step!
<i>But after you've had it</i>
<i>you never wanna quit</i>
directions.
Dust the one you love. Stand in front.
Be the first she sees
when she opens her eyes.
Got it. Dust the first eyes you see,
be in the front,
and stand on the one you love!
Now, pull!
- Sunny?
- Yeah?
- I know what set me free.
- Me.
<i>Love is strange</i>
Oh!
<i>Love</i>
<i>is strange</i>
stop!
Sugar plum? She can't be.
Now.
Slowly.
I'm free!
Quiet! We're gonna get caught!
- I'm free!
- Free?
We're still in the dungeon!
- Free!
- Whoa!
Totally nuts.
I'm free. Did I mention I'm free?
Quietly.
- Wait!
- What? Where?
- How did you find me?
- An imp.
The imp? Oh, he wants the potion.
Loves to spread it around
- like goblin dung.
- Ugh!
- Hey!
- What?
Never let this imp
Get that potion!
Okay.
No, no, no.
Thang, sound the alarm.
I'm sorry.
Stuff! Sound the alarm!
Whoa!
- I'm free!
- No, no!
She's free?
I'm free!
Excuse me, coming through. Sorry.
All-righty. Excuse me.
Sunny! Hurry!
Oopsie.
- Ooh!
- Stop that! Shoo! Shoo!
- Gotcha!
- Yeah!
Huh?
- Where did he go?
- He disappeared.
- Can elves disappear?
- If they're magic.
Is he magic?
Well, he disappeared!
Sorry.
- This will never happen...
- No, no, no!
No!
Again.
Sunny!
Om.
Remember what I told you!
Hey! Get off!
Uh-oh.
I'm sorry, but I have to do this!
The plum warned me about you!
Oh, no. Are you okay, little guy?
Little guy?
Oh, good. Bye!
What did you do?
Well, the elf asked me
to make the love potion.
But you didn't have a primrose petal.
And he brought me a primrose petal.
You made the potion?
Just like I did for you
on that fateful day you never
ever, ever let me talk about.
Where is he?
Halfway to the elf festival by now.
Who wants to go to a party tonight?
Yeah!
Booties, prepare to be shaken!
Ha-ha!
Okay, she's here.
Tonight, I surely know, she will love me.
<i>I say, "hey!"</i>
<i>I be gone today</i>
<i>but I'll be back around the way</i>
<i>it seems like everywhere I go</i>
<i>the more I see, the less I know</i>

<i>The kids on the comer

Oh, no! No!
Guards!
- Get him!
- Got him!
My little girl!
Daddy!
- Daddy! Help!
- Dawn!
Oh, no!
I'm sorry, sugar plum fairy.
Where's my potion?
I've been mistreated.
<i>I've been abused</i>
<i>I've been trespassed</i>
<i>and invaded</i>
<i>and I am not amused</i>
dawn! No!
<i>I've been insulted</i>
<i>disrespected</i>
I've been mistreated
release my sister,
you scaly-backed cockroach!
- Whoa.
- Huh?
Return the love potion
by moondown, tough girl.
Or you'll never see your sister again.
I'll have your head on a stick!
Take me instead!
- I took the love potion!
- Sunny!
Then give it back.
I don't have it.
You heard my terms.
By moondown, or all of you will be next!
<i>I've been insulted</i>
<i>disrespected</i>
I've been mistreated
<i>I've been insulted</i>
<i>disrespected</i>
I've been mistreated
A-ha!
Dad?
I forbid you to fly into the dark forest!
Dad, I let this happen!
I have to get her back.
I have to get her back.
I have to keep you safe.
No need to worry.
I will save the princess!
I was just fighting a dozen goblins.
- Roland! Yes!
- Oh, no!
- What do you need?
- I need an army.
- Oh! We can't trust him!
- And weapons!
And a trebuchet!
- Sunny!
- What?
What were...
And a mace. And a crossbow.
What were you thinking?
I don't know.
What do we do? We have to...
Dawn. She's not strong enough.
She's not going to...
I'll rescue her.
No! No, it's too dangerous.
- No, but I can.
- No.
I'm the only one who can.
So what do I do?
You get the potion back.
I'll get my sister!
Marianne!
Looks like I gotta rescue two princesses.
- Sunny!
- What?
If anything happens to my daughters,
I'm holding you personally responsible!
I'm holding you personally responsible!
Uh...
This is all your fault!
You nearly got everyone killed!
Yeah!
I know. I know.
But look.
Dawn, now, she's my best friend.
But she's our princess!
Now, together we must... no, no, no.
Together we will rescue dawn
from the cruel grasp of the dark forest.
Who's with me?
No volunteers?
Pare!
- Thanks, man!
- Um...
Uh-oh.
Bring me
the prisoner.
I get to rip her wings off!
I want the wishbone.
No eating!
Brutus.
Oh!
So, what do we have here?
<i>Sugar pie, honey bunch</i>
what?
<i>You know that I love you</i>
<i>I can't help myself</i>
Huh?
<i>I love you and nobody else</i>
<i>But I'm evil</i>
<i>my middle name is misery</i>
<i>yes, I'm evil</i>
<i>so don't you mess around with me</i>
oh, silly.
<i>Sugar pie, honey bunch</i>
stop that!
<i>You know that I love you</i>
and stop that!
<i>I can't help myself</i>
I'm a sucker
for sweet, pretty singing.
Shut it off! Shut it off!
<i>When I call your name</i>
<i>boy, it starts a flame</i>
<i>Burning in my heart
tearing it apart</i>
the potion. The potion!
We should have taken the feisty one!
Get the sugar plum!
What's he talking about?
I can't hear over that singing!
Uh-uh.
<i>Ooh, I can't help myself</i>
<i>I love you and nobody else</i>
<i>no, I can't help myself</i>
take her!
And lock this crazy creature
in the dungeon!
She is crazy
in love with you!
Do I hear wedding bells?
<i>Sugar pie, honey bunch</i>
I hate princesses.
<i>You know that I love you</i>
- Careful! She's our bait.
- Oh, well...
If I have to look under every rock,
I won't let you die sad and alone.
Bring me sugar plum!
<i>There's no way.</i>
<i>I'm gonna sit this one out</i>
<i>I gotta take a chance now</i>
<i>not be a prisoner of doubt.</i>
<i>I'm comin'</i>
whoa!
Ugh!
Whoo!
Well, you wanted adventure,
and now you got it.
- You ready?
- Oh, yeah.
Take the other side! Wait for my signal!
Now!
- Ahh! Mmm-mmm.
- Huh?
- No, he didn't. Huh?
- Oh, that's nasty.
Oh, man. At least it can't get any worse.
It just did.
Oh! So, your eye seems
to be healing pretty good.
Uh! Okay. Stop that!
Aw!
- Crazy little thing.
- He's kind of cute.
Hey!
I think she likes us!
Come back here!
<i>No,
I can't forget this evening</i>
<i>or your face as you were leaving</i>
Oh, don't let
her sunny sweetness flamflumble you.
Her sunny sweetness flamflumble you.
Not your type.
Now, I've found someone
who is positively perfect for you.
Not now, mother.
<i>Yes, it shows</i>
Eh! I'm not giving up!
Finally.
- Griselda.
- Plum.
It's so amusing how you keep trying.
Hmm, you're one to talk,
with your magic recipe for failure!
Well, the recipe's working now! Isn't it?
Oh, it works.
I need the antidote!
Oh, it works? Pah!
Then explain what happened to this one.
Oh, you have your father's smile!
Wait. I know this song! Cover up!
<i>I can't live
if living is without you</i>
give me the antidote!
And what will you do
if I refuse? Lock me away?
<i>Loan'? Live</i>
I can't live!
Everybody, be quiet!
<i>- Kill me!
- I'll do it myself!</i>
Ooh!
If you don't keep your mouth shut,
I'm going to rip your wings off,
my pretty little fairy princess!
Ha-ha! Flirt!
What is that?
I made it special for you.
For me?
It looks good on you.
Uh, I don't...
- I hope you like it.
- This isn't...
Well, um, thank you.
It's, uh...
It's lovely.
<i>Sugar pie, honey bunch</i>
no, no, no!
<i>You know that I love you</i>
what you're feeling
is the potion, you know!
<i>I can't help myself</i>
no, I suppose you don't.
<i>I love you and nobody else</i>
please, stop!
You must be tired from all that singing.
I could sing forever.
Why don't you take a wee nap?
I promise I won't go far.
Wait!
Please tell me your name.
I am the bog king!
My boggy-woggy kingy-wingy!
"Bog king!"
Boggy kingy-wingy.
- "King!"
'Kingy-wingy
- "king!"
- Good night,
sweet boggy-woggy.
Good night.
News, your majesty!
Quiet! She's asleep.
Sorry. There's reports
of lots of creatures being
love-dusted!
Bring them...
Bring them in.
Bring them all in here.
Ah!
Oh!
There you are!
You go that way. I'm going this way!
Yeah.
Whoo!
Ha-ha!
- Hey, you!
- Hmm?
No, no, no. Not you, Lizzie.
That little thing inside.
We caught you fair and square!
Hand it over!
Hmm...
Oh, yeah, sure.
Go ahead and think.
I'll just wait for you at
the other end of the lizard.
Thanks!
Spit.
<i>This thing called love</i>
<i>I just can't handle it</i>
who's a good girl?
<i>This thing called love</i>
you're a good girl!
Don't you feel special?
<i>I must get around to it</i>
<i>I ain't ready</i>
<i>crazy little thing called love</i>
Okay! Let's go fetch dawn.
Who's a good girl?
In such dark as this,
we must be ever vigilant.
- Clear!
- Clear!
Clear!
Clearing is exactly what we're
gonna do to this foul forest.
- We're gonna...
- Get ya!
Stealthily, we shall sneak up on...
Who would live in this?
Wipe that off, will you?
And, io, a creature with no face.
It's looking at me.
I don't think that's possible.
Good point!
Watch for grotesqueries at every corner.
Imagine the most unimaginable danger.
That's probably nothing.
Whoo-hoo!
Hey, roland!
Thank you!
- Thank you, guys. Thank you.
- Wait, wait!
How did you get that to...
- She fell in love with me!
- Me, too!
Is that wrong?
I got the love potion.
Wow! Yeah, wow!
You must really need that potion.
Wait! I got it for...
Dawn! You got it for
princess dawn. Winky-winky.
And well done, for a little guy.
Squish!
I got it... I got it...
I got it for dawn.
I better take that
to keep it safe.
Thank you, tiny rabbit!
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
It's almost moondown.
Hold on, dawn. I'm coming!
Okay, okay! Yes! I love her!
You know! Ha-ha-ha!
Come on, Lizzie! Let's go!
- Halt!
- Halt!
March!
I lead!
Okay! Okay.
We're gonna get ya!
Help me!
Help!
Mushrooms in love!
Ooh! Kiss me. Quick!
No smooching!
Ugh.
Shush him.
- You shush him!
- You're closer.
You're right. Shush!
So, why don't you go
and get some sleep?
What were you thinking?
- Don't hate me.
- Too late.
And leave me alone.
Nice button-ere.
Not "button-ere."
"Boutonniere."
No, it's not "boutonniere."
- It's "button-ere."
- It's "boutonniere."
Okay.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Release my sister.
Oh, no! Not another princess!
Well, at least you're not singing.
<i>I'm coming straight on for you.</i>
<i>I've made up my mind</i>
taking a little break?
<i>I'm feeling strong now</i>
<i>now I'm coming through</i>
well...
- Need any help, sire?
- No.
<i>I'm coming straight on for you</i>
<i>yeah! Straight on for you</i>
impressive!
<i>I'm coming straight on for you</i>
Uh-oh.
<i>Rock-a-bye, fairy
away in your cell</i>
<i>scream your head off
but no one can tell</i>
had enough?
I could do this all day.
But now, give me the potion!
The almighty bog king
needs a magic love potion.
I don't need it! I want to eradicate it!
Well, eradicate this!
- Ask him. He'll appreciate it.
- Okay. Need any help?
No!
Look at you!
Whoa!
Not bad.
- Looks like you need help.
- No!
Ha!
Ha-ha!
Ah-ha!
So, is that all you got?
<i>Now I know</i>
<i>how to play my hand</i>
well, I'm ready for you!
<i>What the winner don't know,
the gambler understands</i>
what does that even mean?
<i>No!
You don't stand a chance</i>
<i>you don't stand a chance.</i>
<i>I'm coming straight on for you</i>
- ooh!
- Ah!
You fight well, for a fairy.
Wish I could say the same for you!
What do you mean?
I don't know. I was expecting more.
<i>Straight on for you</i>
<i>- straight on for you.
- Straight on for you</i>
<i>straight on for you</i>
oh.
Go ahead.
Kill me,
but you won't get your sister.
Need any help?
No!
Wise men say
<i>Only fools rush in</i>
The beast has awoken.
Oh, no.
What did she fall in love with?
Would you care to see?
<i>Falling in love with you</i>
finally.
<i>Like a river flows</i>
see what happens
when love is loosed upon the world?
<i>Fools rush in</i>
<i>would it be a sin?</i>
Ew.
- Tell them to be quiet.
- You tell them.
Your voice cuts through
better than mine.
That's true. Quiet! Everybody be quiet!
Be quiet! Be quiet!
Quiet!
Quiet! Quiet!
Sorry.
I hope you've got a strong stomach.
<i>Sugar pie, honey bunch</i>
<i>you know that I love...</i>
- You?
- Yes.
- Antidote?
- Working on it.
I know she's a girl who falls in love
with every guy she sees,
- but this is ridiculous!
- I, um...
Sire! I forgot to mention,
you forgot your weapon upstairs.
But I found your boutonniere!
- Hi.
- You know,
I really enjoyed our fight,
but I'll be taking my sister home now.
Oh, no, you're not!
Dawn!
- Boggy-bear!
- "Bog king!"
Let's go back to our cell. Shall we?
Anything for you, boggy-woggy.
<i>Uh, “bog .“</i>
don't listen to him!
You are not the boss of me!
And don't even think
about stealing my boggy!
"Bog!"
She stays here
until I get the potion back.
Forget the potion. Get the antidote, now!
Well, maybe you should ask her.
"Her"? Who?
The sugar plum fairy.
- Ooh! Welcome!
- Give me the antidote.
If you let me talk about that fateful...
- No!
- Then, no.
Please! I love my sister.
I need that antidote.
Okay! I'll just need a few things.
What?
An eye of newt, a golden lute,
a loom and a flute.
Get those things.
And green beans,
a nail file, a tangelo...
Hey, will it really work?
Eh, who knows?
- And you are?
- My mother.
Griselda.
Don't you have a comb?
It's drafty down here.
Come upstairs. There's snacks.
- Well...
- Well...
<i>{Got a feeling</i>
it's the best I could do
on such short notice.
<i>That tonight's gonna be a good night</i>
<i>that tonight's gonna be a good night</i>
You two behave.
Toodle-oo!
<i>That tonight's gonna be a good...</i>
Stop.
<i>Night! Yeah</i>
go see if the antidote's ready.
- Roger, b.K.
- And here's your boutonniere.
Quickly!
You sang pretty good.
- You should see me dance.
- I'd love to.
Why would she...
Oh.
Oh!
- Who likes this?
- Not me!
- I hate it!
- I hate it more!
Oh, yeah?
- They're all fools!
- Rushing in.
They can't help it!
They're in chains...
That bind you!
It's nothing but...
Trouble!
It's like their middle name
is misery.
Well...
What's the point?
Bursting bubbles!
- That's what they get.
- Lies
and more lies!
Pain!
Sorrows!
Wait!
I, uh, actually like this one.
Oh! Why?
I... I don't know.
Well, it's...
It's
lovely.
I don't wanna be carrying this.
Antidote's ready, sire.
Well? Where is it?
It's a riddle!
A riddle?
What about all that stuff you asked for?
Well, you know, in prison,
it's hard to shop!
Would you like to hear the riddle, or not?
"No!
'Yes!"
Then listen carefully.
The antidote
is the one thing
more powerful than the potion.
Did she say "antidote" or "anecdote"?
I hate riddles!
The moon is sinking fast.
Can we go maybe a lot faster?
- Halt!
- What?
Oh, wow!
Did you see that?
I believe that is the ugliest creature
I have ever seen!
And it was naked!
An army approaches.
Got it! Yes!
What was that again?
Something more powerful...
Than the potion.
That's what I said.
Sire! News from the mushrooms!
An arm skis on roaches.
Carry on!
- How'd you do?
- I nailed it!
Something more power...
I'm bored! I'll just tell you.
Great!
- If you set me free.
- No!
- Okay.
- Yeah!
Then I will reveal
the antidote with a story.
What? No!
One fateful day,
when the bog king
was young and impetuous,
He fell in love with a sweet young thing.
Ew!
She was the most beautiful creature
I ever saw.
Seriously?
Hmm.
He was so in love.
But bog, he had no patience.
That's enough!
So, he came to me for my love potion.
I tried to tell him how it worked.
But he dusted the sweet,
unsuspecting creature.
Plum, I beg you.
As she was gazing into
the eyes of a lovesick bog...
Even with a love potion,
I'm too hideous to love.
You're not hideous.
Hideous,
not hideous, whatever!
But that's not why the potion didn't work.
What?
She was already in love
with someone else!
So, the one thing
more powerful than the potion
is real love?
Bingo!
That took forever!
Why didn't you tell me?
You shut me away, and you shut me up!
And griselda blames me for
the no-love-in-the-dark-forest!
Teaching moment.
There are no shortcuts to love.
- Just saying.
- Stuff, take it away.
Okay, b.K. Here.
Wait, wait, wait!
Wait a minute!
This antidote won't help dawn.
She's never been
in love with anybody.
I shouldn't have used the potion
on that poor, sweet...
Nothing would have been...
Real.
Well...
I know all about
getting your heart broken.
I almost married someone
who didn't love me.
- Why?
- He was so good-looking.
Oh.
Maybe I couldn't bear to see
that he really was
a shallow, power-hungry,
cheating, chattering, pig son of a...
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Inside, I knew he didn't want me to be...
You?
Yeah.
But you are
different.
I've been told.
That's what I like!
I mean, uh...
Well, you know.
- So, now I keep my guard up.
- Me, too.
And most important, I never...
Trust anybody!
Come on.
Let's go stretch our wings.
Good idea! Good idea. Yes.
Here.
Thank you.
Hmm, maybe you should
rethink this entrance.
Try thinking of this as an adventure!
Nice goblin.
Hey, how about we go back?
Why?
The moonlight is perfect right now.
Come on,
"tough girl."
Uh...
<i>You're waking meadows</i>
<i>in my mind</i>
<i>making waves across my time</i>

<i>I got a strange magic</i>

Oh...
You...
You played me!
"Played you"?
I don't under...
Oh, no.
Oh, no, no, no.
Halt!
Disgusting creatures, I come in peace.
I must get this love potion
To your bog king
by moondown.
I will need only three men.
My army will wait here.
- Sandy.
- It's sunny.
- You're in charge.
- Me?
- Look fierce.
- Uh...
Fiercer!
- Wait!
- I won't be a fool again!
I didn't know!
I wouldn't follow me
if I were you, princess.
You won't want to see what I do to them.
I won't let that happen.
Ugh!
I am so stupid!
Execute plan on my code word, "go."
What kind of odious throne is this?
- Do something!
- Uh...
Hold it, whoa, whoa, hold it, hold it.
I'm here to give you this.
That is, once you've given me...
Get the princess.
You mean
the princess-es...
Roland! What are you...
- Restrain her!
- No!
Oh! Hey!
He brought you the potion!
Yes. And an army!
Well...
You got me to leave my castle.
Clever girl.
But wasn't that your idea?
It was your idea!
And foolishly, I trusted you.
Wait a minute. Are you...
Are you actually having
a lovers' tiff right now?
That is so disgusting!
It's interesting but disgust...
Roland, you are such a...
Hero, to rescue you from...
What did you call him?
A scaly-backed cockroach.
- Is that the guy?
- Ugh.
Hey, pare, I can't stand it anymore.
I have to go find her. You're in charge.
Uh...
What's going on?
Whoa!
Dawn! Are you down here?
Hey, sunny! You didn't listen!
What? Oh!
I said, "stand in front!
Be the first she sees when she..."
Please tell me where dawn is.
Okay, okay, I'll show you,
if you let us all out.
Which would be so sweet,
since this is all your fault!
Okay.
Yay!
My boggy-woggy kingy-wingy.
Oh... I wish I didn't see that.
This isn't...
I didn't mean for
any of this to happen.
Of course, uh,
I will be taking both princesses.
That wasn't the deal.
No!
Deal's off.
Ugh. I wanted a wedding,
now I'm getting a funeral.
You leave my boggy alone!
- Hey! Oh!
- "Bog."
What were you thinking?
A beast like you
falling for a beauty like marianne.
Who's the beast?
Stay out of it!
Hey! I can take care of myself!
Two against one?
Not fair.
Roland! What are you...
Ah...
Let her go!
You're forcing me to change my plan.
<i>So,</i>
sadly, now's the time for me to
90!
Come on! We gotta hurry!
Oh, no.
Boy, oh boy, oh boy!
Keep it moving!
Especially you, turtle!
What is happening?
- No!
- Marianne!
- I have to find your sister.
- Okay.
And my mother.
My life is flashing before my eyes.
Hey, I used to be hot.
- You?
- No time for chitchat.
Dawn!
Dawn!
Let go!
- Sweetheart!
- I'm gonna skewer your...
You will marry me!
Marianne!
Marianne!
We have to go.
Dawn! I'm coming!
Marianne! Get back!
Go!
Wait! Wait!
Bog!
My son.
Dawn!
Dawn!
You're all right.
You're really all right.
You're all right.
<i>Don't worry

<i>'Cause every little thing

I love you.
Me?
You.
Mmm.
Are you
back?
Yeah.
But I don't know how.
I know.
I'm sorry.
- Yahoo!
- He's alive!
Bog!
My precious boy!
Ow!
Out of the way. Move! Move!
King coming through.
Whoo-hoo!
- No!
- Marianne!
No! No, no, no!
Patience.
Ugh!
Here we go.
<i>Sugar pie, honey bunch</i>
- what?
- Marianne?
<i>You know that I love you</i>
that's what I wanna hear.
<i>I can't help myself</i>
of course not, babycakes.
<i>I love...</i>
Whoa!
Ooh! It didn't work.
I wonder why.
Gosh, is that great!
I like that smell.
- Aftershave?
- No.
- Is that cologne?
- No.
Well, boys, I've learned
a valuable lesson.
Never judge something or someone
by how it or he or she
looks.
An elf!
- Wait. Body lotion?
- No.
- Cold cream?
- No.
Ah! Got it! Deodorant.
It's perfume.
Nah. Are you a girl?
- Isn't it obvious?
- Huh?
It's kind of subtle.
Are you okay?
I'm fine. Um...
Wings, shoulders, head,
all good.
- You?
- I'm good, too.
I just wanted to say,
I'll never see this place
the same way ever again.
Yeah.
Here.
It's hideous, but...
Yeah.
Then, um...
Bye!
Whoa!
I didn't mean to sound so cute.
Cute actually works for you.
- You know...
- Yes?
Feel free to visit whenever you like.
Oh. Okay.
Please don't sing!
- You know what, bog?
- "Boggy."
It's never going to work between us.
- Well...
- Shh! It's not you, it's me.
- No problem.
- Yeah. No problem at all.
Marianne, a word.
I smell romance.
I hate that you always hover
and watch and worry!
I'm sorry?
But I love that you came to this forest
to save me.
So, now, I get to lecture you.
Huh?
<i>I know something about love</i>
<i>you've gotta want it bad</i>
<i>if that guy's got into your blood</i>
