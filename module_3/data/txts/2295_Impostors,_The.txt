I'M SORRY.

I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.
I THOUGHT...
WHY IS HE DYING?
I DIE.
TODAY IS MY DAY TO DIE.
I WAS REALLY,
REALLY CONFUSED.
AAH!
DID YOU THINK THAT YOU
WERE SUPPOSED TO DIE?
I WAS CONFUSED.
UH...
I WAS UNSURE,
AND I MADE A CHOICE.
AAH!
AAH! I'M HIT!
BUT DIDN'T YOU SEE
THAT I WAS DYING?
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!
I DID, I DID, BUT...
I DID, BUT--

ARTHUR...
IT WAS JUST BECAUSE
YOUR--THE PAUSE...
WAS JUST SO LONG.
AAH!
AAH!
AND GOOD.
AND GOOD.
IT WAS SUCH A GOOD
LONG PAUSE
THAT I WAS JUST
UNSURE.
I BECAME UNSURE.
WELL, IT FELT GOOD.
OH, NO, IT WAS GOOD.
REALLY?
OH, YOU WERE GOOD.
VERY.
WELL, THEN, MAURICE,
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

FORTUNATE.OK.
AH, THERE YOU GO.

DISTURBED.
BUT ON A SMALLER LEVEL.
AH, THERE YOU GO,
THERE YOU GO.
SUBTLE AS A SPHINX.
SWITCH.
EXCITED.
THAT'S IT FOR ME.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
NO, MAURICE, I...
I CAN'T.
I'M GOING TO DIE
IF WE DON'T GET WORK.
I'M SO HUNGRY.
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?
I DON'T KNOW.
ARTHUR.
WE MIGHT JUST HAVE TO LOOK
FOR OTHER WORK.
WE MIGHT JUST HAVE TO LOOK
FOR OTHER JOBS.
OTHER JOBS?
BEGGARS CAN'T BE CHOOSERS,
ARTHUR.
ARE YOU CALLING US
BEGGARS?
WE WILL BE
IF WE DON'T GET JOBS.
BEGGARS.
PLEASE, SIR.

LEAVING ME AND MY
MENTALLY ILL BROTHER
HERE TO FEND
FOR OURSELVES.
MURDERED, SHE WAS,
IN HER BED BY
ONE OF HER JOHNS.
YOU SEE, SHE SOLD
HERSELF TO FEED US.
SHE COMPROMISED HERSELF
FOR OUR SAKES,
AND HERE WE ARE,
LEFT ALONE AND HUNGRY
AND HOMELESS.

NEEDS A BRAIN OPERATION,
AND MY GLAUCOMA'S
GETTING WORSE,
AND, SIR, SIR, SIR?

GOOD. NOW, AS YOU KNOW,
THIS IS JUST A FORMALITY.
I WANT YOU BOTH IN THE SHOW.
IT'S JUST A MATTER
OF WHO PLAYS WHAT PART.
YOU MEAN YOU WANT US
IN THE PLAY?
YES, I DO,
AND IF I SAY TOO MUCH,
FORGIVE ME, BUT HAVING WRITTEN
IT AND LIVED IT FOR 18 YEARS,
AND NOW DIRECTING IT
WHILE MY WIFE IS PRODUCING,
I THINK I KNOW IT
PRETTY WELL,
BUT THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING
NEW YOU CAN LEARN, RIGHT?
SO I JUST WANT TO SAY
ABOUT THESE CHARACTERS
THAT THEY ONCE
LOVED EACH OTHER,
BUT NOW THEY HATE EACH OTHER,
BUT UNDERNEATH, LOVE,
BUT ON TOP, HATE.
LOVE, HATE, SO SEE
WHAT I'M SAYING HERE?
YEAH, SURE.
LOVE, HATE,

LOVE--TH-TH-TH--
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY, GO.
OK.
Both: DO YOU WANT
TO BE THE GUY--
DO YOU WANT TO BE THE GUY
WHO DIES FIRST?
IT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME.
WHY DON'T YOU GO?
ARE YOU SURE?
YEAH.
EXCUSE ME.
DO YOU HAVE A PREFERENCE
WHO DIES FIRST?
COULDN'T CARE LESS.
OK. I DON'T CARE.
ACTUALLY,
do you mind if I die second?
Because I'm a little
not ready.
OK, good, good.
OK. Go ahead.
AHEM.
WHAT A FOOL YOU ARE, ALAN.
NO, LATEUR.
YOU ARE A FOOL.
ME HA!
IT IS NOT I WHO IS SOON
TO BREATHE HIS FINAL BREATH.
TRUE, BUT I AM NOT
AFRAID, LATEUR,
FOR WITH THAT BREATH
I WILL INHALE HOPE.
HOPE BECAUSE I KNOW
THAT THERE ARE
OTHERS LIKE ME,
LATEUR,
WHO WILL SOON COME,
AND FROM WHOM A PURE
LIGHT WILL SHINE
AND BLIND THE DEVILS
OF THIS WORLD.
AAH!
AAH!
AHH.
UHH!
OH, FATHER.
UM, NOW SWITCH PARTS.
THAT WAS GOOD.
Arthur:
THAT WAS VERY GOOD.
YELLO.
OH, HI, HON.
KEEP GOING. IT'S MY WIFE,
THE PRODUCER.
HI, HI. WHAT'S UP?
IT'S GOING WELL,
IT'S GOING WELL.
WHAT A FOOL
YOU ARE, ALAN.
I SAID I WAS SORRY,
AND I MEANT IT.
ME HA!
THAT'S WHY I'M NOT GOING
TO BEHAVE LIKE THAT ANYMORE.
WHERE ARE YOU?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH HIM?
YOU WHAT?
YOU'RE SAYING TO ME THAT
YOU'RE LEAVING ME FOR HIM?
THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING TO ME?
WELL, YES,
NATURALLY I'M SHOCKED.
OF COURSE I'M SHOCKED.
DOES THIS MEAN YOU'RE PULLING
YOUR MONEY OUT OF THE SHOW?
NO, NO, I WILL NOT FIND ANYBODY
ELSE TO PUT MONEY IN THIS PLAY.
EVERYONE THINKS
IT'S A PIECE OF SHIT.
WHERE ARE YOU NOW?
BECAUSE I'M COMING DOWN.
I'M GOING TO BITE OUT
BOTH YOUR THROATS.
Maurice: SO I INSULT HIM?
Arthur: YEAH.
TELL HIM YOU THINK
HIS PASTRIES
ARE NO GOOD.
OH, GOOD IDEA.
YEAH. SAY THAT THEY'RE
STALE, ALL RIGHT?
HEY, BUDDY,
YOUR PASTRIES ARE STALE.
RIGHT, BUT DON'T SAY
BUDDY. JUST SAY--
YOUR PASTRIES ARE STALE.
YOUR PASTRIES ARE STALE.
I CAN DO IT.
OK. THEN...
YOU'LL COME
TO HIS DEFENSE.
YEAH, RIGHT. I'LL COME
TO HIS DEFENSE,
AND THEN...
HE'LL REWARD YOU WITH
A CORNUCOPIA OF DELICACIES.
YES, RIGHT.
WHICH YOU WILL THEN
SHARE WITH ME. OK.
ALL RIGHT, GOOD.
BUT BE--
YOU KNOW. OK?
SMALL.
SMALL.
YOU, TOO.
GOOD DAY, SIR.
GOOD DAY.
EVERYTHING IS MADE FRESH?

EVERYTHING MYSELF,
FRESH EVERY DAY.
OH, EVERY DAY.
EVERY DAY. GOOD DAY.
GOOD DAY, SIR.
GOOD DAY.
HOW DO YOU DO?
EVERY SINGLE DAY?
EVERY SINGLE DAY.
WELL...
EVEN THESE CREAM PUFFS
ARE FRESH?
THEY LOOK STALE TO ME.
Baker: YOU MAY TASTE
IF YOU LIKE.
TASTE?
IF I MUST.
AHEM.
I HATE THEM.
OH, I'M SORRY.
TO EACH HIS OWN.
THERE'S ANOTHER BAKERY SHOP
DOWN THE BLOCK
WHOSE WARES MIGHT BE
MORE TO YOUR LIKING.
THANK YOU FOR COMING IN.
MAY I HELP YOU, SIR?
YES. WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME
A MOMENT?
I'M SORRY. I COULDN'T HELP
BUT OVERHEAR. EXCUSE ME, SIR.
BUT MAY I SAY
THAT YOUR RUDENESS
TO THIS HARDWORKING
GENTLEMAN IS UNCALLED FOR.
PLEASE, SIR.
I BEG YOUR PARDON.
NO, I BEG YOURS, SIR.
I HAPPEN TO KNOW
THAT THIS GENTLEMAN IS ONE
OF THE FINEST PASTRY CHEFS
ON THE EASTERN SEABOARD.
- WELL, THANK YOU.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.
- OF COURSE YOU DO.
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?
MY POINT IS THAT YOU WOULD NOT
KNOW A GOOD CREAM PUFF
IF IT JUMPED UP
AND LICKED YOU ON THE ASS.
IT'S JUST A DIFFERENCE
IN TASTE.
NO. THIS MAN IS CLEARLY
AN IMBECILE.
AH, AN INSULT!
I'M INSULTED?
YES!
I'M INSULTED!
OH, FINE, WELL,
GOOD, GOOD, GOOD!
WELL, I AM!
BUT I'M SURE YOU'RE NOT
AS INSULTED AS THIS GENTLEMAN.
- I'M NOT INSULTED.
- OH, YES, YOU ARE!
THE MAN WORKS ALL DAY
LIKE A MULE
TO SUPPORT
HIS MISERABLE FAMILY.
MY FAMILY ISN'T MISERABLE.
WE'RE ALL QUITE HAPPY.
NO, YOU'RE NOT!
YOU'RE MISERABLE
AND PATHETIC. LOOK AT YOU.
Baker: WELL, I...
ALL DAY WORKING LIKE A LACKEY
FROM RISE TO SET,
SWEATING IN THE EYE
OF PHOEBUS.
I LOVE MY WORK.
NO, YOU DON'T!
MY GOD, HOW COULD YOU?
ARE YOU
NO, YOU ARE!INSULTING HIM?
THAT'S
WHAT I THOUGHT!
OH, HOW IT GRIEVES ME
TO SEE A MAN LIVING
THE LIFE OF A DOG.
AND TREATED WORSE THAN A DOG
BY A BOURGEOIS PIG!
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
THIS GENTLEMAN.
OH, I KNOW HIM!
I KNEW THEM ALL!
PUPPETEERS. AND YOU, THE POOR
SWEATY BLUE-COLLARED BUMPKIN
AT THE END
OF THEIR STRINGS.
WHAT A FOOL YOU ARE!
I AM NOT A FOOL!
YES, YOU ARE!
YOU REALLY
SHOULDN'T TALK
TO THAT GENTLEMAN
THIS WAY.
YOU LIKE
THE CREAM PUFFS.
I DON'T LIKE
THE CREAM PUFFS.
FUCK THE CREAM PUFFS!
THIS MAN IS A SLAVE
AND AN IDIOT!
GET OUT OF HERE!
WHAT?
GET OUT OF MY SHOP!
I'LL HANDLE THIS.
YOU'VE REALLY SAID
QUITE ENOUGH.
I THINK WE'VE HEARD
QUITE ENOUGH FROM YOU.
BEGONE!
SIR, HOW CAN I
REPAY YOU?
PLEASE.
I DID NOTHING.
I INSIST.
YOU CAME TO MY AID.
WELL...
PERHAPS A CREAM PUFF.
NO, NO. YOU DON'T
LIKE THEM.
WELL...
I HAVE SOMETHING
EVEN BETTER.

ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH.
YUP.
THAT MAN IS UNWATCHABLE.
YUP.
YOU COULDN'T PAY ME TO GO

SEEMS, MADAM?
NAY, IT IS.
I KNOW NOT "SEEMS."
'TIS NOT ALONE MY INKY CLOAK,
GOOD MOTHER,
NOR THE CUSTOMARY SUITS
OF SOLEMN BLACK,
NOR THE DEJECTED 'HAVIOR
OF THE VISAGE,
TOGETHER WITH ALL FORMS,
MOODS, SHAPES OF GRIEF,
THAT CAN DENOTE ME TRULY.
THESE INDEED SEEM,
FOR THEY ARE ACTIONS

AAH!
WHAT THE HELL'S HE DOING?
DRUNKEN SON OF A BITCH.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN...
IT APPEARS AN ACTOR,
HAVING MISSED A PARRY,
UPSET BY HIS MISTAKE,
HAS VACATED THE STAGE.
THEREFORE,
WITH YOUR KIND PERMISSION,
WE WILL LOWER THE CURTAIN--
AND REGROUP, AS IT WERE...

I'D WAIT FOR THE QUIET.
HE'S SAYING WHAT HE WOULD DO
IF HE WAS YOU.
TONIGHT.
I KNOW.
WHAT YOU HAVE JUST SEEN,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
IS UNPROFESSIONAL
BEHAVIOR
OF AN OVERRATED,
UNDER-TALENTED,
DRUNKEN HACK
NAMED JEREMY BURTOM.
HE HAS BLUSTERED HIS WAY
TO SUCCESS
ON THE BACKS OF THE GREAT
SUPPORTING PLAYERS
FOR TOO LONG!
AND IT'S TIME FOR US
TO MAKE A STAND AND SAY NO!
NO, BURTOM! BEGONE!
IT IS TIME FOR US TO SAY,
"NO, BOOZY BOY!"

CONGRATULATIONS

WELL, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH, GOOD FELLA.
OW.
DO YOU FEEL THAT GRIP?
I DO, SIR.

POWERFUL ENOUGH
TO SNAP THE NECK
OF A SMALL BEAST,
AND YET
SENSITIVE ENOUGH
TO CARESS THE TENDER THROAT
OF A YOUNG CASTRATO--
COAX A SONG FROM HIM.
GOOD FOR YOU.
THAT IS WHY I WIN.
I'M SURE IT IS, SIR.
ENJOY YOUR VOYAGE.
OH, I WILL.

MRS. ESSENDINE, IT'S
A PLEASURE TO SEE YOU.
HOW DELIGHTED WE WERE

FOR SOMETHING THAT WE DID
TO THAT MAN BACK THERE
THAT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
HE'S FAMOUS.
HE'S A HACK!
HE'S OVERRATED.
OH, YOU'RE THE ONES
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT!
Both: BUT WE'RE INNOCENT.
I SWEAR WE DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING.
WE COULDN'T
HURT A FLY.
WE NEVER MEANT IT.
HE'S A BIG BABY.
WE WERE AT A BAR.
WE DRANK TOO MUCH--
ADMITTEDLY SO.
ADMITTEDLY SO.
BUT I JUST WAS
EXPRESSING AN OPINION--
IT'S A FREE COUNTRY--

THEY MUST BE FOUND.
WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE WE DO

I'M HALF GREEK.
TOP HALF
OR BOTTOM HALF?
I JEST, I JIBE.
PERHAPS WE SHOULD
WRESTLE SOMETIME.
DO YOU LIKE
THE TAUT ROUNDNESS
THAT EXERCISE BRINGS
TO THE BUTTOCKS?
Maurice: YEAH.
DO YOU ENJOY THE WARMTH
OF THE MEDITERRANEAN SUN
ON THAT SELFSAME PLACE?
I ONCE WRESTLED A MAN
ON THE STEPS
OF THE ACROPOLIS
WHEN THE SUN
WAS AT ITS HEIGHT,
WEARING
ONLY WHAT GOD SENT ME
INTO THE WORLD WITH.
CAN YOU PICTURE THAT?
THAT'S WHERE
WE'LL WRESTLE,
MY SEMI-GRECIAN LAD.
THAT'S WHERE I'LL
MAKE A MAN OF YOU.
OK, WELL, UM...
IT'S BEEN A REAL PLEASURE
MEETING YOU.
WE DO HAVE TO GO NOW.
WE HAVE A LOT TO DO
ON THE SHIP...
AS STEWARDS ON THE SHIP,
AND, UM,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
UM, GOOD LUCK.
SEE YOU AROUND
THE SHIP, LADS.
OH, MY GOD.
BON VOYAGE.
BON VOYAGE.
Happy:
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
OH, SORRY.
WHAT?
MR. FRANKS.
MR. FRANKS, SORRY
I GOTTA RUSH YOU.
WE NEED YOU
FOR REHEARSAL.
I GOT YOUR BAG.
HEY, WAIT, WAIT!
HEY, HEY,
HEY, WAIT!
THIS ONE'S OPEN.
COME ON, QUICK.
COME ON.
OH, GOOD. YOU ARE HERE
TO FIX THE GRAMOPHONE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I WAS GOING TO BE DOING
IF YOU DID NOT COME BY.
I AM NOT IN THE HABIT
OF FIXING THINGS.
I WAS LISTENING
TO THE MUSIC,
AND THEN THERE WAS
NO MORE FUNCTIONING.
ONLY SILENCE.
AND WHEN SHE WAS
SINGING NO MORE,
I GOT SO EXCITED,
I TRIED TO PULL IT,
BUT I SCRATCHED IT,
AND I HURT IT.
YOU DID HURT IT.
Sheik: YES.
YOU SHOULDN'T PULL IT.
NO, I KNOW.
I AM NOW REALIZING THIS.
GOOD. WE WILL FIX
YOUR GRAMOPHONE,
BUT WE HAVE TO GO
AND GET THE TOOLS.
AH.
PASS.
PASS.
THANK YOU.
IT'S A NEW MODEL.
WE DON'T NEED TOOLS.
HMM.
HMM.
Arthur: THERE IT IS.
YOU SEE IT?
Maurice: IT'S BAD.
IT'S VERY PULLED.
WE MAY HAVE TO BE HERE
FOR A WHILE.
I KNOW YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW THESE THINGS WORK,
BUT THEY REALLY SHOULDN'T
BE PULLED LIKE THAT.
NO, THEY SHOULDN'T.
EXCUSE ME.
EXCUSE ME.
MAYBE...
OOH!

DEMISE,
MY DAUGHTER IS OBSESSED
WITH PAIN,
LOSS, AND DEATH.
SHE FINDS THEM ROMANTIC.
WE DON'T FIND DEATH.
IT FINDS US.
IT'S GONNA FIND YOU
IN A MINUTE.
EASY, EASY, MY DEAR,
WITH THAT VALISE.
IT'S HAND-STITCHED
LEATHER.
FLORENTINE.
IT BEARS THE TATTERS
OF A TUSCAN TRYST.
ANOTHER CARCASS.
CAN IT, EM.
WILL THAT BE ALL?
YES. THANK YOU, MY DEAR.
I'D TIP YOU,
BUT I'M CLOTHING RICH
AND CASH POOR
AT THE MOMENT.
SEE ME AT THE END
OF THE VOYAGE.
EMILY.
THOUGH THIS IS, PERHAPS,
OUR LAST VOYAGE OF THIS KIND,
GIVEN THE TREMENDOUS BLOW
TO OUR FINANCES.
YOU MEAN BECAUSE DADDY--
DON'T YOU DARE
TO MENTION HIM!
THAT PHILANTHROPIC COCKSUCKER
LEFT ALL THE MONEY TO THE POOR
AND NOT A DIRTY DIME TO ME.
OH, MARY, MOTHER OF GOD,
WHAT HAVE I EVER DONE TO YOU?
LIFE WITHOUT MONEY
IS NO GODDAMN LIFE AT ALL!
YOU KNOW THAT!
AS I WAS SAYING,
THIS UNFORTUNATE TURN
OF EVENTS NOT WITHSTANDING,
I WANT OUR TRIP TO THE CONTINENT
TO BE A HAPPY AND HOPEFUL ONE,
SO PUT A SMILE
ON THAT LOVELY FACE,
AND LET'S PRAY
THAT THIS SHIP IS OVERFLOWING
WITH MEN OF MEANS.
GOD ALMIGHTY, IT'S THEM!
IT'S YOU!
GET THEM, GET THEM!
FASTER!
STOP,
PLEASE, PLEASE!

AND ALL WILL BE EQUAL.
ALL MASKS WILL BE REMOVED, AND
WE WILL ALL HAVE A SINGLE FACE!

QUE J'ADORE *
* VOTRE VOIX
EST SI CARESSANTE *
* QUE LES MURMURES
FREMISSANTS *
* ME BERCENT
DE SA BELLE HISTOIRE *
* ET MALGRE MOI
JE VEUX Y CROIRE *
* PARLEZ-MOI D'AMOUR
* REDITEZ-MOI
DES CHOSES TENDRES *
* VOTRE BEAU DISCOURS
* MON COEUR N'EST PAS LAS
DE L'ENTENDRE *
* POURVU QUE TOUJOURS
* VOUS REPETIEZ
CES MOTS SUPREMES *
* JE VOUS AIME
FELLAS, I JUST HAVE
TO ASK YOU A QUESTION.
AND YOU'VE PROBABLY
THOUGHT OF THIS,
BUT WHEN THE BAKER
GAVE YOU THE TICKETS,
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST SELL THEM
IF YOU NEEDED THE CASH?
I BET THEY WERE WORTH
A LOT OF MONEY.
WELL, I'M GLAD YOU DIDN'T,
OR WE WOULD HAVE NEVER MET.
THANKS, LIL.
THANKS, LIL.
WOULD YOU
LIKE TO DANCE?
YES.
YES?
EXCUSE US.
AH, LOVE.
YES, YES, YES.
AHH.
TO LIFE.
AND ITS MANY DEATHS.
