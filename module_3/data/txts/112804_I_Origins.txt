IAN: Every living person
on this planet has their
own unique pair of eyes.
Each their own universe.
(TYPING)
My name is Dr. Ian Gray.
(BEEPS)
I'm a father, a husband...
...and I'm a scientist.
When I was a child,
I realized that...
...the camera was
designed exactly
like the human eye...
...taking in light
through a lens,
forming it into images.
I began taking
as many pictures of eyes
as I possibly could.
I'd like to tell you
the story of the eyes
that changed my world.
Remember these eyes.
Remember all the details
in these eyes.
Okay.
It started when I was
a 26-year-old Ph.D. student
living in New York.
It was Halloween,
eight years ago.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
(EXHALES)
You okay?
I'm watching the moon.
Can I take a picture
of your eyes?
Why?
It's just
something I do.
(DISTANT SIREN WAILING)
Okay.
Yeah? I've perfected this.

Hi.
Hi.
Do you know the story
of the Phasianidae?
The... No,
what's that?
It's a bird...
...that experiences
all of time
in one instant.
And she sings
the song of love
and anger...
...and fear and joy
and sadness all at once.
All combined into
one magnificent sound.
Where are you from?
Another planet.
What's the bird
sound like?
It sounds like this.
Lean closer.
(SCREAMS)
(CHUCKLES)
It's more like noise.
(CHUCKLING) Yeah.
And this bird...
...when she meets
the love of her life...
...is both happy and sad.
Happy because
she sees that for him
is the beginning...
...and sad
because she knows
it is already over.

AUTOMATED VOICE:
Your identity confirmed.
I finished

factor program.
Last night?
No, this morning.
Because, bitch,
I don't play.
Got the input genes
and then you put
your transcription factor...
Wait a minute.
You stink of vodka.
I mean, like, bad.
Like it smells bad.
Yeah, I know.
I know I reek of vodka.
Stop talking so loud.
(SNIFFS)
Okay, I consolidated
all of your data
into one database.
You are welcome.
You're amazing.
I hate you.
KENNY: Oh, I love you,
that's why I do it.
Oh, hey, you got
a new rotating student.
First year.
IAN: Oh, shi...
KENNY: Yeah.
IAN: Yeah, yeah.
Have fun
babysitting, buddy.
You need gum.
KENNY: You need...
to have fun babysitting.
Karen.
Hi, Ian.
Can I...
Follow me.
KAREN: You're attempting
to make colorblind mice
see color?
IAN: That's the idea.
But after failed
experiment 352,
we'll see.
Why?
Why what?
Do so many
experiments fail?
Why are you interested
in making colorblind mice
see color?
Oh.
Why not?
How are you testing
that they see color?
As the new rotating
lab assistant...
...your job will be
to do very boring,
very repetitive
experiments...
be a glorified
note-taker...
...and not ask me "why"
every five minutes.
Okay? Cool.
Commencing
experiment 353...
...response to
photo pigment protein
in Mus musculus.
The control subjects
B Beta...
...G Gamma,
E Euphoria...
...P...
Psychopannychia.
I don't know
what that means.
Look it up.
G as in
Goodness gracious.
H as in
Help me, please.
Z as in Zoolander.
Are the mice muted with
the photo pigment protein?
When we animate
the lines...
...colorblind mice
stare straight.
Whereas...
...fingers crossed...
...the muted mice sh...
Track the lines
with their eyes.
Holy shit.
Holy fucking shit.
Is this on the background
of PAX6 overexpression?
You're a first year?
I know, it's surprising
I can put together
a sentence.
Sorry, I asked my last
three lab assistants
not to come in...
...and I'd sign
their credits.
Anyway, this is just
one step in a very,
very long process.
This is a rough
estimation...
...but let's just say
that the human eye has
12 working parts, right?
Simplest eye
having one.
So, if we can
fill in the gaps,
the evolutionary gaps...
...using single mutations...
we can map out the most
logical progression...
...of the most
basic eye...
...to the most complex,
fully formed human eye.
KAREN:
I don't understand,
why take the time?
We know that it evolved.
It's an assumption,
it's not a fact.
When you're
no longer a first year,
you'll see how
important facts are.
Right.
Each of these animals
has an eye
that's best selected
for its environment.
It would be cleaner...
...less variables,
if you had an origin.
Go on.
You start with one...
...to get to 12.
But what if you had zero?
A non-seeing organism
and built genetically
an eye from scratch...
...a zero to 12.
It'd be a perfect proof,
unassailable.
Non-seeing organisms
don't have the PAX6 gene.
How do you know?
Has anyone ever
checked all of them?
I don't think anyone
has ever checked...
all of them.
You've thought
of this before?
Why did you
look surprised?
Because so have you.
Okay.
Who were those girls?
(KENNY SIGHS)
Which girls?
The ones at
the Halloween party
in the S&M outfits.
S&M outfits?
I met one of them.
Don't know her name.
I don't know her face,
but she had these
most amazing eyes.
So specific.
Central heterochromia.
Oh, reminds me.
Guess what I did?
What?
I figured out an improved
implementation technique...
...for Daugman's
biometrics algo.
IAN: You ever feel like
when you met someone,
they fill this hole
inside of you...
...and that when
they're gone
you feel that space
painfully vacant?
Are you okay, man?
(CHUCKLING) Yeah, yeah.
I'm okay, are you okay?
What did you just say?
Did you say...
(STAMMERING)
The way you talked was,
like, poetic.
It was weird.
(CHUCKLING)
Shut the fuck up.
It was so weird, dude.
I can't believe...
(CLATTERING)
Oh, shit.
This guy
is painfully vacant.
Ian, look at him.
He's so painfully vac...
He's so painfully vacant.
(CHUCKLES)
Fuck off.
Can I get a pack

(CASH REGISTER DINGS)

IAN: Karen.
Mmm-hmm?
What are you doing?
Five percent
of all animals
don't have vision...
...and there are 8.7
million species...
So I blasted PAX6
at the database,
but nothing came up.
So I started
sequencing by myself.
How many
did you sequence?
Twelve.
You've done 12.
So, how many
do you have left?
Like, approximately
426,000.
Are you going to
write 426,000 names
on the window?
I'm going to find it
before I get to
the end of the window.
Okay.
KAREN: What are you doing?
I'm not doing anything.
(DOOR OPENS)

Don't you lock

Nothing has been done before
IAN: So, are you gonna
tell me where you're from?
So many places,
I don't know.
Which places?
Mmm...
To make it short,
I was born in Argentina...
...and when I was 11,
I moved to France
with my grandmother.
And your parents?
Next.
(CUP CLATTERS)
So, what do you do?
Next.
Why did you sleep
with me that night?
Poor judgment.
I was lonely for
a long time and...
...when I saw you
that night I...
...I had the feeling
that I had known you.
Actually, I felt
like you knew me.
IAN: What do you mean?
Like we are connected
from past lives.
I don't believe in that.
What do you believe in?
I'm a scientist.
I believe in data.
A scientist?
Mmm-hmm.
What kind of scientist?
Molecular biology.
I'm most fascinated
with the eye.
The eye, the eyes?
The eyes.
Why the eye?
The eye is the one
sticking point that
religious people use
to discredit evolution.
They use it as proof of
an intelligent designer.
SOFI: Intelligent designer?
IAN: God.
I'm looking to end
the debate once
and for all with...
...clear, clean facts.
Data points
of every stage
of eye-evolution.
Why are you working
so hard to disprove God?
Disprove? Who proved
that God was there
in the first place?
Anyway, let's get
some real data points
on you, okay?
Be my guest.
I prefer talking
about myself anyway.
(CHUCKLES)
Okay.
Um...
What's your favorite...
SOFI: Candy?
Strawberry Mentos.
IAN: Food?
SOFI: Veggie burritos.
I'm vegetarian,
you should know that.
IAN: What's your
favorite flower?
SOFI: Dandelions.
IAN: Okay. Why?
SOFI: 'Cause they're free,
wild, and you can't buy them.
IAN: What's your favorite
field of study?
SOFI: The stars.
IAN: What's your
favorite animal?
SOFI: The white peacock.
You ever see one?
IAN: Mmm.
SOFI: There's one in New York.
I'll take you to see it.
(WATER TRICKLING)
IAN: So, you're gonna
see me again?
SOFI: Maybe.
You know,
in Indian mythology...
...the white peacock
symbolizes souls
being dispersed
throughout the world.
IAN: Did you ever think
it just symbolizes
a lack of melanin
or pigment in the cells?
IAN: The control subjects T...
KAREN: T as in Tsunami.
IAN: G as in...
KAREN: Gnome.
P as in...
Pneumonia.
M as in...

(LAUGHING)
(LIGHTER CLICKS)
I start to see these
elevens, like, everywhere.
Too many elevens.
The amount
was so staggering,
so unlikely,
that I followed them.
And when I followed them,
I found your eyes,
which then led me to you.
Because I found you
through your eyes.
So unlikely,
like life itself.
I know.
I sent them to you.
Bullshit.
You know
you have it.
Have what?
But you're scared of it.
I have what?
Okay.
You live in
this room, right?
Mmm-hmm.
Reality.
You have a bed,
you have books, um...
...a desk,
a chair, lamps.
Logic.
But in this room,
you have a door...
...to the other side.
See?
Light comes through.
It's open.
Just a tiny bit,
but it is open.
You keep trying
to close that door
because you're scared.
But you won't
always be scared.
What's behind the door?
Besides my dirty laundry.
You have to go in
to find out.
You know what
I'm talking about.
I have no idea.
You will.
You will.
Mmm!
(GASPS)
You want to move
to my place?
You have a place?
Mmm-hmm.
Of course.
Can I move in tomorrow?
(CHUCKLES)
(OPERA MUSIC PLAYING)
(DOORBELL BUZZES)
(GRUNTING)
(IAN CLEARS THROAT)
Is this your family?
SOFI: Yes,
it's my grandmother.
Such an eccentric beauty.
And...
My parents and me
when I was baby.
Um, the white peacock,
but you have
met him before. Mmm.
This is a proof
of the spirit world.
El Angel de la Resurrección.
What?
It's the name
of the statue.
Of the statue in
Saint Anne's Cemetery.
It's in Saint
Anne's Cemetery?
Mmm-hmm.
But look at the eyes.
They're alive.
IAN: It's amazing
what you can do on
Photoshop these days.
SOFI: There's no Photoshop!
The eyes appeared
just when she took
the picture.
Just...
You're so beautiful.
Let's get more boxes.
(DOOR OPENS)
Nineteen days

She is ready.
Fame,
science grants...
...fortune await you.
If you find
that PAX6 gene,
we'll be well on our way
to all of that.
Recognition makes me
extremely nauseous.
Well, it is important
that people know
about the work.
To me, the best thing
about living like
a lab rat...
...is that sometimes...
...really rare times...
...you actually
discover something.
On the night of a discovery
when you're lying in bed...
...you are the only person
in the world
that knows it's true.
Can you promise
me something?
Promise you something?
Mmm-hmm.
What?
Promise.
I can't promise
if you don't tell me...
Promise first.
Before you tell me
what it is?
Mmm-hmm.
I keep my promises.
(SNIFFS)
Whatever, I won't tell.
Promise.
Okay, I promise.
I want you to burn me.
Burn you?
I don't want to rot
in a box when I die.
Oh, you mean
like cremate you.
Mmm...
Yeah.
Oh, no. I don't want
to be cremated.
Mmm.
This is a big disagreement
I didn't know we had.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Cremation is
like obliteration.
I mean, what if
in the future,
the scientists...
What if they can
reconstitute ourselves
through our DNA?
I want to be
clear with you.
Mmm.
I don't want that.
You don't want what?
I don't want to be cloning.
(STAMMERING) Cloneed.
"I don't want
to be cloning."
(LAUGHS)
Cloneed!
No, but I'd reconstitute
myself first...
...then I'd reconstitute you
and then I'd ask you,
"Do you wanna be alive?"
And then if you didn't,
I'd kill you. (CHUCKLING)
(BOTH LAUGH)
No, but then we could
be together forever,
like, for real,
scientifically.
Reanimated,
reconstituted.
(SNIFFS)
You have a hard
time letting go.
Don't worry.
We'll find
each other again.
(SNIFFS)
I love your smell.
What is it?
I won't tell.
Come on, tell me.
Mmm-mmm.
(SNIFFING)
Will you marry me?
CLERK: Next?
Can I help you?
BOTH: We'd like
to get married.
Do you have your ID's?
Yeah.
Yes.
(CLEARS THROAT)
First you have to get
your marriage license,
so you have
to fill these out.
Okay.
You're gonna have
to wait 24 hours
before you can
actually get married.
Twenty-four hours?
Yeah.
Why?
Well, this way,
you have 24 hours
to decide
whether you want to
marry this young man.
But I want to marry him!
In 24 hours.
So, okay. All right.
Yeah, so we can't
get married today.
(SIGHS)
Okay. (CHUCKLES)
(LAUGHS)
This system really
kills the spontaneity
factor, hmm?
We're already married
in the spirit world.
(CELL PHONE BUZZING)
Shit.
Hello?
KAREN: Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi. What's up?
You called like five times.
I did.
Why would I do that?
Why might
I call five times?
I don't know.
I was running
the electrophoretic drill,
you know,
just another Tuesday.
And I started sequencing
the genes of
this strange worm...
...called Eisenia fetida.
IAN: Go on.
KAREN: And, uh...
I found the PAX6
master switch.
No.
Yeah.
Are you serious right now?
Are you fucking with me?
Do you know
what this means?
We found an origin species
and we can build an eye
from scratch. (CHUCKLES)
Holy sh...
(SIGHS)
Um, does it have
the same amino acid
sequence as humans?
I can't even
talk right now.
I feel like I'm gonna
piss myself.
Can you just come in here?
Okay, I'm coming in right now.
You're amazing.
Bye. Bye, bye, bye.
Who was that?
That was Karen, um,
my rotating...
Well, my lab partner.
I have to go into
the lab right now.
Do you want
to come with me?
On our wedding day?
Well, technically,
it's not our
wedding day today.
And we've been
married forever
in the spiritual
world, right?
Sofi, please come in with me.
It's really important.
Sure.
Yeah?
Mmm. It's fine.
Let's go.
IAN: Well, don't be
upset about it.
Let's put our rings on.
I don't want to,
it's bad luck.
I don't believe in luck.
I do believe
we've known each other
since forever, though.
Really?
Yeah. You know how?
When the
Big Bang happened...
...all the atoms
in the universe
were all smashed together...
...into one little dot
that exploded outward.
So my atoms and
your atoms were
certainly together then...
...and, who knows,
probably smashed together
several times...
...in the last
13.7 billion years.
So my atoms have
known your atoms...
...and they've always
known your atoms.
My atoms have always
loved your atoms.
Let's go!
(CHUCKLES)
(DOOR OPENS)
IAN: Karen.
(EXHALING) Hi.
Hey.

This is Sofi.
This is Karen.
Karen, this is Sofi.
Hi.
She's my wife.
(CHUCKLES)
Welcome, um...
What do you wanna see?
IAN: I wanna see everything.
KAREN: Uh, so,
I have this gel.
IAN: And it aligns?
KAREN: The alignment
crossed PAX6 proteins,
98 percent identity.
IAN: Are these the worms?
They can't see anything.
IAN: Not for long.
(KAREN CHUCKLES)
(KAREN SIGHS)
(IAN MUMBLING)
You know, um, I should...
I'm gonna go take a shower.
(CHUCKLES)
You've seen it.
IAN: Shower?
I should shower,
brush my teeth...
Wait, you're gonna
go right now?
KAREN: Um, yeah.
I'm sure you want
to show your wife
around the lab and...
Okay. Are you sure?
Okay, well, uh,
this is amazing.
The beginning of
something amazing.
It was nice
to meet you.
IAN: Amazing stuff, Karen.
Bye.
IAN: Bye.
(DOOR OPENS)
(DOOR CLOSES)
What's wrong?
I know something's
wrong, so...
You leave me everyday
to torture little worms?
We're not
torturing worms, Sofi.
If you're interested,
we're modifying organisms.
In this case,
they happen to be worms
that are blind...
...and we're
modifying them
to have vision.
You can make
blind worms see?
Kind of.
I mean,
we can now, maybe.
You think
that's a good idea?
Do you think
it's a bad idea?
I think it's dangerous
to play God.
Sofi, I believe in proof.
There is no proof
that there is some
magical spirit...
...uh, that's invisible,
living above us,
right on top of us.
How many senses
do worms have?
They have two.
Smell and touch.
Why?
So...
...they live without
any ability to see
or even know
about light, right?
The notion of light
to them is unimaginable.
Yeah.
But we humans...
...we know
that light exists.
All around them...
...right on top of them...
...they can't sense it.
But with a little mutation,
they do. Right?
Correct.
So...
...Doctor Eye...
...perhaps some humans,
rare humans...
...have mutated to
have another sense.
A spirit sense.
And can perceive
a world that is right
on top of us...
...everywhere.
Just like the light
on these worms.
So, you're a mutant.
Mmm-hmm.
And I'm not the only one.
(GLASS SHATTERS)
Ow! Oh...
Jesus!
Are you okay?
I got formaldehyde
in my eye.
Here, let me see.
Get the splash kit.
(GROANING)
What is it?
Fuck!
What is it? Tell me!
(STAMMERING) It's yellow,
it's right over there!
It's yellow! Call Karen!
Fucking call Karen, now!
Where's the number?
The number's by the door.
SOFI: By the door.
Got it.
(SIGHS) We should do
this every Friday.
How many fingers
am I holding up?
Twelve.
He's not blind,
so that's good.
(SNIFFS)
I think

REPORTER ON TV:
He claims to have put
to rest the notion...
...that the eye was made
by an intelligent designer.
Dr. Gray, you made
some mutants
in a laboratory...
...and now you expect
all religious people
to just throw away
their beliefs?
Well, I expect them
to fight me every step
of the way.
But I do implore
them to look at the
evidence and data
we've collected here.
These specimens are
practical examples
of every stage
of eye development.
Dr. Ian Gray, uh,
thanks for being here.
IAN: Thanks for having me.
The book is

IAN: What?
What if we turn
the garage into a lab?
And the baby could be
our first test subject.
That's a great idea.
KAREN: Is there something
ethically wrong with that?
No.
You know what
I wanna do?
I think we should leave.

(STAMMERING)
I never do this.
(SIGHS)
I sometimes think
about the cause
and effect of it...
And I think about how,
and I don't feel guilty
for this...
...but I think about how
if I hadn't called you
into the lab that day...
...she would maybe
still be here and
you would be with her.
Can I tell you something
that makes me feel
like a monster?
That day in the elevator...
...I thought to myself...
"Am I going to be stuck
with this child
the rest of my life?"
And then the next moment
she was dead.
We were never gonna

I just never got closure.
I never got

Iris scanning is a new
identification measure...
...taken up by the more
sophisticated hospitals.
We know what
iris scanning is.
We've had it in our lab
for a decade.
Well, it's still new
to the general public.
Now, we are not yet legally
required to scan eyes...
...but we adopted
the technology
and use it with
the parents' consent.
I'm fine with it.
You, uh...
Scan. Yeah,
do the scan.
I dim the lights.
(WOMAN TALKING INDISTINCTLY)
NURSE: The system
is non-obtrusive...
...and, in all actuality,
is just taking photo
of the eyes.
(COOING)
There you go.
IAN: Come here, Tobias.
NURSE: Oh, thank you.
IAN: You got it?
(COOING)
Yes, I got it.
Thank you.
What happens then is...
...the computer finds
a bunch of points in
the crevices of the eye...
Yeah, we understand
how it works.
(NURSE GASPS)
Forgive me.
These systems
are sort of new.
Can you tell?

(TELEPHONE RINGING)
(BEEPS)
Hello?
DR. SIMMONS:
Hi, is this Ian Gray?
(TOBIAS COOING)
It is.
My name is Dr. Simmons.
I work in conjunction
with Yale
and the Greenwich Hospital...
...where you and your wife
gave birth in July.
(STUTTERS) Yeah?
Is everything okay?
Yes. Everything's okay,
please don't be alarmed.
We would however
like to run a few
simple tests on Tobias.
His test results
may suggest,
although highly unlikely...
...the possibility
of early autism.
You know I'm a doctor.
What test results?
The...
We've pinpointed, uh...
Uh...
Uh, can you hold
on a moment, please?
Karen, listen to this.
(KISSES)
(BEEPS)
Yeah.
We've pinpointed
an array of molecular
compounds that
appear in the urine...
...of children
with autism.
(INHALES SHARPLY)
And Tobias showcased
a few of them.
I promise it's unlikely,
but worth checking out...
...and we have very simple
non-obtrusive tests and we'll
be done in an hour.
IAN: What was your name
and affiliation?
Dr. Janet Simmons.
I run a research lab
on child autism...
...in conjunction with Yale
and the Greenwich Hospital.
IAN: Simmons, you said?
Janet Simmons.
Our clinic is in Stamford,
not too far from there.
It's important to
check this soon.
There's no alarming rush,
but we could
see him today.
Okay, thank you.
You'll hear from us.
(BEEPS)
Baby, I love you.
Tobias. Look here,
look here.
(TOBIAS COOING)
I'm not sure
I understand
how this is testing
for autism.
The blood and urine
test will check
for molecular
compounds.
This test is
purely perceptual.
Tracking the child's
eye movements
and attractions.
(COOING)

This Dr. Simmons
is up to something.
Child autism my ass.
I keep running
through her studies.
What was she doing?
Two images side by side.
IAN: Two images,
similar but different.
Tobias would look
at one or the other.
Do you remember
anything specific
about the images?
Something connected
to something?
Something we could look up?
There was
a farmhouse.
There was, um...
Dan's Diner
in Boise, Idaho.
Whatever that means.
(TYPING)
KAREN: Why,
that's a real place.
(AIRPLANE ENGINE ROARING)

(DISHES CLATTERING)
I'm not from around here.
I was wondering...
...is there anything
interesting in town to see?
WOMAN: Not much
around these parts.
'Less you, uh, fancy
visiting some cows
down at the Dairy farm.
There's a dairy farm.
WOMAN: Mmm-hmm.
WOMAN: That'll be
a dollar.
Oh.
Of course.
Where is the dairy farm
located?
Uh, take a left,
about two miles
down the road.
Can't miss it.
(COW MOOING)
We'll have them

Oh. Okay.
Come on.
(COWS MOOING)
Is this the dairy farm?
WOMAN: Indeed, it is.
These are milking cows?
WOMAN: These are meat cows,
not milking cows.
I'm Julie Dairy.
This is my family's farm.
Julie Dairy.
Uh, Paul Edgar Dairy.
Are you related to him?
Yes, he's my father.
Is he here?
You're clearly not with
the biography association.
(STAMMERS) I'm sorry,
I don't follow.
Some documentary crew
came through here
a few months ago...
...wanting to do
a story on the great
Paul Edgar Dairy...
...the only
black farmer in Boise.
(DOG BARKING)
They took some pictures.
I liked the story
and they said
they'd follow up.
You okay?
How you doing there?
I'm okay.
I'm just, uh, having
a moment of déjà vu.
Can we fetch you
some water,
or a cup of tea?
I'd really love to meet
Paul if that was possible.
KAREN: What if we just
start at the beginning
and break it down?
(PILLS RATTLE)
In the hospital,
Tobias' eyes come up
as a match with
Paul Edgar Dairy...
...which is not correct
because Tobias
has blue eyes...
...and Paul Edgar Dairy
has brown eyes.
Uh, no, iris biometrics
is not based on color.
It's based on
the unique crypts,
furrows and shapes
in the texture.
So, maybe Tobias and Paul
have the same iris pattern.
(IAN CLEARS THROAT)
Statistically impossible.
KAREN: Second data point...
...Tobias and Paul
have some kind
of connection.
It's not our test,
so we don't know.
And the third
data point is that...
...Paul Edgar Dairy dies
before Tobias is born.
Was conceived.
Was conceived.
Because Tobias
was born in July...
...and Paul Edgar Dairy
dies in September 2012.
That's ten months.
(STAMMERS)
What are you guys
talking about right now?
You guys sound
like crazy people.
Okay? What is this
connection referencing?
Doctor...
KAREN: Jan... Dr. Simmons.
IAN: From Yale.
She did this test
on Tobias.
KENNY: Dr. Simmons?
From Yale?
She's one of five people
who have access
to the eye database.
KENNY: My company
owns a patent
on iris biometrics...
...and consolidate
all their data
into one database...
...and Simmons is
one of five people
that have access.
But you have
access to it, too.
Sort of.
I can find
the iris code...
...run it and see
if it's in the system
and then check
the IP address...
...and check when and where
it was registered.
I can do that.
IAN: How do you do that?
Look into that.
(DEVICE BEEPS)
Okay. Other eye.
(BEEPS)
KENNY: All right.
Okay.
So, I can't get your
name or biographicals...
...but I can see that
you are in the system.
Amazing.
Right.
Hmm.
(TYPING)
And that you were
registered
at the lab in 2005...
...and the same
should be for
Karen and myself.
What are you thinking,
Karen?
Well, check this out.
So, Paul and Tobias
have the same
iris patterns,
let's just say.
Mmm.
And there's some
sort of connection.
So the next logical step
in our scientific
inquiry is...
...to find someone
that we do know
who's a duplicate
in the system.
Like a family
member who has died.
IAN: That's it.
We need another match.
(KENNY SCOFFS)
KENNY: Guys, this is
statistically impossible.
You're not gonna
find anything.
Can you get
a scan from a photo?
It has to be high-res
and in focus.
Technically,
I can do it.
I have hundreds of high-res
photos of people's eyes.
(TYPING)
KENNY: All right.
You can scan these.
KENNY: Give me
the hard drive.
This is ridiculous.
Who do you want me to run?
Mmm. Run my father,
Tobias George Gray.
He died two years ago.
(TYPING)
He's in the system...
...and he's registered
at Heathrow, 2006.
That makes sense.
He was traveling
there frequently.
Try, um, my uncle, Basil.
(CLICKS)
IAN: Died seven years ago
of cancer.
KENNY: All right.
Not found.
Try your grandparents.
My grandparents.
Bev and Barry.
KENNY: Bev.
She's in the system.
Registered...
...at Schiphol airport
in Amsterdam, 1998.
How many people
are in the database?
There's like
hundreds of millions.
There's a billion soon.
IAN: Try my grandparents.
KENNY: Right there.
KENNY: Judy is in the system.
She's registered
at a nursing home
in New Haven in 2009.
And Malcolm?
KENNY: Malcolm.
(KAREN SIGHS)
IAN: Not found.
All right,
so anybody else?
Sofi.
Okay, try Sofi.
KENNY: Okay.
Sofi.
(CLICKS)
She's in the system.
That makes sense.
She was probably
scanned when she
came through customs.
KENNY: No.
It says that the IP
address coordinates
say that
she was scanned...
...in a community center
in Delhi, India.
She must have
traveled there.
Three months ago?
IAN: That doesn't
make any sense.
KENNY: That's not right.
It's an error.
It's only the seventh one
we've tried.
I need to get
some air.
KENNY: What the fuck
is happening?
(SWITCH CLICKS)
Did you put him to bed?
Yeah.
(SHOE THUDS)
You should go to India.
Can't go to India.
Can't or won't?
IAN: India is not Boise,
Idaho, Karen.
There is someone there
with Sofi's exact
iris pattern.
The eyes and the brain
are connected.
If the cellular
structure in the eye
is reoccurring from
person to person...
...then maybe
something in the brain...
...carries over as well,
like a neurological link.
Maybe the eye really
is some kind of...
...window to the soul.
Soul, Karen? Soul?
Is my wife really
using the word "soul"?
Like you hold any
validity in that?
Call it whatever
you wanna call it.
Dr. Simmons was testing
a memory connection...
...between our son
and Paul Edgar Dairy.
And it wasn't our test,
but you can go to India...
...and you can find
this person with
Sofi's eyes and you can
do the same.
IAN: I can't go there.
It's just India...
Not India!
I can't go there!
I can't go back there!
I can't go back
to that part
of my life!
I can't do it!
I gotta just let it go.
The man I married...
...I don't think
he would let
his own grief,
even if it was
overwhelming...
...get in the way
of what could
potentially be...
...the greatest
scientific discovery
the world has ever seen.
This is bigger than you.
It's bigger than me.
It's bigger than Sofi.
Then maybe
you should go.
I would, but I...
I didn't know Sofi.
It's a false positive,
you understand?
It's an error.
It has to be an error.
It's statistically
impossible. Data point.
If I drop this phone
a thousand times,
a million times...
...and one time,
it doesn't fall...
...just once,
it hovers in the air.

That is an error
that's worth looking at.
You're so
fucking stubborn.

Am I religious?
I thought you

I'm not religious.
Why not?
Religion is based
on scripture
written by men
thousands of years ago.
Those beliefs can't be
changed or challenged.
They're fixed.
In science, great thinkers
have written things
very long ago...
...but every generation
improves upon them.
The words are not holy.
Einstein is a brilliant man,
but he is not our god.
He's one step
in the evolution
of knowledge...
...but we always
continue to step forward.
You know, a scientist
once asked the Dalai Lama...
"What would you do
if something scientific...
"disproved your
religious beliefs?"
And he said
after much thought...
"I would look
at all the papers
"and take a look at
all the research...
"and really try to
understand things.
"And in the end,
if it was clear
"that the scientific
evidence...
"disproved my
spiritual beliefs...
"I would change
my beliefs."
That's a good answer.
Ian.
What would you do if
something spiritual...
...disproved your
scientific beliefs?

IAN ON PHONE:
Hello, love.
The bank called today.
They said $2,000
a day is going
to some sketchy
Planet India company.
It's like 20 K already.
What's going on?
I put up a billboard.
It know it sounds a bit
extreme, but it's all
I could think of.
Ian, it's been weeks.
I think you should
come back.
Karen, what happened
to turning over
rocks and finding
nothing is progress?
I'm down with
the big picture
of all this.
I'm the one who
wanted you to go.
But failed experiments
are not unknown
to us, right?
We regroup, we look
for more matches,
we try again.
(CHILDREN CLAMORING)
Please come home.
Do you speak English?
A little.
A little?
Yes.
What's your name?
Salomina.
IAN: Salomina?
Yes.
Salomina,
(STUTTERS) I'm Ian.
My name's Ian.
Are you hungry?
Yes.
You are?
Yes.
Come on, let's get
you some food.
Come on.
Priya, I found her.
I'm going to the hotel.
Hey! Meet me there.
Listen, I'll be
right there, okay?
(CARS HONKING)
What's your
favorite food?
SALOMINA: Strawberry.
Strawberry?
Just strawberry?
What's your
favorite color?
Pink, purple,
blue and green.
Pink, purple,
blue and green?
Blue and green.
That's so many.
See my finger?
Can you follow it?
Very good.
Very good.
Very good. Very good.

Yeah.
(CLICKS)
(COMPUTER CHIMES)
I wanna show you
something that will
take your breath away.
Karen, this is Salomina.
Salomina, this is Karen.
I need my lab partner.
Okay. Yeah.
KAREN: I'm ready.
Okay, so, Salomina...
...it's a very easy game.
I'm gonna show
you three things
and you pick the one
that's your favorite.
Okay.
You understand?
Yes.
Okay.
Commencing experiment one.
Memory connection
between subjects
with identical
iris patterns.
KAREN: Got it.
IAN: Subject, Salomina.

(INHALES SHARPLY)
What's the tally?
44 percent.
Which is, um,
a touch above random...
...by an unfortunately
standard margin.
How do you feel?
IAN: I think
numbers don't lie.
I didn't ask what you think,
I asked what you feel.
I feel...
...kind of foolish.
I'll see you soon.
Okay.
(LAPTOP CHIMES)
I make bad test?
What?
I made bad test?
No. No, you did fine.
You did perfect.
It's just a stupid test.

Red wine
And sleeping pills
Help me get back
to your arms
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Cheap sex
And sad films
Help me get back
where I belong
I think you're crazy
Maybe
I think you're crazy
Maybe
Stop sending letters
Letters always get burned
It's not like the movies
They fed us
on little white lies
I think you're crazy
Maybe
I think you're crazy
Maybe
I will see you
In the next life...
Give me an update
on the archivist images.
We've collected
hundreds of images
at high enough resolution.

on your approval to scan.
