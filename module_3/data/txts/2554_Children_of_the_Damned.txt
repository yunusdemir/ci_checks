Five, four, three, two, one...
...go!
When he did this before,
it had a bad effect on the children.
I hope there'll be no need
for another session.
Derrick!
I think that'll be all.
Thank you very much indeed.
All right, boys. You are dismissed.
Well?
I'm impressed.
His total time for the eight tests
was six minutes, three seconds.
You took two hours, eight minutes,
and you beat me.
I said I was impressed.
What about his parents?
Are they exceptional?
I don't know.
He lives with his mother.
But she's never bothered
to come to parents' nights.
I think we ought to see her.
Breeding tells, you know.
Well.
Good afternoon.
My name's Lewellin.
I'm a psychologist
at London University.
I wondered if we could have a word
with you about your son, Paul.
- Who's he?
- This is Dr. David Neville.
Despite appearances, senior lecturer
in genetics at the university.
- All right.
- Thank you.
Haven't had a chance
to straighten up yet.
I've been conducting
an intelligence test, Mrs. Looran.
I've been testing children
from all over England on a project...
...for the United Nations.
You see, this is the first time that
an identical IQ test has been given...
...to schoolchildren
from all over the world.
Naturally, some unexpected things
have turned up.
And that's why we've come
to see you about Paul.
His intellect is almost beyond belief.
Is it?
It made us wonder
about his background.
About you, Mrs. Looran.
- And about his father, of course.
- Oh, did it?
We thought it might be interesting
if you took the test too.
I won't take any test. If that's
what you want, you can forget it.
There's really nothing to it,
Mrs. Looran.
- It would help us immensely.
- I just don't want to do it.
Now, you can forget it.
You better go now.
I've got things to do.
- About Paul's father, is he still...?
- That's none of your business!
Quite right. I was just wondering
what business he was in.
- Get out.
- I'm sure he'd be very proud of the boy.
- lf you could give us his address...
- I don't have to answer.
- Just leave me alone and get out.
- Don't let him upset you.
- Scientists are all alike.
- Get out of here.
Going, Mrs. Looran.
Oh, there is just one thing.
- Is his name Looran?
- Get out!
Fascinating woman.
Well, geneticist,
does she explain anything?
Well, I think we can safely say that
he didn't get his brain from Mother.
They're after you.
And you won't get away.
They're stronger than I am.
I hate you.
I want you to suffer
the way you've made me suffer.
I should have crushed you
to death...
...the first moment
I held you to my breast.
They'll get you now, and I'll help.
I'll do everything I can to help.
He isn't mine.
I gave birth to him...
...but he isn't mine.
I couldn't have a baby.
I hadn't been touched...
...ever.
Oh, don't you understand?
He hasn't got a father.
He isn't human.
- I'd never been touched.
- All right, it's all right.
- The doctor said you have to rest.
- I'd never been touched.
Mrs. Looran, we've heard everything
you have to say...
You don't believe me, you fools.
I warn you, he could butcher you
without even trying.
You fools.
Paul?
- Can I help you?
- Rather.
We were coming to get Paul
for the night...
...but that doesn't seem
to be necessary now.
No, he's safe in bed.
I'm Paul's aunt.
Are you friends of Diana's?
Very close.
Odd that she never mentioned
a sister.
I live with my mother
in Nottingham.
But this afternoon
I got a funny feeling...
...I should come down here today.
- It's lucky you did.
Yes, I wasn't here 20 minutes
when the hospital called.
It would have been awful
if Paul had been here alone.
Yes. Well...
...we'll leave you to it then, Miss...?
- Eliot. Susan Eliot.
- Oh, Thomas.
- Yes?
- What about tomorrow?
- Oh, yes.
A Mr. Harib of the United Nations
is flying from Paris to see Paul.
- Paul?
- Yes.
Your nephew's intelligence
has really rather staggered us all.
I'd like to take him to my office
at the university...
...if that's all right with you.
Well, yes. I'd want to come
with him, of course.
Absolutely.
You must let me show you
my laboratory.
Incidentally, Paul was born
before Diana was married, wasn't he?
Yes.
I'll call for you at about 10 then.
All right, 10.
- Thank you. Good night.
- Good night.
Good night.
They're from the same parents.
The same litter even.
- It's not glandular?
- No, he's perfectly normal in every way.
It's not only that he's bigger,
he's much cleverer.
- He'd get all the food if we let him.
- Will his offspring be the same?
Exactly the same.
He's perfectly normal.
Under free conditions,
his strain would take over.
Do you remember Darwin
and the survival of the fittest?
But this is not an example
of evolution?
Oh, no. This is a sudden,
unexplained mutation in the genes.
And quite honestly, nobody knows
exactly how or why it happened.
So we call them "biological sports."
It occurs throughout nature, you know.
Come and have a look.
Dr. Harib.
For 50 generations, this.
And then suddenly
this extravagance crops up.
Well, there you are.
Plants, animals. There's no known law
why it shouldn't occur in man.
And you think this might explain
the boy?
Well, if I had to give an explanation,
that's the one I'd give.
- How often does this happen?
- Oh, it's entirely unpredictable.
But certainly only once
in several billion chances.
What if I told you, Dr. Neville,
that there were six Pauls in the world?
Same age, same intellect.
Well, I'd say it was genetically
impossible.
We have now the results
of every country in the world.
Five children have scores
identical to that of Paul Looran.
- Identical?
- Yes, identical.
- How's that possible? I mean, no two...
- I have no idea...
...but I would like to find out.
- Well, so would I.
One child from Calcutta is now
a resident here in the Indian Embassy.
Since he and the Looran boy
are both in London...
...I have arranged for the other four
to be brought here by their embassies.
I would like you to retest them all.
In the meantime, gentlemen,
I would like this treated simply...
...a UNESCO research project,
nothing more.
Dr. Neville, Dr. Lewellin...
...I'm very sorry
to have kept you so long.
The ambassador offers
his apologies to Mr. Harib...
...but Nina Sirinova has returned
to Moscow.
- But she was only just flown in.
- And out again.
Moscow has decided
we should not set a precedent...
...of providing a travel service
for UNESCO projects.
Could you tell us anything
about her background?
- Her mother and father?
- No, I'm sorry.
Did you see her mother
when she was here?
- I saw her. Now, please.
- And her father?
The chilïs father did not
accompany her to London.
And I have not been given any details
as to his background.
Now, gentlemen, if you...
Sonya.
This is Sonya, my little daughter.
Look, what's all this about?
As a psychologist, Thomas...
...you really do tend to lose yourself
in the individual, the single mind.
You see, we live
in a complex social world.
Einstein put mass and energy together,
we got the atom bomb.
Now, if you were a Russian politician
and had a child with a brain, say...
...ten times more efficient than
Einstein's, would you gaily let her out...
...to any two British scientists
who crawled out of the wood?
Of course I wouldn't.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Mark, stop it.
Stop it right now, will you?
The boy's absolutely incorrigible.
And that dog, he can get him
to do anything he wants...
...without even saying a word to him.
You are Mark's maternal grandmother,
Mrs. Robbins?
- His mother's mother?
- Yes, Mark's always lived with me.
But Mark bears your family name.
Wasn't your daughter married
when Mark was born?
Must we talk about that?
Well, she was really
a marvelous daughter, she really was.
No mother could have asked for more.
But then, suddenly she
became uncontrollable.
I never knew where she was
or what she was doing.
And for her to turn from me
and become a tramp...
...just an ordinary woman
of the streets practically.
So you want to see
our little genius.
Come this way.
Rashiïs mother.
How very charming.
I was hoping that we would meet.
These gentlemen have come
to meet Rashid.
Is your husband, Rashiïs father,
here too?
Oh, no. He does not work
at the embassy.
Well, it's not very important
anyway.
That's a very pretty sari
you're wearing.
Does Rashid ever make you do things
that you don't want to do?
Hello, Dr. Lewellin. You don't know me.
I'm Colin Webster.
Is David about?
- David.
- Yes, what is it?
- Someone here seems to know us.
- Colin.
What are you doing in London?
It isn't Boat Race week.
- Just prowling around.
- Oh, well, take your coat off.
- Tom, this is the Colin Webster.
- Yes, we've met.
Well, what's up?
Excuse me.
I thought you spent all your time
chasing sexy women...
...in Bucharest and Istanbul.
Or is it Hong Kong and Berlin
nowadays?
Sometimes there's nothing more exciting
than chasing children around London.
You see, Tom? The social world.
So the British lion
is raising its weary head?
Not necessarily.
It's just that we have less reason
than ever to ignore our assets.
May I?
- Have you been following us all day?
- Nothing so exhausting.
You moved about quite a bit,
didn't you?
Dr. Lewellin, what do you make of it?
As a psychologist?
I find it very disturbing.
- And as a geneticist, David?
- A geneticist is always disturbed, Colin.
Look at your development.
It's quite extraordinary.
And the government,
what's their opinion?
You know governments,
always a bit cautious.
I presume you're familiar
with the biological sport.
Only in the most academic way.
- Could they be six sports?
- With identical mutations?
Why, well, I'm always one
for the long chance...
...but that'd be like winning
the Irish Sweepstakes...
...six times running
with exactly the same draw.
David.
I know it sounds ridiculous...
...but has it ever occurred to you
they might have the same father?
It occurred to me.
Well, what an interesting life
you postulate for this father.
But, granted the same father and
mother, what six brothers and sisters...
...of your acquaintance
have exactly the same minds?
And parthenogenesis?
Yes.
"Reproduction without concourse
of the opposite sex,"...
...says the Oxford Dictionary.
"I have never been touched,"
says Mrs. Looran.
Well, Tom, you're a psychologist...
...what about Mrs. Looran's claim
to having given birth to Paul...
...without concourse
of the opposite sex?
She's an obvious hysteric.
Hallucinations, megalomania.
The interesting thing is
that in each and every case...
...there's an unstable mother
and no trace of a father.
Our scientific boys tell me
that parthenogenesis...
...can be induced artificially,
by radioactivity or by certain chemicals.
Oh, certainly. But only
in very simple forms of life.
Algae and one or two other
elementary plants.
But certainly not in man.
- So, what's your explanation?
- I don't think there is one.
At least one that we can understand
at the moment.
But then, we're surrounded by mysteries
beyond our present understanding.
Sherry?
Mrs. Bonn's been at it again.
Oh, well. So long as she keeps away
from my gin.
- And they all did this in 37 seconds.
- Thirty-seven-point-five.
Unreliable source of information,
old boy.
- Not here yet?
- No, sir.
- Hello?
- Dr. Lewellin? Dr. Neville?
You must come immediately.
- This is Dr. Lewellin speaking.
- Dr. Lewellin.
- Hello, who is that, please?
- I need your help.
This is Susan Eliot.
- What's the matter, Miss Eliot?
- I need your help.
- You must come immediately.
- Look, Miss...
This is Susan Eliot. Dr. Lewellin.
Look, just steady down.
What's the matter?
- Would you tell us what's the matter?
- I need your help.
Paul.
Miss Eliot, I'm sorry to disturb you.
I know it's late.
- But may I come in?
- Why? Who are you?
I must talk to you
about your nephew, Paul.
- You go away, or I'll call the police.
- There's no need for that, Miss Eliot.
I've come from Dr. Lewellin
and Dr. Neville.
It is for Paul's own good.
All right.
Thank you.
- You frightened me a bit.
- I know. I'm sorry.
But, you see,
we feel that it might be better...
...if you and Paul were somewhere
a little more conveniently placed.
Could you put some things in a bag?
What, do you mean now?
But it's half past 4 in the morning.
- Just a minute. What do you want?
- I'm afraid that's my business.
- Oh, no, you don't.
- Now, Tom.
Colin Webster's expecting us.
I'm sorry, sir.
He can be settled
and in bed in an hour.
- But I'd like to talk to Dr. Lewellin.
- First thing in the morning.
- Well, well.
- What's going on?
Well, come in, gentlemen, do.
What's the matter, Miss Eliot?
Why did you phone?
He wants to...
- Phone? What do you mean, phone?
- Your call to the flat...
...asking us to come here.
But I didn't phone.
What's happening?
What's this all about?
Miss Eliot,
why don't you get ready?
We can clear the whole thing up
tomorrow.
He wants to take us
to a safer place.
Well, really, Colin.
Save this sort of thing for Istanbul.
We're not the only ones to feel
that you academics...
...have stumbled onto something
that requires our kind of attention.
Three of the embassies you called at
yesterday are flying in special planes...
...to take their own newly-discovered
assets back home.
Now, if they suddenly see the potential
in their own assets...
...they may soon see the advantage
in scotching ours.
But he said he came from you,
that you knew.
- Colin, where's your sense of fair play?
- Look, you don't have to go anywhere.
- Just a minute.
- What?
We'd like Miss Eliot
to accompany Paul, of course.
But her agreement to that
is a mere formality.
This is an authorization,
signed by Paul's mother.
It allows me to take the boy
into my custody.
- Bring my car up.
- Right, sir.
Don't you worry. From now on,
they'll treat you like royalty.
Better than royalty.
What the hell would you do
if all the great powers...
...suddenly smiled at each other,
had a bloody love affair?
Oh, I shouldn't worry too much.
You know how love affairs go.
What the devil is wrong with you?
I don't know.
I must have blacked out.
- Much damage?
- No, I think it's an improvement.
All right, get the boy. I'll drive.
- Where is he, sir?
- Standing over there.
All right, after him. We must find him.
Oh, thank you very much.
Thank you.
- Thank you, Thomas.
- Oh, sorry.
Nobody took him away.
He went off on his own.
- So, what's the worry?
- Someone might take him.
From what I've seen tonight,
that wouldn't be so easy.
Yes, come in.
We've covered the whole area, sir.
No sign of him anywhere.
Why don't you send for the police,
old boy?
Milk and sugar?
- I'll wait here. Get back to headquarters.
- Right, sir.
Susan, how do you like your tea?
Susan?
I'll ask her.
Susan?
She's not here.
Her coat's gone.
- No sign?
- No.
- Well, let's take the car.
- You take the car. I'll go on foot.
Susan!
Susan!
Paul.
Paul, darling.
What have you done?
But, Paul, you can't stay here.
Let me get Dr. Lewellin,
and we'll talk it all out.
Miss Eliot?
But, Paul...
Susan.
Susan!
All right.
But we must speak to Dr. Lewellin
in the morning.
It's nothing.
It's nothing.
How did you know
my hand was cut, Paul?
How did you know?
When Paul was 2,
his birthday cake fell and...
Paul was burned.
Make it a thorough search, now.
She might be stuck anywhere.
Oh, there's a stray dog in there.
You better watch it.
He's behaving as though
he owns the place.
Somebody really ought to do something
about religion in this country.
You take the gallery.
Watch your step.
Who's there?
Harris, no!
Paul!
Paul, stop it!
Don't be a damn fool, Tom.
Paul.
Do you want to stay here, Paul?
All of you?
And you want Susan
to stay here with you?
Is there anything you want, Susan?
We will need food.
All right.
You may leave it outside the church
on the top step.
Move it in now.
Right. Send them in.
Their embassies will know
you're trying to protect them.
Oh, nobody's gonna trust a guard
or a barricade.
No nation can allow brains like that...
...to fall into someone else's hands.
- But, Colin...
...suppose all they want to be
are poets or lovers or even tramps.
You remember Shakespeare
and Casanova.
Yes. Nowadays we'd find a better use
for Shakespeare. Even for Casanova.
They should study and be studied. Set
up an international board of educators...
...to study them.
- An international board?
Well, what's the matter, too civilized?
What would you recommend?
Simple:
Destroy them.
That seems to be it.
The others are busy.
Do you always know
what I'm going to say?
Yes.
Don't you know I couldn't do that?
You're frightened.
- You're frightened.
- Yes.
Mi Ling, nobody wants to harm you.
Those men you saw this morning
were simply looking for you.
Mi Ling, what's it all about?
Why are you all here together? Why?
What's happened?
- I hope this wasn't a mistake.
- We had no choice.
Ask Mr. Harib. If they thought
we were kidnapping their prizes...
...diplomatic hell would break loose.
- There are other kinds of hell.
This part of it is your affair.
I will intercede only if you ask me.
Thank you.
What is it?
We are stronger together.
Paul. Excuse me.
Paul, we want to assure you,
all of you...
...that we do understand
your desire to be together.
Now, these people here
are your friends.
They've come to take you
back home...
...because each country
is very proud of its own...
Of its own prodigy...
...and they want you to learn from,
and to help, your own people.
In the circumstances,
we're prepared to overlook...
...what happened here
early this morning if you come now.
They will not be separated.
- Nina is going to stay.
- Please keep out of it.
If you have hopes of using her mind...
...I warn you,
everything you tell her...
...will instantly be known
to all the others.
Nonsense!
- This is going to get out of hand.
- Yes.
Paul.
Excuse me, please, gentlemen.
Paul, would you come down here
to me, please?
Now, Paul, I don't want you
to answer me, all right?
Calcutta lies at the mouth...
Rashid?
Calcutta lies at the mouth
of River Ganges.
- Mi Ling?
- "Dr. David Neville...
...special award,
The Royal Society, 1961."
So anything one of them sees,
hears or reads, they all know.
Anything, anytime.
Do you still want to take them
to your embassies?
A small difference in the ability
of some men...
...enabled us to beat Hitler
to the atomic bomb.
But this is not a small difference
we're talking about.
This is a gigantic difference.
Russians flew in a study group...
I am as nonviolent as you.
You want war?
If one of the big powers seize them...
...how could the other side do nothing?
Every moment, they'd be falling behind.
They would have to strike
while they still had the chance.
- Perhaps.
- It is not perhaps.
Any time now.
Hey, George!
How did they get through?
All right, downstairs.
What?
Tom.
We better get down there.
Look. Look, George. Soldiers.
Attention!
- Where did you come from?
- Now, listen to me.
- What's the matter?
- You must stay in your room.
Straighten up, Frank.
You're talking to an officer.
- That's right.
- All right, take him to the garden.
Stop him!
- What's happening?
- A couple of drunks, that's all.
Well, what's happened in the church?
You tell me.
Remember, alive if possible.
David.
Tom.
Paul, what are you...?
My God.
- What are they doing?
- Drop it, Colin.
Drop that gun.
Get out. You're armed. Stay outside.
Is he dead?
No. He'd be better off if he was.
- This was your idea?
- I would have planned it better.
Tom.
Rashid.
- This is absolutely necessary, is it?
- I think it best that there should be...
...no doubt in anybody's mind
about the details.
Your blood.
Tom.
- I got your message.
- Has anything happened?
No. I've been there all morning.
- Susan?
- Not a sign.
Yes. Oh, Tom, I don't think
you've met Professor Gruber.
No. How do you do?
Daviïs told me about your work.
I'm very pleased to see you.
From Colin.
The human blood cell,
the basic matter of all life.
All we are begins here.
A cell from Rashiïs blood.
Now I will unite the two.
So, David, you think they just took
over a living cell in a womb.
We may never find the answer...
...but the important point is
they're not human.
They're another species.
- Professor?
- I don't know.
I don't know. I must think about this.
- May I?
- Certainly.
Instead of the nations
fighting over them...
...I think there should be a united effort
to eliminate them.
What are you talking about?
We could sterilize them, but
we couldn't be sure it would work.
- And do you really think they'd let us?
- Why do we have to do anything?
Life is a struggle for survival, Thomas.
They're not human.
They're a superior species.
- They'd beat us every time.
- Mr. Harib...
...can we get agreement on this?
- From this evidence, I...
Are you all crazy?
They have never attacked anyone
unless they were attacked first.
Don't get excited.
A Welsh tirade isn't going to help.
Know how many children died
in road accidents last year?
What's that got to do
with killing five kids in cold blood?
- Kids?
- All right. All right.
So they're a different species.
So what?
We're supposed to be
a superior species...
...yet millions of lower forms of life
manage to exist with us on this planet.
You don't kill them
because they're different.
And how would we manage
to live with them?
If we should happen to disagree,
they'd control us.
Like the dog, like Susan.
And if they marry and propagate...
...whose grandchildren will inherit
the earth? Ours or theirs?
Give me a few hours.
I'll see what I can do.
You of all people, these five...
Well, call them what you like.
- they may be the greatest gift
we've ever had.
And what could we do with them?
One country has tried to get them.
Somebody else is bound to try again.
It is more than five children
I am thinking about.
It is millions.
- Who goes there?
- Dr. Lewellin.
I don't think Mr. Webster's
here today, sir.
No, I know. I was with him myself
just a short time ago.
Yes, sir.
I'm going into the church.
Go a bit steady with that
when I come out, will you?
Paul, I understand how you feel...
...but you must bury him, Paul.
You must.
The dead must be buried, Paul.
Paul, I want to talk to you.
All of you.
Right?
Paul...
...why are you here?
Why did they kill Rashid?
Are you talking, or are they?
- Paul, you've terrified people.
- They've been terrified.
They've been hunted
like some kind of freak vermin.
People believe that you're not human.
I don't know what that means...
...but you must learn not to kill.
- But they kill.
I know. I know we kill...
...but it's wrong. And you're different.
For your own sake, you must not kill.
- They tried not to kill.
- I believe that. I believe that.
But that machine, Paul,
is it hydrogen power?
From the sun?
The thought of what that machine
can do as a weapon...
...has struck horror into half
the governments of the world.
I know we make machines,
horrible machines, but...
- They're going to kill you.
- No.
And his death has taught them
that you can be killed.
You must do something to convince
them that you mean no harm.
If I can, I'll help you.
You mustn't mistrust us all.
Will you go to your embassies?
At least let me take her with me,
will you, please?
Why are you here, Paul?
What do you want?
We don't know.
- Susan.
- They've gone.
- What?
- They've disappeared.
- I don't know what to do.
- Steady. Come and sit down.
- I didn't know where to go.
- Quiet down now.
Steady, Susan.
All right, what's it all about?
They've gone. All of a sudden,
they just disappeared.
What do you mean, disappeared?
After you left,
they just stared at Rashiïs body.
I didn't think
they'd paid any attention to you...
...then suddenly I realized I was alone.
I didn't know what to do.
You went to them? Well, why?
What have you done, man?
Did they say where they were going?
- How could they disappear?
- I don't know.
- And the guards?
- I don't know.
- How did you get through?
- I don't know! I just ran.
They didn't pay any attention.
- Were they going to their embassies?
- No.
I don't know.
Well, don't be a damn fool, Tom.
- Get away from that door.
- You're gonna give them a chance.
A chance to do what?
All right.
You have it your way.
Did you see what they did
to those men in that church?
We're gonna give them a chance.
Just one chance.
Paul.
We intend no harm to you
or the other children.
But the machine, Paul.
We must know how to make
that machine.
Not that we would use it.
Nobody's going to use it.
But the best guarantee
that it won't be used...
...rests in no single power
getting possession of it.
We need your abilities, Paul.
Oh, it's not just this one machine.
We must accept that every weapon
has its time.
They will be making advances
as quickly as they can.
Without your brain,
we would fall dangerously behind.
Paul...
...I'm sure this reading of each other's
minds can be controlled, don't you?
You see, if an enemy knows
our exact capabilities...
...that leaves us open
to surprise attack.
That's a security weakness that
might tempt an enemy to move first.
We'd never think of trying
to force you, of course.
We have your own interests
at heart too, Paul.
Yes, we want you to feel
a completely free agent...
...perfectly at liberty
to follow your own convictions.
Whatever you do,
you'll be well looked after.
We want you to be happy
as well as productive.
They're not human.
They're a superior species.
They'd beat us every time.
They're not human. They're a superior
species. They'd beat us every time.
They're not human.
They're a superior species.
They'd beat us every time.
They're not human.
At this very moment, they could be
controlling a bomber crew...
...and force them to press the button.
That would be it.
- I don't believe it.
- You don't believe it.
And what gave you the right
to take a decision...
...that could destroy
the entire world?
Don't be so emotional
and sentimental...
...because of your feeling
about these kids. They're not kids!
Have you ever seen them laugh,
run, play?
No, by God,
but you've seen them kill...
...violently and hideously.
Have you thought about that,
psychologist?
I don't know what to do.
I wish to God I did.
We've got to do something.
Come on.
- I'm sorry. I was after Dr. Neville.
- I'm afraid he's not here, professor.
- I was hoping...
- Is there anything I can do to help?
- Those cells we saw the other day.
- Yes, what about them?
I can't be certain, of course,
but it's just a hypothesis.
But because of the nature of the cells,
the size, conformation...
...and other factors,
I think they are the cells of man...
...advanced maybe a million years.
That's all right.
But we'll need extra cable if we do.
I want several distractions.
Keep those vehicles moving...
...till we're ready.
- Sir.
Command to all stations.
All vehicles to remain on the move...
Get that truck unloaded
and move it out of here.
Come on, move.
Montez. Yes.
Hold on. Dr. Neville, sir.
Dr. Lewellin and Prof. Gruber to see you.
Gruber?
Well, Dr. Lewellin discovered
Paul Looran.
And Professor Gruber's the head
of my department at the university.
Right. Send them up.
- Get on with that thing.
- Sir.
Finished, sir.
Right. Test the circuit.
Signal station. This is a test.
Prepare for firing signal.
Test signal received.
Circuit functioning A-okay.
Good. Bring the armored units
into firing positions.
All stations. Readiness report.
- G station ready and standing by.
- C station ready and standing by.
J station ready and standing by.
M station. He's not out yet.
- Detonator crew. He's not out yet.
- Dr. Lewellin's here, sir.
- M station not yet operational, sir.
- They're not operational?
- Let me talk to them.
- Sir.
This is the commander.
The minister of defense, the chief
of staff and Colin have all been killed.
There's been murder and chaos
in four embassies.
- That was the chance you gave them.
- They did that and came back?
Yes. That's the one mistake
they've made.
What sense is there in that?
I can't guess what makes sense
to them.
Get that line working,
or we go without you.
Finish the check.
Let's see the area plan.
Colin and the others may have made
the same mistake...
...you're making,
pointed guns at them.
- Colin's not alive to tell me the story.
- So that's the answer, is it?
To put them in a position where
they have no choice but to fight back.
You reminded me
of what happened in there.
Even now, they could be making
all those men out there...
...turn their guns on one another!
- That's a risk I'm prepared to take.
- Oh, you...
- That's a risk we're all prepared to take.
The ammunition carriers
are withdrawing now.
Look, David. Will you listen
to me, please? This is important.
The professor... Professor Gruber thinks
those cells are the cells of man.
- Man advanced maybe a million years.
- Possibly.
Yes.
That's possible. But we're ape
advanced a million years.
From what I've seen, we need protection
against man advanced a million years.
Either we control them or they control
us, and that's the law of nature, Tom.
Ask any ape.
- M station's still not ready, sir.
- Does Mr. Harib know about this?
Mr. Harib's already down
there in the car.
With him is a volunteer
from each embassy.
Not only are they agreed
on this action...
...but they're also agreed that if it
works, it's worth the risk of their lives.
And ours.
I think you ought to keep an eye
on Dr. Lewellin.
M station. He's got the charges in place,
but he hasn 't got the line out yet.
You're the only station not ready.
We can't wait.
Come on, move.
The old man's blowing his top.
If he can work any faster in this muck,
let him come down and do it himself.
I don't know what happened,
but at least hear their side.
I was the one that sent them
to their embassies.
Now bloody stick.
Right. Grab it.
They're out.
Give us a minute to tie up.
You can't do all this
without knowing what they're after.
How do we know why they're here,
what they want?
M station ready and standing by.
- All stations ready, sir.
- Right.
Inform Mr. Harib we go ahead
in 30 seconds.
Sir.
Commander to Harib.
We go in 30 seconds.
- Right. I'll take care of this.
- All arms, load and prepare to fire.
Mr. Harib, we go
in less than half a minute, sir.
- You men, stop those people.
- Tom!
Who's that?
Tom! Get away from that church!
- Go get him.
- Just a minute, captain.
- I'd like that. Please.
- Get back.
Only the task force
is allowed in the area now.
This is my responsibility, captain.
- Paul! Paul!
- Get back.
You've got 10 seconds
to get him out of there.
Count down from 10
and then push that button.
Tom!
Final countdown. Ten...
...nine...
Paul, give me some sign
you can hear me!
- Wait a minute. It's Harib.
- Six, five...
...four, three, two...
- Stop the countdown.
- Stop the countdown. Check, check.
Can you hear me in there?
I want some sign you can hear me.
Paul.
Hey, wait for the signal.
Tell us what you want here.
What do you expect from us?
- Be ready to go without a countdown.
- Let me pass.
All right, Dr. Lewellin.
We'll give them their hearing.
My God. They're all going up there.
Do you understand
why we have done this?
Yes. You are here to destroy us.
Paul, what is your purpose?
Why are you here?
To be destroyed.
Rashid.
What is it?
The Indian boy was dead.
Why are we here?
For the same reason you are here.
You may choose your way.
We have chosen ours.
Fire.
You blasted fool!
Stop firing, you bloody fools! Stop it!
- Stop firing!
- Stop it, do you hear?
Stop it. For Goïs sake, stop it!
Stop!
Cease fire!
- Stop it.
- I'm ordering all units to cease fire.
- I order you to fire.
- The general is ordering me not to fire.
Stop it, you bloody fools!
Stop firing!
Fire.
Stop it. Stop firing. Stop it.
Fire the damn thing.
Stop firing!
You bloody fool!
