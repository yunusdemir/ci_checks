If you were to ask
the five best
filmmakers in the
world right now
to make a movie like this,
it, it wouldn't even be
in the same universe.
I was blown away.
Like, like three minutes in
I turn to my friend and go,
"This is the fucking
greatest movie
I've ever
seen in my life."
It has withstood,
like, ten years.
And people are still
watching a movie
and talking about a movie.
People aren't doing that about
whatever won the Oscar
for Best Picture ten years ago.
What genius is behind this?
Tommy wanted to break...
Tommy wanted to break
barriers in filmmaking.
I think that he had a
very clear vision.
He is a figure of mystery
where, you know,
you do wanna learn
more about him.
Who is this man?
Who is this auteur?
The kind of sheer
ambition of it is...
is incredible.
The numbers probably prove
how unlikely it is that
you'll make it.
If I had a time machine,
I wouldn't
go do a bunch of st...
uh, stuff you...
I would go back
and try and get on that set,
just to watch
and feel what it was like.
'Cause it has
to be unbelievable.

We'll hang ourselves tomorrow.
Unless God-oh comes.
And, and if he comes?
We'll be saved.
Well.
Sh... Shall we go?
Pull on your trousers.
What?
Pull on your trousers.
You want me to
pull off my trousers?
I want you to stop. Stop.
Jesus. That was
painfully unremarkable.
Rob. Y-You're like a robot.
- Yeah.
- And it's "Godot."
- Sorry.
- And Greg.
You're so scared.
And so insecure.
You're like a,
like a wounded puppy.
Do you even want to be an actor?
Uh, yeah, m...
more than anything.
Okay, well, then it must
be a big secret,
because I can't tell at all.
You've been coming to class for,
like, two months now.
And, um...
you need to,
to loosen up and relax.
You gotta really
just expose yourself
or no one's ever gonna care.
- Okay, Greg?
- Yeah, okay.
Okay. Thank you.
Okay, who here can really reveal
themselves to the class?
Anybody?
I go.
Great. What do you
have for us today, Thomas?

That joke?
- No, not at all.
- Then what, Greg?
I don't see point.
Okay. Um... All right, listen.
When, um, when I,
when I get up
on stage in front of people,
it's like all I can
think about is, uh,
"What if, what if they laugh at
me or if I embarrass myself?"
Um, but you, man, you're, like,
fucking fearless, and I just...
I... I wanna feel that, too.
I just, I want, I want that.
I want what, what you have.
And I just, I...
I figured I could,
I could learn something
from you.
- That's... That's it.
- Oh, all right.

Oh, you wanna, you wanna
do a scene here?
Are you not dedicated actor?
I'm dedicated. I just...

Few years ago.

Wow. Look at that.

Yeah, no. You're gonna
take off after this.
This is like...
You're going. That's...
You know, I'm happy for you.
- What about you, though?
- I've been good.
Been working?
I don't know.
My agents are saying
it's kinda like
slow season or whatever. But...
No. There's never a slow season.
It's always shit working.
Do you, like,
call your agents every day?
Yeah, I mean...
Where you start, fire that
fucking spooky friend of yours.
That fucking vampire-looking
motherfucker.
It's like... Who is he?
He's just, I don't know.
He's a friend.
- He's my roommate.
- 'Cause he's fucking...
You can't go anywhere
with that dude.
Hollywood's pussy dries up
when you walk in with this dude.
They just fucking clamp shut
like a fucking...
Hollywood puts on
a fucking chastity belt.
Did you see the new,
uh, Star Wars?
I kinda went for the
Jar Jar Binks thing.
It's pretty funny.
And, well, you know. It doesn't
really get you that far.
It's like too much action.
Like, it never stops.
There's no story.
And it makes me pass out.
A couple friends of mine
went and saw it recently.
Hi.
You big Hollywood producer,
right? I see you on TV.
Ah, yeah. How are you?
Nice to see you.
Tommy Wiseau. Hi.
- Nice to meet you, thank you.
- Hi, young lady.
- Okay...
- I don't want to bullshit.
I don't want to do none
of the bullshit.
I'm very talented,
and I have many good ideas.
We're having dinner.
Okay? You don't walk up
to people's table and do this.
That's not how it works
in this business, okay?
Which way? Tell me how do it.
You can call my agency,
United Talent,
send your resume to United Talent
Agency, to David Krammer...
- Okay, I show you, okay.
- All right.
To be, or not to be.
That is the question.
Whether nobler in mind
to suffer sling and arrow...
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you
to stop that.
Is this gentleman
bothering you?
What the fuck do you think?
- You don't like Shakespeare?
- Sir, I need you to leave.
Okay, I do
the Tennessee Williams.
I don't want Tennessee Williams,
I don't want Shakespeare.
- Stella!
- Okay! Now we're getting...
- Security. Security, no.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Sir, I'm gonna need you
to leave, right now.
Come here. Tommy...
Just because you want it
doesn't mean it can happen.
Okay? It's one in a million,
even if you have
Brando's talent.
It's not gonna
happen for you, okay?
- But now you have to go.
- Well, maybe I could... Maybe...
I'm not saying maybe. I'm
saying not in a million years.
- But after that?
- And not after.
- I'm sorry.
- I accept your apology.
I'm sorry, sir.
Is everything okay now?
Yeah. Thanks for rushing over.
He made it through two fucking
acts of Shakespeare.
Tommy?
Tommy.
Tommy.
Tommy, you okay?
- You think I'm villain?
- What?
This town, Greg...
They don't want me.
They don't understand me.
They...
Maybe I don't have what it take.
Yeah man. I know what you mean.
- You do?
- Yeah.
My agent won't return
my calls and...
All I hear is no, all day,
every day. It's...
It's fucking hard, man.
Nobody like me, Greg.
Nobody give me chance.
My whole life.
But... Hey.
We can't give up, right?
Maybe not worth it, Greg.
No, hey. Tommy, look at me.
Look at me.
When they told James Dean
he wasn't good enough,
did he listen to them?
- No.
- No.
No. Fuck that, all right?
He kept fighting,
and he showed them all.
And that's what we're gonna do.
Remember?
All right, we said we were
gonna push each other.
Never give up on
our dreams, right?
Come on.
I just don't know how, Greg.
Wish we could just
make our own movie.
That great idea.
It'll be great drama.
Like the Tennessee Williams.
So there this guy Johnny.
A true American hero.
To be played by me.
He has it all.
Good look, good job,
many friends.
Greg, how long is movie script?
And then this girl,
this beautiful girl,
she betray him.
But then this Lisa
sleep with best friend.
We call best friend Mark.
After Mark Damon from
Talented Ripley Man.
And then this guy Johnny,
he go crazy.
He decide to kill himself
in front of the world.
And then he show them all.
That's great.
And also maybe
Johnny is vampire. We'll see.
"Anything for my princess."
After everything he do
for everybody,
why would they do this to him?
My mind! Can't think.
"Two is nice,
but three a crowd."
"Two is nice,
but three a crowd."
But it's real life. People act
so strange these days.
You finished.
This my masterpiece.
Greatest drama
since the Tennessee William.
- The Room.
- The Room.
Nobody read it yet.
So today, you be first one.
Yeah. All right.
So read it.
Oh, you want me to
read it right now?
Yeah, what you think?
Okay. The Room.
I'll do anything for my girl.
You should marry Johnny.
Did you know that chocolate
is the symbol of love?
We can't do this anymore.
I keep thinking about your
strong hands around my body.
Anyway, how's your sex life?
I don't think she's
faithful to me.
Life is complicated.
The unexpected happens.
In a few minutes, bitch.
If a lot of people
loved each other,
the world would be a better
place to live.
Done.
Well what you think?
I mean, it's great. That's...
I just, I can't...
I can't believe it, man.
You... You did this!
And of course you play Mark.
You, you want me
to play Mark in this?
Hey, big role. Second lead.
Well, yeah, it's a huge role.
Are you... Are you sure you...
If you don't want to do it,
fine.
Maybe Johnny Depp available.
No, no, no. I want it.
I... I want the role.
I'll take it.
It's like you say,
Hollywood reject us,
then we do it on our own.
Wait, you...
You have the money to make this?
I have. It's no problem.
You're really gonna
make this thing?
No, Greg. We are going to do it.
Together.
...and we're gonna have
everything you need.
We have a vast
assortment of lenses.
We've got cameras,
both digital and film.
- Here's our facility owner.
- Hey, Bill.
Come on over and meet
Tommy and Greg.
These are the guys
I was telling you about.
- Oh, hi.
- How you doing, man?
Hey, pleasure to meet you.
- How long is the shoot?
- As long as it takes.
All right.
We just wanna
make it right, you know?
Well, I think you're
gonna find everything
you need
here at Birns and Sawyer.
Our rental packages
start at about...
Wait, wait.
I stop you right there.
- Okay.
- We don't rent. We buy.
Is that not normal, or...
Industry standard is pretty much
that you
would rent the equipment
because it's so prohibitively
expensive to own.
Okay. I say no problem.
Okay. I guess we'll buy.
Wanna shoot 35 or HD?
Well, we'll shoot
both on this film.
Digital and film?
But you'd need, twice the crew,
uh... twice the equipment,
I mean, hell, both...
They're lit differently.
It's just not done.
- I have vision.
- Tommy's a pioneer, man.
He, that's... He wants to go
outside the box.
That's what he does.
So what? We have deal or what?
Uh, let us discuss...
Yeah. Just give us a minute,
you know? It's just...
You know, not normally
how we do business.
- This is weird.
- Who buys equipment?
Apparently this guy.
I don't know
about this guy.
Does he have the money?
I don't know
if he has the money.
We are a business, we sell
stuff, let's sell it to him.
Okay. I have an idea.
Follow my lead.
- What are you doing?
- Okay, okay.
Okay. So...
We are able to sell you
all the equipment you need.
- Okay!
- There we go!
Now you say yes.
And we're also
willing to give it to you
at a reduced rate,
if you decide to shoot
here in our studio.
- What do you think?
- We shoot here?
Yeah. We want to be in business
with you, Tommy.
Okay. We make American movie
with American discount.
- Perfect.
- Okay. That's a deal, all right?
- The character is Lisa.
- Okay. Is she...
you know, like, romantic,
or a scientist, or...
She's Lisa.
- Okay.
- All right. Now we do scene.
Okay.
Okay, okay. Well, Johnny should
be here any minute.
Now you're riding horse.
Okay. Someone knock on door
while you're riding horse.
Who is it?
It's like rain. Like sexy rain.
So, I just want to introduce you
to some people.
Raphael, he's one
of our most experienced DPs.
- Ah, Director of Photography
- Oh, right, DP.
This is Sandy Schklair.
He's a script supervisor on...
- How many, Sandy?
- Forty-seven shows.
- Oh, wow. So many.
- Forty-seven.
That's a lot of movies.
- I'm Lisa.
- Oh, that like cowboy.
- She... She's a bit of a cowboy?
- No. You do it like cowboy.
I'm Lisa.
I don't want cowboy.
You're do like cowboy.
- Are you cowboy?
- No.
Don't. Just do the
opposite of that.
- Do the opp...
- Yeah, yeah.
Okay. Now you're
playing saxophone.
Am I still the cowboy?
No. Just play saxophone.
Amy does hair and makeup.
This is Safoya.
She does costumes.
What do you think,
my character dress like this?
Um... Maybe we can get rid
of one of the belts.
What? No. No way.
Make my butt look good.
Okay!
Pretend I'm boyfriend.
And... what do you do?
You remember Bill?
You know Bill. Come on.
- I sold you the equipment.
- Yeah.
- Right.
- Bill, I didn't know it was you.
And action.
I'm sorry, my darling.
All right. No. Start it over.
Do it like Shakespeare,
but sexy.
Okay.

- That was great!
- Don't break character!
- Is Johnny there?
Okay. Everybody hired.
- Just like that?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- That was easy.
You wanna, like, talk about
the vision of the movie, though?
Don't worry. We have plenty of time.
We talk about all this.
As the script supervisor,
it would be really helpful
if I could look at the script
for the movie first.
Everybody want script.
Don't be greedy, okay?
What we do, it's a little
unconventional, and so...
Okay.
You're licking ice cream cone.
Okay, but it's really hot out,
so it's melting.
- Oh, okay.
- You have to lick it.
You better lick fast.
Oh, no.
But now it's like brain freeze.
- Too much at once.
- Yeah. Get it all.
Yeah, you gotta
throw it all in...
Is this a real movie?
- I really wanna be in a...
- No. I stop you.
I don't make porno.
- Okay.

- No. Don't try it again.
You know what, you're hired.
- Aww, thank you so much!
- Okay!
♪ Can you feel it,
see it, hear it today ♪
♪ If you can't
Then it doesn't matter anyway ♪
♪ You will never understand it
'Cause it happens too fast ♪
♪ And it feels so good
It's like walking on glass ♪

but you can't have it ♪
Okay. Everyone, gather around.
Gather around, everyone.
Come on, don't be shy.
Everyone, come in.

movement and stuff.
Okay! Today,
our top of mountain day.
Today we take first steps
on a great journey.
After today, which one of
ourselves will ever be same?
This play work if chemistry
between character make sense.
Human behavior. Betrayal.
It applies to all of us.
It's in ourselves.
You love someone, what is love?
You need to have spirit. Hope.
Be optimist.
But can you handle
all your human behavior
and behavior of others?
Right? Right?
See what I'm saying?
You don't wanna be good.
We're gonna be great.
Okay. I have one announcement.
This is bathroom.
I spend many dollars on this.
It's for me only.
Director only. Okay?
You know there's, like,

Okay, sorry.
I have ears,

Are you gonna film with all that
stuff in your pocket?
I keep my stuff, sweetie.
Okay. Can I at least take

Continuity in your forehead.

Are you feeling good?
I am. I am. Yeah.
Feels like it's coming together.
- Good.
- Yeah.
Tommy is...
- Tommy is...
- Settling.
Yeah. He's, he's stressed.
You know?
He, he did his first scene,
which, uh, took a million takes.
But, oh, acting it.
But, you know, he's, he's,
the director too.
And so that's like...
It's a lot.
A lot to think about.
Acting, directing, producing.
So he's doing, he's doing great.
He'll get there.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
What do you do if it
turns out really bad?
- Like...
- It's not gonna be bad.
Like, if it turns out terrible.
- Would you, can you...
- That would, that would...
- ...take it off your IMDB?
- ...suck but...
But it feels good.
It feels good.
And it's, like, you know
when it's working or not,
and it's, it's really working.
- Good.
- Yeah.
I used to know a girl,
she had a dozen guys.
One of them found out about it,
beat her up so bad
she ended up in a hospital
on Guerrero Street.
- What a story, Mark.
- Cut.
Why is he laughing?
- I have no idea.
- Weird time to laugh.
Uh...
Why don't we go one
more time, and uh,
let's just get a different
reaction to the story, okay?
Uh... Let's uh, let's roll
with tail slate.
- Rolling.
- Okay.
- Everyone set?
- Yeah.
Ready, and, uh, action.
I used to know a girl,
she had a dozen guys.
One of them found out about it,
beat her up so bad,
she ended up in a hospital
on Guerrero Street.
- What a story, Mark.
- Cut!
Oh, God. Okay. Uh...
Hey, uh...
So, the story he's telling you,
- the one you yourself wrote.
- Yeah?
It's not a funny story, Tommy.
Yeah. I thought, I thought this
was a serious scene, Tommy.
- Yeah. Why are you laughing?
- Okay.
Well, sometimes people
do crazy things. Right?
Human behavior.
Okay, fair enough.
Maybe just get one
where you don't laugh at the story.
Okay?
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay.
- Okay?
- Yeah.
Okay, we still rolling?
We're still rolling.
- Okay, we're set.
- Okay, we'll pick it up.
- Go.
- All right. Set speed.
Ready, and action.
I used to know a girl,
she had a dozen guys.
One of them found out about it,
beat her up so bad,
she ended up at a hospital
on Guerrero Street.
What a story, Mark.
- Cut!
- He's not gonna listen to you.
We're gonna be here all night.
Just call it.
All right. Cut, check it.
Great. I think we got it.
Okay, great. Check gate.
It's human behavior.
He knows nothing
about filmmaking.
He's a complete idiot. I don't
even think he's seen a movie.
He's clearly never
been on a set before.
What? Have you ever heard
about someone
producing, directing...
This guy doesn't know anything.
Talking all the time.
Who gives this guy money?
Oh, I don't even want
to get into that.
That's something
I don't even want to probe.
Oh, wow.
I love burrito.
Uh, Tommy. So, um...
The reason we brought you here
is because we've,
we've been talking,
and... we decided that we want
to move in together.
Oh...
I sorry.
Impossible.
I have no room
for three people in my place.
Oh, no. That's, that's not
what I mean. Um...
No, Greg's gonna
move in with me.
Yeah...
What?
Well, you, you know.
We've been going out
for a little while now,
and it just...
Kinda felt like the
right next step.
The right time.
Exactly.
What about movie?
What about it?
What... Living together
and the movie
have nothing to do
with each other.
Oh.
Tommy, I'll, I'll see you
on Monday.
I'll be there.
I have to go to bathroom.
Wait. Tommy, Tommy.
Dude, just cause I'm moving out
doesn't mean we're not gonna see
each other anymore.
It's all right.
It could've been worse,
I guess.
Yeah.
Everybody betray me!
Oh, my foot.
I hurt my foot.
Just another day at the office.
- Can you not right now?
- I need more lights over here.
- You, help him, you, too.
- Greg.
I need this look like Titanic.
- The Titanic?
- Yeah, that one.
- Yeah, yeah, trust me. It does.
- Okay.
- Okay, okay. We go.
- Tommy, Tommy,
this is not necessary.
Ver... Very necessary. Very...
I need to show my ass
to sell this movie.
- That's not true...
- At least we have a closed set.
Not closed set. Open set.
Life is not closed set.
I want everyone to see.
You especially.
Wh... Why? What?
Brad Pitt do this
in The Legend of the Fall.
Julie, are you okay?
Could we maybe just put on
some music to get in the mood?
Like maybe a little
Alicia Keys...
I'm sorry, we're not
here to promote
other people's work. All right?
We go. Okay? Rolling?
Wait. Wait. Wait. Cut, cut.
What is this?
- What is this? This disgusting?
- It's my body.
No, this, pimples on the...
Makeup!
Makeup, come fix this
disgusting body.
Tommy! Stop it. What the fuck?
Juliette, I'm so sorry. I'm so...
Dude, what... What are you doing?
Why are you acting like this?
This American movie.
She need to look sexy. Beautiful
- Come here. Come on.
- What?
- Fuck, man.
- I know I'm hard on her.
Yeah you're hard...
It's not just that.
What's going on with you?
Stanley Kubrick.
He nice to actor?
Alfred Hitchcock?
Let me tell you something, Greg.
He do this movie, Birds.
Yeah, I'm aware of The Birds.
On this movie,
he terrified the actors.
- He locked them in rooms.
- Tommy...
He throw birds at them.
Real birds!
Nasty stuff.
The actors, they cry every day.
This movie win every award.
Is Mr. Hitchcock bad man?
No. He great director!
Yeah, but he was an asshole
and I bet he didn't direct
with his fucking dick out.
Oh, really? Well, maybe we check
the record, okay?
You know, for your information,
the word director come from dictator.
Rest my case.
You can't treat them like this.
It's not right.
I treat them how I treat them.
If anyone needs to
be upset here,
- it's me, quite frankly.
- What?
I give them job.
I give them salary.
I already spend five million
dollar on this movie, Greg.
Five... Are you kidding me?
Five million dollars?
And they are not grateful.
Nobody respect my vision.
I know what they say, Greg,
I hear them.
Nobody trust me.
Not even you, Greg!
- That's... What are you...
- See, you don't even trust me.
- Hey, Tommy, Tommy, hey!
- Let's go! Let's go.
- Be nice to her! Be nice to her!
- Juliette, let's go.
- Let's go.
- Juliette. Hey, hey...
If you're not comfortable,
tell me, okay?
- I can do it. It's fine.
- All right, roll it.
Ready, and action.
I think you're
aiming a little bit high.
I aim where I aim.
Just do the scene.
Why is he having sex
with her bellybutton?
Oh, my God.
He knows where
her vagina is, right?
Okay. Cut. I need more passion.
And this, this still disgusting.
- You don't clean it.
- Fuck that, okay.
You embarrass that girl in front
of the entire crew,
you're a dead man.
Oh, really? I'm dead man, I'm dead man?
Everyone, everyone calm down.
Jesus. Come on.
Juliette, you need a break.
Take a break.
I'm okay.
She okay.
All right, well,
I need a break.
- Then you're fired!
- What?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I know what you say.
I hear you. And you.
And you, and you.
I hear everybody.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wh... What the fuck are
you talking about?
Where Marcus? Marcus!
Marc... Film, now.
This Marcus.
I hire him to documentary
the making of The Room.
He capture every comment.
"Oh, yeah, Tommy weird."
"Tommy like Frankenstein."
"He like...
He like vampire rapist."
I hear everything!
I have ears everywhere!
I hear your whispers
in your souls!
- You're on my planet! Okay?
- Wait, wait.
So you've been spying
on your entire production?
- Yeah, that's right.
- That's fucking crazy.
That how it is. So now you know.
Next time you make laughter,
ha, ha, ha, ha, ha...
I don't care who you are,
you're out on street.
What about me? Am I still fired?
All right, I give you
one more chance.
Take three's up.
Let's go.
Make sure you see my ass.
- See you at the car?
- Okay.
Tommy.
Tommy, we're leaving.
I feel like, um...
I feel like we should
at least talk about this.
Look at my arm.
Not bad.
Look like big strong kid.
Yeah, man.
All right. I'll, uh...
I'll see you.
I haven't seen any water.
I'm pretty sure that's illegal.
- Yeah, fuck this place.
- There's no AC in here.
He's too fucking cheap.
Nobody wants to help me.
And I'm dying.
Hey. It's like 100 fucking
degrees in here.
He show up yet?
No. I wish. Hey, guys,
if he doesn't get here soon,
I just say we call lunch.
What do you say?
- Lunch!
- Yeah.
- You wanna just keep rehearsing?
- Sure, sure.
- Um...
- Um, you're not dying, Mom.
I got the results
of the test back.
I definitely have breast cancer.
- Hi, everybody.
- Oh!
- Hey, you're here.
- Hey, everybody. Here camera.
Okay, you ready?
Where have you been, man?
Where have I been? You know,
just getting ready
in my apartment.
I live there alone now.
- Tommy.
- Yeah, question?
Does this come back?
What are...
What she talking about?
This story line.
- The breast cancer.
- Breast cancer? No. It's twist.
So it never comes back?
I don't have time
to explain script to you, okay?
What is this makeup? You look
like you're swimming in lake.
- It's 100 degrees in...
- Makeup!
Tommy! If you're not going
to pay for air conditioning
you at least have to
pay for water.
Yeah, could we just
have a little
bit of water before the scene?
I...
Okay I stop you. I stop
everybody right there, okay?
Nobody in Hollywood will give
you water either, okay?
That's not true.
Dude, we can't work like this.
I'm not Santa Claus, all right?
Maybe you go buy water
for everybody, Greg.
Okay? Maybe girlfriend bring
you water or something.
We gotta get going, okay?
We're already four hours behind.
- Okay, well, whose fault that?
- Yours.
- My fault?
- You're late every goddamn day.
All right, that your five cents.
- I'm fucking director.
- Exactly.
- Exactly!
- Exactly!
Exactly. Turn these lights
on right now!
If I turn on the lights,
it's gonna get hotter.
- Be professional, do your job.
- You do your job!
Tommy, it's hot enough as is.
Greg, so you know
about light too?
Huh? You know everything.
Huh? You know water,
light, girlfriend.
Oh, my God!
Carolyn just fainted!
- Hey, hey.
- Tommy, please get
her some water.
Tommy, get some fucking water.
Come on.
- Carolyn? Carolyn.
- What she doing, taking nap?
She's not taking a fucking nap,
you fucking idiot.
She passed out.
She's not dead.
No. I can feel her heartbeat.
It's not 'cause water.
It's 'cause she old lady.
Tommy, please!
You know what, that's it.
I'm pulling the plug.
Turn off the lights.
Open the doors. That's lunch.
I'm cooling it out in here.
She okay?
Can we get the medic?
Turn off these lights!
The best thing I can say about
this is nobody will ever see it.
We can walk off.
We can walk off...
I'm just tired is all.
I haven't been sleeping
well recently.
- I'll be fine.
- Hey, can I ask you something?
Why, why do you do it?
You have a husband
and grandkids.
You live 50 miles from here,
and you wake up at 5:00 am
to drive all this way.
For what?
We're actors, Greg.
You and me. People like us.
Even the worst day
on a movie set
is better than the best day
anywhere else.
Hey, Greg.
Can we ask you something?
- Yeah?
- What is this movie about?
- I have a theory.
- Oh?
Autobiographical.
Someone in his life was a Denny,
a kid brother
he was always looking out for.
Someone was a Mark.
A better looking friend
he was always jealous of.
I'm sure there was
a Michelle and a Mike.
So, does that mean
there's a Lisa?
Somebody who broke his heart?
Stabbed him in the back
and ruined his life?
Well, that's pretty
obvious to me.
That's the universe.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
It's Bryan fucking Cranston.
Oh, hey, I know him.
Oh, yeah, no shit.
Malcolm in the Middle.
No. From Pilates.
- Brian!
- What are you... Wait!
- Hi!
- Amber! How are you?
- So good to see you.
- You too.
This is my boyfriend, Greg.
- Hey, Greg, how are you?
- Good, yeah.
Greg is also an actor.
- You are?
- Yeah.
Cool. Anything I would
have seen you in?
- Ah, no. I doubt it.
- Well, you know, it's a journey.
Are you working on
anything at the moment?
Yes, yeah, actually
I'm, I'm doing this movie.
- Movie? Nice!
- Yeah.
Yeah, but, you know,
I'd love to do TV at some point.
Yeah, you know.
Sitcoms, drama, cop shows,
Yeah, you name it,
I would doit.
It's funny you mention that.
'Cause, um... I'm directing an
episode of Malcolm right now.
Next week we're shooting a scene
where the boys get lost,
and Hal and Lois have to
go find them in the woods,
and we're having trouble
finding this lumberjack role.
And you got this this beard.
What do you think?
You wanna, you wanna do it?
Are you serious?
Yeah, well, you know,
everybody needs a break.
A... Are you good?
- I should've asked that first.
- Yes, yes, no.
He's very good.
Listen man, I'm sorry,
I'm freaking out a little bit.
I'm a big fan.
- This is like, it's crazy.
- All right.
All right. You and the beard
next Tuesday and Wednesday.
I will be there.
Great to see you!
- Thank you, man, seriously.
- You're welcome.
- See you next week.
- Thanks, thanks again.
Okay, I'm set.
Action.
Screw the whole world!
Why?
Why? Why is this
happening to me?
Why?
God, forgive me.
Why is he
getting back up?
- Cut.
- No. Don't cut. Don't cut.
Why you cut, Sandy?
This is great. This real acting.
If you're gonna writhe around
with the dress,
maybe do it before
you shoot yourself
in the head
and blow your brains out.
I disagree.
We go. Okay. Still rolling.
Here we go.
And action.
I wanted to keep that dress.
You can never wear
that dress again.
Okay. Now I do kill part.
Oh, great, yeah.
Let's cover that again.
Give me countdown.
Three, two, one, bang.
Wow.
- Cut.
- And cut.
- I think we got it.
- I guess so, yeah.
Get me a C-stand
over there, please.
Dude, that was, amazing.
- You think so?
- Totally. Yeah.
It was... It was raw...
and intense.
And, yeah, you really
brought it, man. Seriously.
- Thank you.
- So, uh...
So listen. I know, I know this
is last minute, but, um..
I just wanted to talk to you
about something real quick.
What is it, Greg? You can see
I'm very busy right now.
Yeah. Yeah, um...
So, so you know how
the big beard shaving
scene is tomorrow?
- Yeah, I know the schedule.
- Right.
So I was just... I was hoping
that we can maybe
move it to next week.
And that I can maybe
get the day off tomorrow.
Why? You sick?
Oh, no.
Greg, I can't afford you
get sick right now.
You're lead actor,
I'm director.
I feel great, man.
It's not that.
- I feel great.
- Why, why? Why you need day off?
I, I actually... I landed a small
role in a TV show.
It's, uh, Malcolm in the Middle.
You're movie actor now.
Why you do this, this TV?
Well, it's... It's kind of
a big show. It's...
You know, it would be
great exposure.
It would be like a really good
stepping stone
for my career, I think.
What you do
in this Little Malcolm?
I'm, I'm playing, like,
a lumberjack.
And, um...
That's why the beard...
That's why I need it.
Uh, which is why
I can't shave tomorrow.
But if we, if we just
move the schedule
just like a day or two,
it would...
It would really mean
a lot to me.
Oh, I'm sorry, Greg.
I can't help you.
- What... Why? What?
- Clean-shaven Mark.
You know, he make grand entrance
at beginning of third act.
Very important. It's metaphor.
I know. I know. But we can just,
we can do it next week.
- It's not a big deal...
- No, I can't, Greg!
- Impossible. I'm sorry.
- Tommy.
I can't give you special
treatment, Greg.
What? I can't give special
treatment to everybody.
Everybody here working hard.
One favor. I'm just asking
for a tiny favor, as a friend.
- Favor, favor.
- Yes.
Favor.
You always ask for favor.
This is one tiny thing,
that's it.
I take you to Los Angeles,
give you place to stay.
I write you this part.
I do this whole movie
for you, Greg.
What? You did it for me?
Come on, man.
For us. We do it together.
Okay. Yes. It's our movie.
It doesn't change that.
- Don't betray me, Greg.
- I'm not betraying you.
What I say, we do this together.
We do this together
and now you betray me.
I'm not...
So are you gonna
let me do it or not?
Not up to me, Greg.
It up to you.
You have to choose.
You do this TV show
Little Malcolm
or you do the movie.
Our movie, Greg.
Greg.
- I...
- Unbelievable.
She had to go?
- Whoa!
- Wow.
Hey, guys. You like it?
- Yeah.
- You look great.
Look like... Baby Face.
You guys wanna
play some football?
In tuxes?
No, you gotta be kidding.
- Mark, come on, let's do it.
- I'm up for it.
- Johnny?
- Ask Peter.
Peter, come on.
- No. I don't think so.
- Please.
- No.
- Come on!
Cut.
You good, Tommy?
Yeah. Good day, everybody.
See you tomorrow.
All right. Great job.
I don't believe it.
Let's go to a bar
and erase the memory of today.
- Hey, Sandy, Raphael.
- Yep?
Can I talk to you minute?
Road trip.
San Francisco, here we come.
Hey, who are these guys?
Oh, that's Todd,
that's friend of Todd.
And... other friend of Todd
Where's Sandy and Raphael?
Uh... It's over for those guys.
Did you fire them?
Who's to say?
Come on, forget about them.
- Why?
- We have Todd now.
Look, it's gonna be
like the old days.
San Francisco.
We take stroll down memory lane.
Wait till you see new script pages, Greg.
You love it.
Be very dramatic.
Let's do it. Okay, Todd.
Yeah, you put camera there,
okay?
Yep. It's here.
Okay, we throw
a ball over here.
Come on, Greg. Come on, Greg.
Remember, Greg?
We played football.
- First time we met.
- Yeah, yeah, I remember.
Okay. Okay.
Todd, can you roll it?
Rolling.
- Tommy, what are we doing here?
- We do new scene.
About Mark failure.
What?
Mark want to make
dreams come true.
And Johnny help him.
- Yeah, I don't think so, man.
- Let's do it.
Come on.
Take from your real life.
Drop it. Stop. Don't do this.
I'm asking you nicely.
Stop it. Drop it.
Remember? You want
to be actor, but...
nobody believe in you, Greg.
You know.
You're not good enough.
Like, do that. That stuff.
What? No. Tommy, drop it.
Movies are emotion.
Okay, you need
to be real for us.
- God.
- Look... Greg.
Frankly, you have not been
that real the whole movie.
- Now your chance.
- Fuck you, Tommy.
No one believe in you,
and mom think you're loser.
- Go.
- I said no!
Greg, damn it!
Why you throw this tricky stuff?
All right, man.
You wanna get real?
You wanna get real
for the cameras, let's get real.
Hey, you guys getting this?
Yeah? Good.
Let's get real.
Where were you born, Tommy?
No... Greg, that not
part of scene.
No way. This is your idea.
Where you from?
It's a simple question.
- I'm from New Orleans.
- New Orleans.
From the bayou.
You guys hear that?
This guy with this fucking
accent is from the bayou.
Greg.
Hey, you want
an easier question...
Let's see, where does
the money come from? Huh?
Greg, stop. This on camera.
I know it's on camera.
Just like you want it.
All right. Just tell me
this one thing.
How old are you?
- I'm your age, Greg.
- You're my age?
You're my age?
- I'm just your friend.
- When were you born?
- What year, Tommy?
- Same year as you.
Same year as me?
There is no fucking way
you're in your 20s, all right?
You are a fucking villain.
Fucking Frankenstein
looking motherfucker.
I'm not villain!
I believed in you, man.
I trusted you! For what?
Greg.
I gave you everything.
Are you fucking...
You ruined everything!
Greg.
You owe me your life.
Man, I don't
owe you shit anymore.
All right, and this movie
better be fucking awesome.
It will be awesome.
Cut it. Cut it.
Movie over.
Why am I trying to become
what I don't wanna be?
What am I doing
in an office making
a contemptuous begging
fool of myself,
when all I want is out there?
Honey, I am so
excited to come see your play.
See? Acting doesn't have
to be big movies.
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
It's probably better
if no one even sees
that thing you did with
Tommy, right?
I mean, come on, that thing
can't be good.
Greg? Greg?
Hey, good show, guys.
- That was fun tonight, right?
- Good job.
All right, see you tomorrow.
Baby Face.
You stalking me now?
You're not that hard to find.
- You watch the show?
- No.
You know I don't like comedy.
So how Amber?
I don't know.
She moved to Austin.
Didn't work out.
- I'm sorry to hear this.
- Yeah...
That why you came here, Tommy?
You wanted to talk about Amber?
No. You didn't RSVP.
Yeah. I'm not coming.
And... Honestly, maybe...
Maybe you shouldn't have
a premiere at all.
Greg.
We made pact.
Remember?
To never lose sight
of our dream.
On Friday, they premiere
our movie.
Our movie, Greg.
In real life theater.
I know you don't
like me anymore.
So don't do it for me.
Do it for you, Greg.
You finally get to see yourself
on big screen.
This was your dream too, Greg.
What the fuck am I doing?
- Can you believe it?
- I can't, no.
Here, this for you.
No, you can, you can keep that.
No, don't worry.
I made boxes of them.
Okay.
You think Sandy be there?
I don't know.
Holy shit, is this for us?
Yeah, this for us.
Driver, slow down.
Did you get
a fucking spotlight?
Yeah, this real Hollywood
premiere, Greg.
Raphael, Sandy, Juliette.
Everyone's there...
Go, driver, go. Keep going.
- Go, go, go. Keep going.
- Tommy, what...
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Tommy Wiseau.
- That was fucking weird.
- Yep.
At this point,
it would be fucking weird
if he didn't do something
that was fucking weird.
Tommy, what the fuck
are we doing?
What, we gotta
build anticipation.
There not enough people.
Yep.
Greg, we are stars of the movie.
We can't be first ones there.
- You're right. You're right.
- There not enough people.
Just trust me.
- He's back?
- Over there!
Tommy, come on.
We're gonna do this, yeah?
It's time.
He's not gonna get
out of the car.
The fuck is happening?
Tommy, come on, let's do this.
You ready?
Okay.
Hey, everyone.
Sorry I late. Traffic crazy.
Well, let's go. Let's do it.
No one be nervous. Come on.
Let's go. Let's do it.
Come on, Greg.
Very first premiere.
You excited?
Yeah, Tommy. Sure.
Hi.
Wow. This is a day
I never thought would come.
This is a pretty good turnout,
I gotta say.
Wow. So many people.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's packed.
Hey, you played Chris R, right?
- Yeah.
- Oh.
I didn't recognize you without the beanie.
And the beard.
- Oh. Yeah.
- Yeah.
I play the psychologist. Peter.
- I'm in this too.
- Oh, cool, man.
I feel like I'm
a little overdressed.
No.
Are you kidding me?
You're the star of the movie.
If I could have your attention.
Please welcome the writer,
director, producer, and star
of tonight's extravaganza.
His name is Mr. Tommy Wiseau.
This my movie.
And this my life.
Uh...
Okay. Be cool.
I'm so nervous.
Okay, let's begin.
- Two title cards. Great.
- I have two logos.
I noticed. Yeah.
Hi, babe.
I have something for you.
- What is it?
- Just a little something.
Johnny it's beautiful,
thank you.
Wow.
You look so sexy Lisa.
Isn't it fabulous?
I would do anything for my girl.
Oh, hey, guys.
Oh, hi, Denny.
Wow. Look at you.
It's from Johnny.
Anything for my princess.
Okay, I'm ready.
This dress is so pretty.
I can't wait for you
to get it off of me.
Okay. Oh, wow.
I just like to watch you guys.
- Oh, Denny, Denny, Denny boy.
- I don't like this.
Two's great,
but three's a crowd.
Fine. I have homework
to do, anyway.
- Bye, lovebirds.
- Bye, Denny.
I'm sorry. What's his
relationship to you guys?
Oh, no. No, no, no.
- Hi.
- Can I help you?
Yeah. Can I have a
dozen red roses, please?
Oh, hi, Johnny.
I didn't know it was you.
Who doesn't recognize that guy?
- Here you go.
- That's me.
- How much is it?
- That'll be $18.
There you go. Keep the change.
Hi, doggie.
You're my favorite customer.
Thanks a lot. Bye.
Nobody wants to help me.
And I'm dying.
You're not dying, Mom.
I got the results of
the test back.
I definitely have breast cancer.
It never comes back.
I don't know why I say that.
Is it just me,
or is this kinda bad?
Oh, yeah, it's bad.
It's still going?
Why, Lisa? Why, Lisa?
Please talk to me, please!
You're part of my life.
You're everything.
You are lying. I never hit you.
You are tearing me apart, Lisa!
Why are you so hysterical?
You understand why? Do you?
Where's my money?
Where's my fucking money, Denny?
You have no idea what kind of
trouble you're in here, do you?
- I owe him some money.
- What kind of money?
What kind of money?
- Go.
- Go deep!
I did not hit her.
It's not true. It's bullshit.
I did not hit her.
I did not!
Oh, hi, Mark.
- Don't worry about it, man.
- Don't touch me, mother fucker.
Get out.
Stop it!
I'll kill you. I'll break every
bone in your body.
Bastard! You betray me.
You're not good.
If you'd keep your
girl satisfied,
she wouldn't come to me!
Get outta my house.
You couldn't kill me
if you tried.
It's not over.
Everybody betray me.
I fed up with the world.
Hey, Tommy.
They hate it.
No.
No. They're...
They're just laughing.
Yeah. They're laughing.
Laughing at me.
Maybe it's true, you know.
Maybe everybody right.
Maybe I just big joke. Ha, ha.
No, Tommy...
I try to open my heart,
show them my soul.
And... they just hate me.
Even you hate me, Greg.
Hey, hey, hey.
Listen to me, all right?
All right, that thing out there,
that's your movie.
You made that.
All right, like you said,
you did that all by yourself.
You know how special that is?
Hey. It's fucking incredible.
How many people can
say they have
done something like that?
I don't know.
One thousand.
All right, and yeah.
Maybe it didn't turn out
exactly as you hoped.
But just
listen for a second.
Sound like they're laughing.
All right, come here.
Look how much fun
they're having.
They fucking love it, man.
Why, Lisa? Why, why?
How often do you think Hitchcock
got a response like this?
Never.
Greg...
Why you help me?
'Cause we're friends.
Why?
Why is this happening to me?
Why?
Here we go. "Why?"
It's over.
God.
Do it!
Do it! Do it!
Tommy!
Get up there. Go, man.
Okay.
Wow.
I'm glad you liked
my comedic movie.
Exactly how I intend it.
You know, I have vision
for this movie.
But...
I never make this movie...
without my friend.
We followed our dream.
Come down here, Baby Face.
Come on, Baby Face!
I never be able to make this
movie without my best friend.
We do it together.
Okay. The Room!
Okay.
- Hi.
- Can I help you?
Yeah. Can I have a dozen
red roses, please?
Oh, hi, Johnny. I didn't know
it was you.
Everything goes wrong at once.
Nobody wants to help me.
And I'm dying.
Stop, no, stop.
I can't talk right now.
Why, Lisa, why, Lisa?
Please talk to me. Please.
You're part of my life.
You're everything. I could not
go on without you, Lisa.
I mean, the candles.
The music.
The sexy dress.
I mean, what's going on here?
You're not dying, Mom.
I got the results of
the test back.
I definitely have breast cancer.
You have nice legs, Lisa.
You have nice pecs.
I'm tired. I'm wasted.
I love you, darling.
Come on, make love to me.
Come on, you owe me one.
I love you, Lisa.
- Go.
- Go deep!
Gee, Peter, you're clumsy.
That's it, I'm done.
Good idea, Denny.
I like you. Very much.
Lover boy.
What are you doing this for?
What's the matter?
Don't you like me?
I'm your girl.
Johnny's my best friend.
Right. You're getting married
next month, come on.
You're scaring me.
You are lying. I never hit you.
You are tearing me apart, Lisa!
Why are you so hysterical?
Do you understand why?
Do you?
I did not hit her.
It's not true. It's bullshit.
I did not hit her.
I did not!
Oh, hi, Mark.

Hey, how you doing?
Hi. Yeah, I'm fine. Why you ask?
Why you standing
against the wall?
Look, I'm just a guy leaning
against wall, no big deal.
Why you so lonely? Tell me.
What, I'm just standing here alone.
Don't mean I'm lonely.
You need help. I... I see it.
It's not pity party.
This just party.
- You wanna go with me?
- Go where?
My house.
I'm not going anywhere with you.
You think you have long hair,
you own the world?
That's the idea?
I stop you.
I stop you right there.
What is this accent?
It sound familiar.
- You from New Orleans?
- Yeah. So what?
- So what?
- What parish?
- Chalmette.
- I love New Orleans.
- You know where Chalmette?
- Yeah.
Okay, cool.
You want a drink or something?
No. I'm not...
I'm not thirsty either.
I just want to stand here.
What's your name? Tommy, right?
Yeah. My name Tommy
with capital go away.
It's okay. Have a nice one.
- Okay?
- Okay.
Okay. Bye.
'Kay.
People are very
strange these day.
Oh, hi, Betty.
My God.
What these friends Greg have.
