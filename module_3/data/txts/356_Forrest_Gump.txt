Hello. My name's
Forrest... Forrest Gump.
Do you want a chocolate?
I could eat about a million
and a half of these.
My mama always said
life was like
a box of chocolates.
You never know what
you're going to get.
Those must be
comfortable shoes.
I bet you could walk all day
in shoes like that
and not feel a thing.
I wish I had shoes like that.
My feet hurt.
Mama always said
there's an awful lot
you can tell about
a person by their shoes.
Where they're going,
where they've been.
I've worn lots of shoes.
I bet if I think
about it real hard
I could remember
my first pair of shoes.
Mama said they'd
take me anywhere.
[Gump]
She said they was my magic shoes.
All right, Forrest,
open your eyes now.
Leùs take a little walk around.
How do those feel?
His legs are strong,
Mrs. Gump,
as strong as I've ever seen.
But his back's as
crooked as a politician.
But we're going to straighten him
right up, aren't we, Forrest?
Forrest!
Now, when I was a baby,
Mama named me after
the great Civil War hero
General Nathan Bedford Forrest.
General Nathan Bedford Forrest.
She said we was related
to him in some way.
What he did was,
he started up this club
called the Ku Klux Klan.
They'd all dress up in their robes
and their bedsheets
and act like a bunch
of ghosts or spooks or something.
They'd even put bedsheets
on their horses and ride around.
And, anyway, thaùs how
I got my name... Forrest Gump.
Mama said the Forrest part
was to remind me
that sometimes we all
do things that, well,
that just don't make no sense.
This way. Hold on. Ugh!
All right.
What are y'all staring at?
Haven't you ever seen
a little boy with braces
on his legs before?
Don't ever let anybody
tell you they're better
than you, Forrest.
If God intended everybody
to be the same,
he'd have given us all
braces on our legs.
Mama always had a way of explaining
things so I could understand them.
We lived about a quarter mile
off Route 17,
about a half mile from the town
of Greenbow, Alabama.
Thaùs in the county
of Greenbow.
Our house had been
in Mama's family
since her grandpa's
grandpa's grandpa
had come across the ocean
about a thousand years ago.
Since it wasjust me and Mama
and we had all these empty rooms,
Mama decided to let those rooms out,
mostly to people passing through,
like from, oh, Mobile,
Montgomery, places like that.
Thaùs how me and Mama got money.
Mama was a real smart lady.
Remember what I told you, Forrest.
You're no different
than anybody else is.
Did you hear
what I said, Forrest?
You're the same
as everybody else.
You are no different.
Your boy's... different,
Mrs. Gump.
His I.Q. Is 75.
Well, we're all different,
Mr. Hancock.
She wanted me to have
the finest education
so she took me to
the Greenbow County Central School.
I met the principal and all.
I want to show you something,
Mrs. Gump.
Now, this is normal.
Forrest is right here.
The state requires
a minimum I.Q. Of 80
to attend public school.
Mrs. Gump,
he's going to have to
go to a special school.
Now, he'll be just fine.
What does normal mean anyway?
He might be...
a bit on the slow side,
but my boy Forrest
is going to get the same
opportunities as everyone else.
He's not going to
some special school
to learn how to retread tires.
We're talking about
five little points here.
There must be something
can be done.
We're a progressive
school system.
We don't want to see
anybody left behind.
Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?
He's on vacation.
Eee! Eee! Eee!
Eee! Eee! Eee!
Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee!
Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee!
Well, your mama sure does care
about your schooling, son.
Mmm-mmm-mmm.
You don't say much, do you?
Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee!
Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee!
Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee! Eee!
"Finally, he had to try.
"It looked easy, but...
oh, what happened.
First they..."
Mama, whaùs vacation mean?
Vacation?
Where Daddy went?
Vacation's when
you go somewhere...
and you don't ever come back.
Anyway, I guess you could say
me and Mama was on our own.
But we didn't mind.
Our house was never empty.
There was always folks
coming and going.
Supper!
Lùs supper, everyone!
That sure looks special.
Sometimes, we had
so many people staying with us
that every room was filled,
with travelers, you know,
folks living
out of their suitcases
and hat cases
and sample cases.
Forrest Gump,
iùs suppertime! Forrest?
One time, a young man
was staying with us,
and he had him a guitar case.
[Guitar Plays]
# Well, you ain't
never caught a rabbit #
#And you ain't no #
# Friend of mine ##
Forrest,
I told you not to bother
this nice young man.
No, thaùs all right, ma'am.
I was showing him
a thing or two on the guitar.
All right. Supper's ready
if y'all want to eat.
Yeah, that sounds good.
Thank you, ma'am.
Say, man, show me that crazy
little walk you did there.
Slow it down some.
#You ain't nothing but... #
I liked that guitar.
It sounded good.
I started moving around
to the music,
swinging my hips.
# Cryin' all the time ##
This one night,
me and Mama was out shopping,
and we walked by Vincy's
Furniture and Appliance Store,
and guess what?
#You ain't nothin'
but a hound dog #
#Cryin'all the time #
#You ain't nothin'
but a hound dog #
This is not for
children's eyes.
#Cryin'all the time #
Some years later,
that handsome young man
who they called the King,
well, he sung too many songs.
Had himself a heart attack
or something.
It must be hard being a king.
You know, iùs funny how you
remember some things,
but some things you can't.
You do your very best now, Forrest.
I sure will, Mama.
I remember the bus ride
on the first day of school
very well.
Are you coming along?
Mama said not to be
taking rides from strangers.
This is the bus to school.
I'm Forrest...
Forrest Gump.
I'm Dorothy Harris.
Well, now we ain't
strangers anymore.
This seaùs taken.
Lùs taken.
You can't sit here.
You know, iùs funny what
a young man recollects,
'cause I don't
remember being born.
I don't recall what I got
for my first Christmas,
and I don't know
when I went on
my first outdoor picnic,
but I do remember
the first time I heard
the sweetest voice
in the wide world.
You can sit here
if you want.
I had never seen anything
so beautiful in my life.
She was like an angel.
Well, are you going to
sit down or aren't you?
Whaùs wrong with your legs?
Um, nothing at all, thank you.
My legs are just fine and dandy.
I just sat next to her
on that bus
and had a conversation
all the way to school.
My back's crooked
like a question mark.
Next to Mama,
no one ever talked to me
or asked me questions.
Are you stupid or something?
Mama says,
"Stupid is as stupid does."
I'm Jenny.
I'm Forrest... Forrest Gump.
From that day on,
we was always together.
Jenny and me
was like peas and carrots.
She taught me how to climb.
Come on, Forrest,
you can do it.
I showed her how to dangle.
"A good little..."
She helped me
learn how to read,
and I showed her how to swing.
Sometimes, we'djust sit out
and wait for the stars.
Mama's going to worry about me.
Just stay a little longer.
For some reason,
Jenny didn't never want to go home.
O.K., Jenny, I'll stay.
She was my most special friend.
My only friend.
Now, my mama always told me
that miracles happen every day.
Some people don't think so,
but they do.
Hey, dummy!
Are you dumb,
or just plain stupid?
Look, I'm Forrest Gimp.
Just run away, Forrest.
Run, Forrest!
Run away! Hurry!
Get the bikes!
Leùs get him! Come on!
Look out, Gump!
We're going to get you!
Run, Forrest, run!
Run, Forrest!
Come back here, you!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Run, Forrest!
Run!
Now, you wouldn't
believe if I told you...
but I could run
like the wind blows.
From that day on,
if I was going somewhere,
I was running.
That boy sure
is a running fool.
Now, remember how I told you
that Jenny never seemed
to want to go home?
She lived in a house
that was as old as Alabama.
Her mama had gone
to heaven when she was 5,
and her daddy was
some kind of a farmer.
Jenny?
He was a very loving man.
He was always kissing
and touching her and her sisters.
And then this one time,
Jenny wasn't on the bus
to go to school.
Jenny, why didn't you
come to school today?
Shh. Daddy's taking a nap.
Jenny!
Come on!
Jenny, where'd you run to?
You better
get back here, girl!
Where you at?
Jenny!
Jenny, where you at?
Jenny!
Pray with me, Forrest.
Pray with me.
Jenny!
Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far,
far, far away from here.
Dear God, make me a bird
so I can fly far.
Mama always said
God is mysterious.
Jenny!
He didn't turn Jenny
into a bird that day.
Instead,
he had the police say
Jenny didn't have to stay
in that house no more.
She was to live
with her grandma,
just over on Creekmore Avenue,
which made me happy,
'cause she was so close.
Some nights,
Jenny'd sneak out
and come on over to my house,
just 'cause
she said she was scared.
Scared of what,
I don't know.
But I think
it was her grandma's dog.
He was a mean dog.
Anyway, Jenny and me
was best friends
all the way up
through high school.
Hey, stupid!
Quit it!
Run, Forrest, run!
Hey,
didn't you hear me, stupid?
Run, Forrest!
Get in the truck!
Come on!
He's getting away! Move it!
Run, Forrest! Run!
Ha, ha!
Move it! Move it!
You better be runnin'!
Yeah!
- Whoo-hoo!
- Go!
Run, Forrest!
Now, it used to be
I ran to get
where I was going.
I never thought
it would take me anywhere.
Ohh!
Who in the hell is that?
That there is Forrest Gump, Coach.
Just a local idiot.
And can you believe it?
I got to go to college, too.
Forrest, move it!
Run!
O. K!
Run!
Run, you stupid
son of a bitch! Run!
Run, son of a bitch, run!
Go! Run!
Run! Run! Go!
[Whistle Blows]
He must be the stupidest
son of a bitch alive,
but he sure is fast.
Now, maybe iùsjust me,
but college was
very confusing times.
Federal troops,
enforcing a court order,
integrated the University
of Alabama today.
Two Negroes were admitted,
but only after
Governor George Wallace
had carried out
his symbolic threat
to stand in the schoolhouse door.
I take it from that statement...
Earl, whaùs going on?
Coons are trying
to get into school.
Coons? When raccoons tried
getting on our back porch,
Mama just chased them off
with a broom.
Not raccoons, you idiot. Niggers.
And they want to go
to school with us.
With us? They do?
[TV Reporter]
Shortly after Governor Wallace
had carried out his promise
to block the doorway,
Kennedy ordered the secretary
of defense to use military force.
Here, by videotape,
is the encounter
by General Graham, commander
of the National Guard,
and Governor Wallace.
Because these National Guardsmen
are here today as
federal soldiers for Alabama,
and they live within our borders.
They are our brothers.
We are winning in this fight,
because we are awakening
the American people
to the dangers that
we have spoken about so many times
that is so evident today...
A trend toward military
dictatorship in this country.
And so, at day's end,
the University of Alabama in
Tuscaloosa had been desegregated,
and studentsJimmy Hood
and Vivian Malone
had been signed up
for summer classes.
Ma'am, you dropped your book.
Ma'am.
[Chet Huntley] Governor Wallace
did what he promised.
By being on the Tuscaloosa campus,
he kept the mob...
Say, wasn't that Gump?
Naw, that couldn't be.
It sure as hell was.
[Gump]
A few years later,
that angry little man
at the schoolhouse door
thought iùd be a good idea
and ran for president.
But somebody thought
that it wasn't.
But he didn't die.
My bus is here.
Is it the number 9?
No, iùs the number 4.
It was nice talking to you.
I remember when that happened,
when Wallace got shot.
I was in college.
Did you go to a girls' college
or a girls' and boys'
together college?
It was coed.
'Cause Jenny went to a college
I couldn't go to.
It was a college
just for girls.
But I'd go and visit her
every chance I got.
#I don't know why I love you #
#But I do #
#I don't know why I cry so #
#But I do #
#I only know I know that... #
Ohh!
That hurts.
#But I don't know why
I love you #
#But I do #
Forrest!
Forrest!
Forrest, stop it!
Stop it!
What are you doing?
He was hurting you.
No, he wasn't!
Get over there!
Billy, I'm sorry.
Just keep away from me.
Don't be such... Don't go.
Billy, wait a second.
He doesn't know any better.
Forrest, why'd you do that?
I brought you some chocolate.
I'm sorry.
I'll go back
to my college now.
Forrest...
Look at you.
Come on.
Come on.
[Thunder]
Is this your own room?
Shh!
Do you ever dream, Forrest...
about who you're going to be?
Who I'm going to be?
Yeah.
Aren't I going to be me?
You'll always be you,
just another kind of you.
You know?
I want to be famous.
I want to be a singer
like Joan Baez.
I just want to be...
on an empty stage
with my guitar, my voice.
Just me.
And I want to reach people
on a personal level.
I want to be able
to say things,
just one to one.
Have you ever been
with a girl, Forrest?
I sit next to them
in my home economics class
all the time.
Oh...
Oh...
Oh, I'm sorry.
Lùs O.K.
Sorry.
Oh...
Oh...
lùs all right.
Lùs O.K.
Oh, I'm dizzy.
I'll bet that never
happened in home ec.
No.
I think I ruined
your roommate's bathrobe.
I don't care.
I don't like her anyway.
Run! Run! Run! Run!
Run! Run! Run! Run!
Run! Run! Run! Run!
Run! Run!
Run! Run! Run! Run!
Stop! Stop! Stop!
College ran by real fast
'cause I played
so much football.
They even put me on a thing
called the all-America team
where you get to meet
the president of the United States.
President Kennedy met
with the collegiate
all-American football team
at the Oval Office today.
Now the really good thing
about meeting the president
of the United States
is the food.
They put you in this little room
with just about anything
you'd want to eat or drink.
But since, number one,
I wasn't hungry but thirsty,
and number two, they was free,
I must have drank me
about 15 Dr. Peppers.
[Burp]
How does it feel
to be an all-American?
Lùs an honor, sir.
How does it feel
to be an all-American?
Very good, sir.
How does it feel
to be an all-American?
Very good, sir.
Congratulations.
How do you feel?
I got to pee.
I believe he said
he had to pee.
Some time later,
for no particular reason,
somebody shot
that nice young president
when he was riding
in his car.
And a few years after that,
somebody shot
his little brother, too,
only he was
in a hotel kitchen.
Must be hard being brothers.
I wouldn't know.
Forrest Gump.
Now can you believe it?
After only five years
of playing football,
I got a college degree.
Congratulations, son.
Mama was so proud.
Forrest, I'm so proud of you.
I'll hold this for you.
Congratulations, son.
Have you given any thought
to your future?
Thought?
Hello. I'm Forrest.
Forrest Gump.
Nobody gives a horse's shit
who you are, pus ball!
You're not even a lowlife,
scum-sucking maggot!
Get your maggoty ass
on the bus!
You're in the army now!
Seaùs taken.
Taken.
At first it seemed
like I made a mistake.
It was only
my induction day,
and I was getting yelled at.
Sit down if you want to.
I didn't know who I might meet
or what they might ask.
You ever been
on a real shrimp boat?
No.
But I been on a real big boat.
I'm talking about
a shrimp catching boat.
I been working on
shrimp boats all my life.
I started out
on my uncle's boat
when I was about maybe 9.
I was just looking
into buying my own boat
and got drafted.
My given name
is Benjamin Buford Blue.
People call me Bubba,
just like one of them
old redneck boys.
Can you believe that?
My name's Forrest Gump.
People call me Forrest Gump.
So Bubba was from
Bayou La Batre, Alabama,
and his mama cooked shrimp.
And her mama
before her cooked shrimp,
and her mama before her mama
cooked shrimp, too.
Bubba's family knew everything
there was to know about
the shrimping business.
I know everything
there is to know
about the shrimping business.
I'm going into
the shrimping business for myself
after I get out of the army.
O.K.
Gump!
Whaùs your sole purpose
in this army?
To do whatever you tell me,
Drill Sergeant!
God damn it, Gump,
you're a goddamn genius.
Thaùs the most outstanding
answer I've ever heard.
You must have
a goddamn I.Q. Of 160.
You are goddamn gifted,
Private Gump.
Listen up, people!
Now for some reason,
I fit in the army
like one of them round pegs.
Lùs not really hard.
You just make your bed neat,
remember to stand up straight,
and always answer every question
with "Yes, Drill Sergeant."
Is that clear?
Yes, Drill Sergeant!
What you do is drag your nets
along the bottom.
On a good day,
you can catch over
a hundred pounds of shrimp.
Everything goes all right,
2 men shrimping 10 hours,
less what you spends on gas...
Done, Drill Sergeant!
Gump!
Why did you put that weapon
together so quickly?
You told me to,
Drill Sergeant.
Jesus H. Christ.
This is a new company record.
If it wasn't a waste
of a fine enlisted man,
I'd recommend you for O.C.S.,
Private Gump.
You're going to be
a general someday!
Now disassemble your weapon
and continue!
Anyway, like I was saying,
shrimp is the fruit
of the sea.
You can barbecue it,
boil it, broil it,
bake it, sautÈ it.
They's, uh, shrimp kabobs,
shrimp creole,
shrimp gumbo,
pan fried, deep fried,
stir fried.
There's pineapple shrimp
and lemon shrimp,
coconut shrimp,
pepper shrimp,
shrimp soup, shrimp stew,
shrimp salad,
shrimp in potatoes,
shrimp burger,
shrimp sandwich.
That... Thaùs about it.
Nighttime in the army
is a lonely time.
We'd lay there in our bunks,
and I'd miss my mama,
and I'd missJenny.
Hey, Gump.
Get a load of the tits on her.
Turns out...
Jenny had gotten
into some trouble
over some photos of her
in her college sweater.
And she was
thrown out of school.
# My baby does the hanky panky #
But that wasn't a bad thing,
'cause a man who owns a theater
in Memphis, Tennessee,
saw those photos
and offered Jenny
a job singing in a show.
The first chance I got,
I took the bus up to Memphis
to see her perform in that show.
That was Amber, Amber Flame.
Give her a big hand.
And now, for your listening
and viewing pleasure,
direct from Hollywood,
California,
our very own beatnik beauty.
Leùs give a big round of applause
to the luscious Bobbie Dylan.
# How many roads
must a man walk down #
# Before you can
call him a man? #
#Yes, and how many seas
must the white dove sail #
Her dream had come true.
# Before she sleeps
in the sand? #
She was a folksinger.
#Yes, and how many times #
# Must the cannonballs fly #
# Before they're
forever banned? #
Shake it up now.
Somebody get her a harmonica.
#The answer, my friend #
# Is blowin' in the wind ##
This ain't Captain Kangaroo.
Hey, honey, I got
something here for you.
Hey! God damn it!
Hey, you stupid jerk!
I'm singing a song here.
Polly, get out here!
Shut up yourself!
Just shut up!
Forrest! What are you
doing here?
What are you doing?
- Hey!
- Aw!
What are you doing, Forrest?
Let me down!
- Oh! Ooh!
- Ooh!
Ha ha ha!
You can't keep
doing this, Forrest.
You can't keep
trying to rescue me.
They was trying to grab you.
A lot of people try to grab me.
Just... You can't keep
doing this all the time.
I can't help it.
I love you.
Forrest...
You don't know what love is.
You remember that time
we prayed, Forrest?
We prayed for God
to turn me into a bird
so I could fly far away.
Yes, I do.
You think I could
fly off this bridge?
What do you mean, Jenny?
Nothing.
I got to get out of here.
Wait, Jenny.
Forrest, you stay
away from me, O. K?
You stay away from me, please.
Can I have a ride?
Where are you going?
I don't care.
Get in the truck.
So bye-bye, Jenny.
They sending me to Vietnam.
Lùs this whole other country.
Just hang on a minute.
Listen, you promise me
something, O. K?
Just if you're
ever in trouble,
don't be brave.
You just run, O. K?
Just run away.
O.K.
Jenny.
I'll write you all the time.
Andjust like that,
she was gone.
Andjust like that,
she was gone.
You come back safe to me.
Do you hear?
# Some folks are born #
# Made to wave the flag #
# Ooh, they're red,
white, and blue #
#And when the band plays
"Hail To The Chief" #
# Ooh, they'll point
the cannon at you #
# It ain't me #
# It ain't me #
# I ain't no senator's son #
# It ain't me ##
Now they told us
that Vietnam was going
to be very different
from the United States
of America.
Except for all
the beer cans and barbecues,
it was.
Hey, I'll bet there's shrimp
all in these waters.
They tell me these Vietnams
is good shrimp.
After we win this war
and we take over everything,
we can get American
shrimpers out here
and shrimp these waters.
Just shrimp all the time, man.
You must be my FNGs.
Morning, sir.
Oh, get your hands down.
Do not salute me.
There are goddamn snipers
all around this area
who'd love
to grease an officer.
I'm Lieutenant Dan Taylor.
Welcome to Fort Platoon.
Whaùs wrong with your lip?
I was born with big gums, sir.
Well, you better tuck that in.
Gonna get that caught
on a trip wire.
Where are you boys
from in the world?
- Alabama, sir!
- Alabama, sir!
You twins?
No. We are not relations, sir.
Look,
iùs pretty basic here.
You stick with me
and learn from the guys
who've been in country a while,
you'll be all right.
There is one item of G.I. Gear
that can be the difference
between life and death...
Socks.
Cushioned sole, O.D. Green.
Try and keep your feet dry.
When we're out humpin',
change your socks
whenever we stop.
The Mekong will eat
a grunùs feet
right off his legs.
Sergeant Sims. God damn it,
where's that sling rope
I said to order?
I put in the requisitions.
Well, you call
those sons of bitches...
Lieutenant Dan
sure knew his stuff.
I felt real lucky
he was my lieutenant.
He was from a long,
great military tradition.
Somebody in his family
had fought
and died
in every...
single...
American war.
God damn it, kick some ass.
Get on it!
I guess you could say
he had a lot to live up to.
So, you boys
from Arkansas, huh?
Well,
I been through there.
Little Rock's a fine town.
Now, shake down your gear.
See the platoon sergeant.
Draw what you need
for the field.
If you boys are hungry,
we got steaks burning
right over here.
Two standing orders
in this platoon...
1... take care of your feet,
2... try not to do
anything stupid,
like getting
yourself killed.
I sure hope I don't
let him down.
I got to see
a lot of the countryside.
We would take
these real long walks.
#There must be
some kind of way #
# Out of here #
# Said the joker
to the thief #
And we were always lookin'
for this guy named Charlie.
#There's too much confusion #
# I can't get no relief ##
Hold it up!
Hold up, boys!
It wasn't always fun.
Lieutenant Dan was always
getting these funny feelings
about a rock or a trail
or the road,
so he'd tell us
to get down, shut up.
Get down!
Shut up!
So we did.
Now I don't know
much about anything,
but I think some of
America's best young men
served in this war.
There was Dallas from Phoenix.
Cleveland...
he was from Detroit.
Hey, Tex.
Hey, Tex.
What the hell's going on?
And Tex was...
Well, I don't remember
where Tex come from...
Ah, nothing.
Fourth platoon, on your feet.
Y'all got 10 clicks
to go to that river.
Move out.
1, 2! Hup!
Step it up!
Look alive out there.
The good thing about Vietnam
is there was always
someplace to go.
Fire in the hole!
Gump, check out that hole.
And there was always
something to do.
Mount 'em up!
Spread out!
Cover his back!
One day it started raining,
and it didn't quit for four months.
We've been through
every kind of rain there is...
little bitty stinging rain
and big old fat rain,
rain that flew in sideways,
and sometimes rain even seemed
to come straight up
from underneath.
Shoot, it even rained at night.
Hey, Forrest.
Hey, Bubba.
I'm going to lean up against you.
You lean up against me.
This way we don't have to sleep
with our heads in the mud.
You know why we're
a good partnership, Forrest?
'Cause we be watching out
for one another,
like brothers and stuff.
Hey, Forrest,
something I been thinking about.
I got a very important
question to ask you.
How would you like to go
into the shrimping
business with me?
O.K.
Man, I tell you what.
I got it all figured out, too.
So many pounds of shrimp
will pay off the boat.
So many pounds for gas.
We'll live right on the boat.
We ain't got to pay no rent.
We can just work it together,
split everything right
down the middle.
Man, I'm telling you, 50-50.
Hey, Forrest,
all the shrimp you can eat.
Thaùs a fine idea.
Bubba did have a fine idea.
I even wroteJenny
and told her all about it.
I sent her letters...
Not every day, but almost.
I told her what I was doing
and asked her what she was doing
and told her how
I thought about her always.
And how I was looking forward
to getting a letter from her
just as soon
as she had the time.
I'd always let her know
that I was O.K.
Then I'd sign each letter
"Love, Forrest Gump."
#There's somethin'
happenin' here #
This one day, we was out
walking like always,
and then, just like that,
somebody turned off the rain,
and the sun come out.
# I got to beware ##
Ambush!
Take cover!
Get that pig up here,
god damn it!
Forrest! You okay?
Strong-arm, Strong-arm!
Hey! We got a man down!
Strong-arm,
this is Leg Lima 6! Over!
Roger, Strong-arm!
Be advised we have incoming
from the treeline at point blue
plus two!
A.K. S and rockets!
We're getting it hard!
Misfire! Misfire!
God damn it!
Get that pig unfucked
and on the treeline!
They got us,
and it hurt.
We're going to move
back to the blue line.
Pull back! Pull back!
Forrest! Run, Forrest!
Pull back!
Run! Run, man!
Run!
Pull back, Gump!
Run, God damn it! Run!
I ran and ran
just likeJenny told me to.
I ran so far so fast
that pretty soon
I was all by myself,
which was a bad thing.
Bubba.
Bubba was my best good friend.
I had to make sure he was O.K.
Where the hell are you?
Bubba!
And on my way
back to find Bubba,
well, there was this boy
laying on the ground.
Tex.
O.K.
I couldn't let him
lay there all alone,
scared the way he was,
so I grabbed him up
and run him out of there.
Every time I went back
looking for Bubba,
somebody else was saying,
"Help me, Forrest, help me!"
O.K. Here. Here.
No sweat, man.
Lay back. You'll be O.K.
I started to get scared
that I might never find Bubba.
I know my position
is danger close!
We got Charlie
all over this area.
I got to have those fast movers
in here now. Over.
Lieutenant Dan,
Coleman's dead!
I know he's dead!
My whole goddamn platoon
is wiped out!
God damn it!
What are you doing?
You leave me here!
Get away.
Just leave me here!
Get out!
Aah! God, I said
leave me here, God damn it!
Leg Lima, this is Strong-arm.
Be advised your fast movers
are inbound. Over.
Then it felt like something
just jumped up and bit me.
Aah! Something bit me!
Aah! Aah!
You son of a bitch!
Aah!
I can't leave the platoon.
I told you
to leave me there, Gump.
Forget about me.
Get yourself out!
Did you hear what I said?
Gump, damn it, put me down.
Get your ass out of here.
I didn't ask you to pull me out
of there, God damn you!
Where the hell
do you think you're going?
To get Bubba.
I got an air strike
inbound right now.
They're going to nape
the whole area.
Stay here!
Thaùs an order.
I gotta find Bubba!
Forrest.
Bubba.
I'm O.K., Forrest.
I'm O.K.
O-Oh, Bubba, no.
I'll be all right.
[Voices Speaking In Vietnamese]
Come on.
Come on. Come on.
Ugh. I'm O.K., Forrest.
[Airplanes Approach]
I'm O.K. I'm fine.
[Lieutenant Dan]
Top smoke. Get it up there.
If I'd have known
this was going to be
the last time
me and Bubba was gonna talk,
I'd of thought of
something better to say.
Hey, Bubba.
Hey, Forrest.
Forrest...
Why did this happen?
You got shot.
Then Bubba said something
I won't ever forget.
I want to go home.
Bubba was my best good friend.
And even I know
that ain't something you can
findjust around the corner.
Bubba was going to be
a shrimping boat captain,
but instead, he died right there
by that river in Vietnam.
Thaùs all I have
to say about that.
It was a bullet, wasn't it?
A bullet?
That jumped up and bit you.
Oh. Yes, sir.
Bit me directly
in the but-tocks.
They said it was a million
dollar wound, but...
the army must keep that money,
'cause I still ain't seen a nickel
of that million dollars.
The only good thing about being
wounded in the but-tocks
is the ice cream.
They gave me all
the ice cream I could eat.
And guess what?
A good friend of mine was
in the bed right next door.
Lieutenant Dan,
I got you some ice cream.
Lieutenant Dan, ice cream!
Lùs time for
your bath, Lieutenant.
Harper!
[Man]
Cooper.
Larson.
Webster.
Gump.
Gump!
I'm Forrest Gump.
Kyle.
Nichols.
McMill.
Johnson.
Surprise, surprise, surprise!
Gump, how can you
watch that stupid shit?
Turn it off.
You are tuned
to the American forces
Vietnam network.
This is channel 6, Saigon.
Good catch, Gump.
You know how to play this?
Come on. Let me show you.
Now, the secret to this game is
no matter what happens,
never, ever...
take your eye off the ball.
All right.
For some reason,
Ping-Pong came very natural to me.
See?
Any idiot can play.
So I started playing it
all the time.
I played Ping-Pong
even when I didn't have anyone
to play Ping-Pong with.
The hospital's people
said it made me look
like a duck in water...
Whatever that means.
Even Lieutenant Dan
would come and watch me play.
I played Ping-Pong so much,
I even played it in my sleep.
Now...
you listen to me.
We all have a destiny.
Nothing just happens.
Lùs all part of a plan!
I should have died
out there with my men,
but now... I'm nothing
but a goddamn cripple,
a legless freak!
Look. Look! Look at me!
You see that?
Do you know what iùs like
not to be able to use your legs?
Y-Y-Yes, sir, I do.
Did you hear what I said?
You cheated me!
I had a destiny.
I was supposed
to die in the field
with honor!
That was my destiny,
and you...
cheated me out of it!
You understand
what I'm saying, Gump?
This wasn't supposed
to happen...
Not to me.
I had a destiny.
I was...
Lieutenant...
Dan Taylor.
Y-You still
Lieutenant Dan.
Look at me.
What am I going to do now?
What am I going to do now?
PFC Gump?
Yes, sir!
As you were.
Son,
you been awarded
the Medal of Honor.
Guess what, Lieutenant Dan?
They want to give me a med...
Ma'am.
What did they do
with Lieutenant Dan?
They sent him home.
Two weeks later,
I left Vietnam.
The ceremony was kicked off
with a candid speech
by the president
regarding the need for further
escalation of the war in Vietnam.
Johnson awarded 4 Medals of Honor to
men from each of the armed services.
America owes you
a debt of gratitude, son.
I understand you were wounded.
Where were you hit?
In the but-tocks, sir.
Well, that must be a sight.
I'd kinda like to see that.
#And here's to you,
Mrs. Robinson #
#Jesus loves you more
than you will know #
# Whoa, whoa, whoa #
# God bless you, please,
Mrs. Robinson ##
God damn, son!
After that, Mama went
to the hotel to lay down,
so I went out for a walk
to see our nation's capital.
Hilary! I got the vets.
What do you want
to do with them?
Lùs a good thing
Mama was resting,
'cause the streets
was awful crowded with people
lookin'at all the statues
and monuments,
and some of them people
were loud and pushy.
O.K., follow me!
Everywhere I went,
I had to stand in line.
Come on.
Go!
Hey, you're a good man
for doing this.
Good.
O.K.
There was this man
giving a little talk.
And for some reason,
he was wearing
an American flag for a shirt.
And he liked to say
the "F"word... a lot.
"F"this and "F"that.
And every time
he said the "F"word,
people, for some reason,
well, they cheered.
[Feedback]
Yeah! Yeah!
Come on, man.
Come up here, man.
Come on. Come on.
Yeah, you!
Come on. Move, move!
Go on. Leùs get up there.
Tell us a little bit
about the war, man.
The war in Vietnam?
The war in Viet-
fucking-nam!
Well...
There was only one thing
I could say
about the war in Vietnam.
There's only one thing
I can say about...
the war in Vietnam.
In Vietnam...
[Feedback]
[Silence]
What the hell are you do...
I'll beat your head in,
you goddamn oinker!
Jesus Christ!
What did they do with this?
Can't hear you!
Can't hear anything!
This... This one!
Give me that!
Speak up!
Thaùs it.
And thaùs all I have to say
about that.
Thaùs so right on, man.
You said it all.
Whaùs your name, man?
My name is Forrest.
Forrest Gump.
Forrest Gump.
- Gump! Gump!
- Gump!
Forrest!
Forrest!
Jenny!
Forrest!
Hey!
It was the happiest
moment of my life.
Jenny and me werejust like
peas and carrots again.
She showed me around
and even introduced me
to some of her new friends.
Shut that blind, man!
And get your white ass
away from that window.
Don't you know we in a war here?
Don't you know we in a war here?
He's cool.
He's one of us.
Let me tell you about us.
Our purpose here is
to protect our black leaders
from the racial
onslaught of the pig
who wishes to brutalize
our black leaders,
rape our women, and destroy
our black communities.
Who's the baby killer?
This is my good friend
I told you about.
This is Forrest Gump.
Forrest, this is Wesley.
Wesley and I
lived together in Berkeley,
and he's the president
of the Berkeley chapter of SDS.
We are here to offer
protection and help
for all those
who need our help,
because we,
the Black Panthers,
are against the war in Vietnam.
We are against any war
where black soldiers
are sent to the front line
to die for a country
that hates them.
We are against any war
where black soldiers go to fight
and come to be brutalized and
killed in their own communities.
We are against
these racist and imperial acts...
#And I gave her the gun #
# I shot her ##
Forrest!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Forrest!
Stop it! Stop it!
I shouldn't have
brought you here.
I should have known it was going
to be some bullshit hassle!
He should not be
hitting you, Jenny.
Come on, Forrest.
Sorry I had a fight in the middle
of your Black Panther party.
He doesn't mean it
when he does things like this.
I would never hurt you, Jenny.
I know you wouldn't,
Forrest.
I wanted to be your boyfriend.
That uniform is a trip, Forrest.
You look handsome in it.
You do.
You know what?
What?
I'm glad we were here together
in our nation's capital.
Me, too, Forrest.
We walked around
all night, Jenny and me,
just talkin'.
She told me about
all the traveling she'd done
and how she discovered
ways to expand her mind
and learn how
to live in harmony...
which must be
out west somewhere,
'cause she made it
all the way to California.
# Love one another right now ##
Hey.
Anybody want to go
to San Francisco?
I'll go.
Far out!
It was a very special night
for the two of us.
I didn't want it to end.
Wish you wouldn't go, Jenny.
I have to, Forrest.
Jenny?
Things got
a little out of hand.
Lùs just this war
and that lying
son of a bitch Johnson and...
I would never hurt you.
You know that.
Know what I think?
I think...
you should go home to Greenbow,
Alabama!
Forrest,
we have very
different lives, you know.
I want you...
to have this.
Forrest, I can't keep this.
I got it...
just by doing
what you told me to do.
Why are you so good to me?
You're my girl.
I'll always be your girl.
#To everything,
turn, turn, turn #
#There is a season,
turn, turn, turn #
#And a time to every purpose #
# Under heaven ##
Andjust like that,
she was gone
out of my life again.
Thaùs one small step for man,
one giant leap for mankind.
I thought I was
going back to Vietnam,
but instead they decided
the best way for me
to fight the Communists
was to play Ping-Pong,
so I was in the Special Services,
traveling around the country,
cheering up wounded veterans
and showing 'em
how to play Ping-Pong.
I was so good
that some years later,
the army decided I should be
on the all-American Ping-Pong team.
We were the first Americans
to visit the land of China
in a million years or something.
Somebody said world peace
was in our hands,
but all I did was play Ping-Pong.
When I got home,
I was a national celebrity,
famouser even
than Captain Kangaroo.
Here he is, Forrest Gump.
Right here.
Gump, have a seat.
Forrest Gump, John Lennon.
Welcome home.
Can you tell us, um,
what was China like?
In the land of China...
people hardly got nothin'at all.
No possessions?
And in China,
they never go to church.
No religion, too?
Oh.
Hard to imagine.
Well, iùs easy if you try, Dick.
Some years later,
that nice young man from England
was on his way home
to see his little boy
and was signing some autographs.
For no particular reason at all,
somebody shot him.
They gave you...
the congressional Medal of Honor.
Now, thaùs Lieutenant Dan.
Lieutenant Dan!
They gave you...
the congressional
Medal of Honor.
Yes, sir.
They surely did.
They gave you,
an imbecile,
a moron who goes on television
and makes a fool out of himself
in front of
the whole damn country,
the Congressional
Medal of Honor.
Yes, sir.
Well... that...
thaùs just perfect!
Yeah, well, I just got
one thing to say to that...
Goddamn bless America.
Hey, hey!
Whoa...
Oh, God, whoa!
Ow! Oh! Oh, God!
Lieutenant Dan!
Lieutenant Dan said
he was living in a hotel
and because he didn't
have no legs,
he spent most of his time
exercising his arms.
Make a right. Take a right!
Hey!
Ah, ah!
What do you do here
in New York, Lieutenant Dan?
I'm living off
the government tit.
[Honk]
Hey, hey, hey, are you blind?
I'm walking here!
Ah, get out!
Come on. Go, go, go!
[Singing Silent Night]
I stayed with Lieutenant Dan
and celebrated the holidays.
You have a great year,
and hurry home.
God bless you.
Have you found
Jesus yet, Gump?
I didn't know I was supposed
to be looking for Him, sir.
Thaùs all these cripples
down at the V. A...
Thaùs all they ever
talk about.
Jesus this
and Jesus that. Ha.
Have I... found Jesus?
They even had a priest
come and talk to me.
He said God is listening,
but I have to help myself.
Now, if I accept Jesus
into my heart,
I'll get to walk beside Him
in the kingdom of heaven.
Did you hear what I said?
Walk...
beside Him
in the kingdom of heaven.
Well... kiss my crippled ass.
God is listening?
What a crock of shit.
I'm going to heaven,
Lieutenant Dan.
Oh?
Well...
before you go...
why don't you
get your ass
down to the corner
and get us more Ripple?
Yes, sir.
We're at approximately
45th Street in New York City
at One Astor Plaza.
This is the site of the old...
What the hell is
in Bayou La Batre?
Shrimping boats.
Shrimping boats? Who gives
a shit about shrimping boats?
I got to buy me one
soon as I have some money.
I promised Bubba in Vietnam
that as soon as the war
was over, we'd be partners.
He'd be the captain
and I'd be his first mate.
But now that he's dead,
I got to be the captain.
A shrimp boat captain.
Yes, sir. A promise
is a promise, Lieutenant Dan.
Now hear this!
Private Gump here
is gonna be
a shrimp boat captain.
Well, I tell you what, Gilligan.
The day that you are
a shrimp boat captain,
I will come and be
your first mate.
Ha ha ha!
If you're ever
a shrimp boat captain,
thaùs the day
I'm an astronaut!
Danny, what are you
complaining about?
Danny, how you doing, huh?
Mr. Hot Wheels!
Who's your friend?
My name is Forrest.
Forrest Gump.
This is cunning Carla
and long-limbs Lenore.
So where you been,
babycakes, huh?
Haven't seen you
around lately.
You should have been here
for Christmas,
'cause Tommy bought a free round
and gave everybody
a turkey sandwich.
Well, well,
I had, uh... company.
Hey! Hey, we was just there!
Thaùs like Times Square.
Don't you just love New Year's?
You can start all over.
Everybody gets a second chance.
Lùs funny...
but in the middle
of all that fun,
I began to think about Jenny,
wondering how she was
spending her New Year's night
out in California.
# Don't you love her ways? #
#Tell me what you say #
# Don't you love her madly? #
# Want to meet her daddy? #
# Don't you love her face? #
# Don't you love her
as she's walkin' out the door? ##
9... 8...
7... 6...
5... 4...
3... 2...
1!
[Crowd]
Happy new year!
[Toot]
# Should auld acquaintance
be forgot #
#And never brought to mind #
Happy new year, Lieutenant Dan!
# Should auld acquaintance
be forgot #
# In days of auld lang syne ##
#Together we stand #
# Divided we fall #
# Come on now, people, leùs #
# Get on the ball #
#And work together #
# Come on, come on #
# Leùs work together ##
Oh! What are you,
stupid or something?
Whaùs your problem?
Whaùs his problem?
Did you lose your packet
in the war or something?
Is your friend
stupid or something?
What did you say?
I said is your friend
stupid or something?
Don't call him stupid!
Hey, don't push her!
You shut up!
Don't you ever call him stupid!
Come on, baby,
why you being so upset, huh?
Get your goddamned clothes
and get the hell out of here!
You should be in a sideshow.
You're so pathetic!
Get out of here!
You big guy!
Loser. You freak!
Oh, no. No.
I'm sorry I ruined
your New Year's Eve party,
Lieutenant Dan.
She tastes like cigarettes.
I guess Lieutenant Dan figured
there's some things
you just can't change.
He didn't want
to be called crippled
just like I didn't
want to be called stupid.
Happy new year, Gump.
The U.S. Ping-Pong team
met with President Nixon today...
Wouldn't you know it?
A few months later,
they invited me
and the Ping-Pong team
to visit the White House.
So I went...
again.
And I met the president
of the United States again.
Only this time,
they didn't get us rooms
in a real fancy hotel.
Are you enjoying yourself
in our nation's capital,
young man?
Where are you staying?
Lùs called the Hotel Ebbott.
Oh, no, no, no.
I know a much nicer hotel.
Lùs brand-new. Very modern.
I'll have my people
take care of it.
Security.
Yeah. Sir,
you might want to send
a maintenance man
over to that office
across the way.
The lights are off
and they must be looking
for a fuse box,
'cause them flashlights,
they're keeping me awake.
O.K., sir.
I'll check it out.
Thank you. Good night.
Therefore...
I shall resign the presidency
effective at noon tomorrow.
Vice President Ford
will be sworn in as president
at that hour in this office.
Forrest Gump.
Yes, sir!
As you were.
I have your discharge papers.
Service is up, son.
Does this mean I can't
play Ping-Pong no more?
For the army, it does.
Andjust like that,
my service in
the United States Army was over.
So I went home.
I'm home, Mama.
I know. I know.
Louise, he's here.
Now, when I got home,
I had no idea,
but Mama had all sorts
of visitors.
We've had all sorts of visitors.
Everybody wants you
to use their Ping-Pong stuff.
One man even left
a check for $25,000
if you'd be agreeable to saying
you like using their paddle.
I only like using
my own paddle.
Hi, Miss Louise.
Hey, Forrest.
I know that,
but iùs $25,000, Forrest.
I thought maybe
you could hold it for a while,
see if it grows on you.
That Mama, she sure was right.
Lùs funny how things work out.
I didn't stay home for long
because I'd made
a promise to Bubba,
and I always try
to keep my promise,
so I went on down
to Bayou La Batre
to meet Bubba's family.
Are you crazy
or just plain stupid?
Stupid is as stupid does,
Mrs. Blue.
I guess.
And, of course,
I paid my respect
to Bubba himself.
Hey, Bubba.
Lùs me, Forrest Gump.
I remember everything
you said,
and I got it
all figured out.
I'm taking $24,562.47
that I got, thaùs left
after a new haircut
and a new suit
and took Mama out
to a real fancy dinner,
and I bought a bus ticket,
then three Dr. Peppers.
Tell me something.
Are you stupid or something?
Stupid is as stupid does, sir.
Thaùs whaùs left
after me saying,
"When I was in China on
the all-America Ping-Pong team,
"I just loved
playing Ping-Pong
with my Flex-O-Lite
Ping-Pong paddle,"
which everybody knows isn't true,
but Mama said it was just
a little white lie,
so it wasn't hurting nobody.
So anyway,
I'm putting all that
on gas, ropes, and new nets
and a brand-new shrimping boat.
Now Bubba told me everything
he knew about shrimping,
but you know what I found out?
Shrimping is tough.
I only caught five.
A couple more,
you can have yourself a cocktail.
Hey, you ever think about
naming this old boat?
Lùs bad luck to have
a boat without a name.
I'd never named a boat before,
but there was only one
I could think of,
the most beautiful name
in the wide world.
#Do a little dance #
#Make a little love #
#Get down tonight #
#Get down tonight #
#Do a little dance #
#Make a little love #
#Get down tonight #
#Whoo #
#Get down tonight... ##
Now, I hadn't heard from Jenny
in a long while,
but I thought about her a lot.
I hoped whatever
she was doing made her happy.
# Oh, and the bird
you cannot change #
#And this bird
you cannot change #
# Lord knows I can't change #
# Lord, help me, I can't change ##
I thought about Jenny all the time.
Hey!
Lieutenant Dan,
what are you doing here?
Well, thought
I'd try out my sea legs.
Well, you ain't got no legs,
Lieutenant Dan.
Yes, I know that.
You wrote me a letter,
you idiot.
Well, well.
Captain Forrest Gump.
I had to see this for myself...
and...
I told you if you were ever
a shrimp boat captain,
that I'd be your first mate.
Well, here I am.
I'm a man of my word.
O.K.
But don't you be thinking
that I'm going
to be calling you "sir."
No, sir.
Lùs my boat.
I have a feeling
if we head due east,
we'll find some shrimp,
so take a left.
Take a left!
Which way?
Over there!
They're over there!
Get on the wheel
and take a left.
O.K.
Gump, what are you doing?
Take a left!
Left!
Thaùs where we're going
to find those shrimp, my boy!
Ha ha!
Thaùs where we'll find them.
Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan.
O.K., so I was wrong.
Well, how are we
going to find them?
Maybe you should
just pray for shrimp.
# So pray that #
# I'm homeward bound... ##
So I went to church every Sunday.
Sometimes Lieutenant Dan came, too,
though I think he left
the praying up to me.
No shrimp.
Where the hell's
this God of yours?
Lùs funny Lieutenant Dan said that
'cause right then God showed up.
[Dan]
You'll never sink this boat!
Now, me, I was scared,
but Lieutenant Dan, he was mad.
Come on!
You call this a storm?
Come on, you son of a bitch!
Lùs time for a showdown!
You and me!
I'm right here!
Come and get me!
Ha ha! Ha ha!
You'll never sink...
this...
boat!
Ha ha ha ha!
Hurricane Carmen
came through here yesterday,
destroying nearly
everything in its path.
And as in other towns
up and down the coast,
Bayou La Batre's
entire shrimping industry
has fallen victim to Carmen
and has been left in utter ruin.
This reporter has learned,
in fact, only one shrimping boat
actually survived the storm.
Louise. Louise, there's Forrest.
[Gump]
After that, shrimping was easy.
#There will be great bounty #
# Oh, my God... ##
Since people still
needed them shrimps
for shrimp cocktails
and barbecues and all
and we were the only boat
left standing,
Bubba Gump shrimp's
what they got.
We got a whole bunch of boats.
12 Jennys, big old warehouse.
We even have hats
that say "Bubba Gump" on them.
Bubba Gump Shrimp.
Lùs a household name.
Hold on there, boy.
Are you telling me
you're the owner
of the Bubba Gump
Shrimp Corporation?
Yes. We got more money
than Davy Crockett.
Boy, I heard some whoppers
in my time,
but that tops them all.
Ha ha ha ha!
We were sitting
next to a millionaire.
Well, I thought it was
a very lovely story,
and you tell it so well,
with such enthusiasm.
Would you like to see
what Lieutenant Dan looks like?
Yes, I would.
Thaùs him right there.
Let me tell you
something about Lieutenant Dan.
Forrest...
I never thanked you
for saving my life.
He never actually said so,
but I think
he made his peace with God.
[Gunshots]
For the second time in 17 days,
President Ford escaped
possible assassination today.
Base to Jenny 1.
Base to Jenny 1.
Jenny 1. Go, Margo.
Forrest has a phone call.
Yeah, well, you'll have
to tell them to call him back.
He is indisposed at the moment.
His mama's sick.
Where's Mama?
She's upstairs.
Hi, Forrest.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Oh, all right.
Sure got you straightened out,
didn't we, boy?
Whaùs the matter, Mama?
I'm dying, Forrest.
Come on in,
sit down over here.
Why are you dying, Mama?
Lùs my time.
Lùs just my time.
Oh, now...
don't you be afraid,
sweetheart.
Death is just a part of life.
Something we're all
destined to do.
I didn't know it,
but I was destined
to be your mama.
I did the best I could.
You did good.
Well... I happen to believe
you make your own destiny.
You have to do the best
with what God gave you.
Whaùs my destiny, Mama?
You're going to have
to figure that out for yourself.
Life is a box
of chocolates, Forrest.
You never know what
you're going to get.
Mama always had a way
of explaining things
so I could understand them.
I will miss you, Forrest.
She had got the cancer
and died on a Tuesday.
I bought her a new hat
with little flowers on it.
And thaùs all I have
to say about that.
Didn't you say you were waiting
for the number 7 bus?
There'll be another one
along shortly.
Now, because I had been
a football star and war hero
and national celebrity
and a shrimping boat captain
and a college graduate,
the city fathers
of Greenbow, Alabama,
decided to get together
and offered me a fine job.
So I never went back to work
for Lieutenant Dan,
though he did take care
of my Bubba Gump money.
He got me invested
in some kind of fruit company.
So then I got a call from him
saying we don't have to worry
about money no more,
and I said,
"Thaùs good. One less thing."
# I've got a new hope... ##
Now Mama said
there's only so much fortune
a man really needs,
and the rest
isjust for showing off.
So I gave a whole bunch of it
to the Foursquare Gospel Church...
and I gave a whole bunch to the
Bayou La Batre Fishing Hospital...
and even though Bubba was dead
and Lieutenant Dan said I was nuts,
I gave Bubba's mama Bubba's share.
You know what?
She didn't have to work
in nobody's kitchen no more.
That smells wonderful.
And 'cause I was a gozillionaire
and I liked doing it so much,
I cut that grass for free.
But at nighttime
when there was nothing to do
and the house was all empty,
I'd always think ofJenny.
And then... she was there.
Hello, Forrest.
Hello, Jenny.
Jenny came back
and stayed with me.
Maybe it was because
she had nowhere else to go,
or maybe it was because
she was so tired
'cause she went to bed
and slept and slept
like she hadn't slept in years.
It was wonderful
having her home.
Every day we'd take a walk,
and I'djabber on
like a monkey in a tree,
and she'd listen about
Ping-Ponging and shrimping
and Mama making
a trip up to heaven.
I did all the talking.
Jenny most of the time
was real quiet.
How could you do this?
Sometimes I guess there
just aren't enough rocks.
I never really knew
why she came back,
but I didn't care.
It was like olden times.
We was like
peas and carrots again.
Every day,
I'd pick pretty flowers
and put them in her room for her,
and she gave me the best gift
anyone could ever get
in the wide world.
They're made just for running.
#Carry me home to see my kin #
And she even showed me
how to dance.
#I miss ol'Bammy once again #
#And I think iùs a sin #
#Sweet home Alabama... ##
Well, we was like family,
Jenny and me...
and it was the happiest time
in my life.
You done watching it?
Mm-hmm.
I'm going to bed.
Will you marry me?
I'd make a good husband, Jenny.
You would, Forrest.
But you won't marry me.
You don't want to marry me.
Why don't you love me, Jenny?
I'm not a smart man,
but I know what love is.
Jenny...
Forrest, I do love you.
Where are you running off to?
I'm not running.
That day,
for no particular reason,
I decided to go for a little run.
So I ran to the end of the road,
and when I got there, I thought
maybe I'd run to the end of town.
[TV] President Carter,
suffering from heat exhaustion...
And when I got there,
I thought maybe I'djust
run across Greenbow County.
Now, I figured
since I'd run this far,
maybe I'djust run across
the great state of Alabama.
And thaùs what I did.
I ran clear across Alabama.
No particular reason.
I just kept on going.
I ran clear to the ocean.
And when I got there,
I figured since
I'd gone this far,
might as well turn around,
just keep on going.
And when I got to another ocean,
I figured since
I'd gone this far...
I might as well just turn back
and keep right on going.
When I got tired, I slept.
When I got hungry, I ate.
When I had to go...
you know...
I went.
And so...
you just ran.
Yeah.
# Lookin' out at the road
rushin' under my wheels #
# Lookin' back
at the years gone by #
# Like so many summer fields #
# In '65, I was 17 #
#And runnin' up one on one #
# I don't know
where I'm runnin' now #
# I'm just runnin' on #
# Runnin' on #
# Runnin' on empty #
# Runnin' on #
# Runnin' dry #
# Runnin' on... ##
I'd think a lot...
about Mama and Bubba
and Lieutenant Dan.
But most of all,
I thought about Jenny.
I thought about her a lot.
For more than two years,
a man named Forrest Gump,
a gardener from Greenbow, Alabama,
stopping only to sleep,
has been running across America.
Charles Cooper
brings you this report.
For the fourth time
on hisjourney across America,
Forrest Gump, the gardener
from Greenbow, Alabama,
is about to cross
the Mississippi River again today.
I'll be damned. Forrest?
Sir, where are you running?
Are you doing this
for world peace?
Are you doing this
for the homeless?
Are you running
for women's rights?
The environment?
They just couldn't believe
that somebody would do
all that running
for no particular reason.
Why are you doing this?
I just felt like running.
I just felt like runnin'.
Thaùs you.
I can't believe iùs really you.
Now... for some reason,
what I was doing seemed to...
make sense to people.
It was like an alarm
went off in my head.
I said, "Here's a guy
thaùs got his act together.
Here's somebody
who has the answer."
I'll follow you
anywhere, Mr. Gump.
So I got company.
And after that,
I got more company.
And then, even
more peoplejoined in.
Somebody later told me
it gave people hope.
Now...
Now, I don't know
anything about that,
but some of those people asked me
if I could help them out.
I was wondering
if you might help me.
I'm in the bumper sticker business.
I need a good slogan,
and since you've
been so inspirational,
I thought you might
be able to help me...
Whoa, man! You just ran
through a big pile of dog shit!
It happens.
What, shit?
Sometimes.
And some years later,
I heard that that fella
did come up with
a bumper sticker slogan
and made a lot of money
off of it.
Another time,
I was running along.
Somebody who'd lost all his money
in the T-shirt business,
he wanted to put my face
on a T-shirt,
but he couldn't draw that well,
and he didn't have a camera.
Here, use this one.
Nobody likes that color anyway.
[Horn Honks]
Have a nice day.
Some years later, I found out
that that man did come up
with an idea for a T-shirt.
He made a lot of money.
Anyway, like I was saying,
I had a lot of company.
My mama always said,
"You got to put the past
behind you
before you can move on."
And I think thaùs
what my running was all about.
I had run for three years...
two months...
14 days, and 16 hours.
Quiet. Quiet.
He's going to say something.
I'm pretty tired.
Think I'll go home now.
Now what are we supposed to do?
Andjust like that...
my runnin'days was over.
So I went home to Alabama.
[TV]
Moments ago, at 2.25 P.M.,
as President Reagan
was leaving the...
[Gunshots]
Five or six gunshots were fired
by an unknown, would-be assassin.
The president was
shot in the chest...
I picked up the mail.
And one day, out
of the blue clear sky,
I got a letter from Jenny
wondering if I could
come down to Savannah
and see her, and thaùs
what I'm doing here.
Uh-huh.
She saw me on TV... running.
I'm supposed to go on
the number 9 bus to Richmond Street
and get off and go one block left
to 1947 Henry Street...
apartment 4.
Why, you don't need
to take a bus.
Henry Street is just
five or six blocks...
down that way.
Down that way?
Down that way.
It was nice talking to you.
[Horn Honks]
I hope everything
works out for you!
Hey!
Forrest!
How you doin'?
Come in! Come in!
I got your letter.
Oh, I was wondering
about that.
This your house?
Yeah. Lùs messy right now.
I just got off work.
Lùs nice.
You got air-conditioning.
Uh...
Thank you.
I ate some.
I, uh, kept... kept a scrapbook
of... of your clippings and...
everything. There you are.
Yes, I got you running.
I ran a long way.
Lùs a long time.
There...
Listen, Forrest,
I don't know how to say this.
Um...
I just...
I want to apologize
for anything that I ever
did to you 'cause...
I was messed up...
for a long time, and...
[Knock On Door]
Yoo-hoo!
Hey!
Hi.
Hey, you.
This is my old friend
from Alabama.
How do you do?
[Jenny] Next week
my schedule changes, so I can...
No problem. Got to go.
I'm double-parked.
O.K. Thanks.
This is my
very good friend Mr. Gump.
Can you say hi?
Hello, Mr. Gump.
Hello.
Can I go watch TV now?
Yes. Just keep it low.
You're a mama, Jenny.
I'm a mama.
His name's Forrest.
Like me!
I named him after his daddy.
He got a daddy
named Forrest, too?
You're his daddy, Forrest.
Hey...
Forrest, look at me.
Look at me, Forrest.
There's nothing you need to do.
You didn't do anything wrong.
O. K?
Isn't he beautiful?
He's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.
But...
is... is he s-smart? Like, can he...
He's very smart.
He's one of
the smartest in his class.
Yeah, iùs O.K.
Go talk to him.
What are you watching?
Bert and Ernie.
Forrest...
I'm sick.
What, do you have
a cough due to a cold?
I have some kind of virus,
and the doctors,
they don't know what it is,
and there isn't anything
they can do about it.
You could come home with me.
Jenny, you and...
little Forrest
could come stay
at my house in Greenbow.
I'll take care of you
if you're sick.
Would you marry me, Forrest?
O.K.
[Man]
Please take your seats.
Forrest?
Lùs time to start.
Hi.
Your tie.
Lieutenant Dan.
Lieutenant Dan.
Hello, Forrest.
You got new legs.
New legs!
Yeah. I got new legs.
Custom-made.
Titanium alloy.
Lùs what they use
on the space shuttle.
Magic legs.
This...
is my fiancÈe.
Susan.
Lieutenant Dan.
Hi, Forrest.
Lieutenant Dan...
this is my Jenny.
Hi. Lùs nice
to meet you finally.
Do you, Forrest, take Jenny
to be your wife?
Do you, Jenny, take Forrest
to be your husband?
And so I pronounce you
man and wife.
Hi.
Hi.
Hey, Forrest...
were you scared in Vietnam?
Yes.
Well, I...
I don't know.
Sometimes it would stop raining
long enough for
the stars to come out...
and then it was nice.
It was like just
before the sun goes to bed
down on the bayou.
There was always
a million sparkles on the water...
like that mountain lake.
It was so clear, Jenny,
it looked like
there were two skies
one on top of the other.
And then in the desert,
when the sun comes up...
I couldn't tell
where heaven stopped
and the earth began.
Lùs so beautiful.
I wish I coulÔve
been there with you.
You were.
I love you.
[Gump]
You died on a Saturday morning.
And I had you placed
here under our tree.
And I had that house
of your father's
bulldozed to the ground.
Mama...
always said
that dyin' was a part of life.
I sure wish it wasn't.
Little Forrest is...
doing just fine.
"But..."
About to start school again soon,
and...
and I make his breakfast,
lunch, and dinner
every day.
I make sure he...
combs his hair
and brushes his teeth every day.
Teaching him how
to play Ping-Pong.
He's really good.
Uh, Forrest, you go.
Uhh!
We fish a lot.
And every night,
we read a book.
He's so smart, Jenny.
You'd be so proud of him.
I am.
He, uh, wrote you
a... a letter.
And he says I can't read it.
I'm not supposed to,
so I'll just leave it
here for you.
Jenny...
I don't know
if Mama was right
or if it... iùs
Lieutenant Dan.
I don't know...
if we each have a...
destiny...
or if we're all just
floating around accidental-like
on a breeze...
but I... I think...
maybe iùs both.
Maybe both get happening
at the same time.
But I miss you, Jenny.
If there's anything
you need...
I won't be far away.
[Birds Chirping]
Here's your bus.
O.K.
Hey...
I know this.
I'm gonna share that
for show-and-tell
because Grandma used
to read it to you.
My favorite book.
Here we are.
Hey...
here you go.
Hey, Forrest...
don't...
I want to tell you
I love you.
I love you, too, Daddy.
I'll be right here
when you get back.
[Pop]
You understand this is the bus
to school, now, don't you?
Of course, and you're Dorothy
Harris, and I'm Forrest Gump.
