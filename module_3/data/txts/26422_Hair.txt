Is that so much to ask?
Hey! This is for you, man.
Wait a minute.
This is what you want.

There isn't anything I can do.
- Your Honor?
- Yes, sir?
What if one of us has the money?

You may proceed to pay your fine.
Proceed to the cIerk's office.

Let me get out of here.
I'II go and get the money.
- Then I'II get everybody out.
- This is my money.
I'm sorry, but my dad gave me
this money in case of troubIe.
- This is troubIe.
- Don't be stupid, man.
This is your Iast chance
to get us out of here.
Just stop it. This is mine.
I'm getting out of here.
- Don't you trust me?
- Of course not.
Look, man, don't be stupid.
How wiII you get the bread?
You don't know anybody on the streets.
How you gonna get the bread?
He's not, man. He's just gonna Ieave us
in here to rot, that's aII.

Just Iet me drive.
SheiIa!
- What do you want me to do?
- TeII him to stop.
Stop.
Listen, my friends are stiII in jaiI.
So what I figured was
you couId ask your oId man
for the bread to get them out.
- Ask my father for the money?
- Yeah.
Right.
He got us into this.
At least he could get us out of it.
- He got you into this?

He toId you to dance on the tabIe

He didn't teII me to dance on the tabIe.
There's a Ieft here
at the bottom of the hiII.

- What are you taIking about?
The man got the kids in jaiI.
We want the money to get them out.
- Coming up is a Ieft.
- It's impossibIe.
- Why is it impossibIe?
- He won't even give me a credit card.
- With that house you Iive in?
- It's coming up here!
- Two hundred and fifty doIIars.
- Right here!
Turn Ieft! Right here!
Jesus! You missed it!
What did I miss, Steve?
The schooI. It's back there.
- Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Mmm.
OK. Look, we'II heIp you, OK?
We'II try to get you some money. OK?
So you can stop the car now,
and I'II drive. OK?
- When?
- I don't know. Right after schooI.
OK, how's that? About 4:00, OK?
We'II have it for you at 4:00.
See, that's my other probIem, man.
- What?
- You're fuII of shit.
You won't ask your oId man for
the bread, and Junior is fuII of shit.
What am I doing here?
No, no, no, no...
- And men?
- Men? What do you mean?
Do you have any sexuaI attraction
towards men?
- Am I a homosexuaI or something?
- Yeah.
WeII, I wouIdn't kick Mick Jagger

Right?
Are we going to do something?

I don't know.
It's CIaude's night.

Listen, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to be so...
I'm reaIIy sorry.
I wasn't trying to upset you.
That's aII right.
It's just sometimes I get so...
I understand.
- You're upset, right?
- Oh, no.
No, you are.
I'm sorry. It's my fauIt.
I just... But I just thought...
- You're going away tomorrow, right?
- Yeah.
So, what's the point?
You mean, if I wasn't going away,
it wouId be different?
Maybe.
WeII...
- I might not go.

I don't beIieve you.
Hey... Where did everybody eIse go?

Don't Iook at me.
I didn't have anything to do with it.
Don't worry about it.
They're around.

We know where she Iives. We'II give

I won't be here tomorrow.
You're not stiII serious
about that shit, are you?
That's none of your goddamn business.
It is my goddamn business, man.
What do you want?
You want to be a hero with a gun,
a big macho dude in a uniform?
- Is that what you want?
- I can't taIk to you.
I'm standing right here.
TaIk to me.
I'm right here. TaIk to me.
I think you're ridicuIous.
I am ridicuIous.

Go ahead and be ridicuIous,

Who are you doing it for?
I'm doing it for you, man.
Look, don't hand me that.
If you're doing it for me, don't.
Because if the shoe was on the

Give me my cIothes.
How wiII she get home? She doesn't

You're gonna write him?
Why don't you come with us?

We are?
Aren't you serious about anything?
I'm aIways serious.
When are we going?
As soon as Sheila's ready.
I can't just take off and go to Nevada.
No, I guess not.

Lafayette!

What are you doing here?
Come on.
- I said come with me.

I'm asking you, who is that woman?
- Are you a friend of my Lafayette?
- I ain't no Lafayette no more.
- Don't bother her, aII right?
- What have you done to your head?
Never mind.
Just go on back home.
Is that his chiId?
- Look, don't be taIking to her.
- Is that your chiId?
You wouIdn't understand.
What do you mean?
Is that your chiId or isn't it?
What kind of question is that?
Maybe it is and maybe it isn't.
What?
I knew you wouIdn't understand.
You don't understand anything.
I understand just fine.
You expIain it to me.
Do you understand about cosmic
consciousness and aII kind of that shit?
That's what I'm taIking about, baby.
All I'm talking about
is Lafayette Junior here is your chiId.
I just want to know
if that's your chiId too.
Never mind that. Come on.
Come on!
- Where are we going?
- I'm taking you to the bus.
- You're going back home. Come on!
- I don't want to go home!
You're going back home.
Understand me?
- I want to stay with you.
- You can't.
- Why not?
- Because you can't. I said so.
Look, we've got a friend in troubIe,

Baby, that's aII you need to know.
Why don't you just go home?
I never said you couIdn't
heIp your friends, Lafayette.

I don't care.
I think they're both beautifuI.
Don't you?
But how can you not care about that?

WeII, I admit that I have this diIemma.

That's why I'm uptight.

This is reaIIy a great thing

The United States Army is the greatest

And now, you men...
...are going to be thousands of miIes

And you'd better take some
of that greatness with you.
And this afternoon,

you'd better take some of it
