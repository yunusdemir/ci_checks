25 cents an hour,
six hours a day,
five years.
That's 1,740 dollars.
Not much for all that laundry, huh Lucas?
Good luck.
Don't come back.
Inmate Lucas released
on parole. Open the gate.
Good luck, Lucas.
I thought you might be lonesome.
I missed you.
- Five years is a long time.
- I agree.
Should have been ten,
I would have missed you more.
What a performance you must
have given that parole board.
Are you done?
But, I try to look at
the bright side, Lucas.
You get out, knock over
a bank or jewelry store
and I practically make lieutenant.
- Don't count on me
for any more promotions.
- All right.
I'm done. Sorry to disappoint you.
I don't want to die on the inside.
Ya, Lucas, you'll be the
straightest man in the world,
and one day you walk past a
bank and the fun will begin again.
- You think so?
- You want a bet?
Okay Dugan, I'll rob a bank for you.
Give me a ride.
You want me to drive you to a bank?
Here we are, Pacific National.
By, thanks for the ride, guys.
- You don't think he's
going to do it, do you?
- No.
He's nuts but he's not that...
At least I don't think he is.
Be just great if he hits the bank
we just drove him to.
Be just great if you shut up. Lets go.
Excuse me, new accounts please.
Thank you.
- I'd like to open a new account, please.
- Have a seat.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Think he's really going straight?
Naw, 14 armed robberies?
14! Those guys don't make career changes.
I don't know.
I kind of had a feeling he was serious.
I kind of had a feeling you're naive.
Next time I get him, it won't
be for a lousy 5 years.
- Present employer?
- I'm between jobs.
Everybody, hands up! Hands up!
Stick them up! This is a hold up!
I said stick 'em up!
You see this?
You know what this is?
It's a grenade, and I'm pulling the pin.
So no funny business!
You know, if I drop this thing,
it's going to go off
and you'll all be blown
to smitherines, so move it!
Move it!
Move it! Move it! Get moving!
Get moving over there!
Move it!
You two! Will you speed it up?
Come on!
All right. Keep those hands up!
Okay, that's good. You, take this!
Well, put money in it. Come on!
Come on! Come on!

48th and Wells.
Freeze!
All available units, 2-11 silent

48th and Wells.
All units handle code 3 and high.
Dugan here. Would you repeat?
We have a 2-11 in progress
at Pacific National Bank.
48th and Wells.
Holy shit!
Okay, that's enough, enough, enough!
Just zip it up and throw it here!
- You did that on purpose!
- I swear I didn't!
Nobody move!
Keep those hands up, up!
Unhook that God damned
bag for Christ sakes!
Get it down everybody
or I blow this place up!
23, what's your position, give me a call.
All right, let's get the back doors!
Move it.
Come on! Come on!
This is the police!
The bank is surrounded.
Come out with your hands up,
and you will not get hurt.
I repeat.
Come out with your hands up,
and you will not get hurt.
- I can't believe we gave him a ride.
- Shut up!
- The grenade!
- Nobody move or I'll shoot!
- You! You're coming with me!
- Pick someone else.
What?
Give yourself up.
You don't have a chance!
Get moving, come on!
- Here he comes.
- I still can't believe it.
I got a hostage!
- Let me through or I'll kill him!
- Shit!
- I got a hostage!
- Okay, be cool. Let's talk about it.
- Still can't believe it, smart ass?
- Holy shit!
You asshole!
- Excuse me?
- You're a fucking asshole!
What's his game here?
Okay, Lucas, I'm listening.
Tell us what you want.
I don't want anything.
I'm the hostage.
- What did he say?
- He said he's the hostage.
What kind of jerk does he think I am?
Cut the bull shit, Lucas.
- Tell him.
- Tell him what?
- That I'm the hostage, you shit!
- Of course you're the hostage.
What do you think?
Don't tell me, asshole, tell them!
Excuse me, I think I'm going to faint.
No! The grenade!
Stand up you asshole, stand up!
What the hell is going on here?
Who's got the gun, for God's sake,
Dugan. Who's got the gun?
For Christ sake, pick up
your weapon, asshole.
What a disgrace!
Pick up your weapon!
Hold your gun like a man, for Christ sake!
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
Those sons of bitches!
These people are insane!
That was totally unjustified.
The bastards want my ass! Dugan!
Dugan!
- Your ass? Why your ass?
- Dugan, do you hear me?
Excuse me, you said they wanted
your ass. Why wou...
Shut up! Dugan!
Come on out here, Lucas.
You know the procedure.
- Okay, okay, I'm coming out.
- Wait a minute!
I had nothing to do with this.
So everybody just...
I'm unarmed, I'm unarmed!
- Don't you move!
- Here I come!
- What the hell are you doing?
- You've got five seconds.
- Dugan, listen to me!
- One!
Two!
- Three!
- Asshole! He's going to do it!
Dugan! Don't be stupid, man!
I'll kill the hostage! You hear me?
I'll kill him!
- You'll kill the hostage?
- Give me that!
Hey! Give it to me, God damned it.
Okay, Lucas, okay.
Tell us what you want.
We're listening.
- I want to make it to my car.
Don't try to stop me.
- Shut up!
First, the guys off the roof!
Then, you unblock the street!
Let's move! Let's move!
- Where's your car?
- What the hell is going on here?
- Where's your god damed car?
- Over there.
All right, let's go.
- Give me the keys.
- First give me the gun.
Give me the keys, asshole!
Before we're killed!
This is my robbery!
Now, I don't know what
you're trying to pull,
but if you think you can weasel
my money away from me,
you're greatly mistaken!
Give me back my gun
or I'll blow us both up!
I'll do it.
Sorry.
Terribly sorry. Shoot me.
Why did they shoot?
He never shot anybody.
Suspect headed west on 48.
Yellow, 78 Datsun.
Establish perimeter.
Seal the end of state. Out.
We got that sucker!
Want me to drive?
If you're not feeling
up to it, I'd be happy...
I said I was sorry, didn't I?
Look out!
I'm really sorry.
The grenade!
It didn't work?
No, it worked.
Hey?
Are you okay?
Hello? Are you okay?
Five years in jail!
Five years!
- I just got out this morning.
You have me up to my neck in shit!
- Sorry.
You're turning yourself in!
You're clearing me completely!
You tell them I'm innocent
or I will blow your head off!
Just listen! Let me go!
- Christ!
- All because I blew a holdup!
All because pulled off
14 holdups, asshole!
How was I to know who you were?
I just took a hostage.
I had nothing against you personally.
Hey! I'm in the shit too, you know!
Ah, shut up!
Where are we going?
What the hell...?
Hey, what do you think you're doing?
No! Not the cops!
I don't want to do this!
Hey. What's going on here?
Please! I'm not going to prison!
I can't go to prison!
No!
Asshole wants to make a statement.
Go on!
No, I got nothing to say.
Let go!
You've got nothing to say?
Nothing to say, you scum bag!
You shit! You asshole!
Hey, hey, easy! Easy! Watch it!
Come on!
Take it easy! Take it easy!
Just tell your story, okay?
This asshole pulled a hold up.
He took me hostage,
they thought I did it.
He's lying, he's a complete lier!
What's this, huh? What's this?
- PNB job. That's Lucas!
- Hands up! Both of you.
I haven't done anything.
He set the whole thing up.
Arrest him. He's the one!
Just get them up, I said, get them up!
What did you just say?
I warned you,
I am not going to prison.
Get them up, or I'll shoot!
Freeze!
My money!
I could have jumped a lot higher than that.
I'm a basketball player at the Y, you know.
- I'm short, but very fast.
- What about him?
- What about him?
- He do anything unusual?
- No.
- They didn't talk to each other
or anything like that?
No, he was just a customer.
Oh, look at this, look at this.
Watch this thing I do right here.
- Shit, I stood out of camera!
- Well, thanks a lot Mr. Filbert.
No problem, is it possible for me
to get a copy of this tape?
- How about there?
- This was a very dangerous moment.
He was being very threatening.
And then this guy.
That was the customer
you were asking about.
- He must have gotten scared or
something because he yells: "The grenade!".
- Why?
- I'm sorry?
- Why'd he help him?
- Maybe he was afraid.
- Anyone could have been taken hostage.
Why Lucas?
Why not Kareem here?
I'll tell you why.
These two guys... they're a team.
Beat it, before I change my mind.
Shit! Piss, go to hell!
You have been nothing but trouble!
Why do people take hostages?
For protection, right?
But you... you turn out
to be this big pain in the ass.
Christ, the only reason I robbed
that God damned bank,
because I needed the money.
So go ahead, kill me.
But I'm not getting out of
this car without my money!
Get out of here.
What are you going to do?
You lost a lot of blood.
Slide over.
I know someone who can take care of you.
He's not far from here.
Come on. Move over. Hurry.
I'll go get some help.
- Canvas. Cover the car.
- Okay.
He's a friend of my dad's.
Very nice guy. He does a good job.
Hope he's home.
Doctor Horvath?
Doctor Horvath?
Doctor Horvath?
There. Okay.
You lie here, or I'll get him.
No, this is a doctor.
He'll call the cops.
They have to report gunshot wounds.
No he won't.
He's a friend on my dad's.
There's no such thing as friends.
If he's a doctor, he'll have to report it.
He's not a doctor.
He's a veterinarian and not
the kind to call the cops, either.
Doctor Horvath?
Doctor Horvath?
Doctor Horvath?
Who is it?
Hi, Doctor Horvath, remember me?
- Ned Perry.
- George, my boy,
how nice of you to visit me.
No, I'm not George, I'm Ned.
George is my father.
- I need your help sir.
- What?
A friend of mine has been hurt.
I brought him in to see you.
He's in the examining room.
Hurt? I haven't practiced in years, George.
Yes, I know, but he's really in
bad shape, sir. And I didn't
know where else to go, so.
Please, Dr. Horvath, look him over.
It's urgent.
Look him over? But I don't know
how any more, George.
What breed is he?
No, he's not a dog, Doctor Horvath.
He's... come and see...
- God... he's going to shit
all over the place.
- No, he won't, he's house broken.
What is this?
A friend. He's been
wounded in the thigh.
He's lost a lot of blood.
But I'm not a doctor, George.
I know. But can you just take out the
bullet and bandage the wound?
Bullets? Why, who shot him?
Poor little doggy. Was he hunting?
Took him for a rabbit, eh?
Stupid hunters.
- Are you okay, doctor Horvath?
- I'm okay, George.
- Hot, very hot.
- What is this crap?
- Easy boy. Easy boy...
- Maybe I should take him someplace else.
Easy boy.
Doctor Horvath? We're not going
to bother you any longer, okay?
George, go and get the alcohol.
It's all right. You stay there.
You stay right here.
I'll take care of you.
You'll be fine, you just lay there.
Dr. Horvath will take care of you.
You'll be better in no time.
You'll see.
- Think you can do it, Dr. Horvath?
- I'll do what I can, George.
Nasty wound. Very nasty.
Poor little poochie.
I have no anesthetic.
Here, bite on this.
Get me out of here!
Be better to put him to sleep.
Ned Perry, male, Caucasian.
5'8'', 135 pounds.
He's 32 years years old, no record.
He worked 11 years in the
same place Northwest Lumber.
He was a sales manager.
Two years ago his wife died.
He cracked.
Couldn't do his job, apparently.
They laid him off.
Lately, he does telephone sales.
Magazines.
Why doesn't he just get a better job?
A breakdown. Would you hire him?
A sure thing is, I wouldn't
hire him to rob a bank.
The daughter's six.
She's not normal.
What's wrong with her?
Don't know, exactly,
she's in a special school.
Must have cost a fortune.
This guy doesn't fit Lucas' MO.
Doesn't make sense.
Nothing makes sense with
Lucas and this screw up.
Just in case, send a car
to the kid's school.
Sorry, pumpkin, daddy's late.
Have you been waiting long?
Have you? Dr. Horvath's car.
Remember Dr. Horvath,
The veterinarian?
Come on honey.
Hurry up. Let's get in.
Hey, what's that?
Okay.
Go! Adam one, requesting backup.
We are in pursuit PNB suspect,
headed North, Wells and 54th Street.
Don't be afraid, sweetheart,
everything's fine. Everything's okay.
He's still sleeping. I don't like that.
Ah! He's waking up.
- No, No, Dr. Horvath, that's from outside.
- Ah yes, you're right.
Too bad.
I'd like to have him
wake up barking like that.
Do you remember my little girl, Meg?
I brought her here about
two or three years ago?
Yes. No.
Isn't she adorable?
Hello, kitten.
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Hello.
Hi there.
Hi. Do you remember me?
- Asshole?
- Yes, it's me. How you feeling?
I'm not doing that great myself.
There's a lot of cops out there.
I mean, I'm in trouble.
It's sort-of your fault, you know.
No, it's true.
In fact, no offence but,
because of you, every cop
in the state is on my ass.
What do you want me to do? Cry?
- No, I want you to help me.
- What?
I have to get out of the country.
And I need a fake ID.
I don't have a clue where to
get that sort of stuff, you know?
And you being a felon,
I mean, you know these things.
Right?
You gotta help me.
Drop dead.
You know why I robbed
that bank this morning?
For my little girl who's sick.
To pay for this special school
she goes to.
They're not going to put me in jail.
They're not going to
take her away from me.
What's it to me?
I couldn't pay my rent either and
I was just about to be thrown out.
When you're homeless, and
they take you children away.
That's why I'm in this mess.
Please help me.
Look...
If I am arrested, I am
going to drag you into this.
I'm going to make you look guilty as hell.
I know that's a terrible thing to do,
but I'm going to do it anyway.
Because the only thing that
matters to me is my little girl.
I'm sorry about this. I really am.
Good bye.
- Asshole?
- Yes?
Bring me that phone.
Ya? Hold on.
Boss, it's for you.
- Ya?
- Charlie, it's been five years.
You know who this is?
Ya, I got out early.
Listen, I need some paper
goods for a friend of mine.
Today, when do you think?
All right. He's on his way.
It's the King Salmon Bar, 4th and Water.
Ask for Charlie.
200 dollars for a driver's license,
500 for a passport.
Got it. Thanks. Thanks a million.
- Beat it.
- Right.
Should I take this?
I'll just... I'll leave it here then.
Do I take a bus or walk or what?
- Walk.
- Right.
- Don't look anyone
in the eye on the street.
- Why not?
There's a rule.
When you're on the lamb,
you don't want to be noticed.
So you keep your head down
and your eyes on the ground.
Got it. Anything else?
You got no friends any more.
Remember that.
Be suspicious of everyone.
Got it. Anything else?
You're an asshole?
Beat it. I'm tired.
- Meg?
- What the hell are you doing?
- I just want to introduce you
to my daughter.
- No!
- It'll take a second.
- No kids, especially yours.
This is my daughter. Her name's Meg.
Listen baby, daddy has to run
an errand. So I'm going to leave
you with this gentleman. Okay?
Now, he's sick, so you
have to watch over him.
- I don't need anything.
- Let me do this.
Understand, sweetheart?
He's very, very weak,
like a little baby.
So you have to protect him.
I don't want a kid in here pestering me.
I want to be left alone.
No, don't worry, she won't bother you.
She doesn't talk.
She hasn't opened her mouth
for almost two years,
since her mother died.
- Hey, you all right?
- Yes, fine.
- Better watch where you're going buddy.
- Yes.
Dio.
Excuse me, I want to see...
- Who?
- Charlie.
- What do you want to see Mr. Charlie for?
- A friend called a while ago.
A friend who disappeared
five years ago.
This way.
- So how's our friend doing?
- Fine.
Sit down.
He didn't waste any time, did he?
Gets out and boom, hits a bank.
That's balls.
I'm kind-of in a hurry.
Well, excuse me.
I didn't realize you were in a hurry.
Ya, well...
May I ask you if you brought ID photos?
Yes, I did.
Still wet. I just got them
on the way over here.
These are terrific of you.
You really are a very cute.
And you know, of course, the price?
500 for a passport.
No, no, no.
That was the price five years ago.
Now it's 50,000.
- What?
- 50,000. Special price for friends.
- Dollars?
- I'm not talking about pesos, sweetheart.
I don't have that. Where am I
supposed to find 50,000 dollars.
Maybe at the Pacific National Bank.
- There was never any 50,000
dollars at the Pacific bank.
- How much was there?
Look, I don't believe we were speaking...
How much was there?
Did you hear what Mr. Charlie said?
- How much was there?
- 13,000.
Sit down.
Lucas wouldn't get mixed up in
anything for a lousy 13 grand.
No... no, Lucas didn't pull the hold up.
- He was my hostage.
- What?
Yes. I robbed the bank... this morning,
and I took him hostage.
He says he took Lucas hostage.
- No, it's the truth, it is.
- You didn't hurt him, I hope?
Well, I kind of shot him.
- Oh? Did you?
- Yes.
- Where?
- In the car.
In the car.
You tell Lucas 50,000 bucks,
or we hand you over to the cops.
I said I want to be left alone!
Hello.
It's Charlie, we're with
your friend, I'll put him on.
They want 50,000 dollars.
50,000 or they turn me over to the cops.
- No, just tell them that
I took you hostage, okay?
- So?
What is this hostage shit?
He took you hostage?
This little fart? Who are you kidding?
No, you listen to me!
Either I get $50,000 in 24 hours or
Al Capone here can tell
his story to the cops.
Get out of here!
Just stay away from me!
Do you hear me?
Hello? Anybody home?
Dr. Horvath?
- Afternoon.
- Afternoon.
- Dr. Horvath's not here?
- No.
Well, we're probably a little early.
He told us to come by about five.
Honey, don't be afraid of him.
He won't bite you.
He only eats thieves.
Max! Leave that man alone now!
There you go.
So. You a friend of Dr. Horvath's, are you?
Patient.
Yes sir, that's a good one.
Well, so is Max, aren't you, boy?
Hey Max?
You love Dr. Horvath, do you?
Ya.
Tell you what... sir,
you're going to see a hell
of a reunion in a few minutes.
Dr. Horvath saved his life
four years ago when he got
shot by a bank robber.
Every month, same reunion.
Ya, Max.
Max, come on now.
Ya.
Hey, Max
Don't pester that man!
Hey honey, would you like to
have a big dog like that some day?
What's the matter,
kitty cat got your tongue?
Yes.
K-914, this is 12-Adam-one
at Kenwood Plaza.
Requesting K-9 for suspect search.
Ya this is K-914 responding
from 173 Barrows Road.
We're on our way.
Well, so much for that reunion, huh?
It's that PNB job. He's a big fish.
We've been chasing him since this morning.
We'll probably be back a little later.
This guy's wounded.
Can't hold out much longer.
Hey Max. A wounded man
is a piece of cake, isn't he, huh?
Ya. Come on boy, heel!
Let's go! Hee...
Attack!
- Attack!
- Max! Hello!
Attack, God damn it!
What's going on there?
Down, Max, down.
Get out of here! You're in my way!
You hear me?
Beat it!
Down there.
Any trouble, then I'll call the cops.
No! I have a little girl.
She's not well.
I have to look after her.
Please, let me go!
You sleep here, big guy?
This is our place. I'm going to
need a little rent for the room.
You deaf? Your money.
Your pants.
Hurry up, jerk-off,
or I'll put a hole in them.
I want you to wait right here?
You understand? Don't budge.
How come you don't talk?
How about moving a little bit, man?
Come on, buddy,
get the hell out of the way.
You wait right here, you understand?
What do you mean
"I'm loosing my nerve"?
Me loose my nerve?
- Screw you "loosing my nerve"!
- You're loosing your nerve.
Look. All I'm saying is that
Lucas is a very tough customer.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the can, why,
is that a crime?
He's loosing everything.
I'll take care of our tough customer, okay?
No problem.
When you're on the lamb,
you don't throw your weight around.
You make yourself very small.
Like Tinkerbell.
Itsy bitsy, teenie weenie.
Hia, Charlie.
You're nuts!
There are cops all over the place!
Go get him right now!
- I said go get him!
- Go get him!
Go get him!
You're on the lamb!
You're crazy to be doing this!
I'm not on the lamb. I was taken
hostage. And if my kidnapper
isn't here in 10 seconds,
I'll put a bullet up your ass!
Come on, let's go! Let's go!
- Where is she? Where's Meg?
- Get your ass in the truck!
Good to see you, Charlie.
Good seeing you too.
"It was I, and I alone who
committed this robbery."
"No charges should be brought
against Mr. Daniel Lucas
who is entirely innocent."
"Sincerely, Ned Perry".
Okay, it's all there.
Why I did it, I took you hostage...
shouldn't have any problems.
Come on, baby.
I guess that's it. Huh?
I can't imagine we'll be
seeing each other again.
Give yourself up.
Living on the run is hell.
She's too little. She can't take it.
Your money's back at the vet.
You got nothing to live on.
Be smart.
Don't have a record, you got
an honest face, they won't
give you more than a year.
But they'll put her in a childrens' home.
What's the big deal?
I was in one myself.
Ya, right. Look how nice you turned out.
You're an asshole.
Well, I gotta go.
Thank you for everything. Really.
- Don't go.
- Again, I'm...
There's something I have to
say to this man, sweetheart,
so we'll be right back, okay?
- What?
- She talked!
I heard.
So why are you whispering?
The doctor said I don't
want to block her again.
Make like nothing's happened.
I mustn't cry, don't let me cry.
Can't hang around here.
It's too dangerous.
Oh God, here it comes.
This is the happiest day in my life.
Two years I've been waiting.
- Do you have a handkerchief?
- No, I don't have a handkerchief.
Shoot.
Can you tell I've been crying?
She talked. Thanks to
you my little girl talked!
Well, here I go again.
- Better get moving.
- Yes, you're right.
Listen, you know what would be great?
- If you could maybe stay
with us maybe a little bit longer.
- What?
It's the first time she's asked
for something in two years.
Just, like a few hours.
Are you nuts? No way!
All right. I'll tell her.
I just hope it doesn't block her.
You tell her yourself. I gotta go.
- You won't even say good bye?
- No!
- Shit, here she comes!
- One hour. Just one hour.
I said no!
He can't stay, baby.
He'd like to, he really would,
but he can't.
If he does, the police
are going to hurt him.
And you don't want him
to be hurt, do you?
Don't go.
He's right. I can't stay.
But I'll be back, I promise.
Right now, you have to let me go.
Don't cry Meg, he'll come back. He will.
Daddy's here.
Hello.
Don't cry.
Meg!
Meg!
Meg! You bastard!
- You okay?
- Are you nuts?
- Yes I'm fine.
Don't you know where the crosswalk is?
- That's our guy!
- Let's get him!
Get in! Get in!
Go straight!
- Hurry up for Christ sake, hurry up!
- Shut up.
Car 8 to all patrols. We spotted Lucas.
He's in a beer truck.
License number 5-7-9-Sam-4-Boy.
We're finished!
- Wait! They'll shoot us!
- I have to find my daughter!
- This way!
- Hide!
All right. Spread out!
Take some men over there!
- We're screwed.
- Where is she?
What if something's
going to happen to her.
I don't like this. Something
terrible's going to happen.
They'll put her in an institution.
They'll kill her.
She won't be able to take it.
I'll kill myself.
Then they'll have two deaths in
their conscience, those bastards!
<i>- This way. Up at the top there.
- All right</i>
- Would you quit that?
- Quit yakking.
This place is crawling with cops.
You God damned asshole!
She'll go. I'll loose her.
- Look at her.
- She's so fragile.
Anyone could hurt her.
Who's that?
- What's he doing?
- Careful.
That's the kind of guy
who gives candy to little girls.
Don't be ridiculous.
So what's that, huh?
What's that, smart ass?
You shut the hell up!
She took it! I told her never
to take candy from strangers.
That pervert!
No, don't!
No!
Excuse me, officers,
I think this little girl is lost.
I asked where her mommy and
daddy are, she doesn't answer.
Come with me, sweetheart.
My little girl.
- My little girl.
- Now's our chance.
- Let's go!
- No, no.
Let's go!
Listen, you'll do one year at the most.
After that, you'll get her back.
I'll visit her while you're on
the inside. She won't be alone.
You've got my confession,
so just take off, okay?
- Goodbye and God bless.
- What are you going to do?
Hey! I'm talking to you!
When they put her in the childrens' home,
I'll kidnap her and then
get out of the country.
- Oh come on, don't be stupid...
- Leave me alone.
Please, leave me alone.
Sarge, it's for you.
Yes?
Get together with community
services, we can't keep
the kid here, that's for sure.
Fine.
- What have you got?
- Here's the case against Lucas to date.
The day of his release from jail,
Lucas robs a bank,
of less money and taking more
time than ever before.
- Maybe he's rusty.
- Then shoots himself in the leg.
Could have been a struggle.
Blows up his getaway car and then
tries to turn his hostage in to the police.
Lucas then goes for
medical care to a doctor Horvath.
I've interviewed him and...
I'd like you to hear him personally.
By the way, he's a veterinarian.
Doctor Horvath, please.
- Gentlemen.
- Have a seat, Doctor.
Now tell detective Dugan
everything you've told me.
The patient was shot
in a hunting accident.
- What?
- Wait, please Dr. Horvath.
In the right hind leg.
From the angle of entry,
it would appear that his leg was raised
and he must have been peeing
at the moment of impact.
- Thank you, doctor.
- Wait, I have more.
- Yes, wait, he has more.
- The patient wore no collar.
And he became enraged when
given a rubber bone.
- He never-the-less...
- Thank you very, very much.
He tested negative for rabies.
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Wait I have something else...
I think we can conclude, that our
Mr. Lucas spent the day getting shot,
being treated like a dog...
having to baby-sit...
and wishing he had spent
one more day in prison.
It's Lucas.
Hey, Rover.
How are you, pal?
Come on in!
All I can say is all charges against
Mr. Lucas have been dropped.
Now that you're a free man,
Mr. Lucas, what will you do?
Find a job, lead a normal
life like everyone else.
- How's it feel for a professional
like you to be taken hostage?
- Tell us about the kidnapper!
He's a nobody.
As far as I'm concerned,
I got nothing to say about him.
The matter's closed.
<i>Come on, Mr Lucas, give us a story!</i>
- What are you doing here?
- Sorry.
- Go on, move along.
- Sorry, excuse me.
Go on, get out of here.
I'm here to see Meg Perry, please.
- Relative?
- No, I'm a friend of the family.
- I have a Mr...
- Lucas.
Mr. Lucas here to see
the Perry girl. Okay.
Just a moment, please.
Who'd you call, the cop?
- Mr. Lucas?
- Yes.
Follow me.
Hello Meg. Look what
I brought you. You like it?
She refuses to talk and
she refuses to eat.
If she keeps this up much longer,
we're going to have to
feed her intravenously.
You hear that Meg?
If you don't eat pretty soon,
we'll have to stick a needle
in your arm and that will hurt.
Could I talk to her alone, please?
- You need authorization
from juvenile court...
- Look,
this kid needs a lot of things,
but one thing she doesn't need
is a cop guarding over her.
Five minutes.
Meg, look at me.
Meg.
Meg, you have to eat, you hear me?
Come on, be a good girl.
Look at me.
If you want, I'll visit you
every day, but look at me.
Look at me, for Christ sakes.
Okay, I'm leaving.
I'm going to go now, Meg.
I'm going to go.
Okay, good bye, Meg.
Do you remember when you said to me:
"Don't go"?
Speak to me again, Meg.
Tell me: "Don't go."
That'd make me so happy.
No? You don't want to?
Okay, don't talk, Meg, but eat.
Please, you're so thin.
Listen, I'll bring you a cake tomorrow.
Would you like that?
I'll keep you fed, the food
here is got to be lousy.
A great big cake with whipped cream
and everything on top.
What do you say?
A kiss good bye.
I'll leave him here with you.
And you take care of him,
like you took care of me.
Why don't you just ring the alarm,
I hope you haven't jammed it.
You scared me.
What are you doing here?
- Is that you that smells like fish?
- Do I?
- You stink.
- Could be, I slept in a fish net.
Oh, Jesus.
Please God, let her be okay.
Just let her be okay.
- I saw her yesterday.
- And?
- Not so good.
- What do you mean "not so good"?
- She'll be all right
once she's out of here.
- Just relax and let's do this right.
- Right, right. You're right.
- Locked?
- No problem.
Easy for you.
- There's a cop watching her.
- What?
- Your kid.
A female cop.
Complicates things.
Shit!
It must be that way.
- Stop that.
- I didn't do it on purpose.
Watch your step.
- What's with you?
- This place is a mess.
- Just wait for me here.
- No, no, no, no. I'm going with you!
It doesn't take two of us.
You stay here.
Don't be afraid. It's me, Lucas.
- We're out of here.
- Let me carry her.
Let's go.
This isn't mine. It's not
my daughter. You goofed.
- You gotta be kidding.
- I'm kidding?
It's because of that
damned monkey. Let's go.
I don't want this one,
I want mine.
Let's bet it. Hide.
But I want my daughter!
Hide!
Don't move!
Meg? Meg it's me! It's daddy!
Come here, Meg! Come on.
Where is she?
Put down the gun, Mr. Perry,
only makes things worse.
Tell me where she is
or I'm going to kill you.
She's in the infirmary. This way.
Move it! Move it!
You know... I'm going
to put you back in bed.
You be a good girl,
and don't scream. Okay?
Just don't scream.
You'll be guilty of kidnapping.
Do you know what
that's going to get you?
Ya, her.
<i>What...</i>
Meg? Meg? It's me.
Don't be afraid. It's daddy.
It's daddy, come on.
Let me out of here!
Stop! Take it easy!
You're trapped.
Just take it easy.
Quick!
Meg?
Meg?
Meg, come on baby.
Why won't she wake up?
Feel her hands, they're freezing.
We'll take care of her.
Don't worry.
- Where are we?
- Customer's house.
I put a security system in here.
They went on vacation this morning.
They won't be back for a month.
- Is something wrong?
- I don't know.
- Give her to me.
- No, I'm okay. I just... haven't eaten
that much lately or slept either.
Give her to me. You'll drop her.
No, it is my daughter.
I don't want anyone to take her.
Stand still. Stand still.
- Two are too heavy.
- No, I got you.
Okay, put her in the bed.
She's not going to die, is she?
You think she's going to die?
Why would she die?
Stop saying that shit, you'll jinx us.
- Asshole! Why would she die?
- I'm scared.
You're giving me the willies.
She's going to be okay. All right?
Meg, we're here now!
We're not in the home any more!
Your father's here and I'm here!
- Open your eyes, dammit!
- Stop it, you'll hurt her!
I'm hungry.
- She's hungry.
- He's hungry, for God's sakes!
Fruit! Get the fruit.
Plastic.
There's nothing to eat
in this stupid house!
What do you expect.
They're gone for a month.
Jerks!
- Maybe we should order a pizza.
- You do and it'll be
delivered by the FBI.
Here!
- Smoked oysters.
- Oh.
Goose liver.
Truffles.
What the hell is this?
- Caviar.
- Who are these people?
Rich.
Do little girls eat caviar?
- Look what we got you, Meg.
- Caviar! Yummy!
Meg?
- Maybe we should let her sleep?
- Ya.
Mmm. This is pretty good.
Ya, very good.
Ya, real good.
Here we go, nice and...
- Good morning, Meg.
- Hi.
Look what I brought you.
Now, I want you to eat everything,
you hear?
- Okay.
- All right.
Here, I had it made this morning.
Kowalski?
It's my new name.
I'm traveling with Ms. Kowalski
and our son Jonathan.
What?
They're looking for two men
and a little girl.
Perfect. Everything we need.
You don't really expect me to
dress up like a woman, do you?
I'm telling you, they're looking
for two guys and a little girl. Here.
Why can't we just stay here?
You said they'd be gone for a month.
Pal, we got the FBI, state police,
road blocks and Dugan on our ass.
We can't sit it out. Here.
I'll never pass for a woman.
There's nothing feminine about me.
Look at me, I'd be grotesque.
- Better to be grotesque than dead.
- I'm too ugly. I'll never pull it off!
Looks don't matter, there are ugly ladies.
I know there are ugly ladies.
There are a lot of ugly ladies.
- But I don't look like an ugly lady, okay?
- You will.
Now, do not worry. It'll grow back.
I look ridiculous.
Not only are they going to arrest us,
they're going to laugh themselves silly.
Let's see.
Won't get 10 feet dressed like this.
Even in a convention of transvestites,
I'd be arrested.
- Now, what's your name?
- Jonathan.
- What's my name?
- Daddy.
- And what's his name?
- Mommy.
Good!
Don't talk to me.
Put the wig on.
I thought...
look what he's done to your hair!
- It's okay, Mommy. It'll grow back.
- Don't call me mommy!
- No, do!
- Oh yeah, that's right, do.
- God, what a sight.
- No... it'll be fine.
I hope so.
Never felt more depressed in my life.
You look very pretty mommy.
I hate when she calls me mommy.
Let's hit the road, Lucille.
Lucille?
Can't leave it alone, can you?
Oh God.
- Did you tell her to hurry?
- Yes.
Come on, we gotta get going!
Are you doing okay?
I'm okay.
You know you have to fatten up.
You're too skinny.
I don't want a skinny kid.
Will you stay with us?
Where in hell is she, your father?
Lucille!
I'm coming! I'm coming!
You know, if fate
had been a little kinder to me...
- I would still be working
and leading a normal life.
- Let's go.
Instead, I'm married to a convict and
I have a daughter named Jonathan.
- Come on. Let's go!
- My shoe.
If we hit a roadblock, don't panic.
Let me handle it.
I won't panic. Do not worry.
I'm okay now. Going to be fine.
Let's just hope we don't get arrested.
I really don't want to
go to jail in this dress.
- My stomach.
- What?
I finished off the caviar
and oysters for breakfast.
I feel lousy.
- Cops.
- What?
Behind us. Cops.
Shit!
- If you're under the speed limit,
shouldn't be a problem.
- Good.
Stay calm.
- Gee, I don't feel well.
- What?
I think I'm getting car sick.
- Not now!
- Oh my God! Oh my God!
- Roll down the window get some fresh air.
- I'm going to throw up.
- Are you any better?
- No, I gotta vomit.
Stick your head out the window.
- My wig!
- Oh no! You major asshole!
You're the one that told me to
stick my head out the window!
- Here.
- Thank you.
- Better?
- Yes.
- Keep it.
- Thanks.
We have to find it.
I'll never get out of here like this.
No.
- Although, some women have short hair.
- Ya.
But not with that face.
You're too ugly. You look like shit.
Come on. We gotta find that wig.
We'll never find it.
- I don't think you get to say all that.
- All what?
About my appearance.
It wasn't really necessary.
You said I look like shit.
There it is!
- What's with the wig?
- Hum?
- Your wig!
It's a little too bouffant, isn't it.
- Why is it sticking up like that?
- How should I know?
Shit! A road block.
Okay, don't worry. Don't panic.
Remember, your name is Jonathan.
You're going to be okay.
Now listen, if they ask any questions...
- If they ask any questions, I'm screwed.
- No. Just answer in a women's voice.
How's this sound?
- Can you do it better?
- No, I can't do it better.
I told you I don't have a woman's voice.
They're definitely going
to arrest us for sure.
Go through it.
- What?
- Go through it!
Are you nuts? They'll shot us.
I told you I don't want them to
get my little girl! We can make it!
Fix your wig, darling!
I'm sorry to bother you,
may see your license, please.
We're in a hurry, my wife is pregnant.
She's not feeling too well.
She doesn't look so good.
You going to the County General?
Wait a minute. Larry, Marty, a young
lady here ready to give birth.
- Give them an escort.
- No, no, no. That's not really necessary.
It'll be safer. You won't have to
worry about the lights, traffic.
Good luck folks!
What do I do now? Give birth?
Let me think.
- I'd like to have a little brother.
- Well, don't count on it.
Give me your teddy bear, sweetheart.
This is going to be one
surprised obstetrician.
We radioed ahead.
They'll be bringing out a gurney.
Are you doing okay, little lady?
Don't be afraid, Mommy.
Why don't those jerks leave?
Everything's going to be fine, ma'am.
Just relax.
- Watch your step now.
- Here we go.
- No, no. I rather walk.
- Lie down, please.
Are you all right?
You didn't hurt yourself?
Up. There you go.
Doctor's waiting.
Stop!
I feel much better. Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.
She forgets everything.
- How do you feel?
- Delivered.
- What are you doing?
- Shortcut.
We'll be in Canada in ten minutes.
Here we are.
This is Canada baby,
so you can call me daddy again.
This is a friend of mine in Vancouver.
Call him. He'll help you out.
Wait. Here...
We'll figure this out later...
Well, take it all.
That ought to hold you.
I don't know what to say, Lucas.
Don't say anything.
Go on... change that to Canadian.
You need gas.
Get out of the car, baby.
Now, listen to me, Meg.
I can't stay with you.
Now, don't be sad.
I'll come visit.
Honest.
It'll be like we never were apart.
We'll have lots of fun,
the three of us.
Oh, please, Meg,
don't look at me like that.
I'm trying to start a new life.
Do you understand?
No.
I've been on the run too long.
I just can't take it any more.
- You see?
- No.
I'm gonna miss you.
I'll never forget you.
This bank is surrounded.
Come out with your hands up
and you will not get hurt.
I repeat, this bank is surrounded.
I have a hostage,
let me through or I'll kill him.
I have a hostage!
Maybe I better stay
with you guys a little longer.
