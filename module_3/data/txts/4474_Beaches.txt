I don't know.
18 down.
Maybe it's "bluffed"?
No...
It can't be "bluffed."
It's gotta be five...
I know.
I'm horrible at these.
You do it.
Come on, we can't give up.
Let's see.
You're relentless.
I'm just not a quitter.
Remember that time,
the first Christmas we had
in Hollywood,
when you kept forcing me
to sing Christmas Carols?
What kind of Christmas Carols
are you talking about?
Christmas Carols.
You have
such a vivid imagination, CC.
Imagination!
It is my memory, miss Whitney,
and my memory
is very, very long.
Like it or not.
Well...
I'm going
to depend on you for that.

Thank you!
Don't fear the hat!
Thank you in advance.
Here you go.
I'm CC.
I'm Hillary.
Hillary Whitney.
Well, well, well.
I really loved your singing.
Thanks.
I'm working on it.
You don't have to give me
a whole ten, though.
It's the thought that counts.
No way.
I have another anyway.
Well, well, well.
Stop doing that.
I'm guessing
you're not from here.
No, I'm just here till tomorrow.
You?
Come on, let's bolt.
I don't have a permit.
Can we "bolt" a bit faster?
What's the problem?
Is that your mom?
I wish.
That's my au pair.
Come on.
So, where's your mom?
Why'd she stick you
with the au pair on vacation?
She died two years ago.
Whoa.
Sorry.
It's okay.
I'm used to it, I guess.
I still have my dad.
Where is he?
In a meeting, probably.
He's a lawyer,
so he's very important,
he travels a lot.
Sometimes, I get to come along.
What does your dad do?
I dunno.
Never met him.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
I'm used to it, I guess.
CC!
I'm gonna kill you!
Oh, crap.
Over here, Leona!
Jesus, kid...
Look, I was working!
On your time,
you do whatever you want.
On my time,
you gotta watch the stand.
And wipe that mustard
off your face
before you talk
to the customers.
Does your boss always
yell like that?
That's not my boss,
that's my mother.
What do you want to find out?
You sell this stuff?
Yeah.
I like to ink of this place
as my "humble beginnings."
I'm gonna be
a famous singer someday.
You have an amazing voice.
Really?
You think so?
You're lucky.
I wish I knew what I wanted
to be when I grow up.
Well, enjoy it while it lasts.
When you know what
you wanna be when you grow up,
you have to start working.
My dad says I have
to be a lawyer like him.
Where do you live, anyway?
Outside San Francisco.
Oakland hills.
That's not that bad.
At least
we're in the same state.
I was scared
you lived in, like,
Connecticut or something.
I leave for boarding school
in Connecticut in September.
No!
There.
Promise you'll write?
For sure.
I'd be bummed
if we never talked again.
You're the best person
I've ever met.
That's the best thing
anyone's ever said to me.
Hillary Ann Whitney!
Explain yourself!
I did not come to venice
to spend my time
chasing you down.
I came here for work!
Am I at work right now?
No, sir.
I almost called the police.
I'm sorry, daddy.
I lost track of time.
I met a new friend.
CC bloom.
Nice to meet you.
Come on, Hillary.
Bye, CC!
Bye for now, Hillary Whitney.

And my purse, and my phone?
Did you hear that crowd?
It was amazing,
it was like, "ahh!"
"CC! CC!"
I mean, I never heard a crowd
like that before.
Livin' the dream...
What?
Oh, my god!
- Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
- Hi!
That's the creepiest thing
you've ever done!
I know! I'm...
Hi!
You are so amazing!
Really?
Yes! I forgot
how beautiful your voice is,
and to see you on stage?
Oh, come on, I sing for you
on the phone all the time.
What are you doing here?
Are you on vacation?
Oh, no.
What did you do?
I don't know.
I was feeling...
I was feeling trapped,
and I was feeling suffocated,
so I just... I left.
Okay, start from the beginning,
what happened?
Nothing!
Nothing happened.
I was in my office,
I was closing out
a couple of cases,
and I just felt like
I was going through the motions,
and I just left.
I wasn't happy
doing that work anymore.
What did your father say?
I don't know,
I'm scared to check
my voicemail.
CC, here you go.
Get your drink.
Congratulations,
Hillary Whitney.
Everyone deserves
a nervous breakdown.
I have a couch
with your name on it.
Oh, god...
Okay.
Uh...
Okay. This...
Is the living room.
This could be your room.
You know...
Don't turn on the oven,
I keep my sweaters in there.
Bathroom...
Watch when you stand naked
in front of the window,
'cause people can see in there.
I learned that the hard way.
Okay...
Central air...
Even got a balcony...
Where you can see
the Hollywood sign.
So...?
What do you think?
Hey...
I know it's not that much,
and-and...
I can get a screen for privacy,
and I won't leave
as much stuff on the floor.
It's perfect.
I love it.
It's so you.

Which one's yours?
Oh, no, I don't have
any children.
I work with Rachel's father.
Or have worked with him.
I'm a director.
Oh.
Cool.
The hawk?
Wait,
you did that four-person thing,
with the...
The rock opera about
the revolutionary war...
- with all the mirrors, yes.
With the mirrors!
You saw it?
Yeah!
I mean, well, I-i ushered.
Free tickets.
Had I known one of our ushers
could sing like that,
I would have insisted
you get up on stage.
Well, that can be arranged.
Well, maybe you should come
try out for the next one?
We're holding auditions.
Give me a call.
- Whoa, seriously?
- Seriously.
CC!
Hi! I know you wanted me
to get you at 4:30,
but I was looking for you,
I couldn't find you.
I can't see
the cars from here...
Hi.
Oh, hi.
Um, you know, we should
probably get going,
because the traffic
is really bad.
Are you late for an audition?
You must be an actress.
Me?
No, I'm not an actress,
I'm a lawyer.
A lawyer? Wow.
You almost never meet anyone
other than actors in L.A.
Uh... are you
a divorce lawyer?
Because you could probably
make a killing in here.
No, I do a lot of pro bono work.
Oh.
Yeah.
We should be going.
- Okay...
- I'm John.
Oh, I'm so sorry,
where are my manners?
I'm Hillary.
Hillary.
Nice to meet you, John.
Nice to meet you.
Oh, my voice sounds
so much better
when I'm not singing in Yiddish.
Well, I look forward
to hearing that.
No, I look forward
to you hearing that.
I'm going to remember this
for the rest of my life.
What?
You. Me.
Folding laundry.
Us...
Everything.
I mean it, I will...
Okay, okay,
that's really sweet, CC,
but you need
to actually be folding.
I am folding.
You should call him.
Huh? Call who?
John Pierce?
213...
- Director...
- Is this yours?
You know you don't have
to wait for him to call you.
That's typically how it works
after you audition for someone.
Oh, I'm sorry,
I didn't realize
it was strictly business.
Exactly, just bring down
into your body a little more
and see how that feels,
all right?
- Okay, I can do that.
- All right.
Thanks.
Herr direktor...
I'm under-studying
the henchmen.
- And the mayor.
- And the mayor.
You're in the ensemble.
Well, I thought
you liked my voice.
I do.
Come on, CC,
let's sing another one.
No way.
I sang all those
Dreidel songs with you.
You can sing another one
with me...
There's only one Dreidel song.
Goodnight, Hillary.

"it would be a crime

take a hint, and, you know,
get my real estate license
or something.
I think you should keep going.
Are you sure?
Yes, I've told you that
a zillion times.
I know, but maybe
you're just being nice,
how should I know?
Maybe you have to say that
because you're my best friend.
No, I've said it before,

You were amazing.
I don't like to read

Hang on, hang on, listen.

"a 120-minute

Our lovely CC...
What's it gonna say?
"CC bloom shines at its center
"with a voice almost
too big for the stage,
we're lucky
to have her on."
It's a rave.
"The daily," too.
I got "time out."
And "the reporter."
Okay, don't read anymore...
So proud of you.
A toast...
To the right group of people
at just the right time.
Yes.
Cheers!
M'wah. Thank you.
Thank you, CC.
Oh, I'm so relieved...
She was amazing.
She's a star.
You know, I just
can't shake the feeling
that I know you
better than I do.
Really?
I kinda feel the same way.
Because I talk about
you both constantly!
Oh, thank you.
Aw...
- Hey!
- Hey, look at that!
She took my drink.
Maybe I should get another one.
She did take your glass.
- I'm fine with that...
- Here's your jacket.
- Thank you so much.
- No problem at all.
It's right over here...
Good morning.
You scared me.
You're home early.
Or late.
Depending on how you look at it.
Sorry.
Did you sleep with him?
Yes.
So, are you in love now?
I don't know.
I-I don't know.
I mean, I...
I like him.
Oh, yeah, I know how you feel.
Sorry, CC.
[Breathing deeply
it's complicated.
It's complicated,
but you did it anyway.
You've been working
with this guy for weeks,
and you haven't
mentioned anything.
I thought that
you were over him.
It's not that easy for me.
I'm not like you.
Well, what is that
supposed to mean?
It means that
you just roll out of bed,
and life falls into place
for you.
I have to work at everything.
At my looks, at my talent.
I work so hard
just to be noticed!
And you just stroll in,
and-and...
I don't understand
how someone with such a big ego
can be so insecure!
Oh, so we're moving
into the insult part
of the injury now, is that it?
No, I just wish
that you would show up
for your life
the way that you show up
for your career.
Well, some rejections
are not as easy as others.
But you didn't try!
I was the one who told you
to call him!
I am not
a mind-reader!
I didn't know that you were
waiting in the wings
to swoop on in.
I knew that I had
missed my chance,
I knew I was messing it up,
but not to you!
You of all people, you were
supposed to have my back.
You're supposed to be...
Just forget it.
I won't see him anymore.
Who are you kidding?
No, I won't!
I won't see him anymore.
So...
What are we gonna do?
I don't know.
Well, do you hate me?
Yes.
No.
Not really.
Do you want me to move out?
No.
Can I use this towel?
Yeah, sure, whatever you want.
Oh, shut up.
I was sad.
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>
<i>I'm sorry I left in such a rush.</i>
<i>Dad is doing okay,</i>
<i>but during surgery,
they found a tumor.</i>
<i>It's bad.</i>
<i>I'm so not ready for this, CC.</i>
<i>What's-his-face is here.</i>
<i>He still works for the firm.</i>
<i>It's actually been nice
having him around.</i>
<i>I miss you.</i>
<i>How's the show going?</i>
<i>I promise I'll come back to L.A.</i>
<i>As soon as things
settle down here.</i>
<i>Call me, no matter what time.</i>
<i>The show is going great.</i>
<i>I'm gonna sing on Leno!</i>
<i>Yeah, the actual tonight show!</i>
<i>Can you believe it?</i>
<i>The world
suddenly feels huge, hill.</i>
<i>I really wish
I could get up there, though.</i>
<i>But between the play
and the auditions,</i>
<i>and I'm fighting a cold.</i>
<i>Ugh, I thought I could catch you
before I go on vocal rest.</i>
<i>Text when you get this.
Please?</i>
<i>P.S. I forgot what's-his-face's
actual name. Is that bad?</i>
<i>I missed you again!</i>
<i>Ugh, I can't tell if your phone
is off or just full.</i>
<i>His name is Bryan. With a "y".</i>
<i>Don't even start.</i>
<i>Oh, and I've watched
your Leno performance 10 times!</i>
<i>Everyone was great,
but you were the best!</i>
<i>You were amazing, CC!</i>
<i>Hey, by the way, how's John?</i>
<i>Do you see him?</i>
<i>I mean, other than
at the theater?</i>
<i>I got cast in a pilot,</i>
<i>shoots next week.</i>
<i>I'll stay in the play</i>
<i>until I know if it's going
to series or not.</i>
<i>It's a sitcom
set in a catholic school,</i>
<i>and I play a nun.</i>
<i>Huh, I must be
a terrific actor, right?</i>
<i>Call me.</i>
Get off, you just...
Oh, no...
You know what,
you should've went for the...
Just stop it, I'm serious.
Hi, daddy.
Hi.
Hey...
Hey, you look good.
How you feeling?
Listen...
I want you to take over
the Grady case,
come back to the firm
full-time.
Can you do that for me?
Of course.
So, any word from Hillary?
Her father's still in hospice.
Could be days, could be weeks.
But she's back together
with what's-his-face again,
so...
At least she's not alone.
I'm happy someone's there
to take care of her.
Yeah. Good.
Hey, Leona is coming
to the show tonight.
She goes home
first thing in the morning,
so you're spared
any real interaction.
Well, we'll take her
for drinks tonight,
and I'll tell her what
a talented daughter she has.
Before I lose you to Hollywood
once and for all.
Oh, come on, babe,
what's good for me
is good for both of us, right?
We'll see.
<i>Enough about me...</i>
Blah, blah, blah. So..?
<i>So...</i>
Bryan and I
are officially married,
it seems crazy, but...
We did it.
<i>Very crazy!</i>
Yeah.
I know.
It was so nice
to have daddy here.
He was so proud, and...
I can't imagine
getting married without him.
So, how was the ceremony?
<i>It was perfect.</i>
The only thing missing was you,
but I understand,
you have to work,
and the show must go on.
Thank you for the gift.
<i>Was it the one you wanted?</i>
The one?
The what, the...
Uh, do you mean... you mean
the salt and pepper shakers?
The... yeah, right,
the salt and pepper shakers.
Yeah, was it the pair
that you wanted?
Yes.
They're perfect.
Oh, god,
uh, they're calling me to set.
Um...
Hillary, I'm so happy for you.
I'm so sorry I wasn't there.
The a.D. Said
that he would get me out,
<i>and then he rescheduled
at the last second.</i>
It's okay, I understand.
Okay, make sure you tell Bryan
I said congratulations...
What's-his-face!
<i>I can't believe it.</i>
I will do.
Okay, I love you.
Bye.
I love you, too, CC.
Did you really
buy my best friend
salt and pepper shakers
for her wedding?
I said I wanted something nice.

Thank you all for being...
Such an important piece
and part of his journey.
CC, it's the night
of your big premiere,
how do you feel?
CC! CC!

CC! Over here, CC!
Wonderful, wonderful,
good job...
Don't worry, baby,
we'll catch her after.
<i>You think
just because I'm a nun,</i>
<i>I don't feel what you feel?</i>
<i>Maybe you didn't stop
being a person,</i>
<i>but you certainly
fancy yourself a Saint.</i>
<i>Would a Saint do this?</i>
Well, I must say
the house is beautiful.
It took forever to find,
but it's totally worth it.
I finally feel like an adult,
you know?
Yeah, well,
I did love our place.
I loved it, too,
but it was barely an apartment.
We lived in a glorified
storage unit with a terrace.
Yes.
So, are you still singing?
Uh, well, yeah,
here and there,
when I have time.
I have to watch my voice,
contractually,
because the show
is very demanding.
Are you still...
Hi! You're home early.
Well, we can't run
act three with Mickey,
and she's still out with a cold,
hi.
Hillary.
How are you?
I haven't seen you for so long.
It's so nice to see you.
It's great to see you, too.
John, this is Bryan.
Hillary's husband.
- Uh, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
I'm, um...
I'm CC's, uh...
I'm CC's.
Isn't he cute?
So, what are you
up to these days?
We're doing an all-female
1776 musical.
Yeah, we go up next month.
That's amazing.
It's so nice that
you continue to do inspiring
and interesting art.
So, who's playing Ben Franklin?
Oh, honey...
An intern, actually.
The wig was a tough sell.
Yeah, I bet.
Well, the truth is, it was, uh,
it was quite a change,
a lot of hours,
but worth it.
To be partner would mean
that I would leave a legacy.
Like Mr. Whitney.
Yes,
and I can't wait to see
his name on that door.
He's certainly earned it.
And what about you, hill?
What about me?
Are you betting back
to your advocate work?
No.
Not right now.
Oh, believe me,
she is doing much bigger
things at the firm.
Well, that's
a matter of opinion.
CC...
No, it's okay.
I sit at my dad's desk.
My pro-bono work
will just have to...
Wait for now.
Things change.
Okay.
Things change.
Well, cheers, guys.
Cheers.
Well, I'm glad we could do this.
Me too.
You guys talking about babies?
Yeah, well,
we're not really trying yet,
but we will soon.
That's great.
Thanks.
You're not going to ask
if we're talking about it?
You and John?
Why do you say it like that?
I'm sorry, I'm just surprised.
Why would that surprise you?
Well, you're so obsessed
with your career,
you don't strike me
as the type of person
that would want to give that up.
Well, I don't think
I'd have to "give that up."
Just because
you give up on things...
I haven't given up anything.
Who are you right now?
I just, I don't
recognize you anymore.
We've grown apart.
It happens.
We've lasted longer than most,
but now this is over.
What's over?
This.
Us.
We haven't grown apart,
you're falling apart.
You've been spiraling
ever since your dad got sick.
How would you know?
All you did was send flowers!
I had to shoot.
And that wedding gift,
did you even send it yourself?
Yes!
What, am I on trial here?
The two most important
days of my life,
and you were
nowhere to be found.
You're the one who left!
I'm not doing this.
You said you were coming back,
and you never did.
You just picked up
where you left off
over there
like none of this
actually happened,
like I was just
some intermission
from your real life...
Real life?
What do you know
about "real life"?
You live in some fantasy
where everything is about you!
Well, at least I let it
be about me.
I don't go from one
domineering man to another.
Let's not forget
about the domineering woman
in between.
Stop acting like you have
no say in anything.
Well, stop acting like
such a goddamn bully!
I'm not bullying you,
I'm challenging you!
Oh, you're challenging me?
You're so egotistical!
You're jealous because
I'm doing what I set out to do.
Jealous?
Jealous of what?
Your blinding ambition?
Your paralyzing
need for attention?
Or your relationship
of convenience?
My what?
My what!
You got him by default,
and you know it.
Well, at least
I belong to myself.
I'm living the life
you wanted to live,
tried to live,
but didn't have the guts.
I'd be jealous
if I were you, too.
I just wouldn't be
such a bitch about it.
Those look nice.
Thank you, honey.
Are you sure?
I am.
I don't get a say in any of it?
Your whole life
is a say in this.
I resent being punished
because I'm suCCessful.
I'm not punishing you, Ceec',
I'm proud of you.
I just don't belong here.
We have been fighting about this
for so long.
I don't understand, what is it?
What is so wrong with suCCess?
What's important to you
isn't important to me,
and that's okay,
because yours is bigger.
I just don't want to be
in the shadow of it.
You know what,
if the roles were reversed,
and I was okay with being
in your shadow,
it would make me a good partner,
and make me a good wife!
I don't want to be your wife.
And you don't want to be
my partner either.
So, that's it?
Love doesn't factor
into any of it?
Ceec'...
Love absolutely factors into it.
That's why I want to let us go
before "us" goes bad.
I want to keep loving you.
Even if it's from afar.
Yeah.
Loving you at a distance
is better than...
Resenting you in this room.
<i>I know this is wrong,</i>
<i>but it can't be goodbye...</i>
I think it has to be.
You're a nun and I'm married.
Where does your wife
think you are?
Church.
Clementine!
Cut!
That's a wrap on episode 8.
Hey, CC?
Walter wants to see you
in the office.
Walter does?
Yup.
CC bloom for Carin, please.
You knew
they were writing me off,
and you didn't say anything?
Yeah. Just now, today.
We can't just let the...
Oh.
Well...
When?
When did they say that?
I'm not that distracted.
No, my heart is in it.
Okay, you know what,
let's just...
What's done is done.
No, I don't-i don't want to see
the silver lining, okay?
I just...
I just need a week.
I'll call you in a week, okay?
Thanks.
Bye.
What are you doing?
My mother loved coming here.
It's so peaceful.
I wish we could spend
more time here.
Yeah.
Just feel so much more
connected, you know?
Yeah, me too, baby.
Hmm.
I'm ready to have a baby.
Hey, I...
Whoa, whoa,
I-i thought we decided
that, uh, now wasn't the time?
I don't think we're there.
I'm not there.
What do I need to do
to help you get there?
Baby, I...
I need time.
Okay.
You know, I...
You know, I don't even
think I'm cut out for it.
Anyways, you know, I want to...
I want to focus
on the firm right now.
You know that.
You know the job,
and you saw how hard
your father worked, right?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah. Okay.
Look, I should, uh,
I should get going
if I want to beat that traffic.
<i>Hey, it's Bryan.
Leave a message.</i>
<i>Hey, hon', it's me,</i>
<i>just thinking about you.</i>
<i>I hope you made it home safely.</i>
Hillary, uh...
There's nothing you can say.
I want you to leave...
And I don't ever want
to see your face again.
You're disgusting.

Could we tape in the bridge?
Can you give us
a second, please?
Thanks.
What are you doing here?
I went to your place,
you weren't there.
I gave your housekeeper 50 bucks
to tell me where you were.
Well, she's fired.
Is now a bad time?
I'm not talking first.
I don't know what to say.
Okay, well,
I have work to do, so...
Well, you sound great.
Look, I'm sorry
I didn't return your calls,
but the more time passed,
the easier it was not to call.
Well, it got harder for me.
Every day that went by
got harder than the one
before it, so...
I'm sorry it was easier
and easier for you,
but that's not how I felt.
I didn't mean it like that.
I'm sorry for everything, okay?
I don't know what happened.
I don't even know
why I was angry with you
for so long,
but it doesn't matter anymore.
What matters...
What matters is I forgive you,
and I just wanted you
to know that.
Oh, you forgive me?
You took your friendship away
without even
talking to me about it!
Or yelling at me about it!
It meant everything to me.
I trusted in it.
I believed in it.
But you didn't,
and now it's gone.
So, thank you for forgiving me,
but I don't forgive you.
You were right.
I was jealous,
and I hated myself for it.
But you know who you are.
You are confident,
you're strong, you're talented,
and I couldn't compete
with that.
You are smart,
and you're beautiful,
and you do everything well,
and people look at you.
It's my fault.
No, don't be silly,
it was our fault.
And I'm sorry.
- Pregnant!
- Yes.
But I don't find out
until after he leaves.
You're having a baby? Shit!
I'm having a baby,
and he wants
nothing to do with it.
He didn't want kids,
or at least not with me.
Maybe with her, but not with me.
Who?
His girlfriend!
Well, now I think
she's his fiance, but...
He signed over
all of his parental rights
so he could move to Boston
and start a life with her.
Okay, wait,
you catch what's-his-face
with another woman,
and now you're having
his baby by yourself?
That's amazing.
It is?
Yes!
Oh, that is the scariest,
most beautiful thing
I've ever heard of!
You are amazing,
Hillary Whitney!
Brave and amazing.
I'm not.
Not all strength is loud, hill.
Oh, god. Thanks, CC.
Well, you can hire people
to do this for you, you know.
I understand that,
but you know what,
I think this is gonna be fun,
if you just cooperate.
Where's the wrenchy thing?
You know, the "universal tool"?
I don't think
you need that for this.
All we have to do
is put the "skulb"
into the "rahol".
Ooh, that's what she said.
Which sounds crazy.
I don't understand
why the English instructions
are in Swedish.
Oh, god, I can't take it,
I'm gonna get a drink.
I'll drink yours, too,
don't worry.
Don't come back drunk, 'cause
we have lots of work to do.
Did you know if I get drunk,
I can talk Swedish?
Is that an alien or a squid?
Oh, stop it.
Don't you see that
big head right there?
She looks smart already.
Aw, I know, it's amazing.
I wanna feel...
I mean, can I?
Of course, you can.
Here, let's find the head.
Give me your hand.
It's over here.
Can you feel it?
Oh, my god, that was it?
- I know, she's moving...
- That was her!
She's totally moving.
Oh, my god, oh, my god.
Ah! That's so...
Don't scare her!
You're screaming!
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
Okay, I just got a call
from my agent.
They want me back.
At "pretty sinners"
well, that's great.
What about your album?
It's just a guest spot,
three episodes.
Good.
Apparently, I have, like,
a big "Internet presence"
or something.
CC, that's great.
Why are you looking like that?
Because I have to be in L.A.,
like, now,
and I don't know what to do.
What do you mean
you don't know what to do?
You're gonna take the job.
That's great.
I've got, like, 10 more weeks
before this happens.
We're good, just...
Promise me you'll be there
for the birth.
I would never miss that.
Really?
Never, ever.
Ever, ever.
Okay.
I believe you.
I mean, you know,
time is not really your thing,
but I believe you.
Okay.
So has the director tried
to sleep with you yet?
I'm not really into chicks.
Oh, you will be.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god, it's happening.
Why do you have a pager?
I don't have the time
or the crayons
to explain this to you.
I have to go.
I have to go!
Uh, just kill me off again
if you have to!
CC, what the hell?
Keep breathing,
good, good, good.
Yeah...
I'm trying to stay calm.
You're doing,
you're doing good...
Jesus, there you are.
There you are!
Why do you always do this to me?
You are always late.
- I am not...
- For every single thing...
You're, like, a week late!
That's later than...
For every single thing,
you're always late.
Don't you remember
that time in the restaurant
when you left me
in the lobby that entire time?
And I waited for you
and I waited...
Why do you always bring that up?
'Cause, because!
I was getting a manicure,
and the lady next to me,
she stole my bag,
and I had no keys,
and no phone, and no money...
Do you believe this?
This is my best friend,
and she's always late!
She needs...
She needs quiet.
Is she okay? Why isn't
anyone doing anything?
There's nothing to do
except have a baby.
Nothing to do?
Yes, there's nothing to do.
I think I'm ready to push.
Okay.
- Okay, I'm ready to push.
- Okay.
Get down there.
Am I dilated?
Is it time?
I don't know, but I hope
you went to the bathroom...
- You're good.
- Oh, god...
Ready?
One, two, three...
Oh, hi! Oh, hi!
Oh, yes...
Oh, I know....
I know, a lotta gas...
- It's all so new...
- Yeah...
She's magical.
Oh, my god...
Victoria Cecelia Whitney.
Thank you for that.
I love you.
I love you.
Tory Cecelia Whitney,
what are you up to?
I'm trying to see
if this one should go here,
or if it should go here.
How about there?
Check.
No, don't beat yourself up,
you just
have to keep practicing.
It takes time
to learn this game.
It's time for bed.
The sooner I go to bed,
the sooner it's morning,
the sooner school's out.
It can't be that bad, is it?
You only have three weeks left.
Summer is better.
I know what you mean.
Mommy's exhausted.
I'm eggs-zosted, too.
Well, good!
Because it's time...
For you to go to bed!
Love you.
I love you, too, baby.
You're perfect.
Dream big and broad,
and...?
And wide and beautiful!
That's right.
Good night.
Good night!

Mommy is tired.
You're always tired.
Now, please, go get ready.
We're late.
Hillary?
Hillary...
Yes?
The social worker
and the advocate are upstairs.
Oh great.
Um, do you think
we can get a room?
'Cause I'd love to go over
a couple things.
We're in session
in less than 10 minutes.
Right.
Okay. I'll be...
I'll be ready.
Okay.

Okay, uh,
tell frank to get the car.
Frank, we need CC's car!
I'm sorry, guys,
I-i gotta go.
Here's your bag.
Should just be right down there.
Hillary Whitney's room, please?
CC! CC!
Well, what was she admitted for?
- Well, is she...
- I love you, CC!
You can't tell me how she is?
You called me, remember?
Okay, well, can you at least
tell me if somebody is with her?
You know what,
if I find out she's alone,
I'm going to kill you,
and then I'm gong to sue you.
And I'm never
gonna stop calling.
Ever.
I love you, CC!
I'm sorry, what's your name?
Yes, thank you, I will hold.
Come on, let's go.
CC! I love you!
Go.
Hillary Whitney, please.
They said she was up here.
- Are you family?
- Yes.
I'm CC?
You called me?
She's right in there.
Hill?
You're here.
Thank you.
Okay, so...
Cardiomyopathy.
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
Well, what can...
What are we gonna do about it?
Medication and rest.
I mean it.
No exertion,
no strenuous activity
or situations.
Yeah, but what are we gonna do?
This doesn't sound like
a very aggressive approach.
It's not.
Hillary...
We've placed Ms. Whitney
on a donor list...
And...?
Unfortunately, Ms. Whitney
has type-o blood,
which aCCounts for
less than 5% of donors.
It's a waiting game,
and given
the advanced progression
of her condition,
I believe it's unlikely
we find an appropriate match.
So I'm treating her aCCordingly.
I'm sorry
if this is overwhelming.
Now...
I-I don't think
you're aware of this, but...
I'm very rich,
I can buy a heart.
CC...
It's the same disease
my mother had.
Same age.
Same blood type.
I'll give you two some time.
Let us know
if you need anything.
Hillary, "unlikely"
doesn't mean shit.
We're not giving up.
There's nothing to give up.
It is what it is.
No,
we haven't even gotten
a second opinion.
She is the second opinion.
We'll get a third opinion,
for god's sakes!
CC...
Not all strength is loud.
I want to take Tory
to the beach house.
I can't be alone.
I know you're touring...
I'll be there,
for however long you need.
Okay?
Let me just go
make some calls...
Yeah.
And I'll be right back.
Okay.
I'm coming right back.
You made it.
You made it...
You have no faith in me.
CC?
Tory!
Hey!
Hey, babe!
What are you doing here?
Where's mom?
She's right in there.
Don't worry,
we get to bring her
home tomorrow.
You know what?
Give me your backpack
and go say hi.
She can't wait to see you.
Thank you, baby.
Whew!
I think that's the last of it.
That doesn't go there.
This is gonna be a long summer.
You don't have to stay
the whole time,
if you don't want to.
Mom!
Yes!
What is it, Tory?
CC left her towel on the floor.
Okay, well, pick it up.
Whenever I leave anything
lying around,
you make me pick it up myself.
I know, Tory, but she's a guest.
I haven't cooked
in a long time, okay?
I see.
It's not that bad.
Okay.
It's really bad.
You want to just make sure
you have three sections, okay?
Okay, I got it.
Sorry, honey.
There you go.
Okay, one, two, three.
This is not gonna look
as good as mommy's.
Ow!
Sorry,
I just couldn't resist that.
One...
Two...
Two, two, two...
One...
Two!
I'm not so good
at that game anymore,
I guess.
We have the same hands.
We do, don't we, sweetie?
Come...
Hill, it's 3:00
in the morning.
What are you doing, honey?
I'm trying to find a picture
of my mother's hands.
I don't remember
what they look like.
Okay, we're going to find it.
Because I was looking
for the picture, and I...
Look, I found her pearls...
CC, I'm really scared.
I'm scared...
We're gonna find it.
I have this picture
of her hands, you know?
And I've had it
since I was a little girl,
and I was trying to find it,
and I couldn't.
I know that I saved the picture
because I was saving
the picture for Tory.
I'm just trying
to find the picture,
because I know that I have it...
I can't find it...
Look at her...
Is that it?
Thank you.
Oh, my god, yay!
Oh, let me try to do it.
Wait, I can do it, watch.
Oh, my god,
I'm never going to be
able to walk again.
Hey...
You wanna go to the pier?
We're going to the market later.
You know I can't walk that far.
Well, I can drive.
No.
Thank you.
Well, come outside,
'cause we're gonna test
the kite,
and it's...
Oh, it's so gorgeous out.
I'm fine where I am, CC.
Look, hill,
I know this is hard...
You don't know shit.
You don't know what it's like
being trapped in a body
that's failing you,
watching my baby go to you
instead of me
when she needs something,
because you have energy,
and you have life...
You told me to go play with her.
I know what I told you,
but I didn't know
I was gonna be this upset.
I didn't know it was gonna...
I didn't know it was gonna hurt.
Finally, I find the one thing
that I'm good at,
the one thing...
That brings me peace...
And I can't even do the job.
I'm not gonna be there
to watch my little girl grow up.
To teach her how to drive,
to take her to college.
Don't talk like that.
It's the truth.
Don't tell me
not to talk like this,
because this is my truth.
Fine.
You wanna talk truth?
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
You're dying?
Yeah.
It sucks? Yeah.
It's actually
the worst possible thing
I could ever have imagined.
But please,
stop acting like
you're dead already.
Right now, today,
you are still a beautiful
little girl's mother!
Look at this match.
Isn't it perfect
to go with my...
It, like, goes...
Oh, my gosh.
It goes.
Would you die?
Do you die?
Did you know that
I used to sell these?
Really?
In Venice? Yeah, when I was
a little girl, with my mom.
Yeah, so...
Hey, that one's totally mine.
Hey, this is mine,
and you can't make me
give it to you.
I will steal from a child.
You can't make me
give anything to you.
Hey...
Hi, mommy!
What are you up to?
CC's teaching me aCCessories.
Nice.
I like that blue one.
Get in line.
What do you mean, "get in line"?
That's our favorite, too.
Here, you want to make one?
I do.
So, you take
at least one string,
and you find a color...
imagination?
It is my memory, miss Whitney.
And my memory
is very, very long.
Like it or not.
Well...
I'm gonna depend on you
for that.
It's "foxed."
Hmm?
Right here,
18 down.
"Foxed."
I've still got it.
You don't have to show it to me,
I believe you.
I want you to see the proof.
Want to know
the most magic thing
about being a mommy?
What?
I'm always with you.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
Do you remember that time
when you were taking
swim lessons,
and you were so afraid
to get in the deep end,
and then, all of a sudden,
you got this courage,
and you jumped in there?
Remember that?
Yeah.
Well, I was there.
And do you remember the time
you broke your arm,
and you didn't even cry
one tear?
Yeah, not one tear.
That's because I was there.
So moms can go invisible?
It's not that
I'm really invisible,
it's just that
I am right here with you,
and you live right here in me,
no matter what.
No matter what.
And there's nothing and no one
that can change that.
I'm gonna be in here
when you're 995 years old.
And you know your aunt CC
loves you, yeah?
Yeah?
You know, she's been
my best friend
ever since we were kids?
Really?
Mm-hmm.
We met on the beach.
She knows every single thing
about your mommy.
She knows the good stuff
and the bad stuff.
And she knows...
She knows all my stories.
You have stories?
You know I have stories.
Yes, we all have a story.
Maybe one day,
she'll share it with you.
Hillary?
Hill?
Hillary!
Hillary...
Hillary! Hillary...
You fainted, honey.
I was just...
Trying to get...
Water.
That's okay...
No, no, no, no.
I just...
I just wanted some wa...
Water...
Okay, I need
to take you to the E.R.
You fainted.
No... no.
Hillary, I'm taking you
to the hospital.
No, I wanna be... here...
With you...
You...
Are you sure?
I'm sure.
Okay.
Hi.
Thank you.
Welcome.
What?
I want you to take Tory.
Hillary...
No, CC,
before you say anything,
just please listen to me.
I've thought about all of this.
I've thought about everything.
I know what I love about you,
I know what I hate about you.
I know everything about you.
You're my friend.
I want you to take Tory.
I'm...
You're gonna be great.
Look at me.
You're gonna be great.
Eventually.
You can do this.
Of course.
I put it in my will.
Will you sleep with me tonight?

No.
I understand if you don't...
You don't want
to come live with me.
I don't know what kind

I'm selfish,

I don't know

Not that I don't want you

I do,
more than anything.
I love you,
very much.
CC?
Yeah?
If I come live with you,
are you gonna change your mind?
No way.
Are you kidding?
Cross my heart.
I promise you.
Your mom was stuck with me
for 30 years.
Now you're gonna be
stuck with me, too.
Okay.
I'll come live with you.

All right, so,
what did you think?
How did I do tonight?
You did amazing.
Really?
You look like miss America.
Wow.
That's a compliment.
I like your skirt.
Did you take it from my closet?
Maybe.
Maybe not.
Did you know
that the song that
I closed with tonight
was the first song
I ever sang to your mom?
I was singing it to her
when we met.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
We weren't that much
older than you, really.
Did you know that?
Yeah.
We were, um,
we were in Venice beach,
and your mom was trying
to hide from her "au pair,"
which, um, you know, is
kind of like a fancy word
for "nanny," I guess.
My mom was hiding
from her nanny?
Yeah! And her dad.
She was so much more adventurous
than she ever
gave herself credit for.
And what were you doing?
Well, I was street
performing, of course.
But I was trying
to be sneaky about it,
because it's not exactly legal,
and they'd already picked me up
earlier that week.
Whoa...
Yeah, and then,
when I finished
the song, she said...
<i>You have an amazing voice.</i>
<i>Really?</i>
<i>I'd be bummed
if we never talked again.</i>
<i>You're the best person
I've ever met.</i>
<i>That's the best thing
anyone's ever said to me.</i>
<i>Bye, CC!</i>
<i>Bye for now, Hillary Whitney!</i>
