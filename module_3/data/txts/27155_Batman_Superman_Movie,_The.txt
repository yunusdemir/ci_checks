- Hang on there, Clyde.
- Sorry, Miss, we're closed.
Just look at what I'm selling
You'll plotz!
Good work, Harley girl.
Now, what would be a suitable
trade for our joke-in-a-box?
For some reason this
just speaks to me.
What do you think, Harl?
It's you, Puddin'.
Awfully nice doing business
with you, ta.
What a pleasant fellow.
It's weird. All this junk and
the Joker only takes
one lousy statue.
Especially since word
on the street says
he's desperate for cash
these days.
Things are never what
they seem with the Joker.
I guess the night brings out
all the wackos.
It was made of Jade.
Worth maybe a hundred grand.
I'd like a closer look.
Hey, he can't leave a
crime scene with evidence.
You wanna stop him?
Be my guest.
According to this
the laughing dragon has earned
quite a foreboding reputation.
Ever since it was carved
in China nearly 30 years ago,
it has passed through
several owners.
All of them
died prematurely.
And I can tell you why.
This so called Jade is
emitting low level radiation.
Alfred, isn't Bruce Wayne about
due for a trip to Metropolis?
Yes, but do you think,
this is an appropriate time?
I'd say the timing
couldn't be better.
Ladies and gentleman
of the press,
if you stay calm,
you may actually live
to write about this.
- Is the president secured?
- Copy.
We've already informed him
about change in flight plans.
Let's make an example
of this hero.
A very tragic example
I'm afraid, Miss...?
- Lane.
- Lane? Lois Lane?
- The one, Superman always saves?
- Afraid so.
Thanks for strapping me in.
Happy, I could help out,
Mr. President.
I hope, I didn't shake you
and the others up too badly.
I hate to say:
I've gotten used to it.
Um, Superman.
Yes?
Am, how could I put this?
I was just thinking...
It would be nice to see
each other when I wasn't...
I don't know... falling out
a window or something.
Not that I'm not grateful
for all the times you've
helped me, you understand.
- I understand.
- You do?
FIRST NATIONAL BANK
- It's the First National Bank.
- You better go, people might...
get hurt.
I understand, Lois.
Really you do?
Yep, you are a complete moron.
Thank you, Superman,
I think I'm a
total loser too. Geez.
A grateful president
bestows heartfelt thanks
on Metropolis' favorite son:
Superman.
Favorite son...
Mercy, start the car,
I'm coming down.
Right away, Lex.
The office, now.
Swell, Mr. L.
Mr. L.?
Mercy?
Oh yeah, she had
a little accident.
All right, missy,
I don't know what your game is,
but I promise you,
you'll pay dearly for this.
You're dead, do you hear me?
Blah, blah, blah.
Whoa, mama! Check out the cute hitchhiker!
- Joker.
- Lexy, old kid.
Do I have a deal for you.
- Ooh, rich Corinthian leather.
- What do you want?
I sense we are
kindred spirits, you and I.
Oh, there are differences
to be sure. Like hair.
But underneath it all,
we are both entrepreneurs,
men of vision.
We see an opportunity,
we grab it. Am I right?
Right. But in the past few weeks
I've had a run of bad luck.
Bad luck that wears a cape.
Thanks to that miserable,
pointy-eared rodent: Batman.
All my operations in Gotham
City have been shut down.
But you too have an overgrown
bully in long underwear,
which brings me to my little
proposition.
- I'm listening.
- Pay me one billion dollars
and I'll kill Superman.
What makes you think,
you can kill Superman
when you can't even handle a
mere mortal
in a Halloween costume?
There is nothing mere
about that mortal.
besides I've read up on your
flyboy, I know his weakness.
See, solid kryptonite.
You know, I can't be connected
to this in any way.
Oh, you will be Mr. Clean.
I promise. Deal?
Deal.
I hear Wayne's deal with Lexcorp
could run into the billions.
He's a high roller.
I hear he's nothing
but Gotham trash.
Rich, spoiled and...
absolutely gorgeous.
Mr. Wayne, Mr. Wayne!
What brings you to Metropolis?
How long will you stay?
Quick, is my hair straight?
Excuse me, aren't you
the famous Lois Lane?
Me? Famous? Hardly, I mean...
This is Clark Kent.
Mr. Wayne.
I read all about your adventure
on Air Force One.
You're quite the newsmaker.
Not more than you,
which brings up the question
of why you're in town.
Mr. Wayne, you car.
Maybe we can discuss it over
dinner. If you're available.
Totally. I-I mean I think so.
I'll have to check my cal- Yes.
Great.
I'll pick you up at eight.
Whoulda figure a guy named
Weasel can cook this good?
Ceasar Carlini, my old pal.
Why, I haven't seen you since...
Wait, I've never seen you,
have I?
You need to get out more.
- Who's this clown?
- Not clown, Joker.
I'm in town on business and
I need a place to hang my hat.
Try the motel nine.
But it would be so much cosier
at your place.
- Like a sleepover.
- Are you nuts?
Kill him!
Ooh, can I play too?
Carlini, all that spicy food.
You look a little gassy.
No! Stop!
Adios, muchacho.
Holy guacamole. Looks like,
you need a new leader.
I nominate me.
I second the nomination.
All opposed?
They found him like this
at the city dump.
The lights are on,
but nobody's home.
But we know who did it.
He's telling us right now.
As you can see,
the Wayne-Lex T7
can traverse
the most difficult terrain.
Never loosing sight of
it's ultimate target.
14.8 seconds
Congratulations.
This is your project too,
you know.
Well I'm proud of the work
both our teams have done.
These robots are gonna
revolutionize
unmanned space travel.
Actually there may be a use
for them closer to home.
The Joint Chiefs has shown
tremendous interest.
It doesn't take much imagination
to envision these robots
on the battlefield.
Except, I won't allow it.
- What?
- I don't like guns.
Well, Bruce, I think I have
something to say about this.
Not according to our deal.
All technological applications
need my approval first.
Blame it on me, Lex.
Tell your pals
at the Pentagon:
I just don't have
the imagination.
So he just appears, when there is
trouble? No special signal?
He's not like your
Batman, thank goodness.
Then how do you contact him?
Committing a felony helps.
Listen, you seem awfully
interested in Superman,
do you want me
to fix you two up?
- Sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.
it's just that I was hoping
to get away
from the subject of
the man of steel for one night.
I've been a little
too consumed with him lately.
Maybe we could change
subjects.
- No more men in tights?
- Deal.
So just keep your ears open.
Let me know, if you hear
any buzz about the Joker.
Sure thing, Mr. Kent.
But which one? There's
lots of jokers around here.
Hey, sweetheart,
what are you, deaf?
Come around.
What's going on?
Who is he?
What's happened?
It's been a long time,
Binko.
I heard, your boss, Carlini's been replaced.
We need to talk.
Get him!
Where's the Joker?
Who knows?
Making ha-ha with  Harley Quinn.
I don't know! Honest!
I never went back
after he muscled him.
I don't want nothing to do
with that clown.
That's enough.
I think you got your answer.
I heard you were crazy,
I didn't think you were stupid.
Bruce Wayne?
You peeped.
I won't have vigilantism
in my town.
You'll be rid of me
as soon as I find the Joker.
That may not be soon enough.
It doesn't take much, does it?
The Joker has 20 pounds more,
where this came from.
Thought you might
like to know.
- Hello.
- Hi.
I just wanted to let you know
I'll be in late tomorrow.
I'm having breakfast
with Bruce.
Isn't that special?
Do I detect
a note of disapproval?
You were the one who
compared him to garbage.
Well, I was wrong.
He's very thoughtful and
much deeper
than the gossip mongers
would lead you to believe.
- You'd be surprised.
- Would I now?
I'll let you go,
so you can count sheep
or whatever you Kansas boys
dream about. Bye.
Touché.
Senator declined comment.
Done.
And not a moment too soon.
- Bruce, when did you...?
- How about 3 paragraphs ago?
I didn't want to distract you.
Ready to do the town?
Give me a minute
to see the chief,
then I'm all yours.
Clark, keep an eye on Bruce.
Will you?
I'll be right back.
- Actually, Lois...
- Don't be intimidated
regale him with madcap tales
of the nightlife in Smallville.
- She never stops, does she?
- Not that I've noticed.
Any luck finding the comedian?
Three nights, and not so much
as a green hair.
Of course, you have been dividing
you time between work and Lois.
Is that a problem?
Let's just say I'm concerned.
Your reputation is dubious.
- In and out of costume.
- Don't worry.
I'm taking Lois
quite seriously.
Besides it seems to me,
you had your chance.
So, Mr. Wayne, ready to
sweep me off my feet?
Be seein' you.
- This city is gorgeous at night.
- Is it?
I wasn't looking
at the city.
Lois, about Clark Kent.
Are you and he...?
I mean...
No, Bruce, your only competition
flew away some time ago.
My, you do live dangerously.
Don't you realize
you're moving in on
Superman's main squeeze?
And then I said... huh?
They've got guns.
Take your hands off her,
you...
See that he's street pizza.
In this town some flying fool
could've caught him.
Well, aren't we tenacious?
Catch you next time, Brucie.
Swell. Now Gotham's
sending us their wackos.
Don't worry, Mr. Wayne, the SCU
will get her back safe and sound.
Thank you, inspector.
You realize
she's just the bait.
I'll be careful.
Careful won't cut it.
With Joker expect the unexpected.
Maybe, you should've
remembered that.
Think of it, Miss Lane. This
rock is more precious than gold.
One tincy chip will go
for thousands
on the collectors market.
After it killed your flyboy.
You sick, demented,
murdering freak.
How rude!
Half for now
and half for later.
You've got
a front row seat
for the story of the century,
my dear:
The death of Superman.
S.C.U, Turpin.
Amscray, turnip.
I wanna talk to the boy in blue.
You've got something to say,
clown? Say it to...
I'm here, Joker.
What've you done
with Lois Lane?
She's right here, Superman.
And she'd love to see you.
Want to know where here is?
Don't blink!
Got the picture, Supie?
Come alone. No cops or
little Lois dies laughing.
Wait, what picture?
What did he mean?
More powerful then a locomotive.
And just about as subtle.
I'm flattered you
put on your Sunday best.
- Where is she, Joker?
- Forget about Lois.
Feast your eyes on this.
Now I'll ask you once more.
I don't understand, I had it
all planned so perfectly.
- Oh wait, that's it.
- What?
Silly me. I forgot the acid.
What's the matter, Supie?
No steam left in the
old locomotive?
I hope you're taking notes.
Not now!
But Puddin',
Batman's headed your way.
Get out.
Pardon my hasty exit.
We have a pest-control problem.
Feel free to expire any time.
I'll be back in a moment.
Two for the price of one.
I love it.
And the best part is, you're
all going out with a smile.
Have a happy!
Hydrochloric acid.
It would take a week
to eat through the wall.
No, wait. Kryptonite.
Snap out of it, Kent,
or Joker gets the last laugh.
Keep you heads down.
- Uh-oh. They're loose!
- That's not fair!
It's over, Joker.
It hasn't begun, Supie.
He's got to be kidding.
- They're grenades.
- Expect the unexpected.
Thank you. I couldn't have
saved Lois without you help.
I'm aware of that.
Bruce, Bruce Wayne,
he was with me when Joker...
- Is he all right? Do you know?
- He's fine.
Just fine.
I wish to assure
all of Metropolis
that this explosion
was non-nuclear
and presents no danger
to the community.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
What about the Joker, Mr. Luthor?
- I have a question.
- You heard the man.
What could have possessed me
to trust that clown?
Hello, Mr. J, I'm Batman.
Eat me, eat me, eat me!
I know you're trying to
cheer me up, Harley.
But you see, any time I blow
a billion dollar deal...
it really kills my appetite.
Honestly, Lex, don't you think
I feel bad enough already?
You maniac, you idiot,
how dare you use one of my
laboratories for your...?
Harley!
Put him down, baldy.
Mercy!
Here's for that
punch in the face.
Can't we discuss this
like gentlemen?
Listen to little
Miss Can't-Take-A-Joke!
Thank you, have a seat,
please.
Bansai!
You owe me an explanation.
The lab was a perfect setup.
How did I know ol' Bat-breath
would show up?
- Batman?
- He followed you to Metropolis?
Right, like it's my fault.
Look, I've still got
half the kryptonite.
I can still finish the job.
But if I have to cope with two
men in tights, the price goes up.
Unacceptable.
If you can't handle some
mental case in a fright mask...
our deal is off.
Mercy, let's go.
Keep in mind:
this is your last chance.
- How you doing, slugger?
- A-okay, Mr. J.
Hey, Smallville, come in.
What's up?
I see, you're holding up after
last night. I've been...
I didn't realize
you had company.
Whoa, you might at least
tell me why you stopped by.
I've been nosing around.
I think I may know why the Joker
is suddenly after Superman.
Well, don't keep us in suspense.
I think he's in cahoots
with your boyfriend's
business partner.
- With Lex? Are you sure?
- I can't prove it, yet.
I suppose I could ask him.
What? Who?
- What do you want?
- Information...
regarding a mutual of Queens.
What are you talking about?
I don't know any...
You know exactly who I mean.
Where is he? What kind of
deal have you made with him?
I don't... I...
- Mr. Luthor, are you all right?
- Who's in there?
- Open up!
- He's in trouble.
- The door is locked.
- I have the key.
Think about it, I'll be back.
All right, break it in.
- Mr. Luthor?
- Get out!
Contact the clown immediately.
It appears we'll have to deal
with his friend after all.
A transfer?
Just to the Planet's
Gotham City bureau.
Does this mean,
you and Bruce...
We haven't made a formal
commitment or anything, but...
yeah, it's that serious.
Hey! Chin up, Smallville,
with me out of the picture
you might get a shot at stardom.
Lois! Clark!
I just got word the
cruise ship S.S.Atlantis
is sending a distress call
200 miles off shore.
Whoa!
Exactly.
Call the Coast Guard to confirm,
and the cruise line
for a statement.
You're not out of here yet,
Lane.
What the devil
is he up to now?
A change of attire, sir?
How fast can we
get to Hobbs Bay?
If I may be so bold.
When you're home, sir.
- What's the problem, captain?
- What do you mean?
You sent out a distress call,
didn't you?
Not on my authorization.
There's the culprit.
It's broadcasting an
electronic beacon.
If one of my crew is responsible
for this prank, they...
What is it?
What's happening?
Whoever sent that
distress signal,
he just provided the  distress.
Copy that, copy that.
Suffering from
propulsion envy, Batboy?
Think of it as a welcome
wagon, Bats.
Welcoming you
to the nearest mortuary.
This could be a fair fight
after all.
And who wants to see that?
Evening, Miss Lane.
Where's Mr. Kent?
Probably out
husking some corn.
- Miss Lane?
- Yeah, I'm still here.
Superman's towing the ship
to harbor?
Can you find out,
how close he is?
Yeah, I'll hold.
Let me guess,
you're the only one here.
Is there something
I should know?
- How do I contact Superman?
- He's out at sea.
Never around,
when you need him.
Stay here,
I'm the one it's after.
Bruce?
 So when were you going to
tell me... the honeymoon?
Stay back.
Did I miss anything?
Reports indicate
target acquisition negative,
Mr. Luthor. Sorry.
He survived. He lasted long
enough for Superman to save him.
- Then they have the robot.
- I know.
But, Lex, they'll
trace it back to you.
I know.
Call the clown, I need
one last meeting.
How could you have lied to me
like that?
Now, I never actually said
I wasn't Batman.
You wanna know
what really galls me?
I mean beside the fact
that the new man in my life
is really two men,
it's that I'm sitting on the
hottest story of the year:
Batman unmasked!
And there's not a blasted thing
I can do about it.
Then you really do love me.
I'll get some iodine
for that scrape.
Burning, stinging iodine.
- I see, she is taking it well.
- It's ironic, you know.
She likes Bruce Wayne
and she likes Superman.
It's the other to guys
she's not crazy about.
Too bad, we can't mix and match.
I'm not used to being rescued.
Thanks.
- I owed you one.
- That robot tonight.
It came from Lexcorp,
I can prove it.
That's why I'm here.
I figured you might want to
help me bring Luthor in.
A partnership?
You're joking.
 Actually, I'm having trouble
finding Luthor
and I thought
you might have some ideas.
I might.
She's not gonna like this.
Me leaving so soon
for another fight.
Tell me about it.
That cut on you shoulder
looked pretty nasty, Bruce.
I know a good doctor, who...
Oh, no.
Has to be done.
I don't suppose
a stern lecture on
unnecessary risk-taking
is going to sway you.
Sorry.
I didn't think so. Just be...
careful.
Look at all the toys.
Santa's been
good to you, Lex.
Joker, we've got
serious problems.
A flying wing. 20 times
bigger than Batman's.
And knowing you,
a 100 times as lethal.
Joker, did you bring
the rest of the kryptonite?
Right here, chromedome.
What's the plan?
Payback.
What's so funny?
Don't you get it, Harl?
We're being set up
to take the fall.
- He can't do that.
- Oh, no? How does this sound?
When I heard that
one of my robots
had been commandeered
to kill Batman
I personally came here
to investigate
and much to my surprise...
I found you two.
It'd be your word
against Puddin's.
I... I mean Mr. J's.
Somehow, poodle,
I don't think we are gonna
get the chance to say much.
You... You mean,
he's gonna kill us?
No, she is.
I abhor violence.
Now this is funny, Mr. J.
Except we're never gonna
collect our billion bucks now.
True, but I see a delightful
conciliation prize.
Nothing,
but a nice, big smile.
All done.
I love to personalize
all my stuff.
Very amusing.
So how much is it going to
cost me to get out of this?
I'm not a material guy,
Lexy. No.
What I want now
is for you to know
what it feels like
to lose everything you have.
Everything you've ever built.
Like I lost everything
to old Batboy.
We have incoming.
Bats and flyboy.
I'll be right in.
Buh-bye.
See anything?
Luthor's been lining
his buildings with lead.
It blocks my x-ray vision.
Well, there's always
the direct approach.
You're learning.
A little distraction would be
useful right now,
wouldn't you say, Lexy?
I think your toys can
handle this by themselves.
Besides, I hate to spoil
my new paintjob.
Now, lets see here...
Ignition.
Couldn't have done
it better myself.
It helps if you're prepared.
Where's Luthor?
Joker took him in the Lex wing.
He said he'd make him
lose everything he ever built.
Luthor's built
half of Metropolis.
Go after the Joker.
I shouldn't be long.
How's it feel, Lexy boy?
Everything with your name on it
is going to be rubble.
Batman. It's always Batman.
What you got in the way of
air-to-air missiles, Lex?
You're asking me for help?
If I go down, you go down.
It's a red switch.
Which red...
Ah the heck with it.
Lead-lined door.
I'll have to thank Luthor.
Who's flying this thing?
Do something for God's sake!
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.
It's gonna blow. I'll get
Quinn, you take Luthor.
- Pudding.
- At this point, he probably is.
Hello. This is Angela Chen.
Though the search for
Joker's body continues
the Coast Guard reports it is
extremely unlikely
that Gotham's most notorious
criminal survived the crash.
In related news,
billionaire Lex Luthor
was again rigorously grilled
by the D.A.'s office
over his alleged connection
to the Joker's rampage.
His statements have been
questioned both by
local law officials and
industrialist Bruce Wayne,
who announced
the immediate termination
of his partnership
with Lexcorp.
And on a lighter note,
Joker accomplice Harley Quinn
was returned to Arkham Asylum
for another round
of rehabilitation.
I want a lawyer! I want a doctor!
I wanna cheese sandwich!
Now that's funny.
I still wish you'd change
your mind about Gotham.
I adore you, Bruce,
but now there's a lot
about you I don't know and
I'm not sure I wanna know.
- I understand.
- Take care of yourself.
Come to make sure,
I'm leaving?
Actually, I thought we worked
pretty well together.
Not that I wanna make it
a regular event.
She's all yours now.
If you can handle that.
But you better be good to her.
Because I know
where you live.
