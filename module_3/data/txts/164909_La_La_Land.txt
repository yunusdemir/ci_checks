Shakespeare in love.
I mean, we could not
believe what was happening.
I swear to god,
she was wrecked.
She was
completely wrecked!
I know. I know.
It was pure insanity.
It's insanity...
Ah!
"Lunacy! It was pure lunacy."
What is his prob...
I should go.
Cappuccino, please.
Right.
Of course.
On us.
Oh, no, thank you.
I insist.
Did you see
who that was?
Shit!
Mia, where do you think
you're going?
Oh, it's five after.
Better be here
early tomorrow.
Okay.
Have a good night!
Oh!
She was wrecked!
It was pure lunacy.
It was so crazy,
and I just...
Oh, you would have died.
No, Turner's fine.
Turner's fine. I just, um...
Are you gonna
wait 'til Denver
to tell her, or...
What?
Okay.
No, I'm happy for you.
I am. I'm happy for you.
I just...
I just thought...
- I don't know...
- One second.
I guess I thought...
What, Ruby?
Jessica's on the phone.
Um,
tell her I'll call her back.
In two minutes?
Less than two minutes.
I'll go
get your lunch.
I'm almost done. Thank you.
Oh. You know what?
I think we're good.
Thanks for coming in.
Whoa! Holy shit!
You wanna open a window?
I was trying to give you
an entrance.
Thank you.
Mia!
How'd the audition go?
Eh.
Eh, same here.
Was Jen there
or Rachel?
I don't know
who Jen and Rachel are.
They're the worst.
Well, I don't know
if they were there.
I bet they were.
Why is there
a convention in the
bathroom?
Two minutes,
people.
Mia, you're
coming, right?
I can't!
I'm working.
What?
Did she just
say "working"?
What?
I'm sorry
it didn't go well today
and there's
four things in my inbox
that you're perfect for
and I will submit you.
But right now you're coming!
It'll be fun.
It's not
gonna be fun.
It could be.
It's not. It's gonna be
a bunch of social climbers
all packed into
one of those
big glass houses.
This looks familiar.
I was gonna
give that back.
How long have you had this?
A long time.
Come on, Mia.
When else are you
gonna get to see
every Hollywood cliche
crammed into the same room?
We'll make
fun of it together!
I'm disappointed
in you, Lex.
There's nothing
to make fun of.
This party's gonna be
humanity at its finest.
Oh, god help us all!
Hey, girl!
No, no.
Oh, come on!
What?
Ahh!
Please stop
sneaking into my home.
You think mom or dad
would call this a home?
What are you doing?
Please don't do that.
Please don't sit on that.
Are you kidding?
Please don't sit on that.
Don't sit on that.
Don't sit on that.
Hoagy Carmichael
sat on that!
Oh, my god!
The baked potato
just threw it away.
I can't imagine why.
And now you're
just sitting on it.
I got you
a throw rug.
I don't need that.
What if I said
miles Davis pissed on it?
It's almost insulting.
Is it true?
When are you gonna
unpack these boxes?
When I unpack them
in my own club.
Oh, Sebastian.
It's like
a girl broke up with you
and you're stalking her.
You're not still going
by there, are you?
That's...
You won't believe
that they turned it into
a samba-tapas place.
Oh, my god,
Sebastian!
Samba. Tapas.
Pick one, you know?
Do one right.
I have someone
i want you to meet.
I don't wanna
meet anyone.
No, no,
i don't wanna
meet anyone.
Dad gave you this?
Yes.
You'll like her.
I don't think
I'm gonna like her.
Does she like jazz?
Probably not.
Then what are we
gonna talk about?
I don't know!
It doesn't matter. Okay?
Because you're living
like a hermit.
You're driving
without insurance!
It doesn't matter?
Yeah, it doesn't matter.
Okay.
Well, I know a guy...
You need to get serious.
...with a face tattoo
that you should see.
Okay, low blow.
With a heart
of gold.
Get serious!
"Get serious"?
Laura...
I had a very serious
plan for my future.
I know.
It's not my fault
i got shanghaied.
You didn't get shanghaied.
You got ripped off!
What's
the difference?
I don't know.
It's not as romantic
as that.
Don't sit...
Everybody knew that guy
was shady except for you.
Why do you say "romantic"
like it's a dirty word?
Unpaid bills
are not romantic.
Call her.
I'm not
gonna call her.
And the thing is
you're acting like
life's got me
on the ropes.
I want to be
on the ropes. Okay?
I'm letting life hit me
'til it gets tired.
Oh?
Then I'm gonna hit back.
It's a classic
rope-a-dope.
Okay, Ali. I love you.
Unpack the boxes.
I'm gonna change
the locks.
You can't afford it.
I'm a Phoenix
rising from the ashes.
Hey.
Bill. Thanks for
having me back.
You're welcome.
Want you to know
you're lookin'
at a new man.
A man that's happy
to be here.
Good. Excellent.
Very-easy-
to-work-with man.
And you're going to
play the set list?
Happy to.
Even though
i don't think
anyone cares what I play,
but, yeah...
Well, if by "anyone,"
you mean
anyone other than me,
that would be correct.
I care,
and I don't wanna
hear the free jazz.
Right. Okay.
Although I thought
in this town
it worked on a sort of
"one for you, one for me"
type system.
How 'bout two for you,
one for me?
How 'bout all for you
and none for me?
That's perfect, yes.
Great.
Okay.
Mutual decision, then.
Right. Made by me.
Right.
And I sign off
on it, so...
Whatever. Tell yourself
what you wanna know.
Well. Welcome back.
There's a nice way
to say that, Karen.
Seb.
I hear
what you're saying,
but I don't think
you're saying
what you mean.
Yeah, I don't think
you hear what I'm saying.
You're fired.
Well, that's what
you're saying,
but it's not
what you mean.
What you mean is...
You're fired.
"Play the set list."
No, I'm saying
it's too late.
It's a warning.
What planet
are you from?
Don't fire me, bill.
You're done.
Don't fire me.
I'm sorry, seb.
It's Christmas.
Yeah, I see
the decorations.
Good luck
in the new year.
I just heard you play,
and I wanted to...
I don't like the fissure
on the gt scan.
Did you test
for achromatopsia?
Doa on 23rd. Perp laughin'
his face off at the pd.
Damn Miranda rights.
This is my classroom.
You don't like it,
the door's to my left.
Lady, why you be
trippin' like that?
No, Jamal.
You be trippin'.
Jump right here!
Oh, Mia!
Hi.
Hi.
I want you to meet
my friend, Carlo.
Hi.
Hi. Carlo.
Carlo, this is Mia.
Nice to...
Mia?
Hi. How are you?
Yes, Mia.
Carlo is a writer.
Yeah. They say
i have a knack
for world-building.
I got a lot of heat
right now.
There's been
a lot of buzz,
people talkin' about me,
which is exciting.
I mean, you work so hard,
and then all that validation.
I'm gonna
grab a drink.
Okay.
Nice to meet you.
Sorry.
<i> Thank you.</i>
<i> Any other requests?</i>
<i> Girl in the front!</i>
<i> I ran.</i>
I ran.
<i> A fantastic suggestion.</i>
<i> All right, piano man,</i>
<i> tickle those ivories.</i>
<i> Let's hit it.</i>
<i> One! Two!</i>
<i> Three! Four!</i>
<i> That's right.</i>
Me?
Stop.
All right. I remember you.
And I'll admit
I was a little curt
that night.
Curt?
Okay, I was an asshole.
I can admit that.
Okay.
But requesting <i> I ran</i>
from a serious musician,
it's just... it's too far.
My lord! Did you just say
"a serious musician"?
I don't think so.
Can I borrow
what you're wearing?
Why?
'Cause I have
an audition next week.
I'm playing
a "serious"
firefighter.
So you're an actress.
I thought
you looked familiar.
Have I seen you
in anything?
Uh...
Coffee shop
on the Warner
brothers lot.
That's a classic.
Oh, I see.
Yeah.
You're a barista.
And I could see
how you could then
look down on me
from all the way
up there.
Time for next set.
He doesn't...
I don't...
He doesn't tell me
what to do.
He just told you
what to do.
I know. I let him.
What's your name?
Mia.
Mia.
Guess I'll see you
in the movies.
You heard
of Joseph Campbell?
Uh, yeah.
I have this idea to do
a re-imagine
of "goldilocks and
the three bears..."
But from the perspective
of the bears.
<i> The hero's journey.</i>
It could be
like a franchise.
Right.
So we don't know.
There could have been
a fourth bear,
we don't know.
George Michael!
Hello.
Sorry.
Yeah, yeah.
I know that guy.
Did you get your keys?
Mmm-hmm, yes.
Can you grab mine?
Can I what?
Would you be able
to grab mine? My keys?
- I can't hear.
- Sorry.
Can you grab my keys?
Oh.
Please?
Oh, there we go.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
- What kind?
- It's a prius.
That doesn't help me.
With a green ribbon.
All right.
Those
look, uh, comfortable.
They are.
Thank you
for saving the day
back there.
Well, you didn't really
give me much of a choice.
It's pretty strange
that we keep running
into each other.
It is strange.
Maybe it means
something.
I doubt it.
Yeah, I don't think so.
Where's my car?
You gotta put that thing
to your chin.
This?
Yeah.
It makes your head
into an antenna, so...
Ooh.
I think it gives you cancer,
but you find your car faster.
What?
You don't live as long,
but you get
where you're going quicker,
so it all evens out.
That sounds terrible.
Just a suggestion.
You're...
You're a real, um...
What's the word
I'm looking for?
"Knight in
shining armor"?
Weirdo.
That was the word.
Okay.
Not much
to look at, huh?
I've seen
better.
Really?
But you'll call?
It's wool.
Ah!
Hi, Greg.
Oh, sorry I'm late.
Yeah. Be there soon.
Okay. Bye.
It was just
right there.
Just right here.
Do you want a ride
to your car?
No, I'm just
right up here.
Good night.
Good night.
Excuse me. This is
gluten-free, right?
No.
What?
Mmm-mmm.
Ugh!
I'd like a refund.
Okay. Let me
check on that
for you.
Mia...
Hi.
You're closing Friday.
I can't close on Friday.
I have an audition.
Remember?
Do I look like I care?
Reschedule it.
Oh, and we need
to have a little talk
tomorrow, okay?
Fix your apron, please.
Okay.
You again!
What are you doing here?
Oh, you know, just meetings
and...Studio heads and...
How'd you get on the lot?
I basically
just hauled ass past
the guard gates.
I think
i have 20 minutes
until they find me.
You don't have a break
coming up, do you?
I'm off
in 10 minutes.
Can I hide
in the bathroom?
Yes.
Okay.
Sorry.
Um...
I actually
do have to check.
I'm sorry.
That's the window
that Humphrey bogart
and Ingrid bergman
looked out of in <i> Casablanca.</i>
- Wow!
- Yeah.
I can't believe you work
right across the street
from that.
Yeah.
That's amazing.
What was your
bogart's name?
What's his name?
Is it Greg?
Yeah. Greg.
Right. How long
have you been...
We've been
seeing each other
for about a month.
Oh, that's great.
He's, um...
He's sweet.
Anyway, I love
being around this
stuff, you know?
I know
what you mean.
I get coffee 5 miles
out of the way
just so I can be
near a jazz club.
Really?
Yeah, the Van beek.
Do you know it?
Mmm-mmm.
All the big swing bands
used to play there.
Count basie,
chick webb.
Anyway, it's
a samba-tapas
place now, so...
What's
a samba-tapas place?
It's just a samba place
where they serve tapas.
Oh.
Yeah, so the joke's on...
History?
I don't know.
That's la.
They just worship everything
and they value nothing.
We're about to roll.
Stop, please, guys.
Okay.
You're rolling?
Yeah.
Yeah, I know.
They shoot movies
on my street all the time,
so I know about movies.
- Come this way.
- Great.
- It's a lock-down.
- I love her!
- And here we go.
Hey!
How'd you get
into all this?
And roll!
- Get into what?
- Sound speed!
You know,
movies, acting...
Action!
Oh, um...
My aunt was
an actress.
Oh, okay.
She was in a traveling
theater company.
I grew up
in Boulder city, Nevada.
So across the street
from my house
there was this
little library
that had an old
movie section.
So she took me
and we spent
an entire day watching
all these old movies
like <i> notorious</i>
and <i> bringing up baby</i>
and <i> Casablanca.</i>
- And...
- Cut it there! Cut!
- Check the gate.
- So we can talk now.
She sounds
incredible.
She was incredible.
And I would put on
all these plays
in my bedroom,
and it would basically
just be she and I
re-enacting those scenes
from the movies.
And then I would
write my own plays.
Wow.
Um... yeah.
I love it.
So anyway, I left college
after two years to come here
and my last audition was
for a teen show pitched as
<i> "dangerous minds</i>
meets <i> the o.C."</i>
So, yeah, should've
been a lawyer.
'Cause the world
needs more lawyers.
It doesn't
need more actresses.
You're not
just an actress.
What do you mean
"just an actress"?
You said it yourself.
You're
a child prodigy
playwright.
That is not
what I said.
Well, you're too modest
to say it, but it's true.
You could just write
your own roles, you know?
Write something that's
as interesting as you are,
and you don't have to
audition for this...
Uh, pissy ca-ca.
Yeah.
Look at Louis Armstrong.
He could've just played
the marching band charts
that he was given.
But he didn't do that.
What did he do?
What did he do?
He made history,
didn't he?
Well, I'm gonna
stop auditioning
and I'm gonna make
history instead.
Well, my work
is done here.
I should probably
tell you something now,
just to get it
out of the way.
Mmm-hmm?
I hate jazz.
Are you okay?
What do you mean
you hate jazz?
It just means that
when I listen to it,
i don't like it.
Yeah, but it's such
a blanket statement,
you don't like jazz.
What are you doing
right now?
Nothing.
I just think that people,
when they say that they,
you know, hate jazz...
They just...
They don't have context,
they don't know
where it comes from.
Jazz was born in a little
flophouse in New Orleans,
and it's just because
people were crammed
in there,
they spoke
five different languages,
they couldn't
talk to each other.
The only way
they could communicate
was with jazz.
Yeah, but what
about Kenny g?
What?
What about Kenny g?
I mean, what about
elevator music?
You know,
jazz music that I know?
What about it?
From my life?
Mmm-hmm?
I just find it relaxing.
It's not relaxing.
It's not. It's not.
Sidney bechet
shot somebody
because they told him
he played a wrong note.
That's hardly relaxing.
Yeah, but where
i grew up
there was this station
called kjazz 103.
And people would
just put on that station
when they had
a cocktail party...
Right.
And everyone would
kinda just talk over it.
I know.
'Cause it was...
That's the prob...
Okay, okay.
So I think that's
part of the problem,
is that you can't
hear it, you know?
You have to see it.
You have to see
what's at stake.
I mean, look
at these fellas.
Look at the sax player
right now.
He just hijacked the song.
He's on his own trip.
Every one of these guys
is composing,
they're rearranging,
they're writing.
Then they're
playing the melody.
They're just...
And now look,
the trumpet player.
He's got his own idea.
And so, it's conflict
and it's compromise,
and it's just...
It's new every time.
It's brand-new
every night.
It's
very, very exciting.
And it's dying.
It's dying, Mia.
It's dying on the vine.
And the world says,
"let it die.
It had its time."
Well, not on my watch.
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna have my own club.
Really?
Yes.
We're gonna play
whatever we want,
whenever we want,
however we want,
as long as it's pure jazz.
<i> Hi, this is Mia Dolan.</i>
Yeah, I just missed a call.
I got a callback!
What? Come on!
For what?
For a TV show. The one I was
telling you about earlier.
The <i> "dangerous minds</i>
meets <i> the o.C."?</i>
Yeah.
Congratulations!
That's incredible!
It's really exciting.
I feel like I said negative
stuff about it before.
What?
It's like <i> rebel without</i>
<i> a cause,</i> sort of.
"I got the bullets!"
Yes.
You've never seen it!
I've never seen it.
Oh, my! You know,
it's playing at the rialto.
Really?
Yes.
You should go... I mean,
i can take you.
Okay.
You know,
for research.
For research.
Yeah. Okay.
Yeah.
Um, Monday night, 10:00.
Yeah. Great.
Okay.
For research.
Stand right there,
please.
Nice to meet you.
Hi.
Hi.
In your own time.
Okay.
Two options.
You either follow my rules
or follow my rules.
<i> Capisce?</i>
Thank you.
- Oh...
- Thanks.
I can do it
a different way.
No, that's fine.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
That was fun. Thanks.
Bye.
Oh, hey, Mia?
Hey.
Greg's here.
What do you mean...
Hey, babe.
Got a space out front.
Great. Okay...
We should get going.
My brother landed
really early.
Did you forget?
Shit.
You forgot.
That's tonight.
That's okay.
You forgot.
Yeah. Okay.
All right, so then
I'll just get changed.
Okay. Great.
Okay. Great.
Yeah, that's him.
Um...
Hey, Josh, yeah. Uh...
Just pickin' up Mia.
We'll be there in, like...
<i> But now we've got this</i>
<i> surround-sound set-up,</i>
<i> so it's like...</i>
It's like being
- in a movie theater.
- Wow.
But better than being
in a theater, really.
I can't wait.
You know theaters these days.
Yeah.
They're so dirty.
Yeah, I know.
And so smelly.
And they're either
too hot or too cold.
I know. The quality's
really fallen off.
The quality's terrible.
And there's always
people talking.
'Cause of all of
the people seeing the movie.
Which is just...
Oh, it's the worst!
Oh, I'm sorry.
- Hold on one second.
- The texting.
Hello?
Probably work.
Mmm.
Sorry. So, yeah,
we love it.
Oh, it's so nice.
Well, we have
to come. Maybe.
You should. Come by.
I got one word
for you, man.
Mmm-hmm?
- Indonesia.
Never heard
anyone say that.
I don't even know.
I can't keep track of it,
but honestly
it was life-changing.
- Really?
- Yeah.
It affected me.
It was incredible.
Is it amazing?
Yes.
A 5-star jungle
eco-resort
you would
not believe.
Amazing.
We were thinking
about Nicaragua,
the thing about Nicaragua
is it's less developed.
It's a little under-developed.
Right.
I think
there's a little more...
Yeah, then, I just
don't know if it's safe.
Yeah, yeah. It's...
I don't know if it's safe.
Yeah, you don't want
to explore too far.
Kind of a "natives are
restless" sort of thing.
Actually, China's going
to build a Panama canal.
I'm sorry.
<i> ...the</i>
<i> immensity of our universe.</i>
<i> For many days</i>
<i> before the end of our earth</i>
<i> people will look into the</i>
<i> night sky and notice a star</i>
<i> increasingly bright</i>
<i> and increasingly near.</i>
<i> As this star approaches us...</i>
<i> Jim stark.</i>
<i> I'll go find a place.</i>
<i> I'm sorry.</i>
<i> As this star</i>
<i> approaches us,</i>
<i> the weather will change.</i>
<i> The great polar fields</i>
<i> of the north and south</i>
<i> will rot and divide,</i>
<i> and the seas will turn warm.</i>
<i> The last of us</i>
<i> search the heavens</i>
<i> and stand amazed,</i>
<i> for the stars will still be</i>
<i> there and will be...</i>
Mmm...
I have an idea.
What is that?
Is it a script?
It's a play.
A play?
You better
give us all roles!
Actually, it's
a one-woman show!
So I can't.
Wow. Is that gonna
happen every time?
I think so.
Ahh! It's one-way!
I love you.
I love you, too.
Oh!
Sebastian?
Keith.
Come here, man.
How are you?
I've been good, man.
This is Mia.
Mia, Keith.
Hi, Mia. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
I used to play with this guy.
Went to school together.
So how you been, brother?
Great.
Never been better.
How 'bout you?
I been really good.
Been very busy.
I got a new combo.
Okay. Cool.
We're lookin' for keys.
Are you kidding me?
No, I'm not kidding you.
No, I'm good.
Are you sure? It pays.
I'm good.
Let's just grab a drink then.
It's been too long.
Okay.
Nice to meet you, Mia.
Nice to meet you.
"The end."
Genius.
Really?
Yes.
Really?
Yes.
It feels really
nostalgic to me.
Is it too nostalgic?
That's the point.
Are people
gonna like it?
Fuck 'em.
You always say that.
Well, I truly believe it.
I made you something.
For what?
For your club.
Why does it
say "seb's"?
'Cause I think
you should call it "seb's."
What?
'Cause no one's gonna come
to "chicken on a stick."
Is that a music note
as an apostrophe?
Yes! Yeah.
That's pretty cool.
It's gotta be
"chicken on a stick."
Because Charlie Parker
got his nickname...
I know,
because he loved chicken.
That's why they
called him "bird."
So I'm gonna have
chicken, beer, jazz...
"Chicken on a stick."
I know. You should
drop the chicken
and just have drinks
and jazz, and also...
I'm not droppin'
the chicken.
You could maybe
do it somewhere else.
What are you talk...
Find a new spot.
It's gotta be
the Van beek.
Well, it doesn't
have to be the Van beek.
I can't let them samba
all over its history.
I can't do it.
You can let them,
but you refuse to.
Your play's incredible.
You know, the whole world
from your bedroom.
What else do they want?
Who's doing that?
I'm doing that.
You're doing that.
Who was that guy
at the lighthouse?
The guy
that offered you
the gig?
Keith.
Yeah.
Why was it so weird
between you two?
It's always weird
with him.
Really?
Yeah.
But he seemed
kinda nice
'cause he did
offer you a job.
Are you gonna
call him?
No. No.
All right.
So...Here's what we know.
Yeah?
It's definitely
"chicken on a stick,"
and your play
is gonna be a triumph.
It's a one-woman show,
so it's just me...
No, I mean,
I'm acting in it, too.
No, mom.
I'm not getting paid.
I'm paying to do it.
He's great. He's gonna
open his own jazz club.
Yeah, it's gonna be
incredible.
No, he hasn't,
he hasn't opened it yet.
He needs some...
He's saving up, I think.
No, he doesn't have
a steady gig.
But he's figuring it out.
It's just been
a little tricky lately.
Mom, he's gonna
find a way to open it
and you're gonna
love it, okay?
How's dad?
Sebastian.
Come on in, man.
Thanks for comin'.
Thanks for having me.
Wasn't sure
I'd see you today.
So...Here's
the deal.
Okay.
We got distribution
with universal.
We've got
our own imprint.
About to go
on the road.
Uh, we can pay you
1,000 bucks a week,
plus a cut
of the ticket revenue
and merchandising.
Sound good?
Sebastian?
All right.
Yeah.
Let's play.
Okay.
I know.
It's different.
But you say
you wanna save jazz.
How you gonna save jazz
if no one's listening?
Jazz is dying
because of people like you.
You're playin'
to 90-year-olds
at the lighthouse.
Where are the kids?
Where are the young people?
You're so obsessed with
Kenny Clarke
and thelonious monk.
These guys were
revolutionaries.
How are you gonna be
a revolutionary
if you're
such a traditionalist?
You're holdin' onto the past,
but jazz is about the future.
I know.
The other guy,
he wasn't as good as you.
But you're a pain
in the ass, man.
Hey, it's me.
Uh, I'm not sure
where you are right now.
I think Boston.
Maybe Dallas,
i don't know.
Uh...
I haven't heard from you
in a little while
and I miss you.
All right, bye.
I thought...
Surprise.
Gotta leave first thing
in the morning,
but I just
had to see you...
It's so nice to be home.
I'm so glad
you're home.
How's the play goin'?
Um... I'm nervous.
You are? Why?
Mmm-hmm.
Because what if people
show up?
Pissy ca-ca.
You nervous about
what they think?
I'm nervous to do it.
I'm nervous to get up
on a stage
and perform
for people...
I mean, I don't need
to say that to you.
It's gonna be incredible.
You don't get it,
but I'm terrified.
They should be
so lucky to see it.
I can't wait.
I can.
When do you leave,
the morning?
Yeah. 6:45.
Ooh.
Boise.
Boy-he?
Boyden.
To Boise!
You should come.
To Boise?
Yeah, you can knock that
off your bucket list.
Oh, that would be
really exciting.
I wish I could.
What are you doing
after the tour?
Why can't you?
Come to Boise?
Yeah.
'Cause I have to
rehearse.
But can't you
rehearse anywhere?
Anywhere you are?
I mean, I guess.
Um...
All my stuff is here,
and it's in two weeks,
so I don't really think
that would be...
Okay.
...the best idea
right now, but
I wish I could.
We're just gonna
have to try and
see each other.
We never see each other.
I know, but when
are you done?
What do you mean?
When are you finished
with the whole tour?
After we finish,
we're gonna go and record,
and then
we go back on tour.
We tour so we can
make the record
so we can go back
and tour the record.
So it's like
the long haul?
What do you mean,
"the long haul"?
I mean the long haul.
Like you're gonna
stay in this band
for a long time.
On tour.
What did you think
i was gonna do?
I don't... I hadn't really
thought it through.
I didn't know
that the band
was so important.
You didn't think
it would be successful?
Um...
No, that's not really
what I mean.
I just mean that you...
You're gonna be on tour for,
what, months now? Years?
Yeah. I don't believe...
This is it.
I mean, it could easily be...
I could be on tour
with this for a couple
of years, at least.
Just this record.
Do you like the music
you're playing?
I don't...
I don't know
what it matters.
Well, it matters,
because if you're gonna
give up your dream...
I think it matters
that you like
what you're playing
on the road for years.
Do you like the music
I'm playing?
Yeah.
I do.
I just didn't think
that you did.
Yeah, well...
You always said Keith
is the worst,
and now you're gonna be
on tour with him for years,
so I just didn't...
What are you doing right now?
...Know if you were happy.
Why are you doing this?
I don't...
What do you mean,
why am I doing this?
I thought
you wanted me to do this.
It just sounds like now
you don't want me to do it.
What do you mean,
i wanted you to do this?
This is what
you wanted for me.
To be in this band?
To be in a band.
To have a steady job,
you know?
To be... you know.
Of course I wanted you
to have a steady job,
so that you could
take care
of yourself and your life
and you could start your club.
So I'm doing that.
So I don't understand.
Why aren't we celebrating?
Why aren't you
starting your club?
You said yourself no one
wants to go to that club.
No one wants to go to a club
called "chicken on a stick."
So change the name!
Well, no one likes jazz!
Not even you!
I do like jazz now
because of you!
And this is what I thought
you wanted me to do!
What am I supposed to do?
Go back to playing
<i> jingle bells?</i>
I'm not saying that.
I'm saying
why don't you take
what you've made...
Scraping pennies
so I can start a club...
...and start the club?
...No one wants to go to?
People will want
to go to it
because you're passionate
about it,
and people love
what other people
are passionate about.
You remind people
of what they forgot.
Not in my experience.
Well, whatever, all right?
It's just time to grow up,
you know?
I have a steady job,
this is what I'm doing.
And now all of a sudden
if you had these problems,
I wish you would have
said them earlier,
before I signed
on the goddamn dotted line!
I'm pointing out
that you had a dream
that you followed,
that you were sticking to...
This is the dream!
This is the dream.
This is not your dream!
Guys like me
work their whole lives
to be in something
that's successful,
that people like.
You know?
I mean, I'm finally
in something
that people enjoy.
Since when do you care
about being liked?
Just 'cause I don't enjoy,
it doesn't matter.
Why do you care so much
about being liked?
You're an actress!
What are you talking about?
Maybe you just liked me
when I was on my ass
'cause it made you
feel better about yourself.
Are you kidding?
No.
I don't know.
Okay, fellas.
I'll see ya tomorrow.
Sebastian?
Yeah?
You're good for
tonight, right?
What are you
talking about?
7:00, the photo shoot.
<i> Mojo.</i> Are you good?
I thought
that was next Thursday.
No, it's tonight.
Is that okay?
Give me the other camera!
What's wrong
with that one?
"What's wrong
with that one?"
It doesn't bloody work,
that's what's wrong with it!
All right, trumpet,
that's lovely.
Lovely! Beautiful, beautiful!
Okay, keyboard.
Okay, look up.
That's good. That's good,
that's lovely. Lovely.
Okay, cut the music!
That is lovely.
That's lovely.
Okay, now bite your lip
like this, sort of like...
Like you're concentrating
on something,
I don't know,
like a piece
of your music.
Bite my what?
Your lip. You know,
bite your lip...
Okay.
Yeah, that's good.
That's great.
Beautiful! Beautiful.
Okay, now just move
your glasses
down on... onto the nose...
A little bit further,
just a little bit,
a touch further.
Keep your head down,
but look up at me.
Look sort of moody.
Yeah! That's beautiful!
That is great!
Okay, turn the keyboard
on live!
Do you wanna hear
the keyboard then?
You don't have to
bite your lip now.
Well, actually
play something.
Play something.
You know? Anything.
You're a pianist,
aren't you?
Play something.
That's great,
that's beautiful.
That's lovely.
Oh, that's good.
No, don't stop.
Keep playing.
Go on, just keep playing.
That was great!
...shoot myself
in the head.
She's not even good.
That whole
window thing...
Yeah, what was
that shit with the window?
Oh, my god!
Don't quit your day job.
Oh, well...
Not good. One-woman shows
are always terrible.
Mia!
Mia. I'm so sorry.
Just tell me
how it went.
How was it?
Don't help me.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I've been
such a prick.
You're sorry,
you're sorry...
You're sorry.
I'm gonna
make it up to you.
Let me make it
up to you, okay?
I don't blame you
for not wanting...
It's over.
What is?
It's over.
What?
All of this.
I'm done embarrassing myself.
I'm done. I'm done.
Nobody showed up.
So what? So what?
I can't pay back
the theater. This is so...
I'm gonna go home
for a while.
I'll come
see you tomorrow.
No, I'm going
"home" home.
This is home.
No, it's not anymore.
Yep?
<i> Hi, I'm trying</i>
<i> to reach Mia Dolan.</i>
Wrong number.
<i> She's not answering her cell.</i>
<i> I was told</i>
<i> I might find her here.</i>
Not anymore.
<i> Okay, well,</i>
<i> if you do talk to her...</i>
I won't.
<i> ...could you tell her Jane</i>
<i> at Amy Brandt casting</i>
<i> is trying to reach her?</i>
Casting?
Who the hell is that?
Shut that
thing off!
<i> Why did you come here?</i>
Because I have
good news.
What?
Amy Brandt,
the casting director...
Yeah.
She was at your play,
and she loved it.
And she loved it so much
that she wants you
to come in tomorrow
and audition
for this huge movie
that she's got.
I'm not going to that.
I'm not going to that.
What?
That one's gonna be...
No. That one's gonna be...
I'm sorry?
That will kill me.
What?
What?
What? Shh! Stop!
No!
You have to be quiet.
We're in a neighborhood.
If you want me to be quiet,
you have to make
some goddamn sense!
Tell me why
you're not going.
They'll call the police.
Because...
Why?
I've been to
a million auditions,
and the same thing
happens every time
where I get interrupted
because someone
wants to get a sandwich!
Or I'm crying,
and they start laughing!
Or there's people
sitting in the waiting room,
and they're like me but
prettier and better at the...
Because maybe
I'm not good enough!
Yes, you are.
No...
No, maybe I'm not.
Yes, you are.
Maybe I'm not.
You are.
Maybe I'm not.
You are.
Maybe I'm one of those people
that has always
wanted to do it,
but it's like a pipe dream
for me. You know?
And then, you said it,
you change your dreams,
and then you grow up.
Maybe I'm one of those people,
and I'm not supposed to.
And I can go back to school,
and I can find
something else
I'm supposed to do.
'Cause I left to do that,
and it's been six years,
and I don't want
to do it anymore.
Why?
Why what?
Why don't you want
to do it anymore?
'Cause I think it hurts
a little bit too much.
You're a baby.
I'm not a baby.
I'm trying to grow up.
- You're crying like a baby.
- Oh, my god.
You have an audition
tomorrow at 5:30.
I'll be out front
at 8:00 A.M.
You'll be out front
or not, I don't know.
How'd you find me here?
The house
in front of the library.
I got coffee.
Okay, great.
Mia?
Hi, Mia. I'm Amy
and this is frank.
Hi. How are ya?
Nice to meet you.
Glad we found you.
Me, too.
The film shoots in Paris,
and we don't have a script.
It's gonna be a process.
We're gonna
build the character
around the actress.
It's a 3-month rehearsal
and a 4-month shoot.
Okay.
And we thought that you
could just tell us a story.
About?
You can just
tell us anything.
Anything?
Yeah, just tell us a story.
You're a storyteller.
Um...
Whenever
you're ready.
My aunt
used to live in Paris.
I remember she used to come
home and she would tell us
these stories
about being abroad, and
I remember
she told us that she jumped
into the river once.
When do you find out?
Oh, they said
the next couple days.
But I'm not expecting
to find anything out.
You're gonna get it.
I really might not.
Yes, you are.
I hope you're
not disappointed.
I know.
I know.
I know these things.
Where are we?
Griffith park.
Where
are we?
I know.
I don't know.
What do we do?
I don't think
we can do anything,
'cause when you get this...
If I get this.
When you get this,
you gotta give it
everything you got.
Everything.
It's your dream.
What are you gonna do?
I gotta follow
my own plan, you know?
Stay here
and get my own thing goin'.
You're gonna be in Paris.
Good jazz there.
And you love jazz now.
Right?
Yes.
And I guess
we're just gonna
have to wait and see.
I'm always gonna love you.
I'm always gonna
love you, too.
Look at this view!
I've seen better.
It's the worst.
Yeah.
I've never been here
during the day.
Hi. Could I have two
iced coffees, please?
Right.
Of course.
On us.
Oh, no, thank you,
i insist.
Sounds good.
Harris did a good job.
Took him long enough.
It always does.
Signature time.
Not doin'
too bad, seb.
"Not too bad" is great.
See ya tonight.
See ya tonight.
Hi.
How was your day?
Good.
Hmm. How is she?
She's great.
Yeah?
Yeah, come on.
Hi, buddy!
I didn't think
you were gonna
be home yet.
Are you drawing?
Yeah.
Can I help?
You know
i love to draw.
<i> Okay, Chelsea,</i>
<i> we're gonna go.</i>
<i> Are you good?</i>
We're good.
You need anything?
Bye, baby.
Say "bye, mommy."
Sleep well.
Bye, mommy.
Have
fun with Chelsea.
Have fun.
Bye, Mia.
Bye. Thank
you so much.
Good night, guys.
Night, sweetie.
Good night.
Oh, boy.
What if we miss this?
What do you
wanna tell Natalie?
Oh...
We'll just see it
back in New York.
Okay.
I do not miss this.
This is bad.
Do you want to just
pull off here and get dinner?
Sure, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Okay.
Do you want to
