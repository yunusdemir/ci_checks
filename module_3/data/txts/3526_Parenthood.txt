I need you to back me up
on that. We're a team.
Thanks for spending time
with him.
I love him.
He's my grandson.
You don't like how
I'm directing the play,
you spice it up
however you like.
Joel, I'm begging you, man.
You've gotta come back.
If you don't, this play's
gonna be the biggest disaster
in California since
the earthquake in 1905.
Our most talented director
is back from vacation.
Joel!
[Cheers and applause]
- Alex.
- Adam Braverm.
Nice to meet you,
Mr. Braverman.
What'd they think about me?
Did I pass?
- They loved you.
- It's best if you don't
see Alex anymore.
[Vibrating]
Hey, Alex.
I'm just picking up
the last donation for the day,
and the truck doesn't have
to be back for a couple hours.
You want to get some food?
- You mean, like, now?
- Yeah, now.
I'm, like, five minutes
from your house.
I'm starving.
I haven't eaten
anything all day.
Hello?
Haddie, you there?
Just give me ten minutes.
I'm not really dressed.
You don't have to be dressed.
Just throw some sweats on.
I really want to see you.
I miss you.
And I heard this is
a really good movie.
All right, haddie,
we're out of here.
Okay, bye. Have fun.
Um, okay, yeah.
I'll see you in a few minutes.
All: ♪ now that we have
struck it rich ♪
♪ we should keep in mind ♪
that's you, buddy.
I can't see.
That's okay,
you just say the line.
I can't.
I forgot it.
Okay. Charles,
can we cut that?
What do you think?
All right, I'll talk to him.
- All right.
- Hey, buddy, come here.
Hey, what's going on?
We've done this,
like, 100 times.
But we never had
a light before.
Oh, well, that's part
of the dress rehearsal, buddy.
See, we can see
how it's actually gonna be
on the night of the show.
It hurts my eyes.
Listen, the spotlight's
really cool
'cause it lets us see
your big moment.
Yeah, super cool.
- You look awesome.
- Mm-hmm.
I don't want to do this
anymore.
Buddy, you don't have
to be scared of anything.
You're doing great,
and you just...
yeah, you keep on truckin'.
Could somebody else do it?
I will.
Buddy, you can't quit
right now.
The play is in two days.
I want to be with those guys.
You want to be with those guys?
Listen, we gotta...
we gotta keep going here.
Would it be all right
if we make the switch?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Okay, Syd,
get behind the curtain.
Jabbar, you're down there
in that empty space.
All right, guys, pick it up
where we left off.
- Mom, remember the fund-raiser
I had to do for baseball?
Uh...Yes.
Okay, well,
I kinda slacked off on it,
and now I have to
sell all of this by Friday.
And if I don't sell it,
I can't go to the tournament.
What is it?
It's, like, wrapping paper.
- Christmas stuff?
- Yeah, Christmas stuff.
Drew, that's insane.
It's January.
I know.
Why didn't you sell it
during the holidays?
Please, mom, look,
you're kickass at sales.
You're the only chance
I have at selling this.
- Honey, are you kidding me?
- Please.
Yeah, really, you can't
do this to your mother.
You can't do this to your son.
I can't go to the tournament
if I don't sell this.
Okay, we'll
figure something out.
I'll help you.
Thank you. Thank you.
I'll go get the other box.

Didn't you just leave?
Max forgot his gift card.
Why does that matter?
Why does it matter
that he forgot that?
- Are you going somewhere?
- No, I left my bag downstairs
and I needed to come get it.
I thought you had to study.
I do. I'm studying.
I'm taking a break.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't look like
you're taking a break.

- Yes, go mom!
- Thank God.
- Oh, great. Okay.
[Doorbell rings]
Who the hell is that?
I don't know.
I'll get it.

- You just go to the movies.
Hey. Tag, you're it. Let's go.
You're it. Come on.
- Haddie!
- Mr. Braverman.
Alex, what are you doing here?
Is there something wrong?
I think you should leave.
- Um, dad, Alex was just...
- Did I miss something?
Driving in the neighborhood.
- Uh-huh.
Just in the neighborhood.
Okay, listen, you two aren't
going anywhere together today.
You should leave.
Am I missing something?
Sir, I don't...
I'm sorry, I think
you should go and I'll call you,
and I'll explain it all.
- Alex!
- Max, please.
She's not gonna call you.
You're not calling anybody!
Just stop. Stop.
- You're something else.
- What?
I did not raise you
to be a liar and a sneak.
We talked about this, honey.
What is he doing here?
Why couldn't you come
and talk to us about this?
Why do you have to sneak around
behind our back?
You lied to us.
You weren't listening to me.
Now's not the time
to talk about it!
Get in the house. Just go.
- You're grounded.
- Go.

Hey, excuse me, would you like
to buy some paper?
Excuse me, miss, do you want...
hey, sir, how do you feel
about paper?
Sorry, I'm late for work.
Maybe say what kind of paper.
You know,
that it's wrapping paper.
I'm really bad at this.
You're not really bad at this.
- Yeah, I am.
- You just, um...
You know, try a little...
excuse me, miss.
Have you wrapped your presents
for Martin Luther King day yet?
No? Okay,
well, I have a dream
that this would make them
look super special.
Okay, what do you got?
- Oh...
- Oh, my...
well, we have reindeer.
Yes.
- Snowflakes.
- So it's Christmas paper.
Yeah.
It seems weird,
'cause you say to yourself,
"the holidays are over."
It's not that.
I'm Buddhist.
- Oh.
- I don't celebrate Christmas.
Oh...
If you had any Visakah puja,
I could help you out.
Sorry. Good luck.
Thanks.
They don't make
Visakah puja paper.
[Sighs]
I wish we could just do
what everyone else does.
Why?
What did everyone else do?
Well...No one else sells
any of this.
They just have their parents
buy it all.
I don't believe that.
They do. I promise.
Well, that's terrible.
Even if I had $500,
I wouldn't do that.
That's cheating.
Yeah. I guess.
Excuse me, sir,
do you want to...
would you like to buy

I'm so sorry.
They told you not
to see me, didn't they?
They're crazy, Alex.
They're...
they like you as a person.
They freaked out because,
you know, you're not in school,
and you live on your own and...
Black, right?
No. No, they're not racist.
I didn't come here
to defend them or anything,
but they're not racist.
They freaked out because
you're in aa.
They barely even know me,
haddie.
I know. That's exactly
what I've been telling them.
I've told them that 100 times.
You lied to me.
And you lied to them.
And when you did that,
you made me part of your lie.
You've been lying so much,
I don't even know which lie
we're talking about right now.
- I was gonna tell you.
- When were you gonna tell me?
I don't know, I...
please don't be mad at me.
Why wouldn't I be mad, haddie?
You know about the program!
You know how hard I work
to be an honest person,
and you just took that
away from me
without even thinking.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Look. Look at me.

Hey, haddie.
Aren't you supposed
to be in school?
You okay?
Come with me.
He just doesn't like me
anymore.
Oh, of course he does.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know how to fix it.
I don't know how it happened.
I wasn't trying
to make it happen.
It's just like...
I don't know!
I hate my parents!
Your parents don't know
anything about Alex.
You know?
All they know about him
is that he's
a recovering alcoholic,
and he's older.
So you know. You know.
Well, of course I do,
but, sweetie,
I can't get between you
and your parents.
You know, they're doing
only what they think
is best for you, you know?
What am I supposed to do then?
I think you should just
let everything simmer down.
Just, you know...
just let everything quiet down.
He'll come around.
Are you kidding me?
I have to go to school?
Of course you do.

Do you ever feel
the butterflies?
Yeah.
Everyone does.

Uh, whenever I see your mom.

and cool,
she makes me nervous.
- Hey.
- And speak of the devil...
- Mommy!
- Hi, cutie pie.
- How was class?
- Good.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
What are you boys doing?
Daddy's telling me
about the butterflies.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I heard about that.
- Just butterflies.
- Do you ever get them?
Yeah, remember when I had
that big audition
for Alvin Ailey?
I had lots of butterflies then.
Remember, she took
all those deep breaths,
and was, like,
shaking her muscles out,
like...
[Panting]
That's not even how I do it.
Yeah, you look just like this.
- [Laughs]
- Don't you remember?
You look just like this.
That's what you look like.
So what's going on, jabbar?
You don't want to do
your part anymore?
No, but daddy wants me to.
I said that I would like him
to try it again, you know.
Look, you don't have to do it
if you don't want to.
It's okay.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Good.
Are you kidding me?
Just like that?
What?
It's a kindergarten play.
It's not a big deal.
Yeah, it's a big deal
if our kid becomes a quitter.
Our kid is not a quitter, okay?
I don't want to traumatize him.
Just let him have fun.
<i>Okay, he was having fun,</i>
and then he had
one little hiccup
during a dress rehearsal,
and now we're saying
throw in the towel.
You know how important
performing is to me, okay?
But if he chokes out there,
it'll kill me.
He doesn't need the pressure.
He's only six years old.
Look, just relax, baby.
Relax. Okay?
Sydney's gonna be great,
Jabbar's gonna have fun,
and you are going to be
a very, very, big hit.
It's all gonna be fine.
It's gonna be fine.
Haddie.
Your mother and I would like
to talk to you.
Okay.
Yeah?
Why did you miss
your first four classes today?
We got an email
from the school.
Yeah. You can read it
if you want.
- No, I'm fine. Thanks.
- Where were you?
Answer your mother.
- I'm about to.
- Just tell us the truth.
Okay. I want to
tell you the truth.
We're listening.
Great. Um, I was
at the food bank, seeing Alex.
- Unbelievable.
- He hates me because
you guys told me that I couldn't
see him, and so I had to lie.
What part of being grounded
didn't you understand?
Stop treating me like a baby!
Then don't behave like one.
You know what, fine.
I'm not going to.
And I'm gonna do
whatever I want.
I get to make decisions,
and I'm gonna see Alex,
and you don't get to say
anything about it!
- Really?
- That's right, go to your room.
And I want that cell phone.
Do you want my soul too?
You know what, you're being
real smart right now.
- Haddie, I want...
- I hate you!
I'm not handy Bob here.
Kristina, just take this.
Just take that, okay?
- Watch the point, honey.
- I got it. I got it.
What are you doing?
What does it look like
we're doing?
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.
When you regain our trust,
you can have your door back.
- Absolutely.
- I don't...
where am I supposed to change?
- Bathroom down the hall.
- Right over there.
- Why not?
- You guys have gone crazy.
<i>This is absubehavior.</i>
No, no, no, we're not crazy.
What's crazy is you
lying to your parents
and sneaking around
behind our back.
So no longer are you
just grounded...
You're so grounded.
No screens, nothing.
- No cell phone, no tv.
- What?
No laptop... you've given up
your right to privacy.
How am I supposed
to do my homework?
There is a desktop downstairs
you can do it on.
- You'll figure it out.
- Absolutely.
Listen to yourselves!
I met a person who I like,
so I'm super-grounded
and I don't get to have a door?
I don't get it.
This does not have
to do with that.
This has to do with trust.
- What?
- Exactly.
<i>You have no legitimate reasons
for anything!</i>
Oh, honey, don't drag it.
No, it just doesn't look nice.
- Oh, my gosh.
- Hi, everybody.
Oops. Ow.
Oh, I broke a nail.
This is my son drew,
and he's selling
some wrapping paper...
holiday-themed...
at a wonderful discount.
It's for his baseball team.
Eddie, remember when I bought
all those thin mints
from your daughter?
Payback.
You did. But you know,
you didn't buy 'em.
No, I had 'em with my coffee.
You did, but you promised
to buy 'em.
Oh, right. I, uh... I...
oh, okay, I'm gonna...
well, anyway,
um, my son...
oh, Cory!
Hey. This is
my son drew.
Drew, this is my new boss Cory.
[Knocking on window]
- Hey.
- Hi. Huh?
Um, this is my son drew,
and he's, uh,
selling stuff
for his baseball team.
You like to wrap?
Like freestyling?
Hey, how you doing?
What's up, Cory?
What up, dude?
- What's up, my man?
- It's getting better.
Hey, can I see you
up in my office real quick?
- Why are you going so fast?
- Seriously?
- What?
- Look, can we not have
the, you know, gift wrap
fund-raising parade
coming through
the lunch area, please?
You've gotta be kidding me.
Ben's son sold magazines
a week ago.
Yeah, I know, but that was...
Gordon was here,
and Gordon was never here.
Don't talk about him.
But this guy is unpredictable,
and I don't know where
I stand with him, okay?
And I don't need anybody
rocking the boat.
Okay, I'm not rocking the boat.
I'm just trying to help my son.
All right, all right.
I'm sorry, okay.
I'm just... I'm under a lot
of pressure lately and...
- why?
- This work situation,
and Haddie's got stuff
going on.
- What?
- She's got this boyfriend.
It's not her boyfriend,
but it's complicated.
- Oh.
- Kristina and I don't approve.
What, the kid
from the soup kitchen?
Yeah, well, he's not
a kid, okay. He's 19.
He's got his own apartment.
He's in aa.
It's a complicated situation.
Can I get his number?
I'm kidding. It's awful.
No, he's too old for her.
You're right.
Hey, that Cory guy
gave me 40 bucks.
- You're kidding.
- He did? Great.
- How much did you sell him?
- Uh, none.
He just kinda felt bad for me.
Oh, he took pity on you?
Well, I guess it's only
$460 to go.
- All right...
- So kind and generous of him.
Oh, no, I wasn't even thinking...
Oh, look, I've got $47, okay?

- My bad. Sorry, Joel.
- Only for you, Zeek.
- He didn't know his lines?
- He knows his lines, okay.
He doesn't want to do it.
What do you mean,
he doesn't want to do it?
He can't quit.
I mean, he's a Braverman.
Braverman don't quit.
Yeah, well, maybe you should
tell that to Jasmine.
This is Jasmine's idea?
What the hell does she know?
I mean, come on.
Let me...
let me talk to him.
You're not gonna talk to him
because he doesn't want
to do it,
and she doesn't want
to push him.
So there's nothing
for you to say.
Well, how do you feel about it?
It doesn't matter
how I feel about it.
She's the mom.
What do you mean,
it doesn't matter
how you feel about it?
He's your son, Crosby... you gotta
have a say in this thing.
You're setting
a dangerous precedent here.
Who wears the pants
in the family?
What year do you think
this is, the '50s?
There's no one wearing the pants
or not wearing the pants.
You know?
It's a partnership.
God, that sounds dreadful.
Hey, kris.
Oh, my gosh, hi.
How are you?
Nice surprise.
Yeah, I just...
I thought I'd pop in.
I want to talk to you
about haddie.
You know this boy Alex, right?
He works at the food bank.
- Yeah, I know him really well.
- Okay.
You know, I've been working
at the center for a long time.
I've known him since
he was about nine.
- Yeah.
- You know?
He's really a good kid.
He's, I'm sure, great,
but he's not really a kid.
He's 19.
Well...Okay.
Anyway, that's the trouble
we're having.
She... she thinks that
she's in love with him,
and she wants to date him.
And Adam and I told her that
it's completely inappropriate.
Well, she told me all about it.
- Who?
- Haddie. Yesterday.
- You saw her yesterday?
- When I drove her to school.
She didn't tell you?
She didn't tell me anything.
Oh, gee, I just assumed
that she did.
- No, she didn't.
- It was just...
she was really...
she was really upset.
There was a lot of drama,
a lot of tears
on the way to school.
And, you know, typical,
usual stuff for girls this age.
But I tried to work through it
with her.
That's great.
That's wonderful.
She feels really comfortable
confiding in you,
more than her own mother.
Oh, well...
I'm sorry, I just...
I can't...
Krissy, you know, sometimes
young girls feel
more comfortable
talking to someone
who's not their mother.
And, of course, when you tell
a teenage girl
that she can't have something,
she's gonna want it even more.
I mean, you know that.
Right.
So what you're saying is,
basically,
that Adam and I are making
a mistake
by not letting her date
a 19-year-old
recovering alcoholic
that lives alone...
no, no, no. That's exactly...
That's not what I'm saying.
That's exactly
what you're saying.
I'm so stupid that
I even came over here.
That's not what I'm say...
kris...
You could have called, Camille.
Kris, come on.
Krissy...
[Car door shuts]
That's not what happened.
I'm just finishing up here
at work, all right?
Almost done, okay?
[Knock on door]
I tell you what,
I'll meet you there. Okay?
Alex.
Mr. braverman.
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.
I didn't mean to
pop up on you like this,
but do you have a minute
to talk?
Sure. Come on in.
Have a seat.
It's a nice place.
Thank you.
You're, like, the boss...
Right?
Yeah, yeah,
I'm, like, the boss.
I didn't know you and your wife
told haddie
she couldn't see me.
If I had known,
I wouldn't have seen her.
I appreciate that.
And my wife will
appreciate that.
'Cause I work really hard
to be 100% honest with my life,
especially with other people.
To be honest to myself.
And I understand you
and Mrs. braverman think
I'm not good enough
for your daughter.
That is not the case.
I don't know...
I'm not trying
to change your mind, sir.
But whatever bogeyman
you think I am...
I'm not that guy.
Not anymore.
You came here to my office.
You're talking to me
like a man...I appreciate that.
It's not that I don't think
you're good enough
for my daughter.
It's that haddie
will be an adult,
dealing with adult things
for most of her life.
But right now, she's 16,
and her mother and I want her
to be 16
without rushing into adulthood
for as long as she can.
You know where I'm coming from?
I get it.
I wonder how I would have
turned out
if I had parents like you.
You're a good dad,
Mr. braverman.
Thank you.
Thank you for your time.
Alex...
I wish you'd had someone who...
Cared for you that way
when you were a kid.
You deserve that.
Haddie was the closest thing
I've had to family
in a really long time, sir.
It's felt good.
But listen, I have Lily's dad
on the other line.
Can I call you back?
Okay, thanks.
Hey, Dan. So listen,
there is room on the side
of the stage for a tripod,
and we would love
to have video, so...
Well, actually, Jabbar's not
gonna be featured in it anymore.
He's just in the choir, so...
Yeah. Okay.
Let's go, buddy.
Time for school.
- Okay, mommy.
- All right.
I'll see you down there.
- So big day.
- Yeah, big day's here.
Everyone's fired up.
Good.
Everyone but our son,
who's brushing his teeth
like it's any old day.
I know you're disappointed,
but it doesn't
take anything away
from what you're accomplishing
for the school.
Yeah, the only person
it takes away from
is our son.
All right.
We've been over this
already, Crosby.
You know what,
he has two parents, okay?
I'm 50%, and you're 50%.
But for some reason, you act
like the Captain all the time,
and I'm the first mate.
I want my vote counted.
This has nothing to do
with anyone getting their way.
<i>It's about jabbar.
That is what it's about!</i>
You don't even factor in
what my opinion is, okay?
He's a natural, all right.
He's a ham, just like you.
And if we give him an out
right now,
we're sending a message that
we don't think he can do it.
I just don't want you
to push him into doing something
that he's uncomfortable with.
Like I'm gonna make him
uncomfortable?
I'm not gonna make my son
uncomfortable.
I want to take another shot
at getting him
to change his mind.
All right?
Fine. Fine.
But don't come to me
for the therapy bills
when he's damaged for life.
All right, well,
I'm not gonna be
sending him to therapy, so...
- Hey.
- Hi.
Yeah, well, we're all
gonna go to the play
in the car together.
- Okay.
- Is that what you're wearing?
Yes, dad, this is
what I'm wearing.
Okay.
What are you doing?
I'm counting my tips.
It's fun.
How come?
Because drew had
this assignment for school
where he had to raise $500
so he can play
in the baseball tournament.
He had to sell
this wrapping paper,
he didn't sell it, and...
How much is he short?
- Over $300.
- Oh, my gosh.
And you want to bail him out.
Oh, I'd love to be able to,
but that's just not gonna
happen.
Not gonna happen.
I don't know, Sarah.
I think you're doing
the right thing.
I mean, you've gotta teach him
how to stand
on his own two feet.
I mean, any moron can
bail their kids out, you know.
These kids have been standing
on their own two feet
since the day they were born.
What I'd like to do is...
Be the moron.
Right.
Guess that's not
gonna happen, huh?
I guess not.
Okay, well, thank you.
Hey, listen, uh...
I wanted to tell you
you're late with your rent.
I don't pay rent.
Really?
Well, you should pay rent.
I don't know how that happened.
I'll go ahead and shut this.
[Door shuts]
Curtain is in 30 minutes,
so the house is open.
That means we have to be
very quiet.
So inside voices, okay?
Hey.
Hey...Jabbar.
You can do this.
But mommy said I don't have to.
Yeah, you're right.
But we talked, and...
Both daddy and mommy think
that you should give it a try.
You can do it.
Give me your hands.
Feel that?
We can't be with you onstage,
but we're gonna be
right there, all right?
And so is everyone
who loves you.
So I want you to picture
that all of us are
holding your hand
through the air.
But I only have two hands, dad.
We'll be holding your hand
in spirit, honey.
When you do this, you're gonna
be so proud of yourself.
It's gonna feel so good,
I promise.
What do you say?
- Okay.
- Okay, that's my boy!
Okay, do you remember
your line?
- Uh-huh.
- Okay, good.
- Costume?
- Um, yes.
Just over there.
Okay.
Is Sydney gonna
play the part too?
Hey.
- Hey.
- I just want to tell you
that I'm not gonna be able
to help you
with the wrapping paper thing.
- Seriously, it's okay.
- No, I know it's okay.
But I just want to tell you,
someday I hope to be
the kind of mom who can
frivolously
throw buckets of money
for my child's
procrastination problems.
But today is not that day,
and I'm sorry.
Well, I sold it all.
- No.
- Yeah.
What?
Who would buy it?
- Some guy bought all of it.
- Really?
Yeah. They probably
just felt bad for me, but...
- Oh, I'm so relieved.
- So we're off the hook.
Well, you can play
in your tournament.
- Yes.
- Look at you.
It's 'cause of that face.
It's 'cause of
your little nosey,
little mouth...
so cute.
Who could say no to that?
I don't know.
Listen, I'm glad, but next
year, you start early, okay.
Let's not procrastinate.
Let's, like, get on it,
like, in July.
Because if people will buy it
in January,
just imagine how much
we could sell it in the summer.
You know what I mean?
That's true. Yeah.
We could start, like, a whole
craze... like, ooh, plan early.
Okay, hon, listen,
you really stepped up
back there, you know.
Jabbar was scared,
and you really helped him out.
But he's not scared anymore,
and he would like to play
the gold miner part.
So...
<i>If I give him the part back,
what do I get?</i>
Syd, it doesn't work
like that. You just...
no, no, no, no, no.
I will play...
I will play hardball.
I tell you what,
how 'bout I pick you up
on Saturday
and take you to any movie
you want to see, pg or under?
- You don't have to do that.
- Do I get popcorn?
- Yeah, all you can eat.
- And candy?
Oh, wow. She certainly is
Julia's daughter.
Isn't she?
- Yeah, all-you-can-eat
popcorn and candy.
Deal. Pleasure
doing business with you.
The pleasure was all mine.
And I don't get why
if haddie doesn't have to go,
I still do.
It just does not seem
like justice.
This play is about
the history of California.
You love history.
No, I don't love history.
I'm good at history.
I don't like it at all.
I like math.
Hey, kris.
Hey, Cammy.
- Now, cut that out.
- Cut what out?
The thing with your arms
that you do.
When you get mad, you do that.
[Scoffs]
I'm not mad. Why would I be mad?
I'm not mad.
I was just a little chilly.
I should have called you.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
- I thought it was handled.
- It's handled, okay?
And we would really
appreciate it
if you would support us.
- Hey, honey.
- Hey, mom.
Listen, honey,
I'm sorry I'm late.
Just... where are the kids?
Max is over there sitting down,
and haddie is in the car.
She doesn't want to come in.
- Why?
- She's pouting.
Honey, that's unacceptable.
- I know, but she doesn't...
- I'm gonna go get her.
She's pouting. Don't bother.
The show's about to start.
Forget it. Believe me.
Okay. All right.
Ladies, how are you?
Very well, thank you, sir.

I heard about
the whole Alex battle.
I can't say that I'm
a million percent on board
because the aa thing
makes me really nervous.
But I know that
I've said that already.
I know you obviously
really like him a lot,
so I'm gonna help you.
[Telephone rings]
- Hello?
- Alex, hey, it's Amber.
Haddie's cousin.
Hey.
Um, how's she doing?
She's okay.
Listen, um,
I just wanted to talk to you
because I heard that
you aren't speaking to her.
Just sounds to me, like,
the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.
She's obviously doing
this thing with her parents
because of you.
She's doing it so that
your feelings don't get hurt.
So it's just a little
confusing to me
that you're not talking to her
when she's just trying
to help you.
She needs you,
you know what I mean?
So it just kind of sucks.
And if you blow this,
you're the stupidest
person ever
'cause she's the most
incredible person that exists.
Aren't you
the thoughtful cousin.
I have my moments.
Yeah, but it's a little
more complicated than that.
There's a lot
I need to think about.
That's annoying.
She'll be at this phone number
for the next 45 minutes,
and then you're on your own.
Bye.

to present
the history of California.

- Haddie?
- Yeah?
- Your cousin is pretty bold.
I mean, yeah, you have no idea.
All right, look,
I'm just gonna say this.
After everything
went down with you,
I had to call my sponsor.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.
I'm fine.
He told me in the beginning
I shouldn't have a relationship
for the first year,
and now I know why.
I feel terrible.
No, I don't want you
to feel bad.
I care about you a whole lot,
but if things are gonna
work out between us,
you gotta make things right
with your folks.
Their minds are made up.
I don't know, this is
really just unfair.
It is unfair.
It is what it is, though.
