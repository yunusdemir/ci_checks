Help me find my mama!
Thank you so much for answering.
I didn't know who else to call.

The guy I dealt with
at the embassy was insane.
Emily, we're gonna
get you through this.
<i>But Barb wants me
to let you know one thing.</i>
She refuses to use
sexual humiliation
as an interrogation technique.
What are you talking about?
Fine! She'll use it.
I don't care what she does.
Just can you help me?
<i>Meet us at

at 19 hours.
ROSS: We're trying to use
her cell signal
to narrow down their location.
Colombian military is setting
up a couple stingrays
in the region now.
We can have a unit ready
to go in by tomorrow.
<b><font color="#408080">JEFFREY:</font></b> Well,
we got a big problem
'cause that unit needed
to be there yesterday.
I told you to shut the fuck up!
Okay.
Go ahead, solider.
ROSS: We've got reports
coming in that puts them
about 50 miles
outside of Bogota.

<b><font color="#408080">MORGAN:</font></b> No!
Please!
Absolutely not!
I'll translate.

Thank fuck. Emily. Listen,
you've gotta help me, please.
We found him sitting at the bar,
chatting up another
pretty young girl.
It's a scam, Emily.
Yeah, so Barb waited
for him outside
smacked him in the back of the
head, threw him in the car
and here we are.
It's not a scam.
These women are crazy.
This whole fucking thing
is insane.
Crazy?
Oh, you wanna know crazy?
You remember
my platonic friend, Barb?
Oh, Barb!
We were supposed to go
to the Arizona Gem Show
but instead, I'm here,
fucking with you.
<b><font color="#808000">(CHOKING)</font></b>
You should know that Barb
spent her life in special ops.
Not that bullshit regular ops.
She's retired now
so she doesn't have her toolkit.
But she was able to
improvise a few things.
Which, I'm pretty sure,
will all be applied
to your dick hole area.
Esmeraldas!
She's in Esmeraldas.
It's, like,
an hour's drive from here.
We got a real Chatty Cathy here.
Give me a map. I can mark it
on the map for you.
Write it down.
You want to start here...
Barb is really upset
about this. She had plans.
Now this doesn't always
show up on Waze
but you be sure to take that one
because it's the quickest route
if you want to avoid traffic.
<b><font color="#408080">EMILY:</font></b> Okay.
Okay, let's go.
Listen, Emily.
Be sure you check all the rooms.
She'll probably be held
on the third floor.
One of the rooms in the back.
Do you have any loyalty
to the people who hired you?
Hey, Emily, can I just
say, <i>as</i> well, you...
Fuck, you look great.
Thank you.
I got a tapeworm.
Well, it's working for you.
Hey, listen!
Are we, uh...
Am I ever going to
see you again?
Well, I don't know.
I guess if you're, like,
in New York,
we could get a drink.
