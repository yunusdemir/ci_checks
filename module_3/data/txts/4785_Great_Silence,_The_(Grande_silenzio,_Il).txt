I surrender!
Don't kill me, Silence!
I quit being a bounty hunter.
I swear.
Damn you! My hands!
You ruined my hands!
Come!
Even dead those bounty hunters
give me the creeps.
You came just in time.
Take this.
Those bastards ambush everytime
we're in the valley getting some food.
They know we'd starve here
without the food
If we would defend ourselves the bounty
would rise and there's be a massacre.
At least you could thank me.
This guy almost shot you.
Your bullet was wasted, trust me.
This bastard couldn't have used
a gun without his thumb.
That's why Silence didn't kill him.
For the others it was self defense.
He knew they'd ambush him,
but he was faster.
Why someone else has to defend us?
We got guns.
Let's go into town and send those damn
bounty hunters to hell.
It's us or them.
At least there'll be an end to it.
Listen, my friends:
Many of us are innocent.
It's unfair
to have a price on our heads.
The new governor
promised amnesty to us.
You have to bear up a little longer.
- I give up.
I'll go into town.
I'd rather be captivated.
I'll surrender myself.
At least it's warm in jail.
Wait, I'll join you.
Me too.
They think they'll get amnesty in jail.
- If they make it that far.
Miguel!
Where is the lawyer, Mom?
- There he is.
I couldn't take any more.
I didn't tell the others.
But I followed your advice.
You are very smart
to trust in the law.
I'm glad you're helping me.
No... What are you doing?
Mom!
Miguel!
Miguel... my son!
You have to understand,
that's how we make a living.
I take him to the sheriff.
Luckily his face wasn't hit.
so you can still recognize him.
Come on, let's get the money Tigrero.
The money is all yours,
you did it all on your own.
I get the other two,
enough for all of us.
Beware!
They killed five of our men.
The amnesty
triggered a manhunt.
There's got to be an end
to bounty hunting.
Surely, Mr. Governor, but...
- What?
Bounty Hunters are people...
who act upon the law.
It's not easy to control
a big area like this.
It is for you, sheriff.
You're the second best shooter
in the state, aren't you?
Sure. Only because I avoided
to challenge the best.
Right. Citizens have to
believe in law and order again.
Put an end to the wild west.
Bounty hunters, outlaws and sheriffs
are united in a better world.
In a world in which...
Before an election a governor pardons
even the murderer of his president.
What do you mean, sheriff?
I don't quite understand.
Nothing. Just thinking out loud.
A good soldier doesn't think.
- Sure. Don't think, just act.
Let's go to Snow Hill...
Utah.
Enough! Please stop!
Believe me, Tigrero, I know nothing.
Tell me where I find him.
- I don't know him.
Of cause you do,
he was with you in the mountains.
I don't know where he is now.
I beg you, let me go!
I don't know him.
Stop!
Believe me, Tigrero!
I don't know anything!
Don't lie to me.
I'll find out anyway.
At the mill.
Out of town.
Where his wife lives.
He's armed.
Many thanks.
I'm the resurrection
and the life.
He who believes in me,
will never die. Amen.
You have to have patience if you're
waiting for the stagecoach.
It snowed a lot in the mountains.
So it'll be late.
Want some food
while you're waiting?
Thanks, I'll bring you some.
I know you, stranger.
You help the weak.
Your pistol avenges the innocent.
My son was innocent, too.
They shot him down
like so many others.
Avenge him, I beg you!
One of the murderers is gone,
but the other is still in town.
I can only offer Miguel's horse
for the life of this murderer.
Kill him, avenge my son!
You'll save other lifes.
Yes, I know.
Some get rewards up to 5000 Dollars.
My friend Tigrero
for example makes...
a lot of money.
But with this snow...
it's hard work.
I eat and eat
but I'm still freezing.
The doctor...
said it's probably my blood.
He wanted to examine me.
But I don't give my blood
to a doctor.
You're right, Charly.
That would bring bad luck.
Right.
Close the door I'm freezing!
Close the door, damn it!
Or you'll be cold, too...
cold forever. Do you hear me?
Close the door or I kill you.
Calm down, Charly.
He's a dangerous man.
I don't care, I shoot.
Close that damn door!
Close it...
What now, are we gonna arrest him?
- No, Charly drew first.
The stranger shot in self defense.
So the law can't touch him.
Maybe. But you have to draw
faster as the devil himself.
Maybe he was the devil.
You're wasting your time.
My husband's not here.
I know, but I won't risk
my life for 1000 Dollars.
When he sees you he'll be calm.
Take me to him.
I won't do that,
get out!
Come on, get a move on!
Come out if you love your wife!
Move!
I want you alive.
I'll get the bounty anyway.
What are you afraid of?
Surrender yourself!
Bastard.
Throw your gun
and put your hands up!
Now cover your ex-husband
with snow.
It will keep his body fresh.
You mustn't bury him
before I got the money.
Don't forget that?
He's worth quite a sum.
What times we're living in!
A black man is worth more
than a white man.
Help!
My husband has been murdered,
please help!
Boss... he's been brought in.
Pauline... my god, the poor soul!
You have to be strong.
- Don't cry!
Pollicut!
You bastard! You keep yourself
nice and warm, don't you?
While this poor soul
died because of you!
It's you, you bastard...
you that profits the most
from the bounty.
This man was an outlaw.
He didn't deserve better.
That doesn't count for Pauline.
She can have everything from me.
Son of a bitch!
She'd be better off
with a rabid dog!
Move!
Come on... move!
Move already.
Goddamn.
Get a move, come on!
Stupid horse!
Move!
I'm the new sheriff.
I don't have money.
Nada dinero!
If you kill me
you'll all hang.
Move and I'll shot you.
You can't kill me.
Your gun is frozen, sheriff.
We're experienced enough
to keep our weapons warm...
and we know how to use them.
Just move
and I'll bash your heads in!
Don't be afraid,
we don't want to kill you.
What do you want then?
- Your horse, sheriff.
Why? There are so many of you,
what use could just one horse be?
Beefsteak.
We can eat for one week.
You can move to my place.
- It's no use.
I just want one thing:
Revenge,
even at the cost of my own life.
There was a price on your
husband's head because of Pollicut.
He gave him no work
so he was forced to steal.
Maybe.
But the real murderer is Tigrero.
I want his life
for that of my husband.
There is one man
all the bounty hunters are afraid of.
They call him Silence...
Because he's accompanied by
silence and death.
We're late.
Hey! Stop!
Someone's there.
I'm the sheriff around here.
I have to get away from here.
I don't care where you're going to,
take me to Snow Hill.
That's not where we're going.
- I don't care!
Take me to Snow Hill! Quick!
I'm sorry,
but I have to go to Snow Hill.
It's very urgent.
I'm the new sheriff.
As if I haven't enough
problems already.
Now this damn cold!
I know what you think.
What am I doing here in the
middle of nowhere without a horse.
But... I had a horse.
Outlaws took it.
To eat it.
Change the horses,
quick.
If the blizzard catches us
we'll be stuck here.
Please give me a hand.
I'll buy you a drink.
I take the big one.
He's heavy!
Up you go!

Hey you!
That's no way to transport dead bodies.
There are rules.
I'm the new
sheriff of Snow Hill.
I noticed your star.
Though you look like you raise cattle.
But with your star you look
like a ranger who plays sheriff.

Who is this joker?
Tigrero. Better not get too acquainted
with him.
Thanks.
- You're welcome.
Wait.
I think I have to refresh
your memory.
Dead bodies may only be transported
in wood or metal coffins.
Article 15 in...
These are no ordinary dead bodies.
- No?
What kind of dead bodies are they?
Two outlaws I killed and
bring to Snow Hill.
I want to fetch the bounty
before they begin to rot.
Excuse me.
There are four on the poster.
Who are the ones on the roof?
the second and the third.
Another one is already in town.
He'll be buried once I have my money.
They are wanted dead or alive.
You prefer 'em dead I guess.
Alive they are expensive. That's why
there is the other option.
Furthermore it would be dangerous.
Those outlaws are against god,
our moral, law and order.
They deserve to die.
Stop, please!
What's the matter?
I have another dead body.
Help me, I can't do it alone.
- What's he doing now?
Come here, please!
Get him up!
I killed him two days ago.
The snow conserved him.
He's only worth 500 Dollars,
but that's better than nothing.
Well, money is money.
You have to prepare for retirement.
Who knows if you're gonna live that long.
Some day you might meet someone
who draws faster than you.
That will be a day of joy.
Really.
Come here, the stagecoach arrived!
See you next time my friend.
I hope you'll be more talkative then.
Here's your saddle.
I thought Snow Hill
would be bigger.
If it snows on like this
it'll be even smaller tomorrow.
That man there with the horse...
I want to know where he goes.
- OK.
Don't let your retirement money
lie there in the street.
Either bury them
or take them home, got that?
If you pay me now
they're all yours.
Mine? I don't need them.
Do you think I am the gravedigger?
I don't like your face
and your attitude.
So beware,
or you'll end like them.
Good evening, sheriff.
Welcome in Snow Hill.
I see you are able to command
respect for yourself.
And who the hell are you?
You didn't guess it yet?
I'm Edwin Pollicut.
This is my store.
They must have told you about myself.
I'm afraid not. Are you that important?
What else do you do besides the store?
I'm the magistrate.
We will work together.
Shall we finish the deal?
You pay me the bounty and we're done.
I'm done already.
Come to my office tomorrow
and put your corpses away now.
Yes, I wrote this.
Come in.
I thought you'd look different.
Of cause that's not important.
Have a seat.
I want you to kill a man.
How much do you want for this job?
Answer me at least.
Can't you talk?
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.
1000 Dollars. Who is it?
Tomorrow... or the day after tomorrow
I'll have the money.
I just need some time.
It's Tigrero, the bounty hunter.
He travelled with you in the stagecoach.
He killed my husband.
Also for 1000 Dollars.
No. If I shall kill him
you have to put a price on his head.
You don't do it for nothing.
It's for your own good.
He's an enemy of the bounty hunters.
I know him. A dreamer who wants
to make the world a better place with his gun.
His method is brilliant.
He draws second...
but shoots first.
But one day he'll die, too.
But he wants to kill you.
Pauline brought him here.
He wants to challenge you.
That means nothing to me.
That thumb-shooter...
won't kill me in self defense.
Maybe he has come to get you.
You should catch yourself
that beautiful black girl now, idiot.
I got rid of her husband.
What more do you want?
If you need a killer
ask your servant.
Tomorrow a few collegues of mine
will arrive.
You can stay here tonight.
So nobody will see you around.
There's a bed near the stairs.
Good night.
Proof you're innocent.
Don't take the law into your own hands.
For your son's sake!
Gordon, get out. It's the sheriff.
Resistance is fertile.
You're better off in jail.
Or we'll give you a lead treatment.
There's a price on your head.
Surrender yourself.
Throw away your gun!
A good lawywer
will proof you're innocent.
Alright, sheriff, I surrender.
Mom! Mom!
The boy betrayed us.
No.
He'll never talk again.
First the corpses, then the money,
that's the regulations.
Because the law
needs proper proof,
Tigrero always has the wanted poster
with the dead body.
Everything done by the books.
That may well be.
But why do you care?
You only have to lend me the money
so I can pay him.
True, but I'll get 25% of the sum
A little income
provided by the state.
That's the law.
As well as a prompt payment
or am I wrong?
Pay him for all I care.
And get rid of the dead bodies!
They start to smell.
That would be...
two for 500...
and two for 1000.
That's 3000 altogether.
There are only three outside
so why to you pay him four?
Why four?
- because there are... four of them.
I only see three.
I left the black man here
but his wife buried him.
Everybody in town knows it.
- Yes, it's true.
That's not according to regulations.
First the corpses, then the money,
didn't you say so?
I'll see into it and
confiscate the money.
I'll have to hear the widow
and start investigating.
After that I'll write
a letter to the governor.
He'll see that it reaches
the right office.
That's the way you like it, right??
All done by the books.
It's cold, isn't it?
If the weather goes on like this
you better go back to africa.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.
Oh... Pauline.
What can I do for you?
You want to buy something?
I don't want to buy,
I want to sell.
Sell what?
- My house.
It's worth at least 5000 Dollar.
You can have it for 1000.
You like a good bargain.
Follow me.
Take care of the store.
- Ok, boss.
May I ask what you need the money for?
- No.
No problem.
I think I know anyway.
Murderers are expensive.
- None of your concern.
Are you interested in my offer?
No, Pauline.
I'm not how you think I am.
I won't take advantage of your misery.
No... I'd like to help.
Go to hell.
Not bad my friend.
But still could be better.
How's that?
Oh yes, I heard about it.
A kind of machine-gun.
But not very precise.
Very good. Too good.
I wonder what kind of business
a gunman like you has here.
You're not one of those
dirty bounty hunters?
I asked you something.
I'm the sheriff so you better answer me.
Who are you? Where are you from?
How long are you staying?
Don't try to get smart with me.
Are you going to answer me now?
He can't,
he's mute.
You could have at least said so,
I mean...
showed it to me somehow.
Listen...
I'd like to know something.
They say you buried your husband.
After a bounty hunter shot him.
Well...
is it true?
- Yes.
What was his name?
- James Middleton.
No, the bounty hunter.
- Tigrero.
20 and another 20.
- I pass.
Corner Straight.
- Well done.
Ok, Revanche!
Let's double the ante.
Of cause it's cold,
the oven went out.
Don't get all excited,
you won't win anything from me.
You promised us to get rich in Snow Hill.
But there's not even
the shadow of an outlaw here.
Relax, Schulz.
Hunger will drive those outlaws
into town.
It'll be so many
that you won't have enough bullets for them.
Such a cold!
Need a match?
- Thanks.
Greetings to you!
May I introduce my friends to you?
I don't care...
if this are your friends.
Here's your money.
How nice of you to come by
and give it to me personally.
I'm not nice, I want you to leave
this town quickly.
But that's not what I'm planing to do.
The air is fresh, I like the view.
And I like the sheriff
The view will change very soon.
And even the air will become thick
for you all.
Whiskey.
I didn't get the money.
But I still want my revenge.
That doesn't mean...
You have to do it for nothing.
There is someone
who would give me the money.
Even more than I need.
But he wants me to...
well...
I think you know what.
But that's too high a price.
But I'd pay you the price.
Now, before... after...
whenever you want.
I pass.
Always winning, Tigrero.
Eventually your friends will sit here
with only their pyjamas on.
But beware: maybe you'll be the one.
Having a pyjama made of wood.
Being in this dirty business
you have to be prepared for the worst.
Every profession
has its risks and its rules.
And you're going to
keep those rules, is that clear?
Otherwise I'll make those
wooden pyjamas for you.
Do you buy me a drink?
No, if I stay any longer
I have to puke.
Let's go outside then.
- Yes.
I open.
- I'm in.
200.
I raise to 300.
- I stay.
Ok.
Me too.
I stay.
Once more.
How many cards?
Two please.
I'll take three.
Two for me.
Two cards.
One for me.
200 Dollars.
I'm out.
- Me too.
300 and we have a game.
I pass.
Me too.
500 Dollars.
Listen, mute, you hope
that I draw first, am I right?
This is your method, I know.
But it won't work with me.
If someone draws first it's you.
Don't count on me.
On the contrary.
Since I don't want to take a risk...
Jack will take off my belt.
I really think...
that the day of joy has come.
I hope I didn't hurt you.
You are under arrest, Tigrero.
Without me you would have fired.
You can't keep me here.
- I know you.
Can't I be released on bail?
- It's 100 Dollars.
My money is in the saloon.
Also the 3000 Dollars from you.
It's not yours anymore.
It's confiscated.
Give me the money.
I'd give you 2000.
Very well. Now you tried to bribe me.
So bail is now 5000 Dollars.
You don't like me killing outlaws.
But you do the same.
That's different.
I act on the law.
How come?
- It's not murder it's punishment.
Killing outlaws shouldn't be
a business but a warning.
Amen.
- Shut up!
Sheriff, these are Tigreros things.
This money was in the saloon.
Thanks.
That's very nice of you, Regine.
Would you drink... some coffee with me?
- Sure, I'll pour some.
A man like you should always
be served by a woman like myself.
You're really very kind.
It would be nice if you'd serve me
some coffee every once in a while.
Regine likes to serve men.
With her body she'd make a whole
regiment of sheriffs happy.
You don't talk like that to a lady.
I'm awfully sorry!
I demand the release of this man.
Why?
It's the wish of the citizens of
Snow Hill. I have a delegation.
What about bail?
- I'll pay.
Does his freedom mean so much to you?
In the mountains many outlaws
are waiting for an unconstitutional amnesty.
The bounty hunters protect the town.
To protect the town is my job.
- There's more to it.
One of the killed was Klaus Schulz.
His brother Bodo
is the best gunman in Nevada.
Bodo Schulz won't be satisfied
unless he's had his revenge.
In short, Sheriff:
If you don't release Tigrero
his friends will get to him,
and than...
all hell would break loose.
That's what you think.
Now listen carefully:
Nothing will happen at all.
Those outlaws you're afraid of
are just some hungry beggars.
Give them a carriage with food
and they won't do any harm.
About Bodo Schulz...
If he wants to get close to Tigrero
he'll have to come to Tonota.
That's where I'll transfer him.
Boss! The outlaws are coming.
The sheriff will transfer Tigrero.
Our hero threatens us with Bodo Schulz.
That's just a fairytale.
Bodo couldn't possibly know
they killed his brother.
But the outlaws?
They are on their way to the town.
Stupid talk. Do as I tell you
and nothing will happen.
Put all the food in a
carriage in front of the town.
A full stomach doesn't steal.
stay in your houses, understood?
Come on, let's go!
Unbelievable. Now criminals are treated
with bread.
When will law and reason rule
this town again?
The day you hang.
Is this bastard badly injured?
I think so.
He must have lost a lot of blood.
Let's hope he dies.
Where is he now?
- In the house of that black woman.
We're riding to slow.
You're mute friend could follow us
and shoot me from behind.
The mute is injured
and doesn't shoot from behind.
I'm worried though.
Let's ride on the other side.
alright. As long as I
get you to the prison in Tonota.
Look, sheriff.
The outlaws. Take off my handcuffs.
Quick!
I won't do that.
These people are just hungry.
Just smile at them.
Damn murderer!
Today my weapon's warm
and as you can see it works.
Listen my friends.
Soon you'll get amnesty.
Then you can go home.
Don't make any trouble.
Before the town
some food is waiting for you.
Go to Snow Hill and eat.
Just spare us our horses this time.
They would be hard to digest.
Is there really food?
- You have my word for it.
Let's get back, sheriff.
We could await them at the carriage
and shoot every single one of them.
One is not worth that much
but altogether they're a good deal.
I don't beat up a captive.
But if you continue talking like that
you force me to.
I really meant that.
You saved me and I wanted
to make up for it.
Listen.
One more word of you
and you'll regret it.
My husband was an honest man.
He was accused of stealing
because he wanted to care for me.
Pollicut put a price
on his head.
He hoped I'd become his mistress.
But he was wrong.
Pauline!
We are collecting food
for the outlaws.
Could you give us something?
I'll have a look.
Good. Take your time.
Greetings to Silence.
Just take all.
We don't like
people like you.
You want to get rid of the bounty?
- No, but crime.
America has to ruled by law
and not by violence.
You know, sheriff...
What?
I have to applaud
to your prophetic vision.
When you swing at the gallows
I'll applaud you.
I need a break.
- What for?
To take a shit.
But with...
Alright.
Thanks, sheriff.
Go... but be quick.
It was really very urgent.
I won't wait for long, understood?
So, Tigrero, ready?
- Please.
We're running late.
I want to cross the ice before dusk.
I don't like to travel at night.
Don't worry we'll make it.
Hands up, sheriff!
Tigrero, quit playing games!
You'll hang for murdering a sheriff.
I'm no fool!
You'll be buried under the ice,
and I'll continue to carry out
the only true law. The law of the strong.
Relax friends. Since when do
wolves feed on each other?
Hello Tigrero!
Who handcuffed you?
The most sympathetic sheriff
from the state.
Help me.
Ah... the sheriff of Snow Hill.
A dirty braggart.
He <i>was</i>.
Now he's no longer dirty.
I let him have a nice bath.
He didn't get out of the water.
May his soul rest in peace.
He couldn't swim.
Now <i>we</i> are the law in Snow Hill.
At least now
we can carry on with our work.
I have a great idea.
Absolutly legal.
I met the outlaws.
They are on their way to the town.
We just have to ambush them
and we get them all at once.
Someone else is waiting for us
in Snow Hill...
who you like to kill for sure:
The mute.
The thumb shooter.
If it involves a dead sheriff
I don't want to join.
Did you know that the mute
killed your brother?
Klaus?
He didn't... have time
to defend himself.
Let's go.
No!
Let go of me!
Coward!
No!
Look at this hand!
Remember?
It was a normal hand. Now it
can't hold a pistol anymore.
But for what I'm going to do
I don't need a pistol.
No! Help!
Help!
My dear!
Pauline!
Tigrero rode to town
with five other men.
They are looking for Silence.
Do you understand? You have to escape!
Save yourselves!
If they find you they kill you.
But he's wounded.
He can't move.
We have to hide him.
- I beg you, help me!
Tigrero!
The mute shot Pollicut.
He's in the house of the black woman.
Go there and kill him.
Avenge us.
Don't move, Tigrero!
One false move and I kill you!
Throw your gun, bitch, or I'll
send you to your beloved sheriff.
Disgusting coward,
you killed him!
You've all seen it,
she shot first.
Look for the mute,
he can't have gone far.
Quick!
You have to find them.
There's not a soul here.
Here neither.
We searched everything.
The house is empty.
We'll find him eventually.
The outlaws are here!
They're near the town.
Let's go! We'll take care
of the mute later!
I'll try to warn them.
You have to hide yourself here.
Let's go my friends! There is the food,
just like the sheriff promised.
Don't shoot!
If we want to catch the mute
we need them alive.
Surrender! You are surrounded!
Throw your weapons
or we'll kill you!
Let's go, move!
Quick!
Get down!
Your backs against the bar!
I want Silence to show up...
and deal with me.
If he kills me...
you're all free.
My friends have agreed.
My life for all the others.
Tell him! You know where he is.
I was too late.
I tried but...
Tigrero already captivated them.
They are still alive
but tied up like cattle.
Tigrero catched me
as I tried to escape.
He said he'll kill them all
if you don't show up.
But...
you mustn't go there.
It's a trap for sure.
You are wounded
and there's six of them.
Alone one is powerless...
against the violence.
Let us escape together.
I don't want them to kill you,
I love you.
What are you waiting for?
Let's go through with it.
Kill us all.
Silence won't come anyway.
Kill us, murderer!
He's here.
No!
You coward!
No, have mercy!
We don't want to die!
There is still the bounty to get.
We'll collect it later.
All according to the law.
After the massacre of Snow Hill in 1898
bounty hunters were condemned publicly
A memorial in Snow Hill
had the following inscription:
The boots of men may raise the dust
of this place for 1000 years.
But nothing can make the blood
of those poor victims disappear.
