It is with considerable difficulty
that I remember the original era of my being.
All of the events of that period
appear confused and indistinct.
A strange multiplicity
of sensations seized me.
And I saw, felt, heard
and smelled at the same time.
And it was indeed a long time
before I learned to distinguish
between the operations
of my various senses.
I remember a stronger light
pressed upon my nerves
so that I was obliged to shut my eyes.
Darkness then came over me
and troubled me.
But hardly had I felt this when
by opening my eyes as I now supposed
the light poured in upon me again.
Okay. Hold on.
So beautiful.
You're a miracle.
You're so beautiful.
It's okay. Don't be scared.
I don't think you can see.
Unless it's very close,
it takes a newborn days to master that.
He's alive.
He's conscious. He's conscious.
- Could this be muscle spasms?
- No, no.
Look at the way he looks at me, Victor.
Look at the way he looks at me.
He needs water.
I'm going to get you
a drink of water, yep.
Open. Ah...
Such trauma.
Get him up! Get him up!
He's alive!
He's alive!
It's okay.
Shh...
What?
Let me try him.
Try. Here.
Be careful. Careful.
Trusting that he has
the reflex of a newborn.
Yeah.
- Will you look at that.
- Wow!
Okay.
Very strong.
He's very strong.
Okay.
- We're not going to hurt you.
- Here we go.
I can't...
- It's amazing. He won't let me.
- Okay.
Okay.
Hey, get up.
- Okay, okay.
- This is it.
Treat him like a mama. Like a mama.
Yeah. Yeah.
Okay, you can do it.
Here we go.
Good, good. Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
Oh! Oh.
Yes, I know the mechanics.
That doesn't explain
how you finally did it.
I don't know, Dr. Marcus.
Quite honestly, I'm quite overwhelmed
by the immensity of it all.
- Oh, come on, Victor. Don't be so coy.
- I'm not being coy.
I want to know what the breakthrough was.
Well, it must have been something
quite wonderful. Brilliant.
- But this is something far too important...
- Simple.
...for you not to share
with the whole team, Victor.
Now, I already noticed
that some applications are out of control.
And what I was thinking was that maybe...
So what? It just means he'll heal faster.
Not necessarily.
Uncontrolled cell division...
I'm not interested in your analysis.
He's going to be healthier, stronger,
far, far more resilient.
Okay.
Administer the sedative.
Yes.
Look at you.
Well.
It's okay.
There you go. Good.
Yeah?
That's good.
Very good.
Okay, so...
Mmm. Yum, yum.
Okay?
Open your mouth.
Like this. Ah...
Ah...
- Ah.
- Now.
Ah.
Okay.
Ah... Mmm.
Yum, yum.
Okay?
Ready? Ah...
Ah...
Good. That's it.
Okay.
Do you like that? You want it?
Why don't you have that?
Mama.
Mom.
Peekaboo.
Good.
And back.
Brilliant.
- Whoa!
- Oh!
- Good boy.
- That's a good catch.
- Fuck!
- Here. You okay?
Yes.
It's okay. You didn't hurt me.
It's fine. It's okay.
Oh!
Okay. You can let go now.
You can let go. Let go.
Let go. Good boy. Good boy.
Yeah, I can see that, too.
We're going to have to do a biopsy.
Okay.
Okay.
Ready?
That's it. That's it.
I got it.
Yeah. Good.
Good. Good.
Oh, no.
I don't want to talk about it right now.
I'm sorry.
This is not what I intended.
He can hear you.
- He doesn't understand.
- Yes, he does.
Mom.
Look.
Dad.
They're just sounds. Crude sounds.
Babies make them
and we ascribe meaning into them.
Don't kid yourself.
- Dad.
- Don't justify.
He's a conscious entity.
We can't just put him down.
If we accept that he is conscious,
then the concept of
prolonging his agony is unacceptable.
We can't...
I can't have anything to do with this.
I can't. It's...
It'd be murder. I can't do it. I can't.
Murder?
Murder.
What was that?
He was never born. He does not exist.
Look at him, Victor.
Murder.
Do you think that he's in pain, Victor?
I don't know.
Are you in pain?
Okay.
It's okay. You're going to go home now.
I can't find a goddamn vein.
The pain is going to go away.
- Come on, Dr. Marcus.
- Wait a second.
Now then, what have we got here?
- That's all right. Leave it.
- All right.
You're doing really good.
Okay.
It's okay. It's okay. Did you get it?
No, not yet.
- Now.
- Okay.
Come on, Dr. Marcus.
- She is gonna fit.
- That's it.
- You did it.
- Okay.
You did it. This is good medicine.
Good. Good.
- Good.
- Rest, baby.
- Close your eyes. Just go to sleep.
- Start it.
Close your eyes.
That's good medicine.
Just relax and go to sleep.
Go to sleep.
Very good.
And go.
You ready?
Uh-huh.
- Yeah.
- Go.
One, two, three, four, five.
- Oh, my God.
- I'll do the rest. Hang on.
- Okay. Okay. Please!
- Clear out.
Oh, my God.
Okay.
Please, stop.
Stop! Do something!
I'm trying.
Yeah, fine.
Wait, wait.
Wait.
That's it.
- You checked his pulse?
- Yeah, he's good.
Oh.
See? Victor fucked up.
I'll say.
Yeah. You can see
the cell replication issues.
And I think the circuitry issues as well.
Maybe next time he'll listen.
I want you there more. Seriously.
You know I want to be there.
Here we go. All right.
Hold on a second.
You got him?
Hey, give me a scalpel.
There's something wonderful going on.
These eyes, look at them.
Each one took six months to print.
Billions of microlayers.
I'm keeping these. Give me the scalpel.
Scalpel.
Wait, wait, wait.
Let me section the cranium.
That way you'll have
easier access to the eyeballs.
Good idea. Yes.
Get off.
Get the fuck off him! Fuck off!
Okay. All right.
No, no. That's dangerous.
That's... It's not a toy.
No, no, no.
No, no, no. Put it down.
Put that down. Put it down.
No, no. You don't want to do this.
No. I'm a doctor.
I can help you. Trust me.
No, no. Stop! Help!
Stop! Stop!
You...
You are magnificent.
You have the strength of 10 men.
You are the future, my child.
You're the future.
Dr. Marcus, please report
to Level 5 security. Thank you.
Hey!
Hey, you! Stop!
What the fuck is that?
Hey, stop! I said stop!
Stop! You! Get down!
Get down! Get down!
Lie down! Lie down!
Down.
Get down.
God damn it!
Hey, stop!
Here I lay, resting from my fatigue.
Until I felt tormented
by hunger and thirst.
This roused me
from my nearly dormant state.
I staked my thirst at the brook.
And then, lying down,
was overcome by sleep.
It was dark when I awoke.
I felt cold also.
And half frightened, as it were,
instinctively, finding myself so desolate.
I was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch.
I began to distinguish my sensations
from each other.
I gradually saw plainly
the clear stream that supplied me with drink.
And the trees,
they shaded me with their foliage.
I began also to observe with greater
accuracy the forms that surrounded me.
And to perceive the boundaries
of the radiant roof of the light
which canopied me.
One day, when I was pressed by cold
I found a fire
which had been left by someone.
I was overcome with delight
at the warmth I experienced from it.
In my joy, I thrust my hand
into the live embers,
but quickly drew it out again
with a cry of pain.
How strange, I thought.
That the same cause
should produce such opposite effects.
Hey, Tom. You see that?
Oh, yeah. Oh.
Come back.
Puppy, come here.
Down, boy.
Is this your dog, mister?
Can I pet him?
What's his name?
Are you hurt?
You should see a doctor.
Will you play sticks with me?
Come on.
Puppy's so cute.
Do you know how to play?
Now grab your stick and throw it in
when I count to three.
One, two, three.
See, I win. Again.
Okay, throw it in.
Grab your stick and throw.
No.
Help!
Help!
Just jump in there! Go get her!
Get out of the water.
Get out of the water now.
Hey, Officer. We saw it.
He throw her in there.
He's trying to drown her.
Sir, put the girl down.
Sir, I said put the girl down.
Stop right there and put the girl down, sir.
I'm not going to ask again.
- Hold it. Hold it, sir.
- Put the girl down.
- Sir!
- Step away with your hands up.
Sir, is this your dog?
Hang on. Hold.
Sir, is this your dog? Call your dog.
Sir. Sir, control your dog.
Control your dog!
All right, let's take him in, okay.
Sir, you're going to need to turn around
and put your hands behind your back.
- Easy does it. It's okay. That's it, that's it.
- Nice and easy.
- Nice and easy.
- Nice and calm. Here we go. Here we go.
Jesus. Get off him.
Stop it. You're hurting him.
Jesus, help me.
Mom, help me.
Mom.
Mom. Mom.
Mom. Mom.
- Come get it!
- Fuck you!
- Kill the guy.
- Yeah.
Fucking monster! You're a fucking monster!
Who are you?
I...
You must have a name.
Name.
Name.
Name. What's your name?
Name.
He seems to have
the mental capacity of a one-year-old.
Name.
Name.
What's your name?
Monster.
Monster.
Monster?
Your mom and dad call you monster?
Who is your mom?
We found this on you. Is this your mom?
- Mom!
- Easy... Hey, hey, hey
Okay.
Mom!
Mmm.
Mom!
Mom. Mom.
What's wrong with him?
Mom!
We'd rather hoped you'd tell us that.
I'm sorry. I'm not a medical doctor.
I'm a research scientist.
- You've never seen this man before.
- Mom! Mom! Mom!
It would be very hard to forget him.
Mom! Mom! Mom!
Mom! Mom!
Mom! Mom!
Mom! Mom! Mom!
Seriously, shut the fuck up.
Mom! Mom. Mom.
It's a fucking shame.
Yeah, man. Bob just bought
a house in Calabasas.
No shit.
Yo, what happens to the mortgage
in this kind of situation?
They give her
some sort of bereavement pay, right?
Yeah.
That ain't fucking shit, dude.
They act like they give a fuck about us.
They don't give a fuck.
You listening to this?
Fucking animal.
Oh... Does that hurt?
You fucking piece of shit!
Fuck you, animal!
- Yo, take it easy, Lenny.
- Fuck off, man.
You know Bob's face
was completely fucking smashed in?
Nothing left, man.
His fucking missus had to go down there
and identify that.
What the fuck is wrong with this thing?
A fucking freak show.
He's a fucking Mongoloid, man.
He's a freakin' Elephant Man.
But he doesn't know what's going on.
Fuck you!
God damn it. Would you relax?
I'm fine. I'm fine.
Just take a fucking breath.
Just calm down. It's all...
Everything's gonna be all right.
All right.
Let's just get this done.
He's a heavy motherfucker.
- Put him on his knees.
- Why?
I want him to see what's coming.
Now, come on. Get up. Get up.
Fuck you, you fucking scumbag.
Fuck you! Deserve to die.
Die.
What'd you say? You want to die?
- Die.
- You want to fucking die.
Shut the fuck up.
Come here. Come on.
Mom. Mom. Mom.
Mom? What the fuck are you saying?
Mom.
You want your mommy.
Oh.
Is that your mommy?
Is that your mommy? Is that what you want?
Here you go. Here you go.
There's your mommy. There's your mommy.
Fuck you, motherfucker.
You wanna go out?
Do you wanna go out, honey?
That's fucked up.
Everything, everything
Everything gonna be all right
This morning
When I was a young boy
About the age of five
My mama told me
I was gonna be the greatest man alive
I guess I am
A child
That represents man
No B
O Child
I need my soul
Who that?
Who that?
What's your name?
Huh?
Welcome, friend.
My name is Eddie.
- Eddie.
- Eddie Child.
Monster.
Well, it's nice
to meet you there, Monster.
Yeah. Are you a friend?
Hey, what is this? Oh, I see.
They done fitted you for one of them suits
down at the funny farm, huh?
Help. Mom. Jesus.
No, no, no. Hey now.
I ain't none of those, okay?
I mean, it seems like I've been fitted for
one of those suits once or twice in my life.
Yeah.
Huh?
Free at last.
Free at last.
You new in town?
Huh?
Huh?
You new to town?
Ah... Ah...
You can't talk.
Huh?
Oh, yo, I see. You can't...
You can't talk.
Well, I can't see.
It don't matter.
It seemed to me that you needed a friend.
Friend.
Friend.
You're a friend to me, my brother.
Yeah.
A child
That means maker
No B-O child
Y
That represent mannish boy
I led a miserable life in the strange
place where I found myself.
Endeavoring to cure the wound
which I'd received.
A bullet had entered my head
and I knew not whether it had
remained there or passed through.
At any rate, I had no means
of extracting it.
Monster. Monster.
Hey, hey. Is this red?
- Red.
- Red. It's yours.
Try it on.
Here we go.
Hey, hey, hey. Be careful. Be careful.
Okay, put it on.
Okay? Yeah. Huh?
You're not going to
scare away any customers, huh?
Yeah, a coat.
Coat.
Ah!
Shoes.
Shoes.
Music good, huh? Awesome.
I love the life
I love waking up
and smelling what I can't see
I can't see
How you feel about me?
I smell some perfume
so you must be going home soon
Let me know
when something pretty comes by.
Let me know when them tourists come by.
...in my mouth is ringing right back there
'Cause it's no joke to be a joke
Watch out for the scallywags.
Scallywags.
Scallywag.
Okay, are we okay?
I smell something. I smell something.
I improved rapidly
in the knowledge of language.
So that in a short while,
I began to comprehend most of the words
uttered by my protector.
Okay.
Check it, check, it, check it.
I smell a dumpster.
I smell a dumpster. Food. Food.
I smell a dumpster.
I smell it. I smell it.
Okay. Sometimes the restaurants, see,
they put out their leftovers and their waste.
- Dumpster.
- Dumpster. Dumpster.
Dumpster.
Yeah. Get anything good?
Huh?
Anything good?
Look for a box of food.
What? Anything good? Huh?
What the fuck is that?
What the fuck is that?
No. No. No. It's not good.
It's bad. It's very fucking bad.
One more. Yeah, vibrate good. Come on.
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.
Ah!
Mmm.
Now this is good.
- That's good.
- Good.
Good.
- Bad.
- You are the craziest motherfucker.
- Very fucking bad.
- Huh?
Hey, you smoke?
Smoke.
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.
It's a lighter for fire.
Careful. Careful.
Fire.
When I could see... I used to be...
I used to be, I used to be kind.
And then I was blind.
Sleep.
Sleep.
You want to go, motherfucker?
You want to break, bitch?
That boy's fucked up.
Oh, friend, friend.
I have available cars near 219
to transfer to Highland.
How's his state?
Stick an IV on him.
Yeah.
All right, what the fuck's going on here?
Looks like they were flung right across.
These aren't choirboys. Let's go.
The strange system
of human society was explained to me.
I saw the division of property
of immense wealth and squalid poverty,
of rank, descent, and noble blood.
Hey, Monster.
A man might be respected
with only one of these advantages.
I hope you're checking out them ladies.
But without either, he was considered
as a vagabond and a slave,
doomed to waste his powers
for the profits of the chosen few.
And what was I?
Of my creation and creator,
I was absolutely ignorant.
But I knew that I possessed no money,
no friends, no kind of property.
I was, besides, endued with a figure
hideously deformed and loathsome.
Hey, Eddie.
Hey, Wanda, Wanda, Wanda.
Was I then a monster?
A blot upon the Earth?
Hey, hey, hey. Monster? Monster?
Tell me the truth.
Is Wanda as fine as she sounds
or is she butt ugly like a dog?
He's fucking with you. We're old friends.
Yeah, but I ain't never
had nobody to ask before.
Monster, tell me the truth, Monster.
Is she pretty?
Huh?
- Pretty.
- Hey.
Hey, your friend has good taste, Eddie.
Yeah, but is she prettier
than that girl across the street?
How do you know there is a girl
crossing the street, Eddie?
'Cause I can hear her heels
clickety, click, click, click.
You know I'm prettier.
She's a nasty ass bitch.
Prettier.
- Prettier.
- Yeah.
I'm teaching him how to talk.
But he can't talk much. He's learning.
Really?
What's your name?
Monster.
Monster? Why are you hiding
in that hoodie?
He's shy. I've seen some
scary-looking creeps around here.
You can't look worse than that.
Come on.
Oh, yeah, he does.
He certainly does.
Honey...
Are you sick?
Is he contagious?
No, no, it ain't catching.
I've been hanging around him long enough.
Were you born that way?
Born?
Yeah. You know, when you were a baby.
Baby.
You know, like,
goo-goo, mama, itty-bitty baby shit.
- Mom?
- Yeah.
Monster, do you know
where babies come from?
Does he know anything?
He does. He does.
Monster.
Have you seen this shit before?
That's fucking.
Well, that's how babies are made.
All my past life was now a blot,
a blind vacancy
in which I distinguished nothing.
From my earliest remembrance
I had been as I then was
in height and proportion.
I don't think he's ever been with a woman.
Okay, well, I ain't giving no mercy fuck.
I mean, he's sweet and all
but he's got some serious problems.
What did this mean?
Who was I? What was I?
You don't have that kind of money, Eddie.
Whence did I come?
What was my destination?
Monster, is that shit all over your body?
When did you last take a bath?
Wanda, Wanda, all you got to do is take him
to a room and scrub him down.
A room? You got money for that, too?
I'll tell you what. I've got $100.
And that includes room and everything.
Thank you.
All right.
- Don't forget. Yeah.
- Here you go.
Don't you worry about a thing, okay?
Wanda's going to walk you
through the ropes, up and down.
- It's all right. Monster.
- Come on.
Come on.
- Take him by the hand, into the water.
- There you go.
Take him to the water.
Whoa!
What color dress you got there, Monster?
Red.
Monster, have fun.
What's this?
- Pretty.
- Yeah, she is.
Ugly.
You are. Yeah.
What?
Fucking.
Oh, honey, I'll fuck you.
Oh, you want to fuck her?
Yes.
Well, she ain't here and I am.
Well, she ain't putting out and I am,
so what do you say?
Do you love her?
- Love?
- Yeah.
Like, do you think about her all the time?
You know, dream about her?
Dream.
Like, pictures in your head?
Like this. See?
Pictures in your head when you sleep.
Dream.
- Dream.
- Yeah.
Love.
Yeah.
You're so sweet, Monster.
Do you want me to Google her?
Is that her?
You know her?
Okay. No, no, no. Okay.
You are sweet and all,
but you really, really got to take a shower
before we can do anything, okay?
Come on.
My...
Eddie doesn't know, does he?
He can't see how bad it is.
Bad.
Sorry, honey...
But I can't.
I knew you were a bum,
but I thought you were a man.
You don't even look human.
Love.
I will personally cover the hotel room.
I'll refund the money, okay?
Love.
Get the fuck off me! Stay away from me!
Get... Stop. Stop!
Get the fuck off me! Get the fuck off me!
No!
No. No. No.
What's going on in there?
Lay it off!
Hey, Wanda, are you all right?
What's the problem?
Monster?
Monster!
Hey, yo!
Open up the damn door!
Open up the damn door!
Damn it!
Wanda?
What's happening, huh?
Wanda?
Monster, how come
you didn't open the door?
I hear you. I hear you.
Wanda?
Eddie. Eddie.
What did you do?
Move. Move.
Are you fucking nuts?
You weren't supposed to do that to her.
You weren't supposed to hurt her!
You weren't supposed to hurt her.
Mannish boy!
Are you a man or are you an animal?
You fucking animal!
Eddie.
Eddie. Love.
Eddie. Love.
Eddie!
Eddie!
Eddie!
Once I falsely hoped to meet with beings
who, pardoning my outward form,
would love me for the qualities in my heart.
I cannot believe
that I'm the same creature
whose thoughts were once
filled with beauty and love.
Starting route to 26800
Mulholland Highway.
Tum left onto West 7th Street.
Hey!
In 400 feet, turn left
onto South Broadway.
Keep right to merge onto CA 110 North.
Hey, you can't walk here. Stop.
- Stop. Stop right there.
- In 500 feet,
keep right to merge onto CA 110 North.
Stop. You can't walk here.
Stop right there.
Sir, stop! I said stop.
Stop.
What the fuck?
How the fuck? What the fuck?
Fuck you!
Fuck you, freak show! Fuck yourself!
Shoot! You don't even
have the balls to shoot me.
Shoot me!
The fallen angel becomes
a malignant devil.
Yet even that enemy of God and man had
friends and associates in his desolation.
Proceed to the route.
I am alone.
In 9.8 miles, keep right
to merge onto US 101 North
towards Ventura.
I will revenge my injuries.
If I cannot inspire love,
I will cause fear.
In 19.6 miles, take exit 32
onto Las Virgenes Road.
You have reached your destination.
I don't know what's wrong with that guy.
Sit on the bed.
Now here comes Dr. Feelgood.
I love you so much.
Oh, what's happened?
Don't hurt him.
No!
No! No!
- Let him go. Let him go.
- Mine!
Why?
You said you did not know me.
I ugly.
Stop!
- No.
- Stop. Leave her.
No.
It's okay.
It's okay, Adam.
I'm sorry.
- Adam?
- Yes.
Your name is Adam.
See? That's how we made you.
- And we'll make you again.
- No.
Oh, no, yes.
Yes.
And this time you'll be beautiful.
Beautiful.
Oh.
You make me
ugly.
Why?
I don't know. It was a mistake.
The cells didn't replicate correctly,
and God only knows
what turned you into such a vicious beast.
Victor.
He is not me.
Not me.
He is...
Other.
- He is exactly like you.
- No.
I am
I.
Yes.
And you will be you again.
My boy, I understand your unhappiness.
I understand your pain.
And I can make it go away.
You will close your eyes
and you will sleep.
And when you wake up,
you'll be just fine.
He is dead?
He's nothing but clay.
But we can all breathe life into him.
You see, that is the secret
that God is so jealous of.
The formula for life.
And I, me, Dr. Frankenstein,
discovered it,
and I will do it again.
No!
I am!
I am.
I am.
I am. I am.
I am.
You.
You made me.
You
hate me.
No.
I'm alone.
I'm
alone.
I'll decapitate him
and then incinerate his head.
- Get off.
- No.
- Move.
- I can't.
Don't be ridiculous.
No. Oh.
Oh, my God. Oh, no.
I shall collect my funeral pile and consume
to ashes this miserable frame.
That its remains may afford no light
to any curious and unhallowed wretch
who would create such another
as I have been.
She is dead, who called me into being.
When I shall be no more,
the very remembrance of us both
will speedily vanish.
I will no longer see the sun nor stars,
or feel the winds play upon my cheeks.
I shall ascend
my funeral pile triumphantly
and exalt in the agony
of the torturing flames.
The light of that conflagration
will fade away.
My ashes will be swept into the sea
by the winds.
My spirit will sleep in peace.
Or if it thinks,
it will not surely think thus.
Farewell.
I am Adam!
