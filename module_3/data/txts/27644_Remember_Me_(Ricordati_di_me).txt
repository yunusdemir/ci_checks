Tom Parfitt was the only
person in the room
when a woman fell out of the window.
Tom had a wife?
~ Dorothea.
~ Well, what happened to her?
She died a long time ago.
He hasn't changed a bit, you know.
Who hasn't?
♪ Where were you going?
to Scarborough Fair
Look for him in Scarborough.
He's got hundreds of songs
about Scarborough.
I told her,
don't go looking for that old man.
And, you,
don't let her out of your sight.
Do you believe in ghosts?
Oh, my God!
~ Hannah, get off!
~ Come on, Sean, hurry up!
~ Hannah, get off me! ~ Sean, just get
in the car. ~ No!
Sean, I've not got time for this!
Sean!
Sean!
I don't want to go home!
I'm scared!
There's always water.
Water that shouldn't be there.
Alison had water on her lungs.
Shirley's flat, flooded out.
So how do you account for the
pathologist
reporting nothing unusual, then?
The Asian woman Shirley thought
she saw in the window.
Last I heard, she imagined it.
I don't think so.
First off,
he tells everyone he's 80-odd,
but there's three birthday cards
that says he's a liar.
He's 110-years-old.
There's loads of old photos
and stuff from India in his house.
Now, English families
during the Raj,
they all employed a local woman to
look after their children.
Then sailing back
here from India,
when they docked,
the nannies were all laid off.
Left in London, to wait for another
job to take them home.
Now, look, there she is...
Look. It's the same woman. Yeah?
It's his ayah.
His nanny,
from when he was a kid in India.
That's 1914?
She's long dead now, obviously.
Yeah well, we're police officers,
aren't we, Rob, so...
What do we think?
Well, we think,
that if that was taken in 1914,
there's no way that this child can
be Tom Parfitt.
But the birthday cards...
Well, we think it's a mistake, don't
we? Eh?
Or a joke.
Or first thing Monday morning,
why don't we call Buckingham Palace
and ask the bloody Queen?! Eh?
Rob. Listen.
Why don't you go
and do a bit of fishing.
Paint the house.
Come back
when you're feeling better, son.
Like you did before.
Dad? Dad, God, what is it?
What's happened? Is something wrong?
I just wanted to hear your voice.
It's the middle of the bloody night.
He's teething.
I've only just got him down.
Sorry, love. I didn't think.
Sorry.
I'll call you later.
~ 'Hello?' ~ I told you he'd be here.
I thought I'd come looking for him.
I thought I could do it on my own,
Rob.
~ Come home now, love. ~ 'We can't.'
'We're in trouble.'
'Remember me to a
bonny lass...'
'Hannah?'
'... to Scarborough Fair. Parsley,
sage...'
'Hannah?'
'Remember me to a bonny lass...'
'Remember me.'
♪ Where were you going?
♪ To Scarborough Fair
♪ Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
♪ Remember me to a bonny lass
there. ♪
~ Hannah, are you there? Hannah?
~ Sean?
What's happening?
Things I don't understand.
Sean! Sean!
~ Rob, I don't know what to do.
~ Find somewhere safe. Safe and warm.
A cafe on the seafront. I'll find
you.
I know how hard
this must be to hear.
I should have listened to her.
There were bottles of pills, yes.
Bottles of drink, so... yes, it
looks like an overdose,
but there's no way to be certain of
anything, at this stage,
except that it wasn't your fault.
Shirley didn't want me
to go looking for Tom.
No, she didn't.
I didn't want to.
Not really.
Even this morning when I set off,
I didn't really know why.
~ Hannah... ~ And I have these awful
dreams. There's a lake.
And sometimes Tom's there and...
.. and I'm drowning.
Say you're right.
Say there is a ghost.
You've done exactly what she wanted.
She's got Tom. We can go home.
End of.
End of nothing!
She killed Alison.
She killed Shirley. Who's next?
Do you know, I called you because I
thought you'd understand.
Hannah, there will be a rational
explanation.
Well, explain that.
Isha was Tom's ayah, his nanny...
.. when his family lived in India.
A long time ago.
Before the war. Before both wars.
Tom's a lot older than he looks.
He's A lot older than is even
possible.
We need to stop her, Rob.
Or I'll spend the rest of my life
looking over my shoulder.
Hello?
Where is that?
Can you text me a postcode? Thanks.
Someone's called in
a sighting of Tom Parfitt.
What now?
Now we go and find him.
~ Can I go play? ~ As long as you keep
in sight.
Tom!
Tom!
Tom, are you in there?
Oh, my God.
Don't worry. I'll find him.
Oh, my God.
Tom! Tom!
Tom! Tom, come back. He's breathing.
Oh, Tom, can you hear me?
It's Hannah!
It's Hannah, do you remember me?
He's soaked.
I just wanted to be free
but she'll not let me go.
Not ever. Come here.
I couldn't take anything with me
from the house, I realise that.
That's why my suitcase was empty.
Cos that's how she travels,
in things from the house.
The patient in the next bed wasn't
too pleased with you.
I were doing him a favour!
Bloody horrible thing,
that yellow cardigan.
I planned it all so careful,
in the beginning.
I thought it'll be all right
if I can make it look like it's
not my choice to leave home.
I didn't mean social worker to take
the blame, and I'm sorry.
Always been together,
me and her.
Always.
I cried that much
at the thought of losing her,
my parents had to bring her
back on the boat with us from India.
"I'll always look after you,"
she said to me.
Always.
Think of that.
Think of what that really means.
Please, Tom.
I need to know if she'll
hurt my brother.
She'd never hurt a child.
~ No, no, no, not in here!
~ Why not?
There might be evidence in here.
You might mess it up.
Mess it up yourself, big feet.
Hey, you can't be a policeman
unless you've got big feet.
If my dad was a policeman,
I'd keep it quiet.
What did he do, your dad?
Argued with me mum, mostly.
Have you got kids?
~ Yeah. I did have. Yeah.
~ Are they dead?
No, they're in Australia.
Cool! I'm going to go
play on the swings again.
Tom...
Tell me how it ends.
I don't know what you're on about.
The song on your piano,
sung by a Mr Hutton from Goathland.
My wife's grandfather.
After all the impossible tasks,
does it have a happy ending.
It's not a love song!
It's just a stupid old story.
When I hear it in my dreams,
it never gets to the end.
There's something really strange.
There's something about that song,
some old story from his wife's
family.
His wife who fell down the stairs?
His wife who's dead,
yeah, like Alison and Shirley.
His wife who was a Hutton,
from Goathland,
like the singer of the song.
Rob, if anything happens to him.
I'm so far out of my comfort
zone, I'm going to meet myself
coming back.
Do you know, it's fine. Forget it.
I'll go to Scarborough, I'll
pick up my mum's car and I'll go
~ to Goathland on my own. ~ You're going
nowhere on your own.
~ I'll cope fine, it's what I do.
~ Not now I'm here.
Hey. You all right?
Kicked seven bells out of you,
didn't she?
Didn't like you leaving home,
was that it?
What you brought me here for?
Family history.
Then you're wasting your time.
Them Hutton's are all long dead.
And if they're not, well,
they never approved of me.
It's up there.
Good evening. I'm
Detective Constable Rob Fairholme.
And this is Hannah.
Sage is for strength.
Rosemary, for faithfulness.
And thyme is for courage.
What about parsley?
Parsley? Good for the digestion.
Not very romantic, is it?
But I imagine that
was my grandfather for you.
Mr Richard Hutton.
Tell me, Detective Constable,
how exactly is this a police matter?
I'm told there's a family
story about the version
of Scarborough Fair your grandfather
used to sing.
I'm aware that's not a straight
answer to your question.
But to sew a shirt without
needlework,
it's an impossible task.
The tasks are just a list,
you take your pick.
It was the ending that mattered,
according to my sister.
That ending had the power to lay
a ghost to rest.
Dorothea loved all those old
stories.
I am so sorry...
The last time anyone
knocked on my door
asking about Scarborough Fair, was
60 years ago.
I couldn't help him.
And I can't help you either.
Miss Hutton, did you ever
hear your grandfather sing?
No, no. He died before I was born.
~ Dorothea? ~ My sister is dead.
Nothing will bring her back.
If there was an ending,
it died with her.
Who's there?
You...
Murderer...
~ All right. All right, Miss Hutton.
~ He took my sister.
~ He killed my Dorothea.
~ No! No, he didn't kill her.
He took her into mortal danger
and he let it happen.
It was his fault.
You think he doesn't know that?
Why did you come here?
Because people have died,
and I want it to stop.
People you love?
No.
Not yet.
Not yet!
It's all right,
we're all going home.
All the way to
Goathland in my Morris Minor,
like it were the other
end of the world.
I had so many tunes, so many verses,
but Richard Hutton's version
were different,
because he only sang three verses.
I were that mad in those
days, I thought, what's he hiding?
Has he got a last verse,
and he's not letting on?
So, I banged on the door.
And she opened it.
Dorothea?
I came looking for one thing,
and found another.
What really happened to her, Tom?
All those years, stuck in the house.
Stuck in the shadows.
I thought she'd understand...
.. but Isha wasn't ready to let me
go.
Tom. What happened at the lake?
~ What lake?
~ She dreams about a lake.
Isha's there, and you and me.
There was never a lake.
Only the sea.
Right. No arguments.
Get him to bed,
then you put yourself to bed.
Get some sleep
and leave the worrying to me.
I don't need a new dad, Rob.
OK.
Not as much as he does, anyway.
Who's there?
Hello?
Oh, my God, you two.
You frightened the life out of me.
We do live here.
It's five in the bloody morning.
Where have you been?
The seaside.
Keep him safe.
I've got to go back out.
~ Back out? I've been worried sick.
~ Oh, please.
We could to go the pub.
Or to a nightclub!
Now then!
Pull a couple of mucky women!
You and I have got
nothing in common!
Both of us on our own.
Neither of us getting any younger.
80 odd!
Nobody gets a birthday card
from the Queen for being 80 odd.
Oh, yeah, I've got some questions.
~ You're always so hard on me.
~ I was only seven.
Right? And my dad had to get me a
nanny
and she came in every day for what
must have been three years, right?
~ Cos I was how old? ~ Nine.
When you opened the door,
smiling all over your face,
like that made it all right.
The important thing is I came back.
That nanny, she cried...
She cried when she left me.
You didn't, you just disappeared,
but she did.
She held me so tight and I can't even
remember her name.
I never stopped loving you.
The one thing your dad
and I ever agreed about.
We loved our baby girl.
I used to sit at the top
of the stairs night after night
and think how can I make them
be nice to each other?
It didn't mean anything,
the fighting...
How can I can think up the right
things to say?
It's just how it was,
how love was, for me and your dad.
Like there was some magic spell
that could make it all better.
But the night he died...
Don't do this.
I thought, do you know what?
I can't be bothered.
If they want to kill each other,
then that's fine by me.
I went to bed.
And I heard my dad slam the door...
.. and I heard his car...
.. and I knew then, that he
was driving too fast...
It wasn't your fault.
I don't mind the boyfriends, Mum.
I just wish they made you happy.
What about you, my beautiful baby?
When's your life going to start?
I'm too busy looking
after my brother.
It were me birthday again.
And postman knocked on the door with
a card from the Queen, again...
.. and I thought...
I thought there's got to be
a way out of this.
110 years.
It's long enough.
You're not under arrest,
you're free to go at any time.
Let's start at the beginning.
They had a slogan.
Remember Scarborough!
After the bombardment.
December 1914.
The German bombardment that
killed my parents.
It were headline news, even
in London.
Their names in the paper and mine.
Poor little orphan boy.
Isha were in London by then,
waiting for passage home to India.
She bribed her way on to a cargo
ship, called The Gem.
Struck a mine three and a half miles
south east by east of Scarborough.
Christmas Day, 1914.
Ten crew lost...
.. and one passenger...
.. whose name were never listed.
~ Was it you put that back together?
~ Was it you tore it in half?
Or was it Dorothea?
When I first met Dorothea,
she was 18-years-old.
It were love at first sight.
I never told her my real age
to start with.
I didn't want to put her off.
But when I did, I told her
everything, everything,
I loved her that much.
She wanted to help?
She said, "Let's
sing my grandfathers ending.
"See if it can really lay a ghost."
We'd no idea if it would work,
but she was made up with it.
No sooner home than she's skipping
up the stairs and starting to sing.
And I have a bad feeling,
and I'm pleading with her, "Please
don't, don't sing."
"Don't sing to the end."
Then Isha was there...
.. at the top of the stairs.
And Dorothea fell.
I saw my lovely girl fall.
Why did she do that, Tom?
Isha.
Isha pushed her. Oh, God.
Interview terminated at 6.24am.
Your boss'll have a laugh
when he listens to those tapes.
I can put those tapes in a cupboard
where they'll stay for seven years.
After which time,
they'll go in the bin.
We're going to sort this one
out by ourselves.
Just me and you.
Why don't you take her home, Tom?
Take Isha home and keep her happy.
Just the two of you, safe and sound,
nobody else involved,
just like it always used to be.
Just Tom and Isha
and leave those children out of it.
It's too late for that,
I can't stop her now.
Christ!
Nancy?
Oh, Nancy.
Come on, let me dry your eyes.
You live your life,
and then it's gone.
Nowt to be done about it, love.
And after...
Who will remember me?
I will.
You'll have better
uses for your time.
Nancy, do you remember when we were
here before,
on that day when it all went wrong,
when Tom came?
You recognised him.
You knew him.
I thought he looked like me
grandma's neighbour.
But then I thought, no,
they'll all be dead by now.
Do you remember the day Tom
brought his new wife home?
They drove up. In a taxi! Imagine.
And he threw open the door and
he carried her over the threshold.
Oh, it were romantic.
And she started singing.
♪ Remember me to a bonny lass
there... ♪
She didn't get to the end, did she?
"Come on, Tom," she goes,
join in with me.
She wanted him to sing with her?
"Sing the ending," she says, "Come
on."
He says, "I don't want to.
I don't want to no more."
And she carried on singing,
just for a bit, until...
Until what, Nancy?
Until he pushed her down the stairs
to shut her up.
And then he sees me looking.
"Don't you ever tell," says he.
Can you hear them?
The children, playing on the lake?
She's gone to work
and she seems to have lost my car.
~ Is your son with you?
~ Still in bed, the lazy little tyke.
Hey!
~ Sean! ~ What do you think you're
doing? ~ Open the door.
~ What is going on? ~ Open the door!
Oh, my God!
~ Rob? ~ Have you got Sean with you?
~ He's at home with me mum.
~ Where are you? Are you at work?
Hannah? Are you still there, love?
~ Hannah? Answer me!
~ It's been here all along. The lake.
It's the millpond.
Just stay put. I'll find you.
Where are you going?
You killed your wife.
I loved her. I loved them both.
You had the ending, you could have
sung it but you chose Isha.
She came back from the dead for me.
How could I send her back there?
Sean?
Oh, my God.
~ Hannah, wait. ~ No, there's no time
for waiting, no time for thinking,
~ there's just doing it.
~ You can't fight her.
Then you'll have to come with me.
Tom, please!
Can we sing it from here?
Are we close enough?
It looks that way.
