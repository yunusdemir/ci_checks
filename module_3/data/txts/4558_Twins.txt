<i> I don't know.</i>
     <i> Maybe we were doomed</i>
      <i> from the beginning.</i>
   <i> I mean, it's not like Dad</i>
       <i> was Mr. Sunshine.</i>
       <i> Sometimes I think</i>
       <i> all our problems</i>
    <i> came directly from him.</i>
         <i> But a lot of</i>
   <i> the good stuff did, too.</i>
         <i> Remember what</i>
     <i> he always called us?</i>
     <i> The Gruesome Twosome.</i>
 <i> He told us to stick together,</i>
        <i> no matter what.</i>
<i> God...</i>
         <i> what the hell</i>
        <i> happened to us?</i>
         <i> ¶ Oh, Denis,</i>

- - Hello?
<i> Hi, is this Maggie Dean?</i>
              Yes.
         <i> This is L.A.</i>
    <i> Presbyterian Hospital.</i>
        You know, I'm on
    the National Do Not Call
           Registry.
          How did you
        get this number?
 <i> Uh, I'm calling to inform you</i>
    <i> that your brother Milo</i>
  <i> was admitted this afternoon</i>
  <i> after an attempted suicide.</i>
          <i> He's okay.</i>
           <i> Ms. Dean?</i>
              Yes.
       -<i> He's okay. </i>
       - Good, thank you.
It's a good thing
he was blasting his music.
A neighbor complained
and got the building manager.
                Mm.
 Here's his note.
See ya later."
Jesus.
<i> When was the last time</i>
      <i> you saw each other?</i>
<i> About 10 years.</i>
                Hey, Milo.
                  Hey.
You changed your hair.
                 Oh, yeah.
                 It's--
It's been light
           for a while, I guess.
                 <i> Look at you.</i>
 Yeah, look at me.
 Another tragic
 gay cliché.
          I don't know
          if you still like
          apple fritters.
          Probably not
          as good as Jensen's.
I'm not really hungry.
            I'll just
            leave them here.
            How many days
            did they say you
            have to be in here?
A day or two.
           <i> Do you have anyone--</i>
              do you live alone?
Yeah, I live alone.
           Well, I'm around
           the next couple days,
           if you need anything.
Maggie, this was just
some stupid thing I did.
I was drunk and feeling
melodramatic, so...
<i> you didn't</i>
<i> have to come here.</i>
  You should go.
<i> Hey.</i>
  They told me
  you were down here.
I get discharged today.
They just called me a cab.
I thought you were going home.
    Why, because
    you told me to?
<i> No, because</i>
<i> I asked you to.</i>
So, what, are you
king of the hospital now?
Have you read
        "Marley and Me"?
       Yeah, sad.
                Why is it sad?
  You don't
  know what happens?
                No, that's why
                I'm reading it.
      Oh, sorry.
           - What?
           - Nothing.
   - What, does
     the dog die at the end?
   - No, I didn't say that.
The fucking dog
dies at the end.
              I didn't-- I'm not
              saying anything.
  Look how much
  I had left.
I'm sorry I ruined it.
            Maggie,
            I know the dog dies.
            <i> Everyone knows</i>
            <i> the dog dies.</i>
            It's the book
            where the dog dies.
       Asshole.
<i> I see you're getting</i>
<i> your sense of humor back.</i>
         Yeah, they can't
         take that away from me.
I was thinking, um...
 maybe you'd wanna
 come stay with me?
                 What, back
                 to New York?
     <i> Yeah.</i>
          I mean just
          for a little bit,
          until you feel better.
          I have a guest room
          and you can meet Lance
          finally.
Nyack's really beautiful
this time of year.
      So the crack team of
      hospital crisis counselors
      got to you too, huh?
This was my decision.
             Yeah, whatever.
             They guilted you
             into this.
You're right.
It's probably a bad idea.
 Hey, Maggie.
<i> I have an aquarium</i>
full of very beloved,
fat goldfish.
        You can get new goldfish
        in New York.
                 Welcome home.
Hey, here he is.
        - Lance.
        - Yeah, sure am.
    - How are ya?
    - Great to meet you.
     Oh, shit. Sorry, man.
It's okay.
Don't worry about it.
They're healing over,
so it's fine.
         I'm so psyched
      to finally meet you,
           you know?
Yeah, you, too.
        Mysterious Milo
      in the flesh, right?
Well, actually,
I'm clothed now,
so you'll have
to get to know me
a little bit better
before you see me
in the flesh.
Cool, cool.
           Well, hey,
     if you need anything,
      I'm around, so don't
      hesitate to holler.
           I'm just--
    I'm doing a few chores.
I will, I will, thank you.
Thanks for having me.
            Okay,
            take it easy, amigo.
   Y-you, too, amigo.
Jesus, Maggie.
     So, Milo, you hear about
     your wild and crazy sister?
                Are you--
                he doesn't know?
      Your wild and crazy sister
      has been taking, um...
     - Mm.
     - Give me a drumroll.
- Come on, drumroll.
-        Come on, louder.
           Scuba diving lessons.
       - Yeah.
       - Doesn't that
         sound like fun?
     Yeah, if you like
     scuba diving, yeah.
            I do.
             She's preparing
             for our tropical
             Hawaiian honeymoon.
                  It's gonna
                  be badass.
       Honeymoon?
              Better two years
              late than never.
              It was her idea.
              It was your idea.
   - Better late than never.
   - Yeah.
           <i> She's always</i>
           <i> getting crazy ideas.</i>
           Last month,
           it was salsa dancing.
            Have you ever heard
            of salsa dancing?
            It's kind of like
            a Spanish-flavored
            dancing?
 Yeah, yeah,
 the-- the-- yeah.
  - So now it's scuba diving.
  - Yeah.
        - You ever been?
        - Uh, no, no.
     - Dude, you'd love it.
      It's awesome.
     - Right.
         <i> Me and my buddy Craig,</i>
         <i> a couple years ago,</i>
         <i> we went to Costa Rica.</i>
         This was before Maggie
         was on the scene--
         PM, pre-Maggie--
          and the first time
          we go out on a dive,
    we saw an effing sea turtle,
    which is very rare.
 - Incredibly rare.
 - I think it's pretty normal--
  right? Seeing sea turtles?
<i> What? </i>
     - When you're diving,
      seeing sea turtles?
- I think that's very--
- No, I think you're thinking of
 just, like, regular turtles
          that you'd see
          in a pond or a stream.
       I'm talking about
       a sea turtle in the wild.
      <i> We were swimming so close</i>
      <i> to it that you could</i>
      <i> practically touch it.</i>
      Mm-hmm.
                Is it okay
                if I tell him?
                Can I?
 - Nothing really to tell yet.
 - You ready for some big news?
               We're trying
               to get pregnant.
       - Really?
       - We are trying
        to get pregnant.
 - Yep.
 - And I say "we are," because
  it's not sexist that way.
      - Right? That's what
       you told me.
      - Yeah.
  I thought you never
  wanted to have kids.
Well, I may have said that
in high school or something,
but obviously people
change their minds on that.
No, I-- that's great.
  I love kids.
Except the fat ones.
Fuck those
little turds, right?
   He's kidding.
   He's being a smartass.
    - Don't mind him.
    - I'm messing with you.
 I was like, "Whoa, what's
 this guy got against fat kids?"
   - No, he's--
   - I mean, I was a fat kid.
      -<i> Oh, you were? </i>
      - I was built like
       a damn tank, yeah.
  - She's seen the pictures.
  - It's pretty cute, though.
            I look like a--
            just a little pillow
            with legs.
    - A little marshmallow.
    - Yeah.
Hey, here's to you guys.
                       Thanks.
May your kids
be happy and fat.
              Cool, man, thanks.
             I mean, it hasn't
             happened yet,
            but we're definitely
            giving it a go.
Well, keep trying, guys.
I can't wait to be
the creepy gay uncle.
        - You're hired.
        - Okay.
- You got the job.
             - Hey.
             - Hey.
         - Settling in?
         - Yeah.
    No, yeah, it's like
    a Martha Stewart wonderland.
       So, you met Lance.
              Yeah, I met Lance.
Isn't he the best?
       Yeah, he's like
       a big Labrador retriever.
Yeah, I guess.
He's just the nicest guy
on the planet.
I really lucked out.
             Yeah, you're really
             going for it.
What does that mean?
           You're going for it--
           just, like, the job,
           the house,
              the furniture...
              the Lance.
I guess I grew up.
     - So, what about you?
     -<i> What about me?</i>
Well, last I heard,
you moved to LA
to be an actor?
That was, like,
10 years ago?
   - Yeah, did you not hear?
    I won an Oscar.
   - Oh, very funny.
       Yeah, I played a retarded
       Ukrainian immigrant
      who inspires a bunch
      of school kids in Brooklyn
            by playing chess.
- Seriously.
- Seriously, acting's kinda hard
  when you don't have an agent.
                    So...
Well, what are you
doing for money?
Let me guess,
male prostitute joke
coming--
         What do you
         want me to say, Maggie?
        I wait tables
        at a shitty tourist
        restaurant in Hollywood.
   It's fucking boring, the end.
   What do you want to know?
           <i> You know, I'm tired.</i>
           <i> I'm gonna go to bed.</i>
All right,
good night.
       Shit.
The key to buddy breathing
        is not to panic.
        Don't freak out
         or you'll die.
Don't yank the regulator
away from your partner.
 Don't bogart
 the thing either.
All right, so,
everybody partner up.
   Let's go,
   let's do it.
 Looking for a date?
          - Huh?
          - A partner.
   Oh.
   Oh, yeah, sure.
      Okay.
<i> This is a book that we're</i>
    <i> selling a lot more of.</i>
   Uh, it's just
   much more practical.
     It's much more
     hands-on.
      - Does that sound--
      - It sounds perfect.
    Okay, good.
    Yeah, good luck.
 Thank you.
              Surprise.
          Milo.
          Back from the dead.
                  What are you
                  doing here?
I just rolled into town.
I wanted to say--
          No, what are you doing
          here at the store?
I am looking for the new
Danielle Steel novel.
                 You should go.
 No-- hey, no, I--
 let's go hiking.
Let's go to
Kate's Lazy Meadow
and, you know,
go to the
Harvest Festival and--
             Milo, you're out
             of your mind.
   No, Rich,
   I just think--
          Don't come here again.
              When do the boys
              show up?
    It's Dyke Night,
    sweetie.
         - It's what?
         - Dyke Night.
                    Dyke Night?
                  I showed up
                  on Dyke Night?
         Yeah.
                        Shit.
- - Jesus.
    Hey, Cal's Corner,
    fucking Dyke Night.
           - What?
           - Oh, boy.
       Dyke Night.
             Milo, can we
             talk about this
             in the morning?
Sandra and Melissa
were very nice.
They were
two lesbian ladies
who taught me
how to play darts.
<i> But they were not</i>
<i> what I was looking for.</i>
What I was looking for,
and you should know this
since we're
now related, Lance,
  I was looking
  for some cock.
            Okay, Milo, enough.
You're fine 'cause
you're married to my sister.
      - You're off-limits.
      - "Off-limits."
Just letting you know,
if any of your little
buddies around--
     - I will be on them
      like steak on rice.
     -<i> Milo! Go to bed.</i>
         Okay, Milo, good night.
I'm just letting you know.
I'm a little tipsy.
        - I'm sorry.
        - That's okay.
           - No shit.
           - Phew.
      - Milo, good night.
      - Good night.
- Yeah, about last night.
- You can't do stuff like that.
Sorry, I was just trying
to blow off some steam,
that's all.
   I just--
             So, um, Lance
             and I were talking,
                  and he might
                  need some help
           on this trail project
           at the dam.
            Just clearing brush
            and stuff.
 A trail project
 at the dam?
              Yeah.
              It's what he does.
 What do you mean,
 clearing brush?
  - Like picking up sticks?
  - Brush-- sticks and leaves
            and pieces of bushes
            and stuff.
  -<i> It might be good for you. </i>
  - So, it's like a job?
           It might be nice
           for you to spend time
           with him and stuff.
               Be out in nature
               with the brush.
Do I get a sexy outfit?
           I'll make sure of it.
        Here.
        - Ahem.
        - I should've worn
          longer sleeves.
            Yeah, no, I mean,
            next time, you know?
            'Cause then if you
            have long sleeves,
           you can make more
           of a scooping motion.
       You might be able to get
       more with each grab,
       you know?
   Yeah, no, I get it.
 I'm not really
 an outdoorsy kinda guy.
              Right.
              Well, no worries,
              my man.
              You know, I got
              an extra fleece
              in the truck.
     - You want me to go--
     - No, no, I'm good.
         - Thank you.
         - You got it?
   Oh, you gotta be
   fucking kidding me.
You okay? You all right?
  Take a breath.
  Take a breath.
What happened down there?
              Nothing, I'm fine.
          - Yeah?
          - I'm fine.
    All right.
- - Hello?
    - Hi.
    - What the hell's that?
        Happy first day of work.
You didn't
have to do that.
               What, you
               don't like it?
 No, I love it.
 It's great.
 So, I told somebody
 that I was in town,
and I didn't think
she would come,
 so don't freak out.
         Hi, angel.
                  Mother.
Oh, dear.
     - Whoa.
     - Okay, broken glass.
       Everybody freeze.
              I'm gonna go
              get a dustpan.
              You okay?
        - Yeah.
        -<i> I'm gonna go</i>
        <i> </i> get a dustpan.
                 Okay.
      - So, that's Tanner?
      - No, that's Tad.
     - Oh.
     - Tanner's the oldest.
They look a lot
like their father.
- Mm-hmm.
- See?
<i> I love Arches.</i>
<i> The Grand Canyon's</i>
<i> gotten so commercial.</i>
<i> Arches has retained</i>
<i> its essence, you know?</i>
It's just such
a very, very spiritual place.
           Arches is rad.
          <i> I actually</i>
        <i> road-tripped it</i>
          <i> down there</i>
         <i> spring break</i>
        <i> sophomore year.</i>
      - It's insane.
       Unbelievable.
      - A toast? A toast?
I want to make a toast.
To my beautiful,
beautiful children,
       - and to my lovely
         son-in-law.
       - Oh.
May the light embrace you
with its energy infinite.
May you dwell in a place
of peace and tolerance.
May you live in warmth
and understanding
for your days eternal.
            - Amen.
            - Yeah.
         - Cheers.
         - Now, mm-hmm.
Darling, thank you.
So, when are you gonna
come down and visit us
in Sedona?
  Uh, I guess whenever
  we're invited.
Oh, my God.
You just have to show up.
   Just drop in.
   We don't like
   to be scheduled.
  - Perfect.
  - Great, so how's next week?
Next-- that's not gonna
actually be the best week.
        Okay, great.
        The week after that.
        We can go then.
     Oh, um...
    Okay, well...
          Hey, Mom,
          how are the alpacas?
We had to get rid of them.
Too much poop.
  You know what they say,
  everybody poops, right?
         When I was a kid,
         I didn't think that
         girls pooped.
       - Seriously.
       - I've never taken
        a shit before.
Milo.
     So what about
     your insight retreats, Mom?
   What about them?
             Do you have one
             coming up?
     Why do you ask?
Oh, I just want to make sure
I don't schedule
the most important event
of my life on the same day.
          Okay, just--
You know it broke my heart
to miss the wedding.
       Actually, you know,
       I don't know that it did.
   - You're here now, right?
   - Yes, yes. Thank you.
            Did everybody hear
            how I've never taken
            a shit before?
Why are we talking about
such unpleasant things?
   Milo, what's new
   with you, darling?
           I'm gonna go grab
           the Tabasco.
         Anybody like anything?
      Everything's great.
           It's good.
  That's terrific.
    Everything
    is terrific.
               Now, breathe out.
- -<i> Yes.</i>
                You're cleansed.
                Open your eyes.
                Oh, my God.
                How do you feel?
        Good, yeah.
        I might be a
        little drunk.
  You look
  completely different.
     Oh, my God,
     there's just--
     there's a--
 a purity and a kind of
 a glow coming off you.
 It's emanating
 from your crown chakra.
 Lance, would you like
 to be cleansed?
I'm okay, thank you.
I took a sauna this morning.
       - But I feel good.
       - Sweetheart?
           Oh, I don't usually
           drink and cleanse.
             Just, like,
             personal policy.
             <i> But thank you.</i>
          Okay, I guess I should
          be heading back.
What, like,
back to Arizona?
         Well, it's a terrific
         coincidence.
           You know, Maggie,
           you asked me about
           the insight retreat.
   Guess where
   it is this year?
   Woodstock.
   Around the corner.
     Oh, you've
     gotta be kidding.
I mean, it's such a--
this just worked out perfectly.
So that's why you came here?
            No, no.
          I came here
        to see you two.
           Oh, just shut up,
           Mother.
       - Hey, Maggie.
       - This is classic.
      - Classic bullshit.
      - Okay, Maggie.
I have to compliment
you, though. I really do.
But I have to tell you
you're really not that
good of an actress.
             Okay.
       Well, as pleasant
         as this is...
Stop trying, Judy.
  Stop trying.
There are worse things
than being a shitty mother.
             So...
     if you've finished...
vomiting all over me...
           I will just say
           thank you for dinner,
           and, Milo, thank you
           for the invitation.
      I'm sorry the night
    ended up being so toxic.
          I just want
       you both to know.
          Oh, my God.
I'm sending you the light.
  <i> Good night, Lance.</i>
              Good night, Judy.
              I'll walk you out.
         Well, at least
  she's sending us the light.
      - Are those shoes?
      - Uh, yeah, kinda.
       They're a hybrid.
              Hybrid of...
Of, uh, you know,
just shoes and a foot.
 The human foot.
           You know, some people
           use a knife and fork
           for those things.
Yeah? Well,
I'm not most people, babe,
and I think that's
why you love me.
'Cause I set myself
aside from the pack.
        - Yeah.
        -<i> I'll see you</i>
        <i> </i> tonight, okay?
    I gotta get going.
       - Oh, there he is.
       - Hey.
      - What's up, chief?
      - Mm-hmm.
                  No-- nothing.
<i> Okay, I'll check</i>
<i> you two dudes later.</i>
<i> Wallet, Lance.</i>
<i> Where is it, baby?</i>
<i> Where is it?</i>
<i> Whoo!</i>
             Is he ever
             not like that?
You know I'm happy
that you're here, right?
            Ugh, here it comes.
<i> And you can stay</i>
<i> as long as you need.</i>
      - But...
      -<i> What do you think?</i>
- I thought she'd be different.
- It doesn't matter.
 You had no right bringing
 her into this house
 without asking me.
             Yes, Warden.
  Did you really think
  she'd be different,
  that she actually
  gave a shit about us?
           - Maybe.
           - Please.
She's been done with us
ever since Dad--
I don't even blame him.
Imagine being married to her.
I'd probably jump off
a bridge, too.
                  Okay.
   I don't want this.
   Eat it.
              Okay.
      - So, how you feel?
      - I'm good.
            - Yeah?
            - Yeah.
        I'm a little embarrassed
        about the other day.
        I was on planet Jupiter
        or something.
Don't worry about it.
       - I'm a doof.
       - Nah, you're one
        of my favorites.
Someone told me
to read this once.
  Where to, boss?
       I need you to tell me
       why you're here.
I'm-- I just want
to make conversation.
I just want to see
how you're doing.
       - Really?
       - Yeah, nothing--
        nothing more.
I'm not gonna chop
your balls off just yet.
         Okay, 'cause I really
         wasn't expecting to see
         you anytime soon.
        - I'm sure.
        - This is weird.
I know.
I know it's weird.
    Um...
So, how are-- how--
what are you--
  how are you?
            I'm good.
            Yeah, I'm good.
            I have a girlfriend.
   Ah.
                 Um... Melinda.
           She's great.
           She's an optometrist.
  Oh, cool.
             Really good for me.
             She gets along with
             Eric really well.
           - Eric?
           - My son.
Right, your son.
          Are you
          living here now?
    No, no, I--
    temporarily.
   I'm just here--
   I live in LA.
       - LA, that's cool.
       - Yeah, yeah.
   - How's that?
   - Good, good.
    It's going really well.
I mean, the key is
just staying busy, you know?
I've just been acting
and auditioning
   and I just
   got this agent.
        - Really?
        - Yeah, I have
          an agent now.
         An agent.
         Wow, that's impressive.
   Yeah.
     What brings you to town
     other than scaring the shit
     out of me at a bookstore?
 Yeah, that was
 my sole purpose.
No, I-- I--
there's a writer's retreat.
You know, I'm writing
this one-man show.
       Well, it doesn't
       surprise me at all.
       - Oh.
       - You were always
        a great writer.
Oh, well, I had a--
I had a good teacher.
- <i> It's a little cove</i>
 <i> </i> off the Pawai Bay
      <i> on the Kona Coast,</i>
      <i> off the Big Island.</i>
My mate Mike
has been there since '05
taking small groups diving,
and I'm telling you--
        - Pretty?
        - It's stunning.
Sea turtles, manta rays,
blue sharks.
         That sounds incredible.
         Except for the sharks,
         I guess.
They're harmless.
  Besides...
you could handle
a little old shark.
            - Whoa.
            - Hmm.
      - You want another?
      - Yeah.
                    No. No.
              I think I've
              filled my quota.
                I should go.
I haven't finished
my drink yet.
           Here, I'll take that.
- - Okay, there we go.
                That was fun.
                We had drinks.
                That was nice.
Thank you.
              Uh, I will
              see you in class.
                  Shit.
<i> Sweetie?</i>
             Yeah?
        <i> Are we out of</i>
        <i> pizza pockets?</i>
          I think so.
    <i> Well, can you put them</i>
     <i> on the list, please?</i>
            <i> Honey?</i>
      So, you'll
      pick me up after work?
       Okay.
   - All right, well,
    have a good day at work.
   -<i> I will.</i>
     - Tell Lance I say hi.
     - I will.
   Okay.
   All right.
    - Bye, have a good day.
    - See ya, bye.
                    Bye.
        What's up?
          Do you think
     I should have a baby?
      I mean, do you think
     I would be a good mom?
                  Um...
                I don't--
                I don't know.
                I mean, I--
                I think you'd be
                very attentive.
        Okay.
                And maybe a bit
                overprotective.
                 Uptight.
Gee, thanks.
                No, I'm just
                being honest,
                I'm-- it's--
         it's a loaded question.
         I'm sorry.
 I think I'd be
 an excellent mom.
                      Okay.
How about something
that doesn't make me
feel like a piece of shit?
You know, you're so
goddamn selfish, Milo,
it's mind-blowing.
                   Maggie.
Oh, that's classic
Maggie, man. Classic.
          Yeah, she just
          jumped down my throat.
       - It was crazy.
       - Land mines, man.
It's like sometimes
she and I will be
strolling through the park
          laughing,
          getting along perfect,
            and then, kaboom,
            you know?
            A freakin' land mine
            blows my nuts off.
        Mm.
     And I'll think,
     "Oh, I coulda sworn my nuts
     were there a minute ago.
             I wonder
             where they went."
       - No nuts.
       - Oh, there--
         there they are.
          They got blown
          clear across the room.
      They're sliding
      down that wall over there.
                 My nuts.
And then, you know,
when I think about it,
it was probably my fault
in the first place,
<i> I probably said</i>
<i> something stupid</i>
<i> or insensitive,</i>
so I'll just tell her
that I was sorry,
and then it's fine.
                    Mm.
Land mines, dude.
- <i>-  There she is.</i>
            Your chariot awaits.
             All right, look,
             I'm sorry.
                I'm an idiot.
So what else is new?
        You'd make
        an amazing mother, okay?
I thought
I was too uptight?
        I just said that
        so I didn't have to talk
        about the real issue,
          which is
          your morbid obesity.
       I'm surprised you
       can even leave the house.
When was the last time
you had your teeth cleaned?
   - No. No, no, no, no, no.
   - Come on.
     - No.
     - Hey, I am a licensed
      dental hygienist.
 Don't you want
 to see me work?
                 No.
<i> There are so many planets,</i>
      <i> yet so little time.</i>
All right, okay,
I'm gonna take this.
     - Wait, what
       are you doing?
     - Milo, that's enough.
 - Wait, wait, wait.
  I'm not done yet.
 - Come on, seriously, let go.
           - Let go.
           - Ow.
        - I'm not done.
        - Stop.
- Okay, okay, you ready?
-     -<i>  Okay,</i>    <i> </i> uh-huh.
           'Cause this is
           serious stuff here.
- Mm-hmm.
<i> A few more seconds.</i>
Ah!
Give that to me!
Give that to me.
            - Spit.
            - Hmm?
        - Spit in there.
        - Mm.
- Sorry, I think
        this is broken.
   Oh, my--
   Milo, stop.
    - That thing-- you gotta
      have that thing fixed.
    - My God.
            You know what?
            You need to take
            the edge off.
Yeah, right. No.
           Everybody's doing it.
  - If you don't do it, no one
    will ever talk to you.
  - I'm not doing it.
      - Ross is doing it,
        Tina's doing it.
      - Mm-hmm.
              Emily's doing it,
              Casey's doing it,
 - Shannon is doing it.
 - Shannon cannot be doing it.
  - Eric T. and Eric S.
  - Eric T. and Eric S., too?
            Eric S. and Eric T.
            are both doing it.
I'm not doing it.
I have a very serious
       question for you.
<i> Mm-hmm?</i>
          Will you go
        to prom with me?
                     Ah!
               Uh-oh, I think
               you're gassy.
<i> Pfft.</i>
                    Pfft.
                 Pfft.
              It's okay,
              this won't hurt.
              Ready?
Ow.
     - That hurt?
     - Your elbow went
       into my arm muscle.
"Your elbow went into
         my arm muscle, mister."
"Your elbow went into
my arm muscle, mister.
Oh, my paper route's
gonna be screwed."
I'm getting out of here.
Pfft, pfft,
pfft, pfft, pfft.
    Pfft.
That was a good joke.
           Thanks.
      - I have to tell you
        something, Maggie.
      - What?
                   Last month
                   in LA, um...
         What? What?
                   I ate pussy.
          What?
       - What?
       - I know, I'm not
        proud of it.
       Why? How?
       Why? Who?
           I-- she looked like
           a young Debbie Harry.
       I was drunk and curious.
       I just couldn't resist.
     Oh, my gosh.
     Well, what--
     how-- verdict?
              Uh, I was a little
              out to sea.
             I'll tell you that.
              Out in a wet,
              stormy,
         - pungent sea.
         - Ew.
               All right,
               now your turn.
     My turn?
            I told you a secret.
            You have to tell me
            a secret.
   I don't have
   any secrets.
                     Maggie.
                   Maggie Dean.
I'm on birth control.
                   Really?
            - Yeah.
            - Oh.
I hide it in the basket
in the bathroom.
I figure Lance
won't be looking
for butterfly decorative
soaps anytime soon.
So...
  it's terrible.
          Wouldn't it be easier
          just to tell Lance
              you're not ready
              to have a kid?
     Yeah.
It would be
  a lot easier.
But there's a little more
to it than that.
                    What?
       - It's really bad.
       - What?
          I slept with
          my scuba instructor.
      Maggie.
             I know, it sounds
             like a porno.
    <i> Just once?</i>
         - With him?
         - "With<i> him"?</i>
         Yeah. I took
         a French cooking class
         like six months ago.
     <i> Maggie!</i>
       And a nature photography
       course-- I met this guy.
It's a fetish
is what it sounds like.
           If Lance finds out,
           it will destroy him
          and I will not be able
          to live with myself.
          Please say something.
I guess Lance just
doesn't do it for you.
But why?
He's so great.
He's so sweet
and cute and nice
and he would make
such a great dad,
and he is the polar opposite
of all the assholes
that I'm used to dating.
He doesn't deserve
a fucking whore as a wife.
  - You're not a whore,
   so don't say that, please.
  - Oh, really?
What would
you call it, then?
You're a restless housewife
with whore-like tendencies.
                 Shut up.
              It doesn't help.
Do you love him?
               Yeah, I do.
             He's-- he's good.
  Maybe good
  isn't your thing.
                   Maybe.
             What am I gonna do?
You're gonna do
a bunch of nitrous
with your gay brother?
You wanna talk about
this more downstairs?
      Sure.
   - Oh, this hurts my back.
   - Me, too, my spine.
        Why did I say,
        "Let's talk downstairs"?
I don't know.
          Wait, what time is it?
    I don't know.
                     Shit.
      What?
           Come on, we gotta go.
      - Why?
      - I have a meeting.
You have a meeting?
With who?
          With, um, Kevin Clancy
          from high school.
           - Really?
           - Yeah.
  Cool.
  Can I come?
                   Uh, no.
    I think he wanted to make it
    kind of like a one-on-one
    kind of meeting.
        - Oh.
        - Is that weird?
          I'm sorry.
      - No, no, it's fine.
      - Is that cool?
   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
   - All right, we gotta go,
    though.
              We gotta go.
  <i> ¶ Oh, Denis, do be do... ¶</i>
<i> Oh, my God,</i>
      <i> you're killing me.</i>
          No, listen, it's like,
          "Melvin, dude, please,
           just write me a story
           about a whale,
      a guy who catches a whale.
            Why does it have
            to be 800 pages
            of the history
            of whaling
        and all this existential
        crisis bullshit?"
Like, who gives a shit
when the writing is that weird
and funny and rich
and alive
and did I mention
weird?
You know
what I mean, though?
          And pretentious--
          and pretentious.
There's a great
"Moby-Dick" illustrated
that I think you'd love.
There's a pop-up whale
at the end.
               Fuck you.
Didn't I give you a whale?
I feel like I gave you,
like, a copper figurine
for your birthday
that I got at that--
Wow.
You carry that with you?
   I don't know.
   It's, like, a little
   good luck charm or something.
Well, it's working.
          Is it?
          I don't know if it is.
Yeah.
Yeah, Mr. Fancy LA Agent.
I wish I kept
that whale for myself.
  It's not that big of a deal.
  He's not that big of an agent.
<i> I think it's incredible.</i>
I always knew you'd
do something amazing
with your life.
I'm proud of you, Milo.
              Do you wanna
              get out of here?
        Those lobster cages
        can knock you right off.
                  What?
   Well, actually, they're
   called lobster pots,
    but they can
    knock these guys
    right off the deck.
They're real dangerous.
                    Oh.
        I think those are crabs.
        -<i> Where? </i>
        - E-everywhere.
     Oh, yeah,
     maybe they are.
             <i> No, they are.</i>
              So, how's Milo
              working out?
Good. He's definitely
doing his best,
  but he's been--
  he's trying.
                   Good.
          Mm.
               I love you.
   I love you, too.
           I really love you.
       Thank you.
            God, I can't believe
            he's 16.
It's strange, man.
Having a kid that old.
He just got his license.
I'm like, "Really?
I'm old enough to have
a kid who can drive?"
    My God.
            Does he know about
            me and you?
No, no, God, no.
He knows I used to teach
and, uh, sometimes he asks
why I stopped, you know,
but...
          <i> What do you tell him?</i>
That it wasn't my thing.
            I'm sorry, Rich.
No, Milo, you don't
ever have to apologize.
  You didn't
  do anything wrong.
  You understand me?
               Okay.
           Look, I know--
           I know what happened
           was weird and illegal
           and shit,
           but it really meant
           something to me.
            <i> And we're adults.</i>
            Well, I'm--
            I'm an adult.
          God, I feel like
          a freshman asking
          a senior to the dance.
That's part of the problem.
      There's--
      there's a...
freshman/senior dynamic
between us.
       There doesn't have to be.
<i> Milo, get up.</i>
       <i> Lance is leaving</i>
       <i> in 10 minutes.</i>
         Milo?
       Milo, is that your phone?
Oh, shit,
what time is it?
            It's after 9:00.
Fuck,
I'm late for work.
            You and me both.
               Um, ahem.
              So, here.
"Sunrise in Manhattan."
         It's a romantic comedy.
About what,
Balzac and Foucault?
         No, it's actually
         pretty straightforward.
       <i> like, Jennifer Aniston</i>
       <i> or Kate Hudson.</i>
          And I don't want
          to be presumptuous,
       but I thought, you know,
       if you wanted to read it
      and maybe if you liked it,
      you could pass it along
      to your agent?
     Yeah, okay.
   - Yeah, totally.
     Yeah, I could totally...
   -<i> Cool.</i>
   pass it on if--
   I'll read it.
            - Cool.
            - Yeah.
            I kind of--
            I need you to leave.
  Okay.
  Yeah, sure.
     - Last night was fun.
     - Yeah.
  Kind of a blast
  from the past.
             Yeah, um, make sure
             the door locks
             when you close it.
   Greetings,
   Ms. Dean.
What brings you
around these parts?
  It was a mistake.
All right.
  I mean it,
  the whole thing.
   Fine.
Is that all?
   Yeah.
   Yeah, that's all.
     What are you doing?
                 No, Billy,
                 I'm serious.
                     No.
 Bull-- bullshit!
Bullshit! Bullshit!
    Bullshit.
    Bullshit.
   Bull... shit.
                    Hello.
Where were you
this morning?
             Uh, well,
             Kevin had a friend,
             and last night,
             I got lucky.
     Well, you missed work,
     so, not cool.
            I was a little late.
            Lance understood.
   You have to get your shit
        together, Milo.
      That is a very interesting
      statement coming from you.
        - You know what?
        - What?
                     Wow.
      What are you doing?
                      Milo.

        Hi.
Uh, is your dad home?
             Yeah, hold on.
           Dad, some guy's
           at the door for you.
I'm sorry,
I thought you had him--
          What are you doing?
          You can't be here.
         That's my kid in there.
    Okay, I thought
    you only had him
    on the weekends.
           I have a life, Milo.
           A whole life.
       Give me a shot
       of Cuervo, please.
      Can I have
      another one, please?
<i> Hey.</i>
                What are you
                doing up here?
      I'm waiting for you,
      Mr. Big Officer Man.
             The fuck you say?
<i> Thank you.</i>
  <i> Thank you very much.</i>
        No problem.
        Take care, now.
                  Thanks.
Maggie, don't freak out.
             What is going on?
You wouldn't understand.
         Try me.
         You might be surprised.
  I get depressed
  about my life
and I do stupid things.
That's it.
          We all get sad
          about our lives, Milo.
        That doesn't mean we go
        jumping off of rooftops.
I wasn't gonna jump.
         Okay, well,
         how do I know that?
  Okay, I'm sorry.
              I can't
              take this, Milo.
             I can't right now.
             I can't.
  Hey, I'm sorry.
Do you remember
Justin Meyer in eighth grade?
Jock, asshole, he used to
fuck with me all the time?
Dad, he told me--
he said, "Guys like Justin--
like, high school is the best
it's ever gonna get for them.
 They're gonna peak
 in high school,
and the rest of their life
is just gonna be...
 a disappointment."
And that kids like me--
  that I would soar
  after high school.
  <i> And, in fact,</i>
  <i> I would sit there,</i>
I would fast-forward
10 years into the future
and I would think about
our high school reunion
and seeing Justin,
and he would just be
this fat, balding guy
who, you know,
is the assistant manager
at some sporting goods store,
and-- and I would be
this famous actor
who lives in LA or New York
and I have this
beautiful boyfriend.
  And I'm happy.
 Do you know I looked
 Justin up online?
 And do you know
 what he's doing now?
He's an electrician,
and he has
two beautiful daughters
 and a pretty wife.
  And he's happy.
And it turns out that--
it just turns out that
I'm the one that peaked
in high school.
You know, if that's not
depressing, then...
         So, that's it, sweetie?
           You're not
           a famous actor?
      'Cause I got news for you.
      No one's a famous actor.
   George Clooney's
   a famous actor.
   Okay, George Clooney,
   I guess that's one exception.
        <i> But the rest of us</i>
        <i> are just walking around</i>
              trying not
              to be disappointed
              with the way
              that our lives
              turned out.
            And either we find
            a way to deal or...
             I need to know
            you're not gonna
            check out on me.
    I'll do my best.
  What?
  Ugh.
  Ugh.
  What are you doing?
         It's gotta be
       in here somewhere.
     Oh, my God.
         Wow.
             Oh, here it is!
             I found it!
Oh, my God.
You still have that thing?
       - We're going out.
       - What?
   It is Halloween,
   Lance is at fantasy football,
     I say you put on something
     pretty and/or freaky.
Preferably both.
     Yeah.
I can do this
               better myself.
      - No, I wanna do it.
      - Mm-hmm.
         <i> ¶ Secret... ¶</i>
   Okay.
                  Tell me if you
                  don't like it.
     I will tell you immediately
     if I don't like it.
                      Ah!
                  Is that
                  a good scream?
        That was a great scream.
        I love it.
                Oh, my God.
                I can't believe
                it still fits.
         - I know.
         - Look at me.
          You have better legs
          than I do, by the way.
              Oh, I have a body
              like a frog.
        - No, you don't.
        - Yes, I do.
            What does that mean?
    Just a big belly
    and long arms and long legs.
Just like--
     <i> ¶ I've got a secret</i>
     <i> and I can't explain ¶</i>
        <i> ¶ All the time</i>
  <i> I've waited for this day ¶</i>

   <i> I was never in doubt... ¶</i>
<i>-  Oh, Michelle Waller. </i>
<i> Uh-huh?</i>
Pregnant again,
baby number three.
      - Baby number three?
      - Yeah.
    - Shit, I didn't even
      know she was married.
    - Yeah.
<i> We haven't done the</i>
 <i> cemetery walk since Dad died.</i>
<i> I know.</i>
  Oh, my God,
  watch your step.
- - God, it has not changed a bit.
I had my first
wine cooler here.
       - With who?
       - Jenny Cokeland.
That makes sense.
     Yeah.
              Oh, wow.
   Dad loved Halloween.
             Who can blame him?
- Scram.
-     -  Rawr.
       - Get outta here.
       - Rawr.
          What, are you deaf?
I'm not deaf.
It's Halloween, assholes.
- Fucking people.
  Oh, my God.
    Wait, what was the name
         of the-- the--
    adolescent psychiatrist
     that they assigned us?
      - What was her name?
      - Oh, um, shit.
     -<i> Mary? </i>
     - Uh, Mamie Mortimer.
  - Mamie Mortimer.
  - Mamie Mortimer
   and her fucking journals.
                 Giant sweaters.
What was
with those sweaters?
Huge!
She's not a big woman.
         Every day was Christmas
         for Mamie Mortimer.
         Oh, my God.
         "Did you write that
         in your journal?"
"There's nothing that can't
be solved by journaling."
           "Oh, your dad died?
           Put it in a journal.
           You forgot about it,
           didn't ya?"
           She had
           a tough gig, though.
          I mean, we were not--
          we were not good kids.
         I mean, what do you do
         to two kids whose dad--
  You make them
  keep a journal.
       God, we were ungrateful
       bastards, though. Right?
Speak for yourself.
I was an angel.
I don't know what
you're talking about.
                Maggie.
          - "Maggie."
          -<i> Maggie.</i>
           Let me-- oh, wait.
           Let me see it.
      What?
       I want to see it.
             <i> Oh, what is that,</i>
             <i> a new place?</i>
No, it's always
been here.
              Oh, there she is,
              dancing away.
Of course she is.
Did you think
I got rid of it?
               I don't know.
               You're a tricky
               bird, Magpie.
   <i> ¶ 'Cause I've never seen</i>
<i> anything like this before... ¶</i>
How'd we go 10 years
without talking?
        Oh, it's probably not
        worth talking about now.
   Probably not.
         <i> ¶ And he says</i>
      <i> he cannot help me ¶</i>
      <i> ¶ 'Cause he doesn't</i>

           at a urinal
           is actually
           not that hard.
I'm gonna go.
            Do you want
            another round?
                 I'm gonna go.
Hey, hey.
Wait up, Maggie.
Hey, what's going on?
              Kevin Clancy?
         Kevin Clancy moved
         to Miami six years ago.
  He was in town
  for the weekend.
  What?
  What is this?
          I saw your cell phone.
      Uh, you have a missed call
      from Rich Levitt.
            Are you sleeping
            with him?
Some of us have our secrets
and some of us have
our reasons, Maggie.
                   Wow.
   So, what, you're still
   attracted to child molesters?
                  Is that it?
He's not
a child molester.
       You were 15 and he
       was your English teacher.
You didn't see
the way he treated me.
 - He wanted to fuck you.
 - Who are you to judge, okay?
You've had boyfriends
since you were in the
fifth grade, okay?
I was 15. I had never
been kissed before.
      - So what if he was
        my teacher?
      - So what?
He made me feel good!
He made me feel good
about myself!
     You know what?
     You wanna go hang out
     with Rich Levitt, go ahead.
             I am not gonna
             stop you.
            But when all that
            shit went down,
          I know, looking back,
          I was right.
        And I can't feel guilty
        about it anymore.
           And it could've
           been a lot worse.
          He could've gone
          to fucking jail, Milo.
          Do you realize that?
        He is lucky that we
        dealt with this quietly.
        And I know you blame me,
        and I know you think
        I ruined this
        blossoming relationship
        between you and him.
        I know you think
        I ruined his life,
        that I ruined your life,
             <i> but I did</i>
             <i> what I had to do.</i>
Look, it had nothing
to do with you.
            That is bullshit.
            You're my brother.
        And we're supposed to
        be there for each other.
             <i> And if you don't</i>
             <i> get that by now,</i>
        then, I don't know,
        I guess I'll talk to you
        in another 10 years.
        - Maggie, wait.
        - This sucks.
          I was having such
          a good night with you.
            Sunday,
       Monday, Tuesday...
       Sunday, Monday...
           oh, shit.
       - Morning, chief.
       - Morning.
      Well, looks like your sis
      is down for the count.
    I think she's got, like,
    food poisoning or something.
      Right, or something.
      Maybe we should have
         a dude's day.
    - A what?
    - You know, dude's day.
      I think your version
         of dude's day
  and my version of dude's day
     are totally different.
           <i> ¶ I said,</i>
   <i> "Hey, the time has come ¶</i>
   <i> ¶ To throw the work away</i>
    <i> and have some fun"... ¶</i>
           Oh, shit.
Oh, shit!
Come on, man.
You almost had it that time.
Lance, this harness has my balls
     in my fucking throat.
    Can I please come down?
         It's all part
       of the experience,
           buddy boy.
      The only good thing
     about this experience
  is that every guy in here's
           gorgeous.
Yeah, it's great here, man.
You're surrounded by
a bunch of hunks.
It's beautiful.
<i> Come on,</i>
<i> you gotta use the pain.</i>
<i> Get inspired by it.</i>
  What are you, some sort of,
      like, climbing Nazi?
I just believe in you,
that's all.
Come on, I saw you out there
working at the park.
You got it in you, dude.
I believe in you.
You're such a piece
        of shit, Lance.
 Yeah, awesome.
 Awesome.
 <i> Just keep doing it</i>
 <i> just like that, man.</i>
 That's what I'm talking about!
         Boo-ya, dude!
        - To dude's day.
        - To dude's day.
           I gotta tell you,
           you were channeling
           my middle school
           PE teacher out there.
    Yeah, you were
    into it, huh?
 - Mm-hmm. Yeah, it was very--
  you're very motivating.
 - Thank you.
   You're gonna be
   a good dad someday.
   That was good.
         <i> Thanks, man.</i>
           It's funny
     'cause all my buddies,
 they're scared shitless about
  the whole fatherhood thing,
     and, yeah, I just know
     that I'm ready for it.
          <i> That's why</i>
   <i> the whole pregnancy thing</i>
     has been frustrating,
           you know?
      Just wanna make sure
     I'm not firing blanks,
           you know?
                  Right.
        <i> Guess I'm just</i>
      <i> a little paranoid.</i>
    Have-- have you noticed
  her acting a little strange
         at all lately?
           Like, uh--
          I mean, uh--
        uh, I don't know
          what I mean.
  I know
  what you mean, yeah.
  It'll all happen in Hawaii.
       That's how I feel.
        Just in between
        the trade winds
       and the palm trees
      and the people and,
    you know, exotic spices.
         Yeah.
          Maybe we'll
      do it in a hammock.
         Meh.
      Hawaii's definitely
      baby-making country.
              Heh.
    You know, Maggie
    can be very...
    s-secretive.
<i> she would hide cigarettes</i>
<i> and things like that</i>
<i> around the house.</i>
 You know, places you
 wouldn't think to look.
Maybe there's
some medication or something
that's affecting things.
    Just a thought.
      Yeah, I don't think
    Maggie'd hide something
       like that from me.
                   I'm sure
                   you're right.
        Yeah?
Hey, miss, do you
need help with anything?
            Yeah, you know what?
               I'm-- I-- I--
               I just, um--
             I'm a little late.
         But not seriously late,
         just a little.
        But I'm-- you know what?
        I don't need this.
            I'm fine, thanks.
         Thank you
         for putting that back.
                Thanks.
          What else did I need?
<i> ...puked all over</i>
          <i> the field.</i>
         <i> Maggie Dean?</i>
It's Carlie Van der Hoff.
  <i> Garfield High?</i>
        - Yeah, hi.
        -<i> Yeah, my God,</i>
        <i> </i> how are you?
     -<i> I'm fine. </i>
     - Oh, this is Cullen.
       - Say hi, Cullen.
       - Hi.
   <i> He's the oldest</i>
   <i> of my rug rats.</i>
   Yeah,
   but look at you.
                Are you
                visiting family?
     No, no,
     I live here.
           - Really?
           - Yeah.
   That's so weird
   that we've never run
   into each other.
   -<i> Yeah. </i>
   - I'm at the school
    employees credit union.
        - Mom.
        - Cullen, hush.
<i> If you're bored,</i>
<i> go wait in the car.</i>
  - Oh, I'm gonna be leaving.
  - Beat it.
  - Kiss my ass!
  - Hey, you watch it, mister!
      Back at ya!
   Ugh, gosh,
   what a little shit.
Can you believe kids today?
The attitudes.
    Do you have kids?
              No.
Ah, well, you're lucky
because they are little shits.
             So, how are you?
             How's Milo?
             Tell me everything.
           Um, I'm--
         I'm all right.
       - You got married?
       - I did.
     Of course, you always
    had so many boyfriends.
           <i> Oh, boy.</i>
      Are-- are you okay?
     Carlie, can you, um--
  can you give me one second?
        -<i> Yeah. </i>
        - Be right back.
Thank you, thank you.
          Oh, thank...
      It's over.
     No, for real.
             Hi.
   Honey, what's
   going on here?
          Um...
      those are old.
Okay, well,
the prescription says
that they're
from last month, so...
        Honey,
        I'm sorry that...
             Ahem.
                Listen, um...
            If you don't want to
            have kids right now,
            we can talk
            about that, okay?
            You don't need
            to lie to me.
          I...
        Sweetie, you're freaking
        me out right now.
I'm a sick person,
Lance.
             What do you mean?
I've been with other men
since we've been married.
      <i> Three.</i>
    Three other men.
    <i> I wasn't in love</i>
    <i> with any of them.</i>
     <i> I know that</i>
     <i> doesn't matter.</i>
       I'm so sorry.
        <i> I'm sorry.</i>
     Lance?
        Look, he was confused.
        I felt terrible for him.
      - Hey!
      - You had no right!
          Things were gonna
          crash down eventually.
No, you were just
trying to get back at me.
               I was trying
               to help you.
You just
ruined my marriage.
        - What marriage?
        - Fuck you.
  Look, you're miserable,
  and if you're too chickenshit
  to do anything about it,
     - then I will.
     - Oh, so, you know
      what's best for me?
         Yes, you're my sister.
         We're supposed to help
         each other out.
      - You said that.
      - This is different!
     - How?
     - We are adults.
       This is my marriage.
        If you think that's
        a marriage, then you're
        fucking nuts, okay?
I'm sorry.
Enjoy your marital bliss.
             Okay, yeah, go.
             Leave anyway.
             This is not
             working out.
    You know what
    the sad thing is?
Is that we're a good team.
      Oh, yeah, and you'd be
      a real hoot to have around
              if you weren't
              such a fuckup.
We're both fuckups, okay?
And I'm tired
of you acting like
you're the healthy one
 and I'm your
 special needs kid.
           Oh, what does it even
           matter anymore, Milo?
           You got your revenge.
           You got it.
I was trying to
lay it out on the table.
That's what I was trying to do.
      - You wanna lay it
        out on the table?
      - Yes!
          Okay, then, go for it.
 - You're emotionally unstable.
 - You're a prick.
You need
professional help.
          Oh, and this coming
          from a guy who just
          tried to kill himself.
Maybe I should try
fucking all my problems away.
         Well, maybe next time
         you should cut deeper.
Oh, no.
     No, no,
     no, no, no, no.
             Shit.
             Fuck.
            Come on.
             Fuck.
       Come on, come on,
            come on.
          There we go.
          There we go.
       Yeah, yeah, yeah.
         There you go.
            Come on!
            Come on!
  Hey, I know I'm not supposed
  to come over here or anything,
    but I want to talk to you,
    and I think you owe me that.
           You owe me.
           That's what I think.
Listen, I'm sure your sister
didn't mean what she said.
               So, how do you
               make this work?
         Like, how do you juggle
         a girlfriend and a son
         with guys like me?
 Well, there aren't
 a lot of guys like you.
                 Gee, thanks,
                 Teach.
  No, not-- I mean,
  it's not a pattern.
              Are you gay?
       I...
 I can make it work
 with Melinda,
 and I really want to.
             Well, good luck
             with that.
       Don't-- can you--
      what are you fucking
          doing, man?
         That's not why
       I came over here.
     - Milo...
     - What am I, some sort
       of forbidden fruit?
         what am I, like,
         a blow-up doll?
         What am I to you?
  I treated you terribly.
  I know that.
        But...
it's not because
I don't care or because...
  I don't respect you...
...or because I don't
  love you.
   It's because
   I'm a big pussy.
      That's it.
    I'm just a huge,
    pathetic pussy.
 I could never be you.
You can crash on the couch,
if you want.
     Oh, um...
  did you, by chance,
  read my script?
                 Yeah.
        <i> And?</i>
              It's great.
          I'll definitely
          give it to my agent.
<i> ...once again, this is the 528</i>
         <i> leaving Nyack</i>

- Are you okay?
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
       You're okay.
       All right, say something.
       Just say something.
         - I'm okay.
         - You're okay.
          You're okay, Jesus.
          You're okay.
