They can trade it

Everybody's happy.
If you want, you could
run the company for me.
Let me understand.
They'd put up

I'd do all the work.
What, if you don't mind
my asking, would you do?
I'd make sure it's known

I'd see that it had

He's on the list.
He is?
Well, let's find him.
I'm sorry.
You can't have him.
He's on the list. If he were an essential
worker he would not be on the list.
I'm talking to a clerk.
What is your name?
Sir, the list is correct.
I didn't ask you
about the list.
I asked you your name.
Klaus Tauber.
Tauber.
<i>Hauptscharführer, this gentleman

My plant manager is
somewhere on this train.
If it leaves with him on it,
it'll disrupt production

<i>MAN ON LOUDSPEAKER: Achtung,

Yes, sir. Itzhak Stern.

(WHISTLE BLOWING)

This one, that one.
(TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING) It's
the inconvenience to the list.
It's the paperwork.
I somehow left my

I tried to explain them
it was a mistake, but...
I'm sorry, it was stupid!
What if I got here
five minutes later?
Then where would I be?
<i>Sacrean, sacrean end tzukeer.</i>
<i>Tzukeer end sacrean.</i>
I woke up from
a dream this morning.
I was broke and sharing a room
with 12 people I didn't know,
only to discover I
was broke and sharing
a room with 12
people I didn't know.
(CHUCKLING) You laugh about it?
I have to laugh.
You are living behind walls.
The walls I can deal with. It's the
restrictions to my life I'm tired of.
Those walls keep them out.
That's all I care about.
I like it here. There's
a kind of, I don't know,
ancestral squalor to it all.
You are a slave to these people.
No one envies us anymore.
I'm smart.
Oh, yes, you're smart.
You're a real genius.
You had your chance.
Today, today I actually found
time to organize a thought.
I can't remember
the last time I did that.
When's the last
time we did this?
When's the last time
we stood around and talked?
No one ordered me
onto a truck today.
No one took my
business away from me.
You don't really
have a business to take.
There's nowhere down from here.
This is it.
This is the bottom.
The ghetto is liberty.
This street divides the ghetto
just about in half.
Right side, Ghetto A, civil employees,
industrial workers, and so on.
Left side,
Ghetto B, surplus labor,
the elderly and infirm, mostly.
Which is where you
will want to start.
Do you have any questions, sir?
<i>Ja, why is the top down?
I'm fucking freezing.</i>
KUNDE: We expect a labor
force of 25,000 to 30,000.
Segregated, of course. The men
in the barracks near the quarry.
The women on
the other side of the wire.
GOETH: My place is where?
There, sir.
There?
Yes, the villa.
You call that a villa?
Their synagogue,
can you see it?
That's not a villa.
We're planning to turn it
into the camp stables.
It's a house.
GOETH: What's that over there?
KUNDE: Kindergarten.
Fifty-one.
And we have a dentist,
shoemaker, practical physicians.
There they are, sir.
(SNIFFS) Hmm.
One of you is
a very lucky girl.
There is an opening
for a job away from all
this backbreaking
work at my new villa.
(SNIFFS)
Uh...
Which of you has
domestic experience?
<i>Ja, on second thought, I don't
really want someone else's maid.</i>
All those annoying
habits I have to undo.
(CHUCKLES) I don't want
to give you my cold.
What's your name?
Helen Hirsch.
What?
Helen Hirsch.
(COUGHING)
What? I can't hear.
Helen Hirsch.
<i>Ja.</i>
WOMAN: Take it all down!
(OFFICER BLOWS WHISTLE)
OFFICER: To work!
WOMAN: Take it down!
It is not safe!
She says the foundation was poured wrong.
She's got to take it down.
I told her it's the barracks,
not the fucking Hotel Europa.
Fucking Jew bitch engineer.
You fucking bitch!
<i>Herr Kommandant.
The entire foundation</i>
has to be torn
down and re-poured.
If not, there will be
at least a subsidence
at the southern
end of the barracks.
Subsidence, and then collapse.
And you are an engineer?
Yes.
My name is Diana Reiter.
I'm a graduate of civil engineering
from the University of Milan.
An educated Jew,
like Karl Marx himself.
<i>Unterscharführer!
Jawohl?</i>
Shoot her.
What?
(GASPS)
<i>Herr Kommandant,
I'm only trying to do my job.</i>
<i>Ja, I'm doing mine.</i>

We are not going to have
arguments with these people.
Okay.
No. Shoot her here,
on my authority.
It will take more than that.
GOETH: I'm sure you're right.
Take it down, re-pour it, rebuild it.
Like she said.
We have more to see, but we have
only one more hour of light.

<i>GOETH: Today is history.</i>
<i>Today will be remembered.</i>

<i>They took hold.</i>
<i>They prospered in business,

<i>They came here with nothing.</i>

No. No, thank you.
So, what can I do for you?
They say that no one dies here.
They say your

They say you are good.

Everyone.
My name is Regina Perlman,
not Elsa Krause.
I've been living in Krakow on false

My parents are in Plaszow.

Chana and Jakob Perlman.
They are older people. They are
killing older people now in Plaszow.
They bury them up
in the forest. Look,
I don't have any money.
I borrowed these clothes.
I'm begging you. Please.
Please bring them here.
I don't do that.
You've been misled.
I ask one thing.
Whether or not the worker
has certain skills.
That's what I ask
and that's what I care about.
My father is an importer,
not a metalworker.

Send them all!
His place is a haven, didn't you know?
It's not a factory.
It's not an enterprise
of any kind.
It's a haven for
rabbis and orphans
and people with no
skills whatsoever!
(SIGHS)
You think I don't
know what you're doing?
You're so quiet all the time.
I know, I know!
Are you losing money?
That's not the point!
So the point is?
It's dangerous!
It's dangerous to me!
You have to understand. Goeth
is under enormous pressure.
You have to think of
it in his situation.
He's got this
whole place to run.
He's responsible for everything
here, all these people.
He's got a lot of
things to worry about.
And he's got the war which
brings out the worst in people.
Never the good, always the bad.
Always the bad.
But in normal circumstances he wouldn't
be like this. He'd be all right.
There'd just be the good
aspects of him, which...
(CHUCKLES)
He's a wonderful crook.
A man who loves good food, good
wine, the ladies, making money...
Killing.
He can't enjoy it.
Bejski told me the other day,
somebody escaped
from a work detail
outside the wire.
<i>Goeth lined up everybody from
the missing man's barracks.</i>
<i>He shot the man to the left of
Bejski, the man to the right of him.</i>
<i>He walked down the line shooting
every other man with a pistol.</i>
Twenty-five.
What do you want
me to do about it?
Nothing, nothing.
We're just talking.
"Perlman."
Perlman!
Husband and wife.
Jakob and Chana Perlman!
Have Goldberg bring them over.

<i>Herr Direktor, I was just helping
Lisiek to find something</i>
<i>to clean the stains from the
Herr Kommandant's bathtub.</i>
Go clean it.
<i>Pardon me, Herr Direktor.</i>
(SCHINDLER CHUCKLES)
You don't have to
report to me, Helen.
You know who I am? Hmm?
(WHISPERING) I'm Schindler.
Of course.
I have heard, and
you have been here before.
Here, why don't you
keep this someplace?
Go on, take it.
I get extra food here.
Well, if you don't want to eat it, trade it.
Or give it to Lisiek.
Why not build yourself up?
My first day here, he beat me
because I threw out
the bones from dinner.
He came down to the basement
at midnight, and he...
He asked me where they were.
For his dogs, you understand.
I said to him,
I don't know how I say this.
I never could say it now,
I said to him,
"Why are you beating me?"
He said, "The reason
I beat you now
is because you
ask why I beat you."
I know your sufferings, Helen.
It doesn't matter.
I have accepted them.
Accepted them?
One day he will shoot me.
No, no, no, he won't shoot you.
I know. I see things.
We were on the roof on Monday,
young Lisiek and I,
<i>and we saw the Herr Kommandant
come out of the from door</i>
and down the steps by the
patio, right there below us,
and there on the steps
he drew his gun and he
shot a woman who
was passing by.
A woman carrying a bundle.
Through the throat.
Just a woman on her way
somewhere, you know?
She was no fatter or thinner
or slower or faster
than anyone else,
and I couldn't
guess what had she done.
<i>The more you see of
the Herr Kommandant,</i>
the more you see there is no set
rules that you can live by.
You can't say to yourself, "If I
follow these rules, I will be safe."
He won't shoot you because
he enjoys you too much.
He enjoys you so much he won't
even let you wear the star.
He doesn't want
anyone else to know
it's a Jew he's enjoying.
He shot the woman
from the steps
because she meant
nothing to him.
She was one of a series,
neither offending
or pleasing him.
But you, Helen.
It's all right. It's not
that kind of a kiss.
(SOBBING)
Thank you.
Shh.
Here.
Right. The wine.
Wonderful party, Amon.
Thank you.
(GROANS)
Why do you drink
that motor oil?
Hmm? I send you good
stuff all the time.
Your liver's going to explode
like a hand grenade.
You know, I look at you.
(SNIFFS)
I watch you.
(SIGHS)
You're never drunk.
(SNIFFS) Oh, that's...
That's real control.
Control is power.
That's power.
SCHINDLER:
Is that why they fear us?
We have the fucking power to
kill, that's why they fear us.
They fear us because we have
the power to kill arbitrarily.
A man commits a crime,
he should know better.
We have him killed, and we
feel pretty good about it.
Or we kill him ourselves
and we feel even better.
That's not power, though.
That's justice.
It's different than power.
Power is when we have
everyjustification to kill,
and we don't.
You think that's power?
That's what the emperors had.
A man stole something,
he's brought in
before the emperor,
he throws himself down on the
ground, he begs for mercy.
He knows he's going to die.
And the emperor pardons him.
This worthless man.
He lets him go.
I think you are drunk.
That's power, Amon.
That is power.
Amon the Good.
I pardon you. (LAUGHS)
<i>GOETH: What do they want?</i>
<i>STERN: I don't know, but they're in

Does it?

Yes, you're right.

The trains arrived and the people
were driven out with clubs.
They were lined up in front
of two big warehouses.
One was marked "Cloak Room,"
and the other "Valuables."
And there they
were made to undress.
A Jewish boy handed them pieces of
string to tie their shoes together.
They shaved their hair.
They told them it was needed to
make something
special for U-boat crews.
And then they were herded
down a big corridor
to bunkers with Stars
of David on the doors
and signs that said
"Bath and Inhalation Room."
SS gave them soap.
They told them to
breathe all the time
because it's good
for disinfecting.
And then they gassed them.
Mila, why soaps?
So that they would
agree to go in, I think.
Come on, Mila, stop it. Your bedtime
stories are scaring everyone.
Yeah. You know
it's ridiculous.
I cannot believe it.
I didn't say I believed it.
I said I heard it.
From who?
From somebody who heard it
from someone who was there.
You know, if they were there,
they would have been gassed.
Yes.
It doesn't make any sense.
We're their workforce.
What sense does it make
to kill your own workforce?
To go to all this trouble of
assembling a workforce only to...
No, it can't be true.

You'll receive

Budzyn, under my command,

The prisoners, however...
Excuse me.
They would have rather
been somewhere else.
SCHINDLER: The train with the

But it's only a short walk

Cough for me, mother.
They say to fall against

Don't kill yourself

If you do, you'll never know

Sir?
Good morning.
A mistake has been made. We

We work for Oskar Schindler.
We are Schindler Jews.
Who is Oskar Schindler?
He had a factory in Krakow.
Enamelware.
A pot maker.
How old are you, mother?
You are not the only
industrialist who needs labor,
<i>Herr Schindler.</i>
I remember earlier this year,
IG Farben ordered
a trainload of Hungarians
for its chemical factory.
The train came in
through the archway
and the officer in charge of the
selection went immediately to work
and sent 2,000 of them
straight away to
Special Treatment.
It is not my task
to interfere with
the processes that
take place down here.
Why do you think I can help you
if I can't help IG Farben?
Allow me to express the reason.
I'm not making any
judgment about you.
It's just that I know
that in the coming months,
we're all going to
need portable wealth.
I could have you arrested.
I'm protected by powerful friends.
You should know that.
I do not say I
am accepting them.
All I say is, I'm not comfortable
with them on the table.
I have a shipment
coming in tomorrow.
I'll cut you 300 units from it.
New ones.
These are fresh.
The train comes,
we turn it around.
Mmm, yes, yes.
It's yours.
I understand.
I want these.
You shouldn't
get stuck on names.
That's right. It creates
a lot of paperwork.

Under Department "W" provisions
it is unlawful to kill a

If you shoot without thinking,
you go to prison, I get paid.
That's how it works.
So, there will be
no summary executions here.
There will be no interference
of any kind with production.
In hopes of ensuring
that, guards will
no longer be allowed
on the factory floor
without my authorization.
For your cooperation,
you have my gratitude.

You must be

It's a pleasure to meet you.
Emilie has volunteered

Very generous of you.
I know.
We need to talk
when you have a moment.
This is my wife, Stern. I don't
keep any secrets from my spouse.
Oskar, please, attend to business.
It's much more attractive.
Madam.
Hello.
What is it? We've received
an angry complaint
from the Armaments Board.
The artillery shells,
tank shells, rocket casings,
apparently all of them have
failed quality control tests.
That's to be expected.
Start-up problems.
This isn't pots and pans.
This is a precise business.
I'll write them a letter.
They're withholding payment.
Sure, so would I, so would you.
I wouldn't worry about it. We'll
get it right one of these days.
There's a rumor you've been going
around miscalibrating the machines.
They could shut us down,
send us back to Auschwitz.
I'll call around, find out
where we can buy shells.
Pass them off as ours.
I don't see the difference.
Whether they're made here
or somewhere else...
You don't see a difference?
I see a difference.
You'll lose a lot of money.
Fewer shells will be made.
Stern, if this factory
ever produces
a shell that can
actually be fired,
I'll be very unhappy-

<i>WINSTON CHURCHILL ON RADIO:
Yesterday morning, at 2:41 a.m.,</i>
<i>at General Eisenhower's
headquarters,</i>
<i>General Jodl signed the Act
of Unconditional Surrender</i>
<i>of all German land,
sea and air forces in Europe</i>
<i>to the Allied
Expeditionary Force</i>
<i>and simultaneously
to the Soviet High Command.</i>
<i>The German war is,
therefore, at an end.</i>
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
<i>(KNOCKING AT DOOR) But let us
not forget for a moment...</i>
I think it's time the guards
came into the factory.
<i>Japan,
with all her treachery...</i>
The unconditional surrender of
Germany has just been announced.
At midnight tonight,
the war is over.
Tomorrow you'll
begin the process
of looking for survivors
of your families.
In most cases,
you won't find them.
After six long years of murder,
victims are being mourned
throughout the world.
We've survived.
Many of you have come up to me
and thanked me.
Thank yourselves.
Thank your fearless Stern
and others among you
who worried about you
and faced death
at every moment.
I'm a member of the Nazi Party.
I'm a munitions manufacturer.
I'm a profiteer of slave labor.
I am a criminal.
At midnight you'll be free,
and I'll be hunted.
I shall remain with you until
five minutes after midnight,
after which time,
and I hope you'll forgive me,
I have to flee.
I know you have received
orders from our commandant,
which he has received
from his superiors,
to dispose of the population
of this camp.
Now would be the time to do it.
Here they are, they're all here.
This is your opportunity.
(PEOPLE MURMURING)
Or you could leave
and return to
your families as men
instead of murderers.
In memory of the countless
victims among your people,
I ask us to observe
three minutes of silence.
