GIRL: <i>For generations of high-schoolers,</i>
<i>you could only be a jock, a geek,</i>
<i>a princess, a bully
or a basket case.</i>
<i>But times have changed.</i>
<i>Jocks play video games.</i>
<i>Princesses are on antidepressants.</i>
<i>And geeks basically
run the country.</i>
<i>I thought we were living
in a brave new world,</i>
<i>a place without labels.</i>
<i>But every so often, there's that
one moment in high school</i>
<i>that changes your
perspective on everything</i>.
(BELL RINGS)
Ooh. Showtime.
GIRL: <i>And for me, it happened senior year,</i>
<i>about a month before homecoming.</i>
<i>I was cruising the halls
with my two best friends.</i>
Jess Harris.
I would bang her so hard
we'd both need helmets.
GIRL: <i>Yeah, that's not me.</i>
Casey Cordero.
- I would play "Call of Duty" with her...
- Yeah.
- All night.
- Wait, what?
And bang her hard too, to
the point of needing helmets.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- That too, yeah.
GIRL: <i>Nope, not me, either.</i>
Shaw's over. Just Bianca.
(BURPS)
BIANCA: <i>That's me.</i>
(WOMAN SCREAMING ON COMPUTER)
Martin Van Buren. Nickelback.
Antidisestablishmentarianism.
(PLAYING SIMPLE TUNE)
Ah?
Jess has the hottest ass.
Casey has the hottest rack.
Bianca, she has the hottest friends.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
(BELL RINGS)
Homecoming tickets, homecoming.
Hey, get your
homecoming tickets now.
- Half price now or double at the door.
- We're gonna be late.
Hey, Jess. Hey, Casey.
Homecoming tickets?
- Oh, we bought ours online.
- All right, cool. See you there.
- Thanks.
- And I will not be attending, so...
Oh, my God, you do this
before every dance.
Yeah, but I don't feel like going.
There's a Vincent Price marathon
on, so I gotta watch that.
- Who's that?
- Ugh.
Shit, there's Se√±or Gomez.
I'm failing Spanish.
(SPEAKS IN SPANISH)
(JESS & CASEY SPEAK IN SPANISH)
(IN SPANISH)
(IN SPANISH)
(IN ENGLISH)
Okay.
Mini Stalin, dead ahead.
BIANCA: <i>Meet Madison Morgan.</i>
<i>As she would tell you herself,
she's the hottest girl in school.</i>
<i>Even the gay guys wanna date her.</i>
I would totally bang
the shit out of her.
But I Wouldn't like it.
Love.
Sorry.
BIANCA: <i>So, yeah, she was a bitch.</i>
<i>Were we fake friends
with her? Kind o</i>f.
Girls, party at my place.
I'm sure you've heard of it.
Can you make sure you get an
insert shot of them opening it?
Yep, on it.
Oh, yeah, I'm doing a video about
the party for my YouTube channel.
Wow, wait, you're having
a party on a Wednesday?
- On a school night?
- Yeah, I can do that.
Damn, dude. All right.
Well, yeah, we're in.
Ooh, um...
Bianca, you have to have
an actual invite to get in,
and I only have a certain amount.
But, um, if anything
changes, I'll let you know.
- Problem solved.
- Oh, hey.
Look at that.
Wonderful. Heh. Mm.
BIANCA: Can't wait. Should
I bring anything or...?
We'll... Okay.
(BELL RINGS)
Anupam and Lena, where are
we on the school-lunch article?
Uh, we thought we would make it
about how the prices of ice cream
have gone up 15 cents
in the cafeteria and...
That's a bit vanilla. Pardon the pun.
But you're missing the
meat of the story.
Our school serves
pizza five days a week,
paid by taxpayer money
that is used to cover us
against pizza-induced diabetes.
Now, that's a school-lunch
story. Boom.
Copy that, circle it, write it.
Huh? Nailed it. I'm
so proud of me.
We came up with that idea
together, but mostly me.
Okay, next up, final
assignment, all right?
It's a doozy, but it's a
real feather in the cap
for any reporter worth their salt
that wants to comment on
the social life of this school.
Anyone?
Not all at once.
No one?
No one at all?
Any takers?
Bianca.
Just the gal I was hoping for.
Hello. Okay.
I want you to step out
of your comfort zone
and bring your special brand
of journalistic gravitas
to an article about homecoming.
(BIANCA GASPS)
Specifically, what
homecoming means to me.
I mean, not to me. I never went
to a dance when I was a kid.
- Kind of a nerd.
- Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Arthur, heh,
but, um, with all due respect, I'm...
You're honored and thrilled to
lend that Bianca Piper magic?
You wanna do your thing
and put some stuff in the
words and make it pop?
That's so nice of you.
You don't have to do that.
"No, you didn't. I didn't say..."
Yes, you did. And thank...
"No, I didn't, I didn't." Yes, you did.
And I thank you.
(BABBLES)
You did. And I thank you.
Yeah, that's not where
I was going with that.
I'm sorry, "What
Homecoming Means to Me"?
What are we, 5 years old?
- What is this?
- Look, I'm sorry, B.
I know it sucks, but
maybe it's the universe
telling you, you need to be there.
Please don't start with
the universe with me
this early in the morning, okay?
Everything and
everyone can suck it.
Okay, it's not the end of the world.
Ho, ho. Well, that's
easy for you to say.
- I don't have a date.
- JESS: I can fix that.
- Um... Jack Rebis.
- Mm. Tiny hands.
- JESS: Mark Warshaw?
- Smells like trash.
Charlie Piper.
My cousin Charlie Piper?
Well, people don't know that.
Okay, I will keep looking.
We'll find someone.
BIANCA: <i>Although Jess' menu
of dudes was never-ending,</i>
<i>there was only one guy
I wanted to be my date.</i>
<i>And that's him, Toby Tucker.</i>
<i>I couldn't work up the courage
to say three words to Toby.</i>
<i>No, literally, three words.</i>
Okay, bye.
Ugh.
BOY: Whoo! We're gonna kick some ass!
- Jeez.
- I'll see you later, bro.
BIANCA: <i>You know those
people you grow up with</i>,
<i>maybe you took baths with
them when you were little</i>,
<i>but now they just annoy
the shit out of yo</i>u?
<i>I give you Wesley Rush.</i>
- WESLEY: Hey, neighbor.
- Wesley.
Saw you watching some weird
Japanese horror movie last night.
Were you spying on me?
A, don't leave your curtains open,
and two, it's kind of hard to miss
a bunch of Japanese people
running and screaming
for their lives.
Looked horrible, by the
way, all that reading.
Those would be subtitles.
Super. Where are your girls at?
- Who wants to know?
- The only man in your life.
Mm, Wesley, you
wouldn't be in my life
if you were the only
man left on the planet.
Aw. Sticks and stones, B.
Speaking of stones, rock-hard abs.
- BIANCA: No, no.
- WESLEY: Touch them.
- No, no one wants that.
- WESLEY: Graze them.
Hey, there you are.
BIANCA: <i>Wesley and Madison
were known around school</i>
<i>as "the Relationship Strobe Light."</i>
<i>On again, off again,
a thousand times.</i>
Okay.
(COUGHS)
Oh. Bianca. Well, this is awkw...
Sorry, were you just hitting
on my ex-boyfriend?
No, no. Just having some
me time at my locker.
- He approached me.
- MADISON: Oh. Totally.
I agree. That could never happen.
I know you miss me.
That's a healthy thing
you've got going.
Later, B.
JESS: B, it's a party.
You should wear something cute.
Here. Lots of options for you.
How about this?
Pretty.
- What the hell is this, underwear?
- No, it's a camisole.
No? Not for you?
Okay. Um...
Ooh. How about this? It's a little
darker, kind of sexy. Hmm?
Fine. Although I did hear Toby's
gonna be at the party tonight.
Oh, like that would matter.
I mean, it's not like she's
gonna say anything to him.
- Excuse me, I might.
- Mm?
Maybe I'll, you know...
(BIANCA MURMURS INDISTINCTLY)
Yeah, on second thought,
I think I'm just gonna stick
with the old lucky party shirt.
- Wait for it.
- CASEY: Bianca, don't do it.
- Huh?
- CASEY: B.
Says it on there.
- No.
- Mm-mm.
- BIANCA: And, you know, maybe...
- No.
- I'll round it outwith old trusty...
- CASEY: Not the flannel.
- Nice muted tones.
- No.
WOMAN: That is not a good look.
This is a good look.
BIANCA: <i>And that's my mom.</i>
<i>Three years ago my dad left her,
and she did not handle it well.</i>
(SOBBING)
BIANCA: <i>But one night divine inspiration struck.</i>
<i>You can expect to go
through five stages.</i>
- <i> The first is denial.
- No way, because I'm not dying.</i>
- <i> Second is anger.
- Why, you little... Agh!</i>
HIBBERT: <i>After that comes fear.</i>
- HOMER: <i>What's after fear?</i>
- HIBBERT: <i>Bargaining.</i>
HOMER: <i>Get me out of this.
I'll make it worth your while.</i>
- <i> Finally, acceptance.
- Well, we all gotta go sometime.</i>
BIANCA: <i>And just like that,
she became Dottie Piper,</i>
<i>local celebrity to the
40-and-over self-help crowd,</i>
<i>all-around rock star
and occasional mom.</i>
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
All right, let me tell you something.
I was in the depression
stage about my ex,
but I combined my
ex with "depression,"
and I got "expression."
if you girls wanna really
knock the boys out,
you should project boldness
with a power pantsuit combo.
I'm gonna look like
Hillary Clinton, Mom.
I know, right?
Okay, kids, enjoy your party. I love you.
I have another seminar to prep for.
- BIANCA: Okay, bye.
- DOTTIE: Bye.
(ALI DEE'S "MAKE THAT BOOTY POP" PLAYING)
- CAITLYN: I love your outfit.
- Caitlyn, can you make sure
you get a shot of the desserts?
Jess, hair's looking good.
Ugh. She needs a blow-out.
Here, Kelly, take the blue ones.
They're sugar-free, and I know you're
trying to watch that kind of thing.
(ALL CHEERING)
What?
You've got to be kidding me.
(NOVA ROCKAFELLER'S "MADE IN GOLD" PLAYING)
- MADISON: Wesley?
- Agh!
Caitlyn.
Hey, Mads.
Really? With this? Does she
have to film everything?
Wesley, I'm what's
known as pre-famous.
My life is an audition for reality TV.
So, yeah, um, I need
to chronicle everything.
That was a good take for
me. Get a wide shot too.
Hey, Caitlyn, take five.
- Thanks.
- Ew.
This is why we are not dating, okay?
Because you, my friend,
are a juvenile dipshit.
- I could be dating college guys...
- WESLEY: Yeah.
Or famous people or BO-year-olds.
That sounds like an awesome
episode of Dateline.
Enjoy those saggy balls.
Fine, I Will. Ugh.
BOY: Come on, man.
Guys, I don't see Toby.
- I don't know where Toby is.
- Come dance with us.
BIANCA: Do you think he didn't come?
- Party pooper.
- No, no, guys, I don't dance.
JESS: Come on, B. Come on, B.
- BIANCA: No, no, no.
- Yeah, you do. Come on, you dance.
You do. Come on.
- Come on.
- Okay.
- There you go.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Ooh, look at those moves. Whoo!
- See?
- Oh, man, all this dancing
made me so thirsty.
I'm gonna get a drink.
JESS: B, really?
(JESS SIGHS)
(SINGING) L<i>et
you get away.</i>
<i>Now, don't go away.</i>
<i>My darling
Don't go away.</i>
WESLEY: Hey, Billy.
- No, just Bianca.
- Jesus.
Looking very handsome tonight.
Why, thank you.
Having fun at the party?
Yeah, actually, your girls are
looking incredible out there.
Have they asked about me?
When I told them
that you were here,
their eyes filled with this, like, sparkle,
you know, with, like, childlike wonder,
and then they just
started dancing together.
- It was kind of beautiful.
- Yeah, it was.
Do they do other things together
that I might be able to
join in on or just watch?
I'm kidding. Not kidding
at all. Tell me everything.
Yeah, it's actually not my
job to give you pervy intel
- on my best friends, but thanks.
- Well, I mean, it kind of is, though.
People ask you questions
about them, right,
because that's your
job as their DUFF.
Sorry, as their what?
DUFF. D-U-F-F.
Designated Ugly Fat Friend.
What did you just say to me?
It's not like a big deal, okay? I mean,
like, every group of friends has one.
The one who doesn't look as good,
thus making their friends look better.
The one who's approachable
and easy to talk to,
because no one's trying
to get in their pants.
And if you don't know who
it is, chances are it's you.
Say when. Say...
Okay, look, I didn't mean
it like that, all right? Urn...
The DUFF doesn't always have to
be some heinous beast, all right?
Take a look at Robin.
BIANCA: Robin's, like, super cute.
Okay, but her friends are super hot.
BIANCA: Oh, God, that is
such a guy thing to say.
Guys can be DUFFs too, okay?
You know my boy A.J.
freshman on the football team?
We're in chemistry together.
Now he's doing the second most
important job a DUFF can do,
acting as, like, the gatekeeper
to their better-looking friends.
The guy with the info people go
to before they make their move.
- Watch, watch.
- Is it true Wes is single?
Ahem. Uh, sure is, yeah.
Got it. Thanks, A.J. You're sweet.
- Hi.
- Hey, Wes.
See? She gets her info, he
gets to talk to a hot senior.
Even got a little action. I
didn't have to do anything.
It's kind of like us right now.
Excuse me, that is
not like us right now.
B, on an average day,
how many guys ask you
questions about Jess and Casey?
- I don't know. It's a fair amount.
- WESLEY: Okay.
On an average day, how many
guys ask you questions about you?
See? You friended
up, okay?
Good for you. Good talk. You
know what? Get back out there.
Have some...
(CROWD LAUGHING)
Hey, what the hell was that for?
Stupid Wes.
It's not even...
(BIANCA SCOFFS)
Really?
Oh, God.
WOMAN ON COMPUTER: <i>I am the DUFF.</i>
<i>Impress me to get to my friends.</i>
<i>I am the gatekeeper.</i>
I'm not the DUFF.
(BELL RINGS)
Hey, Duffy.
Shouldn't you be
working with a partner?
Shouldn't you be working at all?
Lab partner's got this.
BIANCA: Oh, boy. Clearly.
Bill Nye over there looks like
she's about to drink that acid.
I work alone.
- Take a hint.
- Why are you so grumpy?
You know, I should be mad at
you. You ruined my favorite shirt.
You called me fat and ugly, Wesley.
What? No, I didn't. I
called you the DUFF.
Yeah, excuse me.
It's just that stands for Designated
Ugly Fat Friend, dick face.
You can't take it literally, okay?
I mean, the DUFF doesn't
actually have to be fat or ugly.
You know, like Tony Romo,
he's a Dallas Cowboy.
It's not like he rides a horse, right?
I have no idea what the
hell you're talking about.
I'm just saying, I would
never call anyone fat or ugly.
Okay? That's
messed up.
But it's the word and it
stuck. It's a catchall.
Oh, my God. Get out of
here before I murder you.
- Are you kidding? Okay.
- I'll murder you.
B, where the hell'd you go?
Home. Wasn't feeling good.
Oh, well, you didn't
really miss much.
Yeah, except Jess making
out with Ryan Jensen,
the cops busting up the party,
and, like, everyone TP'ing
Rebecca Cutter's house.
She's right, it was pretty awesome.
Hello? Are
you okay?
Yeah, just get the food.
- Hey there, Jess and Casey.

Hey, Elaine.
Hey, you.
Hey, Jeffrey.

Hey, B, will you take a

I need a layman's opinion.
(BIANCA SCOFFS)
You're aware I'm a woman, right?
What? Oh, no. "Layman,"
it's just a phrase.
I just mean you're
not a fashion expert.
Oh, so I have bad style?
Whoa, someone's in
a mood. Lighten up.
Lighten up? Because
I'm so heavy?
Is there a problem?
Outside.
How could you guys not tell me this
whole time that I was your DUFF?
- Our what?
- Your Designated Ugly Fat Friend.
Yeah, yeah. Wesley
told me everything.
CASEY: Ha, ha. He can't even spell.
That's actually pretty
creative for Wes.
Since when do you care
what Wesley Rush says?
He says crazy stuff all the time.
Uh, because it makes sense.
I mean, why else would
two super-hot, popular girls
wanna be friends with
somebody like me?
It's because you're using me to
make yourselves look better.
Okay, just because you think one
of us is better-looking than you...
Oh, my God. There it is, there it
is. You know what? No, no, no.
I'm glad you said that,
because it makes what I'm
about to do a whole lot easier.
(CELL PHONES CHIME)
Yeah, go ahead and check them.
Did you just unfriend me?
You bet your ass I did.
Well, fine.
Then I am taking you
off of Instagram.
Well, hallelujah, okay?
I don't have to look at pictures of your
artisanal cappuccinos every morning.
How dare you? You
love those foam faces.
- They're foam-tastic.
- Shh.
Look, we're going through
something over here.
Guess what else.
Unfollowed y'all on Twitter.
Oh, perfect. No more of Bianca's
almost-ironic tweets for the day.
Heh. Oh, that's rich,
coming from this guy
who's RT'ing them all day long.
They're pity RTs.
You know what?
I'm taking you off of my We
Heart It and my Vine feed.
Oh, great, because I don't
like your loops, okay?
And you know what else? I'm
blocking your ass on Tumblr.
And you, you're off my Snapchat.
Well, fine.
- Fine.
- Fine.
I'm a free woman.

I'm so sorry, Susan.

you're suspended from the team.
WESLEY: Well, can't we talk
to Coach Grant about it?
Yeah, Coach Grant
agrees with my decision.
Okay, okay, look, I can't
lose my scholarship.
It's the only way I
can get into college.
I wish you would've
thought of that before.
You want me to what?
I don't wanna be anybody's
DUFF anymore, okay?
I wanna be my own person.
I'm tired of being the
approachable one.
I wanna be the datable one.
You're asking me for dating advice?
Today of all days?
Are you kidding me?
Look, I have a crush on this boy.
His name's Toby Tucker.
Maybe you've heard of him.
Well, I can't seem to talk to him
without making a total
ass of myself, okay?
And you never seem
to have this problem.
- Don't you hate me?
- I'm glad you asked. Yes, I do.
But only because you're a
dipshit and a man-whore.
But you're the only one
in this whole school
who told me what
was actually going on.
So you're an honest dipshit,
and that's what counts.
- Thanks?
- Can we just...?
Can we just cool it for a second?

I will make sure you pass
science if you help me with this.
I mean, you got the easy part. You
could pass science in your sleep.
I have to reverse-DUFF you.

- Definitely not.
We've got the whole place.
We are just getting started.
Step two: Time to show the world who you are.
The truth is, I don't know who
you are from your clothes, okay?
You need to start dressing more like
you, and less like Wreck-It Ralph.
- Fine.
- Dressing rooms are back there,

Get in there.

It's a little weird now.
- Whoo! Yeah. Whoo!

aren't you? Toby...
Toby, that is unbelievably
inappropriate.
But it doesn't feel bad.

Oh, God, I want you so bad. Toby...
Uh... I'm gonna change.
We should... We should go.

we should just take a break.

to get out of your boy, Tony?
- Toby.
- Tuba?
You wanna blow his horn? Put
your hand on his instrument?
- Little meow, meow, meow.
- Ugh.
Was that a little laugh? There
was a little laugh there.
- You laughed. You did laugh.
- I had a small stroke.
Yeah, like a midget jerking it.
You get it? Because
he's small?
That was...
Okay, fine.
Talking to Toby scares you, right?
The only way to get over it is
to face it right here, right now.
See Sweater Guy over there?
I want you to walk over
and get his phone number.
(LAUGHS)
- No.
- Be totally gangster about it, okay?
Just say, "I could tell from across the
room we might be into each other."
"Now that I'm here, I
know it. Your move."
- Have you met me?
- Okay.
I couldn't get through
three words of that.
All right, walk over
and say, "Hey there."
- "Hey there"?
- Hop up.
Get up.
All right, deep breath.
Shoulders back.
Lick your lips a little bit.
Ah, don't worry about the
lips. Go, strut your stuff.
- Like a peacock.
- Shh!
Hey there.
Hey there.
Is that a wiener in your mouth
or are you just happy to see me?
No, it's a bratwurst.
Oh, yeah. No. Um...
But is there a place to get a
hot dog here in this mall or...?
Yeah.

- Tss, pfft. Pfft.
- Right?
- Okay
- okay-
Bye-bye.
Did you want to go
out with me, though?
Out where?
To, uh, dates?
To a date? On a
date? To a date?
No.
No. Okay.
- Oh, you're good.
- BIANCA: Huh?
(BOTH CHUCKLE)
- You're good.
- Oh.
Where are the cameras?
- Oh, of course.
- It's a YouTube video, right?
- It's a joke.
- It's a YouTube video?
Who would wanna go
out with this guy, right?
- Oh, man, you're so good.
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.
- Totally believable.
Great. Thank you.
- How many hits did this get?
- Lot of hits.
I'm taking a lot of hits today.
All right, see you later.
- Cool.
- Okay.
- Where can I find it online?
- BIANCA: Yep, bye.
Man, so many
unanswered questions.
Really good. Thank you
so much for that, teach.
That was an awesome
lesson. I'm humiliated.

strengths and weaknesses.
- And?
- WESLEY: And...
You're horrible. I hope you like cats.

Next mission is to talk to 15 guys.
Yeah, 15 guys, without
completely falling apart, okay?
Step five: Take a few hits.
Ahem. Nope. Okay.
I can do this. How hard
could it be? Just do it.
Excuse me, I, uh...
can't do this.
Hey, I see you have a reusable bag.
You're not listening.
Hey, is this seat taken?
Oh, you're busy. I'll
come back a little later.
Oh. We have to stop

poor choices with my toppings lately.

- Nice to meet you.

that people make when
it comes to toppings?

- Granola.

- You wanna know why?
- Yeah.

that guy's number.
- Attagirl.
- I know.

the flirties rolling in.
Well, we'll see. This
is all so new for me.
Well, it seems like we're both
trying new things, then.
What I'm talking about is a good
old-fashioned crush on a boy.
- Oh.
- Yeah, his name is Toby.
Toby.
Yeah, I was kind of having
trouble getting him to notice me,
so I've brought on a sensei.
Wesley Rush.
Wesley Rush?
- From next door?
- Okay.
Honey, why don't you just
go to Jess and Casey?
You always trust their advice.
I just thought I'd branch out.
Okay.
Actually, I mean, what had
happened was, I was at...
Was this sensei thing your idea?
- Uh, yeah, but I...
- Good.
That means you're being mentally
tough and making decisions.
That's what half of my
last book was about.
When you become proactive, your
problems become subtractive,
and then good things
are bound to happen.
Wow, okay. Little of the
old proactive, subtractive.
Got it. I'll remember that if you
remember no more duck face.
- No duck head.
- Duck face.

Is this one of your lessons?
Hey, dummy humper, I found you
a new boyfriend in health class.
This is Toby too.
What do you think?
Oh, Toby.
Oh, just give it to me, Toby.
Oh, just a little pinch right
there. Just... Oh, he's dirty.
Oh, he's going to town on me, Toby.
- Oh, Toby.
- Are you gonna do anything?
MATT: You're my special little Toby.
I can take you home with me.
Boobs look good. New bra?
BIANCA: Thanks a lot.
(CROWD LAUGHING)
Oh, peaches and pears.
- Can I have peaches and pears?
- Okay.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
WESLEY: Hey, Bianca, it's Wesley.
Hey, look, I just... I
wanted to say that...
(GRUNTS)
Can I come in?
Mm-hm.
WESLEY: I deserved that.
Here.
I promise, I didn't
send the video, okay?
I overheard Madison bragging
about it to her friends.
I mean, the angles weren't
even from where I was sitting.
Why is your hand messed up?
Well, you're not the only one running
around punching people today.
No one else sees that
video. Tell everyone.
I don't know that many people.
Well, make some more
friends and tell them.
What?
Mm.
Thanks.
I've never had anybody go on a
punching spree for me before.
Well, don't get used to it.
Now there's rumors going
around I'm on 'roids.
- Aren't you? Heh.
- Well, irregardless...
- Not a word.
- Well, irregardless of that...
- A little peace offering.
- Oh, my God.
Wes, the dress?
You didn't have to do this.
I never should've called
you the DUFF, okay?
That was stupid.
- We good?
- We're good.
Thank you.
You know what's not
good is I saw Toby today.
He could barely look at me.
I think I'm just gonna, like,
write him a really long letter
just apologizing profusely
and, you know, maybe send
him an Edible Arrangement.
Stop, stop. Edible Arrangement?
Look, you don't have to
apologize for anything, okay?
- Step six...
- Let's let the steps go.
Step six: Just own
it. Grow some balls.
Tell him you know the video sucks, but
you're into him, and to deal with it.
And if he's still weird, he's a jackass.
Sometimes it's that simple.
Now, I'm off to study Hess' law
and how it relates to enthalpic
chemical change. Aww.
Who are you and what
have you done with Wes?
Or maybe I'll Google celeb
nip slips. Curtains open.
(WHISTLES)
- There he is.
- See you tomorrow.
See you.
- WOMAN: Here are your phones, kids.
- GIRL 1: Thank you.
- BOY 1: Thanks.
- BOY 2: Oh, yeah.
Thanks.
WOMAN: Everyone, get your phones.
GIRL 2: Thank you.
WOMAN: Hey, you're welcome.
Hey there.
Hey, Bianca.
Got a second to talk to a fan?
Yeah, sure, what's up?
I'm assuming you've seen the video.
- Heh. Yeah.
- Um, it's true.
I am into you.
And so I thought I should
just be straightforward
and tell you to your face.
Wow.
I'm flattered.
And impressed. Ha, ha.
Not a lot of people would
have the balls to say all that.
Well, that's my whole thing.
- Big old balls.
- Ha, ha. Right.
I think this is the first time that
you and I have ever really talked.
It's kind of nice.
Yeah, it is.
- All right, well...
- BIANCA: Okay.
- Well, yeah.
- TOBY: So, uh...
- I'll, uh, see you around.
- TOBY: Okay.
- BIANCA: All right.
- Thanks.
- See you.
- Bye. Ha, ha.
Bye. We said it at the same time.
- Bye-bye.
- TOBY: Bye.
BIANCA: Oh, shit.
We should, uh, hang out sometime.
Yeah, I'd like that.
- How's this Friday?
- This Friday, hmm,
is, uh, gonna be fine
for me. It's good.
Cool. Meet at my house?
- Seven o'clock?
- Yes, 7 is good.
- All right.
- BIANCA: See you.
- Bye. Ha-ha-ha.
- Bye.
TOBY: Bye.
- Wes.
- BOY: Hey.
- What the hell?
- You embarrassed?
- Now you know how it feels.
- Whoa, who let her in?
- Wes?
- Whoa, Bianca, what the hell is this?
Ah, kind of looks like
a penis, only smaller.
(BOYS LAUGHING)
Wes?
WESLEY: Wow, boys' locker room. Nice.
Oh, uh...
I need to talk to you
about something.
- So...
- Mm-hm. What?
- You have a question? Hmm?
- Yeah. Don't do that.
- Hmm? Question? You do.
- BIANCA: Uh... Heh.
- Stop.
- You don't.
Ha, ha. Come on,
please. It's important.
- What do you want?
- BIANCA: Let's go.
- Okay.
- Ugh.
- So you asked him out?
- BIANCA: Yeah.
- That's awesome.
- Yeah.
What's the problem?
If you must know, I've never
been on an actual date before.
Okay, okay. Sit down, sit down.
We got this. Come here. All right.
Step seven: The date.
Okay, we need a plan.
You think a football team runs
on the field without a strategy?
Eh... Mm.
- Exactly, no. Of course they don't.
- No, of course they don't.
You want this date to end with you
making out, you need to think ahead.
So give me the vibe of the
restaurant you're going for.
Okay, I'm thinking
something kind of trendy,
you know, kind of
hipster, maybe unique?
- Done. Dave & Buster's.
- Huh?
- The place with the metal claw game?
- You bet your ass.
WESLEY: <i>Okay, you, Toby. Let's get started.</i>
<i>Worst scenario is if you get seated at
a table right across from each other.</i>
<i>Okay, no one's making out if they're
three feet apart. Simple geology.</i>
You need a booth, okay?
It's better for flirting,
not-so-accidental touching,
making out. Game on.
Wow, I had no idea guys like you
even thought about this kind of stuff.
Well, that's because you're racist
against jocks. You're a jock-cist.
Okay, moving on.
Okay, so how do you
set the tone at dinner?
<i>Lighting matters, okay? The
darker the booth, the better.</i>
Lighting, dark booth.
Got it. What's next?
Body language.
<i>Is he leaning in?</i>
- <i> Is he sitting close?</i>
- I <i>don't know...</i>
WESLEY: <i>And then it's all about interaction.</i>
<i>Is he trying to impress you?</i>
<i>Does he say complimentary
things to you</i>?
<i>If yes, chances are he's
gonna make his move.</i>
<i>And touchdown.</i>
Wes.
I always wanted to do
that to the coach's board.
It's big because it's on a chalkboard.
We gotta go. Come
on. Let's go, let's go.
Hey, DUFF queen, wanna show
me some of them moves?
Shh.
- ARTHUR: Bianca?
- BIANCA: Yes.
The video was hysterical. Eat a dick.
Thanks. I just had a
bagel, though, so I'm full.
Mr. Arthur, I'm really sorry. I...
ARTHUR: No, don't worry
about it. Step into my hallway.
I don't play favorites,
but you're my favorite.
You ever heard the phrase "The
pen is mightier than the sword"?
Yeah, and in this case,
a bunch of kids anonymously typing
whatever comments they want
feels like an atomic bomb,
and that's definitely
mightier than a sword.
So make your writing
have a positive effect.
As in a certain homecoming
article that's due.
Oh, please, Mr. Arthur,
the last thing I wanna
do is go to a place
where everybody hates me
and then write about it.
I picked you for a reason.
And whatever you write, I'm running
it as our lead, so make it count.
Inspire us. Remember, the pen
is mightier than the sword.
(STUDENTS SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)
Simon, get your finger out of there.
SIMON: You're not my father.
ARTHUR: Yes, I am your daddy, Simon.
MAN: What do you want me
to say? I have nothing to say.
WOMAN: I do everything around
this house, and you don't do...
- MAN: Oh, here we go.
- WOMAN: Well, it's the truth.
MAN: Wesley, will you get the door?!
WOMAN: Oh, don't yell at him.
He has nothing to do with this.
MAN: Save it for therapy, okay, honey?
- Wesley, get the door!
- WESLEY: Okay, enough, I got it.
Hey, ready to go get down
- with some bro-valent electrons?
- Yeah.
- Do you wanna talk about it?
- I'd like to not talk.
Hmm. Well, I know just the place.
WESLEY: You see why I
need that scholarship?
WESLEY: Hey, B, where the hell are we going?
My special place. You'll see.
- Is this where you kill me?
- Ha, ha. Yes.
They're never gonna
find you out here.
Aha.
I give you Think Rock.
- Huh?
- Wow. Um...
What happens here?
Well, it's gonna blow your
mind, but sit on the rock.
- Unh.
- Good, good.
And then you think.
Try it.
How'd you find this place?
I used to run up here
a lot with Pepper,
and she would always make
a direct beeline to this rock.
I remember Pepper.
How's she doing?
I guess she's okay.
When my parents got divorced,
my mom wanted custody of me,
and my dad wanted
custody of the dog.
- Wow.
- Yeah, so I think that
pretty much sums it up right there.
Are your...?
- Are your parents gonna get divorced?
- God, I hope so.
I just... I...
It's okay.
It's not okay.
But it will be.
I promise.
I'm... I'm sorry, I didn't...
Oh. No, I... It's okay, I...
- What, um...? Were you...?
- That... You know what?
That was... Uh, that was practice.
Sorry, practice for...?
For step eight, okay,
for... Of the plan.
That was practice in case you hadn't
made out with anyone in a while.
Huh.
It's all part of the plan?
It's just practice, just a
guerrilla-style practice session?
- Sneak attack.
- Hm, hm.
Really?
Mm-hm, okay.
Is that what it felt like?
That I hadn't made out with
anyone in a while or whatever?
Well, I mean, I'm more of
a tongue guy myself, but...
You don't say? I think I felt
it poking out my butthole.
- Ha-ha-ha.
- So far down my throat. Ha, ha.
Are you giving me kissing advice?
Man, I guess I am.
- B.
- You need it.
That's how people kiss.
Uh, in porn, maybe.
What's wrong with porn?
If this was a porn movie,
we wouldn't be sitting on a
rock having a conversation.
You know, you'd be
bringing me a pizza
or, um, you know, cleaning my pool.
How old is the porn
you're watching?
That doesn't... That's not...
That's not even a thing anymore.
- They don't do that?
- Ha, ha.
All right, you know what?
I'm gonna give you a lesson.
It's gonna be free. The
first one's always free.
All right, this is how
girls like to be kissed.
- We're doing this?
- We're doing this.
- Close your eyes. Ha, ha.
- Heh.
- Ready.
- Okay, okay. Lean in.
Hey-oh. Go slow, okay?
Let the tension build.
So much to learn.
- Okay, ready?
- No.
(LAUGHS)
Okay, now lean in.
Slow.
Oh, no.
That was a good one.
- You are a phenomenal kisser.
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Thank you. That's how we like it.
- What is that?
Are you feeling a little better?
- Hmm?
- Yeah, okay, a little bit.
You're welcome.
Come on, let's go.
We have a date with
the periodic chart.
The only periodic chart I
know is the one that tells me
what time of the month
to avoid Madison. Hey!
- I'm not gonna high-five you on that.
- WESLEY: Come on, science jokes.
BIANCA: <i>Know how they
say "The hills have eyes"</i>?
<i>Well, it turns out the
shrubs have bitches</i>
- <i>who videotape everything.</i>
- WESLEY: Oh, here we go.
BIANCA: Well, you don't.
WESLEY: Ever been kicked in the nuts?
BIANCA: Oh, God, you
always come back with that.
- Hey, B.
- Madison, how are you?
Do you wanna see something
hysterical? Hold on.
Watch this.
(MUSIC PLAYING ON PHONE)
MADISON: Did you see the
way that guy looked at you?
- This part's the best.
- MAN: <i>Definitely not.</i>
MADISON: Wait, just look at your face. Ha, ha.
Oh, don't worry, um,
it's a working title.
You know, I was thinking maybe
"retail slut" or just "slut whore."
You thought the first video was bad.
Boy, this one's gonna destroy you.
What do you want from me?
Oh, I think it's adorable that Wesley
indulged you in a pity make-out.
Oh, no, no.
I don't even know how you...
But it... That wasn't
what it looked like.
Yeah, no shit, it's not.
Because Wesley and I are
getting back together.
- Hmm. Is Wesley aware of this?
- He will be made aware.
- Look, Bianca, I've tried to be nice.
- BIANCA: Have you?
Shh. So let me put
this a little differently.
I don't like people thinking
of my ex-boyfriend
hitting it with someone like you.
The thing you have to understand
is what happens in high school
is gonna stay with us forever.
Most people don't think that, but
then again, most people are losers.
- Mm. Fascinating.
- People like me matter here.
People like you will never matter.
So stop messing it up
for those of us who do.
See you in math.
BIANCA: <i>In the past, her threat alone</i>
<i>would've been enough to
make me hide under my bed.</i>
<i>But I wasn't even trying to
hook up with Wesley Rus</i>h.
<i>I couldn't even imagine it.</i>
<i>I'm horny for sex.</i>
- Oh!
- Oh, hey.
Someone's pool need cleaning?
Also I brought pizza.
And I like to have sex with girls.
I'm a girl.
- WESLEY: Ow.
- Hmm.
BIANCA: <i>Okay, maybe I could imagine it,</i>
<i>but I had to stay focused
on my Toby mission.</i>
<i>Date night. I worked
up all my courage</i>
<i>and tried on the dress
Wesley gave me.</i>
<i>In my head, I think I was expecting
some big reality-show reveal.</i>
All right.
BIANCA: <i>But it was just me.</i>
<i>Me in a dress.</i>
BIANCA: Ma, I'm off to my big night.
Whoa, look at you.
Wow, look at you.
Look at you not in a pantsuit.
I know. I have my first Internet date.
We both like Thai food, are
athletically toned and lying about it.
Oh, my God.
- That dress is beautiful on you.
- Thanks.
- Wes gave it to me.
- Oh, what are you two doing tonight?
Oh, no, heh, not... I'm
not going out with Wes.
I'm going out with Toby.
Toby's the guy that I like.
Right, well, that should be fun.
Yeah. I actually kind of
feel nervous about it
just because I feel like I
might say something stupid,
- and I don't really know when...
- Honey, stop.
Believe, retrieve, achieve.
It is a mantra that I
teach all of my clients
who suffer from
performance anxiety.
Believe it happened yesterday.
Retrieve your confidence.
Achieve your goals.
- Just don't conceive.
- Mm.
Okay. Well, I'm off to do some
believing and hopefully achieving.
- Love you, have fun.
- Unless there was something else.
Nope, I'm good. See you, have fun.
Hey, look at you.
Studying almost like
you were a real student.
Actually, I'm just waiting
for strangers to walk by
so I can show them this bad boy.
Hey-oh!
Oh, you're not the only B in
my life. Suck it, science.
That is actually incredible.
I can't believe it. Congratulations.
Coach says I might get to
play some football this year.
What?
- I'm so proud of you. Good job.
- Ah.
(BIANCA CHUCKLES)
Wow.
- Ah, my dress.
- Ah? Not bad for a DUFF, am I right?
It's my big Toby date night.
Off to a nice evening
of talking about the finer things
in life with a fellow intellectual?
Yes, please. Ha, ha.
So, I mean, how do I look? Is
this good, coach? Come on.
You look good.
Good? Wow, that's
really a rave review.
I just mean that you look good,
but you don't look like you.
What? What are
you talking about?
- What do you mean? No, tell me.
- Nothing, nothing. You look fantastic.
I got my grades up, you got
your date. We're good.
- Are you sure? You're being weird.
- You're being weird, okay?
- Go.
- Okay, I'll tell you how it goes.
- All right.
- Okay, bye.
Bye.
Wish me luck.
Good luck.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Come on in.
- Wow, you really dressed up.
- Oh?
This old
thing? Ha, ha.
Um, so hey, where
do you wanna go?
Because I actually heard
that Dave & Buster's
is, like, the cool, hip new spot.
The place with the
metal claw game?
- Yeah, that's the one. Fun, right?
- Yeah. Ha, ha.
Well, I do love Dave & Buster's,
but I actually took the liberty of
making a reservation already.
Hope this is okay. Thought
we could eat here tonight.
I've been teaching myself
how to make sushi online.
I just thought it would be,
you know, more personal.
Yeah, I like that.
(TIMER DINGS)
Oh, uh, those are
the baked crab rolls.
Make yourself at home. That's
Japanese tea, by the way.
- So enjoy.
- Okay.
BIANCA: <i>Nightmare. I'd only
been trained for Dave & Buster's</i>.
<i>What did Wes say? That "no one's
making out if they're three feet apart."</i>
Okay.
Oh, Jesus.
Hey. Oh. Uh...
- Everything okay?
- Oh, yeah. No, uh, I was getting...
I was feeling, like, a draft
over when I was here,
so I just kind of scooted
it on over here.
- I can turn off the air.
- Oh, okay. Whatever.
That's probably a good idea.
BIANCA: <i>The vibe. Darker the better.</i>
Okay.
Really? What
kind of light...?
- What?
- Hey, Bianca. That's better...
- Oh. Did we blow a fuse?
- I guess we did.
I was just over here looking
at this picture of you
in the tiny sweatpants,
and it got dark.
I don't know. It's crazy.
I'll just flip the breakers,
turn all the lights on.
Oh, you're gonna turn all the...?
Turn them all back on? Okay.
- What?
- Oh! Hey, let there be light, right?
Yeah. From the Bible.
Cool. That's crazy.
- What's the crab doing right now?
- Oh, I'll go get him.
Okay, great.
I can't believe you
made all this sushi.
This is like restaurant-quality sushi.
Like, look at this. Do you
have a special tool for these?
Ha, ha. It took a few hours.
If it has to do with my hands, I
usually pick it up really quickly.
That's actually how I got into guitar.
- Oh, yeah. Tell me more about that.
- I was a terrible student.
(TOBY LAUGHS)
And so my mom used to
stand outside my room
to make sure that I was
doing my homework.
Game on.
- What?
- I said, go on with the story,
because I'm loving it.
So then I just started writing poems,
and those poems became songs and...
That is so cool.
I want you to take me...
Take me on this table right now.
(BOTH MOANING)
What's up? Oh,
California roll?
- Mm. Oof!
- Ew!
TOBY: Are you okay?
Ah.
Ah, yeah, I'm just really
feeling this sushi.
It's really... It's doing
something to me.
Ha, ha. Yeah. Well, thanks.
No, like I said, it's the poetry
of the chord progression
intertwining with the
poetry of the lyrics.
It's like two people in love.
Yeah, like a midget jerking it.
Meow, meow, meow-meow.
(LAUGHS)
Yeah, funny. Actually, that
kind of reminds me of a song
that I wrote a few weeks ago.
I could play it for you later if you like.
- Yeah, totally.
- Yeah, totally.
You know, I've been
working on a poem myself.
<i>There once a boy named Toby Tucker
Bianca Piper just wished he would...</i>
Okay, I think I'm gonna
use the bathroom.
Where is it?
What are you doing to me out there?
What...? You're not
into Wesley, are you?
You bet your ass, you are. Whoo!
Who's number one in your brain?
- No. Get out.
- This guy. This guy is.
- Yeah.
- Get out.
Okay, you've gotta
pull it together, okay?
Toby Tucker is gonna play you a
song, and you're gonna love it.
Here we go.
(STRUMMING GUITAR)
Are you okay?
Little cold?
I'm a little chilly, yeah.
Oh, hang on.
There you go. Better?
Yeah, definitely. Thanks.
So here's the song.
- Be gentle. I'm still working on it, so...
- Okay.
(SINGING) B<i>aby, you
set my soul on fire.</i>
<i>And, girl, you are my heart's desire.</i>
<i>Don't you know it's true.</i>
<i>In everything we do.</i>
<i>I just want it to be.</i>
<i>The two of us</i>
I don't know exactly
how to rhyme that.
- Oh, no. It's so good, though.
- Thank you. I think it's great.
I mean, I've been working
on it for a little bit, so...
But enough about me.
I mean, how have you been,
after that video came out?
It's been a little tough.
A lot of people... A lot of people
saw it. Heh. I don't know.
To be honest, the saddest
part about it is that
I kind of got into a fight
with my best friends, and...
Jess and Casey?
Uh, yes, Jess and Casey.
And, um, I don't know, it's,
like, my fault pretty much.
I kind of wanna reach out,
but I'm not really sure
- what I should do about it, and...
- You should talk to them.
I mean, they seem like really
caring, understanding people, so...
Mm. Mm-hm.
Sorry, are you friends with them?
Yeah, Jess is in my drama class
and I have trig with Casey.
Oh, yeah. You know...
I mean, Jess is, like,
an amazing actress.
- Mm.
- And dancer.
Mm.
- And dresser.
- Okay.
And Casey, she's, like, this,
you know, fiery Latina.
You know, <i>caliente,</i> you know.
Yeah, she's very spicy.
But, you know, I'm not really
friends with them right now, so...
Is it intimidating?
What?
Being friends with... And it's
rare that I point this out,
because I do not subscribe to the
American ideal of feminine beauty.
But such powerful women?
BIANCA: <i>Oh, no. No, no, no.</i>
A friend of mine was wondering,
do they have dates to the
homecoming dance next weekend?
BIANCA: <i>I tried to keep my composure, but...</i>
(SCREAMS THEN SOBS)
(RETCHES)
Are you DUFFing me?
Excuse me?
You are.
This is a DUFF.
You're using me to try to get
closer to Jess and Casey,
because you think that I'm
approachable, aren't you?
Okay, look, when you said that
we should hang out Friday,
I thought you were hinting
that they were gonna be here.
Like, I thought you were
saying that they were into me.
I can't... I can't even believe this.
I can't believe for five
seconds I thought that...
- Bianca, Bianca.
- What?
Can I have my sweatshirt?
Heh, okay, you know what?
Here, you can have it.
Oh.
Oh, hell, no.
Mr. Sushi?
- The song was mine.
- Yeah.
I'm not surprised, because
it was a piece of shit.
And so are you. Have a nice night.
(LINE RINGS)
- WESLEY OVER PHONE: <i>Hello?</i>
- Wes, it's Bianca.
<i>Just kidding. It's my voice mail.</i>
(LINE BEEPS)
Wes, it's Bianca.
So it turns out that Toby's been
DUFFing me the whole time.
And I've just been thinking
about some stuff, and I just...
I'd really like to talk to
you, okay? Call me back.
(MADISON LAUGHING)
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Hey, I got your message.
Yeah, um, forget about
it. Just go home.
Look, I'm sorry about Toby.
Okay? He's
an idiot.
You know, I saw you and Madison.
- Okay.
- You were at my special place.
You know, that's my Think Rock.
You said I could use it.
Not as a Motel 6, Wes.
You were on a date with Toby.
Are you seriously mad
at me right now?
I thought we were friends.
Come on, we're not friends.
You know, people like
you don't hang out
with people like me, you know?
That's just the way it is. Football
guys, they date hot chicks.
And people like me
don't date anybody.
I don't know why I thought
it could be different.
What are you talking
about? B, this isn't you.
Please, Wes, you're embarrassed
to be seen with me at school.
Okay?
It's just...
This was an experiment,
and it worked for you
and it didn't work for me,
so let's just forget it, okay?
- B...
- Please, just go home.
BIANCA: <i>So, what does
homecoming mean to me</i>?
<i>The word "homecoming" itself</i>
<i>conjures up feelings of
warmth and comfort.</i>
<i>High school offers me none of that.</i>
<i>I know some people will tell you that
homecoming is about celebrating,</i>
<i>but to the majority of kids in school,</i>
<i>it's just another night
where you feel pressure</i>
<i>to find the perfect
date, the perfect outfit</i>,
<i>and have the perfect evening.</i>
<i>Come Monday morning,
it's back to reality.</i>
<i>I don't know about you,</i>
<i>but I'm happy to sit this one out.</i>
<i>I didn't regret hitting "send,"</i>
<i>but I did regret how I left
things with Jess and Casey</i>.
CASEY: So all of this because of some word?
It didn't feel like just
some word to me.
I think deep down I've always known
you guys were prettier than me,
and I felt like I couldn't
talk to you about it,
because you wouldn't understand what
it felt like to be your schlumpy friend.
But, you know, you're wrong,
because we all have our insecurities.
The point is, we're a team.
If anything, we're kind of
chumps in comparison to you.
Okay, now you went too far. You
had me and then you lost me.
Oh, no, she's right, B. You
are by far the smartest one
of the three of us. You're
loyal, you're funny.
And we can't be Bianca, Jess
and Casey without Bianca.
Thanks.
Oh.
Okay, you know what?
Tonight how about we ditch our
dates and have a girls' night?
- Done.
- BIANCA: What? No, no way.
Guys, it's homecoming.
You're definitely going.
I just... I can't see Wes.
Or Toby. Or anyone, for that matter.
Just let me stay here and lie
amongst the pizza a little longer.
- Absolutely not.
- BIANCA: Mom.
- You're listening at the door again?
- Yes, I was. This is juicy stuff.
Now it all makes sense.
Mom, I've been through
all of your stages, okay?
I am already at the fifth
and final stage: Acceptance.
Honey, forget about the five stages.
I have got some real advice for you.
We're gonna call it, uh, stage 11.
Yeah, it's sort of acceptance plus,
where you realize who
you are, you accept it,
and then you, um,
(IN BRITISH ACCENT)
turn it up to 11.
Is that supposed to
be Robert Pattinson?
(IN NORMAL VOICE)
No, Spinal Tap.
The movie, <i>Spinal Tap.</i>
(IN BRITISH ACCENT)
"This one goes to 11."
Let's stop.
(IN NORMAL VOICE) All
right, honey, you're a weirdo.
Fine, own it. Be the
best weirdo you can be.
You have spent the last
month worrying so much
about what other
people think about you.
How about tonight you just worry
about what you think about you?
Now, I want you to get cleaned up,
I want you to go to that dance,
and rock that homecoming
like my Bianca Piper would.
Passion plus action...
- Oh, my God, I'm doing it again.
- No, no, it's okay, it's working.
You're good at this. I'm
feeling mad inspired.
I think I have an idea.
(INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE)
Hmm.
There it is. I gotta say, this
is some of my best work.
- You are very talented.
- It's really perfect, Jess.
All right, I just talked with the guys,
and I told them we're going alone.
- Ooh. Yes.
- Thanks.
So shall we?
(CLAPS)
Let's do this shit.
Fucking A.
- Mom.
- Sorry.
(ICONA POP'S "ALL NIGHT" PLAYING)
She looks great. She's pulling it off.
- Dude, she's 15 years old, man.
- She's a ten.
I don't care about 15. She's a ten.
And then she was all like, "Bitch,
if I wanted your opinion, I'd ask."
And I was all like, "Bitch, if I
cared what you thought, I'd ask."
Ugh, my grandma is so annoying.
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Wesley, what time is it?
Nine-fifteen.
Okay, they're announcing
king and queen soon,
so, Caitlyn, I wanna go over by the
stage and get the very best lighting.
I'll be right back.
Wow.
Um, you guys, I'll
be right back, okay?
- ROBIN: Awesome dress, Bianca.
- Thanks, Robin.
- Hey, Bianca, about the other...
- Shh, shh, shh.
Uh...
- BIANCA: Hey.
- Hey.
I could tell from across the room
that we might be into each other.
Now that I'm here,
I'm sure. Your move.
- WESLEY: Wow.
- How was that?
That was not bad.
Should I've gone with
"wiener in your mouth"?
- No, no. Definitely not.
- Ha, ha.
- Um...
- Wow, um...
You look beautiful.
Thanks.
Look, um, about what
I said the other day,
of course we're friends,
and that's cool.
But a guy I know once told
me that if you like somebody,
you should just be
straight-up with them
and tell them that you're into them.
So I guess that's kind
of what I'm doing.
Wait, you're into me?
Yeah.
Um...
I, uh... I kind of just got
back together with Madison.
Oh.
But that's good if you're happy.
- What the shit?
- Ow.
MADISON: Get out of my way.
Wow, that is an interesting dress.
Who makes that, Build-A-Bear?
Since you can't seem to
leave my boyfriend alone,
I cannot wait to release
your video tomorrow.
Good. I'm glad you're excited
about it. Go right ahead.
Fine, I Will.
Plus, Wesley would never leave
me for some DUFF anyway.
- Look, Madison...
- BIANCA: It's okay.
Ooh. Madison, you used
to make me so upset,
but now I just feel bad for you.
Yeah, I'm somebody's DUFF.
Guess what, so are
you. So is everybody.
There's always gonna be somebody
prettier or more talented
or richer than you,
but it shouldn't affect
how you see yourself.
You label everybody to
try to keep them down,
but you end up missing out on
all this great stuff around you.
You have Wesley, and you treat
him like he's stupid, but he isn't.
And people don't like him,
because he's with you.
They like him because
he's, like, an amazing guy.
Look, I like myself.
I wouldn't wanna be anybody else.
And I realize now that
none of this matters to me.
But it does to you. It's your dream.
And I totally support that.
Just don't tear me down for not
giving a shit about your labels,
because in the end,
they're meaningless.
MADISON: What?
Whatever you said was
meaningless, okay?
You don't even get it.
This is not my dream.
- I don't need to...
- BUCHANON: Okay, Blue Devils.
Oh, my God, here it is.
It's happening.
Okay, Blue Devils, it's time to
crown our king and queen.
(CROWD APPLAUDING)
Hey, how'd it go?
- Actually, really good.
- This year's homecoming queen is...
This one's got me a little nervous.
Ms. Madison Morgan.
(CROWD APPLAUDING)
Me? What?
Oh, my God, of course.
GIRL: Madison!
- Congratulations, Madison.
- I knew it was me.
Keep it to yourself.
- BOY: Yeah, Madison.
- All right.
And this year's homecoming king is...
Drumroll, please.
Mr. Wesley Rush.
(CROWD APPLAUDING AND CHEERING)
Wesley Rush.
Homecoming king. Come on up.
Wesley. Wesley.
Wesley.
BUCHANON: Where's Wesley?
Aren't you gonna go get your crown?
No, I'm gonna get the girl.
- BOY: Yeah, Bianca!
- Let's get the hell out of here.
GIRL: All right. All right.
Yeah, all right.
Damn.
It was definitely the dress.
- That is really great.
- Yeah, he is hot.
Are we breaking into the
newsroom to hook up?
- BIANCA: You bet we are.
- Who are you?
(BIANCA CHUCKLES)
- Wesley?
- What?
I just want to... I just want
to... One more thing.
- What? What?
- Just one thing.
No, they block out all the good sites.
- What are you doing?
- I just have to...
WESLEY: No, no, if you're doing
homework, I'm gonna kill myself.
It's just one quick thing.
It's for my article.
I'm feeling inspired.
- Okay, here, just rub my shoulders.
- Right.
BIANCA: <i>What does homecoming mean to me?</i>
<i>If you asked me at the
beginning of senior year,</i>
<i>I would've told you,
"Absolutely nothing."</i>
<i>But tonight, possibly the
greatest night of my life,</i>
<i>I have changed my tune.</i>
<i>You know that one moment in high
school that changes everything?</i>
Okay, I think I can
probably finish this later.
BIANCA: <i>It all started senior year,
about a month before homecoming.</i>
<i>I was cruising the halls
with my two best friends...</i>
BOY: Wow, she's awesome.
Yeah, she is. I should forward this.
- Viral?
- Viral.
I'm a DUFF.
I am a DUFF.
Yep, that's me.
- I'm a DUFF.
- I'm a DUFF.
Okay, girl, I know some DUFFs too.
ARTHUR: Wow.
For what it's worth,
what you wrote here
struck a chord with me as well.
I mean, I know you won't believe me,
but I was the DUFF out of my friends.
What? No.
There was no cool name
for it like "the DUFF."
It was, like, "the dipshit,"
uh, douche bag.
A. Urkel. Asian Urkel.
- Nerd ass.
- Okay, no. Didn't need...
- Didn't need the help, you know?
- Oh, sorry.
(COMPUTER BEEPING)
BIANCA: Whoa, look at this.
The site has thousands of
comments and likes on it.
But they're positive this time.
BIANCA: <i>Mr. Arthur was right.</i>
<i>Kids started writing to me
with their own DUFF stories,</i>
<i>and when I posted those,</i>
<i>more kids responded until it
just became its own thing.</i>
<i>Oh, and Wesley?
He passed science.</i>
<i>He's going to Ohio State in the fall.</i>
<i>And since I got into Northwestern,
we can visit each other.</i>
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)
BIANCA: <i>A lot.</i>
Hey, neighbor-slash-boyfriend.
Hi, neighbor-slash-girlfriend.
You hungry?
I'm hungry.
- Yeah, I could eat.
- Good.
Because I was hoping
to take you to dinner.
Ooh. How about a
little Dave & Buster's?
- Skee-Ball?
- Ah!
- A dark booth? Yeah.
- Ah! I love it when you talk dirty to me.
- Maybe we'll accidentally touch knees.
- Oh, can I?
(IN MONSTER VOICE)
Bianca kiss Wes now?
WESLEY: Oh, monster voice sexy.
(BOTH LAUGH)
BIANCA: <i>In the end, it's not about
popularity or even getting the guy.</i>
<i>It's about understanding</i>
<i>that no matter what label
is thrown your way,</i>
<i>only you can define yourself.</i>
<i>Take it from a DUFF.</i>
(CREW LAUGHING)
Hit that... Hit that, uh...
That long one in the middle.
It's called a spacebar.
- <i> Hey.
- Now, that's a classic look.</i>
<i>You could be on the cover
of GQ. Back cove</i>r.
<i>Just a vest. Okay, MacGyver.</i>
<i>You talk about my son
one more ******* time.</i>
(SPEAKING IN SPANISH)
Bluh!
I swear, I'm just
feeling the pressure.
If this makes it to Toshi,
- I'm telling you now...
- Toshi.
- Now I know you...
- Ha, ha.
- Now I know that you...
- Ha, ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.
- (IN JAPANESE ACCENT) </i>This is not...</i>
- This is a...
- Hmm. Not the article I want.
- Dad, 17 pa...
- But it article we need.
(BOTH LAUGHING)
- <i> Hey, Trevor.
- Have fun tonight, Trevor.</i>
- <i> I hate you.
- No, you look adorable.</i>
<i>Mm. Ish.</i>
<i>I'm not happy!</i>
I haven't been kissed in years.
- MAN: Can we do one more...?
- Okay, not again.
(CREW LAUGHING)
Oh, are we making a movie?
