Some of this is legend,
but at least
this much is fact.
When rioting citizens
of France destroyed the Bastille,
they discovered
within its records this mysterious entry:
Come on. There.
Are you dead yet?
Thank you.
Aramis!
Aramis!
Porthos is...
Oh,
I'm sorry, my dears.
You would have
enjoyed it too.
He's hung like a donkey.
So are you.
- Really?
- Yeah.
He's been asleep so long,
I've forgotten about him.
Okay, go on now. Go on.
Yes, leave his
holiness alone.
I'll bring you back tomorrow
when he's in a better mood.
Go on.
Go on, ladies. Go.
Stop praying
and revel with me, Aramis!
I need my spirits lifted!
I'm old! I'm weak!
My strength is gone!
Porthos.
I'm praying.
I just said
you're praying.
Are you deaf too?
I know you're blind.
If you'd seen the tits
that just walked out,
you'd have tears
in your eyes.
Sometimes there are more important
things to life than a good pair of tits.
Really?
Aramis... If you can
name me one thing,
one single thing
that is more sublime...
Than the feel of a plump,
pink nipple between my lips...
I'll build you
a new cathedral.
Forgiveness.
Forgiveness?
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Am I forgiven?
Am I forgiven?
I observe your forgiveness isn't
sweeter than a plump nipple.
Don't you understand?
I'm trying to pray!
You're always praying!
D'Artagnan!
Huh?
Oh! D'Artagnan!
How are you,
young pup?
Porthos.
You interrupted a simple
theological discussion.
So I see.
Welcome. Sit.
I wish that I could, Aramis, but I come
upon the King's business.
He wishes to see you.
Still you serve him loyally,
even though the people
throw rotten eggs at his royal emblem.
D'Artagnan,
look at you.
You look so young...
And I feel so old.
The King says immediately.
One for all, D'Artagnan.
And all for one.
We were all
musketeers once, eh?
I wonder how
Athos is doing.
Relax, Raoul.
After all, you're my son.
How could any woman
resist you?
When will you ask her?
Today... As we arrive.
Or, perhaps,
when we are leaving.
When I think of it,
I get so confused.
Will this help?
Mother's ring.
No, I can't take this. It's yours.
She died
giving you to me.
I want to die knowing it's on the
finger of the woman my son loves.
Go. Bring back
your fiancée.
Your Majesty, the attack
will come at dawn.
No, no. Do not
underestimate the Dutch.
These troops will be cut off
here, so shift them here and here.
And then we outnumber them
there. Yes, send that on its way.
Your Majesty.
The yellow sash.
As your advisors,
we feel it is our...
- Our duty.
- Yes.
Yes, our duty
to inform you that there are riots in Paris.
Riots?
But Paris is the most
beautiful city in the world.
Why should my people feel anything but...
Pride and contentment?
Of course, Your Majesty.
I'm sure they are content and proud.
But they are
also starving.
Your Majesty,
if we distributed some of the food...
Reserved for the Army...
The priest, Aramis.
There would be time
to gather more...
Father Aramis, His Majesty
is experiencing difficulty with the Jesuits.
The Jesuits?
They have declared
His Majesty's wars unjust...
And the source
of public hunger.
Perhaps His Majesty
should speak to their leader.
Yes, but who is he? No one can keep
secrets like the Jesuits can.
Ah, Aramis.
Your Majesty.
You are a priest,
but once you were a musketeer.
I, like my father
before me,
have trusted you
with the gravest of missions.
So...
I want you to find out
who the secret leader of the Jesuits is.
And when you have,
for God and for France,
I wish you to kill him.
I know this is a terrible
thing I ask, especially from a priest, but...
Can you accept
this mission...
And keep it private?
When I discover the identity
of this Jesuit rebel,
I will kill both him
and the man who told me.
Once a musketeer,
always a musketeer, huh?
Now, about these riots.
We have stocks
on the wharves right now, don't we?
We can distribute that.
But, Majesty,
that food is spoiling.
That is why it was not
sent to the Army.
Then you must hurry.
What an excellent idea,
Your Majesty.
Look at the stitching
on that one.
Don't they
look glorious?
Not so glorious
as you.
Who is that?
Raoul,
the son ofAthos.
François,
your taste may run to young soldiers,
but I was referring
to the beauty next to him.
Her name
is Christine.
Your Majesty.
What is it now, D'Artagnan?
Assassins falling from the skies?
The plans for the pig chase
were not revealed to me.
D'Artagnan...
Look at the faces
of these men.
How they admire
and fear you.
With the great D'Artagnan
watching over me,
who in France would be possibly such a
fool as to try and do me harm?
A fool's blade can be
sharper than his brain.
Let us play a game.
Let us pretend
as if I am king...
And you are the captain
of my musketeers.
Let us behave
as if my wish is law.
And my wish, D'Artagnan,
is to enjoy this party.
As should you.
Ladies.
Christine,
ever since I arrived...
Monsieur?
Mademoiselle?
No, thank you.
Christine...
Raoul.
D'Artagnan.
Captain, may I present
Christine Bellefort?
Enchanté.
D'Artagnan
is my father's best friend.
I am honored you've granted my request
for a commission in the musketeers,
that I may follow
my father and you.
The honor is mine, Raoul.
One for all.
And all for one.
Christine...
I love you.
And I love you, Raoul.
I'll never be a rich man,
but you'll always
have my heart.
Then I am richer
than the king.
Then I have something to give you that
once belonged to my mother.
We offer a contest
of cunning and agility.
Behold our unicorn!
Whoever captures
our unicorn,
shall win its treasure.
Now... To the chase.
I command you all!
The pendant will be yours.
I've got it!
Christine, isn't it?
I would have thought it was impossible,
but I do believe the excitement of this
chase has made you more beautiful.
Sire, I...
Thank you. I'm...
You blush. You do not wish to
look beautiful for your king?
No, Sire.
I mean, yes, yes,
of course, Sire.
I mean that you are...
It's all right.
I understand that you're not
accustomed to these surroundings,
but that is a condition
we can happily remedy.
One such as you would fit
nicely as a lady-in-waiting.
His Majesty
is very, very kind,
but I'm engaged to Raoul.
Or will be when
he manages to ask me.
You would choose a soldier
who has not yet proposed...
Above a king?
I could only
be faithful to my heart.
But how faithful
is that heart to you?
Wait, Christine.
- Christine.
- Raoul.
Feed your people.
Jesuits.
Get me a general.
Her Majesty wishes
a word with you.
Your Majesty.
I understand you saved
my son's life today.
God smiled upon us,
Your Majesty.
And you are not hurt?
No, My Lady.
That is good.
Captain...
Raoul, son ofAthos, has withdrawn his
request to join the musketeers.
D'Artagnan!
You have improved.
It's been so long.
So it has, my friend.
What's the occasion?
As you say,
it's been too long.
When the great D'Artagnan
visits, he must be offered the best wine.
And if the great
Athos offers,
then the great D'Artagnan
must drink.
I'm sorry I haven't been
to see you lately, my friend.
Head of the King's
bodyguards.
That must
keep you busy.
Especially with this king.
Still, I should have come
to see you more often.
I belong to the past, when the uniforms
were black and grown men wore them.
At least it gives you
more time to practice your violin.
And feel sorry
for myself.
My son is grown.
He's proposed to a wonderful girl.
He's joined the musketeers. All the errors
of my life are made right in him.
And now, for the life I've always wished
him, he's leaving my home.
Athos...
Out celebrating all night.
Raoul, look who's
come to visit.
What's the matter?
I cannot risk making her a widowjust
as I was to make her a wife.
I've been recalled
to my regiment.
But that makes no sense.
You've already served
at the front.
Has there been
some disaster?
Has everyone else
been recalled?
I believe the King's eye
has fallen on Christine.
The King has noticed her, but I don't
think it has anything to do with Raoul.
It has everything
to do with it. The King is a dog!
Athos.
A dog and a coward.
But I am neither,
and so I go.
Raoul...
D'Artagnan, does the King
have trouble finding women?
Does he have trouble
filling his bed?
I served his father.
Until I retired,
I served him.
And now, to seduce a woman who will
mean nothing to him once he has had her,
he would put
my son's life in danger?
You knew
this was happening.
That's why you came.
I knew your temper.
You came to restrain me?
I came to bring you hope.
I will speak
to the King personally.
I have not yet lost faith that he may
become the king we all wish him to be.
You don't know what
it's like to have a son,
to have kissed his hair
and smelled his breath as he slept,
to have watched him grow.
Yes, fatherhood
is a blessing.
I can only imagine.
D'Artagnan, I have never known a finer
man than you nor cared more for a friend.
But if this king harms my son
merely to take a lover,
then this king
will become my enemy.
And so will any man
that stands between that enemy and me.
Then I must hurry...
For I treasure
your son...
As I treasure you.
Guard the gate.
Captain, the people are saying the food the
King ordered us to distribute is rotten.
They're attacking musketeers
all over the city.
Get the gate!
We'll fire a volley
into them.
No. Close the gates.
Do not fire.
It's D'Artagnan.
Citizens of Paris,
listen to me. I am one of you.
We're starving!
They give us garbage
not even fit for rats!
Listen to me.
Listen to me, I beg you!
You're right.
It is rotten.
I will speak
to the King myself.
You have my word on it.
And you will release those men
for they serve France, you.
Louis,
you were right.
A woman has never
known love...
Until she's known
the love of a king.
I'm hungry.
I'll have some
food brought.
Oh. I like to eat alone.
By the way, you'll be
leaving tomorrow.
D'Artagnan,
these passageways...
Were made for the king's security, not
so you can startle me to death.
It is for your
security that I have come, Your Majesty.
I already know
about the rioting.
Your people are most
anxious to love you,
but they are eating
rotten food and sometimes none at all.
Rotten food?
I'll deal with that decisively.
There is another matter
of a more personal nature,
Your Majesty.
You're constantly
surrounded by beautiful women.
Do you love any of them?
Quite frequently, actually.
And they love you?
How do you know that when a woman
gives you her most intimate embrace...
That it is you and not your crown
that she pulls to her heart?
You think
my affairs are empty.
I think that
it is possible for one man...
To love one woman all his life
and be the better for it, yes.
You may be right.
Perhaps I haven't met a woman
with a heart like my own... Until recently.
Would that be Christine?
It is good that you watch me, but I
fear you watch me too closely.
Did you send Raoul
to the war so that you could pursue her?
Do you question my honor?
No, I do not
question your honor.
It's you I care about.
Raoul will return soon.
You have my word.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
D'Artagnan.
I am a young king...
But I am king.
Then be a good king,
Your Majesty.
You're the new chief advisor.
Execute him for distributing rotten food.
And the next time
there are rioters, shoot them.
Over there.
Wait. Please take this
to the royal dispatchers.
Christine!
I'll get you some water
in a moment, Mother.
His Majesty regrets to inform you...
That Raoul, son of Athos,
has been killed in action.
Sir, a casualty
report came.
Does Athos know this?
Athos, my friend...
Stop there,
you traitor.
My ear!
Stop him!
Athos, listen to me.
Listen to me.
The cannons killed Raoul.
Do not add your own
death to this tragedy.
I beg you.
Get back. Get back!
You're the traitor.
See to the wounded.
Does your
new apartment suit you?
Sire, when you sent for me
after the news of Raoul,
I just came to ask
for your help.
I have no way
to feed my family.
My father is dead
and my mother has...
A sickness of the lungs. And your sister
has early signs of the condition.
But my physician
has seen them both and is optimistic.
They will recover well
at my country estate.
Oh, Your Majesty...
I know this day for you
the earth has spun around more than once,
and you must still
feel it spinning.
Let us sit
at a quiet dinner...
And see if we may not
bring it to a pause.
Listen to me.
You have lost someone
dear to your heart.
I have no desire for you to sit here
trying to turn that heart to stone.
I only ask you this,
that whatever
you feel tonight,
you allow yourself
to share it openly with me.
To good health.
You are so beautiful.
I cannot do this.
Christine...
I hope you know
that there is more of me to love...
Than a crown.
Of all the wonders I have seen...
I've never
looked upon anything as beautiful as you.
Aramis,
is this the way to hell?
Hell may be our destination,
but not this trip.
A tomb.
We're in a tomb?
The secrecy is regrettable,
but necessary.
Please sit.
When we were young men...
And we saw injustice,
we fought it.
Now we know that some problems
cannot be solved with a sword.
And some can't be
settled without one.
Here is the problem
at hand.
The Jesuits
oppose Louis' wars...
And the starvation
that results.
So, Louis has ordered me...
To discover the true identity of
the general of the Jesuit Order...
And to kill him.
Let the secret general
worry about that.
The problem is that...
I am he.
I am the general
of the Order of Jesuits.
What do you
propose to do?
Replace the King.
I cannot listen to this.
It can't be done.
It can. I know the way.
I am with you.
So am I.
No.
I need you.
All for one,
one for all.
You cannot ask me
to betray my king. I have sworn an oath.
When a king is dishonorable,
you are removed from your oath of honor.
An oath is an oath precisely
because it cannot be removed!
Why do you follow him?
Why?
What we fought for is greater
than king or rank or reward.
What do you fight for now?
I fight for the belief that
every man can be better, even Louis.
Whatever the plan,
I am with you.
The next time we meet,
one of us will die.
Athos, wait.
D'Artagnan.
Even were I
not a priest,
I could see that your heart
carries a secret weight,
and that it is hurting you
to bear it alone.
I cannot betray... My King.
I will defend him
with my life.
Then God go with you...
For none of us will.
I understand that there was an
incident at the musketeers' gate...
Where a man came,
intent on killing me.
Is it our policy now to allow
would-be assassins to go free?
What he wished to kill
was his own pain.
His son is dead.
I can think of nothing worse.
What about losing your king?
That depends on the king.
When I became a musketeer,
I was told that each time I drew my sword,
I should consider
not what I was killing,
but what I was
allowing to live.
Do you know
who told me that?
Athos.
Now if he has become
our enemy...
We should ask ourselves why.
Well, Athos is gone.
Porthos and Aramis
are missing too.
You know them better
than anyone.
Are they a threat to me?
If they are a threat, then we need not seek
them out. They will find us.
Not if you find them first.
Who is this then?
He says
he's a replacement.
He says it's only one day a month
when the prisoner gets confession.
The usual priest
is too sick to move.
It is my confession day.
I'm sorry. You've never seen me
before. I must shock you.
I'm a friend.
I'm here to help you.
What are you doing?
It is an escape,
your escape to freedom.
Who is this?
He is you.
He says he just fell
stone dead...
As he was reading him
the mass.
How could he just keel over?
He says the prisoner
has a feverjust like the other priest does.
Plague. Plague!
They brought plague in here.
Get him out of here.
Get him out
of here now! Get out!
No last rites!
Get away!
We could chisel it off...
And see who he was.
No one will ever know.
He says burn it
or we'll all get plague. I think he's right.
Don't! Don't touch me!
Get out.
Stay back, he's got plague.
Stay back. Get out!
Hurry up!
Be off!
Hurry! Hurry!
Get away.
Go away. Hurry.
Hurry.
Okay.
My God.
Whoa.
Whoa. Whoa.
Jesuits.
They're mine.
Here.
Drink.
It's all right.
I have waited
six years...
To ask this question:
Why was this
done to me?
You don't know?
What do you remember?
I lived in a country house.
I had guardians... An old woman
and a priest... But no friends.
Then they came
and took me to the prison.
Who came?
A man in black.
I never saw his face.
But he took me
to the prison...
And he put me into the mask.
And you don't know why?
For days, I shouted,
"What have I done?"
Then I realized that there was
something about my face...
Which had to be hidden...
But I never knew
what it was.
What is your name?
The old woman called me...
Phillippe.
Phillippe.
These men are going
to help clean you up. They won't harm you.
Thank you.
Thank you
for your kindness.
Why are you so glum?
I expected action. There was no killing.
There was no fighting.
I was useless.
Porthos...
I grow tired
of this attitude.
You're surrounded
by beauty,
by intrigue, by danger.
What more can a man want?
Look around you!
The robins are singing.
The pigeons are cooing.
Can't you listen
to their song?
There's plenty of food
in the country.
It's just Louis
sends it all to the Army.
I have no appetite
for food.
I'm wasting away.
Even women don't
interest me anymore.
No, say good-bye
to Porthos, for he is gone.
Who is he?
You seek facts
where you should be seeking the truth.
You're not my priest, Aramis.
You would not be, even if I had one.
That's bitter.
The loss of Raoul
and of D'Artagnan,
who you held as a brother,
and now you hate.
What gives you the right to judge me, to
play god with the lives of others?
Is it because
you're so much holier than everyone else?
Well, yes, there is that, but also because
I'm more intelligent than anybody else.
Porthos,
what is it?
Kidney stones.
It hurts when I piss.
It hurts when I shit.
I'm just a fat old fart
with nothing to live for anymore.
I'm going
to hang myself...
As soon as I'm sober.
Come on.
Aramis.
He's ready.
The greatest mystery
of life...
Is who we truly are.
Yes.
Now I'm going to tell you
that secret...
That has been kept from you
for the whole of your life.
It began the night
King Louis was born.
I remember that night.
D'Artagnan, Athos
and I were dining.
D'Artagnan was dead drunk.
The only time I've ever
seen him like that.
But I was on duty.
I was summoned
to a rear door of the palace...
Where the Queen's own priest
placed a baby in my arms.
Do you understand this, Athos?
It confuses me.
The Queen had given birth
to twins that night.
The child I carried
was the younger of the two.
Another.
It's another.
Suddenly the old King
discovered he had two heirs.
He'd seen enough
kingdoms torn apart by feuding brothers,
so he decided, for the sake of
peace, to make one of them disappear.
You, Phillippe.
He ordered your true
identity kept from you.
On his deathbed, he revealed your
existence to Louis and your mother.
She had been told by her own
priest that you had died at birth.
She blamed herself
for ever believing it,
and she wished to restore
your birthright.
But now Louis was king.
He was afraid to kill you.
His whole claim of power
rested on the sanctity of royal blood.
So, instead, he devised a way
to keep you forever hidden.
For my country...
For my king...
I bought peace...
With your life...
And with my soul.
One day... I will ask
for your forgiveness.
But not until
I have restored you to what is yours.
Restored?
We will replace Louis
with Phillippe.
That is your plan?
Exchanging one
for the other?
It's ludicrous!
I can assure you,
it's brilliant.
What did you imagine
we were up to?
Revolution! Open war!
Blood in the streets.
At least it's a change.
Physical resemblance
is but a beginning. Louis has an arrogance.
Which
can be adopted.
And people
close to him.
Do you imagine
that I have not considered everything?
Have you considered it is not only our lives
that you risk? It is Phillippe's as well.
Yes! And, like us,
he has a choice.
What about it, Phillippe?
All those years
in prison.
Were they
for nothing?
Or have they given you
reserves of strength unlike ordinary men?
You have the chance
to be a king...
If you have the heart
to take that chance.
Do you have that heart,
Phillippe?
Do you?
I...
Do you?
Your Majesty,
a box has arrived with strict instructions...
That its contents
are for your eyes alone.
Take this to my mother.
My son.
My son.
Please...
Forgive me.
I can never make it right.
My Lady.
D'Artagnan.
No. No.
If anyone sees,
it is death.
If I don't kiss you,
I'll die anyway.
I cannot bear
to see you cry.
Please...
Tell me
what's wrong.
Anne...
I know that to love you
is a treason against France,
but not to love you
is a treason against my heart.
Then we will both die
traitors, D'Artagnan.
More wine.
More wine.
How is he?
Exhausted.
He's had a long day.
Aramis...
More wine!
You must reconsider
this plan. Phillippe is like a child.
He cannot possibly
be ready...
You can do it.
No, I can't.
Yes, you can.
In one year,
maybe two. I...
Three weeks.
Three weeks?
The King is having a ball,
a masquerade ball.
A swirl of people,
their faces covered.
It is our perfect opportunity,
and maybe the only one.
Phillippe will be discovered
at any time, and what then?
More wine!
Where is everybody?
No.
It's no use.
My sword is bent.
It will be all right.
You're just taking a while
to get started.
I can make
your sword straight.
No, it's dead.
It's dead.
I'm useless.
Useless.
Three weeks to learn
all that he must know?
For 16 years
he was educated as a gentleman.
Yes, and for six more
he lived in that mask, not knowing why.
Now he knows that those
who should have loved him,
tore him from his birthright
and threw him into loneliness and pain.
You're very fond of him.
That's good.
Do not play god with me,
Aramis. Nothing can replace Raoul.
What is Porthos doing?
Walking into
the barn naked,
or so it would seem.
But what
is he doing?
About to hang himself,
I should think.
He's been threatening
to do it for months.
Hang himself?
Oh, mon Dieu.
A sign from God.
Oh, mon Dieu.
If Porthos is determined
to end his life,
then he's bound to find
the opportunity, isn't he?
Good-bye, cruel world.
Farewell to useless Porthos.
What was that?
It's all right.
I sawed the beam.
I'm a genius,
not an engineer.
Is he still there?
Aramis, you did this!
You knew I would try hanging
myself, and you sawed the beam!
Admit it! Admit it!
Of course I knew.
You've been moping around for months!
Maybe now that you've got the idea
of killing yourself out of your head,
you can stop boring
everybody and be useful,
for a change!
Well...
And put some clothes on.
Well, okay.
I've worn this mask so long,
I don't feel safe without it.
I will sit with you.
I can't sleep either.
I've been in prison
for six years.
You have freed me.
But now you're asking me
to enter another prison.
The palace
is hardly a prison.
You see those farm maids
working there?
See the one
holding the lamb?
I would tend lambs with her
for the rest of my life.
We're offering you a chance...
To be king.
No.
You're offering me a chance
to pretend to be king.
A king that you hate.
Not everyone hates him.
Don't you?
Why should I become him?
Until you give me a reason,
I won't do it.
I cannot.
We're all God's instruments,
whether we like it or not.
All we can do is
to keep faith.
Even though I admit
I sometimes find that hard to do.
We all fail at faith,
Aramis, you know?
That's why we must eat,
drink and make love to life.
As king,
if you like ploughmaids,
- you can have a thousand.
- Porthos.
Huh?
You missed
the point.
What point?
Phillippe is right.
We haven't given him
a reason...
To do what
we ask of him.
I understand
your reason, Athos.
You understand my reason?
Porthos told me
about your son.
And you think
that's why I'm here?
Yes, Raoul is my reason,
but not in the way you think.
Once all of us believed
in spending our lives...
In the service
of something greater than ourselves.
Aramis had his faith,
Porthos, his lust for life,
D'Artagnan, his devotion.
And I had Raoul.
But we all had
a common dream:
One day, we would finally be able to
serve a king worthy of the throne.
It is what we dreamt,
what we bled for,
and what we have spent
a lifetime waiting to see.
I taught Raoul
to believe in that dream.
And now my son is dead.
So I am here to find out
if his life was in vain.
The only one who can answer
that question is you.
Athos, if we fail
in this attempt,
and we probably will,
I'll be honored
to die beside you.
And you.
This has arrived
for you.
My darling Christine,
in parting from you,
I have left heaven for hell.
I go because
I can love you only in honor.
You've created in me
the need to be a better man.
I will love through
heaven or hell,
if that is where
I must go...
To love you
as you should be loved.
Remember that
and give yourself no blame.
Yours forever, Raoul.
What's wrong?
What's the matter?
What's wrong?
I received
a letter from Raoul.
He sent it
to the palace,
knowing that
he would die...
And I would be here.
How would
he know that?
I...
I can't guess
what he was thinking.
He was irrational.
I ordered him placed
far from the fighting, but...
He plunged in...
Against my wishes.
He forgives me for all
that he knew I would do.
But can I forgive myself?
Forgive?
I loved him, Louis.
I love him still.
Still?
In pretending to love you,
I do something awful.
You pretend?
I have sinned against love and
God for the sake of your mercy,
which you would
not have given without my sin.
I will burn in hell.
So will you.
No, no, no.
No, my love.
You will burn in hell.
I will not,
for I am king,
ordained by God!
Come on, come on! We have no time!
- Here! My bag!
- Where are you going?
Paris.
There's still much to be done.
I'll be gone a few days. Make sure
everything is ready when I get back.
You want me to do the impossible, and
you want me to do it alone?
I offer you
the perfect solution:
a revolution
without bloodshed,
without loss of life,
even without treason.
He, too, is the son
of a king. Thank you.
- But I can't get him ready.
- Porthos, come on.
We'll never
have time.
The urgency is not my choice. Instead of
distributing the food, as he promised,
Louis has ordered
that all rioters be shot.
Go on.
Can you imagine what will happen...
When the starving
people of Paris hear about his new ball?
This is not for me, Athos.
This is for everything
we once were, and might be again.
Thank you, Father.
The ball has been
brought forward to tomorrow night.
Tomorrow? Why?
The King is unhappy
with his mistress...
And seeks revelry
to lift his spirits.
I cannot be ready unless my tailors
work all night. Saddle my horse!
The brothel is closed
for the night!
Everybody out,
except the ladies! Out!
Closed?
We came here...
You must go somewhere
else tonight. Out! Out!
Ladies, I need you
to finish my clothes you're making for me.
We'll go, and we'll take
your money with us.
Come on, old man.
Quickly!
Old? You try to rob me
because you think me old?
Let's see if you'll rob
somebody with your pistol up there.
Out! Out!
Everybody out!
Out! Out! Get out!
Porthos...
I finish this for you.
I love Paris, I love life,
and I love you, ladies.
Now get busy,
except for you.
No, wait.
With a king, it is so.
Servants have touched
the goblet of the king.
Therefore, he will touch it
as little as possible. Again.
I'm sorry.
No.
- I didn't...
- No.
Do not be sorry. There are no
mistakes when you are the king.
You must never apologize.
The king cares for nothing
and for no one.
Is that the kind of king
you wish me to be?
Or do you say this to me
because your son is dead?
Forgive me.
I would never mean to disrespect...
I'm not angry with you.
Do you understand?
Good. Now, of course, we
wish you to be a good king.
But first you must pass as
Louis, and Louis is cold and cruel.
The eyes of this king say
that he cares for nothing at all but himself.
Your eyes
ask too much.
You shouldn't care about me.
You shouldn't care...
You mustn't ask
about my son...
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
So have I.
Aramis?
Your Majesty.
I have come to ask you whether you
believe just as one lie can destroy a life,
so one truth can
put it together again?
I have prayed every day
for such a miracle.
And I have
prayed every day for forgiveness.
But now I know that forgiveness
must first come from you...
Before it can
come from God.
For it was I who took the second of
your twin sons away from you.
And I was never brave enough
to find the truth...
When I was told
one lie after another.
I have raised a son who destroys lives,
instead of saving them.
And I have failed
to save a son...
Who died within
an iron mask.
No! That mask was
the creation of Louis.
But now God and we
have the chance to make a miracle...
That could strip
all masks away forever.
These rooms are yours.
Through this corridor
and up the stairway...
Or through this secret passageway
to the floor above...
Are the rooms
of your mistress, Christine.
And whose rooms are these?
These rooms
are your mother's.
My mother's?
Change the horses!
Clear out everything!
Now!
Remember, Phillippe,
nobility is born in the heart.
Make love as if you don't
care, and fart whenever you wish.
Hold your goblet with two fingers.
All you have to do
is get through tonight. Smile and nod a lot.
If you get stuck, just wave
and announce, "Continue. "
And in the morning, you order that
Athos, Porthos and Aramis...
Be brought to the palace
as your advisors.
And all will be well.
D'Artagnan
watches everything. We have to be lucky.
We make our own luck tonight,
if Phillippe holds up.
Relax, Phillippe.
You're doing well.
My brother.
What is wrong,
Your Majesty?
Nothing. Carry on.
Did you see that?
See what,
Your Majesty?
A mask.
I distinctly saw a mask.
The ballroom
is full of masks, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty?
Carry on, everyone.
Is he all right?
To the passageway.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty!
It's judgment day.
Don't look
so shocked, Phillippe.
Phillippe? Why do you
call me Phillippe?
We have
a present for you.
D'Artagnan guards
the hallway.
We must go back
the way we came.
Time to go,
Your Majesty.
You know the way.
You have the heart
of a king.
Continue.
Your Majesty.
Some refreshments,
Your Majesty?
The Queen Mother.
God bless the King
and the Queen Mother!
God bless the King
and the Queen Mother!
God bless the King
and the Queen Mother!
God bless the King
and the Queen Mother!
Porthos!
I retire now.
Wait two dances,
then withdraw to your room...
And spend the night
in safety.
We have much
to talk about...
And have the rest
of our lives to do it.
Good night...
Mother.
Good night...
My son.
Anne... What...
Tomorrow.
How long
has the King been back?
Some while, Captain.
Murderer!
Murderer.
Christine?
I wrote to the front
under your seal.
I wrote as you,
demanding to know...
Why the General disregarded
the order to keep Raoul out of danger.
He writes back:
"But, Your Majesty,
your last letter ordered me to place him...
"At the vanguard
of the assault,
"just in front
of the cannon. "
Guards.
You killed Raoul!
You killed Raoul!
You killed Raoul!
Take your hands off her!
- Let me go!
- You're hurting her!
However I have wronged you,
I will make amends.
Take her to her room.
Deploy the musketeers.
Guard all the passages.
Continue.
We have an emergency
of security, Your Majesty.
I must ask you
to accompany me.
Not now, the ball...
My guests.
I insist...
Your Majesty.
Yes, certainly.
They've raised the alarm!
They'll try
to cut us off.
Reverse the flow!
I am Porthos!
And I fight the King!
Look out.
Come on. Porthos!
Come along!
Everyone pump!
Stop them...
Before they reach the river!
Pull them back!
This man is an impostor.
This...
Is the impostor.
Pull them back!
Get in the boat,
Your Majesty.
Open the gate.
Open the gate!
Open the gate.
I'm sorry I failed you.
We failed you.
Stop!
You take my king,
and I shall take yours.
Get them! Get them!
Seize the impostor! Get them!
Seize him!
Seize him! Stay back!
Seize him, everyone!
Phillippe!
Seize him! Take him!
Athos!
Hold onto him!
Athos!
Athos!
I was told
this impostor was dead.
You knew?
You knew there was a man
of such resemblance?
He is my brother.
Brother?
My twin.
My blood.
A fact which has kept
him alive until now.
Phillippe.
Louis... Please.
You were a part
of this too, Mother?
He's your brother!
I love you both!
And your love has meant
nothing to either of us!
It has meant
something to me.
Your Majesty,
listen to me.
Listen to me. Never once have I
ever asked anything for myself.
I ask you now:
Spare the life of this man,
this prisoner,
your brother!
You have no right
to ask me this!
Your Majesty...
Every day
of your life...
I have watched over you.
I have bled for you.
I have prayed every day...
To see you become greater
than your office,
better than the law.
Please show me what my faith and my
blood have purchased. Show mercy.
And you take
the side of traitors?
Of this one, worst of all, my own
brother, who's tried to do this to me!
And what have
you done to him?
For one moment,
I thought you had become the
king I always hoped you'd be.
Please...
My Lord, may I speak?
I beg that you kill me.
I release you from any sin
in taking my life.
In fact, I pray that God reward
you for your mercy to do it.
But, please...
Do not, I beg you...
Return me to the prison
where I have lived for so long.
D'Artagnan...
You will hunt down
Porthos, Athos and Aramis...
And bring me
their heads...
Or I will have yours.
And as for you,
my brother,
back to the prison
you shall go...
And into the mask you hate.
Louis, don't.
Wear it until you love it!
And die in it.
Anne.
There were two?
Not one, but two?
I couldn't tell you.
You had enough to bear.
Anne, I have
loved you always. None but you.
No matter what happens...
I pray you remember that.
Christine's room.
Where is she?
Get rid of it.
Where are you
taking me? No!
Where are you taking me?
Where are you taking me?
Please, no!
No, no. No! No!
No!
No! No!
No! No! No!
No! No!
No! No!
It has been done
as you ordered, Your Majesty.
When D'Artagnan
returns, watch him.
And when he leaves
again, you tell me.
Your Majesty.
Nothing down here, sir.
Try this way.
Phillippe has been
moved to the dungeon of the Bastille.
At midnight tonight,
I will order the guard changed...
And delay the replacements
for ten minutes.
One for all, all for one.
D'Artagnan.
It is a trap,
but we have no choice.
If Phillippe
is in the Bastille,
then to the Bastille
we will go.
I'd rather die
covered in blood...
Than an old man
lying in my own piss.
Our old uniforms...
From our days of glory.
I was saving them
so that...
We could wear them
in death.
And so we shall!
Open up.
We have a prisoner.
Take him down
to level three.
The Captain will see
to the document.
It worked.
It's a prison. Of course
it's no trouble getting in.
The problems will come
when we want to get out.
Here.
It's midnight.
We have ten minutes.
Down there.
Is this what
you're looking for?
The key.
No.
Remember this?
Don't look so sad.
There's nothing
left of him anyway.
He's just a sniveling,
drooling...
I knew you would
come for me.
We feared the mask
would destroy you.
I wear the mask.
It does not wear me.
The courtyard is blocked.
He lies.
He's here to trap us.
See for yourselves.
All that you have suffered,
I would gladly have borne
myself to keep it from you.
You men to the east gate.
D'Artagnan is right.
The courtyard is filling with soldiers.
This way.
Don't stop till you
reach the river.
If we go this way,
they'll know you helped us.
It doesn't matter now.
Go.
Fire!
Get that door!
That beam.
Trapped.
Charge them!
Spare their lives,
if you can.
Cowards!
Twenty men run from four?
The corridor
nullifies our number,
and no one has the stomach
to fight the Captain.
Charge!
Here's a weapon.
D'Artagnan...
I am not angry
with you.
I knew you would
lead me to them, and so you have.
Lay down your sword,
and I will not punish you.
I will let you
retire in peace,
and I will
give your friends a swift execution...
If you surrender now!
Perhaps you should
take his offer.
You're dead anyway.
He's right, D'Artagnan.
Wait.
Bargain me to Louis
for all your lives. You've done your best.
Please, let me go.
No.
I cannot do it.
Even if I could
give up my king,
I could never
give up... My son.
Your son?
I loved your mother.
I love her still.
You are my son.
I never knew you existed,
and I never...
Felt pride as a father...
Until this moment.
D'Artagnan...
They're young musketeers.
They've been weaned
on our... Legends.
They revere us.
It is an advantage.
Yes. Why don't
we charge them?
I trained these men.
They will fight...
To the death.
But if we must die...
If we must die...
Let it be like this.
One for all.
All for one.
Shoot.
Magnificent valor.
Shoot them.
Fire!
- D'Artagnan.
- D'Artagnan.
You vicious, evil...
Get off me!
Get off me!
Phillippe. Phillippe.
He is... Your brother.
Brother?
Outside, all of you.
You're sworn to silence.
Get this off me!
Get this off me!
Forgive me.
All my life...
This... This is the death...
I have always wanted.
All for one.
One...
You...
Were the one in the mask.
All my life,
all I ever wanted
to be... Was him.
We have recaptured
the prisoner.
No!
No, I am the...
You'll put this madman
where no one can hear his insanity.
Let him be fed
by a deaf-mute.
But feed him well.
And let him find redemption in wearing
the pains he has placed on others.
Take him.
And them?
They are my Royal Council
and truest friends.
In nomine Patris...
E filli et Spiritus Sancti.
Amen.
He was the best
of us all.
Athos.
After all you have done,
I must ask you one more service.
Let me love you
like a son to a father.
And I pray
you live for this...
To love me like your son.
Musketeers... Salute!
One for all, all for one!
The prisoner in the iron mask
was never found.
It was whispered among his jailers that
he received a royal pardon...
And was taken to the country
where he lived quietly,
visited often by the Queen.
The King known as Louis XIV
brought his people...
Food, prosperity and peace,
and is remembered
as the greatest ruler...
In the history of his nation.
