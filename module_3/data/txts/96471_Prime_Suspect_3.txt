PRIME SUSPECT
Episode 3 - Part 2
The Keeper Of Souls
Saturday afternoon,
this bloke´s in town doing his shopping.
Suddenly he starts screaming and shouting.
"I am sick of people in this town
calling me a sheepshagger! "
"Listen, I deliver milk to the local school -
nobody calls me the milk giver.
I give clothes to the jumble sale -
nobody calls me the clothes giver.
I help at the local community centre -
nobody calls me the community worker.
I shag one sheep... "
It´s brilliant, it´s brilliant. Yeah.
I´ve just heard -
we didn´t get anything off the Smithy tapes.
This just came through. I´ve been doing
a bit of digging after a tip-off.
1979- a Mr Edward Parker
was accused of molesting a boy in his care
when he ran a home for kids in Manchester.
Case dismissed. Lack of evidence.
Anthony Field.
1986- indecent assault on a minor.
Case dismissed.
Same Mr Edward Parker again,
this time running the Calloway Centre
in Cardiff, another home for kids.
Jason Baldwin.
You´re saying
this Edward Parker´s the same...
Could be Edward Parker-Jones.
I´ve got the addresses of the two kids.
I´d be up in Manchester and back by tonight.
- Manchester?
- Yeah. Cross over to Cardiff.
Nice to get something on Parker-Jones, eh?
- Dig a bit of dirt.
- Yeah. I´ll do it, I´ll go.
You? I thought you´d wanna be here.
No.
Give me a chance to talk to Dalton.
Er, Richard, can I have a word with you?
I don´t bloody believe this.
I do all the legwork and she gets a day away.
Didn´t have time this morning
to do a briefing,
so let´s do it now and then crack on.
We know that Jackson
would have taken about ten minutes
from the Advice Centre
to Vernon Reynolds´ flat and back.
There are two possible routes. Richard,
get a team together, blanket the area.
- Any news on Jackson?
- No, we haven´t found him yet.
That´s brilliant.
Go to his old hunting ground, stations
That´s where you picked him up first.
We´ve got a good motive now
for Connie´s murder...
and we all know that it wasn´t robbery.
What are you muttering about, Bill?
I was just saying
it´s a pity about the Smithy tapes.
They´re useless. Connie never named anyone,
guv, apart from Jackson.
Just some clubs where he met his clients.
Er, yeah. No addresses as yet.
But the clubs are Bowery Roof,
Lola´s, Judy´s,
and something that sounded like Puddles.
Poodles. It´s called Poodles.
The other two are gay bars.
But the Bowery Roof is
a very exclusive place.
Lots of drag acts,
transsexuals, transvestites.
Most members are city types. Professionals.
You´re a bit well-informed.
I only just got these.
I´m a member.
Are you joking, Ray?
- That´s not funny.
- I know it isn´t.
I´m gay.
You took your time in telling us. I mean,
I know it´s your own private business...
- I´ll leave the team if that´s what you want.
- No, wait a minute. No. Sit down.
Which of those clubs do you think
are most likely to be frequented by...
- Judges, MPs?
...police officers?
The Bowery.
- You well-known there?
- No.
It´s very expensive.
I´ve only been twice.
But I do know one thing.
Asking questions with the others in tow - never
get past the front door and word would leak.
You´d never even get to the top brass,
let alone ask them questions.
What about access to membership lists?
- No chance.
- Shit.
Most of them use false names or coded names.
Even though what they´re doing
is perfectly legal.
But if they are going with underage kids,
that ups the ante even further on covering up.
So who they are
would be really hush-hush.
I mean, they´ve really got
to protect themselves.
One hint of a leak and they´ll close ranks.
uless...
We could get the lads to drag up.
Go in that way.
- Nobody pays any attention to them.
- Oh, yeah, right!
I´d pay to see that.
Go and get some lunch. Oh, and tell Dalton
to get his skates on, will you?
- We´ve got a train to catch.
- Sure.
Thanks, Ray.
Only one name off the Smithy tapes.
- But it´s your man. It´s Jackson.
- I know. Lets you off the hook, doesn´t it?
Just a joke.
Look, Jack, it may not be the time
to talk about this,
but it´s gotta be obvious to you
that this case, it´s opening right up.
It´s treading on Operation Contract´s heels.
It´s my honest opinion
that we should just cut our losses
and concentrate on
the murder investigation, because...
I´m getting information that goes a whole lot
deeper than a clean-up of street kids.
I think Colin Jenkins
was murdered to silence him
because he was about to name the men
involved in a paedophile ring.
And you think Parker-Jones is involved.
Well, he´s being very helpful,
very co-operative.
I don´t have a shred of evidence
to link him with any paedophile ring, but...
the Advice Centre,
along with a number of other venues...
And what about Jackson?
I think that he murdered Colin Jenkins.
- But...
- But?
It´s uh... It´s nothing.
You´d better reel in Jackson, then.
You have a very impressive career.
Don´t blow it.
Charge Jackson...
...and bury everything else.
You´ve not said anything, Bill.
What do you think?
What, about him? Don´t worry me.
We had one at Southampton Row.
He didn´t last long.
- See you in the pub, then.
- Yeah.
- Is it true?
- What? That I´m gay?
I just don´t believe in this day and age
everybody´s making such a big deal of it.
What are you looking at me like that for?
I just don´t understand.
- I thought I knew you.
- You do.
- Why?
- Are you asking me why I´m gay?
It´s the way I am. Always have been.
Queer?
Yeah.
Queer.
I´m gay. I don´t apologise for it.
Look at you.
The other two will come out
with infantile, puerile cracks from now on.
I just don´t believe it.
- Do you live with a bloke?
- Do you?
- Of course I bloody don´t.
- What difference does it make?
My private life is just that.
I don´t poke my nose in yours.
What gives you the right to ask about mine?
Because I work with you!
As a matter of fact...
I do live with somebody.
And I´m very happy... thank you.
Listen, I was gay before I met you.
Didn´t start touching you up,
or propositioning you,
did I?
I respect you. Why don´t you respect me?
Now back off.
- Manchester. There´s a coincidence.
- Is there?
It´s just I was supposed
to meet a friend from there just now.
Give you a lift, yeah? I´m in a car.
Come on.
Hello? It´s Tennison.
I´m at Euston on my way to Manchester.
Yeah, then Cardiff.
Listen, I want a car followed.
A dark blue Mercedes. Old four-door saloon.
Yeah, I´ll get the number to you.
The suspect´s name is James Jackson.
OK? I want him tailed but not apprehended.
Get Otley and Hall on it.
It´s Larry Hall. Put me through to Vice.
We´re outside Jackson´s house now.
Kathy,
anything on the house in Langley Road yet?
Look, I will call you back as soon
as I´ve got anything, all right?
Right.
- Shit.
- What?
Billy Matthews. Madam wants him requestioned
about the Connie video.
It´s all very well her saying arrest him,
but we´ve been doing that for the past year.
He´s only had four court appearances already.
Charing Cross Hospital. Emergency Ward.
Yes, got it. Edward Jones.
Property owned by an Edward Jones.
First floor - Margaret Fuller. Second...
Basement - Abdul... unpronounceable.
God, it´s flatlets. Brilliant.
- Guess what?
- What?
Billy Matthews discharged himself
an hour after we left him there.
Do you know
where I can get my batteries recharged?
Hello? Hello-o-o?
- Hello-o-o?
- Guv.
Just a minute. Hello? Can you hear me?
Hello?
... phone.
Hello? Oh, hello.
Listen, you can gain entry even on suspición
that a minor is being held there.
Well, I´m reporting it, OK?
It isn´t about the bank, is it?
Only Anthony´s sure to be made
assistant manager
and I just wondered...
Sorry to keep you waiting. Only just got in.
- Is the kettle on, Ma?
- Yes, yes.
When it whistles, I´ll hear it, if you want
to go and listen to your programme.
Well, I...
Sorry. I got cold feet as you were late.
Sorry about that.
We don´t need a warrant.
We´ve reason to believe you´re holding
a minor. You were seen leaving Euston.
Bullshit.
I know my rights, now piss off.
You´ve got no warrant.
You´re on private property.
I have, as a citizen,
a right to defend my property. Now piss off.
- Are you Mrs Margaret Fuller?
- Yes.
Is this the juvenile
I´m supposed to have prisoner?
Anybody up there? This is the police!
Leave him alone.
I just wanna see the kid´s all right.
- I´ll break his arms.
- She´s up here.
Get out of here! You´re dead, Vera!
And this is my er...
My dad and my little sister.
They were killed in a car crash
when I was five.
And after that, Mum had a nervous breakdown.
That´s why I was sent to the home.
Anthony, can you tell me about
the court case?
Look, I know how difficult it is.
Really?
I need to know
about the man who ran the home.
You see, it´s my belief that he´s still...
At it?
Mm.
His um...
His name was Edward Parker.
My case never even got to court.
Jesus.
I´ve called an ambulance.
The other kid´s being taken in now.
- Vera wants to go.
- I´m doing a club tonight.
Can I go?
I´m doing the cabaret.
You won´t get any sense out of him.
- He´ll tell you anything just to stay here.
- I´m OK, I´m OK.
You´re not OK, Billy, love.
You´re not OK at all.
Can I go?
- Where´s that bloody ambulance?
- They said there´d be a 15- minute delay.
- Don´t leave me.
- It´s all right, Billy, lad.
He had a special nickname for me
He said that whenever he used
that special name it was a code.
That was when he wanted me
to go to his room.
And how long did this abuse go on for...
before you told anyone?
Three years.
There was no-one to tell.
He always said that... if I told anyone...
...I would have to eat my own faeces.
I got a letter from my mother.
She said she was much better.
So... I ran away.
I went to the police station...
and er... they called in a social worker.
A woman.
I had to tell her. It was very embarrassing.
How old were you then?
Eight, nearly nine.
They took my statement and then er...
...a plain-clothes police officer
came into the room to question me.
Anthony,
I really appreciate you telling us all this.
Can you go on?
Thank you.
This um... police officer -
I never knew his name -
he er, he asked me if I...
...if I knew what happened
to little boys that tell lies.
And then I said I was not telling lies.
And he said er...
...well, we will soon know.
And um...
...um...
...he er... he undid my pants...
and er...
And he did it to me.
He said that um... that if I told anyone,
I would go to prison.
This police officer penetrated you?
Mm.
- At the police station?
- Mm-hm.
Was anyone else present?
So...
I said that I was, that I had been,
telling lies.
Case dismissed.
They er... they sent me back to the home.
I was there for another two years.
Mm.
I sincerely believe the man
who assaulted you...
I´m not interested in what you believe.
I´m only interested in my life
and my career.
Whatever happens to him now
is no longer my concern.
I refuse to let him destroy my life.
- But you´ll let him destroy others.
- No. You let him.
I don´t care about anyone else.
If where was a court case - if -
then I´d be forced to relive
what that bastard did to me... again.
I only agreed to see you on condition
that you didn´t want me to go to court.
I won´t testify.
And you can´t make me.
So I told Halliday this morning.
I said, "We should just put
Operation Contract quietly to bed. "
You worked on it for six months, didn´t you?
I worked on it for six months.
Doing surveillance on all the areas
we targeted. Right.
On the night earmarked for the big swoop,
Friday,
we got less than we would have done
on a wet Tuesday afternoon.
Listen, did you target Edward Parker-Jones?
Why do you ask that?
I know you sent those faxes
to Otley about the case.
One in Manchester, the other in Cardiff.
Look, I´m going to be
totally honest with you.
I Xeroxed these before I left,
just more or less to protect myself
in case there was any shit.
Dig in to these.
I think they go away back.
Maybe before me.
Chiswick´s the grand puppet master.
- Fancy a whisky upstairs?
- I´d love one.
- Ah.
- Um...
Toothbrush, toothpaste and er... I thought
you might need that. It´s make-up remover.
Aw. Thank you. That´s very thoughtful.
How much do I owe you?
Receipt´s in the bag.
This is Detective Chief
Inspector David Lyall.
David, this is Brian Dalton.
Detective Inspector Dalton.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Likewise.
- So, is your room OK?
- Yeah, room´s fine.
Good. OK. Well, I´ll see you tomorrow.
Early. OK?
- Night.
- Yeah, OK.
- Didn´t expect to stay the night.
- There you go.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
I hear very good things about you.
You´re not scared off anything. Well, I am.
There´s gonna be lots of us
demoted in our rank
and I know there´s a superintendent
vacancy coming up, so...
...you take these.
I´m sorry, but I´m looking out
for my future.
This Sheehy inquiry
has really put the flutter around.
The only ones safe will be those
with 30 years´ experience...
and I don´t fancy being demoted.
I worked hard enough
for the DCI rank as it is.
So there was a leak.
Tell me, what do you think of Bill Otley?
Good man.
One of the old school. Hard worker.
- Did he tell you that?
- About the leak? Yeah.
Well, I reckon I´ve done my favour.
- Good luck to you.
- Thanks, David.
Where is that vacancy?
It´s one of the AMIT areas. Everybody can´t
go up but I´m going to give it my best shot.
Good night, love.
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
My wife´s not gonna believe this.
- I told her I was off duty.
- It´s that film, innit? Some Like It Hot.
Tony Curtis and?
Jack Lemmon. It was dreadful. Silly walks.
They´d never have got away with it.
Anybody could see
they weren´t female.
That wasn´t the point though.
It was a comedy.
Well, for some, dear, being in drag
is the only time they feel right.
It is not funny at all... is it?
I wouldn´t know.
- How much did they set you back?
- A lot.
Red´s here now.
I´ve not got much time before I go on,
so let´s make it snappy.
One at a time. I don´t know if I can get you
in the back bar. It´s jammed in there.
- Maybe you can work it yourselves?
...a great favourite!
A truly beautiful and talented act.
Please welcome Miss Vera Reynolds!
# I wanna be loved by you
# Just you
# Nobody else but you...
Come on, let´s mingle.
#... loved by you alone
# Boo-boop-bee-doo
# I wanna be kissed by you
# Just you
# Nobody else but you...
- Are you crazy? Why? Why did you do it?
- Because they asked me to.
I´m out of here.
If you´d got any sense, you´d leave too.
- You´ve got another spot.
- You do it.
- I haven´t done my own yet.
- They stick out like sore thumbs.
They don´t.
- They´re asking everyone bloody questions!
- I want to help.
I thought you cared about Connie.
Somebody killed him. You know it, I know it.
- You might be able to stomach what goes on...
- Me?
You live with that slimebag,
Mark Lewis, not me.
I´ve never been involved in it all,
never...
But you are involved, aren´t you?
You lied to me.
I covered up for you, but all this stuff
with the kids and Jackson.
I´m shacking up at his place
because I´ve got nowhere else to go.
He won´t leave me alone till this blows over.
Now you´ve got the cops in here.
He´ll think I done it. Not you, me.
Red, those two queens of yours...
- You´ve got another spot, Vera.
- I´ll do it.
Christ.
Those two queens of yours -
I´ve had a complaint. They´ll have to go.
All right. I´ll come clean.
I don´t know ´em.
They latched on to me at Lola´s club.
They gave me a few quid to get ´em in.
It´s the truth, I swear before God.
Now, can I have a bit of privacy?
My tits need readjusting.
Hey, Vera!
I bloody protected you, you slag!
And you bring the filth into my house!
- Why did you do that, then, Vera?
- It wasn´t me.
I swear before God, Jimmy, it wasn´t me.
I wouldn´t, would I?
- What?
- I need you.
Why would I tip off the law about you?
Who is it to do with, then, eh?
Is it Red?
How much does he know?
Eh?
Where´s Red?
I don´t know. He´s not on tonight.
He had a cold.
He´s staying at Mark Lewis´s.
It´s the truth, Jimmy, honestly.
That´s how he knows everything.
? Techno
Bloody thing.
? Techno
- Where the bloody hell were you?
- I was over there!
- Why didn´t you call out?
- Have you got any handcuffs?
Oh, take a wild guess.
Skipper, it´s about Billy Matthews.
- Is he dead?
- No, no, no. He´s got a bronchial infection.
He´s in Charing Cross Hospital. They won´t
treat him cos he keeps discharging himself.
He discharged himself last night
and he discharged himself on the 17th.
- 17th. The night Connie died, right?
- Yeah.
Discharged himself.
So he couldn´t have been at the centre.
- Exactly.
- Yeah, yeah, lovely.
Parker-Jones is very specific
about that, Billy.
Alan Thorpe - he was too pissed to remember.
We find those other two lads,
Jackson´s screwed, right?
- Fancy a hamburger?
- No, no. I´m knackered.
- Came off hours ago.
- On your bike. See you tomorrow.
All right.
I reckon he got a backhander.
You know Billy Matthews?
Well, when he first come up he was,
what, ten?
Connie nabbed Billy fast, didn´t he?
Do you think Connie
was paid for finding young kids, then?
- For the films, like.
- They´re all perverts.
Big posh houses, lot of dough.
Dirty bastards.
- You scruffy buggers didn´t go to posh houses.
- Yeah. Yeah.
Do you two want to drive around in the panda,
show me that posh house? Tenner in it for you.
OK. Come on.
Come on.
Come on, this is the fifth road.
Is it here or what?
That´s the one.
Has it got stone animals outside the gates?
Connie said they were lions.
Good lad. Remember anything else?
I think the lad´s pulling your leg, sarge.
This is Assistant Deputy Commissioner
Kennington´s home.
Drive on.
- You said Jason was known to the locals.
- He´s more than known.
He spends more time in the cells than out.
He´s a nice enough bloke when he´s sober,
but he´s a nightmare when he´s not.
He´s been had up for assault, petty crimes.
Has a lot of marital troubles.
She´s always calling us in
but then withdraws the charges.
Well, the bad news
isn´t even worth discussing.
Haskons and Lillie got dragged up.
- What?
- Don´t even ask.
The good news is they brought in Jackson.
- Are you serious? They got dragged up?
- I said I don´t wanna talk about it.
But there´s another alibi down. Driscoll.
He´s admitted that he lied because Jackson
threatened to beat him up. What number is it?
WPC: 63. 5th floor.
You´re from Liverpool right?
Yeah.
And um... how old were you
when you first went into the home?
- Which one?
- The one run by Edward Parker-Jones.
Ten.
I was sent there from a foster home.
I got into a bit of thieving,
so they got shot of me.
Are you prepared
to act as a witness for the prosecution?
Sure.
Thanks.
Can you tell me when
the sexual abuse started?
It was um... the second
or third day I was there.
Parker just called us
into his office and um...
That was it. It started then.
Like you could do or say anything about it.
It was like he was...
a law unto himself, you know.
And it wasn´t just me.
He was having us all.
He´d give you a certain amount of fags.
Like, it was five for a blow job.
You knew when one of the lads had gone all
the way with him - they was flush with fags.
- Have you got one by the way?
- Oh, yeah, sure.
Here.
Keep the pack. I´m trying to give up.
What made you report him?
Short-changed us on some fags, didn´t he?
So I thought... "Screw him. "
Went to the social worker. Bitch.
She fancied him, you know.
He used to get it off with women as well.
Anyway, she went on and on at me.
Did I know what I was saying? What it meant?
I said, "Yeah, I know what it means to me. "
If you don´t do something about it,
I´m going to the cops.
- And how old were you then?
- Dunno. 12, 13.
And did you go to the cops?
Yeah.
Well, he wouldn´t leave us alone, would he?
She wasn´t going to do
anything about it, so...
I went to the police station.
Made a statement.
They were all running round, like,
asking all these questions and then er...
...the doctor examined me and...
Er, yeah, and then um...
This copper gets me into his office
and then...
And what happened then, Jason?
Um...
He said that... if I said I was lying...
...he´d make it cushy for me,
give me money, cigarettes, things like that.
Said they´d move me somewhere nice.
Do you remember the police officer´s name?
Was he in uniform?
He was a friend of Parker´s.
They worked it together.
So anyway, they sent me back,
never got round to moving me.
And um...
I became a very heavy smoker.
Do you remember the doctor´s name?
The one that examined you.
That´s not going to help you much.
He died of cancer.
Nice fella.
His name was something... Ellis.
Well, that´s it for now, I think.
Thanks very much.
So, what are you doing now, Jason?
Have you got a job?
No. No qualifications.
Five-year-old kid reads better than I do.
I do odd jobs around the place. Fix up cars.
I get drunk.
Like if...
...sometimes I get a bit angry.
And then you get into trouble.
Have you ever told anyone else about this?
There´s no point, is there?
You just have to live with it.
I promise you we will do everything we can
to put this man away.
I promise you that, Jason.
You haven´t got him, have you?
Not yet, no.
Well, goodbye, then, Jason.
We´ll be in touch.
You know, one night at the home,
we was watching this documentary.
Sabe, it was a Nazi thing.
And this fella who ran
the concentration camp...
You know what they are?
Well, his name was the Ángel of Death.
And after the war he escaped, right?
He was never hanged. Nobody arrested him.
Nobody even brought him to trial.
That´s like Parker, isn´t it?
He did me for eight years.
He did everyone in his care.
You know what we used to call him?
We called him the "Keeper of Souls".
Jason, look, go back upstairs.
There´s glass around. You´ll hurt yourself.
You want to see what the Keeper did to me?
The man who did this will pay for it,
I promise you, Jason.
Look, I promise you.
You´ll just make your train.
Bronwen, can you do a crosscheck
on this for me, please?
- Check with social services.
- OK.
He´ll live.
Broken leg and hip bone. He´s OK.
- His wife and kid. I sent a cab for them.
- OK.
You know, Anthony and Jason?
That´s too much of a coincidence.
I mean, if Edward Parker-Jones moved on,
maybe so did that police officer.
Any developments on Jackson?
What?
- You said he´d been picked up.
- Oh, no.
What about you?
Heard from that hospital yet?
No, not yet.
- Still waiting.
- Oh? How long does it take?
I don´t know.
Don´t know.
What?
Well, when are you gonna come clean, Brian?
What do you mean?
When are you going to tell me
what a high-flyer like you...
is doing attached to this investigation?
I mean, look at you.
You´re university educated.
You´re Fraud Squad.
You´re hand-in-glove with Chiswick.
I know you report back to him,
for God´s sake.
Come on, you´re my mate.
You can tell me what´s going on.
I have to report back to Commander Chiswick.
Lf, and only if, your investigation
crosses another investigation.
Very good.
All right, you´ve started now.
So what investigation might that be?
It´s about the blackmail
of an assistant deputy commissioner.
He was, or had been,
on enforced leave for eight months.
Six months previous to the blackmail threats.
One of the most senior officers ever
to be subject to disciplinary procedures.
The matter was passed to the Home Office
from Scotland Yard.
Who the hell is it?
Assistant Deputy Commissioner
John Kennington.
What was going on before the blackmail?
Eight months enforced leave? Long time.
Must have been something big.
There´s possible involvement
with a paedophile ring.
Jason Baldwin´s social worker.
Margaret Spell. She´s now based in...
London. Thank you very much.
Kennington.
- Would you like some coffee?
- No, thank you.
- So, what can I do for you, Chief Inspector?
- Were you at one time working at Cardiff?
Yes. And in Liverpool.
I also worked in Birmingham.
Was Edward Parker-Jones
also working in Liverpool and Birmingham?
No.
Well, we can be thankful for that, can´t we?
Do you know Anthony Field?
No? Well, what about Jason Baldwin?
He was one time a resident...
Yes, yes, yes. I remember Jason.
Do you have a close relationship
with Edward Parker-Jones?
- I don´t think that´s any of your business.
- Yes, Margaret. It´s very much my business.
Jason tried to kill himself right
in front of me this afternoon.
He´s prepared to make a statement that when
he was in the care of Edward Parker-Jones,
he was sexually abused
for a period of six years...
and that you, at that time,
were his social worker.
You were Jason Baldwin´s social worker,
weren´t you, Margaret?
You were Jason´s social worker.
Yes.
Are you aware of these allegations?
Were you aware of them
when you were working in Cardiff?
Oh... Jason was always telling lies.
He was a compulsive liar.
Ten-year-old boy, Margaret.
You refused to believe him
and he had six more years of abuse.
Oh, God.
This is not true.
- If I´d have believed for one moment...
- Oh, you believe it, Margaret.
So, do you know Colin Jenkins?
No.
I was telling the truth. I...
I swear I didn´t even come here
till 18 months ago.
Edward contacted me.
He even tried to renew our relationship.
Are you sure?
I mean, these young boys, they´re always
making up stories. I remember Jason...
Do you recall a doctor?
Did a doctor examine Jason Baldwin?
Yes, of course he was examined.
Do you remember a police officer?
One who was close with Edward Parker-Jones?
You mean John Kennington.
Yes, yeah, it could be John Kennington.
Do you remember if he was plain clothes
or in uniform? What rank was he?
Um...
I think he was a superintendent.
I never saw him in uniform.
Do you know if this John Kennington
is still in touch with Edward Parker-Jones?
Er, yes, I think so.
If there anyone in this building who knows
where Detective Chief Inspector Tennison is?
On her way back from Cardiff.
Expecting her any moment now, boss.
And you two, as far as I am concerned,
behaved in an utterly farcical manner.
One which would,
if ever it were made public,
put not only myself but
this entire department in jeopardy.
In your office.
Just tell me, in God´s name,
what possessed you to do it?
We brought Jackson in, sir.
Sorry. I´ll be right with you.
DS Haskons, DC Lillie.
You will return to Southampton Row
as from tomorrow evening.
DI Ray Hebdon will leave... today.
Hey!
Get that crap down.
Naughty boys.
Well, this must be worth a bundle.
Kennington didn´t buy this in his wages.
Happens to be my wife´s.
Oh! I´m sorry, sir.
I´m Detective Chief Inspector Jane Tennison.
This is Detective Inspector Dalton,
that´s Brian Dalton.
So what seems to be the problem?
We´re making inquiries into
the death of a young boy. Colin Jenkins.
Did you know him, sir?
Do you know a James Jackson?
No.
- Anthony Field?
- No.
Jason Baldwin?
No.
What er... what are you doing here,
Chief Inspector?
Do you know Edward Parker-Jones?
Uh...
No, I can´t say that I do.
You were at one time stationed
in Manchester,
I believe. And before that
you were in Cardiff.
- Is that correct?
- Yeah.
Did you at any time come across
a social worker called Margaret Speel?
No, I´m sorry, I don´t recall the name.
Just before your recent resignation, sir,
you were about to instigate charges.
Could you tell me what they were?
What exactly is this inquiry about,
Chief Inspector?
Please just answer the question, sir.
I have no inclination
to answer anything else.
And I´d appreciate it if you would leave.
Maybe you would recollect Colin Jenkins.
Sometimes he was called Connie.
He would have been about 15 years old
when you knew him.
He was about my height. He had red hair.
He was a practising homosexual.
Will you both leave - now?
It´s just that I notice
that you have pictures of young boys here.
Those are my sons.
- Will you please leave my house?
- Was Colin Jenkins blackmailing you?
Edward Parker-Jones putting pressure on you?
Which of them was blackmailing you?
Were you aware that Colin Jenkins
was selling his story to the papers?
- I´m sorry. John?
- Mrs Kennington.
I am... Please.
Mrs Kennington, your husband
was answering some questions.
I´m investigating the death of a young boy,
just 17 years old. He was a rent boy.
His name was Colin Jenkins.
Maybe you read about it.
Hey, Mike.
Do you fancy a drink?
Sorry, I´m late as it is.
- Nothing wrong, is there?
- No, no.
I just wanted to have a word with you.
Um... what do you know
about John Kennington?
Well, he just got his golden handshake. Why?
Is he a homosexual?
I don´t know.
Why do you ask?
I think he might be involved
in this murder case that I´m on.
- Murder? I thought you were on Vice?
- It´s the murder of a rent boy.
Er, sorry, Jane, there´s nothing
I can tell you.
Mike, Mike. God, they´re just...
They´re young kids. 12, 13 years old.
They´re the same age as your kids,
for Christ´s sake.
- Do I have to spell it out for you?
- Yes, you do.
If you start digging the dirt on
John Kennington, it´ll be a waste of time.
He may no longer be a big fish but he sure
as hell has got lots of friends who are.
The whisper´ll get out, he´ll drop the word
and you won´t get near them.
And you won´t help the kids.
And the punters will still be there.
They´ll all still be there out on the street.
Back off this one, Jane.
Kennington´s out of the force.
Ignore it. That is the best...
the only advice I can give you.
Well, thank you for your advice.
Oh, incidentally... Er... Mike?
You know there´s that superintendency
up for grabs - AMIT.
Do you happen to know which area that is?
You´re going to become a player, are you?
- Good night.
- Night.
Can I just say something? Um...
Well, apologise, really.
I just wanted you to know
I didn´t really have much say in the matter
and er...
Um... I´m sorry. And...
I- I don´t know where I am.
I´m in some kind of limbo.
I can´t sleep!
My... My girlfriend...
I haven´t told her.
I´m too scared to have sex with her.
It´s just...
This whole thing, kind of, you know,
hanging over us.
Listen, anyone would feel like that.
What if I´ve got Aids?
I´m sorry. Sorry.
Shit. Sorry. Sorry.
Hey.
It´s all right.
- Listen, I think you should talk to someone.
- Yeah.
- I mean, someone who understands.
- Yeah.
- You should go with your girlfriend.
- OK.
I´ve got some contact numbers. I´ll give you
the numbers as soon as possible, OK?
Yeah. Thank you.
Thanks a lot.
I´ve got Parker-Jones in Room Two.
What?
He´s here?
- Whose bloody idea was that?
- Mine.
We found some kids that recognised
the property where we picked up Jackson.
- It´s owned by Parker-Jones.
- What?
Jackson´s been living in a house owned
by Parker-Jones. It´s all there. Full report.
- Who´s interviewing him?
- Haskons and Lillie.
- Oh, shit.
- As you weren´t here...
we couldn´t contact you.
I´ve just been trying to close the case.
No. I know what you´re doing, Bill.
And you´re just not good enough.
I did not want Parker-Jones brought in yet.
- Have you got a reason?
- Yeah. I´m not ready for him.
Why exactly have I been brought in?
Why wasn´t all this asked before?
I´ve been perfectly willing to co-operate.
Detective Chief Inspector.
The time is 18:30 and DCI Tennison
has just entered the interview room.
Mr Parker-Jones, could you tell me
about your relationship with Margaret Speel?
She is my fiancée.
Did you, in 1979,
run the Harrow Home For Boys in Manchester?
- Yes.
- And, in 1986...
- ...the Calloway Centre in Cardiff?
- Yes.
Do you know Anthony Field?
Yes.
- Jason Baldwin?
- Yes. They were both in my care.
Do you know a John Kennington?
Yes. Not well, but I have met him.
Will you tell me about one of your
employees - James Jackson?
I wouldn´t call it employed, exactly.
He does, on the odd occasión,
do some repairs for me.
Caretaking, that sort of thing.
How well do you know Mr Jackson?
I´ve already told you, I don´t know him
on a personal or social level.
He simply does the occasional
odd job for me, that´s all.
But he lives in one of your properties,
Mr Parker-Jones.
Yes. I have admitted this.
I pay Jackson a nominal amount and,
in return, he repairs the property.
I have no reason to know what he does
in his personal life.
I´m not even sure if he lives on
the property in a permanent basis,
as he told me he has an elderly mother he
takes care of and spends a lot of time with.
How many names are you known under?
I have two houses in the name of Edwards
and one in the name of Jones.
I have, on occasión, used both of them.
And why do you use different names
on the deeds of your properties?
I just do. There´s no law against it.
Would you like to tell me
about the two sexual assault charges -
one in Manchester and one in Cardiff?
Not really.
In both incidents
all the charges were dropped.
I see no reason to discuss them now.
Did John Kennington assist or advise you
in any way concerning these charges?
I don´t recall.
Have you ever attempted to get monies
from John Kennington? Extortion. Blackmail.
- Did you ever attempt to get monies?
- No. That´s ridiculous.
Are you aware that John Kennington
was bringing charges...
I would certainly not attempt
to extort monies...
from someone
who has freely donated to my centre.
I have presented a detailed list,
as requested,
of all those who give charitable donations
to the centre.
I presume this information
was passed on to you.
Did you call the emergency services
on the night of the 17th?
- I´m sorry?
- An ambulance.
Did you call an ambulance
on the night of the 17th?
No.
Would you please state
where you were on the night of the 17th
between the hours of 8:15 and 9:30?
I have already told you.
I never left the Advice Centre.
This is really becoming ludicrous.
Is it?
Are you aware that it is illegal
to display false credentials?
So would you tell me the names
of all the witnesses
that you say saw you at the Advice Centre
for the duration of the evening of the 17th?
Billy Matthews, David Driscoll,
Alan Thorpe, Kenny Lloyd and...
James Jackson.
I think I deserve a bottle of champagne
because...
Billy Matthews´ alibi is now withdrawn.
Billy was not at the Advice Centre
or anywhere near.
He was, in fact, in hospital,
taken there by ambulance on the night
of the 17th - and this is the best bit -
- from the Advice Centre.
- Coffees, please, love.
- Fletcher´s dead.
- Disco Driscoll, alibi withdrawn.
Kenny Lloyd, alibi withdrawn.
Just Jackson giving Parker-Jones an alibi
and vice versa.
The only other person is Alan Thorpe,
but he was drunk.
- OK, now, where´s Jackson?
- With Larry the Lamb. Room Three.
That´s a bottle of Moêt for Kathy.
And you two are paying
because of this fiasco.
Oh, yes!
Oh, bloody hell.
Who put those up?
What did Connie owe you the money for?
He needed some photographs.
He needed to get some new gear.
Well, that´s what he told me,
so I lent him the dough.
How much?
7:36, DCI Tennison´s just
entered the interview room.
200 quid. Then he disappears,
so I go out looking for him.
Did you go to Vernon´s flat looking for him?
Yeah, but in the afternoon.
I spoke to Vera, she was there.
And she told you what?
That Connie wasn´t there. I´ve told you
all this. I´ve said all this.
Did Edward Parker-Jones ask you
to say that you were at the Advice Centre?
No.
Why don´t you tell me about the money?
- Did you often lend Connie money?
- No.
He usually had enough. He was always
pretty flush. Sometimes I borrowed from him.
So when exactly did
you give him this 200 quid?
- I don´t remember, I´m sorry.
- Can´t remember.
Er, was Connie living in a house
in Camden Town?
Sometimes left his gear there but he´d not
actually lived... lived there for months.
Do you know where he was living
for the past couple of months?
No. I don´t know where he was living.
Where did you give him the money, then?
- Oh, yeah, at the Advice Centre.
- No, no.
Edward Parker-Jones said he hadn´t seen him
at the Advice Centre for months.
I don´t remember where I gave it to him.
I´m sorry. Really.
Just don´t remember.
So, how well do you know
Edward Parker-Jones?
I work for him. He pays me a few quid
to look after his property.
Did you ever try and extort money
out of a man called John Kennington?
Extortion. Know what that means? Blackmail.
Did you ever blackmail John Kennington?
No. I don´t know him.
So, on the night that Connie died, did you
discuss anything with Edward Parker-Jones?
Yeah.
The price of toilet paper.
I get it in bulk for him.
And after Connie died, did you discuss
anything with Edward Parker-Jones,
apart from the price of toilet paper?
- Like what?
- Well, look...
You stated that... What have we got here?
David Driscoll, Billy Matthews,
Alan Thorpe and Kenny Lloyd
all saw you at the Advice Centre
the night that Colin died. Is that correct?
- Yeah, that´s right.
- The same names as listed by Parker-Jones.
I´m asking you again. Did you or did you not
discuss it with Mr Parker-Jones?
Well, no. There was no reason to.
They were there and so was he.
So he´s boud to say the same lads as I say
because I was there.
See?
You´ll be charged with the attempted murder
of a police officer.
You also refused another officer entry
to the house in Camden Town
and physically attacked
another police officer.
You were holding a 14-year-old girl
against her will.
Do you want any more, Jimmy? We´ve got more.
I didn´t know they were coppers, I swear.
I mean, they just barged into the house.
And that girl is not gonna press charges cos
she begged me to give her a place to stay.
I didn´t know she was 14.
And that other thing, I thought that was Red.
That thick old drag queen.
I didn´t know that was a copper.
It´s just mistaken identity.
- Why did you want to kill her?
- I didn´t want to kill her.
No way. I just wanted to frighten her a bit.
Why?
Well, Vera told me she´d been talking
to the cops...
and all I wanted to do
was frighten her off.
Why? Why did you want to frighten
Rodney Allerton?
That´s Red.
Because I did.
I´m sorry, I´m really sorry.
It was all a mistake.
Oh, James, you must have had a reason.
No.
No, I didn´t have a reason.
That´s the God´s honest truth.
Well, you are going to go to prison
for a very long time.
For no reason at all.
My client´s very tired.
Perhaps we can continue this interview
in the morning.
Look forward to it.
After you.
He must have had letters, diaries.
He was selling his story to that woman.
What was her name?
Jessica Smithy.
I mean, what if Jessica Smithy
spoke to Martin Fletcher before Connie?
She was writing a piece about rent boys
plural, not just one rent boy.
What have we got here?
Yeah. Nice little... awayday assortment.
Look at this.
I want Forensic in here.
I want the whole house checked out
and I want it done tonight.
I think we should have another go
at our Vera. She has been staying there.
I´ll wait for Forensic, might be a while.
This is my case, Bill.
Don´t jump the gun again.
Your case. Yes, ma´am.
Right. I´ve got a couple of bits and pieces
on Edward Parker-Jones.
He owns a number
of bed and breakfasts/houses.
All registered
under the company name of Protega.
- Can you spell that, please?
- P-R-O-T-E-G-A.
He´s a registered charity.
He´s got a staff of four.
- All paid?
- All paid.
Glad to see you´re still with us.
DCI Tenison please contact reception
He receives loads of grants.
He gets one from Camden at 160,000.
The doctor attached to the Calloway Centre
in Cardiff - his widow, Joyce Ellis.
She´s 52, has two sons.
In 1987, was married to John Kennington.
As well as that he gets £110 per person
from local authorities.
Decided to change sides, have you?
Could DCI Tenison return to her office?
Thank you very much.
You have not one shred of evidence
against Parker-Jones
or his involvement in the death of Col...
Colin Jenkins. No, I haven´t got him
to admit his involvement.
But I know that he´s covering up
for Jackson.
And very possibly for
John Kennington as well.
Drop it.
Are you serious?
In 1979 and again in 1986, both
Edward Parker-Jones and John Kennington...
I´m fully aware of the cases you´re referring to.
You should have made whatever information
you had available to me. I´ve wasted...
Waste being the operative word,
Chief Inspector.
- You´re supposed to be investigating...
- The murder of Colin Jenkins.
If I discover evidence
that proves that Edward Parker-Jones...
- That is not the Colin Jenkins case.
...is unfit to be awarded massive grants
and is a possible paedophile.
Is this true?
Chief Inspector Tennison,
you give me no option but to warn you
that if you continue
to investigation persons...
No, just one person. Edward Parker-Jones.
...against specific instructions,
then disciplinary action will be taken.
You take it, sir,
and I will fight you every inch of the way.
I have been fobbed off with "stay clear
of this or that persons" because of,
and I quote, "repercussions
to this department".
Well, this department has blatantly attempted
to sabotage my investigations into a murder..
which has direct links to a paedophile ring,
one member of which, John Kennington,
was the subject
of a full-scale internal police inquiry.
- Kennington was reinstated.
- Six months later he was being blackmailed.
Uh! Case dismissed.
What happen? You all get cold feet?
Retire him? Pay him off?
And somewhere in the mess
a young boy dies.
Just calm down.
Look at it from our side.
- The investigation into John Kennington...
- Was a failure.
And to the tune of £1 ½m.
Next - Operation Contract.
Bloody fiasco that was.
How much did that set the government back?
I mean, you knew there was a leak.
Well, was it John Kennington?
Be very careful what you´re insinuating.
Look, I just want to find
the murderer of Colin Jenkins.
If that touches on Edward Parker-Jones
or anyone else, then so be it.
I take full responsibility
You can lay it all on my shoulders.
But I will not be a scapegoat.
If you take me off this case now,
I´m warning you, I won´t go quietly.
Don´t make threats,
Detective Chief Inspector.
I want to be put forward for superintendent.
Now, I fully expect to make an arrest
in the Colin Jenkins murder this weekend.
And, therefore, with the case closed,
there will be no further necessities
for any investigations into John Kennington.
Did James Jackson kill Connie?
Vera, he can´t hurt you.
He´s gonna be behind bars for a very long time.
Come on, you can tell me.
I don´t know.
Do you know a John Kennington?
Vera.
Vera, look at me.
You´ve got to help me.
Jackson was looking for Connie that night.
He said he owed him money.
Connie didn´t need to borrow money
from Jackson. He always used to have money.
- Did you know any of his clients?
- No. He was very secretive about them.
You give one kid a name,
next minute they´re offering themselves.
You think he was just gay, don´t you?
Why do you think we got on so well?
I don´t know.
Why don´t you tell me?
He was the same as me.
He´d go with gays...
but he liked straight men better.
He wanted money.
He needed a lot.
For the operation.
They do the best in Rio.
He would have had to have paid for it.
There´s no way the NHS would give him
the operation. He was too young.
It´s always been my dream.
So Connie needed a lot of money.
Say, what, 10-15,000 quid?
Where was he gonna get that from?
Connie was capable of anything.
Like blackmail?
Yes.
I think he got scared off.
He was getting a bit desperate.
He´d lost a lot of his big money clients.
He was too old for them.
Kept knocking a few years off his age,
but they knew.
Do you know Jessica Smithy?
So you know that Connie
was selling his story to the papers?
But I think, you know, she kept
stringing him along, promising big money.
He used to brag about it.
But she wanted evidence -
you know, names, photographs.
Photographs!
Did James Jackson know about this?
Well, he found out.
Connie had a sort of a file, you know,
to show this reporter.
He found out.
Martin Fletcher stole some things
from Jackson.
- Oh.
- And gave them to Connie.
- That´s why Jackson was looking for Connie.
- Oh, right.
But not just to get these things back.
Because he knew that if Connie was selling
his story to the papers, he´d be in it too.
Connie had been one his boys, you see,
early on.
What, you mean it was Jackson
who got Connie on the game?
- Yes.
- Oh.
But he got him so young.
I mean, he was only ten years old
when Jackson found him.
Did you see what Martin got from Jackson,
the thing he eventually gave to Connie?
No, no, I never, I never saw it.
I mean, he told me. But it was... pictures.
Photographs. Maybe letters. I don´t know.
But I never saw
what Martin nicked from Jackson.
But that´s why Martin got beaten up,
because Jackson wanted the stuff back.
So, Connie had told you about this stuff
that Martin had got from Jackson.
And he told you that he was gonna use it,
sell it to the papers.
Did he tell you
who he was going to blackmail with it?
No, no. But he was kind of excited,
you know.
He was very pleased with himself.
Said he was going to get the money
for his operation. He was very certain.
Thank you, Vera.
All right, you can go now.
- Hello, Margaret. How are you?
- I intend to report you.
Get you blacklisted from every council and
government-run scheme that you´ve abused.
- What do you mean?
- I trusted you.
I may even have helped you, that´s what´s
worst. Worse than the lies you´ve told me.
- Who´s been talking to you?
- Don´t touch me.
- Come in and let´s just talk this through.
- She knows everything about you.
And about John Kennington.
Before I´ve finished, you´ll go to prison.
You don´t know what you´re talking about.
This is from that Inspector Tennison, yes?
You don´t understand, Margaret.
- Yes, I do.
- Shut up!
Now just keep calm.
Keep calm. Let me explain.
Get out of here.
Don´t you touch him! Get off him!
Get out. This place is closed. Get out now!
You bastard! You bastard!
That´s yours. That´s your doing!
You! You bastard!
You bastard! That´s you!
Bastard. You bastard!
Get out!
Mrs Kennington? Edward Parker-Jones.
Can I speak to John, please?
You bastard!
So you were told by Martin Fletcher
where Connie was?
You then went to Vernon Reynolds´ flat,
didn´t you?
I didn´t.
I´ve admitted I was looking for Connie,
but I wasn´t the only one.
Oh, who else? Who else was looking
for Connie the night that he was murdered?
Come on, Jimmy.
It´s just five, ten minutes´ walk
from the Advice Centre and back.
I never killed him. I couldn´t have.
But you had to silence him, didn´t you, eh?
He´s was going to tell
about the way you kidnap underage kids.
They were up at the top of the house.
We´ve seen them. The knives,
the chains, the whips, you bastard.
So did you torture kids up there?
We have, to date, 15 different blood samples
taken from the walls, bed linen, floorboards.
What were you doing to those children?
Mr Jackson, I really would try to be
as co-operative as possible.
You know, these charges against you
are very serious.
Look... I did go to the centre, right?
I told Parker-Jones
I couldn´t find him... right?
Look... Martin Fletcher took my stuff from...
What stuff?
Stuff. Things. Photographs.
And I wanted them back, right?
- Were you in these photographs?
- Some of them.
Connie nicked them. He got Martin to get them
for him from Camden, right? Are you with me?
Who else was in the photographs?
- I can´t remember.
- Can´t remember?
You almost killed a boy for them.
You can´t remember?
Come on, who else was in the photographs?
Was Edward Parker-Jones
in these photographs?
No.
How about John Kennington?
Was he in the photographs?
Just kids.
Blokes dressed up, bit of porno, that´s all.
Anyway, it gets to about eight, a bit after,
and I tell Parker-Jones I can´t find Connie
and he says get Martin Fletcher,
he´d know where he was.
So I did. Ask Martin Fletcher.
He´ll tell you.
Martin Fletcher is dead, Jimmy.
So, Edward Parker-Jones
was looking for these photographs.
Well, why? If he wasn´t in them,
why was he looking for them?
I don´t know.
All I know is he wanted them. So did I.
Yeah, but you were in the photographs.
Are you sure that Edward Parker-Jones
wasn´t in these photographs?
No. I don´t have any pictures of him.
Was John Kennington in the photographs?
No. I´ve told you before,
I don´t even know that bloke.
They were just photographs of you
and you wanted them so desperately
that you were prepared to kill for them.
Look... when that fire started,
I was on the other side of Waterloo Bridge.
Who else was at the Advice Centre?
I was only there two minutes, no more.
Then I come out.
Just two minutes? You sure about that?
Who else did you talk to apart from
Edward Parker-Jones? Anyone else?
Yeah.
Vera Reynolds.
Vera Reynolds.
Are you all right?
He shot himself, not me.
You were here yesterday, weren´t you?
Yes. Do you want me to leave?
But then you´d only want to come back.
So... ask whatever you want
and get it over with.
I was in the front bedroom.
We sleep in separate rooms.
There was a phone call.
I put it through to John´s study.
About half an hour later, I heard the...
Well, I didn´t know what it was.
To be honest, I thought it was the plumbing.
It´s been making extraordinary noises.
Of course, it wasn´t.
John had shot himself.
Do you know who the call was from?
Oh, yes, I know who it was from.
It was er...
...Edward Parker-Jones.
At least this saves me getting a divorce.
There have been obstacles in the way
for almost a year.
Yes, I know about the investigations.
Oh, do you?
Mrs Kennington, you used to be a doctor,
didn´t you?
Mm.
- Do you still practise?
- No.
My first husband died. We worked together.
Or in the same practice.
In Cardiff.
Yes, in... in Cardiff.
Why do you want to know about
my husband´s practice?
While you were in Cardiff,
was Edward Parker-Jones running the um...
The Calloway Centre.
Why are you asking me these questions?
Did you examine a boy, a young boy,
called Jason Baldwin?
- It was a sexual assault charge.
- Which was subsequently dropped.
No, my husband examined him.
Oh, my God.
You think I had something to do with that?
My husband was critically ill.
He was very sick. I had...
I had two small children.
And he had... cancer.
I only remember because...
because he died...
and then there was this investigation
about this boy.
But there was so much confusión.
Whether his reports were stolen
or just mislaid, I really don´t know.
My first husband was a...
...very decent human being.
Do you know if any young boys
were ever brought here?
Do I know if young boys
were ever brought here?
I mean, while you were away.
There´s one boy in particular
that I´m interested in.
His name was Connie.
Colin Jenkins.
Do you recognise him?
Mrs Kennington,
would you please look at the photograph?
At least I was able to protect my own sons.
Er, let me know when you want to see
Jessica Smithy. She´s just arrived.
Was it right you wanted Vernon Reynolds
bringing back in? We just released him.
Yes. Oh, and watch Alice in Wonderland.
Remember she´s a journalist.
- Stick her in one of the interview rooms.
- Right.
Yes, hello, could I speak to Dr Gordon,
please? It´s Jane Tennison.
Dr Gordon, I´m sorry to disturb you at home.
I wanted to talk to you as soon as possible.
No, no, no. No, it´s just that...
I would like to arrange
a termination, please.
Yes, I am aware that it´s
a very big decisión, but I...
Yes, I obviously have given it
a great deal of thought.
I want an abortion.
Yes, I know.
Right.
I´ll call you next week
to arrange a time and a date.
OK. Goodbye.
Bill, would you just give me a moment or two
on my own?
Certainly.
- Choose them yourself, do you?
- Er, no, my girlfriend does.
I´d get rid of her if I were you.
It´s shit!
And you lied to me. You never at any time
said that you were near that Advice Centre.
- Why, Vernon?
- You´ve always called me Vera.
Oh, stop playing games with me.
Did you or did you not,
on the night that Connie died, see Jackson?
Yes.
And what time did you get
to the Advice Centre?
A- A-About 8:30.
8:30.
- Where was Connie?
- In the flat.
- Alone?
- Yes.
Well... your friend Red is now
in trouble, isn´t he?
Because he swore, on oath,
that you were at your friend´s studio at...
6:30 it was, yes. He never notices the time.
Then I went to the club, just as he said.
When you left your flat, was Connie there?
Suspect nodded his head.
Was he alone?
Suspect shook his head.
Well, who was with Connie
when you left your flat at 6:30?
A journalist.
I tried.
I told you. I gave you all the clues.
It was me who was at the Advice Centre.
I even said Parker-Jones´s name.
It was me who told you about Jackson,
me who told you about the press.
I went back to the flat because
I´d forgotten um...
...a sequined choker.
Connie was still there.
And he was showing her my album.
She was looking at my photographs.
You don´t understand, do you?
There were some loose pictures
of me before...
Before.
With my mum and my dad.
Private pictures, no show business ones.
Just my mum and my dad and my brother.
I´d had enough.
I don´t ever see them,
so the pictures are very special to me.
After all I´d done for him,
he was selling me too.
I didn´t want to make a drama,
not in front of the press woman.
So I just called him out of the room.
Said I wanted to talk to him.
He swore
he wasn´t letting her have a single picture.
She left a few minutes later.
I went in to check my album. He lied.
There were a lot missing.
So... I confronted him but...
...he swore he hadn´t given her anything,
said she must´ve stolen them,
but he was such a liar.
And er...
I got hysterical and er... I hit him.
With an ashtray, I think.
He fell down.
I didn´t mean to hurt him.
I helped him to the sofa.
He gave me one of his smiles.
He had such a sweet smile.
He closed his eyes.
I couldn´t feel a pulse and he was...
he was dead.
Did you call an ambulance?
My telephone´s not working.
I told Mr Parker-Jones. He said...
- What? What did he say?
- He said he would take care of everything.
- Did he?
- I don´t know.
I was put in prison
when I was not that much older than Connie.
That´s what I´m scared of.
Inside, they´re all Jacksons.
I was raped every night.
That´s what I´ve been so scared of.
I wanted to tell you but I was just so scared.
I need to go to...
I need to go to the toilet.
We are terminating this interview at... 3:45
in Interview Room Two.
Mr Vernon Reynolds needs to use the toilet.
Could you take him to the toilet, please?
Can´t you take me to the ladies?
You just pretended to like me.
Come on, love!
Oh, hello.
- Who´s in there?
- Vernon Reynolds.
He´s just admitted
to smacking Colin Jenkins.
Just finished questioning him.
So it wasn´t Jackson after all?
Vernon´s cut his wrists.
I need to call an ambulance.
All right. Come on.
He´s cut his wrists!
Vera. Listen to me.
- I´m sorry. I´m sorry.
- Hold on, Vera. Hold on.
- I´m sorry, I´m sorry. Sorry. I´m sorry.
- It´s all right.
She´s losing a lot of blood. Hurry up!
- I´m sorry. I´m sorry.
- Listen.
Listen. You didn´t kill Connie.
She died in the fire.
15- minute delay on the ambulance call-out.
Get a car.
Get one for me too.
He died in the fire.
It was the fire that did it.
I´ve been here since half-past two.
I want to go to the ladies.
- You have no right to waste my time.
- I have every right.
And I will keep you here as long as I wish.
You have lied, you have withheld
vital evidence and you, Miss Smithy...
...have wasted my time.
You want the ladies? Come with me.
I only made two tapes, I swear before God.
Just two tapes.
I know I should have told you
about me being at the flat.
Did you take anything from his flat?
- Did you?
- Yes.
They were just some snapshots. Nobody
famous. Just a few black-and-white photos.
Apart from the photographs that you took,
did Connie give you anything?
Nothing. Nothing.
Just some story about being picked up when
he was 10 or 11. I think he made that up.
Come with me.
- I tried to contact you, you know I did.
- Oh, stop with the Doris Day act.
- It´s getting on my nerves.
- Your car´s ready.
Get Kathy
to get in touch with emergency services.
Check if there was a 15- minute delay
on the night of the 17th. Quick as you can.
Right, Miss Smithy,
tell me about Martin Fletcher.
He was the first boy I approached.
He introduced me to Connie.
It became obvious
that Connie would make a better story.
- We were worried Martin was too young.
- Martin Fletcher is dead.
Did you know that?
Right, you drop Martin Fletcher
and you offer Connie money.
Did you give him the money
in Vernon Reynolds´ flat?
Yes. He put it in his pocket. He said
it wasn´t enough. He said he wanted more.
All right. And what happened then?
I said I couldn´t give him any more,
not until I at least saw what he had to offer.
Did he give you anything?
Any pictures, any names? Anything?
No.
What happened next?
He left the room for a minute.
And there was this album
on the coffee table.
Vera Reynolds´ album.
Yes?
They were just photos of a family.
And a couple of somebody in drag.
They were no use. They meant nothing.
You´re wrong, Miss Smithy.
They meant a great deal to someone.
Enough to make him pick up a heavy ashtray
and hit Connie over the head with it.
You have a great deal to answer for.
Will you take Miss Smithy and bring her back
with Vernon Reynolds´ photographs?
- Are you going to charge me with anything?
- We´ll see about that.
Emergency services have said
there was a 15- minute delay that night
and all callers were informed
that that was the case.
I´ve got him. And this time
I´m ready for him. Let´s go.
I hope you´re satisfied.
You´ve emptied the place.
Mr Parker-Jones, I am arresting you
on suspición of involvement
in the murder of Colin Jenkins.
You do not have to say anything...
but if you wish to, what you say
may be used in evidence.
You all set?
I think so.
You´d better nail him.
I intend to.
<i>I told you I had names.
Very important people. High-up people</i>
<i>Very important people, because if they
found out I was doing this, they´d kill me.</i>
<i>Very important people.
High-up people. Very important people.</i>
Good luck, guv.
Mr Parker-Jones, you have stated that
on the evening of the 17th,
you were at the Advice Centre, Soho,
is that correct?
Yes.
Would you please tell me
who else was present that evening?
- Billy Matthews...
- Statement withdrawn.
Matthews denies being at the centre.
- David Driscoll?
- Statement withdrawn.
Driscoll denies being at the centre.
- Alan Thorpe.
- Alan Thorpe says that he was at the centre
but that he was not only intoxicated
but also suffering from substance abuse
and was, in his own words, unable to remember
whether he was there himself.
James Jackson.
Mr Jackson has made a statement,
contradicting an earlier statement.
He now says, under caution,
that he was at the centre,
but for no more than two or three minutes.
Do you have any other alibi witnesses
you wish to have recorded at this time?
My client will answer.
I... realise I have been very foolish.
I can only apologise and say I was in some
way trying to protect Vernon Reynolds.
Vernon was at the centre on the 17th.
Did you speak to Vernon Reynolds?
No comment.
Did Vernon Reynolds
ask you to call an ambulance?
No comment.
Mr Parker-Jones, we are
in the possessión of a tape recording.
It´s a phone call made to the emergency
services on the evening of the 17th.
It would be very simple for us to match
the voice on the tape with yours, so...
...did you or did you not call an ambulance
on the evening of the 17th?
Yes, I did call an ambulance.
Vernon was in a dreadful state.
Er, he said that Colin Jenkins and he
had argued
and that Colin needed a doctor.
I placed a call with the emergency services.
And what did the emergency
services tell you?
That the ambulance was on its way.
Anything else?
No, I don´t think so.
Why didn´t you leave your name?
Well, because the Advice Centre has had,
on occasión, to place emergency calls
and then when the ambulance arrives...
Did the emergency services tell you
that there would be a 15- minute delay?
I don´t remember.
Would you agree that Vernon Reynolds´ flat
is about a two-minute walk
from the Advice Centre?
- Yes.
- So, if you had been informed of a delay...
I was unaware of any delays.
Why didn´t you call a doctor?
Why didn´t you make that
short journey yourself?
Well, because
I couldn´t leave the centre unattended.
And at no point did Vernon make it clear
that it was an emergency.
I was asked to phone an ambulance.
Which I did.
I admit I lied to you about that,
but I was just trying to prevent
Vernon Reynolds from getting into trouble.
Do you have any further questions
you wish to put to my client?
Yes, I do.
Mr Parker-Jones,
you´ve apologised for lying.
You lied about the four witnesses
you said saw you at the Advice Centre
on the evening of the 17th.
Now, one of those witnesses
was Billy Matthews. Is that correct?
Yes, but you must understand that on any
given evening, there could be 20-25 boys...
Yes, but you were most specific
about Billy Matthews.
The reason you said you recalled him
was because he was ill.
Yes.
It transpires Billy Matthews
was not at the Advice Centre that night.
He was in Charing Cross Hospital.
I´m sorry, I...
I just must have confused the evening.
Really?
Even though you called an ambulance for him?
That would have been
on the evening of the 16th.
On that occasión, you did leave your name.
And on that occasión, you were informed
that there would be a 15- minute delay.
Is that not correct?
It´s possible.
Oh, it´s possible?
It´s also possible that the following evening
when you called an ambulance,
you would already know
that there was a 15- minute delay.
Giving you time to leave the Advice Centre
and go to Vera´s flat.
Did you? Did you go to
Vernon Reynolds´ flat?
No. I did not.
Mr Parker-Jones, are you aware
of the existence of certain photographs
belonging to Mr James Jackson?
No comment.
And that in these photographs you are
pictured with the deceased, Colin Jenkins?
No comment.
And that you are photographed
in various poses with other juveniles?
And that these photographs were taken
from your house in Camden?
No comment.
Oh, I think that you knew of the existence
of these photographs.
- You knew Connie Jenkins was selling them.
- No comment.
So you had James Jackson
searching all over London,
desperate to track them down,
desperate to track Connie down.
- But you couldn´t find him, could you?
- No comment.
And then Vera came to you,
as you said, in a dreadful state.
Saying that the very person
you were looking for...
was not only in her flat...
but was also unconscious,
alone and with those photographs.
- No comment.
- So you said you´d arrange everything.
You said that you´d even call an ambulance.
No comment?
No comment again, Mr Parker-Jones?
You´ve already admitted
that you were aware of the delays.
You used that 15 minutes, didn´t you?
You ran from the Advice Centre,
you went to Vera´s flat.
Connie wasn´t dead, was he?
He was still alive. Just semiconscious.
So you made sure he would never be able
to tell anyone about you,
you and your friends, Mr Parker-Jones.
It was so easy. He couldn´t do anything -
couldn´t fight back, couldn´t stop you -
as you set light to him,
you left him to burn to death.
No comment.
Good night, Inspector Tennison.
Which is the way out?
Without a witness who actually saw person
or persons unknown set alight to that flat,
you´ll never have a case.
So... this blown my chances
for superintendent?
Oh, no. No, you´ll get it.
No strings.
Jessica Smithy´s back.
Still looking for a scoop, Miss Smithy?
I´m paid to expose the truth. It´s my job.
Bit like yours.
No, your job isn´t anything like mine.
But it is criminal that a man
like Edward Parker-Jones...
is allowed to gain access
to young children...
and all with the blessing
of the social services.
- Files you asked for, guv.
- Thank you very much.
Yeah.
Young boy called him...
"the Keeper of Souls".
It was his nickname.
Good headline, isn´t it?
Nice turn of phrase
for a sick pervert like him.
Excuse me.
Is Parker-Jones going to be charged?
