"And the Raven,
never flitting, still is sitting,
still is sitting on the pallid bust of Pallas
just above my chamber door.
And his eyes have all the seeming
of a demon's that is dreaming.
And the lamplight o'er him streaming
throws his shadow on the floor.
And my soul from out that shadow
that lies floating on the floor
shall be lifted never more."
Pretty good, huh? OK. I want you to
read the "Legend of Sleepy Hollow".
You're gonna like it.
It's about a schoolteacher who
gets chased by a headless demon.
Hi.
Can teachers be expelled
for kissing in the hallway?
- They get fired.
- Thank God it's Friday!
You sound like one of my students.
Why don't you carry my books?
I hope you haven't made
any plans for this afternoon.
Ooh! Where are we going?
It's a surprise.
You OK?
What's wrong?
I don't know.
Didn't use to bother me.
Enjoy the ride folks?
That's it, take it away.
- Do you want to come in?
- Better not.
- Are you alright?
- I'm OK.
I had a wonderful time.
Are you sure you don't want to come
in? You could spend the night here.
Better not.
Some things
are worth waiting for.
My books!
Johnny, wait!
I'm so crazy about you.
I'm going to marry you, you know?
You'd better.
- Drive carefully.
- I will.
Where's intensive care?
Johnny.
Johnny don't leave me please.
Johnny you're going to get better.
I know you are.
Can you hear me?
We're gonna get married,
Johnny don't leave me.
Hello John. My name's Weizak.
I'm Dr Sam Weizak.
I'm the director of this clinic.
You've been our guest here for a while.
Guest? Funny way of putting it.
How do you feel?
My throat hurts.
Try a bit of water. Come.
Hey, slow down.
Not so fast, slow down.
You've been involved in a terrible
traffic accident. Do you remember?
Am I OK?
Well... You've been
smashed up pretty badly.
What is it?
No bandages.
How come?
Your parents are here.
They're right next door.
I'm going to bring them in now.
Is that OK?
Sure.
Do come in.
- Hi, Mom. Dad.
- John.
Johnny, Johnny...
It's a miracle, John.
I know.
I was lucky. Look.
Not a scratch.
The Lord has delivered you
from your trance.
Remember what we discussed,
Mrs Smith, please.
What's she talking about?
You've been in a coma,
Johnny, not a trance.
Coma? For how long?
We're just glad to have you back, son.
That's all that matters.
How long? Dad, how long?
Five years.
Five long years John.
Lost for five years.
Now reborn unto me.
Five... years?
What about Sarah?
Just put her from your thoughts John.
She's turned her back on you.
She cleaves now onto another man,
her husband.
Husband!
Amy!
Amy! Amy!
Amy is my daughter's name.
Your daughter's screaming.
The house is burning.
Your daughter's in the house.
It's not too late. Amy. Amy!
Your daughter's screaming!
Amy's screaming. It's not too late.
Your daughter's screaming. Hurry up!
The first order of business is
getting your body back into shape.
Although you've been
exercised regularly, the, uh--
ligaments have shortened
a little during the coma.
Am I going to have
to live in a wheelchair?
Not permanently. And not for very long.
Not if I can help it.
I, uh--
I won't deceive you John.
Your therapy will be long
and painful. But you will walk.
Thank you.
The wolf is loose.
John, John. Are you alright?
No match for them.
Horses, fire.
The boy is safe.
The boy is safe.
John!
John!
Are you alright? Hmm?
Tell me...
what about the boy?
You keep saying the boy is safe.
The boy is safe. What boy?
You. You're the boy.
I... am the boy?
She saved you. She's alive Sam.
Who?
Your mother.
No, that's not possible, John.
She survived.
John, my mother is dead.
She's alive. I know her name.
I know where she lives.
But that is not possible John.
How could you know that? How?
I'm scared Sam.
What's happening to me?
Hello.
Hello! May I speak to?
Yes.
Is Johanna there please?
One moment.
Hello! Hello, who is it please?
Well, you are either in possession
of a very new human ability...
...or a very old one.
Yes. Oh, over here will be fine.
Thank you.
Try to get you back
on your feet in a day or two.
That should help you get some
of your strength back.
What's on your mind, Sam?
You were right John,
about my mother.
I got the number
from information.
There it was,
right in the phone book.
Did you talk to her?
No, I didn't. I um--
She came to the phone,
but I just couldn't talk to her.
I hung up.
Why?
Why?
Because it wasn't meant to be.
It wasn't meant to be.
Chug, chug, chug!
Come on easy now. Keep it moving.
Keep it moving. Come on.
Weight down, knees up. Keep it
moving. Keep it moving. Chug. Chug.
That's it.
That's it? After all I've done.
That's what I get. Eight lousy steps?
I counted ten.
I'd really like to see you
do some serious chugging.
I'm gonna take a run around
the building. You stay here?
OK.
- Keep chugging?
- OK.
See you when I get back.
Johnny.
They told me you were outside.
I am.
I didn't know
if I should come or not.
It's alright.
You got your hair cut.
Oh, yeah, a long time ago.
You lost weight.
Call it coma diet.
Lose weight while you sleep.
I guess you know I got married.
I heard that.
I think you'd like him.
You still teach?
Mmm. Mmm.
Mothering's a full time job.
Kids too. I didn't know that.
I'm sorry. Thought your father
would have told you.
He's a wonderful little boy.
His name is Denny.
How old is he?
Ten months.
Glad for you.
Please don't look at me like that.
What am I gonna do? For you,
five years have come and gone.
For me, it's just about the next day.
My feelings haven't changed yet.
Oh, Johnny!
Why did it have to happen like this?
Bad luck.
I never should have
let you go that night.
It was my idea, remember?
Jerk!
Everybody's talking about you.
You're the talk of the town.
'Cos I got my head bashed in.
And I'm still here to talk about it?
Because you have the power
of second sight. Is it true Johnny?
The papers won't let up about it.
I keep thinking about a line from a book.
It's "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow".
The last thing I gave my class to read
before the accident.
Ichabod Crane disappears.
The line goes
"As he was a bachelor
and in nobody's debt,
nobody troubled their head
about him, anymore".
Is that what you're afraid of?
That's what I want.
I don't approve.
The press has been hounding me since
I woke up. I wanna get it over with.
Once you set something
like this in motion,
it seems to me
you'll never know where it'll lead.
It's already in motion.
Just wanna stop it.
They went over there and put it out.
And that's all there is.
Clement Dardis WJGE-TV.
What happened to the little girl?
I understand she's fine.
Well... Would you call this
a psychic experience?
No. I would not.
Ever had one of these
experiences before?
No.
How about a demonstration, John?
A what?
A demonstration.
Um, got any predictions?
You think Greg Stillson's
gonna unseat Senator Proctor?
Who?
Greg Stillson.
Er, thank you sir. No more.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. How
about it John? How about the election?
I don't even know
who you're talking about?
Why, you didn't know
anything about this nurse?
That was different...
Well I...
I touched her hand.
Oh, right! Oh, right!
Touch my hand.
Hey John, touch my hand.
So is my house on fire, John?
Do you want me to stop this?
Tell you about your house.
What do you want to know?
Do you wanna know the future?
Do you wanna know if you're gonna'
die? Is that it? You're gonna die.
I'm gonna die. You wanna know
if you're gonna die tomorrow?
Is that right? You wanna know
why your sister killed herself?
Right, we're done, let go.
It's not alright.
It's OK.
It's not OK.
OK.
I could tell you now.
I'm not gonna talk about that.
Let go of me, you fucking freak.
Stop it. Please stop it.
It's real important.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
You heard him.
Dr Danvers, call 1522.
Dr Danvers, call 1522.
Oh, yes nurse.
Notify Dr Morton that I'm out here.
She knows you're coming.
- Doctor, thanks for bringing the boy.
- That's alright.
Hello.
It's Johnny, mom.
Oh! Johnny.
Leave your boots
outside the door, dear.
Don't go tracking snow
all over the house.
I won't.
You're a good boy.
You're wasting your time here, sheriff.
You know that. Don't you?
Well, you never know Frank.
Worth a try.
Mr Smith?
Yeah, yeah. I'm Herb Smith.
George Bannerman. How do you do?
Castle Rock. May I come in?
Yeah, yeah. Sure, come in.
It's a little nippy out there.
- That's a nice tree you got there.
- Thanks.
May I do something for you, sheriff?
Well actually, if this is your son,
I came to see him. Are you John?
Sheriff Bannerman.
Castle Rock.
Well, I guess I've come to you
with what you'd call a proposal, John.
It has to do with these murders we've
been having. The Castle Rock killer.
- I'm sure you've heard of him.
- Sure.
I don't know whether
it's true or not, John,
about these
psychic powers of yours.
But if it is true, John.
I could use your help.
John, maybe
you should give him a...
Take a minute to think about it.
But bear in mind,
some decent young women
from homes like this,
met with terrible deaths.
Now, I'm at my wits' end.
I've exhausted about all conventional
methods of approach to this situation.
I've come up with nothing.
I feel you can help me, John.
You made a mistake.
Mmm...
I was sorry to hear about your
mother's death, John. Mr. Smith.
I understand she was
a good woman. Christian woman.
I'm not a religious man myself,
I'm sorry to say. But I will say this.
If God has seen fit to bless you
with this gift, you should use it.
Bless me?
You know what God did for me?
He threw an
eighteen-wheel truck at me.
Bounced me into nowhere
for five years.
When I woke up my girl was gone.
My job was gone.
My legs are just about useless.
Bless me?
God's been a real sport to me.
Alright John. If you change your mind,
you know where I am...
Merry Christmas to you.
Well?
Well what?
See. What did I tell you?
That murder she was talking about.
God-awful things.
Went on all during the time
you were in a coma.
Just don't have the knack for tinsel.
It was your mother who always
kept the tree looking good...
I wish to God she were here now, so
she could talk to you about this thing.
I'm not much help to you, am I?
Sure you are.
You, uh, want to talk about it?
Not that much to say.
It don't bring you much happiness,
does it, son?
When it happens...
when the spells come,
it feels like--
I don't know.
It feels like
I'm dying... inside.
No snow.
It should snow for Christmas.
Hi. I brought you a visitor.
I didn't know you were coming.
I wasn't sure myself.
I'm glad. If I'd known you were
coming, I'd have cleaned up.
You look wonderful.
You lost the crutches I see.
Yeah. I still got the limp.
Is your father home?
No. He won't be back till later.
Is that who I think it is?
His Majesty.
Danny.
Denny. Say Hi.
Denny.
It's cold. Come on in.
He's asleep.
Last time we were alone together,
you said some things
were worth waiting for.
Well, haven't we waited long enough?
Dad's been carrying on
with Charlene McKenzie.
Ever since her husband died,
she's got him over there
building one thing or another.
But if you ask me it's the company
she wants
more than the bookcases.
I heard that.
Hup. Hup.
That's a boy.
There you are young fella'.
I made that for John,
the night he was born.
It's an excellent chair.
So what have you two
been up to all day?
Making bookcases.
Sit down, dinner's ready.
Boy, that smells good. I'm starved.
I hope you like it.
I bet he will. He's fed up
with my cuisine.
For what we are about to receive may
the Lord make us truly grateful. Amen.
You know it feels good to have
a family around this table again.
Am I going to see you again?
Not like today.
Go inside you're freezing.
It, it doesn't have to.
Don't say it. Don't say it Johnny.
I'll just say goodnight.
...Joan of Arc.
But his wife said before today...
Well, guess I'll hit the hay.
I'm gonna watch some TV.
The Castle Rock killer's
in the news again.
Good night, son.
Despite the continuing
efforts on the part of police,
the killer is still at large and is likely
to remain so for some time.
We spoke to Sheriff George
Bannerman outside
the Castle County courthouse
earlier today.
We have no new leads at this time.
However, there is always the hope
that some citizen,
perhaps in the audience right now,
might have some information
that would be very helpful.
My line is always open.
And I would welcome any help
we can possibly get.
That's really all I have to say
at this time. Thank you.
Thus far, nine separate murders
have been attributed
to the Castle Rock killer,
dating back almost
three and a half years.
The most recent victim of this
shocking wave of rape murders
was 15 year old Debbie Lindeman.
A sophomore
at Castle Rock high school.
Her partially clad body was
found just one month ago today
in the rock lane boat yard.
As in the other Castle Rock killings,
cause of death was determined
by the coroner's office
to be multiple stab wounds.
Next on News Eight,
sports and weather with Ron.
After this important message.
I'm gonna help him.
What did you say, son?
The sheriff that came here...
Bannerman.
I'm going to help him.
We think the killer hid
around the corner,
just out the end of the tunnel there.
And when the poor girl came through,
the bastard was waiting for her.
Tell the kids
not to come through here. Dammit.
You know they like to use this
as a short cut to school.
He stood right here.
Found a lot of cigarette butts, same
brand. Eight or nine butts here.
This help you any?
I don't know. Have you got something
he might have touched or worn?
Frank, give me that package.
It's the only real evidence we have.
Found it in one
of the bushes back there.
Same brand as the butts
we found in the ground. Here.
Nothing.
I thought I might
have felt something. But I...
It's OK. It's OK.
Can't say we didn't try. Huh?
Dispatch to Sheriff Bannerman.
Yeah, this is Bannerman.
We got another body here, sheriff.
Oh. Dammit!
What's the word George?
What's the word on the stabbings.
Sheriff?
What's the word on
the Castle Rock Killer?
That's that psychic Smith,
isn't it?
Stand back please. Give us a break.
We're trying to do a job.
Anyone know who she is? Dodd?
Yeah I know this girl.
Her name is Alma Frechette.
She works at the Coffee Pot café
across the way there.
Your idea George
to have a psychic with qualifications?
Dodd, get these people out of here.
Move 'em back. Move the
people back. Knock it off -
those cameras now.
No more cameras. No more.
- Dodd!
- Yeah.
- Nobody comes up here.
- You got it, sheriff.
You wanna try?
Hey Alma. Hi.
Hi. What are you doing up there?
Waiting for you.
How about a little smile?
She knows him.
She knows him.
Why should
I waste a smile on you?
You want to see something.
It's the God damndest thing.
What?
Come up here to the gazebo.
She knows him. Not scared.
She knows him.
Alright.
Well, what did you want to show me?
Gazebo! You like that word, Alma?
Come here, look at this.
Jesus. Will you let go of me?
Is this your idea of a joke?
No joke!
Wait!
You alright? Dodd give me a hand.
I saw him. I was there. I saw him.
I stood there. I saw his face.
Who?
I stood there and
watched him kill that girl. Dodd!
Wait a minute.
What are you saying?
I did nothing. I stood there
and watched him kill that girl.
Who are you talking about?
Dodd.
I stood there, I did nothing.
Dodd! Dodd get up here.
He just took off in your car sheriff.
I saw his face. I saw his face.
I want you to stay there.
Sheriff.
I thought
I told you to stay by the car.
Who's there?
It's Sheriff Bannerman.
Wanna talk to your son, Mrs Dodd.
He isn't here.
Well, his patrol car's out here.
Well his car's here. But he isn't.
He's here. I saw him in the window.
I'm tellin you he isn't home.
- I'm coming in, Mrs Dodd.
- No!
You leave my boy alone.
You knew.
Didn't you?
You knew.
You...
You're a devil...
sent from hell!
Frank.
Hello, John.
May I come in?
How did you find me? My father?
Stopped off to see him. And he
told me you moved to a new town.
He's worried about you. And so am I.
There's nothing to worry about. I'm
taking care of myself. It's about time.
I'm still your doctor John.
You're still under my care.
We have to stay in touch.
How's the, uh--
All healed up?
The bullet went right through me.
It's nothing.
Good. Nice place you have here.
It's home.
Those headaches are getting worse.
Aren't they?
Three or four times a day sometimes.
I brought you some new medication.
No. No more pills.
Takes time to recover. The healing
process is slow. I told you many times.
I'm not getting better.
I'm getting worse. Isn't that right?
Alright.
Now listen. In the last few
months I've done some research
into the area
of psychic phenomena.
Several cases such as yours
have been documented -
I was surprised to discover.
And the pattern is always the same.
As the spells, the visions grow stronger
and more powerful,
so the body weakens.
But I don't need any research
or documentation
to see that this thing is sucking
the life out of you.
One look at you can tell me that.
You mean I'm gonna die? How long?
I think we can arrest the process.
Reverse it even.
How do you do that?
Come back with me.
Where?
To the clinic of course.
No. Absolutely no.
John please! You must.
Why? So you can study me.
No. So I can protect you. You need to
be in a controlled environment, John.
I wanna show you something.
Come with me.
The cards and letters
just keep pouring in.
What is all this?
It's people. Lost dogs,
lost children, lost lives.
You haven't opened them.
I don't have to. They all want the same
thing. Reassurance. Help. Love.
Things I can't give them. My father
sends this stuff onto me. I let it pile up.
Why? Why do you keep it?
This is why
I can't go on. Live my life.
Why I have to stay
locked up here in the house.
I'm already living in a controlled
environment, Sam.
Nothing can touch me here.
I'm alone.
I'm safe.
"But instead of dying,
she shall only fall into...
a profound sleep
which shall last a hundred years."
That's my mom.
OK.
- Bye.
- Bye.
John Smith?
Hi. I'm Roger Stuart.
I'd like to talk to you for a moment.
Sit down.
What can I do for you?
Um... it's, uh--
it's my boy,
my son, Chris.
He needs help.
I've enquired around.
You come highly recommended.
What's the matter with him?
I wish I knew. He's bright, I know he is.
But he won't take part in school.
He won't join in. He won't learn.
And, God, he's so shy.
You think you could help him?
I wouldn't know that unless I met him.
Well he's not in the car. He wouldn't
come with me today.
You have
to come out to the house.
No that's out of the question.
It's just not the way I do it.
It won't work otherwise.
Please, if you come out to the house
he'll get to know you.
Then you can bring him back here
for the lessons. Please.
OK.
Great. Tomorrow morning's Saturday.
I'll send a car over to pick you up.
Thank you.
That reminds me of my first campaign,
when I ran for a seat in the Senate.
Upstate in my hometown,
my opponent went down to the ghetto,
he was handing out dollar bills to them
black people, trying to buy votes.
I went down there. I said
Then go back and get some more
'cos times is rough.
But once
in the voting booth, I want you
to vote for whomever
you damn well please."
Well, we won that election by-
what Sonny?
Twenty-nine.
Twenty-nine percentage point.
We've been winning ever since.
And those people spent that money
with a clear conscience.
Hi John! Good morning.
Nice to see you.
Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet
my son's tutor. John Smith.
- John this is Greg Stillson.
- How are you John?
Of course,
this gentlemen is Averill Grant?
Elliman. Sonny Elliman.
Sonny Elliman, right here.
Well Greg, you got some good ideas.
You gotta let me think about 'em.
Listen Roger, we've got a good
thing going and it's going strong.
And I want you to be a part of it. I need
your support. I need your expertise.
I need your input. And most
importantly I need your money.
God bless Roger.
I'll be seeing you.
Thanks for dropping by Greg.
- I'll see you. Bye, bye.
- I'll see you Sonny.
My God, what a glorious day.
Amen.
Sorry about that.
Well, let's go and see Chris.
Sure.
Chris, this is Johnny. Remember
I told you he was coming this morning.
I'll leave you two alone
to get acquainted.
Your father says there's
something wrong with you.
He wants me to bring you out of your
shell; I don't know what to do.
You don't have to do anything. It's my
dad that lives in a shell. Not me.
Chris has really taken
to you John. I'm impressed.
Made a lot of progress for one day.
Just had a talk.
Well, with Chris that's a real
achievement. You want a drink?
No.
Don't want a beer?
OK.
Brian, get him a beer.
Here let's listen to this.
Ninety-nine.
One hundred.
How are ya' doin'? I'm Greg Stillson.
Just thought I'd drop by here on my way
to the US Senate.
Greg Stillson. You remember
you met him in the hall this morning.
Thanks for coming out all of you.
Boy you gotta be in good shape
to go the full distance
for those big boys
down in Washington.
You gotta stay in shape
all the time for those boys.
You can't turn your back on 'em.
Just stay in better shape
than this country.
What the hell is happening
to this country?
Can anybody tell me
what the hell is going on?
I read in one of your local papers...
Can you believe this guy?
He's just getting warmed up.
Are you going
to vote for him, John?
I'm not even registered.
- You're not registered?
- No.
Well, get registered, pal, and vote
against this turkey. He's dangerous.
And I see all around me
so many unemployed.
What are you people doing here
in the middle of the day?
You're standing out in the cold.
Look at each other.
How do you feel about each other?
Are you proud of your communities?
Would you send the guy
next to you to the US Senate? Uh?
A real man of the people.
Jesus, what an act.
Can't they see through this guy?
I'm mixed up. You both acted like
you were friends this morning.
Guys like Stillson, you gotta walk the
thin line. You can't get too close,
'cos if they lose,
they'll drag you down with them.
On the other hand if he wins
- and this turkey just might -
you gotta make sure
he thought he was a good friend.
Know what I mean John?
They're not working there's
unemployment everywhere.
I've come down here today
with a job for every one of you.
I've come here today
with a challenge for all of you.
I'm challenging you right
here and now to join me.
Join a growing army of volunteer
workers on my campaign.
Let's send Greg Stillson to the US
Senate and mediocrity to hell.
What can I do for you boys?
You work late, Mr Brenner.
That's very admirable.
I'm Greg Stillson.
I know who you are, Mr Stillson.
Now take your paid gorilla
and get out of my office.
My friend Sonny doesn't
want to see anybody hurt.
But we got a little problem here.
Get to the point Mr Stillson.
You know I'm damn well even
in the polls. See, I'm catchin' on.
The people gotta a need for me.
I'm gonna win big
and I'll tell you something else.
I've had a vision
that I'm gonna be
President of the United States,
someday.
And I have accepted that responsibility.
And nobody, I mean nobody,
is gonna stop me.
Now, you can just imagine how I felt
when one of my loyal staff people
brought me your editorial that's
gonna hit the streets tomorrow.
You don't seem to like me,
Brenner. But that's OK.
Because I don't like you either.
How did you get that?
Well, like you, Brenner,
I'm not at liberty to reveal my sources.
Well, it doesn't make any difference.
Because you're right,
that editorial is gonna'
hit the streets tomorrow morning.
Not if we can make a deal.
What the hell
are your talking about?
I'm talkin' about you stayin' out
of the campaign business
and me stayin' out
of the publishing business.
Show him what we've got
to publish, Sonny.
That's your best shot.
I've got lots of loyal people
on my side, Brenner.
That young lady in the photographs
with you is one of them.
Now I've never met Mrs Brenner,
but I'm damn near sure that ain't her.
What do think, Sonny?
Is this Mrs Brenner?
It doesn't look like her.
You son of a bitch.
You set me up.
Who are you calling
a son of a bitch?
No, it's alright, Sonny. Let's give
Mr Brenner a chance to think about
his wife and kids.
And his position in the community.
What if I don't make a deal, Stillson?
Oh, you'll make a deal.
Otherwise I'll have my friend Sonny
take your godamn head off.
Good idea.
You see Sonny, I told you
he was a reasonable man.
Yeah. He's a nice man. I like him.
I like the wife too.
"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil"
prophet still, if bird or devil!
By that Heaven
that bends above us
by that God we both adore
Tell this soul with sorrow laden
if, within the distant Aidenn,
It shall clasp a sainted maiden
whom the angels named Lenore."
Chris, skip to the part where he talks
about "will I ever see her again".
"Eagerly I wished the morrow
Vainly I had sought to borrow
from my books surcease of sorrow.
Sorrow for the lost Lenore.
For the rare and radiant maiden
Whom the angels name Lenore
Nameless here for evermore".
Stop, I'll be right back.
Good afternoon, sir. We're out
in your neighbourhood today,
talking about Greg Stillson.
You're familiar with our candidate,
aren't you?
What do you think?
Yeah, right. But are you aware
of what Greg Stillson stands for?
Greg Stillson's mounting the most
successful third party movement
this state has ever seen.
Stillson represents both the poor
and the well-off, the young and the old.
Could you come back?
I have a student.
Oh, sure. I know you're busy. Can I
leave you some literature, though?
Sure.
Honey! Could you bring
some of those brochures?
Hello, Johnny.
Hi.
Is this where you're living now?
Yeah. I'm...
I'm back to teaching.
This is my husband, Walt.
Nice to meet you finally, John. I've
heard Sarah talk about you so often.
Hey. Come back, Johnny.
It's no fun reading by myself.
Chris. Walt and Sarah.
Hi.
We'll let you get back to work. We've
got a lot of ground to cover ourselves.
Don't we honey?
Nice to meet you.
Bye.
Don't forget who to vote for
on Election Day.
Bye.
Who was that?
Hey. You OK?
Why are you crying, Johnny?
Johnny!
What's the matter?
Nothing.
My ride's here.
I'm going with you.
I gotta talk to you.
Hi, Johnny.
What is this? What are you doing?
Pretty good stuff, huh?
I organised a hockey team for Chris
and some of his friends.
We have our
first practice this afternoon.
You are looking at the coach.
Call it off.
Take that stuff in the garage, OK?
There's going to be an accident.
Call it off.
Call it off? What for? Chris has been
looking forward to this all week, huh?
He's really coming out of his shell,
John.
Wait. I gotta talk to you.
We'll have a little nourishment
and then we'll hit the ice.
No. Listen to me. There's gonna'
be an accident. Call it off.
Don't be ridiculous. We always skate
on that pond until March.
What the hell is the matter with you?
You wanna kill your own son?
I'm scared, dad.
For Christ's sake, John. Don't be
scared. Just go and eat your cookies.
Don't you know who I am?
Course I know who you are. You think
I'd have you come into my son's life,
without checking you out. But I hired
you for your abilities as a teacher.
Not a fortune teller.
Don't give me any argument.
The ice is gonna break.
I want you outta here. I don't want you
in my boy's life, anymore.
And I don't want any argument
from you. I want you to do exactly
what I'm telling you now.
No Dad.
You don't know. It's not safe.
Alright to hell with it. To hell
with the whole thing. Forget it all.
Forget the hockey team, forget the
practice. But I want you outta here.
Whatever you say.
I'm sorry about the...
I'll see
that you'll get your final cheque.
I'm not crazy, you know. Don't let the
boy think I am. I'm right about this.
But we'll never know, will we?
Give me your hand.
Nothing to worry about now.
My driver will take you home.
You were right.
Chris! Hey, what's going on?
You're not even dressed.
You called it off.
I thought you called it off.
Why, that was just to get rid of him.
So! Are we going, or not?
Are you going to sit here and
pout like a baby in your room?
Or are you coming outside
to play hockey with your friends?
Right.
Hello. Who is it? Johnny!
Sarah.
See you down there, honey.
OK.
Do it, Jim.
For God's sake. I won't.
Do it! Put your hand
on the scanning screen
and you'll go down in history with me.
As what? The world's
greatest mass murderers.
You cowardly bastard.
You're not the voice of the people.
I am the voice of the people.
The people speak through me not you.
It came to me while I slept, Sonny.
My destiny. In the middle of the night,
it came to me. I must get up now.
Right now. And fulfil my destiny.
Now you put your goddamn hand
on that scanning screen, or I'll hack
it off and put it on for you. Do it!
May God forgive me.
Congratulations, General.
Complete the sequence,
Mr President.
My destiny.
Thank you Sonny.
Let them come up.
This is not necessary, Mr President.
We have a diplomatic solution.
Mr Vice President. Mr Secretary.
The missiles are flying. Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!
If you could go back in time. Germany,
say before Hitler came to power.
Knowing what you know now. What
would you do? Would you kill him?
Is that why you sent for me, John?
To ask me this question.
I have to talk to you, Sam.
Because I've had another episode.
Ah, yes. Go on.
I've been tutoring this boy.
His name is Stuart
and in the vision, I saw him drown.
I saw him die, Sam.
But that's not the point.
In the vision, there was something
missing. Something I couldn't see.
How do you mean?
I don't know. It was like
a blank spot... A dead zone.
Er, first of all tell me. Did the boy in fact
drown? You say you saw him drown.
No, no. His father wanted to take him to
play hockey. I talked him out of it.
The boy's alive.
Ah. Yes, don't you see?
Don't you see how clear it all is?
Not only can you see the future...
- You can...
- I can change it.
You can change it.
Exactly. Ha, here.
Yes John, that is your dead zone.
The possibility of altering
the outcome of your premonitions.
It's fascinating.
Let me make a note.
What about my question, Sam?
Huh? Oh, you mean
the one about Hitler.
What would you do?
I don't like the sound of this, John.
What are your getting at?
What would you do?
Would you kill him?
Alright. Alright.
I'll give you an answer.
I'm a man of medicine.
I'm expected to save lives
and ease suffering.
And I love people. Therefore, I'd have
no choice but to kill the son of a bitch.
You'd never get away alive.
It doesn't matter. I would kill him.
Nosdrovia. Skol.
Dear Sarah,
this is a hard letter to write.
So I'll try and make it short.
I can't go on hiding anymore.
That's what I've been doing.
Running and hiding. You know
I've had this figured out all wrong.
I always thought this power
of mine was a curse.
Now I can see it's a gift. Anyway,
by the time you get this letter,
it'll all be over. You never will
understand why, Sarah.
Guess nobody ever will.
But I know what I'm doing.
And I know I'm right.
Just remember there's never
been anyone for me except you.
Just wasn't in the cards
for us I guess.
I'll always love you,
Sarah. Johnny.
Thanks very much.
What's your name?
Michael.
Hello, Walt. How are you?
This is your baby?
Yeah.
Ah. Bring him up on stage.
I wanna thank all of you
from the bottom of my heart
for the tremendous support
you've given this campaign.
You've made this campaign the most
talked about, the most exciting,
the most important campaign
in the history of this great state.
And I've come here personally
to thank you for that.
Johnny!
- Give me him!
- Don't! No!
Sonny someone's trying to kill me.
Who are you? You son of a bitch.
Who sent you?
It's over.
You're finished.
Who was that kid with
the camera taking pictures?
I didn't see him.
You ass-hole.
It's OK. It's alright.
Oh Johnny. Why? Why?
Goodbye.
I love you.
