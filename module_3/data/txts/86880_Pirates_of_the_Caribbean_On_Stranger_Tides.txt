Who are you?
What is this?
Your Majesty, caught him up in
a fishing net. A fishing net.
Sire, he's been telling
stories. Stories that...
We believe he's found a...
Ponce de Le¨®n
Says he found Ponce de Le¨®n's ship.
- Or sailed on it.
- No, I told you,
Ponce de Le¨®n died 200 years ago.
Aye, but he died searching
for something, didn't he?
The Fountain of Youth.
How soon can you sail?
With the tide.
Over here! Lucky heather!
Pirate swords! Pirate swords!
Pirate's execution
today. Watch him swing!
Pirate puppets!
Take that, you!
Hurry, Papa, or we'll miss the hanging!
It's not a hanging, dear, it's a
trial. The hanging comes this afternoon.
Pirate hanging today!
Come on. Up you get.
Move along, pirate.
Or should I say, "Captain Pirate"?
Come on. Come on! Up you go.
Quiet! Order!
Quiet!
Now appearing before the court,
the notorious and
infamous pirate, pillager,
- and highwayman...
- Quiet!
...Captain Jack Sparrow!
I told you, the name's
Gibbs! Joshamee Gibbs!
- How many times...
- Hear ye, hear ye!
Presiding over these trials,
all rise and attend, the
Right Honorable Justice Smith!
My dear sir.
Quiet!
Now...
...what do we have here?
Jack?
Shut up!
I don't recognize him.
Not necessary. You were saying?
Jack Sparrow is not my name.
My name is Joshamee Gibbs.
Is that so?
- It says Jack Sparrow here.
- I told 'em.
I'm not Jack Sparrow, who I would
be happy to identify to the court
- if it would help my case.
- I think that would be a poor defense,
unless you want to be bludgeoned
again like a harp seal.
The prisoner claims of being innocent
to being Jack Sparrow. How do you find?
No trial? But aren't we here
to examine the evidence...
Foreman, your finding. Guilty?
Guilty verdict means he'll hang.
Hang him! String him up!
- Guilty?
- That's not fair!
Shut it.
Joshamee Gibbs, the crime of
which you've been found guilty of
is being innocent of being Jack Sparrow.
I hereby commute your sentence,
and order that you be
imprisoned for the remainder
of your miserable, moribund,
mutton-chopped life.
- What?!
- Hang him!
- Hang him!
- There.
- Balderdash!
- String him up! Hang him high!
Means shall be arranged
to transport this prisoner
to the Tower of London.
Thanks very much.
Ta.
Come on. Get up there.
Get up!
Hell's teeth. Now we're
both headed for prison.
Not to worry. I've paid off the driver.
Ten minutes, we'll be outside
London Town, horses waiting.
Tonight, we make the coast.
Then it's just a matter
of finding a ship.
- All part of the plan, yes?
- Exactly.
I arrived in London
Town just this morning
to rescue one Joshamee Gibbs from
one appointment with the gallows.
Seeing as how you're still alive,
I'd say it's all been
very successful thus far.
What happened to you, Gibbs?
I thought you were employed
elsewhere or otherwise engaged.
Aye. But I always listened like a
thief for news of the Black Pearl.
Nobody's seen where she
might next make port.
Then, I hear a rumor:
Jack Sparrow's in London with
a ship and looking for a crew.
- Am not.
- But that's what I heard.
Fact is, you're signing up men tonight.
Pub called The Captain's Daughter.
- Am not!
- Well, I thought it a bit odd,
but then, you've never been
the most predictable of sorts.
Tell me something.
There is another Jack Sparrow
out there sullying my good name?
- An impostor.
- Indeed.
But... an impostor with a ship.
And in need of a crew.
Which, as fate would have it, so am I.
What about you, Jack?
Last I heard, you were hell-bent
to find the Fountain of Youth.
Any luck?
Circumstances arose and
forced a compelling insight
regarding discretion and valor.
- Meaning, you gave up.
- I did not.
I am just as bent as ever. Hellishly so.
I shall taste those waters,
Master Gibbs. Mark my words.
Short trip.
All part of the plan, yes?
No.
You are Jack Sparrow?
There should be a "Captain"
in there somewhere.
I've heard of you.
And you know who I am.
Face is familiar. Have
I threatened you before?
You are in the presence of George
Augustus, Duke of Brunswick-Luneburg,
Archtreasurer and Prince-elector
of the Holy Roman Empire,
King of Great Britain
and Ireland, and of you.
- Doesn't ring a bell.
- I am informed
you have come to London to
procure a crew for your ship.
Vicious rumor. Not true.
Then you lied to me when you
told me you were Jack Sparrow.
I am Jack Sparrow, but I'm
not here to procure a crew.
That is... someone else.
Someone else named Jack Sparrow.
You've brought me the wrong wastrel.
Find the proper one and
dispose of this impostor.
No, wait, wait, wait. Hang on a minute.
I'm Jack Sparrow, the one and only.
And I am in London.
To procure a crew.
To undertake a voyage
- to the Fountain...
- What?
Will someone please remove
these infernal chains?
Come, come.
We know you're in possession of a map.
So confiscate the map, and
to the gallows with him!
Have you a map?
- No.
- Where is it?
The truth? I lost it.
- Quite recently, in fact.
- I have a report.
The Spanish have located
the Fountain of Youth.
I will not have some
melancholy Spanish monarch,
a Catholic, gain eternal life!
You do know the way to the Fountain?
Of course I do. Look at me.
You could guide an expedition.
With your permission, your heinie,
you will be providing, then, a ship...
...and a crew?
And a captain.
Afternoon, sire.
If I may be so bold, why
is that man not in chains?
He must be manacled at once.
At the center of my palace? Hardly.
Hector.
How nice to see a fellow
pirate make good of himself.
Pirate? Nay. Privateer.
On a sanctioned mission under the
authority and protection of the Crown.
As may be, but first,
what has become of my beloved Pearl?
I lost the Pearl as I lost my leg.
- Lost the Pearl?
- Aye.
I defended her mightily enough,
but she be sunk nonetheless.
If that ship be sunk properly,
you should be sunk with it.
Captain Barbossa, each second we
tarry, the Spanish outdistance us.
I have every confidence you
will prevail and be rewarded
with the high station you so desire.
- To serve doth suffice, sire.
- You, sir, have stooped.
Jack, our sands be all but run.
Where's the harm in
joining the winning side?
And you do meet a nicer class of person.
I understand everything.
Except that wig.
He's getting away! Stop him!
- Head him off!
- No! Stop that pirate!
Come down!
- He escaped?
- Leave it to me, sire.
Guards! Guards!
- Arms at ready!
- Aye, sir!
Find him!
Finders keepers!
There!
Is that it?
Halt! Stop that carriage!
Head him off!
Out of the way!
Stop that pirate!
Move out of the way!
Stop that man!
Don't let him get away!
Fire!
He's getting away! After him! Stop him!
After him!
Filthy pirate.
Hello, Jackie.
Hello, Dad.
I heard you're putting together a crew.
If enough people keep
saying it, it must be true.
I heard where you're
headed. The Fountain.
Have you been there?
Does this face look like it's
been to the Fountain of Youth?
- Depends on the light.
- Son, the Fountain.
There'll be items required
for the profane ritual.
Two chalices.
- On the map there was a chalice.
- Two, silver.
From the Ponce de León
ship. You'll need both.
- For?
- The ritual. Don't be a fool, Jackie.
Find out every detail
before you set sail.
Oh, set sail. Love to.
But for that, I may need a ship.
Those folk, over
there, they have a ship.
They're signing up sailors right now.
My heart is pierced by Cupid
I disdain all glittering gold
And one last thing, Jackie.
The Fountain will test
you. Mark my words.
My heart is pierced by Cupid
I disdain all glittering gold
There is nothing can console me
But my jolly sailor bold
I hear you be recruiting a crew.
Aye. That is,
Jack Sparrow be putting
together a modest venture.
You got some nerve, ain't ya?
Turning up here dressed like that?
What are you, some kind of impostor?
Have you any idea who I am, mate?
Oi, muckers!
There's a bloke here what's
forgotten his own name!
Lads, I'm sailing with Sparrow.
Who'll buy a sailor a drink?
Who's next?
Bring us some more of those ones.
Yeah, make it four.
You've stolen me, and I'm
here to take meself back.
Stop doing that.
Only one person alive knows that move.
Always wanted to do that.
Hello, Angelica.
Hello, Jack. Are you impressed?
I think I almost killed
you once or twice there.
I'm touched at this most
sincerest form of flattery.
But why?
You were the only pirate
I thought I would pass for.
That is not a compliment.
Don't worry, Jack. I
forgave you a long time ago.
- For what? For leaving you?
- Recall that I left you.
A gentleman allows a lady
to maintain her fictions.
Look, Sparrow. As long as
my sailors get their money,
they're willing to put up with
any number of peculiarities.
There is one peculiarity with
which I will not put up with.
I will be impersonated as
"Captain." Nothing less.
Well, for that, you need a ship,
and as it turns out, I have one.
I could use a ship.
I hear tell you've been to the Fountain.
There be a lot of hear-telling
going on these days.
- The Fountain of Youth.
- Dearest Angelica, fret not.
You still have a few usable years left.
Always so charming.
You didn't answer me.
Aye. Regarding the Fountain.
Waste of time, really...
Milady, I see unseamanlike fellows
of an officious-looking nature.
Wretched pirates! Find 'em! Maggots!
Friends of yours?
I may have unintentionally
slighted some king or other.
Open it!
- Yeah, you haven't changed.
- Implying the need?
Yes.
Open this door, in the
name of His Majesty.
You betrayed me. You
seduced me and you used me.
I was innocent of the ways of men.
You demonstrated a lot of technique
for someone I supposedly corrupted.
Imminent danger. Here, now, milady!
Open it!
I was ready to take my vows. And you...
What were you doing in a
Spanish convent, anyway?
Mistook it for a
brothel. Honest mistake.
- There he is!
- Over there!
We are at a disadvantage.
Speak for yourself. Unlike
some who pretend to be,
but cannot, in fact, hold a candle to,
I am Captain Jack Sparrow.
How can you say I used you?
You know exactly how.
I know, but how can you say it?
- So, what is it?
- What is what?
About the Fountain.
What do you know?
You don't happen to be in possession
of two silver chalices,
circa Ponce de León?
- No.
- Thought not.
- Why?
- I hear stories.
Rumors.
You are, of course, aware of the ritual.
Yes, I am.
What is it? What is required?
A mermaid, Jack.
There's been a mistake.
It's a life sentence, not death. Life!
- Barbossa.
- Thank you, gentlemen.
I trust you can tie a noose.
That's a hard thing,
forcing a man to twist
his own hanging rope.
You must lie in your
bed the way you made it.
What's happened to you?
- Where be Jack Sparrow?
- He escaped.
I'm on a tight schedule, Gibbs.
The HMS Providence sets
sail at first light.
If you do not care to
watch it hanging here dead,
with a mouth full of flies...
...speak now.
Take me with you. Any
point of the compass...
Take you where, Gibbs?
The Fountain? Aye?
Is that where Jack be headed?
Have you anything you
can offer me, Gibbs?
Anything at all?
Upon me naked word,
you'll not see the dawn.
Hand it over.
- You fool!
- I had just enough time
to study those infernal circles.
Every route, every destination.
All safe... in here.
Welcome back to His
Majesty's navy, Master Gibbs.
Show a leg, sailor!
Aye, sir.
What?
- There's been a horrible mistake.
- Keep moving.
- I'm not supposed to be here.
- Many a man's woken up at sea,
no idea what, when, wherefore or why.
No memory of the night
afore, whence he signed up
and drank away all his bonus money.
No, no, no. You don't understand, mate.
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.
The original. The only.
Scrum, and the pleasure's
all mine. Now, keep moving.
Scrum.
Get your elbows in!
Why is there a glass coffin?
Do I look like a man in charge?
- Where am I?
- 'Scuse me, Captain Sparrow, sir.
I be right honored to welcome you aboard
our world-renowned vessel of
infamy, Queen Anne's Revenge.
Blackbeard.
Work!
- He's a curious one.
- He's been zombiefied.
Zombiefied.
Blackbeard's doing. All
the officers are the same.
Makes 'em more compliant.
And perpetually ill-tempered.
- Come on. Scrub.
- Yeah.
Pull! Pull! Pull!
Five days underway, at least.
Aye. You can tell that
by the smell of the sea?
Smell of the crew.
Oi. What did that poor sod do?
And how can I make sure to not?
Him? Churchly fellow.
Always going on about the Lord Almighty.
Bible-thumper on this ship?
A missionary is his story.
What I heard was he
got captured in a raid.
Rest of the ship got
killed, but not 'im.
First mate wouldn't let it happen
on account of his premier
standing with the Lord.
A first mate sticking her
neck out for some prisoner.
That you don't see.
"Her"? First mate is a "her"?
Back to work!
Steady as she goes.
You are a ruthless,
soulless, cross-grained cur.
- I told you I had a ship.
- No, Blackbeard has a ship,
upon which I am now imprisoned.
We can do this, Jack.
The Fountain of Youth,
like you always wanted.
Blackbeard. Edward Teach.
The pirate all pirates fear.
Resurrector of the
dead in his spare time.
- He will listen to me.
- He listens to no one.
Maybe to his own daughter?
Daughter as in... beget by?
Long-lost. Recently found.
Who loves her dear
papa with all her soul.
- He bought that?
- I sold that.
Then it's the Fountain of Youth for him,
or him and you, not you and me.
No, Jack, that's the best part.
He will be dead.
You'll be handling that
part yourself, then?
There is a prophecy.
Maybe you don't believe
in the supernatural.
Oh, no, no. I've seen a thing or two.
The prophecy is this:
Blackbeard will meet his
death within a fortnight
at the hands of a one-legged man.
That's why he needs the Fountain, Jack.
Master Gibbs, short we are a map.
Perhaps you'd be so kind
as to provide us an heading.
Be a gem and pour me a gulper.
Nay. We be privateers,
not pirates, Master Gibbs.
And in the king's
name, we behave as such.
Aye, Captain.
Be we on the proper course, Gibbs?
Aye, it be proper. There's your proof.
The Spaniard.
All hands! Battle
stations! Get to windward!
- All hands, windward!
- Harden up two points!
- Two points!
- Cast loose the cannons!
- Gunners, take posts!
- Take position! Gunners ready, sir!
- Out! Thrust!
- Await orders.
Steady!
Guns armed, awaiting orders, sir.
Sir. Orders, sir?
He never so much as turned his head.
The Fountain is the prize.
It appears we be not even worth
the time it'd take to sink us.
And now we've fallen behind.
All hands, make more sail!
All hands, more sail!
Ride hard between wind and tide!
The topic, gentlemen, is mutiny.
Mutiny most foul.
Aye. I signed up to sail under
Jack Sparrow, not some pretender.
And a lady, at that.
And mention was failed to
be made of this uncanny crew.
Make my toes curl, they do.
I got 'em. All of them.
- Well done.
- Good lad.
On to it, then. Blackbeard.
- What are his habits?
- Stays mostly to his cabin.
That's right, mostly to his cabin.
- Yes, but when he comes out...
- He don't really come out.
He must come out sometime.
Not really, no.
Any of you sail with him before?
- No, no.
- I've never.
Definitely not.
- Any of you seen him before?
- Not really, no.
Stays to his cabin,
no one sailed with him,
no one's seen him...
Good news, gentlemen. This
is not Blackbeard's ship.
This is not the Queen Anne's Revenge.
No, this be the Queen
Anne's Revenge, right enough.
How do you know?
I've seen the name, on
the back of the ship.
Gentlemen, sirs, fellow conscriptees...
...you have been monstrously deceived.
- We are decepted, then?
- Yes.
You've nay been informed
of a destination.
Death lies before us
as we sail for the Fountain of Youth.
It would be a sorry plight, mates.
- Death, for certain.
- The garden of darkened souls.
- Untimely our ends will be.
- Unless...
...we take the ship.
We take the ship, then. Now!
Go on, then.
- Help me, shipmates!
- Give it to 'em!
- Wake up! It's ours!
- Come on!
Get up! Off your backside!
- Get off your fannies!
- Take it to them, lads!
Help me! Fight!
Jack.
If this is a dream, you can
keep the sword and boots on.
- If it's not...
- It's a dream.
No, it's not!
I thought I should give you fair
warning, we're taking the ship.
Nothing personal.
Think you might be
better off if you just...
...stay out of it.
Boggit.
Wretch!
You're either with us or against us!
I am not with you,
neither am I against you!
Can he do that?
He's religious. I believe it's required.
Fight to the bitter end,
you cack-handed deck apes!
Take him, men. Tie him down tight!
The ship is ours!
Gentlemen.
I be placed in a bewilderment.
There I were, resting,
and upon a sudden, I hear
an ungodly row on deck.
Sailors abandon their posts
without orders, without leave.
Men before the mast,
taking the ship for themselves.
What be that, First Mate?
- Mutiny, Captain.
- Again?
- Mutiny!
- Aye.
Mutiny.
And what fate befalls mutineers?
Now, we know the answer
to that, do we not?
Mutineers hang!
Captain, I wish to report a mutiny.
I can name fingers and point names.
No need, Mr. Sparrow.
They are sheep. You, their shepherd.
Have I mentioned, sir, what
a lovely daughter you have?
A fitting last sight for a doomed soul.
Remember, Father. We need him.
If I don't kill a man
every now and then,
- they forget who I am.
- Coward!
They do not forget.
Your crew sees you for
the miscreant you are.
A coward, no matter how many you slay.
Twice in one day, I find
myself in a bewilderment.
You are not bewildered, you are afraid.
You dare not walk the path of
righteousness, the way of the light.
No, sir. The truth is it be
much simpler than all that.
- I am a bad man.
- That, too.
I might have to kill you too, catechist.
- No!
- All Latin blood like her mother.
Father, I beg you.
There I be again, forgetting
why the missionary is here.
My daughter fears for my
soul, or what's left of it.
You truly wish to save me, my child?
Every soul can be saved.
Be that true, young cleric?
Yes. Though you I see
as a bit of a long shot.
Still, I pray for every unfortunate
soul on this hell-bound vessel.
You disarm me with your faith.
Eight bells!
Which of you unfortunate
souls stood watch?
- I did. I stood watch.
- Gunner.
You?
Aye.
Aye.
The cook.
Perfect. Lower the longboat!
Bring her about!
- Why do you do this?
- Mutiny. Our laws be clear.
Our laws allow the
Captain to show leniency.
I have given this man a
chance to determine his fate,
a gift not afforded to all.
Oh, you now.
Chance to show the
worth of your prayers.
Pray he be delivered from... evil?
Course made!
Stop. Give that man a
chance. Give yourself a...
You know when I feel
closest to our Maker?
When I see suffering, pain and anguish.
That's when the true design
of this world is revealed.
And I see it revealed when in
times of hardship and tragedy,
kindness and compassion
are shown to those in need.
Perhaps you should pray
for him to be unharmed, yes?
- Please, there's still hope...
- Again!
I actually have no interest
in the Fountain whatsoever,
so, if your heart is set,
you may drop me off anywhere you like.
That'll be all, Quartermaster.
Your words surround you like
fog and make you hard to see.
And what of you, the mighty Blackbeard?
Beheaded they say. Still, your body swam
three times around your ship,
then climbed back onboard.
And here you are, running scared.
- Scared.
- To the Fountain.
The Quartermaster sees
things before they happen.
He has foreseen my death,
and so the fates have spoken.
The threads of destiny woven.
You have a ridiculously
high regard for fate, mate.
- And you?
- Me?
I'm skeptical of predicting
any future... which includes me.
It'd be foolish to battle fate,
but I'd be tempted to cheat it.
I will reach the
Fountain. You will lead me.
That knife will serve you no
better than the mutiny you devised.
Mutiny served me well.
It gained me an audience with you.
Aye.
To warn you.
Regarding your first mate,
who pretends to be persons she is not.
Do tell.
She is not your daughter.
You dare to speak thusly
of my flesh and blood?
Sir, the woman is consummate
in the art of deception.
I know. As I mostly unwittingly
set her on her wicked path.
Though I cannot claim credit
for her existing abundance
of natural talent.
Angelica. My beloved daughter,
the one true good thing
I have done in this life,
and you claim to be the
one who corrupted her?
Sir, what she is is pure evil.
More to be feared than a wild beast.
Hungry wild beast with gnashing teeth.
Vengeful, hungry from hell beast...
- Father?
- Sweetness!
No need to hurt him, Father.
He will help us. Won't you, Jack?
You see? Even now, she
attends to your welfare,
giving lie to the
claims you make of her.
You will lead us to the Fountain. Yes?
Put another way.
If I do not make it to
the Fountain in time...
...neither will you.
I'll have a wee look-see at those
charts straight away then, shall I?
Sir.
- Aye?
- Captain, sir,
I am unhappy to report rumors, sir,
among the crew, as to our destination.
Shut your trap and make way.
- That's the way of it, then.
- No disrespect, sir.
What do the men fear?
Say it. Speak the words.
Whitecap Bay.
Aye, Whitecap Bay.
And every worthless seaman
fears the name, and rightly so,
though few know why or dare to ask.
Be the stories true?
Say what robs you of
your staunch heart, Gibbs,
or forever leave it to
the wider fields of fancy.
Mermaids, Captain.
Aye. Mermaids.
Sea ghouls, devil fish, dreadful
in hunger for flesh of man.
Mermaid waters, that be our path.
Cling to your soul, Gibbs,
as mermaids be given to take the rest...
...to the bone.
Steady! Steady, men! Find your courage,
or be ready to purpose your fear!
Save yourselves!
- Man overboard!
- Nay! A deserter.
- Come about.
- Nay!
Gentlemen, I shall not ask
any more of any man than what
that man can deliver, but I do
ask this: Are we not king's men?
Aye.
- On the king's mission?
- Aye.
I did not note any fear in the eyes
of the Spanish as they passed us by.
- Are we not king's men?
- Aye!
Aye! Hands all off, and bear away!
Stave on ahead to Whitecap Bay!
Bear on, Whitecap Bay!
Come.
Little drink?
Wine, music, candlelight.
I think we've traveled
down this road before, Jack.
Yes, we have.
I remember it well.
Winding, twisting and
turning, gyrating, writhing.
Incessant writhing.
Do you recall Saint Dominique?
La Martinique.
I tried to kill you in Saint Dominique.
Either or.
Hardly appropriate for a first mate.
Was I the first? I've often wondered.
You can be so charming when
you want something, Jack.
The trick is finding out what.
The truth, then, is it?
Blackbeard has served his purpose.
You and I can go to
the Fountain together,
where we shall bathe one
another in equal shares of fame
and other assorted debaucheries.
And I'll tell you the
ritual of the Fountain.
Yes. The profane ritual.
Can I trust you, Jack?
- I need you on my side.
- Oh, my dearest Angelica.
You and I are as thick as thieves, love.
Tell me the rules.
Water from the Fountain of Youth.
The shimmering tear of a mermaid.
The silver chalices of Ponce de León.
With these items...
- Yes?
- With these items,
you may take all the years
of life from another, Jack.
You know what that means.
We cannot go alone, you and I.
The ritual requires a victim.
- That is unfortunate.
- Yes, it is.
I find my desire for the
Fountain greatly lessened.
But there is something
onboard you do want.
What about Blackbeard?
He's in the chart room.
We'll have to be quick.
He keeps each ship as a prize.
You help me, and I
promise you your pick.
Though I think I know
the one you will choose.
The Black Pearl in a bottle?
Why is the Black Pearl in a bottle?
He's even more annoying in miniature.
- Do we have a deal, Jack?
- Angelica, I know you.
You are not going to steal
the life of some innocent man.
What about the one-legged man?
I need years, Jack.
Not for me. For my father.
I am truly the daughter of Blackbeard.
You've fallen for your own con, love.
No, he is my father.
The lies I told you were not lies.
You lied to me by telling me the truth?
- Yes.
- That's very good.
- May I use that?
- I'm sure you will, anyway.
Of course I will.
So, will you not give up this quest?
I want a father, Jack.
I haven't had one.
Angelica, your father, Blackbeard...
...he is evil,
and he will kill you given the chance.
- He cannot be saved.
- And who are you to set
the limits on redemption?
You stole years of my
life, Jack. You owe me.
And you are en route to
getting yourself killed,
and I am not inclined
to stand by and watch.
Whitecap Bay!
All hands on deck! Set to the longboats!
Lay 'em out flat!
No tangles. Make 'em look
pretty for our dainty guests.
We're gonna need light. A lot of light.
Come!
Smell that? Whale oil. Stuff
burns like a miracle from God.
- Can you make it work?
- Made by the English.
Let's not get our hopes up.
The old moon in the arms of the new one.
First of the summer.
Perfect for hunting a mermaid's tear.
We're doomed. They be
drawn to man-made light.
- Sharks?
- Worse than sharks, boy.
There'll be mermaids
upon us within the hour,
you mark my words. And we're the bait.
I heard it said a kiss from a mermaid
protects a sailor from drowning.
Don't be a fool! Mermaids
are all female, son,
and lovely as a dream of heaven.
But when it comes time to
churn butter, so to speak,
they snatch a sailor out of a boat
or off the deck of a
ship, have their way,
and then the sailors are pulled
to bottom and drowned and eaten.
Or, sometimes, the other way around.
- Sing.
- What?
They like to hear singing.
My name is Maria
A merchant's daughter fair
- Louder.
- And I have left my parents
And 3,000 pounds a year
My heart is pierced by Cupid
I disdain all glittering gold
There is nothing can console me
But my jolly sailor bold
My heart is pierced by Cupid
I disdain all glittering gold
There is nothing can console me
But my jolly sailor bold
Lord save me.
Man, look. Look there.
You'll scare her off!
Aye, and good riddance!
Can you talk?
Yes.
You're beautiful.
- Are you the one who sings?
- Aye.
Are you my jolly sailor bold?
- Aye, that I be.
- Scrum, comport yourself!
Boys! There ain't much been given to me
in my brief, miserable life,
there's the truth in it.
But, by God, I'll have it said
that Scrum had himself a
kiss from a proper mermaid!
My heart is pierced by Cupid
I disdain all glittering gold
There is nothing can console me
But my jolly sailor bold
Come all ye pretty fair maids
Whoever you may be
Who love a jolly sailor bold
That ploughs the raging sea
My heart is pierced by Cupid
I disdain all glittering gold
There is nothing can console me
But my jolly sailor bold
My heart is pierced by Cupid
I disdain all glittering gold
There is nothing can console me
But my jolly sailor bold
Out upon it! It has begun!
Light 'em up!
Muster your courage! Drive 'em to shore!
Nets into the water! Quickly!
Retreat, all, to land! For your lives!
Retreat, I say!
Cowards! Back in the water!
There be no refuge on land! On my word!
We got one!
I'm in love!
Check the wounded!
See if you can find
one mermaid still alive!
Come, give a hand!
Well done, sailor.
Did everyone see that?
Because I will not be doing it again.
Back to the ship. We head
for a protected cove. Now.
- Lord. Is that?
- Mermaid.
- Give up this madness now.
- I cannot.
Ever walk on the beach,
look back and see your
footsteps in the sand?
It's like that, except the
footsteps lie before me.
- Footstep, actually.
- Whitecap Bay, sir.
We must hasten.
We travel by foot. Gibbs,
I require a heading.
- But, sir, the men.
- They be dead already.
- They don't sound dead.
- Oh, is that so?
Well, I hear nothing
but seagulls nesting.
What is it that you hear, Mr. Groves?
Seagulls... nesting.
- Nothing more.
- Heading, Gibbs?
My God.
Your head or my heading.
I'll have me one or
t'other, I don't care which.
All hands, forward!
- It's to you now, Sparrow.
- Was that really necessary?
Best you not know the exact
whereabouts of my ship.
- I be a cautious man.
- So be I.
What I want first...
...is Ponce De León's ship.
Why is it we've got to bring her along?
Because tears don't
keep. We need them fresh.
What is the ritual again?
Water from the Fountain
and a mermaid's tear?
And two silver chalices.
One cup with a tear, one without.
So, one with a tear and water in both?
Quite complicated, is it not?
Both get water. One gets a tear.
The person who drinks
the water with the tear
gets all the years of
life from the other.
How many years?
All the years that they have lived,
and they could have lived,
if fate had been kinder.
Clergyman.
On the off chance that this
does not go well for me,
I would like it noted here and now
that I am fully prepared to
believe in whatever I must,
so that I may be
welcomed into that place
where all the goody-goodies
get to go. Savvy?
We have a word for that,
Jack. You can convert.
I was thinking more
of an as-needed basis.
Quartermaster!
- Aye?
- She cannot breathe!
- She has water.
- She needs air!
- Open this.
- She will escape.
- You're killing her.
- I support the missionary's position.
See?
Onward.
Just as I thought. Not this way!
This is the way, isn't it?
'Course it is, but we
should go around to the east.
That would take us out of
the path of the chalices.
- Well, then we'll circle back.
- There is no time.
You're the one who insisted
on bringing the bloody mermaid.
- Well, the mutiny didn't help.
- You walk like a girl.
- You would know.
- Someone must go.
You mean split up?
You mean jump? This
I cannot wait to see.
Sparrow will go. Find the
ship, retrieve the chalices.
Sparrow? What makes you
think he will come back?
Yes, what makes you
think he will come back?
We cannot trust him, Father. I'll go.
She'll go.
How much farther to the Fountain?
I'm running out of time.
About a day's march north,
following that river,
you'll get to a series of
pools. Then you're close.
You will go.
I was sure it would come to this.
You know that feeling you get sometimes
when you're standing in a high place?
Sudden urge to jump?
I don't have it.
I need those chalices.
Shoot. Save me the bother of the fall.
You will go. You will return...
...or I will kill her.
You won't kill your own daughter.
Quartermaster, get me six more pistols,
remove the shot from all but two,
but do not tell me which two.
You get to choose, Mr. Sparrow.
No.
No.
- Yes.
- You're sure?
'Course I am.
Again.
Please, they're not even loaded.
Again.
If you're so keen on killing her,
- why don't you just let her jump?
- What?
If you jump and die,
then she will have her chance.
Again.
Oi...
...if I jump, will I survive?
The doll.
- Yes, now you will survive.
- This is nonsense! I'm going!
Wet. Wet again.
We go on. Due north to the Fountain.
Well played, Father.
You knew which guns were loaded, right?
Of course, my love.
Be nice to have a map about now.
Or a ship.
Stop! Hold very still.
Ye dare not let it touch your skin.
What? What be wrong with
an older man having a hobby?
What are you stopping for, eh? Push on!
- Push on!
- You can sleep when you're dead.
Push on!
Fortune continues to favor us.
The Santiago.
Famously captained by Ponce de León.
There's no one there.
Right, then.
We must not stop.
You will walk.
I cannot.
Walk or die.
Put your arms around me.
- I do not ask for help.
- But you need it.
- We're in a hurry, yes?
- Do not fall behind.
Hold here 'til I say!
Such beauty.
Surely you're one of
God's own creations,
and not a descendant
of those dark creatures
who found no refuge on the Ark.
Such beauty...
...and yet deadly.
- Deadly? No.
- You attacked me.
No. You are different.
Different?
Are you not? You protect.
Did you?
You pushed me down out of the way.
- You see the Fountain?
- No, but we are close.
Bring the creature. Cover its head.
She has a name!
Pray tell.
She is Syrena.
Ponce de León.
If 40 pirates dreamt
40 nights of treasure,
it would not match the
contents of this room.
You.
- You.
- No...
...you.
- I was here first.
- You, why are you here?
- Blackbeard sent me.
- Why are you?
- Silver chalices
- for my royal liege.
- Oh, please.
Back, back! We have to balance it out!
The whole ship will slide!
Right, then.
What if we each choose an item
of approximately equal weight?
Put it back!
We touch nothing!
What about that?
The chalices.
Oi! Why do you get to look first?
Fine, then.
- Together.
- Together.
Rocks.
The Spanish.
They're ahead of us, mate.
I shall have a look at that
map. If it's what I fear...
I wonder why they left this behind.
Don't touch the map.
They know the path,
but I can also see where
they'll most likely make camp.
Jack!
Gibbs, I was just on me way
to break you out of jail.
You stole my map.
Right. Best be started.
Ol?
Mermaids.
Careful, these pools run deep.
If she escapes, all
is lost. Quartermaster.
Look. Look!
Staked out to die, to dry in the sun.
Only half in the water.
Not enough to live,
but just enough to make the dying slow.
Think on it.
Your people, murdered,
harvested for their tears.
Syrena, won't you cry?
All die, even you.
- Soon, I hear.
- Listen...
Listen.
Can you not hear your sisters scream?
Do you not hear them?
We need but one tear.
Vile creature!
- Chop off her fingers, one by one!
- Choke her!
Cut out the tears from behind the eyes!
Where's your voice in this?
Maybe she'll have a change
of heart when the sun rises.
Oh, aye, she will burn, but
I cannot wait for the sun.
Perhaps we should build a fire.
- No.
- Do not contest me, cleric.
- You will not torture her.
- We need only one tear.
I will tear every scale from
her body one by one if I see fit.
If that displeases you, go pray.
I was wrong. Not every soul
can be saved. Yours cannot.
Behold, gentlemen, a
man formerly of faith.
That vile creature, as you call
her, is worth a hundred of you.
Oh, you care for her?
You fancy her.
And do not deny what
is clear to my eyes.
Question is...
...does she fancy you?
By God, she does. We are in luck!
Bring forth a tear...
...or witness the
death of this poor soul.
Syrena, if you could manage a tear,
I would be grateful.
Sadness, yes,
- but no sorrow... yet.
- Not by your hand, Father!
Time and tide wait for
none. Quartermaster.
Aye, mermaids are tough.
The lot of them.
Tie her up like the
others. And get rid of this.
- You are confident?
- Yes.
I am a woman. So is she.
What's your play, Jack?
Throwing in with Barbossa.
There is a girl...
...a female... of the opposite sex.
- When is there not?
- Perhaps I should say "damsel."
You're rescuing a damsel?
Well, there's a first.
Yes, but it's just that I
may have caused said damsel
- some manner of harm many moons ago.
- Out with it.
Gibbs, this is the woman from Seville.
Ah, you pretended to love her, then
you left her and broke her heart.
Worse. I may have had,
briefly, mind you...
...stirrings.
- Stirrings?
- Stirrings.
- What? Like feelings, you mean?
No, no, no. Not quite all the
way to feelings. More like...
All right, feelings, damn you.
And you left her still. That's low.
Thank you.
Stealth over force.
I'll take it from here on
account of your condition.
You don't have termites, do you?
I appreciate your concern, Jack,
but I'll be keeping you
company all the same.
Hold here, Lieutenant
Commander. Wait for my signal.
There. That one. That be the leader.
Make note of his tent
because that's where...
No, wait. By God, that
must be them right there.
Your sword smells funny.
Aye. Poison from the
innards of poisonous toads.
Just a scratch, you're
a dead man in minutes.
Would you mind pointing
it the other way?
I don't like toads.
- What are you doing?
- Planning an escape route.
- Isn't that how you do it?
- Yes.
Or sometimes I just... improvise.
Now what?
We stroll out, slow and steady.
Just like we belong.
- I'm sorry, Syrena.
- Philip, you're alive.
- Yes.
- You came for me.
Why?
You're different, are you not?
Do you know not of kindness? Compassion?
Tears of sorrow, never.
Mermaids be too tough for that.
But tears of joy...
They say these be the
more potent anyway.
Syrena, on my word,
I had no part in this.
Let her go. You don't need her now.
Let her go? No.
Secure her bonds. We
leave her with her own.
How's that escape route working?
Here's your chance to improvise.
I'm attempting it.
I might be able to get a hand loose.
Oh, you got a knife. That's very good.
Better.
I want one of those.
Here's to revenge. Sweet and clear.
- Revenge?
- Come, come, Hector.
If you wanted the chalices,
you'd seen they were missing and gone.
You were lying in wait, for Blackbeard.
King George. Privateer. Wig.
Cheap theatrical facade.
- I'm not buying it.
- You weren't there that night.
- When the Pearl was lost?
- Taken, not lost.
We were off the coast of Hispaniola
when we came under attack.
No provocation nor warning
nor offer of parley.
We were peppered with cannon fire.
And then the sea beneath
the Pearl began to roil.
The Pearl was pitching
and yawing violently.
Every plank, every rail,
every spar, all at once, began to creak.
The rigging had come to life.
Our own ship turned against us...
...tangling the crew, wrapping
around 'em like snakes.
And wrapping around me leg.
But me arms were free
and me sword was to hand.
I am the master of me
ship, not Blackbeard.
I am the master of my
fate, not Blackbeard.
So I did what needed done.
I survived.
So... you're not after the Fountain.
I care not for King
George or tavern yarns
that give hope for a healed limb.
But I'd give my left arm
for a chance at Blackbeard.
- Not your right?
- I need me good arm
to drive my poisoned
blade through his heart.
I'll see you get the chance, mate.
The prisoner's escaping.
He's escaping! Fan out! Find him!
Go! Go!
Hold your fire! I want him alive!
I figured that was the signal.
- Go! Prepare to move out!
- The enemy is soon upon us.
I'm sorry about the chalices, Jack,
but I've an appointment to keep.
- I'll not be going back.
- No need.
- Shall we have a drink?
- We'll drink at the Fountain.
How is it we can never meet without
you pointing something at me?
You brought the chalices, Sparrow?
Aye. Oi!
- I see you brought a friend.
- I did.
And the one-legged
man, he is near. Aye?
Aye.
Now...
Before I go just handing them over,
I do have one or two conditions.
- Name them.
- Firstly,
I'll be having me compass
back. No, no, that's secondly.
Firstly, upon your word,
you will bring no harm to Angelica.
I'll make no vows to the
likes of you, Sparrow.
But it costs me nothing to admit
that she was never in harm's way.
Secondly then, priorly firstly,
I will be having me compass back.
Please? I do deserve it.
Do you have any idea how difficult
it was to catch that filthy pig?
Not the big one, the four-legged one.
Thank you. And thirdly, Mr. Beard,
there are times, not very often,
when I do reflect upon
my heinous misdeeds.
Chief among them, I note how
poorly I have treated Mr. Gibbs,
- my loyal first mate.
- Aye! Now you bring it up...
Left him to rot in
jail, I did. Didn't care.
Still don't. But, point being,
you must let him go free.
- Is that it?
- I think so.
Quick, or the pig runs, and
good luck getting those chalices.
Jack, if it's all the same
to you, I'd be just as...
Done.
Release the swine.
Perhaps, if you don't mind, I could
tag along with you folk for a...
This will lead you to freedom, mate.
I could have swore it was
somewhere right around here.
We must not stop.
Dead end.
Dead. End.
Dead end.
Jack, I'm starting to think you
don't know where you're going.
It is not the destination so
much as the journey, they say.
Chalices, if you please.
Stand back.
Jack...
...have you ever, in fact...
...seen with your own
eyes... the Fountain of Youth?
I'm sorry, could you
repeat the question, please?
Quartermaster.
No, no!
Wait, wait! Wait.
"Aqua... de Vida."
Master Scrum...
...do you mind?
- Squire?
So beautiful.
Sparrow, I'll be the first
to taste those waters.
Father.
The one-legged man.
- You brought him here.
- Would I do that?
Edward Teach!
For crimes committed on the high seas,
by the authority granted me
by His Majesty the King...
...and with a goodly amount
of personal satisfaction...
...I hereby place you in
the custody of the court,
and declare you to be my prisoner.
My trick's out, is that it?
Such crimes do include, but are
not limited to, piracy, treason,
murder, torture of
the most heinous sort,
including the brutal theft of one
used, twisted, hairy right leg.
You... dare face this sword?
This far away from your ship? Aye.
Aye. That be the cold breath
of fate I feel down my nape.
But I'll have one last fight, by God.
Kill 'em all!
Hang on a minute.
I just... I just need
to understand something.
Right, so, you will fight against them,
they will fight against you.
All on account of him
wanting to kill him?
Where is the sense? Exactly.
I say, let them fight each
other while we lay back,
watch, have a drink, place some wagers!
Aye.
- Kill 'em!
- No quarter!
Get off me!
Scrum, the chalices!
And the tear! Follow!
Fight!
Hand it over. The tear.
There's a good lad.
I'm more afraid of her than I am of you.
Hand it over. There's a good lad.
- The chalices, if you please.
- Sorry, Jack.
I told you, I need years.
And now, yours will do.
Scrum!
Syrena...
Oh God, you will not take her.
If you have taken her,
you will give her back.
Give her back...
Give her back, please. Please.
I expected fate to put
up more of a fight, eh?
I will not have that smile on
your face as I strike you down.
Take a gander, Edward Teach.
This land is hereby forever
claimed in the glorious name
of His Majesty King George...
Someone make a note
of that man's bravery.
Señorita, the chalices, por favor.
Only God can grant eternal
life, not this pagan water.
Men, destroy this profane temple!
The Fountain!
You are a fool.
You seek in this place
what only faith can provide.
Faith? In faith, there
is light enough to see
but darkness enough to blind.
What devilry is this?
- For the Pearl.
- What have you done?
Angelica! Don't! It's poison!
I'm not such the fool
to take on Blackbeard
without a little venomous advantage.
Jack!
I claim Blackbeard's ship and crew,
and this sword, payment
for my missing limb!
Hang on! Pull!
Do not waste my tear.
Drink this. This one has the tear.
- You must drink the other.
- No!
I cannot save you both.
One of you must sacrifice.
You take it, Father, for your soul.
Captain Teach, she's dying.
You must save your daughter.
This one takes life?
This one has the tear and gives life?
Aye, hurry!
Angelica... Save me, my child.
No.
I love you, Father.
Wait a minute.
In fact, it might have
been the other way around.
This cup had the tear,
that one had the other bit.
Trickster!
- Devil!
- Father!
You bastard! How could you?
Your father saved you.
Perhaps his soul is now redeemed, eh?
You are hurt.
In body only.
My mind is at peace... because of you.
- Me?
- Yes.
I was lost.
The wind, the tides...
...they ought to renew a man's faith.
But for me, only you.
Philip, I can save you.
You need only ask.
- I seek but one thing.
- What is that?
Forgiveness.
If not for me, you would
never have been captured.
Ask.
Forgive me?
I hate you.
The bloke who saved your life?
The years I possess,
stolen from my own father!
I only helped Blackbeard do
what any father should have done.
You are cruel and ignorant.
One pistol, one shot.
To kill myself before I starve?
There's no trusting you, love.
Besides, this is a
well-traveled trade route.
You can signal a passing ship.
Or you can just bite the
proverbial bullet, as it were.
And how will I get free of these bonds?
You broke free of your
bonds half an hour ago,
waiting for the precise
moment to pounce.
Admit it, Jack.
- You still love me.
- If you had a sister and a dog,
I'd choose the dog.
Treasure! There is a chest with jewels!
Jewels with the power to
rule the wind and tide!
- You're making that up!
- Wait...
I am with child. Yours.
I don't recall that we ever had...
- You were drunk!
- I've actually never been that drunk.
Wait!
There is something I want to say to you.
Something I wanted to say
from the moment we first met.
Go on, then.
I love you.
As do I.
Always have. Always will.
I gotta go.
Jack!
This is not over!
Jack!
Missed!
The Revenge is mine.
Sir...
We found this below decks.
All hands! Ply to windward!
Get cracking, ye blooming cockroaches!
The Crown served me well.
But now, by the gods of sea and sky...
...make way for Tortuga!
Gibbs, you filthy, besotted
shellback, you made it!
Aye!
And I trust we managed a profit
- from our joint enterprise?
- Feast your eyes.
The compass led me straight and true.
What of Blackbeard's
men guarding the ship?
I employed the selfsame maneuver
we perfected in New Guinea.
Seemed a shame to leave
an entire fleet behind.
Shame indeed.
I hate that monkey.
So, the Pearl... Any
idea how to get her out?
We shall need a crossbow,
an hourglass, three goats.
One of us must learn to play the trumpet
whilst the other one goes like this...
- I know a man with a goat.
- Good. I can go like this.
Jack, I have to ask...
You had the chalices,
the water, the tear...
You could have lived maybe forever.
The Fountain does test you, Gibbs.
But better to not know which
moment may be your last.
Every morsel of your entire being
alive to the infinite mystery of it all.
And who's to say I
won't live forever, eh?
Discoverer of the Fountain of Youth.
I have no say in it, Gibbs.
It's a pirate's life for me.
Savvy?
