[MUSIC STOPS]
-Hi, Mom.
-Don't "Hi, Mom," me.
What are you still doing up? It's past 1 .
Just thought l'd wait for you.
Well, I'm home.
Now you can get to sleep.
Come on, Ã¡ndale.
Mom, I'm really not tired.
Kristen, don't start with me.
You know what your shrink said.
He's full of it.
I'm not gonna let you get me
into an argument, not tonight.
Now get to sleep.
Mom...
...I'm still having those awful dreams.
MAN:
Elaine, where do you keep the bourbon?
Uh, I'll be right down.
-Honey, l've got a guest.
-And you don't wanna keep him waiting.
That's right, I don't.

Hi, what's your name?
Kristen. What's yours?
[GIGGLES]
What is this place?
[SCRAPlNG]
I gotta go now.
Wait, little girl, don't go in there!
Little girl!
Little girl?
[BIKE BELL RINGING]
This is where he takes us.
Come on, we're going.

[GROANS]
REPORTER [ON RADIO]:
ln local news...
...two more teenage deaths have occurred.
Both suicides.
County health officials are at a loss
to explain this alarming trend.
Nothing like a little cheery news
to start the day, huh?
Yeah. Say, listen, doc.
I got a new theory
about all these suicides, right?
Don't hold back on us, Max,
we need all the help we can get.
Yeah, well, it's fucked up
chromosomes, man.
Think about it, all their parents
dropped acid during the '60s.
It beats Simms' theory.
She thinks it's nothing
but sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll.
-Shit, that's what keeps people alive.
-Heh.
Hi, Taryn.
You don't look so hot, kid.
Are you getting some sleep?
-I didn't think so.
-Good morning, Dr. Gordon.
Good morning, Jennifer.
How are the burns?
-Regular, menthol, ultra-light.
-They're healing up nicely?
Yeah, I've been good.
So, um, when do l get
my cigarette privileges back?
Don't hold your breath.
-Phillip.
-Hey, doc.
-How is he?
-He's cooling down.
If he continues having these outbursts,
I'll have to have him isolated permanently.
Aw, don't worry, it won't come to that.
I, uh-- I read the report
on the new staff member.
Oh, what did you think?
Frankly, I don't understand...
...why some grad-school superstar
is being treated like a seasoned pro.
She's been doing groundbreaking research
on pattern nightmares.
Elizabeth, we don't need any outside help.
I know these kids.
I don't want some hotshot taking chances
with them just so she can get published.
MAN [ON INTERCOM]:
Dr. Gordon, Dr. Simms to Examination, stat.
Dr. Gordon, Dr. Simms
to Examination, stat.
[KRISTEN SCREAMING]
This is ridiculous.
I know my own daughter.
She's trying to get attention, that's all.
And I'm not gonna play her games with her.
Suicide attempt from County General.
-What's her name?
-Kristen Parker.
She was fine until we tried to sedate her.
[CONTINUES SCREAMING]
Watch it, she tore her stitches out.
Kristen, we wanna help you.
-Hold her, hold her.
KRISTEN: Aah!
No, no, no.
I'm Dr. Gordon.
I'm not gonna hurt you, I wanna help you.
-Why don't you--?
-No!
SIMMS:
Be careful, Max.
Back off, Max.
Kristen, put the scalpel down.
Nobody is gonna hurt you.
Five, six
Grab your crucifix
Seven, eight
Better stay up late
Nine, ten
Never, never--
Never sleep again.
Where did you learn that rhyme?
Tell me about the kids.
Well, they're survivors in a way.
They're all severely sleep disordered.
Insomnia, narcolepsy, bed-wetting.
-But the nightmares are the common thread.
-Right.
They seem to share a group delusion,
a bogeyman, for lack of a better word.
They're so traumatized,
they'll do almost anything not to sleep.
Anything?
We lost a kid about a month ago
to Fairview.
I don't know where he got the razors,
but he cut off his eyelids to stay awake.
-Oh, God.
NEIL: Shook the kids up pretty badly.
Oh, by the way, that was really great work
with the new patient.
Pretty smooth for an intern.
I have had some experience
with pattern nightmares.
-I've got to get going.
-Okay, well....
Let me help you with that.
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.
Now, uh, be sure
that you check in with Max...
...and he'll give you
the whole 25-cent tour and everything.
-All right, I'll see you later.
-All right.
Oh, um, Miss Thompson?
-You can call me Nancy.
-All right.
You call me Neil, all right?
What was that nursery rhyme all about?
That was just something that the kids say
to keep the bogeyman away.
Anyway, that's group therapy.
This whole wing is devoted
to the program. Um....
I guess, yeah, you can use this office
for the time being, okay?
-This will be fine.
-All right, great.
Because I'll have you set up
in your own space by the end of the week.
Um, the patients' rooms
are down this way.
This is Phillip.
We call him "The Walker."
-Why is that?
-Because I sleepwalk.
Perfectly normal event...
...that our illustrious staff loves
to theorize about endlessly.
Phillip, this is Nancy.
Hi, welcome to the snake pit. Heh.
Thanks.
Nice work.
They really ought to be carved out of wood,
but they won't let me have a knife.
I might, you know, pfft!
Um, this lump over here, this is Kincaid.
Now, I want you to take a good look.
He gets thrown in the quiet room so often,
you probably won't see a lot of him.
Ain't that right, cool breeze?
Right, I do it so I don't have to look
at your ugly face all the time.
Yeah, I love you too.
Nice meeting you.
Yeah, they're really good kids
but, uh, don't let them fool you.
They're dangerous,
to themselves and to each other.
Hi, Joey.
Why, thank you.
-Hey, Marcie, how you doing?
-Great.
-These going to C Ward?
-Yeah.
Come on, I'll walk you down.
See you later, Joey.
Mrs. Parker,
was Kristen acting any different?
Did you notice anything strange
before she made the attempt?
Kristen specializes in strangeness.
I've spent thousands on psychiatrists.
Did she always have nightmares?
No, they've gotten worse
since I took away her credit cards.
I'm serious.
Miss Thompson, I don't know
what you want from me.
Just some answers.
There are other kids involved,
not just Kristen.
All good kids, smart kids.
Look, I'm sorry to hear that
but you're the experts on this, not me.
If I had any insight into any of this,
I would share them with you, believe me.
I'm sure you would.
If you'll excuse me,
I have to get downtown.
I'll need to get her things.
I have them packed in a suitcase.
Theresa!
I'll get them, please, l don't mind.
It's the first door at the top of the stairs.
[METAL SQUEAKING]
[BIKE BELL RINGING]
[SCREAMING]
[FLIES BUZZING]
[SNARLS THEN KRISTEN SCREAMS]
[CREAKlNG]
[SCREAMING]
Nancy!
KRISTEN:
Nancy!
[KRISTEN SCREAMING]
No!
[FREDDY ROARING]
-You.
-Oh, my God.
Run!
Get us back out, Kristen, do it now.
Aah!
I used to live in this house.
That's just a house I dream about.
Have you ever done that before,
pull someone into your dream?
When l was a little girl, like 4 or 5...
...if I had a nightmare,
I would always bring my dad in.
The dreams would always get better.
He used to tell me about it the next day.
He used to think they were his dreams.
-Ha, ha.
-And when did that stop?
When l was still a kid.
My folks got divorced.
And after a while, I just thought
I imagined the whole thing.
I guess I didn't.
It's an amazing gift.
The man in my dreams,
he's real, isn't he?
He's real.
Okay, group's in session.
Straight talk only in this room.
Today, I'd like to start
getting us acquainted...
...with our new staff member,
Nancy Thompson.
Let's make her all welcome.
MAN: Hi, Nancy.
-Hi.
-Hi, Nancy.
-Hey, Nancy.
Now, you've already met Phillip and Kincaid
and, of course, Kristen.
How about the rest of you all tell Nancy
something about yourselves?
Will, how about you first?
Hi, I'm Will Stanton and, um,
I've had a little accident, as you can see.
Ended up in this chair.
Accident, my ass.
I thought this was supposed to be
straight talk in here.
Hey, so he took a jump.
At least, he wasn't sticking needles
in his arm with a bunch of lowlifes.
Save it, Kincaid.
-Jennifer?
JENNIFER: Um, ahem.
I'm Jennifer Caulfield.
And, um, as soon as I get out of here,
I'm going to Los Angeles to be an actress.
I'm gonna be on TV.
Yeah, Lifestyles of the Rich
and Psychotic.
Screw you.
[KIDS LAUGHING]
This is Joey.
He used to be a debater in school,
but now he doesn't talk much.
TARYN:
I'm Taryn White.
The only reason l'm in here is because
it's a better deal than juvie hall...
...also, because I'm going
through some very strange shit.
Your dreams?
Hey, everybody has bad dreams.
Can I interject something here
just to save us all some time?
NEIL:
Sure, Phillip, go ahead.
Well, according to our kind hosts...
...our dreams are a group psychosis,
sort of a mellow mass hysteria.
The fact we dreamt about this guy before
we met doesn't seem to impress anybody.
KINCAID: Yeah.
TARYN: That's right.
So we go in circles, making minimal
progress with maximum effort.
You won't make any progress until you
recognize your dreams for what they are.
And what are they?
The by-products of guilt.
Psychological scars, stemming
from moral conflicts and overt sexuality.
Oh, great,
now it's my dick that's killing me.
[KIDS LAUGHING]
TARYN: Tell me what's supposed
to be happening again.
Okay, you're being attacked
by the bog demon. Go ahead.
[CLEARS THROAT]
-Uh, 14.
-Doesn't count.
You got to say the words.
This is stupid.
Oh, come on.
In the name of Lowrek, Prince of Elves,
demon, begone.
Good, you conquered the demon
but your horse is sinking in the bog.
What do you do?
I go to bed...
...and get a new horse in the morning.
Well, how do I score that?
Enchanted slumber or death?
All right, fellas, lights out.
-Oh, Max.
MAX: "Oh, Max."
You know the rules.
-Yeah.
-Come on, Joey, you too.
Every time we get a good game going...
-...it's always lights out.
-Mm-hm.
Okay.
-Good night, fellas.
-Good night, Max.
Okay, you get first shift tonight.
Oh, come on, I had it last night.
Good, just remember,
keep your eyes open.
And one whimper
and you wake me up, okay?
-This is nice.
-You've never been here before?
No, um, l think they opened this
when I was at school.
Best Thai food in Springwood.
Of course, it's the only Thai food
in Springwood.
Uh, do your parents still live around here?
My mother passed away.
She, uh, died in her sleep.
I'm sorry.
My father and I, um--
Well, things just seemed to fall apart
after that.
Sounds like a rough time.
It was.
Neil, what if I told you...
...that, um, your patients are in real physical
danger from their dreams.
The nightmares are nothing but a symptom
of the real problems.
All right, well, then let's just eliminate
the symptom for the time being.
-With Hypnocil?
-That's right.
You want me to prescribe...
...an experimental psychoactive drug
to a bunch of suicidal teenagers?
Just until we get things under control.
Dream deprivation is nothing
to fool around with.
You have no business taking it yourself.
I used to be like them, Neil.
I know what they're going through.
So do I.
You told me they were survivors
and they all are.
But how much longer they survive
is up to us.
I'm sorry, Nancy.
The answer is no.
-Shh.
-Ah--!
[GROANING]
[FREDDY LAUGHING]
[PHILLIP GROANING]
Phillip.
Phillip, wake up.
Have a nice stroll, asshole.
[GROANING]
What? What are you doing?
Hey, come on, man.
What, are you crazy?
Oh, shit, what is he doing?
Get help! Get help!
Phillip! Phillip!
Phillip, no!
Joey?
What's the matter?
WILL:
Phillip! Phillip!
Phillip! Phillip, no!
Phillip, no!
Don't do it, no!
Phillip, don't do it! Phillip!
Goddamn!
Phillip!
-Phillip!
-Phillip!
[ALL SCREAMING]
-Phillip!
-Phillip!
-Don't jump!
-Phillip, don't jump!
[GROANING]
KRISTEN:
Phillip!
-Don't you jump!
-Aah!
[PHILLIP YELLING]
[LAUGHING]
[CRYING]
I want us to talk
about what happened last night.
I want us to all get our feelings out
in the open.
He wasn't strong enough
so he got wasted, that's all.
That's all? Is that what you think?
He couldn't hack it
so he got nailed, period.
Oh, yeah, big, tough bad ass.
How long are you gonna last?
I'm gonna last longer than any of you.
Well, just go ahead and fight
because that's what he wants.
-Who?
-Who do you think?
What does he want?
To turn us against each other
so we'll be weak, easy prey.
KINCAID: Horse shit.
-No, she's right.
I think we're all missing the point here.
Phillip's death was
a sleepwalking accident, nothing more.
No.
I could see him up there.
His face--
He was wide awake all the way down.
Well, then it was suicide.
Phillip quit, he gave up.
Joey says it wasn't suicide.
Listen to me, Joey, Phillip killed himself.
Now, that's a cowardly thing.
That's an empty thing.
He let himself down.
He let all of us down.
It was murder.
Can't you understand that?
That bastard murdered him!
I'm not gonna listen to any more of this.
How much longer are you going
to go on...
...blaming your dreams
for your own weaknesses?
-How much longer you gonna keep throw--
-That's enough, Kincaid.
There will be no repeat occurrences
of last night's events.
From now on your doors will be locked
during sleeping hours.
We'll start a policy of evening sedation
for everybody.
The fuck you will. Anybody who tries
drugs on me, gets his ass kicked.
You just bought yourself a night
in the quiet room, mister.
-Now, sit down.
-Fuck you, you sit down.
-Easy, Kincaid.
KINCAID: Nobody is gonna put me to sleep.
Get away from me. Leave me alone.
I don't wanna go to sleep.
Nobody gonna put me to sleep.
Get your hands-- I ain't gonna sleep.
Stay in your seats.
KINCAID:
Get your hands off me, I don't wanna--
We'll begin sedation tonight
starting with him.
You can't. They'll be defenseless
against their dreams.
That's precisely what they need.
Some uninterrupted REM sleep
to release all that negative energy.
Elizabeth, l'm prescribing Hypnocil.
It's a dream suppressant.
I know what it is.
I just can't believe what I'm hearing.
-What has she talked you into?
-Nothing.
My patients, my decision.
I want these dreams stopped
till we get some answers.
I can't allow that.
Then I'll go straight to Carver
if I have to.
And he'll either back me up
or accept my resignation.
All right.
But if something goes wrong,
I'll make sure that you're held responsible.
I mean that. Fully responsible.
I can't believe I just said that.
Do you think we can get the Hypnocil
by tomorrow?
We're gonna try.
I hope you know
what you're getting us into.
[SINGING]
Ain't gonna dream no more, no more
Ain't gonna dream no more
All night long, l sing this song
Ain't gonna dream no more
-April!
-He shot me with a slingshot!
-l did not!
-Liar!
WOMAN: April.
GIRL: Liar.
MAN:
Hold it, hold it.
-Girl, what are you doing?
-Watching TV.
I can see that.
Why don't you read a book?
You watch too much damn TV.
Research.
Oh, right, you're gonna be a TV star.
Wait and see.
Yeah, well, if Simms catches you here
after lights out, she's gonna chew my ass.
-I got to stay up, Max.
-Jennifer.
Just tonight, please.
I can't handle the nightmare.
Not after Phillip, not tonight.
Okay.
But I never saw you.
-Thanks, Max.
-Okay.
BOY [ON TV]:
This is a great meal, Mrs. Brown...
...really one of the best l've ever had.
WOMAN:
Thanks, thank you, Steve.
[CHUCKLES]
Hi, sweet stuff, good news.
It can't be good news
coming from you.
I pulled night duty.
-So?
-So got the keys to heaven, baby.
-What?
-The dispensary.
I am talking clean pharmaceutical high,
a night at Club Meth.
-I don't do that shit.
-Yeah?
-What are those, beauty marks?
-Those are ancient history.
Oh, yeah?
Well, if you're ever in the mood
for a history lesson...
...I'm your teacher, understand?
Stay out of my face
or I'll go straight to Max.
Oh, yeah?
Now, who's gonna take the word
of a crazy junkie chick like you?
Fuck off!
[LAUGHING]
MAN [ON TV]: Hon, l kind of figured
you'd watch me bowl tonight.
We're defending the championship,
you know?
-Oh, we're--
WOMAN: Maybe we'll come by later.
Don't suppose anybody would
like some dessert before they leave.
GIRL: No, thanks, Mom.
MAN: No, it was very good.
-Thank you.
WOMAN: Thanks.
MAN: Helen?
WOMAN: Hmm?
MAN: Have you, you know,
talked to her about the way things are?
WOMAN:
Years ago.
MAN:
Years?
BOY:
What do l want to see an old barn for?
GIRL: Come on, it's romantic.
-Aah! Unh.
BOY:
Look, April.
GIRL:
You want your car keys back, don't you?
--silly thing to ask you, but how many
of what did they have to kill?
GABOR:
Don't say that because l love animals.
l've seen animal shelters.
I bought it only red with black in it,
so I didn't know what it was.
-Probably from an artificial bird.
GABOR: Ha.
CAVETT: Did you ever go
to any kind of acting school?
GABOR: Not in the beginning.
l started on a talk show.
When a young actress says,
"How do you succeed in this?"
-You don't always say study?
-Study.
I think you should study.
They have to study, work.
And then maybe you can make it.
-Can I ask you something?
-Certainly.
Who gives a fuck what you think?
[SCREAMS]
GIRL [ON TV]:
This is your break, Jennifer.
[DISTORTED SCREAMING]
One, two
Freddy's coming for you
Three, four
Better lock your door
This is your break, Jennifer.
This is your break, Jen--
[SCREAMING]
-This is it, Jennifer, your big break in TV.
-Aah!
-Welcome to prime time, bitch!
-Aah!
Don't be ashamed, young man.
This is a place for sorrow.
What faith do you follow?
Science, I suppose.
Sad choice.
There are times when it doesn't offer
much comfort.
I've seen you before, uh, Sister...?
Mary Helena.
You do volunteer work at the hospital.
From time to time, when l'm needed.
I should have been able to save them.
Only one thing can save the children.
The unquiet spirit must be laid to rest.
It is an abomination to God and to man.
NANCY:
Neil.
Excuse me, Sister.
What are you doing up here?
Uh, I was just talking to--
NANCY:
To who?
Doesn't matter.
-Are you ready to go now?
-Sure.
Are you finished?
Yeah, I'm sorry. I guess I, uh--
I'm not hungry.
That's okay.
That's pretty. What is it?
This is my Malaysian dream doll.
It's supposed to bring good dreams.
Could use some of that right about now.
You know, I used to think...
...I could do something for the kids,
make some kind of difference.
But they're slipping through my fingers,
every one of them.
You're doing the best you can
for them, Neil.
Am I?
I'm running out of answers.
A patient sleepwalks out
of a high-security ward.
A girl alone in a room dies.
I can't believe this is happening.
Nothing makes any sense.
Then maybe you're ready.
For what?
The truth.
Try me.
Only if you're willing to put aside everything
you've learned and trust me.
Can you do that?
I can do that.
Okay.
Straight talk only in this room.
Is this group?
Well, yeah, unofficially.
Pretty soon, there won't be enough of us
left to call it "group."
Okay, listen up, you guys.
Nancy has something to say.
I know who's trying to kill you.
Don't humor us.
We're not in the mood.
He wears a dirty, brown hat.
He's horribly burned.
He has razors on his right hand.
Who is he?
His name is Freddy Krueger.
He was a child murderer before he died.
And after he died...
...well, he became something worse.
Six years ago, he killed my friends.
He almost killed me.
Why is he after us?
Yeah, what did we do?
It's not you.
Your parents, my parents,
they burned him alive.
And now we're paying for their sins.
You are the last
of the Elm Street children.
WILL:
Mom and Dad?
I mean, that's crazy.
They never mentioned anything--
Oh, sure, that's the sort of thing
parents tell their kids.
"Good night, darling, say your prayers.
And, oh, by the way, your father and I
torched some maniac last night."
So what do we do about this creep?
Kristen is the key.
She has a very special talent, a gift.
I haven't been able to do that
since I was a little girl.
You did it the other night.
That was different.
NANCY: You never lose a gift like that.
You just forget how to use it.
How about it, will you try?
All of you have this inner strength.
Some special power that you've had
in your most wonderful dreams.
Together, we can learn to use that power
if we try.
You sound like Peter Pan.
Remember, open mind.
Okay.
Uh, Taryn, would you pull
the shades down please?
We're gonna try a little,
uh, group hypnosis.
I want you all to follow this pendulum
with your eyes.
Tune out everything else.
Nothing else exists but the pendulum.
Take us there, Kristen.
NEIL:
Breathe deeply and relax.
Starting with your toes, relax everything
till there's no tension left in your bodies.
Keep following the pendulum.
You find yourselves getting tired.
Nothing would feel better right now...
...than a nice, long, deep sleep.
I'm gonna count backwards from five.
When l finish...
...you will all be asleep.
Five.
Four.
Three.
Two.
One.
Sorry.
That's okay, we'll try again.
Everybody take five. Ahem.
I was willing to go through with this
for the kids' peace of mind and yours...
...but you're gonna have to face reality.
[WHEELS SQUEAKlNG]
[KIDS CHATTERING QUIETLY]
WILL: No, I'm serious, I happen to be
very susceptible to hypnosis.
-I've been told by professionals.
TARYN: What professionals?
Where are these professionals?
WILL: Well, "professionals" as in,
like, magic-users and illusionists.
Listen, Joey, I just wanted
to get you alone for a second.
I mean, look, I really like you.
Do you like me?
I know this sounds crazy...
...but I make up excuses to come
into the ward every day just to see you.
You're so cute.
Neil, let's just try one more time.
If it doesn't work, I promise I'll--
We're here.
Where here?
We're in the dream.
Well, no, we're not.
We're still here in the group.
In my dreams, I can walk.
My legs are strong.
In my dreams, I am the wizard master.
Try something, Kristen.
What can you do in your dream?
[ALL CHEERING]
A perfect score.
The crowd goes wild. Ahh!
-Ha, ha!
-Fucking A, dig this.
Kincaid, please.
That's very unnerving.
Hey, check out Taryn.
In my dreams, I'm beautiful...
...and bad.
Look, I could get
into a lot of trouble for this.
But I know you won't say anything,
will you?
Unzip me.
Do you like my body, Joey?
[GRUNTS]
[SNARLS]
[LAUGHING]
What's wrong, Joey?
Feeling tongue-tied?
[LAUGHING]
Aah!
What's happening?
-He's close.
-Who?
-Freddy?
-He's out in the halls.
-Where's Joey?
-Freddy's got him.
Aah!
Quiet, everyone, listen.
[LOW RUMBLING]
The room's changing.
What the heck is going on?
-Doctor--
-What's happening?
NEIL:
Get away from the wall!
[ALL YELLING]
Don't panic! Quiet down!
Aah!
Help! Help!
-This isn't real!
-Dr. Gordon!
-No!
-It's not!
Quiet, the door.
What's going on in here?
What's wrong with Joey?
Joey.
-Code blue.
-Oh, my God.
[MACHINE BEEPING]
He's in a deep coma.
There's nothing we can do for him.
This is inexcusable.
The session was unauthorized.
It was purposely conducted
without my knowledge.
Unusual steps were called for, Dr. Carver.
Is that what I should tell
that young man's parents?
I understand you prescribed
a highly experimental drug.
Dr. Carver, he's not in a coma
because of--
Young lady, your opinion
is of no interest to me.
Furthermore, according to Dr. Simms...
...you've been creating panic
among the patients.
-That's not true.
-Dr. Gordon.
In the last four days,
we've had two suicides.
Now that young man is in a coma.
I think it's safe to say that your approach
has failed, entirely.
You're both relieved of duty.
I want you out of here today.
I'm sorry, Neil.
I'm afraid you brought it on yourself.
For God's sake, Elizabeth, please.
Will you please just try to help the kids?
Will you listen to them?
Of course, I will.
What are we going to do?
There is nothing that we can do.
It's out of our hands.
Sister!
Sister?
Hello?
Sister?
This is where it began.
This wing has been closed for years.
What was this place?
Purgatory.
Fashioned by the hands of men.
Twisted, lonely souls.
The worst of the criminally insane...
...were locked up in here like animals.
This whole facility was shut down
in the '40s, wasn't it?
Some sort of scandal?
A young girl on the staff...
...was accidentally locked in here
over the holidays.
The inmates kept her hidden for days.
She was raped hundreds of times.
When they found her,
she was barely alive...
...and with child.
That girl was Amanda Krueger.
-Her child--
-Freddy.
The bastard son of a hundred maniacs.
Some say he was murdered...
...though no body was ever found.
You said something before
about laying him to rest.
You must find the remains...
...and bury him in hallowed ground.
Hallowed ground?
Sister?
If your only faith is science, doctor...
...it may be you that's laid to rest.
Wait! Sister!
Let go of him, you bastard.
Oh, my God.
NANCY: I've got to go in.
We don't have a choice.
Getting yourself killed
won't help the kids at all.
Besides, we do have a choice.
Well, assuming your mysterious nun
is right.
I've heard weirder things this week.
All right.
Whoever she is, she does seem to know
more about Krueger than I do.
The question is,
what happened to his body?
They burned him to death in his boiler room
and they hid the remains.
Who would know where they're hidden?
Well, only one man knows.
And it's time for him to talk.
No!
You can't take Nancy away from us!
You can't! She's all we have!
You're a sick girl, Kristen.
If you wanna get better,
you must trust me now.
[GRUNTING]
No!
-No, no!
-Take her to the quiet room and sedate her.
-Take it easy.
-You stupid bitch, you're killing us!
You're killing us!
No!
You're killing us!
No!
All right, everybody, back to bed.
KRISTEN:
No! No!
[ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]
Hi, Daddy.
Well, if it isn't my little girl.
My baby come to see her daddy, huh?
-It's been a long time.
-Yeah.
But you're here, sit down.
What did I do to, uh, get so lucky?
I thought
that you were trying to forget me.
That's not true.
You're the one who's trying to forget.
Oh, come on.
I need your help, Dad.
Krueger is back.
[CHUCKLES]
Fred Krueger is dead.
You always had a little trouble trying
to understand that, sweetheart.
You know what he did.
He's doing it again.
She's telling you the truth.
I don't believe we've ever met, friend.
And I don't think this is any
of your goddamn business.
I think we can stop him this time.
Stop him for good.
But we need to know
where his bones were hidden.
I've lost too much over this already.
I'm through with it.
People are still dying after all this time.
Stop running away from it.
You owe me.
It was nice seeing you again, princess.
Next time, don't stay away so long.
Nancy?
-Nancy.
-I'll be okay, just give me a minute.
[BEEPER BEEPING]
That's the hospital.
[PHONE RINGS]
-Dr. Gordon?
NEIL: Taryn?
You've got to come right away.
It's Kristen, she had a total shit attack.
Simms doped her up,
put her in the quiet room.
Simms put Kristen in the quiet room
for the night. They sedated her.
Oh, no.
She can't stay awake for long.
She's all alone in there.
Freddy is gonna get her.
Okay, none of you panic, just stay cool.
Help is on the way.
-Just hurry.
-Okay.
-We better get there now.
-You go, l gotta get the remains.
-It's no use. You see him.
-I'll talk, you get to the hospital.
-Make Simms understand.
-She'll never.
I got to get to Kristen somehow.
Nancy, be careful.
My name is Neil Gordon.
Pleased to meet you.
There, now we've met.
Now, listen to me!
I don't know if you care
whether Nancy lives or dies but I do!
You and I are going
on a little scavenger hunt.
Please, God.
Don't make me sleep.
What the hell are we doing here?
Hey. Hey!
I won't be long.
-What do you think you're doing?
-Uh--
Look, uh, sorry. Heh.
I really need this. I got, uh--
I'll reimburse you.
Here, you can keep my driver's license.
I'll be back.
[DINGS]
Max, I need to see Kristen.
You don't understand.
Look, Miss Thompson, save your breath.
Dr. Simms gave me specific instructions.
No one gets to see Kristen,
especially you.
But Max, she needs me, she's in danger.
You got to believe me.
Listen, I really think you mean well, I do.
But my kids have been dying off.
And even if l didn't have orders
from Simms...
...I wouldn't let you near her, no way.
Okay, Max, l understand.
-Can I say goodbye to the others?
-I don't know.
It will be my last chance.
Okay, you got five minutes.
They're in the TV room.
Where have you been?
We've been going crazy.
-Shh! There's no time for that, come on.
WILL: Where?
Our last group.
All right.
In there.
We knew nobody
would ever find it in that place.
I'm not sure I can find it myself anymore.
All right, it's deep in the heart
of the place.
Take it slow.
Straight talk only in here.
What about Kristen?
We can't get to her, I tried.
I was hoping we would have more time
to learn to use the dreams.
But Joey is in there.
And Kristen is going in with or without us.
They need us.
You mean, we're gonna try
to go in with her? To link up?
It's now or never.
I'm not gonna kid you.
This is as dangerous as it gets.
If you die in this dream, it's for real.
Nobody has to go in
that doesn't want to.
I'm in.
Me too.
Let's go kick the motherfucker's ass
all over dreamland.
-Yeah.
-Ha, ha.
So remember, we have to stay together
whatever happens.
It's the only way we can beat him.
All right, clear your mind of everything.
Picture yourself in the quiet room...
...the soft white walls,
the total silence.
Only the sound of your heart beating.
Picture yourself there with Kristen.
I'm gonna count backwards from five.
And when l'm done, we'll all be asleep.
We'll all be in the quiet room.
Five.
Four.
Three.
Two.
One.
Nancy, heh, l knew you would come.
You don't think we'd let you
go in alone, do you?
-No way, we are a team.
WILL: Yeah.
Listen, everybody, Joey needs us.
I can feel him.
Where is he?
How do we find him, Kristen?
[ALL YELLING]
NANCY:
Stay in the middle of the room!
No matter what happens, stay together!
KRISTEN: Help!
TARYN: Nancy!
Help me!
[DOKKEN'S "INTO THE FIRE" PLAYING]
lnto the fire
Honey, you're gonna wake up
the whole neighborhood.
[MUSIC STOPS]
What are you still doing up? It's past 1 .
I--
I just thought I'd wait for you.
Well, I'm home.
You can get to sleep now.
Come on, Ã¡ndale.
[LAUGHING]
What's that for?
I'm just glad you're home.
Mom, I had the most awful dream.
MAN:
Elaine, where do you keep the bourbon?
I'll be right down.
Kris, I've got a guest.
Please, Mom,
I just don't wanna be alone.
Aah!
-I said, where is the fucking bourbon!
-Mom!
You should listen to your mother.
Goddamn it, Kristen, you ruin everything.
Every time I bring a man home, you spoil it!
You know what your shrink says,
you're just trying to get attention!
[SCREAMING]
Nancy!
Kristen!
Is that you?
Welcome home, Taryn.
Look familiar?
Okay, asshole, let's dance.
[BOTH GRUNTING]
Taryn, Taryn, Taryn.
Why--? Why should we fight?
We're old friends, you and I, remember?
Let's get high.
[LAUGHING]
[GRUNTS]
[SCREAMING]
What a rush.
[TARYN SCREAMING IN DISTANCE]
Hello?
You guys, where are you?
Is somebody there?
[FREDDY LAUGHING]
[CLATTERING]
Oh, Will.
You look tired.
Have a seat.
No, thanks.
I'm fine just the way l am.
For now maybe.
But when you wake up...
...it's back in the saddle again.
My leg!
It's the chair for you, kid.
I am the wizard master.
I am the wizard master!
In the name of Lowrek, Prince of Elves,
demon, begone.
[GRUNTING]
Sorry, kid.
I don't believe in fairy tales.
[SCREAMING]
KRISTEN:
Hello?
Somebody?
Hello.
-Kristen!
-Nancy! Aah!
[WOOD CRUNCHING]
-What is that?
-I don't know.
Yo, I thought I heard voices.
Kincaid, I could kiss you.
-What's stopping you?
-Mm!
Cool. So where's Joey?
I don't know.
This place is like a maze.
Then it's time to stop guessing
and start messing.
Yo, Freddy!
-Where you hiding, you burnt-face pussy?
-Hey, we should find the others first.
You think you're hot shit with a mute kid,
don't you?
Well, let me see you come get
a piece of me.
Krueger! Pussy!
I knew he was a little chicken.
[BANG]
Shit.
NANCY:
It's a door.
KINCAID:
But it doesn't go anywhere.
Yes, it does.
NANCY:
This is it.
Are you ready?
Let's snuff the sucker.
That's it.
The Caddy.
Going somewhere?
Look, I said I'd show you
where the goddamn thing was.
-I never said I'd stick around.
-We've got work to do.
-What are you talking about?
-You're about to attend a funeral.
One that's long overdue.
Joey!
[HIGH-PITCHED SCRAPING]
[LAUGHING]
Joey.
Look, all the little piggies come home.
Let him go, Krueger!
Your wish is my command.
-No!
-Joey!
[ALL GRUNTlNG]
[LAUGHING]
Nancy.
He's strong.
He's never been this strong.
Yes, sir.
The souls of the children
give me strength.
-No.
-Unh.
[ALL SCREAMING]
Always room for more.
-What's that?
-What?
[CLATTERING IN DISTANCE]
Listen.
Somebody else is out here.
No.
We're alone.
[ENGlNE CHUGGING]
[HORNS HONKlNG]
Bury the fucking thing!
Agh!
It's really you.
I killed you once before,
you son of a bitch.
[GRUNTING]
[YELLS]
[LAUGHING]
NANCY:
Let's try this way.
Kristen, can you pull us out?
They sedated me. We're stuck here.
It's a dead end.
What the hell?
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Perhaps if there was more of me
to spread around.
[LAUGHING]
[SCREAMS]
[YELLlNG]
[SHOUTING]
No!
Wow, did I say that?
-You found your dream power, man.
KRISTEN: You saved us, Joey.
-Man, you blew him away.
-Put me down, man.
-Are you okay?
-I think so.
He's gone.
It's over. Ha, ha.
THOMPSON:
Nancy.
Daddy?
I've crossed over, princess.
Crossed over?
I couldn't go without telling you
how sorry I am for all the things I've done.
I love you so much.
I'll always love you.
[SCREAMING]
Die.
[SCREAMING]
Nancy.
[GRUNTS]
You're mine now, little piggy!
-No!
-Unh, agh!
[GRUNTING]
Please, God, for the children,
for Nancy.
Ashes to ashes.
[SCREAMING]
Dust to dust.
May the spirit rest.
[MOANS]
I won't let you die. I won't let you.
I'm gonna dream you
into a beautiful dream...
...forever and ever.
[MOANING]
Trust in him at all times, O people.
Pour out your hearts to him,
for God is our refuge.
Hear my cry, O God.
Listen to my prayer.
From the ends of the earth, I call to you.
I call as my heart grows faint.
Lead me to the rock
that is higher than I.
For you have been my refuge.
A strong tower against the foe.
I long to dwell in the tent forever and
take refuge in the shelter of your wings.
Even though we entrust Nancy to the earth,
her courage and spirit shall remain with us.
For the Lord, God,
has comforted us saying...
...that whoever finds his life
will lose it....
...and whoever loses his life for my sake
will find it.
They shall live forever
in the glory of his kingdom.
May the Lord bless you and keep you.
May the Lord make his face to shine
down upon you and be gracious to you.
May the Lord turn his face
toward you and give you peace.
My God.
You were his mother.
