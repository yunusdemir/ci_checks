<i>The summer wind</i>
<i>Came blowin' in</i>
<i>From across the sea</i>
<i>It lingered there</i>
<i>To touch your hair</i>
<i>And walk with me</i>
<i>All summer long</i>
<i>We sang a song</i>
<i>And then we strolled that golden sand</i>
<i>Two sweethearts</i>
<i>And the summer wind</i>
<i>Like painted kites</i>
<i>Those days and nights</i>
<i>They went flyin' by</i>
<i>The world was new</i>
<i>Beneath a blue umbrella sky</i>
<i>Then softer than a piper man</i>
<i>One day it called to you</i>
<i>I lost you</i>
<i>I lost you to the summer wind</i>
<i>The autumn wind</i>
<i>And the winter winds</i>
<i>They have come and gone</i>
<i>And still the days</i>
<i>Those lonely days they go on an on</i>
<i>(woman) Hi, Charlie. It's 3.30.</i>
<i>I'm taking Beth's four o'clock class
cos she's got an audition.</i>
<i>Sorry I won't be able to make your dinner.</i>
Hey, do me a favour, don't cook.
<i>- Jesus.
- Be good.</i>
<i>That never end</i>
<i>My fickle friend</i>
<i>The summer wind</i>
<i>The summer wind</i>
<i>Warm summer wind</i>
Where the hell you been?
Frankie.
How come nobody keeps me waiting
when they're lookin' to borrow it?
- You don't want it? You don't want it?
- Gimme the money. Gimme the money.
- We gotta stop meeting like this.
- Gimme the money.
<i>Yeah, grazie.</i>
- Ronnie, I'm sorry.
- Paulie came in late too.
- Paulie came in late?
- So I been short a waiter.
He's your cousin,
but he pushes it to the hilt.
- Hey, tell me about it.
- I been taking reservations half the day.
Christ, don't people know
how bad the food is here?
Ladies' room toilet
overflowed during lunch.
To top it off, the old man's upstairs.
He's got a bug up his ass this big.
- Claims he's bein' robbed blind.
- What else is new?
He's not bullshittin'.
He's checking the waiters' dupes.
He's checking the dupes tonight?
You tell Paulie?
I already told Paulie.
The party is over for a while.
And you're the guy on the line with him.
- Has Nicky been in yet?
- He's late, like everybody else.
Oh, and the machine's been
out of Marlboros for a week now.
And J3 on the jukebox sticks.
And this bimbo broad
you're gettin' started with,
this is Johnny Mack's private stock.
Who's getting started?
Huh? What am I doin'?
What did I do?
Is Paulie here?
<i>(band plays "New York, New York")</i>
- Will you give me a break?
- I'm comin', I'm comin'.
- Hey, Paulie, now. Come on.
- You got it.
<i>That's good, Charlie. Minchia,
the house had some nice week here.</i>
$195. What do you want for yourself?
- Let me grab 15 for a cab fare.
- You got it.
- Paulie make his payment?
- Paulie who?
Anything I can get for you?
My name is Paulie. If you need anything
you will call me, yes? Absolutely.
- Hey, what number came in today?
- Brooklyn number? 417.
- What did you have? 325?
- No, I had 417.
- Not with me, you didn't.
- 325.
- You got it.
- Billy.
Walter, any time on table six.
You OK with your Shylocks out there?
I got a few, if you need it, man.
Ronnie warn you about the old man?
Paulie, it's serious.
Cut that out, you Argentine degenerate.
That's my cousin's ass you're rubbin'.
That's family. This ain't some filthy
little jail in Caracas. It's Amer-ii-ca!
- Where the hell are my clams?
- Can we have some fuckin' plates?
Come on!
Keep quiet. Shut up. Just eat, huh?
<i>Patty, enjoy the scarol'. Vito, dig in.
Everything is taken care of. Alla salute.</i>
<i>- Salut'.
- Salut'.</i>
You like the steak?
Who's got the big table?
- Maybe Paulie.
- Maybe Paulie.
- Walter's half whacked.
- Walter the cook?
Walter the cook? You know
another Walter in the place?
- Somebody fed him vodka.
- What's wrong with this?
Ah, he ordered Beefeaters. Says it ain't.
Nobody would do that.
Who'd give that boozer a drink?
All the waiters know better. Of course,
I can't vouch for the busboys.
The big party on table eight?
- Let me see the check.
- I got that ticket, man.
- Let me see it.
- What for?
Cos you're running a contract
and half the dishes aren't on the check.
No? We'll borrow a thousand apiece
from Frankie Shy and bet it on the check.
If you got more than six entrées
on it, you win. I count, uh...
I count 12 entrées... I count 12 entrées
on that table, three of them steaks.
I'll go you double or nothin' if you got
a single fuckin' steak on that check.
Careful on that double or nothin',
Charlie. You'll lose your ass on that bet.
Gimme the book.
Hey, Charlie, you were in. Hey, man,
I'm serious. You were in for a ten-spot.
Six entrées. Six entrées, huh?
You're a greedy bastard. You know that?
- You're a greedy bastard.
- I had you figured for a sawbuck.
A sawbuck? To tide me over
when the old man fires me?
Relax. That old asshole
won't know a thing.
Plus you fed the cook vodka
to get your food out without dupes.
Another hour, he'll go face-ass down
into a bowl of scaloppine.
I'm gonna have to go behind
the range, blow another $80 shirt.
That ought to be enough
so you stop screwin' me.
Screwin' you?
I wasn't screwin' you, Charlie.
- I had you figured for a sawbuck.
- I don't want a sawbuck, all right?
I want my job. Cousin or no cousin,
that's the last check you rob. Capeesh?
- Capeesh. I understand.
- You understand me? I'm serious now.
Fix your tie. Fix your tie.
You're such a fuckin' slob.
- This good?
- Go.
- Do you have my charge tips?
- No. I'm not done yet, Waldo.
Mr Owner would like to see you
after you check out.
<i>- And you, you little prick...
- (Paulie sniggers)</i>
You stole my clams.
Hey, Paulie, don't play with him.
We're not gettin' rich
in this place, Charlie.
You'll never get your own
joint like this. Never.
- We're breaking our ass for nickels.
- Hey, will you let me check out, please?
Good night, Charles.
Charles?
<i>(under his breath) Charles.</i>
I'm out. On the street. He fired us.
They nailed you on that big check.
He should die. Die! Die, you old bastard!
<i>No, you should die.
Ronnie told you it was my job.</i>
Charlie. Hey, man.
<i>Hey, don't blame me for what that old
bastard done to ya. He fired you. Him!</i>
- Hey, let me out of here.
- We were starving in that shithouse.
Hey, why don't you grow up?
Why don't you just fucking grow up?
- Charlie.
- Charlie. What?
We were like a couple of victims in there.
You know, we could do better.
We could do a thousand per cent better.
Hey, man, don't think so small.
For once in your life,
don't worry about a lousy job, OK?
Don't worry about a job? What
the fuck should I worry about, huh?
I owe six stores,
I got two Shylocks to feed...
I got Shylocks too. You ain't alone here.
And those other assholes, the stores...?
You got no job now. They can't
collect no money off you.
Why can't you just admit you was wrong?
Why can't you say "I was wrong"?
- Wrong?
- Yeah, wrong.
Where was I wrong?
- What did you say?
- I said "Where was I wrong?"
Where was you wrong? Ronnie told you
not to rob. You robbed. That got me fired.
You was wrong.
You understand that? You were wrong.
I didn't figure I'd get caught. If I figured
I'd get caught, I'd be 1000 per cent wrong.
But if I didn't figure I'd get caught,
I wasn't jeopardising your job, man.
- Hey, don't you understand, Charlie?
- You fucking bastard.
- Hey!
- Keep your hands off me.
- Look what you did to my suit.
- I'm sorry.
What do you need a fancy suit for?
You got no job to wear it to, man.
- What did you say?
- Come on.
Huh? Say that again.
Say it again. Say it again.
Say... say what you just said again.
About my suit. Say what I don't need.
- Tell me what I don't need.
- What do you need a fancy suit for?
You got no job to wear it to, man.
That's right. Why?
Here's your button.
Come on, man. Hey, man, let's go watch
the sun come up like the old days.
Hey, Charluccio.
We'll sit and have a couple
of cognacs, like gentlemen.
Hey, let me tell you something.
I don't have time to sit
and watch the sun come up.
Capeesh? I don't have time.
I could teach another aerobics class.
There's some models
trying out for a commercial.
It would mean a few
extra dollars next week.
Great. Oh, Wallach's wants 300, or they're
gonna give it to a collection agency.
We can cut back a little too.
We eat out a lot more than we have to.
- You gonna cook?
- I can cook.
You can cook. You can't cook.
I don't fuckin' believe this.
She's got 11 months
worth of parking tickets here.
- The fuckin' bitch.
- Who?
Who? Cooky. Who else? Cooky.
She's still got the Buick in my name.
Goddamn it.
Let her pay them. It's only fair.
How can you say "Let her pay"? Every
penny that she gets comes from me.
Jesus Christ! It's almost two grand.
She must be parking
on the fuckin' sidewalk.
Take the car back.
She got three brothers who belong in
a zoo. They'll start a war over that thing.
- So what are you gonna do?
- I'll manage.
So what are you talking about, then?
Why you bein' such a cooze, huh?
Was that an accident?
Huh? Was that an accident?
- I don't think so.
- Jesus Christ.
Why did you do that?
I'm sorry.
You can hit.
Finding a job will pick you up.
- You'll get your reflexes back.
- I think I already have my reflexes back.

Hey, Charlie Moran. How the hell are you?
- How you doing?
- What's happening, baby?
- I'm not doing any good in there.
- You know anybody who does?
- So what's happening? How's Cooky?
- Cooky's history.
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right. Don't worry.
So, what's happening with you?
What are you doing?
- Waiting.
- You're waiting? For what?
- Work.
- I'm not gonna bullshit with you now.
I swear to God, business is off with me.
I'm down 35 per cent on my dinners.
You're up against a wall, I put you
on the floor a couple of shifts a week.
You work as a waiter, OK?
- Work as a waiter?
- Yeah.
- I look like a waiter to you?
- No. I'm offering you a job.
- You want to put me on as a waiter?
- Are you mad at me over this?
- I wouldn't work in your restaurant...
- Do me a favour. Go fuck yourself.
Fuckin' creep, you!
Maybe you should take a waiter's job
until somethin' better opens up.
Diane, give me a break, huh?
Just a thought.
You want me to save up
my little tip cup every night?
In 20 years, maybe I'll have
enough to own a place?
It's honest work, Charlie.
Somethin' I learned a long time ago
about honest work.
When people say they got honest work
for you, you know what they got?
- What?
- A shit job. That's what they got.
<i>Do you ever think we don't have to own
the restaurant to move to the country?</i>
You could find a job managing
a place. I could get work.
Diane, I'm not gonna head up
to Maine and start choppin' wood.
When we leave the city,
I'm gonna leave as an owner.
How are you gonna see your son
when you leave?
I'll work it out.
What's the sudden interest in my kid?
It's not sudden.
I'm curious. Doesn't it bother you
to only see Vinny once a week?
Yeah, it bothers me. Yeah.
It bothers me. When Cooky and I first split
up, I used to see the kid every other day.
I used to take him to the zoo.
I took him to the ferry.
- I dropped money at every Carvel stand.
- And?
And what? Then Cooky and her scumbag
brothers knocked me down all week long.
Bang, bang, bang. No mercy.
So by the time I got the kid,
I got nothin' but tight lips
and a frown all day.
<i>It might be different if it was our kid.</i>
Not at this point in my life.
I mean, you know.
You know, maybe down the road
sometime. But not right now.
Why not right now?
Because I got my back against
the wall right now. That's why.
I got no job. You want me
to put it a different way for you?
I'm outta work right now.
I got no money. Capeesh?
I got two Shylocks
I gotta carry on my back.
I got a marshal who wants to put a lien
on my salary, when and if I get a salary.
I got an ex-wife and I got a kid
I gotta feed every week.
<i>Listen to you. You're always
saying I. "I got to...</i>
Whoa, whoa! Don't play
games with me, all right?
- I'm not playing games.
- What do you wanna do? Fight?
- Shut up, dammit! Fuck off!
- Hey! What do you wanna do?
Look, I'm going to go begging
around the Village for a while, right?
I need a dose of sanity
in my life. Yeah, hey.
Charlie?
- Charlie!
- What? What do you want?
What do you want? What?
What do you want?
What? What do you want?
Speak. What do you want?
- I'm pregnant.
- Come over here.
Come over here. Come over here.
Come over here.
Come over here, right now.
Come over here, right now.
No, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't
come over here. Don't come over here.
<i>(Charlie) Grandpa had hundreds
of birds he kept up here on the roof.</i>
He had all different kinds.
He had tipplets, he had flights,
he had tumblers, he had nuns...
You know what nuns are?
They're pigeons.
He had one of the most beautiful flocks
in the whole Village up here in this coop.
They had pigeon wars over these birds.
Grandpa stood up here with a stick.
He went like this to bring the birds home.
Hey, Vinny. Most of your grandfather's
time here was spent cleaning up bird shit.
It was.
Hey, Vinny. Tell your old man to listen.
Cousin Paulie's got somethin' cookin'.
He'll thank me for gettin' us out of
that sentence we were servin' at Sal's.
- Hey, I wanna find my own job alone.
- Job?
<i>Job? Who's talkin' about a job?
I'm talkin' about a move, man.</i>
I'll pass.
How can he pass on somethin'
he don't even hear?
I don't know.
This is a score, man. Nice and easy,
and the guy I'm in with is a pro, Charlie.
An absolute pro, man.
Yeah? Well, you're an amateur, like me.
We're not professional thieves, Paulie.
Where you been? I'm waitin' an hour!
I gotta go shoppin'.
- Hey, Cooky, don't bust my balls.
- Come on, honey.
- Jesus Christ.
- Hey, Dad.
- Oh, wonderful, wonderful.
- Come on, honey.
She'll have you payin' taxes
if you're not careful, man.
They're all the same. They like you
to think small, you know?
A couple of weeks out of work,
you'll start thinkin' small too.
Tips, pay, plus what you robbed -
you were bringing home 600 a week.
Where you gonna find that, huh?
Where you gonna find that, huh?
- You take a girl out, you drop 100 bucks.
- Hey, more than 100, Charlie.
I mean, I like to look good, you know?
Lobsters, wine, a couple of sambucas...
When I drop 100 on my night off,
I figure I got away cheap, like I robbed 50.
Soon money ain't gonna be
no problem, Charlie.
- I got something big goin' for me, man.
- Oh, yeah? What?
I own a piece of a thoroughbred.
- A what?
- A thoroughbred.
A fuckin' racehorse, Charlie.
I'm in with Tommy Botondo
and Jimmy the Cheese Man.
Five thou apiece we went for.
- Where did you get 5,000?
- I went on the street for it.
<i>- On the street? What are you, stunato?
- Hey, man, we got a score set up.</i>
If you'd listen, money
ain't gonna be no problem.
Paulie, what do you or Jimmy
the Cheese Man know about horses?
I don't have to know nothin' in this deal.
I got in on a swindle with this horse.
This horse's father won
the Belmont Stakes, man.
Any horse wins the Belmont Stakes,
the yearlings go for maybe 600 big ones.
That's exactly it.
We got her for 15 grand, man.
It was like shopliftin', buyin' this horse.
Have you ever heard
of artificial inspiration?
It don't just work with people, Charlie.
See, horses can have babies
by artificial inspiration too, man.
Like, let's say you got a couple of horses
worth... a million dollars apiece.
You don't wanna set 'em loose
in some field to screw.
I mean, how many times you yourself
pull a muscle or somethin' screwin'?
And these great big stallions,
they get horny,
they could kick
the mother horse in the head.
- Ba-boom. You're out a million dollars.
- So what's the point?
- Point?
- Yeah.
Jimmy the Cheese Man got in with
the groom of this champion horse.
We got some of this champion's jism.
The groom jerked the horse off.
He beat his meat right in the stable.
Well, my horse's mother got some of it.
You bet horses.
You know what that means.
Her first race, Starry Hope
goes off at big, big odds, man.
Her papers say her father
was some no-dick piece of garbage,
but she got the champion gene, Charlie.
- Champion gene?
- Yeah.
Horses ain't like people. They can't
make themselves better than they're born.
See, with a horse, it's all in the gene.
It's the fuckin' gene that does the runnin'.
The horse got nothin' to do with it.
Let me ask you somethin'. How are you
gonna make your Shylock payments?
- Now, especially?
- Exactly like I told you, man.
With the nicest, easiest
score you ever heard of.
Charlie, at least meet the guy, OK?
You got nothin' to lose by lookin' it over.
There's a real deadline on this, Charlucc'.
Starry Hope runs in a couple of weeks,
and I need big bucks to bet with, man.
There's real money to be made
on that race, you know?
- You know, you ought to get a permit.
- A permit? For what?
To shit in the street. You look like a horse.
Paulie, are you sure this guy is all right?
That's Barney.
What are you doin'?
I fix clocks here in the Bronx.
Antique dealers downtown feed me work.
Chimes, mostly. You can make
a good livin' doin' nothin' but chimes.
- Chimes, man.
- Yeah, chimes. I get it.
- Can you still open safes?
- Some.
The kind we'll run into
on this job I can get into.
Yeah? What kind can't you get into?
- What kind?
- Yeah.
Banks. Big jewellery houses.
Anything wired up to Holmes.
I'm not a big-time safecracker.
I'm a hotshot locksmith.
People got a half million to protect
buy the kind of box I can't get into.
- Are you sure about openin' this one?
- If it ain't wired, I can get into it.
- Your buddy boy says it ain't wired.
- Guaranteed. I seen it, man.
You done any time, Barney?
Goes back to '47.
I did a pound at Green Haven.
Hey, what the fuck is this, huh?
What the fuck is this?
We givin' lifetime references here?
I did five years in the joint.
Five years. End of story, huh?
'47, Charlie.
Either of you guys have
an automobile out there?
- Yeah.
- Better hurry.
The summons man is out there
with his fleet of tow trucks.
Tow trucks! Shit!
He's the only police officer in this city
that sets the hook himself.
Hey! It's my car. It's my car.
- Hey, I'll move it, Officer.
- Lift her.
Hey! That ain't right and you know it, man.
Hey, Officer. I get here before you
hook me, you're supposed to let me go.
I get a ticket, but you're not
supposed to tow me.
- Take it away.
- Man, my fucking car.
Cocksucker!
That rat bastard was
supposed to let me go.
He doesn't let anyone go. He hooked
Monsignor Ryan's car last Saturday
while the Monsignor was sayin' eight
o'clock Mass. The man is possessed.
He should die of haemorrhoids.
It's gonna cost you $100
for the tow, plus $25 for the ticket.
And that fat bastard comes
in here every afternoon
to piss in my toilet
and drink my whisky free.
He knows there's two first-class
locks on that building.
Take me an hour to go through them. The
other one, I go through with a toothpick.
Crossing that alley to the other roof
is a piece of cake.
We go in, open the safe and find peanuts
in there, I'm gonna want your ass, Paulie.
Charlie! This is A1, guaran-fucking-teed,
man. Go on and sleep on it.
Before I go to sleep on it,
how sure are you of the 50 thou?
They deliver to some kind of small
chemical plant. COD. Payment in green.
And there's fifteen trucks out there.
- And it all goes in the safe?
- They get back too late for the banks.
Friday's receipts sit over the weekend.
We've been through this again and again.
<i>What is he, stunato?</i>
- What do you mean?
- He's like a wackadoo.
- Noodles and an egg roll. How much?
- What's the matter with you, Barney?
Hey, man, you'll die if you eat that shit.
This guy is sellin' instant hepatitis here.
It ain't nothin' but warm germs.
Charlie, we're gonna
lose our partner here, man.
<i>This u pazz' bought a horse.</i>
What's your story?
Come here, Charlie.
With these eyes, four more years,
they're gonna tell me to buy a shepherd.
I'm 58. I got a 25-year-old retarded
kid my wife won't let go of.
I've a two-family house,
a little left on the mortgage.
I might see some extra bucks each month
if the neighbourhood don't go coloured.
I need one nice score now,
so the kid's got somethin' goin' for him.
- One nice score.
- Right.
Absolutely.
Hey, Paulie, where the hell you
gonna keep that horse you bought?
- I thought you live on Carmine Street.
- At the racetrack, for Chrissake.
It ain't a fuckin' pet, Barney.
It's a racehorse, OK?
Hey, either one of you do any time?
What, are you nuts? Do I look like I could
afford to do any time? I'm no tough guy.
They send me in, some begunda will grab
me in the shower and "ram it up yo' ass!"
- Fuck that shit.
- It's no joke.
All this talk about doin' time
makes me nervous.
Are you in, Charlie, or what?
Is there gonna be money in that safe?
Yes, man. For the tenth time, yes.
- Barney, don't eat this shit. Give me this.
- Hey, come on. Stop. What the fuck...?
- It ain't good for you, Barney.
- I paid two bucks. Gimme the two bucks.
- Hey, Bunky.
- Hey, Nunzi.
Who's the guys?
The Chinks? They're OK.
They're with Eddie.
- How's the calamari?
- Mm.
Hey, Bunky. The fight next week -
you still got a hook-up for tickets?
- Yeah, but let me know how many.
- Tomorrow, I'll give you a call.
Will you give me a break
with that smoke?
<i>- What's the matter? No scungilli tonight?
- My stomach's a little sour.</i>
I wanna eat bland for a while.
You could have a wire that big
underneath all that sauce.
You're the cop. You're
supposed to be wired, not me.
No more, Eddie. Don't you
read the newspapers?
All the cops are gettin' pinched now.
Wise guys, they're too busy testifying.
You're right. Hey, everything
is upside down out there.
The whole world is upside down.
Listen, uh...
I hear you're havin'
a little trouble with Carlucci.
Put somethin' in your mouth, Bunky.
It's good.
The brass, they're gettin'
a little nervous. You understand?
We're sweetenin' up the pot this month.
You keep everybody calm.
There'll be 150 large there.
Make your usual pick-up
in your usual place.
- That's all that counts. No?
- You're right.
- I remember you. You're the guy...
- The guy who got his car towed.
- And you're Jinty.
- Ginty.
- That's what I said.
- What are you doin'?
Don't worry about it, Gint.
Here. Put that in your cup.
- Please God, you're not poisoning him?
- It ain't poison.
It's horse physic.
Hey, pour the ginger ale, man.
- It's what they give horses who can't shit.
- Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
How many envelopes do they give 'em?
One. One envelope will bust
a block of concrete, man.
Take a long time to work?
It ain't slow.
Encore.
Yeah. 1013.
Uh, Castle Hill and Westchester Avenue.
There's an officer down.
Officer needs assistance here.
Hurry, man, hurry. Yeah.
<i>(police sirens)</i>
Cop shit in his pants!
Cop shit his pants!
Shit his pants!
Yeah.
Cop shit his pants.
He's a cop. He's a cop. He's a cop.
He shit in his pants.
The cop shit in his pants!
It's nice. It's slightly run-down
and it needs a little paint.
It's nice.
It's nice.
It's old. I like that.
- Hello. How are you?
- I'll be with you in a minute.
Needs a buffing machine in the kitchen.
That's the first thing I'd do.
You've painted it
and taken care of the silverware...
Now all we need's a way to buy it.
It's still for sale.
Charlie, you've stopped
even lookin' for a job.
Listen, uh, after next week
I might make a real score.
I might not need a job.
Is Paulie part of it?
No.
- Really?
- Yeah, Paulie's part of it.
Hi. Uh, I hope you're not here to see
Linwood. He's gone for the day.
He's not here? No, we just
came up to have lunch.
- Would you tell Linwood we stopped by?
- Mm-hm.
- Beaujolais?
- Beaujolais. Beaujolais?
- Yes.
- Beaujolais. A full bottle.
- He's just got you fired.
- Maybe he's trying to make it up to me.
- When are you going to outgrow him?
- Outgrow him?
Diane, maybe Wasps outgrow people.
Italians, they outgrow clothes, not people.
- Hey, Nicky tells me you bought a horse.
- Who Nicky?
Nicky the Nose.
Says you bought a racehorse.
Well, not a whole horse, Pop.
There's three of us.
Now, look, listen, Paulie.
You're 28 years old.
Now, your mother's not doin' you
no favour by washing your laundry.
I mean, Rockefellers own racehorses.
Big-shot mafiosos own racehorses.
Waiters don't own racehorses, Paulie.
- You went on the street for the money?
- To Nappy. I took five large off him.
- How much did he bang you for?
- 200 a week in juice.
You got no gripe there.
But what if you can't pay?
Pop, you should see this horse.
She runs in a couple of weeks.
This horse is gonna make money, Pop.
In my bones, I feel it.
Paulie, God forbid, I don't wish you
any hard luck, but listen to me.
<i>I don't think you're gonna see even a little
piece of baccalá for this deal, you know?</i>
- Hey, Pop, it's better you don't smoke.
- Jesus Christ, I'm surrounded!
You know, Paulie, I should
have been a lot tougher with you.
My brothers hit their kids.
They're better off.
- Nicky the Nose is better off?
- He's got a house in Staten Island.
Pop, he's my first cousin,
but he's a total asshole.
Yeah? He trades in an Olds 98 every year.
<i>The Nose ain't even Napulitan',
for Chrissake.</i>
It's his mother's side all the way.
Genoese. He don't go for spit.
The Nose shines his own shoes,
Pop. That's no big success.
So what do you call success, eh?
Knowin' how to spend it.
I never ordered a brandy
in my life wasn't cordon bleu.
I took 500 from Shylocks, Pop,
to see Sinatra at the Garden.
Sat two seats away from Tony Bennett.
That's success, Pop.
Where is this interview
you're going to tonight?
Uh, it's around.
You're not going to an interview.
No.
You don't even bother
to lie to me carefully any more.
It's an insult to be lied to so obviously.
Diane, I'll tell you what. Tomorrow
I'm gonna turn over a new leaf,
and I promise you... my lies will be better.
Good. OK.
- Come on. Let's dance.
- We can't dance to that.
No, we can dance. Vinnie,
can we have some music?
You got it, Charlie.
<i>It's closing time</i>
<i>In this nowhere café</i>
<i>There's no way in the world
I'm gonna let that girl</i>
<i>Let her slip away</i>
Don't go.
- Don't go where?
- Wherever you're going.
How can you tell me not to go
if you don't know where I'm going?
It's a mistake, Charlie.
You're makin' a mistake.
This is it.
What do you guys think?
- What do you think?
- What do you mean, what do we think?
Top floor's a tough spot.
We gotta go by that like cats.
- Cats.
- Wait here.
<i>What do you think, Charlie?</i>
- He's a fuckin' mope.
- Fuckin' mope.
But he's careful. You know,
he seems to be prepared.
Prepared, yeah.
- What do you think?
- I think he's prepared. Absolutely.
<i>- No, what do you think?
- What do I think? Of what? An alley?</i>
OK, let's move it. Come on.
- Paulie, what is this for?
- Don't worry about it.
Make 'em look light, and walk into
the place like we own the joint.
What the hell is in these?
Tools, nice Genoa salami,
a couple of Thermoses of coffee.
He's got an appetite.
Three hours in there, you'll be starved.
- I'm busting my balls, really.
- OK, you take this.
- Ma, do I have a clean T-shirt?
- It's on the kitchen chair someplace.
You know, uh, Trusty Dream?
It's a four-year-old filly.
No.
She's in the third at Aqueduct. Six
furlongs. One-eleven in her last time out.
She must be a nice little place bet.
I like this horse.
- Want me to put your game show on?
- Nah, leave it alone.
I can't even think with those assholes
jumpin' up and down and screamin'.
Do I have a clean handkerchief, Ma?
It's in the drawer.
I like your haircut, sonny.
Glad I talked you into it.
At least go to the filters, huh, Ma?
<i>(she coughs)</i>
And those highballs
ain't doin' you any good.
A little whisky is good for the system.
It's not the cigarettes
that give me the heart attack.
It's 37 years scrubbin' floors
on my hands and knees
for those rich sons-of-bitches
on Park Avenue.
Do you remember haulin' garbage
after dinner, every night of your life?
Pullin' on a dumbwaiter rope?
- I know. Your right arm is bigger.
- Yeah, twice as big as my left.
Pullin' dumbwaiter ropes
up five-storey buildings.
Look, it'll protect you from
the muggers when I'm gone.
<i>(she chuckles)</i>
Aw, Ma, one more year.
One more year, Ma, and I'll have
my 20 in, and we'll head to Phoenix.
Clean air, sunshine. I'll even
teach you to play a little golf.
With that dumbwaiter arm of yours,
you'll drive the ball a mile.
And what will you do, Walter?
Liquor store.
Big house, hacienda style.
I'll even have a little dumbwaiter put in,
just to keep that arm of yours in shape.
And all this on a second-class
detective's pension?
- I got a little put away, Ma.
- That what your little recorder's for?
Keep track of your savings?
It's just a little personal protection, Ma.
In case things go sour.
I mean, this little box...
well, it gives me a hand to play with.
You know what I mean?
If things go sour, Walter,
I got nobody left.
I know, Ma.
Oh, get outta here.
Come on. Lock the door, huh?
Yeah, yeah. Go on.
- No, no, no. On your stomach.
- I look down, I'll freeze here for a week.
Oh.
- Come on.
- I don't work without a net.
- It's your idea, this whole thing.
- Oh, God.
All right, Charlie.
- Go ahead.
- Why me, man?
Why you? You're the monkey. You go. Go.
Hold me, Charlie. Hold me, man.
It's a tin can, all dressed up.
Good for fires.
- Got a couple of broads tucked in here?
- Cover the front, Paulie. Cover the front.
<i>- (phone)
- Barney, what's that?</i>
- It must be the phone.
- Hey, Paulie, give me a break, all right?
Barney, what is that?
Could be anything.
- Could be a wrong number.
- Absolutely.
<i>(phone stops ringing)</i>
<i>(tape recorder) There'll be 150 large there.</i>
<i>Make your usual pick-up in your
usual place. That's all that counts now.</i>
That was Bed Bug Eddie Grant.
It's September 21st.
11.25pm.
Headin' for my monthly
pick-up on West Street.
From there to Queens Village to deliver
the money to Inspector Ed Burns,
whose voice will be on this tape later on.
Hope to be erasin' this
in Phoenix, in about a year.
Did you ever see those big S&M fags?
They go into old buildings like this.
Charlie, that's somebody's personal
paper you're readin' there, man.
Big mothers, too. All dressed in leather.
These S&M fags get so carried away,
they beat each other up...
Paulie, will you please shut your mouth?
You're startin' to sound like half a fag.
Hey, man, somebody's comin'!
Somebody's comin'. Somebody's comin'.
Somebody's comin'.
- Get out of sight. Grab the cases, fast!
- Come on, Paulie.
- How many?
- One guy.
- Cop?
- No. Just a guy.
One of the bosses probably
forgot somethin'. Let me handle it.
- We'll bluff our way through.
- I gotta take a leak, man.
Shh. Be quiet.
Oh, fuck. The rope ladder.
Freeze! Freeze or I'll blow you away!
Aaah!
Shit.
- Oh, man.
- Barney, he's not movin'.
What are we standin' here for?
Let's get outta here.
If he's breathing, our best bet
is to go and call an ambulance.
- Crawl out from under a murder rap.
- Murder rap?
Nobody came within 20 feet of that yo-yo.
He dived into that hole like a gopher!
If somebody dies during a crime,
it's murder - end of story.
Barney, it's a dead cop down there.
- Aw, man.
- A cop? Shit.
- You got a lot of explainin' to do now.
- What?
Hey, Barney, what
the fuck are you doin'?
I'm a few seconds... It won't change
the rap one way or the other.
No!
I ain't leavin' this joint
with nothin' in my kick after all this!
I don't...
What the hell is a cop doin'
wanderin' in here after midnight?
- Shit, I don't know.
- You don't know? Hey, you bastard!
You know. You know!
Guaranteed it, you know, Paulie.
You know, you piece of shit.
Charlie, maybe he wasn't even a real cop.
Man, there must be 100 phoney cops out
there, shakin' people down and whatnot.
Charlie, Charlie.
- Charlie.
- Get off me, Paulie.
Jesus! The kid was right.
There's a hell of a lot of money here.
- The fuckin' lottery, Charlie!
- The fucking lottery?
There's a dead cop down there. What
are you talking about? You screwed us.
- You screwed us. You screwed me, man.
- I didn't screw you, Charlie.
He knows. Guaranteed, he knows.
And you're gonna tell me.
- There is nothing to tell, Charlie.
- Nothin' to tell, huh?
You're full of shit.
And you're so busy actin' stupid you got
us on FDR Drive with commercial plates.
You shoulda let me drive, Barney.
- Charlie.
- Paulie, shut up.
I gotta take a leak, man.
Charlie... I gotta take a leak, man.
Jesus Christ.
You know, he's got a bum bladder
ever since he was a kid.
Charlie, whatever your beef is
with him, you gotta forget it now.
We gotta find out the score.
Ooh, man.
Yeah, I know. I'm doin' it wrong.
With him, you gotta be calm, right?
Yeah.
Charlie, what are you doing?
Barney, talk to him. Get him back inside.
Fucking shut up! Paulie, come out here.
- Paulie, get the fuck out.
- Charlie! Charlie, the cops...
I wanna know what the fuck
is goin' on right now. Tell me.
- You're not telling me somethin'.
- I ain't holdin' back.
- Charlie, what are you doin'?
- Shut up! Tell me right now.
I ain't holdin' back nothin'. I swear.
I wanna know. I want answers.
I wanna know what's goin' on.
- I ain't holdin' back nothin'. I swear.
- Don't you lie to me.
- I swear.
- Swear on your kid brother, Vito.
Say "Vito should get stomach cancer
if I'm lyin' to Charlie." Say that.
- That ain't fair. Vito got nothin' to do...
- Say it.
"Vito should get slow stomach
cancer if I'm lyin' to Charlie."
Jesus Christ! Barney...
- Tell me.
- Vito should...
Jesus Christ! You don't
leave a guy no room.
Tell me. Tell me.
I didn't wanna bother you with every last
detail. There are things I can take care of.
Like what?
Huh? Like what?
<i>(mutters) Like about Eddie Grant.</i>
- Like what?
- You know, Bed Bug Eddie.
What about Bed Bug Eddie?
What's the use of kiddin' ourselves,
Charlie? That's his trucking company.
Paulie, what's wrong with you?
I don't...
What is wrong with you?
What is wrong with you? Huh?
What is wrong with you?
<i>(Paulie) What's the matter with
a score like we made tonight, man?</i>
You been livin' with
that Wasp girl too long.
I don't wanna tell you
things to worry you, man.
I brought you guys together, man.
Kid who tipped you, what was his name?
Frankie Wheels.
He's from the neighbourhood.
- Frankie is gonna know you did it too.
- Charlie, I wormed it out of him, man.
Bed Bug Eddie. Whoever hung that name
on him knew what he was talkin' about.
- He's got a thing about hackin' people up.
- What do you mean, hack up?
Look, we got one shot here.
We don't spend a nickel. Capeesh?
Well, we don't have to be crazy
about this either, you know?
- 100 bucks here for a couple of suits...
- We don't spend a nickel.
Not a fuckin' penny.
You understand me? Not a penny.
OK, not a penny. Shit. Just talkin' about
a couple of suits, you know?
Nickel-and-dime stuff, man.
- Nothing major.
- Hey, not a fuckin' penny.
You understand me?
We won't spend a penny.
- Not a fuckin' dime.
- Ain't he charming? The fucking idiot.
- You all right, honey?
- Everything's fine. Go back to bed.
I'll be there in a minute.
You woke her.
<i>(police sirens)</i>
Charlie, relax, man. God forbid, things
really go sour, I could reach out for us.
- To whom?
- Pete.
Uncle Pete would bail us out. He's
my goombah and I still call him Uncle.
- And he's on Eddie Grant's crew, man.
- You can't do shit, Paulie.
Aw, Charlie.
Charlie, I never knew nothin' about
no payoff to cops. I never knew nothin'.
But what I said would be there was there.
You'd have robbed that candy store, man.
Hey, there comes a time
you got to cowboy it, Charlucc'.
Yeah.
I got five grand for anyone who brings me
these thieves. I want it all over the street.
- Five?
- That's right.
- Where do we stand with the cops?
- Let them take care of themselves.
I want those guys.
They found him in an elevator shaft.
I got the call just as I was leavin'.
Jesus. That means the Internal Affairs
shoo-flies will be pokin' around.
Brace yourself for worse news, John.
Ritter was wired.
- Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
- They found the microphone.
I've worked 27 years putting together
something for myself and the family.
There's 27 years of hoardin' in there.
Stinkin' inflation eatin' it up
just as fast as I could fill it.
Ease up, John.
- I'm drinkin' what I always have.
- Three martinis in place of lunch.
Then chewin' up a whole
raw onion like it was an apple.
You look like a neon sign
for Gordon's gin.
<i>(door buzzer)</i>
Can I offer you a drink?
We're on duty.
Hey! Excuse me.
You on duty too?
Yeah.
Just a few questions, Mrs Ritter.
Did Bunky act peculiar
the last few months or so?
Different?
What has that got to do with some thief
pushing him down the elevator shaft?
He was wearing a tape recorder, Mrs
Ritter. Do you know anything about that?
How the hell would I know?
You're the policeman.
Did Bunky have a girlfriend?
Who were some of his friends?
No one.
He went to church a lot.
Sacred Heart.
Most of his free time he spent there.
He must have had some friends.
It's important that we locate
any tapes that Bunky may have had.
Yeah, I bet it's important.
I bet it's very important
to the two of yous.
The Internal Affairs people
were here hours ago.
Two college-educated little pricks.
Acted like they was
born and bred in Ohio.
I'm gonna tell you what I told them.
Walter neither drank nor gambled.
He disapproved of the lottery.
His spare time was spent makin'
novenas over at the Sacred Heart.
Did they dig around in his room?
- I wouldn't let 'em.
- Well, we're going to have to.
It's important.
Now, uh, which room is Bunky's?
You are not pokin' around
in Walter's room.
We're going through this place, madam.
You obstruct me and I'll see that
you never see a cent of his pension.
Aw, get out. Get outta here,
the two of yous.
After you're gone, I'm going to tear this
place upside down, like a cyclone hit it.
<i>I'm gonna call The Daily News</i>
to do a story on how the New York City
police treats the mother of a hero.
My brother's a priest.
He is an old-fashioned
parish priest with grey hair.
The two of us could do a scene on the six
o'clock news would have this city in tears.
My Walter was as tough as a bar of iron,
and he didn't get that from his father.
Now, you wanna fight, Officer?
Or do you get the hell out of my house?
Seven, eight, and one, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.
To the side, two, three, four.
Two, three, four. Shoulders.
One, two, three, four. Reverse.
- What are you doing here?
- I have to talk to you.
Three, four, keep goin'. Tina, can you
take over for me for a minute, please?
They're trying out for a commercial.
We got work to do.
Diane, I have to talk to you.
Come on, Diane.
<i>- (Tina) Five, six, seven, eight...
- What are you doing here, Paulie?</i>
- Thinkin' of joining?
- Maybe. Very possible. Looks nice.
Seven, eight, and smile.
Paulie, give me a break.
Four, five, six, seven, eight. And hold.
OK, gang, shake it out a bit,
and we'll start from the beginning.
How could you have
put me in this, Charlie? Huh?
- I'm not... You're not in this.
- A policeman died, Charlie.
Know what I'm saying? A man died.
Why don't you tell
the whole fuckin' world?
There's a way out of this.
There's 50 grand we got.
Yeah, back in the closet.
That could be our way out.
It could be our restaurant.
Are you crazy?
What do we do? Sit in our restaurant
waiting for the police to show up,
or for some psychotic criminal
to come and find you and chop you up?
- Oh, man.
- You listened to that fool, Charlie.
He's an idiot. He lives
in a fantasy, Charlie.
Look, Paulie has nothin' to do with this.
- Diane, I made my own decision.
- Paulie uses you, Charlie.
Don't you see what you get
for your loyalty to family? He uses you.
Why are you always one inch away
from becoming a good person, huh?
Maybe, I don't know...
maybe you're too soft.
I'm just too soft?
What are you? Some tough guy?
The men up in Maine make you
and Paulie look like spoilt little brats.
I was raised to believe that criminals,
criminals were too weak -
too weak to make it honestly.
Diane, maybe that shit works in Maine.
Here, on the streets, it don't work.
OK? It don't work.
Such a pathetic excuse, you know?
You just miss, you just miss by a...
Another fucking inch, and
you could really be someone special.
But you're all caught up in your tribal
loyalty. Your neighbourhood, Paulie...
Diane, maybe I don't
wanna change. All right?
Did you ever think of that?
Huh? If I don't wanna change,
what the fuck are you doin' with me?
What the fuck have you
been doin' with me all this time?
I always knew this would happen.
What the...?
Hit me again. See if I change.
Come on. Hit me again. Come on.
- Huh? Huh?
- Let go of me.
Charlie!
<i>(Eddie) Nicky Dum Dum found out
who robbed my money.</i>
Well, that's great.
How come it wasn't you that found out?
Hey! My guys been knocking their brains
out. So Nicky got there first. Good for him.
Maybe you got there first
and you forget to tell me.
- What the hell are you talkin' about?
- Somebody ratted.
It was that kid from Carmine Street.
Paulie somebody.
The kid you call your nephew.
Hey, Paulie don't rob safes.
He's a fuckin' waiter.
He's a scumbag, that's what he is.
Him and whoever was with him.
<i>(guard blows his whistle)</i>
Aw, another hard-on lookin' to shit on
anyone who ain't drivin' a Coupe de Ville.
- Guy's doin' his job.
- Yeah?
- What did you drag me up here for?
- Come on in.
What's up?
Paulie. They're gonna nail him, Charlie.
I can smell it. He left the file behind.
- So what?
- Fingerprints!
Fucking shit. Goddamn him.
And he's gonna feed them me.
- He won't give you up. There's blood.
- Blood. We're third cousins. He's...
With Italians that's like
twin brothers with the Irish.
And when he feeds me to them, they're
gonna press me to give them you, Charlie.
And they'll press me hard. And if I clam
up, you skate away, clean as a whistle.
Yeah? For what? How much?
Charlie, it's not what you think.
My end of this, I want it for my kid.
I leave that money with my wife,
they'll take it off her in 12 minutes.
I need somebody to see
she gets that money if I take a fall.
Whoa, Barney. Whoa.
There's got to be some other way.
No, no. I've been making lists up
in my head for hours. I got no one else.
- Why not split with the money now?
- I can't.
I can't leave those two until
I'm backed dead into a corner.
And I can't run with a 25-year-old needs
the side of his crib pulled up every night.
Barney, you can't lay this on me.
- Charlie, I'm makin' you a deal.
- Open the door.
- You got a sense of honour.
- Open the door.
- I can smell it in ya.
- Open the fucking door, Barney.
It's salt water. Briglia
wants to toughen up her legs.
He's from the south.
She looks like a fuckin' joke
rather than a racehorse.
Joke? I got five grand on this horse.
It better be no joke.
I know, I know. It's just that I never seen
a horse with its legs in no garbage can.
What do you know
about training a horse?
Waiting tables is what you know.
Making cheese is what I know.
- Let's stay with what we know here.
- You know about making cheese?
Not for nothin', but my mother sent me
over some mozzarella from your place.
It was no big bargain. Tough, and
it ain't the first time I noticed it, either.
- Your mozzarella is tough sometimes.
- Are you nuts?
We never sold a piece
of tough mozzarella in our life.
Tough like fuckin' shoe leather,
that mozzarella.
- Hey, Paulino.
- Hi, Uncle Pete. I was gonna call you.
Let's go talk private.
Where do you come off
to steal from Eddie Grant?
You ain't even a full-time thief.
You're a waiter, for Chrissake.
- Can you bail me out?
- I'm treadin' water myself.
Oh, man.
You pay attention,
cos your life depends on this.
If you won't say who was with ya, your
head gets hung on your mother's door.
- He wouldn't really do that, Pete.
- He'd sit down to a steak right after.
Come on.
- And what if I rat?
- He's still gonna do a number on ya.
Man.
He'd be makin' me a cripple.
He wants to crush me. And for what?
For what? I didn't rape his daughter.
I didn't spit in his fat face.
I took money from him.
I took fuckin' money.
It don't call for this, Pete.
<i>(sobs)</i>
I gotta take a leak.
Come on.
Oh, man.
Oh, man.
Hey.
What would you do,
you was in my shoes, Pete?
Me?
First espresso I carried to the bastard
would have a cupful of lye in it.
<i>What do I do? I can't put lye
in Eddie Grant's coffee.</i>
But I can't rat either. I ain't built that way.
Paulie, in my life,
I never told nobody to rat.
But it ain't the old days.
Wise guys rat people out now.
I can't, Pete.
What happens to anyone
what was with me?
- Who knows?
- Oh, man.
What about the money?
- What did you bag?
- 50 large. That's what my end came to.
Gimme... gimme 43 to bring Eddie.
Just say you blew the rest.
The maniac'll...
The maniac will hardly even count it.
What do they want?
This ain't no joke, Paulie.
I had a partner, Pete.
I was with another guy.
Some old Irish hard-on from
the Bronx. I don't owe him nothin'.
Barney. Fixes clocks. Castle Hill
and Westchester Avenue in the Bronx.
An old guy.
An old-time thief.
Oh, man.
Paulie, nothin' ever hurts
like you think it will.
You go numb. Then you wrap
your belt around your wrist
and you get yourself to
the nearest emergency room.
Oh, Uncle Pete.
Oh, Uncle Pete...
Oh, Uncle Pete. Uncle Pete.
Uncle Pete.
Uncle Pete!
Can you believe it? Bed Bug
had that kid's thumb taken off.
Jesus Christ.
He's like some Arab sheik
walkin' around with that crazy bulldog.
Yeah, but that's why Little Italy
got their own law and order.
Wanna know somethin'? It's
the only neighbourhood in the city
where little kids and old ladies
can still walk the streets at night.
Why the hell did Bed Bug
give us this one anyway?
It's a favour, I think.
"You can have the Irish", he told me.
"Keep it in the family."
Fuckin' humps. They're all alike.
They think they're real cute.
- There. It's over there.
- We got him here.
<i>(Diane) Charlie, this is not easy for me.</i>
<i>Our baby needs
a good start in life, Charlie.</i>
<i>So I don't feel guilty about taking
the shoebox full of money for the baby.</i>
<i>I've left you $5,000.</i>
<i>With $45,000 our baby
will have a good chance in life.</i>
<i>It should be a comfort you to know that.</i>
<i>I've been thinking about what
my life would be like, living with you.</i>
<i>The truth is, Charlie, I can't go through life
living with someone I could never trust.</i>
<i>(footsteps)</i>
<i>(knocking)</i>
- Paulie, what happened?
- Charlie, they took my thumb, man.
- Who did? Who did?
- It hurts so much.
- Paulie, what happened?
- The Bed Bug took my thumb, man.
Oh, no. No. Jesus Christ.
I'm gonna fuckin' kill him!
No, Charlucc'. That guy's a fuckin'
psycho, man. He'll chop you up.
Oh, man, it hurts so much.
Did they give you anything for this?
What did they give you?
They gave me...
They gave me this stuff.
They gave me this stuff at the hospital.
But I took all of it.
I've been taking it all day...
- You took all of this?
- It ain't done a fuckin' thing.
I took it all, man.
- Charlie, I didn't do nothin', man.
- What can I do for you?
It was my life, man.
I didn't wanna give the poor bastard up,
but it was my life, Charlie.
Barney ain't family.
I don't owe him that much.
You gave Barney up?
What about me, Paulie? I'm family.
Did they press you for me?
Yeah. Yeah, they... they pressed me.
They pressed me hard.
They took my thumb, Charlie!
Paulie.
What the hell happened here, man?
Look at that chair, man.
What the hell happened here?
She walked out. She took
the money and she left.
That twat robbed ya?
My God, what did you do, Charlie?
- I didn't do anything. I didn't hit her.
- You can't do that, man.
You don't abuse 'em once in a while,
they shit all over ya.
I don't mean you walk around morning
to night whackin' 'em upside the head,
but you gotta terrorise 'em once in a while
to keep 'em in line, you know?
I mean, like, you know, sometimes when
they embarrass ya in front of your friends,
you whack 'em with the backhand. Not
out in the room, like some fuckin' animal,
but nice, in the bedroom, you know.
Ba-boom. Ow!
What am I? Some kind of asshole?
Ba-boom. Another one. Oh.
Shit. What is this?
Some kinda fuckin' joke?
You get your coat on fast and
you don't say good night to nobody.
You understand me? Huh?
Huh?
That's to keep 'em humble. When you
don't let 'em say good night to nobody,
they walk out lookin' at the fuckin' floor.
Charlie!
They took my thumb!
Paulie. Paulie.
Bed Bug, I'm gonna
fuckin' kill you, goddamn it!
Paulie, Paulie, Paulie.
The motherfuckin'...
Paulie. Oh, Paulie.
I know... Paulie...
It's better if you don't know.
Here.
Here's $1,000. I'll send you
$200 every week.
Nora, don't fall apart on me now, huh?
- Huh?
- How did you let this happen to you?
Oh, how did I let my whole
life happen to me?
Why does it never work out right for us?
Why, Barney? Why does it
never work out right?
Nora, maybe I wasn't
the smartest kid on the block, huh?
I did the best I could, huh?
For the three of us.
Huh?
I gotta go.
<i>(snores)</i>
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Aw, Jesus Christ.
- All right. Here.
- I was havin' a bad dream.
How do you feel? Huh?
How's your hand?
I don't know yet.
You eat some of this. You'll feel better.
- Absolutely.
- OK?
Here you go.
Yuck.
- What's the matter?
- It's canned, man.
- It's good for you.
- Yeah.
White bread?
No wonder these Wasps
got no colour, huh, Charlie?
Hey, maybe she... she outgrew me,
you know? I mean...
- These Wasps, they outgrow people.
- Yeah, right.
Our mothers was right, Charluccio.
You really gotta stick with your own kind.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Charlie,
you know what really busts my balls?
I gotta go to work for that maniac.
I gotta be a goddamn
coffee boy in the club.
- How are you doin'?
- I'm good.
- All right?
- Absolutely.
Three sugars, Eddie?
Close the door.
Sit down.
No, sit over here.
Do you ever listen to tapes, Paulie?
Them tapes that everybody sees all over?
I've been thinkin' how you and that
Irishman did that piece of work up there.
It was you and him, no?
Barney. That's his name.
Barney.
This Irishman who you gave
two-thirds of the split to?
- Are you comfortable, Paulie?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm comfortable.
Tell me exactly how you handled it.
Who carried the stuff upstairs?
Who watched the window?
I wanna know each detail
of who did what.
Well, uh, me and the Irishman,
you know, the two of us, we had...
Two?
Not three?
Two.
Take it easy. Don't rush.
We're gonna go through
this a couple of times.
<i>(phone)</i>
Hello?
Hello?
Diane?
<i>Diane, is that you?</i>
<i>Luna, luna, luna, lu</i>
<i>I'll be waiting here for you</i>
<i>I live by moonlight</i>
<i>So give me moonlight</i>
<i>Who knows? I soon might</i>
<i>Give you my heart</i>
<i>Luna, luna, luna, lu...</i>
Hey, Paulie, buddy.
Hey, where are you goin'?
Take a hike, asshole.
You know, what was so important we
had to stop off at the apartment for that?
I got a phone call from Chicago,
from Barney. That was his end of it.
50 thousand? You just mailed
$50,000 to some Irish retard?
Hey, don't be so fuckin'
selfish, all right, Paulie?
I thought about this all week.
Had to do the right thing.
Charlie, some thief is gonna hand the kid
a rattle and he's gonna give him 50 large.
Shit. He sure as hell ain't gonna
go out and party with it, Charlie.
- You're a selfish fuck, you know that?
- "The right thing."
- That's for you. Grab a beer after work.
- Thank you.
- What did you do?
- What did I do? I tipped the guy.
- Big shot.
- Charlie, I only gave him a buck, man.
What's so terrible? The poor victim stands
in a closet breathing car fumes all day.
The job's a sentence. You gotta throw 'em
a beanie sometimes to make their day.
Charlie, we made his day.
His week.
Big fuckin' shot you are, Paulie.
Why the hell do you wanna go to the
grandstand? The clubhouse is nicer.
Hey, asshole, watch out, will ya?
The grandstand's where the regular guys
are. The clubhouse is full of phoneys.
- I though we was goin' to the grandstand.
- No, man.
The clubhouse is the only place
to really see a race from.
You stay in the grandstand and you're
with every garbage can walkin' the street.
You'll wind up with crabs
over there, you know?
Hey, Charlie. That's on me, man.
The midnight flight for Miami.
We're gonna make money here today,
then we're gonna party on the beach.
We're gonna live like a couple of sports
instead of busted suitcases.
Starry Hope. Ba-boom.
See "TR"? That means trainer.
- No kidding?
- Yeah.
See where it says "F"?
"F". That means filly.
They call girl horses fillies. And
if you see a "G", that means gelding.
That's when they whack
the horse's dick off. It's a memory.
- The balls, the balls.
- The balls. The dick, man.
No, they whack the balls. They whack the
balls off. They don't whack the dick off.
Yeah, OK.
Look at that pile
of garbage she's up against.
There'll be a flock of seagulls
following 'em around the track, man.
- What's goin' on with you today?
- What?
You're acting really, uh, nervous.
I'm excited, man. We're gonna win money
here today, Charlie. I feel it in my bones.
- How do you wanna bet her?
- What do you mean, man?
What do you want to do?
Go across the board?
Jesus Christ! Don't jinx her
with place and show bets.
For once in your life, don't hedge, OK?
You got a chance to win
here today, Charlie. Play to win.
Sometimes if you play safe, it don't hurt.
Charlie, think like a winner, OK?
That's what it takes to bounce back,
and I should know, no?
Johnny black, rocks, man.
What you havin', man?
- The usual.
- J&B over here.
Starry Hope. Post position four. That's OK.
Let's see. OK, look here.
They tell you the jockey's colours so
you can tell one horse from another.
OK, let's see. Orange, pink yuk...
- Pink what?
- Yuk.
- What the fuck is a yuk?
- Thing that goes around her neck.
Hey, stupid, that's a yoke.
- Yeah.
- A pink yoke.
Yeah. Pink blocks on sleeves,
orange cap with pink pompom and visser.
- Can you believe that get-up?
- What's a visser?
- A visser. In front of the cap.
- You always do this.
That's a visor. That's a yoke.
You say "visser" and "yuk".
You get everything fucked up.
You better bet on the right horse.
I'm worried about how
the jock's gonna look.
The Cheese Man has him lookin'
like some fag partyin' at Fire Island.
Forget the colours. Is this horse gonna
win? Are we gonna make some money?
Is she gonna win?
He asks me "Is she gonna win?"
You laughed when I told you about
the champion gene, but she got it, man.
- The champion gene?
- The groom who jerked her father off...
was not just winding his watch, OK?
<i>Salut', Charlucc'.</i>
- You're a very strange man, you know?
- You'll be kissin' me at the finish line.
<i>- You're a very strange man, Gibonni.
- Salut', Sambrini.</i>
Easy, baby.
In you go. In there. That's it.
Whoa. Attaboy.
<i>- Come on, already.
- (TV) They're all in line.</i>
They'll all in line.
<i>- Moving out to get the lead, Persian Rug.
- Come on, Starry Hope.</i>
<i>Starry Hope moves up on the inside.</i>
<i>There goes Starry Hope now
to get the lead.</i>
Starry Hope. Starry Hope.
All right! Go, Starry Hope!
Go, Starry Hope. Starry Hope.
Starry Hope. Starry Hope.
Watch, Paulie. Watch.
Come on, baby. Paulie, watch!
- Please.
- Starry Hope, Starry Hope...
<i>It's Starry Hope on the outside...</i>
Go, Starry. Starry Hope.
<i>- Tell me she won, Charlie.
- This result is not official.</i>
Tell me she won, Charlie. Tell me she
won, man. Tell me she won, Charlie.
It's a photo.
<i>(recites the Lord's Prayer rapidly)</i>
Starry fucking Hope. Please, God.
Please, please, please. Please, God.
What do you wanna do? You wanna
go somewhere? Go have a drink? Huh?
- I wanna go to Miami.
- You wanna go to Miami?
Yeah. It's warm there, Charlie.
- Sit down. I gotta take a leak.
- You gotta take a leak?
- Sit here.
- OK. Hurry.
- All right. Just stay there.
- OK, but hurry up.
Damn. Shit.
By a nose, man.
By a fucking nose.
Hey, you know, she ran her heart out
though, no? What are you gonna do?
Be nice to get a photo of that finish.
Blow it up, poster size.
Yeah. I don't need no pictures.
Hey, Paulie, money comes and it goes.
Things are gonna work out.
You just gotta take 'em how
they come, you know? You gotta be a...
good sport about it.
- Got a dollar?
- You need 50 cents.
Here.
Thank you.
You didn't tip him. Poor son of a bitch
stands in a booth all day long.
- Fuck him. What am I? Santa Claus?
- Fuck him? Let me tell you somethin'.
Don't worry about it. When you connect,
you're gonna connect to big bucks.
Me, I only connected
with a lousy 20 grand.
Charlie.
I knew you kept some of Barney's money.
I knew you weren't no dummy.
No, baby, I, uh, bet
Starry Hope across the board.
That's why she lost!
You jinxed her, Charlie!
You jinxed her, man.
Hey, Charlie, that's a hydrant.
We can't park here.
Hey, give me a break.
Want me to drive round the block?
- It's a $25 ticket, Charlie.
- Hey, Paulie, it's worth every cent.
Hey, man, this is crazy. We ought to be
on our way to Miami right this second.
- It's warm there, Charlie.
- Let's have one drink, huh?
- OK, one drink.
- Yeah.
- One.
- Yeah.
Absolutely.
I'll have a Rémy, soda back.
- I'll have the same, Tony.
- Things could be worse, huh?
Things could be worse. I mean,
uh, I got the restaurant, after all.
To the restaurant.
<i>- To the restaurant.
- Salut', Charlucc'.</i>
- OK, that's our one drink. Let's go.
- Whoa, Paulie, what is the hurry?
Can we stay here, have a drink
and relax a little bit? Huh? Huh?
Yeah.
By the way, I didn't ask. Uh...
- How's your pop doing?
- Oh, good. Good, yeah.
- Good? Oh, hey.
- He's doin' good.
- He'll be all right.
- There's somethin' I gotta tell you.
Uh...
Uh...
I'm really sorry about
this whole mess, you know?
Hey, Paulie. Hey.
Don't worry about it, all right?
OK? Things are gonna work out.
I mean, aside from Diane leavin' and...
you know, what happened
to your hand, it's gonna be all right.
<i>- Hey, ci andiamo, huh?
- For ever. Absolutely.</i>
OK, that's it, Charlie. Let's go, man.
Put your money away. I got it.
Anthony.
- Keep it.
- Can we please take a walk for a minute?
- What for?
- There's somethin' I gotta tell you, man.
So tell me here.
Barney.
Uh...
Somethin' funny must have gone down
up there in the Bronx, you know?
Those... those cops
who grabbed Barney, you know?
Uh, they must have
made a deal or somethin', Charlie.
Where you goin'? Where the fuck are
you goin'? What are you talking about?
The Bed Bug knows about you, Charlie.
What?
You fuckin' little... You fuckin' rat!
Charlie... Fuckin' Superman
would have broke, man.
Superman wouldn't have held out.
Charlie, I was just so fuckin' scared.
Fuckin' bum. You're
a fucking bum, Paulie.
Charlie, Charlie,
we won money today, man.
We can go to Miami. We can go
to Miami. Please, Charlie.
- You wanna know somethin'?
- We can go to Miami.
You wanna know somethin', you piece
of shit? Diane was right. You're no good.
You ain't no fucking good.
You screwed me, Paulie.
Charlie, we could go to Miami.
<i>(Eddie) Make your usual pick-up in your
usual place. That's all that counts, no?</i>
<i>(Bunky) That was Bed Bug Eddie Grant.</i>
<i>It's September 21 st.</i>
<i>11.25pm.</i>
<i>Heading for my monthly
pick-up on West Street.</i>
<i>From there, to Queens Village to deliver
the money to Inspector Ed Burns,</i>
<i>whose voice will be on this tape later on.</i>
<i>Hope to be erasing this
in Phoenix in about a year.</i>
- This is a private club, pal.
- Well, I'd like to see Eddie Grant.
He's in the back room.
You're Charlie Moran?
You're one of the scumbags
that robbed my money.
You were brought up around here, no?
Carmine Street.
Same thing. And you know you owe
the neighbourhood some respect.
People steal from Eddie Grant,
it makes for a total breakdown.
No one knows right or wrong.
Before you know it,
you got mulenyams movin' in.
- What the hell brings you in here?
- A tape I took off a dead cop,
that'll hang you by your balls.
You walked in here to threaten me?
You're fuckin' right
I walked in here to threaten you.
The last time somebody talked to me
close to that was from the Village too.
I parcel-posted the scumbag home.
He didn't have the tape
that could put you away for 20.
OK, let me give you some advice.
<i>You're behavin' like
a mammalucco. Capeesh?</i>
You walk in here. You don't show the club
no respect. You're actin' like a scumbag.
You're half Irish,
so I make considerations.
I give you this for the tape.
I promised myself I'd wipe
my ass with this hand.
And nobody, nobody but the Pope
could walk out of here with his hand.
<i>Mister, I am the Pope. This might
be your church, but right now,</i>
I'm the Pope of Greenwich Village,
because I got a tape. All right?
I like you. You have balls.
I don't get too mad at that.
Coffee, Eddie?
Three sugars, Eddie?
I already put your sugar in, Charlie.
Lye! I filled his fuckin' espresso with lye!
- You got one shot. Run!
- What did you do? I had him.
What do you mean, what did I do?
I went all the way for you. Come on.
OK, walk slow and be cool.
- Great.
- Charlie, we got a shot here.
We got tickets for Miami.
Charlie, things could be
a hell of a lot worse.
I mean, we got $20,000 in our pocket.
Things are lookin' up.
- You got a serious thinking disorder.
- What are you talkin' about?
- What am I...? Yeah, things are lookin' up.
- Absolutely.
I had him. I had him, Paulie.
Charlie, what I done back there,
I done 100 per cent for you, man.
- For me, right. You tell me about it.
- And another thing - you need me, man.
Without me along, you'd be
nickel-and-diming it in ten minutes, man.
I'm the one with the moves. Absolutely.
<i>The summer wind</i>
<i>Came blowin' in</i>
<i>From across the sea</i>
<i>It lingered there</i>
<i>To touch your hair</i>
<i>And walk with me</i>
<i>All summer long</i>
<i>We sang a song</i>
<i>And then we strolled that golden sand</i>
<i>Two sweethearts</i>
<i>And the summer wind</i>
<i>Like painted kites</i>
<i>Those days and nights</i>
<i>They went flyin' by</i>
<i>The world was new</i>
<i>Beneath a blue umbrella sky</i>
<i>Then softer than a piper man</i>
<i>One day it called to you</i>
<i>I lost you</i>
<i>I lost you to the summer wind</i>
<i>The autumn wind</i>
<i>And the winter winds</i>
<i>They have come and gone</i>
<i>And still the days</i>
<i>Those lonely days</i>
<i>They go on and on</i>
<i>And guess who sighs</i>
<i>His lullabies</i>
<i>Through nights that never end?</i>
<i>My fickle friend</i>
<i>The summer wind</i>
<i>The summer wind</i>
<i>Warm summer wind</i>
<i>Hm, the summer wind</i>
