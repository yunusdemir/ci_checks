<i>(man) I just jumped at
the opportunity to go,</i>
<i>without even thinking about it, really,</i>
<i>because it opened the way to an old
and very naive childhood fantasy of mine.</i>
<i>To go off into the wilderness</i>
<i>and test myself against
all the dangerous things lurking there.</i>
<i>And to find that basic animal I secretly
hoped was hidden somewhere in myself.</i>
<i>I imagined that at that point
I'd become a new man,</i>
<i>with a strength and courage
that I'd never known before.</i>
<i>As I traveled north,
it was on about the third day</i>
<i>that the reality of what I was about to try
to do began to seep into my bones</i>
<i>and gather in a knot
in the pit of my stomach.</i>
<i>Then I finally reached
the end of the line, Nootsack.</i>
<i>The sheer bulk of the supplies
the department sent along set me back,</i>
<i>as I had to get not only myself
but all this stuff</i>
<i>another 300 miles into the wilderness.</i>
So, you think north of here?
<i>The place is crawling with 'em,</i>
<i>But you wouldn't wanna go up there, son,</i>
<i>Got nothing to eat up there now,</i>
<i>There's nothing but ice
and snow and trees and,,,</i>
<i>You would be
the only fresh meat around there,</i>
<i>They'll come after you, son,</i>
<i>Just for the ugly fun of tearing you apart,</i>
<i>I'd heard some of the tales
about the Arctic,</i>
<i>The mad trappers, Diamond Tooth Gertie,
the ice-worm cocktail and all that,</i>
<i>so I was prepared
for things to be a little weird.</i>
<i>You found the bayonets,
I knew you would,</i>
<i>- Charlie,
- (# bassoon playing)</i>
<i>That's much better, much better, Francis,
Keep practicing,</i>
<i>The only plane in Nootsack
belonged to a part-time bush pilot,</i>
<i>gambler and real-estate tycoon
named Rosie Little.</i>
<i>While negotiating our deal, he introduced
me to this drink that he'd invented.</i>
<i>Known locally as Moose Juice,</i>
<i>it consisted of equal parts
Moose Brand beer and ethyl alcohol.</i>
<i>Before I knew it,
my old fear of flying evaporated,</i>
<i>and I spent all the money I had left
on 24 cases of beer.</i>
<i>T oo much weight, Tyler,</i>
Hang on!
<i>Whoa,,, Nelly!</i>
<i>Come on, Something else out of there now,
The big, heavy ones, Tyler,</i>
<i>I really had no way of knowing
exactly what of the department's gear</i>
<i>we donated to the people of Nootsack.</i>
<i>That big wooden box there,
Get rid of it, Go on, You don't need that,</i>
<i>But by our third attempt at takeoff,
it was a lot of what I might really need.</i>
<i>I tried not to think about it.
In fact, I tried not to think at all.</i>
<i>This one is it, I can feel it,</i>
<i>With my eyes still shut,
I realized that I was still alive.</i>
<i>But this was only the beginning.</i>
<i>It's funny how I keep thinking back
to that going-away party.</i>
<i>All the toasts by Dr Spivey
and Dr Showwalter,</i>
<i>and everybody singing
old Johnny Horton songs.</i>
<i>And the cake with all the coconut frosting,
with the plastic snowshoes on top.</i>
<i>But, then, why me?</i>
<i>Maybe this whole thing was a mistake.</i>
<i>Maybe my name just somehow
got onto the wrong page.</i>
<i>It might have been a typo, or maybe
somebody spilled a cup of coffee,</i>
<i>shuffled a couple of pages,
and there I was.</i>
<i>I can 't go on with this. This is suicide.</i>
<i>But I can 't turn around now.
I'd be a laughing stock.</i>
<i>Still, I wouldn 't last six hours down there,
let alone six months.</i>
<i>Uh ,,,</i>
<i>How do you,,,?</i>
<i>Don't worry about a thing,</i>
<i>I feel my way through these mountains
blindfolded all the time,</i>
<i>Tell me, Tyler,,,</i>
what's in the Valley of the Blackstone?
What is it? Manganese?
<i>Can't be oil,</i>
Is it gold?
<i>It's kind of hard to say,</i>
<i>You're a smart man, Tyler,
Keep your own counsel,</i>
We're all of us prospectors
up here, eh, Tyler?
Scratching for that one crack in the ground
<i>so we'll never have to scratch again,</i>
<i>I'll let you in on a little secret, Tyler,</i>
<i>The gold's not in the ground,</i>
<i>The gold's not anywhere up here,</i>
<i>The real gold is south of 60,</i>
<i>Sittin' in living rooms,
stuck facing the boob tube, bored to death,</i>
Bored to death, Tyler!
<i>(clunking)</i>
Ah.
<i>(engine splutters)</i>
<i>- (screeching)
- What was that?</i>
<i>(rapid bleeping)</i>
Oh, Lord!
Darn!
<i>- What's wrong?
- Take the stick,</i>
Arrrrgh!
What's wrong?
<i>Boredom, Tyler,</i>
<i>Boredom, that's what's wrong,</i>
And how do you beat boredom, Tyler?
Adventure.
Adventure, Tyler.
Where are you going? Rosie!
<i>Rosie, what are you doing?
I can't fly this thing, What do I do?</i>
<i>Catch the updraft there, Tyler, That's it,</i>
<i>Right in the middle, Good,</i>
<i>- Oh!
- Ah!</i>
Tyler, easy, easy, easy!
<i>- Back the other way! Turn it the other way!
- What?</i>
<i>Tyler, back, Tyler! Tyler!</i>
Easy! Tyler!
<i>The other way, That's it,</i>
<i>That's it, Good, Tyler,</i>
<i>That's it, You learn fast,</i>
<i>(engine starts)</i>
<i>(Rosie) Whoo!</i>
<i>Rosie, it's freezing,</i>
<i>Keep moving, Tyler, Gotta keep moving,</i>
<i>(smashing)</i>
<i>- You'll be fine,
- Gotta take it easy with some of this stuff,</i>
<i>Oh, uh,,,</i>
Mind your toes!
<i>Speed, Speed is of the essence, Tyler,</i>
<i>Especially when you don't know
how much fuel you got,</i>
<i>(smashing)</i>
<i>You got any last messages for the world,
Tyler, you better let me have 'em now,</i>
<i>That's sneaky, Tyler, Very sneaky,</i>
<i>Wait, Rosie! Rosie!</i>
<i>- Rosie,
- What?</i>
Hey?
Remember my position, will you?
<i>Sure, I'll stop by
for a drink sometime, huh?</i>
Rosie! Rosie!
What?
<i>- What is my position?
- It beats the hell out of me, Tyler,</i>
<i>I just hope I can find my way home,</i>
<i>Good luck, Tyler,</i>
<i>Yeah,</i>
<i>Well, interesting.</i>
<i>Now, what are the possibilities here?</i>
<i>The possibilities...</i>
<i>are many.</i>
<i>Gotta stay rational, be objective and. . .</i>
<i>plan out all the proper procedures
before doing anything else.</i>
<i>Make a list of priorities, remembering,
of course, to take into account variables,</i>
<i>and the fact that, inevitably,
some problems could arise that. . .</i>
<i>. . . inevitably, some problems could arise
that are completely unexpected.</i>
<i>Get a grip on yourself.</i>
<i>Section 3C of my instructions

<i>Ooh! Eeh!</i>
<i>(lively accordion music)</i>
Hey!
<i>March 23. 5am.</i>
<i>First report from Project Lupine.</i>
<i>Spent the night in a crate.</i>
<i>At daylight I'll try to get off the ice.</i>
<i>But I'd like to go on record as stating</i>
<i>that those who planned this expedition
made significant misc. . .</i>
<i>(howling)</i>
<i>. . . made significant miscalculations,</i>
<i>staggeringly incompetent. . .</i>
<i>(howling)</i>
<i>(howling continues)</i>
Oh!
<i>(panting)</i>
<i>(low growling)</i>
<i>(footsteps approaching)</i>
<i>(frenzy of howling and whining)</i>
<i>(howling stops)</i>
<i>(footsteps approaching)</i>
<i>(low grunt)</i>
<i>Hello,</i>
<i>Uh,,,</i>
<i>Excuse me, You sort of,,,</i>
Could you give me a hand
with some of this equipment, I wonder?
Ya!
<i>I have a lot of equipment here,
I really can't leave it, If you could,,,</i>
Hello?
<i>Ootek,</i>
Ootek?
Ootek?
<i>There are problems recording the events
of the past day or days.</i>
<i>The man has disappeared, although
his face remains vivid in my mind.</i>
<i>I've decided to stay here
until I get my bearings</i>
<i>and I've sorted out what constitutes reality.</i>
<i>(squealing)</i>
<i>April 1.</i>
<i>Temperatures soaring
to 4 1 degrees Fahrenheit.</i>
<i>For the first time in three days
I emerge from my sleeping bag</i>
<i>and begin trying to do my job.</i>
<i>So far I've collected
the following specimens:</i>
<i>five baby mice, one millipede</i>
<i>and something that looks
suspiciously like fleas.</i>
<i>My instructions are to track down
a specimen of Canis lupus,</i>
<i>dispatch it with a rifle
and examine the contents of its stomach.</i>
<i>(strange boom)</i>
<i>(strange boom)</i>
<i>(creaking)</i>
<i>(coughing and spluttering)</i>
<i>April 1 6.</i>
<i>Warm days bring
a kind of peace and stillness.</i>
<i>If there are any remaining fears,</i>
<i>they stem only from the recognition
of my own staggering insignificance.</i>
<i>(distant howling)</i>
<i>(howling continues)</i>
<i>May 3. In pursuit of phantoms.</i>
<i>I hear them every night, have seen
their tracks and collected their scat.</i>
<i>So they must be real.</i>
Agh!
<i>(rock falls)</i>
<i>Canis lupus arcticus.</i>
<i>The largest and rarest of the wolf species.</i>
<i>And its den.</i>
<i>The rules of the game are to choose
an observation post downwind,</i>
<i>out of the animal's field of vision,</i>
<i>gain your position and maintain it
without ever revealing your presence.</i>
<i>Outmaneuvered on all counts,
I opt to change the rules.</i>
<i>(pans clanking)</i>
<i>Reasoning that we're suspicious
of what we don't understand,</i>
<i>I decide to reveal
as much as possible about myself,</i>
<i>make a display.</i>
<i>(wolf grunts)</i>
<i>I haven't seen the wolf in two days.</i>
<i>I know I was violating the distance
principle, moving so far into his territory.</i>
<i>But since he hadn't seemed afraid of me,
I hoped that I could. . .</i>
<i>(snuffling)</i>
<i>(growling)</i>
<i>(panting)</i>
<i>(urinating)</i>
<i>I didn't take it personally.</i>
<i>This was a matter of principle,
a territorial dispute.</i>
<i>And he had fired the first shot.</i>
# What never?
No, never
# What never?
# Hardly ever
# Hardly ever, ever sick at sea
<i># So give five cheers and one cheer,,,</i>
Oh!
<i>(hums)</i>
# I am the very model
of a modern major general
# I've information vegetable,
animal, and mineral
# I know the kings of England
and I quote the fights historical
# From Marathon to Waterloo
in order categorical
# I'm very well acquainted too
with matters mathematical
# I understand equations
both the simple and quadratical
# About binomial theorem
I'm teeming with a lot of news
# With many cheerful facts
about the square of the hypotenuse
<i>(humming)</i>
<i>27 cups of tea later, I completed
a two-acre circle around my tent,</i>
<i>including a 100-yard section
of the wolf's path.</i>
<i>What had taken me six hours
and 27 cups of tea,</i>
<i>he accomplished in just a few minutes.</i>
<i>At each of the places that I'd marked,
he made his mark on the opposite side,</i>
<i>indicating that my boundary
was acceptable to him.</i>
<i>And thus he granted me the space
for Lupus Base One.</i>
<i>I'm supposed to watch his behavior,</i>
<i>but all he does is stay
in front of his den and watch mine.</i>
<i>I can't remember ever being the object
of so much constant attention.</i>
<i>I now arise at 1 0: 00 in the evening,</i>
<i>as everything becomes more active
during the long polar twilight.</i>
<i>In my notebook,
the wolf has become George.</i>
<i>The two are identical in color,</i>
<i>with the same contrasting
shoulder marking and long-legged gait.</i>
<i>But I've detected a difference,
and I've named her Angeline.</i>
<i>As George has become a family of five,</i>
<i>the reason for his long staring match
with me has lost its mystery.</i>
<i>It's well-known that wolves mate for life,
but knowing that has hardly prepared me</i>
<i>for their constant and varied
displays of affection.</i>
<i>Every evening George goes off
on his nightly rounds.</i>
<i>What he does on these excursions
remains a mystery to me.</i>
<i>Angeline always remains
behind with the cubs,</i>
<i>though I can see that she longs to follow.</i>
<i>(howls)</i>
<i>(distant howl)</i>
<i>- (howls)
- (distant howl)</i>
<i>(howling continues)</i>
<i>It's perplexing.</i>
<i>The overall reason behind the study
is that the government wants final proof</i>
<i>that wolves are responsible
for the disastrous decline in caribou.</i>
<i>So far I haven 't seen a single caribou,
or observed the wolves eating anything.</i>
<i>My own food supplies
are nearing exhaustion,</i>
<i>and the local environment
offers scant pickings.</i>
<i>Yet the wolves seem perfectly healthy.</i>
<i>I've done numerous scatological studies</i>
<i>and only turned up a smattering
of small mammal bones.</i>
<i>The whole question of sustenance
around Lupus Base One</i>
<i>has me completely mystified.</i>
<i>(scratching)</i>
<i>(squeals)</i>
<i>(squeaks)</i>
<i>(scuttling)</i>
<i>Angeline has given me the first clue.</i>
<i>In less than an hour
she's caught and consumed 23 mice.</i>
<i>My rough calculation:
one mouse every ten square feet.</i>
<i>Over 40,000 square feet in an acre.</i>
<i>That's 4,000 mice per acre.</i>
<i>The idea that a large animal
could live entirely on mice</i>
<i>will be greeted with skepticism,</i>
<i>unless I can perform an experiment.</i>
<i>(squealing)</i>
<i>(Tyler yells)</i>
<i>(Tyler continues to yell)</i>
<i>(yells)</i>
<i>(crunching)</i>
<i>(squeaks)</i>
<i>(chuckles)</i>
Arrr!
<i>(growls)</i>
<i>(squealing)</i>
<i>(snarling)</i>
<i>Five wolves appeared today.</i>
<i>I expected one of the pack battles
I'd read so much about.</i>
<i>It was Angie who was
right in the middle of things,</i>
<i>asserting her position
as the dominant female.</i>
<i>The challenges and assertions
were mostly symbolic.</i>
<i>There was no real fighting.</i>
<i>But Angeline got her point across.</i>
<i>George was never challenged.</i>
<i>He just stood there
with his air of masterful certainty,</i>
<i>the alpha wolf of the pack.</i>
<i>Usually, only the dominant pair
mate and have offspring,</i>
<i>going to seek their own privacy
for that purpose.</i>
<i>Apparently, the time had arrived
to rejoin the pack.</i>
<i>There's a young brown wolf who seems
to be a particular favorite of the cubs.</i>
<i>I've named him Uncle Albert.</i>
<i>Now Angeline is free again
to join George on his nightly rounds.</i>
<i>July 1 2.</i>
<i>I wonder why it was that long ago
I became a watcher of things.</i>
<i>Always watching others do and feel things
I wouldn't or couldn't do myself.</i>
<i>Always standing off at a distance,
isolated, detached.</i>
<i>I envy the wolves
for how they experience the world.</i>
<i>Always in such direct contact
with their environment,</i>
<i>traveling through their territories,</i>
<i>alert and attuned to all the signs
coming in through their senses,</i>
<i>telling them where a rabbit
recently passed or the sweet water lay,</i>
<i>revealing a whole universe to them
that we can never really know.</i>
<i>But I sit behind glass lenses,
filling up notebooks and triplicate forms,</i>
<i>trying to capture the wolves
within the pages of my journal.</i>
<i>And what'll be done with the study
when I'm finished?</i>
<i>Once these wolves
have been exposed to my world. . .</i>
<i>what will happen to them ?</i>
<i>There's a strange wolf
that I only see fleetingly.</i>
<i>He must be part of the pack,
but an outsider,</i>
<i>always following at a distance.</i>
<i>Perhaps another watcher.</i>
<i>(high-pitched bird call)</i>
Oh!
<i>Ootek thought you might need
some company,</i>
Ootek?
<i>Hello,</i>
<i>Really can't tell you how glad I am
to see the two of you,</i>
<i>It's been so long
since I heard another human voice,</i>
You have any ketchup here?
<i>No, I don't, I'm sorry,
I ran out a couple of weeks ago,</i>
<i>Here, have some fish,</i>
<i>Uh, no,</i>
<i>No, thanks, I don't eat fish,</i>
What do you eat?
<i>Actually,,,</i>
<i>I eat mice,</i>
<i>- You eat mice?
- Yeah,</i>
<i>(speaks native language)</i>
<i>It's an experiment, really,</i>
<i>You see, the wolves are supposed to eat
caribou, However, there are no caribou,</i>
<i>Basically, what the wolves
have been eating is mice,</i>
So I'm conducting an experiment
to see whether a carnivore, a big animal,
<i>can live on nothing but mice,</i>
<i>So I've been just eating mice,
and I'm doing fine,</i>
<i>(translates)</i>
<i>- What does he say?
- He says, "Good idea,"</i>
<i>(two men speak native language)</i>
<i>(Tyler) Syringe,</i>
<i>There,</i>
<i>- What's that?
- Clamp, This thing? Yeah,</i>
See the way this is set up here?
<i>This is so it grabs ahold, You got him,</i>
<i>(speaks native language)</i>
<i>It's a gripper,</i>
<i>(speaks native language)</i>
<i>I know what that is,
They had them at the mines,</i>
<i>Yeah, that's right, It's a gas mask,
except that I use it for wolf scats,</i>
<i>The wolf scat has little tiny animals,
little tiny parasites,</i>
And if you breathe these things in,
you breathe these little guys,
<i>they go up into your brain
and they eat it out,</i>
Scat? What is scat?
<i>Uh,,,</i>
<i>Wolf droppings,</i>
See, the idea behind this is
if you study what comes out of a wolf,
<i>you get a pretty good idea what went in,</i>
<i>Hmm,</i>
<i>I got a whole bag of them down there,
I got a whole sack,</i>
<i>(translates)</i>
<i>(speaks native language)</i>
What did he say?
<i>He says, "Good idea,"</i>
<i>(howling)</i>
<i>(howling continues)</i>
<i>(speak native language)</i>
<i>And so they settled in with me,
as if nothing could be more natural.</i>
<i>For my part,
I'm glad to have the company.</i>
<i>A seven,</i>
<i>Mike had gone to school in the south.</i>
<i>When his parents died,
Ootek adopted him.</i>
<i>Traditionally, they are no orphans
among the Inuit.</i>
<i>(plays stilted tune)</i>
I met a girl in a bar,
<i>and she wanted me to buy her drinks,
so I bought her some,</i>
<i>And then after a while,
she wanted to come home with me,</i>
<i>But I made a mistake,</i>
<i>I smiled at her,</i>
<i>That's what happens when a meat eater
becomes a sugar eater,</i>
<i>Ootek has taken
a particular interest in the study,</i>
<i>though I've learned there is little about
wolves that he doesn 't already know.</i>
<i>But I sense there is another side to Ootek,</i>
<i>some part of his nature
that he hasn 't shown.</i>
<i>I try not to annoy him
with too many questions,</i>
<i>but there are many things I'd like to know.</i>
<i>(speaks native language)</i>
<i>When he was young
he used to follow the wolves on their hunts,</i>
<i>(speaks native language)</i>
<i>The wolf is his helping spirit: amarok.</i>
<i>- Ama...
- Amarok.</i>
<i>- Ama...
- The wolf,</i>
<i>(speaks native language)</i>
<i>He went 30 days without food
and without protection from the cold,</i>
<i>Then he saw the wolf,</i>
<i>He felt the wolf bite into his heart,</i>
<i>When he woke up, he was all in one piece,</i>
<i>That's how the wolf
became his helping spirit,</i>
<i>(howling)</i>
<i>I wonder what makes them howl like that,</i>
<i>They howl when they're lonely,</i>
<i>Or to call their friends,</i>
<i>That way, the other,,,
the others will know where they are,</i>
<i>and then sooner or later
they're bound to meet up,</i>
<i>That's the way to catch wolves,
Go where they're howling,</i>
Hide behind a rock,
<i>and then howl like one of them,</i>
<i>And then,,, they will come to investigate,</i>
Yeah?
<i>When they get close enough,
you shoot 'em,</i>
<i>You shoot 'em,
Hopefully you hit 'em,</i>
<i>That's how you kill a wolf,</i>
<i>To me, wolves mean money,</i>
<i>It's a way of making a living,</i>
<i>One wolf pelt costs about $350,</i>
And I'vegottofeed myfamily.
<i>My children,</i>
Buy a snowmobile,
<i>food, rifle, bullets, whatever,</i>
<i>You wouldn't,,,</i>
I mean, you wouldn't kill these wolves?
<i>These ones? Oh,</i>
<i>No, I don't think so,</i>
<i>Besides, you would get mad
if I killed one of them,</i>
<i>And your gun is bigger than mine,</i>
<i>Yeah,</i>
<i>I'd like to, though,</i>
<i>Last week in August.</i>
<i>The Arctic summer has almost ended.</i>
<i>As the time grows short, I'm reluctant to
even sleep, for fear of missing something.</i>
<i>It's hard to imagine
that soon I'll have to leave.</i>
<i>But this place doesn 't belong to man.
It belongs to the wolves.</i>
<i>I can't really be sad, because it's here
that I've begun to feel wonder again,</i>
<i>like when I was a kid,
and this makes me deeply happy.</i>
<i>I wish I could say thank so,
just so, straight into the universe.</i>
<i>The rest of Ootek's family,
traveling through on their way north,</i>
<i>stopped by to spend the night.</i>
<i>(Ootek speaks native language)</i>
He wants me to tell you a story
of when there was nothing in the world
<i>except for a man and a woman,</i>
The woman came to a hole in the ice,
<i>and she reached in and felt something,
so she pulled it out,</i>
<i>And itwasatuktu,which isthecaribou.</i>
<i>And it was this animal that the lnuit
needed for their food and clothing,</i>
<i>For many years there were so many
caribou that the people called them lice,</i>
But soon all the hunting killed off
all the fat, healthy animals,
<i>and the only ones left over
were the weak, sick ones,</i>
Soon they began to breed and multiply,
<i>and the herd got weak,</i>
<i>Sick,</i>
<i>(speaks native language)</i>
<i>So the people came back to the woman
to ask her what to do,</i>
She went back to the hole in the ice,
because she needed a tool
to cut the sickness out of the herd,
<i>and the amarok was born,</i>
<i>Amarok.</i>
The wolves hunted the caribou
and they killed off all the weak, sick ones,
<i>and the people had
all the caribou that they needed,</i>
<i>(speak native language)</i>
<i>She says maybe you're like Ootek,</i>
<i>Maybe a long time ago
the wolf devoured you,</i>
<i>(distant howl)</i>
<i>(howling)</i>
<i>(howling continues)</i>
<i>(speaks native language)</i>
He knows, doesn't he?
<i>He knows what they're saying,</i>
The caribou are coming south
and the hunting will be good,
<i>and the amarok will be there,</i>
<i>We broke camp
and went in separate directions.</i>
<i>Mike went south, while Ootek
led me on a three-day trek,</i>
<i>down out of the high country
and on to the tundra.</i>
<i>There will be wolves there,
he said, as well as the ''tuktu'',</i>
<i>the great caribou herds
that once had sustained his people.</i>
<i>His endurance
is very much greater than mine,</i>
<i>but there are no expectations of me.</i>
<i>Not, I think, because I am the ''kabloona, ''
the white man,</i>
<i>but because he doesn 't recognize
such a thing as impatience.</i>
<i>(thunder)</i>
<i>(chanting)</i>
Whoo!
<i>(caribou grunting)</i>
<i>Deep in the bone,
the marrow reveals the disease.</i>
<i>And she had found the tool
to cut the sickness from the herd.</i>
<i>(chanting)</i>
<i>(distant gunshots)</i>
<i>Gunfire and the smell of gasoline.</i>
<i>(laughter)</i>
<i>(music on radio)</i>
Come on, right over here!
<i>Hello, Rosie,</i>
Is that you, Tyler?
<i>They called off the search,
They wrote you off,</i>
<i>I even said a few Hail Marys for you myself,</i>
<i>But I never believed in ghosts,
How are you?</i>
<i>- You all right? You got all your pieces?
- I'm all right, yeah,</i>
<i>- You've changed,
- I've changed?</i>
What the hell you been
doing out here, anyway?
<i>Tyler, you wouldn't believe what's
happened, It's fantastic, I hit the jackpot,</i>
<i>Two new planes, a new hotel,</i>
Have you seen an old lnuk?
Inuk? Eskimo? Drunk or sober?
<i>Quite sober,</i>
<i>Join the party,</i>
Altogether, 1400acres.
<i>Top of the mountain down to the lake,
including mineral rights,</i>
<i>But the real ace in the hole for us right now
is the hot spring right up there,</i>
<i>Amazing, lncredible, Steaming hot water
coming right out of the ground,</i>
When I say hot water,
what are you thinking?
Sitting in the bath tub?
<i>Japanese, A little bit of advertising,
plenty of raw fish,</i>
<i>Beautiful country all right,</i>
<i>Limitless possibilities,</i>
<i>Japanese, That's a great angle, Rosie,</i>
<i>Wait, You haven't heard the best part,
Listen to this,</i>
Once they've soaked their little buns
in our magic, medicinal hot spring,
<i>you bottle it up, stick a fancy label on it,
they take it home with them,</i>
<i>Before you know it, we'll be
shipping it outta here by the truckload,</i>
<i>And what does it cost us? Nothing,
Just bubbles right out of the ground,</i>
<i>I bet you we could figure out a way
to bottle the air up here, too,</i>
<i>Fantastic,</i>
<i>Gentlemen, here's to the future,</i>
<i>Watch the horns,</i>
<i>Come on, Tyler, Climb in,</i>
<i>I'm taking you out,</i>
<i>Look, Tyler, maybe you can't see it,
but you've gone round the bend a little,</i>
<i>I know, I've seen it before,</i>
<i>Come on, Get in the,,,</i>
<i>(chuckles)</i>
<i>I know where your camp is, Tyler,</i>
<i>I'll meet you there in a couple of days,
We'll talk it over,</i>
<i>How could he have known about
Lupus Base unless he'd been there?</i>
<i>To get back would be
a three-day hike for me,</i>
<i>but for him, it's only minutes away.</i>
<i>(whining)</i>
<i>(whining)</i>
Pups, where's your folks?
<i>It's pretty lonely around here,</i>
<i>Don't you worry about anything,
Everything's gonna be just fine,</i>
<i>(plane overhead)</i>
Get outta there!
Get out of here, Rosie!
I don't want you here! Get out of here!
Get away!
<i>(gunshot)</i>
<i>(music on radio)</i>
<i>Mike,</i>
What are you doing here?
<i>I'm on my way north,
The snow is coming,</i>
Have you seen Ootek?
<i>No,</i>
<i>He just disappeared,
We were out there and he,,,</i>
<i>Yeah, I know, The old ones seem to have
a way of doing that, just disappearing,</i>
<i>Which is what I'm about to do,</i>
Have you seen the wolves?
Have you seen George and Angie?
<i>No, they must have gone north,</i>
<i>No, No, the puppies are still here, They
wouldn't go off and leave the puppies,</i>
<i>Stop worrying about the pups
and start worrying about yourself,</i>
<i>This thing that's happening
is too big for you,</i>
<i>It's a question of how you survive it,</i>
<i>Survival,,,</i>
<i>of the fittest,</i>

<i>In the end, there were no simple answers.</i>
<i>No heroes, no villains.</i>
<i>Only silence.</i>
<i>But it began the moment
that I first saw the wolf.</i>
<i>By the act of watching them,
with the eyes of a man,</i>
<i>I had pointed the way
for those who followed.</i>
<i>(howling)</i>
<i>The pack returned for the cubs, as
there are no orphans among the wolves.</i>
<i>And eventually the losses of that autumn
became a distant memory.</i>
<i>I believe the wolves went off to a wild
and distant place somewhere,</i>
<i>although I don 't really know,</i>
<i>because I turned away
and didn 't watch them go.</i>
