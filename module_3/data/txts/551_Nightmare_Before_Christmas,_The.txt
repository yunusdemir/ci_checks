'Twas a long time ago,
longer now than it seems...
in a place that perhaps
you've seen in your dreams.
For the story that you
are about to be told...
took place
in the holiday worlds of old.
Now, you've probably wondered
where holidays come from.
If you haven't,
I'd say it's time you begun!
<i>Boys and girls
of every age</i>
<i>Wouldn't you like to see
something strange</i>
<i>Come with us
and you will see</i>
<i>This our town
of Halloween</i>

<i>Fingers like snakes
and spiders in my hair</i>
<i>This is Halloween
This is Halloween</i>
<i>Halloween, Halloween
Halloween, Halloween</i>
<i>In this town we call home</i>
<i>Everyone hail

<i>In this town
Don't we love it now</i>
<i>Everybody's waiting

<i>'Round that corner, man
Hiding in the trash can</i>

<i>- This is Halloween - Red
and black - And slimy green</i>
<i>- Aren't you scared
- Well, that's just fine</i>
<i>Say it once, say it twice
Take a chance and roll the dice</i>
<i>Ride with the moon
in the dead of night</i>
<i>Everybody scream
Everybody scream</i>
<i>In our town of Halloween</i>
<i>I am the clown
with a tear-away face</i>
<i>Here in a flash
and gone without a trace</i>
<i>I am the who

<i>I am the wind blowing
through your hair</i>
<i>I am the shadow
on the moon at night</i>
<i>Filling your dreams

<i>Tender lumplings everywhere</i>
<i>Life's no fun

to the pumpkin song</i>
<i>- La, la, la, la, la, la
- Halloween, Halloween</i>
<i>La, la, la, la, la, la
Whee</i>
- It's over!
- We did it!
- Wasn't it terrifying?
- What a night!
Great Halloween, everybody.
I believe it was our most horrible yet.
Thank you, everyone.
No! Thanks to you, Jack.
Without your
brilliant leadership...
- Not at all, Mayor.
- You're such a scream, Jack.
- You're a witch's fondest dream.
- You made walls fall, Jack.
Walls fall? You made
the very mountains crack, Jack.
- The deadly nightshade you slipped me wore off, Sally.
- Let go!
- You're not ready for so much excitement.
- Yes, I am!
- You're coming with me!
- No, I'm not!
Come back here, you foolish...
Oh! Oh! Oh-oh-oh.
Ooh, Jack, you made
wounds ooze and flesh crawl.
Thank you. Thank you!
Thank you very much!
<i>Hold it. We haven't given out
the prizes yet.</i>
Our first award
goes to the vampires...
for most blood drained
in a single evening.
<i>Our second and
honorable mention...</i>
<i>goes to the fabulous
Dark Lagoon leeches.</i>
Nice work, Bone Daddy.
Yeah, I guess so.
Just like last year...
and the year before that,
and the year before that.
<i>There are few who deny
at what I do I am the best</i>
<i>For my talents
are renowned far and wide</i>
<i>When it comes to surprises
in the moonlit night</i>
<i>I excel without ever even trying</i>
<i>With the slightest little effort</i>
<i>Of my ghost-like charms</i>
<i>I have seen grown men
give out a shriek</i>
<i>With a wave of my hand
and a well-placed moan</i>
<i>I have swept the very bravest
off their feet</i>
<i>Yet year after year</i>
<i>It's the same routine</i>
<i>And I grow so weary
of the sound of screams</i>
<i>And I, Jack
the Pumpkin King</i>
<i>Have grown so tired
of the same old thing</i>
<i>Oh, somewhere deep</i>
<i>Inside of these bones</i>
<i>An emptiness</i>
<i>Began to grow</i>
<i>There's something out there</i>
<i>Far from my home</i>
<i>A longing that</i>
<i>I've never known</i>
<i>I'm the master of fright</i>
<i>And a demon of light</i>
<i>And I'll scare you
right out of your pants</i>
<i>To a guy in Kentucky
I'm Mr. Unlucky</i>
<i>And I'm known throughout
England and France</i>
<i>And since I am dead
I can take off my head</i>
<i>To recite Shakespearean quotations</i>
<i>No animal nor man
can scream like I can</i>
<i>With the fury
of my recitations</i>
<i>But who here</i>
<i>Would ever understand</i>
<i>That the Pumpkin King
with the skeleton grin</i>
<i>Would tire of his crown
If they only understood</i>
<i>He'd give it all up</i>
<i>If he only could</i>
<i>Oh, there's an empty</i>
<i>Place in my bones</i>
<i>That calls out for</i>
<i>Something unknown</i>
<i>The fame and praise</i>
<i>Come year after year</i>
<i>Does nothing for</i>
<i>These empty tears</i>
Jack.
I know how you feel.
Sally!
You've come back.
- I had to.
- For this!
- Yes.
- Shall we, then?
That's twice this month you've slipped
deadly nightshade into my tea and run off.
- Three times.
- You're mine, you know!
I made you with my own hands.
You can make other creations.
I'm restless. I can't help it.
It's a phase, my dear. It'll pass.
We need to be patient, that's all.
But I don't want to be patient.
No, Zero, not now.
I'm not in the mood.
All right.
Here you go, boy.
Mornin', gents!
Jack, you home?
Jack, I've got the plans
for next Halloween.
I need to go over them with you
so we can get started.
Jack, please! I'm only
an elected official here.
I can't make decisions by myself.
Jack, answer me!
- Huh?
- He's not home.
- Where is he?
- He hasn't been home all night.
Where are we?
It's someplace new!
What is this?
Whoa-oa-oa!
Whoa!
<i>What's this, what's this
There's color everywhere</i>
<i>What's this
There's white things in the air</i>
<i>What's this, I can't believe my eyes
I must be dreaming</i>
<i>Wake up, Jack, this isn't fair
What's this</i>
<i>What's this, what's this
There's something very wrong</i>
<i>What's this, there's people
singing songs, what's this</i>
<i>The streets are lined with little
creatures laughing Everybody seems so happy</i>
<i>Have I possibly gone daffy
What is this</i>
<i>What's this</i>
<i>There's children throwing snowballs
instead of throwing heads</i>
<i>They're busy building toys
and absolutely no one's dead</i>
<i>There's frost in every window
Oh, I can't believe my eyes</i>
<i>And in my bones
I feel the warmth</i>
<i>That's coming from inside</i>
<i>Oh, look, what's this
They're hanging mistletoe</i>
<i>They kiss, why that looks
so unique, inspired</i>
<i>They're gathering around
to hear a story</i>
<i>Roasting chestnuts on a fire
What's this</i>
<i>What's this in here
They've got a little tree, how queer</i>
<i>And who would ever think
And why</i>
<i>They're covering it
with tiny little things</i>
<i>They've got electric lights on strings
and there's a smile on everyone</i>
<i>So now correct me if I'm wrong
This looks like fun, this looks like fun</i>
<i>Oh, could it be I got my wish
What's this</i>
<i>Oh my, what now
The children are asleep</i>
<i>But look
There's nothing underneath</i>
<i>No ghouls, no witches here to scream
and scare them or ensnare them</i>
<i>Only little cozy things
secure inside their dreamland</i>
<i>What's this</i>
<i>The monsters are all missing
and the nightmares can't be found</i>
<i>And in their place there seems
to be good feeling all around</i>
<i>Instead of screams, I swear
I can hear music in the air</i>
<i>The smell of cakes and pies
are absolutely everywhere</i>
<i>The sights, the sounds
they're everywhere and all around</i>
<i>I've never felt so good before</i>
<i>This empty place inside of me is
filling up I simply cannot get enough</i>
<i>I want it, oh, I want it
Oh, I want it for my own</i>
<i>I've got to know, I've got to know
what is this place that I have found</i>
<i>What is this</i>
Christmas Town?
Hmm.
Ho-ho-ho-ho!
Hmm.
- This has never happened before.
- It's suspicious.
- It's peculiar.
- It's scary.
Stand aside. Coming through.
We've got to find Jack!
There's only 35 days left
till next Halloween!
Three sixty-four!
Is there anywhere
we've forgotten to check?
I looked in every mausoleum.
We opened the sarcophagi!
I tromped through
the pumpkin patch.
I peeked behind
the cyclops' eye.
I did! But he wasn't there.
It's time to sound the alarms!
Frog's breath
will overpower any odor.
Bitter!
Worm's wart. But where,
where is that worm's wart?
Sally? Is that soup ready yet?
Ah. Coming!
Lunch!
Ah, what's that?
Worm's wart! Mmm!
And frog's breath?
Wh-What's wrong? I-I thought
you liked frog's breath.
Nothing's more suspicious
than frog's breath.
Until you taste it,
I won't swallow a spoonful.
I'm not hungry. Oops.
You want me to starve...
an old man like me,
who hardly has strength as it is.
Me, to whom you owe
your very life.
Oh, don't be silly.
Mmm! See? Scrumptious!
Did anyone think
to dredge the lake?
Oh, this morning.
- Hear that? -
Ah, what? - Shh.
Zero!
- Jack's back!
- Jack's back! Jack's back!
- Where have you been?
- Call a town meeting and I'll tell everyone all about it.
- When?
- Immediately!
Town meeting! Town meeting!
Town meeting tonight!
Town meeting!
Town meeting tonight!
Listen, everyone!
I want to tell you
about Christmas Town.
<i>There were objects so peculiar
they were not to be believed</i>
<i>All around things
to tantalize my brain</i>
<i>It's a world unlike anything
I've ever seen</i>
<i>And as hard as I tried
I can't seem to describe</i>
<i>Like a most improbable dream</i>
<i>But you must believe
when I tell you this</i>
<i>It's as real as my skull
and it does exist</i>
Here, let me show you.
Ooh!
<i>This is a thing
called a present</i>
<i>The whole thing
starts with a box</i>
<i>- A box - Is it steel
- Are there locks</i>
<i>- Is it filled with a pox
- A pox, how delightful, a pox</i>
If you please.
<i>Just a box with
bright colored paper</i>
<i>And the whole thing's
topped with a bow</i>
<i>- A bow - But why - How ugly
- What's in it, what's in it</i>
<i>That's the point of the thing
Not to know</i>
<i>- It's a bat - Will it bend
- It's a rat - Will it break</i>
<i>Perhaps it's the head
that I found in the lake</i>
<i>Listen now
You don't understand</i>
<i>That's not the point
of Christmasland</i>
<i>Now pay attention
We pick up an oversized sock</i>
<i>And hang it like this
on the wall</i>
<i>Oh, yes, does it still
have a foot</i>
<i>- Let me see, let me look
- Is it rotted and covered with gook</i>
Um, let me explain.
<i>There's no foot inside
but there's candy</i>
<i>- Or sometimes it's filled with small toys
- Small toys</i>
<i>- Do they bite - Do they
snap - Or explode in the sack</i>
<i>Well, perhaps they just spring
out and scare girls and boys</i>
<i>What a splendid idea
This Christmas sounds fun</i>
<i>I fully endorse it
Let's try it at once</i>
<i>Everyone, please
Now not so fast</i>
<i>There's something here
that you don't quite grasp</i>
I don't know.
Do you get it?
Well, I may as well
give them what they want.
<i>And the best I must confess
I have saved for the last</i>
<i>For the ruler
of this Christmasland</i>
<i>Is a fearsome king
with a deep, mighty voice</i>
<i>Least, that's what
I've come to understand</i>
<i>And I've also heard it told
That he's something to behold</i>
<i>Like a lobster huge and red</i>
<i>When he sets out to slay
with his rain gear on</i>
<i>Can'ting bulging sacks
with his big great arms</i>
<i>That is so I've heard it said</i>
<i>And on a dark cold night
under full moonlight</i>
<i>He flies into a fog
like a vulture in the sky</i>
<i>And they call him</i>
<i>Sandy Claws</i>
<i>Well, at least they're excited</i>
<i>But they don't understand</i>
<i>That special kind of feeling
in Christmasland</i>
Oh, well.
Hmm.
Hmm.
There's got to be a logical way
to explain this Christmas thing.
You've poisoned me for the
last time, you wretched girl.
Oh, my head!
The door is open!
- Hello!
- Jack Skellington!
- Up here, my boy.
- Doctor, I need to borrow some equipment.
Is that so? Whatever for?
I'm conducting a series
of experiments.
How perfectly marvelous!
- Curiosity killed the cat, you know.
- I know.
Come on into the lab
and we'll get you all fixed up.
Hmm. Experiments?
Zero, I'm home!
Interesting reaction!
But what does it mean?
You can come out now
if you promise to behave.
Sally?
Oh, gone again!
Hmm.
Oh!
<i>Something's up with Jack
Something's up with Jack</i>
<i>Don't know if we're ever
going to get him back</i>
<i>He's all alone up there
locked away inside</i>
<i>- Never says a word
- Hope he hasn't died</i>
<i>Something's up with Jack
Something's up with Jack</i>
<i>Christmastime
is buzzing in my skull</i>
<i>Will it let me be
I cannot tell</i>
<i>There's so many things
I cannot grasp</i>
<i>When I think I've got it
and then at last</i>
<i>Through my bony fingers
it does slip</i>
<i>Like a snowflake
in a fiery grip</i>
<i>Something here I'm not quite getting
Though I try I keep forgetting</i>
<i>Like a memory
long since past</i>
<i>Here in an instant
Gone in a flash</i>
<i>What does it mean
What does it mean</i>
<i>In these little bric-a-brac
A secret's waiting to be cracked</i>
<i>These dolls and toys confuse me so
Confound it all, I love it though</i>
<i>Simple objects, nothing more
But something's hidden through a door</i>
<i>Though I do not have the key
Something's here I cannot see</i>
<i>What does it mean
What does it mean</i>
<i>What does it mean</i>
Hmm. Hmm.
<i>I've read these Christmas books
so many times</i>
<i>I know the stories
and I know the rhymes</i>
<i>I know the Christmas carols
all by heart</i>
<i>My skull's so full
it's tearing me apart</i>
<i>As often as I've read them
Something's wrong</i>
<i>It's so hard to put
my bony finger on</i>
<i>Or perhaps it's really not as deep
as I've been led to think</i>
<i>Am I trying much too hard</i>
<i>Of course
I've been too close to see</i>
<i>The answer's right in front of me
Right in front of me</i>
<i>It's simple really, very clear
Like music drifting in the air</i>
<i>Invisible but everywhere</i>
<i>Just because I cannot see it
Doesn't mean I can't believe it</i>
<i>You know I think this Christmas thing
is not as tricky as it seems</i>
<i>And why should they have all the fun
It should belong to anyone</i>
<i>Not anyone in fact, but me
Why I can make a Christmas tree</i>
<i>And there's no reason I can find
I couldn't handle Christmastime</i>
<i>I bet I could improve it too
And that's exactly what I'll do</i>
Eureka!
This year,
Christmas will be ours!
Patience, everyone. Jack has
a special job for each of you.
Dr. Beetlestein.
Your Christmas assignment
is ready.
Dr. Beetlestein,
to the front of the line.
What kind of noise is that
for a baby to make?
- Perhaps it can be improved?
- No problem!
I knew it!
Doctor, thank you for coming.
We need some of these.
Hmm.
Their construction should be
exceedingly simple, I think.
How horrible
our Christmas will be.
No! How jolly!
Oh. How jolly
our Christmas will be.
- What are you doing here?
- Jack sent for us.
- Specifically.
- By name.
- Lock. -
Shock. - Barrel.
Jack, Jack,
it's Boogie's boys.
Ah, Halloween's finest
trick-or-treaters.
The job I have for you
is top secret.
It requires craft,
cunning, mischief.
And we thought
you didn't like us, Jack.
Absolutely no one
is to know about it. Not a soul!
Now.
Tree.
Christmas Town.
Ow! Hmm.
And one more thing.
Leave that no-account
Oogie Boogie out of this!
Whatever you say, Jack.
- Of course, Jack.
- Wouldn't dream of it, Jack.
<i>Kidnap Mr. Sandy Claws</i>
<i>- I wanna do it - Let's draw straws
- Jack said we should work together</i>
<i>- Three of a kind - Birds of
a feather - Now and forever</i>
<i>La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la</i>
<i>Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Lock him up real tight</i>
<i>Throw away the key
and then turn off all the lights</i>
<i>First we're going to set some bait
inside a nasty trap and wait</i>
<i>When he comes a-sniffing
We will snap the trap and close the gate</i>
<i>Wait, I've got a better plan
to catch this big red lobster man</i>
<i>Let's pop him in a boiling pot
And when he's done we'll butter him up</i>
<i>Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Throw him in a box</i>
<i>Bury him for 90 years
Then see if he talks</i>
<i>And Mr. Oogie Boogie man</i>
<i>Can take the whole thing
over then</i>
<i>He'll be so pleased I do declare</i>
<i>That he will cook him rare
Whee</i>
<i>I say that we take a cannon
Aim it at his door and then</i>
<i>Knock three times and when he answers
Sandy Claws will be no more</i>
<i>You're so stupid Think now if
we blow him up to smithereens</i>
<i>We may lose some pieces and then
Jack will beat us black and green</i>
<i>Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Tie him in a bag</i>
<i>Throw him in the ocean
Then see if he is sad</i>
<i>Because Mr. Oogie Boogie
is the meanest guy around</i>
<i>- If I were on his boogie list
- I'd get out of town</i>
<i>He'll be so pleased
by our success</i>
<i>That he'll reward us too
I'll bet</i>
<i>Perhaps he'll make
his special brew</i>
<i>Of snake and spider stew</i>
<i>We're his little henchmen
and we take ourjob with pride</i>
<i>We do our best to please him
and stay on his good side</i>
<i>- I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb
- I'm not the dumb one</i>
<i>- You're no fun -
Shut up - Make me</i>
<i>I've got something, listen now
This one is real good you'll see</i>
<i>We'll send a present to his door
Upon there'll be a note to read</i>
<i>Now in the box we'll wait
and hide until his curiosity</i>
<i>Entices him to look inside and then
we'll have him one, two, three</i>
<i>Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Beat him with a stick</i>
<i>Lock him up for 90 years
See what makes him tick</i>
<i>Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Chop him into bits</i>
<i>Mr. Oogie Boogie
is sure to get his kicks</i>
<i>Kidnap the Sandy Claws
See what we will see</i>
<i>Lock him in a cage
and then throw away the key</i>
Sandy Claws, huh?
It goes something like this.
How about it?
Think you can manage?
A- one, and a-two,
and a-three, and a...
- Next!
- Fantastic!
Now, why don't you all practice on that,
and we'll be in great shape.
Sally, I need your help
more than anyone's.
You certainly do, Jack.
I had the most terrible vision.
- That's splendid!
- No! It was about your Christmas.
- There was smoke and fire.
- That's not my Christmas.
My Christmas is filled
with laughter and joy.
And this: My Sandy Claws outfit.
I want you to make it.
Jack, please listen to me.
It's going to be a disaster.
How could it be?
Just follow the pattern.
This part's red.
The trim is white.
- It's a mistake, Jack.
- Now, don't be modest.
Who else is clever enough
to make my Sandy Claws outfit?
- Next!
- I have...
- Oh.
- Every confidence in you.
But it seems wrong to me.
Very wrong.
This device
is called a nutcracker.
Jack! Jack! We caught 'im!
We got 'im!
Perfect! Open it up. Quickly!
That's not Sandy Claws!
- It isn't?
- Who is it?
- Bunny!
- Eek! Ooh.
Not Sandy Claws! Take him back!
- We followed your instructions.
- We went through the door.
Which door?
There's more than one.
Sandy Claws is behind the door
shaped like this.
I told you!
- You knock it off!
- Get... Ow! Ow!
I'm very sorry
for the inconvenience, sir.
Take him home first!
And apologize again.
Be careful with Sandy Claws
when you fetch him.
- Treat him nicely.
- Got it.
We'll get it right next time.
You will be a decided improvement...
over that treacherous Sally.
Master. The plans.
Excellent, Igor.
- What?
- What's goin' on?

Kathleen, Bobby, Susie.
Yes, Susie's been nice.
Nice, nice, naughty,
nice, nice, nice...
There are hardly
any naughty children this year.
Now, who could that be?
- Trick or treat!
- Huh?
Ya!
You don't look like yourself,
Jack, not at all.
Isn't that wonderful?
It couldn't be more wonderful!
But you're the Pumpkin King!
Not anymore.
And I feel so much better now!
Jack, I know you think
something's missing, but...
- Ow!
- Sorry.
You're right.
Something is missing, but what?
I've got the beard, the coat,
the boots, the belt...
- Jack, Jack, this time we bagged him.
- This time we really did!
- He sure is big, Jack!
- And heavy!
Let me out!
Sandy Claws in person!
What a pleasure to meet you!
Wh... Why, you have hands!
- You don't have claws at all!
- Wha...
Where am I?
Surprised, aren't you?
I knew you would be.
You don't need to have another
worry about Christmas this year.
- Wha... Well, wha... Wha...
- Consider this a vacation, Sandy, a reward.
- It's your turn to take it easy.
- B-But there must be some mistake!
See that he's comfortable.
Just a second, fellas. Of course!
- That's what I'm missing!
- B-B-but...
- Thanks.
- Y-You just can't...
Hold on.
Where are we going now?
Ho, ho, ho! No.
- This is worse than I thought.
- Ho, ho, ho. - Much worse.
- Ho, ho, ho!
- I know.
Me, on vacation?
On Christmas Eve?
- Where are we taking him?
- Where?
To Oogie Boogie, of course.
There isn't anywhere in the whole world
more comfortable than that.
- And Jack said to make him comfortable, didn't he?
- Yes, he did.
Haven't you heard of peace on earth
and goodwill toward men?
No!
Ah! This'll stop Jack.
What a joy to think of all
we'll have in common.
We'll have conversations
won'th having!
Don't do this!
Naughty children
never get any presents!
- I think he might be too big!
- Ooh!
No, he's not.
If he can go down a chimney...
he can fit down here.
Well, well, well!
What have we here?
Sandy Claws, huh?
Oooh, I'm really scared!
So you're the one
everybody's talkin' about.
<i>You'rejokin'
You'rejokin'</i>
<i>I can't believe my eyes</i>
<i>You'rejokin'me, you gotta be
This can't be the right guy</i>
<i>He's ancient, he's ugly
I don't know which is worse</i>
<i>I might just split a seam now
if I don't die laughin' first</i>
<i>Mr. Oogie Boogie says
there's trouble close at hand</i>
<i>You better pay attention now
'cause I'm the boogie man</i>
<i>And if you aren't shakin'

<i>Release me now or you must face
the dire consequences</i>
<i>The children are expecting me
So please, come to your senses</i>
<i>Ah, you'rejokin'
You'rejokin'</i>
<i>I can't believe my ears</i>
<i>Would someone shut this fella up
I'm drownin' in my tears</i>
<i>It's funny
I'm laughin'</i>
<i>You really are too much</i>
<i>And now with your permission
I'm going to do my stuff</i>
- What are you going to do?
- I'm gonna do the best I can.
<i>Whoa</i>
<i>The sound of rolling dice to me
is music in the air</i>
<i>'Cause I'm a gamblin' boogie man
although I don't play fair</i>
<i>It's much more fun
I must confess with lives on the line</i>
<i>Not mine, of course
But yours, old boy</i>
<i>Now that'd bejust fine</i>
<i>Release me fast or you will have to
answer for this heinous act</i>
<i>Oh, brother, you're somethin'
You put me in a spin</i>
<i>You aren't comprehending
the position that you're in</i>
<i>It's hopeless, you're finished
You haven't got a prayer</i>
<i>'Cause I'm Mr. Oogie Boogie</i>
<i>And you ain't goin'nowhere</i>
Whoa! It's Jack!
Think of us as you soar
triumphantly through the sky...
outshining every star...
your silhouette
a dark blot on the moon.
You, who are our pride.
You, who are our glory.
- You, who have frightened millions into an early grave.
- Ow!
You, who have, uh...
devastated the,
the souls of the living?
Oh, no! We can't take off in this.
- The reindeer can't see an inch in front of their noses.
- Whew!
This fog's as thick as, as...
- Jellied brains.
- Or thicker!
There go all of my hopes...
my precious plans,
my glorious dreams.
There goes Christmas.
No, Zero. Down, boy.
My, what a brilliant nose you have!
The better to light my way!
To the head
of the team, Zero!
We're off!
Wait, Jack! No!
Ho-ho-ho!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ho!
Good-bye, Jack.
My dearest Jack.
Oh, how I hope
my premonition is wrong.
<i>I sense there's something
in the wind</i>
<i>That feels like
tragedy's at hand</i>
<i>And though I'd like
to stand by him</i>
<i>Can't shake this feeling
that I have</i>
<i>The worst
is just around the bend</i>
<i>And does he notice</i>
<i>My feelings for him</i>
<i>And will he see</i>
<i>How much he means to me</i>
<i>I think it's not to be</i>
<i>What will become
of my dear friend</i>
<i>Where will his actions
lead us then</i>
<i>Although I'd like
to join the crowd</i>
<i>In their enthusiastic cloud</i>
<i>Try as I may it doesn't last</i>
<i>And will we ever</i>
<i>End up together</i>
<i>No, I think not</i>
<i>It's never to become</i>
<i>For I am not the one</i>
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!
Santa!
Santa?
Merry Christmas!
And what is your name?
- Uh, uh, uh, uh...
- That's all right.
I have a special present for you
anyway. There you go, sonny.
Ho-ho-ho-ho!
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!
And what did Santa
bring you, honey?
Merry Christmas!
Hello. Police.
Attacked by Christmas toys? That's strange.
That's the second toy complaint we've had.
Oh! Ha-ha-ha-ha,
ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Oh! Ha-ha-ha-ha,
ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Huh?
Oh, wait!
Whoa! Help! Help!
You're welcome, one and all!
Where'd you spot him?
Fast as we can, ma'am.
Police. I know. I know.
A skeleton. Keep calm.
Turn off all the lights. Make sure
the doors are locked. Hello. Police.
Reports are pouring in
from all over the globe...
that an impostor is shamelessly
impersonating Santa Claus...
mocking and mangling
this joyous holiday.
Authorities assure us
that at this moment...
military units are mobilizing to stop
the perpetrator of this heinous crime.
<i>- Jack! Someone has to help Jack.
- Wherever you are...</i>
<i>- Where'd they take that Sandy Claws?
- Come back and save Christmas.</i>
Look, Zero, searchlights!
They're celebrating!
They're thanking us
for doing such a good job.
Whoa! Careful down there.
You almost hit us!
It's okay, Zero. Head higher.
Are you a gamblin' man, Sandy?
Let's play. Hmm?
My, my! What have we here?
I'll get you out of here.
Ah. Lovely.
Tickle, tickle, tickle.
Uh, tickle, tickle, tickle.
Tickle, tickle, tickle.
Tickle, tickle, tickle.
What? You try to make
a dupe out of me!
Oh!
Who's next on my list?
Ah, little Harry and Jordan.
Won't they be surprised?
They're trying to hit us. Zero!
Merry Christmas to all...
and to all a good night!
I knew this Christmas thing
was a bad idea.
I felt it in my gut.
Terrible news, folks.
The worst tragedy of our times.
Jack has been blown to smithereens!
Terrible, terrible news!
Attention. Attention, citizens.
Terrible news. There's still
no sign of Santa Claus.
Although the impostor
has been shot down...
it looks like Christmas will
have to be cancelled this year.
I repeat, the impostor
has been shot down...
but there's still
no sign yet of Santa.
<i>What have I done</i>
<i>How could I</i>
<i>Be so blind</i>
<i>All is lost</i>
<i>Where was I</i>
<i>Spoiled all</i>
<i>Everything's</i>
<i>Gone all wrong</i>
<i>What have I done</i>
<i>Find a deep cave to hide in</i>
<i>In a million years</i>
<i>They'll find me only dust</i>
<i>And a plaque that reads</i>
<i>Here lies poor old Jack</i>
<i>But I never intended
all this madness</i>
<i>Never</i>
<i>And nobody really understood</i>
<i>Well, how could they</i>
<i>That all I ever wanted was
to bring them something great</i>
<i>Why does nothing ever
turn out like it should</i>
<i>Well, what the heck</i>
<i>I went and did my best</i>
<i>And by God
I really tasted something swell</i>
<i>And for a moment
why, I even touched the sky</i>
<i>And at least I left some stories
they can tell, I did</i>
<i>And for the first time
since I don't remember when</i>
<i>I felt just like
my old bony self again</i>
<i>And I, Jack</i>
<i>The Pumpkin King</i>
<i>That's right, I am the Pumpkin King
Ha-ha-ha-ha</i>
<i>And I just can't wait
until next Halloween</i>
<i>'Cause I've got some new ideas
that will really make them scream</i>
<i>And by god I'm really
going to give it all my might</i>
Uh-oh. I hope there's still time...
to set things right.
Sandy Claws! Hmm.
You wait till Jack
hears about this!
By the time he's through with
you, you'll be lucky if you...
The King of Halloween...
has been blown to smithereens.
Skeleton Jack
is now a pile of dust.
Come on, Zero.
Christmas isn't over yet.
What's that you said
about luck, rag doll?
Help! Help! Help!
Shh.
Looks like it's Oogie's turn
to boogie now.
- Help!
- One, two, three...
four, five, six, seven.
Help!
Ashes to ashes,
and dust to dust.
Oh, I'm feeling weak with hunger!
One more roll of the dice
oughta do it.
What? Snake eyes?
Eleven!
Looks like I won the jackpot!
Bye-bye, doll face and sandman.
What the...
- Hello, Oogie.
- J-J-J-Jack!
But they said you were dead.
You must be double dead!
Oh!
Well, come on, bone man!
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo! Ha!
Fire!
Hmm. Ooh-ooh-ooh!
Jack, look out!
So long, Jack.
How dare you treat my friends
so shamefully!
Now look what you've done!
My bugs! My bugs!
My bugs! My bugs! My bugs!
My bugs! My bugs!
Forgive me, Mr. Claws.
I'm afraid I've made
a terrible mess of your holiday.
Bumpy sleigh ride, Jack?
The next time you get the urge to take over
someone else's holiday, I'd listen to her.
She's the only one who makes any
sense around this insane asylum.
- Skeletons! Boogie men! Ooh.
- I hope there's still time.
To fix Christmas?
Of course there is!
I'm Santa Claus.
He'll fix things, Jack.
He knows what to do.
How did you
get down here, Sally?
Oh, I-I was trying to...
Well, I wanted to, to...
- To help me.
- I couldn't let you just...
Sally, I can't believe
I never realized that you...
- Jack! Jack! -
Here he is! - Alive!
- Just like we said!
- Grab ahold, my boy!
Whoa!
Good news, folks. Santa Claus, the one
and only, has finally been spotted.
Old Saint Nick appears to be
traveling at supersonic speed.
He's setting things right, bringing
joy and cheer wherever he goes.
Yes, folks, Kriss Kringle
has pulled it out of the bag...
and delivered Christmas
to excited children all over the world.
<i>La, la, la, la
La-la-la-la</i>
- Jack!
- Jack's back!
- Jack? - Jack's okay! -
He's all right! - It's Jack!
<i>Jack's okay
And he's back</i>
<i>Oh, yea
He's all right</i>
<i>Let's shout, make a fuss
Scream it out, whee</i>
<i>Jack is back now
Everyone sing</i>
<i>In the town of Halloween</i>
- It's great to be home!
- Ho-ho-ho-ho!
Happy Halloween!
Merry Christmas!
<i>- What's this - What's
this - I haven't got a clue</i>
<i>- What's this
- Why, it's completely new</i>
<i>What's this
Must be a Christmas thing</i>
<i>- What's this
- It's really very strange</i>
<i>This is Halloween
Halloween, Halloween, Halloween</i>
<i>What's this
What's this</i>
Careful, my precious jewel.
<i>My dearest friend
if you don't mind</i>
<i>I'd like to join you by your side</i>
<i>Where we can gaze
into the stars</i>
<i>And sit together</i>
<i>Now and forever</i>
<i>For it is plain</i>
<i>As anyone can see</i>
<i>We're simply meant to be</i>
