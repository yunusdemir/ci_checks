Enough.
Let's bring it up.
The drill is almost here.
Okay.
This is blood!
Lower the drill!
Stop, turn off the engine.
What on earth is it?
Bone fragments?
It's flesh ... from an animal.
It's still fresh.
Something's wrong. I've drilled holes in
the ground for 30 years now, but this...
Look at it there.
A piece of skin ... like leather.
It's very thick.
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know.
Alex, start the generator.
I want to use the radio.
We'll stop drilling until I
find out what it is.
- If there's copper here, it'll have to wait.
- Leave it alone, Svend.
- Some things, you should just stay away from.
- You're being a little superstitious, Henrik.
Well, then, don't come trying to
apologize to me later.
I'll call Radio Narvik and ask them
to send us a palaeontologist.
- They'll never find out what it is.
- Wait and see. Go get the good camera.
I had better get some pictures.
Henrik thinks it's
something supernatural.
Are you superstitious, Mr Klint?
There are more things between heaven and
earth than even a professor can explain.
- You know how journalists are.
- Are you afraid of black cats?
It depends on whether you're
a man ... or a mouse.
This phenomenon is easily explained.
Our test borings have shown us...
that the fossilized bones of some large
creature lie buried near the surface.
How would you explain
the fresh tissue and blood?
Dr. Dalby and I have discussed that.
There is a tundra under the ground.
Parts of the animal must be
contained in it and frozen.
Mammoths and other animals have been found
under the same conditions in Siberia.
What we found wasn't frozen.
It was fresh blood.
Your drill-bit probably
penetrated the deep-frozen animal.
Friction from the drill has thawed it out.
That's how to explain the blood.
Well, then. There's certainly nothing
remarkable in this affair.
On the contrary. All the animals
previously found like this were mammals.
The piece of skin you found, and
the apparent size of the creature,
have convinced us
that it must be a reptile.
- A giant reptile?
- Yes. And that is quite unique.
In the morning, I will send
everything to the Aquarium in Copenhagen,
- Where we can study this find.
The Scandinavian Palaeontological
Society will assist us.
- I'm crawling off to sleep.
- Yeah, we'd better turn in now.
Let me show these gentlemen
to their quarters.
Lisa, your father is too old
for a sardine can like this.
You've been around your fossils
too long, Dad.
With two daughters like mine,
it's a pleasure...
to get back to my old bones.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Good day.
- How are you doing with the jigsaw puzzle?
- I won't give up. It has to fit together.
- It's impossible to reconstruct.
- Surely we have enough bones.
I'm not convinced they all
belong to the same animal.
- But I am.
- Then it's like no other ever found.
Dad, there was
a telegram back home.
Ah. It's from Svend,
the young engineer.
He has found another piece,
600 meters away.
He's bringing it here.
He'll be here in about an hour.
- Shall I meet him at the airport?
- What does he look like?
Awful. Bald as a cue-ball.
But hurry along now.
How will I find him?
Since when must I tell you
how to find a man?
Now, no side errands.
Bring him back directly.
Maybe Svend will bring us
the piece we need.
Let's hope so.
I've really never seen
bone fragments like this before.
They're like hollow tubes. They're strong,
but resilient, like birds' bones.
What about that frozen piece?
I think it's a piece of
the animal's tail.
Come here. I keep it frozen,
or course.
From the size of that piece, we've calculated
that the creature must have been huge.
- How big?
- As big as the largest of dinosaurs.
30 meters or more ... we have an
absolutely unique discovery here.
A piece of a dinosaur,
70, perhaps 100 million years old.
Think what we can learn from it!
Forget the bones. Let's concentrate on this.
Dad, Svend knows enough about frozen things.
Can't I thaw him out a little?
- He's been on ice for too long.
- Your daughter really speaks her mind.
Oh, you'll get used to it.
You'll be staying with us
while you are here.
- How long can you stay?
- Well, I do have a month's leave coming, but...
Dad, here's Mikkelsen
to speak with you.
Karen, please don't frighten
that young man.
I'd better go with you
as a chaperone.
- Ah, Otto, to be 25 years younger...
- Hmm. He'll have his work cut out for him.
Mikkelsen, I am pleased
you could come.
Mr Mikkelsen will help us keep an
eye on things around here.
Someone should be here when
we're not around.
I'll make sure nothing fishy is going on.
Dr. Dalby will explain your duties.
Most important is this freezer. It must
always be kept at the same temperature.
- Ice cold. I'll make sure of it.
- It's all powered electrically.
- Later, you must see the machinery.
- In the meantime, I'll see you later.
OK ... Oh! I get it.
Of course.
Electric eel.
Hello, hello.
I guess everything runs on electricity here.
I think that Svend is the man
I've been looking for all my life.
You said that about Karl, and
Otto, Paul, Henry and that actor.
That was when I was young.
You with your 20 years.
Leave me alone with him, so I'll
know I'm right for him.
When will you ever learn
not to chase a man?
Did you figure that out
when Ole got married to Judy?
I'm sorry, Lise,
I didn't put that very well.
I didn't mean it.
That's just the problem, Karen.
You never think through anything.
Svend is a nice guy.
Now, don't be ridiculous.
This time it's serious.
He is so handsome!
Even Dad likes him.
Lisa, be nice now.
I'll leave you
alone with him tonight.
I think I'll go
help Dad a little.
That's sweet of you. Thank you.
How do I look?
As usual.
Too adorable.
And far too young.
- Is that you, Mikkelsen?
- Just doing my rounds.
You can go.
I'll be working here all night.
Thank you.
- Good night, Doctor.
- Good night, Mikkelsen.
What about your little sister?
- She's such a silly girl.
- Oh, but ...
- Oh ...! What happened?
- Peter! Peter ...!
I must have fallen asleep.
Dr. Dalby,
you really scared me.
Dad, look!
Turn on the light.
It's thawed out.
Completely ruined.
Where is Mikkelsen?
It's not Mikkelsen's fault, Otto.
I sent him home. It's my fault.
Do you realize what you've done?
It is completely thawed.
Decomposition has already begun.
Dad ... Dr. Dalby, look! The wound from
the drill has changed.
It's healing.
Otto! Look at the surface.
Do you realize
what this means?
It's alive. A million years
it's been frozen...
You've let it thaw out,
and now ... now it's alive.
So, are you available, or is there
some little Eskimo girl back home?
- Are you ever serious?
- There isn't much to be serious about.
Life is wonderful.
The sun is shining. Look around you.
We Danes think life is a sweet pastry.
- But it's not.
- Oh, Svend. Smile a little.
You're sweeter when you smile.
I can't just stop thinking.
- Well, then, you have to!
- Will you ever grow up?
I'm pleased to welcome you, Miss Miller.
I'm not accustomed to meeting
such a charming young lady.
My appearance has nothing to do
with my skills.
I was a zoological advisor
for Unesco for 5 years.
I wouldn't dream of suggesting there
was something wrong with your skills.
But allow me to express my
admiration without being misunderstood.
I have a job to do.
Sorry, is that suit the latest
fashion in New York?
If your report can be verified,
it opens up terrible new possibilities.
It is the finest suit
I've ever seen.
- You think so?
- Mm.
Actually, we're expecting another
representative from the UN:
- A general. His name is ...
- Grayson.
Brigadier General Mark Grayson.
I get by in Danish.
My mother was from Denmark.
That's the main reason they
chose me for this ... job.
I have very little idea
what this is all about.
In a few minutes we'll have a
press conference on the matter.
Please allow me to introduce you...
This is Miss Miller.
- American, Miss Miller?
No, I am Danish.
I was sent by Unesco.
My real name is MÃ¸ller, but that's
difficult for an American to say.
- My daughter Lise.
- It's my pleasure.
I hope you enjoy your stay.
Thank you, Miss Martens, but I'll
be happier if my stay is short.
And this is my trusted friend
and colleague, Dr. Peter Dalby.
I'm pleased to meet you.
I know you're busy, General.
But here in this country
we also take time to live.
Thank you. But I put my work first.
Shall we begin?
He's a typical American.
I beg your pardon, Miss Miller.
No need to apologize, professor.
But not all Americans act like that.
I don't understand the general.
He's got a lot on his mind.
And we two must be careful
not to get in his way.
Ladies and gentlemen.
I've invited you here...
to see for yourselves
the evidence
of an historic discovery.
I'll describe it in
sequence, as it occurred...
May I introduce Captain Brandt?
He'll be your liaison officer.
- It's a pleasure.
- Let's hear what Martens is saying.
...I've now had the tail piece
under observation for 7 days.
And there is no doubt:
It is alive!
It's growing amazingly quickly.
It's already doubled its original size.
The tail fragment is in a
tank in the next room.
We've added a nutrient substance.
It's actually a kind of
regeneration chamber.
What do you mean
by "regeneration"?
That's what I'm about to tell you.
Regeneration is the ability
of living tissue to rebuild itself,
or heal a wound.
This capability is highly developed
in certain animal species.
In scientific terms, there
nothing unusual about it.
A lizard may lose
its tail when it's frightened,
and grow a new tail
to replace it.
A starfish can lose an arm,
and a new arm will grow.
An earthworm can be cut into two parts,
and each piece will grow into a new worm.
And that is
what is happening here:
The regeneration
of a living prehistoric animal.
What do you call the creature?
I don't yet know what it will grow into,
apart from the fact it's a reptile.
Why not call it
Reptilicus Martensius?
Reptilicus is enough.
If you want to see it,
it's this way.
Go ahead,
ladies and gentlemen.
Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
Go ahead.
- You don't look happy.
- Would you?
If you were shanghaied into
babysitting a dead herring?
I know why: it's a situation that
just might turn dangerous, eventually.
A prehistoric monster
that grows and grows...
...and could be a threat some day.
Being an errand-boy
for crazy scientists
is not my idea
of a military mission.
The tail is full-grown. The animal is
recreating itself in a fetal position.
It is unlike any other
known type of dinosaur.
The hard scales along its back
are thick.
Its hind legs are strong, while
its forelegs are vestigial.
The most amazing is that two
bat-like wings
are starting to grow
on both sides of its body.
Dr. Dalby has suggested
we increase the supply of nutrients.
We'll try it, though Reptilicus
may grow so large
that it will be necessary
to build it a new tank.
Svend, I will
grow up.
I want to be with you.
I want to be the way you want me to be.
Oh, it's true, Karen,
you have to be an adult.
But I love you
the way you are.
"The whole world is waiting eagerly to see
what this freak of nature will turn into."
"The UN has placed all its knowledge
at the disposal of the Danish government."
"And General Mark Grayson, well-
known from the Second World War,"
"has been given command
of the defense forces."
General Mark Grayson, in
command of 2 captains,
- 3 office boys,
and a dead lizard.
"And General Mark Grayson, well-
known from the Second World War,"
- Hello, Mikkelsen.
- Hello.
"has been given command
of the defense forces."
"And Dirk Mikkelsen has been
given command of 'Tilicus."
Tilicus? Who is Tilicus?
- You don't who Tilicus is?
- Nope.
Ti..li... cus... is...
very famous far and wide.
When... he... pas... ses,
monsters weep and dragons hide.
When he roars,
dinosaurs
run for home and lock their doors.
Don't you make
such a fuss:
Who's afraid of Tilicus?
On... his... back... his...
skin is made of bony scales;
When... they... see... him,
everybody moans and wails.
Razor claws!
Toothy jaws!
Wings a thousand feet across!
Silly man,
scaredy-puss:
Who's afraid of Tilicus?
If... you... see... my...
Tilicus, you'll wet your pants.
You'll... shake, you'll... quake,
like a hokey-pokey dance.
Such a fright, in the night,
eating people left and right...
Don't you be such a wuss:
Who's afraid of Tilicus?
Ti... li... cus... can...
fly as fast as any plane.
He's... so... quick, be-
fore he's gone he's back again!
Think it's fun?
Better run,
or he'll eat you one by one!
Don't be ri-dilicus:
Who's afraid of Tilicus?
Come along, play with us,
running just like Tilicus!
- Is there anything I can do?
- Yeah. Get me out of this chicken outfit.
General, may I suggest you
try to adjust to being here?
I'm here as a soldier.
I'm under orders to be here.
Lise Martens called.
When she comes, show her in.
Ooh! Eee! No! Oww!
Mother! Mo-o-o-m!
Something's happened.
- Tilicus ...
- What happened?
Reptilicus.
What's wrong?
- All right, Mikkelsen.
- I heard something flopping around.
Yes, but Reptilicus han't yet
come back to conscious life.
What you heard was a spontaneous
embryonic movement.
Embry...? I didn't know
lizards did that.
You were right to sound the alarm.
If anything happens again,
then turn it on again.
I heard the alarm.
What happened?
Reptilicus moved.
We've all been working hard, but at
the moment, there's nothing more to do.
You should take a few days' vacation.
I'll stay here and hold the fort.
No; why don't you take the girls
and Svend up to the summer cottage.
Mikkelsen and I will stay here
and babysit the creature.
- Oh, father, you need to rest.
- I suppose you're right.
You should try it yourself,
Peter.
- General, why not come to Tivoli with us?
- Well ...
Okay. We'll pretend we're
American tourists.
Tivoli night
oh, what a sight
all Copenhagen
is dancing
laughter and light
come, hold me tight
this is a place
for romancing
down by the lake
lovers dream to a song
like they were doing
when grandma was young
Tivoli night
Tivoli moon
life is entrancing
when we're romancing

you're all dressed up
and with a smile on your face
you look as gay as can be
soon you'll be going
to a wonderful place
you've got a date there
my honey, with me

Professor Martens, the creature...
I just can't get it out of my mind.
Now look here, Svend,
we are here to relax.
-- like those two over there.
Why aren't you with them?
Leave the dull past to me...
And think about the future instead.
Yeah.
Watch out, General Grayson! Lisa Martens'll
give you something to think about.
- Hello.
- Welcome.
Thanks for having us.
Come inside
and have a drink.
It's this way.
Hello?
Hello? ... Hello?
Hello?
Mikkelsen, go get the police.
The phone is disconnected.
Olsen, it's moving!
It's alive!
Be a good man and close the door.
Send for the professors,
colonels, generals, the whole army.
- Must you drag the bike in here, too?
- It rode me here.
The electricity's out all over.
- Oh, ah?
- Even the electric eel!
- Oh, ah?
- It was so dark, I couldn't see
my own face in front of me.
- Oh, ah?
There was just a big hole in the wall.
The monster is loose!
Why don't you tell all that to Dr. Dalby?
He's the one that sent me here
in the first place!
Dr Dalby?
- They didn't find any trace of him.
- What happened?
Reptilicus must have undergone
a tremendous growth spurt.
- He's come out of hibernation.
- How could it be?
I don't know.
Maybe the electrical charge of the
stormy weather?
Perhaps the increased supply
of nutrients.
I've followed its tracks. They led
down to the shore and disappeared.
All right, Captain.
We've got a fight on our hands.
I want to set up HQ in the city.
Where do you suggest?
- The barracks of the Royal Guards.
- Good.
Gentlemen ...
You all have your orders.
I'm taking command
over the army,
with Capt. Brandt as
my liaison officer.
Commander Angdal is
awaiting orders for the fleet.
The same applies to the Air Force.
And the Chief of Police must
handle the evacuation of the populace.
The country will stay on
the highest alert.
Professor Martens and Svend Alstrup
will be my scientific and
technical advisors.
- Any questions?
- No.
I'll convene another meeting,
if it becomes necessary.
Carry on, gentlemen ...
Brandt, I want that radio
manned 24 hours a day.
- General Grayson.
Where? ... Stay out of his way.
We're leaving at once.
Brandt,
red alert in area A.
Reptilicus is running amok.
Come on, Svend.
- What happened?
- It killed 14...
- 14 of my best heifers.
- It did?
It was mighty big.
It destroyed my barn
and disappeared over there.
Get everybody out of here,
in case it comes back.
What was that?
Brandt calling.
I'm just leaving D sector.
Permission to go into sector E,
Area 1? Over.
Brandt, check sector E,
Area 4 Out.
Understood. Out.
Cars 7 and 9, follow me.
The others, go that way.
Let's get moving.
Mark, look over there!
We'll go this way.
Mark ...!
I've found it.
It's ...
My god!
Let's go, Svend.
Machine gun in position. There.
RAR! I'm a monsta!
Spread out!
<b>RAR!!!</b>
Cannons in position.
Give him everything you've got.
Keep firing.
Be ready to get out of here in a hurry.
Cease firing.
Cease firing.
We didn't even dent him.
- It's headed for the beach.
- Those bony scales are like armor plate.
We're gonna need a bigger cannon.
Brent ...
Can we get to the beach before he does?
- We can try.
- Report to Captain Brandt.
He can't be far away.
Is he coming here?
Yes, if he keeps on going
toward the beach.
- Where can he be?
- There he is.
Come on, come on.
Is that Mark?
RAR!
Perhaps it's so badly injured
it will die.
No, Reptilicus would just go
lick its wounds.
- Regeneration?
- Soon it will return.
Perhaps it will use its wings
next time.
So it's a cross between
one of these animals and a flying lizard.
More than that.
Some 70 million years ago
nature went through a long period
of experimentation.
I believe Reptilicus is
one of nature's attempts
to bridge the step from reptiles
to mammals.
We can not have the monster
moving around freely.
But first, it must be found.
The Aquarium has a motorboat...
With an underwater television camera.
We use the
to study the seabed.
It shows
what we pass over.
I want to install it
on one of the navy's vessels.
- Ah. Shall I take it from here?
- Go ahead, Professor.
I suggest you concentrate your search
on the shore next to Aquarium.
- Why, doctor?
- Because Reptilicus will undoubtedly
return to the Aquarium.
Instinctively, it will
feel attracted to this place.
I think we should try it.
Anything new?
- It's been almost a week.
- Why don't you go home?
- I prefer to stay here.
- You're stubborn!
I suppose.
Just like you.
Hey, look!
There it is!
- Watch-Captain Nielsen calling.
- Put it on speaker.
Reptilicus observed in shallow
water. Awaiting further orders.
Grayson here.
Execute Plan A.
Aft mortar ... fire!
Aft mortar ... fire!
Turn and goes back;
prepare for a new attack.
- Mark, are they bombing him?
- Of course.
This time we'll get the monster.
Don't you realize what you're doing?
Mark, stop them.
Ferry me out to the...
ARGH!
Forward mortar ... fire.
If the monster is blown
into bits, it will regenerate itself.
Each piece will grow
into a whole new monster.
Watch-Captain Nielsen,
this is Grayson.
Stop the attack.
Cease firing.
He's won this round.
But not the whole game.
Can't we do anything
while it is under water?
No. I wanted to get him
while he was still injured.
I'll have to wait for the right moment,
I know,
when the creature is fully recovered.
Until Reptilicus chooses
to fight us again.
Maybe Dad will find a solution.
Alstrup.
Yes?
Yes ... Right away, yes.
- What is it?
- It's your father.
He's been taken to the hospital.
He's had a serious heart attack.
Come on... I'll take you to him.
No. ...
Connie, go with her.
I've got work to do.
Mark, you really must call it a day.
It's past 10.
I'm just about finished.
It's been two weeks, and you haven't
budged from this place.
- Let him sleep.
- Still no news?
We've got a ring
of observation posts.
Reptilicus can't get out of the area
without us knowing it.
Martens says that the creature could
turn up any time now.
- I know. How is the professor?
- Getting along fine.
- Mark, the creature has been spotted!
- Where?
A Swedish trawler reported him
here, on the way to the southwest.
Mark... the monster is flying.
Alert all observation posts.
Brandt, inform the cities at risk:
Kiel, LÃ¼beck, Hamburg.
...leaving the German coast.
On course for the Baltic Sea.
Direction Northeast.
Observation Post 2-7. Out.
Alert.
Keep all forces in readiness.
But do not open fire, unless
the monster is trying to come up on land.
Chief, instruct your policemen to
keep the people out of the way.
I don't want anybody on the streets.
Complete blackout.
We've got to attract the
creature's attention somehow.
- It's like in an hour!
- I know.
Send word to Oslo and Stockholm.
They are at risk now.
Press Radioavisen.
I have an important message.
Reptilicus is flying over Hamburg
toward Copenhagen.
Police are asking the people
to cooperate with the blackout.
If the animal is flying overhead,
it is important that no lights
attract the creature's attention.
Stay out of the streets
and comply with the blackout.
There's no reason to panic.
The situation is under control.
Yes?
I can understand that you don't
want to paralyze the city.
But keep all activities
to the barest minimum.
Where is that damned monster?
He's approaching the city.
This is Grayson.
calling all units.
Hold your fire!
I repeat,
hold your fire!
This is Grayson. Calling line 3-9.
Place your report. Over.
Post call 3-9
headquarters.
Reptilicus is leaving the town,
flying high. Over.
- Which direction? Over.
- Flying to the north. Over.
- Oslo? Over.
- More Northeast. Over.
Thank you. That is all. Out.
Get me Stockholm.
There! Just there in the Sound!
He's dived down again.
- That's near the Aquarium.
- Your father was right.
All that searching, and here it is
right in our own back yard.
But we've learned of attacks
on Hamburg and Stockholm.
We must find a way
to stop the beast.
- What is it, Svend?
- Hamburg, Stockholm ...
Where next? I had the blood
of the monster on my hands.
Sometimes I feel that I have
all those other people's blood
on my hands, too.
- No, Svend.
- I wish I had left it alone.
- I found it!
- And dad brought it here.
Karen, if we get out of all this
in one piece...
- Will you ...
- No, not if, but when.
And then, yes.
- Where is the line?
- 53-5. 16-8.
Z-31.
E-32.
Ø-32.
RAR!
Reptilicus has already
reached Christianshavn.
We can't use any
of our heavy weapons.
RAR!
We must get something in the air,
in case the monster starts flying.
Mark? It can't fly any more.
The creature's wings are torn up.
The creature secretes a substance
that reduces the effect of the flames.
- Just what father was afraid of.
- All right, you have your orders.
- Where is it headed now?
- Towards Langebro.
Let's go.
Close the bridge, Svend.
Look there!
Tell Brandt to take over command.
We're going back to headquarters.
We only have one chance.
We can't stop Reptilicus
with small arms or field pieces.
We'll destroy him
with our heavy weapons.
- The creature is here now.
- The Stock Exchange!
Spead out.
The devastation
will be terrible.
We have no choice.
Get me Captain Brandt.
Captain ... Headquarters.
Brandt here.
...Yes, Mark.
Understood.
We're doing our best. Out.
Grenades just bounce off it.
Nothing has any effect on the monster.
- Fire! He's turning!
- It's coming this way.
Fire!
It's impossible.
It's heading right for us! Fire!
Call Captain Brandt.
Tell him to report here.
This is our line of defense.
Brandt, we must concentrate
all our firepower along this line.
Reptilicus is coming out of
the suburbs.
We have to prevent him from
returning to the city.
Nobody along this line
is to open fire on the monster --
- Unless it tries
to return to the city.
Nobody fire on the creature
before it's absolutely necessary.
And then, everybody must open fire
at the same time.
There he is!
Hold your fire ...!
- It's broken through the line.
- What happened?
- Somebody opened fire against my orders.
The creature went after them
before Brandt could bring any
concentrated firepower to bear.
- Are you evacuating the city?
- It's impossible.
- Are the streets passible?
- Many are blocked. There's panic.
We've got to stop him!
What if I use my heavy bombs?
It will cost thousands
of lives.
You can't do that.
We cannot use bombs.
- Father!
- Stay calm, my dear.
I'm all right.
General Grayson,
You have to understand ...
...Reptilicus must not
be blown into pieces.
Then how should I
destroy it?
Not with explosives.
I am a soldier, not a scientist.
That's the only way I know.
- So you must learn another.
- All right, then tell me.
- I can't.
- Then we'll do it my way.
We'll lure the animal out of town. Some
bombs will take care of him.
You want to blow him into 1000 pieces?
Each piece is a new disaster.
We'll pick up every little piece
and destroy them.
How are you going to find them all?
They'll be scattered to the four winds.
Better 1000 tiny fragments
than one giant monster.
What about 1000 giant monsters?
Can you guarantee that you
will find all the pieces?
How long do you expect me
to continue this hell?
Call Captain Brandt.
Command center.
Give me Captain Brandt.
Captain?
Brandt? Mark here.
Give me a situation report.
It's hard to keep him away.
I can't do anything.
Try anyway. I want an
accurate assessment of the situation.
Understood. Out.
Let's go over it again.
He doesn't reply, General.
Keep calling.
- How is your father?
- They gave him a sedative.
- What about Reptilicus?
- If only we could sedate it.
- Anesthetize it?
- Just joking, Mark.
No, wait. You've hit on something.
Is there a drug
that can knock Reptilicus out?
Yes, but we'd need at least 1 liter of it,
and we'd have to get it into his bloodstream.
- Can we get enough of it?
- I think we can manage that.
They have everything we need
At the University laboratory.
If we knock Reptilicus out,
your father can destroy him, right?
Yes.
- One liter? It is impossible.
- I have an idea.
I'll tell you on the way
to the University.
First we have to get ahold of
someone who knows about these drugs.
Captain,
follow these instructions.
- The Laboratory?
I don't know anything about it.
- Lise knows it. Take her with you.
Bring it to the University
laboratory immediately.
- Have you been in contact with Brandt?
- Not yet.
Tell him
I am at the University.
- We're coming with you
- No, it's too dangerous.
- We must stick together.
- We can't take the risk!
Mark! Now science and the
military must work together.
I don't know if this is going to work.
We'll have to try it and see.
- While you're trying, what then?
- Should we just stand and wait?
- Lise knows the University.
- All right. Come on.
RAR!
- Here it is.
- Bring it here.
- Now what?
- Now we take a crack at Reptilicus.
The bazooka rocket. Svend has
removed most of the explosive --
- And replaced it with a drug...
If we can get it into his bloodstream,
...it will knock him unconscious.
But his scales are as thick
as armor plates. How ...?
There's one place:
his mouth.
So you'll have to fire point blank.
Come on.
There he is.
Now's our chance for a good shot.
Prepare the grenade.
...Get out of here! That's an order.
If we fail here,
we'll need you.
Load.
He's turning away!
Now we'll have to outflank him.
No, we must get to him before
he gets out of the square.
> SQUISH <
He's coming back this way!
Quickly!
