Previously on the Shattered
Gun!
- Freeze!
- Shoot!
Ben, why'd you tell me to shoot?
It wasn't me.
We're looking for a Dr. Kuo.
We're detectives.
We'd like a word with him.
- You okay?
- No.
Getting back together with you
is so far from being on the table.
Can I see you later?
Not tonight.
Hey, honey, I'm on my way.
- Who's Naomi?
- No idea.
I'm Ben's wife.
I don't know a Ben.
H-harry. - Harry has a wife?
What, you couldn't find
something less damaging to do?
Roller derby, book club?
You sure you're okay?
Let me take a look at you.
You're going to need stitches.
I'm good.
You got your gun?
Yup.
Good.
It was a hell of a party.
Did you have fun at least?
"Lawrence Copeland."
Yeah? Ring any bells?
No.
Thanks for coming so fast.
I couldn't call my wife.
It's all right,
saved me from hot yoga.
- Does this happen often?
- Huh?
- Does this happen often?
- Come here often?
- You're an idiot.
- Thank you.
Do you think all this
blood is from you?
Look, stay here, I got him.
Get off of me!
Hey, hey, hey,
it's okay, it's okay.
I don't know, man,
we were having fun,
everything was cool.
You... You flipped out,
and I took a swing at you, okay?
Anybody else get hurt?
I just want to get my bag.
Who was that guy?
Totally unrelated.
Do you know where your car is?
I got a good idea.
Check around back!
You okay?
I have to pick up my
wife from the airport...
Get an ETA on the ambulance.
Requesting a code three ambulance.
East Side hallway,
we got a man down.
Severe puncture wound,
unconscious.
I'm going to check for more.
Hang on.
Come on, come on...
So the security guard's
name is Gita Singal.
He's been with the
company for three years,
no complaints, you know,
model-type guy.
T.C. says the Feds are
looking at any connection
between this attack and those
other bombings up the coast.
They want us to rule
him out as a suspect.
So basically they want
us to go in there,
talk to the wife and
ask if her dying husband
is the una-bomber?
Basically.
All right.
There's a bomb
and suddenly the
"Brown boy" is a suspect?
In case you've forgotten,
Gita is a victim, Detective.
I'm not pointing any fingers here.
I didn't say that
he was a suspect.
You didn't have to.
To help me confidently say
that Gita was not involved
in this situation,
I'm going to have to ask
you a few questions.
Look, someone did
this for a reason.
Whatever that reason may be,
his presence there may
help us understand that.
Did he have any enemies
that you know of?
He gets along with everyone.
He's not political at all.
He's a security guard
to pay for his music studies.
Somebody help!
He didn't make it.
Have you considered yoga?
Mindfulness, healthy eating,
stress reduction.
You should give it a go.
Your car, how do you
want to deal with that?
That's my problem.
It always does this.
- Want a donut?
- Yeah?
- Okay. Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- They're messy.
- Yeah, I see that.
You weren't kidding.
How's your head?
- After you.
- Sorry.
Gordon, hi.
I see you've met our detectives,
Sullivan and Lynch?
Yeah, elevator got stuck.
Got a donut though.
Great...
All these Feds are coming in
because of the bomb signature?
Killing innocent people,
craziness.
How's Ella?
She's fine, why?
No, just, you know,
"How's Ella?" that's all.
Well, she's fine.
Good.
Here, I'll give this to
you in the short strokes.
All right.
Two days ago, some guy at the
Environmental Agency there
opens up a box, and boom,
now this.
All right, you guys, cover it up!
Would you stop gossiping already?
We're waiting for you.
Yes, you're beautiful, Terry.
What did she say?
She said I'm beautiful.
Beautiful.
All right, everybody, listen up.
Past targets include
two different banks,
a shipping company
from the east coast,
and a Shell Oil office.
Tangential relationships,
no direct links yet made.
Sullivan.
I know.
Excuse me?
Hi. Dr. Ryan Disilvio.
Psychiatric assessment and
analysis for the unit.
I've put together a pretty
comprehensive profile.
If you like, I can walk
your guys through it.
Uh... My behavioral science team
has put together a
statistically sound profile
based on a proprietary algorithm.
You know, you can read
about it if you like, Doc,
But, hey, you're doing good work.
Really, good work.
But we are on a ticking
clock here, folks.
By my estimation,
we got about 43 hours before
the next one goes off.
43?
Did I miss something?
Yeah, the lessons of 9/11.
This case has just been
bumped from orange to red
so we like to work from
a worst-case scenario,
anticipating contingencies.
Public safety is our only concern.
My guys will take the, uh,
big-picture stuff off your hands.
And we'll take the
secondary canvas,
security video,
victim statements, good?
Good.
All right,
let's go make an arrest.
Banner...
Where did you all go?
To pick up security video
from the businesses.
From the local area?
Eddy? Do me a favor.
Uh... Run a registration
number for me.
868726, Lawrence Copeland.
Yeah.
Look, uh, send it to my email.
Yeah. Okay, good.
Banner's an ass.
You're good.
I've dealt with worse.
No, what Banner is single-minded.
Guy thinks he knows the answer,
so he's only going to look
at the facts that fit.
You think different?
I do.
The feds are looking
for a big conspiracy,
but what if our guy
is small scale?
What if this is personal?
What if he's waging
his own private war,
and we just haven't
gained the necessary
insight to understand it.
You think he's working alone?
I do.
But everybody's got a family.
And our guy hasn't
killed before today.
Maybe if we're lucky,
someone will come forward
once they realize
that people are dying.
Thank you.
Look for someone who cares.
Right.
I got the footage from
every security cam and ATM
in a 10-block radius of
the building that blew.
So we get to sift through all this
try to find a nut-job
in a haystack?
Well, when some big corporation
has its financial foot on
the neck of the little guy,
why is everyone so surprised
when he fights back?
So, you're justifying
what this guy did?
Am I getting that right?
No, all I'm saying is,
I understand.
Hey, bud, you're in my chair.
Oh, my jacket! Seriously?
Seriously.
Can I get you a coffee
or something, donut?
Look, don't touch anything, okay?
I have a system here,
and I need you to respect that.
Thanks. Any damage?
Great. No, I'll pick
it up in an hour or so.
- Your car?
- Yeah.
Where'd they find it?
Alley off Hastings.
That's a nice part of town...
Whoa, what happened to you?
You look like crap.
Hot yoga. I'm in a program.
Look, maybe you should, uh,
help them out with these.
I think there's 20
different formats.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Hey, listen, I got a situation.
I gotta pick up my car
from the impound lot.
I know. It's a long story.
Look, I hate to ask you this,
but I'm getting dogged with
phone calls so I gotta.
I'm like a thousand bucks short
on my kids' private
school payments, and...
- You need money?
- Yeah.
You got it.
Thanks.
Linda...
- Ella, it's good to see you.
- You too.
So, uh, what is this place?
Uh, Victim Services.
I'm a counselor.
Kind of like a social worker.
Ah. Well, considering
where you and I came from,
good for you.
Life's treating you well.
Yeah, I'm a fully licensed
design consultant.
I sell pillow and chair coverings
to the rich and not so famous.
Sorry I fell off the map.
No, you got married,
and had a kid, and...
I read about what happened.
Big manhunt,
a cop's son and all.
I was going to call you.
Oh, we'll find him.
- We will.
- Yeah...
Listen, Ella,
are you sure about this?
I mean, why dial back the clock
when you've been clean so long?
None of my business.
I gotta go, but, um...
Next time, we'll...
we'll talk, catch up.
Okay.
Why didn't Terry get stuck
doing this with you?
I mean, not... sorry, not stuck.
You know what I mean.
Okay, weirdo on
Nick Ducet's blog...
Listen to this...
"We have to ask the question,
is Al-Qaeda here?"
Jake103...
I thought there was a media ban.
"I say we catch these guys.
Put 'em in a field
and blow 'em up.
An eye for an eye... "
That's fear for you.
It's a magnet that skews
the moral compass.
You into hot yoga, too?
Yeah. So what of it?
Well, it's good that
you're... limber.
I can put my legs behind my head.
- You all right there?
- Yeah.
"If these people feel so
strongly about their cause,
may I suggest they go
back to their homeland."
Beteebb102.
Terrible.
Is Ben all right?
He doesn't look too good.
Yeah. Why?
Well, you're not exactly
his lucky charm.
Hey, look, don't take
this the wrong way, okay?
I think you're cool,
but ever since you two
partnered up, it's been...
Well, you know,
you're all up in it.
Does that look right to you?
When have you ever seen
a bike courier 6:30
in the morning?
It's weird, right?
Corporate camaras ran the service
probably not a coincidence,
so we got this from a surveillance
camera across the street.
Courier companies have no
record of any deliveries.
Our profile algorithm suggests
white, over 40,
University educated,
and mentally unstable.
That's great work...
Any of your computer
algorithms equipped
to cross-reference actual
real-live human beings?
Disgruntled employees, say?
30,000 international employees
between the companies targeted,
but our geeks are running it.
Folks, this stuff is
class a sensitive, so
media ban is in effect.
Thank you very much.
- Whose baby carrots are these?
- Mine.
- Can I?
- Yeah.
Spiking a tree will make
a logger think twice
about picking up a chainsaw,
But corporations aren't
going to think twice
about being corporations.
So what's he disrupting?
It's a warning.
Rattle the cage,
unsettle the employees.
So it's personal.
It affects him personally.
It's a principle or an ideology
that somehow he...
Okay, we got a tip.
All manpower's been dep...
- You get those from the fridge?
- Yeah.
Those are mine.
All manpower's been deployed,
except for you, Lynch.
You can go see Hall.
Terry, we got a tip
about the bomber...
Let's go, let's go...
You find a needle in a haystack,
and they want two...
Hmm, "Corporations are
the primary evil..."
Uh, "As population increases,
the obvious outcome is more war."
"WW3 is inevitable..."
These are more crazies
from Nick Ducet's blog.
"Imagine he's just like you.
Someone with family."
Except for the fact
that he's killed a man.
Same blogger...
"No matter what he's done,
he's a human being."
A sympathizer.
The date of the postings are
the same day as the bombings.
"His fight is for all of us,
more than you know.
Actions speak louder than words."
Whoever wrote that
either knows the bomber,
or is the bomber.
That's the second floor.
Stairs?
All secured fire doors going down,
and you can't go up without
going through security doors,
and electronic locks
and stuff like that.
Thanks.
Nobody comes in!
Nobody comes in!
Hey, stop that guy!
Somebody go around the back end.
Meth lab.
Wrong number, wrong guy.
Good bust, though.
Yeah. This way.
C4...
Has he used C4 in any other bombs?
No, not yet.
Looks like he's
stepping up his game.
Yeah. Great.
To force him to give us
access to his database,
we'll need a warrant.
No.
There's not a chance
we'll get it in time.
Hall, talk to Ducet
Pucker up, maybe he'll play ball.
Can't promise to pucker up,
but I'll work something out.
All right.
Lynch, Ben needs
you on the search.
Garrett...
Look, I'm a journalist.
I'm inclined to
protect my sources.
It's a blog, Nick,
he or she is not
considered a source.
Well, that's a matter
of perspective, right?
He or she is free
to make comments,
that's the whole point.
The whole entire
paradigm of the internet
is based on the
notion of free speech.
Look, we can always
get a subpoena, okay,
and you keep that up,
we'll add an obstruction
charge, too.
- Oh...
- Oh, yes.
I don't know how much
they're paying you,
but legal fees, they do tend
to add up pretty quickly.
Know what I'm saying?
Not on my dime.
I work for a newspaper
with a whole war room
full of legal beagles.
You know what I'm saying?
Ah... All right.
- I'll give you an exclusive.
- All right.
It'll have to be bullet proof.
Our guys raided a storage...
Wait a minute.
I got this.
All right.
Oh, now I know they're
not paying you.
Our guys raided a
storage place today.
The bomber was there,
but we missed him.
You can't use my name, Nick.
No.
Now, all you've gotta do
is respond to the
comment on your blog.
We can trace it from there.
It's that easy, huh?
Hey, it wouldn't be fair
if technology didn't
work for our side, too.
Thank you.
Eddy said that registration
you were looking for,
the car belongs to a
Lawrence Copeland,
Aka "Spanky,"
And he is a pimp who
works the hastings strip.
Wouldn't be a coincidence
that your car was found
abandoned in the same area?
'cause I know about that, too.
I'm not on a
"Need to know" basis, Ben.
How you doing, detective...
You talk to me quickly,
you talk to me.
It's Spanky.
You got him pissed off, man.
He's mad that he lent you his car.
Oh, you screwed up bad.
So, what, does the department know
that you're out there,
Moonlighting?
I work undercover.
I'm a junkie, I'm not a moron!
Spanky is saying something
about some money that's missing.
Okay, shut up.
Shut your mouth.
I'll talk to my supervisor,
And I'll get you
out of here, okay,
And you forget that you saw me,
I forget that I saw you...
Yeah, what, you had
to think about that?
This is a list
of the most vulnerable
corporate locations.
Now, we're going to
need as much manpower
deployed as humanly possible.
We've got two ert
teams equipped with
bomb squad units already roving,
and we're going to need
way more than that.
You want to use our
people to look for bombs?
Find it, yeah, don't move it.
Oh, and, uh, let's use the term
"Improvised explosive
device," Okay?
It kind of... takes the edge off,
You know?
Takes the edge off...
What is this place anyway?
They manufacture pipe
for gas transport.
"Highly probable target."
That's what Banner says.
Ben?
It's probably nothing,
but I stepped on something.
Okay, don't move.
Don't move.
- Ben?
- It's nothing.
What is it... - Nothing.
Nothing.
There's nothing there.
I think I should call someone...
No, it's okay.
There's nothing there.
What is it?
Something. It's been triggered.
Come here
Evacuate the area.
We have a bomb,
a tank of hydrazine.
Detonation one minute, 11 seconds.
Evacuate the area.
Can we do something?
Hydrazine.
The whole block will go up.
We need a bomb disposal
team in there now.
We've got less than a minute
to evacuate everyone we can.
We need to run.
We need to run.
We need to run...
We need to run.
No, no, no.
Ben, we need to run.
There is no point.
No point...
At the end of the game,
the king and the pawn
go in the same box.
It's a bomb, it's a bomb!
Bomb... I don't wanna...
I don't wanna die,
I don't wanna die...
Ben! Ben!
Do something! Fix it!
I need you to help me!
Ben! Ben!
I need you to help me, okay?
I'm not afraid of
my own mortality.
It's the act of
dying I'm afraid of.
I've accepted my mortality.
I have.
I'm not afraid...
Ben, we need to get out of here.
It's the act of
dying I'm afraid of...
It's the act of dying
that I'm afraid of...
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
They talk way too much.
Hey guys, catch this up.
Watch
Watch the crackheads
smashing the Benz, watch.
You've got to get out more...
No, no, wait for it, wait for it.
All right, I guess so.
Give me a break, man.
Let's see the guy on the left.
I busted that dude just last week!
Don't you guys have
something better to do?
Where'd you get that?
It was on your desk.
Don't take things off my desk.
What, you think that's funny?
You're fine.
Hey, check it out,
we tracked down Ducet's blogger,
Teresa Napier.
She's agreed to come down
first thing tomorrow morning.
Good work.
Uh, what did that cost?
A little leakage,
you know what I'm sayin'?
Let's work on the
interview strategy.
All right. Where did Lynch go?
Let's... Let's start without her.
All right, the blogger
that's coming in,
Teresa Napier,
she has a brother, Oliver.
Single, in his 40s,
he was a chemistry
major in college,
and he's currently unemployed.
He has no significant
relationships
other than his sister.
Isolated, loner,
fits Ryan's profile.
- Good work.
- All right.
I'm Amy Lynch, I'm Ben's partner.
Nice to meet you.
Thanks for meeting me.
Ben and I almost died tonight.
He saved my life,
and a lot of others.
- So he's a hero?
- Not really, no.
Since we've been partnered,
his behavior's been...
inconsistent.
Unstable.
- Is he a good detective?
- Yeah, he is.
But he's... coming apart,
literally.
I mean, he changes,
his-his voice, the way he moves.
I'd swear he has
multiple personalities.
So he should seek
professional help
and maybe ruin his career?
Before something
terrible happens, yeah.
If you don't feel
safe with my husband,
maybe you should
transfer out of the unit?
Okay...
The other night, Ben went for a
joyride in someone else's car.
Watch it.
You're his wife.
He needs you to help him.
Do something.
Did you know that
the pipeline company
that just about blew up last night
was awarded a contract
for a deep water
gas import facility yesterday?
In English.
Thank you.
Massive tankers pull up,
they unload thousands
of tons of natural gas.
Five miles off-shore.
An environmental disaster
just waiting to happen.
So, let me guess,
the other targeted
companies are involved,
and the environmental agency
rubber-stamped the permit.
Nice work.
Chicks dig it.
Want to talk about the
surveillance tape?
- What tape?
- Thank you.
Remember back in '95,
Greenpeace forced Shell
to reverse a decision,
a David and Goliath story.
Yeah, but they used the media.
I mean, nobody's
claiming this, right?
Maybe he's stoking the fire.
That bomb last night would have
spread toxic gas through
the entire west end.
Plenty of collateral
damage and press.
Maybe the guy's a fisherman, huh?
It completes the metaphor.
But David had a slingshot.
Look, you got resources,
so why don't we start
on ports and marinas?
Okay, sure...
And, uh, did I not say
"Media ban?"
That your blogger?
Yeah, Hall got her
name from Ducet.
Let me guess.
Someone had to do a deal
with the devil, right?
Anything else?
I need a favor.
One of my informants...
picked up on a drug bust.
I need him out on the street.
Where's the paperwork at?
Hasn't been filed yet.
Yeah, I'll take care of it...
as a favor.
Thank you.
Sorry about that.
Okay.
Don't worry.
Um, what did you say...
You said had two kids,
and your husband's
out of the picture?
I have a boy.
He's 10.
You're an environmentalist.
I respect our planet, yes.
We're really making a
mess of it, aren't we?
Well, sometimes,
you've got to fight.
You know, it starts
with the little guy
taking responsibility, right?
Yeah.
That's what you teach
your kids, huh?
Yes.
She's getting edgy, look at her.
She's moving around...
Yeah, but that's good.
You've got to get in there
and you got to keep her down.
Come on, I was just venting.
Yeah, but if you know who did it,
and you don't come forward,
you're just as responsible.
You said you were close
with your family.
You have a brother?
Yes.
Um, tell me about him.
Does he also believe
that actions speak
louder than words?
My brother is a very peaceful man.
I never said he wasn't.
I'm vibrating.
Yeah...
No.
No, I'm not.
No, that's not...
This brother,
do we know anything about
him at all, anything?
He hasn't collected a
paycheck in about three years
and he's listed as a member of several
environmental activist groups.
Right.
So, basically, nothing.
Oh, here we go.
You're going to take
me downstairs, right?
No, I was just waiting
for my next interview.
Do you mind if I just
wait in here with you?
Thanks. I'm Amy.
Teresa...
Here, you must be thirsty.
- I haven't touched it.
- Oh, thanks.
How'd it go with my partner, Ben?
He can be kind of harsh.
I don't think I was very helpful.
Nick Ducet, the crime guy,
he called the bomber
a terrorist threat
on his blog site,
and I guess your partner there
thought that I might
know something, so...
That's because I wrote some stuff.
Yeah, I read it, too.
"Imagine he's just like you.
Someone with family?"
Omission's also lying, Teresa.
That's risky. She's gotta...
She's got to pull back there.
Look at her, look at her face.
Oliver, that's my brother,
He's, um...
He's such a...a sweet gentle soul.
He lives on his boat.
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
the boat? There's a boat?
He, loves nature...
- We got the boat?
- No, wait.
- He's an environmentalist?
- Oh yeah.
Capital "G" for green.
This is Gita and Arisha.
Arisha lost her husband
because of the bomb.
And hundreds more could have died
because of another bomb.
And you think it's my brother?
Absolutely not possible.
Look, I trust him with my kids.
He's anything but dangerous.
But you're not sure, right?
Because otherwise,
why would you feel
compelled to publicly
defend a bomber?
A social activist.
Some might call him a terrorist.
She's pushing a little hard here.
I'm, uh, I'm not
under arrest, right?
This is just an interview.
That's right.
It's just that it's about
responsibility, Teresa.
I mean, if your boys
were here right now,
what would you want
them to see you do?
What kind of example is their
uncle setting for them?
Push.
He's my brother.
My little brother.
But if he's our man,
and more people die.
His world changes. Yours too.
You can't go back from that.
Can you live with that?
You won't hurt him?
That's what we're
trying to avoid...
Oh, she's good.
She's got her.
But we need you to help us.
Look, we're going on a guess,
so we're going to have to be
prepared for anything, right?
Right. Understood.
Will you?
All right, everybody,
you know what to do.
Get those eyes on the roof.
All right, you guys
head down the left side,
I've got guys going
down the right.
He's got a blue courier bag.
Okay, here comes the brother.
First, we got a positive ID?
Yeah. Okay, ETA... ETA 30 seconds.
Yeah, okay, it's him.
Test, test?
Good to go.
Okay, everybody assume
he has a bomb in the bag.
You're doing the right thing.
Am I?
How's the sister?
I don't think we
should send her in.
I mean, if he has a bomb,
he's brought her here for
a very specific reason.
It's unlikely he's
going to do anything
with the sister close by, right?
We get him on the wire,
we move in.
If that bag is full,
the blast is going to
harm innocent people.
You don't know my brother.
He'd never do this.
Teresa is moving in.
You don't know my brother...
All right, Terry, on your left...
Talk to that teacher,
get the kids out of there ASAP...
Ben, where are you going?
Keep your eyes on Sullivan.
What is she doing?
Did you do anything, Oliver?
They say you did something.
Let me see in your bag.
What are you doing?
Okay, those are books in the bag.
Repeat, books in the bag.
There is no bomb in the bag.
I told you my brother
wasn't the bomber!
They got to you, didn't they?
You didn't do anything,
did you, Oliver?
What they're doing,
all of them, is wrong,
And you know it!
Oh, my God, it was you.
How could you know
they were lying...
What's Ben doing?
What is he doing?
Lynch...
Get the sister out of there.
You should run now.
No...
Oliver...
He's walking away.
Hey...
Hey!
Oliver!
You wanna talk?
Still want to talk?
They drop me,
and this goes off.
So you wanna save the world, huh?
All right, why can't I hear?
Come on, somebody
give me something.
Didn't save his world.
No right way to do
the wrong thing.
Do the right thing.
What's he saying?
You should do the right thing.
Pussy.
Keep your eyes on Sullivan.
You were wrong to think
they wouldn't sell you out
You were wrong all
along can't you see...
..Yeah, no, don't worry about it.
I talked with Ben,
and it's sorted.
Okay.
I'll drop by there and pick 'em up
on the way home if you want.
What do you need?
Yeah, the pink box
with the white swirl.
Thanks.
No, no, I wasn't-
I wasn't talking to you,
I was just...
Yeah, okay. I'll see you at home.
Typically when we're
looking at blackouts,
or loss of time,
I try to rule out
certain things first.
Okay.
- Addiction...
- Right.
- Dependency.
- Right.
Now, while I feel,
from time to time,
substances may be...
a factor for you,
I don't see any signs of abuse,
so I don't think you're an addict.
That's good. I'm not.
But even recreational use can
lead to lapses in judgment.
Watching pornography at work
would certainly fall
into that category,
wouldn't you say?
Yeah. Who did that?
You did that, Ben.
At the computer,
in the middle of the bullpen?
And the fact you don't remember
is a cause for concern.
I-I don't- I don't remember...
You remember leaving
with a hooker that night?
Do you remember her name?
Naomi?
Naomi. You left with her,
And it looked like you...
knew her intimately.
Is she the reason why Ella left?
I don't like where
you're going with this.
Where am I going, Ben?
I don't know where I'm going
because you're not
telling me anything.
Well, because it's
none of your business.
I'm here to talk about me,
I'm not here to talk about Ella.
But Ella's a big part
of your life, Ben,
And we have to look at it.
That's why I brought it up...
I'm not going to talk about it.
You were right when you said
Go back for them
You were right all along
Hear me
You were wrong to think
they wouldn't sell you out
You were wrong all
along can't you see...
