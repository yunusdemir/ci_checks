<i>Hey, it's me.</i>
<i>Pick up.</i>
<i>Pick up.</i>
- Hi.
- Hi.
Come in.
- Drink?
- No, thank you.
Perfect.
This way.
Slowly.
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>
<i>Pick up.</i>
<i>Pick up.</i>
<i>Brandon?</i>
<i>Brandon?</i>
<i>Brandon, where are you?</i>
<i>Brandon?</i>
<i>Brandon?</i>
<i>Brandon?</i>
<i>This is me, calling you.</i>
<i>Fuck!</i>
I find you disgusting.
I find you inconsolable.
I find you invasive.
This is what the cynics used to say.
Companies would refuse
to look into the future.
They would say,
'can we stop this virus? '
As if it was
a negative progression.
But it's growing.
More and more, with a momentum
that is unstoppable.
Now some kid snorts the entire load
of his mother's spice cupboard.
Post that on YouTube.
They would watch as it
becomes the buzz word
amongst high school
students everywhere.
Eventually, the cynicism
is turning into awe.
Do you know what's going on
with my computer?
They took it.
Yeah, I know.
Someone could have told me.
Some kind of virus.
Thanks.
<i>Cool.</i>
<i>OK, me again.</i>
<i>I'm dying. I have cancer.</i>
<i>I have one week to live.</i>
<i>It's the very worst kind of cancer.</i>
<i>Of the vulva...</i>
- Hey.
- Hey
- You're such a dick.
- What are you doing, man?
Alright, gentlemen. If you just...
please make yourselves at home.
<i>It falls upon me as your beloved boss</i>
<i>to propose a toast.</i>
<i>To success.</i>
I hope my wife appreciates it.
Get a new tie, please.
- Jesus Christ.
- Oh, my goodness.
I love women in suits.
We could talk business,
I would rearrange my life...
- She's beautiful.
- Grey suit?
I'm gonna go talk to her.
Count me down.
Yeah, you should.
- 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
- Boom.
Have fun.
Twenty bucks
says he fucks it up.
- Incoming.
- Hi, excuse me.
Listen, I don't want to beat around the
bush. I think you're absolutely gorgeous.
- My name's David.
- Hi, David. Elizabeth.
- Nice to meet you.
- It's a beautiful name.
- Hi, I'm David. I don't mean to be rude.
- Loren.
- Rachel.
- Nice to meet you.
Can I buy you a drink?
Can I buy you all drinks?
Sure. Why not?
I would love that.
That would be my pleasure.
- What are you guys drinking?
- We were thinking shots.
We just did shots of tequila.
Would you guys like a shot of tequila?
- Bring it on.
- Love it.
Bar tender? Can we get four
shots of your finest tequila?
Thank you very much.
I can see you're very successful.
I think part of the secretto my
success is attention to detail...
- Detail?
- Play the game.
- OK. Blue or green?
- I like games. I like this game.
Blue... green.
Green, it's green.
That's brown.
I don't know how you change
the colour of your eyes like that.
That's amazing.
That's a real talent.
- Detail man.
- Hey, buddy.
This guy, right here,
fucking nailed it today.
I want you to know you
fucking nailed it. You're the man.
Your pitch... amazing.
Listen, we're playing a game here.
Close your eyes again.
Blue or green?
- Brown.
- Fuck off.
Alright.
Loren, close your eyes.
- Blue.
- Blue. This is good.
He's just picking
colours randomly.
- You can have this shot.
- We need another shot, please.
- You can put these on me.
- No, I told you, I had it.
No, I have it.
- I'll get the next round.
- Sure.
You're a strong,
independent woman. I like that.
- Cheers.
- To nailing it.
To nailing it.
Oh, fuck.
- So what do you girls do for fun?
- Fun? Karate.
You hear this song?
I love this song, I wrote this song...
and I would love it if you
would dance with me
to this song that I wrote for you.
Come on. Let's go on
the dance floor. One song.
Yeah, come on.
You're a fun girl.
I'll bring her back.
Swear to God.
Come on, come on, it's fun.
I'm grabbing her purse 'cos she's
gonna get robbed and roofied.
- Dance?
- No.
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.
Okay.
Hold on. I just gotta
talk to you one more time.
Your eyes, they're beautiful. You know
why I didn't get it right the first time?
Because it's like a collage.
Let me see...
Look at those eyes.
David! Come on...
It's OK,
'cos I'm going this way.
Hey, man,
he's going up town
Come on.
- OK.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
Hey.
- Wanna ride.
- Sure.
I'll fucking kill you!
What the fuck?
- Fuck!
- Jesus Christ, Sissy!
Don't you fucking knock?
What the fuck?
Why would I knock, I live here?
- How'd you get in?
- You gave me fucking keys.
You fucking scared me.
Don't I always say call me first
if you're coming into town?
I called you so many times.
- You have a fucking baseball bat?
- Yeah.
What is this shit you put in your hair?
Honestly, it's awful.
- Shampoo.
- Is it for grooming dogs?
Good to see you.
- Lock the door next time.
- Yeah.
- Don't use all the towels.
<i>I want you.</i>
<i>I don't want anyone else.</i>
<i>There is no one else.</i>
<i>I love you. I'll do anything.</i>
<i>I'll do anything.</i>
<i>Please don't say that.</i>
<i>Please don't say that.</i>
<i>I love you. I love you.</i>
<i>I'll do anything. I'll do anything.</i>
I don't have to go out.
I don't even fucking want to go out.
I can stay with you.
I don't care. I don't care.
I don't need anybody else.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you so much.
I love you, please.
I love you. I love you.
<i>Please.</i>
<i>I feel sick.</i>
<i>I feel really sick.</i>
Morning.
Nice earring.
Hot date?
Juice?
Will you use a glass?
Sorry.
You're going grey.
Do you think I look fat?
- Do you think I look fat?
- Sit down.
Fuck you!
I'm doing a couple of gigs.
Yeah. Sure.
Can I stay?
- You want toast?
- Just for a few days.
I'd stay with Mark,
but he's being a fucking asshole.
- Mark?
- Please.
Jesus, Sissy.
What do you expect?
Pretty please?
Look, you get the sofa
and you get your ass off it
- before I leave every morning.
- I will. I promise. I will.
OK. OK. OK.
- We leave in fifteen.
- OK!
So good!
Stop fucking around.
- Leave it.
- You have fluff.
I like it there.
- How are you for money?
- I'm good.
- 'Cos if you need some money...
- Honestly,
I even make money now
and everything.
- Yeah, sure.
- Huge amounts.
Are you collecting mad hats?
You should come and hear me.
- Yeah, I will.
- 'Yeah, I will. '
Like, 'Yeah,
I will,' like last time?
Please come.
- Where'd you get this, anyway?
- It's vintage.
Yeah, I can see that.
- Do you like?
- Yeah.
Please come.
OK, I will.
Yay.
Sorry.
Fuck, my computer.
- Well, well, well.
- Morning, asshole.
Look who's decided
to grace us with his presence.
Don't tell me. No cabs.
No, your wife wouldn't
let me leave this morning.
Hey.
That's not cool.
You should be so lucky.
- Any calls?
- Yes. Like, fifty.
Hey! Heads up, buddy.
So, how'd it go last night?
Got home.
Right, right.
Let's do it again tonight.
Some place classier, though.
My sister
is playing downtown somewhere.
She's playing?
She's a musician.
Well, she's a singer.
OK. Yeah, yeah. You know what,
that sounds a lot of fun.
And that will ruin your enamel.
That elevator music's
like a bad acid trip.
- Good evening.
- Evening.
Reservation. Sullivan?
Great. I have you on the list.
I'll have you follow me?
Thank you.
- There you are.
- Right this way, please.
Wow, look at that ass.
I could follow that forever.
Nice pick.
Oh, I forget
how beautiful the city is.
- There we go.
- Thank you.
Hi, guys. How are you both
doing tonight? What can I get you?
Your accent. Are you?
Are you from?
Brazil.
- Rio?
- SÃ¢o Paulo.
That is a beautiful city.
That's...
- You've been there?
- Once or twice.
Can we get two
dry martinis with olives.
And a little bit later, why don't you
come by for a drink with us?
- I'll make sure I get those drinks.
- Thank you.
She would be
so offended if I didn't try.
Unbelievable.
<i>Start spreading</i>

Wow. Wow!
Bravo!
She's good!
She's good!
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I'm David.
- Sissy.
It is a pleasure to meet you.
I think you are absolutely fantastic
and you look great in the dress, too.
Please, sit down.
What did you think?
Yeah,
it was... interesting.
What do you mean?
No, it was...
it was good. It was good.
It was good?
He was crying.
There was tears coming down his face.
I saw it.
You made a grown-man cry.
- Really?
- I'm gonna get some drinks.
That's a great idea. (Why don't you)
Get a round for the table, buddy?
OK.
I'm really sorry about that, I...
He's had a rough day at work. I think
he's a little bit emotional, right now.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- So, you guys grew up in Jersey?
- Yeah.
- You still live there?
- God, no.
That's good.
Where do you live now?
- Kind of all over the place.
- Yeah?
- What's the last city you've been to?
- L. A.
Los Angeles?
- Oh, boy. You like it there?
- I'm going back.
- That must mean you love it then?
- No! I can't even fucking drive.
- You can't drive?
- No.
Why not?
I tried when I was a kid
and I was horrible.
How old were you when
you quit driving?
- Sixteen.
- You were sixteen years old?
So, wait a minute. How do you
get along in Los Angeles?
- I take the bus.
- No...
Look, a girl like you
cannot be taking the bus.
What happened
to your arm here?
When I was a kid I was bored.
- You must have been really bored?
- I was.
Alright,
we've got a problem.
Your sister cannot
be taking the bus anywhere.
I know a guy who owns a car rental
company. We're gonna get you a car.
We're going to drive around
in circles in a parking lot
and you are going
to learn how to drive.
Not stick, automatic.
It's a little easier.
I would love that.
You'd love that. That's good.
You know what? Better yet...
we're going to get you a golf cart and
you will drive the golf cart around.
Wow, now we're talking.
Everybody should drive golf carts.
A golf cart right up
Fifth Avenue, huh?
You know, they should.
It would be
a lot cleaner and greener.
It would be great for the city.
Brandon, what do you think?
- Sounds great.
- Yes...
I love your brother.
What an amazing man.
- How long are you here for?
- I don't know.
You don't know?
Can I see you again?
Please?
Is that too forward?
I just... I find you fascinating.
I really do. I think you're a fascinating
creature, I'd love to see you again.
Listen, why don't we... this is
a celebration, let's get champagne.
- Yes! Champagne!
- Champagne for the whole table!
Champagne.
I've got it, I've got it.
Get out, get out.
- Oh, God! No!
- Come on, come on with me...
- Get off. Get off. Get off me.
- Ah, come on, come on, come on...
- <i>Well, I am hot, I am hot.</i>
- <i>You are hot.</i>
<i>You are high...</i>
<i>No...</i>
- <i>You're cursing me.</i>
- <i>I don't know.</i>
<i>I need to take this off. I'm hot.</i>
<i>I need to take it off. I'm hot.</i>
- <i>Nice sheets.</i>
- <i>Aren't they nice sheets?</i>
<i>Bed, bath and beyond.</i>
I have to be up
and out by seven.
It's cold.
Sissy, get out of my room.
Sissy, get out of my room.
Get the fuck out!
Get out!
Hey, slacker.
Your computer's back.
Dave's looking for you.
- Yeah. It was really great last night.
- <i>Daddy, Daddy.</i>
Listen, I gotta go.
Thanks for calling.
Hey, buddy.
Listen, we said an hour French
and then Isobel's gonna pick you up
because Mommy's picking up Nathan.
Alright?
You can go after.
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>
<i>But Mommy says I can't.</i>
Well,
let's go talk to Mommy.
- <i>She's all the way downstairs.</i>
- Well, go downstairs and tell her
that Daddy said
it's OK for you to go to Jason's.
Come on.
How about that? Do it.
- You can do it. Get up.
- <i>OK.</i>
<i>Mommy?</i>
<i>Mommy?</i>
What's up, man?
- Steven said you wanted to see me.
- Yes...
Dude, 9 o'clock this morning,
where were you?
- Dentist. Root canal.
- Oh, shit.
Now, what did I tell you about that?
Who d'you see?
Gary Sher, King's practice,
West 57th Street.
Good. You're stinging the company
health plan, I hope, right?
- Sure.
- That's what it's there for, man.
Alright, brother.
Listen, one more thing.
Your hard drive is filthy, all right.
We got your computer back.
I mean, it is... dirty.
I'm talking like hoes, sluts,
anal, double anal,
penetration,
inter racial facial, man.
Cream pie...
I don't even know what that is.
- You think It was your intern?
- On my hard drive?
Yeah, someone's fucking
with your account, man.
And we're blowing our wad
in cash, you know?
It takes a really, really sick fuck
to spend all day on that shit.
- <i>Daddy, Daddy.</i>
- Yeah. Hey buddy.
What she say?
<i>She said I can go</i>
<i>to Jason's for a half hour</i>
<i>but I have to be home</i>
<i>by five for dinner.</i>
OK.
That's great. See?
Best of both worlds.
You got everything you want.
- You happy?
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- You better be. Get out of here.
- <i>OK. Alright, see you.</i>
Hey.
You like your sugar?
I do.
Hi.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Did you find it, OK?
- Yes,
I'm glad you made it.
Oh, yeah.
I'm late.
Sorry.
- You look handsome.
- You look amazing.
Hi.
How are you doing tonight?
- Thank you.
- OK.
I have a few specials on the menu,
if you'd like to hear them?
Sure.
The soup of the day is tomato
with basil oil and parmesan crostini.
The special is marinated sword fish,
tabouleh and Moroccan charmoula.
It's really good.
We're also serving a DeBragga and Spitler
New York Strip with a side order of fries
and the salad is snow pea
and radish with a cider vinaigrette.
Can I start you off
with a sparkling water?
Tap water's fine.
And the wine menu
is right next to you.
- You want some wine?
- Sure.
White, red?
Red. Maybe...
Pinot Noir is light...
if you like it like...
light.
Great.
OK.
I'll be back.
So.
- Where do You live?
- Brooklyn.
- Nice.
- Born and raised.
Where you from?
I was born in Ireland and we
moved here when I was a teen.
- Do you get back much?
- A couple of times.
A big family?
You miss them?
I have a sister.
- I have two.
- Oh, yeah?
- Older, younger?
- Older and younger.
I'm in the middle.
- What?
- Just wondering.
Are you nervous?
- Why would I be nervous?
- You look a little nervous.
Do I?
- No.
- Well, what's a date?
It's no big deal.
It took me an hour
to figure out what to wear.
You chose wisely.
I'm sorry, but I forgot to say
the crab comes in the shell.
Great.
Oh. Yeah...
I haven't even looked at this.
- I'll have the lamb.
- The lamb.
I'll have the lamb, too.
That sounds great.
No appetiser?
- I'm fine.
- No.
- And how would you like the lamb?
- Medium.
We recommend it pretty pink.
- OK.
- Yeah?
Pink it is.
Thank you. Excuse me.
So, you seeing
anyone at the moment?
No, I'm not.
Are you seeing anyone?
- No.
- No. Really?
Why is that?
I don't know.
It's just the way it is.
It's just the way it is.
Yeah, I...
actually... I'm...
I'm separated.
- Right.
- Yeah. Kind of a recent thing.
OK.
You were married for long?
- No.
- Did we decide on the wine?
Well, yeah...
was it the Pinot Noir, you said?
Yeah, great.
Great choice.
I wasn't married long. Gave it
a shot. It didn't really work out.
- Wow.
- What?
- Well, you just seem, like...
- What?
- Averse to the whole idea.
- Well, yeah.
I just don't understand why
people would want to get married.
Especially nowadays,
I mean, it's... you know?
I don't see the point.
- In relationships?
- It doesn't seem realistic.
- Are You serious? I mean?
- Yeah, I am, really.
Well, then, you know, why are we here,
if we don't matter to one another?
- Well...
- Why are you here?
The food is supposed
to be great here.
No, no, no, no.
I'm not saying it like that.
I mean,
I just mean, you know?
One person for the rest of your life?
I mean, it's...
I mean, you come to restaurants,
you see couples sitting together and...
they don't even speak to one another.
They don't have anything to say?
They probably don't have to speak
because they're connected.
Or they're just bored
with one another.
- Every...
- Here we go.
What's your
longest relationship?
Exactly.
- That's... you can pour.
- Sure.
Four months.
You have to commit.
You have to actually give it a shot.
- I did... for four months.
- For four months.
Thank you.
Look, touch that.
Your head?
- Oh, no, no, no...
- You're such a... weirdo.
No, seriously, seriously, seriously.
Touch it.
OK.
- Oh, my God.
- Do you feel that?
- Yeah, what is it?
- It's a remnant.
- A remnant?
- Yeah, from the Neanderthals.
There's only a few of us left
since the Homo sapiens took over.
That would explain the forehead.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- 'What's that supposed to mean? '
What do you mean?
Seriously, how d'you get it?
What is it?
I used to play this game
where I'd sit on his feet
and he'd fly me through the air.
I hit my head off the ceiling
and I blacked out.
I was knocked out
for five or ten minutes.
I peed my pants.
If you had a choice
to live in the past or the future
and you could be anything
you wanted to be, what would you be?
What would you be?
Well, I always wanted to be
a musician in the sixties.
- That's cool. A musician?
- Yeah.
Sixties is tough, though.
I saw 'Gimme Shelter' recently,
you know,
- the Rolling Stones documentary?
- Yeah.
It kind of seemed like hell.
What?
The sixties would be like
the last place I'd want to be.
- No way!
- Yes.
Chaos!
So, where would you wanna,
and what would you wanna be?
You know, here, now.
- That's boring.
- Fuck you.
OK. Well, this is me.
- This is you.
- This is me.
Thank you very much, Brandon.
Thank you very much, Marianne.
We should do this again.
Right.
So, is that a yes?
<i>Maybe, yeah.</i>
Hello? Sissy?
Oh! Fuck!
Fuck!
Fuck!
- Are you fucking spying on me?
- Lock the fucking door.
- Are you fucking spying?
- Are you fucking spying?
- What do you want?
- You wanna fight?
You wanna fight? You wanna fight?
You wanna fight?
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
- What do you want?
- Get off me!
- Why did you come here? Why?
- Get off me!
- Why?
- Get off me!
- You're fucking hurting me.
- Talk to me! You fucking bitch!
- Get the fuck off, you fucking weirdo.
- Fucking slut!
Fuck you!
Brandon?
<i>Brandon, I'm sorry.</i>
<i>Hey, where's Brandon?</i>
<i>Are you Brandon's girlfriend?</i>
<i>Do you wanna play?</i>
<i>Do you wanna play with my tits?</i>
<i>I know Brandon would really like it</i>
<i>and I know exactly</i>
<i>what Brandon likes.</i>
Come on.
Where are you taking me?
Come on. You'll see.
- No, where are we going?
- Come on.
You wanna drink?
What are you looking at?
This view is amazing.
Are they vintage?
A little bit.
I love it.
Brandon?
You know, it's cool.
It's OK.
- Should I go?
- Sure.
I can walk you down.
That's OK.
Can I get you a drink?
No.
Fuck.
Need a hand?
No.
The hook's odd.
There you go.
<i>David?</i>
<i>Pick up.</i>
<i>I take it you're</i>
<i>at your pottery class.</i>
Have you eaten?
No.
- Are you hungry?
- No.
Can you just give me a hug?
He's not gonna screw
you again.
You left a message,
didn't you?
You can't help yourself.
It's disgusting.
Why are you so fucking angry?
Why am I so fucking angry?
That's my boss.
You sleep with him after 20 minutes.
Now you're calling him up.
What's the matter with you?
You know he's got a family, right?
- You know he's got a family?
- No.
You didn't see
the wedding ring on his finger?
No.
You're a liar.
I'm sorry.
You're always sorry.
That's all you ever fucking say.
Well,
at least I say I'm sorry.
Try doing something.
Actions count, not words.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I fucked up.
I'm not perfect.
I make mistakes, but I'm trying.
Some people
fuck up all the time.
Look, just forget it.
This isn't working out.
Obviously.
You need to find
somewhere else to live.
I don't have anywhere else
to go.
This isn't about him.
I make you angry all the time
and I don't know why.
No.
You trap me.
You force me into a corner
and you trap me.
'I've got nowhere else to go.'
I mean,
what sort of fucking shit is that?
You're my brother.
- So what? I'm responsible for you?
- Yes.
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you fucking are.
I didn't give birth to you.
I didn't bring you into this world.
You're my brother,
I'm your sister. We're family.
- We're meant to look after each other.
- You're not looking after me.
- I'm looking after myself.
- I'm trying. I'm trying to help you.
How are you helping me?
How are you helping me?
How are you helping me?
Look at me.
How are you helping me?
You come in here
and you're a weight on me.
Do you understand me?
You're a burden.
You're just fucking
dragging me down.
How are you helping me?
You can't even clean up
after yourself.
Stop playing the victim.
I'm not playing
the fucking victim.
If I left,
I would never hear from you again.
Don't you think that's sad?
Don't you think that's sad?
You're my brother.
Why is it always
so dramatic with you?
Everything
is always the end of the world.
It's not fucking dramatic.
I'm trying to talk to you.
I don't wanna talk.
Try not talking.
Try just listening
or thinking for a change.
'Cos that's working great for you.
You're completely fine.
- I've got my own fucking apartment.
- Oh, whoopee-fucking shit.
You have your own apartment,
that's amazing.
Your job and an apartment,
I should be in awe of you.
Well,
at least I'm responsible for it.
At least I don't
depend on people all the time.
You're a dependency.
You're a parasite.
You don't have anybody. You have me
and your fucking pervert boss.
You slept with that fucking pervert boss.
What does that make you?
Don't talk to me about sex-life, Brandon.
Not from you.
Whatever.
I'm going out.
Great.
And then you'll come back
and we'll just have the
same fucking conversation again.
No, you'll move out.
And then I'll never
hear from you again?
Hey.
Hey.
You wanna get out of here?
I could take you somewhere.
What, are you with someone?
Does he go down on you?
I do.
That's what I like to do.
<i>I like the way it feels.</i>
<i>I like the way it's just me and it.</i>
I wanna taste you.
I wanna slip
my tongue inside you...
just as you come.
You want me
to make you come?
I can do that.
Want me to do that?
What's up, babe?
- I was just getting some drinks.
- Yeah, huh?
Not tonight, buddy.
I said not tonight.
I was just telling
your pretty girlfriend here,
I'd like to fuck her
in that tight pussy of hers.
I mean bone her real hard.
- Till she's clawing up my back.
- He's kidding.
This guy's funny.
After I fuck her hard up the ass,
I put my balls in her mouth
while I come on her face.
- You won't let me fuck you in the ass?
- Christ.
- You get to fuck her in the ass?
- You know.
Tell me more, man,
because I'm fucking loving this.
Smell it.
- Jesus, come on.
- You Motherfucker.
Hey, Romeo.
<i>Brandon, it's Sissy.</i>
<i>I really need to talk to you.</i>
<i>Please will you pick up</i>
<i>the fucking phone?</i>
<i>Brandon, I need you.</i>
<i>We're not bad people.</i>
<i>We just come from</i>
<i>a bad place.</i>
<i>Thanks for letting me stay.</i>
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>at this time,</i>
<i>due to a police investigation,</i>
<i>we have to discharge this train.</i>
<i>Please follow the conductor</i>
<i>to the rear of the train.</i>
<i>Watch your step between cars.</i>
Watch your step.
Follow me, please.
Follow me.
Watch your step.
This way.
This way. Quickly.
This way.
Nothing to see. Move on.
<i>This is Sissy.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>
<i>Don't if you're an asshole.</i>
- <i>This is Sissy...</i>
- Shit!
Shithead.
