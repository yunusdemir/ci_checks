Peter was a courageous boy,
but that dawn, he could feel fear
stick to his skin like dew on leaves.
The fog was thick enough
to make him lose his way home.
Then he began to hear strange noises
coming from the depths of the forest.
He noticed a presence.
Small shadows that seemed to giggle
as they followed in his footsteps.
Who were they, Grandpa?
Cruel, deformed forest dwellers,
haughty creatures,
spiteful and impudent.
They are the vengeful
and evil goblins.
The little people of the night.
What did they want with him?
What did Peter do to the goblins?
That's the point.
Goblins don't need to justify
their cruel acts.
They're evil creatures.
But let me go on, please.
Okay. I won't
interrupt you anymore.
To make a long story short,
Peter started to
run and run and run.
Poor Peter remained on the ground,
unconscious for a long time.
Finally, when he
opened his eyes,
he saw her in front of him,
just a few inches away from him.
A goblin?
She was a lovely girl with
huge eyes the color of the sea.
She looked at him kindly,
her expression full of love.
Peter immediately
fell in love with her.
She caressed him, and offered him
something to eat and drink.
The strange concoction
she offered him was delicious.
Peter ate and drank without
ever taking his eyes off her.
He was bewitched by that gaze,
and it was that look
that deceived him.
I bet it was
a goblin in disguise.
Those evil creatures
can transform themselves,
into flesh-and-blood people
whenever and however they want.
You're making a mistake, Grandpa.
You said, "They can."
You should have said,
"They could,"
or what kind of
fairy tale is it?
They can. They can.
Goblins still exist.
Your Grandpa Seth
is telling you.
And, how did Peter end up?
He began to
feel ill, very ill.
He was sweating
chlorophyll green.
Green?
That's right. The color
of the goblins. The color of sap.
Then she appeared to him
as she really was.
Horrible and mocking.
Changed into what?
Half man, half plant,
the goblin's favorite food.
Food? Don't tell me
they ate him, Grandpa.
That's exactly what happened.
With a voracity that has no equal on Earth.
What are you doing
still up, Josh?
Grandpa Seth was
telling me a...
Still telling
the same story, Josh?
I know, Mommy. I told you
it would never happen again.
But you see,
it's not a dream for me.
I see him in front of me,
and he's so real.
And he tells me stories
from just like before.
Grandpa Seth has been gone
for more than six months now.
You were at the funeral, and I know
it was very difficult for you.
It was also very difficult
for your father
and for Holly,
and for me, his daughter.
He was an amazing man.
Grandpa Seth has remained
in all our hearts.
But you must banish him
from your mind.
Remember what
the doctor said?
Of course.
Grandpa Seth is just
an invention of
my subconscious.
That's right.
But he's so real that...
That's enough.
Try to go to sleep.
We're going on
a vacation tomorrow.
A month in the country
will do us all good.
Good night, dear.
Mom?
Yes?
Do goblins exist?
No, dear,
they don't exist.
Now, try to go to sleep.
Yeah, John, that's "Nilbog," right.
Spell it? Yeah. N-I-L-B-O-G.
Yeah. We'll be gone
around a month. That's right.
Yeah, can you take care of that
business for me while we're gone?
Yeah.
That's great. Okay. See you, John.
All right. Bye.
Are the kids sleeping?
No. They're more awake than we are.
They're probably
excited about the trip.
Do you know how many people
live in Nilbog?
No. How many?
Twenty-six, including the Presents.
Isn't that wonderful?
Come on to bed.
Just think, we'll be living
like our ancestors did.
Yeah, we'll be peasants
and farmers
just like people
did a century ago.
Hey. What's the matter?
I'm worried about Joshua.
He's still seeing
Grandpa Seth.
When I was a kid, I had
an imaginary playmate, too.
But it wasn't your
dead grandfather.
It'll end.
This trip will make him
forget about your father.
Michael?
Yeah?
Who are the goblins?
The goblins?
You fell! What a jerk!
He pointed
the light right at me.
Goblins don't exist.
Goblins don't exist.
Elliott. What kind of
idiotic joke is this?
You scared the shit out of me!
I'm the victim of
a nocturnal rapture.
I have to release my lowest
instincts with a woman.
Release your instincts
in the bathroom.
Are you nuts?
Are you trying to
turn me into a homo?
Wouldn't be too hard.
If my father
discovers you here,
he'd cut off your
little nuts and eat them.
He can't stand you.
And you?
I like you.
But my family doesn't like you.
They say you're good for nothing
and that you spend way too much
time with your friends.
But I swear, I never see them.
Elliott, how long is
this going to take?
We're sick of waiting for you.
Don't you want to come
to Tonino's with us, Holly?
Don't you want some pizza?
You know, these are cute.
These are cute.
Do you see?
What's wrong with having friends?
Nothing, if you want
to remain a virgin for life.
You take them to
bed with you, too,
and I don't believe in group sex.
Is it true that your family's
going on vacation tomorrow?
Yes.
I'll come with you.
Okay. I'll tell my father
that you're coming with us tomorrow.
Where are we going?
Nilbog, a wonderful,
half-empty town. It's an exchange.
A family from the country
is coming to live here,
and we're going to
live in their house.
Oh, Elliott,
it will be wonderful.
You and me in the woods.
This time, we'll be able
to be together for sure.
And my boys?
If you bring them with you,
I never want to see you again.
Okay, I'm going now,
and I'll tell them.
I'll see you tomorrow morning?
At 8:00, on the dot.
Okay.
Elliott.
Yeah?
Alone?
Of course. I'll see
you tomorrow morning.
Finally.
Please don't do this, Holly.
We could have waited another 15 minutes.
I'm sure he would have come.
We left at 9:30,
an hour and a half off schedule,
and we never saw a sign of your beau.
Elliott's not my beau.
He's my boyfriend.
And he told me last night
that he loves me,
and that he wanted to come
on this trip with me and my family.
Evidently, he preferred
his friends to you.
That's not true!
Yes, it is!
You should listen to reason.
Elliott is
a good-for-nothing!
Now stop it, both of you!
I have no intention of having
my vacation ruined just for this.
I never liked that kid.
I never did.
I'm the one who has to
like him, Dad, me alone.
Stop it, please!
Joshua, start singing. Come on,
sing that song I like so much.
I don't feel like singing, Mom.
Just sing.
Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the stream
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
Life is but a dream
Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the stream
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
Life is but a dream
Where in the hell is Nilbog?
It's not even marked on the map.
It's got to be there somewhere.
Just look closer, dudes.
Here it is,
but it's just a speck.
Are you sure it's full of
beautiful girls, Elliott?
Lots of them,
free and unattached.
Yeah!
Yeah!
I don't feel good.
Stop the car, Dad!
I'm sick!
You stuffed yourself
like a pig, Joshua.
I would love to see you get sick.
You ate too much.
Dad, stop the car.
Joshua's ready to be eaten.
Don't eat me!
Joshua!
Was I dreaming?
Who wanted to eat you,
little brother?
Nobody.
We're only a few
miles away, Josh.
Speaking of eating,
do you want some, Joshua?
No, thanks.
Stop the car, Daddy. Stop!
What's wrong?
Do you have to throw up?
Yes, I have to throw up.
What are you
doing here, Grandpa?
What are all of
you doing here?
You have to
make them go back.
Why?
You're getting yourselves
into big trouble.
This is a bad place, little one.
It even gives me the creeps.
Can't you tell
me more, Grandpa?
What are you
doing, Joshua?
So how about it, are you
going to give me a ride or not?
Get in the car, Joshua.
Come on, hurry.
Come on, get in. Jeez.
Come on! Holly! What?
Well, that was them, right?
Yeah, right. She just...
Why didn't Holly stop them?
I don't think it was such a good
idea to come up here, guys.
Just shut up. I'm the one
in charge, not her.
Says you.
There's no one here.
It's normal.
This is a farming community.
Remember, at this time of night,
everybody goes to sleep.
Where's the farm?
It's over there.
Now, remember, we're the farmer Waits.
We're country people.
Dad!
What, Josh?
I don't like this place.
Can we go home?
What?
Don't listen to him.
Lead the way, Farmer Waits.
Okay.
Fresh air. Country air.
Hello.
You're late.
I'm sorry,
we had a small mishap.
Here are the keys.
Here are ours.
Enjoy your stay in Nilbog.
Enjoy our city, too.
You'll enjoy
our city.
It has some smog and
it's a little noisy,
but our house has
all the major conveniences.
It's got a microwave and video,
all the other appliances.
Yeah.
A refrigerator, a bar.
Boy, they're people
of few words.
Come on, let's go in.
Joshua, you coming?
Not bad.
Not bad.
I'm hungry.
They probably left something behind,
I'd be willing to bet.
Come take a look, everyone.
Typical country hospitality.
Let's dig in.
Here, have some of this.
That country hospitality!
Yes.
Here, try this. It looks good.
Some of this.
Yeah, what is it?
Grandpa.
Don't let them eat, Joshua.
For the love of God, don't let them eat.
Aren't you hungry, Joshua?
Here, have some of this.
There's green stuff
on the corn. How weird.
Stop them, Joshua.
You're the only one that can do it.
If they eat, they'll come to
the same end as Peter in the story.
But how can I stop them?
Okay.
You have 30 seconds to come up
with some way to stop them.
I must do it.
I must do it.
I must do it!
No, Daddy, please!
Don't hit him, Michael!
Please don't hit him!
Why not?
It's what he deserves.
A big spanking
for a little shit.
Joshua is not a little shit.
He's just very sensitive.
This smells.
Do you see this writing?
Do you know what it means?
Hospitality.
And you can't piss on hospitality!
I won't allow it!
What're you going
to do to me, Daddy?
Tightening my belt by one loop,
so I don't feel hunger pains.
And your sister and mother
will have to do likewise.
Okay, Joshua.
You want to get
rough with me,
you want to show me
that you don't like
the choice of this house for our
vacation by going on a hunger strike?
Well, I'll accept
the challenge, but just remember,
when I was your age,
I really did suffer from hunger.
We'll see who
gets through this,
but just remember,
I've got more practice than you.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I'm sick of this.
Where are all the single,
unattached, horny girls, Elliott?
Don't be a pain
in the neck, Arnold.
We just got here.
Come on.
I'm going outside for
a breath of fresh air.
Hey, Arnold, if you find
any twins, don't be greedy.
Hey! Hey!
Hey!
Ma'am? Please stop.
Stop, I say.
Hey, stop!
Excuse me, ma'am!
Ma'am! Stop!
Stop, stop, I say!
Who are you?
Are you one
of the monsters?
I've been called a lot of things,
but not a monster.
You're human?
Very human.
You want to see?
What's the matter?
Are you sick?
They made me eat that stuff.
I think I'm dying.
They, who?
Who are you talking about?
There they are!
What are they?
Monsters!
What do you want from me?
Wait here. Wait here.
I'll take care of them.
Let me give you
some advice, you dwarfs.
Get out of here, or you're going
to be in a lot of trouble.
And remember...
Hey, did you guys
hear that yell?
It was probably just Arnold
deflowering a Nilbog virgin.
No, no. That wasn't the scream
of a woman. That was Arnold.
Then it was probably a girl
from Nilbog deflowering Arnold.
Probably.
Let's get out of here! Quick!
Let's hide in this house.
What kind of a place is this?
This is my house.
Allow me
to introduce myself.
I am Creedence Leonore Gielgud,
of ancient druid origins.
My ancestors came
from Stonehenge.
Am I mistaken,
or is there something wrong
with the two of you?
We...
We need a doctor, ma'am.
Please call the nearest hospital.
There is no hospital in Nilbog.
We are used to curing ourselves.
Here we are.
This broth
is miraculous.
It contains sap from the forest.
It is a concentration of all of
the vegetal properties of the Earth.
Drink of it.
Children, my poor children.
What's wrong?
What's wrong with her?
Don't worry about her.
Drink your broth.
I can't move. Why?
You talk too much for me.
Oh, my God,
what's happening to her?
And why can't I move? There must be
a logical reason for all this.
Shut up!
She's changing!
She's purifying herself. Now she's
one with the vegetable world.
Now she's food for my children.
Oh!
Make yourselves comfortable.
Is it ready?
They're eating her!
And then they're
going to eat me!
Oh, my God!
I don't like this place,
not one bit.
Dear Elliott Cooper,
tomorrow morning
will be your final judgment.
Either me or your boys.
Take it or leave it.
The beautiful Holly Waits,
or your lovely little boys.
Make a choice, Elliott.
Joshua, Joshua...
Mom! Dad!
Mom! Mom!
What is it? What is it?
What's the matter?
What's wrong?
I saw him.
Who? Who did you see?
Grandpa Seth.
See? It wasn't me this time.
It was a reflection
in the mirror. It was him!
Grandpa Seth was
calling out to Joshua.
I'm tired of this.
Come with me, all of you.
So where is
that damn mirror?
It's right...
It's right there.
There's no one
other than us in there.
But he was there before.
It's got to be your imagination
or a hallucination.
Are you still
smoking dope, Holly?
I swore I wouldn't, Dad.
Look, I want to get up
early in the morning.
We're still
farmers now, right?
I'm not sleeping
in this room.
Come on, Holly. Didn't you hear
what your father said?
I'm not sleeping here.
I'll sleep here.
You would really
do that for me?
Sure.
Why not? I'm not afraid.
Good night, son.
Good night, Josh.
Thank you.
Good night, Josh.
Now go to sleep.
Grandpa! Grandpa Seth, are you here?
What happened?
You were in the wrong room!
Holly was sleeping there.
I still have to learn
the layout of this house.
Well, I'm glad to see you,
Grandpa. Did you see?
I managed to keep
them from eating.
And now, you have to convince
them to leave here.
This is an evil place.
It is the kingdom of the goblins.
But why don't you tell
my mommy and daddy these things?
They don't listen to me.
Your mother has never taken my advice.
That's why she married
that good-for-nothing.
The powers of evil
are very strong here.
I must leave.
But I'll be back, Joshua.
I'll be back.
Grandpa, only you
can do something. Only you.
Damn. There's no milk.
There's no coffee. There's nothing.
Guys, didn't anyone remember
to bring supplies?
We left in too
much of a hurry, Drew.
Go into town and
do the shopping now.
Yeah, with what?
I don't have any money.
Just take it out
of the group fund.
Okay.
Is breakfast
ready, dear?
Jeez, there's nothing in the whole
house. No eggs, no bacon.
There's just a lot of milk,
but it's all like this.
It must be a week old.
Good morning, Mom.
Good morning, Dad.
What's for breakfast?
Nothing.
What?
I'm hungry enough
to eat a horse.
I've been fasting
for two days.
No problem.
Josh and I will
run into town
to the general store,
right, Josh?
Okay.
We won't be gone long.
Hello, son.
Hi.
Are you in training?
Just going shopping.
Hop in, then. You'll save
your breath that way.
Okay. Thanks.
I'm Sheriff Gene Freak.
Nice to meet you, Sheriff.
Are you just
passing through Nilbog?
Well, I'm on vacation
with some friends.
We parked our
camper on the road.
Are you hungry?
A little bit, yeah.
Here, eat this.
Thank you, Sheriff.
Thanks, Sheriff.
This is good.
I'm sure you'll
all enjoy Nilbog.
We're hospitable people,
especially to strangers.
Well, here's
the general store.
Oh. And, Sheriff, where do the girls
from around here go at night?
The girls!
Can I help you?
Coffee.
There's no coffee here in Nilbog.
It's the devil's drink.
Eggs.
Bacon.
Are you crazy, boy?
We're vegetarians here in Nilbog.
Didn't you know that?
Here's some Nilbog milk.
Special milk,
high in vitamin content.
Here. It's free.
Free?
Of course it's free.
We love tourists here in Nilbog.
Try some, boy, and have some
of your friends drink some also.
Thank you.
Do you feel all right?
Yeah.
Hey, you.
Yeah?
Your friend has
a message for you.
Who? Arnold?
Yeah, that's him.
He said to meet him
in the house
that looks like an old church.
Okay.
You can go through the woods.
It's only about a mile away.
Good morning, my little flower.
Oh.
No need to worry
about the closed mouth.
You didn't have
anything to say, anyway.
Right?
With this, you will become
strong and beautiful.
Now, I am going to welcome
our new neighbors.
I have just
prepared this pudding
with wild nettles
and a few organic additives
to make it delicious
and purify the intestines.
See you later, my little flower.
We have to wait and be patient.
Grandpa. Grandpa Seth,
are you there?
Nilbog... It's "goblin"
spelled backwards!
This is their kingdom!
Good morning. I am your neighbor.
I am Creedence Leonore Gielgud.
Good morning.
Mom, I'm going for a walk.
Hello, beautiful.
Hi.
She is very appetizing.
Appetizing?
Provocative.
I thought you might enjoy
one of my ancient recipes.
It's a traditional
dish in these parts.
Oh, but you shouldn't have
gone to so much trouble.
No trouble.
Really.
The decaying
part of the body...
And repulsive!
They're still here.
Symbol of original sin,
which has consumed and caused
the fall of the human race,
which is so dear to us.
Flesh!
And by "flesh" I mean all
that stinking, disgusting meat.
Ugh!
Hamburgers!
Steaks! The stink of sausages!
And hot dogs sold by
the side of the road.
The stink of smoked carcasses.
Ugh!
Ugh!
The humans nourish
themselves with these,
violating their own bodies,
infecting themselves,
creating incurable ailments.
Smelly bladders!
Nests of infection!
Clusters of hemorrhoids!
Vicious, stinky excrement.
Vicious, stinky...
Elliot. Elliot!
Holly. What a surprise.
Choose, Elliott,
either me or your friends.
I don't understand.
Do you understand now?
Is it ready?
It is,
nice and creamy.
WOThis is a wonderful cup of Nilbog
ice cream for a little child.
You're going to stuff
yourself with it, aren't you?
Kids with a sweet tooth
like yours love ice cream.
Help, Grandpa Seth! Help!
Mmm!
Open your mouth, my little
friend. Please, open it.
I won't!
I don't want to!
Mmm!
Open your mouth, my little
friend. Please, open it.
Mmm!
No, I won't!
I don't want to!
No, I won't!
Stop!
What are you
doing to my son?
We were giving him
some ice cream.
Daddy, they're goblins,
monstrous beings!
What?
They were giving me ice cream
so that they could eat me later!
An active imagination.
A bit morbid, isn't he?
Look at them. They all have a mole
the shape of a clover leaf!
And Nilbog, it's "goblin"
spelled backwards!
I'm telling you, Daddy,
they're monsters.
Mr. and Mrs. Presents,
what are you doing here?
I thought you were
supposed to be at my house.
We had car trouble.
We'll be leaving this evening.
Okay.
It was nice meeting...
Meeting all of you.
My son and I
must be leaving now.
We need time for
some things to happen.
We must have
patience until tonight.
Christ!
What is it?
Your sister Holly's with that
playboy son of the Coopers.
But they're
my friends, all right?
Who do you think you are?
Just keep
your own friends.
Don't you ever...
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Stop it.
Oh, no.
So, kids, how's life?
Listen, Mr. Waits...
I don't want anything
to do with you.
I don't speak to people who arrive
late and upset their girlfriends.
You've given me a bad impression.
Come on, Dad.
We'll get in the car
and talk, Holly, okay?
Listen, Mr. Waits, we need
to have a serious talk.
If you want to
have a serious talk,
you'll have to forget about
your friends and come to our house.
Otherwise, you forget about Holly.
All right. I'm coming.
Hey, wait a minute, Elliott.
You're gonna
leave me here alone?
Yes.
Well, what do I tell Drew and Arnold?
Tell them whatever you want.
What am I going to do?
Take the camper.
Do what you want.
What about the beautiful,
liberated girls?
Is there anyone here?
I'm so dizzy.
Drew.
Over here.
Arnold?
Is that you?
Arnold, what's happened?
What?
Oh, my...
Get me out of here, Drew.
Just get me out of here.
Okay. Okay. Don't fret.
Hurry, before that
crazy lady gets back.
Grab the pot
and drag me out. Quick!
I'll try.
Hurry.
Come on. Come on. Hurry!
What's wrong?
Why did you stop?
I don't feel so good.
You've got to do it, man.
Grab hold of the pot and pull
with all of your strength.
We can get out of
this nightmare. Hurry!
Hello.
Oh, no.
You were thinking
of leaving us, little flower?
No. Please, ma'am.
You will be
punished for this!
No. Please, ma'am, I beg you.
What are you going to do?
What are you going
to do to me with that?
I'm going to make a nice
milkshake for your friend.
But this won't hurt you.
You'll just feel a little
tickle, little flower.
What's going on here?
Oh, Michael!
Look, what a surprise
they have prepared for us.
Finally!
I am so hungry.
What are you
doing here, Elliott?
Mom, Elliott's part
of the family now.
Oh, Elliott.
What a pleasure
to see you again, Mr. Waits.
We wanted to make up
for the misunderstanding
we had a little while ago.
Look! All the people of Nilbog
have decided to give you a party.
We even have a little food.
A little food?
They've prepared a whole feast!
Dance, my children.
Dance and eat!
Eat!
No! Don't eat this stuff!
They're monsters. They're all monsters!
If you eat this stuff,
they'll kill us! They're goblins!
Joshua, I've had enough.
I'm sick of this.
I want you to go
to your room immediately.
Children's fantasies.
They will pass.
Of course.
Grandpa. Grandpa Seth!
Grandpa.
Grandpa.
Grandpa Seth, answer me!
Grandpa. Grandpa Seth!
Come quick.
Grandpa Seth!
Help, Grandpa Seth! Help!
Grandpa!
We must move quickly
to put out the fire.
What fire?
Guess.
That is enough!
Go around the house.
When the time comes, you light
the wick and throw the bottle.
I'll create some
confusion with this.
Hurry. Let's put
some fuel on the fire.
Cut it out, kid! You'll never
be able to stop us!
And as for you, old man,
go back to your kingdom of shadows.
I order you, with the sacred
power of the magic stone
and its lord,
go back to hell!
Grandpa!
Grandpa!
Grandpa! Grandpa!
Joshua!
You'll have to
do it yourself!
Are you really in hell?
No!
But I know a trick that a friend
of mine who was there taught me!
What happened?
Grandpa!
Oh, my God!
What is this?
He was one of us, and you
killed him! Now it's your turn!
Joshua!
Quick! In the house!
O lord of the magic
rock of Stonehenge,
come and protect your children!
Come and give us strength!
Give me all my old power,
lord of the magic rock!
There's sandwiches
for tonight in here.
It will go easier
if you eat them.
You'll make our work easier.
Otherwise, we'll be
forced to kill you violently.
It would be a shame.
The blood would
mix with the meat,
and we'd have to put them
in vinegar for the whole night.
Oh, dear God!
What can we do?
We don't even have enough
weapons to defend ourselves.
Do something,
Elliott, please!
I don't know what to do.
We need Grandpa Seth here.
Joshua, Grandpa Seth is dead.
I know he's dead, but up till now,
he's been the one helping us.
But how do we get him to come?
By holding a sèance, maybe?
You're a genius, big sister.
Oh.
What the hell is
wrong with this thing?
Do you like it?
Shall we eat it together?
What kind of show is this?
I'm not a program.
I'm real.
Come out and you'll see.
Won't you invite me in?
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, of course.
Do you like it?
What's the matter?
Aren't you hungry?
Actually, I like popcorn.
Oh. Well, no problem.
All we have to do is heat it up.
Nothing's happening.
Raise your hands.
Concentrate harder!
Grandpa Seth, come to us.
Let's show them
we're still here!
Don't get distracted!
Concentrate harder.
Grandpa Seth, please come.
I don't like this. Why don't
they show any sign of life?
Grandpa, please come and help us.
Joshua... Joshua...
Dad!
That's not possible.
I knew you wouldn't
leave us, Grandpa.
That's the voice
of your grandpa?
Yes.
We have
only 10 minutes.
When that clock
starts striking 6:00,
I'll disappear...
And now it is forever.
Together, we can
destroy the magic stone
that gives the goblins
their power.
Concentrate, Joshua.
Concentrate!
Yes, Grandpa.
Joshua?
Joshua! Joshua!
Quick! Upstairs!
Michael!
Grandpa Seth, are you here?
Help!
Go away, monster!
Let's run!
Grandpa, where have you been?
Take this. Keep it.
You can only take out the contents
when you really need it.
Do you understand?
I understand.
And now?
There it is,
the Stonehenge magic stone.
The goblins' magic power.
What do we have to do?
Touch it. Only touch it.
Will it work?
I hope so.
Please, let's talk.
We're all humans here.
No more.
No more popcorn.
Our queen is calling us.
Joshua's alone right now!
Let's go.
Grandpa,
nothing's happening.
Something has
happened now, Joshua.
I'm leaving.
No, Grandpa. Not now.
Joshua, I have to do
this once again.
Remember,
it's only the power of goodness
that can defeat the goblins.
Goodbye forever.
Goodbye, Grandpa.
What were you going
to do, little one?
Get off!
Now,
we are going to feed you, Joshua.
You've been fasting two days.
You're hungry.
Right?
A double-decker
baloney sandwich!
Don't do it!
Think about the fats in your blood!
Think about the cholesterol!
Think about the toxins.
No! No!
Joshua.
Grandpa Seth's voice
brought us here.
Quick! Help me! Put your hands on
the stone and concentrate.
What? Don't you see?
Only the power of goodness
can destroy these monsters.
Put your hands on the stone!
Concentrate!
Concentrate more!
Concentrate!
I have to pass
by the office.
I need to go home
for a while.
I'll come with you.
Joshua and I will
wait for you at home.
Want some fruit, Joshua?
The fruit is still very good.
I don't want to eat
for the next 20 years.
Mmm.
It's delicious.
I think I'm going to
my room to take a nap.
Good idea. I think
I'll take a shower first.
I don't know how to thank you, Grandpa.
I hope you're okay up there.
Eat up.
Mom?
Mommy!
Mommy!
They're eating my mom.
Do you want some, Joshua?
