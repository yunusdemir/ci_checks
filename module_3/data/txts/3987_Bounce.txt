<i>Buddy: Hey, Jim, ready</i>
<i>for your Christmas present? </i>
<i>We're now the biggest little</i>
<i>ad agency on the west coast. </i>
<i>Jim: </i>
<i>We got it back? </i>
<i>Buddy: Yeah. I pitched, </i>
<i>they caught, we closed. </i>
<i>We got the Infinity Airlines</i>
<i>account for the next 2 years. </i>
They love us.
<i>Jim: </i>
<i>This is great, Buddy. </i>
I thought he was gonna
give me a corsage.
I thought he was gonna
kiss me right there.
<i>Jim: Did he sign? </i>
Yeah. I got the signed
contract in front of me.
I'm looking at it.
You want a quote?
He said, "I can't see
why we would ever leave."
<i>Jim: Buddy, this is great. </i>
<i>You did it! </i>
Yeah, no problem.
I'm on the 6:00 flight.
I think I'm flying free
for life.
<i>Jim: Hey, Buddy, you really</i>
<i>came through on this one. </i>
What can I tell you?
<i>Jim: That's some</i>
<i>Christmas present. </i>
No problem, man.
All right.
I'll see you in a bit.
Bye.
<i>Buddy: Is it supposed to</i>
<i>snow like this all night? </i>
<i>P. A: Thank you</i>
<i>for your patience</i>
<i>this snowy holiday season. </i>
<i>If you have not met... </i>
<i>Buddy: Shit. </i>
O'Hare is hell with runways
and a couple ofTCBY's.
L.A.?
Yeah. Does it show?
I think I flew out
with you on Tuesday.
Ron Wachter.
Yeah. Buddy Amaral.
Good to see you.
I don't know.
I've seen worse.
I think we'll get
out of here.
Hey, Buddy.
You made it out.
Janice. I was
gonna call you.
Yeah. I was gonna
hold my breath.
Nice talking to you.
So, did we like
your dog and pony show?
Well, what can I say,
you know?
Love at fưrst sight.
Lucky us.
So, you on the 6:00?
Yes, I am.
Just about
to push it back.
- No.
- Mm-hmm.
God damn it.
Well, time for a drink?
Yeah, that's why they
called me in on my day off.
Drinks with the freight.
So, next time, yeah?
I'll call you.
Whatever.
[Loud Chatter]
Whoa. Sorry.
Sorry, it's this bag.
I don't know where I am.
It's all right, man.
You got your whole
<i>Let's Go: Europe</i> thing
happening there.
I understand.
Eurail pass, yogurt,
get stoned,
see the Anne Frank House.
Sorry?
Sit down. Join us.
Have a drink.
- This is Mimi.
- Hi.
We've known each other
for, what, 5 minutes?
I think she's bored
with me already.
<i>Greg: Well, thanks. </i>
<i>Sure, why not? </i>
<i>The line at the snack bar</i>
<i>is like an hour. </i>
Oh, God.
Let me guess...
English teacher.
Let me guess... agent.
[Laughs]
Advertising.
It's like agenting
without the heart.
Am I that much
of a clich<i>é</i>?
Hey,
don't look at me.
I'm just sitting
here eating nuts.
And I'm not a teacher.
I'm a writer.
<i>Buddy: A writer? </i>
<i>That's what I started out at. </i>
Couldn't make a living.
I write for TV.
TV? So that "I'm so much
better than you" look
I saw on your face
when I said advertising,
I must have imagined it.
Maybe on his face
you imagined it.
<i>Greg: I got nothing</i>
<i>against advertising. </i>
<i>It pays me, I guess. </i>
That's right, it does.
What do you do again?
I told you. I'm with
the National Organ Center.
I'm in development.
Gotta love that.
She's in
organ development.
<i>Buddy: Can't... </i>
<i>[Laughs]</i>
She has this whole
great speech on here
that David Crosby
gives, actually,
about transplants
and stuff.
It's pretty compelling.
I write plays, too.
That's what I was
doing in Chicago.
A play of mine
opened.
What TV shows?
It was no big deal.
A little theater.
I'm here again next week.
I love plays.
No, it closed.
It closed.
Um, it was a limited...
It's called
<i>Lilacs in the Dooryard. </i>
<i>Buddy: I wonder why</i>
<i>we have plays anymore. </i>
Hello? We got movies.
Check a movie out.
<i>Buddy: </i>
<i>Know what I mean? </i>
Hmm, not in here.
Yeah.
What's a dooryard?
It's from a Whitman poem.
"When lilacs last in
the dooryard bloomed."
Well, yeah...
What is a dooryard?
Oh, look. They just
put sandwiches out.
Oh, great. OK.
Oh, man. Another line.
I think I'm actually going
to check on my flight.
Want me to check yours?
Where you headed?
Dallas.
L.A.
L.A.? Me, too.
OK, I'll be back
in a minute.
<i>Buddy: </i>
<i>Thanks a lot. </i>
<i>Greg: </i>
<i>All right. And thanks. </i>
You don't know what
a dooryard is.
This is what it is.
You have no idea.
<i>Buddy: This Greg guy</i>
<i>better stick to writing TV. </i>
<i>Did you read this review? </i>
Boy, they don't like something,
they don't keep it a secret.
<i>Mimi: </i>
<i>Here he comes. </i>
Hey, we thought
we'd lost you.
So, you're still on
for 10:00.
They say
it's gonna take off.
Nothing for Dallas yet.
Yeah, it'll be tomorrow
at the earliest.
Bet the airport hotels
are swamped.
Take this hotel voucher.
Room's guaranteed.
I'll stick around and see
if something opens up.
You took a bump?
2 coach tickets anywhere
in the U.S. or Mexico
plus 200 bucks.
I did this show
down in Mexico,
and I promised my kids
I'd take them.
200 and coach?
I should have haggled?
He's pulling your leg.
You did great.
Tell my wife that.
Abby.
Just gave her
the good news.
Turns out I was supposed to
work the Christmas tree lot
with Scott tomorrow.
I forgot.
Father-son
Cub Scout thing.
You have
any pictures?
Yeah, sure.
Oh, she's pretty.
<i>Greg: Isn't she? </i>
<i>Our neighbor</i>
<i>Donna and Abby. </i>
They went to the mall and did
these glamor photo things.
<i>Mimi: How old</i>
<i>are your boys? </i>
Scott's 7 and Joey's 4.
Oh, he's so cute.
<i>Buddy: Say hello! </i>
Jesus, you're not taping
over the Crosby speech?
Relax. I fast-forwarded.
Crosby's fưne. He's there.
Here you go. Say something
for the transplant kids.
Well, save a life
and become a donor.
Do what David Crosby said.
What did David say?
"Sorry I drank.
Thanks for the liver."
We... We are here,
for one thing,
to celebrate the opening
and the closing...
Oh, no, please.
of the new play,
<i>When Lilacs Something Dooryard. </i>
And we're here
with the author...
Greg. Janello.
And I want to say
that the critic for
the <i>Chicago Weekly Times</i>
is an idiot
and an asshole...
You read
the review?
who wouldn't
know a good play
if it punched him
in the face.
And, Abby, please,
forgive him.
Yeah, please.
He did it for you.
I did. I love you.
Ah, that's me.
Well...
I'm gonna go
to the men's room.
So, it was great
meeting you guys,
thanks for,
you know, nuts.
You, too, man.
Nice meeting you.
<i>Greg: Good luck getting</i>
<i>wherever you're going. </i>
You, too. Good night.
See you.
Well, if you ever
get to Dallas.
Hey, Greg. Greg!
Hey.
Go sell
a Christmas tree for me.
What?
Go ahead, take it.
I want the layover,
if you know what I mean.
You know, Mimi,
organ development,
video camera,
think about it.
<i>Greg: This is</i>
<i>incredibly generous. </i>
It's a comp. It's free.
Take it. It's fưne.
Oh. Oops.
Hey.
Hello, sir.
I really appreciate it.
Look, man,
you're doing me a favor.
You're saving my marriage.
You have no idea.
Take care of yourself.
Thanks a lot.
See you.
It was great
meeting you.
Your ticket?
You know what?
You just took it.
What?
Still have
that hotel voucher?
Don't you just
love air travel?
<i>Stewardess: Can I get you</i>
<i>something else, sir? </i>
<i>Something</i>
<i>to drink? </i>
What? Sorry.
<i>Stewardess: Can I get you</i>

Infưnity flight 82,
the last flight to take off

[Telephone Rings]

Hello?
Mom, what is it?
Is something wrong?
Chicago. No, he's coming
back tomorrow. What...
What?
Oh, Jesus.
They said Infưnity?
No, no, no.
He's not taking that.
I spoke to him.
Mother, stop it.
Will you put Les
on the phone, please?
Just put...
[Thud]
Ohh...
Les...
What's the flight number?
[Sighs]
Oh, thank God.
No, he's not on that flight.
He's coming back tomorrow.
He hasn't even left yet.
Tell her...
What is she saying?
Because he probably
doesn't know.
He's in an airport hotel
or something.
Listen, I'll call you
as soon as I know anything.
I just don't want to tie up
the phone right now.
OK.

No. He's taking

When's the last time
you spoke to him?
Um, well, last night
at about 8:00.
8:00. That's
10 p.m., Chicago.
We have conflicting

One of them, we can't tell
yet if it's accurate or not,
one of them lists your

No. I know he got...
he got bumped.
He's on a later flight.
We have a crisis center

Nope.

We don't have

I'll be brief.
I want to thank you all
for your ideas,
but, uh, I'm gonna
recommend to the board
that we go with the concept
thatJosh and Sharon
have been working on.
That's Karen,
actually.
It's based on a wire photo
out of Chicago.
I'm gonna need someone
<i>Exner: to lockdown the rights</i>
<i>on this, pronto. </i>
[Scoffs]
Is that a joke?
[Laughs]
You got to be kidding me.
You're not gonna run
this sentimental,
self-serving crap.
Excuse me?
Who cares how
Infưnity Airlines feel?
Who gives a shit?
They crashed the plane.
<i>Buddy: So what? Right? </i>
<i>Happens all the time. </i>
<i>They'll do</i>
<i>an investigation. </i>
<i>The FAA in 10 months will</i>
<i>say it was a hydraulic line</i>
or a fuel line or a rudder
or something, right?
<i>Buddy: </i>
<i>I mean, shit happens. </i>
Happens to TWA,
happens to Delta,
happens to United.
Why are we gonna take
responsibility for bad luck?
I don't think we want
to hide our heads in the sand.
Plus, you don't
originate campaigns.
OK, Karen?
Neither do you, Josh.
We all do, together.
<i>Jim: Buddy, </i>
this is not about running
the ball around you.
OK, let's get on this,

This is, uh, this is

<i>Buddy: Thank you</i>
<i>for this award. It's great. </i>
<i>Um, boy, it's so heavy. </i>
That's what you're supposed
to say, right?
That and, uh, "Oh, this is
what it looks like up close."
It's, uh... But thank you.
This is great.
It's good to see
all of you.
It really is.
'Cause I've been, uh...
I haven't been around much
this year, and, uh...
you know...
You see, I was supposed
to be on that flight.
Aw.
It's ironic, 'cause I could
have been one of those people
who believed so much
in Infưnity Airlines
that they were glad to die
just so it could show
how well it handled it,
really.
Isn't that
what we're saying?
" Hey, we crashed,
but we're hurting,
and we're humble,
and, uh,
we're ready to sell
some tickets."
All right. Thank you!
Thank you very much.
Um, thank you,

How could you be in good shape?
I've been gone for 90 days.
Hey, hey, you've
been gone for a year
since the crash,
but who's counting?
You look good, though.

He wants to get out of

He'll do it for 1.8

It's apple juice.
<i>Seth: Hey. </i>
Uh, you don't want

Are you kidding?
I'm not gay.
No, but I am.
And you are my boss.
At least, offưcially, so...
Since when?
Since about a week after they
shipped you to Palm Springs.
You had some sort of a breakdown
during an awards ceremony?
Or that... that's what I heard.
It wasn't a breakdown,
OK? It was an episode.
What do you do here
exactly?
Uh, P.A.
Offưce floater.
I work with the computers
mostly.
Would that have been
your fưrst drink
since they released you?
[Shuts Off Faucet]
Boy, you got
some nerve, kid.
Relax.
I'm a drunk, too.
6 years sober.
A.A. and N.A.
And we hired you?
I had to sign
a "no-episode" clause,
but yeah. [Laughs]
Look, if you want some help
with your re-entry,
I'd be happy to oblige.
Just don't screw up.
There's a lot of really
nice people working here,
and why should they pay
for your shit?
'Cause I own 20%
of the company.
And in case you were
picking pimples
when they covered this
in your rehab,
alcoholism is a disease.
Yeah. Yeah. You can catch it
from open bottles.
You're not gonna
make me feel guilty
for something
I had no control of.
Oh, you're that type.
Cool.
When was the last time
anything was your fault?
I don't believe this guy.
Did they do A.A. up
where they dried you out?
You know, the whole
12 steps, all that jazz?
Yeah, yeah, they tried,
but I don't believe in God.
He'll be crushed
when he fưnds out.

Ow.
I'm... I'm actually between
beeper numbers at the moment,
so, you know,
just ignore that. Um...
Maybe you should
let him out.
So, um, what line of
business are you in?
What's his name?
The dog,
what's his name?
Fred.
[Dog Barking,
Banging]
<i>Abby: You know what? </i>
<i>He doesn't like people, </i>
and he's not trained,
'cause I've only
had him a year.
[Snarling]
[Whistles]
Hey, Fred, it's OK.
Hey, Fred, Fred,
come here.
That's it, Fred. See?
I'm great with dogs.
Fred!
Rottweilers are great.
I had one
when I was a kid.
Fred, good boy.
Here you go. See?
[Dog's Barking
Decreases]
Yeah.
You know what? Actually,
do you mind coming back?
Oh, my God, my boss
is coming right now,
and, uh, I think
it would be better
if you came
at, like, noon.
I'm sorry.
Is something wrong?
I didn't say it was
a rottweiler, OK?
[Dog Barking]
I saw you...
I saw you
with the dog outside.
That was half an hour ago.
You said you were just...
you were just passing by.
I was. I was passing by
half an hour ago,
I went to a meeting,
and I came here.
I swear to God,
if you say one more word,
I'm... I'm gonna
open this door.
All right. Whoa,
all right. Hold on.
All right.
You don't understand.
Everything's fưne, OK?
Easy, easy, Fred. Fred!
<i>Abby: Get out! </i>
Fred! No, Fred!
<i>Abby: Buddy! Stop it! </i>
Buddy! Buddy, stop it!
I'm just lying here.
I'm not doing anything!
- Not you, the dog! Buddy!
- <i>Buddy: Dog? </i>
<i>Abby: </i>
<i>Come on, Buddy! </i>
Ow! My leg!
<i>Abby: Come on. </i>
Come on. All right.
<i>Buddy: You told me</i>
<i>the dog's name was Fred? </i>
<i>Abby: Sorry. </i>
God damn it.
<i>My God! </i>
I probably pissed him off
calling him Fred.
What was I supposed
to do, you know?
You can't go around
telling a client
that they've got
a dog's name.
You all right?
Tch. No, I'm not.
Look at this.
The jacket,
the pants.
I didn't see
a license on the dog.
Does the dog
have a license?
Oh, my God, please.
You don't understand.
I cannot lose this job, OK?
If you cause trouble,
I... I...
Please, you've got
to let me take care of it.
<i>Abby: I got him about</i>
<i>a year ago for my boys. </i>
They like him.
It's just, ahh...
It's a lot of work,
and... I don't know.
I think they think of him
as a consolation prize
for their father.
He, um...
divorced me last year.
Well, we... we
divorced each other.
Oh.
I didn't do it
to bribe them, I swear.
I just thought that,
you know,
it would be
a good distraction.
[Sighs] It worked better
on Joey, because he's only 5.
Yeah. I was almost
married once myself.
A couple of years ago.
Really? What happened?
Oh, I don't know.
Some couples are lucky,
some aren't.
Yeah.
We weren't so lucky.
Greg used to, uh...
write for this TV show
call <i>The Midnighter. </i>
Did... Do you ever watch that?
It's syndicated.
He wrote some episodes.
I mean... I mean, he still,
you know, writes episodes
'cause he's on staff.
Only took 2 puffs
of your last one.
That's 'cause I don't
really smoke. [Coughs]
Yeah. Well, last year,
I started chewing the gum,
you know?
Because my friend Donna,
she was trying to quit smoking,
and she found that the gum
was soothing to the nerves,
so I started chewing it,
then I got hooked on the gum,
and then I got TMJ
from the chewing,
so this I just do to
get me off the gum.
I'm 10 days
off the gum.
Sounds like
a good plan.
Next week,
you'll be on heroin.
<i>Woman: Hey, mister. </i>
<i>Hey, mister, it's ready. </i>
See? An hour or less.
Look at that.
Um, listen, when you...
when you get the bill,
you know, for having
the pants rewoven,
I want you
to send it to me.
There's my number.
I'm serious, please.
Please. Not a discussion.
Thank you.
[Sighs]
Ohh.
Thanks.
Sure.
Come on, babe.
Well, it was nice
to meet you, Buddy.
[Sighs]
You, uh, you weren't
really interested
in seeing any property,
were you?
Copies. The sign's
still up there.
Then you launched
into your whole spiel,
and the dog, and I...
OK, OK. I know,
I'm... I'm sorry.
It was nice to meet you.
Yeah, you, too.
- Take care.
- Bye-bye.
[Dog Choking]
Ohh, for God's sake.
What the hell
did you eat?
[Siren]
<i>TV: The thing</i>
<i>about heroes... </i>
<i>Buddy: Yeah, Judy. </i>
<i>Tell Karen that the color</i>
<i>on the GMC animatic</i>
is way, way too hot.
And before we test,
I want to go non-announced
on the V.O.
You know, get the guy
who did Southwest
for us last summer.
You... Listen to this.
<i>TV: In the tradition of</i>
<i>the great GMC truck... </i>
OK? Not that.
Come on, guys.
[Clicks OffTV]
Get it together.
Oh.
[Hums]
<i>Abby: Hey, Scott, </i>
<i>I said lights out. </i>
<i>I mean it. </i>
[Telephone Rings]
Hello.
<i>Buddy: Uh, hello, </i>
<i>uh, is this AbbyJanello? </i>
Uh, yes. This is...
This is her... she.
<i>Uh, this is Buddy Amaral. </i>
Oh.
<i>You know, the guy</i>
<i>from the strip mall. </i>
Mm-hmm. Of course.
Um, did... did you get
an estimate on the pants?
<i>No. Don't worry</i>
<i>about the suit. </i>
<i>It's business, right? </i>
<i>Listen... </i>
my fưrm, Tang-Weller, we're,
uh, we're relocating here.
We're trying to get out
of this building,
<i>Buddy: and our current realtors</i>
<i>aren't quite cutting it, </i>
<i>and I thought, you know, </i>
<i>maybe you could help us out. </i>
Me?
Uh, you know what?
I don't, uh...
<i>Buddy: We got about</i>
<i>7,000 square feet here. </i>
<i>We need about</i>
<i>3 or 4 times as much. </i>
To buy, not to lease.
Somewhere under 2.
<i>Buddy: </i>
<i>Can you do that? </i>
Million. 2 million.
<i>Buddy: Yeah. </i>
<i>What do you think? </i>
You know, why me?
You know?
I honestly don't have
the experience.
'Cause you're hungry.
You'll try harder,
you know?
I'm hungry
because I suck.
<i>Abby: </i>
<i>OK? You know what? </i>
<i>Let me put you</i>
<i>in touch with Norma, </i>
<i>because she's really</i>
<i>the one that handles</i>...
You know, I would rather
that, uh, you did it.
And could you come by the offưce
around 10:00 on Monday?
And it'd be great
if you had 2 or 3 properties
<i>to show us right then, </i>
<i>you know, in the same area. </i>
<i>Venice, Santa Monica, </i>
<i>Marina Del Rey. </i>
And there's one property
in particular
that I'd like you
to show us on Abbott Kinney.
<i>Buddy: 18385</i>...
Uh, hold on one sec.
<i>18385 Abbott Kinney. </i>
<i>The seller is primed. </i>
In fact, he doesn't even
have a broker, so...
Who knows? Maybe you can book
a double commission.
[Sighs] I can give it
a shot, you know, but, uh...
<i>Buddy: Great. I'll call you</i>
<i>at your office tomorrow</i>
<i>and fax over the specifics</i>...
<i>what we're looking for, </i>
<i>that kind of thing. </i>
<i>You OKwith this? </i>
Uh, yes. Yeah, sure.
It's fưne.
Thank you.
Great. All right.
Good night.
[Beep]
[Sighs] He wants to
give me some business.
I'll bet.
<i>Dionne: Yeah, yeah, </i>
<i>I know, I know. </i>
<i>Well, </i>
<i>when do you need it by? </i>
Hi. I'm AbbyJanello.
I'm here to see
Buddy Amaral.
I'm early.
Should I just sit down?
Oh, sorry.
OK, well,
it's on its way.
Excuse me.
Abby?
Oh, hi.
Hey.
Gee, I hope you're not
getting too optimistic.
You're unpacking
already?
Oh, no. There...
Uh, there...
there was a problem
with this, uh,
the matte job.
I don't think
they were acid-free,
which is key for matting.
You should always make sure
that your mattes are acid-free,
otherwise, you'll, uh...
you'll...
Have acid.
Exactly.
Well...
I read through the materials
that you faxed over
about your setup
and your business here,
and, uh... oh, I... I don't know
much about advertising,
if you don't count <i>Bewitched. </i>
Well, we got our share
of twitching noses here,
but with our
drug-intervention program,
that's on the decline.
Joke.
Oh, that's very funny.
Did you fưnd
any properties?
Yeah, I, uh... I have 3 besides
the one that you mentioned.
The owner gave you
the listing?
Yeah, but I had to promise him
that I'd get a higher price
to make up for the commission.
Um, there is an offer for 1.8,
but it... it seems fưshy.
Yeah, look,
you know what?
When you bring it up
toJim,
just say you found it.
Who's Jim?
Jim's my partner.
Partner and boss, sort of.
Remember Larry Tate?
He doesn't always
like my ideas.
Uh, I think if you
said it was yours...
Oh, I don't know.
I don't know if I'm
so comfortable with that.
<i>Jim: Ah. You must be... </i>
AbbyJanello,
Vinegrove Realty.
You must be Larry.
Jim.
Jim. I'm pleased
to meet you.
Ah. Well, hey,
any friend of Buddy's.
Um, so, you two guys
met at Palm Springs?
No. No, I...
Well, should we
get going?
- Is your car outside?
- Uh, yeah.
Listen, I've got the meeting
with the attorney at 1:00,
so we should probably
take 2 cars.
OK. Um, I'll drive us,
if that's OKwith you.
Uh, sure. Great. I just have
papers in the car I should...
Or we can just meet you
right out front?
OK.
Don't mention Palm Springs.
It's supposed to be
anonymous.
Oh, right, oh, right.
And... And you made
a Larry Tate crack
before I came in.
No.
Half an hour maybe.
She's got one more space
to show me,
so I should be there
before...
Oh, shit.
No. Not this building.
[Beep]
Ohh.
[Alarm Chirps]
Buddy.
Can I speak
with you?
I do have other...
This is the building.
Oh, you think so?
No, no,
this is <i>the</i> building,
the one I want.
The photos?
Oh. I gave her
the specs.
I guess there's only so much
inventory on the market.
I'm gonna kill him.
I mean, we had a deal,
and now he goes
and gets himself a broker.
Look, we can't let her
show us this.
We got to get out of here
before the broker shows up.
Abby, when's the seller's
broker showing up?
Um, I'm... I'm
the seller's broker.
It's my listing.
<i>Abby: Look, I understand</i>
<i>your disappointment, </i>
but the seller was bound
to get some advice.
No one would let him
do a deal of that size
without a broker
or a lawyer or someone.
Thank you.
And how did he happen
to, uh, fưnd you?
Um, I approached him.
Look, he's gonna list it 2.1,
and that's still under market.
He was gonna sell it
to me for 1.8.
Well, say you go in at 1.9.
What were you putting down?
We were thinking of 30%
of 1.8 at a fưxed 81/2.
You'd be tying up a lot of cash
for a commercial property.
I mean, I say you go in
at 20, 25 at the most
and free up
some of that cash.
30% of 1.8 is what?
540K.
I say you go in at 20%,
1.9...
That's 380K.
Meaning we fưnance 1-5-20
at 73/4,
and I can source
that cheaper for you.
<i>Abby: That's, um... </i>
<i>10,880 a month. </i>
<i>That's a $ 1,200 difference. </i>
<i>You can pass that on easy. </i>
I don't know.
Are you, uh...
waiting for me
to offer to kick in
some commission?
Well, this is
an easy deal for you.
It's not like you
had to knock around
for 6 months to fưnd it.
OK. One point.
That's a check
for 20k at escrow.
But that's it,
you know, because...
he can get 2.1 if he waits
even 2 months, but...
you know, whatever
you want to do, so...
Well, thank you
for your time.
All right, all right.
Bring it by my offưce,
and, uh...
I'll sign it.
Thank you.
Yes, I will.
Mm-hmm.
[Gasps]
Wow.
How long you been
doing this?
Oh, my God.
I don't even know
where the words came from.
[Laughs]
I did feel terrible
about lying, though.
<i>Buddy: </i>
<i>Oh, you didn't lie. </i>
You just didn't tell
the whole truth.
Yeah, well,
like I tell my kids,
that's called lying.
My God. [Gasps]
Norma is gonna die.
This is so out
of my league.
I always got the feeling
that she gave me the job
out of pity.
You know,
my divorce and...
Well, maybe this will get
you off strip mall patrol.
God,
wouldn't that be great?
Um, so, why did he think that
we, uh, met in Palm Springs?
Is he mixing me up with
a girlfriend or something?
Mmm. I don't know.
I might have told him you
were a friend of a friend.
Jim doesn't
like realtors.
I'm the salesman, you know?
He doesn't like salesmen.
I like salesmen.
Greg had a thing
against salesmen, too.
He wouldn't let Scott sell
chocolate bars for the school,
'cause he didn't want
his kids selling anything.
<i>Abby: I mean, </i>
<i>he still doesn't. </i>
And now I am.
It's funny.
OK, so, um, do you just want me
to write this up here, or...
Yeah, that's fưne.
OK.
Um, thank you.
I owe you.
Don't worry about it.
<i>Buddy: Take care. </i>
OK.
Yup, thanks.
Well, we're gonna
have trouble
from legal on 8.
You know what?
Forget it.
Ship it.
Let them tell us.
[Signs]
There you go.
Thanks.
Hey.
Hey.
What are you
doing here?
Uh... [Sighs]
Well, I was just
in the area, I guess.
Wow. It looks like
the move's on track.
Yeah. Yeah. It's, uh...
this weekend.
You need Jim?
Um, no, I just, uh...
[Laughs]
Um... I just wanted to...
What?
[Laughs]
I wanted to thank you.
I, uh...
Well, I got 2 tickets
for the Dodgers.
I know you like them
because I saw your coffee mug.
They're for Friday.
I thought we could,
you know, go, or...
if you want, or... or you
could just have them.
Both, if you're... if you're...
if you're seeing...
if you have a friend
who likes them.
Well, that's really nice.
I... I, um, thank you.
Oh, shit. Friday.
I have a... a...
business dinner.
These clients are coming
down from San Francisco.
No, that's been moved
to Monday, remember?
- Is it?
- Mm-hmm.
And it's
a lunch.
Well, great.
The Dodgers.
Excuse me,
I think this is my seat.
Oh, hi.
Um, somebody... I think
that's back there.
Someone's sitting here.
I'm sorry.
<i>Dido: </i>
§<i>I didn't hear you leave</i> §
§<i>I wonder</i>

§<i>And I don't want</i>

Buddy: You know, I don't think
I've ever bought a woman
a grilled-cheese sandwich
before.
[Abby Laughs]
Well, that's what
my boys always order,
and after a while,
you know,
you kind of get
hooked on them.
There's probably some kind
of gum for that, too, right?
[Giggles]
§<i>I'll do what I want</i> §
You want to sit
for a while?
Yeah, sure.
Is this your car?
No.
This is Greg's,
my, ahem, my ex.
Mine's in the shop,
so...
Sittin' in cars
at the diner.
I never did that,
did you?
No. No diners.
Bars.
I had a baby in a car.
Joey.
I mean,
not actually in the car.
We made it to the E.R.,
but...
Not this car.
Ha ha ha.
It was a Datsun,
remember those?
I had it in school.
I was...
Well, Greg was driving,
and I just knew I was
gonna have this baby,
and he would not pull over.
So I got it in my mind
that, you know,
I didn't want to have
the baby in the front seat.
You know,
like it wasn't safe.
So I tried to climb
in the back seat.
And I broke his nose
with my foot.
I had this contraction
and pow,
I just got him right there.
And he could not drive,
I mean, the blood was pouring.
So I had to drive the rest
of the way to the hospital,
screaming and crying
and driving.
[Sighs]
And he had
a beautiful nose.
I mean, you know,
a good face, handsome, but...
a beautiful nose.
That's all I could think about
the whole time I was delivering.
Oh, I ruined his nose.
And later, you know...
He didn't even know
he did this, but...
when we'd have a fưght,
you know, he'd kind of
touch his nose like...
You know, like Danny Kaye
in <i>White Christmas</i>
with the arm.
Like, "You owe me, pal."
Oh, God, it used
to make me so mad.
What?
I don't know how women
get so brave.
That's all.
You think that's brave?
I was so scared.
God, I'm always
so scared.
It's not brave
if you're not scared.
Well...
You have a good face, too.
OK.
[Laughs Nervously]
Well...
um, thank you.
Thanks for the tickets.
No problem.
Good night.
Good night.
[Starts Engine]
Good night.
What do you think?
It's fưne.
You get a window,
I get to work for a guy
who gets a window.
What are you doing
in here already?
It's not even 8:00.
I'm early.
How'd the date go
with the realtor?
It was fưne, I guess.
Fine, huh?
I thought she was nice.
What happened?
What is this,
Gay Confưdant Day?
Want me to hang on
while you go get a blow-dryer?
Hey, I don't
give a shit.
I'm just making
conversation.
Well, it went fưne,
you know.
I'm not interested,
so, uh...
if she calls,
just, uh, tell her I'm out,
or tell her I'm busy
and take a message
and tell her I'll get back
to her, OK?
And if she calls back?
Just keep taking messages.
She'll get the point.
You know, that's what I
love about working for you.
It's a total freedom
from hero-worship.
It's very refreshing.
<i>Buddy: </i>
<i>Look, you're the client. </i>
<i>That's not what I'm saying. </i>
I'm just saying
it's not in sync
with your ram positioning.
It's Jim on 3. Urgent.
Right.
OK. Can I call you
right back?
All right, thanks. Bye.
What's up, Jim?
<i>Abby: No, it's Abby. </i>
<i>It's</i>... <i>It's AbbyJanello. </i>
<i>H</i>-<i>Hi. </i>
Hey. I just... I thought
you were somebody else.
<i>Buddy: Um... </i>
How are you?
I, uh...
I had a really good time
the other night.
Really?
Um, listen, I'm just
across the street,
and I've got all these
extra sets of keys
for the doors
and everything,
and I thought
maybe I could, um...
you know, buy you
and Jim a drink
to celebrate moving in.
Jim's in a meeting.
Uh, and I... I don't drink.
<i>Buddy: Uh... </i>
Oh.
Um, uh, OK. I can
just, uh, mail them.
How about 10 minutes?
OK. Great.
<i>Buddy: </i>
<i>I'll see you there. </i>
[Beep]
You know what, Seth?
That's not funny.
OK? You don't know what
you're messing with.
Hey.
Hey.
I ordered you
a club soda.
I hope that's OK.
Yeah. That's fưne.
[Clears Throat]
You know, my husband
didn't drink, either.
Not even champagne
at our wedding.
I used to drink.
I just don't anymore.
Oh.
A.A.?
Yeah. 6 months.
Oh.
Well, that's great.
I had an uncle
who was in A.A.,
and he was, like,
a really bad drunk.
So was I.
I'm sorry. I don't know
why I said that.
The drinking
wasn't the worst part.
It was the thinking
I was such hot stuff.
I've always been
one of those people.
Born salesman. A closer.
People person.
Ew.
But I wasn't,
not by a long shot.
It's like
how everybody thinks
that they have
a good sense of humor
or good taste.
Or they're
a good driver.
[Sighs]
I'd be driving along,
and I'd, uh, happen to look up
in the rearview mirror.
And there'd be all these...
bloody people and crashed cars
in the street,
and I'd think, "Jesus,
there's a lot of bad drivers
in this neighborhood."
That was me with people.
I'd like to, uh...
[Sighs]
I'd like to tell you
that I've wised up...
but I don't know.
Yeah.
I get it.
You're bad
with relationships.
And as a person
who's standing
in the road ahead
of you, thanks.
I'll be, uh...
getting on
the sidewalk now.
Abby...
No. You know,
it's OK. I...
I took a shot, you know?
I think
I misread stuff, and...
I'm sorry.
I'm just really
grateful to you
for throwing me the sale
and everything.
Bye.
Abby.
Abby.
Abby, wait a second,
all right?
I am not divorced,
Buddy.
My husband died
a little over
a year ago,
and I am sorry that I wasn't
honest with you about it,
but you know what?
It's too soon for me,
and it is way too soon
for my boys,
so just leave me alone.
I'm sorry.
Everybody's sorry.
And nobody's to blame,
except, you know,
sometimes I think exactly
the opposite is true.
God. Do you have
a cigarette?
No. Abby, I...
I'm sorry
that I lied to you,
but I liked thinking of
me and Greg as divorced.
Everybody's divorced.
It feels like
a decision we made
instead of fate
or bad luck
or chance...
Plane crash.
Come on, please.
Let's just go back inside
and start over, OK?
Don't be nice to me.
Everybody is nice
to widows.
You were the fưrst
person in over a year
<i>Abby: who was nice</i>
<i>to me who didn't know. </i>
Listen...
I was wrong in there.
I just didn't
want you to think
I was this great guy.
I wanted to tell you before
you found out for yourself.
I got scared.
What is it
that you want, Buddy?
Your company.
The pleasure
of your company.
I want your input
on video rentals.
I stand there for hours,
and I can't pick anything out.
I want someone
to say good night to,
a last call of the day.
I don't have a last call
of the day.
Do you?
Don't feel sorry for me.
I'm happy.
I'm widow happy.
I'm widow-with-2-kids
happy.
If you grade on a curve,
I'm happy.
I don't feel sorry
for you.
OK?
Oh, OK.
Oh, well.
OK, then nothing
with knives, snakes,
or women that have to go
undercover as hookers.
The videos.
[Laughs]
OK.
<i>Donna: Don't worry. I don't</i>
<i>think he's bored, do you? </i>
<i>Abby: </i>
<i>Honey, it's a cookout. </i>
<i>Of course he's bored. </i>
<i>Aren't you? </i>
<i>Donna: </i>
<i>So, how far's he gone? </i>
Nowhere.
You know, he's nice.
It's no big deal.
Mm-hmm.
It's just that, um...
you know when
you go to a table,
and a guy does that,
like, halfway thing,
like he's going
to stand up?
He does that.
I love when guys do that.

<i>Scott: Mom... </i>
can I be excused?
Yes, you may be excused.
Wait, wait, wait.
CD-Rom, not AOL, OK?
<i>Abby: </i>
<i>It costs money. </i>
<i>Buddy: Hey, do you</i>
<i>have</i> Where's Waldo?
I'm 8, OK?
<i>Scott: Come on, Joey. </i>
Mama?
<i>Abby: It's OK. </i>
<i>You can take that in. </i>
Just don't put the drink
on the desk.
OK.
I knew I shouldn't have
brought up Waldo.
Well, he is 8.
<i>Abby: I mean... </i>
<i>Woman: Hey, here, </i>
<i>let me help you. </i>
<i>Abby: Oh, no, no, no. </i>

[Music Playing On TV]
[Turns Off]
<i>Man: And you're ready</i>
<i>for takeoff. </i>
<i>Buddy: Hey, Scott. </i>
<i>What are you doing? </i>
<i>Man: We're losing</i>
<i>altitude. </i>
Losing.
<i>Man: </i>
<i>Pull up, pull up! </i>
Yeah?
Is it hard?
I'm done.
You can play.
[Sighs]
<i>Man: And you're ready</i>
<i>for takeoff. </i>
<i>We're losing altitude. </i>
<i>Pull up, pull up! </i>
<i>Abby: Sorry. </i>
He's still very angry.
Thanks.
It's OK.
He's angry at me.
He's angry at Greg.
He's angry atJoey.
Sorry.
And he's scared to fly.
You know, I was thinking
of maybe taking them
on a little flying trip
somewhere close,
<i>Abby: so that</i>
<i>if they can't make it, </i>
<i>I can rent a car</i>
<i>and drive back. </i>
Sounds good.
Could work.
That's a nice computer.
Yeah. Ahem.
Greg got it
to celebrate his play.
He had this play on
in Chicago.
<i>Abby: That's why</i>
<i>he was there. </i>
<i>"Lilacs in the Dooryard. "</i>
Not the title
I voted for.
I mean, who knows what
a dooryard is anyway?
<i>Abby: Weird. </i>
[Laughs]
He wasn't even supposed
to be on that flight.
<i>Abby: Even the paperwork</i>
<i>was all wrong, you know? </i>
<i>Which really</i>
<i>made me crazy, </i>
<i>because it got me</i>
<i>thinking... </i>
like, if I was,
you know,
getting the boys ready
to put them on the bus,
and Donna would say,
"Oh, I'm going down there.
You know,
I'll just take them."
And I would think...
[Sighs]
"Well, which one's
supposed to crash?"
You know? I mean, do I
send them with Donna,
or do I put them
on the bus?
Which one is doomed?
<i>Abby: Or is the whole thing</i>
<i>going to happen tomorrow? </i>
It's crazy.
Abby...
What?
Do you have a good lawyer?
<i>Buddy: For your case</i>
<i>against the airline? </i>
Uh, I don't really know.
I think so. You know,
I'm just sort of
in with the group
of other families.
I have his card
right there,
<i>Abby: if you want</i>
<i>to see it. </i>
Abby: I've got a meeting
with him on Thursday.
Yeah.
Ahem. Well...
What I can do,
if you like,
is have our lawyers
call around
and ask some questions
about him.
For free.
Oh, I see. You're after
my money now, is that it?
Yeah. Well,
not just the money...
what the money can buy.
Buddy: Hey, Scott.
Uh, thank you very much.
Yeah, thanks.
Thanks for coming by.
It's great to see you.
I'll let myself out, OK?
Abby:
Mm-hmm. Ahem.
Buddy:
See you, pal.
Aah!
[Both Laugh]
[Doorbell Buzzes]
[Doorbell Buzzes]
<i>Buddy: OK, coming. </i>
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm sorry. I just...
I didn't know where to go,
and Donna has the kids.
That's fưne. I'm glad
I was here when you called.
Come on in.
Do you want some dinner
or a drink or...
<i>Buddy: </i>
<i>Here. Sit down. </i>
[Sighs]
I settled.
I saw my lawyer today,
and I settled.
OK.
It's not OK.
It's like saying,
you know, I'm fưne.
I'm over it.
That's what everybody
wants me to feel anyway...
even Donna,
who's been so good.
Or my mother.
"It's only
a plane crash, sweetie.
You got to bounce."
That was her take on it.
So that's what
I've been doing...
bouncing.
It's just like crashing,
except you get to do it
over and over again.
Yeah. I know
what you mean.
<i>Buddy: I mean, </i>
<i>I can imagine</i>
<i>how that might feel. </i>
It's the way
they talk about him...
like he's this saint.
And I don't even
recognize
who they're talking about
anymore.
[Sighs]
It's not that he wasn't
a really good man, you know?
He was. He was
a really good man...
but he wasn't perfect.
He was a little tight
with money, for one thing.
I want to blame him...
or to be angry at him
or whatever, because...
when I don't...
he gets really far away.
God.
And I did love him,
you know?
I really did love him.
[Sighs]
[Sighs]
<i>Buddy: You sure you don't</i>
<i>want me to drive you home? </i>
At least follow you?
No. I'm fưne.
Listen, I know
what you're thinking.
I'm this widow, and
I've got these 2 kids,
and I'm probably
not ready.
At least, that's what
I think to myself
half the time.
So...
You're off the hook, OK?
You don't have to say
another word.
Can I see you
this weekend?
No.
No. This weekend
is our little test trip
down to Palm Springs.
Oh, right.
We had to drive
to the funeral,
because Scott wouldn't
get on the plane.
And I really
don't want my kids
to spend the rest
of their lives
afraid to fly.
But Monday, maybe.
Yeah.
Or I could come
with you guys.
Uh... I wouldn't
mention Waldo.
[Laughs]
I did promise them
the water park.
What, they're afraid
of water now, too?
Come on.
It'll be fun.
OK.
It's... It's
a big plane, right?
I think so.
Because those would be
better for the kids.
Abby: The captain
let you go up there
and everything.
Scott: Whatever.
That was all right,
huh, guys?
There was a few bumps,
but I was, you know...
Abby: Sir,
do we need to discuss
a little
attitude adjustment
before we get
to the water park?
Buddy: Come on.
Abby:
What do you think?
<i>Man: </i>§ <i>Though</i>
<i>you may not drive</i> §
§<i>A great big Cadillac</i> §
Here, let me
test this out for you,

that maybe it's not...

Yeah.
It's good.
<i>Buddy: I don't know. </i>
<i>What do you think? </i>
Can you handle it?
- Hey!
- Got it!
You got it.
Very nice.
Ohh...
Forget it.
We don't want to go
on this dumb ride
anyway.
We want snow cones
down at the bottom.

What is this?
Oh, come on, just do it.
We'll tell you later.

<i>Joey: Ha ha! </i>
You can
open your eyes now.
<i>Joey: </i>
<i>OK, now read it. </i>
<i>We couldn't decide</i>
<i>on a name, </i>
<i>so it's up to you. </i>
Uh, Darth.
Yes! That was mine.
That was mine.
It was
my second choice, OK?
The boys don't think
you should have
the same name
as the dog.
Oh.
That's good, because
that's a good name for him...
Darth... because
the dog's black,
and he kind of
looks like Vader.
No. That's
<i>your</i> new name.
[Laughter]
Hey, seat belts,
please.
Hey, what are you
doing tomorrow?
You tell me.
There's just something
that I wanted to tell you
which is sort of
hard to say,
<i>Buddy: so I wanted</i>
<i>to just tell you now</i>
that I was going
to tell you, so that...
tomorrow
you'd hold me to it.
[Sighs]
You know,
it's probably nothing.
It's not a...
you know...
<i>Buddy: It's just something</i>
<i>I want to tell you. </i>
Then tell me now.
No, I'll tell you tomorrow.
It's, you know...
I mean...
You just got
to make me tell you.
Oh, great. Well,
this'll be a fun 24 hours.
It's nothing.
Relax. It's fưne.
You know.
All right.
Well, whatever it is,
thank you for today.
It's the least I could do.
Can I help you?
Hi.
Hi.
Are you... Are you
Mrs. Janello?
<i>Abby: Yes. </i>
Now that I'm here,
I wish I'd just mailed this.
Hi. I'm Mimi Prager.
Hello.
Here.
Would you like
to come in?
<i>Mimi: And I hadn't</i>
<i>looked at it since then, </i>
<i>but I</i>... <i>I was looking up</i>
<i>this speech I'd given, </i>
<i>and there it was. </i>
I remembered the review
for his play
was in
the Chicago papers,
so I checked
their archives, and...
You probably don't even
want to see it.
You know, I just...
I thought
since I had
this business trip...
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
He seemed like
a very nice man.
Woman:
Oh! Uncultured creatures!
Hey, Joey, Scott.
Hi, Mr. Amaral.
Uhh.
What's going on?
Shh.
Where's your mom?
She's in the bathroom.
She's been in
since <i>Rosie. </i>
Boy.
Who was on <i>Rosie? </i>
I don't know.
Abby?
Abby?
You all right?
<i>Abby: I'll be out</i>
<i>in a minute. </i>
OK.
[TV On]
Joey: Give me that!
<i>Buddy: </i>
<i>Guys. Hey, Scott. </i>
Hey. Hey, stop,
Joey, Scott.
Joey, Scott, your mom's
trying to relax, OK?
Relax. Watch TV.
Buddy: What do you
want to watch?
Scott: I want
to watch my video.
Buddy:
All right, great.
Aah!
Scott. Scott.
Scott, stop it.
Scott, don't hit
your brother, OK?
He bit me.
Well, he's younger
than you.
Joey.
Joey, apologize, all right?
Say you're sorry.
Can you do that?
Can you do that for me?
Say you're sorry.
That's Dad.

<i>the critic</i>
<i>for the</i> Chicago...
- [Turns OffTV]
- <i>Joey: Hey, That's my dad. </i>
<i>I want</i>
<i>to see that. </i>
<i>Scott: You knew him? </i>
When was that taken?
Uh...
Boys...
<i>Abby: go to your room</i>
<i>until I call you. </i>
But that was dad.
Scott...
please.
Who gave this to you?
Mimi.
Mimi Prager.
<i>Abby: Remember her? </i>
Abby.
Buddy: Abby, I said I was
going to tell you something.
Remember I said I had
something to tell you?
That's what I was
going to tell you.
That's a lie.
Another lie.
He took my place,
and I felt responsible,
and I wanted to make sure
you were OK...
you and your kids.
Who the hell
do you think you are?
God?
Some goddamn angel
come to make sure
the victims
are alive and well?
You lied to me.
I never expected
to fall in love with you.
Oh, my God.
You're a liar.
No. You know
that's true.
I want you
out of this house.
I don't want
to see you again.
I don't want you
to call.
I don't want
to hear your voice
on my machine.
Look, you have
to let me explain.
You son of a bitch.
You lied to me.
Get out.
<i>Scott: </i>
<i>What's wrong, Mom? </i>
[Abby Sighs]
<i>Abby: Do you want me</i>
<i>to say what you did</i>
<i>in front of them? </i>
Because I will do
almost anything
to get you
out of here.
You better go, Mr. Amaral.
Uh...
Yeah, I think so,
too, Scott.
I think you're right.
I'm going to go.
I'll call you.
Joey...
<i>Abby: </i>
<i>come out here. </i>
<i>I want you to say</i>
<i>good</i>-<i>bye to them. </i>
I don't want another guy
<i>Abby: just disappearing</i>
<i>from their lives. </i>
Abby, please.
Mr. Amaral won't be
coming around anymore.
Abby...
You can leave,
or you can say good-bye
and leave.
[Sniffles]
Uh...
I got to go away
for a while.
Why?
Because I...
I kept a secret
from your mom.
You're not supposed
to tell a secret.
Well, then
it wasn't a secret.
It was just...
I just didn't want
to tell her.
Didn't you say
you're sorry?
I <i>am</i> sorry.
<i>Scott: Don't worry</i>
<i>about it, Joey. </i>
Come on.
Come on.
[Sighs]
OK. You have
to let me call you.
Get out...
before I tell them
who you are.

[Beep]
Hey, Scott.
Uh, she's not home,
and even if she was...
She doesn't want
to see me.
Nope.
You know, Scott,
I'd understand it
if you were pretty mad
at me, too.
It's OK.
All right, pal.
I'll see you.
Did he say anything
about Christmas trees?
What?
<i>Scott: My dad. </i>
He was supposed to sell
Christmas trees
with me
the next day,
and maybe that was why
he got back on the plane
and he did
and it crashed, so...
I was just wondering
if he said anything
about that.
Well...
Nah. He didn't
mention that to me.
He just said,
you know, he...
he said he just
wanted to get home.
Everybody at the airport
kind of wants to get home,
that's all.
Yeah, because
he didn't need
to sell those trees
with me.
I didn't even want to.
Everyone
has fake ones anyway.
Yeah, no, he just... he said
he wanted to get home to work.
I remember him saying
something about work,
but nothing about trees.
I'm sure of that.
Do you think
I should tell my mom?
Because...
maybe she thinks it's
because she yelled at him
over the tree thing.
You know, Scott,
I don't think
your mom will believe me.
But you believe me, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's good.
<i>Donna: Could you</i>
<i>help me with these? </i>
Donna, he should've
told me.
Of course. Lying
like that is terrible.
It's like telling people
you're divorced when you're not
or that you found a property
for your biggest client
on you're own
without help.
[Sighs]
Look, he just wanted
to see if you guys were OK.
Yes, but then he should've
left us alone.
Yeah.
I keep forgetting.
Who bought who
the Dodger tickets?
Look, guys screw up.
That's what they do.
It's in their manual
right after
" Love your grill,"
" Leave socks on floor."
[Sighs]
But if you can't
forgive him,
you can't.
It's not that I can't
forgive him.
Do you know how I spent
the night after he left?
Trying to fưgure out
if I was glad that he didn't
get on that plane.
If I say I'm glad
he's alive,
I'm glad he found me
that day,
or if I lie,
and I say I'm not,
either way,
it feels like
I'm doing something
wrong to someone I...
To both of them...
to him and Greg.
Being with him is like
making a choice.
You don't have
that choice, Abby.
You have other choices.
It just can't be him,
that's all.
<i>Donna: </i>
<i>OK, then, fine, </i>
<i>but whether it's Buddy</i>
or someone else
a year from now,
whoever you choose
will be there
because Greg isn't.
That's just how it is.
Hey, Jim.
Seth said
you wanted to see me.
How's it going, Frank?
What's up?
<i>Buddy: Are we being sued</i>
<i>or something? </i>
Infưnity Airlines, according
to its marketing V.P.,
is deciding today
whether our services
will be required
in the future.
What? Why?
Apparently,
they've received
some information
that you coerced
an Infưnity employee
to illegally board
a passenger
<i>Frank: under your name</i>
<i>onto flight 82.</i>
Yeah. I mean, we dealt
with this a year ago
after the crash.
It was a computer problem
or something.
They have a correct version
of the roster
in their system.
Yes, they do.
Uh, you know
a Janice Guerrero?
<i>Frank: She was fired</i>
<i>6 weeks after the accident</i>
<i>for altering</i>
<i>the roster</i>...
removing your name,
in fact,
and adding the name
of a Greg...
What does this
have to do
with our situation
with Infưnity?
The suit is being
brought against Infưnity
by the victims'
families.
<i>Jim: </i>
<i>They want to prove</i>
<i>that the airline didn't</i>
<i>follow procedures</i>...
<i>even technicalities</i>...
<i>So Infinity</i>
<i>wants to make sure</i>
that if you get called
to testify
that you'll tell the court
what you told us today...
that you did not persuade
this gate attendant
<i>Jim: </i>
<i>to board someone else. </i>
Is this woman
going to testify?
<i>Frank: Maybe... </i>
but she's not the most
credible witness.
She's a bitter
ex-employee,
ax to grind.
Infưnity's position
is that
the roster screwup
is a harmless
computer glitch.
It's no big deal.
They just want to know if
you have a problem with that.

<i>Mandel: </i>
<i>Mr. Amaral. </i>
<i>Buddy: Yes. </i>
<i>Mandel: </i>
<i>You were scheduled</i>
<i>to be a passenger</i>
<i>on flight 82,</i>
<i>were you not? </i>
<i>Buddy: </i>
<i>Yes, that's right. </i>
In fact, when the plane
went down,
your name
was on the fưrst list
of passengers,
was it not?
That is correct.
But, instead,
a Mr. Greg Janello
was in your seat,
isn't that correct?
I believe so, yes.
You believe so?
Uh...
Yes.
He was in my seat.
Do you know
how Mr. Janello
happened to be
on that plane
occupying your seat?
No. I don't know.
Excuse me?
I'm... I'm... I'm
just very confused
about a lot of things
that happened that night.
Well, you're not
confused
about having
just taken an oath
to tell the truth,
are you?
<i>Defense Lawyer: </i>
<i>Objection, Your Honor. </i>
Mandel: I'll rephrase,
Your Honor.
Mr. Amaral,
did you have
a conversation that night
with Mr. Janello?
Mr. Mandel, I had
a lot of conversations
<i>Buddy: </i>
<i>with a lot of people. </i>
<i>You know, everything</i>
<i>was delayed, </i>
and I... I...
I don't remember every...
This is Mr. Janello.
Did you have a conversation
with this man?
Yes, I did.
<i>Mandel: </i>
<i>And did you offer</i>
<i>to switch boarding</i>
<i>passes with him? </i>
No, I did not.
<i>Mandel: No? </i>
I just gave him mine.
I didn't take his.
<i>Mandel: And when</i>
<i>Miss Guerrero</i>
<i>recognized you</i>
<i>at the gate? </i>
Yeah, I talked her
into it.
By telling her
if they didn't board you
<i>Mandel: or someone</i>
<i>claiming to be you, </i>
<i>they'd have to wait while</i>
<i>they took your luggage</i>
<i>out of the hold. </i>
Basically, yeah.
Are you aware
that airlines
<i>Mandel: have to deplane</i>
<i>the luggage</i>
<i>of passengers who don't</i>
<i>make the flight</i>
<i>as an antiterrorism</i>
<i>measure? </i>
Yes. It's so
that somebody
doesn't check a bomb
and then not
get on the plane.
<i>Mandel: Mm</i>-<i>hmm. </i>
<i>So this employee</i>
<i>of Infinity</i>
<i>Mandel: disregarded</i>
<i>a safety measure</i>
<i>due to her desire</i>
<i>to make the schedule. </i>
Objection.
Argumentative.
<i>Judge: Sustained. </i>
You know, she was just
trying to do me a favor.
It wasn't...
<i>Mandel: No one's</i>
<i>blaming you, Mr. Amaral. </i>
<i>It wasn't yourjob</i>
<i>to make sure</i>
<i>the airline followed</i>

<i>now, was it? </i>
He was scared.
<i>Mandel: </i>

He had a wife now
and 2 kids.
2 boys.
<i>Buddy: </i>
<i>And he knew that... </i>
<i>if something happened</i>
<i>to him, </i>
<i>if he didn't come home, </i>
<i>that wasn't something</i>
<i>that anybody</i>
<i>could make up for. </i>
If... lf you tried, I mean.
Only somebody who...
Only somebody who didn't
understand anything
would try.
[Buddy Sighs]
<i>Buddy: But I didn't</i>
<i>know that then. </i>
I just thought...
here.
It's a ticket.
It's free.
Take it.
You'll be fưne.
And he did.
And he died.
And that's what
I got to carry.
<i>Buddy: I'd just like</i>
<i>to say that I'm sorry. </i>
<i>Judge: You're excused, </i>
<i>Mr. Amaral. </i>
Am I?
Excused?
[Sighs]
<i>Newscaster: </i>
<i>Infinity Airlines today</i>
<i>settled the last</i>
<i>of the lawsuits</i>
<i>that have gone to trial</i>
<i>as a result</i>
<i>of the 1999 crash</i>
<i>in Kansas</i>
<i>in which the 216 people</i>
<i>aboard flight 82</i>
<i>Iost their lives. </i>
Hey, Seth.
<i>Seth: Hey. </i>
Word is you pretty much
single-handedly
sank Infưnity.
Yeah.
I noticed a chill
on the way in.
Yeah?
Well, bundle up.
UncleJim
wants to see you.
Could you do me a favor and
type this up for me, please?
Mm-hmm.
[Inaudible]
<i>Seth: I thought</i>
<i>Jim's speech was nice. </i>
<i>Buddy: Yeah, but</i>
<i>everyone else. Whoo! </i>
<i>Seth: I know. I don't</i>
<i>think I've ever been</i>
to a farewell party
where the theme was relief.
Well, I like
to leave a place
happier than
when I found it.
They were happy,
all right.
I was dodging cartwheels
all afternoon.
So, are you going
to fưnd a new job,
or are you going to
go out on your own?
I stole you plenty
of offưce supplies.
Yeah.
I don't know.
I'm kind of all sold out,
you know what I mean?
I told Jim you can
handle the transition.
He said he was going
to move you
into account traffưc.
He came up with that
all on his own?
Roughly.
Means you get
your own assistant.
Is this you asking me
for the job?
[Laughs]
You want to catch
an A.A. meeting tonight?
Yeah.
Uh, there's the one...
Hey.
Hey.
Uh...
I... I need
to get back to work
and take down the
"Good Riddance" banners.
<i>Seth: We love</i>
<i>the new building</i>...
lots of space.
Even more after today.
I resigned...
about 3 minutes before
Jim was going to fưre me.
You're moving.
Yeah.
I can't afford
this place anymore.
How are the boys?
They're good.
Scott told me that
you came to see him,
and he told me
what you said.
Well...
it wasn't Scott's fault.
Or yours.
Or even mine,
which is something
that I thought
for a really long time.
And you really
helped me see that,
and I wanted
to tell you, so...
Can you just stay for,
like, a few more minutes?
Please?
You know what Greg said
that last night
he called?
That he had met
some really nice people
in the bar.
And I think
he was right.
Abby, wait.
What?
[Sighs]
Should I sell this place
right away or...
lease it out
until the market peaks?
I'm hoping you could
help me handle that.
Why me? I mean...
I really don't have
the experience.
Yes, you do.
Can we try?
I know
you're scared, Abby.
I am, too.
It's not brave
if you're not scared.
You'd better not be
waiting for me
to kick in
any commission.
[Laughs]
Deal.
Come on. I'll show you
how it looks
from the beach, OK?
[Laughs]
