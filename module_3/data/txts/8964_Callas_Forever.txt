- Where are they?
- Where's who?
- Bad Dreams.
- Probably still in bed.
- Not on the same flight?
- We announced I'd arrive alone.
- We thought that meant
you weren't. - So we fooled you!
- Why do you take the band
to Paris? - Paris loves stars.
Mistinguette, Piaf, Chevalier...
- Piaf didn't urinate on the crowd.
- That's not what I heard.
- Chevalier didn't flash his arse.
- Please!
- Aren't Bad Dreams a comedown?
- What do you mean?
You've presented Nureyev,
Fonteyn, Menuhin, Callas...
Bob Dylan and the Stones.
Don't be boring, it's 1977,
kids want groups like this today.
- Will you see Callas in Paris?
- Maybe.
- You produced her last tour
to Japan, didn't you? -Yeah.
- It was a disaster!
- The Titanic was a disaster.
We're not here to talk about
Maria Callas, but Bad Dreams.
I hope you'll come
to their concert on Wednesday.
- Until tomorrow, at the Gare du
Nord! -They're coming by train?
Yes, the airlines won't take them.
Thank you.
Do you ever tire of all that?
- All what?
- All that bullshit.
Publicity is never bullshit.
- You're buzzing.
- Am I?
It's this.
I've never seen
a good-looking guy with one.
Sorry, I can't hear you flirting.
- Larry Kelly.
- I know.
- Sorry, I'm late. - Don't worry,
we've dealt with the press.
How was the flight?
Fine.
- How are the tickets doing?
- Sold out! - Good!
- What are the problems?
- Faulty wiring at the stadium.
Call Philip Pope in London,
he fixed Wembley in 10 minutes.
I can hear you from here.
- What?
- I can hear your thing.
Bullshit.
Don't you hate big cars?
Depends what happens in them.
- Fancy a lift?
- Why not?
I offered to carry your bags, but
you didn't mention six flights!
Didn't I?
- Is this your work?
- Yes.
I'm part of a group show
next week,
and then I think I have my own show
in Tel Aviv.
Then maybe Capetown,
where I was born.
- Are you impressed?
- Give me time...
- Maria! - I need her voice
whenever I come home. - Oh, God!
- You're not one of those ghastly
Callas queens, are you? - Hardly.
I'm too young to have seen
her perform... unfortunately.
Unfortunately.
When I had my operation
to try to restore my hearing,
my mother sneaked a... cassette
player into the hospital room.
So that the first sound
I would hear
would be...
I don't know...
unearthly.
Beauty not of this earth,
Callas.
- Will you do other concerts?
- No.
Her voice is shot.
I do have plans though.
I've got to go.
- Can I give you my card?
- No. - Ok.
How about dinner tomorrow?
- You mean a date?
- Are you too modern for that?
I'll pick you up at 9:00.
8:00.
Alright, 8:00.
But I'll be late.
There's nothing coming out
of number nine!
Number nine is dead completely,
it's crackling.
Will you make coffee?
- Just a minute.
- The click track?
- They'll use earphones as usual.
- The backing track?
- Cheating, are we? - Sarah!
- Wasn't it supposed to be live?
Don't wind me up, every group
does it! What're you doing here?
- Doing an article on Wet Dreams.
- Bad Dreams!
- Did I ok this?
- You did!
I'm surprised
your rag's interested.
Their music is appalling, but
their arrest record is fantastic!
The kids love them,
and they earn a fortune.
Aren't you a bit long in the tooth
for a punk band?
You're not a teenybopper either!
- Are they for me?
- She wouldn't take them. - What?
Her maid noticed they were from you
and sent them back.
This is your friend!
She said Madame Callas
is sailing in the Greek islands.
She hasn't been there
since Onassis died!
She cancelled four lunches
with me.
Haven't seen her in months,
friendship isn't in her repertoire.
- D'you have a light?
- Brendan, give her a light.
Why are you so upset
about an old has been?
- Don't you dare say that!
- Your arm! - Right.
I thought only musicians did that.
- Did what? - Shot up backstage!
- It's vitamins.
Get her on the phone.
We'll throw the flowers
on the stage after the show.
Is that Bruna?
Bruna, it's Larry.
Pass me Madame Callas.
I just want... Don't...
Shit!
A has-been?
- Did you ever hear her?
- She was before my time.
- Why do I always hire children?
- That question has been asked!
- This proves my point.
- What point?
- Point of my idea. - What idea?
- I'm not going to tell you!
A has-been...
The greatest opera singer!
I could fire you,
I think I will, you're fired!
You're right. Forget the flowers,
forget the phone, I'll go see her.
- Did I say that?
- No, but you thought it!
- Mr. Larry! - Bruna,
tell Madame I've come to call.
- Madame is not in.
- Yes, she is in. I know it. - No.
- You're lying! - No, I'm not.
Where are you going? - Maria!
Bruna, who is it?
Why do you want to come in?
Mr. Larry!
I'm out for anybody.
Who do you think you are?
How dare you push your way in?
I've looked for you for days!
Ferruccio,
see this gentleman out, please.
- I just want to speak to you.
- Mind leaving?
- I want to speak to Madame Callas.
- Madame doesn't want... - Please.
Let go of him.
- Sorry, you're alright, you'll
live. - Well, well, violence...
When a lady says she's not at home,
she's not at home.
- But you are at home!
- It's a manner of speaking!
Well, in a manner of speaking,
I was passing by.
Nobody passes by Maria Callas.
Either they come to see me
or they don't.
- What do you want?
- To say hello.
Ok. Hello.
Now goodbye!
I want to talk to you.
Another proposal?
After Japan?
Japan wasn't my idea.
- Whose idea was it then? Mine?
- Yes, as a matter of fact.
The genesis, so to speak
of an idea, is immaterial.
It happened.
Japan happened.
That's enough!
There, Japan.
I keep it to remind me.
- Of what?
- Never to set foot on stage again.
No matter what you thought
of your voice that night,
the audience still loved you.
People wouldn't notice
if I barked!
Which I almost did that night!
So? You've come to suggest another
way to make a fool of myself?
Want me to join a Chinese circus
or show my derriere in public?
- I do read the papers!
- That's just show business.
What I'm suggesting is serious,
it's revolutionary!
It's too late,
I'm no longer on the market.
Let's talk about something else.
Tell me about yourself.
- When did you become a hippy?
- Don't play around!
- You look tired. - I'm fine.
- Do you eat enough? -Yes!
- Does anyone take care of you?
- I don't need that!
- You need a proper boyfriend.
- Well...
- Have you met someone?
- Maybe.
Thank God, gossip!
I want details!
- I thought you wanted me
to leave? - I do, but later.
- Some tea for Mr. Kelly, please.
- Yes!
- It turned out he was an artist,
a painter. - What's his name?
I don't know.
- He's hearing impaired.
- What do you mean?
He doesn't hear very well,
he's a little deaf.
- He doesn't have to listen to you.
- He has all your records!
- Can he hear them? -Yes,
he wears a thing. - You mean...
No, a little thing that sits
in there, you can't see it.
He'd better be attractive. Is he?
Good.
What are they doing up there?
- You practicing?
- Practicing for what?
Singing, this piano's out of tune.
I told you
I don't want to sing again.
- You're deaf like your friend?
- Maria! Want to just vegetate?
The new generation
has never seen you!
- They've missed their chance.
- Give them a second chance.
Don't speak to me
about a second chance!
- Did Icarus have one?
- No, but...
No, he flew too close to the sun
and pow, into the water!
If he had artificial wings?
- What do you mean?
- The world is changing.
We have to change with it,
there are new technologies.
"Callas Forever", what a title!
I want to film you singing
your most famous roles
and match it to your old recordings
when your voice was in its prime.
Technically, it's possible. I've
laid it all out. Do me a favour.
Take it to bed tonight, read it,
and tell me what you think.
I know what it is,
I know why you look different.
- You dye your hair!
- Don't change...
"Callas Forever"...
There is no Callas!
- Jesus Christ!
- I denounce Maria Callas!
Let me alone, I have many things
to do. I'm on holiday.
I leave tomorrow for Sicily
and then the Greek Islands.
Bruna, is the luggage ready?
In a few months, I'm to visit
Egypt, to see the Pyramids again.
Don't forget anything!
What are you waiting for?
You still think there's money
to be made off of me?
I don't entertain leeches.
I don't know why I am here,
the band opens tomorrow.
They may eat chicken heads on
stage, but they're professional.
- They piss on the audience!
- Come on, Maria!
I haven't seen you in ages,
but you haven't changed one jot.
You're still a stupid,
stubborn cow!
- How dare you say that?
Get out! -Alright.
Don't set foot in my house again!
- Don't worry!
- Do you hear me?
I don't want to see you no more!
- Bad Dreams want ice cream flown
in from America. - Go and get it.
- Where do we send it?
- What d'you mean?
They've been thrown out of the
Ritz, they've wrecked four suites.
Good for them!
Rockstars are easy compared
with divas, they're easy!
Hello!
Maria!
- Some wine?
- Lovely.
- How's your omelette?
- Good.
Didn't expect to eat alone,
I thought we'd go out.
I don't go out,
out is over-rated.
What about fresh air, sunshine?
This is Paris, the most beautiful
city in the world!
What's a city?
Just a place, not home.
This is your home,
you've been here for 20 years!
I don't have a home.
I lived in Italy many years
as well. And Greece, America.
Do you think I've ever been
attached to a place, a country?
I don't speak correctly
any language,
I don't know who I am.
I was born Maria Kalogeropoulou
and now I'm Maria Callas.
I'm neither one.
ljust float.
A very interesting rendition
of Chekhov, thank you.
Why not float over here,
sit down, and have some food?
- I'm not interested in food.
- What was that for?
Something or other,
does it matter?
There hasn't been a reason...
not a single reason...
to leave this house since he died.
I need a better frame for this.
- Beautiful, isn't he?
- Onassis?
Were you wearing glasses
when you looked at him?
I saw the beauty, she didn't!
Mrs Kennedy...
- She never understood him.
- You never understood him either.
He was a shit, you know it.
Turned you into a slave
on that stupid boat.
Just lying in the sun,
no piano, no practicing...
Losing your voice
and all your friends.
Let's not argue,
I don't have the energy.
- Sarah! I'm naked!
- I have to talk to you.
- Don't reporters knock?
- No, never. - What do you want?
- Just five minutes. - Later,
if it's about last night's concert.
- They were great, right?
- If you like self-mutilation.
- This is serious.
- A massage is serious.
Maria needs your help.
This is private.
You've got something to say,
say it!
The feet, please.
You've got no idea how tense I am.
- We have to get her out of that
apartment. - So, hire a forklift.
Bruna tells me she's up all night,
listening to her recordings
and taking pills.
- God knows what they are!
D'you have a lighter? - Please!
- Sorry. I saw what you sent,
I read your proposal.
- What? - It's a marvellous idea.
It could give her back her life.
- You tell her that, not me!
- Listen to me.
She doesn't eat,
she's wasting away.
She's in mourning for her voice,
for her career, for Onassis.
It's like the last act of one
of her operas and she's only 53!
- You have to help her!
- I'm not a good Samaritan.
- Don't you care
what happens to her? - No.
Jesus, Sarah!
- What was that for?
- For lying!
If you can't sleep,
you should phone her.
<- Hello.
- Sarah.
Is it two o'clock?
I'm sorry.
Listen...
Where does she get the pills?
Who gives them to her?
Alright. Alright...
I'll talk to Bruna
when I get back from Hamburg.
<- Good night.
- I'm sorry.
I woke her up.
She was not pleased.
Mr. Larry, please, leave.
Madame. Madame. Stop it.
Go to bed.
Don't cry.
- What do you want?
- One espresso.
- Here you are. Sugar.
- Thank you.
Good morning!
- What are you doing here?
- I've made some breakfast.
- With help from Bruna. Up a daisy,
it's two o'clock. - Bruna!
It's a beautiful day, the sun's
shining, the birds are singing.
You can't spend
all your time in bed.
Go on!
Drink your coffee.
Better now?
Your friends
are very worried about you.
You do know you have friends,
don't you?
Have you ever trusted anybody else,
I mean really trusted?
If you have,
I want you to trust me today.
No questions, just trust me.
I beg you!
I actually beg you.
Think about it,
finish your breakfast.
I want to see Maria Callas again.
Afternoon, Madame Callas.
We're going in here.
- Sarah!
- Maria! - Oh, my God!
Gerard, I'm suspicious
if my record company is present.
- You are gorgeous!
- You are too kind!
- What is this? -A conspiracy!
- Come and sit down, Maria.
- We have a surprise.
- Asurprise?!
- Would you like a cup of coffee?
- No, thank you. - And you? -Yes.
Roll the film.
- Is this a joke?
- There's a problem with the sound.
What's wrong with the sound?
You invaded my house,
virtually kidnapped me
to bring me here to watch
my most shameful performance!
- How could you?
- You're wrong.
When they fix the sound, you'll
see you've never sounded better.
You're mad!
- It was a mistake.
- Sit down.
Go again.
I told you so,
you'd never been in better voice.
I was in terrible voice!
What have you done?
What kind of trick is it?
This is your Japanese concert,
but the sound comes from
a recording you made 22 years ago.
We've married the sound
to the picture. It's simple.
- But it's dishonest!
- Why?
It's not me singing!
Then who is it? Renata Tebaldi?
No, it's your image,
it's your voice,
it has to be you!
I'm very confused.
Am I selling my soul to Satan?
This is 1977, Satan is redundant.
Anyway, in theory,
he can make you live forever.
Vampires live forever.
- If anyone qualifies as a vampire,
it's me. - Why did you say that?
I'm a journalist, remember?
We suck blood.
Because, of course, we can't sing,
or dance, or paint...
I'd give anything
to be Maria Callas!
You are and you don't want to be.
They came last night.
My phantoms,
Medea, Violetta, Norma...
But one in particular
is haunting me.
Who?
Carmen.
I never sang her on stage.
I only recorded her.
I never completed her.
And maybe...
- Maybe...
- No, it's too crazy.
- Maybe Carmen
could be the exception. - No.
It would be fresh,
I wouldn't be dredging up the past.
- Perhaps it could work.
- Perhaps? -Yes, perhaps.
Maria, no more "perhaps",
I need a "yes"!
It's not a hard word to say!
You can form the words.
Please!
Alright.
- Yes.
- You sure?
Well, I...
Yes.
I have your guarantee?
Yes.
It's the most beautiful "yes"
in the world!
And you're the most beautiful
woman in the world!
The first film that we propose
is a role Madame Callas
has never performed on stage.
It's also one of the most popular
operas in the world:
"Carmen".
I've spoken to the distinguished
Spanish film maker, Esteban Gomez,
who is very keen to direct.
- And is Callas really committed?
- "Carmen" is her idea.
- She always reneges on contracts!
- Peter, come on!
I've known and worked
with Maria Callas for many years.
She's a consummate artist,
her record of honouring her
commitments is better than many.
Nevertheless,
we're gonna need some guarantees.
I'm your guarantee.
She is my guarantee.
I've never put up money
into my own projects,
but since I'm so convinced
of the importance
and good investment
of this project,
I am putting up 50%
of the initial capital.
What we're offering is involvement
in one of the greatest cultural
events of the 20th century.
Maria Callas on film,
the greatest opera star
singing her greatest roles.
These films could open up
a new generation to her work.
After "Carmen",
we'll film her other great roles,
"La Traviata", "Norma", "Tosca".
With the emergence of the new
market in video cassette-players
not only will sales of her
records go through the roof,
but sales of her videos.
Royalties from those
will keep us warm in our old age.
It'll be alright.
- There he is!
- Maria, you look wonderful.
You didn't tell me
the press would be here!
- I tried to avoid this.
- Either they go or I go!
I can't ask them to leave, you'll
have to speak to them at some time.
You can handle them.
Madame Callas has nothing to say.
- Are you returning to the stage?
- Maybe.
- Why did you change your mind?
- Because I'm a woman.
Are you gonna make a movie?
Please, don't push!
When are you going
to sing again at the Scala?
When your audience
will be more polite.
- How much money are you getting?
- Use your mind a bit.
(SPEAK GREEK)
- Are you going to perform
Isolde? - I'm not fat enough.
Do you get a percentage
of the profits?
I'm not supposed to tell you.
You haven't come to terms yet
about my percentage, have you?
I'm glad they reminded me. You must
always have the press around.
- From the top of "Habanera".
- Everything satisfactory? -Yes.
I'm sorry.
- I must know where I took
a breath. - It's very simple.
Show me!
- I'll do my best. - Once more!
- Could you remove your necklace?
- Yes.
- Thank you. - Nothing.
- I'm ready.
- Thank you.
Yes, it works!
Beautiful!
This is very difficult.
I have to sing along to the tape,
I can't just move my lips, right?
Yes.
The vocal cords, neck muscles, the
diaphragm... everything is singing.
Exactly.
Which means when we cast
Escamillo and Don Jose,
they must be able to sing, even
if we won't hear their voices.
Am I correct?
But first we must find actors
who have the right look,
beautiful actors...
- When can we start seeing people?
- Tomorrow at noon.
I'll be there.
Beautiful voice, interesting.
If he can match...
- Eugene, think there's a problem
with the match? - He'll be fine.
Ok.
Music and action!
- Studio.
<- It's Michael. Is Larry there?
Not yet.
Hang on, he's just arriving.
Arrested?
I'll call the Minister.
- Who is it?
- The painter.
It's a madhouse here,
I just got in from Florence.
Just post bail. I can't hear you.
Forget it, he's just the drummer.
Why don't you come?
<I didn't forget, I just didn't
<know how to get in touch.
<Jump in a taxi.
I can't hear, see you later.
Big kiss.
- The shawl is too small!
- What the hell's going on?
What the hell's going on?
I have no wig!
- She doesn't need a wig.
- How can I rehearse like this?
You look wonderful. You're nervous
'cause it's the first big scene.
- I'm terrified!
- Why?
The men of Sevilla are waiting
for Carmen, desiring her.
- How can I fulfil that at my age?
- You're ageless!
A nice word for "decrepit"?
You're saying a mature person
can't attract a young man?
- The Minister is waiting.
- Are you?
I've got an extraordinary idea,
in this scene, I'll put Escamillo!
- What? - He's Spain's greatest
matador and he wants Carmen.
Bizet didn't think of that!
Let's try it!
Come on!
- I'm looking for Larry.
- He's not here.
- Know where he is?
- In a meeting.
So what else is new?
Now comes the moment of destiny,
Carmen sees Don Jose
for the first time.
Where is he?
There!
Even more handsome
in a soldier's uniform.
He's the only man in Sevilla
who ignores her.
She's attracted by that?
Yes, the danger of it,
like in a bullfight,
the bravery of the matador
is almost a dance with death.
You try now.
It's very important
to keep your shoulders back.
Keep your back straight,
hold your stomach.
Everybody's looking at you.
Alright?
Keep this position,
but holding your skirt.
Don't bend on your knees.
Let's go!
Perfect!
Start with the right, one and two.
Hold your head up!
Keep your shoulders down,
mind your arms.
You must look as if you had
just seen the man of your life.
Conquer him!
Move your skirt!
Look at her eyes, she's loving it!
Hold it, that's not right!
Once again! Music!
She's in good form!
I don't know when I can do that...
Wonderful! Beautiful!
That was great, but now
we are going to take a rest.
- Take a rest? -We have union
rules, we must stop!
I don't care about the rules!
- I'll call you back.
- I don't tolerate laziness!
If you want
to work with Maria Callas,
you must be ready to work
day and night, understand?
I don't care about Maria Callas!
I can't be surrounded
by people with stopwatches!
Every move I make must be perfect!
If I can't be a perfect gypsy,
I will not go on.
I didn't realise
this was an amateur production.
Go back to your Bad Dreams!
I should have known this was
a third rate operation.
- You ungrateful bitch!
- You tacky, stupid producer!
Shyster, son of a bitch!
I've missed it!
A good tantrum!
I've been so bored.
I'm exhausted.
No, I'm not,
I'd like to do something.
Let's go out, we never do.
What about a dinner?
- You're not free? - Could
I bring Michael? - Michael?
- My friend.
- Now you know his name!
It must be serious!
- He's dying to meet you.
- I'd like to meet him.
- I'll be ready in 5 minutes.
- Put on something...
Chanel!
My God!
It's exactly
like the first act of "Boheme"!
Your paintings...
Wonderful red!
I adore red!
It's beautiful.
- It's you.
- What?
It's what I feel when I hear you.
I feel colours, vibrations...
sound waves woven into the air.
He's very good this boy!
I want to show you
something special.
This is my favourite,
"Norma".
The splendour of the moon
with that incredible music
of "Casta Diva"...
a feeling of peace and serenity.
Sometimes...
I have visions inside my head.
You've read my heart.
Bad Dreams don't want to go
to Korea because they eat dogs?
They're a rock band, not gourmets!
I can't be bothered
with them anymore.
I'm trying to edit a film,
I've got a nervous leading lady.
I can't wait to see it!
It's just a rough cut.
We just finished it.
- This morning? -Yeah.
- Right. - Go on.
It's spectacular,
looks like something out of MGM!
It's a real gipsy atmosphere,
that's why I brought gipsies
from Spain.
- Where's Carmen?
- Now she's coming.
Here she comes!
I love that red shawl.
- Red's your favourite color.
- Yes. - Very sexy.
Bravo!
Bravo, Esteban!
Thank you so much!
She dances like a Spanish!
Lucia told me, gipsies dance
to relieve their tension.
- Carmen is very tense.
- Exactly.
Because she doesn't know
if Don Jose will come or not.
She asks the cards,
the cards never lie.
My God!
- Perfect sync! What's his real
voice like? -Very good.
- Who's he studied with?
- Michelangelo.
- Shut up!
- Sorry.
Who is?
- It's Marco.
- Marco!
I just wanted to thank you.
What for?
They're beautiful!
My favourite color.
- Please sit down.
- Thank you.
Bruna, will you go fetch a vase?
- I'm out for anybody.
- Ok.
I want to speak with Marco.
Please, sit down.
May I ask you a question?
Of course.
Do you think I'll be able
to sing Jose,
one day, with my own voice?
- In an opera house?
- Yes, it's very possible.
Your voice has a beautiful quality.
If you study well
and watch your breathing,
if you remember
what I showed you...
- I will never forget.
- Have a drink.
I don't usually drink.
It helps the voice if you relax.
Thank you.
Cheers.
So your parents were upset
when you left?
It's wine country, they've worked
in the vineyards for ages.
They expected you
to stamp on grapes?
I suppose.
But you're meant to stamp
on other things.
You're a handsome man.
You must have a string
of broken hearts lying behind you.
Not that many.
You're meant to break hearts,
it's your destiny!
Tell me about you.
Haven't you left something out?
I don't understand.
Is there someone you haven't
mentioned? Let me guess.
A girlfriend perhaps.
Well, yes.
- I've known her since...
- You were children.
No, teenagers.
I suppose you are faithful?
Because someday you plan
to marry her?
Yes, that's the idea.
That's a long way off.
I'm not ready yet.
So many things have to happen
still in my life,
so many things to experience,
to discover.
I don't know what I'm saying,
I'm not used to the brandy.
Where is Bruna? Bruna!
We have to work together.
At the end of the day,
only work counts.
But, Madame...
It's been a long day.
I'll see you tomorrow.
- You alright?
- It was a triumph, wasn't it?
It was magnificent.
- Atriumph is worse
than a failure. - What?
- If this price is too high.
- What are you on about?
It's like Faust, isn't it?
Faust won back his youth.
So did l, the sound of my youth.
Come on! He's a character
in an opera, he's fictional.
"Carmen" was a fraud!
Yeah, alright!
All performance art is a fraud.
When you gave those great
performances before,
didn't you stand
in front of painted scenery?
Yes, but...
When you played Medea,
when you were deciding
to murder your children,
weren't you looking at a man
with a stick in hand,
conducting an orchestra?
It's all a fake!
- But you gave it its own truth.
The same thing with Carmen. - No!
What does it matter if it's
the young voice if it works?
And it does work!
It's given you a second chance,
take hold of it.
Stop this nonsense! I don't want
to worry about you when I'm gone.
Gone?
I've got to do my column
from New York for six months,
I leave on Wednesday.
Goodbye!
Alright.
I'll miss you.
I'll miss you.
- Oh, you!
- I'll miss you. - Oh, Maria!
You're right.
You don't have to worry about me.
I'm back on...
what is it in English?
- On the trail?
- Track! -Whatever.
- What on earth? - "La Traviata".
- I know! - Our next project?
- Wasn't he to do it last night?
- What are you saying?
- You said he would. - Rocco will
deal with it, he has to sign it.
- Rocco's the man.
- I'll take care of it.
- See you.
- Be back later.
You look good.
Why do we have to meet in the car?
No telephones,
no assistants running around.
- Sounds ominous.
- Why'd she pick him up?
What's the problem?
I can't do "La Traviata".
You changed your mind overnight?
I never promised.
Is there a reason?
You're a professional,
you understand.
I said everything
I have to say about Violetta.
Same is true of Norma,
Lucia, Medea...
Carmen was different.
But forget the others.
Let's stop now.
What'll you do
for the rest of your life?
Rot away
in that stinking apartment?
If I choose, it's my life.
And you've chosen.
Well, thank you.
Stop the car.
I'm getting out.
- Where are you going? -To spend
my time with live people.
- We're in traffic! - I'd rather
get run over than stay here.
Larry, stop!
Perhaps Tosca.
Tosca?
I never had a picnic before.
It's very pleasant.
You can observe people.
Cut to the chase.
What do you mean?
You didn't bring me here
to listen to the birds.
Maria Callas doesn't arrange
a picnic in Bois de Boulogne
unless she wants to soften me up.
What is it?
Are we going to do "Tosca"?
I have so many problems with Tosca.
I did it many times and perhaps...
That was fun while it lasted.
"Tosca" was in production
for two minutes, a record!
Don't waste the sandwich!
That's what this charade's about?
To tell me
you can't do "La Traviata",
but instead "Tosca",
but actually you can't.
I could kill you!
Sit down. Please!
I've been thinking seriously
about singing "Tosca" again.
- Singing?
- I'm only 53.
There are people giving concerts
who are almost 80!
"Carmen" was
a great experience for me.
I found the excitement again of...
making something, creating.
I rediscovered my soul.
I'd given it away,
long before...
In exchange for what?
I've wasted so many good years...
- Maria...
- It's not too late.
Tosca may be the role
I'm still able to perform.
But this time,
without your tricks!
I must be Callas again,
but Callas as she is today.
I understand...
I must work on my voice
and re-explore the character.
Maybe I should do a workshop.
I've changed so much
since I played Tosca...
We'll see if I have the voice.
I want to try.
You think I'm crazy?
No, not crazy.
It just turns my idea on its head.
Be prepared for people to say...
This time
I'm asking you to trust me.
Ok.
No, just a small group.
Students.
People she can bounce off
new ideas.
She's played Tosca
a hundred times before,
she wants to find something new.
It won't cost us anything,
it's a rehearsal.
When she's discovered something,
we'll shoot!
See you there.
Yes! Bye.
It's me.
- I'd kill for a Scotch.
- It's on the side of the bed.
The ice probably melted.
I'm sorry I'm so late.
I spent the day trying
to persuade Philistines
that art's a good investment,
and I succeeded.
So good!
- What are you doing?
- Packing. - Why?
- My show in Tel Aviv is next week.
- Next week?
- I told you four times.
- Yeah, but...
People who hear don't listen.
When do you return?
I don't know. I have shows
in Amsterdam and Capetown as well.
- Places.
- Yeah, but...
Mike!
- Will I see you again?
- Who knows?
Did I fuck up?
<Bear in mind
<that at the end of the second act,
<Tosca kills another human being.
<What brings her to this?
Every time I've played Tosca,
I have, in my mind,
plunged that knife
into a different person,
someone I hated at that moment.
But...
she's still possessed by him.
When she sleeps,
she dreams of him.
When she's awake,
she feels his touch.
How can she break the spell?
Death!
Death can free her.
Only God can judge them both.
Callas will only film "Tosca"
if she can sing in her own voice?
Exactly.
Her voice is unusable,
it's sad but true.
The voice doesn't matter,
the performance matters!
We should film "Tosca"
with Maria as she is today,
with her voice today.
The voice does matter.
There was a voice,
the audience expects to hear that.
- Gerard!
- It's opera!
Opera is voice, opera is music.
There's other kinds of music.
There's the music in the head,
in the heart...
There's unnameable music.
You are all deaf.
Gentlemen, I'm surprised she agreed
to do any of this project.
Let's look at the bright side,
we have the "Carmen" special.
Sales of her records
will go through the roof!
Larry. Your coat.
It doesn't matter
that they didn't understand.
There are other sources,
other backers.
We'll take the project elsewhere.
- We've got to do it!
- They are not wrong.
That's the first thing you must say
to yourself, they are not wrong.
No matter how much
I refine my knowledge,
the truth is, there is no voice.
Does that matter? No!
Yes,
because once there was a voice.
Such a voice!
- You have other things...
- Larry. - Listen, you have...
We have to face the fact
that we are older.
Both of us.
- Have you lost money?
- That doesn't matter.
I'll earn with "Carmen".
What?
What were you going to say?
- Say it.
- I can't. - Come on!
- I have no right.
- Maria, be straight with me!
Destroy "Carmen".
"Carmen"?
You've got no right,
"Carmen" is beautiful!
I know.
Some of the best work
you've ever done.
It's a legacy...
In a hundred years time,
it will be there!
People will say: "There!"
That was Callas!
But, it's not honest.
It's a fake.
A magnificent fake,
but still a fake.
Maybe no one watching will realise,
but I know.
Technology can create
the most extraordinary illusions.
But what I had,
was never an illusion.
If it was nothing else,
it was honest.
Even on a bad night,
when you wanted to close your ears
and hide your eyes,
it was honest!
Now, you're asking me to end
my career by announcing that...
Maria Callas was a fraud?
You want my legacy
to be the opposite
of everything I ever stood for?
I know why I hate integrity.
It's great
for the person who has it,
but pure hell for those around it.
It's admirable.
You know I own half of "Carmen".
I'll make sure
that it's never shown.
What do you want?
My kidneys? My liver?
Thank you.
Take me to my car.
Michael sent this.
Ah, indeed!
Why don't we walk?
I need to walk.
- God answers prayers, you know?
- Does He?
Yes, contrary to popular belief.
The problem is
we ask for the wrong things.
I hated Maria Kalogeropoulou,
I wanted to be Maria Callas,
and for a time I was.
Perhaps I should've simply
asked to be a woman.
And maybe instead
of juggling artists,
performance dates, continents,
and a roll in the sack,
you should've simply
asked to be a man.
How happy would we have been?
As just a woman and man,
as nothing extraordinary.
As it is, we both gave everything
and received...
Well, for a time, everything!
Almost!
So it goes.
- What on earth are you doing?
- Sorry.
Wipe your eyes, please.
I'm sorry.
You used to dress better.
What do you mean,
this is an expensive jacket.
It costs a fortune.
What'll you do now?
Have I bankrupted you?
I am alright.
I still have Bad Dreams,
as it were.
I thought maybe,
having the "Bolshoi Ballet" dance
"Spartacus" at the Coliseum...
Or whatever.
Maybe none of the above.
Perhaps I'll go to Tel Aviv
or Capetown to see an art show.
Maybe I'll stay home
and read books.
I think I'll walk some more.
It's a beautiful day.
What will you do?
Don't ask questions
that can't be answered.
Maria Callas, born Kalogeropoulou,
died on 16 September 1977.
"The events depicted in this film
belong to both the fantasy
of the author
and the memories
of his longstanding friendship
with Maria Callas."
