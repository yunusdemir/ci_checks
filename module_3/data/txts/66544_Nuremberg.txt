It was such a nice day,
 laughing, joking...
...and then they showed
 that horrid film.
Propaganda. Anyone can do it.
A little of this, a little of that,
and before you know it...
Still...
Those films...
I've read any number of affidavits,
reports, statistics.
But I didn't really understand
until I saw those films.
I still don't understand.
I don't think I ever Will.
How could civilized human beings
do that to other civilized human beings?
Maybe civilization's overrated.
Good night, Leutnant.
Goodnight, Reichsmarschall.
Dr. Speer, help me understand
what I witnessed today in the dining room.
Goring's ability to dominate
and intimidate without possessing...
...a real shred of power.
How do you explain that?
Habit. Instinct.
Something in the German character
that responds to authority...
...real or imagined.
-That's all it is?
-Yeah.
What about the ideas he expressed?
The words, thoughts, they had no impact?
What ideas? What thoughts?
There were only platitudes.
Nazi Germany was built
on empty platitudes.
A man like you,
you were seduced by empty platitudes?
Of course.
Because you can hear in them
any meaning you want.
You said earlier
you wanted to tell me something.
I've been trying to encourage
some of the other defendants...
...to join with me in accepting guilt
and expressing remorse.
I made progress with Frank,
and I have had high hopes...
...for young von Schirach.
But Goring means to bully them
into joining him.
And I fear now, he will succeed.
Unless someone stops him.
I understand.
All rise.
Herr Goring, do you believe that
the Nazi party came into power legally?
I do. And I am happy to explain in detail
the history of those first elections.
But I will add that once we came to power,
we were determined to hold onto it...
...under all circumstances.
We did not want to leave this
any longer to chance...
...to elections
and parliamentary majorities.
It had always been our plan
once we came to power...
...that we would eliminate the Reichstag...
...dissolve the regional parliaments,
end individual rights.
Where did the idea come from
to combine the ceremonial head of state...
...and the head of government
in one person, Adolf Hitler?
That's quite simple. We took our example
from the similar dual roles...
...of the President of the United States.
And the idea for concentration camps?
The idea was mine.
It Was a question of removing danger.
Only one course was available.
Protective custody.
How could the party rule
until it had established order?
And how could it maintain order
with its deadly enemies...
...particularly the Communists,
running free?
No further questions.
I don't get it. He's tightening the noose
around his own neck.
He doesn't care. He has bigger fish to fry.
He's talking over the heads of the tribunal
directly to the German people.
I suggest you isolate him from the others
when they're not in the courtroom.
I don't understand.
Why are you doing this?
Inside.
Me? I'm just following orders.
During cross...
...hit Goring quick and hard.
Put him on the defensive right away.
Never let him breathe.
I see no point in that at all.
He's blatantly incriminating himself.
All I need to do is ask direct questions
and let him answer them.
Be prepared with a tough line
of questioning.
In case it's needed.
-Thank you.
-Sure.
Why am I being punished like a schoolboy?
Speer?
Speer's behind this.
He must have talked to Colonel Andrus,
persuaded him into this line of action.
How do you know it wasn't me?
Why Dr. Speer? Is there rivalry
between the two of you?
He is ashamed of being a Nazi. I'm not.
He wishes to infect the others
with his shame.
You have no shame?
The world has now seen proof of
the horrors committed by Nazi Germany.
You are comfortable defending it?
I've seen so many horrors already.
The carnage of the First War...
...thousands of my countrymen maimed,
degraded, starved.
No, my dear doctor.
I am not an inhuman monster
who has no regard for human life.
These atrocities are not indifferent to me.
You know, we are accused
of so many appalling acts...
...it is hard to keep track.
-Did you try?
-My concern was war.
And in war, each nation has
its own selfish interest.
You have to be practical.
I am a practical man. And I'm a soldier.
And a soldier's code is obedience.
Obedience.
This amuses you?
Blind obedience Without responsibility.
Is there nobody in this country...
...that will take responsibility for anything?
Nobody who can say no?
Take a look at every cell in this block.
What do you see?
Yes men.
All the no men are six feet underground.
What is this?
You're not Jewish, are you?
Yes. I am.
I see.
This is a very interesting situation.
For both of us.
Good luck, old boy.
So, what's his plan?
I haven't a clue.
Will the witness repeat this oath after me?
"I swear by God the Almighty
and Omniscient... "
I swear by God the Almighty
and Omniscient...
"... that I will speak the pure truth...
"... and will withhold and add nothing. "
That I will speak the pure truth
and will withhold and add nothing.
Mr. Chief Prosecutor?
You are perhaps aware
that you are the only living man...
...who can expound to us...
...the true purposes of the Nazi Party
and the inner workings of its leadership.
I am perfectly aWare of that.
You, from the very beginning...
...together with those
who you were associated with...
...intended to overthrow,
and later on did overthrow...
...Germany's previous government,
the Weimar Republic?
That was my firm intention.
And upon coming to power
you immediately abolished parliamentary...
...democratic government in Germany.
We found it no longer to be necessary.
Is it not true that people
were subsequently thrown...
...into concentration camps
without recourse from the courts?
You must distinguish
between two categories.
Those who had committed a treason
against the new state...
...were turned over to the courts.
Others, of whom one might expect
such acts...
...but who had not yet committed them...
...such as functionaries
of the Communist Party...
...who were attacking us.
You answered the question.
I need to explain further.
You'll have the opportunity to explain...
...under re-examination
from your own counsel.
Did you prohibit all court review
of the cause for taking people...
...into what you were calling
"protective custody"?
That I answered very clearly,
but I'd like to make an explanation...
...about my answer.
Your counsel will see to that.
About the camps.
Mr. Justice Jackson.
The Tribunal thinks
the witness must be allowed to make...
...what explanation he thinks right
in answer to this question.
The Tribunal thinks
that you should be permitted...
...to explain your answer now...
...and it will listen to that explanation.
I want to say that I issued a decree...
...that those who were turned over
to the concentration camps...
...should be informed
after 24 hours of the reason...
...and allowed an attorney after 48 hours.
This by no means rescinded my order
that a court review...
...of these measures was not permitted.
By "protective custody" you mean...
...taking people in custody
who had not yet committed a crime...
...but you believed might commit
a crime in the future?
Yes, just as extensive protective measures
are being taken in Germany today.
I didn't ask you about Germany today.
Mr. Justice Jackson.
This is poor preparation.
The witness may finish his explanation.
You say that you were against
the attack on Soviet Russia.
Yet you gave no warning
to the German people.
You brought no pressure to bear
to prevent it.
You did not even resign
to protect your place in history.
We were at war, and such differences
of opinion could not be brought...
...before the public during War.
This was the case in your own country.
-Your second question.
-That'll suffice.
I'm not finished. Secondly...
Your Honor, please.
The witness must be allowed
to have his say.
As far as my resignation...
...I do not Wish even to discuss that...
...for I was an officer, a soldier.
I served my country.
-I ask you.
-Thirdly...
Your Honor, please!
Thirdly...
...I Was not the man to forsake someone...
...to whom I had given my oath of loyalty...
...every time he was not
to my way of thinking.
Your Honor!
It never, ever occurred to me
to leave the Fuhrer.
The witness is adopting
a contemptuous attitude...
...toward this Tribunal...
...which is giving him trial
that he never gave a living soul...
...nor dead ones either!
Objection, Your Honor.
I'm ready for the next question.
I think this is probably a good point
to adjourn for the day.
Tough calls from the bench.
Well, it's only Round One.
If you think you need anything,
don't forget, I'm here.
As the week ends, there's a consensus
among all present...
...that Hermann Goring now appears to be
in control of the court.
Will Jackson? Will anyone
be able to stop him?
Yes, Bob?
You know, Judge, I didn't leave
the Supreme Court to come here...
...and be thwarted by a fellow countrymen.
That sounds like sour grapes.
Very unbecoming.
To an outsider, it might appear like
you were trying to sabotage me.
You gave Goring an open forum
during direct examination.
I must be able to control him during cross.
Just accept the fact that you weren't
at the top of your game today.
You have the weekend
to prepare for the next round.
Make good use of it.
-Not hungry, sir?
-I'm too excited to eat.
Did you hear what I said?
My reply when he asked me
why I did not resign?
I lectured him about loyalty!
You should have seen Jackson's face.
It Was a completely foreign concept to him.
If I didn't know better,
I would say Jackson was a Jew.
No. Keep it.
My initials, see? Engraved.
It's real nice.
I'll never forget this.
I know, Leutnant. I know.
Sit down.
You know, my friends call me Tex.
All right, Tex.
Let me tell you something, Tex.
America will soon learn that
they are backing the wrong philosophy.
We should both be together
fighting the forces of Communism.
-You think?
-Yeah.
You think?
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
-I think we both agree, no?
-Yeah.
I'd like to dictate a telegram.
President Truman, the White House.
"Please accept my resignation as
Chief Prosecutor for the Nuremberg trials...
"... and appoint a replacement
at the earliest possible"
I'm not writing this. I won't.
You saw today that I'm not up to this task.
I could stay, out of pride,
and unravel everything...
...we've all worked so hard for.
Or I can step aside.
Bob, you are this trial.
Everything it is, everything it represents,
is from inside you.
Your thoughts, your values.
I tasted failure today...
...and realized what it would mean.
Not only to myself...
...but to everyone connected with this.
The only way they can triumph over you...
...is if their values are stronger than yours.
If they believe in their ideals
more than you believe in yours.
Is that true, Bob?
Does Hermann Goring
actually believe in his ideals...
...more than you believe in yours?
You're right.
And thank you.
You're welcome.
Now, look here. What happened
wasn't entirely your fault.
God knows, I'd be hard-pressed
to defeat a clever defendant...
...who's allowed to say whatever he wants
for as long as he wants.
Now that you've finished
with the niceties, let's have the truth.
Well, it was very damaging, Robert.
You've introduced this trial
from a position of moral superiority.
And as a result,
you've become its chief symbol.
If you can't maintain that...
...or if the balance shifts ever so slightly
it could be a disaster.
Hermann Goring is using this trial...
...to present himself as a
philosopher-statesman on Hitler's level.
Do you see Goring as a statesman?
No, I do not. I see him as reprehensible.
As inhuman.
Then treat him as such.
Treat him as the vile, conniving...
...bloody fascist bastard that he is.
Where the hell is he?
He'll be here.
Mr. Chief Prosecutor, if you are ready.
From the very beginning,
you regarded the elimination of the Jews...
...from the economic life of Germany
as under your jurisdiction, did you not?
Yeah. The elimination from economic life,
that is partly correct.
Large industries, also armament industries
under Jewish directors.
Was that the first of your legal measures
against the Jews?
I believe removal from office was first,
in 1933.
Then, in 1936,
you personally drafted an act...
...making it punishable by death
to transfer property abroad?
That is correct.
And another that all damage caused
to Jewish property...
...by the anti-Jewish riots of 1938...
...must be repaired by Jews
at their own expense...
...with their insurance claims
forfeited to the Reich.
I did sign a similar law.
Whether it was exactly the same, I...
And did you not say about those riots...
I show you this transcript.
Did you not say,
"I wish you had killed 200 Jews...
"... instead of destroying such valuables"?
That was said in a moment of bad temper
and extreme excitement.
Spontaneous sincerity, in other words.
Did you not also personally sign a decree
in September, 1940...
...ordering seizure
of all Jewish property in Poland?
I assume so, if the decree is there.
And another, which provided
that Jews receive no compensation...
...for damages caused by enemy attacks
or by German forces?
If the law bears my name,
then it must be so.
Is this your signature?
It appears to be.
Is it, or is it not, your signature?
It is.
Your signature...
...on a decree dated July, 1941
asking Himmler...
...and Heydrich and the SS to make plans...
...for the "final solution"
of the Jewish question.
That is not a proper translation.
I said "total" solution, not "final" solution.
These are your words to Himmler:
"I charge you to send me before long
an overall plan concerning...
"... the organizational, factual
and material measures necessary...
"... for the desired solution
of the Jewish question. "
Is that an accurate translation of this order
from you to Heydrich and Himmler?
That had to do with emigration
and evacuation of the Jews.
You ordered all government agencies
to cooperate with the SS...
...in the final solution
of the Jewish question.
There's nothing in there about the SS.
This document states you personally
ordered all government agencies...
...to cooperate with the SS.
You sent this letter
to SS Gruppenfuhrer Heydrich.
That doesn't mean that the SS
had anything to do with the solution...
...to the Jewish question.
Would you mind repeating that?
I must say this clearly.
I did not know anything that took place...
...or the methods that were used
in the concentration camps later.
These things were kept secret from me.
And I might add...
...that in my opinion...
...even the Fuhrer did not know
the extent of what was happening.
Witness, there is evidence
before this court...
...that nearly 10 million people
have been exterminated.
Murdered in cold blood.
You mean to say that you did not,
and in your opinion, Hitler did not...
...knoW What took place
in the concentration camps?
Yeah.
Do you know that Hitler said in 1943...
...in a recorded meeting,
I read you his words now.
Quote: "The Reich's Minister
of Foreign Affairs...
"... declared that the Jews
should be exterminated...
"... or taken to concentration camps.
"There is no other possibility. "
The Minister of Foreign Affairs,
Ribbentrop...
...talked with Hitler about extermination.
And you were above Ribbentrop.
You were Hitler's second-in-command.
You were in charge
of the economic Four Year Plan...
...so you knew all about
the gold wedding rings...
...the gold teeth and the gold eyeglasses
that the victims left behind.
And you have heard
that it took five extra minutes...
...to kill the women
because they had to cut their hair off...
...to be used in making mattresses.
And nothing was told to you...
...about this material that came from
these people that had been murdered?
No.
No!
How can you imagine such a thing?
I was laying down the broad outlines
of the German economy.
-The witness is excused.
-I'm not finished!
-The witness is excused.
-I am not finished!
The witness is excused.
You know what would've been
a great touch?
Hermann Goring showing up
in a Santa outfit.
He'd probably do it.
After all, he was the Third Reich's
chief bon vivant.
Did you ever see pictures of him
at Hitler's mountain retreat...
...dressed like a Tyrollean chorus boy
out of some grotesque operetta?
Excuse me.
Leaving so soon?
Some of the defendants asked me
to come by tonight.
A little Christmas Eve chat with their rabbi.
You know the trial is about to enter
a new phase, a very important one.
The defendants will have to choose
between stonewalling and evading...
...or taking responsibility for their actions.
Now, you are the best chance we have
to influence that choice.
Frau Hassel?
Is something wrong?
Do not ask me to serve the Russians.
Please.
They're our guests.
My son was killed on the Russian front.
Okay. I'll take care of this.
Go to the kitchen.
Try these little sausage things, General.
I forget what Frau Hassel calls them,
but I hear they're mighty tasty.
Madame.
20 million of my people
were killed by the Germans.
Do you think I could be offended
by the snub of a Hausfrau?
I don't know what to think, General.
Frankly, I can't keep track
of all the politics in this room.
The Russians sure don't disappear
in a crowd, do they?
Politics.
They've suffered more in this war
than any other country.
Must be doubly painful
to attract such little sympathy for them.
And Jackson decreed no wives
could come along.
Worked out quite nicely for him,
wouldn't you say?
Merry Christmas.
This was a very nice gesture.
I figured it's probably their last Christmas.
Merry Christmas, Colonel.
-Field Marshal.
-Doctor.
How are you?
I'm so glad that you are here.
Please, sit. You are the only one
I can really talk to.
But you don't talk to me, Field Marshal.
Not really.
-I tell you everything about my family.
-Yes.
But not about you.
I would like to understand
how a man like you...
...a man of your background...
...could have drafted an instrument
like the Commando Order.
Allied soldiers found
behind enemy lines were shot...
...rather than captured?
Or the Night and Fog Decree:
suspected Resistance members...
...were arrested in the middle of the night
and secretly murdered.
Because of you.
I know. I am dying of shame.
Don't you think it's time you admitted that
to the rest of the world?
I'm not in the mood, all right.
Get off of me.
Get off!
You were signing orders
that broke international laws and treaties.
How could you not question
what you were doing?
Does a lieutenant say to his captain,
"Just a minute, sir, I have to consult...
"... the Hague Convention to see
if I am allowed to carry out your orders?"
If we had disobeyed,
we would have been arrested.
Rightly so.
You realize without the support
of his generals, Herr Jodl...
...Hitler could not have waged war.
It is a soldier's duty is to obey orders.
That is a code I have lived by all my life.
And that code extends to the people
who ran the death camps?
I'm sorry, sir.
Tex, my friend. Come in.
-Sit down.
-Thank you.
It's good to see you.
I know that Christmastime can be
a lonely thing away from home.
Merry Christmas, Reichsmarschall.
My dear Tex, what luxury.
Prost.
-Cognac.
-Yeah.
So what would you be doing now
back in Texas?
On Christmas morning, we'd open
our presents and then go to church.
Then, we'd head over
to Grandma and Grandpa's...
...for a big roast turkey dinner.
After that, Dad, Grandpa and me...
...we'd go out back
hunting for pheasant, quail.
Hunting! Hunting was my passion!
I was Germany's chief gamekeeper.
No kidding.
The shooting around my estates
at Carinhall was wonderful.
Did Hitler ever go hunting with you?
I shouldn't tell you this,
but Hitler did not approve of hunting.
He felt that killing animals was immoral.
-He was a vegetarian.
-Yeah?
Yes. He was a vegetarian.
Yeah, but that did not stop him from
being the most gracious host in Europe.
His dinner parties were legend.
Always the finest caviar and champagne.
Thought he did not partake,
he was not intolerant.
He would dazzle his guests
with every view under the sun until dawn.
I remember once we were celebrating
the triumph of Compiegne...
...where we savored the sweet revenge...
...of the French having surrendered
in the very same railway car...
...that the Germans had capitulated in,
in 1918.
That must've been something.
It was, believe me.
It Was.
You know...
...I have made my career
as a military man...
...and I have to say you remind me...
...of some of the finest young German
soldiers who served under me.
Thank you.
Merry Christmas.
Hello, America.
As Christmas descends
upon this sad and broken city...
...I'm here,
inside her great Palace of Justice.
And on this Christmas Eve, as we're filled
with thoughts of peace on Earth...
...it is here that the future of peace...
...may well be determined.
Herr von Ribbentrop,
would you agree that as Foreign Minister...
...you forced Czechoslovakia
to surrender its territory...
...by the most intolerable threats
of aggression?
I do not agree.
You threatened to send your army in.
In overwhelming strength.
And also bomb Prague.
What further pressure could you
possibly have put upon them?
War, for instance.
War?
What is that but war?
Ribbentrop should be hanged
for his stupidity.
That is the greatest crime of all.
In your newspaper, Herr Streicher...
...you wrote that the Jews are "a nation
of bloodsuckers and extortionists. "
Do you think that's preaching race hatred?
No. I do not think it's preaching
race hatred.
It is simply a statement of fact!
Dr. Funk...
...you were President of the Reichsbank
during the war?
I was, yes.
And you accepted unusual deposits
into your bank, didn't you?
I do not know what you refer to.
I am referring to deposits sent to you
by the SS from concentration camps.
I have no knowledge of...
Inside the Reichsbank vaults,
there were literally piles of jewelry.
Gold watches, gold earrings,
gold eyeglass frames.
And gold teeth!
Many people deposit valuables in a bank...
...and the bank is not required
to look into them.
Prior to 1939, exactly how many
of your customers...
...deposited their teeth into your bank?
You've heard a guard at Mauthausen
concentration camp testify...
...that you watched while the gas chamber
was demonstrated on inmates.
I never set foot in Mauthausen!
And we have heard eyewitness testimony
from three people...
...that you were at Mauthausen
three times.
They are lying!
And before he died...
...the commandant at Mauthausen
signed this statement...
...that you ordered him to put
65,000 Jews in a tunnel and seal it off...
...rather than allow them
to be liberated by the Allies.
He is lying!
Is it not a fact that you are lying
to the Tribunal about this...
...as you lied about everything else
in your testimony?
That is also a lie!
Kaltenbrunner has asked the commandant
of Auschwitz testify in his defense.
-If that's a joke, I don't get it.
-I don't get it either, but it's no joke.
The British have him in custody
and agree to transfer him here to testify.
Maybe he just figures
he'll look better by comparison.
We're not going to allow this, are we?
Let the guy walk in, say God knows what
on the stand, give Kaltenbrunner an alibi?
Might be a cheap price to pay
for the opportunity to cross-examine him.
During the entire time you were
commandant of Auschwitz...
...did Ernst Kaltenbrunner
ever visit the camp?
No.
Not once?
Never.
Thank you.
One minute, please.
Mr. Hoess.
How long were you commandant
of Auschwitz concentration camp?
From the beginning.
And what was its purpose?
At that time...
...to house prisoners who were being held
in protective custody.
And after that?
I was called to Berlin by my boss...
...Reichsfuhrer Himmler, in 1941.
And he informed me
that the Fuhrer had ordered...
...the final solution of the Jewish question.
I Was not sure What I Was supposed to do.
So Adolf Eichmann advised me
to visit a camp at Treblinka...
...to learn from its operation.
And what did you learn there?
Actually, I was not impressed.
It was taking the commandant there
six months...
...to eliminate 80,000 Jews
using monoxide gas.
I had a better idea.
One of my Auschwitz guards...
...had accidentally sniffed
a chemical disinfectant called Zyklon B...
...and had passed out immediately.
It occurred to me,
if a little of this chemical killed lice...
...enough, perhaps, would kill a human.
I tested it on Soviet prisoners of war
locked in a room, and it worked.
Within 3 to 15 minutes, they were dead.
And then?
I built gas chambers to accommodate
2,000 inmates at a time...
...compared to Treblinka's 200.
And I built four large ovens
to cremate the remains.
It became possible to eliminate
10,000 people in 24 hours.
But that was at peak operation,
which was exhausting for my staff.
On the average, we would dispatch...
...2,000 people a day.
How many men did it take
to dispatch 2,000 people a day?
I had a staff of approximately 3,000 men.
And during your tenure at Auschwitz...
...how many people did you dispose of
in this fashion?
Approximately two and a half million.
No further questions.
I Wish to make this clear.
I did not tolerate gratuitous cruelty.
My men were there to exterminate people,
not torment them.
Any misconduct by the guards
was punished.
I can assure you.
The witness is excused.
Court is adjourned
until 9:00 tomorrow morning.
My life was entirely normal.
Even while doing this extermination work...
...I would say I led
a perfectly normal family life.
How would you describe that life?
I've always been happiest alone.
I never had any real intimacy
with my parents, my sisters...
Do you feel...
...that the Jews you murdered
deserved their fate?
I have always been taught
that the Jew was an enemy of Germany.
So when you were ordered to turn
your prison camp into a death camp...
...you never once thought
what you were doing was wrong?
I Was an SS man.
We were trained to obey orders
without thinking.
Does a rat-catcher think it is wrong
to kill rats?
A rat catcher catching rats.
Is that the kind of thinking it takes to
carry out state-sanctioned mass murder?
Not just blind obedience, but also a belief
that your victims are not human?
Let me ask you this. What was Hiroshima?
Was it not your medical experiment?
Would America have dropped bombs
as easily on Germany...
...as it did upon Japan,
killing as many civilians as possible?
I think not. To an American's sensibility...
...a Caucasian child is considerably
more human than a Japanese child.
America was at war with Japan.
A country that had attacked it
without provocation.
You murdered millions
of your own citizens.
What about the American citizens
of the Japanese race...
...put into "protective custody"
in your own concentration camps?
That was wrong.
Why was this not done to Americans
of Italian and German descent?
I said it was wrong.
What about the Negro officers
in your own army?
Are they allowed
to command troops in combat?
Can they sit on the same buses
as the whites?
Segregation laws in your country
and anti-Semitic laws in mine:
Are they not just a difference of degree?
Let me tell you,
from the beginning of the century...
...through the First War
until the rise of Hitler...
...the freemasonry
of the Jewish merchants...
...consistently undermined
the German economy...
...and the nationhood of the fatherland.
That is why we made anti-Semitic laws.
And why you, my friend,
can never understand anti-Semitism. Why?
Because you are a Jew.
Is defense counsel ready to proceed?
Ready, Your Honor.
Herr Sauckel, from March, 1942,
you were in charge of procuring labor...
...for the war effort. Is that right?
Ja.
You are aware that it was a crime
under the Hague Convention...
...to forcibly deport citizens
of other countries to Germany as workers?
Ja.
How many foreign workers
came into Germany during your tenure?
Approximately five million.
And how many of them came voluntarily?
Perhaps 200,000.
Did you issue these directives
calling for their decent treatment?
I did.
I ask that these be marked as exhibits
and accepted into evidence.
So ordered.
Herr Sauckel, who ordered you
to procure these workers?
Speer.
Albert Speer, Minister of Armaments.
He gave orders to you?
Ja.
-And you had to obey them?
-Ja.
Every worker you brought in,
it was under Speer's orders?
It Was.
No further questions.
I know this is unorthodox, Mr. Dodd,
to request an audience with you...
...the man assigned to cross-examine me.
There's nothing very orthodox
about this whole trial, Dr. Speer.
My lawyer's trying to talk me out
of confessing to war crimes...
...that might incur the death penalty.
I do not wish to hide the truth
just to save my life...
...only to hate myself
for the rest of that life.
-I wish other defendants shared that view.
-Some of them do.
Many are still under Goring's influence.
He's your chief rival for the souls
of other defendants...
...if I may put it so dramatically.
Goring was cross-examined
by the chief prosecutor, Justice Jackson...
...while I am to be questioned by you,
a subordinate.
This difference was noticed
by the other defendants.
In their eyes, it puts me
in an inferior status to Goring.
That's a peculiar measure of status,
Dr. Speer.
Not to a German War criminal.
I hope you don't have a problem With it.
No. I've got no ego riding on this.
I'll present your request
to my superior, Mr. Jackson.
Dr. Speer, did you disapprove
of Sauckel's recruitment of labor?
On the contrary.
I was grateful to Sauckel
for every worker he provided.
When we failed to meet
armament quotas...
...because of shortage of workers,
I would blame Sauckel.
Do you wish to limit your responsibility
to your own particular sphere of work?
No. This war has brought
an inconceivable catastrophe.
As an important member
of the leadership of the Reich...
...I share in the total responsibility
for the disaster of the German people.
Dr. Speer, near the end of the war,
did you not refuse to carry out...
...Hitler's order to raze Germany
to the ground?
I've no intention of using my actions
during that phase of the war...
...to help me in my personal defense.
But I would like those
who sit in judgment of me...
...to understand that period.
In March of 1945,
Hitler intended, deliberately...
...to destroy the means of life
for his own people if the war were lost.
He said, "Let the Allies conquer
nothing but ashes. "
But you resisted his wishes,
sending him instead this memorandum.
Would you read it to the court, please?
"Nobody has the right to destroy
industrial plants...
"... coal mines, electrical plants,
and other facilities.
"We have no right to carry out destruction
which might affect the life of the people.
"Signed, Speer. "
We have heard here that people were shot
for disagreeing with Hitler.
Is this true?
That did happen.
And yet, not only did you disagree
with him...
...but early in 1945 you actually made
a plan to assassinate Hitler.
He What?
Is that not so?
Yes, it is so.
Traitor!
It is so...
...because of what I viewed
as his insane destructiveness.
What did you do?
What was your plan?
I kneW of an air-intake shaft...
...in the Reich Chancellery garden
that ventilated the Fuhrerbunker below.
I went to the head
of my munitions department and said:
"There's only one way to end this war...
...and asked him to get me...
...a poison gas to drop
into the ventilating system. "
But the next time I went there,
they had built a 12-foot chimney...
...protecting the ventilator,
and SS guards were patrolling there.
So it came to nothing.
Mr. Chief Prosecutor?
You acknowledge responsibility
for Germany's large policies...
...but not for the details occurred
in their execution.
-Is that a fair statement of your position?
-Yes, sir. Very fair.
May I ask the witness a question
in order to clarify this answer, please?
You may.
Do you want to acknowledge guilt
under criminal law...
...or do you wish to record
a historical responsibility...
...before your own people
and before history?
The question is a very difficult one
to answer.
It is actually one which the Tribunal...
...will decide in its verdict.
Cuffs off!
You would assassinate the Fuhrer?
I tell you this, coward.
If you get out alive,
we'll put together our own court...
...and execute you for treason!
Lock them up!
As a German officer, I consider it my duty
to answer for all I have done.
It will not always be possible to separate
guilt from the threads of destiny.
But the men in the front lines
cannot be charged with guilt...
...while the highest leaders
reject responsibility.
That is wrong.
It was my guilt...
...which I carry before God
and the entire German nation...
...that I educated the youth of Germany
for a man who I considered to be...
...an impeccable leader and head of state.
But I educated the youth of Germany...
...for a man who committed murder
a millionfold.
And this guilt of Germany
will not yet be erased.
Good afternoon, Captain.
The prisoners aren't allowed visitors.
I am the wife of Reichsmarschall Goring.
This is his daughter.
No exceptions, ma'am.
Frau Goring.
-My name is Captain Gilbert.
-Hello.
Nice to meet you. Would you have
a moment to spend with me, to talk?
Yes.
-Very good.
-This is Edda.
Hello, Edda. I'm Captain Gilbert.
Do you like chocolate?
It must have been very difficult for you
these last few months.
Especially With your little girl.
It could have been worse, I suppose.
Hitler could have survived.
You've obviously come to terms
with the truth.
I wish your husband could do the same.
But he persists in remaining loyal
to Hitler's memory.
Yes, I cannot understand it, either.
Such loyalty to a man
who wanted us dead.
-I'mm sorry?
-Hitler ordered all of us to be shot.
Hermann, myself...
...our precious child.
That is why we surrendered
to the Americans.
Why else would we have done
such a thing?
I went through my notes last night.
I've spent all these months trying
to find a way inside their minds.
Hoping to understand how those people
could commit such atrocities...
...against my people.
I believe there are a couple of factors
that explain a lot of it.
First, Germany is a country
where people do what they're told.
You obey your parents, teachers,
clergymen, superior officers.
You're raised from childhood
not to question authority.
When Hitler comes to power,
he has an entire nation that believes...
...it's perfectly natural
to do whatever he says.
Second, propaganda.
For years, Germans have been bombarded
with ideas like:
"Jews are not real human beings"
or "They're a corruption of the race. "
When the government says it's permissible
to deny Jews their rights...
...and then says it's imperative to kill
these inferior people...
...they comply.
Even if they've been
your friends or neighbors.
Anything else?
I told you once that I was searching
for the nature of evil.
I think I've come close to defining it.
A lack of empathy.
It's the one characteristic
that connects all the defendants.
A genuine incapacity
to feel with their fellow man.
Evil, I think, is the absence of empathy.
I call on the chief prosecutor
for his closing argument.
Mr. President and members of the tribunal.
It is impossible in summation to do more
than outline with bold strokes...
...the vitals of this trial's mad
and melancholy record.
For no time has ever witnessed
slaughter on such a grand scale.
Such cruelties and inhumanities,
such wholesale deportations...
...of peoples into slavery,
such annihilations of minorities.
Events which will live
as the historical text...
...of the 20th century's
shame and depravity.
Terror was the order of the day.
Civilians were arrested without charges,
committed without counsel...
...executed without hearing.
Villages were destroyed,
the male inhabitants shot...
...or sent to forced labor...
...and the children scattered abroad.
The Nazi movement will be of evil memory
because of its persecution of the Jews...
...the most far-flung
and terrible racial persecution of all time.
So thorough and uncompromising was
this program that the Jews of Europe...
...as a race, no longer exist.
Thus fulfilling the diabolic "prophesy"
of Adolf Hitler at the beginning of the war.
Generations to come
will remember this decade.
If We cannot eliminate the cause...
...and prevent the repetition
of these barbaric events...
...this century may yet succeed...
...in bringing the doom of civilization.
The time has come for final judgment
and if the case I present seems hard...
...and uncompromising...
...then it is only because
the evidence makes it so.
A glance at the dock will show
that despite quarrels among themselves...
...each defendant played a part
that fitted in with every other...
...and all advanced a common plan.
It was these men among millions of others,
and it was these men...
...leading millions of others,
who built up Adolf Hitler.
They intoxicated him.
He, of the psychopathic personality...
...with power and adulation.
They fed his hates, aroused his fears.
They put a loaded gun in his eager hands.
It was left to Hitler to pull the trigger.
When he did, they all...
...at that time, applauded.
Hitler's guilt stands admitted...
...by some defendants reluctantly...
...by some, vindictively.
But Hitler's guilt is the guilt
of the whole dock...
...and of every man in it.
These defendants now ask this tribunal
to say they are not guilty...
...of planning, executing,
or conspiring to commit...
...this long list of crimes and wrongs.
They stand before the record of
this Tribunal as bloodstained Gloucester...
...stood by the body of his slain king.
He begged the widow, as they beg of you:
"Say I slew them not. "
And the Queen replied,
"Then say they are not slain.
"But dead they are. "
If you were to say of these men
that they are not guilty...
...it would be as true to say
that there has been no war.
There are no slain.
There has been no crime.
Captain.
"Jews escalate fight for homeland. "
It's ironic.
After all that's happened
over the past 10 years...
...I don't blame the Jews
for wanting a homeland.
One of the many ripples we'll see
from this war and from this trial.
-Shall we?
-Yeah.
The defendants may now
make their final statements.
Defendant Hermann Goring.
This has been a poor excuse for a trial.
But firstly, I must reiterate
my lack of knowledge...
...for these terrible mass murders,
which I cannot begin to understand...
...and furthermore,
I condemn wholeheartedly.
As to the trial, the statements
of the defendants were accepted as true...
...only when they supported
the prosecution.
They were treated as perjury
when they refuted the indictment.
This is not a basis of proof.
Why am I in the dock being treated
as a common criminal?
I say to my judges, have no illusions.
Since the three greatest powers on earth,
together with other nations fought us...
...we finally were conquered
by tremendous enemy superiority.
Justice has absolutely nothing
to do with this trial.
Defendant Albert Speer.
How could so advanced, so cultured...
...so sophisticated a nation as Germany...
...have fallen under Hitler's demonic sway?
The explanation
is modern communications.
No longer does a leader have to delegate
authority afar to subordinates...
...exercising independent judgment.
Given modern communications,
a Hitler can rule directly and personally.
Thus, the more technical
the world becomes...
...the more individual freedom...
...and the self-rule of mankind
becomes essential.
This war has ended on the note
of radio-controlled rockets.
Aircraft approaching the speed of sound.
Submarines and torpedoes
which can find their own targets.
Atom bombs...
...and the horrible prospect
of chemical warfare.
In five to ten years, this kind of warfare
will offer the possibility of firing rockets...
...from continent to continent
with uncanny precision.
Through the smashing of the atom...
...it will be possible to kill 1 million people
in New York City in a matter of seconds...
...with a rocket serviced
by perhaps ten men.
A new large-scale war will end
with the destruction...
...of human culture and civilization.
That is why this trial must contribute...
...to the prevention
of such wars in the future.
A nation believing in its future
will never perish.
May God protect Germany...
...and the culture of the West.
We are agreed. Three of four votes
will be required for the finding of guilty.
-Agreed.
-Agreed.
Now, if the judgment is death,
might we not consider...
...the firing squad
for the military defendants?
I disagree most strongly.
The bullet is for the honorable adversary,
not for butchers.
I say hanging.
-I agree.
-I agree.
We will take the defendants
in the order they were indicted.
Goring.
Bravo.
Go on, have some of the lovely food.
There is talk that you will all be hanged.
I won't be hanged.
That I assure you. That I pledge.
Perhaps the court
will send you to an island, like Elba.
We could join you there.
Go on, eat.
Do you think that we would be allowed
to take some of the food home with us?
I don't see why not.
The Charter clearly states
that following orders...
..."may be considered in mitigation
of punishment. "
"May be," not must be.
You have become
such beautiful young ladies.
When are they going to shoot you, Papa?
Hans Frank is a most tragic figure...
...in my view.
His penitence is obviously real.
It would be a meaningful gesture
for us to spare his life.
No.
He should hang.
Atten-hut!
All rise.
Each defendant will stand
as his name is called...
...to hear the judgments
on the four counts applicable to him...
...and the sentence,
if found guilty on any of the counts.
The counts, numbered one
through four, are:
Conspiracy to commit aggression.
The commission of aggression.
Crimes in the conduct of warfare...
...and crimes against humanity.
Defendant Hermann Goring.
The Tribunal finds you guilty
on all four counts...
...and sentences you...
...to death by hanging.
Rudolf Hess.
On the charges of crimes
against humanity...
...the Tribunal finds you not guilty.
But we find you guilty
on counts one and two...
...and thereby sentence you
to imprisonment for life.
Admiral Wilhelm Keitel.
Guilty on all four counts.
The Tribunal sentences you
to death by hanging.
Defendant Hans Frank.
The Tribunal finds you guilty
on counts three and four...
...and sentences you to death by hanging.
Julius Streicher.
Guilty on count four,
crimes against humanity.
Death by hanging.
Defendant Schacht.
The Tribunal has come to the conclusion
that evidence against Hjalmar Schacht...
...has not been established
beyond a reasonable doubt...
...and therefore finds that Schacht
is not guilty on this indictment.
Quiet, please.
The Defendant Karl Donitz.
Guilty on counts two and three.
The Tribunal sentences you
to ten years imprisonment.
Foreign Minister von Ribbentrop.
Guilty on all four counts.
The Tribunal sentences you
to death by hanging.
Ernst Kaltenbrunner.

Defendant Fritz Sauckel.
Guilty on counts three and four.
Death by hanging.
Defendant Albert Speer.
The Tribunal finds you not guilty
on counts one and two.
But you have been found guilty
on counts three and four.
Albert Speer, the Court sentences you...
...to 20 years imprisonment.
The work of this Tribunal is now complete.
Lock them up!
Leutnant, my dear Tex,
why this long face?
Have I not told you there's a special place
in Valhalla waiting for me?
I don't know.
I thought things might have
turned out differently.
Well, you know, they might have done,
if it wasn't a very unfortunate thing.
Those mass murders.
I must tell you,
I could not see their purpose.
They were absolutely unnecessary.
They made no sense
from a nationalistic point of view.
Our legacy has been forever tainted.
But make no mistake.
Everything Hitler did before the war
was right. The German people knew it.
One day, they'll remember it.
And you must remember it too,
my dear Tex.
When you remember me, remember that.
Yeah.
Now, to practical matters.
-There are a few things I want to give you.
-No, sir!
Please.
Where I'm going, I must travel light.
It's inscribed, see, with my name. Take it.
Take it.
The few valuables I have, they are
in my blue briefcase in the baggage room.
Can you retrieve that for me, my dear Tex?
Yes, sir.
Where are they building those gallows?
Down in the back.
Third building on the right.
I have only one question to ask you.
Is there absolutely no possibility that
I may be allowed to face a firing squad...
...and die a soldier's death?
None.
Just as well. I hear the Americans
are very poor shots.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I must write a letter.
For the rest of my life,
Herr Reichsmarschall...
...people will ask me what
your final thoughts were.
I'll have nothing to tell them.
You can tell them this:
I say, for now and all time:
The foreigners who have imposed
this sentence upon me may murder me...
...but they have no right to judge me.
That I deny them.
Now, you must excuse me,
I do have to write this letter. Thank you.
My one and only sweetheart.
My life came to an end
when I bade you farewell for the last time.
Do not grieve, my dearest one.
Since then I have felt at peace with myself,
and consider my death a deliverance.
All my thoughts are with you
and our own dear, sweet child.
My last heartbeats,
of our great and eternal love.
Colonel, may I?
-You got what you want?
-I got it, sir.
Gentlemen, follow me.
Mein Gott.
Get dressed.
Get a doctor!
Somebody get a doctor!
Cyanide.
Son of a bitch.
-State your name.
-Joachim von Ribbentrop.
Do you have anything to say?
My last wish is that Germany
realize its destiny.
I Wish peace to the World.
-Do you have anything to say?
-I now join my sons.
Deutschland uber alles!
Three.
I'm dying an innocent man.
I ask God to accept me With my sin.
Heil Hitler.
Heil Hitler!
Seven.
All cleaned out. Everything.
The cells are to be scrubbed clean.
Nothing's to be left.
Nothing.
Danke schon.
Thanks.
You know, when we get home,
we've got some decisions to make.
Some personal decisions.
Let's just wait till we get home.
Hello, you two.
You know it may sound strange...
...but I can't help feeling
a touch sentimental about all this.
I understand.
I got a letter from a friend today
saying that because of what we've done...
...none of it can ever happen again.
What do you think?
Well...
We can hope, cant we?
Bye.
