Let's go, buster.
Beer.
And a bottle.
Ain't much good.
It's all there is.
Will you want anything else?
Just a peaceful hour to drink it in.
Flea-bitten range bums
don't usually stop in Lago.
Life here's a little
too quick for them.
Maybe you think you're fast
enough to keep up with us?
A lot faster than
you'll ever live to be.
Yes, sir?
Shave and a hot bath?
That'll be 90 cents.
Cash.
Well, what I mean to say is that
the 90 cents usually comes first.
But, hell, it don't really matter.
Before or after, what's the diff?
Sir.
Eau de lilac's only 10 cents more.
Lilac water.
The ladies love it.
Shall we make it
an even dollar? No.
Yes.
Moses.
Right you are, gentlemen.
Be right with you.
Just have a chair.
What, you don't like our company?
What's the matter with you?
I'm speaking to you, pig shit.
I think he's got some
of that pig shit in his ear.
I don't know which smells worse,
him or the shit in the bottle.
What did you say
your name was again?
I didn't.
No. I guess you
didn't at that, did you?
Why don't you watch
where you're going?
Look at this. It's ruined.
There's no need for all that.
All what?
If you want to get acquainted,
why don't you just say so?
Acquainted?
Why, you'd be amusing
if you weren't so pathetic.
Just a minute.
I'm not finished with you yet.
You know, at a distance,
you'd almost pass for a man.
But you're certainly a disappointment
up close, aren't you?
To your feet, ma'am.
They're almost as big as your mouth.
You know what you are?
Just trash.
A bottle of whiskey for courage
and the manners of a goat.
You're the one who could
use a lesson in manners.
Not from you, whiskey breath.
Let go of me!
Let go!
Let go of me!
Let go of me, you! Put me down!
Help me!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
My horse.
A room.
Would you like to register,
please, sir?
Somebody, please help me.
Damn you all to hell.
- Good morning. Sleep well?
- Yeah.
Say, are you planning to stay
keep your room another night?
I'll let you know.
All right, anything you say.
Morning.
I've still got a bath coming.
Nice hot bath coming right up.
Yes, sir.
Mordecai, you put some more
hot water in that tub there.
This gentleman wants a bath.
You can hang your clothes
right down there on the peg.
Now, Miss Peekins does a nice...
I'm sorry.
Right this way, Captain, sir.
Unless you want Mordecai
to take them out
and get them laundered
while you're soaking.
Miss Peekins does a right
clean boiled wash.
Uses lye for pants rabbits, she does.
No itch, no scratch.
Well, pour the water, Mordecai,
before it gets cold.
We want the gentleman
to be comfortable.
Well, I've been wanting
to talk to you.
I might as well get this stool here
and set right down and do it, right?
If that's all right with you?
Well, what's it about is Billy Borders.
Don't know the man.
Well, you missed your chance,
'cause you shot him yesterday.
Him and Ike Sharp and Fred Morris.
You know, those are just the names,
in case you're interested.
Well, I'm not really
interested, sheriff.
Well, I can't say
I blame you, you know.
Billy, he wasn't a loved man, no.
And he didn't have much personality.
What he did have was all bad,
just bad.
What you're trying to say
is there's no charge, right?
Well, forgive and forget, you know.
That's our motto.
You dirty bastard!
I'll kill you!
Damn it, Callie!
Callie, damn it!
Let go of me, you fat lug!
Stop...
Tell him I'd appreciate it
if he doesn't leave town
until I talk to him.
Goddamn it!
I'll kill you!
I wonder what took her
so long to get mad.
Because maybe you
didn't go back for more.
It don't seem to me
that we got a choice.
Seeing we got no time
to send for help
and further seeing that our sheriff's
about as much use as tits on a boar.
Sorry I'm late.
Anything happen?
No, no, his honor's had the floor.
In case you haven't heard it yet
Stacey Bridges and the Carlin brothers
are due to get out of jail today.
They coming here?
That's been their plan,
according to all reports.
There's no reason
to believe they've changed it.
Possibly they've repented their ways.
Preacher, they're gonna burn this
town to the ground and you know it.
What we're talking about
now is a way to stop them.
We gotta find that way now and quick.
Nevertheless, my conscience
will not allow me to be a party
to the hiring of
a professional gunfighter.
Well, maybe you'd like to go out there
and stand them off yourself, preacher.
I'm just a simple man of God.
Well, it's time we unsimplified you,
Reverend.
Now, Borders, Morris and Short
were professional gunfighters
on the payroll of The Lago
Mining Company
to protect our interests
and the interests of this town
which are identical.
They stood around drinking beer
and looking snotty for a full year.
And then one day before
we actually needed the bastards
they managed to get
themselves killed.
So if you've got a suggestion
we'd be delighted to hear it.
Otherwise, take your
conscience elsewhere
while we think about
saving your ass.
Land's sakes.
Where's time gone to?
Miss Peekins' eldest
is feeling poorly.
I promised I'd...
Will you gentlemen excuse me?
Well, we were talking about
hiring a gunfighter.
We don't know anything
about that fellow there.
Well, we know he took
the best we could find to hire
like Grant took Vicksburg.
With a hidden gun in his lap.
Three for three.
One right between the eyes.
Goddamndest shooting
I ever even heard of.
I still say we're asking for trouble!
A fellow like that, what do
we know about him?
Who is he?
Where does he come from?
Well, you've got our permission
to go and ask him.
Although, the last three that tried
that didn't fare all that well.
Let me out!
Put me down, you bastard!
Let go of me, you fat lug!
Get the hell off me!
Let go of me!
You fat pig!
Hey, come here. What is this?
I was just down there
sounding out that stranger
when she come in there
blasting away like a Cheyenne!
All right, Sam. All right.
You're planning to let him get
away with this, aren't you?
- Be a little patient, will you?
- Patient?
Callie, when you run across a man
who's used to having his own way
you let him have it
until he goes too far.
Just what do you consider
going too far?
I mean, isn't forcible rape in broad
daylight a misdemeanor in this town?
There's too much at stake
to throw away on hysterics now.
Hysterics?
Well, I can remember some hysterics
one night not too long ago.
Callie, keep your mouth shut!
Morgan, get her out of here.
I'll see you later.
Not while that squinty-eyed
son of a bitch
is still breathing, you won't!
You wonder if there's
a man left in this town!
I mean, one honest-to-God man
with a full set of balls!
Well...
Why not?
'Cause I'm not a gunfighter.
Now, don't get fact
mixed up with stupid. You...
Besides, I have nothing
against these men.
Who did you say they are?
Well, Stacey Bridges and his cousins,
the Carlin boys
they worked for the company.
They...
You know, what you
call troubleshooters.
You know, just like those three
you done in yesterday
except when they was here before,
there was lots of trouble.
And they took care of it, too.
Except, well, they got too damn
big for their britches.
Started pushing people around, and
taking over the town and we had to...
Had to what?
Well, we had to take them
into custody, that's what.
I clapped the old bracelets
on them myself.
Hey, you won't be wanting
that slab of pie, will you?
You know what happened, friend
is they stole a golden ingot out
of the mining office down there
and they hid it under the floorboard
of the shack that they lived in.
Kind of careless of them, wasn't it?
I mean, does a mining company usually
leave gold ingots lying around like that?
Well, it does seem
a bit peculiar, you know.
Matter of fact, Stacey kept bringing
that up at the trial all the time
saying that he was being
railroaded with.
And do you know that's
why they're mad at us?
No, I'll tell you what
you can do, sheriff.
What?
When those boys come back to town
you just clap the bracelets
right on them.
Me?
Well, I might have forgot to mention
that they were all three passed
out at the time, you know?
Look, I'm no lawman.
You know, they just hung
this thing on me
when that young
Marshal Duncan was killed.
You know, he was whipped to death
right here in this street.
Bullwhipped.
Damndest thing I ever saw.
Now, why would anybody want
to do a thing like that?
Well, I don't know.
It wasn't anybody
from this town, anyhow.
How do you know?
Well, this is a good town,
and these are good people.
And look, friend,
we sure would like it
if you'd help us with our problem.
Only problem you've got, sheriff,
is a short supply of guts.
You people don't need me.
Look.
Place a couple of good riflemen
on top of that building up there.
Maybe a couple more with shotguns
down behind grain bags over there.
A few more on this roof here.
Lookout up there in the bell tower.
Maybe a rifleman.
That should just about take care of it.
Well, what would it take
to see that through, you know?
The ambush.
What would it cost us?
Sheriff, I don't know if I
really like this town that much.
Well, this is a God-fearing town.
These are God-fearing people.
You like them, you save them.
Look, what if we offered
you anything you want?
Anything?
Unlimited credit.
That's what it means.
An open charge account
with no reckoning.
What His Honor's trying to say is
you got yourself a free hand
in this town, friend.
Any damn thing I want?
Go on. Help yourself.
Help yourself! Go ahead.
It's my pleasure.
Yes, sir.
Anything you want that's here
as best as we can get it
for you, we will.
Even if it's some
little squaw or a Mex
and keep your bed warm at night.
Hey, you!
Keep your sticky fingers off them
blankets if you're not buying.
And keep them kids under control.
Goddamn savages.
And besides, you know,
about handling that ambush
you know, everybody in town,
more or less, is at your orders.
Here you go.
No, no. No.
Tell him it's all right.
It's all right.
Anything I want?
Now, how's that feel?
Not bad. I'll take them.
All right, that's three pairs
of hand-stitched boots
and a tooled belt with silver buckle.
Let's see, that'll be,
five and two, carry the nine
and that comes to exactly...
No charge.
Come on, now.
I'd like to get all these
people a drink.
Yes, sir. One round for the house.
There you are.
This gentleman here's buying
a round for the house.
No fair. No fair. I ordered one, too.
Don't I get a glass of beer?
You get a glass of beer, right there.
Coming up.
There we are.
Now, that's one round
for the house, sir.
Anything else?
Get yourself something.
Thank you very kindly, sir.
I'll have a cigar.
And smoke it later.
Now, including the smoke,
that comes to about $8,50.
There's no charge, Lutie.
You was at the meeting.
Anything he wants
in this town, he gets.
You voted on it.
I didn't know that meant free whiskey.
Well, everybody's got to put
something in the kitty, right?
Right.
About time this town
had a new sheriff.
I'm the sheriff?
I'm the sheriff.
I'm sorry, Sam.
But you looked so comical when
he put your badge on the runt.
I'm not a runt anymore.
I'm the sheriff.
And the mayor.
And I'm the mayor.
Any objections?
No. No, that's fine.
I'm the mayor. I'm the sheriff.
No more, "Mordecai, bring the water."
"Mordecai, take the laundry.
Clean up the mess."
Hot damn!
I'm gonna declare a holiday.
Hot damn!
Wait a minute.
I can't be a sheriff
if I don't have a gun.
Is this about the size gun
you're looking for?
No, that one. That'll do.
Whatever this gent wants,
he's to have.
That's orders of Mr. Drake
and Mr. Allen.
I want every man in the regiment
to have one of these nice rifles.
What regiment?
The city of Lago volunteers.
Never heard of them.
Why, you ought to, you're in it.
So are you, you,
and all of you out there.
I want you all out in the street
in 10 minutes for drill.
Well, that's that.
Bridges, you Carlin boys
don't forget your tickets
back here to my little hotel.
And don't worry.
They ain't loaded.
What about our horses?
We had three good animals.
What do you think you've been
eating the last six months?
Damn him! Dog, I didn't
eat my own horse!
That slop he fed us wasn't our horses.
He just stole them
and sold them to somebody.
- That's what he done!
- Shut up.
- Well, that's what he done!
- Shut up.
When we get to Lago,
you can have the mayor's horse.
Fried or barbecued.
Well, I guess we walk some.
Old Drake and Allen don't seem
to have remembered.
They'll remember.
One way or another, they'll remember.
All right.
You don't wanna get shot.
You don't want your shops
or your houses burned.
You don't want your women touched.
You don't want anything to happen.
Except you're afraid
to do anything about it.
Or you don't know how.
Shit.
Fire! Fire!
Come on, fire!
I don't remember lending my wagons
to be shot up by these
goddamn fools out here.
You know, you're gonna
look awfully silly
with that knife sticking up your ass.
Fire! Pull those triggers!
Come on, shoot!
Shoot!
Aim! Fire!
You still here?
No. No, I was... I was just going.
Damn! Can you do that every time?
Damn right he can.
We're not gonna have a thing
in the world to worry about.
This is gonna be a picnic!
All right, keep them after us?
Go on, out there.
You men carpenters?
Sí, señor. We do rough fixing.
Could you make some tables, big ones
that a lot of people could sit?
Like for a church picnic?
Exactly.
Well, you could use sawhorses
and one-by-twelves.
Could you have them ready
for me by tomorrow morning?
If we have the lumber.
You'll have the lumber.
Come on with me.
You really planning a picnic?
Any objection?
No, just it's the damndest thing
I ever heard of.
You haven't heard the funny part.
What's that?
You're furnishing
the beer and whiskey.
Preacher.
Good morning, brother Belding.
Mrs. Lake was just asking about you.
How is the dear old soul?
She's chipper as a jaybird.
I don't know how she does it.
Well, she's got the strength
of her faith, brother Belding.
Praise God.
The strength of her faith.
Too bad about your barn.
Termites?
There's nothing wrong with my barn.
It's sound as a dollar.
Then how come those
two Mexs is tearing it down?
What?
What do you greasy bastards
think you're doing to my barn?
Exactly what I told them.
We're requisitioning
your barn, Belding.
Any objection?
You men can go back to work.
Would you mind telling me
what the hell's going on here?
And you can help out, too.
You mean, you want me
to help you tear down my barn?
Wait a minute.
Maybe he'd be better use
if he'd help us collect the few
little items we're still missing.
Items? What items? What for?
You got the list, sheriff.
Read it to him.
We still need 35 bedsheets
one barbecued steer
and 200 gallons of red paint.
Red paint?
We're counting on you
for the bedsheets.
Is there anything else?
Yes, there is.
How long is it gonna take you to get
everybody out of your hotel?
What?
Everybody out.
How long is it gonna take?
Why, I just can't...
I mean, I got eight people living
in rooms up there in my hotel.
Now, I just...
Where are they gonna go?
Out.
You know better than to walk
in a man's camp and...
What the hell is going on?
Well, Stacey, looks like
we got three fresh horses.
Wait a while.
He's got him some snappy duds.
Faster!
Fire! Pull that trigger!
Go on!
Go on!
Shoot!
Pull that trigger!
Fire!
Any improvement?
Some.
You know, Lew and I were thinking,
maybe we were a little
hasty in our decision.
What do you mean?
Well, maybe we don't need any
outside help to solve our problem.
Hell, Dave, maybe we don't
even have a problem.
Every man who ever got sent up
went away saying he's gonna
come back and get even, right?
But think about it.
Can you actually remember anyone ever
coming back and doing anything?
I can't think of one. Can you?
The point being, you want to get
rid of the gunfighter. Is that it?
Now, Dave, we got to
before it's too late.
He's making a mock
of this whole town.
Making that little dwarf the sheriff.
Kicking my own people
out of my own hotel.
Got half of the women in town
sewing bedsheets together.
They're my bedsheets!
Got those Mexicans down there
building long picnic tables.
Lutie Naylor, down there
barbecuing a whole damn steer.
Some kind of a picnic.
Right here in our own town.
Sounds pretty good to me.
What do you mean?
I mean, it sounds like a good idea
bringing everything out
in the open so we can see it.
Don't you see what we're saying?
This whole thing's all for nothing.
They're probably
all three blind drunk
in some Nogales whorehouse right now.
Well, if they're dead drunk in
Nogales, we'll know in 24 hours.
Surely we can put up
with the man for one more day.
No. I say no.
He's got this whole town so people
are beginning to turn on each other.
What's the matter, Morgan?
Anybody special turn on you?
You want to spell that out, Drake?
Spell it yourself.
I'm not gonna jeopardize
everything I've built here
because some blond bitch
and he threw you out of bed.
God damn you!
Don't talk to me that way.
I'll talk to you any way I like!
I'll say anything I have to say
as long as I'm running this company.
Well, say it, but you could listen
once in a while yourself, you know.
What's the matter, Morgan?
You're not getting your
fair share of the profits?
Profits. It's not the profits.
It's just that this whole
business has gone sour
since that deal with that
former Marshal Duncan.
Wait a minute, we had no choice
in that matter, and you know it.
Come on! Wait a minute...
The big mistake we made was hiring
that man Duncan in the first place
- ...and you did that all by yourself.
- All by myself?
Quiet. Shut up.
We can trust one another.
Guys, please...
This whole town had
a hand in what happened.
Hell, why do you think Stacey
Bridges and the Carlin brothers
kept their mouths shut all this time?
Same reason everybody
else did in this town.
One hang, we all hang.
Now, you just grit
your teeth a little bit longer.
The gunfighter stays
till I say otherwise.
You understand?
Well, there it is, just like he said.
That stranger's got everybody
turning on everybody.
Being put out after all these years.
That man!
Right here.
Okay, folks, put your bags right
here in the wagon.
All right, folks, just put your bags
right here in the wagon.
Right here.
What's going on here?
What the hell does it look
like is going on, preacher?
They're emptying my whole hotel.
Throwing out paying guests,
right into the street
just to make room for our
new guardian angel.
He likes to be by himself,
more or less.
You see who's running our town now?
He's sitting right
over there, Mr. Belding.
If you don't like it
why don't you just go over there
and tell him that he can't?
Mordecai someday soon
someone's going to step
on your scrawny little
neck, you lizard
and when they do, you're going to be
nothing but a squished monster.
See here
you can't turn all these
people out into the night.
It is inhuman, brother.
Inhuman!
I'm not your brother.
We are all brothers
in the eyes of God.
All these people, are they
your sisters and brothers?
They most certainly are.
Then you won't mind if they come over
and stay at your place, will you?
All right, folks, let's go!
Put your bags up here! Let's hurry up!
Friends, friends, don't worry.
We shall find haven
for you in our own homes.
And it won't cost you one cent
more than regular hotel rates.
Paid up, that's ridiculous.
My room ready?
Two connecting rooms,
the best in the hotel.
One for entertaining your
many new friends in town
and one for sleeping.
If your conscience lets you sleep.
I sleep just fine, ma'am.
Is that so?
You care to see for yourself?
You tell Mrs. Belding
there'll be two for supper.
I like chicken, fried.
And anything else?
Best bottle of wine in town.
Remember, he won't be
around forever, you little...
Marshal.
Somebody, please help me.
What are you doing?
Let go of me! You've got
to stop this! Not now!
Let go of me!
Damn you all to hell.
How did you get in here?
You had your chance
and you missed it.
You're hurting me.
What do you want?
Just a little pleasant
female company for supper.
- You know what you are?
- What?
You're an animal.
Well, you have a way
of bringing that out.
No, thank you,
but I don't eat with dogs.
You might, if it's the dog
that runs the pack.
Give me a half an hour to get ready.
You're ready right now.
I could be readier.
Half an hour.
You know, actually, I eat like a bird.
I've got it.
I knew that old bastard Hobart had
it in a hole under the store.
Look. But I've got it.
All the way from France.
Would you stick a bent knife in that,
get the cork out?
Do you have any special
request for dessert?
No, I've already taken care of that.
Can't fix that without
a blacksmith or a vet.
Maybe both.
Hell, we'll find neither one out here.
Well, I'll tell you something, Stace.
I think we've been pushing too hard.
I mean, like as not,
all three of these horses
could have come up lame.
Hell, I feel pretty lame myself
not being on a horse 12
months in that damn jail.
Back off, Cole.
Maybe we ought to leave you
and the horse here.
Well, now, Stace,
I didn't mean nothing.
Hell, Stacey, he can ride double with
me until we come across somebody.
We'll all need fresh animals.
All right! Quit crying about it.
I'll tell you what, though.
Soon as they find
those bodies back there
they're gonna have
a hunting party out for us.
And I want time to take
one year of my life out of Lago
before we move on.
How long is that gonna take,
you figure?
A lifetime for some of them.
You're out late, Mordecai.
...and fornication
and sins of the flesh.
That's what's going on under my roof
right now while I'm talking to you.
That stranger has taken
over my whole hotel
and thrown good, honest,
decent folk right out into the night.
Well, why didn't you stop him, Lewis?
You've got a gun.
You shut your fat mouth, Sam.
We're tired of giving you money
for doing an incompetent job!
Don't you talk to me that way!
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!
Please! Look at us!
Sweet God, look
what's happening to us.
That's right.
It's just like the preacher says.
That stranger's got everybody
in this town at each other's throats.
He's set himself up like a king!
He's got you all snake fascinated,
every damn one of you!
This crazy picnic.
200 gallons of blood-red paint.
It couldn't be worse if the devil
himself had ridden right into Lago.
Welcome to Lago, you son of a bitch.
Get out of here!
They're here, father!
I'm sorry.
Morg!
Where are you going?
Morg, Morg, take me with you!
Morg? Morg, you better
take me with you.
Morg, where are you going?
Morg! Morg!
Don't leave me here!
He'll kill me!
Get off my cuffs. Let's go!
No.
My beautiful hotel.
They promised me that they wouldn't...
Ruined.
A total loss.
Didn't even touch my store.
Look, I want you to watch
that pilfering.
You know, I hold you
responsible, sheriff.
- I'm not your goddamn sheriff.
- You!
Say, I'll need one, two...
Two up there.
I'll need four boxes from you
and shovels from you,
so these people can dig the holes.
Well, yes...
But I thought perhaps we could...
Right now.
All right, everyone.
Was you here?
I mean, did you see anything?
Somebody left the door open,
and the wrong dogs came home.
Well...
Get the shovel, will you?
I hope you're not gonna blame us
for Morgan Allen's stupidity.
Because the rest of us here
have an agreement with you.
Well, right now I don't feel
too agreeable.
Well, maybe a little bonus will make
you a little more appreciative.
How little?
500 a head.
500 an ear?
Done. Done.
$3000?
You promised that son of a bitch $3000
after what he did to my hotel?
Promising's one thing.
Paying's another.
He may just catch a bullet.
You and Lewis can grab shovels, too.
I knew you were cruel, but I didn't
know how far you could go.
Well, you still don't.
Well, it doesn't matter to you.
I don't know where
you're gonna sleep now.
Bodies everywhere.
All the rooms are ruined
except for our room.
Wait. Wait a minute.
No.
No. No.
No, let go, let go! Lewis!
Lewis, don't just stand there.
Let go of me! Let go!
Stop! Look, you don't need me.
Let go! Let go!
Let go of me!
What are you gonna do with those?
Defend myself.
Against what?
It's no secret what
you did to Callie Travers.
Did?
The other day in the stable.
As I recall, she enjoyed
that quite a bit.
I promise you, I won't.
Well, you flatter yourself, lady.
I flatter myself?
I'd love to oblige you, but a man's
got to get his rest sometime.
Oblige me?
But I'll tell you what.
If you come back in about a half-hour
I'll see what I can do, all right?
Why, you low-down,
stinking, son of a...
Have you ever heard
the name Jim Duncan?
I've heard a lot of things. Why?
He was town marshal here.
He's lying out there
in an unmarked grave.
They say the dead don't rest
without a marker of some kind.
Do you believe that?
What makes you think I care?
I don't know.
He's the reason this town's
afraid of strangers.
I was going to warn you about that.
Pretty funny.
What's funny?
You ask me that in a blown-up hotel
with seven dead men
to your credit already?
I was just stopping
by for a bottle of whiskey
and a nice hot bath.
All right. If you say so.
You don't believe me?
Mister, whatever you say
is fine with me.
Be careful.
You're a man who makes people
afraid, and that's dangerous.
Well, it's what people know
about themselves inside
that makes them afraid.
I don't know if we shouldn't
mark the grave somehow.
Sam?
I don't see any need.
Ain't likely that anybody's
gonna cry over them anyhow.
You know what to do.
Yes, sir, captain.
All right!
Everybody grab a brush and start in.
You mean, you want
the whole place painted?
Everything.
You can't possibly mean
the church, too.
I mean especially the church.
All right, I'll paint if you say
we've got to
but when we get done,
this place is gonna look like hell.
Hello, Lewis.
I want you to go to that
meeting with me, Sarah.
It's very important.
No.
Not now, not ever.
They are still your neighbors!
Yes, they're my neighbors,
and they make me sick.
Hiding behind words like
"faith", "peace" and "trust."
Good words. Damn good words.
But we hid a murder behind them.
Won't you never understand, woman?
It wasn't anything we wanted to do.
When Duncan found out the mine
was on government property
it was just a technicality, really
but he was determined to turn us in.
Wouldn't listen to reason.
Is that why?
Is that really why it happened?
Don't you see, Sarah?
They would have closed down the mine!
Do you know what would've
happened to this town then?
It would've been the end of
everything that we've worked on.
All of it, all of us!
And you, too, wife.
Now, sometimes we have
to do what's necessary to do
for the good of everybody.
That's the price of progress.
And what's the price
of a human life, Lewis?
Ask your good friends
if they know that.
Your damn conscience.
I'll say, it's sure taken a hell
of a while to bother you.
I'm packing to leave, Lewis.
I won't be coming back.
That's Morg Allen,
or what's left of him.
Well, now, what's he doing,
riding around here like that?
He's come back to pay us back for some
jail time that was rightfully his.
Only he don't know it yet.
Stacey, help me.
My arm. Help me.
Help me, Stacey.
I'm curious, Morg.
You helped them rail road us
and you've got the balls to come
down here and ask us for a favor?
Goddamn if I don't admire you.
Do something about my arm, Stacey.
Well, I am doing something, Morg.
Sitting here watching
you bleed to death.
Stacey, things have changed in Lago.
You need me.
I gotta tell you about it.
From the looks of your arm, Morg
it looks like you've run your
welcome out in Lago, and ours, too.
What me and the boys want to know
is how we're gonna pick up
12 months' back pay
and everything else that's owed us.
Stacey, for God's sakes!
No, no. For our sake.
Now you can help us, all right,
and you can help yourself, too.
Now you just give me the combination
to that big iron box
in the back of your office
and me and the boys will just
Sneak right in there
real quiet-like, take what's
ours, bring you the rest
or leave it there safe and sound,
that's up to you.
First, of course,
we'll fix up your arm
set you over there in the shade
with a nice canteen full of water.
You no-good,
worthless son of a bitch.
You're probably right about that.
Give me that combination, Morg.
I wouldn't give you the combination
to the gates of hell.
Dog!
Sure had a lot of blood
left in him, didn't he?
Two sticks of dynamite will take
care of that iron box, anyway.
We don't need him.
Dan, you hit?
I don't know.
I don't think so.
Damn near tore my leg off!
Who the hell is that?
Must be Dave Drake.
What the hell did you hit?
Keep shooting, damn it!
He shot my ear off!
Somebody up there's playing games.
He shot my ear off!
Well, he could've shot
your whole damn head off!
Now get down!
Dave, is that you?
Come on out! We'll settle this.
Morg was almost dead,
anyway, from that arm!
I just put him out of his misery!
I'll kill you!
You son of a bitch, I'll kill you!
Come down out of there, you bastard!
I'll cut your heart out!
Let's go up there, Stacey.
There might be some more dynamite.
I'll get him.
I'll get him, whoever it was up there.
I'll kill every man in Lago!
The guests are on their
way to the party
so gather all the people together.
Right, captain!
All right, men, get that sign up!
Come on! They're coming!
All right, everybody, come on!
Get a little move on!
I want you up in that tower.
First sign of dust,
you ring the bell, you hear?
Are you sure this
is gonna be all right?
It's gonna be all right.
He's back! He's here.
It's time to get ready.
What's the matter with everybody?
Wait till we gun them down.
Bang, bang, bang!
All right, everybody,
I think we're expected outside.
I just hope that shooter we hired
is feeling up to snuff.
Don't worry. He'll be fine.
Let's go.
Hey, señor, can we come to the fiesta?
No.
I want everybody
to have plenty of those.
Hey, ain't it about time
we got out there?
There's plenty of time.
But they'll be here any damn minute.
I think Sam's right. We ought to.
What about after?
What about after we do it?
What do we do then?
Then you live with it.
Where you gonna be?
Are you gonna take the first shot?
Are you gonna get
Stacey Bridges first?
Or maybe you're gonna
get all three by yourself?
When are you gonna give the signal?
I'm not. You are.
You old people, move out of here!
Here they come!
Come on!
Fire!
Fire! Fire!
Get them.
Don't shoot me. Don't! Don't.
A party? A party?
Welcome home party?
Well, here's to your party.
Give me another bottle.
Give me another bottle!
Well, now the party's over.
- Stace!
- Let go of me!
Look what I found in the bushes.
Look what I found in the bushes!
Stacey, it was always you.
That's why Morg Allen hated you.
He knew how much I loved you.
I bet you just cried yourself
to sleep every night
thinking about me
in that territorial prison.
But I did. I really did!
Well, I can see it all now.
You lying there in Morg Allen's bed,
just a-crying and a-humping.
No, no!
Give me that bottle.
Cole, go and get the horses ready.
You got it, Stace.
Stacey. Stacey, you're gonna
take me with you, aren't you?
I can do better than you
in a four-bit fancy house.
You still here?
God damn right I'm still here.
I wanna know who them sons
of bitches was that ambushed us.
That's what I'd like to know.
That's what we're gonna
find out right now.
Who are you?
Don't hit me.
Don't hit me, please!
Please, don't hit me.
Please, stop!
Please, don't hit me! Please!
Come on, Stacey.
Let's get out of here.
Shut up.
Okay, everybody out.
Everybody out!
Out!
Come on, move!
Go on. Get out!
Move!
Go on.
Move!
Hurry up in there. Move!
Move!
Hold up there! Get in there!
Hold it right there!
- Dynamite!
- Dynamite!
Stacey, the goddamn horses are gone.
Go on. Go on!
Help me.
Help me.
Who are you?
Who are you?
I'm just about done here.
I never did know your name.
Yes, you do.
Take care.
Yes, sir, captain.
