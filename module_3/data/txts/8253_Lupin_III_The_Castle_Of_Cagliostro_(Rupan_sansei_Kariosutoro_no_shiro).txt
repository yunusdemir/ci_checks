Stop!
Get them!
THANKS!
Five billion with
nonsequential serial numbers.
It's a shower of money!
Ya-hoo!
Whoa! Yow
Come on. Bury me in it.
What's wrong
- Dump it.
- What?
This is counterfeit.
Excellent quality too.
All this?
No way. We heisted this
from the vault of the national casino.
- Goat bills.
- Goat bills?
You mean
the legendary counterfeits?
So they've made their way
into the national casinos now.
Jigen! I've decided
what our next job will be.
Why don't we have a little
pre-victory celebration?
Darn it! Darn it! Darn it!

The Duchy of Cagliostro.
Never heard of it.
Population: 3500.
The world's smallest member
state of the United Nations.
And this is the source
of the Goat bills
It's a famous legend
in the underworld.
This is the black hole of
the counterfeiting world.
Black hole?
No one who's gone in looking
around here has ever come back.
Oh
I'm so scared I need a nap.
Hey!
Jeez!
This spare's totally bald.
Peaceful
- What the-
- Get in!
- Which are we helping?
- The girl!
Typical.
- Get the tires.
- Gotcha.
Damn!
That's no ordinary car.
Yow! Well
Going up!
Got 'em!
This time I won't use
an ordinary bullet.
All right!
She's fainted.
- It's coming apart.
- Take the wheel.
- No
Down! Look down!
Yeah
Hello?
Hello?
Forgive me.
Hey
- Jeez
Damn it!
Who are those guys and
why are they after that girl?
- It's a ring
What's wrong?
When you saw that ring
Hey
The same crest
that was on the ring. Lupin?
Abandoned
Fire
- Who's there?
- Just some passers-by.
- Tourists?
- You could say that.
I was under the impression that
this was the grand duke's palace
It still is
This is the grand duke's palace?
It's just a burnt-out shell.
There was a fire seven years ago.
The duke and his wife
were lost in it.
Since then
That's strange. The grand duke
was like your king
Does that mean
you don't have a king now?
There's a regent. They say
there's nothing to be concerned about.
- Now hurry up and leave.
- Right.
Hey
She's grown.
- Something wrong?
- Quit playing dumb.
Pulling that "I'm a cool
- Now talk!
- No. No!
- Gonna talk?
- I'll talk!
The castle of
Count Cagliostro
Look over there.
No
Past the aqueduct.
That boat from before!
The bride's in that castle.
There's the floodgate over there.
It hasn't changed at all.
You've broken
into that castle before?
That was more than 10 years ago.
I was looking for the secret
of the Goat bills.
I was still a young punk
And? What happened?
I got my butt royally kicked!
Had to run away with
my tail between my legs.
I didn't think
they used autogyros anymore.
It's the Count.
C'mon. Let's find a room
for the night.
Hey!
- You were careless
It happened while they were
fitting the bridal gown.
She escaped when the men
left her alone in the room.
She's in the north tower now?
Yes
- Foreigners?
- Yes
Two men.
They helped her to escape.
Find them
and take care of them.
The ring's gone.
Summon Jodo!
This inscription's in Capran
Capran?
"When light and shadow are joined
once more
AD 1517.
The date's in Roman numerals.
So that ring's 400 years old.
- Sorry for the wait.
- Looks great!
What is it
that you are looking at?
Oh
I was wondering
if it was worth anything.
Oh
Clarisse?
Look
See that photo?
It was taken when she was a child.
She just came back
from the convent yesterday.
- I'll bet she's really beautiful now.
- Convent?
Don't you know about it?
I thought you both were here to see
Lady Clarisse marry the Count.
Oh
Still
The Count's known for
being a real playboy.
Oh
One of the Count's men.
His eyes lit up
when he saw that ring.
Just having the bride isn't enough.
They want the ring too
Oh
You knew that girl this afternoon was
the grand duke's daughter
Oh
"When light and shadow are joined
once more
Do you think it's a treasure
that'll be restored?
Oh-ho!
The gang's all here!
Why
My Magnum has no effect!
These guys are professional killers.
Move it!
They had me worried for a while.
They actually launched
a full-scale attack on us.
There's more to this case
than meets the eye.
Things are really gettin'
interesting now.
This batch isn't very well made.
The quality's just
getting worse
Forgive me
But it's unavoidable if we continue
to mass-produce them like we are.
Redo them. However
Who's there?
Jodo
For the first time ever
Jodo
What the-
When did he-
Lupin!
It's Lupin's calling card.
- Read it.
- Yes
Just do it.
Yes
I shall take your bride.
The day I will come is near."
Signed
It's good news
Why don't we wait for this man
Lupin to come to us?
Hi
What's the job?
Goemon's arrived.
So has someone else.
Take a look.
What?
That's a Japanese police car.
- It's Zenigata.
- What?
Everybody out!
Form up!
And now the players
are all in place.
Ow
Forgive me
for interrupting your meal.
I am Zenigata of Interpol.
We've received a report that you've
gotten one of Lupin's calling cards.
You no doubt mean the grandson
of that common thief
Is Interpol in the habit of interrupting
peoples' breakfasts for such matters?
Your Excellency
If he says he's coming
Your wedding is in five days.
Until then
We have police in this country too.
Although we have the refinement
to refer to them as the "royal guard."
You summoned me
Gustav
- You may leave.
- Yes
Your Excellency
Will you please tell me why
Lupin would be after your bride?
Who knows?
Isn't finding that out your job?
If you'll excuse me.
Is it wise to have that man
inside the castle
It doesn't matter. I have many
friends in Interpol as well.
They'll be leaving soon.
Good ol' Zenigata.
The archetypical Japanese man.
Totally devoted to his work.
What's that over there?
Don't go any further.
- What?
- Observe.
If you don't wish to die
Tell your men that too.
Inspector. I'm picking up
anti-personnel radar here too.
I've got a bad feeling
about this castle.
There are too many security systems
here for a normal man to have.
A woman?
Oh
Yeah
You're saying that ring has
something to do with it?
We'll find that out when we grab the
girl from that dirty old man
Anyway
but between your sword
and this anti-tank rifle-
Hey
- You figured out a way in yet?
- Nope.
That place is incredible.
A nest of lasers and radar.
I see.
We may even need a tank.
That's why you called in
Zenigata
What? Is that true
Exactly!
You've got good intuition.
Use poison to fight poison
This is Cagliostro Castle.
This is where we are.
This Roman aqueduct here
is still in use.
It's the only way in.
The aqueduct brings water from
this lake into the castle.
I get it. And there won't be
any lasers in the water
Goemon. Stay on watch here.
Careful. There's a hole.
The first obstacle
Let's go.
Lupin!
Whew! This must be the
machinery room for the clock.
I wonder if that SOB
actually made it.
What's that windmill for?
Gustav said they use it
to bring water up into the castle.
- And where does the water come out?
- A fountain on the upper cannon deck.
- Come on!
- Yes
Inspector!
We just received orders from
Paris HQ. "Pull out at once."
What? That's ridiculous!
I'll see about that.
What? But we got a warning
that Lupin was coming
The Count?
I'm a cop
Hello? Hello?
Oh
I'll talk to the Count about this.
Show me to the Count.
I need to see the Count at once.
Didn't you hear me?
Let me through!
Stop it.
Only trusted people are
allowed past this point.
What? Are you saying
Interpol officers can't be trusted?
I believe you've received
orders to pull out.
I must ask you to leave.
How did you know about that?
We won't need any of you Orientals
to help us with Lupin. Now go.
Oh
Was I just here?
- What?
- You idiot! That was Lupin!
He disguised himself as me
so he could sneak in here!
Couldn't a muscle-bound idiot
like you see through that getup?
Why
Don't let Lupin get away!
Hold it!
Lupin?
Cut it out! It's Lupin!
Save the Inspector!
Charge!
Wow
Cut it out! He's Lupin!
Darn it!
Lupin!
Looks like we caught someone.
That fool. He should have left
as soon as he could.
- The guards are gone.
- Gustav!
What's he doing
- You stay here.
- Yes
Sorry
You fool!
Stop this uproar at once!
Don't you understand?
Lupin did this to sneak in.
Why
Let go. Let go of me!
So that devil Lupin
made it in after all.
I have no excuse
Tell the inspector's men that
he went home ahead of them.
It's not unheard of for people
to vanish while traveling
Don't move.
- Good evening
There's nothing lovelier than a woman
who's absorbed in her work.
So you made it in this far.
That's all you say after a year apart?
You wound me
And after I looked all over for you.
Lupin
Oh
I'll tell you where she is
I won't!
I'd never dream of it.
I wonder about that.
She's being held
at the top of the north tower.
Although it's impossible to get into.
Lupin?
Damn
- Who's there?
- A thief.
A thief?
Good evening
You! You're the man who-
You forgot something.
You came here just for this?
But if the Count finds you
No matter. To hunt and be hunted
is the nature of being a thief.
I will leave once
I've finished my job.
Your job?
I wish I had something to give you
Here. Take this.
What I seek is a treasure...
which an evil sorcerer
has locked inside a high tower.
Will you allow this humble thief
to please steal it away?
You mean me?
Like I save precious gems which
have been locked away in a vault...
I have come to take a girl
forced to be a bride against her will...
and set her free
in the green fields outside.
This all goes with being a thief.
You've come to set me free?
Thank you.
I appreciate what you're doing.
But you don't know the terrible
secrets of the Cagliostro family.
Please just leave me and go.
Oh
The girl believes in the
power of the evil sorcerer...
yet she doesn't believe
in the power of the thief.
Oh
the thief would be able
to fly through the air!
He would be able drink
all the water in the lake!
For now
Mr. Thief!
Hey!
Treat the lady gently
Thank you so much for
returning the ring
Well
I'm afraid
you're going to disappear now.
But can you really
make me vanish so easily?
Stop it!
Don't hurt that man!
I'll be fine
Mr. Thief!
Yup
Well
It would be simple
to just rip you apart.
However
by the blood of a common thief.
I'll make you regret
that you ever said that.
Enough of your insolence.
That hole leads to a hell
not one person has ever escaped from.
That pretty face has already
lured a man to his doom.
You can't deny the
Cagliostro blood inside of you.
You'll make
a most fitting wife for me.
Murderer!
You aren't human.
You're right.
My hands have blood on them
as do your own.
The family of the Count has always served
in the shadow of the grand duke's.
Performing its plots and assassinations.
Supporting this country.
Let me go!
You're disgusting.
Don't pretend you don't know.
You
Within your body
Clarisse
but now the two houses of
Cagliostro will be reunited.
Look.
When the gold goat that
marks my house is joined...
with the silver goat
of your house...
the treasure hidden by our ancestors
will be restored.
<i>I heard him!</i>
- <i>He's marrying her to get the treasure.</i>
- It's him!
<i>The counterfeiting Count.</i>
<i>Everything he says or does is fake!</i>
<i>That girl happens to be</i>
<i>a sweet
- Mr. Thief?
- <i>Yup! I'm just fine.</i>
Since the girl believed in me
Mr. Thief is coming
to steal you away.
- <i>Wait for me
<i>Damn it
Give me that.
<i>Okay
<i>I've got the real ring.</i>
<i>If you lay one finger on that girl
It's a fake!
Why
You really do
treat people like crap!
- Did he fall?
- Probably.
Make sure.
Down there
isn't a place for the living.
If we leave him alone
- He still has the ring.
- As you wish
Just wait.
I'll bring your dear thief
back to you in pieces!
Killing and killing for 400 years.
Rest in peace
MARCH 14
SPY FOR THE JAPANESE ARMY
Lupin!
Why
Old Man
Tell me. Where's the exit?
How did you get in here?
I fell in
You look like you've been
walking around for a long time.
Shut up!
I won't take pity from a thief.
Well
'Scuse me
Hey
Lupin
Take a look at that wall.
Th-This is-
Rest in peace.
I thought there was something
suspicious about this castle...
but what sort of secret is worth
this much trouble to hide?
Hey
That's what Fujiko's after.
I hope she doesn't end up
like these bodies in here.
Anyway
Good night
It's cold!
Man
Still no movement.
Then I guess we just wait.
They're taking too long.
Mr. Jodo!
They've found it!
Heave-ho!
Curse you
These are coffins.
What is all this?
These are Japanese 10
These are really well-made.
Hey
West German 1
Pounds. Dollars.
Francs. Rubles. Rupees.
Pesos. Crowns. Lira.
They've even got won!
It's the whole world in here.
They're making counterfeits.
Lupin
Exactly. This is the
source of the counterfeits...
that were supposedly better
than the originals: The Goat bills.
<i>The counterfeit money</i>
<i>which inevitably moved...</i>
<i>in the shadow of the upheavals</i>
<i>of medieval Europe.</i>
<i>It caused the collapse</i>
<i>of the Bourbon dynasty...</i>
<i>became Napoleon's</i>
<i>source of funding...</i>
<i>and eventually triggered</i>
<i>the world bank panic of 1927.</i>
<i>Appearing</i>
<i>on the backstage ofhistory...</i>
<i>as the star of the black hole:</i>
<i>The Goat bills.</i>
<i>Of all the people who came here</i>
<i>looking for their source...</i>
<i>not a single one of them</i>
<i>ever returned.</i>
I've heard rumors about this...
but who'd ever believe an
independent nation was running it?
What're you gonna do
After seeing this
I know!
It makes my cop's blood burn.
How about a truce
until we get out of here?
Very well
And after we're out of here
It's settled
- I won't be corrupted.
- Corrupted?
- Miss Fujiko.
- The time's come to say good bye.
Who are you?
To all appearances
who is employed here
in the castle as your servant.
But in reality
I was hoping to stay a little longer
Everything's fallen apart
You know that man?
Only too well.
Sometimes we're allies
Occasionally
The guy's a natural born lady-killer.
Watch out.
He walked out on you?
Oh
There's smoke coming
from the trapdoor.
A fire?
It's coming from underground.
- Movement.
- He's started.
Fire! Fire!
Trouble! A fire's started in
the underground printing plant.
- What? Put it out at once!
- Yes
Close that blasted door!
The rest of you
Damn you
Hurry up
Evidence. I need evidence!
Curse you
Look for them!
They may still be in here.
Have no fear! Forward!
It's Lupin. After him!
You put out the fire.
The chapel!
- Mr. Thief!
- Lupin. And Zenigata?
They're trying to steal
the autogyro!
- <i>You fool!</i>
- You can punish me later.
They're trying to take
Lady Clarisse. Hurry!
Hurry up!
Halt!
Why
Old Man
So long!
Old Man
I will not cooperate
in a kidnapping for ransom.
This isn't business.
They're coming this way.
Bulletproof glass!
We can't open it.
Please just leave me!
- Old Man
I can't fly this thing!
- Clarisse?
- Mr. Thief!
Your ride's here.
Fujiko
Quit bossing me around!
Miss Fujiko!
Hurry!
- Mr. Thief!
- Okay
Old Man! This way!
What do you think
I'm trying to do
Okay
Lupin!
Don't move
Fujiko
- Jodo
No! Don't shoot!
If you kill him
Fire.
I admire your devotion
Get the ring back
and come here.
Become my wife
and I will let Lupin live.
Or you can both die here together.
The choice is yours.
Mr. Thief
No
Under his collar.
Lupin always hides things there.
Darn it
I have the ring.
Let this man and Fujiko go
You have my word.
Now put the ring on and come here.
- Shall I shoot?
- Wait until we have the ring.
Lupin!
Shoot!
Don't let them escape!
Liar!
You said you'd let them go.
Let them go after they've seen
the underground plant?
At last
Lupin
We didn't even get to join in
Oh
Once again
Lupin! Don't you dare die
before I get to arrest you!
Whatever we do
It's some sort of plot.
Give the order for us to go in!
Look how clear all this evidence is.
I saw it myself.
The latest printing equipment
We understand that!
This is a high-level
political problem...
and Interpol's jurisdiction is
limited to international crime.
Chief
You don't understand.
The one committing it is an independent
member of the United Nations.
Even Interpol can't conduct
a forcible criminal investigation.
Besides that
Have you seen the pictures on the
front pages of the world's newspapers?
"Count bravely defends his bride!
Lupin's attempt to kidnap
Princess Clarisse fails!"
Along with reports of a henchman
disguised as Zenigata.
That was really me!
Wasn't that a bit rash
for an officer in your position?
The truth has to be told!
The problem is whether
world opinion will believe you.
There's no way we can win.
The Count has many friends among
the Western governments
The truth may cause trouble
for a lot of nations.
Yes
counterfeit dollars were
ordered by a certain country!
And these counterfeit rubles
weren't ordered by the CIA?
Gentlemen
You will not bring your countries'
quarrels into these chambers!
The only way to deal with this...
is for each country to
come up with its own solution!
Inspector
We can leave for Cagliostro
at any time.
We won't be moving out.
As soon as they choose my replacement
All of you
<i>It's me.</i>
- Food.
- Thanks.
- How is he?
- His fever seems to have dropped.
Thanks to the treatment
you gave him.
If you want to thank anyone
That old dog doesn't like anyone
If not for that
Hello
He's awake.
Lupin
Jigen. Goemon.
It's been a while.
A while?
What's he talking about?
I think his wounds have
temporarily confused his memory.
Karl
How do you know
that dog's name?
The only other person besides me
who knows it's Karl is Princess Clarisse.
Clarisse?
So your owner's name is Clarisse.
Clarisse...
Lupin?
Jigen! How many days?
How many days has it been?
Uh
What? That means
the wedding's tomorrow.
I have to-
Don't push yourself.
You'll reopen your wounds.
Food. Bring me food.
Food?
Some porridge
I've lost a lot of blood.
Anything'll do. Bring me a feast.
Well
I'll see what I can do.
You damn fool!
Don't eat so fast.
Your body can't take that much.
Shut up! Gimme 12 hours
and I'll be as fit as a jet plane!
See? I told you so.
Need a wash basin?
What?
He says now he'll sleep.
I see.
He did it for Princess Clarisse.
But now that
Lupin's hurt this badly-
You seem to be connected with
Miss Clarisse from the past
I tended the palace gardens.
Princess Clarisse
loved plants as a child.
When her family died and
she was sent off to the convent...
she gave me this dog.
He must have smelled the
princess's scent on Lupin's body.
But
I dunno. Lupin can be charmed
by women really easily
- It wasn't like that.
- What
It happened 10 years ago.
I was a young hotshot kid
who was just starting out on his own.
<i>I acted like an idiot.</i>
<i>To top it all off
<i>Somehow
Karl? What's wrong
<i>I thought my number</i>
<i>had finally come up.</i>
Water.
As her trembling hands
gave me the water...
I noticed a ring on her finger
I'm ashamed to say this...
but until I saw the ring again
That was Fujiko's bike.
It's a clipping from today's paper.
"An archbishop is coming from
the Vatican tomorrow morning...
to perform the wedding."
I'm off the case!
Fujiko?
What? Lupin's gonna hit
the wedding? Really?
If you're after Lupin
That's right!
That's how we'll play it.
We're in a hurry. Move!
Forget it.
Everything past here is all jammed up.
There was a landslide
seven kilometers up the road.
Isn't there some other road?
We're going to be late.
Would you by any chance
be the archbishop?
Ah
Say
If you don't mind a country road
We're saved!
Can you show us the way?
C'mon
Yes.
Anything for the archbishop.
C'mon
We've gotta get there
by nightfall.
Is it really such a good idea
to have TV cameras in here?
His Excellency wishes
to show the world...
that this is a proper
and legal marriage.
The archbishop has arrived.
Do you suppose
Lupin will come?
My Shadows are guarding the bride.
All you need worry about
is guarding the front gate.
The time has come
for light and shadow to be united.
Come
Bring forward the proof...
that these are truly noble members
of the ancient bloodline of Cagliostro.
In accordance to the old custom...
you shall exchange rings
and recite your vows.
Clarisse d'Cagliostro
do you have no objection
to this marriage?
Silence will be taken as agreement.
God's blessing upon you.
<i>I object!</i>
<i>This wedding is soiled</i>
<i>by the Count's desires.</i>
- A curse!
- Don't panic.
The meddlers have simply
made their appearance.
<i>In the name of the dead</i>
<i>who lie beneath this castle...</i>
<i>I have come to take your bride.</i>
- We can't have the wedding now.
- Step back.
This will make fine entertainment.
<i>Clarisse
Ghosts!
This is terrible
Stop the broadcast.
- <i>What are you doing?</i>
- Move out!
<i>Clarisse! Clarisse!</i>
<i>Poor girl.</i>
<i>They've drugged you
<i>The damned Count.</i>
<i>He didn't want you able to speak.</i>
- Mr. Thief!
- No
You were a fool
Clarisse.
Don't cry
<i>I'm coming for you now.</i>
Money?
<i>Do you like my present
Excellency!
<i>They're the counterfeit bills you made.</i>
<i>Take it as payment for the rings.</i>
Damn him! Find him!
He's somewhere in here.
Told you I'd get 'em.
You- Lupin?
Mr. Thief!
How dare you make a fool of me!
Cool off
Lupin! Lupin! Lupin!
Sorry for the delay
We'll resume our broadcast now.
The wedding ceremony is in an uproar!
- Well
After them!
Don't let them escape!
Lupin's escaped.
The Count is following him in a rage.
And here come the police!
Lupin's under the altar.
All together! Charge!
Zenigata's men are opening
a path to the altar.
And here come the royal guards
with Captain Gustav in the lead.
Rear guard
Stand your ground!
Justice is on our side.
This is a really fierce fight
What could be under the altar?
It's a stairway!
There's a hole leading underground.
Could Lupin be in that hole?
Let's take a camera in and find out.
Curse you
- <i>Lupin!</i>
- What's that idiot doing?
He's disobeying orders.
Recall him!
This is a satellite broadcast.
It's too late.
What can this be?
Why
And what do I see over there?
<i>Good grief! Japanese money!</i>
<i>It must be counterfeit.</i>
- Lord
<i>Look. Counterfeit money</i>
<i>from all over the world.</i>
<i>I came in after Lupin and</i>
<i>found this terrible crime.</i>
<i>What should I do?</i>
First of all
Go to it
Leave this to us.
We'll hold 'em off here.
Please be careful.
And you
Please be sure
to come back from this alive.
I'll never forget your kindness.
You'd better go.
Clarisse
Coming!
Sir Jigen
She's lovely.
Let's do some damage.
This sword you face tonight
is like no other.
Curse you
We'll take care of the castle
- Do your wounds hurt?
- Nah
Now
Two goats facing each other.
When you put them together
Light and shadow-
It's too worn. I can't read it.
"When light and
shadow are joined...
face the Goat on high
who faces the sun...
and tells time
and place me in its eyes."
They're old words that have been
passed down through my family.
Are they any help?
Indeed
The Count!
C'mon
They slipped into the clock tower
machinery room. Moor the boat.
There they are.
He's here.
Forget this.
Turn off the lasers. Fools!
Do they think they can leave here?
- Scared?
- No.
Good girl. Let's go!
Don't let 'em go!
Don't look!
We can't go this way.
You men use the stairs.
Stay here.
I'm going to block the entrance.
- Be careful!
- I'll be right back.
There he is!
Mr. Thief! Behind you!
Hiya
You little rat. I'll skewer you.
Time for the finale
One more time!
Hey
Mr. Thief!
I'll finish you off first.
Clarisse
I'll be right there!
And just how far
can you run
Well
Can't you run any further?
The Cagliostro bloodline ends here.
Die
Wait
Too late.
Watch as I kill the girl.
Listen to me!
I'll tell you
the secret of the rings.
The treasure will be yours
to do with as you please.
But let the girl go.
Set her free.
Look. You see the goat crest
on the clock face?
That's the goat which
faces the sun and tells time.
There's a hole
in each eye for the rings.
I'll give you the rings.
However
and then I'll kill you.
That's far enough
All right. I see.
Lupin. I still had one ace
up my sleeve to play.
Come on.
They're real
And now I'll pay you
for solving the mystery.
Let me go!
Clarisse!
Let me go!
The clock tower!
Excellency...
What's happening?
Cagliostro is finished.
Kill me.
I don't take lives without reason.
- Mr. Thief?
- Can you stand? Look.
The hidden treasure.
A Roman city
When the Romans were
driven from here...
they flooded the city
with the floodgate.
Your ancestors secretly inherited it.
This is a treasure for all mankind.
Too big for my pocket anyway.
Interpol finally got off its fat butt.
Are you going to leave now?
Well
Take me with you.
I know I can't be a thief now
I... I...
Please
Clarisse.
Don't be ridiculous.
You want to go back
into the darkness again?
You've finally made it out
into the sunlight
Listen
You shouldn't want to turn into
a terrible person like me.
Oh
I'll come running from
anywhere on Earth to save you.
Karl!
Oh
- Princess Clarisse!
- It's you!
- Mr. Thief!
- Until next time.
Hiya
Mr. Thief!
Stay well
Thank you!
Good bye
Adieu! Adieu!
Blast it!
I was one step behind him.
Lupin managed to steal
something again.
No
No
Your heart.
Yes.
Well
Follow Lupin! Follow him
to the ends of the Earth!
They all seem like such nice people.
I feel as though
I know that man from long ago.
Lupin
She's a nice kid.
You could stay if you want.
Oh? Fujiko!
Lupin!
Take a look at what I scored.
Hey!
The counterfeit printing plates!
- Can we be friends?
- See you!
Hey
It's the Old Man again.
Lupin!
You won't escape this time.
