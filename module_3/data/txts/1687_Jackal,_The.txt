<i>Mr. Gorbachev,

It's her.
- Ghazzi's in the club.
- He's in position.
Okay. Op's a go.
MVD only.
What is this? An American?
Who the fuck are you?
Deputy Director
Carter Preston, FBI.
FBI.
You fuck Americans now,
you ugly militia whore.
And, you,
go fuck yourself.
This is not Chicago.
This is Russia.
So take your bitch and
get the fuck out of here.
Do you think I'm afraid
of the MVD?
I swear I will kill you and your
fucking whore mothers.
I repeat,
you are advised...
Fuck you! Fuck you,
you scar-faced cunt!
Fuck you!
All right, that's enough.
It's never easy
taking a life.
But you saved one,
too. Mine.
Thank you.
We had no warning.
They must have ambushed
our man outside.
Before we knew it,
there were militia
with their guns out in
every corner of the room.
They just opened fire
and killed him.
It happened so fast, it was
over before it started.
God, my poor brother.
How many militia
did you kill?
Terek, please,
we didn't stand a chance.
There were 30 of them,
plus the Americans.
Yes, yes, but how many
did you kill?
Well...
Well, none.
None? Not even one?
Terek, please.
I did what I could.
You did what you could.
You did what you could.
You let those militia pigs and that
American scum kill my brother
without killing
one in return.
Okay,
that's what you could do.
Here's what I can do.
I loved this man
like a brother.
He was a dear friend
and partner to me.
So I took no joy in that.
But just think,
if I could do this
to one I love,
what could I do
to someone I hate?
Hmm?
So, the American FBI
declares war on us?
Then war it is.
Unlike other less
cunning predators,
the hyena takes no chances,
never attacking unless sure of a kill.
Though a consummate killer,
he is clearly no gentleman.
I apologize
for keeping you waiting.
I had some other business
to dispose of.
So much wasted time
confusing motion with accomplishment.
Another drink?
The MVD killed my brother.
For that, I will see
they drown in blood.
But to their allies in America,
I wish to send a message.
A very public message.
I want to strike fear into
the marrow of their bones.
Can you kill this person?
Yes.
If I take this job,
I'll have to disappear
forever.
So if you want me
to do this, you're going
to have to pay me.
How much?
American dollars.
All cash, of course.
Half now,
half upon completion.
$70 million.
Why not?
Done.
How many people
know about this?
You and I.
Keep it that way.
Don't refer
to our arrangement by
telephone or fax, ever.
You should find a place
outside of Russia to hide
until the mission's completed.
If word of this leaks,
it'll be my choice
whether to continue
the mission or not.
Either way,
I keep the initial payment.
Agreed?
Okay.
Informants tell us
Terek's put bounties on
all MVD and FBI personnel.
Deputy Director Preston
and I have special bounties
on our lives.
In two weeks,
seven MVD operatives
have been killed.
At least we know
we're getting to him.
Informants say
this is just the start.
Terek's planning
something more dramatic.
Eight days ago,
Terek and his two top
lieutenants were spotted
at a pension
in the town of Porvoo,
60 kilometers
west of Helsinki.
They've been there ever since,
taking the entire third floor
for themselves
and their bodyguards,
all former Spetsnaz,
nine in all.
Not one's left the building
in five days.
Their only contact with
the outside is this man,
Victor Politovsky.
He goes to
the Porvoo post office twice
a day for Terek's mail
which arrives
general delivery.
Contact Interpol
and get everything
you can on Politovsky.
Yes, sir.
Terek's men are
notoriously hard to turn out.
Should we get the opportunity
we must be prepared
to conduct the interrogation
with the utmost efficiency.
Good day to you,
Mr. Preston.
Sir.
I don't think
I want to know
what that means.
The new lamination's
the tricky part.
You got to use
ethyl acetone.
Nasty stuff.
Gives you liver cancer.
And I use a disc drive
to erase the magnetic strip.
It's perfect.
Thank you.
You really do
beautiful work.
Oh, well. Art comes
in various guises,
doesn't it?
Yes, it does.
What do I owe you?
Right.
Well, I think your balance
is about L375.
This is L500.
Oh, thank you.
Good luck with the baby.
Thank you.
Cheers.
See you next time.
How do you want
the accounts handled?
Split the deposit equally
between the Macao
and the Panama accounts.
And the balance?
Leave it here in dollars.
I'll need you to open me
a Luxembourg account.
And get me
some credit cards.
Use an American bank.
I'll send you the names
this week.
I'll overnight
the credit cards to
your box in Montreal.
Oh. This also came
in the draft.
Ah. Yes.
I'll need to use
your computer, Clive.
Of course.
Everything's ready for you.
Good. Thank you.
- Good afternoon.
- How may we help you?
I'm interested in
an intermediate range system,
high cyclic rate.
Man portable?
Compact,
vehicle-mounted unit.
What caliber?
No smaller than 7.62.
Available:
7.62 millimeter
M134 electric Gatling gun.
I prefer non-US equipment,
single-parallel system.
Available:
Yugoslav 20 millimeter
19/55 cannon.
Too heavy.
Available:
Polish ZSU-33 electric,
14.5 millimeter.
1,400 rounds per minute.
Interested.
3,500 meters.
1,700 meters per second.
I'll take it.
Cost will be $200,000 US.
Transfer of funds
in the usual manner.
Half now, half on delivery
to the following address.
Letterham Shipping,
Montreal, Quebec, Canada,
GIH 876.
Client name,
Murdock, Charles C.
"What are they planning?
Why is Terek in Finland?"
"The Americans.
Kill. Example."
"Jackal? What Jackal?
It doesn't make sense."
"What are they planning
at work?"
"Who are you?"
"You fucking Jackal."
"Why you hanging around?
Revive him."
Jesus.
Drug-assisted interrogation
is perfectly legal
in matters of state security.
Unfortunately,
Mr. Politovsky had an
undiagnosed heart condition.
He said, "Jackal"?
Does this mean
something to you,
Mr. Preston?
There's supposedly
a killer for hire
who uses that name.
Several assassinations
are credited to him,
but we've never been
able to prove
if he even exists.
From time to time,
he was KGB asset.
Do you have a name?
No name.
Payments were made
to the contracting
organization
or a Hong Kong
bank account.
No KGB member
has ever seen him.
Do we know if he ever
operated in the US?
No. But
Politovsky's briefcase
contained biographical
material
on your Donald Brown,
Director of the FBI.
Jesus Christ.
This guy's going
for the gold, huh?
Get him on
the phone for me.
Yes, sir.
Good morning.
Purpose of your
visit to Canada?
Steelhead.
Hmm?
Fishing.
Enjoy your stay,
Mr. Hayslip.
Thank you. I will.
I'll give you
a good deal on this minivan,
you know.
It's brand-new.
It's fully loaded.
We've even got
a six-disc CD changer
for you.
Now, the only thing I need
right now is your driver's
license, your credit card
and I'll check this
with the credit manager.
I think everything should
be okay, Mr. Murdock.
Make it Charlie, aye?
All right then, Charlie.
See you in a second.
Take your time.
I want this op close-hold,
no publicity.
Put a working group together.
State, CIA, Secret Service,
Russian Embassy.
They'll have daily
progress reports, 9:00 p.m.
every evening, this office.
Major Koslova,
anything else?
Since 1 983,
KGB provided funding for
five direct-action missions.
One bombing
and four assassinations
by gunshot.
The Jackal was
the operative used.
Not giving me much
to work with, Preston.
We don't have much, sir.
Major Koslova's informers
can't finger him.
They don't know who he is,
CIA can't track him.
Then what?
Using KGB files,
I've identified
six operatives
we believe to have
actually seen him.
Four are dead,
one in Libya,
but the last is
believed to be here
in the United States.
A Basque separatist
name Isabella Celia Zancona.
She might at least know
what he looks like.
But we have no idea
of her whereabouts.
Well,
someone must have.
Interpol says that
in the '80s
she was involved with
one Declan Joseph Mulqueen,
an IRA sharpshooter.
The word is
he burned out, sir.
They decided to get him out
of Ireland entirely,
shipped him over here.
In '89, he picked up
twice 25 years for some old
weapons trafficking charges.
He's serving time
at a maximum-security
state pen in Massachusetts.
All right.
Say he does know
where she is.
What makes you think
he'll talk to you?
I'm hoping he'll cooperate
for a reduced sentence.
- But don't promise too much.
- After all, he's a terrorist.
You got some visitors,
Mulqueen.
What do you want
with Isabella?
She's done nothing here.
She entered
the country illegally.
What? The FBI's sending
deputy directors out
after illegal aliens?
Give over, Preston.
Who you really looking for?
A pro.
Calls himself "The Jackal."
That fellow.
The mystery man.
We think she might have
seen him and may be
able to help us find him.
If so, we'll arrange
a pardon for her
signed by
the President of
the United States.
And guarantee no extradition.
We'd also guarantee
the Spanish government
will never know
her whereabouts.
They don't know now,
do they?
And neither do you.
Let's keep it that way.
Would it matter
that you might be
saving a human life?
And whose human life would
I be saving that would be
important enough for all this?
Mr. Donald Brown,
Director of the FBI.
Wouldn't that be droll?
Look. We know that
certain gang elements in
this prison want you dead.
An entire government
wants me dead, mister.
Yet here I am.
All right, smart ass,
let's cut the bullshit.
You cooperate and
we'll get you transferred to
a minimum-security facility.
That's our deal.
And that's your only chance
to ever walk out
of this goddamn place
in one piece.
That's a one-time offer.
Now take it or leave it.
Stuff it then,
as many fucking times
as you like.
Pardon the language.
I've been in prison.
All right,
what will it take
for you to help us?
First, I'd have to be
convinced Isabella
would be kept safe.
Done.
Then you'd have
to let me go.
Back to Ireland,
a free man.
Out of the question.
Besides gunrunning,
you're a known killer of
British government personnel.
Not to mention all the women
and children you've probably
blown up.
It's not my war.
I was never a bomber.
I don't see the distinction.
You still took human lives.
The distinction is I killed
in a war. Now I want
to go home. Simple as that.
Simple for you, perhaps.
Look, even in Russia,
soldiers go home when
the treaty's signed, nyet?
Well, that's not
gonna happen. Sorry.
All right,
just the chance then.
Your best efforts
to get me free.
I'll settle for
your word on it.
Sorry.
So the Jackal's after
your director, is he?
Best tell him to get
his affairs in order
because nobody
can save him now.
Nobody except me.
Because I met him.
Oh, yeah,
didn't I mention it?
I can identify him
by his face,
given the opportunity,
but more importantly,
by his methods.
So you can leave
Isabella out of this.
Did you work with him?
With him?
No. No way.
Do you have a problem
with this man?
That's between
him and me.
Isabella Zancona
is the only confirmed
contact we have
and we will find her.
With or without your help.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
I want three things.
One, get me out of here.
I'm no use to you
sitting here on my ass.
What's to keep you from
trying to taking off?
Nothing.
Except I give you my word.
Two, I go with you
to meet Isabella.
Why?
I want to see her, is all.
And the third thing?
A decent razor.
Here's how
it's gonna go, Mulqueen.
You will be searched
on a random schedule.
And if we turn up as much
as a paper clip that
hasn't been authorized,
I'll send you
right back to prison.
Same goes for using
the telephone.
What?
You don't trust me?
As far as I can throw you.
But I have little choice.
If you've got any thoughts
about an IRA snatch,
we'll shoot to kill,
them and you.
And not necessarily
in that order.
Understand?
I heard you.
Go along
and we'll get along.
I'm gonna keep
a real good eye on you.
Miss Koslova, is it?
Mmm-hmm.
What would
your first name be then?
Major.
Major Koslova.
A wee bit rusty,
that's all.
Subassembly
of titanium, as light as
the stresses will allow.
The arm's got to
traverse 270 degrees.
Feed and drive mechanisms
run on 21 0 amp servos.
The whole thing has got
to run off 1 2-volt DC.
Okay. Yeah,
it's a car battery.
That's cool.
How much weight is
the arm gonna have
to support?
Fifty-five kilograms.
It's a big fucker, yeah?
Hey, you want one?
No.
I'm gonna want this
in eight days.
I can do that.
Okay.
How much?
Well, the titanium's
gonna be a problem.
It's a listed material
up here. It's gonna take
some time,
a little more money.
$50,000?
I mean, like, well, 40.
Forty grand.
All right. Half now,
half on delivery.
This sucker's definitely
gonna kick some ass, yeah?
Get this straight.
When you finish this unit,
you're gonna turn over the
plans and any scrap material.
You're gonna forget about
Charlie Murdock and the tech
specs on these plans.
Yeah. Shit, man, I'm cool.
Relax.
All right.
Are you nervous?
Eight years.
That's a lifetime,
isn't it?
Hello.
Mr. Decker, is it?
Yes.
Yeah. Hello there.
I'm Declan Mulqueen.
This is Major Koslova.
How do you do?
Hi.
We'd like to speak
to your wife.
Izz,
someone to see you.
I'll take the kids
out back.
Daddy, who's that?
My beautiful Irish...
They let me out
to ask you something.
Sir, I was thinking maybe
we could use the Zancona
woman as insurance
in case Mulqueen
gets happy feet.
Listen,
however he plays it,
we play it straight.
Isabella Zancona's
involvement
remains classified.
That means nothing
in the report.
No name, no location,
nothing. Got it?
Yes, sir.
I never knew
his name, but he was
definitely American.
He had some kind of
special military training
where he learned Spanish,
in El Salvador, I think.
I didn't like
talking to him.
I suppose we were
all dangerous people
but he was different.
I mean, Declan was fire,
all passion.
He had a cause.
This man was ice.
No feeling, nothing.
Okay. Thank you, Mrs. Decker.
You've been very helpful.
Incidentally,
it would be best if you keep
our conversation confidential,
even from your husband.
Don't worry about George.
He doesn't know
anything about my past
and he doesn't want to.
All he needs to know
is that I love him.
I see. Well,
I thank you again.
I'll wait for you
in the car.
This opens a locker
at Norfolk Greyhound
Terminal.
Inside is a clean passport
and $1 0,000 cash.
Your friends left it with me
in case you ever showed up.
Take it and go
back to Ireland.
I can't.
What?
You gave your word? Huh?
Go now.
Once he kills whoever
he's after, they'll send
you back to prison.
When I believe that,
I'll use the key.
Are you happy at least?
Yes. I love my children.
And my husband,
in my way, I mean.
Some nights I can
close my eyes and sleep
and no dead faces
come to wake me.
That's more than
I ever had.
You wouldn't have me
give that up, would you?
Give me some credit,
will you?
She's Basque,
isn't she?
Aye.
They say Basques
live by the vendetta.
If they hate someone,
it's to the death.
It's the same way
when they love.
My first name is Valentina.
You have family in Russia?
My parents.
My brother,
in the navy.
Husband? Kids?
No. I have not
found the time.
In truth, it's never
been a conflict for me.
This is not a quality
a man looks for in a woman.
By the way,
whatever Isabella
gave you after I left,
I trust you won't use it
until after our business
is concluded.
Don't miss a thing,
do you?
No, Mr. Mulqueen.
I see everything.
Maybe we should
start by canceling
your public appearances.
No, I don't think
that's necessary.
I mean, not yet.
This fellow's gonna need
to make preparations.
He'll need time.
How tight are the borders?
Mexico and Canada have...
Mr. Mulqueen?
Something you'd like
to share with us?
He'll likely be using
four false identities.
Three will be on him,
and one in reserve
at a drop box somewhere.
At least that's the way
he used to operate.
What matter if he has 40?
It's still one man.
Might we not be creating
a storm in a tea cup?
Exactly. I agree
with you 1 00 percent.
Director Bolitonov.
Terek has always made
doing his own killing
a point of honor.
Usually very bloody
and very public.
A statement,
if you will.
So, if he's hired
an outsider,
obviously, this is something
he takes very seriously.
Until this Jackal
is captured or killed,
I don't think we can
afford to do any less.
Come on.
Let's get real here, okay?
I mean, it's one guy.
It's just one guy.
Bolitonov's right.
With the assets in this room,
the guy is as good as got.
That's if he doesn't go ahead
and stick his dick
in a wringer first,
like a lot of these clowns.
Remember that guy?
What was his name?
What's that,
Mr. Mulqueen?
I'm sorry, Mr. Brown,
but this man is no clown.
He knows all your moves,
back to front.
Right now, you got a name.
That's all you got.
The Jackal's got a target.
You. He's got a timetable.
And as to making mistakes,
he's spent 20 years in a trade
that doesn't forgive error.
And he's prevailed.
You think he's the one
who is up against us?
It's the other way around.
Hi.
Hi.
Can I buy you a drink?
Yeah.
I think you should
come home with me.
I'd love to
but I can't.
I have to go
back to Atlanta
to finalize
my very messy divorce.
Does she know?
She does now.
So how am I gonna
see you again?
You could give me
one of your cards.
You're not gonna call.
Douglas.
You just have to have
a little faith in people,
that's all.
Like I do.
Open your shirt.
Easy now. Easy.
Now!
Easy.
Open your shirt.
Easy now.
Souvenirs of
British hospitality.
I apologize.
No problem.
Oslo Travel came up
with a James William Hayslip
who flew from Toronto,
August 25, two days before
the meeting with Terek.
We checked the Social Security
number on his passport,
and guess what?
It belongs to an inmate
committed to
a mental institution
in Virginia 1 2 years ago.
Now, Canadian Travel
says he flew
to Montreal nine days ago.
Hello?
Hello?
Yeah?
Yeah, Charlie Murdock.
Picking up a delivery, eh?
Invoice.
Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes.
It's a hot one, eh?
You can say that again.
Hi. I need to use
one of your computers.
Sure. Any one.
Can I get online with this?
Yeah, sure.
Go check upstairs.
Thank you.
Hayslip's disappeared.
Border Patrol has
the passport photo,
but nothing's shown up yet.
He's moved on.
I told you.
One moment.
The only place we're sure
he's been is Montreal.
What if he started using
the next identity there?
I'm not following you.
Hayslip disappeared,
that doesn't mean
the Jackal did.
Perhaps something
has happened.
Witherspoon, have the Montreal
police go through their logs
for the last 48 hours.
If he's on to the next name,
it's because it's in the plan.
A man like this
doesn't make mistakes.
No?
They always make one,
somewhere.
Isn't that how
you were caught?
Ouch.
What's her story, then?
Major Koslova
ends the debate about
women in combat,
as far as I'm concerned.
How's that?
When she saved my life
and took out Terek's brother,
she did it knowing she'd
be drawing a death sentence
down on her own neck.
But when we offered
to set her up someplace
else when this is over,
you know what she said?
"The good guys don't hide."
Fierce woman.
In that country,
under that system...
Staggering.
Oh, shit, you know what?
I couldn't get titanium.
So, I had a friend
mould the base out
of carbon fiber instead.
Came in 23 kilos
under the weight
you asked for.
Is that cool?
Yeah, that's great.
I'm still gonna want
the plans, the mould and the
scrap material. Remember?
Yeah. Um... Hmm.
Maybe we ought to
talk about that.
Oh?
See, uh...
Well, I mean, this rig,
I figure it's to support
something pretty heavy,
right?
Like a Gatling gun,
maybe?
Or a 20-millimeter cannon?
So you gotta be shooting
at something pretty big,
right?
Armored car, maybe?
Bank vault?
I don't know. You know, you
could be shooting a fucking
airliner for all I know.
But the point is,
a job like this
can attract
a lot of attention.
I don't want
any attention.
Right, right.
And that's why I'm saying.
I think the plans
and mould are worth
a little bonus.
How much?
I don't know.
$1 00,000?
Come on, man.
You know it's worth it.
You got a serious piece
of equipment there.
All right.
I'll get you
$50,000 tomorrow.
I'm gonna need a place to
test this, though. Someplace
that won't draw any attention.
We got a place like that.
We got a place just like that.
Target's in place.
Man, I think I should have
brought some beer.
Motherfuckin' motherfucker.
That motherfucker
is state of the art!
Dude, I knew
it was gonna be big.
I didn't know it was
gonna be the fuckin'
prototype cannon.
It's a fucking mole.
Damn.
Some hairy-looking rounds.
Made from depleted uranium.
It'll go through anything.
Once they get inside,
they just spall.
Hell, yeah.
They spall? Yeah.
They get in there,
and they just...
That rocks.
Look at the friggin' lens
on that thing.
Don't touch that.
It's got, like,
a 2,000-mile zoom lens.
That thing is kick-ass.
Dude, is this thing
a prototype, or what?
I bet you it cost you
a shitload. That rocks.
Man, you rock.
Do you know
what I'm saying?
Rock!
Fucking thing
kicks ass.
Oh, yeah.
Bring on the spall, baby.
I can't wait
to see the fuck...
Lamont.
Close your mouth.
Smooth action, yeah?
Ready?
Yeah! Spall!
Well, at least
it took out the target.
No, it's off.
By at least
three millimeters.
No. No, dude.
That's precision
craftsmanship.
It ain't off
no three millimeters.
So, Lamont,
tell me how you sight in
this thing automatically.
Uh, you just, uh, punch in
the windage and the elevation
you want and hit enter.
So you just kind of
guestimate it, huh?
Basically guestimation.
And hit enter.
Uh-huh.
Hey, hey, hey!
I give up!
Well,
I guess the automatic
sighting works.
Yeah.
I thought I was
about to sprawl.
Well, Lamont,
I'm gonna have to
speed test it now.
Mmm. Speed test.
So, run.
What do you mean?
I mean run, now.
Run to your right!
Get up. Get up!
All right, good!
Oh, oh! Stop there!
Just stop there!
Turn around!
Hold out that
pack of cigarettes!
Don't be afraid!
Stand very still!
Stand still!
I told you it was off.
Move over by the car!
Quick, before you pass out!
Here we go, sir.
Major. Mac.
Eleven days ago,
Charles C. Murdock
bought himself
a brand-new Dodge minivan.
Now, that was a big surprise
to Mr. Murdock
whose passport and wallet
were stolen 16 days ago
at the Helsinki airport.
Anything
from the border?
We sent a description
of the van to every crossing
from here to Manitoba.
I have something.
Uphall Station. It's a small
town outside Ottawa.
I think your man
has been there.
Let's go.
The owner is Ian Lamont,
small-time hood.
The coroner has
what's left of him
at Broxburn.
Yeah,
we get the idea.
Let's get to the shop.
Hello. Think I got
something here.
What is it?
This is a remote
firing station.
See, it maneuvers
a weapon.
The servos run off
a remote control,
like a model airplane.
We used to make these things
for mortars or such,
but nothing
like this size.
He needs a van
just to move it around.
What would something
this size be used for?
Antiaircraft?
No, no, you can buy
a mount for that.
No, a missile's
the best thing for
an aircraft.
No, this is for
something else entirely.
Something with
one hell of a range.
Not just the range, though.
See, if it is a gun,
it's the cyclic rate.
You can send off 100 bullets
before the first one
ever hits the target.
Good thing
about a boat like this
is it sells itself.
It's a hell of a lot of boat
for the money. It's got radar,
GPS, autopilot, auto-furling.
You can take this baby out
by yourself.
This has even got
a cellular phone.
You can call your wife
if you want to.
So, what do you think?
"Deja Vu. "
She's perfect.
Yes?
Jackal.
They know about Hayslip.
They know you were in Canada,
and they have an Irishman
helping them.
Irishman's name?
Mulqueen.
Declan Mulqueen?
Declan Mulqueen.
The operation's still a go.
Declan.
Every crossing point and
airport has his photograph,
but RCMP has nothing.
On our side,
the Border Patrol, the INS
are both on the highest alert.
Again, nothing.
I mean, let's face it,
you don't have to be Houdini
to make it across
from Canada.
He probably
walked across,
for Christ's sake.
He won't be walking,
I can tell you that.
He's got a weapon to move.
What kind of security patrols
do you have on these?
The Great Lakes?
Not a lot. No need.
People either drive or fly.
There are a few
ferry services,
but we checked
those out as well.
What about people
with boats?
What kind of
immigration controls
do you have?
Arriving vessels
have to check
with the harbormaster.
Mmm. Voluntarily?
Yeah.
No active enforcement.
All right.
Say he does use a boat,
he'll still want to
mix with others.
Are there many gatherings
to speak of?
Yeah, the Mackinaw Regatta
is going on now.
It's the biggest regatta
on Lake Michigan.
From where to where?
It starts in Mackinaw
and it ends in Chicago.
Witherspoon,
take Waveland.
Declan, Valentina,
Chicago Yacht Club.
I'll take the locals.
And remember,
it'll be an Ontario
registered boat
if it's here,
so look at everything
and stay on your radios.
If you do find something,
call in backup.
I want an arrest,
not a fire fight.
All right,
let's get to it.
Preston, what about
letting me have a gun?
Are you crazy?
If the right people knew
I was letting you walk
around without cuffs,
I'd get forced retirement.
No fucking gun.
So many people.
So many rich people.
Shall we dance?
He wouldn't give me a gun.
He is hot.
He's mine.
Back off.
Hey, you want
some champagne?
Come on. Join us.
Maybe later.
Join us.
Declan!
Get out of the way!
Preston,
can I talk to you?
Look, he saw me.
He wasn't surprised.
Like he was expecting me.
One of your team
is playing
for the other side.
Impossible. I can vouch
for every man on this team.
I'm telling you,
you've got a traitor.
This is not the IRA.
We don't get
infiltrators.
Somebody got to him.
Look, this is a manhunt,
not your cause.
Don't make it personal.
What do you fucking know?
I'll tell you
what I know.
I know the Jackal
set you up in that
arms deal in Libya.
I know Isabella
was wounded when you
walked into the trap.
I also know that it was
the business you had chosen.
Did you also know that
Isabella was pregnant
when she got shot?
That our child
didn't survive?
Don't tell me it's not
personal, Mr. Preston.
I can't let you
jeopardize us
in a vendetta.
There's no vendetta.
All I hope for
is a fresh start,
you know?
Maybe it'll happen.
This was recorded
at 1:00 a.m. this morning.
It's a call to a number
in Brighton Beach, New York.
Item four.
At 1:05 p.m., Director Brown
is scheduled to meet
the First Lady
at a diplomatic reception
at the White House
regarding the New Hope
Hospital opening.
Other participants
will be decided...
That information
came out of this room.
Who? Whose voice is it
on that tape?
Mine.
Mr. Ambassador,
we have arranged
to hold a 9:00 p.m.
Aeroflot flight to Moscow.
A car is waiting to drive
Colonel Bolitonov
to the airport.
How did you know
whose phone to tap?
I didn't,
so I tapped everybody's.
But I have
diplomatic immunity.
Who authorized you
to tap my telephone?
I did, Ambassador.
We're currently
examining documents
taken from Director
Bolitonov's apartment.
Get me a helicopter.
Jackal.
Director Bolitonov
is no longer contactable
at this number.
All inquiries should be
forwarded to...
This is only a precaution
for a short while,
until we get this man.
You and your family will be
safer in Washington.
You don't
really think you'll find him,
because you won't.
Believe me, you can't.
It's our job to try.
And waste your time
and maybe get killed
for nothing?
I began this.
I have to do what I can,
so please
get your family away.
Let's go.
Okay.
Everything okay?
Valentina's evacuating
Isabella and her family
in case the Jackal knows
where she lives.
Look, the director
doesn't even know
where Isabella lives.
I ordered Witherspoon
to keep her
out of the report.
No way Jackal knows.
Well, our Russian black-heart
surely passed everything else
to him, didn't he?
Here, look.
That's your phone number.
That's Valentina's.
You know those two
at the bottom?
The first one's
the Russian Embassy.
The second one's...
Son of a bitch.
What?
This is an FBI access code.
FBI Data Center.
This is Special Agent
Carter Preston.
My authorization number
is 223578-Kilo.
Shit!
I need a voice
transcription
of field report
November Alpha
from 9-1 5 this year.
Agent filing,
Witherspoon, Timothy I.
And I'm in a hurry, operator.
I shouldn't have trusted you.
Field report November Alpha
filed 0900 hours...
Scroll.
To perform interview
of subject Isabella Zancona
at the following address...
Shit.
Witherspoon,
you by-the-book asshole!
Shit!
I'm gonna check upstairs.
Witherspoon?
Come out!
Please don't shoot me.
Just taking out
the garbage.
I got one more trip.
Hurry.
We'll meet you
at the front.
Yes, ma'am.
All locked up.
Where's Witherspoon?
He's in the backyard,
taking out the trash.
It's coming from the back.
Let's go!
Where is it coming from?
I don't know.
Set to go off
two minutes ago.
What the hell?
Where's McMurphy?
Press here, hard.
It'll slow the bleeding.
See, that's bad.
Blood's almost black.
That means the bullet's
in your liver.
You got about
20 minutes to live.
If the pain gets too much,
you can take your hand away
and you'll be dead
in five minutes.
When Declan kills you,
you think of me, okay?
Okay.
I'll make a note of that.
If you see Declan
before you die,
you tell him that
he can't protect his women.
They're all right.
Let them through.
Valentina?
You'll be fine.
Huh?
Yeah.
Hi.
Yeah.
Declan...
It's all right, darling.
You're gonna be fine.
I tried
to protect Isabella.
Oh, I know, I know.
You did fine.
He said to tell you,
say, "You can't
protect your women."
Valentina.
Oh. No, Valentina.
No, don't. Valentina!
Don't go. Stay.
Stay with me.
Oh, Declan.
Oh, Declan,
it was him, wasn't it?
I thought this was
all behind us.
Is this ever gonna end?
Yes. I promise you,
it will end,
and I will end it.
Do you have a gun?
Following a low-light
helicopter insertion
a team could infiltrate
the weapon to a point here,
covering the northern
approaches and Route One.
If your weapon has nearly
the range and cyclic rate
you're advertising,
it could engage any
ground vehicle and aircraft
approaching the base.
He doesn't have a helicopter
or a team to help him set up.
He's alone.
What do you say, Mulqueen?
Well, the only way
he can make the kill and
escape is from a distance.
So we make sure you're
always secure indoors
with a perimeter of men
outside your location.
And pick our battles?
Exactly.
Tying a noose,
if you like.
When he makes his move,
we tighten the noose
and we hang him.
Not exactly foolproof,
I know, but it's
the best we got.
The best we've got?
You have a call on line six.
Thank you.
This is Doug.
Told you I'd call.
Oh, hi.
How are you?
You've just got
to have a little faith
in people, Douglas.
Okay. Well, okay.
Now that I've got faith,
are you busy tonight?
Are you here?
You're in town, yes?
...feels like temperatures
are gonna be...
Hello?
...next couple of days.
No rain expected
right now.
I'm home.
We are looking at the system
that's moving into our area
later on tonight...
I see you found the keys.
Where are you?
In the garage!
Wow. You dyed your hair.
Yeah.
Like it?
Yeah, sure.
You like Korean food?
Uh, sure. Yeah.
Dig in.
I thought we were gonna...
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought we were
gonna go out.
Yeah. Maybe later.
- Thank you, Michael.
- Great weather report.
Recapping tonight's top story,
police are asking
for your help
in locating this man.
He's wanted in several states
in connection with a series
of brutal murders,
but police believe he's in
the Washington area tonight.
The man is thought to be armed
and extremely dangerous.
If you see him, police warn
not to approach him,
but to notify
authorities immediately.
Temperatures around
the area, like we said,
here at National Airport
in the District, 89 degrees.
If you're looking for some
of the cooler temperatures,
head on out
to the mountains...
You know,
when I first moved here,
I realized I was living
in someone else's house
and that's a huge burden.
You're invited to live
in the White House
for four years...
So you feel
like a renter in a sense?
Most definitely.
With a lease
that's renewable or...
John F. Kennedy said once
that if somebody wanted
to kill a public official,
they can get away with it
as long as they're willing
to pay the price.
It's impossible to provide
100 percent safety.
Would you agree?
Certainly.
I mean, there is
no way around that,
but hopefully there aren't
that many people
who are willing to do that.
Preston!
Declan, what?
Do you remember
Valentina said,
"A statement,
public and brutal."
Now, it always bothered me.
Why did he keep coming
when he knew we could
protect the director,
especially once
I got involved.
But he didn't abort. Why?
It didn't come together
until I remembered
what he said to Valentina.
"Tell Declan he can't
protect his women."
Wasn't he referring
to Isabella?
No. Any woman. All women.
But remember,
"Public and brutal."
We're guarding
the wrong person.
He's after the First Lady.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
I'm sure you're as happy
as I am to be here today.
It's been a lot of hard work
for a lot of us
but here we are,
and we're about to celebrate.
And now it gives me
great pleasure to introduce
the Surgeon General
of the United States.
Madam Chairperson,
ladies and gentlemen.
I'd like to chat
with you today
about the family.
She's already on the dais.
Secret Service wants to know
what's going on.
Tell them.
No! No, they'll try
to get her off the dais.
If they do that,
he'll shoot off
into the crowd.
We've worked long and hard
to reach our goal,
and I must say that we
certainly have accomplished
what we set out to do
since we first began
with a seed of an idea.
It took many
long and hard hours to...
Get the word?
Looking for a dark brown
minivan and anything else
that's out of its place.
The only minivan we found
is this red one here.
I checked it out
about 1 5 minutes ago.
They got a local
parking permit, DC tags.
We can check it out again,
if you want.
Nah. It's probably
one of those safer-than-sorry,
circle-jerk type deals.
Yeah.
I'll see you.
You guys be safe.
Secret Service says
the search came out negative.
They're on alert,
but she's going to the podium.
Guess it's on us.
You'll need a gun.
Forget the laser.
You'll have to walk me
through the optics
on this thing.
I haven't shot a gun
in a while.
I can see by the warm and
friendly faces out there
that this christening
has been long anticipated.
Thanks to all of you
who made this dream possible.
We've worked long and hard
to reach our goal
and I must say that
we certainly have accomplished
what we set out to do.
It's proof that when we
set out to reach new heights,
it can be done.
Go! Clear!
I'm going
for the First Lady.
You're cleared to shoot
on the weapon or the shooter.
Ladies and gentlemen,
it gives me great pleasure
to introduce the First Lady
of the United States.
It's a beautiful day
for the beginning of New Hope.
All right.
Go, go, go!
Give me the gun.
So that's how
he plans to get out.
The phone,
give me your phone.
But also right now
there are police officers
risking their very lives
to help kids stay out
of trouble and off drugs.
He's clear.
But also right now,
there are dedicated teachers
preparing lessons
for a new day's class.
Red minivan,
hillside by the trees.
One o'clock.
Jesus.
Range it.
750, 762 meters.
...but values his family.
Right. I'm after him.
You take out the minivan.
Move it! Go, go, go!
Coming through!
Hey!
Look out!
Coming through!
- Excuse me.
- Watch it, man!
Now arriving, the inbound
train from Turnbull Station.
Please stand clear
of the doors.
No!
Shite!
The next train
departing Capitol Heights...
Come on!
Yeah, Capitol Heights.
Shit.
Hey!
Shut up!
Get out!
Get out of here! Now!
Run!
Oh, my God!
Don't stop! Keep going!
Give me your hand!
Help me, please!
Help me!
Say, "Help me, Declan."
Help me, Declan.
Help me, Declan.
Help me, Declan!
Please help!
Please, Declan, help me!
Please help me!
Help!
Declan!
Louder!
Help me, Declan!
Help me, Declan!
Now tell me where
the man with the gun is.
Around the corner.
Good girl,
good girl, good girl.
What are you gonna do,
Declan?
You just can't
seem to protect
any of your women.
Let her go.
She has nothing
to do with this.
Now, you can
save this girl.
What's your name?
Maggie.
Maggie. You can
save Maggie, you see?
You can save her
right now.
You just have
to put down
your little gun.
Okay?
Declan!
No!
Go ahead.
Take the shot.
Oh, Maggie,
you did so good.
You did so good.
You're slipping, Declan.
Now let her go.
Step away from the gun.
Step away from the gun!
Ah, Maggie, Maggie.
You're so brave.
You'll remember this
for the rest of your life.
Kneel down.
Kneel down.
Sorry, Declan.
It's all right.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's finished.
I wonder
if we'll ever know
who the hell
he really was.
We know all
we need to.
He was evil.
He's dead and he's gone.
Nothing more matters.
Sorry they didn't
give you your pardon.
You'll get minimum security.
It's like a country club.
By the way,
Director Brown sends
his warmest thanks.
Oh, that's nice.
Look forward to
playing tennis with him.
Did I tell you
I'm going back
to Russia?
And I'm going to stay
until Terek Murad rots
in prison or in the grave.
She'd appreciate that.
I think so.
And Isabella?
Back safe
with her family.
For good.
I know about
that key she gave you.
I know you could
have used it to take off
any time you wanted to.
You've got one of those
drop boxes, too,
like the Jackal?
Did you read the paper today?
I'm quite the hero
because of you.
The agent who saved
the First Lady.
I could screw everything
else up for the rest
of my life and still be
untouchable.
That a fact, then?
Going back
to the drop box,
an operative with
your experience
with a clean passport
a wad of cash.
I'll bet
if you had taken off
we never would
have found you.
Do you drink coffee?
Oh, no, that's right.
They drink Guinness
in Ireland.
I'll ask across the street.
See if they've got any.
Coffee, I mean.
I'll be back in
30 minutes, okay?
Thanks, Declan,
for everything.
No, thank you, Da.
