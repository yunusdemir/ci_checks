<i>Previously on</i> Wisdom of the Crowd...
Tell him I might know
who killed Mia Tanner.
You should've just kept your
mouth shut about that girl.
Carlos was bleeding internally.
They had to move him to county.
The last time
we saw each other,
I was accusing your son of
the worst possible crime.
I'm not sure what to think anymore.
If he didn't kill Mia and
he dies because of this...
All we can hope is that we get
a chance to make this right.
What-what happened?
Did Ochoa... Is-is he...
No, no.
For once, it's good news.
Come on.
<i>He'd lost a lot of blood</i>
by the time he got here.
The prison hospital
didn't do him any favors.
They missed the secondary
internal injury.
You can speak to him briefly.
Then he needs to rest. Understand?
Yes.
Of course, Doctor.
Thank you.
Carlos. Carlos.
Hey.
Hey, your attorney said that
you were trying to call me.
Tanner, give him a second.
You-you had something to tell
me before you were stabbed.
You remembered something about Mia?
"Sports shop."
I remembered what it meant.
Who it meant.
The night I called,
I had a dream about Mia.
I took her out on her birthday.
She saw a dude she knew.
I came out of the bathroom, and...
and she was over, talking to him.
She said he was just an old friend.
She called him something.
It wasn't "sports shop."
No, but it was close.
Okay. Uh, she said it was a nickname.
It meant, uh,
"black sheep" in another language.
Maybe German?
She say where she knew him from?
She hadn't seen him in a while.
Maybe Prague?
- Does that make any sense?
- Yes.
She was backpacking through
Europe a few years ago.
- Yes.
- Okay, Carlos,
can you give me a description?
What, tall, short?
Weight? Anything.
I don't know.
I didn't really get a good look at him.
<i>Pretty tall, I think.</i>
She took a selfie with him.
What?
She took a selfie.
It doesn't matter
if I know what he looked like.
There's a picture of him in her phone.
Thank you.
We find the picture
and we put it up on Sophe.
- One step at a time, Tanner.
- This is more than just a step.
This is like a Michael Jordan
half-court leap...
- Yeah, yeah, I get it.
- ...ripping the rim down.
It's all good, it's all good.
But even if we find the guy,
we still got to link him to the murder.
Let me ask you something.
How did you know?
How'd I know what?
How did you know that
Carlos Ochoa did not kill Mia?
- I'm not doing this right now.
- No, listen.
You-you put your ass on the line.
You kneecapped your career for it.
Do you need another black eye?
Look, I'm just saying, you did all that.
Why?
Just a feeling.
Come on.
A detective with your experience? No way.
There was something you saw.
I don't know.
Something... something felt off.
Just...
I've interrogated hundreds of killers.
He just wasn't one.
But damned if I can tell you why.
But there's one key difference
between then and now.
Sophe?
Sophe hasn't solved it.
Not yet. But we didn't have
Black Sheep until now.
This is it. I'm telling you.
We're gonna get the son
of a bitch who did this
and get Ochoa out.
Look, Tanner, you make it sound easy.
The power of positive thinking.
Well, I think you're
positively full of...
<i>Dutch.</i>
- What?
- According to the crowd,
<i>"Zwart Schaap"</i> is Dutch, not German.
'Cause that's not weirder at all.
Nice work. See?
Did Carlos say anything else?
Yes, he said there's a picture on...
Hey, hey. We're following
up on another lead.
We'll let you know if it pans out.
Under-promise, over-deliver.
Remember that.
So...
How's that going?
How's what going?
Since you and Tanner. You know.
I'm fine. It's fine.
We are fine.
You're just saying "fine" a lot
for someone who's actually fine.
Let's just concentrate
on the posts, shall we?
Let's see what other connections
this drags up.
Fine.
Dutch. Opens up a lot of avenues,
especially if it's a family nickname.
If you say so.
What's going on?
Nothing, man. It's...
It's just, I've seen you excited before.
All right? Look.
We need to take this one step at a time.
First, let's find the picture
Ochoa was talking about,
and then we'll get all...
- Hey.
- Hey.
You believe him?
Yeah. Yeah, I do.
I need you to confirm
this is your daughter.
Do we have to?
I'm afraid so.
Are you ready?
Yeah. Yeah.
Mia. Oh... No.
<i>Tanner.</i>
Tanner.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
- You good?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Um, June 9th is her birthday.
- June 9th.
- Yeah.
Did I miss it?
Is it not there? Hold on a second.
Okay, 134, 135, 136, 138...
Image 137 is missing.
Photo's gone.
Whoever this is killed Mia
and erased himself from her phone.
Best I can tell, about a dozen pictures
were erased from the phone.
And way more from the laptop.
Most from the month she spent in Europe.
He even deleted the backend logs.
He must have gone through
half a dozen levels of security.
He knew what he was doing.
Can't you just grab the
pictures from the cloud?
Mia didn't back up anything
personal on the cloud.
I taught her that. I didn't want
paparazzi to get ahold of it.
Wait a minute, didn't you
help create the cloud?
I'm a walking contradiction.
Can you guys just please
try to find that picture?
We can try.
Tanner, let me talk to you for a second.
Something you asked me earlier,
about that night.
You were right, he was trashed.
But there was something else
about Ochoa that bugged me.
How can we help?
The interrogation transcripts
made it onto Sophe, right?
- But not the actual video.
- Yeah.
I'm going back to PD
to go over the physical tapes.
I'm an idiot.
What?
I know where to find pictures of Mia...
where this monster couldn't possibly
have gotten ahold of them.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You didn't have to come down.
You could have just
sent David with the key.
I wanted to know why you wanted it.
I think there may be a picture
of Mia's killer in there.
Are you serious, Jeffrey?
Yeah. Her scrapbooks,
from when she traveled.
She made one after the Europe trip.
Yeah, but, Jeffrey,
the police went through
all of this stuff already.
But they didn't know
what they were looking for.
Hmm.
Now we do.
All right.
I, um...
It's just...
when they asked me what to do
with all of her stuff,
you know, I just, um...
couldn't deal with it.
So I just, I had two of the interns come
- and packaged it up and...
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry that I didn't help you more.
- No.
I was, you know...
I know.
Okay, so, let's do it.
You don't have to do this.
No. We face it together.
- Come on.
- Okay.
<i>Jeffrey?</i>
Jeffrey?
Remember, these are just
things, they aren't her.
- Okay. Yeah.
- Okay?
Okay? Say it.
They're just things.
They're...
They're not her.
Mr. Ochoa.
Hey.
Mr. Ochoa, do you know where you are?
What was that?
Mia.
She here?
What about Mia, Mr. Ochoa?
I...
I can't leave it like this.
You can't leave it like what?
You can't leave it like what, Carlos?
Is this how you left her?
You killed her, didn't you, Carlos?
No.
No. No.
- You were outside her place.
- No.
You got in a fight earlier.
- The neighbors overheard you.
- No.
She was breaking it off with
you, right, Carlos?
No.
Is that why you killed her, Carlos?
Because you didn't want
anyone else to have her?
Carlos.
This isn't working.
Well, where are you going?
He's strung out.
Nothing he says
will be admissible now, anyway.
We get him to crack now.
He's already cracked.
That's the problem.
Sweet dreams, Carlos.
How you feeling?
Carlos, we're gonna
ask you some questions.
Some of them we know the answers to.
- Some of them we don't.
- Your best shot
through this is just telling the truth.
I relapsed.
Yeah.
I threw away 18 months.
That's the truth.
Well, good. That's a good start.
But we're gonna need
to go back before then.
Mia Tanner.
What about Mia?
- You went to go see her.
- When?
9:30. 10:00.
The neighbors heard you arguing.
You had a fight?
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I guess we did.
She wanted to break it off, right?
No. No, no, she...
she had already broken it off.
I was trying to convince her,
but that didn't go over so well.
And so I went down to the Tenderloin,
and I found a dude that was holding,
and I bought a bag.
Why am I here?
Why do you think you're here?
Possession?
Drunk and disorderly?
Um, Mia didn't have anything
to do with this.
I...
I'm an addict.
Um, and I... I made the decision.
What?
Mia. Mia.
Who did this?
You did, Carlos.
We found you at the scene.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
<i>You have to find...</i>
you have to find
the people that did this.
I didn't do this. <i>This was not me.</i>
No, no, no, you have to find
the people that did this.
No.
That's when you decided, isn't it?
Yeah, I guess so.
He had a key to her place.
They got in a fight earlier that night.
We found his DNA on her.
And all I got is a gut feeling.
God, maybe I should have
kept my mouth shut.
Oh, my gosh.
Jeffrey, do you remember this?
Me doing all the heavy
lifting while you read?
Yes. Yes, I do.
I swear this feels like a lifetime ago.
Oh, my gosh.
Jeffrey, look at this.
Do you remember this?
Oh, my God.
Who was that? Doctor, um...
- Dr. Bloom.
- Yeah.
- We told her we didn't want to know...
- That's right.
...and she just blurted it right on out.
- "It's a girl." Yeah.
- "It's a girl."
Life's last great surprise, ruined.
Mm, not totally ruined. No.
How could somebody
do this to her? You know?
Why would they do this to her?
I don't know.
Hey, Sara.
This doesn't look good.
Mia's hard drive.
The killer didn't just erase
the pictures, he blew away the sectors.
Overwrote the data,
so there's no way to restore.
Whatever was on there,
it's gone, like, really gone.
Well...
it was always a long shot.
At least, now we know
he's extremely tech-savvy.
Which is, you know, it's another
detail for the list,
and a very useful one.
Something else?
Um, yeah, so...
- We're just worried about you.
- Yeah.
- Why?
- Well, we just found out
that you were dating Tanner,
and then we found out
that you had broke up with him.
Now you're acting, like, 24% weird.
Or 76% normal, so it could
just be a rounding error.
It's just that you're not
talking about it at all.
Because...
only Americans think you have
to talk everything to death.
We're worried about you.
You've... you've said.
This is going badly, isn't it?
I think it is.
Look, we're...
we're not just your coworkers.
Or at least, I don't think
we're just your...
Are we just your co-workers? No.
No.
You are also my friends, and
I appreciate your concern,
but Jeffrey and I would like
to keep what happened between us private.
So something did happen.
- Oh, bloody hell.
- Sara?
I think you need to see this.
Thank you, Megan.
You have no idea what
you just saved me from.
Excuse me.
This just came in.
He said it was about Carlos Ochoa.
That it might be important.
You can't run away from us forever.
We still work here.
Megan, how would you like
to take over their jobs?
- Mister...?
- Glennon.
- Glennon.
- Mr. Glennon. How can I help?
You're trying to find
who killed Mia Tanner, right?
Yes. Do you know something
that could help us?
Well, I don't know who killed her,
but I know who didn't.
Carlos Ochoa.
See, uh, I was with him that night.
I guess I'm his alibi.
See, the thing you have to understand is,
up until a few weeks ago,
I was still married.
And my wife wasn't, uh...
Understanding?
Yes. Precisely.
But now the divorce is finalized...
And there's a new Mrs. Glennon?
Oh, no. No, I'm not making
that mistake again.
Uh... I-I've just been
living with this for a year,
and now I can finally speak up.
I just, I'm... I'm sorry
I didn't come forward before...
Wait, so you were with Carlos Ochoa?
He was there when I went in.
Went in where?
My room. At the...
...City Center Hotel.
It's a-a...
Gentleman's hotel.
Yeah.
Yeah. I was there maybe... two hours.
Um, and...
when I got to the room,
he was passed out,
high as a kite, right outside my door.
And then,
when I came out, he was still there.
Are you sure it was him?
Yeah. Positive.
I-I remember 'cause his face
was all over the news, but I couldn't...
Right, right, right.
I don't suppose you kept the receipt?
No, not really that kind of place.
What about your date?
Can she corroborate any of this?
Uh, I mean...
she could, if you can find her.
Well, maybe at the, uh, City Center...
Hotel.
At least, that's where she, um...
worked, back then, anyway.
Hey. Hey, you, Destiny.
Hey, hey, stop right there.
You are Destiny, right?
Standing around isn't a crime.
I'm not vice, I just got some questions.
Hey, if I was trying to entrap
you, would I hit my siren?
Come on.
Just give me a few minutes.
Lucky for you, you're so handsome.
There we go. Okay.
All right.
Easy does it.
What is that?
Okay, now, Jeffrey,
even if we don't find anything in here,
coming here was still worth it,
right? Do you agree?
Okay, here's Prague.
That's it?
Ugh!
Hey, Jeffrey?
- Jeffrey?
- I can't.
You can.
Look.
Jeffrey, look.
Do you know any of these people?
No, which means that...
He could be one of them.
<i>Which one is he?</i>
Which one's what?
Black Sheep... is he one of them?
Right here.
I-I don't know. I...
I-I only saw him once.
He was wearing a hat.
He could... he could be
any one of those dudes.
Yeah, but you said that
you could identify him, right?
No. That's why I told you
about the picture in the phone.
No, no, there is... The picture's gone.
All right? He deleted it.
Okay?
So, please, just-just
look one more time, Carlos.
Okay, that's enough for now.
Jeffrey.
Please.
Doctor, is he gonna be okay?
I mean, this is...
The problem is they're gonna return him
to the prison hospital soon.
- What?
- Wait. They can't.
- He can't be moved like that.
- Technically, he can.
The pericardial tamponade
drained the fluid
and relieves the pressure from his heart.
But the next few days are critical.
- He needs to be monitored closely.
- Okay.
He can't get that in a
prison hospital, trust me.
Well, then we can't
move him to a prison hospital.
Right, but it's not
that simple, Mr. Tanner.
The Department of Corrections
does what it does.
I'm on it. I'll call.
- Okay.
- I should get back in there.
All right.
Should be heading this way.
Hey, baby boy.
I remember you. Where you been?
Oh, man. Okay.
Yeah. He wasn't so embarrassed
when he was calling me "Mommy""
I remember that night, sure.
This kid was wrecked out of his mind,
passed out by the door.
And you'd be willing to
give a written statement
of everything you
remember from that night?
Wait. Hold up.
Um... I meant to say, I <i>think</i> I remember.
Uh-huh.
Yeah. If you want me to fully remember...
I got to get paid.
It doesn't quite work like that.
Didn't the guy that started this thing
offer up a hundred mil for help?
Come on. This has to be worth
at least, like, what?
50 grand?
Look, tell us what you know,
and we'll see what we can do.
Man, please.
My memory's fading by the second.
Sara, we pay criminal informants
at PD all the time.
That is a slippery slope.
Once you pay her, other people
start wanting to be paid, too.
Money distorts user motivation.
Someone has information that we need?
Yes.
Okay. Pay 'em.
Jeffrey, we've discussed this.
Sophe isn't about doling money out.
Yeah, but we offered a reward.
Which you intended would be split
among everyone that participated.
The reward was to grab attention.
People are returning because
of the day-to-day interaction.
It's not about cash,
it's about community.
If we lose that, we lose everything.
Sara, I hear everything you're saying,
and everything you're saying
is true, but right now,
- I don't care. Pay 'em.
- All right, great.
Just let them know
it's urgent. Thanks.
I have a call in to Kamala's office
and to Sacramento, but they're
not sure if we can stop them
from transferring Carlos.
Why should anything be easy?
Okay, can you please
put this up on Sophe?
Where's it from?
Mia's scrapbook
from her trip to Europe.
Could be nothing, but we...
I get it.
I get it, all right?
None of this is gonna work out.
I'm chasing a ghost.
I'm the only one that cares.
It's fine, all right?
I'll do it alone.
Okay, on that note...
Do you fancy a drink?
I know that...
Sophe wasn't something...
that you were okay with.
I should've made Jeffrey
talk to you about it, but...
Please, Sara.
Nobody can get him to do
anything he doesn't want to do.
Good point.
Besides, it's not that
I don't want to find out
what really happened. I do.
Just, when I think about
whoever did this to Mia, you know, I...
I don't know... how...
I would be able
to forgive them, you know.
For the longest time...
it was Carlos's face,
and...
I just wanted to punish him...
and hate him...
Wanting justice isn't unreasonable.
Sara, it wasn't about justice.
It was about vengeance.
I want to see
whoever did this to my daughter
burn in hell.
Instead,
someone else might lose
their baby as well.
That isn't an option.
It can't be.
What-What's wrong? What is that?
Our, um, informants.
Something felt wrong about them,
so-so I put their picture up
on Sophe, and...
they're married.
They're bloody con artists.
Stop him! Stop him now. Now!
Hey! Hey!
You son of a bitch!
You want to make money
off my daughter's death?!
- Hey, hey!
- Jeffrey! No!
Get off.
Get off. Come on.
- Come on.
- I got him. All right. I'm all right.
- You good?
- Yeah.
Huh?
You want some of this?
- Take it. Take it all.
- All right, okay...
Okay, so run me through
Black Sheep again.
Mia has this on-again,
off-again thing with Ochoa.
All right, during this time,
she reconnects with this guy.
Probably a rich kid, jealous type.
Maybe he finds out
Mia and Carlos are still
hooking up, gets pissed,
and makes her break it off with him.
She's forcing him out the door because
this Black Sheep is on his way over.
The question is:
why didn't she call the cops?
Do I really have to run down
domestic abuse stats for you?
So, she...
she thinks that he's gonna be jealous,
- but that he won't hurt her.
- Okay.
Tanner said that Mia always
saw the best in people, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, he did.
All right, let's just go over it again.
Hold up.
What, you see something?
Can you pull up this shot
from the first interrogation?
Yeah.
You see it?
The logo is gone.
Why'd he switch clothes?
<i>So the roster says
you were on the desk</i>
the night of September 26th to the 27th?
If you say so. The nights
all blend together for me.
This was a big one.
The night Mia Tanner was murdered.
Oh, yeah, the night
Ochoa came in. That was me.
At some point during the night,
his clothes were changed.
For the evidence search.
After that.
He was in a pair of PD scrubs,
but in the morning,
he was wearing a different pair.
You remember why?
Yeah, because was
puking all over himself.
Here.
After you guys released him
from interrogation,
about an hour or so after that,
he started getting sick,
coming out of both ends,
so I called a medic.
They checked him out, put him on fluids.
We trashed the old clothes
and put him in new ones.
Why weren't we told about this?
He was a junkie coming down.
He never even left his cell.
The medic said it was heroin.
That or food poisoning.
Frankly, I didn't care then,
and I really don't care now.
You're true blue, Hoff.
Hey, you know what?
At least I didn't...
Don't finish that sentence.
Food poisoning.
Maybe. It could have been anything.
But it's still something
we didn't know before.
It's a start.
Sara, I got something for Sophe.
Hey-hey. Hi.
I think you've hit
enough things for one day, don't you?
If you need time to sulk,
I can come back.
Jeffrey, look, I know this is painful.
And you have been staring
at this thing in the face
every single day.
It sucks.
But that's too damn bad.
This was your choice.
My choice?
I never had a choice.
I was the only one that believed
her real killer was still out there.
What... So what do you want?
Do you want a trophy?
Jeffrey, your entire life,
you've built up walls
around you to keep people out,
to sabotage relationships...
your parents,
me, Mia, and now those people downstairs.
At some point,
you're gonna have to realize
that this is nobody's fault but your own.
You decided to pick up this boulder.
Now you have to continue
to carry it up the hill.
I would stop moping and get back to work.
You'd think, considering
it's after midnight,
we'd have less users.
Well, everyone has a great
"one time I puked" story.
This one time,
when I was eight years old,
I drank three cans of orange soda,
and puked all over my cousin.
He's never forgiven me to this day.
That's nothing.
I once, um, met this-this bloke
in a pub, after school...
Rupert? Something or other.
Anyway, after about five pints too many,
we went outside to snog and I...
- No.
- Oh!
Come on. It was terrible.
I was mortified.
It was so horrible.
That's disgusting.
You guys okay?
Yeah, sorry.
We are all... fine.
I-It's the picture
from Mia's scrapbook.
We found one of the men.
Who is it?
Olivier Durand.
He was in France
at the time of the murder,
so it can't have been him,
but he may know something.
See if he can talk to us,
and we'll take it in my office.
<i>Mr. Tanner, Ms. Hale,</i>
I'm so sorry about Mia.
I did not know her well,
but she was lovely.
Yeah, she was.
Thank you.
So you met her in Prague?
Yes. Um, just for a day or two.
I followed the story here.
I would have reached out,
but I had no idea
there was anything I could do.
Was there another man,
when you were with her?
Someone that she had a nickname
for, like, a-a Dutch name.
Yes. In fact, there was.
I only met him for a few minutes, though.
Uh, and he's in the photograph?
Unfortunately, no.
Um, he would have been, but...
he's actually the one
who took the photograph.
Is there anything that you can
remember that would help us?
Anything at all?
Well, there may be
one other thing, actually.
I remember, I asked Mia
how she knew this man.
And she said...
she said she knew him
through you, Mr. Tanner.
Uh... Okay, well, thank you
so much for your help.
Of course.
Uh, y-you should come and see this.
So we ran the, um, vomit question.
But when we put it up on Sophe,
we discovered a pattern.
Well, a-an outbreak, actually.
<i>Clostridium perfringens.</i>
It's a bacterium
that causes food poisoning.
A number of our users report getting it
the night of Mia's death.
And one of our users is an ER nurse
who says she that treated
at least a dozen cases of it that night.
She checked the records,
and they all are tied up to this place.
This street fair, and more specifically,
this food cart.
They all ate there.
Where was this street fair?
About two miles from Mia's apartment.
- Right by the Tenderloin.
- Okay, so...
So Ochoa gets high,
goes to the street fair,
eats poisoned pig...
And then, he goes back to Mia's place
where we pick him up outside.
Which means that he could've
been at this street fair
at the time that Mia was killed.
Well, that's all well and good,
but we still have to prove it.
Well, we better do it quickly.
They're transferring Ochoa
back to the prison hospital
- first thing tomorrow.
- I have a call into the judge...
Well, we need to go higher up than that.
Well, I can head up to Solano,
and see if we can stall them.
Can I come?
Yes, ma'am.
Ladies and gentlemen.
It's time to save Carlos Ochoa's life.
I'm not finding anything on Carlos.
Even if we find him there,
how do we stop them
from moving him back to prison?
Alex is on it.
We just need to find something
for her to work with.
We're getting lots of partials.
This is gonna take forever.
Guys, I've got something here.
What?
This guy, he-he takes
ultra-high-resolution gigapixel photos
using a computer-controlled camera.
The organizers of the event
hired him to take this.
You can't make
out anybody on this thing.
I mean, it's too wide.
Yeah, until you zoom in.
That's what's so special
about a gigapixel photo.
The clarity is perfect,
no matter how close you are.
That's so awesome.
Yeah. Okay,
now we're looking for a needle
in a stack of needles?
Yeah, that's where Sophe comes in.
Divide and conquer.
A crowd speciality.
We'll get each user to examine
a chunk of the picture,
they'll say yes or no to it,
and then, they'll move
on to another chunk.
We'll build in a system of doubles
to make sure there's overlap
and multiple eyes everywhere.
Now, doing the math.
This photo's from 11:01 p.m.
Time of death is between 10:30 and 11:00.
Yeah. This is two miles
from Mia's apartment.
It's late, cabs are a
huge pain in this area,
e-especially with an event going on.
There's no way he would've got
to her place in that window.
If Carlos is in this picture,
it proves he didn't kill Mia.
Yeah, it's an urgent matter.
I know that it's early,
but I... I know. No, I realize that,
- and I'm sorry for calling so early,
- Alex, please!
- But...
- Sorry, hold on.
- I need to call you back.
- They're taking him.
Ma'am, we were given orders to move him.
I understand that, but we're
gonna need a couple of hours.
Okay, well, I'm sorry, Lieutenant,
but we were given orders.
You're a little out
of your jurisdiction up here.
Okay, no. Officer.
Officer Crosby, do you know who I am?
Yes, Congresswoman.
Okay. Perfect, good.
This man was wrongfully convicted
of murdering my daughter.
Right now, we're trying
to prove his innocence,
clear his name,
so he can be released.
If you take him back to
prison, he will die.
Look at me.
I need you to leave him here,
make sure that he's safe and secure,
and if you don't follow my instructions,
I will destroy you.
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?
Yes, ma'am.
Then, go.
Okay.
I've got a good one.
Damn it, it's not him.
Of course it isn't.
Hey.
You good?
It's not my day.
It ain't over yet.
The guy from Mia's scrapbook,
- who I talked to?
- Yeah?
He said that she knows about
Black Sheep because of me.
I introduced her to him.
Tanner, it's not your fault.
- Yeah.
- Look, man.
You can't try to find meaning
in everything.
- Yeah.
- The only thing that got us here now
is an interrogation room camera
pointing in the right angle.
That's the hardest part of this job.
I mean, yeah, sure.
Training, experience, it means something.
But so does luck.
The truth is,
I could've been completely wrong.
But you weren't.
But what happens
when it goes the other way?
When I am convinced
an innocent person is guilty,
and I do everything I can
to make it stick?
We've got something.
Come on.
It's not over.
Let's go.
Okay.
Cross everything.
And there he is.
With a bacon-wrapped hot dog.
We did it?
We did it.
We did it!
Yeah, good job, good job.
It worked.
Thank you, for everything.
Sure.
I mean, any chance
I get to yell at you, and...
point out one of your many, many flaws,
I'm gonna happily take it.
Yes.
- I get that.
- Mm-hmm.
You're gonna find
the son of a bitch, Jeffrey.
I know that you will.
We will.
