Hello.
Say, I was wondering...
What?
Sorry. I was wondering
if you'd like to dance?
Why not?
Kitty, who was the young man you
were dancing with last night?
Which one?
The quiet, serious-looking one.
Oh, him.
I suppose you invited him, Mother.
I don't know who you're talking about.
I invited him.
His name is Fane and he's a doctor.
He manages a
government laboratory in Shanghai.
A civil servant?
In any case.
He called 'round last Sunday,
we had a long chat.
I told him to come back anytime.
It's not often that you
like any of my young men.
Well, do you like him?
Not really.
- What's wrong with him?
- Is he in love with you?
I don't know.
I should have thought by
now you'd know when a
young man was in love with you.
The point is whether or not
I'm in love with him. And I'm not.
You'd better be careful, young lady.
Time can run out, you know.
Oh, stop it, Mother. Honestly.
The very idea that a woman should marry
any Tom, Dick, or Harry...
...regardless of her own feelings
is simply prehistoric.
How much longer do you expect your
father to go on supporting you?
Oh.
Hello.
- Hello. I...
I was just coming...
Your father invited me.
I'm going out.
May I join you?
Right on time.
What is it exactly that you do?
I'm a bacteriologist.
That must be fascinating.
You have no idea what that is, do you?
No. I'm afraid not.
No, there's no reason you should.
I study the microorganisms
that carry disease.
Charming.
No, it's not
actually. It's the opposite.
Shall we step inside?
Do you like flowers?
Not particularly, no.
Well, I mean, yes.
But we don't really have
them around the house.
Mother says, "Why purchase
something you can grow for free?"
But then we don't really
grow them either.
It does seem silly, really.
To put all that effort into something
that's just going to die.
I'd like to say something to you.
I came to see you to
ask you if you'll marry me.
You could knock me down with a feather.
Could you not tell
that I'm in love with you?
You never showed it.
Oh, I'd...
Well, I wanted to. It's difficult. I...
But there it is.
Right.
I'm not sure that's very well put.
No, it's not.
Do you see how clumsy I am? I...
I'm terrible at these sorts of things.
But the thing is
I've got to get back to China very soon.
I don't have time to be cautious.
I've never thought of you in that way.
I think I improve greatly
upon acquaintance.
Oh, I'm sure you do...
I'd do anything in my power
to make you happy.
Anything at all.
I think you'd like Shanghai.
It's quite exciting, it is.
Lots of dancing.
Surely you're not
expecting me to answer this second?
I don't know you at all.
Yes! Well, we had the
highest of hopes, but...
...I had no expectation
that he'd ask her so soon.
Yes. A lovely late autumn wedding.
She's done very well for
her herself, has my Doris.
At least one of them's made a success.
No, I gave up on Kitty ages ago.
Yes.
Yes.
Well, I know you understand. Yes.
Well?
Is it smaller than you imagined?
I'm not sure what I imagined.
Don't you have a piano?
No, I don't play the piano.
Who is it?
It's I.
Come in.
Just wanted to see
So, then, you're comfortable, then?
Do you need anything?
No.
I'm fine.
Thank you.
Good. Good.
I'm so happy you're here.
Shall I shut the lamp?
What for?
I'll shut the lamp.
It's raining cats and dogs.
I said, it's raining cats and dogs.
Yes, I heard you.
You might have answered.
I'm sorry.
I've gotten used to not speaking...
...unless I have something to say.
If nobody spoke unless
they had something to say...
...the human race would soon
lose the power of speech.
Walter.
I'm sorry.
You're right.
What shall we do? Shall we...
...shall we play a game?
You don't like the
games I play. They bore you.
Nonsense.
Let's play cards.
Do you think you'd enjoy a night out?
We have an
invitation for Saturday night.
From whom?
The Townsends.
Dorothy Townsend.
Do you not like her?
Well, I've only met her once,
but there's no reason
for her to put on such airs.
Does she? Yes. I have no idea why.
She was what? Married to a vice consul?
Honestly, they're absurd,
this Shanghai set.
Mother wouldn't dream of asking
half of them to dinner.
I'm taking that black five.
Well, it's all right.
I thought you might enjoy it,
but we certainly don't have to go.
I don't care either way.
Go where?
- Kitty Fane?
- Hello, Dorothy.
I'm so glad you could come.
This is Walter.
I'm pleased to meet you.
This is my husband.
Charlie, stop
talking and greet our guests.
- You know Mr. Fane.
- Charlie.
It's Dr. Fane, darling.
Oh, dear. I do beg your
pardon, Dr. Fane.
Not at all.
And this is Dr. Fane's wife, Kitty.
Mrs. Fane.
Mr. Townsend.
I do apologize, Dr. Fane.
I assumed you worked
with Charlie at the consulate.
Oh, no. Nothing so glamorous.
I'm at the Civil Laboratory.
The government lab? How fascinating.
Are you enjoying it?
I've never seen anything like it.
Every gesture has a meaning.
See how she covers
her face with the cloth?
She is mourning her misfortune.
What happened to her?
She was sold into slavery.
Condemned to a life
of drudgery and despair...
...in a strange land far from home.
See the chains?
They represent the heavy bondage
of her poor trapped soul...
...from which there is no escape.
And so she weeps.
She weeps for the lively,
vivacious girl she once was...
...for the lonely woman she has become.
And most of all...
...she weeps for the love
she'll never feel...
...for the love she'll never give.
Is that really what she's saying?
Actually, I haven't a clue
what she's on about.
I don't speak Chinese.
What was that?
Perhaps it was the
amah, or one of the...
They've gone.
He heard us.
Who?
Walter.
Walter. What if it was?
For all he knows you were taking a nap.
With my doors locked?
Kitty, dear, you need a drink.
Even if it was, my
impression is he'll do nothing.
That's flattering.
He knows as well as anyone...
...there's nothing to be
gained by making a scandal.
Has it occurred to you that my
husband is in love with me?
I have a feeling you're about
to say something awful.
It's just that women are
often under the impression that...
...men are much more in love
with them than they really are.
I wouldn't delude myself for a second
that you were in love with me.
Now there you're wrong.
Do you like your present?
It's good enough.
Charlie?
Do I make you as happy as you make me?
Of course you do, darling.
"Miss you Father"
- Hassan?
- Yes?
- Who brought this package 'round?
- Dr. Fane.
When?
While you sleeping.
It's nearly midday.
We could stop up here under the trees...
...but I'd like to press
on if it's all right with you.
Certainly, my
comfort's of no concern to you.
Right. Then we'll continue.
Charlie Townsend, please.
Charles Townsend.
I need to see you.
Kitty, I can't possibly see you.
I've got a meeting
in an hour at the club.
What is it?
I have to go.
What are you doing home?
I'm sorry. There's something I
need to speak with you about.
Actually, I was just
about to take my bath.
I'm afraid it's rather important,
darling. Can't wait.
Sit down.
Do you know a
place called Mei-Tan-Fu?
No.
Well, it was in the
papers the other day.
It's a small town on a tributary
of the Yangtze River,
in the interior.
They've had an
outbreak of cholera there.
It's the worst epidemic anyone's
seen in a long time.
The Chinese medical officer has died.
There's a convent of French nuns and
they're trying to run the hospital...
...and they're doing the best that they
can, but people are dropping like flies.
I have volunteered to
go and to take charge.
Why?
Because they need a doctor.
But you're not a doctor.
You're a bacteriologist.
I'm an M.D.
The fact that I'm foremost
a scientist...
...is actually all
to the good in this case.
Won't it be awfully dangerous?
I suppose it might, yes.
Now, Mei-Tan-Fu
is a ten-day journey.
You can go by rail for the first
part of it, but after that it's carriage...
...and then we'll
have to take a sedan chair.
Who's we?
Why, you and I, of course.
You're not expecting me to come too?
I hoped that if I was going
you would want to go.
Surely it's no place for a woman.
It would be madness
for me to go. Why should I?
To cheer and comfort me?
No.
No, I won't go.
In fact, it's
monstrous of you to even ask me.
Fine. Then I shall file my petition
for divorce tomorrow.
I'm afraid that you have
thought me a bigger fool than I am.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Don't you?
I am divorcing you for adultery.
I am naming Charles Townsend
as your lover.
I'm sorry, Walter.
I realize this is very unpleasant, but,
please, let's not make
this uglier than it needs to be.
By all means. What is it that
you propose that we should do?
You could let me divorce you quietly.
You divorce me?
- On what grounds, may I ask?
- That's what a gentleman would do.
Can you give me one reason I should put myself
to the smallest inconvenience on your account?
Please, Walter, don't be so hateful.
We didn't mean to hurt anyone. But...
...Charlie and I have fallen in love.
He wants to marry me.
Really?
I knew that you weren't the
cleverest girl in the world...
...but I didn't know
that you were actually a fool.
Yes. Well, if it makes you
feel better to hurt me,
then go ahead.
But you might as well get used to it.
We love each other.
And we're sick to death
of the secrecy...
...and compromise
and all the rest of it.
And now you curse the day
that you ever met me.
Stop mocking me.
There's no other response...
...for such pathetic behavior!
It's comic.
When I think about how hard
I've tried to make you happy.
Debasing myself! Acting as though
I was as thrilled as you...
...by the latest gossip
and as vulgar and as ignorant...
...of the world as you are!
- Shut up!
If you interrupt me again,
I'll strangle you.
Sit down.
I knew when I married you that
you were selfish and spoiled.
But I loved you.
I knew that you married me...
...only to get as far away from
your mother as possible...
...and I hoped that one day...
...there'd be something more.
I was wrong.
You don't have it in you.
If a man hasn't what's necessary
to make a woman love him,
then it's his fault...
...not hers.
Either way.
Tomorrow morning we are
to leave for Mei-Tan-Fu,
or I shall file my petition.
Walter, you can't be serious
about taking me...
...into the middle
of a cholera epidemic.
Do you think that I'm not?
My God.
That's what you want, isn't it?
Do you really think Charlie
will let you do this?
I don't think Charlie has
very much to say about it.
Everything you said is true.
Everything.
I married you even though
I didn't love you.
But you knew that.
Aren't you as much to
blame for what's happened as I?
All right.
Here's what I'll do.
Gentlemen, we all have
assets to protect here.
Unfortunately, Mr. Nagata's actions...
...have created a rather
urgent situation.
It was an unfortunate,
but unavoidable incident.
Your foreman shot a worker.
He was an agitator.
He was a Chinese.
You may have
suppressed a very small strike...
...but in doing so you have started...
...a very large demonstration.
I need to use your pen, please.
Here you are, miss.
What about support from
Chiang Kai-shek?
Where does he stand on this?
He's a Nationalist. He will stand
on the side of the Chinese.
That's why they call themselves
Nationalists.
Excuse me.
Mr. Townsend.
I think you
underestimated the situation.
I have three of my mills
shut down because of walk-outs.
There is talk about boycotts.
So, what do you propose?
A handful of municipal
soldiers is hardly a show of force.
If you'll excuse me.
Mrs. Fane. What a pleasant surprise.
You've rescued me from
a pack of wild bores.
I wouldn't have come if
it wasn't necessary.
Are you all right?
I needed to see you. I'm sorry.
Kitty, this is not the
most opportune time for me to...
He knows.
Right.
After you, Mrs. Fane.
Hello, Charlie. Hello, George.
Hello, Townsend.
Adam.
He wants a divorce.
You didn't commit yourself, did you?
Acknowledge anything?
No.
Are you sure?
Quite sure.
Well.
This is a bloody scrape we're in.
He says he has proof.
We deny it.
He can't prove anything.
Besides, it wouldn't do Walter
any good to create a scandal.
But there isn't going to be a scandal.
Walter's agreed to let
me divorce him quietly.
That's not so terrible, is it?
Will you hold me?
Of course I will.
Oh, God.
Charlie?
His offer comes with a condition.
I'm not a rich man.
He doesn't want your money.
He's agreed to let me divorce him...
...if Dorothy will agree to divorce you.
And if...
What?
If you'll promise to marry me.
You know, darling, whatever happens,
we must try to keep Dorothy out of it.
What do you mean?
We can't only think of ourselves.
I know Dorothy.
Nothing in the world
will induce her to divorce me.
You don't want to divorce her.
It's not just a
question of my marriage...
Then what is it?
Do you have any idea of the importance
of my station here?
If I were...
Why are you laughing?
I don't think Walter
intended for one minute to divorce me.
He knew you'd let me down.
Try to understand.
I understand, all right.
Kitty! Kitty, please.
We'll work this out, I promise. D...
I'm coming with you.
Good. I thought you might.
I suppose I needn't take more
than a few summer things?
And a shroud?
I've told Hassan what you will need.
She's packing already.
I wouldn't touch that if I was you.
They may have died in that bed.
This can be your room.
You must be the doctor's wife.
I've just met your husband...
...and invited myself to dinner.
I've kept the Watsons' cook for you.
She's not bad.
She'll have to do as your amah as well.
We're a little short-handed here.
Sorry, my name is Waddington.
Oh, yes, of course. Kitty Fane.
I'm the Deputy Commissioner.
Please.
I believe you're one of our neighbors.
Only neighbor, I'm afraid.
Last one standing.
And Watson was the missionary
living here?
Yes. Nice fellow.
American. Lovely family.
I'll show you their
graves tomorrow, if you like.
How kind of you.
I hope your journey wasn't too arduous?
We've been traveling for two weeks.
Two weeks? What did you do, swim?
No, we didn't come
up river. Came overland.
Whatever for?
Well, we wanted to take
in a bit of the countryside.
Get a bit of sun. Didn't we, darling?
Anyone for a cocktail?
Here's luck.
I was told I might get some help
from the local army officer.
Colonel Yu, is it?
Good luck with him.
He's not fond of us British.
Listen, I'll warn you,
things are pretty dicey even out here.
I'm afraid that if the
cholera doesn't get us,
the Nationalists might.
Tried to get those nuns to go,
but they refused.
They all want to be martyrs, damn them.
And why have you stayed?
I was posted here. Simple as that.
I was shocked to hear you'd volunteered.
Opportunity for research.
I couldn't pass it up.
Yes. And you?
I don't suppose you've come to
Mei-Tan-Fu for the research.
My husband's the scientist.
Indeed.
Did you have any
reaction to the inoculation?
You have been inoculated?
Yes, of course.
No guarantee. The Watsons were
inoculated, it didn't do them much good.
Have you brought any gramophone records?
No, unfortunately not.
Pity. I'm sick of all mine.
Listen.
What's all that?
Across the river.
Trying to frighten
off the spirit of death.
I'm going to town in the morning.
Have a look around.
I expect you'll want to rest.
I can inoculate you in the evening.
Will you be doing yourself?
No, I don't think so.
You needn't bother with me then.
Suit yourself.
Tell me, Walter.
Is it a long, drawn-out affair,
dying of cholera?
No. All of the fluid goes out of you...
...in the first 36 hours.
You die of dehydration, actually.
So, it's messy and very painful.
But it is relatively quick.
Good night.
It's rather unfortunate.
I thought perhaps
that you and your wife...
...you'd like to take precautions
in case you have to leave this place.
Do you think all
this is really necessary?
You can see the picture.
I thought you'd like
to put your wife's mind...
...at rest from this situation.
This is Colonel Yu. He's the KMT's man.
He's posting one of
his men here at the house.
Am I a prisoner?
No. It was Mr. Waddington's
idea actually.
He feels we should take precautions.
Precautions against what?
A few days ago,
British troops opened fire...
...on a group of Chinese workers
who were demonstrating in Shanghai.
Eleven were killed.
We've only just heard.
Those were plastered around
the town last night.
I shouldn't worry too much.
Even the Nationalists
are afraid of cholera.
Do they take that water from the well?
Colonel, can I see where they
get their drinking water?
For starters, we've
got to stop people from...
...using this well until I can test it.
Do you understand?
Yes, I understand, Dr. Fane.
I received my
military training in Moscow.
If you don't like English,
we can speak Russian.
English will be fine. Thank you.
Here.
You have seen
cholera before, yes, Doctor?
At the laboratory, of course.
No, I mean in a patient.
No. No, I haven't had the chance
Well, I'm not a clinician.
Did they not tell you?
I'm an infectious disease specialist.
Shall we? After you, Doctor.
Charlie
without you it is intolerable
I don't need you.
Go back!
Mr. Waddington?
I'm looking for Mr. Waddington.
Wait here. All right?
Hello?
Mr. Waddington?
Mrs. Fane?
Good morning.
What can I do for you, Mrs. Fane?
I found a record for you.
Stravinsky.
Very modern. Thank you.
Was there something else?
I was wondering if you could tell me...
...when the post comes through.
It's for Shanghai.
Unfortunately, since the cholera,
the cowards won't venture
past the river port...
...but leave it with me.
A local trader I know is
making the trip on Friday.
Townsend.
Charlie Townsend?
Yes. He's an acquaintance of my husband.
Do you know him?
Years ago. We were both assigned
to the consulate in Shanghai.
Charming wife?
Yes. They're very popular, aren't they?
He'd made a science of popularity.
So, you know his family?
Well, well enough. I like Dorothy.
Yes, I understand
they're quite the devoted couple.
Oh, he had his little flirtations.
Nothing serious.
I once heard her say that
she found it most unflattering...
...that the women
who fell for her husband...
...were so consistently second-rate.
Well, enjoy the record.
Mrs. Fane?
The letter.
Right.
Yes, it suddenly occurred to me
that Friday's much too late.
Thanks all the same.
Can you pass the salt, please?
I'm sorry. Did you say something?
Could you pass the salt?
Thank you.
So, this is how it's going to be?
Passing her evenings in silence.
Walter.
Walter!
I wonder if you haven't gone insane.
- She's not cooking it.
- Leave it.
Leave it.
Thank you.
Are you looking to kill yourself?
Town well's contaminated.
This is dirty. It's dirty.
What?
Mr. Waddington?
Mrs. Fane?
Mrs. Fane!
Come away. Come away.
What's the matter with Te-Ming?
You have the dead man on you.
They're very superstitious, aren't they?
She's lost three children and
a husband to the cholera.
So, you can hardly blame her.
You know,
this is no place for a woman.
When they telegraphed me that you were
coming out, I was astonished.
I imagined you might be
a grim-visaged old nurse...
...with thick legs and a mustache.
I came into the bungalow
and there you were...
...frail and tired...
...and very unhappy.
It was a long journey.
But you're unhappy now.
And it occurred to me that you and your
husband might be madly in love...
...and that you'd
simply refused to stay behind.
That's a reasonable explanation.
Yes. But it's not the right one.
Do you know what I find strange?
That your husband should
never look at you.
He looks at the
walls, the floor, his shoes.
He has a great deal on his mind.
Yes, I'm sure of it.
Dr. Fane!
Dr. Fane!
Oh, God.
All right.
What are you doing?
Martini?
Yes?
I'm the bearer of a
message from the Mother Superior.
Who?
The nun who supervises the
orphanage and the hospital.
I didn't know she was
aware of my existence.
Well, apparently Mr. Waddington
has spoken of you.
She would very much
like to meet the loving...
...loyal wife of the
compassionate Dr. Fane.
Right. Then I must
prepare myself for the charade.
She does understand if you...
...don't want to venture
into the center of the epidemic.
If you're not afraid, why should I be?
I forgot.
Walter!
Oh, my God!
Oh, you're drunk.
Don't expect anything grand.
They're miserably poor.
Hello.
It's a great pleasure to
make the acquaintance
of the wife of our good
and brave doctor.
Lovely to meet you, too.
Mr. Waddington.
You must eat the madeleines.
Sister St. Joseph made them
for you herself this morning.
So, tell me, Mrs. Fane.
To which faith do you subscribe?
Excuse me.
We attended services,
not religiously regularly.
You could say I'm a
member of the Church of England.
Which is an
inoffensive way of saying you
don't quite believe in anything much.
You're very pretty.
And very young.
I assure you I'm not. I feel ancient.
If Mrs. Fane would like
to see over the convent...
...and orphanage. I shall
be glad to show her.
Alone.
We keep the older girls
busy with sewing.
It keeps them occupied.
And earns money for the convent.
That one won't allow us to baptize her.
Our music room.
Sister Maryse.
Sister Dominique was our pianist.
She died last week. Cholera.
Through there is the infirmary.
It is not a sight one would wish to see.
Shall I call Dr. Fane out to see you?
No. You needn't disturb him.
Now, with the epidemic...
...we have even more to care for.
This baby was brought in this morning.
Another orphan.
She says Dr. Fane loves babies.
He spends as much time as
he can in the nursery.
Mrs. Fane?
Mrs. Fane?
You all right?
Yes.
It's nothing...
...only foolishness.
What do you want?
Sorry.
I brought you your supper.
All right. Just leave it there.
Is there something else?
What's that you're doing?
I am testing the nitrate
levels of a local tomato.
Why?
Why?
Can't possibly interest you.
Well, enjoy your supper.
Walter.
What do you propose we should
do if we get through the epidemic?
I have no ideas.
But I don't think any good will come...
...of always talking about
a situation that we
should do much better to forget.
But you don't forget.
Please. I really must work.
Won't you listen to what I have to say?
All right. If you insist.
It's, it's just today, having...
...been at the convent with those nuns.
What have they done, converted you?
No.
They spoke of you.
And it made me feel...
What?
- It made you feel what?
- I think I've been afraid of you.
Well, you should have been.
Excuse me.
If, if I can't work, I'm going to bed.
I know you're angry at me. But if we
could just try and talk about...
Honestly, I don't understand you.
What is it that you want from me?
Perhaps I just want us to be a little
less unhappy.
You're mistaken in thinking
that I'm unhappy.
I have far too much to
do here to think of
you very much at all.
That's exactly what I'm trying to say.
I feel useless.
What do you propose that I do about
that? For God's sakes, Walter!
Will you stop punishing me?
Do you absolutely despise me?
No. I despise myself.
Why?
For allowing myself to love you once.
Hello.
I hope I haven't come at
an inconvenient time.
Sister Maryse died last night.
I've just written to inform her parents.
I'm so sorry.
But it is sinful of me to grieve...
...when I know that her good and simple
soul has flown straight to heaven.
How can I help you?
Well, I'm sure that
with the sister's death...
...you must be even more shorthanded.
You see, I was wondering if
I could come to the convent...
...and do anything just,
just to help out.
My dear child, don't you
think you've done enough...
...coming here with your husband?
I've been here a month.
Believe me, I have nothing to
do from morning till night.
Perhaps I could help with the
sisters in the hospital.
That is impossible.
Cholera is a terrible thing to see.
Besides, what would
happen if you should fall ill?
I'd be happy to
scrub the floors, anything...
...just something to feel useful.
That will not be necessary.
The orphans scrub the floors.
No, no, it is our business and
our privilege to do such things.
But there is always more to do each day.
Have you spoken to
your husband of your wish?
Yes.
I don't know what you're saying.
I also found traces in the river,
downstream from the burial grounds.
You've checked these results?
I tested it three times.
Well, that's it then.
I would recommend barricading
the bathing area...
...cut off all access to the river.
How far do you expect people
to walk for their water?
I've no idea.
Up river, at least a
half-mile above the burial ground.
That's too far.
Nevertheless.
I agree with Dr. Fane.
It's necessary.
Also, I thought we'd
agreed to post a directive...
...ordering people to dispose
of the corpses immediately.
We have done that already, Doctor.
Yes, but if you don't
enforce it then it doesn't matter.
Because the families are hiding
the bodies for days.
Then they bury them too
close to the river.
I understand the problem. You
don't have to explain it twice.
Colonel, I respectfully request that...
you order your soldiers...
...to enter these people's homes...
...and remove the
bodies by force if necessary.
It's all right.
Hello.
Yes, yes, yes. I understand.
The spirits need access to the
water. I understand that.
I just want to move a few of these
so that they don't live in the water.
He said that they're under
the protection of their warlord.
If he wants to move the bodies,
he will send his own soldiers.
These really aren't the
best times for a Western woman...
...to go exploring a
Chinese town by herself.
Oh, do be quiet.
As if you care whether I'm killed
by Nationalists or boredom.
Besides, I wasn't alone.
I was with my
gallant protector Sung Ching.
By the way...
...you might be happy to know that...
...I am just as useless
to the nuns as I am to you.
I shut off the town's only
water supply today.
What will you do?
I have no idea.
Then I suppose we're both useless.
At last, something in common.
Dr. Fane. We've both been
caught out in the weather.
Not now, sorry.
I beg your pardon?
Counting.
Counting?
We'll camp here tonight.
What makes you think this
warlord fellow will cooperate?
I don't think he will.
So, what do you plan to
say to persuade him?
I don't know.
These men are like animals.
They have no vision.
They only have hunger and strength.
Men like this have held the real
power in China since I was young.
But that time is coming to an end.
There's no place for
them in the new China.
I don't think you like my
being here very much either, do you?
I think China
belongs to Chinese people...
...but the rest of
the world seems to disagree.
Yes, but that's got nothing
to do with me.
I didn't come here with a gun, you know.
I came here with a microscope.
I believe you.
But it would be nice
to do this work together...
...without your country's
guns pointing at our people.
Our plan is to divert the water to
the town from the fields upriver...
...above the burial grounds.
With your permission and
the assistance of your troops...
...the graves will be moved
away from the water.
And Colonel Yu and his men...
...will enforce the
prompt burial of the dead...
...maintaining the
integrity of the water sources...
...and enforcing proper sanitation
over the next few weeks.
It will make a difference between a few
more deaths and possibly thousands.
He says, if we keep the
water source clean,
and enforce proper
sanitation procedures,
then in a few weeks,
the death toll...
...could reduce more than one thousand.
He said no.
He doesn't speak any English, does he?
Tell him that's the most ridiculous
suit that I've ever seen.
I'm sorry.
Do not stop on my account...
...if Dr. Fane is enjoying himself.
No, no, not at all.
It's very nice. I was passing...
No. Stay.
I should go.
I insist.
All right, if you like.
Continue, Mrs. Fane.
But perhaps something
a little more soothing.
Yes, of course.
They brought in a new baby today.
The girls named her Zan Xien.
It means "brand new."
The nuns are going
to call it Katherine...
...which, of course, none
of the girls will be able to say.
Thank goodness for those nuns.
They do so much for so little in return.
I suppose you can look at it that way.
You suppose?
I think it might be a bit
more complicated than that.
They take in desperate
children and give them a chance at life.
What could be so complicated about that?
They also go to young
mothers in their homes.
They ask them to give their
babies to the convent.
They offer them money
to support their families...
...to persuade them to do it.
They're not just here to run
an orphanage, your nuns.
They're turning those children
into little Catholics.
None of us are in China
without a reason.
Still, on the whole...
...I think that what they're doing...
...is a pretty good deed, don't you?
I'm here to study bacteria.
I don't feel the need to have an
opinion about the rest of it.
Well, I do, and I admire them.
I don't think it has to
be so complicated and gloomy.
And I think what you're doing,
for instance, is incredibly noble.
You used to feel
contempt for me. Don't you still?
Walter. I can't believe that
you with all your cleverness...
...should have such little
sense of proportion.
We humans are more complex
than your silly little microbes.
We're unpredictable. We make
mistakes and we disappoint.
Yes, we certainly do.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I'm not the perfect young
woman that you want me to be.
I'm just ordinary.
I never tried to pretend
that I was anything else.
No, you certainly didn't.
I like the theater...
...and dancing and...
...playing tennis. I like games.
I like men who play games.
God forgive me, that's the
way I was brought up.
Well, I play a pretty
fierce hand of bridge.
Oh, well, that's bloody exciting.
And you, you dragged me around all
those interminable galleries in Venice...
...blathering on about
the miracle of the canals...
...and the flashing
of the lagoon system...
...or some such nonsense.
Honestly, I'd have been much happier
playing golf at Sandwich.
I suppose you're right.
It was silly of us to look for qualities
in each other that we never had.
Yes.
Yes, it was.
Walter?
Why didn't you break down that door...
...when you knew I
was in there with Charlie?
You might have at
least tried to thrash him.
He wasn't worth it.
Or maybe I'm just too proud to fight.
I don't know about that.
I've told Mother Superior to
keep her sisters inside the convent.
I put a guard outside the gate.
I'd advise any Westerners
to stay indoors.
All right.
Sister, has Mrs. Fane been
at the convent today?
Yes. But she, she has
left a few minutes ago.
Sung Ching.
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Sung Ching. Where's Mrs.
Fane? Where's Mrs. Fane?!
I don't know what you're saying!
Get away from her.
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
Come on.
We're out of whiskey.
Dr. Fane.
Could I trouble you for a drink?
Hello, darling.
I was stationed at Hankow
during the revolution...
...when they were massacring
all the Manchus.
I was able to help a particular family.
New documents, that sort of thing.
She was the youngest of the daughters.
I didn't pay her too much
attention at first.
Well, more than I should
have, I suppose.
When I left Hankow, she followed me.
I sent her back two,
three times. But she...
...she kept coming back.
I didn't realize you had
so much affection for her.
What makes you think I do?
I can see it in your eyes.
Men are incalculable.
I thought you were
just like everybody else...
...now I feel I don't
know the first thing about you.
I wonder what she sees in you.
Wan Xi.
She says I'm a good man.
As if a woman ever
loved a man for his virtue.
Morning.
Morning.
I should think it best to
stay away from town today.
All right.
I'm going for a walk.
Come on, then.
What on earth are you doing
all the way out here?
Walking off a crippling hangover.
What are you doing?
I've been attempting to purchase
a stalk of bamboo.
But his price is exorbitant.
Or my head is...
...too shattered to negotiate.
So...
- Would you like a ride home?
- On what?
The buffalo?
You see, we're diverting it from
these fields temporarily...
...sending it straight into the center
of town where they can get it easily.
It's over a half-mile. It gave
us a devil of a time in some places.
But it's worth it.
Oh, Mother.
Am I going to die?
Come, come. You mustn't be so silly.
Listen, ma chere...
...is it possible that
you're with child?
- No.
- Oh, yes.
- No.
- Yes.
I mean...
I...
I suppose it's possible.
There is no doubt about it.
Yes. Sister St. Joseph knew at once.
She comes from a large family so she
has experience in these matters.
I can't believe it.
Why can't you believe it?
Having a child is so natural.
Yes.
Think how happy your husband will be.
And what's happened here?
- I'm all right.
- They said you fainted.
I'm fine.
- Let me look at you.
- It's not cholera.
No. I don't think so.
Did you feel nauseous? Or just faint?
Walter, stop.
I'm pregnant.
A baby?
You're quite certain?
Yes.
Well, that's wonderful.
How long do you think
you've been like this?
Two months.
Maybe longer.
Kitty.
Am I the father?
I honestly don't know.
I'm sorry.
Well.
It doesn't matter now.
Does it?
No.
No, it doesn't.
Dr. Fane!
Come with me.
What is this? Where
are they coming from?
The cholera spread south
along the river.
They have no
doctors or facilities there.
If they come in,
they'll contaminate everything.
We've got to keep them outside the town.
Dr. Fane!
Dr. Fane!
Stop! Stop!
Stop!
Please stop here! We can help you here!
Colonel, tell them
not to go into the town!
Tell them we'll help them here!
Mrs. Fane. Gather all the
children in the music room.
Wait here.
Let's go!
That boy. Bring him
here, bring him here.
He has a cut. I'll treat him.
I don't understand.
Why didn't he wake me?
He made an early start.
And you needed the rest.
How far is the refugee camp?
Just outside the town, in the foothills.
Dr. Fane told me he wanted you
to leave, but you would not.
I didn't want to leave you.
Yes. And we
appreciate it, dear child, but...
...I think you did not
want to leave him either.
Well... it's my duty.
Duty is only washing your
hands when they are dirty.
I fell in love when I was 17...
...with God.
A foolish girl with romantic notions...
...about the life of a religious.
But my love was passionate.
Over the years, my feelings
have changed.
He's disappointed me. Ignored me.
We've settled into a relationship
of peaceful indifference.
The old husband and wife who
sit side by side on the sofa,
but rarely speak.
He knows I will never leave Him.
This is my duty.
But when love and duty are one.
...then grace is within you.
Your soldier is
waiting to take you back.
I'd rather stay.
No.
What? What is it?
What?
Mrs. Fane?
Mr. Waddington?
It's your husband.
What? What is it?
He's been taken ill.
Where is he?
Mrs. Fane?
Walter! Oh, no. She can't be here.
It's not safe. Waddington!
I'm afraid I've got no say in the matter
I don't want an audience.
You have to go.
Your baby.
Please, you must go.
Walter, tell me what I should do.
Slow that drip down.
It's running too fast.
Good, good.
Kitty? Kitty.
It's going to get much
worse before it breaks.
Are you prepared for this?
Yes.
What is it?
Can you send for more?
Kitty.
Kitty.
Are you awake?
Are you feeling better?
Forgive me.
Forgive you?
There's nothing to forgive.
Walter.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Mrs. Fane?
Dr. Fane would want
to be buried immediately.
Yes, of course.

It's silly, really.
They'll die in a week.
It's hardly worth the cost.
What do you think?
I think they're quite nice.
Really?
I think you're right.
Come on.
We better hurry. Grandfather's waiting.
Kitty Fane?
As I live and breathe.
Hello, Charlie.
What are you doing in London?
I know it's been a long time.
I should have written.
Who's this fine chap? Hello, young man.
What's your name?
Walter.
Hello, Walter. I'm Charlie Townsend.
How old are you?
Five.
Come on, darling. We should
really press on.
Yes, of course.
Well, it's lovely seeing you again.
Goodbye, Walter.
Goodbye.
Kitty!
I'm going to be in London for
the next 3 weeks. Perhaps we could...
Goodbye, Mr. Townsend.
Goodbye, Mrs. Fane.
Who was that, Mommy?
No one important, darling.
