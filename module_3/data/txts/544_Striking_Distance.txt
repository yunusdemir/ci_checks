Police department, zone one,
Sergeant Roberts.
The search for the Polish Hill Strangler
confines...
in the wake of the discovery
of yet a fourth victim this morning.
The nude body of Arlene Dunn
of Mount Pleasant...
was recovered from the Ohio River...
by Pittsburgh River Rescue.
The police have been alerted
to the crimes by the killer...
who calls after each murder to play
the song "Little Red Riding Hood".
The police brutality trial
of Detective Jimmy Detillo...
came to a conclusion yesterday...
when the jury brought in
a guilty verdict.
Defective Detillo was convicted
for the May 20 beating of Leon Watson.
Watson remains in a coma
in Mercy Hospital.
The key to the conviction
was the surprising testimony...
of homicide defective Thomas Hardy,
Detillo's partner and cousin.
Defective Hardy was present
during WatsonÂ’s arrest...
and testified that his partner
used unwarranted force.
Sentencing is set for June 15.
Come on, son. We're gonna be late
for the policemen's ball.
- You gotta face 'em sooner or later.
- I feel like an asshole.
Well, maybe you are an asshole.
You always were kind of strange.
It's no wonder, growing up
with a role model like you.
- You got that from your mother.
- Just leave Mom out of this.
- Gladly.
- I see you got the boat fixed.
Yeah. Putting it
in the water tomorrow.
So, what's the latest
on Little Red Riding Hood?
Nothing new.
We get close; he slips away.
We make a move; he makes a move.
I'm telling you, Dad, it's a cop.
Maybe an ex-cop. Who knows?
Uncle Nick thinks so too.
You talk to Uncle Nick about Jimmy?
We talked around it.
Look, every cop in Pittsburgh
thinks I'm a rat.
Why should Uncle Nick
be any different?
You're not a rat.
You told the truth.
Nick knows that.
Yeah, well, look what
telling the truth has got me.
I know what you're going through.
You know what my dad used to say?
Loyalty above all else...
except honor.
All units, we're in pursuit of a murder
suspect in a stolen '89 Ford.
Dark blue. License:
Robert Harry X-ray 715.
Oh, damn it!
We just crossed the 31st Street bridge.
Not today!
Suspect is armed and dangerous.
- Repeat: Armed and dangerous.
- Let's go.
Maybe I won't have to go...
to this goddamn
policemen's ball after all.
Take Bigelow.
Jesus!
Why don't you have a date tonight?
You're my date.
I didn't want you to be lonely.
- What happened to that nurse?
- Nothing. It just didn't work out.
You gotta give these things a chance.
You know, that girl
that works for Dutch is awful nice.
Is there some meaning
in all this, Dad?
Grandkids.
- What?
- Yeah.
Hell, I'm not that grown up
myself yet, Dad.
- There they are.
- Go down the alley.
Jesus Christ!
We got fire and two officers down in
the southbound tube. Send an ambulance.
We'll trap him at Second Avenue.
- Come here!
- Captain Hardy?
Get out of the car now,
with your hands up!
Uncle Nick.
Excuse me.
Is this the policemen's ball?
Well, nobody's going to the party
till we get this asshole out of the car.
This is your last chance.
Get out of the car
with your hands up!
Here he comes.
Let's go!
Shit!
Hang on.
He drives like a cop.
Pull up to him.
All right. Come on, fellas. Easy.
Jesus Christ! Take it easy.
Watch the leg.
- Jesus Christ! My leg.
- You're all right.
- Easy, pal.
- Something's wrong with my leg.
- Where's Dad? Where's my dad?
- Tommy, listen.
- Oh, no!
- He's been shot, Tommy.
The killer got away.
Oh, Daddy! Oh, Jesus Christ!
Look who's here.
- Sorry about your father.
- Thanks, Don.
Just couldn't stay away,
could you, Tommy?
You even had to come
to the goddamn sentencing.
Wasn't bad enough you testified
against your partner?
What, did you come down here
to gloat, you prick?
Hey, Uncle Nick.
Hi, Tommy.
How you feeling?
I don't know.
How's the leg?
I don't want to be here, Uncle Nick.
You're a better man
than I am, kid.
- They got your father's killer.
- What?
They're bringing him up
for arraignment right now.
What is this?
His name is Kesser.
What the hell is this?
He couldn't even lift those women.
We have an eyewitness
who saw him dump a body.
What the hell is going on here?
Even you said it was a cop.
I said could be. Now we have
a witness that said it wasn't.
When were you gonna tell me?
Hey, Dad.
Come on. Let's go on in.
I'll be right with you.
Go ahead.
Sit down.
I'll be right in.
Now you listen to me.
I don't want any problems with you.
Do you understand me?
You should be glad we caught him.
Where is he?
A no-show at a police
brutality sentencing?
They're gonna throw the book at him,
your son or not.
Hear ye, hear ye.
The criminal court of the commonwealth
of Pennsylvania is now in session.
Sentencing for the State
versus Detective Jimmy Detillo.
All rise. The honorable
Judge Hellen Kramer presiding.
Mr. Gunther...
- where's your client?
- We don't know, Your Honor.
Jimmy, son, listen to me.
Listen to Daddy, all right?
Come down, and we'll go talk to them.
I promise.
We'll work something out.
Mama went off this bridge.
You remember?
Never found her.
Come on, Jimmy.
You don't have to do this.
Cops don't go to prison, Dad!
I don't go!
Jimmy, we can work this out.
What are you doing here?
You gonna give him a push?
It's my partner.
My flesh and blood!
Come on down, Jimmy.
You're scaring everybody.
Yeah?
Jimmy, don't!
Who's the best cop now, huh?
You, Jimmy.
Always you.
Who's the best cop now?
Always you, Jimmy.
Come on, Jim.
Come on down.
Come on, partner.
Just take my hand.
You motherfucker, Tommy!
You did this!
Come on, Danny.
Let go of him!
Fuck you! You did this,
you motherfucker!
Oh, Bob.
Don't lick me with that fish breath.
I think he's still on the sauce.
He's probably sleeping it off somewhere.
He doesn't know what "quit" means.
He's a fifth generation cop. He'll show.
Oh, yeah?
Who wants to bet, huh?
Twenty bucks says he don't show.
- Hey, take it.
- You're on.
Yeah. Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Tie that up for me, will you?
Hardy!
I've been calling you
for a fucking hour!
You missed roll call.
Penderman's really pissed.
You look like shit.
You fall off the wagon again?
It's five o-fucking-clock, man!
You're a fucking mess!
I'm sick of taking shit for you.
What am I supposed to put in the log?
You wanna get that stern line?
You're a real asshole.
You know that?
All the guys in the division,
and I draw this prick.
Shit.
You bastard!
Get some dry clothes on, Sacco.
I'll catch you on the next run.
Goddamn it!
This is River Rescue.
We have a seven...
River Rescue 9221, this is Base.
We have a 1-11, Shenango Works.
One mile south of Neville Island,
north shore.
Ten-four.
Kim Lee, get Hardy.
River Rescue 9221,
this is Base. Come in.
9221. Go ahead.
Hardy, this is Penderman.
I want you to get back here...
and pick up Sacco.
Malfunction on his radio, sir.
Like when you shut it off.
- Jeff Schultz. Neville Township.
- Tom Hardy.
- Where's your diver?
- He fell off.
Open it up.
Stand back, please.
Shot in the pump.
Small caliber.
- Been in the water 48 hours.
- Less.
Twenty-four hours.
She's been dead 48, though.
Somebody held onto her.
Thank you, Jack fucking Webb.
- Who the fuck is this guy?
- Tom Hardy.
The infamous.
Hi, Sid.
- Hey, Captain.
- Hey, Uncle Nick.
How are you? What do I have to do
to get you to call me, huh?
I call you, Nick.
Your phone's always busy.
- Danny is back.
- You're kidding.
Where was he?
California someplace.
- What'd he say?
- Nothing much. You know Danny.
- So how are they treating you?
- Good.
- I heard Rossmore is retiring.
- Yeah, that's what they say.
You gonna be the next chief?
Not me, kid.
I'm just a Larimer Avenue dago.
I hear they're gonna fry Kesser.
Yeah. That's what
they do with killers.
I'll see you around.
Come on. Let's go.
You know, Sid, when I grow up, I would
love to have a pair of shorts like that.
- How's the wife, Eddie?
- None of your fucking business.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
How would you know?
Hey, you're his partner.
How's his wife?
Let's go, you motherfucker!
Right now!
- Jimmy was my friend, man!
- Eddie's picking on me, Uncle Nick.
- Nobody's gonna forget what you did!
- Shut up, Eddie!
One of these days,
it's gonna be just you and me!
You belong on the river,
you fucking rat!
Workers discovered the victim earlier
this evening in the Ohio River...
near the Shenango Steelworks,
her nude body wrapped in a sheet.
Police have identified her...
as Cheryl Putnam of Monessen.
Police defectives say that Miss Putnam,
a stewardess for Trans East Airlines...
was apparently forcefully abducted
from her own apartment...
before being taken to another location,
where she was murdered.
The brutal crime reminds
many Pittsburgh residents...
of the Polish Hill strangling
two years ago.
Homicide defective Edward Eiler
had this to say.
There's absolutely
no connection here...
other than the victim
of a female Caucasian persuasion.
The Polish Hill victims were strangled.
Cheryl Putnam was shot at close range.
Douglas Kesser
maintains his innocence...
Don't move.
You picked the wrong house
to rob, asshole.
Who are you kidding, Tommy?
You ain't got nothing worth stealing.
It's been a long time.
That's a good way
to get yourself killed.
I wanted to surprise you.
You surprised me.
Give me a drink.
I almost broke my neck out there.
I don't know why you want to live
in this fucking houseboat.
You and your old man
should've burned this thing down.
- Thanks. All right.
- How was California?
Sunny.
- Sunny?
- Yeah.
After two years,
that's all you can tell me?
"Simpsons" are on an hour earlier.
You still mad at me?
Yeah, well, I fucked up.
After that night on the bridge,
I blamed you for Jimmy.
Yeah, I blamed me too.
I looked for you at the funeral.
Ah, I couldn't deal with it.
Another funeral with
an empty coffin like my mom's.
Fucking river took half my family.
Never get 'em back, either.
Oh, wow.
I was wondering what happened
to that picture.
You, me and Jimmy at my dad's cabin.
All gonna be cops like our dads.
Yeah. Brilliant idea.
Look at us now.
I mean, I'm a dropout,
Jimmy's dead...
and you're one of those, uh,
what do you...
Water dogs.
It wasn't your fault
what happened to Jimmy.
No, really.
He had something wrong with him.
No, he did. Like my mom.
And nobody noticed it...
till he beat the shit
out of that suspect.
But I noticed it.
I never did anything about it.
- You did the right thing.
- Bullshit.
You did the right thing.
Fuck 'em!
Fuck 'em.
So you back now?
You here for a while?
Oh, I'm back.
You wanna get something to eat?
No, I gotta meet a girl.
I'll see you later, man.
Welcome home, man.
Hey, Kim Lee.
How you doing, Hardy?
- Who's Christman?
- Jo Christman, new diver.
What's he like?
Not what you expect.
Come on in, Tom.
Tom Hardy, Jo Christman,
your new partner.
She's a police officer.
Also qualified as a diver
and a paramedic.
Hi. It's nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Is this a joke?
Can I ask you what he said?
Thanks.
I hope she floats.
Want to get that stern line, please?
Shit! Put it down!
- Good afternoon.
- Hello.
Give me the bottle.
Let me rephrase that.
Give me the bottle now.
You know this is a "no wake" zone?
No, sir, I didn't.
It is.
Drive a little slower next time.
- Wait. We have to give them a ticket.
- No, we don't.
Yes. They were speeding.
We have to give them a ticket.
Well, you better do it, then.
I'm not sure I can stand the excitement.
Excuse me, sir.
I need your registration.
- Did you see that?
- Yeah.
Take the wheel.
Keep heading upriver.
Switch to channel eight.
Tell Penderman to send backup.
Get outta here.
River Rescue, this is 9221. Over.
Land shark.
Willy?
How many men upstairs?
Let me rephrase that.
- Two, plus the pilot.
- Close your eyes.
Just close 'em.
Do you think we're stupid?
Where's the rest of the money?
Where's the 200 grand?
I say the word, he blows your head off.
You hear me?
Pittsburgh Police.
Now, we have two choices here.
You either put the guns down...
or we all start shooting.
I'll blow his brains...
- Hey, man!
- Hey, come on. Untie us!
Get us outta here!
Hardy, behind you!
Thanks, Dutch.
Hey, you did really good
out there tonight.
Thanks, Hardy.
Really good.
Thanks.
I never had a woman partner before.
Neither have I.
What a night.
You guys are understaffed.
Oh, no, baby.
This is the new "efficiency" system.
- See you tomorrow.
- I switched with Mary Jane.
Todd has Pirate tickets.
See you Wednesday.
Goddamn it.
Hello.
Who is this?
Who is this, goddamn it?
Answer me!
What are you doing here?
The bars closed?
Just visiting some old friends.
You don't have any old friends
down here.
Who would know that better than you,
huh, scumbag?
Yeah, "old friends".
Goddamn it.
Motherfucker. Nick,
he was in the Polish Hill files.
Listen, Tommy.
What are those?
- What?
- That.
- This?
- Yeah.
Nothing. Some papers.
There's an old Italian saying: Don't
scald your tongue on another man's soup.
Yeah, there's an old Irish saying:
Never listen to old Italian sayings.
I knew this was gonna happen.
The minute I seen you at that body,
I knew it was gonna happen.
You won't let go.
You want me to go lay in some bed
for the rest of my life?
My father's in the grave two years.
The guy that killed your father
is wasting away in West Penn.
Bullshit! A cop killed my father,
and you know it.
Kesser never had the brains for this.
Why did you roll over on him?
He was convicted by a jury
of his peers, based on evidence...
- Why won't you answer me?
- I'm telling you!
I loved your father,
and I love you like a son...
but your father is dead
and this case is closed.
If you can't accept that, that's your
problem. But I'm telling you something.
I can take that gun and that badge
away from you right now...
for initiating an illegal investigation.
Is that what you want me to do?
Is it?
Do what you gotta do.
We're out of our patrol zone.
Will you at least tell me
where we're going?
I'm gonna go visit a friend.
I'm gonna break here for dinner.
I'll be back.
Right.
I'll just stay here
and watch the boat.
Get you something?
I'm looking for a guy named Chicanis.
I haven't seen him all night.
Chick! Hey!
Now you're gonna tell me what you know.
Who told you to lie?
- I didn't lie.
- Say the fucking name...
or say good-bye, motherfucker!
- Don't shoot me.
- Hardy!
- Put up your gun.
- Now!
No, Hardy.
Put up your fucking gun.
Goddamn it!
This shit has got to stop.
- If you have a drinking problem, fine.
- I wasn't drinking.
- You're out of control.
- I wasn't drinking.
- You're already on probation.
- How long have you been a cop?
- What?
- How many years have you been a cop?
- One year? Two years?
- Long enough to know the rules.
Maybe you overlooked the one
about partners backing each other up.
From what I hear,
you have no business...
telling me how partners
should treat each other.
I'm supposed to watch you
put a gun to someone's head?
- I wasn't gonna shoot him.
- What were you gonna do?
I'm trying to solve a murder.
What murder?
I hate to break this to you...
but you are not
a homicide detective anymore.
River Rescue 9221, this is Base.
Come in.
- Go from Hardy.
- We got another 1-11.
North shore, River Park,
east of Glenwood Bridge.
Get the bowline.
Yeah, this is Hardy.
9221. We're on our way.
Let's go! Now!
Over here!
Oh, Jesus.
Mrs. Wilson, if the kids have
any bad dreams, trouble sleeping...
call this number,
and we'll send a counselor...
free of charge.
- Right.
- Probably want to get them home.
Kids, come on.
Let's go home now.
Why didn't you ask if they saw anything?
Because they didn't see anything.
The body was dumped upriver last night.
How do you know?
I used to be a homicide detective.
- Round up the usual suspects, Eddie?
- Keep laughing, asshole.
It's a sin what he turned into.
Sorry to interrupt your evening.
- We got a dead nurse.
- Jesus Christ.
You stay here. You understand me?
Don't move.
Absolutely, Dad.
I wouldn't want to get in the way.
What a prick.
Paula Puglisi.
She worked Mercy Hospital.
Same MO as the Putnam woman.
Guess who she used to fuck.
You knew her.
Yeah.
God, Tom, I'm sorry.
That guy you were chasing back there has
something to do with this, doesn't he?
- He was a witness in a murder case.
- The Polish Hill murders?
Yeah.
I was one of the investigating officers.
Five women were strangled.
During a high-speed pursuit
of the suspect, my father was killed.
Chicanis said he saw the killer
dump one of the bodies.
You don't believe him.
This was the case
where you lost your shield.
I lost my shield because I said
a cop killed my father.
Want to give her one more pop
before they take her away?
- How about I give you one more pop?
- Blow it out your ass, you lush.
Go keep the press
out of Uncle Nick's face. That a boy.
That's enough, all right?
I thought you quit smoking.
Gum didn't work.
Who's she?
That's my new partner.
- Not bad.
- You didn't know nothing about that?
No. Why should I?
- Coming back to the force?
- Hell, no.
See what you're missing?
You want a little dinner?
We're going Italian.
- Big surprise.
- I told you to stay up there.
- I was inviting him to dinner.
- Go up there.
- I just wanted...
- Go up there!
He hasn't changed a bit.
That's the problem. Come over here.
I want to talk to you.
So what do you know?
Nothing. Dead body in the water.
We fished it out.
Please don't play games with me.
I'm tired.
- I'm not Homicide anymore.
- I still want to know what you know.
You don't want to hear
what I got to say.
- Try me.
- It's the same guy.
The same guy as what?
Are you talking about Polish Hill?
- The woman had fair hair, good body.
- Your type exactly.
These women were shot, not strangled.
Both had neck bruises.
They were bound, wrist and ankle.
- How do you know?
- Check it out. Ask Eiler.
- Eiler told me you know her.
- A lot of guys did.
- A lot of guys weren't fucking her.
- Goddamn it!
What's the matter with you?
I didn't know better, I'd think
you didn't want to solve this case.
- Go fuck yourself.
- Are you a cop or not?
You come up with some bullshit story
linking all these murders together...
and just because you say it,
I'm supposed to swallow it like tripe.
Let me ask you a question. When was
the last time you seen this girl?
He's putting the bodies in the water
so I'll find them.
- What?
- He wants me to find these girls.
You're crazy, you know that?
You're nuts.
He called me.
He called you?
- That's right.
- The murderer of these girls called you.
- What'd he say?
- He didn't say anything.
He didn't say anything
because you dreamed it.
Now get in your little boat
and get the fuck out of here.
Go catch a fish.
You're an alcoholic, and you need help.
This isn't a joke anymore.
If I were you, I'd see a psychiatrist,
get my head examined.
Maybe you need a drink.
Might ease the pain of being wrong.
Get away from me.
Get out of my sight.
Didn't I tell you to keep those people
out of here? Get them back up the hill.
Am I talking to myself?
Am I in this world all by myself?
Get them people
back up the fucking hill.
Put Grandpa back on.
Yeah, she sounds good.
Yes, me too.
- Hi.
- Hi. You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
This is it. Sixteen months ago.
I didnÂ’t do if.
I didnÂ’t murder anybody.
This witness is lying.
He never laid eyes on me.
One member of the Pittsburgh Police
Department agreed with the accused.
Defective Thomas Hardy...
didn't earn any new friends
with this statement to the press.
No, I don't think Kesser is the killer.
I think he's the patsy.
There was information not admitted
in this case that should have been.
What information?
All of the women were stunned
with police-issue tasers.
Two of the women were called
from police call boxes.
- Shut up.
- They were abducted from areas...
where police response time is slowest!
- Why didnÂ’t you say that?
- Get him out of here!
Because a Pittsburgh cop did if,
and you know if!
An official police report
denied Hardy's accusations.
As for Douglas Kesser...
the controversy
has not changed the outcome.
He has been sentenced to death
in the electric chair.
Airtight case.
Kesser was a drunk, drifter.
No alibi. He confessed to the murder
of a man we believe was his accomplice.
Said it was self-defense.
He denied any connection to Polish Hill.
However...
we recovered evidence from the murdered
women in Kesser's motel room...
along with the gun
that killed Vince Hardy.
Why does Hardy think Kesser was framed?
We got Kesser on an anonymous tip.
Kesser's fingerprints weren't
on the gun. It was a police special.
Serial numbers were filed off.
So Hardy starts barking conspiracy.
He thinks the killer's a cop.
Did anybody else think Kesser
was innocent?
Yeah. Kesser.
Well, Bob...
he's either putting them
in the Allegheny or the Monongahela.
Narrows it down.
This is Hardy here. Go.
It's Jo. I was wondering...
if you're going
to the policeman's ball tonight.
I'm gonna go.
I donÂ’t really know anyone...
so maybe I'll see you there.
Yeah.
- Don't leave me...
- One drink. I'll be right back.
- What the hell is he doing here?
- You believe the nerve of that bum?
He's got a lot of balls coming here.
Captain. He's here.
You look, uh, different.
I'll take that as a compliment.
I didn't think you'd come.
Nobody did.
Hey, Tommy! You made it!
Good to see you, man.
- How are you?
- Come on. The whole family's here.
- I'm waiting for Danny.
- You can bring your friend.
Dad, look who's here.
What'd I tell you?
Let him go, Aunt Mary Ann.
We don't want to keep him waiting.
- Good to see you, son.
- Hi, Uncle Fred.
Ain't you gonna introduce your date?
She's not my date. This is
my new partner, Officer Jo Christman.
Unfortunately, these are the Hardys.
This is my Uncle Fred.
- Nice to meet you.
- My cousin Gary.
- Don't fuck her.
- Yeah.
- You have to come to our house and eat.
- She's right. You're too skinny.
You gotta quit being such a stranger.
Now, since we're all together,
I'd like to propose a toast.
- To Vince Hardy.
- Hear, hear.
Best Captain of Homicide ever.
Let's drink to my mother.
She was a Hardy too.
And how about we drink to Jimmy?
Son, that's enough.
Come on, Daddy. It's fitting
down here by the river, don't you think?
Uncle Vince is dead.
They're dead too.
You're gonna drink to him,
you're gonna drink to them. To Jimmy!
- I said that's enough!
- No, it's not enough, goddamn it!
- Come on.
- Get your fucking hands off me.
Break it up, goddamn it.
You fucking idiot!
Get the fuck out!
Let go! I'm all right!
You don't belong here!
Me and you, Eddie.
Anytime, jack-off.
Come on.
Best day of the year!
Better than Christmas!
Are these policemen all your relatives?
No. They're just criminals
dressed up like policemen.
How'd they all end up on the force?
Just part of some big, nationwide
negative gene pool, I guess.
Don't do that, okay?
What?
That thing where
you're not really talking to me.
It's not the answer.
Well, it'll do
until a real answer comes along.
What the fuck is the matter with you?
Get out.
Get out now!
You want to sit around here
and have a few drinks...
and feel sorry for yourself?
- Just go now, please?
- What is this?
You won't respect yourself
until someone else does first?
Well, I respect you.
It took a lot of courage for you to walk
in there and face the department...
when you know they're waiting
to see you fall on your ass.
- You're giving them what they want.
- No.
They want me silent.
Stupid is almost as good.
Go now, please.
Just go home.
No, I don't want to.
What are you doing?
What made you decide
to become a cop?
I mean...
why would you want to put up with all
the horseshit you gotta go through...
being a woman and all?
When I was in college,
my roommate was raped.
The campus police were only interested
in keeping it quiet...
so I started poking around.
I knew the guy was white.
He was very tall.
So I started checking out
the basketball courts near the campus...
and I took pictures
of all the white players.
She identified him
from one of the photographs.
- You caught the guy?
- Yeah.
This is the Pittsburgh
Police Department.
Pull the car over now
and stop the engine.
Stop the car now,
or I will shoot.
Take the wheel.
All units, this is River Rescue 9221,
in pursuit of a murder suspect...
heading west
on the railroad service road.
Mile 16 of the Monongahela.
Suspect is driving...
a blue sedan, is armed and dangerous.
Send backup.
All units, respond.
Shit.
Hold it steady.
What are we looking at here?
Oh, my God!
It's definitely a rug.
Way to go, Hardy, you asshole.
I told you it was a fucking rug.
Congratulations.
I'm proud of you.
We're all very proud of you.
You chased away a litterbug,
blew up his car and recovered a carpet.
- It looked like a body.
- You might consider a career change.
Let's just say,
for the sake of argument...
that it was the killer,
and it was a cop.
It would be very easy for him to figure
out our patrol patterns, right?
Then he'd just be waiting
for us to come along.
Exactly.
He dumps the rug
to make us look like morons.
- It worked.
- Yeah.
- Hardy?
- Yes?
There's something I should tell you.
Are you really a man?
Good.
But I was married to one.
Cop?
Worse. A lawyer.
That is worse.
We have a daughter. She's four.
- What's her name?
- Sarah.
Nice name.
Thanks.
Is that it?
We shouldn't be doing this.
We're partners.
Yeah. We should be taken out and shot.
We should shoot each other.
Too much paperwork.
I'm serious.
Maybe you should consider
a career change.
What's wrong?
What's the matter?
- There was another murder?
- Yeah.
Her name was Constance Cabrizzi.
Used to call her Connie.
You knew her too?
I took her to the prom.
Amazing coincidence, huh,
me knowing all these girls?
You knew about the nurse.
Now you know about Cheryl.
And now Connie.
- You've got to tell someone.
- Who would I tell?
How would I know I could trust them?
- I don't know how high up this goes.
- What do you mean?
Imagine if I told the wrong person.
- You didn't do this.
- Why?
Because it's such an obvious frame?
Now I know why you've been so obsessed
with this and with Polish Hill.
There is no "this" and "Polish Hill"
like they were two separate things.
It's the same killer.
He killed those girls in '91.
He killed my father, and now
he's killing women out of my life...
and putting them in the river
so I'll find them.
You're scaring me.
It's scaring me too.
All the women in my life
keep turning up dead.
You are not listening to me.
I am telling you...
that there is absolutely no connection
between Polish Hill and these new girls.
If you print one hint of that
in your newspaper...
I am knocking you off this beat.
You'll get shit from now on.
Good-bye.
Goddamn it.
The tip checked out. Hardy went
to high school with the Cabrizzi dame.
That's two out of three.
If we dig, I bet we can tie him
to Cheryl Putnam.
- You want me to bring him in?
- No.
Couldn't hold him
with what we've got anyway.
We can put him under review.
I'm calling Internal Affairs.
You can't do an IA unless he's been
under close surveillance for two weeks.
He's been under surveillance
for three weeks.
- Close surveillance?
- Doesn't get any closer.
This is Detillo.
Thank you, Officer Sacco.
You may step down.
I'd like to call
Detective Emily Harper.
That's Jo.
Raise your right hand, please.
Do you swear to tell the truth...
the whole truth and nothing but
the truth, so help you God?
- I do.
- Please state your name for the panel.
Detective Emily Harper.
You are a member...
of the Internal Affairs Division of
the Pennsylvania State Police, correct?
Yes.
Tell the panel, please...
about your last assignment.
The assignment had two parts:
To rate Officer Hardy's competence as
a member of the River Rescue division...
and to monitor his unusual interest
in the Three Rivers murder cases.
You state in your report that
Officer Hardy consistently ignored...
his River Rescue duties to pursue
an illegal investigation...
into the Three Rivers murder case.
That's correct.
To what do you attribute
Officer Hardy's...
unusual interest in this case?
He believes that the murders
were committed...
by the same man responsible for
the Polish Hill murders two years ago.
A case he worked on.
- That's right.
- Mr. Chicanis...
a prosecution witness in that case...
reported that Officer Hardy assaulted
and threatened him at gunpoint...
and that you were forced to protect him
by threatening Officer Hardy...
with your own weapon.
No, that's incorrect.
I drew my weapon as backup.
Backup?
That's what I call it.
Officer Hardy was not...
out of control and dangerous?
At no time.
- At no time during that...
- At no time whatsoever.
Officer Hardy is courageous
and resourceful.
His values are the finest.
I just wish...
we had more officers of his quality.
- Excuse me.
- That's my evaluation.
I was under the impression
that's what you brought me up here for.
Thank you very much, Detective.
You may step down.
Ten-minute recess.
I'm sorry.
Why did you change your testimony?
Why do you think?
You cheat good.
Emily, it's your father.
Sorry we missed you.
Sarah just wanted to say hello.
She's enjoying her visit.
Mom and I will see you Sunday.
Bye.
Hi, Jo.
I mean Emily.
Never get used to that name.
I wanted to tell you
it took a lot of courage...
to do what you did today
at the hearing.
Maybe we can talk.
Call me.
Yes, I know you're hungry.
Christ, you're always hungry.
Go catch a rat.
Let's see what our friends
at Coast Guard have for us.
Let's see.
Cheryl is one.
Then Connie. That's 15.
And...
Nothing up there but cabins.
Jesus Christ.
Bob, will you get the...
This is Hardy here. Go.
Kim Lee! No!
God! It stops now!
Put your hands in the air, right now!
Where is she?
- What are you talking?
- Where's the girl?
- Where's who? Put that fucking gun down!
- Raise your hands!
- I got your fucking note!
- What note?
Jesus Christ.
The police brutality trial
of Leon Watson ended today...
with a guilty verdict
for Detective James Detillo.
Detillo was convicted on three counts
of assault and reckless endangerment.
The key to Detillo's conviction
was the testimony...
of Detillo's partner, his cousin...
Detective Thomas Hardy,
a witness to Watson's arrest.
Surprised?
Hello, Jimmy.
I got ya.
I got you fucking good,
didn't I?
Yeah.
Yes!
What a world.
It's really hard to believe,
isn't it?
I jump off a bridge.
I don't die. Go figure.
And you.
Being so smart.
That must be a real comfort to you...
especially at a time like this, huh?
- Jimmy.
- Shut up.
You shut your fucking mouth!
I loved you! You're my brother,
and you betrayed me!
You betrayed me
for this worthless piece of shit.
You knew I was the best cop!
- Say it!
- Don't! Stop it, please!
- Who's the best cop?
- Jimmy was the best cop!
- What are you doing?
- Poor Danny. It's all right.
Let's have a drink, huh?
Come on. Me and you,
just like the old days.
Remember how we used to drink
to old times?
Look at me
when I fucking talk to you!
What's the matter?
You're a drunk, aren't you?
Come on! Drink!
Are you too proud
to drink with a dead man?
Maybe I should drink
with your little dove.
Would you like that?
- Leave her alone.
- Shut the fuck up!
So I'm killing all these girls.
He's riding next to me wondering,
"Who's doing it?"
We're investigating the crimes together,
and I'm sitting...
right next to my partner.
You have been a very bad boy.
You've been fucking
your brand-new partner, huh?
Did you get fucked, honey?
Don't feel too special...
because Tommy's made a career
out of fucking his partners.
- Let this girl go.
- Shut the fuck up!
I'll kill you right now.
You see this, honey?
- Bye-bye, Tommy.
- Don't kill me!
I like this game!
You know why? Everybody dies,
and they all die with Tommy's gun.
Now we got us a game.
- Say good-bye to her.
- Don't do it! Please!
Now we got us a game.
Say good-bye to her.
Put the gun down, son, all right?
Please?
Listen to Daddy.
- Put the gun down.
- What fun would that be, Dad?
It's over, son.
Put the gun down.
- Please.
- It's just starting.
Please!
I think Tommy
has some questions for you.
Tommy? Comments?
Come on.
- Should I help him along?
- Don't, please.
You know your dad...
God bless his Irish soul...
he was...
How should I put it, Captain?
- Please don't.
- He was sort of killed.
Captain, you want to tell Tommy
who killed his dad?
Tell Tommy.
Tell him!
Don't move.
I'll fucking kill you.
Son of a bitch.
Get up.
You son of a bitch.
Get up!
Stop.
I'll kill you.
I'm your son.
Let me go.
- Freeze!
- No, Vince...
Stop or I'll shoot!
I'm sorry.
I never meant
for any of this to happen.
He was my son.
But it's over now...
because we're going in
together.
What are you gonna do, Dad?
You gonna shoot me?
Come on.
Shoot me.
Couldn't do it before.
You don't have it in you.
Shoot your own son?
There goes that gold watch.
Hail Mary, full of grace...
Who's the best cop?
A bulletproof vest!
Who's the best cop now?
You motherfucker! Come here!
Come on, Jimmy! Me and you!
Run, you son of a bitch.
I just want to talk to you.
Come on.
Why are you making me chase you?
Come on.
Are you mad at me?
Just shot my dad.
Call me.
No, I'll call you.
Fan out.
Coffey! Get these handcuffs off me!
- What the hell you doing handcuffed?
- Where's Detillo? What's going on?
Get these off!
Get up there. He's been shot. Get off!
I'm not getting off.
You son of a bitch!
Fuck!
Come on!
Watch your head!
Try to fuck me.
Get away!
Stop it!
You could never beat me!
- You like to jump off bridges?
- No. Of course...
Who's the best cop now?
You gonna be all right, sir?
- Can somebody take these off me?
- I need some handcuff keys.
I was a real shithead.
Guess you want to take a shot at me.
Wouldn't do any good.
On the other hand...
Hardy!
Hardy.
You okay?
Grandkids, Dad.
