Back in the '70s,
every cop wanted out of the city.
But the only cops allowed to live
outside New York were transit cops.
Because the Transit Authority
was also run by Jersey and Connecticut.
So these guys I knew
at the 37...
they started pulling overtime
at subway stations,
and got the city to declare them
"auxiliary transit cops."
They bought some land in Jersey. Got
some cheap loans from people they knew.
They made themselves a place
where the shit couldn't touch 'em.
That's what they thought anyway.
Every precinct
has its "cop bar",
a private club, all blue,
no civilians.
For the 37,
it was the 4 Aces...
just across the river.
They hired this local hero
to be their sheriff.
A wanna-be who couldn't get on
the force on account of his bad ear.
This Armenian guy,
he's from the other side over there.
He tells her that she's dead. Right?
She's gonna be dead by morning.
- So he drops this box off
at her place, right?
- They call you guys.
- They call Bomb Squad.
- Right. We go in there.
We x-ray it on scene.
- And, uh, we can't see
anything in there.
- Right.
So I cut a little hole in it.
I can see there's something in there.
I, uh, I see that there's, uh,
some white fuzz.
There's something pink.
I can't figure out what it is.
- Suddenly I realize
I am looking at a tongue.
- Ah, shit!
A big, fat tongue
sticking out at me. Yes.
The guy put a goat's head in there.
This at the end
of the twentieth century.
H.G. Wells, he'd turn over in
his grave to think at the start
of a new millennium...
- some Iranian guy...
- Armenian. Armenian guy.
Some Armenian would be
deliverin' a goat's head to the
door of the woman that he loved.
- Backward culture over there.
- Let me tell you.
We're all backwards, Berta.
- Our machines are all modern
and shit, but our minds?
- Gary.
Our minds are primitive.
Our minds are primitive, Berta.
- Hey.
- I gotta go home, baby.
All right, wait. I'm just waitin'
on the call, okay? Come here.
- I gotta pick up the car.
This is not...
- Monica, sit down.
You have no authority.
You have no authority.
Yeah, yeah. Fine.
It's quiet tonight,
huh, Freddy?
It's quiet.
Everyone's at that
bachelor party across the river.
Hey, Figgsy,
you got any quarters?
Hey, hey, how you doin'?
Sorry, Freddy. Hey.
I was wondering if
you'd be able to, uh, come by.
Yeah. 4 Aces.
Where else?
Shit!
Damn it.
Two kinds of people
in this world.
Pinball people
and video game people.
You, Freddy,
you're pinball people.
Always got somethin'
to say, Figgsy.
Come on. Freddy,
Freddy, Freddy.
Freddy! Freddy!
Come on.
Come on. Come on.
Come on.
It's bedtime, Sheriff.
You all right to drive?
- You sure?
- Positive.
- Take it easy, Freddy.
- Take it easy.
It was not Lady Luck that
Jim Maloney found in Atlantic City.
It was the cops.
The 30-year-old native
of the Caribbean island of Antigua...
was captured in a casino just days
after an inspiring rap artist...
was fatally beaten
in a Queen's convenience store.
Sources have filled in some
of the blanks for 1010 WINS saying...
Shit!
Oh! All right.
Take it easy, take it easy.
I apologize.
Magilla-gorilla,
you fucking ape.
- Mikey, I'm out.
I'm gettin' outta here.
- Where're you goin'?
- I love her.
- Yeah! Hell of a party!
- Roger.
- Okay, Superboy.
You're my man, Superboy.
- My man, Roger.
- Keep it up.
You guys take it easy. Davey, can you
disclose your fist legally please?
I don't like
bachelor parties.
See you back
in Jersey.
Shit!
Goddamn it!
Ah, fuck!
Shit!
You have to fuck out
all the stuff here. Ah, Jesus!
Frankie?
Jesus Christ! What are you
guys doin'? You're giving me
a heart attack over here.
Hey, Superboy,
what'd ya say, kid?
- You all right, Jackie?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
Yeah? All right,
I'll see you guys tomorrow, man.
You're like creepers back here.
Thanks, kid.
Be careful driving, huh?
Giants leading 10 to 6
as they move to the bottom
of the seventh inning...
in a game characterized
by big rallies.
The Giants scored seven times
in the first inning off...
- Well, fuck!
- The Yankees lost to the Angels today.
Hey!
Pull over. N.Y.P.D.
Pull over!
Hey, you hear me?
Pull over!
No!
Fuck! Shit!
Fuck, cocksucker!
Freddy?
Traffic incident?
Bullshit!
Hey, what's up, man?
These guys were shot like six times.
Hey, just shut up,
do your fucking job!
- Fucking nurse.
- What've you got?
I got four vials of crack here
and a pipe. That's it.
Russell, what you're thinking,
swallow it.
The guy saved five babies
out in Redhook, all right?
That's right. Black babies,
mashed potatoes don't mean gravy.
- I'm on the bridge.
- Is Babitch there?
- Yeah. I see him.
- Take care of it.
Uncle Ray? Uncle Ray, I saw a gun.
I saw the gun. He took a shot at me.
Tell 'em. They took a shot at me.
Stay here with us.
Tunney didn't even get
the grand jury for shit like this.
Fuck the G.J. You're Superboy, huh?
You saved, what?
Six black babies?
Come on, kid, the shit plays!
- Three babies.
- Hey, one at a time, please.
I got P.A. On another channel,
the mayor's office, assistant D.A.
Press up the yin-yang.
The only reason they're not here now...
is we got gridlock from
across Bronx to the Palisades.
There's no gun.
You didn't see it, Jack?
You can't find it?
- Flaky.
- Listen, I heard a shot.
I heard a shot, Ray.
- I heard a shot. I saw a gun.
- In my trunk, in the grand union bag.
- I heard a shot, Leo.
- The kid had a steering wheel
lock in his hand.
Your tyre blew.
You fucked up.
And you wasted a pair of shit-bags...
who aren't worth the hair
in the crack of your ass.
So you cool it
with the patty-cake morality.
Because without me, kid,
those stiffs'll put you in a room...
- where you will fuck your uncle
and everything he's built.
- Hey, Leo.
The black van's gonna be here
in a minute and I haven't done shit!
- What I'm doing is highly...
- Sympathetic.
- Yeah, damn right.
- It is.
- Ray, we don't have to do this.
- Calm down.
Fuck, Ray!
Ooh, baby!
Hey, we got it.
- Look at that, huh? We got it!
- Yo, yo, yo, yo.
- What the fuck are you doin', man?
- I found their piece.
- Found their piece?
- Ah, Jesus!
- That wasn't in there.
- What do you mean it wasn't in?
It was underneath the floor mat.
Bullshit, man. You can't do that!
Shut the fuck up!
Do what? It was underneath
the fucking floor mat.
What the fuck are you doing?
Fuck you!
I told you not to do it
like this, Ray.
- We're just doin' our job,
so let's just calm down.
- I told you!
Take it easy. Hey!
You boys should take care
of your own business here.
Take my fucking shield
away from me.
- Hey, put it down!
- What? You gonna shoot me?
- Put it down, Chico!
- Chico this, motherfucker!
- Frankie, help me start it up.
- What the fuck you gonna do?
Kiss my ass!
Fuck!
Hey, Jack, Jack, Jack.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Leo!
Leo! Jesus!
He jumped!
Oh, my God!
He jumped!
- He jumped!
- Murray?
Somebody shine a light
down there.
He just hit the water
and... he went down.
- Davis? Where's Davis?
- Oh!
- I want aviation, harbour.
I want some illumination now!
- Stupid, fucking kid!
- Oh, my God!
- We got a man over the fucking G.W.!
How long is the car
gonna take?
Lenny won't know
till the parts guy gets in.
You should take
number two.
What did you tell Lenny
about the accident?
- Chasin' a speeder.
- What?
Sheriff was chasin'
a speeder.
Our top story on 1010 WINS:
A fatal shootout on the G.W.B.
And a cop's suicide.
Highway Patrol continues searching the
Hudson River for the body of Officer...
Murray "Superboy" Babitch.
- Babitch leaped off the George
Washington bridge last night,
- Hey, hey, put it out.
- An apparent suicide, after
engaging in a high-speed chase.
- Fuck you, arsehole.
There's no way
that guy jumped, man.
- There's no fucking way!
- Controversy swirls around events
on the bridge.
Officer, how can you testify...
that Superboy jumped off that bridge
when you didn't see him jump?
I mean, I'm looking
at your statement right here...
that you filled out
at 0200 hours.
Wait a minute. I'm gonna object
because we went through this.
Now, he's been up all night.
How many times are you gonna ask
the same question?
Let me ask you another
question, brother.
Have you ever been
to Garrison, New Jersey?
- What kind of question
is that, Lieutenant?
- Counsellor.
Have you ever been
to Garrison, New Jersey?
- You think those white boys
on that bridge...
- Come on, Lieutenant.
- Please. I object to this!
- What do you think this is, Mod Squad?
I'm offended by this.
All right, all right!
All right, listen.
He doesn't tell us what we want
to know, he's gonna lose his job.
That's about as simple
as I can make it. He's gonna lose
his fuckin' job. All right?
Do you want that?
What do you take us for?
A bunch of fuckin' morons, huh?
- What is the matter with you?
- With all due respect, I think...
- You be quiet, you be quiet!
Shut up!
- I believe...
If you don't mind my French,
all right? You be quiet.
He's off the force if he
does not start answering questions.
You want to save your ass?
Start giving us answers.
And I'll tell you something.
We know anyway.
So do yourself a favour,
and stop fuckin' around.
It's Grotto.
- Murray, get down.
- It's Freddy's new girl.
Cover yourself.
- Hi. Could you turn
your engine off for me?
- I got the air on.
- You on the job?
- No.
We're comin' from Forest Hills.
I'm John McEnroe. That's Jimmy Connors.
Is your licence in there?
Can you pull it out for me, please?
- This is a school zone.
- Christ!
Listen, Miss Betts.
You're new, right?
Yes, I'm new here,
but I'm not new on the job.
- I was...
- Freddy!
- A municipal deputy in Elmira.
- Freddy!
You see, Officer, in Garrison...
when the car you're gonna tag
has got a P.D.A. sticker...
I'd advise you to think to yourself,
"Hey, that's one of the good guys.
I think I'll go catch me
a bad guy."
If we didn't pull over P.D., there
wouldn't be any violations in this town.
The problem in this town
ain't the people that live here.
It's the element that visits.
Is this a new car, Ray?
It's nice. We didn't recognize it.
Come on, Freddy, I wanna go home.
Tell this cupcake to heel.
- Okay, that's not necessary.
- Cindy.
- Well, listen, take care, guys.
See you later.
- Hey!
- What happened to you, Freddy?
- Fender benders.
She's kinda cute.
Dispatch. Hi!
Can I call you back?
Bye.
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. I got it.
Dispatch.
No, no. That's the next town over.
You called Garrison.
Right. The town
with all the police.
What are you gonna do with Superboy?
You gotta stash him someplace.
We lie low.
Hey, Moe!
Hey, Ray.
- Sorry to hear about your nephew.
- Yeah, he was a good kid.
We were up all night
with it.
I know you need
to talk to me.
I'll come in next week
sometime. How's that?
- Jackie here's comin' in
early for you. Tomorrow.
- Hi, Jackie. Moe Tilden.
Yeah, hey.
- Moe Tilden.
- Yeah. Frankie Lagonda.
- What house?
- Out of the 37.
- You been there long?
- Maybe too long, huh?
- Too long. Right.
- Moe, here, was my classmate
at the academy.
Back in the day...
before he fell in love with this
redhead at I.A. And transferred.
Is that how it went, Ray?
So what brings you to our fair city?
Checkin' up on us?
I heard there was
a way of life out here.
Thought I'd check it out
for myself.
What are we, uh,
like the Amish now?
See you around.
You fuckin' rat.
Ah, shit!
I thought you gave me a ticket.
You the sheriff?
- I thought you gave me a ticket.
- One second.
Hey, hey, Gordon, that's it.
Knock it off. Let him go.
- Arsehole!
- Just let him go.
Everyone go down to the park.
Go on. Go on
before I kick your ass.
Get on!
Sorry.
How long
you been a sheriff?
- Ten years.
- That's great.
I see there's a lot
of city cops here.
- Oh, yeah. A lot of cops.
- Great gig.
I like it.
Well, I don't wanna waste your time.
Let me give you my card.
It's a special unit
in the city.
If you ever wanna talk about anything,
it's all confidential.
Okay.
Nice to meet ya.
Ray, that fuck Tilden
shows up here with that grin.
Freddy's new girl
pulls us over.
I mean, someone's talkin'.
I say it's Figgis.
I mean,
we got some loose ends.
I'm sorry. Oh.
- Jesus, I'm sorry.
- Oh, it's okay. I heard voices.
I was gonna have the base
call you back anyway.
Freddy! Look what you found.
She's gonna be so happy. Her daddy
won it for her at the fair last year.
- And I left it on top of the car.
- I know. I saw from my window.
It's awful
about Ray's nephew.
Mmm.
What happened
to your nose?
Ah, little accident.
I was chasing a speeder.
Mommy, I need some black!
Oh, shh.
Look what the sheriff found. Remember
how you were crying for that today?
Freddy, do you want
some coffee?
Um, no, I'm fine.
Thanks, Liz.
- I got a little bit on me.
- Yeah, you got a
little bit on you, didn't you?
Come here. Okay.
All right. You know what?
I have to get something
to clean this off of you.
Okay. We got it off
both hands.
Isn't that nice?
I'm gonna go get a washcloth. Okay?
All right. You just draw a rainbow.
Enough with the sparkles.
I'll be right back.
All right?
Well.
I was gonna call you.
Not you.
One of your guys.
Why? What's up?
Someone's been dumping garbage,
garbage bags.
Is that them?
Just one of them.
The rest are mine.
I don't tell Joey, 'cause then he
thinks he's got to deal with it.
Not that he doesn't think much
of the local... about you guys.
I'll take care of it.
It's okay.
He's got the city
to worry about, right?
Anyway...
What's the point
with the black garbage bag?
It's just I found
your phone bill in a black
garbage bag down the street.
So, what if I said I didn't know
where it came from?
I'd take your word
for it, Rose.
- Is Ray home?
- No. He's taking care
of our little visitor.
- My garbage gets picked up
every Tuesday.
- All right.
Well, thanks for your time,
Rose.
You tell Joey that he should
come and talk to me...
if he thinks
I got no right.
Rose, I wanna believe you
when you tell me something.
Did you dump these bags or not?
Freddy, this isn't
a law problem. Okay?
You tell Joey Randone
if he does not like my garbage,
well, then, he should stop
soiling my sheets.
You gonna tell Ray
about this?
- Hey, Ray.
- What's up, Freddy?
- Decided to give me that ticket?
- No.
- Somebody's been dumping garbage.
- Oh... a felony!
- What's wrong, Officer?
- Could I see your licence
and registration, please?
- I was just asking...
- We just came to get
a view of the city.
- I don't believe this.
- It'll be all right.
They're just a couple over.
I'm checking docs.
- I'll sit.
- I roger that.
- This ass motherfucking pig.
- We came here to watch the view!
- And you pull this?
- Speeding? My ass! Goddamn.
Do you know the meaning
of the word harassment?
That's what this is, you know.
- It was Rose, wasn't it?
- Liz,
if you want me to,
I'll talk to 'im.
Ah, why?
You didn't marry him.
No.
But I'm your friend.
Freddy, look, I gotta go.
And let me be clear.
It was the system that drove Murray
"Superboy" Babitch off that bridge.
Murray Babitch was a hero cop.
He deserved a fair hearing, but he knew
this would not happen, not in this city.
Activist Cyril Johns
met the parents of the slain teens,
calling for a human blockade
on the bridge tomorrow.
A drunk cop jumps off a bridge.
That does not erase the murder
of two black children.
Attending the Yankee game,
Mayor Farelli responded to reports...
- of cops attempting to plant
evidence on the bridge.
- Shh. Shh.
We are looking into it. There may have
been some irregularity on the bridge.
- But as I say...
- Your mother's an irregularity.
No more comments, please.
I'm here to enjoy the ball game
with my wife. Thank you.
Oh, that's your boss.
Are you kidding?
- You'll never get
another raise in your life.
- Who's gonna tell?
Diagonal rule.
Diagonal rule. Red light, don't fight.
You make a right.
It's more important
than the golden rule.
- If Superboy knew that,
he'd still be alive, Freddy.
- Yo! Yo, yo.
Freddy, I heard you saved
Ollie the turtle today.
- What happened to your nose?
- Ah, nothing.
I just had a little accident.
Listen, Joey, there's something
we should probably talk about
if you've got some time.
- What?
- Something we should...
If you have a few minutes.
Pretty boy Joey
bettin' against the Bulls.
What is that? What, are you
some kind of high roller?
- Fuck you, Figgs. I had 12 points.
- Against the 5-time NBA champs?
What kind of bet is that?
You know, you night guys,
you watch way too much Oprah when
you should be catching your "Z's."
Uh-huh, Figgs, well at least
I'm not the one sniffin' my money away.
That was your inner child
making that wager, Joey.
Little boy Joey with the little
Met poster taped above his bed.
Tell you what, Figgs,
why don't you do me a favour.
Come on over here, unzip me, pull out
my inner child and take a bite, baby.
Bite it hard
and bite it thick.
- Fuck you!
- No, fuck you!
Don't fuck like that, P.D.
How's that make you feel, Freddy?
I don't care.
Yeah?
You like eatin' doughnuts?
Look, Freddy.
I say it's okay to be jealous.
You saved this girl's life,
right?
From it, from risking yourself
from saving her sorry ass,
you go deaf as a result.
- In one ear.
- In one ear.
Then you have to watch as this girl
you saved, this beauty queen,
marries this cocksucker!
And you, with your ear, you can't
even get a desk on the force.
You're fucked.
Be jealous, Freddy!
Let it out.
I would.
Purge! Cleanse yourself.
Fucking cleansing.
Del, Del, let me have
another beer.
I gotta go, Freddy.
School's in session.
See you later.
He bets against the Bulls.
No one wants to get
involved in your personal life, Gary.
But just because you're
undercover now, that don't mean
people aren't watchin' you.
Wh-What's going on here?
This is fucking bullshit.
This is bullshit.
What is this, omerta? Huh?
Listen, if I.A.'s gonna
fucking hang me by the balls,
it ain't gonna be over
some fucking missing evidence.
Figgsy, you've been a cop
12 years. Six grams missing.
It's not a white socks
violation, babe.
Come on! You bought that big
ol' house. Maybe you're tryin'
to get out from under.
- Hey! Jack.
- What the fuck's up your ass?
You're telling me you're gettin'
by without gravy, any of you?
Listen to me.
I was putting out Ray's fires
when you were still suckin'...
on your mama's titties, so just
back the fuck off, all right?
So you want to toss me?
What? You can't...
- Sit down, Gary.
- No! Tell me what's going on!
- This is bullshit!
- Even better, why don't you
get the fuck out?
Fuck you, you fucking child.
Just back the fuck off.
At least I'm not shackin'
with no reekin' whore.
You're supposed to fuck 'em, Gary,
not open up a methadone clinic.
- Figgis, get the hell off of me!
- Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, Figgis, come on.
That's too much now.
Hey, hey, hey!
- Gary.
- Fuck you.
You got a problem with me
helpin' a girl in trouble, huh?
- Figgsy.
- You have a problem with that?
- Huh?
- No, you're a fuckin' humanitarian!
- Come here, come here. You think
you're so fuckin' bad, huh?
- Oh, God!
Come on. Come here.
You see this?
Look at Tunney.
You see him?
- That was my fuckin' partner.
That was a cop!
- Enough!
Let go of him, Figgsy.
Go home.
You all right, Jack?
Don't shut me out, Ray!
You found us a sweet
little town. You got us the
low interest, and I'm grateful.
But don't forget who it was that you
came to two years ago to cover your ass.
Get him outta here, Freddy.
- Come on.
- It's not my fault
that you can't look at him!
You sit in this chair...
with your back to 'im.
You want it to go away,
but I'm still here.
In for a penny, in for a pound.
Don't shut me out, Ray.
I'll take care of it,
Ray.
It's bullshit. I'm gettin'
the fuck outta this town!
- Open the door.
- You wanna play games?
I don't play games.
I want the door op...
I want... I want...
Open it now!
- Shut up!
- Why don't you go up the street
and get into bed with Rosie?
- Please open the goddamn door now!
- Idiot!
Open it... now!
Freddy, go home. Everything is just
hunky-dory. Please go.
- Mind if we check up on Liz?
- Yes, I do. I mind.
I said I mind, Freddy.
- Joey, I've had it, okay?
- I'll get the kit.
Liz, it's Freddy.
Does Ray know?
Freddy, does Ray know?
- Hi, Freddy.
- Are you okay?
Your Uncle Freddy is here
to rescue you again.
Liz, maybe you and the baby need
a place to stay. Let him cool off.
I could take you over to the Ramada.
Do you want me to do that?
He didn't do anything.
I... hit him with a bottle.
When I lost you, honey
Sometimes I think
I lost my guts too
Yeah, I wish that
I could send you word
Send me something
I'm afraid
Freddy?
Freddy!
His girlfriend
was in the basement.
- So where is Figgs?
- I called him at the precinct.
He's on his way.
Oh.
We got no pressure. We can steal
water from that tower over there.
Monica, can you hear me?
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Monica!
Baby, what were
you doin' in there?
Hey! I came back
to see you.
I need...
I needed some...
Wanted...
to see you,
but you weren't there.
I was workin'.
I was workin'.
Monica!
No, baby.
Oh, my God.
- The fucker's gettin' payback.
- Who is?
Ray. Who do you think?
Lenny said it wasn't suspicious.
He said it was electrical.
Figgsy?
Look at me, Figgsy.
Did you call in?
I'm not on till Tuesday.
I'll call in.
Buy you a couple weeks.
In a cemetery
practically reserved for cops,
we come across the tombstone
of Officer Glenn Tunney.
You may recall his case.
He was murdered in his jail cell
awaiting the grand jury.
Two years later,
deja vu.
Another hero cop, Murray Babitch
is his name, dubbed Superboy,
unwilling to trust the system
that destroyed his friend,
jumped from
the George Washington Bridge.
- Freddy.
- How ya doin'?
Freddy.
Maybe we should
go up there.
Freddy. Freddy?
I want you to meet the head of
the Patrolman's Defence Association.
Great.
Vincent.
Vincent Lassaro, I'd like you
to meet Sheriff Freddy Heflin.
- You did a good job here.
You did a great job. Real nice.
- Thank you.
- Freddy's a hell of a guy.
- Good, great.
He was trying to get on the force,
but he had this problem with his ear.
- You're not a lip reader, are ya?
- No, no.
It's just this one ear when
I was a kid I had this accident.
You should call me. I mean, when
Ray Donlan puts his thumb in the air...
It's not the force, but I got
my own people. Call me.
Is he serious?
Freddy, my boy,
that is how things happen.
See you later.
"Eternal God, our Father,
the Lord of our life and death,
we acknowledge Thee in all our ways
and in all events which befall us."
What's in the coffin?
His uniform.
"Then in Thy great mercy, grant us
a safe lodging and a holy rest.
And peace at last
through Jesus Christ, our Lord."
Amen.
Unto God's gracious mercy
and protection, we commit you.
The Lord bless you
and keep you.
The Lord make His face to shine
upon you, and be gracious unto you.
The Lord lift up His countenance
upon you and give you peace...
both now and forevermore.
Amen.
Hi, Sheriff.
How you doin'?
How you doin'?
This is Detective Carson.
- How's it goin'?
- Come on in. It's your office.
That there is Manny Cardoza
and his brother. They're drug runners.
I didn't know they allowed
classical music in Jersey.
Who's this?
Toy Torillo.
You heard of him?
Oh, yes.
I don't know how you do it,
Sheriff.
Keeping all these Hessians
in line.
All blue. Everybody packing.
All together.
One door
down from the next.
The wives borrowing
the sugar.
It's like you're the sheriff
of Copland.
Look at this.
You see, Sheriff,
I got a sticky problem.
My jurisdiction ends, in a sense,
at the George Washington Bridge.
But half the men I watch
live beyond that bridge...
where no one's watching.
I'm watching.
I can see that. You've got
a crime rate here of about, what?
The lowest
in northern New Jersey.
You got Hoboken and Jersey City
over here. Newark.
We try to do a good job
with what we have.
With a staff of three?
No, Sheriff.
What you got is a town that scares
the shit out of certain people.
Lieutenant, I told you,
I'm watching.
I mean, if you look around you see none
of these people are wearing silk shirts.
Their pools are above ground.
You know?
You raise your family somewhere decent,
I guess that's a crime now.
Lieutenant, look around.
This is a town with a population
of 1,000 people and maybe 30
families are cops. That's it.
- I got news for you.
Not all cops are dirty.
- I'm not saying they are.
Sheriff, I went to the
same academy as our friend out there.
- Who, Ray?
- Yeah. He was a beauty.
He was a real collar man.
But I don't know. Something
happened to him along the way.
You mind if I sit down?
We buried a suit today.
We buried a suit today!
That doesn't bother you?
- He jumped off the G.W.B.
- Yeah, but his body
never hit the water.
That doesn't bother you.
What does?
That I investigate cops?
- Being a man who always pined
to be a cop?
- I am a cop.
Pined to be N.Y.P.D.
Three, four absences...
ten years.
Appeals of hearing tests.
Right?
You may be law enforcement,
and so am I, but you are not a cop.
Now, I may watch cops.
But tell me if I'm wrong.
Every day out these windows,
so do you.
You watch cops too.
And since we are both law enforcement,
we share a duty.
Do we not?
If there is a stink,
we must investigate.
We must gather evidence because
evidence makes us see the truth.
Is this the stink
of a criminal act...
or is it a turd
in the bag?
Babitch isn't dead.
You know that and I know that.
Ray got him
off that bridge alive...
before he could talk.
But he wasn't so lucky the last time
when the shit hit the fan with Tunney.
That boy he took care of later.
But now what?
What does Ray do now?
That's the $64,000 question.
And that's why I'm here.
That's why I'm here,
Sheriff.
Because you're
on the inside.
And besides the church traffic,
and the cats in the trees...
and all that other bullshit,
okay,
there isn't much here for you
to do to keep your mind busy.
But I look at you, Sheriff,
and I see a man who's waiting
for something to do.
And here I am.
Here I am saying, "Sheriff,
I got something for you to do."
- I don't wanna
go through this again.
- It's too fucking bad.
I can't!
I told the boys...
I mean, they're downstairs now
saying goodbye.
- Ray, how many people you got
at this party? The whole 37?
- You got a party downstairs.
Here I am scrambling, cleaning
this thing up for you, and
you're throwing a fuckin' party.
The mayor's gonna suspend this case.
I'm making it happen tomorrow!
But sooner or later, Ray,
they gotta find the body in
that river or it will not hold.
Mets, it's
my sister-in-law's kid!
Didn't you say
he was adopted?
What's up, Freddy?
Ray, this doesn't make things
very easy for me. I mean...
This is a pretty big thing you're having
here the day after. How do you think...
Freddy, what
are you talking about?
This guy came to see me yesterday,
this Moe Tilden from I.A.
- He brought all these pictures and...
- Freddy.
That guy's had a hard-on for me
for years. It's a personal thing.
- He is a scumbag.
- All right.
You know how they recruit at I.A.D.?
They catch you on the take.
And they tell you you can either
do time or join 'em.
Well, he knows you know
Superboy is...
I told him he was dead, Ray.
I told him he was wrong about you, but...
I'm the sheriff. I mean,
I'm supposed to know what's goin' on.
How do you think
this looks?
Go home, Freddy...
and don't think so much.
- Ray, I can't go.
- Freddy...
- Freddy, go home. Go home. Go home.
- I can't go...
Yo, Ross, come over here.
Look at this.
Super!
It's not Murray. It's not Murray.
He's part of a search.
- In Tempe, Arizona.
- Atlanta, Georgia. Atlanta, Georgia.
Murray, Murray.
Listen.
- I want you to have this.
- No, no, Aunt Rose, I'm fine.
Seriously. I gotta go...
Look, Murray, look.
Listen to me.
I want you
to have this.
All right, all right.
You made it for me?
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
- Thank you.
Hi.
Hi.
You guys have
another fight?
We were supposed to have
a big talk.
So I sent Caroline
over to my mom's.
And, um,
and Joey called and told me
that he was stuck,
and that he made
some arrest.
I mean, l...
I can't believe him
when he tells me... anything.
Liz, you wanna
come inside?
I met a little girl
and I settled down
You can get this on CD,
you know... in stereo.
It wouldn't matter
to me.
Oh, right.
We got married
You know, it's a funny thing
when you owe someone your life.
Then little by little
We drifted
from each other's arms
Why is it
you never got married, Freddy?
It was just restlessness
All the best girls
were taken.
And it was somethin' more
I guess
That tore us apart
and made us weep
I'm drivin' a stolen car
Down on Eldridge Avenue
Each night I wait
to get caught
But I never do
- This is crazy.
- Yes.
All right, take it easy.
All right?
All right, Gabriel,
take it easy.
Murray?
Hey, Murray!
Ray's outside
waitin' for ya.
- You comin' or what?
- I'm comin', I'm comin'.
That was
a great party, Ray.
You know, Ray,
it's a really great thing you did.
Makin' a place where everybody
could stick together.
I mean...
you know I know you didn't
have to do this for me.
You could've just...
I just... I wanna let you know
I appreciate it.
I really do.
- Everyone's gone.
- Just us, buddy.
That's it.
I always said to my mom,
"Uncle Ray doesn't like me, but..."
I always liked you,
Murray.
You just sweat
too much.
- Hey, what's doin'?
- Hey, Superboy.
So what are we gonna do now?
I'm gonna go meet some people?
How does this work? I've got all
my bags packed and everything, Ray.
Just I'm a little buzzed.
You know, maybe we could
do this tomorrow or something.
I'm really tired, Ray.
- Where's Joey?
- He's working tonight, kid.
Yeah?
Sorry it came out this way,
Murray.
Ah, it's not that bad, Jack.
Yeah, it is, Murray.
- Fuck!
- What the fuck
is going on here?
What is this? What are you doin'?
What are you doin', huh?
- Stay outta this.
- What the fuck is this?
Ray, you said P.D.A. was gonna
set him up with a new life.
You think I'm all that,
Joey?
Ah, fuck.
Put your files in there.
We're done.
It's over.
- Moe...
- We were shut down
by the mayor. Here.
- What the fuck is this?
- Put your files in there.
The case is closed.
Reuben, what are you doin'?
What are you doin'?
- I'm on hold with the phone company.
- Is that the Garrison file?
Is that a Garrison file?
Give me your Garrison files.
Give me the Garrison files.
- Give me it all. Give me it all.
- All right, all right.
Is that more? I'll take everything.
The case is closed.
The case is fucking closed!
Closed!
The case is closed, finished,
over!
- Go to lunch.
- I, uh...
Go to lunch!
Go!
Hey, go to lunch.
Go to lunch! The case is closed.
Everybody, get the fuck outta here.
Get outta here!
The case is fucking closed!
With community leaders
and pundits crying "Cover up,"
Mayor Farelli's suspension of
the Babitch case is a big gamble...
for his upcoming
reelection campaign.
The decision, however, has scored
big points with the cop vote...
which the mayor
has depended upon in the past.
What do you want?
Are you gonna help us
or not?
Help you help what?
Help Ray here find him?
Help Ray finish cleaning up
his goddamn pool with the guy's head?
Is that it?
Huh, Mr Humanitarian?
You got something
you wanna say to me, Ray?
Or is this about something
a little more personal?
I'm on at 10:00.
I'm outta here.
We all are.
We got another hour.
Hey, come on, Joey.
Instead of taking cop lessons
from a cokehead,
maybe you should be lookin'
at that fire, you know?
My girl over at Chase says Figgs
is missing a few payments.
Where were you that night,
Jack?
I had nothin' to do
with it.
That would be retribution.
And that I leave to God Almighty.
I'm Gandhi.
I'm tellin' ya,
the mob built this town for Ray...
so they could own
a fuckin' precinct.
It's a deep and dark
motherfuck.
What you're feelin'
right now, Freddy,
friendless, angry,
nervous, misunderstood,
this is it,
this is the life.
You're lucky your ear
kept you off the force.
You know...
if I saw Liz...
drowning in the water...
If I saw that today,
I wouldn't go in.
I'd stand there,
and I'd think about it.
And that's the best thing
I ever did with my life.
- So?
- So?
So you wanna sit around your whole life
wishing you were on the force?
Or do you wanna bring the faggot in?
Let him spill.
I wouldn't know where
to begin.
All right.
Brother's in deep shit.
He's down, he's bleeding,
and you gotta get there.
But there's lights, right?
All over the city, red lights.
You go through
the red lights.
Sure, you fire up the roof,
you wail, you go through
the red lights, but that's slow,
fighting your way
through traffic.
The goal is
perpetual motion.
You move diagonal.
You turn the wheel
when you hit a red light.
You don't drive down Broadway
to get to Broadway.
But how does this apply to what
you were saying in there?
It applies, Freddy!
It's just as easy to tail a man
walking in front of him.
Now, you butt heads with these
friends of ours, you're gonna
come at them head-on?
- Okay.
- They got lives, Freddy.
Families.
No.
You move diagonal.
You jag.
Ah, Christ!
Where the fuck are you guys?
Stay cool, Tom,
we're on our way. I need you to wait.
I'm down. But, but Joey,
he's tryin' to hold on,
but this big bastard,
he cut me up.
Stay cool, Tom.
I need your location.
- Agh! He's a fucking monster!
- I need your location!
- I need an assist.
- I can't move.
I think he cut my tendon.
You got a wife, huh?
Huh? You got a baby?
Quit!
Tell me you quit.
I'll let you go.
You go home.
Kiss your wife.
Eat your baby's Fruit Loops and shit.
Belt me, motherfucker,
you're gonna be redeemed.
Re-re-redeemed,
Officer... Randone.
Shit!
- Motherfucker!
- Shit.
It's the roof, Jack.
You got units sent in.
All right,
I'll check the front.
Come on, come on.
Son of a bitch!
Please.
Help! Help!
No! No! No!
In here!
Joey's in trouble,
Ray.
Ray, let's just break
the fuckin' thing down.
Got it.
His father is serving
a life sentence for murder,
murdering an ex-girlfriend...
with a sawed-off shotgun back in 1988.
The New York Times is quoting
one friend of Royster saying...
that the guy had
an I.Q. Of 160.
I need your help.
They're tryin'
to kill me.
- Who?
- Who?
My friends tried to kill me.
Ray Donlan...
tried to kill me.
Shit!
Holy shit!
Speak of the devil!
Freddy, forget it.
I don't get this.
This doesn't make
any sense.
Why'd they get Superboy
off the bridge,
bring him back here
and kill him?
Ray had a plan,
and it got
very fucked up.
Why didn't Superboy go
to New York to get some help?
I don't know. He's got
his Aunt Rosie here. I don't know.
Ray's wired into
the State Police.
He's got friends
in Internal Affairs.
If he wants someone dead,
they're dead anywhere.
You awake, Freddy?
Aw, I feel like shit.
Fuckin' allergy
that's killin' me.
Hey.
In sure and certain hope
of the resurrection to eternal life,
through our Lord,
Jesus Christ,
we commend to Almighty God
our brother Joseph,
and we commit his body
to the ground.
The Lord bless him
and keep him.
The Lord make His face to shine
upon him and be gracious unto him.
The Lord lift up His countenance
upon him, and give him peace.
Honour Guard, retreat.
Hey, Ray.
Hey, Freddy.
I came to tell you...
that Superboy
came to see me, Ray,
a couple nights ago.
He's scared.
He's a fugitive, and he's convinced
you're gonna kill him.
He's a mixed-up kid.
So are you.
Ray, there's gotta be a way
out of this for everyone.
So, I say why don't we all
go in tomorrow together.
Freddy,
I invited men,
cops, good men,
to live
in this town.
And these men, to make a living,
they cross that bridge every day...
to a place where everything
is upside down.
Where the cop is the perp,
and the perp is the victim.
The only thing they did
was to get their families out...
before it got
to them.
We made a place
where things make sense,
and you can walk
across the street without fear.
And you come to me with a plan
to set things right.
Everyone in this city holding hands,
singing "We Are the World."
That's very nice.
But, Freddy, your plan
is the plan of a boy.
You made it on the back
of a matchbook without thinking!
Without looking
at the cards.
I look at the cards.
I see this town...
destroyed.
Now, that's not
what you want, is it?
I look at this town...
and I don't like
what I see anymore.
Who the fuck
do you think you are?
- No, I don't know.
- What the hell
are you doing?
- I just, uh...
I got, I got...
- Call you back.
- Excuse me. I'm sorry.
- Moe, I apologize.
He just walked in here.
I'm sorry for rushing in
like this, but you were right.
They tried to kill him like you said,
but he got away.
Now he's runnin' through
the woods. He's like a scared
animal. He's scared to death.
That motherfucker
should be scared.
His uncle got this case closed
with one phone call.
Look, I'm sorry it took so long
for me to come around,
but you were right.
I couldn't see the truth.
Like you said, the evidence,
my loyalty, they were confusing.
They never give you
any napkins in this place.
What am I
supposed to use?
You want this?
What is this?
You came to me, to my town...
with all these speeches, talking to me
about doing the right thing.
I'm doing the right thing.
What's goin' on? What are you doing?
That was like
two weeks ago.
Two weeks ago?
What about Babitch?
What about him?
Fuck him.
- What about Donlan?
- Fuck him too.
What about
Joey Randone?
He fell off a building.
Don't you read the papers?
Listen, Sheriff,
I'm really sorry...
to have awoken you from your slumber,
but it's over.
Hands are tied now.
You shut me down.
No, listen to me. You're I.A.
That's why I came to you.
You can do whatever you want.
Remember you came to me, said,
"You wanna be a cop?" I'm bein' a cop.
- I offered you a chance.
- I'm asking you for some help.
I need to do something.
- I need to do this for myself.
- Listen, you deaf fuck.
I offered you a chance.
When we could have done something,
I offered you a chance to be a cop,
and you blew it!
You blew it.
You people
are all the same.
That cupcake makes a mess,
we got a case again.
The mob runs millions
in drugs through their precinct,
and everybody gets
a nice house.
Figgs is right.
The mob owns this town.
They closed the case,
Freddy. If they don't have...
- the stomach for it...
- They had to. It's circumstantial.
You don't have anything either.
All that stuff is illegal.
You stole it.
I know this guy.
He's a corrections officer.
They took care of Tunney
when he was gonna talk.
Then how come Figgis didn't do
somethin' about it? He was
Ray's right-hand man back then.
Then they tried
to kill Superboy.
They were hiding him,
Freddy.
Then they burned down Figgsy's house
when they think he might talk.
You don't know that.
We went over every inch of that house.
Not everything is
a hexagonal conspiracy.
I think you been hangin'
around Figgs too much.
He's the only one getting cash
out of that house,
and he's totally playing you...
just like those arseholes
in the city.
And I'm sorry, but... there's nothing
you can do about this.
Yes, there is. I can find Superboy
and I can bring him in.
I'm going back upstate.
I want my old job back.
I don't want any part
of this.
I don't want any part
of this place.
Come on, Cindy.
Geez.
Freddy, look, I don't know
about Ray, okay?
But everyone in Garrison
is not a murderer.
No. They just keep their eyes closed
and their mouths shut just like me.
Hey, Freddy.
All right, thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, sweetheart.
I love you too.
All right,
terrific.
Two in the centre?
Uh-uh. No.
Rules are different for cops.
- I'm losin' my shirt here
with you guys.
- So what do I got to do?
- Five out of six in the star.
- Five out of six.
- Hey, Freddy.
- You a cop too?
Yeah, yeah,
I heard ya.
Enjoy your trip
to the big city?
You gotta hit the next five
to win.
Shit!
I just hope you're not
trying to prove anything, Freddy.
I know some of them
are real arseholes.
You know.
They think they're high priests
or somethin'. I don't know.
But why would they do all this?
You know, maybe they're doin'
the right thing.
Liz, I saw these pictures
of Ray meeting with these guys.
You know, like mobsters.
- Everyone's houses are financed
by these mob banks.
- Says who? I.A.?
Even you said Joey's death
was no accident.
Joey fell off
a building, Freddy! Okay?
Now, I don't need this opened up.
Maybe you do. I don't.
All Joey wanted was a place
for us to live.
Now, who are you to judge that
until you've walked in his shoes?
Maybe that's what you're tryin'
to do with me.
What're you gonna do,
Freddy?
You gonna arrest
the whole town?
You goin' to New York to take
"paint by number" cop lessons?
You know, Ray likes you.
That don't mean
I'm gonna let you fuck him over.
Ray Donlan
gave you this job, Freddy.
You forgot that?
We made your sorry ass!
So now you can do us
a favour, huh?
You could tell us...
where Superboy is.
If I knew where he was,
he'd be in the city already.
You're gonna be hurtin',
Freddy.
You're not gonna know when,
you're not gonna know where.
You're gonna be hurtin'.
You mark my words. I'm watchin' you!
Hey.
- You got your cheque.
- Yep.
Thanks to you, Freddy. Filing out
those forms in such a timely fashion.
You with Liz?
Where're ya goin'?
I don't know.
My leave came, so I thought I'd look
around for a new reality. You know?
Anyway, I'm sure you
could use your privacy, Freddy.
No, no.
No, no.
Look all you want,
Freddy.
You're not gonna find
anything.
I took care of it.
That lady cop...
from the Bomb Squad got you the stuff
to do this with, didn't she?
You didn't know Monica was gonna
be here. Did you, Figgs?
No.
Monica said...
she was going over to her friend's
house to watch some pay-per-view.
The thing was on a timer. I didn't
know she was gonna be here, Freddy.
It's all bullshit.
You, Figgs,
are the bullshit!
Smarten fuckin' up!
You even turned your back on Tunney
when he needed your help.
Figgs! I'm gonna find Superboy,
and I'm gonna bring him in.
And for once, everybody in this town's
gonna tell the truth.
- You gotta find him first, Freddy!
- I'll find him.
Listen to me. I got a cheque in
my pocket for $200,000. I got
a chance to start my life again.
I don't give a shit about this town.
I don't give a shit about that town.
And I don't give a shit
about your fucking justice.
Bein' right is not
a bulletproof vest, Freddy.
Go on, Figgsy, get the hell
out of here. Go on!
Go on, Figgsy!
Go on!
Run away!
Hey, Freddy.
- Ray's not home.
- I know.
I'm lookin'
for your nephew.
I don't know where
he is.
Why the hell would I tell you
if I did?
Rose,
I'm his only chance.
Let's go.
Shut the fuck up!
Would ya, please?
Sh... Fuck!
Yeah.
No, please.
Who was he
supposed to call?
Ray knows everybody.
What am I supposed to do?
Let him go in alone? What?
You know what?
Okay, fine.
Why don't you
go home?
I mean... I wanna be here
for you, Freddy, but...
Lisa's nervous, you know.
She's pregnant.
- I mean...
- So, go on. I'll be fine.
You be careful,
Freddy, huh?
Yeah. You too.
Come on.
Oh, shit!
Get out, you jackass.
I said, get out, buddy.
Oh, Jesus. You guys
don't wanna do this. Jack.
- Don't shit in your pants.
He's not gonna kill ya.
- This is the good one, right?
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Move, move, move!
All right, hit it, Jackie.
Hit it, Jack!
Jesus Christ!
You fuck!
Freddy!
I can't hear you,
Ray.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey.
What're you doin'?
Excuse me, Lieutenant.
Come on, guys, it's cool.
Everything's cool.
Everything's cool. Everything's cool.
Come on. Come on. Everything's cool.
- Where the hell are you goin'?
- Please move.
Holy shit!
Guys, guys, guys.
Beat it. Beat it.
Everything's fine.
Everything's fine. It's cool.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- What the fuck?
Come on, Freddy.
Everything's cool. Everything's fine.
- Wait, wait, wait.
Where do you think you're goin'?
- Call E.M.S. Call E.M.S.
Come on, fellas, back up.
Back up. Back up. Back up.
- He can't hear.
- Reubens, take him.
- Hey, hey, it's all right.
It's okay. It's okay.
- They blew out his ear.
It's all right.
It's all right! It's okay.
It's okay.
Come on.
Go on, Freddy.
Come on inside.
Come on.
So Gary Figgis copped a plea.
Gave up the connection between
Ray, the P.D.A. and the mob.
There were a shitload
of indictments.
And the sheriff,
Freddy Heflin...
You know, there's people on both sides
of the river wish he never recovered.
They cursed the day
he took down Ray Donlan.
But what they don't know,
he figured out.
No one is above the law.
Four cops dead,
and one dead cop resurrected.
In a bizarre twist, Murray
"Superboy" Babitch sits alive
and well in a holding cell...
Sheriff Fred Heflin
apprehended Babitch single-handedly.
...he will
be recovering the hearing in his
good ear so that's good news.
Files
were seized this morning...
Officer Gary Figgis testified
about mob influence and bribery.
Three months since
the shootout in Garrison, New Jersey,
reputed mob boss Toy Torillo has been
indicted on four counts of racketeering.
An unidentified corrections
officer was arrested today...
for the murder three years ago
of Officer Glenn Tunney.
