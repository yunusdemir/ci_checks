My clients believe
the best way to remove someone
from this world is to kill him.
Killing is easy.
It's harder to put the memory behind you.
I'm O.
A Fulltime Killer.
Ito!
What a surprise!
It's me, Takano!
I don't know you.
So glad to run into old classmates here!
I don't know you.
Why don't you speak Japanese?
I work at a sushi restaurant.
Living abroad is lonely.
My wife
and I are expecting our fifth child.
Still play baseball?
If it wasn't for your notes,
I would've flunk out.
No... No!
A friend once said:
In our business
you're bound to rub out someone you know.
What do you want?
My name is Tok.
I'm a professional killer.
I like watching movies.
Especially action movies.
Big or no budget, foreign or local.
As long as they're not boring
and have fresh ideas.
Take this movie from a few years back.
A guy runs around Mexico with a guitar case
blasting people left and right.
Not the best movie.
But I like the style.
I risked my life for this kind of shit money?
You know what?
A bloody cop could make more
than that in a month or two.
The next one is going to cost you.
Who the fuck do you think you are? O?
I'm way better.
For the kind of gigs I pull off,
I deserve double more than O.
O is more efficient, and experienced.
He makes less noise than you.
That's why he gets the job he gets.
And you get shit money!
There's a French movie. Alain Delon.
I can't remember the name
but there's a scene just like this.
Go and get a copy!
I'll call you if I need you!
Fuck!
Lovely.
You knew him?
I meant the guy at the train station.
We were best friends in school.
Too bad.
In our business
you're bound to rub out someone you know.
Be in touch.
Be in touch.
Welcome.
My name is Chin.
I'm from Taiwan. I know Japanese.
I work at a Japanese video
store in Hong Kong.
The customers can never figure out
where I'm really from.
But does it matter?
I'm just an ordinary girl.
Everyday is a routine for me.
Chin.
Broke a bottle of beer.
Take care of it for me.
Thank you.
Ono.
Yes.
That's my apartment across the road.
But I live here.
It's safer for a killer.
Chin comes to my flat
3 times a week
to clean the place for me.
She is my second cleaner.
I pay Chin on the 1st of every month.
We would meet at the same cafe.
We're both shy.
Never have much to say to each other.
Mr. Ono.
Why did you hire me?
There were other ads on the bulletin.
Why me?
I had no experience.
It's probably because
your ad had tear-away
strips at the bottom ...
with your phone number.
I understand. Thanks.
I think I got confused.
It was Nancy's ad that had the strips.
And Chin's ad
happened to be at the same spot.
What's wrong with him?
Thank you.
What a weirdo!
Please come again.
A strange guy showed up this week.
He wears a different mask everyday.
Just like that Hollywood movie.
The main character wears the masks
of American presidents.
I want to see the face under the mask.
Maybe he's good-looking.
A man...
of great confidence.
Let's go to a movie on Saturday.
Didn't you rent this?
But I didn't see it.
I just moved. I don't have a VCR.
But... You rent tapes everyday.
That's why I only rent
movies I've already seen.
Don't worry.
I have a job.
You're a businessman?
I'm a professional killer.
Professional killer?
That's right.
Are you joking?
We suspect your husband's murderer
is a professional killer we're after.
Your husband might know him.
He talked to the killer in Japanese.
They should be friends.
How can that be?
Mrs. Takano, we need your help.
Your full cooperation.
We need your husband's cards
photos and stuff.
Please understand.
Find the man who did this.
I beg you!
Makes you think, doesn't it?
The people you meet in your life.
That's a lot!
Where are you?
Come by the shop on Saturdays.
I love trailers.
They represent the best
a movie has to offer.
Just like when you die,
your life flashes before your eyes.
Even a bad movie
can have a good trailer.
Our lives should be so exciting.
Welcome.
This way please.
What's wrong?
Don't like this place?
Something wrong?
Anything to drink?
She'll have an iced coffee.
I'll have a lemon tea.
You're not Japanese?
I'm Chinese.
I'm not Japanese either.
You're from Taiwan.
I can tell.
So why are you speaking Japanese to me?
I'm going to kill a Japanese guy.
I want to make friends with him first.
But he doesn't speak Chinese.
This syringe contains poison.
After settling for 3, 4 hours,
you drain the water and the tobacco.
What's left is nicotine.
This is your weapon?
Yes.
You remind me of Emu
in Crying Freeman.
She was a quiet girl,
but turned into a sexy woman
when she meets an assassin.
Don't tease me.
Sometimes I almost believe you're a killer.
Give me 15 minutes.
I got to kill some people.
Be right back.
Don't kill me. I'll pay you double!
Triple!
Don't... kill me!
How many do you smoke a day?
Look at you!
Don't you know nicotine can kill?
Successful?
I killed 4 losers
and shot one
up with nicotine.
Better yet,
I gave the shaft to Asia's No.1 assassin.
Want to be a killer's woman?
Where have I seen you before?
He knew we'd trace the fax back here.
Not bad. Just letting us see enough.
It's him, O.
It's not like him to leave a paper trail, right?
He wants us to see him.
He's the best.
Doesn't want his name soiled by a psycho.
He goes by Tok.
No one knows his real name.
He's new, but is catching on quick.
Gets mostly undesirable gigs.
He's reckless and showy,
but works cheap.
And always gets the job done.
He wants attention.
What better way than to challenge you?
You're the top assassin.
That's his plan?
This is a challenge?
Are you asking my opinion?
Last time he put on a show for you.
Telling you to step aside.
It's a challenge for him.
He knows your target, the location,
and that you case
it the night before.
He's watching you.
I'll show you.
Hold it.
That's it. Shoot.
No.
It's not loaded.
Aim ...
That's your target.
Don't worry.
Don't move your elbow.
I've seen this movie. Leon.
Kill him!
Shit!
You okay?
Got you!
Rifle puts a bullet in the
chamber after every shot fired.
What are you doing?
I could've killed him!
Think you're an expert already?
It's your first try.
Don't want to be a killer's woman anymore.
Seeing someone?
I'm not sure.
It's either yes or no.
I've known him for a year.
I clean his flat.
But all this time,
I never saw him there.
Guys hate staying in.
It's not that.
It's like he's never lived there.
The place feels empty.
Once, I put a Snoopy on his table.
You know, those little dolls.
I wanted to give the place some life,
to see if he would notice.
He never said anything.
Now whenever he leaves town,
he'll bring back Snoopys
from different countries.
He likes you.
I'll show you something.
Every time he brings a Snoopy back,
I'd check news from that particular country.
To look for any murders or assassinations.
This is the latest one.
I think the flat is a cover.
A misdirection.
Things are messy when I go up there.
Like someone has been there.
But the mess always looks like ...
it's been done on purpose.
How did you start working for him?
I put up an ad on a supermarket bulletin.
He hired me.
Said what caught his eye
was the ad's tear-away strips.
But my ad didn't have strips.
He confused me with the previous cleaner.
You know what?
The woman I replaced vanished
without a trace.
He said that one day,
she just never showed up for work again.
After I started, the police came
and asked about her disappearance.
Sometimes, I can feel him.
Like he's watching me.
I often change clothes by the windows.
He might be watching.
What's wrong?
If it's the pay ...
That's not it.
I've met someone.
He's... a friend.
He needs me right now.
Really?
Thanks.
Can you find a replacement in 2 weeks?
I'll hate to lose you.
Hi.
Got Chinese Daily and Morning Post?
Yes.
Chinese Daily is on C5.
Morning Post is on F6.
There's an ad in the left hand corner
of the Daily.
Found it.
See the ad in the right hand corner
of the Post?
Remember,
this is how the organization contacts me.
Read the 4th word
of every sentence.
Combine both ads.
Check the Daily first.
Tomorrow... 3:00 pm...
Singapore...
Outram... Park... Station...
You're a fast learner!
My manager is setting me up.
He never gives me a job this fast.
Where are you?
You're somebody.
Someone I've seen before.
Where would we find books on the Games?
Please use the search function
on any of our computers.
Thank you.
We'll search all titles that
begin with the word Games.
Police.
Where's the guy?
I don't know.
How about his clothes?
Black. Maybe grey.
You stay here.
Police! Stay calm!
Show time!
Police Emergency. Can I help you?
Hung, don't look back.
Guess it's your lucky day today.
A smarty is watching you. He's in black.
Do you have a lighter?
Sure.
Police!
Go! Go!
This is the double.
Thank you.
Chinese competitor Lok Tok-wah
is at his peak condition.
The gold is his if he hits the center rings.
He missed!
Lok Tok-wah has collapsed!
History Repeated.
China's Lok Tok-wah
collapsed just like his brother
Lok Gan-wah in 1984.
Find out about Lok Tok-wah and his brother.
An order came in from Macau. Contact me.
Ice said no guns tonight.
I did the job, I want my money.
I see the job through
even when it's a trap.
You got guts, my friend, but no brains.
You obviously don't watch enough movies.
And if you did, you'd know that
when the organization betrays a killer,
he'll pay back twice to the
ones who've wronged him.
Even if he dies trying.
I've asked around.
Tried to find that fucking movie
you were talking about.
No one has heard of it!
Must be a real winner!
What the hell are you laughing at, fucker.
China won her first-ever gold medal
in the free pistol event in 1984.
Lok Gan-wah was in the lead
but he collapsed in the last round,
just like what happened
to Lok Tok-wah in 1992.
His teammate Hui Hoi-fung went on
to win China's first-ever gold medal.
I have the best manager.
When he gives me a job,
everything is taken care of.
I just execute.
Move out of the way.
We're too close.
Any shots we fire will go
through her body first.
She's innocent.
Why hesitate?
You killed your classmate
and hired a cleaner to die for you.
We'll fire on the count to 3.
1, 2, 3!
You don't deserve the No.1 title.
2 hours later,
I realized my manager had betrayed me.
My target was a member of the organization.
I never trust anyone.
That includes my manager.
I gave him the phony address.
But today's Monday!
Chin will come clean the flat!
When faxes come in,
put them on the board.
And don't answer the phone.
Didn't you hit him?
This is not a real gun.
Run for the exit on the count to three.
1, 2, 3!
Sorry.
I'm a professional killer.
Know the industrial building
across from my flat?
Unit 1006. Go there.
You probably have 2 questions for me.
One, why did I betray you?
Two, how am I related to Tok?
He's my brother.
You're Lok Gan-wah?
I almost made history
by winning China's first gold medal.
Will you use your gun today?
No.
You've made a name for yourself.
I'm a thing of the past.
In our business
you're bound to rub out someone you know.
You shouldn't have set O up.
It's not honorable.
Stay out of my business.
The flat is registered under a
trading company called Ashki.
The registered tenant is
a guy named lto Hiroshi.
Guess what? There's an Ito
in Takano's list of classmates.
You think he'll come back?
It's our only chance.
Too bad. There's only one missing.
The Hong Kong Snoopy.
Otherwise it'd be a whole set.
You've got to take things easy,
or you're gonna lose it.
Windows have been changed.
No curtains at all.
It's weird,
'cause you can probably see the whole flat.
How could anyone arrange his home that way?
What does it say?
Ms. Chin, please put all faxes on the board
and make sure they don't overlap.
Thank you, Ono.
Everyone listen up!
The suspect is here in the building.
I want you guys split into 3 groups.
Marco, take a team and guard the exits.
I'm coming down!
Most of the tenants have moved out.
Here's the list.
Get Mike to search from the bottom.
Police! Open up!
If you step out the door with me ...
Your whole life will change.
I can use this!
Freeze!
Jump when I start firing.
Marco.
Copy.
Maintain surveillance.
Wait for my command.
Yes Sir!
Don't even try!
Or they'll shoot you down!
Drop your gun.
Drop your gun!
Move it! Move it!
Get the fuck out of my way!
Ambulance ...
We have a patient.
Female. Gun shot wound.
Massive hemorrhage.
BP 70-50, Pulse 72
RR 32, GCS 243
Arriving in 5 minutes.
It's all in here.
Everything you've ever wanted to know.
It's all yours, but on one condition.
What do you want?
The Snoopys!
You crazy son of a bitch!
Everyone comes into this
world with a role to play.
You learned about me and O,
so I think you ought to write a book.
A book of us.
For the cover,
you could use the picture that O took of me.
The Snoopys!
That night, Tok vanished right before me.
My boss asked me to see a shrink.
I decided to leave. Fuck them!
But I didn't go back to Singapore.
I wanted to stay here in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong was where
Tok and O's story had taken place.
So I guess the book is
meant to be written here.
Sometimes, I didn't feel like writing.
I just couldn't do it.
The whole thing was breaking me down.
But the case files lay there
and kept pushing me forward.
Like Tok had said,
I was the chosen one and I believed him.
If I didn't finish the story,
I would never be released.
But how is one to cap a story
that hasn't run its course?
O and Tok are still out there.
Their rivalry is unresolved.
I've speculated, trying to finish.
But whenever I reach that moment,
Tok vanished right in my face,
I just can't bring myself to continue.
A book without an ending.
I'm writing a book without an ending.
Then, a turning point.
Is Mr. Albert Lee there?
Sorry to bother you.
I'm a friend of Tok's.
Tok asked me to come
so you can finish the story.
Wait ...
That day,
after O took me away from the parking lot,
we hit the road at full-throttle.
And then just when the
excitement started to die down...
Where's Nancy?
I buried her in someone else's grave.
You killed her?
I couldn't save her.
I knew her.
We weren't close,
but she was my only friend in Hong Kong.
Nancy was so full of life.
She often told me
she suspected you to be an assassin.
Then one day she vanished.
I found out when the police came.
Hong Kong is not my home.
Life here can get lonely.
I want excitement in my life.
So I posted an ad in the same place
Nancy posted hers.
I wanted to work for you.
Sorry.
You wanted to?
After I started working for you,
I was sure you're an assassin.
Every time I booked plane tickets for you
I would look for news about assassins.
I collected the articles.
I could feel you across from the street.
For 2 years,
you never came to me.
Let me finish!
But then I met someone else.
He was so different.
He was there for me.
I could talk to him.
And feel him.
He was real.
Am I too late?
You love him?
I'm not sure.
I'm thinking about retiring.
Find a place to live my life in peace.
Come with me?
Will Tok find us?
Do you want him to?
He said the contract he wants the most
is the one for your life.
I'll settle this with him.
Find O. Kill him.
May I help you?
I want to place an ad.
Don't cry.
This one is from me.
You speak fluent Japanese.
Took me 5 years.
So I could talk to you.
Turns out you don't like talking.
How ironic!
With Tok around, things began to lighten up.
Son... of... a... bitch!
Son of a bitch!
Son of a bitch!
Mother ... fucker!
Faster.
Motherfucker!
Everyone had a good time.
Before we knew it, it was 11 o'clock.
It's about time?
It's about time.
I'll be back.
Wait for me.
You play video games?
Yes.
Familiar with Metal Slug?
I can play it all night with one coin.
Good!
Know where the hidden weapons are?
I know it by heart!
Good-bye!
So Tok killed O?
- What was the date?
- July 14th.
- How?
- Micro Uzi.
Did he say anything afterward?
He said he's the gold medalist of assassins.
As a sort of consolation,
they both got what they wanted.
Tok wanted to be legend.
And as for O,
he just wished no one
would've known his existence.
I guess death was the way out.
To seek for virtue and get virtue.
That's right.
They both got what they
wanted in this ending.
Thank you.
Suddenly, I realized how ridiculous
I was being.
The book needs an ending.
When it's sold and turned into a movie,
what it needs is just an ending.
How much of what she said was the truth?
And how much fiction?
Does it really matter?
Who am I to argue with them?
