All right, guys, line up.
Rudy, take that stupid helmet off.
You're not even playing.
Besides, me and Pete,
we're Notre Dame.
You guys, you're Michigan.
Okay, huddle up. Come on.
I got Frank. Todd, you call same play.
I'll hand it off to you.
- You're going to the right.
- Okay, I got it.
- One, two, three, break.
- Break.
Come on, Rudy, get on the ball.
Ready, 42 blow.
- Set, hut.
- One, 1 000, two, 1 000.
Look out.
- Oh, no.
- Rudy, I told you to cut inside.
- Do it right.
- Come on, Todd.
- Try it again. Let's go. Huddle up.
- All right, Todd, same thing, okay?
- Break.
- Break.
- Ready?
- Let's go. Get on the ball.
I'm sick of being all-time center.
- You're sick of what?
- I'm sick of all-time center.
Rudy, I told you five times,
you can't play...
You can't play anything else
but all-time center. You're too small.
- I can too.
- You guys, I'm going.
- I'm sorry. I gotta go to work.
- But, Todd, we need you.
- Come on, Todd.
- Just let Rudy play in my place.
That's a good idea, Frank. Come on,
why don't you let Rudy play?
Okay, you can rush the passer.
- All right, Rudy.
- Through there, just...
- All right, come on, we gotta get them.
- Break.
- Okay.
- Okay, let's go.
- Ready, set, hut.
- Get him, Rudy.
Get him.
Bonvechio to Snow, for the touchdown.
- Yeah! All right!
- Irish win again.
- What a spaz.
- All right, Brad.
We did it. All right. We won. Yes!
- Oh, yeah!
- Yeah!
- Come on, we're gonna be late.
- Let's go, let's go.
Yeah, go for it, Johnny. Go for it.
- Good catch.
- All right.
Get him.
Wait. Wait up.
Run for it, Johnny.
- Yeah, it's pretty big.
- Excuse me.
- There you go.
- All right.
- Thanks.
- Pete, you got your own home?
- Yes, last time I looked.
- You're welcome here anytime.
Excuse me, young lady, who are you?
Sherry Walinski.
- Bob's kid?
- Rudy's girlfriend, Pop.
- She is not.
- Yes, I am.
Everybody around here
has a job at the mill.
But I don't wanna work there.
Where else you gonna find a job
for over 5 bucks an hour?
You got union protection.
You got relatives watching
your front side and your backside.
Where you gonna find such a thing?
Tell me, and God be with you.
- But, Dad, Pat's going there.
- What are you...?
- You gonna give me indigestion here?
- Daniel, leave the boy alone.
Yeah, but this boy can go off
on his own. You heard him.
That's enough.
Now, has anybody else got anything
to say to me before I start this meal?
After high school, I'm gonna
play football at Notre Dame.
You're gonna play football
at Notre Dame?
- Yeah.
- And I'm gonna buy a mansion...
...on Lake Shore Drive.
Rudy...
Sherry, honey, can I get you anything?
What are we watching? Channel 7.
Honey, are you sure you don't
want something to drink?
- Oh, no, that's okay, thanks.
- Yeah.
They'll meet their traditional rivals,
the Trojans, from the University of...
- Mr. Ruettiger, sir?
- Yeah, Pete.
At halftime, could we watch
some of the Indiana-Purdue game?
There's only one team
we watch in this house.
- Right?
- Right.
"Everybody with their hands and
elbows, they won't be sideswiped."
I want the ends in there fast,
every play. Every play...
...we're under control.
Any men in the backfield there I want
you to analyze before you move.
If they throw a forward pass,
wait till you see the ball in the air...
...and then go and get it.
And when we get it, boys,
that's when we go on offense.
That's when we go to them.
We're going inside them.
We're going outside them.
Inside and outside them.
We get them on the run,
we're gonna keep them on the run.
We're not gonna pass unless
our secondary comes up too close.
But don't forget, we're gonna get them
on the run. We're gonna go, go, go.
They're not gonna stop
until we're over that goal line.
And don't forget, men,
today's the day we're gonna win.
They can't lick us in the fight, and
whose men are gonna go in and fight!
What do you say, men?" "Yeah."
Let's go. Ruettiger. Hey, Rudy.
You keep at halfback.
Move that secondary back.
- We gotta get ready for those combos.
- Come on, offense.
Black, 80.
Set, hut.
- Bring it on down, guys. Come on.
- All right, let's go, guys. Let's go.
Come on, Pete. Come on, buddy.
I didn't hurt you, did I?
Okay, that's one new friend.
- Take a knee, guys.
- Let's go, let's go, listen up.
Listen up. For you seniors,
this is your last practice.
And with the exception
of Thomas, Lee, Bo, Sypitch...
You get on the weights.
... Tomorrow night will be the last time...
...the rest of you ever put on
a football uniform.
You know, these last four years
have gone by too fast.
They always do.
And I gotta tell you guys...
...that I really appreciate
the hard work and effort...
...that you've given to me,
to the coaches...
...and to the Hilltoppers.
As a reward, I'm gonna give
each one of you seniors...
...one final hit on me
and my friend down there.
All right. Seniors, stay here.
Underclassmen, two lines,
five yards apart. Let's go.
- Come on.
- Let's go, guys.
Come on, now, big hit.
You're first, McConnell.
Give me your best shot.
Remember, it's gonna be your last.
Let's go.
Good shot. Shower.
Constantino. Come on, David.
Ruettiger.
Get going. Go, go, go, Rudy, go.
Okay, Rudy. Okay.
Hey, Rudy, we're gonna miss you.
You're next, Cunnington.
Come on, Pete.
Lee.
- I can't believe it's over.
- Sypitch.
Wagner.
The bicameral legislature originated
not in the United States, but where?
Rudy, Rudy.
Mr. Ruettiger, would you
be interested in joining us?
- The House and the Senate...
- Don't even try.
If I were giving out grades
for daydreaming...
...you'd be getting an A.
But in civics, you're failing.
You see, ladies and gentlemen...
...the problem with dreamers is
they usually are not doers.
Their achievements are grand
up here...
...but here, where it counts,
they fall short.
Now, the bicameral legislature
originated... Hold up.
I have an announcement.
"If you are a student...
...interested in making the University
of Notre Dame your college choice...
...a bus will be leaving here at 10 a.m.,
Saturday, December 15th...
...for a one-day guided tour
of the campus.
"Please sign up by Wednesday,
November 5th."
Walker, Drummond...
...Matuschak. Okay.
Boston. Good.
And Raciniak. Good.
Whoa, whoa, wait.
Where are you going?
I'm going to see Notre Dame.
Do you have some friends
in South Bend?
No.
Well, then there must be
some other reason.
When you read the announcement,
I thought you said anybody could go.
I'm sorry, Rudy.
This bus is for students...
...who are interested in attending the
university. It's not a sightseeing tour.
Well, maybe someday
I could go to school there.
Father Joseph, would you
take over for me?
- Of course.
- Thank you.
Rudy, you don't have the grades
for Joliet Community...
...much less Notre Dame.
The secret to happiness
in this life...
...is to be grateful for the gifts
the good Lord has bestowed upon us.
Rudy, not everyone is meant
to go to college.
Whittaker. Snider.
Hey, Dad, wait up. What about
this order for three-inch?
We're gonna have to change
the rollers on number 13, stat.
- Thirteen?
- Yeah.
All right, we'll have the crane
ready for you, okay?
Hey, Rudy? Rudy!
You were late again today.
You were late. Get serious.
No special days here.
- What is today?
- Friday.
No, no, I mean the date.
- August 23rd.
- And that is...?
- My birthday.
- Twenty-two big ones.
Oh, Pete, it's starting to go by
too fast.
Well, I know I didn't have time
to wrap it, but, you know...
- Go ahead, open it. No, I know.
- You shouldn't have, Pete.
This is fantastic.
- Yeah.
- Pete, where did you find this?
I was in Gary and I saw it
in this surplus store, and I said...
- ...that's gotta be yours.
- This is unbelievable.
Pete, I don't know how
I'm ever gonna thank you.
How does it look?
You were born to wear that jacket.
Do you know that Ara is the only
head coach in Notre Dame history...
...that encourages walk-on players?
You probably know more about
that team than half the players.
I can't wait to get there.
Guess how much money I have saved up.
What, 20. Thir... Eighty. Fifty.
A thousand dollars.
Well, that's a good start.
You're the only one who ever
took me serious, Pete.
Well, you know what my dad
always said:
"Having dreams is what
makes life tolerable."
- 2205.
- 2209.
That's 2209.
That's the house, Rudy.
Isn't it cute? We can afford this.
And know what else it has,
it's got wall-to-wall carpeting.
It has a fireplace.
And a big kitchen.
It's close to the schools.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
It's great, Sherry. It's great.
You did a great job.
Look, buddy. I've put in my time.
I've been very patient waiting for us
to get this money together...
...so we could get married
and do this right.
You owe me. Come on.
I think you're gonna like it.
- Hey, Joe, what do you know?
- Not much.
Mary Ann, could I get another beer
down here, please?
Sure, coming right up.
Hey, Pete, what are you doing
tomorrow night?
A little TV.
Coach Parseghian is speaking
at the Chicago Gridiron Club.
- You wanna go?
- Sure.
If Rhonda will let me
stay out that late.
Tell her the D train gets back
no later than 10:30.
- Oh, sure, of course.
- Ara Parseghian?
You just can't give it up.
He's the greatest coach
in the country, Frank.
Are you gonna get his autographed
picture and kiss it every night?
What is your problem?
Or maybe he'll give you permission
to wipe his ass.
- Hey, why don't you leave him alone.
- You mind your own business.
As long as my brother talks
this crazy Notre Dame shit...
...he deserves anything
that comes his way.
Hey, you were a pretty big
Notre Dame fan.
Yeah, I used to collect
baseball cards too.
Forget about it.
You know what Coach Gillespie
said about you, Frank?
- Pete.
- He said you had a lot of talent.
But your problem was
you were too afraid of getting hit.
- You had no guts.
- Go to hell, Pete.
- Come on.
- It's okay.
He used to tell me, if you had
one half of Rudy's heart and desire...
...you could have been
all-conference.
He said you were a pussy.
Hey. Frank!
Hey.
Come on, Frank.
- Rudy! Rudy, that's enough!
- All right! All right!
That's enough, you hear me?
Do you hear me?
That's enough!
Frank. Good.
Don't nothing ever change?
Throw them out, Mary Ann.
You didn't have to get into it
with Frank like that.
I can take care of myself.
I know you can.
That was between him and me.
Ever since he started working here,
he's been pissed off at the world.
Yeah, because he's not the same
kind of god around here...
...that he was in high school.
It's that damn pipe head again.
Emergency water.
We got a breakout!
- Rudy, I need more water!
- I'm not getting anything!
Try another valve!
I'm not getting anything, Pete.
- Come on, goddamn it.
- There's no pressure in the line!
We need to get out of here,
there's no pressure!
Try something!
Pete!
Let us pray.
Oh, God, who alone are ever merciful
and sparing of punishment...
...humbly we pray you in behalf
of the soul of your servant, Peter...
...whom you have commanded
to go forth today from this world.
Do not hand him over to the power
of the enemy...
...and do not forget him forever...
...but command that this soul
be taken up by the holy angels...
...and brought home to paradise.
So that, since he hoped
and believed in you...
...he may not undergo
the punishments of hell...
- ...but rather possess everlasting joys.
- I'm so sorry.
- Through Christ our Lord, amen.
- Amen.
You okay?
You wanna just go home?
I'm going to South Bend.
Now is not the time.
If I don't go now, I'll never be any
good for you, or for me, or anybody.
I'm sorry.
Well...
...if you have to go,
then you'll have to go alone.
I know.
I'm sorry.
Dad...
...what are you doing here?
You can take a couple of weeks off.
Your grandfather saved
all of his life...
...to bring the family to this country.
He got a good job on the stockyard,
he had a nice little house...
...South Chicago.
When I was about 12...
...somebody sold him on the idea he...
He ought to move to the country...
...and become a dairy farmer.
He buys some land, you know,
and gets a couple hundred cows.
Within five months, every one of
those cows was dead with disease.
It was the Depression.
Couldn't sell the land...
...there was no work...
So one day...
...he took off.
Didn't come back.
My brothers and me, we split up
to live with friends or relatives.
Chasing a stupid dream...
...causes nothing but you and
everyone around you heartache.
Notre Dame is for rich kids...
...smart kids...
...great athletes. It's not for us.
You're a Ruettiger.
There's nothing in the world
wrong with that.
You can have a damn nice life.
Frank is gonna take over
plant number two.
A couple years, he'll make
more than me and Johnny.
You know he's in charge of
the expansion program.
I don't wanna be Frank or John.
Excuse me, I need to see somebody
about going to school here.
Now?
Admissions office doesn't open
for another couple of hours, yet.
There's gotta be somebody
I can talk to now.
Please?
Well...
...you could always talk to a priest.
Maybe that's what you need, son.
Yeah, I'd appreciate that.
Just a minute.
Mr. Ruettiger?
- Rudy.
- I'm Father Cavanaugh.
How long have you thought
about this decision?
For as long as I can remember.
I used to watch...
Have you taken the proper steps,
investigated the process?
Yes. I have more to learn, but...
Are you fully aware of the sacrifices
you're gonna have to make?
I am.
I'll do whatever it takes.
What brought you here today?
I just came from my best friend's
funeral. He said that...
Of course.
What do you mean, "Of course"?
Well, son, it's very common for people
suffering a crisis...
...to seek escape into the cloth.
We usually recommend a grieving...
- Escape into the cloth?
- That's just an expression we use...
...to describe people who are running
from emotional or psychological pain...
...by choosing priesthood.
You think I wanna become a priest?
Don't you?
Nothing against being a priest, Father,
but I don't think it's for me.
Why are you here?
I want to go to school at Notre Dame.
Well, have you applied?
No, my grades have never been
very good, even though I tried.
But I'll try harder.
I'll study 20 hours a day, if I have to.
This university...
It's not for everybody.
Ever since I was a kid,
I wanted to go to school here.
And ever since I was a kid,
everyone said it couldn't be done.
My whole life...
...people have been telling me
what I could do and couldn't do.
I've always listened to them,
believed in what they said.
I don't wanna do that anymore.
Okay, Mr. Rudy.
Here's the deal...
...Holy Cross Junior College is nearby.
I can get you one semester there.
You make grades...
...you get another semester.
Then maybe, with a high enough GPA...
...you might have a chance
of getting into Notre Dame.
Hey, kid!
You're not supposed to be here.
Hey, this place is really
something else, huh?
Someday, I'm gonna come out
of that tunnel and run onto this field.
Well, it ain't gonna be this day.
I'm here to play football for the Irish.
Coach Parseghian know about it?
No, not yet.
Well, maybe you best tell him first.
Yeah, you're right.
Yeah, that's what I should do.
Thanks.
I'll see you around.
Is he expecting you?
- No, but this will just take a second.
- Now just a moment young man...
- Coach, can I talk to you for a second?
- Sorry, coach, I tried.
- No, it's all right. I've got it.
- Shall I close the door?
No. How can I help you, son?
I'm Rudy Ruettiger.
I'm here to talk about playing
football for Notre Dame.
Our walk-on tryout date
was two weeks ago.
I'm not talking about this year. I was
thinking more about next springtime.
Are you a student here?
No. I'm at Holy Cross.
But I'm gonna be a student here.
See, I've been a Notre Dame fan
for as long as I can remember...
...since I was a little kid.
In high school, I started...
Is it all right if I sit down?
In high school,
I started at cornerback.
I mean, I wasn't the quickest guy
on the team, but...
Or the biggest.
... But I led the team in tackles.
But, anyway...
...I've been working at a steel mill
for about four years...
...and I've been saving up my money.
And I've been planning on coming here.
My friend Pete, he really understood
what my dream was.
And he told me not to
waste any more time.
But I don't know.
For some reason, I couldn't...
See, he died in an accident on Friday.
And I came here
right after the funeral.
You see what I mean?
Son...
...I think you're in the wrong office.
Come on, now.
I don't understand, coach.
You might want to go over and talk to
Father Cavanaugh at the rectory.
I talked to Father Cavanaugh, he's the
one who got me into Holy Cross.
- He did?
- Yeah.
He said that if I got good enough
grades at Holy Cross...
And I will, I promise.
... I'd be able to get in here, officially.
Anyway, I just wanted
to introduce myself...
...and say I look forward
to seeing you at practice.
- Thank you.
- So long.
Sorry.
For us, divine inspiration does not
mean that God possesses a man...
...and simply dictates
the inspired text to him.
Rather, that God implants
into a man's mind...
...the general concept.
And when God does that...
...he allows the man to write that in the
historical context in which he lives.
What we call the Sitz im Leben,
or that is, "the setting in life."
So a man may have
historical inaccuracies...
...but God allows a man to write
with those misunderstandings...
...because what is important and
inherent is the theological concept...
...that God is trying
to get across to mankind.
I think that's all for today,
ladies and gentlemen...
...we will have a quiz on Monday,
so please prepare yourselves for it.
Well done, Father.
Would you grade these for me,
Dennis. I'd appreciate it.
- Certainly.
- Thank you.
You learning stenography or what.
Everything he's mouthing's
in the goddamn book.
I gotta make an A in this class.
Just remember your Sitz im Leben,
and it shouldn't be a problem.
- You're gonna be great.
- Hey, Nicky. Nicky.
I'm not talking to you, man.
Not after what you did.
You brought a girl
to the party to meet me...
...and the next thing you know,
she sits next to Brian...
Hi, could you hold this?
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.
So you're interested
in a room to rent?
- I don't know, maybe.
- Yeah?
My brother has a house
about five blocks from campus.
I'm sick and tired of...
- I have an extra card I can give you.
- Just forget it.
Forget it. I'll see you.
- If you're interested, call soon.
- All right.
- Maybe tonight. All right, bye.
- Bye.
You don't have a goddamn clue, do you?
About what?
About how to get an A in that class.
I could help you.
Look, besides being
an honor student at Notre Dame...
...and a TA in Father:
I'm also a tutor for hire.
I can't even afford a room to rent.
Wait, maybe we can make
some other kind of deal.
What kind of deal?
Well...
I got Notre Dame pretty well
staked out, you know.
Staked out?
Girls. I just don't know if here,
at Holy Cross...
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
I don't know the girls here
at Holy Cross. I was wondering...
- What's your point?
- Well, maybe you could...
What...?
- Just introduce me to a few...
- I don't know any girls here.
So be it.
Wait a minute.
Hey, wait.
Hey, wait a minute.
Maybe I do know some girls.
In fact, I know a lot of girls.
- I just gotta find them.
- That's the spirit.
As you can see, I'm pretty
goddamn desperate.
I'm D-Bob.
- Rudy.
- And I'm in love.
- Oh, hey, how you doing?
- Don't say anything.
Hey, that's a pretty sweater you're
wearing. This is my friend D-Bob.
He's feeling not well.
Will you cut it out?
I got an image around here.
Branski twisted his knee.
He's not gonna make next week's...
- This the practice field, right?
- All practices are closed.
- I know Coach Parseghian.
- Are you...?
- I talked to him the other day.
- Watch out.
I'm getting real tired
of doing the drills...
- Step back, okay?
- All right.
Hey, coach!
Hey, you gotta keep your eyes open
around here, kid.
Hey, coach.
Coach Parseghian...
...anything I can do to help the team,
you just let me know.
See you.
- Who's that?
- Your lunch breaks...
...are long, now go plug in
the end zone.
- Okay, boss. Right, boss.
- Tell Jake I need to talk to him.
What did I tell you about trespassing?
They said you're the guy in charge,
the guy I need to talk to.
- I need your help.
- Why should I help you?
I wanna be your assistant.
I don't need an assistant,
I've got a full crew.
Couldn't you use somebody else?
I mean, I'll work for free.
What's in it for you?
I volunteered to help the
football team... Do anything I can...
...but they wouldn't let me
because I'm not a student.
But I will be.
If I'm gonna play on this field,
I need to know the lay of the land.
You're nuts.
A lot of people have been saying that.
Well, you've gotta be nuts,
you want to work for nothing.
I just wanna be a part
of this university.
Okay.
Meet me here tomorrow, 10 a.m.
- Thanks.
- Minimum wage.
- Thanks again.
- All right.
Did you understand?
You're not listening, you don't
understand what I'm saying.
- Let me help.
- You sure?
- Yeah, yeah, no problem. Here.
- I got it.
- Keep it straight, kid.
- Okay.
- Poet. Scholar.
- Dickinson. Dickinson. Dickinson.
Hut-hut. Blue and gold, let's go.
- Hi there, what's your name?
- Donna.
- Great. My name's Rudy Ruettiger.
- Hi, I'm Colleen.
- I've got this buddy, D-Bob.
- D-Bob? With the two watches?
You mean "Mr. Marshall Field's"?
- His name's D-Bob, he's a sweetheart.
- Well, maybe I'll see you around later.
- No, I have class.
- I sit behind you in 235.
- Two watches.
- Two watches.
Don't read the question if it's a
long test in a short period. Right?
- All right.
- Two of them will be similar.
It's gonna be one of those two.
One's absurd, forget about that one.
All right, this is important, though.
"Psychological or changed
behavioral responses"...
- What do you think?
- Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt...
...but I just have to ask you,
have we met somewhere before?
You know, you look
really familiar to me.
Maybe psych class. Do you have
that on Monday, Wednesday, Friday?
I'm in there at 10:00.
Yeah. Yeah, he's in that class.
I bet that's where.
I knew you looked familiar.
Well, anyway, this is kind of
embarrassing, but...
...you heard about the dance
on Saturday night, right?
- Right?
- Yeah, we've heard about it. Sure.
Okay. All right, well, you know,
I was just wondering...
...do you have any plans?
- No.
- No.
That's great.
So you're available, huh?
- D-Bob would love to go.
- Really? This is so great.
I would love to introduce you
to my roommate, Elza.
Elza, come here.
Hi.
D-Bob's suspicious, so he made me
go to a language lab to take tests.
They said I have
a slight case of dyslexia.
It's like when the words get all mixed
up in your head when you're reading.
I've been doing these
exercises to get better.
And guess what.
I got an A on a literature test.
Oh, that's great, kid.
Hey, do you live in here?
Believe it or not, got my own home.
That cot's for when
my sciatica acts up.
Okay, let's go to work.
- See that hose on top of the locker?
- Yeah.
Bring that with you.
So you're in student housing?
No, I'm living with a friend in town.
Where in town?
- I haven't found a place to stay yet.
- Funds pretty low, huh?
All my savings went for tuition.
I shower at Holy Cross. I'm getting
by all right. So this is it, huh?
Yeah, this is where it all
starts and finishes.
"I've gotta go, Rock.
It's all right. I'm not afraid."
Sometime, Rock,
when the team's up against it...
...and things are wrong and
the breaks are beating the boys...
...tell them to go in there and
win just one for the Gipper.
I don't know where I'll be then,
Rock, but I'll know about it...
"...and I'll be happy."
The Four Horsemen.
Knute Rockne.
Moose Krause.
Angelo Bertelli.
Johnny Lujack.
Leon Hart, Terry Hanratty,
John Huarte, Jack Snow.
John Lattner.
Paul Hornung
could've dressed in this locker.
We got work to do, kid.
"We're gonna go inside. We're gonna
go outside. Inside and outside."
We're gonna get them on the run.
We're gonna keep them on the run.
And then we're gonna go.
Go, go, go!
We're not gonna stop
until we're across that goal line.
This is a team they say is good.
Well, I think we're better than them.
They can't lick us.
"What do you say, men?"
By the way, Gipper,
I got your gym card.
- You got it. That's great.
- Wait, we had a deal.
- I do your laundry for two months.
- It was harder to get than I anticipated.
- It's gonna be a semester.
- Of doing your laundry?
- Come on, let me see.
- A semester.
All right, fine.
Just let me see the card.
- Come on, that's impossible.
- It's your job to give it a shot.
- She's out of our league.
- Hi.
Tell her I'm a "Field's."
As in Marshall Field's.
She'll know. Just tell her that, please.
- Okay, see you later.
- See you.
That looks great. I think you'll
really enjoy it, thanks a lot.
Hi, are you interested in joining
a student activity?
- Yeah.
- Here's your choices.
Do you see that guy over there?
Over by the pillar.
Could you maybe wave at him
a little bit? Just kind of humor him.
Please?
Hi.
I'm gonna be late. I'll see you later.
- That was perfect. Thank you.
- Well?
Choir looks good.
I used to sing in the high school choir.
- What's Football Boosters?
- We organize the pep rallies...
...and paint the helmets
the night before.
And do the card section.
The actual football helmets?
You guys...
That's me. That's definitely me.
Where do I sign?
- Right here.
- I'm sorry. I can't help you with that.
You are a student
at Notre Dame, right?
Yeah. Why, don't I look like one?
Oh, no, we're just supposed to ask.
Yeah, no, I'm Notre Dame
gold and blue, through and through.
Well, the first meeting
is tomorrow night at the ACC, 7:00.
- See you there.
- All right. Bye.
- Bev, you coming?
- Yeah, wait up.
- Strike?
- Out.
She has a boyfriend who's on
the football team or something.
- You looked like you were in.
- Well, I'm sorry.
You look awful goddamn
happy about this.
Thank you.
- Did you take care of the field passes?
- Chuck hasn't given them to me yet.
- Mary.
- All right, balls home. White, shark...
- Ball visitors, code black...
- Mary.
Oh, and also remember,
you guys, that you return...
- Watch yourself.
- Oh, sorry.
All your...
Hey...
...isn't this fantastic?
Did you know they put
24-karat gold in the paint?
- What's your name again?
- Rudy Ruettiger.
I need your student ID
to get your card section pass.
Well, I don't have it now,
but I'm gonna get it.
- I can have it for you by tomorrow.
- I gotta send the names in tonight.
Well, couldn't you let it
slide this once?
It's the rules, sorry. Next game.
Are you gonna come to Corby's? It's
where we all go when we're through.
Yeah, I'll be there. Thanks.
Fox, is that Bob Gladieux and Ron
Dushney sitting at the end of the bar?
- How about another one?
- Sure.
Now, that's a game to remember.
1966 against Michigan State.
Gladieux caught the greatest pass
in Notre Dame football history.
Hey! Mary, Mary, quite contrary.
What makes your garden grow?
Excuse me, could I get change
for a dollar, please?
Thank you.
You all right?
Yeah. I just wanted to say it's
been a pleasure working with you.
- Thanks.
- You said you were the greatest...
...Notre Dame football fan in history.
I thought I was, so I guess that means
we got something in common.
In fact, I'm gonna be playing football
for the Irish next fall.
It's true. I've talked to
Coach Parseghian about it.
You see, I'm at Holy Cross for
a semester, maybe two at the most.
But Father Cavanaugh says
if I make the grades...
...that I'll have
a real good shot at getting in.
And for the first time in my life,
my grades have been really good.
You're not a Notre Dame student?
Not officially, no.
But I will be next semester.
Then you can't be
a part of the Boosters.
- I'm sorry.
- Mary, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Can you please
just forget I said that?
You know what a tremendous fan I am.
It's the rules.
I know, but...
Damn.
Come on.
- Hi there. I need one ticket.
- No way.
- Hey, mister, 10 bucks for a ticket.
- Ten bucks? You're about 90 short.
Hey, kid, can I buy
that ticket from you?
Yeah, for 20 bucks.
Notre Dame all-American...
- Please, can I get in? I got 10 bucks.
- I couldn't do it. I'd lose my job.
Really.
I'd like to, buddy.
... hands off to Eric Penick
for the Notre Dame touchdown.
Penick 2 yards for the Irish TD.
Do you have an extra
ticket? Please?
- Just one ticket. I just need one seat.
- I'm sorry, no.
Point after attempt
is good. The score...
...the Irish, 7,
Northwestern, nothing.
Fortune, did you see Eric Penick's
kickoff return yesterday?
- Nope.
- I saw it on TV.
He broke free right about here.
The 40. The 35. The 30!
The 25! The 20! The 15!
The 10! The 5! Touchdown, lrish!
Hey, hey, hey, we got work to do.
Down, set, hut!
- You ever see a game from in here?
- Nope.
Well, then your first game
will be one I'm playing in.
Whatever you say, kid. You gonna
watch me or are you gonna help me?
Hey, Fortune,
thanks for the blanket and the key.
I don't know nothing about it.
Well, then who put the key on the cot?
You hear what I just said?
Yeah.
All B's.
And an A.
I know my grades have gone down,
a bit, Father, but...
...I have a lot of
extracurricular activities.
You did a good job, kid.
Those admissions people,
you never can tell.
They're a funny bunch of squirrels.
Have I done all I can?
Excuse me.
Hi, I need box 620, please.
Thank you.
"Dear Mr. Ruettiger,
Your application for admission...
...to the University of Notre Dame
has been evaluated by..."
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas to you.
Tommy, where did you get that?
Oh, you're all sticky.
Well, it's okay, but it's just gonna
get everything all over the place.
- Rudy.
- Rudy.
Where have you been for so long?
I've been going to college
at Holy Cross. It's in South Bend.
If you're going to Holy Cross, how
come you got the Notre Dame jacket?
- Going there next year.
- That's where I'll go too.
- Oh, yeah?
- Do you want something to eat?
An A and three B's.
Good for you.
They held Atlanta to two field goals
in the second half.
I didn't make it into Notre Dame this
semester. I saw a couple home games.
I thought about you. You would have
loved it. You gotta come for a game.
It's so exciting. You've never...
I watch the games here on my
television. That's fine for me.
I know, but it's not the same thing.
What if I were in the game?
Jesus, we still have
to listen to this crap?
That semester at college
didn't make you any smarter.
I'm glad you made good grades.
Come on, Johnny. Please tell me.
It wouldn't be a surprise if I tell.
You can do better than that.
Okay, one more hint.
Okay...
Johnny boy, aren't you gonna wish
your little brother Merry Christmas?
How you doing, Rudy?
Fine.
I just want to tell you that you going
to college and all, I think...
I think that's great.
Thanks, Johnny.
I'll be in the kitchen.
I gotta go.
Why don't you stay for a while?
- I have to go to work.
- Rudy, I'm sorry.
I just want to tell you that
I hope you make it. I do.
- Thanks, Sherry.
- I do.
Hi.
Twelve o'clock. Closing time.
- Thanks, Mrs. Mackenzie.
- No problem.
Thanks.
Yeah, vacation, that's all I hear
from you. "I'm gonna go on vacation."
Okay, after this game you're
gonna pay my money, right?
What about the end of the month?
It's Garowitz's stuff.
Total failure.
Everything I did.
Work, the studying, four hours
a night's sleep in a dungeon.
I've blown another year of eligibility.
This entire year's been a waste.
A waste, huh?
You got your head so far up your ass
about that damn football team...
...you don't get the fact you just got
one year of top-quality education.
"Waste."
Don't be wasting my time.
Ain't you got some work to do?
- Play, man.
- Some nasty cards.
- Hut, hut!
- Good, looking very good.
Watch his head. Watch his head.
First three chapters for next week.
Start thinking about those.
Thank you.
Damn it!
We gotta do our own cooking,
and gotta do our own laundry.
We're not very good at that either.
- You gonna invite me?
- You'll be the first one.
- First? I'm gonna be the guinea pig?
- If you live through it, why...
- Oh, excuse me.
- Sure.
Taking your appeal to a higher court.
I'm desperate.
If I don't get in next semester,
it's over, done.
Notre Dame doesn't accept
senior transfers.
Well, you did a hell of a job, kid,
chasing down your dream.
I don't care. If it doesn't produce
results, it doesn't mean anything.
I think you'll discover that it will.
Maybe I haven't prayed enough.
I'm sure that's not the problem.
Praying is something
we do in our time.
The answers come in God's time.
Have I done everything I possibly can?
Can you help me?
Son, in 35 years of religious studies...
...I've come up with only two
hard, incontrovertible facts:
There is a God...
...and I'm not him.
Is there anything in box 620, please?
"... has been approved.
You've been accepted as a freshman
for the fall semester..."
Oh, thank God.
- Excuse me.
- Sorry, man.
- What's wrong?
- Read it.
"Congratulations, you are..."
I did it.
You did it.
Hey, guys?
My son's going to Notre Dame.
All right, Rudy. Way to go!
Hey, you guys!
My son's going to Notre Dame!
You hear that, Johnny?
Your brother's going to Notre Dame.
Can you believe it, Frank?
Congratulations.
So listen, you wanna work
until it's time to go to school?
I gotta get back, Pop.
Football tryouts start this week.
I'll call you.
One, two, three...
...four, five, six...
...seven, eight!
One, two, three, four...
...five, six, seven, eight.
Let me tell it to you
as clean as I can.
We have 95 players here...
...so accomplished as athletes
in high school...
...we gave them full scholarships...
...to the best football program
in the country.
NCAA regulations allow us
to dress just 60 for home games...
...which means at least
35 scholarship players...
...are gonna be watching
from the stands.
So if any of you has any fantasies
about running out of that tunnel...
...with your gold helmet
shining in the sun...
...you best leave them right here.
Of you 15 dreamers out there,
maybe we'll keep one or two.
My job is to basically beat the shit
out of you for the next five days.
And whoever is still standing
at the end...
...maybe we'll use
for our scout teams.
You'll be running
the opposition's plays...
...week in and week out.
Your greatest value to us is
we don't care whether you get hurt.
Our first teams are gonna
pound on you...
...like you're their worst enemies.
Like what you hear so far?
Any of you want to run home to Mama?
Now's your chance.
Joe, they're all yours.
Don't just stand there trying to think.
Let's hit those ropes. Move it!
Move it, I said! Come on!
Pick them up, pick them up!
High knees!
Let's go, gentlemen, let's go!
Pump your arms, keep your heads up.
That's it, don't step on that rope!
Up and down, let's go! Quickness.
We want to see how quick you are.
A little to the right, little men.
Keep it rolling, keep it rolling.
Heads up, keep moving, keep moving.
Pump those arms, pump those arms
when you're backwards running.
Move them, move them, move them!
Keep your heads up,
keep your heads up!
Run!
Gonna have any quit? Let's go.
Watch the ball.
Get in there, Ruettiger, get in there!
All right, let's concentrate
and get it right. You, come on.
- Go hard, charge him.
- Okay, set.
Hike!
- Set.
- Let's go.
Hike!
What is that? What is that?
What are you doing? Come on!
Who has the play?
Who wants to do it right?
- I got it.
- Come on.
- Right, stay low. Stay low and get it.
- Set.
Get through that.
- Come on, let's do it again!
- Now you hit.
- Go on, get out of here.
- Come on, coach, I can do it.
- Oh, yeah? All right, we'll see.
- Yeah.
Stay low.
This is where we separate
the men from the girls.
Thirty, hit the spot.
Come on, pick it up, pick it up,
pick it up.
Get in there. Pick him off, pick him off.
Right there. Pick him off, damn it!
All right, all right, all right.
Come on, 27, let's get in there.
Let's see if you wanna
make this team, damn it.
Come on, dig in.
Relax for a few minutes.
Coach, if it was up to me,
I'd get rid of all of them.
John, if they can't protect themselves,
I don't want them.
- The kid with blood all over his jersey.
- Ruettiger?
Have you been watching?
No athletic skill.
He's put more effort than
any two guys we've got.
You fellas decide.
Not in my defensive backfield.
You want him, you got him.
All right, shower up.
We'll let you know.
You think you made it?
Unfortunately, yeah.
What is so unfortunate
about making the team?
This is my third year as a walk-on.
I had scholarships
to two Big 10 schools...
...but my father
was an all-American here...
...so I get a lot of family pressure.
I don't understand.
If you haven't been cut,
then you still have a chance.
- What, a chance to play?
- Yeah.
The only reason they keep me on here
is because I'm a legacy.
To them, I'm no more valuable
than a tackling dummy.
Ruettiger, come with me.
Yeah, coach.
You want on the team pretty bad.
You have no idea.
- Sure busted your balls out there.
- Coach, I'll do anything.
Now, you think you can give
the same effort...
...day in and day out
for the next five months?
Sir, I have no doubt.
Fine.
If you do lighten up one hair...
...I'll throw your butt off this team
so fast you won't know what hit you.
Wait a minute, throw me off the team?
I gotta be on the team first, right?
- Don't let me down, kid.
- Does that mean I'm on the team?
- Yeah, kid, you're on the team.
- Thank you!
Hey, hey, come on.
Go put some shoes on.
Yeah, we're gonna have to replace
these supports over here.
Give me a hand.
Thanks for everything.
- Here.
- What's that?
It's the key to the maintenance room.
Don't know nothing about it.
Yeah...
Remember, you promised.
You'll come see your first game
if I ever dress.
You got a nut on you?
Well, I'll stop by every now and again,
just to bother you.
See you later.
Hey, kid.
You ever dress...
...I'll be there.
Sloppy! Run it again.
Sloppy, for chrissake!
Thirty-eight counter.
The back missed the hole.
- He's gotta go to the outside.
- Okay, coach.
You all right, man? Come on, get up.
- Get in the huddle, man.
- Ruettiger.
Ruettiger, get out.
I can do it, coach!
- Right, let's go, boys.
- Yeah.
- Ready?
- Right, let's go, fellas.
And hut!
Hey, what are you doing?
Don't treat me like your kid brother.
I'm playing defenseman for Purdue.
You ain't here to be no nanny
in no kindergarten!
- Now, go play ball.
- Hit me, man.
Red 40!
Set, hut!
Keep your ass down.
Get your ass down, boy.
- Come on, get in here.
- Huddle. Huddle up, guys.
So on Eagle,
do I go on "set" or "two"?
Gotta go on "set."
You gotta pick the man up.
On Eagle Slant, do I let him slide
or do I pick him up too?
Hey, little buddy. Hold up, man.
I'm not talking to you.
Keep going.
I wanna tell you, I'm sorry
about what happened at practice.
Don't be sorry.
Man, if you don't cool it, you're gonna
end up getting yourself killed.
If I cool it, I won't be helping you guys
get ready for the next week's games.
Got it?
I got it.
He's just a showboat, man.
That's all he's about.
He's just doing his job, Jamie.
Can it.
Go Irish!
Break!
- Let's go. Come on.
- Come on, here we go.
Stick it to him, stick it to him!
Watch and learn. Watch him.
Let's go, Rudy!
Hey, what are you doing, huh?
Come here.
- Hey, break it up. Break it up.
- Get off of me!
- Come on, Ruettiger.
- Get out of there.
Break it up. Break it up, I said.
And cool down.
You brown-nosed suck ass!
You suck ass!
- Ruettiger, get back to the huddle.
- What's your problem, O'Hare?
Last practice of the season and this
asshole thinks it's the Super Bowl.
Why, you just summed up your entire
sorry career here in one sentence.
If you had the heart of Ruettiger's,
you could have made all-American.
As it is, you just went
from the third team to prep team.
Go on, get out of here.
Get me another tailback.
- Huddle!
- Come on, let's run it.
Come on, let's rock some ass.
Come on now.
- Huddle!
- Let's go. Defense, come on out.
Now, Rudy, I want you to ice this
twice more in your room tonight.
We'll see you tomorrow.
And keep that pack on that shoulder
for at least 15 more minutes.
Hey, Jim.
Your bullshit is making us all look bad,
so why don't you dial it down a notch.
- Dial it down?
- Everybody's getting sick of hearing:
"Put out more like Ruettiger."
What do you get out of getting
your head kicked in every day?
It's not worth it, you know?
You gotta be in one play
during a regular game...
...to go down in the books
as officially being part of this team.
Only uniform you're gonna
be putting on...
...is that grungy thing
you've been wearing.
Man, if you hate it so much,
why don't you just quit?
I can't.
Why not?
If I quit,
my father won't pay my tuition.
Is that the only reason you're here?
Part of me is under
the delusion that...
...I might get a chance to
run out that tunnel.
What does he think, I'm lying to him?
Nobody said nothing about lying.
Do I have to get pictures taken
of practice to prove I'm on the team?
- I believe you, Rudy.
- What happened to my face?
Where did I get these?
Professional wrestling?
- So, you're a glorified water boy.
- Oh, you just don't get it.
If you are on that team, my opinion
of Notre Dame football hit the shits.
- Leave him alone.
- There's no "if."
I wear a uniform, I block and I tackle.
You just don't understand.
Actually, it's really simple.
Every Saturday when we turn on
the TV to watch the Irish play...
...a lot of players wear
the blue and gold.
- We just don't see you.
- Shoot it, Frankie.
- You will.
- What did you say?
You will. Now shoot.
Just shoot.
Coach, Rudy Ruettiger's
here to see you.
Send him in.
This won't take long, coach.
First, I'd just like to thank you for the
opportunity of being part of the team.
Rudy, I never thought
I'd be saying this...
...but it's been a pleasure.
Now what can I do for you?
Well, one of the many things
that I've learned this year...
...is that no matter how hard I try, I'm
never gonna get above the prep team.
I've kind of accepted that God made
certain people to be football players...
...and I'm not one of them.
I wish God would put your heart
in some of my players' bodies.
Yeah.
My father loves Notre Dame football
more than anything else in the world.
He doesn't believe I'm on the team...
...because he can't see me
at the sidelines during the games.
Next year, my senior year,
I'd love to be able to give him this gift:
I would really appreciate it if you could
let me dress one game next season.
Look, Rudy, the NCAA really
hamstrings us with this 60 rule.
In certain positions,
we only have one backup.
You know every year, we're competing
for the national championship.
Is this just for your father?
No. No, it's for everybody
who told me that...
...being a Notre Dame football player
would be impossible.
It's for my brothers...
...the kids in my high school,
the guys I work with at the mill.
They can't come to practice
and see that I am part of the team.
Okay.
- Okay?
- You deserve it.
You'll dress for one game next season.
Thank you, coach.
Yes!
Well, I don't know which game yet,
but it'll definitely be next season.
I'm sure.
I don't know, I guess they'll tell me
a couple of days before the game.
Look, just be ready, okay?
Thanks, Dad.
All right, bye.
V-I-C-T-O-R-Y
Victory, victory, that's our cry.
Gipper. Hey, Gipper!
Goddamn Miami law school beckons.
Miami!
I had to go.
What's wrong with you?
Look.
Ara quit?
I'll be goddamned.
Who's the new coach?
Dan Devine from the Green Bay Packers.
I'm sure Ara's gonna let him know
about his promise to let you dress.
Come on, let's take a walk.
When are you leaving?
- In about six minutes.
- Really?
The spring semester starts
in two weeks.
We've had a hell of a goddamn...
We've had a hell of a goddamn run,
haven't we, Gipper?
Yeah, we have.
You let me know when you dress.
I'm gonna fly right out for that.
There's no way I can thank you
for everything you've done.
You already have.
You remember Elza, right?
- Hi.
- Good to see you again.
She's my girl now.
She's coming with me.
- Isn't that goddamn something?
- Dennis.
What? I forgot.
I'm not allowed
to say "goddamn" no more.
What's a lapsed Catholic to do?
- We should get going.
- Yeah.
I'll see you next fall, right?
Thanks for everything.
- You take care of him.
- We're going.
- Don't I know you?
- Ruettiger!
Get your ass back out here!
Go! Go! Touchdown!
Sorry, man.
Rudy. Sorry, man.
- Just ain't right.
- No, it's not.
- Where are you going?
- I quit.
- Rudy, wait up.
- The hell with Devine, hell with Yonto!
Wait up. In two years,
you haven't missed one practice.
The last one of senior year, you quit?
- That's what I said. I quit.
- I don't want you to quit.
What the hell is it to you?
Rudy, you're one of the reasons
I stayed on this last year.
Well, I'm sorry.
You're sorry?
You're full of crap, you know that?
Everything you did and
everything you said is bullshit!
Tell Jake to make sure
the tarp's ready.
We'll check with the weather service
by 5, and we'll make a decision then.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
What you doing here?
Don't you have practice?
Not anymore. I quit.
Well, since when are you
the quitting kind?
I just don't see the point anymore.
So you didn't make the dress list.
There are greater tragedies
in the world.
I wanted to run out of
that tunnel for my dad.
- To prove to everyone...
- Prove what?
- That I was somebody.
- Oh, you are so full of crap.
You're 5 feet nothing.
A hundred and nothing.
And you've got hardly
a speck of athletic ability.
You hung in with the best college
football team in the land for two years.
And you're also gonna
walk out of here...
...with a degree from
the University of Notre Dame.
In this lifetime, you don't have to prove
nothing to nobody except yourself.
And after what you've gone through,
if you haven't done that by now...
...it ain't gonna never happen.
Now go on back.
Sorry I never got you
to see your first game in here.
Hell, I've seen too many games
in this stadium.
- You said you never saw a game.
- I've never seen one from the stands.
You were a player?
I rode the bench for two years.
Thought I wasn't being played
because of my color.
I got filled up with a lot of attitude,
so I quit.
Still not a week goes by,
I don't regret it.
And I guarantee a week won't go by
in your life...
...you won't regret walking out,
letting them get the best of you.
Now, you hear me clear enough?
Yeah.
Bill? The pitch was too soon, son.
Quick, make him commit.
Thirty-eight option, 38 option.
Let's hustle up.
It's Rudy.
Welcome back. Line up.
What the hell's going on down there?
Let's get back to work.
Sixty hit. Sixty hit.
- Ready?
- Irish!
Yeah?
Oh, hi, Roland. Come in.
I want Rudy to dress in my place,
coach.
He deserves it.
Don't be ridiculous.
Georgia Tech is one of the top
offensive teams in the country.
You're an all-American
and our captain. Act like it.
I believe I am.
Me too, coach.
I want Rudy to dress in my place.
Coach, this is for Rudy.
For Rudy, coach.
I promise. This is the real thing.
I'm gonna be on
the sidelines, in uniform.
Frank, I've never asked you
for anything in my life.
Promise me he'll be
on that bus tomorrow.
Frank, I want you to be there too.
Please.
Come on, keep up with me.
- Here you go.
- What a day for a game, huh, coach?
You bet.
- All right. Go Irish!
- Go Irish!
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
I'll get you on the way back.
I don't got my wallet on me.
This is our gate.
Hey, Rudy?
I just want you to know that
I think this is a great thing.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
It's your day.
- I wish you could be out there with me.
- I know.
This is the most beautiful sight
these eyes have ever seen.
Come on, Dad.
Huddle up.
Bring it in, guys.
Father.
Everyone, take a hand.
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou among women...
...and blessed is
the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary, mother of God...
...pray for us sinners now
and at the hour of our death. Amen.
- Notre Dame, Our Mother.
- Pray for us!
You all know what you have to do.
Remember, no one...
...and I mean no one...
...comes into our house
and pushes us around.
This is your game now, gentlemen.
And for you seniors, it's your
last one, so make it count...
...because you will remember it
for the rest of your lives.
- Let's get them.
- Yeah!
Rudy.
You ready, champ?
I've been ready
for this my whole life.
Then you take us out on the field.
- Let's go.
- Come on, Rudy. Come on, now.
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Fighting Irish, Notre Dame.
All right, let's go.
Here they go!
- That's him, 45.
- Okay, 45. You see him?
Forty-five! Forty-five!
That's him! I know him!
That's Rudy!
All right, you guys
already know this...
...but this is the most important
game of your lives.
No excuses. Do the work.
- Our Lady of Victory!
- Pray for us!
What the hell?
They're flying across the line.
Watch that number 70.
He's waltzing with him.
Forty yards
for a Notre Dame touchdown.
Fourth quarter,
with only three minutes to play...
...and the issue still in doubt.
As Barrett fades back to pass...
...for Georgia Tech
from his own 30-yard line.
Looks upfield and throws.
Intercepted by Roland Steele.
He has a convoy of blockers
down the sidelines.
Steele going in unmolested...
...standing up,
for a Notre Dame touchdown.
It's a backbreaker for Georgia Tech.
- Joe, play all the seniors!
- What about Rudy?
- Come on. Let him in for one play.
- Absolutely not.
Coach, you gotta play him.
You gotta play him, coach.
Come on, coach. One play.
Give him a chance, coach.
Notre Dame all over the ball.
Thompson recovers for the Irish.
All right!
- Go Irish!
- Rudy.
Rudy. Rudy.
Rudy. Rudy. Rudy.
Rudy! Rudy! Rudy!
Thirty-seven seconds remaining and
it'll be all over here at Notre Dame.
Off to our left...
...I'm starting to pick up the chant
from the Notre Dame student body.
Can't quite make out just what it is
at the moment.
In any event, Dan Devine's
gonna empty his bench...
...with just little time
remaining in the ball game.
One of the ballplayers going
into the game is Jamie O'Hare.
You may recall that O'Hare
was heavily recruited...
...throughout the country
several years ago.
He came to Notre Dame...
...and it's safe to say that his career
has been a disappointment.
Rudy! Rudy!
Rudy! Rudy! Rudy!
- Rudy! Rudy! Rudy!
- Listen. They're chanting for Rudy.
Rudy! Rudy! Rudy!
Kill the clock.
Do it and go into a "V."
Rudy! Rudy! Rudy!
Let's go. Listen up.
Victory formation.
The hell with Devine, Billy.
Long as offense is out here
Rudy can't play.
- We gotta run the play.
- No, we gotta score now.
- Come on. Let's get a score for Rudy.
- Yeah, it's the last game.
All right, this one's yours.
All right, pro right.
Thirty-eight halfback pass on one.
On one. Ready?
Rudy! Rudy! Rudy!
Rudy! Rudy!
Rudy! Rudy! Rudy!
What the hell is he doing?
Yeah!
Thirty-five yards for the touchdown.
Notre Dame, 23. Georgia Tech, 3.
That was for you.
What was that?
Who called that play?
I tell you,
it's just occurred to me...
...what the student body has been
chanting the last two minutes.
It's the name "Rudy."
Dan Ruettiger, a walk-on senior...
...and subject of a feature article...
...in yesterday's
student newspaper, The Observer.
- After toiling for two years...
- All right, go get them, kid.
Go, Rudy! Go, Rudy!
He's so little!
Come on. One more play.
What do I do?
Stay on. Stay there.
Rudy! Rudy! Rudy!
That's it. All right!
Yeah! Who's the wild man now!
- That's it. You were right.
- Yes! Yes! Yes!
- Rudy!
- Go, Rudy!
