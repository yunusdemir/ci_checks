Take it easy
You don't fucking know.
Just calm down, were not helping
anything by loosing our temper.
Lets just get our heads together.
Ok
Whatever we associate in our nervous
system determines our behavior.
You Fucking guys. You Fucking guys.
You Fucking guys, You Fucking guys
Lets just take a second
to review our situation,
and review our options.
We call the police
Ok, call the police
that good that one option
it's not an option,
this is not multiple choice
Yes it is
there are always options Adam
You fucking guys
We can defiantly call the police,
that's an easy call.
Now If we call the police
what happens?
They come up here, they find
a dead prosituite in the bathroom
and then they ask us what happened?
What the hell
are you going to tell them?
The you had nothing.
With it
You didn't know she was a prostitute
I mean, there was all Micheal here
your bro by the way
You don't mess around
with the homicide police.
For gods What about the alcohol
Don't tell me there are no options.
There are always fucking options
What is the choice what
are you talking about,
what are the options?
Bury her out in the desert
No sir.
Why not?
No he's right,
no he's right, he's right
We can take her up to red rock
find some nice quite place
and put her in the ground
we can do this,
We can get her out of here.
Have you lost your fucking mind?
Nobody know she's here
I call her personally, nobody knows
Her blood is all over the bathroom,
don't you think we got
a little bit of a DN A problem here?
It's a marble floor,
we can clean it up.
They got us on excitatory to Adam

This is a major
thin ice sustain here boys,
I'm getting married guys,

I've got a wife
and I've got two boys.
So don't tell me.
Lets just take a simple vote
we got two choices.
One we clean this mess up.
Right now,
bury it out in the desert,
go home and never look back,
or we can easily call the police,
roll the dice take our chances
and pray to god that
it's only Michael's faults
Choices are simple.
It's dessert or police
Dessert
fucking dessert
I owe you bro., I owe you man.
Desert.
Nobody knows she's here
How do we get her out of here?
We can wrap her up in blankets, ha
bring the car around
to the back of the hotel
lower her gently down off balcony
put her in the car, were done
Jesus Christ,
have you done this before?
The reality is if you take away
the horror of the situation
take away Tragedy of the death,
take away the moral
and ethical implications
and all the crap
you've had conditioned
and beaten into your head
sense grade one.
What are we left with? What?
It's a hundred and 5 pound problem
a hundred and 5 pounds
it's gotta be moved

distance between two points
Organize the laundry

I just want to explain
Can I talk to you
for just one second.
Please Don't go in there yet.
We were calling 911

Bingo.
New plan not so much of a new plan
rather a modification
on the old one
I'm calling the police
So help me god
you touch that fucking phone
I'll bury you with them.
Surrender is no longer an option,
I repeat it is not an option.
Is there anyone here
that doesn't under stand that.
A little gut check time fellas.
Time for a serious
self evaporation.
How do I function
For real, no more bullshit,
I keep my cool
when they bounce my bananas
when they won't play my song
Exceturize...
Do you get me?
Not really.
That's not a problem. Understand?
Not my words just follow my orders.
Follow my orders.
Let me be you success coach.
Wait, wait a minuet.
Wait wait We can't do this.
We already done this
No I mean the suitcases.
We can't bury them like this
in the suitcases
Why not?
Because It's sacrilegious
How do you figure?
According to Jewish law
the blood and the limbs
are considerd to be sacred
part of the human sprit.
The body has to be united
or the the soul can't rest in peace.
What the hell!
That's what were doing.
No no it's not.
We've got their part
all mixed together.
We can't do this to them
She Asian,
they don't have Jews in Asia
That is absolutely not true Michael
Do they have Jews in Asia
Hun?
Yes.
Yes they do
They have Jews in Asia.
That is correct
What the fuck
are we supposed to do?
We're going to
open up the suitcases
and unpack the bodies
and reunite
the appropriate body parts
No fucking way.
That's what we have to do
No fucking way
We have to do this god dame it
We got to get going
the sun's coming up come on!
I am not flexible on this.
Lets do it
I got her head. This is her head.
I got a combo situation.
You got any of him
I have a it her,
Alright I got a arm
Just open the fucking bag up
Heads up.
Jesus Christ.
Don't just toss it around
Show a little respect
I've got her lower leg
and his upper leg.
Ok. I got his upper leg.
Her lower leg I got his upper leg.
Her lower leg
and they don't go togather
Ok, how do we get started?
(Not clear)
Hold one, is this her stuff here?
Alright, just do this
one find his torso
and her torso.
(not clear)
Toes, I have toes
I have somebody's toes.
Ok?
Allow me to be the first to say that
what we've done here today
is not a good thing.
It is clearly not a good thing
But it was, given the circumstance
the smart play.
I am proud of us. I am proud of
each and everyone of us.
It will be ok.
We performed under the most complex
and earth-shattering situation
Each one of us stood fast.
We all delivered...
We're proud.
Were going to hell, hell or prison,
which everyone comes first.
That wrong, that flat out wrong.
Adam you need to change
your associations
hell is for cowards and hypocrites.
For people who fear to live be the
strength of their own conviction.
Now this is war.
Given the circumstances
or given the fact that we are alive
and they are not
we won't chosen life what it is
We're too wrong to make a right
zork conviction and excution
but it only mean more deaths here not less
All I don't know Boy,
it seems to me that ever sense
you started this personal growth,
self help power
fucking dysfunctional,
fucking bull shit
you are all fucked up in the head.
Don't even go there,
you don't know what the hell
you talking alright.
Personal strength has nothing to do
with this.
True its helped me
to unlocked energies
and see my options more clearly
but to give them credit for
all of this
is a little bit more than they deserve
Don't you think we should say
some words over the bodies
Like what
Prayer
Go ahead
Dear god.
I don't fucking know how to pray.
Say what's on your mind.
Speak from the heart, let it flow.
Dear god
This is pathetic
Your pathetic
What did you say?
Your not a team player.
Don't point at me.
You've never been a team player.
That why
you don't have any friends.
What are you talking about?
I have friends.
The hell you do
The hell I don't
You have a quintessence,
business friends,
superficial golf buddies.
You always been a fringe player
Don't point at me.
You have some serious male
on male intimacy problems.
What the fucking
are you talking about?
You can't deal with men.
Guys.
Maybe this is not the time for this
No Fisher.
This is the perfect time for this.
This is real time
were in the moment.
Adam, your brother and myself
as well as several others present
always felt that
you were fully repressed living
in major denial lockdown fly boy.
What?
Fire in the hole big guy!
What?
Dear God. Please forgive us
for what we have done here tonight.
We have lost our way.
Speaking for my self,
I am deeply in love with the woman
I am about to marry.
I am very much looking forward
to raising a family
and being
a positive member of society.
We promise if you forgive us
that we will never
forget this tragedy
I will try with all our power
use this daily reminder
that we're on this earth to do good
not evil
Let us move from this day forward
for a new spirit in purpose
You're giving us a second chance
let's take that second chance
and use it to fuel
our fire of productivity
so the spirit of some of
the two people that we bury here
I can forever live on
in our good deeds and
positive achivements
that we from this day
forward shall make our lives work
Thank you god once again
Give us your guide and forgiveness
Amen

If you're really good,

I promise.
Whizzers! We want Whizzers!
Okay
We want Whizzers!
All right.
We want Whizzers!
Whizzers! Whizzers! Whizzers!
We want Whizzers!
Hey, how do you like your mini-van?
So, how do you like your mini-van?
Fine
Honey, honey,

What?
They're screaming for Whizzers.
Just go in there
and get some Whizzers.
I'm not going in there.
They're screaming like monsters.
It's giving me a headache.
I used the credit card
so I didn't have to go in there.
Would you just please

Whizzers! Whizzers! Whizzers!
Thank you, go.
Please? Whizzers.
Love you.
Fuckin' Whizzers!
Excuse me.
Oh, yeah, sure. No problem.
I'm sorry, I got it. Sorry!
Just leave it.
Leave it and get out.
I'm sorry
Buddy, are you ok?
What the hell is wrong with you?
Just get out.
Where are the Whizzers?
They didn't have any Whizzers.
What do you mean
they didn't have any Whizzers?
They didn't have
any fuckin' Whizzers, ok!
What are you doing?
What is your problem?
Dad!
Nice to see you.
You look so beautiful.
I love that dress.
Oh my God, have you seen Amanda?
Oh my God, come here.
Hi, how's it going?
Nice to see you.
I feel like there's a fuckin' monkey
kickin' inside of my...
I know, I get you.
Hi, nice to see you.
Hi, Mr. & Mrs. Will.
Where's the bathroom?
Where's the fuckin' bathroom!
Right across the bar!
Excuse me.
Here's a picture of Kyle, age 4,
and his good friend Jo Jo the Mule.
Now, evidently,
when they got to camp...
Kyle and Boyd over there,
had some serious serious arguments
About who exactly
was Kyle's best friend.
Boyd or the mule.
Well, Fish had a less than normal
relationship with that ass.
You're just jealous Boyd.
That is, if may,
after camp came football.
And for those of you who didn't
follow the sports pages back in 1977.
You might not remember that
Pee Wee Powerhouse Oklahoma,
Two of the brilliant leadership
of yours truly managed to roll
To an auspicious league record
of all for 12.
Scoring exactly
not one damn touchdown.
Here's Kyle without his jersey.
Where are you going?
As you can see,
he was a husky kid then...
And he's a husky kid now.
His great talent was persistance.
They showed up.
He didn't score much,
he didn't score at all.
But they showed up.
I'd like to propose my toast
to the groom and his wonderful bride.
God bless.
Adam.
I can't... I can't fuckin' breath.
What's wrong?
I'm sorry.
You're freaking me out, bud.
Ok, that was definitely not cool,
definitely inappropriate behavior.
Just shut up for a second.
Negative!
This is not what we've worked out
in terms of self-management here.
Adam, come on! Pull it together.
What's the problem, Adam?
What is the fuckin' problem, huh?
Come on.
I can't do this.
We're gonna get busted.
We're not gonna get busted.
Who, what?
At the mini-market.
What the hell are you talking about?
They're smokin' me out.
Who's smokin' you out?
Nobody is smokin' you out.
Shut up!
Kyle!
Yeah, what, hon?
Honey! Honey?
Yeah.
Is everything ok?
Yeah, everything's fine, great.
Ok, can we go back inside?
Yeah, sure.
Honey, now!
Now, can we go inside?
But I just have this...
we have to... we gotta...
Last minute preparations to make.
Dad, everything's fine, ok?
I'm in the middle of my
goddamn toasting in there.
Listen, why don't the two of you
go back inside...
You get back into the toast
and I'll be back in.
So just go on, please.
Honey, we have rehersals,
dinner here, ok?
And your wife looks beautiful,
except what you did to her fuckin' nose.
Adam, the timing fuckin'sucks!
You have to pull it together,
right now.
I don't give a goddamn.
You never gave a damn
about anyone but yourself.
Well, you're a little fuckin' reject.
Well, you eat my ass.
Eat my ass!
Don't ever touch my mini-van again
Or you are going to be
very sorry brother.
Very fuckin' sorry!
You are a loser!
Loser?
Loser. You're a loser.
You think your shit's
so fuckin' righteous?
You were right there, boy
right there with us.
Side by fuckin' side.
You murdered that girl!
You murdered her.
You're a murderer! Murderer!
Shut your fuckin'mouth!
Shut your fucking'mouth!
I didn't do anything, ok?
I'm just gonna turn
your pathetic little ass in...
How about that, pal?
Did you hear that?
I heard that.
Adam, calm down.
I'm not going to calm down.
I can't do this, I'm telling you.
It won't work, it can not work!
It has worked.
It is working.
They've got fiberoptics.
They've got FBIs, scientists.
The fuckin' Internet, goddamn it!
They figured the shit out.
They figure out every fuckin' time.
They won't figure it out.
You just got to relax.
I got children. I've got a life.
Your kid's one crush away
from a telethon.
You've got a fridges swamp
of a hot wife.
You fuckin' bastard!
Jesus! What is...
Are they fighting?
No, baby, let's just go back inside.
They are fighting over there.
Now what the fuck is...
Back off, Michael. That's enough.
Back off!
You will not ruin it for us.
This has got to stop.
Come on.
You fuckin'go home.
You fuckin'murderer!
Back off!
You're a fuckin'loser!
Cool it!
You're a loser!
You need to take a time-out.
Come on.
Don't go, you fuckin' murderer!
A loser!
Go home, you fuckin' murderer!
Easy, easy. We gotta go back in.
The problem is gone, ok?
Time out.
We got to get in there.
Listen, we're gonna go back inside.
We're gonna collect ourselves.
Adam, are you cool?
No, Boyd, no.
I am definitely not cool!
All right,
problem child is leaving.
Get the fuck out of here!
Pull it together.
I've got my whole
fuckin' family in there.
What do you want?
Mr. Fuckin' mini-van.
Just get the hell out of here, Mike.
He's gonna take out my mini-van!
Don't you dare! Michael!
Christ!
So it was some sort of accident.
Yeah, he didn't realize it.
He just wanted to move the cars.
Was there some sort of argument?
No, nothing like that.
We heard there were
some arguing going on...
What, some kind of
sibling muscle-flex thing?
No, they love each other.
It's just... we were just ouside...
just talking.
We were just talking.
What were you talking about?
Wedding...
Marriage, wedding...
Hell, it's probably the last time
for all of us to be together.
Before he gets married.
A lot of people seem to think
there were some hostility.
What the fuck
am I suppose to comment...
On what a lot of
other people thought, huh?
Listen, we've all suffered
an incredible trauma here...
And we're in full-on grieving mode now.
And your questions
are just a little bit poorly timed...
Do you understand?
Thank you very much, Officer...
Randone.
All right, easy boy.
Nah, don't easy boy,
don't give me that shit.
Our friend in there is in pieces,
for God's sakes!
How about a little sensitivity, huh?
Oh, there was no fighting going on
or nothin'.
What was that guy's name?
Robert Boyd.
Excuse me,
his situation is critical.
He's asking to speak to his wife.
Yes?
It's bad, I just want to warn you.
You're gonna have to stay away,
'mam.
All clear.
Nothing.
Clear.
I've got nothin'.
I'm gonna call it.
Time of death, 11:58pm.
Whay did he say?
I'm sorry, he's dead.
What are you walkin' away for?
I need to know it's clear.
What did Adam tell Lowes?
That's the name of the game.
What did Adam tell Lowes?
What does Lowes know?
I killed my brother.
I killed my brother.
I killed my brother.
All right.
I ran my brother down in cold blood.
I ran him down. I killed him.
Come on, Michael.
I killed my brother.
I killed my brother.
It's time to pay the rent!
It's time to pay!
It's time to pay!
Take it easy.
Listen to me.
Easy, easy!
You kill one man
and you're a murderer, ok?
You kill all and you are God.
Ok, take it easy.
I killed my bro...
You mother fucker!
In the name
of the wicked shall rise!
Get the car!
Get off me! Get off me!
Just pick him up
and get him in the car.
Keep your voice down, Michael.
Open the door.
Get in the car.
Get in there. Come on!
Michael! Michael!
You will control
your conditioned response!
You will pull yourself together,
mister.
All right!
Are you hearing me?
Yes!
Jesus!
He's cracking up.
I'm not cracking up.
(He's not cracking up.)
What have we done?
What did you ask me?
I said, what have we done?
Yes you did.
Now that is the question.
That is exactly the question
we should be asking ourselves.
What have we done?
Why don't you tell us, Fisher?
What have we done?
I just want to get married.
Exactly! Exactly my point!
What's your fuckin' point?
I'm not talking to you, Moor.
What's your point!
What's your point!
You want to know
what you're doing here?
You are love-pumpin'.
You are protecting all that is sacred
and beautiful...
And in sync with poetry and sunsets
and little new born babies.
You're walking the walk.
This is it, Fisher.
The real stuff. You love this woman.
And nothing, absolutely nothing,
superceeds love, man! Nothing!
I love you, I love Moor,
I love Michael.
This car is full of love!
But trust me,
you're gonna do whatever it takes.
Whatever it takes.
Love does not lose.
Michael.
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
It's not your fault,
it's not your fault.
I'll get you a new mini-van.
Michael, watch the nose, the nose.
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
Cancel. Cancel?
You're out of your fuckin' mind.
Nobody is talking about caneling.
I'm just talking about modifying.
No way. No way.
Can we just talk it through?
Talk what through?
Look it, we are locked
in loading here, right?
I mean, we are not refundable.
I have family at the airport
as we speak...
Getting ready to come here
to see us get married.
Do you understand?
I have got a table
full of cousins out there.
Just answer it.
Hello?
Kyle, it's Lowes.
I was up at Adam's study
and I found a note...
It seems to be
some sort of confession...
About some horrible thing he did
to a woman in Las Vegas.
I want to know
what the hell is going on.
I'm starting to freak out.
We're goosed.
We're not goosed.
What's your disposition?
Regarding what?
Did she sound pissed, scared,
hostile?
Did she say anything about
calling the police?
No, but she's definitely
pissed and hostile.
And she's clearly starting to think
that somethin's not right.
We're goosed, goosed by God.
Michael, will you please calm down,
all right?
What did you tell her?
I told her I had no idea what Adam
was talking about in that letter.
Well, did she believe you?
I have no idea.
You can tell when people believe you.
It's obvious.
I don't have that skill.
But if I had to guess...
I would say that
she'd no way believe me.
Goosed.
Shut up!
Goosed!
Stop it.
Goosed!
What's goosed?
Would you give him another pill?
He's already had two.
Well, give him two more.
We are goosed.
Open sesame.
Jesus, Boyd, you're gonna OD him.
Suck my ass!
Goosed!
I'd never liked you, Boyd.
You're a sneaky little fuck,
always have been.
What are you talking about?
Oh, don't sweet lip me.
I don't understand where
this personal attack is coming from.
You're a liar!
I want to know
what happend in Vegas.
Nothing happend in Vegas.
Well, I don't want to hear it
from the liar!
So just stick a plug in it, Boyd.
Fisher, what happend in Vegas?
Nothing happend in Vegas.
Moor.
Nothing happend, Lowes.
Michael?
Do you have someting to tell me?
Michael,
just tell Lowes nothing happened.
Shut up, Boyd. Shut up.
Michael. Michael.
Goosed.
What?
Lowes, we were bad.
We were very very...
We were very very bad.
He's just a little upset about Adam
We're all very upset.
Michael, Michael, Michael.
What did you do?
Nothing. Nothing happend in Vegas.
All right, I'll call the police.
I will call the police right now
if I don't start getting some answers.
Lowes, please,
please calm down, Lowes.
Fuck you, Boyd.
Just take it easy, ok?
Enough with this.
Nothing happend, Lowes.
Nothing happend.
Nothing happend? Nothing happend.
Nothing happend. Nothing happend.
I am going to count to five
and I'll call the police...
And then
we'll find out what happend.
One...
Goosed!
Two...
Please don't make this situation...
Three...
anymore tense than it has to be...
Four...
Just relax, would you?
I'm calling the fuckin' police.
Ok, here's the deal!
Adam slept with
a prostitute in Vegas.
He was sick with guilt.
No...
That's true.
It wasn't the first time.
Adam had a...
Adam had a thing for prostitutes.
My Adam?
My Adam? No, I don't believe this.
I don't believe this.
This is not true.
Not my Adam. No.
I'm sorry.
You're lying.
You're a whole bunch of liars.
I don't believe you.
All right, watch your fingers,
watch your toes.
All right, fellas,
I want you to listen to me.
Now, mommy's gonna take
a little time-out.
And Bunker's gonna keep
you guys company.
And everything's gonna be ok,
I promise. Ok?
Ok.
Take my cell phone.
After you drop the kids off,
take Michael home...
Put a couple of drinks in him,
so he'll sleep.
I don't think that's a good idea.
Just do it. I'll call you later.
But what are you doing?
I'm gonna take care of business.
What does that mean?
What does that mean?
Are you insane?
You actually think
I would hurt Lowes?
She's the mother of these kids,
for Christ's sakes.
What's wrong with you?
You got a real nasty side...
Your though process.
All right, I'm sorry.
It's just for tonight.
Lowes is a mess.
Michael is upset. Everybody's upset.
Shut up!
Ok, I am not canceling this wedding.
I don't want you to.
I won't even discuss this.
Nobody's discussing it, ok?
I'm just gonna bring Michael home
and I'm gonna come right back here.
You have to pick up the cake
in the morning early.
Don't we have somebody
to do that for us?
Yeah, you.
What the...
Ok, ok.
Ah, Jesus fuckin' Christ.
Evil bastard.
You hear the buzzing, Fish?
Buzzing?
Yeah, like a... fuckin' chirping
in the back of my skull.
I don't hear anything.
Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem.
Didi, Didi, boom, bing bing bing
bam bam bam.
Dad used to bring home sparklers
for me and Adam, you know?
Sparklers. We'd go back,
the three of us...
And we'd hold it up to the sky...
And watch the explosions of
light and the sparks, you know.
And dad would be all,
"Wait for it, here it comes.
Watch for it. Ok, here comes,
here comes the Wahu."
Wahu?
Wahu.
The spark would burn hot,
then hotter, then even hotter.
Then there'd be this one moment of
pure burn...
Where that little fucker
would caught perfect, just perfect.
It would only last a second,
but that second was it. It was it.
And that's what dad
had us looking for, man!
Are you with me?
Wahu moment?
That's exactly right.
That's what I'm driving at.
Man, burning at its absolute.
All the forces coming together,
Burning just perfect,
perfect harmony.
That's what I'm driving at.
Are you with me?
I think so.
I've been looking for that flash.
I've been looking
and I've been looking...
And I can't find it.
And what if it had already happened,
you know? My moment.
What if it happened
and I didn't even see it?
Lowes? Lowes?
Adam.
No, it's Boyd.
I just wanted you to know...
Just how much I did not appreciate
that personal attack.
I'm really offended.
You picked the wrong woman,
mother fucker.
It's over baby.
I'm gonna turn myself in.
No.
After the wedding, of course,
after the wedding, out of respect.
I don't think that's a good idea.
No, no, no. You don't understand.
Out of respect for Fisher.
Ok, respect for you. Listen to me,
listen to me.
Respect for you, respect for your wife
and your wedding, ok?
All right,
do you hear what I have here?
There will be no more...
I appreciate it.
You're being too hard on yourself.
No, no, no.
No, this is my doing, ok?
I'm gonna have my Wahu spark
of my own, all right?
Jesus.
I'm gonna do this for Lowes...
And for my brother...
And for the kids.
I'm gonna turn myself in
'cos I'm all that.
What is it?
I just listened.
If you think about names,
you know, babies.
Michael's a pretty good one.
Just tell me you're all right.
Fish? Fish.
Hello?
Ok, here's the deal.
That's a good one.
Lowes is cool.
It's a pacified situation.
Wow, wait, wait.
What do you mean?
She's resting, she's comfortable.
The only thing is,
you still got Michael there, right?
Right?
Yeah.
Ok, great.
She wants to see him in person.
She... she needs to grieve
with her family.
It's a little family time.
Right now?
Yeah.
Well, isn't it a little late?
Get over here
and don't be so goddamn selfish.
Ok, you guys wait in the car.
I'm gonna take him in.
She just wants to see him alone.
Lowes wants to see me?
Here we go, big guy.
She does? Ok.
Upsy Daisy.
A big hug, a big family hug.
Come on.
One foot before the other.
There you go.
I'm gonna let you do this and then
we're gonna go to Fat Burger.
Ok, big guy.
I'm thinking about
maybe making a move.
A move?
Yeah, a Green Peace.
Green Peace?
Yup, yup, yup.
Maybe go up to
the North Pole, the Arctic.
Take polar bears with dart guns.
I've always got pretty good aim.
Michael was in love with Lowes.
That's what Michael and Adam
are arguing about in the parking lot.
Michael killed Adam
in a jealous rage.
Lowes rejected Michael.
He strangled her to death.
They shot themselves in the head.
It happens all the time.
That Lowes,
she fought like a fuckin'...
I don't see how this
could have be kept from him.
Last month, Adam and Lowes
changed their will.
They requested that you two,
as married couple,
Be custodian to, for record,
for their estate,
Including all properties,
cash holdings, security holdings,
And children.
Adam had a $500,000 term
life insurance policy.
What does that mean?
It means that we have $500,000
to help raise the kids.
No.
Yes.
No!
Yes.
Actually, no.
Adam failed to make his last payments.
So, his term life lapsed.
But he did have a pension account
worth $150,000...
And the house, valued at $350,000.
Ok, so where does that leave us?
150, 350, that's...
takes us back to $500,000.
Not even close.
Property value is down.
The house is worth $100,000 less.
Three credit cards, the mini-van payments,
And the incoming estate taxes
assessed on his IRA.
It's in the neighborhood of $14,223.
Are you fuckin' kidding me?
You little asshole!
What are you gonna do?
Come and hurt me.
Come on, enough, enough.
So, when is the wedding?
Fall.
We're getting married tomorrow.
Excuse me for a moment.
Enough!
It's going to be ok.
It's not ok. It's not ok.
It's not ok.
We're gonna be fine.
We have to cancel.
No, no we don't. No we don't.
It's gonna be ok, honey.
It's going to be ok.
Do you love me?
Kyle, it's gonna be ok.
We killed a woman.
What are you taling about?
In Vegas, Michael killed a woman.
Michael killed her.
He hit her head and...
And she bled, and she... she died.
But there was nothing we could do
about it, so we buried...
Who's dead?
The prostitue's dead.
You fucked a prostitute?
No, Michael did.
It was an acc... Michael did.
Where is she?
She's buried in the desert.
You left a dead prostitute
alone in the desert?
She's not alone.
Boyd went crazy.
He started to kill everybody.
He killed Nicole, he killed Michael,
He killed the horse...
Stop, ok? Just stop right there.
I don't want to hear
any more of this, ok?
I don't you not to do that stupid
fuckin' bachelor party thing, ok?
I know.
You were warned.
I know.
You were warned, Kyle.
You were warned.
I told you your friends were just
jack asses.
I know and I'm sorry.
I've waited 27 years, ok?
27 years I have focused and prepared
to walk down that aisle.
And I will not be derailed,
I will not be embarrassed.
And I will not be denied.
So tomorrow I am walking
down that aisle compelled,
On high fuckin' water.
Ok, showtime. About two minutes out.
Chop, chop.
Let me see ya.
You look great, man.
Go get them.
This is a situation
that devies judgment.
Now we have acted and shown courage
of a nature not known by most.
You got a warped thought process.
Your brain doesn't fuction properly.
Whatever you say, Kojak.
I'm serious.
No, no, no,
I'm the serious one here, ok?
I'm the serious one.
I'm the guy making the fuckin' blaze.
I'm the Indian runner
for Christ's sakes.
And I want my money.
What money?
My money!
Insurance dollars which you have
thus far...
Somehow let it slip your mind
to tell me about.
You're sick.
If you think you can fuck me, Fish,
you can't, ok?
I'm backed up. I'm insolated, baby.
Backed up on floppy, you get me?
I want that fuckin' money.
Oh God I can taste it.
Not a prayer.
I'm the fuckin' lighthouse, man.
I stayed lit for you.
I stayed lit! I never go dark.
Never go dark!
You need help.
I want that fuckin' money!
I told Boyd two fuckin' minutes.
I want my money.
You idiot, trying to cheat me?
You goddamn bastard.
Boyd! This is my day!
Honey, wait.
Ok, stick him in the crapper
and get your ass upstairs.
Baby?
The best man's going to make it.
We're gonna just start, ok?
Sure.
Great. Great.
Where's Boyd?
In the toilet.
We're gonna get started, ok?
Dearly beloved,
we are all here today.
Because two very special people,
Laura and Kyle have found each other.
When I see two young people in love
as they are,
I find myself renewed and inspired
because the spirit...
With hope for the future and joy.
Let's begin.
May we have the rings please.
I'm on my way.
The rings, we need the rings.
I don't have the rings.
I have the ring.
Where is the ring?
Excuse me.
Oh God.
Oh God.
Where's the rings?
Jesus Christ!
Got them.
Now we can begin.
Do you Kyle, take this woman Laura
to be your wife and help mate...
In sickness and in health,
along life's highways,
Wherever they may take you,
until death do you part?
I do.
And do you Laura, take this man Kyle...
I do.
You may kiss the bride.
Guys, listen, I need two minutes.
All right?
Just tell Ricky I'd be right out.
Baby, I just want you to know that
all, all this,
Everything I did is 'cos I love you...
And I wanted you to have that wedding
like you always wanted to have, ok?
You and Moor are gonna go find
those bodies, do you understand me?
And you're gonna
bury Boyd with them.
And in fact, you know what?
You're gonna fuckin' put Moor
in the ground too.
You want me to kill Moor?
I know he's
your only friend left, ok?
But he is a loose string.
And you are gonna have to fuckin'
start flushing the toilet...
Like a big boy,
do you understand me?
Laura.
Fuck!
You guys, listen,
two minutes please.
Just make my apologies for me.
Do your job.
And while yo're at it, you know.
Just get rid of that fuckin' dog.
The dog?
I don't care what you do.
Get rid of them.
Loose them in the desert.
You want me to kill the dog?
Do you love me?
Yes.
Do you?
Do you love me?
Do you love me.
Do you?
Laura.
I told you two fucking minutes!
I've been thinking...
I've been thinking about
what you said that day, the prayer.
And about using this whole mess
to bring out the good in me.
I think there's
a lot of truth in that.
I wanna, I wanna join that
Big Brother thing...
Yeah?
Yeah.
I want a black one.
I want a little Black brother.
That's a big problem to me,
you know?
Like racial integration.
That's a big one.
Don't you think? Kyle?
Do you love me?
That ought to be about
the end to that.
Yup.
Because that is the point here, ok?
That's is what I'm driving for.
The point where the big storm comes
and knocks down all the forrest...
And all the rocks fall down,
and all the leaves are bare.
Waht is left?
What is left?
The little trees, the little fellas
that the storm didn't see.
Ok, boys,
let's hear the badger oath.
A badger is great.
A badger faces great diversity...
A badger is economical,
safely unforeseen.
A badger...
keeps his mind and body pure.
Yes, yes. Come on,
let's hear your badger salute.
Ah, no.
Come on, let's see the badger salute.
To hell with it.
Come on, give me your hand.
I don't need help.
If you don't reach out to me
I can't help you.
Come on, come on Adam,
we're gonna make it.
Get your own crutch, stub boy.
I can't breath, asshole.
A little help please.
Let go of me, you gib.
A little help?
Honey, can you help me
with the wheelchair?
Honey, I need some help.
That's ok.
Help me, honey.
Want to talk about us?
