Then... I wake up.
And that's all?
You're just you? No one else?
Yes. Just me.
- It's my fault?
- What?
I do not know...
You're single, you can not escape...
It's because of our relationship?
I make you feel trapped?
Not.
I know we wanted this

This castle?
Who receives everything and wants?

It's just a dream, nothing more.

What you know about Rekall?
- Crap what you change your mind?
- Yes.
Do-Thi good

- Why?
- I know Travis May of the third round?
Rekall was in the bachelor party.
- Wanted to be king on Mars.
- I would like to go to Mars.
S has got a lobotomy.
- And I think those stories tile?
- About Rekall? Yes, I think.
Come on!
- Do not you ever thought that?
- No need to think about.
It plays with your mind, man!
Not worth.
- Okay, listen!
- Might want to play with my mind.
- And start double shifts.
- No!
Do not give to blame me. No
I do not want to stay here longer.
Androids have increased production of crap because of this morning,
So I ask your complaint to the Chancellor Cohaagen
.
Now that mules are made to instruct
new guy?
Not me...
N keeps it like that! Hold it away.
If a ferent and there is short circuit,
a-Thi to THA and NEASC a screw directly by hand

- It's no play, right?
- I.
There are simpler methods to get a day off.
Thanks!
By the way, your friend is wrong and you...
In connection with Rekall.
- Have you tried?
- Already three times.
Really?
I have the best memories.
Much better than this shit.
Ask the Mac, right?
Thank you to me and you.
<i> Douglas Quaid is asked to appear at the head of production. </ I></i>
- Any news?
- Right now I know.
Come on, keeps me on fire.
Will use someone outside the factory.
Look, as I look at me,

they bring.
So what's the problem?
I worked on broken in the last quarter.
We stayed overtime
I exceeded the norm.
You know how it works.
You're in the Colony, he of the FUB.
He has a good education
and necessary cells.
Good...
What are you saying? If there are
on the assembly line, one to go crazy!
I am so sorry, Doug.
- I did everything I could.
- Right.
Thanks for trying.
<i> I had a busy day.
I went to bed early. Sweet dreams </ i></i>
- Finally! Cheers!
- Cheers!
- Hello, pal!
- Hello!
- How do you feel?
- I had days and better.
- Lori working tonight?
- Yes?
Murry, give me and him drinking.
You have learned to Cantha the piano?
I always I wanted to learn.
- What's with you today?
- What?
It's all about promotion, all day
of mind was elsewhere.
- I've had a dream...
- Have you dreamed?
Yes... I feel I do something.
Something... something that matters,
something important, you know?
No, not really.
Do you think we're doing is not important?
Really? Come on, Harry!
Drive through half the world for a job sucks.
For the wages of shit and come to this bar sucks
and drunk our beer sucks.
- No offense, Murry.
- No bathrooms.
You're just happy
the life that you have?
- There's something wrong with it?
- No, you're right, forget it.
I... Forget it.
Well, huge rad, see you tomorrow!
- Want my advice?
- Say it.
You to solve problems that go,
prior to THI make cabbage head.
It is possible to be drinking too much.
Yes, it is possible, Harry.
- I'm going to vomit.
- Good.
And you're going to put things right thi...
- And I'll go home. Have you heard?
- I think everyone heard you, Harry.
- Goodnight, Dougie!
- Good Night!
You seem to seek something.

Looking Rekall. You know where he is?
That way, the "steps to heaven".
Thanks!
Welcome to Rekall!
- Is the first time Come?
- Yes.
- Is not that obvious?
- Does not matter.
Why did you have to be afraid.
It's a safe place.
My friend gave me this book
business card. She said to ask the Mac.
- Is straight forward.
- Thanks.
Do not forget you feel better!
- Welcome!
- Hello!
- Are you friends with Marek?
- Marek... Yes!
Yes... We... are co-workers.
Ls?
- That e
- And is that in true life?
Life is only what the brain perceives.
Eyes see, and chemical processes in the brain reacts
.
This removes the middleman and go directly to chemical processes.
E less real because of it?
No matter how convincing an illusion, an illusion still remains.
You're right!
Objectively speaking,
you're right.
But inside... is subjective!
Make sure it's the total opposite.
I understand, understand. You're here because I feel that-Thi
missing something.
Tanja're after something more.
1 November that we give something to-Thi.
That's how you say?
You could do something not-Thi Thi-you could afford.
Secret Something you always wanted to try,
but you never dared.
- What do you mean secret?
- Any.
Tell us your fantasy and we'll, we give Thi memory.
Do you want to be rich and famous?
Revered by millions of people?
Maybe something with more adrenaline.
Justi¡‚iar?
Or a world class athlete.
Secret Agent. Thi fits you, right?
Clandestine bank accounts,
coded messages...
A and could be a secret agent?
Yes, a secret agent.
You could work for the resistance. Or maybe Cohaagen
.
Why should I imitate?
Why not both?
One more thing, Doug.
A leveling knowledge.
Any choice you make
secret can exist in true life.
The thing is that...
There are men who come here and choose
to have a mistress, but already have one.
True one, besides that.
Can not make something like that.
Because
hopelessly confused conflict will destroy the brain.
- Do not worry, I have secrets.
- I'm sure you did.
But-Thi to do a test to make sure
.
Starts it, Markus.
<i> File with agents secretion </ i></i>
You'll have fun as well, that

Look! It seems that your wife does have
a man who appreciates.
Here there is no conflict.
Sorry. All this is the best way to introduce
chemicals in the body.
Well, here we fight!
Prepares you to save the world.
Sweet dreams, man!

A-THI seem strange to what you will say.
I went to Rekall after work.

Nothing, nothing. I put the chair,

Before they can do something,
police came.
They tried to take me.
I react suddenly...
- And I killed.
- I've killed one, Doug.
Believe me, I killed all!
Honey, do not understand?
Whatever you think you do,

Dobitocii that have played with your mind,

That's very dangerous place.
No matter what happened,

a life that you think you have lived it.
Wake up, sweetie!
There is no Douglas Quaid.
Never existed.

Do you really think that someone like me

If not me, then who the hell are

How to know me?
I just work here.
Speculate!
If you had to guess ...
After each made Cohaagen,
as to hide the resistance,
must be pretty important.
And, as you're at the ready,
I doubt you're's gardener.
Cohaagen...
If Cohaagen trying to hide...
Why try to kill me?
Talk!
Control-Thi anger, Doug.
By the way...

Registration has limited capabilities for interaction. Rephrases the question.
- Working for Matthias?
- Yes.
But I never met.
May no one met him.
I received a direct order from Cohaagen me to infiltrate the resistance
and Matthias to kill him.
Then...
I had a woman.
And I opened my eyes.
And I
have shown that resistance to fight for.
Not against resistance.
- Meaning for terrorists.
- Listen!
Most of the resistance are not terrorists.
Will equal the colony.
Will freedom.
Bombings are arranged Cohaagen FUB.
Believe me, I was commander.
I know that I can skin!
Why and would attack their own people?
Not understand.
To justify building an army of androids.
Not understand? Will invade the colony. FUB
no longer living space.
Cohaagen will eradicate the entire colony and will rebuild.
Androids will replace workers.
Innocent people will die.
But we can stop it.
- November 2.
- What can I do?
It's a way to stop all soldiers.
There is a code of destruction.
It's a long and complex sequence,
but I saw it.
It means that I still have

Matthias will know how to draw.
I have to go to him!
Is our only chance to stop the invasion.
Listen to one who knows you better than you know

This is my chance and make something good.
Millions of people rely on you.
Good luck, buddy!

- Do not tell me like that!
My name is Doug Quaid,
I was born on August 29.
I was raised by his mother, who died of cancer
ten days before you are 15 years.
- I married my girlfriend...
- You were born on April 29th!
Brought up  your father, not mother
.
He died 15 years before you do,
but in a car accident.
And, believe me, you are not married!
Nothing is logical.
All I know is that is Doug Quaid.
- I recognize the you!
- A dream.

It was a memory.
How do you think you chose that

Congratulations, my friend!
Lift it! Up!
You succeeded!

Matthias is dead, Colony will share,
and all because you too.

were some obstacles in the way.
I was beautiful what you did to Rekall.

Do you give a second chance.
What do you mean?
- No!

I made a backup copy of Hauser's
memory before sending it to the mission.
Before becoming corrupted.
Do not!
Think about it!
Within hours you will be awake and Hauser

Loyal, patriotic and without mercy.
With you what to do?
- I think you should keep.
- Leave her her alone!
I think the world is very interested in hearing confession Lieutenant
Matthias.
- Never!
- Cohaagen!
You'd be very surprised to see
Hauser knows what good to get confessions by force.
Cursed be, Cohaagen!
Have me.
Give it up! Give it up!
Melina!
