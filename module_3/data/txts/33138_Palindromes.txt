Dawn went through many phases
in her short life,
but one thing that never changed
was her love of music...
even when she was told again
and again she had no real talent.
Last night, rummaging in her closet,
I came upon this audio tape,
a recording of a piece she was preparing
for a talent contest at school.
She lost in the first round.
Personally, I think
the judges made a mistake.
<i>Mom!</i>
It's OK. It's OK, honey.
Shh, shh! Oh, oh, oh.
It's OK, it's OK, it's OK.
I don't want to be like Dawn.
I don't want to be like her,
or end up like her.
Aviva, no. Shh!
Shh, don't worry. You and Dawn
are completely different.
Really?
Your cousin was a troubled child -
a middle child.
Her parents didn't love her the way
your father and I love you.
Why not?
- I don't know.
Maybe if she hadn't grown obese.
If she'd gone to a dermatologist...
something.
Is it true she never washed her hair?
Dawn was a very special person,
with very special needs.
Oh, God!
There's so much
I'd have done for her, if only...
Missy told me after the funeral
that Dawn was pregnant
from a date rape
and that that's the real reason
she killed herself.
She hated the idea of bringing
another Dawn into the world,
and then she said
that I was just like Dawn.
You shouldn't listen to everything Missy
tells you just because she's beautiful and popular.
I know, 'cause if I were pregnant,
I would never kill myself.
That would be killing the baby.
You would talk to me first, wouldn't you?
Yes, because I want to have
lots and lots of babies.
As many babies as possible,
because...
um, because that way,
I'll always have someone to love.
Oh, honey...
I love you so much.
So I'm really not like her?
No, Aviva.
You are the cutest bundle of love
in the whole wide world.
No matter what anyone says,
you'll always be you.
My baby.
You made it!
Great!
- Hi!
Come on in, come on in! This is
the laundry room, washer, dryer. Bruce!
Great.
- Bruce, the Victors are here.
Anyway, this is it.
- How are you? Bruce.
Judah!
- I'm coming!
It only took us about 3 months.
We had to raise the ceiling.
I guess a lot of people
lived here back down.
Bruce walked around,
getting paint in his hair.
Christ, I was in the bathroom.
- OK.
Joyce, Steve-my son, Judah.
Hello.
- Hi, nice to meet you.
And this is Aviva.
- Hey.
Hey.
OK, come on. Let's all go out to the deck.
The lake is gorgeous. I'm dying for you to see it.
<i>It's so beautiful.</i>
What are you listening to?
A self-esteem lecture,
part of a series.
<i>Judah, why don't you bring Aviva
out back and show her the lake?</i>
Will you shut the fuck up!
You wanna come up?
- Oh, OK.
I'm trying to put together a feature,
it's a mix of different genres.
I'm a little worried people gonna
think it's like Jackass.
But it's not. It's nothing like it.
It's totally original.
Cool.
It's hard, though.
<i>'Cause in the beginning, nobody
believes in you, nobody wants to help.</i>
Like, it's hard just getting someone to be in it.
Nobody wants to put in the effort.
I asked my Mom, she said no.
My Dad, he's too busy.
People are unreliable.
They have no faith.
I know.
Is that you?
- Yeah.
You were so cute.
- Yeah.
Too bad you had to grow up.
Yeah, I know.
I was so happy then,
only I didn't know it.
Maybe you're happy now,
you just don't know it.
<i>Oh, yes!</i>
<i>Oh! Oh, Ron! Ron!</i>
<i>Ron Gerard!
Harder! Harder! Harder!</i>
<i>Yes! Oh... Oh, Ron!</i>
That guy...
- Yeah?
He lives across the lake. I'm gonna try and
see if he'll do a cameo in my feature.
I need a professional actor.
You know, for marketing purposes.
But it'll be family rated.
<i>Oh, touch my titties! Mmm, it feels
so good! Oh, that's right, touch them! </i>
Please take it off.
Maybe we should get
under the covers. - OK.
Do you think about sex a lot?
I don't know. I guess.
I never think about it.
I just think about having a baby.
Why?
I don't know. They're cute.
I want one.
OK, then. Are you ready?
Uh-huh.
OK. Here goes.
I thought you'd done this before.
I did. You were supposed to
move your hips more.
My... huh?
- Just forget it.
Oh. Is that it, then?
What? Do you want a tissue?
Is that what you mean?
Could you try it again,
like Ron Gerard?
Right now?
- Yeah.
I don't know.
<i>Aviva, are you OK?</i>
What?
Who did this to you?
Who the fuck did this to you?
It was that Wallace boy!
That ugly, fat little bastard!
Aviva, did he rape you?
<i>He's gonna pay!
He's gonna pay!</i>
<i>That fucking shitface!
He's gonna pay big time!</i>
What are you gonna do?
Have a talk with his parents?
You gonna fucking sue? She doesn't
need any more humiliation.
We'll find a doctor
and that'll be that.
Honey, can we talk for a bit now?
- Oh, OK.
I'm sorry I was so upset
at you before.
It wasn't your fault
and I apologise.
It's just... It was such a shock.
But I want you to know that
your father and I stand behind you.
We're not gonna let anyone
find out about this.
We don't want you any more hurt
than you already have been.
And we'll find a doctor
who'll be able to take care
of everything for you.
I won't let your life
be ruined by this.
I'm keeping it.
- Oh, honey.
It's mine.
I know.
I know this is difficult.
But really,
you're still just a child.
There's so much
you have to live for and experience.
You don't want to be
tied down by... by a baby.
You have a future,
college, boyfriends...
I'm not gonna have any boyfriends!
What are you saying? Of course you gonna
have boyfriends. - I don't want any boyfriends!
What do you mean, you don't want any?
- I mean I don't want any!
Are you trying
to tell me something? Aviva?
It's OK. You can talk to me.
Are you a...
- No!
Aviva, it's OK. It's OK if you are.
There's nothing to feel bad about.
You know that I'll always
accept you, no matter what.
You know that you're my one and only.
My sweetie-pie.
You know I'm on your side.
But really...
Be reasonable.
The baby has to go.
What happens
if it turns out deformed?
If it's missing a leg or an arm
or a nose or an eye?
If it's brain-damaged
or mentally retarded?
Children of very young mothers often
turn out that way and then what?
Then you're stuck.
Your life is ruined forever!
You end up on food stamps, alone!
But it's my baby!
- But it's not a baby! Not yet!
Really, it's just...
It's like it's just a tumour!
I'm keeping it.
No, you're not.
Yes, I am.
You have the baby, you find another home.
- You can't take my baby away from me!
It's too late!
I already made the appointment.
<i>Honey, I know you're upset.
I spoke with your mom.</i>
<i>And I understand.
She's very upset also.</i>
<i>But could you please open the door
so just the two of us can talk?</i>
<i>Honey?</i>
<i>Honey, please.</i>
<i>You know you gonna have to come
out of there sooner or later.</i>
<i>Can't stay in there forever.</i>
<i>You gonna have to eat sometime,
go to the bathroom.</i>
<i>Honey, you've been
locked in there too long,</i>
<i>and I'm afraid if you don't open up,
I'm gonna have to force it open.</i>
<i>Please, honey.
Please don't make me force it open.</i>
<i>Look, Aviva, you're not making
this easy for either of us,</i>
<i>so why don't you just open the door and we can
discuss this in a calm, mature fashion like adults, OK?</i>
<i>Open up! I'm not kidding around!
Open the goddamn door!</i>
No!
<i>We'll take care of it tomorrow.</i>
<i>She's not coming out.
- She's coming out.</i>
<i>She's got no choice.
Come on, let's go to bed.</i>
Baby, I know how hard
this all has been.
And I'm so sorry, really.
But now I'm gonna tell you something
that I've never told you before,
but I think you're old enough now, so...
Well, when you were just
a little girl, about 3 or 4...
I was pregnant.
And at first I was all happy
and excited.
"A new friend for you," I thought.
"A little baby brother".
I used to think I'd call him Henry
after my grandfather Henrik,
who never cared about money.
But, well, then your father and I
had a long talk,
and I began to realise
there were other things
to think about.
Your father was out of work.
My paintings weren't selling.
I was blocked.
I started smoking again.
There were bills,
a mortgage, a lawsuit.
If I'd had another child...
I wouldn't have been able
to give you all that I have.
All the time we spend together,
just you and me,
and the little treats
your father and I pick up for you -
the 'N Sync tickets, the Gap account,
hand-packed quarts
of Ben and Jerry's.
We couldn't have afforded it.
It would have been too much of a strain
and we all would have been miserable.
I admit I was a little nervous
about the whole idea.
I was scared, just like you.
But it was the right choice,
and it was my choice.
So I grit my teeth,
thought of the future,
and once I came out
of that doctor's office,
well, honey, let me tell you,
I have never felt so relieved,
so good in all my life, as I did
after I took care of that little Henry.
And I have never regretted it since.
Honey...
you've got to be brave and do it.
Just like Mom.
Please.
Do it for me.
Shit.
<i>Nutcases.</i>
Ignore them.
Don't do it! Don't do it!
Don't do it! Don't do it!
Don't do it! Don't do it!
Don't do it!
Don't do it! Don't do it!
Everything's gonna be all right.
Doctor Fleischer's the best.
Very gentle.
Just like he was with me.
My baby girl.
Dr Fleischer?
Dr Fleischer, is she OK?
I'm sorry.
There was extreme haemorrhaging.
I...
I... I don't...
You mean that there's no...
In rare cases,
with very young...
the uterus...
the wall of the uterus can tear...
Joyce?
Joyce, what's happened?
We, uh...
We had to perform a hysterectomy.
But I thought...
I'm sorry.
God! No! No!
I'll never have any grandchildren!
Oh, my God!
Hey there, sweetie.
Is it all over?
Yes, and you're all OK.
100% OK.
Everything's OK.
Dr Fleischer said, good as new.
Really?
Mhm.
That's right, honey.
Good...
Mom?
Yes, sweetie?
Was it a boy or a girl?
It doesn't matter.
But I want to know.
- No, you don't.
Tell me...
please.
It was a girl.
Henrietta.
Hey there, what are you doing here?
Do you need a lift?
Come on, I'll take you home.
- I'm not going home.
Yeah, right.
You'd rather be raped
by a serial killer? Go on, get in.
Do you know your name's a palindrome?
What's that?
A word. Spell it backwards
or forwards and it stays the same.
Never changes. Like Anna, or Ulu.
Or "Sums are not set
as a test on Erasmus".
I've got a file of them on my G4.
Please don't take me home.
You mind waiting for me for 5 minutes?
I have to pick up some zip disks.
OK.
<i>Take me please now,
Help me please</i>
<i>Get me please
Far, far away</i>
<i>To a place,
Any place, any place</i>
<i>I'm far away...</i>
<i>Got to find some,
Need to find</i>
<i>Better find some other way...</i>
Hey, you wanna play Geography?
Can you still get pregnant
when it goes in there?
What's your name?
Joe. You?
I'm... I'm Henrietta.
Hello, Henrietta.
Hello, Joe.
Joe...
I had a good time last night.
I mean, I never knew
it was so beautiful.
Me, too.
Joe...
<i>Yeah?</i>
Do you think next time
you could try coming inside me?
I mean, the regular way?
Sure. Yeah, I can do that.
I'll meet you in the coffee shop.
Hello?
Hello.
Are you OK?
Yeah.
What are you doing here?
I got lost.
Huh...
What's your name?
Henrietta.
Hi, Henrietta. I'm Peter Paul.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, too.
Want some Nerds?
Thank you.
Would you like to come with me?
I'll take you to my house.
OK.
- Here, take my hand.
<i>Come on. We're almost there.</i>
Hi, Trixie. Hi, Barbara.
Hi, Peter Paul.
- Who's your new friend?
This is Henrietta.
I found her by the brook.
Hi, Henrietta.
- Nice to meet you.
Hi. Nice to meet you, too.
- Need any help?
Oh no, we're OK. Why dont you take
Henrietta inside to Mama Sunshine?
She looks a little tired.
- OK, we'll see you later.
Hey, Shazaam.
- Hey, Double P.
How's it going? Catch any fish?
- You bet I did.
What's the matter?
Don't you worry about a thing.
Everyone loves Mama Sunshine.
Mama Sunshine!
- Peter Paul, is that you?
Look, I have a new friend.
Her name is Henrietta.
Well, hi there, Henrietta.
Can I get you something to eat?
<i>You sure look do like you could use
a little home cooking.</i>
Well, that would be very nice, but I...
- Oh, no 'but-but's here, Henrietta.
Jesus tears!
- Can I please have a glass of Evian?
Oh, we don't drink fancy delancey here.
How's about a glass of good old-fashion Cola instead?
OK. Thank you.
Here, try one. She makes
the best Jesus tears in the state!
Hi, there.
Hi.
<i>Feeling better?</i>
Where... where am I?
- At the Sunshine's.
Come. You wanna sit up
and have some tea?
Oh, don't worry, dear.
I put your stuff in the wash.
And I got some fresh clothes for you to ware
when you're feeling better in the morning
laid out right over there,
all nice and clean.
Thank you.
Your parents must be
so worried about you.
They're not.
- Now, how can you say such a thing?
You know, when you were
all sleepy-bye,
our neighbour Dr Dan
came by and examined you.
<i>He said it sure look like
you've been having some adventures.</i>
What do you mean?
Who's Dr Dan?
Oh, don't worry, dear. He's an old
family friend and a very fine doctor.
You'd like Dr Dan.
He's the nicest!
<i>Now, sweetie,
everything's gonna be fine.</i>
He just said you look like you were
a little dehydrated there.
That just means you have to drink
lots of liquids, so finish up that tea!
<i>That's right.</i>
Now...
you wanna tell me
about what happened?
<i>Did you run away from home?</i>
Open your heart.
This is a house of love and faith.
The Lord is merciful.
- The Lord?
Jesus Christ.
<i>Please, Henrietta.</i>
My parents are dead.
They died in
the September 11th attacks.
<i>Vaporised. Burned to ashes.</i>
Their bodies never recovered.
I loved them very much.
It's OK. Go on.
So then, my grandmother
took care of me for a while.
She was very loving
and she liked giving me presents.
<i>She surprised me with one
every day after school.</i>
But then she died.
Brain cancer.
I miss her so much.
- Here.
Thank you.
So then I had no other relatives,
so they put me in a foster home.
It was horrible.
The father, he was an alcoholic,
and he tried to...
Oh, I can't talk any more!
Hush, don't cry.
Oh, honey!
Mama Sunshine, can she stay with us?
Can she, Mama Sunshine?
<i>Can she, please?</i>
Could I?
Just for a little while.
I'm so scared of going back.
Of course, sweetie, of course.
Mama Sunshine could never
turn away a needy child.
It's true.
Still, I have to discuss it
with the man of the house.
But don't you worry.
I can hear God in your little heart.
Jesus cares.
Now, you drink up the rest of
this tea and you go back to sleep.
We'll see you bright and early, OK?
Thank you, Mama Sunshine.
Sweet dreams.
<i>Rise and shine!
Rise and shine!</i>
Good morning, Henrietta.
- Good morning.
Good morning!
Oh, well, don't you look nice today?
Come over here and sit down. I've got
a nice cosy corner seat for you.
And I'll introduce you to everybody,
starting with the head of
the household, my husband Bo.
That's right. No 'mister' nothing here, you just
call me Bo. - And I'm Barbara. Remember me?
She's blind.
- Hush now!
Jiminy here.
- Hi, I'm Crystal.
And I'm Skippy,
just like the peanut butter!
And my name's Ali. - He was born
heathen. But don't worry, he's been saved.
Peter Paul!
- You know me, I'm Shazaam.
And I'm Trixie, remember?
I'm Ellen, but everyone here
calls me 'EII'.
For leukaemia.
- Now, Peter Paul!
Ell is in remission, and she's doing
just fine, thank the Lord.
And I'm Carlito. I'm epileptic.
- Oh, you! You're just fine.
He's under medication, too.
Dr Dan.
And that's Cuddles!
And you, young lady,
forgive me, you're...
Henrietta.
- Well, welcome, Henrietta.
Welcome to the family.
- Welcome, Henrietta!
Thank you.
Thank you for having me. I, um...
I...
Oh...
- Ohh...
Well, I think it's about time
we all say grace.
Bless us, oh Lord, and these Thy gifts,
which we are about to receive
<i>from Thy bounty,
through Christ our Lord.</i>
Amen.
- Amen.
In this house, we believe in
a healthy start to a healthy day.
Pass the freedom toast, please.
The bacon sure is is good today,
Mama Sunshine. - It's fat and greasy!
Barbara helped me.
- Oh, I just watched the flame.
You most certainly did more than just watch the flame.
Why, you cut open the package all by yourself.
I guess that's true.
So, Henrietta, tell us about yourselfs.
You like cooking or sewing?
Actually, I've never really
cooked before. - Never cooked?
Over here we take turns
doing everything. - Teamwork!
Everyone gets a chance to learn this way.
- Your mother never taught you how to cook?
Not even to microwave?
My Mom didn't believe
in microwaves. She was organic.
Oh, that's OK, honey.
With Jesus's help, you'll
pick up things pretty fast here.
I can teach you how to work the microwave.
- But Skippy, last time you almost blew us all up!
You know, it's all thanks to Jesus that Mama
Sunshine and I have been able to save all these lives.
<i>Each one here has a story,
you know that?</i>
Every little one of us, it's true.
Barbara, why don't you share yours?
Is Henrietta gonna join our
singing group, Mama Sunshine?
Shh, shh, not now, Carlito. Let's listen to
Barbara's story first. Go on, honey.
Well, my mother was a
drug addict, living in sin.
She didn't believe in God
or anything.
And when she got pregnant,
she took a lot more drugs.
<i>I was born blind as a result of all the drugs,
but my mother didn't care.</i>
<i>She didn't want me here in the first place.</i>
She even tried to kill me inside her
with a coat hanger, but I survived.
She was so angry, she never spoke
to me the first 3 years of my life.
<i>She just hit me and beat me
and cursed me every day.</i>
I don't remember any of this,
but this is what I had later found out
after my mother overdosed
choking on her own vomit.
I was sent to series of institutions
and had psychological evaluations.
But I wouldn't speak,
until one day, Bo and Mama Sunshine
came to help a child in need.
<i>They introduced me to the Lord,
and Saviour, Jesus Christ.</i>
They saved me from perdition.
I mean, Jesus saved me.
Amen.
Thank you, Barbara.
- Can you pass me the syrup, honey?
Oh, Peter Paul, you're so nice.
And your family, they're all so nice.
It makes me sad. I mean...
Don't be, Henrietta,
'cause what's mine is yours.
And you're a member of this family, too.
Come on, I've still got some time
before music practice.
Let me show you something.
<i>Gee, that place looks kind of scary.</i>
<i>You think anybody lives there?</i>
That's our neighbour Earl's house.
It's not scary at all.
Earl lives alone. He moved here
just a few years ago.
He was arrested in Wyoming once
for something terrible,
<i>but he's paid his debt to society
and has been reborn.</i>
<i>And now, he's just the nicest guy you
can imagine. You wanna go say hi?</i>
Maybe later. Let's keep walking.
- OK.
Peter Paul?
- Yes, Henrietta?
I was wondering,
after meeting your family and all...
Well, do you have,
like, a disability?
Oh, me? I'm fine.
I just have to clean the mucus
out of my lungs before I go to bed.
Hey! See this?
- Yeah.
Kind of smells, doesn't it?
Uh-huh.
It's not just a regular garbage heap.
This is where they throw out
unborn babies.
See, every so often, a truck comes by
from some baby killers and dumps this stuff.
<i>If you look around, you might find some
dead babies wrapped up in plastic.</i>
Mama Sunshine comes here
once a week looking for them.
And if she finds one, then gives them a proper
Christian burial so they don't fry in Hell.
Hey, look. There's one!
I'm sorry, Henrietta!
I didn't mean to upset you.
I just thought you wanted to see.
I'm sorry.
It's OK.
I should have known better.
Most girls don't really like it here.
I just was thinking about
what Jesus said in the Bible.
"Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father's good
pleasure to give you the Kingdom".
Luke 12, verse 32.
Come, let's get down
on our knees and pray.
Now repeat after me - "Lord Jesus".
Lord Jesus.
Please take care of all the unborn babies.
And make sure they're happy in Heaven.
Even the ones
that aren't wrapped in plastic bags.
Even the ones that were strangled,
suffocated, drowned or incinerated.
Even the ones whose bodies
were pulled apart limb by limb -
head cut off, eyes plucked out.
Even the ones
who had no fingers or toes,
missing ears and noses,
no brain or heart.
Amen.
- Amen.
<i>Nobody else
Could ever love me this way</i>
<i>Nobody, Jesus, but you
Ain't nobody</i>
<i>Nobody else
Could ever get me to feel</i>
<i>The way that you always do
Hey, hey, yeah</i>
<i>We're going to Heaven
And we're so excited</i>
<i>'Cause there's a party
And we're all invited</i>
<i>Nobody else
Could ever love me this way</i>
<i>Nobody</i>
<i>Nobody, Jesus, but you</i>
<i>Hallelujah</i>
<i>We praise your name</i>
<i>And all of the things that you do
Sweet, sweet Jesus</i>
<i>Hallelujah, we praise your name</i>
<i>Nobody, Jesus, but you!</i>
Wow! You guys are great.
You're all so talented.
You should go on MTV.
- Thanks.
We do gospel tours every spring.
- We have a CD. You want to hear it?
And we were on The 700 Club.
- Twice.
Almost.
But it's important to remember: this is about
celebrating Jesus, not profiting from Him.
Do you wanna join the group?
- Do you think I could?
Sure!
But what would I do?
I don't really play any instruments.
You can join in on the Hallelujah
chorus. Come on, I'll show you how.
Go on, sweetie.
- Gee, thanks, but where should I go?
You just stand here,
right next to me.
Shazaam, give us a beat!
1, 2, 3...
<i>Nobody else
Could ever love me this way</i>
<i>Nobody, Jesus, but you...</i>
<i>Ain't nobody</i>
<i>Nobody else could ever get me to feel...</i>
Peter Paul, treatment!
- Sorry.
Henrietta, can you help me
with the folding for just a minute?
Sure, Mama Sunshine.
"Sunshine Sin"?
"Sunshine Singers"!
- Oh, thank goodness!
I hate to bother you, honey.
I've got so much ironing,
and I wanted a chance to talk to you, too.
You've been so busy today.
Tell me, Henrietta, are you feeling
comfortable here with us? - Sure.
'Cause I know it's your
first day and all. - I'm comfortable.
Good, 'cause it's important to feel comfortable.
I mean, you've been through so much.
Is there something...
- Oh, no, no, no. It's just...
You don't want me to be part of the
the Sunshine Singers, do you?
Oh, Henrietta, of course I'd love you
to be a Sunshine Singer.
But I was just a little concerned,
because, well...
Peter Paul told me where
he took you today. - Oh.
It was a terrible mistake.
He shouldn't have shown you
without telling me.
If it weren't for his... condition,
I'd...
Oh, Henrietta,
there's such terrible and evil things
out there in the world...
and you're such an innocent...
so pure and untarnished,
like a little angel.
Well, I hope you can forgive us,
forgive me.
I'd just go to pieces if you...
if you had nightmares now,
or decided to leave us,
run away so soon.
Last year, our special daughter
Nainika ran away,
and... she didn't even have any legs.
She wanted to return
to her birthplace in India.
Poor child. She didn't even make it
as far as India, Tennessee.
I was a child runaway.
That's why children
are just... everything to me.
All God's children.
And so long as I'm here,
I'm gonna do whatever it takes,
come what may, to protect them!
But of course, I'll understand
if you feel you have to leave, but...
'Cause it's really all my fault.
- Oh, Mama Sunshine, please don't cry.
<i>I pledge allegiance</i>
<i>to the flag of the
United States of America</i>

<i>You've got to fight
For the children</i>
<i>You know they would fight for you</i>
<i>Every baby has a right to be born</i>
<i>Listen people,
There's a role we can play</i>
<i>Every baby has a right to be born</i>
<i>Don't turn your back now
They're crying out today</i>
<i>You got to fight for the children</i>
<i>Tell me what would Jesus do?</i>
<i>You got to fight for the children</i>
<i>You know
They would fight for you.</i>
<i>Coming!</i>
Hey, it's Dr Dan!
- And Earl too!
Hey, let's sing the Dr Dan song!
<i>Go, Dr Dan</i>
<i>Go, Dr Dan
Go! Go!</i>
<i>It's time for you to get down</i>
<i>Go, Dr Dan</i>
<i>Go, Dr Dan
Go! Go!</i>
<i>Shake it down to the ground</i>
<i>When you put your feet in motion
In motion</i>
<i>Everybody knows you're the man
Who's the man</i>
<i>Dancing for the love of the Lord
My Dr Dan</i>
<i>Ooh, Dr Dan</i>
<i>Go, go, go, Dr Dan...</i>
<i>I love you children! You're absolutely
wonderful, like a choir of little angels!</i>
<i>5 minutes,
creamsicles for everybody!</i>
Earl? Earl...
Go, go, go, go, go!
Go, go, go, go, my Dr Dan!
<i>And behold -
Jesus walked on the water.</i>
<i>And when they saw Him walking
across the top of the sea, </i>
<i>they turned white and gasped,
"It is a ghost!"</i>
<i>But Jesus spoke
to them calmly, saying, </i>
<i>"Be of good cheer,
and fear not, for it is I".</i>
<i>Peter turned to Him and shouted, </i>
<i>"Lord, if it is you,
let me come to you in the water".</i>
<i>"Come," said Jesus.</i>
<i>And so Peter tried walking on the water, </i>
<i>but he became afraid
and began to sink.</i>
<i>"Lord, save me!" Peter cried.</i>
<i>And Jesus bent over the water,
stretched forth His hand</i>
<i>and saved him.</i>
<i>"O ye of little faith.
Why did you doubt?"</i>
<i>And when they returned to the boat...</i>
<i>Fleischer...
Fleischer.</i>
<i>You know what 'Fleischer' means?</i>
What?
- 'Butcher'.
Oh, good God!
Now, I've got all the details
on this Fleischer here in this envelope -
home and work address,
licence plate number,
golf club, maps etc.
It should take about 3 days of driving
for you to get out there
and take care of him.
Call me as soon
as the job's done, OK?
OK.
Earl?
Earl!
<i>Are you sure you're ready
to go through with this?</i>
Uh-huh.
<i>Because you seem a little, uh...</i>
<i>I don't know...
a little preoccupied tonight.</i>
No, sorry. Just...
I'm tired, that's all. Work.
Bo?
- Yeah?
One more thing
before we say goodnight.
What's on your mind?
That new girl of yours...
Yeah, what about her?
I don't know how to say this, Bo,
but when I examined her yesterday...
Yeah?
- That girl's a child whore.
I just think you
ought to know that much
before you go any further with her
becoming the part of the family and all.
You mean, you checked her?
Mama Sunshine doesn't know
about this, does she?
No, I thought you should know first.
I wasn't sure she could handle this.
I never had a slut
in my house before.
Well, maybe she's not a slut.
It's worse than that, Earl.
I took some pictures.
Just got them developed.
Look here. - Let me see those.
Oh, dear Lord!
Oh, sweet Jesus!
<i>Refreshments, men!</i>
I've got all your favorites!
<i>Here we go!
- Wonderful!</i>
Goodbye, Peter Paul.
I'll miss you.
<i>Harlot! Harlot!</i>
No! No! Get away!
Get away from here!
<i>Get away from me! Get away...
Get away, get away...</i>
Why did you leave me?
How did you get here?
You have to go. Go home!
No, I wanna be with you.
I feel comfortable with you.
You're too young.
- No, I'm not. You know I'm not.
I don't know you.
But you know me.
You know you know me.
I can't know you!
- But you do! You do! You do!
I know Dr Fleischer.
<i>Time to take now
Time to make</i>
<i>Time to make
Right out of wrong</i>
<i>Got to be, try to be</i>
<i>Have to be, need to be strong</i>
<i>Then I'll be, wanna be</i>
<i>gonna be up on a cloud</i>
<i>Love is near, love is here</i>
<i>Love is here, up on a cloud...</i>
Have you ever been in love?
What do you mean?
I don't know.
I was just wondering because...
well... I think we should talk
about our relationship.
Women basically don't like me.
Is that why you're not married?
I don't know.
I guess maybe
I don't like women, either.
Well... what about me?
You're not a woman.
Not yet.
What am l, then?
You're...
different.
Earl...
do you think you could
make love to me tonight?
Even if it's not the regular way.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
I was moving too fast.
I'm sorry, I...
It's OK.
It's OK, I understand.
Relationships take time.
<i>We need a story.
- What do you mean?</i>
Just in case.
Oh. Yeah.
You're my daughter.
No, my half-sister.
No...
No.
Maybe you could be
one of my teachers.
What subject?
- Math?
No good. I can't fake that.
- History?
PE?
Maybe you're a policeman, you're undercover,
and you're returning me to my parents.
Maybe I just set up an undercover
sting operation f-for paedophiles.
And I'm the decoy!
I could pass for Mexican.
Maybe I could be your driver.
Do you speak Spanish?
- No.
Maybe...
Why can't we just be friends?
I think you'll have to be
my daughter...
but adopted.
Can't I be your wife? Please?
I really think I could pass.
No. It wouldn't be legal.
You're my...
daughter.
What?
Sickos.
What do we do now?
We'll lay low,
then come back after dark.
You stay here.
- No, I wanna come.
It's no good if you come.
I need you as a lookout.
I honk once, I come back,
we get out of here.
No. I'm coming.
- Don't make me mad.
I'm coming. I have to.
You don't know him. I do.
...you! Baby, It's You!
OK, OK, my turn, my turn, my turn.
My turn, right?
<i>Do it.</i>
Do it!
<i>Do it!</i>
<i>Oh, my God!</i>
<i>Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!</i>
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!
I'm going straight to Hell!
Calm down, Earl! Stop speeding!
- I'll get caught!
They're gonna fry me!
Oh God, I don't wanna die!
Stop it, stop it! Please stop it!
- Oh, God, it's over! I'm dead meat!
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Earl, get a hold of yourself!
Is she your daughter?
- Half-daughter.
Feel better?
I did the wrong thing.
No! No, you did the right thing.
He deserved it.
He was a terrible person. Terrible!
- But the girl!
It was an accident.
- Oh, the girl, the girl.
Maybe she's OK.
- Oh, God hates me.
No, God loves you!
- I'm gonna fry.
No! No, you're innocent like a baby.
You did what you had to do.
You did it for me
and the other little babies.
Babies that want to live.
- I want to live, too.
I want to start a new life,
a good life,
with no mistakes this time.
We could have children.
I promise. Lots.
I'd be a Dad and you'd be a Mom
and there'd be so much love and tenderness
for the world and for every living creature.
I could change,
but now I'm gonna die!
No, no! I'll tell them I did it.
That I pulled the trigger.
Would you do that?
- Yes, I'd do anything for you.
But you can't!
You're too young and innocent!
No, but I love you.
- Oh, God, I wanna die!
I wanna die!
How many more times
can I be born again?
Hello?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh. OK.
Yeah...
OK.
Who was that?
- The cops are here.
We're surrounded.
What are you doing?
I'm gonna say goodbye.
- Oh, God!
Oh, God, I hate this world!
Don't say that.
God created it.
Oh, Earl! Earl, Earl!
- My real name's Bob.
My real name's Aviva.
Wait!
OK, who else?
We've got the Paskows...
the Santolas, the Weisses, the Wongs.
What about the Wieners?
Well, of course, of course. We have Harv
and Marj and Missy and Vlad and little Di.
What about Mark?
- Steve...
She's old enough.
Tell her.
Your cousin Mark is a child molester.
An accused child molester.
Missy had him arrested.
She said that her little baby Diana...
- Princess Diana.
Little Di was molested, and it was when
Mark was alone with her babysitting.
Nobody's proven anything.
It hasn't gone to court.
Poor Marj.
She's been through so much.
And Missy herself was kidnapped by a child molester
when she was a little girl, so you can imagine.
It's been in all the papers, but really
there's no evidence. The whole thing's a mess.
That Mark was always a little weird.
- He seemed pretty regular to me.
Yeah, well... So you see my situation?
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
I think you should invite him.
OK. It's your party.
Jesus Christ!
Mom, are you OK?
Sometimes it's so hard
to be a good mother.
God knows, I tried.
Then I was so scared, Aviva.
Am I a terrible mother?
Everybody makes mistakes.
I'm gonna change now.
I did some real soul-searching.
And I'm gonna be a better mother.
I promise.
So, that's it? No one else?
I think you should invite
Mama Sunshine and her family also.
Honey, they live so far away.
Sweetie...
wasn't the father indicted?
I want them to come.
OK.
OK, I could
send them an invitation.
Marj wouldn't come, you know.
She says she's just too upset.
Nobody feels for Marj like I do.
Well, it's out of proportion.
You know Missy.
I don't know what she's saying.
Is she making it up or what? I don't know.
Mark's a good kid.
- Hey, sweetie.
Teriyaki soy dog?
They're your favorite... OK.
They'll be here.
<i>Welcome home, Aviva!</i>
Don't look.
Mark Wiener is looking at you.
Let's get out of here.
Hey.
- I'm glad you came.
I had to. Not coming
would be an admission of guilt.
I have to hold onto
some shred of dignity.
<i>So, how's it feel being back home?</i>
OK.
Dawn tried to do the same thing
when she was your age.
It's always a mistake.
It never works.
Do I remind you of Dawn?
Yeah, a little.
But of course different.
She was she. You're you.
X is not equal to Y.
Do you think I'll end up like her?
People always end up
the way they start it out.
No one ever changes.
They think they do, but they don't.
If you're the depressed type now,
that's the way you'll always be.
If you're the mindless happy type now,
that's the way you'll be when you grow up.
You may lose weight,
your face might clear up,
get a body tan, a breast enlargement,
a sex change-makes no difference.
Essentially, from in front,
from behind,
whether you're 13 or 50,
you'll always be the same.
Are you the same?
Yeah.
- Are you glad you're the same?
It doesn't matter if I'm glad.
There's no free will.
I mean, I have no choice
but to choose what I choose,
<i>to do what I do,
to live as I live.</i>
Ultimately, we're all just robots,
programmed arbitrarily
by nature's genetic code.
But isn't there any hope?
For what?
We hope or despair because the way we've
been programmed. Genes and randomness.
That's all there is,
and none of it matters.
Does that mean you're never going
to get married and have children?
I have no innate desire
to get married or have kids,
but that's beyond my control.
Really, it makes no difference, since the
planet is fast-running out of natural resources,
and we won't survive
to the next century.
But what if you're wrong?
What if there is a God?
If that makes you feel better.
<i>Look, mommy, look!</i>
Gwyneth, no!
<i>Do you...</i>
Do you think Dawn was ever
any happier when she was older?
Yeah. There were moments.
Moments... here and there...
Maybe when she got in to Rutgers,
I guess. I don't know.
Aviva? Aviva, come over here. Come here.
I want to introduce you to somebody.
I gotta go.
Thanks for coming over to talk to me.
I appreciate it.
I'm not a paedophile.
I know.
I believe you,
'cause paedophiles love children.
Hey.
- Hey.
How's it going?
- OK.
It only took 3 and a half hours.
There wasn't any traffic.
How do you like the car?
It's nice.
It's a Corvette C5.
It gets really good miles per gallon.
Your Dad buy it for you?
- Uh... yeah.
But, uh... I'm gonna pay him back.
The radio doesn't work.
I don't know what happened.
I've got built-in speakers.
But I gotta get it fixed.
You know, Judah,
you look a little different.
I changed my name.
- Really? To what?
Otto. It's my middle name.
I think it sounds a lot cooler.
So from now on,
I tell everyone to call me Otto.
I'm really glad you called me.
Me, too.
Your parents always hung up on me
whenever I try calling.
I know.
I was worried about you.
Your parents must have been
totally freaked out.
Yeah.
The cops asked me some questions.
They thought maybe I was involved.
I didn't tell them anything.
Are you seeing anyone?
Well, there are couple of girls who are
interested in me, but I don't know...
I like to play it cool, you know.
- Yeah.
I mean, I'm not interested
in just sex. I'm not like that.
<i>I know.</i>
How's your feature coming along?
I stopped working on it.
I decided my whole idea sucked.
I guess it's better
if you know it sucks now,
than working on it for 2 years
and then realising it sucks.
Aviva, I think I've kind of...
matured a lot since I last saw you.
Really changed.
One second.
Fuck! - No,
that was... good! Much better!
But then it slipped out!
- Part of it got inside.
Yeah, but the timing
was totally off. Fuck!
God, no! It was really good!
And a lot of it
really did get inside me.
You're just saying that.
- No, I mean it.
Really? You mean, like...
Yes, Otto, and I have a feeling,
though it's just a feeling,
that this time...
I'm going to be a Mom.
<i>Everybody's different
In this great big world</i>
<i>That's what life is all about</i>
