<i>It is, for better or worse,
the birthplace of grunge.
<i>Seattle-based bands...

for the past few years.
<i>Nirvana, Pearl Jam,
and Soundgarden...

of records.
<i>Independent releases
to a major label debut...
<i>A musical movement
centered around Seattle...

that became known as grunge.
<i>A month before that album
came out, they were...
<i>The basis of the generation...
<i>a... X society.
<i>Part of the grunge movement,
as I understand it...
<i>is the fact that these kids
have the ability to say...
<i>anything they want to say...
<i>express anything
they want to express...
<i>any anger, any pain,
any anguish, any torment...

a kinship, a oneness...

been through tragedy...
Thanks a lot.
This is gonna be the last song.
# Enough of your doctrines
# Your manifestos
# I'm a simple man
# And I speak with simple words
# Talk about inclusion,
not exclusion
# I sing my song

# Mountains, seas
# Fields and oceans

Remember those
big bubbles that used to...
float through
the middle of town?
Yeah!
These big...
like, bubbles, man.
They still do.
Yeah. You see them
once in a while.
They've got this big pit
out in the bay...
that's like, all...
like, this weird shit...
that comes out of the process,
and the way...
the bubbles, they're,
like, this big...
and they would float around,
and they're bad, toxic things.
So, the way
to get rid of it...
Is they got these
big water sprinklers...
and they just, like,
run sprinklers over it...
A bubble still gets
out once in a while.
- They're huge. They're like...
- The bubble of death.
I went to Bothell High School...
which is a suburban hell hole.
There's a sign
as you enter town.
It says, "Welcome to Bothell,
for a day or a lifetime."
And someone...
I wish I had've done it...
but someone erased
the B-O-T at one time...
so it was, "Welcome to hell
for a day or a lifetime."
The northwest is where
"flying saucers"...
the term "flying saucers"
was coined.
The northwest is where
"Louie, Louie" is from.
The northwest is where...
it's the serial killer
capital of the world.
We have more unsolved
serial killings up here...
than any other place
in the United States.
I mean, the Manson family
used to vacation up this way.
This place is weird.
Lot of occult stuff.
All this stuff is a factor
in what happened in the music.
I mean,
when the weather is crappy...
you don't want
to go outside.
You know, you basically
feel like staying in the house.
And, it's
a very logical thing...
to want to go down
into your basement...
and make noise
to take out your frustrations...
because you can't go outside...
and do anything
when it's raining all the time.
# Don't get off the bus
# 'Cause there ain't
nothing for you here
# In my hometown ##
Is Seattle a nice place to live?
It's the best place to live.
And I've traveled
all over the place...
and I honestly wouldn't live
anywhere else.
It has all the amenities
of a big city.
But, you know, there's nothing
you're missing out on...
by being in Seattle
as opposed to another city.
And it's pretty, you know?
There's hills and mountains
and trees and water.
So all these people come here...
and then there's
all this publicity...
and "Northern Exposure"
and "Twin Peaks".
And everybody wants
to come up here...
and live the good
yuppie lifestyle...
but all that time,
there's all these people...
that are underneath
that were here first...
and are just starving,
and they're all crazy.
I mean, it's like one of
those end-of-the-world places.
You can't go no further
and still be in the U.S.
# Oh yeah
# Since fourteen years ago
# I saw you out my door
# Can't you see me in that, so
# Oh, baby,
it's one night, so
# And I watch outside
# And I see you there
# And I wonder where
# And I take a stare
# I say, I watch outside
# Watch outside
# I watch outside
# Watch outside, yeah
# I watch outside
# I see you there
# I wonder where
# I take a stare
# I say I watch outside
# Watch outside
# I watch outside
# Watch outside
# I watch outside,
I see you ride
# I watch outside
and I see you ride
# I watch outside,
I want outside
# I watch outside,
I take a ride
# I watch outside ##
In 1980... I think bands
stopped coming to Seattle.
Bands never used
to come here...
'cause they'd go as far
as San Francisco...
and then not come
all the way up to Seattle...
because it wasn't worth it
to play one show.
There were 2, maybe 2½ clubs
where you could play...
if you were playing
your own music.
Some people
used to rent halls...
just put their whole show
on themselves.
Take tickets, run up,
do the music...
and at the end, pick up
the broom and clean it up.
# Let me call you about it
# Woke up this morning ##
Well, Seattle was really lame.
You know, specifically
in the early eighties...
I mean, Seattle was like
a million second cities.
It had a fake Talking Heads,
it had a fake Pere Ubu...
it had a fake Killing Joke...
it had all the fake Ramones
you could shake a stick at.
And people from Bellevue
singing with English accents.
There was this big
poodle metal scene...
bands with big, fancy guitars...
and just tons and tons
of hairspray, eyeliner.
See, all the extra-sleazy
punk rockers...
used to hang out
on First Avenue.
There's a donut shop
right there...
which is right next to
the Showbox...
which is right there...
it's a comedy club now.
And that was, like,
the big punk rock venue.
Opening Night, the very first
punk club in Seattle.
This is probably worth...
you know, 3, 400 bucks.
# Solid
# Action ##
Nobody was too worried
about success...
because we knew we were
living in Seattle.
It wasn't L.A. Nobody was
gonna come and sign us.
We played a show,
some small club.
The audience
consisted of...
members of the other
dozen or so bands...
that were playing similar bills
and similar clubs.
# Say goodnight,
then take a bite
# Then dig it a hole
# Take a light,
then take a bite
# Then dig it a hole ##
The bands
that stuck it out...
did it because they really,
really, really enjoyed...
playing their music.
And that was really the only
positive reinforcement...
that anybody got.
We really started playing music
'cause it's fun...
which probably most people say,
but with us, it's true.
- Yeah, everybody else is lying.
- Everybody else is lying.
# After all the trouble
has come and gone
# It was here for so long
# Now I've got
this sinking feeling
# Everyone seems to be leaving
# Oh, whoa
# I can't believe how lonely
it is here on K Street
# There's no one like me
here on K Street
# How lonely it is
here on K Street today
# Today
# Today, today #
I've never been in any other
spot in the country...
where so many people
play, you know?
You know, there's tons
of shitty bands...
but there's, like,
tons of great bands, too.
The most interesting
music around here...
is definitely
coming from places...
where people are just
playing in the garage...
they're playing to themselves.
They're playing
to their friends.
Across the street lives...
these guys are in a band
called Sister Psychic.
And then there's another
band who practices there...
and they're all friends...
and then Her Fault,
my little brother's band...
and they're all friends.
They go to the show.
It's just friends playing music.
# Oh, and I can't believe
# How lonely it is
here on K Street
# There's no one like me
here on K Street
# How lonely it is
here on K Street today
# Today
# Today, today
# Today
# Today
# Today, today ##
We were all
so fucking bored...
out of our heads,
that it was get drunk...
fall down, and,
uh... you know...
throw your body around.
And all the bands that
came through Seattle...
at that time...
Scratch Acid and Big Black...
said that Seattle had
the most exciting...
potent scene
going on in the U.S.
They all loved to play here
because everyone...
would just, like, go nuts
and drink themselves...
into a frenzy and throw
themselves onstage...
and it was very flattering
for these bands, you know...
whereas you go to Los Angeles
and New York...
And people stood there
and went, "Hmm...
I don't know,
he missed a note there".
Best bands in Seattle were,
like, Malfunkshun...
the U-Men. Who else?
Skin Yard, My Eye, Feast...
64 Spiders, Bundle of Hiss.
Nobody ever remembers
Psycho Pop, man.
We could make a long list...
if we wanna talk about
all Tom's bands.
We were a good band, man!
We had a band called the Farts.
Red Dress... Blackouts...
The Blackouts were
an excellent band.
You know,
Three Swimmers, Beakers...
Little Bears in Bangkok...
Max Band, Quack Quack Quack.
Nobody knows these names.
This is ancient history.
One generation out
from a band is every band...
that shared a member
directly with that band.
For instance, you know...
Stone Gossard
was in Green River...
and then he went
to Mother Love Bone.
That's one generation out.
So, for instance,
you could take, like...
an early band
like the Blunt Objects...
and it asks you how many
generations...
Let's go four generations out.
So, you sort of have
these three columns...
the mainstream, heavy metal,
hard rock thing...
that, you know, Mother Love
Bone and Pearl Jam have done.
Then there's the Fastbacks,
the Posies, and...
the Young Fresh Fellows,
which were probably...
the first band to really
make it out of Seattle...
all by themselves,
without moving out of town.
And they were just, you know,
sort of a pop sound.
And then, the third branch
is noise/grunge rock.
That was closely related
to Green River and Mudhoney...
and the Thrown-ups
whole sort of sub-pop...
you know, grunge sound.
And it's pretty incestuous...
but you keep bumping into
the same old people.
Green River.
This was the genesis right here.
Steve and Mark from Mudhoney.
And Stone and Jeff
from Pearl Jam...
and Alex, who is now
studying to be a lawyer.
Room Nine
became Love Battery...
Bundle of Hiss became Tad,
Pure Joy became Flop...
Skin Yard,
among other things, became...
Grunt Truck.
Jesse Bernstein, who's dead.
Watch, folks.
Hundreds of dollars.
Don was in Butt Sweat.
And they played
at one skate contest.
You were, too, Tom. Don't lie.
And he was also in
the Kings of Rock.
So was Jim Tillman
from Love Battery.
What? Jim Tillman
wasn't in Butt Sweat.
- He played rhythm guitar.
- Did he?
Yep.
Remember, friends,
this is only a movie.
You're free to leave
the theater at any time.
# Well, I got batter
# Oh, you just add one

Someone said to me once
that there was...
the aesthetic of dumb
about the Seattle music scene...
that the music wasn't stupid,
but it was dumb.
You know, Mudhoney
is not stupid...
but they're
a little bit dumb.
My mom has always told me
that I am not a loser.
So, the whole loser thing,
I never believed in...
'cause clearly,
I am not a loser.
Mark, I think your mom
has told you the same thing.
We're not losers.
I guess it's really easy to
think of yourself as a loser...
'cause then you don't care
if people like you or not.
You know?
That's sort of the idea.
And then you can do
whatever you want.
And it's funny.
We were the guy in high school
who people used to beat up.
And we couldn't even talk
to the pretty girl.
I mean, we couldn't...
We're nerds, god damn it!
Well, I think ever since
Spinal Tap came out...
I mean, they were, like,
pointing the finger at...
bloated, overly commercialized,
diluted bands...
And we just looked
at ourselves and said...
"We don't have to point
at somebody else. We can..."
# You be the cat,
I'll be the mouse
# You be the cat,
and I'll be the mouse
# You be the cat, see?
I'll be the mouse
# Invite me over
to your mousetrap house
# It's a mousetrap
# You be the cat
# I'll be the mouse
# You be the cat
and I'll be the mouse
# Invite me over
to your mousetrap house
# Running in and out
of your steel catch
# Yeah, that's what
it's all about
# To you, to you
# To you, to you
# Mousetrap
# A mousetrap
# A mousetrap
# Mousetrap
# A mouse

# Aah
# Mousetrap ##
When you've been
through periods...
where you've had
keyboard players...
with 50,000 pounds worth
of kit onstage...
82 keyboards
and 95 samplers, you know...
after a while,
you just go, "Hang on.
"This is like eating
too much food at one sitting.
"There's too much sound.
It's too many colors.
"It's all got
poncey and posey.
Let's go and see some bands
where they just bash it out."
# Eat my dump
# Tell me if you love me
# Eat my dump
# Help me
# Smell my pie ##
Some bands get onstage,
and they're basically...
entertainers.
They have a shtick.
They are giving you a show.
Some bands get up there
and they rock.
And you can tell the difference.
That's why Seattle bands
tend to be...
a little bit inconsistent
live, I think...
is because most of them
aren't really up there...
to be entertainers.
They're up there to rock out.
And their best shows are when
they're having the most fun...
not when they necessarily
have their act down...
because maybe
they don't have an act.
If it's connecting
with the audience right...
I get chills.
I mean, I can just...
I finish a song,
and it feels right...
and I can just tell
it's gonna start going fine.
Man, I get chills.
And they're rockin',
and fuck yeah, let's go.
# You're putting on me
# And dealing with society
# The forces are close
# They're over the line
# I got a freaky feeling
in my soul
# Nerve going out of control
# Nowhere to turn, nowhere to hide
# I got a train driving
through my head
# Fever burning in my bed
# My telephone rings
# Somebody dead on the line
# I say 54/40 or fight
# 54/40 or fight
# 54, 54, 54/40 or fight
# All right
# Let's go
# You're watching it drop
# Had it to here
# They're taking him home
# Gotta get away
# Gotta get away
# Had it to here
# Gotta get away ##
There's a million people
out there that could do...
what I'm doing...
as far as producing...
recording,
anything like that...
a lot better than I'm doing,
have better equipment.
But still, the only way
you get good at anything...
is to be doing it
all the time.
So, this is a lifetime
chore for me.
Basically, it's just
to have complete control...
over everything.
To be able to do it
the way you wanna do it.
Have it come out
the right way...
and to not really...
have anybody that can tell you
what the hell to do...
where you can play, how you
can look, how you can dress.
What songs to record,
which ones not to.
It keeps it
on a personal level.
It keeps it where
rock and roll-type things...
really should be.
It's very much just
happening right there.
It's not happening
in somebody's...
big offices or in somebody's
big bank accounts or anything.
It's really exciting for
the people that are doing it.
# Some say,
"Dude, just forget her
# "In a world of your own
# "You let it make
every day pathetic
# You're in need of a cure".
She is one
# You'll survive a vegetable
# The meat's diseased
and she said so
# I won't try
to persuade you anymore
# A long time ago

PopLlama was a big influence.
Conrad can do it,
Sub Pop can do it.
We wanted to do our own record...
Well, hell.
If these guys can do it...
we've seen these guys so drunk
they can't stand up.
You know?
They can't drive a car...
And they can do this,
so we can do that.
That's just a given, I think...
with people here.
They don't sit around...
going, "Oh, nothing
ever happens here.
Nothing ever goes on here".
You know...
by the time the kid's
out of high school...
he's already been in a band,
put out a couple fanzines...
you know,
recorded a few records.
Started a label,
did a radio show.
And that was the whole lesson we
learned when we moved up here.
Like, you just do it.
We moved up here
And we saw other bands,
you know, no different than us.
Just putting out records.
All you really need
to do that...
is some magnetic tape
and a microphone.
And that's really all you need,
and then, you know, maybe...
just maybe...
some bad reverb.
And they smell good.
Records just smell good.
There's nothing like
cracking that cellophane...
and pulling that record out.
It just smells great.
When "Deep Six" first came out,
it was chronicling something...
that was suddenly
going on, I guess.
It was by a fluke
of providence.
Kind of the initial
document of...
what later turned in
to be a pretty big scene.
I think we all became aware...
that there was a certain
regional sound developing.
And nobody had a name for it.
That's punk rock, and...
one day, they just sort of
started going...
And that was grunge.
The most noisy...
most absurd...
heaviest thing
that was going.
Yeah, we know
this is heavy rock...
and heavy rock is kinda stupid,
but it's fun anyways.
It's when you had a band like
the Melvins doing Kiss covers.
It was all in fun.
It was, like...
"We know this is that this
is the cheesiest thing...
we could possibly do.
We gotta do it".
It's just ridiculousness,
complete ridiculousness.
What can we get away
with next, you know?
# Looking for one
like you were
# Holding like so long ago
# Like a hotel
# Like a fish store
# My world war tissue ##
Bands like Green River,
basically.
They were, sort of,
the definitive grunge band.
It was a euphemism
for, just, extremes...
extremes of anything.
And a lot of people say that
it's a throwback to metal.
Heavy metal is part of it.
It was one influence.
Punk rock was one influence.
Basically, anything loud...
and crushing and extreme
was an influence.
We'd all been in bands
that were more controlled...
and more dynamic,
you know, and...
you know... more... better...
better bands, actually.
And we just...
well, our whole thing was...
we just wanted to get away
from all structure...
and just be chaotic,
and not worry about that.
It was a kind of
joyful release.
It's taken rock
right back to its basics...
which is go out there
and make a hell of a noise.
And make sure you play music
your parents don't like.
# Wait
# I can't wait

First thing, actually...
was when we were doing
the first Soundgarden single...
and we were doing a song
called nothing to say...
which was just...
at the time,
just seemed amazingly heavy.
I thought this...
you know, these guys...
can't possibly be really
playing this song.
It sounds like... you know,
this sounds insane.
It sounds way too good
for 8-track...
and it sounds way too good for
a crappy little Seattle band.
# Someone said
# My words are out of balance
# Nothing to say
# You got nothing to say ##
Bruce Pavitt originally
had the name Sub Pop...
when he was living
in Olympia, I think.
He had a sort of
cassette fanzine network...
where he put out these
little compilation cassettes...
of local bands.
He was interested
in making it a vinyl magazine.
The bands he was
interested in at the time...
were Green River and us.
And John, also,
was a huge fan of ours.
He wanted to make a record...
start a record label...
so we talked about working
together to put out a record.
Up to that time,
everyone played it really safe.
All the small labels...
"We'll put out a single...
"every three months,
and, you know...
"we'll sell
1,000 copies of it...
and that's cool,
because I've got my day job".
And John and Bruce
were having none of that.
They said, "We don't want
to work day jobs.
"We don't want our bands
to work day jobs.
"We want them out there
on the road.
"We want them
in the big magazines.
"We want their records
everywhere.
"It is punk rock,
but we don't care.
We want to make it
bigger than punk rock".
And that's why
these two gentlemen...
are the kings of the scene,
as you might say.
There was a real indie ethic
in the eighties...
that you weren't supposed to be
proud of having hit records...
or being a hit machine.
And Jon and I,
as fans of, you know...
the history of pop music
in this this country...
really admired labels
like Motown...
and their hit factory...
- Mentality.
- Yeah.
They definitely picked
a certain kind of band...
for their label,
which makes everybody think...
that that's the only thing
that was going on in Seattle.
By default, I ended up
engineering all of them...
and they had Charles doing
all of the photography...
so there was definitely
a package and an image...
and a sound.
I think every community
has their pools of talent.
It's just a matter
of being able to take on...
the responsibility
of marketing.
You know, I'm a failed
pop musician myself, so...
you know, I kind of decided...
well, I'm going to play in
crummy band after crummy band.
I may as well rep
some of these bands...
who might have a chance
at doing something.
Basically, he said,
"Hey, you sing about dogs...
"you sing about being sick.
You got a shtick,
it'll take you to the top".
And he basically gave us,
like, five chords...
But he said, "Don't use more
than three within one song".
# I feel bad
# Yeah, I've felt worse
# I'm a creep
# Yeah
# I'm a jerk
# Oh
# Touch me, I'm sick
# I won't live long
# And I'm full of rot
# Want to give you, girl
# Everything I got
# Oh
# Touch me, I'm sick
# Touch me, I'm sick #
When Sub Pop finally
got their act together...
and they started
somehow getting...
this underground
hype-thing going...
which started very small...
they flew an English
journalist into Seattle.
They took him to see
a Mudhoney show...
and gave him some singles
and had him meet everybody...
and he went back
and wrote a big article...
in one of
the English music papers...
and that sort of started
this big frenzy in England.
It just seemed like it was
a worthwhile business move.
Yeah. And fortunately, Everett
was a brilliant enough guy...
that he could piece
together a story...
that essentially sold
the world on Seattle.
# Love me, I'm rich
# Come on, baby
# Now, come with me
# If you don't come
# If you don't come
# If you don't come
# You'll die alone ##
Sub Pop...
the hype machine.
And we went along with it.
It seemed pretty funny
at the time.
They didn't really
hype their bands.
They hyped their label, which is
a much different thing...
a much more original thing.
It gave a record
this desirability...
this, perhaps,
fictional desirability...
but nonetheless,
it made the collectors...
try and get a hold
of these things...
and made people talk about them.
So, a lot of people
talked about Sub Pop...
and how cool
their records were...
and how cool the packaging,
and the bands were cool...
and "Oh, you can't get
the record.
It's worth
a lot of money already".
People started looking
for the Seattle sound...
the same way that D.C.,
and Boston, New York...
and L.A.,
and all those places...
had this crazy little identity
all of their own.
Seattle started getting
its own identity...
and Sub Pop decided
to exploit that.
# We're all right
# Yeah, all right
# So, you're looking
for something super
# Aren't we all?
# Yeah, all right
# Never knowing if it hit you
# Right between the eyes
# Yeah, all right
# Gonna lift you up
# Gonna bring you down
# Gonna let you
# Oh, gonna slide your heart
# Gonna let you follow
your own dream
# It'll turn your head around
# For the first time in your life
# You might find that
# For the second time
in a year
# I don't mind
# For the last time
# I think it's time to fly
# Freedom's right
# Between the eyes ##
Suddenly, there were three times
as many people...
that had been here all along.
Going out, seeing bands,
and supporting those bands...
and allowing the scene
to be far more viable.
What you actually see
happening in Seattle...
is this kind of explosion
of sub-culture.
I think it's a very
important thing...
and a very healthy thing
to have happen anywhere...
particularly
in a place like Seattle.
It's so conservative
and so reserved.
To have something like this
happen here has been...
nothing short of, like,
a major electrical shock.
Everything was suddenly
just buzzing with activity.
I mean, singles
were being put out...
there was no point
earlier in history...
that you could have
a magazine devote...
an entire record reviews section
just to local record reviews.
People from underground
fanzines across the country...
were already starting
to snipe about Seattle...
and how much hype
it was receiving.
When things started
to become spotlighted...
more venues opened up...
and more opportunities opened up
for people to play...
but there was never a lack
of great musical talent...
and it was always
really diverse.
And there was always an unspoken
sense of community about it.
# I'm so happy
# It's sunny outside
# I'm so happy
# It's snowing today
# I'm so... oh
# I'm so happy
# The world's gonna explode #
They won't let us in
because we're not 18.
And age doesn't have
anything to do with music!
# Burn the house down
# Burn the house down
# Ooh
# Ooh-ooh-ooh
# Ooh-ooh ##
The Seattle music scene
right now is really vital.
I mean, it is so alive.
It's better
than London in the 1960s.
It's better than New York
in the '70s. I mean...
Margaret, I was
in London in the 1960s.
I was in London in the 1960s.
It was awful!
If you say the word "scene"...
everybody rolls their eyes
and laughs at you.
It's, "Scene. Ha ha!"
You know, "There's no scene!"
So, a lot of people thought
that it has reached its peak...
and by next year,
we were all gonna go back...
to doing what we were doing.
And we were all gonna go back
to our little small town utopia.
And about 1990,
we all sort of went...
"Oh, good. It's over."
# Come out and play
# Make up the rules
# I'm not another child
as well
# It's not enough to raise you
# It's not enough to save you
# Hello, hello,
hello, how low
# Hello, hello,
hello, how low
# Hello, hello,
hello, how low
# Hello, hello, hello
# Well, I'm lyin'
and I'm famous
# Here we are now,
entertain us
# I feel stupid
and I'm waitin'
# Here we are now,
entertain us
# Yeah
# Hey ##
Nirvana kind of
came out of left field.
Namely Aberdeen,
which is a town...
sort of out in
the middle of nowhere.
And, you know,
we just got a phone call...
At the studio one day
from this guy, you know, Kurt.
He said he was a friend
of the Melvins...
and he wanted to come up
and just record some songs.
And I said OK.
A friend of the Melvins,
a friend of mine. Come on up.
I didn't know
who the hell he was...
and nobody else did,
either.
He just came up, blew out
ten songs in five hours.
We recorded and mixed them
in one afternoon.
And... blew me away.
I thought, "Oh, my God.
This is amazing".
I said, "Guys, can I please keep
a copy of this for myself...
before you go back
to Aberdeen?"
That was the tape
I gave to Jonathan.
This is my penultimate
grunge photo.
Kurt Cobain
spinning on his back.
Everyone asks, "How in the hell
is he doing that?"
I don't know.
# I'm a negative creep
# I'm a negative creep
# I'm a negative creep,
and I'm stoned
# I'm a negative creep,
I'm a negative creep
# I'm a negative creep ##
At that point, I think
Soundgarden had put out...
their first major label record.
It was doing OK.
I think Screaming Trees...
had put out their first
major label record.
I think it was doing OK.
Alice in Chains had put out...
their first major label record.
It was doing OK.
But, Nirvana was kind of
the little brother.
You know, the runt of
the litter, so to speak.
And I remember Jonathan
telling me in 1990...
he said, "This band
is going to be huge".
He said it exactly like that.
He said, "Jack, this band
is going to be huge".
The record came out
in fall... September.
The video came...
I remember the first time
I saw the video.
I thought,
"This is so cool...
"but there's no way
MTV will play this.
There's just no way".
And then when
that started going...
it reached millions
of kids instantly.
Ben would go off and call up
people back home in Seattle.
He'd come back and say...
you know,
the latest sales figures.
He'd go, "'Nevermind'
has done 300,000".
"'Nevermind'
has done 400,000".
"'Nevermind' just went gold".
# With the lights out
# It's less dangerous
# Here we are now,
entertain us
# I feel stupid
and contagious
# Here we are now,
entertain us
# A mulatto
# A denial
# A denial

# A denial ##
It was an old, brain song called
"Money Changes Everything".
I think we adapted that
to "Nirvana Changes Everything".
# Ow
# Ow
# Ow
# Ow
# Dust rise
# Right over my time
# Empty
# Fossil
# Of the new scene
# I feel so alone
# Gonna end up a big ol' pile
# Of them bones
# Yeah ##
That's probably why
you create in the first place.
Because of the freedom.
I mean, whatever you want...
you can lay
whatever you want on tape.
But again, commerce is involved.
And as soon as it starts
going through those channels...
those money-making channels...
everything changes.
When these bands started to
get popular, all of a sudden...
everyone wanted to find
the next Nirvana.
Everyone wanted to sign
the next Pearl Jam.
All of a sudden...
bands who'd never played
live before, practically...
were getting huge advances.
The labels started
bidding for bands...
to get bands signed...
so that they can then
sell them to a major...
The bands get all worked up...
and basically break verbal
contracts you make with them...
because, well,
you don't have a contract.
I mean, when I first started,
I didn't need contracts.
I didn't think I did.
You know, they were
"Here's my friends"...
but someone throws
500,000 in their face...
and they're like, "Huh?
We didn't have a contract".
If the major labels are like
a big, dumb Baby Huey...
You know, that...
"Oh! What's going on
in Athens?"
And waddle over to Athens
and you sit down in Athens...
and you start buying lunches...
and you crush
three bands by accident.
You know? Wow!
The party's in Athens.
And then you kind of look
over your shoulder.
You go,
"Oh! Minneapolis!"
And Baby Huey gets up and goes
and sits on Minneapolis...
and kills three bands
by accident...
and buys a bunch of lunches...
and, you know, kind of
plays that party out.
So, the idea that
they were moving and...
you know, sort of
dedicated clumps.
Seattle was just, like,
part of that process.
# Say good-bye
to your friends and family
# Welcome to the menagerie
# Funny how they forget
to tell you
# This is all you will ever be
# This is all
you will ever be, now
# This is all you will ever be
# This is all
you will ever be, now
# This is all you will ever be ##
The effect of this whole thing
of, like, hyping a label...
or hyping a sound,
or hyping a place...
is it starts to take
a lot of the attention...
away from the individual artists
that are making music.
Everyone doesn't
sound the same.
Everyone isn't grunge.
Everyone doesn't have long hair.
You know...
They made a big mistake.
They didn't go further...
and find more of the bands
that were already here...
and had been here...
even before the bands
that were exploited were.
That's what makes me
feel guilty...
of the success of our band.
Because it should've been...
spread out to the success of,
like, a number of bands here.
They focus on this one scene,
or one type of music...
when, really,
that's pretty inaccurate...
'cause there's all kinds
of bands here, you know.
There's, like, weird,
funky jazz bands...
and weird, you know,
hip-hop bands...
punk rock bands,
or metal bands, or whatever.
It's like there's
a whole bunch of stuff.
Surf bands and cowpoke bands.
There's a shitload...
of different bands here.
There always has been.
In Europe, they just started...
to put stickers on things
that just said "Seattle".
That's all the stickers said.
It's like, the stamp...
you know,
it's like the U.S.D.A.
It's, like, Seattle...
stamp it.
# Yeah
# Low beat #
Great band.
I like best.
# Low beat
# Low beat
# Get down now
# Hey
# Low beat
# Low beat, whoo ##
I hate category of grunge.
Grunge categorize... oh.
I only like live, loud music.
I don't need grunge.
# How many times
have you said I'm sorry
# To only trash me
within the day
# I think "God,
will I ever escape this?"
# Now my body just burns
# Beware of what I threw you
# Baggage like fire
just to thrill you
# Like I might turn
and sniff you
# Slippery near the edge #
Nirvana happening
or Pearl Jam happening...
in some way seems like
kind of a...
some kind of, like,
weird natural occurrence...
that got rolling in 1979.
It's that energy. Whatever
that energy started as...
ultimately, you know,
landed with what we got now.
It's not like
it's punk rock paying off.
It's more like you push
the pimple hard enough...
and it pops up someplace else.
But then it becomes
homogenized, manipulated...
and marketed, and it's not
intense anymore.
So, there's a constant
cycle of rebellion.
I think punk's going
to be there forever, man.
As long as there's kids
that like it.
Yeah. Kids are the most
important part of punk.
They want to get wild. Yeah.
There'll be no shortage...
of disaffected American youth
over the next fifty years.
Probably even more.
Some great rock 'n' roll
coming down the line.
# Slip through you, yeah ##
There's over 1,000 bands
in Seattle right now.
And I think a lot of that
is people moving here.
Bands moving here
in hopes of becoming famous.
Because of all the hype and
all the attention on Seattle...
people know that
if they do something here...
they're going get recognized
to some extent.
It won't be totally overlooked,
even if it's bad.
In fact, there were
musicians who moved...
to California in the early
eighties from Seattle...
to try and get signed,
who started moving back.
There's got
to be at least 1,000...
if not more than that,
in Seattle.
So, I came with an idea...
to package boxed sets
of northwest bands.
So, what I try and do, is I try
and find ways to exploit...
and I like the word
"exploit"...
exploit through propaganda
and television...
the northwest music community
as a whole.
Volume three is probably
my favorite set.
It's got some of
the most well-known bands.
You've got your Hammerbox,
and your Hungry Crocodiles...
and Pond, Sara DeBell,
Peace, Love, and Guitars.
Just got... I mean, it's got
so many great bands in it...
that if you want
to know anything about...
the northwest music...
there's my card...
you want to know anything about
the northwest music scene...
this is a great place to start
because all the cards...
have the contact information
of the band on the back.
And also,
if you take these cards...
turn them face down,
put them together...
it's a jigsaw puzzle
of a traffic jam on I-5.
# I say

Today, I was in a music shop...
and saw some people.
It was like...
"You moved from L.A.
Probably yesterday".
Like, I feel sorry
for the up-and-coming bands.
They can't even get gigs.
It takes them a year
sometimes to get a gig.
We were together three weeks
when we played a show.
You see a ton of bands?
The Trees weigh more than a ton.
We're a ton of band.
So, fuck 'em!
We got bands all over
this place here.
We got a band in here...
Inflatable Soul.
Manotypical.
Rap band in this room.
Hear a lone drummer
practicing in here.
Hip-hop beat.
Industrial nonsense
comes out of that flat.
It's all hallways and doorways.
Have bands in the rafters.
Bands to the left.
Bands to the right.
It'd be like being a kid
and setting up a lemonade stand.
And having a really
successful lemonade stand.
All of a sudden, ten of them
open up right next to you.
In your yard, on your block...
all competing for
the same lemonade nickel.
Only they're obviously selling
lower quality lemonade.
Right now, Seattle is
quarter until 6:00...
on Christmas Eve
in a shopping mall...
and the mall closes at 6:00.
When it's too crazy...
and it's loaded
with sub-moronic idiots...
prancing around...
buying anything they can
get their hands on.

Thanks, phone dude.
I think now's the time
that I should be announcing...
my candidacy
for mayor of Seattle.
The whole thing
was just out of control...
and press people were
visiting our office...
at the rate
of two or three a week.
It seemed like
very few of them had...
even the most remote clue...
of what was really
going on in Seattle.
Glossy print ad
with a fancy red car...
in the background...
and they're saying
something about grunge.
You think people are gonna
go out and buy this car?
They're gonna look at
this ad and go, "Fuck you".
When you're close
to something...
you feel you know
the truth about it.
And when people magazine
is writing about it...
you know that they're not
gonna have the truth.
They have a very
distorted view of it.
And you realize that that's
what the entire world sees...
and that's what the entire
world thinks about.
And they're wrong.
This is a photo of Seaweed
being interviewed by MTV.
A band that at the time
really weren't doing anything...
and here's MTV with
camera crews in their face.
And you know,
they laughed about it.
They thought it was ridiculous.
And everyone thought
it was a bit ridiculous.
Maybe there's, like,
a bunch of photographers...
and they want to put you
with this other person...
from another band
that you don't even know...
and they want you to put
your arm around them and smile.
And they want to talk about
all this mundane crap...
and then that's when
I start to feel cynical.
"You play in a band, don't you?"
"Yeah. Yeah,
I play in a band".
"Pearl Jam, right?"
"No".
"Aren't you the drummer
from Pearl Jam?"
"No. I'm not the drummer
from Pearl Jam".
"Alice in Chains?"
"No. No".
"Well, what's the name of
the band you play in?"
"Soundgarden".
Then you get the shrug, like...
They didn't say anything
about the music.
They talked about
what we wore...
and whether or not
the girl in the band before...
shaved her armpits or not.
The newest thing I heard...
was that we're really bad
at interviews.
Where could they
possibly get that?
# Just to wake up tells me,
hell, I must be brave
# It hits me like a drug
shot into my vein
# But it's not as delightful,
delightful of a pain
# Immobilizing me
# Almost makes me think
I'm dead
# I need a second skin
# Something to hold me tough
# Can't do it on my own
# Sometimes I need
just a little more help
# I want that chance to give
every drop that's left in me
# I need a second skin
# Something I cannot
break free of
# Well, I just tell myself,
girl, just let it breathe
# It's a calmness
I'm always searching for
# But the dirt,
it gets so heavy
# It falls above my head
# Seeping from under my feet
# It just keeps on
getting deeper
# I need a second skin
# Something to hold me tough
# Can't do it on my own
# Sometimes I need
just a little more help
# I've got that chance to give
every drop that's left in me
# I need a second skin
# Something I cannot
break free of ##
You just didn't want to answer
any more stupid questions.
They were all the same.
What's Seattle like?
What are the bands like?
Do you know this band?
Do you know that band?
Everyone had it.
We put a moratorium
at one point...
on people calling and asking
for the "Seattle story".
There was nothing to do...
except just start poking
fun at the entire thing.
And so, instead of saying...
"No, I really don't know
that person"...
it would turn into, "Oh, sure,
every Monday morning...
we eat banana splits
at breakfast time".
"Shooby-doo used to be
my roommate".
Or, you know,
"I'll tell you...
"he has a horrible
case of the squirts...
after he has indian food".
And you just start making up
every single lie you can...
and then try to...
the goal is to just get...
crazy rumors circulating
all the time.
There's a big element of put-on
involved with all Seattle music.
I mean, Kurt Cobain's
goofy name-spellings...
a lot of Sub Pop's world
domination kind of attitude.
I mean, the whole thing's
ridiculous.
75% of what Bruce
and John say is a lie.
But it's served them well.
It's essentially been
one big prank.
We've always pretended
we were something we weren't.
Now that we're huge
and have a lot of money...
we're trying to pretend
that we're small and indie...
and have street cred.
That's one of the great things
about a lot of the bands here.
You know, great humor.
You know?
So, I'm obviously not from here.
One of my favorite hoaxes
was the lexicon of grunge.
The "New York Times"
called Sub Pop records...
and talked to a woman there who
just started making up words.
They were trying to find out...
what the inside secret dope was,
what was the hip language.
And I was, like, "Why don't you
just give me a word...
and I'll give you
the grunge slang for it".
She just started
making stuff up.
A lot of it was
the kind of stuff...
that she used for herself
just for laughs.
And next thing you know...
it's on the cover
of the "New York Times".
And everybody around here is
just giggling and snortin'.
If they're lame enough
to try to scrutinize...
this totally stupid thing,
why not fuck with them?
# I try to speak my mind
# Why'd you leave me
# I could've taken you so far
# Walked out the way
# Been across this fuckin' world
# To find my Brewster
# Put my love into the rig
# So I could forget her
# Hello
# It's me again, baby
# Hello, Houston ##
As you can see,
I am basically...
a trend-setter
in the fashion scene.
And "Rolling Stone" called...
and they were doing
a fashion spread...
on what the indies
are wearing.
I had to tell them
that I didn't think...
they'd be interested in me...
but that we had a fella here,
Scott McCaughey...
from the Young Fresh Fellows...
who probably was just what
they were looking for.
So, they came, and they
interviewed Scott briefly.
And then they got out
this pile of clothes...
and made him, like,
take off his Converse...
and put on their tennis shoes.
And take off his flannel shirt,
wear their flannel shirt...
and then put, you know,
in the caption below...
"Flannel shirt, $85".
Who didn't
get a flannel shirt...
for Christmas
from their relatives?
And you tie it
around your waist...
and you run off
and do a stage dive.
All across America.
But up here, because
it's logger territory...
all these goonballs just
wear flannel anyways...
and then that's what became
the stereotype here.
You go around, you know,
to cities everywhere...
and you see some real...
stereotypical grungies,
you know...
with the Pearl Jam shirt...
and, you know,
with the stocking cap...
and, you know, the really neat
long johns with the shorts...
and you just say,
"I spit on you!"
Mannequins in stores...
with, like, long johns
and shorts for, like, $300.
- It's like we dress...
- We got 'em fooled.
We wear long johns up here
because it's fucking cold.
When Seventh Avenue decided
that grungewear...
was something
they'd put on the runways...
and that they thought it would
be an absolute knock-over...
yes, that any of my clients...
would be in their fashion shows
and be in their fashion layouts.
And when "Vanity Fair"
did a spread...
with people like Joan Rivers
wearing grungewear...
that was the only moment
for me, so far...
that came close to unbearable.
It was our thing.
Then, all of a sudden...
it belonged to people
who you never thought...
you were sharing
your music with.
Mainstream periodicals
and fashion magazines.
And you start realizing...
there's a whole lot
of people out there...
making money
by selling the idea...
of this Seattle scene
or grunge or whatever.
It's so profitable.
It's so profitable.
And they'll just keep taking
and taking and taking...
and they just don't know
how to restrain themselves.
You know, they're frothing
at the mouth over this.
And the bands aren't.
I mean, the bands aren't
really in it for dough.
I mean, they just aren't.
That would... if they were...
that would tip over the music.
Like, already
it's obvious that you see...
the Seattle scene has become
a marketed commodity.
But that's what makes
pop culture...
so significant to...
all the little consumers
out there.
They have no interest
in history or economics...
or science or art.
They're kind of interested
more in gossip...
the nature of celebrity...
and that's not at all
encouraging to find out that...
you participate
in that society.
One way or the other.
# I wonder why I do
the things I do
# One plus one has always
meant more than two
# Happy, and then content
# Change the channel
and now I'm bent
# On leaving you
# Yeah
# On leaving you
# On leaving you, you
# Yeah
# On leaving you, you, yeah
# Yeah yeah yeah ##
The bands get all big...
and then everybody
starts to like 'em.
And then they just
become so overplayed...
and kind of sold-out,
and I just...
I get out of them.
- That really pisses me off.
- Why?
Well, I liked them first.
When you hear a song
that's a great song...
played a million times,
you never want to hear it again.
If I hear that song
one more time...
if I see that guy's face
one more time...
I'm gonna fuckin'
find out his address...
and kill that motherfucker.
I don't blame them.
I've said it myself.
There definitely is the idea
that success is bad...
and that's part
of the rebellion.
That's part of the rebellion
against the eighties...
you know, our peers,
and our parents.
That we didn't really want
to become successful...
because with that comes
the trappings of responsibility.
It seemed for a while
that, like, celebrity...
was not really what you
wanted once you got it.
And yet you look at any
of these people...
that are now complaining
about being too much...
in the spotlight...
or always, you know,
scrutinized by everyone.
What did you expect?
I think a lot of people
whine about it...
but secretly they kind of
are excited about it, too.
I don't think that people
ever can imagine...
what is gonna go along
with being popular.
I don't think... no matter
what somebody tells you...
it's gonna be like...
I think it's a lot different
once you get there.
I think so, too.
Maybe we should try to find out.

I kind of figured
you play guitar...
or drums, whatever, sing,
make a record, play a show.
If people like your record,
they like your show.
I couldn't really
anticipate it becoming...
interviews and videos
and photo sessions.
Sort of in the forefront
of our minds...
we knew that these were things
that went along with the job.
But you never really
can anticipate it...
until you're there.
It's like, fuck, I can do
without the fame stuff...
and just, you know,
give me the money.
# Is it to the sky?
# To the sky
# To the sky

You have
a favorite band, right?
And you think,
why isn't this band enormous?
You know, the world
is just not a very...
you know,
it's just an unjust place.
And then you have a band
that you know is amazing...
and, suddenly,
everybody else in the world...
knows that they're amazing
and wants to get at them...
and write about them
and, you know...
you start wondering if success
is really a good thing...
because it sort of
makes people psycho.
It's nothing to strive for.
It's actually like...
this kind of success...
or trying to fulfill
this kind of hype.
It can destroy everything.
It can destroy what's real,
which is, like, music to you.
Or what's real,
which is your life.
You know? It can destroy it.
You know, it can make it, uh,
a commodity.
At whose cost?
At yours.
At your life and,
you know, your music.
They'll, you know...
take it all away from you.
And you're supposed
to be happy about it...
because you're successful.
# Now, you kissed me once,
and you kissed me twice
# With your messed up
slobbering lips
# With dribble in my brow
# I wait until you turned
# And I wiped it
on my pant leg
# Oh, now I'll sign this paper
for everyone to see
# Now I'm up here singin'
for everyone to hear
# Now I'll sign this paper
for everyone to see
# Now I'm up here singin'
for everyone to hear
# You
# Especially you
# It's all for you
# It's because of you
# My lungs are filled
with smoke
# Eyes light and hazy
from too many tears
# Red and glossy
from too many beers
# And my stomach shapes
into one big knot
# My stomach shapes
into one big knot ##
When you're in a band...
and it progresses from
being in the basement...
and learning how to play...
and then you go on
to more and more steps...
and that's a natural
progression of a band.
And you can see that.
That's a good thing.
It's all fine.
But then, you get
to this point where...
you're looking backwards
and you're, like...
"Well, maybe it was
better back then".
Well, imagine you're a band.
You're making music for fun...
because you like
writing your own songs...
You like playing your own songs.
You like playing
to your friends...
and having them clap and,
you know, having a good time...
and getting up
and jumping around a stage...
and, you know,
crashing into people.
And suddenly,
every publication...
and all the media in the world
wants to get at you.
Suddenly, people everywhere
you go recognize you.
They want your autograph.
Suddenly, your life as a private
individual is over with.
And that's probably a pretty
heavy thing to deal with.
What it looks like is,
wow, if you want to be...
really successful,
do heroin.
But, what I see is,
I saw people...
who were making
really good music...
suddenly have, like, this
overwhelming need for money.
It's just
fucking heartbreaking...
to see how disillusioned
people get, to where they...
that escape
is so sought after.
I think the first hint of it
was when Andy Wood died.
When you started thinking,
this is really sad...
because this guy had
a great future in front of him.
He was a really wonderful guy.
Funniest guy. The only...
the only rock 'n' roll stand-up
comic in Seattle was Andy Wood.
And we thought...
man, you know, they haven't
even become stars yet...
and already he's a casualty.
There's Kurt
on New Year's Day, '93.
This was the shoot for
the cover of the "Advocate".
And I really liked
this photo of Kurt.
We were just talking and I was
just picking the camera up...
occasionally and...
and photographing him.
It's rare to see a picture
where he's emoting...
or doing something
with his hands...
other than in his pocket.
And I really like this one.
# The river rise... #
Symbolically, perhaps,
it represented...
the death of something.
I mean, I know when...
I was... it affected me
in such a way...
that I was seriously
tempted to give up everything...
and go be a farmer
or something.
It was just
so disillusioning to me.
It was hard.
I didn't take it well.
# 'Cause I could fall
like a tear
# Nothing else I can do
# But I'm not alone
# Nothing's beside me
# All I see is
# The others blinded
# But I could fall
# As if I was young
# Ooh, with a lifetime
to think of you ##
If all this influence that this
part of the country has...
in this musical scene has...
if it doesn't
do anything with it...
that would be the tragedy.
If it doesn't do
something with it...
like, make some kind of change...
or make some kind
of difference...
this group of people
who feels this certain way...
this group of people who,
like, thinks these things...
that the underdogs we've all met
and lived with think...
if they finally
get to the forefront...
and nothing comes of it,
that would be the tragedy.
# Restless soul

To actually be this close...
to a pop culture explosion
has been really fascinating.
I mean, all of a sudden,
you can understand...
what happened in
San Francisco in '66 and '67.
You can understand
what happened in England...
during the punk thing.
And during
the Mersey Beat era.
And the subsequent stuff
that happened in London.
I mean, all of a sudden,
you can see...
how ridiculous
the whole goddamn thing is.
I mean, it's utterly absurd.
I mean...
It's so funny that they call it
"the Seattle scene"...
because it all grew
out of the region.
Everybody doing what they loved
because they love it.
And it doesn't matter
if they're from Bellingham...
Portland, Olympia.
You had people
who were in bands...
because they want
to be in bands...
who started record labels...
because they liked
their friends' bands...
and they wanted
to put out a record.
Fanzines because no one
was covering...
the kind of music
that they heard.
And all this was allowed to grow
without any other force...
coming in and disturbing that.
# All that's sacred
# Comes from youth
# Dedication
# Naive and true
# With no power
# Nothing to do
# I still remember
# Why don't you?
# Don't you?
# This is not for you
# This is not for you
# This is not for you
# Oh, never was for you
# Fuck you,
this is not for you
# Oh, never was for you
# Yeah ##
I didn't think I'd be making
a living at doing this.
I mean, I had no idea
that these bands...
were going to become
so popular, so famous.
I would have taken a lot
more photographs of them...
if I had known.
Our first U.S. tour was
a total failure, you know?
We didn't make
more than 90 bucks...
at any show in the whole U.S.
It's like, they hated us
everywhere we went.
But we're doing basically
the same thing...
we were doing in '85,
and now people like us.
I don't know why!
Let me put things
in perspective for you.
Five years ago...
This is a sleepy little
coastal fishing village.
Now, could we have the camera
pan out to the skyline, here?
This kind of
economic development...
is directly related
to what John and I...
have done to promote Seattle.
That's what's become of the
great punk rock party house...
of the mid-eighties.
It's so harsh.
It used to be this
tiny little shack...
like, set way back
in these terrible...
like, big weeds in the middle of
these beautiful homes.
And now... look,
it is a beautiful home.
I would love to, in about
twenty years from now...
be playing in, like,
some kind of, like...
super-loungey soul band
with a horn section.
We'll probably all be playing
in R&B bands in Pioneer Square.
Probably the same R&B band
on Pioneer Square.
# L'il sister, don't you... ##
Wow! What did I do right
in a past life or whatever...
that I get to do this with
my three really good friends?
I get to be in a band and
make music with these people.
It's a really
incredible experience.
We just play music
when we can...
and do shows and record
when we have songs.
And every now and then
we find out...
Seattle got really famous.
And we didn't.
And that's not too bad.
That's OK.
