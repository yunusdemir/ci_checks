THE SWAMP
Thank you, God,
for giving me Isabel.
Thank you, God,
for giving me Isabel.
Who's Joaquin with in the mountains?
Vero.
Vero.
- Move over.
- What's wrong?
I don't want anyone but Isabel.
Mom's firing her, Momi.
Why?
She says sheets and towels
are disappearing.
She's firing her.
It's a lie.
Mechita.
Get up. It's gonna rain.
Okay, I'm getting up. I'm fine.
Momi!!
Mecha fell down.
I don't want to see blood, Momi.
I'll get up myself.
Put her in the chair.
Let me go.
Don't make a fuss.
Stop it.
So here are all the towels.
Momi, bring the car around.
Let me go!
She's crushing the hydrangeas.
Stop her.
Let me go, Isabel!
Tell the gringo doctor she's coming.
Your mom's losing a lot of blood.
Momi, go get my dress with buttons.
This savage wants to take me
to the Swamp like this.
We've gotta take her to the hospital.
She's losing a lot of blood.
Go see what Isabel took.
Don't put the towels in hot water.
They'll stain.
What's going on?
It's all dirty.
I can't wear this.
- Don't make me.
- It's raining. Get in the car.
It will do the land good.
Come on.
- No, Gregorio.
- Vero, I'll go.
Do as I say, Veronica.
- Let me go, please.
- Don't let him drive.
What if I'm stopped?
Say you forgot your license
and that it's serious.
It is serious.
Isabel, the gate!
Isa, the gate.
It's the age.
My mom-in-law
was always like that.
She's not blind.
She should travel,
but she doesn't want to.
- There are so many cultures.
- I'm going to the fair.
Isn't it raining?
So many-
Not that far, but -
Look at the hare in the sink.
No. Rafael has so much work,
we're stuck here all year.
Where?
Bolivia?
Who'd you go with?
Alone, with the kids?
That's daring.
Colorful costumes?
Very colorful.
Too gaudy.
Nothing you could wear.
Really gorgeous.
But not to wear.
Stop that!
And were you held up at customs?
My mother-in-law should go,
but she's blind.
- They soaked us.
- We didn't want to play.
Girls, please. Hang on.
What is it? I'm talking.
- Tell them off, Mom.
- Carnival begins, and so do the problems.
I'll call you later.
What happened, Luchi?
Let's see.
You cut yourself.
Girls, I can't think straight.
Agustina, come and help.
Take him to the bathroom.
Wash it carefully.
We'll pour water on it
to stop the bleeding.
- It's okay.
- Rafael?
Can you take Luchi to see the gringo?
He cut himself again.
No, nothing serious.
Tali, this won't defrost.
Get some chicken.
The beef was frozen solid.
Okay. Bye.
Careful. It's hot.
DoctorJohn, the surgeon
We must operate today
In the emergency ward
A girl of your age
She is 2 1 years old
You are one year older
Who's this girl?
Veronica. But at home
they call her Verito.
She lives four days with her mom
and three with her dad.
Her dad lives in an apartment.
Her mom kept the house.
- That's nice. Poor thing.
- Other way around.
My mom has the apartment.
My dad has the house.
Same thing.
Hello?
Agustina, it's for you.
Ayoung man.
Hello?
It's my dad. Yes, Dad.
They're leaving now.
Okay. Bye.
Are you all right?
Are you crying?
It sounded like it.
I don't know if I can go.
There's a lot of work.
It's raining there, isn't it?
I can hear it.
- I don't know.
- Who is it?
- Vero.
- Vero who?
My sister.
Hello.
Yes, I can hear you.
How many stitches did they give her?
Did you have to give blood?
What happened?
-Jose.
- Is Mom all right?
- Are they both at the clinic?
-Jose, what happened?
My mom had an accident,
but she's all right.
What?
Tali, you know Mecha?
Yes. She's almost a cousin.
Poor Mecha.
Is she badly hurt?
A bit drunk.
Poor Mecha.
I don't know what's wrong.
This isn't anything new,
but she'd stopped.
Obviously not.
- What happened?
- Nothing.
Rosa, tell the gringo to hurry.
My house is in chaos.
Yes, Tali.
- What happened, Mom?
- What happened?
When I tell you to listen,
you have to listen.
If Mecha had listened to her mom,
she'd never have married that man.
- I always listen.
- I know.
It's back on, thank God. No.
- On top of everything else.
- Damn rain.
- Want to stay over?
- Yes.
Who'll stay with Mecha?
- Momi's coming.
- All right, then.
Tali, has he had a tetanus shot?
Damn! I left the vaccine at home.
Did we vaccinate you?
- Did we?
- Yes, we did.
We did. Are you sure?
- Bye, Gringo. Thanks.
- Bye.
- Will he need stitches?
- Yes, but don't worry.
Luchi.
What's in your mouth?
It's a new tooth coming in.
Close it.
- May I see Mecha?
- No.
We had to pump her stomach
to give her tranquilizers.
- She must be asleep.
- Poor Mecha.
- Better tomorrow.
- Tomorrow, then.
- Gregorio was no better.
- Was he hurt too?
No,just drunk.
Couldn't even give blood.
Good God! What a family.
I've been here two hours
and haven't seen anything.
But that's the owner's home.
Nilda.
Look, there it is.
I can't see a thing.
- Did you see the Virgin?
- Well, not me. My daughter.
- Is she in?
- Yes, I'll call her.
Miriam, they want to ask you
some questions.
- You saw the Virgin?
- Yes, ma'am.
- How?
- I was hanging out the wash,
and I saw a light on the water tank.
I looked up and saw the Virgin.
Had you seen her before?
Just this once.
Close up or far away?
Medium.
I was in the yard
and saw her on the tank.
Anyone want to comment?
I came because my niece saw her.
But I can't.
Mom says you have to answer.
- Do you pray or sing?
- We pray.
Hello.
Hi, dirty Momi.
Yes, I know what happened.
Vero called me. Is she back?
Remember, it's long distance.
- Shall I open up?
- No, that's worse.
Hello.
Tell Vero I'll be there tomorrow.
Tell Vero I'll be there tomorrow.
Turn the TV down. I can't hear.
Who's with you?
Put Isabel on.
He didn't believe.
- He had to see it to believe.
- Hi,Jose.
There were lots of people.
- You saw the Virgin?
- Yes, with Pablo.
He was ecstatic.
- Where are you going?
- Your brother wants me to go.
Jose, don't be bossy!
Isa, he says he's sorry.
Isa, come back.
And Mom?
She's spending the night at the clinic.
Is she okay?
She wants a nightgown,
and she wants you to take her
her dress with buttons
and a towel.
And Vero?
She's sleeping over at Tali's.
How can I go?
Take the car.
I don't have a license.
I told you, you should get one.
Dad, I'm 1 5.
Damn it, Momi.
The road's deserted.
If you're stopped, say I sent you.
Tell Isabel to go with you.
- Look up there.
- It's not there.
Over there, maybe.
Look how these are.
I'll take that T-shirt just the same.
How long are you going for?
A few days.
Is it serious?
We have so much work this week.
If you're not back in a few days,
maybe I should go too.
I could talk to Mecha.
They never deliver the peppers on time.
There's no need.
I can talk to Dad and fix everything,
so you don't have to go.
Gregorio! Fat chance.
Maybe, it's too much for two days.
Go sleep in your room.
It's too hot.
I'll be right back.
Would this fitJose?
What size is he?
- Perro's outside.
- Call him so he can try it on.
Here's Perro.
- What are you doing here?
- Working with my cousin.
Try this on. It's forJose.
- He's bigger than me.
- I know. It's just to check.
Medium.
Fine.
Bye.
What size are the gray trousers?
Whose turn is it?
- I can't open it.
- Let's see.
It's locked. Can't be opened.
Let's go back to town
and call them to open it.
Sure they invited you?
Things work the same everywhere.
Rafael, we could put
a pool in the back.
-Just for cooling off.
- Of course.
Your house is too small.
Step on the clutch.
There. That's it.
Poor Mecha. Where will it end?
Gregorio's always been
such a ladies' man.
- Slow down. That's it.
- She knew about Mercedes,
but she turned a blind eye.
Not in front of the children.
Yes, because otherwise
it'll be worse later.
History repeats itself.
I always thought Mecha knew
he and Mercedes -
Gregorio's married to Mecha
and he's going out with another girl?
Before. Now -
- Apparently.
- Which Mercedes?
Careful. Watch the road.
Mercedes, the one
who works with Jose in Buenos Aires.
- Weren't you all close friends?
- That's just it.
Turn here and stop slowly.
That's it.
What's he doing standing there?
Nothing, of course.
He's just standing there.
What's the problem?
That guy was never any use.
I guess I've got to get out.
- How are you?
- Fine. You?
Hello, Rafael. How are you?
- I brought the kids.
- How are you, Gregorio?
So they can use the pool.
- Lovely day.
- Hope it stays this way.
- I'll pick them up this evening.
- Gregorio dyed his hair.
Isa.
We came to see.
They say that the Virgin appeared
on that water tank.
But we didn't see anything.
But it appears to be
here in this house,
by the small tank
on the small ledge
where the cement tank sits.
They say they saw her
right there in the center.
That's where she stands.
We'll stay a while.
We'll wait all night,
until 3:00 in the morning.
We're very anxious
to see the Virgin.
Look at my cleavage.
What a mess.
Where are you going?
To see my sister.
And that dress?
Going to carnival?
How can you, when Mom's ill?
Momi, why don't you go to the pool?
It's hot.
Party animal!
Momi, dirty Momi.
I'll get you, Momi.
Come here.
No!
Her cousin found a dog
in the street.
A tiny short-haired one.
It looked abandoned,
so she took it home.
She left it with her cats and fed it.
The next day,
she gets up to feed it again.
The dog is covered in blood,
and the cats are gone.
She takes the dog,
washes and dries it off,
and takes it to the nearest vet.
She tells the vet,
""Doctor, I think this dog ate my cats.''
""Put it on the bed.''
The vet turns and takes an ax
hanging on the wall
and cuts the dog in half.
The woman gets up close and sees
it has loads of teeth, two rows.
The vet says,
""That's not a dog, ma'am.
It's an African rat.''
What are you taking?
What's in your hand?
I didn't steal it.
I just put it there.
I didn't steal it, Isa.
Come here.
Why don't you take a bath?
You haven't bathed in four days.
And that pool's filthy.
You can't swim in it.
You'll catch something nasty.
Here, put this on.
- It doesn't match.
- Yes, it does.
- Not stripes and flowers.
- Yes, Momi. Go on.
When Joaquin goes to the mountains,
I'm frightened for his other eye.
Go get the kids
from the mountains.
If they're not ready when Tali comes,
she'll stay and chat for hours.
- Get out of there, Luchi.
- Luciano!
Out of the way.
These priests are very organized.
They make such a mess.
I got a list of stuff
the kids need for school.
They even need nylon thread.
I wonder.
- What can they learn with that?
- Nothing.
- Want a drink?
- No.
Something cool, with ice.
Okay, something cool.
- Some ice with -
- Mamina.
Mamina!
- Yes, ma'am.
- Get some cool drinks.
Glasses, ice and some wine.
Teresa went shopping in Bolivia.
She went over,
and for two pesos she got everything,
from gym shoes to pencils.
Tali, why don't we take a little trip?
To Bolivia, the two of us.
- To shop.
- Yes, why not?
Teresa can suggest a hotel.
She got everything.
- From pencils to gym shoes.
- It's worth it.
There's never enough money with kids.
And there's Joaquin's operation too.
That's right.
You know Joaquin. Nothing troubles him.
But this year,
he'll start going dancing.
Pour me a bit.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
- And the parties.
- Oh, yes.
His eye will be a problem.
What did the gringo say?
The gringo said,
he'd need surgery
two years after the accident.
It's almost four years now.
Yes, Mom was still alive.
The gringo says it'll look perfect.
But he has to take out his eye
and put in an artificial one
to hide the cavity.
- Amazing.
- He hates the glass eye.
- He says they'll call him One Eye.
- No, they won't.
On Thursday,
I'm taking Luchi to the dentist.
He's got a tooth growing
in his palate.
- This girl's prettier every day.
- Her hairs all knotted.
It's fine, like silk.
It's beautiful.
Tali wants to go to Bolivia
this weekend.
- We want to go and buy things for school.
- Already?
- The kids are in the pool.
- Fine.
Can't they stay a few more days?
It's fine by me, sweetheart.
Yes, let's turn the lights on.
The problem is Rafael hates
not having the kids around.
- He has no one to talk to.
- But we'll be back soon.
Why not come visit us
so your mom can rest?
I hardly hear them.
- How would you? You're in bed all day.
- Shut up, dirty savage!
Tali says we're going shopping in Bolivia.
We could ask Rafael for the car, right?
Don't worry.
We'll find something.
It's Jose.
- What a handsome son, Mecha.
- Unlike his dad.
- Did you see the Virgin?
- I haven't had time to go.
Teresa went.
She said it was incredible.
She was transformed.
She phoned me in tears.
""You have to see it
to understand, Tali,'' she said.
- Teresa likes being everywhere.
- Yes, she does.
She went at the beginning
and saw her very clearly.
It was packed,
but Teresa pushed through
and slowly made her way
right up to the house
and saw her on the tank.
The Virgin of Carmen,
with scapular and robe
just like in the image.
- You know Dr. Mauro's wife?
- Yes.
She saw Our Lady of Mercy
with Jesus and the guardian angels.
And she's Jewish.
It must be true.
Jews don't go around seeing things.
We each see what we can.
I heard of another apparition
in a blue robe
with golden rays
coming from her hands.
What a clown!
That's right, dance!
Come on. Let's go.
- How lovely.
- Am I staying?
Yes, sweetie.
But Luchi, you come along.
The dentist has to see
that extra tooth of yours.
Where are your clothes?
- Come on, Luchito.
- Vacation's ending.
But when you grow up
with nice teeth, you'll thank me.
- Bye, Martin.
- Let's see your teeth.
No, another time.
Come on. Are you wet?
Don't show your father.
He'll start fussing.
Jose, help me.
I'll change him in the car.
Okay. Bye.
What a heavy kid.
Don't forget anything.
What's wrong?
I thought we'd agreed
the kids wouldn't stay.
- So why did they?
- It'll be okay.
- We'll pick them up tomorrow.
- They'll be okay. Don't scare me.
That house is a disaster.
You know whose fault it is?
Your cousin's.
She should have thrown him out.
Poor Mecha.
She'll end up like her mother,
who went to bed one day
and never got up till she died
1 5 or 20 years later.
We might go to Bolivia
next weekend with Mecha.
School things are cheaper there.
- I can't go.
- No, we're going alone.
With the kids.
- When I go hunting with Martin,
- Why not?
- It's always no!
- he won't lend me his rifle.
He'll lend it to you in time.
You're still little.
What do we need?
Luchi, I told you not to get wet.
Now look.
Do we need papers?
Careful, Mariana.
Do we need papers
to cross the border?
Don't you have them?
What papers do we need?
I'm sick of these natives
hammering all night,
never letting anyone sleep.
It's not a good time for a trip.
It's too dangerous for two women.
Teresa went and nothing happened.
Mecha's a drunk
and all stitched up.
So? Nothing'll happen.
It's two or three days at most.
Why go so far
when you can buy it all here?
- It's cheaper.
- No, it's more expensive.
Want more?
Here.
Mom.
How -
Do African rats exist?
Leave the light on, Dad.
There's a huge rat.
It's okay.
How revolting.
Let me see.
Go on.
It's all bloody.
Agus -
What?
What?
We won't move you.
Go to sleep.
His clothes are all dirty.
- What did they do?
- They took an X-ray.
Now we have to wait for it to grow.
What did they do to your mouth?
I hate that noise!
Look at the X-ray.
Let me see. Open wide.
Are the kids coming back today?
I'll go get them when they call.
I don't like them being there.
How many times do I have to say it?
That's killing me.
- They'll be home this weekend?
- Yes.
There's a pool there.
They get bored in the house.
I'll buy a pool for the yard.
Your house is too small.
Stop putting that in your mouth.
Take that eraser out.
Let's go.
Hello.
- You going to the dam?
- Yes.
They don't know about last night.
They want to go to the dam.
Let's go.
What a pig you turned out to be.
Someone answer the phone!
Answer the phone!
Same old story.
It rings and rings.
Who is it?
Who?
The phone, Mamina.
Mercedes who?
Mercedes, how are you?
These Indians never answer the phone.
No, don't worry.
I'm fine. It was just a little scare.
My blood pressure dropped.
I don't know.
What? Jose.
Wait a minute.
Just a second.Jose!
He went partying.
Now he's at the dam, I guess.
Yes.
He must be out.
I'll tell him to call you.
Really?
When are you coming?
Mamina.
Get me some ice.
When are you coming?
Fine.
You can get a little rest too.
Okay.
Okay. Bye, Mercedes.
Ah, you were here after all.
I don't have a swimsuit.
There!
One, two, three, four...
1 5, 1 6, 1 7...
...25, 26.
Now it will grow straight.
The dog next door barks and jumps
against the wall. He might break it.
Who?
- The dog next door.
- Break the wall?
It can't. The wall's thick.
I think it's real big.
- The dog?
- Yes.
Luciano, you're dead!
Drop dead!
Get up.
Pass me the hammer.
Look at me.
What's in your mouth?
You hiding something? Open up.
- Lots of teeth are coming in.
- Where? It's only one.
Open up.
Breathe.
- Don't do that.
- It's a dog-rat.
Get down from there!
You're scaring your brother.
Careful.
Now go play somewhere else.
I said you're not allowed
to get on the ladder.
Luchi, come and help me.
Let's move it here.
Joaquin, your fish.
Thanks.
- You gonna cook them?
- What, this shit?
It's all mud.
Indians eat any shit.

- It's nothing.
""It's nothing,'' and then one of you
shows up one day without an eye!
Joaca.
Eat properly.
Don't be a pig,Joaca.
Did you call Mercedes?
Did you call her,Jose?
What?
Did you call Mercedes?
No.
She called today.
Needed some information
about customs.
She's coming for a few days.
I guess she'll stay here.
I'll stay in bed till she leaves.
I can't stand her.
Yes, she's unbearable,
but she sells peppers,
unlike other people.
- Did you have fun at the pool?
- The pool's been filthy for years.
- Oh, that's right.
- Your hair's filthy.
The filter doesn't work,
the pump doesn't work-
nothing works.
Leave that.
-Joaca, eat properly.
- Go on.
What is it?
- Fish stew.
- It's good.
It is, but...
go light on the peppers
for me for a while.
Isabel, bring me some peaches, please.
Hello,Jose.
Hi, Mercedes. It's Jose.
I'm at home. I'll call you later.
Mechita.
Go get a cool drink.
Get off, Vero.
Is Mercedes coming?
I think so.
You love her?
Go to your room.
Out!
Here, have a little more.
Look, Gregorio.
Tomorrow Isabel will take
your things to the back room.
I'd like you to move there.
- Mecha, what about the kids?
- Starting tonight.
- What will the kids say?
- And another thing.
Stop dying your hair.
It's ruining the sheets.
Are you doing that for carnival?
Careful with the dogs!
Let them go.
Let it go, bloody Indian!
- Don't pat them. It makes them tame.
- It doesn't.
- I said don't pat them.
- One's stuck up there.
Go and get it.
Hurry up! Go get it!
It's not a dog-rat.
We can get out.
Don't look. He's dyed his hair.
It's not as bad as I thought.
Without the bandages,
in just a couple days...
Hello, Tali.
- How are you?
- Fine.
- Fine? And the kids?
- Fine.
I'm glad.
I'll take that.
Mercedes is coming.
Really? When?
I don't know.
She's so brilliant.
Remember at college?
Always taking notes.
Kids are so lucky nowadays
with photocopies.
Is she with someone?
- She never sleeps alone.
- Poor thing.
Answer the phone!
Answer the phone, Isabel!
They never understand.
Why ""poor thing''?
She always had lots of admirers
and suitors, remember?
Even so,
it was always a bunch of-
Almost all scoundrels.
She's always had a weakness for idiots.
Pity I realized it too late.
That's a shame.
Shame you can't come,
'cause the weather's great.
I'm staying a few more days.
I'll be back in Buenos Aires
in a few days.
There are things to fix in the house.
The electricity and -
Have you got my towel?
This one's yours.
- Guess what?
- What?
Mercedes isn't coming.
Jose.
Give me my panties.
Look!
Those Indians must have fucked her.
You can't trust them for a minute.
They like dogs.
They like their hair.
It's so soft.
They're so rough,
and they live on top of each other.
Father, mother, grandfather,
cat, dogs.
Did you see how
they're always patting them?
They fondle them all day.
Ask Gringo to do
some good plastic surgery.
- It's a shame. I so love low necklines.
- It'll hardly show.
There's great plastic surgery now.
Teresa had it after her cesarean.
- Though cesareans are more hidden.
- What lovely hands.
First I have to worry
about eye surgery forJoaquin.
Look after yourself a bit more.
These worthless kids leave such a mess.
I'm always tripping over-
What did you trip over
the other day, Mom?
A towel. Didn't you know?
Although with Isabel,
towels are hard to come by these days.
- She doesn't steal towels.
- Don't answer back!
Dirty savage.
She spends all day with the maid.
Look at her hair!
- You were all drunk.
- Shut up!
Don't listen.
All she does is torture me.
Get out!
- A bit of sun will heal it.
- Sun, Tali? In this heat.
I know how this will end.
You'll stay in your room
like Grandma.
Get out!
If I want to stay in bed, I will!
Let's go to Bolivia
this weekend, Tali. Okay?
All right.
I'll sort out the papers.
We'll rest, get some fresh air.
The road's a bit dangerous, but -
It'll be fine. We can walk.
I'll find those papers.
What if I do end up like Mom?
Kids, get those dogs out of here.
Come on, let's get going.
Ready?
My towel's missing.
Look at you,Jose.
Go wash up!
Find him a towel.
Look. Mecha has a dog-rat.
Where's Isabel?
- My towel's in the bathroom.
- Go and look.
For heaven's sake, kids!
- We have to go.
- It's a dog-rat.
Take it off.
The bed will be full of germs.
Get out.
Get out.
Get out.
Leave that dog.
Leave it.
- Forget anything?
- Let's take it.
Let's go.
Faster. They're catching us.
That poor one-eyed boy
is gonna fall down.
Are they gone?
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to walk.
- I'll take you.
- No, it's okay.
I'll take you in Gregorio's van.
Wait here.
- Dad?
- What?
After you wash my legs,
can you wash my hair?
Look. I found them.
Aren't these the car papers?
Pass me a towel.
From where?
No, a rag.
No, clean her off with this.
I'll wash it later.
Are these the papers
we need for the border?
- Put them where you found them.
- In a minute.
Look at you.
That's why the house is so dirty.
Do they ask for these papers
at the border?
You shouldn't go there.
You get all dirty.
Mom said I could.
Pass me the detergent.
You're a mess.
Luciano too.
Something exploded.
The bulb went.
Get out or the smoke will -
Where's Perro?
- What did he do to you?
- Nothing, Momi.
- What did he do?
- Stay here.
- Is the owner home?
- Yes, she is.
Ma'am,
has the Virgin reappeared?
My daughter says the Virgin
asks us to pray a lot
because hard times are coming.
May we speak with your daughter?
No, she's very tired.
Miriam, how are you?
Did you see the Virgin again?
Phone! Answer the phone!
She's tired of all the people.
She doesn't want to see anyone.
That's the truth.
She doesn't want to talk.
Has she appeared again?
Very well.
At this intersection
in the suburb of San Francisco,
something worries us.
Now you answer.
Isabel, hang up!
Hello?
Mercedes, these Indians
never tell me who's calling. What?
Yes.
I don't know if he's up.
Just a minute.
Wait, I'll try to transfer the call.
Damn phone.
- Hello,Jose?
- No, it's me, Mecha.
- Okay, Mecha.
-Just a second, because -
This phone's a piece of junk.
Come here.
Can you work this phone?
- Who is it?
- For you.
You're always either out or asleep.
Yes, Mecha.
Yes, Mercedes.
Yes, Mecha's fine.
Yes, she's fine.
Don't worry.
Okay. Big kiss.
I gotta go back to Buenos Aires.
Get some rest, son.
- It's mine.
- No. It's mine.
Kids, stop fighting and get in.
- That's my pencil.
- No. It's mine.
Here, take this. What is it?
They're mine.
What are those?
Let your brother have those.
Let's see, Mariana.
What's this?
- How nice. Where did you get this?
- Back there.
- What is it?
- School stuff.
What stuff?
For school. What else?
Give it to me.
When did you buy all this?
Why didn't you tell me?
I don't know.
Who gave Rafael the list?
Agustina.
You've already bought everything.
Why didn't you tell me?
Take the box out, Mariana.
- I can't.
- Take it out!
Luciano, help me.
Are you asleep, Isabel?
Are you asleep?
Momi.
Go pick up a box
that arrived for Mecha.
- Go on. Take the car.
- I can't. I'm busy. AskJose.
Can you hear me?
- Go pick up the fridge. I need the car.
- I'm not going.
Stay a while longer.
Luciano, what color labels do you want?
Blue, red, burgundy.
- Pale blue?
- Yes.
- Name and surname?
- Luciano Echenique.
Class?
First grade, section A.
First grade is easy.
Second is harder.
Luciano, breathe.
Breathe, Luciano.
Breathe, Luciano.
Breathe.
Breathe.
I'm gonna call Mecha.
I'm gonna call her right now.
I'll tell her we're not going.
Besides, it's dangerous.
We'll call Mecha and tell her
it's a waste of time going to Bolivia.
We'll avoid complications.
It won't stop raining.
What if something happened
on the way?
And with no papers for the car.
- Going to Bolivia is a waste of money.
- We'd spend too much.
Rafael bought it all wholesale.
It was dirt cheap.
We'd end up spending more.
We'll say it's a shame we can't go.
He bought everything?
- What an extraordinary man you've got.
- Hey, kids.
- While I'm here with...
- Pass me the pillow.
We can go later on, of course.
Okay.
Bye, Tali.
Isn't he sleeping here anymore?
It's impossible in this heat.
The healing process
raises my temperature.
There's never any ice.
God, I hate this climate.
Stop it, asshole.
Kids!
I don't feel well.
Stop it.
Ma'am, may I talk to you?
Bring me some ice.
I have to go to my sister's.
Why didn't you tell me sooner?
For how long? I need you here.
I might have to stay there.
You'll have to find another girl.
I have to stay with her.
She asked me to.
I wonder why.
These party girls.
You give them everything:
a roof, food, everything.
And this is what you get.
They're all the same.
Ingrates. Then you have
to look after their kids.
God, what ingrates!
Move!
Go! I'll send for you
to settle your pay.
Just great.
Unbelievable.
Leave me alone.
- There it is.
- Where?
- Here. Listen.
- Here?
There it is.
Listen.
It's fading.
Stop that.
Call anyway.
No one may be home.
You can leave a message.
You call.
I don't know what to say.
No, I'll call some other time.
Hang up.
No need for you to come.
Stay here.
I'll call Tali and go.
Where did you go?
Where the Virgin's been appearing.
I didn't see anything.
