I was born in Yuma, Arizona,
on a ranch owned by my family.
But we lost it in the depression.
And, like many other families,
we moved to California
to work in the fields.
<i>When we arrived, we found out</i>
<i>that there was more
people than jobs.</i>
<i>And we went from being farm owners</i>
<i>to farm workers in one day.</i>
<i>And at the age of 11,</i>
<i>I started working in the fields.</i>
<i>And that's where I witnessed
for the first time</i>
<i>the injustice and the indignities</i>
<i>suffered by the farm workers.</i>
<i>You see, the problem
is that in 1936</i>
<i>the country changed</i>
<i>because the national labor
relations act went into effect</i>
and it gave most workers the
right to join the union
and bargain collectively,
except the farm workers.
They were excluded
from this protection.
And I was one of them.
I wanted to do something,
so I joined the CSO...
community service organization.
And that's where I learned
how to organize people.
<i>We were working in the cities.</i>
<i>And I realized that
to make a difference,</i>
<i>we had to get out and start
organizing the workers.</i>
<i>So in 1962</i>
<i>I went back to the
fields to do just that.</i>
Can I help you, sir?
Are you talking to those workers?
Is there something
I can do for you?
I'm talking to you.
If we want to organize farm
workers, if we're really serious,
it's not gonna happen
here, not with them.
It's just one setback, Cesar.
It takes a while to build trust.
You have to be patient.
Look, they really don't care
about the farm worker, Fred.
- Gilbert, that's not true.
- See, that's what I'm talking about, Fred.
See, I have to be where it's happening.
I have to get out of Los Angeles
and go back to the
fields where I started.
Okay, okay, you know, we're
doing this together, okay?
You knew this could happen.
That's why we have a plan.
- But not in an office.
- But it's not the time to walk out now.
You know what it takes.
It's why I brought you in.
The CSO will be behind
you, no matter what.
But, please, at least sleep on it.
I'm not tired, Fred.
I want to get my hands dirty.
- Cesar.
- I'm with him. He's right.
You'll go to new schools
and make new friends.
You're going to be fine.
Your father and I grew
up on the fields.
Which team plays for Delano?
Your tio Rook and tia
Petra live in Delano.
So do our cousins.
It's gonna be good.
<i>Okay, let's take a vote.</i>
Who wants to go to Delano?
<i>It's a wonderful day in
Southern California.</i>
Okay, no.
Stop. No.
Come on, I'm trying to
listen to the game.
Would you stop? Stop it.
<i>Top of the fourth, Dodgers
leading two to nothing.</i>
<i>Delivers and it's a long drive</i>
<i>down the left field...</i>
I can't hear. Can you turn it up?
I think we passed the signal.
You promised me a
three-bedroom house.
I said I would try, Mansi.
It was short notice.
- But I gave you two months.
- That's short notice.
- Uncle Cesar.
- That goes in the bedroom, Chato.
- It doesn't fit.
- It doesn't fit.
Hey, Cesar, we've lived in
a lot worse. We'll be fine.
Can you get the heavy stuff
in the truck, please?
You put eight kids in that one car.
You can put them in the house.
<i>We can find a bigger one
in a couple of months.</i>
<i>And then we gotta
move all over again?</i>
48, 49,
50, 51,
<i>52, 53.</i>
That's all for today.
I hear they're looking for
bodies at the Indian fields.
I found the same thing in Hanford.
The workers are scared.
Then we need to hold twice
as many house meetings
than we did in Selma.
- What's the matter?
- It's my back.
<i>Pinche viejito,</i>
<i>you can't take real work anymore.</i>
It hurts even when I don't work.
<i>You should take it easy.</i>
What, and live on just
what Helen makes?
Nah, we're gonna make the kids
work on the weekends now.
That's what Eloina was
telling the other girls:
What does he do when
he's not around?
<i>But she went and told
everybody at the church</i>
<i>and now everybody has an idea.</i>
Look who's here, and very dirty.
Did you walk here from Oxnard?
<i>- Hola.
- I thought maybe you weren't coming back.</i>
- It's only been two weeks.
- It's been 18 days.
18 days.
<i>- Hola, Petra.
- Cesar.</i>
<i>Dolores!</i>
Look at you.
Well, you definitely
got your hands dirty.
<i>This is Angela. Say, "hi, Cesar."</i>
<i>- Hey,mamita.
- I should put her to bed.</i>
How long are you guys visiting us?
Well, word is, you can't
do this without me, so...
You're staying?
Well, of course.
I'm gonna let you mess up
what you started here?
But before you do anything,
you need to go talk to Fernando.
I need to go talk to Fernando.
Okay.
Hi.
What happened to your eye?
Nothing.
You want to talk
about this nothing?
No.
The kids here are idiots.
They hate us, you know.
They came up on me and
Chato, a bunch of them.
They wouldn't stop
calling us "beaners."
"Beaners"?
Is that the best they got?
I've been called much worse.
"Greaser,"
"wetback,"
"spic."
That one doesn't even make sense.
"Brown nigger."
I never heard that one.
Oh, I learned a lot in the Navy.
Put this on your eye.
Who started it?
I told you, they started
calling us names.
No, who started the fight?
We didn't have a choice.
You always have a choice.
I knew you wouldn't get it.
<i>Although the official military word</i>
<i>is that these are only
mopping-up operations,</i>
<i>We need to bring the people
together, like a convention.</i>
<i>We need to get everybody
together in one place</i>
<i>so they can see how strong we are.</i>
- We should start a credit union.
- Loan people money?
Yeah, it'll give us credibility and
help people during the winter.
<i>Hey, remember me? Eli Ordonez.</i>
I saw you in Salinas at that
other meeting you were doing.
If you want, I can help
pass those around.
I have a cousin, but he
doesn't have the papers.
Well, you tell your cousin
if he works in the fields,
<i>he has the right to representation.</i>
Cesar Chavez.
<i>How much are you
asking for, Chucho?</i>
- $25.
- How about 10, Chucho?
Look at all these other
people who also want money.
Here people can put messages
to their family
or anyone. It's great.
Want to see the union paper?
Sheriff, every night this goes on.
And I have to tell my
husband to rush home
because I'm frightened of
what's going on over there.
We are decent folk and
don't want any trouble.
I'm terrified for my children.
And who knows...?
Okay, okay, ladies, ladies, let
me make sure I understand this.
You say they get
together every night.
- Every night.
- And there's 50 of them.
57. I count 57.
57.
Mr. Chavez!
- Yes?
- How are you doing today?
Fine. How can I help you?
I just wanted to introduce myself.
- I'm sheriff...
- I know who you are.
You seem to be gathering
quite a crowd.
Is there a law against that?
No, not really.
But I would like to ask
you some questions
about some of the people around you
and their affiliations.
Affiliations to what?
Let's say the communist party.
- Communist?
- Yeah.
<i>Él cree que somos comunistas.</i>
You mind telling me
what's so funny?
Sir, we're catholic.
How can catholics be communists?
I've seen stranger things.
Mr. Chavez, you mind if
we take a look around?
Do you have a warrant?
Not on me.
So you're asking me for a favor.
I think you'd be doing
yourself a favor.
Well, come in.
We have nothing to hide.
What are they doing here?
You giving away free
piñatas or something?
It's a credit union.
No shit. Where's the
money coming from?
Donations.
Here's the box if
you're interested.
I don't know exactly
what you're up to here,
but the citizens of Delano...
they don't care much
for subversives.
And they respect the law.
So do we,
especially the bill of rights.
Have you read the bill of rights?
Let's go.
<i>...in there.</i>
You have 10 minutes to
vacate the premises.
<i>You're now trespassing and will be
prosecuted to the full extent of the law.</i>
We're not moving!
<i>Is that you, Larry?</i>
Yeah. Yeah, it's me.
<i>Larry, you get your
people out of there now</i>
<i>and get back to work.
I'll forget everything...</i>
<i>no blacklisting, no nothing.</i>
Sorry, that's not good enough.
You cut our wages too goddamn much.
<i>We'll starve on what
you pay us anyhow.</i>
Go.
The growers cut their pay in half.
And now they've barricaded
themselves in the camps.
- This thing is blowing up.
- The Filipinos?
Yeah, and now the growers are recruiting
our people to break the strikes.
That's why Larry specifically
asked for you, Cesar.
He knows he can't win without us.
Oh, and by the way, who gives
a shit about the Filipinos?
You think they will strike for us?
They play the races against
each other. That's their tactic.
Are we a union or not?
<i>¡Huelga!</i>
<i>¡Huelga!</i>
<i>¡Huelga! ¡Huelga!</i>
- The growers are going to be...
- Larry, now that we're together,
- the growers are gonna have to change.
- I'm not worried about them.
My people are angry.
This thing's been building for
too long. It's ready to explode.
Everyone's angry. We just have
to manage our own people.
I have people from
Stockton to Coachella.
I never said it was gonna be easy,
but if you take care of your side,
I take care of mine, we'll be fine.
There's things we can't control.
There's things that
we have to control.
So who the hell is
this Cesar Chavez?
Nobody knows.
Somebody said he was from Arizona.
Word is he used to
hang around Alinsky
and the other commies from the CSO.
He's been up and down the
valley, stirring up trouble.
Yeah, I heard he's Mexican.
Seems a safe bet.
They've come out with this...
this newspaper.
<i>Got this beaner character
in there named Don Sotaco.</i>
<i>There he is.</i>
Kind of funny.
Well, it's a cartoon, but
I'm not sure it's funny.
Who cares? Most of our
workers are illiterate.
Yeah, but you can
understand a cartoon
without being able to read.
So this Don Sotaco...
he...
Informs the workers
about their rights.
And this is, what? A weekly?
Mm-hmm.
Thank God it isn't a daily.
Although 52 weeks a year...
that is a lot of rights, sheriff.
<i>- ¡Viva la huelga!
- ¡Viva!</i>
- Did they confirm?
- Of course.
- Anyone?
- Mostly local,
but some are actually coming down
from San Francisco, Arizona.
- Where are they?
- I don't know.
They should be here by now.
Get the hell off our property.
- Go back to Mexico!
- Stay calm.
- Get the hell out of here, dirty spics.
- Don't react.
- We don't need you, wetbacks.
- Don't react. Just keep moving.
We don't need you. We want
you out of our country.
We want you back to Mexico. Get
the hell out of our country.
What do you think
you're looking at, huh?
Damn spics, we don't need you.
<i>- ¡Viva!
- Get out!</i>
- Get these sons of bitches off my land.
- Yes, sir.
No, we're not going anywhere.
We have the right to be here.
Well, you suit yourself.
Deputies, now you're witnesses.
This horde invaded my property.
And we're... we're just
defending ourselves.
A man has a duty to
defend his property.
You're damn right he does.
Cesar, they will shoot.
You get rid of 'em.
Everybody move!
Come on, let's go.
Move back. Move back.
No, no, no, no!
Are you gonna do something?
You hard of hearing?
The boss told you to clear out.
He's not my boss.
And our tax dollars paid
for this public road.
Tax dollars?
There's your tax dollars.
Okay, bro?
Hey, Gilbert. Hey, Gilbert.
<i>- Ellos llegaron.
- They're here.</i>
Hey, hey, that's enough now.
Come on.
That's all. Let's go.
<i>- Get on over here.
- Hello.</i>
<i>You're late.</i>
<i>- You get out of here!
- Farm workers in Delano, California,</i>
<i>have begun an unprecedented
strike in the central valley.</i>
<i>Filipino and Mexican
workers have joined forces</i>
<i>to demand fair wages and better
working conditions for their members.</i>
<i>Would you say that
most of your workers</i>
<i>are making a decent living?</i>
All I can say is that
the men have to be
the judges of their
own, what they want,
<i>because they have chosen
this way of life,</i>
<i>and if they were not happy,
they wouldn't be here.</i>
How much have you been
getting for a day's work?
Only two dollars.
- Two dollars a day?
- Yes.
Are you sure it's not broken?
<i>I'm sure.</i>
Dad?
It's okay, Fernando.
Go back to sleep, please.
I said go back to sleep, Fernando.
You have school tomorrow.
Here.
Put it on.
Does this help?
Come on, five minutes to
go and sit at the table.
Bakersfield...
Mm.
To all the growers,
the lawyers and this
garbage injunction.
At least they finally got
Fred to come down here.
This court ruling bans
all mass picketing.
And the best part... they got a ban
on saying the word "huelga"
anywhere near the fields.
- Huelga?
- Huelga.
Can you say "strike"?
So long as you don't translate it.
You'd think a bunch of lawyers would
have heard of the first amendment.
It's a joke. They will get
it thrown out on appeal.
Yeah, by the time the state
court hears the appeals,
the grapes will be picked.
The growers know that.
There's only one thing we can do.
We have to get people to
violate the injunction
and make the sheriff enforce it.
- You mean get arrested?
- Make them arrest us and fill up the jails?
And give the white press
exactly what they want, hmm?
"Rowdy Mexicans in jail."
Have you had your head in
the dirt this whole time?
Things are changing.
Okay, but who's gonna go?
I'll do it.
Once they get you in their jails,
they can figure out ways of keeping
you there a long time, Cesar.
- So I'll do it.
- Do what?
I'll get arrested.
You can't get arrested.
What? Why not?
Well, who's gonna take
care of the kids?
The kids are fine. They're big.
Cesar, you're the one who
says we can't ask our members
- to do things we're not willing to do ourselves.
- I said no.
Dolores, what do you think?
I think it's a good idea.
I think it's a good idea too.
Come, let's eat.
You know how it works.
They don't understand.
<i>¡Huelga!</i>
<i>¡Huelga!</i>
Mrs. Chavez!
- We have a court order...
- ¡Huelga!
that forbids you from
saying the word "huelga."
<i>¡Huelga! ¡Huelga!</i>
This is your first
warning, Mrs. Chavez.
<i>¡Huelga!</i>
This is your second!
<i>¡Huelga! ¡Huelga!</i>
<i>¡Huelga! ¡Huelga!</i>
<i>¡Huelga! ¡Huelga!</i>
<i>¡Huelga! ¡Huelga! ¡Huelga!</i>
Good morning to you.
- Good morning, grace.
- Good morning.
Call my wife and tell her
I'm not gonna make lunch.
Come on, let's go.
I need you to take the trucks
across the border into Mexico
and I want y'all to bring
me back some illegals
who are willing to work
for an honest day's pay.
And I want you to
bring them back here
<i>by the truckload, you hear me?</i>
'Cause we are gonna break
this goddamn strike.
We'll see what them
sons of bitches do
when they see their cousins
out there working the fields.
Jail was amazing?
Yeah, it was.
I got to meet so
many amazing people.
There was this woman Irene...
she was so smart.
And I'm gonna put her
on the credit union.
<i>And also there was this man
who was laying next to me.</i>
Laying next to you?
<i>Yeah, I saw when he got arrested.</i>
The cops were beating him. And
they were calling him names.
And they were trying to get him
to fight back and he wouldn't.
Do you plan on seeing him again?
Cesar, I don't know what
you're talking about.
<i>Well, you know what? Maybe we
can make him part of the team.</i>
We're always looking for good men...
I mean, amazing.
He was amazing, right?
<i>- Cesar...
- No.</i>
<i>- Don't be jealous.
- I'm not jealous.</i>
I'm just glad that you had
such a good time in jail.
Cesar! Cesar!
Hey, Cesar!
This is Jerry Cohen. Remember me?
- Who's that?
- He's a lawyer.
You know that man?
How much do you know
about what we're doing?
Well, I've been analyzing your
strategy, and one thing's clear...
you gotta stop these injunctions.
I mean, they're a catch-22.
The bail alone is
gonna bankrupt you.
With all due respect, I know
you went to a fancy school,
but that doesn't
make you an expert.
Well, I also worked at California
rural legal assistance.
- For how long?
- Two years.
Two years, huh? Why did you leave?
Um, it's complicated.
That's what I heard.
You're hired.
- Hired?
- Yeah.
I want you full-time, starting now.
I thought maybe I'd
do some consulting.
<i>No, as of now, you're in charge of
the united farm workers' legal team.</i>
- Who else is on the team?
- Just you.
Doesn't it take more than
one person to make a team?
Oh, you'll be doing more
work than one person.
Against one of the biggest
law firms in California.
And you'll be getting
paid five dollars a week.
Five dollars a week?
You'll be happy to know
that that makes you the
highest-paid employee,
also our lowest-paid employee.
Everybody makes five
dollars a week?
Hey, if you want to make money,
go work for the growers.
<i>- ¡Viva la huelga!
- ¡Viva!</i>
Come on, come on, come on.
Come. Come, come, come!
Get closer! Closer together!
Run! Come together!
Move back! Move back!
We're not leaving!
Don't move! Stay together!
Pesticide!
Helen! Helen!
It burns.
I know.
I almost got it.
That was really scary, Cesar.
What if something happened to us?
What would happen to the kids?
<i>People are starting to lose
hope, and I don't blame them.</i>
They know the growers have broken the
strike with the illegal workers.
<i>And the sweetheart deal
with the teamsters?</i>
We can't ask them to keep going
when they see people
working in the fields.
<i>We have to take the next step.</i>
We're too weak.
We have no laws to protect us here.
With the boycott, there
are no laws to stop us.
<i>This is the moment, Cesar.</i>
<i>This is what we came here to do.</i>
We just can't boycott
all the growers.
We need to start small.
We need a face, a brand.
That's what we need to focus on.
And that face is Victtore wines.
<i>Dolores Huerta will be
recruiting in the west counties</i>
<i>and Gilbert Padilla will be
recruiting in the Southern cities.</i>
<i>And the rest of the state we'll
divide amongst each other.</i>
Anybody that can travel,
talk to Richard.
<i>My brother knows how to travel.</i>
<i>To be successful, we
have to have an army</i>
of boycotters willing
to do the hard work.
The bigger the army, the
bigger the success.
<i>You start small, you get wins...</i>
<i>the army will get bigger.</i>
The people to best recruit
are the students.
Civil rights groups,
some church groups...
<i>those are the best recruits.</i>
<i>Well, any kind of recruit</i>
<i>is the best kind of recruit for us.</i>
So we need to hit the streets
with aggressive leafleting
<i>and make so much noise,</i>
they won't be able to ignore us.
Picket lines, in churches,
entertainment venues,
colleges, factories,
anywhere where there's a large numbers
of people... that's where you need to go.
<i>Once we got their attention,</i>
<i>we need to get on every radio show</i>
<i>and every television show...</i>
There's no bathrooms in the fields.
There's no minimum wage.
The best thing that you can do,
the way we can put pressure,
is to boycott.
You can help by boycotting
Victtore grapes.
Okay, thank you.
<i>...And tell them personal
stories firsthand,</i>
<i>from the people that have
suffered in the fields.</i>
<i>'Cause we're fighting
for basic human rights.</i>
<i>The attention of
national legislators</i>
<i>was focused on Delano</i>
<i>when the senate subcommittee
on migrant labor</i>
<i>conducted hearings in
the Delano high school.</i>
<i>Headed by New Jersey's
Harrison Williams,</i>
<i>it also included
California's George Murphy</i>
<i>and New York's Robert Kennedy.</i>
<i>Senator Kennedy can
be very supportive</i>
<i>if he thinks the cause
can make a difference.</i>
So when he comes, make sure you walk
with him so they can take pictures.
How are you, sir? How are you?
Thank you. Hi. How are you?
- Senator Kennedy, great to see you again.
- Great to see you.
- Let me introduce you to Cesar Chavez.
- It's a pleasure.
- Likewise. Likewise.
- Go, go, go.
You were supposed to walk with him.
Hi, John. How are you?
Good to see you.
Don't believe everything
you hear today.
<i>I'll try.</i>
- It looks like he's not even talking
to them either. - So fast.
Do you write down the
license plate numbers
of everyone in the city?
I'm glad he came, but I
think it's just for show.
I think you're wrong, Fred.
I hope so.
I also see complaints
here from Mr. Chavez
that pesticides have been sprayed
on some of his picketers.
I'm aware of no such incidents.
What about shots being fired
in their general direction?
We have looked into every one
of Mr. Chavez' complaints
and haven't found an ounce
of truth to any of it.
Is it true that you
detained some picketers
as a preventative measure?
Your arrest record
seems to confirm it.
If I have reason to believe that
there's gonna be a riot started,
and someone tells me there's gonna
be trouble unless I stop them,
it's my duty to stop them.
<i>- You just go out there and arrest them?
- Absolutely.</i>
Who told you they were gonna riot?
The foremen
right out there in the fields,
<i>the ones we were talking to, said
that if we didn't stop them,</i>
<i>they were gonna cut
their hearts out.</i>
So rather than let things get out
of hand, we just removed the cause.
This is a most interesting
concept, I think,
that you suddenly
hear talk of somebody
who's gonna get out of order,
perhaps violate the
law, and so you go in
and arrest the intended
victim of the crime,
and they haven't
done anything wrong.
<i>I want to thank sheriff
Smith for his services</i>
<i>to the citizens of Delano.</i>
We'll now take an hour
recess for lunch.
Excuse me, excuse me,
can I suggest...?
I would just like to suggest
that in the interim period of time,
in the luncheon period of time,
that the sheriff and the Kern
county district attorney
read the constitution of the
United States of America.
I guess I was wrong.
Hey.
<i>Wetback!</i>
<i>We're gonna kick your ass.</i>
<i>You should talk to
Fernando before you go.</i>
<i>He's having trouble
with those kids again.</i>
Where is he?
He's at Richard's.
He's been spending a lot
of time there lately.
Maybe that's not such a good idea.
Well, maybe you should talk to him.
I'll talk to him when I get back.
Cesar, you know that boy
is as stubborn as you are.
<i>Your clean socks are
on the top shelf.</i>
Take all of them.
It's a lot of socks.
It's a long walk.
Cesar, you got a
permit for this march?
It's not a march, sheriff.
It's a pilgrimage all
the way to Sacramento.
And our families are here
just to say goodbye.
Did you hear that?
They don't like working
for a day's wage,
but they will walk over
300 Miles for free.
Even pilgrims ain't allowed in
the street without a permit.
Fine, then we'll use the sidewalks.
It's open to the public.
- Fernando, what are you doing?
- I'm not going with you guys.
He only cares about the union.
Check this out.
A big article about
the auto workers
standing down to show solidarity.
Front page?
Page six, but we're moving up.
And those Longshore workers...
they're standing down too.
<i>- Rookie!
- Mansi!</i>
I saw everybody on the news.
I got tired of just sitting around,
watching a lot of TV, you know.
I got some donations
from a department store.
<i>¿Que 'ó, 'apá?</i>
They're brand-new.
Yeah, about 150 Miles too late.
<i>I am chief executive officer of
the united church of Christ.</i>
My name is Rabbi Tanenbaum and I
came here from New York City.
We believe the united farm workers
and their leader Cesar Chavez
<i>represent the hopes and aspirations</i>
<i>of the vast majority
of farm workers.</i>
I think every American has a stake
<i>to bring about social
change within the system,</i>
<i>because if nonviolent means fail,</i>
this becomes a setback for the
entire Democratic process.
<i>- ¡Huelga! ¡Huelga!
- There's no strike.</i>
<i>¡Huelga! ¡Huelga!</i>
My union... the UAW...
and the industrial union department
will pledge $5,000 a
month to these workers
for as long as it takes
to win their strike.
The average farm worker
only lives to 49.
They say they won't give you
bathrooms in the fields
because Mexicans don't
know how to use them.
<i>I'm Jackie stringer.</i>
<i>We just drove down from Portland.</i>
- That's a long drive.
- I've been watching the news.
I saw pictures of the children
working in the fields.
We'd like to help in some way.
Well, you can do this: Don't
buy any more Victtore products
and no more Victtore
wine at dinner.
- And then have your friends do the same.
- I will.
Excuse me, sir, can I help you?
You have to sit on your
damn booze, you hear me?
I don't care if you have
to sit on it for a year.
We need you to stay strong.
We need you to hold the line.
We're all counting
on you, all of us.
- Excuse us.
- Of course.
Strong? Stay strong?
This boycott is killing us.
Have you seen the headlines
they're getting?
Not just in San
Francisco, but in L.A.
And San Diego and
Fresno and Sacramento.
They're pulling our products
all over the damn state.
And that's costing us money,
real money, Mr. Bogdanovich.
Now you want to come in here and
explain that to our shareholders?
You want to reimburse
us those losses
so our stock price doesn't dip?
Can we sit?
<i>A 340-mile pilgrimage</i>
<i>started in Delano by 67 strikers</i>
<i>concluded today on the steps</i>
<i>of the state capitol in Sacramento,</i>
<i>where more than 10,000 supporters</i>
<i>welcomed Cesar Chavez
and his procession.</i>
<i>The march has
strengthened the boycott</i>
<i>to put pressure on the
label Victtore wines.</i>
<i>¡Huelga! ¡Huelga! ¡Huelga! ¡Huelga!</i>
<i>Cesar. Perdón.</i>
Cesar.
There's a guy on the phone.
He says he's from Victtore.
<i>And he wants to negotiate.</i>
He's called three times.
Get Jerry up here!
<i>Okay.</i>
Fine, you've got your deal.
But if we're gonna pay top dollar,
we expect top-dollar work.
That means no one,
and I mean no one,
is gonna cut unripe
grapes to pad their lugs
<i>or stick them full of
goddamn dirt clods.</i>
- Objection.
- Objection?
What do you mean?
Well, it's a personal objection.
You may not be aware,
<i>but these people have been doing
this for a very long time.</i>
They don't need you to tell
them how to pick a grape.
Well, you tell them that when
they're packing my grapes...
That was the most eloquent
piss I've ever heard.
<i>In California, actor Ronald Reagan</i>

<i>He is the republican

- Helen!
- Leave him alone!
<i>Hey, you wetback. Here,
beaner, beaner, beaner boy.</i>
Get out of here! Get
the hell out of here!
What are you doing?
I'm standing up for my son!
Because somebody has to!
What's your plan?
You can't stay at your
grandparents' house forever.
Don't act like all of a sudden
you're interested in what I'm doing.
Of course I'm interested.
You're my son.
Don't worry. I'll be fine.
Can you rethink this?
<i>Fernando is gonna be
fine with your parents.</i>
And I'm sure he'll be back soon.
It's gonna be fine.
Aren't you going to eat something?
You want some carrots and
broccoli that your grandpa grows?
You still hungry?
A carrot?
I just got word.
Chavez is gonna target us next.
Zucchini.
Dad, what should we do?
I don't know, John.
I'm not the one that went to college.
I'm not the one with the master's degree.
I'm only the one who
invested a lot of money
in his only son,
hoping that one day
he'd be able to answer
one simple question:
How do I not drive
my father's business
into the fucking ground?
I'll... I'll talk to the sheriff.
Here, big man.
<i>Okay? A chickpea?</i>
No?
No, no, you can leave him.
He's fine.
Maria, you know about
this Chavez, no?
Do you really think
he's one of you?
Well, then I'm one of you too,
because I came from
Croatia with nothing.
<i>Everything I got, I built
with my own hands,</i>
my own labor, my own sweat.
And I don't see why
anybody should be able
to take that away from me.
- So now you want me to help you?
- No, no, it's very simple:
I want you to do your job.
- Patience.
- Is that what you told Victtore?
Because this time we actually
need you to do something.
Well, you see, after
the senate hearings,
I can't do nothing about nothing
unless they break the law.
Did you hear what I just said?
They're targeting my family now.
Do you understand?
Or do you need my father
to repeat it to you?
I got too much heat on me.
<i>I can turn a blind eye,</i>
<i>but that's as far as
I can go on this.</i>
You do that.
Sit on your ass.
Hey, are you okay? Is he okay?
Yes, I'm okay. I'm okay.
Okay, don't move.
Stop! Stop! I said stop!
Leave him alone! You
don't want to do this!
- You don't want to hurt this man!
- What are you doing, Cesar?
Leave him alone!
This son of a bitch needs to
pay right here, right now.
No, no, no. The next person
who lays a hand on him
is out of the union. He's gone!
<i>You don't want to do this!</i>
<i>Not like this. This is not
the way to do things.</i>
Get that piece of shit out of here.
- What did you say?
- Eli, Eli, Eli, come on.
- What?
- Stop it!
I said, get that piece
of shit out of here
and throw him in the trash.
You need someone to
translate that for you?
Get back.
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop!
You're out of the union!
You're out of the union!
You hear me? You're out!
Go! Get out!
<i>We have completely lost our way.</i>
<i>I mean, how can we condemn</i>
<i>police brutality in
the inner cities,</i>
<i>yet advocate violence
out here in the fields?</i>
How can we criticize the
carnage in Vietnam,
yet cry for blood here at home?
This isn't about Vietnam.
<i>This is about Delano.</i>
This is about being a man.
This is about enough is enough!
No. No, no, no.
Those of you running
around destroying things,
giving into your hatred,
into your chickenshit macho ideals
are seriously sabotaging
the efforts of La Causa,
and I will not stand for it!
I failed you.
I failed you as a leader.
And I have something to tell you.
Three days ago I stopped eating.
And I will continue to fast
until everyone, and
I mean everyone,
in our beautiful movement
makes a pledge
recommitting themselves
to nonviolence.
'Cause we move forward together
or not at all.
So that's your big solution...
starving yourself?
That helps them more than us!
- Settle down.
- Yes or no? Yes or no?
- Yes.
- Settle down.
Come on, please sit down.
The meeting's not over.
You okay?
I had a bad dream.
A dream about food again?
Huh-uh.
The ranch.
The horses were screaming.
Like when the bulldozer came.
<i>I couldn't move my legs.</i>
<i>And everyone left me behind.</i>
I haven't thought about
that bulldozer in years.
What I remember most
was that feeling...
that feeling of...
of impotence
<i>when that bulldozer
knocked over the farm.</i>
Dad couldn't look me in the eye.
The look on his face...
the shame behind his eyes...
it never left him.
<i>It was the first time I
saw the old man cry.</i>
That's what I'm
scared of, rookie...
to go back
and face my family
after everything that
I put them through
and tell them that it
was all for nothing.
So this is how you face it?
Mansi, listen,
you know I've been with you
through thick and through thin.
But we need a leader, not a martyr.
We need to understand
what you're doing.
I lost my way.
<i>We've all lost our way.</i>
The violence, the anger.
I'm angry too.
I'm angry that I live in a world
where a man who picks your
food can't feed his family.
I used to think that...
that the fight was
with the growers.
It's with ourselves.
We need to stop
acting like victims.
<i>I'm not going to stop.</i>
I'm gonna see it all
the way through.
Because if we lose,
I won't be able to look
at my family in the eye.
What if you die, Mansi?
Who are we gonna look to then?
Get up there. It's a great shot.
<i>If you're just arriving,
please head to</i>
<i>the registration table to check in</i>
<i>and sign our pledge of nonviolence.</i>
<i>If you're just arriving, please
head to the registration table</i>
<i>to check in and sign our
pledge of nonviolence.</i>
<i>Mrs. Juana Gonzalez, your children</i>
<i>are waiting for you
in the donation area.</i>
<i>Mrs. Juana Gonzalez, your
children are waiting for you</i>
<i>in the donation collection area.</i>
It's okay. It's okay, Cesar.
<i>There is no strike
in the vineyards.</i>
<i>Our workers have
sought to stay with us</i>
<i>and continue work
without any interest</i>
in these outside organizers.
They don't belong here.
And I wish they'd all
<i>go back to where they came from.</i>
<i>The Chavez group are seeking</i>
<i>to force the growers to
recognize their group</i>
<i>- as the bargaining agent.
- ¡Huelga! ¡Huelga!</i>
<i>...Strikes and have interfered
with our daily workers.</i>
<i>And the only contracts
that were signed</i>
between Mr. Chavez' union
and a few wineries
that signed up under the
coercion of his threats...
<i>Mr. Chavez!</i>
<i>What if something happened to us?</i>
<i>- Standing up for my son!
- What would happen to the kids?</i>
<i>Mr. Chavez!</i>
They've been coming
in bigger numbers
ever since Chavez quit eating.
How long can a man go without food?
It depends on the man, John.
Everything depends on the man.
Maybe we let Chavez
starve himself to death.
Then we don't have to do anything.
Unfortunately, I don't think
he's the suicidal type.
<i>Ma, I'm gonna leave
some more stuff here...</i>
<i>mostly clothes I
don't wear anymore.</i>
Mom, what's wrong?
Does he know what
he's doing to you?
No, he doesn't.
Please go see your
father before you leave.
How is he?
He's not good.
Thank you. My brother
appreciates it.
- You want to lie down?
- No.
- Come on, I'll fix your pillow for you.
- No, no.
No, I'm okay.
Okay.
I'm gonna go home now.
Do you need anything?
Did Fernando come?
No.
I come as an American citizen
to honor him for
what he has done...
not just for you, not
just for the state,
but for all of the United
States of America.
I come here out of respect
for one of the heroic
figures of our time...
Cesar Chavez!
<i>- ¡viva Cesar Chavez!
- ¡Viva!</i>
<i>- ¡Viva Cesar Chavez!
- ¡Viva!</i>
<i>And I think should support the farm
worker and support the farmer.</i>
<i>And the farm workers are in
that field, in that ranch.</i>
<i>They're working.
They're not on strike.</i>
<i>Meanwhile, Cesar Chavez
has organized his efforts</i>
<i>to employ a new tactic,</i>
<i>one that would have
a national effect.</i>
<i>One of the biggest facts is
that the American public</i>
<i>won't stand for injustice,
as long as they know.</i>
And we're fighting
for legitimate wages
in a legitimate way.
<i>And one of the biggest weapons
that we have is the boycott.</i>
<i>Not only is it an economic weapon,</i>
<i>but it's also a nonviolent weapon.</i>
<i>Picket lines have been put
around supermarkets...</i>
<i>- Prick.
- ...in 23 major cities.</i>
<i>Most supermarkets in the
country still stock grapes,</i>
<i>but a significant
number of shoppers,</i>
<i>mostly housewives, are
not buying the grapes.</i>
<i>They are observing the boycott.</i>
<i>That's our report from
Delano, California.</i>
<i>This is Charles Walker.</i>
We know that your organization supported
us in the picket lines in Pittsburg,
and we were wondering if
maybe you could organize
another team of people
again this coming week.
What city are you in? Montreal?
Okay, well, Wisconsin's next, okay?
Okay, I'll tell everyone.
Thank you. Bye.
The last report estimates
that we've cost them
$17 million to date.
I wish they paid
that in fair wages.
What your view is of the strike
- or boycott of the grape industry.
- Oh, the grape boycott.
Well, I've classified
that in the past
in a number of public occasions
as immoral. And I think it is.
Get me John on the phone!
<i>- Yes, sir.
- Son of a...</i>
Oh, God.
Did you see it?
Yeah, man of the year.
I thought they was
gonna make him pope.
I know. It's all right.
Well, let's get together on Sunday.
<i>She told me and I forgot.</i>
But she looks great.
She looks great.
Yes, she does.
All right, gentlemen,
look, I say it's time
for the families
to put their differences aside
and speak together with one voice.
I agree.
Let's sit down with these bastards
and settle this thing
once and for all.
Jack, are you serious?
You want to sit down
with these characters?
We can't hold on much longer.
This boycott's
bleeding us to death.
Yeah, and if we sit down with them,
it won't be a boycott, it
will be an insurrection.
We still gotta negotiate.
We don't have to negotiate.
We have to dictate terms.
Okay, look,
I hate dealing with
these dirty foreigners,
but we can't keep putting
on fake labels forever.
I'm a dirty foreigner, Jack.
You know what I mean.
And I'm not the only one
who feels like this.
You're not?
Well, who else feels that way?
Jack's got a point.
It's time for us
to cut our losses and negotiate.
But you don't negotiate
with children.
You don't give children every
piece of candy in the store.
With children, you set the rules
and you make sure they obey them.
<i>- How have you been?
- I'm good.</i>
<i>I broke 70.</i>
You know, when the Chinese came to
America to build the railroads,
you know what they demanded
of their overseers?
No.
Food.
Good food.
And enough time to enjoy it.
And if the owners skimped on that,
they wouldn't lift a finger.
Give the Chinese a
good meal every day
and they could build the
infrastructure of a continent.
Their meal is what gave
their lives their dignity.
And to them,
dignity was more
important than money.
That's nice, huh?
You have this annoying habit
of turning everything
into a lesson.
I just like Chinese food.
How are you doing?
I told you, I'm good.
With golf?
What's wrong with golf?
You're becoming a real American.
Golf is from Scotland.
<i>We interrupt to bring you this
bulletin from Los Angeles.</i>
<i>New York senator Robert Kennedy</i>
<i>has been shot in the
head minutes ago</i>
<i>as he left the platform
from which he made</i>
<i>his victory statement
in Los Angeles.</i>
<i>The detailed report which
we did receive initially</i>
<i>pictured Kennedy on the
floor of a hotel kitchen,</i>
<i>blood streaming from his face,</i>
<i>his eyes open but unseeing.</i>
<i>He is on his way, or perhaps
has already arrived,</i>
<i>at an unnamed hospital
in Los Angeles.</i>
<i>The moment further
word is received,</i>
<i>we will pass it along
to you immediately.</i>
<i>The final act</i>
<i>in the stunning tragedy
of Robert Francis Kennedy</i>
<i>began this morning with
the touching ceremony</i>
<i>in St. Patrick's cathedral
here in New York City.</i>
<i>The late senator was then transported
to his final resting place,</i>
<i>near his brother the
late president,</i>
<i>at Arlington national cemetery.</i>
<i>I, Richard Milhous Nixon,
do solemnly swear...</i>
<i>- ¡viva La Causa!
- ¡Viva!</i>
<i>...That I will faithfully execute</i>
the office of president
of the United States...
and will to the best
of my ability...
<i>preserve, protect and defend...</i>
<i>the constitution of
the United States...</i>
<i>so help me God.</i>
<i>We thank you for all that
you're doing for us.</i>
<i>We very much appreciate it.</i>
Yes, sir.
Well, you're someone who
understands business
and you're a Californian.
We're all Californians here.
Yes, sir.
I'll do my best.
And thank you. Thank you so much.
Take care.
Bye.
Nixon has promised to sell
our grapes in Europe.
And whatever's left over, he'll
have the department of defense
buy and feed to our soldiers.
<i>They're getting you out in five days,
but I'm not sure about the others.</i>
<i>They're saying we provoked them,
that the strike is not legal.</i>
<i>They're painting us to
look like criminals.</i>
<i>And ever since they dumped
the grapes in Europe,</i>
their sales have gone up there
140 percent.
We're not gonna survive Nixon.
We have to go there.
To Europe?
If they're running, we
have to catch them.
We can barely keep things
together here, Mansi.
I know.
I never thought I'd be
saying this in my life.
It has to be done.
To Richard Milhous Nixon.
To Nixon!
Focus on human law, since it
actually exists over in Europe.
The growers have completely
subverted the system here,
but Europe still defends
workers' rights.
I think they get one-month
vacations there.
You might want to mention that
Vietnam is basically awash
in Bogdanovich's grapes and napalm.
I heard the food is
terrible over there.
I don't care how bad the food is,
- you're not starting a fast, Cesar.
- Where's my coat?
Hey, Helen. You should
see this place.
Yeah. How are the kids?
And Fernando?
Mm-hmm, okay.
<i>Well, I'll see you
in a couple of days.</i>
<i>Fares, please. Yes, sir.</i>
- Albert.
- 2P, please.
- Mr. Chavez?
- Yes.
Oh, lovely to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- Welcome.
<i>Hi. Nice to meet you.</i>
<i>We're here with Cesar Chavez,
the civil rights activist</i>
who has caused quite a stir in
America from his ongoing boycott
<i>that has meant millions of Americans
have stopped eating table grapes.</i>
- Does that work for you, Mr. Chavez?
- Thank you.
Hey, guys, stop.
<i>We're making a plea of
common sense to an industry</i>
<i>that refuses to recognize the basic
human rights of its workers.</i>
<i>And besides this boycott,
your movement has marched</i>
<i>and striked, and you yourself
have done a 25-day fast.</i>
<i>- Why has it gone this far?
- Well, despite the success that we had</i>
<i>against the growers in California,</i>
<i>they still refuse to sit
down and negotiate with us.</i>
And it's not a question
of economics anymore,
<i>it's more of stubbornness.</i>
<i>They want to show that
they're strong and not weak.</i>
<i>So they would rather
export the grapes</i>
They'd rather sell the grapes
to London or Stockholm
and think that that will erase
<i>all the indignities
that people suffered.</i>
<i>And what kind of support</i>
<i>- have you received here in Great Britain?
- Well, here in Great Britain,</i>
we have the transport and
general workers union's support
<i>and they've endorsed our boycott.</i>
<i>The dock loaders refused
to unload grapes...</i>
Hey, what are you saying to me now?
Hey, wait a minute. We had a deal.
which is a great endorsement
of our boycott.
And we're optimistic to have
similar support from
other countries.
<i>Diverse religious groups</i>
<i>throughout the continent
have shown their support.</i>
<i>And even the pope has
agreed to meet us.</i>
Now I've got them grapes
halfway through the Atlantic.
Hello?
<i>So what are you hoping to achieve?</i>
<i>Well, it's never been
about the grapes.</i>
<i>It's always been
about the people...</i>
<i>the poorest of the poor,
the marginalized,</i>
<i>the ones who have been ignored.</i>
Boycott grapes! Boycott grapes!
<i>There would be no food on the table</i>
<i>without these people.</i>
Boycott grapes! Boycott grapes!
<i>These people have
names, faces, families.</i>
<i>And I guess what we
want to accomplish is</i>
<i>to give these people a voice.</i>
<i>But will this be enough,</i>
<i>considering the
amount of resistance?</i>
Once social change begins,
it can't be reversed.
<i>You can't uneducate someone
who's learned how to read.</i>
<i>You can't humiliate
someone who has pride.</i>
And you can't oppress someone
who is not afraid anymore.
We've seen the future
and the future is ours.
Ready?
Don't answer it.
I'm right here.
- Don't take three hours.
- One second.
I have to drop this off.
What's wrong?
They want to sign.
- Who?
- All of them.
All the growers want to sign.
An interesting day you
choose to be late.
Come on, they're waiting inside.
You have to admit, this old
croat put up a hell of a fight.
Yeah, I can do that, as
long as you can admit
this little Mexican
kicked your ass.
<i>Brothers and sisters of the fields,</i>
<i>all around us there
were those who said</i>
<i>it could never be done.</i>
<i>People said</i>
<i>that the growers were too powerful,</i>
<i>the police would be against us...</i>
<i>And the courts would beat us down,</i>
and that sooner or later
we would fall back
into the poverty and despair
of our forefathers.
But we did it!
We did it because...
because our common suffering
and love for each other
kept us together.
Five years we were on strike!
But it kept us
sacrificing and fighting
for a better tomorrow...
<i>a better tomorrow that
we all dream about</i>
<i>as we work amongst
these beautiful vines.</i>
And when millions and
millions of Americans
stopped doing one thing...
eating grapes...
we won the strike!
We won!
<i>We won!</i>
<i>I know there's no way to justify</i>
<i>the things that I've done</i>
<i>or that I've not done for you.</i>
<i>And it saddens me to think</i>
<i>that we never got a chance
to go fishing together</i>
<i>or catch a baseball game</i>
<i>or even go watch a movie.</i>
<i>There's no way to
turn back the clock</i>
<i>and to make up for lost time.</i>
<i>But I want you to know
that your mother and I</i>
<i>miss you very much, Fernando.</i>
<i>It seems so ironic to think</i>
<i>that because I've
tried to do things</i>
<i>that my father could
never do for us,</i>
<i>I'm now so distant from you.</i>
<i>Please know that the day
you came into this world</i>
<i>was also the day that I
received the clarity</i>
<i>that I so desperately needed.</i>
<i>You and your brothers and sisters</i>
<i>are the purpose for my struggle.</i>
<i>Everything I do is for you.</i>
<i>And I hope you remember that.</i>
<i>I also hope that one day</i>
<i>you can be as proud
of me as I am of you.</i>
<i>But I want... more
than anything else,</i>
<i>I'd like to see the poor take a...</i>
<i>a very direct part
in shaping society.</i>
<i>And let them make the decisions.</i>
<i>And in our case, if the
poor aren't involved,</i>
<i>change will never come.</i>
