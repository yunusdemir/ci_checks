THE GREEN BEAUTIFUL
Good morning everybody, we have news,
the meeting of the planet is opened!
We need more of the rye... Yes.
We have some wheat.
We need soya!
We have it!
We have a big crop of dry fruits!
Yes. I would need it for two months.
Medicines?
Yes!
We won't have enough for everybody.
Oh, wool, who wants some wool?
It's good.
How many knives do we need?
Seventeen.
Schools?
We would need a teacher of telepathy.
Mass died, we have nobody who's ready.
Ok, I'll come to you this year.
A teacher of future prediction?
I can, but only for six months.
I have a grandson who I am going to deliver.
Marriages?
Three boys.
Then deaths.
There was Amais, 255 and a quarter years old.
248 years old Aramos. Laleta, 272 years old.
All died happy and wise.
Ah, on the contrary. There was
the death of Amile
who was only 143 years old.
He had an accident, a rock-fall.
How're you Mila. It is not too sad for you?
It's alright. The kids help me out.
Fine, then travels?
This year we really need to
send somebody to the Earth.
It's been 200 years since we were there.
Who wants to go to the Earth?
To Narbos?
We can only send ten to Narbos.
You arrange it between yourselves.
To Earth?
To Cristo?
Oh my. We can send only 23
to Cristo. You decide who.
Who wants to go to the Earth?
Nobody for the Earth?
Fine. What should we do?
As usual, we don't go there?
It's been 200 years since
the last time we went.
This year we should send somebody there.
What for?
Nothing special. We observe,
we enquire, we see what we can do.
We can do nothing...
Sure, other planets teach us
things, as do we, but the Earth...
Well, alright. They are very
primitive but that's no reason to...
And dangerous!
We could have sent them someone
with the program of disconnection,
to move them forward more quickly.
But we don't even know where they are now!
We could guess.
I could get information
about the Earth from Osam.
He was the last one there, but
he's been on Narbonne for 20 years.
I'm here. You didn't see me.
I came back from Narbonne 2 months ago.
Greetings Osam! I had not seen you.
So, could you tell us how advanced they were
at the time that you returned from the Earth?
Yes, of course, but it was a long time ago.
There were two of us. Mila's father and I.
We landed in Paris, France. There
was a revolution against the King.
That's right. They had become a republic,
but that was very quickly spoiled.
They had an Emperor, Napoleon,
or something like that.
An aggressor, who slaughtered
people in stupid wars.
After this, the kings came back.
Society continued to degrade.
Leaders, presidents, all those,
came one after another.
Was it really that difficult over there?
Oh yes. Law of the strongest, gender
inequality, no distribution, massacres.
We had a feeling that it would
take them centuries to recover.
They even had the system of the money still.
Before we left I had hidden some gold.
What is this money?
For instance if you need something,
you can't get it without money.
Even to eat?
Especially!
But to eat is a necessity.
We die if we don't eat.
But they do this. If you
have no money you have nothing.
You think that they still have this money?
No, I really don't think so.
When we left, that was the
beginning of an industrial era.
What is that?
I think we passed it about
3000 years ago or close to that.
It was competition, literacy, mass
production of useless objects, wars,
nuclear technology, destruction of nature,
diseases without cures, a prehistoric period!
Last year my brother had
a telepathic contact with the Earth.
Yes, I saw a country where the
women had veils on their faces,
and they didn't even have
the right to drive a car.
Impossible! You think
that they still have cars?
What is it, cars?
I have never seen it, because when we
left the Earth, they still didn't have them.
But it seems that we too once
had cars in our industrial era.
Yes, we teach it in archaeology.
They were made of iron.
You sit down inside it and move all around.
People didn't walk any more
and then died from heart attacks.
And there were millions of
deaths from accidents.
But I really think in 200 years they
would've had the time to get rid of those cars.
What about their hierarchy?
Oh, that hierarchy.
Over there is something.
The men think they're superior to the women,
city people above the villagers,
adults are better than the children,
the human beings are superior to
the animals and plants,
and then there are the races.
What is it? It's a big planet,
with many different continents,
which results in many different human
beings becoming separated from each other.
Then when they meet,
the most degenerate
thought that they were superior to
everyone else. There were mass killings
and now it is the degenerates
who dominate everything.
We were lucky with our
little planet. The single race,
the single climate, the single
way of development, easy!
But it's not because they didn't
have a chance, they didn't even try.
Anyway, we shouldn't give up on them. We
can't say that we've done anything to help.
But they are not open to communication.
They are probably playing with computers
instead of exercising their brain.
They are using only 10% of it.
Oh, their brain must be the
size of a sheep's poo.
It's useless to go there.
They should go their own way.
It's like with lettuce. Do not pull over
its soil and it'll grow more quickly!
But we could've thrown a
little manure on their lettuce.
Yes, we can disconnect a small group
of well chosen people to help them.
So, volunteers?
Anyone? Come on, just one,
full of courage.
Excuse me, but I want to go there.
Oh mum, you want to go?
Mila, you want to go there?
No, no, she's not going there!
Yes, I want to go there.
Mum, are you crazy?
So Mila, are you going or not?
No!
Yes!
Alright, we will give you the
program of the Europeans' languages.
We have found almost all of them.
We're going to try to make you land in Paris,
but we aren't sure that you'll arrive there.
We have two programs of disconnection,
a light one and a stronger one.
OK, but do I need any
training to use the light one?
No, no, it is routine.
When you speak with someone it will
automatically start working. That's it.
And the other one?
It's just like that.
Like that?
Yes, but be careful with this one.
You will need to use discretion
because it shakes them up.
After they've been disconnected,
they start to speak and act truthfully.
Sometimes this makes them
advance five centuries.
This program's intense. OK.
We can send you more programs,
if you want. Just call us.
Disconnect a group of them, then if
you want, come back. That's all.
Mila?
I've made you some footwear.
It's not practical and it may hurt your feet,
but I put in lamb's skin to make it softer.
And also a dress Amperor, just like that.
Thanks.
And also a hat.
Ok.
Do you think it's very serious
if I don't take the hat?
If you want, but tell me,
why do you want to go there?
Your father told you something?
Yes, just before dying.
And what did he say?
That he had fallen in love with a woman
from Earth who died delivering his child.
That the baby was me. That he had
brought me back here secretly
and that's why he never
wanted to get married.
Have you ever told anyone about this?
Nobody.
What would have happened
had I told the truth?
Your father was very afraid that
we would return you to Earth.
You mean that you would've expelled me?
Perhaps. No one likes the
earthlings too much here.
Oh no, you are such a racist.
No, what I mean to say is that it's
hard to handle earthlings, you know.
Yes, but me, I was just a baby.
Yes, but it is not always easy
to support the partly-gifted.
I thank you.
No, but not you, you're one of us now.
I think that my sons suspect something.
They are very gifted in telepathy.
It's inherited.
And who was she, my mother?
She was like your
daughters, very unusual.
Your father was crazy about her.
What is she saying?
I don't know. I can't hear. There's
interference and it's creating a disturbance.
I think that she speaks
about our grandmother.
Oh yeah?
And that she's angry with the
racists, something like that.
Yeah?
You won't find out anything, you know.
It's been 200 years for them. That's
eight generations and they die young.
I know, but I'm half way through my
life. I want to know my mother's family.
When are you going to come back, mum?
I'm not going to be gone a long time. Mezai make
sure the children do their telepathy exercises.
Yes, yes, don't worry. And you
shouldn't eat only cherry tree.
Mum, can we sleep at the neighbour's?
Yes, but don't stay up all night.
Mum, can I swim across the lake?
No, you don't go too far in the lake.
You go with Mezage. You watch them, ok?
Yes, yes, don't worry.
Why do you want to go there?
To know where I come from.
Huh?
Oh, the big trees.
They are so beautiful!
What is this odd grey thing
which covers everything?
We would say that they
don't have soil here.
How do they make plants grow?
Oh, what is it over there?
It's a poo.
And another one.
Oh my, don't they have toilets?
Luckily, I have men's footwear.
Looks like there is somebody here.
I am going to try my program of language.
Guten Tag.
Vershtehen Sie, was ich sage?
I say to you that I don't speak English!
Et coste loka tishe?
No comprando!
And now when I speak like this,
do you understand me?
Are you messing with me?
Excuse me Madam, which of these
languages do you speak?
Is it German, French, Spanish?
Are you absolutely insane? You think you can act
like this because you're dressed for a carnival?
Excuse me, I'm working here!!!
I don't have time to talk to everyone who passes!
Thank you Madam.
Wow, they're not very friendly here.
It seems this dress I wear makes it worse.
Hey Nicole, what are you doing?
But you know that we have had
these cakes for three weeks!
Excuse me Sir, could you tell me
which country we are in here.
You are in France.
Oh, tremendous! And what
is the name of the city?
What city?
This one.
What do you mean, this one?
This city here?
Are you messing with me,
we are in Paris!
Oh, thank you. I'm sorry,
I didn't know. Thank you, Sir.
Damn, I am sick of it!
I am sick of it!
Oh my. This air. This must
be what they call pollution.
Oh, it hurts.
I definitely need to find
some water to call home.
I don't see a single dress
anywhere that I can wear.
I look like a moron in my dress.
And all these cars. And noise.
This doesn't seem to
upset them, this noise.
These must be houses.
These big grey things.
The poor people, all stuck up indoors.
Near this noise.
There are not many trees,
but they're beautiful.
What can they possibly carry in these bags?
Why do they all have bags like that?
They look a bit off-colour.
They are all sick!
It's the stomach.
The stomach,
the heart, the liver.
The stomach...
These parts of scrap metal which they
hang on their ears and their necks.
They must be some type
of primitive religious symbols.
Why did I detest archaeology
in class? I was very stupid.
Ah, it would be useful for
me now, the archaeology.
Is that soil?
Oh, why would they
put their soil there?
What is that? Is it an
exhibition of dead bodies?
He cut a piece and gave it to the lady.
Excuse me Madam, what is it you took?
I took nothing.
In your bag?
It's my meat.
What is it for?
To eat.
Oh, you are carnivorous?
Are you messing with me or what?
No, in no way. I'm sorry.
Can I ask you one more thing?
Was it the money that you gave
to the man, the square thing?
What square thing?
You gave him a thing.
Yes, I paid for my meat.
Oh, it was the money.
You pay just like that?
I mean always, to get things?
You have no money, you have nothing?
Oh my, it's still here.
They didn't abolish the money.
Where do they put their water?
After walking for an hour
I should have crossed a stream.
It's not a desert here.
If there are trees,
there must be some water.
Excuse me Sir, I'm absolutely
not making fun of you,
but can you please tell me where
I can find some water around here?
What do you mean making fun of me?
I mean I'm asking you seriously. Where can I
find some water not too far from here?
What do you mean some water?
Some water to drink. But more
importantly water to dip my feet in.
Are you making fun of me?
Oh no, I swear I'm not!
There's a bistro there!
Oh, bistro...
Is there some water in a bistro?
You make fun of me, Madam!
They must have a different
definition of water!
What do I see over there?
There is some water.
What do they put in it?
Hello! Hello! Can you
hear me? It's Mila.
Yes, it goes well. Yes. Yes,
I arrived well in Paris, yes.
Bravo for precision.
And there are trees here.
There are extraordinary trees.
And Ozam, are you there?
So, tell me, where is that
place you hid your gold?
Because I have a problem.
They didn't abolish the money.
No, no, you have no money,
you have nothing. That's right.
Ah?
Where's this?
Some kind of big shed?
With many chairs inside
and coloured windows?
How you say?
Notre Dame de Paris it's called?
OK!
Good, you think that
thing still exists there?
Ah, here is the shed. It's beautiful!
It's a pity that they don't put
trees inside but it's not too bad.
Oh look, this is a guy from our home.
Oh my, it's that poor guy who we sent to
them 2000 years ago. They crucified him.
It's Jesus, this guy.
Oh God, this gives me chills down my back.
What are you doing, madam?
I'm taking some gold.
What are you going to do with it?
I'm going to buy myself
something to eat.
Is it like money?
No, it is gold.
I have some money. Here, look.
Ah, the same square thing that
the lady gave for the corpse.
I can buy myself many bonbons with this.
And if I give you a coin like this one, can
you give me what you eat there? I am hungry.
Yes, but I don't need your coins,
because coins are not worth very much.
Oh?
My banknote is worth more than your coins.
Oh, ok. Here is someone I can
talk to without getting worked up.
Here it is.
So tell me, do you know who he is?
Sure, it's Jesus.
Oh, you know him. And do you
know why they put him there?
When he was born, it is Christmas.
Yes.
I got a gun and a car for Christmas.
Loic, Loic. Come here!
Oh good, a crucified guy equates to
a gun and a car. It's very stupid.
Where did you find this?
Oh my!
I understand why they are so ill
here. This thing shreds your stomach!
Oh, I'm going to have to find a resolution.
Hello, do you hear me?
Hello?
Yes, I found the gold, but
it's no longer worth anything.
No, it's the banknotes
which are worth something.
Banknotes. Papers.
And then, I saw one statue of Jesus.
Crucified. No mistake!
Then the issue of what to drink and eat. It's
a disaster. I can swallow nothing, it makes me ill.
It's going to be necessary to connect me up
on the exchange program with new born.
Oh, I think that they
should have new born here.
OK, go for it.
Wow, thank you.
Wait, wait, what are these
threads you're wearing?
Threads?
Damn, these are such nice clothes.
I have never seen clothes like that!
What material is this?
What is this?
Bio-cardboard?
Oh shit, it's new-age in death!
And pomps they are bluntly too lethal!
And plush pomps, it's my dream!
Without kidding around,
where did you find them?
Where is it? Where is
it? Tell me an address.
Address, it's not very
near, it's really quite far.
Is it your style?
Is this my style? Are you kidding me?
Destroye Sissi Imperatrice, it is my dream!
And if I give you my dress, can you
tell me where I can find a new born?
Umm... damn yeah.
And then you give me your threads?
Yeah!
Oh, this way, I can feel them.
Somewhere here... around here.
Oh, I am hungry, I can't take any more.
Oh, she's so pretty,
maybe my mother was like her...
Oh, you don't look very well.
Come here my baby. Come.
We are going to take care of you.
Oh look, you have a fever.
Yes, yes my baby, I'm here.
Here is your milk my treasure.
Hey, why are you here, Madam?
I am at home.
But what're you doing with this baby?
I recharge it and I recharge myself.
Huh?
I'm not making fun of you, I assure you.
Are you from the family?
What family?
Are you Serbian?
What?
I tell you, if you hurt this baby...
I won't cause it any
harm. I'm helping it.
Look, it has no more fever.
It has big problems, this baby.
What do you mean problems?
It has no mother.
How do you know that
it doesn't have a mother?
Oh, I know it. I feel it.
It has one, but she left it yesterday.
She said that she was going to get
newspapers and she didn't come back.
She won't come back?
She was raped by the Serbians.
By whom?
If she goes back to her Bosnian family with a
Serbian baby they will both be expelled.
Oh, expel? But how?!
Why did you come to take it?
No, I didn't come to take it,
it's only to recharge me.
Sorry?
Look out, the boss is coming.
Who?
It still has a fever?
Yes, but this morning it's almost gone.
Yes or no?
It kind of does.
The mother, she didn't come back?
No, she didn't...
And her, who is she?
Oh, I don't know. I found her...
Who are you, Madam?
Sorry.
Put the baby in its cradle.
If you want.
It belongs to you, this baby?
Was she here before?
I don't think so.
Does she know the mother?
I don't think so.
Then why is this baby in her arms?
I was about to...
You can direct all these
questions to me, you know.
Were you on guard duty?
Do you always interrupt
people like that?
I beg your pardon?
No, don't beg my pardon.
I just want to ask you
if you're always like that?
What do you mean, like that?
I mean you never
listen to people here.
No, because it's a lot more practical
to listen when someone talks.
Madam, do you know
who you are talking to?
To you, I'm talking to you.
Professor Max Varron,
head of this service.
Oh, you are head of this service...
Yes, Madam.
That's why I find it difficult to
communicate, however he's nice.
Are you from the
family of this child?
This child, yes, it is possible.
You will tell the mother of this
child that if she wants to leave...
I'm sorry. I've just arrived
in France. I don't know anything.
And you will definitely
explain this to police.
I don't know the Police.
Excuse me.
I'm going to disconnect him to see.
The only way to get this baby back
to its mother is to make that woman...
How beautiful.
Beautiful!
Why is your hair like that, Gerard?
You have very curly hair, Gerard.
I had never noticed.
Excuse me, mister Max. Can
I talk to you for a moment?
Here it is Sir. My name is Mila.
I come from another planet.
I need your help.
My help?
Yes. The first thing I need is for you to
let me come here to recharge myself in energy
because I can neither drink
nor eat your water and food.
Neither drink nor eat?
But if I grip a baby in my arms for a few hours
then I am recharged for two or three days.
And on top of that it's good
for the baby as well.
Oh, on top of that.
And then I would need a guide to know who
I'm supposed to disconnect, you understand?
...for you to disconnect, yes.
It would be best if I could stay at your
place so that we can discuss all of this.
My place?
Don't worry, I would not be a burden.
I can sleep at your place outside.
Uh, there is a balcony.
Oh, great, there we go!
Excuse me, Max, but we quickly
need to finish follow-up visits.
You have two deliveries on the way.
Two deliveries? But I've
never delivered a baby.
What?
And it's you who must deliver the
baby? It's you, the wise woman, no?
What?
But I don't know how to give
birth. I know nothing about it.
I'd make it worse. I pull,
I push, I cut, I perform Caesarean
section, I watch the monitor,
I give epidurals, but I
have never delivered a baby!
I have never really looked,
or listened, or learned!
I only intervened when I had
to because I was too afraid.
Because I don't know how to
give birth. You understand?
No.
Yes, yes, you understand very well.
Umm?
Go to it, go to it. You'll
do this much better than me.
And then you can tell me.
Good morning madam Deniau.
Good morning.
How are you doing?
I am a bit down but apart
from this, I'm fine.
Ah yes, do you feel a lot of pain?
Ah yeah, but it could be worse.
It's really a bit like...
Tell me, how does the baby come out?
How does it come out?
Yes.
It's a bit like a dish of spaghetti
which gets sucked outside of you.
You see?
Ah right?
And then the pain stops, you see?
Yes?
And then they put the baby on your
belly and you feel its weight.
But outside, you see?
Yes.
It's difficult to explain...
Here is the small balcony.
This will do?
Ah very well.
Thank you very much.
Ah, my wife is coming.
Good evening.
Florence, may I introduce you to Mila who
is going to live on the balcony for a while.
What?
Good evening, Madam. I take up just a small space. I
don't eat, but I need water. Do you have some water?
Some water?
In the bathroom?
There's a bath.
Can I see?
There.
Oh, great. There is no
water in the fountain?
What fountain?
This here.
Oh, the tub!
Yes, there is no water?
Oh, yes, yes. There is some water
but you need to fill it up.
Oh yes, and how does it fill?
Oh, you turn it on.
Where?
Here with the tap. This is hot
water and this is cold water.
Oh, alright, the tap.
Oh yes... Cold? Cold.
Thank you, thanks a lot.
You need to block it.
What do I need to block?
The tub.
Oh yes, to block the tub, yes.
What is all this about?
I don't know.
What do you mean you don't know?
I just don't know. I don't
know anything any more.
Yes, I found a new born.
I feel much better.
I have some water and I've already
disconnected one of them. It's going well.
Who's touched my walk-man?
Oh no, I am fed up here!
What's wrong with it?
It's my favourite show!
It is very blurred.
I'm sick of this place!
You always let Sophie play with my stuff!
But what's wrong with the TV?
The TV doesn't work now! Sophie!
What?
I am sick of your stupidity. I forbid
you to touch my walk-man or the television!
I didn't touch anything.
Calm down, Raul.
It is you who broke the TV.
You both don't know how to use appliances.
Raul, give me the walk-man.
What? Why?
Give me.
Everything goes well. I thank
you very much for having me.
Oh the TV is working! And my
walk-man also! You give it to me?
Turn off this TV please!
Huh?
Turn it off.
What's wrong with him?
He needs to go to bed early
this evening. He must be tired.
He's received a small dose of
disconnection. It really shakes you.
A what?
A small shock.
No, this is mad. Someone could steal them
from us. You can't just leave them there.
How could I have let this happen?
What?
Some say that the children are
the mirror of their parents.
Huh?
I must be a stupid bastard!
Are you sure that you
don't want any blankets?
Oh no, no. Certainly not. I thank
you very much. Good night.
Good night.
He's absolutely crazy, our
papa. You know what he did?
He's left the TV and
my walk-man on the side-walk
and he said that from today on we are going
to speak to each other in this home. Crazy.
You shelter homeless people now?
Florence, am I a stupid bastard?
What do you mean, a stupid bastard?
A moron, an idiot, a man who consisted of
nothing and who lives on the edge of existence.
Oh, this without a doubt, yes.
Yes what?
A moron, an idiot, on the
edge of existence. It is you.
Is that true? Then why
do you stay with me?
For your bank account, my
darling. Lawful prostitution.
Seriously, why?
And yes, I also live on
the edge of existence.
Oh good morning!
You slept well?
Oh yes, very well.
I just understood that...
It seems that you like Rock and Roll.
What?
This music you're listening to...
Oh yes, it's very cheerful. But this would
kill me if you don't stop it, because there...
You want me to stop the music?
Yes! Definitely!
Oh, it's exhausting this music thing.
You don't listen to music at home?
Oh no, not any more.
We have concerts of silence.
Ah! Of silence.
Yes, but we had music before
and we even sent one musician
to you from our home.
A tremendous guy, but
it was a long time ago.
Oh really?
You see all this, it's music,
they sell only music here.
Do you want to listen to anything?
Yeah, I am listening right now.
What do you mean, listening?
The discs there, as you say.
You can hear them?
Oh yes. I concentrate
and I hear them.
I can give them to you
to hear, if you want.
Alright!
Here.
I can also make everyone hear them.
Oh yeah? How?
I connect up the disc to the
thing in the store there.
I don't know what you call it.
With waves.
You want to hear?
Yes, I do.
This one?
Hmm, this one, it's Jean Sebastian.
He's the one I told you about.
He came from our home,
we had sent him to you.
Who?
Jean Sebastian!
From time to time we
still sing songs of his.
That one.
I'll also take those two.
Here you go.
Thank you.
You hear anything?
No.
She could really call
us from time to time.
On 3 we all try together. One, two, three.
Hold on. I have a strange
buzzing in my ear.
What are you doing here?
I was waiting for you.
You want a vase for your flowers?
They are for you.
For me?
This cannot make up for our life.
I was just going to disappear.
Oh?
I'm not leaving you. It's me who I leave.
Yes?
There is dinner ready, if you want.
No, thank you. I am going to pass on it.
I will go to the hospital to recharge a bit.
Oh yeah?
Can I ask you for something?
Yes, what?
I'm sorry, but can I see
what is in your bag there?
In my bag? Yes, of course.
Because I really wonder
what you carry in it.
Oh, not a problem.
This, it's to open houses, right?
And what is this thing for?
It's red lipstick.
Oh? And what is it for?
You put it on your lips. Like that.
Oh yeah? On lips?
Is it a medicine?
No, it's not medicine,
it's to be pretty.
To be pretty?
To be sexy.
Sexy?
Yes, to be attractive.
Oh, to whom?
To everybody.
It must be difficult to do this.
So that they love you.
Oh, I see. It's a kind of medicine so
that everybody loves you, is that right?
Yes, but no, it's not quite that.
And if you don't put it on, nobody
will love you, is that right?
Yes, but...
It's difficult to explain...
Is it what I said? Did I hurt you?
No no, it's nothing.
It's... nothing.
And this?
A photograph.
This is Max, my parents and the children.
I see. It's people who
you love. Is that right?
But then why don't they
have lipstick on their lips?
Hello.
You're crying?
What's happened?
They'll come to take it tomorrow.
It's mother?
No, DDAS.
Who's that?
Welfare services. I won't see it
any more. Nobody will be caring for it.
Keep it then.
Are you crazy? We can't kidnap a child
like that. You need to have documents.
Documents?
Yes, documents that
state that he exists.
Exists?
No. He has lungs, cerebrum, brain and heart.
But if he doesn't have documents he doesn't exist.
My ears are buzzing again.
We'll try again tomorrow.
Sonia! Sonia! Quickly! I need
to get back to the hospital.
We took the baby. This lady is
going to sleep here tonight.
Oh the baby, let me see it.
Oh, what're we going to name it?
Theodore.
Why Theodore? It's an old name, Theodore.
This means that God gave him
to us, or something like that.
Oh yeah? How's it going my Theodore?
Can I hold the baby for a bit?
Sonia, will you give Theodore to...
What was your name again?
Mila.
Oh yeah, to Mila.
Here, this is his bottle. Heat it up for him
in hot water. Over there are his nappies.
Do you have a bath?
We'll wash him in the washbowl.
Yes, but not for him, for me.
And you are sure that it was his mother?
Yes, I'm sure. I know she gave birth here.
And you just let her take him?
Yes, it was his mother.
You should've stopped her!
But why? I was happy that she came back.
Yes, but you knew that we were supposed
to take the baby this morning.
Sonia.
Sonia.
They said that they were
going to investigate!
Macha? She's a very good girl.
She's been working in this service for two
years now. There've never been any problems.
She said that it was the mother of
the child who had come to take it.
Well, if she said so, then it's true.
Oh, absolutely not.
The mother, we found her through
the refugee organisation.
She never came back to the hospital.
She actually left her baby.
Where's this baby then?
Oh finally, there you are.
Hello mummy, how is it going?
It's going well, and you?
We're very well. What's it like over there?
Tons of cars, there are poos everywhere
and the food issue is really complicated.
Do you think that you can
show me where you are now?
Wait, I'll try to send you a picture.
Wait, someone's coming.
Yes, yes, come in.
I'm just having a little foot-bath.
I'm sorry. I just want to
take this for the baby.
Holy cow! She's so pretty.
Hey mum, mum, who was it?
Who?
The one who just came and went out.
It's Macha. I stay at her place.
Will you pass it?
Hello mum? Hello? Can I see it?
Yes, wait I'll try.
I'm sorry. I just wanted
to throw this away.
Holy cow! She's so pretty.
I'm nearly finished.
Hey mum, who was
it I just saw there?
It's Sonia, Macha's younger sister.
Can you connect me to
the kids? Hello mum?
What's wrong with this
radio? It was working fine.
Have you noticed she speaks
to herself in the bathroom?
She's strange.
Look, it's working again.
I'm finished.
What's going on?
I have a feeling, something's coming.
Oh my God, they're coming.
They're very close.
Quickly, hide yourself! With the baby!
Who?
I don't know. I have a feeling that they're coming.
They want to take the baby. Hide somewhere!
But where?
Go upstairs, quickly!
Hurry up, Sonia.
Miss Macha Belle?
No, she doesn't live here any more.
Oh yeah? Since when?
Since I am here.
And when is that?
Well... about six months.
Nevertheless, they gave us
this address at her workplace.
Yes. I see.
We are from DDAS. We came to
investigate a missing baby.
What baby?
Can I ask your name Madam?
Yes, it's Mila.
Madam Mila? Is that right?
Yes, that's right. Mila, yes.
I mean madam Mila, yes.
Do you have a baby?
No, no, I don't have a baby, no.
But aren't those nappies
I see over there?
What?
Nappies!
The pack of nappies.
I have nappies?
On the armchair over there.
Oh, that one, yes, it is a...
Nappies.
Well, if you say so.
And the baby?
There's no baby.
There are nappies but...
...but these things seldom
go one without the other.
Oh yeah?
Thank you.
They'll come back. I'm screwed. I'm
absolutely crazy to have done this.
By taking this child
I risk going to prison.
You want us to take
him back to the hospital?
Why? So they can charge
you as accessories?
You know what?
What?
What if we go to the Louvre museum?
Ok, why?
I was told that there were a tremendous
number of baby paintings in the Louvre.
Oh yeah?
Please Ozam.
We won't say that you helped us.
But everybody will know it!
We want to go there so much.
Yes, but trips must be discussed
during the planet's meetings.
We don't just leave like
that without permission!
Please help us.
But what makes you
suddenly want to go there?
We saw two girls from there.
When mum called us.
Oh yeah? Two girls?
What was the secret mum
told you before she left?
Her mother, your grandmother,
she was an earthling.
Oh yeah?
Oh, you see, we need to go to see
the country of our grandmother.
Max, we have a little problem here.
We all need to stay at
your place for a while.
Huh?
We have a baby with us.
Right! So it was you who took him?
People from welfare services
are searching for him.
Oh my!
Ladies, gents, we're closing!
Take this.
It's for poos!
Thank you.
And if she calls, what should I say?
The kids are doing well, you're keeping
an eye on them and that we've left.
I'm going to be in trouble!
Just blame us.
You're going so far, just like that. I can't
guarantee you the accuracy of the landing.
It's not a big deal.
Where did she see tons of cars?
Where did she see trees
with big green leaves?
It's quite nice.
There's not much water,
but it looks beautiful.
And there are no poos.
And I must say, there
aren't many people.
Wait! I hear something!
It sounds like singing.
Oh yes.
Good morning.
The two of us, we've come
from another planet.
Oh yes, with pleasure. Alright,
we'll walk towards the west.
Oh my, they're great.
Do you realise they invited us
to eat with them right away?
They're really welcoming.
And their telepathy is great.
She's being silly, our mum.
What's this? TV again?
I have no TV, no walk-man.
I borrowed the TV from a mate.
Turn off this TV right now!
I'm sick of this TV
which ruins your brain!
You have no more contact with anybody!
It's not TV that ruins my brain!
Oh yeah? What ruins your brain?
I'm sorry for interrupting. Can
I watch that square thing there?
What thing?
This one.
The TV set?
Yes, I'm really interested.
I have never seen this before.
And Raul could explain to me
how it works, if you don't mind.
Go for it.
So, Mr. Robet, what
is your employment plan?
Alright, listen. My party and
I believe we need to create jobs,
jobs, jobs, and more jobs.
I need to create any jobs to
improve my approval rating;
so that the unemployed leave me in
peace and go away with full pockets!
I have an idea for one new job then!
Yes? What?
A very easy job, and it won't cost money.
One that uses our excess raw material.
This will be costly?
No, absolutely free.
And everybody can do it?
Everybody!
Even the unemployed or are they excluded?
Especially them. No skills required,
we can engage them right away in great
numbers and keep them all busy.
It'll bring us great approval ratings!
So what is it?
Shit eater!
Shit eater?
Yes.
Shit eater?
Yes! That's true, it is
an inexpensive raw material.
And everybody can do it.
That's true, especially the unemployed.
They already have a habit of doing it.
The problem is, what is
the purpose of the job?
No purpose!
What do you mean?
Why do we need a purpose if everybody
can do it and it brings us good ratings?
What?
Why do we need a purpose if
it brings us good ratings?
Yes, that's true.
We'll make a big commercial campaign,
with a big picture of the shit eater.
We'll hire a very good
advertising agency.
"Eat the shit and help your society!"
And we'll pay it off using their tax money
so everything continues as before.
That'll work!
They get their benefits and calm down.
Besides no one really needs a useful job!
Who said we have to
have limits on employment!
There was a meeting where one guy said to me,
"If we demolished all these ugly buildings
and then started to clean the planet, there would
be work for 500 years." Can you imagine that?
Yes, it's because they are mad.
Did he not say what we were
all going to do after that?
We cannot change our society
for such a stupid idea.
That's what I'm saying!!!
It's not our first priority to
create something useful, is it?
Somebody help!
Help!
No, we don't need to change anything.
Shit eater is a great idea.
So, unemployed, go to work!
Do the work!
That stuff is funny.
What is this craziness? Sodden
arsehole! Bloody shit eaters!
Oh, the buzzing is starting again.
Ah, here she is!
Hello mum.
Hi, how's it going?
Yes, we're doing very well.
And the kids, how are they?
Oh, the kids, we can't give
you news about them because...
What do you mean you
can't give me news?
Don't get worked up.
They're doing very well.
Eh mum! We're on the Earth!
Huh?
It's brilliant! It's in no way as bad as
you told us! You know, there're people here
who've lived in this country
for thousands of years.
And they damage absolutely
nothing on their land!
They're very, very nice.
They are all black.
They have the same medicine
as us. They also eat well!
And you know, they
are great in telepathy!
They accepted us right away as
though we were from their family.
They are also advanced like us!
The Earth is very beautiful.
Mum, we want to join you.
How can we?
I have no idea how to do that.
I don't even know where you are.
I need to wake Max and then
we'll see what we can do.
Fine, while you wait I'll send you
a program for disconnection.
Smile when you use it.
Get ready, I'm sending it.
Your credit cards, please.
Have a good trip.
Yes.
Thank you.
We need to call mum.
There's no water here.
You think it could be
in that thing over there?
Let's see.
No water.
It's beautiful.
This makes noise.
Is this a musical instrument?
You think that they still have music?
Is it the thing Jean Sebastian had?
You know the songs that we sing there?
Oh yeah.
Watch out. Somebody's coming.
Hey! I found a thing
where there's some water.
Where?
Come and see!
You see, there is some water, it runs.
Oh yes, it is definitely, yes.
It's a bit small, but good.
Hello mum, how are you?
We're on the plane, everything's ok.
We've been told we arrive at Roissy in 18 hours
30 minutes. We don't know what that means.
Maybe you will understand?
And mum, we're hungry.
We couldn't eat what
they gave us because...
Faster, faster!
Passports please.
Are you alright?
I have a feeling
that something's wrong.
There is danger!
Hey over there. Stop!
You two, stop!
Your passports!
That's what I felt.
This is Max.
How do you do?
They were disconnected, huh?
I am afraid so.
Excuse me Sir, is it an orchestra?
Yes, why?
And it plays at the moment?
What do you mean at the moment?
It plays without stopping.
Even this evening?
Yes, and this evening. It plays the
auditorium of the Bastille this evening. Why?
No reason, just asking.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Is it you Macha?
Is it you Sonia?
Do we know you?
You don't.
But we do.
Oh, that's why...
I hope that they
haven't started yet.
Two tickets please.
Has it started?
For half an hour.
Oh dear.
Wait, wait, let me reconnect them.
You've made it worse.
You got the lead soloist.
We have a problem!
I definitely want to try again,
but it's too difficult to aim.
I risk disconnecting more
of them before I succeed.
Oh no, no, leave it as it is.
I'm interested in music but not the music theory.
You don't have to think to play arpeggios.
You want to play a violin,
you have only one solution.
To play in the conservatory you need
to have power. Power, power, power!
There are many lakes.
We all live at the edge of lakes.
It's always warm and every
evening it rains for one hour.
We don't have houses.
We sleep in sort of grass nests.
When we wake up we go
for a swim in the lake.
Then we have lunch.
We do our washing.
And afterwards we play
games to get stronger.
Every family has its games. For us it's
the trapeze. All our family in fact.
Even the old?
Oh yes, my mother does it
and she's 150 years old.
150?!
Yeah, she has her third
set of teeth already.
She has what?
Towards 135 we have a third
set of teeth which grow.
You too would have it
if you lived that long.
And you can live that long.
We too once died very young
in our industrial era.
There are families who are very skilled in
jumps and there're those who walk on ropes.
And who rules the planet?
It's nobody, and everybody.
We have a planet meeting once a year with delegates
from the villages on the summits of mountains.
Why on the summits of the mountains?
Because when we walk two hours
up a mountain we're more clever.
Then we have meetings about birth
control once a year in the villages.
Birth control?
We decide how many children
we're going to make
according to the size of the crop.
In the morning we play
a bit just like that.
Afterwards we eat.
What do you eat?
Everything. Fruits, vegetables, olives,
kebabs of raw vegetables, grains.
And some meat?
Oh no! We eat beans.
Oh, they are so good, beans!
We eat simply.
You don't have fire?
-Yes, we do, but we
don't use it any more.
Only to make some
knives once a year.
And then we harvest our crops.
Loumi!
What?
Come! Come here!
Here.
And after midday we exercise our minds.
We have classes of telepathy,
predicting the future, interstellar travel,
and mathematics of space.
What is mathematics of space?
It is the strongest discipline.
So, Loumi is going to hide himself.
10,
20,
23.
Loumi, come back!
23!
Yeah!
And you know what will
happen in years to come?
No, I don't know this.
Even by concentrating
you don't have visions?
No.
It's a pity.
It's not always joyful to know.
I would like know so much!
You should ask the boys.
I'm not good in archaeology.
After our industrial era
we had big trials and boycotts.
Trials?
Everyone who produced damaging products
to the health of men, animals and plants
were judged as guilty of genocide
and crimes against the planet.
Oh yes, who?
Food and chemical industries, weapon
factories, tobacco and alcohol,
pharmaceutical and nuclear
industries, car manufacturers,
architects, and many
doctors and politicians
who had become rich by
allowing it to happen.
But that's the whole world!
Oh, it was a civil war!
And after that there
was the boycott.
The boycott?
Everything that caused harm, we
either didn't buy it any more
or we threw it away.
It was the ultimate weapon.
Less purchases means less power.
Even the army and the police could
do nothing against the boycott.
What was the name for this era?
Chaos before revival.
Was there really a revival?
Oh yes!
Could you show us
how to drive a car?
So you are interested
in cars, aren't you?
Excuse us, we're really sorry.
Stupid bastard!!!
We're really sorry.
Stupid bastard!!!
What a stupid bastard. Are you not paying
attention? Where do you think you are, bastard?
Do you know how to drive
or what, bloody idiot?!
Forgive me, Sir. I'm sorry.
Stupid bastard!
I was discussing...
Do you know where you
are, you bloody idiot?!
I don't think there's anything
wrong with your mirror.
Stupid bastard!
See. There is no
scratch on your mirror.
Do you know how to
drive or what, idiot?
Really, I beg for your forgiveness.
I ask you to excuse me.
Stupid bastard!
It's so terrible what
has happened to you!
What?
I said it is terrible
what has happened to you!
Strange stupid bastard!
On the Earth 4 out of 5
people are starving.
There are those who live
in cellars because of bombs.
There are those who are dying
of... of AIDS in hospitals.
There are women who get raped by 25 men at
once to make them understand who's the boss.
And there's you. You, who
experienced such a terrible thing!
We touched your rear-view mirror!
But Sir. Calm down, Sir.
And trees above you with
leaves which move in the wind.
Did you ever look at the trees?
And your beautiful wife, who loses her
youth to cook mushrooms in cream for you
while you betray her. Have you
looked only once at your wife?
And your children with
the nice smooth skin.
Did you ever thank somebody in your life
for the smooth skin of your children?
And there're the cows, which produce milk,
cheese and butter for you every day.
Have you ever said thanks to the cows?!
You are mad, Sir!
Your life is beautiful for God's sake!
It's beautiful, beautiful, worth dying
for. Look at my wholesale trade there!
But there's only one problem, that
we touched your rear-view mirror!
It is terrible! It is terrible!
Thank you!
I'm sorry!
Thank you!
I'm sorry.
Is the whole world
in our home or what?
I'll explain later.
I think we need to go back.
What's the rush?
The kids are alone...
But there is Ozam and the neighbours.
I understand, the girls are cute, but...
We love them.
I can see that.
What if they come with us?
With us? Up there?
What about their family?
Their mother died.
They told us that their father is
unemployed and a long time alcoholic.
I don't know what that means.
They don't even know where he is.
And if they find out who took
the baby they'll put them in prison.
That's true. It's a cute baby.
Mum please.
Well, ask them.
They agree.
Ah, well then...
Hey Mila! My mates father
works in the Park of the Princes.
He gave me tickets to
this evening's match.
Do you think that we could do the
same thing we did with the telly?
OM!!! Olympian of Marseilles!
Could you disconnect those players?
Disconnect them?
Yeah!
Hey, help me.
We go on three.
One, two, three!
You stole it?
Just borrowed.
For dancing.
We'll come back. We
will bring your baby.
We'll come back to see you again.
Oh, don't cry, Raul.
We'll come to see you.
Here, I give you this.
You can disconnect your professors
for a while when they annoy you.
But don't fool around!
Thank you for everything!
No, you helped me...
No, my program can't give
goodness. You had it before.
See you soon.
Yes.
Mila!
Mila, come see this!
I made new dresses. They're
presents for Macha and Sonia.
Yes, the teacher of telepathy said to me
that after Ampires dresses there were Crinoline.
Really, crinolines?
They're nice dresses, but what for...
So that they feel at home.
They are nice. Thank you.
Is it not a good shape?
They could wear them for parties
or use them for holidays.
Mila! Come and see. Come quickly!
What is it?
What's causing this?
Mezage and Mesai gave it to us.
First they didn't want
to show us how to use it!
Oh! What is it?
It's a concert of silence.
What was it?
Why are you laughing?
It's hard to explain, it's a...
It's our humour.
It's because there was...
You didn't hear it?
No.
There was suddenly... uh...
How can we explain this?
It's difficult in words.
You think that one
day we will hear it?
Oh yes! Of course!
Especially you.
This will come very quickly to you!
