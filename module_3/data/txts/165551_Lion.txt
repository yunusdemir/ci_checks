Saroo!
Saroo!
Come on, come on!
Get up!
Come on. Quickly!
Hold it properly.
Saroo, catch!
Hey! Hey!
Get down!
Guddu! The guards!
Hey!
Hey, boy, get down!
Go! Get down, boy!
- Saroo!
- Guddu!
Saroo.
I'm here.
We will get a lot of money today.
We've got a lot of coal!
Show me!
Ohhh, so much!
You kept telling me how little I am...
...but see how clever I am?
That's right, you are!
You jumped from so high! What a leap!
Yes great heights!
Give them some milk - two packets.
Guddu, I want some jalebis!
One day I will buy you some jalebis.
We'll buy the whole shop.
Ha, alright.
Which way should I go now?
Left, left!
Which way now?
Right, right.
Do you want to drink some milk?
I got some milk!
Hey.
It's magic.
Tell me now...
...how did you get the milk?
Be honest.
Guddu? Saroo?
No.
Okay, Shekila, I have to work now.
Who's going to look after Shekila?
My Saroo?
Come. Eat.
Sleep... Sleep.
How long will you be away for?
You did a really good job today.
I want to come too.
How many days?
I'm going for a week.
Who's going to look after Shekila?
Kallu will be here.
You're too small to lift bales.
I can lift anything.
Guddu.
Can I come too?
You're too small, you can't do this.
I can lift anything.
Saroo.
I've told you.
It's night work. Not for kids.
Go, go. You're too small.
Saroo, leave it.
I can lift this.
Okay, fine.
Hey, Guddu!
Hey! How are you, Shankar?
Saroo, come on, wake up now!
Saroo, wake up.
I want to sleep.
I want to sleep.
Saroo, wake up
Don't annoy me. I am sleeping.
It's my fault.
I brought you here.
You're too young for the night work.
It's so late.
You will never be able to work.
Saroo,
Saroo, I'm going to find out
about work, okay?
And then I'll come back.
You wait here, don't go anywhere.
Guddu.
Just bring back a hundred jalebis.
You want jalebis?
Bring me two thousand jalebis!
Jalebis?
Just wait there. Don't go anywhere.
Guddu?
Guddu?
Guddu?
Guddu?
Help me!
Guddu!
Guddu!
Help me!
Guddu!
Someone save me!
Guddu!
Help me!
Guddu!
Mum, I love you very much.
Guddu, I miss you very much.
The train on platform two is
a decommissioned train.
It is not taking passengers.
Save me!
Someone help me!
Get me out of here!
Save me...
Get me out of here!
Save me!
Guddu!
Save me!
Open!
Guddu!
Mum!
Guddu!
Mum!
Ganestalay?
Ganestalay?
I want to go home. Ganestalay.
Ganestalay?
Ganestalay?
I don't understand!
I want to go home.
Speak Bengali! I don't understand you.
Move!
Ganestalay?
Don't walk on that, you'll fall off.
What's the matter,
you don't understand Bengali?
Do you understand Hindi?
Yes.
Where are you going?
I have to go home. I am lost.
Did you come from this way or that way?
I don't know which way.
Then how will you go?
What's your name?
Saroo.
My name is Noor.
You're hungry?
Come on...
Come inside.
Come on, come on!
I have to do all this...
...make lunch boxes for all the men.
You have to feed your stomach, you know.
Everybody has to work.
I help my mum...
...to carry rocks.
Your mum carries rocks?
What is this?
Just drink.
Leave some for me!
Huh?
And now a bit of soap...
There is a man...
...and he is called Rama.
He's a very good man.
He helps everyone.
He will help you too.
He's coming tomorrow morning.
Is he going to help me look for my mum?
Mm.
He's going to help you look for your mum.
Hmm?
Close your eyes...
...go to sleep.
Sleep.
Oh, my baby...
...were you sleeping?
I wonder what worlds you've travelled in.
Are you Rama?
Yes, but not the God.
Ah...
Come and lie down.
Come closer.
Do you know, I've come to meet you
from really far away...
...and I want to take you
to a really nice place.
Are you going to take me to Mum?
And from there we're going
to try and look for your mum.
I'll be back tonight...
...and then we'll search.
Huh?
Get up!
Come closer.
Say "thank you".
Thank you.
You've done well.
He's exactly what they're looking for.
What happened, you didn't drink?
You don't like it?
Hmm?
Why are you down?
Drink this.
Saroo!
Saroo!
Saroo!
Good boy!
Good boy!
Go pick up the small ones.
Go pick up the small ones.
Good boy!
Good boy.
Good boy.
Good boy!
Who's my good boy?
Who is it?
I'm sorry, Mum.
So I came out of the cafe...
...and started talking to him.
I realized he doesn't
speak a word of Bengali.
He only speaks Hindi.
I asked him where he was from.
He replied with only one word...
"Ganestalay".
- Ganestalay?
- Ganestalay.
I've never heard of it.
Ganestalay.
Okay, which district is Ganestalay in?
Which district is Ganestalay in?
What is your mother's name?
Mum.
What's your name?
Amita.
This is a very bad place.
Does anybody ever leave here?
I've seen it.
What are you going to do once you leave?
I'm going to buy a watch.
Did you write it?
Hey, Shondeep! What are you doing?
Stop!
Shondeep!
Stop! Stop right now!
Why are you being so naughty?
Shondeep!
Come with me,
I'm going to give you a good beating!
You won't get away with this!
Hey. Hey.
Hey! Shondeep!
Shondeep!
Come on!
Look this way, look this way.
It's me.
It's okay, I'll take him.
Bring him back before morning.
Hey. Hey.
Yes, Saroo.
My name is Mrs. Sood. Come sit here.
It's my job to make sure that
...there isn't a single kid here
...who should be somewhere else.
That's why I'm here.
People don't like me here.
Look at this.
We have been asking around
about you for a long time.
We have published it in the newspaper.
In all the newspapers in Calcutta.
15 million people read this paper.
That's a lot of people.
But we haven't...
...had a single reply.
My home is really far.
Not one reply.
What about Mum?
No...
...not even Mum.
Guddu?
Saroo.
We have found a family over in Australia...
...who want to look after you.
Do you know where Australia is?
Would you like to see them?
Come.
I'll show you.
Come sit here.
Look.
Look at this. This is John...
...and this is Sue.
This...
...this is their home.
They live in Tasmania...
...a small island...
...and everyone there is really nice.
They are such nice people!
Aren't they?
Keep this with you, and keep it safe.
OK?
Saroo.
Son, you can't stay here.
Hmm?
Did you really look for my mum?
Looked everywhere.
You'll have a nice home.
Australia is a great place.
Does everybody have a napkin?
This is called a "serviette".
Serviette.
Lay it down on your lap like this
so that food doesn't fall on your clothes.
So it doesn't ruin them.
I'm going to teach you
how to eat using cutlery.
I will ask you, and you will tell me
in English... what each thing is called.
What do you call this?
Fork.
Fork. Yes, good.
What do you call this?
- Nice.
- Knife.
Knife.
Not "nice"..."knife".
Okay?
- Good.
- Knife.
And this?
- Spoon.
- Spoon.
- Spoon. Good.
- Spoon.
Okay, Manisha, you tell me... What is this?
Try to remember...
- Salt.
- Salt.
Very good.
Peppa!
- Pepper.
- Pepper.
Pepper.
In here.
Saroo.
This is your mum and dad.
Say hello.
Hello. I'm Swarmina.
Hello. I'm John. This is Sue.
Hello, there.
Hello. Here, that's for you.
Good on the plane?
- Yeah, good?
- He doesn't...
Sue.
Mummy and...
Dad.
And we're so happy to meet you.
Yeah.
A boat.
Amazing.
Gently, gently.
This is where you live.
Down there,
that's the living room.
Television.
Do you know
what a television is?
Pictures.
That's the water.
That's the water.
You see?
You can open it.
Do you want me
to cut it up for him?
Good.
Pepper.
- What was that?
- Pepper.
Oh!
Yes, pepper.
- That's right. And...
- Pepper.
- Sauce.
- Sauce!
- S... Salt.
- Salt.
Very good.
Hi.
So you've come a long way,
haven't you, hmm?
Little one.
I'm sure it hasn't been easy,
and one day you'll tell me
all about it.
You'll tell me everything.
Who you are, everything.
I'll always listen.
Always.
See? Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Go easy on me, yeah?
Okay.
- Okay!
- Right.
- Mum, ready?
- Feel the tension.
Here he comes.
Come on, mate, send it down.
- Yeah!
- Go, go, Saroo!
Come on, run in!
Yes, she's out!
Australia wins!
Well done.
How could you do that to me!
All right...
Dad. Mum. Saroo.
Mm-hmm.
- Mantosh.
- Yes.
Yeah...
Hello again.
Oh, Saroo, my goodness.
Look at you!
- Hey.
- Hi.
Oh, my gosh,
we've been so excited.
- This is Mantosh.
- Hi!
Hi, Mantosh.
This is Saroo. I'm Sue.
Hello.
This is Saroo, your brother.
- And John.
- Hello, mate.
Show...
Show Mantosh what you made.
- Oh...
- Oh...
- Saroo did a picture.
- Yeah.
- It's been a long flight.
- Yes, yes, yes.
You must be hungry.
- We're going to go get something to eat.
- Yeah.
- Would you, um...
- Yeah.
Would you like to join us?
Oh, okay. That would be nice.
Hey.
- John, stop him, stop him.
- Hey, hey.
He's hurting his leg.
He's hurting his leg.
No, no, no. No, no, no, gentle.
You're all right.
- No, no, it's okay. It's all right.
- Come on.
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
John, John.
- I know, I know, I know.
- Come on, come on, let's go.
No, no, no. - Hey, mate.
- It's all right. Play.
- It's okay, mate.
You just play with your toys.
No, no, no,
don't hit, mate.
Don't-don't hit. Don't hit.
Don't hit yourself.
Don't hit yourself.
No, no, not your head.
Not your head!
- Come on.
- You're right. You're right.
You're right.
It's okay, it's okay.
Come on.
I know. It's okay, mate.
It's okay.
Hey, look, it's the boats.
It's better now.
Sweetheart. Shh.
I'm okay.
Hey.
I'm all right.
Yes, well, you pay extra for
all the bubbles in this one.
We're going to miss you.
- Okay...
- Yeah.
It's only Melbourne.
- I know.
- No, it's across the water.
Saroo.
Our beautiful boy.
May this bring you
all that you could wish for.
Yeah.
And then some.
Thanks, Mum. Thanks, Dad.
From the moment
you came into our lives...
- Mum.
- No, no, no, let me finish.
From the moment
you came into our lives,
you were all that we could
have hoped for.
Yeah.
More. More than
we hoped for, really.
And, uh... more work,
that's for sure.
You've really embraced
every opportunity.
Yeah, we're very proud
of you, son.
Very proud and very excited
for this next
- chapter in your life.
- Yeah.
- Cheers.
- To success.
Excuse me, guys, are you
still waiting on someone?
- Or can I take this plate away?
- Yeah, you can take it away.
- No, no, no, you can leave it.
- No, take it.
I'd like to keep it.
Thank you.
You don't really think
he'll turn up, do you?
No, just leave it, son.
Mm. That's a nice one.
Yeah, it's a good one,
this one. It's a local one.
Mantosh.
Yeah, sorry I didn't make lunch.
What's that course again?
Hotel management.
So you're going to go
and learn to what?
Manage a hotel?
Well, have fun.
Any bills you need to pay?
You can give us a job
when you come back.
Please, could you not do
anything while I'm away...
- Yeah, yeah.
- ...that's gonna make Mum
more unhappy
than you already do.
Mate...
Why do you think I stay away?
<i>We see ourselves
as the United Nations</i>
<i>of hospitality schools,</i>
<i>and we like to think
we teach a global</i>
and balanced perspective.
You're here because
you have a dream.
We're here to help make
that dream a reality.
<i>Yeah, and I saw first-hand</i>
how the hospitality industry
can really bring infrastructure
to communities that need it.
But I also saw a lot of
the problems that they cause.
Which is why community groups
need to be involved
every step of the way
and they need to be
taken seriously.
And I guess I want to help
facilitate that
and help give them a voice.
Saroo.
I want to run hotels
that put all the profits
into my pocket.
Well, let's, uh...
start with where you're from,
shall we?
So, born in Australia?
Yeah. No, uh, Calcutta.
I've got family in Kolkata.
My cousins there are quite mad.
Which part?
I'm adopted.
I'm not really Indian.
But you like cricket,
though, right?
Ah, you like cricket.
You go for the Aussies
or the Indians?
- Only the Aussies, mate.
- Oh, only the Aussies, mate!
Yeah, this is going to be
interesting.
Okay, Saroo, um...
why did you choose this course,
and what else
do you want to get out of it?
Hi.
- Hi. How are you?
- Welcome.
- Thanks for coming. Come in.
- Thank you.
- It's so good to see you.
- Mm, smells so good in here.
Hi.
Hi. How are you?
I hope you guys
like Indian food.
'Cause that's all we have.
That's all we have!
Oh, it smells so good.
I tried to copy some
of my mom's recipes.
Have you ever done
any Bollywood dancing?
- Oh, just, like, one leg?
- Yeah, yeah, one leg.
That's good!
You're on your way!
Okay, well, like, I say
flashlight. What do you say?
<i>- Lampe de poche.
- "Lampe de poche."</i>
Flashlight is, um... <i>budhi.</i>
- Oh.
- So fancy.
- What do you say?
- Torch.
If you want to eat
with your hand, you need to...
- use the naan like a spoon.
- Use the fork, Saroo.
- No, let him use the naan.
- No.
Okay, well, how do you say taxi?
- Taxi.
- Taxi.
It's the same in every language.
- You want a fork, Saroo?
- Let him try.
No, no, no, it's hard for him.
Just like my father.
- Want another beer?
- Yes, please. Thank you.
I still think you're crazy
for living anywhere in Africa.
<i>Guddu...</i>
Saroo...
Are you okay?
Saroo?
I'm not from Calcutta.
I'm lost.
Howrah Station is enormous.
You must have been freaking out.
I once went through there
on a pilgrimage to Puri,
and I missed
my connection twice.
And you didn't speak Bengali?
I didn't even know
it was called that.
How long were you on the train?
- A couple of days.
- Couple of days?
Saroo, what was
your hometown again?
Ganestalay.
I must have had it wrong,
'cause it doesn't exist.
But there must be something
else that you do remember.
Oh...
The platform...
I fell asleep on
had this big rain tank.
- And it was only a few stops from Ganestalay.
- Huh.
Well, there are thousands
of stations with rain tanks.
Look, it was a...
a long time ago.
Have you heard of this
new program, Google Earth?
- Ah.
- It's incredible.
You can find any place
from anywhere.
Listen to me.
We can find out how fast
passenger trains went back then.
We take that speed,
multiply it by the hours
that you were on the train.
That's it.
We create a search radius.
And inside there, you'll find
the station with the rain tank.
Yeah, but it would take
a lifetime to search
all the stations in India.
You... did I say
all the stations?
Okay, even half the stations...
Really, guys, I don't want
to talk about this.
Did your parents try
to find you?
- What?
- Of course they tried to find him.
No, I just mean, like,
you know, if they tried
to find him,
maybe they left, like,
a paper trail or something.
What paper trail?
He didn't know his surname.
My mum couldn't read or write.
What did she do?
A laborer.
She carried rocks.
Your mum?
Hey. Just...
My mom died about, uh,
four years ago now.
I'm sorry.
My dad is just
still so angry at her.
I mean, not for getting sick,
obviously,
but just for refusing chemo.
But she just knew herself,
you know?
She knew what her terms were,
and she knew how
she wanted to live, so...
He just couldn't accept that,
I guess.
And how do you feel?
Mm, I just miss her.
What do you think of Bharat's
search radius idea?
What is that?
Is that your dancing?
Is that how you dance?
Oh, God!
Hi.
You can't keep
going on like this.
Let me help you.
Come on, let's go for a run.
What?
Lucy!
Come on.
Hold on. I've got a cramp.
You're a... a cheat!
Whoo! Whoo!
I never show anybody these.
Why? They're beautiful.
I do enjoy it.
My little hobby.
- Oh, wow, look at Mantosh.
- Mm-hmm.
I'm so glad he's coming tonight.
Cheeky little thing.
Pure energy...
but incredible.
So sweet.
He's been hard to control,
but...
very, very smart and very...
I mean, he could do anything
if he just learned
to control that energy.
He could do it, do it all.
Saroo's very protective of him.
I've been blessed.
Very blessed.
Your mom showed me, um,
all your old little trophies.
Mum, you didn't.
Mmm.
I had no idea
you were so athletic.
Oh, that's only half of them.
There's plenty more
in the garage.
- Dad.
- Hey, where you going, mate?
Just finishing my smoke.
I can barely get him
off the couch these days.
Lucy.
Why can't you just tell them
what you've been up to?
Don't.
Tell us.
They would understand.
They would support you.
What? Come on.
Hey, um, dinner. Mmm.
Well, eat it while it's hot.
- You hungry?
- Yeah.
What?
- What have I missed?
- Nothing.
- She looks upset.
- She's not upset.
You don't know how I feel.
Saroo knows everything.
He's an expert.
Oh.
He's a manager.
Why are you here?
He's here
because he's your brother.
- No, he's not.
- Oh...
- We're different.
- Hey. Now, now, Saroo!
Saroo.
All right.
Hey. Hey, come on.
It's all right.
- Hey, hey. Now, now, it's okay.
- All right.
Hey, it's okay.
It's okay...
- It's all right, it's all right.
- Just breathe.
- Stop!
- It's okay. It's okay.
Don't move.
It's... it's okay.
Nice one, mate.
Hey, hey, it's okay, mate.
It's okay.
Just breathe, mate.
Just breathe. It's okay.
I hate what he's done to you.
I'm sorry.
Saroo!
Saroo!
Saroo!
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.
- Good to see you.
- Yeah.
Hey.
Be with me.
Stop. Luce.
Hey, look at me.
Look at me.
- Can this wait?
- Where are you?
Let's go. Can this wait
till we get home, yeah?
Home?
- Hey.
- What home?
You mean where I'm alone
in one room
and you're alone
in the other room? Come on.
Stop it, Luce. Stop it.
Come on.
Stop it, Lucy.
Saroo!
You need to face reality!
What do you mean, reality?
Do you have any idea
what it's like
knowing my real brother
and mother
spend every day of their lives
looking for me?
- What?
- Huh?
How every day my real brother
screams my name?
Can you imagine
the pain they must be in
not knowing where I am?
Huh?
25 years, Luce.
25!
Why didn't you tell me
that was happening for you?
We swum about
in our privileged lives.
It makes me sick.
I have to find home.
They need to know I'm okay.
I have never stopped you.
I want to help.
I can't do this anymore.
You deserve more.
Don't you do that.
Don't you dare do that.
This is on you, not on me.
<i>Saroo!</i>
<i>Saroo!</i>
Saroo?
Saroo!
Saroo? You there, mate?
There's a One Day
International tomorrow.
You can come over if you like.
Oh, I meant to tell you
I fixed the tiller.
Why don't we take her out?
We can head up the coast.
Hey, Saroo?
Mate, your mum's not, um...
Look, we've lost track of
Mantosh. He's missing again.
You know how worried she gets.
We know you quit your job, mate.
Just worried about you, son.
I've been visiting her.
Every night,
I walk those streets home.
Home from the dam.
Home from the station.
And I know every single step
of the way.
And I imagine that I'm...
...whispering in her ear,
<i>"Ammi,</i> it's all right."
What was she like?
Beautiful.
How was New York?
It was the same.
So what brings you back?
Our funding came through.
That's great.
See?
They know how good you are.
I miss you.
I saw your mom.
She's not doing very well.
I'm worried it'll kill her
if she knew I was searching.
You underestimate her.
She needs you.
No, Give me five rupees.
...then I'll carry them all.
Okay, you win, take this.
He was carrying a watermelon
and didn't see it coming.
What?
What if you do find home
and they're not even there?
And you never stop
and you just keep searching?
You don't know what
happens over time. Things...
...change.
Entire worlds change.
I don't have a choice.
Stay.
I can't.
Stay right there.
Weren't you supposed to look after him?
Where were you?
Don't you love him?
John heard Mantosh
is out on the boats.
Doing a lobster run.
He's due back tomorrow.
So he'll be flush for cash.
Back on the hard stuff.
I'm sorry you couldn't have
your own kids.
- What are you saying?
- I mean...
we...
weren't blank pages, were we?
Like your own would have been.
You weren't just adopting us
but our pasts as well, and...
And I feel like
we're killing you.
I could have had kids.
- What?
- We chose not to have kids.
We wanted the two of you.
That's what we wanted.
We wanted the two of you
in our lives.
That's what we chose.
That's one of the reasons
I fell in love with your dad.
Because we both felt that the...
...the world has
enough people in it.
Have a child,
that wouldn't have guaranteed
we were going to make
anything better,
but to take a child that's
suffering like you boys were...
...give you a chance
in the world...
...that's something.
I bet you never imagined it
being this hard.
It's not a matter of hard.
It's not a Matt...
There's only one path for me,
and that's how I think.
That's how this happened,
because...
...when I was 12,
I had a vision.
Some people would say
that it was a...
it was a breakdown, but it...
My dad was alcoholic, you know
that, and he was like...
he was...
he wasn't a good man.
He was... he was
out of control, and I was...
I was standing out the back
of our house,
I was looking out
across this field...
...and I just wanted the earth
to swallow me up, and...
...and I...
I felt an electric current.
It was like a shock,
like a... a jolt,
through my whole body.
And then I saw a brown-skinned
child across that field.
And then he was standing
beside me,
and it was right there, and I
could feel it so strongly.
And for the first time in
my life, I felt something good.
I felt... good.
And I knew it was guiding me,
and I knew that I was
going to be fine.
It was as if at that moment
I could see it.
I could see my future
right there.
Because I always thought
that I could keep
this family together.
And now...
Now I don't know where...
- Mum.
- What's happening?
I don't understand.
You don't talk to me anymore.
I need you, Saroo.
Mantosh!
I'm sorry for what I said
at dinner.
Guddu.
Ganesh Talai.
Ganesh Talai.
Ganestalay.
Mum.
I found home.
What?
Please wait for me.
I'll be here.
So this is where you've been.
I didn't want you to feel
I was ungrateful.
There wasn't a day
I didn't want to tell you.
Saroo.
I really hope she's there.
She needs to see
how beautiful you are.
Hey.
I used to live here.
I used to...
Can I help?
Um... uh...
That's me.
I'm Saroo.
I used to live here.
You lived here?
Here, yes.
Yeah, I used to live here.
I'm-I'm looking for, uh...
Guddu, Kallu, uh, Shekila.
My mother.
Come.
- Come where?
- Come with me.
Just come.
<i>Ammi?</i>
Saroo!
Saroo. Saroo.
Oh, how I looked for you!
- Saroo. Saroo. Saroo.
- Sorry.
Saroo.
Saroo.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
It's okay.
Yeah? The watermelons.
<i>Watermelon.</i>
Yeah.
Saroo.
And Guddu?
Where's Guddu?
- Where is he?
- Guddu...
Guddu is no more.
He's with God.
Guddu.
- Shekila.
- Shekila?
Shekila?
He's your brother!
She's so big.
It's me, Saroo.
She's beautiful.
<i>Hi, Mum.</i>
<i>I know you'll be sound asleep.</i>
<i>I just want to say
that I'm safe.</i>
<i>I'm safe, and the questions
have been answered.</i>
<i>There are no more dead ends.</i>
<i>I've found my mother, and...</i>
<i>she thanks you both
for raising me.</i>
<i>She understands
that you're my family.</i>
<i>She's...</i>
...happy just knowing I'm alive.
I've found her, but that
doesn't change who you are.
I love you, Mum, so much.
And you, Dad.
And Mantosh.
C'mon!
Let's go!
Come on!
Saroo!
Let's go!
Walk faster!
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going!
Oh, you're gonna fall!
<i>- Saroo!
- Guddu!</i>
<i>- Saroo!
- Guddu!</i>
