April the 10th 1671.
M. Le Prince de Condé,
his Majesty gives me reasons
to believe that he would accept
an invitation
to visit you at Chantilly.
The visit will last 3 days.
The King instructs me to say
that he wants no fuss.
Merely the simple pleasures
of life in the country.
In other words,
if you value his Majesty's favor,
you will set no limit
to the extravagance and ingenuity
of the festivities.
I will present myself beforehand
to approve the arrangements.
Marquis de Lauzun,
in the service of his Majesty,
Louis XIV of France.
On that table!
Good morning, Monsieur.
Good morning.
The Princess's apartments
are at the disposal of the Queen.
Naturally I shall place mine
at the disposal of his Majesty.
From the King's anti-chambre,
we pass through the music room.
And next,
to the apartments of the Queen.
Her Majesty's bedroom,
drawing room,
and a further bedroom beyond
for her Majesty's lady-in-waiting.
Lady-in-waiting.
Madame de Montausier.
Madame de Montausier.
Anne de Montausier.
Her Majesty will be comfortable,
and convenient.
The King won't be going to her bed,
he did his duty 2 clays ago.
Remarkably well informed.
The Queen confesses
the morning after...
- When was it?
- Monday.
Remarkably well informed...
This room is to serve as
the Council Chamber and...
the King's bedroom.
And a second bedroom through here,
with access also
from the private corridor.
And this of course,
we have allocated
to the Duchesse de la Valliere.
This room is for
the Marquise de Montespan.
And La Valliere?
Anywhere. Put her in the attic.
I prefer it, M. Le Prince,
if my rooms were north facing.
- I don't like the sun coming in.
- Your rooms, Lauzun?
I myself will manage
with only one room
as well as the Princess.
Every corner and cupboard
is spoken for.
Even so to accommodate the Court
we have to use every farmhouse
for miles around.
MY room?
No.
I won't have you disturbed, Vatel.
You haven't slept for a week
as it is.
Have that cleaned!
The first day. The glory of sun,
the bounty of nature.
Trees, birds, butterflies,
fruits and flowers.
The second day, on the lake,
fireworks.
The sun banishes the night.
The lamps are on their way
from Paris.
For Friday, the fish banquet
will be presented on a sea of ice.
Neptune's tribute to Helios,
the Sun God.
The King will catch cold.
No, the braziers will be lit
one hour before the banquet.
Then the ice will melt.
I have forbidden it to melt,
my Prince.
Our fate is in your hands.
<i>The first day, noon.</i>
Good day to you.
How can I help you?
Excuse me sir, we'll only talk
to the top, nobody else.
I regret his Majesty is busy
at this moment.
His host, the Prince de Condé,
likewise.
Not them.
The man in charge,
the Master of Pleasures
and Festivities: Vatel.
Slightly more difficult.
I'll see what I can do.
Please follow.
- How many geese?
- 60, Monsieur.
You're trespassing here,
M. Alcalet.
All of us are owed money.
We've come to tell you.
From this moment, nothing on credit.
Not a single cabbage leaf
or a cracked coffee cup
or a table napkin,
nothing until our bills are paid!
We have businesses to run
and families to provide for.
- When will we get what we're owed?
- You are only owed the truth.
As things stand,
we cannot honor our debts.
Not for the months and years gone by,
still less for these festivities.
We cannot pay you a single sou,
nor will we ever.
You have only one chance
of getting your money.
By giving me everything I ask for,
instantly.
And of the very best quality
and then more of the same.
This visit is a reconciliation.
If the King is pleased
by the festivities,
then the royal coffers will open.
It's up to you.
If we give you more credit,
will we get our money back?
The Prince has said so.
My master is a man of honor.
On that I stake my life.
You will be paid.
Excellent.
Are you going down, Madame?
I'm going up.
Where is Montausier?
Explain to her the Queen
does not wait on her lady-in-waiting!
Forgive me, Madame.
Let me...
Allow me.
I hope your birds
will be happy with us.
- That's good.
- Oui, Monsieur.
What do you think, your Highness?
Effiat, Monsieur has chosen
the boy already.
Here we are!
Put him in with the fruit...
There, you need a wash.
Effiat, get in! Get in with...
with him.
M. The King's brother
wants him for his page.
He chose me.
Get him dressed and put him to work.
And...
What would you have me
tell his Highness,
the King's brother?
Tell him I don't get my boys
from his boudoir.
And he won't get his from my kitchen.
Indeed, I will.
It's not very wise upsetting
the King's brother.
He could make things go badly for us
if he chooses.
The Princess
has been bitten... by a monkey!
Master Steward, you've filled
my garden with savage beasts!
I've been badly bitten.
Where were you?
Busy, your Highness.
Some unwelcome visitors.
Beggars?
Creditors.
Creditors!
Doctor Bourdelot!
I've been badly bitten...
on the arm.
I heard of a poultice
made of rose petals.
What's your name?
You were at Vaux-le-Vicomte
10 years ago.
Yes, Madame.
I was steward to Nicolas Fouquet.
His Majesty's Minister of Finance.
You mean his Majesty's prisoner
for life in the fortress of Pignerol.
That is so.
That was my first banquet.
Six thousand guests to meet the King.
Diamonds and saddle horses given away
as prizes in childish games.
That was overdoing it,
don't you think?
It showed how much
Fouquet had been stealing.
Gourville, why has the King
really come here?
Revenge.
He will never forget that Condé
fought against him in the civil war.
That was a long time ago.
The King was a child.
If there's a war with the Dutch,
the King will need Condé,
so your part in this,
is to show the King
we bow the head
and bend the knee.
I'm passing red hot stones.
What exactly do you need to borrow
so much money for?
The better to serve France,
your Majesty.
Aren't our envoys from Holland
here yet?
Not yet, your Majesty.
Peace with the Dutch is good
for nothing. Except tulips.
How many tulips do we have
at Versailles?
Two million, Sire.
And my gardener hates flowers.
He would love a war with the Dutch.
Indeed, Sire.
Would your Majesty please recall
that you have offered your daughter
in marriage to William of Orange?
An invasion would not look well
following a betrothal.
My daughter can't even talk yet.
Colbert!
We must secure our eastern frontier.
4 clays ride from Paris, we have
a country of Republicans, Protestants
and printers of seditious pamphlets.
We have no better soldier than Condé.
If there is a war, we'll need him.
He's expensive.
But if there's peace...
What do I say in the meantime?
Why Say anything?
Your Majesty was invited here
to enjoy yourself.
Not for business.
Your Highness!
Are the musicians ready?
Yes, my Prince.
The King did not utter
a civil word to me.
He kept muttering to Lauzun.
Bastard!
My son has died
working your machines
at Versailles!
He died so you can have fountains
at Versailles!
Have you no control over your people?
His Majesty wants her flogged
at once.
See to it, Master Steward.
I'm not your Master
of flogging madwomen.
A hundred lashes.
You know what's at stake.
Don't weaken!
But he died! My son died
so the King can have his fountains!
I am short of a page at my household
at Saint Cloud.
You have a boy who might do
apparently.
Send him to my apartement
and I'll have a look at him.
Come, Lauzun,
we have been promised music.
Music is my weakness.
The madwoman has been flogged,
your Majesty.
I ask your pardon.
Madwoman?
Don't concern yourself, Prince.
I recall no madwoman.
No sign of them.
How long are they going to be?
You can't hurry a King.
You can't slow down a sunset!
Madame...
Monsieur le Marquis?
The King sends you his compliments.
He begs the favour of taking
a cup of chocolate with you
in your room at midnight.
With me?
May I offer you my congratulations?
Although, as you can imagine,
this came as a great blow to me.
After tonight,
I cannot hope for deliverance
from the pain of my own desires.
May I Suggest...
my rooms at ten?
Alas, Monsieur,
at ten o'clock
I have an even more attractive offer.
Her Majesty has asked me
to de-louse her spaniel.
Madame!
He's coming! Thank God.
Quicker!
Table one.
With your King, eat, drink
and enjoy yourselves!
We have to be perfect. Go, go!
The Prince's gout is bad.
Tell Dr. Bourdelot.
Mme de Courbe needs a new napkin.
Le Marquis d'Effiat wants his dish
without coriander.
Isn't it to your taste, your Majesty?
Change Montespan for Montausier.
You look pale, Prince. Are you ill?
Your Majesty is gracious
to enquire...
Yes, indeed.
I see we share the same taste.
Taste?
In women.
There is a lady
who has been rejecting my advances
in a way
which I find quite stimulating.
Her world is about to change.
The King has asked for her tonight.
I suggest we mark the event.
I want you to make a masterpiece.
Spun sugar, almond paste...
fruit, flowers.
I'll leave it to you.
I'm not a patissier, Marquis.
You were apprenticed at Eberhardt's
on the Ile Saint Louis.
I'll be too busy.
Ask someone else, Marquis.
Fruit and flowers in the colour
of flesh and blood.
Flesh...
and blood.
I'll send my valet in the morning.
Young sires, behave yourselves!
- Don't you know who I am?
- I do not have the honor.
I am the Vicomte d'Amboise.
And when I grow up,
I'll be the Duc de la Tremoille!
In that case, it is not too soon
to learn how to behave
like the Duc de la Tremoille.
In truth, the Duc de la Tremoille
behaves like a pig.
I thank you, Madame.
The poorest of the poor
picked those flowers,
just for a few sous,
to make the trees pretty
for his Majesty
and those sous were on credit.
But the poor are happy
to be the King's creditors.
It's an honor
they never dreamed of.
Of course.
Both my parents were so honored
they died of it.
The Prince's birds!
Oh, God! I cannot believe this.
Where are my birds?
The Vicomte ordered to let them go.
What Vicomte?
The Vicomte d'Amboise and his sister.
They ordered me.
But they're children.
Little children!
He is still a Vicomte.
But these are the birds
of the Prince!
What am I going to do?
I mean, it's a disaster!
I specially ordered those thrushes
and larks for the Prince's gout.
His gout is giving him agony today!
What will I do?
Use something else.
Use something else?
Use something else!
The heart torn from the living bird
is the only treatment for gout.
Everyone knows that!
- Why not chickens?
- Chickens!
He's a Prince!
Chicken hearts wouldn't even
cure a peasant!
The King is bored.
It's a disaster for Condé.
Are you trying to ruin me?
Your Highness?
First that madwoman.
Now Lauzun tells me
you have been insolent.
Insolent?
You refused to be of service to him.
I refused to be his patissier.
What is the matter with you?
Lauzun has the King's ear.
For the next few clays,
do what he asks.
Bravo, Prince! Bravo!
Gourville!
Have they put you to spy on me?
If they had,
you'd be in the Bastille by now.
You despise them, don't you?
I don't despise anyone
who does his duty.
Tell me, Gourville,
who is Anne de Montausier?
Why?
How many times have I bitten
my tongue?
Now I snap at the only one
who is humane to me.
She's the tastiest morceau at court
many have tasted, or so they say.
Where are we going?
Good.
Yes, it'd better be perfect.
Colbert is hostile to our Prince
gaining influence at Court.
He's not in our camp.
The Prince made a remark tonight
about war...
There are rumours...
- Yes, but he is...
- Sick of war?
So he is.
But he's equally sick
of being in debt.
Your Majesty.
Madame de Montausier.
I'm concerned about the fish.
I've sent to Dieppe
for an extra cartload,
in case of storms off Le Havre.
You are my general.
The battle plan is yours to decide.
What else?
Nothing, unless it rains.
The carving squires will have
to sleep in a stable,
but they're Germans.
The lanterns arrive in the morning.
Very good.
Well, I'll leave it to you.
Go to bed, my friend.
You did well.
<i>The second day.</i>
Can you tell me where Vatel is?
You sent for me, Monsieur Vatel?
Food for cattle.
Now we can feed cattle
through the winter
instead of slaughtering them
every year.
How many varieties of pear
are there?
There are 500 different kinds
of pear.
This is the best one.
Its name is?
Bon Chrétien d'Hiver.
And?
It was known to the Romans.
Good.
When I am rich,
I'd like a garden like yours.
I hope so, Colin. I hope so.
Bravo, you made a good choice.
The King will be pleased.
Colin, don't leave the kitchen
without my order.
They were badly packed
and the roads were bad...
I am the valet
of the Marquis de Lauzun.
My commiserations.
Thank you.
Good.
Now a real flower.
Give me the blue one.
Harmony and contrast.
All beauty
comes from those two things.
You see, few objects
are beautiful or ugly in themselves.
To know that
is the beginning of being an artist.
Now, I'll show you
a real masterpiece.
For your mistress.
Just a moment.
It's from the Marquis de Lauzun.
Send it back.
She doesn't want it.
Will you keep me with you
when you are a Duchess?
Let's wait and see
if I am to be a Duchess
or just a night's divertissement
to keep Mme de Montespan on her toes.
Or on her knees.
Know Phedre then,
and all her wild desires.
I'm in love.
With a fish?
Monsieur le Marquis.
What?
She refused it.
That's rather beautiful.
Senditto...
the Duchesse de Longueville.
With the note?
Of course!
There's far too much waste
in this country.
Do not suppose that loving you,
I think myself innocent
or approve myself.
I am the victim
of Celestium Vengeance
and hate myself still more
than you detest me.
Civilize, Madame, civilize...
There still won't be enough meat.
Not with the extra guests.
Monsieur, I'm worried
about the meat.
We have scarcely enough.
M. The King's brother
has got the whale!
This is, lover, death...
The frightful monster
must not get away!
Here is my heart.
It is there your hand should strike.
Already I cannot face
that I may prick it.
Strike now!
Or if you think me
not worth a blow...
Your men are careless.
They spoiled our pleasure.
My men had orders to wait for me.
The whale was intended
for the King's pleasure.
The King! That's a shame.
We, Bourbons, are...
unpredictable when deprived of our...
pleasure.
You are a stubborn man,
Master Steward.
Admirable!
Horse racing!
Get that carcass out of the water.
For your mistress.
It must be from the King!
There's a note.
It's sugar.
It's all right, Louise.
It's all right.
<i>Madame,</i>
<i>you were kind
to one who turned aside kindness.</i>
<i>Such gifts as I have,
I employ for your forgiveness.</i>
<i>François Vatel.</i>
Gourville, help me.
The table lanterns were smashed
on the journey.
If the wind gets up,
it will blow out the candles.
Torches would be dangerous.
Fires of Bengal burn better
then tallow,
but the scent will ruin
the taste of the food.
The banquet will be a failure.
It's just a hot meal
on its way to the commode.
No, Gourville.
It's the future
of the House of Condé.
If you were a gambler,
you'd appreciate
a whole new human pleasure.
The risk of losing everything.
My advice is: Enjoy your disasters.
But don't ever stake your soul.
I'd sell it today
for the weather to hold.
Master Steward,
do you promise us sport?
Yes, there will be sport.
I smell blood.
I promise you blood.
Montausier's stock is rising.
She spent the night
in his Majesty's bed.
Does everybody know
who sleeps with the King?
Every footman knows.
Sometimes,
you can be quite ridiculous!
You find the day more exciting
than the night, Madame?
You sent back my gift and my note.
Do you think
the King intends to keep you?
Perhaps not, Lauzun,
but from the King's bed to yours
is a long fall.
I am not contemplating it
in this life.
Mme de Longueville.
They're waiting for the sauces!
Pick this up. Someone help him!
M. Vatel, the pies!
There is not enough meat!
We're two tables short.
They gave us the wrong numbers.
Give me this.
Bring me some mushrooms!
Antoine, mushrooms!
Are you all right?
It's nothing!
GO! Go!
Condé has won 40,000 pistols
from the King.
Colbert must be furious.
By losing a little,
you might have won more.
By winning a little,
you might lose everything.
Is the Prince losing his chéteau?
Not if he plays his cards wrong.
Your Majesty.
He'd better lose, Condé!
Condé's demands are excessive.
Outrageous.
You mean he knows his price.
Of course, if there were
to be a war...
I'm sure my friend M. De Turenne
would forgive the monies
he loaned his Majesty last year.
Condé is a better leader.
As yet, there is no war.
Our envoys from Holland
may well bring acceptable terms.
I would prefer that.
It is not rational
for two rich countries
to make war.
My dear Colbert,
our destinies
are not ruled by reason.
Lust for power, like any lust,
is seated,
according to latest
medical knowledge, in the liver.
Although personally,
it hasn't been my experience.
Are you ill, Madame?
An infusion of this will restore you.
I wanted the wind to stop blowing.
I made it stop.
I thought it was God.
Then perhaps God provided me.
Is it so important?
It is no small thing
to please a King.
To please a King is easily clone
and of no importance.
But as a steward,
I have it in my power
to save the house
of the Prince of Condé.
What power do you have?
To create.
To astonish.
The visit of his Majesty
is the supreme test.
If I please him,
his benevolence will restore
my master to his position
in the destiny of France.
So the destiny of France
is in your hands.
That will be a great surprise
to the King's minister Colbert!
I must go back.
You really believe
Lauzun has enough influence...
Trust me, my dearest.
I've never let you down... have I?
Stay late after dinner.
I'll need the room.
I don't feel like ruining my gown
in the corner of some stable.
Is this what the Court
has brought us to?
Laurent! Laurent!
What kind of meat is this?
Unicorn. Laurent!
M. Demaury.
Hurry up! Hurry up!
For God's sake.
There's no news about the lanterns.
More than half the eggs are addled.
We can't make the custard.
Watch.
Come.
The sugar will come up
like beaten egg whites.
Don't forget the apricot!
If they ask you what it is,
tell them
it's an old recipe from Chantilly.
Don't cut any more melons.
Who is it?
Don't be afraid. Come on.
My mistress...
She asked me to stay until
I have seen you read it.
This is so pretty!
What a strange idea!
- A custom from India.
- India!
Please thank your mistress.
My clock has stopped.
Does it matter?
All the other clocks in this chéteau
are working perfectly.
By the way,
the King stopped to examine
the sun clock and admired it.
It means something.
I stink from head to toe.
This is good. I don't know it.
It's made from walnuts.
What did you want?
Monsieur sent me...
It's not an easy embassy.
Your name is on everybody's lips.
This banquet will be decisive.
Your genius is...
Get to the point.
Monsieur wants you for his friend.
He admires...
Well, he admires you
and to speak quite frankly,
everything about you, so...
What he wants from you is...
everything.
Do I hear you right?
- What do you hear?
- That Monsieur has sent you
to ask me to join the long line
of stableboys and princes
who he has honoured so...
intimately?
Yes, your hearing is very good.
Tell Monsieur,
and I quote Descartes,
who I once knew:
"There is no soul so weak
that it cannot acquire
"an absolute power
over the passions."
Monsieur is not a Cartesian,
as far as is known.
He only wants a few moments
of your time.
Then I'll send him a message
which reveals more of me
than he would ever see
if I were to submit.
Tell him:
We both of us
live with a terrible thing,
a desire for the absolute,
the sublime, the perfect.
That's why he? Its
from person to person,
and that's why I give myself
to no one.
And the Prince?
How long do you think it will take
before this reaches the Prince?
Not long if you hurry.
My dear Vatel.
We all go round together
like a celestial machine.
The Sun King is at the center.
Condé is one of his planets
and I am Condé's moon.
Do you think there is a place
to stand where we are free?
Naturally I will speak to Condé.
Not to do so would be...
self-important.
More fruit on table six.
Bourdelot!
Why have you got
Mme de Montausier's birds?
I got them from Mme de Montausier.
- I'm saving them for the banquet.
- For the banquet?
No. In case the Prince requires them
for his gout.
But Why?
The Princess asked La Montausier
to sacrifice her canaries.
She refused.
So the Princess told her Majesty
and she commanded La Montausier
to give them to me.
Her Majesty.
But canaries,
they are so small, I don't think
their hearts will be enough
to ease the Prince's pain.
You see, this rich food
is very bad for his gout.
I can't serve him an omelette
to celebrate
the visit of the King of France.
It's not your fault.
I just wish I had some better birds,
that's all.
I have my parrots.
But surely, Vatel,
you would not sacrifice...
If the Prince's pain
gets too great to bear
then send to me for my parrots.
Tell the Princess
canaries are too small.
Demaury!
Return those birds
to Madame de Montausier's room.
The Duc de Longueville
is drinking too heavily,
serve him a lighter wine.
A candle has gone out on table six.
Angel drops!
Condé is lucky, this banquet
would shame a Roman Emperor.
Who is this Vatel?
Where does he come from?
Nowhere. The slums of Paris.
He was apprenticed at Eberhardt's,
I believe.
Eberhardt's?
On the Ile Saint Louis?
My mother swore by Eberhardt's.
So did your father, I believe,
although I don't think
he went there for the pastries.
Vatel!
I was just telling the Duchess here
about your boyhood days in
the brothels of the Ile Saint Louis.
It's quite true.
No one knows more about
the brothels of the Ile Saint Louis
than the Marquis de Lauzun.
I think he's just insulted you,
but it's hard to tell.
That's a rare gift.
If you punish him for it, I'll tell
everyone your favorite perversion.
But Duchesse,
you will be the last to know.
Monsieur, you let us taste flavors
one shall never forget.
As a rule I don't allow the King
to be served vinegar.
It makes him irritable,
particularly around his anus.
Fetch Bourdelot!
From India?
How beautiful, ingenious.
I have learned something today,
which is rare.
- I need something...
- Are you in pain?
No, I'm in the grip of some anxiety.
Anxiety? I have nothing for anxiety.
I am a doctor.
GO, go!
And now... For you!
And one and two and three and four,
and more and more.
I am the Steward of the Fish.
They tell me these carp
are called love-carp.
Can you tell us why?
Yes, why? Tell us, tell us why?
They have thick lips
for kissing the stone banks.
Gourville gave me your message.
You understand me like none
of my friends understand me.
I hope you find your perfection.
I know I'm looking
in the wrong place,
but when I despair
I shall remember there was a man
who looked into my soul.
Sport...
I demand there shall be a race
between... Effiat
and the carp!
Effiat, now!
It's clouding over.
I'm worried about the salvoes
from up here.
There's a lot of humidity
coming up off the canal.
It may even rain.
It wouldn't dare. He's not called
the Sun King for nothing.
Bravo, sir,
but save your voice for the King.
His ear, as we know, is perfect,
as of course, is his nose,
his navel and his big toe.
Monsieur Vatel, they are ready.
The horses are ready.
Come on.
What a wonderful spectacle.
Condé, who is responsible
for these marvels?
My Steward, your Majesty.
And what is his name?
Bring me this Vatel.
I would like to congratulate him.
Sixteen thousand pounds of flares
and rockets gone up in smoke
to kill a groom.
The King wishes to speak to you.
Not now, please.
Does he think all this
happens by itself!
I want everything cleared up by dawn.
Understand?
- Is it Friday already?
- Yes, nearly.
I must send Demaury
to look out for the fish.
The roads are bad.
Jean-Marie Benoud is dead.
You must tell his family.
I know.
I've sent a messenger to tell them.
The Queen is asking
for crystalized fruits.
Well, get some!
For her Majesty.
Her Majesty.
Lauzun! Don't go away, Lauzun.
The King has called for Vatel.
He's refused to come.
He claims he's too busy.
Do you know the story
of the Marquis de Cufevent?
Everybody does, Monsieur.
Tell it to me, clear Lauzun.
Tell us, tell it, Lauzun.
It seems,
as the Marquis bowed for the King,
he let out a tremendous fart...
And so his Majesty made him
Master of the King's Music.
And what moral do you see
in that story, Lauzun?
That if you don't give a fart
for music,
you'll never rise at Court.
I'll pass his message on to the King.
Halt!
- What is your business?
- The King's business!
Envoys from Holland!
Let me go. Let me pass.
The black queen loses, Colbert.
I am only trying to help.
Your Majesty, my hand needs
all the help it can get.
If Colbert loses, he won't be able
to pay our workmen at Versailles.
Are you alright?
Well, Monsieur, don't deal
in the black queen.
How many orange trees
do we have, Colbert?
One thousand, your Majesty.
And one hundred in silver tubs.
Versailles is my favorite mistress.
That's why she costs you so much.
What are you staking, Prince?
Fifteen Louis.
Fifteen Louis!
How many fountains
do we have, Colbert?
One and a half thousand,
your Majesty.
Forfait.
For Versailles if I lose.
For something of yours if I win...
A glove, perhaps, mon frére.
But one glove is no good to anybody.
Well, Prince.
I have nothing to add to the glory
of Versailles, your Majesty.
But that's not true.
You have something
rarer than diamonds.
You have your Master of Pleasures.
Vatel is worthy of a larger stage,
and Versailles could use
a man of his gifts.
You're asking me to stake
my Master Steward on a card game?
Do you have any objections?
Look what you might win.
We'll take the bet!
Are we playing or not?
Very well.
Then we're playing.
Your Majesty,
the envoys from Holland have arrived.
Then they come
at an interesting moment.
This is true.
Well.
It's between you two.
Prince?
Black queen.
Bad luck.
The envoys...
The Queen wants garlic.
- Garlic?
- She said she likes it.
Well, run to the kitchen...
Garlic!
If his Majesty comes out smiling,
it will be peace with Holland.
No, if he returns smiling,
it will be war.
War!
What do you think, Monsieur?
Certainly one or the other.
Also if he returns frowning.
Your wife is looking so beautiful
tonight, Longueville...
But where is she?
Your majesty?
Condé.
What's your opinion of war?
I have seen too much destruction,
Majesty.
William of Orange
has declined the offer
of the daughter
of the Duchesse de La Valliere.
Gallantly telling us
that his family only marry
the legitimate daughters of Kings,
not their bastards.
I see.
Furthermore, the ruler
of the flat earth
has minted coins
with the image of the Sun.
That is impertinent.
He has commissioned
an oil painting
of one of my flagships sinking.
With your permission,
I will drown him in one of his dykes.
You do not have the command yet,
Prince.
- It is between you and Turenne.
- Turenne?
I'm sure all will be alright.
After all, you have the King
under your roof.
Tomorrow will be decisive.
No, no, just leave me this one.
The Prince is grateful.
He would like to see you.
Her Majesty?
Asleep, Madame.
They were brought back,
orders of M. Vatel.
Would you like me
to undress you, Madame?
Fortune seems to be with us.
War with Holland.
Turenne is scheming
to get Colbert's backing.
The King favors me, I think.
He will make an announcement
at the banquet tomorrow.
Everything must be perfect.
Everything will be perfect,
my Prince.
We've always understood each other.
You're a great man, Vatel.
You will end up as a Vicomte.
- You have heard?
- Heard?
The King wants you
at Versailles.
Gently, gently-
The King wishes to honor you.
I'm sorry.
Gently now... Breathe in.
We have a present for you.
From the Marquis de Lauzun.
This will teach you
to step above your station.
What do you want?
Surprise!
Preparation!
Excellent. Lesson continues.
Ready?
Edouard, calf!
Louis, back!
Charles, wrist!
Bravo!
And now... open...
Th rust!
Thigh!
Tell Lauzun, enough.
His Highness the King's brother
presents his compliments.
He requests us to escort you
to your apartments.
It won't be necessary.
Madame.
I wanted to thank you.
If the King knew you were here.
The King is busy
with Mme de Montespan.
No one has seen me.
So you are coming to Versailles,
Monsieur.
Or haven't you heard?
One of my people was killed today.
Who was it?
His name was...
Jean-Marie Benoud.
28 years old,
from the village of St. Crose.
His father is the miller there.
His mother died of the sweating
sickness two years ago.
He had two brothers, one a priest.
He came here as a stable boy
and was senior groom for three years.
Three years...
You knew him well.
Not particularly.
He was one of my people.
He was fortunate in that.
Why did you save my birds, Monsieur?
Because they were too small
to do any good, Madame.
And because...
Because they were yours.
Anne!
- His Majesty...
- Go!
I'm ruined.
It's the King.
I'm a fool.
Yesterday you were a fool.
Stay here.
If you think I can do that,
you have lived among farmers
too long.
Condé gave you away
at the card table.
To please the King, he gave you away
like a hound from his kennels.
The King has retired.
Alone.
- We searched high and low.
- I was...
I know where you were.
But I would never betray you.
I told the King you were probably
consoling a dear friend,
the Duc de Longueville.
I mean, the way his wife
puts herself about is disgraceful,
don't you think?
You are a true friend.
Excuse me!
Well, you will need a friend now,
won't you?
Would you do me the honor
of sharing a cup of chocolate
with me
even at this late hour?
I think you'll find the King
a less democratic man than myself.
And it would be tragic, would it not,
if Vatel were to be sent back
to his former master
in the prison of Pignerol?
<i>The last day, dawn.</i>
My lord! Is there any news?
News?
Our money!
The money from the King!
Money?
Yes, the news is very good.
The King is well pleased with us.
God please! Where is Vatel?
I'm looking for him myself.
- Is everything alright?
- Yes indeed.
There will be turbot, sole,
pike, halibut, mullet.
Presented in heaps,
as beautiful as an engraving.
Trout and salmon
will seem to be swimming in broth...
On his Majesty's table
will be a sea monster,
a great cod,
baked whole, glazed, decorated,
holding a mackerel in its mouth.
The ice feast will be like
nothing seen before.
Is that all?
Have you seen other fish carts
on the road?
No, sir. There were storms
all along the coast.
Few boats put to sea at all,
and they came back empty.
Empty!
- Come back tomorrow to be paid.
- Thank you, M. Vatel.
M. Vatel! May I have a word?
Not now, Thibault, not now...
From his Majesty.
It's your commission for Versailles.
The King commands that you leave
with the Court tomorrow.
There will be a wagon
for your personal baggage.
You'll have a horse.
We await your answer.
Are you there?
It's your turn.
Poor little things.
My prisoners.
What is it?
This is for you.
<i>Madame,</i>
<i>when you read this,</i>
<i>I shall have left this world
with only one regret,</i>
<i>that I cannot be with you.</i>
<i>Madame, they will tell you
it was the failure of the feast...</i>
<i>But between the opening</i>
<i>and the closing of your heart,
I saw</i>
<i>that I was not the master
of these festivities,</i>
<i>but their slave.</i>
<i>May you escape by a better road.</i>
<i>Your home is, I think, in the south.</i>
<i>If so, remember that there is a place</i>
<i>not far away in the Vaucluse,</i>
<i>where they plant peach trees
among the vines.</i>
<i>The taste of the peaches</i>
<i>comes through in the wine.</i>
<i>Your servant, François Vatel.</i>
<i>Gourville, however, tried to make up
for the loss of Vatel.</i>
<i>It was done.</i>
<i>The meal was excellent.</i>
<i>People walked
and others were hunting.</i>
<i>The scent of daffodils
was everywhere, a true enchantment.</i>
