The first Colt repeating
pistols in this territory, sheriff.
Finest guns ever made.
Here's law and order
in six-finger doses, yes, sir.
Easy to load and as durable
as your mother-in-law.
Listen to that salesman later.
Let me out of here.
When the stage is ready to roll,
I'll see that you're on it.
Now, shut up.
I heard a lot about these new
Colt repeating pistols,
Mr. Farrell.
You'll hear more.
Nothing like 'em.
How much more
does a man have to hear?
Look what it says
in this advertising
your company's doing.
"The Secretary of War
and the President Polk
has contracted with Mr. Colt
for 2000 of his pistols."
During the war with Mexico,
these pistols were responsible
for our victories,
even though we were outnumbered.
"The remarkable advantage
of the Colt repeating pistol
"is dramatically proved
in the personal experience
"of Captain Steve Farrell,
"sent to Texas
with a cavalry detachment
"to rescue Colonel Cross
of the American Army.
"Ambushed by the Mexicans,
the entire detachment
"was killed or captured
and only Captain Farrell escaped
"by shooting his way to freedom
with a pair of the new
Colt repeating pistols."
"Farrell."
Captain Farrell, is that you?
Mr. Colt presented me
with this pair
when he was in Washington
trying to interest
the government in his revolver.
When my outfit was wiped out
in that ambush,
it was these guns
that saved my life.
Wish I could deliver them
instead of just take orders,
but factory's nearly
a year behind.
No chance of, uh, getting
a pair soon, Mr. Farrell?
No, not this far west yet.
Government orders
have to come first.
Powder's automatically measured
as you pour from the flask.
Six shots instead of one.
Man, that makes a difference.
In your business it does.
And I'm not covering
the general trade
until every law officer
in my territory gets
his order in first.
Just crimp in the bullets,
no wadding is necessary,
and the rammer tempts them home.
Six shots instead of one.
Farrell,
you really got somethin'.
If I had me one
of them revolvers,
I wouldn't be here now.
Push the cap down tight
and she's ready to go.
All your customers
as noisy as that?
Only one way to handle
these trouble-huntin' drifters:
Pick 'em up,
keep 'em on ice overnight
and then ship 'em out of town.
Keeps the streets clean.
Every man to his business,
sheriff.
Now to get back to mine.
Ordered in pairs,
this is the way Colonel Colt
ships this model. Complete.
Stage is ready to roll.
Got your package of freight
wrapped for shipment?
Be right out with him.
Mind waiting a minute,
Mr. Farrell?
I wanna hear more
about those guns.
This little job won't take long.
Maybe this time it won't.
I'll be back.
Mister, you ain't coming back.
Maybe I'm an old man,
but I know your kind:
Rotten clean through,
yellow as a whining pup.
The kind that can't be a man
without a gun in his fist.
A pistol don't make a man.
It's the gent behind the gun
that counts!
Hold it.
Now, the old man just said
that it was the gent
behind the guns that count,
and I'm behind these.
Never let me catch you
when you aren't.
Ah, that's better.
Gonna keep you on your feet.
I got use for you.
Hey, what's going on in...?
Thanks, Farrell.
Thought you'd forgotten
your promise, wouldn't show up.
Let that one move.
Get his partner here.
Partner?
Yes, partner. You heard
that killer call him by name.
A slick way
of getting guns in here
without the sheriff's suspicion.
Now, wait a minute...
Put him in there
and lock him up.
He stole those guns.
Oh, yeah, that's your story.
He stole those guns, I tell ya.
All right, Farrell.
On your way.
Your gear's in that closet
there. Get it out.
Decided you mighta
made a mistake
about that killer and me?
Not on your life.
The town put this badge on me
because I promised
to let you rot in jail.
I still wish that I could.
Why turn me loose then?
The circuit judge
hit town this morning.
Said I never had enough on you
to hold you, according to law.
Ordered me to release you.
So come on, get a move on.
I ain't got all day.
If it takes a stubborn man
to make a good sheriff,
you oughta be the best
in the country.
And don't figure on doing much
with them fancy pistols.
Because I got the country
well-plastered
with information posters on you.
You're not only stubborn,
mister, you are thorough.
Did you put out posters on
the thief that took my guns too?
I'll make a deal.
I'll give you a letter
clearing you
if you tell me where
that killer's hiding.
Why?
Because it's worth $5000.
Hasn't wasted much time
with my guns, has he?
I don't know where he is.
But you'll know when I find him.
I aim to get my guns back.
A pair of guns
ain't worth a long hunt.
Pair he has are.
They weren't made for the use
he's putting them to.
Blamed if I don't
half believe you.
Hm. Too bad you couldn't have
felt that way four months ago.
I'll walk down the stable
with you.
Might make a difference
with the price you get charged
for your horse's keep.
You know, if I thought
you'd really been telling
the straight story
from the beginning, Farrell...
You'd wish me luck?
Thanks, sheriff.
Whoa.
You hear some shootin'?
No.
I'm jumpy, I guess.
You sure we're carrying gold?
If we are, we'll find out.
That jasper with a .45 hasn't
missed a shipment in weeks.
Hyah!
That's a great-looking
bunch of Indians.
Did you get the real ones
planted?
Right where the sheriff
won't have to look for 'em.
You sure think of everything,
don't you, Brett?
Well, it's getting
pretty close to time.
The rest of you men ready?
Yeah.
All right, now remember:
Don't break cover
until you see that scarf
flying from the stagecoach.
It'll be different, not having
you and your guns with us.
You'll get used to it.
Fella's gotta move up.
Chief, you almost lost top-hair.
Here comes help.
We can't do anything for others.
But we'll get you a ride
into next town.
No.
White men look like Indian.
Kill my people.
Blame my people for holdup.
Holdup, huh?
Cut you down for bait, huh?
Boss has gun
which talk many times.
Like you.
Chief, take my horse.
Get back to your people.
On the move.
Hurry, chief!
Holdup ahead.
I'll give you a hand.
Smash through and don't stop.
Hyah! Hitch up!
Understand? Don't stop.
Get up there!
Hyah!
Don't be alarmed, ma'am.
A little trouble ahead.
Trouble?
It'll be all right.
Just keep your head down.
No, you can't.
Don't worry. Leave this to me.
Here she comes.
I hope the boys don't forget
my wife's on board.
They won't.
Yeah, that stage
is carrying gold, all right.
Aren't you ever jumpy, Brett?
Look, hadn't you better
clear out?
It wouldn't do for your wife
to see you here with me,
would it?
No. Come on.
You can't, I tell you.
You mustn't.
You want this stage stopped?
No, but...
Just keep out of my way.
You don't know
what you're doing.
Lady, I don't know
what you're doing.
No, you musn't. You can't.
I can try. I've come
a long way for the chance.
Out of powder.
Let 'em go.
Whoa.
Hiyo!
Hyah!
Hoo-doo.
You're in with this bunch.
Oh, no, I'm not.
You don't understand.
Maybe the sheriff will.
That driver's badly hurt,
we gotta get him back to town.
Give me a hand.
Hey!
How'd it go?
It went great.
Right according to plan.
What was the take?
I don't know yet.
Boys are bringing it in.
What's the matter, you nervous?
About you?
While you're carrying those?
Oh, no.
No, it's just...
Just what? Come on, spit it out.
I'd hate to think
that you or your wife
was holding anything out on me.
Not me.
Haven't I been working
along with you
ever since you took this place
of mine over for a hangout,
even against my wife?
No, it's... It's just that...
Well, you been taking too many
risks that you don't need to.
And missing
the really big thing.
Go ahead.
Well, you're like a miner.
Like me before I figured it out.
Because there's a mining boom
going on
you figure the only profit's
in gold.
I figure there should have been
about $10,000 in gold
on that stage today.
Nickels and dimes.
Where was it going?
Outside to buy more equipment.
To open more mines. To raise
more buildings in Bonanza Creek.
The town.
That's where the big take is.
How many miners leave
a boomtown richer
than when they showed up?
Not one in a thousand.
Where does the gold they dug go?
Hm-mm, the gambling halls,
the saloons, the banks.
You think I'd have got
this place for the price I did
if the first owner
hadn't gambled
and lost the whole works
to the bank?
You got a gambling hall
and a saloon and a bank
you wanna turn over to me?
The town's full of 'em.
And for the takin'.
Let Beth and me do more
than just
spot stage shipments for you.
We know the town.
We lay the groundwork.
You can move in behind us.
You got a little capital.
And when money won't talk,
those will.
You know, your wife
ain't been exactly anxious
to help us so far.
If she ever got on to you...
If she ever found out
you was one of us...
I'll take care of her.
This is a chance
to shave every day.
To sleep between clean sheets.
To have men tip their hats
to you and ask you for advice.
My hands in their pockets
at the same time, huh?
Now you're gettin' the idea.
Well, let's ask Beth.
Here she comes now.
Oh, she better not see me
talking to you like this.
Then you better get in there
and get in there fast.
All right, talk.
What about that man
on the stage?
What about those .45's
he was carrying?
Talk to me.
I never saw him before.
He... He just appeared.
Right out of thin air.
Yes, he was on the stage
before I knew anything about it.
There was nothing I could do.
You have to believe me.
You've got to.
Where's my husband?
What have you done to him?
Nothing yet. I wanted
to hear your story first.
Must you hold us responsible
for everything?
What do you expect of us?
I'm not sure about your husband,
but I can tell you
all about you.
Then you do believe
we had nothing to do
with what happened on the stage?
Sure.
You're too smart to lie to me.
Your husband is in there.
Oh, you handled that
beautifully.
Did I, Paul?
I'm sorry.
Sorry?
What's the matter with you?
What happened
on that stage today?
Beth, did you...?
Go to somebody for help?
No, we're cowards, both of us.
Because we value our lives?
What happened on that stage?
A man I'd never seen before
turned Brett's gang back.
I escaped
when he stopped the stage.
Oh, Paul, we can't
go on like this,
as members of the gang,
as if we had joined willingly.
There must be someone
we can turn to for help.
The judge, the sheriff,
somebody in town.
We've talked about this before.
It's too risky.
Maybe Brett wouldn't
harm you, I don't know.
But he'd kill me.
If he thought for a minute
that you had anything to do
with that trouble on the stage,
he'd of shot me,
right though that door,
with you standing here.
That what you want, Beth?
Oh, no, Paul, of course not.
I don't want the other things
he's promised.
I don't want good living,
travel and money.
I want what we had here
before we ever saw him.
They're our lives.
We've a right to live them.
And I wanna keep on living mine.
Be patient
a little longer, dear.
His kind never stays long
in one place.
I know it isn't easy,
but we've just got to wait.
He's an animal.
You should have seen him
behind those guns today.
I think he kills
just to see men die.
I know what's best for us,
believe me.
Trust me, sweetheart.
Oh, Paul.
It's been a hard day for you.
Let's get out of here.
Maybe after you've rested
awhile you'll feel better, huh?
Something's wrong.
Keep.
- What's the matter?
- Something's wrong.
Here, give me a hand.
What happened?
Careful, he's in pretty
bad shape.
All right.
At least the stage
came back this time.
What about the express box?
It's up there.
Those blasted Indians
in the hills?
Any of you know an Indian
whose got a pair of Colt. 45's
and knows how to use 'em?
Where's your sheriff?
Right here.
What's this about
a pair of .45's?
You oughta know, sheriff.
You got reward posters out
on the gang that did this.
Harris, how long are we gonna
put up with that bunch?
Just as long as I have
to put up with a town
that hides behind
its own street.
I've kept that bunch
out of Bonanza Creek,
and I'm not going into the hills
to look for them until you,
all of ya,
get off your bellies.
You get me a posse to back me up
and I'll bring the gang in.
Well, uh, I haven't lost
anything in the hills.
One bullet will kill a man
dead enough.
I ain't taking chances with six.
Grow big men in this country,
don't you, sheriff?
Hmph.
Pockets are so full of profit,
they can't get up
on their hind legs.
What's your name, mister?
Farrell. Steve Farrell.
All right, boys.
Roll the stage
down to the corral
and see that box
gets back to the office.
You look like one man
who could talk to the boss
of the .45's gang on even terms.
Will you step inside?
Sit down.
Thanks.
Now, why are you here
and what did you say
your business was, Farrell?
I didn't say.
I'm looking for a man,
the same man you are.
Why?
He stole a pair of guns from me.
Well, I suppose one reason's
as good as another.
Do you think you'll find him?
I know I will.
You help me and I'll help you.
You need a deputy.
Oh.
You mean you want one of these?
Sure.
I want the law behind me
when I go after those guns.
Well, pin it on, mister,
and welcome.
Looks like I'm gonna have
my first night off in months.
Ha-ha! Do you mind?
No.
Any passengers on that stage
when it left today?
I don't know,
I didn't see it leave.
Why?
Oh, nothing.
Go ahead, sheriff,
I'll hold the fort down.
Got some thinking to do.
Well, I'll see ya later.
Maybe a little
investigating too.
Mm.
What's the matter?
Who is he? Where'd he come from?
Who?
That man on the stage.
What's the difference?
We've been shot at before.
Yeah, but not
with a pair of those.
I don't like it!
Now we'll find out.
Who crossed us
up on the stage today?
Shut up. The boss wasn't...
What happened?
Your past almost
caught up with you.
Don't be funny.
Well, you're in a jam.
You wanna hear about it,
or don't you?
He's gettin' a little big
for his britches.
I'm listenin'.
You know who that was
on the stage today?
No.
Steve Farrell.
Farrell? A gun salesman.
He says you owe him
for those, uh...
Those guns and he brought along
a pair to collect with.
He ain't gonna get
a chance to use 'em.
Where is he now?
Oh, that'll keep.
We're making a deal first.
I saw Harris come in...
You stay out of this.
Sit down and shut up.
I better like this deal
of yours.
You'll have to.
I've got Farrell
in my hip pocket,
and he might get loose.
When I let you
start workin' my county,
there was one thing
we never settled.
Like what?
I'm givin' the orders
and you're taking them.
You're a big man,
ain't ya, sheriff?
Tough too, and smart.
What are ya without these?
Yella.
Why should you get all the gravy
and leave me to wash up
the plates behind you?
Now, listen...
You listen!
It's the last thing
you're gonna hear.
Now, pick him up
and put him in a chair.
You think fast.
The smart sheriff
wantin' to be the big boss.
You oughta listen.
Now, where's Farrell?
He's in my office,
wearin' a deputy's star.
So that's what
you thought was smart.
You were gonna send him
out here after me
with the law behind him.
Not really.
Sure, you go ahead.
You do that.
Only he'll never get here
because we'll meet him
on the way.
He's sharp.
He may not do it.
He's your deputy.
Make him do it.
All right.
Oh, sheriff.
Now, pick him up.
Send him back to town,
then get in here.
Looks like we're gonna get
ourselves another pair of .45's.
So that's where he is...
in town...
hidin' behind a badge.
Well, chief,
a friendly visit, I hope.
Me Walking Bear.
You my friend.
Save my life.
Bring back your horse.
Head all right?
No hurt bad.
How'd you know where to find me?
Indian have many way find out.
Why the paint?
White man kill
three Indian today.
Tomorrow...
three white men die.
You can't do that.
You can't go around taki"
the law in your hands
and killing people
just to get even.
Mm-mm.
White man law.
No good for Indian.
It is while I'm behind it.
Look, chief, if you kill
three people out of revenge,
that won't do any good.
There's only one man responsible
and he's my enemy too.
Leave him to me and the law.
Owe friend much.
We wait.
Watch you.
Three sunset.
Thanks, chief.
Thought you were gonna
take the night off.
Ah, I couldn't enjoy myself.
I had that .45's gang
on my mind, I guess.
So have I.
Look, sheriff, you know
anybody named, uh, Donovan?
Yes, a young couple. They own
a mine above Hog Meadow.
They're pretty well
thought of up here. Why?
I did a little investigating,
like I said.
Mrs. Donovan was a passenger
on the stage today.
No! You saw her?
Yes, and her signal
to the bunch that jumped us.
Mrs. Donovan? Are you sure?
She did her best to keep me
from standing them off.
Then ducked out
while I was helping the driver.
Oh, I don't believe it,
not that girl.
You weren't on the stage.
Where is this Donovan place?
What'll you do?
Well, it doesn't seem possible,
but if you saw
Mrs. Donovan, uh...
You know, we gotta be careful
how we do this.
We've gotta be careful
about everything
with this bunch, sheriff.
A circle around
the Donovan place, undercover,
oughta tell us something.
Well, anybody who saw me'd
recognize me sure.
I-I don't think I ought to go.
Suits me. Just, uh...
Just tell me how to get there.
Sure. First thing
in the morning.
All right, an extra share
on our next split
for the man who nails him.
Come on.
Scatter!
The man we want
was heading that bunch.
You our friend.
In plenty trouble.
Need our help.
I guess I did at that.
Thanks, chief.
I won't get anything from him.
Him no good for talk all right.
Too many trails.
All get away.
But maybe not so bad.
Walking Bear make you present.
That's a present I can use.
All right, boys, start talking.
Indian has ways
make prisoners talk.
I'll make 'em talk
when I get 'em back to town.
Mornin', Judge Tucker.
Good morning, Donovan.
How's the missis?
Oh, fine, thanks. Good.
What are you doing here?
I started Farrell on his way.
Yeah, I know.
I saw him start out.
But, uh, Brett figured
I'd better keep an eye on you
today just the same.
Now, you listen here.
Farrell!
And some of the .45's.
I know this one.
He shot Ben Murphy off a stage
I was ridin' last month.
This skunk held up Tom Feeney
and me out at our claim.
Well, thanks to Farrell,
we're getting some action.
The stagecoach yesterday
and now this.
It's time we took a hand,
someone get a rope.
Oh, hold on!
You elected me the law.
We're stickin' to due process.
Nobody's gonna get hung here
without a fair trial.
The sheriff's right.
If you think
they deserve a hanging,
appoint a miner's court
and do it properly.
You're makin' us waste
a lot of good time, Farrell.
All right,
we'll elect a court then.
Here's Judge Tucker.
The sheriff said this has got
to be according to law.
We'll need your help, judge.
A duty and a pleasure,
gentlemen.
We'll have court set up
and a jury paneled in no time.
All right, inside.
Pull this way, men.
What happened,
how'd you get 'em?
I was ambushed.
They'll tell us about it.
You'll get nothin' outta us.
Suit yourselves, boys.
If you decide to talk before
that court's set up out there,
we'll do what we can for you.
And if you don't,
well, they're your necks.
Get in there.
Make yourself comfortable,
sheriff.
We've got more time
than they have.
Farrell's in town.
I know that, with a couple of
the boys on the end of a rope.
They're gonna hang.
What am I supposed to do? Cry?
Don't you see it?
Now's the time to move.
You're crazy.
Am I? Ask Brett.
So the town's all fired up
about hangin' a couple
of the .45's gang.
Wonder what they'd do
if we threw the boss
right in their laps.
Now it's you that's crazy.
We gotta figure this out
very carefully, now.
Time is short. I got it figured.
Carl, Miller, get the rest
of the boys.
Now what? Don't make sense.
Well, we're on our way.
I figure...
I said I had it figured.
All right.
All right, then, but don't
forget this is my idea.
I ain't forgettin' anything,
includin' your wife.
How you gonna explain
this move to town to her?
She's kinda stubborn.
Not that stubborn. No woman is.
This means luxuries,
good livin'.
You can buy
the best woman with gold,
she won't care
where it comes from.
Beth will string along.
Not so easy
and not outside the law.
She'll give ya trouble.
I won't let her.
She'll have to understand
it's our big chance.
I'll make her see it.
That won't be necessary, Paul.
I understand completely now.
The things I've gone through
to buy my husband's safety.
Do you know why I ran over here
when I saw you ride in?
I was afraid. Afraid something
would happen to you.
Beth, listen,
it's not what you think.
It never has been,
even from the beginning, has it?
The man I thought I married
never really existed.
You know I love ya.
You think I wanna keep ya
in this dirty mine.
The dirt didn't come
out of the mine, Paul.
Beth...
This is a way
to everything we've wanted.
It affects our whole life,
our future.
Not mine. That's over with.
Finished!
I'll take care of her.
Better make it fast.
Beth, be sensible.
If you can't understand
my thinkin',
at least respect my judgment.
Respect!
You think I'll let
your stubbornness
stand in my way now?
Everything I've planned for?
Move.
Hey! Bring those horses up here.
You like honest minin' so well,
you oughta be happy in here.
Paul. Paul?
It's terribly dark in here.
Don't leave me
without a light, please.
There's candles
in there someplace.
Beth.
I'll be back sometime tomorrow.
I know how you feel
right now, but...
Well, do some thinkin'
till I get back.
Think real hard.
Maybe you'll change your mind.
Whatever I'm doin' is not only
for me but for you too.
Don't forget that.
You're not gonna
get those boys to talk.
A rope's pretty persuasive.
How's it comin' out there?
Just about set.
Nervous?
I'm not going to hang.
Why should I be nervous?
All right. Come on, judge.
Let's get the trial started.
We ready?
I now declare this court
in session.
Bring in the prisoners.
Right, judge.
No rope stretched yet.
Well, the law works kinda slow.
Gimme your guns.
Donovan, stay here as lookout.
Get a couple for yourself
from the boys.
Ready? We know the charges,
who can identify these men?
I can.
They were part of
the .45's bunch that held...
Anyone else
wanna perjure himself?
It's a break!
Get those cuffs of 'em.
Hold it.
There's some of your .45's
and the headman himself,
look at his guns.
Why he's the...
Don't open your mouth.
Here they are.
Look at 'em.
You've all been cryin'
for law and order,
well, now you're gonna get it.
Thanks to the help I got from
Mr. Brett in settin' my trap.
Trap? You could've
let us in on it.
Wait a minute.
I won't buy that
on a stranger's say so.
Or yours either, sheriff.
Don't worry about him,
he was the only man
with sand enough to help me.
What about those two
we were just...?
Two man outta his gang
ain't too big a price to pay
for the safety of the badge
he's wearin'.
Come on, let's get on with this.
All you need's
another length of rope.
Order.
Let's have some order.
You'll have your say
directly, Farrell.
We're handlin' this legal.
Quiet, now!
What do you think you're doin'?
Outta my way! Stay out of this.
I'm gonna tell
the whole town the truth.
Don't be a fool. Get!
Farrell's getting away!
Hold your fire!
That's Mrs. Donovan.
All right. Now, is that enough
proof for you ironheads?
What kind of a town
is this anyway?
The richest gold camp
in the country
crawlin' in its own gutters.
While an outlaw and a murderer
makes fools out of all of ya.
He's right.
I've had enough of this.
We've gotta stop that killer.
Even the town ain't safe now.
How about Mrs. Donovan?
I'll fill a saddle.
I'm with ya.
Well, sheriff, it looks like
you got your posse.
All right, men, get your horses.
But we've got
some unfinished business.
It'll keep. You're jail
will take care of these two.
Get their boss.
They'll likely head straight
for the Indian camp.
All right, men.
What a great plan, Brett.
Bring the boys.
Sorry, I gotta keep you boys
locked up till tonight,
make things look good.
Where are the keys?
In the door there.
These are Miller's.
I had to shoot her, I had to.
She was gonna tell
the whole town.
What are ya worryin' about?
Everything went fine.
Went just like clockwork.
Yeah, the rest'll be easy.
How is she?
Not bad hurt.
White men do that?
White men crazy.
What...?
What am I doing here?
I brought you.
Why?
You're my guarantee
I'll get to the man I want.
I gotta get to Judge Tucker,
to the sheriff,
I've gotta warn them all.
I've gotta warn them.
They're in danger,
terrible danger, all of them.
Brett and my husband
plan to take over the town.
You thought a little differently
about Mr. Brett on that stage.
I hated him from the first
minute I saw him.
I thought my husband's life
was in danger.
I didn't know
that he was one of the gang
and just as rotten
as any one of them.
You could help me.
You've got to.
These Indians
must be your friends,
they can help too.
Not in the mood they're in.
Besides, Brett's my job.
Your job?
Who are you?
Steve Farrell.
In a way I'm responsible for
every move Brett's been making.
Violence and death with a pair
of guns he stole from me.
I've got to tear down everything
he's built with those guns.
He should be killed.
Killing Brett isn't enough.
Walking Bear can do that much
with an arrow on a dark night.
I'm not a policeman,
that's for other men.
My job is to get back
those .45's
and wipe out everything Brett's
made those guns stand for.
If we could get to Judge Tucker,
to the men in town...
Why, they think I'm the head
of the .45's gang.
Brett sold 'em that
this afternoon.
Then help me get outta here,
I can prove to them
they're wrong.
Somebody in town
doesn't like you.
Show up again
and they may not miss.
My husband's
a very bad shot, Mr. Farrell.
Your husband shot you.
Men from town come.
Many guns.
You stay here.
Be quiet.
Hey, in the camp there.
Where's your chief?
We want to talk to him.
Sheriff Harris,
I've got to see him.
Stay.
Harris will do you no good.
He's tied in with Brett too.
What?
Then the posse, I can tell them.
Harris will find an excuse
to kill you
the moment you start to talk.
Come on. Sit down.
We want Farrell. Where is he?
And the girl.
Yeah, the killer you
helped escape from town.
The woman. We want them,
we're taking 'em back.
Do you understand?
He's stalling, sheriff, he knows
what you're talking about.
Yeah, bring Farrell
and the woman out here.
You're dealing with the law.
Only friend welcome here.
Law no friend to Indian.
Go!
Look at those guards, Harris.
Farrell's in there.
Let's grab him. You crazy?
That's your final word, chief?
Listen, Farrell,
this doesn't get you anyplace
and these Indians either.
You better come on out,
or I'll send a rider
to Fort Taylor for the cavalry
and they'll level this camp.
Do you want that?
I can't let him do that. No.
Walking Bear won't let them
take you.
There'll be a fight,
and that's what you don't want.
Let's get out of here.
All right, boys, turn in.
Get some rest.
There'll be plenty to do
tomorrow.
You knew those Indians
wouldn't let us near Farrell
or that girl.
Sure.
What good is it gonna do 'em
to stay in the Indian camp?
They've gotta come back here
if they're gonna tell anybody
their story.
When they do,
we'll be waitin' for 'em.
Come on, I'll show you
the real reason
I wanted to get
the posse out of town.
Now let's go in here to
the express office, sheriff.
Evening, sheriff.
What's one of your men doing
here? Where's old Tom Mason?
His record wasn't so good.
He lost too many gold shipments.
Sort of got relieved.
Yeah, the express company
is gonna be mighty grateful.
You see, the new manager pays me
a 10 percent insurance fee
on every shipment
and guarantees safe delivery.
Won't... Now... Now, look, Brett...
Come one, sheriff, you don't
know what you've been missing.
Well, how far do you think you
can go with this sort of thing?
I don't think I've heard what
the range of these .45's is.
Far enough to empty
a lot of pockets.
Well, it's gotta end someplace.
It will,
when I've got all I want.
What about the rest of us?
Listen, those that stick with me
are through with worry and sweat
for the rest of their lives.
Come on, I'll buy you
a drink on that.
I, uh... Heh-heh.
I think I need one.
It's on the house.
Good evening, boss.
Evening. Set 'em up, Jack.
Boss? But this is
Sam Clark's place.
It sort of changed hands.
Sam and I had
a little understanding.
Sam wouldn't sell this place
for all the gold in the hills.
Heh, no.
Sheriff, I don't buy nothin'.
Have a drink.
It was clean?
And quiet, huh?
He just sold out and left town
if anybody asks you.
Too far, Brett,
you're going too far.
Why don't you let me
be the judge of that.
Get the rest of the boys,
post 'em on outlook around town.
Farrell and Donovan's wife
are due to pay us...
My wife.
What wife? I got no wife.
I had to shoot her.
She'd have told the whole town.
See you later at the office.
Harris is scared stiff.
You don't need him anymore.
You don't need any of 'em
with me around.
Wasn't this my idea
from the beginning?
Why should you cut the rest?
Just you and me, huh?
Yeah, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.
Who do we drop first?
Let's get out of here.
All right, partner.
Ah, we're gonna live.
We're gonna live.
Tell the chief
I want to see him.
Now.
What are you planning to do?
When sun comes,
we ride on warpath.
But you promised me time
to do it my own way.
Promise no good.
You law then.
Now law after you.
Bad man
big chief in town.
But, chief, you've got...
Come.
Him on road near town.
Bullets all in back.
Killed by guns shoot many times.
Take woman inside.
Chief, if you break
the peace now,
you'll make enemies
of a lot of innocent people.
Dead enemy's best way to peace.
When sun comes, we attack.
I'm making a break for town.
I've got to warn them.
No, Steve. They'll shoot you
on sight if they see you.
Let me go.
No.
I wanted the law behind these.
I suppose I still do.
Where's that badge?
There it is.
Get her!
Here, Joe.
Farrell might be
right behind her.
Get your horse.
Hurry up. Get that rope across.
Get him up.
These didn't do him much good,
did they?
We had luck. Go ahead, move.
Move!
Have you seen white woman?
Look, chief,
you says you were my friend.
It's... It's one hour to dawn.
You've got to help me till then.
Till sunrise,
help friend.
Got to move fast and quiet.
Indian always quiet.
Let me go!
Let me go!
The boss will be glad
to see you.
There's a lady coming in.
Open up.
She come by the hill road.
Where's Harris?
He's watching the road with Joe.
Get out the back way
and watch that door.
You take the other entrance.
Miller, out front.
So you were gonna tell
all you know, huh?
And you know plenty. Too much.
You can't go on with this. No?
You've gotta listen to me.
I'd like to.
For days on end,
if you'd be reasonable.
You know, the biggest man
in town needs a woman.
Somebody who knows how to dress,
entertain and to make friends.
You'd have the biggest house,
all the clothes you want,
everything you want.
Keep away. Don't touch me.
I said, don't touch me!
I can wait.
Sit down.
A guard's posted.
Our man's in there.
Proud of them, aren't you?
Sure.
They're like a disease with you.
Something that eats from inside.
Where's Farrell?
All right, my boys will get him.
He's gotta come back here.
Can't do anything else.
I don't like it out there.
Why doesn't something happen?
Farrell wouldn't let her
come in here alone.
He was with her or followed.
She came by the hill road,
that's where Harris was.
Why don't somebody
do something...?
Pour yourself some backbone
and shut up.
But you know he's right.
Where is Steve Farrell?
You tell me.
What we got in this safe
would get us out of the country
and set us up somewhere else.
We're set up here.
Not me, I'm getting out.
I've had enough.
So have I.
Farrell...
Farrell's in town.
Well, you've heard from Harris.
We gotta get out of here.
Quit yelping.
Get in here.
Bar the door.
Give Miller a hand.
Drag that out of here.
Get the rest of the boys
together. Comb this town.
I want Farrell!
You want Steve Farrell?
He's here, and he wants you.
Think that'll keep him out?
There's another pair
of .45's out there now,
and a better man.
Shut up!
Psst.
Hey, Miller.
Farrell's in town.
Come on.
Hey, where's Evans?
Let's get out of here.
Farrell.
I'm all right.
I'll get that one.
Watch the back door
of the sheriff's office.
Brett may run.
Quiet, isn't it?
Where are your men?
Not a sound.
What's happening?
Evans, Ray, Billings.
Steve, look out!
Miller.
You'll never make it.
Let her go, Brett!
You haven't got a chance!
Steve. Steve.
All right? Mm.
Keep her here.
No, listen to me.
That's Farrell!
Yes, but Brett's
the man you want, not Steve.
Brett's the leader of the .45's.
Brett? Woman speak truth.
Well, don't just stand there.
Somebody do something.
Help him. No.
Him chief.
Him no want help.
Big chief always take own scalp.
We stay here.
No.
I'm unarmed.
I told you, never let me
catch you when you were.
I died a hundred times
while you were in there.
I nearly did,
once.
