OUR LADY OF THE ASSASSINS
Who is it?
Fernando.
You're back at Iast!
I'm back at Iast.
- How Iong has it been?
- About 30 years.
30 years! That Iong!
You really haven't changed.
I stiII recognize you.
I stiII recognize you, too.
Come in.
Let me introduce you.
This is "The Pest".
This is Fernando.
Here's the nicest present
you could get.
The most fabulous boy in Medellin.
Alexis.
This is my friend Fernando.
We've known each other...
Forever.
Ever since we became fags.
- Right?
- You're crazy!
I'm a fag?
You and the President are fags.
Someone who's slept with
over a 1000 boys isn't a fag.
He's a far out guy. Right?
Sure!
Sit together...
...and never part again.
Alexis...
A IoveIy name!
Who gave it to you?
My mom.
Where are you from, kid?
From here: Medallo.
Now it's called Medallo?
Or Metrallo.
Like in metralleta, machine gun?
I'm gIad the name's been changed.
Medellin was a tired old name.
It came from a pigsty
in Estremadura.
No one knows that anymore, or cares.
You know where Estremadura is?
In Spain.
You've been there?
I've been everywhere.
Like a witch doctor.
Really?
Why did you come back?
To die.
To die?
First show him the butterfly room.
Life is short and ends
when you Ieast expect it.
Where are the butterflies?
There are none.
We're the butterflies.
A name's a name,
the substance is what matters.
Take off your clothes, kid.
For protection.
- From what?
- Whatever.
And that?
I got a bIast from a shotgun.
So the amulets don't work!
No, they do.
Without them I'd have died.
You can't argue
with that kind of Iogic.
My heater.
It's aIso caIIed an iron.
Why do you have this heater or iron?
Some dudes who're in Iove with me
wanna waste me.
Kill me.
Wait, I don't foIIow you there.
If they're in Iove with you,
why kiII you?
They Iove me in a hatefuI way.
HatefuI Iove?
What Ianguage do you guys speak
in MedaIIo?
Martian?
Pick up your gun, kid.
If I do, I'II aim it at my heart
and puII the trigger.
I'd spIash bIood
aII over my friend's pIace.
And he's been so nice to me.
Be right back.
Who's that?
Vallejo, the writer.
And the IittIe angeI?
Alexis. He has 3 or 4 murders
on his conscience.
He was in a gang that got wiped out.
He's the only survivor.
Am I right, Pest?
Or were there more?
- Forget it.
- Who cares?
We're born to die.
I brought you a rum and coke.
So you can take your girlfriend out.
What girlfriend?
I don't like women.
Glad to hear it.
So many clocks, but what time is it?
Which one should I trust?
It's 10:15 PM.
So that's the time.
It's whatever you say it is.
What are you doing tomorrow?
What day's tomorrow?
Tuesday, as far as I know.
Tuesdays I go to a piIgrimage
at the church in Sabaneta.
Want to come with me?
Sabaneta!
That's close to Santa Anita,
our countryhouse was there...
I wish I couId see it again.
That one isn't as pretty
as our farm was.
Ours got torn down.
Everything has an end!
Please turn down the radio.
I can't stand that radio
bIaring in my ears!
- Stop, we're getting out.
- You gotta pay the whole trip!
We're not there yet.
I'II pay you
what's on the meter.
Here's the fare.
Faggots!
He's Iucky it's Our Lady's day,
or I 'd have offed him.
You said
you came back to die?
It's true.
I don't want to Iive anymore.
I've Iived more than enough.
This is borrowed time.
Look!
The Bombay cantina!
A miracle it's still there.
It's exactly the same.
Except for the gas pump
where we filled my grandpa's Hudson.
Let's go in.
There's nobody.
Anyone here?
I'm here.
That's great!
I'II have an aguardiente. Or two?
Two. Two guaros.
Come Iook at this.
"Senderito"!
I can't beIieve it.
How much do I have to put in?
1000 pesos.
Goddam inflation!
It's what our farm cost!
You're crying?
What happened?
Time caught up with me.
In this same bar, when I was a kid,
on a day Iike this,
I heard that record.
Then my parents,
my brothers and sisters,
and grandparents were alive.
They're all dead.
How can I not cry?
Let's pay the man and go.
Do they distribute free booze here?
Or did these unbelievers
get their faith back?
Hey, guys!
You guys OK?
Mary Help of Christians,
little virgin,
sweet child!
Dammit to hell!
Those pricks are fighting again.
Two gangs from Santo Domingo Savio.
Another saintly neighborhood!
These people became more civilized
in my absence.
At the end,
it's all the same, right?
Guys bite the dust.
You can't say "at the end".
One says
"in the end" or "in any event".
But say what you want,
speak your way.
At the end, it's all the same.
Why do those assholes
from a distant hilltop
come down here to raise hell?
It's about debts.
Those guys who got wasted
were Pablo's people.
Who's Pablo?
Pablo Escobar.
I don't know him.
Is he a soccer pIayer?
You don't know Pablo?
You're putting me on.
Those guys worked for him
as hit men.
He got knocked off.
Now everyone up in the hills
is out of work.
So he was
"a good provider for the people."
Poor Pablo.
They don't Iet anyone
get ahead here.
Stop that cab before it kills us.
To Medellin, please.
This is my place.
Make yourself at home.
- It's empty!
- Empty?
There's a bed in that room.
And a table and chairs,
or "stools" as they call them here.
Four stools.
There are two of us, so that's two extra.
Who needs more?
- And no music?
- Yes, the birds.
They sunbathe here.
Come and see, it's beautifuI.
Look!
There's Medellin for you!
Medallo!
You don't even have a hi-fi?
We'II go buy one right away.
You'II see
how hot this stereo sounds.
The seminary has become a mall!
Who'd have guessed!
How come you're Ioaded?
How much did your apartment cost?
Nothing. My sister Gloria
left it to me when she died.
- She was rich?
- Stinking rich!
She had millions.
She married a Mafioso.
Which one?
What does it matter? He's dead.
She offed him all by herself.
One night he was drunk,
she pushed him off the terrace.
Dropped him Iike soiIed underwear.
He crashed down on the sidewalk.
The autopsy stated:
"Accidental death". Died of drink.
And her millions?
Her two useless sons
snorted most of it.
I got what was Ieft.
Who knows who killed them!
You?
Me? Come on!
So you came back to Colombia
to inherit.
Did you Iove your sister?
Very much.
Now I have no one Ieft to Iove.
What else do you want?
A motorcycle?
- No, a mini-Uzi.
- What's that?
A small machine-gun.
I'm against aII vioIence.
Kid!
Turn the music down a bit?
You don't Iike it?
I'm not used to it yet.
I'm going to the drugstore
for aspirin.
See you Iater.
Get out of the car!
I'II remember you!
Come see the stiff!
That's 2 today!
We're breaking records!
You sell earplugs?
Turn it off!
Someone just got killed.
He wouldn't hand over his car keys!
What an idiot!
To get killed for a car...
That damn hippie!
He kept me awake again Iast night.
It's been going on for days.
I didn't hear anything.
Are your ears wrecked?
Let's see.
Can you hear me now?
Yes, I can.
I want a good Iook at his face.
What for?
There's nothing we can do.
Here everyone screws everyone,
no one respects anyone.
I'II cIose off the terraces
with doubIe windows.
In this heat? No!
Teach him some respect!
One of these nights,
I'II shoot the sonofabitch
from here.
Not from here. They'II know
where the buIIet came from.
Do it in the street.
I'II do it.
I said nothing.
Just forget about it.
Can I turn on the stereo?
The stereo?
Sure, kid.
You still have it on?
I can turn it down a bit.
No. I'II do it for once.
You broke an Aiwa!
Yes, I broke it.
Did I kiII anyone?
Are you crazy?
Breaking stuff worth a fortune!
Tell me something.
Do you also like women?
- Depends...
- Depends on what?
If they have IittIe brothers.
When they have cute IittIe brothers
I do. Otherwise, no.
You're the craziest guy I ever met.
Listening to Callas,
you'll discover good music.
You've heard nothing Iike it.
There's "The Pest"!
How's things?
This is my friend.
This is "The Pest".
"Mister Writer".
We met the other night.
This is Deadboy.
Deadboy.
Hey, what's the deaI?
Nothing.
We just bought a hifi and a TV.
We're due back.
They're delivering it.
See you around.
They're an item.
They're in Iove.
That's Callas?
Sounds Iike she's being strangIed!
That's the finest aria ever written.
Her incredible voice
is piercing my heart.
That's the northeastern hilltown,
where Santo Domingo Savio is.
That's where those two gangs
in the shootout are from?
This city's IoveIy when it's asIeep,
when its 4 miIIion souIs
stop robbing, mugging and killing.
What?
At night is when it gets good!
When it pops!
What's that for?
It's not a hoIiday.
Means they got a shipment of coke
into the U.S.
They're celebrating.
Listen...
Listen to him. It's the hippie!
He's at it again.
Let's go see.
There he is.
I got a good Iook at him.
He's a punk.
I'm going for a waIk.
Where to?
To a church. Anywhere.
Another church?
What for?
You went yesterday.
To Iisten to God's siIence.
A peso, for the Iove of God!
Ask Him for it, if he's so Ioving.
Or ask the guy
who knocked you up!
You old bastard!
This decision will benefit
all Colombians...
It's the President.
His decision will benefit
all Colombians.
Turn that faggot off!
It's more noise.
It's just Iies.
What are you doing?
I'm gonna kiII the fucker!
Bullseye! You showed him!
Let's waste this piece of shit, too.
Did I kiII anyone?
- Open your mouth!
- What for?
Two, please.
These people are so stingy.
They even slice up napkins.
A fly couldn't blow its nose in it.
Everyone's rotten,
the world's run by crooks.
Look at our despicable President.
"A decision that will benefit
all Colombians!"
If you want, I'II off him.
I mean it.
That's just a waste of bullets.
- You believe in God?
- No.
I toId that oId creep
to fuck off Iong ago!
Saint Ignatius.
The other is
Blessed de la Colombiere.
You know who that one is?
Saint Anthony,
the patron saint of Iovers.
Ours.
"I turned Saint Anthony upside down.
"He didn't find me a sweetheart,
he let me down..."
What do we do now?
I, not a thing.
What I had to do in Iife
I aIready did.
Like a gust of wind peeling lime
off the walls.
Why don't you read something
for a while?
Like Jules Verne's
"Two Year Vacation".
I know how to read.
But I can't concentrate.
Okay, then let's sit together.
We'II stare at that waII
and Iisten to the siIence.
If they'd Iet peopIe work here,
I'd heIp you start a business.
But they don't.
With all the red tape and taxes,
you go bankrupt.
The workers don't work either.
The boss does all the work.
Never give
your fellow man a job, kid.
Let his damn mother give him one!
What do we do now?
I don't know.
Go back out again.
Put two poor wretches together,
in 15 minutes they'II breed
10 more poor wretches.
I hate poverty.
The way to get rid of it,
is to get rid of those
who spread it.
Look! The punk!
They did it!
He's dead.
A ridiculous remark, lady!
Like something
out of a Mexican movie!
Who killed him?
Who? Those bikers!
Didn't you see them?
I fixed him!
He's a stiff, good for a box.
My God, what did you do?
He had it coming.
Killing that poor boy
for no reason!
- How could you?
- What poor boy?
A dickhead!
Serves the prick right.
You said you wanted to kill him!
I did,
but it was just a mean thought.
If we kiIIed everyone
we kiII in our heads
Iife wouId be butchery!
Can't you distinguish
between thought and action?
What separates the two
is called "civilization".
- Sure. Losing controI.
- No!
Double windows
would have gotten rid of the noise.
And the heat?
Alexis...
Kid...
Wake up!
What happened!
Who'd they kill?
Nobody, calm down.
I can't sIeep.
The silence keeps me awake...
That buzzing...
Listen!
Can you hear it?
I hear nothing.
Is it my conscience buzzing?
Or is it the crickets?
I feeI guiIty.
About what?
About the punk.
What punk?
Right, I forgot.
After 7 nights of silence,
I miss the drumming.
I miss it so badIy.
That fabulous noise.
It's over.
Everything in this world ends.
You shouldn't carry a gun.
What can you do with it,
except kill someone?
Let the Iiving Iive. They'II kiII
each other aII by themseIves.
You just sit and wait.
How ya doin' guys?
Know what? Hide your ass,
they're still after you.
- Where you going?
- To the cathedraI.
To get married?
Yeah, we're getting married. See ya.
What was that?
No, nothing.
Are those two Iovers?
No. Close friends.
Isn't that the same?
They don't have sex.
You can't Iive without sex.
People go crazy without sex.
Look how nutty the Pope's become.
Spouting crap everywhere
and kissing floors.
Saying that homosexuals,
and all that, is a sin.
That's a sin?
Having kids is a sin!
There's no space Ieft,
the pIanet'II expIode!
There's another case.
Known as "The Liberator"!
You big coward!
You faggot!
The only time
you had to fight, you fled!
And jumped off a balcony.
3 feet off the ground! This high!
SIMON BOLIVAR
Beat it, the pigeons will shit on you.
Hide under your wife's skirts!
Cocksucker!
Glory is a statue
that gets shit on by birds.
This place has become
a marijuana den.
Don't tell me that's incense!
And them?
They're whoring.
"Mr. Condom".
He goes round the whorehouses
selling condoms.
Let's split. They're from
the hilltowns. Working a scam.
Selling crack for sure.
- Where to?
- Wherever you feeI Iike taking us.
- Up there?
- Okay. Up.
This nice man's taking us
where he's headed.
Could you turn off the radio?
Turn it off?
For a Iousy fare?
This cab cost a fortune!
The Iousy fare feeds you!
Gonna eat your tires?
You don't Iike it, get out!
We will!
Why must I Iisten to music
I don't Iike?
That shit isn't music!
Say that again, you fucker?
You're so polite!
What did you say?
Nothing. It was just a comment.
I'II cut your head off
and stew it!
Take it easy. Don't get mad!
I'm getting mad, fuckhead?
Your fag's ass stinks
Iike your mom's cunt!
Let's get out of here.
This city is poisoned,
possessed by hate.
What bug bit it?
Or is it me?
No. That bastard deserved to die.
No dumping of corpses
It's forbidden
to dump corpses... but Iook!
How can you forbid anything
in this ungovernable country?
People come here to dump corpses
because it's forbidden!
That's where I grew up.
The hilltowns:
La Salle, El Popular,
La Francia,
Villa de Socorro,
Santo Domingo Savio.
Your neighborhood.
We'II go some day.
What for? It's reaI hot there.
Look!
The vultures are coming to get me.
Perfect!
That's how I want to wind up.
Like that corpse:
inside a IoveIy bird, fIying!
I won't Iet them put me
in a straight-jacket, in a coffin.
I'II Ieave this worId
as I Iived: free!
The subway.
What would my grandfather
have said about this?
"Why the hurry to end up
in a hole in the ground?"
Lady, move your kid!
His dirty shoes
are on a brand new seat!
It cost a fortune to buiId,
pIus the payoffs!
Leave the Iady aIone!
Look at that dirty cocksuckers!
Another crazy!
Who's a cocksucker?
You think you're cute?
He told you to shut up, dickhead!
Cocksucker!
You gents have a rich vocabulary!
Two expressions:
dickhead and cocksucker.
Know who you're talking to?
Colombia's last grammarian,
who discovered the pro-verb.
Know what that is?
A word that replaces a verb.
For instance:
"He said he'd kill him, and he did."
That "did" replacing "kill",
is a pro-verb form.
Two scumbags Iess,
and one buIIet Ieft.
I need more ammo.
AII these kiIIings
are encouraging
my own self-destructive urges.
Think twice before you shoot,
count to ten.
It's us or them.
Us and them.
I need enemies.
So they can watch me eat.
Straight ahead! Turn the radio off,
we're very upset!
"Thou shalt not kill".
Why? Taking someone's Iife
is doing them a favor.
A huge favor.
Let them Iive,
it's what they deserve.
Let them bear their cross.
Get us each a whole napkin
instead of these scraps!
This thing wouldn't cover
a whore's cunt!
When people sit on their asses
watching 22 childish adults
kicking a ball, we're screwed.
- And the napkins?
- We're all out!
Nice manners!
She's Iike an Air France stewardess!
Got a cork up her ass!
Old fart!
Not worth it, kid.
Let's eat.
Give it to him.
Tomorrow I have to get more ammo,
or they'II waste me.
Did you see that child's eyes?
Terrifying.
He Iooked at me
from the depths of heII...
From God's infamy!
At night those hills were black,
there wasn't one light.
And during the day cows mooed!
Medellin was a big farm
with a bishop.
To tell you the truth...
I prefer it now, fuII of peopIe.
Why get more bullets?
Chuck the gun.
They'II waste me.
I've been sentenced.
What do you mean?
Who sentenced you?
A judge? The Courts?
No. A gang from La Francia did.
Here anyone who wants to,
can sentence you?
Anyone who packs a piece.
Why were you sentenced?
They claim I owe them a tab.
A reaI viper's nest!
Can't we fix it with money?
By paying someone
to waste them!
Forget about that!
We'II get out of here.
Where to?
They got another shipment through.
Prices will collapse!
We scored!
Here you are.
Wow, great!
And don't ask me where I got them.
Where?
Where they have Iots.
The army barracks.
I went to see the commander,
whom I addressed as Sergeant, Sir.
They explained
I should address him as "My Major".
Why "my", if he isn't mine?
Now if he were just a buck private,
"My little buck private..."
But a major!
My tastes
don't even go up to sergeant!
You knew which bullets to get?
I took it with me.
It's a Beretta, right?
You're crazy!
You don't have a permit!
Colombia's foremost grammarian
doesn't need a permit.
The major understood that perfectly.
He wouldn't even let me pay
for the bullets.
You're too much.
You should've gotten a mini-Uzi.
The Salesian College,
my childhood prison.
I was baptized in that church.
Look who's here.
The Grim Reaper's messenger, Deathboy.
What brings you?
Today they're gonna waste you!
Who?
Two guys on a black Kawa.
The driver's wearing a white shirt,
the rider a green jacket.
See you.
Thanks!
Closed.
To protect their poor-box
and silverware.
And to stop people from sleeping
or smoking crack in there.
For some reason
I never went inside this church.
The house where I was born.
It's exactly the same.
I wonder who owns it now.
We had a pool,
a piano,
two yards and a lemon tree,
and a parrot called Faust.
Too bad. You'll never live
as happily as I did then.
Happiness can't exist in your world
of TV's, ghetto blasters,
punks and rockers.
We gave that parrot altar wine
to loosen its tongue,
then it'd recite the Scriptures.
"Get up, you little bastards!"
It'd say that to wake us up.
My life has slipped away...
Bastards!
They got blood on my house!
They wanted to take you
for a ride!
And on a Kawa!
You gonna buy me a pastry?
A whole box, if you want.
You a Mafioso, or what?
Go get 'em, man.
A box of glory cakes.
With guava filling.
I remember this street
as full of pretty faces.
Where did they go?
My taste got better
or the genes got worse.
Everything changes.
Even God. He's not the static force
theologists claim.
Dumb priests! Nothing stays still!
Even rocks move!
In every atom of every rock,
electrons spin around nuclei.
Matter and movement
are one and the same.
Matter doesn't need God to move.
But He needs us to exist.
Without our thoughts,
He doesn't exist.
I'm paying for a box of pastries.
I'm hungry.
Get in line, scumbags!
Line up.
On your knees! Or you get none!
Some for me, little father.
Here, grandma.
He's gone nuts.
Where are we going?
I don't know...
Wherever you say.
I didn't know
there were still places like this.
Know what they're playing?
"Francisco Alegre", a pasodoble.
You like it?
No, this music
reminds me of too much.
But now I like it. I'm with you.
It'll be our song.
I'll remember you when I hear it.
And I you.
Let's celebrate with a drink.
Welcome to "Patio del Tango".
Why a pasodoble?
For a change.
I knew a "Patio del Tango",
years ago in Guayaquil.
Same place.
I came here
when they pulled it down.
Then I know you.
You're Don Hannibal.
You won't remember me.
I was a boy, then.
What do you do now?
- I'm supposed to be a writer.
- What do you write?
Trash.
Don't believe him. He's a joker.
Nothing is written for all eternity.
All roads are open,
everything changes!
Don't delude yourselves
that things will stay as they are!
Everything you see today
will soon be gone without a trace!
Time will sweep it all away.
Dupes!
All this is unreal.
We're a flowing river,
a mirage of nothingness.
Scumbags, crackheads,
petty thieves!
Colombian people!
Thanks, my fellow countrymen!
Love yourselves
as I loved you, you fuckers!
For Thine is the kingdom of heaven!
"The Kingdom of Heaven"?
That's the name of the grocery store
under my house.
What's going on?
What have we come to?
All these absurd deaths.
It preys on my mind.
How many so far?
Don't count them.
Make a wish.
Done.
What?
For us to be together forever.
Last night I made the same wish:
us together, forever.
What now, freako?
They'll be back today.
How? They're already dead!
Or can the dead
come back to life now?
New guys.
Their blessed bullets can't miss.
They're on a red Yamaha 100.
The driver's wearing a red jacket.
Blessed bullets?
You put six bullets in a pan
on an electric hotplate
till they're red hot.
Then sprinkle them with holy water
from the Church of St Jude.
While it evaporates
you count to three
and pray as hard as you can.
"By the grace of St Jude,
"may these blessed bullets
hit their mark
"and may he die painlessly."
Is that them?
It's not a Yamaha.
The driver isn't wearing a red jacket.
Where will we go?
We'll see. The world's a big place.
The Fine Arts Building.
I studied piano there.
It's them!
Lady,
what did they do to you?
Nothing.
They killed him!
So what?
People get killed here all the time!
This isn't Switzerland!
It's Medellin, Colombia.
Don't you ever go out?
Yes, I do.
But he was an innocent person.
You sure?
No innocents here,
they're all guilty!
More so if they breed!
"An innocent!"
Calm down, lady!
It's just another corpse.
Not one, two.
Now I can't leave my house
any more,
or have more kids.
Alexis...
You're the best thing
life ever gave me.
What can it be?
Dunno.
It's coming from down there.
It's a dog.
Let's go look.
He can't get out.
Got hit by a car.
His legs are broken.
Who knows how long
he's been stuck in there?
Maybe several days.
No use getting him out
in that state.
He'll never walk again.
If we get him out
he'll only suffer more.
We have to kill him.
- How?
- Shoot him.
I can't.
I can.
God doesn't exist.
And if he does,
he's the worst scumbag.
I can't stand life anymore.
The stream got our gun.
Good!
Too bad it didn't get us, too.
I'd like to get out of here.
Where to?
New York.
No, it's full of Colombians.
Miami.
It's full of Cubans.
Then to France.
The French are a pain.
They fight with everyone.
And Spain?
The Spaniards smoke a lot and shout.
I can't stand them.
A desert island?
With you, yes. You're all I need.
Watch out! Fernando!
Kid!
Help me lift him,
so I can take him to a hospital.
Poor kid.
How many times was he hit?
Let's go! Hurry!
We'll go to that hospital over there.
What's it called?
- I saw the guy!
- A fuckin' hitman!
He'll get blood on my carpet.
I'll pay for the cleaning.
Over here!
How dare you dump a corpse
at a hospital!
Nobody comes up here!
Not even in an armored car!
Even the cops get mugged.
This is it, Santo Domingo Savio.
Hey, kids!
Where's the grocery store?
What was that name?
"The Kingdom of Heaven."
Up there, by the soccer field.
I won't wait for you.
You'll have to get back on your own.
He hadn't been here in a long while.
He and my other husband,
they were always fighting.
My husband drank a lot.
When he was drunk
he was impossible, gross.
They didn't get on.
So Alexis stopped coming.
I don't know where he hung out.
Or what his problems were.
I know he loved me.
He didn't tell me,
but I know he did.
My brother Alexis got killed.
Got shot right there.
I know who did it.
Liar, you don't know!
Yes, I do.
"The Blue Lagoon"!
A kid from around La Francia.
He's sworn he'll kill him.
Yes, I'll kill him, I'll kill him!
You know why?
How would I know?
I came to give you this
for the kids.
You're the writer?
Where's your son?
He left for the U.S.
Another drink?
No, I'm leaving.
Funds for education
will be increased by 60%/%.
By the end of my mandate,
90%/% of Colombians
will have running water
and main sewers.
Who's he?
The President.
No, it isn't.
Then who is it?
Someone else. Another scumbag.
What's his name?
What's the date today?
March 3rd.
The year's already over?
Hi, you OK?
OK.
I saw you on TV.
I've never been on TV. And you?
Me, neither.
So we're both fucked.
We might as well not exist.
People who aren't on TV
don't exist.
What are you up to?
Nothing much. Hanging out.
- You had lunch?
- Two days ago.
Then I'll buy you lunch.
I was fucking starving, man!
Like a pothead.
But I don't smoke pot.
Or crack. Nothing.
That's not good.
We should indulge in every vice
to make sure we're alive.
Virtue is for the dead.
Ever seen a dead person
fuck his neighbor's wife?
What's your name? Don't tell me...
Let me guess.
Faber?
Eder?
Tyson Alexander?
Jason?
Wilfer?
Wilmar.
Thanks for lunch.
That's OK.
So I'll see you.
See you soon.
I'm going to the Church of San Antonio.
If you want to come...
It's open! Let's go in.
How strange!
I've never been in this church,
but it feels so familiar.
In the back there's
a Holy Sepulchre and some tombs.
I'm sure of it.
You see? How weird!
It's incredible.
I'd never seen
this side of the church.
"House of God, the Door to Heaven."
As a kid I thought I'd die
if I entered this church.
So I never went inside.
Then why does it seem so familiar?
Where have I read that inscription?
Maybe I went in alive
and now I'm dead?
It's empty?
Empty?
Can't you see that table?
There's a bed in the bedroom.
There's no music!
Not even a hifi!
Not even.
I'm training
for the silence of the grave.
Come here.
That's all the clothes you have?
Plus what I have on,
which I don't need now.
Get undressed, kid.
I bet you have another
on your left ankle.
How'd you know?
I'm psychic.
Are you OK?
Not really.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
At night my head starts spinning
and I remember things.
Maybe you should leave.
What are we gonna do?
I don't know.
Whatever you want.
What's it for?
In case I need it.
Mine was a dumb question.
That's what a gun's for:
in case one needs it.
Let's go for breakfast.
Write what you want out of life
on these tiny napkins.
What's all this? Weird handwriting!
Looks like Chinese.
What brand sneakers?
Reebok.
What else? You read.
Paco Rabanne blue jeans,
three Ocean Pacific T-shirts,
Calvin Klein shorts,
a Honda bike,
a mini-Uzi,
a Whirlpool fridge for my mom.
Now you write
what you want out of life.
I hate goddamn cab drivers
with loud radios!
You should've told him
to turn it off.
My policy for living in peace
in this war zone is:
look, listen and shut up.
And no one will change my mind.
What about the phone?
Does it work?
I don't know.
And I don't care.
I don't call anybody
and nobody calls me.
Sure. How can it work
if it's disconnected?
Who could it be?
Yes? Who do you want to speak to?
Check or cash, whatever you like.
We don't cheat anyone here.
You can send it right away.
I'm Honore de Balzac.
Who am I speaking to?
John Jairo Arbelaez?
Okay, John Jairo, I'll be waiting.
See you soon.
Poor guy! He'll show up
with his truckload of plants.
And there'll be nobody there.
You're a bastard!
I have to keep myself busy.
I hate people who whistle.
My brother used to whistle
at all times.
Like you and I breathe.
Man has no business stealing
the sacred language of birds!
I'm a firm defender
of animal rights.
Something bothering you, fucker?
Alexis, kid, wake up.
Sorry, Wilmar.
What happened?
It just hit me.
I knew that guy you offed.
Who was it?
A mugger.
I saw him
hold up a guy in a Jeep.
The guy put up a fight
and he shot him.
That's divine justice.
Or Satan's justice,
since God is such a failure.
His dumb son Jesus
tried to abolish an eye for an eye,
and spread all that crap
about turning the other cheek.
Blessed art thou, Satan!
God neglects us, so you've come
to right the wrongs of this world.
OK, let's sleep.
What's up, dude!
"The Pest"! Good to see you!
Things OK?
Fine. I knocked up my girlfriend
to have a kid to avenge me.
Who from?
Anyone. Anything I can't handle
once I'm dead.
Congratulations, Pest.
At least our youth has foresight!
When there's a future,
the present takes care of itself.
And as to the past...
The past is what's fucking me up.
Why do you date
the guy who killed Alexis?
What? The guy who killed Alexis?
I'm with Wilmar.
Alexis was killed by "The Blue Lagoon".
Wilmar is "The Blue Lagoon".
Why does he have
that absurd nickname?
From the movie.
He looked like the kid in the movie.
He used to dye his hair blond.
I never saw that movie.
I don't go to movies now.
You coming?
OK, see you.
You know that kid?
He's from the hills, too?
From Santo Domingo Savio.
Like you?
No, I'm from La Francia.
You want one?
I'll wait for you here.
Enlighten me...
Lord, help me kill that bastard.
Why were you so weird all day?
What did I do?
Why are we going to a motel?
I don't get you.
Don't mind me, I'm superstitious.
I got obsessed:
if I stayed home tonight I'd get killed.
By who?
I don't know.
Don't ask questions.
I'm worried, that's all.
Turn it off.
So you're "The Blue Lagoon"?
Why did you kill Alexis?
He killed my brother.
I was with Alexis
the night you killed him.
I know.
When we met and became friends,
I recognized you.
So from that first night
in my apartment
you could've killed me?
I could never kill you.
I love you.
Who was driving the motorbike
you shot him from?
A kid from the barrio.
He got offed 2 days later.
Why? Who killed him?
No one knows.
They may never find out.
All this butchery leads nowhere.
Let's leave.
Where to?
We'll see. Wherever.
There's a world beyond this valley
and those mountains.
Sure, people are the same all over.
Same crap, but different.
Then let's buy a fridge
for my mom and split.
I like this one.
What's that for?
To make ice cubes. Look!
Can it make a whisky on the rocks?
Not state-of-the-art!
Doesn't matter.
My mom doesn't drink.
Can you deliver it?
No, I'll go with them.
Or they'll get ripped off.
- Rip off a refrigerator?
- The truck, too!
Anyway, I want to say goodbye
to my mom.
Of course.
Don't be too long,
I'll wait at the apartment.
Then we'll pack and leave.
See you later.
Yes, that's me.
Where did you find him?
Where is he now?
Where's that?
No, I don't know that either...
I'm on my way.
That's him!
Wait over there, please.
"Cause of death: cardio-respiratory
failure due to blood loss."
The clerk in the DA's office noted
the boy had
your phone number on him.
He was shot
from a motorcycle.
