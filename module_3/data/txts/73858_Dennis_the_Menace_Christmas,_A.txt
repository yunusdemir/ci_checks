Mr. Wilson!
Dennis.
What is it, George?
Another one of your dreams?
It wasn't a dream, Martha.
It was a nightmare.
A nightmare.
Hey, Mitchell.
Nice bike. Where did you get it,
the junkyard?
How about a race? You and me.
Last one to school is a loser.
Guess that will be you, loser.
Loser!
Just wait, Jack Bratcher.
One day I'm gonna beat you.
- That will be 50 cents, Henry Mitchell.
- No discounts for husbands?
- Not today. Where's Dennis?
- He's backstage with the rest of the kids.
- It looks like this'll be quite a show.
- Oh, I hope not.
Just relax, it's gonna be fine.
All he has to do is say his lines...
...and walk off stage with the rest of
the kids. What could possibly go wrong?
Hey, Mr. Turkey.
How are you doing in there?
He doesn't look so happy.
Whatever he is,
just keep that thing away from me.
- I'm allergic to turkey feathers.
- Hey, guys.
- And what are you supposed to be?
- A green bean casserole.
What's that smell?
I'm wearing cranberry perfume.
It's all the rage in Paris.
Boys are so unsophisticated.
My, isn't this lovely, George?
George?
George, you know,
I could have delivered my pie myself.
Oh, nonsense, Martha.
Now, George, you're just gonna have
to get over this.
Dennis Mitchell is just a boy.
Yes, like a hurricane is just a hurricane.
George, Dennis is going to be
all the way up on the stage...
...and you're going to be
all the way down here in the audience.
What could possibly go wrong?
I understand, Mr. Bratcher,
but we have a lot...
...of children in the show.
- But you have only got one Jack Bratcher.
And I wanna see him front and center
in the spotlight.
I'll do what I can.
Showtime.
All right, children, let's get ready.
All right, now listen to me.
When you get out there...
...I don't care
if you have to knock someone down.
You get in front. You got it?
- Yeah, Dad.
- And don't forget your lines.
I don't want people to think
I'm a bad parent. Now give me five.
Got you.
Hey, dork face.
Dennis, I think he's talking to you.
Yeah, I'm talking to you, snail boy.
Nice race today, loser.
I'm not a loser.
Really?
Then how come I beat you today?
Because you're a loser.
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm gonna ask Santa
for a new bike this Christmas...
...then life in this town is gonna change.
Please.
Christmas is so totally...
...stupid.
You just said the S word.
Okay, thank you, Merle. Thanks.
Thank you, Merle.
Thank you. Okay, Merle, stop it, okay?
Well, goodness.
How did all of you people
get into my office?
Thank you, thank you. And thank you all
for coming out tonight.
On behalf of the staff and the students
of Franklin Elementary...
...I would like to welcome you all
to our Thanksgiving pageant...
...bake sale and pie baking contest.
Tonight I'm looking forward
to tasting all of our ladies' goodies.
So we're going to begin
a very special history lesson...
...from Mrs. Walsh-Mellman's
first graders...
...who have put together their own
version of how Thanksgiving came to be.
And now without any further ado...
What's the matter, Mr. Turkey?
Are you thirsty?
- First grade class and their
story of Thanksgiving.
The children have worked
very hard on this...
...so I know we're all in for a real treat.
- Where's Dennis?
- Including...
A special surprise guest...
I'll be right back.
But let me just say that I think you're all
going to gobble up this presentation.
And so the pilgrims
and their new Native American friends...
...shared their bounty
and started a tradition...
...that has lasted even today.
Here you go.
The tradition of Thanksgiving.
My turkey feather allergy.
Get it away from me!
I told you something was going
to go wrong. Let's get out of here.
Hey, don't just stand there, fight back.
- Oh, no.
- Food fight!
Oh, no.
Maybe it's part of the show.
Keep moving, Martha.
Keep moving.
- Henry, do something.
- Okay, all right.
- Right here. Right here. Right here.
- That's not what I meant.
- Go get Dennis.
- Right.
I'm hit.
Dennis Mitchell.
I think we made it.
George?
George, are you all right, dear?
Oh, my apple pears pie is ruined.
Dennis!
And another thing.
If you think my insurance company...
...is paying for this catastrophe,
you're nutso.
But, Mr. Bratcher,
you did sell us an insurance policy.
Oh, yeah?
Well, look at this, bucko.
Read the fine print.
- "The Dennis Clause."
- The Dennis Clause?
It absolves my company
of responsibility...
...in the event of any and all disasters
caused by one Dennis Mitchell.
I'm sorry, but it's true.
After the unfortunate kindergarten
show-and-smell incident...
...they added the Dennis Clause
to our policy.
This is just ridiculous.
- He's a 6-year-old boy.
- That's right.
And you were the same way
when we were kids.
Always getting into trouble. Your
old man having to clean up your mess.
And still...
Happy-go-lucky all the time.
What's up with that?
Yeah, what's up with that?
I guess the apple doesn't fall
far from the tree, huh?
Dennis Clause.
Sorry.
But I didn't mean for it to happen.
The turkey looked thirsty.
Dennis...
...you're gonna have to start
taking responsibility for your...
- Your situations.
- I'll work it off. I promise.
Hey, I can wash windows.
- No.
- No.
Sorry.
Do the dishes?
- No.
- No.
Hey, Dad, what if I help you change
the oil in the car?
- No.
- No.
I'm gonna get a drink of water.
We'll talk about this later, okay?
<i>Oh, not looking good, Alice.</i>
This coming on the heels
of the Halloween disaster.
That wasn't all Dennis' fault.
They shouldn't have stacked
those pumpkins so high.
Regardless, there's not gonna be
a lot of money left over for Christmas.
Well...
...they're hiring down at the mall.
Oh, Alice...
They had a sign up
looking for a gift wrapper.
- I've always been very good with bows.
- Honey, I hate for you to have to do that.
It's only temporary.
Just to get us through the holidays.
Dennis is gonna be on vacation,
home from school.
I'll call Dad. He loves
spending time with his grandson.
I thought he was climbing
Mount Kilimanjaro.
Well, he's supposed to be back
on Sunday.
Well, I suppose we have no choice.
Who could've planned on the unexpected
expenses of a spirited child?
Henry, he's a boy. He'll grow out of it.
Let's hope.
Hey, Ruff, what am I gonna do?
Well, I'm here. Now what?
That's what I want. The Razzle Dazzle
Beauty Center with sparkle attachment...
...and automatic color changer.
It's beautiful.
What do you want, Joey?
Me? I just want it to snow in time
for Christmas.
My mom says it hasn't snowed
for Christmas in 30 years.
She says it's the global warming.
Cool, the Mite-Y-Max racing bike.
- Wow, it's... It's...
- Majestic.
Well, if it isn't Mr. Snail
and the snailettes.
- Get lost, Jack.
- Make me.
- Maybe I will.
- You'll have to catch me first.
That'd be way too easy.
As if, Mitchell.
You're so slow you couldn't catch a cold
in a snowstorm.
Oh, yeah? Well, you wait until
Christmas. Then you'll be the loser.
You daring me to a race, Mitchell?
Okay. A race.
You and me. Christmas Day.
Unless you're too chicken.
You're on, Jack Bratcher.
You're so going down.
You can't win, Dennis.
Yeah, everybody knows Jack
gots the fastest bike at school.
Don't worry, guys.
This race is in the bag.
All I need is a little help
from Santa Claus.
Come on, honey.
It's time for the secret Santa draw.
I wanna thank everyone
for coming again this year.
We all know what to do, right?
We do, okay. Pass it around.
Hey, Henry, do you think you can pull
some snow out of that hat?
I wish.
It hasn't snowed at Christmas
around here in how long?
Thirty years.
Hey, come on, everybody. Just because
there's no snow on the ground...
...doesn't mean we can't have
a little Christmas in our hearts?
Pick a name, get a gift, spread
some Christmas cheer. No peeking.
"Mr. Wilson." Cool.
George, the lights are lovely this year.
Come and see.
I've seen the lights, Martha.
Every year, I have seen the lights.
Well, maybe this year we could
maybe just...
- No, no.
- Just a few little red...
...and green ones around the front porch.
- You know how I feel about this thing.
It's shameless capitalism at its worst.
Besides, it's a waste of electricity.
- Yes, dear.
- I'm going to look at my stamps.
Yes, dear. Have a nice time.
Okay, so far we have presents...
...a Christmas tree, cookies and lights.
Who can tell me one more thing...
...that represents the Christmas spirit
to them?
Dennis?
Yes, Mrs. Walsh-Mellman?
Do you have a fifth thing to add
to our list of Christmas spirit?
That's easy. Santa Claus.
Very good, Dennis. Santa Claus it is.
Well, now aren't you happy
we came out for a walk?
I suppose.
- But...
- But?
- I just wish it would snow.
- Oh, Martha.
You know it hasn't snowed around here
at Christmas time for 30 years.
I know, but it just does not seem
like Christmas without snow.
It seems to be perfect just the way it is.
Fresh air.
Nothing but peace and quiet.
Oh, no.
- What?
- Come on, honey.
Mr. Wilson. Hey, Mr. Wilson.
Hey, Mrs. Wilson.
Hello, dear. George, say hello to Dennis.
- Dennis.
- Do you know what today is?
It's the start of Christmas vacation.
- School's out for two weeks.
- Marvelous.
Are you excited for Christmas,
Mr. Wilson?
- Actually...
- Are you excited, dear?
You better believe it.
It's my favorite holiday ever.
So you got your Christmas list made yet,
Mr. Wilson?
- As a matter of fact...
- Do you have a list made, Dennis?
Yup.
And there's only one thing on it.
- Do you know what it is?
- I'm afraid to ask.
The Mite-Y-Max racing bike.
Then I'll be the fastest kid in town.
I've been pretty good this year, too,
so it's as good as mine.
- George.
- So, Mr. Wilson...
- Don't you want anything for Christmas?
- Well...
You know, dear, Mr. Wilson
isn't a big fan of Christmas.
It dates back to his days
when he was a postal worker.
I threw my back out every year...
...delivering those stupid letters
to Santa Claus.
You said the S word.
George, don't say stupid.
It's not nice.
I'm sorry, but Christmas...
Nothing but shameless capitalism.
I'm sorry, Dennis, but we're going
to have to be going now.
You have a lovely holiday.
This is gonna be harder than I thought.
What do you mean,
there's no other way out of Tanzania?
Three days?
By yak.
I gotta go. I'll figure something out.
I gotta go.
Yeah, I love you too. Bye.
No Grandpa?
Don't ever ask someone
climbing Mount Kilimanjaro to babysit.
How about a babysitter?
Oh, yeah. Okay, what's plan B?
I'll bet I can find something
for Mr. Wilson's Christmas present here.
Please, Dennis, not today.
Just stay with me, okay?
Oh, Mom.
Oh, it's just too much. Too much.
I had four Santas the past week.
All the four of them quit
within 15 minutes of taking the job.
So if you don't work out...
...I'm going to close the whole thing.
- You can count on me.
Because this is not just a job,
this is something I have to do.
If I can give the spirit of Christmas
to at least one person...
- Well, then...
- Oh, yes. Well, that's wonderful.
- Now do you mind if we do the fitting?
- Mr. Souse?
Sousez. Not Souse, Sousez.
Oh, Mrs. Mitchell,
how nice of you to join us.
Thank you. I'm sorry,
I couldn't find a babysitter.
Dad says we're blacklisted.
Oh, really?
How interesting.
Mrs. Mitchell, they're going to want you
at the wrapping table.
I'll be there in a moment. Go on.
- Okay, come on, honey.
- Go, go. Go, go.
Now, Robert, about that fitting.
How did you do that?
I like to be prepared.
Sit over there, okay?
Okay, honey, now you stay put.
And please stay out of trouble.
Relax, Mom. I'll be fine.
I'll take those.
Thank you.
Merry Christmas. Who's next?
Great. Oh, aren't you sweet.
Thank you. Yes, my son is over there.
Isn't he adorable?
Yes, thanks. See you later.
Merry Christmas.
Number 36?
Well, it's about time.
Have a happy holiday.
I don't see how we're supposed to
do that without snow.
They say it hasn't snowed around here
at Christmas time for about...
Thirty years, I know, I know.
It's just not natural,
no snow at Christmas.
What are you doing?
Dennis.
Dennis.
- Look what you did.
- Get me up.
Goodness, gracious. What in the name
of heaven is going on here?
This child. This deplorable little boy...
...grabbed me in my private area.
Madame, please.
Okay, honey, time to go.
What little boy?
That one right there.
He was right there.
I'm sure he was right there.
This is going to be a long Christmas.
Look at that.
I found one.
I actually found one. Martha.
Martha.
Martha, I found one. A 1954...
Oh, Alice, of course
we'll babysit Dennis.
What?
I would never ask
unless I was desperate.
Don't give it a second thought,
we'd love to.
- What?
- Thank you both so much.
I'll be home at 5:30.
Hey, Mr. Wilson.
Looks like I'm your new roommate.
- What?
- Oh, nothing.
Then why are you
staring at me like that?
No reason. I was just wondering...
...what someone like you
would be interested in.
I am interested
in reading this newspaper.
I mean, you know,
like a hobby or something.
Or a gift you would like.
My hobby is reading the newspaper.
And I would like the gift of silence.
- Well, I'm off.
- Oh, where are you going?
Oh, I have a few errands to run, dear.
- You're leaving me home with...
- George.
- You're leaving me alone?
- Lf you want dinner tonight I am.
Now, Dennis, I saved these crayons
from your last visit.
- So...
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
Now, you boys be good,
and I'll be back soon.
Now what?
I don't know what to draw.
Why don't you try writing a letter
to Santa Claus?
I already e-mailed him.
Then just...
...color something.
What to draw?
There's gotta be something
Mr. Wilson needs for Christmas...
...and I'm gonna find it.
Mr. Wilson sure has
a lot of letters to mail.
I'm home.
George?
- Just reading the paper, Martha.
- Where's Dennis?
Off with his crayons someplace.
Well, his crayons are here, dear.
Dennis.
Dennis.
Dennis, where are you, dear?
Oh, dear.
Oh, no.
Oh, hi. Good news, Mr. Wilson.
Your mail is all ready to go.
My stamps.
Now, dear,
remember your blood pressure.
And look at this one.
Hey, Mr. Wilson,
what's the matter with your face?
- Dennis!
<i>- I don 't want him around my house.</i>
<i>I don 't want him anywhere near me.</i>
Of course, Mr. Wilson.
You will be completely reimbursed.
Okay, you have a good night.
And again, we are very sorry...
Hello?
- Ten thousand dollars.
- For stamps?
Yes, it was a collection.
Apparently a lot of antiques.
Don't they have insurance?
- They have the Dennis Clause.
- Dennis Clause.
What are we gonna do, Henry?
We don't have that kind of money.
It's Christmas. We have to buy gifts.
Dennis wants that racing bike so badly.
We will manage somehow.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Dennis.
Dennis?
Dennis? Son, what are you doing?
Well, I thought that maybe
if I could figure out...
...the right gift to get Mr. Wilson
for Christmas...
...he wouldn't be mad anymore.
Except even if I could figure it out...
...I don't have any money
to get him anything.
Well, Dennis, that's the great thing
about Christmas.
It's not about the money.
Christmas is about...
...thoughtfulness
and kindness and good will.
It's the gesture of giving a gift
that counts, not the gift.
It's about family...
...friends...
...and love.
I think what Daddy is trying to say is
sometimes the best gifts are free.
I love you, Alice.
I love you, Henry.
Hello? I'm in the room.
You have to think a little harder.
You'll come up with something.
I know you will. There we go.
What do you think, Ruff?
What can I give Mr. Wilson for Christmas
that he really, really needs?
That's it.
I'm gonna give Mr. Wilson
the Christmas spirit.
Hey, Mr. Wilson.
- Hello, Dennis.
- What you doing?
I'm going shopping for stamps. Alone.
Oh, I thought maybe you were gonna get
a present for Mrs. Wilson.
You know, for Christmas.
Mrs. Wilson and I do not exchange
Christmas presents.
We haven't for years.
But I thought Mrs. Wilson
liked Christmas.
She likes Christmas,
but she doesn't like presents.
Are you sure about that?
Well, she has never come right out
and said so but...
So how do you know?
I hate shopping.
Especially during the holidays.
All the crowds, the noise...
...those awful blaring Christmas carols.
How's a person supposed to think?
That's okay, Mr. Wilson.
I brought backup.
- What?
- Hi, Mr. Wilson.
- Come on, Mr. Wilson, come on.
- We're going to help you.
See, Mr. Wilson?
I told you we'd help you.
Well...
...Martha will sure be pleased.
- Here you go, Mr. Wilson.
- Here you go, Mr. Wilson.
- Be careful, Mr. Wilson.
- Oh, don't worry about me, Dennis.
I was a dancer in my youth.
Two-time regional division
tap-dance champion.
There it is.
- What is?
- The Mite-Y-Max.
- A bicycle.
- It's majestic.
Do you even know
what that word means?
Hey, Mitchell.
Ready to lose on Christmas Day? Loser.
What an unfortunate little boy.
Hey, Mr. Wilson,
you dropped your present.
Mr. Wilson, I thought
you said you could dance.
I hate Christmas.
Yes, dear.
Thank you for sharing, Connie.
We have a new member tonight...
...and I'd like you all
to make her feel welcome.
- Go ahead.
- Hello, everyone.
My name is Alice...
...and I have a spirited child.
- Hello, Alice.
How lucky can you get? We need
a Christmas tree for Mr. Wilson...
...and we find one just sitting there.
Right on the sidewalk.
Must be your lucky day.
He's gonna be so surprised
when he gets home from the hospital.
- This tree is filthy.
- It's called nature, Margaret.
It's called gross.
It's locked.
It's open. Excellent.
Okay.
Just point the tree in my direction.
On the count of three.
One.
Two.
Three.
There's a Christmas tree in here.
That's him. That's the guy.
George Wilson, you're under arrest...
<i>...theft of a Christmas tree, one count.</i>
- I unload my tree from the car...
...we go into the house to use the can,
we come back out and it's gone.
- Yeah, it's gone.
<i>- You have the right to remain silent.</i>
<i>Anything you say can and will be</i>
<i>used against you in a court of law.</i>
<i>You have the right to an attorney.</i>
<i>- I didn 't take your Christmas tree.</i>
- I saw the kids drag it into your house.
- You're the ringleader.
<i>- Don 't worry, dear.</i>
<i>I'll bail you out of the slammer.</i>
<i>Dennis.</i>
- Hey, Mitchell.
- Hello, Mr. Bratcher, how are you?
I'm great.
I just sold five more insurance policies,
all of them with Dennis Clauses.
Your kid's gonna make me rich.
Loser.
Is Mr. Wilson okay?
Yes, dear. He just had a rough night
in jail, that's all.
Dennis, I'm gonna run to the drug store
very quickly...
...before Mr. Wilson wakes up...
...and get him some more
of his special medication.
Can you promise me that you'll stay
right here with him until I get back?
I promise.
Very good, dear. Okay, I'll be right back.
Time to bake cookies.
Kind of boring.
Mr. Wilson, I made you something.
They look delicious...
...but Mrs. Wilson doesn't allow me
to have cookies.
They're bad for my blood pressure.
Not even one?
Maybe just one. After all, it is Christmas.
Now, Dennis, you're going to have
to tell the doctor...
...exactly what you put in those cookies.
- Is Mr. Wilson gonna be okay?
- Yes, dear.
He'll be fine.
Just as soon as they pump his stomach.
Dennis.
Hey, Mitchell, I'm waiting for you.
Loser!
Why does he gotta be such a bully?
He probably hasn't gotten in touch
with his true inner self.
It's genetic, like musical talent
or exceptional good looks.
My dad says people are bullies because
they don't get enough love at home.
They just need a little more patience,
support...
...kindness from members of their
communities to turn themselves around.
Okay, now that's just gross.
Okay, this is the last one. Ready, guys?
Set.
And jump.
Perfect. When Mr. Wilson gets home
from the hospital tonight...
...he's going to be so happy.
Yeah, what could possibly go wrong?
All right, be careful, dear.
Thank you.
We'll go inside and I'll make you
a nice cup of clear broth.
Look at the lights.
George, remember your blood pressure.
I am so sorry, Mr. Wilson.
We'll pay for everything,
don't you worry about that.
We'll pay for everything somehow.
Oh, God.
How bad is it?
You don't wanna know.
<i>And now, sit back, relax</i>
<i>and enjoy our presentation...</i>
<i>... of</i> Children of the Damned.
<i>We'll return to</i> The Bad Seed
<i>after these messages.</i>
Rosemary's Baby <i>right after this.</i>
- Maybe we should read.
- Yeah, read.
Hey, slug.
Enjoy Christmas Eve tonight.
Because tomorrow is the day you lose.
I hope you put that jerk in his place,
Dennis Mitchell.
It doesn't matter.
- What?
- Tomorrow's Christmas.
And the only thing left
on my Christmas spirit list...
...to give Mr. Wilson is Santa Claus.
How the heck am I gonna do that?
You wanna come and play ball with us
or something?
Get your mind off it?
All right, merry Christmas. Merry... Hello.
No. Thanks anyways.
You guys go on. I'll see you later.
- Hi.
- Yo, what's up? Oh, hey.
- Merry Christmas.
- You're the Santa from the mall, right?
I was, all right? I lost that gig.
So, what are you doing out here?
Hello? I'm trying to spread
the Christmas spirit.
If I can give it to just one person,
one person.
Maybe you can help my friend Joey.
He really wants snow for Christmas.
Snow? Oh, man. It hasn't snowed
on Christmas here in 30 years.
You need to put a dollar in this bucket.
Wait a minute. What did you say?
I said what you need is a dollar
in this bucket.
No, before that.
Did you say Christmas spirit?
- That's right. See, I came here to-
- Do you need to give it to somebody?
- Yeah.
- You know what, Santa?
I know just the guy.
Martha?
Martha, what's going on?
I was just trying to warm up the room.
That hole in the wall makes it
a little drafty in here.
There must be something stuck
in the chimney.
What the dickens is going on?
What are you doing up there?
Ho, ho, ho, Mr. Winston.
Get down off my roof, you idiot.
The name is Wilson.
Hey, Mr. Wilson. Surprise.
Dennis. I might have known
you'd have something to do with this.
That's right. I'm your secret Santa.
- You're my what?
- Your secret Santa.
You be quiet up there. And get down.
What is it, George?
It's Santa Claus.
I found him in the park...
...and I brought him here to give
Mr. Wilson the Christmas spirit.
- Oh, that's nice, dear.
- You found him in the park...
...and you brought him here
to my home?
Merry Christmas, Mr. Wilson.
- Yeah, merry Christmas, Mr. Winston.
- Wilson!
So you got the Christmas spirit yet,
Mr. Wilson?
I need some help.
Come on, Santa.
Give me a break.
- I'm trying to spread the spirit.
- Yeah.
- In the car.
- Can't we all get along?
- We'll get along at the station. In the car.
- Watch the hat. It's expensive.
George, dear?
I brought someone to see you.
I'm gonna leave you two boys alone.
Mr. Wilson?
Now what?
I just came to say I'm sorry.
For everything.
Here, I made you a card.
You stay away from here.
Stay away from my wife,
from my home, from me.
But, Mr. Wilson...
Don't say my name.
Forget you ever knew me.
You're nothing but trouble,
Dennis Mitchell.
You're a menace.
Now, go away.
I never wanna see you again.
And one more thing.
There is no such thing as Santa Claus.
I had you on my good list.
I had toys for you guys.
Now you're on my bad list.
Guess who's naughty, both of you.
Don't worry, Santa. We'll get you back
to the North Pole on time.
Pull over, Stenski.
Pull over. We lost Santa Claus.
<i>- Merry Christmas, everyone.</i>
<i>- But it isn 't until Tuesday, mum.</i>
<i>Well, we need it now,</i>
<i>so let's go ahead and have it.</i>
<i>Norah, Ito.</i>
<i>Patrick.</i>
<i>Oh, I did want to pay you</i>
<i>some of your back salary...</i>
<i>Now not another word about it, mum.</i>
<i>You know we wouldn 't think</i>
<i>of leaving you.</i>
<i>Oh, it's isn 't seventeen jewels,</i>
<i>Ito.</i>
<i>But I'm not sure that time is worth</i>
<i>all that decoration these days.</i>
Hey, Martha.
I'm coming.
Don't be afraid.
I'm here to help you, Mr. Wilson.
Hey, that's my ice bucket.
Sorry. I knew I should've gone
for a smaller set of wings.
You know how it is. You're in
a rush, rushing out the door...
...and you grab anything that could fit.
- Wait.
Wait, you're the jerk that was stuck
in my chimney tonight.
Well, you can call me jerk
if you want to but I prefer Bob.
Yeah, Bob, jerk, or whatever
your name is, I'm calling the police.
How did you...?
What, do I got to spell it out for you,
Georgie? Come on.
The suit, the wings, it's Christmas.
This guy...
I guess that was valuable to you too,
huh?
Sorry. It's a nice lamp.
You're an angel.
Not exactly. More like...
Let's see, the Christmas spirit.
That was a close one.
Spirit?
I'm dead.
He did it to me, didn't he?
Dennis.
He finished me off.
No, no, you're not dead.
Well, at least not in the traditional sense.
What is that supposed to mean?
- Let me show you.
- I'm not going anywhere with you.
But, Georgie...
Anything. All right, I'll go,
as long as you get out of my house.
Sounds good to me. Hold on.
Why?
Hey, this...
- This flying is all right.
- Really?
I could never get the hang of it, man.
What?
Where are we?
Mr. Newman. Mr. Newman.
That's me.
Mr. Newman.
Boy, you were such a cute kid.
What happened?
- Oh, Georgie.
- Look, Mr. Newman.
Here's a picture of it in my comic.
"The Fabulous Freddy Fishing Rod."
- Yeah, isn't it swell?
- Yeah.
The one I told you about.
I send the picture to Santa...
...and he'll know exactly what I want.
Yes, I'm sure he can hardly wait.
The things I do in the name
of neighborliness.
He was a very patient man.
Really?
<i>Folks, today I have good news</i>
<i>from Hollywood.</i>
<i>The little girl with the big dimples</i>
<i>and the sunshine in her eye.</i>
<i>June Allyson, star of...</i>
Mrs. Newman left you
some crayons and paper.
She should be back from the market
any time now.
Swell. I think I'll work
on my letter to Santa.
Good.
And just stay out of trouble
until your mother gets home from work.
- Sure, Mr. Newman.
- Go, go, go, go.
That can't be right.
Mr. Newman?
- Yeah?
- You got any stamps?
- Yeah, around here somewhere.
- Okey-dokey, dominokey.
Where were you going?
I remember this.
Gosh, I wonder why Mr. Newman
left his boats out here.
I better put them back
where they belong.
No, no, no. No.
No, no.
Don't do it. Don't do it.
He can't hear you.
That's not good.
I've gotta stop this.
Mr. Newman, go upstairs, now.
- I told you, he can't hear you.
- Mr. Newman.
- There's nothing you can do.
- Go upstairs now.
Georgie.
Georgie!
You were really something, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess I was.
That was the year that I accidentally
knocked all the power out to the city.
It took them three days
to turn it back on again.
I never did get that fishing rod.
Come on. We got places to go.
Are we done?
Nope, not yet.
Hey, that's me.
Nice way to spend Christmas Eve, huh?
You lucked out with that one, Wilson.
I did, indeed.
Too bad you don't appreciate it.
Merry Christmas.
I didn't know.
No, you didn't.
What are we gonna do, Henry?
With the damage tonight
and the stamp collection...
...and everything else, we're gonna owe
Mr. Wilson $40,000.
It's actually closer to 45
but at this point, who's counting?
Well, they do owe me that money.
That child caused all the damages.
It's only fair.
Poor Dennis.
He wants that bike so desperately.
I know, honey. I wish we had
the money, but we don't.
He's gonna be heartbroken.
I know he's a handful
but he's a good boy.
And no child deserves to be heartbroken
on Christmas.
We're gonna have to sell the house,
aren't we?
A smaller place might be nice
for a change.
Cozy.
- What?
- But we're together...
...and that's all that matters.
Can't you do something?
If the Mitchells move...
...that means they're taking Dennis
with them.
Isn't that what you always wanted?
Mr. Wilson is right, Ruff.
I am a menace. I'm no good.
You heard Mr. Wilson.
There's no such thing as Santa Claus.
He said it, so it must be true.
I'm not gonna get
the Mite-Y-Max bike.
Jack'll win tomorrow
and I'll be a loser.
You know what, Ruff?
Christmas is stupid.
Oh, no.
The S word.
He said the S word.
This is bad, very bad.
Invisible, remember?
But not intangible.
Look, I got it, all right?
I'm Scrooge,
you're the ghost of Christmas.
I have to learn my lesson...
But this boy is suffering.
This has to stop right now.
Not yet.
Now where are we?
Is this the future?
<i>Happy holidays to all citizens.</i>
<i>Recycled air will be available free</i>
<i>tomorrow to all citizens...</i>
<i>... as a holiday gift from our beloved</i>
<i>twin presidents, Mary-Kate and Ashley.</i>
What's that smell?
Oh, they had to start adding sun block,
SPF 800, to the air around 2019.
I guess we should have listened
to Al Gore.
Oh, no.
Is that my house?
Yup.
You lived there with your wife
until she died. Rest her soul.
Then you lived there the rest
of your life...
...alone.
No family.
No friends even.
You pushed everyone away
until you were left with nothing.
It looks so lonely.
It is.
That's the Mitchells' house.
Why isn't it decorated?
Get out of here.
But, Mr. Mitchell, it's Christmas Eve.
I told you, I don't want a wreath.
I don't want lights.
I don't want any decorations.
I don't like Christmas.
Now get lost.
What happened to Henry?
Shameless capitalism, at its best.
Why is he such a crab?
Alice and Henry sold the house
back in '07...
...because of their massive debt
that they owed you.
Henry got a second job and so did Alice.
Their lives were never the same
after that.
Dennis swore his whole entire life
that he was gonna buy that house back.
From that point on,
that was his one goal.
He went to college on
a skateboard scholarship.
He got a really good job working
in an insurance company.
Well, there you go.
With adversity comes success.
But at what price?
He never had a family.
He never had kids.
He barely had any friends.
Where is he now?
Mr. Wilson...
...that's not Henry Mitchell.
Dennis?
His Christmas spirit was broken
way back then.
That's the year you told him
there was no Santa Claus.
No.
- We've got to do something.
- Don't waste your breath, Mr. Wilson.
Dennis, it's me.
Give it up, man. It's too late.
Forget what I said.
I was wrong.
I was wrong.
Christmas isn't stupid. It isn't.
- Please. Listen to me.
- Merry Christmas, George Wilson.
Dennis.
Where am I?
<i>Trying to sell you these wings.</i>
<i>These are the original wings.</i>
<i>There are seven left, folks. Seven left.</i>
<i>They just sold it, it's going like hotcakes.</i>
<i>Please buy these wings.</i>
<i>Heavenly bodies are trying</i>
<i>to give you these wings so you can fly.</i>
- Dennis?
<i>- Look at these feathers made of goose.</i>
<i>Real goose. This is not fake.</i>
<i>This is not something you get in</i>
<i>Chinatown. You know what I'm saying?</i>
Here, I made you a card.
Mr. Wilson, I'm sorry for everything.
<i>Have you got the Christmas spirit yet,</i>
<i>Mr. Wilson?</i>
It's Christmas.
I've got a lot of things to do.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, everyone.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, everyone.
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Yes.
- Do you want some coffee, honey?
- Yeah.
- Henry.
- Yeah?
- Henry.
- What?
No way.
He brought it. He brought it.
There is a Santa Claus.
- Did you?
- No.
- Did you?
- No.
- Santa Claus?
- Santa Claus?
Mind if I come in?
It's freezing out there.
Now...
...this is an itemized list of the debts
that you owe me.
Look, Mr. Wilson, I said
we were gonna pay you the money.
I was gonna...
Pay you soon.
Merry Christmas, Henry.
Merry Christmas.
Are you okay, Mr. Wilson?
Alice, my dear, I have never been better.
What about the money?
The Dennis Clause?
Forget about that.
I'm gonna call the school...
...they owe me a few favors.
I'll see what they have to say.
Thank you, Mr. Wilson.
George. Well, heck.
You can call me Georgie.
Georgie.
Mr. Wilson, look. I got my bike.
Santa brought my bike.
And well, he should have.
You deserve it.
You have been a very good boy
this year.
You...
You are a very good person,
Dennis Mitchell.
And I'm quite happy to know you.
You okay, Mr. Wilson?
Dennis...
...I'm better than okay.
I'm majestic.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, Mr. Wilson.
George?
George, I slept so late.
There's a Christmas tree
in our living room.
George.
Well, what do you think?
George,
you shouldn't have done all this.
Of course I should have.
I should have done it a long,
long time ago, Martha.
And if you promise to forgive me
for being an old grouch...
...I promise I'll make up for all
the lost Christmases we've ever had.
George, they were never lost...
...you old grouch.
We were always together...
...and that's all the Christmas
I ever needed.
I was saving this for your birthday...
...but since it's Christmas...
You mentioned this a long time ago.
<i>Look, Mr. Newman.</i>
<i>Here's a picture of it in my comic.</i>
"The Fabulous Freddy Fishing Rod."
Yeah, isn't it swell?
Martha.
Where did you ever find this?
Dennis taught me how to shop online.
You can find anything you want
out there.
Oh, Martha.
I've never had to look that far.
Oh, George.
All right, now listen to me.
Back off.
You're gonna go out there
and beat that Mitchell kid. You got it?
Yeah.
- What? I can't hear you.
- Yeah.
Look at me.
No Bratcher is a loser. Got it?
- Got it.
- Say it.
No Bratcher is a loser.
And if you don't come in first,
you're a what?
- A what?
- A loser.
Good.
Now go out there and show him
who's the fastest kid in town.
Yeah.
All right, son.
Drive safely.
Do your best. And remember,
no matter what happens...
...you're always a winner.
- Thanks.
Okay.
Good luck, Dennis. You might not lose.
Dennis, you need to beat this guy,
for all of us.
You can do it, I know you can.
I believe in you, Dennis Mitchell.
- Holy cow.
- Whatever.
All right, racers to the starting line.
First one to the end of the block
and back is the winner.
On your marks.
Get set.
Go.
Come on, Dennis.
Let's go. Don't be a loser.
Come on.
Go, Dennis!
You can do it, buddy!
Come on.
Faster. Beat him.
Do your best, son.
Don't be a loser.
<i>- The apple doesn 't fall far from the tree.</i>
<i>- Loser!</i>
Loser.
<i>Loser!</i>
Dennis.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Yeah.
That's it. All right, buddy.
That's my boy.
That's how the Bratchers do it, pal.
Right on. You see my kid?
My kid won.
Yeah, that's it, pal.
That's how the Bratchers do it, pal.
You're a winner. A winner.
And that kid over there...
- Good job, Dennis. Nice job.
- That kid...
...is a loser.
Say it.
Loser.
Let's go home.
Well, son...
...I know you did your best.
What do you say we go
have some hot chocolate?
- Be there in a minute, Dad.
- All right, buddy.
You let him win, didn't you?
He needed it more than I did.
Hey, Mitchell.
Thanks.
Merry Christmas, Jack.
Merry Christmas, Mitch...
Dennis.
It's snowing. It's snowing.
I knew it would snow.
Snow.
- Snow.
- Hot chocolate.
I just love happy endings.
Okay, I'm coming.
Look at the snow.
I don't remember seeing it snow
like this since I was a little girl.
Be right back.
- Getting cold out here.
- Yeah.
You want some?
No. L...
Come on, Bratcher, it's Christmas.
Thanks.
- Congratulations on the race.
- George, invite him in.
I'll be right in. I'm just going to shake
the snow off the bushes.
Mr. Wilson!
Mr. Wilson!
Dennis!
