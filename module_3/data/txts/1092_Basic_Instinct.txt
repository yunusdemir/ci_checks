Good morning, Detective.
Up there.
Good morning, Pete.
Who is this guy?
- Rock Er roll. Johnny Boz.
- Never heard of him.
- Before your time. Where are they?
- Upstairs, to the right.
He had some hits in the sixties.
He's got a club on Fillmore.
Not any more.
- Do we have a time of death?
- Almost.
- You guys know Captain Talcott.
- What's the Chief's Office doing?
Observing.
- What does it say?
- 92Â°. About 6 hours.
- He died around <i>2</i> a.m.
- Somebody close the drapes.
- The maid found him.
- Maybe the maid did it.
- She's 54 and weighs 240 pounds.
- There are no bruises on the body.
It ain't the maid.
He left the club with his girlfriend
about midnight.
- What was it?
- Ice pick, out on the coffee table.
There's come stains
all over the sheets.
- Very impressive.
- He got off, before he got off.
This is sensitive. Mr. Boz was a
contributor to the mayor's campaign.
- You said he was a rock star.
- He was a retired rock star.
- A very respectable rock star.
- Then what's that over there?
It looks like
very respectable cocaine.
I'll get a lot of heat on this.
I don't want any mistakes.
- What's Boz's girlfriend's name?
- Catherine Tramell. 162 Divisadero.
Always a pleasure, Captain.
He doesn't usually punch in
till after his 18 holes.
Johnny and the mayor were tight.
- Keep your 3 o'clock.
- You want the case ...?
I'll keep it.
We're with the San Francisco police.
We'd like to see Catherine Tramell.
Come in.
Just a moment.
Ain't that cute?
His and hers Picassos.
- You know Picasso?
- Sure. It says right here.
Hers is bigger.
Sorry to bother you.
We have a few questions.
- Are you Vice?
- No. Homicide.
When's the last time
you saw John Boz?
Is he dead?
- Why do you think that?
- You wouldn't be here otherwise.
Were you with him last night?
You're looking for Catherine, not me.
- Who are you?
- I'm Roxy.
I'm her friend.
Well, do you know
where your friend is?
She's at the beach house at Stinson.
Seadrift 1402.
Thanks.
You're wasting your time.
Catherine didn't kill him.
Gus.
Miss Tramell?
Good afternoon. We're with
the San Francisco police
I know who you are.
So, how did he die?
- He was murdered.
- Obviously. How was he murdered?
With an ice pick.
- How long were you dating him?
- I wasn't dating him.
- I was fucking him.
- What are you, a pro?
No, I'm an amateur.
- You've been having sex with him?
- For about a year and a half.
- You were with him last night.
- You left the club with him.
- Did you go home with him?
- No. We left together.
- He went home and I came out here.
- Was anyone with you last night?
No. I wasn't in the mood last night.
Let me ask you something.
Are you sorry he's dead?
Yeah. I liked fucking him.
- I don't feel like talking any more.
- We can do this downtown.
Read me my rights, arrest me.
Then I'll go downtown.
Otherwise, get the fuck out of here.
Please.
Nice girl.
Sorry, Beth.
I got hung up at Stinson.
- How are you, Nick?
- I'm fine.
- How long do we have to keep at this?
- That's up to Internal Affairs.
- Have a seat.
- It's bullshit. You know it is.
Sit down anyway,
so we can get it over with.
So how are things?
Things are fine.
I told you, things are fine.
- How's your personal life?
- My sex life is fine.
My sex life is actually pretty shitty
since I stopped seeing you.
I've started developing calluses.
Sorry.
- How's the booze?
- Haven't had a drink in three months.
- What about the coke?
- No.
I'm working my ass off. I'm off
the sauce. I even stopped smoking.
- How's not smoking?
- It sucks.
Now you tell I.A. I'm just an average,
healthy, totally fucked-up cop.
And let me out of here, please.
Yes.
Thank you.
I still miss you, Nick.
- They're waiting. How did it go?
- She misses me.
- When that girl mates, it's for life.
- Let's start. Harrigan?
31 stab wounds. No usable prints.
No forcible entry. Nothing missing.
No prints on the ice pick.
You can buy one at any K-Mart.
The scarf was Hermes. Expensive.
They sell about 20,000 a year.
The cocaine was high quality.
He inhaled it.
There were minute
quantities on his lips and penis.
Mr. Boz leaves $5 million. No direct
survivors. No criminal record.
- He liked drugs, girls, rock Er roll.
- He liked the mayor, too.
- What about his girlfriend?
- Is she a suspect?
Yes, she is. Catherine Tramell.
Age 30. No priors. No convictions.
Double major from Berkeley in 1983.
Literature and psychology.
Parents, Marvin and Elaine Tramell.
Died in a boating accident, 1979.
Catherine Tramell, sole heir,
estimated assets $110 million.
No shit?
- Formerly engaged to Manuel Vasquez.
- Manny Vasquez?
Middleweight contender.
Killed in the ring in 1984.
She's good for $100 million.
She fucks fighters and rock stars.
- She can screw with people's heads.
- And she's a writer.
She published a novel last year
under a pen name.
It's about a retired rock Er roll star
who gets murdered by his girlfriend.
Page 67, cowboy.
You know how she does the guy?
With an ice pick, in bed.
His hands are tied
with a white silk scarf.
Dr. Garner.
I've asked Dr. Lamott for help.
This isn't really my turf.
Dr. Lamott teaches the pathology
of psychopathic behaviour.
He's on the Justice Department's
psychological-profile team.
I see two possibilities.
One: The person who wrote this book
is your murderer.
And acted out this killing
in ritualistic, literal detail.
Two: Someone wants to harm
the writer by incriminating her.
- What if the writer did it?
- Then she has a very devious mind.
This book was written months,
if not years, before it was published.
She had to have planned the crime
subconsciously back then.
That she carried it out, indicates
psychopathic obsessive-behaviour, -
- in terms of the killing and the
applied advance-defence mechanism.
Sometimes I can't understand shit.
What was all that you just said?
She intended the book
to be her alibi.
Would anyone be stupid enough
to kill in a prescribed way?
What if it's not the writer,
but someone who read the book?
Then you're dealing
with someone so obsessed -
- they're willing to kill an innocent
victim in order to blame the author.
Deep-seated, obsessional hatred,
and a lack of respect for human life.
So we've got a top-of-the-line
looney-toon any way you cut it.
You're dealing with someone
very dangerous and very ill.
There's no case.
You've no physical evidence.
- She hasn't got an alibi.
- She hasn't got a motive.
Her defence would beat us to death.
Anybody could have done it.
What do we do now, nothing?
- We call her in for questioning.
- With her money, she'd burn us.
She was the last person seen with
the guy. I'll take the responsibility.
It's yours.
She'll waltz in here with her lawyer.
We're just wasting taxpayers' money.
- That's exactly what she'll do.
- No, she won't.
She won't hide behind anybody.
She won't hide at all.
Then she's as crazy
as you are, Curran.
You know what they say:
It takes one to know one.
We'd like you to come downtown
to answer a few questions.
- Are you arresting me?
- If that's the way you want it.
Can I change into something
more appropriate? Come on in.
Make yourselves comfortable.
I'll be right back.
- How long will this take?
- I don't know.
- Do you collect old newspapers?
- If they make interesting reading.
- I'm ready.
- You have the right to an attorney.
Why would I need an attorney?
- Do you have a cigarette?
- I don't smoke.
Yes, you do.
- I quit.
- Congratulations.
- I thought you were out?
- I found some. Have one.
- I told you, I quit.
- It won't last.
- Are you working on another book?
- Yes, I am.
It must really be something,
making stuff up.
It teaches you to lie.
How's that?
The stuff has to be believable.
It's called suspension of disbelief.
I like that! Suspension of disbelief.
What's your new book about?
A detective.
He falls for the wrong woman.
- What happens?
- She kills him.
I'm John Corelli,
Assistant District Attorney.
This is Capt. Talcott, and Lt. Walker.
- A cup of coffee?
- No, thank you.
- Is your attorney joining us?
- She waived her rights.
- Did I miss something?
- I told them you'd come alone.
- Why did you waive your rights?
- What did you tell them?
- That you wouldn't want to hide.
- I have nothing to hide.
No smoking in this building.
Are you going to charge me
with smoking?
What was the nature
of your relationship with Mr. Boz?
I had sex with him for about
a year and a half. I liked it.
He wasn't afraid of experimenting.
I like men like that.
Men who give me pleasure.
He gave me a lot of pleasure.
Did you ever engage
in any sadomasochistic activity?
Exactly what did you have in mind?
- Did you ever tie him up?
- No.
Johnny liked to use his hands.
I like hands and fingers.
You describe a white silk scarf
in your book.
I like white silk scarves.
They're good for all occasions.
- But you like men to use their hands.
- No, I liked Johnny to use his hands.
I don't make any rules, Nick.
I go with the flow.
Did you kill Mr. Boz?
Would I kill someone in the way
I'd described it in my book?
I'd be announcing myself
as the killer. I'm not stupid.
- We know that.
- The book gives you an alibi.
Yes, it does, doesn't it?
The answer's no.
I didn't kill him.
- Do you use drugs?
- Sometimes.
- Did you with Mr. Boz?
- Sure.
- What kind of drugs?
- Cocaine.
Have you ever fucked
on cocaine, Nick?
It's nice.
- You like playing games.
- I have a degree in psychology.
- Games are fun.
- What about boxing? Is that fun?
Is that relevant?
- Boxing was fun, till Manny died.
- How did you feel when he died?
- I loved him. It hurt.
- What about when Johnny Boz died?
I felt like someone had read my book
and was playing a game.
- You were only fucking him.
- You still get the pleasure.
Didn't you cheat on your wife?
- You knew he was married?
- I was guessing. So what?
Cigarette, Nick?
- Do you two know each other?
- No.
- How did you meet Mr. Boz?
- I needed a character for my book.
I went down to his club. I picked
him up, and then I had sex with him.
- You didn't feel anything for him?
- Not in the beginning.
Then I got to like what he did for me.
- That's pretty cold.
- I use people for what I write.
Let the world beware.
Do you want me
to take a lie-detector test?
Wait here, please.
No blips, no variations.
Either she's telling the truth,
or I've never seen anyone like her.
I guess that settles it.
- She's lying.
- You cannot fool the machine.
- Trust me. It can be done.
- What makes you an expert?
I know people that have done it.
Thanks for coming in.
- Can someone give me a ride home?
- Sure.
Want to get a drink?
- Rough day?
- Not really.
Beating that machine can't be easy.
If I was guilty and I wanted to beat
that machine, it wouldn't be hard.
It wouldn't be hard at all.
You took a lie-detector test after you
shot those two people, didn't you?
I passed.
You see?
We're both innocent, Nick.
- You know an awful lot about me.
- You know a lot about me.
I don't know anything
that's not police business.
You know I don't wear
any underwear, don't you?
Thanks for the ride.
"Nick, you want a cigarette?"
"Nick, can I have a ride?â
- She didn't ask me directly.
- And you volunteered.
- Nick, Evian?
- No, a double Black Jack.
- What are you doing?
- I've been dry for three months.
Is that all right with you, cowboy?
She doesn't know me.
I've never seen her before.
- You're sure?
- Yes.
Cheers.
- Now what?
- Now nothing. She passed the test.
- She knew how to beat it.
- What is it with you and this broad?
What about her parents?
Has she published any other books?
Her parents died in an accident.
What are you now, a book critic?
How did they die?
Was there an investigation?
So she killed her parents?
Did she kill Manny Vasquez, too?
Not unless she climbed into the ring,
and turned into one mean bastard.
Maybe she grew an afro and put
shoe polish all over her face.
Let's polygraph her again.
Fuck you, Nick.
- Don't worry, Nick will fuck himself.
- You guys are very funny.
- Chucky, get me another double.
- Back on the Black Jack, Shooter?
- We're discussing a case here.
- No doubt.
There you go, Nick.
A double, Shooter?
I'm off duty, Nilsen.
I'm off duty discussing a case.
That's not an I.A. problem.
Maybe I should put in
for some overtime.
Don't work too hard, Shooter.
It might drive you to drink.
Stop riding me, man.
I'll kick your fucking teeth in.
- What's the problem?
- No problem, Doctor.
Here comes the shrink, in time
to save her favourite patient.
Fuck off, Marty.
You kids have a good time tonight.
- He's asking for it.
- Right, don't take the bait.
You want to go?
Yes.
Is he banging her just to get
off the hook with Internal Affairs?
He ain't that way.
He's got a heart.
Stop. No.
What was she like?
Catherine Tramell?
You had her pegged.
She used her book as an alibi.
I met her at Berkeley.
- We took the same classes.
- Why didn't you tell me?
I'm telling you.
- You're not usually like this. Why?
- You tell me. You're the shrink.
You weren't making love to me.
You weren't making love.
- I need a cigarette.
- You said you quit.
The top drawer in the foyer.
Get it on your way out.
- They're waiting on you.
- You look like dog shit.
- He's a little shrunk, that's all
- Not just in the head.
I called Berkeley.
There was a murder in '80.
A professor, in his bed, multiple
stab wounds with an ice pick.
- Tramell was there then.
- The records say she was.
Gus, get out to Berkeley. Harrigan,
find out what else she's published.
Look into the parents' accident.
Get psychological input from Beth.
- What about me?
- You're getting psychological input.
Go soak your head
in a tub of ice water.
Nick
You see where she leads.
Have you nothing better to do than
come in and jack off the machine?
- Why are you here?
- I'm here to jack off the machine.
One dead psychology professor.
Dr. Noah Goldstein.
Guess what?
He was her counsellor.
- Was she a suspect?
- No, never even gave a statement.
- Hazel Dobkins!
- You know her?
How could I ever forget?
Good housewife, three little kids.
Nice husband, faithful,
no financial problems.
One day, out of the clear blue sky,
she does them. All of them.
With a knife she got
for a wedding present.
Didn't even deny it.
Said she didn't know why she did it.
- Hi.
- Am I disturbing you?
No, come on in.
Let's go upstairs.
I'm using you for my book.
You don't mind, do you?
- Do you want a drink?
- No, thanks.
That's right,
you're off the Jack Daniel's.
- I've got a few questions.
- I have some for you, too.
- What's wrong with ice cubes?
- I like rough edges.
What did you want to ask me?
How does it feel to kill someone?
You tell me.
I don't know, but you do.
It was an accident.
They got in the line of fire.
Four shootings in five years,
all accidents?
They were drug buys.
I was working undercover.
You want to tell me
about Professor Goldstein?
- There's a name from the past.
- What about Hazel Dobkins?
Noah Goldstein was my counsellor.
That's where I got the idea
for the ice pick for my book.
- Funny how the subconscious works.
- Hilarious.
- Hazel is my friend.
- She took out her whole family.
Yes, she helped me understand
homicidal impulse.
- Didn't you learn that at school?
- Only in theory.
But you know all about homicidal
impulse, don't you Shooter?
Not in theory, in practice.
What happened?
Did you get sucked into it?
Did you like it too much?
I don't know
what you're talking about.
Tell me about the coke.
The day you shot those tourists,
how much coke did you do?
You can tell me.
- I didn't
- Yes, you did.
They never tested you, did they?
Internal Affairs knew.
Your wife knew it too, didn't she?
She knew what was going on.
Nicky got too close to the flame.
Nicky liked it.
That's why she killed herself.
Hi, honey.
You two have met, haven't you?
You're going to make
a terrific character, Nick.
She's on the phone.
I'll give you a call back.
Who has access to my file?
Who's seen my goddamn file?
Nobody. It's a confidential
psychiatric record.
Don't you fucking lie to me.
Was it Internal Affairs?
No, Nick. It's Nilsen.
- What do you want?
- You sold her my file.
- Who are you talking about?
- Tramell. What did she pay you?
Stop it.
How much?
Back off, Curran.
Nice and easy now.
You fucked yourself, Shooter.
You are out.
- You are out.
- Save it.
- Nick, what's going down?
- Nothing. I'm okay.
- They're after your badge.
- I'm tired of being played with.
She knows where I live and breathe.
- She's coming after me, Gus.
- What is it you've got between you?
- I don't know.
- Something though.
Something Yeah.
Nick? Are you there?
Go away, Beth.
I don't want to see you.
I still have my key.
Put it on the table and leave.
- Put it on the table and leave.
- You owe me more than that.
I don't owe you anything
and you don't owe me anything.
We slept together. Nothing memorable
enough to carry an obligation.
Sometimes I really hate you.
Get yourself a friendly little
therapist and work out the hostility.
Then maybe you can get off
once in a while.
Are you nuts?
Sorry.
I don't usually act like that.
- How could you give him my file?
- I had to.
He wanted you off the force.
He didn't buy my evaluation.
I made a deal with him
to review the session notes himself.
- I didn't think he'd sell them.
- You did it for me?
I care about you. I did it for you.
Go away, Beth.
Please, just go away.
I'm on my way.
One shot. Close range.
Probably a .38 calibre.
Give me your gun, Nick.
You think ...?
I don't,
but I've got the minority opinion.
Okay, I went after him.
I lost my temper.
Have you any evidence that
he showed your file to anyone?
No.
- Wait outside, Dr. Garner.
- I'd like to sit in.
I don't see anything wrong with that,
if Detective Curran doesn't object.
- Where were you last night?
- At home watching TV.
- All night?
- Yes, all night.
Were you drinking?
- Yes.
- When did you start drinking again?
- A couple of days ago.
- I saw him at 10 o'clock last night.
He was sober and lucid. I asked him
about his altercation with Nilsen.
He expressed regret
and displayed no hostility.
- How long were you there?
- About 15 minutes.
I had no reason for concern,
so I left.
There's no smoking.
Are you going to charge me
with smoking?
Christ! I'm going to ask you this
just for the record:
Did you kill Marty Nilsen?
No.
I had a fight with him that day.
Am I going to kill him that night?
- I'm not that dumb.
- That's a good alibi.
- Like writing a book about it?
- Good point.
- What book?
- Private joke, asshole.
I don't think it's funny.
You're going on leave, -
- pending the outcome
of a psychiatric evaluation.
Beth
I'll get my stuff in a minute.
Thank you.
It's the least I could do.
I screwed up with your report.
I mean it. Thank you.
How do you know
Catherine Tramell saw your file?
She knows things I'd only told you.
She must really be something.
From a clinical point of view.
- How was she at school?
- I hardly knew her. She was creepy.
I don't know why.
Get some rest.
Promise?
- I didn't mean what I said
- Yes, you did.
I'm a big girl. I can handle it.
- Take care
- Anything on the parents?
You're on psycho leave.
I'm talking to a possible whacko here.
You know I'm whacko, Sam.
What did you find out?
The boat blew. Leaky fuel line.
It had been repaired.
They both had $5 million policies.
The investigation gave zilch.
It was an accident.
L.A. are handling
the Nilsen investigation.
- Stay in touch with Dr. Garner.
- She killed them, Phil.
- Beth?
- No, Catherine Tramell.
First she steals your file,
now she's killed Nilsen?
Forget about her.
Get her the hell out of your system.
You don't buy it, do you?
She knew that.
She knew I'd say she did it.
She is screwing with your head.
Stay away from her.
I heard about what happened.
What good is a shooter
without his gun?
- How did you find out?
- I have attorneys and friends.
Money buys a lot
of attorneys and friends.
I have neither money nor attorneys,
and Gus is my only real friend.
I wasn't talking about real friends.
- Why doesn't Gus like me?
- I like you.
- You do?
- Yes.
- You want to come up for a drink?
- I didn't think you'd ask me.
I guess you don't know
your character that well.
Pretty soon I'll know you
better than you know yourself.
- Don't be so sure. I'm very
- Unpredictable?
Put some warmth into the place.
It might reflect on your personality.
I'm not trying to fool anybody.
Jack Daniel's? Ice?
Great.
I was expecting you.
K-Mart. $1.65.
Why don't you let me
do this for you?
You like watching me do it,
don't you?
Could I have a cigarette, too?
I told you you'd start again.
Light it for me, please.
How much did you pay Nilsen
for my file?
Isn't he the policeman that you shot,
Shooter?
What if I ask you
not to call me Shooter?
- How about I call you Nicky?
- My wife called me that.
I know. I like it.
- Cheers. Friends call me Catherine.
- What did Manny Vasquez call you?
Bitch mostly,
but he meant it affectionately.
Do you have any coke?
I love coke with Jack Daniel's.
- I've got a Pepsi in the fridge.
- It's not really the same thing.
No, it's not.
So where is this going?
What do you want?
Say: What do you want
from me, Catherine?
What the fuck
do you want from me, Catherine?
I brought you something.
- What's it about?
- A boy who kills his parents.
They have a plane.
He makes it look like an accident.
Why did he do that?
To see if he could get away with it.
- When did you write this?
- Was it before my parents' death?
No. I wrote it years afterwards.
Don't stop following me around
now you're on leave.
I'd miss you. But you could get in
trouble, as you're no longer a cop.
- I'll risk it.
- Why take the risk?
To see if I can get away with it.
- How's your new book?
- It's practically writing itself.
I'll be leaving about midnight,
in case you are going to follow me.
- I'll be at Johnny Boz's club.
- I'll meet you there.
Hi, Gus.
Forgive me for asking, but why
have you got your head up your ass?
If she wants to play, fine.
I can play.
- Everybody she plays with dies.
- I know what that's like.
If you don't leave her alone,
I'll kill you.
Let me ask you something, Rocky,
man to man.
I think she's
the fuck of the century.
What do you think?
How long have you been here?
You like watching, don't you?
She likes me to watch.
Nicky
Good morning.
- Roxy's not taking this too well.
- She's seen me fuck guys before.
Maybe she saw something
she's never seen before.
- She's seen everything before.
- I thought I'd seen it all before.
Was it really so special?
I told her, I thought
it was the fuck of the century.
- What do you think?
- I thought it was a good beginning.
What about Roxy? Is she more fun?
- Would you like her to join us?
- Did she join you and Johnny?
- No, Johnny felt intimidated.
- And look what happened to him.
- Were you frightened, last night?
- That's what made it so good.
- You shouldn't play this game.
- Why not? I like it.
- You're in over your head.
- This is how I'll catch my killer.
I won't confess all my secrets,
just because I have an orgasm.
You won't learn anything.
Yes, I will.
And I'll nail you.
- You'll just fall in love with me.
- I'm in love with you already.
But I'll nail you anyway.
You can put that in your book.
- I thought you'd be here.
- Where the fuck have you been?
Easy, cowboy. I wasn't home.
- I went over last night, too.
- I wasn't there then, either.
You fucked her. Goddamn!
You fucked her!
You are one dumb son-of-a-bitch!
- Next time I'll use a rubber.
- I don't give a shit about that.
- You're forgetting something. $32.
- I've got it.
- He's worried about rubbers.
- You've got to protect yourself.
You think I'm getting any?
Sure, I can get laid,
by goddamn blue-haired women.
Don't knock it till you've tried it.
- Feeling better?
- I feel fine.
- How could you fuck her?
- Gus, come on.
You want to die?
What is it, those goddamn tourists?
You feel so bad about that, you're
wiggling your way into an ice pick.
We've got too many goddamn tourists.
There's plenty more
where they came from.
- I'm not afraid of her.
- Why the hell not?
I don't know. I'm just not.
- That's her pussy talking.
- Come on, Gus.
L.A. did a track on
Martin "Dickhead" Nilsen.
They found $50,000 in a safe-deposit
box. He took it out three months ago.
She didn't know me three months ago.
Maybe it wasn't her that paid him,
and the money was for something else.
I'm just an old city cowboy
trying not to fall out of his saddle.
- Are you all right, cowboy?
- Yeah.
- I'll drive you home.
- In that little piss-ant car?
Hell no! I'm not taking
back-pain-disability retirement.
I'm going to get a full pension,
and a real gold-plate Seiko watch.
- Move over. I'm driving.
- Not in my Cadillac!
No head-up-his-ass person
is driving my Cadillac.
Bye-bye.
You want to play? Come on.
Come on.
Roxy...
- I've got the information.
- Then get it down here.
- This is your statement?
- It was an accident.
- "A car wouldn't get out of the way."
- Do you think she meant to crash?
- Can we have him now?
- No.
Don't fuck with me.
I'll put your ass in a sling.
Full name: Roxanne Hardy.
No convictions.
The car is registered
to Catherine Tramell.
- You knew her.
- I met her at Tramell's house.
You met her, and then she rolls
her car over in front of you and dies?
That's all I know.
Well, you know what?
Fuck you, Nick. Fuck you!
- I told you to stay away from her.
- Not from her car.
- Be in Garner's office at 9.
- Who will you sell my file to now?
You are out of control, Curran.
Hello, Nick.
This is Dr. Myron and Dr. McElwaine.
They've been asked to consult with me
on this psychiatric evaluation.
Sit down, Nick.
- You have a problem with your temper.
- Only in regard to one person.
Do you think
Lt. Nilsen deserved to die?
I didn't know him well enough,
but I won't miss him.
When you recollect your childhood,
are those recollections pleasing?
One: I used to jerk off.
I used to jerk off a lot.
Two: I wasn't mad when I heard
Mom and Dad in the bedroom.
Three: I don't look in the toilet
before I flush.
Four: I haven't wet my bed
for a long time.
Five: Why don't the two of you
go and fuck yourselves?
- I'm trying to help you.
- I don't need your help.
Yes, you do. Something's going on.
You're sleeping with her.
- What's your interest in her?
- My interest is in you, not her.
- She manipulates people.
- I thought you hardly knew her.
- I know the type. I'm a psychologist.
- Then you manipulate people, too.
You're a practising psychologist.
You're better at it than she is.
I feel sorry for you, Nick.
Catherine?
Catherine?
I should have known.
I came into the house,
when we'd been down on the beach.
She looked at me so strangely.
She left right after you.
I shouldn't have let her watch us.
She wanted to watch me all the time.
She tried to kill you, didn't she?
- Did you like her to watch you?
- Do you think I told her to kill you?
Everybody that I care about dies.
Make love to me.
Do you think she killed Johnny Boz?
For what? To set me up?
She loved me. She wouldn't frame me.
- Maybe she was jealous of him, too.
- No.
She never got jealous before.
She got excited.
I don't have luck with women.
There was a girl I met
when I was in college.
I slept with her once.
She started following me around
and taking my picture.
She dyed her hair.
Copied my clothes.
Lisa
Oberman.
It was awful.
I thought
you didn't make confessions.
I never did before.
Another nice girl.
- How old was she when it happened?
- 16.
Juvenile records
are sealed until they're deceased.
- What was the motive?
- She did it on impulse.
The razor just happened to be there.
That's what she said.
Help yourself to some coffee.
- I don't understand what's going on.
- It ain't that hard.
A farm girl got tired of all
the attention going to her brothers.
She fixed them, just like
old Hazel Dobkins fixed her family.
Roxy didn't use a wedding present,
she used Daddy's razor.
It sure makes you wonder
what they talked about.
Has she any friends
who aren't killers?
It must beat your everyday girl talk.
- I'm not sure she did it.
- Who are we talking about now?
Hazel did it. Roxy did it.
And the other one
The pussy on her
has just fried up your brain.
Oberman: Mark W. and Donald M.
There's no Lisa.
- Are you sure about the year?
- Tramell graduated in '83.
She said Lisa Oberman
was here at the same time.
Yeah, we have Tramell.
- But no Lisa Oberman.
- You're sure there's no mistake?
Only if you're making it.
This is Nick, I told you about him.
Nick, this is Hazel Dobkins.
You're the Shooter, aren't you?
How are you?
- Fine. May I speak to you?
- Will you wait for me in the car?
Goodbye, Shooter.
You like to hang outwith murderers.
- You know that Roxy
- Of course I knew.
I write about unusual people, and
I sometimes get involved with them.
It happened with you.
Killing isn't like smoking.
You can quit.
Got to go.
She has to be home by 6 o'clock
for "America's Most Wanted".
There was no Lisa Oberman
at Berkeley.
Are you checking up on me?
For what? I said Hoberman.
Hoberman.
Lisa Hoberman with an H.
You do?
Thank you.
- You're not supposed to be here.
- It'll only take a minute.
Bring it up.
That's Dr. Garner.
Bring up '83.
You shouldn't leave your door open.
- I didn't. What do you want?
- Tell me about Catherine.
- She told you.
- What did she tell me?
I slept with her once in school.
I was just experimenting.
It was just that one time.
She developed a fixation on me.
She styled her hair like mine.
She wore the same clothes.
Isn't that what she told you?
She said it was you.
You dyed your hair blond.
I dyed my hair.
I was a redhead for a while, too.
You knew Noah Goldstein. You saw all
the reports. You never said anything.
And what was I supposed to say?
"Hey, guys, I fucked your suspect."
I was embarrassed. It was the
only time I'd been with a woman.
She's really sick.
You know what she's doing.
She knows I went to Berkeley.
She knows I knew Noah.
She makes up this story
of someone who's obsessed with her.
She told me about a Lisa Hoberman.
She knows you'd find out.
You're a good cop.
Did she tell you casually,
make it seem irrelevant?
Did she tell you in bed?
That's what I'd do.
- Why did you change your name?
- I got married. He called me Beth.
He worked at the clinic in Salinas.
It didn't last long.
Do you really think
that I could kill someone?
I never even met Johnny Boz.
Why would I kill Nilsen?
Get that lock fixed.
She's evil. She's brilliant.
Did I scare you?
I wanted to surprise you.
- What's wrong?
- I found Lisa Hoberman.
You did? What's she doing?
You're not going to tell me.
Aren't we done playing games?
She says you've got it backwards.
She says you copied her.
And you believed her?
I had to go to the campus police
and file a report about her.
- You still think I'm a killer.
- No.
Liar.
- Who are you with?
- Homicide, San Francisco.
Here we go Kind of.
Lisa Hoberman, January 1980.
The report's not here.
Who's got it?
- Nilsen. You know him?
- Yeah. Thanks a lot.
He's had it a whole year.
So Nilsen had a report on Beth.
You don't know what was in it.
- Catherine told me what was in it.
- Is she telling the truth?
If Beth killed Boz, she wouldn't
want anybody to know about Berkeley.
Nilsen found out about it,
so she killed him.
- How did she know he'd found out?
- He probably asked her.
She'd have to be nuts. She's not
the one who hangs outwith murderers.
- Your girlfriend is
- That's her job.
- Somebody at Berkeley will know.
- I know. Catherine told me.
You're a goddamn birdbrain.
You think you can fuck like minks, -
- raise rugrats,
and live happily ever after.
How did you get in here?
- What's this?
- A second chance.
- I missed you.
- I wasn't gone long enough.
- Did you miss me?
- No.
- No?
- No.
Why don't you come over here
and tell me no?
- I've seen them before.
- You might not see them again.
My book's nearly finished,
and my detective's almost dead.
- Do I have time for a cigarette?
- Afterwards.
I've got to do some research.
I'm good at research, I'll help.
No, thanks.
- What are you researching?
- A new ending to your book.
Really? What's the twist?
The detective
falls for the wrong girl
but he doesn't die.
What happens to them?
They fuck like minks,
raise rugrats, -
- and live happily ever after.
It won't sell.
- Why not?
- Somebody has to die.
Why?
Somebody always does.
- I'm looking for Dr. Garner.
- She's up in San Francisco.
- I'm looking for her husband.
- Dr. Joseph Garner?
- Yeah. You know him?
- He died about six years ago.
- How did he die?
- He was shot.
Thank you.
He was walking home from work,
and someone drove by and shot him.
- What was the weapon?
- A .38 revolver. Unrecovered.
- Any suspects?
- No suspects. No motive. Unsolved.
Was his wife ever a suspect?
One of your guys was down here
a year ago, asking the same thing.
- What the hell is going on?
- Routine.
That's exactly
what the other guy said: Routine.
- What was the other guy's name?
- I can't say I remember.
Nilsen?
Yeah, that was it.
- Was she ever a suspect?
- No.
There was some talk,
but it never panned out.
- What kind of talk?
- A girlfriend.
- He had a girlfriend?
- No.
She did.
But like I said,
it never panned out.
- Thank you.
- I hope I helped you out.
Yeah, you sure did.
Catherine?
Hi, I missed you.
- I finished my research.
- I finished my book.
How does it end?
I told you.
She kills him.
Goodbye, Nick.
- Goodbye?
- Yeah. I finished my book.
Didn't you hear me?
Your character's dead.
Goodbye.
What do you want, flowers?
I'll send you an autographed copy.
Is this some kind of joke?
- Are you playing a game?
- The games are over.
You were right. It was the fuck
of the century Shooter.
Catherine?
I'll be right there.
Catherine Tramell's roommate called.
She's over in Oakland.
I've been on the phone all day.
She heard I was trying to reach her.
She says she knows all about
Catherine and Lisa Hoberman.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
And Johnny Boz's psychiatrist
has an office on Van Ness.
Guess who shares the same space?
Dr. Elizabeth Garner.
What the hell's the matter with you?
I'll be in suite 405.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going with you.
You're on leave.
It won't take long.
Gus!
Gus?
Freeze!
- What are you doing here?
- Put your fucking hands up!
I got a message to meet Gus here.
Where is he?
I know about your husband.
Do you still like girls, Beth?
- What?
- Take your hand out of your pocket.
- What's wrong with you?
- Take it out.
I loved you.
What makes you think
she had a gun?
What was she doing here?
What was Gus doing here?
Nick?
Lieutenant.
One of ours.
Jesus.
Check Beth's apartment.
A .38-calibre revolver,
behind some books.
Have ballistics check it for Nilsen.
You'd better come in here.
I guess that's it.
- It's her size.
- She must have dumped this stuff.
There's no suite 405. Tramell's
roommate died of leukaemia.
What about Salinas?
Hold on Jack.
- Did you check Nilsen's office?
- Nothing from Berkeley or Salinas.
I'm back Great.
The .38 we found
was the one used on Nilsen.
They'll check it with Salinas.
The ice pick was the same model.
We checked the tape machines
here and at Garner's office.
There's no message from Gus
on any of them.
Boz's psychiatrist said Garner
met Boz at a party at his house.
You just can't tell about people.
Even the ones you think you know
inside and out.
Congratulations, Curran.
I heard about what happened.
On TV.
<i>L---</i>
I can't allow myself
to care about you.
I can't allow myself to care.
I don't want to do this.
I lose everybody.
I don't want to lose you.
I don't want to lose you.
What do we do now, Nick?
Fuck like minks, -
- raise rugrats,
and live happily ever after.
I hate rugrats.
Fuck like minks,
forget the rugrats, -
- and live happily ever after.
