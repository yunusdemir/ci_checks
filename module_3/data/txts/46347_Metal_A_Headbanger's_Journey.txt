Heavy metal rules. All that punk shit sucks.
It doesn't belong in this world.
It belongs on fucking Mars, man.
Madonna can go to hell,
as far as I'm concerned. She's a dick.
Seriously, heavy metal... Oh, fuck!
Heavy metal definitely rules.
In 1986,
something strange happened.
Heavy metal became
the most popular music in the world
and kids everywhere
were growing their hair long,
flashing the devil-horn sign
and playing air guitar.
But not everyone loved it.
Critics thought it was unsophisticated
music for unsophisticated people.
One writer went as far as calling it
"sick, repulsive, horrible and dangerous".
Tipper Gore,
wife of America's future vice-president,
led parents in a charge
to censor heavy metal,
resulting in the now-familiar
warning labels.
Cole Porter's
"The birds do it, the bees do it"
can hardly be compared with
W. A. S. P. 's "I F-U-C-K like a beast".
I would tell you it's outrageous filth.
Religious groups launched
their own crusade against heavy metal.
They feared it was a vessel for the devil
and had created a satanic epidemic
among teenagers.
The lyrics is what's become serious
because it glorifies,
glamourises and packages evil.
And then the lawsuits came.
Metal artists were sued for causing kids
to commit suicide or even murder.
Heavy metal was the moral panic
of the day.
And metal fans?
They were considered lowlifes.
Dead-end kids. The bane of society.
How do I know all of this?
'Cause I was one of them.
My name is Sam Dunn
and this is me in 1986.
Banger. Rocker. Skid.
Call me what you want.
I'm a metalhead and I'm proud.
I grew up in Victoria, BC,
otherwise known as the land
of the newlywed and the nearly dead.
A quaint town on Canada's western edge.
The last place on Earth you'd ever expect
someone to find metal.
But I did, and I entered a whole new world.
<i></i>
Iron Maiden, Motley Crue, Van Halen.
This was the metal
that I first fell in love with.
<i>I listened to Number of the Beast
25 times in one day</i>
while doing air-guitar leaps
off my front porch.
<i>I so wanted to be in Iron Maiden.</i>
But by age 13 I needed something...
well... a little heavier.
<i></i>
<i>§ Terrorist confrontation</i>
<i>§ Waiting for the end
Wartime conspiracy §</i>
I discovered extreme metal.
<i>Beneath the Remains, Altars of Madness,
Pleasure to Kill. </i>
These were some of the fastest
and most brutal albums that I could find.
<i>Soon I was playing in my own metal band,
hosting my own radio show, Overkill, </i>
and going to every extreme metal gig
that came to town.
At 19 I went to university,
and since Metal Studies
wasn't on the curriculum,
I decided to major in anthropology.
Anthropology is the study
of human cultures,
and I loved it because I got to explore
societies vastly different than my own.
For my graduate degree,
I travelled to Central America
and wrote my thesis on the struggles
of Guatemalan refugees.
There's always been one culture
I've really wanted to study.
Heavy metal.
This music has millions
of passionate fans worldwide,
yet for 35 years
it's been consistently stereotyped,
dismissed and condemned.
I know. I've been defending it
since I was 12 years old.
Why has metal provoked
such polar reactions?
I need to answer this question.
So, this is my journey.
I'm going to take you
into the world of heavy metal.

<i></i>
<i></i>
Before I get into
how metal has divided people,
I want to explore a subject
that has long divided metalheads.
Who gets to be called
the first heavy-metal band?
This debate has been going on
for decades.
So, this seems like the best place
to start my journey.

If you wanna go back to the early metal
bands, you have to look at Blue Cheer.
Nobody talks about them very often,
but at one point they were the loudest,
most metallic trio going.
<i>Heavy metal is, of course,
in the lyrics of Born To Be Wild, </i>
which was written by a Canadian,
Dennis Edmonton, Mars Bonfire.
He was really talking about
that whole experience of...
you know, big bikes
and roaring down the highway...
For me, my awareness of it
came with Led Zeppelin.
As soon as those guys launched, people
started using the term "heavy metal".
I knew instantly that that sound
was heavy something.
As it is today, probably Deep Purple...
you know, 'cause they were the first
to have this great big fuck-off PA...
and, erm... the first to have
a lot of pyrotechnics.
Actually, the first time "heavy metal"
was ever used...
was used... about Alice Cooper.
<i>In Rolling Stone magazine.</i>
<i>Rolling Stone was doing an interview with
us in '71, '72, '73, something like that.</i>
There was a photo of a guy holding me up
and it said, "Da-da-da...
It's 'heavy metal'. "
Every metal band owes a debt, musically,
to Black Sabbath. They were the original.
Indeed. First metal band ever.
Black Sabbath.
Every cool riff has already been written
by Black Sabbath.
Anything anyone else does
is just basically ripping it off.
Either you're playing it slightly different,
or fast or slow, but...
They did everything already.
For my money, Black Sabbath
reigns as the first heavy-metal band.
It was here on the gritty streets
of Birmingham, England, in 1970,
where Sabbath took music to a darker...
more sinister place.
Most people associate Black Sabbath
with Ozzy Osbourne,
now known as a reality-TV dad,
but it was Tony lommi, Sabbath's guitarist,
who was responsible
for creating the band's sound
and the first true heavy-metal riffs.
When I first heard of "heavy metal"
I had no idea what it was.
This was many years ago.
I was doing an interview and somebody
said, "About this heavy metal... "
"What's that?"
I just came up with a sort of music
that everybody liked
when we first started writing riffs.
And then Black Sabbath... And
Black Sabbath seemed so different.
Those few notes, you know,
that sort of said it all.
I thought, "God, this is great!"
We loved it. We loved the vibe.
You know, hairs come up on your arm.
It just gave us a great feeling of...
"This is what we're about!"
The sound being, you know, demonic,
it sort of... It just appealed to us.
It appealed to the...
We liked what we were doing.
We liked the idea of those...
evilly-sounding riffs.
<i></i>
Since Black Sabbath,
the sound of evil has become
a defining element of metal.
But what makes metal sound evil?
The blues scale has the flat fifth,
the tritone. That's the devil's note.
In the old days,
you weren't allowed to use that note.
<i>But Black Sabbath,  their title song...</i>
<i>Black Sabbath is totally working
the diminished fifth. The tritone.</i>
In the Middle Ages, the tritone
was identified as the music of the devil
because it...
apparently was the sound
one used to call up the Beast.
There's something very sexual
about the sound of the tritone.
I think that in the Middle Ages,
people who were ignorant and scared,
when they heard that,
and felt that reaction,
went, "Oh, here comes the devil!"
There's an ongoing battle in metal
to be more evil than the band before you.
This has kept me into metal
all these years.
But there's more to metal
than just sounding evil.
If you don't have an electric guitar
with really good amps,
and really good distortion,
you don't have the core of metal.
You also need to have
a really strong bass sound in it.
Bass with the bass guitarist
and bass with the bass drums.
And then usually a vocalist who soared
over top of all of that stuff,
with usually a fairly high voice.
They can't be soft, cute, sly.
Um... they have to be leather-lunged
in one way or another.

When I was a kid, practising
air-guitar leaps off my front porch,
my band of choice was Iron Maiden.
I memorised every note, every riff,
and every solo.
Maiden was part of the new wave
of British heavy metal,
a movement that built on the foundation
laid by early metal bands.
They honed a sound
that was faster, heavier
and more melodic
than their predecessors'.
I'm about to interview Maiden's
legendary singer Bruce Dickinson,
and if the 12-year-old Sam
knew about this, he'd be freaking out.
But I've got to keep it together,
even though I'm interviewing him
- at London's Hammersmith Odeon.
- I'd better start talking, then.
My intention as a front man
is to try and find the guy who's right
at the back of the 30,000 festival
and sort of go, "Yeah, you!"
"Yeah, you! You!"
And the guy goes, "Me?"
Like that. And you can do that.
You can actually do that.
<i>§ Run to the hills</i>
<i>§ Run for your lives</i>
<i>§ Run to the hills</i>
<i>§ Run for your lives</i>
<i>The mike's there, but you've got to sound
like you're projecting to the back of the hall.</i>
Like there's a tremendous effort involved.
And so you get the return, in people
like Bruce Dickinson in particular,
or Rob Halford of Judas Priest,
of this very operatic style
of vocal production,
that was developed in the 19th century,
before amplification,
in order to reach the back of the hall.
You're warming up the whole crowd,
and on a good night, when it all works,
it shrinks... whatever arena you're in
and it should, by the end of the...
Me in particular, 'cause
I'm the guy yelling at everybody.
It should feel like you've shrunk the place
to the size of your thumb,
where you can go, "Yeah... altogether. "
Goodnight!
Dickinson's operatic vocal style
has had an enormous impact
on heavy metal music,
and although metal isn't associated
with virtuosic styles of music,
like classical or opera, it's these
influences that make metal unique.
The classical roots of heavy metal
are fairly obvious.
I would say most of the practitioners,
most of the really good ones,
were fans of dark classical music.
And in some cases dark, powerful,
heavy classical music, like Wagner.
He actually reshaped the orchestra.
He added tubas, he added extra basses,
he added an octobass,
which is actually a double-sized
bass violin
that two people can play,
one guy on a stool fingering it,
and one guy, you know, playing the bow.
He just loaded down the bottom end
of his orchestra,
so that when that orchestra played
the rafters shook, there was so much bass.
That hadn't been heard live before.
If Richard Wagner had actually
been around today
he'd probably be in Deep Purple.
Or Beethoven would've been happy
to be in Led Zeppelin.
<i></i>
And the music itself,
because it was so huge,
and there was no amplification then,
they had orchestration,
again belongs to that metal environment.
Classical music is associated
with the university and learning.
Bach and Mozart didn't go to college.
Virtuosic performers
who were known as improvisers.
That describes Bach
as well as it describes Eddie Van Halen.
<i></i>
From Eddie Van Halen on,
the guitar becomes so overdriven, so hot,
that the models of playing for the violin
and organ become relevant to the guitar,
which used to be like piano,
where you'd hit a note and it would fade.
Not any longer. A note couldn't last forever
because it's feeding back.
Suddenly, you have the classical models
being relevant
because of technological changes.
<i></i>
Of course, heavy metal
has another musical ancestor.
One whose roots lie deep
in the American South.
The root of all rock and roll is...
is in blues and slave music.
I mean, they invented... The guitar is an
African instrument. That's where it started.
The origins of metal really can trace itself
back to the blues. In America.
And that was very much
an oppressed music.
It spoke to people that needed
something a little different.
It was about the worker
coming out of the factory
wanting the energy to come out
in a different way,
in an entertainment form
that was theirs and theirs alone.
How were you influenced
by the blues?
A lot. I liked the blues.
That's where we started.
Before we called ourselves Black Sabbath,
we were a blues/jazz band.
Our first influence
was really American blues
that had been processed through the
sensibilities of the English rock musician.
They took American blues
and threw it back at us.
<i>§ Well, they call me the working man</i>
<i>§ I guess that's what I am</i>
<i>§ They call me the working man</i>
<i>§ I guess that's what I am §</i>
If you look at the history of Black Sabbath,
Deep Purple, and Led Zeppelin,
they weren't from affluent backgrounds,
so they knew how to present their music
to people from a like-minded situation.
Describe Aston to me.
A shit-hole, basically. Erm...
Very rough, very... Not a good area.
Some of the people were nice.
- It just... got run down, you know.
- Mm.
And I hated it, living there. I hated it.
-  Mm.
- At first. I moved there with my parents.
And I think that influenced our music,
as far as where we come from,
and the area we were from
made it sort of more mean.
The place where we're from,
there's a lot of big factories over there.
Like heavy metal factories.
They're all there, you know.
So, they're like aluminium and... steel, too.
And you can see the impact
around the environment.
And also on the people too, you know.
Places shut down
and some of the places built up.
You can see a lot of things on people
and it's not always nice.
The thing to do in the evenings was
to go and hang out around the phone box.
'Cause that was the only light source
in the whole village.
And it was in the middle, so we used to
hang around and swap dirty stories.
If there was any luckless women
walking past, you know...
it was just fucking hopeless.
But that's like any small town
in any nation.
It comes from growing up
in a place like Des Moines.
More people grow up in places like that
than you'll ever, ever imagine.
I mean the disaffected.
It's a... it's a place where
churches outnumber everything.
You grow up in the cemetery because it's
the only place that has anything to do.
It's a place where your friends would rather
kill themselves than use their imagination.
There's nothing, so you have to grow
this whole other world in your head.
That really makes for strong personalities
and that's why a lot of people from lowa
are probably the sickest I've ever seen.
On Saturday night... erm...
- You know, you hear guns.
-  "Pow! Pow! Pow!"
You just hear 'em and...
It's not even really a "What's that?
Was that a gun?"
It's like "They're shooting again.
It's Saturday night. "
So, that inevitably becomes
part of what Lamb of God is about.
- It becomes part of the landscape.
- It becomes part of your psyche.
Kids are bored, agitated, erm...
you know, especially if they have
problems at home.
Parents, drug addiction, alcoholism.
It all contributes to a...
you know, the product
of a young, angry musician.
It's a negation of the world
as it's handed to you.
It just says, to this daily existence
of this boring-ass high school
or this dead-end Dairy Queen job,
"Just no! This is something that's mine,
and that I own, and fuck you.
"I won't do what you tell me. "
<i>§ Fuck you, I won't do what you tell me</i>
<i>§ Fuck you, I won't do what you tell me</i>
<i>§ Fuck you, I won't do what you tell me</i>
<i>§ Fuck you, I won't do what you tell me</i>
<i>§ Fuck you, I won't do what you tell me</i>
<i>§ Fuck you, I won't do what you tell me</i>
<i>§ Fuck you, I won't do what you tell me</i>
<i>§ Motherfucker/</i>
<i>§ Ughh/ Ughh/ Ughh/</i>
I'm 13 years old, 14 on Halloween,
which I'm proud of,
and I grew up in a small town in Quebec
where everyone likes Shania Twain
and Avril Lavigne, so...
I've changed in the last couple of years.
They were like "What happened to you?"
- Satan has arrived.
-  Is it a statement for you?
Yeah. There is a statement in it.
It's "Fuck you!"
A lot of people in my town
would rather I wear jeans or whatever.
Wal-Mart stuff. But I choose not to and
people are gonna have to deal with that.
Metalheads, a lot of them,
if you do say something to them,
they have their own opinions
and they can talk to you about it.
Don't try to like the same music
because your friend likes it.
Don't try to listen
to whatever's popular so you'll fit in.
You find self-confidence in metal
'cause it's a strong type of music
that gives you the ability to say
"OK, screw you!
"I like this band. If you don't like it,
don't listen to it. "
My name's Joe Bottiglieri.
I'm, er... 34 years old.
I was born in White Plains, New York.
I'm an ex-Marine.
Once a Marine, always a Marine.
I'm now a director of technology
for a firm in New York City
and I'm a diehard metal fan.
It was there
for a lot of dark times in my life.
From the time I was 12 years old,
metal was a constant
and a lot of the lyrics spoke to me
on a personal level
about sticking to your guns
and staying true to what you believe in.
It's like a lifestyle music.
Everything else is like "I like it,
I like it for a week, I lose interest",
but metal fans love it forever.
I'm not a casual person.
When I like something, it's real
and it's not casual music.
Like no one goes "Yeah,
I was really big into Slayer. One summer. "
I never met that guy.
I've only met the guy with Slayer
carved on his chest.
No main veins. That's good.
No arterial spray.
If you listen to, like, the Replacements
or the Smiths when you're young,
it sort of says that you feel weird and
different, but that's 'cause you're smart.
You are different
but you should be happy with that.
But metal seemed to tell people
that you feel weird but you're not.
That's why I was so interested
in the idea of the Kiss Army.
It was this idea that if you liked Kiss,
that means that you're part
of this massive coven of people
who have, like, the same values you have.
Kiss songs always seem to imply
that as Kiss fans
we're being somewhat persecuted for it.
<i>Like if you listen to Crazy Nights</i>
it somehow implies people are trying
to stop us from liking Kiss!
I think that's a really brilliant idea.
That's part of the draw to metal.
It makes people feel like...
it's not a way to understand
your loneliness.
It's a way to feel a part of something
larger than yourself,
because everything about metal
is larger than life.
It gives them an alternative universe.
It gives them a life of imagination
through which they can view music.
It usually inspires a lot of them
to pick up a guitar and start playing.
I'm Eric Bryan. I'm 17.
I'm from Riverside, California.
I'm a bass player.
-  You're also a student?
- Yeah.
- Metal does something for you.
- Yeah.
- What do you think that is?
- I couldn't get into other styles.
No matter how much I listened to it,
rap wasn't doing anything for me.
I can relate to metal,
maybe because it's a little more angry.
Something that you have to dig into
to define has always interested me.
Some things you scratch the surface
and there it is,
but with metal
there's so many meanings to it.
Whether they be religious or just in life,
there's something for everyone.
Why is music so important to you?
It's something that I can always count on.
Things in life, they tend to...
It's a roller-coaster,
so sometimes things are good or bad.
Whether you've had a good day
or a bad day
the music's gonna be there,
and that's been very important.
It really gets inside
the mind of an eternal 15-year-old.
If you ever lose that 15-year-old kid
inside of you,
then it won't make any sense at all
and people will start saying,
"That was the part of my life
I'm really embarrassed about now.
"I wore those stupid trousers
and had that long hair. "
People are somehow ashamed of what
they were like when they were a kid.
I still have people asking me nowadays,
"Aren't you ever going to
outgrow that shit?"
I'm like "Fuck you!" I wear these shirts
'cause I like them, not because it's popular.
I'm who I am and if...
<i>if that makes me a fuckin' dork
or I'm not GQ or I'm not in vogue</i>
I really couldn't fuckin' give two shits.
It's outsider music and subjects and
as a kid I was an outsider and the loner
and I think that...
that's where it all begins.
You don't care about baseball,
you're obsessed with the Manson Family.
Not 'cause it's cool,
'cause it doesn't appear to be cool,
'cause it's making you look
like the weird kid.
Nobody wants to be the weird kid,
you just end up being him,
you can't figure out how you got there.
Metal is sort of like that, except it's like
all the weird kids in one place.
<i></i>
<i>§ If you like to gamble
I tell you I'm your man</i>
<i>§ You win some, lose some
It's all the same to me</i>
I'm on my way
to Wacken Open Air...
the Mecca of heavy-metal culture.
This is where 40,000 diehard fans descend
on a small town in northern Germany
for four days of beer,
debauchery and heavy metal.
But it's 2am, we've no passes
and none of us speak a word of German...
We're gonna stay.
We're gonna sleep. In the lot.
... but with the power of charades, we
track down the organiser Thomas Jensen.
He gives us our passes
and a bit of a hard time.
Are you fuckin' crazy or what?
In the middle of the night?
- Very long day. We lost some of our bags.
- Surprise, surprise.
These are the festival grounds.
Tomorrow, this place will come alive
with metalheads,
here to worship their metal gods.
I'm in heaven. I'm in fuckin' heaven!
<i></i>
<i>§ You know I'm born to lose
and gambling's for fools</i>
<i>§ But that's the way I like it, baby
I don't want to live forever</i>
<i>§ And don't forget the joker/</i>
... from Italy.
-  Where are you guys from?
- From Italy?
- From Italy, yeah.
<i>- Salute.
-  Salute. </i>
It's the morning of the first full day
of music at Wacken.
Already... the vast majority of fans
are totally hung-over.
Including me.
I'm looking pretty rough.
Cut me some slack here.
Wacken is about
more than just the music.
It is a veritable feast of everything metal.
Here you can find the metal market,
metal breakfast, metal karaoke...
You can even play a game
of heavy-metal foosball.
Sweet. Can I play?
-  Who's that?
-  I want Dio.
There should be, like,
black metal versus death metal.
Fans travel tens of thousands of miles
from over 20 countries to be at Wacken.
As an anthropologist, I'm here to explore
the elements that unify this group of fans.
The thing about festivals is, you
can come here and get anything you want.
Get your band shirts. Get everything.
This is the look, the image...
This is the uniform.
What makes metal a culture
is firstly the music.
No question about it. Secondly...
uniform is the wrong word,
but the way you dress.
Dressing a certain way
marks you immediately as a metal fan.
Black is really important.
Leather is really important.
Silver is good, you know, in studs.
It's not real silver, it's nickel.
Black in Western culture
is a very interesting thing.
It means danger, it means evil.
It also means freedom.
Outside of the light of day,
where people are not watching you.
The kids who liked metal
looked like they do.
Everyone had long hair,
wore black, and had tattoos.
It was just fun.
It was like... an army of kids.
Metal is unified by
much more than the way the fans dress.
Because mainstream support
has come and gone over the past 35 years,
metal is kept alive by
a dedicated core of fans.
They are the ones who publish magazines,
programme college radio shows,
run independent record labels
and host news sites and chatrooms
on the internet.
The underground
is just a network of friends.
Just everyone who's participating.
Other people help printing up T-shirts,
another one is driving.
Another kid is helping out his friends
by helping them load and unload the van.
Sell the T-shirt. It's a community.
Yeah? You know Goddess of Desire?
We have three CDs out.
Also on vinyl, of course. True metal.
Metal, for me, is a brotherhood.
I think that's what keeps it alive.
We pass it on to
our younger brothers, to our friends.
This is a way of life. When I wake up,
I've got Slayer on the stereo.
Some people wake up, read a paper, drink
coffee. I listen to Slayer and Testament.
It's... it's... it's in your blood.
It's the air that you breathe.
It's a sub-strata of society,
because what attracts heavy-metal fans
to themselves is a tribal attitude.
It's "Let's go to a festival
and enjoy ourselves. "
The fact that the outside world
doesn't understand is fantastic.
Another thing that I love
is that it's so fucking huge,
yet it's like certain people
don't even know it exists.
That was amazing!
They're one of my favourite bands.
To see them in front of 40,000 people
was a dream come true.
-  Was it?
- Best show I've ever seen. I was in the pit.
That was fucking awesome.
That was fucking awesome.
Wacken hosts
a wide range of metal bands.
For the outsider, it's hard to understand
how they all fall under the same umbrella.
Even for the diehard metal fan
this gets complex,
so you might wanna take notes.
The early metal bands, along with
hard rock, shock rock and punk,
gave birth to an abundance of sub-genres,
each with their own distinct sound,
lyrics and look.
These are power metal,
the new wave of British heavy metal,
progressive metal, glam metal, pop metal,
stoner metal, hardcore, thrash metal,
the first wave of black metal,
Norwegian black metal,
grindcore, death metal,
Swedish death metal, metalcore, grunge,
goth metal, industrial metal,
hard alternative, new metal
and the new wave of American metal.
But don't worry.
I'm at Wacken to focus on the fans.
Not to meet with bands
from every metal sub-genre.
There are a couple of bands
that I can't resist the opportunity to meet.
<i>- We're at the gate.
-  Our interview's with Mayhem. </i>
<i>We're by the beer tents. Meet us there. </i>
My first interview is with
the Norwegian black metal band Mayhem,
the most controversial group
in the metal underground.
The band's former vocalist
blew his own brains out with a shotgun
and then his bandmates
made necklaces from pieces of his skull.
Warning: This interview gets a little weird.
The History of Metal. Mark it.
We are pretty true to ourself.
We never bargain with our stuff, you know.
We just release it.
If people don't like it, then fuck them!
That's why we are here.
Germany sucks for us!
We are here to make,
you know, a statement,
saying "Yeah, Mayhem, we rule. We are
the fucking best metal band out there. "
If people don't recognise it, fuck them!
<i>
We never negotiate, or come to terms.</i>
Fuck you! You know what I mean?
- Can you repeat the question?
-  People say...
- What?
... that black metal is losing touch...
- Who?
... with its roots.
Which one?
Who the fuck are you talking to?
Fuck them, you know!
- Any comments about that?
- Fuck that.
Yeah, I have a comment.
Fuck you! You know.
Beer and interviews?
Not a good combination.
But I know one guy who can deliver
is Ronnie James Dio.
He's the godfather of power metal,
metal's most over-the-top
and fantastical sub-genre.
Think swords, sorcery,
chivalry and Dungeons & Dragons,
and you've got power metal.
One thing Ronnie is known for
is inventing the devil horns,
the most enduring symbol
of heavy metal culture.
I'm of Italian extraction and, um...
my grandparents on both sides,
both my mother's and father's sides,
came to America from Italy,
and they had superstitions.
When I was a kid, my grandmother would
hold my hand, walking down the street,
and she would see someone
and go... "What's that?"
It was called the meloik,
someone was giving us the evil eye,
so she was giving us protection against it.
Or you could give someone
the evil eye, too.
So, invent it? No. But perfect it
and make it important? Yes.
I did it so much, especially within the
confines of that great band the Sabbath,
and you add that to what people think it is.
But because I'm lucky enough
to have done it so much,
it's been more equated with me
than anyone else.
Gene Simmons says he invented it,
but then again, Gene invented breathing,
and shoes and everything, you know.
What makes metal unique?
What makes the fans and the
culture of metal unique, do you think?
More than anything, the fact that
it becomes a great big family of people
who all share one thing,
and that is metal.
We just love it, and it's really
them against the world.
It really is, and I think that's... that's
its importance and why it lasts so long.
Thanks, guys.
Thanks, Ronnie. That was great.

<i>§ If you squeeze my lizard</i>
<i>§ I'll put my snake on you</i>
<i>§ I'm a romantic adventure</i>
<i>§ And you're a reptile too</i>
It's clear that heavy metal
shares something with all cultures:
A sense of belonging to a way of life.
Now that I've explored the roots of metal
and what it means to its fans,
it's time to find out why it has provoked
such strong negative reactions in people.
Why has heavy metal been consistently
stereotyped, dismissed and condemned?
Is there anybody
with better lyrics than Lemmy?
His opening line on that masterpiece is
"If you squeeze my lizard".
How can you not love Lemmy?
Sam Dunn is here with us.
He's been travelling around the world
making a documentary on metal.
Welcome to New York, Sam.
You're just back from the Wacken festival.
I always wanted to check that out myself.
<i>- Is there anybody that completely...
- </i>
Your favourite interview so far?
That's hard to choose but I have to say,
probably, given my long history as a fan,
Bruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden.
We interviewed him on the stage
of the Hammersmith Odeon.
-  Wow.
- It was totally amazing.
We hear you're interviewing
Dee Snider tomorrow.
Dee's always a blast to talk to,
and always outspoken. Say hello for me.
<i></i>
<i>§ We're not gonna take it</i>
<i>§ No, we ain't gonna take it</i>
<i>§ We're not gonna take it anymore</i>
To some parents in the 1980s,
Dee Snider of Twisted Sister
was the most dangerous guy on the planet.
This was when metal met
its first organised attack.
Twisted Sister and eight other metal bands
were put on a list called the Filthy Fifteen,
because their music was deemed offensive
by the Parents' Music Resource Center.
Dee Snider was summoned
to testify before the US Congress
to defend his music and his livelihood.
<i>§ We're not gonna take it</i>
<i>§ No, we ain't gonna take it</i>
<i>§ We're not gonna take it anymore</i>
1984 was a pretty insane time
for Twisted Sister.
We were hearing bits and pieces
about this Parents' Music Resource Center
and Tipper Gore, but not really registering
because we were getting protests
and religious groups at every show.
So, just another parent group
that, you know,
was putting Twisted Sister
on a list of targets.
We have always, uh... talked about
the positive aspects of the music industry,
but the highlight has been on the excesses
that have been allowed to develop
as we have tried to focus
our concern on those excesses.
Somebody told us
that the Senate committee
was having a hearing on censorship
with the PRMC
and wanted to know
if I would come and speak.
Now, my view of it, when I heard it, was
"They want me to carry the flag into battle.
<i>"Hell, yeah! Braveheart,  baby!"</i>
<i>Braveheart wasn't even out,
but that sort of mentality. "Let's go!"</i>
I knew that they were, like everybody else,
grossly underestimating me.
I knew that they viewed me
as just another dunderheaded rocker
and they would make me look like a fool,
and I would help their cause.
They did not know that I could construct
a sentence and speak English fluently.
And I'm there in my cut-off denim,
my skin-tight jeans, my snakeskin boots,
and a little bit of eye make-up
and my big hair.
And I ain't getting dressed up for nobody.
I'm a dirtbag and I'm proud.
And I'm playing these people like,
you know...
I'm setting up these guys for the kill.
I have got my speech in my back pocket,
which I have worked on for a few weeks
and honed and refined
till it's a fricking nuclear weapon,
folded up a gazillion times, like a bad kid
bringing his homework to school.
I open it up and I'm flattening it
out on the table, really deliberate.
And they're going, "Oh, man, this is
a lamb being brought to the slaughter. "
And I start reading.
"Since I am the only person
addressing this committee today
"who has been a target of accusations
from the presumably responsible PMRC,
"I would like to speak
on a more personal note
"and show just how unfair the concept of
lyrical interpretation and judgment can be,
"and how this can amount to little more
than character assassination. "
And I am just tearing apart everything
that they have accused me of,
disproving without...
beyond a shadow of a doubt,
that everything they've accused me of
has been wrong, false,
and they are scrambling,
scrambling, scrambling.
Um...
<i>They said that Under The Blade
was about sadomasochism and bondage.</i>
It was about
my guitar player's throat operation.
It's not really a... a wild leap of
the imagination to jump to the conclusion
that that's about
something other than surgery or hospitals,
neither of which
are mentioned in the song.
No, it's not a wild jump
and I think what I said at one point
was that songs allow a person
to put their own imagination,
experiences and dreams into the lyrics.
Uh... people can interpret it many ways.
Ms Gore was looking for sadomasochism
and bondage and she found it.
Someone looking for surgical references
would have found it as well.
I said, "I can't help
that Tipper Gore's got a dirty mind",
and Al Gore just... Oh, my God,
he nearly jumped over the table.
<i>They said We're Not Gonna Take It
should be on the Filthy Fifteen for violence,</i>
and it was no more violent
than the Declaration of Independence.
The PRMC rated songs
according to violence, the occult,
sex, drugs and alcohol,
and although Snider talked about throat
operations and standing up for your rights
most metal songs deal with
much more provocative themes.
Themes like hedonism, religion,
death and sexuality.

Heavy metal has always traditionally
been male-dominated.
Fact. It was a boys' club
in that the music was very aggressive
and it wasn't particularly sympathetic
towards getting a female audience.
It wasn't deliberate, but it's the way it went.
It's very strong music sonically
and... you're supposed to be strong.
Um... you don't look terribly strong.
But you know, on... on the tour buses,
the guys work out with weights, before
they go on stage, to get their muscles.
So, strength is one of the elements.
But also, using tools very effectively
is another part of
that working-class masculine ethos.
Because so much of metal
came out of a musician's attitude.
Young men that wanted to play blistering
solos, that wanted to play real fast.
This kind of urge of teenage angst,
combined with a desire
to be a good player,
was what represented
a lot of our early audience.
And for some reason,
that seemed to be mostly young guys.
All of the anxieties that you get, uh...
you know, as a young man about gender,
for a while at least, those are gone.
It's not about how to deal with women.
There just aren't any.
So, you get this sort of heroic
male-only world
where men band together and do the job.
That's a way of thinking about gender
by not thinking about gender.
If you want to call it sexist, you
could, but you'd be missing something.
"Masculine" in Western culture
means freedom.
Um... and women are always trying
to tie them down and domesticate them.
So, that's part of the masculinity element.
Metal is probably the last bastion
of real rebellion, real masculinity,
real... real men basically getting together
and beating their chests.
It's perfectly all right for guys to go
to a metal show, take their shirts off,
swing them above their heads
and go insane,
instead of trying to be these,
like, sensitive morons, or whatever.
Yeah, I love women
and I'm... l'm totally respectful to them.
But at the same time, I'm a guy.
I like hanging out with guys
and doing dumb shit. It's that simple.
Metal is one of the few places
where you can actually embrace that.
On the surface, metal appears
to be hyper-masculine and aggressive.
But is it that straightforward?
There's another part of this culture
where the guys actually look like girls.
Who could forget glam metal?
Influenced by the shock rock bands
of the 1970s,
glam was largely responsible for making
metal the world's most popular music
during the 1980s.
So, I'm heading to its birthplace,
the Sunset Strip,
to talk with Motley Crue's lead singer,
Vince Neil,
about how the heavy metal image
transformed from leather to lace.
<i></i>
<i>§ Friday night and I need a fight</i>
<i>§ My motorcycle and a switchblade knife</i>
<i>§ Handful of grease in my hair feels right</i>
<i>§ But what I need
to make me tight are those</i>
<i>§ Girls, girls, girls</i>
<i>§ Long legs and burgundy lips</i>
<i>§ Girls, girls, girls</i>
Everybody came to LA to play.
And it was a crazy scene, you know?
I mean, Sunset Boulevard was, uh...
just packed with... with people
just dressed in... from, you know,
from punks to the new romantic to...
to heavy metal to... I mean, it had
everything. And everything in between.
Sunset Boulevard would be packed,
thousands of people.
Guys that looked like girls,
girls that looked like guys.
It was just bizarre.
We just wanted to look tough,
you know, with the leather and stuff.
And obviously, when you do
a photo session, you put make-up on.
You gotta try and look good.
It just turned out that way.
And then with the next...
the next version of Motley,
<i>Theatre of Pain,  we wanted to go
completely opposite to what we just did.</i>
- More laces and frilly stuff.
-  Uh-huh.
You know, just to get people talking.
I don't know how to explain it.
I never questioned my sexuality,
and I was up there in lingerie.
And... my wife... well, then girlfriend, she
was the one dressing me up half the time.
I was going, "OK, great. Whatever.
"Stockings... Let's do it.
It's going to get me more attention?
"Let's do it. Gonna freak people out?
Fuck, yeah. "
So, I sit down with Poison,
as a photographer at that point,
<i>and they're showing me Vogue
and Elle,  saying,</i>
"This is what we want to look like. "
On the first album cover,
that's what they got.
There were guys on the Strip
that wanted to fuck them.
It's rebellion against
what men are supposed to be like,
grabbing onto signs
that are associated with women,
make-up, long hair, clothes that are
colourful and flashy and everything.
That becomes your
hyper-masculine identity
is to look very much like a woman.
What are you going to do
if you want to rebel as a man?
You gonna get
an even more severe suit than your dad?
You can't go that direction.
But you can gender-bend.
Some fan was writing to a magazine and
talked about having the guts to be glam,
so that being feminine is the most
masculine thing that you can do.
It shows that many things
we take to be natural and unchanging,
and just the way things are,
are not just that way.
An intriguing thing
about heavy metal music
is how you've got these either
very feminine, preening, on one side,
or ultra-masculine,
cock-rocking, skin-tight,
<i>check-out-the-bulge-in-my-pants,
for an audience that was 90% male.</i>
Anyway you sliced it, there's something
homoerotic about it, and bizarre.
There's some weirdness about the whole
male viewing guys looking like women
or men being actual,
you know, very strutty and almost like...
not almost, you know,
West-Village gay leather look.
There's really...
Some doctors need to look into this.
There were fans who rejected all that
and said, "That's gay. That's not... "
Those were fans
who didn't understand what gay is.
That Rob Halford was gay
and was putting on these spectacles
in basic leather-bar,
gay clothing, you know.
With the leather and the studs.
Gay fans knew
where that was coming from.
Straight fans saw that
as straighter than anybody,
when, in fact, it was
coming right out of the club.
What would you say
if you saw Rob Halford, right now?
I'd jump his bones.
<i>Even though only 10%
of the audience may be women,</i>
it was not a big gay scene
backstage at most concerts.
Matter of fact, I never even saw one.
Rob Halford kept it hidden forever,
and I know a couple other...
gay heavy metallists
who would never show their colours.
Heavy metal rock and roll
is very masculine, you know, very hetero.
When a guy's up there in a skin-tight
pair of leather pants, humping the air,
they're not looking at it as
"Oh, man, he's shaking his dick at me. "
It's "Yeah, man. Yeah, fuck that shit.
"I wish I was him.
He must be getting laid. "
I, at the time, had never drank,
I had never done drugs,
I'd never had sex, I'd never broken the law.
As I was listening to Motley Crue,
it seemed like that was all they did.
That was the totality of their existence.
When you're with Motley, you learn
a lot about the willingness of a female,
and about how women will find themselves
in amazingly compromising positions
without... any shame.
You would have boyfriends
waiting outside the bus
while their girls were in the back, heels up.
And you were just astounded
as to how is this guy, you know...
She thinks she's going in there
for an autograph?
When she comes out and kisses him
it's not gonna taste like Doublemint!
When I was young, my bedroom
was plastered with photos of metallers
and the occasional half-dressed groupie.
I'm going to talk to the world's
most famous groupie,
<i>Pamela des Barres,
who wrote I'm With The Band, </i>
a first-hand account
of the groupie lifestyle.
This is a perspective on sexuality in
metal culture that you rarely get to hear.
What is a groupie, to you?
A groupie is a girl, usually,
who wants to hang around with groups.
That's where the word comes from.
I'm with the band, you want to hang out,
you want to be in the middle of that sound.
It makes you feel so good, so hot.
Like anything could happen.
It started with Zeppelin, I think.
I think the debauchery.
Of course, I mean, please.
I know girls Elvis had plenty of sex with.
It's been going on forever.
But the idea, of women going to extremes
to be with a guy, started with Zeppelin.
The big debate is that groupies
are perceived as being objectified,
a powerless kind of girl...
That is so lame! Because they are
exactly where they want to be.
Women who are hanging out with bands
are not dragged and coerced
into the band's bedrooms
or backstage or buses or anything.
They want to be there.
They make every effort in the world
to get where they can be with these bands.
They're doing what they want to do.
Women should be naked
backstage all the time.
<i>- I love lookin' at 'em. It's great.
- </i>
I'm not sorry for one moment of it.
You'd get done, send 'em out the back,
have them come through the front door.
Sex, drugs and rock and roll.
That's exactly the way you live.
And then finally you start realising,
"Shit, this is a job too. "
You know, it's a business.
It's not just constant partying.
When I got off the road and I was done,
it took me a long time to be able
to embrace a woman, with any integrity.
They were all pigs.
And, you know, a lot of these guys
are still headfucked about it.
A lot of guys still try to live that lifestyle
because they don't know anything else.
You become a product
of that environment and go,
"My God! What did I do?"
And then as you grow older, you go,
"If I have a daughter and
somebody does this to her, I'll kill him. "
People ask if I'd let my daughter do it.
Yes, I would.
I had fun. I had a great time.
I wouldn't change any of my experiences.
In the classic age of metal,
women didn't participate
or create it or have any power in it.
All women did was hold the boyfriend's
jacket at the corner of the pit.
They were not involved at all.
But then something happened.
<i></i>
With Girlschool,
there's a definite element of respect.
When we go on stage, people give us
a great deal of respect, which is fantastic.
But I've been in bands
before Girlschool,
with people asking me
if I'm tuning the guitar for the guitarist,
or, you know,
that sort of patronising comment.
'Cause they don't expect a female
to get up and play guitar.
That's the way it's always been.
Everybody tried to, you know...
put me a little bit more into like the...
you know, the female...
the sexy image and... But without power,
and I didn't like that and people
in the record company said,
"Get rid of the black leather.
That's number one. Be more of a girl. "
I thought, "Oh, no, no, no, no.
I can't. I can't do it. "
I don't want to do it.
I definitely want to, you know, be myself.
Talent isn't always enough...
in the eyes of the masses and the public.
You have to be attractive
and it's annoying. I mean...
-  Why?
- Ugly dudes all across the board for metal.
- Yeah, exactly.
- Across the board.
Any band you can mention,
I'll tell you they're ugly.
We took Girlschool on their first tour,
you know.
Nobody else would touch them
with a yardstick.
Even the rest of my band said,
"Oh, they're girls. "
I said, "Fuck that. They're good. "
It doesn't matter.
People would say about Kelly, "Pretty
good for a girl. " I'd say, "Better than you. "
I asked Kim and Jackie
about metal being a boys' club.
- And they agreed.
- Well...
They have as much fun on the road
as I've ever seen a guy band have.
I mean, they're disgraceful,
you know what I mean?
They'd drink you under the table.
I've no more questions.
You didn't even ask
what it's like to be an all-girl band.
- OK, what is it like?
-  Crap!
What's it like to be an all-guy band?
Women have become
much more visible in metal,
not only fronting
some of the biggest metal bands,
but also mastering
the once male-dominated technique
of extreme guttural vocals.
<i></i>
<i>§This is killing us</i>
<i>§ Fighting the truth a losing battle</i>
<i>§ We believe in nothing</i>
<i>§ Just hatred for each other</i>
<i>§ Tragic sinister serenade</i>
<i>§ Twisted melody shatters reality</i>
<i>§ Dying hopes for a better day</i>
<i>§ Fragile dreams that break away</i>
<i>§ No more, no more</i>
<i>§ This pain must end</i>
When you go on the festival
you meet lots of women nowadays
who are in the band, and so,
it's not that boys' club anymore.
I think boys are happy about that as well.
It must have been a bit boring.
Just guys, sweaty ugly guys around you.
Nowadays, it's a couple of females.
It kind of loosens it up, you know.
A lot of young girls say, "I saw you live and
it was great to see a woman pull that off.
"And I just joined a band
and I want to do that myself. "
Is having a tough persona
on stage important to you?
Yeah. Because I am tough on stage.
I feel very strong on stage,
and I want to give that to the people
in front of that stage,
that you can just have
a lot of strength and power
and give it to these people
and they take a bit of that home.
Arch Enemy!
<i>§ Yeah/</i>
<i>§ No more, no more</i>
<i>- § This pain must end §
- </i>
Thank you very much!
Being called sexist
and a boys' club is one thing,
but what about metal
being called blasphemous?
I'm going to talk
to Ronnie James Dio again.
We really hit it off at the Wacken festival
so he invited me over
to continue our conversation.
Like many metal artists, Ronnie's music
is full of religious symbolism,
yet his message is often at odds with
these religions, especially Christianity.
So, I'm curious to hear
what Ronnie has to say
about metal's religious obsession.
<i></i>
<i>§ The lover of life's not a sinner</i>
<i>§ And the ending is just the beginner</i>
<i>§ The closer you get to the meaning</i>
<i>§ Well, the sooner you'll know
that you dream evil</i>
<i>§ And it's on and on and on</i>
<i>§ Heaven and hell §</i>
Do you know if anyone
holds the patent to this?
No, I don't think anyone does.
There you go, then, pal.
I think it's time to do a Gene Simmons.
I understood that Gene had found out
that OJ, as in orange juice, had never
been patented before, so he patented it.
So, every time anyone mentions OJ - I don't
know about OJ Simpson but orange juice -
he gets some money from it.
Which seems so Gene-ish to me.
'Cause he's so brilliant at that.
He's absolutely brilliant.
I'm interested in getting
your perspective on
how religion has played a part
in the music you've made.
I was always afraid, as a kid, of the nuns,
you know, the big penguins,
that were gonna smack you in the head
with a ruler, which is what they did.
<i>Or the fact that if you do something wrong
you're going to go to hell. </i>
And, uh... you know, you're going
to suffer terribly.
And I'm, "Give me a break here.
What's going on?"
That's why for me
the world is heaven and hell.
That song is about that.
The fact that we, in my mind...
we live in heaven and we live in hell. God
and the devil are inherent in each of us
and it's our choice to make.
You can take the road to good
and take the road to bad.
If there wasn't Christianity,
we wouldn't have metal as we know it.
Religion is really crucial to it.
Most of the creators in metal,
at least in metal's first several eras,
were raised... religiously.
Many years ago
when we first started,
somebody gave us some crosses,
and said, "These will protect you",
and we never, ever went anywhere
without a cross on.
I've never been on stage
without a cross.
It's become
the symbol of the band all over.
I got 'em all over my guitar.
We got 'em on stage.
One place or another, there's a cross.
Heavy metal has, pretty much
from the dawn of the genre,
been associated with Satanism.
And while Black Sabbath sung principally
about Satan being something
to be scared of, you know,
some of this stuff could almost be
described as a Christian sentiment.
The fans, however, wanted a satanic band
and eventually commercial pressures
meant that Black Sabbath exploited
this kind of connection between them
and, uh... demonic imagery
and satanic ideas.
We got a lot of flack for it
from everybody else.
There was things said about us being devil
worshippers, and God knows what else.
One particular thing that happened,
here in Europe, was the Church, um...
really tried to stop us
from playing in this town,
whatever town it was, escapes me now,
and we didn't... They actually
did manage to stop us from playing.
They banned the show.
And the church burnt down.
Nothing to do with us.
But the church burnt down.
But, of course, then it was to do with us.
They tried to turn it... It was our fault.
I think when we used to use
crosses on stage on fire and stuff like that,
probably didn't help.
Who cannot think of Black Sabbath
without seeing one upside-down cross?
Who cannot think of Slayer
without seeing a pentagram?
You know, it's... Visually, it kind of ties
you to a certain band, to a certain sound.
It's cool. And I don't think
any of the people that use them
actually want Satan to rule the world.
It's just something that
enhances the experience for people.
The Satanism that you see is not Satanism.
It's some kind of...
... you know, it's some kind
of caricature Satanism.
If you're looking for Satanism,
first of all, you don't look to rock and roll.
A bunch of kids running around
playing loud guitars,
and going like that... That's Halloween.
<i>§ Tearing the flesh
off a weak tender child</i>
<i>§ Sparing my Lord, the meek and the mild</i>
<i>§ I sink my fangs in your neck
as you dream</i>
<i>§ I am Count Cronos
Vampire Supreme... </i>
When I first heard this band,
Venom, I wasn't thinking Halloween.
I thought they were truly satanic,
and I wasn't the only one.
I remember Venom scared
the shit out of me when I first heard it.
I actually refused to buy those records,
because I was scared.
I literally was scared I was doing
something wrong. It was like so extreme.
And now, of course,
anyone seeing this video, looking at me
as the guy that signed these bands
that was scared of Venom,
they're gonna wet their pants.
But it was different back then. This was
unheard of. That shit was truly disturbing.
Look how big Venom got because of it.
It's a way for bands to become popular.
Although Venom and early satanic
metal bands used Satan to shock people,
Slayer's lyrics
directly attacked Christianity.
And as a teenage boy, how could you
not get excited by album titles
<i>like Hell Awaits, Haunting the Chapel,
and Reign in Blood. </i>
Slayer was a leader
of the thrash metal movement,
which was influenced by the new wave
of British heavy metal, punk and hardcore.
Along with the world's biggest
metal band Metallica,
they introduced a new level of speed
and intensity to the genre,
and were known for using graphic lyrics
about war and religion.
I like to take pot-shots at religion because
I think it's the biggest brainwashing thing
that is totally acceptable in America,
and probably most
everyplace else in the world.
Um, I just think it's a load of shit.
Tom, another well-tread path
with you is your Christian background,
- and the juxtaposition with your music.
- Catholic.
What place do your personal beliefs
have in Slayer?
I consider what we do art, all right.
And it's... Art can be a reflection of society.
You know what I mean?
We're picking up the dark reflections.
You know, and that's what we're reflecting.
But evil's everywhere, man.
Everybody's got it.
It sits really deep in everybody.
Some people can't control it
as much as others.
But I think it's there. Regardless of
whatever fuckin' religion you believe in,
whatever it is you feel is right,
everybody knows what's wrong.
Everybody knows there's wrong things.
There are just things you do not do.
And the people that don't understand that,
then they're not really connected
with themselves, spiritually.
It doesn't matter what the fuck you believe.

When they wanted to make that an album

"I think it'll piss a lot of people off. "

The bands that want
to be badasses, pick badass subjects.
It's not that these people
believe in this stuff.
It's a cool imagery that goes along with
music. Some people do believe in it.
I'm not going to deny that
the Norwegian bands are real.
They've proven
they're real by their actions.
OK, so Venom
and Slayer aren't real Satanists,
but many fans, including me,
wonder if the Norwegian
black metal bands are the real thing.
So, I've come to Norway,
an isolated country in northern Europe.
Eighty-seven per cent
of Norway's population
belongs to the Lutheran State Church.
And yet strangely,
Norway's biggest cultural export
is satanic black metal.
We're filming a documentary.
Uh, it's a documentary
on heavy metal music.
We told 'em we were doing a documentary
on the history of metal, and he said,
<i>-  "Black metal?"
-  Did he say it like that?</i>
They know their metal here
in Norway, let me say.
<i></i>
Like thrash, black metal evolved from punk
and the new wave of British heavy metal,
with additional theatrical elements
borrowed from shock rock.
Its sound is raw,
yet it is also epic and atmospheric,
like punk rock meets Wagner,
dressed as Alice Cooper.
<i>§ I see a darkness overwhelming</i>
<i>§ I see that there is no light for me</i>
<i>§ I don't care if it leaves me blind</i>
<i>§ I don't care if I'm left behind... </i>
My journey takes me
on an overnight train ride
from the capital city Oslo to Bergen,
a small town on the fjords
of the country's west coast.
I'm here to talk to people
linked to incidents
involving members
of the black metal scene
and some of the country's oldest churches.
My name is Rolf Rasmussen.
I'm an assistant minister of this church,
Asane Church in Bergen, Norway.
I had been here for three and a half years,
when suddenly, the night before Christmas
Eve, I received a call from a colleague,
and he told me, "The church is on fire. "
And I fell into shivers,
right there in my bed.
And I dressed to go to the scene. And
coming to the church, it was all flames.
The firemen were trying to do their best
to contain the damage,
and we were there, the staff,
looking at the flames
and the smell was everywhere,
acrid and pungent.
And, uh... the fire...
The tower was still up when we arrived,
but after some time, maybe half and hour,
it fell heavily to the ground.
This was a great loss,
not just to us personally,
but to the whole community.
This church had been standing here
for nearly 200 years.
And I saw quite a lot of sad faces.
It was not a happy Christmas at all.
<i></i>
Varg Vikernes, the most notorious
metal musician of all time,
was implicated in a series of arsons
that destroyed some of Norway's
historic churches in the early '90s.
He was also convicted for murdering
a fellow black metal musician
and is now serving a life sentence.
J¢rn Tunsberg helped Varg
burn down the Asane church.
He served his time
and was recently released from prison.
We did meet with Rolf Rasmussen,
the minister of the Asane church, uh...
- and interviewed him.
- OK.
I'm very interested to hear from you, um...
your perspective on what happened.
The most important thing that happened
was that a church was burned down.
So, that's something I stand for and
I stood for it then, I will stand for it now,
and I will stand for it till I die.
Why is it important to you
that you stand behind your actions?
It's kind of, um...
It's kind of a statement to...
... to break down Christianity.
Lately there's been
a small trend by some people
to see Christianity and any
other established religion as the bad guy
and Satan as the liberator,
the one who can really, uh... turn you into
the powerful strong path
that you should lead.
What is the primary ideology,
or primary ideas
that fuel Gorgoroth's music?
Satan.
What does Satan embody
or what does he represent?
Freedom.
I think whether we like it or not,
black metal in Norway is known for, uh...
a string of events that happened in
the early 1990s around a series of arsons.
<i>I'm interested to know your thoughts
on the actions of those events,</i>
the motivations behind those events,
whether you agree or disagree with them.
Church burnings and all these things
are, of course,
things that I support 100 per cent.
And it should have been done much more
and will be done much more in the future.
We have to remove every trace
from what Christianity and, uh...
... the Semitic roots
have to... offer this world.
Satanism is freedom for the individual
to grow and to become the superman.
Every man who is born to be king
becomes king.
Every man who is born to be a slave,
doesn't know Satan.
It's in effect
an elitist's religion.
It's only for the best,
for the strongest, for the most successful.
It's not for the timid or the weak.
And so, by that virtue alone,
it won't have a large following.
What can you say?
Words of a Christian man.
So, I don't care
what he will ever say, you know.
I know for a fact
that they have lost a lot of followers
so we have been giving them
a fist in the face.
How do you feel
about what happened to the church?
In a way, I think that
Christianity in Norway deserved it.
It was... In the beginning it was, you know,
not something the Norwegians choose.
It was forced upon them.
You can say that's a thousand years ago.
But, you know, I wasn't sad.
I wasn't really happy either, but I mean...
In a historical point of view,
Christianity deserved it, you know.
I think society creates extreme people.
It's like with, you know, a free democracy
usually deserves its leaders
and it's... I would say,
it usually also deserves its outsiders.
If every metal band wants to be
more extreme than those that came before
then burning churches certainly
took things to a new level.
But these actions say less
about metal's theatrics
than they do about
Norwegian cultural sensibilities.
Resentment towards Christianity
in Norway goes back a thousand years
to their Viking ancestors.
In any case, the majority of metal fans,
including myself, could never understand
or defend these extreme actions.
I love going to Norway and Denmark. I love
picking up the black metal magazines.
It's so Spinal Tap.
Because each band
is trying to be more wicked and evil
than the other band, you know.
And it's... I can't turn the page without,
you know, "Look at this one!"
Here's these guys and they're...
You know, and... You know these guys.
When you meet them in the mall,
they're "Hello, Mr Cooper.
"Nice to meet you. My mother's over there.
Can she have your autograph?"
And I say,
"I thought you were like Satans. "
It's like "Well, yeah, we are,
but you know... "
Very rarely do you meet
anybody that's truly scary.
30 years ago, parents were losing
sleep at night over Alice Cooper.
Looking back, Alice seems harmless
compared to church burners,
but in the 70s, people thought
he was actually killing babies
and executing himself
on stage night after night.
Well, I mean, I was the...
I was the poster boy for controversy.
In some ways, I think I invented it.
Because we were the first band to get...
We got banned in England.
We got banned and nobody
could figure out why they were banning us.
We asked them in London,
"What are we banned for?"
They couldn't name anything. I said,
"Is there any nudity in our show?" "No. "
"Is there any bad language?" "No. "
"So, what are we being banned for?"
"Well, there's blood in your show. "
Has anybody ever seen Macbeth?
There was more blood in Macbeth,
and that's required reading in school.
There was no real definitive rock vampire
that was really the creature of the night.
That's what Alice was supposed to be.
If you say, "Welcome to my nightmare, "
you don't just say it, you do it.
Give them the nightmare.
Show them the nightmare.
<i></i>
<i>§ Ignoring your cries</i>
<i>§ Exposing your insides</i>
<i>§ Violence defined... </i>
Since Alice Cooper, nightmarish images
of death and violence in metal
have only become more vivid.
Nowhere is this more prevalent than in
the most extreme sub-genre: Death metal.
Building on thrash and black metal, death
metal's ingredients are guttural vocals,
machine-gun guitars,
and horrific album art.
The most infamous band
in this sub-genre is Cannibal Corpse.
In Germany, the first three
Cannibal Corpse albums are banned:
<i>Eaten Back to Life, Butchered at Birth,
and Tomb of the Mutilated. </i>
Any song from those records
cannot be played by the band live.
They're also banned
in New Zealand, first three.
We have to use alternate covers in
Australia. A lot of stuff is banned in Korea.
There's evidence to demonstrate
that the average young person
growing up today
sees more violence
through popular culture
than ever, uh... would occur in real life.
This has been marketed often
to young people, particularly teenagers,
who won't have the social context.
They don't have the background
of how violence has informed
our human condition over the years,
and so what they're left with is, um...
the glamourisation
of weapons and violence
as a form of conflict resolution.
This is a band by the name of
Cannibal Corpse. Have you heard of them?
And they've been at the centre
of a significant amount of controversy,
- regarding primarily their artwork.
- Mm-hm.
<i>This is their latest album, just released,
called The Wretched Spawn. </i>
What do you think of that?
Well, it's uh...
Things are even worse than I thought.
You've obviously... uncovered some
of the latest "leading edge" examples
of... what's out there in the music world.
I mean, I just can't see
how responsible societies
could turn a blind eye to this kind of thing
being sold and marketed to young people
as a form of harmless entertainment.
First time somebody who knows
nothing about the death metal scene...
The first time they see one of
our album covers, it's gonna shock them.
If it doesn't, then, we're not, you know...
We didn't make a very good album cover.
It's art. Look at it as art. Yeah,
it's disgusting, but there are lots of things...
Go to the Vatican and look at the art there.
Whew! That's representing something
that's real, that could happen.
This is... Obviously,
that's never going to happen.
You know, monsters
aren't gonna come out of...
aren't gonna rip out of people's bodies
anytime soon, I don't think.
On the one hand, as you see in lyrics
by a band like Cannibal Corpse,
there's this fascination with
the possibilities of death and the body.
On the other hand,
there's this terrifying fear of it.
There's an almost obsessive desire
to explore that which is dangerous,
that which is scary, that which points
towards obliteration, formlessness,
a delight in exploring the body
in its ways of being cut up,
destroyed and mutilated.
That's a very primal desire
that we all have.
There seems to be a connection between
how acquainted we are with our mortality
and how much we want
to see mortality and death
expressed in our art and culture.
If you look back a few generations, you'd
expect some of your siblings to have died.
When they died, they'd be laid out
in the front room, you'd see them there.
Then you'd probably sit down to a meal
where you'd be eating meat,
aware that this slab, of whatever it was,
had been living a few days back.
And it might well have
been you that cut its throat.
You knew that death
is part of the essence of life.
As we forget this,
we seem to crave images
of death and fear more and more.
I don't have a reason why
I craved images of death
or mutilation when I was younger.
But I do remember sitting on the bleachers
after school, my buddies and I...
We used to compete to see who could
come up with the most brutal metal lyric.
<i>And my favourite was Autopsy's
Charred Remains. </i>
I'll just read a bit for you because,
uh... I think you'll enjoy it.
"Burning from the inside out
"Bloody foam spews from your mouth
"Smell the putrid stench of flesh
"As it burns you to your death".
Afterwards, we would always
just, like, have a total round of high-fives.
Like, "Yeah, man, that was fuckin' brutal. "
I still think this music
is harmless entertainment,
but a lot of people think that metal lyrics
have a serious affect on kids.
Over the past 20 years,
metal artists such as Judas Priest,
Ozzy Osbourne, Cannibal Corpse, Slayer,
Marilyn Manson, and Slipknot,
have all come under fire for causing teens
to commit murder or suicide.
Although none of these cases
have succeeded, the cases keep coming.
Every time a serial killer
or a mass murderer,
or a Satanist,
or any evil person in our society...
Anytime the media's found out
they've listened to heavy metal music,
<i>it has been blown up as the reason,
the reason du jour, </i>
for why this person
is doing the things that they do.
You know, "Aha!
They were Manson fans, see?
"That's why they slaughtered
all those kids. "
American news, especially,
keys in on violence, you know.
And it's... And they're trying to promote
how wonderful American society is
and all they show is, "Bloodbath
at high school in Denver, " you know.
And they use that as a byline
for two, three days, you know.
And they sucker a lot of people in.
A line we wrote a while back...
<i>It's in Disciple.
"The beauty of death we all adore</i>
"'Cause TV sucks you in
And makes you want to see more of it. "
I do think that it's crazy
to argue that there is no relationship
between the imagery in metal
and, you know, some teen suicides,
and some acts of violence.
Sometimes metal messages are confusing.
<i>The song Suicide Solution
is about drinking yourself to death.</i>
But I can understand why a 13-year-old
<i>might be confused by a song
called Suicide Solution. </i>
I'm not shocked that some kid listened
to this and committed suicide over it.
Although, it's weird in the sense that,
if you're serious enough about Ozzy
Osbourne to kill yourself over his lyrics,
wouldn't you read
the liner notes more closely?
The most powerful predictor
of whether someone will commit suicide
is the feeling of helplessness.
Nobody listens to metal
in order to feel helpless.
They listen to feel empowered,
and connected with other people.
That may be empowered
through a song about suicide,
that makes you realise you're not alone.
Other people are going through the same
things. You don't need to kill yourself.
There's times you're sitting there alone,
thinking it can't get much worse than this.
And you...
And you're just looking for
something to help, and music did that.
It's never saying, you know,
just give up, 'cause I can't buy into that.
You know, I can't just give up
if I've had a bad day.
If I've had a really bad day, I'm not
gonna go drink, or fight someone.
I'm gonna go home
and listen to music, play some bass.
Cool.
We get letters from kids
that show how much our songs help them,
and they go home feeling better,
and they can go back to school.
I have a lot of kids say that when they wear
their Slipknot T-shirts, that they feel safe.
Violence has been around
a lot longer than we have.
Unfortunately, the ignorance
of Republican, puritanical thinking is,
they see a mosh pit, it's violent.
That's all they see.
Of course, pits can be brutal places,
but at the same time, it's like,
I'd rather have kids in the pit,
working out the stuff
they go through in their lives
than out hurting other people,
with no optimistic ends.
<i>§ 'Cause I'm already inside you</i>
<i>§ You can't kill me
'cause I'm already inside you... </i>
I love this song. Joey, I love you!
<i>§ 'Cause I'm already inside you... </i>
More! More! More!
Do you want some more?
Do you want some fuckin' more?
More! More! More!
So, here we are, 35 years after
Black Sabbath first played the devil's note
and metal culture is still thriving.
A new generation of fans has emerged,
and the old guard is going strong.
But I set out on this journey
to answer one question:
Why has heavy metal been consistently
stereotyped, dismissed and condemned?
What's become clear to me is that
metal confronts what we'd rather ignore.
It celebrates what we often deny.
It indulges in what we fear most.
And that's why metal will always be
a culture of outsiders.
For young people,
it's a place to belong
where you can experience
other possibilities
and transcend everyday life
in a very glorious way.
And it's a purging.
I think metal performs that task,
of sort of letting us get rid
of a lot of tension. It's a catharsis.
You want to have people
get up and start leaping around.
That's what it's for.
People in their own way
have different releases.
It's something
other than your mundane life.
The idea is that the way people
feel is as important as how they think.
I don't know why it's important. It just is.
I think I'm a better person
now that I've been listening to metal.
It doesn't judge me,
it doesn't criticise me.
It's just always there for me. Always.
For metalheads, good,
beauty, and truth, is up on stage there.
Is heavy metal
a sacrament? For some people.
If it keeps kids alive, if it gives them hope,
if it gives them a place to belong,
if it gives them a sense of transcendence,
then I believe it's a spiritual force.
I believe it's a pipeline to God.
Since I was 12 years old,
I've had to defend my love for heavy metal
against those who say
it's a less valid form of music.
My answer now is
that you either feel it or you don't.
If metal doesn't give you
that overwhelming surge of power
and make the hair stand up
on the back of your neck,
you might never get it.
And you know what? That's OK.
Because, judging by
the 40,000 metalheads around me,
we're doing just fine without you.
