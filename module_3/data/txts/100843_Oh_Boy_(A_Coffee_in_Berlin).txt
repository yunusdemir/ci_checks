Leaving already?
Hey.
Yeah, I gotta go.
So early?
I've got some appointments.
I'll call you, okay?
Sit down a moment.
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes.
Shall I make us some coffee?
That's sweet, but I'm already late.
What about tonight?
- I don't think I can make it.
- Why?
I've got a million things to do.
So what do you have to do?
- Hi.
- Hello.
Niko Fischer,
"repeatedly tested positive
for alcohol during
general traffic stops."
Is that correct so far?
That is correct, yes.
Are you nervous?
- A little.
- There's no need.
Although actually this is about
your driver's license, isn't it?
MPA, do you know
what that stands for?
Medical Psychological Assessment.
Also known in the vernacular as...?
- An idiot's test?
- Right. An idiot's test.
And who do you think is
the idiot here: you or me?
Well, me...
Because?
Because I was an idiot
and now you have to assess
if I can drive again.
Right.
You've been paying attention.
So, last time,
they pulled you over with 0.07%.
That's only just over the limit,
isn't it?
If you have to drive,
you shouldn't drink at all.
Yes. But one glass should be ok,
shouldn't it? A small one?
Not if you still have to drive.
But 0.07%, I mean,
that's like when my wife
scoffs three rum chocolate bars
every night.
Or do you think
my wife is a danger to traffic?
Let's put it this way:
if your wife has 0.07%
after three bars of rum chocolate,
then legally
she's not allowed to drive.
Is that something you're involved with?
Laws, rules?
I did study law.
Ah, a lawyer.
No, not a graduate.
Because“.
Because I dropped out.
Because“.
Because I realized
that it might not have been for me.
And what did your parents say
to that?
They weren't pleased, naturally.
But otherwise
you get on well with them?
Yes, very well.
Are you in a relationship
at the moment?
Mr. Fischer?
Are you in a relationship?
I understood the question.
I understood.
Then I'll write:
"Won't answer the question."
I really don't want
to sound rude, but
do such specific questions
really belong here?
Specific?
Mr. Fischer, I can get
a lot more specific.
Are you gay?
Do you have an inferiority complex
because you're so short?
Mr. Fischer, are you an alcoholic
because you're so teeny weeny?
I'm not an alcoholic.
Sometimes
I drink nothing for months.
Nothing means nothing
0.07% means 0.07%.
Did you drink anything today?
No coffee, no water?
Yes, of course.
I've had some water.
So, drinking automatically means
alcohol to you, right?
- No. I misunderstood.
- Misunderstood what?
- I wasn't expecting...
- Expecting what?
I wasn't expecting
such a leading question.
A leading question?
Come on, Mr. Fischer...
I'm a psychologist,
not a verbal acrobat.
I'd also rather party every night,
but that's not how it works.
- Forget about your driver's license for now.
- Why?
Because I think it's best.
You appear emotionally unstable
and your current situation
suggests a possible relapse.
You can't judge that so quickly!
Can't I?
I just did!
Have a nice day, Mr. Fischer.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
So, What'll it be?
- Coffee, please.
- To go, right?
What kind?
- Just normal coffee.
- Wanna try something new?
Today's special is the Marocchino.
For <i>2</i> Euros extra, you get
a doughnut or seed roll,
all home-made and organic.
I think I'll stick with coffee.
Sure, we've got two kinds:
the Arabica or
the Colombia Morning.
Which coffee tastes
most like regular coffee?
I like both.
Fine, I'll take the Colombia.
The Colombia, then.
You want milk?
- We've got soy milk.
- No, thanks.
Okay, then.
Three Euros forty, please.
Without today's special.
Just the coffee.
Yes, three Euros forty, please.
Three forty for a regular coffee?
Yeah, that's the Colombia.
You could have mentioned that.
I've got two, twenty,
sixty, seventy, eighty.
That's not enough.
Can't you make an exception?
Sorry, I really can't.
Otherwise every burn
will want their coffee for free.
- Bum?
- Yeah, bum!
Hello, Mrs. Mosebach,
it's Niko Fischer.
Could I speak to my Dad, please?
Could you ask him to call me?
You just moved in, didn't you?
Yeah, a couple of weeks ago.
Why?
Karl Speckenbach.
I live upstairs with my wife.
I wanted to introduce myself.
- Welcome.
- Wow, thank you!
A little welcome present.
My wife's meatballs.
That's kind.
Thank you.
She was in the kitchen all morning.
I have to admit I already
nabbed two on my way down.
They're really good. Try one!
- Aren't they good?
- Oh yeah.
- Moving is a lot of work, right?
- Yes.
I haven't really moved in yet.
I watched you carry
all those boxes from my window.
Usually
I wouldn't hesitate to help,
but my wife says
I should take care of my back.
- I slipped a disc last year.
- That doesn't sound good.
What doesn't sound good?
The thing with your back.
Ah, that.
It's no big deal.
Well, as I said,
I just moved in,
I can't really offer you anything.
Cheers.
Did you watch the game last night?
Champions League?
Sensational game.
Do you like football?
Sometimes.
I'm crazy about football.
I installed a hobby room
in the basement.
With a couch, table football,
flat screen, the whole shebang.
And that's where I sit
and watch all the games.
And sometimes
I watch special films there.
- Is that your girl?
- That's an old photo.
That's your sweetheart, huh?
Am I right?
Where was that taken?
Paris.
Paris...
Somehow I envy you.
Young, in love,
probably thinking of kids too?
And you?
Do you have kids?
My wife and I don't get up
to much these days.
Nothing...
We used to do it all the time,
everywhere,
but for the last five years,
nothing.
Cancer, breast cancer,
all of a sudden, just like that.
They took her whole rack,
you know?
I tried.
I wanted to explain.
I'm sorry.
I just can't.
Instead I'm down in my basement.
And she's upstairs,
cooking and cooking and cooking.
What am I supposed to do?
What am I supposed to do?
Haven't you got anyone to talk to?
Like who?
I don't know.
Maybe an old friend.
Damn women, they wear you out,
man, they wear you out.
Yes?
Matze... Hello.
Someone should clean up this city.
I said, someone
should clean up this city.
Because
it's full of filth and scum.
I get headaches
every time I go for a walk
and have to smell this filth.
Unbelievable.
The headaches keep getting worse.
I have an idea.
The president
should burn down the city,
or flush it down a huge toilet.
"Taxi Driver"?
Exactly.
Thank you.
Yes, a coffee, please.
A mineral water.
Niko?
- Niko Fischer?
- Yes?
Wicked!
Julika.
Julika Hoffmann.
We went to school together!
- Sure?
- Yes,
I was about
three times bigger then.
You and the others
used to call me Roly Poly Julie.
Julika.
Now I remember...
- That's like 11, 12...
- 13 years ago.
Crazy!
You look completely different.
Thankfully.
- So... grab a seat!
- I don't wanna interrupt.
You're not interrupting.
Please, sit down.
Thanks.
- This is Matze.
- Hello.
Hello.
- Insane!
- So! What are you doing?
Yeah, I'm...
And you? Tell me.
How are you?
I don't know if you remember,
but I was transferred
to boarding school.
Yes... I remember.
Yeah, it was a boarding school
for overweight kids.
But it helped a lot.
Well, that sounds... that sounds
really, really good, right?
Yeah. Oh boy,
I had such a crush on you.
In spite of all the humiliation.
It's a difficult age,
isn't it? 13, 14?
Totally! You cry all night long,
you harm yourself.
Once I even tried to kill myself.
Yeah,
that was the reason my parents
sent me to that boarding school.
Anyway.
No hard feelings.
<i>'</i> AnVWaV, I've got to go.
- Already?
- What are you doing tonight?
- Actually, we've got no plans.
Well, I might have one or two
appointments. Why?
There's a performance art show.
I don't know if you're into that?
Are you kidding?
I'm an actor.
To be honest, I'm in it.
Anyway, think about it.
I'll leave two tickets
for you.
Okay, I'll see if we can make it.
What the hell!
We'll definitely come.
Really? Great!
Niko Fischer...
Wicked.
Roly Poly Julie.
What time does it start?
Nine.
Okay, I'll pick you up at eight thirty?
I don't think that's a good idea.
Of course it is.
She's giving us tickets.
Hello?
We're almost there.
I'm bringing a friend.
You freak. See you in a moment.
Friend of mine.
Works round the corner.
Can you drop me at home first?
Hey, Matze, this is great!
Heil Hitler!
Yeah, totally Heil Hitler!
Come here, man!
- So, how's it going?
- Fantastic.
- My pal, Niko.
- Nice to meet you. Philipp Rauch.
Great to see you guys.
Come on in!
I'm sorry, it's a mess.
Somebody really needs to clean up.
- Close the door?
- Yeah, close it.
- This is bigger than my apartment.
- It's too big, I totally agree.
That suit looks good on you.
Imagine this gone.
Just the cut and fabric.
What do you think?
Actually, you look like my Grandpa.
"Well, Rommel? The game's up.
Drop your pants!
Or I'll cut your ugly tongue out!"
"Heil Hitler!"
That's the Matze I know.
Spot on.
Sit down, come on.
Get rid of those damned autographs.
So, tell me, is there
a role going in this for me?
Maybe something small.
I can ask right now.
Only if you don't mind.
No, not at all. I play the lead.
You as well?
- No, thanks.
- Why not? It would be awesome!
- I really don't want to. Thanks.
- Suit yourself.
But what's it about?
- What, you mean the film?
- Yeah.
Yeah, what's the actual story?
What's it about?
That's a good question.
I play a young sensitive writer
just before the Second World War
who falls in love
with a beautiful bookseller
but doesn't know she's Jewish.
And then war breaks out
and they lose touch,
and six years later,
I'm a loyal officer who toes the line--
not blindly,
I've still got a conscience--
and I'm conducting a house search
where the Jews live,
and now comes the moment
when all of a sudden,
he meets Hannah again.
That's the name of the bookseller.
And now my character's facing
a conflict, you know.
Save, betray, save, betray,
how, why, what, you know.
And at the very last moment,
he makes a decision
and saves her from...
- Deportation.
- Deportation, thanks.
Then he hides her in the basement.
Love breaks out once again.
And one night,
she suddenly confesses to him...
Guess what?
That they have a child together?
Jakob, a little boy, six years old.
And they took him from her.
That's the moment,
for this Heinrich guy,
when something breaks
inside of him.
It's total catharsis,
and he wants this kid,
he wants his boy...
Then it gets really dramatic and...
but I won't spoil the ending.
Who makes this stuff up?
I hope this is based
on a true story?
Yeah, well,
it was the Second World War.
Hey, Niko, come here.
Come here. I won't bite.
Come on, Niko, sit down.
You can see it on the monitor.
<i>So 'now do you and Maize
know each other'?</i>
We met in the neighborhood.
- Okay, done.
- Thank you, Connie.
- And you?
- Pardon?
- How do you know Matze?
- Acting school.
That was ages ago.
If anyone had real talent,
it was our friend there.
Just a few months into acting school
and he already had an audition.
I was passing this door,
it was just open,
and I see this guy act.
People went nuts, I tell you.
Thousands of offers:
TV, cinema, theater, everything.
There were some really
good things there, I tell you.
What happened?
Nothing. He turned everything down.
Thought everything sucked.
Instead he sat around in bars
waiting for the right role.
But it never came.
Don't get me wrong.
I love the guy.
He's a fantastic actor
and a great human being.
I know.
Speak of the devil...
Matze, come over here.
- Sit down.
- Thanks.
- So, what's the boss say?
- Looks good.
He'll call me back tomorrow.
See how easy it is?
Ready to roll.
Guys, I gotta go.
Duty calls.
Don't run away!
- Sound?
- Sound speed.
Hannah!
What's up?
Heinrich?
War is over.
What did you say?
Yes, Hannah, you heard me right.
Berlin's been taken.
There's word in the street
that Hitler has surrendered.
But that means we're free at last!
No,you.
You are free, Hannah.
Now I'm the one who has to hide.
No, I'll tell everyone
what you did for me.
The whole world must know
that you weren't part of this.
You've no idea what I've done...
Beautiful Hannah.
Farewell.
Just a second, please.
<i>I can hardly hear you.
Why is that?</i>
Okay, now.
<i>Where are you?
I can hardly hear you.</i>
I was in the library.
I can't talk there, you know.
<i>The library?
Sounds like you're working hard.</i>
- So to speak.
- Good to hear.
<i>You called?</i>
That's right, I called...
<i>I called back
but I got voice-mail.</i>
I'm sorry...
Do you ever <i>check</i>
your messages?
Sometimes, yeah.
<i>If I didn't answer, this shit house
would close tomorrow.</i>
I called, because my cash card
was swallowed this morning.
<i>Really? I'm about to drive down
into the parking lot,</i>
<i>but I'll be on the course soon.</i>
<i>Why don't you swing by?
We can talk then.</i>
Okay, I can manage that.
And if not--
Okay, see you there.
Fuck.
Waggling.
Fuck me,
that was at least 200 meters.
- Maybe even 250.
- Ah, the champ is here.
Always late,
but he always gets there.
Hello.
- What's up?
- How are you?
You know,
bad people are always fine.
Schneider, my new assistant.
Niki, my favorite son.
- His only one.
- Don't be too sure about that.
- Pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.
Grab an iron. Let's get rid of
some of these balls.
I don't know if that's
a good idea.
Come on, don't be a sissy.
Show us what you got!
Hit it!
All right, then.
Weak.
Really weak.
Your stance is wrong, Niki.
Take the right angle to the
hitting direction, like you learned.
Like that?
My dear child,
you mustn't bend your wrist.
Leading arm straight, a swing,
a single motion, follow through.
Wonderful!
Schneider, give it a go.
Hello!
Supeﬂ
Last two balls, Schneider vs. Niko.
Loser buys the drinks.
150, good, that's gonna be hard.
Schneider, it looks a little gay
but it works.
Imagine who you'd
smack over the head with that club.
When the posture is right,
hit it hard!
Well, then, I'll get the drinks.
What's it gonna be?
Coffee would be great.
No way,
it's much too late for coffee.
- You could use a schnapps!
- Isn't it a bit early?
- Come on, we'll have three schnapps!
- Three schnapps.
Schneider's a good man.
Finished his law studies last year.
Okay.
One year younger than you.
And how about you?
All good.
I think I'll be done next year.
If you have time,
I'd like some advice from you.
Any time.
What's your professor's name again?
- You mean Kollath, right?
- Dr. Kollath.
Very nice, competent,
good professor.
So what about this bank thing?
Right. What's that about?
The cash machine kept my card.
Really strange.
Very odd.
- So, then. Cheers.
- Actually you have to drive.
- Excuse me?
- Schneider.
Get the car, please.
We have to leave.
- Very nice meeting you.
- Thanks. You too.
Yeah, how do we solve
the bank thing?
Niko, why are you lying to me?
I met your professor last week.
At a convention in Zurich.
He told me you dropped out
two years ago.
He couldn't tell me why.
My question to you, Niko,
is what have you
been up to the last two years
while I've been transferring
money for your studies every month?
I've been thinking.
You've been thinking?
And about what,
if I might ask?
About me, about you...
about everything.
I transfer a thousand Euros a month
so you can think about me?
Listen, when your mother
squeezed you out, I was 24.
I didn't have time to think.
I had to make money!
I was taking exams by day
and working by night
because Niko wanted
trumpet lessons
and dropped out after a year.
Niko wanted Capoeira
lessons and dropped out after a year.
Niko wanted fencing,
guitar, piano lessons
and dropped them all.
Why aren't I surprised that
you dropped out of your studies?
You're like your mother.
Anything else
you want to say?
Here.
Your account is closed.
I'll give you a tip: cut your hair,
buy some decent shoes and
get a job, like everyone else.
The only thing I can do,
is do nothing for you anymore.
It was lovely, a real pleasure.
- Okay, I need your ID, please.
- Your ID.
- The machine was broken.
- Maybe, but still I need your ID.
Absolutely not.
- Absolutely.
- ID, please.
Listen, I tried to buy a ticket,
but the machine was broken.
Do you understand?
If you want people to buy tickets,
make sure
those things are working.
A broken ticket machine
can never be ruled out.
See? There you go!
In that case you have to
get off at the next station
to purchase a ticket
to resume your ride accordingly.
Accordingly!
Purchasing a ticket
is entering into a contract.
I'd like to have a ticket,
but I don't.
Your case is different: use of
public transport without a valid ticket.
That's 40 Euros
and your ID details.
This fun
will cost you 40 Euros.
Why does he repeat
everything you say?
- I don't.
- You do. The whole time!
Like a little robot.
- Your ID, please.
- ID!
- See? Again.
- Now listen.
40 Euros and your ID,
or I'll call the police.
Just like that.
But you won't get my ID.
- Now you are repeating yourself.
- Right.
So, you wanna see my ID?
Dear Lord, yes!
First I wanna see your IDs.
We're not allowed to show them.
For security reasons.
You think that's funny?
I can't even tell you my name.
Isn't that hilarious?
But you may take our duty numbers.
So we're clear: you want my ID
but can't show me yours.
Correct.
You can have our duty numbers.
Let me guess: yours is R2D2.
- Watch it!
- Hey, Stefan, what's wrong today?
I swear,
I'm gonna blow a fuse soon.
- Everyday the same shit.
- I know, we've talked about this.
Calm down.
Stefan!
Stop right there!
Stefan, don't be stupid...
SharePirate.Com Subs
- Chewing gum and vodka, please.
- One?
- Pardon?
- One bottle?
Two, please.
We should have turned there.
I know.
Then why are you going straight?
It's a surprise.
- Yes?
- Good evening, Mrs. Baumann.
Is Marcel home?
I beg your pardon?
Marcel?
Is he home?
Yes.
Who are you?
We're friends of Marcel's.
Could you tell
him we're here?
And what do you want from Marcel?
Come in. It's okay, Granny.
These are friends of mine.
Come on in.
Evening.
So what can I do for you?
You need sneakers?
- No, we need the other thing.
- Okay, how much?
Two .
Might take a minute,
I haven't weighed it yet.
- Marcel?
- Yes?
- Are your friends hungry?
- Are you hungry?
- No, thank you. How about you?
- No.
I could fix some sandwiches.
No, Granny, that's lovely,
but maybe later?
Hey, Marcel,
can I use your bathroom?
- You can chop one out right here.
- I really just need the bathroom.
- Opposite.
- Thanks.
I'm Niko, Matze's buddy.
I'm Mrs. Baumann,
Marcel's grandmother.
- Are you hungry?
- No, thanks.
I can fix some sandwiches.
That's really kind, thank you.
I'm not hungry.
That's a fancy armchair
you've got there.
Marcel gave it to me.
Do you want to try it?
No, no, thank you,
I didn't mean to intrude.
And now lean back and
make yourself comfortable.
- Like this?
- Yes, just like that.
What's happening now?
Yeah, this is good!
Niko.
Niko!
Are you coming
or do you wanna sleep here?
- No, I'm coming.
- You can sleep here.
That's very kind,
but we've got to go.
Take care of yourself, Niko.
I will.
Hi, there should be
two tickets for Niko Fischer.
You're pretty late.
We couldn't find a parking space.
Too bad. The performance
has already started.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means the performance
has already started.
Can't we do anything?
- Who are the tickets from?
- They're from Julika.
- Julika who?
- Julika...
Roly Poly Julie.
Hoffmann.
3rd row.
Be quiet, the performance
has already started.
There you are!
We almost made a toast without you!
I've brought someone with me.
This is Sabrina,
Kerstin and Stella.
I went to boarding school
with Stella.
Hey, honey, there you are.
Now, can we finally get started?
I'm proud of you all. Cheers!
- Friends of yours?
- Yes, these are Malte and Niko.
This is Ralf, the author and
choreographer of tonight's show.
Great performance.
Thank you.
- So you liked it?
- Absolutely!
So why did you laugh the whole time?
Aren't you the guys from the third row
who came in late?
- What's going on?
- You might not have heard.
They laughed the whole time.
- That's not true.
- Honestly, I heard it, too.
I was so immersed in the role,
I didn't notice anything.
I can understand
if our art is not your thing,
because we don't produce
that mainstream nonsense.
But why did you come here?
Julika left us two tickets.
- That's right.
- Really?
It's getting better and better.
You get yourselves invited, you're late,
you can't spare
three Euros for a ticket,
then you ridicule our premiere.
That's great.
Well, I hope you had
a jolly good time.
Come on, we weren't that bad!
In some places
I thought it was meant to be funny.
Funny?
Now, that I find interesting.
You'll have to explain that.
What are all these strange vibes?
Let's just relax
and have a little party!
Wait!
What exactly did you find funny?
Well, the portrayal of birth,
for instance.
You have to admit that it did come
across slightly comical.
Then, I have to ask myself,
seriously,
why aren't we all born laughing?
Why do we cry and scream?
Explain that to me!
That has to do with opening
the respiratory system.
- Are you a doctor?
- No, I read it somewhere.
- What do you do for a living?
- Nothing.
Nothing?
Yes, but it wasn't me laughing.
- And you?
- I'm...
currently working
in advertising.
You said you're an actor.
Now that's really interesting.
Let me guess.
State Theater, BE, DT, Burg?
Or some other government-funded
mental institution?
No, not at all.
What do you do, then? Film?
- Berliner Sonderschule?
- I've nothing against what you do.
What's so terrible about us
trying to breathe fresh air
into the off-theater scene?
What you're doing here is
highly commendable!
Commendable?
Excuse me,
have you got a light?
Thanks.
Fuck off!
I was afraid you'd
already gone home.
I just wanted to have
a quick smoke
before spoiling
the rest of your party.
Rubbish.
You didn't spoil our party.
- I think Ralf would disagree.
- Ah, Ralf...
Ralf needs to chill out.
He's always a bit sensitive
when it comes to his work.
For good reason.
Sometimes I'm not so excited
about what he comes up with.
Why do you do it then?
Because it's my hobby.
And because I love standing
on that little stage
knowing people are watching me.
When you reveal yourself
in front of total strangers,
it feels so good
that I don't care
if people think it's embarrassing.
I didn't find it embarrassing,
I liked it.
Liar.
No, seriously.
I thought you were...
You were courageous.
Yeah, I don't know.
I wouldn't have the guts.
You weren't always this cautious.
What was I like then?
You always seemed to know
exactly what you wanted.
What is it?
I don't know.
You know when...
You know when you get the feeling
that the people all around you
are kinda strange somehow?
But when you think about
it a little longer,
you realize it's not the others
butyou
who's the problem?
Excuse me.
I didn't want to interrupt,
but do you perhaps have a smoke?
I don't smoke.
Sure.
Thanks.
And maybe for my boys, please?
Just take some.
You're a gent.
You're not from Berlin, right?
We are. Now we'd like
to continue our conversation.
No prob, just a sec.
Come here, you dicks.
I'll introduce you to Kevin,
because he's got a question.
Ask her, Kevin.
Fuck off.
Go on, don't be a pussy!
I'll give you 10 Euros
if you show me your tits.
Very funny.
- Come on, can't you take a joke?
- That's a top offer!
You frigid or what?
Julika, forget it.
How old are you? 17, 18?
None of your business.
Why don't you grow a cock
before harrassing women
in the street?
And what kind of guy
are you anyway?
Let me guess.
You were born an alcoholic
because your mom couldn't stay
off the booze during her pregnancy.
How could she,
when she got beaten up by Daddy
- when he came home from the pub?
- Shut your fucking trap.
One day Daddy didn't come home
and then your mother blamed you.
Since then
you think the world sucks.
And that's why
you're hanging out
with your little school gang
playing leader
when all you wanted was a hug.
- Don't tolerate that shit, Ronny.
- Yeah, don't be toleratin', Ronny.
I said shut the fuck up, whore!
- Whore?
- Can't we go inside?
Look, there's a real whore.
She'll let you get some.
If you ask nicely
she'll let you call her Mommy!
- I'll shut you up, you cunt!
- Hands off, loser!
You are the loser, Ronny.
- I'll fuck you!
- Why don't you just go home?
You're dead!
You're fucking dead, bitch!
Fucking whore!
Those little dicks.
- We should have called the police.
- Rubbish.
They were only kids
looking for fun.
Does it hurt badly?
Did I look pathetic
when I hit the floor?
Not at all.
Maybe a little bit.
No, seriously.
You intervened
and that's what counts.
If you hadn't provoked them,
none of this would have happened.
What do you mean?
Well, you laid into them
pretty hard, eh?
I mean, ignore them
and they move on.
Everybody knows that.
Do you know how
many times in my life
I've tried to ignore
what other people say?
What you said?
Do you have any idea how it feels
to be a girl in her puberty
who weighs 180 pounds
and gets called names:
Roly Poly Julie
and Elephant Girl and...
Fatty?
Do you know how that feels?
Of course I don't.
It feels awful,
and it took a really long time
for me to get over it.
That's why I don't ignore
anything anymore.
Not a thing.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
You look really great.
Really?
Absolutely.
But deep in my heart
I'm still the same.
That small, fat,
sad little girl.
Do you wanna fuck
the fat little girl?
Say you wanna fuck
the fat little girl.
- Come on, say it.
- You mean say or...?
Yes, say it.
You want to fuck
the fat little girl.
- I want to fuck the fat little...
- Yeah, say it!
I want to fuck the fat little...
Yes, say it louder, come on.
Wait. Stop. Stop,
Julika, wait, stop, stop!
What's up?
I don't think
we should be doing this.
Why not?
Am I too fat for you?
Just kidding, go on.
Well, you know,
this feels kind of weird.
You really think I'm too fat?
What?
Julika, listen.
All I meant was...
Well, it simply feels weird.
If we do this
after so many years
just to, you know,
come to terms with the past.
What?
To come to terms with the past?
What a pathetic little shit
you are!
Why don't we go outside again
and get a drink?
Get your hands off me!
People line up to fuck me.
So get out.
I'll finish you off!
Get out fast
or I'll get hysterical. Go!
Julika...
I said piss off!
NOT EVERY COW CAN BE MILKED.
Are you still serving coffee?
Not anymore, no.
I've cleaned the machine already.
All right then.
Vodka and a beer.
Sure.
You're a lone wolf, eh?
Two more, please.
I don't understand people anymore.
I don't understand a word they say.
Listen, if you don't mind,
I'd like to be alone, okay?
I don't have the faintest idea
what they're talking about.
Do you know what I mean?
I mean...
Listen, that sounds like
a different language, doesn't it?
They're talking German.
Ah, they're talking German?
- Most of them, anyway.
- Well, then,
I ought to understand them.
I'm speaking German, too,
am I not?
- As a matter of fact, yes.
- Well, actually I am.
Your good health, my friend,
your good health.
You're not from here, are you?
Ah, what are you talking about?
Of course I'm from here.
I was merely away for a while.
Sixty years.
Back then you were just a twinkle
in a sailor's eye, weren't you?
- Where were you for sixty years?
- Gone.
And now I'm back.
I see.
You see nothing.
Not a thing.
Back then, this all looked
a little different, my dear.
My school was back there.
I was this tall.
We all pissed our pants
because we had to stand
at attention before class
and salute the Führer:
Heil Hitler here,
Heil Hitler there...
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Yeah, it's all right.
You can't really imagine,
when you're that small.
What you're doing.
You do what everyone does.
Always this.
No, always this.
Or do you beg to differ?
Yeah, do you beg to differ?
What do I know?
Maybe in retrospect...
Yeah, of course,
in retrospect.
My dear friend,
we didn't have retrospect then.
Retrospect.
Sixty years I was gone.
I remember precisely.
That parking lot
was our playground.
Us rascals used
to kick a ball in the afternoons.
I was the smallest,
I was always the goalie.
And here...
on the corner, my old man
taught me how to ride a bicycle.
I'll tell you, I don't remember
how many times
I fell flat on my face.
But he didn't give up.
Over and over again.
Until one day I was cycling
along here all alone, right?
Well, maybe the bike
was a bit too big for me.
Everyone on the street
always laughed a little
as I rode up and down,
proud as a peacock.
"Don't let them laugh at you"
my Dad said.
But I never thought
they were laughing at me.
I always thought
they were happy for me.
So when did you leave?
Sometime
in the middle of the night,
father woke me and said:
"Come out to the street, my boy.
I want to show you something."
And I went outwith him
onto the street.
And he pressed some stones
in my hand and he said,
"Now, show me what you've got."
And he took a stone
and smashed that window pane.
Right here where we're sitting.
And the street was full of people.
It was pitch black.
Not bright like today,
where everything glows
and sparkles
because people can't bear
the dark any longer.
Pitch black.
And all the people on the street
smashed the windows with stones.
And my father smashed that store...
to bits.
And I stood over there
on the street
and everything was covered
in broken glass
and everything was burning
and the street was sparkling
because the fire was so bright.
And I still remember clearly
that at one point
I started to weep.
NOW, guess why?
Why?
Because I thought that,
with all the broken glass,
I couldn't ride my bike anymore.
- Hey, hey. ls everything all right?
- What?
Are you all right?
I can't understand you.
Call an ambulance, please.
- You can't go in.
- I wanna know what happens to him.
- Are you a relative?
- No.
Then please take a seat
over there.
OUT OF ORDER
Is he better?
He died.
I'm sorry.
Have you contacted
his family?
He doesn't have one.
Nobody?
Could you tell me his name?
I'm not allowed to do that.
His first name?
Friedrich.
