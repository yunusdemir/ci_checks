<i><b>All right.</b></i>
<i><b>- All right, I'm Clif Prowse.
- And I'm Derek Lee,</b></i>
<i><b>and tomorrow we're going
on a year-long trip around the world!</b></i>
<i><b>This is the trip that I've been
waiting to do my entire life.</b></i>
<i><b>Clif and I, six continents,
over 30 countries.</b></i>
<i><b>We're gonna see the Eiffel Tower,</b></i>
<i><b>the pyramids, the Great Wall.</b></i>
<i><b>It's gonna be epic.</b></i>
<i><b>My parents started me traveling
when I was really, really young,</b></i>
<i><b>and up until the day
that I graduated,</b></i>
<i><b>I pretty much spent
every spare moment on the road.</b></i>
<i><b>And then, I don't know,</b></i>
<i><b>I got what I thought was
a great opportunity in I.T.</b></i>
<i><b>Next thing I know,
five years have gone by</b></i>
<i><b>with me sitting behind a desk,
and I'm thinking to myself,</b></i>
<i><b>"What the hell did I just do
with my life?"</b></i>
<i><b>Hey. buddy. Are you okay?</b></i>
<i><b>Hello. My name is Clif Prowse.</b></i>
<i><b>I am a filmmaker
and documentarian.</b></i>
<i><b>I have known
the aforementioned Derek Lee</b></i>
<i><b>since we were both
pimple-faced teenagers,</b></i>
<i><b>and I basically forced him to be
in every single one of my movies.</b></i>
<i><b>Am I nervous? Hell, yes.</b></i>
<i><b>Okay? I don't like planes.
I don't like heights.</b></i>
<i><b>I don't like the Ebola virus.
I don't even like spicy food.</b></i>
<i><b>But this is gonna make
for some spectacular footage.</b></i>
<i><b>We are going to film
the entire thing.</b></i>
<i><b>We are going to post it online</b></i>
<i><b>as the world's greatest
video travel biog ever.</b></i>
<i><b>We're calling it "Ends of the Earth.“</b></i>
<i><b>And we wanted this to be
as interactive as possible.</b></i>
<i><b>So you guys post suggestions,
anything you want us to do.</b></i>
<i><b>The craziest shit. I don't care.</b></i>
<i><b>You want us to go eat live crickets
in Cambodia,</b></i>
<i><b>we will do that.</b></i>
<i><b>Derek will do that,
and I will film him doing that.</b></i>
<i><b>Everybody. Everybody.</b></i>
<i><b>This is a very important
Chinese tradition.</b></i>
<i><b>Jade is to ward off evil spirits.
It can never be bought for yourself.</b></i>
<i><b>It must be given by another. So, Clif...</b></i>
<i><b>Going away for an entire year,</b></i>
<i><b>I am going to need someone
to watch my back.</b></i>
<i><b>I need someone who has seen me
puke my brains out.</b></i>
<i><b>I need someone who's seen me
at my absolute worst.</b></i>
<i><b>A' need someone who would take
a buffet for me.</b></i>
<i><b>That's Clif.</b></i>
<i><b>I am so envious that you guys
are about to take off</b></i>
<i><b>on this awesome trip
around the world.</b></i>
<i><b>Most of us experiment in college.</b></i>
<i><b>You guys take until now,
but we're thrilled.</b></i>
<i><b>We're thrilled you guys
are finally taking this leap.</b></i>
<i><b>To Clif and Derek.</b></i>
<i><b>I think that Derek's decision
to go on this trip is courageous,</b></i>
<i><b>but there are some people
who think it's a mistake.</b></i>
<i><b>- Hey, man, how's it going?
- Good.</b></i>
<i><b>We're leaving soon. Very soon.</b></i>
<i><b>What does Mom think?
You talk to her?</b></i>
<i><b>- Yeah, I--
- She's starting to get a bit concerned</b></i>
<i><b>because if something goes wrong
on the road, it's really hard to--</b></i>
<i><b>Look, if anything does happen,</b></i>
<i><b>there's only really, like,
a 4 percent chance of any--</b></i>
<i><b>A 4 percent chance</b></i>
<i><b>in some shit-box town
on a long-distance bus</b></i>
<i><b>is a hell of a lot different
than falling on the ﬂoor</b></i>
<i><b>in your kitchen,
where your roommates will pick you up,</b></i>
<i><b>can' the hospital and say,
"He's somebody who has ARM. "</b></i>
<i><b>A few months ago,
I started getting really bad headaches.</b></i>
<i><b>I went to the doctors.
They took an MRI.</b></i>
<i><b>And they told me I have something
called an arteriovenous malformation,</b></i>
<i><b>or A FM,</b></i>
<i><b>which is basically like a tangle
of screwed-up blood vessels</b></i>
<i><b>in my brain which if it ruptures,</b></i>
<i><b>can cripple or kill me.</b></i>
<i><b>Look, Derek, I'm not gonna tell you
not to go on your trip,</b></i>
<i><b>but if you develop severe headaches,
weakness in your limbs,</b></i>
<i><b>loss of the ability to write,</b></i>
<i><b>it could be a sign
that your REM has ruptured,</b></i>
<i><b>and it's really important that you seek
medical attention right away.</b></i>
<i><b>I have to go, dude, so it's...</b></i>
<i><b>She's not gonna understand,</b></i>
<i><b>and she's never gonna understand.</b></i>
<i><b>And she's my mom,
so she's not supposed to.</b></i>
<i><b>- I get that. That's cool.
- Whatever, dude.</b></i>
<i><b>I don't think you have to...</b></i>
<i><b>Yeah. Whatever. Okay.</b></i>
<i><b>Given everything he's dealing with,</b></i>
<i><b>I think it's pretty incredible
that Derek is going on this trip.</b></i>
<i><b>He is a normal guy
who got dealt a shitty hand,</b></i>
<i><b>and in spite of that,
he's not letting it stop him</b></i>
<i><b>from doing the things that he loves.</b></i>
<i><b>I'm going on this trip
because I wanna be there for Derek,</b></i>
<i><b>and I'm documenting it</b></i>
<i><b>because I want to share his story
with everyone back home.</b></i>
<i><b>I don't know how much time I have,</b></i>
<i><b>and I don't wanna regret anything.</b></i>
<i><b>I don't wanna look back on my life</b></i>
<i><b>and wish I had done something
bigger or better.</b></i>
<i><b>I just wanna travel.</b></i>
<i><b>And if I'm gonna see the world,</b></i>
<i><b>I kind of have to go right now.</b></i>
<i><b>Okay, here we go.</b></i>
<i><b>Clif has entrusted me
with the B cam here</b></i>
<i><b>to get some establishing shots.</b></i>
<i><b>That's really lame,</b></i>
<i><b>so instead, you guys get to see
what crazy looks like.</b></i>
<i><b>- Hello.
- Hello, people.</b></i>
<i><b>- My God.
- Come. Come see my studio.</b></i>
<i><b>What are you doing
with all this gear'?</b></i>
<i><b>- Are you ins--? Oh, man.
- This is where the magic begins</b></i>
<i><b>that is "Ends of the Earth--"
That will be "Ends of the Earth."</b></i>
<i><b>That's a lot of gear, dude.
What exactly is this?</b></i>
<i><b>That is a strap-on.</b></i>
<i><b>- A what?
- Strap-on.</b></i>
<i><b>Basically, I put that on,</b></i>
<i><b>this thing clicks in,
I can put the camera right here,</b></i>
<i><b>which means I can shoot
multicameras at the same time.</b></i>
<i><b>One man, multicamera shoot.</b></i>
<i><b>Up to three cameras, in fact.</b></i>
<i><b>It is, in fact, amazing.</b></i>
<i><b>This is gonna be awesome,
by the way.</b></i>
<i><b>- What up?
- All right, we are here</b></i>
<i><b>in beautiful Barcelona, Spain, in front
of the Christopher Columbus statue,</b></i>
<i><b>about to start
our year-long trip around the world.</b></i>
<i><b>Derek, can you explain to us,
why are we starting here?</b></i>
<i><b>You mean other than that?</b></i>
<i><b>Easy. Rock stars.</b></i>
<i><b>Edo Van Breemen and Zach Gray
are two friends of ours</b></i>
<i><b>who are here on tour
with their band, Unalaska.</b></i>
<i><b>We're gonna hang out with them
here in Barcelona</b></i>
<i><b>before joining them in Paris
for their final show.</b></i>
<i><b>Oh, there he is.</b></i>
<i><b>- How's it going?
- Voyeurism, monsieur.</b></i>
<i><b>- I can't believe I'm seeing you here.
- Hey.</b></i>
<i><b>Has he been doing this for however
long you guys have been here?</b></i>
<i><b>- Did you guys check in or not?
- Yeah. No, this is the camera gear.</b></i>
<i><b>You're kidding.</b></i>
<i><b>- Okay. Guys.
- Oh, no.</b></i>
<i><b>We're here. Check it out.</b></i>
<i><b>- The GoCar.
- The GoCar.</b></i>
<i><b>So I have to say, we're already
having a hard enough time</b></i>
<i><b>because we're naturally
less cool than all Europeans,</b></i>
<i><b>and now this.</b></i>
<i><b>It'll provide for some bonding time</b></i>
<i><b>- between the two of you, I suppose?
- Yes.</b></i>
<i><b>- Everyone--
- Wait a minute.</b></i>
<i><b>- Why am I in this thing?
- Why are you guys not more excited?</b></i>
<i><b>- It's cool. it's...
- What the hell...?</b></i>
<i><b>You're gonna pick up
a lot of girls today</b></i>
<i><b>riding this thing around town,
especially at the beach.</b></i>
<i><b>Fine. No one else gets it, but I get it.</b></i>
<i><b>And we're gonna have
a damn good time today.</b></i>
<i><b>I don't really care
what these guys say.</b></i>
<i><b>All right. B camera right here.</b></i>
<i><b>Two cameras, baby. Two cameras.</b></i>
<i><b>This is the best city in the world.</b></i>
<i><b>The only two factors that determine
how good a time you have</b></i>
<i><b>in a new city are the weather
and the people.</b></i>
<i><b>And I don't think
we could ask for much more.</b></i>
<i><b>We've had an amazing two days.
The footage is phenomenal.</b></i>
<i><b>Probably the coolest thing
is just seeing Derek looking so happy</b></i>
<i><b>for the first time in a really long time.</b></i>
<i><b>A weight has been lifted
off his shoulders,</b></i>
<i><b>and I can't wait
for the next couple of days,</b></i>
<i><b>because things are gonna get
even crazier.</b></i>
<i><b>Holy shit. Holy shit!</b></i>
<i><b>It was way more scary
than I thought it was gonna be.</b></i>
<i><b>Oh, my God.</b></i>
<i><b>Group hug. Group hug.</b></i>
<i><b>Oh, I love this. Feel the love.</b></i>
<i><b>Okay, Derek. If we can find you</b></i>
<i><b>a suitably drunk French girl
with low enough standards,</b></i>
<i><b>do you think you can take her home?</b></i>
<i><b>Let's take a quick poll.</b></i>
<i><b>I think that he's gonna succeed in...</b></i>
<i><b>In getting her
where he wants to get her,</b></i>
<i><b>but I think that she's gonna
have a horrible time.</b></i>
<i><b>I don't know, with that Canadian vibe,
hes not going anywhere tonight.</b></i>
<i><b>Actually, with you guys at my wing,
I'm pretty much screwed.</b></i>
<i><b>I'll be impressed
if he just talks to a girl tonight.</b></i>
<i><b>Clif will be filming.</b></i>
<i><b>That'll add a certain amount
of pressure.</b></i>
<i><b>- Yes, we have to get this on film.
- No, I'm on your side.</b></i>
<i><b>- This is important.
- Can we...? Can we not...?</b></i>
<i><b>Let's not encourage this, okay?
You gotta--</b></i>
<i><b>You gotta not be filming
the whole night.</b></i>
<i><b>Actually, I have something for you.</b></i>
<i><b>It's condoms.</b></i>
<i><b>I think this is the lucky one.</b></i>
<i><b>Actually, I'll give you all of them.
They're all lucky ones.</b></i>
<i><b>Oh, this is very optimistic of you.</b></i>
<i><b>They're French condoms, so they're
probably the best in the world.</b></i>
<i><b>We're Unalaska, and we're gonna
play some songs for you tonight.</b></i>
<i><b>I'm the brother
That you never meet</b></i>
<i><b>I'm an anchor
When you swim in the sea</b></i>
<i><b>Oh, a life sentence
Like a battery beast</b></i>
<i><b>And I only see the light
When you smile with teeth</b></i>
<i><b>No luck?</b></i>
<i><b>Have you been telling them
obnoxious travel stories'?</b></i>
<i><b>- Yep.
- You need to lead with</b></i>
<i><b>"I have a brain aneurysm."</b></i>
<i><b>Okay, that might be a little bit
too close to home.</b></i>
<i><b>Dude, there are tons
of cute girls in there.</b></i>
<i><b>We are gonna go
find you one right now.</b></i>
<i><b>Too hot for Derek?
Possibly. I don't know.</b></i>
<i><b>Derek, I got one! Derek!</b></i>
<i><b>Hell has frozen over.</b></i>
<i><b>Derek Lee has found a lady.</b></i>
<i><b>Hi.</b></i>
<i><b>Hi. I'm-- I'm Clif.</b></i>
<i><b>Buddy, hey, back off with the--
Buddy.</b></i>
<i><b>I'm the skeleton in your body</b></i>
<i><b>You will never get a glimpse of me</b></i>
<i><b>Attaboy, Derek.
I knew you could do it.</b></i>
<i><b>And now I'm filming
my friend making out.</b></i>
<i><b>Good stuff.</b></i>
<i><b>So I'm supposed to act natural
while you're, like...</b></i>
<i><b>Act natural. Just talk to Clif.</b></i>
<i><b>We are leaving, so...</b></i>
<i><b>- Oh, yeah, okay.
- If you wanna come party with us,</b></i>
<i><b>- call this, my number.
- Holy rock star moment.</b></i>
<i><b>Were trying to figure out
what we're doing with our hotel tonight</b></i>
<i><b>because our friend went back there
with a girl, so...</b></i>
<i><b>Okay, that's fine. So you don't sleep
and, like, party all night.</b></i>
<i><b>I have to say congratulations
for him doing it with a girl</b></i>
<i><b>because I always congratulate
my friends for that.</b></i>
<i><b>- We don't know--
- It's hard to do.</b></i>
<i><b>We don't know
if he's actually doing it.</b></i>
<i><b>- There's only one way to confirm.
- We could find out.</b></i>
<i><b>There's only really one way to--
Exactly.</b></i>
<i><b>What you're suggesting is the...
The Turkish cock block.</b></i>
<i><b>I believe that that is what ifs called.</b></i>
<i><b>I think we should elaborate
on that point.</b></i>
<i><b>The Turkish cock block
is not in the spirit of friendship.</b></i>
<i><b>But it is something that friends do.</b></i>
<i><b>- And it is hilarious.
- And ifs hilarious.</b></i>
<i><b>And I think we really need to do it.</b></i>
<i><b>- Edo, confirmation?
- Operation Cock Block is a go.</b></i>
<i><b>This is--
This is hands down the shittiest thing</b></i>
<i><b>I've ever done to a friend,
but we're gonna do it,</b></i>
<i><b>because it's in the spirit of Paris.</b></i>
<i><b>- In the spirit of Paris. I like that.
- Yeah.</b></i>
<i><b>Okay. Can I just say,
because we're filming this,</b></i>
<i><b>that I am against this completely
because it's mean?</b></i>
<i><b>Yeah, well,
you can go sleep in the lobby.</b></i>
<i><b>- We're not.
- I'm independent.</b></i>
<i><b>One, two, three.</b></i>
<i><b>Cock block!</b></i>
<i><b>- Holy shit.
- Derek?</b></i>
<i><b>- Fuck me.
- Derek?</b></i>
<i><b>- Derek, Derek.
- Hey, man.</b></i>
<i><b>Derek? Derek?</b></i>
<i><b>- Dude, what-J
- Call an ambulance.</b></i>
<i><b>- Call an ambulance!
- What happened here?</b></i>
<i><b>Call an ambulance!</b></i>
<i><b>Derek, wake up.</b></i>
<i><b>Wake up!</b></i>
<i><b>- Derek, are you okay?
- You're bleeding, man.</b></i>
<i><b>Shit, it's on his head.</b></i>
<i><b>What the hell happened, man?</b></i>
<i><b>What did Audrey do to you?</b></i>
<i><b>I don't know. I don't remember.</b></i>
<i><b>Is she running around the city
naked right now?</b></i>
<i><b>I mean, she left all her clothes.</b></i>
<i><b>Look, I just said
I don't remember, man.</b></i>
<i><b>Like, she comes in, she...</b></i>
<i><b>She hits me in the head,
everything goes hazy,</b></i>
<i><b>and the next thing I know,
you guys are rushing in, so...</b></i>
<i><b>We shouldn't be taking you
to the hospital, right,</b></i>
<i><b>like, given your condition?</b></i>
<i><b>No, I don't think so.</b></i>
<i><b>- You're sure?
- Yes, I am sure.</b></i>
<i><b>Like, look, this looks way worse
than it is, all right'?</b></i>
<i><b>I just wanna keep going.</b></i>
<i><b>Are you groggy? Are you okay?</b></i>
<i><b>- Yeah, I'm okay.
- All right.</b></i>
<i><b>- We gotta go.
- This is it.</b></i>
<i><b>- All right.
- See you.</b></i>
<i><b>Take care, dude.</b></i>
<i><b>- Take care of this guy.
- Yeah.</b></i>
<i><b>- See you, man.
- Take care of your wife.</b></i>
<i><b>All right, bye.</b></i>
<i><b>Cilia?'-</b></i>
<i><b>I guess that'll be your place.</b></i>
<i><b>What the hell, man?
You're still asleep?</b></i>
<i><b>Get up. Come on, man. Get up.</b></i>
<i><b>This is ridiculous.
You've been asleep forever.</b></i>
<i><b>Come on, seriously, man.
Come on.</b></i>
<i><b>Come on, came on, some on.</b></i>
<i><b>- How long have I been out?
- A while. Way too long.</b></i>
<i><b>- Come on. Come on, come on.
- Okay. Okay.</b></i>
<i><b>Let's go. Contacts, clothing.</b></i>
<i><b>Emerging into the outer world</b></i>
<i><b>where you can interact
with other humans beings.</b></i>
<i><b>Why are you...? Why are you 50...?
Why are you so annoying?</b></i>
<i><b>Because, man, we're supposed
to be on this trip together.</b></i>
<i><b>- What the hell?
- Yes. lam here.</b></i>
<i><b>- Guess I'm hungry. Sorry.
- Yes.</b></i>
<i><b>Well, I know exactly
the place we can go.</b></i>
<i><b>Good.</b></i>
<i><b>Yeah. Two, please.</b></i>
<i><b>This place is amazing, man.
Look at this place.</b></i>
<i><b>Little sleepy boy here
has been sleeping the days away</b></i>
<i><b>and missing this
Mediterranean paradise.</b></i>
<i><b>Seriously, look at that.</b></i>
<i><b>I'm starving. What are you having?</b></i>
<i><b>Pesto.</b></i>
<i><b>All right, look at that.</b></i>
<i><b>Oh, jeez. Thank you.</b></i>
<i><b>- Looks amazing.
- Look at that.</b></i>
<i><b>This food looks so good, man. This...</b></i>
<i><b>I am...</b></i>
<i><b>Are you even listening
to me right now?</b></i>
<i><b>Oh, Jesus Chri...</b></i>
<i><b>Derek.</b></i>
<i><b>Derek. What the hell?</b></i>
<i><b>Derek, wait.</b></i>
<i><b>Hey.</b></i>
<i><b>Hey, man, how are you feeling?</b></i>
<i><b>Better.</b></i>
<i><b>Look, I just think that with everything
that's been going on with you,</b></i>
<i><b>that we should go talk
to somebody about this.</b></i>
<i><b>Clif, I'm not going to the hospital.</b></i>
<i><b>Okay, it's probably
just food poisoning, so...</b></i>
<i><b>Derek, what are you talking about?</b></i>
<i><b>What are you doing, man?
You got hit in the head.</b></i>
<i><b>This isn't something
to fuck around with, man.</b></i>
<i><b>Clif.</b></i>
<i><b>If I go,</b></i>
<i><b>okay, and they find something,</b></i>
<i><b>they might not let me leave, okay?</b></i>
<i><b>And I don't wanna spend
another second in a hospital.</b></i>
<i><b>I feel fine.</b></i>
<i><b>So, like, we're not stopping the trip.</b></i>
<i><b>- Look, are we doing this or not?
- Yes, I'm rolling, okay?</b></i>
<i><b>- Go.
- Okay.</b></i>
<i><b>Clif has arranged a tour
with a local vintner named Bartolo</b></i>
<i><b>here at his-- At his cantina.</b></i>
<i><b>It's Chen Wines.</b></i>
<i><b>Let's go.</b></i>
<i><b>- Hello.
- Oh, good morning.</b></i>
<i><b>- Hi. I'm Derek.
- Oh, nice to meet you.</b></i>
<i><b>- My name is Bartolo.
- Bartolo.</b></i>
<i><b>This is our cellar.</b></i>
<i><b>We have the largest cellar
in town.</b></i>
<i><b>- Really?
- This doesn't mean so much,</b></i>
<i><b>because in Vernazza
the cellars are very tiny.</b></i>
<i><b>Everybody has his own cellar.</b></i>
<i><b>So how do you feel</b></i>
<i><b>about showing us the vineyard,
the vines, the.)</b></i>
<i><b>Going up on the mountain?</b></i>
<i><b>Okay, is not so far. ls very easy.</b></i>
<i><b>You missed this cute pig.
What are you...?</b></i>
<i><b>This is Judita, my pig.</b></i>
<i><b>Judita.</b></i>
<i><b>He's very cute.</b></i>
<i><b>In this area,
the main production is white grapes.</b></i>
<i><b>There is a little bit crazy
because this environment, to me--</b></i>
<i><b>Clif. We gotta go down.</b></i>
<i><b>- We gotta go down the mountain now.
- Shit.</b></i>
<i><b>Clif! I have to go down</b></i>
<i><b>- the mountain now.
- What's wrong with your skin?</b></i>
<i><b>- Go in casa.
- Just go. Just go.</b></i>
<i><b>Derek, just go. Go! Go!</b></i>
<i><b>Shit.</b></i>
<i><b>Derek! What do--? What do you need?
What do you need?</b></i>
<i><b>- Water! Water!
- Okay, okay, okay.</b></i>
<i><b>What the hell is going on?</b></i>
<i><b>Here it is! Here it is!</b></i>
<i><b>Are you okay?</b></i>
<i><b>Are you okay?</b></i>
<i><b>- What...?
- I don't know.</b></i>
<i><b>I don't know.</b></i>
<i><b>Jesus.</b></i>
<i><b>Look.</b></i>
<i><b>What the fuck is wrong with me?</b></i>
<i><b>Jesus.</b></i>
<i><b>I need your guys' help.</b></i>
<i><b>Because seeing what I saw
at the vineyard today,</b></i>
<i><b>with Derek and his skin,
I don't think I've ever seen anyone</b></i>
<i><b>in as much pain
as I saw Derek today.</b></i>
<i><b>And, you know,</b></i>
<i><b>I know we talked
about doing this thing for a year,</b></i>
<i><b>but, like...</b></i>
<i><b>I need to convince him
to come home,</b></i>
<i><b>and he's not gonna listen to me.</b></i>
<i><b>He's only gonna lisp-</b></i>
<i><b>I'm-- I'm really sorry,
but I'm worried about you.</b></i>
<i><b>You're sick.</b></i>
<i><b>And I don't think
you're being honest with me</b></i>
<i><b>or with yourself about this, okay?</b></i>
<i><b>You're really sick.</b></i>
<i><b>Like...</b></i>
<i><b>What happened
at the vineyard was...</b></i>
<i><b>And you're still not eating.</b></i>
<i><b>And...</b></i>
<i><b>I...</b></i>
<i><b>I'm your friend,
and I feel responsible for you.</b></i>
<i><b>And I can't in good conscience
just let you stay here and hurt yourself.</b></i>
<i><b>We have to go home, okay?
It's the right--</b></i>
<i><b>Jesus Christ.</b></i>
<i><b>Fuck. Fuck.</b></i>
<i><b>Are you okay?</b></i>
<i><b>- Yeah, I'm good. I'm good.
- You just broke the wall.</b></i>
<i><b>What is this wall made out of?
It's like... It just disintegrated.</b></i>
<i><b>It's made out of rocks, man.</b></i>
<i><b>Are you-J?' Did you --?
Did it hit you? Are you okay?</b></i>
<i><b>Yeah, I'm okay,
but you just broke a rock wall.</b></i>
<i><b>Like, look at-- Look at this.</b></i>
<i><b>It's, like, crumbly and dry
and old and shitty.</b></i>
<i><b>- Wait, wait, wait.
- And I need to go</b></i>
<i><b>- to anger-management classes.
- Try this one.</b></i>
<i><b>What do you mean,
"try this one"?</b></i>
<i><b>I want you to break this
like you did the last one.</b></i>
<i><b>That is awesome.</b></i>
<i><b>All right, I'm rolling.</b></i>
<i><b>Just do it, man. Just do it.</b></i>
<i><b>Come on, man. You can do it.</b></i>
<i><b>Holy shit.</b></i>
<i><b>Oh, my God.</b></i>
<i><b>You just... Are you okay?</b></i>
<i><b>- I will be.
- Oh, my...</b></i>
<i><b>Oh, shit.</b></i>
<i><b>- All right, I'm rolling.
- Strength test.</b></i>
<i><b>- One, two...
- Go at three.</b></i>
<i><b>Three.</b></i>
<i><b>- Go, go, go.
- Oh, shit.</b></i>
<i><b>Holy crap.</b></i>
<i><b>Holy cow.</b></i>
<i><b>What is it like to be a superhero?</b></i>
<i><b>Oh, my God.
Let's go, like, fight some bad guys.</b></i>
<i><b>I don't know if you guys saw that
or not back home,</b></i>
<i><b>but that was absolutely unbelievable.</b></i>
<i><b>I hope I got it on tape.</b></i>
<i><b>I think I just broke the sound barrier.</b></i>
<i><b>What's it like?</b></i>
<i><b>You just...
You just lifted a car. Come on.</b></i>
<i><b>I don't know.
I don't know what's going on.</b></i>
<i><b>All right. Are you ready?</b></i>
<i><b>- Just go.
- All right, here we go.</b></i>
<i><b>Okay. I'm at 20.</b></i>
<i><b>I'm at 40.</b></i>
<i><b>I am at 60 kilometers an hour!</b></i>
<i><b>Holy shit!</b></i>
<i><b>You were going 60K,
which is like 40 miles an hour.</b></i>
<i><b>- How do you explain that?
- I don't know.</b></i>
<i><b>Is there any way
this could be related to your AVM?</b></i>
<i><b>- Derek, are you okay?
- Oh, my contact.</b></i>
<i><b>Fuck.</b></i>
<i><b>- What is it?
- I don't know, man.</b></i>
<i><b>Can you just...?
Can you just turn that off?</b></i>
<i><b>- Just turn off the camera.
- What?</b></i>
<i><b>Cm, just-- cur--</b></i>
<i><b>Look, I don't wanna be a dick,
but turn off your camera.</b></i>
<i><b>There's something wrong with my...</b></i>
<i><b>Are you okay?</b></i>
<i><b>What the fuck?</b></i>
<i><b>Fuck.</b></i>
<i><b>What are you doing?
Dude... Dude, don't.</b></i>
<i><b>- Stop pulling.
- Clif... Clif...</b></i>
<i><b>- Derek.
- Did I just pull out my eye?</b></i>
<i><b>- What them?
- Did I just pull out my eye?</b></i>
<i><b>Oh, my Gad, your eye.</b></i>
<i><b>- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- What are you...?</b></i>
<i><b>I don't know. I don't know.
I just saw it for a second. I mean...</b></i>
<i><b>- Oh, the other one.
- Derek.</b></i>
<i><b>Oh, my God, are you okay?</b></i>
<i><b>Holy shit.</b></i>
<i><b>Jesus Christ.</b></i>
<i><b>What the hell is wrong with you?</b></i>
<i><b>Shit.</b></i>
<i><b>He's ignoring my mom's e-mails.
He's ignoring my e-mails.</b></i>
<i><b>- What do I do?
- You're the only person--</b></i>
<i><b>If he's not listening to anybody,
what the hell am I supposed to do?</b></i>
<i><b>Yeah, but you're the only guy
who's physically able</b></i>
<i><b>at this point
to do anything about this.</b></i>
<i><b>You know how it is.
He's freaked out.</b></i>
<i><b>He does not know what's going on.
You need to be the one who gets him</b></i>
<i><b>to somebody
who can take a good look at him</b></i>
<i><b>and understand
what this is all about.</b></i>
<i><b>Because I certainly can't do it
from here.</b></i>
<i><b>I'm just worried
if we don't get him somewhere soon,</b></i>
<i><b>it's gonna be beyond the point
where I can do anything about it.</b></i>
<i><b>Derek?</b></i>
<i><b>Look, man, I... We need to talk.</b></i>
<i><b>Derek?</b></i>
<i><b>Jesus!</b></i>
<i><b>What the hell? That's not funny.</b></i>
<i><b>- Yes, it was.
- You need to go to a hospital.</b></i>
<i><b>- No.
- What do you mean, no'?</b></i>
<i><b>I mean no. I feel fine.</b></i>
<i><b>You are not fine.
You are clearly not fine.</b></i>
<i><b>What do you need me to do?</b></i>
<i><b>You want me to prove it?</b></i>
<i><b>- Are you rolling?
- Yes. I hit the record button.</b></i>
<i><b>- Okay.
- What the hell are we doing here?</b></i>
<i><b>Okay, I'm super strong. Right?</b></i>
<i><b>And super fast.</b></i>
<i><b>- Jump test number one.
- What are you talking about?</b></i>
<i><b>Holy shit.</b></i>
<i><b>Derek, please just come down.</b></i>
<i><b>I told you I was okay.</b></i>
<i><b>That's great,
but you're being ridiculous, okay?</b></i>
<i><b>Can you just please
come down from there?</b></i>
<i><b>You're such a baby.</b></i>
<i><b>- Okay, look, I'm fine, all right?
- You're not fine, okay?</b></i>
<i><b>- Let's just go home.
- No, we're not going home.</b></i>
<i><b>We're not going anywhere.
We're staying right here.</b></i>
<i><b>Let's test. Come on, let's test.</b></i>
<i><b>Shit.</b></i>
<i><b>Derek, what are you doing?</b></i>
<i><b>Derek, you're freaking me out
right now.</b></i>
<i><b>Just stop. Okay?
Come down from there.</b></i>
<i><b>Okay, Clif, here it is.</b></i>
<i><b>If I make this next jump,
that proves that I am not sick.</b></i>
<i><b>What?</b></i>
<i><b>No, this isn't gonna prove anything.</b></i>
<i><b>Oh, my God. Derek?</b></i>
<i><b>Proved it. Okay?</b></i>
<i><b>Oh, shit.</b></i>
<i><b>Are you okay?</b></i>
<i><b>Okay. Okay.</b></i>
<i><b>Hospital.</b></i>
<i><b>Okay, we're here
in downtown La Spezia.</b></i>
<i><b>It's about 20 minutes from Vernazza.
It's the closest place with a hospital.</b></i>
<i><b>Derek, you okay?</b></i>
<i><b>Okay, well, maybe the doctors
can finally figure out</b></i>
<i><b>what the hell's going on. Oh, shit!</b></i>
<i><b>Jesus.</b></i>
<i><b>I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</b></i>
<i><b>Don't touch my--</b></i>
<i><b>Holy shit.</b></i>
<i><b>Oh, my God.</b></i>
<i><b>Derek, what the...?</b></i>
<i><b>Oh, shit. Holy shit.</b></i>
<i><b>It's okay. it's okay.</b></i>
<i><b>Okay, he's still breathing.
He's still breathing.</b></i>
<i><b>Let's get out of here.</b></i>
<i><b>I don't know what I was thinking.
I just...</b></i>
<i><b>I uploaded the footage,</b></i>
<i><b>and Mike posted this.</b></i>
<i><b>Shit.</b></i>
<i><b>Derek?</b></i>
<i><b>Derek, I need you to explain to me</b></i>
<i><b>exactly what happened
on the way to the hospital.</b></i>
<i><b>Did you lick blood off your hand?</b></i>
<i><b>Oh, my God.</b></i>
<i><b>Okay, so...</b></i>
<i><b>What are we saying about this?</b></i>
<i><b>Look, I won't post it,</b></i>
<i><b>but if this is what we think it is,
then we have to document it.</b></i>
<i><b>Right?</b></i>
<i><b>It says here that you should have
the ability to turn into mist,</b></i>
<i><b>maybe even a bat,</b></i>
<i><b>you have command
over certain vermin,</b></i>
<i><b>such as rats and wolves,</b></i>
<i><b>and you are unable to enter
into someone's homestead</b></i>
<i><b>unless specifically invited, which is--</b></i>
<i><b>- That's a weird one.
- It's fucking useless.</b></i>
<i><b>I'm just trying to harness the power
of the Internet</b></i>
<i><b>to help you
with your vampire problem.</b></i>
<i><b>How do you think this happened?</b></i>
<i><b>Oh, my God.</b></i>
<i><b>Audrey.</b></i>
<i><b>It's gotta be, right?</b></i>
<i><b>What are we gonna tell people
about this?</b></i>
<i><b>I don't know.</b></i>
<i><b>I mean, we're going to have
to tell them something, right?</b></i>
<i><b>Clif...</b></i>
<i><b>Blood.</b></i>
<i><b>Where are we gonna get the blood?</b></i>
<i><b>Cow's blood?</b></i>
<i><b>Yeah, I just...
I went to the butcher.</b></i>
<i><b>Cilia?'-</b></i>
<i><b>Shit.</b></i>
<i><b>Fuck.</b></i>
<i><b>That smelled awful.</b></i>
<i><b>I think it might need to be fresh.</b></i>
<i><b>- What did you get?
- Some sausage, I think.</b></i>
<i><b>You know we're going to hell, right?</b></i>
<i><b>- Like, this is disgusting.
- Oh, my God.</b></i>
<i><b>- You eat meat, right?
- What? Yeah, I eat meat.</b></i>
<i><b>Do you have a pet cow?</b></i>
<i><b>People don't sleep
with cows in their beds</b></i>
<i><b>and name them and...</b></i>
<i><b>These dogs are owned by people.</b></i>
<i><b>These are like members
of their family.</b></i>
<i><b>So...</b></i>
<i><b>Are you serious? That's, like,
the cutest dog I've ever seen in my life.</b></i>
<i><b>- That's the one you want?
- Fuck off.</b></i>
<i><b>There's no feral dogs around here.
They all have owners.</b></i>
<i><b>Oh, my God,
I can't believe we're doing this.</b></i>
<i><b>- Derek, just--
- Quiet.</b></i>
<i><b>Promise me you'll make it as quick</b></i>
<i><b>- and painless as possible, okay?
- Shut up.</b></i>
<i><b>No, no, no.</b></i>
<i><b>Christ.</b></i>
<i><b>Derek.</b></i>
<i><b>Oh, my God, oh, my God.</b></i>
<i><b>Dude, shit.</b></i>
<i><b>Clif is...</b></i>
<i><b>Clif isn't dealing well
with what just happened.</b></i>
<i><b>It has to be human blood.</b></i>
<i><b>We've been through everything else.</b></i>
<i><b>So, yeah, we're gonna have to do
something very, very stupid.</b></i>
<i><b>Okay. We're here outside
the hospital in La Spezia.</b></i>
<i><b>Derek has gone
inside the blood bank</b></i>
<i><b>to see if he can bribe an orderly
or something.</b></i>
<i><b>- Did you get it?
- No, no, no, just run! Just run!</b></i>
<i><b>What the hell happened?</b></i>
<i><b>I didn't get it, okay?</b></i>
<i><b>Jesus, I had to show them
my ID, Clif.</b></i>
<i><b>They know who I am.</b></i>
<i><b>What are we gonna do?</b></i>
<i><b>Wait. Listen. Listen.</b></i>
<i><b>- Listen for what?
- Okay.</b></i>
<i><b>- What are you doing?
- Oh, yes. Yes.</b></i>
<i><b>Hey!</b></i>
<i><b>Get in the ambulance, Clif.
We gotta get out of here.</b></i>
<i><b>- What are we doing here?
- Oh, shit.</b></i>
<i><b>Worst idea ever, Derek.</b></i>
<i><b>Blood. I need blood.
Do you have any blood?</b></i>
<i><b>I need blood!
Do you have any blood?</b></i>
<i><b>She does not speak English, Derek.</b></i>
<i><b>Clif, it's networking. Help me.</b></i>
<i><b>- Clif. Clif, help me.
- You're talking in English, you idiot.</b></i>
<i><b>You're talking in English.</b></i>
<i><b>- Goddamn it!
- What are we gonna do?</b></i>
<i><b>I don't even know how
to drive this thing.</b></i>
<i><b>- I don't know how to drive stick, man.
- Just keep driving.</b></i>
<i><b>Where are we going?</b></i>
<i><b>Derek.</b></i>
<i><b>Derek, what are you doing?</b></i>
<i><b>Derek, stop!</b></i>
<i><b>Just go.</b></i>
<i><b>Clif... I almost killed her.</b></i>
<i><b>- I know. Just go.
- I almost killed...</b></i>
<i><b>The cops are coming. Go.</b></i>
<i><b>Go, go.</b></i>
<i><b>- Oh, my... Come on, Derek.
- No, Clif, listen.</b></i>
<i><b>Promise me if things get any worse,
you will leave.</b></i>
<i><b>- Come on, man. We have to go.
- Clif. Promise me.</b></i>
<i><b>Okay, I promise. Just come on.</b></i>
<i><b>Derek?</b></i>
<i><b>Derek, is that you?</b></i>
<i><b>Fuck.</b></i>
<i><b>Derek?</b></i>
<i><b>Derek, wha...?</b></i>
<i><b>What the f...?</b></i>
<i><b>Oh, my God. Derek?
Oh, my God, oh, my God.</b></i>
<i><b>Derek, just bite on this.</b></i>
<i><b>Oh, shit. Derek.</b></i>
<i><b>Derek has been unconscious
for 11 hours.</b></i>
<i><b>I can't take him to the hospital,</b></i>
<i><b>because the cops
are gonna be waiting for us.</b></i>
<i><b>He's mostly unresponsive,</b></i>
<i><b>except...</b></i>
<i><b>...I think he can smell my blood.</b></i>
<i><b>The thing is,</b></i>
<i><b>ifs still Derek.</b></i>
<i><b>I... I know there's a part of him</b></i>
<i><b>that's still in there,</b></i>
<i><b>and I'm not gonna leave him.</b></i>
<i><b>Derek?</b></i>
<i><b>Derek...</b></i>
<i><b>Get away from me.</b></i>
<i><b>Derek. Derek, I got it.</b></i>
<i><b>Derek?</b></i>
<i><b>Derek?</b></i>
<i><b>Derek!</b></i>
<i><b>Where the hell are you?</b></i>
<i><b>Shit.</b></i>
<i><b>Derek?</b></i>
<i><b>Shit. Someone in there?</b></i>
<i><b>Derek?</b></i>
<i><b>Derek, is that you?</b></i>
<i><b>Jesus!</b></i>
<i><b>I brought you something.</b></i>
<i><b>I know... I know ifs not much.</b></i>
<i><b>Just... Just take it.</b></i>
<i><b>Take it!</b></i>
<i><b>Clif...</b></i>
<i><b>I'm sorry.</b></i>
<i><b>The...</b></i>
<i><b>...suicide...</b></i>
<i><b>...was pointless.</b></i>
<i><b>It didn't solve anything.</b></i>
<i><b>Clif,</b></i>
<i><b>you sacrificed everything for me.</b></i>
<i><b>And I will never forgive myself</b></i>
<i><b>for what I did to you.</b></i>
<i><b>There has to be a way to fix me.</b></i>
<i><b>So I need to find Audrey.</b></i>
<i><b>Everything starts with her.</b></i>
<i><b>She has to have an answer.</b></i>
<i><b>A cure, something.</b></i>
<i><b>Do you hear me, Audrey?</b></i>
<i><b>Why? Why would you do this?</b></i>
<i><b>Where...? Why...?</b></i>
<i><b>You just can't do this to somebody
and just take off.</b></i>
<i><b>Like, wha...?</b></i>
<i><b>What the hell's...?</b></i>
<i><b>I'm coming to Paris,</b></i>
<i><b>and I'm gonna find you,</b></i>
<i><b>and you are going to fix this.</b></i>
<i><b>You're gonna fix this,
or I'm gonna kill you.</b></i>
<i><b>Clif is gone.</b></i>
<i><b>How that's ever gonna be okay,
I don't know.</b></i>
<i><b>But I am going to honor his memory</b></i>
<i><b>by keeping the cameras rolling,</b></i>
<i><b>by documenting this in the hopes
that somehow some good</b></i>
<i><b>can come of this.</b></i>
<i><b>It's what Clif would have wanted.</b></i>
<i><b>We never officially tested this.</b></i>
<i><b>Sun test number one.</b></i>
<i><b>Okay, that's good.</b></i>
<i><b>Cilia?'-</b></i>
<i><b>Audrey is in Paris.</b></i>
<i><b>Which has, like, a population of like</b></i>
<i><b>12 million or something.</b></i>
<i><b>I just don't have a plan.</b></i>
<i><b>Hello'?</b></i>
<i><b>Mr. Derek Lee?</b></i>
<i><b>- Yeah, who is it?
- I'm from Interpol.</b></i>
<i><b>Open the door.</b></i>
<i><b>Shit.</b></i>
<i><b>I'm Inspector Barbiero
with Italian Interpol.</b></i>
<i><b>- Is Clifton Prowse here?
- No, he's left.</b></i>
<i><b>Mr. Lee, we have video footage
of you breaking into a hospital.</b></i>
<i><b>Then you stole an ambulance
and endangered lives.</b></i>
<i><b>- My God.
- You have to come with me.</b></i>
<i><b>The Canadian embassy--</b></i>
<i><b>Oh, shit.</b></i>
<i><b>- Interpol.
- Oh, shit.</b></i>
<i><b>No, no, no, don't shoot!</b></i>
<i><b>Stop it! Stop shooting me!
Stop shooting me!</b></i>
<i><b>Sorry.</b></i>
<i><b>Okay. Okay.</b></i>
<i><b>I am somewhere east of Nice.</b></i>
<i><b>Good thing is
my face stopped bleeding.</b></i>
<i><b>Managed to get out of that place
with just my clothes on my back</b></i>
<i><b>and the camera bag.</b></i>
<i><b>No wallet, nothing,</b></i>
<i><b>which means Interpol
has everything they need.</b></i>
<i><b>So I better figure something out,</b></i>
<i><b>because I'm starting to get hungry.</b></i>
<i><b>So I finally made it to Paris.</b></i>
<i><b>And I managed to find this place
as a shelter.</b></i>
<i><b>It has water</b></i>
<i><b>and power and everything
I could possibly need.</b></i>
<i><b>Except everyone back home
is freaking out</b></i>
<i><b>because Interpol has just
issued warrants for our arrest.</b></i>
<i><b>And now I need to find Audrey</b></i>
<i><b>before they find me.</b></i>
<i><b>I was going through the footage,
and I was just looking for clues.</b></i>
<i><b>I was looking for anything,
just something to help, and...</b></i>
<i><b>Shit, you have to check this out.</b></i>
<i><b>Okay, here we go.</b></i>
<i><b>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</b></i>
<i><b>That's it. That's her cell phone.</b></i>
<i><b>That's Audrey's cell phone.
It's at the hotel.</b></i>
<i><b>I just have to go get it.</b></i>
<i><b>Clif, I've never been so grateful
in my entire life</b></i>
<i><b>that you shoot everything.</b></i>
<i><b>You document everything.</b></i>
<i><b>Thanks.</b></i>
<i><b>I'm really hoping that Audrey's stuff
is still at the hotel.</b></i>
<i><b>Okay, fingers crossed.</b></i>
<i><b>Hi.</b></i>
<i><b>Do you have, like, a lost and found?</b></i>
<i><b>Okay, okay, okay, thanks.</b></i>
<i><b>Thank you. Thank you very much.</b></i>
<i><b>Thank you, thank you, thank you.</b></i>
<i><b>Cilia?'-</b></i>
<i><b>- Jason?
- Derek?</b></i>
<i><b>What are you...?
What are you doing here?</b></i>
<i><b>- Hey, man.
- You can't be...</b></i>
<i><b>Please. I got the cops outside.</b></i>
<i><b>You can't be here.
You can't be around me.</b></i>
<i><b>Like, it's not safe.</b></i>
<i><b>- Gotta come in.
- No, no.</b></i>
<i><b>Please, we can
sort this out together.</b></i>
<i><b>No, you can't be around me, man.</b></i>
<i><b>- It's not safe.
- Please, Derek.</b></i>
<i><b>- You can't be around me!
- No, please!</b></i>
<i><b>Derek, stop!</b></i>
<i><b>Shit.</b></i>
<i><b>Jesus.</b></i>
<i><b>Leave me alone! Leave me alone!</b></i>
<i><b>Stop! Police!</b></i>
<i><b>Oh, shit.</b></i>
<i><b>Oh, no, no, hold on, hold on.</b></i>
<i><b>I don't have you. Just hang on.
Grab my arm! Grab my arm!</b></i>
<i><b>Grab my arm! Grab my--!</b></i>
<i><b>No!</b></i>
<i><b>I'm so sorry.</b></i>
<i><b>It was an accident.</b></i>
<i><b>I tried to save him. I really tried.</b></i>
<i><b>I'm not a murderer.</b></i>
<i><b>Jason.</b></i>
<i><b>I just... I just need more time.</b></i>
<i><b>And then I promise
I will come home.</b></i>
<i><b>I am not sure</b></i>
<i><b>how much longer
I'm gonna be able to hold out.</b></i>
<i><b>But I got her phone.</b></i>
<i><b>This is what's gonna happen. I'll text
all the numbers in this phone</b></i>
<i><b>a message to come meet me.</b></i>
<i><b>Maybe I'll get lucky.</b></i>
<i><b>Call me, you bitch!
You know I have your phone!</b></i>
<i><b>I've been posting online.
I gave you my fucking e-mail.</b></i>
<i><b>You can contact me.
I know you can, so just do it!</b></i>
<i><b>Just do it!</b></i>
<i><b>I finally got a text.</b></i>
<i><b>And if this doesn't work...</b></i>
<i><b>...I'm so screwed.</b></i>
<i><b>Audrey?</b></i>
<i><b>I got you.</b></i>
<i><b>I got you.</b></i>
<i><b>Audrey.</b></i>
<i><b>Cilia?'-</b></i>
<i><b>Okay, welcome to an
"Ends of the Earth"</b></i>
<i><b>live-streaming event.</b></i>
<i><b>Tonight we have a very special guest
in Maurice Behar.</b></i>
<i><b>Now, Maurice here is 56 years old,</b></i>
<i><b>living right here in Paris,</b></i>
<i><b>and he has a very unusual pastime.</b></i>
<i><b>Now, what the fuck
are you doing with this, Maurice?</b></i>
<i><b>It is covered in blood.</b></i>
<i><b>All right, Audrey, here it is.</b></i>
<i><b>I have your fucking plaything.</b></i>
<i><b>It's been about two weeks,
so I tell you what,</b></i>
<i><b>I'm gonna stay right here
until either you show up</b></i>
<i><b>or I can't hold out any longer.</b></i>
<i><b>So where is she, Maurice?</b></i>
<i><b>Where's Audrey? I know
you know where she is. Look at...</b></i>
<i><b>Jesus.</b></i>
<i><b>Fifty years,
and you are the first one she's turned.</b></i>
<i><b>What?</b></i>
<i><b>What are you talking about?</b></i>
<i><b>I mean, who are you?</b></i>
<i><b>You have to run now.</b></i>
<i><b>What?</b></i>
<i><b>You have no time.</b></i>
<i><b>- She will come.
- Good. Good. I want her to come.</b></i>
<i><b>You know what?</b></i>
<i><b>Just kill me,</b></i>
<i><b>you ungrateful little shit.</b></i>
<i><b>I can't believe she give this to you.</b></i>
<i><b>Jesus.</b></i>
<i><b>Get off me! Get off me!</b></i>
<i><b>No, no, no!</b></i>
<i><b>No, no, no!</b></i>
<i><b>Wait. Wait.</b></i>
<i><b>Please.</b></i>
<i><b>Don't come near me
or Maurice ever again.</b></i>
<i><b>What?</b></i>
<i><b>What are you looking at?</b></i>
<i><b>You're not feeding enough.</b></i>
<i><b>What the hell's that
supposed to mean?</b></i>
<i><b>Please, you have to help me.</b></i>
<i><b>Listen to me.</b></i>
<i><b>You must eat.</b></i>
<i><b>- Your body will not let you starve.
- Are you insane? You want-l?</b></i>
<i><b>I can't keep killing people.</b></i>
<i><b>You have to be able to fix this.
You have to have a cure.</b></i>
<i><b>- A cure?
- Yes, a cure.</b></i>
<i><b>This isn't a disease.</b></i>
<i><b>There is no cure. You must kill.</b></i>
<i><b>Fine. I'm gonna kill you.</b></i>
<i><b>You don't get it!</b></i>
<i><b>You can't kill me!</b></i>
<i><b>Do it.</b></i>
<i><b>Please.</b></i>
<i><b>Kill me.</b></i>
<i><b>Kill me.</b></i>
<i><b>Don't you think
I would have cured myself</b></i>
<i><b>if there was such a thing?</b></i>
<i><b>Don't you think I would have
ended my life if I could?</b></i>
<i><b>You were a mistake.</b></i>
<i><b>I will never create another.</b></i>
<i><b>I can't... I can't kill someone
every ten days.</b></i>
<i><b>- I can't.
- Ten days'?</b></i>
<i><b>Your eyes are changing already.</b></i>
<i><b>You need to be feeding
every four to five days.</b></i>
<i><b>No. No.</b></i>
<i><b>If you do not choose to feed,
you will become something worse.</b></i>
<i><b>You will lose control.
You will kill every day.</b></i>
<i><b>Every single day.</b></i>
<i><b>And you will not stop.</b></i>
<i><b>No, no, no.</b></i>
<i><b>You can't choose not to kill.</b></i>
<i><b>But you can choose who you kill.</b></i>
<i><b>It makes a difference.</b></i>
<i><b>So why did you choose me?</b></i>
<i><b>You were dying.</b></i>
<i><b>I thought I was being kind.</b></i>
<i><b>Mom, Dad, Jason.</b></i>
<i><b>I know you haven't heard from me
in a while.</b></i>
<i><b>I needed time to figure this out.</b></i>
<i><b>I hope seeing this helps you
to understand what happened.</b></i>
<i><b>I just want you to know
that I love you.</b></i>
<i><b>And I am very sorry for everything
that I've put you through.</b></i>
<i><b>But look.</b></i>
<i><b>If Audrey is right and I can't die,</b></i>
<i><b>then what I am
and the things I have to do,</b></i>
<i><b>you can't be around.</b></i>
<i><b>It's not safe.</b></i>
<i><b>I'm not the person you remember.</b></i>
<i><b>Hello'?</b></i>
<i><b>Look, whoever you are,</b></i>
<i><b>please, don't hurt me.</b></i>
<i><b>What? What? No. Please.</b></i>
<i><b>Let me go. I won't tell anyone.</b></i>
<i><b>Please. Why are you doing this?</b></i>
<i><b>Is this your phone?</b></i>
<i><b>Is this your phone?</b></i>
<i><b>That's what I thought.</b></i>
<i><b>Wait. Wait.</b></i>
<i><b>What are you going to do?</b></i>
<i><b>I don't know.</b></i>
<i><b>But I'm gonna give you the same
chance you gave that little girl.</b></i>
<i><b>- What are you doing with the camera?
- I'm looking for the light.</b></i>
<i><b>Just don't put it on the Internet.</b></i>
<i><b>So, what are we doing here?</b></i>
<i><b>We are gonna make your first night
in Italy a memorable one.</b></i>
<i><b>Come on, it'll be fun.</b></i>
<i><b>- All the lights are off.
- Okay.</b></i>
<i><b>Nobody's home.</b></i>
<i><b>- Where's Chiara?
- What?</b></i>
<i><b>- Where is she?
- What the fuck?</b></i>
<i><b>- Chiara!
- Dina, calm down.</b></i>
<i><b>- Chiara!
- Dina, we'll find her.</b></i>
<i><b>Din--!</b></i>
<i><b>Oh, God. Oh, my God.</b></i>
<i><b>Oh, my..</b></i>
<i><b>What the fuck? What the--?
What the fuck is that?</b></i>
<i><b>Oh, shit. Oh, shit.</b></i>
<i><b>What the fuck?</b></i>
<i><b>Fuck!</b></i>
