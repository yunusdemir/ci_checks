Ichabod and Mr Toad
Ichabod
Ichabod and Mr Toad
Ichabod, Ichabod and Mr Toad...
If You were asked to choose the most fabulous
character in English literature,
Who would it be?
Robin Hood?
King Arthur?
Becky Sharp?
Sherlock Holmes?
Oliver Twist, perhaps.
Well, anyone of them would be an excellent choice.
Still, for the most fabulous character
of all,
I would nominate... a toad.
J Thaddeus Toad, Esquire.
Have you never met him?
You will find his story
in this delightful little book...
The Wind In The Willows.
Toad, you might say,
was the one disturbing element...
Incurable adventurer, mad, reckless,
tried everything.,
a positive mania for fads,
and he never counted
the cost.
He had a host
of fair-weather friends, of course.
But there were only three
who had his best interests at heart.
One was a badger. MacBadger.
And then there was a water rat...
A bit stuffy, perhaps,
but really a fine fellow.
And a mole... gentle creature,
kind and sympathetic.
They all made their homes in
a quaint community along a riverbank.
On that particular day,
Mole was in a hurry because...
Oh, yes, of course
...because he was late for tea.
A regrettable habit, still
Rat had learned to put up with it.
As usual - Sorry, Rat, says Mole.
Quite alright, says Rat.
"Two lumps, if you please?"
Then, just as
they were getting comfortably settled...
Oh?
- Special Delivery, Mr Rat.
- Thank you, Postman.
- How's everything on the river today, sir?.
Dashed quiet, as usual,
thank you.
Hmm. Mole,
listen to this.
''Dear Rat: You and Mole
must come to Toad Hall at once.
Urgent!! A MacBadger.''
Rat was certain Toad
was making trouble again.
Well, the answer to that lay
just around the bend,
at Toad Hall, the ancestral home
of J Thaddeus himself.
This impressive structure, by the way
was the finest home on the river.
The animals
were tremendously proud of it.
They felt it gave the whole community
an air of respectability.
To lose Toad Hall was,
of course, unthinkable,
and yet it was no secret
that Toad's costly follies
had brought him
to the brink of bankruptcy.
So, as the last result, MacBadger had volunteered...
to take over and put Toad's house in order.
- Smashed fence.
- Two guineas.
- Damage, lamp post.
four pound six.
- Destruction of hen house...
How can a man figure
with all this hubbub?.
- I'll not be put off!
- Pay my bill!
- Silence!
You'll get your money
in due course.
Now, go along with you.
I'll pay no more today.
Why did I assume the responsibility
of looking after...
Didn't I tell you...?.
It's you, Rat. And Mole, too.
Thank goodness, lads.
You've come at last.
Poor MacBadger.
He'd reached the end of his rope.
For, as he said himself...
I'm practically a nervous wreck.
I say, MacBadger! What seems to be the trouble?.
Summat's got to be done about Toad!
This time he's gone too far!
- But he promised us...
- Promises? Ha!
What good are promises
when wild manias take him?.
Now, look,
- you're his
closest friends, are you not?.
- Yes.
- Very dear friends.
- Then lads,
You've got to find toad
and stop him!
- What's he doing?.
- He's got a new mania.
He's rampaging
about the county...
in a canary-yellow gypsy cart....
With a horse named Cyril.
Tally-ho!
Are we on our way to Nottingham,
to Brittingham, to Buckingham
or any hammy hamlet by the sea?
No!.
Are we on our way to Devonshire,
to Lancashire or Worcestershire? I'm not so sure
We'll have to wait and see.
Are we on our way to Dover?
Or going merrily over
The jolly old road that goes to Plymouth,
Ho?
No!. We're merrily, merrily,
merrily, merrily, merrily
on our way to nowhere
in particular
We're merrily, merrily, merrily,
merrily, merrily on our way
Though the roads are perpendicular
- We 're always in a hurry
- We have no time to stall
We 've gotta be there, we 've gotta be there
But where, we can't recall
We're merrily, merrily, merrily,merrily,
merrily on our way
And we may be going to Devonshire,
to Lancashire, to Worcestershire
We're not so sure, but what do we care?
We're only sure
we've got to be there
We're merrily on our way
to nowhere at all
Hello, you fellows!
You're the very animals I was coming to see!
Come along! Hop up!
We'll go for a jolly ride!
The open road,
the dusty highway. Come!
I'll show you the world.
Travel, change, excitement...
- Ha ha ha!
How stupid of me!
I want you fellows
to meet my noble steed,
Cyril.
- Aye
that's me.
A bit of a trotter,
a bit of a rotter.
How do you do? How do you do? How do you do?
How do you do?
Say, guv'nor, your friends seem
a bit on the stuffy side, what?
Toad, we want to have a talk
with you.
Oh, a visit!
- Splendid!
- Toad, this is serious.
You've got to
give up that horse and cart.
Give up my... But my dear Ratty,
this is my career!
- You can't mean...
- I do mean it!
- You must stop this foolishness!
- No.
- You must!
- No. I won't do it.
Your reckless behavior...
is giving animals a bad name!
You're becoming a menace to society.
At least think of poor MacBadger!
And as for that horse,
no good will come of gadding about
with such a fast
and irresponsible beast!
- Get him, Mole!
- Come down, Toady.
- Stop it! Let me go!
- Giddy up, Cyril! Giddy up!
It's no use. You'll never
get me to give this up!
Tally-ho! Yikes!
- Look!
- God! What is it?
- Lummy, guv'nor, it's a motorcar.
- Motorcar?.
A motorcar...
God! What have I been missing?.
- Ratty, it isn't... He hasn't...
- It is, and he has.
A new mania. Motor mania.
Mania.
That's it. That's what it was.
A positive mania.
No telling where it would end, either.
Might linger for months.
And with Toad Hall at stake,
Well, Rat and Mole had no choice.
there's the only one thing to do....
Lock the poor chap up in his chambers and keep him there
until the poison worked out of his system.
- Hold him, Moley!
- That's better.
- And you can't escape.
Simply no use trying.
Let me out of here! Open up, I say!
Please!
Rattey, Moley! Open the door!
Now, playing jailer to one's
dearest friend
wasn't exactly a pleasant situation.
In fact, Moley weaken immediately wanted
to call it quits, but Ratty said no.
Definitely not.
This time they must be firm.
It wasn't just a matter
of saving Toad from himself.
There was MacBadger to consider,
and Toad Hall and all it stood for.
Now, there was only one thing wrong
with Ratty's cure for motor mania...
It didn't work.
You see, Toad was far too clever.
And, at the moment, completely mad.
He was determined to get a motorcar,
even if he had to beg, borrow or...
Toad arrested! Extra!
His Majesty versus
J Thaddeus Toad, Toad Hall, Riverbank,
Doodle-Bunton-
Maxon-Morton, Surrey. 24th day of August,
set forth in the following brief.
Accused is J Thaddeus Toad,
of stealing a motorcar,
and with it, endangering
sundry subjects of His Majesty,
their life and limbs.
- Counsel for the Crown,
proceed with the case.
My lord, I call,
as first Crown witnesses,
Mr Rat and Mr Mole!
Is it true that you had the accused
locked in his own house
because he had threatened to get a motorcar?
- Did you, or did you not,
have him locked up?.
- We did.
- Thank you! That is all!
- Next witness.
- Mr Angus MacBadger!
As trustee of the Toad estate,
you knew of the prisoner's mania
for motorcars?
- Well, I...
- And due to his reckless extravagance,
you cut off his allowance?
- Well, I...
- Then he was, to the best of your
knowledge, without funds?
- Well, I...
- That is all! Thank you!
Gentlemen of the jury,
the Crown rests.
Counsel for the defense
will present his case.
My lord,
with the court's indulgence,
I rise prepared
to plead my own defense.
- Moley!
Stop it.
Gentlemen of the jury,...
..I call, as my first witness, Cyril Proudbottom.
- Cyril Proudbottom.
Are you acquainted with
the defendant, J Thaddeus Toad?.
Lord love a duck, yes!
He's one of
the jolliest chaps l've ever run across.
And simply tons of money.
Good fellow?. Throws it away.
But he wasn't throwing it away
that day!
You heard Mr MacBadger testify
that his allowance was cut off.
Then how did he get a motorcar?
The only way
a gentleman gets anything. The honest way.
- And what is the honest way?
Ha ha! I thought you wouldn't know that, guv'nor!
- Your Lordship, l...
The witness may testify
in his own words.
Righto, guv'nor.
I'll just give you the facts in the case.
When Toady escaped from his boudoir
he headed
straight for my place.
Soon we was off down the highway,
but we hadn't gone far, I confess,
when, with a rush and a roar,...
..something passed
like the London Express.
It was big, it was red,
it was beautiful.
A motorcar, a bit of alright.
Toady was transfixed
with... rapture.
You could tell
it was love at first sight.
The motor pulled up to a tavern,
wherein was located a bar.
- And we watched
while some tough-looking weasels
got out of that lovely red car.
Now, weasels, I know, are deceitful.
And not to be trusted, at all.
But how could I know
they'd stolen that car?
I didn't have no crystal ball.
The guv'nor is not one to dally.
He made up his mind like a flash.
He says...
Try it for size, my good Cyril,
while I see
what they'll take for it, cash.
Into the tavern he saunters,
where he barman was back of the bar.
And he said,
- Cheerio, tavern keeper.
Who's the owner of that...
hot-looking car?
The barman, a codger named Winky,
leaned over the bar and said,
- Why?
The guv'nor answered,
- That car must be mine!
Whatever the price is, l'll buy.
But Toad found he hadn't no money.
So, he promptly offered a trade.
The weasels appeared
to be willing.
In a moment,
the bargain was made.
Then Toady drawed up a paper,
with almost incredible speed.
And he called
on old Winky the barman
to... pop over and witness the deed.
Now, the guv'nor is not a bit stingy.
He never does anything small.
The weasels
gave him the red motorcar,
and he gave the weasels Toad Hall.
Ohhh!
Hmm.
Traded Toad Hall?
An estate worth $1 00,000
for a motorcar?.
Ha! Ha-ha.
You expect me to believe that?
I don't expect you
to believe anything.
But fortunately, I can produce a witness.
Call Mr Winky!
Mr Winky, Mr Winky!
My lord, gentlemen,
facing you in the witness box is a citizen
of substance and standing.
A man of unimpeachable honesty.
Now, Mr Winky,
do you recall
an incident that took place in your...
establishment
last August 12th,
that I was a party to?.
Yes, sir, that I do, sir.
Well, then,...
just tell the court
what actually happened.
Well, guv'nor,
you tried to sell me
a stolen motorcar.
That's a deliberate lie,
you monkey-faced rum pot!
No. No!
I've been framed! Let me go!
Help! Help!
Toad guilty!
Toad's disgrace rocked the nation.
Seems the court was determined
to make an example of him.
Couse Toad's friends tried to help him,
but they were blocked at every term.
While they must've reopened the case
at least a dozen times.
Appeals to this court, that court
any court.
But the decision stood.
The case of J Thaddeus Toad
was closed.
Merry, merry Christmas time
The case of J Thaddeus Toad
was closed.
Merry, merry Christmas time
Bind every heart with happiness
Let everyone...
Yes, once again,
it was a white Christmas.
Let everyone...
Yes, once again,
it was a white Christmas.
And one again melodies of Yuletide hung sweet
upon the winter's air.
Hearts were gay and spirits high.
Indeed, in all the city,
there was but one spot untouched
by the warmth of Christmas cheer.
The Tower,
grim monument to despair.
Cold, cruel, forbidding,
and unfortunately, the abode of Toad
for a good many Christmases yet to come.
Poor Toad. Alone with memories
of his wasted life.
What a fool he'd been!
With many a pang he recalled
the kindly face of Angus MacBadger,
and his sage advice,
so often scorned.
A tear for Moley, too,
for his
loyalty, his sympathy,
his understanding.
Toad wept for Rat, and all those
little lectures so often laughed at.
Yes, within the dark confines
of his miserable cell,
a new Toad was born.
A reformed Toad, a repentant Toad.
In a flood of remorse,
he vowed once and for all
to forsake the follies of the Primrose path.
Never, never again would he give way
to those mad, foolish manias
that had brought him
to this sorry end.
As it's Christmas,
you're allowed a visitor.
- Your grandma's here.
- Grandma?.
Merry Christmas, sonny!
Granny wouldn't forget
her little Toady boy!
- Cyrile!
Oh. Cyrile.
Look, Christmas gift.
- What is it?
- Don't you get it?
A disguise.
All you've got to do is put on this
natty little costume and...
Alas for good intentions.
Toad was incurable.
One whispered word
and all his high resolve
vanished in the mad whirl
of this new adventure....
This new mania! Escape!
Toad's escaped!
Halt!
Oh, Good evening, ma'am.
Good evening to you, Officer. We're merrily, merrily, merrily...
Begging your pardon, but you...
Hey!
You fellows, over there, do you see him?
God, what perfectly ripping luck!
Trap Toad, would they?
Never!
- There he goes!
- Where?
Over there!
Blockheads!
Let them scour the countryside.
Once more, J Thaddeus Toad
had the last laugh.
Ha-ha-ha!
That Christmas Eve,
along the riverbank,
the name of Toad was banned
from conversation,
lest the memory of his disgrace
becloud the merriment of the season.
Yet there was one home, at least,
in which two loyal hearts
still held the warmth of Christian charity
Bless this good food
we are about to enjoy.
Bless us, every one.
And... bless poor Toad.
And may he get time off
for good behavior.
Why, it's a poor old lady.
Let's take her over by the fire.
Oh!
- Toad!
- Toad!
What are you doing here?.
I was just sort of...
Well, this is a merry Christmas!
But... aren't you afraid
of the police?
Afraid of the police?
Ha-ha-ha.
I, Toad, afraid of the police?
- Open up, I say!
- The police!
Hide me, Ratty!
Sorry, toad, but you owe
a debt to society.
And you've got to pay.
Mole, let them in.
But, Ratty, don't you think, maybe...
Open the door!
- MacBadger!
- Hi, lads!
I've just made
a very important discovery.
Toad Hall is ablaze with lights
and in possession
of a pack of weasels.
And the leader of the gang
is none other than Mr...
Winky!
Hip, hip...
Hooray!
And so, you see,
he did trade Toad Hall
for the motorcar!
- Then, Toad was innocent all the time.
- Aye, lads.
And if he were only here right now...
- Toad!
- Angus!
Sorry, Toad, I misjudged you.
I hope, someday,
you'll find it in your heart...
Not another word.
To err is human, to forgive...
Not so fast!
You're still guilty
in the eyes of the law.
To prove your innocence, we've got
to get that paper away from Winky!
Now, I have a plan.
We'll sneak in
through the secret tunnel.
It was an expert plan, cunningly
contrived but extremely dangerous.
It would work only if each did his
part.
There was no margin for error.
The odds against them were tremendous,
but the stakes were high.
But now, steady's the word...
One false move
and four lives hang in the balance.
Careful, lads. There is a guard.
- l'll pop him off!
-Stop! Don't shoot!
Who goes there?
That was a close one.
Trust Toad to start things off
on the wrong foot.
Well, no turning back now.
Nothing for it but to push on.
What new and greater perils
lay ahead, no one could say.
Toad had already got out of hand,
so anything could happen.
Look. They're all asleep.
Lads, they're drunk.
They've been hitting the bottle.
But where is Winky?
There he is!
He's got the paper on him!
We'll have
to climb up on the balcony.
The paper! It's gone!
Get him, you blokes! Get him!
I beg your pardon!
Moley!
Moley! Over here!
Get him!
- After it!
- Ha-ha-ha! Just one more!
- There he is! Get him!
Where's Moley?
Well, laddies, we saved our skins,
but we didn't get the deed.
- Well done!
Hip, hip, hooray!
So, it was a happy ending, after all.
Of course, Toad's friends were dreadfully proud
of him. And why not?
He was a new Toad,
completely reformed,
through with gypsy carts
and motorcars for ever.
And so, on this happiest of
New Years, a toast was in order.
- To the New Year and...
- To the new Toad!
- Hello, you fellows!
Come! I'll show you the world.
Travel, change,
excitement...! Ha-ha-ha!
That was the fabulous
Thaddeus Toad.
But let's weigh
our judgement carefully,we Moles and Rats and Badgers.
Don't we envy him a bit?
I know I do.
When we speak
of fabulous characters,
the most fabulous will always be,
to me, at least,
the master of Toad Hall.
Yes! J Thaddeus was quite a lad!
Speaking of fabulous characters,
England has produced a bumper crop of it.
But over here in the colonies,
we've manage to come up for a few of our own.
About Paul Bunyan, Pecos Bill,
Johnny Appleseed,
Black Bart, Davy Crockett,
Daniel Boone.
And, of course,
the one and only Ichabod Crane.
Oh, Ichy, if you are called, was the country schoolmaster
dreamed up
by Washington Irving.
He had a way with a yarn
did Mr Irving.
If we could but journey back
to that remote period in  American history
when Manhattan
was but a market town,
we would discover, in one of that specious coves
which indent the shores
of the Hudson,
the little village of Tarry Town.
And just beyond, nestled deep
in the low rolling hills,
a sequestered glen.
It's a quiet, peaceful place,
and yet, somehow... foreboding.
It abounds in haunted spots,
twilight tales, and local superstitions.
The best-known story, however concerns
an itinerant schoolmaster
who once frequented these parts.
Indeed some say his melancholy spirit
still haunts the vicinity.
The pedagogue was described
as a most unusual man.
To see him striding along,
one might well mistake him for a
scarecrow eloped from a cornfield.
He was tall, but exceedingly lank.
His head was small and flat on top,
with a long, snipe nose.
For it looked like a weathercock
perched upon his spindle neck.
altogether, he was an apparition
seldom to be seen in broad daylight.
This late one drowsy autumn afternoon,
when this strange figure
first approached
the frankful little village, Sleepy Hollow.
As usual, there had gathered
at Ye Olde Schnooker and Schnapps Shoppe
a group of rustic lads,
known as the Sleepy Hollow boys.
Ya-hoo!
Their self-appointed leader,
Brom Bones,
was a burly, roistering blade,
always ready for a fight or a frolic.
Though Brom was given
to madcap pranks and practical jokes,
there was no malice in his mischief.
Indeed, with his waggish humor
and prodigious strength,
Brom Bones was quite the hero,
all the country round.
Odds bodkins! Gadzooks!
Look at that old spook of spooks.
# Who's that coming down the street? #
# Are they shovels or are they feet? #
# Lean and lanky, Skin and bone #
# But with clothes a scarecrow
would hate to own #
# Yet, he has a certain air #
# Debonair and devil-may-care #
- It's the new schoolmaster
- What's his name?
Ichabod
Ichabod Crane
Ichabod, What a name!
Kind of odd, but nice just the same
Funny pan, funny frame,
Ichabod, Ichabod Crane
Ichabod may be quaint
May be odd, and maybe he ain't
Anyway, there's no complaint
From Ichabod, Ichabod Crane...
Although the arrival of the pedagogue
gave rise to mixed emotions,
the towns people all agreed
they'd never seen anyone
...# like Ichabod, Ichabod Crane... #
The school room
became Ichabod's empire...
over which, with lordly dignity,
he held absolute sway.
Truth to say, Ichabod
was a conscientious man,
and ever bore in mind the maxim
spare the rod and spoil the child.
Still, he was careful to administer justice,
with discrimination.
For it behooved him to keep
on good terms with his pupils.
Especially if their mothers
happened to be good cooks.
# Who's the town's ladies' man? #
# Gets around like nobody can #
# Has to be none other than... #
# Ichabod
Ichabod Crane #
Thus, as time went by,
it may be seen that the pedagogue
got on tolerably enough.
Moreover, Ichabod found ways
to increase his slender income
and, at the same time, awaken the cultural interests
of the sleepy little village.
It was inevitable
that a man like Ichabod
would become an object
of ridicule
to Brom Bones and his gang.
Yet, to Ichabod,
these were small matters.
Indeed, the schoolmaster possessed
a remarkable equanimity
which remained
quite undisturbed until...
that fateful day...
when his path was crossed
by a woman...
A certain woman,
Katrina van Tassel,
daughter and the only child
of old Baltus van Tassel,
the richest farmer in the country.
She was a blooming lass...
plump as a partridge.
Ripe, melting.
and rosy-cheeked.
Once you have met
that little coquette Katrina
You won't forget Katrina
But nobody yet
has ever upset Katrina
That cute coquette Katrina
You can do more
with Margaret or Helena
That cute coquette Katrina
That cute coquette Katrina
Or Anne or Angelina
That cute coquette Katrina
But Katrina will kiss and run
Or Anne or Angelina
That cute coquette Katrina
But Katrina will kiss and run
That cute coquette Katrina
That cute coquette Katrina
To her, a romance is fun
That cute coquette Katrina
That cute coquette Katrina
With always another one to start
That cute coquette Katrina
That cute coquette Katrina
And yet when you've met
that little coquette Katrina
That cute coquette Katrina
You've lost your heart
And yet when you've met
that little coquette Katrina
That cute coquette Katrina
You've lost your heart
That cute coquette Katrina
That cute coquette Katrina
Now, there was no doubt
that fair Katrina...
was the richest price
in the countryside.
And the schoolmaster,
being an ambitious man,
at once began to fill his mind
with many sugared thoughts
and hopeful suppositions.
Ah, Katrina, my love.
Who can resist your grace,
your charm?
And who can resist
your father's farm?
Boy, what a set-up!
There's gold in them acres,
and that ain't hay.
Not to mention
that lovely green stuff.
Ah, Katrina,
my sweet, my treasure.
Treasure. Ah-ha-ha,
That barn's a gold mine.
How I'd love to hit the jackpot.
Dear Katrina,
Papa's only child...
Papa?
The old goat can't take it with him.
When he cuts out,
that's where I cut in.
Sweet Kathrina,
poor little rich girl.
Don't worry, Katie,
Ichabod will protect you.
Ah, yes, Kathrina, you've won me.
I surrender.
And yet when you've met
that little coquette Katrina
You've lost your heart
Truth to say, every part of the Kathrina's heart
was jealously guarded
by a host of rustic admirers.
A-ha-ha but Ichabod was confident.
he'd soon ride roughshod
over these simple country bumpkins.
But the most formidable obstacle however
the schoolmaster had failed to reckon with.
That was the redoubtable
Brom Bones himself.
The ease with which Brom cleared the field of rivals
both piqued and provoked the fair Katrina.
And she often wished that
some champion would appear for once
and take the field openly
against the boisterous Brom.
A wiser man would have shrunk
from the competition,
but love is blind.
Ichabod was aware only that Dame Fortune
was at last thundering at his door.
It's true that Brom liked a joke
as well as the next,
but enough was too much.
It was time for open warfare.
He'd double that schoolmaster up
and lay him on a shelf
in his schoolhouse!
But this was easier said than done.
ya-hoo!
No doubt,
this was the Ichabod lucky day.
It was evident, the schoolmaster
was a man of hidden talents,
a rival to be reckoned with.
Still, wars are neither won nor lost
at the first encounter.
The high-flyer
might yet be brought to earth.
For Brom Bones
was never a man to cry quits.
On the occasion of her father's
annual Halloween frolic,
Katrina again chose to stir the embers
of the smoldering rivalry.
Thus, one invitation in particular
carried a most personal and provocative summons.
The worthy schoolmaster
was in a transport of joy.
To him,
this could mean but one thing.
Ichy, you sly old dog, you!
What is this strange power
you have over women?
Well, tonight's the night, boy!
Just turn on the old charm.
The fair Katrina is yours for the asking.
So gaily bedecked and nobly mounted
on a horse he had borrowed to the occasion,
Ichabod issued forth
like a knight errant of old
to keep a tryst with his lady fair.
In all the countryside, there was
nothing to equal the merrymaking
at Mynheer Van Tassel's farm.
To Ichabod, here was
a perfect field for his endeavors.
How, indeed, would he put
his best foot forward!
Beyond all his other talents,
the schoolmaster prided himself upon his dancing.
Unhappy Brom,
already bested at every turn,
saw himself once more outmatched.
For as he watched
the posturing pedagogue,
he was forced to admit
that here...
here was a flawless picture
of ease and grace.
Ya-hoo!
There was no doubt that Ichabod
was the man of the hour.
Brom knew that he must concede
his rival still another victory.
And yet there was still a chance
that his time would,
for when the hour grew late,
Van Tassel always called upon his guests
to tell him ghostly tales of Halloween.
And Brom knew there was no more firm,
potent believer in spooks and goblins
than Ichabod Crane.
Just gather round and l'll elucidate
what goes on outside,
when it gets late.
# Around about midnight,
the ghosts and banshees #
# get together for nightly jamborees. #
# Things with horns and saucer eyes, #
# and some with fangs about this size! #
# - Some are fat.
- And some are thin! #
# And some don't even wear their skin! #
# I'm telling you, brother, it's a frightful sight
# to see what goes on, Halloween night. #
# When spooks
have a midnight jamboree #
# They break it up with fiendish glee #
# Ghosts are bad,
but the one that's cursed #
# Is the Headless Horseman,
he's the worst #
# That's right,
he's a fright on Halloween night #
# When he goes a-joggin'
across the land #
# Holdin' his noggin in his hand #
# Demons take one look and groan #
# And hit the road for parts unknown #
# Beware, take care, he rides alone #
# And there's no spook
like a spook who's spurned #
# They don't like him
and he's really burned #
# He swears
to the longest day he's dead #
# He'll show them
that he can get ahead #
# They say he's tired
of his flamin' top #
# He's got a yen to make a swap #
# So he rides one night each year #
# To find a head in the hollow here #
# Now, he likes them little,
he likes them big #
# Part in the middle, or a wig #
# Black or white, or even red #
# The Headless Horseman needs a head
With a hip-hip and a clippity-clop #
# He's out lookin' for a top to chop #
# So don't stop to figure out a plan #
# You can't reason
with a headless man #
# Now, if you doubt this tale is so, #
# I met that spook just a year ago. #
# Now, I didn't stop
for a second look, #
# but made for the bridge
that spans the brook. #
# For once you cross that bridge,
my friends #
# The ghost is through,
his power ends #
# So, when you're riding home tonight #
# Make for the bridge
with all your might #
# He'll be down in the hollow there #
# He needs your head. Look out! Beware!
With a hip-hip and a clippity-clop #
# He's out lookin' for a head to swap #
# So don't try to figure out a plan #
# You can't reason
with a headless man #
It was the witching hour of night
as Ichabod pursued his travel home.
The sky grew darker and darker
as one by one, the stars winked out their lights.
Driving clouds
obscured the moon from sight.
Never had the schoolmaster
felt so melancholy,
so utterly alone.
The nearer he approached
the hollow,
the more dismal he became.
Once inside the murky glen, Ichabod's
anxiety increased one-hundredfold.
The forest seemed
to close in behind him.
Every small detail
of Brom's awful story
returned to haunt his recollection.
Ichabod, Ichabod.
Headless Horseman.
Headless Horseman.
Headless Horseman.
Headless Horseman.
Headless Horseman. Headless Horseman...
Horseman, Horseman...
Be aware, be aware...!
Once you cross that bridge,
my friends,
the ghost is through,
his power ends.
Next morning,
Ichabod's hat was found.
And close beside it,
a shattered pumpkin.
But there was no trace
of the schoolmaster.
Shortly thereafter, Brom Bones
led the fair Katrina to the altar.
Now, rumors persisted
that Ichabod was still alive,
married to a wealthy widow
in a distant county.
But the good Dutch settlers
refused to believe such nonsense.
They knew the schoolmaster had been
spirited away by the headless horseman.
With a hip-hip and a clippity-clop
He's out looking for a head to swap
But don't try to figure out a plan
You can't reason with a headless man
Man, I'm getting out of here!
