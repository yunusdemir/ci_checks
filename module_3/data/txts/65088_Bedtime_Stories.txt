<i>[man] I'm going</i>
<i>to tell you a story now.</i>
<i>But as any good storyteller knows,</i>
<i>one must first be sure</i>
<i>the audience is prepared.</i>
<i>Is everybody comfortably seated?</i>
<i>Does anyone need to use the bathroom?</i>
<i>Oh. You, sir, in the back?</i>
<i>Well, hold it in.</i>
<i>[laughs]</i>
<i>You ready? Here we go.</i>
<i>My name is Marty Bronson.</i>
<i>I owned and operated</i>
<i>the Sunny Vista Motel,</i>
<i>which I established on the corner</i>
<i>of Sunset and La Cienega Boulevards</i>
<i>in Los Angeles, California,</i>
<i>in the year 197 4.</i>
<i>The motel was my labor of love,</i>
<i>and I ran it with the help</i>
<i>of my children: Wendy...</i>
[Marty] Wendy, the key, pIease,
for Mr. and Mrs. Dixon.
Thank you.
<i>And Skeeter.</i>
May I heIp you with your bags,
Mr. and Mrs. Dixon?
- Yes, pIease.
- Why, thank you, young man.
[grunting]
You, uh, need a hand?
No, no. I got it.
[Mr. Dixon] OK.
<i>To my boy Skeeter,</i>
<i>the motel was a wonderland.</i>
Way too hyper.
The gaIaxy's not big enough
for the both of us.
<i>A magical place.</i>
[chatter, Iaughter]
<i>Full of new adventures</i>
<i>for a six-year-old boy.</i>
[Iaughs] Oh, Skeeter. Come here.
<i>Skeeter loved the old place</i>
<i>as much as I did.</i>
<i>And he always tried to come up</i>
<i>with ways to make it even beter.</i>
I've got a Iot of ideas how
to improve things around here.
I was thinking we couId put
an extra pair of socks in each room
because peopIe aIways forget to pack
enough socks when they go on a trip.
That's a good idea.
Time for bed,
I'm meeting with Mr. Nottingham.
Wait, Dad. I'm not even tired.
WeII, how about a bedtime story?
Yay!
Now, once upon a time,
there was a IittIe boy,
and that IittIe boy's name
was Skeeter.
<i>Well, I could tell a prety fair tale</i>
<i>when the muse was with me.</i>
<i>And making my litle boy smile,</i>
<i>now, that was truly magical.</i>
<i>Yeah, I was a prety good dad</i>
<i>and a prety good host.</i>
<i>But unfortunately,</i>
<i>a prety bad businessman.</i>
Can't you read the writing
on the waII, Bronson?
This moteI is sinking in red ink...
and I'm offering you the Iast Iifeboat.
[sighs]
I don't know.
[Nottingham]
I've seen the books, Martin.
If you don't seII to me,
you're going to go bankrupt.
Yes, weII, I...
I'd aIways hoped this pIace
wouId be a home for my chiIdren.
[Nottingham] How about this?
If your boy works hard and shows
some smarts when he grows up,
I'II Iet him run this pIace.
[sighs] You promise?
Yes. Now sign the bIoody papers.
That's my boy, Bronson.
Trust me, I'm going to turn this pIace
into the finest hoteI in Los AngeIes.
It's going to be uptight
and out of sight.
<i>[Marty] And just like that,</i>
<i>our modest litle Sunny Vista Motel...</i>
<i>...metamorphosized into the</i>
<i>mighty Sunny Vista Notingham.</i>
<i>And for the past 25 years,</i>
<i>it has been lovingly maintained</i>
<i>by my now grown-up son,</i>
<i>Skeeter Bronson, the handyman.</i>
<i>Yes, though Mr. Notingham's promise</i>
<i>for Skeeter to run the place</i>
- <i>seems to have been forgoten...</i>
- Hiya, Pop.
<i>...my boy always works diligently</i>
<i>with a hopeful heart,</i>
<i>still waiting for his shot.</i>
Mrs. Dixon?
Is there a probIem with her room?
Nothing you shouId bother
your tiny mind about.
Mrs. Dixon has been taking the nip
bottIes of Iiquor out of her mini-bar,
and doesn't want to pay for it.
I never even touched
that eviI IittIe refrigerator.
I don't drink aIcohoI.
Of course.
There's probabIy a mix-up.
- I saw who took it.
- OK.
He had red hair and a beard.
He was wearing a green suit
with brass buttons.
And he stands about ten inches taII.
So we're taIking about a Ieprechaun?
There you go.
Oh, I didn't know your brother
was in town.
So, um, here's what
I think we shouId do.
Put aII the missing bottIes
on my tab.
Next time you see any Ieprechauns,
we'II teII Aspen.
She's haIf-troII.
I think, troIIs eat
Ieprechauns, am I right?
[scoffs]
She wouId.
<i>[Marty] Today magic is</i>
<i>in the air at the grand hotel,</i>
<i>and the winds of change</i>
<i>are about to blow our story</i>
<i>in a strange new direction.</i>
<i>But what would you expect in a hotel</i>
<i>founded by someone who loved</i>
<i>a good story as much as I?</i>
Time is of the essence here, Skeeter.
Oh, yeah, I know. I just don't want
the big boss man to get eIectrocuted.
Of course.
- You fixed it?
- Let me see here.
- [feedback]
- Yo, yo. Yo, yo.
Check, check. One, two. Come on.
Yeah, yeah. Hear me in the back?
- Whoa, whoa.
- Skeeter.
I say ''Barry,''
you say ''Nottingham.''
- Barry.
- [aII] Nottingham.
- Barry.
- [aII] Nottingham.
<i># Barry had a Notingham</i>
<i># Notingham, Notingham</i>
<i># Barry had a Notingham</i>
<i># Whose beard was</i>
<i>white as snow #</i>
[Iaughs] Come on,
give it up for the big man.
[appIause]
Got them warmed up for you, sir.
- It's good to see you again.
- Germs.
- Germs?
- Uh, Skeeter,
Mr. Nottingham has
deveIoped a fear, uh...
Not a fear, an awareness...
...of germs and
how dangerous they can be
when not properIy... feared, so...
You're doing the right thing.
I didn't shower today.
So, yeah, Iet me get out of here.
[Skeeter] Barry Nottingham, everybody.
- He's briIIiant, him. I Iove this guy.
- [Barry] WeIcome.
As you know, I own 23 hoteIs
from BerIin to Beijing.
But it's no secret that this one,
the Sunny Vista Nottingham,
is my favorite.
However, this is a 20th-century hoteI.
We need something for the 21 st century.
And so, we have decided
to cIose this hoteI
and to buiId a brand-new
Sunny Vista Mega Nottingham.
[appIause]
This wiII be the Iargest hoteI
on the West Coast.
I simpIy don't understand what the fuss
is about. It's just a big buiIding.
Oh, no, no. This is Iike the
future of the hoteI business.
...and a top-secret theme
that wiII bIow your mind.
Yes!
So I'm proud to announce
the new hoteI's generaI manager.
He's been waiting on this
for a Iong time.
We aII know how hard he works,
how inteIIigent he is,
how much this hoteI means to him.
Take a bow, Mr. KendaII Duncan!
Take a bow, KendaII.
- God bIess.
- Boo!
[hissing]
[man] A beautifuI speech, sir.
A beautifuI speech.
I'm so gIad you couId come.
It's great to see you.
Don't touch me.
WeII done, Daddy.
Oh, oh, heIIo there.
Do you know my daughter, VioIet?
OnIy by reputation, sir.
Excuse me?
No, no, not that she has a reputation.
I aIways heard she's very hot.
Not hot as in hot.
Hot, I meant warm...
Warm-hearted.
And she Iikes to go out
and have fun, festive times,
in bars, with a Iot
of different guys, and...
That's the oId VioIet Nottingham.
Before she met me.
Now it's up to me to keep
my pooky-bear out of the spotIight
and nightcIubs and tabIoids.
Isn't that right, sir? [chuckIes]
VioIet's off to her private tennis
Iesson with Roger Federer.
- Oh. AII right, good for you.
- Bye, boys.
Got to say, uh...
...it's gonna be hard for me to see
the hoteI move Iocations Iike this.
WeII, I, I do hope you'II feeI abIe
to come and work with us there.
Big as KendaII wants to make it,
weII, there's going to be a Iot
of Iight buIbs to change.
[snickering]
Someone touched me.
Is there any sanitizer?
There is, sir. Come this way.
I'II get you some.
Can't be too carefuI, KendaII.
[<i>#</i> Ray Anthony and His Orchestra:

Thank you, PrincipaI Duva.
Oh, I'm not a principaI

Hey!
I notice no one's eating
the gIuten-free wheatgrass cake.
Come on. Trust me,
you just got to get past the smeII.
What? The cIown died?
- What's in that bag?
- Oh, chocoIate chip cookie.
- Food!
- [aII kids] Food!
- SIow it down, sIow it down.
- Hey, sissy.
Why do you bring sugary, chemicaI-fiIIed
crud to my house every time you visit?
What? Every time? You haven't
invited me here in four years.
What are you taIking about?
It hasn't been four years.
You were here for
The Fourth of JuIy barbecue
when you punched my husband?
Yes. That was four years ago.
I wanted to give him a wedgie,
but his underwear had hoIes in it.
I knew he'd be your ex-husband.
You shouId be happy.
AII right. Let's not start.
How are the kids handIing
the oId divorce anyways?
They're both kind of off right now.
Bobbi's been reaIIy quiet.
Why don't you go say hi.
I'm gonna pay the donkey guy.
- Is that what stinks in here?
- No, it's the cake.
What did she make, donkey cake?
- [kids Iaugh]
- I smeII manure.
Hey, you guys. Remember me?
UncIe Skeeter.
Man, you got big.
Haven't seen you in a whiIe.
Happy birthday there, Bobbi.
I'm Patrick. She's Bobbi.
Oh, my bad.
Got you a IittIe something.
Happy birthday, Bobbi.
Here you go.
Picked it up at the hoteI.
How's schooI going?
- Skeeter?
- Yeah.
Getting caIIed to the principaI's
office. Look at that.
Have fun with the gifts. And...
Yes, yes.
Shampoo?
And a soap?
Hanger and a toweI.
Do not taIk about schooI with them.
What's going on with the schooI?
- They're cIosing it down.
- No.
- I'm getting Iaid off.
- You?
You're Iike
the cIassic schooI principaI.
I mean, you're, you're scary
and bad with peopIe.
ChiIdren are nervous around you.
That doesn't sound right, but,
I'm just saying, what eIse couId you do?
Maybe, Cuban dictator? Or the bogeyman.
You couId be the bogeyman.
- Anyway...
- What, what?
I've got some interviews
set up in Arizona,
which is kind of what I wanted
to taIk to you about.
Uh-oh.
I need you to watch the kids...
for a week.
No! No, they don't even Iike me!
It's not going to be difficuIt, Skeeter.
My friend JiII
is a teacher at my schooI.
She'II bring the kids in with her
and watch them tiII dinnertime.
AII you gotta do is the night shift.
Why can't your stupid friend do that?
She's got night schooI. Skeeter!
My husband Ieft me.
I'm getting Iaid off.
I, I have to move.
I need your heIp.
So you need me.
This is good.
I'II do it.
But you got to say,
''Skeeter is the cooIest.
I am a nerd.''
''Skeeter's the cooIest.
I'm a nerd?''
Yeah, you are! Whoo!
OK. Hey, you guys.
I'm going to hang out with you
this week. AII right?
Maybe we can go... fishing.
I'd rather you didn't.
Patrick's not a strong swimmer.
OK, we'II stay inside.
How about, uh,
we pIay some poker?
- I can teach you that.
- GambIing? I don't think so.
OK, how about we
just take waIks in the park
- and cataIog pIant species?
- Now you're taIking.
I don't know anything about pIants
except you try to make cakes
out of them!
He Iiked that one.
I'm gonna end with a Iaugh.
Give me some. Huh?
I wasn't gonna hit you.
I was trying to do the fist thing.
You don't know the fist thing?
OK, I was just...
That's what, uh, the chiIdren do.
Hey, yeh, yeh.
Oh, this your truck, chief?
Yes, it is, ma'am.
You reaIize you're taking up
two parking spaces?
It's a big truck, ma'am.
It's not that big, sir.
You couId fit into one spot.
I had to park
aII the way down the bIock.
WeII, next time park in that box.
PIenty of room in there.
Anyway, here's the situation.
This is not reaIIy my truck,
this is the hoteI I work for's truck.
So if I get a scratch on it,
they take it out of my saIary.
So two parking spaces
provides me with what I caII
''a cushion of protection.''
Wait, a hoteI? Oh, wait.
You're Wendy's brother.
- Yeah.
- I'm JiII.
- Who's that?
- I'm her friend,
the one heIping take care of the kids.
I'm the day shift.
OK, June. You pIan on being
this hostiIe the whoIe time?
JiII. My name is JiII.
Do you pIan on keeping that
haircut the rest of the time?
Oh, haven't you heard?
Goofy's the new handsome.
[engine spIutters]
- That sounds good for the environment.
- Oh, we can't aII have Priuses.
How do you know I drive a Prius?
Your whoIe aura reads Prius.
[bubbIing sounds]
Anyways, you're in my
cushion of protection right now.
I want to back up, so if you
couId just zing-zang up there,
- that wouId be heIpfuI.
- Yeah.
You might want some Cinnabons.
You'II need it.
- Food!
- [kids shouting]
Give it back!
Somebody owes me six bucks!
So why didn't you demand that he make
you the big boss of the new hoteI?
He promised your dad.
I wanted to.
It just wasn't the right time.
Let me teII you how it works.
The big man's giving the job
to KendaII
because he's dating his daughter.
That's the way it works,
keep it in the famiIy.
He gets the girI, he gets the job,
he gets everything.
And I get nothing.
<i>[cell phone ringing]</i>
<i>[ringtone screeches]</i>
- HeIIo?
- <i>[Jill] Where are you? Still there?</i>
I'm stiII where?
Who's this?
<i>Look, I've got to get to class.</i>
<i>The kids are waiting for you, OK?</i>
Oh! Oh, yeah, yeah,
I'm sorry.
[stammers] I forgot.
I'II be there in Iike 20 minutes.
[phone beeps off]
I'm gonna baby-sit
my nephew and niece tonight.
Oh, God.
Got any advice for me?
Yes, I do. Sometimes I baby-sit
my cousins, right?
And what I do is
I Iet them styIe me hair.
Like put beads into it and braid it,
make me Iook aII reaI sexy.
Like MiIIi VaniIIi, stuff Iike that.
You shouId try that.
Braid my hair? That's a good idea.
Can I have some French fries?
Of course you can.
You're my best friend.
[gasps]
Ah! ActuaIIy, I reaIIy Iike
ketchup on my face
because it's
rejuvenating for the skin.
So who's the reaI victim?
You are.
Mmm! DeIicious.
Do you think these signs wiII heIp?
WeII, miracIes happen,
you know?
You mean Iike Dad coming back?
Um...
- [door cIoses]
- [Skeeter singing]
[Iaughing] Hey!
Sorry I'm Iate.
So, um, their pajamas
are on their beds,
and I wiII be back, um,
at 8:30 to pick them up, OK?
- AII right.
- Here is my ceII phone number.
And caII me if there's
any emergencies.
AII right. Have fun at night schooI.
- [JiII] Bye, guys.
- Bye.
AII packed up here.
I got my, uh, toothbrush
and, uh, and the toothpaste.
Some cIean underwear.
WeII, maybe not that cIean.
You guys want to watch TV?
We don't have a TV.
[ceII phone rings]
- HeIIo?
- <i>[Skeeter] Emergency!</i>
They don't have a TV.
Wendy doesn't Iet them watch TV.
You didn't know?
I don't know a Iot of things
about these kids.
I wasn't aIIowed over here.
Their oId man didn't Iike me.
OK, Iisten, you don't need a TV.
You can, um, pIay a game, do a puzzIe.
I'm sure you can figure
something out. OK?
Whoa, whoa, whoa! ShouId I Iet them
braid my hair or something?
WouId they Iike that?
I don't think anyone
shouId touch that hair.
Hey, what do you say we go...
next door and toiIet paper
your neighbor's trees?
No? OK, bedtime!
[thunder, rain faIIing]
OK, so you guys cooI?
You have to read us a bedtime story.
Yeah, aII right. You have any?
Whoo! What do you got here, anyways?
<i>''Rainbow Alligator Saves the Wetlands''?</i>
Mmm, no.
<i>''The Organic Squirrel</i>
<i>Gets a Bike Helmet''?</i>
I'm not reading these
communist books to you guys.
Don't you got any reaI stories?
- Like what?
- Like what?
Like, Iike cowboys? Or dragons?
Or aIiens? Or... What the heck
is on my head right now?
That's Bugsy, our guinea pig.
- Why do you caII him Bugsy?
- Because of his eyes.
Let me see them.
[squeaking]
Wow! Those eyes wouId be big on a cow.
[squeaking]
Are those eyebaIIs
or bowIing baIIs?
Can't keep my eyes off of them.
Just get in there so I don't have to
Iook at them anymore. Goodbye.
Anyways, uh,
you guys want me to, uh,
make up a story for you?
Like, Iike my oId man used to do for me?
Maybe I couId be good at this.
AII right, um...
Here goes.
Once upon a time,
in a magicaI, faraway kingdom...
Once upon a time,
in a magicaI, faraway kingdom...
<i>...there was a brave</i>
<i>and noble knight.</i>
<i>Strikingly handsome.</i>
<i>Who lived in a grand castle</i>
<i>that weary travelers from near and far</i>
<i>would come and visit.</i>
<i>Now, this knight had been</i>
<i>working his but off for years.</i>
<i>You'd think he'd be a shoo-in</i>
<i>to rule the castle, right?</i>
- <i>[Patrick] Right.</i>
- <i>[Skeeter] Wrong.</i>
<i>Actually, he wasn't</i>
<i>even a knight at all.</i>
[neighs]
Oh, no.
<i>[Skeeter] He was, in fact,</i>
<i>just a lowly peasant.</i>
<i>And even though he was the son</i>
<i>of the late, great Lord Marty...</i>
- [indistinct]
- Thank you.
<i>...and knew everything there is</i>
<i>to know about running a castle,</i>
<i>everyone just took him for granted.</i>
<i>His name was Mr. Underappreciated.</i>
What's ''underdemeciated''?
- Under de-what?
- Underdemeciated.
That's right,
I forgot you were six.
His name was Sir... Fix-A-Lot.
<i>But alas, the kingdom</i>
<i>where Sir Fix-A-Lot lived</i>
<i>did not place much value on dedication</i>
<i>or hard work, I guess.</i>
<i>Because the superstar in all</i>
<i>the land was Sir But-Kiss.</i>
<i>And he spent all his days</i>
<i>kissing everybody's but.</i>
[kissing sounds]
- Boo!
- [giggIes]
And my Iord, yes,
of course I can get you
front row house seats
to <i>The Lion King.</i> [Iaughs]
And Sir Fix-A-Lot had
a best friend, Friar Fred,
who was not right in the head.
She never! No! Not our queen,
I won't have that.
- Were there any kids in the kingdom?
- [Skeeter] Yes, yes. Of course.
<i>There were two young pages.</i>
Mistress Stinky
and Master SmeIIy.
Hey-oh! And don't forget...
JiIIian! The queen of the fairies!
<i>[Skeeter] Queen of the fairies?</i>
<i>I mean, if she has to be there,</i>
<i>let's just make her an angry raven.</i>
[caws]
Parking spot!
<i>[Patrick] She should be</i>
<i>a mermaid teacher.</i>
<i>[Bobbi] Yeah. The best</i>
<i>mermaid teacher in the world.</i>
ChiIdren, open your books to page 1 6.
Yes, Miss Mermaid.
Let's begin.
AII right, she's a mermaid.
Whatever you want.
Anyways, back to the story.
One day the king invited
aII his subjects to the castIe.
I bring gIad tidings.
For on this day
I have chosen a champion
who wiII run this castIe
and be my cIosest advisor
and bestest buddy.
My new champion is...
...Sir Butt-Kiss!
[cheers, appIause]
Thank you.
Poor Sir Fix-A-Lot had been passed over.
<i>So, Sir Fix-A-Lot</i>
<i>moved into a giant shoe,</i>
<i>got a bad case of athlete's face,</i>
<i>dove into a moat...</i>
Ah, what the heck.
[shouts]
<i>...and got eaten by crocodiles.</i>
[shouting]
The end.
The end? That can't be the end.
- Why? Why not?
- It's not happy.
There aren't happy endings in reaI Iife.
Sooner you know that, the better.
- It's not fair!
- What? What's not fair?
I mean, shouIdn't Sir Fix-A-Lot
at Ieast get a shot to be champion?
- A shot? Hmm...
- If Sir Fix-A-Lot is better
than Sir Butt-Kiss, he shouId
get a chance to prove it.
OK. Yeah, yeah,
Bobbi, good.
[Bobbi] What the king
reaIIy said was...
On second thought,
there is another worthy man
in my kingdom,
and it wouIdn't be fair
unIess he got a shot, too.
Sir Fix-A-Lot!
<i>[Skeeter] And then the crowd went nuts.</i>
[<i>#</i> Journey: <i>Don't Stop Believin</i>]
But, Sire, Fix-A-Lot
is as common as muck.
Boo!
<i>[Skeeter] And Friar Fred</i>
<i>drop-kicked a booing goblin.</i>
- Boo!
- [man shouts]
And the mermaid teacher did one of those
weird taiI doIphin moves.
And Stinky and SmeIIy
did the fastest Irish jig ever.
<i>Whoo-hoo-hoo!</i>
[Iaughs] Yeah. Right on.
<i>Prince Bugsy busted out</i>
<i>some fancy moves.</i>
[squeaking]
And then... and then...
It started raining gumbaIIs.
Raining gumbaIIs?
Why not? It's a bedtime story.
Anything can happen.
Yeah, yeah.
I guess in a story.
I just wish it was Iike that
in reaI Iife. I reaIIy do.
[beII chimes]
- What was that?
- Bugsy.
- [chitters]
- [Skeeter] Oh.
He rings that beII when he's hungry?
No, when he needs to go to sIeep.
[gurgIing sounds]
[yawning]
OK. As you wish,
Your Highness.
AII right, you guys, have a good sIeep.
You, too, uh, weird eyes.
- [Bugsy chitters]
- [Skeeter makes chirping noise]
[Skeeter] WeII, I don't
have much to work with,
but I wiII make us
a deIicious breakfast
that I know you wiII enjoy.
Yes, some banana
on the rice cake,
and then what do we caII this?
Wheat germ.
I was toId germs are bad for you,
but here goes.
I Iike it.
A rice cake-banana-wheat germ sandwich.
And what do we got?
This is terribIe.
Doesn't your, your mother
have taste buds?
What are we doing here?
We got nothing to use in this house.
Hang on.
A IittIe fIavor.
It's good because, now we don't
have to brush our teeth.
There you go. At Ieast we got
a IittIe mint going on. Guys want one?
- <i>[cell phone rings]</i>
- Hang on.
- <i>[ringtone screeches]</i>
- HeIIo!
Bronson? The teIevision set
in Mr. Nottingham's room
is broken and it needs
to be fixed right away.
I have a situation here.
I'm watching my nephew and my niece.
I'm sorry. Are you having
difficuIty hearing me?
Mr. Nottingham wants
to watch teIevision now!
I hear you.
I speak troIIinese, don't worry.
- <i>There's a leprechaun behind you.</i>

- Wow.
- It's pretty, huh?
Whoa!

Oh, right. Yes.

CouId you watch them a few minutes?
Huh?

- [Skeeter] Mr. Nottingham, sir?
- [Barry] Uh, the teIIy won't turn on.
[Skeeter] It won't? WeII, Iet me just

I'II just fIip this Iight on.
No, no, no, no!
AbsoIuteIy not!
I'm fighting a coId here.
I must stay in the dark
whenever possibIe.
Do you reaIize
germs can reproduce
80 percent faster in bright Iight?
Oh, OK. Here we go,
nice and dark again.
- The germs are confused.
- Come towards me.
OK. It's got to be
around here somewhere.
- [Skeeter shouts]
- [crashing]
[Barry] For heaven's sake.
I'm so sorry, sir.
I just can't see a thing.
- To your Ieft, there.
- Oh!
[Skeeter] There's the TV. So how's the,
uh, new hoteI coming, sir?
Oh, very weII. StiII deaIing with the
city on buiIding permits and whatnot.
Uh-huh.
I can't teII you the secret theme.
It's so good, we don't want
anyone to steaI it.
- I hear you, sir.
- OK, I'II teII you.
Come aIong, sit down. PIease.
Great.
[Barry] Ready?
Rock and roII.
Vintage vinyI.
Music memorabiIia in the Iobby.
Oh, OK. Like, uh, Iike the Hard Rock?
- The What What?
- The Hard Rock HoteI.
They've been using
that theme for, Iike, years.
Get KendaII Duncan
up here straightaway, pIease.
[VioIet] What a perfect
IittIe powder puff.
[squeaks, purrs]
Thank you.
So, Patrick, truth or dare?
Truth?
How oId were you the first time
you kissed a girI?
Patrick never kissed a girI.
GirIs are bis-crusting.
Except for Trisha Sparks.
Ooh, is that a girI in your cIass,
you IittIe Romeo?
[JiII] Hey, guys.
Hi, Aunt JiII, did you
get the note we Ieft you?
Yes, I did.
And, uh, now we have to get you guys
ready for schooI. So, come on.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Oh, hey. You're, uh...
- Uh-huh. Here's your fat mouse.
- It's a guinea pig, but...
And you, young man...
I want to hear aII about this IittIe
Trisha Sparks next time I see you.
Trisha Sparks is
two years oIder than you.
She's hot.
I'm very disappointed in you, KendaII.
We aImost made an apocaIyptic mistake.
This rock and roII idea
of yours is oId hat.
WeII, sir, I had every intention
of putting our own spin on it.
Do you know what, Skeeter?
I'm starting to get a fuzzy recoIIection
of something I said to your father.
In fact, I am going to give you a shot.
If you can come up with a better theme
than KendaII does,
I'II Iet you run the new pIace instead.
[KendaII Iaughs] Oh, sir.
Don't you think this is perhaps
a IittIe too much of a crueI joke
to be pIaying on somebody as...
weII, the, the maintenance guy?
- No, I don't.
- [KendaII] No.
Mr. Bronson has been working
for this company for 25 years.
I'm beginning to think I may have
seriousIy underdemeciated him.
[KendaII] I'm sorry.
''Underdemeciated''?
PreciseIy. You can both present your
ideas at my birthday party this weekend.
Thank you, KendaII.
That is aII.
Mr. Bronson, the teIevision,
if you wouId.
Oh, and do watch out
for the germ vaporizer.
- [crash]

You want to be the best,

Hey, uh, not to get personaI,

You know what? ActuaIIy it's

Yeah?
If you saved every paycheck you

Ah-ooga!
Oh, you wanna drag race, do you?
[spIutters, backfires]
You win! Good job.
What?
This is spooky.
You've got to be kidding me!
Look at this. I'm Iosing aII my candy.
How can you not see
a 50-foot traiIer? Come on.
So you have to compete for your job with
Skeeter Bronson. You'II annihiIate him.
Oh, I know. It's just

[phones ringing]
Thanks for being there.
I'II be there as Iong as
there's a there to be at.
[growIs]
[barks]
[cIears throat]
Oh, heIIo, chiIdren.
We're Iooking for Skeeter Bronson.
- [KendaII groans]
- Oh, Mr. Bronson.
Yes, you'II find him in room 1 09.
- OK.
- PIease, this way.
[Bugsy twitters]
- Oh, my God! Did you see that thing?
- Those eyes.
They were, they were staring
into my, my very souI.
- Hey, UncIe Skeeter!
- Hey!
- Just who I wanted to see.
- Hey, chief, here's Bugsy.
- Got him.
- Why do they have to stay here?
Because I'm on caII tonight,
Jennifer.
It's JiII, actuaIIy, Scooter.
It is? OK, yeah...
You did not just do that.
I did. Watch.
I'm gonna do it again.
So, guys, anything weird
happen to you today?
I had a substitute teacher
with an eye patch.
Uh... that's a IittIe weird.
I'm taIking Iike big-time weird.
Maybe coincidence weird, uh...
...as in gumbaII weird?
We're not aIIowed to chew gum.
Of course you're not.
You guys want to go to sIeep?
It's onIy 5:30.
And we haven't had dinner.
Hmm. OK.
Room service!
[man] So you've never
been skateboarding?
You've never pIayed video games?
Mom says they rot your brain.
That's not true. I've been pIaying video
games my whoIe Iife, and Iook at me.
Yeah, maybe she's got a point.
You. You've never eaten bacon?
What's bacon?
Bacon is the juicy,
fatty part of the pig
right adjacent to the rear.
But deIicious and tasty,
not how I just made it sound.
And this is the first hamburger
you've ever eaten?
- What's the verdict? What do you think?
- Life-changing.
- Mom's gonna kiII us.
- No, she isn't.
First of aII, she's never
gonna find out about this.
And second of aII, she used to eat
pIenty of hamburgers
when we were growing up
in this very room.
[both] She did?
Looks Iike Bugsy's eaten a Iot
of burgers in the Iast ten minutes.
Wow!
He keeps going Iike that,
we couId make bacon out of Bugsy.
[chirps]
He's kidding, Bugsy.
Take it easy.
- [both Iaugh]
- OK. Let's get you carnivores to bed.
I got a, a new story
I want to Iay on you.
What do you think
of cowboys and Indians?
Oh, yes, tonight's the night!
I just Iike cowboys and Indians
'cause of the confIict.
OK, once upon a time in the OId West,
OK, once upon a time in the OId West,
before room service was
even invented...
<i>...there was a farm hand</i>
<i>named Jeremiah Skeets.</i>
<i>He was looking to get</i>
<i>ahead in the world,</i>
<i>but was having a problem</i>
<i>with his current mode</i>
<i>of transportation.</i>
<i>[whinnies like a splutering</i>
<i>engine, backfires]</i>
[Jeremiah] Uh, that was my horse.
That wasn't me, everybody.
<i>Someone once told Jeremiah</i>
<i>that if he wanted to be the best,</i>
<i>he'd have to ride the best.</i>
You mind showing me your finest horse?
My ancestors beIieve horse spirit
come down from mountain
during time of fire, wind.
Many brave warrior
waIk traiI of moon bear...
OK. Look, I just want to see your finest
horse, not a whoIe thing there.
- Sorry. I can do it.
- AII right.
Screaming Rooster, bring out Ferrari.
Ferrari.
Oh, my.
Oh, my, oh, my!
Look at that.
- [whinnies Iike a racing engine]
- Whoa!
I wouId get automatic respect
riding such a beautifuI animaI,
but I'm afraid that's just
a bit out of my price range.
- TeII you what, white bread.
- [teeth cIick]
I'II give you Ferrari...
...for free!
Boo-yah!
The end. I Iove it.
BriIIiant story.
So he got the Ferrari for free.
I Iove that. I Iove that.
A guy getting a free horse?
That's not a good story.
Where's the arc? There's no arc.
I've not Iearned anything.
AIso, you've got
a moraI obIigation to them.
What are they gonna
waIk away from that with?
I didn't know we were doing
an After SchooI SpeciaI.
Why can't he do something
a reaI gentIeman wouId do,
Iike save a damseI in distress?
Not a bad idea, munchkin.
OK. So, uh...
Iet's continue.
<i>[Bobbi] Jeremiah was</i>

Now, any of you gentIemen want to give

Uh, yeah. No.
I was saying that because I wanted to
see if you two were paying attention.
<i>What happened was Jeremiah</i>
<i>dropped Miss Davenport off</i>
<i>in the nearest town, safe and sound.</i>
How ever can I thank you, sir?
Ah, no thanks necessary, ma'am.
But I do insist on expressing
my gratitude in some manner.
Fair enough. I'II take...
- ...$1 00 miIIion.
- [cash register dings]
The end. Let's hope it works.
Very weII written,
briIIiantIy constructed.
Jeremiah wouIdn't take money
for doing a good deed.
Uh... I know Jeremiah
a Iot better than you guys.
And beIieve me, he'd be aII over that.
He Ioves money.
Mmm!
I don't want that.
Go back, rewrite. Rewrite.
GentIemen don't get paid.
WiII you just...
Who's teIIing the story here?
It shouId reaIIy end more Iike this.
WeII, I must give you
some token of my appreciation.
Oh, no.
Perhaps... a kiss?
Touchdown.
<i>[Patrick] Then an angry dwarf kicks him.</i>
Ow!
What the heck did you do that for?
Because I'm angry.

- Go! Let's go!
[woman] AII right! Yeah!
I didn't do nothing to you!
- The end.
- [Skeeter] You know what?
Laugh as much as you want.
I'II take a Ferrari
and a kiss any day of the week.
I'd just Iike to kiss a Ferrari.
- AII right. Good night.
- Good night, UncIe Skeeter.
Good night, home sIice.
Thanks for the stories.
You came up with
aII the good parts, Bobbi.
Good night, y'aII.
You too there, Bugsy.
[twittering]
And them braids Iook fantastic.
They've taken years off you.
You mind sIeeping over?
I'm gonna duck out a few hours.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Mmm. By the way, um,
I am, uh, IegaIIy obIiged to teII you
that I suffer from...
sIeep panic disorder.
OK, what's, uh, sIeep panic disorder?
BeIieve me, you don't want to know.
What am I thinking? Why wouId
anyone give me a free Ferrari?
I must be Iosing my mind.
Much power of the horse
underneath that hood.
HeIIo.
Are you the guy I'm supposed to see?
I'm here, aren't I?
So... am I about to get
a cherry red Ferrari?
I don't see why not.
For... free?
Sounds good to... me!
What do I do now?
Eat a gumbaII or something?
Yes.
- FeII out of the sky, right?
- Yeah.
Shh!
Oh! Shh.
I won't teII nobody.
Now, cIose your eyes

How am I ever going to thank you?
Hmm.
No thanks is necessary, ma'am?
Oh, am I in the presence

At your service, ma'am.
WeII, I must show

This is sick!
WeII, uh, good Iuck with that.
I'm just going to go.
What do you mean?
Do you have another one at your house?

Hey, guys.
How did Iast night go?
An angry dwarf kicked me in the Ieg,
and I didn't get a free Ferrari.
So there you go.
Oh. How sad.
- He's taIking about our bedtime story.
- Oh.
UncIe Skeeter said Jeremiah wouId get
a new horse and a kiss,
but I said the dwarf wouId kick him.
You said it.
Maybe that's how it works.
The kids controI the stories.
[chimes ring]
And there are the wind chimes.
You know what that means.
What what means?
Huh?
Nothing.
Don't worry about it.
I won't.
OK, guys. Um, what is Bugsy doing?
[panting]
Working off the hamburgers
he ate Iast night.
Yes, I gave Bugsy some hamburgers,
but I gave the chiIdren
that wheat germ stuff
because that's what they Iove.
I guess it's, uh, Bugsy
watching the TV then too?
Yeah, I fIipped that on
and, Iook, he's gIued to it.
[makes giggIing sounds]
[screaming]
I'm innocent!
What was that?
Uh... that was the sIeep
panic disorder, I beIieve.
Why don't we, uh, get out of
here before the next attack.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Give your uncIe a kiss.
I'm a reIative, I deserve it.
Right there.
Oh, that feIt nice.
How about one more for the road?
- No.
- Come on, baby!
Don't worry, we'II be back tonight.
Yeah, no, I'm not worried.
You're coming back,

- Lights are out in the spa.
- The south service eIevator is sIow.
- Check.
Let me try that cheesecake.
Oh, another thing.
I heard about your big hero act
with my girIfriend Iast night.
- This paparazzi was...
- I know what it is you're trying to do,

You have to find another way
to cozy up to the oId man
because I'm here to teII you
VioIet Nottingham is not gonna
date a gum-scraping handyman.
Hey, KendaII.
Two things. First off,
you got something right there.
Yeah, now, use your hands.
That's disturbing to see.
Good. SecondIy, when I get
the job at the new hoteI,
I was actuaIIy considering keeping
you on, so watch your tone with me.
Your brief IittIe trip
to the Iand of make-beIieve
is just about over, my friend. OK?
We aII know your faiIed father
ran this hoteI into the ground,

- <i>This school is being shut down.</i>

<i>The old man pulled a few strings</i>

It's caIIed...
<i>... The Great Hotel Idea Story.</i>
Yeah!

Come on, guys,
I reaIIy need you to do this.
It's gonna heIp

AII right, you know what?
We stiII got one more night.
Let's have a fun story.
How about some EveI KnieveI stuff?
Racing, jumping, fIying...
Or maybe something Iike romantic?
[kissing sounds, chitters]
I have a good idea.
Let's combine the action
and the romance
and make a romaction story.
- [both] Yeah.
- [Skeeter] Let us begin.
The greatest of aII the heroes
in ancient Greece
was, of course, Skeetacus.
<i>He was truly amazing</i>
<i>yet totally underrated</i>
<i>and had been ignored for years.</i>
<i>Finally Skeetacus had his chance</i>
<i>to show his skills in the grand arena.</i>
<i>If he could impress the</i>
<i>daughter of the emperor,</i>
<i>he knew he would one day rule the land.</i>
- [horse whinnies]
- [crowd cheering]
- <i>Skeetacus, Skeetacus!</i>
- Go on, Skeetacus!
That's pretty fancy chariot work.
For a peasant.
<i># I see London, I see France</i>
<i># I see my golden underpants</i>
Whoo!
Oh, wh... what is he doing?
Whoa!
[whinnying]
[Skeeter] Bring on the eIephants!
- Whoa.
- Ooh.
AII right.
<i>[Skeeter] You know how Hercules</i>
<i>supposedly founded the Olympics?</i>
[trumpeting]
[twitters]
<i>Well, Skeetacus invented the X Games.</i>
He's never gonna make it!
- [shouting]
- [crowd gasping]
Now that's first cIass.
Hey!
- Bravo!
- Wow.
Can you dig it?
[crowd chants] Skeetacus!
How we doing so far, huh?
- This is the best story yet.
- Can we get to the romance now?
<i>[Skeeter] Well, shorty, you tell me?</i>
<i>Does Skeetacus get</i>
<i>the girl he was after?</i>
<i>[Bobbi] In these stories,</i>
<i>the hero always gets the fairest</i>
<i>maiden in the land.</i>
Yes! You said it!
OK, so it's gonna happen!
Uh, right. So, what? They're thirsty?
They go off for drinks?
A IittIe wine and cheese action? Yes?
<i>[Bobbi] Yeah, they can go to an old</i>
<i>tavern. And guess who's there?</i>
Led ZeppeIin.
Say Led ZeppeIin, pIease.
No. AII the girIs that were mean
to Skeetacus growing up.
What? Nobody was mean
to Skeetacus growing up.
He was Iike
the cooIest guy in schooI.
That's not what Mom said.
AII right, everybody was
mean to Skeetacus.
He had probIems.
AII right, teII your story.
Oh, my God...
<i>[Bobbi] They see he's now with</i>
<i>the fairest maiden in all the land,</i>
<i>and they are really jealous.</i>
<i>[Patrick] So jealous they</i>
<i>don't know what to do.</i>
They just start nervousIy
doing the hokey-pokey.
<i>[all] # Put your right hand in</i>
<i># You put your right hand out</i>
<i># You put your right hand in</i>
<i># And you shake it all about</i>
OK.
<i>[Bobbi] So then,</i>
<i>Skeetacus takes his date</i>
<i>out to the beach.</i>
<i>[Patrick] All of a sudden,</i>
<i>a big hairy guy</i>
<i>washes up onshore, passed out.</i>
<i>[Skeeter] Why a hairy guy?</i>
<i>I don't get it.</i>
<i>[Patrick] Just 'cause.</i>
<i>He had something stuck in his throat,</i>
<i>and he wasn't breathing.</i>
- Thanks.
- He's OK.
And then it starts pouring,
so they run into a magicaI cave.
- Caves are nice.
- And Abe LincoIn's there.
Abe LincoIn?
What, is this a joke to you?
What the heck's the matter with you?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I, I didn't mean to yeII.
The Abe LincoIn thing, that's,
that's a good idea.
It's just that, uh...
Does Skeetacus get a kiss?
Don't you think he shouId?
It's... been a Iong time for him.
His Iips are very dry
from not using them.
- Bugsy, you with me?
- [groans]
We'II see.
- <i>[Violet] Hello?</i>
- Mmm.
Hey, is this the fairest maiden
in the Iand?
Mr. Skeeter Bronson, is that you?
<i>Yes, it is. Sorry about that Ferrari</i>
<i>confusion the other night.</i>
I'm here at the beach right now
and I had a hunch you might be here too.
What do you say
we get a IittIe Iunchsky?
<i>That sounds so delightful.</i>
But I can't. I'm afraid I'm
on my way to Vegas for the day.
Vegas?
Uh, no one taIked about Vegas.
Don't teII KendaII.
He thinks I'm in the Iibrary.
Yeah, no. But, but, uh, princess,
I, I reaIIy thought we
were gonna hang out today.
Oh, weII. I wiII see you
at Daddy's birthday party.
<i>Bye, Skeeter.</i>
Hmm.
So our date's gonna be tomorrow?
I can Iive with that.
- Hey! Look out! Look out!
- [both shouting]
- [Skeeter groans]
- Sorry. Are you OK? Hey! I'm so sorry!
What is it about the cushion
of protection you don't Iike?
Aren't you supposed to be in schooI?
I'm supposed to be
Iooking for a job now,
but for some reason I feIt Iike
coming to the beach today.
Huh.
Um, are you hungry?
Yes, I'm aIways hungry
when I'm in pain.
Good. Because I'm buying.
I'II Iet you buy me Iunch.
Somebody stoIe my waIIet,
- so how was I gonna pay?
- Of course you got your waIIet stoIen.
- I don't know what that means.
- You. It's aIways something with you.
- Huh?
- You're wearing my hat.
- Gonna wear that aII day?
- I'm not wearing nobody's hat.
- I'm wearing your hat! Oh!
- I'II take it back. Thanks.
[chattering]
This is perfect for your free Iunch.
Oh, my gosh. You guys,
you guys, you guys. Over there.
Is that...
is that Skeeter Bronson?
- Stop it.
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.
- Skeeter.
Hey! Do you remember me?
It's Donna Hynde from high schooI.
Yeah, I do.
Thought I was going to run into you
shortIy. And here you are.
Yeah. Wow, this is so...
weird. Uh...
We were just pIanning
our high schooI reunion.
We were totaIIy just taIking about you.
It's so weird.
I was just taIking about you guys too.
Sure, he was.
Mind pretending to be
my girIfriend for a second?
Yeah, I don't feeI
comfortabIe doing that.
I'II, uh, convert my truck to biodieseI.
- OK, I'II do it.
- Ding-dong.
Uh, this is my girIfriend,
guys. This is JiII.
HeIIo.
She's your girIfriend?
Yeah. Yeah.
Yes, I am.
- Right?
- Yup.
She thinks I'm...
You want me to...
Oh. Uh... romantic.
She Iikes how romantic I can be.
And, uh, ''great kisser,''
she Iikes to say.
Oh, yeah. That's...
a IittIe too much.
- Oh. Sorry.
- Wow, you are reaIIy pretty.
- I mean, she's aII right.
- Thanks.
I've seen hotter,
but she's pretty cooI.
So super skinny.
Skinnier than you.
But... Yeah.
Whatever.
I feeI reaIIy awfuI
saying this out Ioud.
We were reaIIy terribIe to Skeeter
in high schooI. AwfuI. So mean.
My Skeeter?
- They were.
- You had a hard time in high schooI?
Look at you now.
You turned out pretty... cute.
- [girIs] Yeah!
- You know...
the pimpIes went away,
and, uh, these came to pIay.
- You want to touch them?
- Oh, that's OK.
- Later, Iater.
- They're here for you. Ding-dong.
<i># You put your right hand in</i>
<i>[all] # You put your right hand out</i>
<i># You put your right hand in</i>
- <i># And you shake it all about</i>
- OK.
- I think we shouId Ieave.
- Yes.
<i># And you turn yourself around</i>
- AII right. Bye-bye.
- <i># That's what it's all about #</i>
What's happening?
Hey, so I spoke to Wendy.
She's excited to see the kids tomorrow.
This is the Iongest
she's been away from them.
That's right.
This is my Iast night with the kids.
You know,
they're gonna be devastated.
They worship you
and those amazing bedtime stories
you've been teIIing them.
Oh, weII, they say aII the good parts.
I promise.
Oh, my gosh.
Is he unconscious?
Yeah, yeah.
[yeIIing]
Boom! Oh.
Thanks!
Whoa!
- Yeah?
- Check out Mr. Smooth.
- WeII, you know, I do what I do.
- [both Iaughing]
- Think we shouId get out of this rain?
- What rain?
[thunder rumbIing]
Oh, shoot!
Where did that come from?
I don't know!
Isn't it amazing?
- Let's get out of this!
- Let's go! Let's get out! Move it!
[JiII screaming, Iaughing]
I can read the future.
Good God. So...
So... The big presentation's
tomorrow, right?
I know you're not nervous
or anything, but, um...
good Iuck on it anyway.
- Thank you.
- Yep.
ActuaIIy, you can come
if you want. It's Iike a party.
You know, Wendy's gonna be
watching the kids,
and we couId have fun.
You can meet me there.
Yeah. That wouId, uh...
I couId do that.
I couId meet you, um...
...after night schooI or something.
It's you?
It's me what?
You're the fairest maiden in the Iand?
''Fair'' as in
''doesn't cheat at checkers''?
No, fairest as in...
...''beautifuIest.''
Wait, wait.
Something weird's gonna happen.
Oh.
No, yeah, we don't...
This is a mistake.
No, no, no, not between us.
I mean Iike, some...
No! No, no!
Oh, here comes Abe!
No!
Ah! Look.
- Wow, a penny.
- No, no, no.
This is the weird thing
I was taIking about. Abe LincoIn.
- Yeah. Yeah.
- No, no, no, no.
Abe's not gonna interrupt
this time. That was it.
It's supposed to end better than this.
Stick around. I'm teIIin' ya,
you're gonna be missing out.
Nice imagination, Patrick.
- Skeeter?
- Yo.
We've got a IittIe bit
of a shaving situation in there.
Oh, no, no, no.
I took the razor bIades out.
Don't worry. Their father ain't around,
I figured someone has to
teach them how to shave.
[kids giggIing]
I'm Princess Leia.
Uh-huh.
So, are you ready
for the big showdown tomorrow night?
Oh, yeah.
What I'm going to do is
teII them a bedtime story tonight.
I'II have me win in the story.
Then I'II win for reaIs.
Do you dig?
Oh, right. Yeah, yeah, I understand.
So it's Iike, um,
positive visuaIization.
I read a book on that once.
Read the back cover, at Ieast.
I can't read.
[Iaughing]
Shut up, Bugsy!
I've got opposabIe thumbs.
How do you feeI about that?
[stops Iaughing]
[Skeeter] You chiIdren ready?
Because here comes our Iast story.
The fate of the entire universe
hung in the baIance,
as the Supreme GaIactic CounciI
<i>met to determine who would control</i>
<i>the new planet in the vast</i>
<i>Notinghamian star system.</i>
[aII cheering]
<i>Most in atendance expected</i>
<i>Supreme Leader Barracto</i>
<i>to rule in favor of General Kendallo,</i>
<i>the evil governor of Hotelium.</i>
<i>But there was a wild card in the mix...</i>
<i>...Skeeto Bronsonnian</i>
<i>and his sidekick,</i>
<i>Mickey Doo Quicky Doo.</i>
<i>They all watched with excitement.</i>
<i>Lieutenant Jilli</i>
<i>and her two young cadets,</i>
<i>Aspenoff, and even</i>
<i>the great Captain Bugzoid.</i>
<i>[Patrick] Hey, since it's outer space,</i>
<i>Skeeto should talk like a goofy alien.</i>
- <i>[Skeeter] What?</i>
- [gibberish]
That's disgusting.
I'm not going to transIate that.
SiIence!
The Ieader of the new pIanet
shaII be determined
the oId-fashioned way:
A zero-gravity fight.
- [aII gasp]
- [continues gibberish]
<i>[Skeeter] OK, now we get to the part</i>
<i>the crowd came to see.</i>
<i>Skeeto defeating Kendallo, right?</i>
<i>[Patrick] I think we need</i>
<i>to see them batle first.</i>
[Iaughs eviIIy]
[gibberish]
[yeIIing]
[shouting]
[grunts]
<i>[Patrick] Kendallo makes the first move.</i>
[Iaughing]
- [both] Skeeto!
- <i>[Skeeter] But the kids</i>
<i>really want to see Skeeto</i>
<i>kick his but, right?</i>
- [shouts]
- [groans]
Wet wiIIy.
[Iaughs]
Boring!
Uh, bring out the booger monster!
<i>[Skeeter] Oh, I think I'm gonna be sick.</i>
[crowd groaning]
[shouting]
[yeIIing]
<i>[Skeeter] All right, have the booger</i>
<i>monster smack Kendallo around.</i>
<i>[Bobbi] No, I think he should kiss him.</i>
- [monster grunting]
- [groaning]
<i>[Skeeter] Would you get</i>
<i>to Skeeto winning already?</i>
<i>[Patrick] OK.</i>
[screams]
Whoa!
- [monster cries]
- [groaning]
Arise, Skeeto,
sharif of Nottinghamia.
[screeching]
[gibberish]
- Whoopee!
- Whoo!
[whistIing]
And that is the perfect ending
to our Iast story.
Thank you, chiIdren.
Oh, that's not the ending.
Yeah. That wouId be too obvious.
What do you mean?
Somebody threw a firebaII at Skeeto
and Skeeto got incineratated.
- The end.
- ''Incineratated''?
- [crowd groans]
- <i>[Skeeter] You mean ''incinerated''?</i>
No! No, no!
He can't catch on fire.
Yeah. I'm Captain Skeeto.
I'm on fire!
[Skeeter] No, no, no.
The story can't end Iike that.
What happened to a nice, happy ending?
You said happy endings
don't reaIIy happen.
We want our story to be reaI.
Oh, I was just saying that.
I was stupid.
- [yawns]
- No, no, no, no, no.
So, what? We're reaIIy going
to have me on fire? Hey!
Don't faII asIeep, or the story
wiII Iock. Stop it! Wake up!
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.
I can't beIieve
Skeeter didn't teII you.
And I'm sure it's just a
coincidence that the new hoteI
is going up right here
where the, where the schooI is.
- WeII, I'm pretty sure...
- [phone rings]
Excuse me. Yeah.
<i>[Aspen] Everything's ready</i>
<i>for the presentation.</i>
- Good.
- <i>Ten-four, rubber duck.</i>
Got it. Great.

The bad news is,
you're probabIy gonna catch on fire,
but not if you take a few precautions.
Oven mitts, smoke aIarm.
Yeah.
''FIame-resistant
Christmas tree spray.'' Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
this wiII work.
Excuse me. Sir?
Those are actuaIIy for Christmas trees.
I know. 'Tis the season.
- Ow! God!
- I'm so sorry.
[sobbing] It burns!
Here, Iet me make it up to you.
- [screams] Ow!
- It's for trees!
It's for trees!
You're right! That hurts!
I'm sorry about that!
[Aspen] AntibacteriaI wipes, anybody?
AIoha. AIoha.
Thank you so much.
Whoa!
Steady. Steady.
[shouts]
- Kona coffee ice cream.
- Yeah? What's the catch?
You're gonna Iight it on fire?
'Cause I'm on to you, honey.
No fire. It wouId meIt.
Just take the ice cream
and a chiII piII.
- Ah!
- [crowd] Boo!
- [Mickey] Skeeter.
- Yes.
- That wasn't very nice.
- What wasn't?
- You pushed that man in the pooI.
- No, he jumped in.
Hey, you see JiII around?
No, I ain't, I ain't
seen JiII tonight, mate.
Ooh! I am coId.
- I'II get you a toweI.
- [cups faIIing]
- I've got your toweI.
- Oh, bIimey.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I Iove you.
[bee buzzing]
You brought me a griIIed cheese
sandwich once.
Yeah. I did, yes.
It was Monterey Jack.
It's a good cheese.
[buzzing]
Ow!
Skeeter, are you aII right?
A bee stung my tongue!
[gongs]
The meeting for the exciting new hoteI
wiII take pIace in the Iiving room.
So I don't think you're going
to want to miss this.
No, it's sweIIing up!
- Can I sit there, pIease, mate?
- Yes, of course.
- Don't touch me.
- Sorry.
Before we begin,
I wouId just Iike to say,
personaIIy, happy birthday.
[aII] Happy birthday.
Happy birthday, Daddy.
Thank you, KendaII.
Yes, now, as you can see,
I've invited some of the staff to sit in
to see how your ideas wouId
pIay with the ''reguIar foIk.''
- No offense.
- None taken, Barry. None taken.
[Barry] So, gentIemen,
which of you wouId Iike to go first?
Fair enough.
Mr. Nottingham,
you were absoIuteIy right
when you said the rock and roII
theme was oId hat.
Gone. Your insight, sir,
has inspired me to,
to dig deeper,
to find the commonaIity
at the heart
of the American experience.
I speak, of course...
...of the musicaI theater.
And, more specificaIIy...
...Broadway!
Hit it.
<i># Oh, when you first pull up</i>
<i># To the grand front door</i>
<i># There isn't just a bellhop</i>
<i>There's an overture</i>
<i># At the Notingham</i>
<i>Broadway Mega Resort</i>
<i># Oh there's a pool</i>
<i>for the Sharks</i>
<i># A pool for the Jets</i>
<i># And you can bring Cats</i>
<i>'cause we take pets</i>

[whines]
OriginaI, impressive, weII done.
Thank you, KendaII.
- Thank you, sir.
- [appIause]
[screams]
Uh, sorry about that.
I was, uh,
just resting my eyes.
Skeeter. You're up.
[cIearing throat]
[gibberish]
Are you aII right, Skeeter?
A bee bit my tongue.
I'm sorry?
A bee... stung my tongue.
''A bee stung my tongue.''
Oh, you understand him? Oh.
How did a bee sting your tongue?
Uh...
I was eating ice cream,
and suddenIy a bee...
Uh, it was on an ice cream,
and he Iicked it.
Hmm. Can you transIate
Skeeter's presentation for us?
- Mmm!
- Uh... Yes!
Yes, I can do that.
[cIapping]
Thank you. Ready?
- [Mickey] I'm ready. OK.
- [Skeeter] Ready?
[gibberish]
''I spent the Iast week in the hoteI,
the hoteI where I Iive...''
With my niece and nephew.
''With my niece and my nephew.''
''To a kid, everything about a
hoteI is strange and wonderfuI.''
''SIeeping in a different bed.''
''Hanging out in the Iobby.''
''Jumping up and down on the aIIigator.''
[grunts]
''Riding up and down in the eIevator.''
[aII] Ah!
Sorry. Yeah, I see now
that an aIIigator
wouIdn't be in that context.
''Some hoteIs try to make it seem
as much Iike home as possibIe.''
''But they're missing
the point.''
''If you wanted to stay in a pIace
Iike home, then why not stay at home?''
''Our guests shouId experience
an escape from the everyday.''
''And that's what I'd Iike to capture
in our new hoteI.''
''What every kid knows
and what every aduIt has forgotten.''
''Like my father said to me,
your fun is onIy Iimited
by your imagination.''
- That was beautifuI.
- Yeah? AII right. SettIe down.
Just the way it buiIt.
And that's it? I'm sorry.
I don't understand it.
That... was... briIIiant!
CongratuIations, my boy.
You've just won the keys to the kingdom.
[grunts]
[whimpers]
Boogie, don't do that. Germs.
CongratuIations. Great job.
Keep icing that tongue.
- AII right.
- CongratuIations, Skeeter.
- CongratuIations. That was great.
- Yeah?
[imitates gibberish]
That's just terrific.
CongratuIations, Skeeter.
AII right, KendaII.
Yeah. No hard feeIings, paI.
Of course not. You deserve it.
You're a better man than me.
- You have an iron wiII.
- Yeah. That's what they say.
I wouId not have the guts to tear down
the schooI my niece and nephew attend.
What?
You do know that's the site
for the new hoteI?
What are you taIking about?
- Good show, oId son.
- Oh, sir.
That bee sting Ianguage was reaIIy
working for you on a sympathetic IeveI.
Good, I'm gIad. I wanted to taIk to you
about the Iocation
that we're buiIding the hoteI.
<i>[all] # Happy birthday to you</i>
<i># Happy birthday to you</i>
<i># Happy birthday</i>
[drums beating]
[aII excIaiming]
Bronson, you're fired!
Fired?
Oh...
That's how it connects.
[beII rings]
Yes?
Do you know where
JiII Hastings' cIass is?
It's right over there.
Why won't you answer my caIIs?
Because I know it's you caIIing.
You got to beIieve me, JiII.
I had no idea...
Don't destroy the sIiver of respect
I have for you by making Iame excuses.
Just go away and stay away.
UncIe Skeeter? Do you want
to incinertate our schooI
'cause we incinertated you in the story?
No, I wouIdn't do that.
We thought you were
supposed to be the good guy.
So did I.
''Skeeto defeats KendaIIo.''
- Not reaIIy.
- [knocking]
- Yeah?
- Hey.
Oh, hey.
WeIcome back.
So, you mad at me, too?
Not as mad as JiII,
but, uh, mad, yes.
I didn't know the new hoteI
was going up there.
I figured that.
Then what are you mad at?
I gave the kids junk food?
No, I figured you'd do that too.
I'm mad because you toId my kids
that in reaI Iife
there are no happy endings.
WeII, Iook around you, Wendy.
Do you see any happy endings here?
I don't know. You and Dad aIways had
so much fun in this room.
For whatever reason, I didn't.
I was aIways the cynic,
the, the sourpuss.
[Skeeter] The bIack cIoud.
The energy drainer.
The... dead fish.
Yes, aII of those things.
But when I Ieft Bobbi
and Patrick with you,
I guess I just was hoping
you'd rub off on them.
Get them to be Iighter.
Have fun. Enjoy themseIves.
I thought Dad wouId Iike that.
Anyway, um, I got a job in Arizona.
Teaching, not principaIing.
That's cooI.
Yeah, weII, maybe you can come
visit when we get settIed.
I know by then the kids
wiII reaIIy want to see you.
AII right. Love you.
Love you.
<i>[Marty] And so Skeeter sat on his bed,</i>
<i>filled with regret,</i>
<i>wondering how to put the pieces</i>
<i>of his life together</i>
<i>after one magical week.</i>
- Great ending, huh?
- <i>[Marty] That was your ending, son?</i>
<i>I thought this was just a sad part,</i>
<i>and you were about to make it beter.</i>
What? How couId I make it any better?
<i>Well, In the stories I told you,</i>
<i>just when things looked bleakest,</i>
<i>the hero would do something</i>
<i>unexpected and courageous</i>
<i>to beat the bad guy,</i>
<i>save the day, and get the girl!</i>
Yeah. How can I do that?
<i>It's your story, not mine.</i>
<i>But you beter get moving.</i>
<i>Go get 'em, son.</i>
Mr. Nottingham! Mr. Nottingham?
I was wondering if I couId
taIk to you for a moment.
My name is JiII Hastings.
I'm a teacher at Webster EIementary.
[aII chanting] Save our schooI!
Save our schooI!
Save our schooI!
Save our schooI!
Save our schooI!
Save our schooI!
My men are in position.
We are ready for the demoIition.
ExceIIent.
Mr. Nottingham said he'd caII
if he had a probIem
getting the variance,
so if we don't hear from him
in the next 20 minutes,
I say we just... bIow it aII up.
[chanting continues]
Madam, the war is over.
You Iost. I'm sorry.
This isn't a war, Mr. Nottingham.
We're taIking about chiIdren.
There must be other possibIe
sites for your hoteI compIex
that wouId not resuIt
in the dispIacement...
Hey, hey! Barry, JiII.
How you doing?
We're just wrapping up here.
Donna, you remember JiII, right?
Of course! Oh, my God.
That jacket is so cute!
Uh, thank you.
Bronson, what are you doing here?
What am I doing here?
Yeah, what am I doing here?
Oh, uh, weII, Mr. Bronson,
as a concerned citizen,
wanted to bring points to my attention
before I made any hasty
decisions about the property.
And they are points that are going
to take me years to anaIyze.
- Years?
- Years.
Bronson, are you
pIaying hardbaII with me?
I am, sir.
Because your appIication
for variance has been...
Denied.
Denied?
Yes. But the good news is
Donna and I found you
another piece of property
right on the beach in Santa Monica
that is uptight and out of sight.
Beachfront was my first choice,
but it's not for saIe.
It is now.
It is! Isn't that fabuIous?
ReaIIy?
Friends?
Oh, oh. [stammers]
Yeah, weII, germs.
Let's get past that.
Come here. Come here.
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm touching you,
and it's OK. Look at that.
Aw...
Ooh. You're enjoying it.
Good. Bring me cIoser.
That is so sweet. And creepy.
[chanting]
Attention, pIease,
Iadies and gentIemen.
We are working with highIy-sensitive,
dangerous radio-controIIed expIosives.
[aII] Boo!
And so to avoid any tragic misfires,
I wouId ask that you aII
turn off your ceII phones.
AII of you, pIease.
Turn your ceII phones off.
Did you reaIIy just fix everything?
Not everything.
[cIears throat]
- Yes?
- We appear to have a situation.
I can't reach KendaII on his ceII phone
to haIt the demoIition
which wiII begin in... 1 3 minutes.
[Patrick] This sign we made
is awesome!
[Bobbi] We need a window where
those construction guys can see it.
Then they'II change their minds.
Bobbi, I found one.
[JiII] That's my Prius!
- OK. Where's your truck?
- My truck?
I had to give it back to the hoteI.
What do you mean
you gave it back to the hoteI?
Come here!
Come here!
- [motorcycIe revs]
- [Skeeter] Sorry!
It's for a good cause!
Have you ever driven a motorcycIe?
No!
[gasps]
- Oh, my God!
- [horn honks]
[JiII groaning]
No, no, no, no!
[screams]
Ooh! Yah! Booya!
[JiII screaming]
Have you seen Bobbi? Patrick?
Bobbi! Patrick!
What are you going to do?

OK, bye, guys.
<i>[Marty] I think Bugsy</i>
<i>is trying to tell us</i>
<i>that our tale has reached its end.</i>
<i>But before I go, let me tell you</i>
<i>what our heroes and villains</i>
<i>are doing now.</i>
<i>My old friend, Barry Notingham,</i>
<i>overcame his fear of germs</i>
<i>to such a degree</i>
<i>that he decided to leave</i>
<i>the hotel business</i>
<i>and enter the field of medicine.</i>
<i>He is currently the school nurse</i>
<i>at Webster Elementary.</i>
<i>Violet now runs the hotel empire,</i>
<i>along with her husband, Mickey,</i>
<i>the former room service waiter</i>
<i>who is now the ninth-richest</i>
<i>person in the world.</i>
<i>And Skeeter and Jill?</i>
<i>After the double wedding of the century,</i>
<i>they lived... well, happily ever after,</i>
<i>running Marty's Motel</i>
<i>and spending a lot of time</i>
<i>with my grandkids,</i>
<i>whose adventures have just begun.</i>
<i>Though, not everyone</i>
<i>is quite so excited.</i>
<i>But that is a whole other story.</i>
<i>The end.</i>
