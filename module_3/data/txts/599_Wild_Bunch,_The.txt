Get them over.
Oh, no.
<i>Do not drink wine nor strong drink,
thou, nor thy sons with thee...</i>
...least ye shall die. Look not, though,
upon the wine when it is red...
...and when it bringeth his color in the
cup, when it moveth itself aright...
...at the last, it biteth like a serpent
and stings like an adder.
Now, folks...
...that's from the Good Book,
but in this here town...
...it's 5 cents a glass.
Five cents a glass.
Does anyone really think that
that is the price of a drink?
The price of a drink.
Let him decide who has lost
his courage and his pride...
...who lies a groveling heap of clay
not far removed...
All's quiet, sir.
Let's fall in.
Follow me.
I beg your pardon, ma'am.
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- Allow me, ma'am.
- Thank you.
- May I?
Thank you.
Thornton, wake up. Soldiers.
Take a look.
I don't care what you meant to do,
it's what you did that I don't like.
You've inconvenienced this lady,
made a fool of yourself and this railroad.
Now, I want you to apologize to this...
Yes, sir, can I help you?
If they move, kill them.
Is he with them?
He's there.
Okay, hold your fire. Get down.
Come on, wait till they come out.
I can nail him.
He said, wait!
What if they slip out the back?
It's covered, you two-bit
redneck peckerwood.
Abe.
I solemnly promise...
...God helping me...
I solemnly promise, God helping me...
...to abstain from all distilled, fermented
malt liquors, including wine, beer and cider.
...to abstain from liquors,
including wine, cider and beer.
People marching and singing
on the street. They'll pass the horses.
We'll join them.
The Temperance Union?
- They should have been told.
- Told what?
How long could anybody in this manure pile
shut his mouth?
Rifles.
One... No, three.
Maybe more. There, on the roof.
Get down.
Son of a bitch.
- Lyle, Dutch.
- What are they, bounty hunters?
Hell, I wouldn't know.
Buck, with Abe.
- I kill them now?
- Hold them as long as you can...
...until the shooting starts.
I'll hold them till hell freezes
or you say different.
When I kick him out, blast them.
We'll make a run for it.
C.L., give me that shotgun.
Set?
Let's go!
Good luck, boys.
They're blowing this town all to hell.
You trash.
Now you just hush, now.
Hey, they was playing
"Gather at the River."
You know that one?
Sing it.
Sing it, come on.
Come on, you lazy bastard.
I'm coming, damn it.
Hey, they've cleared out, for chrissake.
Let's go, T.C.
Let's go!
Take him.
Oh, he's mine.
- He's mine.
- Mr. Harrington. Mr. Harrington.
- He's mine.
- You know damn well I shot this one.
- Look at the size of that hole.
- Dig out that bullet...
- ...and see if it ain't my ought-six.
- Goddamn it, you know I shot this one.
You'd claim the whole thing,
wouldn't you?
They have any money?
Oh, damn. Damn, I can't get his belt off.
You telling me you shot him
and I didn't hit him?
You stupid damn fools.
Why did you shoot this employee
and let the others get away?
I didn't shoot him.
My first shot killed this man.
Liar! He was shooting that employee full
of holes while I was dropping this bandit.
And them others too.
I must have killed all three of them.
You killed all three?
What was we doing up on that roof?
- Liar! Black liar!
- You shouldn't talk like that to me.
I'm sorry.
Come on, T.C., help me get his boots.
I think...
I think this will do pretty good.
Harrigan.
The next time, plan your massacre
more carefully, or I'll start with you.
Why didn't you kill Pike
when you had the chance?
Hey.
Hey, stop. Stop.
Feathers flew like a turkey.
Well, they shouldn't have run.
They shouldn't have run.
Sing!
Well, how would you like to kiss
my sister's black cat's ass?
This is better than a hog killing.
Get them out of here.
Go on, get out.
Get them out of here.
We're holding you and your damned
railroad responsible for this carnage.
- Mr. Benson...
- Innocent people are dead.
Women dying and mangled because
you used our town as a battlefield.
You'll pay! The railroad is gonna pay
for our loss!
We were trying to catch
a band of outlaws.
You lured that gang in here.
The railroad has been blabbing
about a big silver payload for weeks.
We represent the law.
My back.
Pike, that you? I can ride, Pike.
I can ride.
I can't see, but I can ride.
I can't ride. Finish it, Mr. Bish...
You boys want to move on,
or stay here and give him a decent burial?
He was a good man,
and I think we ought to bury him.
He's dead. He's got a lot of good men
back there to keep him company.
Too damn many.
Well, I think the boys are right.
I'd like to say a few words
for the dear, dead departed.
And maybe a few hymns would be in order.
Followed by a church supper, with a choir.
You crazy bastards. Both of you.
Bishop, Engstrom, the Gorch brothers...
...amount to a total of $4500,
and you let them ride out on you.
When the hard money value of the men
you killed, less my commission...
...adds up to $500.
Any of those pelts would have not
only cleared you with the company...
...but given you a bundle of money.
We'll do better next time.
We'd do anything you say,
but we would appreciate liquor money.
There won't be any tonight.
You go after them in 10 minutes.
Get them. Get Pike, and you'll be rich.
And if one of you tries to quit on me,
I'll pay a bonus of $1000...
...to the man that kills him.
Well, let's pack our things.
- Mr. Harrigan...
- Why should I let you go?
- We've been over that.
- You might run off, might join them again.
- You'd like that.
- What I like and what I need are different.
Listen, Mr. Harrigan.
I don't wanna go back to prison.
Never again.
But it's got to be my way. I need
good men. You saw what happened.
Use what you have
and see that it doesn't happen again.
Or you'll spend your life behind bars.
- Run, I'll be after you. So will they.
- I gave my word.
Well, we'll see what it's worth.
Six minutes.
Tell me, Mr. Harrigan, how does it feel?
Getting paid for it?
Getting paid to sit back
and hire your killings...
...with the law's arms around you.
How does it feel
to be so goddamn right?
- Good.
- You dirty son of a bitch.
You've got 30 days to get Pike,
or 30 days back to Yuma.
You're my Judas goat, Mr. Thornton.
I want all of them back here,
head down over a saddle.
Thirty days to get Pike,
or 30 days back to Yuma.
I don't see nothing so lindo about it.
Just looks like more Texas,
far as I'm concerned.
You have no eyes.
We've got a half-hour of light. Let's go.
Hello, little fella.
- Them others...
- They're not coming.
- None of them?
- Nope.
- But I got horses and saddles, like you said.
- We'll need them. They won't.
Now, about the sharing up.
The sharing up
will be the same as always.
Well, me and Tector don't think that
he ought to get the same amount.
He's starting out, and this is mine
and Tector's opening for a new territory.
That's right.
And I figure a share to that old goat...
...for watching them horses
is damn sure a share too much.
So we decided...
...it ain't fair.
You two boys don't like equal shares, why
in the hell don't you just take all of it?
Why don't you answer me,
you damn yellow-livered trash?
- Now, you know...
- I don't know a damn thing...
...except I either lead this bunch
or end it right now.
All right.
We divide it up just like you say.
Chick, chick, chick, chick...
- Silver rings.
- Silver rings, your butt.
- Them is washers. Damn!
- Bastards.
Washers.
We shot our way out of that town
for a dollar's worth of steel holes.
- They set it up.
- They? Who in the hell is "they"?
They?
Why, they is just plain and fancy they.
That's who they is.
Caught you, didn't they?
Tied a tin can to your tail.
Led you in and waltzed you out again.
Oh, my, what a bunch.
Big, tough ones, eh?
Here you are with a handful of holes,
a thumb up your ass...
...and a big grin
to pass the time of day with.
"They. Who the hell is they?"
Railroad men...
...bounty hunters...
...Deke Thornton.
Deke Thornton?
He was one of them?
How in the hell
come you didn't know that?
Hey, gringo.
You can have my silver.
Come on, gringo, don't kill me.
You can have the silver.
But don't kill me, please.
Go on.
Go for it.
Fall apart.
Walk softly, boys.
What's our next move?
Well, I figure Agua Verde is the closest.
Three days maybe. We get the news
and drift back to the border.
- Maybe a payroll, maybe a bank.
- Maybe that damn railroad.
That railroad you're talking about
sure as hell ain't getting no easier.
And you boys ain't getting
any younger either.
We've gotta start thinking
beyond our guns.
Those days are closing fast.
All your fancy planning and talking
damn near got us shot to pieces...
...over a few lousy bags of washers.
This was gonna be me and Tector's last job
before we quit and headed south.
We spent all our time and money
getting ready for this.
You spent all your time and money
running whores...
...while I spent my stake setting it up.
Hell, I should have been running whores
instead of stealing Army horses.
While you was doing all that planning,
me and Tector...
...was getting our bell rope pulled
by two... Two, mind you, Hondo whores.
And Pike was dreaming of washers.
You were matching whores...
...in tandem.
- What's that?
- That's one behind the other.
That's right, that's what we was doing.
Mr. Thornton.
You rode with Pike.
What kind of man we up against?
The best.
He never got caught.
This was gonna be my last.
Ain't getting around any better.
I'd like to make one good score
and back off.
Back off to what?
Have you got anything lined up?
Pershing's got troops spread out all
along the border.
Every one of those garrisons
is gonna be getting a payroll.
That kind of information
is kind of hard to come by.
I didn't say it's gonna be easy,
but it can be done.
They'll be waiting for us.
I wouldn't have it any other way.
Come on, Pike, let's go.
You sound like you're all caught up.
Caught up enough to know
we've overstayed our welcome.
What the hell's the matter with you?
We got plenty of money...
...and not a worry in the world.
They're not gonna look for us
in their own back yard.
- How can you be so damn sure?
- Being sure is my business.
<i>Being sure is my business.</i>
Hold it!
Relax, it's just some champagne
we ordered.
<i>Relax, it's just some champagne
we ordered.</i>
<i>Being sure is my business.
Being...</i>
- Did you get him?
- No, the bastard got away.
Damn, you sure must have hurt
that railroad.
They spent a lot of money
setting up that ambush.
I caught up with them.
Two or three times.
There was a man named Harrigan.
He used to have a way of doing things.
I made him change his ways.
A hell of a lot of people, Dutch,
that just can't stand to be wrong.
- Pride.
- And they can't forget it.
That pride, being wrong. Or learn by it.
How about us, Pike?
You reckon we learned,
being wrong today?
I sure hope to God we did.
Them is hot.
Hot damn.
Where in the hell did you ever find him?
He used to run with Thornton and me.
Did his share of killing and more,
around Langtry.
Yeah, only now he does his killing
with a coffee cup.
Pike?
I wouldn't have it any other way either.
Watch out, boys.
- Take it easy, old man.
- Pull that horse up.
- Keep its head up, old man.
- What's wrong with you?
Watch him, Tector!
Goddamn son of a bitch.
- Get those horses up!
- What the hell is going...?
- Asshole clumsy bastard.
- Get up.
Get up, now. Get up there, goddamn it.
Get over here.
What in the hell's the matter
with you, old man?
Leave him alone.
He's gonna get us all killed.
I'm gonna get rid of him.
You're not getting rid of anybody. We're gonna
stick together just like it used to be.
When you side with a man, you stay
with him. If you can't, you're some animal.
You're finished!
We're finished! All of us!
Mount up.
Appears brother Pike needs help, Lyle.
Riding with Pike and Sykes
makes a man wonder if it ain't time...
...to pick up his chips
and find another game.
How in the hell are you gonna side anybody
when you can't even get on your horse?
Hey, that was a mighty fine talk you gave the
boys back there about sticking together.
That Gorch came near killing me.
Or me him.
Damned old fool like me
is not worth taking along.
- We started together. We'll end it together.
- By God, that's the way I see it.
That's the way it's always been
with me.
Sorry about Deke.
I never figured him that way.
Say, back there in Starbuck,
how'd my boy do?
Your boy? Crazy Lee?
Yeah, C.L., Clarence Lee.
My daughter's boy.
Not too bright, but a good boy.
<i>I kill them now?</i>
I kill them now?
No, you just hold them here.
Hold them here.
Why didn't you tell me
he was your grandson?
I don't know. You had enough things
on your mind.
Besides, he had to pull his own weight
just like the rest of us.
I just wanted to make sure
he didn't let you down.
Run when things got hot.
No. He did fine.
Just fine.
All clear.
From here on, it's Mexico, Mr. Thornton.
What's the closest town of any size?
Agua Verde.
- What's in Agua Verde?
- Mexicans, what else?
The headquarters for regulars fighting
against Villa. Mapache territory.
- What, don't we follow?
- No, we go back and wait.
- Damn it, Coffer, we're supposed to...
- Shut up!
Hey, Angel, why in the hell don't you tell
your folks to feed them dogs?
Won't find very much around here.
That damn Huerta scraped it clean.
I have invited you to my village,
to my home.
Any disrespect to my family
or to my people, I will kill you.
Ashamed of having us meet your people?
Yes. They don't know about my life
when I leave the village.
- You got a sister?
- Yes.
I'd be proud to make her acquaintance.
- And that of your mama too.
- That goes for your grandma too, sonny.
- How bad did they hit you?
- Seven of the villagers were killed.
Two of them hung. Our horses,
cattle and corn stolen.
Didn't the federal troops
give you any protection?
They were federal troops.
Commissioned by the traitor Huerta.
And the soldier who shot my father,
what was his name?
- What difference does it make?
- Your father died like a man.
- Names do not have any importance.
- How was he called?
- Mapache.
- That is name enough.
In Mexico, señor, these are
the years of sadness.
But if we had rifles like these...
And Teresa? Did they molest her?
She went with them
because she wished to.
She became the woman of Mapache.
And the others,
she went with them, laughing.
Drunk with wine and love.
To him, Teresa was like a goddess
to be worshiped from afar.
But Mapache knew she was a mango,
ripe and waiting.
Angel dreams of love,
and Mapache eats the mango.
Hey, that's a good trick.
Now, that I find hard to believe.
Not so hard.
We all dream of being a child again.
Even the worst of us.
Perhaps the worst most of all.
- You know what we are, then.
- Just so, the both of you.
And you.
Where is Mapache?
All right, huh, Pike? Right?
Hey, Tector, let's swap.
Come on, let's swap.
No.
You must tell me, where is Mapache?
Why do you wish to know?
For your father...
...or for the whore?
Either you learn to live with it...
...or we'll leave you here.
I go with you, jefe.
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna steal his girl.
- Steal his girl.
- You are, eh?
Here I go.
Hey, Dutch, I'm cutting in.
Come on, lady.
No gringos.
Only Federales.
All soldiers.
Not a bounty hunter in sight.
Now what in the hell is that?
I saw one just like it in Waco.
- Run on steam?
- No, on alcohol or gasoline.
Pike, you know what I heard?
I heard they got one of those things
up north that can fly.
No, that was a balloon,
you damned old fool.
No, the old man's right.
They got motors and wings,
go 60 miles in less than an hour.
Gonna use them in the war, they say.
Well, let's go and talk to the general.
About his automobile
and our extra horses.
Nice and easy.
Probably talking about us
behind our back.
Hey, I'm down to about 20 in silver.
The way the generalissimo
cleaned out this country...
- ...you'll have a lot to spare.
- Yeah, generalissimo, hell.
He's just another bandit
grabbing all he can for himself.
Like some others I could mention.
Not so as you'd know it, Mr. Bishop.
We ain't nothing like him.
We don't hang nobody.
I hope someday these people kick him
and the rest of that scum like him...
- ...into their graves.
- We will.
If it takes forever.
Well, lookie here.
- Pretty good-looking old pony, ain't he?
- Teresa.
Hey, boy, do you know them cuties?
Now, come on.
- She was my woman.
- I know. I know.
Sure ain't your woman no more.
Just look at her licking
the inside that general's ear.
No!
Why did he try to kill His Excellency?
He didn't try to kill His Excellency.
He was after the girl.
Fiancée?
He went a little crazy
when he saw her with you.
Are you men associated
with the American Army?
No.
No, we're not associated with anybody.
I see. I was curious about
the equipment which you are carrying.
That pistol is restricted
for the use of Army personnel.
It can't be purchased or even owned.
- Legally.
- Is that so?
Weapons are a specialty of mine.
I'm Commander Frederick Mohr
of the imperial German army.
It would be very useful for us
if we knew of some Americans...
...who did not share their government's
naive sentiments.
Well, we share very few sentiments
with our government.
He's asking us to have a drink with him.
Good.
Shoot him.
Bang!
I'd give it to him, T.C.
- You mean here?
- No, no, not there.
Wait a minute, now.
What you gonna do?
We've got to show a little class here.
Right here. It must be
that garrison rail spur.
I know it's the easiest to hit, but I gotta
figure some way to get it out of there.
What do you think, Dutch?
- Getting pretty close to home, ain't it?
- Look at them gathered around that table.
Here we sit like kitchen help.
Why do you want us to hit a train
at the border, huh?
Can't the general go up there
and take over?
General Huerta is anxious to better
relations with the United States...
...not to cross the border
and destroy them.
Usually these arms shipments
are kept pretty secret.
- How did you find out?
- Mapache has a superb intelligence force...
...organized under the supervision
of my commanding officer.
Now, gentlemen,
we are quite well organized...
...and well able to pay 10,000 in gold.
If you're not able to do the work,
we'll find someone else.
We can do it. We're going to need
special equipment.
Do not worry. Our accountant
will take care of everything.
Soon you will be the best-equipped general
in Mexico.
Well, lookie here. Ain't he the one.
Now, with your permission, I need a bath.
With my permission,
I think you all need a bath.
I don't need no bath.
What we need is a couple
of them women you're hogging.
You think you can fix that up
for us, boy?
Gentlemen, you will excuse me,
I am sure.
Oh, I'm sure.
Come on, let's get Angel.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Por favor, general, I need him.
I'll give you someone
much better than that.
If you don't mind,
I'll make my own choice.
All right.
He is not important to me. Take him.
I think we're gonna get
in the wagon now.
Hey, here comes our sweeties.
Ain't them pretty?
I don't know about yours, Lyle,
but I think I got more than I can handle.
Hey, get out of them weeds.
Hey, you know...?
You know what they told me?
The dons of Spain built this
over 300 years ago.
- Is that right?
- That's right.
I'll tell you, Lyle,
I'm all for them dons.
Hey, let's have a little tonic.
Hey, she ain't gonna get away.
Turn her loose.
Why not?
Hey, Tector, look at them beauties.
How in the hell can you stand it
that hot?
I'm gonna build me one of these
someday and live in it.
Damn, Lyle, lookie here.
Come on, sweetheart.
Let me see your "teatsies".
Hold on there.
I don't know why the hell
I didn't let them kill you.
Listen, I'm not going
to steal guns for that devil...
- ...to rob and kill my people again.
- Noble, noble. Very noble.
I didn't see no tears roll down your cheek
when you rode in from Starbuck.
They were not my people.
I care about my people, my village.
- Mexico.
- Listen, boy.
You ride with us,
your village don't count.
- If it does, you just don't go along.
- Then I don't go along.
Angel, one load of guns ain't gonna
stop them raiding villages.
You ought to think about the money
you're gonna have.
Buy them a ranch.
Move them a thousand miles.
- Buy them two, three ranches.
- One.
- A very small one.
- Don't you see, this is their land.
- And no one is gonna drive them away.
- I'll drink to that sentiment...
...and to love.
But most of all, I'll drink to gold.
Angel...
...you're a pain in the ass.
Would you give guns to someone
to kill your father...
...or your mother or your brother?
Ten thousand cuts an awful lot
of family ties.
My people have no guns.
But with guns, my people could fight.
If I could take guns...
...I would go with you.
Say, how many cases of rifles
did Zamorra say was in that shipment?
Sixteen.
Well...
...give him one.
All right.
One case, and one case of ammo.
But you give up your share of the gold.
- I will.
- We know you will.
Sure glad we got that settled.
Why, you reprobate.
Boys...
...I want you to meet my fiancée.
- They just got engaged.
- Well, I'm a son of a bitch.
Trot them right in, fellas.
I'm hell on packing mules,
but I'm a delight with a pretty girl.
You want to gamble everything
that this shipment will be attacked?
If they are in Agua Verde,
they'll try for it.
- If? What about Juárez?
- Because we would have heard about it.
If they are in Agua Verde,
they will have seen Mapache.
And who in hell is Mapache?
A killer for Huerta who calls himself a
general. He's been fighting Villa and losing.
But with enough guns, he could
become a power in northern Mexico.
- Pike will try to get them for him.
- The train will be guarded by regular troops.
Not regular troops. Green recruits.
Not worth a damn.
I need 20 trained men, not recruits.
And not this...
...gutter trash you've given me.
What you've got is 24 more days.
Never told me how you got
all tore up like that.
Met a woman I wanted to marry.
- Is your husband coming back?
- No.
He's never coming back.
But you are late. Two days late.
She had a husband.
If I'd had any sense, I'd have killed him.
<i>He wasn't around. I got careless.</i>
<i>One night, he walked in on us,
got her with the first shot...</i>
<i>...got me here with the second.</i>
<i>Then the damn coward turned and ran.</i>
Ever catch up with him?
No, but there isn't a day or an hour
that passes that I don't think about it.
Come on, Freddy, we've got a long way.
This is our last go-around, Dutch.
This time, we do it right.
Just do your work.
Hey.
Let's go.
They're coming!
Faster.
Get over.
- Give them a hand.
- Get that ramp up!
Get that horse out of here!
Bring them all out!
Get them out! Get over there!
Line up!
Get some order here! Get those horses!
- Hurry up.
- Your horse kicked me, Marvin.
Run them up along here.
Where the hell is my horse?
- Hey, we got grenades.
- Hurry up, we gotta get out of here.
Careful with this, boys.
All right, let's go on this.
All right, here we go.
All right, line up in a column of twos.
And hurry!
Corporal, give us a hand here.
Hey, Pike. We're all ready.
Let's go.
Get after that horse.
Hey, that was my horse. Get after him!
- Marvin...
- You men, get out...
Get that damn horse off my foot!
Get those horses out of here.
The train is coming back.
- Train! Train's coming back!
- Where?
What train? I don't see any train.
Get out!
- Get your goddamn horse off my foot!
- Get them out.
Hey, see! See!
Corporal, ride back to the telegraph
at Todos Malos...
...and tell them the railroad deputies
robbed the train and we are in pursuit.
Yes, sir.
You son of a... Come on.
Dutch.
Goddamn son of a...
Come on! It's lit!
It's out!
Get those horses going!
Don't shoot. It's the Army, you idiots!
Come on! Come on, you...
Come on, Pike!
My God.
Let's go.
- Come on, you lazy bastard.
- I'm coming, damn it.
- Is it all right?
- Yep.
- Where are they supposed to meet us?
- Agua Verde or before.
But when we do meet them,
don't expect any open arms.
At least we won't have to worry
about Deke Thornton.
Hell, no. Not after riding a half of case
of dynamite into the river.
Well, don't expect him to stay there.
He'll be along, and you know it.
I sure would like to get hold
of that fool horse of mine.
Some Mexican is probably
riding him home right now.
I don't see how
I could have lost both my boots.
They always was
hard as hell to get on.
- That damn river sucked them right off.
- That damn dynamite helped some.
Maybe the same kid that's riding T.C.'s
horse is wearing your boots right now.
You stupid bastards.
Why did you fire at those soldiers?
It was Huey started firing at them.
I even tried to stop him.
- Well, no, Jess...
- T.C., don't blame it on me.
Shut your mouth!
- Are we going after them?
- We are.
Unless you wanna go back
and face a firing squad.
- Why did you tell...?
- Come on, T.C.
Why do we have to leave right now?
Besides, my hair's wet.
I don't wanna catch a cold.
Impossible.
We have no arms or ammunition.
The gringos assaulted the train.
They got the guns.
General, we must go.
Take the necessary people
and take the road to Agua Verde.
Convince the gringos
to give you the guns.
If the gringo refuse?
Still heading east.
Are they bluffing,
or did they really miss it?
I'd say they missed it. Here, take a look.
He has only five left.
- Hell, we lost them.
- I don't see how we lost them.
Unless it was in that valley
where the ground was hard.
There wasn't but one way they could take
a wagon out of there, and this here is it.
They didn't take it out.
And we haven't lost them.
I could point to them now.
Sit still, damn it.
Think Pike and Sykes
haven't been watching us?
They know what this is all about.
And what do I have?
Just you egg-sucking,
chicken-stealing gutter trash...
...with not even 60 rounds between you.
We're after men.
And I wish to God I was with them.
The next time you make a mistake,
I'm gonna ride off and let you die.
Come on.
I never figured they'd come down here
after us.
- How much you reckon we can be worth?
- Depends on how hungry they are.
You better stay here
and look out for big hats.
I'll go down
and start rigging the fireworks.
Right.
Angel.
Get that case of explosives
off the back there.
Lyle.
Hand me down those blasting caps.
What are you gonna do
with the dynamite?
I figure that general will try
to take this load without paying...
...and shoot us in the bargain.
The thing that would change his mind
is something happening to the guns.
I'm gonna make sure something
could happen.
- Hey, Pike, take a look at this.
- Think you can handle that?
What I don't know about,
I sure as hell am gonna learn.
My people are here for their guns.
Where were you when you were
supposed to guard us?
I never heard them.
Didn't even see them.
They apologize and ask you to forgive
them for their lack of trust.
But only by caution
do they remain alive.
Tell them not to break that fuse.
These people from your village?
They are a part of the village,
but not from it.
<i>They are puro Indio,</i>
and these mountains belong to them.
Now, I'd say those fellas
know how to handle themselves.
They've been fighting Apaches for
1000 years. That's a sure way to learn.
They ever get armed, with good leaders,
this country will go up in smoke.
That it will, son. That it will.
They made damn fools out of us,
Mr. Bishop.
Getting so a fella can't sleep with both eyes
closed for fear of getting his throat cut.
- Where in the hell were you?
- Now, you listen to me, Lyle...
...if you'd help once in a while,
I wouldn't have got caught near so easy.
With the new guns and ammunition,
this could never have happened.
Swing your leaders wide, old man.
Bring them all.
Come on, you...
Giddyup, there! Giddyup! Come on.
Hold up.
Mapache's?
Let's just hope they don't belong
to Villa.
We are friends.
We are from El general Mapache.
Tell the one out in front
to come over here. Alone.
I am coming.
I am your friend, remember?
We are friends. All of us.
I bring you love
and affection from El general.
Hey, you bring the guns with you, huh?
Bravo. Bravo.
What bravery you have done.
I am to escort you to the general.
- Tell him to come closer.
- I hear.
I am coming, my friend.
You know what this is?
Any trouble, no guns for the general.
Very smart.
That's very smart for you, damn gringos.
So nobody can rob the guns.
- Nobody.
- I am not afraid. They are not afraid.
You blow up the wagon, you die.
Or we kill you pretty soon.
- But we are amigos.
- Show them, boys.
Start the ball, Tector.
Please cut the fuse.
Please.
El general waits in Agua Verde
to meet with you.
Tell the general one of us
will be there to trade tomorrow.
Any trouble, no guns.
Damn gringos.
Get them up there, Freddy.
Get them over.
Giddyup there! Giddyup.
Come on. Come on.
Gringo, you bring the guns?
Don't worry, we've got them.
Hidden.
When I get my share of the gold, $2500
worth, I'll tell you where four cases are.
The others are waiting for me
back at the wagon.
If I don't show up pretty quick,
they'll blow it.
You fix it goddamn good, no?
You fool me.
Our accountant
will pay you immediately.
When do we get our guns?
The quicker I get back,
the quicker you get the next load.
Open it up.
Up the arroyo about two miles...
...you'll find three cases of rifles...
...and one case of ammunition
in the bush behind them.
I understand you have a machine gun.
Our contract called for 16 cases of rifles
and ammunition for $10,000...
...not a machine gun.
That's our present to the general.
Gringo, you fight with Mapache...
I'll think about it.
In case he don't find them...
Go. I trust him.
- Why the hell don't you stir up some grub?
- Why in the hell don't you go to hell?
Shit.
Damn it. Why...
Damn it! Pike must have found you
under a rock.
You gonna whip me?
Nope. But you better just hope
I don't get riled enough...
...to start dogging you
when this is over.
You're not gonna get a chance
to dry-gulch me, old man.
We'll see. We'll see.
Pike's coming.
He's got it. Carrying gold.
- Any trouble?
- Just from carrying this weight.
- Pike, I wanna go next.
- All right.
You and your brother take the next load and
the machine gun. Then Angel and Dutch.
Freddy, you follow
and pick up the packhorses.
It must be mounted on a tripod.
Put it on the tripod.
We brought the last of it, general.
At the head of the arroyo,
in the wagon.
You can have the wagon.
We'll take the horses.
How many cases
did you take from the train?
Sixteen cases of rifles.
We lost one on the trail.
He stole it.
The mother of the girl he killed
told me so.
Well, I'm wasting time here. Adiós.
He's a thief. You take care of him.
Well, he had guts.
We're just lucky he didn't talk.
He played his string
right out to the end.
Her own mama turned him in,
like some kind of a Judas.
Sykes says we ought to go after him.
How in the hell are we gonna do that?
They got guns and 200 men.
No way.
No way at all.
Is that Sykes?
Mapache.
Thornton.
I got him. I got him.
They got Freddy.
- It looks like he's hit pretty bad.
- Damn that Deke Thornton to hell.
What would you do in his place?
He gave his word.
- Gave his word to a railroad.
- It's his word.
That ain't what counts!
It's who you give it to.
We can stay up here and kick
hell out of them. That's what we can do.
No. We're running short of water.
Make a run for the border?
They'd follow us every step of the way.
I know Thornton.
I'm tired of being hunted.
Let's go back to Agua Verde.
Let the general take care of those boys.
You're crazy.
That general would as soon kill us
as break wind.
He's so tickled with those guns,
he'll be celebrating...
...and happy to do us a favor.
Thornton's not gonna follow us in there.
While they're busy picking over Freddy...
...we'll find a back trail off
this mountain and head for town.
What about our gold?
We'll take one sack to pay our way.
Bury the rest.
Together.
Look out there, Jess.
Lots of blood. Then it stops. No tracks.
- Ten dollars says he's dead by now.
- Take us a day to find him if he is.
If he isn't, he's holding a gun on us
right now.
- Let's go after the others.
- Just leave him here? He's worth money.
Jess, you ride out tomorrow,
if you can stay on your horse.
Watch the buzzards.
They'll show you where he is.
What if he ain't dead, Mr. Thornton?
That's your problem. Let's go.
- God, I hate to see that.
- No more than I do.
Welcome, amigos.
You come for your friend, no?
I wanna buy him back.
I don't think he looks worth too much.
- I don't think he's gonna live too long.
- I'll give you half my share for him.
- I need no gold. And I don't sell this one.
- Why not? You've had your fun with him.
El general is the most happy with the guns.
Why don't you go and get a drink?
Enjoy yourself. There are women
everywhere.
Don't be foolish and change his mood.
Son of a bitch.
Why not?
Hell, there ain't nobody here.
There's wagon tracks,
and somebody was here!
They sure as hell ain't here now.
Army patrol! Coming this way!
You said dos for two!
Here's your dos and one to grow on.
And that's all you're gonna get
out of me.
Let's go.
Why not?
What do you want?
We want Angel.
You want Angel, no? All right,
I am going to give it to you.
Come get it, you bastards!
Bitch!
Come on, you lazy bastard!
Give them hell, Pike!
No! Pike! Pike!
Pike. Pike.
Pike.
- Look at them!
- Let me see.
Come on. Come on.
Hey, fellas, wait up for me.
- I get all the guns.
- This one's mine.
Boy, this is just like
a big old picnic!
- Hey, Rossy, here's a rifle for you.
- You must have something on you.
T.C., it's them!
It's the Gorches!
- Get up there, Coffer.
- I'm getting. Mr. Thornton, it's them.
It is them.
Here's a boy with gold in his teeth.
Let me see your knife.
- Here.
- Well, let me see your knife!
Mr. Thornton.
Shall we load up?
We gonna wait for Jess
or meet him on the way?
If he's waiting for buzzards to lead him
to old Sykes, he's got a long wait.
- Look at them.
- We got them all!
T.C., there he is. There's Pike.
Yeah, you ain't so damn much now,
are you, Mr. Pike?
You ain't coming?
No.
- Maybe we ought to wait here for Jess.
- No, no.
We pick him up on the way.
I wanna get out of this damn place.
These boys will start going ripe on us
by tomorrow. We gotta move.
Hey, Jess!
Jess.
Giddyup there!
- Didn't expect to find you here.
- Why not?
I sent them back.
- That's all I said I'd do.
- They didn't get very far.
I figured.
What are your plans?
Drift around down here.
Try to stay out of jail.
Well, me and the boys here,
we got some work to do.
You wanna come along?
It ain't like it used to be...
...but it'll do.
