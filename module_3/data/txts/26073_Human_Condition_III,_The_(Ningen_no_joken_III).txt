PART 5
Right smack in enemy territory.
What do we do now?
One of two things:
We could run for it...
Through those headlights?
What's the other choice?
If we could distract him
for just 30 seconds,
we could cut across here.
Kaji, can't you
shoot him from here?
While you run for it?
Nice idea,
but what happens to me?
What else can we do?
You're the bayonet expert.
Sneak up and stab him.
What do we do?
What are you going to do?
If they catch me,
just start running.
Sir, look! Blood!
<i>Fighting those Soviet troops...</i>
<i>I was responsible</i>
<i>only for isolated shots</i>
<i>amid countless millions</i>
<i>of rounds fired.</i>
<i>But this morning...</i>
<i>Michiko...</i>
<i>I'm a murderer.</i>
<i>These hands</i>
<i>that once caressed you</i>
<i>killed a man in cold blood.</i>
<i>Just to cross the road</i>
<i>to safety!</i>
<i>Was I justified?</i>
<i>Or was it wanton murder?</i>
<i>Michiko...</i>
<i>will you decide for me?</i>
Sir.
Sir, tell me how you did it.
Don't ask useless questions!
It got us across that road.
Concentrate on what
lies ahead instead.
Where you headed?
We hope to get to Mutankiang.
It's that way.
But you're wasting your time.
The enemy got there first.
Really?
What about yourself?
I'm headed for Korea.
Closer to home
than Manchuria.
And your unit?
I had one until yesterday.
Watch out for
the Korean-Manchurian border.
It's controlled by Kim II Sung.
Is that right?
Then I'll just be another Red.
What's "comrade"
in Chinese and Korean?
It's <i>tongzhi</i> in Chinese.
In Korean I think it's <i>tongmu.</i>
<i>Tongzhi</i> and <i>tongmu,</i> eh?
Thanks.
That's all I'll need.
See ya.
<i>Tongzhi</i> and <i>tongmu,</i> eh?
You look strong and healthy,
my <i>tongzhi!</i>
A real crackpot.
Probably a deserter, the rat!
Should've gotten
his name and rank.
What for?
To report him later.
Fool.
You calling me a fool?
I only let you take charge
because you know this area.
I'm still an NCO.
I won't be insulted!
As long as you're with me,
I give the orders.
Forget about rank.
While we're at it,
let's get something else clear.
You listen too, Terada.
I didn't expect Mutankiang
to fall so soon.
The Kwangtung Army
must essentially be wiped out...
so I'm no longer concerned
about rejoining them.
Then what do we do?
We go back to our former lives.
South Manchuria
lies in that direction.
My former life awaits me there.
And I'll do my best
to get you back
to your former lives.
If you don't agree,
we can part ways now.
We decide right here.
How about it?
We'll run into friendly
forces somewhere.
Whoever wants to
can join them.
Not "whoever wants to" -
it's our duty!
You can't just ignore
the soldier's code.
What we need now
is the defeated man's code.
If you want to go on soldiering,
take Terada and go.
I'm going this way.
Kaji, will we ever
get out of here?
We walk and walk,
but it's all the same.
It's been two days.
- We have no map or compass.
- We've followed you -
We'll get nowhere unless
we keep walking - I know that.
We're out of my territory.
It must be a river!
A river!
You're our saviors.
It's like meeting
Buddha in hell.
Thank goodness. My breasts
will be full of milk tonight.
Soldier, we've hardly eaten
in five days.
Divide this among yourselves.
What do you think?
Do we take them along?
I'm considering it.
We can't very well leave them.
This is all the food
we have left.
I'll keep that from now on.
- I'm not taking it all!
- I wouldn't put it beyond you!
The soldiers didn't say
it was just for you.
You didn't bring any rations
when you joined us.
Can't you behave?
Coming on to the soldiers!
We shared with you
at the cost of our babies' milk.
Whores!
So what if we are?
We'll let the soldiers decide.
They won't share with us
because we're prostitutes.
What's wrong with them?
They've mooched off us
ever since we escaped.
You ran to us when the Russians
were going to rape your women.
Enough!
We'll all share.
If you want to argue,
we leave you behind.
Oh, for a dumpling
the size of a woman's rear end!
I'd settle for a bellyful
of cold rice and miso soup.
Soldiers, please don't go on
about food anymore.
You're right.
It just makes us hungrier.
Kaji, aren't these edible?
They're snails.
Mmm, it's good!
It may not be beef, ma'am,
but it's fine once you swallow.
He's right.
Let's try a little.
If only the Kwangtung Army
had done its job.
They were all so tough
until the fighting started.
We fought!
We're the only three left
out of 160 men.
Fine, but couldn't they have
evacuated the women and children?
We went out of our way
to cooperate with the army.
And made a tidy profit, eh?
Speak for yourself!
Please, can't you keep
that baby quiet?
Get some sleep.
Arguing won't get us any food.
Mommy!
You can't eat those!
Your next nap
will be your last.
You soldiers are lucky.
You don't have children.
We can't keep up with you.
Soldiers, no matter how far we go,
we'll never find our paradise.
That's not my fault.
PFC Kaji's got a bit of paradise
left in his pouch.
- What happened to the others?
- Who cares?
Damn it! They just keep
holding us back.
Kaji, let's cook
the rest of the rice.
No, not until we know
we can find our way out
or we're ready
to lie down and die.
You all right?
Don't give up.
You waited for us?
You're tougher than I expected.
Well, if you men desert us,
we're finished.
Come on,
just a little further.
I won't let you die by yourself.
I'm sorry we're so slow.
Age is such a burden.
We'll just walk
until we can't anymore.
I'll always be at your side.
Who's that?
You're not
the only one starving.
If I don't eat, my baby will die.
And my husband!
Just like the rest of us!
Just a little
for my baby and husband.
I won't take any for myself.
No.
If you're so hungry,
eat the grass!
My baby will die.
My baby...
will die!
I don't know
who among us will survive...
but this rice is for them,
not for the dying.
You going to eat it alone?
If we don't find our way out tomorrow,
we'll all be dead anyway.
Stay alive if you want to eat.
Now shut up and sleep.
<i>Somebody help!</i>
<i>My baby!</i>
What'll I do?
My baby's dead!
Someone help me!
Call a doctor!
Shut up!
We're all dying.
How about your husband?
Somebody do something!
It's driving me crazy!
Let her cry it out.
Let's push on
or we'll all die!
Come on, get up! Get up!
We have to go on!
Shut up!
Well, no <i>yakitori</i> for dinner.
Some marksman.
Sorry.
My eyes are failing.
Where are the others?
The teacher...
told us to go on ahead.
And the merchant's family?
They suddenly
doubled up in pain
and vomited
what looked like blood.
Toadstools?
If you want to kill yourselves,
take my gun.
Anyone else eat that stuff?
Sure. It looked good.
They ate some.
We don't need
any more help from you.
We'll live or die
as we please.
Let me bury the child.
Carrying it around
won't bring it back to life.
You killed this child!
They died like flies today.
Where's your family?
What's it to you?
Nothing. Just asking.
I put 'em out of their misery.
Seems we weren't
the only ones lost in here.
I won't give up!
Can we make it out?
We'll know tomorrow.
We caught them.
We're entitled to keep one.
No, we share equally.
You couldn't even hit that bird,
so don't play squad leader.
We're eating one.
Just try it.
I missed the bird,
but I won't miss you.
You're not the only one
who can use a rifle!
Stop it!
Stop acting like children.
You're right.
What's gotten into us?
Kaji, we'll share the snake
if you'll ration out the rice.
Wait till tomorrow morning.
Tomorrow...
will we make it out of here?
I don't know.
But here's how I look at it:
When my unit was wiped out,
shells burst right in front of me,
but I survived.
So I don't think
I'll die in this forest.
So if I stick with you,
I won't die either.
I'd like you to think so.
<i>Wherever you go,</i>
<i>I will always be with you.</i>
<i>Always!</i>
We'll have to walk
long and hard tomorrow.
I wonder how things are
in south Manchuria.
I have a sister there.
My only living kin.
She's not like me.
Is that where you're going?
Will you take me there?
I hope south Manchuria
is still safe.
It has to be.
This is the last of it.
I'm breaking out of this forest today
come what may.
I won't stop until I reach
homes or farmland.
Stick with me
if you don't want to die.
<i>Shit!</i>
<i>He's a fast walker!</i>
<i>I'd keep up with him</i>
<i>if I weren't injured.</i>
<i>Kaji, you called me</i>
<i>a fool once.</i>
<i>I won't forget that.</i>
<i>You also saved me</i>
<i>from those tanks.</i>
<i>I won't forget that either.</i>
<i>What kind of guy</i>
<i>are you anyway?</i>
<i>Shit!</i>
<i>The bastard!</i>
<i>Where does that dog</i>
<i>get all that energy anyway?</i>
<i>Damn! If we find friendly forces,</i>
<i>I'll be disgraced!</i>
<i>A full corporal taking orders</i>
<i>from a private!</i>
<i>I should've died</i>
<i>a hero's death in action.</i>
<i>I'd be in a fancy coffin</i>
<i>at Yasukuni Shrine.</i>
<i>Fools!</i>
<i>We'll never make it out</i>
<i>of these woods.</i>
<i>Help will come when it comes.</i>
<i>To hell with this. I give up!</i>
What do you think, boss?
I think he's taking us
in the wrong direction.
He's heading for Vladivostok.
I couldn't care less.
I'm giving up.
We'll be left behind.
Ume-chan, get up!
Let me be...
<i>Can I keep walking?</i>
<i>Where am I headed anyway?</i>
<i>All this walking...</i>
<i>is it just a waste of time?</i>
<i>Has south Manchuria become</i>
<i>just another mass grave</i>
<i>for the Japanese?</i>
<i>Maybe there's nowhere left</i>
<i>for the Japanese to go.</i>
<i>Wait! Don't kill her!</i>
<i>I'm coming back</i>
<i>to face charges.</i>
<i>Michiko...</i>
<i>are you still alive?</i>
<i>Do you realize</i>
<i>that I'm walking like this</i>
<i>to return to your side?</i>
Will we reach farmland today?
Terada!
What's that?
What do you think it is?
A house?
Other human beings!
A house - it has to be!
Wait, it's too soon to rejoice.
We'll wait here for the others.
- Ushijima Unit from Seiundai?
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>
The Doi work party?
Yes, sir.
Ushijima Battalion
was wiped out.
What happened
to Lieutenant Doi?
Killed in action, sir.
Then why are you still alive?
Why didn't you press on
in a final attack?
Your commanders are dead,
yet you dare live on?
You must be deserters.
And bringing a woman along -
such indiscretion! Explain yourself!
I offer no explanation.
You deny our request for food?
I do!
My unit's to make a final stand
at the Korean-Manchurian border.
We have no supplies
for cowards.
Now get out of here!
Loiter here
and we'll hang you all.
Captain Nagata, was it?
Keep your food
and your damned lectures.
I'll blow your head off!
Nobody move!
Terada and Hikita,
shoot anyone who moves.
Look at these idiots in full battle dress!
What "final stand"!
If you don't want
to give us food, just say so!
Our men were wiped out
so you could run! I'll blow you to bits!
Kaji, while we were scaring
those filthy rats,
we should've filched
some supplies.
To hell with supplies!
That bastard!
Corporal Hironaka,
those are the friendly forces
you wanted to join.
And that slob was a captain!
Someone's coming.
Nice work, Kaji.
Remember me?
Tange!
That's right. It's Tange.
You scared the hell out of me,
firing at us like that.
Look at that beard.
You've sure changed.
When it's kill or be killed,
you change.
Well, we can talk later.
Eat some of this.
It's not over yet, is it?
It must be.
If it does end,
what will be the outcome?
Like Germany:
Unconditional surrender.
That's probably true,
but I mean after that.
What about guys like us?
I mean,
what happens to the people?
That's the big question.
If we lose, wouldn't
our country be wiped out?
Our country?
What's that?
The country you were taught
to know will be dead...
and that's how it should be.
We've been struggling
to survive...
to see if a country can
take its place where men are free.
That's the big question.
I hope democratic forces
will unite to cope
with this defeat.
"Democratic forces" -
is there such a thing in Japan?
Japan's full of helpless creatures
like myself... or worse.
They can do nothing.
Why so bitter?
The test is yet to come.
That's not the point.
We became soldiers...
and fought in battle.
We were wiped out,
and now we plod along.
We killed,
and we deserted our buddies.
"Cope with defeat,"
you say.
How many of us are even
capable or worthy of that?
That's enough.
Even your ideals seem starved.
I found a corn field!
He's fast asleep.
He seems greatly relieved
ever since you joined us.
Seems he had it rough.
But I'm amazed
at how you've kept up with him.
You've got guts.
- It's not guts. It's desperation.
I can't tell you how often
I felt like giving up.
But though he acts so cold,
this man's been very kind to me.
I must keep on
to learn how my sister is doing.
- Where is she?
- Taishihkiao.
That's near Kaji's place.
Yes, that's why
I'm sticking with him.
Now our only worry
is overeating, not starving.
Dog!
Stop that!
What are you doing?
Stand up!
We mean you no harm.
We just wish to ask our way.
Have any Russians
come this way?
The bastard's pretending
he's deaf.
We just want to return home.
Which way is Jinpohu?
Good. Thank you.
Damn! We were tricked!
That dog!
I should've shot him.
They hate us because
our troops raid their fields.
It's strange.
How come they're armed?
It can't just be guns
from our stragglers.
Maybe they formed
their own peasant militia.
Let's get out of here.
No, we'd be surrounded.
Watch for a chance
to make a dash for it.
You came just in time.
Our scouts blundered,
and things have gotten nasty.
Front-line unit?
More like "wiped-out unit."
You fought hard then!
What do you think
of this plan?
They're searching over there.
You cover us from here
while we make
a run for those woods.
Then we'll cover you from there.
Sounds good...
but not for us.
Why not?
Where are your scouts?
See those four or five men?
That's where they got them.
Shut up!
You didn't go help them?
With these few men?
I'd hate to find you couldn't
help us either once you got across.
I'll stay here with your men
to provide cover.
Tange and the others
will go first and then cover us.
We'll cooperate
on those terms.
Meaning you don't trust us?
Wait a minute.
Why not wait till dark?
Impossible.
They've already spotted us.
We can't lose this chance.
You may be right.
Tighten your laces!
Let's go!
Fire at random
just to pin 'em down!
It's our turn. Let's go!
Come on!
- Does it hurt?
- Not too bad.
Damn! I'm dead tired!
That damned Ujiie
finally got his!
They got him?
Those bastards
are having a field day!
Their militia seems to indicate
that the war must be over.
If so, they'd announce it
and urge us to surrender.
Would they just come after us?
Would you surrender?
No.
Of course not!
Being POWs
would cramp our style.
We may be paying dearly
for our worthless freedom.
Damn, it's freezing!
If you'd listened to me,
we'd be by a fireplace
dreaming about dames right now.
He gets scared every time
we get near civilians.
We don't have to be so afraid
of a few Chinks with guns.
You okay?
Yes, except for the shivering.
Does your leg hurt?
It's only pain.
Now I appreciate
the value of a roof overhead.
<i>I never realized it before,</i>
<i>but now I understand.</i>
<i>Know what I'm talking about?</i>
<i>It's so nice to have a home</i>
<i>to protect you from wind and rain.</i>
<i>Michiko...</i>
<i>our happiness was an illusion.</i>
<i>For the joys we shared</i>
<i>at the cost of Chinese sacrifices,</i>
<i>I am now paying dearly.</i>
<i>What's more,</i>
<i>I must kill and steal</i>
<i>to fight my way back to you.</i>
<i>Michiko...</i>
<i>will you and I ever get</i>
<i>a chance to start anew?</i>
No village in sight.
Strange.
Shall we rest here?
Those pigs look good.
Doesn't seem unoccupied.
There's probably no danger.
We sleep under a roof at last!
We'll stop here to rest.
Great! I'll get a pig.
The aroma of steaming fat reminds me
of that Russian place, eh, Fukumoto?
What a joint!
It was great!
They had honey,
and all the meat you wanted.
White female flesh too.
What a jackass!
The gal spreads her legs wide,
and he stands there shaking!
You lucky dogs!
Just about then we were
eating snails in the woods.
<i>Cut out the bragging.</i>
Touch a woman while you're
with me and I'll shoot you.
Who gives a shit about
white or Chink dames anyway?
They're raping our women.
It's war.
An eye for an eye.
These guys don't realize
who they're talking to.
I can guess.
Then stop being
such a wet blanket.
You have to enjoy the moment.
That's an awful wound!
It's healed now.
Kaji cauterized it
with gunpowder during the battle.
He did, did he?
Hey, sister,
want me to scrub you down?
Nice ass!
- Cut it out!
That ass must be
itching by now.
It's a bit baffling,
this oasis for rejects
from the outside world like us.
Let's go outside.
It's depressing in here.
Let's call the men
and get out of here.
It's dangerous wherever we go.
Why not relax the reins a bit?
Am I too hard on them?
You're not satisfied
until you've dragged everyone else
up to your own level.
Of course...
that's probably
why you're alive today.
We're moving on.
Hurry up and get out.
I'm undressing.
- Don't mind me.
Never seen a naked woman?
You've gone a long time without it too.
What do you say?
Who'd want to do it with you?
I can't pay, but you're not
worth that much anyway, so come on.
Come on! How about it?
Touch me and I'll scream!
What are you doing undressing here?
It's dangerous!
Why don't you mind
your own business?
Go back
and get ready to leave.
You can complain later.
Stop teasing the men.
I wasn't teasing them.
The tension eases and you ladies
are back to your old tricks.
"You ladies"?
Stop acting so big.
I happen to prefer his type.
I don't care who you prefer.
There's danger everywhere.
One wrong move
could mean trouble for us all.
Then I won't
trouble you anymore.
You'll see.
That's enough!
The dog!
He was spying on us.
Maybe he lives here.
Maybe we ate his pig.
That's quite a coup for you.
Lucky I was taking
a crap out there
or we'd be in hot water now.
Is this your house?
Yes.
I'm sorry we killed your pig.
The hell you are!
What gives with you two?
Son of a bitch!
Break through that wall!
Over here!
They're moving in.
Hurry up!
All right.
Let's go!
Will PFC Kaji be all right?
What'll we do
if something happens to him?
We'll manage.
The man's not God.
It's not like we don't know
east from west.
From here on...
I quit running and start fighting.
They can kill you and me
if they want.
But why civilians?
And a woman?
They're on edge just like us.
You think that's an excuse?
That kind of thinking
justifies anything.
He was still alive
with his guts hanging out.
I put him out of his misery.
Bastards!
What a horrible way to die.
Where are the others?
Out there somewhere.
Go find them, would you?
I'll bury the girl.
- I'll take care of the others.
- Manchus?
Any objections?
If you can bury the girl,
you can bury
the Manchus too.
But I'll do it for you.
I hope we can
make it to that cornfield.
If we're trapped in here,
we've had it.
Here they come.
- Sir!
- Calm down. They're still far off.
Seems we're not the only Japanese
stragglers. What do we do?
Can't let our goose
be cooked with theirs.
In any case,
let's keep moving.
They pillaged this place good.
The Chinese are out for revenge.
We can't get caught up
in this mess.
Damn!
Now we're really in trouble.
What do we do?
We'll never get out of here.
We'll never make it.
- We're doomed!
- We didn't do anything!
Oh, we didn't?
Smoke from the rear, sir!
Let's run for it this way!
It's no use.
They'll get us as we come out.
No one will get out alive.
Looks like the end
of the road, boys.
Let's surrender.
Fool!
Because they smoked us out?
They didn't ask us to surrender.
They mean to smoke us out
and kill us!
Team up!
We're going through the fire line.
Can't be many guns past that.
Terada! Come on!
Terada, come on!
That was a close one!
We'll lie low here until dark.
We made it...
but I don't approve
of your methods.
And we lost another man.
Hironaka?
I'm not blaming you.
I understand.
At the railroad we'll find out
what's happened.
Every man can choose for himself.
We'll part there.
Looks like Japanese refugees.
Mostly women,
judging from their clothes.
Should we call to them?
No, let's watch
a bit longer.
What happened?
Don't look!
I can't believe it.
The Red Army
wouldn't mistreat civilians.
Not any civilians -
just Japanese women.
And the Manchus squeal on us
to the Russians.
The prison convoys
are a sickening sight.
Any woman will do.
Nothing's more pitiful than
the women of a defeated nation.
<i>Of course there must be scoundrels</i>
<i>in the Red Army too.</i>
<i>A handful among the millions.</i>
<i>A few dozen</i>
<i>or a few hundred like that</i>
<i>don't undermine the theory of the Red-</i>
<i>no - the People's Army.</i>
<i>A flaw of the transition period</i>
<i>that will surely be corrected.</i>
<i>The Red Army should be different</i>
<i>from the Japanese or the Nazis.</i>
<i>Fundamentally different</i>
<i>even from the American army.</i>
<i>Minor incidents</i>
<i>from a historical standpoint</i>
<i>can be of vital importance</i>
<i>to the individual.</i>
<i>For those who've seen such failings,</i>
<i>the scars never heal.</i>
<i>The blood of hatred will continue</i>
<i>to ooze from the wounds,</i>
<i>forming a breeding ground</i>
<i>for distrust that can't be wiped out.</i>
<i>A trivial event perhaps,</i>
<i>but also a stain on humanity.</i>
<i>How can you defend such a thing?</i>
The Reds further south
were probably like that too.
I still have faith.
Soldiers...
are you headed
for south Manchuria?
We were visiting our uncle
when hostilities broke out.
Where are your parents?
I don't know.
You two are making
your way to Korea?
No, back to Peihutow,
though we're not sure
what we'll find.
Will you take us with you?
Even Nanhutow
would be good enough.
How old are you?
Eighteen.
We move fast.
We can keep up.
We have this far.
You had no trouble on the way?
We had some tough geisha with us.
They sacrificed themselves for us.
And where are they now?
They were taken away.
They say the kid went mad
when the Russians pointed a gun at him
and he saw them
raping his sister.
Shut up!
I'm sorry you have to rest
so often for our sake.
Why do you make
your sister do everything?
He'll perk up
when we get home.
I can't let
anything happen to him
before we get back
to our parents.
If feels great.
You should try it.
I don't usually look like this.
Much better. Very pretty.
Is Jinpohu very far off?
No, not far.
Go straight
and you'll reach Nanhutow.
Where are you headed?
Back to Korea.
How are things in Peihutow?
My village is
only 12 miles from there,
but I really couldn't say.
I don't think
there are still people there.
All the Japanese farmers
have already left the area.
You follow this lakeshore
to Hutow, right?
Yes. It's about 24 miles.
Can you two
make it on your own?
Yes, I think we'll be all right.
I've been thinking about
what that Korean peasant told us.
Even if you go back,
you may find
your father and mother gone.
It may not be wise
to press on.
If you have no place to go,
why not come with me?
I don't know what's left
where I'm headed either...
but you could continue searching
from there or return to Japan.
Wouldn't that be wiser?
I'd rather try
my own home first.
If my parents are gone,
we still have Chinese friends there.
I have to see for myself.
I'll take them.
How about it, Fukumoto?
If her parents are there,
we can relax there a while.
What do you say, sister?
I'm sick of walking.
We'll rest a while
and then plan our next step.
What if there are
no Japanese there?
Then maybe
we'll join the guerrillas
and make her our leader.
They're sure walking fast.
They're in a hurry to get home.
If her home is gone,
this detour may be for nothing.
Leave it to me.
I'll figure out something.
Damn, she has a nice ass!
It's strange.
They come after us
with fire and antitank guns,
yet they overlook
spots like this.
A paradise for the defeated.
Hey, buddy! What unit?
Remnants of the border unit.
Damn! We really lost?
We were all dragged into this
by a slip of paper.
The big brass should figure out
how to get us out.
You may be right,
but by now they're all prisoners
or have flown the coop to Japan.
But even Japan must be -
So the Americans take Japan
and the Russians take Manchuria?
The Soviets wouldn't do that.
They'll return it to the Chinese.
To Chiang Kai-shek?
I don't know,
but to the Chinese, in any case.
The Soviet Union
doesn't need more territory.
Their sole aim has always been
the liberation of China.
So they're happy
to do all the work for nothing?
Tange.
This liberation...
how will it take place?
The Communist Chinese
will take over.
All conditions
for revolution are in place.
That means civil war.
Are you guys Reds?
Why not run to the Russians
with your tails wagging?
We have no tails to wag.
So you're fake commies?
Glad you're not the real thing.
<i>- Who goes there?</i>
<i>- Friends!</i>
- Proceed!
It's stinkin' cold out there!
Like winter!
Were we happy when we saw
these lights from the woods!
Not a bad place
to make a final stand, eh?
Plenty of supplies.
What's the plan?
Hikita, where'd you leave
that girl and her brother?
How far did you get?
We took her to a hill
overlooking her village.
She was a smart one.
She said that was far enough.
Stop lying!
You walked 50 miles
more than we did today?
So what if he's lying?
What's it to you?
If you were so worried,
why didn't you escort them yourself?
You didn't get your chance
because I offered first.
You were trying
to impress her.
She'd already been
worked over by the Reds.
Why should she deserve
special treatment?
And just what treatment
did you give her?
I gave her
the appropriate treatment.
Meaning?
You want to know?
I wiped the Russian filth off her.
Now talk!
What did you bastards
do to her and her brother?
Get out of here!
I'm confiscating your weapons.
Terada, take their rifles.
You bastards can crawl
on all fours from now on.
