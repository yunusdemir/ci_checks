I mean ... he really wanted to play
football today, but then pushed it on.
And when he came to the toilets,
they were locked ... strangely.
So it happened a little accident.
Sure. I totally agree
with you, Miss Chauhan.
When I was in school, I was
team captain in junior netball kind,
so I know the value of
exercise and sport.
I did not say it to
emphasize myself.
I go to work.
There is a Cheese salad in the refrigerator,
and with the beets is to Tony.
I do not need a babysitter.
No, I know what you need.
A bullet!
I heard it!
You may well hear someone squeezing a pimple
in Australia?
If you shoot me
are you in jail.
Do not tempt me.
I'm hearing you on the homework
When I get home, so you know.
Rose!
Bravo, Ste!
Tell her to lower the volume.

Yes, and I try to make chips!
She locked herself in her room.

I give up.
Leah! Leah

Leah, think of all the nice
neighbors who live here
Some do not like Mama Cass!

I guess I should be happy

Leah!
What a fucking racket?
She can not control their children!
I have just got one!
Lucky as hell!
Rose, The volume will go down.
Do you think I enjoy this?
Leah!

You know I'd do anything for you.
Or ... for you.-
I would not touch her with ...
See you!
Thank you, Trevor.
Trevor ! Trevor !
Your mother was talking seriously with me
Problems. I know it.
You go over the pitch, the match is in progress,
and heart rushing.
They are afraid. Jamie.
Afraid for the ball to come,
You know, too close.
We can fight against it together.
Like to dribble?
No, me neither.
But occasionally, so ...
It looks like fried crap.
Trevor, make a sandwich.
- But he ...
- Trevor !
Damn it!
I can not eat all that.
Where did you meet my mom?
On the planet Earth.
Where?
You know how it is;
here and there.
What does a place?
It's somewhere where
things happen.
Yes, but where?
Gateways.
Do you get horny on her?
Sure.
She is 35!
What does age matter?
Age is just ...
digits.
Mom said you were a painter.
I know why she chose you,
she needs repainting.
She does not like the color
from last year.
Such is my mother,
she gets tired quickly.
She might get tired of you.
Then you probably do not laugh, right?
Is that dope?
Give me some.
- You.
- What is it?
Your mom will be fine.
Dry Martini and soda please.
A beer.
Lou? Who serves her?
I do not know.
There is no alcohol in this,
what is it?
You. Get out! You are minors.
I only drink Coca-Cola!
You may drink blood when
I give you a slap stick.
What is hard.
Was that a threat?
Yes, and here comes another one ...
Stick before I call your childminder.
Come Meat cutters. She is tough.
Cutters? What you cut up?
Crepe toilet paper?
He's incontinent!

Louise takes care of you, Mr. Barr?
Naturally ...
Can we talk?

Old enough.
How old are you?
Twenty-seven. Not old enough
to be your dad, right?
What?
Sure ...
What?
Everything is ... a bitch, right?
What?
The whole ... concept.
Anyway, I think you have to
work in order to get away from that.
Right?
Please, Trevor, sorry.
You can do it easily, Princess. on
you do not mess up, the job is yours.
What questions will they ask?
You are looking for a new bartender.
You have three brides who are looking for work.
You say, "If you find five pounds on the floor,
what do you do with it? "
First the bride says, "I would ask
the next evening if somebody has lost it. "
Others bride say,
"I put it in the checkout."
Third bride says
whoever finds it, keep it '
Who do you work for?
The one with the biggest tits!
I would have your own apartment,
be down Stringfellows every night.
I would have serious drug problems.
I would have my own miniature poodle.
and I'd get to me. one can
do anything if you had your own pub
I have not been to the interview yet.
Someday I will

Pastrami on rye bread and fettuccine?
Tony. Just make a sandwich.
You must be skavfötters

I can sign up Ronnie?
Do you hear me?
This is Sandra and I'm not happy!
Fuck you, you fucking snake pussy

What are you reading?
It's my mother's.
Really?
I've seen it in the store.
- Hey!
-Hello!
- What are you reading?
- If Sally from Coronation Street.
The blonde?
Yes. Her name is Sally for real.
- What, for real and on TV?
- Yes, I hate that name.
Have you always glasses when you read?
- I suppose so.
- You do not have them in school.
- It is not pretty.
- You look good.
Really
Yes, I think so.
- How's the sandwich?
- Cheese and salad. Smaskens.
- Good against your pimples.
- That is correct. Good for pimples and stuff.
- You have no pimples.
- Your are disappearing.
Sure.
Do you Sally?
Not particularly.
Do you?
I have not thought about it.
Like neighboring girl?
- Fancy Leah?
- She likes you.
- Get out!
- I'm just saying it.
Jamie
Are you going to sleep?
Yeah, I'm totally exhausted.
I'm going to turn the light off.
Ste?
Are you alright Brother?
Is everything all right?
Yes.
Right.
Ste?
What is it?
Good night.
Good night, Jamie.
The second applicant said,
"I would put it at the checkout."
The third says
"I would keep it for yourself."
Who would you offer the job?
It's obvious, right?
The bride with the largest tits.
Seriously, so lean
I ate the third applicant.
Then I know at least
I have her.
If you have children, wife Gangel?
Yes, a son. Jamie.
He is always so kind.
I did well off me,
or how?
You'll soon notice, princess.
You!
Perverse.
Sorry?
I do not think you understand
seriousness of the word pervert.
Anyone who goes out with a slip
must be a pervert.
Say that again?
Your bride.
Sandra?
She speaks to me
I was an idiot.
You should not use words that  Bride
You should fit you.
Sandra has a bad reputation.
I say nothing.
Anyone got a match?
Yes, take me in the ass.
Your ass is not so neat.
Grow up sometime.
Linda Lusardi!
Come in and dress modestly!
Get me the ball back!
Download it for yourself!
Are you all right today, Ste
Yes.
I went to look at a new school
Today, with only twenty students.
There will be twenty-two with you
and Mama Cass.
- Sleeping students over there?
- No.
What a shame.
I would have helped you pack.
The fat slut and her music,
and everything.
You should not speak ill of the dead!
Nasty how she died.
How did she die?
-Kvävs Of a sandwich!
Now you know why you do not
may evict you in the chips.
- Was not she nedknarkad?
- Was she?
If you are so bold,
gives well dope happiness.
Maybe she was happy
to be thick!
If she was there, Jamie,
why she suffocated when a sandwich? Huh?
Why was it not a very
large roasting or something?
Maybe it was a sandwich
with bacon and eggs.
No, I'll be on it.
It was steak or chicken,
something with a low cholesterol content.
- Look at her, she knows everything.
- Yes, but ...
When you pass the quiz on TV
can you come back to me.
- I'm more a Mastermind man.
- You lie!
Did anyone saw the quiz
last week?
I do not either.
Tony, open another one for me.
I like when something wet
slides down the throat. What do you say?
I say the same.
Better inside than outside,
If you understand what I mean?
- Shut up!
- Behave!
- My mother taught me never.
- He will be my death, that he becomes.
It is the intention.
Not saying you well so
to your dad, huh, Ste?
I say nothing.
It was not the offense, Ste.
You know what I mean?
- Mom!
- I have to go into.
- If you do that, Ste.
- I've been boxing with my father since.
Huh? You'll never get enough of it, Ste?
No. We will look at boxing.
It was not so funny when your man
beat you up, right?
Oh, you are so clever,
or how?
But remember, the brain had
you of me, so use it.
I always thought
you had been lobotomized.
What did he say?
Explain it to her, Tony!
- You became well lobotomised?
Yeah, I know what it means, Tony!
I work my ass off
and you are just rude.
If it was my pub
did you not go into.
Go ahead. Kick me out.
But you do not dare!
Look at you.
Completely beyond reproach.
But that's okay, Jamie.
I know what you're up to.
You know what?
I know what you're doing, Sandra.
So why not try to be
a better mom for me?
Do not come with it.
I'm a terrible mother
groping in the dark.
I never had anybody so mum
what do I know about kids?
I'm not surprised
she abandoned you!
Your puny little bastard.
I am like my dad?
No, you are like me.
In what way am I weird?
Knock it off, Jamie.
You said it.
You are normal. Right?
So you got me as a mother,
but who said life was easy?
It's you.
You are normal.
Want to join in boxing?
Shut up.
- I have an extra ticket.
- Leave me alone.
- Are you okay?
- It looks good that way.
They think I'm an asshole.
Jamie
Do you want to watch the Sound of Music
- It goes on satellite, Jamie
- We are going to sleep!
Okay.
Sorry, guys.
It's my mother's.
Body Shop.
Peppermint fotlotion.
Easy on the feet.
Lie down and I'll anoint
you in on the back. If you want to ...
Cool, right?
Yes.
I'll be working at the sports center.
Should you
Both the fitness pool
and the leisure pool.
I know I can do it.
You are a good swimmer.
It's so lonely when you are swimming.
It will stink mint on me
-Pepparmint.
-Pepparmint.
Have you ever kissed someone ...?
And stuck my tongue?
When you look like this?
You are not ugly
They have made me ugly.
I do not think you're ugly.
Turn around, so I lubricate the front.
I can not.
-I'm so sore. I would wail
me and then your mom set.
Jamie? Excuse.
Who played the Baroness
- Eleanor Parker.
- Right
I want to shine before Tony.
Sorry, it will not happen again.
- Switch off the lights.
- No.
- Please.
- I do not.
Can I lie in the same direction as you?
- No.
- Please.
You stay where you are.
- Are you happy now?
- Well, good night.
You think I'm gay?
It does not matter what I think.
May I touch you?
I'm a little sore.
Yes.
- Nice kid!
- Fuck you, I will help my cousin!
Motherhood suits you!
Yes, if I got pregnant, I would
not get rid of it ...
as some slinkor I know.
Yes, you're nowhere with black holes,
not me.
- Where are you?
- Out with my friends.
Jamie, you have no friends.
- I'm going to a party but do not get late.
- I know.
I have knocked on a few times.
I thought you'd come in again.
It's hot. A fucking heat wave, Jamie,
You think I want to be indoors then?
No, it's just ...
just a little strange.
I was out?
What's strange about that?
- I was worried about you.
- Do not be.
- But it was me.
- Do not be
Nothing has happened, right?
I'm okay. I'm normal.
All, all is normal.
- You're bruised.
- Ignore it, Jamie.
Will it be better then? has Dad
put away your fists?
- Or do you not burned at the food?
- I said stop!
- You're scared.
- I'm not afraid of anything.
- it does not
- No!
Last week I was in Woolwich.
When I came out of a store low
a packed guy in the gutter,
and everyone just walked past him.
I had to step over him.
And it was my dad.
It got me thinking about the bus.
Why be afraid of such a splinter ...?
He dresses're always up to you.
He is embarrassing.
Nothing more or less.
- Why be afraid of it?
- Are you afraid of that car called gay?
Are you?
Perhaps.
Maybe not.
- Are you there?
- Gay?
Gay?
I'm very happy.
I'm happy when I'm with you.
Now, it said.
Tan only.
No.
Why not?
Do not you think that's funny?
I do not want.
I think it's funny.
Why are not you laughing then?
Want to get into tonight?
- Say something.
- I can not.
Say no then.
We take a drink, huh?
Scrub my back, Tony.
Tony?
Tony, what is it?
Tony?
It's just ... something that Leah said.
Leah?
I'll look away
while you continue talking.
- Then turn to me with the pliers.
- What?
- It's an experiment.
- It is strange.
I do not understand,
do you want me to hit hard?
Yes. Here Ste, it makes you,
You are stronger than she.
- No!
- I can not fucking do it!
Come on. Speaking on.
- I did talk!
- Is anyone else who is high?
Read this!
It is underlined.
Mama Cass did not participate, Phillip
did not like her voice enough.
But one day, Cass
a lead pipe in the skull
- When she recovered from the concussion ...
- Say it ...
Lo and behold,
her voice was altered.
Lo and behold,
her voice was altered.
You fucking slut.
- How dare you say something like that to my guy?
- La-ah!
I lost the baby,
your toxic small cow!
You should never turn against me, Tony,
Leah, do you hear me?
For he sees you just as a
little slut who settles in.
- I wanted to change that.
- Yes, some things never change.
I wanted to change that!
A leopard spots retain forever
and a whore same kind of panties.
- Remember that.
- Damn, I'm high.
We go, Tony.
- Do you crave a drink, darling?
- Go to hell!
Is it your mom, Gangel?
No wonder you're crazy!
You would not have said anything
Tony.
- Add the.
- Should I call an ambulance?
Call a vet for euthanasia.
Hi Ste!
Do you have any ecstasy pills left?
- No
- Please, Steven!
- No way
- Come on Jay, we go.
Give us a tablet, otherwise disseminates
I like who you slept with last week.
What?
- What are you talking about.
- He slept on the couch.
Not what I heard. gayfuckers,
said your mother. Cosy.
Do not worry about her, Ste.
- What would your father say?
- Fuck you, Leah!
- What would ... say Trevor?
- Leah!
- Try!
- I do not like to hit girls!
- Turn me then. Do it. Hit me.
- Your stupid fagot!
- Ste came.
You! Trevor already know!
You know how the apartments are,
the walls are paper thin!
Why do you think he still
is on you, huh? He knows!
There is nothing to know!
- Gayfuckers?
- You do not know a damn thing!
- Really?
- Yes, really.
But this much I know, I have
taken you in defense. Both of you.
Said I knew you slept
on the couch, I watched it.
I said, "You should not say so
if your own brother, they're just friends. "
Nothing happened.
- When Trevor finally hit you?
- You have not to do?
- I bet it was Thursday.
- And?
That's when I told him.
That was when I lied.
- Give her a tablet.
- Nah, that's not right.
I'm not looking for pity.
- Shall we go then?
- Are you stupid, or ?!
- Ste ...
- Paws on Me!
- Ste!
- Get your fucking bögtassar!
It says Ste
- Is all well?
- Yes.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing in particular.
Claire's mother has vodka
at home, right, Claire?
- Yes, a half bottle.
- We're going there now.
Claire's mother works all night.
right, Claire?
Yes. Her name is Mary.
Would you like vodka, Ste?
No.
- All right. See you.
- See you.
Come on, Claire.
I guess a lie
is out of the question then ?!
- I'm going now.
- Okay.
You!
- What is his problem?
- He's in love.
No!
- Well, we'll see!
- See you! I would not want to be you!
Do you desire to go to Greenwich? The park!
Standing astride the meridian, as they say.
I need to sort out
week's roster.
You depend on the pub,
addicts!
Do not complain about it, there are
money to booze.
Is that all you want out of life?
I want to earn enough money
to buy waterproof shoes.
- I can give you the shoes.
- No, Tony.
- I can make shoes for you.
- Tony
When vacuuming I
or do something else.
- But you wanted to go to the park!
- It does not matter.
- You, Ste!
- Is everything okay with you?
You, Ste,
Do you have something you want to tell?
A little bird sang to me
you're in love.
What?
Three letters, the word love!
Do not look so anxious,
Jamie said it.
She is jealous,
for it is not she.
What is she?
What's her name?
- No!
- An abbreviation for Nolene? What cute.
It was about time, you deserve it;
for you are good.
Here, buy a gift Nolene
for this.
- Buy some flowers.
- Sandra, I can not take your money.
I got lots of drinking last night.
Take it.
It was to his bride.
Must you use such words?
It does not suit you.
Was Nolene busy tonight?
I bought this for you.
Wow, what a nice hat. It is the
best looking hat I've seen, Mr. Steven.
Does that mean we're engaged?
What is it?
Tony.
You have to help me.
It does not feel right. Not here.
Your mother and Tony's in there.
And my dad and Trevor over there ...
I have an aunt in Gravesend,
we could go there, because she is deaf.
But it does not feel right either.
You can not transmit HIV virus
by frottage.
- What is frotage?
- It's a French word.
Dear Brian,
I'm twenty-three, black and gay.
I'm happy, but afraid of what
people say about me behind my back,
and not accept me as I am.
In addition, my family knows nothing.
Unhappy, in north London.
Come across the river, so
I'll make you happy!
Turn to page ninety-two.
At the bottom right.
There is a pub.
Bus 180 goes there.
And?
Look at this.
Is not it beautiful?
You would never get the
through the front door.
Maybe move it someday?
Clean artwork.
Claude Monet could not
have done it better.
Get out.
Do you know who Claude Monet is?
Jamie, I'm not stupid.
You remember that I won a year's supply
freshener for that poem.
It requires reflection
and artistic talent.
Imagine that?
You and I, with her feet tucked up,
a cold winter?
- In the.
-  Sandra
Who was he?
He painted the Sistine Chapel.
- And I'm not done with you yet.

my little klantige son?
cocksucker
Bum Fucker
Have you seen Jamie!
I love you. You are wonderful.
Petra, I hope the leg gets better.
She still believes
she is featured in Baby Jane.
Want to pull me backstage, buddy?
Excuse me, what's going on here?
Dear Petra?
- A bit too young for you, right?
He has just left the diapers.
Shut up.
What is your name?
- Jamie.
- It's great.
I get the urge to show
my breasts for you.
I feel like
a chicken tonight!
So, Jamie,
I think I want two of you,
and ten of your friends!
I'll stop now.
See you after the break.
Oh, you do not want to
leg was better, Petra.
See you later!
Mother Love, here I come!
- Are you okay, Leah?
- Leah? Who is Leah?
Did you have a good time tonight?
Yes.
- Were you at the cinema?
- Yes.
- With Ste?
- Yes.
Do not lie, Jamie!
I'm not lying!
You did well to Gloucester,
or how?
Look at me
I just had a drink.
That's where homosexuals go.
It is not just gay,
it makes others too.
People like you?
Yes.
-Miss Chauhan called today.
That old hag?
- You never said to you in the ass!
- It may be all!
Oh ...
Will everyone called fagot too?
- You are full.
- No, I am not.
You got drunk on a fucking gay bar.
- How do you know that it's a gay bar?
- There is a large pink neon ass outside.
Have you been spying on me?
No one at work saw you enter.
It does not mean I'm gay.
They should take care of her.
- That's what I said.
- Right.
For me, I can put together
two and two to four.
- I'm not that fucking stupid.
- I went to take a drink.
- All of my class does.
- Yes.
But they do not go to
Gloucester, right?
- Some take drugs, they do not.
- No, I really hope so!
Thanks for that.
Go to sleep.
- I can not sleep, Jamie.
- Do not blame it on me.
- Can not you talk to me, Jamie?
- I'm completely exhausted.
Jamie. Please.
Talk to me.
About what?
I am your mother.
Some things are so difficult to say.
I know. I know that.
You think I'm too young.
You think it's just a thing.
You think I'll get AIDS
and ... and everything.
You know everything about me, huh?
Do not cry.
There you go ...
I'm not going to ask you out
tomorrow, as an empty bottle.
I thought that it was embarrassing
force you to share a bed with Ste.
And you did well all the time with ...
seventy minus one.
I like the guy, Jamie.
But he has not seen anything of life.
- He is kind to me.
- Is he?
Yes.
- What have you done now?
- Nothing.
Why is she so upset?
Because I'm gay! Hobo! Sissy! Homo!
Because I'm gay! Hobo! Sissy!
Homo! Rövknullare!
I ... I get it.
Leave me alone.
- Did she do it?
- No, I wanted to tell you first.
It's ... it's ...
It's easy.
Good night, son.
He was ...
He was the most beautiful baby
Bermondsey.
I used to shoot around him,
in a fine hat;
in a large blue stroller called
"Road Queen".
Nothing has changed.
- But you're fighting against.
- Struggling?
I have fought all my life.
The kids picked on him.
I was there.
The kids teased him.
I was there.
When I was broke, and the refrigerator empty,
I stole for him.
So do not talk to me
about fighting.
You? What have you needed
fight for your life?
Thank you.
Thanks to all members of the academy.
This award means so much to me.
I have never won anything
previously.
I want to thank my manager and my band.
But most of all ...
- Do I want to thank a very special person.
- What ...
The woman, from which all energy flows.
the price is as much hers as mine.
The woman who gives me so much ...
inspiration.
- A round of applause for her ... Mama San!
- Leah.
- People tell me ...
- Leah, are you drunk?
- Where do you get your energy from?
- Leah ... is two o'clock at night.
- And I say hey ...
- Has she made something?
- Mama San.
- Is your mother home?
Mama San, go for it, honey.
I feel your vibes.
- Is she working tonight?
- Never let the light forsake you, Mom San.
Rose! Leah, presented with the keys.
Hurry up.
Have you taken drugs?
- Jamie! Leah, give me your keys.
- Do not yell at her.
- You give me bad vibes, Mom.
- She's taken something.
Jamie!
- You are old, I do not like old people.
- It's cool, it's no problem.
Well, it really is, Tony,
do not pet her
- What is happening?
- Rose?
I saw a movie about
Woodstock once.
Leah, go in and
turn the music down!
- Oh my God! Tony!
- Leah, what ...
- Damn it, Leah!
- Tony, take her down! Tony
Leah. Leah, what have you taken
Drug
- Come on down, you stupid cow.
- Sandra!
Body language, Tony!
- You! Stop It Now!
- Go to hell! Subba!
- Behave yourself, you old whore!
- Jamie, help us!
- Betty, this is the back!
- I can see it.
Right?
- How can you sleep like that noise?
- It's okay, you'll be fine.
- It will be nice to move from here.
- What?
I've gotten a job
if you want to know.
As the owner of a pub in Rotherhithe.
With a nice little apartment above.
Thank you for telling it.
You keep quiet.
- Leah?
- Let the silly cow to be.
We can not just ...
Tony! Tony!
In with you, Jamie.
Ste, she knows.
- My mom knows.
- Why do you say that?
- I never said it!
- How can she know?
Because she is not
dumb as a rake.
Jamie, giving him a handkerchief.
There is a box at my bed.
Leah!
Mama Cass!
I do not believe in secrets.
I think that people should
be forthright and honest.
But I'm not stupid.
Do you think I want to see infant suicide?
So, do not tell your dad.
He would kill me.
- Yes, you said it.
- He would!
Yes, we already know, Ste!
- It would all do!
- I'll kill you if you do not stop tuning!
you are a nice guy.
And that's what counts.
And ... somewhere ...
- Do people who do not want to kill you.
- No, I do not.
- You have found Gloucester.
- I hate it.
- Someone else then, shut up.
- There is no one else.
There are actually, Ste.
There is an island in the Mediterranean Sea
called Lesbos,
and all who live there are palms.
So now disappeared some tears.
Dry them thoroughly.
- Fuck me.
- No, nothing like that here.
I go to bed.
Five minutes.
Sure, Sandra. Good night, Sandra.
PLEASANT, Sandra.
Yes, that is my name, Ste,
Wear not out there.
 I wish I was the one who moved.
It never happens something here.
 I get up in the morning,
put on half a ton of makeup,
Fixes to the hair spray.
And that is all.
It's the same show every day.
There's fucking nothing
to look forward to.
- What is your new school?
- I did not enter.
- You want to come to Gloucester?
- Do what?
Gaypub.
- I do not know any gay people.
- Yes, you do.
- Do I?
- Yes.
 - There are good men.
- Oh.
Dancing backwards
and never married.
I told it to you.
Are you going to Woolwich, huh?
What?
Yeah.
- First round restaurant and late night club.
- You are challenging dressed like that.
Why do you hang out with do not
us to Gloucester?
- Call and say that you hit them later.
- Jamie!
You do not know how to have fun,
huh?
There is a male stripper as well.
 - Louise.
- Yes?
I never get any grandchildren.
Oh.
- You did not leave any job in your new pub?
- No.
But if I open a brothel,
I hear of me.
Yes have to go in and get ready.
I'm going out with Ste and Jamie tonight.
-To Gloucester?
Yeah. I was going to find a nice flat.
For I must tell you,
I have had enough of men.
 - If I had a camera now.
- What?
- Then I would take a picture.
- Tony. What are you doing?
- I can not keep me away from you.
- I told you I'd go out.
- Thought I could keep up.
- It's girls' night out, you just get bored.
- I want to celebrate too.
- Yes, but I told you ...
They do not like it?
I do not like it.
How about a little kiss, then I go.
Something to think about until tomorrow.
Stop it now.
I'll call you.
- Tony.
- When are you free next evening?
No.
No Tony.
I think it's best you go.
Here, you can throw it
in the chute?
-- What should you do?
- Stay home.
- See you later.
- Yes.
You will be seduced
by some lesbian, Leah.
Why do not you come with me
on bingo instead?
But you see, Mom?
I'm a lesbian!
Oh no!
- Is there anybody there?
- No.
Dance with me.
Leah.
Can I take a puff.
Come on.
- Ste!
- What is it?
Imagine your father's mine!
- Leah.
- What is it?
- How to be a flat look?
- Big and tough.
- Which eye color?
- Green.
- Long?
- I must raise our sights.
- What nice.
- Yes.
Yes.
