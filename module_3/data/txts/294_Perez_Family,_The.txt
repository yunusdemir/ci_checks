Rápido!
Kill me.
Fire, you son of a bitch!

<i>Fidel Castro is emptying his jails
of political prisoners,</i>
<i>and allow them to flee Cuba.</i>
<i>President Carter has granted asylum</i>
<i>to all the 110.000 Cuban refugees</i>
<i>that have reached American shores.</i>
<i>The last boats departing from Mariel harbor near Havana</i>
<i>are heading towards Key West in a steady flux.</i>
He isn't coming tonight, mamá.
Teresa.
You remember 20 years ago?
I was three.
<i>US immigration officials say the refugees</i>
<i>represent a wide cross section of Cuban society.</i>
<i>At a Labor Day rally, Fidel Castro urged</i>
<i>one million of his supporters to denounce
the Marielitos leaders...</i>
I wonder what side of the bed he'll sleep on.
I'm waiting two months.
When I can go on the boat?
Bonita...
you don't want to go.
You have a good job cutting sugar cane.
You are a whore, no?
You like it, huh?
I am like Cuba,
used by many, conquered by no one.
A man like you change uniform with each regime...
Batista, Fidel.
But I am siempre La Isla.
What do you want in America
that I can't give you here?
I love Elvis Presley.
And good rock 'n' roll.
I want to fuck
John Wayne.
Oye.
When we get to Miami
I will have a gold coffer
with little shells on top.
We go to United States.
Marielita soy, soy.
Guárdame El bolso.
I'm dreaming.
Florida. Florida.
I thought we were back in Mariel.
No, señor, look.
Key West.
Will my wife be here to meet me?
How nice, you have a wife.
That's good.
I didn't know I'd be so old, señora.
My teeth are too poor to kiss my wife.
No worry, you can kiss your wife.
Guard my things, señor.
No! No!

Scum.
One bag, please.
Hey! Hey! One bag!
Name?
Juan Raúl Pérez.
Political prisoner. Your charge?
I set my sugar cane fields on fire,
instead of giving them to him, to Fidel.
Marital status? Married?
Sí.
Your name?
Ponga Dottie.
Dorita Evita Pérez.
I don't like Dorita.
I hate Evita. Little Dora, little Eva.
You see, it's not a matter of like or dislike.
I'm a new woman here.
You came here for political asylum.
You can change your name some other time, okay?
I don't want political asylum.
I came here to get away from political asylum.
I don't want no government.
Do you have any other relatives here?
I mean, other than your wife?
Yes.
Pérez.
If you want something done in this life, ask a Pérez.
There are so many of us.
My mother was a Pérez.
They didn't ask me anything about Carmela.
They didn’t ask me nothing.
América!
You're very lucky that you're married.
Sponsors here don't want single people,
especially single ladies.
Sponsors?
We're getting a criminal element from your Cuba.
Prostitutes, riffraff,
Izzy dizzy.
No, they're undesired.
For the sponsors
large families at the top of the list.
Single people
stock in camps, waiting,
waiting,
simply waiting.
Ay, Dios mío.
Is it over? They're close to leave?
Yeah. Thank god.
This morning anyone named Pérez?
Everyone named Pérez.
I'm looking for Juan Pérez.
Try 110.000 Marielitos in two month, my friend,
half of them named Juan Pérez.
Only one today... Juan Pérez.
Excuse me?
And his wife, Dorita Pérez.
Wife? No, no, no. I'm looking for...
I give you 20 dollars for stop making that noise!
It's free.
I'm looking for the Juan Pérez
that's married to my sister Carmela in Miami.
You're positive this Juan Pérez has a wife?
Miami!
Que puta.
I hired six boats to go to Mariel.
You know how much it costs me?
And for what? Human garbage!
You're working for Fidel, my friend.
Come mierda!
Are you French?
No.
Carmela, the radio.
I heard they closed the boat lift. Did he come?
He's coming today, I feel it.
You know how you get those feelings?
I hope this is working
Ángel went to Key West.
He's supposed to call me when he's back with Juan Raúl.
It's okay. I'm just so excited.
Ángel.
<i>Carmela.</i>
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>
<i>The last boat arrived</i>
<i>and Juan Raúl did not come.</i>
<i>Carmela?</i>
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I kept sending them bribes</i>
<i>to get him out of jail.</i>
<i>Don't cry, Carmelina.</i>
<i>I'll take care of you.</i>
Ángel, no.
No.
Juan.
Do you really have a wife in Miami?
When was the last time you hear from her?
Two years ago.
I have a letter.
Nothing in two years?
No money, no nothing?
Your wife could be dead, señor.
She could be in a terrible accident
or married to somebody else.
She could be the wife of a rich man.
She could be living in Venezuela.
Are you sure your wife is waiting for you?
Because I have a solution.
Oye.
If your wife does not come
you and I can pretend to be married.
Pérez y Pérez.
Just for the rich sponsor.
When we're free, I help you to find your wife.
I don't need your help, señora.
Carmela will come for me.
Good! Then you can take me into your house
to pay me for my kindness,
until I find a job.
Don't worry, I take very good care of you.
I explain your wife I have no interest in you.
It is strictly survival.
Hollywood.
That's where John Wayne live.
Only 65 miles to John Wayne.
Oh, I go there tomorrow.
<i>Welcome to the Orange Bowl Football Stadium.</i>
<i>You're permitted to leave the premises</i>
<i>between 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m.</i>
<i>After 9:00 p.m. is curfew. But remember,</i>
<i>when you're out, you are on your own.</i>
<i>If you do not return you will be deemed illegal.</i>
<i>So, be careful.</i>
<i>Obey the rules of the United States Immigration Service.</i>
<i>Welcome to freedom.</i>
Oh, my god, they're going to shoot us!
<i>These men are not los policía,</i>
solamente seguridade.
<i>They're not going to fire.</i>
Señora, stay behind me!
Juan, you're not in Cuba!
The police will not touch you.
Stop this!
If Americans will think you're crazy,
I have to get another husband.
They really ought to debrief these people.
Señora, don't leave me.
I won't leave you.
Ángel has completely lost his paranoid little mind.
Show some respect to your uncle.
He's just trying to protect us with this crime wave.
This is the crime wave,
buy a gun with no serial numbers,
and then give it to his own sister without a permit.
Mamá.
Why don't you take the medicine?
The doctor says that you will feel a lot stronger.
He's right. I feel a lot stronger.
Put the coffee back on, Teresa, por favor.
Hola, Ángel.
Didn't you lock the door?
How many times have I told you
about the Mariel criminals?!
Castro flush his toilets on us!
He forgot to flush one, Ángel.
He forgot to send my husband.
Carmelina, as if I didn't try everything!
I send them bribes!
"As if I hadn't done everything!"
"I spend every goddamn dime. And for what?"
"She doesn't even thank me."
When was the last time
you even get a letter from him?
What do you expect, a Hallmark Card?
Go to the car. I'll take you to the hospital.
Shut up! I'm your uncle!
Carmela, where's the gun I gave you?
You have to keep it where you can use it.
I threw it in the garbage.
- Are you crazy?!
- Stop it, Ángel!
What do you think you're doing?!
My mother does not need a gun!
You don't have a man along to protect you.
What happens when a Marielito comes through that door?
Oh, shit. Were we that loud?
Hide the gun. I take care of this.
No.
In there.
Hi, we got a complaint.
Just wanna make sure everything's okay.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I realized too late the TV was too loud.
Very loud. Looks like it bust a hole
in your wall over there.
We're having some work gone.
It's been that way for weeks.
Do you mind if we come in and look around just a little bit?
It'll just take a minute.
Carmela Pérez?
Yes, and this is my daughter Teresa Pérez.
She studies art history at FIU.
Why do you have a beeper, Miss Pérez?
We're waiting for my husband on the boat lift.
My brother gave it to me in case I wasn't near a phone.
That is actually the truth,
and yes, I know, the boat lift is over.
July '80. This prescription was filled today.
Where are the Valium?
I put them down the sink.
Surely did.
If I'm in pain, I wanna know it.
It's my philosophy exactly.
Forgive me, Miss Pérez, but I don't wanna leave you
if you're in some kind of situation with a man.
A man?
There is no man here.
There is no man here?
No.
Okay.
My name is John Pirelli.
I'm a federal agent.
Officer Rhoades here is the cop.
I’m just doing some research with the local force.
If you're in any kind of trouble
I want you to give one of us a call, okay?
Yes, of course.
But there is no trouble.
Okay. Sorry I bothered you.
You're a really good liar!
Wow!
Maybe the most beautiful liar I ever met.
Tití! What happened to you?
Tití!
Why you're always wet, Flavia?
You're always in the shower.
You could've come in. I was lonely.
Ah, god, them painkillers are worthless.
Oh, baby. Baby.
Oh, guess what?!
I've been asked to sing at the Varadero Festival.
Yes! They asked me, Flavia, at the Varadero Festival.
Why is it always so messy here?
We can go to your place sometime.
You know how much money I spend on that condo?
I don’t wanna get it dirty.
That's why I take the showers.
You don't like things dirty.
You like things a little dirty,
papi.
- Testing, one, two...
- Stop it, please!
I've failed Carmela.
The only thing my sister has ever asked me for.
You know, Ángel,
you used to be so much fun, until you got obsessed.
Okay. Go. Go away!
Go to your clean condo!
I wish your brother-in-law had come,
and this whole thing would be over.
It is over, Tití.
He didn't come
and is never going to.
I'm sorry.
Juan Raúl Pérez no longer exists.
<i>Teresa, my daughter.</i>
<i>Teresa, mi Linda.</i>
I feel like I'm floating.
20 years ago,
I lay alone in my bed each night.
In the morning,
my pillow would be wet with tears.
Each day
I put you in the most beautiful embroidered dresses,
just in case that was the day he would come.
The waiting is familiar now.
It's become a friend.
It's like breathing.
It's part of my life.
He's never coming.
I should be happy.
I wanted papi to come, too, mamá.
When I was little, I wanted him more than anything.
But also, it's just good to know finally
that he isn't coming.
I was not a prostitute.
If that's what you mean, your paper are a lie.
It is saying,
"agricultural worker."
230 is your number.
Do we get the sponsor today?
230 is your number!
For the sponsor,
a large family is number one.
Any children?
No.
No children.
- Any in-laws?
- No.
No in-laws.
I'm going to have to tell you what to do.
Get a job,
'cause if you get a job, you'll get a sponsor.
You are liking movies?
Tonight,
Cowboys and Indians.
Hey, not my kind of Indian.
Oh, John Wayne!
You know, I'm going to meet him. He live very near.
John Wayne is dead.
No, your wrong.
You think in Elvis Presley.
Elvis is dead, yes, but not John Wayne.
No.
Big Joe, it's me.
Isn't your John Wayne dead?
Not John Wayne.
John Wayne is dead.
He's dead.
John Wayne is dead.
At first I thought...
Well, I knew Elvis was dead.
Elvis Presley is dead?
So many assassinations.
They told me I have to find a job,
and there are only two things I know how to do.
One is cut sugar cane,
and I cannot see any sugar cane on this football...
The other thing,
I was saving it for John Wayne.
This isn't libertad, it's prison!
When I will be free?
Juan, you really have a wife?
Carmela.
Carmela is my wife.
Why did she not come for you?
Señora, she doesn't know I'm here.
I didn't tell her I was coming.
I said I'd go away for the weekend, and
it turned into 20 years.
Okay. We are going to immigration,
and we're asking them to find her.
Corre, señor.
This is our only chance.
And don't forget to tell them maybe she don't live here anymore.
And don't tell them she's your wife.
- Say, she's your sister or your cousin.
- And I don't forget to tell them that I hate communism.
Don't raise it up like that.
It looks nice.
I look as one of my workers in the sugar cane fields.
And what is wrong with that?
My teeth.
I cannot come to Carmela like this.
Juan, you're very handsome.
You don't know what I was.
Juan, believe me, if your wife loves you, she won't mind.
But don't hope too much.
Probably we don't even find her.
Lip gloss, Rolex watches, aquí.
Woo, mamá.
Come over here.
I like the way you walk.
Ey, Pérez, it's my customer.
You Pérez?
Me, too.
Dottie Pérez.
Felipe. Glad to know you.
You're from Mariel?
- Yeah!
- Oye, mijo.
My husband and I could use another Pérez.
The bigger the family, the quicker get the job.
Thanks, mom, but I did this purse, see,
I'll be famous in about a month.
Besides, I'm a lone wolf.
The wolf
I'm better alone.
You're smart to have your business, mijo.
How much for the nail polish?
50 cents,
and no family discounts, mamá.
Did I ask you for a discount?
Hey, Pérez, where is my money?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Tomorrow, tomorrow.
What's a day? He or she?
No cash, no deal, huh?
- Hey!
- Ah, come on.
That's some coconut, eh?
Save me, San Ignacio.
Lip gloss, nail polish, right here.
Hey, baby, I missed you.
Felipe, my pal.
Where you been, Mr. Invisible?
Hey, Orlando, I've been trying to find you.
I'm getting the money together.
You know, man, I've been trying.
Really trying.
I tell you what, you little fuck and faggot...
I'm gonna give you 24 hours.
Oh, no. See, it's that...
I need more time. Please, man.
You're out of time. Mañana.
Shit!
Oh, come on, man,
don't kill me.
Yay, Pepito. Yay, Pepito.
Yay, Pepito.
Pepito.
Here is your money.
Ah, gracias.
- My wife has come?
- Now, just follow me.
I didn't know she would be here.
I was standing waiting in line.
I didn't know.
Look at this shirt.
Yay, Pepito.
Pérez, presenting your wife.
See my hips. Money.
This woman is not my wife. Where is my wife?
Shut up. You're crazy?
This woman is not my wife!
Oye, loco.
Do you want me to find another husband?
He's always looking down to me.
Before the revolution he was married to a princesa.
Carmelina.
Carmela.
This is the best security system money can buy.
You'll be completely save now.
I am save, Ángel.
No, no, no. Carmelina, no.
No one is save.
I think of you here, in this house alone.
This is not a good world.
I shouldn't have bought the condo.
No, no. Ángel, don't give up the condo.
You need your independence.
I would never forgive myself
if something happened to you.
You're the only family I have.
You're everything to me.
Mr. Díaz.
Mr. Díaz!
How many times have I told you
to put the grids on the window?!
Put these grids on every window!
Now I'm in prison.
I dreamed I was in prison.
I lost all my teeth.
You dream of your manhood.
You fear you've lost your virility.
I've not made love to my wife for years and years.
Abuelita, tell me,
do you think she's gone with another man?
Years and years is a long time.
Azucar. This polish is some kind of sexy.
Tomorrow, abuelita, sexy American movie.
¡Ave Maria purisima!
Oh, Santos.
If you were alive,
I would be inside you right now.
Sabroso.
Qué Rico.
Oh, no!
Dios mio.
It's a miracle.
Oh, god, I'm still on duty.
I gotta go.
Let's go to your house.
Oh, god.
The curfew.
I'm... Still, I can't let you out the premises.
Oh, my hero.
My United States freedom hero.
If you want me,
I deserve a real bed.
Okay, I tell you what...
Friday I'll get you out of here.
I'll take you on a real date.
To a disco?
Okay, disco, everything.
I gotta go.
Gate 14.
Mañana.
I remember, in Colima, in October...
thousand butterflies.
Breezes were sweet.
It was never as hot as this.
- Next year...
- Next year...
- in Habana.
- in Habana.
I just come from Cuba, señor.
Believe me, it's hot.
Look around you, my friend,
Cuba is here.
Señor, where is Coral Gables?
I'll get some herbs from the yard.
What happened, mamá?
He looked like the beggars in Malecón,
where I was a girl.
It's so sad, familiar.
He was casing the house, mamá.
He looked familiar?
There's just something about him,
that reminded me of Havana.
Are you sure it wasn't your husband, Mrs. Pérez?
Oh, no. Not him.
Juan was size 9. These are size 11.
My mother is trying very hard.
to put the memory of my father behind her.
Yeah. The poor guy was probably looking for some yard work.
The world is a pretty save place, all things considered.
I hate to see you sitting inside all day
with your doors locked.
You have to get out a little more.
You should live a little.
Maybe I will.
Oh, would you two like some lemonade?
Another day.
Mom, you don't offer cops lemonade.
Silencio, por favor.
It is August,
and Miami's football teams have begun their practicing,
which means that you have to get out tomorrow.
Families of three or more, you'll stay here.
We are finding a sponsor.
The rest of you will go on I-95 to the tent city
or you'll be transferred to military bases.
I did not come here to live in a tent on a highway!
This I can do in Cuba!
I...
Mr. Pérez on the football post.
Yes, you!
Get down.
Juanito, let's take him to the shower right now!
General Armando Pérez,
from now on your father.
This man is not my father.
If he says so, he's lying.
You don't say nothing!
You don't talk, which is good for the sponsor.
Husband, wife, grandfather, that's a family.
Not my family.
Vaya, Juanito, wash him.
I don't even know him!
I can't go in the man's shower,
he can't go in the woman shower.
You wash him. He's your papi!
Dorita, I'm leaving.
What do you want from me?
All day and I'm going doing laundry,
finding relatives,
anything, so they don't take us to the military base,
and you think you're too good to get your hands dirty.
All I'm asking you to do,
is clean him up, a little, a little.
A little! A Li... Do it!
When we have a sponsor and you are free,
I don't care what you do.
Señora, you're not kind.
Maybe not,
but I'm not lying, I'm honest.
Ay, this loca, she thinks she owns me.
Be a man.
You can be her husband now.
I'm going to find my wife.
Oye! Oye!
Oye!
Don't forget about our date.
Well, let me guess, please, please, please.
Your husband's father.
After 20 years.
You must be very happy.
Now the sponsor's coming.
With only three members in your family
you are number 27.
But who knows?
Maybe your grandmother
will make a sudden appearance, huh?
Maybe.
I want you to get some false teeth for a man
to save his marriage.
Very old, like me.
Value was about 20 dollar gold.
Don't blame me.
Of course, abuelita.
Felipe!
Who is he? Where is his family?
It’s a Pérez. He has no family.
Oh, Felipe, my lost son.
You came back.
Don't die.
Please.
Okay, canine unit are on it's way
to pick up the doberman.
I'm so sorry for your trouble.
My brother Ángel is very protective.
Don't tell me... Older brother?
No.
I brought Angelito with my little girl.
He met Teresa.
My husband stayed behind
to look after the sugar cane.
It's funny, you know...
This is all I could salvage.
Would you like some café cubana?
Hey, we're not in a rush,
are we, officer Rhoades?
Oh, no, sir. I'll call in.
Fresh squeezed.
You do this every morning?
No.
Today was the first day of the rest of my life.
I had to start over myself a few years ago.
Divorce. No kids.
I don't know.
You know, sometimes you start up with this moral impulse.
You want to protect and honor the things you believe in.
The work takes over. 10, 15 years down the line,
it fills the whole horizon.
I mean, you can't see anything else.
I guess family life doesn't mix with my line of work.
Well, maybe you won't always have this line of work.
I was just thinking that.
Do you want me to deactivate this thing?
I mean, you know, it's very sensitive.
Well... No, thank you.
I... It's just couple of wires.
Come on. It'll take five minutes.
Five minutes.
Well, there is something.
You tell your brother there's such thing
as being too secure,
if you know what I mean.
If I were you, I would buy myself a little dog.
They're good company,
and they scare the hell out of the bad guys.
A...
Agent Pirelli.
Who is this boy?
Your son Felipe.
It's a miracle.
I made a sacrifice thanking Babalu Aye.
Dottie told me how he was almost taken from her arms
when he was only a little boy,
when you were still in prison.
Well...
You should be grateful to the Santos.
Sí.
Where is the woman of the house?
Ah, the Yankee security guy.
Who could love such a woman?
She's so ordinary fine.
And she's crazy.
Oh, I'm so happy, Steve Steverino.
Had enough?
Wanna go to my place?
I love the music.
What about another Cuba Libre?
Yes, yes, yes.
I was never so free.
Would you like another one?
Oh, no, thanks, I'm fine.
I don't usually do this,
go out with women I meet on the job.
It's kind of a personal rule of mine.
What the hell, come on, one dance.
No, no.
Just one, come on.
Freedom! What a wonderful day!
Let's go.
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry.
It's okay, I'm so sorry.
But I like the music.
I have a radio.
I'd better go home.
Are you sure?
Yes.
I'm Juan Raúl Pérez.
I'm your father.
My father is dead.
So is mine.
For now,
you are the only son of myself
and my wife Dottie Pérez,
who is not here right now,
or as she said, being unfaithful to me.
Everybody's got a story.
<i>Attend! Clearing this sector!</i>
<i>Line up!</i>
<i>Single men on the bus!</i>
We are waiting here for my wife.
Wait for her on the bus. Go!
- No, I can't. My wife...
- Stud, get up!
This one is my son.
Come on! Hey!
That's my son! Don't touch my son!
Security, some support over here!
- What?
- My hero, wait.
What you're on to?
It's my first date in America,
and I don't want it quick to be finished. Too quick.
Hey...
I took you to a club,
I bought you four drinks, three bucks a pot.
Christ, what more could you ask for?
I might have a beer here somewhere.
Shit, I'll walk on the beer, babe.
Oh, god!
You get what you want,
but don't I get what I want, too?
Right.
I get it..
I'm slow, but I do get it.
Steve Steverino.
I finally get it.
What? Isn't that enough?
It's what you were after, right?
Just tell me when.
Papi.
Where am I?
You're lying on a cot in the Orange Bowl
in the United States,
and we're all here with you.
Your son, and papi, too.
Dottie, you're beautiful.
You always know where you are on this earth.
Welcome to the Church of the Resurrection.
We are your sponsors.
Tomorrow you'll begin your jobs.
Flowers! Flowers!
Two roses.
Gracias. I'm happy.
Say hi to your wife for me, okay?
You look like you're in the mood to spend some money.
Wait for me, Dottie.
I will you get something to eat.
Gracias.
Um, bred?
If we put all our money together,
sometime we can get our own flower shop.
Would you like that, mi vida?
I feel save with you, mamá.
"Mamá"?
You are not sleeping there.
- Take the bed.
- No, no, no.
Don't be ridiculous. Get in the bed.
I forgot everything about beds.
I wonder which side Carmela sleeps on.
<i>Carmela!</i>
Good morning, señor hard-on.
I was dreaming.
Oh, Jesus!
Your father is up on a tree!
I saw you watching!
Miss Pérez, you cannot come out dressed like that.
Tell her, Father.
Go in and get dressed!
Come down, papi.
Good morning, Father. How are you?
Look at his hard-on.
I know, I know, you're happily married.
and you may think you don't need a lot of inspiration,
but let me tell you,
I got this bed for girlfriend,
and ever since, we dance
the Mambo and Merengue every night.
Look, this, my dear lovers, is beauty.
Money can't buy taste.
- Ángel?
- We'll think about this.
No, no, no. I can't have you people hanging out here.
I'm very busy right now. Nice, huh?
You're grown up.
I guess you don't recognize me.
No, I guess I don't,
and now I don't have time to play games right now.
Here.
Buy yourself some food and don't come back here.
It's Juan Raúl,
your brother-in-law.
How did you know my brother-in-law?
I am your brother-in-law.
Come to my office.
Enjoy, huh?
Sit down. I'm gonna need you.
Yes?
Sit down.
What do you want? Money?
I just want the truth, Ángel.
Ah, the truth.
When did you get out?
Few days ago, I think.
Seems like a month. So much has happened.
So, they let you out of El Morro, huh?
I was not in El Morro. I was in Calvario.
You knew that. This is you, isn't it?
You are Ángel Díaz, aren't you?
Coño.
You were in Coral Gables the other day.
So, Carmela does live there.
Is she okay?
And Teresa, is she all right?
My sister moved sometime along.
If you were Juan Pérez, you would know that.
What is it?
Has something happened?
Has Carmela remarried?
Is that why you don't want to tell me?
Am I forgotten?
What gives you the right to come in here
asking questions about my family, huh?
Ángel, just tell me the truth
I... I'm prepared.
The truth is...
you are not my brother-in-law.
Sit tight. I'll be right back.
Call the police. I have a burglar here,
impersonating my brother-in-law.
<i>I'm calling the police right now, Mr. Diaz.</i>
You can't get near Carmela!
You can't get near my sister, or I'll kill you!
Maybe she hates me.
Or she could be married to someone else.
I must know, papi.
Is it possible you called the police,
and then forgot you called?
Why would I do something like that?
Miss Pérez, someone called us.
Maybe you're lonesome.
I don't call police when I feel lonely.
I have my daughter Teresa,
I take classes in Miami Dade,
batik, ceramics, last winter scuba diving...
I love scuba. Are you a scuba diver?
So far only in the deep end of the college.
Come on. You get the Keys out there, you got the Caribbean.
Well, sometimes it's hard for me to do
the things I wanna do.
I get nervous.
So nervous, you keep calling the police.
Rhoades, why don't you go inside
and look for prints or something?
Seems, like, wherever I see you
there is a dog chasing you,
or somebody break into your house.
Look, Carmela,
I... I know it didn't work out the other night,
and I don't wanna push or anything,
but I have to go to D.C.,
just for a little while.
So, I just want you to know that
I'm much better on second dates.
So, maybe you could call me sometime?
Please?
What do you say?
I'll think about it.
Don't make me wait.
You have a headache, Tití?
What happened? You want something?
My hair used to be so dark.
Now it's gray, like an old man.
I like your hair, mi amor.
The silver is very aristocratic.
Mamá, I don't wanna sleep alone.
Can I sleep here with you?
I like it when you call me mamá.
Come here.
On the floor.
Tomorrow we put a mattress.
Thank you, mamá.
Maybe we can buy you some new teeth.
We enough enough.
300 dollar.
You smell like flowers.
He hear us talk, then he took the money
to buy you some false teeth.
Ah, wake up! Good morning!
The boy took the money and ran away.
It's my son. He doesn't steal from me!
In the land of the blind
the one-eyed might be king.
Felipe's gonna come soon,
and then you'll see.
Can't get the car started?
Uh, yeah, wanna help?
Nice car.
You know, I love getting to the beach early.
Am I doing this right?
Beautiful. Perfect.
So, I guess you're not going to the beach, huh?
Let's go.
Enough, Angelito. If I do this,
there will be no more bars on the windows,
no alarms, no police, no police dogs...
Okay.
But, Carmelita, promise me...
promise me you carry this with you at all times.
And if you ever see a Marielito...
Boom.
Promise me?
I promise.
You look beautiful.
Now, just imagine that this is a Marielito criminal.
When I stop the car in front,
you go to the other one, okay?
You can do it. Like this.
Don't you dare walk like that for another man.
Come back here. I'll buy all your flowers myself.
I could never have a husband so
jealous like you.
Flowers!
You tempt me.
You want to take them all? Gracias.
Idiot! The light is... Aaahh!
Coño, ese marielito.
I'm gonna find where this maricón lives.
Coño!
Parasites!
Oye!
Does parasites wear high heels?!
Mañana.
He was only a little boy.
An angel.
I wish he really was our son.
Except he would be dead now.
We must not martyr him, mi amor.
He was from the street,
mixed up with bad people.
Gangsters.
He had no family. He wanted to change.
To be with us.
Sí.
Maybe.
Maybe he was just looking for somewhere to hide.
The truth is so easily lost, Dorita.
If we lie about ourselves,
it opens the door to a world of madness.
Why we come to this terrible country?
We must be strong, mi amor.
Your father!
What you see up there, papi?
Angelito.
That's the one.
You, impostor.
I came here to tell you,
stay away from my sister,
or I'll have you thrown in jail.
You were my jailer in Cuba, Angelito.
20 years you keep me in prison,
torture.
because of you.
In her letters Carmela tells me
of the money you sent.
A river of money.
I never saw it.
I write to her, "Don't send bribes."
But no,
you must play the big man.
20 years.
Oh, we'll keep Juan Raúl in here
because Ángel Díaz in Miami
send so much money!
Coño!
Jesus!
If you want my sister Carmela, why do you keep this whore?
Oh, oh, Ángel!
Not a word of this to Carmela.
Ángel, no.
It would break your heart to see what Juan Raúl has become
Let me out of the car.
I mean it, Ángel, let me out!
I thought you knew something about love.
I'm burning.
I'm burning. No...
It's so...
Felipe is burning in hell.
I believe
hell is here on earth, Dottie.
Hell is waiting for the worst
to happen,
for the sound of your own execution,
and it never comes.
Hell is waiting for the best to happen,
and it never comes.
Never comes. We'll never be save, Tití.
Our only deliverance
is to stop waiting,
to expect nothing,
to love
desperately,
without hoping for another.
Ah, Mrs. Pérez?
Dottie?
Dorita.
My name is Dorita.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Last night I talked to Teresa,
the daughter.
This is very difficult for me to ask.
Do you love Juan?
Would you give him up?
When I dream about coming here,
I never dream about Juan.
I want a man who is free.
The way I thought the United States was free.
Inside of him free.
After so many years,
how could the gods have planned it this way?
Exactly.
Ángel thinks I'm stupid and romantic
because I really, really think
that Carmela and Juan belong together.
She waited a long time for him.
More than I would wait for a man.
At the Varadero Festival tonight,
I'm singing.
Then I'll make my surprise announcement.
A man and a wife who have not seen each other in 20 years,
we're going to reunite them right here.
Don't tell Juan, okay?
We're not going to talk to Carmela anything.
You're so handsome.
What is it?
Is it Felipe?
I love you.
Never leave me.
I want to dance with you.
You're so beautiful.
Back. Come on.
Oh, my God.
Excuse me.
Hey, Flavia! I'm sorry! I love you!
Marielita soy. Cubanita soy.
Juan Raúl,
no matter what happens...
Dorita, no more waiting.
Juan.
Shit. Carmela!
Juan Raúl is here!
Hey! Carmela!
Look! It is Juan Raúl!
Look at me! Hey! Carmela!
It's him!
Oh, shit, look, there's Juan Raúl!
Gracias!
Can't you see?
- Carmela?
- <i>Gracias.</i>
It's not the Marielito!
There are two very special people here tonight,
a husband and wife who haven't seen each other
- in 20 years.
- <i>It's not the Marielito!</i>
<i>He...</i>
Carmela, no!
Ángel! Ángel!
Juan.
Tití! Tití!
I'm okay, I'm okay.
It's just my hand... again.
Call a doctor.
Okay, family reunion. Big smile!
You look so much like my mother.
Tití, you're so brave.
Do you love me?
Um, listen, we just wanted to thank you for everything.
All your kindness to my father, I mean
- you didn't even...
- It was nothing. Nothing.
If there's something I can do for you...
I'll see you at the hospital.
The cops have to finish the paperwork
before we can go, but I'll take care of it.
You go relax.
Um, maybe I should follow Angelito to the hospital.
No, no, no. You guys take it easy.
Flavia is going with him.
You have some catching up to do.
Doesn't she look like my mother?
She's always saying that.
That's the eyes,
so like your grandmother.
I want to know all about her.
I can't believe you're really here.
In fact, I have a lot of questions for you.
So, get ready, okay?
Talk to him, mami.
You've been a good mother.
No. Teresa is good.
She's a good girl, but she's an American.
Who could ever imagine we would have
an amricana for a daughter?
Does she remember me?
She says she remembers dancing with you.
But time goes by.
It's hard to remember everything.
Papi, just sign some papers, and we can go.
Happy?
I don't know.
An hour ago, my life was clear
for the first time in 20 years.
And now...
Just talk to him, mami,
the way you talk to me.
Because whatever happens now,
we'll always be the Pérez family.
I imagined this moment so many times,
but never like this.
But, still,
I'm sorry I came to you like this.
Oh, no. I'm so happy you're alive.
I'm glad I didn't shoot you.
It would've been a privilege to die in your arms.
I used to lie in the dark,
assembling your face like pieces of a puzzle.
You're so beautiful.
Exactly as I left you.
I was only a child,
younger than our Teresa is now.
Younger than Teresa?
Sí. And you weren't much older.
Thank you,
for keeping our family together.
But now I feel so sad that a woman,
so beautiful and so young,
waited all this time,
for only me.
But you waited.
Yes.
But it was no sacrifice for me.
In prison you have no choice.
I didn't have the guts to let go.
I felt you close to me,
as if you were holding me,
and I couldn't let go of you,
until you let go of me.
And then, one day
I could no longer remember your face.
I'm finished with dreaming.
Dorita!
Dorita.
Corazón.
You taste like sugar cane juice.
Papi.
Always he's looking for Cuba.
