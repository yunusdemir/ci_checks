THIS FILM IS A FICTION INSPIRED
BY REAL CHARACTERS AND EVENTS
<i>The story I'm about to tell you</i>
<i>took place at a time when
the sky belonged to a select few.</i>
<i>There were no low cost airlines.
It wasn't like today.</i>
<i>A plane was a plane,
not a bus.</i>
<i>It's a true story.</i>
<i>Like all true stories,
it contains a few lies.</i>
<i>It's the story of a liar.</i>
<i>The story of a man
who fooled an entire country.</i>
SMOKE AND MIRRORS
<i>My name is Jesus Camoes.</i>
<i>I was a pilot at the time
I'm telling you about.</i>
<i>I had money and prestige.</i>
<i>I had no need to get involved
in such matters.</i>
<i>But it was fun.</i>
<i>The sky belonged to a select few.</i>
<i>So did the world.</i>
It's weird to see you
dressed like that.
I'm meeting my wife for lunch
I want to impress her.
I'm turning 53,
it's time to change.
<i>This is Francisco Paesa.</i>
<i>In 1995 we were involved
in handing over</i>
<i>the most wanted fugitive
in the history of Spanish democracy.</i>
Have you looked at what's inside?
This.
It's a locker in the North Station
in Paris.
What will you do with
that much money?
What will <i>we</i> do.
We'll see.
He won't be out for a while.
We have plenty of time
to think about it.
I'll be back in a month.
Judge Ferrer will call you to testify.
Don't worry, everything's in order.
What if she asks me about you?
Tell her the truth.
That I'm your friend.
An advance.
I have to go.
<i>That was the last time I saw him.</i>
<i>A few months later I got a call
saying Paco was dead.</i>
<i>But let's get back to the beginning
of the story.</i>
Thank you.
I need two SAM 7 missiles.
For who?
For ETA.
<i>During the most violent years
of the ETA terrorist group</i>
<i>Paco was sent to buy
two missiles with homing beacons</i>
<i>to lead police to the heart
of the armed group.</i>
ETA's a hornet's nest, Paco.
You should stay out of there.
The pay is good.
I could pay you better.
You can't work only for
the Spanish Secret Service.
Having only one client
will get you in trouble.
It's my country.
Money is your country.
Don't fool yourself.
And that of many others.
300,000 francs, up front.
Give me a couple days,
I'll see what I can do.
<i>A police operation in Hendaye</i>
<i>in the Atlantic Pyrenees...</i>
<i>It was the biggest raid ever
on the terrorist group ETA.</i>
<i>Part of their arsenal was found.</i>
<i>And, more importantly,</i>
<i>their system of blackmailing
Basque businessmen was uncovered.</i>
<i>From that moment on,</i>
<i>Paco became one of ETA's
biggest targets.</i>
Rafael!
<i>Rafael Vera,
Head of State Security.</i>
- What's up, Paco?
- How are you?
<i>Better known as The Gypsy.</i>
- They haven't paid you yet?
- Not yet.
That's odd. I'll call them right now
and take care of it.
<i>They had promised him
100 million pesetas for the operation.</i>
<i>Two years later,
he still hadn't been paid.</i>
Hi, Paco. It's me.
Your money has been sorted out.
<i>He was never paid.</i>
I've got something else for you.
<i>He was sent to blackmail a GAL witness.</i>
<i>GAL: the Spanish government's
anti-terrorist death squad.</i>
<i>An easy job.</i>
<i>He only had to convince her
not to testify against her boyfriend</i>
<i>and compromise
the Spanish government.</i>
<i>It was the only time
Paco wasn't suspicious.</i>
<i>As soon as Paco 's face
was made public,</i>
<i>nobody wanted anything
to do with him.</i>
<i>After that, he had to flee Spain
for 5 years.</i>
<i>When he came back,
nothing was ever the same.</i>
Gentlemen, I want you
to taste this wine.
There are only 50 bottles
in the world like it.
Wonderful.
- Spectacular.
- I'm glad you like it.
I had a bottle sent to each of you
at your office.
That leaves only 46.
We brought the contracts.
As agreed, I included a clause
specifying each party's contribution.
We can set up the company
in Sao Tome.
Off shore, of course.
Being an ambassador
has its perks.
- It's a lot of money.
- Fifty-fifty.
Still, it's a lot of money.
Nobody said getting rich
was cheap.
We brought something too.
A file.
- What file?
- Not what file, whose file.
<i>A good file investigating someone</i>
<i>is always a bad file.</i>
<i>And that file proved</i>
<i>that everything Paco had was fake.</i>
<i>His million-dollar estate,</i>
<i>an office in one of Madrid's
nicest areas pending seizure,</i>
<i>and a house in Las Rozas
belonging to Gloria Villalba...</i>
This is the only thing that's his
in this house.
<i>...his wife of 15 years.</i>
Is it real?
<i>As far as his fortune...</i>
<i>Two accounts in the red</i>
<i>and a bank loan never granted</i>
<i>that Paco punctually applied for
every 3 months.</i>
We also know that you worked
for the Spanish Secret Service.
But that didn't go very well.
They tricked him.
Paco was set up.
The pilot.
He's your assistant, partner,
- friend?
- Jesus Camoes.
You've known him for 20 years,
he's married and has 2 kids.
Quite a family man.
<i>I admit it.
There was a time in my life</i>
<i>when I was excessively sociable.</i>
You're not in jail because
this gives you diplomatic immunity.
A gift from your friend,
George Starckmann,
the weapons dealer.
Forget the business world.
With a life like yours,
you should write a book.
Don't worry,
we won't call the police.
Get out.
Don't drink that, you'll get sick.
Pour me some.
<i>The only thing the file missed</i>
<i>was an old Jaguar in his name.</i>
<i>Besides that car,
Paco had lost everything.</i>
Hi.
I put your things
in the bedroom downstairs.
You can use it
until you find something else.
<i>That was Paco 's life
until Luis Roldan showed up.</i>
THE SIDEKICK
<i>Luis Roldan,
the Spanish Police Commissioner.</i>
<i>In charge of more than
70 thousand men.</i>
<i>One of the most respected
members of the government.</i>
<i>Relentless in the fight against ETA.</i>
<i>Hand-picked to be the next
Minister of the Interior.</i>
I'm sorry.
I had an important call to make.
Your ash.
Julian says you get along well
with money.
Like any other relationship.
We have our moments.
How are things right now?
It depends what for.
Imagine you have to save an account
that's in danger.
Where is this account?
Switzerland.
- Where did the money come from?
- You're in the money business
and you have moral prejudice?
Please, get to the point.
I asked the wrong question.
How much money?
Quite a bit.
And there are two houses
we want to keep.
One in Paris and the other
in the French West Indies.
Can you handle that as well?
Perhaps.
That's not good enough. Can you or not?
Put out your cigarette.
I can do it for one million dollars.
That's a lot of money.
We're good.
There's something else.
A serious inconvenience.
Information will come to light
that's harmful to me.
What does it say?
Something you wouldn't like
said about you.
Is it true?
This is Spain.
Would that change anything?
- When is it coming out?
- Soon.
We need to be ready.
And please, be precise.
We don't have much time.
You should leave the country
at once.
A little distance
is always a good thing.
<i>Sergeant, bring that rabble
to order.</i>
<i>Yes, sir. First division,
step forward.</i>
<i>You're disobeying
a direct order.</i>
Yes?
Yes, Minister, sir.
No, no, I was reading.
Of course I know about the committee.
Don't worry, Antoni.
You can call me to testify
anytime. I won't leave Madrid.
I promise.
<i>That lie would force the Minister
of the Interior, Antonio Asuncion, to resign.</i>
- Where are we?
- We just passed Perpignan.
- Want me to drive a bit?
- No, I'm okay.
Go back to sleep.
<i>I have an apartment in Paris.</i>
You can stay as long as you need
while we sell the houses
and see what we do
with that money.
If you don't like it,
I can put you somewhere else.
Don't try to be modest,
you're no good at it.
- Do you know the neighbors?
- They're Dutch. They're away.
They're almost always
out of town.
That's Hans. My assistant.
Your assistants
are all so discreet.
I know that today is your
anniversary. Congratulations.
I booked you a table
at a very special restaurant.
The reservation is at 7:30.
Hans can take you
and bring you back.
How did you know
it was our anniversary?
It's my job.
<i>That was one of Paco's
better skills.</i>
<i>Know more about people
than even they did.</i>
Thank you.
Here's the key.
Call me if you need anything.
Enjoy your dinner.
- I'm going to change.
- Okay.
IN CASE YOU DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO GET HER
ANYTHING. HOPE SHE LIKES THEM - PACO
<i>Do you trust him?</i>
<i>We have no choice.</i>
What if he keeps it all
for himself?
He's a friend of Julian's.
Julian would never do that.
You're here with me.
Nothing will happen to you.
You look beautiful in that blouse.
I'm pregnant.
Come here.
Luis, please.
You're embarrassing me.
Sit down.
Is that yours?
Happy anniversary.
They're beautiful.
First we'll secure the houses.
We'll see what we do
with the money.
<i>The strategy to save Roldan's
houses was simple.</i>
<i>He only needed someone
with little or nothing to lose.</i>
<i>Better nothing.
Basically, a slave.</i>
<i>In this case, he chose
Americo Casturelli.</i>
Americo Casturelli. Lawyer.
<i>Almost a lawyer.</i>
Nice to meet you.
Please, sit down.
When did you arrive?
That doesn't concern you.
Here are the contracts.
<i>Majority and only shareholder
of the Omerlade Investment Group,</i>
You can speak French,
I understand it perfectly.
The houses are magnificent.
I'm happy to buy them from you.
Especially with your own money.
Don't give me that German look.
I haven't had a drink in two years.
Two years?
Two months.
Believe me.
It's true!
<i>And it was.</i>
How's your mother?
She's doing better.
Give her my best.
Yes.
<i>At the same time,
Casturelli's company would sell</i>
<i>the properties
to two other companies.</i>
<i>The first, Tunisa, was in the name
of Jean Pierre Pinaud.</i>
<i>The slave of the slave.</i>
<i>A down-on-his-luck stockbroker
who lost clients</i>
<i>faster than furniture.</i>
Where is all your stuff?
Did you get robbed?
Not at all. I'm changing the decor.
I'm painting over there,
over there too.
I'll add a nice painting...
How is Paco?
Fine. He says hi.
<i>The other company buying,</i>
<i>was in the name
of Darijus Arlaukas.</i>
Hi.
- How are you?
- Fine, and you?
This is Casturelli.
Casturelli, Darijus.
<i>The sole administrator
of a company</i>
<i>located in Panama
not even he knew the name of.</i>
<i>The slave of the slave
of the slave.</i>
You want something to eat?
Okay, gentlemen.
Sorry for the delay.
Everything is in order.
<i>A few days later, a notary
legally buried</i>
<i>that mess of loans,
sales and acquisitions.</i>
<i>If the police ever found
Roldan's houses,</i>
<i>someone would always claim
the properties as payment for a loan.</i>
Thank you.
My pleasure.
<i>Roldan's houses were safe.</i>
<i>And so was Paco.</i>
We're good.
One more thing.
People are lying about me.
I want you to get me
an interview with El Mundo.
I know a lot of things
and I can prove them.
If they come after me,
I'll go after them. I want them to know.
The government,
the opposition party,
even the royal family.
Nobody is safe.
You already have enough enemies,
don't you think?
You shouldn't add any more
to the list. It isn't safe.
Please do as I ask.
In that case, I would recommend
publishing it on May 1st.
People read the paper more
on holidays.
<i>The ex-police commissioner
is suspected of...</i>
<i>1.2 million pesetas a month
in mortgages</i>
<i>with a salary of 600,000.
A financial magician.</i>
<i>Formal charges against Roldan,
including tax crimes...</i>
<i>Embezzling public funds...</i>
<i>Accused of having embezzled reserves</i>
<i>from the Spanish Ministry of the Interior.</i>
<i>Police have requested
his passport be withdrawn...</i>
<i>Police suspect that he's fled
the country and some even say</i>
<i>with compromising documents.</i>
<i>I have two alternatives.</i>
Either shoot myself
or come clean
and tell the truth.
And when I say come clean,
I mean with all the consequences.
Absolutely all of them. They won't
trick me like they did Amedo.
If I go to prison,
I won't go alone.
I'll take them all with me.
What are you going to do
with the memoirs you're writing?
Right now, write...
- How's it going?
- They're finishing up.
Did he take off his sport coat?
No.
He'll get dehydrated
in this heat.
Don't worry. He drank 4 cans
of Coca-Cola and a bottle of water.
Do you know her?
She's a tough judge.
JUDGE FERRER CALLS ROLDAN
TO TESTIFY
She's a woman. She has to be.
- When's his court date?
- Tomorrow.
What are you going to do?
What do you suggest?
Nine counts would be
a lot of jail time.
You can add.
Congratulations.
I don't pay you to say the obvious.
You're supposed to be smarter than me.
I'm sorry.
Luis can't go back there.
He's not well.
I'm afraid of what he might do.
I can put you in touch with someone
who can help you disappear for a while.
That's better.
I'm not used to your way
of asking for things.
- How much?
- A lot.
- And I'm not used to your answers.
- It's dangerous.
A lot of people want him dead.
And more after this.
He's accusing everyone.
Are you proposing we run?
Until when? Until you come up
with a better idea?
I'll testify.
They could arrest you.
No, they can't.
They have nothing on me.
Those are very pretty.
They're herons.
The Greeks said they represented
beauty, balance and wisdom.
He couldn't have picked them better.
Luis told me you're pregnant.
Don't leave any loose ends.
They're naming a new
police commissioner next week.
You know what that means?
No. Get to the point.
It means that the new commissioner
will be able to access your
husband's account in Switzerland.
You have to trust me,
or you'll lose everything.
Thank you very much.
I'll see you out.
Can we have a moment alone?
I'm a bad person.
No, you're not.
Why do you say that?
- Am I a bad person?
- Of course not.
- I'm a bad person.
- Honey, it's okay.
- I'm a bad person.
- It's okay.
It's okay.
Those earrings look great on you.
What do they mean?
Do they have any special meaning?
That I love you.
How is Luis?
Nervous. He's terrified
of being alone.
He won't be alone.
Don't worry.
I hope not.
I talked to Luis. He'll transfer the money
to your Aresbank account tomorrow.
How much money is it?
1.5 billion pesetas.
<i>1.5 billion pesetas</i>
<i>in government commissions
and reserve funds.</i>
<i>Quite a blow
to the Spanish Treasury.</i>
What about the briefcase?
You should keep it somewhere safe.
That information is your life insurance.
What briefcase?
<i>Luis and Nieves wouldn't see
each other again until one year later.</i>
<i>Nieves was accused of misprision</i>
<i>of felony and sent to prison in Brieva,</i>
<i>where she found inmates imprisoned</i>
<i>by her husband.</i>
<i>When they offered her
an isolated cell</i>
<i>she said that she didn't need
to isolate herself from anyone.</i>
1,200 people live in this tower.
You'll be safe here.
Nobody will notice you.
Hans will be here
for anything you need.
If you want to contact me,
call me and hang up after 3 rings.
We're good.
What's wrong with
your apartment, Pinaud?
It's being remodeled.
It won't be ready until next month.
I finally decided to redo the kitchen.
Besides the kitchen,
I told them to redo the floor.
So it will take some time,
that's always the case.
You always know when these things begin,
but never when they'll finish.
How is Paco?
Fine, I think.
He doesn't know I'm here.
I just came by to say hi.
<i>Almost lawyer.</i>
<i>24 hours after</i>
<i>Luis Roldan deposited his money
in Paco's account,</i>
<i>the money had already traveled
around the world twice.</i>
<i>From Madrid to Geneva...</i>
Hello.
Hello.
I'd like to make a transfer.
<i>From Geneva to Singapore.</i>
<i>From Singapore to Frankfurt.</i>
<i>From Frankfurt to London.</i>
<i>From London back to Singapore.</i>
<i>They called it
"riding the helicopter."</i>
<i>It was like making the money
disappear.</i>
Good morning.
Good morning.
Where's Hans?
Inside.
The German made coffee,
you want some?
No, thanks.
He's a little shy, isn't he?
Does he ever talk?
He doesn't like to talk.
And his Spanish is weak.
I like people quiet people.
They're smarter.
They think while the rest of us
yap too much. My father was like that.
I remember when I told him
I was going into politics he said:
"Luis, son, stay out of trouble."
And I naively responded:
"Come on, Dad.
Spain needs to be like France,
like Germany, like England...
A democracy.
Why should we be any different?"
And he answered:
"Because the people who live here
are Spanish."
Where is it?
My money.
Don't think you'll keep it
for yourself.
I know you moved it,
I would have done the same.
It's in Singapore.
Is that safe?
Yes.
You're a smart man.
Because you know that if they
catch me, they'll go after you.
We're handcuffed to each other.
This is my lawyer's number.
He's expecting your call.
Call him and tell him
everything he needs to know.
He'll check to see that
the money's still there.
How is my wife?
She's fine.
You're going back to Madrid, right?
I need you to get me
a TV and VCR before you leave.
I've made a list of movies
and novels for you to get me.
There you go.
I have to make the most
of my time.
<i>The ex-police commissioner's escape

THE EXPERT IN THERMONUCLEAR CENTERS
TWO MONTHS LATER
Good morning.
- Are you Francisco Paesa?
- Yes, that's me.
I'm Inspector Gonzalez,
Madrid Judicial Police. My assistant,
Deputy Inspector Bermejo.
- Nice house.
- It isn't mine.
- Would you like something to drink?
- No, thank you.
Please, sit down.
We're investigating
Luis Roldan's disappearance
and we'd like to ask you
a few questions.
I don't know if I'll be much help.
I only know what I read
in the papers.
<i>In the press,</i>
<i>according to the government's
erratic and expensive investigation,</i>
<i>Roldan had been seen all over the world.</i>
<i>This proved two things.
First,</i>
<i>that Roldan was everywhere and nowhere.</i>
<i>Second, that to most of the world,</i>
<i>all Spaniards looked just like Roldan.</i>
Police. Identification, please.
<i>In only three months,
Roldan had become</i>
<i>the world's most wanted
Spanish fugitive.</i>
Hey, I'm Spanish!
We know he visited your office
a few days before he disappeared.
What office?
Your office on Ortega y Gasset.
Where did you get
that information?
Do you know Jesus Camoes?
Goodbye.
Was that...?
- That was his wife?
- Yes.
- Pretty, huh?
- And smart.
He told someone
at a family wedding.
Sweetie, go sit with Mommy.
He didn't know he was telling
a police officer's wife.
I saw him a couple of times.
He needed advice on how
to set up a company.
You haven't seen him since?
What does Jesus Camoes say?
We know Roldan called Spain 3 times
from an apartment of yours in Paris.
Don't use the phone.
It's not safe.
We're good.
Don't worry. Bye, Mom.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Getting a glass of water.
Go back to bed.
That's possible. He was in Paris
in April and he stayed in my apartment.
He might have used the phone.
I haven't heard from him since.
Does the name Casturelli ring a bell?
Casturelli?
Good morning.
Good morning.
What can I get you, sir?
Tonic water with a slice of lemon, no ice.
<i>That evening his flight to Gibraltar
was delayed by an electrical storm.</i>
Would you like anything else?
<i>That flight hadn't been delayed
more than 5 hours in a long time.</i>
<i>He never took it.</i>
Mineral water, please.
No ice. In a small glass.
What are they drinking?
Give me a shot of that too.
I'm going to try it.
You only live once.
But just one.
Just to try it.
Only one.
My God!
<i>He was picked up drunk
at Bern Airport</i>
<i>with 300,000 Swiss francs
in a briefcase.</i>
<i>He got 5 years in prison
for currency smuggling.</i>
<i>He should have gotten 15,</i>
<i>but he told the judge about the job
he did for Paco Paesa and Luis Roldan.</i>
<i>And he told him about
1.5 billion pesetas.</i>
Francisco Paesa.
1.5 billion.
Does that ring a bell?
We know you have an account
in Singapore with 1.5 billion pesetas.
I don't count it every night.
Where did you get 1.5 billion pesetas?
I don't have to answer that.
It's exactly the amount
Roldan took.
A coincidence.
A lot of coincidences,
don't you think?
How many coincidences
does it take to be a lot?
It's my money, Inspector.
It's not Roldan's.
Just in case,
Judge Ferrer has asked them
to freeze your account
in Singapore.
She's wasting her time,
they'll never do it.
Singapore law won't allow it.
- You don't know the judge.
- And I hope I never meet her.
<i>After Casturelli's testimony,</i>
<i>Paco's diplomatic immunity as Ambassador
to Sao Tome was endangered.</i>
<i>Without that protection,
they would accuse him again</i>
<i>of extorting a GAL witness.</i>
- Where are you going?
- Paris.
But I'm coming back.
I've heard that one before.
- It's the last time.
- That one too.
Go anywhere you want.
I'm bored of waiting for you.
You've gone and left so many times
I don't know if I want you to come back.
I'm telling you the truth.
That takes a lot of practice
and you haven't got any.
Don't forget the painting.
Have a good trip.
<i>He didn't say a word
about my mistake.</i>
<i>And I didn't find out what was really
happening until some time later.</i>
I told you we needed to be
careful with that drunk.
You should wear this.
You know what it is?
I was Police Commissioner.
Of course I know what it is.
That's not the question.
The question is why.
To stop bullets.
Do you know anyone in Venezuela?
My mother lives there.
Why?
The Spanish police are looking
for you there too.
They've asked the Venezuelan police
to collaborate.
They want you dead or alive.
Is my mother all right?
Yes, she is.
The rules have changed.
- What do you suggest?
- Professionals.
- I thought you were a professional.
- Another kind.
An international organization.
I know several that can help you.
I've spoken to your wife
and she agrees.
You can go back too.
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm not turning myself in.
You need protection, Luis.
Believe me.
Hired guns, right?
I don't need them, or this.
ETA tried to kill me 3 times
and I survived.
I'm not afraid of
the Spanish police.
It's not just the police.
Nobody.
Okay.
We need to make you a passport
just in case.
Have you got a photo
we can use?
Do you mind the music?
I never mind Brahms.
Turn it up.
Drive more slowly.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing, don't worry.
Turn when I say.
Now.
They're gone.
Relax. It was a false alarm.
It was like 3 or 4 in the morning.
I was reading before I went to bed.
<i>Alexandre Dumas. Lately
it's the only thing that relaxes me.</i>
<i>I wouldn't have thought about it</i>
but one minute later
I heard someone trying to break in.
Stay here.
Hans.
Wait here, please.
Jesus, stay with him,
don't let him leave.
Where are you going?
I'm not leaving.
<i>Pierre and Marie Roland.</i>
I've known them for years.
They say they were alone
the whole night.
My answer is yes.
To your suggestion.
The hired guns.
Contact them.
Now.
Would you mind
turning off the heat?
It is off.
Take off your trench coat.
I'm okay like this.
Relax.
I am relaxed.
Get your head down.
I said get your head down.
Don't let me out of your sight.
You can't come with me.
Stay here.
Where are you going?
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
You want to get killed?
Are you okay?
Get in the car.
They're waiting for you.
Does my wife know
where I'm going?
Only they know.
From this moment on, I won't have
any more contact with you.
If you talk to her,
tell her I'm waiting for her.
Please.
Luis, you can still change your mind.
Your money.
Good luck.
Thank you.
You too.
What about the 1.5 billion?
We already have our money.
That man is a time bomb. I want
to be far away when he goes off.
You're getting old, Paco.
<i>Totally the opposite.
He was in great shape.</i>
<i>We were exactly where Paco
wanted us to be.</i>
<i>Luis Roldan's whereabouts
remain unknown.</i>
<i>He's Spain's most wanted fugitive,</i>
<i>sought by 140 officers</i>
<i>in 12 countries on 4 continents.</i>
<i>What is this man looking for?</i>
<i>Extraterrestrials, a parking spot
or Luis Roldan?</i>
<i>The Ministry of the Interior
has not ruled out any hypothesis.</i>
<i>He was helped by at least
one other person.</i>
<i>A Civil Guard general, a drug trafficker
and a member of the Italian mafia.</i>
<i>He's protected by an underground
network of mercenaries</i>
<i>who transport fugitives
from one country to another.</i>
<i>Roldan is in hotter water
than ever before.</i>
DRACULA'S COACHMAN
THREE MONTHS LATER
Yes?
Captain?
You have a call.
- Yes?
-<i> It's me, where are you?</i>
About to land in Rome.
<i>When can we meet?</i>
In two days, why?
<i>My friend from Zaragoza
isn't well.</i>
- What's wrong with him?
- <i>His head.</i>
<i>He hasn't seen anyone
for too long.</i>
- Where is he?
- <i>I don't know.</i>
<i>They got in touch with me
through Stuart.</i>
<i>They asked me to negotiate his return
with Dracula's Coachman.</i>
I'll be there in 5 hours.
There.
- Minister, sir.
- Please, sit down.
Thank you.
This report was prepared
by my client Francisco Paesa
about Luis Roldan's situation.
I won't touch it.
- You read it.
- It's quite extensive.
Summarize.
First of all, my client complains that
whenever he works for the Ministry
he gets in trouble.
It happened with ETA and the GAL
and he doesn't want it to happen again.
So before negotiating, he wants you
to drop the lawsuits
and for the judges to find
some other amusement.
Leave him alone and let him
come back without any trouble.
How am I supposed to do that?
You're the Minister of Justice.
<i>Justice and the Interior.</i>
<i>The most powerful minister
in the government</i>
<i>and with the most ambition
to be president.</i>
What does he say about
Luis Roldan?
What do you say about
his conditions?
Tell him yes.
But first I want The Sidekick.
The file.
He says he's being protected
by an international organization
and that he can contact them
to negotiate the conditions
of his return.
When?
That's the wrong adverb, sir.
First is how much.
How much?
300 million.
That's a lot of money.
It depends on how badly
you want to win elections.
Or be president.
It's the perfect opportunity
to oust your competitors
and at the same time
clean your party's image.
Keep in mind the price increases
every day that passes.
<i>Coincidentally, like Roldan,
Belloch was from Zaragoza.</i>
<i>They called him Dracula's Coachman.</i>
He's one of Stuart's men.
That file must be Roldan's
final conditions for his surrender.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
The conditions of Luis Roldan's
surrender.
Summarize.
Two weeks from now.
In Laos.
Laos?
They have no extradition treaty
with Spain. It's perfect.
It will be an administrative extradition.
Not an arrest.
He'll only be charged with
bribery and embezzlement.
Spain will have to negotiate
your surrender, you'll do less time.
<i>How long?</i>
Five years, tops.
<i>We're good.</i>
All right.
It's okay, Paco. It's me.
Don't hold me to this,
but I'm glad to see you.
Have you ever seen me
with a gun?
Spanish spies only carry
a checkbook.
I don't need to see it
to know you're packing.
- What do you want?
- I'll be straight with you.
I have to catch a flight in one hour.
Where is he?
Who?
You know exactly who.
Who sent you, Minister Belloch?
A lot of people in the government
are looking for Roldan.
And which side are you on?
The good side, Paco.
Always the good side, you know that.
Who are they?
- The moving truck.
- A moving truck?
They're not ours.
I haven't seen him since
he was here with his wife.
When?
And the red car?
Not us either.
Months ago.
I don't know where he is.
I hope you're not lying.
And not to see you again soon.
For your own good.
I'm only warning you.
Have a good trip.
Pier Marie Laperrouze.
Of course I know him.
I sold him and his associate
weapons a couple years ago.
A guy named Rene.
He's a bounty hunter.
People are nervous
in your country.
This is serious, Paco.
What kind of trouble
are you in now?
I don't know if I can help you, Paco.
I'm waiting for a pardon from
Mitterrand and my hands are tied.
I'm getting out.
And you should settle down too.
You're getting older.
Do like me.
Take your grandson to a museum.
Get some botox, write a book.
I'm writing my memoirs.
Did I tell you?
Double.
I have a friend in the Mossad.
I'll talk to him.
For now, move across the street
from the Israeli embassy.
It's the safest place in France.
<i>The orchid mantis is a wonder of mimicry.</i>
<i>The individuals of this species</i>
<i>don't hide to remain unseen
among the orchids.</i>
<i>Instead they adopt
the appearance of these flowers</i>
<i>taking on their same color
and shape.</i>
<i>They also imitate
the petals of the orchids,</i>
<i>which when completely still,
the insects don't detect the deception</i>
<i>and fall directly into the trap.</i>
<i>Suddenly I realized
what was happening.</i>
<i>In the game of evolution,
the winners</i>
<i>are usually the specialists.</i>
- When did you change the lock?
- A while ago.
Hi, son.
- Why aren't you at school?
- I have a sore throat.
Well... How's the handball going?
I quit two years ago, Dad.
You look taller.
You've changed the place.
It looks nice.
Where's your mother?
She didn't sleep here.
Did he buy that TV?
Mom put your things
in the pool shed.
Who are you?
Please, put down the knife.
Why are you following me?
What do you want?
You don't remember me?
I'm Paco Paesa's friend. The pilot.
We met at John's marriage.
Shit. The pilot.
Yes.
Come on, I'll take a look
at that in the shop.
Hi, Pascal.
Hi.
Come in.
Look who's here. Alain Prost.
What's up, Jesus? Come in.
From Pascal.
You're early. The match starts
in 45 minutes.
- What match?
- Real Madrid.
Microphones.
- You're a son of a bitch.
- Wait.
You've been lying to me all along
with your spy stories.
Jesus...
Last night I remembered
John's wedding.
Or should I stay Stuart,
and his friend
who sells cheese.
It's all a lie.
There's no international organization.
You made it all up.
Look at that.
- They've been following me for 3 weeks.
- They could be your friends.
Go down and ask them.
They won't be very friendly.
- Who sent them?
- I don't know.
Anyone looking for Roldan,
dead or alive.
That's why we're safe here.
- Where is Roldan?
- I can't tell you.
- You'd be in trouble if you knew.
- Let me decide that.
- I can't tell you.
- Why not?
Because you can't keep
your mouth shut.
I know you said you saw Roldan
in my office?
Hello?
What happened?
Luis? It's me!
Luis?
Luis? It's me.
Luis?
I couldn't go through with it.
I can't.
I can't even do that right.
Let's go.
I'll be right there.
You wanted to know where
Roldan is, right?
- Come with me.
- But no more tricks.
You have my word.
And you, keep your mouth shut.
I will.
Not that car, they know it.
Help me.
Here.
I'll lie down in the back seat.
<i>Luis Roldan,
Spain's most wanted criminal,</i>
<i>who had been seen
on five continents,</i>
<i>had never left Paris.</i>
What did I tell you?
I said not to bring him
Spanish press.
Throw it away.
Throw it away.
I know what I did is wrong.
I'm not a criminal.
I've done a lot of good things
for my country.
I have a family.
They can't treat me like this.
I only did what everyone was doing.
I won't turn myself in.
I'm the laughingstock
of the whole country.
They'll crucify me.
Are you sure?
Whatever you do, I need your consent
to move the money. Singapore isn't safe.
We have to physically withdraw it
and put it in another account
so there's no electronic trail.
I know someone who can do it.
Someone I completely trust.
If you don't turn yourself in,
you have to disappear.
And that means never seeing
your wife again,
or your family,
or your unborn son.
A new life, with nothing from
your old one. That's the only way.
And you know what it's like
to be alone.
Is that what you want?
If it is, it can be done.
First people will have to think
you're dead.
It's the only way
they'll stop looking for you.
I can help you fake your death.
We'll take you to some quiet country
in Southeast Asia
and get you a foreign passport.
Somewhere you can live in peace.
I can talk to your lawyer
and send you money
every month.
As much as you need.
You're rich, Luis.
Please, I wish to be alone.
Ludovico.
- How long has he been here?
- Four months.
He won't last much longer.
My order.
Luis.
Mrs. Gerve is dying.
I've been watching her die
for three months.
What do you want?
I think you should take this.
Trust me.
Yes?
- Hi.
- <i>Luis?</i>
<i>Luis?</i>
<i>Hi.</i>
Darling...
<i>- How are you?</i>
- Fine, and you?
- I really want to see you.
<i>- Fine.</i>
Thanks for the call.
I want control over that account.
You'll have it.
How?
Trusting my word.
Your lawyer is waiting for you
to call and give your consent.
I don't want your money, Luis.
You pay me enough.
It's your money and you'll keep it.
Trust me.
Remember, you're handcuffed to me.
If I go down, you go down with me.
I'm going back.
I can't live without my wife
and family.
They're all I care about.
I'll call my lawyer.
<i>- Yes?</i>
- Hi, it's me.
<i>Hi, Paco.</i>
Were you asleep?
<i>No, I just got home.</i>
<i>What do you want?</i>
I wanted to talk to you.
<i>- What for?</i>
- I'm tired.
<i>- Tired of what?</i>
- Of this.
Of everything.
I want us to be like we were
at the beginning.
For everything to be like it was.
<i>That's not possible, Paco.</i>
Why not?
I have money.
I have a lot of money.
We can live however we want
as long as we want.
I don't believe you don't love me
anymore.
<i>- How much money?</i>
- A lot.
<i>It's late, Paco.
I'm going to bed.</i>
<i>That's Beatriz, Paco's niece.</i>
<i>She's exactly like him.</i>
<i>A daughter to him.</i>
- Did you say anything to my sister?
- No.
Hi, Jesus.
Hi, Beatriz.
I'll show you your room.
- When do I leave?
- Tomorrow.
Where, Switzerland?
- Singapore.
- Singapore is expensive.
When have you ever
paid for anything?
You'll go to the bank
every morning
<i>and withdraw 4 stacks
like these.</i>
<i>How much is in each stack?</i>
<i>About 50 million pesetas.</i>
<i>200 million per briefcase.</i>
A little more.
I'm going to the hotel.
- Need anything?
- No, thanks, Jesus.
Oh, yes. Jesus.
Don't forget the stamps.
The next morning,
<i>you'll go back and deposit
the money in another account.</i>
<i>- Another bank?
- The same one.</i>
<i>Two floors up.</i>
<i>I hope I don't get lost.</i>
<i>In one week you'll have withdrawn
the 1.5 billion pesetas.</i>
<i>Always travel by taxi.</i>
<i>From the hotel to the bank
and straight back to the hotel.</i>
<i>Call me when you've made
the last deposit.</i>
Is it legal?
Completely legal.
- Are you sure?
- You should know.
I paid for your law degree
for a reason.
Whose money is it?
I want double what you were
going to pay me.
Excuse me.
Please, don't stop.
Keep walking.
I know you're Jesus Camoes.
You're friends with Francisco Paesa.
You work for him.
Who are you?
I work for Minister Belloch.
I want the route Roldan
is taking from Laos.
I'll give you 100 million pesetas
to get it for me.
My phone number
is in your pocket.
Call me on Friday at 2:30 P.M.
Be punctual.
<i>There were two reasons
they wanted</i>
<i>Roldan's route.</i>
<i>First, an arrest</i>
<i>is worth a lot more
than someone turning himself in.</i>
<i>The second, it left Paco
on the sidelines.</i>
- How was your trip?
- Boring.
We'll take you to Disney World later.
The meeting with the Laotian
ambassador is in half an hour.
Roldan's extradition papers.
Are you okay?
I'll be back in 20 minutes.
Bad night?
I'm not used to sleeping alone.
There he is.
Here you go.
The extradition papers
signed by the Laotian government.
If you've never been to Paris,
you have a couple days to see it.
You're flying to Laos next week.
Here, this is for you.
What is it?
Singapore accepted
Judge Ferrer's request.
In two weeks we'll know if she
can access your account or not.
I warned you.
- Have you finished?
- Please.
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.
Shall I take your plate, sir?
I'm finished, thank you.
I changed the route.
It's all in there.
No, not here.
Put it away.
You leave at dawn.
You'll fly in a private jet
and you're the pilot.
Tell the police we're moving it forward.
Their tickets are in there too.
They'll take a commercial flight.
First class.
I don't want them complaining.
You should quit smoking.
That cough is sounding worse.
Does a cough ever sound good?
I'm going to the men's room.
<i>Those 3 lines were worth
100 million pesetas.</i>
<i>The most expensive lines
in the world.</i>
This is Jesus Camoes.
I'm not interested.
My answer is no.
How are you?
Everything okay?
Fine. The usual. My wife is bored
and making my life hell.
How are your kids?
<i>It was the first time</i>
<i>that Paco had asked
about my family.</i>
- Good. Growing up.
- Your dessert, sir.
The best dessert in Paris.
<i>I never found out
if Belloch's proposal</i>
<i>was real
or if Paco was testing me.</i>
<i>Whatever it was,</i>
<i>at that moment
I felt like I had passed.</i>
<i>With time, I discovered
that I was wrong.</i>
OPERATION LUNA
Your passport.
Thank you.
Thanks for respecting
my first name.
You'll fly with Jesus and Hans
to Bangkok,
where two Laotian policemen
will hand you over to the Spanish police
and they'll take you back to Madrid.
Like we agreed, it's not an arrest.
In less than 3 years you'll be
playing in the park with your son.
We're good.
I left your bulletproof vest
in the bedroom.
Have a good trip.
I'll wait downstairs.
You're taking that with you?
Don't be foolish, Luis.
They'll take it from you
the moment you set foot in Spain.
And you need it, believe me.
It's life insurance for you
and your family.
Let me hold onto it for you.
You still don't trust me?
Would you trust someone like me?
I see myself in you.
Please, don't make me judge myself.
I already have the whole country
doing it for me.
I've never judged you.
All in clue time.
We're not in a hurry anymore.
I wish you the best, Luis.
Thanks for everything, Paco.
<i>The 25 yards from the door
to the car seemed eternal.</i>
<i>We were transporting a man
everyone wanted dead or alive.</i>
<i>Someone could come out
of any window, of any balcony</i>
<i>or any shadow,
and put an end to it all.</i>
<i>Being close to him
put us in the same place.</i>
<i>In the middle of the same
crosshairs.</i>
You should get your head down.
I'm fine like this.
Good morning.
Good morning.
<i>That morning, from the airport
with the least surveillance in all of Paris,</i>
<i>a private jet was to take off heading
to Rome.</i>
<i>Rented by a businessman
named Hans Henry.</i>
<i>The plane would be piloted</i>
<i>by Captain Jesus Camoes
and his co-pilot, Luis Ibañez.</i>
All right. Bon voyage.
Thank you very much.
<i>Beatriz had been</i>
<i>erasing all traces of Roldan's money
withdrawing it in cash.</i>
<i>Paco never told his niece
that if they granted</i>
<i>the Spanish government's
request,</i>
<i>anyone who touched that account</i>
<i>could be arrested.</i>
<i>Or that it was Singapore's last day</i>
<i>to decide on the matter.</i>
Wait here a moment.
- Thank you.
- Go in.
Something to drink?
A Coca-Cola. I have money,
can I get you something?
No, thank you.
You have to write them
before we leave
to send them from Laos.
They're for your wife.
"Laos.
The country of a million elephants."
<i>That was true. Although
there were only 500 left.</i>
And take this money.
It's Laotian.
Your story will be more believable.
We're good.
Very ingenious.
Can you leave me alone
to write them?
- I'll get your Coca-Cola.
- Thank you.
<i>Roldan would be remembered
as the man arrested in Laos.</i>
<i>Those postcards were as close</i>
<i>as he would
ever get to that country.</i>
<i>The money,</i>
<i>Roldan's 1.5 billion, was safe.</i>
<i>And in Paco's hands.</i>
Yes?
<i>They just deposited
the 300 million for Roldan.</i>
Thank you.
We have to go.
This is for Paco.
Give it to him when you get
to Madrid. He's expecting it.
And tell him yes,
I trust him.
What he's after is in a locker
in the North Station in Paris.
Tell him he'll have to trust me.
Let's go.
Give me a second.
They're Laotian police.
Captain Khan and Inspector Mei.
They have to escort us.
Goodbye.
<i>That was the end.
After 310 days in hiding,</i>
<i>Roldan could go back to Spain.</i>
- Yes?
- <i>It's over, Paco.</i>
You can go back to Spain anytime.
Hi.
Hi.
It's over.
I'll never leave again.
I was about to have a glass of wine.
- Would you like one?
- Yes.
<i>The minister gave a press conference
to inform about</i>
<i>Operation Luna, which ended
with Luis Roldan's arrest.</i>
<i>We received convincing information</i>
<i>that Luis Roldan was in Laos,</i>
<i>the Laotian government
contacted</i>
<i>our ministry</i>
<i>assuring us that the information</i>
<i>was correct</i>
<i>and we asked them</i>
<i>to proceed with his arrest</i>
<i>and to hand him over to us.</i>
<i>Roldan was arrested and charged
with all the crimes</i>
<i>Spain had accused him of.</i>
You're making a mistake.
We have a deal.
I signed an agreement
with the Spanish government.
<i>Francisco Paesa has emerged
as the Judas who turned the fugitive</i>
<i>over to the police,
but Minister Belloch chose not to reveal</i>
<i>his possible involvement
in Roldan's capture.</i>
<i>The Spanish government
has never made any deal.</i>
<i>We don't make deals
and we don't negotiate.</i>
<i>And I think it's good news</i>
<i>that our institutions work.</i>
<i>In less than a year,</i>
<i>Paco had gotten everything back.</i>
<i>He could have stopped there,</i>
<i>but Paco would never do that.</i>
LAOTIAN GOVERNMENT
SPANISH GOVERNMENT
This came for you.
You have to come
and get something.
Right away.
- Julian Blanco?
- Yes.
This is for you.
TH E LAOTIAN PAPERS
That junkie Pinaud screwed up again.
- Why?
- The seal
is from City Hall in Laos,
not the Laotian Ministry.
What should I do, return it?
<i>The Laotian government confirmed
that Luis Roldan's</i>
<i>extradition documents
were forged.</i>
It's perfect.
I'll be back in 20 minutes.
Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
- Yes?
- The men's room, please?
- Yes, down there.
<i>There you go.</i>
The extradition papers
signed by the Laotian government.
THE COUNTRY OF A MILLION ELEPHANTS
The one at the register.
Captain Khan.
He's Vietnamese.
Vietnamese?
Yeah, but he served in the military.
And he's a gentleman.
He's a cripple.
He's a cripple.
I knew you'd like it.
<i>Laos also confirmed that
Roldan never entered the country</i>
<i>and therefore
there was never any arrest.</i>
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
<i>In fact,</i>
<i>nobody had ever
spoken to them.</i>
What's the other guy's name?
Inspector Mei.
Very good.
<i>Laos hasn't ruled out
that Roldan's arrest</i>
<i>might have been a secret mission.</i>
<i>We don't know any Captain Kahn.</i>
<i>No Laotian police officer
handed him over in Bangkok.</i>
<i>Was it an arrest
or a surrender?</i>
<i>We never granted his extradition.</i>
<i>We've found no trace
of his presence in Laos.</i>
<i>Many people are calling for Belloch</i>
<i>to resign, claiming that
the minister was tricked.</i>
<i>The former police commissioner
claims he was fooled.</i>
<i>What's going on? That's the question
Spaniards are asking.</i>
<i>His surrender to authorities,
unlike what was previously thought,</i>
<i>has not calmed the political climate
in this country.</i>
ROLDAN NEGOTIATED HIS RETURN
THROUGH LIMITED EXTRADITION
<i>It was all a lie.</i>
Minister, sir, they're waiting for you
at the press conference.
<i>That was the end of Belloch's
spectacular run for the presidency.</i>
<i>That was the beginning of the end
of everything.</i>
Can't you knock
like everybody else?
It's a habit.
Have a seat.
What do you want?
I came to make sure
you'd left.
Well, now you can see.
I guess I came too soon.
Next time I'll come later.
This is my second warning,
Paco.
You can come anytime.
You're in trouble, Paco.
I have Roldan's documents.
You can't touch me.
I don't believe you.
I don't think you'll dare
to find out.
You know there's nothing
in those documents.
They won't protect you
from the law.
Unless you want to spend your life
in prison, you know what you have to do:
disappear.
And we both know what that means:
No more Gloria.
No more Spain.
A new life with nothing
from the previous one.
Disappear, Paco.
You have no choice.
Goodbye, Paco.
<i>That was the last time
Paco saw Gloria.</i>
Have you looked at what's inside?
This.
It's a locker in the North Station
in Paris.
What will you do with
that much money?
What will <i>we</i> do.
We'll see.
He won't be out for a while.
We have plenty of time
to think about it.
I'll be back in a month.
Judge Ferrer will call you to testify.
Don't worry, everything's in order.
What if she asks me about you?
Tell her the truth.
That I'm your friend.
Yes?
<i>Hello, Jesus.</i>
<i>On July 21st, 1998,</i>
<i>Paco's niece called me to say
that her uncle</i>
<i>had just died of a heart attack
in Bangkok.</i>
Hi, Hans.
I came to bring you Paco's things.
He said that if anything ever happened
to him to bring you flowers.
I didn't know what kind to get.
Thank you, Hans. They're pretty.
<i>Roldan was put on trial
for all his crimes</i>
<i>and sentenced to 30 years
in prison.</i>
<i>He was placed in
solitary confinement</i>
<i>in the same prison
where his wife had been.</i>
<i>He served 15 years in jail.</i>
Hey, Alejandro!
Come to Daddy.
<i>Nieves separated from Luis a few months
after their second child was born.</i>
Yes?
<i>Jesus, how are you?</i>
Who is this?
<i>Jean-Pierre.</i>
Jean-Pierre who?
<i>Pinaud. Jean-Pierre Pinaud.</i>
Hi, Jean-Pierre.
It's been a long time.
How are you?
Better than ever.
Casturelli's dead.
<i>One week after he got out of jail,</i>
<i>they found him at home
shot in the head.</i>
<i>These things happen, huh?</i>
<i>There's something else.</i>
<i>What?</i>
It's Paco.
I accidentally called him
the other day
and I got his voicemail.
Paco's dead.
Why does a dead man's
voicemail still work?
<i>Dead people don't get calls
from the living.</i>
<i>Jesus?</i>
Never mind that, it doesn't matter.
<i>Of course not.</i>
Maybe I'm more dead than alive
and that's why I hear it.
These things happen.
Okay, but...
that's not why I'm calling.
Can you loan me some money, Jesus?
<i>Not a lot, just a little bit.</i>
<i>He was right.
These things happened.</i>
<i>They found him on the bed
of the room he was living in.</i>
<i>He hadn't even taken off his shoes.</i>
<i>Hello, this is Francisco Paesa's voicemail.</i>
<i>Leave a message after the beep.</i>
<i>Like I said at the beginning,</i>
<i>this is the story of a man
who fooled an entire country.</i>
<i>He fooled me as well.</i>
<i>Except for a Lithuanian cook
whose whereabouts were unknown,</i>
<i>I was the only one
who could tell it.</i>
<i>For a time, I tried
to follow Paco's footsteps.</i>
<i>You might say I was unlucky.</i>
- Miss.
- Yes?
Are there any free seats
in first class?
<i>But there's no point.
I'm not like him.</i>
<i>I never was.</i>
<i>With time I found out that
the world I'd seen from above,</i>
<i>belonged to only a few.</i>
<i>In this story,
I was only a pilot.</i>
<i>In 2004,</i>
<i>right after the statute of limitations</i>
<i>had passed on his crimes,</i>
<i>Paco was found alive.</i>
Paco?
<i>When they found him,</i>
<i>he said he had retired
and was living off his savings.</i>
<i>He never called me.</i>
I'm not Paco.
