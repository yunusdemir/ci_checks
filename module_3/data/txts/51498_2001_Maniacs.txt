1864, Aprll 22nd.
I remember that day
llke It was yesterday.
A renegade troop
of Northern soldlers
fought In the so called
Clvll War,
raped our women,
murdered our chlldren,
even took out
my goddamn eyel
I can stlll hear
Granny's crles
as they burnt Pleasant
Valley to the ground.
They kllled us all,
doomed us
to a llfe In llmbo.
Nothlng more
than ghosts seeklng revenge.
Guess that's the way
the good Lord wants It.
Eye for eye, tooth for tooth,
as the Old Testament says.
One thlng's for certaln,
our souls aln't
ever gonna flnd rest
'tll all 2001 are avenged I
Yes, slr, name's Buckman.
Mayor James W. Buckman.
And here In Pleasant Valley,
the annlversary of our
traglc massacre has arrlved.
And so have we.
Knlves have been
sharpened for justlce,
table set for revenge.
We try to make sport of It
for the llttle ones.
No reason vengeance
can't be fun.
Only thlng mlsslng
are the Yanks.
And so, yet agaln,
we walt.
M ust admlt Granny's been
deeply loyal through the decades.
J ust aln't Into rubblng
ankles wlth her no more.
Last tlme we dld,
I popped my son.
Fllthy scum.
I think that's
them coming now.
What in the blazes-?
Yee-haw I
Come on.
# The South's
Gonna rise again
# The South's
Gonna rlse agaln #

# The South's
Gonna rlse agaln #
You aln't gonna

Sheriff Freeman here, done
tore down the detour sign
Will you please?
# Yeah I #
Damn!
What seems to be the problem
here, my good Sheriff Freeman?
The problem, my good man, is every
spring I get calls from State police
after your's llttle festlval,
looklng for mlsslng Northern folk.
U p 'tll now, I've played
ball wlth ya'll,
but now I've got Ben
sniffing around my butt.
"You've played ball, " because we've
paid you quite a generous bounty
for your stewardship, ain't
that right, sweet cream?
You dldn't mlnd me when you was
a cub scout, dld you llttle Davy?
No, ma'am.
You wouldn't be pretending
you can resist me?
No, ma'am.
That's what I thought.
Look, milk or no milk, I ain't dropping
the soap in prison for none of ya'.
Ain't gonna be
no more jamborees.
No more feastln',
no more klllln'.
None of it!
Is that clear?
Clear as
a nighttime kiss,
on a young
possum's cooch.
This town used to be a jeweI
on the crown of the South.
You maniacs squeezed it into a turd.
Now hush up, you big baby,
you're ruining all the fun.
Amen, Harper. Such Ingratltude
brlngs a tear to my eye
when I think of all the hard work
that went into making this thrill ride.
Am I
right, folks?
Yeah!
Damn you
and your thrill ride.
Well if that's how you feeI I'll
have to tickle you on the way down.
Hold on a minute,
wait a minute ya'II.
Come on.
Hold on.
We'll make a deaI.
No!
No deaI? No.
Fuck you and your maniacs!
Wait, wait a minute.
Bye-bye.
No. No!
Okay, folks,
what time is it?
Roll out the barreI!
The what?
Roll out the barreI!
I'm- I'm sorry,

We're already there.
Ugh!
# Rot in hell

Ah, well, Bucky,
if the Northern folk
won't come to the South-
Well, we'll bring
the South to them!
Rlght there on the road,
don't forget to check
the backseat.
Next week on Road Rascals
the Old South gets
a taste of Beverly Hllls,
as Amerlca's favorlte debutantes Rome

Watch out,
red states.
'Cause we're
coming your way.
I hear the South
smells llke shlt.
Isn't the Llberty
Bell In Georgla?
I hear they have these bugs there,
called chiggers, that sleep in your puss.
Those Mexican cleaning ladies
better not bitch us out.
My sister has got to
ditch that icky dead dog,
yeah it was sad when Biscuit died
but then Rome got it taxidermed.
I cannot stand my
sister's boyfriend, Falcon.
He's so gay. Hello?
Tina's, not for sure,
but, you know,
it's not like we're
married or anything, so.
Yo, yo, yo, what plays in
Georgia, stays in Georgia.
J ust don't tell Rome.
Right, bro?
All thls and more,
next week on Road Rascals.
So, that's the promo.
N ice.
Don't you
just love it?
Absolutely. Red

Rome and Tlna Sheraton,
the wlng of the left flylng deep
Into the heart of the rlghts.
I thlnk we're talklng
Golden Globe on thls one.
Why so
shortsighted, Jerry,
I mean, why not Pulltzer, or the Nobel?
What could posslbly
be more prlze wlnnlng
than these two jiggling their
tits across the heartland?
BristoI, please.
Well, I know Mommy's
little Biscuit loved it.
Didn't she?
Mommy's llttle Blscult
doesn't love anythlng any more,
wlll you bury that already.
It fuckln' stlnks.
Why do you have to be
such a goddamn tool, K-Jay?
I'm not the one smacklng
a stuffed corpse.
Tina.
Falcon.
Stop bagging
on the rat.
Ow! I mean, K, can't you show
Biscuit just a little respect?
Bro, who's on the fucklng
leash? You or the bag of sawdust?
Look, dude. I kiss her
ass, she makes me famous.
Fucking cheapskates put some damn
curtain like I'm the fucking hired help.
Where the fuck
are we anyway?
Iowa? What
the fuck Is In Iowa?
I shouldn't have
let you drive.
Will you get off
your rag already?
How many times
do I have to tell you?
Momma wants a hard shell taco when
all you got is a soggy chlngadera.
Shut up, baby.
I got a hard shell taco. You need
to supersize it. Now back to work.
Come on, come on.
There you go.
Now shut the fuck up
and suck it.
Yes, yes, yes, I can see. I can see It.

but here,
I'm the producerl
I'm the bossl There'll

There's no respect, I'm the fucklng

Fuck, fuck, baby.
We're full tlme party glrls,
Val. Okay? It's what we do.
And it's like, you don't
want us doing what we do.
Yeah, llke maklng me wear

or not letting Rome shave her head.
Girls, girls, it's not
about wearing panties
or shaving
your puss- Head,
It's about not lettlng these
parasltlc boyfrlends drag you down.
You gotta evolve
into modern women.
More like modern

Yeah.
How much is this
gonna cost me, Jesus?
Knowing your cheap ass, you probably
didn't even insure this piece of shit,
so I just made you
some money, bruja.
Look, they spelled it
the French way.
Where the fuck

Iowa.
How the fuck
did we get to Iowa?
Sorry, I was a little bit distracted.
Hey, we could

It would make

H m, I don't thlnk so. Thls
place looks way too creepy.
Yeah, It makes
Blscult's halr stand up.
That would be
the Formaldehyde, babe.
Dude, respect.
For once, I agree wlth the

Well, Granny,

guest is ready for his closeup.
Walt, dude, I don't wanna
have my plcture taken anymore.
Want has nothing to
do with it, M r. K-Jay.
That's rlght, boy.
I am sure,
that these fine Southern gentlemen
didn't want their portraits taken neither.
I am sure that they did
not want to be in this war,
and I am
especlally sure
that they did not want
their family and houses
burnt to the ground
by you Northern heathensl
Whoa! " Northern heathen?"
Dude, I'm from Burbank.
That's where
the devll llves.
Bye-bye.
Say cheese!
Oh I
Good boy I

Hell, yeah. Fresh baked.
What's your name?
It's H ucklebilly, dumb ass.
What's my name?
H ucklebilly, dumb ass.
Typlcal I I'm out there,
sweatlng my ass off,

getting this mentally
ill child stoned.
Shut the fuck up, retard!
It's H ucklebilly, M ister.
I promlse, I'll
just fllm It, no web.
So anyone know whether
Jackass ever found Brlstol?
Hate to brlng
It to you, Moses,
he's probably off plowing
BristoI in some corn field by now.
Excuse me, that's Rome's
boyfriend you're talking about.
Yeah, man, don't be a hater.
Suck my salty
Salvadorlan sack.
You'd probably like that. You
little twisted reality show wannabe.
Enough I Look, Jesus,
unless you want to crash the unemployment
line like the rest of your famllla,
I suggest you get
this tin can moving!
As soon as we get what we
want from these rednecks
we'll get the hell out of
this fucking two-bit shit hole!
Come on!
All right.
I hear you, boss.
I can scam
one of them tires
off that old schooI bus
those freaks got
Whatever It takes.
I wouldn't advlse
that, my frlends.
Some folks
around here
just might be inclined to
define that as stealing.
Stealing is
a sin.
I wasn't gonna
steal nothlng, abuellta.
I said "borrow. "
I guess borrowing is okay.
That ain't stealing.
Maybe we can help
you out with the tire.
But first-
Yee-haw I
I'll tell ya', Granny,
that dlsplay of majesty
makes this ColoneI
weak in the knees
and full
in the groin.
Ugh!
Bucky, I ain't
begging no more.
It's tlme you dlscharge your
musket, Confederate style.
Madam, lead me
to my executlon.
Yee-haw I
You'd better be getting all this.
This is money

Solld gold.
Oh!
Buck-man. Buck-man.
Buck-man. Buck-man.
Candy apples.
Buck. Buck. Buck.
Candy apples?
Yee-haw!
How do you like

My mighty sword!
My mighty sword!
My mlghty sword I
Crow! Crow! Crow!
Crow?

Oh,

Oh, oh, oh I
Ugh.

Yes!
M ighty fine.
Come on up

I ain't got
eternity. Come on.
Don't mind
the darkness none.
You ain't never heard
Helen Keller complain.
Turn around now, boy.
Step on rlght up on here.
Come one. Show everybody
your pretty face.
Now you see him?
U h-
Now you don't!
So, should I keep
the blindfold on, or-
U h, hello?
Hello?
So weird.
Ah, okay.
Hello?
Hello. Is anybody here?
Howdie ho there, boy.
What the fuck?
It hurts.
What kind of man are you, you
can't handle a little arm wrestle?
Shit, Rufus. I knew
you were different.
I knew you
were different.
You see right through me, don't you?
Right through
your heart.
My heart?
Yeah, you know, all my life
I've kept my heart in the closet.
Lately though, my ass keeps poking out.
Whoa! I ain't
queer like that!
But that don't mean you gotta stop.
I don't know.
Maybe you're right.
Listen, this is the
wrong time, wrong place.
I'm dead!
Ain't that the truth.
Ugh. Agh!
Agh!
I'll give you Brokeback.

Fuck this shit.
Ah I
Now, now, now that
you're all a llttle groggy
the fresh air otta
take care of that.
We're all here and we're
gonna play a little game,
a llttle game we call the
Revlsltatlon of the troubles.
ApriI 22, 1864,
we were living our lives,
minding our own business,
when the Yankee man came.
When you came! killed us all,
destroyed our way of life.
Hell, we weren't
ready back then,
but thls tlme we are.
War's over, jefe, you fucking
lost, move the fuck on!
Well, that's preclsely
what we alm to do,
muchacho, precisely.
You're telling me you're
with these crackers?
I was with these
crackers when your kind
came condemnlng us all
to the same fate.
"My kind?" What the fuck's
wrong with you, brother?
I'm not your bother.
I'm Southern bred.
And you,
M iss Gutter Mouth,
you'd be Northern scum.
Now, now, Crow.
Remember we're trying
not the use the " N" word.
You're right
on that one.
That's rlght I
Now let's see here, from here to
the road it's a couple of miles,
same dlstance we had to
flee from Pleasant Valley,
now, there's no sport In
shootlng flsh In a barrel.
so we hid some guns
and ammo along the way.
Now, If ya'll can go out there and
flnd them and put up a good flght
why, you're
free to go.
Oh, that is bloody bullocks!
If you don't
let us go now,
I'll have my lawyer slaughter
you before you can say spectrum.
I mean It,
mother fuckerl
Spectrum?
I'm not klddlng I
Nelther are we, Mlss.
I n case you have
any doubt, M iss Maiden.
H m.
K- Jay?
Ma-ma-ma-ma.
Falcon I
Bastards!
Presentatlon. Well,
let the games begln I
Pum, pum, pum.
Glmme that I
Gimme that!
# Bulldlng from
the ground up #
# Starting nowhere #
Did you see what they did to
K- Jay, Biscuit? They killed him.
They fucking
killed Falcon, too.
We were gonna present at the
Teen Dream Awards together.
You were?
# Well, they put us
I n our #
Crying over spilled blood is
not gonna get us outta here,
we gotta find those guns
and cap those mother fuckers.
You're right. You and
Cherry head for the RV.
Fix that damn tire, I'll grab
the girls and find those weapons.
What are you gonna
do if you find them?
I know my way around weapons. My
mother used to be a prison guard.
That explains a lot.
# Again #
Bleed that heathen
good and dry, son.
We could all use
an after dinner tonic.
When do we get
to eat supper, Daddy?
Aln't you done
chewlng on that surfer?
What about me, Daddy? AII I had was
a gristle from Jezzie's hindquarters.
Oh, enough I Stlflel
Go on, glt I
What are you
laughing at, China Rose?
Why don't you do some of that Chlnese
laundry we Imported you here for?
Thls tlme get out the blood stalnsl I
don't want no rlng around the collar.
Your wlsh Is my command, Mayor Luckman,
But remember,
not tickee, no shitee.
Go on, glt I
Well, I see there, Ganny,
looks llke you're favorlng that
dark meat a llttle blt too much.
Maybe if you were a little bit
more black in your stallion,
I wouldn't need to visit the
stable on long lonely nights.
How many Northerners to seek
vengeance on 'tll we can flnally rest?
Well, let's see, uh,
last jamboree I thlnk we
took care of 8 of them.
It's 9 here wlth thls now,
It still only makes
us half way to 2001.
Dang it, does that mean we have to
go through this shit again next year?
Ah, don't complaln.
Oh I My bunlons
are kllllng mel
If I was one of those psychos
where would I hide those weapons?
Kinda like
an Easter egg hunt.
H uh?
Yes.
How old is this piece of shit?
It's fucking rusted together!
Whatever. I'm gonna smoke
and laugh about all this.
Are you fucking
crazy, negra?
Those rednecks think this is
the CiviI War or something.
I always knew the South
was loco, but damn I
Shit!
Are you okay?
Fuck finding a tire. I say we ditch
those bitches and save ourselves.
Let's go.
The Kosher way
to do this is what?
You gotta cut the throat
and let the blood draln.
This Jew boy ain't
got no throat no more.
Well, then, cut
his balls off, I guess.
Yeah, I guess.
Speaklng of balls, I've been
meanlng to mentlon somethlng to you.
I just don't get you.
What?
You know.
Your taste.
Explaln me thls, brother.
You, brother, spend your time on
some soft girlie girI like JezebeI.
Gosslplng, shopplng
and settln' up house.
I, on the other hand,
like to hang a reaI man,
practicing,
soldiering,
and wrestling.
And my taste?
You tell me, brother, who's really
on the side of the Lord here?
You gotta be fucking
with me. This easy?
I guess not.
No ammo.
You're klddlng me.
Fuck this cracker,
VaI, let's go.
Slnce our llves
are serlously at stake,
there's something
I have to ask you.
Go ahead, babe.
If they find us
dead here
our bodies naked on display
for the whole world to see-
You mean like
in your video?
I'm being
serious, Tina.
Flne. Splll It.
All right. I'm just
gonna come out and say it.
Do my thighs
look fat?
Oh, my God I
Rome, a gun I
You thlnk It's real?
Ah I Tlttlesl
Ugh!
Looks reaI.
Fuck, we're goin'
around in circles.
I don't get it, Jay.
That's it.
Let's split up.
I don't wanna
split up. M m-hm.
Look-
If one of us gets away
we're both saved, right?
You know I'll
come back with help.
I guess
you're right.
Of course
I'm right, baby.
You go that way,
I'll go this way,
one of us is gonna
find the road.
Okay, but be safe.
You know I will.
What about a gun?
Don't I need one, too?
Well, at least
we found a gun.
Should I say
thank you for that?
It was an accldent,
Val. God I
Do you always have to rag
on us, we have feelings, too.
Yeah, like we didn't feeI bad
when the avalanche hit New Orleans.
Okey-dokey,

Oh, no, you
girls despise me.
Why can't you see me

Threel
Oops.

Yeah, we would never
fuck you anyway.
Yeah!
Ugh!
Yoo-hoo.
U h, uh, uh.
What the fuck?
Looking for
the U nderground Railroad?
Hey, Granny.
Do you think the Mayor would mind if
we kept that beaner boy to ourselves?
I don't know, sweetie. I'd rather
kill him than fuck him any day.
Sh, sh, sh.
Do you
hear something?
No.
# Rock a-bye baby,
On the tree top #
# When the wind blows #
# The cradle will rock #
# When the bough breaks
The cradle will fall #
# And down wlll come baby #
# Cradle and all I #
I always knew

Blscult's really

Yes, sweetie.
She really is.
We're dead meat,

No, Romy, we're gonna be okay. Trust me.
That's what you said the time
we got crabs tag teaming K-Jay.
Whoopsle-dalsy I
Oh.
I thought the Mayor
sald kllllng Mexlcans
dldn't count
towards the total.
No, they don't deary.
They aln't North, they
aln't South, they just aln't.
But there's nothlng wrong
wlth a llttle sport kllllng.
So long as it puts
food on the table.
It must've
been a squlrrel.
Come on along, now.
Peekaboo.
Ah!
Can't you Northern folks
do nothing right?
Tonlght at dlnner,
yet agaln,
caught Granny picking
a little too tenderly
on a dark part
of her brisket.
Got anything
to say about that, boy?
Ugh!
I ain't
nobody's boy.
Not even yours.
Maybe so, Crow.
Would it be too hard just
to, uh, stick to your chores?
Ah!
I do stick
to my chores,
as much as I find
them distastefuI,
And whlch one of you are too
tlred from ploughlng the flelds,
or splitting
the wood,
you can't
deny that.
Tell me, Is there one amongst ya',
one, amongst ya'
willing to hit it when
there's blood on the conch?
Well, I know
how to plow.
and I know
how to split,
but you sure have some
very satlsfled bltches
in your Pleasant Valley,
thank you very much.
Man's got a point.
Shoot, Daddy, I thlnk I
