Hit me.
I'm serious, I can't feel anything. Hit me!
Again! Do it harder!
I can't feel anything!
This is awesome.
I hear this little "wah, wah, wah"
inside my head.
That's your brain cells popping.
- Do it!
- You want me to do it?
Hit me! Harder! Punch me!
Hit me really hard. Really.
- Okay, I'm gonna punch you.
- Okay, go!
Oh, shit!
Yeah!
Come on, Hampton.
Come on.
Come on, baby.
Mom! Come on! It's 7:45.
Let's go. Let's go.
I'm ready. Hey, Noel.
- Mason, come on!
- Come on, Mason!
- Where's the new backpack?
- Already in the back seat.
Let me fix this before somebody
gives you the wedgie from hell.
- Mason!
- Come on!
What's up, guys? Hey, Noel.
Bitch.
What the hell?
- You're not allowed to wear that.
- Teachers look mean here.
Well, I promised myself I wouldn't get
anything lower than an A. Careful!
God.
How you doing, man?
Guess what just happened.
Dude! Look at that shit! Damn.
- That shit is tight!
- Mason.
Hey. Guys, this is my little sister.
- Hi.
- Look over there, man.
- There's Evie Zamora.
- She grew up this summer.
- No shit.
- Hey, Evie. What's up, girl?
- Let's go say hi.
- Be cool, dude.
What's up, Evie?
- Come here, I wanna talk to you.
- You see that?
Shit.
Now look up at me. Looks great.
Yeah. Next time we'll do orange.
(Hair gel, bah)”
It's okay, Mom.
You can borrow mine. Again.
Thank you.
Rodney, I love the blue.
Hey, go like this.
You guys hungry?
I did Italian tonight.
Hey, it's hot, guys.
Where'd you put the cheese?
Bye! Don't burn your tongue!
- Bye, Mel.
- Oh, thanks.
So long. Jesus, $2 tip?
They ate half the lasagna.
Mom, you're way too generous.
Dad send the check this month?
Lay off him, Tracy.
He just started the new job.
We're fine, hon. I'm hooked all week.
You'd look great with some honey-blond
entertainment streaks...
...right here.
It's not fair. I can't be mad
at you when you do that.
Here, Mom, listen to this.
<i>He was crippled
But only his body was cracked.</i>
<i>Tracy!</i>
- Hey.
- Hey, Kayla.
Hi. The bus never came, and then it did.
I have to pee,
and she hasn't eaten anything.
Well, that's okay.
There's some stuff on the stove.
- Okay, then we'll go?
- Tracy, I'm sorry.
I just haven't been to a meeting
all week and you know I need to go.
I really wanna hear your poem.
Come on.
- Please start over?
- It's okay, Mom.
No, please. I really wanna hear it.
<i>He was crippled
But only his body was cracked.</i>
<i>It's not simple
Nor is it an easy matter to explain.</i>
<i>"Let's just leave it at that," she says.</i>
<i>And closes the holy book of lies
She covers her eyes.</i>
<i>Denying to herself
What she thought happened.</i>
That's really heavy.
And it scares me a little bit.
It's beautiful.
We gotta talk about it
when I get back, okay?
Can we have some of this cake?
Oh, no, no, no! Shit!
That's Mario's cake!
He's 12 years sober!
- Tracy, I want a piggyback ride!
- Hang on.
Mom? Mom, Mom, Mom!
I told you I can't babysit.
I have an I-Search project due tomorrow.
Baby, baby, cut me a break! You know
I need to go! "Keep coming back!"
- "It works if you work it!"
- Right, baby?
- Mom...
- Bye, Mommy.
- Be good!
- Yeah. Thanks again!
Evie Zamora. Hey, girl.
Evie Zamora has really pretty skin.
I heard she has a huge scar from when
she saved her brother from a fire.
You guys, she's not Wonder woman.
- You guys, I'm wearing lip gloss!
- I'll see you guys later.
He's so smart too. He knows German.
Nice socks.
Who let her out of the cabbage patch?
Thank God you're cleaning
up your room.
You hungry, baby?
I'm not your baby.
<i>Okay -</i>
- Hey, what's wrong with those socks?
- Nothing.
Then what are they
doing in the trash?
I'm not going to wear them anymore.
I need new clothes.
- How come?
- Because I look stupid! Hello?!
Sylvia!
Sylvia! Stop!
Please! Emergency!
Mom. This one's okay. This is cool.
Yes. Mother scores.
Now I know I have another dollar
in quarters here somewhere.
Hey! Is this enough?
I could rinse these off.
Right on.
For the project, I'm doing J. Lo.
What about you?
- I'm doing Usher.
- I have to go to the bathroom.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Cute shirt.
Thanks. Cute belt.
Call me after school.
We can go shopping on Melrose.
<i>Okay -</i>
Write your number on this.
<i>Oh, my God!</i>
You get it?
Yeah, I have heard that one.
Yeah, that one': Good.
Damn. I have gymnastics today.
<i>- Oh, okay.
- Okay .</i>
- I'll see you later.
- I'll call you later.
- Bye. Love you. 'Bye.
I don't know. I just wish
she liked me, you know?
- I've been there.
- Tracy!
Mom says to clean your room
before she gets home.
<i>The number you have reached is not
in service at this time. Please...</i>
<i>The number you have reached is not
in service at this time.</i>
What happened over here,
Cockroachio?
Nothing, Lifeguard Boy.
Hey, come clean this shit up, Trace.
The pants without the pockets
make you have a better ass.
Tried calling you guys,
but I was coming here anyway.
My phone didn't ring.
<i>Ban appétit, darling.</i>
Shit. You guys, I only brought 10 bucks.
What?
I'm gonna go get a drink of water.
Loser.
What? What are you talking about? No!
No... Hang on one second.
The number for you. It's right...
Hang on one second.
I shouldn't be giving you the number,
you should have it. No.
His name is Alberto. I don't know,
it's something, some sort of...
...5-5-3 number, or Alberto,
I don't know. Something.
No. You just keep in mind
that you work for me!
I have 35 people coming tonight.
This is unacceptable!
I need the heater working.
I have to have everything there.
No, this is not right. Let's see,
hang on one second. It's 5-5-3...
- Not bad for 30 minutes.
- Sales clerks didn't see shit.
You guys.
- You guys!
- Check this out. Watch.
You guys, I totally just stole this.
- No fucking way.
- From this lady over there.
- Let's see how much.
- Have you seen what's in it?
- Holy shit, you guys.
- Oh, my God.
- I've never seen this much money.
- Let's go shopping!
Hell, yeah!
A few pairs of these.
That should cover that.
Keep the change.
- Oh, yeah.
- Let's go.
Hey, Mason.
Just out of curiosity, who do you think
is the hottest girl in school?
I guess Evie Zamora.
Guess who I hung out with today.
Bull.
Melrose Avenue.
What? God, it's that hard to believe?
Mom, why are there four places tonight?
Mom?
Honey, he just got back.
He's only coming for dinner.
Yeah, tomorrow he's just gonna
tune up your car, right?
It needs it.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
You mind if I put this stuff
in your garage?
So, Brady, how was the halfway house?
The same as the last one, Trace.
Evie, this is my mom.
No way. She's like the hot big sister.
What do you want me to do?
- Can you take us to Melrose?
- Oh, let's go.
Find some really cute platforms,
or maybe some of that body glitter.
No, Mom, it's okay.
Just drop us off and then go
run an errand or something.
Oh.
Okay. I guess that'll be all right,
maybe for an hour.
I have to talk to Evie's mom, though.
<i>Brooke is just my guardian.</i>
Great, thank you.
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.
I haven't talked to Brooke yet.
Mom, please don't do this to me.
This is the best day of my life.
I'll kill you if you embarrass me.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Hi. This is Melanie. I'm Tracy's mom.
Okay, I'll push it up.
What am I saying?
My boobs fit in everything.
It's my ass that isn't fitting.
Evie, Brooke says you're not allowed
on Melrose without adult supervision.
You're here, aren't you, Mel?
Yep. I am.
What do you think?
Mom? Do I look okay?
You look incredible.
You love the leopard fur, Mel?
Yep.
But not for 75 bucks, baby.
- Why? Mom!
- Guys! This only costs 19.95.
<i>This is it! This is the digs, the nest!
My Mount Olympus, baby!</i>
<i>- Hey, boys.
- This is it, this is the dream place.</i>
<i>- Hey, Evie.
- Check this out.</i>
<i>The design is set up feng</i> shui.
Dude, I want my $9 back.
Only way that movie would be decent is if
Britney had her booty hanging all over.
Yeah, with a car blowing up
in the background.
Hey, Christ, I at least wanted
to see some tits.
- Your little friend is coming.
- What?
Oh, shit.
- I'm Evie Zamora.
- Yeah, I know.
I'm Noel.
Pizza?
We love Hawaiian. Don't you, Evie?
Hey, hey, hey.
Let's go, Trace.
- You can't go to the park anyway, right?
- You can't go either after dark.
You guys wanna get high?
Four bucks a hit.
Let's trip. For sure.
We're in.
Pay me back when we get home.
- What's up?
- Guys wanna buy some shit?
Yeah. What you got?
I see spiders.
I see naked people.
My God.
Tracy.
<i>Tracy!</i>
Tracy! Come on.
Mom wants you home now.
Tracy, get over here!
- I found her, Mom.
- Oh, you guys got...
Yeah, Trace, I got that game
that you wanted. Finally.
- I'm a lion!
- Tracy!
You hounded me for weeks
for this damn game.
Oh, no, I haven't.
I really haven't.
Damn. How long is this gonna last?
<i>The itsy-bitsy spider
Dropped acid at the park.</i>
Evie, I think... I think
my nose is melting off.
Mel, she's a teenager. Come on, baby.
You want me to ground you?
You're not allowed out after dark!
Mom, God!
Can't I have any privacy?
I'm not allowed to see
your body anymore?
No, you're not.
<i>Boy.</i>
Well, after he leaves, we'll talk.
If he leaves.
Whoa, slow down on that
apple cider there, sweetheart.
Come here. Come here.
<i>Soto:</i>
...Mason says good night.
Mom, what's going on? Mom!
Go back to bed.
Nice ass.
Oh, no.
- Mom!
- What? I'm making your fave.
Mom. I have to go to the bathroom now.
Can't you hold it a minute?
That's how you get a
bladder infection, child abuser!
That's dramatic.
Let's just go pee outside, wussy.
French toast is my favorite too, Mel.
Hampton is my baby. You're my baby.
Hey, Mason. Move your
G-string down south.
Dude, no, that is so gross!
That's my brother.
- Oh, my God!
- Maybe I'll marry into the family.
You'll be designing a habitat which the
four of you will live in for two years.
Find creative ways to recycle
the elements.
Think water supply and power supply.
Why are you late, Miss Freeland?
Sorry. Can't a girl go to the bathroom?
All right, settle down, class.
- Hello?
- What I want... Put the phone away!
Do you know the difference between
point-slope form and slope-intercept form?
How about 10 dollars, guapo?
Well, see, that's why I need
to be here at the library.
- They have tutors.
- Hey, does her mom know?
She's 18. Come on,
I know you're a nice guy.
Okay, cool. Pick me up at 5:30. Bye.
Get on the chair.
Is this gonna hurt? Oh.
You haven't had your tongue pierced.
I only put it in when I need to.
Stick it out.
Just don't open your mouth very wide
when you talk. She won't notice.
I have to ask you something.
What?
Okay...
You never did anything with
that crusty tattoo guy, right?
Yeah, he ate my pussy.
Oh, my God! Are you...?
I'm kidding, idiot.
Hey, ladies.
Get a lot of studying done?
We were researching, Mom.
I'm in charge of the gray water module
for the Biosphere Two project.
What module are you in charge of, Evie?
I'm not in that class.
I'm taking advanced physics, Mel.
Well, I'm happy for him that he's
finally paying off his debt, but...
So what if he works weekends? You
had to work, and you had two babies.
It's not like I need it for myself.
- It's just that the kids are getting so...
- Mom. Mom.
Can you guys say "hot"?
That was Mason's favorite shirt.
You two aren't the only
J. Lo's in the house.
Check out these sexy colors!
That's great, Mom.
You need something to eat?
It's 4:00.
Something real? I'll make some
turkey and cheese on whole wheat.
Evil food.
You know if you drink 10 glasses of
ice water a day, you'll burn 300 calories?
Interesting.
Mom! Three strikes and you're out!
How many times you gonna
let him fuck you over?
Hey.
Where is my purse?
Cyn, Cyn, go to the sink.
Oh, yes, I'll rinse your color out now.
- I know that I left it right here.
- Baby, it's here.
Honey, find Cynthia's purse.
His clothes shouldn't be here.
You promised Mason and me.
- No, I never promised that.
- Yes, you did!
Cyn, come on. You're cooking.
You are cooking with gas.
- Really quick. Over here. Over here.
- God, this is so fucked up.
Put this over your face.
- God, you're burning me!
- Shit, I'm sorry.
- Fuck.
- There, how's that?
Oh, baby, you are blond!
That's weird, I thought I had
a bunch of 205 here.
- I have to write a check.
- Pay me next time.
Put a little gel on your hands and go
like this right before Larry picks you up.
Hey, if this gets you laid,
you owe me double.
Tracy Louise Freeland.
Conference time. Now.
You do not pull a scene like that in
front of a client. Even Cynthia.
- I'm on the phone.
- Well, get off the phone.
It's Dad.
He's with the baby.
- Don't ever start smoking.
- Is everything okay, Mel?
Yeah.
Not.
Evie, I'm sorry, but I think
it's time for you to go home.
I can't go home.
Brooke had a convention
in Bakersfield.
She said she sent you an e-mail.
I guess I didn't check my e-mail.
I'm sorry, Mel.
I hope it's okay that I'm here.
Well...
I guess it's gonna have to he, isn't it?
Her boyfriend hits me, Mel.
He grabbed my throat
and he threw me against his van.
Oh, Jesus.
Where's your mother, baby?
- Where's your...?
- She passed away.
I didn't have a mother
when I was your age.
I know how hard it is.
I do.
- Mom.
- What is it, baby?
Dad's on the phone.
He wants to talk to you.
- They moved into the new place.
- Okay.
- How's the new house?
- It's an apartment, Mom.
So are you taking them
Saturday night?
That sounds like a big deal.
Congratulations.
- Well, sure, sure.
- He's our fucking father.
- Baby, I...
- He's never with us!
No, not you.
You know, you're going digital on me?
Yeah. I'll talk to you later.
So we're not staying with him?
He gets to go to some black-tie event.
Hey. Something for NASA.
Says he's gonna try
to have brunch on Sunday.
You get out, you get out of here.
Terrific. Now he might as well
be on the fucking moon.
No, no. My mom will kill me.
- She smokes.
- No shit, the same brand.
No shit.
If you want it so bad.
Look what I got from the tattoo shop.
Let's do it right now.
Here. Sewing kit.
This is probably gonna hurt
worse than your tongue.
I don't give a shit, just do it.
Oh, fuck!
What the fuck did you do?
- Everything okay, Evie?
- Yeah, we just spilled a Coke, Mel.
Trace, it's cool
that you're not scared of needles.
We can go and get tattoos.
More piercings.
May I come in?
Sure, Mel.
I've got a surprise.
I sewed on the leopard fur.
The fur was thicker at Red Balls.
- These are tight, Mel.
- Thanks. It only cost 6 bucks.
Tracy, tomorrow you gotta sit down
and do all your homework.
Maybe you could go to Noel's.
- She called a couple of times, you know?
- I know, Mom. I know.
<i>Okay -</i>
Good night, my little beauties.
I love you, Mel.
Mom.
Don't go in my room without asking me
again. Those were my favorite jeans.
I don't go into your room
and screw with your stuff.
When have you ever seen me mess
with anything that was yours? Mom!
Fuck her.
Yo, Evie!
- You ready?
- I'm going to the park with KK.
Give me a sec, okay?
Go away!
What, do you wanna come?
- Yeah.
- It's just gonna be me and KK.
You know?
You ready?
Stop biting me!
I love you, Tracy.
Evie?
- Stick out on the sides.
- Are they real?
- Possums? Okay. When I...
- Well, excuse me.
Oh, hey. Grab some oatmeal.
- It's okay, I'm on a diet.
- No, you should put some...
...chocolate chips in it.
It's actually very good.
Come on, Tracy. You know you get
mean when you don't eat.
Fuck you.
Come on, Evie. Let's go.
Hey, Evie, could you just
give us a little second?
Yeah, sure.
Does Brooke have a boyfriend?
- No. She dumped him.
- When?
Last week or something.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. He's in Orlando.
- Now can I go to school?
- Yeah.
All of a sudden Medina
has a ghetto booty?
- I think she stuffs.
- That slut ain't got shit...
...compared to these
double cheeseburgers.
Shake it, don't break it, bitch.
Fuck her.
- Javi, you look hot.
- What up?
Hey, Marcus. Javi.
- Hey, Evie.
- Hey, what's up, Marcus?
Hey, Tracy. Can I holler at you?
Yeah.
I was wondering if maybe you
wanna go kick it sometime.
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay, well, can I have your number?
- Yeah.
- Here's my cell. We'll be hanging out.
- Straight. See you guys later.
'Bye.
Oh, God, he's so cool.
I don't want him to come over
and see Mason and the loser.
Let's all go to my place.
My aunt says only one friend
at a time.
- Come on, babe.
- Okay.
I'm sorry, Astrid.
- Let me call my mom. 'Fine:
- Dude, they say it's 2 feet overhead.
- Yeah? Good call.
Oh, my God. Please don't tell me
that they live here.
No, they're old news. She's my
cousin, not my mom. Got it?
- Don't tell them I like them.
- Hey, boys!
- My friend wants to suck your dick!
- Oh, my God.
That was so not cool.
- Here's my pad.
- Hey, babe.
- Tracy, meet the lovely Brooke LaLaine.
- Hello.
Hi. She's a cute one.
Oh, Tracy,
your mom has been calling.
- Honey, can you get me another beer?
- Yeah.
Evie?
It's okay.
- So you're a model?
- She's a model-slash-actress.
Slash-bartender who's about to be
late for work. What time is it?
- It's like 4:30 or 5.
- Oh, shit.
Hey, no more than one.
You got homework.
They were removing asbestos
from the locker room today, so...
...we got the whole gym period
to do our homework.
Yeah, baby.
I love you, Christina Ricci!
- Tracy?
- What-y?
You're going out with Javi!
Evie, goddamn it,
where': My other cutlet?
- Oh, shit.
- Incoming cutlet!
- Nice meeting you.
- Very nice meeting you too, princess.
Is that your phone?
Popular! Hello?
- It's Javi.
- Oh, my God!
Yeah, she's here.
You wanna talk to her?
Relax, breathe. Calm down.
Hey.
No, I'm not too busy. Can we
do something tonight if Ruben comes?
Yes!
Hello? Come over. Right now.
Okay, bye.
You get to make out with Javi!
You don't know how to kiss, do you?
Oh, no. Yes, I do. Me and Noel practiced
with Cruel Intentions like 50 times.
Right.
- So you want me to prove it, - What?
- Hell, no.
I barely even felt that.
Oh, well, see if you fucking
feel this one then!
Well, okay.
All right, honeys, I'm out of here.
Oh, and if Benny calls,
tell him I'll be down at Rene's.
- Don't do anything I wouldn't do!
- Your lighter sucks.
Okay, remember the part when Josh is
smoking a joint, the beer, and he's all...
- I don't remember that.
- I didn't either.
Did he do that same face too?
You jumped on me when that teacher
got a pencil stabbed through her hand.
- That wasn't even scary.
- Yeah, it was.
What is this shit, man?
Check this out.
Is it getting kind of hot in here,
or is it me?
We are so perfect for each other.
You know, if everybody married
someone from a different race...
...then in one generation
there would be no prejudice.
- So you had a good time?
- Yeah.
But it tasted kind of nasty.
What? We didn't go over that one.
Want anything special
from the market?
No, thanks, Mel.
I like everything you get.
Hey, Trace, do my back.
- Who's that?
- Luke. Or "Lifeguard Boy."
His parents moved away
and left him the house.
(He)', Luke!
Got any beer?
Luke, you are so lucky!
I want your house.
You know, I think I'm gonna call
some of my friends.
How about we make a Luke sandwich?
- How about you're jail bait?
- Yeah.
You know what?
Luke, you know I'll never tell.
Trace, would I tell?
No, because Ruben would kill you.
- Come on, Luke.
- No, no.
Danger. Danger, will Robinson.
- Luke, it's not illegal to kiss.
- Says who?
Tracy, come here.
Check out his white-boy ghetto lips.
- Try it. Come on.
- NO-
- Come on!
- It's Luke.
- So?
- Come on, you guys.
Go, girl.
Luke, where's your bong?
Right there.
Why don't you get back over here,
though, girl. Come here.
Feels good, huh, Luke?
You know you want it.
You know what?
You know what? This is...
why don't you guys get out of my
house. Get the fuck out.
- Stop. Just stop. Now get out. Please.
'shite.
- Just get out.
- What is wrong with you?
- Now, please.
- Get off me, you fucking pervert!
Please, just get out of my house.
Just go.
- Luke, chill out. We're leaving already.
- Get out of here.
- Hey, could you guys give me a hand?
- Mom, I'm not your fucking slave!
Shit.
Shit, my breath!
- Toothpaste, toothpaste.
- Where's the mouthwash?
Hey.
Hey, open this door now!
- What do you want, Mother?
- This is not how I raised you.
- I want you to be civil to me.
- I want you and your stupid boyfriend...
...to get out of my life!
What's he doing here?
- Have you been drinking?
- Of course. She's always fucking drinking!
- Right, Tracy?
- Like you never have!
- Hey, hey, come on.
- You guys!
- Hey, Kayla.
- Birdie, what's going on?
- Hey, - It's okay.
I thought we'd crash here for a couple
of days, just until my check comes in.
- Let me take that from you.
- I'm coming down with diphtheria.
Yeah, sure, just for a couple of days.
- Mason, can you find your sleeping bag?
- Yeah.
Why not open a hotel, Mom? You know,
you should get paid for all this.
Tracy, baby, this is just temporary.
- Where did all this stuff come from?
- Brooke bought it for me. Us.
Come on, Evie!
"Wanna bone?"
Nice.
What's the occasion?
She wanted to say thank you
for taking care of me.
- Baby, we have to have a real talk.
- Wanna go to the park?
- Mom, I have more homework to do.
- Yeah.
You should go to more meetings.
No, you don't understand. It's different
this time. She's starting to scare me.
I know. I know. I know.
Damn it. I know.
I just wanna make it stop.
You fucking hard-ass.
That's why you're my sponsor.
Okay, okay, okay.
I'm gonna try. I'm gonna try.
Okay, I'm gonna do it.
- Yeah, baby. Close your eyes.
- Oh, my God.
Close them. Close them. Oh, loving it.
Loving it. You are a gold queen.
Hey: Guys'
What the hell?
Watch his head.
- Look at that.
- Oh, my God!
Yeah. Zen chicken.
That's weird, right?
It doesn't even move.
Chickens are cool, aren't they?
Cool.
- Oh, Mom, no, I can't see that movie.
- Why?
Because it's a gross, bloody war movie,
and I'm a pacifist like Gandhi.
- Why don't we see the Jack Black movie?
- The Misadventures of Ezekial <i>Balls.</i>
It looks funny. It's a giant pig!
- I won't be seeing that.
- Come on. It's family night.
We'll see separate movies.
We'll meet here at 10:15.
Two for the pig movie and two
for the handsome fellow in the war.
- You are so awesome.
- Look, I've got popcorn...
...and butter
in a separate foil packet...
- ...for the little ones.
- Thanks, Mom.
- Okay.
- Thanks, Mel! I love you guys!
Love you.
I thought that was our popcorn.
Bye, Mom!
Later, Jack.
Come on, Mrs. Hooch.
Mothers, lock up your sons!
What's up, ladies?
How you guys doing tonight?
You guys having fun?
- I got my ass beat for the other night.
- Oh, yeah?
Hey, Javi, come spit that verse!
Oh, all right.
Why don't you go get us some sodas?
And you know what? Tell Conrad
to get down here on his break!
<i>Okay -</i>
Yeah, I just got mine pierced
the other day.
You stupid fucker!
Oh, sweetie. Back that ass up.
I'd like to see how that thong
looks on my bedroom floor.
- Too bad you'll never know.
- Tracy?
Oh, shit. God. Fuck it.
- Hey, Tracy. Here's your Cokes.
- I didn't pay for them anyway.
- You didn't have to with your fine ass.
- Fuck you.
- You seen Evie?
- No. She went to the candy store.
Want some?
- Easy!
- What the fuck is that?
It's my voodoo juice my friends made.
Hey, don't be back washing.
Wanna go find her?
Yeah.
You all right?
Tracy? Let's go. Come on.
Evie?
Evie?
Evie?
You all right?
- Wanna suck my cock, baby?
- No!
Evie!
Evie!
Hey! Hi!
Javi spilled Coke on his pants
and couldn't perform...
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Do you even know what time it is? Shit!
Hey.
Call me, baby.
Jeez, Mom, I can't help it
if the movie ran early.
- Bullshit, Tracy. We checked the theater.
- We got a drink at Starbucks.
- What's wrong with that?
- Where's the backpack?
I got you a keychain.
Hey. How was the movie?
Good.
Mom, I gotta talk to you. In private.
Okay. Come in the kitchen.
I'm making tea.
I'll help you.
Should we talk about how you
get stoned every night with Rafa?
She knows I smoke pot, Tracy.
Look at your pupils.
You're so fucking busted.
I'm gonna fucking...
- Jesus Christ! Goddamn it!
- Don't ever touch me again!
Go ahead! Hit me! Come on!
You'll go to jail, you fucking slut!
Don't you fucking call me a slut!
Mom! Mason just called me a slut!
- Melanie!
- Hey, stop, stop, stop! Stop it!
- Hey! Hey! Hey!
- Wait, wait! Stop it!
- Tracy, look at this shit!
- You know she didn't mean it.
Mom, don't touch me!
Don't touch my hair!
- She's out of control.
- Have you eaten anything today?
- Mom, stop with the food thing already!
- Fuck it.
You don't want me to cook
for you anymore? Fine.
- Then don't eat my food.
- Fine! I hate your nasty food anyway!
Great!
Then I can stop doing 12 haircuts
a day trying to pay for all this shit!
You think I wanna be here?
Fuck!
Damn it.
Goddamn dollar-fifty-a-square-foot floor!
Mel. Mel!
I told you we need a new floor.
Baby?
Mel? You all right?
Yeah, okay. I'm okay.
- You're okay.
- I'm okay. I need to call Sue.
Mom!
Don't worry about that, all right?
I'll take care of it.
Mom!
- Yeah, what is it?
- I can't even sleep in my own bed?
We can all sleep in here
if we just get this dog out.
- Yeah. Wake up, girl. 'Out:
Come on.
Oh, Jesus.
Something peed in your bed.
We'll change the sheets.
Take her.
- Mom, you're dealing with this!
- I'll take care of it.
You know what, Tracy?
You're gonna have to lay off of her.
Don't tell me what to do,
you fucking cokehead.
You're such a loser.
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
Arms up.
I can't do this with her anymore.
I can't. I can't.
I'm horrible.
Get in the shower, Mel.
This place is fucking with my head.
And, well, I wanna get loaded.
Go see Mario.
He'll read the Big Book
in that scratchy voice.
Okay, I know what to do.
Evie, I have to ask you something.
What?
What happened in the dressing room
with you and Javi?
Nothing, cokehead. He's your guy.
- Here.
- So, what's with the spoons?
- Just go like this.
- It's really cold.
- You're gonna call Evie's mom.
And then I'm just gonna talk to her
for a few minutes.
- She's just a kid, after all.
Mason, could you come in here
for a second, please?
Brooke does this every morning
and still has huge bags.
I wonder how much of this you have
to swallow for it to kill you.
This family needs some healing.
- Who bought you that wet suit?
- Fuck you.
Your mother's phone
has been disconnected.
She's not my mom, she's my cousin.
My mom was a crack whore.
Okay, everybody just take a deep breath.
Evie, honey, do you have a friend that
you could stay with for a few days?
I think this family
needs some alone time.
Cynthia, I'm the one that's here every
day trying to make the situation better.
Ask Mel.
Look, Mom, there's a huge swell,
and I gotta get pounded.
It's okay, baby. Just go.
- Phone!
- Wait, wait, wait. Hold on, hold on.
- Hello? It's Conrad.
- Hey, Spidey.
Evie, let's talk about you
for a minute, okay?
- I need to make sure...
- Are you a licensed therapist?
Bring the stuff
and I'll give you a surprise.
- She's done great things for me.
- She's a psychic.
Remember when
you tried to bring back Grandma...
...and Hampton ended up
humping your leg?
- Cynthia, I can handle this.
- Bye-bye.
I should... I should be
getting back to work.
- I could be selling houses right now.
- 10:30 at Nona's.
Cynthia can handle it, Mom.
You want me to model my new thong?
- Perfect for pooping on the go.
- What's that on your shirt?
None of your business.
- What is it?
- Don't worry about it.
- Let me see.
- What is it with you and poking me?
- I just wanna see what you've got there.
- Mom, stop!
What the hell is that?
- I'm talking to you.
- It's a bellybutton ring.
- Speak up, I can't hear you.
- It's a bellybutton ring.
How else can I say it?
I don't speak no other languages.
Oh, and you wanna know what that is?
That is a tongue ring.
- When did you do all this, baby?
- Oh, Mom, 2000 years ago.
I'm a mummy.
I was born 2000 years ago.
Tracy, Tracy, Tracy. I'm really starting
to lose it. Stop it, please.
No bra, no panties.
No bra, no panties.
- Stop it.
- No bra, no panties.
- You have to take her for a while.
- Mel, I can't.
- I need you to.
- I've been on the phone all morning...
- ...trying to get out of this thing.
- I need you to take her.
Are you hearing me here? I can't.
I will talk to her.
It'll be just fine. All right?
Where is she?
Is she in the back?
Hey, how you doing?
Listen, we gotta talk about something.
I gotta tell you upfront
that I can't take you this weekend.
I knew that you wouldn't take me.
Tracy. Look, baby.
You... You have gotta
cut me some slack, okay?
I am trying to kick ass at this new job.
I am trying to get you
and your mom more money. That's all...
Let me shut this thing off.
What's the problem?
What's going on?
Can I help?
Tracy, you gotta talk to me.
Dad, do you even remember
what the last thing we did together was?
- Dad, just answer the fucking thing.
- Look, this could be an emergency. I...
Let me take this. Yeah? No, I can't.
I'm with a client right now.
Look, Chris, I will call you
from the airport, okay? Fine.
Nice talking to you, Dad.
Baby, I'm not going anywhere, okay?
You know, fuck this work shit, okay?
I'm calling him right now
and telling him I'm not going...
Dad, just go, okay?
Really, you need this job.
Yeah, baby, I do need this job.
- Nice car.
- Yeah, it's just a silly business tool.
We're going surfing in two weeks, right?
San 0's? Okay.
She needs help, Dad.
Okay. Okay.
What is the problem?
Can somebody please just tell me,
what is the problem?
In a nutshell.
Wha...?
Mason, wait a..
Hey.
Nice car.
- Morning, Mom.
- Whoa. Hey. Hi.
Knocking's real good.
Mom, we have something
really important...
- ...that we need to talk about, okay?
- Okay.
I think that I would get along
a lot better with everybody...
...if Evie just lived with us.
Brooke will pay you to take me.
She won't be like
all the other freeloaders.
She was abused...
...by her uncle when she was 9.
Mel, he put things inside me.
And he pushed me into a fire.
'Mamas:
- You could really help me if I lived here.
You could maybe even save me.
Okay, I'll think about it.
You're so cool.
Bye,
why did you put me on the spot
in front of that poor little girl?
I can't reject someone
like that to her face.
I know, Mom.
- Come on, Tracy.
- Goodbye. I love you.
I got a C-plus. Moving up.
What'd you get?
Let's just say my mom isn't gonna
get a bumper sticker this year.
Oh, I wanna bleed more. Hit me!
Make an effort, bitch.
Tracy?
Tracy?
- Food's ready, ladies.
- Just a minute.
Tracy?
Get up, okay?
- We can't go out like this.
- Oh, shit.
Here.
- Her uncle got seven years.
- Look at you.
You're stretched to the limit.
Shit, you're stretched beyond the limit.
Kayla and I are sleeping in a tent?
She's been abused
by practically everyone...
...who was supposed to take
care of her. I have to help her.
No, Mom, come on,
you don't know that. I mean, Jesus.
How do we look, darling?
Guys, say hello to the butt.
- I wanna play. I wanna play.
- Okay.
- What happened to your lip?
- Nothing, Mom. I just bit it.
Is that my belt, Evie?
Yeah.
Do you have any film?
You want to take pictures of us?
No, Evie, I don't.
Okay, kids, this is the day. You guys
did a great job, these all look really...
What?
Oh, my God.
Wait. Today's the due date?
You guys could've called to remind me.
- We left you a bunch of messages.
- Not to mention a note on your locker.
Our phone's been disconnected
because we're having family problems.
My grandmother, she passed away.
Go to the counselor, Tracy.
She'll talk to your mom. Now.
Knock it off, you guys.
Fuck.
So you just wanna go
to the boardwalk and sell some shit?
I can't. I'm late for marine biology,
actually. We're doing a play.
And I'm a mermaid.
I can't even remember
how to spell "photographer."
Where are we going, Mel?
Brooke. Wow.
- I've been calling for two weeks.
- Sweetie, sorry.
Sorry, sorry. I just...
I didn't want you to see me like this.
They cut off my ears.
What?
They cut off my ears.
Okay, girls, please go out to the car.
Okay? Please. Please go out to the car.
I had that little kind of
turkey-neck thing, you know?
I mean, listen, I had a kid to support.
I mean, fuck.
You had... You had plastic surgery.
- Why, Brooke? You were so pretty.
- Evie knows what I'm talking about.
You know that little kind of flap thing
that was in the pictures?
Oh, my ears hurt so bad. Look.
- Was this, like, a standard procedure?
- Yeah, I guess.
I mean, you know, they had to tuck
the skin somewhere, I guess. It's just...
I didn't realize they'd have to do the
whole, you know, fucking crop circle.
Right.
So everything's okay, then?
Yeah.
- Sorry.
- That's okay.
Excuse me.
Oh, God, I'm a mess.
Beer.
- Can I get you a beer?
- No, that's okay.
We're gonna split.
So, Evie...
...we'll bring your suitcase over
later, okay?
So you're not gonna adopt me, Mel?
Evie, I mean...
...Brooke's back, so...
Hi.
Hey, Trace.
- Hey, girlies. Astrid, Medina.
- Hey, baby!
- Ladies.
- Let's go, ladies!
Go, Brian.
<i>Evie. Evie, that was hilarious, okay?
Now come pick me up.</i>
It's Tracy.
Evie, can you hear me?
- Mason, would you hurry up?
- Just a minute.
What the hell? Are you jacking off?
Hey, Tracy, I'm with a client.
Work mode.
Mom, I told you
that I was having a bad day.
- I can't wait till you move to Dad's.
- What the hell did you say?
Nothing. It's just something I heard
Mom and Dad talking about, okay?
Forget it.
Hang on a minute.
- Hey, Tracy.
- Okay, hang on.
- You's nasty. I heard that you got used.
- What? By who?
By Conrad on the stairs at Nona's party.
That never happened.
Believe whatever the fuck you want.
That's not what Evie said.
You fucking lying?
Bitch, you better not touch me.
- Stop!
- This shit ain't over.
Stop it! Hey, come back here.
You've made F's
on your last three tests.
You haven't turned in any homework.
On that basis alone, you're gonna fail.
You'll be held back in 7th grade.
What?
- They can hold me back?
- Yes, they can hold you back.
Tracy, your name was brought up
in Impact Group today.
Evie Zamora turned in your fake ID.
And there's the matter of cheating
in math class.
You were one of my
best students. Your poem...
...was one of the most
incredible I've ever read.
I'm sorry.
Hey, Tracy.
Your mom sent me to pick you up.
What's going on? I'm supposed
to be studying at Yumi's house.
I don't think so.
Come on, hop in.
It'll be okay.
Hey, Evie.
Brooke, you healed up great.
Sit down.
- I have to go to the bathroom.
- Leave your purse.
Fine.
Tracy.
What the hell?
They found my stash,
and I had to tell them.
I love you, okay?
You're my girl,
remember that. I love you.
Come on, let's go.
- Tracy...
- What?
None of that shit': Mine.
We found it.
What? Speak up, Mama,
because I can't hear you!
Do not talk to your mother like that.
She said, we found it
stashed around your bedroom...
...all your little hiding spots.
Jesus, Evie.
- I had to. You don't get it.
- Oh, no, I get it.
Who do you think you are
going in my room?
You're lucky I got there
before the cops did.
Hey, I'm just trying
to help you, sweetie.
How do you explain
$860 in your purse?
What do you expect me to say, Mom?
We jacked it, okay?
It's not like your broke ass
ever has any money to give me.
Mom, when Brady
went to the halfway house...
...what happened to our phone?
Our cable?
You didn't even know
how to pay the bills.
No wonder Dad didn't want to be with
you. You didn't even finish high school!
We don't have extra stuff, but we're
okay. You know we're doing okay.
You don't have to steal.
Mom, you knew what was going on
with all those clothes and shit.
- Christ, you're not that dumb, are you?
- I didn't know it went that far!
Oh, God.
We'll be moving up to Ojai,
so you won't be seeing Evie again.
Never. You're really cruel, Tracy.
I'm sure you can be a sweet kid
when you want to, but right now...
...you're a really bad influence.
I mean, you cheat, you lie, you steal.
Are you kidding? Where do you think
I learned all this shit from?
Tracy was playing Barbies
before she met Evie!
Did she teach you how
to beat the crap out of her?
I've seen the bruises.
- What the hell did you tell her, Evie?
- Come here. What about this?
- We were just goofing!
- Tracy didn't hit her.
- Yes, she did!
- I don't believe this! She hit me too!
- And look at this, Mel.
- Don't you dare. No...
- Take your hands off her.
- No!
- She cuts!
- Oh, God!
It's none of your business,
you fucking Frankenstein!
Oh, no, this child is my business,
you little cunt.
That's enough. You need to get out.
- Come on, Evie. Come on.
- Get out!
Who would want to be in this shithole
anyway? It fucking stinks in here, Mel!
Oh, no, Mom. Get off of me.
I hate you. Stop.
I love you and your brother
more than anything in the world.
I'll die for you, but I won't leave
you alone right now.
Mason said you wanted me to move in
with Dad. You don't want me.
You don't want me.
I want your dad to be in your life more.
I want you here with me.
You're my heart.
We'll make it right.
It can never be right.
- Get off me.
- No.
Get off. Mom, please.
Don't hold me. Don't! Stop.
Mom, don't. Don't.
No, no. Oh, God.
Stop. Stop.
Stop.
Don't.
Oh, God.
