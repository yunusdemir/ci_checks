She was always  against marriage.
Always, even as a child.
But she didn't get those ideas from us!
In life, you have to find a shoe that fits your foot.
Walk barefoot and you'll cut yourself or grow calloused.
The Talmud says:
He who does not marry is not a human being.
A great artist.
I always believed in her, from the time we met at Fine Arts.
I think there's an invisible thread uniting us.
The market's picking up now. We had a slump but I can't complain.
Mina?
Some people are emotionally unstable.
But there was somethinq between us right off.
Something... Something.
Put back the cafe scenes with the old man.
But tighten the editing.
Jeanne, did you send off that file about...
Mina Tannenbaum? We met when I was seven.
What could I tell you? It'd take too long.
Mina Tannenbaum?
I'm the right person to come to. She's my cousin.
I'm in charge of selling her paintings.
Boasting aside, it's going pretty well.
Here we are in her studio.
We can look at the paintings later.
It's 5 April 1958,
Mina Tannenbaum and Ethel Benegui
have just been born at Rothschild Hospital
Mina is 73 hours old. Ethel 8 hours,
All right, all right. Mama.
Sit down.
All right, I'll sit. I don't exist.
Make like I'm not here. Old women don't count, anyway.
Of course you count, Mama. What are you going on about?
Mina's mother had just realized she was cradling her mother-in-law.
Just a little one. one last one... before the next.
Should I peel you an apple. Daisy? It'll help get the chocolates down.
You know babies. if you don't eat. they eat you.
If you insist!
She finished me off. Understand, Georges? Finished me.
I don't want any more! Here ..
Who says good fames don't protect the newborn?
Aprils, 1963
Is it serious, Doctor?
Just a moment. Madam, please.
There. Mina. What do you see?
- A car. -Very good.
There?
A rabbit.
Perfect.
There?
You must see something, Mina.
I don't know if it's a glove or a hand.
What pretty glasses! Aren't you lucky!
You're very pretty, you know.
One hundred francs...
Come on, hurry up'
Four-Eyes!
Four-Eyes!
Go away, we don't wanna play with you.
We don't want to play with you, Four-Eyes.
Go away!
Mina looked up.
She saw the trees outlined clearly against the sky
So she told herself she lived in a world where trees-
are outlined clearly against the sky.
Mazel tov.
Lucky we have celebrations to get together.
How's school?
You look so sad in the corner. Gail.
Hey. come back with that tray.
Hello, Daisy. Mazel tov.
So. what were you saying about Miriam, Daisy?
Like I said, she went off with a goy
and her mother killed her pulled her by the hair,
and threw her out.
Mommy, what's that mean, "pull her by the hair"?
Stop spying.
Go and play.
And don't you ever marry a goy, or I'll kill you.
Can't you see I'm talking!
Go play with the children.
See what I mean? Children mean worries.
And a few worries mean more worries.
Come on. what's all this? A Bar Mitzvah's
for dancing.
We're gonna dance.
The boys ask the girls. Choose your partners.
In '68 every little girl dreamed of becoming a dancer
because of that TV show "The Happy Age"
-Hurry! -I don't wanna go!
to make our father and me ha
May 2. 1968
Be happy, go yourself!
Mina. if I don't control myself...
So don't control yourself.
No TV for a month.
I'll watch if I want.
I don't wanna go.
Come on Mama, come on.
All right, dear. here we are. Go on, now.
Okay, I'll go to your damn class.
I'll watch you go in
What did I tell you?
Weren't we supposed to meet on April 2nd, 1968
at 4:30 pm?
Look pal. Primo
it's May 2nd, not April 2nd.
Second stop trying to put a meaning into everything
It'll drive you crazy.
An encounter can be everything or nothing at all
And this is nothing at all!
My Ethel's a nothing?
You're new?
Drop dead.
Is something particularly funny, young ladies?
I see we have a comic recruit.
Come here.
Quiet!
We can all see you're being a clown because you have problems.
The new girl's crazy! See how she's dressed?
Let's open her bag.
Look! it's weird. Full of drawings.
Are you touching my things?
No, it was an accident!
... subsequently the scene of particularly violent confrontations.
The Sorbonne. closed like Nanterre after the first clashes
between students and police,
was the rallying point for thousands of demonstrators.
It quickly deteriorated
as students launched paving stones and bolts at riot police.
Police shields and clubs went up.
What were the causes of the rioting?
- What you doing? - Sitting. Do you mind?
No, it's okay.
Don't like dance?
Why should I? I don't care what others say.
All girls dance.
Well, I don't.
You left this.
You're returning it?
- I'll keep it, then. - No, you won't,
But I gave it back! So give it to me.
Why take it?
But I gave it back! Can I keep it?
- I'll sell it to you. - How much?

What's your offer?
Twenty francs?
You crazy? Know what this is?
What is it?
A copy of a Gainsborough. His daughters.
But I've made one whisper in the other's ear,

I'd rather give it to you.
Like I said! So why argue? Give it to me!
April 7. 1974
What are you thinking about?
Same thing as you.
And you?
You're dense!
Still, when you think about it!
Yeah, when you think about it!
It's really disgusting.
Really disgusting,
And for the dozenth time they went over
the last night's events.
Shit!
- I've been waiting an hour! -I can't go! It's no good.
Look at my clothes!
- They're fine. Really pretty. - You sure?
What can I say? She's 25 pounds overweight.
And that tee-shirt doesn't help!
it's really gross.
With that apple on it!
- Do I look ridiculous? - You're a knockout.
- A knockout, really? - And me?
What about you? Well, you're fine!
With that stringy hair
and glasses she looks like John Lennon.
Your look's really in. You'll knock 'em dead,
Ethel, it's here.
She always supports me. and I lie to her
I'm really disgusting
Wow! An apple! Great!
I brought dessert!
Funny as usual.
Shit, Mina. I have the same jacket.
I almost put it on.
Stop twisting the knife. Because I wore it.
Still the same, you two. Come on in.
Bye!
It was a great party. Thanks.
-You okay? -Yeah.
I'm gonna stick my head in the oven.
Why do I go? I hate parties, anyway.
Hurry up. We'll miss the last metro.
- What now? - Walk home.
We're not walking. it'll take half an hour.
- Got another idea? - No, but I'm not walking.
No metro, no cars, nothing! Not even a lighter!
He didn't speak to me of love
He found words of love too absurd
He said to me. "I want you"
He'd been to the movies to see
"The Game Of Love"
Deep in an improvised bed
I discovered in wonder
A beautiful sky
He'd just turned eighteen
which made him proud
And sure of himself
And as he put his clothes on
I felt vanquished
I was alone again...
You can be such a jerk!
That song's stupid.
It isn't. You just don't get it.
The party was lousy. Not even one Gainsbourg song.
One thing I know is... I'm ugly.
You're not ugly.
I am. I can see how guys are with me.
You don't see a thing.
That's true. But anyway...
What about me?
Guys who look at me are forty, gross, and like 'em fat.
You're out of your mind.
For a girl, ugliness is a curse of nature.
If I was Brigitte Bardot, I might not be a feminist.
So now you've got to be Bardot not to be a feminist?
That's great, there's only one in a lifetime.
Anyway, how do you know she's not?
To be a female is to be a prey. So you might as well be one.
How can you talk like that?
Chicks always side with the guys.
Just great!
Maybe we're wrong and crazy to say that!
Mom was sold for six camels and she's happy.
Your mother, happy? That's news.
So do like her. Get on with it.
Stop sneering!
I'm not sneering.
- What's that, then? - Nothing! But I know what I know.
You always have to judge people!
I'm not judging people. It sucks, that's all.
Okay, I'm going!
A few days after that argument
Mina crossed the Seine to enroll in a drawing course.
Are you going to answer or what? Telephone!
Coming!
Fuck!
Oh, Elizabeth. How are you?
Yes... I'm free.
German pen pals?
Sure. We'll take them around town.
- Come by at 8 o'clock. - Wait a minute!
Cover the receiver. Germans coming here?
- Elizabeth's pen pals. - Not in my house.
In fact, I'd better meet you downstairs at eight.
Okay?
See you then.
And why can't they come up?
- You know why. - No, I don't know!
You make a scene about everything! You don't know them!
Maybe they're nice. Do you even know how old they are?
-I don't care!  - Of course you can't answer that.
Tell her to be quiet.
She gets on my nerves,  the little bitch!
She does it on purpose. I won't have any Germans in here!
Henry, do something. Make her leave!
That'll do for now.
Stop upsetting your mother.
- Can't we even talk? - Stop it. Get out.
You're such assholes. I hate you!
You're such assholes.I hate you!
Tiny head, big fat tush.
When you fart, you go whoosh!
Silly!
In the center: painter, child and nude woman.
On the right: Thought, Love, the Public.
On the left: Society and its depravities.
Perfectly Balzac! Totally Balzacian! Stunning.
The artist calls forth his century
in his studio, and places a nude woman at its center.
You always come at the right time.
That's what I call violence! It's daring!
It's provocative, an example of courage in art.
The new girl. A comment?
Is that the silence of someone thinking
or someone who doesn't think?
Are you thinking something, Miss?
As you're not, repeat after me:
"It's an example of courage in art!"
There's no courage in putting a naked woman in a clothed crowd.
I see.
Have you ever been asked to model, Miss?
Of course not. You haven't the figure for it.
Women are so jealous of each other.
What are you doing?
I'm leaving.
You're staying. What's this?
You can't stand the slightest remark? You're brave as a rabbit.
Okay, class over. Dismissed.
Anyone want to treat me to a coffee?
What if I pay? Anyone for a coffee with me?  Sure Francois, I'll volunteer.

You can't imagine the effect it had on me!
It was like a bullet to the heart.
What I mean is, uhh...
What do you think?
Would he look at me like that otherwise?
I don't know. You can never be sure.
Why do you say that?
Some things are so obvious!
The same things always happen to us at the same time.
Like yesterday. I cut English class and took a walk.
I didn't want to hear her story.
I wanted to talk for hours about how he looked at me.
I thought she was just changing the subject, and had nothing to say.
And then.
"Those moments shall never return by my own fault!"
"At a moment so extraordinary."
"so interesting for me, I wasn't aware of it."
"Indeed, I was born with a dull, gloomy nature."
I scared you. Sorry.
Let's see!
"The Red and the Black."
Like it?
Yeah, it's great. Have you read it?
I interrupted you at a crucial moment.
More or less.
Sorry. I'll let you read, then.
What are you doing?
Looking at the sky.
I like doing that.
Don't you?
In fact, one day I'll take off for a place
where's there's plenty of sky and trees.
It's true, you know, you can't live without nature.
- Wow! He said that to you? - Yeah!
- That's really strange! - You think so?
Yeah. So what'd you say?
That I loved nature and wanted to be a farmer.
I don't know, I hate the country.
Really?
What interests you?
I like to watch people around me.
You watch people.
It can be pretty exhausting.
- It's raining. - You never know
what they're thinking, but they think plenty.
Freud says
if you really look at them, you know their thoughts.
That kills me.
It's raining hard.
Shit! It's raining!
Bye. See you. maybe.
Going down? You'll get soaked!
You're better off this way.
It started to rain. We ran hand in hand up the steps
He plays the piano. Can you believe that?
We can wait here till it lets up.
Come here. You'll get drenched there.
No, I'm fine here.
I must look like a drowned rat. I better split.
"O the gentle sound of rain on the earth
"and the rooftops. O the song of the rain
"for a heart in pain." Here.
Thanks. I think I oughta go...
Look, I play piano in a restaurant. We could...
You play piano?
That's fantastic.
You look funny with your hair wet.
I think I'd better go.
No, wait. Don't go. Listen... Take my card and come by.
-I have to go. - Saturday. I'll expect you.
Okay, thanks. I really have to go.
Funny! Boy, she really is funny!
Rub, rub.
Afraid you'll make a hole with the cloth?
Ethel...
You remember Miriam?
You know, your cousin.
The one who ran off with a goy.
They're not together anymore.
Simon and Henrietta wouldn't let her back home.
Their own daughter? You think that's normal?
Yes, I think it's normal.
What do you expect?
We don't do things like that.
Like it or not,  we don't have a choice.
I don't want to go!
Don't say that. He invited you.
That's just it. It'll look like I couldn't wait.
Not at all. There are two of us. It's different.
He's at the disadvantage.
- I'm gonna see what he's like. - Don't!
Well?
- Come on! - You saw him?
Come on. It's getting late.
Okay. Anyway, I don't care.
He's there!
He's older than God!
Dummy! That's not him.
You scared me.
But he's a good pianist.
Talented.
Yes, maybe.
What'll you have, ladies?
A salade nicoise.
Make it two.
House wine?
No, water.
Carbonated, natural?
- No, carbonated. - Tap.
- Tap water. - And some carbonated.
Do you know if Didier's here tonight?
Don't know him. What's he like?
Tall with brown hair. He told us he plays piano here.
Oh, Dodo! That's Dodo.
They alternate. They work it out between them.
But it's not him tonight.
He won't be in tonight?
Maybe. Sometimes he just drops in.
Want to leave a message?
No, forget it.
Poor kid. She never had any luck.
But I'd have been surprised. if it had worked out.
Look, anything could've happened
Sickness, a death in the family.
Sure, a death! He obviously doesn't give a shit.
I've got to face up to it. Can we go home now?
You see, when he said...
If you're in the neighborhood, come see me.
Sure, when?
I don't know. Friday. Not Friday... Saturday.
Okay, Saturday. Hey. your handkerchief!
Saturday it is, then!
I can still see those little eyes. Much more cynical, in fact.
-You didn't tell it like that. -I did!
- You've re-arranged it. - Me? No way!
That's how you told it.
You never listen!
That's because you change your story every time...
Hello.
Hi. How are you?
So. what do you think?
About what?
His saying "hello" to everyone and "hi" to me.
-Well, so what? - So...
Hi!
So, obviously there's a nuance.
If he said hello to everyone and hi to me.
The cooler you come on, the more you have to hide, right?
The girl's a moron!
Yeah, well, I don't know. Basically, he said hi.
Miss Tannenbaum. what do you think about when you draw a foot?
I don't know.
It should resemble a foot, right?
What does a foot look like?
More or less like what I'm drawing, right?
More or less...
Look at me.
Put your pencil down.
Don't look down.
When you can focus on something for eight hours
and not think of yourself,
then maybe you'll manage to draw something with feeling.
Good technique, but continue like this,
and you'll wind up a copyist.
I hope you realize he just gave you a compliment.
Oh, yeah?
I don't like feet, but yours have feeling.
Feeling... it's just an exercise...
What time is it?
Quarter after five.
Thanks... You like the course?
Want to go for a coffee?
- Hi, Francois. Want to see the show?
No. Want a coffee?
Sorry, I can't. Got an appointment
But Mina just said she'd like one.
See you.
How about that coffee?
This is awful What can we talk about?
There are millions of things . Drugs. Vietnam, the Holocaust...
Why am I here? What do people usually talk about
Useless things. That's me. Useless.
Great coffee here.
Could I have a cigarette?

I'm empty and full of despair
I feel like my cheeks are all fat
and red.
How'd you find the course?
I could say that
Good. Interesting.
I mean had you heard about it?
No, I found it by chance. Why?
No reason. So you live around here?
No, not at all.
Well, I'd heard about Fumacher.
Supposed to be crazy,
but he's amusing.
And a dynamite lecturer.
Got another cigarette?
You smoke an awful lot.
Last one for today.
The last until the next one.
That's it. make romantic eyes at him through your glasses.
He's sure to go for that.
Look at that. Heavy, eh?
I was sure you'd like it.
I didn't say I liked it.
But, yeah, I do.
But, yeah. I do.
Incredible, huh?
I'll never be able to do anything like that.
I don't know why I persist,
I only have a grain of talent.
Shit! What false humility.
What do you mean? Not everyone is like you.
Come on, the guy's full of himself.
Yeah, you must be right.
A year ago
I bet a friend I'd burn all my paintings
if he didn't make it with a girl he loved.
And?
And? I burned them all.
Two months later, he lost interest in her.
Then she wanted to get it on, but he didn't.
 What were your paintings like?
Hi, Francois, can I sit down?
Elsa, Mina.
Were you at the T Rex concert last night?
We waited for you.
What were you up to?
I'm gonna get some air, buy a paper.
Say, Mina, you've known him for long?
No, not very long.
He grabs anything that moves.
- Why are you telling me? - No reason.
I have to go.
What about Francois?
I've got to go... I just realized...
I'm realy late.
  Well, goodbye, Mina.
Mina's life was now nothing more than a...
Shit! They're not there!
How stupid of me! She's in drawing class.
I love you, Mina... Since the day I grazed your arm.
I love you, too. I love you so much.
I can't resist you.
I love you...
Something the matter, Mina?
No.
I thought you could change your way of seeing things. But you can't.
Mina felt abandoned
But she couldn't give up her dream of love...
She despaired even more thinking about the hopes she had nourished.
See you Tuesday.
He never stops talking about you!
Look at what I did to myself.
Why go to the hairdresser's just now?
Just to make improvements.
Improve what? What can we do now?
Wait, maybe if we pat this down on the sides.
No, that won't do at all. You'll have to wait.
There's no other choice.
I can't go to class, then?
Maybe not.
It's a disaster!
A disaster!
Really, you're sure I shouldn't go tomorrow?
I'll miss three weeks, before it grows back!
- Hi. - Hi, how are you?
Okay.
This is Didier.
Could I sit down a second?
Well... we're talking.
I won't disturb you, then. You never came to hear me.
Me? I never came? Are you kidding?
No. I never came. I didn't because I... I couldn't.
I didn't have time. Did I miss something?
No, you didn't miss anything. I mean...
It's just a bar, not a concert hall.
Drop in, see for yourself.
I'll grade you.
Okay then, come by. I'll buy you both a drink.
No, I can't.
Gotta finish my book. I'm not thirsty.
Actually...
Meeting twice by chance can't just be chance.
Come on.
Well, all right. I'll come then
See you tomorrow.
See you tomorrow.
Francois.
Yeah. I was 17 and flat broke.
I won a Conservatory prize.
But I didn't feel like studying,
or working, you know.
Then I heard they needed a piano player in a club near my flat.
I took the gig.
3 More like luck.
Good, yeah. You like it?
Sure, I do. Yes and no, kind of.
Once you get behind a piano, you start to play, to sing.
It's cool. You see folks like you.
Ethel was tormented by her nose!
So far he'd only seen her full-face
Once he'd seen her profile. he'd change his mind for sure.
So she'd been walking in profile. I mean, facing him.
- What d'you wanna hear? - Don't know.
What's your seduction music?
You think I seduce girls, just like that?
You don't get it.
Don't get mad.
I'm not mad.
Just sad.
In fact, I thought...
Forget it. Here...
Hey, wait. I didn't mean anything.
I was joking. It wasn't that at all.
I think we've got something special, no?
I want you... I want you.
Got anything to drink?
Ethel, you want an ice cube?
- Why'd you do that? - I'm too fat
Seeing him again?
I couldn't. I wouldn't dare. It's over.
Why? You've gotta try!
No, I wouldn't dare. I was too humiliated.
Same with me. I'm sure he already forgot me.
You're crazy. He'll be worried.
He'll crystallize Crystallization, that's Stendhal.
Next time it'll be just fine.
What d'you mean, crystallize?
Crystallizing is thinking hard about someone
you haven't seen in a while and thinking: I'm crystallizing.
You keep the image.
You see it in a little corner of your mind all the time.
Crystallized!
Like a star. He looks even better.
Anybody there?
Hi, how are you?
No, I'm not sick.
I have to see you.
In a half hour.
Not here, I can't. My parents are here.
Who is it?
Downstairs, then. I'll be right over.
Shit, it's Francois I can't see him.
But you made a date.
He can't see me like this. You go.
You're crazy! Why me?
I can't go like this!
I always have to do what you want.
Wear a hat.
You're Francois?
Mina can't come out. She's sick.
She just told me she was okay.
No... that's not it.
It's her mother who's sick.
She told me that she'd call you.
If she wants to call...
If she wants to see me, she should call me tonight.
I hope she can, because she's going on a trip.
I am too. Can you give her a message?
Well, so long.
While Mina waited for her hair to grow back,
Ethel thought things over
and the more she thought..
the more she figured they'd done the wrong thing
She suddenly decided to go see Didier again.
I love you.
Stop it.
I can't. I'm an animal.
That girl looks weird.
It's the neighbor.
A few days later, Mina called Francois
and found out he'd moved down south.
Those were the two great romances of their teens.
What's on your mind?
Same thing as you. And you?
You're dense!
Still, when you think about it...
It's disgusting.
Really disgusting.
April 15. 1989
It's Mina's opening today.
Actually, she's one of four former Fine Arts students
exhibiting for ten days in a Left Bank gallery.
But Where's Mina?
There she is, with the man with the moustache.
How stupid of me!
That's where I first heard of you.
I'm on the jury for the final round.
That's nice.
Well, you're the first to see my latest work.
- I like it a lot. Jeanne? - Lovely!
I don't want to speak too soon, but let me say... Good luck.
See you.
What'd he say?
Shut up!
What?
Why not broadcast it? He's watching me!
So?
So I've just met the jury member who's gonna fuck me over.
Really? He's on the jury?
That's great! That asshole never talks to anybody.
That's Serge. He studied with Mina at Fine Arts.
They've been together for four years now.
Before him, Mina lived three years with that one, back there.
Mina's been collecting guys for a while now.
Me, I'm going through a drought these days.
I don't know why, but no matter. Life goes on.
But it's not that bad. I'm in no hurry...
Seen Naschich?
He's here? No!
He's been badmouthing everyone for the past hour.
Now he's talking to Ethel.
Ethel? Where are they?
There.
What's she doing with that pig?
Hi!
Pass by the office. I'll give you a tryout.
Evening or morning tryout?
You know, it's nonstop with us.
I'll take you to lunch.
You'll be okay... I eat like an anorexic.
A fine mind in a fine body. Perfect for a trainee.
See you Tuesday.
Tuesday for sure.
I'm sorry about the stain.
Great show!
- Like it? - Oh, yeah.
They all love you here.
Cut it out!
You've got talent, brains, beauty.
Will you talk to me when you're famous?
Being your friend opens doors. It always has.
What were you doing with that scum?
- What scum? - Naschich.
You don't think he's scum?
He might get me work on his paper.
Got that in ten minutes?
Just as a trainee. I'd only start with painting reviews.
I never thought you cared about painting.
I've always been interested in painting.
I see.
I gotta go. Gerard's waiting. We've been fighting all week.
In any event, I'll call you.
You're one of three people I can stand in this world.
And the other two?
Very funny!
Excuse me.
It's nothing.
- So, happy with the show? - Yes.
Yes really or yes polite?
What am I supposed to say?
Aggressive as usual.
I'm not aggressive. I'm normal.
Okay, you're not aggressive.
Want my opinion on the show?
It's not bad.
Although I'm not crazy about the large paintings.
I can't picture them in my gallery.
You don't like them...
No, it's not your style.
What do you mean by the word
"style"?
Style! It's obvious, isn't it?
Don't like criticism?
Sure.
As long as the criticism makes sense.
Fine.
We'll talk again when you think I make sense.
But... that series of small paintings...
I rather like them.
For five years now
Ethel's been living in a tiny fiat
with a goy she hides from her family.
So who's this?
It's my teddy bear.
Hello Teddy... hi Teddy.
Stop! I don't feel like laughing.
You hurt my ear.
What's the matter? Not another drama. What is it?
Tell me!
What am I gonna do with my life?
Everything's okay then. I'm gonna take a shower.
I want to be immortal. make my mark.
How can I become famous?
What if I wrote the Story of my life?
"It was raining that day on the rotunda..."
Where'd you hide the laundry basket?
What's the matter?
I don't know. To hell with your laundry basket.
- Only that counts. - "That"? Be precise. Explain.
That. What's this?
And this.
And what's this and this... and this?
Oh, Jews! I forgot, it's forbidden.
Golf and tennis are so much more advanced.
What about the hunt?
If your family's the target, I'm ready.
- How can you say that? - And you?
Don't touch the intercom.
I forgot only Jews could touch the intercom here.
Mama? What is it?
Will you let me in?
Sure, right away.
It's Mama.
-Out! -I don't believe this!
Hey Mister, is this building sanitary?
I don't know, Ma'am. I'm no specialist.
Nor is my daughter.
Can you help me carry the bags?
Here!
That's why you live in a rotten building.
Wait, wait...
Here, thank you.
What is this place? I'll never get used to it.
You shouldn't just drop in.
I brought you some food. Look how skinny you are.
Oh. my God!
What's that?
The picture of the rabbi.
Remember?
Enough!
Find yourself a Jewish husband. We'll get you a nice flat.
Damn your husband and flat!
Watch how you talk to your mother!
- Papa's away on business. - So? You're fifty years old.
Come sleep over at the house.
I'll never sleep at the house again.
Be nice! I can't sleep all alone.
- Please... - Be nice.
Stop it!
Get me a drink. I feel sick.
-Please. -Come on.
Stop it, please. It's almost funny.
Come on, baby.
I'm not a baby. Can't you see?
I'm not a baby.
I'm not a baby!
Understand?
I'm not a baby. Now lay off!
You win. Happy now?
It's always the same. I've had enough!
I don't want to see you ever again!
Lay off me, please.
What did I do? I'm sick.
Shit!
I'm not sure.
Cut it out. It was a hit.
How do you know?
I saw them. They were happy.
I don't think so.
No, you're wrong. Come on, open the door.
What about Jacques Dana?
I don't know. The guy's weird.
Hurry up. Maybe it's the Beaubourg curator.
It's me. Do you have Devas' number?
I want to turn up with a scoop. Like an interview.
Shit, hold on.
Yeah, he's a very famous painter.
Hold on.
It's 40 44 42 69.
He doesn't know me, you know.
Really? Well, if I have any other ideas, I'll call you.
I want to show you something.
What is it?
My latest painting. Like it?
Your latest painting?
I'll never let you into my studio again!
You rip off all my ideas!
What did I rip off?
Colors, shapes, everything!
Okay, so I ripped off the colors.
What are you doing?
It was a gift, but too bad. I'll keep it.
Want to sign it?
I apologize.
It was a gift?
I'm sorry.
I take it all back. I like it.
Give it to me.
It's dumb. You could do it yourself.
Stop! Back at the gallery, with the director...
You told her you'd taught me everything.
So... give it to me.
For me, it's fantastic that we met and can work together.
Together, we can't go wrong.
Don't you think?
What does she want now?
It's Jacques. Can you hear me?
I decided to take three paintings. Drop by.
Tomorrow. three o'clock.
Goodnight.
Who was it?
Jacques.
He wants three paintings.
But with him. until the ink's dried...
That's true...
Why rejoice when you can worry?
He only wants three, it's not much.
If he really liked them, he'd take... five.
Pack of Kents. please.
It's our little lady! Ten-francs-eighty for you.
The same lovely eyes.
Coffee with milk, right?
You win.
Service with heart. Who can refuse a pretty girl?
So we don't change anything. I'll call you.
- How's it going. Fine. And you?
Good. Sit down.
I'll take three paintings from the brown series.
What are the conditions?
60% for me, 40% for you, per sale.
As usual.
No advance?
Better come down to earth.
Okay... And the contract?
I'll send it. Are you working on anything?
Sure. Why'd you ask?
I'm doing a show in six months.
I'm looking for young talent.
Won't you sit down?
I'd rather stand,
Why do I bother furnishing my office with chairs?
So that people can get up.
Think you'll have enough for a show by then?
You're not going to pay anything?
Want a commitment on air?
Not on air. on me.
Propose some things. We'll see.
Some things,
I love your lexical precision.
Victoria? What the hell are you doing?
I'm waiting for your paintings.
You're three weeks late.
That's right... You're a pain.
I love that girl but she's a pain.
That's what you get when you mix business with sex,
That's what you get
"when you mix business with sex."
- Think it's a come-on? - Maybe he means it.
You're preaching to a convert. I never mix work with sex.
That so? Well, you're right.
I'll send you the contract. We'll keep in touch,
Work well.
Aren't you going to kiss me?
Only from the 5th to the 17th.
I'm not changing. I've got someone after.
Mr. Devas? This is Ethel Benegui.
I'm a young journalist and I just love your work.
I'd love to do an interview with you..
Ah, it's you,
I pictured you as a blond on the phone.
That's a weird welcome.
There's worse. When I got there he said. "We may not get along.
"I hate young painters."
What young painters?
Right... Well...
I'd better tell you. It's nothing, really.
Mr. Devas? This is Mina Tannenbaum.
You pretended to be me?
Go on.
One, two...
Just a second...
What would you like to know?
just want to do something lively, very relaxed...
Well, go on.
If you could take one painting to a desert island, which would it be?
None.
Why?
I don't see why I should bring a painting to an island.
Where's your show?
24 rue de Seine.
What do you like in my painting?
Good question.
What do you like in it?
I don't like my painting. I like to paint.
It's the product of the free exercise of my imagination.
It obeys no preconceived rules.
I'm sorry.
You mustn't be.
This never happened to me before.
Ever before!
Isn't she fantastic?
She got an interview with Devas. Nice, huh?
How? He never gives interviews.
"My life has its secrets..."
I managed, that's all.
Ready?
I'm dying to hear this.
So what happens? Forward, rewind... Nothing
I couldn't understand it.
Nothing "Shit! Shit! Shit!"
I tried the whole tape
Every button. Nothing.
And then I said, "Oh, shit!"
I don't get it.
The tape's blank.
But I recorded it all.
Nothing here.
Typical! The dial was in this position.
If you need me, I'm in 102.
Well, I'm off.
I'll tell Philippe.
He'll love it!
- Why are you crying? - Because... nothing.
Tell me. Why?
Isn't it obvious?
You think it's tragic?
It happened to Naschich his first time out.
He had no film in his camera. That's why he's delighted.
But how could I?
The thing I like
is that you got through to the guy. You've got nerve!
I try.
-You're hired.  -What?
I've got an assignment for you.
"What men appreciate most in women."
- Interested? - It's great!
Why the silence?
The subject stinks.
Really? Why?
Tell me you don't know.
Make me laugh!
We say we're alike but we're not.
Oh, yeah, we're not?
In fact, we're different.
And?
And more different than similar.
Why'd you use my name?
- I told you! - Don't ever do that again.
Get off my back! You've got no hold on me anymore.
I don't want to have one.
You've succeeded.
Now you show your true colors.
That's right...
Our friendship's beginning to weigh on me.
No, I'll pay.
I'm broke, but I can still pay the bill.
It's all said then.
Yeah, it's all said.
I really helped out a lot at the time.
Isn't that what family's for?
You okay, Mina?
Do you want anything?
Ethel didn't come until ten days later.
She was caught up in her new job.
Mina. old girl.
How are you doing?
You okay?
-I can't shake hands. - Let me kiss you.
I came as soon as I could.
I brought you this.
You'd better open it.
Gorgeous! Put them there
so I can see them.
When do you get out?
In two weeks
In two weeks
In two weeks
In two weeks
You're blond now?
Only idiots never change.
I've changed too.
Want to know about the aftereffects?
What'd you mean?
The accident aftereffects.
Don't dramatize.
I'm disfigured.
Oh, come on!
I'm disfigured...
Got a light, please?
- Got a light, beauty? -I love to light your fire.
When will you put it out? How about a date?
To talk salary?
You're getting a swollen head over one article.
Stay modest. It suits you better.
For you that means exploited and consenting.
Good idea. How about consenting to my executive privileges?
- So, do we have a date? - Can we get to work?
Sorry to disturb you... Ethel, your topic.
Well, I was thinking of a piece on the new singles.
Another sex story.
- But soft-core. - Soft-core sociology!
The talk is always below the belt. They can't be serious.
- Did you get the assignment? - Of course.
- But Naschich is in control.
He takes me for a little girl. I can't stand it.
Aren't you playing it that way?
I can't believe you said that!
I'm telling you how I feel and you...
Sorry, I misunderstood.
It's a tough business. That's the problem.
Anyway. How's your work going?
It's coming along... I've done five already.
- They're superb. - There'll be ten.
I mean it. Why don't you call Dana?
I don't know. He left a message on the machine last week.
He only sold one of my three paintings.
I told him I had an accident.
He was nice. He invited me to dinner.
- I said no. -Why?
I didn't fancy it.
Mina! Go see him.
Promise you'll go see him?
Mina thought she could no longer feel love for anyone.
Mina thought she was afraid of being alone.
Mina thought she didn't even know if love existed.
A few weeks later Mina made an appointment at Dana's gallery.
Pack of Marlboros, please.
Ten centimes short!
Pack of Stuyvesants, please.
Taking a stroll, honey?
- Buy you a drink? - No, thanks.
C'mon
- C'mon, I'm buying. - I don't want to.
Look at you! Well, I don't want to either.
Think I'd have a drink with that?
Tomorrow then, La Coupole...
You're twenty minutes late.
Sorry, I got stuck in traffic.
- Are you all right? - I'm fine.
You've been working? We only sold one painting.
So? Was this a test for you?
What's your diagnosis? Not commercial?
I didn't say that. But...
Whatever.
May be the way they're sold.
Blame me if you like.
And the show?
You haven't shown me anything.
Well, here you are.
A portfolio. That's progress.
It's not at all what I expected.
I said I wanted small paintings.
- You never said that. -I did!
He was so cold!
He never spoke to me that way before. He used to smile
I had no chance.
Yeah, but look how you talked back.
But I didn't really speak to him that way.
I'm just embroidering. I didn't speak that way.
Forget about their size.
What do you think?
Listen, Mina.
Let's just say big paintings aren't selling now.
Keep working. I can't promise anything.
It has nothing to do with big or small.
Small ones are better.
You should go into real estate!
I'm being polite with you, so be polite with me.
Okay, I'll be polite.
So long.
Keep me informed.
Stephanie. Coffee, please...
Got a Coke?
You finish the TV interview?
Yeah. I'm editing now.
Yes.
You have beautiful eyes.
What'd you want?
I'd like you to do copies for me.
I pay well. Eight hundred francs a painting.
Easy stuff - Renoir, Monet... Do it fast. It's good practice.
No, thanks.
You're not interested?
- I'll leave my card. - If you want.
It's a shame. I can tell good copyists by their eyes.
Strange guy.
So you're going to Lyon tomorrow?
No. Paul called to say Mama's had a relapse.
I'm going to the hospital.
Deborah can cook. Best spend Shabbat with us.
Stand still if you don't want a slap!
Here's Ethel. Mind what you say to her.
So, how is she?
As well as can be expected.
Why all these glum faces? It's dumb.
No, not here.
Shit! Can't even smoke in this hole.
The doctors are very pessimistic.
Like the last time. But they'll cure her.
No, it's too advanced. They can't do anything.
I can't believe that.
Okay, okay.
Hello, Mama.
So it's you.
You want to watch TV?
But "Santa Barbara" is on.
My show's on at the end of the month.
Aren't you glad?
Ethel thought that under such circumstances.
the soul rose to undreamt-of heights. But no!
Her mother chose to give her a hard time, as usual.
Where are your brothers?
Don't worry. They're in the hall. I'm here.
- What are they doing? - Having a coffee.
Coffee?
Look how you're dressed.
Like I always am.
Your hair's all burnt.
It's disgusting!
You want me to go? I'll go.
What am I to do with you?
You're old!
Who'd be interested in you now?
Nobody. Satisfied?
If only I knew you were going to marry a Jew. But no...
You made me sick.
You've always hurt me. Always, hear me?
You're dying and you're still hurting me!
You're just a mean woman!
Look at this.
No, the matrimonial columns.
"Young Jewess, pretty, rich, intelligent, seeks Jewish husband.'
So? You want to do the same?
No, not the same. It's my ad.
You wrote that?
Sure!
Have you gone nuts?
My mother wants me married.
Not when she's about to...
I show up with my husband, maybe she'll recover.
Just because you're married?
She's such a nutcase, you never know. It happens.
And Gerard?
I dropped him.
- Dropped Gerard? - Yeah. It's over.
Don't get angry at this.
But that stuff with your mother is just an excuse.
You want this.
Ridiculous!
The thing is. I have no choice.
What's wrong?
Shit! Jacques Dana just walked in. What's he doing here?
- He mustn't see me. - Should I hide you?
- Should I? - Too late.
Hi, Mina. What are you doing here?
Having dinner with my friend.
Haven't you met?
I'll introduce you. Ethel Benegui... Jacques Dana.
I'll sit down for a sec while I wait.
-All right? -And you?
You a painter?
- What, then? - I'm looking for a husband.
- Is that a job? - Finding a Jewish one is.
I'm serious. I put an ad in the paper.
There's this situation...
Word of mouth can work too.
Know any decent young guys. with a good job.
good-looking, Jewish, who want to get married?
I'm really in a hurry.
A husband or a flat? I've got one...
I'm not kidding, really.
I'm serious.
How will you choose from the guys who answer?
I'm doing a casting call.
I'm meeting them in a cafe. The one I like best, I marry.
Casting Jewish husbands. A modern idea.
Why the rush? Awaiting a happy event?
My mother's dying.
Oh, I'm sorry.
My mother likes men who have a good job.
- And you? - For me, it's not important.
I see! Your pal's a loony.
Because...
Which cafe will it be?
The Albatross.
I know it! When?
Tomorrow, between five and seven.
Fine. See you tomorrow.
Good evening.
See you tomorrow.
I didn't do anything!
I have a big apartment, 1,000 sq. ft. My fabric shop is doing great.
I celebrate all the Jewish holidays. I want my wife to stay at home.
All right.
I love Mozart, movies. books and deep relationships.
Fine.
Why exactly did you come?
To cop some ass.

I have minor problems...
Problems with...
Well... problems.
It's your ad, Ethel?
You answer them now?
We can be marrying cousins.
As in the saying: It's good to marry in your country
Better in your village, but best in your family.
No. I'm not Jewish. Is that a problem?
No, thanks.
A woman who chews gum and asks questions is not for me.
Yes, I'm a doctor. You look impressed.
What could I say?
You're attractive.
Actually, I have the kosher butcher shop.
I see you walk by every day.
In fact. I'm really thrilled.
If it's possible... That'd work out fine for me.
I'll call you.
You'll call me when?
I don't know. I'll just call.
- Maybe I should call you? - No, I'll call you.
You'll call? For sure? I'll be waiting.
See you soon.
The Doctor
So, what have you got? The last one wasn't much good.
- What do you want? -I came for the exam.
Frankly, I'm your best bet.
I have all the right prerequisites.
Bearing, big turnover, sense of family,
?and I'm observant. We can marry in temple.
And right away.
-I hate dawdling. - What's this all about?
I'm the ideal husband. Your mother will like me.
Why go through all this to get married?
I'm 34. I have to marry some day. Why not you?
Let's see...
The perfect Jewish-wife profile.
I love bleached blondes. Acerbic and cheeky.
So, is it a deal?
You want to see my accounts?
You'll flip and I'll worry you're marrying my money.
You're unbelievable.
I don't know...
You insist?
Well, if you insist like that, okay.
I don't believe it! You really did that?
Yes, why? -It'll make Mama happy.
Stop lying!
I'm not lying.
Why have you always wanted what I had?
You never had him.
- You know I love him. - You don't love anyone.
Bitch!
It's not for your mother.
He never cared. You lose nothing.
I lose nothing. Call that nothing?
A friendship like between Montaigne and la Boetie. You're a monster!
You always have to judge people.
I'm sick of being on trial.
You can't do everything,
Where's it say that? Wat's your own law?
Don't you do whatever suits you?
Like with Serge?
I do my best.
Pretending to love out of self-interest. Very noble.
Don't preach.
If Dana had said yes, you'd gladly have dropped Serge.
Don't preach.
What do you know about people?
And you?
Why are you doing this to me?
What did I ever do to you?
Why choose him?
It's none of your business!
If you marry him, I'll never see you again!
Never? That's blackmail, Mina-style!
The hell with it!
Your influence is over! Basta!
What's this influence you keep talking about?
You're no model for me anymore.  Understand?
You never were a model for me.
- Get out of my sight! - I'm going!
I won't send an announcement!
I'll receive it with pleasure! About your mother's death.
You bitch!
I want the drawing I gave you when we met.
I'll put it in the mail.
Anything to add?
Goodbye, Mina.
I want to move. This place is too big.
- Papa's sure to come home. - Even for two, it's too big.
You've always lived in Paris. What are you doing?
I like the suburbs. Why do you criticize me?
I'm not criticizing.
Won't it feel strange never to come back?
Twenty years mean nothing?
Well, that's perfect.
Mina had blindly believed everything
her parents had told her as a child.
They said they were her parents. but they were strangers.
Mina, you know, I'm on TV next Thursday.
That book I'm in, about children of Holocaust victims...
I'm on the panel. You'll watch?
I've got to go...
You'll call?
- When? - Soon.
Go see your father. He complains you never come.
I'll go.
I'll see to Ethel.
Should I make coffee?
It's done. But you can serve it.
Here are some sedatives. They'll numb you.
Did you put orange essence in it?
I'll get some.
Does Mina know?
Why doesn't she bring the orange essence?
Are you the coroner?
 Now that time has gone by.
it is our duty to speak out so the world won't forget.
I agree. I never passed this burden onto my children.
No one can say I've complained.
But what have they given me?
We were unhappy. so unhappy.
But my daughter... Look..
She has every reason to be happy.
Turn it toward the camera.
She's unmarried, has no position.
Can you understand?
We were unhappy. but they refuse to be happy.
That's right.
Same with me. My son went off somewhere...
Mr. Reinhart?
Are you still looking for copyists?
Two years went by.
Mina lived off the copies she did
She was still painting and hadn't seen Ethel again.
April 2. 1991
I left you a message.
I'm working.
I just wanted to know...
what you're doing tonight.
Okay..
We'll get in touch then...
Next week:
Sure, see you.
Next week.
Hi You're at the right number but I'm not here
Leave a short message after the beep. Make me happy...
Excuse me...
Can I leave my keys with you for the gas man?
Of course.
Sure it's no bother?
Thanks a lot. You working?
Goodbye. Thanks.
And forever start again
As if I hadn't all that pain
I've seen so much. so much, so much
In my head there's such a mad refrain
I swore I wouldn't fail for it again
I've seen too much. too much, too much
But every time. I tried to turn the page
I'd find myself stuck back on the stage...
This is my wife, Muriel.
So you're married. Congratulations.
What are you up to?
Not much.
How's that not much?
I'm still painting.
I read that you're doing pretty well.
Not bad. I can't complain.
I have a show next month. I'm working like mad.
That's good.
We ought to get together.
Still at the same address?
I'll send you an invitation.
I'd like to know what you're doing.
She's a terrific painter.
Seen Ethel?
She lives with Gerard and has a kid.
I didn't know.
I've got to go. I'm late.
Keep in touch.
I think of you a lot.
Mina felt a sudden urge to go see her father.
You're talking nonsense!
I'd planned to go that day.
That's not true!  You decided just then.
He'll be pleased to see you.
it's been a while.
I've been pretty busy. How is he?
All right. He's fairly calm now.
Mr. Tannenbaum, it's your daughter.
Daddy...
Madam?
How are you?
Tiny head,
big fat tush.
When you fart, you go whoosh!
Hush, Mr. Tannenbaum!
Leave.
Tiny head, big fat tush. When you fart, you go whoosh!
Calm down.
Is Ethel in?
She'll be back at five. Would you like to leave a message?
No, that's all right. Goodbye.
So Mina decided to wait for Ethel to come home.
What are you up to?
Still asking the same dumb questions!
You never called.
You never called, either.
That's true but... I didn't have this.
This is my daughter.
She's beautiful.
Don't give her the evil eye!
All right. I'm sorry.
She's so ugly. Monstrous, unspeakable.
Don't! You haven't changed.
Neither have you.
So you wouldn't have called?
You know, it's not...
It was you who didn't want to see me again.
That's possible.
Have time for coffee?
I can't. Sorry.
If you want, we can get together Saturday.
Saturday?
I'm inviting myself over, okay?
See you Saturday, then.
I tried to replace you. but I didn't succeed.
Life was suddenly wonderful and Mina felt talented.
Yes, life was easy.
You just had to know how to take it.
What do you mean, you're not coming!
-I want to stay in Paris. - But you promised!
Shit! You pull this on me every time!
Holidays bore me.
How'd you know? We never go anywhere.
You said you'd take ten days off.
We never see each other.
- That's true. - It's not your work?
Then, come with me.
Want to have a sulking girl on your back? I hate skiing.
And I hate girls who won't take vacations with me.
What about Mina?
We'll leave her with the nanny.
Ah, the nanny...
Hello. Mina. It's me.
I can't make it Saturday. I'll call back.
I tidied up my hair
And put some make-up on my eyes
And that made him laugh
And as he moved closer to me
I would have done anything
To seduce him
He'd just turned eighteen
And that was the key
To his victory
He didn't speak to me of love
He found words of love too absurd
He said to me: "I want you"
He'd been to the movies to see
"The Game of Love"
Deep in an improvised bed
I discovered in in wonder
A beautiful sky
He'd just turned eighteen
Which made him proud
And sure of himself
And as he put his clothes on
I felt vanquished
I was alone again
I wanted to hold on to him
But I let him go
Without a word...
The earth had dried around the grave
when Ethel phoned eleven days later.
It's Ethel. Are you there?
Listen. I'm back in Paris.
I really want to see you. Lots of hugs and kisses.
