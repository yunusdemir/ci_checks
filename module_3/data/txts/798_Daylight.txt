- Thanks for coming. Nice to see you.
- Why are we slouching?
I don't have that much time. The gates are
gonna be open between 11:00 and midnight.
I got my guy on the gate.
You go right through, no fuss, no muss.
- What are you worrying for?
- Let me worry!
Where's the stuff, huh?
That's a lot of toxic waste you got.
You got a problem, baby.
No, you got!
Just get it to Jersey and dump it!
Dumping it's a federal rap.
I'm taking all the chances.
That's why we pay you!
All right, come on. Where's the money?
Yo, the money.
Come on, come on, come on, come on!
What is this, the tip? This the tip?
You deal with the E.P.A.
See what it costs you!
Make sure you're there by 11:00.
What are you guys, crazy?
You wanna blow up the goddamn joint?
You drive carefully.
I don't want you to hit anybody.
Oh, here we go, into the tunnel of love.
All right, get over, get over.
Who's got the cards?
We collected 32,563 tolls
between the first and second rock.
Grace!
Grace, are you in there? Come back. Grace!
I found this under my bed.
You think you could be
a little less discreet?
I found this under my bed.
I'll see you after work.
Listen, when I return this,
I have something to tell you.
If it is good news, why not get it now
and have a completely good day?
As opposed to one filled
with apprehension and tension,
which can lead to other related
physical disorders and high anxiety.
No, I will tell you later, Island Girl.
- Tell me now.
- No. I'll tell you tonight.
Hey, Frankie,
how's your load?
Mostly in my shorts.
- I need a pit stop, bad.
- Just hold it. We're behind schedule.
- Need some help with that bag?
- Maybe you need some other kind of help.
Stuck-up bitch!
Ugh.
"Dear Mr. Thompson. " Thanks a lot.
"Thank you for your submission.
"Regretfully, at this time, we... "
Are laughing our asses off that
you even wasted the stamps
by sending us your play.
Hi, it's Maddy. I'm out. The machine is in.
Maddy, hi. It's Kimberly.
I have this important audition,
and I told Claudio you'd take my shift today.
I did it for you when you went to Bermuda.
Bye!
Got ya!
Hi, it's Maddy. I'm out. The machine is in.
Maddy, it's David.
I feel really bad
about the way things ended up
and I want you to give me
three more months, and I...
I promise I'll tell her.
Honey, you've got to cut the cake!
- I'll be right in.
Oh!
It's George's birthday,
and we're having a party,
and call me on Monday.
I... I... I love you.
Oh! Oh!
Go!
Traffic report says the bridge
is backed up to Westchester.
Forget the bridge.
Take one of the tunnels.
The "Territory: Beyond. "
It's still out there.
The "Territory: Beyond. " It's still out there.
- The "Territory: Beyond. "
- It's still out there.
The "Territory: Beyond. " It's still out there.
It's exhausting being me.
- Now the question is, what do we do with it?
Sales are down 12%.
Broadening our marketing target
from inner-city youth
to the more affluent off-road vehicle group...
I know that.
Give me something I don't know.
We're gonna have to stack some G.R.P.'s
with this commercial,
no matter where we run it.
- Now, the test results are maxing out...
- Speak English, Elliot.
We wanna put it on the Super Bowl,
first quarter.
Super Bowl.
- That's a whole pile of money.
- It's time to gamble, Roy.
It's not like we have any choice.
We'll buy 60 in the first quarter and
we'll do a cut-down 30 in the second.
You wanna gamble? Let's gamble.
Jonno, let's go.
- How are we doing on time?
- Traffic's a mess.
- But if we take the tunnel, we'll just make it.
- Let's take the tunnel.
Come on, Cooper. Okay. It's all over.
- We're gonna have a nice day in the city.
- Good boy.
Whatever good that specialist does
is undone by the long drive in.
He hates riding in the car.
It puts him off for days.
We're not taking him back
to that quack in Colts Neck.
Look, Eleanor, he's perfectly capable.
We don't even know
what's wrong with the dog.
Who knows him best?
Me or a complete stranger?
- Let's go this way.
- All right.
You know what I'd like to do?
I'd like to go to Rumpelmayer's.
- Cooper loves their cherry-vanilla.
- That's a brilliant idea.
What'd they get you for, man?
They got me for stealing.
What you up here for?
Cheating on your expense account?
No, I sell cellular phones
with cloned numbers.
So, how much you get from the register?
- A hundred, two hundred.
- You use a gun?
No, I used my looks. Of course I used a gun!
I sell five to ten phones
a week for $500 apiece.
I don't use a gun. Can you multiply?
I ain't stupid, man. I know my math.
If you so smart, why you up in here?
I guess I shouldn't have bought
that BMW for cash, huh?
That's ridiculous!
He's the top man in his field.
I wouldn't dismiss him lightly.
Dr. O'Corr, it says here
you got a 5:30 flight out of Newark,
but you want to stop off
at St. Vincent's first, right?
- That's right.
- Lewis has been working...
- That's gonna be tight.
- There's a $50 tip in it for you if you make it.
Then again, miracles do happen.
Right, Doc?
This sucks. I wanna go back
and skate at Rockefeller Center.
Hey, how about somebody else
does something they enjoy?
You wanna visit old school friends,
leave me out of it.
A family vacation is about
staying with the family.
Let's not talk about staying anywhere, okay?
- Hey, asshole!
- Hey!
- What do you want? What do you want?
- Hold still!
- No, not that, please!
- Shut up!
I got it! Come on. Let's go!
Come on! Come on!
Good afternoon.
36 channels and nothing's on.
Norman, one of these days
you're gonna surprise me with a new line.
Hey! What?
"Stop now!
You are being tracked by Electroguard. "
What the hell is Electroguard?
The guy's a goddamn genius.
Right into the tunnel.
I'll call Jersey.
"This tunnel was drawn up
by Edward Trammel in 1918
"on a napkin in a Manhattan tavern.
"Work on the tunnel began in 1921,
"employing thousands
of Irish immigrants nicknamed 'Sandhogs. '
"The tunnel, which runs under 24 feet
of riverbed and 72 feet of water... "
Hey, Dad, how many vacations
did you take Linda on?
Ashley, that's enough!
Honey, listen. Linda's history.
We're a family again. That's all that counts.
Christ!
What the hell is that?
Oh, we got a live one here.
Get a crew ready.
All Jersey units,
requesting north tube roadblock.
Black Cadillac now passing through
station seven.
I want you, putz!
What'd we get? Come on.
What'd we get?
What's in there?
Oh, that's a big one!
Move it, jerk!
- Oh!
- You stupid bitch! Pick them up!
- Oh, look what you did!
- Shit!
Now it's your fault!
Heidi, it's helicopter skiing.
Think of it as a cordless chairlift.
Breaker, breaker!
We got a smoker! We got a smoker!
Up yours, buddy!
Start spreadin' the news
I'm leavin' tonight
I'm up to here
with all your shit
New York, New York
Pass him, man!
- Ass!
- Take them!
- Get off my leg!
- I can't!
No!
Jesus Christ!
Here I am in the tunnel.
You're doctors! Come on!
Get down! Get down! Somebody
get him down! Get him on the ground!
Down!
Roll! Roll! Roll! Roll!
Roll!
Get over here!
I got him!
- We're gonna need some C-collars!
- Shit!
Let me see that arm. You're gonna be okay.
Keep going.
There's emergency workers that way.
My father, he's trapped in the car!
I can't get him out! There's blood
everywhere! Can you help him out?
Help!
- We're coming for you. Don't worry about it.
Look at me. Look at me.
I'm gonna try to move you on the
count of three. I want you to help me out.
Okay, one, two...
- What's your name?
- Susan.
- It'll be okay.
- He's severed an artery.
I'm gonna tie this off, and I want you
to hold it as tight as you can.
- You got that?
- Yeah.
- All right, how is he?
- He's dead.
I got a second-degree burn over here.
Get to it.
You, I've got an arterial bleeder
that needs an I.V.
- What are you still doing here?
- I thought you were a cab driver.
I am a driver. Come on. Move!
- Give me a B.P. cuff.
- Sure, I got it!
Latura.
Jesus Christ. Latura!
Weller, right?
Get the hell out of here
before somebody sees you!
- Was it a bomb?
- Accident, something about a toxic dump.
What's the status on the Jersey side?
Oh, man, it's sealed up tight.
- It's a wipeout clear up to the tollbooths.
- Where's the chief?
Standing in front of me,
as far as I'm concerned.
I'm talking about the new chief.
The dispatcher said Mr. California's
headed for the mid-river passage.
- Mid-river?
- Yeah.
Hey, Latura, watch your back.
George! George, come in, please!
Are you there? This is Grace. George!
Oh, God, please be there.
George, come in.
George, are you there? George!
Can anybody hear me out there?
Come back.
We got a toxic fire.
It's burning toward the New Jersey side.
Can anybody hear me?
The ventilation system doesn't seem
to be pulling the smoke through.
Is anybody out there? Come back!
The New Jersey side
has completely collapsed!
Oh, God, Jesus!
Oh, God, we got fatalities down here!
Can anybody hear me?
Hey, you can't go in there!
No, no, no!
We're working the mid-river!
We got some wormholes here.
We'll find a way through.
- It will work in the mid-river!
- Thompson needs you!
- What?
- Thompson!
- I'll be with you in a second.
- Okay.
What's the ratio? All right.
Frank, you got any hope
on the New Jersey side?
Fifty-yard cave-in, minimum.
Whatever's burning in there
is toxic as Trenton. They got samples.
Demo! Demo!
Come on, people, speak to me!
Give me another reading, Bob.
I would if I had time,
but we're running out of it.
If you wanna buy some time,
you got to blow the tunnel shut.
- What are you doing here, Kit?
- You're not part of this.
I know that, but just listen to me.
We ran a terrorist hypothetical in '94.
The only way to fix the fire
is to blow the roof in
and seal the survivors from the fumes.
Where I come from, we don't blow up
a tunnel that's already been blown up.
- Chief wants to go through mid-river.
- No, wait a minute.
Frank, you don't have to
rationalize my actions to this guy!
I know you know yourjob,
but we did a simulation.
You'll all be dead before you get through.
I know you ran a drill in '94, but right now
you're not running a goddamn thing.
Copy that.
- You're right. I just wanna help.
- You don't get it, do you?
You don't work here anymore.
You understand that?
Wilson, if I could just talk...
Come on, Kit. He's gonna have you arrested!
You got to blow the tunnel shut.
Talk to him.
You owe me that, Frank. Talk to him.
Your attention, please.
We've decided to evacuate the south tube.
Please collect your valuables, lock your cars
and proceed in an orderly fashion
back to New Jersey.
What do you got?
Sorry, Chief. It's blocked about 20 feet in.
That structure's so shaky,
I wouldn't even risk a firecracker.
What about hydraulics?
We brace up as we go.
It can't be done!
The person who says it can't be done
is always interrupted
by the one who just did it!
Feed him the line!
Wilson!
Jesus Christ! Wilson!
Watch the metal. It's hot.
What are you doing? Ashley, no, this way.
No, no, no, Ashley,
you don't have to take pictures now.
- Ashley, look at me. Look, honey.
- It's okay.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
- Hey! Hey!
- What's happened?
I don't know. You're alive.
I'm gonna go on up through the tunnel.
Stay here with your family so I'll know
where you are when I come back.
- How do we get out of here?
- It's sealed at both ends.
Jonno?
Jonno?
Oh, shit!
Officer, over here.
- Hey!
- You raise anybody on that walkie?
Nothing but static. But you got a phone.
- $2000. It doesn't even work in here.
- "Territory: Beyond. "
- Man, I know you.
- Roy Nord.
George Tyrell. I got a pair of your shoes.
- Good, good. You like them?
- Yeah, they're great!
I wear them on Saturdays on my day off.
Bet you wish it was Saturday now, huh?
What are we gonna do?
Is there a way out of this mess?
There was a passage to the south tunnel
about a half mile back.
You check it out?
Of course I checked it out! It's all collapsed.
Well, think I'll take a look.
I just told you it was collapsed, man.
You'd be wasting your time.
It's all blocked in. There's no way out!
George, I was born six weeks premature.
My own mother couldn't keep me in.
Eleanor.
Oh, my God!
Are you people okay?
Yes, we're fine. We're fine.
Thank you for asking.
- How do you get out of here?
- I'm still trying to get information.
- Cooper.
- Who's Cooper? What's he look like?
There he is! He's all right.
No, no, no, darling. Come on. I'll get him.
Lady, get to the front of the bus!
The key is in the ignition.
Okay.
Hey, come on! You got to break it!
Hey, hurry up!
Hurry up!
Come on, come on! Hurry up!
- Help!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Get the key over here!
- I'm gonna try to find you some help.
Help? You are help! You are our help!
No, no, I'm just me.
The key's in the ignition!
Lady, lady, the keys!
The keys are in the ignition!
Hurry up! Come on!
Come on, lady, open up.
- That one right there! Right there!
- Go, go, go!
Did it! Hurry up! All right, man!
- You okay? You all right?
- My hero!
Thanks, lady.
What about him?
That boy having a crack attack.
You might as well leave him alone.
- Come on, help me.
- Yo, help yourself, lady! I'm telling you...
No, I'm telling you!
We are not leaving him here!
Okay, what's your name?
Mikey.
I'm like... Like scared, okay?
Yeah, I know, Mikey, I'm scared too,
but I'd feel so much better
if you were out here with me.
No, no, no, no, no!
Okay, okay.
Hey, Mikey.
Okay.
Hey, Mikey, you think we're pretty?
Yeah. So?
Wouldn't you rather be out there with
a couple of pretty girls than in here?
Oh, God!
Oh, shit! Hey, yo, Mikey!
We are all scared!
Now get your crack-sucking
skinny ass out that window!
- Now!
- Okay! Okay!
Okay. Okay.
You got to get noisy with these kids!
Hey, girl, you listen to me!
Jump now! Jump!
Come on, now. Get up!
Let's get you out of here.
That's gas under the bus!
Lady, get the hell out of there!
You take care of her.
I don't want any trouble out of you.
No trouble, man.
Baby, are you in there?
I need you to cut the power.
How do I say "cut the power"?
Cut the power.
Lightning, what do you do?
You get under a tree. No shit!
You get back in the car.
Right? 'Cause, 'cause,
'cause tires are rubber.
The what?
What are you doing?
What are you doing? No, wait!
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- This is it.
No! Wait a minute!
Oh, my God!
Cut the power. Cut the power.
Cut the power.
Is anybody watching these monitors?
Oh, my God! Norman!
Norman, it's George! He's alive!
Cut the power, baby!
Down here! Move! Down here! Yes!
- Mikey, go!
Something must be done!
- No, you're not doing it.
- Live! Live!
Come on, baby, cut the power!
- You got to cut the power.
- That would shut down the exhaust fans.
- Those fans are on a separate system.
- Hey, who the hell are you?
- Please, go!
- Wait, lady!
Mikey, go!
Just go, Mikey!
Oh, don't splash! Don't splash!
If you don't cut the power now,
that woman's dead.
- Go!
- Jump!
Cut the goddamn power!
Jump!
Cut the god...
- Yes! Yes!
- You did it.
Now, who the hell are you?
I did a terrorist hypothetical here in '94.
Yeah, Latura. You were canned in '95.
You're back with the
Emergency Medical Service?
Not exactly. How's the monoxide level?
You've got no authority to come in here!
No, but I've crawled through
every part of that structure
and I might be of use, so how's the air?
It's exchanging at a rate
of a million cubic feet an hour.
That's one-twentieth normal,
and it's getting worse!
Great, it's here.
Look at this thing.
When they glued this together,
they were still fighting World War One.
Okay, anyway,
here's the north tube, south tube,
river, the riverbed, and here's the tunnel.
A rectangle set inside each tube.
What's this? I don't recognize this.
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's...
The sandhogs worked 36-hour shifts
building this thing.
They had bunk rooms there, chapels,
kitchens... They had everything.
But it was all sealed off
in the renovation of '72.
Hey, Frank.
Did Wilson give an estimate
when he'd get to the mid-river passage?
Nothing that he can share, Kit.
We had another collapse.
Mr. California got pancaked.
So what are we looking at?
We don't know the stress points
in the mid-river.
We can't risk any explosives.
- It's all got to be done by hand.
- That's gonna take forever.
If another shaft don't give,
10, 12 hours, minimum.
- How long's the air gonna hold?
- Three hours, max.
All right, Frank,
here's what I think we ought to do.
I think we got to cork it up and
seal off the survivors from the fumes
until you can dig out the mid-river passage.
Frank, are you the acting chief or what?
- Yeah, I'm the acting chief.
- So why don't you act?
What are you trying to do, nothing?
So you'll be held blameless
in case you have to testify later on?
Don't pull that on me, Kit.
That's past history.
I had to take a chance. Now you do.
I was in the same situation as you.
There's nothing to think about.
Frank, it's three hours.
There's nothing to think about.
Frank, it's three hours.
You wanna go in, Kit?
Give me clearance.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
That tunnel is sealed from both ends.
I mean, the mid-river here
is hanging, like pick-up sticks.
Now, what the hell's the way in, huh?
Here.
This is Engine Seven,
E.T.A. about five minutes.
There are four of those.
We can shut them down for
two-and-a-half minutes.
Each?
Total. They're revved all the way up to
compensate for the damaged exhaust shaft.
When we shut them down,
it'll severely cut their oxygen.
When the level gets too low, the computer
automatically kicks the fans back on.
There's no override,
and there's no second shutdown!
- That's a safety feature.
- Anything else I should know?
There are more problems.
You don't come out above the roadway,
you come out under it.
Norman, what's the combined force
of all the fans?
- About 160 miles an hour.
- Great.
- Frank, where's the demo team?
- On the way!
Listen up, please.
I wanna go over a couple of things.
- You got tape in that camera?
- Yeah.
Get over there, start shooting.
World's gonna wanna know how we did this.
- New York City: the Territory Beyond!
- It's still out there!
Are you saying
you've found a way out of here?
Not yet. If you wanna get your hopes up,
go ahead.
A little hope never hurt anybody.
I will tell you that this passage,
which George tells me leads to
the south tunnel, has some wormholes.
I'm gonna go in and see if they add up
to a way out. So if you pray, pray.
And if you don't,
it might be a good time to take it up.
I promise you this, though... Miss?
- Huh?
- Right here.
- All the way.
- Okay.
- You got me?
- Yeah.
I promise you this.
If there is a way out, I'll find it.
Okay, hold on to that.
We're gonna make it.
- I'll be back soon.
- Yes, sir, we'll be waiting!
Listen, I'm gonna make one last sweep
of this tunnel, just in case he's right.
You keep trying to get somebody on
the other end of this thing. Take it.
Hello?
Need a refresher on that Semtex procedure?
- Set, wire, contact, run like hell.
- That's pretty much it, Chief.
Can anyone hear me?
I hear you. Frank, got them!
You can hear me?
George! George!
Okay, now, talk to me.
How many people are left alive down there?
There's maybe a dozen,
and we're in the middle of the tunnel
and there's a man who thinks
he knows the way out.
- How?
- Something about a mid-river passage.
No, no, no, no. Listen to me.
Tell them not to go in there. Tell them
we're coming down. Can you do that?
- I can't hear you.
- Can you do that?
- Hello!
- We lost them. Come on, Frank.
You got two-and-a-half minutes.
The fans are timed logarithmically.
Fan one kicks on after one minute,
the remaining three
in sub-15 second intervals.
- You follow me?
- I got it.
There's a guy down there
named George Tyrell.
You tell him I want my bracelet back.
Ready to shut down.
Kit, what I did,
I did for the good of the department.
It wasn't personal.
He was your brother, Frank.
It doesn't get more personal.
I was angry. I'm sorry.
Hey, don't apologize. You make me feel like
you don't think I'm coming back.
You're probably right.
You're probably right.
- Let's do it!
- Norman, now!
Fan one down, fan two down,
fan three down, fan four coming down.
All fans down!
Go, Latura, go.
It's not stopping!
It's not slowing down, Grace!
Hit the brake!
There are no brakes!
It's going on momentum!
You've got to stop it!
Frank!
Pull against it! Pull! Pull!
You got it! It's stubborn!
- I got it!
- Just a little bit more!
You got it! Take it out!
Hello? Can you hear me?
- Yeah, I hear you.
- Hello?
- How are you doing?
- I'm all right.
I just thought you should know
that the man has gone through.
Really? Where?
He's... Hello?
I've seen worse.
Oh, we're saved!
Did you guys stop for coffee?
- It's a rescue team! We're out!
- Where are the rest?
- There is no rest!
- You're joking.
Aw, come on, man!
- He can't be the only one.
There has to be some more!
Are some more coming or what?
Shit!
Tell me this is not happening.
Are we gonna get out?
- Oh, man, this can't be right!
- Where's the team?
He's it? You're it?
- You are it?
- Yeah, I'm it.
- You're the woman with the walkie-talkie?
- Yeah.
I thought I was clear.
No one was supposed to go in there.
- Excuse me, it was a lousy connection!
- How many are in there?
- Bitch, he's talking to me!
- Who are you?
My name's Latura. Now, who's in there?
There's one man in there,
and it's Roy Nord himself.
That shaft's unstable. We got to get him.
What you up to, man? I'm in charge!
If you want to be in charge, fine,
but that shaft's been compromised.
Anybody trying to get through,
that whole thing's gonna come down.
It's not exactly safe in here, either!
We can't even breathe, man!
We got to get out of here!
I know you've been through hell,
but I'm just asking you to be patient
a little bit longer and just trust me, okay?
We'll go out the same way you came in.
- That's not possible.
- If you made it, we can make it.
Just give us a chance, man!
The fans are giving us air.
Shut them down, we're dead.
That's it. That's a fact.
That won't work. Neither will this.
- Roy's on top of it.
- Roy's gonna be under it.
Now let me do what I got to do, all right?
I told you, I'm in charge here!
I'm in charge! You understand me?
Let him go, now!
Hello? Serena?
Serena, Roy. Actually, no.
We ran into a little problem on the way
to the airport. Yeah, listen.
Before we get cut off,
I'm gonna be leading some survivors
up through this ventilating shaft.
Hold the plane at Teterboro
and I'll do press in Denver.
Tell them I'll have some videotape.
No, no, Jonno didn't make it.
Yeah. Listen, I got to go.
- Why don't you take this?
- Just keep it.
- Take it, man!
- Try to get somebody on it.
The battery's dead! What's the point?
Don't give me any trouble!
Trouble, man?
- We're just standing here, Steven.
- We don't know if it's safe.
- We can't just go in there.
- According to who?
Get that out of my face, please!
- Hey, where's he going?
- Hey!
Get back here! Get back here!
Hey, you all heard what the man said!
I heard Mr. Nord, and I believe what he said!
- Women and children first.
- You done this before, man?
She's a child, and he needs that tape.
I don't know any more than you know!
Nord?
Nord? Oh, there you are.
Nord, you're a tough man to find.
My name is Latura, with E.M.S.
You got to come down now.
That sounds like an order, Mr. Latura.
You wanna give me an order?
Call my "800" number.
No, no, seriously, listen to me.
You and I are gonna
crawl out of here together,
so why don't you just come down
real slow-like, okay?
There's no way through.
This shaft is like a house of cards.
If it collapses, they're gonna
be mopping you up for a month.
It's not going to collapse.
How do I know that?
You don't achieve what I have without an
instinct for the torque of a given situation.
If you think I'm gonna start
second-guessing myself
because of some gutless paramedic,
you'd better get a reality check.
- Start sending those people in here.
Nord!
- Stay there!
- Get me out of here! I'm ready to go!
Stay! That's it.
Don't move, please.
Nord, I hope you make it.
Get out of here!
I always make it, Mr. Latura.
Move it! Keep going!
Faster! Faster!
Don't look back! Keep going!
It's caving in!
- You played me, phone man!
Get down!
All the D.T.A.'s are pulling double shifts.
I don't care if some guy's wife
is having a baby.
Quiet, everybody. Everybody, quiet down.
Hey, shut up! Shut up, everybody!
The mid-riverjust went down.
No, no, no, no, no!
Mr. Latura!
- Easy, easy.
- I'm gonna die, right?
Don't talk, don't talk. Give me a scarf.
Please, I can't be going out like this, man.
I can't feel nothing.
I can't go out like this.
That's right. Don't talk.
Tell my father I was helping people
down here, all right?
I'll find him.
I'll tell your father that you were a real hero.
He won't...
He won't believe you.
Oh, Christ!
Oh, God, this is too much.
- Hey, stop him!
- Get off me!
Let me go! We're gonna drown!
No, you're not gonna drown! Listen to me!
You're going the wrong way.
This tunnel runs downhill.
The Manhattan end will be the first place
to fill up!
He's right.
Come on. This way. It's higher.
Excuse me. Excuse me!
I don't know what you know
and what you don't.
All I know is I've got a 14-year-old,
and her life means more than anything.
So I wanna be involved in any decisions.
Am I clear, Mr. Latura?
- That's fair enough.
- Latura? I read about you.
It was in the papers. Some kind of scandal?
- What kind of scandal?
- Not the kind that matters down here.
I beg to differ, Mr. Latura.
Scandals matter to Mrs. Trilling and myself.
Excuse me, ma'am, what kind of scandal?
He was chief
of the Emergency Medical Service.
Some people got killed,
and he was involved. That's all I remember.
What about it, Latura? Is that true?
I asked you a question,
and I want to know the answer!
- Is it true? Is that true?
- Hey! Hey!
Let's remember that
he came down here to help us,
so let's stop focusing on him
and focus on the problem!
She's right.
I'm sorry, Mr. Latura. That was very rude.
Rude? What is this, some kind
of goddamn New York country club?
- Watch your mouth.
- You don't have a child down here!
And his past may have
a great deal to do with our future!
We're gonna drown down here,
and he's all we've got!
If I'm all you've got, why don't you
meet me halfway? Is that fair enough?
- Are we gonna drown?
- No.
- What is your name?
- Ashley.
Ashley, there's time to stop the leak
before it gets high enough
to worry about drowning.
- That's the good news.
- What's the bad news?
This water's 38 degrees. What we
have to worry about is hypothermia.
- Hypo what?
- Hypothermia.
Your body loses heat and shuts down.
You feel like you're getting tired,
but you're really getting dead.
But that's not gonna happen to us,
because we're gonna look out
for each other.
We're gonna stay high and dry
right on this car dam over here,
so everybody get on the car dam.
Get the hell out of this water.
Let's get out of the water.
Excuse me, could you
please help me with the dog?
Thanks very much.
Here, boy. Come here.
Okay, so here we are. We're high and dry.
So what do you plan on doing?
In a situation like this,
it's very important that everybody
knows exactly what is happening, okay?
That last thing we need
is any more surprises, right?
What I'm gonna try to do
is collapse a section of that tube
to seal us off from the fire
and try to plug that leak.
- How do you plan to do that?
- I have to use an explosive.
- Wait, please, let me explain!
- Another explosion?
That's your idea down here?
No wonder you got people killed.
Steven.
If anyone has a better idea,
now is the time to tell me.
You don't know what kind of damage
this substructure's already sustained,
so how do you know you can
contain it to one section?
I don't know! I don't know anything!
The only thing I know is
we're not gonna make it another hour
unless I shut this thing down!
That I do know.
What we need is someone
to go to the Manhattan end
to see if we're making any progress, okay?
How about you?
No, you can't go, Daddy!
- I have a family. I don't want to leave them.
- But you're so good at it.
All right, I'll go.
- I know the place best, anyway.
- You're hired.
She wants her bracelet back.
- What?
- You're George, right?
Yeah.
Grace said to tell you
she wants her bracelet back.
- She told you that?
- Good luck, man.
She can't keep anything to herself.
Listen, you were the one
handling that live wire?
Yeah, but that was
a very different thing. I didn't know...
I need your help right now.
I appreciate that,
but I don't know anything...
Listen. It took a lot of guts to do that.
What's your name?
- Madelyne.
- Madelyne, I need your help, okay?
Look at this.
A stress hold design.
Better than we did on Brooklyn-Queens.
- What do you think we're gonna do here?
- Open it up.
Open it up? Let's open it up.
Okay. Still not getting any trace of them,
am I right?
There was a meltdown on the phone lines.
Walkie-talkies have been known to go dead.
Am I wrong in saying that you don't know
whether there's anyone to transmit, period?
- We saw people!
- Hours ago.
We're gonna break through
from the Manhattan side.
That's the consensus of the city engineers.
- Consensus my ass!
- Who's this?
That tunnel's being held up
by counterpoint pressure.
I asked your name!
Why don't you forget what her name is?
Listen to what she's saying to you.
You bring in heavy equipment,
cause a pressure shift,
the whole thing could implode.
- That's speculation.
- Maybe a little more time.
We are time poor. That tunnel is an artery.
The city is bleeding.
Look, you try to redirect
half a million people in and out of this city
without that tunnel, you got a problem
you don't wanna think about.
Are you saying that because
of a traffic problem
you're giving up on possible survivors?
Come on, man.
You got to hold off on the drill.
Look, the city engineers make the decisions.
You clean up the mess.
You're doing real good.
Doing real good?
Try scared to death.
Maybe, but you're dealing with it.
I think you should get someone else.
This is not one of my specialties.
Not a lot of people could handle
that cable the way you did.
Well, it's not like it had a lot of...
- It's okay. It's okay.
- I can't. I can't.
I know. You have a choice. It's like
the first person that ever ate a raw oyster.
- What are you talking about?
- Well, think about it.
A person would have to be starving to death
to get involved with a raw oyster.
He probably had to eat it or die.
Stay with me.
I'm here.
It was slimy. It smelled. It looked
like something out of a bad chest cold.
So there had to be that moment of truth
before he sucked that slider down.
- Staying with me?
- I'm here.
Think of that moment of truth.
Do I really need this?
Do I want this in my life? But he had to eat.
So he dug down and found the guts
just like you did.
- Is that a compliment?
- Yes. Come on. Where're you from?
- La Porte, Indiana.
- And what do you do?
I write. I try to get my plays produced.
Nobody goes to the theater anymore.
- And you were going home?
- Yeah. I was.
So... So tell me something, all right?
For real.
I probably won't be able to take it,
but are we gonna get out of here?
Madelyne, I wouldn't be down here
if I didn't think so. I swear.
- Promise?
- I promise. Now trust me. Come on.
So, this explosion that we're setting could
cause the whole thing to cave in, right?
- It could happen.
- It's better than a blowout.
A blowout?
I really hate the way that sounds.
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
Go back to "blowout. " Please explain.
If the water level was higher,
the pressure would build
and the air would blow to the top.
Like a cork? A geyser?
It happened to a couple of guys
digging the Baltimore Tunnel.
And what happened to them?
They died, right?
Help me open this pack.
They died, right?
One made it. Help me out.
All right, keep a tight grip.
We're gonna make it.
Kit!
Kit!
- You're insane!
- Give me that, Madelyne.
We're hot! Go!
Kit, what are you doing?
Go on. It's snagged!
Stay in there. Stay in there.
- What about you?
- The hell with me! Go!
Go! The hell with me.
Yes! He did it!
You okay?
We got to stop asking each other that.
What do you got? How big?
Three-point-three.
That's a hell of a bang, sir.
Three-bar!
Look out below! We're coming down!
Make more room!
We got to back up the ladder!
Hey! I heard machines!
I think they're going to try
to dig us out from the Manhattan end!
- No!
- What? They're digging. What's wrong?
The digging can shift pressure and bring
the place down. They're not thinking.
Or maybe they are
and they think we're dead.
Digging at the Manhattan end!
Latura! They're coming!
Oh, shit.
No!
George!
- Hold on, big man! Hold on!
- I can't move.
Can you feel your body?
George, can you feel your body?
I can't move.
- I can't feel my body.
- Okay, hold on, big man! Hold on!
Am I okay? Am...
Am... I... Okay?
Oh, God.
Am I okay?
It'll keep you alive.
Breathe through this, George.
Breathe, breathe. Please. Come on.
Steady breath! Breathe!
Don't let it beat you!
Come on, George! Breathe!
In and out! In! Come on, George! Come on.
Breathe!
Breathe, breathe, please.
Leverage! We need leverage!
Get that truck up!
Come on.
Oh, George.
Come on, come on.
We're coming.
- All right, got it? Take it.
- I'll take it.
- We're gonna make it.
- Thank you.
- Come on. Move, move, move!
- We got him!
Take that!
- All right, lift, lift, lift, lift!
- We're with you.
- We're right here.
- We're with you, George.
- Breathe as strong as you can.
- That's it, you got it!
George can't hear 'cause the water's going!
Come on, George.
Stay with us, George. Stay with us.
Oh, my God. He's going under.
Keep them coming!
- He's going under!
- Get it off him!
All right!
- Okay, let me know when.
- Okay!
One, two, three!
- We got him!
- He's out.
Okay, come on.
Get him out of the water.
Hold his head. Don't let his head go!
- Get the planks out of there!
- Keep it moving. Come on!
- Come on! Come on!
- Here it comes.
We got it.
Bring it down. Come on!
Get over here!
Everybody get ready to lift him on the count
of three. Ready? All right, all together.
One, two, three!
- You got him?
- Keep moving so we don't...
We need somebody up here!
Here we go now, all right?
Come on. Let's go.
- Let's go. It's freezing.
- You're doing great.
Together we can do it. We can do anything.
You're doing great. Ready?
All right, one, two, three. Lift!
I hope they're alive. Hang on.
We're doing the best we can.
I don't know. I don't know! Now, please.
- Do you have any survivors?
- I can't answer that.
Are you going to
guard the place?
Is it completely collapsed?
Are there any survivors?
I said that's it! That's it!
Why George? Why not some piece of trash?
Why is it always the good people?
I can't answer that. You just hope...
I mean, you just got to believe it.
I think some people
are gonna make it out of there.
And George is gonna be one.
Well, yeah, we got to think that.
Yeah, we do.
George, I'd give you my shirt,
but I don't think it'd do much good.
George, we'd give you
the shirt off our backs.
It'll be all right. Keep calm.
We're here with you.
How'd you get fired?
It's a long story. I wouldn't worry about it.
Stay awake now. Stay with us.
She said she read you got people killed.
She's right.
Did she mention it was
a building collapse in the South Bronx?
No, she said...
And that we were the first ones
on the scene?
No.
And some of the guys said,
"Forget it. They're probably dead anyway"?
Or read the part where I said
we were going in?
Or mention that I was wrong?
Hmm?
That a gas main blew on the way out
and three men died?
My friend's brother was one of them?
Did she mention the press,
the inquiry, the funerals?
You're a writer, you can
fill out the rest, can't you?
So you never had
a way out of here, did you?
No.
- What's that? What's the noise?
What's going on?
What does that mean, Mr. Latura?
What does that mean?
Kit, what's going on?
What's happening here?
The water wasn't
that high last time I looked.
The water must be coming back in
from somewhere!
I thought you stopped it.
I slowed it down. Nothing can stop it.
So what you're saying is
nothing can save us.
You asked us to trust you.
We did. For what?
- To die a slow death in here?
- Are there no options?
- There's always a chance.
How can you lie like that?
Since you're already in hell,
I guess it's not a problem.
Just let him talk.
We've heard enough talking.
We don't need any more speeches.
That's bullshit.
She's speaking for herself, Kit.
We're still alive, Sarah.
It ain't over.
Very over! You wanna kid yourself.
Go ahead, do it.
False hope and now no hope!
You've given us both.
Thanks for nothing. Thanks for nothing!
- Sarah. Sarah.
- I can't stand this shit.
- What's plan "B", Kit?
- There's no plan.
- We're with you!
- We can try taking down another section.
We could build another dam
if we all pitched in.
We can beat it.
I could check the Manhattan end.
I think I could do it. Let me try, Kit!
Can you get us out of here?
I'm sorry about what my mom said.
Just please,
just try and get us out of here! Please!
- I need your help, George.
- Yeah?
The bunk rooms off the tunnels,
is there a way in?
I don't know.
George, I know you're hurt, but think.
Bassett said the sandhogs had bunk rooms
down here for long shifts. Think.
Maybe there's a trapdoor,
a hatch, a ladder, something.
- There's a booth.
- Booth? Where?
Booth three.
At the New Jersey end. Booth three.
Steven, keep everybody together
until I get back. George?
- Yeah?
- Thanks.
Yeah.
Come on. You stay with us.
Did you ever have a dog?
My mom's liked everything in the world
except two things: dogs and me.
Well, she was probably bit once.
I know I was.
So, Ashley, where do you live?
- We're from Maryland.
- Maryland. Maryland's nice.
- Yeah.
Well, listen, if we don't die in here, I was
wondering if maybe I could give you a call.
He thinks he's being attacked now.
Exactly.
- Why don't you go ahead and pet him.
- We've had him for ten years.
- That's a long time.
- Yeah, it is.
Do you have any children?
Our son Jonathan.
He went trekking in Nepal.
He caught some kind of a fever.
Nothing could be done, they said.
We... We lost him.
- Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't...
- Oh, no, no.
- No, no.
- I didn't...
Ever since Jonathan died,
Cooper's all we've had left.
I guess I spoil him. You understand?
Yeah.
Kit! It's Kit!
Everybody, Kit!
I found some dry ground.
There's always a chance.
Come on. Let's move.
Why don't we take George now?
We're gonna check out booth three,
then go back and get him. Keep moving!
Okay.
- George.
- Hi.
My neck's broken, isn't it?
Yes.
You find the room?
Yeah, it's...
It's through this underwater passage.
It's very difficult. I think that
with a little bit of luck we could...
Christ, I don't know what to think.
I do. You just have to leave me.
- No, no, that's dumb. That's stupid.
- Yeah.
- We can make it.
- Not with a broken neck.
Yes, George. I just need some time to figure
it out. Really, I just need some time.
Hey, take the bracelet for me.
Please. It's in my pocket. My right pocket.
- George, don't quit on me.
- Take it.
- Don't quit on me.
- Take it, please.
- No.
- Take it!
Please.
Please, give me that much respect.
Jesus, there's just so much I wish I'd done.
I never had me a nice car.
Never had any kids.
I finally meet a woman I love,
I didn't even get the chance
to tell her that I love her.
- You think she knows?
- Yeah.
- You think so?
- She knows. I'm sure she does.
That's good.
Get them to daylight.
Don't let them die in this place? Hear?
Tell them I'm gone.
You've done all you could do.
You know it and I know it.
I'm very sorry.
I love you, Grace.
I'm sorry.
What does that mean?
I don't know, Ellie. The structure's shifting.
What about George?
George didn't make it.
Huh?
Don't.
I know everybody's freezing, but we
have to make a short swim underwater.
Underwater? Well, I'm not
so sure I can do this.
Look, if I can do it, you can do it.
Everybody take three deep breaths and go.
We can do this.
Come on, baby. Come on.
I can't. I can't do this! I can't.
One, two, three.
And go. Come on.
Come on. Keep going. Get up there.
Three!
I'm right behind you, Eleanor.
Yes! Go!
Here we go, boy. Go, boy.
Quick, get her out of the water.
Help her out. Help her out.
Go ahead.
All right, everybody stay together.
All right, everybody stay together.
Use each other's body heat. Fight the cold.
Stay warm. Stay in groups.
- Don't stay alone. Okay? Stay in groups.
- Okay.
- What do we do now, Kit?
- We don't do nothing.
We just sit here and wait
and pray they get here.
Wait? Wait? That's it?
There's... There's nothing we can do?
You did what you could.
You did great. You did great.
You got to fight it.
- Fight the cold.
- I'm trying.
Just fight it. Just fight it.
Where's Cooper?
Where's Cooper? Where's Cooper?
It broke. I couldn't hold him.
- Oh, my God!
- My God, I tried. I tried.
- Oh, my God! I can't lose him!
- Ellie. Ellie! No.
- No.
- It was Jonathan's dog.
Look, look, Eleanor.
Listen to me. Listen to me.
We can't bring them back.
They're both gone.
We can't change that.
We've got to help each other let them go.
Don't let's fight.
Hold me.
Hold me.
Jesus! They're gonna save us to death.
Oh, my God!
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- Get back. Get back.
Don't let those things touch you!
Move away! Move away!
Latonya!
Come on, Sarah.
I'm not leaving.
Move, move, move, move!
- Come on. Sarah.
Listen!
Oh, God! I don't wanna die
like this! I don't wanna die like this!
I don't wanna die like this!
It's okay, Latonya. I'm coming.
I'm coming, Latonya. Hold on.
I don't wanna die like this!
- I hate them!
- All right, here I come.
- I don't wanna go like this!
- Hang on. I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm here.
They can't hurt you, okay?
They're just shit with feet.
Okay? Shit with feet. Can you say that?
Don't look down.
- Watch out!
- All right! All right!
Keep them away from your feet!
Shit with feet, baby.
They know a way out.
Steven, help me get this thing off the wall!
Get it off!
There's a room! There's another room!
No, no! Not now!
Give me some tools! Anything!
Find anything you can! Come on!
Let's try to pop these rivets.
- Roger!
Sarah, over here!
Roge... Roger!
I thought she was resting.
I'm sorry.
Roger, we got to get out of here.
There's no way she wanted you to die down
here too. Roger, she wants you to live.
I'm not gonna leave her!
Okay. Okay.
If you're staying, I'm staying.
I'm not leaving anybody behind again.
- Roger, come on!
- Let's go. Come on.
We're moving out. Out!
Come on. Get up!
We're not leaving you. We gotta go.
- Come on. Get up. We gotta go.
The water's getting higher!
Come on, come on!
I see them!
Right there, the rats! At the top of the stairs.
Kit, they're going up the stairs.
There's something at the top of the stairs!
Oh, no!
Get up. Come on. Come on, Madelyne, up.
Get up!
All right, go, go, go! Move it! Up the stairs!
Up the stairs! Go!
Keep going!
Kit! I got you!
Hold on!
All right. Go!
All right. Go!
- Come on. Let's move!
Let's go!
Kit, I've got a way out!
I found a way out! Come on, everybody!
It looks like some kind of
unfinished sewer system.
Oh, my God! It's the lady's dog!
Cooper!
- No, no, no. Forget it.
- Cooper!
It's just a stupid dog.
Shut up, Vincent!
It's just a dog!
Let me get him!
There's a way out up here! Will you forget it!
Leave the stupid dog.
Shut the hell up, Vincent!
Oh, no.
I don't believe it!
Come on.
Come on, Cooper!
Oh, shit!
Kit! Kit! Kit!
- Keep going!
Not without you!
- Forget about me! There's no time!
- No, we'll make time!
- Steven, do something.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Pull it!
- Damn!
Roger, there's nothing to throw.
We can't find anything!
- Hold on!
- This place is coming apart!
- You wouldn't leave us!
- I would leave you!
I left George! I left him to die! Get out!
- Take this. Here.
- Come on, come on.
- No, no, no! Don't do it!
- Reach for it!
Madelyne, no. No.
It's collapsing!
Oh, my God!
Why didn't you leave?
What the hell did you do?
Damn!
Get a hold of something!
Go, go, Steven! You got to keep going!
What the hell are you talking about?
You can't leave us!
- They gotta leave.
- Mikey, there's got to be another way!
We can't find anything.
- Sweetheart, look for some...
There must be something else!
Can you make it?
There's no way out!
You can't reach us! That's home up there!
No!
What do we do?
Ashley, flashlight! Here!
- No.
Ah, man, no.
Kit!
No, Steven! Don't leave me!
Go! You heard me! Go! Everybody, out!
We got to go!
I didn't leave you, Mikey! I'll die!
Go, go! Watch your head!
Oh, God!
Go! Come on. Keep going!
Go, go, go, go, go!
No.
We're not gonna get out of here, are we?
Come on.
Kit, I can't.
Come on.
What's that?
Fuses. We've got to go back
to where we started.
No. No, Kit, it's too far.
No, no. Anything I can do, you can do.
Here, hold this.
We got to try it!
What?
A blowout.
- A blow... A blowout?
- We got to do it! Come on!
We're gonna try a blowout. Come on.
Where are we going?
Got to get up to the ceiling
and blast out the mud.
If it works,
the pressure will take us right to the top.
Why don't you leave your car here
and I'll drive you home?
Oh, my God.
I got you, girl. I got you.
Easy. Easy. Take it easy.
Easy. Easy. Okay, come on.
Take it easy now.
- You're all right.
- Easy, easy.
Roger, we did it!
Come on. We made it.
Okay.
Come on. It's okay. Good dog.
Easy. All right.
Come on. We got you. We got you.
Okay. All right, all right.
That's everybody. Everybody's out.
Are you sure
there's nobody else down there?
Hole's filling up with water.
Everybody's out.
- Nobody else?
- Leave me alone.
I'm okay. I'm all right.
- I'm okay.
- No, Daddy, it's okay.
It's okay. We're okay.
Come on. Come on.
Go ahead.
I'm gonna sit. I'm gonna sit over here.
- I don't even care. I feel so tired.
- You got to fight it.
I never thought I'd end up like this.
You weren't supposed to.
You weren't supposed to.
I always thought I'd die old.
Keep trying, you piece of shit! Keep trying!
How many chances do you need?
You killed everybody else,
but you know what?
You should've killed me!
'Cause I found your heart!
I found your heart,
and I'll blow it out of your body!
We got to go.
Give me your arm, Madelyne.
You never would have left us, would you?
No. No.
Kit.
- All right, easy. Easy. Easy.
- Slide it over.
Clear a path. Come on. Easy.
- We have a wheelchair for you, ma'am.
- It's all right. I'm gonna walk.
Hey. All right.
You're doing fine.
Stop. Stop, stop, stop.
Grace.
All right, come on.
Let's get him out of here. Come on. Let's go.
Since we're both going to the hospital,
I wanna ride with you.
Don't you have something better to do?
Well, considering I'm homeless
and broke and carless
and I'm not looking my best,
I think I'll ride with you.
- One condition.
- What's that?
We got to take the bridge.
Like the well
Becomes a spring
Like the light
That you bring
To the skies
that were empty
And gray
Mmm-hmm
Just your breath
In the night
Can make it all right
When you sigh
as you're drifting away
- Ooo
- Oh, baby
All that is simple and good
lives in the places you stood
The things that are pure and true
Paint a picture of you
And you are all I can think of
Whenever there is love
Whenever there is love
Whenever there is love
Ooo
- Like a brief desert rain
- Like
Desert rain
Like the air that remains
Making everything suddenly new
- Oh, baby
- Oh, baby
And like
The light in your eyes
- Like the light in your eyes
- As if you and I
Found a world that was only for two
- Oh, tell me, baby
- Ooh
All that is simple and good
lives in the places you stood
The things that are pure and true
Paint a picture of you
And you are all I can think of
Whenever there is love
Whenever there is love
Whenever there is love
Ooo-oooh
- If you are lost I will find you
- I'll find you
- I'll find you
- I'll find you
- No matter where you go
- Ooh
If you fall I'm here behind you
All that is simple and good
lives in the places you stood
The things that are pure and true
Paint a picture of you
And you are all I can think of
- Whenever there is love
- Ooo
- Whenever
- Baby
- Whenever there is love
- Whenever, whenever
Whenever there is love
- Whenever there is love
- Whenever there is love
- Whenever there is love
- Whenever there is love
Whenever there is
- Love
- Whenever, whenever
There is love
Ooo
