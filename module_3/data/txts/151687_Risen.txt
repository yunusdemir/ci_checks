Roman, huh?
That's a tribune's ring?
Yes.
Have you come far?
Legion 10!
Move forward!
Now! Come on!
Come on!
For 30 years, the Roman
Empire of Tiberius Caesar
has ruled the wasteland
of Judaea and its people.
Barabbas! Barabbas!
As tribune to Prefect
Pontius Pilate,
my task is to keep order in a
city that is steeped in unrest.
Simple formation!
The Jews pray to their single God, Yahweh,
for the arrival of the mystical Messiah
as their religious leaders, the
Sanhedrin, try to keep an uneasy peace.
But each day creates more zealots
to challenge the rule of Rome
and bring freedom.
Instead, we bring them death.
Pilum up!
Pilum ranks, launch!
Launch!
Form up!
Draw!
Testudo!
Hold this line!
Forward!
Forward!
Tribune, we have Barabbas!
Bring him.
I know how this ends.
Then tell Yahweh you are
coming, courtesy of Mars.
It must pain you to know that the
one true God chooses us over you.
Not today, he didn't.
When the Messiah comes,
Rome will be nothing!
Until then...
Tribune, Pilate summons you.
I'm yet sticky with filth.
No matter. There's more trouble.
Come on, come on!
Did you win?
I was told to hurry.
In truth, you're well
dressed for this job.
- What's happened?
- Passover.
Every hothead and holy fool in
Judaea was here, stirring the pot.
Some ascetic won a
following by making waves,
so the Sanhedrin decided to put him down.
They sent a lathered mob here,
screaming for his blood
because he claims to be their Messiah.
I had to crucify him.
Don't give me that look.
I've had enough already.
I had a situation, Tribune, something
you don't seem to understand.
Soon, the Emperor arrives here,
and he expects to find order.
Order!
What is it you want
of me, Prefect?
Take control out there
and finish things.
This has gone on long enough.
And do this Nazarene
a small mercy.
Break his legs.
Clavius, meet your new aide.
Lucius Tycho Ennius.
His father's a friend.
It is an honor, Tribune.
What sky is this? Last
hour, the sun was shining.
Easy.
Easy.
Poseidon's unhappy.
Some god is.
Move! Stand back!
Get back!
I hate it when they scream.
I hate it.
He could last for
days, that one.
Get back now!
Centurion, how goes this?
A strange day, Tribune.
It was just a tremor.
That and too much dark in the air.
But this "king". Something's wrong.
And the mob feel it.
Smite a few. Show them the rod.
The Nazarene, is he dead yet?
After only six hours, he can't be.
Has he spoken?
- Has he spoken?
- Just before the tremor.
He said, "It's finished."
See that it is.
Finally.
It won't be long now.
That's the Nazarene's mother.
Hold!
Use the pilum.
Get that woman to shut up.
Keep her quiet!
Aren't you the lucky one?
Surely this man was innocent.
Steel yourself, man. Go on and
tell the Prefect it's done.
Disperse! It's over!
Go on home!
Move! Leave now! Leave!
You, go on! Go!
That's it, let go. That's it, let it go.
Deep breath out.
Deep breath. That's it.
That's it. Let it go.
Get the pliers.
I never killed a king before.
Wait!
Tribune, I come from Pilate.
Please read this.
- You're the Arimathean.
- I am.
Your own family tomb?
What's he to you?
The Sabbath is almost here.
I have merely two hours.
Please.
He's yours.
Nicodemus, hurry.
Mary.
Leave him.
Sir?
Go and find your centurion.
These will bury him.
Please, Tribune.
Gently. Gently.
Come, Clavius, soak this day away.
Fill his cup. Keep it filled.
What do you desire?
A meal? A massage? A girl?
Just this.
You're young.
A night's rest, you'll do it all again.
Your service is valued, Tribune.
I rely on it.
So ask pardon, if
today I seemed vexed.
No matter.
Is the Nazarene entombed?
I helped push the stone against it myself.
Huge stone.
Many admirers.
Let's hope that's buried with him.
It's a strange case.
I've never seen a death so
wished for, even by him.
It's as if he wanted to be sacrificed.
They are fanatics.
Yahweh deranges them.
Yes. No other gods and all that.
I myself pray only to
Minerva, for wisdom. You?
Mars.
Of course.
Well, let's hope one of them hears us.
I could use the help.
One does what one must.
I don't wish the mantle you wear.
Spare me. It's your path, too.
Your ambition is noticed.
Where do you hope it will lead?
Rome.
And?
Position. Power.
- Which brings?
- Wealth.
A good family. Someday,
a place in the country.
Where you'll find?
An end to travail.
A day without death.
Peace.
All that for peace?
Is there no other way?
Well,
I'm to bed.
Tomorrow promises
further punishment.
The Nazarene, did you
find him different?
I found him dead.
So you did.
- Peace, Tribune, and good night.
- Good night.
A coin for the ferryman.
Journey well, Gaius Aelius.
Legion, forward.
Legion 10.
Fretensis!
Tribune, Pilate summons you.
Salve, Prefect.
You smell of meat. A feast?
A funeral.
There's your solution.
Burn him in public.
God forbids cremation.
He also forbids labor on the
Sabbath, and yet here you are.
Tribune.
- Burn who?
- The crucified Nazarene.
- Why?
- He's business unfinished.
The man's dead, Caiaphas.
His followers are in hiding.
He's no longer a threat
to your monopoly on piety.
But still a threat, Prefect.
While alive, that deceiver said he
would rise again after three days.
He foretold it.
We request that the
sepulcher be sealed,
lest his disciples come in
the night, steal the body
and say that he is risen from death.
That would cause more unrest in this
city than all his blasphemies combined.
You have your own guard.
Secure it yourself.
My words exactly.
To which I replied,
"We need a Roman seal."
This must be seen as the
impartial will of the Prefect.
And not yours.
We seek only what Caesar seeks.
Peace in Jerusalem,
peace in Judaea.
Which you will lose if
this body vanishes.
Hence my summoning.
Just see to it.
Satisfy yourself.
- Seal it.
- Seal.
No one touches those seals before
sunset tomorrow. Understood?
Then tell the priests.
Where's your centurion?
He's not himself, sir.
Not since yesterday.
Is that what pains you?
No, sir. No.
It's just... We were
to have the night off.
I'll have rations sent.
You're Sanhedrin,
too, are you not?
Yes.
Your brothers despise this
man, yet you mourn him.
He was very special.
A king?
You test me, Tribune.
What was his name? The Nazarene.
He was called Yeshua.
Move.
He forgot. You know he did.
They'd have sent food by
now if he had told them.
He's an officer.
Yeah, if we'd forgot, could
you fathom the beating?
I was saving it for supper, but...
You prince!
You absolute champion.
Oh, yeah.
I thought the night was lost.
- Tribune, Pilate...
- Summons me.
- He's gone.
- The Nazarene?
Of course, the Nazarene.
His tomb is stone empty.
- Who brought this news? The guards?
- Your guards are missing!
Some simpleton reported it.
Who did you put on the detail?
I want them found and lashed.
To death, preferably.
Let me investigate.
That would be helpful, before Caiaphas
and his pack of raving Jews show up here.
Too late.
Tribune.
Shall we dispense with lies?
The guards have told me.
They came to you?
Seeking sanctuary. They know the
penalty for sleeping on duty.
- What happened?
- Exactly as I had predicted.
The heretic's disciples came in
the night and stole the body.
Already, they are proclaiming
him risen from death.
Will the people believe it?
The weak will. Others want to.
So we must announce the theft.
Will they believe you?
They'll believe the guards,
if you don't kill them first.
Endless.
Proclaim it before this blossoms.
It's not enough.
Without a corpse to prove him dead,
we have a potential Messiah.
I want no doubt. Tiberius
cannot arrive to unrest.
We must find a body.
- Will you help?
- Of course. But proclaim it.
Was my confidence in you
misplaced, Tribune?
Perhaps you'd prefer a post in hell.
You will track down each and
every one of these disciples.
But more importantly, you will find
the corpse of this cursed Yeshua
before it rots.
Bring the Arimathean.
You, get the Arimathean.
As if they burst.
Tribune, see this.
Oh, my!
- Where has he gone?
- You tell me.
The body, was it anointed?
We had no time. We just wrapped
him with myrrh and aloe.
That's what you see, sweat and herbs.
Bring it.
I want nothing touched here.
Post a watch, have everything
leaving Jerusalem searched.
Arrest anyone claiming the Nazarene
lives, and find out where they heard it.
Yes, Tribune.
And comb the city for bodies
dead in the last week.
Examine each for marks of the crucified.
Dig them up?
Every one. And bring
him to me presently.
Tribune.
I said, "In private."
Where's your fellow?
He doesn't wish to speak.
Truly?
Well, he had no trouble
avowing the Nazarene's theft.
He's afraid, as am I.
So you should be.
You disgraced me. And
sleeping on post means death.
But the Prefect has spared you.
You both can return to barracks.
Unpunished?
If you bare yourself honestly
about what happened.
We were attacked in the
night while sleeping
by the Nazarene's
rabid disciples.
They stole his body and
bade us say he is risen.
Rabid?
How many attacked you?
Eight. Ten. I'm not sure.
- All armed?
- Yes.
And you saw this while sleeping?
No. No, I... We...
We awoke as they were
cutting the ropes.
- Cutting them?
- Yes.
Yes.
And then they rolled
away the stone,
took his body and ran.
While you watched?
Yes, but we were
held at spear point.
Soldier,
have you been told
to say these things?
- Were you drinking that night?
- No.
- No?
- No.
What else is a lie?
Open the doors!
- Stolen?
- So they claim.
Well, so what?
They really fear he
rose from death.
Perhaps the Messiah.
Anyway, so I heard.
Arrest him.
Turn him.
How old is this one?
At least a week.
- These?
- The thieves he died with.
We're done.
In two days, he'll
be unrecognizable.
Wait till you see combat.
No.
The hand's missing, but see
the hole in the other?
Not him. Legs are broken.
That's why we need your eyes, Tribune.
This grave here is very hasty and shallow.
Well?
Two score, we questioned. Eleven,
I think, you should examine.
One, I suspect, could be a disciple.
- Forgive me, Tribune.
- Take some chicory.
In time, the stomach
numbs to these things.
- Now bring them in, one by one.
- Sir.
Who took the body?
I don't know.
They say you are an honest man
and also a follower of Yeshua.
Truth will not prove fatal today.
I was moved by what he
said and what he taught.
And felt he didn't deserve such a death.
They ripped open your
tomb to steal a corpse
to promote a lie that threatens
Rome and the Sanhedrin.
It was not Yeshua's followers.
Not the true ones.
They are heartbroken.
Some say he is risen
to lead Israel against us.
The Messiah.
Do you believe that?
If he had lived,
I believe Yeshua would
embrace you as a brother.
Even as you slew him.
Leave us.
I will try other means before
I am forced to break you.
One thing has been withheld
from you, Tribune.
I confess.
You asked if he was a king.
I return his crown.
Sit.
Why do you tremble?
You're a Roman.
You were heard shouting,
"Yeshua yet lives."
Joyously, says the report.
Why? You obviously
didn't see him.
I heard it on the street.
- From passersby?
- No.
- I heard him.
- Yeshua.
Two days ago.
I know voices. I hear them.
I have no doubt.
Were you a follower of
the Nazarene, Miriam?
Or just a follower
of a follower?
He loved me.
An old woman.
He lifted me up.
Lifted you?
If you knew him,
you'd understand.
Stop spreading rumors men
are lifted from death.
Come.
Don't you wish to
know what he said?
Of course.
"You are seeds already cast."
- You're too late.
- Come.
Next one, Tribune.
Next one, I believe.
I pray not to thee today, divine Mars,
but to the god of the Hebrews, Yahweh.
Hear me.
Take back your favor in defense of these
people I seek, and relinquish them to me.
If you do this with clear
and recognizable signs,
I vow to erect temples for you
and initiate games in your honor.
Do you know what I seek?
Yes.
So, who told you the
crucified Nazarene is alive?
A friend of a friend.
A friend of Yeshua?
Perhaps a disciple?
Whatever you say, make it truth.
This friend said he was told
the sighting was told of by
two women.
They went to the tomb before dawn
that morning and found it empty.
Then later met
Yeshua on the road.
Alive.
Their names.
One way or another,
we will have our answer.
I know only one.
A woman of the street.
Mary Magdalene.
Last time she was spotted was on the
morning the body was stolen. Early.
Not seen since.
That's all I have, Tribune.
- Where does she work?
- Work? She's of the street.
You're bringing no one to identify her?
Who? Who would that be?
Who among you knows the
woman Mary Magdalene?
They outflanked us, so
we had to withdraw.
A fighting retreat.
Some dozen of our men were caught
and dragged up into the hills.
Later that night, down in the valley,
we heard them screaming and looked up
to see them staked out on the
ridge tops so we could watch.
That is why you
offer no quarter.
Is that her?
No.
That's her.
Halt!
Shalom, Mary.
Why did you run from us?
Instinct.
I've seen you before.
My other life?
At Yeshua's death. You were
there beside his mother.
Was she also the woman
with you at his tomb?
If you knew what happened there,
all cares would cease.
Enlighten me, then.
It's
beyond us.
Spare me the riddles
and zealot babble.
Where did you take Yeshua?
He's right here.
Is he a goblin? A sprite?
Alive again somehow?
Open your heart and see.
I see delusion to
keep a crusade alive.
I could have what I want pulled from
you, put you to death like that.
It doesn't matter.
- A martyr.
- No.
Then give me the others,
and I'll grant you freedom.
I'm already free.
Show me the Messiah.
Alive or dead.
And show me those
who follow him.
You look for something
you'll never find, Tribune.
You look for the wrong thing.
She's mad, refuses
to talk sense.
Perhaps a witch, sir.
Should I have her stoned?
At least locked up?
Just...
Let her go.
Sir?
Release her. The
woman's touched.
Two days without sleep, Tribune.
You'll start seeing things.
- When that turns, wake me.
- Sir.
You, up.
Move.
Tribune.
Your sand has run out,
and Pilate summons you.
You're digging up the dead?
No stone unturned, Prefect.
But a Hebrew cemetery?
It seemed logical. He's
Jewish and deceased.
Do you not realize
the wrath incurred?
Another day or two, and wrath won't matter.
Nature will have taken its course.
Caesar's spies will
hear of all of this.
An unfortunate dilemma.
For both of us, Tribune.
I want his body here by tonight.
The disciples are key. We
find them, we find him.
For your help.
There's more if you
assist us further.
The Nazarene's disciples,
how many are there?
Their names? Their plans?
Their weapon caches?
Where do they gather?
Who leads them now?
Where are they
hiding his corpse?
Work quickly.
There are 12.
Well,
11 now.
Yeshua's inner circle.
- All hiding. I know not where.
- Do you have names again?
I'll give you one.
Who's Bartholomew?
I am he.
Bring him.
What do you hope to win
by spreading fantasy?
By mine own eyes, Tribune,
I walked with him.
He spoke to me. It's
unbelievable, but it is so.
Then conjure him up.
Right now.
Or show me the body he must
have shed like a snake skin.
God is not at my beck and call.
God?
Yahweh manifests himself through
a crazy, poor, dead Jew.
Well, so it appears.
And what does this rebirth mean?
Eternal life.
For everyone, everyone
who believes.
Marvelous recruiting tool.
Much better than salt.
How many are you?
Well, we are few for now,
and our only weapon is love.
But this, well, this
changes everything.
What are your intentions?
Why do you fear him so? This
empire means nothing to him.
"Render unto Caesar what is
Caesar's." That's what he taught us.
What if I ordered
your crucifixion?
Well, I would happily submit.
Strike.
Ever watch a man crucified?
No.
No.
I don't remember seeing you
there, probably because you ran.
Didn't you?
Shall I tell you
what you missed?
Feel it.
Imagine having this
driven through your arms.
And then the same driven
through your feet, your feet.
Can you imagine it?
It's what you hang from.
Nails, rubbing on bone.
You have to decide what's worse.
The agony here.
Or here.
And choose which torture your own
weight will inflict constantly.
And then you discover
you can't breathe.
And you realize you will
never breathe easily again.
And that every breath for the
rest of your horrific life
will be like sucking
through wet cloth.
Yeshua was lucky. He only
hung like that for hours.
Most take days, gasping
for someone to kill them.
And if he still felt
anything at the end,
he surely felt the spear thrust up under
his ribs to pierce his heart and lungs.
I didn't watch closely, but they must
have had to break bones getting him down.
- Sometimes, they bury them...
- Enough.
Enough.
Let's not speak any
more of his body.
It must be hideous to look upon by now.
But I ask you one last time.
Where are the other disciples?
I will not ask again.
Tell me, and you're free.
Give your word.
My word.
Where are they?
They're
everywhere.
Are there any others?
None that you could
still recognize.
Are we finished, Tribune?
It's him?
See the nail holes
here, here and here.
The wound in the side.
But the face. I can't tell.
Nor can anyone else.
Let it be so, Prefect.
At this point, almost any
corpse could be the Nazarene.
I'll still find those who took him.
That's the threat.
Threat
is a creature with many heads.
Right now, I need you elsewhere.
Trouble in Hebron.
But something yet needs
unraveling with this.
Just allow me until next week.
Next week, I need you in Hebron.
You are dangerously
clever, Tribune.
Can I turn my back on you?
That's what I fear
the most, Prefect.
From the same cloth.
I remember when I was
you, so sure, so...
I forget.
But in the end, what does
it all matter, really?
Pardon?
In a few years,
that's us.
Open!
What goes?
Rumor has it we're heading to Hebron,
so I took the liberty, Tribune.
Your tomb guards
have been sighted.
They finally fled the temple.
- Where?
- It's unclear.
But it is said they have
come into some money.
I know you wish to triumph, sir.
I know things will
happen in time.
Your ambition is noticed.
Sing it!
That's the one.
Sing the song.
Sing... No, don't stop.
Don't stop.
Sing it again! Sing
it again, please!
Come on. That was good.
They're good, aren't they?
Yes, it's a nice song.
It's a nice song. It's a nice...
Pricey wine for a legionary.
You've been hiding. Where did
you gain silver like this?
Off a dead man.
Of course.
So what?
I was pardoned by the Prefect.
Pardoned.
Nothing can be done to me now.
I said what they...
What was proclaimed.
Say it again.
Why?
To see how your tale
matches your mate's.
We were attacked in the night while
sleeping by the rabid disciples.
The priests paid you to say this.
They stole his body and bade
us say that he is risen.
How did the stone fall
10 paces from the tomb?
It took seven men, myself
included, just to roll it closed.
And the ropes weren't cut.
They were torn as if thread.
The seals melted like butter.
Shall we go there?
No!
Why does it bother you so?
No more lies.
How did they take him?
What happened to the
Nazarene's body?
You forgot us.
Forgot! We'd had no supper.
That's why the wine made us slumber.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we slept.
We'd been up two days
since the crucifixion.
What could happen
guarding the body of a dead man?
So we closed our eyes in
turns for a bit until...
Until what?
Until we was wakened
by this terrible...
This terrible...
This terrible flash.
The night was gone.
The air smelled burned,
and the ropes, they just...
They just exploded.
And the stone flew like a leaf.
And all of a sudden, the sun
rose in the tomb.
It was the sun.
It was...
It was everything.
And then a figure appeared
that I could not gaze upon
because of the terrible light,
and it wasn't a man.
It wasn't.
And there was this voice all
around I could not fathom.
And then we went running.
We ran so far and long.
So far, until we could...
Until we could think again.
And then we went and told the priests
because that's what you bade us do.
And Caiaphas paid you
for a different story.
Tribune,
I have seen much in the
service of the Emperor.
Cannibals and...
And the Blue Celts
in Gaul and...
I've seen a man taken
by a serpent at sea.
But never I witnessed
a moment so...
So...
Explain it to me.
You were drunk.
You saw the dawn burst.
The wine you drank was tainted.
Truly?
Do you suppose?
Maybe it was opium
or frankincense?
Maybe the disciples stole the
Nazarene's body with magic,
as the priests said.
Maybe our story is true.
What else could it be?
I don't know.
So I drink.
Sir.
Tribune.
We have them.
It's the Romans!
Come. Come quickly.
That's the house. That's
where I lost him.
Lost him?
- I believe that's where he went in.
- You believe?
Yes, sir. When
coming to tell you,
I passed other disciples
hurrying this way.
They favor the upper room.
You didn't pay for that.
It's the Romans. Quickly!
Tribune.
You six, this side. Check
every house, every room.
You five, the other side. I want
at least two alive, so spare some!
Go, go! Move! Come on, move!
I'll block the end and
work my way back!
No!
Tribune, anything? Tribune?
Nothing. Stand down.
Return to camp.
Sir? Tribune?
Stand down.
Look for me shortly.
Tribune. Sir, we are close.
I can feel it.
I don't need you for this.
I don't need you.
Sir.
Stand down!
Soldiers, stand down!
March on!
Welcome, Clavius.
Come join us, brother.
There are no enemies here.
Thomas.
- Lord.
- Thomas, where have you been?
I'm sorry.
Sorry? Why are you sorry?
Because I left you.
I'm alive. See?
We have nothing to fear.
We are free.
- Touch this.
- Your wound.
And this.
Does it hurt?
How can this be?
Yeshua?
Yeshua?
Yeshua?
Yeshua?
Is he coming back?
Where did he go?
How would I know?
What now?
Simon?
He said, "Stay in Jerusalem"
till we receive
some spirit.
Well, what did we just receive?
I don't know.
- Galilee.
- What?
When he appeared on the road,
Yeshua said, "Tell my brothers to go
to Galilee, and there they'll see me."
I told you this.
We have seen him.
In Galilee, you'll
see him once more.
And avoid them.
Simon?
Then we go.
- We go, brothers.
- Be well, Mary.
- Goodbye, Mary.
- Farewell, Mary.
- Glory.
- Goodbye, brothers. Farewell.
- Up there!
- Move!
Is it a ransom?
"Do not seek me.
"Do not follow or wonder.
"Persecute no one on my behalf.
"I have seen two things
which cannot reconcile.
"A man dead without question
"and that same man alive again.
"I pursue him, the Nazarene,
to ferret the truth.
"Clavius Aquila Valerius Niger."
It's his seal, sir.
- Must be a plague.
- My right hand turned against me.
How could he follow that Hebrew?
Perhaps
it's true.
Well, if it is,
I'll kill him again.
Brothers, we go.
Alive, if you can.
Although dead would
be less embarrassing.
I'll be in Caesarea.
Sir.
Moving out! North to Galilee.
Ten days till the
Emperor arrives.
Ten days.
Forward.
Do you need some help, Thomas?
I brought water!
Water!
That's a scar.
I hope you know that.
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?
Yahweh, hallowed is your name.
Give us, today, this daily bread,
and forgive us our debts, as we
have also forgiven our debtors.
Lead us not into temptation,
but
away
from evil.
- Amen.
- Amen.
But the son of Yahweh?
And you believe it?
And you believe it?
After this, yes.
He rises from death, eats,
sleeps and then disappears.
He has a body,
the same vessel
Yahweh gives all men.
It is how he has
reached out to us.
I haven't every answer.
We're astounded, too.
Why not just show
himself to all, then?
Or can he be slain once more?
I don't know.
I don't know, I don't
know, I don't know.
I wish I did, but I don't.
The answers wait in Galilee?
We are followers.
We follow to find out.
I think he is preparing us.
For what?
Down.
Pilate will not let this rest.
I bring danger to you all.
They have a tracker.
They can't know we're up here.
They already do.
I found the enemy.
And they're out for blood.
It doesn't scare us.
Not anymore.
Then fear the death of what
you're entrusted with.
Move back.
Down.
Put your head down.
Move, move. Move, move.
This way.
Low. Come. Keep low.
Stay down.
Beneficiarii, please.
No quarter, Tribune.
That's what you taught.
A bad lesson.
I give you the teacher.
But let them pass.
The Nazarene?
Vanished.
There are no enemies here.
Over here!
You hold the world in
your hands, Beneficiarii.
Know that.
I believe
it resides in these men.
No one dies today.
No one.
Walk on.
Say nothing.
Remember this.
Why do you think here?
It was here that he
called us to follow him.
Sometimes, he's
hard to recognize.
Simon! Simon!
Simon, they want to eat.
Then let's fish.
Let's fish! Come!
Come! Come on!
He'll find us!
Come on.
We are here!
Brothers,
let's fish!
Pull. Pull. That's it.
Cast again?
Twice more.
Then sleep till the
sun wakes you.
Any luck?
Try the right side again.
No.
Brothers. Andrew. Move.
- What's happening?
- Prepare the net. John!
- Wake up.
- Philip. Brother.
Spread. Prepare the nets.
Cast.
- What happened?
- Heave.
- We're too shallow!
- We just did! We're stuck!
- Heave it. Hoist the net, Andrew.
- It's caught on something.
- It's fish.
- We're stuck on the bottom.
- We're not moving!
- It's fish.
It's fish.
It's fish!
Fish!
How did you know?
Faith!
Yeshua!
- It's him! It's him!
- Yeshua!
Yeshua!
Brothers.
It's him! It's him.
- Pass it.
- Thank you, Peter.
- Water?
- No, thank you.
Brother? Brother, water.
Did you know he would rise?
He said he would,
but, truth be told, we doubted it.
Then what made you follow him?
Leper! Go!
Get out of here!
Go!
Leper! Leper!
- Leper!
- Out!
- Get out!
- Out! Out!
Get out of here! Leper!
Leper!
He's going to do it.
Do what?
He's going to heal that man.
How?
Watch. Just watch.
No one touches me.
A miracle.
We saw them many times, Roman.
Do you have faith?
Come, stand.
Brothers.
That's why.
What do you search for?
Trouble. It will come.
This threatens them.
Pilate, Caiaphas and Rome.
Then there's trouble
this way as well.
Have faith, Tribune.
Peter, let's walk a little farther.
Why?
To be closer.
Simon, do you love me?
Yes. You know that I do.
- Do you love me?
- Yes.
- Simon, do you love me?
- With all my heart.
Then you must feed my lambs.
I don't even know what to ask.
Speak your heart.
I cannot reconcile all this
with the world I know.
With your own eyes you've seen,
yet still you doubt.
Imagine the doubt of those who have
never seen. That's what they face.
What frightens you?
Being wrong.
Wagering eternity on it.
Well, then,
know Him.
When you died,
I was present.
I helped.
I know.
What is it you seek, Clavius?
Certainty? Peace?
A day without death?
Wake up, brothers!
- Brothers, wake up. James, he's gone!
- Brothers, wake up, wake up.
- He's gone.
- What?
- Yeshua is gone.
- John, wake up!
- Brothers!
- Yeshua!
- Where is he?
- Come on, brothers.
- Where's he gone?
- Yeshua!
- Yeshua!
- Where is he?
- Yeshua!
- Yeshua!
- Yeshua!
- Brother!
Brothers.
I go to prepare a place for you.
Go...
into all the world and
preach the gospel
to all nations.
You will be my witnesses in Jerusalem
and all Judaea and Samaria
and to the ends of the earth.
And know that I
will be with you.
Always.
Lord?
It's not just about life eternal.
It's how life is lived,
by the sword or by love.
And it changes you here.
It's time.
Bye, brothers.
- That's actually rather good.
- It's beautiful.
I may use that again.
Amen.
Amen.
- Bye, brothers.
- Peace be with you, brothers.
Farewell.
Till the next time we
meet in his presence.
Goodbye, brother.
- Bless you, Peter.
- Farewell.
- Take care, brothers.
- Take care.
Farewell, brothers.
Join us, Tribune.
Jerusalem only bodes trouble.
Trouble and this spirit he promised. We
are called to receive it there, Roman.
Your call is to fish.
Aye, for men.
How can I do anything else now?
Will you fish, too, Clavius?
Then,
farewell, brother.
Farewell.
God bless and keep you.
I will always have you with me.
Always.
Peter, come!
Brothers!
Peter!
Brother!
Wait!
That way?
I doubt we'll ever
hear from them again.
Tribune?
My payment.
Tribune,
do you truly believe all this?
I believe
I can never be the same.
