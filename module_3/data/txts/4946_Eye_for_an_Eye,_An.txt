Ike! Let's go!
Cut out that damn crying.
I'll teach her.
Burn the outside!
Katy!
Bill!
Katy!
Howdy.
You're Mr. Talion, ain't ya?
I figured that I'd find ya here.
I come to do you a favor.
Of course it's got a price,
but I figured it's worth it to ya.
What are you talking about?
Well...
I know who done this...
I thought you'd like to know,
and that you'd be willing
to pay me a little...
something for the information.
Well...
Who did it?
Well...
For God's sakes...
you wouldn't
shoot an old man.
I know you're going to make
a real big splatter this close.
If you shoot me,
you never will know who done it.
Ike Slant...
and the Beetson brothers.
Where are they now?
I don't know.
I heard them talking
about how they done
this to get even with ya.
As God is my judge,
that's all I know,
that's all I know,
I don't know where they went.
I think you just better
get the hell out of here, mister.
Come on.
It's a real nice camp you got here.
It ain't ordinary,
a stranger walking up
on me like you just done.
Maybe you ain't ordinary.
Well, I...
I've been called a lot of things.
You didn't walk way out here?
No, that's...
That's right, I guess I didn't.
Dolly and my outfitter are
out there behind the brush.
You mind if we share
your camp with you?
Dolly?
Well, no.
No, I guess it'll be all right.
Well, good. I'll just
bring her in to meet ya.
Well, girl, it looks like
we got company for a change, huh?
I would like for you
to meet my friend Dolly.
Dolly, this is...
What did you say your name was?
Put her over there.
All right.
Can you shoot that thing straight?
Yeah. Straight enough.
You practice like
this every night, huh?
No.
Sometimes I get
it done earlier in the day,
but it always gets done,
one way or another.
That's a real fancy
rig you got there, boy.
I earned it.
I'll just bet you did.
Benny Wallace, huh?
Didn't expect the word
to travel so far.
Oh, word about bounty hunters,
that travels pretty far, pretty fast.
It will always beat you home, boy.
I have no home.
By the way, you haven't
told me your name.
My name is Talion.
Talion?
I've been waiting
a long time to meet you.
Are you sure?
I've done my share
of practicing, too, boy.
I never went in much
for an audience, though.
You ever notice a man gets
to the top of the heap,
there's always somebody
clamoring up to try and take his place.
Takes a little doin'.
Well, I don't guess you figure
anybody's got that much doin' in them.
You just turn around.
You'll get your chance.
What are you doing
in this territory anyway?
I'm just looking.
Why, I heard you quit
bounty hunting.
You getting a little
rusty, ain't ya?
Especially for Ike Slant
and them Beetson brothers.
Could be.
Ike Slant's a top gun.
A top gun, no.
No, Ike Slant is the top gun, boy.
He's smart. That's why
the Beetson brothers are his insurance.
You want to be smart?
You be my insurance...
I'll be yours.
You ain't getting no help from me.
No, you figure on taking
all three of them by yourself?
I ain't splitting that
reward money with nobody.
Oh, I figured we could...
decide on that after we get it.
Yeah.
Yeah, we could at that.
It's kinda hard to figure...
Talion needs help.
I just want to make sure
they all die, son.
Good night, boy.
I heard you've been known to get up
from the wrong side.
Dolly ain't got no wrong sides.
It just don't look right.
Draw, bounty hunter.
The wrong side, huh?
Come on.
You intend going in?
Might as well.
Could be they just circled around,
and that's where they're at.
Yeah, could be.
Let's not ask too many questions
when we get down there,
if they've been there, we'll know it.
There's one by that shack. Come on.
Hiya, stranger.
- Howdy.
- Howdy.
I'm Jo-Hi.
Well, Jo-Hi, who's
the big boss around here?
You're talking to him.
Oh, this is your place, huh?
Do you mind if we step down
and stretch our legs a little bit?
Not a bit of it.
You're welcome to.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Is there anybody
else around here?
Sure, my sister and my pa,
they work for me.
Yeah, well, I got an idea
you ain't easy to work for either, huh?
I'm fair.
You want to show us
around a little bit?
Sure, come in the house.
OK.
Howdy, ma'am.
Howdy.
Could I help you?
My name's Quince.
Brian Quince.
- Mr. Quince.
- Anchor, fur buyer,
calligrapher, Justice of the Peace,
et cetera, et cetera.
This is my daughter Bri,
and I see you've met the boss.
I'm Bill Tyler, Mr. Quince,
and this is my partner Bill Waters.
Oh, a couple of Bills, huh?
Say, it seems a might
peculiar, don't it?
Ah, don't let Dad scare ya.
I can handle him.
Oh, that's the way
the wind blows, is it?
If I were you, young fella,
I'd be mighty careful.
We don't get many young men
passing through here.
Say, you fellas must be hungry.
Yes, sir. We are.
Well, nothing much
happens around here,
and we kinda look
forward to mealtime.
Sometimes get to it a might early.
Bri, do you think maybe
you could warm up something now?
All right.
Say, uh, you fellas got business
in the territory?
Well, sir, my partner and me are...
kinda looking for new fields.
I thought we might
try a little mining.
I understand this is
the country for it here.
You ain't no miner.
Well, no, Jo-Hi.
Am I wrong?
Ah, you figure I'm too old to learn?
Well, there's a lot to learn.
Maybe you could learn me?
Not too good.
Running this post
takes about all my time.
Yes, and there's a lot of chores
to be done in the back room.
You're right. Plan to do
them tomorrow morning.
Well, if you want
to learn about mining,
I'll get you started.
Well, all right, what do I do?
I start my day's work at 5:30.
- Meet me out in the corral.
- I'll be there.
I better put a check on Bri.
Well, good.
How long you been working for him?
Ever since the day he was born.
Seems our new friends
have been accepted.
I gave you some on your birthday.
Yes, you did.
- More coffee?
- Yeah, I'll have some.
No thank you.
Jo-Hi.
Thank you.
Let me help, all right?
That's not like eating
on the trail, is it?
Well, good night.
Well, good night.
Oh, uh, Jo-Hi...
Thank you.
Yeah, thank you very much, Jo-Hi.
Thanks a lot.
Never knew Jo-Hi
to jelly bean strangers before.
Where'd he get
a name like Jo-Hi?
Oh, it's just how he is and
always has been so dang high and mighty.
Everybody's always
called him Jo-Hi.
Hey, it's time an old man
locked up and went to bed.
Bed sounds like a good idea.
Thank you very much, Miss.
You're welcome.
Mr. Quince...
Ike Slant, do you know him?
So, he is coming back.
My, he turned out bad, real bad.
Always knew he would.
Got a circular on him
just the other day.
Kind of thought
he'd be headed this way.
Good thing they put
you boys right on him.
You know, I could tell,
the way you handled your guns,
- you knew how to use them.
- Oh, yeah.
And, uh, keeping your badges
hid that way is a good idea.
Oh, I won't let on.
You boys federal?
Well, we're, um...
- Sort of...
- Oh, it doesn't matter.
Anybody but that old Duff
from Sortie Wells.
He was a good sheriff in his day,
but he ain't no match for Ike Slant.
Is this what you're looking for?
Why, yes.
I see Ike's traveling
with a couple of bad ones, too.
Yeah.
How soon you figure it'll be
before he gets here?
- Oh, he's here.
- You sure of that?
We tracked him all the way.
He's probably
going out to his old place.
Where's that?
Well, it's pretty much out of the way
from here... I could draw you a map.
We'd be obliged.
Here.
Now we're right here,
you cut across the flats
in this direction near Boulder Creek,
through Boulder Canyon.
Ike's place is right over here,
you just go right down here,
around, and come right up back of it.
Thank you very much, Mr. Quince.
You're welcome.
I'll, uh, bed the horses in.
Excuse me, I...
I didn't knock.
Could you tell me what time it is?
Right there.
Oh, there it is, yeah, well...
Say, that sure is
a beautiful clock.
Yeah, I hadn't noticed
that before, that...
That's a beautiful clock.
That's...
That's some clock, huh?
That's a good one.
Yes, yes, it is.
Oh, I'll bet that
keeps good time, too.
Oh, yes, yes, it does.
Yeah.
Well, good night then.
- Mr. Talion.
- Yeah.
That clock there, it...
it strikes on the hour,
and it's almost eight o'clock.
The chiming's lovely,
won't you stay and listen?
Yeah, I'd like to very much.
- Good.
- Can I help you?
Yes.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
Well, now...
How do you like Tillumuck?
Fine.
Tillumuck?
Oh, this valley, it's...
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah.
Named after an Indian chief.
Were you named after
an Indian chief, too?
Me? Of course not. Why?
Well, you got some pretty funny names
around here, you know, Jo-Hi,
and Tillumuck, and...
I've never meet
no Bris before either.
Well, I was supposed to be a boy,
called Brian after my father,
only the folks named
me Brianna, Bri for short.
You like it here?
Oh, I was born here.
So, you lived all your life in...
- Tillumuck?
- Tillumuck.
Yes, all my life.
Where's your home?
Well, I was...
Do you think that
you will be staying a while?
Well, I can't really say about that.
Bill, he's sort of
my partner, and...
You know, I'll have to hear
what he's got to say about that.
Where might you be going, then?
We've got some business
that's got to be done with.
Oh.
Maybe on the way back
I could stop by?
Maybe?
Well, it ain't a question
of not wanting to.
It's...
It's just that we
got to do something...
and then if I can, I'll come back.
You know, you really seem
old enough to do what you please.
Yes, sir, that is sure
some beautiful clock.
Well...
I think I better get to bed.
Thanks. The meal was fine.
Bill?
I... Well, good night.
Ms. Bri, I do want to come back.
Well, you'd be welcome.
Well, Mr. Bill, that's about all
I know about finding gold.
Well, thanks, Jo-Hi.
That gives me a good start.
Do you really want
to be a miner?
Well, I don't know.
It seems like a good idea.
- Not to me it don't.
- It don't.
What do you want to be
when you grow up?
Well, I don't know,
I'll just have to wait till I grow up.
Well, that's...
That will happen, Jo-Hi.
You don't have to rush that.
You know, Mr. Bill,
they ain't fooling me.
I don't really run this place at all.
Well, it appears to me you do.
Well, in some ways I do,
but they won't
even let me carry a gun.
A gun?
Sure, how are you going
to run anything without a gun?
Well, you don't need a gun.
What would you do
with one if you had it?
What do you do with yours?
Well, that's different.
I'm on the trail and everything.
I use mine... I shoot
rabbits and deer, you know, to eat.
You got a rifle
in your saddle for that.
Yeah.
Hey, I'll tell you what.
I'll whittle you
a make-believe gun.
I ain't gonna do no good
with a wooden gun.
No? I'm going
to whittle it so good
that only you and I will
know that it isn't real.
Can you make it that good?
Yeah, I can.
And only me and you will know?
Just us.
Ok? Now, mind you,
my partner Bill and I,
we have to leave today,
but when we get back,
I'll give you the gun, OK?
Let's get inside, it's cold.
Howdy.
Oh, by the way, Quince,
I saw Ike Slant with two strangers.
- Where?
- Up near Box Canyon.
You going to send Shorty Wells
for Sheriff Wilson?
Well, I could, Harry,
but that won't be necessary.
Let's get moving.
Well, we'll sure
drop by before long.
Will you really?
I will, anyhow.
Oh, I almost forgot.
I packed a lunch for you.
It's in on the table.
Oh, well, thanks.
Hey.
How did you know
we'd be leaving today?
Jo-Hi told me.
That's quite a boy.
Yes, he is.
He thinks you're quite a man.
I agree with him.
It'll take quite a man.
Yeah, I bet it will.
You...
put up a lunch for every stranger
that comes through town?
No, but I always figure
I'd know who to cook for.
We'll take a look at the ground
this game is going to be played on.
Box Canyon's up ahead.
Well, well, well, wrong side.
Just thought I'd see how it felt.
How did it feel, then?
All right.
- You pokin' fun at me?
- I wouldn't do a thing like that.
- So help me, Talion.
- You just stay loose, boy.
You got to learn
to laugh a little bit.
You've got plenty
of time to be serious.
Well, when that time
comes, you better be ready.
Ya see how ya are, boy.
You're always threatening me.
That ain't no threat.
Benny Wallace you're talking to.
Oh, yeah, bounty hunter, hm?
The number one bounty hunter,
what's your number?
Look, when I call you that,
I'm calling myself the same thing,
because I kill for money, too,
but I ain't gonna make up
any fancy names for it.
Let's get to it.
I don't see Slant.
Do you think we passed
him on the way in?
Let's take the Beetsons now
and wait for Slant down there.
- No.
- Why not?
Because Ike Slant spent
the first 20 years of his life
in this part of the country,
I bet he's got a dozen ways
to get out of this canyon,
and each one of them gives him
as good a look as we get right now.
If everything don't
look just right to him,
we'd have to go a long ways
to find him again.
We got company.
What would be your idea?
It appears to me that if we split up,
one of us come in
from them broken rocks on the right,
the other corners in
from that smooth flat rock on the left,
we'd have them in a pretty
good crossfire.
And then if we...
You got any idea
of taking them in alive?
No.
All right, then.
If we don't get them all
on the first crack,
they'd have to come by one
of us on their way out.
If their horses set up there
pretty close behind them,
I guess it'd be they'd high-tail it
out that ravine to the left.
You know, you could
live a long time.
I will.
It's time.
It's been a long ride, Ike!
I didn't think you'd ever find me.
You alone?
Don't bet on it.
Oh, I can't hardly believe that.
Believe it, Ike.
Well, now...
just who do you suppose
would be riding with you?
The name's Benny Wallace.
Talion.
I never 'spected to see you again.
I thought you'd hung up your guns.
I did, Ike...
but you put it back in my hand.
Ike, why my wife
and my boy, why not me?
Why?
I just wanted to give
you a little something
to live with for a while.
I'm going to give you something else
to live with for a little bit.
Remember that day that
we was waiting for you to come down?
I sort up struck up
a little friendship
with that wife of yours.
If I hadn't have burnt that cabin,
you would have found
a whole lot worse.
Make a run for it, boys.
I'll cover you.
Well, did you have a good sleep?
It's about time
you was coming to.
How long has it been?
It's been a couple of days.
A couple of days?
How come you're still here?
Our job ain't done yet.
I think Slant got away.
How are you feeling?
Outside of a headache, pretty good.
I ain't seeing just right yet.
You OK?
I got nicked a little bit.
Here, try some of my pot-hellion.
You'll either
see straight or go blind, huh?
My boots. What you
done with my boots?
All right. Take it easy.
I'll get your boots.
Think Slant went far?
I can't really tell.
When he gets to his feet
the way he did,
he certainly might be feeling
pretty good by now.
Well, why didn't you find out?
From all the blabber I heard,
it appears to me nothing
would stop you from finding out.
If that have been the thing to do, Ben,
I would have done it.
Now, as soon as you
gonna feel like moving,
we've got some money to pick up.
I'm ready.
All right, I'll hitch up the horses.
I can still saddle
my own horse, Ben.
Oh, sure.
Talion! Talion!
Whoa.
Benny, what's the matter?
I can't see out of...
Hold it, hold it,
take it easy. Take it easy.
All right, just calm down, kid.
It will pass, we got you
on your feet too soon.
Let me see if we can find a place
for us around here to camp.
Stand still and don't move.
Take hold of the shoulder.
Don't spook up, man.
Let's just walk.
We're going through some brush.
Come on.
Talion?
Talion?
Yeah. What is it, kid?
I thought you'd gone.
I'm not going to leave you, Ben...
not for a while, anyway.
I ain't forgetting.
You ain't forgetting what?
- You still looking to gun me?
- That's right.
All right, kid. It's time, get up.
You better go on alone.
I'll wait for you here.
Slant might come back.
I'll saddle your horse. I'll rig you in.
What do you think you're going to do?
Come and lead me, same as them?
Well, you ain't, not Benny Wallace.
Benny Wallace ain't going
to be led around like no blind man!
Look, boy, we play this thing right,
nobody needs to know anything.
I'll stick by you every second.
All you have to do is make out
like you can see as good as ever.
Now I'm not gonna let
anybody near ya.
When we get into town,
find a doc, fix you up.
Look, you sure you can
shoot for both of us?
I can shoot for both of us.
We're going on a walk,
close enough so you can
touch me anytime you want.
How about it?
Come on. All right?
- Whoa.
- We here?
Yeah, we're here.
Here. Hold the trim, boy.
All right, now we're going
to have to watch ourselves
when we sign
that deposition for the reward.
You just follow my lead.
Well, what are we waiting for?
I'm going to fix my saddle.
You just hold your horses now.
Well, is it all right?
Yeah, it's all right.
Now, just settle down.
OK, we got her.
Give that a try.
Let's go.
Well, howdy.
What have we got here?
Hi, Mr. Bill.
You got my gun?
My name's Talion.
This here's Benny Wallace.
I got two packages here,
worth just $500 apiece.
Charley and Jonas Beetson.
They're all yours.
How long will this take?
It won't take any longer
than we can help.
Anybody here recognize
the Beetson brothers?
I could.
It's them, all right.
I thought the Beetson boys
was traveling with Ike Slant.
You know, one of these days
you're going to know
more than you want to.
I'll send a telegram
for verification.
They'll authorize me to pay
if they're still worth anything.
You can come back
tomorrow morning.
Much obliged, Mr. Quince.
Is there a doc in town?
He come through from Marble,
twice a year.
I'm authorized to sign
death certificates.
OK, then, let's go.
Always heard Talion never wore
a glove on his gun hand.
I ain't got no love
for bounty hunters,
but I'd just as soon
they brought in Ike Slant, too.
He forgot my gun.
You get your mind
off of guns, son.
He lied to me, too.
I don't think he wanted to.
Never guessed a thing.
You did good, kid.
Do you think we'll be able
to pull it off tomorrow?
Well, tomorrow's going
to be tougher than today,
But we got this far.
We ought to get the prize.
I can't figure you out.
All you'd have to do
was just ride off,
and you could have
$1,000 for yourself.
Well, I didn't earn it by myself.
How long do you think you
can lead a blind man around?
Until that doctor
in Marble fixes you up,
I guess you're just going
to have to leave it to me, kid.
Come on, now.
Duck your head.
You sign that, and you can
take your money and clear out.
That will suit us fine.
Clearing out of places
is something we're used to.
Here, Ben, make your mark.
Here's your money.
All right, everybody.
How about a little party on us?
Come on, Benny. Let's go.
It's OK, kid. Let's go.
Mr. Talion.
- Mr. Talion.
- Get out of my way.
I expect you want to find
Slant before he finds you.
I can help.
You got something to say,
then say it.
How you going to get
the glove off fast enough?
You got any other problems?
Wallace signed like a blind man.
I know someone who would
like to hear about this.
What's he in such a rush about?
He's going to tell Ike Slant.
Tell him what?
Dad, Benny...
he can't even see.
Well, of course he can't see.
You think your dad's blind, too?
I'm going to warn them.
You're going to do
nothing of the kind.
What's the matter with you, girl?
You've been going on
here for years,
saying none of the young men around here
are good enough for you,
and now you take up
with a bounty hunter.
You got no call to warn anybody.
Dad, they can't protect themselves.
That's good. We'll be well off
with them two man killers out of here.
You'd just as soon
they had brought in Ike Slant.
That's true, but there's
the law to do that.
Oh, the law.
You won't even call in the sheriff.
The last thing he wants
to do is to face Ike Slant.
- We'll settle our own affair.
- Will we?
Bri, a good man just don't
hunt down other men to make a living.
Now, you get them two
out of your mind.
Their riding out of here
is the end of it for them.
It ain't for you.
Ike?
Ike? It's Trumbull, Ike.
Ike? Ike?
Hey...
I knew you'd come
to your old cabin, if'n you was able.
What do you mean, if I was able?
Look, Trumbull,
I know you pretty well,
and you ain't the least bit
concerned with my health,
so what's on your mind,
and how much is it going to cost me?
I thought you'd be interested
in knowing that Talion
and Benny Wallace brought
the Beetson brothers in... dead.
Get to the point.
Don't get excited.
You know, it's a long ride up here.
Long... cold ride.
Here. That ought to get you back.
Now, get to talking.
Like I said, they rode
into the trading post
with poor old Jonas
and Charley dead...
with the bounty.
But I knew all along
they didn't get you,
but you got them.
They're alive, ain't they?
They're alive...
but they ain't whole.
Talion's got no gun hand...
and Wallace is blind.
- Where they at?
- I don't know, Ike.
You get the rest of this
when you find Benny and Talion for me.
I'll find them.
I guess Slant knows
what's happening by now.
When are you going after him?
Well, you can handle Ike.
Why do you keep practicing for?
Well, you're Talion, ain't ya?
Well, I guess I ain't, kid.
- What?
- Not anymore.
Give me your hand.
Take it easy.
- Your gun hand?
- Yep.
You mean you were
supposed to be taking care of me,
and you can't even take
care of yourself?
Well, you're here, ain't ya?
Yeah, but how could you
take that kind of a chance?
That bounty money
may have to carry us for a long spill, kid.
What comes next?
I get Ike Slant,
that's what comes next.
Ike Slant's still good as ever.
We gotta get out of here.
Get out of here, where?
If I thought we had a chance
to make it to that doc in Marble,
we wouldn't be holding up here,
but we ain't got that chance.
Slant could gun us down
any place in between.
Now I've got to get him here.
You're crazy.
We can't stay here
and wait for him to slaughter us.
All right then! Get out!
- Go on!
- Stop it!
I'd give you my gun hand if I could.
Yeah, I know you would, kid.
Your hand and my eyes together, hm?
It might work.
You are crazy.
Probably, but I think we'd better find out.
Little bit more. Whoa.
Right there.
They way you're facing is 12 o'clock.
Just listen for my voice.
I'm going to 12 o'clock.
Now just listen for it.
I'm going to move around now.
You pick it up.
Three. Go.
That's five.
I tell ya, it won't work.
You haven't given it a chance, Ben.
Ain't nobody's going
to tell me when to draw.
It's foolish, anyway.
I don't know where to shoot.
It'll work. All you have to do
is keep the clock in your head, Ben.
That's all you see, is the clock.
That's all you're watching,
is the clock.
Let's try it again.
Remember, you've only
got ten points to hit
from five minutes before 12
until five minutes after 12.
The way you're facing is 12 o'clock..
I'm at 12 o'clock.
OK, now I'm going
to move around the clock,
You find me with your gun.
I'm moving from minute to minute.
Four.
Go!
That's better.
Two.
Go.
Take your time, kid.
58.
Wait for my go!
Just take your time.
Take your time, Ben.
Take it easy.
55.
Go.
And another thing,
we don't go unless we've
got our man on level ground.
Well, how do we make sure of that?
He'll come to us.
We'll have to pick the place.
Three.
Go.
Right here, right here.
Follow my voice.
That's 12. All right.
I'll tell you what, kid.
Let's take a rest.
- I hope we can...
- Now stop it. You're doing great.
- It just don't feel right.
- Never mind how it feels.
Just make sure you shoot straight.
It's the damn clock.
I can't see it.
Put your hand on my shoulder.
Now stick your right arm out.
Do you know where you are?
Not long ago you was one man
I had to prove myself against.
Now I'm depending on you for my life.
Well, there's a lot of things
we think we have to prove
that don't need proving at all.
Stick your right hand out.
Thank you.
How'd you get
to be a bounty hunter?
Well, I guess I was doing
some proving of my own.
It was a way of making a living,
staying on the right side of the ledger.
That ain't exactly what I mean.
- You know my story.
- I know your reputation.
Why, everybody knows it,
but you don't seem to be such a...
Such a what?
Such a killer?
You know what people are saying
about Benny Wallace?
We was talking about you.
Yeah, we sure was
talking about me, wasn't we?
Well, some kids are good
at breaking horses.
Other kids are good at farming.
I guess I was kinda quick with my hands.
Pa let me strap on his. 44 once.
When I was a kid, I did some practicing.
A couple of years later,
a man gave me a reason to use it.
Seems like somebody's
trying to lay me down ever since.
Where's it all come out, Talion?
Don't you know?
We better get back to practicing.
Stay still.
It's me, kid.
Somebody paid us a call.
Who was it?
I can't tell, but chances are before the
day's out, Ike Slant will know where we are.
We're going to have to break camp
and make another one.
I think I'm going to leave that clock.
It'll give Slant
something to think about.
Well, now ain't that a lot better?
Got ourselves a little privacy.
Bri?
Why don't you get me a bottle?
Well?
Here.
That's more like it, old man.
Well, what are you
yahoos a-gaping at?
Ain't you ever seen a man
have a drink before?
No, I reckon you ain't.
There ain't a man
in the whole bunch.
Why don't you bring me
my bottle, honey?
Ain't old Ike good enough for ya?
No!
You got a lot of spunk!
That's more than I can say
for the rest of this outfit.
Hey, what else do you know how to do?
A couple of things.
Ike, Ike, I seen Talion and Wallace.
- Where?
- About a mile south of here.
- How long ago?
- Yesterday.
I taken all day.
I went to your shack first.
Well, it looks like
I got a couple of things to do,
but don't worry, honey,
I'm going to be back.
All right.
Four.
Go.
Damn it! That's three, kid, not four!
I said four, not three. Four!
Well, why don't you try it?
Go ahead! Try it!
Yeah, I know it's tough.
Just get the picture of the clock
in your head. Just see the clock.
All right. One.
Go.
Pat Garrett Jr. Stubborn Pat.
What did you...
You looked in my boot.
You found out my name!
Crazy.
What the hell are you doing, kid?
Don't you never call me
Pat Garrett, you hear?
Never! Where are you?
Where are you?
What's the matter with you?
You out of your head?
- Don't call me that name.
- Why not? That's your name, ain't it?
Yes, it's my name.
It's my old man's name.
Pat Garrett, Sheriff, Fargo Wells.
Well, what's that got...
You got something
against sheriffs or something?
I made more money bringing in one man
than he does bringing in five.
And he says I'm wrong
for being a bounty hunter!
Oh, I see.
It could be he's right, kid.
How do you figure that?
I think he's got something
that you and I ain't never gonna have.
He's got one of these,
same as you and me.
Outside of that tin star of yours.
That tin star makes
all the difference in the world.
He's the law, kid.
You ain't ever gonna know
what that feels like.
I don't need to.
What did he get for killing Billy the Kid?
The most wanted man in the territory.
i50 bucks a month, that's what he got.
And he looks down on me.
Kicked me out for being a bounty hunter,
that's what he did.
Maybe inside you think he's right, huh?
Maybe that's why you got so sore
when I called you Pat Garrett Jr.
I told you not to call me that name.
I ain't gonna tell you no more.
Will you grow up?
If you don't like the name,
why do you wear it in your boots?
Ain't hardly nobody outside
of you knows my real name.
I kinda figured when it come
time to bury me I oughta...
Well, he is my father.
Hit in your marks.
You don't have to be
in so much of a hurry if you hit the marks.
Two. Go.
That's on it.
One. Go.
A little to the left,
but you would have had him.
Four. Go.
You were right on it, kid.
Come on.
Let's take a rest.
You keep it up just like you did,
right now we got nothing to worry about.
I'm wondering how this thing
will work in action?
Always seem to me,
what you don't expect is what you get.
Well, that works two ways.
Ike Slant is going
to get something he doesn't expect.
I'm going on in to Quince's.
I think it might be a little bit smart
for us to find out what Slant's up to.
You're probably right. Let's go.
Well, I'd like the company, kid, but I might
have to leave there in a little bit of a hurry.
I think I can do that better by myself.
You just keep out of sight.
I should be back by midnight.
- Don't push it too far.
- Not a chance.
- Talion.
- Yeah?
Why did Slant kill
your wife and boy?
When I was bounty hunting,
I picked up $500 for his kid brother.
Quince, pour me a drink.
Hey, where's that pretty ol' gal of yours?
You stay away from Bri, you hear?
I reckon that'll be up to me, won't it?
And the next time
you bring me any information,
you see it you get it here
in time to do me some good.
Now what's the matter?
I thought we was friends.
I ain't paying you to think.
Anyhow, I ain't too sure
you didn't warn them two fellas.
- I didn't even talk...
- Shut up.
Hey, you ain't sorry that they didn't
bring me in on that trail board
alongside of poor old
Charley and Jonas, are you?
Let me tell you
something, Trumbull.
There ain't nobody gonna
bring Ike Slant in.
Least of all a blind man and a cripple.
Now you listen to me, Ike. I want you
to get this straight right here and...
- Get out of here!
- All right.
I don't want your company!
What?
You tell your friend
that Benny and me
will meet him here
tomorrow at sundown.
T omorrow at sundown.
That's right, but I don't want
you to tell him right now.
When you leave here,
you walk straight away
from the trading post.
I can walk anywhere
you want me to walk.
Goodbye.
Talion!
- Talion, Talion.
- What are you doing here?
Well, I came to warn you.
He knows. Slant, he knows.
Well, you don't have to fight him.
You can't fight him.
Just calm down.
You ought to be
getting some sleep.
What was Trumbull doing here?
He's delivering a message for me.
Slant.
Talion, I know why
you feel the way you do,
and... I understand it.
Well, couldn't you forget it?
Couldn't you please forget it?
No, no.
It will all be over tomorrow, all right?
T omorrow.
Hey, kid, it's Talion.
Been gone a long time.
What happened?
- Slant's waiting for us.
- You saw him?
Yeah, at Quince's.
He didn't see me. He was too busy.
He was talking about a blind man
and a cripple, Ben.
- When?
- Tomorrow at sundown.
- At Quince's.
- At Quince's?
- You said he'd have to come to us.
- Yeah, he still will.
I better get some rest.
We'll leave about noon.
That will get us there on time.
I guess tomorrow
we'll wind things up one way or another.
We've been together
for quite a while now.
I figure if things go OK tomorrow,
we could stay together.
A while, anyway.
- Trumbull?
- What?
- What do you want?
- I got a little chore for you.
I don't understand you, Ike.
One minute you throw me out,
and the next minute
you got a chore for me.
There's a bonus in it.
Yeah? How much bonus?
300 in gold...
for nothing.
300 in gold...
for something.
What do I have to do
to lay my hands on that kind of money?
You know as well as I do
that they ain't gonna face me.
How can they?
It didn't seem like Talion was fooling.
Well, I hope he does show up.
I'll kill the both of them,
a couple of cripples.
I just want to show
this whole stinkin' town
just what I can do to them two.
I'll tell you what we'll do...
If they do happen to ride in here...
Is it about sundown?
Yeah, just about.
Talion, I'd...
I'd like to ride in, like I could.
Hell, yes, kid.
Put your hand out.
- All right?
- Yeah.
Let's go. Come on.
Duck your head.
Two riders.
It's them, all right.
- Why, they're crazy.
- They stopped.
Jo-Hi, here.
Stay under there, boy.
Quarter to your left.
Hold up.
The fence is right in front of you.
Just step down.
We're walking from here.
Don't draw before I say go.
I got to have time to get him
down on level ground.
You're sure you'll know
when he's going to draw?
Bad hand don't change
what a man knows.
I'll keep giving ya his position.
Don't get ahead of me.
I'll give you plenty of time.
Duck your horse's head.
Come along the corral fence
to your right.
Duck again. It's in the way.
Just walk to your right.
Turn to your left.
A little further.
Hold it.
That's your 12 o'clock.
Slant!
Bri, get away from the window.
Slant!
Where is he, Talion?
What's happening?
58 on the porch.
Well, you two cripples
gonna talk all day?
You made an awful mistake riding in here.
I'll guarantee ya,
you ain't gonna leave this town alive.
What's holding you back, boys?
59.
57.
55.
Don't move.
He's still on the porch.
How are you going
to get him down?
I'm not.
He'll make his own
mistake before long.
You two just going
to stand there?
He's coming down.
54.
52.
He's off your clock now.
Should we make a new 12?
Nah, he'll come back into it.
55.
58.
He's on 12.
One minute after.
Two.
He's got a notion.
No, not quite.
It's gonna be a real
pleasure killing you two.
A blind man and a cripple, Ike?
Yeah.
Two.
Benny... Go!
Jo-Hi!
No!
You all right, Mr. Talion?
Yeah, I'm all right, Jo-Hi.
Mr. Quince?
Will you take care of him for me?
For the marker, his name
is Pat Garrett Jr.
Talion?
Where are you a-going?
Bri, this gun killed my wife,
it killed my son,
it killed that boy over there.
It ain't gonna kill you, too.
Come here, Dolly.
- Mr. Talion!
- Yeah, Jo-Hi?
I want you
to stay, Mr. Talion,
but I guess you gotta go.
- Yeah, I guess I do.
- Did you forget my gun?
Yeah, I'm afraid I did, Jo-Hi.
Jo-Hi, come here.
The same as yours.
Yeah.
It's just littler.
