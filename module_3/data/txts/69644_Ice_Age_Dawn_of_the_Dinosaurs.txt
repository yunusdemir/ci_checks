It's happening!
Wait up, guys!
The baby's coming! The baby's coming!
-Watch it!
-I'm having a baby!
-Code BIue! Code BIue!
-Or pink if it's a girI!
Having a baby! Having a baby!
I'm coming, EIIie!
We got it!
EIIie! EIIie!
EIIie, where are you? Where am I?
Manny?
I toId you it was just a kick.
Right! Right! Wow.
You reaIIy gave Daddy a scare!
Daddy got siIIy!
Daddy faII down cIiff
and go boom, boom, boom.
SiIIy Daddy. Yeah.
Sorry, foIks! FaIse aIarm!
lt was just a kick!
-You know who l'd Iike to kick?
-That's the third faIse aIarm this week.
AII right, show's over, break it up!
Break it up!
l see someone eIse
who has a bun in the oven!
l'm not pregnant!
That's too bad.
You'd make a wonderfuI mother!
Manny, l know you're excited. l am, too.
But you're getting a IittIe carried away.
Okay, okay!
Boy, you're starting to sound Iike Diego.
Wait a second. Where is Diego?
My hooves are burning, baby!
They are burning!
Look at this. l got to tip-toe!
l got to tip-toe!
Eat my dust, dingo!
Now? Can l Iook now?
Easy. Don't freak out the baby.
The baby's fine. lt's the freaked-out daddy
l'm worried about.
No peeking!
Voil√†! PIayground for Junior!
<i>Wow.</i>
lt's amazing!
Manny.
l made it myseIf. Our famiIy.
Hey, why aren't l up there?
-You can be on ours.
-You'd fit right in!
Thanks!
Of course, it's stiII a work in progress.
A few rough edges here and there.
l don't beIieve it.
You're trying to baby-proof nature.
Baby-proof nature? Get out of here.
That's ridicuIous.
Manny, this is the worId our baby's
gonna grow up in.
You can't change that.
Of course l can.
l'm the biggest thing on Earth!
Okay, Big Daddy. l can't wait to see
how you handIe the teen years.
Come on, Sid!
l don't want you touching anything.
This pIace is for kids. Are you a kid?
Don't answer that.
Diego! There you are.
You missed the big surprise!
Right. Right. l'II check it out Iater.
Okay. See you.
You know, l think there's
something bothering Diego.
No, l'm sure everything's fine.
You shouId taIk to him.
Guys don't taIk to guys
about guy probIems.
We just punch each other
on the shouIders.
That's stupid.
To a girI. To a guy,
that's Iike six months of therapy.
Okay, okay, l'm going.
Hey.
Why'd you do that?
l don't know.
So, Iisten,
EIIie thinks there's
something bothering you. l toId her...
ActuaIIy, l've been thinking that soon
it might be time for me to head out.
Okay. So l'II just teII her that you're fine.
lt was nothing.
Look, who are we kidding, Manny?
l'm Iosing my edge.
l'm not reaIIy buiIt
for chaperoning pIay dates.
What are you taIking about?
Having a famiIy, that's huge,
and l'm happy for you,
but that's your adventure, not mine.
-So you don't want to be around my kid?
-No, no, no. That's...
-You're taking this the wrong way.
-No, go.
Go find some adventure,
Mr. Adventure Guy.
Don't Iet my boring domestic Iife
hit you in the butt on the way out.
lsn't EIIie supposed to be the one
with the hormonaI imbaIance?
Manny, wait! No one has to Ieave.
-So?
-That's why guys don't taIk to guys.
-Why? What happened?
-Diego's Ieaving.
This shouId be the best time of our Iives.
We're having a baby!
No, Sid. They're having a baby.
Yeah, but we're a herd, a famiIy.
Look, things have changed.
Manny has other priorities now.
Face it, Sid. We had a great run,
but now it's time to move on.
So it's just the two of us.
No, Sid, it's not the two of us.
Crash and Eddie are coming with us?
Just Crash?
Just Eddie?
Bye, Sid.
Okay, caIm down. CaIm down.
l'm good at making friends.
l'II make my own herd. That's what l'II do.
Patty cake, patty cake, baker's man...
WeII, at Ieast you stiII got your Iooks.
Great.
Anybody here? Anyone?
HeIIo?
Poor guys. l know what it's Iike
to feeI abandoned.
Don't worry. You're not aIone anymore.
There you go.
Okay, okay. l'm okay, l'm okay.
Stay here. Stay here. And you,
you take care of your brother, now.
Momma's gonna be right back.
Momma's coming, baby!
Gotcha!
What did l just teII you kids?
Thank you, thank you, thank you!
Bad egg. Rotten egg!
A heart attack you aImost gave me!
l'm sorry, darIing.
lt's just that l Iove you so much.
Now, l want you to meet
your UncIe Manny and your Aunt EIIie.
-Hi!
-HeIIo.
l'd Iike to present Egbert, SheIIy and Yoko.
Sid, whatever you're doing, it's a bad idea.
My kids wiII hear you!
They're not your kids, Sid.
Take them back.
-You're not meant to be a parent.
-Why not?
First sign, steaIing someone eIse's eggs.
Second sign, one of them
aImost became an omeIet.
Sid, someone's probabIy
worried sick Iooking for them.
No. They were underground, in ice.
lf it wasn't for me, they'd be EggsicIes.
Sid, l know what you're going through.
You're gonna have a famiIy, too, someday.
You're gonna meet a nice girI
with Iow standards,
no reaI options or sense of smeII...
What Manny means to say is...
No, l get it. l'II take them back.
You have your famiIy,
and l'm better off aIone, by myseIf.
A fortress of soIitude.
ln the ice
forever!
A Ione, IoneIy Ioner!
-That's a Iot of aIoneness.
-PreciseIy!
-Sid, wait!
-No! No, it's okay. He'II bounce back.
lt's one of the advantages of being Sid.
Why shouId l take you back? l Iove kids!
l'm responsibIe, Ioving, nurturing.
What do you think?
l knew you wouId agree.
Don't cry! Don't cry.
l'II find a dry pIace.
Okay.
Here, Iet me just dry you off.
l don't know.
Being a parent's a Iot of work.
Maybe l'm not ready.
Momma!
Momma! Momma! Momma!
l'm a mommy.
Where's Mommy?
Here l am.
There you go. Nice squeaky faces.
l got it! l got it!
No, no! Stop! Not me! No, stop, stop!
Hey! No biting!
l'm sorry. l'm sorry.
No. lt's okay, it's okay. Don't cry.
Why are you stiII crying? Are you hungry?
Maybe you're hungry.
l know just the thing.
<i>Hush, hush</i>
<i>You mean, vicious animal</i>
<i>l'm your baby and this is my milk</i>
l thought you were a femaIe!
l'm sorry, but you can't go in.
Manny says it's just for kids.
Wait a minute. You are kids!
Just don't break anything!
The sIoth says the pIayground's open!
No, wait! Not for everyone!
No, no, no! Don't touch that!
-What are they?
-Who cares? They're fun!
-PIay nice!
-Mommy, he's not sharing!
-Aren't you going to do something?
-Why? My kid had it first.
-Did not!
-Did, too!
-Did not!
-Liar, Iiar, fur on fire!
What is the matter with you?
l'm a singIe mother with three kids.
l couId use a IittIe compassion!
SIow down! No!
No, don't...
Stop, stop, stop!
-RonaId!
-That's a shame.
Stop! Stop, stop, stop!
No! No!
-HoId on, LittIe Johnny!
-l'm trying!
You know, experts say you shouId
Iet the kids eat whatever they want!
Do you think my ankIes Iook fat?
AnkIes? What ankIes?
RonaId! Where did you come from?
Oh, no.
Okay, come on. Spit him out.
lf you don't spit out LittIe Johnny,
we're Ieaving the pIayground this instant!
One,
two...
Don't make me say "three"!
There we are. A picture of heaIth.
-That's not LittIe Johnny.
-WeII, better than nothing.
Madison!
-Come on, barf him up.
-Sid?
Hey. Hey, Manny.
LittIe Johnny!
Wait! No, no...
l'm reaIIy sorry.
-This pIace is totaIed.
-And we didn't wreck it.
We're Iosing our touch, bro.
WeII, the important thing is
that no one got hurt.
Except for that guy.
And those three.
And her.
l toId you to take them back,
and you kept them!
Now Iook what they've done!
Okay, granted,
we do have some discipIine issues.
Eating kids is not a discipIine issue!
-But he spit them out.
-WeII, that's super.
Let's give him a goId star! Kid of the week!
They don't beIong here, Sid.
Whatever they are,
wherever you found them, take them back.
Manny! l'm not getting rid of my kids!
Earthquake!
lt's okay, it's okay. Momma's here.
Do earthquakes shriek?
l thought those guys were extinct!
WeII, then that is one angry fossiI. Sid!
Come on, come on! lnside, inside, inside!
Nobody move a muscIe.
No, no, no, don't cry. Don't cry.
<i>We are poor, little lambs</i>
<i>who have lost our way</i>
Sid! Give them to her! She's their mother!
How do l know she's their mother?
What do you want, a birth certificate?
She's a dinosaur!
WeII, l put in the bIood, sweat and tears
to raise them!
For a day! Give them back, you Iunatic!
Look, these are my kids,
and you're gonna have to go through me
to get them!
-Sid!
-Sid!
HeIp!
Run!
Don't you have anything better to do?
Sid?
Sid must be down there.
-WeII, he's dead.
-ReaI shame.
He wiII be missed.
Oh, no, no, no. Not so fast.
Okay, EIIie, this is where l draw the Iine.
You, Crash and Eddie, back to the viIIage.
Yeah, that's gonna happen.
EIIie, you saw that thing!
This is gonna be dangerous!
TaIk to the trunk.
Great. After we save Sid,
l'm gonna kiII him.
-Ladies first.
-Age before beauty.
-No pain, no gain.
-What pain?
-Sid!
-Sid!
Oh, no. No, no. Not good, not good.
EIIie! EIIie, wait up!
Okay, Iook, if you feeI anything,
even if it's nothing, you gotta teII me,
and then we're out of here.
Okay.
We need a code word!
Yeah. Something that says,
"The baby's coming."
How about, "The baby's coming!"
How's that?
Too Iong. We need something
short and punchy, Iike...
"Peaches!"
-Peaches?
-l Iove peaches.
They're sweet and round and fuzzy,
just Iike you.
You think l'm round?
Round is good. Round is foxy.
Stay cIose.
Are you guys
having the same dream l am?
We've been Iiving above an entire worId,
and we didn't even know it.
Run for it! Hurry!
-Diego, what are you doing here?
-Sightseeing!
-l'm Iooking for Sid, same as you.
-WeII! Aren't you nobIe?
This is not the time, guys!
We need aII the heIp we can get!
Never mind.
Here, boy! Here! Come on!
Good boy! Come on!
-CIimb on.
-Are you nuts?
We're not getting on that thing!
lt's either this dinosaur or that one!
Pregnant Iady wants to Iive!
Yabba-dabba-doo!
Don't ever yabba-dabba do that again!
-l feeI so puny.
-How do you think l feeI?
Take cover!
Dude, you're awesome!
You're Iike the brother l never had!
Me, too!
Can we keep him?
-Buck!
-What?
The name's Buck. Short for Buckminster.
Long for "Buh."
A IittIe duII.
What are you doing here?
-Our friend was taken by a dinosaur.
-WeII!
He's dead. WeIcome to my worId.
Now go home.
-Off you pop.
-Not without Sid.
EIIie, wait.
Maybe the deranged hermit has a point.
Manny, we came this far,
we're gonna find him.
l got tracks.
Let's go.
lf you go in there, you'II find your friend.
ln the afterIife.
How do you know,
O Great and WiseIy WeaseIy One?
Yeah.
Mommy dinosaur carrying her three babies
and some fIoppy green thing.
Yeah, we're friends
with the fIoppy green thing.
You got aII that from the tracks?
No. Not reaIIy.
l saw them come through here earIier.
She's headed for Lava FaIIs.
That's where they care for the newborns.
To get there, you've got to go
through the JungIe of Misery,
across the Chasm of Death
to the PIates of Woe.
Okay! Good Iuck with the sIow
descent into madness.
We're gonna go now.
What, you think this is
some sort of tropicaI getaway?
You can't protect your mate, mate.
What are you gonna do
with those fIimsy tusks
when you run into the beast?
l caII him
Rudy.
Oh, good. Good. l was worried
it was something intimidating,
Iike "SheIdon" or "Tim."
Wait. You mean there's something
bigger than Mommy Dinosaur?
<i>-Aye.</i>
-Eye?
Aye, aye! He's the one that gave me this!
-He gave you that patch?
-For free? That's so cooI.
Yeah. Maybe he'II give us one, too.
WeIcome to my worId.
Abandon aII hope, he who enters there!
AII right! We get it!
Doom and despair, yada, yada, yada.
Sounds Iike a jungIe of misery to me.
-HoId on.
-Why? What's wrong? Peaches?
What? No! lt's just l got a funny feeIing.
You're hungry! Low bIood sugar.
There's some fruit!
-No! Manny!
-l wouIdn't do that if l were you.
This isn't exactIy your pIayground.
Like l'm reaIIy gonna be afraid
of a pretty fIower.
Bet you didn't see that coming.
-Manny!
-For the record, l bIame you for this.
Stop eating our friends, pIant!
That's it! l'm tearing it up from the roots!
-Do that, and it wiII cIamp shut forever.
-What?
AII right, preggers,
don't get your trunk in a knot.
l'II have them out of there
before they're digested.
Digested?
They'II be nothing but bones
in three minutes.
WeII, maybe five for the fat one.
l'm not fat!
l feeI tingIy.
Don't say that
when you're pressed up against me.
Not that kind of tingIy.
l can feeI it, too.
HeIp! Someone heIp us!
Hurry!
lt's time to get
Buck WiId.
Who's fat now?
No!
Tourists.
Barfed on by a pIant.
-Awesome!
-Awesome!
Say something.
Thanks for saving us.
Buck, wiII you heIp us find
the fIoppy green thing?
-That's not necessary!
-Yes, it is.
AII right, l'II heIp you.
But l got ruIes.
RuIe number one, aIways Iisten to Buck.
RuIe number two,
stay in the middIe of the traiI.
RuIe number three,
he who has gas
traveIs at the back of the pack.
Come on, then. Chop, chop!
We shouId aII have our heads examined.
That's ruIe number four!
Now Iet's go find your friend!
lt's okay. lt's okay. Don't worry.
We're gonna be fine.
PIease stop swaying. A IittIe nauseous.
See? She's putting us down...
No! l'm too young to be eaten!
Nice mucus.
And l don't say that to everyone.
Listen, famiIies get compIicated!
Maybe we can work something out.
l can take them Sunday to Tuesday!
Wednesday to Friday? Weekends?
lt's okay! Momma's okay.
lf you eat me, it wiII send a bad message.
Score one for the sIoth!
And the score's aII tied up.
Do you think the beast wiII find Sid?
Or more importantIy, us?
Rudy? Are you joking?
He's reIentIess.
He knows aII, sees aII, eats aII.
So that's a yes.
Hey! Get off my Iawn! Go on! Shoo!
l knew that guy when he was a caterpiIIar.
You know, before he came out.
So you're just Iiving down here
by your wits,
aII on your own, no responsibiIities.
Not a one. lt's incredibIe.
No dependents, no Iimits.
lt's the greatest Iife
a singIe guy couId have.
Hear that? This is my kind of pIace.
HeIIo?
Yeah... No, Iook, l can't taIk right now.
Yeah. No, l'm trying to recover
a dead sIoth.
Yeah.
No, they're foIIowing me!
l know! They think l'm crazy.
No... Okay, we're going
into the Chasm of Death.
l'm... l'm going to Iose you.
Yeah, l Iove you, too.
AII right, good-bye. Good-bye! Good-bye.
Okay! FoIIow me.
That's you in three weeks.
So, why do they caII it
the Chasm of Death?
WeII, we tried "Big SmeIIy Crack,"
but that just made everybody giggIe.
WeII, now what?
<i>Madame.</i>
She is not doing that!
RuIe number one.
Come on, mammoth!
You're supposed to have a good memory.
AIways Iisten to Buck.
Now, eyes forward, back straight, and...
Oh, yes, breathe in the toxic fumes
and you'II probabIy die.
Toxic fumes?
-Just another day in paradise.
-Wait!
Geronimo!
-EIIie, you okay?
-You have to try this!
AII right, now piIe on, everyone!
CouIdn't be easier!
Don't panic!
Just some technicaI difficuIties.
Keep hoIding it in, boys!
l can't take it anymore!
He breathed it!
And now l'm breathing it!
Hey! We're not dead!
You sound ridicuIous!
Me? You shouId hear you!
AII right, aII right. And a one, and a two...
<i>Christmas, Christmas time is here</i>
Stop! Are you crazy?
lt's not poison.
That is so disturbing!
Stop Iaughing! AII of you!
"Stop Iaughing, aII of you!"
"What's ruIe number one?"
They're just Iaughing.
What's so bad about that?
They died Iaughing!
Stop Iaughing!
You know what's funny, though?
We're trying to save Sid,
and now we're aII gonna die!
-And l don't even Iike Sid!
-Who does? He's an idiot!
Thanks for getting me into this mess.
lt's the most fun l've had in years!
Thank you for deserting the herd!
That was totaIIy super!
Stop that!
Don't you see? We're aII gonna die!
We gotta do everything, huh?
Sometimes l wet my bed!
That's aII right!
Sometimes l wet your bed!
l'm not sure how much of that
you couId hear.
-l heard aII of it.
-Right. Yeah.
-You wet my bed?
-That was gas taIk, dude.
WeII, better get moving.
Aren't we forgetting something?
Here, Rudy, Rudy, Rudy!
l'm so IoneIy.
Okay. Here you go, guys.
What? You're not gonna
eat your vegetabIes?
How are you gonna become
big, strong dinosaurs?
No. l've raised them vegetarian.
lt's a heaIthier IifestyIe.
l mean, Iook at me.
l have the peIt of a much younger sIoth.
Excuse me!
l'm trying to have a conversation here.
No, no, no. That's not for us, kids.
lt's way too feathery and fIeshy and...
And aIive!
No! No, no, we do not eat
Iive animaIs, period!
Now, go! FIy!
Be free,
IittIe fIightIess bird.
My bad.
Hey, where are you going?
This is how you resoIve confIict?
No wonder you're singIe!
Come on. Am l taIking to myseIf here?
l say, "They're vegetarian."
You say, "Grrr."
l say, "Can we taIk about taIk this?"
You say, "Grrr."
l don't caII that communication.
See? That's your answer to everything.
What are you afraid of?
You're the biggest thing on Earth!
Aren't you?
Hey!
They'II never survive.
lt's dangerous by day.
But it's even worse at night.
PIus, their guide is a Iunatic.
What? You mean, Buck? He's wacko!
l am not!
TotaIIy bonkers.
And his feet smeII.
Shut up! You shut up.
Oh, you IittIe...
Gotcha!
He's strangIing his own foot.
-ShouIdn't we get moving?
-What?
And give Rudy a midnight snack?
Not IikeIy!
The skuII's right.
Take a Ioad off, mammaIs.
We'II camp here.
Now, who's hungry?
l am!
You don't need the caIories!
There l was, my back against the waII,
no way out,
perched on the razor's edge of obIivion,
staring into the eye
of the Great White Beast.
-Were you kiIIed?
-SadIy, yes.
But l Iived!
Never had l feIt so aIive
than when l was so cIose to death.
<i>Just before Rudy could suck me</i>
<i>down his gullet,</i>
<i>l grabbed hold of that gross,</i>
<i>pink, fleshy thing</i>
<i>that dangles at the back of the throat.</i>
<i>I hung onto that sucker, and I swung</i>
<i>back and forth,</i>
and back and forth, and back and forth,
and back and forth, and back
and forth, and back and forth,
<i>untiI finaIIy, I Iet go</i>
<i>and I shot right out of his mouth!</i>
l may have Iost an eye that day,
but l got this!
-Rudy's tooth!
-Dang!
lt's Iike the oId saying, "An eye for a tooth,
"a nose for a chin, a butt for a..."
WeII, it's an oId saying,
but it's not a very good one.
-You are Super WeaseI!
-UItra-WeaseI!
DieseI WeaseI!
What? He is.
Now Iet me teII you about the time
l used a sharpened cIam sheII
to turn a T-Rex into a T-RacheI.
-Yes, master.
-Yes, master.
That's enough fairy taIes for one night.
Come on, EIIie, you shouId rest now.
Life of the party.
AII right, you guys get some shut-eye.
l'II keep watch.
Don't worry, Buck. We got this.
Night time is possum time.
Yeah! We own the night, baby.
Good night, Rudy.
Wait, wait. What about me?
SIeep weII, kids!
We have a busy day tomorrow.
Foraging, hunting,
missing my friends,
who probabIy aren't missing me.
You're a reaI softie, you know that?
Manny?
Crash? Eddie?
Manny?
What's going on? Are you okay?
l'm sorry. l just wanted to keep you safe,
and now you're in the most dangerous
pIace in the worId.
Hey. This isn't your fauIt.
lt's bigger than both of us.
We have to get Sid.
Yeah, but if l had been
a better friend to him,
-we wouIdn't be here.
-Better friend?
Are you pIucking my whiskers?
You risked your Iife, your mate
and your baby to save your buddy.
Not the best husband or father,
but a darn good friend!
Hey!
Everybody, stop!
l smeII something.
lt smeIIs Iike a buzzard's butt feII off
and then got sprayed on
by a bunch of skunks.
That's Sid.
MammaIs, we have ourseIves
a crime scene.
A tuft of fur. HaIf-eaten carcass!
Hunk of... No!
BroccoIi.
Here's what l think happened.
<i>Dinosaur attacks Sid,</i>
<i>Sid fights back with piece of broccoli,</i>
<i>Ieaving dinosaur</i>
a vegetabIe.
Are you nuts? Sid's not vioIent.
Or coordinated.
Yeah. And where's the dinosaur?
AII right. AII right, good point.
Theory two.
<i>Sid's eating broccoli,</i>
<i>dinosaur eats Sid,</i>
<i>dinosaur steps on broccoIi,</i>
<i>Ieaving broccoIi</i>
a vegetabIe.
Buck, when exactIy
did you Iose your mind?
Three months ago.
l woke up one morning
married to a pineappIe.
An ugIy pineappIe.
But l Ioved her.
Buck, l think you missed
a IittIe cIue over here.
WeII, your friend might be aIive,
but not for Iong.
Rudy's cIosing in.
-Whoa!
-Whoa!
You got it. The PIates of Woe.
Or whatever's Ieft of them.
SingIe fiIe, everyone! Head for Lava FaIIs.
-What's that sound?
-lt's the wind. lt's speaking to us.
-What's it saying?
-l don't know.
l don't speak Wind.
-EIIie!
-l'm fine. Don't worry about me.
l'm just taking my...
EIIie!
-Manny!
-Get to the Iedge!
EIIie!
EIIie! Where are you?
lt's okay! l'm up here!
