Shit!
Oh, God!
- What time did you get back?
- You don't want to know.
Was it worth it?
Did he sign the contract?
- Yes.
- What a genius. How did you do it?
I did it the old-fashioned way.
I begged.
Good morning, Roy and Mary.
What time's my doctor's appointment?
I had no idea you had one.
- Coffee, Roy?
- Yeah. Are you sick?
- A wolf bit me.
- I just asked.
- Are you going to Alden's party?
- Probably.
He invites everybody over to let
them know if they still have a job.
You have no appointment.
But he'll see you before 12.
If you get the axe tonight,
I go with you.
- So do I.
- Listen, you need your pay cheques.
I forbid you to take any action
if I'm fired.
Right. Maude Waggins
is waiting in your office.
I cannot write for a conglomerate.
Protect me.
Raymond Alden isn't a conglomerate,
he's a billionaire.
And I'm not sure if I'm going
to be here after the takeover.
You're the senior editor.
Your name, your reputation...
My reputation has been in question
ever since I told Judith Krantz -
- that no 14-year-old
would read her fiction.
- Bullshit!
- Sit down. Maude.
The good news is that the head of
marketing is my friend and protégé.
If I leave. He'll leave with me.
I know they don't want to lose him.
That may give me some leverage.
I'll leave with you, too!
How’s that for leverage?
Let's go and see your protégé.
Willie.
Just the man I wanted to see.
Maude Waggins.
You saved my life. While reading
"What About Us Girls?"...
- You realized you had to write.
- No, I stopped.
I realized that if this was talent.
I had none.
- How nice that it should stop you.
- I adore you.
- I taught him to do that.
- I used to hit my authors.
Maude wants in if we leave. Do you
know what her contract calls for?
She's obligated to one more book.
We get first look at her next two.
How about an 80-page reminiscence
of all the restaurants I've loved?
There are no specifications
in the contract.
I'll start eating out right now.
You are a rarity. A loyal man,
with a great taste in authors.
Bye, Will. I'll see you at Jason's.
You're such a polished ass-kisser
it takes my breath away.
I kiss 'em like I see 'em.
A wolf in Vermont.
I don't think so. Will.
You weren't there.
You sure it wasn't a husky?
After all. It was dark out.
There was a full moon.
It was a wolf.
I was staring straight at it.
You don't confuse a dog with a wolf.
I see. Funny, this isn't the first
rabies shot I've given recently.
My wife's sister-in-law in Oneonta,
a raccoon bit her in the ass.
My friend's son sustained
brain damage from a snake bite.
He was by the pool,
next thing he has brain damage.
- Is he all right?
- No, you idiot, he's brain damaged.
I see Time-Warner
as a bunch of decent caring people.
Money doesn't always imply
ruthless ambition. Am I insane?
I would say so, yes.
He's so charming.
Because the rainforest
is being destroyed so rapidly, -
- all these viruses
are going to colonize the world.
They'll kill off the population.
I'm only quoting "The New Yorker".
Everyone's trying to say the world
will end if we have no rainforests.
You could make a case that the world
has already ended. That art is dead.
Instead of art we have
pop culture and daytime TV.
Women who've been raped by
their dentists confiding in Oprah.
An exploration in depth of why women
cut off their husbands' penises.
- Time to fill up the glass.
- Yes. Let's have a drink.
Relax. Eat something.
At least get a meal out of this.
I didn't like the food.
All that red meat dripping blood.
- You're fun to eat with.
- Mr. Alden would like to see you.
"Never send to know for whom
the bell tolls. It tolls..."'
Will... just remember who you are.
Charm him. You can be charming
when you want to.
- Why is he doing it this way?
- It's kinder face-to-face.
- Cigar?
- Don't mind if I do.
I want you to think about Europe.
Eastern Europe, particularly.
There's a whole new market
opening up there.
God and currency willing,
the entire continent will cohere.
Both economically and culturally.
I want that to be your area.
I see...
Then my area will no longer be
editor-in-chief after the takeover?
There's nothing personal,
you know that.
You're clearly a man
of taste and individuality.
But these days,
all around the globe, -
- taste and individuality
are actually a handicap.
Then what of my successor?
Is he a vulgar conformist?
Drive. Hustle. Drive
and 52-carat ambition.
He nagged me day and night
until I gave him your job.
Well. For what it's worth. Here's
what I've learned in 30 years:
Treat the authors as human beings.
Don't stint on review copies.
Don't hold them to deadlines.
They'll only turn in rough drafts.
Thank you, I'll remember that.
You're a nice person, Will.
Thank God I replaced you.
I hope you give
Eastern Europe a shot.
You'd better put that out.
Horses don't like it.
- I think I'll finish it.
- Go ahead. Good cigar, isn't it?
This is the prize. Fort Knox.
Drink it.
Good boy.
I'm afraid I...
finished your drink.
What are you?
The last civilized man?
I'm...
...just embarrassed.
Half the people here use Thorazine,
so a little anxiety is okay.
- You're very kind.
- No. I'm not.
I'm Laura Alden. Alden is my father.
- I'm Will Randall.
- Nice to meet you.
- You don't seem surprised.
- Not tonight.
- He just fired you, didn't he?
- Demoted is the word.
I have a choice between no job
and a job no one would want.
- What will you do?
- Take the job no one would want.
I don't have the courage
to be jobless at my age.
Old guy?
Yeah... Old guy.
Well... I'd better get back.
Was that on purpose?
No... You're perfectly safe.
I'm married.
- And that makes you perfectly safe?
- Yes...
You better clean yourself up
if you're gonna face the crowd.
Here, wipe your face.
It's all sweaty.
There you are, dear.
All ready for company.
Thank you.
How did it go?
Speak, we've been going nuts.
First, let me say congratulations
on being the new editor-in-chief.
What...? Alden said that?
What did he say?
He called this evening and told me
he wanted me to take the job.
I said that it was your job.
I didn't know if he was serious.
I didn't ask for this.
Say the word, I'll turn it down.
- What should I do?
- That's up to you, Stewart.
No, it's up to you.
I'll do whatever you say.
You're asking the one person
who can't advise you.
Shit! I'm sorry you said that.
That son of a bitch! Prick!
I had no idea
he was offered your job.
Alden must have made a good offer,
but he could have told you.
Why didn't you say something?
You let him walk away guilt-free.
Charlotte, please...
I can't talk now.
May I just say
one more thing about it?
No.
Will. Come on. It's 7:30.
Give me till eight.
Will?
It's 7:40.
I asked you to give me till eight.
It's 7:40 at night, you dope.
You've slept all day.
Are you all right?
How do you feel?
I feel...
...good.
I said, "Why assign me mastectomies
and estrogen therapy?"
"Let me do genetic engineering.
Give Pete mastectomies."
You know what he said? "You'll do it
so much better, you're a woman."
I said, "That's like telling
a black food-writer..." Hey!
I have to catch up.
I haven't eaten. I haven't drunk.
I haven't made love in a long time.
A very long time.
Do you think we ought to do it
right here in front of the church?
- What else do you do without hands?
- You'll see.
What was in that stew?
- Good morning.
- It's a bit early to be drinking?
- How the fuck did you know?
- You can smell it a mile away.
- Mr. Randall, are you all right?
- Perfectly.
I heard about Alden's decision.
I'm so sorry.
- Was Stewart just in here?
- Not just. About an hour ago.
That's how I found out.
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
- I want to say I think it sucks.
- Thank you, Roy.
What did you do, get contacts?
I'll be damned...
You've edited about 60 pages
since Monday. What are you on?
Nothing.
I just caught up on my sleep.
I got 20 hours of sleep
and I feel 20 years younger.
And so now
you can see without your glasses?
Yeah, you've got a point.
You know what he said?
"How could you drink this early?"
I put some tequila in my coffee
and he said he smelled it.
- Alden replaced Randall.
- Are you sure?
It's official. Will Randall's out
Stewart Swinton's in.
Get me Gary on the phone.
- A manual on owning animals?
- No. Animal possession.
Demonic possession.
Possession of the spirit by animals.
Give me a minute.
- How many do you want?
- One, the most respectable.
Vijav Alezais
wrote "Something Wild" in 1948.
- Old but breathing.
- He's not some kind of mystic?
No. He has letters after his name.
In fact. He's Doctor Alezais.
Thank you.
Give his number to Mary, please.
And, Gary, don't tell people
you had tequila with your coffee.
You didn't have coffee
this morning.
Hi, I made it to New Haven.
I'll be home tomorrow.
If you get hungry,
there's some left over stew.
Let's see if it still works,
you animal!
- Yes?
- It's Will.
I'll come down.
Hey, Will. What's going on?
What is it?
What's wrong?
What did he...
I'm sorry.
I'll get dressed.
- Good morning, Mr. Randall.
- I've moved to the Mayflower.
- Is that permanent?
- Yes.
Call legal and find out
if the deal with Alden is closed.
Get Roy to come over with a list of
every author he's ever worked with.
And a list of every author
I've ever worked with.
Call Alden and get me
an appointment this afternoon.
Is the worm turning?
- The worm is now packing an Uzi.
- It's about fucking time.
Shall I resign today? Promise
never to see Charlotte again?
- Just tell me what to do.
- Resign today.
I can't do that.
So why did I say it?
I guess it's just a way
of telling you...
...how bad I feel
about being such a shit.
I love you, Will.
I know how that sounds. But I do.
I know how much I've hurt you
and it kills me.
I know I can't...
- You'll never forgive me, will you?
- No.
I'd still like one thing.
Your permission to call Alden and
tell him to forget Eastern Europe.
To keep you on as a consultant.
May I do that for you?
I'm gonna get you, Stewart.
The deal is not officially closed.
Mr. Alden will see you at 12:30.
Roy, ask your list of authors about
forming a publishing partnership.
Tell them
we're leaving MacLeish House, -
- whose new policy is to bury
everything that doesn't sell.
- Tell them we've got investors.
- Two things.
- How many investors do we have?
- I don't know.
But I say it anyway.
Is any of this true?
- Not yet.
- You're my God.
You'd better start calling writers.
Begin with Maude.
Mr. Randall.
I wanted to tell you that
I'm turning down Eastern Europe.
I more or less
thought you would.
Nice seeing you again, sir.
- Are you all right?
- Are you crazy?
Stay away from animals when
you know they're frightened of you!
Didn't you realize that on Monday?
Your presence disturbs them.
- I just wanted to say hello.
- You haven't fallen in years.
Here you still are.
Did you get lost?
- No.
- We were talking.
Henry and Caroline are here.
I told them you'd join us.
Did you? What a pity,
I'm having lunch with... Will.
It doesn't really matter to Laura
what your name is, Mr. Randall.
What is important is that you're
unemployed and I disapprove of you.
- We're going to miss your company.
- Yes. I know.
Shall we start cooking?
Your place?
A guest house.
I stay here when I'm in town.
I only have peanut butter and jelly.
We'll have to cancel lunch.
Peanut butter and jelly
is mother's milk to me.
Whatever you think
is going to happen, isn't.
Don't take anything for granted
because we exchanged a few words.
I don't take anything for granted,
except perhaps a little civility.
So what do you do?
Why do you care?
I don't. I was just making
polite conversation.
I'd rather not discuss what I do.
I think I understand
what you're like now.
You think men are only interested
in you because you're beautiful.
But you want them
to be interested in you.
The problem is
that you're not very interesting.
You're rude, you're hostile,
you're sullen, you're withdrawn...
I know you want someone to look
past all that to what's underneath.
But the only reason anyone would
bother is because you're beautiful.
Ironic, isn't it? In an odd way
you are your own problem.
Sorry, wrong line.
I'm not shocked by your keen insight
and suddenly challenged by you.
Shall we have the rest of our milk
in the living room?
Are all these you?
Yes, my father keeps this cottage
empty just for me, -
- so I can stay
as far away from him as possible.
The pictures were thrown in by the
decorator. He had a mawkish side.
- Is this you?
- My mother. She died when I was 12.
I'm sorry.
And this?
My brother. He died last year.
Yes... I remember.
He had some kind of an accident.
No. He killed himself.
He was diagnosed
borderline schizophrenic.
I guess he got tired of the title.
He lived with me on and off.
- Nice face.
- Yeah...
He was pretty nice
for a little brother.
This is really something.
Isn't it?
This is where I used to come
to bury my pets.
And this is where I realized
that one day I would die.
Standing right here on this spot,
I realized one day I would be over.
I want to tell you something.
A few days ago,
something happened to me.
I was driving in New England
and I hit an animal.
- A wolf.
- In New England? Are you sure?
I'm positive.
When I tried to touch it. It bit me.
- Did you get checked for rabies?
- Yes. I'm fine.
This will really sound insane.
The wolf passed something on to me.
A scrap of its spirit in my blood.
My senses are suddenly so acute.
I feel just so... great.
I'm just not the kind of person
who walks around feeling great.
I'm more alive. Stronger.
- It sounds strange, but...
- It's better than living in Bosnia.
No, I wasn't going to say that.
I was going to say that...
If you feel great, maybe you
should just accept it as a gift.
I'm afraid it will have a price.
There is that.
Would you like to stay for dinner?
If not peanut butter and jelly,
and I won't tell my father.
Yes.
- Let's get back before it's dark.
- Are you cold?
No. But we will be.
What is it?
- Here. Sit down.
- I think... I want to get inside.
It's not that far.
Here. Lean on me.
Listen, I'm an almost-professional
psychiatric nurse.
Elevated, but you'll live.
Is this another attack?
I don't know.
Don't be upset with me
if I tell you this, okay?
You are beautiful.
And the nicest girl...
Can I get you something to eat?
- I can't eat.
- Then go to sleep.
The next thing you know it'll
be morning and I'll make coffee.
- Eggs and toast.
- Bacon.
You think I can't get bacon?
I just may surprise you.
- I don't know where I'm going.
- Someplace nice.
- Any idea how this happened?
- None.
- Do you ever sleepwalk?
- Not that I know of.
It sounds like you took a walk
in your sleep and fell down.
There's some lacerations back here.
Nothing bleeds like the scalp.
I'll have you in
for an EEG and a CAT scan.
- You'll have to be in overnight.
- Impossible.
You could have a concussion.
No one feels this good
with a concussion.
So good to see you again
so soon. Sir.
It's nice to see you too, Will.
Robert Keyes, my counsel.
- Counselor, nice to meet you.
- Sit down. Will.
You're deliberately goading
some of our top writers -
- to become part of some
totally improbable scheme.
And being writers,
they're too damn stupid to know it.
They might not succeed,
but it won't hurt them to try.
And if they fail, any publisher
will be glad to get them.
It doesn't matter if we start a new
publishing house or go to another.
At least seven top writers
are going to leave MacLeish House.
My press release in the morning will
see this firm's reputation collapse.
- You're worse than Stewart.
- Yes.
But I have two big drawbacks:
Taste and individuality.
Maybe I can overlook them.
All right.
Call it off. Keep your job.
I'd never have fired you
if I'd known you were this ruthless.
I want a deal memo granting me
additional powers and monies.
By tomorrow morning.
- I won't agree to that.
- You will. I'd do the same.
- I'll tell Stewart.
- Wait until the deal is signed.
Then I'll tell Stewart.
- Did you contact Miss Alden?
- Not yet.
- Any appointments?
- Doctor Alezais at 4.
He's called three times to confirm.
He sounds like he's over 100.
If you want to cancel,
you'll have to do it yourself.
I was just boiling water for tea.
Perhaps you will join me. Come.
- I won't take much of your time.
- Take. I am not a busy man.
You were bitten by a wolf
in Vermont on March 8th.
Very auspicious.
- Very suspicious?
- Auspicious. Very auspicious.
March 8th. The moon was the closest
it's been to earth in 100 years.
Well... that is auspicious.
What I'm curious about is...
Could my symptoms be caused by
chemicals released from a wolf bite?
Something that medical science
has overlooked.
Among my people there is only
one explanation for your symptoms.
That you are becoming a wolf.
But... you don't believe that...
Why not?
Remember, man has only been
out of the jungle for 25,000 years.
Please. Sit down.
Life is mystical.
It's just that we are used to it.
Catholicism itself.
A religion so mystical -
- that even primitive tribes
can be converted to it.
The return after death.
Judgement Day, Heaven and Hell.
All so incredible and so ordinary.
But we are used to it.
- Honey, sugar, Sweet N' Low?
- Anything. Honey.
I don't have honey.
Visit a shaman.
He'll tell you the rules.
I can only tell you the theory.
- Do you know any of the rules?
- Very few.
The wolf rests by day
and prowls by night.
But he's always present.
He grows inside a man he's entered
until the first full moon.
Then he consumes him. Killing
all but his nature and his heart.
Not a great prognosis.
Of course.
Not all who are bitten change.
There must be something wild within.
An analogue of the wolf.
Among my people, I'm not known
for having an analogue of a wolf.
Your people are wrong. Sometimes
one doesn't even need to be bitten.
Only the passion of the wolf
is enough.
Dr. Alezais...
I'd like to know...
Not that I subscribe to this...
Neither do I.
Only to the possibility.
But out of curiosity...
Is there supposed to be any way
to stop this metamorphosis?
Supposedly there are herbs
and rites and amulets.
I don't know the rites.
I don't have the herbs.
But I did find something
for you when you called.
This is one
of the most powerful amulets.
It must be worn next to the skin
and never taken off.
If it works. There is said to be
great pain and weakness.
The wolf struggles to emerge,
and the charm holds him at bay.
I have no idea if any of it is true,
but it's yours.
It's a gift.
And in return
I would like a favour from you.
If it's in my power.
I was recently told that I am dying.
Speaking of mystical
and terrifying experiences.
I would like you to bite me.
- What?
- I would like you to bite me.
I can't ask you to transform me
with your passions.
But I ask you to honour me
with your bite.
I. Too. Will become a demon wolf.
You'd rather be damned than die?
Damnation is not a part
of my system of beliefs.
The demon wolf is not evil
unless the man he's bitten is evil.
And it feels good to be a wolf,
doesn't it?
Power without guilt.
Love without doubt.
Excuse me, I just can't.
I understand.
Keep the amulet.
If you decide to believe, -
- perhaps
you will give me your gift.
It has been a privilege.
I've never seen one like you.
- Hello?
- I've been trying to call...
Don't hang up.
Let me explain.
I'm not a fan of men
who mysteriously disappear.
I had an accident.
I sleepwalked last night.
I hit my head. I drove
to the doctor's at 6 o'clock.
But you didn't come and tell me?
No, it was 6 o'clock in the morning
and I had a scalp wound.
I didn't want you
to take care of me again.
Finish drying yourself.
The towel's driving me crazy.
Can you hear that?
Yes, it's one of my new gifts.
Laura, please... can I see you?
Can we have dinner tomorrow?
I'm at the Mayflower.
Laura?
I'll be there tomorrow at six.
You'd better look like you fell.
I do!
Room 825. What did you...
...make me for breakfast?
I'm not only the president
of the Hair Club for Men. -
- I'm also a member.
Hold it right there.
Put your hands on the cage.
Spread your legs.
He's clean.
Put your hands behind your back.
- Did you see that?
- He got my cuffs.
- Wait up!
- Have you got any money?
- Loan us some money.
- All of you?
Yeah...
I've got about $1,000 in my wallet.
How much would you like to borrow?
Give me the wallet.
Morning, this is Alice
with your8 o'clock wake up.
You must have been bad last night
I've been ringing you forever.
As a matter of fact. Alice.
I was a very good boy last night.
I went to bed...
...so early,
I don't even remember.
- Big boys here yet?
- Conference room. Deal in hand.
Don't even pretend
to have any doubts.
It's a pleasure
doing business with you, sir.
Will... I talked to Mr. Alden
about your consultant position.
It's less pay of course,
but so is Eastern Europe.
Thanks. But I've had a better offer.
- Really? What house?
- This one.
- I don't understand...
- I did the same thing you did.
I nagged Alden
until he gave me your job.
- When? I don't understand.
- In my spare time.
I guess I owe you
some congratulations.
I guess the best man won.
I'm glad in a way.
I couldn't have given it up.
And I didn't like the way I got it.
I hope we can work together
without rancor.
You're fired. Stewart.
Don't. Will. It'll ruin me.
I know. But it's best for the firm.
Give me a few months.
Let me say I quit.
No.
It wouldn't be best for the firm.
You vindictive son of a bitch!
The best thing for the firm is me.
I'm the best thing this firm has,
and you fucking know it!
- Are you crazy?
- No.
I'm just marking my territory,
and you got in the way.
Nice.
Real nice.
- Suede shoes.
- Asparagus.
Will...
Please, can I talk to you
for a moment?
A moment of your time for 16 years.
That's pretty cheap.
- What do you want?
- I want to come back.
I have no excuse. I deserve
anything you do to me.
I'm just begging you to be kind.
Has Stewart become unlovable
now that he's out of my job?
I never loved Stewart.
It was a mistake. Will.
I'm going to talk to him.
Stewart never for one moment
meant anything to me.
And you think that makes it better?
You betrayed me with a man -
- that meant nothing to you?
You betrayed me for nothing.
- Don't be so smug.
- Don't touch me.
Keep away.
Hi, I thought I'd just come on up.
Have you been waiting for me?
I can't see you.
Open the door.
You can't do this to me twice.
Open it!
I wonder
if you could do me a favour...
- Please go.
- Why? What happened?
What have you done?
Where did you get those?
I want you to go.
No.
- Tell me why you've done this.
- It's getting late.
I think I'm dangerous,
especially at night.
You're afraid that
when it gets dark, you'll attack me?
Yeah.
I think I'm turning into...
something else.
Into the thing that bit you?
Into the wolf?
- Tell me where the key is.
- I don't have a key.
I don't even know
where I got the handcuffs.
You don't have a key?
What was your plan? To sit chained
to the radiator until you grew paws?
God... you almost make this seem
like it isn't happening.
I don't have a plan.
I didn't think past
not hurting anyone.
- I don't think I can open these.
- You don't know about me.
When you're a druggie
and a delinquent, -
- and you want to get Daddy,
you get arrested.
You come into contact with
the criminal element of society.
You pick up shit you think
you're never going to need.
Then one day you meet a guy
who chains himself to the radiator.
Why do you want
any of this nightmare?
You mean instead of the gaiety
of my normal life?
I don't know.
Because I like you.
Because you're a good man.
And that's very exotic to me.
I never thought I'd meet a good man
who looked at me the way you do.
- You don't know I'm a good man.
- Yes. I do.
Then why is this happening?
I thought only the evil were cursed.
No. Not at all.
I could've told you that.
The worst things
happen to the best people.
I almost had it.
You might consider -
- that you're not cursed at all,
that you're sick.
There are brain tumors
that can cause all of your symptoms.
Tumors? What are you saying?
Are you serious?
- Yeah.
- God, if only that could be true.
How we lower our sights.
I say we get you examined
for physical causes, -
- before we take for granted
that you're becoming...
There we go. On your feet.
Let's get you re-handcuffed.
- Maybe it isn't necessary.
- Hands behind your back.
There.
You seem pretty helpless now.
- Yes.
- Great.
Interesting. What is it?
- It's a good luck charm.
- Really?
Does it work?
Well.
Today isn't turning out too bad.
- Laura...
- Yes?
Nothing... not a thing.
- Who is it?
- Police.
Detective Sergeant Bridger, NYPD.
- Is William Randall here?
- Why? What's wrong?
- I'd rather tell Mr. Randall.
- He's in the shower.
Is it okay if I come in and wait?
There's... some kind of a problem.
I understand. I'm Will Randall.
I'm renting the apartment.
About the noise last night...
He's not the hotel manager.
He's a police detective.
Could we talk in private?
That won't be necessary.
This is Miss Smith, my fiancée.
She can hear anything
that you have to say.
Your wife
was found dead this morning.
I'm sorry.
She was murdered last night.
Her body was found in the park.
- How was she killed?
- Her throat was torn out.
- Sit down.
- No... I want to stand up.
Would you mind telling me
when you saw your wife last?
Last night, here in the lobby.
- About six.
- Did you argue?
- Don't answer anything else, Will.
- I'm trying to get the facts.
The clerk said
Mr. Randall and his wife had argued.
So you already know they argued.
These are not straight questions.
Could I ask about Mr. Randall's
whereabouts last night?
Mr. Randall was with me last night.
I arrived at 6:30 and didn't leave.
Check that with the desk.
I will.
We've taken some blood and tissue
samples from your... the victim.
It would really help if you
would submit some samples...
- Not without a court order.
- Just a request.
Here's my number.
In case you want to reach me.
I'd like you to come down
to the station and give a statement.
- Both of you.
- All right.
Thank you for your cooperation.
He's got an alibi.
The girl says she was with him.
- Airtight?
- It depends on who the girl is.
Charlotte Randall was wife of the
senior editor of MacLeish House, -
- recently purchased
by Raymond Alden.
Police have no suspects in custody
at this time.
- My God!
- I hope they don't go after Will.
Why should they?
He's the husband
and they were separated.
It wouldn't be great for the stock.
It could be a bonanza for the stock.
The heat, the gossip.
- That's what publishing's about.
- Well, you handle it.
You're back in marketing.
Thank you, sir.
If they do go after Will, -
- and I hope that they don't,
I'd like to bid again for the job.
Randall has the right
to name his own replacement.
He's named Roy Macallister.
I see.
Would that contract hold
if Will was arrested?
Yes. Unless he's convicted. You'll
have to keep your fingers crossed.
- I didn't mean...
- Really? What did you mean?
I hope to God Will is innocent.
And if he is. Screw the job.
But if he's guilty...
screw Roy Macallister.
It's not much farther now.
- What if I killed her?
- What if you killed her?
Are you the guy I spent the night
with? You look so much like him.
I could have gone out
after you fell asleep.
Why does it always
have to be the worst news?
The worst pain?
The worst defeat?
- Because... what if it is?
- It's not!
It's not.
They've left the hotel.
The night clerk identified the girl.
She's Laura Alden.
How’s that for an alibi?
- Where are we?
- We're almost home.
Jesus! Where did the day go?
You'd better duck down.
- Hi. Miss Alden.
- Hi, George.
Stay down.
Hi. Tom.
Be careful of the woods.
There are some wild dogs.
- What do you mean?
- We found a deer they killed.
Thanks. I'll be careful.
Goodnight.
I want you to lock me up
before it gets dark.
- Then what?
- Then maybe it won't happen.
I don't know where else to put you
but the barn.
- Everything else has windows.
- The barn sounds good.
The barn sounds great.
I'm gonna beat this, Laura.
I'm gonna beat this.
Your phone is ringing.
- How do you know?
- I can hear it.
I'll be right back.
- Hello?
- Laura Alden?
- This is Detective Bridger.
- I know who you are.
- And we now know who you are.
- How long have you been ringing?
About two minutes. But I've been
trying to reach you all day.
Tomorrow you'll give me
the statement I asked for.
All right. Do you still want blood
and tissue samples from Mr. Randall?
They'd be useless.
We've messed up the samples
we took from the body.
What happened?
There was canine DNA
in all the tissue samples.
The victim could have been mauled
after she was killed.
Or maybe one of the lab assistants
had been petting her dog.
You scared me.
You were right.
The phone was ringing.
It was that detective. Bridger.
He traced me and now
he's threatening to subpoena me -
- if I don't give him
a statement tonight.
Will you be all right if I go in?
Yes.
Don't look so scared.
Maybe there's happy endings even for
people who don't believe in them.
I want you to know something.
I've never loved anybody this way.
I've never looked at a woman
and thought:
If the world ends. I'll still
understand what God meant -
- if I'm with her.
Laura Alden's coming in tonight.
It sounds like she's been crying.
I just got a call from
Randall's best friend.
- He wants to see me tonight.
- We've got a busy night.
The family of a kid who got
his fingers torn off is out there.
- What is there about a full moon?
- More light.
If a rich, white boy had his fingers
torn off, they'd do something.
- Laura Alden for Mr. Bridger.
- He's running behind.
- Miss Alden, take my seat.
- No.
- Please.
- No. I want to stand.
You don't know me. Stewart Swinton.
I'm a friend of Will Randall's.
I know who he is...
Well. I know his name.
This is a terrible thing.
I'm in shock over it.
Will was more than a friend.
He was my mentor.
- And you were his protégé?
- Yes. A better word.
It's a true pleasure.
A very interesting scent you have.
At once new. And familiar.
Very familiar.
Thank you.
- Were you bitten?
- What?
What a very odd question.
What made you ask such a question?
I don't know... When people
are bitten. It's often on the hand.
Why are you here?
They want some information
about the publishing house.
Stewart Swinton!
Come on in.
Will you have a drink with me?
I'll tell you all about Will.
Thank you, that's very sweet.
I'd love to.
Wonderful.
- Don't break our date now.
- I won't.
This is not easy. Will Randall
was a very dear friend of mine.
I'm not proud of what
I'm going to say.
Charlotte Randall and I...
This is hard.
Charlotte Randall and I were
having an affair. It just happened.
And Will found out.
- Yes.
- Will there be anyone else?
There will only be the two of us.
I'll be flying with a sick friend.
Could you please have it
as near the gate as possible?
In about an hour.
He was like a madman.
He was a madman. He bit me.
- He urinated on my shoe.
- Urinated...
He told me he would kill her.
I didn't believe him.
I blame myself.
If you're gonna hang a first-degree
murder rap on Will, forget it.
This was true temporary insanity.
If Will is arrested.
I'll testify to that in his defense.
I understand.
He's staying at the Alden place
with Miss Alden. Isn't he?
- I really must find him.
- Ask her. She's outside.
Laura Alden?
She's gone. She left right after
Mr. Swinton went in.
We don't need her.
Get a warrant for Randall.
Did he say
"on his shoe" or "in his shoe"?
No one gets through without a call!
No one!
The horses were restless tonight.
It's all right.
Steer clear of the barn tonight.
- Will you tell the others?
- Yes. Ma'am.
Can I help you?
- Mr. Swinton...
- I'm here to see Miss Alden.
I'm afraid I'll have to call.
May I ask your business?
Pleasure.
She'd be the fuck of the decade.
- Back up.
- All right.
Excuse me!
- Can I help you?
- I'm here to see Miss Alden.
You're not expected.
Really? I have a card...
...and an appointment. Here.
Hello. Miss Alden.
If you scream, I'II kill you.
I'll just break your neck, okay?
This is a surprise.
- How did you get in?
- I smooth-talked the guard.
If anyone could do it...
Don't play any more games.
You know, don't you?
- What?
- What's happening to me.
You're playing games with me.
You pretended not to know Will.
You know what happened
to Charlotte.
All right, I do know Will and
I do know what's happening to you.
Will told me. When I asked him
if there were any more like him.
- I'm not a fool. Laura.
- I know that.
If you find me so attractive,
how about me fucking you right now?
- How would that be?
- I'd have to try it first.
Hello. Will.
Locked you up, did she?
- Is my daughter all right?
- I thought she was with you.
Laura!
I heard gunshots.
I was afraid to come out.
- Are you with Randall?
- Where's Randall?
As far as I know, he's on his way
to Teterboro airport.
I told him I wasn't going with him.
He hung up on me.
We'd like to check the cottage.
- What's happening?
- They think Tom shot Swinton.
Laura. Tom is dead.
George, too, he was run down.
- With Stewart Swinton's car.
- He was after Will.
At the police station,
he kept asking where Will was.
Laura Alden chartered a plane.
Swinton was looking for Randall.
He asked us if Randall was here.
When he found out that Laura Alden
was gone, he took off.
All this might not have happened, -
- but I was against Randall,
because he was after my daughter.
You were just trying to save me
from a disastrous relationship.
It would only have lasted a week.
He was too tame for me.
That's what I thought when I saw
you together at the Mayflower.
I hope this time
you will give us a statement.
It would be my pleasure.
Could I get you
something to drink, detective?
- Another vodka-tonic?
- Another... no. Thanks.
Let me know if you change your mind.
How did she know I'd been drinking?
I can smell it.
I can smell it a mile away.
