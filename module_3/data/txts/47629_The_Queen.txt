For more than 50 years,
one woman has been at the heart
of Britain's great national crises.
And her own personal family turmoil.
She has shaped the nation
from behind closed doors.
Her story is all our stories.
On the day of her coronation,
the Queen's solemn face hid a dark secret
that was about to break out
and shock the watching world.
Her 22-year-old
sister, Margaret,
was having an affair with
a divorced royal servant.
Now, previously unseen documents
reveal a new story of
what really happened.
How close Margaret came to a marriage
that threatened the monarchy
and how the Queen, far
from being a bystander,
took a more decisive role
than anyone has realised.
This is how the Queen came of
age learning that to survive,
she must wield power, not
just in public, but in private.
Margaret! Peter, stop her for me!
Right! I've got her, Elizabeth!
Throw her in! Go on!
That's no way to treat a princess!
One...
two...
Your Majesty.
Papa!
Save me!
While King George was alive,
there were two princesses,
Elizabeth and Margaret.
But the happy days of the royal
family weren't destined to last.
This is London.
It is, with the greatest sorrow, that
we make the following announcement.
On 6th February 1952,
their lives changed forever.
Summoned from a royal tour of Kenya,
Elizabeth returned to Britain as Queen.
For a 25-year-old, it
was a daunting prospect.
Waiting for her was her sister Margaret
who had been with their
father when he died.
He was very loved.
It was tragic and she
worshipped her father
so tears flowed from everyone,
Such a great man.
The princess has been asking
after you... since yesterday.
Margaret?
Margaret?
You've got to be strong...
for Mummy.
For Papa.
I have been waiting for you.
I'm sorry.
Your Majesty.
Now, now, up you get.
You look so tired.
We listened to your tour on the wireless.
Papa was so proud.
And of you.
He was out all day shooting,
making jokes over dinner.
I thought he was getting better.
You have to rest.
And I must go and see Tommy.
Shall I send for the doctor?
Give you something to calm you.
Why are you going'?
So much to do.
I'm sorry, I'll come to you later.
Naturally, they were both very, very sad,
but I think maybe Princess Margaret,
she had another reason to be sad.
She said, well, you know,
I've lost my father, and in a way,
I've lost my sister up to a point,
because our lives have completely changed.
At the time of the King's death,
one in three people in Britain
believed the new Queen was chosen by God.
Not only head of state, and
head of the British Commonwealth,
Elizabeth became Supreme
Governor of the Church of England.
The young Queen was surrounded by
old men with old-fashioned values.
State documents, ma'am.
If you would kindly sign them.
Thank you, Tommy.
Her key adviser was her
father's private secretary,
Sir Alan Lascelles,
known to all by his nickname, Tommy.
Arrangements to move your Majesty's
family here at Buckingham Palace
will be made immediately.
So soon?
But we're very happy in Clarence House.
If you'll forgive me, ma'am,
to ensure a smooth
transition, you and your family
must move as soon as
possible to Buckingham Palace.
It would be for the
Princess and the Queen Mother
to move to Clarence House.
When you and they are ready, of course.
But my mother has no great wish
to leave, nor does my sister.
It is their home.
It is because, if
you'll forgive me, ma'am,
the King understood the
importance of being here.
To take any other course of action
would be utterly impractical
and unprecedented.
Very well.
Can we spare telling Margaret
for a little while, Tommy'?
Of course.
Princess Margaret had a
very different role to play.
Her sister, who she adored,
became sort of remote from her
in a way, because she had
so many duties to carry out.
Whereas, I think Princess Margaret
felt all the time that
she was slightly sidelined.
I mean, the Queen adored Princess Margaret
and she wanted her to be happy.
She really did.
As I was younger than her
we used to play together
and she was quite naughty,
actually, Princess Margaret
and we used to have great fun.
Princess Elizabeth was more solemn.
She was always saying, “Oh,
Margaret, you can't do that. "
They were very, very different characters.
Princess Margaret was up for a good time.
I think that she enjoyed being rebellious.
She did quite a lot of her rebelling,
just to show the world that she
was going to do what she wanted
and that she was going to behave
really badly if she felt like it.
In the months after the King's death,
the differences between the
two sisters grew ever wider.
It falls to me as sovereign,
to assume the Colonelcy-in-Chief
of all five regiments.
Consumed by taking on her father's duties,
the Queen juggled her two
roles as monarch and mother.
Margaret, left alone at the Palace,
was kept company by a
Battle of Britain war hero,
who had been employed
by the King as an equerry
to help him organise his diary.
His name was Group Captain Peter Townsend.
He was very good-looking.
He was a war hero.
We were all slightly in love with him.
And I think he was a sort
of male figure in her life.
He was the first man, probably,
she had come so close to
and she really didn't know
anybody else at that time.
Margaret had known
Townsend since she was 14.
16 years her senior, he
was a valued royal servant,
living in royal quarters with
his wife and two young boys.
Now she was 21 and he was 37.
He had been an escort to both
of the Princesses for many years,
but now there was only
one of them to look after.
Members of the household
knew their place.
Members of the royal household
did not become romantically involved
with members of the royal family.
No-one knows exactly when
the affair really took off.
But as the Queen settled
into her new role,
it was quickly escalating out of control.
Soon, it would start to
undermine the foundations
of the monarchy itself.
Each Christmas, at this time,
my beloved father broadcast
a message to his people,
in all parts of the world.
Today, I am doing this to
you, who are now my people.
Margaret, I can't see a thing. Shh!
Papa used to take us
down here during the war,
training for air raids.
You were probably flying overhead.
Protecting the realm.
I was just a little girl.
Above all,
we must keep alive that
courageous spirit of adventure
that is the finest quality of youth.
This is madness.
I am grown-up now.
At my coronation next June, I shall
dedicate myself anew to your service.
But I want to ask you all,
whatever your religion may
be, to pray for me on that day.
Don't stop.
May God bless and guide you
all through the coming year.
If the months after the King's death,
the new Queen was preparing for
the most momentous event of her life...
her coronation.
Whatever Palace gossip she'd heard
of Margaret's growing intimacy
with the royal sen/ant,
she had no idea how
fast it was progressing.
What had started as a fling
was about to enter a new phase.
Now we must catch up.
Are you all right?
We're out of sight. No. Not now.
Why not'? We must keep walking.
Oh, must we'?
Margaret...
What's the matter?
I'm filing for divorce.
Oh.
Rosemary's taken up with someone else.
It's my fault, apparently.
I've spent too much time
with you, and your family.
Poor Peter.
Peter Townsend had been involved
with the royal household
for quite long enough to know
this was not the sort of behaviour
that would normally be accepted
and if he didn't put a stop to
it, somebody should have done.
And when I mentioned that to
Princess Margaret many years later,
she looked at me in surprise and said,
“That's very self-opinionated of you. "
But, was it not the truth?
Had George VI still been alive,
none of this would have happened.
While Margaret favoured life in the city,
the Queen was drawn to the country.
The Palace was keen to present
the image of an ideal
family to the outside world.
Life for the Queen meant rigid protocols
and the expectation that she would
put duty above her own wishes.
However much Britain was
changing in the 1950s,
it was assumed that the 22-year-old
Princess Margaret accepted that too.
Excuse me.
You can't be going off
somewhere at this hour.
Just another party.
You don't have to go, surely.
It'll be fun. Of course it will.
Only one escape, you'll
have to get married.
You'll know when the
right one comes along.
Perhaps he has.
I've been seeing rather a lot of Peter.
Can you come with me'?
Peter?
Peter's a kind, wonderful man.
You know he is.
He is, but he's married.
He's getting divorced.
Margaret...
He's the innocent party.
I thought you'd be happy for me.
Margaret...
He's asked me to marry him.
I told him, “Yes. ”
Had this been a bachelor equerry,
things could have been very different.
But I believe the whole
business of the divorce
was at the heart of this huge scandal.
I think that was the real
stumbling block, you know,
at least among my parents and friends.
They couldn't contemplate her ever
marrying anybody who was divorced.
This wasn't just a family crisis,
it was a constitutional one, too.
Outside the family,
her closest adviser was her
private secretary, Tommy Lascelles.
As governor of the Church of England
I'm sure you're aware of Canon 107,
regarding the matter of divorce.
Townsend's status as a divorcee
means that constitutionally speaking
you cannot give your consent.
No.
I'm sure you will appreciate
the Church's position on this.
Of course.
Tommy, putting aside
constitutional issues,
what do you make of Townsend's
conduct in this matter?
I think he is a disgrace to his office.
I think he should leave the court
and be given an appointment abroad.
The King...
In my view, the King would
never have tolerated this.
There is the story
which has been quoted already that
my father actually said to Townsend,
you must be either bad or mad.
His main concern was that
Peter Townsend was an equerry
and was therefore one of the royal
household, a servant, if you like,
of the monarch and he
thought it was very improper
for anybody in the household
to have an affair with
one of the royal family.
The image of an ideal royal family
had been shattered before, in 1936,
and its impact on the
10-year-old princess
would stay with her forever.
Her uncle's decision
to put his love for a divorced
woman before his duty as King
turned a royal niece into
the heir to the throne
The abdication had been so shocking
and they felt it would
undermine the monarchy forever.
So that when this difficulty
with Princess Margaret...
Everybody thought, “Help,
it can't happen again.
“The Queen's only
just started her reign,
“we mustn't have anything
that will spoil it. "
But Margaret wasn't afraid
of the disapproval of
the Palace establishment
and the concerns of her sister did nothing
to tum her away from her
affair with Peter Townsend.
She wasn't this virgin princess
that the fairy stories tell
us that we must have around.
That aspect was very much in the
air that she was a scarlet woman.
That must have been extremely
difficult for the Queen
to have entertained.
I'm very fond of Peter, you know.
In many ways, he's part of the family.
Lillibet, I never meant
for it to happen like this.
No.
I do so want you to be happy, Margaret.
Peter makes me happy.
If only...
My coronation is two months away.
Will you do something for me'?
Will you promise me something'?
Of course.
Will you wait'?
Do nothing, say nothing and
keep this relationship secret.
Will you give me your promise?
For how long'?
Until after my tour of the Commonwealth.
That's a year away!
Papa took more than a year
before consenting to my marriage.
And after your tour, what then?
Then...
if you feel the same, we'll do all we can.
We won't breathe a word.
I promise.
Thank you, Lillibet.
Thank you.
On the 2nd June, 1953, the British
television age began in earnest
when more than 25 million
people tuned in to watch
the biggest ever live broadcast.
The Archbishop lifts
the crown of St Edward
and holds it for a moment
above the Queen's head.
God save the Queen!
God save the Queen! God save the Queen!
It was the moment the Queen had been
preparing for all her adult life,
the moment the British
monarchy joined the modem age.
But Margaret was in the shadows.
Of course, Princess Margaret really
didn't have a role to play at all.
She did have a procession,
a little procession.
I couldn't see her from where I was.
And I think that the actual ceremony
must have bitten deep into her heart
because then she really realised
how she was very much
the second in the line.
But at the most important
moment in the Queen's life,
a piece of fluff would
suddenly change everything.
When Margaret reach forward to
brush it off Peter Townsend's lapel,
the world's press knew instantly
what this intimate gesture really meant.
This may have been an unconscious
act but it was something
the world's press actually
saw, all these journalists,
and certainly abroad it
almost made a bigger story
than the coronation itself.
By that one act, an intimate act,
that you wouldn't
expect between a Princess
and the member of the household,
actually told all of these people,
and therefore their readers,
that there was something
else going on here.
Foreign newspapers were the
first to break the story.
Opening the floodgates, the British
press would inevitably follow.
Princess Margaret's scandalous
affair with a divorced royal sen/ant
was to be exposed to the
shock of the entire world.
With Margaret's secret out,
both the Palace and Downing
Street had to respond.
Ma'am, this article will appear
tomorrow in the Sunday People.
Quoting the foreign press.
They're demanding an official denial
from the Palace of these... rumours
but, Ma'am, we feel it's
a little late for that.
What did Mr Churchill have to say'?
For the Princess to marry Townsend, ma'am,
she would have to renounce
her rights to the throne.
This, the PM feels, would
profoundly weaken the Commonwealth,
undermine its allegiance to the Crown.
The PM further shares the view
that Townsend should be offered
alternative employment, preferably abroad.
What, banish Peter from court?
Ma'am, Townsend is due to accompany
the Princess on a foreign trip,
to Rhodesia.
It would hardly be appropriate.
No, Tommy, it would not.
We were absolutely
amazed, and very worried,
because she was showing the way
and whether she was going to do her duty,
or whether she was going to go
off and marry a divorced man,
was an enormous Step.
We didn't really believe it, you know.
Everybody seemed very
fond of Peter, you know,
it wasn't just Princess Margaret.
He was generally very popular.
But, I mean, yes, that was the
start of a very difficult time.
The Government, the Church
and the establishment press
were united in their
honor and condemnation.
The younger readers of the tabloids
saw the royals less as divine beings
than as people.
And they saw Margaret as a rebel,
fighting for her freedom to many for love.
I wanted them deeply to marry
because love was, you know,
we were reading Jane Austen and
terribly romantic-minded ourselves.
What? No.
But this isn't his fault!
Hello.
Thank you, Tommy.
Margaret...
Tommy's just told me
He says you agreed it.
Margaret, sit down. Banishing him.
Posting him.
And I'm not allowed to visit?
The press speculation
has been so intense...
You can't do this.
Please, Lillibet.
Margaret, I'm sorry.
The newspapers will not leave us
in peace so long as Peter remains,
we have no choice.
If you try and fight this
you will make matters worse.
Lillibet, when I get back from Rhodesia,
will Peter still be here?
I don't know.
Please...
To say goodbye.
Of course he will.
At the beginning of July 1953,
just two weeks after the
royal scandal went public,
Princess Margaret arrived with
her mother to tour Rhodesia
and Townsend was told of
his posting in Brussels.
When news of this leaked to the press,
the coverage intensified
making it harder for the Queen
to keep her promise to Margaret.
Ma'am, I'm afraid they just
won't leave this story alone.
We believe that Townsend should
leave as soon as possible.
And when would that be'?
The 15th of July, ma'am.
The 15th?
Two days before Margaret returns.
Ma'am, the longer he remains here
the more the Palace would
seem to be condoning the match.
You'll make the necessary arrangements?
Yes, ma'am.
The British Embassy in Brussels
recently attracted a number of cameras
which focused on the arrival
of group captain Peter Townsend.
He came to the Belgian capital
to take up his new
appointment as Air Attache.
Townsend was not to see
the Princess for a year.
Two days later Margaret
arrived back in London
She had been told of
Townsend's departure in Rhodesia
and had taken to her bed.
The press called it diplomatic flu.
Princess Margaret told me
the fact that they were denied
the opportunity to say
goodbye on her return
really, really did matter to her.
She was very, very upset by it
and actually really rather angry about it.
The Palace's response made the monarchy
look out of step with
the public and the times.
However cruel the banishing of Townsend,
the hope was that a long separation
would dampen Margaret's feelings
and that the romance would
fade away and be forgotten.
It was a plan that would
spectacularly backfire.
By banishing Townsend, the Palace assumed
that Margaret would see sense
and go back to putting the duties
of a royal before her personal feelings.
But the plan went wrong.
Margaret and Townsend wrote
to each other every day
for the entire year they were apart.
Far from dampening the
flames of their affection,
their absence fanned them.
A year after going to Brussels,
Townsend flew back for a secret meeting,
using a false name to avoid the press.
If they wanted to stop them now,
the Palace would have to
find a new form of attack.
It was time for Tommy Lascelles
to spell out to Margaret
the stakes she was playing
with, and that if she went ahead,
she would lose almost everything.
My father explained to her all
the constitutional difficulties
that would arise if she
married a divorced person.
And she was very grateful, and wrote
him a little note afterwards saying
what a help it had been.
Later on, as we know,
she put a lot of blame on him
for spoiling her relationship.
I think that must have
been an excuse for her...
...for her unhappiness.
According to Lascelles,
Margaret would have to give up
her right to the succession,
her title and her royal income.
But the British
establishment was changing.
When Churchill resigned, he was replaced
by Britain's first ever divorced
Prime Minister, Anthony Eden.
Margaret knew that when she was 25,
she would no longer need the
Queen's permission to many,
and Eden was a potential ally.
By the summer of 1955,
Margaret's determination to many
was strengthening.
A few more weeks to my
birthday, and we'll both be free.
You'll be free of the decision,
and I'll be free to make it.
There's nothing more you need to know'?
Don't worry. Tommy did
spell it out for me.
Said I'd lose everything if I marry Peter.
I'll be Mrs Townsend,
living in a rented flat,
doing my own washing,
cooking Peter's bloody supper.
But I'll not be told what to do by him.
I'm sure he was just trying to help.
Show you what you might lose.
In fact, I've written
to the Prime Minister.
Oh, yes'?
Sir Anthony seems a good sort.
For a married divorcee.
I want to keep him abreast
of what has happened,
so that if the time comes,
he will not be against us.
What will you say'?
That I'm going to wait till October,
when Peter's in London.
I've been missing him so much,
Lillibet, you can't imagine.
I just need to see him one more time.
To be totally sure.
In an extraordinary letter that has
been unearthed in researching this film,
Margaret wrote to Eden
asserting and clearly believing
that the most important decision in her
life was hers and hers alone to make.
“My dear Prime Minister,
“During the last of
August and all of September,
“I shall be here at Balmoral.
“And I have no doubt
that during this time,
“especially on my
birthday on August 21st,
“the press will encourage
every sort of speculation
“about the possibility of my
marrying Group Captain Peter Townsend.
“In October, I shall be returning
“to London, and he will then
be taking his annual leave.
“L do certainly hope to
see him while he is there,
“although I well know
this will provoke the press
“to still further enquiries and guesses.
“But it is only in seeing him in this
way that I feel I can properly decide
“whether I can marry him or not.
“At the end of October
or early November,
“I very much hope to be in a position
to tell you what I intend to do.
“Yours very sincerely, Margaret. "
It's a remarkable document.
This isn't just Princess Margaret
being told “You've got
to make the decision. "
This is somebody who's actually saying,
“I'm going to decide
what's going to happen here.
“And I will tell you
what I've decided. "
On Sunday 21st August, Margaret turned 25.
She was free by law to decide, and
the nation waited for an answer.
As the pressure mounted for a decision,
the Queen invited Eden to Balmoral.
In an intriguing detail from Eden's diary,
it's clear that out of many topics on
the agenda, Margaret was top of the list.
The Queen must still have believed
that Margaret had to choose between
Townsend and all the royal privileges,
but the Prime Minister
had a bombshell for her.
Sir Anthony,
I'd be grateful if you
would speak to my sister.
Would you kindly inform her of all
the obstacles that lie in her path?
Certainly, ma'am.
Although perhaps there aren't
as many as you may think.
Oh?
The lawyers have been at work.
If the Princess wishes to marry,
she may simply have to renounce her
claim of succession to the throne.
And all her royal privileges.
No, ma'am.
Nothing more.
This changed everything.
Spurred by growing public
support of Margaret's marriage,
Eden had helped find a loophole.
If Margaret married, all
she would have to give up
would be the slim prospect
of becoming Queen herself.
But all the other
barriers were taken away.
Nothing need stop her now.
.. Group Captain Peter
Wooldridge Townsend, CBO, DSO,
DFC and Bar, mentioned in dispatches
former equerry to Her Majesty.
But he is also the man the
world has been talking about
more and more over the past two years.
Seldom can a man have
been so widely discussed...
Come in.
Yes? Ma'am?
The Princess has asked if she may see you.
You know, I was just
about to go for a walk.
Would you tell her that I'm
out, but I'll be back very soon?
Very good, ma'am.
Townsend was about to
arrive back in the country
and Margaret was free now to meet
him and announce her engagement.
She no longer needed the
Queen's formal approval,
but she still wanted something that was equally important
- her sister's blessing.
But the Queen avoided her.
Is the Queen still out walking'?
Yes, ma'am.
Without speaking to her
sister, Margaret left for London
and the long-awaited reunion with Peter.
But the Queen couldn't
stall for much longer.
On October 12th, Townsend
flew back into Britain.
This time, he was
confident enough to brave
the glare of the world's media.
Later that day, Margaret
arrived in London too
the first time they had both been officially
together in the city for two years.
The world's media went into a frenzy.
Princess Margaret and
Group Captain Peter Townsend
are two important weekend guests
at Allanbay Park, near Windsor.
Pressmen and sightseers throng the lanes,
undeterred by the official statement
that no announcement is
contemplated at present
about the Princess's future.
Only a brief glimpse is caught of the
royal visitor as her car hurries by.
Blasted flashbulb nearly blinded me.
“No, I have nothing
to say. Nothing to say. "
I swear I'm saying it in my sleep.
They're supposed to be on our side.
Can you believe this?
The Queen's press secretary announces
that no announcement is
at present contemplated.
A “no announcement”
announcement. Only from the Palace...
Peter, shut up!
Sorry.
No. No, I'm sorry.
The Palace called.
You've spoken to the Queen?
They want me to go to
Windsor at the weekend.
On my own.
Although daunted by the
prospect of meeting her sister,
Margaret knew she was in reach
of achieving her impossible dream.
As she returned to Clarence House,
it's now clear that the Government
were fully prepared for a marriage.
Independently, they drew up a statement
for the Princess to tell the world.
“After careful thought, I
have come to the conclusion
“that it is necessary
to my future happiness
“that I should marry Peter Townsend.
“At the same time, I
recognise that I should give up
“my rights to the succession, both
for myself and for my descendants. "
Peter Townsend was powerless,
pursued by the world's press,
as the two sisters prepared for the
most important meeting of their lives.
The waiting couldn't last any longer.
On Friday 21st October,
the Queen and the Princess
attended the unveiling of
a statue of King George VI.
He never wavered in his
faith that, with God's help,
the cause of freedom would prevail.
The Queen knew that nothing
stood between Margaret
and her future happiness,
nothing except herself.
On the Saturday evening,
Margaret travelled up to Windsor
to join the Queen, Prince
Philip and the Queen Mother.
By the end of the weekend,
the decision would be made.
It's almost certain that this was
make-your-mind-up time,
this was crunch time.
She must have been deeply
upset for her sister.
In fact I knew she was deeply upset,
that her sister had to go through.
But I'm sure also that in her
own mind, the Queen's mind,
she knew the right course.
On Sunday 23rd October, after church,
the Queen finally faced the meeting
with her sister that she had dreaded.
Shall we take some air, Margaret?
Of course.
If that's what you would like.
The world's gone mad.
I've been so frightened.
You're safe here,
no photographers.
Poor thing, you've been besieged.
I've wanted to see you.
To talk to you for so long.
You've got so many friends.
Newspaper editors,
even the Prime Minister.
I feel so alone.
What about Peter?
Peter's been... very supportive.
It is what you want, isn't it, Margaret?
You can have it now.
Isn't it enough to want to be happy'?
Do you really think we are so free
to put our own happiness first?
People look to us,
Margaret, to our family,
to reflect what is noble in themselves.
And what matters most?
Is it how we dress, where we live'?
Or is it how we behave?
Lillibet...
You may keep the appearance
of royalty, Margaret,
but if you do this, will the substance
of who we are, who you
really are, ever be the same'?
I never wanted to go against
your wishes, Lillibet.
I never wanted to defy you.
You never have.
But this is not my decision now.
It is yours.
Leaving Windsor, the course of
Margaret's future life was determined.
Her decision had been made
and she was ready to announce
it to the waiting world.
Princess Margaret's personal message
issued from Clarence House
began with these words, “I
would like it to be known
“that I have decided not to
marry Group Captain Peter Townsend.
“Mindful of the Church's teaching
“that Christian
marriage is indissoluble,
“and conscious of my
duty to the Commonwealth,
“I have resolved to put these
considerations before any others.
“L have reached this
decision entirely alone
“and in doing so, I
have been strengthened
“by the unfailing support and
devotion of Group Captain Townsend. "
I can remember thinking that
when the relationship was severed,
being extremely unhappy and
feeling for her very deeply.
We were all very heartbroken
at her having to forfeit
what looked like the
most romantic marriage,
this dashing Group Captain and this
phenomenally attractive Princess.
It was the wrong ending to a novel.
We still felt that it wouldn't
be possible, not in that time,
for her, in her position,
to marry Peter Townsend.
Therefore, when she did as she did,
made the decision not to carry on,
I think we were deeply
sympathetic and sad for her.
The Queen may very well have said
to her sister at the beginning,
“I can't advise you,
this is your decision,
“I'm going to stand back. ”
But with the documents we now
have before us, I rather feel
that the Queen's role was actually
more pronounced in all of this
than we might otherwise have thought.
Inevitably so, given the
position that she held.
Three years after
becoming Queen, the crisis
that had ripped at the heart of her
personal and public life was over.
She had placed duty above
the passions of her family
and had begun to exercise
power in subtle ways,
often withholding her blessing
rather than issuing commands.
She was developing a
personal style of authority
which she would use to influence
events in the coming years.
Margaret, launching herself
into London's social life,
would never challenge
her older sister again.
Margaret, what a surprise.
I wanted to say goodbye
before you go to Africa.
We hardly see you now.
I suppose I'm kept busy.
I read about you, parties, openings.
Are you enjoying society life?
I try not to be alone too much.
Papa would be so proud of you.
Would he?
Of course.
I think about Papa a great deal
and I wonder if you would...
Margaret, I have to go.
I'll write to you very soon.
Goodbye.
