<i>Bella Brown.</i>
<i>Well, what can I say?</i>
<i>There was nothing
normal about the girl.</i>
<i>It's a miracle she survived at all
after her arrival in this world.</i>
<i>They say she would have perished
if it hadn't been for the ducks.</i>
<i>Sat on her like an egg,
they did.</i>
<i>Treated her as one of their own.</i>
<i>She was finally discovered by
one of those ancient lunatics</i>
<i>who frequent
the parks of our city</i>
<i>and seem to
enjoy hypothermia.</i>
<i>She grew into the
oddest of oddballs.</i>
<i>Terrified by the unpredictability
of nature and flora in particular.</i>
<i>Where on Earth that came from,
I dread to think.</i>
<i>She's always had
a preoccupation with order.</i>
<i>Would have tried the
patience of a saint,</i>
<i>never mind the nuns
at Saint Fedelma's.</i>
Bella Brown.
<i>It's an insular and solitary world
for Miss Brown.</i>
<i>Just her and her books.</i>
<i>Hers was a story just
waiting to be told.</i>
<i>But the obsessive little
world she created</i>
<i>meant that this was one book
that remained firmly shut.</i>
<i>I'm not a religious man,</i>
<i>but I believe someone sent her here</i>
<i>to test us.</i>
Today, I'm going to
make a difference.
<i>Why am I wasting your time with
all this worthless tittle-tattle?</i>
<i>Because through some misguided care
in the community scheme,</i>
<i>this strange creature
has become my next-door neighbor.</i>
<i>May I remind you,</i>
on your allocated days
you are to arrive
here by 9:00 and
work until 4:30 with
an hour for lunch
and two 15-minute breaks for tea.
This morning you are to attend to
"Oceanography, A through to J,"
which is quite frankly,
all at "C".
Hmm.
Ah, hello. Erm...
Sorry. Er, I'm looking for Leonardo
di ser Piero, er, da Vinci, please,
erm, technical drawings and the
like, if you'd be so kind.
"Leonardo da Vinci,
civil engineering,"
in brackets, "European history. "
Our back wall, bottom left.
- Ah, marvelous.
- Oh, and are you a member?
Oh, no, not going to
take them anywhere.
I'd only lose them,
and where would that get us?
Yes, may I remind you, no eating
or drinking in the library
and we expect absolute silence
at all times.
- Of course you can.
- Absolute.
Absolutely.
Oh. Hello, sorry.
Oh, thank you once again.
Yes, sorry. No, my mistake.
Sorry, yes.
Mmm.
Oh. Yes, yes, sorry. Absolutely.
<i>The library will be closing
in three minutes exactly.</i>
<i>Please return your books
from whence they came,</i>
<i>and make your way
to the exit immediately.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>
Huh.
No!
Look what I've found.
Ah, yes. Our very own
horticultural terrorist.
That place has gone to rack and
ruin since she's moved in.
Will you please calm down
and leave the poor girl alone?
"Leave her alone"?
Have you seen what's she's done?
It's nothing less
than wanton criminal neglect.
I'm Milly Wilton, Mr. Stevenson's
long-suffering doctor.
You took a tumble.
Your garden fought back,
that's what.
- You'll survive, no harm done.
- "No harm done"?
I think harm's had
an absolute bloody field-day.
Blood pressure.
- Ah.
- Don't worry.
Tea is on its way.
Vernon! Where's that damn tea?
So, young lady, what is it you do
when you're not murdering plants?
I work in the library,
filing mostly.
- But really, I'm a writer.
- Ah, a writer, I see.
Yes, well, that keeps you
out of the garden, doesn't it?
Sorry for the inconvenience.
"Inconvenience"?
What about sorry for
the unmitigated
eco-apocalypse
you've created?
Vernon! The tea!
- Textbook.
- Great.
I hope you enjoy making me ill.
There's only person
responsible for your health.
Yes, you.
Vernon, tea please!
Yeah, okay, all right, all right.
Keep your hair on. Sorry.
Hi, Milly. All
right, stop shouting.
Hi.
There you go, okay.
Cup of tea.
Here, then.
Go on. They're homemade.
All right.
- I've got to go.
- Delicious.
Oh, thank you. Eighty-five
percent cocoa, that's the trick.
And I make them with
oat bran so they're
not so bad here
for his lordship.
You look repellent
in that apron and
you've been wearing
it too long.
See the abuse that I
have to put up with?
If he wasn't so sick, I wouldn't
let him get away with it.
Don't speak to me like that. If you
continue speaking to me like that,
I'm going to quit,
do you understand?
Quite the Celtic Braveheart, aren't
we, when we've got an audience?
He doesn't realize
how important this job is to him.
Anyway, you can
start cleaning the
carpet, thanks to
our unwanted guest.
Yes, any time in the
next 30 seconds.
No, no, no, I've got to go,
I've got to let the babysitter go.
Well, you better start
straightaway, hadn't you?
Bella Brown.
For God's sake, stop
that Gaelic gibberish.
- I'll do it.
- Oh.
No, it's okay.
It's part of my job.
Go on, you'll be late.
Don't be ungracious,
Vernon, thank the girl.
Oh, sorry, thank you.
Erm, it's just
my kids will be
really worried.
Okay.
Slavery was abolished in 1834,
just so you know.
And this country's been
going down the drain ever since.
Hi, Bella, this is Sinead.
This is Niamah. Say hi, girls.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- So we've come to cook
you breakfast. - What?
Well, it's the least we could do
after last night.
Come on, girls. Come on. In we go.
- Huh.
- There we go.
Okay, girls, will you help me
take out the ingredients?
Oh, it's dark in here,
do you mind if I open these?
Uh...
Well, that's very
thoughtful of you,
Vernon, but there's
really no need.
- Why, have you eaten?
- No.
Well, it's really not a problem,
I'm gonna get the girls picked
up here after breakfast anyway.
So, er, okay,
let's see what we're working with.
Food prison.
I really need to get
ready for work.
Oh, don't let us stop you.
We've got it covered. Off you go.
Okay.
Okay, girls. You pick that up.
Good girl.
You take that one.
Okay, need you
to whack it in there, that's it.
Okay. Well done.
Oh, there's Bella. Hello.
Right.
So, what have we got here?
Mmm-hmm.
Enjoy.
You don't have to eat it all.
Erm, I do make big portions
for the big man next door.
Okay, there's your lift, girls. Oh,
my gosh, look at the time. Okay.
Okay, go on now. Quickly,
quickly, quickly.
Okay, don't fall, slow down please.
Thanks, Jean.
Bye!
All right.
Does their mum take them to school?
No, erm, my wife, er,
passed away, so...
The breakfast is
delicious, thank you.
Oh.
It's a long time
since I heard that.
You're welcome.
Your employer's a bully. I don't
know why you put up with it.
Well, you know, you get used to it
and it pays the rent.
Is that him in the garden?
- No, I can't do it.
- What do you mean you can't do it?
- Ah-ha.
- Do you mind?
You may have won the hearts
of my slow-witted staff,
but not me.
I can't forgive this.
You have squandered
everything nature has given you.
Why are you doing this to me?
It's something
everyone must learn, Miss Brown,
it's called responsibility.
Anathema to you, perhaps,
but it's an important part
of the human condition.
And you, spuds for
brains, are late.
No, I'm not.
You are now. I cannot
tolerate tardiness,
so I won't be paying
you for today.
- I've had enough of this.
- What?
I'm warning you,
Alfie, one more word
and you can shove
your job, yeah?
You're fired.
Okay, will that be
my first verbal warning, then?
You're sacked, Vernon,
end of story.
You've heard of the three-stage
dismissal process, have you?
What?
Let me see, I've been working
with you for five years,
that's a minimum of
five months' paid notice.
I can get you a copy of
the Employment Act, if you want.
You'd be better off rehearsing,
"Would sir like chips with that?"
Save you time.
He could work for me.
- What?
- What?
You could work for
me if you wanted to.
I do, I do want to.
Yeah, I do.
Uh, so, looks like I'm
working here now.
So, you're trespassing.
Well, make the most of it.
You deserve each other.
We'll keep my usual payday,
first of the month, thank you.
Good.
I may have been a little hasty.
No, no, no, it's good, it's good.
It would be a fresh start.
I don't know how I'll pay you.
It's okay.
He'll pay me, so you don't have to.
I'll show that mean old man
what he's missing.
Have you already got a cleaner?
Just me.
Right.
There's "cleaning",
and there's cleaning...
No, um... Uh,
please don't do that.
There's only some things that
a professional can spot.
Oh, God.
I can't be late for work again.
Please don't touch anything.
Right, let's go.
Sorry, hello. Hello again.
Right, erm, Gian Lorenzo Bernini.
- Sculptural architecture.
- Oh.
Sculpture, of course, every time.
It's the fourth aisle on
your right, top left shelf.
Top left, thank you.
<i>Do you know The Ecstasy
of Saint Theresa?</i>
Uh, yes, I've seen the pictures.
Oh, no, no, no, you must
see it in the flesh.
It's incredible.
He makes tons of
marble simply float.
Defies gravity with beauty.
Destroys logic with emotion.
Psst.
Horticulture.
Sorry.
How is it?
It's wonderful.
Well, the vegetables haven't
been tinned for two decades,
so you might actually be able
to taste them.
Where did you learn
to cook like this?
My mum, God rest her.
Was she a cook?
No, she couldn't cook for toffee.
So, I had to
take matters into my own hands
as soon as I could reach the stove.
Bella, look, there's something
I have to tell you.
I did your laundry
today and I threw
in some of the girls'
stuff and, er...
Oh.
Yeah, I think it was this
little fella to blame.
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.
I'll put them over here.
You all right? Sorry.
<i>Give me back my cook.</i>
- Who is this?
- Your nemesis.
Alfred Stevenson,
your next-door neighbor.
Oh. Hello.
I'm sorry for the inconvenience...
Give me back my cook!
Hello?
Miss Brown?
I haven't got all day, Miss Brown.
I wasn't expecting you until the
start of the month, Mr. O'Brien.
I'm here on urgent
business, Miss
Brown, a matter of
grave importance.
Now, then, let me see,
Flat 2, 6 Primrose Gardens.
I have the appropriate paperwork
pertaining to the property,
and the relevant
photographic documentation to...
Ah!
This is all shipshape, Miss Brown,
very soothing on the eye.
Of course.
But I've received a complaint.
What, from who?
Oh, my word.
This is worse than I expected.
You agreed to keep the property
in sound repair, Miss Brown.
The property, Miss Brown,
includes the garden.
I know.
Uh, I'm not much for the great
outdoors. I'm more of a sort of...
I'm a fair man, but
I am bound by the
law, as detailed
in the contract
signed by your good self.
I have a dislike... More
of a distaste of...
You see, plants and
I don't really get
along, so it's not
really neglect,
it's more of a fear and
loathing, but I...
I promise you I can fix that.
Everything will go back to normal.
Laws are there to
provide boundaries, Miss Brown.
This wanton level of neglect falls
well within your legal obligations
and you are, therefore, in breach.
Good morning.
I'm Vernon, I'm Miss Brown's...
Er, partner.
Gideon O'Brien, landlord.
We were just discussing the
spectacular level of neglect
relating to the 29-foot
north-facing garden
with lawns and
well-stocked borders.
Right, yeah, we're just about to
get into the garden.
Yeah, that's a major priority,
that's top of the list.
I'm afraid it's too late for that.
I shall have to ask you to vacate
by the end of the month.
Were you expecting
Mr. O'Brien this morning?
I wasn't.
Right, and you made an appointment?
I beg your pardon.
Section 34 of the Property Act.
A landlord must
give clear warning
if he wants to inspect
the property.
Very well, we'll come
back later then.
I can't do later,
that's not convenient.
A convenient date must be mutually
agreed, that's Section 17c.
- Tomorrow then?
- Tomorrow's no good.
- Friday?
- Friday...
No, can't do Friday.
- Next Monday.
- Next Monday's no good.
All right then, when?
One calendar month's notice.
Section 17c.
You know that.
There will be
repercussions, Miss Brown.
If this garden is not fixed,
you're out on the street.
You have exactly one
month from today.
What's the matter?
I'm kidding myself, I'm no writer
and I'm certainly no gardener.
What are you talking about,
of course you're a writer.
No, I'm not.
And I'm going to be evicted
and then I'll be homeless
and you'll be unemployed
and it's all my fault.
Oh, I see.
You're feeling
sorry for yourself.
No.
I mean, you have to look at the
facts, you have to weigh it up.
- What?
- Stand up.
Go on.
Okay, stay still, I
don't want to hurt you.
When was the last
time you were hugged?
- It's been a while.
- Yeah.
Right, get on with it.
<i>Lonicera Aureoreticulata.</i>
"Honeysuckle" to you.
Although personally I
think they look better
when they are attached
to the plant itself.
And, look, right
next it, Delphinium.
Great big iridescent
blue flowers before
you cut them up
into little pieces.
I think they were
the last living
things in your
horticultural graveyard.
I was just trying to tidy up a bit.
I think that's what Hitler said
about Europe.
Anyway, enough of this small talk,
give me back my cook.
What? No.
Give him back! I need him.
Well, you should
have thought about
that before you treated
him like dirt.
Stop it...
Don't act like a little girl,
give me my cook back.
- Give him back!
- Can't hear you.
What the hell is wrong with you?
You could come and help, you know.
Oh, I'm sorry, I
would, but hay fever.
Chronic allergies,
my head swells up like a pumpkin.
I'm no use to man or
beast, I'm sorry.
There you go.
It may look like a
simple quiche and
salad, but the
balsamic reduction
and the onion glaze
elevates it to
something altogether
more satisfying.
Enjoy.
<i>I didn't want to have
to spell it out to you,</i>
<i>but I'm a dying man.</i>
<i>Unlike you, I don't have long left.
Time is my enemy.</i>
<i>I mourn every minute.</i>
<i>Every precious second
marks my life draining away.</i>
That's dreadful, I had no idea...
<i>I don't have much
to give me comfort,</i>
<i>no friends, no family,
no one to love.</i>
<i>I only have the beauty of nature</i>
<i>and the promise of a
hearty last meal.</i>
<i>I beg you,
send Vernon home to me</i>
<i>and we can put all this
silly mess behind us.</i>
I had no idea you were so ill.
- I'm so sorry, I can talk...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- What are you doing?
- Don't listen to that.
He's dying, why didn't you tell me?
That old coot's been dying
for the last 10 years.
Vernon!
Okay, let me guess, was it, erm...
"Time is my enemy.
"I mourn every minute,
I mourn every second. "
Or was it,
"I have no friends, I have no
family, I have nothing, nothing. "
He used both.
Oh, hey. So, he's
getting desperate.
Perfect.
It's shut, it's bloody shut.
Sorry, Miss Bramble, problem
with the buses this morning.
Mmm, I think our problem is with
you, not with public transport.
And I wouldn't be making this point
if your tardiness was
not pathological.
So sorry, hate to interrupt,
looking for Herculaneum Parma.
"Lamperna... " Er...
"Architecture", back wall on
your right, third shelf down.
Thank you.
We also have a book
on his early illustrations.
That's exactly what I'm looking
for, thank you so much.
You're welcome.
Hmm.
Oh. Goodbye, Miss.
Thank you again for earlier.
Oh, it's nothing, really.
What's your name, by the way?
Don't know what to call you.
Shh!
It's Bella.
Bella Brown.
Well, I'm William. William Tranter,
but everyone calls me Billy.
See you soon, Bella.
Billy.
Billy Tranter.
Excuse me, young lady.
Would you be so kind
as to point me to the section
that deals with home cookery?
Certainly, sir,
it's the third aisle on your left,
lower two shelves on your right.
Thank you, very helpful.
We have recently received
Walker Owens' latest.
<i>Dinner for One,</i>
<i>Simple Joy and the
Classic Simple Recipes</i>
<i>for Solo Dining, which
is always popular.</i>
Thank you, very helpful.
We do try to be of assistance.
Well, the best assistance would be
to give me back
my bloody Irishman,
you heartless...
Shh!
This library is a
refuge for learning
and requires silence
at all times.
Oh, "Learning"?
Well, then how is it your employees
have learned nothing of compassion
for their starving fellow man,
for the hungry, aged and decrepit,
the forgotten generation
that made this country great...
Get out.
Get out immediately
or I'm calling the police.
Excellent, have her arrested.
She murders flora
that keep this planet alive.
Be silent and leave!
I'd stick to writing if I were you.
Oh, just tell me what I should be
doing, you horrid wretched old man.
Why should I furnish
you with that advice?
I've got three weeks
to turn this garden around
or I'll wind up
sleeping in the park.
Is everything okay?
I am trying my best here,
I want to make a difference, and
if you had an ounce of humanity,
you wouldn't just stand there
gloating at me, you would help me.
All right, I'll help.
- You will?
- Yes.
Now you give me back my cook.
- No.
- Yes.
He's not a slave, he's
not mine to give.
If you had treated
him like a person...
Okay, okay, okay, I'll cook your meals,
you vituperative old bastard.
Excellent.
And five syllables, Vernon,
I didn't know you had it in you.
But I won't set foot
inside that house.
Well, I'm not going to
eat scraps out of a
plastic container like
some trainspotter
on a windy platform in Runcorn.
I'll cook your meals,
you help her fix
up the garden, that
way we all win.
Take it or leave it, Alfie.
I'll take it.
Okay, house rules,
breakfast at 8:00,
lunch at 1:00,
dinner at 6:00.
Meals will be left here
at exactly those times
and then I'm going to
ring this bell twice,
so you know you can retrieve them.
I'll leave serving
instructions if necessary so I
don't have to hear your
voice or see your face.
Yes, but what if...
<i>Creating a garden
starts as an interest</i>
<i>and soon becomes a
lifetime's obsession.</i>
<i>One that can be engaged
at a moment's notice.</i>
"By simply stepping outside. "
"A true gardener
can create more
happiness propagating
life in one seed
"and seeing that
single flower unfold
"than the rich man could ever get
from his perfect rolling lawns. "
I've never known him to let that
book out of his sight before.
Thank you so much for the book.
- I love the illustrations.
- You read it?
Every word.
<i>So, what are you
talking to me for?</i>
<i>Get to work or O'Brien
will have you out.</i>
What now?
Now, you dig.
Vernon, can you hear me?
What?
No black pudding with my breakfast
this morning, my Irish friend.
Yeah, fine.
- Did you read the book?
- I did.
What's this?
Soil.
If you leave the roots of the weeds
in the soil,
they'll grow back
before you even finish digging.
They'll strangle the life
out of your new creation.
It's just like a time
bomb waiting to go off.
Dig it all again,
sieve out the roots.
I need my bed.
It's about bloody time.
A man could die of
starvation in this place.
- Billy.
- Bella.
Silence.
Sorry.
You know, I believed
those things you said.
Why would you say that?
Vernon told me how many times
he's heard the exact same stories.
Shame on you.
You should doubt only a man
who changes his story.
I only repeat myself
in the vague hope that one day
somebody will actually hear me.
Breathtaking, isn't it?
Come, come, come.
<i>Like sparks falling
from a giant furnace.</i>
In some countries they hold
parties when it starts to rain.
But here, we just scurry around
and run for cover.
It's the most important currency
in the world,
and yet, in our
green and pleasant
land where we take
so much for granted
we see it only as a means
of ruining expensive hairdos
and making taxi drivers rich.
You're odd.
Says she.
Here.
Ailanthus, giant sunflower.
Start off with them,
incredibly beautiful.
They need a lot of light and heat.
They follow the arc of the sun
from dawn until dusk, extracting
maximum energy from every day.
It's a very, very clever flower.
Think about that.
I think there might be
a garden here, after all.
Arthur's book, it's gripping,
where did you get it?
He was a friend of mine.
Dear old Arthur showed me the
path to true enlightenment
and then took me on an
incredible journey.
Well, look after it, it's
the only one I've got.
I'm amazed you trusted me with it.
So am I.
I bet even Arthur would have
been daunted by this garden.
No, he would have relished it.
Totally blank canvas, chance to
create your own masterpiece.
Come. Come on, follow me.
How do we make a garden?
How do we build a color palette?
How do we create depth and texture?
How do we keep interest
from April to October?
Well, we start
with these stunning foxgloves,
and these alliums.
Come on. Come, come, come.
<i>And then we go on to these mamas</i>
and these dahlias so colorful
they hurt your eyes.
And these gloriously purple salvias
that go on flowering
until the frost claims them.
Then the Verbascum,
and we've got the evening primrose
and those deliciously green
shuttlecock ferns.
And, look, clambering
climbing clematis,
the sweet rocket, and, look,
these monkswood so beautiful
and poisonous they'll kill a man.
That's an interesting
contradiction, isn't it?
That lily, golden splendor,
persicaria, nicotiana,
and hollyhocks. Come.
Begonias.
Magnificent agapanthus.
And, well, the list is endless.
It's a world of beautifully
ordered chaos.
That's chaos, not calamity,
Miss Brown,
because if you don't
understand the difference,
then we won't progress very far.
We?
What?
<i>You said, "We. "</i>
No, that's ridiculous.
Two weeks to turn this
into a garden.
Bella?
Everything all right?
Yes, of course,
I'm just letting off some steam.
Ah. I see.
So, what brings you here?
I come here every Sunday.
I see. To scream and shout
and exhale the week?
Yes.
- And feed Sid.
- Which one's Sid?
The scruffy one.
Well, I bet he was a
looker in his day.
Mmm. He was.
Are you here to work?
Oh. No, goodness, no,
I've just come to sketch,
doodle, think, work things out.
Erm, I invent things,
I'm a designer.
Numbers and working parts,
that's my specialty.
These ideas, they sort of come out
faster than I can cope sometimes.
Pure left-brainer.
I'm more of a no-brainer.
I don't believe that for a second.
You seem to know so much, every
book, every author, every shelf.
I'm only working there
until my book gets published.
Oh, how exciting. What's it about?
It's a children's book,
but it doesn't really...
Well, what I mean is...
Doesn't really have a
story at the moment.
Oh, how novel.
Um, sorry, er, tea?
Thank you.
Ah.
I like your mechanical bird thing.
How on Earth do you
know about that?
The other day, in the library,
you left a piece of paper.
Oh.
Right, yes, I see,
erm, my mechanical bird thing, yes.
- Well, I really ought to...
- Would you like to see it?
My bird thing.
Well, I only, er, live
a few minutes away.
- It's not far.
- I really should...
No one else has seen it yet.
No one else has been invited.
- No, I really should...
- It would be rude to say no.
- I suppose I...
- Excellent.
Come on, I'm, erm, just round here.
- Here we are.
- Wow!
When my parents died,
they left George the town house,
Edward got the cottage
and I got this.
It's incredible.
Part of the joys of being the
eldest, I got first pick.
Here we go.
Ah!
Right. Now...
Uh...
This is Sergis, he's
particularly interesting.
I've made the body of a tortoise
with the engine of a hare.
He still needs a bit
of work though.
Um... And then over here...
Um...
Ah-ha!
Now for the main event.
This.
This is Luna.
She's powered by light.
- Solar powered?
- Even moonlight.
Hence, Luna.
Hence, Luna.
I love her.
I'm so glad.
Well, you're the writer, Bella,
tell me a story about Luna.
Luna couldn't always fly, you know.
No? Why not?
Well, long ago, before
the world was round,
Luna and the rest of her species
inhabited a remote forest.
They had tiny little wings,
but were flightless.
They foraged around
on the forest floor
and kept themselves
very much to themselves.
Luna lost her parents
at a very early age.
They were taken from Luna
just like that,
no explanation.
Barely out of the nest,
she was too young to know anything.
She was such a warrior.
Only coming out for food briefly
when all the other animals
had gone to sleep, and the...
The forest floor was
bathed in moonlight.
She was such a scrawny
little thing.
A loner.
Well, life was passing by until one
day Luna saw a kindly traveler
holding a thing of great wonder
and beauty and...
And...
And what?
And that's it. For now.
But I'd like to know
what happens next.
So do I.
Are you kicking me, Mr. Stevenson?
No.
I'm encouraging you to get up.
If you ignore my encouragement,
then I'll start kicking you.
This garden is taking forever.
Well, everything that
matters takes time.
You can speed-read,
but you can't speed-garden.
Try telling that to O'Brien.
Look at that. Look.
What's that?
<i>It's called Fragaria Virginians.
It's a wild strawberry.</i>
Life and nature, it's just waiting
to burst out anywhere it can,
seeking the light,
getting on with it.
It's very simple.
Must have been buried under
a ton of rubbish.
Hmm. Isn't it always like that?
- Now you can see...
- Wait, wait. What?
You can even see the
pictures of it,
sometimes, while you can manage...
- Now you see?
- Really far away and then...
Really far away...
Ah, yes, I should have warned you.
Laundry was never
Vernon's strong point.
I've got something for you.
Queen Victoria wore
more color than you.
I always feel I'm at a
funeral when you're around.
Charming.
So, have you given this
much thought?
Well, it should get around
five hours of sunlight a day,
I've given it the minimum depth of
two feet for the lilies,
and other aquatic
plants, with a
one-foot overhang
all the way around.
And Vernon's going to help
with the filter and the pump.
What's he going to do,
cover them in puff pastry?
How quickly do you think
we could put the fish in?
Well, personally, I'd wait
until there was water in there.
But approximately how soon?
- Miss Brown.
- Yes?
Just dig.
Well... You're much better.
Yes, well, that's because I take
all that unnecessary medication
that you force-feed me.
A - ha!
- What on Earth is that?
- Room service.
Breakfast is in the
shed, come on, hurry.
Oh, hello, Milly.
This is the most bizarre thing
I've ever seen.
Well, it's the only way
he's going to eat my food.
His lordship would like to know
if there's any black pudding.
No.
Tell him they ran out, and it's
bad for his cholesterol anyway.
You of all people should know that.
But don't you dare tell him
I said that.
Hmm.
Are you going to explain
what's going on?
No.
- Mr. Stevenson.
- Yes?
Can I ask you a
personal question?
No.
- Please.
- No.
Ask me one then.
Definitely not.
Why not?
I don't want to prod around
in your obsessive little world
any more than I have to.
I'm speechless.
If only that were true.
Now, shut up and dig.
I can't.
Why not?
It's done.
Well?
"Well" what?
Aren't you going to thank me
for all my hard work?
Uh, you'll come for tea at 4:00.
This is beautiful.
Fantastic.
When I was younger,
I did a lot of traveling.
I collected seeds
from the most spectacular plants.
Each one is from a
different country.
Different color, different smell,
and most importantly,
different memory.
I spend my days breathing life
into these wonderful things.
- Where are these from?
- Iran.
Uh, I found them on a mountainside
overlooking the sea.
Will you tell me about it?
Uh, here. Here.
Take these.
They're rather old, but fine
quality. Do them justice.
But I... I don't
really know how to...
No, don't think, just do.
So, where was I?
Iran.
Oh, yes. In the province
of Mazandaran on
the southern shore
of the Caspian Sea.
Which is in fact the
world's biggest lake.
Uh, which is in fact
your last interruption, young lady.
I was walking through a field
that seemed endless,
and all around was this
blanket of deep red peonies.
Though, anyway, let me go back.
I...
It was July when I arrived in
Tehran, and it was bloody hot.
And it was very grand
in those days, Tehran.
This is disgraceful.
I'm so sorry. Very rude of me.
Um, ham and piccalilli?
It's delicious.
- I don't want your sandwich.
- No?
Oh, then, really,
you must have a pickled egg.
You can gather your things together
and get out.
Right.
Leave the book!
Don't think I can't see what's
going on between you two.
It's disgusting.
Oh, by the way, thank you so much
for those Imparna recommendations.
Really, inspiring stuff.
Especially the bird...
Get out! Get out!
Psst. Bella. Hello.
Just wanted to say
I'm sorry if I've
caused you trouble
with the old windbag.
It's a pity you got chucked out
when you did.
I'd found some fantastic
Viking drawings
which I thought would
be great for Luna.
Well, you could always show me now.
No, I...
I... No, I couldn't...
I couldn't possibly...
Fraternizing with the enemy is
bad enough, but I... No, I...
Mmm-hmm. Pink wafers?
They're Miss Bramble's biscuits.
Mmm. Delicious.
So, what happens to Luna?
Mesmerized, Luna couldn't help
but think about the peony.
Luna asked the traveler where
he'd got the beautiful flower.
"There are many,"
the traveler said.
"From the top of the mountain,
you can see thousands.
"A sea of petals.
"It will make your heart sing,
for it's a beautiful sight. "
"But how will I get to the top
of the mountain?
"I can't fly, and I only
come out at night. "
But the traveler had
heard this before.
"You seek the rarest
flower from the top
of the tallest
mountain in the world.
"If you want to see
them enough, you will. "
Luna was scared and excited
in equal measure.
"I think I will find
my mother and father there. "
The traveler smiled.
"You have much to learn, child.
"Are you sure you want to continue
on this perilous quest?"
Keep going.
I don't know what happens next.
But I want to know the ending.
Will you have tea with me tomorrow?
After work.
Yes, please.
That would be lovely.
Well, until tomorrow, Bella Brown.
<i>Under the old cedar
tree in the park. 6:00.</i>
Bella.
Bella, wake up.
Billy.
It's not Billy, it's...
It's Vernon.
Come on.
Oh.
I have work at 9:00.
Billy's his name, yeah?
He's wonderful, Vernon.
I'm seeing him again tonight.
What does Mr. Wonderful do?
He invents mechanical animals, and
he makes me feel like I can fly.
So, he's got prospects then?
See you later!
What?
You're fired.
<i>But Luna knew
that whatever obstacles</i>
<i>stood in her way, her
quest could not fail.</i>
<i>She had been greatly
inspired by the</i>
<i>words of the
wonderful traveler.</i>
<i>He would stand by her.</i>
Come on, Bella, what's wrong?
I'm not feeling well.
Ah, my son.
How long since your
last confession?
Bella's ill.
What's wrong with her?
I don't know.
She should snap out of it.
Right. Well, I'll
be sure to pass on
your words of
sympathy and support.
Come on, Bella, what's wrong?
Bella.
Come on, whatever's happened
with Mr. Mechanical Genius,
you've got to get
this garden finished.
O'Brien's going to
be here on Monday.
Bella.
Okay, Bella, I've got a
pain au chocolat here
and I'm going to eat it
here without a plate.
Yeah, there is no plate here.
Okay, well, don't say
I didn't warn you.
There's flakes going
all over the carpet here.
Leave me alone please.
How's the patient?
Oh...
Well, it's more than
medicine can fix.
Unless you've got something
for a broken heart.
I could have a word with her
if you think it might help.
But gently does it, yeah?
Yes, of course.
Bella, open the bloody door.
Don't make me ask you again.
You look a mess.
Alfie!
Vernon, give us a
couple of minutes.
Why don't you go and rustle up
some of that nonexistent
black pudding
that I saw in the
kitchen just now?
Okay, then.
I brought you a present.
Ask me that personal question.
Anything you like.
Have you ever been in love?
She was called Rose.
She was a free spirit.
She said I was a stuffed shirt.
You fell in love?
Yes.
It took about 20 minutes.
It took her a bit longer.
You were happy together?
As happy as two people
can be, I think.
She well and truly
unstuffed the shirt.
Then we traveled everywhere,
we shared everything.
She was a horticulturalist,
the best.
She wrote the book.
Yeah, she did.
She thought that "Arthur
Mildmay" sounded
more credible than
"Rose Milton".
In those days, it was impossible to
publish a female horticulturalist.
But she was a... She
was a bright spark.
And if she believed in something,
she gave it all she had.
She taught me how to live.
And then, she died all of a sudden
in childbirth.
Well, it was many years ago.
No warning, just...
Just gone, both of them.
But the garden, it's,
uh, helped me to cope.
Rose had a passion for life,
and I see the seeds of that in you.
And it upsets me greatly to see you
lying here, withering on the vine.
So, I say...
I say, grasp the nettle,
you stupid girl,
and stop feeling
sorry for yourself.
You're right.
I am stupid.
Stupid enough to fall
for a liar and a cheat.
And I thought he actually cared.
Well...
Did you know I represented my
country at clay pigeon shooting?
No.
Well, this boy you're talking
about, this robot-builder...
I think I may have to shoot him.
<i>Then one night, alone
in the forest,</i>
<i>Luna resolved to find
the magic flowers herself,</i>
<i>even if it meant
confronting terrifying demons.</i>
<i>She had nothing left to lose.</i>
Oh, God.
What the hell is she doing?
Everything else is wrecked.
We'll never fix it in time.
I don't care about your hay fever,
we've got work to do.
Here she comes.
You know, I told you that
in some parts of the world,
they celebrate when it rains.
Well, we think it
would be healthy if
we celebrated this
little storm, too.
"Celebrate"?
The garden's ruined, I'm ruined.
No, it's been the
making of you, Bella.
Trees blew down, Hedges blew down,
but you saved the one thing
that needed to be saved.
Anyway, enough of this.
We think you should have a day off.
Yeah, our treat.
I'm not exactly in the mood.
Oh, come on, have the day to
yourself, cheer yourself up.
So, off you go.
You're both mad.
People in glass houses, Bella.
Well, that's settled then. So, off
you go. Milly will go with you.
Anything to keep that doctor away
from me.
<i>I may roam</i>
<i>On land or sea or foam</i>
There you go. To the left there.
<i>You always hear me
singing this song</i>
<i>Show me the way to go home...</i>
Oh, perfect.
It's very dark in here.
What?
Hello, Bella.
- Hi, Bella.
- Hi, Bella.
We've been working all day
to get the pond ready for the fish.
It looks wonderful.
- Come on, come on.
- All right, look at this.
Look, I've got some of these
for you, and some for you,
- and some for you if you want.
- Oh. Yay.
All right, now,
just feed the fish.
And make sure
they don't bite your hands off.
Oh, they're just beautiful!
Lovely!
- Has she been drinking?
- Yes.
- Be nice to her.
- Of course.
Okay.
All right, come on,
sit down, everybody.
Who else wants a drink?
Oh, please.
- Oh! There we go.
- Okay. White.
Cheers!
<i>You didn't have to do this.</i>
Thank you. Again.
The pleasure, Miss
Brown, is all mine.
I'm so honored you gave me that
book. Now I know the story.
No, I only lent it to you.
When I'm pushing up the daisies,
then you can have it.
In that case, I don't want it.
<i>Bring me sunshine</i>
Care to dance?
Oh, don't be stupid.
<i>Bring me laughter all the while</i>
<i>In this world where we live</i>
<i>There should be more happiness</i>
<i>So much joy you can give</i>
<i>To each brand-new bright tomorrow</i>
<i>Make me happy through the years</i>
Do you think this is good enough?
We're about to find
out, Miss Brown.
Excuse me.
Gideon O'Brien, the landlord.
Miss Brown is popular
with the male of the species.
Bella!
Ah, Mr. O'Brien, welcome.
Come on through.
Vernon Kelly, the
tenant's boyfriend.
What?
Bella?
I'm impressed,
and I'm not ashamed to admit it.
Obviously, I received
no written request
for the insertion
of a water feature,
and the keeping of livestock.
But I'm prepared to overlook it
given the professional nature
of the work undertaken.
Okay, great.
Well, that does it then.
So, that only leaves one matter
outstanding, the rent increase.
What are you talking about,
what rent increase?
If she wants to stay, she'll
have to pay an increased figure
in line with the
new market value,
Section 23 of the
contract, watertight.
That's why our legal system
is revered the world over.
I can forward you the necessary
paperwork if you'd like.
This is her home now.
She's done all of this work,
you can't just do that.
Allow me to talk to Mr. O'Brien.
- What are you doing here?
- Come on.
All right?
He won't be bothering Bella again.
Why, what did you say to him?
Who are you?
I'm Billy, I'm looking for Bella.
She's not expecting me,
I'm a few days late.
Hmm.
Married? Well, of
course I'm not
married. But why
does she think that?
She saw you all over some woman.
Yes, you stood her up, you weasel.
No, I told you I had an accident,
that's why I couldn't be there.
I've been in hospital and I...
- I couldn't get her number.
- You got her address.
I got it this morning from the...
From the Adopt A Duck Society.
"The Adopt A Duck Society. "
Look, I didn't know
she had a boyfriend, all right?
She doesn't have a boyfriend.
Why didn't you call her?
- He's already answered that.
- Yeah, I know that.
I'm trying to test him out,
see if he changes his answer.
What are your intentions
towards Bella?
I like her very much.
All right, now, I appreciate
that you two are close family,
but, really, I think I'd rather
tell Bella to her face
before you two interrogate
me any further.
William Tranter.
You have embarrassed
and humiliated me.
Now leave
before I let Vernon loose on you.
Bella...
Bella, we've had a
word with young Billy.
He says he isn't married, and for
what it's worth, I believe him.
I saw him with someone else
the day we were supposed to meet.
But, Bella, I was hit
by a bus that day.
That's why I wasn't there.
I know what I saw.
Oh, that must have been George.
I know your face, Billy.
It wasn't your brother, it was you.
No, he's only seven minutes
younger, Bella, we're identical.
- You're a twin?
- Triplet, actually.
Yes, and each of us all separated
by a whole seven minutes.
Actually, quite the ladies' man,
young George.
Oh.
You know, I would never
lie to you, Bella.
I...
Well, actually, I've
just been telling your
father and your
grandfather here that...
- I'm not her father!
- "Grandfather"?
You must believe me, Bella.
I've got a couple of friends
playing in the park tonight.
I was rather hoping
that you might be my guest.
Bella?
Bella?
Bella, are you there?
I'm here.
You're a bit accident prone.
I do seem to be around you.
So, the concert?
I'll come and get you
at half past 6:00.
And I'll be sure not to hit
any buses on the way.
Promise.
Perfect.
I love it, it's brilliant.
But why didn't you show me before?
Hello?
Right, yes, of course.
Hello?
Come on, girls.
<i>My dear Bella,</i>
<i>as per my somewhat
pedantic instructions,</i>
<i>I assume that you are
all in your garden,</i>
<i>which I hope is looking
as good as I expect.</i>
<i>Vernon should be planting
a rather splendid Japanese maple.</i>
<i>Make sure that he
packs the earth down</i>
<i>and gives it a proper
drink regularly.</i>
<i>The reason for planting the tree
is, I admit, a selfish one.</i>
<i>I quite like the idea of you
telling your progeny</i>
<i>of this objectionable old fool who
used to potter around the garden.</i>
<i>So, it is planted for you,</i>
<i>and future generations of</i>
<i>spectacularly
dysfunctional artists.</i>
<i>The boring details are, as ever,
in the hands of solicitors,</i>
<i>but the bare fact is that
my home is now Vernon's.</i>
<i>He and the girls need the space
far more than I ever did.</i>
<i>You'll be able to keep an eye
an the daft bugger</i>
<i>because I'm giving you your flat.</i>
<i>I owned it.</i>
<i>The unfortunate Mr. O'Brien
was merely acting on my behalf.</i>
<i>Or should I say, on
behalf of the old Alfie.</i>
<i>You were a wonderful pupil,</i>
<i>and a dearly treasured friend.</i>
<i>You helped me remember
the good things.</i>
<i>Yours sincerely, Alfred Stevenson.</i>
<i>"And as Luna drank in the view,</i>
"she was filled with
something quite magical.
"In the distance, she could see the
southern shore of the Caspian Sea,
"which isn't a sea at
all, but, actually,
the biggest lake
in the world.
"Luna thanked the traveler.
<i>"Oh, it's nothing. You haven't
done the hard part yet.</i>
<i>"Really?" said Luna.</i>
<i>"Now, you must believe,"
said the traveler,</i>
<i>"and he pushed Luna
off the mountain.</i>
<i>"Luna screamed to the traveler,
'Why did you do that? I can't fly.</i>
<i>"Says who?' he replied.</i>
<i>"And the wind lifted Luna off
the mountain and she soared.</i>
<i>"Can you see them now?'
yelled the traveler.</i>
<i>"Yes," said Luna,</i>
<i>"gliding through the air with the
wind whistling between her wings.</i>
<i>"I can see thousands of them.</i>
<i>"And for the first time
in a hundred years,</i>
<i>"the traveler allowed
him self a smile. "</i>
