Are you sure you don't
want some coffee?
No, I'm good.
You sure you don't want
to go back to the bedroom?
No, I'm good.
Yeah, you are!
Shh! Keep your voice down.
I don't want Milo to hear us.
Why? Are you ashamed of me?
Yes.
Look, earlier in my career,
I got involved with a co-worker,
word got out, and it
changed everything.
Well, I don't care
what people think.
Yeah, I know you don't,
because the guys
will be all, "nice work,"
and do that thing where
you pound fists and blow it up.
What is that?
Jude, nobody does that anymore.
I'm just saying,
it's different for women.
It changes the way
people think of you
or even look at you.
Message received.
It'll just be
our little secret.
Promise?
You have my word.
Hey, morning.
You're up early.
Yep, just reading the news
as per "yooszh."
Man, did you see this article
about the earthquake
in east Asia? 8.6.
No, but I did see
this article of clothing
on the bathroom floor...
34-c.
Who was it?
Chick from the bar?
No, no.
She's really smart and classy.
But I can't tell you her name.
Why?
Do I know this person?
Well, I can't tell you
because it would be awkward
the next time you run into her.
So I do know this person.
No, again, I can't tell you
because it would make things
weird at the office.
Oh, my God!
You're sleeping with Jude?
Damn it.
How'd you do that?
Look, man, you cannot
tell anyone, all right?
This is a big deal to her,
and I don't want
to mess this up.
Lips are sealed.
Jude, huh? Nice work.

So, where do you guys
want to go for lunch?
Burgers? Chinese?
Italian?
Listen up.
PJ's coming in today.
So we've got to focus on work,
minimize the chit chat,
and be ready for inspection.
Oh, crap.
I need to clear
my browser history.
So, Italian?
Well, I might not eat
till next week
after the breakfast
this one cooked.
Oh, stop.
You stop...
Being the perfect roommate.
This rascal made me
a veggie frittata
with truffled home fries.
He even left me
a little note in my pocket
that says,
"have a nice day."
Ah, good morning, ladies.
Milo, back again.
You're gonna be the first person
that doesn't work here
to get employee of the month.
Ah. Funny banter
that also hurts my feelings.
I miss this place.
How can you miss it?
You show up every day.
Well, today,
there's an actual reason.
After much consideration,
I have finally selected the film
for tomorrow's sixth annual
bad movie night.
Drumroll, please.
May I present to you...
"Showgirls."
Wow.
Now, the rules of the evening
are...
Every time we see boobies,
we drink.
Oh, my God.
We are going to die.
Check this out, bitches.
So, I'm interviewing
the Knicks city dancers
for my article on how to
seduce a cheerleader.
One of the girls felt
I was trying to seduce her
and gave me these...
Four tickets
for tomorrow's game.
Floor seats, bitches.
Could you please stop
calling us bitches?
One for you, you, you, and me.
Oh, wait.
Tomorrow's bad movie night.
We can't miss it.
Can't you just watch a bad
movie on a different night?
Oh, yeah.
You know, I mean,
traditions are overrated, right?
You know... maybe we should
just move Christmas to August.
And while we're at it,
why don't we just
dissolve the government
and live like animals?
Now, wait. Hang on.
The game starts at 7:00.
It should be over by 10:00,
which means we're watching
"Showgirls" by 10:30 tops.
Everybody wins.
Well, not exactly everybody,
because I still don't...
Everybody wins, bitches!
- All right.
- Let's do this!
Yeah!
You know what would be great?
Some more of those strawberry
blintzes you made last week
with a little powdered sugar.
- Those did make you smile.
- Oh.
If I could offer
one tiny critique...
I like paprika,
but it doesn't like me.
Oh, my God.
I think I got it.
The panini press
I ordered for you?
No, no.
This great apartment I found.
You're looking at apartments?
How come you didn't
say anything?
Well, I didn't want to jinx it.
I'm gonna take one last look at the
place and then sign the lease.
- Wow. You sound pretty excited.
- I am.
I mean, I've been sleeping
on your couch for a month.
I store my clothes
under your sink.
That's no way
for a man to live.
Well, it's a way.
I'm thinking
if we lose half these bulbs,
we can cut 15%
off our power bill.
Plus, it'll give
a cool kind of cave vibe,
like maybe a bear's in here.
Get me price quotes
on an office bear.
PJ.
It's good to see you.
Thought, uh,
you might have heard,
but, uh, your daughter and I
are taking a little break.
- Little break?
- Mm-hmm.
She's halfway to North Korea
with Dennis Rodman.
Now, where's that sweaty
little Cabbage Patch kid
I hired to run this place?
Hey, Jeff, is it cool
if I eat your cake?
Just say something
if it's not cool.
You're the best, Jeff.
Oh, look.
We caught one in the wild.
Oh...
Mr. Jordan,
um, what a nice surprise.
I didn't expect
to see you so soon.
You should expect me anywhere,
anytime, with anyone.
I'm like a handsome
airborne illness.
Very handsome.
Three steps back, ewok.
I'm a married man.
Little heads up...
I'm gonna be making some
changes around here,
so, uh, I wouldn't get
too comfortable in that
office if I were you.
And now, like a deaf guy
playing musical chairs, I'm out.
Uh, sir?
I just said I'm a deaf guy.
Damn it.
The printer's down.
Again? They really need
to replace that thing.
I-is that how you solve
all your problems?
Uh, what if that old printer
has only been here
for two months
and already increased
ad sales by 15%?
And what if that printer
doesn't have any savings
because it spent it all
on vintage toys?
Did you two
ever think about that?
I got to be honest and say no.
I rest my case.
Did you hear that?
Yeah.
I feel like the printer's
a metaphor for something.
No, I mean he said, "you two."
Have you told anyone about us?
No. No, I promise.
No one at the office knows.
Are you sure?
Because I feel like
Lloyd was giving me a weird
look in the break room.
Lazy-eyed Lloyd?
That's the only look he's got.
Am I right?
Yeah, this place is amazing.
And it's mine.
I can walk around
naked if I want.
There you are.
So, what do you think?
I think that lady New York
finally parted her thighs
for old Neal Bradford.
What?
I meant I like it.
Wow! This bedroom
has a river view!
I got to say, it's,
uh, it's pretty great
what you're doing
for my friend here.
Your friend had perfect
credit, great references.
So, really,
it was an easy decision.
Great references? Huh.
Yeah, it's amazing
what a good lawyer
can make go away these days.
What do you mean?
Oh, I shouldn't say anything.
Case files are sealed now.
Well, what did he do?
Well, according
to 7 out of 12 jurors,
nothing.
Important thing is,
the doctors say he's ready
to become a productive member
of society again.
Fingers crossed.
I see.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
They never did find
those hitchhikers.
But no bodies, no crime.
Am I right?
Man, those closets are huge.
You could fit
like 10 people in there.
Hey, guys. It's me again.
Saw the game ended
over an hour ago,
and you're still not here.
So hope you're not
dead in a ditch...
Although that's the only
excuse I'll accept.
It's Milo.
Finally.
Question... what has eight legs
and likes to party?
Me.
The eight legs was a mislead.
Oh.
Myron, what are you doing here?
Well, I overheard
there was movie night
and perhaps some drinking.
And the truth is,
things are looking
pretty bleak at the office
for the man you see
before you...
Myron.
Um, well,
would you like to come in
and watch "Showgirls"?
Yes. Yes, I would.
Boobies!
Boob!
Ohh.
How many boobs have we seen?
17.
17? How do you know that?
Well,
I'm like a titty rain man.
So, you plan this event
for your friends,
and they didn't even bother
to show up?
Yeah, I've become the odd
man out ever since I quit.
They've got inside jokes,
they go do stuff without me,
and now that Tyler and Jude
are sleeping together,
- I don't even...
- Whoa.
They're sleeping together?
You can't tell anyone...
Especially Myron.
Shh.
I'm Myron.
Shh.
Great game.
Milo. There you are.
Sorry we're late,
but it wasn't our fault.
The game went
to double overtime.
Did you know
when you get floor seats
you get to go
to the V.I.P. Bar?
So we watched the second
overtime down there.
And after the Knicks won,
the players came in.
Tyson Chandler bought
everybody a round,
- and then he...
- Stop!
I find your story pathetic
and somewhat meandering.
Myron,
what are you even doing here?
Well, I'll tell you
what he's doing here.
He's here honoring the tradition
of bad movie night,
and he wasn't even invited.
I was just lonely.
Yeah!
Well, Milo, can't we just
watch the movie now?
No, we cannot,
because the best
breasts are behind us.
Shame on you all.
This man had
a nice evening planned.
Yeah!
And where were you?
Out gallivanting?!
With your shiny jerseys
and your knickerbockers?
Yeah!
It's bad enough
that he feels like a loser
'cause he stupidly quit his job.
Yeah.
But now it's even worse
because Jude and Tyler...
Ooh!
I almost...
I almost said it.
You almost said that they were
sleeping together!
Why's everybody so quiet?
You told them?
No, I just told Milo,
and it was only because
he found your bra.
Yeah, 'cause I'm the only woman
in New York who wears a bra.
My God, I wish that were true.
You guys are a thing?
When did this start?
Oh!
Tell me what happens.
Thanks a lot, Tyler.
I'm out of here.
Sideboob.
Should we do half a shot?
Yes.
Hey, Milo, guess what you are.
Wait for it. Here it is.
You're a dick.
It was an accident.
It wasn't an accident.
You're pissed because you think
you're being replaced.
Th... that's
completely not true.
Didn't you just say
those exact words to me?
Shh!
I hope you're happy, Milo.
You ruined my relationship.
Okay, maybe "relationship"
is the wrong word
because it's new, and we're
not putting labels on it,
but whatever it was,
you wrecked it!
Wah!
I lost the apartment.
Oh! That's terrible.
Yeah.
Apparently someone implied
that I was a serial killer.
Oh!
I was kidding.
Come on, man.
You don't want a landlady
who can't take a joke.
Why would you do that?
I...Don't know.
I think you do.
I think you sabotaged me
'cause you didn't want to lose
your frittata-cookin'
man servant.
Sabotage you?
I've been letting you sleep
on my couch for a month.
I had a chance to start over,
and you killed it!
Hey. Do you want to sleep
somewhere else?
Yes!
That's the point!
Fine!
I don't need you.
You think you're the only man
I can get to cook me breakfast?
This city is lousy with them!
I somehow feel
like this is maybe my fault.
- Morning.
- Morning.
Wait!
That was a reflex.
I take it back.
I hope your morning sucks.
Neal. Neal!
Jude.
Don't even start.
Okay, but can I just ask
one question?
Tyler, you don't get it.
I asked you for one thing,
and you couldn't do it.
I know. I'm sorry.
It was an accident.
Doesn't matter.
It's done.
And now nobody's gonna
take me seriously.
Well, nobody takes me seriously,
and I seem to be thriving.
Well, good for you.
Look, my friends
aren't gonna tell anyone.
Oh, please.
You know it's gonna get out.
I might as well just stand up
and shout, "hi, everyone."
"It's me, the new girl.
Guess what...
Tyler and I are having sex."
Uh, Jude.
I haven't been that drunk
since my three weeks
as a high school principal.
What the hell
happened last night?
It's all just a blur
of nipples and tears.
Sounds like my sophomore year
at Wellesley.
Well, PJ's gonna be here
any minute.
And then I'll be out of a job.
I understand that white rhinos
are endangered.
That's why I want to kill one
now before they're all gone.
Good God, son.
You look like something
I just had lasered off my back.
All right, decision time.
Where's the girl?
Yo.
You're lovely, but I
meant the new girl.
Right here, sir.
How would you like Myron's job?
Wow.
You could at least
do this privately.
Wait. You want me
to be the editor in chief?
You're smart, you've
got great credentials,
and I've heard you're sleeping
your way through the office.
I respect your hustle.
Wow.
How can I say no?
Say the word "snow"
without the "s"?
But I'd rather
you accept the job.
- Thank you, sir.
- Mm-hmm.
Myron, you can pack up
your office.
All right.
I'll go.
But mark my words.
You haven't heard
the last of Myron Sterbakov.
Yeah, I'm promoting you.
Because I will be right here
by your side.
And I will never stop
loving you.
I love that you've
increased our ad revenue.
Keep it up.
You are now the very
furry editorial director
of Jordan Media.
Thank you, sir.
You won't regret this.
See that I don't.
You promised me that job.
I promised you a lot of things.
Mama, I've got big news.
Wake up Nana and the captain,
and put me on speaker.
Whatever it is, Gibbs,
it's not gonna change
what you did.
Would you give me a chance?
Hello.
Ms. Kosavich?
What are you doing here?
I told her I made
all that stuff up.
I didn't want you to move out.
Not just because of the
cooking, but because...
Well,
I liked having you around.
I thought I was imposing.
Well, you were.
Then I got used to it.
Point is, I was being selfish.
And you're right.
Sleeping on the couch
is no way for a
grown man to live.
So I asked her to come here
so we can work something out.
So there's still a chance?
Oh, I don't know.
I've got 20 people
on a waiting list,
so your offer's gonna
have to be pretty sweet.
Well, what do you have in mind?
Let me put it this way...
I'm old, but I'm not dead.
Okay, what does that mean?
I think you know.
Uh...
I'm sorry, but that's
not on the table.
Oh, yes, it is.
In fact, that's
where I prefer it.
Guess I should go check out
my new office.
Still can't believe this.
I know.
It's like you're my boss.
It's not like I'm your boss.
I am your boss.
So, what does this mean for us?
I don't know.
Oh.
I guess it means
that from now on, I'm on top.
Tyler, I was wrong.
Actually, Milo,
it turned out...
Let me finish.
I betrayed your confidence,
and as a result,
I publicly embarrassed
your lady.
Yeah, but... and the only
way to make that right
is to publicly embarrass myself
right here in this office.
Wait.
What were you gonna say?
Nothing. Go ahead.
Hey, everybody.
Uh, I want to show
you something.
But, first, let me remind you
that it's cold in here.
Actually, buddy,
maybe this is a bad idea.
Trust me.
It's the only way.
So, he doesn't shave his face,
but he shaves there.
Well, he's not trying
to make his face look bigger.
Whew!
So, we even?
That would have been better
if you hadn't worn
my trench coat, but sure.
Milo, how would you like
your old job back?
How can you make that happen?
You didn't tell him?
I tried,
although, admittedly,
not very hard.
I got promoted,
and I need to hire
someone to replace me.
You're always saying that you got
more work done on your novel
when you had a job.
Right, but I just...
- Showed everyone your penis?
- I saw.
And I appreciate the gesture,
but let's move past it.
So, yes or no?
Well, can I think about it?
- Nope.
- Then yes.
The chia-head
is home.
Let's get you some pants
and go celebrate.
Nice hire, boss.
Permission to give you
a strictly professional thank-you hug?
Granted.
Can I grab your butt?
Denied.
Wow.
I haven't gotten it up
without pills in 15 years,
but that gets me going.
Thank you, ladies.
Three celebrities
you'd punch in the neck
if there were
no repercussions...
Go.
Justin Bieber,
the daughter on "Homeland,"
and Honey Boo Boo.
Those are three children.
Yep.
You don't have a problem
punching three children?
They didn't have a problem
ruining my 2013.
Hey, Gibbs, by the way,
did you really have sex
with Neal's landlady?
Of course not.
She was just looking
for a little companionship.
We had lunch,
we took a walk in the park...
It was all very innocent.
Then why won't you look at us?
I'm not ready.
Look, whatever you did, Gibbs,
it worked, so thank you.
She even knocked
50 bucks off the rent.
It's not enough.
Who's that?
- Jude.
- Oh, yeah.
How's it gonna be
dating your boss?
Uh, great.
I can't see any downside.
Really?
'Cause I can't see any upside.
No, come on.
Think about it.
I can roll into the office
whenever I want.
No, you're gonna
have to show up early
because she won't want
to play favorites.
And if I buy her lingerie,
it'll be a business expense.
Only if she wears it to work.
And if we break up,
I can sue her.
Face it, Tyler.
You're screwed.
Not at all.
Nothing has changed.
Here, listen to this
text she sent me.
It's adorable.
"Your lunch was over
20 minutes ago.
Get your ass
back to the office."
That's sexy, right?
You know what, though?
I think I'm gonna go.
She got that
boy on a short leash.
Poor guy.
You want to knock
another 100 bucks off your rent?
What does she want you to do?
It's what she wants us to do.
