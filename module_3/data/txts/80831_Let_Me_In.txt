we'll find them too, believe me.
What's the matter?
Is that it?

Jesus, Mary, and Joseph...
There is sin and evil in the world,
and we're enjoined by scripture and
the Lord Jesus to oppose it with allour might.
Our nation, too, has a
legacy of evil with which it must deal.
The glory of this land has been its capacity
for transcending the moral evils of our past...

They were gonna push me in a hole.
In the ice.
So I got a big stick
and I hit him in the head really hard.
He had to go to the hospital
I almost got suspended.
But I did it. What you said.
I stood up to them.
Owen...
...Yeah?
- Hey... You wanna go somewhere...?
- Where?
“ENTER UNDER PENALTY OF DEATH”
- It's pretty cool huh?
- Yes.
This this kid who used to live
in the building. Tommy.
He would come down here and drink and
smoke with his high school friends, and..
And when they weren't here,
He would play ping-pong with me.
He was really cool
Then he had to move away.
I kinda like it here...
It's cool...
I don't think any of the adults
know about it... just us.
So... what did you want to do down
here...?
I think I have an idea...
close your eyes...
keep them closed
Let's make a pact.

What are you talking about, pal...?
-...Can people be evil??
- Where are you getting this...?
From your mother...?

All right. please have her call me when
she gets back, alright...?
Well.

...Yeah...
You have a good

And I'm sorry about the last couple months,
but I'll see you real soon, okay?
- I promise! Maybe next weekend.
- Okay...
I love you!
Can I come in...?
...You have to say it...
...You can... come in..
Are you a vampire...?
I... need blood. To live.

Sure.
Sorry to bother you.
..How's... she doing...?
It's been... quite a night
They had to give her
almost six pints of blood...
We're still waiting to
see if her body rejects it.
I won't keep you too long.
I just want...
I need to ask you about the
description you gave. Of the little girl.
You said she had long blonde hair
was around twelve years old,
and wasn't wearing shoes...
- Right?
- Right!
Have you ever seen this man?
He's a suspect in a murder investigation.
Maybe... Looks like a guy
in our building
Did he have a daughter? Like the
girl you described?
I don't know.
I’ve only seen him a few times...
Why?
You think this is related to the murder case?
Maybe. I began to believe that two of
victims were part of a Satanic cult.
What?
We found another body few days ago...
Same M.O. The victim was
completely drained of blood...
But there were bite marks on the
victim's neck. Small ones. Like a child's
Jesus Christ!
Jesus Christ!
Virginia! God!
Jesus Christ!
No!
