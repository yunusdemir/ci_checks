No, no, no. Don't feed the dog, darling.
Thanks, babe.
-You slept late.
-Yeah, I need to go.
What you got going today?
I've got to finish up some curtains
for Saturday,
and Nat and Cam are coming over.
-With the kids?
-Yeah.
Cammie said she just needed
to get out of the house.
Tell Nat to take it easy on her.
Cam can hold her own.
We need to send in the deposit
for the beach condo.
I love you.
-Just write the check, babe, okay?
-Okay. Bye.
No more food.
You, eat.
Yeah, let's keep
going with that bit.
It'll go another 10 feet.
We won't get the gravel
pack down today.
Why not?
Clouds.
We're gonna have to call it.
Happy hour starts at 5:00, Dewart.
Not if it's raining.
-Ready?
-Yeah.
They were just drinking and laughing.
And, oh, my God,
it was like I was being in a museum
and I saw the progress from apes to men.
I saw it. I saw the future.
Dewart, that was him,
that was going to be him in 20 years.
Let me tell you, you laugh.
You laugh. But this little one in your arms
is gonna be shuffling in a bar just like them.
-Yep.
-No.
Don't listen to her.
-Hannah!
-What?
-You guys okay?
-Yeah.
No. Don't touch.
You understand?
Okay. Come here.
Go play.
Hey, DJ. Bring the girls inside.
What?
-It's not my fault. I told you.
-Yeah, all right.
All right, I'm calling it. Shut it down.
-Bye, guys. Thank you for coming.
-I'll call you about the Lions Club supper.
-Okay. Love you.
-Bye, Sam.
Bye, Hannah!
Can you sign
S-T-O-R-M?
Storm.
I gotta get home.
Nat and me been
looking into a threesome.
We've been chatting with
this girl online from Canton.
Yeah. Big old girl.
What's big?
She's about 250, 275.
She can't be no
taller than five foot.
Shit, man.
I don't see me and Sam
getting into something like that.
No. I don't guess you would.
You got a good life, Curtis.
I'm serious.
I think that's the best compliment
you can give a man,
take a look at his life and say, "That's good.
"That guy's doing something right."
Well, it ain't always so easy.
Hell, I know that.
Shit. I gotta go.
Good night.
Hey, baby.
She do all right today?
She was fine.
She's still not playing
with the others, though.
She can't connect.
Honey, you gotta clean up that trash pile
in the back.
She fished out a board
that had nails on it.
I'll get to it this weekend.
I still take off my boots,
so I won't wake her up.
I still whisper.
Curtis?
-What?
-Did you hear me?
You got to be home, showered,
ready to walk out the door by 6:00 tonight.
What's wrong?
Nothing. I just want her to eat her breakfast
and stop playing with the damn dog.
She's fine down there. She had toast already.
-All right.
-What?
Hannah. Come here. Hannah.
-Curtis?
-What?
I'm late.
-You didn't eat anything.
-It's okay.
I didn't say you had control
over the weather, Russell.
What I did say was that the top shelf
has got to be cleared by the 15th.
That's non-negotiable.
Curtis?
Curtis? Where we at on that East 82nd site?
Yesterday slowed us down.
We couldn't get the second pilot hole drilled.
It rained for two hours yesterday.
Two hours,
and our entire schedule went in the toilet?
We lose the permit
if you're not out of there, end of day.
-Yes, sir.
-End of day, Curtis.
All right. Valerie tells me
that the father-son pancake cook-off...
Hey, I gotta make a stop
before we head out there.
-Think we got time?
-Yeah, there's time.
Shit.
Son of a bitch.
-We stripped that bit.
-Yeah.
Well, bring it up. We gotta reset it.
Curtis!
-You ever see birds fly like that?
-What?
Damn it.
Damn it.
Come on, we gotta go.
Jesus.
Honey, I can really use a shower.
Hi.
So if you continue with the basic vocabulary,
this will allow you to communicate
with your children better.
Between the ages of four and seven,
the focus is more on the sign.
And then later,
we'll begin adding the alphabet
as more of a support system.
Now, in ASL,
the male sign is signed at the forehead area.
For example, "father,"
is signed up here like this.
Father. Very good.
-You're not sorry.
-I am sorry.
Well, you stink. You smell really bad.
I think I smell good.
Do I smell good?
See? Maybe I should marry her instead.
Stop.
Man.
You okay?
Shit!
You okay?
You're okay.
It's okay.
No!
Hannah!
Hannah!
Hannah!
Hannah!
Here, honey. Put on your shoes.
-Good, you're up.
-Yeah.
Honey, you're soaked.
I've felt better.
I guess we can stay home if we need to.
Where you going?
It's Saturday.
I was going to take Hannah to my booth.
Yeah.
You look really sick, honey.
I'm all right. It's just a cold or something.
Let me get you some Advil.
Don't worry about it. Just go. I'll be fine.
You sure?
Better already.
Okay. I got my phone if you need anything.
Don't forget, Sunday lunch is here tomorrow.
If you're sick, we should cancel.
I'll be all right.
Okay, we'll talk later.
Come on. Let's go.
-You sure?
-Honey, please.
How much you asking for this pillow?
This pillow is $15.
That's more than I want to spend.
This is all hand stitched.
It takes a really long time.
That's why I charge that.
I'll give you $7 for it.
I can't go that low.
Well, that's my offer.
How about 10?
I'll give you $8, but it's in change.
That's fine.
Lucky for you she likes to count change.
Red.
Come on.
Get in. Good boy.
I'm sorry about this, buddy.
We just gotta work it like this
for a while, okay?
While rescue workers made several attempts
to reach the family,
-Walter Jacobs' wife and brother-in-law died.
-That's what I don't understand.
If he didn't do anything,
why did you put him out back?
What?
Did you hear me?
I said if he didn't do anything,
why did you have to put him outside?
I just wanted him to be outside for a while.
He's your dog.
He's always been an inside dog.
He's my dog, that's why he's outside.
Look,
right now with Hannah and everything,
I just think it'd be better.
-Hannah loves Red.
-Hold on.
...the gas cloud spread across
their six-acre property.
The only way off their land
was across the train tracks,
which were blocked by wreckage.
I tried using some wet rags
and some towels to breathe through,
but that just seemed to make it worse.
While rescue workers made several attempts
to reach the family,
Walter Jacobs' wife and brother-in-law died
in the home.
Jacobs survived despite enduring 1 1 hours
of exposure to the gas cloud...
You hearing this?
It's awful.
Eleven hours.
No way out.
Hannah.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey! Hey!
-Babe?
-Yeah?
You got the number for Dr. Shannan?
You're still not feeling good?
Yeah, we got the number?
Yeah, baby, but he'll be closed today.
Right. Yeah, I'll call tomorrow.
Honey, if you're not feeling good,
-we got to take you...
-No. Stop!
Okay.
Do you want me to cancel lunch today?
Shit.
-What is that?
-I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I just...
I got a sore throat.
I'm sorry I'm taking it out on you.
I was gonna leave Hannah with you
so I could go to church,
but I'm not gonna with you like this.
It's fine. I'll be fine.
-No. She needs breakfast.
-I got it.
I'm sorry that you feel bad,
but you need to drop the attitude.
Come on. Just go.
-What's wrong with you?
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Just go.
Hannah's in the den. We have cereal for her.
We're going out.
We're going out. Okay?
It's okay. It's okay.
You stay put, okay?
Let's just start.
Let's all join hands for the blessing.
-Where the hell have you been?
-I know. I'm sorry. I had to run an errand.
-You're really late.
-I know.
You didn't even bring your cell phone.
Missed you at church this morning, Curtis.
Dad.
He knows what to do
if he wants me to stop asking.
Was it a good service?
It was. It was good work.
I'm thinking about cleaning up
that storm shelter out back.
Curtis?
-Curtis, how you doing, bud?
-Hey, Doc.
-How's my girl?
-She's good.
That's good to hear.
Tilt your head back for me.
I don't have a cold.
-Did she get that down wrong?
-No, I just told her that.
So what's the problem?
I've been having...
I've been having some trouble sleeping.
I was hoping
you could give me something for it.
How long's this been going on?
About four nights now.
You're not sleeping at all?
Well, some, but real restless.
Well, I think four nights
is a little too soon to tell.
My advice would be to not eat
or drink anything after 8:00 at night.
Cut back on any alcoholic drinks,
tobacco, caffeine.
Get some daily exercise.
Well, I think...
-I think I might need to try some medication.
-Why do you say that?
The reason I've been having trouble sleeping
is these dreams I've been having.
I didn't think it was anything at first,
but then the other day I woke up
and the bed was wet.
-You urinated in your bed?
-Yeah.
Couple days before that,
I had a dream that my dog attacked me
and it took all day
for the pain in my arm to go away.
You been out to see your mother lately?
It's been about a month.
Okay.
Okay. This is a prescription
for a pretty mild sedative.
It's non-habit forming,
but I'm only giving you enough
for a few days anyway.
Take it and see if it helps. In the meantime,
this is the number of a good friend of mine
in Columbus. He's a psychiatrist.
It's a drive, but he's the best I know.
Okay.
I'll give him a call
and let him know you'll be down to see him.
All right.
-Hey, Dewart.
-What you say, Curtis?
Not much.
They want us
to get a pilot hole drilled by lunch.
I figure worse comes to worse,
we can eat on the rig.
Yeah, we'll get it done. Weekend all right?
Yeah. Same old shit.
No. No, I need the name of the specialist
whose diagnosis you'll accept.
No. Look it, I've told you this twice. Please.
Just get me the name
and/or the approval code.
Okay.
All right. And the phone? All right.
Great. Well, thank you very much.
All right, this is the name
and the phone number of the specialist
who the insurance company approves of.
Just call and make an appointment.
Now if this doctor signs off,
you should have the implant procedure
fully covered.
I'm sorry it took so long.
Can I give you a hug?
It's fine. It's fine.
You know, your husband's company actually
has very good insurance when it kicks in.
Not a lot ofjobs offer policies half as good.
You're very lucky.
That's okay. We have your insurance on file.
-That'll be $47.64.
-What's the co-pay?
That is your co-pay.
Hey.
I love you.
I love you too.
I have good news.
Green? How about a red?
It was like talking to a sane person for once.
She made one phone call. That's it.
I've been trying that 800 number
for weeks. You.
It's great. It's great.
Hey, Hannah.
Are you excited?
We're gonna get you some help.
How do you say, sign, "excited"?
Like this.
Excited? Yeah?
All right. What've we got here?
I got to do you.
Honey, look at this one.
It's a 2-1, and it sits directly on the beach.
Wouldn't that be great? We wouldn't have
to worry about Hannah crossing traffic.
-What's the rent?
-$899 a week.
That sounds real nice.
You sleep well?
Yeah. I did.
You look like you're feeling better.
You want me to come there and do it for you?
Jesus.
Hey, how much food you think you'd need
to live on for a week?
-What do you mean?
-I mean to stay alive.
What do you think you'd need?
-Not a lot.
-Yeah? You think?
I don't know.
You hear about people living for days
all the time off bark and melted snow.
I've never heard of that.
Shit, I don't know. You asked the question.
It's on there.
It's on. Come on.
Damn it.
What?
It sounds like thunder.
What sounds like thunder?
What's the matter with you, Curtis?
Curtis?
Where you going? Curtis, where you going?
-Curtis.
-Hey, Mom.
-Come in.
-Sure.
I'm gonna get some water.
You want some?
No.
Isn't she lovely?
-Mom?
-Yes?
I need to ask you something.
Do you remember what year
we brought you up here?
To the first place.
It was '86.
Yes. Because Kyle was going to be a senior.
-I was 10.
-Yes.
Can you remember what happened
before you got diagnosed?
-What do you mean?
-I mean...
I just want to know how it all started.
Before you had to leave.
I don't know.
I remember it was a real stressful time.
Your father was gone a lot,
and I couldn't handle things on my own.
Did you ever have any
dreams?
Like, bad dreams?
No. Nothing like that.
There was always...
There was always a panic
that took hold of me.
I thought people were watching me
and listening to me.
It's all right. It's fine.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Yeah. I'm fine.
May I have the number
for Dr. George Shannan?
Thanks.
Hi, is Dr. Shannan there?
May I speak with him?
This is Curtis LaForche.
Hey, Doc.
Yeah, sorry... Sorry to call you at home.
I just... I don't think I can make it
to Columbus to see that psychiatrist.
Yeah, it's just too far.
Is there somewhere local
you could send me?
Hey.
Hey.
Sorry I woke you up.
It's okay.
Where you been?
I went to see Mom.
Is she okay?
Yeah. I just wanted to check up on her.
You should've told me,
we would have gone with you.
No, that's okay.
Come to bed.
I will in a bit.
Well, you've kept up with the payments
on the house.
We've been good about that.
I gotta tell you, Curtis, banks aren't
loaning money the way they used to.
We've got you a loan today,
but the interest rates are variable.
We have to tie it to your house.
That's fine.
Curtis, I've known you a long time.
Financed your house for you, two vehicles.
I'm telling you,
this is a risky loan you're taking.
I need the money, John.
Okay.
-Hey.
-Hey.
Sorry I left you yesterday.
-Jim came by. I covered for you.
-Thanks.
-I need your help with the depth charts.
-Sure.
Fucking Nat put me in charge
of frying oysters for that Lions Club supper.
You need another burner?
Yeah, ifyou still got yours, I could use it.
Hey, you think you could help me
with something?
What do you need?
I'm gonna build out the tornado shelter
in my backyard. I could use some help.
The hell you wanna do that for?
Just needs to be done.
What do you need?
I figure I'll do it on a Saturday,
borrow some equipment from work.
-You sure about that?
-Yeah, I just need a backhoe, a hauler.
I'll rent the rest.
-Yeah. Whatever. I'll help.
-Thanks.
-You all right, man?
-What do you mean?
I just don't wanna see you fuck up.
I'm not.
Come in.
-Hi.
-Hello.
-Have a seat. I'm Kendra.
-Curtis.
Okay.
I'm gonna start
by asking you some questions.
Okay. I already answered
all the questions on the form.
Yeah, I know. I looked at them,
but I need to get a profile started on you.
Right. Well...
Out of the five possible symptoms
needed to be diagnosed with schizophrenia,
delusions, hallucinations,
disorganized speech,
disorganized behavior
and the negative symptoms,
I've had two.
Delusions and hallucinations.
So, I took this quiz in the back of the book.
I scored a five out of a possible 20.
Schizophrenia starts at 12. So...
They say it might be
a brief psychotic disorder.
Yeah. Whatever it is,
I need to know what to do
or what to get on
to get this thing under control.
Look. I'm a counselor.
Certified, but I'm not a psychiatrist.
I can't prescribe anything to you.
I can talk to you,
I can recommend where to send you,
but that's it.
Now, that said, if you want to talk, I'll listen.
For a lot of people, that's a good start.
Now you said here
that your mother was diagnosed
with paranoid schizophrenia in her 30s.
And you're at 35.
You wanna talk about that?
Yeah, I don't know my mother's symptoms.
I was just 10.
My brother was 17. And...
I don't know. She just left me in the car
in the parking lot
at the grocery store one day.
And she didn't come back.
And then they found her a week later
eating trash out of a dumpster
in Northern Kentucky.
My dad had to put her
in the State Hospital in Columbus.
And she's been in assisted living ever since.
Yep.
My dad raised me.
He died last April.
So tell me about these dreams.
I don't know what our schedule will be, but...
That's all right.
But I really do think you should
continue with the sign language.
And any additional therapies
that kids need for the cochlear implant.
-Absolutely.
-Okay.
-Good night.
-Good night.
