Negative. No sign.
Wait a second. I think I got him.
You know...
you could put somebody's
eye out with that thing.
We airlifted out the last passengers,
Ace. We're heading out.
What about the animal cargo?
Don't worry about it. It's just one little
raccoon. If I were you, I'd turn back.
Yeah? Well, if you were me, then I'd be you,
and I'd use your body to get to the top.
You can't stop me,
no matter who you are.
Loser.
Loo-s-e-r.
Hungry, fella?
That ought to hold you for a while.
That's okay, Spike.
There's nothing more we can do.
Look, Spike.
Do not fret, my little woodland friend, for
your life is in the hands of Ace Ventura...
Pet Detective.
Whatever you do...
don't look down.
Hang on! Hang on, little buddy!
I got you. I think I got you.
Maybe not. You're slipping.
Don't let go!
No!
My goodness.
Well, hello. Yes.
Well, now, that was quite a shock.
It's... It's extremely
nice to meet you.
Now, my name is Fulton Greenwall,
and I am looking for an Ace Ventura.
No man here carries with him...
- a label.
- What?
Oh, yes. No names. How silly of me.
Well, he's an American.
We are all children of
the same life force.
Yes, of course we are.
Well... he bends over,
- and he speaks from his rear.
- Oh, him.
Right this way.
He came to us a broken man.
He had lost the will to
sustain his existence.
Yes. I heard about that unfortunate
accident with the raccoon.
It was terrible for him,
but the life force once
again smiled upon him.
He's now at peace.
I will wait here.
- I must apologize.
- Quite. Well, no harm done.
Let me introduce myself.
My name is Fulton Greenwall.
I was sent here to employ your services
in the retrieval of a lost animal.
Now, can you help us?
Your request is not unlike
your lower intestine...
- stinky and loaded with danger.
- We can pay you handsomely.
I am now a child of light.
Your earthly money holds no appeal to me.
Twenty thousand dollars.
Re-eh-eh-eh-eh-eeaaly!
No.
I cannot, for I am sorely needed...
here...
at the Ashram.
If I may interject!
We are short of space,
and it's important for
you to use your talents.
Let me help you pack.
But I am yet to attain omnipresent
supergalactic oneness.
No. Wait.
There it is. You've just attained it.
- I have?
- Yes. Just now.
You are one.
I can see it in your eyes.
You're more one than anyone.
What about my medallion
of spiritual accomplishment?
Take mine.
This took you 80 years to achieve.
That's ok. I don't like
it anymore. Really.
In the light of this personal
sacrifice you've made...
I have no choice...
but to take the case.
Great! I'll go tell the others!
Master...
break it to them gently.
I've never seen them act like that before.
Denial can be an ugly thing.
Well, we should go, Mr. Ventura.
I've arranged a plane.
I'll meet you at the bottom.
There's still one more thing
I must do before I go.
Isn't this incredible?
It's going to be some
kind of a record.
Everyone loves a slinky
You got to get a slinky
Slinky, slinky
Go, slinky, go!
Oh, man!
Can you believe it?
It was right there!
Can I do it one more time?
Please forgive me, sir, but if we don't
hurry now, we might miss the plane.
Of course. How selfish of me.
Let's do all the things
that you want to do.
Canadian moose during mating season.
And now...
a yak.
Peanut?
Yes. I have one right here.
It's bulky, but I consider it carry-on.
Peanut.
Oh, I see.
If we can get back
to business, Mr. Ventura?
The Wachati are a peaceful tribe.
Since their sacred
animal has vanished,
they believe that there is a
curse fallen on their village.
It all started some time ago...
So the daughter of the Wachati chief
is set to wed the first son
of the Wachootoo tribe,
and the sacred animal was offered
as dowry for the marriage.
But if it is not recovered,
the result will be
the merciless slaughter
of the Wachatis.
Uh, Mr. Ventura?
Mr. Ventura!
There's... someone on the wing...
some... thing.
I'm sorry. What were you saying?
The daughter of the Wachati chief
is set to wed the first son
of the Wachootoo tribe.
Spectacular.
This land holds great beauty.
How far to the crime scene?
Well, I've been instructed to
bring you first to the consulate,
which should be beyond those trees
on the other side of the jungle,
so we'll have to circle around...
Oh, no!
Steering's a little loose.
Alignment's off, too.
Mr. Ventura!
<i>Oh, you, pretty Chitty Bang Bang
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang we love you</i>
<i>And our pretty Chitty Bang Bang
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang loves us, too</i>
<i>Hi ho</i>
<i>Everywhere we go,
on Chitty Chitty we depend</i>
<i>Bang bang Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
our fine, four-fendered friend</i>
<i>Bang bang Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
our fine, four-fendered</i>
<i>Chitty Bang Bang Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
Chitty Bang Bang, yeah!</i>
<i>Chitty</i>
- Oh, there's the consulate.
- Oh, thank God.
If I can just find a parking spot.
Perhaps we should slow down
just a teensy-weensy bit.
Nonsense, poopy pants.
We're going a bit fast!
Really! Look out!
Like a glove.
You might want to think about
getting this baby detailed.
Oh, no. The consulate general's car.
Down, Boba. That's it. Down.
Yes. Good.
Come on, man.
Whoa.
Mr. Ventura, so looking
forward to your arrival.
Funny, it didn't seem that painful
when you were doing it to the horse.
Sir, Mr. Ventura has an
affinity for animals.
Shall we?
Shalln't we?
Tell me, Mr. Ventura,
just how good are you?
You're an extreme workaholic.
You recently returned from a short
trip to Gotan in Northern Africa,
and upon your return, you more than likely
took a nasty spill because of some...
shoddy masonry work.
Very impressive. Might one ask how?
Surely.
The abrasion on the
palm of your left hand
is the type one sustains
breaking a fall of 3 to 5 feet.
The small remnants of plaster
on the tip of your shoe
pointed to a careless
Mason being the culprit.
Your new watch, a quality forgery of
a Cartier, was most likely purchased
through the north African black market,
known to reside in Gotan.
- And my work habits?
- Yes. A workaholic.
The urine stain on your pants would
signify that you're a single-shake man,
far too busy for
the follow-up jiggle.
Brilliant, Mr. Ventura.
Simply brilliant.
Spank you, Greenwall.
Spank you very much.
Mr. Ventura, we've been coexisting
quite nicely with the native cultures
for the past 200 years.
They're almost like family at this point.
Are they?
It is imperative that we
recover the sacred animal.
If not, the peaceable Wachatis
will assuredly be obliterated.
The Wachootoos are bloodthirsty.
They consider its disappearance
both an insult and a curse.
Do I have something in my teeth?
Cadby! Lovely brunch, I must say.
Quinn. I'd like you
to meet Ace Ventura.
This is Burton Quinn. He owns and
operates Quinnland Safari Park.
Most call me Quinn.
Say hello, Tinky.
Pleasure, Tinky. <i>Corvus corax</i>.
Common raven. The smartest of all birds.
Rare in these parts.
Excuse me.
That's quite a wrap you're wearing.
Perhaps I could get you
some fluffy new slippers
made from the heads of innocent
and defenseless baby seals.
Who is this ghastly man?
Ace Ventura, Pet Detective. And...
you must be the monopoly guy.
Hey.
Thanks for the free parking.
Another activist, Maguire.
Activist. Yes.
"Activist. Yes."
Mr. Ventura,
there's nothing wrong with
enjoying the fruits of nature.
You should try it sometime.
Alrighty, then.
You know something? You're right.
Do not pass go. Do not collect $200.
It's lovely, but I fancy
myself an autumn.
If you've quite finished,
Mr. Ventura,
we might make for the
projection room, Greenwall.
Kooky.
Mr. Ventura, I'd like you to meet Hitu,
chief of tribal security in the province.
Please!
Don't... get up.
At this point,
we don't have any leads,
but we've had similar
problems in the past.
Sorry.
This is Derrick McCane.
Spotted several times in the
province in the past year,
Mr. McCane makes a handsome living
from rare and endangered species. Hitu.
Now, these two are Australians.
The bald one is Mick Katie.
The other is said to have
been raised by aborigine...
Aborigines. The natives call him...
Call him Gahjii The Hunter.
Both are known poachers and
have been seen in the area!
Mr. Ventura! This wedding ceremony
is going to take place in four days.
I cannot have bloodshed in my province!
We are counting on you!
Hi ho, silver! Away!
I've assigned Greenwall
to assist you.
Before you go, Mr. Ventura,
there's something I'd like to show you,
something you might enjoy.
As one animal lover to another.
Something wrong, Mr. Ventura?
Of course not. This is
a lovely room of death.
Take care, now. Bye-bye, then.
Down, Boba.
Mr. Ventura, how could you?
Now, Mr. Ventura, I think the village
is roughly about a mile ahead.
Excellent. Flat tire.
I think this joke has run
its course, don't you?
Certainly. I prostrate myself before
you and beg your forgiveness.
Don't get me wrong. I mean,
I do enjoy the occasional prank.
It's just that my heel
is getting rather raw.
We love you, dark continent!
Good night!
Listen.
The majestic song of the
male silverback gorilla.
I think we should move along.
It's their mating season,
and they can get rather hostile.
<i>Wee dee dee dee dee dee
dee dee dee dee</i>
<i>Dee, owimoweh</i>
<i>Owimoweh, owimoweh,
Owimoweh, owimoweh</i>
<i>Owimoweh, owimoweh...</i>
Oh. Oh, excuse me, Mr. Ventura.
I have to rest.
- Of course you do!
- Oh.
The Wachatis believe they draw
their power from these caves,
but they now live in fear since
the vanishing of their sacred bat.
Bat?
What? Bat?
The one we're here
to find, Mr. Ventura.
You didn't say anything about a bat.
- What's the difference?
- What's the difference?
Have you ever seen a bat?
They're hideous.
Lifeless beady eyes, clawed feet,
huge, grotesque wings, even fangs.
They give you rabies, you know.
Yes. Quite. I see your point. But are you
saying that you won't take the case?
No. As a being of light,
I must show compassion
- for all the living things of nature.
- Good.
I'm not touching it, though.
No, spank you.
The Wachati are a peaceful people.
They find all forms of life sacred.
I like them already.
<i>Bumbawae atuna.
Bumbawae atuna.</i>
Hi there. Nice to see you.
Bumblebee tuna. Bumblebee tuna.
Ace Ventura, Pet Detective.
How are you this afternoon?
Alrighty, then.
Excuse me. Your balls are showing.
Bumblebee tuna.
They have lived in the same
state for thousands of years.
They did not know about disease
until the white man came.
What's going on over here?
Oh, yes. Now, all young
Wachati warriors
must face five days of
balance and concentration.
Should he lose his focus and fall,
he must start all over again.
Earthquake test.
He's good. With my help,
he could be the best.
Maybe we should see the chief,
Mr. Ventura. This way.
Neat-o!
The chief says he
knew you would come.
Libby libby wa!
Chim chiminy chim chim cher-oo! Hey!
The chief says he has not
understood the dialect you're using.
Tell him I'm happy to meet
him and that his sacred...
bat is as good as found.
Oh, my goodness. The chief
really seems to like you. I mean,
that is a great sign of
affection in the Wachati tribe.
Re-eh-eh-eh-eh-eeaaly!
Oh, this is the chief's son, Ouda.
The missionaries came through
and taught him a spot of English.
I like you.
My...
Aren't I the popular one?
Allow me to display my affection.
It is the mucus that binds us.
<i>A bubo obe.</i>
The chief says that the
sacred hut is over there.
How did they get past the guard?
Well, I'm afraid he was found
shortly after... sleeping.
At ease, soldier.
We all make mistakes.
Quite an auspicious dwelling
for a filthy flying weasel.
<i>Alla Shikaka!</i>
Please, Mr. Ventura.
That is sacred ground.
I'm sorry, but only the Wachati
are allowed to step there.
Hey... Take it easy.
I'm the loogie guy, remember?
Y-yes, yes, chief. Thank you.
<i>Dalu.</i> Thank you.
The chief says unless the sacred bat is
returned before the marriage of the princess,
the entire Wachati tribe
will meet their death.
What type of bat are
we talking about here?
The great white bat, of course.
<i>- Corpus kilochiroptera?</i>
- Yes, but to the natives...
<i>Shikaka.</i>
<i>Shikaka?</i>
<i>Shikaka!</i>
Shikasha!
Shh... Shish kebab.
Shh... Shawshank redemption. Chicago!
You're... out of there!
Go on. You're gone. Go on!
Were you going to eat these?
Ace.
I've got to inspect that cage.
My, my, my.
This fruit paste is delicious.
- And the pottery is lovely.
- It's made from guano.
Guano? That sounds so familiar.
Bat droppings.
Guano is the chief
resource of the Wachati.
They use it to make many
things in the village.
Yummy.
Oh. Now, this is really fascinating.
This is a great Wachati tradition...
the virgin's dance of seduction.
I am now a holy man. I think of women
only as the mothers of our children.
They are a sanctuary for
the reproductive organs,
a temple to house the
miracle of procreation.
Do you have a dollar?
Oh! Thank you so much.
I've not danced in years.
Hi.
Don't mind me. Sleep.
Sleep.
Sleep.
Fee... fi...
fo... fum!
I smell... the fingerprints of scum!
Better dust the place.
Totally clean.
Not one damn clue.
Unless...
Here she comes. Oh, boy.
Holy, holy, holy, holy.
Good thoughts in, bad thoughts out.
Good, bad, good, bad, good, good...
You have come to help us.
We are in great appreciation.
You...
speak English.
Yes.
The missionaries...
they come with books.
You are very good with that.
It's incredibly accurate.
Care to try?
Not bad.
Try again. Relax your shoulders...
breathe... and release.
There you go.
You make me smile.
And yet...
I am troubled.
You see...
the man my father
wants me to marry...
I am worried I will not please him.
I...
I have never known a man.
I would love to help, but you see,
I have vowed to take
a life of celibacy.
Well, perhaps this...
will assist your decision.
Those are very nice, but I'm
a child of light... a pure spirit.
I am no longer encumbered
by the appetites of the flesh.
Oh, mama. Oh, mama.
Oh, mama. Oh, mama.
Oh, mama. Ooh, mama. Ooh, mama.
I'm so sorry, Mr. Ventura...
I...
That's ok.
I was just...
practicing my mantra.
Oh, yes.
I thought you wanted to
visit the sacred caves.
I do. Could you meet me
outside in ten minutes?
If I don't finish my meditation...
I tend to get a little cranky.
- Take care, now. Bye-bye, then.
- Bye. Bye.
Well, everything here seems good!
Big load off my mind. Oh, God,
you can speculate all you want, you know,
but unless you check it out for yourself,
you never know.
We should head back now.
Don't you think you
should investigate?
There's no reason to go in there... ever.
I sense it as a holy man.
- But I thought you said...
- It's dark!
I could fall into a precipice.
Here. Take this.
Spank you, Helpy Helperton.
I am not afraid.
I am not afraid.
I really like it here.
My medallion.
I will fear no living creature as
long as I keep this near me.
Take that, you winged spawn of Satan!
That's ok.
All I really need is my torch.
Die, devil bird!
I'm ok.
Get away!
They're in my hair!
They're in my hair!
Oh, God in heaven, help me!
Ace, there is nothing in your hair.
Exactly. I was merely
running a drill.
Just as I suspected.
- Quinn.
- What?
We met him at Cadby's soiree.
His bird is a raven named Tinky.
I found that inside the cave.
Ace, now, you don't understand.
Burton Quinn is a very powerful man.
Worry not, my brother...
For I...
am a master...
of disguises.
<i>There's a man who leads
a life of danger</i>
<i>To everyone he meets,
he stays a stranger</i>
<i>Oh, with every move he makes,
another chance he takes</i>
<i>Odds are he won't live
to see tomorrow</i>
<i>Secret agent man, secret agent man</i>
<i>They've given you a number
and taken away your name</i>
Eat up, guys. None of
this animal goes to waste.
<i>Be careful what you say</i>
<i>Or you'll give yourself away</i>
<i>Odds are you won't
live to see tomorrow</i>
<i>Secret agent man, secret agent man</i>
<i>They've given you a number
and taken away your name</i>
Mr. McCane.
How are you doing?
I'm... I'm... I'm doing well,
thank you.
Don't mind me, Mr. Quinn.
I'm just a curious little rhino.
I appreciate your...
agreeing to undertake this.
Meeting secretly with
sinister types much?
Ah, not too much. Ah, much too much.
I'll pay your fee...
the sum we've agreed upon.
Kind of hot in these rhinos.
Warm!
I had a dog, and his
name was... Bingo!
Oh, time to get some oxygen.
Oh, no.
Come on!
Mayday!
Must... have... air!
Come on, girls.
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet.
Look. Take a look.
Oh, look. The mother
rhino is giving birth.
Oh, God.
Mommy!
Cool!
- Go, Annie! Get out of here!
- Get in the jeep! Quick, girls! Get in!
Welcome to Quinnland.
And you, too, my friend.
Yes. Yes. I know
you'll be happy here.
Well, how did you
get out, little fella?
You're a cute little devil,
aren't you?
What's that you got there?
Where's the bat?
What is this about? Who are you?
Where is the bat?
I know who you are.
I met you at Cadby's!
You're that... Ventura fella!
Last chance!
Where is that darn bat?
What are you going to do?
What are you going to do?
Whatever I have to
to get some answers.
Stop that! Stop it! Stop that!
You'd like me to stop that,
wouldn't you? Getting to you?
I'll never tell you anything.
Ooh...
A tough guy?
I know what to do with tough guys.
Wheee!
No!
My brother used to do that to me!
Oh, you sadistic bastard!
Stop it! Stop it!
- All right, I'll talk!
- Spill it!
I paid Derrick McCane
to find the bat.
I thought it could be an attraction.
Business has been a bit off lately.
So...
you don't know who...
- took the bat?
- Neither does McCane!
Ok.
I'm going to untie you now...
But before I do, I want you to
know that I'm really, truly, very...
Sorry!
Appreciate the lift!
We'll walk from here.
<i>Shikaka!</i>
Ok, Quinn is out of the picture.
We have no more suspects or clues,
but I have instincts, Spike, and my
instincts tell me we're getting closer.
I can feel it. I can
feel it like it's right...
in my neck! Run!
Starting to get numb!
Three darts is too much.
I think I lost them.
Hey!
Flowers... for me?
I do declare, Mr. Beauregard.
You are my hero.
Was I...
- talking in my sleep?
- You've been suffering hysteria.
It's a natural reaction to
the poison in these darts.
Water.
Guano bowls.
Collect the whole set.
Ace, did you see the shooter?
Only their feet.
Not enough for a positive I.D.
That is the dart of the
Wachootoo shaman.
- The Whaty Whatan?
- The Wachootoo shaman, or medicine man,
has openly protested against
the intertribal wedding.
Has he?
- But you do not speak Wachootoo.
- I go with you.
Yes. Ouda will be my interpreter.
Ace!
Now, please take care.
The Wachootoo are a savage tribe.
If they catch you,
they'll show no mercy.
Worry not, my brother.
I will be as a fly on the wall,
a grain of salt in the ocean.
I will slip amongst them
like a transparent...
thing.
The sacred bat has got to
be in one of those huts,
but we'll never know until I
can walk freely among them.
<i>"Wunderbar!"</i> He exclaimed
with great relish.
Come on, girls! Show them
what you got! Oh! Big finish!
I'm sure it's fine. Ouda is
probably going for help right now.
Hello, Ace!
They found me. No sweat!
Don't beat yourself up.
You know,
gingivitis is the number-one
cause of all tooth decay.
<i>Equinsu ocha!</i>
- What does <i>equinsu ocha</i> mean?
- White devil.
- Well, tell them I'm not.
- I've only met you. How do I know?
<i>Equinsu ocha! Equinsu ocha!</i>
- He said...
- Let me guess. "White devil, white devil"?
Yes. You speak Wachootoo?
Tell them what I'm saying.
I come in peace!
<i>Equinsu ocha uza inkosazana.</i>
I couldn't help but notice
that <i>equinsu ocha</i> part.
- Did you just refer to me as white devil?
- This how they know you.
Leave that part out from now on.
I represent the princess!
War... is hell.
The last thing we want...
is a fight.
The chief said, if you pass all
Wachootoo tests, you do not die.
Kooky.
<i>Ooh, abba wah, ay bay abba wah</i>
<i>Abba wah, ay bay abba wah</i>
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh
Bay abba wah</i>
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh
Bay abba wah</i>
Yeah!
<i>You can make me out to be a fool</i>
<i>Even say I lost my mind</i>
<i>I know in my heart there's no room</i>
<i>You're the one I need to find</i>
<i>Sometimes at night, I feel alone</i>
<i>And I know I need someone</i>
<i>To hold my hand and carry me home</i>
<i>My ancestor, I'm lost in the storm</i>
<i>Abba
I'm what you need</i>
<i>Abba
I lean on you</i>
<i>Abba
I have my faith in you</i>
<i>Abba
Let me call your name</i>
<i>Abba
I'm what you need</i>
<i>Abba
Let me see your face</i>
<i>Abba
Take me to your place</i>
<i>Abba</i>
<i>Ooh, ooh, ooh
Bay abba wah</i>
<i>Bay abba wah</i>
My entrance to the winner's circle.
Your admiration is well-founded,
but I'm merely a servant.
Do not worship me!
Chief says you have
passed all tests but one.
Only left is Wachootoo
circle of death.
Funny... that's my specialty.
This is it? I have to beat him?
Alrighty, then.
I must tell you...
I do not wish to fight you.
Violence is no longer in my nature,
but if you want it, you got it, sister!
Biting, I see.
I was unaware that the Wachootoos...
were biters!
Well, why don't you try
this on and see how it fits?
Ace...
He much better fighter than you.
Doii!
<i>Equinsu ocha!</i>
All right! This white devil
thing has gone far enough.
Nobody messes with the "do"!
<i>Equinsu ocha...</i>
He said sorry, white devil,
but he must kill you now.
I'll have you know I have the reflexes
of a cat and the speed of a mongoose.
Throw it. I dare you!
Ouda, don't just stand there.
Throw me a spear!
It's in the bone. It's in the bone.
It's in the bone.
Chief says you make him laugh.
You are like sissy girl.
Sissy girl.
Wachootoo chief say
you friend to Wachootoo.
But if curse of <i>shikaka</i> not lifted
by tomorrow's sun at top of sky,
Wachootoo kill all Wachati and
smash your head on a rock.
Super. Take care, now. Bye-bye, then.
Ok. Take care. Super. Bye-bye, then.
Are your legs sore?
Do you want me to carry you?
That won't be necessary, my friend.
I have an incredibly high threshold
for pain. Holy monkey!
Ace, why you stopped?
The Wachootoo didn't take <i>shikaka.</i>
Hi. Welcome back.
- What would you say this is?
- Dart of Wachootoo shaman.
Precisely. And when compared to
one of the darts that hit me before?
Same.
Only to the untrained eye.
You see, the Wachootoo dart is
made of wood from a mimosa tree,
while the other dart is carved
from a red fungus-bearing acalla.
And there's only one area of the jungle
with red fungus-bearing acallas.
Go back to the village. Tell them the
Wachootoos attack tomorrow at noon.
Ok.
This little hound dog
just picked up a scent.
Won't be long now, Katie.
Big night tonight. You're going
to meet your new owner.
G'day. Disgusting rat.
Gravy.
Did you hear that?
- What is it?
- Silverback.
Female.
- Big.
- Yeah?
About 200 meters...
south.
- We'd get $5,000 for one of those.
- What about the rat?
Don't worry about the rat.
We'll be back in no time.
Stay downwind.
You're even uglier than I thought.
She's a big one, isn't she?
Oh, boy. Deciduous trees
lining the riverbank.
Suman shrubs with extreme protococcus.
Steadily increasing water current.
Spike, I think we can assume the
stream gets pretty rough up ahead.
As soon as I get you loose, Spike,
you can chew through my ropes.
That's it! That's it!
Yes! Your turn.
All right! Yes!
Hey! Spike! Spike!
Spike!
Spi...
ike!
I'm alive.
I'm alive!
Yee-haw! Yee-haw!
Say "Uncle"! Say "Uncle"!
Oh, no.
Don't start what you can't finish!
Quit hitting yourself. Quit hitting
yourself. Quit hitting yourself.
Oh, water tastes good, yes.
Glub, glub!
This isn't over yet.
There's something I've missed,
some clue I've overlooked,
some motive, and that motive is...
Pluh! Think!
Somebody wants these two
tribes to destroy each other.
There must be something
valuable in this equation.
Perhaps we should
meditate upon it, Spike,
for it is said that when
seeking answers, one must...
quiet the soul in order to hear them.
What is it the Wachatis possess
that is of great value to other men...
besides the princess
with the amazing rack.
<i>Alrighty, then</i>
<i>Alrighty, then</i>
Oh, Ace. You're back?
You can dispense with
the smallpox, all-knowing one.
I'm here on business,
and time is of the essence.
Very well. What answer do you seek?
I need to know what it
is the Wachatis possess
that is of great value
to civilized man.
The medallion will lead
you to the answer.
You do still have
the medallion, don't you?
Medallion? Why... surely.
I left it back... with my body.
Your aura is weakening.
Ok, I threw it in the cave!
What do you want from me?
What are you, Mr. Perfect?
You want to know where it is?
It's probably lying...
in a big pile of...
Guano!
They have guano!
Like...
a glove.
Hi, chief.
Appreciate your meeting me here.
Let's go kick some...
consulate butt.
Hello, Ace.
- You've come for your money?
- Wrong again, Sweeney Toad.
I've come for the sacred bat.
Where is it?
Why, Ace, whatever can you mean?
Guano. Hello.
Does "poo" ring a bell?
"Guano mines as a source of nitrate,
producing 84% of the world's supply
of fertilizer, a $1.4 billion industry."
That's what this war is all about.
You can't legally take
possession of the caves
as long as the Wachatis
inhabit the area,
and you want that dookie
so bad, you can taste it.
- But, sir, I thought that...
- Yes. Thank you, Fulton.
That's a fine theory, Mr. Ventura.
What has it got to do with me?
I thought you'd never ask.
The day I met you, there was a white substance
on your shoe that I mistook for plaster.
Yesterday, I saw the same white substance
outside the hut where the bat was kept,
and suddenly it hit me. The great
white bat has great white guano.
That's what you slipped in!
That's what was on your shoe!
And that explains the
abrasion on your palm!
Let me run that back for you.
That's what you slipped in!
That's what was on your shoe!
And that explains the
abrasion on your palm!
Damn, I'm good! Can you feel that?
Can you feel it, captain compost?
The day of redemption is at hand!
Repent!
And thou shall be saved.
Very good, Mr. Ventura.
Very good. I believe
you've solved the case.
One thing I still don't understand,
Mr. Belvedere.
If you are the slime
behind this little flimflam,
why, oh, why did you hire me?
I'm afraid there's going to be a
horrendous investigation after the war.
You were my alibi to prove I'd
done everything I could to stop it.
Arrest him. Arrest him!
Please, arrest him.
Simon says, "arrest him."
I thought you loved
all animals, Mr. Ventura.
"I thought you loved all animals,
Mr. Ventura."
Shall I stick him on the wall?
No. I don't think it'll
be necessary, Gahjii.
Mr. Ventura here has very cleverly
stolen the sacred bat of the Wachati.
Unfortunately, we were unable to
recover it in time to stop the war.
Greenwall, hit the lights!
The switch on the wall
beside you... go for it!
Flick it, quick!
Alrighty, then. Shall we go to jail?
Hey, what are you,
H.R. Shove-n-stuff?
Get in!
Just one more thing...
What are you doing?
Stop it! I said stop it!
To the jungle, Boba.
Friends, rodents,
quadrupeds,
lend me "your ears"!
Imbecile! You let him get away.
Sir, you don't seem to understand.
The entire tribe will be killed.
- Remind me to send a sympathy card.
- We'll go and get the bastard.
Doesn't matter, Gahjii.
There's nothing he can do now.
We've got the bat,
and it's nearly noon.
What the hell is going on?
You see...
humans and animals
can live in harmony.
Wow.
Sorry for the delay, Ace.
Hey, poachers!
Say hello to my stinky little friend.
Get off, get off, get off.
Not so fast, Sally.
Get it away!
<i>Shikaka!</i>
Aw, he wants to go off-road.
Nobody wants to play with me.
Loser!
Cadby! From the consulate, right?
This is weird.
Bleah.
Noon.
The Wachati.
The spirit will overcome.
The spirit will overcome.
<i>Shikaka!</i>
Headhunters!
Wachootoo!
<i>Shikaka!</i>
Pet Detective coming through.
Clear a path, people!
<i>Shikaka!</i>
<i>Equinsu ocha! Equinsu ocha!</i>
Yuck!
<i>Wee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee</i>
<i>Dee, owimoweh</i>
<i>Owimoweh, owimoweh,
owimoweh, owimoweh</i>
<i>Owimoweh, owimoweh,
owimoweh, owimoweh...</i>
They will now consummate the marriage
under the witness of the tribe.
Well done, Ace.
You must be extremely proud.
Pride is an abomination.
One must forgo the self
to attain total spiritual creaminess
and avoid the chewy chunks
of degradation.
What's that he's saying?
Well, I think he's saying
she's not a virgin.
They can tell that?
<i>Shikaka!</i>
<i>Shikaka!</i>
<i>There is no political solution</i>
<i>To our troubled evolution</i>
<i>I have no faith in constitution</i>
<i>No, no</i>

<i>Get down</i>
<i>Let me tell you about
a friend of mine</i>
<i>His name's Boll Weevil,
check him out</i>
<i>He spends all day on his big butt</i>
<i>And he don't ever, ever get outside</i>
<i>I come to visit
I bring some sunshine</i>
<i>And I just spread it
all over the fire</i>
<i>He's stuck on his big couch
Stuck in his big shell</i>
<i>He looks at the TV,
and he's all right</i>
<i>I come from the drug lord,
the local drugstore</i>
<i>Bug is a fly, baby,
he's never uptight</i>
<i>And I wonder</i>
<i>Boll Weevil, why don't you
get out of your home?</i>
<i>He said, "I'm comfortable here"</i>
<i>"I don't want to move,
I don't want to leave"</i>
<i>I said, "Boll Weevil,
get right out of your home"</i>
<i>"Good-bye, I got to stay,
I'll move some other day"</i>
<i>"Bye-bye, I got to go to sleep"
And let the tube shine</i>
<i>Let the tube shine</i>
<i>Let the tube shine</i>
<i>Let the tube shine</i>
<i>Now, I would tell you
about Boll Weevil</i>
<i>But that bug is just too scary
He's sitting there all alone</i>
<i>I try to coax him out
with chocolate pie</i>
<i>But he would not move a muscle
And I tried</i>
<i>To make him see that the
sun is shining outside</i>
<i>To make him see that the
sun is shining outside</i>
<i>To make him see that the
sun is shining outside</i>
<i>To make him see that the
sun is shining outside</i>
<i>To make him see that the
sun is shining outside</i>
<i>Check it out</i>
<i>Boll Weevil, get right
out of your home</i>
<i>Boll Weevil, get right
out of your home</i>
<i>Boll Weevil, get right
out of your home</i>
<i>Boll Weevil, get right
out of your home</i>
<i>Now, I would tell you

<i>But that bug is just too scary
He's sitting there all alone</i>
<i>I try to coax him out
with chocolate pie</i>
<i>But he would not move a muscle
And I tried</i>
<i>To make him see that the
sun is shining outside</i>
<i>To make him see that

<i>Make him see the sun

<i>Make him see the sun,
make him see the sun</i>
<i>Make him see the goddamn sun</i>
Come on, little buggy.
There's a little bug.
