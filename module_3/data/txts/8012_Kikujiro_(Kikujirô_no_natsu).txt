GRANDMA'S FRIENDS
Masao, got summer plans?
And you, Yuji?
Going to Dad's hometown
near the sea.
Lucky you.
The other way?
You kids shouldn't smoke.
Slackers.
What about Classes?
Better get serious,
Or you'll end up like him.
Hey, Masao!
Why so early today?
School's out?
Vacation starts tomorrow.
Your grandma fine?
What a gloomy kid!
We used to be neighbors.
Lives with his grandma.
And the parents?
Don't think he has a father.
And the mother?
Think she's working elsewhere.
Ran off with some man, huh?
You talking about your mom?
Hell, yours married 3 times!
Lay off my mother!
Same goes for mine, damn it!
Masao...
What are you doing here?
There's no practice in summer.
Little mule.
It's summer vacation.
Go to the beach. Have some fun!
What are you saying?
You know your father died
in an accident.
Then what about mom?
You know she's far away.
Working hard just for you.
So you must study hard.
When you grow up,
you can go anywhere you want.
Hurry, eat your breakfast.
I'm off to work. Be a good boy.
Yuji, let's play.
See you.
Delivery service!
- Got a rubber stamp?
- Stamp?
If not, you can just sign.
Please sign here.
That's fine.
Thank you.
This all you got?
Going somewhere?
What the hell is going on here!
Did you take his money?
Tell me why!
He didn't pay up yesterday.
Give it back to him.
Right now!
It's his, remember?
Hand over more money
Or I'll kill you guys!
Quit playing gangster!
What's that racket?
What you guys doing?
Tap dancing.
Tap? What's that?
Haven't you heard Of
Gene Kelly? Fred Astaire?
I'm supposed to know them?
Visit your mother?
Toyohashi is so far away.
You can't go alone.
You don't have much money.
Does your grandma know?
Didn't think so.
She'll be worried.
Someone must go with you.
No fooling around, you hear?
Take him straight there.
Give me another 10,000 yen.
50,000 is enough!
Move it!
What's wrong?
Don't worry. I'll call grandma.
Hurry and go. Don't lose him.
Hello.
So hot, isn't it?
I just ran into Masao.
Said he wasn't going
anywhere this summer.
My hubby took him to the beach.
Hope you don't mind.
Sure he won't be a bother?
oh, my husband loves kids.
Thank you. Have some.
Damn it to hell.
I lost again.
Get lost! You no-good loser.
You're bad luck.
Beat it, you clown.

3 and 5.
That was close!
Number 3 made it.
We almost won.
Your touch coming back?
What's next?

No problem.
Crappy odds anyway.
It's nothing.
Now for the real thing.
Speak to me.
7 and 9.
Now you're talking. 7 and 9.
You idiot!
Why didn't you say 9 - 7
instead of 7 - 9?
Don't mess with me, kid!
Damn, I could've won 838,000!
I would've bought you
an Armani suit.
What's wrong with you?
Next race. Numbers.
4 and 5.
4 and 5, meaning 4 Comes first?
4 - 5.
- Sure 5 isn't first?
- No.
4 - 5 is the right order?
You're in trouble if the reverse wins.
4 - 5? Better buy the reverse, too.
Stupid! You weren't even close!
Haven't I been good to you?
And you're good for nothing!
I'm running out of money!
- Think hard!

The floor?
You're a whiz kid after all.
This is yesterday's, you moron.
Hand over the 10,000.
SCARY MAN
Hey, this is tough as hell.
Is it dog or cat meat?
That would cost you more.
Smart-ass.
Where's the kid?
He was just here!
He left with some man.
What kind?
Middle-aged. Bald. Suit.
Where'd they go?
That park.
Sonny, you want to

I might as well drive.
What's with the smoke?

Must be the wrong gear.
Weird!
What in the hell?
This can't be safe.
Hey. wake up.
Time to go, kid.
When we get there,
you got to introduce me.
Show Mom the nice man
who spent so much money on you.

Without a reservation...

Won't you swim, Mister?
Don't you know how?
What do you think?

Are you okay?
I'm fine.
That man.
He's not your father?
Then why?
He's taking me to my mother.
Studying again, kid?
I don't understand this.
Well, let's see...
oh, my God. I'm beat.
I need a massage.
Come on, kid. Give it a shot.
That's it.
Not the head, dummy!
Sorry, off-limits.
It's prohibited.
Sorry, no fishing.
It's prohibited.
That's too much! It's robbery!
It's high season. You also bought
glasses and swimsuits.
It's still too much!
Your taxi's waiting, sir.
Send it away! I'm broke!
You'll have to give us a lift.
I can't leave here.
It's you who took all my money!
You're giving us a ride,joker.
Let's go.
Where's that brat?
Kid, we're out of here.
Come on.
We're waiting. Be there!
IT DIDN'T WORK OUT
Would you get out?
No way.
We're here.
Shut up.
You'll find a ride here.
Where are we?
Many cars stop here.
just ask for a lift.
No-good bastard!
Come stay with us again.
- Buy something nice.
- Thank you, sir.
That's my money, damn it!
Rotten Crook!
okay, you go ask.
Try those trucks.
Sir,
Could you please
take me to Toyohashi?
Sorry, not on my route.
What's the matter?
Sir, Could you please
take me to Toyohashi?
Toyohashi?
I need to sleep.
Sorry.
It didn't work out.
Hey, you!
Take me to Toyohashi!
Who the hell are you?
A hitchhiker, damn it!
I'm on duty, loud mouth!
The way you talk!
Who'd give you a ride?
Your face just isn't right.
You got to look sadder.
That's better. Now, look sad.
There's someone now!
Please give me a lift to Toyohashi.
Not going that way.
And we're on a date.
Give him a ride.
Poor little boy!
- No way.
- Give him a ride.
Come on. Get in.
Much obliged, ma'am.
Please spare me a moment.
Cutie, come here.
Put the coin in the doll.
Time's up. Another one.
Time's up. Here you go.
It broke down.
These are angel's wings.
Fly like a bird.
Go on. Fly.
KEEP OFF THE GRASS
Be good, Cutie. See you.
No cars pass here, damn it.
- We're off...
- Rat!
This isn't so hard.
That stuck-up chick!
Boy, it's hot.
Don't sit here, you sweaty pig!
I have my rights.
- Bus passes here?
- Now and then.
You must be a farmer.
No, no. A banker.
You're kidding.
With a face like that?
But I really work at a
musical instrument factory.
Instruments?
- You make gongs?
- No, no. Pianos.
With that face? No way.
I don't make them.
I'm a security guard.
Really?
You take cuts from thieves?
Me, never!
I need to take a leak.
So noisy.
You even farted!
- Was it loud?
- Damn loud.
- No one's come by!
- Won't be long.
- Stop panting.
- I'm hot.
oh, there he is.
See you.
That's no bus, you old fool!
Dumb hick!
Here, kid. Eat this.
Where'd that come from?
Hotel made it.
Eat up.
What about you?
Well, I'm hungry, but...
You eat. I'll be okay.
Grown-ups
have to make
sacrifices for little children.
I have to pee.
Mister, it's not working out.
Then take a seat and rest.
Hell of a bus stop.
Must be 30 years old!
Tap dancing is easy.
I've got a plan.
oh, here comes a car.
It's all yours. Make it good!
A car? Is a car coming?
A car. Where's the car?
A car! Kid, ask for a lift.
Please, sir, would you be so kind
and take this blind man to Toyohashi?
I'm on duty now.
And this is a new car. Still not
used to it. I'm sorry, I can't.
New car? This piece of junk!
Stupid decoration!
You're not blind at all.
Nut case!
You just can't pull it off.
I better do it alone, okay.
Mister, a car's coming.
Who's this?
My mother.
Looks really sweet.
I don't know.
You've never met her?
So he's just like me.
Got it? We both help out
with the flat tire.
That'll get us a ride.
Put it over there.
Wrong spot!
Bit closer. About 20cm.
Run for it!
Asking politely is easier.
Shut up, smart aleck.
That jerk! Dumping us out here!
Where the hell are we now?
Shouldn't be hard.
It's parked. Piece of cake!
Go find a nail. A big one.
That won't work.
Needs to be pulled off.
I'll take you anywhere. I'm easy.
Don't you work?
Oh, I travel all around.
I write poetry and songs.
I plan to write a novel.
The house is just down this way.
Let's not get excited.
Oh, got to pee. Wait there.
I was thinking.
Once you meet your mom,
you'll stay the night, right?
What about me?
You can stay, too.
Me?
Not a good idea.
Your mom's pretty.
I might get friendly with her.
Could end up marrying her.
Then I'd beyour dad.
How would that be?
You'd have to call me Daddy.
Try it. Call me, '' Daddy.''
Say it, you little shit!
Let's go.
Too much!
ANGEL BELL
That's the place, but...
What's your mom's name?
Satoko Sugiyama.
YOSHI MURA FAMILY
Come on. Must be the wrong lady.
The address is right, but...
Not the right lady.
Let's go.
Your mom must have moved.
I'll go ask that lady.
just wait here.
What's that blue thing?
That? It's an angel bell.
- What's that?
- Good luck charm.
Hand it over.
I can't.
And why not?
A gift from a girl.
A girl friend?
Is it the skinhead?
He's not my girl!
- I want it!
- No way.
- I'll steal the bike.
- That wouldn't be nice.
Your choice!
It's just like I said,
your mom moved away.
In case you'd come looking,
she left this bell for you.
It's an angel bell.
If ever you're sad or in trouble,
just ring this bell.
An angel will come to help.
Go on. Ring it.
An angel might bring your mom.
See an angel?
I don't see anything.
Then you got to ring louder.
An angel will come.
I don't think so.
MISTER PLAYED WITH ME
Time to head home?
Come on.
MISTER FELL DOWN THE STAIRS
But that was a hit!
What the...?
Get in closer.
What in the hell?
These corks are useless.
We need rocks.
Okay, shoot.
It's just no use!
Okay. Try it again.
This time, shout, '' Bang.''
Say, '' Bang.''
Got it!
Never fell before.
Well, it just did, so we want it.
If you had shot it down,
it would be yours.
But it's not made to fall.
Then it's a rip-off.
Rip-off?
That's what these fairs are about.
So buy it back.
How much?
20,000 yen.
That's too much.
It's only worth 2,000.
2,000 wholesale?
So make it 3,000.
Fork it over!
- Okay, I'll pay.
- Damn right, you will!
- It's busted.
- That's life.
You're just not doing it right.
You have to scoop them up.
Hold on, man!
What?
You can't do it that way.
I paid, you jerk!
I'll do what I want.
Let's move on.
What did you pray for?
Tell me, kid.
Can't tell.
We need to talk, wise guy.
What about?
Seems you make trouble.
What's it to you?
Damned smart-ass.
Let's take a walk.
Kid, wait here a moment.
Touch so much as a hair...
I'll crush you and your family.
Try it, big mouth.
I've got a child.
Lay off, you guys.
Hiding behind a kid.
You pathetic scum.
What's up, little man?
I'm waiting for someone.
Shouldn't be here all alone.
Demons will come...
and get you!
Kid.
Sorry. I fell down some stairs.
MARUYA PHARMACY
Mister.
Thanks, kid.
I'm so sorry.
Hi again.
BIG SALE
1 EAR - 200 YEN, 2 EARS - 500 YEN
Really? ...
Must have been tough on the boy.
That stuff happens
all the time in books.
Let's camp out here
for a couple of days.
OCTOPUS MAN
Fatso and Baldy ride again.
Why not?
Well, no talk about the bell
to the kid.
No fish there, you know.
No fish?
Not in that place.
Then, damn it, you goons,
you'll be the fish.
Got a bite. Must be a big one.
I'm not a good fish.
Didn't show.
Okay. Octopus on standby.
Fatso.
You know Daito-cho?
Yes, it's not far from here.
How do you know?
I'm from around here.
Kid, I'm taking a spin.
Have some fun with him.
Let's go.
Take me to Daito-cho.
Make it fast.
Let's play a game.
Hide the stone.
I guess the cup.
Go ahead.
Ready.
That one.
Bingo.
Again.
Ready.
Which one? That one?
Wrong.
So, which one? Which one?
This one!
Stone changed to candy!
This way, please.
Good afternoon.
Shall I get her?
No, never mind.
Your mother there?
Yeah.
How was she?
None of your business. Get lost!
What about you?
It's a long way back.
Mind your own business. Beat it!
Bow and arrow's ready.
Aim like this. Got it?
This is the target. Aim at this can.
Hold it here. Like this. Then pull.
You could have waited!
Shame on you!
Come and play.
For the boy's sake.
All right, damn it.
Here we go. Drums, start.
Indian, enter.
Baldy, who gave you your cue?
Okay. I'll say a UFO landed.
I bring the kid over.
You enter,
say you're an alien.
Kid'll love it. Try it.
Masao, I am an alien
from outer space.
Tell me,
why would an alien know his name?
just say, ''I'm an alien.'' Okay?
Rehearse it.
Today, you're an alien.
Tomorrow, you're a demon.
For the kid's sake. Let's go.
The Big Dipper.
You know how it came to be?
Once upon a time, long ago,
there was a great drought.
In a village, there lived
a little girl.
One day, this girl went out
in search of water.
She needed water for her mother,
sick with high fever.
But no water was to be found.
Exhausted, the little girl
fainted on the roadside.
She woke to find her wooden dipper
filled with water.
Over joyed, the girl began
her journey home.
She crossed a puppy,
dying of thirst.
This made her sad.
So she gave half the water
to the poor puppy.
Her dipper turned into silver
and began to shine.
It became a beautiful,
sparkling dipper.
I am an alien from outer space.
Yup, an alien
from a galaxy far away.
Yes, sir. I said I'm
an alien from outer space.
An alien waiting on supper!
Come on, you Earthlings.
I'm an alien from outer space!
Morning, chief.
Where did that come from?
From that field.
Stolen?
The fruit of hard working farmers!
How dare you!
You'll never be big shots.
Better when it's cold, you morons.
I should chill you guys.
Too many seeds, damn it.
Okay. Turn around.
Once more.
That's good.
Go straight.
Little to the right.
Now, straight.
That's it.
Stop. Stop.
Two steps right.
Yes, there.
Watermelon 2, ready?
One-two-three. Freeze!
Oh-oh, Mr. Heavyweight.
Who?
You're the only heavy one
around here, Fatso.
Problem, Fatso?
One-two-three. Freeze!
Oh-oh, Mr. Nice Guy.
Oh, did I move?
You're Mr. Baldy, idiot!
Next game: Naked Statues.
What's that?
- Don't know that game?
- No, sir.
First, get your clothes off.
Then put your clothes back on,
without getting caught moving.
Get ready.
What's wrong? Get moving!
Here we go!
One-two-three. Freeze!
Hell, Baldy. You didn't have to
take everything off!.
jackass!
Let's get out of here!
GOOD-BYE
What are you doing?
We're off to Tokyo tomorrow.
Look.
Over there. The Big Dipper.
Fatso. Baldy. So long.
- Good-bye, kid.
- Be good.
Where are you?
Over here!
Gotcha!
What's your plan?
Osaka, then south to Kyushu.
Be good, kid.
We have to part here, too.
Let's do it again sometime.
Take care.
Thanks, Mister.
Take good care of your grandma.
Mister.
What's your name anyway?
Kikujiro!
Now, scram!
