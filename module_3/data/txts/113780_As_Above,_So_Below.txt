     I've just crossed the
     Iranian border en route
     to the Habala region
      where they've
      ordered the destruction
         of a network of caves
         by sundown tonight.
      I believe that these
      caves might contain
         a critical missing
         piece of our history.
          If I'm found dead,
          please know that I
          entered this country
          of my own free will,
     fully knowing
     that the punishment
     for trespassing here
      is burial up to
      your neck in sand
     and having a rock wall
     pushed on top of you.
     But they would have
     to catch me first.
        (INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
             (KNOCKING ON DOOR)
         Hurry. Come.
          Scarlett.
        SCARLETT: Reza.
        Thank you.
      If they catch you,
      it would be very
      bad for you.
      Yes, I know, Reza.
      We will be quick.
             Okay.
         Here it is.
        REZA: Here,
        use the ladder.
             Okay.
             Okay.
        (ALARM BLARING)
         We haven't got
         much time.
     SCARLETT: I know, I know.
      They have already
      cleared the area.
         I know, Reza.
         Hurry.
    Just follow me. Follow.
            Come on.
 Watch your step here.
        It's fine.
        Go, just go.
         Yes. Come on.

      We need to leave.
      We are too late.
     No, they are not
     blowing the caves up
     until sundown.
      We still have
      a few minutes.
      We're not leaving.
         Hurry, hurry!
             Yes.

         Oh, my God!
        It's even more
        beautiful than
        in the picture.
             Okay.
     We must hurry, please.
             Okay.
         There's more.
            What are you doing?
      They're going to
      blow it up anyway.
 I can't think straight
 with this thing on my head.
        They will
        hear you. Stop!
    I just need one minute.
         Oh, my God.

     SCARLETT: Oh, my God.
             Yeah?
             Reza?
         Do you know
         what this is?
                 I don't know.
         Oh, my God.
      It's the Rose Key.
      Oh, Reza.
            Careful.
         Please hurry.
         I'll be quick.
             Scarlett, stop it.

        I have to scan
        these markings.
        I'm not leaving.
     We must leave.
     Now! I can hear them.
     My father searched his
     entire life for this.
     I can't leave now.
     I have to get this.
          I'm sorry, Scarlett.
          I have a family!
      I know. It's okay.
             Be careful.
         I won't be long.

 His quest was
 a path to madness.
        My father wasn't crazy.

 for Flamel's stone
 is crazy.
     They all wind up dead.

 <i> by introducing yourself.</i>
        <i> Right.</i>
         (CLEARS THROAT)
        My name is
        Scarlett Marlowe
     and I'm a professor
     at University College,
     London.
    I have a Ph.D.
    in urban archeology,
    a master's in chemistry
      and another Ph.D.
      in symbology.
     I'm also fluent in
     four spoken languages
     and two dead ones.
      And I am a black
      belt in Krav Maga,
      so watch out.
         BENJI: That's a lot of
         degrees for someone
         your age.
  Yeah. My father insisted.
  We had a very
  studious household.
         Excuse me. One second.
 (STAMMERING)
          <i> Pardon.</i>
  <i> Pardon.</i>
      (SPEAKING FRENCH)
 <i> Merci.</i>
     <i> Merci beaucoup.</i>
          Thank you.
        You really need
        to learn French.
        Yeah, I do need
        to learn French.
        (CHUCKLES)
                 Your father.
            Yeah.
          What did he teach
          you about the
          philosopher's stone?
     Everything. That it's
     an elusive substance
     that could turn
     base metals into gold
    and can provide
    the key to eternal life.
 Sort of crude representation,
 but basically
  the creation of the stone
  was the goal of alchemy
      which was an early
      form of science
      which studied
      transformation
      in all its forms.
     And my father was
     actually the world's
     preeminent
     historian in alchemy.
        So, your father,
        there was a lot
        of speculation
      that he was
      mentally unstable.
      Is there any truth
      to that?
      Why? Because
      he killed himself?
     Six hundred years ago
        the greatest of
        the alchemists,
        Nicolas Flamel
    lived here,
    in this house in Paris.
        He was widely
        believed to have
        succeeded
    in developing
    the philosopher's stone
  which would have given him
  all the wealth
  he could dream of
         as well as
         eternal life.
     When grave robbers,
     hoping to get
    their hands on
    the philosopher's stone
 tried to dig his body up
 out of the cemetery
    that used to
    surround this area here
 they found his casket empty,
 as well as his wife's.
  Okay. So this is
  Nicolas Flamel's tombstone
     which he designed
     and carved himself.
    And my father
    believed that the clues
    to the location of
    the philosopher's stone
    were encoded somehow
    in these arcane symbols.
      But their meaning
      has remained
      a mystery until
     I discovered
     the fabled Rose Key.
         It's a kind of
         Rosetta stone
     used for translating
     alchemical symbols
     into Aramaic
         which,
         unfortunately,
         I don't speak.
         But luckily,
         I know a guy
         who does.
     What are you doing?
     I just have to open
     this door quietly.
     BENJI: Please don't.
     Scarlett!
 (DOOR SLAMMING SHUT)
     I can't believe you
     just did that. We just
     broke into a church!
     What does this guy do
     all the way up here?
     Uh. he likes to, um...
     ...break into places,
     like this
        and fix things.
     Impressive.
     That's a hell of a hobby.
             Yeah.
         SCARLETT:
         George? Hello?
    I saw your bag, George.
    I know you're here.
        Hi. How are you?
        Whatever it is,
        I want nothing
        to do with it.
 I didn't even
 say anything.
    I'll save you the time. No.
             Who's this guy?
             Who are you?
                     I'm Benji.
     He's making a
     documentary about my
     search for the stone.
              Ah. Of course.
          Do yourself a favor.
          Stay far away
          from this one.
      I just need to
      ask you one favor.
 GEORGE: Yeah. Just one favor.
     Benji, did she mention
     to you, the last time
     we were together
     I literally wound up
     in a Turkish prison?
 (CHUCKLING)
 George, it was not a prison.
 It was more of a jail.
        Jail, in Turkey.
 George, I'm sorry.
 I couldn't let
 the lead go dead.
                  God forbid.
  Well, chase your lead.
  See how far that gets you.
     I got a clock to fix.
     I found the Rose Key,
     George.
         (CHUCKLING)
             You did?
 Mmm-hmm.
                It was in Iran,
                wasn't it?
  Yes.
                I knew it.
    And I need your help
    translating the Aramaic.
         Wait a minute.
            Did you go to Iran?
 It doesn't matter
 who went there, George.
          You did, didn't you?
              By yourself?
  Doesn't matter
  who went.
             (CHUCKLES)
            You're a lunatic.
        She... You're...
        (LAUGHING)
        You're a crazy lunatic.
              (GEARS CREAKING)
      So, you fixed it.
      Yeah. Yeah, yeah!
     Go, go, go. Come on.
          SCARLETT:
          Are you okay, Benji?
         Yeah, I'm good.
             Okay.
 It's about to get
 really loud.
            Coming? You coming?
     BENJI:
     Yeah, yeah. I'm good.
         (CHURCH BELLS

     church bells ring
      for the first
      time in 284 years.
    I'll help you
    translate.
     But that's it.
    (INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
              She's pretty.
  BENJI:
  Yeah, she's really pretty.
  She's got great legs, too.
 She said we can have
 10 minutes. That's it.
                        Okay.
          How do you know her?
 Professional circles.
              Star is ammonia.
      Okay, great.
      Star is ammonia.
     Is this making any sense?
     Just keep going.
     Just keep them going.
                      Lime.
 Sword is lime?
             Sword is lime.
 Okay. And what about
 the key?
                         Uh...
                  No key.
 There's no key?
                     No.
     Why is there no key?
     He's carrying
     the key on his back.
     Look.
     So, if he's carrying
     the key on his back,
    does that mean that
    the key is on his back?
 It's on the back
 of the tombstone.
              Scarlett. No.
 I need to have
 a look behind here.
                 Scarlett, no!
                 Come on!
    I need you
    to help me.
                    Okay! Shit!
         Be careful. Let me...
         I need to see
         the back.
 Okay. I can't...
             Watch your foot.
 We're gonna
 have to put it down
 because I can't see.
                 Shit.
     There's nothing there.
        I can see that.
     Ammonia sulfonate,
     distilled, with lime.
      It's the mix of
      a couple of basic
      cleaning products.
 Help me out
 here, man.
     BENJI:
     What are you doing?
     Okay. You don't want
     to breathe this in.
      BENJI: This is not
      gonna end well.
        It's on the back.
        They will never see it.
     GEORGE: Oh, my God.
      And I need some matches.
 Matches? No. No.
 BENJI: We're not burning that.
          Benji, give me
          your matches.
 Scarlett, this is a museum!
 Are you out of your...
              Shut up!
                 Shit!
 GEORGE: Oh, my God!
 This is not okay!
         BENJI: Wow!
     GEORGE: Okay,
     that's pretty cool.
    That's not
    "go to jail" cool.
    But that's really cool.
             Wow.
              Get your camera.
        "Winged vulture
        leads the way
     "with brightest
     light in darkest day.
        "Underneath the
        heaven's reign

      shall be regained.
        "Halfway twixt
        the darkest gate
     "and this tablet laid
     atop a pairèd fate."
         So, "Underneath
         the heaven's reign,
            "what is lost
            shall be regained."
 "What is lost
 shall be regained."
    So that is,
    underneath the night sky
          or in the open?
 Or on the tablet.
 There's a night sky
 right on the tablet.
              Yes, good. Okay.
  So, darkest gate.
             Hell. Hell.
             Darkest gate,
             the gates of Hell.
 The gates of Hell.
                 Right?
  Yeah.
  The gates of Hell.
 Okay, but that
 doesn't give us anything.
 I mean, that's halfway
 between this grave
 and the gates of Hell.
             No, wait.
             I have my dad's
             notebook.
             Oh, my God. Okay.
             So this marks what
             they believe to be
            the distance
            between Heaven
            and Earth and Hell.
     If alchemists believed
     that the number of
     the Devil was 741
 then it makes sense
 that they would think
 that Hell was 741 feet
 beneath the surface
 of the Earth, right?
            So halfway twixt...
  So, 370.5 feet
  beneath Flamel's
  tombstone
     is where we'll
     find the stone!
          BENJI: Wait.
          Hold on, guys.
          How are we
     supposed to get 370
     feet into the Earth?
 The catacombs. Right?
         BENJI: The what?
 Okay, we're in Paris, so
 there are over
 200 miles of tunnels
 right underneath our feet.
             That are holding
             the remains of six
             million corpses.
      BENJI: Whoa, whoa.
      Six million corpses?
                         Yeah.
 That's where I would put it!
              Right. Of course
              you would.
      Flamel's grave was here.
 With the catacomb map,
 would make it roughly...
  There. Shit.
         Wait. Are you sure?
     BENJI: What is it?
     What happened?
                 Shit!
     Catacombs don't go
     under Flamel's grave.
     But if we burrowed
     through this wall here...
 No, you can't.
             In this tunnel...
 The walls are solid
 limestone. There's no way
 you can burrow in.
 Plus, they've all
 been reinforced
 since pieces of
 the city fell into the...
                  Well then...
 Wait a minute,
 wait a minute.
         In 1774,
 about a hundred feet
 of Avenue Denfert-Rochereau
    was literally swallowed
    up into the ground
    by the city.
  A couple of years later,
  the same thing happened...
      Barrière d'Enfer,
      right there.
     Followed by
     a third collapse.
 Rue des Innocents.
     BENJI: Why would
     the street collapse
     if there's nothing
     but solid
     ground underneath it?
 That's a good
 question, Benji.
      So there's
      a hidden chamber?
 It would appear so.
             We have to
             get down there.
 You have to
 get down there.
    I don't go underground.
    Remember?
                 Yes.
                 Sorry.
              By the end
              of the 1700s,
      residents from
      all over Paris
      began to complain
 about the horrible
 smell of the bodies
 in the overcrowded cemetery.
  Something had to be done.
        Benji, get this.

         These remains are
         from the same cemetery
         as the Flamel graves.
            Which means that...
      Yeah, we basically
      need to go
      about half a mile
      through this wall.
     We need to find a way
     into the off-limits
     area of the catacombs.
            MAN: Go to the club
            called Le Showcase.
             Sorry?
      Ask for Papillon.
      He'll bring you.
        BENJI: Papillon?
 TOUR GUIDE: Please!
         Thanks.
  Come back into the group.
  Please. Come on.
             Sorry.
         Are you sure
         this is where
         we're supposed to go?
     Yeah, I think it's...
      I think it's just
      down here.
 What's his name again?
             Papillon.
                Papillon?
            Yeah.
             Okay.

      (SPEAKING FRENCH)
     Yes, what do you want?
             I need to get
             into the catacombs
        and someone told me
        that you could take me.
  (LAUGHING)
    No, sorry. Do I look
    like a tour guide to you?
                Do I look
                like a tourist?
  Okay, why would I want
  to bring you down there?
         Because we have
         found a secret tunnel
             in the catacombs
             that no one else
             knows about.
                  Look.
     No. I know that place.
     We would have found
     it if it was there.
         No, you wouldn't have.
         Yes, we would.
      No, you wouldn't have,
      because it was designed,
          years and years ago,
          to be invisible.
        Unless you knew
        it was there, you would
        never find it.
 Why would that be?
         Because I believe it's
         filled with treasure.
     You know what I mean?
 Treasure,
 yeah, I know what you mean.
    (LAUGHING)
    It's a joke.
    I mean, is she serious?
             I'm 100% serious.
         If it's true,
 me and my friends,
 can we take half
 of the treasure?
        You can have all
        of the treasure.
              It's not what
              I'm looking for.
      Half is fine.
             Okay.
             So you'll take us?
      Yes, I said okay.
          Try this.
                 No, I'm sorry,
                 I'm not going.
 No, he's coming.
 He's coming.
                I'm not coming.
 George, come on, please.
 I need your help.
             You can text me
             whatever you find
         down there.
         I'm gonna be around...
      No. You can't.

  This is Zed, our climber.

            the banshee.

             And then
             it's a bit tricky.
         PAPILLON:
         There's water to here.
             And we're prepared
             for that? We have
             enough equipment?
                  Yeah, we got
                  everything.
      BENJI: Zed, right?
      How do you know
      Papillon?
  Oh, I grew up with him.
  He's my friend, you know.
        Do you know how
        he got the scar
        on his hand?
             Don't talk about
             that to him.
 Souxie, what are the dangers
 that we're facing
 when we go down there?
            If you run out
            of batteries,
            with no flashlight,
             you will die.
      If you run out of water,
      if you get hurt.
 ZED: And there are
 also dangers like
 police and bats,
     rats, claustrophobia,
     drowning, bugs.
                         Yeah.
  De Niro?
  You want to see De Niro?
          Yes, yes.

             And I suggest
             you pull your
             hands up like this
                 so these bones
                 don't cut.

    going through there.
    Yes, it's the only way.
    Fuck that, man.
    I'm not climbing
    over bones.
     GEORGE: That's a great
     tour guide you got.
      What did you say?
 If you need a tour guide,
 you get a tour guide who say,
        "Look over here,
        look over there"
      and everything.
      But that's not me.
     If you want to find
     your hidden treasure,
     that's the way.
         Wait. Papillon, look.
         That isn't actually
         the right way.
      This one here.
      This is a much
      more direct route.
 Sometimes the wrong
 direction is better.
        No.
 Nobody uses
 this corridor.
        Why not?
             It's a bad place.
     What do you mean,
     it's a bad place?
     Is it dangerous or...
 Bad like, people
 who go in this tunnel
 don't come out.
         We're talking about
         some kind of urban
         legend or something.
          This could save us
          hours upon hours.
 You think because
 you see something
 in a book, you know it?
                 Just look at
                 the map, here.
     Okay, this?
     This is not
     the catacombs.
 This will not
 tell you anything.
 Tell me, which ones
 are filled with water?
  Which ones have collapsed?
  Which ones are evil?
                 You don't need
                 to be yelling.
 You don't know!
        We had a friend
        named La Taupe.
  In English, <i> "la taupe"</i>
 <i> c'est</i> "the mole."
 He lived down here
 for years.
 He knew every
 corridor of every system,
 except this one.
     He knew there was
     something horrible
     down there.
     But eventually,
     he had to see
     what it was.
     He went inside
     and nobody has
     seen him since.
      So if you want
      to take this way,
     go ahead.
     Not with me.
                         Or me.
      It's the best way.
      These people have
      been here before.
     We haven't.
 If that rock is down here,
 then it's been down
 here for 600 years.
 I think it can wait
 a couple more hours.

      and steady, yeah?

      No, no.
      I think I'm stuck.
        I can't see you.

         Okay. Fuck.
            Just move
            your shoulder down.
              No, no, no.
          I'm stuck.
         Just move back, Benji.

        Just calm down.
        It's okay.
              No, no.
              I can't breathe.
        No, it's okay.
        Benji, you can.

  Just breathe
  with me, please.

        out of the way.
    Just get out of the way.
    Just get out of
    the fucking way!
    You are gonna
    have to move back
    a tiny bit, please.
      I can't move back.
      Just go forward!

             Go forward!

     Fuck. I think
     it's gonna collapse!

         BENJI: Fuck!
     (SCARLETT COUGHING)
          Fuck.
 It's collapsed.
     That was so
     fucking close.
              Oh, my God.
                Wait.
                     Fuck.
 SCARLETT: Wait.
 Tell me we didn't just
 go in a circle.
        This isn't here.
         This is the same
         tunnel, no?
        PAPILLON:
        This isn't here.
        Believe me. No, no, no.
 Look, I thought
 you said you knew
 where we were going!
     Wait. Listen to me.
        Hey, hey, hey,
        Benji! Stop it!
      Listen, I'm sorry.
      I'm sorry!
      Benji, I'm sorry!
              Calm down!
     But listen to me.
     This doesn't go here.
        Okay, calm down.
    This is the tunnel.
     There is no turns.
     There is no turns.
      This is straight.
     I don't understand.
     BENJI: What the hell
     do we do now, huh?
      This is all right.
      Okay.
         PAPILLON:
         We shouldn't
         go this way.
        ZED: Let's go,
        grab your shit.
  PAPILLON:
  We shouldn't go in there!

    There's no other option.

            Benji? Let me help.
            Let me help.
         BENJI: Okay.

                 What the hell
                 is this?
            Great. Very funny.
            So you have never
            been here before.
                 No.
 (SOUXIE SPEAKING FRENCH)
        I've never
        been here, okay?
      What the hell
      is this, then?
     People just tag
     your name on the wall?
            I swear I've never
            been here.
    I didn't do this,
    okay?
             Who did it, then?
     I don't know.
     I don't know.
            For goodness' sake.
             You better not be

 Did you hear that?
        Is that a phone?
 Are there phones down here?
  The phone company used to
  run lines through here,
  but they...
        Run lines through here?
     Yeah.
  They must have left some.
             No.
     Fifty years ago,
     they took everything.

  This is wrong.
     Scarlett! Scarlett!
 Barrière d'Enfer.
 This is the spot
 I was talking about.
 This is where the buildings
 collapsed into the ground.
  Hundreds of people
     fell to their
     death right here.
             Yes.
             And when they sent
             people to fix it,
          50 more disappeared.
     How the hell did they
     get a piano down here?
     BENJI: Maybe it
     fell when one of
     the houses collapsed.
                    You gotta
                    be kidding.
  When I was a kid,
  we had a piano that
  looked exactly like this.
              Really?
        Danny and I used to
        play it all the time.
        We only knew one song.
              <i> My Bonnie Lies</i>
              <i> over the Ocean.</i>
        You remember that song?
    We could never finish it
    because the A4 key
    was fucked up.
                    George...
        This is a trip.

 La Taupe.

 SCARLETT:
 That's La Taupe?
 I thought you were dead.
         You never even
         came to look for me.
                 Never.

     where we're going.
     You are looking
     to get out.
 SCARLETT: Yes. Yes.
                     Come.
 Benji, wait for them.
 Let him go first.
     BENJI: How did he get
     up there so fast?

             Yeah.

     The only way out
     is down.

                 It looks deep.
 This is a bad idea.
  SCARLETT: This space that
  we're looking for,
  the hidden chamber...
     Didn't you notice
     that it was perfectly
     wedged
    between the east system
    and the south system
    of the catacombs?
 GEORGE: So it's got
 to connect them.
         Yeah. Exactly.
    If we find the chamber,
    then that's the way out.
    We'll find a way out.

                 Are you sure?
 I think. I'm sure.

        What if there's
        no chamber?
              There is.
              It's down there.
             Okay.
 SCARLETT: George,
 it's another 20 meters.
     Are you at the bottom?
             Yeah.
      Okay. I'll be down
      in a second.

         I don't know!
        I got you. I got you.

      one of the packs.
  Just let me know
  if you want me
  to change them.

  Before.
        So, they still believed
        everything revolved
        around the Earth.
 Which means the Earth
 didn't count as a planet.
      Right. But the Moon did.
 And so did the Sun.

          Holy shit!

        BENJI: Scarlett.
             Benji.
    Let's not celebrate
    until we're out of here.
    Scarlett, how are
    these torches still lit?
         The philosopher's
         stone can fuel a lamp
         for eternity.
     Where is it?
     Where's the stone?
        "Brightest light
        in darkest day."
        Think about it.
              Brightest light.
     Yeah.
                  The Sun.
     In ancient Egypt,
     they said that
     the Earth god
            and the sky goddess
            were madly in love.
          But when they had
          their first child,
          the Sun,
  he became so jealous
  of their affections
  that he pushed them apart
      so that they were
      only able to touch
                 by the palms
                 of their hands
                 and the soles
                 of their feet.
             Every morning,
             the sky goddess
             gave birth
             to the Sun,
            and every evening
         she would swallow him
         back up.
  That's it!
     Oh, my God.
     It looks so ordinary.
  What better place to hide
  the most valuable
  stone ever known
     than next to riches
     you could never miss?
      Wait. It's a trap.
      Stop! It's a trap!
    Stop! It's a trap! Wait!

             Are you okay?
             I'm okay.
              Are you okay?
    Okay, get her.

     that's a good idea.
     GEORGE:
     He can't breathe!
    Don't disturb the rocks!
      George, they might
      collapse on us!
            GEORGE: Fuck!
    We can't move the rocks.
    We can't.
 There's no use.
 There's no use.
                GEORGE: No use,
                Papillon?
 No!
     I need the first-aid kit.
     I have to clean it.
            No, don't touch it!
 PAPILLON: The packs
 are buried.
        BENJI: What do you mean
        they're buried?
    They're buried!
                 BENJI: Do we
                 have anything?
             Sorry, I'm sorry.
  GEORGE: Where's our water?
  Our food?
  Do we have any batteries?
  For the lights?
     Yeah, we should start
     conserving the lights.
             Shit!
         What do I do?
        Just keep it up,
        so that it stops
        bleeding.
             Okay.
                Okay.
                It's all right.
                It's okay.
             This might sting.
         Just a sting.
          (GROANING)
 It's okay. It's okay.
 (SPEAKING FRENCH)
    BENJI: Holy shit!
      It really worked.
 How did you do that?
                It's the stone.
                 You okay?
          Yeah.
      (SPEAKING FRENCH)
 It will be okay.
          They'd never build
          something like this
          without a back door,
             in case it
             collapsed, right?
    Never. There's
    gotta be something else.
 Look around.
 Everybody look around.
         BENJI: What are we
         looking for?
 I don't know.
      Is there anything?
        ZED: Some bones.
             What is that?
             Is that something?
     Yes. Yes. Yes. George!
         What is it?
  It's the <i> Porta Alchemica.</i>
  This is the door
  to the mystical!
         Wait. This is a door?
         That's a door?
     No, not exactly.
     It works in
     conjunction with this.
             Here.
     This is
     "As above, so below."
    That phrase is believed
    to be the key to all magic.
              It means that
             what is within me
             is outside of me.
            As it is on Earth,
            so it is in heaven.
             As I am,
             so are my cells,
          so are my atoms,
          so is God.
                 Basically,
             as I believe
             the world to be,
             so it is.
    BENJI: I'm not following.
     As above, so below.
    So if they carved
    a door on the ceiling...
              There has got to
              be a door on
              the floor, too.
 Yeah. Someone
 hand me a rock.
            All right.
              Wait. We are
              in the bottom of
              the catacombs.
            There's nothing
            below us, Scarlett.
             Shit.
     If this is the floor
     then where is all
     that water going?
      There's a way out.
 SOUXIE:
 Are you okay?
         Yeah. Yeah.
    Guys, there's a passage
    down here.
     Come down. It's okay.
            Souxie.
      Watch out, Benji.
          Can you read that?
          What does it say?
     "Abandon all hope,
     ye who enter here."
        PAPILLON: What?
                 According to
                 mythology,
        that's the inscription
        over the gates of Hell.
    PAPILLON: What?
        I'm not going in there.
 I thought you didn't
 believe in any of this.
                      I don't.
  "And they shall be made
  to crawl on their bellies
  "to enter
  the kingdom of darkness."
  Yeah, that occurred
  to me, too.
                 Yeah.
             Shit.
             Fuck.
     It's exactly the same.
      SCARLETT:
      No. No, it's not.
        It's not exactly
        the same.
 Everything's
 the wrong way around.
     This is upside down.

 What?
                  No.
     BENJI: What the fuck?
              What happened to
              the entrance?
         Jesus.
                  Are we dead?
        No.
    We're not dead.
 We should just

 We have to
 find a way out.

      Okay. I rectified.
  Where's the hidden stone?
    George. George,
    do you hear me? George?
         (COUGHING)
      Shut up. Come on.
      Come on, come on.
            As above
          so below.
        As I believe
        the world to be,
        so it is.
        Hold on, George.
             Dad.
          I'm sorry
     that I didn't pick up
     the phone that night.
    I didn't know you
    were in that much pain.
        (PANTING AND STRAINING)
            George?
             Zed!
         Where are you?
        Scarlett! Here!
 Did you
 find the stone?
              Yes!
             Okay.
     How did you do that?
          (COUGHING)
                      Hi.
                     George?
                  George?
 Come here.
     Scarlett, Scarlett.
     Go, go.
      Give me your hand.
         SCARLETT: Zed!
          Zed! Zed!
          Dead end!
             Watch out!
     ZED: Shit, my lamp! Shit!
        SCARLETT: Hurry!
    ZED: We will never be
    able to climb down that.
              We have to jump.
 What?
      We have to
      rectify ourselves
             and jump.
     Scarlett, you're crazy.
         We will die.
            No. George, listen.
     Why do you keep
     seeing your brother
     down here?
      What is it about his
      death that torments you?
          George. George.
            It's not
            gonna work.
    Why is he haunting you?
         When Danny got
         his leg pinned
      I promised him I'd
      be back with help.
 But I got lost along the way.
 My brother drowned
 waiting for me to save him.
                It's okay.
             Zed.
  I have a child
  I've never seen.
     I know it's mine,
     but I deny it.
         It's okay.
         Give me your hand.
         Scarlett, it's not
         gonna work.
         George.
             I can't.
     I won't go without you.
            I won't.
             Okay.
             Okay.
 We go on three.
      On three.
             One.
                     Two.
     Three.
          (CRASHING)
         (ALL COUGHING)
             Fuck!
     Save the light.
                ZED: Yeah.
             We are trapped?
      SCARLETT: No.
                      Fuck!
         Fuck! No! Fuck!
                  Zed! Zed!
 We'll die!
     (SHUSHING)
  We'll die!
      GEORGE: Hey! Down.
     Put the light down.
             Help me get
             the rocks.
             It's a manhole.
             Find a grip.
             Find a grip.
     Can you get your
     fingers in the sides?
             Just try! Try!
        I'm trying!
            I can't.
     Scarlett,
     what did you just do?
            Pushed it down.
              Okay. Okay.
        SCARLETT:
        One, two, three.
         Oh, my God.
             GEORGE:
             We're gonna push
             it straight down.
              Down and
              to the side.
            Okay.
             One, two, three.
      Good, good, good.
      Get it over here.
              Holy shit!
         Zed.
              Hello?
             We gotta get out.
            Get the camera out.

        <i> People say that</i>
    I'm some kind of
