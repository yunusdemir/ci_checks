<i>July 29</i>
<i>Economic Crisis:
The Doldrums</i>
Oh well...
Life is hot air.
Hey, Hector.
Julot, hi.
What's up?
Just enjoying summer.
Today's date and my pretend car
behind me.
That'll get you nowhere.
You should do like me,
take night classes.
Stop being a museum guard.
Hi, guys! Is this your car?
'Course.
Join me for a drink?
I'm with a friend at the Young Bar.
Sure, ok.
Bring your friend.
He's not my friend.
Don't know the guy.
Bye.
Oh well...
I need to forget the Bastille girl.
THE RENDEZ-VOUS OF DÃ‰JÃ€-VU
"Insurrection"!
Get your "Insurrection"!
Get your "Insurrection" here!
Get your "Insurrection"!
Step right up!
Try out some revolution.
You won't be going on vacation
with that.
Not my fault people are stingy.
Everyone's fallen on tough times,
like you.
Impossible. There's too many of us.
"Insurrection"!
Step right up!
Get your "Insurrection"!
There you are!
How's it going?
What's this?
A cobblestone. Made of foam.
Usually I sell lots
but today's slow.
Miss!
Hey, Sternest!
Communist crap...
Look, Sternest! A mini guillotine.
That's great. I like that.
Can we have a demonstration?
Just like back in the day.
Lift, insert a finger,
and like back then...
paf!
- Love it!
- I'll take it.
It's 40... 50...
I mean 60.
So many were guillotined...
The Revolution was not all good.
Times are tough this year.
50 euros is better than nothing.
I'm heading home. Wanna come?
I gotta work, the museum's open.
Any luck finding a 1-bedroom?
There's one! 300 m2!
You're in luck!
That criminal was stopped
thanks to police weapons.
New weapons.
Turn around, sir.
The bullets enter the spinal cord,
travel up to the brain and explode.
The most effective way
to stop petty, neighborhood crime.
If you don't possess such weapons,
you can always resort
to self-defense.
Nice parade this year.
I maintain that the Revolution
was not all good!
We know, you told us.
I have an idea. This'll be fun.
Insert your finger.
Glad you came.
The museum will be dead.
Everyone's at the parade.
I got a new coworker!
In the next room.
That's him!
His name is Hector.
Go on, check him out!
Don't be shy!
Shit, he saw me!
Let me show you something!
Look. He lives here!
It's hot in here.
- Want a cocktail?
- Sure.
Got a knife?
Nope.
What can we do?
Look, an axe!
Cool.
Makes me wanna go on vacation.
Great place.
Do like him. Live at your job.
Yeah, except I don't have a job.
I can't house you forever.
What if I find a boyfriend?
Maybe I will.
Are we still on for vacation?
Yeah, but... Could you loan me
some money till September?
I need my degree
to get me a job, urgently.
Got your degree?
Yeah. Found out yesterday.
Dang! Looks like
they've been here a while.
I don't get it! I worked hard.
Didn't you cheat a little too?
That's never stopped anyone
from succeeding.
Guess they must've known.
They only give diplomas
to dunces here.
Hey, there's Julot!
No more night school,
you passed this time!
What're you talking about?
You're on the list.
Yeah, the list of people who failed.
I see!
So that's why I'm not on it...
Hilarious! So I got it!
Sorry for you, but no big deal,
stuff happens, chin up.
This is the fourth time I've failed!
They only give diplomas
to dunces here!
Don't say that.
At least you've got vacation.
- Taking your girlfriend?
- No.
I mean yes. I mean no.
She's going with that guy
over there.
By the java machine.
He's top of the list
of people who passed.
Right, I see.
At least you'll have time to study.
- What's that?
- Don't touch!
Sorry.
At least you have an apartment.
Yeah, except I don't. I got kicked
out for playing music on Music Day.
That's when my girlfriend met
that guy.
Well, bye.
Good luck getting some good luck.
<i>Temp Generation</i>
<i>EuroLabor Temp Agency</i>
<i>The stock market crashed again
today.</i>
<i>How can we increase profits?</i>
<i>By firing everybody and...</i>
Hello!
I just graduated.
I'm ready to enter the workforce.
I came to see about job
availabilities.
Here's my diploma.
Here.
THE RIGHT DIPLOMAS
- It's no good.
Proof of address?
I live at a friend's.
I have an email address.
You need a domicile.
I can't get a job without a flat
or a flat without a job.
Maybe the rules need to change.
That's how it is.
I don't make the rules.
The computer won't process you.
We can't afford to give jobs to
people who can't provide guarantees.
Guarantees of what?
Guarantees you want to earn money.
If you need money for rent,
we know you'll work.
Right. Ok.
If that's how you feel,
I'm going on vacation! Goodbye!
That's it, go on vacation.
The crisis'll never end
with people like her!
I know! You and Hector
will accidentally meet!
It never fails!
Can't you see that girl is lost?
Go on!
Pator!
You won't believe it.
What's all this?
- What's with her?
- She's a lost soul.
Too picky, never satisfied...
now she's alone.
She blew guys off for 30 years.
Now life has blown her off.
She's been blown off, and hard.
By life, I mean.
It's too late. You hear me?
The sands of time.
So what's the story?
The police came
and searched the whole office.
Luckily, Dr. Afterbirth had left.
More accurately,
he was about to leave...
Time erases everything.
That's not true. On the contrary.
Everything stays, and accumulates.
Doctor, what's my diagnosis?
You'll lose your sight,
hearing, sense of smell,
ability to talk, sense of touch,
intellectual capacities,
then slip into...
a slow state of lethargy.
How will I manage my money?
He said, "An apple a day
keeps the doctor away."
And I said, "You're right, sir.
That's the difference between
French and American healthcare."
You're scraping the floor.
Put it there.
The guy was so pissed off!
I prefer a doctor to an apple!
Pator, I've got an emergency.
A date with my wife.
- Monique?
- Marie-Jo! It's Friday.
We'll pick this up later.
Everybody says,
"There's no money
for public health."
I mean, c'mon!
The money's not gone,
the dream is gone.
Public healthcare
was created with dreams.
Hope for a healthy world.
- Take off your shirt.
- I just put it back on.
Mind if I smoke?
Are you sure you're a doctor?
Are you sure you're a doctor?
Can't you tell?
You're young.
You're young.
Less and less, I assure you.
Surely you're aware
of the fleeting passage of time.
Am I going to die, Doctor?
That, old boy...
we guarantee 100%.
But when?
I'm on five different
boards of directors.
I'm an advisor
at the Industrial Ministry,
honorary professor at The Sorbonne,
and more.
I'm even a cultural advisor
at UNESCO.
If I die, who will replace me?
Someone like you.
And when that person dies?
Nobody.
Nobody?
When people get fed up,
really, really fed up,
they'll have a revolution...
to overthrow people like you.
You wanted a diagnosis?
There's your diagnosis.
Pator? I mean... Dr. Pator?
The police want to see
Dr. Afterbirth.
Odd...
Sure they're not here for this guy?
Malpractice... ever heard of it?
I'd forgotten about the summons
for an immediate arraignment.
Malpractice... ever heard of it?
<i>Things went downhill
when I shot at them.</i>
<i>They tried to handcuff me,
hit me with their billy clubs...</i>
The papers, Pator.
Mind if I smoke?
Down with the pigs!
- We'll get you!
- Will not!
<i>Turns out Dr. Afterbirth</i>
had been practicing
without a license since 1968!
They found out
I don't have a degree either.
There you go.
The office is closed.
My boss is on the run
and so am I.
What's up with you?
I've gone bananas.
Over a pretty face.
It was Bastille Day.
The more I try to forget...
the more I remember.
And the more I remember...
the more she appears.
There, there...
there.
Did you talk to her?
Not right away. Not really.
Careful!
If you do nothing,
you run the risk of regret.
Especially with a pretty girl.
What's she look like?
A statue...
A Greek statue.
From the Ionian period.
Interesting.
What can I say?
It was at the museum.
Right here.
I was over there.
The girl was behind that statue.
Nice Greek statue. Excellent choice.
<i>It's like truth.</i>
<i>Behind every truth lies
another truth.</i>
<i>But which truth doesn't lie?</i>
<i>Which one is the model?</i>
<i>The statue, or the girl?</i>
Hector!
Can't you see that girl is lost?
Go on!
Hello.
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, ok.
How old is she?
Who?
The statuette.
- 3,000 years and 2 months.
- And 2 months?
When I started,
they told me she was 3,000.
And I've been here 2 months.
Shall I whip it out?
Excuse me?
The statuette.
Are you allowed?
I'm the guard.
Thanks.
Well... see you around.
Wait!
Wait!
What's your name?
Just call me Truc.
Wait! Truc's not a girl's name.
Truquette, then!
When I put back the statuette...
no more Charlotte or the brunette.
But I've got a plan.
They live together.
They're going on vacation.
We could do the same.
I mean...
with them.
You lost your job. And I don't want
to lose the brunette.
Call her right now.
Right now?
They'll never say yes!
Pretty girls are for other guys.
Watch this.
If a couple of guys like us
invited you on vacation with us...
Would you go?
I would.
- You?
- I do whatever she does.
See? Easy as pie. Just ask them.
Whiskey!
Got a phone?
Got one.
- Call her!
- Hang on...
Remember what happened
with the redhead?
- Remember?
- Go on, call her.
The redhead wouldn't kiss me.
So I kissed her friend.
We started dating.
But the redhead,
jealous at losing her best friend,
did all she could to break us up.
She got her friend back.
And me...
my bitterness.
I think of her
at the mention of AndrÃ© Breton.
She had the name of the girl
in his book ending in an asylum.
Some girls you forget.
Others, because of a book,
a sunbeam,
a scent...
you never forget.
Exactly.
A memory is better than nothing.
Memories are like vacation.
They take you on a trip.
Call her.
Hello, Charlotte? It's Hector.
I know a guy with a car.
We're heading south.
Would you two like to join us?
Pator, nice guy.
Happy?
Everything's so well organized,
he won't even know!
Wrong!
Bet you didn't expect this!
Take that!
We're at the cafe, having coffee...
So it's yes?
Shall we meet at the bridge
over the street?
Ok. See you tomorrow.
Wait for me!
- Who's that jerk?
- My brother!
- I missed my train!
- Come with us.
Don't move.
Let's get going.
I'm expected at the beach.
I'm a lifeguard.
<i>As they left Paris, Hector thought,</i>
<i>"The Eiffel Tower beams
to the Sandwich Islands."</i>
<i>Pator thought of the monuments
that are now billboards.</i>
<i>The Palais de Justice, MusÃ©e d'Orsay</i>
<i>and The Louvre, where Hector worked.</i>
<i>As they left Paris,
Truquette thought of the Seine.</i>
<i>It flows toward the sea,
passing through Paris</i>
<i>like a dream
weaving through the mysteries</i>
<i>and miseries of Paris.</i>
<i>Off they flew,
on the wings of freedom.</i>
<i>Administrative Law</i>
<i>Seduction 101</i>
Hit the gas.
This is what I call vacation!
Women, booze, wheels...
Thanks, Front Populaire!
"When a woman drinks,
her guard is down."
Want some more?
Yeah, I'm thirsty.
Thanks.
- Me too!
- Just a little.
If we drive like the bourgeoisie,
we won't get stopped.
I took the back roads.
Fewer cops.
Looks like a painting in the museum.
Give me your hat.
Come on, Pator.
Aren't you hungry?
Make sure there's no cops.
I'm wanted by the cops.
This is a bad idea.
Car trouble?
Just fixed her.
Changed her carburetor fluid.
Boy, was she thirsty!
Maybe you are too?
Parisians?
Here in the village
we love Parisians!
I'll fire up the stove.
Be seated.
I'll rustle up a little something.
Parisians!
Check out my new app.
And the best part...
- Not bad, eh?
- Awesome!
Vacationing?
Yeah, with my friends over there.
I'll be your friend if you like.
I'm an ad man.
Vacation... like, wow!
Come with me if you like.
You and your pretty friend.
- Fruit?
- I'm eating with them.
C'mon, it's delicious!
Sorry guys, I just met a great guy!
I'm going with him.
That guy?
I think he's already gone!
I don't see what you saw
in that ad man.
He reminded me of an ex.
- Remember? The train guy.
- What became of him?
Not much.
He went nuts. Hopped the train.
Took a one-way trip
to the center of his mind.
Shit, that's sad.
I've got a story too.
I haven't always been alone.
It's about a guy.
Me.
He had a girl under his skin.
One day the girl left
and the guy got skin cancer.
But it was the girl who died.
Look, July tourists heading home!
They're trying to tell us something!
- I'll flash my brights.
- Honk!
Something's wrong.
Car trouble?
Everything's ok, I don't get it.
Why were they signaling to us?
"Make your fantasies come true..."
EASY PICK-UP SPOTS<i>
Movie theaters, fun fairs...</i>
<i>France is out of gas
but full of debt!</i>
<i>Shop the recession away!</i>
<i>When I vacation
I deepen the deficit</i>
<i>Fun Fair</i>
All's well. She's perfect.
Told you it was a great idea!
Maybe it still works.
Give me your things
so you don't break or lose them.
Hey, look!
You can win a cell phone.
Got change?
If only life was always like this...
Can't wait to be seaside.
There you are.
Almost lost you again!
Why don't you go check out
the Ghost Maze?
I've got another attraction for you.
- Sure it was her?
- Yeah, on the bumper cars.
I'll never forget her with this!
Pity I lost 1,000
on that 3-card trick.
- Step right up.
- Speak of the devil.
Only 1 euro. Perfectly safe.
1 euro...
Here you are, sir.
Slip your arm inside.
See? Perfectly safe!
Marcel, come here!
Brilliant!
Let's try.
We'll save a euro.
You'll feel better
about the guillotine.
The guillotine was not all good.
Stop, stop!
Come look! Easy money.
Smells like trouble.
Red queen, joker.
Red queen...
Find the red queen.
Keep your eyes peeled.
Here are the 2 jokers.
Piece of cake.
Red queen...
Here we go. Eyes peeled.
Follow her.
Where is she?
Miss? Fellas?
- The other one.
- Lost, fellas!
The young lady wins.
Another round.
Concentrate.
Keep your eyes on her.
The game guy's hot.
Concentrate.
Keep your eyes on her.
Watch the cards.
Ready?
Find the red queen. Here we go.
Red queen, red queen...
Where is she?
No, that one. On the end.
Middle card, you lose.
You win, Miss!
Pony up!
- Place your bets.
- Trouble's brewing.
There you are! Nearly lost you!
Pator!
I scared the bejeezus out of you!
Trouble with the cops?
I live nearby now.
Drop by for a bite.
My wife'll fix dinner.
My divorced sister-in-law'll
be there!
Meet my kid.
I wanna go on the Ferris wheel!
Sunshine!
The good life!
Democracy!
Capitalism!
General de Gaulle! Vacation!
Not so hard, you'll damage them!
What's wrong with you?
You seem upset.
Did I vote in your laws?
Look at this rag!
Did I abolish vacation?
Take that! I'll get 'em all!
See how they are?
I'm no terrorist.
I'm a mild-mannered guide!
They cancelled a month of summer?
"An exceptional measure
for an exceptional crisis"?
"The government
puts France back to work"?
Leaves me 2 days to lose the loser
and his bum friend.
How will I pull it off?
The mafia is after us!
Big trouble!
- What mafia?
- The 3-card mafia!
Let's hit the beach!
They'll distract them.
- Where are they?
- We lost them.
- Up there we'll find them.
- Go for it.
- Your sight is better.
- Yeah. You go, Charlotte.
Wimps!
Gotta find someone!
I don't see them.
- See them?
- No, I don't!
I don't see them!
Charlotte, do you see them?
There they are!
Run after them!
- What?
- Do you see them?
There they are! Leaving!
Articulate!
In the parking lot! Leaving!
I see them, I see them!
Coming!
Hold your horses...
It's you!
- What're you doing here?
- Car trouble.
- Broke down?
- Stolen.
My brother took off with it.
Who are these people?
My wife!
Meet Mrs. Afterbirth, my wife.
This is Hector, Pator and Charlotte.
Friends of mine!
Why are they here?
We're hoping Dr. Afterbirth
can loan us his car.
- No problem.
- But we use it!
Of course!
But there's an old one in the shed.
Last time we loaned a car
we never saw it again.
Keep it, I don't use it.
Stay for dinner!
We're having horse soup.
We're expecting the Guillotins!
Shit.
Cancel them.
They haven't left yet,
and with what's going on...
Make yourselves at home.
Take the foot pads.
Just like at home.
- With what's going on...
- What's going on?
- Don't you know?
- What?
They shortened summer by a month.
They shortened summer?
Yes. By a month.
Would he do 25 pages
of vacation homework for fun?
He's got 3 days to finish.
See for yourselves.
<i>The cancellation of summer
has provoked riots</i>
<i>led by various
anarchic-unionist groupuscules.</i>
<i>The President has called in the Army</i>
<i>to restore order...</i>
I can't see through you!
<i>The cancellation of summer
has provoked riots</i>
<i>led by various
anarchic-unionist groupuscules...</i>
How about a game show?
We'll be kicked out of Europe.
<i>The President...</i>
They put Sarkozy back!
<i>to restore order...</i>
Proof we're going downhill.
<i>The cancellation of summer...</i>
<i>The cancellation of summer...</i>
- What'd I tell you?
- There's nothing left.
Wanna eat on the wall plates?
Why didn't you say so?
Is the grub ready?
Is it ready?
Let's go.
- Who'd you get?
- Louis XVI.
I got his execution.
Louis XVI and his executioner...
200 years later, the same guys
have all the money and power.
Same shitty pyramid.
Trains are packed,
the stock market's gone wild
and the unions are back at work.
We'll be going.
Sit down!
I made all this food.
Great wine...
Soup's on!
Help yourselves.
Mix 'em up, they're all good.
Pop the cork!
We really have to go.
Horse soup, yummy!
Down the hatch!
Smells like horse.
It's not as good as last time.
- Great vintages.
- They've split France in two.
I hear envious August tourists
attacked some July tourists.
Pretty good for Beaujolais.
Strange, your friend
stealing your wheels...
How could you get robbed
by one of your own?
It was the gunshots.
I lost sight of my brother...
Shit, it's my fault!
- What gunshots?
- At the fun fair.
You went to the fun fair?
No, he's joking!
Kid!
Didn't Dad take you
to the speech therapist?
You didn't go to the fun fair,
did you?
No...
See?
Shit, I forgot cocktail hour!
Everyone to the living room.
You'll serve soup again later.
What I love in life is...
good whiskey
while listening to...
jazz...
that sizzles!
Liberty!
It needs a new diamond
and so does my wife.
Whiskey!
- Ice?
- No, thanks.
Thanks.
I'm happy to see you again.
I've got my favorite whiskey
and my favorite music,
I'm with my favorite friends,
and I'm going to sit
in my favorite chair.
Something's troubling you.
I get the impression
you're experiencing a form
of psychological substitution.
Your wife looks
far too much like the first one.
It can't be true love.
You know what they say...
"The second is a pale copy
of the first."
Don't believe the hype!
The first is often a rough draft
for the second,
who is a rough draft for the third,
etc.
Yeah, well...
Doctor...
What if you're the rough draft?
What if existence were?
Imagine reaching a point in life
and realizing
the whole thing
has been one big rough draft.
We wipe the slate clean
and start a second life.
Eternal life.
Shall we dance?
With pleasure.
Shit, the Guillotins!
They came anyway.
Phew, they're gone.
Soup's back on!
Strange we haven't heard
from the others.
They must not have coverage.
Forget them.
Tomorrow, the beach!
You like Hector?
Aren't you afraid he's gay,
has a girlfriend, or is impotent?
When Charlotte introduced us,
right away I found him sexy.
He was pretty awkward,
which I find sexy.
So I followed him on the street.
After a few hours of tailing him,
<i>I approached him. Well, not really.</i>
<i>I was about to approach him, when...</i>
To test a guy, ask him
if he prefers Racine or Marivaux.
You'll know his outlook on love.
Watch this.
Excuse us.
Do you prefer Racine or Marivaux?
I'm more into Chekhov.
Chekhov...
Snow...
My sled!
How can I thank you?
Wanna take a ride?
The slope is too steep,
I don't dare.
Really?
Let's do it together.
On three.
One, two...
I love you...
I couldn't talk to him right away.
I liked him.
If I talked to him,
he'd think he didn't like me.
But I don't like him thinking...
"Be tactile."
"Find an excuse to get close."
I'm bushed!
Wanna take the wheel?
- I don't have a license.
- I'll show you, it's easy.
Shift into high gear!
Adjust the rearview mirror.
One eye behind you.
A third eye on the dashboard.
Your tachometer.
Your stigmometer. Be attentive.
Then you put the pedal
to the metal...
As hard as you can.
Left...
Right...
Left.
Windshield wipers?
The signal: left, right, up, down.
You're ready to roll.
The train?
Why not take the train?
The station, post office,
school and hospital are closed!
They'll have to take a private bus,
then a TGV!
Costs an arm and a leg.
If you back away from work
you end up in a blind spot!
Let's blow.
Hang on, please.
Could you loan us some money?
No more money in France.
Only bling.
How much you want?
A thousand euros?
A thousand each?
Relax, it's our kid.
Dressed as a bug.
New Kafka adaptation.
The costume comes with the book.
- Get to bed now, kid.
- I will not!
Wake up, people!
Mom says go to bed.
Don't make me punish you.
I will not go to bed! Wake up!
Can't you see
the whole country is fast asleep?
Wake up!
It's beddy-bye time for you!
It's just our little game
at bedtime.
Chloroform bullets.
It's time for you folks to leave.
Already?
Yep. It's an allegory of life.
Stay for a nightcap!
The sooner we go,
the sooner we find Truquette.
Looking for a girl?
Why didn't you say so?
Whiskey? Champagne?
- You ok?
- Dr. Afterbirth?
He's stuck, get a hammer!
- Got one!
- What're you doing?
Move your hands.
Harder!
You ok?
Should've told me
you're looking for a girl.
I've got a story for you.
Slide show!
Paf! A screen. That'll do.
Slides?
I was once looking for a girl too.
I remember it well.
Very well.
It was May 1968.
Thank you, Cohn-Bendit.
I was about to graduate.
I met the girl.
Slept over at her place.
Her name was Nathalie.
The most beautiful girl
I've ever met.
She lived near The Sorbonne.
The cops had secured the area.
No access to the Latin Quarter.
I went to my mother's to sleep.
We didn't have phones like today.
She thought I dumped her.
Took off with some other guy.
All because of the cops.
When I think of her now,
every May 1st,
Nathalie is a year further away.
All that remains is a tiny speck
at the back of my memory.
If you care about that girl, go.
I care the most.
Sometimes I wonder
if it's a lost cause.
We forgot the thousand euros!
Never mind.
A roadblock,
like in Afterbirth's story!
Hit the gas.
Hit the gas, go!
- Too late.
- Can't you help me?
I helped you
with your Greek goddess!
I'm an "out-of-law"!
Know what that means?
Ever been to a French prison?
It's hell!
Didn't you see "A Prophet"?
Hi. It's not our car.
Get out of that lemon.
Don't shoot, my head hurts!
I'm prone to migraines!
We're on our way to work.
Yeah, we've got tons of work!
We swear,
we're going home to work!
Cops are so corrupt these days.
There goes 100,000 euros
of public funding.
- And we've lost our wheels.
- Let's catch them.
Tune in to Fuzz Radio.
<i>Robbers disguised as cops...</i>
<i>All points bulletin...</i>
<i>These individuals are phonies.
I repeat, phonies.</i>
Set me free! I'm not one of them!
I'm anti-violence.
I'm not part of the comfortable,
violent middle class.
Revolutionary violence
won't solve today's problems.
Shit, another roadblock!
We've got this covered, guys.
Put your uniforms back on.
You can have the truants,
we'll take the car.
Seems fair.
The car's ours, we caught 'em.
You snooze you lose.
<i>This is the haul of my career.
Can't share.</i>
<i>This will save my marriage.</i>
<i>I arrest robbers
but my bank's on my ass.</i>
<i>Maybe the joke's on me.</i>
We've all got work to do.
Put your uniforms on.
Put them back on.
Are you allergic
to uniforms or what?
I'd rather dress in private.
Comrades! Victory is ours!
Comrade delinquents, wait!
This is a big victory!
Radical or no,
we're in the majority!
The biggest grassroots
demonstration ever!
A 350 km traffic jam
from Paris to Versailles!
No one has ever rallied
more protestors!
They're a gang!
Don't let 'em get away!
Aim for the brain!
Come back!
I'll trick 'em.
We give up!
We're out of ammunition!
What've you done?
Don't panic!
I used Dr. Afterbirth's
chloroform bullets.
They're just sleeping.
Get in the car!
Hurry up!
See where your Greek got us?
Now we're all on the run.
Hurry up, I'm late!
- See you later.
- Yeah, bye.
Gotta work!
Oh well, sea scum is pretty too.
So here we are!
Not bad.
Where is everyone?
Hope the others arrive soon.
Ok, here we go.
Let's go, old girl.
Cute bathing suit.
Not as cute as you.
Potato chips make me thirsty.
Where's some water?
There's plenty right there.
But you have to walk.
Cute. But I'm a champion swimmer.
Almost pro.
Check it out.
What?
- No, thanks.
- Go on!
You're as light and crispy
as a potato chip.
I'm trained in CPR too.
I can do mouth to mouth...
I see you've been eating.
I'm the lifeguard.
I'm responsible for you.
Wait 3 1/2 hours before swimming
or you risk hypothermia.
See you in 3 1/2 hours.
When I swim,
my muscles double in size.
Let's hang by my chair.
We get free drinks
and it's nice and peaceful.
I don't get it.
I've called 3 times. No answer.
Did they pick up
hot hitchhikers or what?
You mean Douchebag 2000
and his friend the bum?
Mind if I call him Douchebag 2000?
Just a sec, I gotta do something.
"Picked up
hot hitchhikers.
Charlotte"
Charlotte texted!
Incredible, look!
Just like you said!
They're busy with hot hitchhikers.
<i>Douchebag 2000 and the bum.
And my sister.</i>
The trouble with JoJo
was he was in love.
Love freaks me out.
Things were getting serious
between us.
I wasn't used to that.
So I gave him to a friend.
They've been in love ever since.
Sometimes I get jealous.
Then what?
There was a period when I believed
work was my sole salvation.
That was my mantra.
One night, my job,
which had become my lover,
said it was time to call it quits.
So I went home, and my boyfriend...
- the real one, not the lover -
was gone.
Guys? Are you listening?
Hello? Anybody home?
Look, a lion!
Hi! I deserted the Tour de France.
Got any clothes I can borrow?
Just this.
We're not cops, just the opposite.
I'll stay a lion, thanks anyway.
I'm with some gals from the Tour.
Wanna swim?
DRINK MORE WINE
We don't have time for this!
I love you...
I'm sure it wasn't a dream.
He said "I love you."
Must've been the wind in my hair.
Not too scared?
I don't think I could do it again.
In any case...
not alone.
Let's do it together.
Sure!
You're crazy, old girl.
Heart attack, guaranteed.
Then again,
it's a small price to pay for truth.
Forget it, I've got cold feet.
In that case
I'll go help the gravedigger.
There was an outbreak of cholera
and plague in the village.
Many bodies to bury.
See you later.
Wait...
I'll do one more.
I love you...
When life gets me down...
I disappear.
Too many disillusions.
Deserting is great.
Sometimes I feel like
I was born on the wrong planet.
I'm out of step here.
How to live?
I've only learned one thing
with age.
As time marches on...
I lose footing.
Hey you! Fruit picking forbidden!
Drop it!
What's this? Fishing forbidden!
You! Swimming forbidden!
No swimming!
And you! Bikinis forbidden!
Take it off!
Campfires forbidden! Put it out!
Move the car! Parking forbidden!
It's an ambulance zone!
Get moving! Summer's over!
Get back to work!
Lazybones!
Fascists!
I'll show you!
Car trouble.
Piece of shit!
Why didn't he loan us the new one?
Don't panic.
There's a junkyard nearby.
Better than nothing.
This time I'm through.
Sorry, I must go.
As you know, I'm also a carpenter.
I must rebuild the village.
It burnt to the ground last night.
Hey there.
What's wrong?
I'm sad.
Spring will soon be here.
The snow will melt.
No more sledding.
No...
Well...
You can always drown your sorrows
in alcohol.
Let's do one more run.
I love you...
My name is Marcello.
Marcello Sogni d'Oro.
Hello.
Hello.
We've come about a car.
We've come about a car.
Perfect. This is where it all ends.
Wanna get rid of your old car?
No.
She broke down.
She looks like this.
We don't do repairs, pal.
I've got too much work.
Summer's over. There was
a deadly pile-up on the freeway.
We're looking for a girl.
Why didn't you say so?
Give me your car.
Go get some grub.
When I'm done, I'll fetch you.
I raise my glass to friendship,
and to love.
Here, here! And to audacity.
We were raised
to be lighthouse keepers.
All we can do
is preserve our heritage.
Look at this shitty town.
A pile of old stones.
What can we do?
There's no future here.
It was at the inn
where we lunched.
The place reminded me
of a painting in the museum.
The shade cast by the begonias...
Mr. Wrecker?
Mister?
Mr. Wrecker?
Anybody here?
She's kaput! Dead! Finished!
At her age,
all I can give you is 50 euros.
What's that? Our car?
No.
It does look just like her.
- 1,000 euros.
- No can do.
500 euros.
- No can do either.
- So you're stuck here.
We could hock your ring.
Great idea!
No, it's a gift from an ex.
And we'd have to find a pawnbroker.
I'm a pawnbroker.
The ring...
The whole world is nothing
but makeshift repairs
on a sack of shit.
- Is that all?
- It's plastic.
It has high sentimental value.
We have business elsewhere.
Let's scrap this scrap yard.
Meet me at the snack bar!
What d'ya know? Julot!
- Sorry. You're here?
- Oh, hi.
Yeah, I'm here.
I worked all year,
like they asked me to.
I barely arrive, and paf!
Gotta go home.
Summer's over.
Summer's not over for a month.
They cancelled the last month.
Have you been on Mars?
The bankers bankrupted the country.
We gotta work
to jump start the economy.
What?
I've never been late
back to work.
This'll be no exception.
Gotta go. Only 30 minutes left
to enjoy the beach.
If I were you I'd do the same.
Quick, a beverage!
Smokes.
- Here on vacation?
- Yeah, you?
- Leaving tonight.
- Me too.
Wanna be my summer romance?
Let's dance.
Let's kiss.
Hey, Truquette!
Marcello!
How's it going?
I got a little gift for you.
How sweet!
It'll look great on you.
No, on your ankle.
It's sexier.
<i>A rival? Make her jealous.
Two can play at that game.</i>
Hang on. My name's not Patrick.
Oh, right.
I found it in the sand.
Truquette is an unusual name.
If you don't like it,
I've got others.
Roberto...
No thanks.
@&$Â§%!!
Truquette!
You forgot your flip book!
Lotion on back?
Brunette girl... your girlfriend?
No, but it's like chess.
Gotta stay several moves ahead.
Higher.
- Ice cream?
- Sure.
Here.
- Your flip book.
- Thanks.
I think your boyfriend
found a new girl.
Him? He's not my boyfriend.
He's not?
Look. He's the one I like.
I see.
Wonderful. You have a boyfriend.
So tell me...
What's he like?
We were on our way here.
We stopped at an inn.
I'll show you, follow me.
So he's not coming?
You can't stay sad like this.
I'm having an end-of-summer party.
Come!
I think I got sand in my eye.
It hurts.
- Can't see it.
- Blow!
Look. Don't you see anything?
Don't be mad at your Hector
for finding someone else.
It's only normal for the French
to cheat on their women.
Three presidents have proven that.
Follow their lead.
Take the bull by the horns!
I don't want to resemble
the president.
Crunchy. Delicious.
Very good.
See you after work?
Yeah, maybe.
See you tonight!
Maybe!
Hi there!
So, did you find the girl?
Get a move on!
I'm leaving it all behind.
Selling my belongings.
Cashing in my gas points!
Come on!
Get your butts in gear!
I'm leaving my wife, my kid,
my career! 58 years of life!
Off I go into the great unknown!
I had a check-up,
I've got 20 more years!
I told them
I was going out for cigarettes.
I quit 15 days ago!
They're still waiting!
France is about to go off
the deep end!
The airplane to freedom!
En route for a trip through time...
and space.
Same difference.
We're in need of a little luck.
BEACH 17 KM
Shit!
I'm out of change. What do we do?
Here.
Can't see a thing.
It's gone black again.
- Look!
- I'm looking, I'm looking.
What a rip-off.
Show me, show me.
My turn.
More money!
Can't see a thing.
- No sign of him.
- Let me see.
I'll get change. Got a 50?
No sign of him.
- Wait, let me see!
- Money! More change!
There he is! I see him!
Get in, quick!
Hit the gas!
We're gonna get my car back!
And Truquette!
Forward!
He's gonna get it!
Bertier! Bertier!
You owe us an explanation!
Where's Truquette?
Truquette took off
with some guy called Julot.
- My car!
- Not Julot!
In that case,
life's not worth living.
What're you doing?
- Spit it out!
- Get a new taste for life!
C'mon, this is no laughing matter!
Hey, easy!
It's a company car.
Take your suitcase out
and put it back gently.
That'll teach you.
If I'm late, they'll sue me.
That's it.
Get in.
Be warned,
I stick to the speed limits.
It's a company car.
Hey, my friends!
- Follow them!
- Calm down!
We're on the road to work.
I won't pull a U-turn.
Stay in the car or get out.
You can't have both.
- I'm outta here.
- Don't slam it!
I do what I like!
I've had it with that Truquette.
My suitcase!
- Come in!
- Hi.
I've got
a little housing problem tonight.
Fuck that. We gotta find Truquette.
Would you mind taking us in
for a few hours?
They're looking for the girl.
Looking for Bertier's friend?
- And my car.
- Brunette girl?
And my car.
Call her!
My briefcase!
Your stuff is in my briefcase.
Back at the beach.
It's your fault!
You made me hurry.
Quiet!
Brunette friend is with Marcello.
On scooter, near beach!
Marcello?
Who the hell is Marcello?
Some hunk with a car.
They're in Paris by now. Give it up.
Where's my car?
Brunette probably
at end-of-summer party.
Brass band will take you.
Let's go.
You stay put.
Maybe it wasn't them.
Maybe you're a victim
of your imagination.
Maybe you're bananas for his face.
Bananas? No.
Hey, Truquette! Having fun?
Some friends, leaving you behind!
That's life.
My friends are outside.
I swear that's her.
Not at all!
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's the 4th of August.
Heads will roll.
Just kidding.
It's a magic trick.
I found your brother's briefcase
on the beach.
He is your brother?
Don't forget you're taking me
to Paris.
Of course, don't worry.
<i>Feel free to resort to dirty tricks</i>
Would you like to try?
Slip your head in.
Go for it!
That's right.
The Terror wasn't all bad.
You ok?
Been better.
Truquette!
Truquette!
Can I get a kiss?
I'm not your type?
Who is your type?
I prefer men who look like...
my father.
What?
I'll show you a daddy!
Who's your daddy?
<i>Out on the waves,
Truquette thought of summer.</i>
<i>And the sun,</i>
<i>which was a question mark
on the horizon.</i>
<i>Pator saw a new horizon.</i>
<i>He felt a wind of liberty blowing.</i>
<i>Charlotte thought
of their wild summer.</i>
<i>She hoped to bask in it
her whole life long.</i>
<i>Hector thought of Truquette.</i>
<i>Heading out to sea,
bobbing on the waves of life.</i>
<i>Carried by the sea,</i>
<i>sailing into life.</i>
THE END
