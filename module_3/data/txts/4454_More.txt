Good evening and welcome to
Have I Got News For You.
I'm David Tennant.
In the news this week,
there's concern on the beach
in Newquay
as David Blunkett goes missing
on a surfing holiday.
At Westminster,
Labour MP Ben Bradshaw
explains the drawbacks
of having an office
directly below
the Scottish Nationalists.
Well, twice, I've had urine pouring
through from the upstairs gents
through my office ceiling
into my office.
And, at Stafford Prison,
after his wobbleboard
is confiscated,
Rolf Harris is unhappy
with the replacement.
On Ian's team tonight
is a ceramic artist
who's also on record as being
a supporter of the Labour Party.
Well, at three quid a pop,
who isn't these days?
Please welcome Grayson Perry.
APPLAUSE
And with Paul is a comedian
and host of BBC Two's search
for the country's best salon stylist
in a show called Hair.
Filming was chaotic,
as nobody did anything
until the director shouted "Cut!"
Please welcome Katherine Ryan.
APPLAUSE
So we start with the bigger stories
of the week.
Ian and Grayson,
take a look at this.
It's tax credits.
Oh, look, it's the Grayson Perry
Lookalike Competition.
I think these guys
gave it to George Osborne
with a statutory instrument.
The House Of Lords threw out
the Tax Credits Bill.
It's a triumph for the forces
of non-democracy.
The right result,
but a slightly strange set of means.
Indeed - it's the government's
historic defeat
in the House of Lords over
George Osborne's tax credit cuts.
It's a case of, like,
the wrong people doing
the right thing, isn't it?
Like, if white supremacists
had a bake sale for breast cancer.
You'd be like, "Well, OK..."
Who was particularly red in the face
about it?
Cameron, presumably?
I'm trying to think who was red in
the face, apart from George Osborne,
but he doesn't,
cos he hasn't got any blood.
Uh...
APPLAUSE
How was George reacting
on the night of the defeat?
What did he have to say for himself?
I think it was shock.
The House Of Lords is traditionally
there to vote down bills
put forward by the Labour Party.
Yes. And...
They suddenly got the wrong end
of the stick
and threw out a Tory bill,
so everyone's very cross.
And the Tories, you know,
they're going to...
They're going to team up with Corbyn
and abolish the House of Commons.
Uh, Lords!
I can't remember which it is, now.
It's that sort of
acute political analysis
that has made your name
on this programme.
On the night, though,
George did seem to get stuck
in a bit of a loop -
have a look at this.
Tonight, unelected Labour
and Liberal lords
have defeated a financial matter
passed by the elected
House of Commons,
and David Cameron and I are clear
that this raises constitutional
issues that need to be dealt with.
Will you take action against them,
to punish them?
Well, let's be clear,
unelected Labour and Liberal lords
have voted down a matter passed
by the elected House of Commons.
That raises constitutional issues
and David Cameron and I are clear
they will need to be dealt with.
Chancellor, you also said
this was your judgment
and it turned out to be wrong -
that's damaging for you, isn't it?
Well, let's be clear - Labour and
Liberal lords who are not elected
have voted against measures
in a Conservative budget
and that raises
constitutional issues.
There's a switch on his back.
Oh, if only...
How did he vary it, the next day,
when he had to defend what happened
in the Commons? What did he say?
Did he sing it? He said ...
Sorry, it's my mistake.
It's exactly the same thing.
Now, Osborne wasn't
the only one stuck on repeat.
His Cabinet colleagues spent
a lot of the week saying
he was in...
I wonder if that's as creepy
as all his other modes.
So, has this damaged George,
do you think? Yes.
Fatally?
One can only hope.
APPLAUSE
Yeah, the people who proposed
the most important motions
against the cuts
were Baroness Meacher,
Baroness Manzoor
and Baroness Hollis -
or, as the Daily Mail call them...
Which one was it took
the nuclear option?
It was Baroness Manzoor who tried
to pass the fatal motion.
Fatal motion - which is what did
for Elvis, I think.
It does serve them right
for creating all those peers.
There didn't used to be that many
and now there are 800 of them.
Yeah, to be fair, half of them
get burned down during the summer.
Can't stop that.
Can't stop that happening.
You'd think that,
given so many peerages,
the Tories would have a majority
at the House of Lords by now,
but they don't.
There have been veiled threats
that Cameron would flood
the House of Lords
with 100 new lords.
If you were Cameron, who would you
choose to parachute in there?
Jeremy Clarkson, that's who
they should put in. Oh.
That'd get rid of him off the telly,
wouldn't it?
AS JEREMY CLARKSON:
0-800 in 300 years.
He'd have a denim robe,
though, wouldn't he?
And following the votes,
there was an interesting discussion
between Baroness Meacher
and Michael Ellis MP.
It's worth seeing
if she was convinced
by anything that Michael Ellis
had to say - let's have a look.
..the House of Commons holds sway
over financial matters
is a crucial one to the functioning
of our constitution.
Otherwise, we have self-appointed
people in the House of Lords.
They have had that temptation
placed in their path
on dozens of occasions
over the last century.
They resisted that for 100 years -
tonight, they haven't.
It's wonderful
that they've got her down there,
translating for the hearing impaired.
In a bid to make sure this never
happens again, of course,
Lord Strathclyde has announced
he's going to do a rapid review
into curbing the House of Lords'
powers.
I'll give you a bonus point
if any of you can give me
the real name of Lord Strathclyde.
Bunty?
Is it one of those bonkers,
long names? Yes - he's called...
Another man of the people.
He has also got product placement
in the middle of his name.
You just can't trust the Tories.
Does he change his name
in wet weather?
Several of the papers identified
one clear super-villain in all this.
Who was that?
Well, apart from the obvious one?
Who's the obvious one?
LAUGHTER
Andrew Lloyd Webber.
Yes, mega-rich musical gargoyle,
Andrew Lloyd Webber.
APPLAUSE
Musical gargoyle!
He flew in from New York to vote
for the tax credits cuts.
It was his first vote
in over two years.
He's previously voted just 30 times
out of a possible 1,898
in 14 years. But he did deny
he had flown back specifically
for the vote. Does anyone know
why he says he was in town?
He was here for an opening
of one of his productions somewhere.
A new musical called Cuts.
APPLAUSE
He did say he was in town to watch
the revival of Cats, the musical.
Surely he's seen that already?
Or maybe he's just got a bad
♪ Memory... ♪
What Christmas treat
will millions of families
now be missing out on?
Their very own cut.
They were looking forward to it.
Christmas Day, open up the presents,
nothing there.
All your money gone.
A festive letter from George
telling them
what money they were going to
lose with the cuts.
Nothing says Christmas quite
like a letter from gorgeous George
letting you know
you're £1,300 worse off.
He's like Ebenezer Osborne.
He's a last-minute change of mind.
With tiny Tim Farron.
LAUGHTER
The Lib Dem genius.
With all the damage done to
George Osborne's reputation,
it's a good job Boris Johnson
didn't steal some of the limelight
with one of his ridiculous photo
opportunities.
LAUGHTER
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
At Prime Minister's Questions, then,
what was the big question
of the week for David Cameron?
Will the bill make people suffer,
basically.
And it was said by someone
called Karen, I think, or something.
Yes. They're always said by
somebody, aren't they, his questions?
He's like a sort of ventriloquist
dummy. "Are we going to suffer?"
AWKWARD LAUGHTER
"From this terrible bill?"
I can see an act.
And how many times did Jeremy feel
the need to ask this question?
Six. Hm.
So, he must have got a straight
answer one of those times, right?
No. Ah. The Prime Minister
didn't have a reply.
Well, you'd think
that's the big question
at Prime Minister's Question time
but, of course, it wasn't.
It was from the MP
Stephen Metcalfe who asked...
What was the other big story about
tax from the Commons this week?
Tampon tax.
SHE SIGHS
LAUGHTER
Tell us about that, Katherine.
Well, there's a 5% tax
on sanitary products
because they are considered
to be luxury items.
Now, while that does not affect me,
obviously, I do not use tampons.
I'm a single mother, not a king.
LAUGHTER
It's ridiculous. You are taking food
out of your children's mouths
to pay for tampons. You are,
literally, better off taking the food
out of their mouths and using that.
I've been using carrier bags, David.
I'm better off financially.
I thumbed two of those up there
before I came on the show.
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE
It's insane
that this should be taxed.
This is just dehumanising
to call it a luxury item.
There are no jokes.
People say period jokes for women.
There are not a lot of period jokes
for the same reason
that there are not a lot of
leukaemia jokes. It's too sad!
We've got a lot of period jokes
coming up. No!
We really do. Yes, it is the tampon
tax. The VAT on tampons has been
maintained because,
as Katherine said,
it's considered a luxury item,
unlike Jaffa Cakes,
which are exempt from VAT
because they are an essential.
There's your answer. Yep.
Shall we play a game of Luxury
Buys Or Basic Supplies? Yes!
Fingers on buzzers, team.
A luxury buy or basic supply -
a live kangaroo.
Well, it depends who's buying,
isn't it?
It's got to be a luxury...
For whom is it is an essential?
Well, for another kangaroo.
What are you going for?
Basic supply.
It's a luxury buy. Are you insane?
Of course it is.
Luxury buy or basic supply -
honeybees.
Bees? Or honey from bees?
No, honeybees.
You're actually buying them?
Yeah. I think that's a basic supply.
I think it's a luxury.
Leave them alone. Eat the honey.
I'm not trying bees. What are you
going for? Plants need them.
I'm going to take your first answer.
Are they basic?
It is a basic supply. Quite right.
Luxury buy or basic supply -
bumblebees.
Obviously, they're a luxury
because they've got fur.
That's it!
It's a bit like Versace, isn't it?
APPLAUSE
Yes, this is the shock news that
the House of Lords does, in fact,
serve a useful purpose.
LAUGHTER
As a result of the Lords' rebellion,
the Chancellor has been forced to
rewrite his Autumn Statement,
which now reads,
"Damn, shit and bollocks!"
Meanwhile, the Treasury survived
a rebellion over the so-called...
A relief for George Osborne,
who is going through
a tricky period at the moment.
Paul and Katherine,
take a look at this. Yep.
Oh, bad news.
Killer on the plate.
Yes, this is the bad news that...
What the what?! ..eating too many
sausages could lead to you exploding
like an atom bomb.
Eating sausages is as dangerous
as nuclear war.
Or is it plutonium? Strictly
speaking, it's plutonium, yes.
Plutonium?! It's a banned
substance now, the sausage. Oh!
It is not quite as dangerous
as eating plutonium, is it?
No. Unless Putin is serving.
I think MI5 will be
assassinating people
by giving them sausages and bacon.
KATHERINE: Meat cancer has
been all over the news. Yes.
And bacon is the worst offender.
So, it is a good day
for Jews and Muslims.
Yes, processed meat is now
in the top class
of five World Health Organization
classifications
for carcinogenic substances
harmful to humans. Right.
To put things in perspective,
eating processed meat increases
the risk of cancer by 18%. I think
plutonium is a little higher.
Will you have to change your diet,
now that this news has been leaked
to you?
Do you know,
I think I will just risk it.
Risk it for a brisket.
In fact, the World Health
Organization has tested over 940
substances and only one has been
found not to cause cancer.
Any idea what it was? Plutonium.
It is...
The Guardian went looking for
individual reactions to the news.
What did John and Bobbie
the butchers have to say?
"You've got to die
of something, ain't you?"
"Here we are, love."
They said...
The report went on...
The Daily Star interviewed
a very unusual group of people,
which included....
He obviously did not have a problem
with sausages.
Who, or what, might save us?
Vegetarianism.
Tomatoes. They're genetically
modifying tomatoes to kill cancer.
Is that right?
Absolutely right, yes.
According to scientists at the
John Innes Centre in Norwich...
You'll be as healthy as an alcoholic
if you eat these tomatoes.
There are foods that are medicine and
there are foods that are poison
and there is nothing in between.
But, right now, our poison to
medicine scale is off the charts.
We're just ingesting bacon and food
that's not food. And bread.
Don't get me started on bread, David.
You believe it's the devil, right?
I have never eaten bread.
Even when I was a child.
It looks like eating a napkin.
That's not food.
I mean, historically, it is food.
I mean, all those ducks
can't be wrong.
It's bad for ducks too.
It's quack cocaine.
APPLAUSE
Which other harmful foodstuff is the
government being urged to deal with?
Sugar. Sugar, yes.
A tax on sugar would cut down on
obesity, apparently.
But why won't David Cameron have
anything to do with a sugar tax?
Do the people who make sugar
contribute to the
Conservative Party in any way?
That is an appalling suggestion.
Lord Sugar. Yes.
The actual response from
the Government
is that if you put on a sugar tax,
unbelievably,
it will affect mostly the poorer
people in the country.
So, much better just to take their
credits away.
And then they won't buy
fizzy drinks and sugar.
So, they are caring.
In their own way. Yeah.
There was a man on the radio,
it was really funny,
and he was opposing the sugar tax.
He rang in, and he said
"The sugar tax is not going to work!
"Look at the carrier bag tax.
"That didn't work on me,
I just brought my own bags."
LAUGHTER
According to the Times...
He doesn't want to be SEEN to be
doing it. He draws the blinds.
What kind of damage is sugar doing
to people's lives in Somerset?
I think they have really good
lives in Somerset.
Well, they did until this happened.
They're being attacked
by sugar addicted ponies.
LAUGHTER
They've been dreading
this day for decades.
Have they got organised?
According to the Daily Telegraph...
Want to see how terrifying the horse
problem has become? Yeah!
LAUGHTER
Oh, my God! We can't live
in a country like this!
Calls for sugar tax have
intensified this week.
Sugar is causing problems
in Somerset,
where wild ponies are confronting
tourists
in an aggressive pursuit of sugary
confections.
According to the Mail...
Even worse, when the three other
horses erected a screen around her
and loaded a bolt gun.
According to the Daily Star,
scientists also claim that...
You know you've got a
serious problem
when you're desperately trying to
find an unused vein in your Stilton.
On we go to round two,
the Jigsaw of News.
Fingers on buzzers. Buzz when you
know what this is.
GRAYSON: It's Germaine... Oops.
BUZZER
Grayson. Germaine Greer.
She's got into a lot of trouble.
She's not allowed to speak
at some university
because of her views on the
trans-community. That's correct.
Germaine Greer has cancelled
a planned appearance at Cardiff
University after she was accused
of having misogynist views towards
transgender women. Yes.
She said, "Transgender women
can't be women,"
and she told Newsnight...
Makes you slightly less of a man.
LAUGHTER
But not a woman.
APPLAUSE
How's she gone about defending
herself? Does anyone know?
She was interviewed
on Newsnight, I think. She said...
And she used rather an interesting
analogy to prove her point.
Anyone know what that was? Yes.
She said, "If I put on a brown coat
and I grew my ears longer,
"it wouldn't make me a cocker
spaniel." Or something like that.
It's terrifyingly correct. Is it?
LAUGHTER
Pity she couldn't have chosen
some other dog.
LAUGHTER
What did transgender actor
Rebecca Root call Greer in response
to her comments?
Misogynistic? Er, a...
A glorified pantomime dame,
or something like that?
A pantomime baddie! Yes, that's it!
She called her ...
It's all getting
a bit ugly, sisters.
SMATTERING OF LAUGHTER
Come on.
LAUGHTER
Germaine Greer, a feminist,
who acknowledges the struggle
of women throughout the years,
just cos she hasn't experienced
the struggle of a transgender person
leading up to today,
she shouldn't discount it.
I think it's quite mean,
what she said. Awful, in fact.
But shouldn't she be allowed
to say something awful?
You should be allowed to say whatever
awful things you like.
In a university context,
isn't freedom of speech sort
of what universities are for?
You don't disagree with people,
you just shut them up?
That's not really a good idea,
is it? No.
A no-platform situation
is not the best one.
I think the students are entitled
to not turn up.
I wouldn't turn up if Bill Cosby
came to speak at my school.
And I want to learn about comedy,
but I'm not going.
Is he likely to be invited?
We're both banned
from my school at this point.
LAUGHTER
Yes, this is Germaine Greer's
latest cock up
that has given the transgender
community the willies,
which, frankly,
is the last thing they want.
Fingers on buzzers, teams,
here's another one for you.
Buzz when you know what this is.
BELL
Yes, Ian and Grayson?
This is... Apparently,
a 15-year-old from Northern Ireland
is meant to have hacked into
TalkTalk's computer
and got all people's personal details
and put them on the web.
Exactly. Four million customers of
the broadband and phone provider
TalkTalk.
Their details were allegedly stolen
by a teenage boy.
We're not allowed to reveal
HIS name.
He's yet to be convicted of a crime
and he is a minor.
Fortunately,
the Sun don't care about that
and they've named him
as "5ft tall BLEEP BLEEP".
With a name like that, he shouldn't
be hard to trace.
Just go round all the schools,
and when the register's called,
wait till you hear that noise
and you've got him.
I feel sorry for the IT guy.
He'll be like,
"It must have been China
or some North Koreans
"got through my firewall."
"No, it was a child." "Oh..."
The Daily Mail said he had
a single mum.
Oh, well, he's definitely guilty,
then.
On behalf of all single mums, I'm
just glad that our bastard children
are finally participating in
white-collar crime.
Who says there's no aspiration
in the world any more?
I know! It's felt like you have to
worry about your son,
knock on this door,
"You better be wanking in there
"and not bringing down
a corporation."
The two activities aren't mutually
exclusive...
And how quick were TalkTalk to
respond to their security breach?
They didn't tell anybody,
did they, for about a week,
something like that. I think
24 hours after they knew.
But, to be fair,
they were experiencing
a very high volume of calls
at that time.
This is the so-called...
..who allegedly carried out a
damaging cyber attack on TalkTalk.
The hooded teenager was arrested by
the police and, when questioned,
replied, "Yeah, whatever.
You're not my dad. Boring."
TalkTalk boss Dido Harding said they
will handle compensations claims
for their four million users on...
Bad news for loyal customer
Zachariah Zimmerman.
The 15-year-old boy who was arrested
is described as...
It makes you proud to be British.
In America, he'd have gunned down
half his school by now.
We've got to feel good about
ourselves where we can, haven't we?
Yeah, exactly.
Count our blessings. Absolutely.
There was a woman in America just
the other day
who was just shot by her dog.
Her dog!
He was a chocolate lab, so the police
were already all over it, but ...
LAUGHTER
Fingers on buzzers, teams.
Here's another one for you.
Who is it?
BUZZER
Yes! That's Paul and Katherine.
I refuse to recognise or remember
who this man is.
It's Tony Blair! He's sort of
partially apologised but not really.
I think this an attempt to sort of
get in before the verdict. Yes.
We do now know that the Chilcot
Report is expected to be published
June or July next year.
Six years we've been waiting.
Six years.
Longer than the entire
Second World War,
to come up with
the one sentence we want - "Guilty".
What did he specifically
apologise for?
He said he was sorry
that the intelligence
turned out not to be accurate. Yes.
Speaking in an interview with
American broadcaster CNN, he said...
That's not really fair, given that
he manipulated the evidence
to make sure it wasn't accurate.
So he didn't really apologise.
What has former weapons inspector
Hans Blix said about this
this week? Anyone hear this?
He accused Blair of misrepresenting
intelligence
about Iraq's WMD programme,
as you say.
When asked whether Blair had lied,
he said...
So, away from war and terrorism,
and onto salacious
relationship gossip. Lovely.
Who has Blair's ex-pal
Rupert Murdoch been enjoying
the company of recently?
BUZZER
Well, according to
Private Eye, it's Jerry Hall.
Is this correct?
We got it from the Sunday Times.
LAUGHTER
It was in the Sunday Times?
Yeah, I read the story
and I thought, "Is that true?"
I mean, honestly. Talk about out
of your league...Jerry.
Well, according to the Daily Mail...
..it says here.
But according to friends...
No, no ...
Ugh.
LAUGHTER
A lot of you have got
a picture in your head, haven't you?
So, to Labour leaders
and international relations,
what did Jeremy Corbyn say about
having dinner
with the Chinese President?
BELL
Yes, Ian? He said it was incredibly
boring. He did. He said...
This comes from the man who
photographs drain covers,
so that really was an insult.
What startling revelations did
the Sun uncover
about Jeremy Corbyn this week?
What are the stunning revelations?
Well, the Sun tracked down
Jeremy Corbyn's wife's niece,
who lived with him until recently,
who disclosed that he enjoys...
What a bastard.
And finally, another international
statesman revealed
something this week.
Who and what was that?
I think "international statesman"
is pushing it, but...
It's not Sepp Blatter?
It's Sepp Blatter. Ah! GRAYSON: Yes.
He shocked us all - not -
by saying that choosing Russia
to host the World Cup
was a forgone conclusion
before the actual vote. Hmm.
So it was rigged?
Yes, I know. Shocking, isn't it?
It is.
The Russians will be furious to find
out they didn't win it legitimately.
Putin will be angry as hell.
Yes, this is the news that
Tony Blair had sort of said
sorry for Iraq. During the
interview, Tony Blair added...
Mr Blair, no-one is doubting
your ability
to deceive people
on a massive scale.
Also this week,
Sepp Blatter revealed
that even before voting began,
it had already been decided
that Russian would host
the 2018 World Cup,
but he denied this was doing Russia
any favours as they would lose
in the final, 3-2, to Germany.
After the English bid to host the
2018 World Cup finals
received only one vote,
Sepp Blatter declared that...
No, we're not... Really, Sepp...
Sorry.
We're brilliant at it. Yeah!
That's what - that's the same joke.
Oh, is it? Sorry!
It's good, though.
APPLAUSE
We'll go back -
we'll do it again,
you can read the last bit.
Actually, Sepp...
LAUGHTER
Hang on...
If you look at their record
since 1966,
I think you'll find that England are
very good at losing.
Very good!
Which means,
at the end of this round...
it's four points to Ian
and three points to Paul.
Time now for the Odd One Out Round.
It's just one between you this week.
Your four are...
Charlotte Proudman,
the Dalai Lama,
James Bond
and air conditioning.
BELL RINGS
GRAYSON: Is it something
to do with sexism?
Charlotte Proudman has been
the victim of sexism on LinkedIn.
Right.
And all the others have been accused
of sexism.
I think air conditioning
was recently outed as a sexist...
Ah, yes. Yes.
..because it favours
the male metabolism.
I don't know about the Dalai Lama,
but James Bond is practically
a synonym for sexism.
It's a full, frank and fundamentally
100% correct answer.
Yes.
APPLAUSE
Proudman sparked a media storm
when she accused a fellow lawyer
of being sexist for
commenting on her photo
on the professional online
platform LinkedIn.
Also, Charlotte Proudman has stolen
her hairstyle from someone...
No, I've got...
LAUGHTER
I've got this hair registered.
Ian, I think you'll find
the Dalai Lama
has pulled off a similar...
APPLAUSE
Daniel Craig recently called
James Bond a misogynist.
He's "a bit" of a misogynist
in the way that Oscar Pistorius
is "a bit" lucky he wasn't black.
Just a bit...
This much.
How has the latest instalment of
Bond, Spectre,
attracted criticism for its
apparently sexist attitude?
Is it because the lady in it
is an older woman,
but Daniel Craig said she's not
"older", she's just Bond's age?
Monica Bellucci... Yeah. ..is 51 -
the oldest Bond girl yet,
which was hailed as a revolutionary
portrayal of women in the franchise,
but she appears on-screen for just
seven minutes,
in which time he manages to
meet her, sleep with her
and extract the information
he needs.
Was that all one swift movement?
Air conditioning has been accused
of being sexist
for being set at too cold
a temperature
for female office workers.
There is of course a simpler way
of making women feel warmer
in the office -
just double glaze
that glass ceiling.
Yeah.
And the Dalai Lama
has outraged feminists
by saying that any potential female
successor to his role
would need to be
very, very attractive.
Some Tibetan Buddhist priest believe
that in the moment of his death,
the reincarnated Dalai Lama enters
the body of a small child.
Whereas some Catholic priests think,
"Why wait?"
Time now for the
Missing Words Round,
which this week features
as its guest publication...
Subscribe now - no strings.
We start with...
GRAYSON: Er, my wife
is not a kite fan,
but she likes to give mine
a good pull
and tolerates a bit of wind.
APPLAUSE
Next...
GRAYSON: Smoking while there's
children in the Millennium Falcon.
Chewbacca arrested for...
What?! Yes, this is the news
that a man dressed as Chewbacca
was campaigning for a candidate
called Darth Vader
in a Ukraine election.
Fair enough with
Putin on the doorstep -
a vote for Darth Vader
is a vote for peace.
Here he is being
carted off by police.
And here he is in court.
He looks like he's been roughed up
since he was put into that car.
Yeah.
Next...
Is it allergy to wedding cake?
Is it Twitter?
It's Michael Gove.
Ruined by Michael Gove?! Yeah.
What, has he dug him up?
Is he a time traveller? Look who
I'm asking - is he a time traveller?
In a way. In a way?
Renowned Henry VIII
impersonator Mike Farley
has seen his work
opportunities dwindle
after the Tudors were slashed from
the national curriculum.
Explaining the appeal
to schoolkids of the Tudors,
Mike said...
But they can get all that stuff
online now, Mike.
Next...
KATHERINE: The Pope has a good job
but he doesn't get to internet date -
or does he?
The Pope has a good job
but he doesn't get to take time
off or fly a kite or stuff a ferret.
GRAYSON: He doesn't get to wear
trousers or culottes.
Yes.
LAUGHS: Culottes!
It must be all of those.
All of which answers are more
plausible than the actual truth,
which is...
A show?!
..according to Rod Stewart,
who expressed these views this
week in an interview with the Sun.
Rod, do you know
nothing about Catholicism?
The Pope has wine DURING the show.
And finally...
Was a popular euphemism.
For what?
Invading Crete.
Creek? Crete. Oh.
Oh, sorry.
You were on a beaver theme.
I thought you were calling sex
"Invading the creek", and I...
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE
I...
..loved that.
I loved that.
Well, we can do a retake
if you like.
It's a more interesting answer
than the rather obvious...
Parachuting beavers
killed 15 civilians in the 1940s.
Were they trained by MI5?
Yeah, but you can't direct
the parachuting beaver.
Once he's out there, he's out there.
Good for all those
German dams, though.
GRAYSON: Ooh, fair enough.
Parachuting beavers
imitated Churchill.
AS CHURCHILL:
We are parachuting beavers.
Parachuting beavers...
Oh, no.
An historian in
the US state of Idaho
has unearthed a video of the great
beaver trip of 1948 -
a relocation plan for
the state's beavers.
Here it is.
Now into the air and down they swing.
Box open and a most unusual
and novel trip ends for Mr Beaver.
What?!
How can it be cheaper
to drop them from planes
rather than just take them in a car,
"There you are."
"I'm not flying easyJet again,
thanks very much.
"Where the hell am I?"
What happens if the box doesn't open
when they hit the ground, as well?
GRAYSON: They're beavers!
APPLAUSE
So, at the end of the quiz,
the final scores are...
Paul and Katherine have five,
but the winners are
Ian and Grayson with six.
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
On which note we say thank you to
our panellists,
Ian Hislop and Grayson Perry,
Paul Merton and Katherine Ryan -
and I leave you with the news
that as George Osborne begins
to look vulnerable,
leadership rival Boris Johnson
plans his next move.
In Zurich, Sepp Blatter
explains how,
despite being President of Fifa,
evidence of corruption
never reached him.
And CCTV captures the moment
just before Prince Philip
finally loses it with the Queen.
Goodnight.
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
