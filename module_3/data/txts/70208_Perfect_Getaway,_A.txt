It's a long story behind ...
All my insecurities ...

And they took me to the service

And certainly do not want to talk about it.

My brother beat me

This place is reached on foot or by kayak,
That's what makes it so special.
It's beautiful.
How many days do you want?
One day staying, one on the beach

Typical error.
Will I need more?
It's what you need but

It's Hawaii.
Just because we're in Hawaii

- Aloha.
- How far can they go?
- Beach Dumahi.
Dumahi, Dumahi ... I think not

It's 10 miles as the crow flies,
not this way ...
On the trail to the beach,
Do you know this path?
Yeah, the great path?
Yes, but ... not going that far.
And how far they go?
Not until the end of this road,
so ...
If they stay here for about 5 minutes,
I'm sure someone will be y. ..
We have been here an hour
and nobody has stopped ...
Maybe more.
Shit, I thought
we were in Hawaii.
Come on.
- Are you married?
- Yes, yes, we just get married.
Look, some of these pictures

Are with those disposable cameras.

And decided to get married.

but they are pretty nice ...
The radishes and stuff.
Oh, yes, weird.
I think it's great

If, as to frame it.
You know what? we're going to bring.
Miles y. ..
We're coming.
Maybe for the next.
Come on, Kale, do not be so.
Baby, come on.
Guys, do not make much fuss

I think we handle it very well.
Kalalau Trail,
11 miles
We will go along that path.
How to pull this? these new things
have too many buttons for me.
Yes, I like to buy the best.
In fact it was today that I read the manual.
- What was that?
- Thanks.
Well.
I guess nobody saw it.
Really?
We show you, never fear.
Do you think the rest disappeared?
Look at me.
Do not forget to look down
and move fast.
Keep off green rocks.
That's it.
Well, that seems easy.
Yes, because he has all the equipment
camping in his back.
Well.
- Go get him, baby.
- Okay, okay.
Oh, my God.
- Done.
- Thanks.
You did very well.
Come on, baby, you can.
Impressive.
- That fear.
- Come here, come here.
Are you okay?

Hey, what's your name?
Have we already know? when
I saw I had a little Deja Vu.

- No, no.
I've seen on television.
No, not true.
In fact, fifteen is a screenwriter.
After all, the major studios
want to shoot their projects.
I smelled your fame and fortune.
So writer scripts?
You could simply say "writer."
Any film that I know?
In fact ... my ... first script is
In pre-production right now ...
So I must leave this
Same time the next year.
Who acts?
I'm still deciding,
They are making the selection of players.
Nic Cage is putting money
in my script.
Have a dramatic turn?
Yes, yes.
"And you're
in this business, Nic?
Me? not only spend a few courses,
one of these camps in literature.
I had so many unusual experience
In my life I thought about ...
Everything on paper and translate it
earn a million dollars.
But it is not so easy, why not?
But I liked a lot.
In fact I'm writing a few pages.
Essentially there are three acts, a trip
and people at risk ...
At risk?
Simply include a character
to attack the view ...
It is a heroine, a heroine.
I'm pretty sure
at risk.
Then these halfway
of fame, do not you, Cliff?
- Something like that.
- Impressive.
Yes, a great team ready
in Vancouver ...
Preparing the scenery and stuff.
But they are there
and you here.
Yes, yes, it is difficult to explain, but
brought to another to ...
make a new version quickly.
- A new story?
- If a function of just two weeks.
- It's commonplace.
- What does all was that?
Nine weeks.
Well, that's good fucking,
Is your vision, Cliff, your creature.
Do not let them get away with that.
He has never defended agents and
or anything like that.
The other day I said to Cliff that ...
What I like is about me,
but we can do something else for a while.
Well, here's another little tip.
Find yourself a new agent and
Find yourself a new story.
To you too.
I have one.
Wait a minute, listen.
This has the worst reception of the world.
Did you hear about what happened in Bahu?
What? What happened?
My dad called. reception
is a mess here ...
But he said something about bandits.
Is welcome.
- Is that it?
- It comes and goes. hardly any.
Is it in Honolulu?
Pope wants us to go. I
you are overreacting.
This in the news, kill others.
Well, that's terrible.
We spent the day before yesterday.
We like five months
and a half planning this.
Does not even know that was
on another island?
What ... that ... your dad told you?
You know who did it? You know what?
No, says looking for two people,
a man and a woman. and that's all.
Is she like that movie, right?
Murderers Natos
That movie scares me.
- Do you remember?
- Vaguely.
What do you think?
Well, we're here.
Speak now or forever.
Continuing, it is our honeymoon, no.
We're here.
Be careful.
The hard part is to come.
Yes?
Is the path to the falls?
I read in the guide.
It is only during the day I

How far is
It's like anything in life,
how far we have to be.
Nene, sounds so romantic.
Yes, I want to go to the beach, but ...
- How much? "A mile?
- Come on.
Maybe we should leave the man.
Do not worry about me,
It's easy enough to return.
- What?
- Nothing.
"Only a mile?
Yes! Just got!
Hey, wait.
Go!
Well, I think with the

Look at that.
I can not believe it's true.
Cristina.
Do you know?
She as crazy as me.

Are they a couple?
Will you go or what?
Baby, let's go.
Yes, but let me see if reception here.

We are newlyweds.
Ms. Gine Scribes.

Here we go.
It just honeymoon in Honolulu.
... Bahu Island, possibly
on their honeymoon.
teeth removed
and fingerprints.
There is reason to believe that the
murderers may have happened ...
the island of Kalalau.
- Are you kidding?
- No, these girls told us on the path.
Do you see?
Do you know who are the murderers?
I think not.
Security cameras showed
photos of the suspects.
I heard that several people die
above annually.
They stand under the waterfall
the falling stone strikes a ...
Or simply slip,
roll down and disappear.
Bad, right?
Could be worse.
How are you going?
I'm fine.
Two accidents in one day,
What for you is natural, right?
We're being followed, Kale
The point is that we cheated
Every man has a share
lie in his life.
I just thought we were
foolish enough to believe you.
- Sorry, I ...
- What did you think?
Just for how we see,
What did you think we are?
- Outlaws?
- No, do not judge.
Wherever I go, the world
I spits in the face.
Excuse me.
What?
I thought they said they would
Dumahi beach.
We said we were going to that area.
They said they would come by the
path, so ...
You either.
Look, I offered to bring them.
did not want, did not accept.
So I do not understand what the problem.
Kale.
Is this all in harmony here?
I think we're okay.
Impressive.
- How far are you going?
- Bahu Island.
- Do you?
- On the beach next door ...
- What is his name?
- Hanakapai.
At that or maybe farther.
Need permits to go further.
You should give us a ride.
Come on.
So after spending 45
taxi dollars ...
went to the hotel overlooking the sea.
- Sounds good.
The problem is that in reality
no sea view.
And David said to me:
* This is great *.
- Is everything all right?
- Yes, use the time.
- Yes, but these two are who I think?
- If, say they will go down the path.
- Shit.
- It's 1:30. let's go.
Honey, can you remove this?
I do not know.
- Agreed.
- Thanks.
Would you mind if we were
with you?
We're all going the same route.
On my right.
Yes, of course.
"You took the permit?
No.
I put in this pocket.
You lost it?
No, I'm pretty sure ...
no, I'm sure ...
Crap.
Ernesto Padilla
probation officer
Hurry, Cliff.
If a second.
We leave no man behind
in the hard part.
"Here no one is lost, no?
Did you know that Cliff is
a major writer?
Do you write for the movies?
! go that well!
It is preparing to
a new history.
She can not tell you anything, even
had heard of Honolulu.
- Now you be careful.
- What?
You know why.
Maybe Cliff can change the names
to protect the guilty.
- Do you do it in the movies?
- Do you know Johnny Depp?
Do you know Nic Cage
Do we imagine working together?
- Do you know Nic Cage?
- Yes, I know.
I prefer Johnny Depp,
is a dream.
You know that part of living here?
My God! dear all
begins with the story.
- Is not that right, Cliff?
- Yes.
I once made a surprise visit to
palace of a dictator in the river Tigris.
They had finished evacuating,
still smelled of cigars.
It was very difficult to find a villager
to say who had done that.
But in the master bathroom, which by the way,
is the hallmark of Ethiopia, ...
There was a box built to the ground.
We started to hit
the damn lock.
Were you in Iraq?
Yes, yes, my team and myself.
What you saw those fucking
photos, it was after.
What I'm saying
Now it's true.
They should be talking about it.
So I thought inside the box
open money ...
Perhaps some guns, ...
Or maybe some presidential grave.
Finally we opened.
We made it explode.
"Mortal, no?
Do you like the details,
not, Cliff?
Maybe you can make another peliculón.
- And we find when we opened it?
- What was found?
Avengers, the guy was a phenomenon.
And you know what she had,
in his personal reserve?
No, Nic, I was not there.
It is material for a job.
Mr. President had a predilection
by Francophones, small and large.
I tell you.
You were special forces?
Infantry troops
assault, what?
Officially only allows me to
say I am officially ...
Acting on stage tactics
of certain missions ...
And I went crazy.
And unofficially?
I'm a fucking American Jedi.
By the way, is a possible title.
You see this?
A fragment of a mine
mines.
I enter through the back
my fucking head.
Return, I reconstructed the skull
with titanium.
I can not pass through a detector
without sounding metal, but okay ...
It allows me to travel with Guilligan
without noticing.
"Guilligan?
My companion.
Now that sounds.
But listen.
When I enter this drill,
not even felt it.
So, I felt the impact and that I
licked his back, but no pain.
I would have stayed with that put
there, but I had this.
My colleagues swear that I
17 minutes walk ...
Before I was forced to lie.
And even after that I could go
by my own feet.
All in the mind, Cliff.
Remember that when writing
a scene.
Yes, very good details on that.
He is really very hard to kill.
Hey, you get to the beach?
Sure, continuous.
- Hey, I see that you did.
- Yes.
- Are there some three miles to the beach?
- Yes, but the path is complicated.
Hey, the more we move,
less people are in the path.
What do you mean?
See you back there,
pretend that you have to urinate.
Well.
Police made public this photo
of the murderers.
Apparently unaware that
were being filmed.
- Shit.
- What?
It could be anyone.
Are you sure?
Does not it look familiar?
Are you okay?
We are in the bathroom.
You're scaring me.
It can be anyone.
We know these people
addition to their stories ...
That, besides, I begin to seem
increasingly lie.
The next thing we'll hear what
he has the heart of a baboon.
Just try to impress
write a movie ...
About his life or something.
What do we know?
She is from Savannah, the son of
a military driver ...
She revealed, met Nic Carolina
south, but it reminded ...
Too much to his dad, he chased
and convinced her to move in with him ...
Of course I became interested in it;
is the first time you are in Hawaii ...
They thought about going to Las Vegas, but
They loved this because it is quiet.
But there were also in Bahu.
If.
Cliff is an interesting guy.
Yes, this is the first man who wants
talk while in the bathroom.
What is going on there?
Shake that bush to learn
they are there.
Shake that bush.
Warning: danger of flooding.
We're supposed to in our
honeymoon ...
So control your brain overexcited
because I want to have fun.
Nene, we will be fine.
I guess we'll be there tomorrow.
I hope so.
- Shit.
- You do very well, baby.
Wow, amazing.
If.
Well, we have macaroni and cheese
with genuine imitation cheese.
Honey, that are mashed vegetables.
Reflexes.
going for a walk.
What?
What do you do?
What do you mean by that?
That they are watching?
Whatever you're looking at.
It was probably only a goat,
There are many in this valley.
I have not seen any goat.
I hope you do not, Cliff.
Your awareness of the situation
is rather poor.
You're a writer, I am a Jedi.
It is clearly not beyond me.
Kill yourself ...
Or just drown you?
- I just wonder.
- No, I'm fine.
I do not know if offended or not, determines
"situational awareness".
What is the first thing you do
when you get on a plane?
Maybe take a good champagne, eh?
Do you travel first class, no?
I go on, like everyone else.
Well, when I take a plane,
I look at everything.
I look at the doors.
I count the steps until Entries
which gave access to my seat.
If the plane loses power during
take-off, ...
I find the way in
darkness, blindly.
And I know that the door opens to
inward, not outward.
And I know all this in 30 seconds
even before ...
Uncork the bottle for you ...
first class.
Look, if you wait until there is a
emergency to decide what to do ...
You are dead.
- But it never passes.
- It happened in City Sue.
- Sue City?
- DC 10.
He took four rounds when he landed.
He finished in a cornfield.
112 people died.
If I remember it said
on television.
Yes, I saw it from within.
The really is hard to kill.
Come on.
Hey, are you gonna do with that?
The food.
- Come on.
- I'd love to, but thanks.
Kitty, kitty going.
Excuse me?
No problem. if you want to stay
in the kitchen with the women, do it.
Hey, I'm an adult, so that
call me kitten ...
It has no effect.
You know? I step through the mind ...
What happened to you my mind that
we, Gina and I ...
Those who ...
Okay, Cliff, your mind of screenwriter
works too, ...
He sees ghosts in every corner.
What? the murderers
The fellow travelers.
- Another possible title.
- I think your mind plays tricks on you.
So you think it's a coincidence
we were in Bahu?
Sidney and I were there.
There were many people in Bahu
when the murders occurred.
So I see it, Nic.
Well.
Well, you've tangled rotation amount
dramatic second act.
Are not we chasing goats, do you?
No.
Would you mind telling me
hell are we doing here?
Someone is doing shadow
two people.
I do not know if they are hostile, but
if they come to our camp ...
We'll take care of them.
Are here.
I know, you did not see.
- "People of the excursions?
- No, someone else.
- We must return.
- Gine knows care.
He spoke of Sydney.
Gine can also look after her.
Are you fucking, Nic?
If I were the murderer,
I would not expect ...
kill here.
Wait.
Please, the guys are happy.
It also gives us much time together.
Oh, no, not my thing.
What is yours?
I still have not heard.
It might seem very boring.
Try me.
Well, we have been striving
much for me to get pregnant.
We will have five children,
two males and three females, ...
Of course
extremely beautiful.
We want to buy a house ...
Long walks in
summer with children ...
And be ourselves,
a family.
I guess I would be happy with that
Mama call me ...
And Mrs. Sidney Anderson.
There was a preacher in Georgia ...
What I told the boys
that would burn in Hell ...
For having extramarital sex
and then one day ...
found him facing the wall
house with a prostitute.
a prostitute
very large penis.
if, then ...
I learned a long time
how perfect that men are.
Do not believe them.
Nic.
He also lied about having had
a life of dreams.
My parents began to lie
hair and parted.
They decided that each could
stay with two children, ...
But the problem was that
had five children.
I was frustrated time
and frightened, ...
Until I met a boy
named Rockie, a few years older.
And everyone in the neighborhood thought
he was a good girl ...
But I saw something different,
risky and hooking me.
Great, tell me that girl
has not had one like that.
That's right.
He came knocking at my door.
Yes, I know men and Rockie.
One night I get on the lake.
It was warm and raining ...
And I was under the
wished it were that
what we had gone there.
I remember how it sounded seat
when you lean back, ...
The patience with me
caressed her legs.
Do not bother me, and what to
with your fingers much less.
Suddenly, I had it in my hand.
You are about to to come and
I also first
And then pee lighthouse
And I was out of the car
To go to look at something
in a pile of leaves
Y. .. was the farmer's neighbor
And still had ... still had
her necklace in the neck
He had been hanging from a tree,
He said he would kill me
if she told anyone
"Have you told anyone?
Yes, now.
Jesus!
You know? I find it incredible
how people talk about herself
while on holiday
They talk to people
they just met.
If.
If.
Hey you're doing?
Me.
What do you do?
I thought that was you but
then confused me.
What are you doing here? Why do
we follow? And who is this woman?

- What are you doing here?
- You promised, brother
In the store ok?
Did you come here for that?
It seemed that everything was fine
Okay, slowly
Where were you? Are you okay?
- Yes.
- Where was my boyfriend?
The last time I saw him was ...
I do not know, there
Look at that.
Yes, love, look at that.
- You want to help you, Cliff?
- I broke its neck
The body is clean
Love, you're a track man
How about putting your head there?
so that the blood runs down the hill
And not this way.
How about if you make sure
that this work be done?
- For me not to tell my

I found your
friends what do you tell them?
Can I see that thing?
Thanks
You see, pass the summer

They will want to get it all in the ass.

Or do not have to do that.
We packed our
things and leave.
It was pretty hard to get
here, we can not leave just like that
What do you suggest?
Alone missing 2 miles
to the beach right?
- Two miles rather long
- I know
But I think we have to try
Make keep talking,
To continue thinking that being the
star of a Hollywood film
Keeping them happy so that
all reach the beach alive
Rule number one game
Do not let them know that something
wrong you know?
Do you understand?
Only that is taking longer than ever
