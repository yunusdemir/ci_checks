<i>DAVID ATTENBOROUGH: The duels
between hunters and hunted</i>
<i>are as dramatic as any event
in the natural world.</i>
<i>The stakes could not be higher.</i>
<i>For both, it's a matter
of life and death.</i>
<i>Yet, surprisingly,
it's the hunters that usually fail.</i>
<i>To have any chance of survival,</i>
<i>predators must be perfectly tuned
to their own hunting arenas.</i>
<i>Every habitat brings
a different challenge.</i>
<i>This series will reveal,
as never before,</i>
<i>the extraordinary range of strategies
predators use to catch their prey.</i>
<i>But even for the most skilful,</i>
<i>success is never guaranteed.</i>

<i>ATTENBOROUGH:
A female leopard on the prowl.</i>
(BABOON CALLING OUT)
<i>Few predators instil more fear.</i>
<i>Yet out in the open,</i>
<i>she has little chance
of catching anything.</i>
<i>To succeed, she must get within
a few metres of her prey, undetected.</i>
<i>Her strategy is to use cover,</i>
<i>wearing it like a cloak of invisibility.</i>
<i>She's an expert in stealth.</i>
<i>Impala are her favourite prey.</i>
<i>This one is just out of her range.</i>
<i>She needs to get closer,
within four metres.</i>
<i>She only has a short burst of speed.</i>
<i>She must stay hidden
until she's in the strike zone.</i>
<i>But out of sight
doesn't mean out of mind.</i>
<i>Impala have acute hearing
and a superb sense of smell.</i>
(SNORTS)
<i>Now, the only prey she can see
is right out in the open.</i>
<i>But leopards are the most versatile
of all the big cats,</i>
<i>adept at finding cover
in the most unpromising places.</i>
<i>The steep walls of the gully
are now her cover for an ambush.</i>
<i>The male puku is close enough,
but he's too big to tackle.</i>
<i>She needs to slip past him
without being seen.</i>
<i>If he spots her, he'll blow her cover.</i>
<i>Slowly does it.</i>
<i>To succeed here, she needs to find prey
grazing close to the edge.</i>
<i>Or better still, in the gully itself.</i>
<i>Frustration.</i>
<i>Success would have staved off hunger
for a week.</i>
<i>But while there's prey around
there's hope.</i>
<i>Peeking over the top is a risk</i>
<i>but it's the quickest way
to find a new target.</i>
(SNORTS)
<i>A burst of speed of 40 mph, and
it's all over in less than six seconds.</i>
<i>Except it isn't.</i>
<i>Dazed and disorientated,
the impala makes a miraculous escape.</i>
<i>It's been the perfect stealth hunt,
and she's nothing to show for it.</i>
<i>But then, six out of seven leopard hunts
end in failure.</i>
<i>A leopard's hunting strategy
depends on finding cover.</i>
<i>But how do you catch your prey</i>
<i>in a place where there's literally
nowhere to hide?</i>
<i>That's the challenge facing
Zambia's wild dogs.</i>
(WHIMPERING)
<i>This close-knit pack
is made up of one adult female</i>
<i>and her 12 offspring from last year.</i>
<i>Unlike the solitary leopard,</i>
<i>wild dogs depend for their survival
on teamwork.</i>
<i>Dogs that play together, work together.</i>
<i>Each morning, the pack heads out across
the open plain, prospecting for prey.</i>
<i>Mother decides which direction they go.</i>
<i>The rest stay close.</i>
<i>They'll keep going for miles
until they find the right kind of prey.</i>
<i>Adult zebra are too big a challenge.</i>
<i>And the same goes for tsessebe.</i>
<i>An oribi is an easier target.</i>
<i>But is it worth the effort,</i>
<i>especially on an oribi
that's as fit and bouncy as this one?</i>
<i>Better to save their energy
for something bigger...</i>
<i>A wildebeest.</i>
<i>It's what they've been looking for.</i>
<i>The dogs need to make
the wildebeest run.</i>
<i>Their success will depend
on wearing him down in a long chase.</i>
<i>While the prey's running,
the dogs have the advantage.</i>
<i>But when the wildebeest stand
their ground, the tables are turned.</i>
<i>Faced with a wall of horns,
the pack is powerless.</i>
(PANTING)
<i>But not all the wildebeest
have had the courage to stop.</i>
<i>Now, the real contest begins.</i>
<i>The wildebeest are big and strong.</i>
<i>But the dogs have stamina.</i>
<i>Right now, hunters and hunted
are clocking 40 mph.</i>
<i>The pack can keep this pace up
for miles.</i>
<i>The wildebeest can't.</i>
<i>One wildebeest peels off,
then another two.</i>
<i>The split confuses
the inexperienced pack,</i>
<i>sending them in different directions.</i>
<i>The mother and one youngster
continue on.</i>
<i>The rest of the pack stop,
believing they have an easier target.</i>
(SNORTS)
(SNIFFS)
<i>It's a mistake.</i>
<i>Like a beast with two heads,
each but! protects the other? rear.</i>
<i>And the dogs can do nothing.</i>
<i>Ahead, the chase continues.</i>
<i>Another wildebeest peels off.</i>
<i>Now the mother
has just one in her sights.</i>
(SNORTS)
<i>But it'll mean nothing without the help
of the rest of the pack.</i>
<i>The situation here
has reached stalemate.</i>
<i>The young dogs have lost valuable time.</i>
<i>They must try and catch up
with their mother.</i>
(SNORTS)
<i>Back at the front,
the mother is beginning to tire.</i>
<i>And the wildebeest knows it...</i>
<i>Bouncing to show he's still strong
and not worth chasing.</i>
<i>But fresh, young legs
are catching up fast.</i>
<i>When one dog tires,</i>
<i>there's always another member
of the team to take up the lead.</i>
<i>The dogs now have the numbers
to bring the wildebeest down.</i>
<i>Each bite risks a broken jaw,</i>
<i>but going for the legs
is the only way to stop it.</i>
<i>And they must do so before
it reaches the safety of the herd,</i>
<i>a few hundred metres ahead.</i>
<i>After a 20-minute chase,
the bull 's energy is near spent.</i>
<i>This time there will be no sanctuary
within the herd.</i>
<i>The dogs' stamina has been rewarded.</i>
<i>All they must do now
is to bring their quarry to the ground.</i>
<i>Working as a pack allows wild dogs</i>
<i>to take on prey ten times heavier
than any one of them.</i>
<i>But many mouths need a lot of food.</i>
<i>The price they pay for these numbers</i>
<i>is knowing they'll have to attempt
the same thing again tomorrow,</i>
<i>and every day.</i>
<i>Teamwork and stamina
on Africa's open plains</i>
<i>have proved to be a winning combination.</i>
<i>But in the dense
and complex world of the jungle,</i>
<i>hunting is a never-ending game
of hide and seek.</i>
<i>Here, it pays to sit still</i>
<i>and blend in.</i>
<i>Because you just never know
who's watching.</i>
<i>The Parson's chameleon is an expert
in the "see-and-not-be-seen" game.</i>
<i>It lets its eyes do all the work.</i>
<i>While the rest of its body
moves in slow motion</i>
<i>so as not to scare possible targets.</i>
<i>The problem is that it can
only see prey if it moves.</i>
<i>So, is this a stick insect...</i>
<i>Or a stick?</i>
<i>Aha.</i>
<i>Time to unleash its secret weapon.</i>
<i>A tongue longer than its body.</i>
<i>The Parson's close cousin,
the Nasutum chameleon,</i>
<i>has the same weapon, but in miniature.</i>
<i>As small as a matchstick,
he needs to get much closer to its prey.</i>
<i>But even with eyes
as big as its stomach,</i>
<i>this isn't the meal deal
he was hoping for.</i>
<i>In the jungle,</i>
<i>it's hard finding the right-sized prey,
when you're a tiny predator.</i>
<i>Promising opportunities
can quickly tum to disappointment.</i>
<i>Spotting any kind of prey
in this dense green world is hard.</i>
<i>If you do find something,
you want to make sure it doesn't escape.</i>
<i>The praying mantis
has arms that can strike</i>
<i>ten times faster
than a blink of the eye.</i>
<i>And it's the only insect
known to see in 3D.</i>
<i>Perfect for judging strike distances.</i>
<i>But, like the chameleon,</i>
<i>her problem is seeing prey
when it freezes.</i>
<i>She needs some movement
to be sure it's food.</i>
<i>just the tiniest sign of life.</i>
<i>Yep, that's done it.</i>
<i>A lightning strike has given her
the edge over her insect prey,</i>
<i>but it doesn't pay to be complacent.</i>
<i>In the jungle arms race,</i>
<i>only too often there's someone else
with a more powerful weapon.</i>
<i>And there's one predator that has</i>
<i>perhaps the most ingenious answer
of all to the jungle's challenge.</i>
<i>It lives along rivers,
in the rainforests of Madagascar.</i>
<i>The insects it hunts
fly down the same jungle corridors.</i>
<i>But there's a problem.</i>
<i>It's a web-building spider.</i>
<i>So how does it get over the river
to hunt?</i>
<i>It's called Darwin's bark spider,</i>
<i>and the female
has a remarkable strategy.</i>
<i>Like a real-life Spider-Woman,</i>
<i>she sprays strands of silk
in one long, continuous flow.</i>
<i>The threads fan out like a sail</i>
<i>and drift on air currents
blowing across the water.</i>
<i>Every few seconds</i>
<i>she crimps the strands together
to stop them spreading too widely.</i>
<i>The breeze will do the rest,</i>
<i>blowing the threads into a single line,
and a 25-metre bridge.</i>
<i>Now, she must reinforce her bridge
because her web will hang from it.</i>
<i>But there's something bouncing the line
at the other end.</i>
<i>Another Darwin's spider is trying
to take advantage of her hard work.</i>
<i>She must deal with the intruder head-on.</i>
<i>The cut line is an inconvenience,
but no more than that.</i>
<i>With hooks on the tips of each leg,
she gathers in the thread.</i>
<i>It won't go to waste
as she'll eat it later.</i>
<i>When it's all reeled in,
she sprays again.</i>
<i>Out streams
another 25-metre bridging line.</i>
<i>How a spider,
no bigger than a thumbnail,</i>
<i>can produce so much silk so quickly
has baffled scientists.</i>
<i>And it's no ordinary silk.</i>
<i>It's the toughest natural fibre
on the planet.</i>
<i>Tougher than steel.</i>
<i>And it needs to be tough
to span the wide river.</i>
<i>With the bridge taut
and the ground anchor in place,</i>
<i>it's time to construct her trap.</i>
<i>These spiders can build the world's
largest orb webs up to two metres wide.</i>
<i>A few hours from
the first spray of bridging line,</i>
<i>the job is done.</i>
<i>Now her strategy is simple,</i>
<i>sit and wait.</i>
<i>And there's one final bout
of silk production,</i>
<i>shrink-wrapping her food for later.</i>
<i>Not all rivers provide their predators
with a steady supply of prey.</i>
<i>On the Grumeti River, in Tanzania,</i>
<i>lives the planet's
most patient predator.</i>
<i>A Nile crocodile.</i>
<i>Five metres long, 700 kilos...</i>
<i>And very hungry.</i>
<i>His last square meal
was nearly a year ago.</i>
<i>The river's other residents
aren't food...</i>
<i>just a distraction.</i>
<i>He is waiting for something bigger</i>
<i>from over the horizon.</i>
<i>But beyond the big area's
isolated river;</i>
<i>there's still no sign of the migratory
herds he depends on for survival.</i>
<i>Other smaller crocs are waiting, too,</i>
<i>but their meal ticket depends
on the hunting skills of the big guy.</i>
<i>The herds could be here in a week,
or a month.</i>
<i>In rare years, not at all.</i>
<i>Until then, the crocs
must conserve their energy.</i>
(SNORTS)
(SNORTS)
(PANTING)
(WILDEBEEST LOWING)
<i>Finally, the sound
they've all been waiting for.</i>
<i>The herds have arrived.</i>
<i>It's time for the crocs
to get into position.</i>
<i>All eyes will be on the big guy.</i>
<i>Only he has the power
to tackle a full-grown wildebeest.</i>
<i>The year-long wait is almost over.</i>
(GRUNTING)
<i>After months on the march,
the wildebeest are desperate to drink.</i>
<i>But experience has taught the adults
to be cautious.</i>
(SNORTING)
<i>The water is just too inviting for
a calf, unaware of the dangers within.</i>
(SNIFFS)
(SNORTING)
<i>But every wildebeest
must take its chances</i>
<i>and hope that its reflexes are faster</i>
<i>than what many know
lurks in the murky waters.</i>
(BUBBLING)
<i>just a harmless hippo.</i>
(GRUNTING)
<i>That was no hippo.</i>
<i>It's put the wildebeest more on edge.</i>
<i>But here, fear always
gives way to thirst.</i>
(GRUNTING)
<i>Catching the wildebeest
is all about timing.</i>
<i>The big croc's technique is rusty.</i>
<i>It's been a whole year
since his last hunt</i>
<i>and he's out of practice.</i>
<i>But this isn't the end of the drama,
just an intermission.</i>
<i>For the next two weeks,
waves of wildebeest</i>
<i>will pass through the Grumeti.</i>
<i>Time for the big croc to try
a different tactic.</i>
<i>The floating log.</i>
<i>He's hoping the wildebeest
won't notice him</i>
<i>until it's too late.</i>
(GROANS)
<i>Now, the smaller crocs move in.</i>
<i>The big croc will need their help
to tear off chunks.</i>
<i>Crocs can't chew
so they have to spin together</i>
<i>to tear pieces of the carcass.</i>
<i>Everyone gets their share
and it's all thanks to the big guy.</i>
<i>He won't feed again until
the wildebeest return next year.</i>
<i>Across the globe, millions of animals
are continuously on the move</i>
<i>in search of seasonal food.</i>
<i>But it's not just
prey animals that must migrate.</i>
<i>Some predators have to journey, too.</i>
<i>Amur falcons are one of the world's
greatest long-distance travellers.</i>
<i>As their prey dries up in
their breeding grounds in Siberia,</i>
<i>they embark on an epic migration
to Southern Africa,</i>
<i>crossing 14 countries, two continents
and one ocean.</i>
<i>Only here in this remote valley
in Northeast India, do they join forces.</i>
<i>A million falcons
and the greatest gathering</i>
<i>of birds of prey on the planet.</i>
<i>This valley is a vital pit stop
on the falcons' migration.</i>
<i>The tiny raptors can go no further
until they build up their fat reserves.</i>
<i>And they've timed
their arrival here perfectly.</i>
<i>For just a few weeks each year;</i>
<i>winged termites, alates,
leave the safety of their mounds</i>
<i>in millions.</i>
(CHIRPING)
<i>High in calories, these alates
are exactly what the falcons need</i>
<i>to fuel their oceanic crossing,</i>
<i>the longest made by any bird of prey.</i>
<i>Ta have any chance of surviving
their journey,</i>
<i>they must near! y double their weight
in just two weeks.</i>
<i>Those that make it to South Africa</i>
<i>will have to do the whole trip
back again in four months' time.</i>
<i>For Amur falcons, survival means flying
14,000 miles every year of their lives.</i>
<i>For some predators it's not the distance
they have to travel,</i>
<i>that's their greatest challenge,
but the size of their prey.</i>
<i>And few challenges come bigger
than the one in this ocean.</i>
<i>Each year, female humpback whales
journey from their feeding grounds</i>
<i>in Antarctica to Australia
to have their calves.</i>
<i>These calm, warm waters
are a perfect nursery.</i>
<i>Perfect, but for one thing.</i>
<i>Orcas, killer whales.</i>
<i>They appear just
as the migration begins.</i>
<i>And they're on the hunt for calves.</i>
<i>Highly intelligent orca are the ocean's
most successful predator.</i>
<i>When hunting, they can travel at 30 mph.</i>
<i>Twice as fast as a mother and calf.</i>
<i>The hunters close in silently.</i>
<i>It's only now that the mother realises
they've been followed.</i>
<i>The orca have the advantage of numbers
but they need to be cautious.</i>
<i>The mother's rear is protected
by a flve-metre-wide tail</i>
<i>that could slice through them.</i>
<i>Her flanks are defended by a pair of
long barnacle-covered flippers.</i>
<i>And in the middle is the calf.</i>
<i>Riding high on its mother's back
and out of reach.</i>
<i>To separate mother from calf,</i>
<i>the orca must use
all their intelligence.</i>
<i>They take it in turns to try
and wave-wash the baby</i>
<i>away from its mother.</i>
<i>In a month, the calf would be strong
enough to withstand the onslaught.</i>
<i>Not now.</i>
<i>But then, the tables are turned.</i>
<i>A male humpback arrives,
driving the orca away with its flippers.</i>
<i>And the situation worsens
when a second male appears.</i>
<i>Now, the pod face the power
of three 40-tonne whales,</i>
<i>and the escorts make their weight count.</i>
<i>The bubbles are like a smokescreen,
blocking the orcas' vision and sonar.</i>
<i>There's a real danger of being injured
by an unseen fluke or flipper.</i>
<i>With the escorts defending
both sides of the mother,</i>
<i>the killer whales
have been outmanoeuvred.</i>
<i>As the orca retreat,
the escorts drive home their advantage,</i>
<i>pushing the hunters further away.</i>
<i>It's an error of judgement.</i>
<i>With mother and calf unprotected,</i>
<i>the orca double back
before the humpbacks can react.</i>
<i>The killer whales separate the calf
from its mother.</i>
<i>They push the calf underwater
and drown it.</i>
<i>The intelligent hunters have turned
defeat into victory.</i>
<i>The orcas' prize is so large
that sharks are quick to take advantage.</i>
<i>Through intelligence,
stamina and team work,</i>
<i>the orca have mastered
the ocean's greatest challenge.</i>
<i>Yet even they fail as often
as they succeed.</i>
<i>Most predators fail most of the time.</i>
<i>It's what makes them the hardest-working
animals on the planet.</i>
<i>The pressure is even greater
when they have other mouths to feed.</i>
(YIPS)
<i>At eight months old, these cubs are
still totally dependent on their mother.</i>
<i>To support them, she must kill something
large, like a gazelle, nearly every day.</i>
<i>But these youngsters are proof
that she has overcome</i>
<i>the challenge of their habitat.</i>
<i>Few cheetah mothers get this far
with four cubs.</i>
<i>If the cubs are to survive without her,
they must watch their mother carefully</i>
<i>and learn the strategies for hunting
on the open plains.</i>
<i>There's a lot to take in.</i>
<i>They'll need to learn
that their top speed</i>
<i>can only be sustained for a few seconds.</i>
<i>They'll have to master how to match
the twisting turns of the prey,</i>
<i>so they get close enough to trip it.</i>
<i>And they will soon learn
the margin for error is tiny.</i>
<i>The odds are against them.</i>
<i>90% of cheetah cubs never make it
to their second birthday.</i>
<i>Even with this experienced mother,</i>
<i>the future for this family
is far from certain.</i>
<i>All any predator can do
is to keep on trying.</i>
<i>For The Hunt team, filming
a Nile crocodile capturing a wildebeest</i>
<i>would require the same skill, patience
and reactions as the five-metre reptile.</i>
<i>The timing of the shoot
would also be critical</i>
<i>since this behaviour only happens when
the crocs' river is at its lowest point.</i>
<i>But things get off to
the worst possible start.</i>
<i>The river, in flood,
in the middle of the dry season.</i>
What we hoped for
was that the Grumeti River
would be just a series of
pools full of crocodiles.
They're probably scattered
over 30 or 40 miles of river.
So we've got to wait for two things,
we've got to wait
for the crocs to bunch up and we've
got to wait for the wildebeest to come.
<i>ATTENBOROUGH: As well as Mark,
this small crew includes</i>
<i>son, jacca, and
camerawoman and wife, Vicky.</i>
CORDEY: Are you keeping watch?
(CHUCKLES) I am. I'm watching my son
and my husband
at very deep muddy river
with lots of crocodiles.
CORDEY: You could lose a large part
of your family here, couldn't you,
-if you're not careful?
-Yes.
Basically half of us could be wiped out.
These crocs hunt by stealth
and they can sneak up
in this dark, murky water
right to the edge of the bank.
So the golden rule of filming here is
to be one metre from the water.
<i>ATTENBOROUGH: Not to be outdone
by the floodwater,</i>
<i>the team sets up the first hide.</i>
<i>But any idea of filming
is soon swept away.</i>
Literally within half an hour, an hour,
I felt water around my ankles.
If I was still in that hide, then
he definitely wouldn't be on the bank.
We're not going to go in and get it,
the water, the colour it is,
and knowing that he's got friends around
who could be, literally,
just at the base there.
<i>ATTENBOROUGH: With a flooded river
and no wildebeest,</i>
<i>the wait was going to be longer
than expected.</i>
Crocs are used to being patient,
but now we've got to show
equal patience.
(ENGINE STARTING)
<i>ATTENBOROUGH: Leaving the raging river,</i>
<i>the team go in search of
the migrating wildebeest,</i>
<i>to see just how far they are
from the Grumeti.</i>
STONE: I think we should go over
the other side of the hill
and get a sense of the number.
<i>DEEBLE: Should be up here.
Do you want to take the controls?</i>
STONE: Yeah, I'll take controls.
<i>ATTENBOROUGH: It's some time
before they find the wildebeest</i>
<i>on the Serengeti 's vast plains.</i>
STONE: Loads, there.
DEEBLE: Loads.
STONE: Yep, spreading out, all across.
-Oh, <i>okay.</i>
- STONE: Fantastic.
<i>- How far</i> away <i>are we?
-70 miles away.</i>
<i>ATTENBOROUGH: Still a long way
from the Grumeti</i>
<i>but at least the wildebeest
were heading in the right direction.</i>
(IN DISTINCT TALKING)
DEEBLE: The wildebeest are
still a long way away,
but in the meantime we can
hopefully pick up
these intimate moments
with these really huge crocs.
<i>ATTENBOROUGH: Finding the biggest
and most dominant croc</i>
<i>would be key to the team's success.</i>
<i>Only the top croc would be powerful
enough to grab a wildebeest.</i>
<i>To find their star,</i>
<i>Mark and Vicky would need to look out
for territorial behaviour.</i>
Today it's sunny
and it's early in the morning.
I'm full of hope.
<i>ATTENBOROUGH: But at the end of the day
all Mark sees is one static croc.</i>
DEEBLE: He lay on the sandbank
all day for seven hours.
(EXHALES) Patience.
<i>ATTENBOROUGH: And Vicky
wasn't having much luck either.</i>
STONE: When we first found it
there were crocs all over the bank
over there,
and now I've been in here for
several hours and there's not one.
<i>ATTENBOROUGH: After a week,</i>
<i>Mark and Vicky are no closer
to finding their dominant croc.</i>
<i>But at least the news on the wildebeest
was more positive.</i>
34 miles, getting closer.
<i>ATTENBOROUGH: Back on the river,
it was like Groundhog Day.</i>
Crocs are all-or-nothing creatures,
and I'm afraid it's been
another day of nothing.
<i>ATTENBOROUGH: With no sign of action,
the hours of watching motionless crocs</i>
<i>were beginning to take their toll.</i>
It's like watching paint dry.
Well, that was useless,
(EXHALES) utterly useless.
The crocs just didn't come.
<i>ATTENBOROUGH: The team needed
something to change,</i>
<i>and the falling water
seemed a good omen.</i>
DEEBLE: This is what the floodwater's
left us, the lower jaw of a croc.
Look at that, it's heavy.
This has come from a croc
who must be at least five metres.
And they're down there.
Don't step too close
to the water, sweetheart.
<i>(BOTH CHUCKLE)</i>
STONE: I got too excited by the jaw!
<i>ATTENBOROUGH:
And with the water dropping,</i>
<i>excitement was finally rising
among the crocs.</i>
DEEBLE: Well, that felt so different
this morning.
It really felt like
there was an energy there
that hasn't been there for weeks.
<i>ATTENBOROUGH: And it isn't long before
the team find their dominant croc.</i>
The big territorial male
who we hope will do most of the hunting
has been very active this morning.
He's been displaying
and really patrolling this stretch.
<i>ATTENBOROUGH:
With a big croc to focus on,</i>
<i>all they needed now were the wildebeest.</i>
<i>Mark and Vicky take to the skies
to check on their progress.</i>
<i>STONE: Look, right as far
as you can see,</i>
<i>the crocs might' actually get a meal.</i>
<i>- That's great, Vick.
-(CHUCKLES)</i>
<i>ATTENBOROUGH:
The wildebeest were, at last,</i>
<i>less than a day away from the Grumeti.</i>
<i>Mark and Vicky take up positions
on either side of the river.</i>
(WHISPERING) We can see wildebeest
just trying to come down
but they are just so nervous.
<i>ATTENBOROUGH: After such a long wait,
it's a tense time.</i>
<i>Success for crew and croc
will depend on split-second reactions.</i>
<i>For the big croc,
the first session ends in failure.</i>
DEEBLE: It's very easy to have empathy
for the animals that are being hunted,
but I have to say that in this instance,
my sympathies are all with the crocs.
We've just seen how over the past month
they've had nothing to eat at all,
and that's been what they've experienced
for the last year.
<i>ATTENBOROUGH: And it's a few days
before the wildebeest return.</i>
(WHISPERING) It's 12:00,
very hot and I can hear
the wildebeest again.
(SNIFFING)
DEEBLE: There's a baby going in
a bit further,
-come OH.
-(WILDEBEEST GRUNTING)
Something's gotta happen.
Yeah, now he's right out there.
- Crocs right there next to him.
-(GRUNTING)
Oh, God, you can see the croc
underneath the surface,
you can see the swirl,
the dark shape and there he goes.
Ah! (CLICKS TONGUE)
Whoa.
And he missed him again.
Yeah, this time of year,
it's absolutely crucial for them.
If they don't feed now,
they're in dire straits.
Ah, here they come. Thirsty innocents.
Poor guys, that's better.
Come on, you can do it.
Got two there now, food coming down
on their knees next to them.
Come on, you can do it,
just one footstep further out,
that's all that croc needs.
Oh, yeah, yeah, go on.
There he goes.
Well, that was amazing,
it suddenly happened.
Trying to work out where the crocs were
underwater (CHUCKLES) was a nightmare.
(WHISPERING) That was so intense.
One minute there was nothing,
the next minute the bank
was covered in wildebeest,
-and then one was taken.
-(SNAPS FINGERS)
But I got it. (CHUCKLING)
<i>ATTENBOROUGH: Next time, the hunt is on
in the frozen north.</i>
<i>The high Arctic.</i>
<i>One of the toughest places on earth
in which to make a living.</i>
<i>To succeed here,</i>
<i>a predator must exploit
the few good times</i>
