Sick call!
Corman!
Hey Troop, forward right!
Yo!
Forward right, yo!
-Gentlemen, congratulations.
-Thank you, sir.
Indian scouts... Yate.
When you're dismissed, you will walk
your horses for half an hour.
Then water and picket them.
The Settler's store will remain open
untiI twelve o'clock.
-Let them have some beer.
-We thank you, CoroneI.
That's a fine idea.
Officers, post!
Gallop!
Prepare to dismount!
Dismount!
By the left, parade out!
-Good evening.
-Good evening, sir.
Good evening, sir.
Have a cup of your own coffee, York?
I've been thinking of nothing else
for the last two hours.
-Tough, huh?
-Tough, sir.
I haven't had a cup of coffee
with you...
since we rode down
the Shenandoah together.
Fifteen years ago, wasn't it?
Fifteen years, two months
and seven days.
How did you fare on patroI?
Had a running fight
for thirty-odd miles.
We captured Natches, their chief,
eight others...
before the Apaches reached the Rio
Grande and crossed into Mexico.
Pursuant to orders
I halted on our side of the river.
The men didn't like it very much.
Neither did you.
And neither do I,
but that's the policy...
and soldiers don't make policy,
they merely carry it out.
The State Department
could do something.
Oh, yes, they'll write
a sharp note of protest.
if you care to read
sharp notes of protest.
I'll declaim them over the graves
of the troopers...
who were guarding the waterholes.
Three of them staked
face-down on anthills.
You've got the dirtiest job in the army,
there's no doubt of that, Kirby.
I'm not complaining, sir.
I get paid for it.
Maybe you should complain.
I'll listen.
This coffee isn't as good
as it used to be.
I'll make a note of that.
But maybe, someday it'll get
better and stronger.
I'll drink to that, sir:
stronger.
Too bad about your son.
I hadn't heard.
I'm sorry, Kirby,
I thought you knew.
He failed mathematics
at West Point and...
and they've dropped him
from the military academy.
Indeed?
Oh, it's no disgrace
failing mathematics.
I just missed it myself
by the skin of my teeth.
I haven't seen my son
in fifteen years.
Yes, I know, it's...
Look, Kirby, this coffee's weak,
but it's all we have, more?
if it's all we have...
You're in the army now,
you're not behind a plough.
You'll never get rich
by digging a ditch.
You're in the army now.
You're in the army now,
you're not behind a plough.
You son-of-a gun,
you're on the bum.
You're in the army now.
Knock it off, knock it off.
Left face!
Aye, you're a fine body of men.
Now, put your bags down.
This is your home,
so make yourselves comfortable.
Aye, I bid you all welcome
to Fort Stark.
Recruits that you are...
but in no time at all,
you'll be soldiers.
Sure...
why in less than six months,
with good behaviour and hard work...
you'll be wearing yellow stripes
on your breeches.
Would you mind be putting
your cap back on your head, son?
Not at all, Doc.
Did any of yous ever ride a horse?
Yeah, some.
Now, answer the roll call.
-Adams.
-Present.
-¡Baker.
-Yo.
-Boone.
-Yes sir?
-Boone.
-Yeah?
Just say 'yo'.
Yo.
-Caroll.
-Yo.
Dirks... Dudds... Eton...
Franklin... Goodwin... Haggensmith...
Himes... Jeffs... Murphy...
O'Toole... Perkins... Selby... Tyree...
-York.
-Present, sir.
All right, pick up your bags.
Left face!
As you were, Sergeant.
I don't want you men to be fooled
about what's coming up for you.
Torture, at least that.
The War Department promised me
one hundred eighty men...
and they sent me eighteen all told.
You are the eighteen.
So, each one of you will have to do
the work of ten men.
If you faiI, I'll have you spread-eagled
on a wagon wheeI.
If you desert, you'll be found,
tracked down and broken into bits.
That is all.
Forward!
Ho!
Trooper York, sir!
I haven't seen you for 15 years.
So I've been told, sir.
I have no clear memory.
You proved that
when you failed at West Point.
Yes, sir.
-Were did you enlist?
-At Hollands Fall, sir. Next day.
Lied about your age.
-Recruit training?
-Jefferson barracks, sir.
On the officiaI record
you're my son...
but on this post
you're just another trooper.
You heard me tell the recruits
what I need from them.
Twice that
I'll expect from you.
At Chepoulapeck,
my father, your grandfather...
shot for cowardice
the son of a United States senator.
That was his duty.
I'll do mine.
You've chosen my way of life.
I hope you have the guts
to endure it.
But put out of your mind...
any romantic ideas that
it's a way of glory.
It's a life of suffering and hardship.
And uncompromising devotion
to your oath and your duty.
Have I the CoroneI permission to speak?
Within proper limits, yes.
I didn't ask to come
to this regiment, sir.
But I wouldn't have it otherwise
now that I'm here.
May I also put something straight?
Proceed.
I'm not in this post
to call you father.
I was ordered here as Trooper
Jefferson York, of the U.S. Cavalry.
And that is all I wish to be, sir.
-Then we understand each other.
-We do, sir.
Sergeant Major!
The recruits are for field duty,
as of now.
Dismissed.
Trooper York!
What are you waiting for?
Trooper York expects his salute
to be returned.
Military regulations, sir.
Quincannon!
Saddle your horses!
Give them their head, can't you?
Give them their head!
A little faster!
That's right!
Keep it coming now!
There we go!
Once again and faster!
Put it up another notch.
Give them a good jump.
Now, do you see how easy it is?
Why, when I was a young man
like yourselves...
I could jump nine feet tall and
with an Indian under each arm.
What tribe?
Once again and faster.
Horsemen!
Appears to me they make a lot of fuss
for jumping a horse over some sticks.
Yo.
That's a six-foot jump, Travis.
Now give them their head!
Now over!
There, you see?
That gives you an idea of what horsemen
should be like in the U.S. Cavalry.
Now, after that comes the Roman.
Now that's easy.
It's the way the Romans used to ride.
The ancient Romans.
Standing up!
Standing up!
Yo!
Slim, ups-a-daisy!
Mister, what time are you blowing
the horn around here for folks to eat?
Do you think you'd like to try
that before you eat?
You mean,
ride like them ancient Romans?
Yes.
Yo!
Let's go, Sandy!
Come on, Sandy!
Easy now, easy!
Horsemen.
Oh, boyo horsemen.
Nice team, Corporal.
Is that the generaI idea, Doc?
That's the generaI idea.
But before I'm through with you,
you'll be taking them jumps backwards.
Now, is there another man...
The Marshall wants to make
a routine check.
He thinks perhaps this man might be
among our new recruits.
Got anybody by the name of Tyree
among your horse thieves?
Horse thieves is it now?
-Horse thieves?
-That's what I said.
And they're all men wearing
the uniform of the U.S. Cavalry?
Fella I'm looking for is from Texas.
Wanted for questioning about a killing.
-Is there a man from Texas amongst you?
-Yes, sir. I'm from Texas.
My name is Boone.
DanieI Boone.
DanieI Boone? That name's kind
of familiar, ain't it, Mike?
Name's Tyree.
A fifty dollar reward.
A right tidy sum!
Tyree?
There's nobody here by that name.
Sergeant, take the Marshall to Settlers
and give them a wee drop of comfort.
-Yes, Major.
-Who's going to pay for that liquor?
-The Sergeant will pay for it.
-Me.
Horse thieves we don't have here.
But horsemen I'll make of yous yet.
Yo!
Is there anyone else who'd like
to be trying the jumps...
after the manner
of the Ancient Romans?
Yes, sir, I would.
Get it done, Johnny Reb.
Get up on them!
You'll get busted for this,
Quincannon.
Get your hat.
-You all right, boy?
-Yeah, I'm all right.
Now, curry them well
and cool them off, men.
In six months, we'll have
the finest drill team in the world.
Come on, Jeff, get in there!
Let them fight!
Come on!
Hey, cool it off, there.
Break it up!
Break it up there!
Break it up!
Break it up there!
Come on, break it up!
Break it up, I tell you.
Well, let them fight.
-Now, what started this fight?
-I refuse to answer, sir.
-Go ahead, tell him Reb.
-No.
This fella here spoke real derogatory
about the boy's pappy.
He also said he was the teacher's pet
of a chowder-headed Mick sergeant.
What's that mean, Doc?
-Did you say that?
-Yes, I did.
-You did, did you?
-Yes, I did.
-Did you mean it, did you?
-Yes, I did.
We'll settle this tonight,
behind the picket line.
Soldier fashion.
Marquess of Queensbury rules.
Chowdedd-faced, chow...
What was it he said?
Chowder-headed Mick sergeant.
Chowder-headed Mick...
And you meant it, did you?
-Yes, I did.
-Nine o'clock tonight, boys.
Get it done, Johnny Reb.
Atta-boy, Jeff!
Keep after him!
Come on, get him up!
Put some water on him!
You're winning boy.
Just like a mountain lion.
You're doing real good, Jeff, boy.
But don't forget to keep your left up!
Keep your left in his face, Jeff.
You're doing good.
You'll get busted for this, Quincannon.
You're doing all right, sonny,
but use that right.
Keep throwing that right in there!
Right jab, hit him with the right!
It's a lovely fight, Himes,
but watch them fouls.
None of that, none of that, see?
And when you come out of the clinching,
none of that.
Well, Quincannon, talk fast.
-Soldiers fight, sir.
-What caused it?
I refuse to answer, sir.
Respectfully, sir.
-Himes?
-I refuse to answer, sir.
-York?
-No, sir.
Soldiers fight, eh?
Carry on!
You heard what the CoroneI said.
Carry on with the fight.
Thanks, Himes.
-I'm sorry, soldier.
-I apologize.
Now, sonny,
let me have a look at that eye.
You're going to be all right.
You little rascal.
It's the left you should've been
watching!
The left, like that!
Good morning, sonny.
Why, that's castor oiI.
Wagon train, two hours
and twenty minutes late.
That's the CoroneI's quarters
over there, ma'am.
Well, Trunkett, when did you take
unto yourself a wife?
I ain't yet.
Begging your pardon, ma'am...
but unauthorised ladies
are not permitted on this post.
I'm not unauthorised.
I'm Trooper Jefferson York's mother.
I'm afraid
we have no accommodations...
no quarters for the mothers
of the enlisted men.
I've a pass
signed by General Sheridan.
May I help you, ma'am?
-I'll handle this, Captain.
-Thank you, sir.
Good evening, Kathleen.
Good evening, Kirby.
-Sergeant!
-Yes, sir.
See that Mrs. York's bags are unloaded
and taken to my quarters.
Yes, sir.
Welcome home, darling.
I see you still have
that arsonist with you.
You mean Quincannon?
He's a Sergeant Major
in the United States Army.
Anything he may have done long ago
in the line of duty...
he did it in obedience to my orders,
reluctantly, I may add.
Oh, the reluctant arsonist!
I suppose the safest way for us
to start our conversation would be...
for you to just say:
To what do I owe
the honour of your visit?
I saw the reason for your visit
this morning.
-How is he?
-He's grown considerably, I thought.
Right now, he's bruised up a little.
Had a fight, not much.
A fight?
With another soldier?
Hardly an officer.
Hardly with an officer.
-He's not gentleman enough for that.
-You said the world soldier.
-That's enough for me.
-Not for me.
Jeff was boyishly ashamed when
he was expelled from West Point.
He shouldn't have enlisted.
I could have sent him to Lexington.
He could have tutored in Mathematics
and then got his commission.
But he did enlist.
And he's here.
Here he'll stay and here he'll serve.
Ramrod, wreckage and ruin.
Still the same, Kirby.
Special privilege to special born.
Still the same, Kathleen.
Kirby, I've come to take Jeff home.
He signed enlistment papers.
He took an oath.
Oath!
Jeff can be released from the army.
Bought off honourably for the sum
of one hundred dollars.
I brought that amount with me,
in Yankee gold.
You forget one very important detaiI,
Kathleen.
Such a release requires my signature
as Commanding officer.
You've overlooked
several other important details.
Number one,
you're a fine figure of a woman.
Number two,
you probably haven't eaten.
There's a box of flat silver
in that chest.
I'll send someone over to set the table.
You will dine with me?
Of course.
The regimental singers.
Probably to serenade you.
That is very gracious of you.
Yellow stripe on breeches blue,
riding only forwards.
Just so we can ride behind
and gaily sing this chorus.
Brand and burn and mark his hide
and ride him every day.
Kiss your gal and leave her there
and hope she's going to stay.
Hope she's going to stay.
Hope she's going to stay.
-With Mrs. York's permission.
-Thank you.
I'll take you home again, Kathleen...
across the ocean wild and wide.
To where your heart has ever been...
since first you were my blushing bride.
The roses all have left your cheeks.
I watch them fade away and die.
This music is not of my choosing.
I'm sorry, Kirby.
I wish it had been.
...and tears begrime
your loving eyes.
Oh...
I will take you back, Kathleen...
to where your heart will feel no pain.
And when the fields
are fresh and green...
I'll take you to your home...
...again...
Goodnight, Kathleen.
Sleep well.
I'm sorry to dispossess you.
I dispossessed you more forcibly
fifteen years ago.
You've grown more thoughtfuI.
Pleasant dreams.
Goodnight, Kathleen.
-Who's there?
-It's Sergeant Major Quincannon.
Johnny Horseblanket!
Sergeant, tell them Indians
to stop that howling.
And make them put them fires out.
Would you like to have me carry you
across the bridge?
I would not.
I want some black-eyed peas,
I want some mustard greens...
I want some corn-one on the side.
I want my chicken fried
with a golden hide...
Uh-huh, Saint Antone!
When I was a kid, had a locket.
And inside was a picture
of Davy Crockett.
I know a gal named Ann
who lives in Texarcan...
and loves a boy in Arkansas.
But when they take a ride,
it's on the Texas side...
Uh-huh, Saint Antone!
Say, what was that verse
you used to sing about the Alamo?
Trooper York!
Fellas, this is my mother.
Deeply honoured, ma'am.
-Glad to make your acquaintance, ma'am.
-Howdy, ma'am.
You don't have to hide your bruises,
Jeff.
Your father told me all about them.
What kind of man is he, mother?
He's a lonely man.
He's a very lonely man.
They say he's a great soldier.
I suppose he is, but...
what makes soldiers great
is hatefuI to me.
I've come to take you home, Jeff.
I can't leave, Mother.
It'd be quitting.
You're stubborn and proud, Jeff.
Just like he is.
Just like you are, Mother.
-I'll buy you out.
-No.
I failed at West Point.
I'm going to work this out my own way.
I'll take you home as soon as
your father signs your papers.
Maybe they didn't tell you, Mother...
but the application requires
my signature, too.
I refuse to sign it.
I'd like to...
Oh, them blasted coyotes!
What coyotes, sir?
Them ain't coyotes, sir.
How long have you been out West?
Long enough to know a coyote
when I ear it, sir.
Watch it!
Ben?
Coyotes?
Jeff, Jeff, turn out that light.
Hey you, blow Call to Arms.
Call To Arms.
Yes, sir.
This is an attack, Preston.
Form a skirmish group.
Skirmishers, follow me!
Uncle Jimmy!
Uncle Jimmy!
-Ladies all right?
-Fine, sir.
-How's Mrs. York?
-Mrs. York is not in her quarters.
Trooper York...
take your mother
back to her quarters.
Yes, sir.
I'll see you later, Captain.
Chirakawee,
Mesqualero...
Chirakawee...
Mesqualero...
White Mountain...
They've concentrated three tribes.
That means real trouble, gentlemen.
Unless we can stop them
before they cross the Rio Grande.
Captain Sanjah,
you will form Troop A...
two bandoliers of ammunition
per trooper, four days rations.
-Is that clear?
-Yes, sir.
-Sergeant!
-Yes, sir.
Ready to move out in thirty minutes.
I suppose I'm under arrest for being
out of bounds, as you call it.
No, but we can't have
the CoroneI's lady fainting...
every time there's a little shooting.
Kirby!
I'll take them.
Thank you.
Column of twos, Captain.
Ride by twos. Trot!
Yo!
Singers, give us a tune.
We'd better get along on our way,
old gal.
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal.
'Cause you bet your life
I'd never part with Sal.
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal.
Long bridge, everybody down.
Low bridge
for we're coming to a town.
And you'all always know your neighbour
and you'all always know your pal.
if you've ever navigated
on the Erie Canal.
Water, Sandy.
-Hang these up by the feet, Sandy.
-Yo.
-Good morning, Mrs. York.
-Good morning, Doctor.
-Busy woman.
-Oh, yes indeed.
Can I help you with your wash?
Well, I generally let one of
the other ladies do my things.
But I'm sure the Sergeant here
would like to give you his trade.
As a doctor, I would diagnose those
as saddle sores.
-Trooper Tyree?
-Here, sir.
I've a demand from the Deputy
United States Marshall to seize you.
Under warrant issued
by due and legal process...
by the District Court
Fernando X. Hernandez Judge...
on charges of manslaughter.
The way that language sounds,
I must be arrested.
As the Commanding Officer
is not present...
you will await his signature
to take your prisoner.
Got any place
I can lock this soldier boy...
till I get them papers signed?
With a fella like this,
I mean, a desperado...
why don't you leave him
at the hospital?
That's a good idea.
I'll get my feet checked.
They've been bothering me.
You want to come along peacefuI-like or
you want me to use these cuffs on you?
I'm always peacefuI, Marshall, when
there ain't no use doing nothing else.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Are you arresting that nice young
man for manslaughter?
Not me, Mrs. York.
The United States deputy Marshall.
Manslaughter!
Well, what are you going
to do about it?
A nice gentle souI who'd walk
ten miles out of his way...
before he'd step on an ant.
You go to the hospital and get him
some tobacco, anything he wants.
We'll also get him
a lawyer to defend him.
-He's partial to molasses candy.
-Well, get some.
Yankee justice!
Arresting a nice young man like that
for manslaughter...
and promoting arsonists
to be Sergeant Majors.
Uncle Jimmy!
Singers, sing out.
make you forget your thirst.
Yellow stripes on breeches blue,
riding only forwards.
Just so we can ride behind
and gaily sing this chorus.
Oh, brand and burn and mark his hide
and ride him every day.
Kiss your girl and leave her there
and hope she's going to stay.
Hope she's going to stay.
Doctor darling,
I've got spots in front of me eyes...
and me heart is palpitating and I...
-Sitting on it.
-Thank you, Doctor.
-I feeI better now.
-It'll kill you or cure you.
Doctor, with your fine education,
would you be telling me something?
-Yeah?
-What is an arsonist?
An arsonist is a person
that sets buildings on fire...
for profit
or perverse excitement.
Is that what it is?
Why?
It all started when we rode down
the Shenandoah valley, Doctor.
Every trooper of General Sheridan's
command during the late war.
It was me cursed luck...
to be ordered to burn the crops
and the barns at Bridesdale.
With herself looking daggers at me...
and sables at the CoroneI.
He was a captain then.
Silent as death she was...
with a babe in her arms,
Little Jeff.
Little Jeff.
Well, it was as grim duty for both
you and the CoroneI.
That was his wife's plantation,
wasn't it?
Aye. It's said it was owned
by the same family...
ever since that grand Irishman,
Sir Walter Raleigh...
first smoked a pipe.
Seems like I've heard
that story before.
And there's the black hand
that did the dirty deed.
I wish you'd knock it with that stick!
Troop halt!
I make it out to be a Mexican officer
approaching to meet you, sir.
CooI off and water your horses.
Bugler!
Honours, please.
Three flourishes.
Troop, left!
Welcome to Rio Bravo.
Buenas tardes, eI Teniente.
And my respects,
Sr. CoroneI York.
Wish I'd reached the Rio Grande
half an hour sooner.
I wish the same, Sr. CoroneI.
It would have saved me three brave men
killed and two wounded.
Have you medical aid
for your wounded?
Unfortunately, no.
Tell the Surgeon Striker to bring up
the pack mule, cross the Rio Grande...
-With your permission, Lieutenant...
-I grant it with gratitude, CoroneI.
and attend our wounded comrades
on the Rio Bravo side.
-I would suggest, Lieutenant.
-Yes, Sr. CoroneI?
Natches and his band are a scourge
to both your country and mine.
We can catch them now, before
they reach their mountain stronghold.
I would gladly place myself and my men
under your command, Lieutenant...
if you would invite us
to join you in pursuit.
Unfortunately, Sr. CoroneI,
my orders are firm.
I must, above all,
protect the Rio Bravo.
With three men, sir?
That's courage.
And my orders are firm also.
I must stay on the Rio Grande side.
My complements to your fidelity
to duty, sir.
Adiós.
I'm eternally in your debt,
Sr. CoroneI.
Bueno, vámonos.
Wait, I know she will.
I can see her still.
With longing in her eyes
when day is done.
My girl is purple...
waiting there.
And I know deep inside me...
she is fairest of the fair.
So if my longings wrings my heart...
and tears get in my eyes...
I'll hurry back again to her...
here the blue shadows die.
I'm sorry, Kathleen.
Your sense of duty again, Kirby?
I've seen things that make
my sense of duty important.
I'll take you home.
I'm sorry your duty made you
destroy two beautifuI things:
Bridesdale and us.
I was sorry too, when it had to be done.
You know that.
But you rebuilt Bridesdale.
That was easy.
It required just physical effort.
The other would require more?
It would start if you'd let Jeff go.
I'd get you back?
If that were a condition.
I could say yes to you very easily,
Kathleen...
but I owe Jeff something,
he's a fine boy.
But he must learn that a man's
word to anything...
even his own destruction,
must be honoured.
-Good evening, York.
-Good evening, sir.
How about a cup of coffee?
General...
to your very good health, sir.
To the President
of the United States.
Perhaps Mrs. York will favour us
with a sentiment.
To my only rival:
The United States Cavalry.
Sir, the traditional singers
would like to sing...
The regimental singers.
That's just what I was going to say,
sir.
The regimental singers would like
to sing a traditional song.
Very good, Quincannon.
Carry on.
Was down by the glenside.
I met an old woman.
A-plucking young nettles.
She ne'er saw me coming.
I listened awhile...
to the song she was humming.
Glory-o, glory-o,
to the bold Fenian men.
These fifty long years...
since I saw the moon beaming...
On strong manly forms...
and on eyes with hope gleaming.
I see them again now.
In all my daydreaming...
Glory-o, glory-o,
to the bold Fenian men.
I passed on my way.
Gold be praised that I met her.
Be my life long or short...
I shall never forget her.
We'll maybe have great men.
But we'll never have better.
Thank you, men.
Do you suppose the men might be
allowed the privilege...
of the Settlers Store until midnight,
CoroneI?
We thank the General.
Now don't abuse the privilege, Men.
The live we live is royal
in the U.S. Cavalry.
-Goodnight, General.
-Well, you're not...
May we walk with you
to your quarters, Mrs. York?
-Thank you.
-Goodnight, Mrs. York.
-Goodnight.
-Goodnight, sir.
If that Marshall's here,
I'll sign those papers now.
Did you hear that music?
That sweet lilting music.
Hey, you blasted policeman...
get down to the CoroneI's office
and get your papers signed.
And take this poor boy's soul
with yous.
No hard feelings, son.
No hard feelings.
-Protect my interest, will you, Doc?
-Yeah!
Protect my interest!
Protect my interest!
Hey, son...
do you know that man has a warrant
charging you with manslaughter?
A lot of people use that word,
'manslaughter', pretty freely.
Boy, why don't you tell us
about this?
Maybe we can help you.
Well, it could be that a fella had
a run-in with a Yankee down in Texas.
Something about
the fella's sister.
And it could be that the Yankee
got a gun and started shooting.
Got himself killed.
Mrs. York wants to get you a lawyer
to get you out of this scrape.
Thank her kindly for me
and tell her...
Look, fellas...
my sister's getting married
to a man she grew up with.
A Texican.
Fine fella.
They kind of planned on going
to California and starting fresh.
I don't think it's quite right to start
a lot of talk and scandal in open court...
until their dust
has settled behind them.
Well, it makes sense to me.
Of course, when I hear
they're in California...
I'll be wanting that lawyer,
wanting him bad.
Tell you the truth, I kind of like
this man's army.
-Thank you for your kindness, Doctor.
-Yeah.
Let's get her done, Sergeant.
If that boy was one of my troopers...
I wouldn't be so eager
to see him get hung.
I'll just take a little sup
for me cold.
When I'm finished with it,
I'll take you to the CoroneI's tent...
unless you're a blackguard,
steal a horse...
and stay away for a few days.
Come in!
...grant for the Deputy United States
Marshall to seize one Travis Tyree...
under warrant issued by...
in due legal process...
Mrs. York, sir, I believe,
has become interested in the case.
She's written a lawyer in Dallas
to represent him.
Well, if...
a Dallas lawyer can't get a man off
a charge of manslaughter...
Halt, who goes there?
Hey!
Corporal of the guard!
-My horse.
-Yes, sir.
I sacrificed the happiness of your home
once, Kirby, to the needs of war.
Now, I'll probably ruin
your army career.
I'm going to issue an order
and give it to you personally.
I want you to cross the Rio Grande,
hit the Apache and burn them out.
I'm tired of hit and run.
I'm sick of diplomatic hide and seek.
Strip the camp of all the women and
children and send them to Fort Bliss.
Be prepared to remain all winter.
All next winter if necessary.
I waited a long time for that order,
sir...
which of course, I didn't hear.
Of course, you didn't hear.
If you fail, I assure you the members
of your court martial...
will be the men that rode with us
down the Shenandoan.
I'll handpick them myself.
Shenandoah!
I wonder what history will say
about Shenandoah.
I can tell you what my wife
said about it.
What seems to be the trouble there,
Kirby?
Shenandoah valley,
place called Bridesdale...
and a fella named Sheridan.
-How about a cup of coffee, sir?
-Yeah, sure.
You'll find it's stronger.
You look very elegant, sir.
Gentlemen...
with the regiment leaving for
a winter campaign in the morning...
and the women and children
being sent to Fort Bliss...
I'm sure you have many arduous
and difficult tasks to perform.
Please do not let me
keep you from them.
-Thank you for the coffee, madam.
-You're welcome.
-You're very kind, Mrs. York.
-Thank you.
You do look very elegant, Kirby.
What I said about the women
and children is true.
You're leaving in the morning
for Fort Bliss.
Jeff is going with you.
He'll be one of the escort.
He'll hate it, Kirby.
He'll think that...
He's my son... our son...
He's too young to...
He'll still hate it, Kirby.
But I love you for it.
I cleaned and ironed your uniform.
It's a good job.
I'd like to get my hands
on this white jacket sometime.
That'll cost you four bits,
as they say out here.
Four bits, huh?
Ten dollars!
Kathleen, that was meant for a...
There's your change, Kirby.
I've been carrying that around for
a long time, hoping that someday...
I'll take the flowers now.
Well, I...
Aren't you going to kiss me
goodbye?
I never want to kiss you goodbye,
Kathleen.
Well, here we are, children.
We're going on the choo choo.
Come on!
There you are!
-Ready, Mr. Markham?
-Ready, sir.
Carry on!
Goodbye, Mrs. York.
Very pleasant, having you here.
Oops-a-daisy!
Jimmy, you're going to be
a good boy now, aren't you?
Oh, darling, darling.
By your leave, sir.
By your leave, sir.
-Well, be careful, Trunkett.
-Yes, sir.
Prepare to mount!
Mount!
-I got this from the Paymaster.
-That's sweet of you, honey.
-I'll write you at Fort Bliss.
-Be sure not to forget.
I won't forget.
Wagons and escort, lead out.
Forward, yo!
-Hey, Travis.
-I thought you'd show up.
Where's your canteen, Sandy?
This one's dry.
We'll have to report you
to the Sergeant for being late.
That ain't worrying me none.
I'm hungry!
Beans!
Nobody ever told the army they grow beef
round this part of the country?
Not lately.
We'll be on cold rations for three days.
One of you better ride up ahead
and tell the Lieutenant that...
the waterhole I came by down there
this morning was all muddied up.
Heap big Indian signs.
We'd better get going.
Thank your pappy
for the loan of this horse.
You thank him!
Slim!
I got you! Jump on!
Himes, come on!
Uncle Jimmy!
Uncle Jimmy!
Right behind those rocks there,
ladies!
Back to the post and tell the CoroneI
what's happened.
Look out, Indian!
Jeff, Jeff!
Give me your gun, boy.
Go ahead, Jeff.
Troop halt!
Troop halt!
Doctor Wilkins...
-Report.
-Four troopers, sir.
They got away with the children.
Trooper York brought the word.
We came as soon as we could.
Those children, Kirby!
We'll get them back.
Well done, men.
Forward trot, yo!
Follow me!
Doctor!
Doctor, sir.
Corporal Bell.
Sorry, son.
-May I've permission to go
 forward, sir?  - Stay here.
But it's my wife.
If it was yours, wouldn't you want...
Yes, I would, but if I had a friend,
he'd keep me here.
Stay with me, boy.
Pack mule!
Troop halt!
Troop halt!
Who's that?
The deserter, Tyree, sir.
On your horse.
Arrest him!
You're under arrest, Tyree!
-Any liquor in this village?
-Mucha tequila.
They was slugging it down
copious-like when I left.
-Drums, singing?
-Yes, sir.
Vengeance dance.
They'll dance until dawn and then...
-Where are the children held?
-In an old church, sir.
Is it dark enough for you
to get in there?
With two men I'll pick, sir.
Two men you pick?
I know that you are an excellent
judge on horse-flesh, Trooper Tyree.
You proved that when you stole
my horse.
But how are you as a judge of men
for a dangerous mission?
I consider myself as a good judge
of the men I trust, sir.
That's a good answer.
Call your volunteers.
Sandy!
Jeff!
Troopers Boone and York!
Yo!
Take my horse: good swimmer.
-Get it done, boy.
-Thank you, sir.
Sandy, are you scared?
Me?
Yo.
Troop halt!
Pass the word: dismount.
Forward by trooper.
Oh, Sandy, I'm sorry.
I thought you were an Indian .
Shh!
Be quiet, Margaret-Mary.
Hello, Jeff!
Thanks very much.
Listen, honey,
where are the children?
They're over there asleep.
You're going
to have to be a brave girI...
'cause there's going to be
lots of shooting.
Oh, goodie!
You youngsters be quiet.
I can't figure out which side
that kid's on, them or ours.
Let's go, Alamo!
Margaret-Mary!
What the hell's the matter
with you, Jeff?
Oh, I'm sorry, Sandy.
Bugler, sound charge!
-First Platoon.
-Second Platoon.
Navajo Scouts.
Follow me!
Come on, shooters, follow me!
Wagons coming.
Get them loaded.
Margaret, get out of it.
Come on!
All right, men.
Let's end. Follow me!
-Okay, take it away.
-Where have you been, Margaret-Mary?
All right, once more, men!
Hit them again!
Pull it out, Jeff!
Go ahead!
Get it done, Reb.
Yo!
-Children secure?
-Yes, sir. Ready to move out.
Son, help me to my horse.
Bugler, sound recall!
Our boy did well.
The honour detail is formed, sir.

beyond the call of duty on 8 July...

Trooper York...
Trooper Tyre...

Well, whatever else the young man is,
he's a good judge of horse-flesh.
An excellent judge, sir.
Excellent.
Passing review.
First Troop forward.

Eyes right!
