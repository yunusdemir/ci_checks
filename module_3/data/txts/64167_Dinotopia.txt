David
wait
Look, I'm proud of you
Just leave me alone, okay
You tried, you didn't quit
I wish Dad could have seen you
He didn't need to see me fail again
You didn't fail
Wait, Dave.. Dave...
Leave him
I don't believe it
He's gonna jump
No he's not, Karl! Leave him!
David!
Look!
Did you see that?
Way to go Davey!
The senate recognizes
Skybax Captain Oonu
We are ready to hear your report
Lord Mayor
Senators
Unabba has been evacuated
There are reports of large fatal attacks
along the Eastern borders
Permission to speak frankly, Sir
Please, continue
Our squadrons can no longer patrol
the Eastern territories
The Tyrannosaurus herd is destroying
everything in it's path
And the Pteranodons are breaching
all their traditional boundaries
I request permission
to reassign the corps
to protect refugees on the eastern
approach to Waterfall City
You are not the only problems to be
experiencing difficulties
We must evacuate everyone
in the outer settlements
and bring them here to Waterfall City
for protection, Sir
But we cannot support the whole of
Dinotopia here on this island city
We simply don't have the resources
Last week my new students graduated
I have been pushing them harder
than ever before
I am not training them to seek peace
I am training them to fight and I fear
I am training them to die
He's right!
We must make an expedition to the World
Beneath to find new sunstones.
Sit down!
Yes, but Mayor!
Just as we live by codes of Dinotopia
so must we prepare to die
And die we will
Lord Mayor! Lord Mayor!
Yes, yes, what is it?
They're coming sir
Who is coming?
The refugees sir, a sea of them
Look at those poor souls
I could just grab those Senators
by their robes
and shake them!
Somebody has to do something!
That's called anger ZlPEAU
you're making progress
The prime sunstone
won't last much longer...
Wait a minute
This looks like the Temple in the Swamp
Yes, of course
According to the scroll
it is called the Temple of Kora
These carvings look very familiar
We must go back there
If this leads to the World Beneath
that's where the sunstones will be
I'm sure of it
But, that's also where we'll find
those prehistoric crocodiles
Yes, and my tail is only just
growing back, you know
But, it's the only entrance ZlPEAU
Suppose it's blocked, or flooded
Maybe it's not even an entrance
We're just guessing
That horrible Cyrus Crabb had a scroll
which said
there was another entrance
beneath the sea
called the Diamond Cave...
I will go to the library and research it
We haven't got time for any more research
What are we going to do?
Just stand around and
wait for the carnivores
to come crashing through the city gates?
Marion's right. We got to do something
I'm going back to the temple
Even if I have to go alone
Well, I guess we are going back
to the swamp
Somebody's got to stay here
and look after Twenty-six
It would be an honor
And don't leave the window open
at night
at her age she can
get a chill very easily
I think I do know how to take care
of a baby dinosaur
Oh and she likes her bread dipped
in warm milk
Now you behave yourself 26
and don't give Uncle ZlPEAU a hard time
There he is. Finally!
Well that took long enough
What? I was just making sure she is OK
If you're going
where I think you're going
you'd better turn back
You'll never find the entrance
I'm done taking advice from you
I paid three expeditions to
explore that swamp temple
You know what? Not one came back
for their money
We're not afraid
Yeah, that's right
There is another way, Karl, a safer way
In a few days my plans will be sorted
If you want to come with me
No way, Cyrus! Forget it!
Don't be a fool, boy!
I'm trapped on this island same as you
and whether I like it here or not
You sabotaged my boat!
Yes, and you gave me a rock
instead of a sunstone
so let's call it even, is that alright?
What's he talking about?
Nothing
Don't you understand?
I want the same thing you want
I want to save this hell of a place
Not because I like it
because I want to save me own skin
Forget it!
Hey! Karl!
Here
I don't know if it'll work
Must be fifty years old
Keep your wits about you, Karl
There's worse than the Mosasaurs
to worry about...
Don't listen to him
Come on, he's just trying to scare us
Karl, I have to ask you something
Yeah?
Is it true what Crabb said
you stole a sunstone?
I didn't steal it
I just borrowed it for awhile
Anyway, I gave it back, didn't l?
I can't think of anything much worse
you could do
It's a hatchery, Karl!
Yea? Well I heard all
about your mountain trip
And what exactly did you hear?
That you spent the night with my brother
in one of those nests
SO?
So? So what happened up there
between you two?
We got very close
that's what happened
Because, unlike you
he's a sensitive soul
They make it to the other side
and approach the temple
Come on! Let's keep going
Did you hear that?
No. Will you stop doing that!
I'm getting a bad feeling about this
No, I think David is right
Something feels very wrong
We should leave
Wait!
Come on, lets go!
Keep going! Stop!
Karl?
Come on! Lets go! Lets go! Come on!
How glad are we to see you!
David and Karl Scott
you are under arrest
You'll be escorted by guard to
face trial in Waterfall City
I can't believe this
We must contact my father immediately!
Your father issued the order, Marion
Why are we being arrested?
On what charge?
It's not a single charge
You seem to have broken just
about every law in Dinotopia
Don't despair, lads
It could be worse
You could be dead
Hope you got a good lawyer
Not that it will make any difference
Hey, Cyrus!
That flare gun you gave me?
It came in handy. Thanks
There's no time to squander
on past misunderstandings
We have work to do boys
A good lawyer, remember?
This court is now is session
David and Karl Scott
The charges facing you could
hardly be more serious
You have brought disruption
and violence to Dinotopia
In total you stand accused of
twenty one violations - twenty two
Not only did you
attempt to leave Dinotopia
which is forbidden
you also stole a sacred sunstone...
from a hatchery!
Not satisfied with these crimes
you both violated the sacred entrance
to the World Beneath
and awakened the pteranodon swarm
that has guarded the temple for centuries
There is no defense for these actions
However
you are entitled to representation
Do you have a lawyer?
Present, your honors
My apologies for being late
Mammals and Saurians of the jury
I accept the behavior of these boys
is somewhat unconventional
But what heart they have!
My own life was saved
by an act of selfless
Dinotopian courage from Karl
when I was viciously attacked
by a giant Mosasaur!
I would like to enter my half-bitten tail
as Exhibit A
Would you like to tell us
why you were put in jeopardy
in the first place?
Yes, because the boys had fallen
over the falls
while fighting
at their graduation ceremony
A disgraceful
breach of civilized behavior
Yes, yes, well
I would have to agree with you there
your honor
He is on our side, isn't he?
We will now take testimony
from Skybax captain, Oonu
Thank you, Lord Mayor
When David came to the Skybax academy
he was one of the least promising pupil
I have encountered
Yet, through strength in character
he over came his weaknesses, trained hard
and finally showed us that he is a flyer
A flyer like none I have ever seen
I am proud to of been his teacher
Yes, thank you captain Oonu for
that glowing testimony
now rejoin your squadron
I initially found the boys disobedient
quarrelsome, problematic
They're not like us and perhaps
they never will be
But how we call ourselves Dinotopians
if we only respect those
who agree with us?
If we are to learn first we must listen
In spite of our differences
I have come to respect
the boys tremendously
One raindrop raises the sea
Exactly, your honours!
So think of
what two raindrops could do!
David, we're doomed
None of this would have happened
if you hadn't sent our daughter
to Canyon City
Nothing at all would happen
if it were left up to you, Waldo
You may be happy to take risks
with our daughter's life
but I certainly am not
Can you stop talking about me
as though I'm not here?!!!
Karl and David risked
their lives to save you!
And everyone else here!
And you've thrown them in jail
They are simply being confined
to quarters
They must be allowed to cause
any more trouble
Trouble? The sunstones are failing!
That's trouble!
At least they have the courage
to try and find a solution!
Marion, your mind has become clouded
in recent months
Those boys are not your responsibility
You should concentrate
on completing your studies
Do one thing at a time
7th law of Dinotopia
Eat to live, don't live to eat
10th law of Dinotopia
Marion!!
Do you see the terrible influence
these boys have had on her?
She never used to be sarcastic
If you're in such harmony
why do you live a hundred miles
away from each other?
We both serve Dinotopia in different ways
And duty before personal satisfaction
You see? It's happened again!
Again? Waldo, why didn't you tell me
that this has happened before...
It's just a temporary situation
The polishers will be at work
even as we speak
It usually last only a few seconds
That is the prime sunstone!
If that fails...
We are due to discuss
the situation tomorrow...
--Discuss? We're sitting in the darkness!
Something has to be done
A Dinotopian mind is a calm mind, Marion
There! You see. Back to normal
Nothing at all to worry about
Don't despair, Karl
It could be worse
They only placed you under house arrest
I'm too old to be grounded
Exactly! I mean, everything we did --
well, except for you stealing a sunstone
but --
Everything else --
like going to the temple --
we were trying to help
So why can't the senate understand that?
Well, the senate may be angry
but I thing
I can get you a light sentence
I can't believe
these people can charge us
for trying to help them!
I mean, who are they to say
what we can and cannot do!
Remember to keep
your closing speech short
and please whatever you do
don't upset Mayor Waldo
All that remains before judgement
are the closing speeches
from Karl and David
Serious accusations have been made
and you may speak freely and with candor
Speak freely is about the last thing
you're allowed to do here!
Oh no!
You do this big number about listening
but no one really listens
Well, listen to me now!
I don't care about your rules
and superstitions
so you can do what you want to me
but you should let my brother go
You're going to need every Skybax cadet
in the corps
This whole place is going to hell
unless you do something about it and
you know it
Oh dear!
You didn't have to do that
Yes, I did and don't
make a big thing of it
Wait a minute?
This court has reached a judgement
Karl and David
you will both resume your studies
and you will not leave Waterfall City
until you have both fully
understood your transgressions
Karl, you are deemed unfit to care
for an infant
and your Corythosaurus partner
will be taken to the city orphanage
for adoption
No! No way!
Karl, sit down. Don't make it any worse
We are all in accord on this matter
We would like to lodge an appeal!
We will review the case
in one year's time
One year?
Court dismissed!
I'm telling you
I'm sick of this place,
I'm not going to let them
take 26 away from me
Hey! Are you listening to me?
I'll get it
Oh, no. You're going to put me
in the sack again!
I'm not going to hurt you
Your not?
No, I'm not.
I'm here to help the boys
You promise?
It's all right ZlPEAU
Let him in
Ham. Okay, but on your head be it
I've waited twenty years for this
The final pieces of the jigsaw
The captain's log of the Rebecca's Folly
which you kindly borrowed for me
And the journal of Arthur Denison
the first true explorer of Adenectopia
This is his account of the World Beneath
Fascinating!
You see, Arthur Denison made it
to the World Beneath and back
but he wasn't alone
There was another man with him
Lee Crab. My father
Together the two of them explored
the World Beneath
and on their return they were promptly
arrested by the Senate
Violation of ancient laws and so on
So now I know the way
to the sinusotomies caves
and the way out of Adenectopia
But I can't do it alone, not with this...
I need your help, boys
I don't trust him
What's not to trust?
So you've known about the sunsets
cave all along?
You see, I've spent the past
twenty years reading everything
I could find on the World Beneath
The Senate would
have stopped me long ago
if they knew of my plans, I'm sure
But lucking for them they didn't
Because now I'm the only one
who can save those damn scales
No offence, Professor
Do you have anything
we can mix this with?
What is that?
Arctics Eleusis
It's am.. A rare plant extract
Now can you please take this
and give it to the guards
It won't hurt them will it?
No, no,no,no just a nasty headache
when they wake up
Nothing serious, I promise
Refreshments!
I'll just leave them over here. Enjoy!
Once they find you're missing
they'll block the bridge
and we'll be trapped in the city?
The canal runs under the garbage chute
next to my shop
A hundred feet downstream
there is a red buoy
I will leave a boat for you there
But first there is something I need
and Professor
I'm afraid you're the only one
who can help
What? Me?! Are you sure?
I can get us to the World Beneath
but we don't stand a fighting chance
without a map of the caves down below
There's a map?
Yeah, Denison's journals
were confiscated
when he returned
from the World Beneath
And locked up
in the library archives
If we can find the journal
then we have the map
And then what?
Take the boat down the Pooling River
I'll take care of the rest
Hurry! Quick
Good show, boys.
Good luck and Godspeed
Well if it's here
it will be in this cabinet
I thought you said
the fire destroyed all the books
and scrolls on the World Beneath?
It's true that the mail library
was badly burnt
but not all the books were destroyed
After the fire
It was decided to restore
the more valuable documents
and place the in this archive
for safe keeping
Oh it's no use, will never find it
Hey guys! I think this is it!
"The journal of Arthur Denison
Victorian engineer and Explorer Volume 2:
The World Beneath"
Masorah, lend me your nose old friend
"This private volume of my memoirs
will never be published
Odontoprisis hold
the World Beneath sacred
and I have no wish to offend
their deep spiritual beliefs
Nevertheless, my expedition
by submarine revealed
Perhaps, we can read it later
Listen
"l found enormous caves
with strange phosphorescence
I began to believe that they had been
occupied in ancient history
first by dinosaurs and
then later human cultures...
This way! This way!
Do you still have their scent Masorah?
We'll get them for good this time...
Somebody is coming!
Guards seize them at once!
Marion, Marion!
Stop those two boys
Don't let them escape!
Marion! Come back!
Wait for me
Why am I doing this?
I'll never be allowed
in the library again
This way
This way! Hurry
You go that way. You with me
ZlPEAU, ZlPEAU come on!
What are you doing
This was where he threw me in the canal
and stuffed me in a sack!
This is making me feel very anxious
Don't be such a baby!
Where is the boat?
Over there
ZlPEAU, you go and get the boat
Yes, what? Me?
Go on! Go! Now
Quickly, quickly get in
Come on Marion
that's it. Quick, quickly! Quick!
Maybe one of my ancestors
was a sailor after all
Well Cyrus really came through this time
Well, don't thank him yet
Yes, well personally I'm not quite sure
about him yet
We are heading to the cargo chute
but its not designed
for the Saurians or humans
for that matter
What do you mean?
Oh, I think that's it, now
Does anyone know where we're going?
No. Guess we'll just have to go
where the current takes us
How very Dinotopian, David
It is! Well said David
Did Crabb say exactly
where he would meet us?
He seemed to think
we would be able to find him
Up ahead, look!
Could that be it
Oh dear
we could still turn back you know
Isn't that Cyrus's calling card?
Wait for me
Slimy
What is it? Monosaurus
Who could do such a thing
Welcome aboard
Good to see you again
I trust you all had a pleasant
and uneventful trip
Did you do this?
Oh that. Oh me?
No,no,no,no now you are insulting
the Crabb family name
No that's merely a small
but regrettable part of the collection
acquired by my father
He was a man of many traits
much like myself
This was his store house
I'm sorry would you like a drink?
Sure
You'll need one where we are going
Gross!!!
Very interesting isn't
rather a smoky after taste
Well, enough talk
now it's time to show you my pride
and joy
Over here
She's a beauty isn't she?
No one knows it survived
Dennison's submarine
There is no way
I'm going down there in that!
It doesn't look in too bad a shape
No
Careful Karl, oh dear
Maybe not
Oh, there you go.
You can be our chief mechanic
And you can be our navigator
Thanks
What about me? What can I do?
Professor, I haven't forgot about you
Those keen eyes of yours,
sharper than a humans
Oh well, that's very true, Thank you
Will you be so very kind
as to keep look out for us
What? Out there?
Yes, out there
Go on. Run along
By myself?
It's OK, ZlPEAU
This one do anything?
Right Rutter!
This?
Yes, we like that!
Hey! How's it going?
Hey! You know
I've been thinking about
this expedition
Yeah?
Well the first time
we found an entrance
to the World Beneath
it's all full of giant crocodiles
Right
And the second time
it's full of giant bats, right?
Yeah, what's your point?
Well...
What the hell is that for?
I rest my case
Well the engine is okay
I replaced the pistons
I can't figure out what fuels this thing
I'll give you a clue
Sunstones
That's why you've been stealing
the sunstones!
I've tried every sunstone I could find
But none of them seem fit
And then I was looking
at pretty young Marion here
and suddenly it hit me
This sunstone was given to me
by my grandmother..
It was given to your grandmother Oriana
by the explorer Arthur Dennison
And the note..."Find the Light"
Would you mind terribly,my dear
if we borrowed it
This is the most valuable thing
I possess
Try the propeller now
Well Marion, now it's time to say
Bon Voyage!
What do you mean?
Well, I'm sorry my dear
but neither you nor that scaley outside
ZlPEAU, can come
There's only room
for three aboard this vessel
The submarine is built for four
I'm not one to tempt our good fortune
not when the future of Dinotopia hangs
in the balance
We'll be heavy enough
when those sunstones
are on board
Come on
He's right, Marion
Promise me you'll both be careful
I don't want anything to happen
to either of you
I love you both
We'll be alright
OK. Lets go
Did you hear that? She loves us both
She was looking at me when she said it
Come on we're wasting time
The World Beneath awaits!
Lord Mayor
Your reports, cadet?
The most recent sighting report of case
in excess of Hundred thousand Pteranodons
A hundred thousand?
Of the three squadrons assigned missions
today only ours has returned
What is of Volcanian?
Volcanian is gone, sir
There is no one left alive
That's not possible
If they continue on their current flight
path the pteranodons
will converge on Waterfall City
in less than twelve hours
Twelve hours?
I have other communities to warn sir
Yes, yes of course
Dismissed. Breathe deep
Fly high
This should send us down
No, no move away
Move away
Let's see,
we need to let a bit of air out
As far as I can tell
we've got about three hours of good air
How long does it take to get to the cave?
About three and a half hours
You okay?
Yeah sure
No
Me neither
Relax boys
We'll hear worse than
that before we hit the bottom
So your father really made it down
to the World Beneath?
I. There and back in this very submarine
How come your not a rich man
They wouldn't let him return
The scaley's didn't like the idea of
having their sacred place found
so they confiscated his journal
burned it to ashes and locked him away
But before he died he pulled me up
very close and said to me
"Dennison also kept a journal
" I've spent my whole life searching
for that journal
After he died they found hundreds
of small notes
They all said the same thing
"l found it!"
Sunstones!
Block it, boys, block it!! Come on!
You have to go faster than that
With out the prime sunstone
all the others will fail
This maybe the end for Dinotopia
What are we to do?
The citizens are already gathering
in Fountain Square
by the Opilish codes
Well you lead the city
in a prayer of hope
Of course, but why me?
The sunstone I gave you was small
but it was an almost perfect gem
Show it to the city
It will bring hope and then we can
take it to the Sunstone Tower
and perhaps it will bring back the light
for one night at least
I don't have it anymore
I gave it to David and
Karl to power the submarine
You gave those two the most flawless
sunstone ever found
I thought it was the
Dinotopian thing to do
I only hope it was worth
all our lives, Marion
Maybe we should turn on a light
and see where we are
And we'll drain the power
We don't want it to soon
What was that?
The sea bed boys
We're making progress
It's getting really hot in here
And hard to breathe
That's our plane
Prepare yourself for an ugly sight boys
There won't be much left of him by now
The fish would....
If you don't shut up
I am going to hit you
Seen a few drowners in my time
That's all I'm saying
no offence to the died
It's empty!
What? It can't be
There it is boys
We have got to hit the entrance
just right
Come on
Fresh air! Finally!
Come on boys no time to waste
Welcome to the south entrance
to the World Beneath
This is Ogthar
Half man, half scaley
Founder of Poseidos
If you believe that kind of rubbish
So how do you get half-man half-dinosaur?
I don't think it's meant to be literal
It's symbolic
Humans and dinosaurs sharing
the same thoughts and desires
Living together in perfect harmony
I'm with Karl on that one
All looks a bit mucky to me
You can't just dismiss
an amazing agricultural discovery
because it looks "a bit mucky"
Once a scaley always a scaley
Path splits up ahead
Let's have a look at Dennison's journal
"We walked almost a mile underground
due south...
"lt was back the way we'd come
under the mainland
and I began to realize
that the World Beneath ran the length
and breath of Dinotopia...
I followed left for a hundred feet
and then came to - the old North Gate
where the Code of Dinotopia was
first carved into solid rock..."
Over there!
This is where the monument
in Fountain Square came from
So that must be the code
The first three letters were F-l-N--
Well that's a --D. F-l-N-D
Find the light
Look at this boys
Look at that!
They carved their whole history of???
our history
It's all right here
This is one of those theories, right?
That dinosaurs were wiped out by a meteor
And the meteor caused a tidal wave--
It looks like the end of the world...
Well that must be
the sunstone cave
It became like some kind of ark
It saved them.
Scaley history
Come on, we're near
The ancient scrolls warned us
of such a time
But we must not give up hope Marion
Maybe when we least expect it
help will come
Sunstone fragments!
This must be it
We're looking for something
a bit bigger than that, pal
This way
But the journal says Dennison
walked due north
about a quarter of a mile
That's north
But he stayed on the main path
didn't he?
Come on
Maybe we should split up
we'll cover more ground that way
That's right. Lets all split up
And if you get lost
how are you going to find your way back?
I say we follow the main path
Alright. Come on
I think we are lost
No need for that
Come look what I found
This is it we found the light
This is it
This is everything
It's unreal, is it not?
It looks like something
from another planet
Of course your right
The temple pictures make sense now
The dinosaurs didn't find
the sunstone cave
The meteor that hit the earth
that is the Sunstone Cave
Come on boys. Lets get all these loaded
Time is running out
for our friends upstairs
It's the end, isn't it?
I believe it is
I've always said I would never seek
another partner
after the death of my beloved
But if I ever was it could only be you
I am. And always will be
your truest friend
Breath deep, ZlPEAU
Seek peace, Marion
Hurry up. Hurry up
Careful
That should do it boys
You know
I don't think we can take all of these
Cyrus, we're too heavy
He's right, it's too dangerous
You're going to have to
make a second trip
I don't think
she has a second trip in her
Something will have to go
What do you mean?
Well let me put it his way
I don't want to risk loosing
our precious cargo
So something will have to go
But I don't think
it will be the sunstones
You can't be serious
I'd like to thank you gentlemen
for all your hard work
But if you'll excuse me
I'll be taking my leave
Cyrus, you are not
leaving us down here
Davie
What are you going to do?It's...
I knew we couldn't trust you
A little boxing match, yeah?
Well I don't think so
Because I'm a street fighter
and I always win
Dad?
Dad!
Well, well
well all this time in alone
in a cave and still alive
Yeah, well it's time to say Good Bye
You're not going anywhere
KARL!
Don't make me do something worse !!!
Don't be crazy! Just let him go!
Good idea
Hope you enjoy your family reunion
cheerio!
How did you get here? I saw you drown
I nearly did drown
I finally managed to break free
When the plane hit the ocean floor
I thought I was swimming for the surface
but I came out here instead
What did you do for food?
All in good time..
I'll tell you everything...
First off I want to hear about you two
There's plenty of time to hear about me
Sorry, did I hurt you? Are you okay?
I can't believe it
seeing you both again
its like magic
When I heard your voices, I thought..
this is it, I've gotten weak
I'm beginning to hallucinate..
this is the end..
Well you kind of surprised us, too
Dad. We thought...
God I missed you.
Missed you too.
Both of you...
You've changed...
but you're different... and
look at you, David....
I couldn't believe it...
Facing down that guy, like that
who ever he was
- Cyrus Crabb -
Come on...
Come on...
Now Karl, let's get you up..
Come on..
..I know this is only a flesh wound
but it's gonna hurt, okay?
..Come on, lean on me...
No damnit!...
I just don't have the strength
I used to have
Are you alright?
Yeah
Now all we have to do is get out of here
Yeah but how are we going to do that?
Cyrus just took the only way out
Well, he's not going very far
Not without any gas
ARRGH!!!
Oh no, not like this..
Well that's it then. No more Cyrus
And no more boat
There must be another way out of here
By the sacred code, Pteranodons
Everyone gather together
Come on, stay with me
Come on. keep up, keep up
Come on get in, get in, get in
Oliver!
Karl, I told you, I already looked
Dennison and Lee Crabb
left the same way they came
in the submarine
There was nothing in the journal
about any other way out
That doesn't mean there isn't one
Dad, how much of this place
have you seen?
How much have I seen? I don't know
I've walked maybe two
three hundred miles
in these caves
it's hard to say
Some of them I couldn't get through
because of the bats
but No, there's no way out...
None...trust me...
I would have found it by now
if there was
Dad? Is there another way out
of this place?
This is it
Wait a minute
This is the flare I dropped
into the well, remember
Right so...
Temple in the swamp
This must be the other end
We can get out!
Well that's great
Dad what's wrong?
Must be hundreds of feet
to the surface...
The way I see it
we don't have a choice
He's right
we don't
You go ahead, bring back help
What are you talking about?
There is no other way of getting back
This is our last chance.
There is no way
I'm going into the water again
I can't do it
Yes, you can
We can't go without you
I can't do it..Listen I'm scared, OK
It's the simple truth
I can't..I'm scared
Dad.. you never get scared
Would you listen to me!
I can't go back into the water. OK!
I don't think you have any idea
to come this close to drowning
I don't ever want to go through
that again
OK, I can't
Dad, Dad look at me, look at me
You spent all that time alone
in the dark
thinking you'd never see
or hear another human being again
That would break most men
Not you
You survived and you held on
And I think you're the bravest man
I've ever known
Now this, it's nothing to
what you went through
And this time we can
get through it together
Alright
Here
You can hold your breath for longer
than any of us. Remember?
This will light the way
We can do this. Right
We'll just count to three
and then take a deep breath. OK?
One....
Two, Three!!!
Karl? Are you OK?
Yeah
I can't believe we did it
Yeah, we did it
We found the gateway
the gateway to the World Beneath
And the sunstone cave
I don't understand
Dad, you're a hero
Are you, OK?
Yeah
Oh and Dad, don't put your foot
in the water
Why not?
You don't want to know....
What is that?
Dad, it's all right! It's Free-fall!
It's what?
Stay here. Karl, look out for Dad
I've got to get back to the city
I'll send for help
David!
Please wake up,Oh dear!
In recognition of the remarkable courage
you have demonstrated in our darkest hour
we present you with this symbol
of our gratitude
and request that you and your steed
Free-fall join the Skybax Squadron
Well done, David!
Thank you
I'd like permission to join the search
for my father and brother
Of course
The Skybax patrols
and all of the earthfarm riders
are out searching for them now
But preliminary reports showed no signs
of anyone at the temple, David
But that's impossible
I assure you
I will expend every effort
to find your brother and father
and will not rest until they are safe
Who's that?
Twenty-six! Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
Marion, I'd like you
to meet my father
Frank Scott
Very nice to meet you
It's very nice to meet you to, Marion
You have to forgive me
I'm a little overwhelmed by everything
that's been happening to me
You must be Mr. Scott
I've heard so much about you
Is he safe?
It's OK, Dad
He's not going to bite you
I'm sorry
My name is ZlPEAU Stenosaurus
It's an absolute pleasure
to meet you, Sir
It's nice to meet you too
Mr. Stenosaurus
Oh, ZlPEAU. Please
You have no idea
what a pleasure it gives me
to meet the father of these
two fine young men
I always believed in these boys
didn't I Rosemary?
Yes, you definitely did, dear
We all owe a huge debt of gratitude
to these two fine young men
David Scott, you ride the skybax
with the same courage
and grace as the great Gideon Altaire
And you, Karl Scott
will be reinstated as the
Chasmasours' legal guardian
Never again must we rest on our laurels
as we sacrifice progress to tradition
You have brought
a new vision to Dinotopia
Thank you, Lord Mayor. Dad....
David, you were right
The gateway to the World Beneath
is open again
We found the light!!!
