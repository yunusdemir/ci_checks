Oh, shit.
Oh, shit. No, no. No.
Oh, my God.
Kristin.
Kristin.
Mama?
Mama?
Mama, where are you?
Kristin.
- Kristin. Kristin...
- Mama. Mama. Mama.
It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.
I promise, it's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.
What?
He's behind you.
You defy a god.
<i>You defy a god.</i>
<i>You defy a god.</i>
Where are you?
Where are you?
Come on!
Punishment must fit the transgression.
What do you mean, <i>pendejo?</i>
This isn't real. This is a construct.
Everything you've seen is real.
They're all dead.
I recorded it for you to relive.
How many times have I done this?
Quite a few. But we are far from done.
I erase it and we start again.
No. No. No.
<i>No!</i>
No.
This is a construct.
How many times have I done this?
Not nearly enough.
No.
No.
Let me out!
Do you hear me?
Can anyone hear me? Let me out!
Let me out!
Tak!
There are no guns on this ship
except mine.
Don't.
Triggered against a stack,
those batons have enough current
to cause mental damage.
A few seconds longer, real death,
so I suggest you stay still.
Shit.
It's true.
Damn Ava Elliot.
It's all my idea.
She's doing what I asked.
Don't think for a second
you haven't broken my
heart by doing it.
Do I sound the alarm?
Alert the ship's staff?
No.
We give his people no warning
he's been caught.
Trace the satellite hack.
If it came from that hotel,
I want that AI reduced to nanodust.
Bring the others here.
- Rei, just listen to me.
- Why?
You never listened to me.
When you joined the Protectorate,
when the yakuza bought me,
even when you said yes to the Envoys,
you made all the decisions.
It ends here.
The pulse blew out everything.
It's not rebooting. I
can't get a signal.
- I know.
- Then why are you not worried?
Because I skipped over worry
- and went straight to full-on panic.
- Huh.
Are you sure that the dip went through?
Yeah. I burnt that bitch down.
You should not have done that.
Why didn't your sensors tell you
that I had come inside?
Perhaps there's a malfunction
in your systems?
What...
is happening?
Electron destabilizer.
No.
Miss Elizabeth?
Ah.
They're killing me in the real.
You cannot stay here.
They will come for you.
They were always coming.
Give me your hand.
I'll send you onto the Array.
- You'll be safe.
- No.
- No time to argue.
- I'll go, but I don't run away anymore.
I run toward.
Send me up to the sky.
- I cannot let you...
- I know the tree now,
the branches spreading
in every direction.
And I can see them all.
Als are easy to kill
with the right tools.
If you don't send me, they catch me.
What is it that you see?
Salvation.
Death.
Mickey!
You shot him through the stack,
you son of a bitch!
Retribution.
Perhaps you could tell me
in what order?
It's time for you to send me away.
- I can't.
- You can.
You do.
You already have.
You gave me so much.
Whatever it means to be human, Eddie...
you are.
You don't deserve to be called human,
you despicable creature.
And you are a dead machine walking.
Mmm-mmm.
Then I will see you in hell.
I'm sending your mind
to Head in the Clouds.
Be careful, Lizzie.
You shouldn't be afraid for me.
You should be afraid for the monsters.
"And neither the angels
in heaven above,"
nor the demons down under the sea,
<i>can ever dissever my soul</i>
"from the soul of the beautiful..."
Whose stack is this?
I should say "was."
DHF is dark. No one's in here.
Whoever this was,
you won't be seeing them again.
Let's go.
Hey!
There's no one on the roster
to boot up in a synth tonight.
You're not supposed to be in there.
Let me guess.
Your boyfriend wants you
in some premium silicone?
Hmm?
It's Braeman in engineering, isn't it?
Yeah.
I'm not gonna report you.
I always wanted to try one of these out.
Hey. I don't like that look.
You act like you want it.
Oh, honey, you don't like this model?
I can be anyone you want.
No. Let me through!
Tanaka!
I need to talk to...
I need to talk to you.
- Can't go by here, ma'am.
- Please!
This is a crime scene.
You've got no business here.
Not with me. Not anymore.
Because they still pay you?
Still think you're better than me.
Careful.
Or what? I'll fall from grace?
That's what you're
worried about, right?
That you'll lose what you've got?
Your safety, your job, your life.
Let me tell you, Captain,
you already have.
I think you're confusing
me with yourself.
I came here to try to
do the right thing.
Now, I know you have no reason
to trust me,
but I believe you have
a core of decency
and I am trying to find mine.
Whatever you want from me...
I can't.
Get her out of here.
I know where she is,
because I know who has her.
All you have to do is ask me.
Ask me where Ortega is.
Hey. Hey. It's okay. Hey. Hey.
- Hey.
- Kovacs?
Kristin... Kristin...
- I'll fucking kill you!
- No!
You bitch!
- Let go of me!
- I'll do whatever you want.
Good. Choose which one of them
gets their stack blown out.
Or I'll have them all killed right now.
- Don't do this.
- I'm not going to.
- You are.
- What?
There's one bullet.
One.
Choose.
This isn't about them. It's about us.
You made it about them.
It's time for you to evolve.
Transformation is always painful.
But I changed to make myself stronger.
You can, too.
All you have to do is pick one.
<i>This is real power.</i>
Cutting away the things
that make you weak one at a time.
Embrace that power.
Be on the winning side.
Let 'em go...
or you'll lose everything.
Come back to me, Tak.
Please...
You won't do it.
Wait. Please!
You think I'd give you a loaded gun?
You'd risk your life for them?
You think you love her, don't you?
I can't stand this fucking asshole.
Right. You're hopelessly unavailable
and doomed to die.
You really do have a type.
- So I'll kill her first.
- No, no. Wait, wait.
Don't.
Okay.
Okay. I'll stay.
It'll just be the two of us.
Just like it was.
Just let 'em go.
It's a start.
Take them away.
I'm saving them for you.
You're gonna kill each one of them.
And by the time you do,
you won't even care.
Who are you?
I paid for this floor to be clear.
I didn't dial for the S and M package.
Although, maybe I'll
just take it anyway.
It's on the house.
I've done everything I can
to try and get you to understand.
I've acted like the little girl
you miss so much.
I'm out of patience.
- Fight and your fireflies pay.
- What are you doing?
Taking out that wirecam.
No one's ever gonna see that recording.
And while we're at it,
let's get rid of that sleeve.
- No.
- I'm a Meth.
We take what we want, when we want.
Like the Ortega children?
They were raw material.
A means to an end
to get the respect I'm owed.
They were kids. Just like we were.
You think I wear this
because I miss her?
I don't miss her.
I hate her.
Mom was weak. She deserved to die.
I keep this as a reminder
never to be like her.
Rei-<i>chan...</i>
Don't call me that. I'm not that
pathetic little girl anymore.
I killed her...
and became something stronger.
- Faster.
- Can't go faster.
- You fucking stabbed...
- He's bleeding. Okay? He's hurt.
All pain is instructional.
It warns you, "Don't do this."
Perhaps you should have listened.
You're not authorized to be in
this area. Return to your room.
Get to Kovacs! Go!
Oh, my God.
Lizzie?
I'm gonna show you how much I love you.
I'm sorry for all the
times I failed you.
I'm gonna eat you up.
Hold him still.
This ship, I'm going to kill it.
All the systems
run through these terminals.
She's gonna cut the main power
and the backups,
and we have to throw all three relays
at the same moment.
The Elliots are gonna bring
this fucker down.
Flip the switches when I say.
Ready? Steady? Go.
Kovacs!
<i>Warning.</i>
<i>This aircraft has suffered
a catastrophic power loss.</i>
<i>Please evacuate.</i>
No more dead children.
Who's gonna stop me?
<i>This aircraft will begin</i>
<i>to lose altitude in
less than ten minutes.</i>
<i>Please evacuate immediately.</i>
Your mother prayed to
God when she died.
Where's your God now?
You'll meet him
soon enough, you bastard.
I'll kill you before I let you put me
in a cage.
Everybody off this ship!
- <i>Warning.</i>
- Let's go. Move!
<i>This aircraft will begin
to lose altitude...</i>
...<i>in five minutes.</i>
Don't!
He's mine.
What are you doing?
You're bought and paid for.
Not today.
No, please.
My mother prayed to God,
and he put you in my arms.
Please.
So tell me...
are you a believer, motherfucker?
Kovacs!
Kovacs! Can you hear me?
- Kovacs!
- Reileen Kawahara!
Open the door! BCPD!
- You are under arrest!
- Kovacs, can you hear me?
- Can you hear me?
- Get back. Get back.
They'll never get in.
Then we stay here.
We crash, but you'll still stand trial.
I'm not going on ice.
<i>Warning.</i>
<i>This aircraft will begin
to lose altitude...</i>
<i>...in three minutes.</i>
Help me.
We can make it out to the hull,
over to the escape pods.
You might as well shoot me.
Help me and I'll give you back Quell.
What?
I backed her up.
Right before the explosion.
She didn't even know.
It's the unanswered question.
The mystery that needs to be solved.
Where is she?
Her DHF is hidden.
You'll never find her without me.
You can have her back.
Everything she knew,
everything she was,
right up to the last moment.
You saw me.
You heard me.
Because deep in your mind...
I always knew.
Help me escape and she's yours.
I can't.
You can't.
Do what I say
or you'll never get her back.
Never see her again.
You've become everything
we fought against.
Go on. Do it.
I'll never stop.
I'll never stop.
Kovacs!
No. No. Kovacs!
Kovacs, fucking answer me! Answer me!
Kovacs?
- Kovacs?
- Kristin?
Goodbye.
Oh, God. Oh, God.
Listen to me.
Listen to me,
you've gotta get out of there.
You've gotta get out of there.
I'm staying with her.
<i>This aircraft
will begin to lose altitude in</i>
- <i>one minute.</i>
- Come on. Come on, get out of there.
Please, open the door. Please? Come on.
Please just make it worth something.
I'm not leaving without you. Come on.
Kristin, go!
No!
- Come on.
- No!
She was my sister...
and I loved her.
She lost her path.
But in her own way, she loved you back.
<i>Warning.
This aircraft is now losing altitude.</i>
<i>â™ª The Patchwork Man â™ª
â™ª Will crack your bones â™ª</i>
<i>â™ª The Patchwork Man â™ª</i>
<i>â™ª The Patchwork Man â™ª</i>
I'll stay, Tak.
I'll always be with you.
Tell me a story.
Something that doesn't end
in death and tragedy.
Long ago,
and worlds away,
there was a young princess,
orphaned in a time of war.
<i>She was called upon
to lead the armies of her kingdom,</i>
<i>for there was no other.</i>
<i>She was the fiercest of warriors,</i>
<i>beloved of her people,
unstoppable on the field.</i>
<i>She rode out every day
and saved her subjects</i>
<i>in battle after battle.</i>
<i>But every night,
when the fighting was done,</i>
<i>she was alone.</i>
<i>Until one day, a peasant boy came
looking to join her army.</i>
<i>Lonely and angry and fierce as she.</i>
<i>For the first time,</i>
<i>she found that when she strode out</i>
<i>onto the field to save others,</i>
<i>there was someone at her side
who had come to save her.</i>
<i>Then there came
the darkest battle of the war.</i>
<i>The princess and her peasant boy stood,
side by side,</i>
<i>and vowed that they would be separated</i>
<i>by nothing less than death itself.</i>
<i>She fell to an enemy sword...</i>
<i>and died before his eyes.</i>
<i>And those who heard the story cried
for the death of love.</i>
This is an unusual situation, Mr.
Kovacs.
We were able to pull your stack
from the wreckage in the bay,
but your sleeve was killed on impact.
So that's why we're in virtual.
That's part of what's unusual.
Your counterpart has refused
to be debriefed in the real.
Well, I've been on an
island getting laid
and he crashed and died,
so the least I could do
was share the same shitty
virtual questioning.
- It's a solidarity thing.
- That would be exactly the problem.
Although there's a pardon
for Takeshi Kovacs,
it's only for one of you.
The UN has taken over
this investigation
due to the sensitive nature
of what you've uncovered,
and while we're grateful
for the service you've both
done for the Protectorate
in exposing this criminal activity...
We can't allow two Kovacs DHFs
to survive. It's illegal.
So one of us has gotta die.
It'll be your decision.
- Together.
- All right, let me talk to him.
And I choose the construct.
The look on her face.
The look on her face
when I pulled the trigger.
It was almost relief.
Maybe she realized what she'd become.
A way for her to let go.
You saw her eyes.
Could you tell?
I don't know.
And I don't think I ever will.
We gotta decide whose memories to keep,
yours or mine.
That's a funny way to ask
which one of us is gonna die.
Play for it?
Rock, paper, scissors?
Eternal rest grant unto them, O Lord.
Let perpetual light shine upon them.
May their souls
and all the souls of the departed...
through the mercy of God...
rest in peace.
Amen.
How?
I was double-sleeved.
One of us died.
Which one are you?
The one you said goodbye to.
- Mmm.
- It's beautiful, Miriam. Stunning.
I can't believe that I am looking
at the fossil of an actual Elder.
Mmm-hmm.
It makes you wonder if memories
of Elder civilization
are what gave us the idea for angels.
<i>He slagged his own stack.</i>
<i>He has an archaic streak.
You'd call it honor.</i>
<i>The fool wanted to forget,</i>
<i>as if that would make him clean
of what he'd done.</i>
<i>Explosive allegations implicating
Laurens Bancroft,</i>
<i>Meth mogul and one of the richest men
of the Settled Worlds,</i>
<i>in murder and sleeve death.</i>
<i>The crash last week of Head in
the Clouds, one of the Houses,</i>
<i>is said to be related.</i>
<i>It's alleged Bancroft killed himself</i>
<i>in an attempt to escape feeling guilt
for his crime,</i>
<i>but not until after
he illegally influenced</i>
<i>the members of the UN Court
to defeat Resolution 653.</i>
<i>Pressure is mounting in the court
to reconsider 653,</i>
<i>which would allow victims
to testify against their killers,</i>
<i>even if they have religious coding
on their stacks.</i>
Laurens, whatever you've done...
I'll stand by you.
I...
I may be many things,
but I am not a murderer.
Of course.
Prescott didn't kill you.
Get out.
You were alone in this room.
You weren't insane. Just a coward.
No.
No, I know who I am.
And in essence, I am a decent man.
You're about to be arrested
for the real death of Lena Rentang.
I don't even know who that is.
That's 'cause you blew out your
own stack to forget about her.
So this criminal Kawahara woman
makes up a story and
it gets on the feeds.
No one will believe it.
They'll believe Mary Lou Henchy.
See, Reileen had her stack,
and they just pulled it out of the bay.
As soon as 653 moves forward,
Mary Lou's gonna talk.
I mean, even if you're right,
that I real death'd that girl...
the person who did that is dead.
I destroyed him.
You erased the memory, not the act.
This cannot be the man I am.
You lived too long.
I believed...
I believed I had a line
I would not cross.
I believed I had a conscience.
To put a gun to your own head
when you want to live...
that takes the will of a demon.
You thought you were a god.
You're more like the devil himself.
Sir, police are waiting downstairs.
Look after the family, Isaac.
I'll leave everything to you.
As I should have done, a long time ago.
I surrender myself
for the crimes I have committed.
We're not done here.
Right, Miriam?
What?
- What's he talking about, darling?
- I certainly have no idea.
Haven't you done enough, Mr. Kovacs?
- What is this person doing in my house?
- Lizzie?
Say what you came to say.
For the longest time,
I couldn't remember what happened to me.
I couldn't even speak.
But I can now.
I got pregnant.
I came up here to tell you,
but you weren't here.
She was.
- Whore.
- You watch what you say to my daughter!
You hit me and you kicked me
and you kept kicking me.
I remember it all.
That's a lie.
Oh, my God.
I only wanted to talk to her.
I offered her money.
I offered her anything she wanted,
if she'd just get rid of it.
I got angry.
It was an accident.
You took my baby from me!
You had to have her stopped
from getting spun back up.
You asked me to get you a fixer.
So I got you the best.
So Reileen took her
to the Wei Clinic, drove her crazy,
and dumped her in an alley.
The cops didn't care
about another sleeve-dead hooker,
so no one found out about the baby.
Oh, for God's sake, Miriam.
You don't understand.
The children are all I have.
The children are mine!
But then Reileen wanted something back,
so she had you drug your husband.
It was you?
It was you who betrayed me?
Don't you talk to me about betrayal.
You did this to me.
We have ruined each other.
Haven't we?
Miriam Bancroft, you're under arrest
for the sleeve death
of Elizabeth Elliot
and the forcible termination
of her pregnancy against her will.
<i>Ava Elliot was pardoned.</i>
<i>I paid off her sleeve mortgage,
and got her her real body back.</i>
<i>Lizzie kept the synth.</i>
<i>When anyone asks her why, she says,
"Because it's not real."</i>
<i>And she doesn't know if she is, either.</i>
<i>653 passed. The dead could
now accuse their murderers.</i>
<i>The world changed. For all of us.</i>
- There's nothing left to unpack.
- Really?
We can't be done.
- Do you think he'll like it?
- Ryker?
He's a lucky guy.
You're the reason why he was cleared.
That's not luck.
He was cleared 'cause he was innocent.
He deserves to get his life back.
Everything he lost.
And after you turn Ryker's sleeve in...
where will you go?
I don't know.
I don't know anything...
except that she's still alive.
Good luck, Takeshi Kovacs.
<i>After his princess died,</i>
<i>the peasant boy wandered the world...</i>
<i>lost to despair.</i>
<i>Until one day, he came upon an immortal</i>
<i>who told him his princess
had been stolen,</i>
<i>trapped in an enchantment.</i>
<i>So now he seeks her,
across this world and every other.</i>
<i>Because somewhere,</i>
<i>sealed behind frozen glass
and thick walls of deadly thorns,</i>
<i>she sleeps...</i>
<i>waiting to be awakened.</i>
<i>And someday, without fail,
he will find her.</i>
