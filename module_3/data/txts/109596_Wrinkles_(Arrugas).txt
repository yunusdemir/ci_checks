I'll be honest.
With this kind of income,
I'm afraid I cannot approve your mortgage.
If you'd like,
I can put you in touch with someone...
I can't take this any more!
I know I said I'd try to be patient,
but I'm sick of this every time we come here.
For once, could you just do what we ask
and stop playing these silly games?
We don't have time for it today.
Sit back down, sir.
In over 20 years as a bank manager,
I've never had...
Enough, Dad! We aren't in a bank.
You haven't even worked in one in years!
I'm not looking for a loan.
I just want you to finish your damn soup.
My soup?
Look at the time. Late again.
That's just great. Another ruined night.
I give up. We're never going to make it now.
Tell Julian he can give the tickets
to whoever he wants.
I knew this would happen.
Calm down, Juan,
they can leave the tickets for us
at the box office.
What for? By the time he's finished eating,
it will be over!
It's just a show. Your father needs us.
But I can't constantly
rearrange my life for him.
I've finished my soup.
You can go.
Payments are made on a monthly basis.
If there's ever anything you need,
you can call this number
and someone will be able to assist you.
All that's left is your signature, right there.
We'll take good care of him
and make sure he gets the care he needs.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
I'm new. My name's Emilio.
I'm new. My name's Emilio.
That's great, Dad,
you've already made some new friends.
I get the feeling
you're going to have a great time here.
Hey, this is better
than that old apartment, right?
And it's got people your own age.
Well, we have to get going now.
We'll come to visit really soon, okay, Dad?
Take care.
Goodbye, Emilio, see you soon.
- Goodbye, son.
- Goodbye, son.
Goodbye, son.
Goodbye, son.
Goodbye, son. Goodbye, son.
All right, Ramon, I think we all heard you.
I think we all heard you.
You must be Emilio?
Come with me. I can take you to your room.
Yes, thank you.
Let me grab your suitcase.
No, that's okay. I can carry it.
It's no trouble. Come with me.
Come with me. Come with me.
Come with me. Come with me.
I want to go back with Mommy.
- He wants his mommy.
- Are you scared?
Miss your mommy?
You want to go home?
Here we are. Go on in.
I'll find Miguel, your roommate.
Make yourself at home.
Okay, thank you.
I'll wait here.
<i>That's why I'm sad and lonely</i>
Greetings, fellow inmate!
What do you think of our cell?
How many years they got you in for?
How many years?
Let me guess.
You're a lifer like the rest of us, eh?
Name is Miguel.
Guess you're the new roommate.
I'm Emilio. It's very nice to meet you.
So, how long have you been a resident?
Been calling Calusa Harbour my home
for two years now.
Let's just say I needed a break
from living Ia <i>vida loca.</i>
So you're a voluntary inmate?
Be waited on hand and foot,
what could be better?
Honestly, though, it's not so bad.
The staff here takes pretty good care of you.
And I never have to wash another dish again.
Anyway, I can tell you
the story of my life later.
They asked me to show you
around the place.
Unless you'd rather unpack first,
or take a nap, or something.
No, no, that's quite all right.
I'd rather take the tour now.
- Okay.
- Great!
Come on, you're just in time for strip bingo.
Strip bingo?
I'm only kidding. Bingo's on Tuesday nights.
Before I forget,
the office said to collect 10 bucks from you.
Something about there still being
an outstanding balance in your account.
Balance? What balance?
They never mentioned that to me.
I don't know. I try not to ask
too many questions about these things.
Just hope they don't charge you a late fee.
Well, you know, I used to be a bank manager.
So I know all about late fees.
You're kidding.
We got ourselves a bank man?
No one told me I'd be rooming
with a Rockefeller.
No. Well, I was just a local branch manager.
Nothing to write home about.
A manager's still a manager. Am I right?
You could be running
this whole operation before long.
But really, what do I know?
I'm a few pennies shy of a dollar
up in here, if you know what I mean.
But, listen, about that 10 bucks,
I think it's best you give it to me now.
I might forget about it later, you know?
Of course. Cash okay?
I should have a 10 in here somewhere.
That'll be perfect. Good.
Follow me, Rockefeller, let's start your tour.
My name is Emilio!
It's Emilio.
This here's the main room.
The palpitating heart of the residence.
Good luck finding a seat between meal times.
Officially, it's the panoramic room.
But everyone calls it the fishbowl.
I see. So it's like a waiting room.
A waiting room.
It's like a waiting room. It's like a...
Settle down, Ramon,
or you'll wake everybody up.
Wake everybody up.
You'll wake everybody up.
This is Ramon the DJ,
one of our more talkative residents.
Yes, yes. We've already had the pleasure of...
- Talking.
- Had the pleasure.
Ramon is our resident celebrity.
He used to host a radio talk show.
He was very opinionated.
But lately he's run out
of original things to say.
- Very opinionated.
- Very good, Ramon.
That's right.
Well, we should keep going.
There's still plenty more to see.
There's plenty more to see.
There's plenty more to see.
There's plenty more to see.
The dining room.
The library.
The men's room.
Not to be confused with the ladies' room,
over there.
And the doctor.
If you need your prostate checked,
he's your guy.
The infirmary.
This is where they stash the drugs
to keep us doped up.
You are terrible, Miguel.
Morning, Rosie! How are you?
Administration.
If you're in there, it means you're in trouble.
The main entrance. If you want to escape,
go right through those doors.
I hope you like watching television,
there's not much else to do around here.
To be honest,
I've never been interested in nature shows.
I'd rather watch sports.
Well, this is all they ever show here.
Why doesn't someone change the channel?
I don't know. I guess the staff
wants us to watch something peaceful.
<i>...cycles occur every 25 to 30 days,</i>
<i>and follow a violent ritual
of sexual cannibalism,</i>
<i>where a male places his abdomen over the...</i>
Shall we continue?
The gymnasium.
Oh, no, I didn't bring my tracksuit.
The fact that you own a tracksuit
puts you miles ahead of the rest of us.
I wouldn't worry about it.
And we've saved the best for last.
The swimming pool.
I didn't bring my swimming suit.
It doesn't matter.
It's not like you're going to use it.
It's only here so they can impress the clients.
The clients?
You know, the ones who pay the bills.
Your children. The government.
They are the residency's real clients,
not you or me.
The swimming pool's here for them,
to look nice in a brochure
so they can think this is a five-star hotel.
A swimming pool? It's like some cruel joke.
Most of the people here
can't even shower on their own.
I've loved swimming since I was a kid.
My parents had a place on the ocean
and when they passed away,
they left the house to me.
My wife and I
would take our son there every summer.
I can't believe
I haven't been swimming since.
I bet they'd give you the key
if you asked for it.
You'd definitely have the place
all to yourself.
That'd be nice. It would be good
to get back in the water again.
And that's pretty much it.
If you need anything, just ask.
I can get you whatever you want.
You name it.
Swimming trunks...
Do you know where I can find a telephone?
Good morning, Mrs Grace.
I need to call my two boys.
They'll be happy that I'm all better now.
I need them to pick me up.
Where's a telephone?
There's one down the hall in reception.
- Will they let me use it?
- Sure, no problem.
What do you think it's there for?
Why don't you pay me for it now,
and then you can go ahead
and just call your boys?
Of course.
Once I call, they'll come pick me up.
I'm all better, you see.
Is this enough?
Yes, this is fine. No problem.
Head down the hall to reception
and ask for the telephone there.
Yes, the telephone.
I have to call my sons
to come and pick me up
because I'm all better now.
I thought you told me
reception is over there?
It is, but there's no need
to worry about it, Rockefeller.
She spends her clays
wandering the halls looking for a telephone,
but she never calls anyone.
You see, by the time
she makes it to reception,
she'll have forgotten about why
she went there in the first place.
It's better this way.
They wouldn't let her use the phone anyway.
Hello?
Hello?
Miguel?
Somebody help me.
There you are, Rockefeller.
Oh, my goodness. It's just you.
I'm sorry. You gave me quite a start there.
It's okay, Rockefeller. Calm down.
Don't have a heart attack now.
You only got here less than an hour ago.
It's far too soon to check out.
Yeah, I know.
But the truth is,
with everything I've seen today,
it's been a bit of a shock.
Just now I heard all sorts of strange noises.
What's up there?
Upstairs?
It's the land of lost souls.
What do you mean, "lost souls"?
You know, for the ones
who can't cope on their own any more.
The ones suffering from
dementia or from Alzheimer's.
The ones who've lost their marbles.
You don't want to go up there.
It's not a pretty sight.
Come on, we better go.
They serve dinner early here.
Everyone meet Emilio,
he's my new roommate.
- Nice to meet you.
- This is Antonia.
Pleased to meet you.
So glad you'll be joining us.
And Dolores and Modesto.
- It's a pleasure.
- Likewise.
So tell me, Emilio.
How do you like your new home?
Isn't it nice?
Yes, very nice.
Everything's quite modern here.
Although I haven't quite adjusted yet.
They stuck you with Miguel,
which means at the very least
you won't die of boredom.
Don't worry, you'll get used to it here.
Everybody's very friendly.
By the way, Dolores,
have you signed up for the trip yet?
The one to the casino?
We haven't decided yet.
It all depends on
if they're going to be providing lunch.
All right, I have meds for Dolores,
Modesto, Miguel and Antonia.
Do you think
you can give me something for my leg?
- I would like some also.
- And maybe you could give me...
- Actually, make it two.
-...something from your special stash?
We've been through this.
No goodies without a prescription.
You want meds, you talk to the doc.
Hey, Marco Polo. Say hi to Emilio.
He's my new roommate.
Marco is one of the nurses here.
He's a nice guy, even if he does
wear his hair in pigtails.
They're dreadlocks, Miguel.
Dreadlocks? That sounds bad.
Can't the doctor
give you something for them?
Stop. At least he still has hair.
Anyway, this is for Modesto.
- And Dolores...
- Thank you.
- Antonia's.
- Thank you, Marco.
And these are yours, Emilio.
These are for me?
You already know my medication?
Of course. We have all your records.
- We take care of everything for you here.
- Okay.
They're really well organised.
And these are yours, Miguel.
Yeah, especially when it comes
to doping us up.
Hey, Dreadlocks! You went and screwed up
my medication again.
- What? Are you sure?
- Yeah.
You keep forgetting to include my Viagra.
For Christ's sake!
That's the last thing you need.
Good one. You got me.
Can I take that?
Yes, please.
Thank you.
The desserts are so good.
They're my favourite.
Are you kidding me?
How can you eat that crap?
I wouldn't feed it to a dog.
Who makes dessert without sugar?
Never mind him.
It's quite tasty and very healthy.
Healthy?
Do I look like I care about my figure?
What I want is a nice steak, a gin martini,
some cheesecake.
At our age, what difference does it make?
If it's a bacon cheeseburger that does me in,
I'll consider myself one of the lucky ones.
Oh, dear. All better.
Emilio.
Sorry.
I was asking.
Are you going to eat your butter?
- No, no. Please, it's all yours.
- Thank you.
Jesus, will you look at them?
You'd think Lawrence Welk
was handing out hard candies.
That's the same thing every night.
What are they doing?
There aren't enough nurses,
so they have to line up
to get helped into bed.
It's not even 6:00, for Christ's sake.
Then why don't they just
do something else in the meantime?
Something else?
All we do around here is eat, sleep and poop.
Some of us are still eating, Miguel!
Emilio.
- Emilio.
- What?
Are you going to eat your jam?
Go ahead. You can have it.
Thank you.
- You weren't going to use this tea, were you?
- No, no, no.
Look at Miguel. He's at it again.
Of course. Is this enough?
Sorry, I had a bit of business to take care of.
What? She has plenty of money
and couldn't care less about it.
Miguel, we all see what you're doing.
Taking advantage of Grace
'cause her head's not right.
No. What are you talking about?
I'm doing her a favour.
If it weren't for me,
she wouldn't have anything to do all day.
Sure, a favour.
So you keep on taking money from her
out of the kindness of your heart?
Now, hold on.
It's not like I'm harming anybody.
And what's she supposed to do
with all that money her family sends her?
Buy a new pantsuit?
Her kids only send it so they can feel better
about sticking her here.
I keep her hopes up,
which does a lot more good
than some money she can't use.
Would you rather I tell her the truth?
"I'm sorry, Mrs Grace.
"You can call all you want,
but no one's coming to get you."
What's the point in that?
So I make a few bucks
and she can keep on believing.
It's better this way. Isn't it?
You aren't trying
to help anybody but yourself, Miguel.
I was wondering,
what's wrong with Modesto?
Modesto? It's what we call the long goodbye.
Modesto has Alzheimer's.
The engine's still running,
but no one's behind the wheel.
He doesn't even know where he is any more.
If it weren't for Dolores,
he'd be taken upstairs.
Dolores is a saint for looking after Modesto
the way she does.
In fact, she gave up her teaching career.
She doesn't need to be here.
She's still in perfect health.
She ought to have her head examined.
She's wasting her life away in here,
and, meanwhile, Modesto
can't tell whether it's her next to him
or a head of cabbage.
Stop it. Of course he can tell.
You don't know how it is, Miguel.
You've never been close
to anyone in your life.
She could be standing on his head
and he wouldn't know she's there.
He's knows she's there.
I'm sure he can sense it.
You see there? Emilio agrees with me.
You two are just a couple of
sentimental old fools, that's all.
Well, I think you're just bitter
because now that you're old, you're all alone.
Me? Do I look bitter to you?
And who says I'm alone?
I'm surrounded by so many vivacious people
that I have to worry
about being overstimulated.
The truth is, our dear families
love their freedom
<i>more than Granny and Stamps.</i>
So they lock us up in this hotel for old farts
and forget we ever lived.
How dare you?
I'll have you know that my family loves me,
something you wouldn't know
anything about.
I don't have to be in here.
I chose to be in here
so I wouldn't be a burden on them.
Young people have to live their own lives.
Antonia has three sons and four daughters
and something like 50 grandchildren.
But none of them ever bother
to stop by and visit her.
One of the grandsons will occasionally
come in every now and then.
My tea is already cold.
You have grandchildren?
What? Grandchildren?
Not at all.
I'm sorry. Before, I thought you said...
I've never been married
and I never had any children,
and I don't regret it one bit.
I've lived my life exactly how I wanted,
without answering to anyone
or getting tied to things
that I couldn't give up.
And you know what?
I still wound up here with the rest of you.
Only difference is that I'm not crying
because my children didn't come to see me.
I guess you have a point.
You spend your entire life working,
and for what?
Don't dwell on it.
With any luck, we'll both be dead
before long anyway.
My tea is already cold.
Okay, then.
I got a few things I need to do today.
You want to come with me, Rockefeller?
You'll meet some new people.
It'll be an adventure.
Good morning, Mrs Rosario.
Morning, are you also travelling to Istanbul?
Yes, in a manner of speaking.
We are the conductors.
Yes, of course. Please, come in.
I'm going to Istanbul
to meet up with my husband.
You're going to love it there.
Istanbul is a very beautiful city.
I just need to see your ticket, please.
Certainly, of course.
I know I have it here somewhere.
- Here it is.
- Very good.
Have a wonderful time,
and be sure to visit the Grand Bazaar.
They say it's quite the spectacle.
Enjoy your journey, Mrs Rosario.
Thank you, Conductor.
And a good day to you both.
She'll spend every day like this
just staring out the window.
She thinks she's on the Orient-Express.
I play along with her
because it keeps her happy.
It's better that way.
Come on, Rockefeller.
If they see us in here, we'll get in trouble.
Come on, Juan.
Dad! Dad, look what I just stepped on.
Juan, get closer to your mother. Closer.
No, no, your other left.
- Okay, hon, just take the picture.
- Yeah, take it!
Juan, lift up the starfish. Higher.
Where are you?
Marta!
Marta!
Hello?
Juan!
Marta!
Where are you?
Marta!
Juan!
Rise and shine, today is Wednesday.
Yeah? And what do we do today?
Extra napping?
No, Rockefeller.
On Wednesdays, we have gym.
- What?
- Gym.
But I didn't bring my tracksuit.
Yeah. Yeah, you told me.
And I told you you won't ever need it.
And the gym, it's a joke.
Today's not about what we get to do. No.
It's more about what we get to see.
What do you mean?
Sorry, I don't quite follow.
Trust me. You'll understand.
We may be old, but we're not dead yet.
Have you seen my wallet anywhere?
Your wallet? No, I haven't.
I left it on the table last night,
next to my watch. And now it's gone.
If that's where you left it,
it's gotta be there somewhere.
Maybe it fell
between the bed and the nightstand.
Did you look there?
Let me see.
- No, it's not there either.
- I don't know then.
Well, if it was there last night,
it'll turn up eventually.
But you should hurry up and get dressed
or you'll miss all the action.
I can help you look for it later.
I'm gonna go ahead and save us some seats.
See you in there.
Very good, everyone!
That's what I like to see.
All of us awake and full of energy,
ready for our workout.
Do you get it now, Rockefeller?
You know, why I wanted to get good seats?
Are we ready?
We have to touch our knees
with the opposite hand.
It's very simple. Everyone, just follow me.
- See how I'm doing it. Like this.
- What?
- I couldn't hear!
- Very good.
What did she say?
You need to speak louder.
What are we supposed to do?
We're using our hands and touching...
Come here, you beautiful thing!
Augustin may have lost his hearing,
but he sure hasn't lost his touch.
All right!
Let's just move on with the next exercise.
We're working on our coordination
by using this ball.
When it's your turn,
you take the ball from the person on your left
and pass it to the person on your right.
What? What did you say? I can't hear you.
You take the ball from your left
and pass it to the person on the right.
Come again. Still can't hear you.
You pass to the right.
To the person on your right!
- I said I still can't understand you!
-It's not that hard.
- Just take the ball...
- Could you just come a bit closer?
A little closer.
Patrick, you explain it to him.
Look, you pass the ball
to the person on your right.
Quit shouting at me!
Why don't you start, Antonia?
Move it around fast.
Let's try to beat last week's record, okay?
Get ready!
Here. It's here, Stephen. Take the ball.
What's wrong? Is he blind?
Yeah, happened about a year ago,
when his glucose went through the roof.
Stephen, take it...
Good catch, Miss Ana.
Here you go, Stephen.
- To the right. Pass to the right.
- Not me.
- Are you all right?
- I didn't mean to drop the ball, Miss Ana.
The ball, it's getting away.
- Here, I've got it. I've got it.
- Watch out!
No. No. I'm good. Don't worry.
Okay, here.
You take it then, Dolores.
Wake up! We're trying to beat our record!
Modesto, you're still awake. Here.
- Hurry, Augustin! You're...
- Pay more attention, Augustin.
- Now pass the ball.
- Butter fingers.
That's okay. I...
She's even more beautiful from behind.
Catch it, Patrick.
Very good. Good catch.
Great job, everyone!
We finished a whole two minutes faster
than last week's record. Nice work!
Fantastic! Very good. Very good.
Now, let's try the other way around.
So, we'll pass the llab to the left
after taking it from the right.
- That means you start, Emilio.
- What? The what?
The llab, Emilio, you just pass it to the left.
The what?
Pass the llab, Emilio. Just like before.
Hurry, Emilio.
Pass the llab, Emilio, or we will...
- Pass the llab, Rockefeller.
- Pass the llab.
The "ball". "Just pass the ball".
What on earth
could've possessed that poor woman
to go looking for a phone
in weather like this?
In here, Rockefeller, you got to give yourself
side projects in order to stay sharp.
If you don't keep yourself busy,
you run the risk of losing your mind,
like they did.
Some days, I've managed to get
as many as five of them out there.
See that woman with the umbrella?
That's Carmen.
She's never alone because she's terrified
that the alien will come and get her.
No!
Look at her go!
She's a lot faster than she looks.
Who knew paranoia could
keep you in such good shape, Rockefeller?
I don't think it's funny. I think that it's cruel.
That stuff doesn't matter in here, Rockefeller.
You got to do whatever it takes
to keep from getting sucked under.
I know it's not a fox terrier like you asked,
but you still like it, right?
Of course. Yes, she's just perfect.
Thank you, Miguel.
It was my pleasure.
And if you need anything else,
you just come find me, Martin.
- I can't get up.
- No problem. There you go.
Come here, little one.
We don't want you catching cold.
Thank you again, Miguel.
It was nothing. Don't mention it.
You have yourself a merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
I didn't think we were allowed
to have dogs in here.
You're right, Rockefeller. We aren't.
Martin keeps it in his room and
only takes it out for walks on weekends,
when he goes to see his son.
Okay. But what about
when that puppy gets bigger?
- Won't it be a problem?
-It won't be an issue.
Martin's very absent-minded.
He'll lose it before then.
I see.
Hey, with that beard,
you look like Santa Claus.
Rockefeller, you tell me the same thing
every day.
You're getting absent-minded too, you know.
Yeah. But it's true.
You're only missing the hat.
We should head inside. It's nearly lunchtime.
- Aren't you cold without a coat?
- No, I'm fine.
You know what?
You should grow a beard, too.
Then you could be one of my elves.
I didn't think elves had beards.
I didn't think Santa shared his bedroom
with another man.
But times, they're a-changing, Rockefeller.
Hey, Rockefeller,
you're gonna catch pneumonia
if you sleep with your pyjamas open like that.
What? No.
No, it's okay, really. I feel fine.
I hardly ever catch a cold.
Yeah? You, too? Us two are just a couple of
tough old coots, eh, Rockefeller?
You know, that's probably
because I've always been athletic,
ever since I was a kid.
I mean, I'm a natural at sports.
Especially when it comes to swimming.
My parents had a place on the ocean,
and when they died, I got the house.
Really?
I should be calling you Jacques Cousteau.
I ought to take advantage
of the swimming pool while I'm here.
I think maybe I'll go ask them
for the key tomorrow.
You go for it, Rockefeller.
A swim will do you some good.
Although tomorrow might be a little crazy,
what with the Christmas visits and all.
Hey, is your son coming to see you?
I have no clue.
Frankly, I don't care one way or the other.
Don't worry.
If you ask me, relatives are a bit like eggnog.
Never around till Christmas,
and suddenly it's everywhere.
Yeah. And too much of either
will give you heartburn.
That's true. And they're much better
with a little shot of rum.
Goodnight, Rockefeller.
Goodnight.
My watch was right here when I went to sleep
and no one else has come in the room!
- What are you saying?
- What do you think?
It didn't just suddenly sprout legs
and run away on its own.
Rockefeller, I haven't touched your watch.
You need to do a better job
of keeping track of your things.
Don't stand there and play innocent.
There isn't anyone else here,
so it must've been you!
All right, Emilio, calm down!
I'll help you look for it,
but don't you start with me.
"Help me look"!
How stupid do you think I am?
I'm onto you.
You know damn well where it is!
You may be able to steal from the others,
but not from me!
Hey, you better watch out
who you're pointing your finger at!
You're always losing things,
and now you've lost your mind!
Don't blame me for it.
That's not true, you liar!
You stole my watch and I want it back!
Get your hands off me, you crazy fool!
After all I've done for you,
how dare you accuse me?
Are you okay, Rockefeller?
I didn't mean to hurt you.
Give me back my watch, you thief!
You know what? I've had enough of this.
I'm through helping you.
Go find your stupid watch on your own,
you ungrateful jerk!
You're not going to get away with this!
I'm going to report you!
Fine! Go ahead, report me!
Who's gonna believe you?
I was looking for my watch.
Listen to me, Rockefeller.
If you put a finger on my things again,
or so much as breathe a word to anyone
about this box,
I swear I'm going to
beat the living shit out of you.
Is that clear?
<i>Are we clear, Rockefeller?</i>
Hey, Emilio, you all right?
Emilio, are you all right?
Is something wrong?
We missed you at breakfast today.
No. Everything's fine. I was just tired.
I decided to skip breakfast
so I could sleep in.
Well, maybe you're coming down
with something. Do you feel dizzy or...
No, I'm fine, really.
I just wanted to sleep a bit longer.
Okay, no problemo.
- Here, I brought your medication.
- Thank you.
Emilio, you're still not dressed yet?
Hurry up and get dressed,
your family is waiting for you in the lobby.
What?
Your family, Emilio, they've come to see you.
Here, Grandpa! Look at me! Over here!
Grandpa, why are you dressed like that?
Tyler, I told you
you have to turn the flash off.
Goodness! That was bright.
- Sweetie, don't bother your grandpa.
- I'm not bothering him!
See, look at the picture.
You're wearing your sweater
on top of your jacket.
Well, I feel more comfortable this way.
It can get a little chilly in here.
Sure. What do you think of my new camera?
It's 10 megapixels.
You can show it to him later, okay?
We're talking right now.
- Go over there and take some pictures.
- Fine.
- I'll show it to you later, okay, Grandpa?
- Sounds good to me.
Can you tell me, why does this boy
keep calling me "Grandpa"?
Dad, he's my son, Tyler, your grandson.
Don't you remember him?
Of course. Yes. Yeah, I do.
I was only joking. How could I forget him?
- I told you to turn that flash off!
- I don't know how!
Give it to me. I'll take a look at it for you.
- Sorry, Dad. Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine. I'm fine.
I'm just a bit more sensitive to bright lights,
that's all.
There's nothing to worry about, believe me.
I'm fine.
Dad, are they treating you well?
Are you happy?
Well, it's not bad.
I've made some good friends here.
And the nurses, they're all very nice.
Well, the food here is pretty good.
It's like going out to a restaurant every day.
And we have a gym class here once a week,
every Wednesday.
Gym every week?
You're gonna be in better shape than I am!
I just might. They even have
a swimming pool here, you know.
Yeah, I know. It was one of the reasons
why we chose this place, Dad.
We know how much
you've always loved swimming.
Yeah, but right now it's a bit cold, you know,
so I haven't been in the water.
But once spring rolls around...
Reporters from all over the world
wrote about how I set that amazing record.
"The Great Patrick", that was my name.
Merry Christmas, Grandpa!
Merry Christmas, Grandpa!
Merry Christmas, Grandpa!
They won't move me to a new room
and I can't sleep with Felix's snoring.
He's like a human chainsaw.
Before you leave,
look what Grandma got you.
They're just a few little things
I thought you might like.
Some nice tea and crackers,
a very delicious jam and some butter.
Also some soap from the casino.
That's okay, Grandma.
Why don't you keep it?
Hurry and put them in your pocket
before someone catches us.
Hey, everyone. I come bearing gifts!
I like how you look. So handsome.
I like your hat.
This'll be a bit tricky
with all of you out of your normal seats,
but we can figure it out.
- Here, Dolores, these are for Modesto.
- Thanks.
You got 'em?
Emilio, you've got long arms, here you go.
I knew being tall
would come in handy someday.
Hold on, Emilio. Hold on.
You, too, Dolores. I think I got 'em mixed up.
I need to take Modesto's pills back.
I accidentally gave Emilio's pills to Modesto
and Modesto's pills to Emilio.
Although it doesn't really matter much
since you two
practically have the same medication.
But just to be on the safe side.
Here.
What Marco said was correct.
The medication you're taking
is pretty much the same as Modesto's.
But I don't understand.
There must be some mistake
because Modesto has Alzheimer's.
Well, Emilio, Alzheimer's does not have
a specific treatment.
These medications have many uses,
and we frequently prescribe the same drug
for a range of conditions.
Of course! Of course! How silly of me!
I should've known it was something like that.
And here I was worried sick
that I had Alzheimer's.
That's understandable. It's natural.
You should try not to worry
about these things, Emilio.
<i>- I'll</i> do the worrying for you. That is my job.
- Yeah, right.
Sometimes my mind runs wild
and, well, you know how it is.
I feel much better now.
It's such a relief to know
that there's nothing wrong with me.
Who is that young woman upstairs?
You know who I'm talking about.
The paraplegic.
I told you not to go there.
Who's the young woman?
And what's she doing living here?
We call her Twiggy.
Get out of my face, you motherfucking...
<i>She used to be homeless.</i>
<i>And the building she was squatting in
collapsed while she was inside of it.</i>
<i>Left her a paraplegic.</i>
<i>She got no family,
so they decided to bring her here.</i>
They strapped her to a bed up there.
Like a chained animal.
They've all been left up there.
Abandoned and forgotten
like junk in the attic.
Why don't you see him? He's right there.
There's nowhere to hide.
...It has to change. Yes, yes, it has to change.
I know. That's why I said not to go up there.
Miguel,
I have Alzheimer's.
So they told you, then?
They didn't have the guts to tell me.
But I'm not an idiot.
You already knew?
You don't live here for as long as I have,
Rockefeller,
without picking up on a thing or two.
Unfortunately, I've been through this already
with my last roommate.
It was the exact same story.
He was a good guy, Murray.
- Did he die?
- No. No, not that I know of.
They stuck him upstairs like the rest of them.
So I imagine that he's still up there.
I don't want to end up like that.
Look, Emilio,
it's better to just not dwell on it.
You're doing okay right now.
It could be years before it starts to get worse.
However, if things do begin to get bad...
Well, you know those pills that you found
hidden in that cigar box
in the back of my closet,
it's my emergency stash.
I've been saving them in the event I...
Well, you know...
So, anyway, you know where they are
if you need them.
No. I wouldn't feel right about that.
You're always so worried
about what's right and wrong.
But your moral high road
won't get you anywhere around here.
There are only two options for you.
You can keep on lying to yourself,
and thinking everything's all right,
that you're on the Orient-Express,
that in spring
you'll start swimming in the pool,
until one day
they take you upstairs just like the others!
Or you can be a man and face reality.
No. What in God's name is he gonna do?
Hey!
Rockefeller, don't do anything stupid,
you hear me?
Look, I'm sorry about what I said, okay?
Now get out of there.
Come on! Stop it. You shouldn't be there!
Rockefeller.
Rockefeller!
Rockefeller!
Open! Piece of crap!
Rockefeller, what are you doing?
Come on, let's get out of here
before someone sees you like this.
Let's go. I'll help you up.
Get your hands off me.
I don't need your help. I'm perfectly fine.
I'm not dead yet, you know,
in case you haven't noticed.
Besides, aren't you the one
who's always telling me
that I should loosen up and live a little?
Plus, this is a swimming pool and
I'll be damned if you won't let me swim in it.
And if you don't like it,
well, then you can just go to hell.
You mean that's all you wanted to do?
Go swimming?
Of course that's all I wanted to do.
What else would I be doing in a pool?
But, Rockefeller, you can't swim like that.
You're supposed to take off your clothes
before getting into the pool.
Well, you're hardly one to talk, Miguel.
Look at you.
You're still wearing your winter coat.
Rockefeller.
You and me, we'll be okay.
Don't worry, I've got it all figured out.
We won't be going upstairs. You'll see.
Here, let me.
It's important that you get dressed properly,
Rockefeller, especially today.
The doctors and the nurses
can tell right away
if something's wrong just by looking at you.
Like if something's not quite right
about the way you're dressed, understand?
Sure. Like that woman.
Like that woman
who's always plastered in make-up.
Right, exactly. Just like Mrs Jefferson.
So, when she comes to breakfast
looking like an escaped circus clown,
the doctors have a pretty good idea
that she's not playing with a full deck.
You're all good.
Go ahead and tuck your shirt in.
Which tie do you want,
the red one or the usual?
The usual's fine.
But this one's boring.
I think you should wear the red one.
It's got a lot more class.
No, I'll stick to the black one.
You can have the red one if you like,
I never wear it.
I don't know why I hang on to it.
I guess it has sentimental value.
I can never get these things even.
There.
Okay. That'll do.
Thank you, Miguel.
Don't mention it.
We can't forget the cuffs.
No, remember the plan?
We leave the left cuff undone so you can
check the answers if you need them.
If you're not sure of something,
just look at your wrist.
Yeah, right. Of course.
They always ask the same questions,
so it should be easy.
Piece of cake.
Just remember to keep your palm face down,
though, so they don't see anything.
- You aren't getting nervous, are you?
- Who, me? No.
Although this'll be the first time
I've ever cheated on a test.
Well, then you're lucky to have me,
Rockefeller. I'm something of an expert.
Here, let's put your sweater on.
And if you get nervous, just remember
I'm gonna be close by, so don't worry.
But you still haven't said
how you're gonna get permission
to be in the doctor's office with me.
You haven't heard?
This morning, the doctor's office
is out of order due to technical difficulties.
Nope. We're gonna have to call a locksmith.
Looks like someone stuck chewing gum
in the lock.
You've got to be kidding.
Okay, Emilio,
we're going to have your exam out here
since they're still working on my office.
Although we can postpone it if you like,
if it's too noisy.
No, no. This is fine. I don't mind.
Thanks for understanding.
Now, just one moment
as I open up the program.
There we go. Now, Emilio,
tell me about your dinner last night.
My dinner?
You want me to tell you about dinner?
Yes, whatever you remember.
For example, what did you have?
Okay. Let me think.
The first...
The first course was...
It was...
It doesn't have to be the first course.
It can be anything.
My dinner. My dinner.
Ramon, please.
I'm busy with Emilio at the moment.
- Busy with Emilio. Busy with Emilio.
- Ramon.
- Busy with Emilio.
- Okay.
That's enough, Ramon.
- Please be quiet.
- Ramon, please be quiet.
Emilio.
Emilio, are you all right?
- Is there something wrong with your arm?
- No, no.
Don't distract Emilio any more, Ramon.
We're doing something important.
I'm terribly sorry, Emilio.
Let's start from the beginning again.
Now tell me,
what did you have for dinner last night?
Yes, last night, of course.
Let me see.
I don't normally pay
much attention to these things.
So I don't notice.
- Plus, it's always the same food, of course.
- Yeah?
True. You don't get much variety here.
A lot of people say the same thing.
Never mind that. Let's move on to the...
So, do you think it was one of the residents?
Or maybe one of the staff?
No clue.
- Okay, then. Well, I guess we're done here.
- All right, thanks, guys.
It said, "Break the glass."
Who knew that stupid alarm would
practically break my hand, too?
What do you think, Rockefeller?
Should I ask Nurse Ana to kiss it for me?
I screwed that up pretty bad, didn't I?
No, not at all. You were terrific, really.
Listen to me. Tomorrow, we'll keep
the doctor busy with some bad leg cramps,
a few headaches,
maybe even a temperamental bladder.
He'll be so busy, he'll forget all about
your exam and you'll be off the hook.
Trust me, you've got
nothing to worry about, Rockefeller.
I know what I'm doing.
Miguel.
Hey, Martin. Haven't seen you around lately.
How goes it?
And how's little Nina?
Still pissing on your carpet?
What? Did she run away already?
I was wondering
if you could get me another dog.
Sure, yeah, of course. Don't worry about it.
I'll get you another one. No problem.
Maybe this time, a fox terrier.
<i>"Our muscles ache and eyes will crinkle.</i>
<i>"Our hands have spots
and face have wrinkles.</i>
<i>"Our joints are sore, our backs won't bend,</i>
<i>"and sometimes we fear this is the end.</i>
<i>"Despite the love to you we've shown,</i>
<i>"you've left us here, all on our own.</i>
"And though we seem incompetent..."
And that's as far as I've got.
I can't think of anything
that rhymes with "incompetent".
How about
"And though we seem incompetent,
"we're actually incontinent."
Oh, Miguel! Speak for yourself!
Or better yet,
"Just don't think us incompetent.
-"We have pills to cure our impotence."
- This knife is useless.
Waitress! Waitress! Waitress!
- Hey, what's wrong? Emilio!
- This knife won't cut anything!
- Yes, Emilio, what is it?
- This stupid thing, it won't...
Actually, me and Emilio were
just talking about
how we'd love to have nothing
but sandwiches from now on.
- Sandwiches?
- Yeah, sandwiches.
Just some bread and meat.
We're simple guys.
Okay. I don't see why
that would be a problem.
Do you want sandwiches as well, Emilio?
But I...
Well, yes, yes. I want sandwiches as well.
All right, then. Sandwiches it is.
I'll let them know.
But don't come complaining to me
when you're sick of them.
Thanks, gorgeous!
You look more beautiful each day!
Hey, Emilio, maybe you should try
giving that other knife a shot.
The one next to the plate.
That one looks a little sharper.
What is all this stuff? Look at it.
And why is there so much of it?
Are they doing this to confuse us?
I think you may be onto something there.
But it's not an issue any more since
we'll be getting
some nice simple sandwiches from now on.
Guess we showed them, huh?
Oh, delightful.
If it wasn't for my dentures,
I'd have requested them, too.
I have my moments.
Here. It's dripping a bit.
There, all better now.
You're a cheater.
What do you say to him
that makes him smile?
You mean, to Modesto?
Yes, what is it you're always saying to him?
It's just an inside joke. I call him a cheater.
A cheater? Why call him a cheater?
It has to do with something from
back when we were children.
Feels like a lifetime ago.
We must have been maybe 12 or 13 years old.
Wanna be my girlfriend, Doli?
What?
You heard me. You want to be my girlfriend?
Modesto likes Doli! Modesto likes Doli!
- Modesto likes Doli!
- Stop that! Cut it out!
Okay, fine. I'll go out with you, Modesto,
but only if you can bring me a cloud first.
Why are you just standing there?
You better go catch a cloud for Doli!
Hey, watch it!
- No need to be in such a rush!
- Sorry!
Doli!
You have to come with me! We have to hurry!
Where are you going?
We're not allowed up there!
Wait! We can't go up there! Are you crazy?
- What if we fall?
- Don't be afraid.
We'll be fine. I've done this tons of times!
Trust me. Come on, give me your hand.
Don't worry, it's all right.
Just don't look down.
Hold on tight, okay, Doli?
Look, there it is.
All right, Doli.
You wanted a cloud and I got you one.
So,l guess
that makes you my girlfriend, right?
You're a cheater.
I guess you hadn't heard yet.
Modesto was getting worse, and Dolores,
poor thing, she couldn't cope without him.
They took them both upstairs this morning.
Dolores went up there, too?
But why would she do that?
There was nothing wrong with her.
In a couple of weeks,
she'll be as lost as the rest of them!
It's like suicide!
You wouldn't understand
because you've never loved anyone, Miguel.
And look where love got her.
You live your whole life,
and this is how it ends.
What are you doing, Rockefeller?
Come on, Rockefeller, where are you going?
I'm going home!
I'm fed up with you stealing my things!
Wait! What do you mean?
What do you think I stole this time?
Go ahead and play dumb. You always do.
You stole my black socks.
Who the hell steals socks?
Let go of me! Let go of me!
I'm going back home to my wife!
I've had it with this place!
Quiet down, Emilio,
or they're going to hear you.
I don't care who hears me! I'm leaving!
Shit! It's a nurse!
Shut up, Emilio. If they see you like this,
they'll send you upstairs!
Good morning. How are you?
Nice day, isn't it?
We're just headed out for a walk,
a little morning exercise!
Come on, Rockefeller, wave to the guy.
Let me go.
Look, Miguel,
maybe you didn't steal my socks,
but I'm still sick of living here,
and I'm getting the hell out and going home!
I can't take it any more,
and to be honest, I don't understand
why you stick around this place either.
The two of us should be back home
living with our families. What do you say?
Okay. It's all clear. Come on.
Slow down!
- I feel like I'm about to throw my back out.
- Be quiet!
Do you think
it's easy taking this walker off-road?
- Antonia, please keep your voice down.
- Okay, okay. Just don't go so fast.
What are you doing with that thing, anyway?
I thought I told you to leave it at home.
Don't be stupid!
You think I'm gonna listen to you?
I could fall and break my hip out here!
This is my own fault.
I shouldn't have told you we were going.
I would've found out anyway.
I'm not staying cooped up inside
while you two are out having a good time.
Okay, fine.
But we need to hurry, and be careful.
And keep your voices down, the both of you.
Gordo! You nearly gave me a heart attack!
Keep it quiet. Now hurry, this way.
What are you waiting for?
We haven't got all night!
That's much better.
We're not exactly spring chickens here,
you know?
Watch your head, Emilio!
You'll hurt yourself!
It's a bit late for that.
Be careful, Antonia,
don't get caught up on that wire.
Shine the light on the path, Gordo!
Can you see where you're going?
- Thank you, handsome.
- You're welcome.
Watch out, there's poison ivy.
Damn it, Gordo. I told you I wanted a red one!
Come on, Miguel, you gave me no notice.
You're lucky I found you a convertible at all.
Look, it's brand new and it's built for speed.
So, do you have the registration
and a full tank of gas?
Yeah, you're all set.
Well, all right. I guess we can live with it,
though I really would've preferred a red one.
Okay. Here's the money you wanted.
I'm a little short,
but don't ask for the rest 'cause I ain't got it.
I'm broke.
All right, all right. It's fine.
Here's the keys,
the papers are in the glove compartment.
- You're driving, Emilio.
- I'm driving?
No, I can't!
They revoked my license years ago!
Yeah, but at least you had a license.
Antonia, I don't suppose
you know how to drive, do you?
Who, me? Heavens, no.
I've never driven a car in my life!
Yeah, me neither. Believe it or not,
I just never got around to it.
So that leaves you, Rockefeller.
You'll be fine.
Just pretend you're Mario Andretti.
Oh, my God, Emilio!
That's it! Put the pedal to the metal!
- Freedom!
- What?
We're free! Free!
Have you lost your mind, Miguel?
Now what am I supposed to do?
Relax, you don't need it any more!
We've got our own set of wheels now!
And what do you suggest I use
once we get out of the car, genius?
- You think of that?
- Don't worry about it, all right?
I'll carry you around on my back if I have to.
And would you mind putting the top up?
I'm freezing my keister off back here.
Put the top up? You can't be serious.
You bet I'm serious!
Do you want me to end up with pneumonia?
- Actually, I'm getting a little bit cold myself.
- See?
I don't believe it.
What am I gonna do with you two?
It goes up on its own?
That's right. Cutting-edge technology.
Like it?
This is like a James Bond movie.
That's much better.
Now could you stop by a store?
I need some water so I can take my pills.
What are you talking about?
I thought we made a deal. No more meds.
We're not gonna be
slaves to old age any more.
Yes, yes. But I have to take my pills
for blood pressure and constipation.
You know how cranky I get
when I'm not regular.
Watch where you're going! What a maniac!
Rockefeller, I thought you said
you'd done this before.
Are you sure this is the right side?
You know what, I'm not sure.
Let me go take a look.
...you and your reckless behaviour.
You're fortunate you didn't hurt anyone else.
Or even worse,
you could've killed somebody!
And we're lucky that no one in the press
seems to have picked up on the story yet.
Because for something like this,
they could close the whole residence down.
Miguel, I don't think you fully understand
the seriousness of the situation
and the legal ramifications
of what you've done.
Are you listening to me, Miguel?
How's Emilio doing? Is he okay?
Emilio is exactly where he needs to be,
receiving the appropriate care and attention
for his condition.
Is Emilio getting better, though?
He suffered from multiple injuries
and was unconscious for quite a long time.
And then, with the anaesthetic
and the time he spent in the hospital...
This type of trauma can have a greater effect
on someone in his condition.
From now on,
Emilio will require around-the-clock care.
So I suggest you stop interfering with others
and start cleaning up your act.
I'm serious, Miguel.
One more complaint and I'll be forced
to transfer you to another home.
What's wrong? You're not eating.
Do you want them to bring you
something else?
Yes, it's open. Come in.
Thank you. May I join you?
Why, yes, yes. Be my guest.
Are you headed to the Orient?
Actually, I'm on my way to Istanbul.
Wonderful.
Then we can keep each other company
until the end of our journey.
Perfect! I'm not a big fan of travelling solo.
Oops! We missed a spot!
There. It's all cleaned up now. Much better.
You must've been pretty hungry today, huh?
Next time,
maybe I should let you lick the plate.
Okay, then. I guess
we'll just start cleaning up.
Miguel, you fucking dick-less loser,
will you turn this goddamn fucking straw
around already?
You'd better watch your language, Twiggy.
Or one of these days
I'm gonna stop doing you favours.
And if you can't behave,
I won't let you eat with us.
We prefer more refined conversation.
Emilio doesn't give two shits
about what I say.
There's nobody in there any more.
But that's where you're wrong, my friend.
He may have trouble showing it these days,
but he is definitely in there.
Ain't that right, Rockefeller?
Milo, it's no use barking like that.
You know I can't bring you in.
Sit. Sit, Milo. Sit!
Very good, Milo.
Milo! Milo!
Oh, please, God! No, no, no!
Milo!
Milo!
You really scared me, Milo.
Don't be so absent-minded next time.
