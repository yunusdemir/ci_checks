Stop, Squirrel.
Put them on.
Look!
''Cranes like ships, sailing in the sky
White ones, grey ones
With long beaks they fly''
Look, look!
There you go.
You and your ''cranes like ships.''

Who's there?
Wait.
Well, okay.
When?
- Thursday, at the embankment.
- Come on, that's too long!
Squirrel!
We haven't finished.
Squirrel!
When?
What time on Thursday?
No, I can't.
I'll be at the factory.
Okay.
Don't be late!
Squirrel!
She's crazy about him.
And he about her.
That's what love is, my dear:
a harmless mental illness.
Why aren't you in bed yet,
Grandma?
It's already time to get up, Boris!
Quit making noise!
Running around all night...
You're just jealous.
Did you tear it?
Your jacket's all in one piece.
Disgraceful!
Twelve o'clock,
and he's still asleep.
He works a lot.
He's tired.
Let him at least get some sleep
on Sunday.
This ''work'' of his
will end in a wedding.
You're just afraid of losing him.
Irina's mind should be on her thesis,
not on a wedding.
Watch out, Uncle Fedya.
She almost has her doctorate
and you're still just a physician.
Well, if children don't surpass
their parents,
then the parents are bad
and the children not much better.
Thanks, Mama.
Important announcement!
What's going on?
Boris! War!
You hear me? War!
Leave me alone.
Hello.
Boris is at the factory
day and night.
Are you waiting for him?
I'm not waiting for anyone.
Veronica.
In wartime, it's important
not to lose your head.
Try to live a normal life.
Like me...
I dream of dedicating
a piano concerto to you.
Will you come to hear it?
- Won't you be drafted?
Drafted?
I don't know. I doubt it.
And why is that?
The most talented people
will be exempt.
- And you suppose you're talented?
- Yes.
Why are you always
following me around?
You ought to be ashamed.
I am.
I promised myself a thousand times
I wouldn't.
I know Boris is my cousin,
but I can't help myself!.
You understand? I can't.
Wait!
There's no need to escort me.
Watch out!
You'll hurt your leg.
It'll be harder at the front,
my dear Boris.
They won't let you go to the front.
There will be only one exemption.
Either for you or for me.
That's right. So you should stay.
You've got knowledge and experience.
And you've got something
more important-- talent.
Take care of your drawings.
You know,
my wife's already got my bags packed.
Well, as they say,
let's get our bayonets ready!
Stepan!
Excuse me, Sachkov.
Well? Where's the notice?
Nothing yet. I don't understand
why they're so slow.
Are you going home?
- No, I'm...
- Oh, I see. Well, say hello to her!
- I will.
What?
- Have you told her?
- No. Why should I rush it?
- You're right. See you tomorrow.
- Take care!
- Let go.
- I won't let go.
You're gonna fall!
Let go. You'll tear the shade.
- It's a blanket.
- Let go. I'll call the police.
- I'm tired of these blackouts! Give it to me!
- You're gonna fall.
- I am not.
Squirrel, stop it.
Let me hang this up.
You didn't come to the embankment
today, but Mark did.
- So?
- He's handsome.
So?
- Are you jealous?
- What?
- Are you jealous?
- I don't have the time.
Too bad.
I think I'll enroll
at the Architectural Institute.
- They won't accept you.
- Yes, they will.
I doubt it.
Cranes like ships
sailing in the sky
White ones, grey ones
with long beaks they fly
Do you like my song?
Very profound.
Little croaking frogs
Why didn't you look up?
You kept on hopping and jumping
That's why you got eaten up
Eaten!
Well, hero, did you win?
I won, I won.
I won.
Do you think you'll be drafted?
- Of course.
- Would you volunteer?
- I might.
No, you won't!
You know very well you'll be exempt.
That's why you talk so big.
- What makes you so sure?
- I know.
All the smart ones
will be exempt.
So only fools will fight?
I don't want to discuss it
any further.
Veronica...
I want to talk to you
about something.
Well, I don't.
And please don't call me Veronica.
Who am I?
- Squirrel.
- That's right.
Listen.
What will you give me tomorrow?
It's a secret.
If it's something good to eat,
I'll eat it and forget about it.
Give me something
I will always remember,
for as long as I live.
Kiss me.
You know, when you're with me,
I'm not afraid of anything,
not even the war.
I'm afraid of the police.
Veronica.
You know what?
Do you know?
For the wedding
I'm going to make
a white dress.
Like the one my grandma had.
And a long, long veil.
And you'll wear a black suit,
and we'll go...
- To the registry office.
- Agreed then?
- Agreed.
You know, I like this blackout.
What's so good about it?
Hey!
Stepan!
I have a treat for you.
- What is it?
- It's a secret.
- Did it arrive?
- It did.
Why didn't you say so?
Tell me.
Things are crazy at the factory!
The guys ran to the barber's.
I went straight to your place.
- Make it short.
-Just wait.
So I was saying, the guys ran--
Listen, can't you make it shorter?
- Your family's worried.
- What time do we report?
Today at 5:00. With your things.
Look at these cherries.
- What is it?
- Beautiful.
The notice came.
Really? For you?
Yes, for me too.
We both volunteered.
What?
You volunteered?
But the notice came...
Wait. What about me?
I'd better go home.
I've got a lot going on there too.
Squirrel.
I didn't want to tell you.
Tomorrow's your birthday.
I have to go.
Of course.
Squirrel.
What's the matter?
Cranes like ships
You like my poem?
Nothing will happen to me.
You hear?
And then you and I will live
for a long, long time.
A hundred years.
Go.
We'll say good-bye later.
All right.
Don't be late.
Can't he stay home until tomorrow?
He's a swine
if he's still at Veronica's.
Boris!
- Did Dad call?
- Yes. He's furious.
Why didn't you tell us?
To avoid scenes like this.
Go to the factory tomorrow
and turn these over
to Kuzmin, the engineer.
I will, I will.
What are you stuffing in there?
I'm running out
for a bottle of wine.
Grandma, do me a favor.
Just a minute.
Will they send you to the front
right away?
Probably.
Here... wait a minute.
Early tomorrow morning
take this to her.
What is it?
It's her birthday tomorrow.
And later, if things
are hard for her--
After all, this is war...
Help her out.
And if I die?
You've got no business dying,
especially now that you know
so many secrets.
I just might up and die.
Quiet. That's Veronica.
No, it's Irina.
Thank God, you're home.
Boris!
Come over here.
What is this about?
You're 25 years old and you--
forgive me-- act like a fool!
What are we? Children?
Is this a game?
Hide-and-seek?
He wants adventure!
There's character for you.
Where are Irina and Mark?
Irina's making coffee.
Mark went out to buy some wine.
Coffee, wine!
What's wrong with people
these days?
Irina!
Bring me the bottle
from the medicine cabinet.
Boris! Come here.
Where's Veronica?
- She'll be here any minute.
- Where is she?
She's busy.
This isn't right.
She should be here.
Her fiance is leaving.
I'm not her fiance.
- What are you, then?
- We're just...
You're just what?
That sounds suspicious.
- I don't mean it that way, Dad.
- Then what do you mean?
- Stop picking on me.
- Wait!
- Why are you bothering him?
- Here. From the medicine cabinet.
- Go ahead and mix it properly.
- Here's the port.
Drink it yourself.
We'll have a real drink.
So, is everybody here?
Sit down.
It's Veronica!
Go meet your bride,
Mr. Bridegroom!
Finally!
- We came from the factory to see Boris.
- Please come in.
And I thought the bride had arrived.
- We're from the plant.
- They told us to bring you these gifts.
Sorry. This one.
- On behalf of the Plant Committee--
- And the Communist Youth League--
What you want to say is:
''Comrade Boris, fight to the last
drop of blood, and beat the fascists!
And we at the plant will meet
and exceed our production quotas.''
We've heard all that before.
Why don't you sit down with us, girls,
and drink to my son Boris!
Things in this world
aren't going as smoothly
as we might like.
So now you're off to war, Boris...
- Let's have a drink!
- To you!
A glass for Grandma.
We sent our brother off yesterday.
Mother cried and cried.
What about you?
- I cried too.
- On behalf of the Plant Committee?
- No, on my own.
- Don't embarrass her.
We've got no one to send off.
There's just Mother and three girls.
We even felt a little ashamed,
with all the others leaving...
When our men come back,
you'll envy us.
The trouble is
not all of them will come back.
For those who don't, we'll build
a monument reaching to the sky
with every one of their names
in gold.
Irina, pour another round.
What are you waiting for?
I'll just put these away.
Well, you folks in the rear,
meet and exceed your quotas!
Grandma, don't forget.
Mark, don't go. Stay with Father.
- I'll walk you to the trolley.
About face!
Guards, forward march!
- Mother!
- The last time.
I'm sorry.
Not in the mood for a drink?
Where are you going?
- I'm going on duty.
You were on duty yesterday.
Varvara Kapitanova, may I see Boris
for just a moment?
- He already left.
- He left?
Where did he go?
- To the assembly station.
- Oh, no.
- Come in.
- Where's the assembly station?
- I don't know.
- What's this?
- It's from Boris, for your birthday.
There's a note too.
- Where's the note?
- Isn't it there?
He must have forgotten
in the rush.
Forgotten?
He'll write to you.
Where were you?
- Where's the assembly station?
- It's on Zvenigorodskaya.
Don't worry. She'll come.
Even if she does,
how will she find me in this crowd?
What are you doing?
Boris, where's Veronica?
Write to me every day.
Who has the invoices
for the cauliflower?
Don't forget to send
your field address.
Cheer up, pug-nose!
Take care!
Fall in!
She'll come.
Boris!
Fall in!
Forward march!
There's my kitten.
Grandma?
Nothing?
He hasn't written to me either.
- Anything?
- No.
Oh, this war.
Well, rain or shine,
we must carry on.
Have you decided where you'll work?
I'll go to the war factory.
Citizens! Air raid alert!
Hurry down to the subway.
I've got some urgent work to do.
Go get your things.
Where's the backpack?
- The backpack? It's right there.
I won't go without you.
If it becomes dangerous,
we'll go down to the shelter.
Go now.
Be careful in the subway.
She's so scared, poor girl!
- What about you?
When Veronica is safe
and you're by my side, I'm not afraid.
They're still at it, the brutes.
Those parasites
won't even let us talk!
For some reason
he doesn't write to me.
It's the war.
The mail is so slow.
All clear.
The air raid is over.
Let's go.
Well, my place is right here.
If you decide to come join us,
call me at the factory.
- Okay.
- Good-bye.
Where are you going?
Get back!
Where do you think you're going?
I'm sorry.
Veronica,
you'll stay with us
from now on.
Boris' room is free for now.
Mark will share a room with Fedya.
Mark, we must take
good care of her.
Unfortunately, Irina and I
are at the hospital day and night.
I'll try, Uncle Fedya.
Boris spoke to me about it.
Are you all right now?
Is this the factory?
May I speak to Kuzmin, please?
He's gone to the front too?
Excuse me. Is there any news
from Boris Borozdin?
If it weren't for the damned war,
I'd be playing this
at Tchaikovsky Hall.
For you.
- Veronica, let's go to the subway.
- I'm not going.
- That's nonsense! Let's go.
- Are you afraid?
Only for your sake.
Come on, let's go.
I'm not afraid of anything.
Veronica, let's go! Don't be foolish.
You're acting crazy!
I won't go!
I won't, I won't, I won't!
I love you.
No.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you!
- Go away!
I love you.
What a stupid way
to get surrounded.
- Stepan, stop whining.
- What do you mean, stop whining?
The captain said we might
break through by tonight.
- At last! Sachkov!
- Here!
Where's this rookie from?
Straight from an incubator.
A fresh reinforcement.
Now we'll break through for sure.
Is that any way
to speak to a married man?
- Is that right?
- I got married in school.
See what education does to people.
You funny guys, always joking!
Laughed yourselves right into a trap.
Volodka, are you really married?
Are you kidding?
Sounds better, though, doesn't it?
Borozdin!
You'll go out on reconnaissance.
Your job is to find the best place
to break through.
Turn over your papers.
- Yes, sir.
Hey, Sachkov!
Come on, help me here.
Let's take a break, guys,
and have a smoke.
She's always laughing like that.
- They must think we're dead.
Let me see that beauty.
Yep, the life of a soldier.
You're over here, and she's--
And she's what?
Give me the harmonica.
Sachkov, hold it for a second!
Stop it!
Aren't you ashamed?
- No.
Five days' arrest.
You'll both go on reconnaissance.
Turn in your papers.
Boris, here.
Because of her?
She's worth fighting for.
- Exactly.
Stop that chatter!
Discipline!
Hear that? Discipline.
Stepan, hold on to this.
Just don't lose it.
We're getting married, Uncle Fedya.
I forgot...
I still have some sausage.
- Keep your head down.
- Stop giving me orders.
- Let's get out of here or they'll get us.
- Run if you're scared.
You idiot!
Hey, you! Musician! You deaf?
How the hell
did I get stuck with him?
What's wrong? Hey, you!
Go on alone.
I want to rest for a bit.
- Are you wounded? Hold on to me.
- Leave me alone.
Hold on to me, I said,
and hold on tight!
Here, get on my back.
It'll be faster this way.
Leave me here.
- Idiot! You're sore because I punched you.
- You were just lucky I--
Shut up. We'll settle it later.
Hold on, hold on.
A little further to the woods,
and then we're safe.
I'm tired. Let's rest a bit.
It's quieter here.
So, are you alive?
- It's a little hard to breathe.
- To breathe?
We'll dance at your wedding yet.
Hey, buddy!
What's the matter?
Forgive me. Forgive me.
Forgive me, friend!
Hey, somebody, help!
Help!
Help!
Boris!
What's wrong, Boris?
Are you wounded?
I'm not wounded. I...
The Soviet Information Bureau
reports
no important changes
on the fronts
in the last 2 4 hours.
No important changes.
That's good.
Families evacuated
with Moscow Plant 3 26
will be quartered
on Vostaniya Street.
Comrades, report here.
Irina, help this wounded man.
- The paramedics will be here soon.
- Yes.
Unload!
Siberia. We can't retreat
much farther.
This is what's become
of Mother Russia.
Attention, attention!
Chief of Hospital Number 4,
Borozdin,
report to the military commandant.
Perhaps we'll find
some peace here.
Clear the way, folks.
The stove is smoking.
I'm sorry.
You can daydream
when the war is over.
Where are you going?
To the hospital.
I'm on duty.
She wanders around like a ghost,
all nerves.
She's always waiting for a letter.
From whom? Her husband's right here.
Not like us, soldiers' wives.
She's not waiting for a letter
from anyone.
- Are you on the second shift at school?
- Yes.
''Cranes like ships
sailing in the sky.''
Those silly lines
are stuck in my head.
There it is.
- What?
The mail.
If I can count up to 50,
there'll be a letter for me.
- Veronica, this is crazy.
- ...1 6, 1 7, 1 8, 1 9...
...20, 21 ...
- Stop!
... 45, 46, 47...
- Hello.
- Hello.
There's nothing for you.
For you.
Lededeva?
- That's me.
- Palyukaitis?
- Nothing.
From my eldest son
on the Ukrainian front.
I didn't know Boris,
but everyone says
he was a gifted young man.
Was?
Missing doesn't mean dead.
Of course not.
That didn't come out right.
What's the matter, Veronica?
I'm dying, Anna Mikhailovna.
My dear, what are you saying?
- I've lost everything.
- You have your life ahead of you.
I don't want to live!
What's the use?
- Forget the past.
It's human nature to forget.
I don't want to forget.
There's nothing I need to forget.
You mustn't punish yourself
forever.
I must. Till the end.
You teach history.
You're an intelligent woman.
Tell me:
What is the meaning of life?
The meaning of life?
Perhaps it's that...
Was Chernov here?
No.
Boy, am I hungry!
If Chernov comes, try to be polite.
He's revolting.
I may find him even more revolting
than you do,
but he's the boss.
Why do you always
kiss up to him?
Dear Veronica,
you're impossible.
You're always so irritable,
and you keep picking on me.
Tell me what I can do for you.
I wish you had never been born.
Come in!
- I hope I'm not intruding.
- We're always happy to see you.
Make yourself comfortable.
Did you hear? The Germans
have advanced in the Caucasus.
It's awful. But don't worry.
We'll show them yet.
Please, make yourself comfortable.
Your place is cozy.
My wife and children are in Tashkent,
so I live like a homeless tramp.
Hello, Veronica.
- Where are you going, dearest?
- I'm on duty at the hospital.
- Bundle up. It's very cold.
I admire your wife.
She's always so candid, so pure.
She must be very happy with you.
I looked for you today
at the Philharmonic.
- Was there a concert?
- No.
Will you be at the birthday party
tonight?
Probably.
- What will you take for a gift?
- What can I give?
Yes... the war.
It's nothing great,
but attach a little something to it
and I'm sure Antonina
will be very happy.
It's wonderful.
How much do I owe you?
- It's nothing. Don't mention it.
- Thanks very much.
Mark, I have a favor to ask.
Is there anyone upstairs?
No.
Do you think you could ask
Fyodor Ivanovich
for some medicine?
Good job, Irina.
He's going to live.
I hope so.
He'll be a real swine if he dies.
Irina, you should have
been born a man!
I feel pretty good as a woman.
Veronica, why are you so early?
The clock was fast.
Poor girl.
I'll never forgive
what she did to Boris.
Here comes another batch!
I've told you already, we're full!
This is a hospital,
not a sardine can!
Where are they all from? Kalach?
- Stalingrad.
Some from the front,
some from the hospital.
There's no room.
Don't worry, they'll make room.
I'll take 80 men.
The rest will have to go
to other hospitals.
Now, then...
give my regards to Uncle Sergei,
Fyodor, Vassily,
Aunt Marya, Agrafena,
Katerina, Varvara,
Nikolai,
Katerina.
You already said Katerina.
This is a different Katerina.
- Then you should say so.
- It's okay. They'll figure it out.
So... Zinaida,
Antonina, Kuzma...
Nurse!
What's the matter, Vorobyev?
Nothing. I want the nurse.
He needs the bedpan.
I'll get it for you.
Thank you.
That's lovely music.
Turn up the radio, please.
Turn off that music!
Turn that music off!.
You hear me?
Who yelled?
I did!
What's it to you?
- Zakharov, what's wrong?
- Go away!
He's losing his mind.
He got word from home this morning.
His girlfriend didn't wait for him.
She married someone else, the bitch.
He hasn't eaten all day.
Try to comfort him.
Broads like that are worse than fascists.
They aim right at the heart.
You have to eat, Zakharov,
or you won't get well.
I don't want to get well!
I want to die!
Call the doctor!
Calm down.
All because of some broad!
Call the doctor!
Quit yelling! Shut up!
Where will they take us now?
There are plenty of hospitals
in the world.
The head doctor's coming, boys!
Stop it this minute!
You're still a soldier in the Red Army!
Are you trying to get discharged?
Are you afraid we'll heal your hands
and send you back to the front?
No, Doctor, he's not like that.
He got a letter.
- I know. That's just an excuse.
Big deal! So your bride ran off.
You should be glad!
She isn't worth a penny if she would trade
a handsome guy like you, a real hero,
for some rat sitting out the war
at home!
It's she who's forfeited
her happiness, not you!
And that's what she deserves.
That's right.
She's got a petty soul.
People like her can't understand
how much suffering we've gone through.
Killing people like her
would be too kind!
You stood up to Death itself.
You looked death in the face.
You approached it with your chest stuck out.
And she couldn't even pass
the little test of time.
Women like her
deserve only our contempt.
There can be
no forgiveness for them!
Bandage him up.
Aunt Sima, bring him
some tea and porridge.
Don't be a brat.
Veronica...
You idiot!
Keep an eye on your kid!
And it would have been my fault!
Just standing there
with your mouth open like an idiot!
- Whose boy are you?
- Mama's.
- Where are you from?
- Voroshilovgrad.
- How old are you?
- Three months and three years.
What's your name?
Boris.
- What?
- Boris.
- Why the fancy get-up?
- A concert at the hospital.
- Can't you tell a better lie?
- All right, all right.
- Is Mark here?
- He is now.
- Here.
- Thank you, Anna.
A little boy is having a birthday
and I wanted to give him a present.
You are a kind man after all,
Mark Alexandrovich.
''The symptoms
of such compound fractures
depend on the degree of changes
in the joints,
as well as on the location.''
Interesting, but unintelligible.
Why, I think it's quite clear.
What's this?
What kind of trick is this?
What trick? He lost his parents
at the station.
You should have taken him
to the shelter for lost kids.
I don't want to go to the shelter!
Go there yourself!.
- Rude child!
- You're rude.
Quiet, quiet. We'll go find Mommy
in Voroshilovgrad.
Stop that noise!
It's hurting my ears.
Here, play with this cap!
Here's a bagel for you.
- My eardrums will burst!
- We need to find a toy for him.
Irina, take him for a minute.
So now I have to hold him too?
Here, give him to me.
Come to me, little one.
I'll get you ready for bed.
Has anyone seen my squirrel?
Mark took it.
Mark? Where'd he take it?
To give to some little boy
as a present.
Some little boy?
- Where's Mark?
- I don't know.
- Where's Mark?
- I don't know.
You're hiding something from me.
Where did he go?
You know, don't you?
Where?
Probably to see Antonina.
What Antonina?
Ask Mark.
- Tell me.
- Don't give me orders.
Mark... visits her occasionally.
You understand?
- You're saying this to hurt me.
- Why would I?
Just to spite me!
I'm loved.
I have a husband.
And you're still an old maid.
She lives in a small house
near that large market.
You can check it out for yourself.
It's okay, it's okay.
I have to do something,
I have to do something.
Talk to Mark when he comes back.
You should wait.
Wait?
Always waiting.
I'm always waiting.
I've had enough!
What use are words
Let lips fall silent
Sometimes
They tell lies
The eyes alone
Will never dare
To lie to other eyes
My eyes are now
Dark and sad
As though someone
Had blown out their flame
In Leningrad on my birthday,
we'd take a car and go
from one end of the city to the other.
Let's go for a ride!
In these times, Antonina,
a car is worth its weight in gold,
and gasoline is rationed.
Any kind of vehicle.
I beg you!
A fire engine, an ambulance,
a truck.
Anything you like.
A ride against the forces
of nature!
Just the two of us?
To forget everything else.
I'll try.
I love you.
Sorry. I don't dance.
I thought I had tried everything,
but I've never tried golden nuts.
Look, a message.
A birthday note for me?
So it's for your birthday?
Where's my squirrel?
Don't get the wrong idea.
There's a note from someone
named Boris.
''My only love,
happy birthday to you.''
On this day you came
into this world.
It's hard to leave you.
But what can we do?
This is war.
There's no way around it.
We can't continue living happily
as we did before
when death stalks our land.
But we'll be happy yet.
I love you.
I have faith in you.
Your Boris.
What are you so excited about?
Go home. I'll be there soon.
What's that for?
Take your coat off.
Thank you.
You know, as usual
all the Philharmonic's cars
are taken,
and I need one badly.
You're the head surgeon and all.
Surely you won't refuse...
We're very short on vehicles.
It was hard to do what I did for you,
but I did it.
When you asked me to,
I did my best.
What did I ask?
For an exemption.
It's about to expire,
and this time,
getting a new one will be
practically impossible.
- What exemption?
- For Mark Alexandrovich.
Don't worry.
Not a soul will know about this.
Is it possible
he lied to both of us?
He even offered me money
in your name.
I'm sorry.
Very good. Uncle Fyodor,
I turn to you for help.
Her behavior's impossible.
She stormed into a stranger's place,
started a fight...
Shut the door.
Do you think
anyone wants to send his son
to war?
What are you talking about?
Or do you think others must pay
for your welfare, for your life,
with their hands,
their legs, their eyes,
their lives,
and you owe nothing to anyone?
I have an exemption, Uncle Fedya.
An exemption?
Tell me, how did you get it?
Why are you doing this?
It's okay.
I'll rent a room,
I'll take Boris...
Perhaps someone else
had better rent himself a room.
Gladly! I've thought
about doing that for a long time.
Why didn't you throw me out
in the first place?
You've been through
a terrible ordeal.
Only someone without a heart
could reproach you.
Stay with us.
I can't.
I don't want to hide behind
someone else's back. I won't!
Think it over.
Could you tell me
where the Borozdins live?
They live here.
Which of them do you want to see?
- Fyodor Ivanovich.
He's not home.
Did Boris send you?
What Boris?
No, I came on my own.
I must speak to Fyodor Ivanovich.
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.
He'll be home soon.
- May I go for a walk?
- You may.
Is he yours?
He looks like you.
Are you a relation
of the Borozdins?
Not exactly.
You see, I'm out of the army.
Going home?
It's unlikely. There's still a blockade
around Leningrad.
I'm in a difficult situation.
- What is it?
- It's easy to tell you.
You're not part of the family.
Fyodor Ivanovich's son was killed.
Where?
West of Smolensk.
What shall I play for you?
Whatever you like.
Did you see him buried?
No.
I was injured and they carried me away
on a stretcher,
but a friend of his, Stepan,
went up to him.
Now I have to find his girlfriend.
He loved her very much.
That's me.
Vladimir, come to see us
if you're ever in Moscow.
Thank you. I'll do that.
The war's over.
Strange, isn't it?
And you're still waiting?
Yes, I am.
One must always hope for the best.
Why do you delude yourself?
I saw it with my own eyes.
What did you see?
How he was wounded?
How he fell?
But you didn't see him die
with your own eyes.
No... but why haven't you
heard from him?
A lot of things
could have happened.
There's no word from Stepan either.
At the factory they know he's in
some special unit and will be back soon.
Dasha promised to tell me
when he's back.
Boris is alive. He's alive.
- Look, here they come!
- The victors are coming!
Boris!
- Veronica!
- Stepan!
Flowers for you.
Well? What?
You see...
Here.
Dear mothers, fathers,
sisters and brothers!
The happiness of our reunion
is immeasurable.
The heart of every Soviet citizen
is filled with joy.
Joy sings in our hearts.
It is victory that has brought us
this joy.
We have all waited
for this moment.
Everyone's dizzy with happiness.
But we shall not forget those
left behind on the battlefield.
Time will pass.
Towns and villages will be rebuilt.
Our wounds will heal.
But our fierce hatred of war
will never diminish!
We share the grief of those
who cannot meet
their loved ones today,
and we will do everything
to insure
that sweethearts are never again
parted by war,
that mothers need never again fear
for their children's lives,
that fathers need never again
choke back hidden tears.
We have won,
and we shall live not to destroy,
but to build a new life!
Why are you just standing there?
Give your flowers
to whomever they're for.
Thank you, sister.
My beautiful granddaughter!
Look, look!
Cranes are flying over Moscow!
THE END
