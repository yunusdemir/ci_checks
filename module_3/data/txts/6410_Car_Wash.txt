'cause you ain't got the news
till you get it...

It's Friday... T.G.I.F. Day.
There's smog in the basin,
traffic on the freeway,
crime on the streets,
music all day long at KGYS.
It's 7.47, baby.
That's a good time to fly.
Can you dig it?
Hey, get right tonight.

station identification.
Hey, peace, Lonnie.
How you be, man?
All right.
Ohh, do it
Good morning,
this is Billy Bass,
and this is the news.
In Washington, a new scandal
as congressional investigators...
probed into the rumors...
of male congressional aides...
being hired
by male congressmen...
in exchange for sexual favors.
Mm-hmm.
This will never do,
honey.
Here in Los Angeles,
gay activist spokesman
Harry Twig...
issued a statement applauding
the alleged violation of...
the ethics committee rules...
after an extended filibuster
and a special caucus.
A Southern senior committee
member replied that he had...
no objection to homosexuals...
as long as they stayed
in their place.
Yee-hah!
Come on,
let's go!
You don't know
what you have to do in life.
You're very confused.
Shut up.
Don't tell me...
to shut up...
just shut up. Okay?
Don't tell me to shut up.
You shut up.
Say, Otis,
is, uh, Mona here?
She's late again,
as usual, T.C.
All right, all right,
all right.
Today we got the big three.
Yeah?
Yeah.
The baseball pool,
the fight...
and the jai alai.
Jai alai?
Yeah, they're playing...
jai alai in Tijuana.
I thought that was a dance.
A dance?
I'm gonna bet two dollars
on the fight.
On the fight?
All right.
Yes, sir.
Uptight, outta sight.
Stand and deliver,
honey.
Ow-oooh!
Oy, mamacita...
You sexy thang!
Watch it.
Here comes Ann-Margret.
Keep an eye on your zippers!
One thing you can
be sure of, Hippo:
When I'm around,
your body is safe.
Lindy, where's my money?

How'd you like our new opening?
Lonnie, what did you
think about it?
Well...
it's improving.
Say what?
No, no. No!
No! That's all right.
They're fools, man.
They don't know, man.
Hollywood!
Hey.! T. C...!
Don't he look good?
Whoo!
Well, kiss my grits!
Damn!
All right!
What's wrong, buddy?

Will you just put that stuff away.
August 15, 1945.
From the selected works
of Chairman Mao.
I heard you already,
damn it.
Morning, Mr. B.
Morning, Snapper.
Good morning, Mr. B.
How are ya?
Lonnie.
Irwin.
Come on, Irwin.

Hey, Irwin.
How you doin'?
Hey, Lonnie.
Hey, all right.

Hey, baby.
What's happenin'?
Oh, man...
Don't think I know that one.
Lay back, baby.
I'll catch you later.
You want it, they got it,
on easy terms.
Hey, T.C. I ain't heard
nothin'about the Fly...
in a long time, man.
That's the way it is
with the Fly, brother.
He just lays back, man.
He checks the buzz...
Hear the cry... Whoo!
Is it a bird? Is it a plane?
No, dude, it's the Fly!
All right, man!
All right.
Check this out.
You ain't seen nothin' yet.
Whoa!
"Get down tonight."
Hey! Hey!
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, look at that here.
"Get down tonight."
Put your heart in my hand, honey.
Look out,
Mr. Clean!
Now hear this!
I believe it is exactly
2 minutes, 11 seconds...
to opening.
Thank you.
Keep the change.
You probably noticed
I ain't got nothin'
against you people.
I ain't got nothin'
against any people.
That's what I think we need
is more love in the world.
I don't know about marriage.
I don't know...
if I'd go that far.
But I believe in
the lunch counter thing.
If a guy wants something
to eat, he oughta be able...
to get something to eat.
Come on!
Let's move it up there!
What is this, a Mobil Gas
economy run? Come on!
Bunch o'bastards.!
Move it!
Yeah, you're probably wonderin'
why I even picked you up...
in the first place.
A lot of guys are scared
of gettin' ripped off,
beat out of their fares.
A KGYS public health service
announcement.
Hi, Leon!
Remember.
Cancer cures smoking.
Watch it, Marsha.
My son's here today.
Oh. Okay.
I used to drive
a gypsy cab in New York.
Know what a gypsy cab is?
Gypsy cab'll go to Harlem,
to a Puerto Rican...
neighborhood.
We used to have
a slogan on the side...
of the gypsy cabs.
Kinda funny,
now that I'm workin'
with the Yellow Cab.
Slogan used to be,
"We will go anywhere.
We are not Yellow."
"We are not Yellow."
It's no kind of a slur
on the Chinese...
or anything like that.
But I ain't afraid
because I trust people.
I trust people because I like 'em.
Come on, you bastard!
Come on!
I could tell from a block
away that you was honest.
I could tell by your eyes.
Well, not the eyes, actually,
from a block away.
But I go by body language.
You got a real honest body.
You bastard.
The Philadelphia Flyer's
record run...
in the women's 100-yard dash...
was.5 seconds better than
Wilma Rudolph's Olympic record...
set a decade ago.
And in baseball,
another record was set...
when ReggieJackson hit two...
consecutive grand
slam home runs...
in one inning...
to aid in the 16-1
undeniable slaughter...
ofhis former teammates.
Now, that's what I call
swingin'a big bat.
The weather
for Los Angeles and vicinity...
continued clear and warm,
light smog in the basin,
79 at the airport, 83 downtown,
and in KGYS-land,
watch out, Los Angeles...
89 degrees.
Smile so...
Oh... Oh!
KGYS You messed up again.
How about that ReggieJackson?
Reggie who?
He's a great baseball player.
Honey, baseball is not my game.
Well, do you know about...
Stay tuned to KGYS, soul support
in greater Los Angeles.
Remember, we're giving away
tickets toJ.B.'s big...

Take a sip.
Morning, Abdullah.
Where were you yesterday, Duane?
And you're late today,
Duane.
You'd better get off
of my case, Earl.

All right?
"Mohammed Akbar."
Hey, man,

You got a problem?
You need somethin'?

Just wondered if you was all right.
I'm all right, man.
Go to work.

Big... Big, black,
blond chick?
Red boots?
Blond, big,
black...
Yeah, black blond.
No.
Scruggy!
What's the matter, man?
You should be feeling great.
Look, I'm worried about Charlene.
I mean, maybe I should
call her or something.
I ain't ever stayed out
all night before.
It's not cool to
let a woman take you...
for granted, man.
Besides, you was terrific
last night.
That's another thing.
I got a burn down there now.
Suppose I caught somethin'...
Hey, this ain't funny.
Suppose I got the clap.
How am I gonna explain that?
Hey, man,
you ain't caught nothin'
but a case of the guilts.
Yeah?
A guilt burn?
This is J.B. Back on the case...

'Cause I would be the Fly.
But you still full of shit though.
You wouldn't talk to me like that...
if I was the Fly.
Oh, yes, I would,
because then you'd be
full of fly shit.
You know what else, man?
There ain't nothin' lower...

Not kangaroo shit,
elephant shit...
or chicken shit.
Ain't nothin' lower than fly shit.
You crazy, man.
I swear, I'll kill you man,

and you still wash cars by hand?
That's the feature
of this car wash...
we do it all by hand.
The personal touch.
Can't you read the sign?
I think you just too cheap
to put in machines.
Get out of here.
Beat it.

Away from the car!
Hippo, you got yourself

Oh, my God.
It's going to eat the paint out.
I told you,
for Mommy, to throw up...
away from the car.
Can you get it off

You'd better get out of there.

Here comes Daddy Rich
In his mean limousine
People come from everywhere
when he's on the scene...
"Clean"can't describe
The clothes he wears
He says all you got to do is believe
And you'll get your share
I went to Daddy Rich's church
last Sunday
There was, uh
wall-to-wall people there
Standing room only
Ayoung man jumped up
and accused Daddy Rich...
ofbein'a thief
Daddy Rich just smiled
And, uh, began to preach
He said I fear not those
Who do not like me
Whose car is that?
That belongs to the supreme...
black man, that's who.
Yeah, that's Daddy's car.
Daddy Rich.
You never watch him on TV?
Praise the Lord!
Praise the Lord!

Uh-huh?
Believe in that federal green.
'Cause money walks

because of a little pigeon shit...
on the trunk?
Not the car.
Just the spot.
Don't let the water
be hotter than 66.4.
Water? You'd better speak
to this gentleman.
Daddy Rich, ever since
I been following you,
I got a new house and a color TV.
Amen.
All right!
Praise the Lord.
Why don't you tell everybody
how you got so rich,
Daddy Rich?
This is one nigger

I'm hip to the game
you runnin' down...
on these people here.
What can I do for you,
brother?
The same thing you doin'
for everybody else... nothin'.
Hey, man, hey.!
Guess you don't believe
in my church... the Church...
of Divine Economic Spirituality.
Yeah, that's right.
I don't believe in it.
Then you don't believe in God.
- Not your God.
My God's doin' all right by me.
He sure is!
He's doin'
all right by me too!
Why don't you
climb on board, brother,

We promised you more
about the pop bottle bomber.
KGYS is first with the flash.
You got it.
Keep doin' it that way.
Live from Parker Center,
soul sister LaVonne Styles.
Come on in.
Hi, this is LaVonne Styles.
Oh. No, thank you.
I'm here at Parker Center talking to
Police Chief Dave Evis.
Chief Evis, have you been able
to identify the mad bomber?
Hi, Sam!
He's a short, nervous,
scraggly haired individual.
How you doin'?
Okay.
From eyewitness descriptions,
his principal weapon...
Mail call!
Seems to be a common pop bottle
that's filled with, oh,
you know, high explosives,
Thank you.
Capped with silver foil,
containing a fuse device.
From Parker Center,
this is LaVonne Styles for KGYS.
Uh, finito, honey.
Oh, thank you...
Lindy, you lightened...
your hair.
I love it.
What color is it?
It's supposed to be mango, honey,
but it's not right yet.
But wait till I get to
the school tonight.
Listen, Lindy,
I finally figured out how
I wanna have my nose done.
I was thinking of doing
ELizabeth Taylor...
from here to here...
and Olivia Newton-John
on the bottom.
What do you think?
- Flawless, honey.
Damn. Who is Earl to tell me to...
clean up that shit?
And then Geronimo's gonna
run off and leave me...
standin'there.
Wh... Who do they think...
Hey, Tall Chief,
lend me your ears.
Yeah, uh, run that by me again.
Lend me your ears.
Lend me your lips.
Ah, come on, man.
I ain't askin'
to sleep with your mama.
Have you ever seen me
give up my ears?
No, man, but...
Well, then, what
possessed you to even think...
to ask to borrow my ears?
This chick wants to
take my picture, man.
Just for a minute.
You gotta do better than that.
And "just for a minute"
ain't gonna get it either.
You gotta tell me somethin'.
Make me understand...
Well, it ain't every day
you can do somethin'
for a fellow American.
Midday in L.A.,
And don't get it all dirty.
And time for Rod McGrew
to do it to you.
Yeah, thank you, J.B.
This is your brother,
Rod McGrew.
Don't forget, stick around,
because later on...
we've got two tickets...
toJ.B.'s disco dance and show...
live at Howard's Grand Casino
Music Hall and Rib Shack.
It happens tonight.
Be there for the funkiest sounds
in town, like this...
Hey, Tall Chief,
thanks for the ears.
Oh, any time,
my friend.
The Five Spot got ribs today.
I'm gon' get me some ribs.
Ooh, yeah!
How 'bout y'all,
man?
Uh, how 'bout...
Abdullah, you want...
some ribs?
Man, I told you.
I don't eat meat.
I'm off the pig.
I eat natural foods,
not slave foods.
Is that all right with you?
Um, excuse me, brother,
but is ribs pig?
They had such a good time.
How do you know
Scruggs had a good time?
What did I do?
Shit, man!
What did I do?
She's crazy.
Got her brains...
in her lungs.
Then the bitch must be a genius!
Marsha, this is my lunch!
What'd you do with my ears, man?
Nothin'!
Looks like a nice lunch
you got there.
Geronimo.
Yeah?
What do you want?
I was just thinkin'.
Maybe I ought to
call Charlene, just to...
let her know I'm all right.
Scruggy, what I tell you
this morning?
It ain't cool for your old lady
to know where you are...
every minute of every day.
Tonight when you get home,
she's gonna be at the door...
with your pipe and slippers...
in that little negligee
you told me about.
It ain't good for her to know
that she can boss you around.
Well, I don't smoke a pipe
and I don't wear...
no slippers.
Scruggy, I'm the expert.
Right?
Take it from me. I've been
married three and a half times.
I should know, huh?
Hey, what the hell is going on...
around here, huh?
This is no playground.
We wash cars, huh?
We're on our lunch hour.
Then eat your lunch.
Go ahead.
You heard me.
You heard Mr. B.
That's all right, Chuko.
I'm gonna get you.
In your dreams, Pocahontas.

So please, talk later.
That's cool.
Irwin. Irwin!

Put your money

Or you ain't sayin'nothin'
Put your money
where your mouth is
Or you ain't sayin' a damn thing
Talk is cheap.
That's right, honey.
That is what is meant by
"a fall into the pit...
is a gain in your wit."
Irwin, who did you say
said all that?
Mao, man. Mao Tse-tung.
He's the head dude...

Mmm!
Marsha!
Will you please stop?
I mean, this is a place

My brother told me not

I told him he was crazy.
Now he can buy and sell me.
Enough!
Geronimo, man, I gotta win

Whoo! She's so fine.
Mmm!
Man, I got down with her.
Can you believe that?
I ever tell you?
Every day.
"And to overthrow
the reactionary...
ruling classes...
and therefore impossible
for the people to win power."
That's from ibid, page 150.
- Ibid?
Heavy rhetoric,
little boss.
Duane... I mean...
I mean, Abdullah.
You know what I'm
talking about. You know...
where I'm coming from.
Revolution is...
You wanna pick my brain,
right?
Right.
I'm gonna let you.
You know that revolution
you keep talkin' about...
all the time?
When it happens,
and it's gonna happen,
then you're gonna be
working here for real...
and not just playing around,
splashing in the water.
We get a chance
to run your white ass,
and you all get a chance
to sing "We Shall Overcome"
in Chinese.
Hey, man!
- That's not what I meant.
I'm so tired of you
runnin' off at your mouth.
It's gettin' me down,
honey.
Why don't you just leave
and be an assassin?
'Course the only thing
you're good at shootin' off...
is your big mouth.
Would you please
get out of my face,
you sorry-looking faggot?
Oh!
Who you calling...
sorry looking?
Can't y'all see that she ain't funny?
She's just another poor example...
of how the system has
of destroying our men.
Honey, I am more man
than you'll ever be...
and more woman
than you'll ever get.
Shit.
- All right.
I want to see you get down
I want to see you get down

It took me two days to go.
I had this operation,
and the doctor...
l-I'll handle this.
L-I'll handle this.
I'll handle it.
I was just taking
that sample to the doctor.
It took me two days to go.
I had this operation...
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

I mean, I can't replace it.
But here's a little something
to take care of everything.
And the car wash...
the car wash is on the house.
How 'bout my-my pants?
It'll all be taken care of.
Hey, Mr. B, why don't you

We'll find it.
Why don't you fix...
the wheel?
Earl, see that
that stuff is cleaned up.
Hey, fellas.
Wash the cars!
Look, come with me.
Come with me?
You know who that was?
The pee bottle bomber.
I just don't understand white folk.
Hey, man.
Ain't that Sonny Fredricks...
over there?
Yeah. We got a little deal workin'.
Thought you wasn't
hanging out with him...
no more.
What's the matter?
He ain't good enough...
for you?
He ain't good enough
because he's an ex-con?
You're forgettin' something.
I ain't forgettin' nothin'.
Then you just lay off
me and my friends.
At least he didn't
bust no head open on no...
gas station attendant.
Hey, don't push it,
Abdullah.
What are ya doin',
Marsha?
What?
Why-Why are you
closing the door?
It's so noisy out here.
I thought it might disturb you.
Hey, you're a sweet girl,
Marsha.
With the gas,
that's 5.50.
What's your name?
- Marsha.
Hi. I'm Kenny.
- Hi.
Here's your change.
And here's your rain check.
You get a free car wash if it rains.
What if it rains today?
Then come back tomorrow.
What if I can't wait until tomorrow?
Let's say I come back
tonight around... 6:00.
It would be too late.
You couldn't get...
your car washed then.
Yeah, but let's say
I was to come back...
at 6:00 anyway.
Hey, come on,
would you?
Ooh-whee-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Together
Forever, me and you

For what, man?
Over 37 parking violations...

Oh, I gave my sister-in-law
the money this morning...
to pay it all.
Is there any other way
we can straighten this out,
Officer?
I gave a certified check.
I would've brought it myself,
but I had to go to work.
Tell it to the judge.
Wait a minute!
I would've brought
the check myself!
Hey, Slide, are you
going to the slammer?
Hey, look!
Call my sister
at the May Company.
Better not look in his locker...
See you on visitin' day!

Get back to work.
