628 Tremont.
6-2-8. Three dead.
No, just the usual. Fuck. Usual.
It's no big deal these days, right?
Some guy...
What's his name? I don't know.
Oh, who knows his name?
Who cares?
Fucking' shoots his wife and kid,
and then eats the fucking licorice.
Sticks it in his mouth
and blows his own brains out.
- This guy had no ID...
- Shit.
...no fucking papers.
Probably squirreled
over the goddamn border.
Hey, guys. Channel 10 News.
Listen, you're kind of blocking our shot.
- Can I get you to move forward a bit?
- Yeah, sure.
Thanks. You ready?
Yeah. Almost. Two minutes.
Let's grab some more B-roll.
Can't get close enough for an Emmy.
Screw the Emmy.
I'd settle for a fucking paycheck.
Story of my life.
<i>We downloaded this video off the Net</i>
<i>sometime over the last three days.</i>
<i>I can't remember exactly when.</i>
Look at this guy.
Look at this fucking guy.
Chowing down while his buddies are
shoving a corpse in the back of the van.
- Okay, I'm ready. Let's do it.
- Some of this footage
- was never broadcast.
- Am I good?
<i>It was secretly uploaded
by the cameraman who shot it.</i>
<i>- It was his way of trying to tell the truth...
- She's alive.</i>
<i>...about what was happening.</i>
Bree Reno reporting live from Homestead,
where tragedy befell an immigrant family.
An unidentified man has shot his wife
and 16-year-old son to death
- before turning the gun on himself.
- Hey, what's going on?
- Jesus!
- What?
- I don't believe this.
- What? Is there something with the camera?
- Just fix it.
- She's still moving.
Oh, for Christ's sake, Brody.
I'm right in the middle of a...
- What?
- Jesus-fucking-Christ!
- For God's sakes!
- What the hell is going on over there?
- I thought they were dead.
- They're supposed to be. They are...
I don't know! She's moving
on the frickin' gurney, man!
Get out of the way!
Come on! Get out of the way!
Backup here! Backup here!
- Aah!
- Get off of him!
He all right?
Jesus! What the fuck is that?
Just keep still.
The other one's moving!
The other one's coming up, too!
No!
Take him out!
He's not going down!
He's not going down!
Holy shit!
Bree!
Shoot her in the head!
No. No.
This can't be happening.
This can't be fucking happening!
<i>We downloaded a lot of what we found</i>
<i>on television, on the Net, off blogs...</i>
<i>images and commentary
over those first three days.</i>
<i>Most of it was bullshit.</i>
<i>None of it was useful.</i>
<i>This is what we were getting
from the news networks.</i>
None of us can claim to know
exactly what has caused the chaos
we've been experiencing.
Some kind of germ.
Some kind of epidemic.
A natural calamity or...
You can't talk about it
being an epidemic.
You talk about it being an epidemic,
there's gonna be panic in the streets.
<i>I'm old enough to remember
Orson Welles' War of the Worlds,</i>
possibly the greatest hoax
every perpetrated.
There's a dead guy sitting up!
And that was when it was just radio.
Now it's 24/7.
This is some kind of hoax.
This is ridiculous!
People are willing to
believe almost anything.
<i>We made a film...</i>
<i>the one I'm going to show you now.</i>
<i>Actually, Jason was the one
who wanted to make it.</i>
<i>Like that cameraman from Channel 10,</i>
<i>he wanted to upload it
so that people... you...</i>
<i>could be told the truth.</i>
<i>The film was shot
with a Panasonic HDX-900</i>
<i>and a HBX-200.</i>
<i>I did the final cut on Jason's laptop.</i>
<i>I've added music occasionally for effect,
hoping to scare you.</i>
<i>You see, in addition to trying
to tell you the truth,</i>
<i>I am hoping to scare you</i>
<i>so that maybe you'll wake up.</i>
<i>Maybe you won't make any of the same
mistakes that we made.</i>
<i>Anyway, here it is,</i>
<i>Jason Creed's The Death of Death.</i>
Help me.
Aah!
No. Cut, cut.
- Cut.
- Come on!
How many times have I told you?
Dead things don't move fast.
You're a corpse, for Christ's sakes.
If you run that fast,
your ankles are gonna snap off.
If she's going fast, I have to go fast,
Otherwise, how am I
supposed to catch her?
You're supposed to catch her later.
This is the beginning
of the fucking movie.
You catch her now, it's all over.
All you're supposed to do
is grab her dress so...
So my tits fall out?
Ain't gonna happen.
You know, can somebody
please explain to me
why girls in scary movies
always have to, like,
fall down and lose their shoes and shit?
It's totally lame.
And why do we always have to
get our dresses torn off?
Actually, I'm looking
forward to that part.
- Flashing.
- I swear.
- Thanks.
- Should've stuck with auto repair.
Aw, shit, man. Look at this.
Your makeup's all unglued.
Give me a break.
Yeah, maybe you can see it now
because you're in way too tight.
All he's supposed to do
is run through the fucking shot.
No, not run. Shamble.
The script says, "The mummy
shambles into frame and stops. "
For a second. For one second.
You're telling me
in one second you can see...
The camera can see. And what the camera
sees, the audience will see.
What fucking audience?
There's always an audience for horror...
believable horror.
But who's gonna believe a mummy
if his makeup's all unglued?
Who's gonna believe
a mummy in the first place?
Here's a thought, genius:
Try zooming out.
Maybe your fucking shot will work.
I know what I want here, Tony,
and I know what I'm doing.
That's right. You do, don't you?
We're only, what, four days
over a three-day shooting schedule?
Guys, there's something weird going on.
Don't even get fucking credits
for what we're doing out here.
You'll all be in the credits.
I'm talking about college credits.
Leave those to me.
Did we get the shot yet?
No, we're still dicking around.
Five credits for each of you.
That is a pledge.
Mr. Creed has a vision.
Hey, I'm just trying to make
a scary movie here.
But you are, Mr. Creed.
Jason always wanted to be
a documentary filmmaker.
But for his
senior class project,
he decided to try
to make a horror film.
That's what he was shooting
on that first night,
the night when...
everything changed.
Stupid fucking
mummy movie.
With an underlying threat
of social satire.
Jason, can I take a minute?
I have to pee.
- Shit!
- Uh, Jason?
- What?
- I have to pee, too.
Jesus Christ!
This whole thing is falling apart.
Hey, guys, uh, there's something on the news.
It's pretty... Well, I mean...
you might wanna check this out.
It's difficult for us to believe
what we've been reporting,
but it does seem to be happening.
Two news agencies in two separate counties
in the Tri-State area
are reporting accounts
of the dead returning to life.
In one of the cases... the one in Somerset...
the dead man, identified
as a 50-year-old white male,
the victim of a drive-by shooting yesterday,
sat up on an autopsy table
and actually attacked
Somerset medical examiner
Thomas Maitland...
- Horseshit.
- Shut up, Tony. It's on the fucking news.
The news is always horseshit.
Always make things sound
worse than they really are.
That's how they sell soap.
The next morning, what happens?
"Oh, sorry. Our mistake. "
I mean, seriously, who's gonna believe
this shit? Two dead people...
Now five dead people.
And here's another.
They're coming in from everywhere.
A corpse at Hope Memorial
has apparently revived.
That's six separate reports...
Six? How could there be six mistakes?
For Christ's sake,
we hear this sort of thing every day.
We got hurricanes
'cause the planet's getting too hot.
And terrorists...
They're gonna drop a dirty bomb
on the White House or on your house.
And somebody's gonna put some germ
in your water or in your mailbox.
That letter from
Publishers Clearing House, huh?
Good news is you won a million bucks.
Bad news is you're gonna
wake up dead tomorrow morning.
Better believe what we've just heard.
The problem doesn't seem to be
that people are waking up dead,
but that dead people are waking up.
Shh! Listen.
- What's that?
- What was that?
If this is some kind of Halloween prank
or some sort of hoax,
a lot of people are in on it,
- including officials...
- I'm out of here.
If I'm gonna wake up dead,
it's gonna be in my own bedroom.
You can all come.
Eliot has the address.
He knows where it is.
Yeah. Nice place, too.
Cozy. Takes up about half of Philadelphia.
Yeah, it's a fucking fortress.
I can't get in unless I'm invited.
Sorry, Jason, about your movie.
I don't mean to hang
you up or anything,
but I'm getting the fuck out of here.
Like I said, you can all come.
I mean it. It's an invitation.
Late this afternoon,
the cadaver began to move.
- I'm in.
- Showed no vital signs,
- but it opened its eyes...
- Anyone else?
- Apparently not.
- How is that possible?
The man must not have been dead.
Well, he's dead. Partially dissected.
Bye, guys.
Fuckin' mummies get all the girls.
So... what are we gonna do?
The cadaver began to move.
But how do you explain...
As a medical man,
I have no explanation.
I tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna go to the dorm.
Deb's there. Whatever's happening,
I don't want her to be alone.
...able to transmit electrical impulses
strong enough to animate
what little remained
of the body's muscle and tissue.
Okay.
Okay, this is the women's dorm.
Jesus!
It's been 25 minutes
since we heard the news.
It already looks like everybody's gone.
Hello. Who's in there?
Oh, man.
What the fuck are you doing here?
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- I'm just stealing shit.
But you...
What's a guy with a video camera
doing in the women's dorm, huh?
Security!
Heh heh heh heh!
Oh, man.
Oh, God.
Oh, shit.
Okay. Okay.
This is Deb's room.
Oh, Jesus! It's okay, Deb! It's me.
Jesus-fucking...
Are you still shooting?
- Why are you shooting?
- I'm just...
We have reports coming in from Denver.
Oh, my God.
- God, I was so freaked.
- It's okay, babe.
We have incredible footage
from Channel 10.
I'm here. I'm here.
I've been trying to call home
for, like, an hour.
First exclusive footage
that shows evidence of dead people,
or supposedly dead people, reviving.
Jesus! What the fuck is that?
Oh, my God. The other one's coming up, too.
Shit! Shit!
Same fucking thing! No answer!
- Gotta get out there. I'm missing everything.
- Babe.
- What?
- There's no answer at my house.
My mom, my dad, Billy...
They're supposed to be there.
Maybe they're up at the cabin.
No, I already tried there. And their cell.
He was walking really strange.
<i>Due to unusual volume,</i>
<i>your call did not go through as dialed.</i>
Circuits are busy.
Your folks probably can't
get through to you, either.
<i>It was all over the news, all over the Web,</i>
<i>but no one knew
what was really happening.</i>
I want to get out of here.
Jay, I want to go home.
He shot Ben!
I think that's what started the panic:
Not knowing the truth.
We're in a war zone,
but I don't know who the war is with.
What's been happening is real, not a hoax,
and prospects truly are terrifying.
<i>All my friends left</i>
<i>before we could even say good-bye.</i>
...numbers of citizens...
- We want everyone to remain calm.
<i>It's funny. You spend so much time
resenting your parents,</i>
<i>separating yourself, building your own life.</i>
<i>But as soon as the shit hits the fan,</i>
<i>the only place you want to go is home.</i>
We're in Mary's Winnebago,
trying to stick together.
- What is this about, Jason?
- I don't know. I just...
If this turns out to be a big thing,
I just want to record it, okay?
Come on. Everybody,
when it comes to you, say your name.
This is ridiculous.
Mary. Mary Dexter.
And what are you doing here, Mary?
Um, going home.
Trying to go home.
Can you just not film me
while I'm driving, please, so I can focus?
- Say your name.
- Jason, if you don't know by name by now,
then get your clothes
out of my closet, okay?
- Come on, babe. It's part of history.
- His...
Debra Moynahan.
And I'm just trying to get
home, too, okay? Like Mary.
And I'm wondering why my boyfriend
has a camera plastered to his face.
Scranton, okay?
Scranton, Pennsylvania.
That's my home.
My parents' home.
And my little brother's.
Where are you coming from?
College.
We're all at Pitt together.
University of Pittsburgh.
- Why are we on the road?
- Christ.
Yeah. Christ, Jason. Lay the fuck off.
See this guy?
He won't say who he is, so I will.
He's Tony Ravello, who's from...
Where is it? Brooklyn? Or the Bronx?
Queens.
He does makeup that comes unglued.
You know what?
I'm a directing major, just like you.
I wasn't even supposed
to do makeup.
No, I was.
Sorry, babe.
You know what happens
when we try to work together.
I hear that.
What are we doing
out here on the road?
Uh, just trying to get
out of Dodge right now.
Why?
What do you want me to say, Jason?
No, it's not what I want you to say.
It's what you want to say. Tell us.
Why does everyone want to
get the hell out of Dodge?
'Cause of this thing...
- this crazy thing that's happening.
- It is crazy.
Where are you going, Tony?
Nowhere. No place to go.
So I'm just gonna hang
with you, Jason,
until I can't take any more of your shit.
- Got it.
- Will you explain
why the Department
of Homeland Security
suddenly raised its alert level
to orange earlier this evening,
even though there are no indications
of a terrorist attack?
You're right. There's no indication
of any terrorism.
We believe these are simply isolated
and unrelated phenomena,
and we expect things
to return to normal very soon.
See? Already starting
to play the shit down.
The Center for Disease Control
believes this may be due
to a previously unknown viral strain
that leads to a kind of mass psychosis.
Psychosis.
Who's gonna believe that?
- Psychotics.
- The president continues
to monitor the situation from his ranch,
and he's asked the American people
to remain vigilant.
Say who you are, Eliot.
You just did. I'm Eliot.
Tell us more.
Eliot Stone, Harrisburg, PA,
and I'm here with
you fine people because...
I don't know... I'd like to get home, too.
It's on the way.
I'm hoping you'll be so kind
as to drop me off.
Seems like everybody
wants to get home.
I know what you're trying to do, Jason.
I get it.
Gordo Thorson, Danville, Pennsylvania.
Tracy Thurmond.
We're, uh... We're together.
Forever.
Uh, yeah. We'll see.
What's that?
Oh, this is my camera.
Smile.
Thermon and Thorson.
Give me a kiss.
Oh, and I'm from San Anton'.
That's in Texas.
Don't mess with Texas.
Holy shit. Look at this guy.
Christ.
He's gotta be doing, like, a buck-20.
Professor.
Ah, you've finally come to me.
I was beginning to feel neglected.
It's just that you're...
So far away, I know. In steerage.
Sitting on a toilet seat
with everyone's dirty laundry.
Oh, Andrew Maxwell, emeritus.
Nowhere to go, nothing to do,
and I'm not with anybody.
That was Ravello just
popping along for the ride.
I'm not with anyone, either.
I'm just here all alone.
Just me and St. Chris.
I think we'll be calling
on old St. Chris before this night's over.
Oh, my God! Look!
We'll never get past that.
Turn around. We should
go back to the dorms.
Look!
It's a cop. A state trooper.
How do you know that?
Oh, his hat. His hat...
His stupid-looking hat.
He looks hurt.
- He's all burned up.
- Yeah.
He's not just burned,
he's fucking fried!
He shouldn't even be walking.
- Oh, my...
- He's dead.
God damn it!
I'm telling you, he can't
be anything else but dead.
- Oh, my God!
- Jesus! Fucking drive!
I think he wants more
than your license and registration!
- Go! Go...
- My God!
Fuck!
Wait. Before you go, wait, wait.
What's that? What's that?
What are we doing?
What time is it?
It's almost 3.
I think we should pull over.
How do you feel?
Mary, how do you feel
about what just happened?
How do you think I feel?
They were already dead, okay?
You didn't do anything wrong.
Listen to me, unless
you're Jesus-fucking-Christ,
you don't stand up
and walk around after you're dead!
Would you shut up?
We might've just killed
three people back there.
All right? Three living,
breathing people like us.
No, we didn't.
I did.
I did.
Sorry.
Shit!
We've stopped somewhere off the road.
God knows where.
Aren't you gonna go say something?
I don't know, man.
I'll just give her some time, you know?
I'm running low.
I'd like to make it to a state store
before they all shut their doors forever.
God, there's a terrible thought.
A world where a gentleman
can't buy a bottle of bourbon.
God.
Mary? Mary?
No! What did she do?
What the fuck did she do?
Anyone know she had a gun?
Why would she do this?
Because of what happened?
Those people back there?
This is our fault.
For panicking, for turning this into...
Into what?
Into something it's not.
Into something more than this is.
This is all just bullshit!
You keep calling this bullshit,
someone else is gonna
kill themselves!
You heard the TV.
Mary heard the TV.
We all should've just stayed at school
instead of driving around
in the middle of nowhere
knocking fucking people off
like bowling pins!
- She's still alive.
- What?
She's got a pulse.
- Fuck. Pressure. Pressure.
- Mary.
- Looks like everyone's left.
- Yeah, left in a hurry.
It's a hospital.
Where else she supposed to go?
Just because we can't see anybody
doesn't mean no one's here.
Maybe they're hiding.
Yeah, maybe they're hiding
'cause they think we're dead.
Hello! We're not dead!
Cut it out, Tony.
Wait, wait, wait. Where are we going?
You guys look for a doctor.
We're gonna find the E.R.
Hello? Is anyone here?
Wait, I think I hear somebody.
It's down here. Come on.
It's just the radio.
We just saw some in the location...
Hello?
- Is anyone...
- Shh. Shh.
What?
...coming away from the building,
what's wrong?
He wants to stay here
'cause we can't move.
Stand by. Stand by.
It's complete chaos.
It's complete fucking chaos.
I got him.
I know I got him!
Gotta go for the head.
No, you gotta go for the head.
Tell everyone out there
you gotta get them in the head.
This isn't some sort of mistake?
This is a hospital.
There's nobody here.
What if it is for real?
What about Mary?
What if...
she dies?
We're not doing any good
just standing around here.
Fuck. Losing juice.
Let's see if we can find some help.
- There's somebody.
- Excuse me.
Excuse me.
We have an emergency.
Our friend is hurt, and we need help.
Oh, my God.
What's wrong with him?
He's dead,
that's what's wrong with him.
Use the gun.
- Oh, God.
- Hurry, use the gun.
What if there's others?
- Guys?
- Try the head.
- Try the head.
- Yeah, shoot him in the head.
Shoot him in the head!
Fuck. Battery's almost dead.
- Yeah, that's not all.
- What do you mean?
What is going on?
Jesus. A nurse.
Dead doctor, dead nurse.
Makes sense, doesn't it?
Let's fucking hurry up. Gordo!
It's jammed.
- Okay, I'm gonna try something.
- Try what?
Get her attention.
Just try and get her attention.
- Come over here.
- Hey!
- Come after me.
- Be careful, Debra.
Careful.
Shock assigned.
Jesus H...
Christ.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Those are hot.
Put them back where you found them.
We got to get her a doctor.
Yeah, a live one.
I got it.
Let's go.
No, leave her here with me.
What, you're not coming with us?
I can't. I gotta plug in.
Leave it. Let it charge.
I can't. I can't leave
without the camera.
The camera's the whole thing.
Getting help is the whole thing.
I should be with them.
Maybe I could help.
I can't.
I can't...
because...
I'm fucking plugged in.
Some shit, huh?
Left alone with these fucking dead guys.
I'm sorry, Mary.
If anything Tony said or I said or did
made you...
People you killed were dead.
These people are dead.
At least they look dead.
I don't know,
the way things are...
who the fuck knows?
Mary.
Mary?
Shit.
Guys?
Guys, what's happening?
Fuck. God damn it.
Hello?
Hello.
I found this in one of the other rooms.
Tell us your name.
Uh...
Say it.
- Deb, come on.
- Say it.
Give me a break.
Jay... Jason.
- Jason Creed.
- You see how it feels
to have a camera shoved in your face?
To have to answer stupid questions
when people are dying all around you?
You see how it feels?
Deb, just put the thing down
and tell me what happened.
Well, you missed it.
If it didn't happen on camera,
it's like it didn't happen, right?
There was a...
There was a patient
in one of the other rooms.
He looked nice, you know?
Not dead.
But he was.
He was almost on top
of me before I saw him.
It was Gordo who shot him.
Jesus, did you...
- I mean, did he...
- Hurt me?
No.
Well, who was screaming?
Me.
You want me to show you how?
For the camera?
For history?
Aah!
That's enough, Deb. L...
Aah!
Oh, God.
I just shot another man.
I've killed three men and a woman
in the last half hour.
It came easily, too, didn't it?
I remember the war.
In wartime,
killing comes easily,
especially when you don't
have to do any of it.
There will always be people like you,
wanting to document,
wanting to record some sort of diary.
Me? You're the one
who put the camera in my hands.
You're the one
who made me want to do this.
Not this. This is a diary of cruelty.
And in wartime,
when the enemy can be marked
as this son of a bitch
or that son of a bitch,
then cruelty...
becomes justified.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Look at Mary.
She's... She's dead.
She's turning.
This is, like, too much.
Too much.
Guys, I don't know.
Give it to me.
You can't do this. Give me the gun.
Oh, man.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
You're stuttering, Mr. Creed.
Don't try to speak, just shoot.
Shoot your picture. Shoot for as long as
your hard drive holds out.
As long as you have power.
Take this.
It's too easy to use.
Let's get out of here.
<i>It's interesting how quickly we find out</i>
<i>what we're capable of becoming.</i>
<i>Up until that night,
we had lived predictable lives.</i>
<i>Now...</i>
<i>we would never be able to predict
what might happen next.</i>
<i>God had changed the rules on us.</i>
<i>And surprisingly,
we were playing along.</i>
What the...
Jesus, Gordo! Look out!
Aah!
What? What happened?
You think they're not dead?
Huh, Tony?
Tell me this guy isn't dead...
...after I jam him through the
heart with a fucking I.V. Pole!
Jesus! Oh, regular fucking die, huh?
You think he's not dead?
Do you get it, Tony?
Do you finally fucking understand?
- What happened?
- It hurts.
Bite.
It hurts.
Here, take this. It's too easy to use.
Come on, Deb,
you used to shoot better than me.
Yeah, that's why I stopped.
I don't want to become you.
<i>There are currently more</i>
<i>than 200 million video cameras
in people's hands worldwide.</i>
<i>Blogs, video windows,
and streaming videos...</i>
Now, there's too much information.
<i>...are indicating more
than 40 million visitors a month.</i>
Where do you go to find the truth?
Is it your job as a journalist
to just keep shooting?
Those of us in the media
put ourselves ahead
of what we see happening...
There were no weapons
of mass destruction.
Millions of them are out there,
driven, compelled to broadcast
their particular views of things.
<i>Compelled, like the man said,</i>
<i>Jason was compelled.</i>
<i>I had never seen him like that before.</i>
<i>What is it?</i>
<i>What gets into our heads
when we see something horrible?</i>
<i>A horrible accident on the highway.</i>
<i>Something keeps us
from just driving on.</i>
<i>Something holds us.</i>
<i>But we don't stop to help.</i>
<i>We stop to look.</i>
It's our first morning
since we hit the road.
We're here to say good-bye.
I don't understand why he died.
It was just a bite. How could
someone die from one little bite?
Maybe it's some kind
of poison or something.
Maybe it is a virus.
Anyone gets bit comes back
as one of them.
No, anyone who dies comes
back as one of them.
Thurmond and Thorson.
No. No.
No.
We gotta bury him, right?
How would you feel waking up
under 6 feet of dirt?
Can't we just wait?
Can't we just at least wait and see?
Maybe it won't happen to him.
Please?
Can we just wait?
<i>Due to unusual volume,
your call did not go through as dialed.</i>
Hey, you guys, we gotta get going.
- I gotta get...
- Get home?
Yeah.
Although after this,
who knows what we're gonna find?
Your folks will be fine, Deb.
They're smart people, like you.
Oh, shit. Look.
Poor Gordo. He just flunked out.
...and the rock will not hide you.
The dead tree will give no shelter.
Can you say amen?
These are the end of times.
And for the sinner
there will be no end,
only the death that will not die,
and the hunger that will not be satisfied.
Get on your knees.
Get on your knees.
Get on your fucking knees.
Here is
a Channel 11 News update.
<i>It wasn't until we uploaded this footage</i>
<i>that we saw how bad everything was.</i>
Don't try to come into any major city,
where there are reports of violence,
looting, killing.
Small towns tonight
are like ghost towns,
as most people have fled
for their lives,
believing that this might be the beginning
of some sort of Armageddon.
<i>Using country roads,</i>
<i>we hadn't run into any riots or looting.</i>
<i>But we were about to run
into something else.</i>
Turn, old piece of shit.
Oh, my God. I knew
it was gonna break down.
It's all right.
It's all right. We could fix it.
God couldn't fix it.
...lock yourself inside.
Don't trust anyone,
not even those you love.
I think it's the fuel line.
If that's what it is, I can fix it.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
I know what I'm doing.
Daddy used to pit crew for Dale.
- Earnhardt?
- Gerber.
Who the hell's Dale Gerber?
We can't stay out here, guys.
We gotta get the Winnie
inside that barn.
I'm gonna go see if the owner is home.
You might not want to do
that. There might be...
Oh, shit.
Whoa, whoa, stop.
I don't think he's dead.
L... He might not be dead.
Who are 'ou?
Who are you?
He's asking us who we are.
Great.
Our car broke down. We need help.
Oh.
No, we don't need a car.
We just need to fix ours.
- We need to use your barn.
- Oh.
- "Hurry. " Why?
- What?
- Oh, shit!
- Lord!
They must have been following us.
Oh, my Lord.
Tony, how many bullets you got left?
Where did he go?
Jesus Christ.
I thought the Amish were friendly folk.
Yep. Gas line's leaking.
I'm gonna cut the line
below the tear,
and get her hooked back up to the post.
Thanks.
What is that?
Guys, what's all that screaming?
Birthday Party.
Where did you find this?
It was on the camera
that Deb found in the hospital.
Surprise!
Bupkus is here.
Don't be afraid, Gina.
I think she's afraid of his nose.
That's the guy.
The one in the orange shirt.
That's the guy from the hospital.
The one I thought looked nice.
Honk-honk.
The one Gordo shot.
Aah!
What's that?
Guys, what's that?
They're in the back, at the back wall.
It's not as if they're out front as well.
What the hell is going on out there?
Jesus Christ.
God, there's a party out there.
Oh! Shit!
There seems to be some sort of trap door.
I'm hurrying.
Can we get our asses
out of here?
Not to apply unnecessary pressure,
but we are all
relying on you, darling.
Oh, my God. The door's open.
Shh. I hear something.
Maybe one of them got in already.
Maybe more than one.
Guys, what is happening?
We're all right!
We're all right.
- Almost there.
- I certainly hope so, darling,
as much as I love
spending time with you.
Aah!
Tracy, I love you.
All right! Open the door!
Open up, Tony. Let's go.
You see how many there are?
Look how many.
Come on.
Come on, come on.
Gentlemen, hurry.
Aah!
- Oh, my God.
- It's all right.
There's nothing
we can do for him. Let's go.
- But...
- They're gonna be all over us. Let's go!
It's estimated that
if something isn't done
to stop the slaughter
within three more days,
our death rate will quadruple.
Within 10 days,
it will have risen by 100%.
<i>Before there were...</i>
<i>I don't know how many people
died every minute...</i>
<i>8, 10, 20?</i>
<i>Now there were five times
as many, ten times,</i>
<i>a hundred times as many.</i>
<i>Dead but walking.</i>
<i>There weren't enough bullets
to stop them all.</i>
They are monsters.
Monsters who prey
on the flesh of the living.
We needed supplies.
Gas.
Without gas,
we weren't going anywhere.
There might be more of them around.
Think we can make it?
We've gotta try.
Get in, fill up, get out fast.
Yeah, but what if...
- Put the gun down.
- Who the hell are you?
Don't matter who I am.
All that matters is what I got.
What he's got's
better than yours, Tony. Way better!
Damn right. There here
is an M-16 semi-auto
with the safety turned off.
And I'm just trying to decide,
do I pump two bullets into your brain
or just one?
No, we're cool.
Good choice.
Now who the hell are y'all?
Some kind of newspeople?
No. Students.
University of Pittsburgh.
Damn rounders from town gone crazy.
- Come on.
- Come on? Where?
Anyplace is better than this, ain't it?
Come on, before we get
our asses shot off!
...always arguing about immigration.
Let them in, keep them out,
lock your door
and throw away the key.
We've come here
concerned about people
crossing the border into our country.
But that's not the problem anymore.
The problem
is all those creatures crossing the border
between life and death.
Y'all ready for some boxes over there, man?
What the hell's with
that camera anyway?
Uh, home movies.
Who's gonna be left to watch?
So what's up with y'all?
What the hell you doing
in my town?
We're trying to get to Scranton,
but we need fuel.
We were using those pumps
back there at the gas station.
Them pumps is dry.
We siphoned off all the gas.
- Can we buy some of what you took?
- Buy?
Girl, if this keeps up,
money ain't gonna be worth nothing.
Talking about gas, yeah,
I'll let you have some.
Enough to get you where you're going.
What's with you all?
How come you stuck around?
'Cause we got the power.
For the first time in our lives,
we got the power
'cause everybody else left.
All the folks without suntans.
They'll be back, right?
The Army? National Guard?
Somebody's gotta put
all this shit back together.
The National Guard.
Kid, I'm in the National Guard.
Anyway, no one's coming
upon nothing together.
That's why we got all this shit.
Anything worth anything under one roof.
- It's called looting.
- No, ma'am.
It's called doing what you gotta do.
Can I get online?
Back there.
Uh, excuse me.
It's all right. Let him through.
Let him through.
In fact,
law enforcement authorities
and a reporter was on the scene.
Here's Homestead Chief
of Police Arthur Katz.
These attacks was carried out
by a bunch of illegal immigrants
was mistakenly pronounced dead
before the attacks took place.
The only time they was dead
was when my guys shot 'em.
They changed it. They recut it.
<i>The media were lying to us,</i>
<i>or the government was lying to them.</i>
<i>They were trying to make it seem
like everything was gonna be all right.</i>
- What are you doing?
- I just want to shoot us while we're editing.
- Oh.
- I want to cover everything.
<i>Now I can understand</i>
<i>why Jason was so anxious
to upload his own footage.</i>
<i>- Okay.
- At the time, I didn't get it.</i>
Right there, we'll cut
to the angle from your camera.
- Look!
- Perfect.
- Put the gun down.
- Who the hell are you?
Don't matter who I am.
All that matters is what I got.
And after that, we drove here?
Yeah. It sure would be nice
to have the surveillance
camera angle
from when we drove in.
Figured as much. Got it.
They're recording all the security cameras.
It's like a 7-Eleven in here.
I got it all cued up for you.
- Oh, you're fucking brilliant, man.
- Why, thank you.
What'd you do,
get it off the recorders?
It's a wireless system.
Pretty sophisticated.
So sophisticated that I was
easily able to rip it off
right out of the air.
Beautiful. This is excellent.
What the hell are you guys doing?
Uh, editing.
Editing what?
The stuff we shot.
When you said you want to get online,
I thought you wanted to, like, get
in touch with your dad or something?
No, I just wanted to upload our shit.
Look, 72,000 hits...
in eight minutes.
Hey, Eliot, can we have a moment, please?
Yeah.
- Is his camera on?
- Yeah.
If we're gonna have a conversation,
I'm sure you'd like to have it on tape.
If it's not on camera,
it's like it never happened, right?
Okay, Jay, listen to me.
I'm trying to get home
to my family, okay?
Everyone out there is trying to get home.
And you're in here dicking around
on your computer.
<i>It was a pretty one-sided conversation.</i>
72,000 hits.
They're coming in from all over the world.
They're not getting the
truth from anybody else.
All that shit on the news
is a pack of lies.
72,000 hits in eight minutes.
- That's unbelievable.
- Congratulations. You're famous.
That's not what it's about.
Would you rather have people
not knowing what's going on in the world?
We might even be able to save
somebody's fucking life here.
72,000 hits.
In another hour, it'll probably be a million.
By tomorrow, who knows?
All over the world,
people learning how to survive
by seeing how we manage to survive.
You always know
how to make a good argument, Jay.
Oh, my God.
Text message from my little brother.
Whoa. What's it say?
All this time I've
been imagining them dead in our house,
and they're not even home.
They went camping four days ago.
"Driving home. All okay.
Hope you are, too. "
Sent last night. "Driving home. "
That means they're probably
gonna beat us there.
I told you they were safe.
They're on the road, same as us.
They're not safe, but they're still alive.
Pack your shit.
I'm gonna go check on that gas.
Yo, dude.
Where are you, man?
Ridley, yo back at you.
We're in the middle
of fucking nowhere out here.
How's Deb?
Uh, she's okay.
You know, coping.
Look, if you need anything,
like a place to chill, whatever,
get your ass down here, man!
We're having a blast!
Hi, Jay! Love you!
What's up?
I don't know.
Something's going on.
One of my men had a bad heart.
He died.
Thing is we don't know where he went.
This shit ain't freaking you out, though.
We talking about this nigga Charlie, man.
Shit.
Maybe we should get
inside and lock the door.
I'm gonna go get Jason.
Stay. I'll go.
Wait, wait.
That thing could be inside there.
That thing can be anywhere.
Fuck.
$100,000 education,
I can't find my way
out of a fucking warehouse.
Exit. Exit.
What the fuck was that?
Oh, fuck.
Fuck.
Fuck.
- Where the hell have you been?
- What?
There's a dead guy
walking around. Let's go.
Wait. Say that again. I didn't get it.
There is a dead guy
walking around. Now let's go.
...were killing and eating their victims,
prompting authorities to examine
the bodies of some of the victims.
Medical authorities in Cumberland
have concluded that in all cases
the killers are eating flesh
of the people they murder.
Repeating this latest bulletin
just received moments ago
from Cumberland, Maryland...
- Civil Defense authorities...
- It's all clear.
...that murders victims,
new evidence of having
been partially devoured
by their murderers.
Medical examination...
Turn that TV off!
All right.
Everyone with a heartbeat,
freeze and shut up.
Son of a bitch. Where are we?
Fuck.
Shh. Shh.
Fuck me!
Okay. All right. We're good.
That... That's the door. Let's go.
- Whoa! It's us!
- It's cool.
- Okay?
- Shut the fuck up!
I see him! I see him over there, yo!
Over here! Over here!
Yo, come on! We got him!
I think we got him! We got him! Yeah!
Over here. Over here. Move it!
Oh! Shit!
- It's not him.
- That's not Troy?
Son of a...
bitch.
Fuck off.
I got him! I got him!
No! Don't shoot!
Those barrels are full of gas.
- Oh!
- Damn!
What the hell is that stuff?
- Whoa!
- God!
That's enough.
No need to fill the tank.
Scranton's only 65 miles away.
We could really use some weapons.
Food, canned goods, water.
Um, lip gloss?
The lip gloss you can have.
The rest of this shit is ours.
All of it?
Every last can of peas.
Well, what if we said we're not leaving
till we get what we need?
What would you do, kill us?
I'd think about it.
But I don't think you'd do it, though.
It's easier just to give us
what we need, isn't it?
'Cause otherwise, guess what,
you're gonna have to kill us.
- Deb.
- Shut up, Jay.
You're gonna have to kill us,
'cause we're not leaving
until we get what we need.
Okay.
Fill her up.
Give them what they want.
- Come and get 'em!
- I'm so excited.
- Come and get 'em!
- Access enough for you?
Come and get 'em!
That'll do.
Gotta defend yourself. Got to.
'Cause if this keeps up, people start
running out of food, water, gas,
they're gonna start shooting at each other.
No, thank you.
I've had enough of this kind of thing.
This is more like it.
I'd rather have this, if you don't mind.
It seems...
friendlier, somehow.
Hey.
I think you're a lot like me.
Good luck.
Good luck to you, too.
- We here.
- What is that?
- Anyone listening?
- Where is it coming from?
I found her on
a message board on YouTube.
Someone listen.
We Tokyo.
Very bad here.
Very bad Tokyo.
- Tokyo. Can you believe it?
- Aah!
There's hundreds of posts
like this all over the world.
He's got the technology.
No, no, no.
- No.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Don't bury dead.
- Okay, it's back.
First shoot in head.
- Don't bury dead. First shoot in head.
- Something's gone wrong.
- Wait.
- Damn it.
Well, plug it in.
I just charged it.
Then it's not the phone, it's the service.
The fucking service is going out.
Nothing?
How can there be nothing?
It's the towers.
The relay towers must be out.
Jesus. All of them?
Technology is terrific, Eliot,
except when it doesn't work.
Great.
It won't be long
before nothing works, darling.
Nothing at all.
<i>The mainstream had vanished</i>
<i>with all its power and money.</i>
<i>Now it was just us,</i>
<i>bloggers, hackers, kids.</i>
When there were three networks, three lied.
You've got to trust somebody.
Now that there are 400,000 people,
you have 400,000 lies.
<i>The more voices there are,</i>
<i>the more spin there is.</i>
<i>The truth becomes
that much harder to find.</i>
<i>In the end it's all just noise.</i>
...government is more capable
of dealing with this crisis.
We're in Scranton.
This is Deb's house.
I thought they'd be here by now.
They were out, what, camping, right?
Any idea where?
They used to go
to some place in Virginia.
West Virginia.
You probably just beat them here.
Maybe they hit traffic or something.
We didn't hit any traffic.
There is no traffic.
And West Virginia
is only 100 miles away.
If that's where they went.
Yeah.
I'm gonna wait inside.
You guys should get back on the road.
What? And just leave you here?
This is where I grew up.
It's where I want to be.
You guys all have homes, too.
You should get going.
Get out of here.
Thanks for bringing me here.
Thanks for everything.
I guess I'll try to call you.
I'll try to come back for you.
Bye, Jay.
Don't be an asshole.
Can't just let her wait here alone.
Hey.
Mind if, uh,
maybe I hang out for a while, too?
Yeah, okay.
Uh, me, too?
I need to pee again.
Well, I can't sit in here anymore.
I want to meet your little brother.
Maybe he has a PlayStation.
I'd like to meet your father.
Maybe he has a bar.
They always hide a key.
Shit. Fuck.
I don't remember if it's 102 or 201.
It's probably wired on a single circuit.
- Where's the breaker box?
- In the garage.
I don't get it.
They're here?
Mom?
Dad!
Billy!
Maybe they dropped off their stuff
and went to the neighbor's or something.
Maybe there was an evacuation...
like, a mandatory evacuation.
No, they would have taken their car.
No, no, there's buses, right?
When they evacuate places,
they bring in, like, buses and...
- Mom?
... shit.
Dad!
Billy?
Oh, fuck.
Deb?
What is it?
Okay, they must have, like,
had an accident or something, right?
Maybe. Maybe they're at the hospital.
I just hope it's not a
hospital like we went to.
Okay.
Okay, my dad would have been driving,
and that means my mom
would have been in the passenger seat,
so that's my mom's blood...
there.
And, um...
And Billy would have been in the back,
so that means Billy is probably okay.
- Debra.
- No, I'm sure of it. Billy must be okay.
- Deb!
- What?
- Okay, listen to me.
- What...
You gotta know
that this might be...
this might be bad.
I know. No, I do. I know, okay?
Okay. Really.
- Now, let's go inside. Come on.
- Okay.
But don't think about your parents.
Don't think about your little brother.
We're gonna go in there,
and we're gonna try
and find something, okay?
Something like an old doll.
Yeah, okay.
An old... An old doll.
Okay. What is her name?
It's not a her, it's a him.
It's a him.
Okay, you got a guy doll.
Yeah, like Ken, you know?
Like Ken and Barbie?
Okay, like Ken, but not Ken.
What's his name?
What is his name?
Michael.
Like the archangel.
Okay.
So we're gonna go in there,
and we're gonna go look for Michael.
Okay.
Okay.
<i>I thought long and hard</i>
<i>about whether to leave
this footage in the film.</i>
<i>I decided in the end...</i>
<i>to show you exactly what happened.</i>
Aah!
Let me through! Deb!
Aah!
No!
No!
Daddy?
Mommy?
Mommy.
I think it's time we left this place.
<i>By now we'd become part of it.</i>
<i>Part of 24/7.</i>
<i>It's strange how, looking at things,</i>
<i>seeing things through a lens, a glass,</i>
<i>rose-colored or shaded black,</i>
<i>you become immune.</i>
<i>You're supposed to be affected,
but you're not.</i>
<i>I used to think
it was just you out there,</i>
<i>the viewers,</i>
<i>but it's not.</i>
<i>It's us as well,</i>
<i>the shooters.</i>
<i>We become immune, too...
inoculated</i>
<i>so that whatever happens around us,</i>
<i>no matter how horrible it is,</i>
<i>we just wind up taking it all in stride.</i>
<i>Just another day.</i>
<i>Just another death.</i>
It's gonna be okay, babe.
It's gonna be okay.
Hey, do you want to switch places?
I could take the camera
for a while, then you could...
Leave him alone, Trace.
He's right where he wants to be.
Hey, where'd you learn
how to use that thing?
Eaton.
Archery squad.
Targets, of course.
Nothing at all to do with...
life and death.
I used to have a steady hand.
You still do.
Thank you.
Where's your home, Professor?
Or where was it?
Portsmouth.
That's where it was.
Such as it was.
Not really a home.
Just a place.
I've never seen or imagined
a home
that I could wish or want for my own.
Sad.
Not at all.
Mine is a...
a wandering spirit.
Yeah, he wanders to wherever
there's a bottle of spirits.
Alas.
Where are we going, Eliot?
I'd like to get to my place.
We talked to Ridley.
When?
At the warehouse online.
He's okay?
Yeah, him and Franny sounded great.
He invited us to come.
Philadelphia?
Could make it there before dawn.
Hey, hey, hey. Look at this.
It's the Guard.
It's the fucking Guard!
Call me crazy,
but those guys don't look dead.
You see?
I told you they'd show up.
Hi, there.
Is it nice to see you guys.
Good.
What's with the camera?
Just making a movie.
Oh, is that so?
Where'd you get all the stuff?
Friends.
You know, seems to be
a whole lot of folks
getting a whole lot of stuff
from a whole lot of friends.
Can we be friends?
Want to turn that off, son?
Turn it the fuck off.
Now.
There's your fucking
National Guard, Tony.
They stole everything we got.
Not everything.
They left us our weapons.
Sure, but they have their own.
They're military men.
With the world being what it is,
they knew we wouldn't
survive without weapons.
They're not murderers,
just thieves.
"The world being what it is. "
Think about that.
From now on,
everyone who dies...
is gonna come back.
I mean, think about that.
Everyone who dies,
unless they get a bullet in the head,
is gonna come back
and try to kill somebody else.
And on and on and on.
Forever.
Turn your helmet cams on.
See anyone alive, pull them out.
Hey! Anyone in there?
Anybody home?
- Wait. Hold it.
- Don't go in there!
Do not open this door!
Hold it! Hold it!
Hey, are you all right, mister?
- Don't!
- Are you all right?
You can't go in there!
What are you hiding in there, old man?
No! No, please!
There's nobody in here.
I don't see anything.
Aah!
Son of a bitch!
Over there! Behind you!
You fucking dick!
No! No!
Hiding these fucking dead
pieces of meat in here?
- Look what happens! Look what happens!
- Please don't!
- No!
- They were family.
- Kill him.
- They were family!
- Kill the prick!
- No, don't shoot.
Don't shoot him in the head.
Shoot him in the heart.
Let him fucking wake up dead.
It used to be us against us.
Now it's us against them.
<i>He was right.</i>
<i>Us against them.</i>
<i>Except they...</i>
<i>are us.</i>
I know it's around here someplace.
Right here. Here.
Here it is.
Wake up, guys.
Guys, come on! Wake up!
Oh, man. It's huge.
It's like what God might have built
if only he had the money.
Ridley made this place
sound like a fortress.
Um, I've never been to a fortress before,
but don't they usually
keep the doors locked?
I told you. He said everything was cool.
Well, that was yesterday.
Plenty of security.
There's gotta be monitors
around here somewhere.
Monitors don't do us any good
unless somebody's watching.
Someone might be
watching us right now.
Okay. Let's go in.
Wait, wait. Go back. Step back.
I want to cover everything.
Okay. Ready. Come in!
I can't do this anymore.
Every time we walk in somewhere,
somebody dies.
Or somebody's already dead.
It's gonna be the same everywhere we go.
Shut the door.
Ridley?
Ridley!
Francine?
Hello!
Ridley?
Well, this is where the party was.
Good Lord.
Treasures. Absolute treasures.
<i>A Tale of Two Cities.</i>
First edition.
Do you have any idea what this is worth?
It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times.
- Well.
- Ridley!
You scared us half to death!
You came. Oh, this is great.
This is just so fucking great
to have all you guys here.
How you doing, bro?
- Where's Francine?
- Where are your parents?
- Out back.
- Why was the front door open?
Oh, was it?
I was outside.
Just came back in.
Must not have shut it behind me.
Stupid.
Just stupid. You know me.
I'm stupid.
What's in there?
- The panic room.
- Wow.
What's going on?
Why were you in there?
Just checking the generator, that's all.
Everything's fine.
Even better now that you're here.
God!
It is just so great
to have you guys here!
You must be totally burned.
What can I get for you?
Something to eat? Drink?
A cocktail would be lovely.
Well, the bar is right over there.
I'd like to get this damned corset off.
Can you help me?
You know what I'd like?
A long, hot bath.
Pick a bathroom. We've got six.
Clean towels, soap, shampoo.
Whatever you need. Whatever.
So nobody's tried
to break in or anything?
Nobody around to break in.
We're pretty isolated out here.
Country club's closer
than the next house,
but not too many interested
in golf or tennis these days.
Where's your stuff?
You must have brought
some stuff with you.
Dirty clothes. Bags of them.
Well, bring it in. Bring it all in.
Something tells me you're
gonna be here for a while.
I'll go to the Winnie.
I'll come with you.
I'd like to grab that other camera.
Yeah, 'cause one's never enough.
Here, you take this one.
No, no. I don't want
to make this kind of movie.
I don't want to make
this kind of movie, either,
but I can't change the script.
Here. See if you can resist.
I don't want to do this.
Jason.
Jason, I don't want to do this.
My father shot a rabbit!
I thought it was in here.
Oh!
Hmm. Tony.
You're filming.
I guess Jason was right.
You can't resist.
I'm filming you, Ridley,
'cause you're acting a little weird.
All this shit that's been going on.
I know.
I know what's going on.
Still a little bit tired and...
and a little drunk.
That's all.
Forget the rabbit.
- Ridley?
- How about some pheasant?
Father shot two of those.
They're downstairs
in one of the big freezers.
Ridley, can we go see Francine now?
She's out back...
with my family and the staff.
Yeah, you said that.
Why don't we go see her?
I don't think we should do that.
- Why?
- Well...
to begin with...
Father's dead.
He was the first one to die.
Then he did Mother,
and then they both did the staff.
Brannigan, Brenda, Cook.
Really liked Cook.
Maybe she ate the rabbit.
Did somebody eat Francine?
Did somebody eat Francine?
No.
Well...
No, not exactly.
I mean, Brannigan bit her on her face.
I think. I don't know.
It all happened so fast.
I think we should get out of here.
Wait. Ridley?
You're saying they're all dead.
Yes.
I had to bury them.
Is no one else hungry?
I didn't bury them in the garden.
I'd never dig up Mother's roses.
It's okay. Come on.
I had to chop off Cook's hand.
That's why there's so much blood.
Shit.
Come on.
Maybe we should get out of here.
No, I gotta see this.
Guys.
It's a little hard to see.
Here, I'll turn on the lights.
This is where I buried them.
Sweet Jesus.
- He's gone.
- There was blood on his arm.
I wonder if he got bitten.
Guys?
Darlings?
Jason, a little help here?
I'm shooting.
Oh, Ridley.
Can you give me a hand?
Aah!
Jesus, he's dead.
He's fucking dead.
Oh, fuck.
Jason!
A little help here?
Hey! Run!
Run, Tracy!
See? I told you
dead things move slow!
Where the fuck did they go?
Tracy?
Oh, shit.
I don't believe this.
I don't fucking believe this!
Just like your goddamn mummy movie!
Jason, put down that
stupid camera and help me.
Aah!
Aah!
You getting this, Jason?
I hope you're happy, you son of a bitch!
Hey! Hey!
This isn't a movie, Jason. It's real!
I'm trying to distract him.
Cut! Cut!
Cut!
Don't mess with Texas.
Tracy!
Tracy!
I'm leaving you, Jason.
You can keep the house.
I'll take the car.
Shit.
I don't believe this.
What is she, nuts?
Where does she think she's going?
She's not going for Chinese.
You know what? It's okay.
We... We still got Ridley's car.
There's other cars in the garage.
- We could still get out of here.
- No, bad idea.
Look, Ridley is still moping around
somewhere, dead or alive.
And there are human goldfish
in the fucking pool.
We just spent the last
two days on the road.
- Did you have a good time?
- No, but...
Out there, we're lunch.
In here,
there is a steel-reinforced panic room
where could sit and play Nintendo
until this whole thing blows over.
Shit!
Don't, Deb! It's me.
Jesus.
Jesus.
Where's Ridley?
Have you seen him?
Yeah, he's not Ridley anymore.
He's something else.
Eliot is something else, too, I'm afraid.
What?
Or gone.
Died in a tub of water
with Ridley in his arms.
- How do you know all this?
- I saw it on TV, darling.
I took my bourbon, and I went in
to watch the monitors.
I went into the panic room,
which I suggest is a good place
for us all to go right now.
Always fancied myself a swashbuckler.
You're drunk, Professor.
Indeed I am.
But drunkenness has, oddly,
regretfully,
never twisted my perceptions
of things going on around me.
Tracy's phone. Let's go.
- No.
- Jason.
We can't just lock ourselves
in a fucking room.
We'd be locking ourselves
out of the world.
That's the whole point.
We lock ourselves out of the world
before the world bites us on the ass.
We've got weapons.
We can take care of whatever comes.
I can't go in there, Deb.
I'll miss... I'll miss everything.
God damn it, Jason!
Would you stop this?
Come with us.
Be safe.
Settle, like I'm trying to do.
Settle for...
- For what?
- For life.
For survival.
Survival? Who the fuck wants to survive
in a world like this?
All that's left
is to record what's happening
for whoever remains when it's over.
Please.
I don't want to go in there without you.
All right.
We can't.
What was that?
Where the hell is he?
Oh, no.
Oh, God.
You fuck.
Shoot me.
Michael...
the Archangel.
Hi, my name is Jay... Jason Creed,
and I have been given
the opportunity...
given the gift
to be able the document the events
that have suddenly landed in my lap.
And I just want to let you guys know...
the audience know...
that I'm gonna do my best
to capture the truth
with me and my friends.
There's gonna be no fakeness.
I'm gonna go after everything.
Really raw, really real.
And I'm going to do the best job I can.
And I'm just really excited
to be given this opportunity.
And I am not going to fuck it up.
Yeah.
Debbie?
Debra!
Debra!
Debra?
Deb?
I'm gonna finish his movie.
The movie's over.
No.
There's gonna be more.
There's gotta be more.
Morning approaches.
Things always look better
in the morning.
Not to me.
Mornings bring light.
I prefer the darkness.
It's easier to hide in the dark.
You know what, Professor?
I actually get the... the mornings.
They show you for what you are,
instead of what you think you are.
Inelegantly phrased, Mr. Ravello,
but accurately put.
Mornings... and mirrors.
I despise them.
Mornings and mirrors
only serve to terrify old men.
Hey, could you say that again?
I didn't get that.
<i>Et tu, darling?</i>
Look at this.
Close the door.
<i>Jason once said he thought he could help,</i>
<i>maybe even save some lives.</i>
<i>This is the last thing
he downloaded before he died:</i>
<i>A couple of hometown Joes
who went out to shoot at targets.</i>
<i>But that day, they used people.</i>
<i>Dead people.</i>
<i>You know, just for fun?</i>
<i>There was one target
that was different from the rest.</i>
<i>A woman...</i>
<i>tied by her hair to the branch of a tree.</i>
<i>The boys had this one
set up just for kicks.</i>
<i>They got out their
favorite 12 gauge and...</i>
<i>Are we worth saving?</i>
<i>You tell me.</i>
