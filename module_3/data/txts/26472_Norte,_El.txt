Arturo, do we meet tonight?
Tonight at the old hacienda.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
Rosa!
Get away from that house!
Yes, Mama. I'm coming.
- Don't bother those old sisters.
- Just leave them alone.
The door was open.
I thought I might see them.
You only see them
when you don't expect it.
Now help me. Your father
and brother will be home soon.
You see, you're a smart man.
You know that Arturo Xuncax
isn't your friend.
None of them are your friends.
They don't respect old customs.
They'll just ruin you.
It's horrible.
Think of your family.
Now let's stop wasting time.
Tell me where they're meeting.
At the old hacienda... tonight.
It's Don Goyo. I love his music.
Come, sit down.
Are Pedro and Josefita coming?
Yes, they'll be here soon.
Arturo...
are you really going out tonight?
Yes, probably.
That's it... the old hacienda.
We'll go on foot from here.
Then we'll spread out.
In the U.S., even the poorest
people have toilets...
just like Don Rodrigo's!
You flush it
and everything vanishes instantly!
You can really pee in style there!
It's always "the north" with you!
Can't you talk about anything else?
I love hearing about the north.
- Good.
- We hear about it enough!
- But it's true.
- There's a lot of money there.
I've heard from my friends...
all the people that have left.
And you can see on TV
how it is up there.
That's right.
Even the poor people
have their own cars.
So, how do you know so much
about the north?
For ten years, Don Rodrigo's cook
has been giving me...
all of her old Good Housekeeping
magazines.
Ah.
Ten years I've been reading them.
I know plenty.
Excuse me.
Go ahead.
Sweethearts?
Really? How romantic!
How are you, Rosita?
I'm fine, Luis.
I brought you this cinnamon candy.
Oh, thank you. I love it.
Well, excuse me,
but I'm going out for a while.
Stay and enjoy yourselves.
Stay here, please.
It's so late.
I have to go.
Lupe.
Don't worry.
He can take care of himself.
Comadre.
Come on. Sit down with us.
- Good night, Rosita.
- Good night.
Papá.
Mama is afraid.
Do you have to go out tonight?
Your mother knows
how things are here.
She doesn't want trouble.
And that's fine, but...
we can't go on
this way anymore.
I'm afraid as well.
So am I.
But sometimes you have to
fight for your land.
There is no choice.
The rich came here.
They're not from here.
They came looking for good land.
No one fights over bad land.
That's why they took our land.
Because this is good land!
I'll tell you something, Enrique...
that my life has taught me.
I've worked in Mexico.
I've worked
on plantations at the coast.
I've worked in many places...
and everywhere it's the same.
For the rich,
the peasant is just a pair of arms.
That's all.
We are just arms to do their work.
They treat their animals
better than us.
For many years we've been trying
to make the rich understand...
that the poor have hearts and souls.
That we feel.
That we are people, and we're all equal.
Papá.
Let me go with you.
No, Enrique.
The time will come soon...
but not yet.
Go home.
Tell your mother not to worry.
I'll be home soon.
But where can we get guns?
We can run them through Chiapas,
just like other contraband.
The guerrillas
on the coast will help us.
- Yes, he's right!
- No, wait...
Protect him, Virgin Mother.
Arturo's right.
It's impossible to be neutral anymore.
Run!
Let's go.
That Indian bastard killed the Puma.
<i>It is not true</i>
<i>That we come here to live</i>
<i>We come only to sleep, to dream</i>
<i>All things are lent to us</i>
<i>We are only on Earth in passing</i>
<i>Tomorrow or the next day</i>
<i>As you desire, giver of life</i>
<i>We shall go home to you</i>
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
Okay. Take this shit away.
My mother. Where's my mother?
- We'll take care of you. You'll stay here with us.
- We'll protect you.
Forget about your mother.
The army's taken her away.
- No! My mother, no!
- It's not true!
- And Enrique!
- We don't know anything about him.
The soldiers are coming!
They're coming!
Quick! We've got to hide her!
They're leaving! Papa!
They're leaving!
Mama! Papa! The soldiers are leaving!
Rosa.
I thought they had taken you.
I was hiding in the canyon.
They didn't see me.
I was so afraid.
I kept hearing the guns.
Mother...
Mother...
They took her.
Yes, I know.
The soldiers will be back, Enrique.
I'm afraid.
People are leaving the village.
I have to leave too.
As long as I'm here,
I put all of you in danger.
You're going?
But where?
To the north.
El norte.
But I need money.
Ask our godmother.
See if she can help me.
Meet me tomorrow night
in our house.
Be careful.
Don Ramón!
Don Ramón!
So you're still alive.
I'm amazed.
I hid in the canyon.
Okay, let's talk.
You know a lot about what goes on.
I need help.
Right now your life
isn't worth five cents.
They'll be back for you.
Today, tomorrow...
the next day.
They'll hunt you down and find you.
You can't escape.
It's a fantasy.
Yes, I can.
I'm going to go north.
That's why I came here.
You've been there before.
You can help me!
It's a long journey.
You need money, and a lot more luck
than you've had up to now.
You need big balls...
and the protection of God
and all the saints.
But I guess you have to go.
Because if you stay here...
the only way you can hide from
the army is by turning into a flea.
GOOD HOUSEKEEPING
Rosita, what can we do?
Enrique's life is in danger here.
Enrique is leaving.
He's going north.
And I'm going with him.
To the north?
Is everything arranged?
We don't have money, Godmother.
Help us, please.
Of course I'll help you.
Wait.
Rosita...
I've always wanted to go north...
ever since I was a little girl.
But I'll never go.
I'm too old now.
Entonces.
These are my savings.
Now go to the north for me.
Remember.
You have to pretend to be Mexican.
Otherwise, if you're caught,
they'll send you right back here...
and that's your death.
It's hard to pretend to be Mexican.
Use your head
before they cut it off.
Okay, say something like a Mexican.
Tell me it's a hot day.
It's a... No.
It's a hot day.
Oh, God!
You won't get a mile past the border!
Say it's a "fucking" hot day.
Mexicans are always saying "fuck."
"Fuck" here, "fuck" there.
If you don't say "fuck"
all the time...
they'll know you're not Mexican!
And if they ask where you're from...
say Oaxaca, Mexico.
Most people can't tell the difference.
They think all Indians look alike.
Do you know a good coyote?
Yes. A good one.
Without him,
you won't get across.
And remember...
that the border between
Mexico and the United States...
is like a war zone.
Remember.
Rosa.
What are you doing?
I'm going with you.
With things the way they are now?
And you're a woman.
And you're a man.
They kill them both the same here.
But it's so dangerous.
Ramón says it's like a war.
I probably won't make it.
And with you...
My sister's crazy. Everyone is crazy.
There's no other way, Enrique.
When the soldiers come back,
they'll take me.
I'm afraid.
I'm so afraid.
But the money?
We don't have enough.
And your sweetheart?
The past is gone forever, Enrique.
I've lost my father... and my mother.
And when I thought you were gone...
I never felt so alone.
I won't let you leave me.
We have to stay together,
whether we live or die.
You're my whole family now.
Yes. You're right, Rosita.
We have to stay together.
But we're not going to die.
We're going to live!
And in the north,
we won't be treated this way.
We'll make a lot of money.
We'll have everything we want.
And we'll return one day.
We'll have good luck now.
I'm sure of it!
Wait.
There's something I must do.
- What?
- I must do it alone.
- Wait for me at the edge of town.
- All right. But hurry.
I will.
For my father.
For my mother.
And for my village.
Rosa.
Rosa.
Where are you going, Rosa?
Rosa, where are you going?
Rosa, are you all right?
Rosa. Rosa.
Rosa.
What's the matter? Are you all right?
No, no. I'm fine. Let's hurry.
Let's go... to the north.
Motherfucking tire!
Goddamn tire!
Fucking son of a bitch!
Piece of shit.
What the hell?
What the fuck are you doing there?
Cat got your tongue?
Little tramps.
Where are you going?
What direction?
Same way you're going.
Same way? Where are you from?
- Oaxaca, Mexico.
- Oaxaca?
So you're from Oaxaca, eh?
You're really fucked-up.
You're coming from
where we're going to!
Idiots!
Oaxaca is 300 kilometers ahead!
Guatemalans, aren't you?
Got you!
Just help me fix this damn tire...
and then I'll give you
a mother of a ride.
How did you get across the border?
They've got fuckloads of soldiers there,
so when you try to cross...
Yes, but Enrique knows
the mountain paths.
Bueno.
Done some smuggling, huh?
You like Mexican music?
Yes, I like it.
It's the best!
Hey, motherfucker!
Move your ass!
That's why God gave you one!
I can't stand drafts!
Can't you understand?
Goddamn Indians!
You should die for this!
Old fart.
Enrique Xuncax.
Enrique Xuncax.
You can't escape me this time,
you bastard!
We're here... Tijuana.
The shit-hole of the world.
Come on. I'm a good coyote.
Hey, only $300 to the north!
I'm the one! Come on.
I'm bold. I'll take you there
on the wings of destiny!
Don't be left behind!
Come on, miss.
I'll take you to the north.
Come here! Don't miss out!
Let's cross the border!
Don't be left behind!
I'll take you for $300 each!
It's the ultimate for the poor!
Let's go, "little chicks"... north!
You won't have to sleep on the floor.
Not like here,
where you're dying of hunger.
It's the land of money...
where you'll find
beautiful houses, big cars.
It's the most beautiful thing in life!
Come with me, to the north!
What a pair of dummies.
Don't know their ass
from a hole in the ground.
Dumb as animals.
What's going on here?
Jaime, these donkeys just arrived.
They're looking for their coyote,
but they don't have his address.
They think they're in their little village,
the jerks!
What a couple of turkeys!
Yeah, too bad they're not smart
like all of you geniuses, huh?
If you're so brilliant, what are
you doing here in Tijuana, barefoot?
Come on! Get out of here!
Leave them alone!
Don't mind those idiots.
Just arrived?
- Where are you from?
- We're from Oaxaca.
I'm from Zacatecas.
- My name is Jaime.
- I'm Enrique.
- This is my sister, Rosa.
- It's a pleasure.
Who are you looking for?
Raimundo Gutierrez.
A friend of someone in our village.
- Do you have his address?
- Yes...
We had it.
But he doesn't live here anymore.
I see.
Do you have any money?
Well, yes.
A lot?
Yes... I think so.
Let me give you some advice.
Don't give it to anybody.
You'll need it when you
get to the north, understand?
And about finding your friend...
I'd help you, but...
I'm crossing tonight.
Maybe you want to stay
and look for your friend.
But if you want to cross,
you can try your luck with me.
Yes, we'd like to!
It's not that hard, believe me.
Do you want a place
to stay until we leave?
If we're going tonight, yes.
- Here, stay in here.
- No.
What if the owner comes back?
Rosa, look around you.
This is a "lost city"...
people come and go.
No one knows or cares
how many people are here.
And no one owns anything here.
At dusk, I'll come for you,
and we'll cross.
- All right?
- All right.
- See you later.
- Until tonight.
I told you we'd be lucky!
Imagine, meeting someone like him
on our first day here.
You're easily impressed.
Oh. And you can't appreciate good luck,
even if it comes up and bites you.
It's so hot and dusty.
It's not like San Pedro.
What are you saying?
Are you homesick?
Would you rather be in San Pedro?
I just said it was hot,
that's all.
I'm not homesick.
I don't want to be in San Pedro.
I'm not thinking about that.
If you think about things like that,
you'll go crazy.
Okay, forget it.
We won't talk about it anymore.
Go to sleep,
because tonight you won't be able to.
- Rosa.
- Mmm.
Do you suppose all these people...
are trying to go north like us?
Yes, I think they are.
That's a lot of people.
Go to sleep.
If you worry about that...
you'll go crazy even faster
than if you think about San Pedro.
You're so practical, Rosa.
- Go to sleep.
- Oh!
This is the hole.
Careful. Be as quiet as cats.
- 101 to 303.
- Go ahead.
I'll be right back. Wait here.
He's just peeing.
Robbing you is a pain in the ass!
You're a mean motherfucker!
How much dough
do you have anyway?
Dough?
Money, idiot!
Can't you speak Spanish?
Ah?
- Twenty dollars.
- What?
I'll be fucked!
You said you had a lot!
- That is a lot.
- Go to hell!
Now I've had my balls busted
for a lousy 20 bucks!
Motherfucker.
Don't move!
Looks like we got
us a couple of wets there, man.
Oh, look at that. They're just kids.
Oaxaca, Mexico.
Yes, Oaxaca also.
I think these
kids might not be from Mexico.
I think they might be
from Central America.
How do we find out, genius?
I've got a system.
First we ask them if they can
read and write.
Yeah.
Then we'll ask them to sing
the Mexican national anthem.
Yeah?
Well, if they can't sing
it, then we know they
didn't learn to read or
write in Mexican schools.
Do you know how to read and write?
Why does he want to know that?
I don't know...
but I think it's a trick.
We'd better lie.
- What are they saying?
- I don't know.
They're not speaking Spanish. They must be
speaking some kind of Indian language.
- Well, what the fuck good are you?
- No.
We can't read or write.
- They don't know how to read and write.
- Well, that's some great system you got there.
Okay.
Show me exactly where you are from.
What the fuck?
What's this fucking thing
you're showing me?
What the fuck
are you talking about?
- I don't know. He sounds like a Mexican to me.
- Oh, hell. I can't pin 'em down.
Send 'em back to Tijuana.
Who cares?
Oh, hey, man.
You gotta learn to lose.
Grow up.
Come and get your sweet rolls!
Hot tamales!
How many do you want?
Hey! Thief! Goddamn thief!
Police!
Lazy bastards! What are you laughing at?
I'm looking for Raimundo Gutierrez.
Raimundo.
I'm Raimundo.
- I want to go north.
- You're wasting your time, kid.
I stopped being a coyote a while ago.
It's too dangerous.
I don't take anyone across.
No one!
Wait. I'm a friend of Ramón Muñoz.
He gave me your name.
Seems like you haven't
eaten in a week.
But you're lucky. You're alive.
Can you help us?
Ramón is a good friend of mine.
I owe him some favors.
I guess I'll have to help you.
I suppose you don't have
much money.
I won't charge you much.
I'm doing it for Ramón.
But you have to give me something.
- There's a lot of expenses.
- How much?
About $100.
There's gas, food, hotel.
Don't worry.
We'll get the money.
Your sister. Is she strong?
I think she's stronger
than both of us together.
Good.
Because I'm not going to
take you through the mountains.
Too risky.
There's one other way.
The tunnels.
And it's horrible.
The old sewer tunnels that
connect Tijuana with the other side.
They haven't been used for years...
so they're empty.
The safest ones are the smallest.
But you have to crawl
on your hands and knees for miles.
It's safer than the mountains...
but it's really hell.
You can't hear anything.
You can't see.
And the stink...
It's safer.
But most people would rather
go through the mountains...
and risk getting robbed or shot!
Rosa.
Look what I have for you.
Some fruit and a sweet roll.
I brought something for you too.
- A steak!
- Enrique.
Where did you get that?
I had a big lunch...
with Raimundo Gutierrez!
- You found him!
- Yes!
And he's going to take us north!
There's just one thing.
We have to get $100.
This is pure silver.
This will get us the money.
Mother's necklaces?
No.
No, we can't sell them.
Enrique.
If we want to go north...
there's no other way.
It will seem like you'll never get out.
But I want you to keep going.
And when you get to the other end,
I'll be there waiting.
I promise.
May the Virgin take care of you.
What's that?
I think it's a dead cat.
Come on.
Rosa, are you all right?
Yes, Enrique.
Let's go.
We have to keep going.
I can see the end!
It's me.
- Raimundo.
- Of course.
I said I'd be here,
and here I am.
Just like I promised.
I brought you some sandwiches.
You've got a first-class coyote!
Rosita, come here!
That's San Diego.
Pretty, isn't it?
From here, it's easy.
Tomorrow we'll be in Los Angeles.
How about these two, eh?
- They married?
- No. They're brother and sister.
Son de Guatemala.
Guatemala? Big deal!
I get 'em from Guatemala,
Salvador, Nicaragua.
They coming in
from all South America.
Us Mexicans are beginning to be
a regular minority around here.
Give you 75 bucks for the girl,
nothing for the guy.
- Hey, Monty, wait a minute. What the hell's going on here?
- No lie, 'mano.
Things have changed since your last time here.
I got men coming out of my ears.
Every morning they line up
for day labor, huh?
Now, don't get me wrong.
He can stay and take his chances
with the rest of the men...
as long as he pays his rent.
But I can't pay you for the guy.
Monty, I brought them across
as a favor to an old friend.
I didn't charge them a dime.
So you got a good heart, huh?
You sleep good tonight.
That's your reward.
Seventy-five bucks for the girl,
or take 'em back.
Good.
Raimundo.
You and me,
we're public servants, huh?
The whole goddamn economy
would collapse like that...
if it wasn't for the cheap labor
we bring in, huh?
I suppose so, man.
- I suppose so.
- Good.
Nice, huh?
Stove.
Good refrigerator.
Huh?
Mira, I know.
Very simple...
but very comfortable
and very safe!
Muy seguro, huh?
- Rosa, I'll come for you in the morning.
- Okay?
- Yes.
- Good.
Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Yeah. Good night.
Josefita was right.
We have a flush toilet.
And we have electric light.
Now all we need to do is
to buy a new car without money.
Ay.
Josefita and her crazy stories.
- Come on, let's go.
- Let's go. Let's go, let's go.
She's a new girl. You teach.
Show iron.
- Iron.
- Ah, you want that I should show to her.
Ah, okay. Sí.
Same as you.
- Sí, don't worry about nothing.
- Sí, sí, sí. Okay, okay.
- All the same.
- Sí, sí. Okay, okay, Mr. Chung.
- What's your name?
- Rosa.
I'm Nacha.
Look, when you get a bundle to iron...
find the ticket that says "pressing."
Ah.
Tear it out and keep it.
Look.
They'll pay you 30 cents...
American money...
for each piece.
- Understand?
- Mm-hmm.
And be careful. This is steam.
- Hey, you. You.
- Are you looking for work?
- You!
- ¿ Yo?
Out of the 50 guys who are
standing around here, I want you.
- Just what I'm in the mood for...
- a game of charades.
You work? Work?
Work! Work!
Work. Work!
Yes! Yes. Sí. Work.
- Yes! Yes!
- All right! All right!
- We're making some progress.
- Sí. Sí.
Hey, wait a minute. How much?
How much?
Look.
One day. One day.
- Right?
- Yes! Yes!
Okay, kid, let's get going!
You look great. Just great.
Christian Dior couldn't
make you look better.
Carlos.
Look! Look!
What?
Look at those ladies.
They're like something in a magazine!
- These are too loose.
- This is no good.
- Yes, but these are good.
- No.
And I don't look like a model?
- No.
- Iron.
Because you look normal.
It has to be done over, done tighter.
We do good job always.
Immigration!
Run!
Shit.
Montezuma,
they are taking away everybody!
Jesus Christ.
Montezuma, I lose "everything's"!
Yeah? Well, who gives a goddamn
pinche fuck about your business?
What am I gonna do with
all the babies they left behind here?
Yeah.
Good! Good. Good.
What's this?
It's a croissant.
It doesn't fill you up like a tortilla,
but it's good. Eat it.
Where are you from?
- From Oaxaca.
- I'm from Chihuahua.
It's nice to have
another Mexican here.
He's Mexican too, isn't he?
Him? No, he's a "pocho."
The dummy can't even speak Spanish.
Hey, Carlos. Carlos.
ls it true you have testicles for eyes?
That's real funny, George.
Why don't you try your Spanish
on some of these dishes, huh?
Suck my sweet potato, asshole.
What's a "pocho"?
A Chicano.
What's a Chicano?
Well, he's an American citizen,
but he comes from a Mexican family.
That's why he has to do
the same shit work we do.
I always check out a place
before I take a job.
If I can't find a good escape route,
screw the job.
Sit down. My treat.
Hey, sweetie!
Give me two burritos with green chili
and two coffees.
Nacha.
Where are all the gringos?
Look at this street.
It's just like Mexico City.
Oh, Lord. You don't think gringos
want to live with Mexicans, do you?
They live out there
in their own neighborhoods.
Listen, I've been thinking.
I think I'll go back
to cleaning houses.
It's safer, and with my contacts...
Listen, maybe we'll be lucky
and get some big houses to clean.
What do you say?
You want to team up?
- Yes.
- Okay. It's a deal.
But you have to learn some English.
Yes, I want to learn English.
And I know where you can do it.
In the public schools it's free.
The government?
Isn't it dangerous?
No, it's the safest.
They never ask questions.
Why?
Ay, mi hija.
If you try to figure out gringos,
you'll just get a giant headache.
They're cuckoo.
You know, you look like an Indian.
That is... a little change
of clothes wouldn't hurt, eh?
- Have you ever heard of Sears?
- No.
Rosa, what happened to you?
Nothing.
Nothing!
What do you mean, nothing?
Everybody's talking about the "migra" raid!
I didn't know what happened to you,
if I would ever see you again.
I'm sorry. I escaped.
I met a smart woman.
I was lucky.
Rosa, no one escaped but you!
I've been crazy with worry.
And just look at you!
What's wrong with the way I look?
Nothing, but...
you look like a clown.
No, I look like an American.
And I'm going to work with Nacha,
cleaning houses!
What are you talking about?
Who's Nacha?
Enrique, we have to learn English.
- Rosa, don't change the subject.
- It's a good idea, don't you think?
I guess so.
But what circus did you escape from?
Oh!
My name is Florence.
How do you do?
My name is Enrique.
I am very glad to meet you.
Good.
Hi. I'm Florence.
Hello.
My name is Rosa.
I am very happy to meet you.
Good!
My name is Florence.
How do you do?
Fine. My name is Crispin, and I am...
I am very... I am very... I...
¡Ay, qué la chingada!
My name is Rosa.
I am very happy to meet you.
You speak English.
That's wonderful!
Just a little. I am learning.
How nice.
Well, I'll show you the house,
I'll tell you what I'd like you to do.
Let's start in the kitchen
and the laundry room. Okay?
- Okay.
- Come on.
Now, this is the washing machine,
and it's really very simple.
First you flip this to "on"...
and then you have eight
seconds to put your program
in or else it will go
to the default setting.
Now, I usually leave the water level
at extra-high reset...
because you can't move it
from one level to another
anyway without going
to the restart first.
And I generally leave "perm press" here
because that works for almost everything...
unless, of course, I'm using
an extra-heavy load of towels...
and then I use the "towels" setting.
That's really all there is to it.
I don't bother
with any of the other options.
Oh, except for Chris's T-shirts and socks,
and then I use the extra rinse.
Okay?
- Okay?
- Uh, okay, Mrs., uh, Rogers.
Um, don't worry about nothing.
Oh, good.
Nacha, would you please call me Helen?
- Okay, Helen.
- Good.
Now, this is the hold function.
If you press this, the machine goes off.
But it's not off really, you see, because
if it was you'd have to start over again.
And then you have the restart here.
So you can see how simple it is.
Now, the dryer is really easy.
Again, you press
the start lever here...
and then you have eight seconds.
Now, you can choose
any of these fabric types.
And if you want to adjust it, you either
press more or less or whatever down here.
Unless, of course,
you want a fixed drying time.
Then you set it
for however many minutes you want...
and when it shuts itself off
it will beep a few times to let you know.
Oh, unless you press
the wrinkle guard here.
Then it will beep a few times
and shut itself off.
And five minutes later
it will turn itself on again. Okay?
Okay, Mrs. Rogers.
You no worry about nothing.
We do good job.
I know you will.
- But please call me Helen.
- Okay.
Now, we'll go into the kitchen
and I will show you the trash compactor...
and the convection oven, okay?
Nacha...
do you understand how this works?
Sure.
Anyway, we'll figure it out.
The important thing is, whatever they say,
just smile and say yes.
Rosa, is it this smoggy all the time?
- Yes, it's this smoggy very often.
- Good.
Enrique, how is the weather
in Los Angeles?
It is usually very smoggy.
But, Rosa, Nacha...
I mean, doesn't she know how to use
the machine? What's going on here?
Can you operate the machine?
Yes, a little.
It's very complicated.
She says that she can
operate the machine... sort of.
Then why?
I don't understand why.
Rosita, why did you
wash the clothes like that?
I don't know.
No, I don't know.
She don't know.
- ¿Es qué...
- What?
What difference does it make
how I do it?
The clothes are clean, right?
She says, what difference
does it make how she does it...
as long as she does it?
But by hand? Oh, no. I mean it.
I just couldn't let her do all that
washing by hand. It's too much work.
I mean, I can't stand the thought
of her in here... scrubbing.
Rosita, it does matter how you do it.
You have to do it in the machine.
That's how it is done in the north.
You always use machines.
Okay.
- Could I have some more coffee, please?
- Yes, of course.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Which one should we have next?
"More coffee, please."
"Yes, of course."
"Thank you." "You are welcome."
- "More coffee, please." "Yes..."
- That's good, Ricky. That's good.
"Is it always this smoggy?"
"Yes, it usually is."
Oh, yeah!
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.
Let me guess.
You don't like it.
Well, Thanksgiving is a lovely holiday.
But gourds? Gourds are not haute.
Why don't you do something simple
with reeds and orchids?
Why don't you shit in your bed
and roll over in it?
Len, my ears
are not garbage cans.
Here, I finished the Thanksgiving menu.
Len, Freddie's quitting. He says he has to
study full time for the bar exam.
- The bar exam?
- I had a martini he mixed once. Let him study.
Len, we have to find someone.
I've been thinking, why don't we
promote Ricky, the Mexican service boy?
He's been doing great. He's earned a break.
He knows enough to move to assistant.
- How's his English?
- Pretty good.
Let's face it... you don't have to
be Shakespeare to help the waiter.
That's true.
You don't even have to be Neil Simon.
Especially here,
where the whole menu is in French.
Right. Hey, Ricky!
Ricky, come over here for a second.
Oysters, golden cav...
Eighty dollars, prix fixed.
Len, at this price you can afford
some orchids. Good luck.
Ricky, Ricky, I wanna move you up.
You're gonna be waiter's assistant.
Más dinero.
Rosa! Look at me!
What happened?
You look wonderful.
I've been promoted!
See?
I'm becoming somebody important!
- Would you like to see the menu?
- Oh, yes!
- More wine?
- Yes, please.
Okay.
I'm very proud of you, Enrique.
- Very proud.
- Rosa...
I want to tell you something
that Papa told me before...
before he was killed.
He told me that...
for the rich...
all peasants are just a pair of arms
to do their work.
But he wanted something more for me.
He wanted people to know...
that I'm a man
with a heart and a soul.
Look at me now!
People will see me
and respect me.
In this country you work hard...
but you can get somewhere.
I told you, Rosa...
things would change for us.
We've had hard times...
but look.
Nothing can stop us now.
Nothing.
Come in.
- Don Mocte!
- Enrique, can I see you for a minute?
Come on in.
Enrique, this is Alice Harper.
Alice, this is Enrique,
the man I was telling you about.
- Nice to meet you.
- I am very happy to meet you.
So, Enrique,
how's your English coming along?
It's okay. Like your Spanish.
Enrique, Alice has a factory in Chicago.
Now, most of the men she hires
usually do just regular factory work.
But now she's looking for a foreman.
- "Foreman"?
- Um, el jefe.
She's looking for someone smart.
Someone who knows Spanish and English
and gets along good with everybody.
So, what do you think?
I'm setting you up to be a foreman.
- Foreman?
- It's a good job.
Pays good money... 225 a week.
And she pays your way to Chicago.
- Chicago?
- Uh, Chi...
Big city, far away.
- Far?
- Very far away.
I don't know.
I have to talk to Rosa.
- And if...
- Oh, no. No family. No familia.
No, we can't allow any families.
It just gets too complicated.
So Rosa has to stay here. Okay?
It's a good job.
No.
I can't do it, Don Mocte.
It's nice of you, but...
I can't do it.
It's impossible.
I cannot leave Rosa alone.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It is very nice to meet you.
Thank you.
Thank you, Don Mocte.
Excuse me.
What'd I tell you, Alice?
He's perfect, but he won't do it.
That's just the way these people are.
He would be perfect. He's bright,
and he's very self-assured, isn't he?
Too much, if you ask me.
But don't worry.
I got a million of 'em.
Let me see it.
Let's go celebrate, okay?
I'd like to, but I have to go home.
- Why?
- I have to go see my sister.
Oh, fuck!
It's always your sister!
She's a woman. You're a man.
You can do what you want!
What do you say?
Let's celebrate.
- All right.
- Good. Let's go.
Are you feeling well, Rosa?
Hmm?
Yes.
I'm just a little tired.
Where is Enrique today?
I don't know.
He didn't come home today.
I think he have to work late.
Jovencia,
do you like living in a big city?
Here you are with your napkin.
"Oh, do you want some coffee,
please?". "Yes. Thank you very much."
You asshole.
- Who's there?
- Rosa!
Come in.
- What's the matter?
- I was better, but now I'm much worse.
You have the fever of hell.
It's very bad.
Ow!
- Enrique.
- ¡Hola, Don Mocte!
I spoke to that gabacha
from Chicago last night.
She's still interested in you.
For what reasons I don't know.
She says she can get you
a green card.
That's right.
You work for her one year or two,
and you can be legal.
- I can be legal?
- That's right!
I'll go call her right now.
Come on.
Still thinking about Rosa, huh?
Wake up, 'mano.
The train only comes by once,
and this is it for you.
Enrique, you can be legal.
This is the opportunity of your life.
Come on.
What's the big goddamn deal, eh?
You go to Chicago
and Rosa stays here.
She won't starve to death.
What's so goddamn important, huh?
You think you're the only one
that has to leave family behind?
It happens all the time.
I get babies left here...
when their mothers get picked up
by "la migra."
I have to take them
to the orphanages.
Who knows what happens to 'em, huh?
We are talking about survival.
You understand, kid?
Survival.
I know how to "survival," Don Mocte...
and I want to be legal...
but...
- But you won't take the job, eh?
- No.
I can't.
Okay.
I can't force you to take
the opportunity of your goddamn life.
Buy 'em a book,
send 'em to school, for what?
These people.
Good morning, Carlos.
Good morning, Ma.
Uh, is this the, uh,
Department of Immigration?
Mother?
Good morning. Hurry up now.
You have to go to work.
But, Mother...
It's so hard to
make tortillas on this stove.
If only I had my comal.
But what can we do?
Life here is so hard.
You have to buy food, pay rent...
It's all so expensive!
They told us that in the north
you could make a lot of money...
but they never told us
you had to spend so much.
Rosita!
It's your father.
Go see what he wants.
¡Papá!
Look, Rosita. I cut these for you.
¡Rosita! ¡Ay, Rosita!
What's the matter?
What happened?
- What happened?
- Mother.
Thank you.
Jorge! Immigration!
Holy shit! Run!
- No, no. They'll send me back!
- I can't go to the hospital.
They'll send me back,
and I'll be murdered! No!
They'll send me back!
Enrique!
Okay, I need a Social Security number.
- She don't have one.
- Okay.
I need some form of I.D...
a driver's license maybe?
How about a green card?
Uh, she don't have one.
Okay, I'll have to refer this to the doctor
and he'll decide whether or not to take it.
Have a seat over there and the doctor
will be with you just as soon as he can.
But, miss, she's very sick.
Please.
The doctor will be with you
just as soon as he can.
Vámonos. Come on.
You've got to get someone in there to help me.
They're getting ants in their Gucci pants.
Is it my fault
those two guys suddenly vanished?
It may not be your fault, dear,
but it's your problem.
Hey, Carlos! Bruce needs some help.
Get a vest.
- Vest?
- Yeah, a vest. On the double.
Get the lead out of your ass.
You've been promoted.
Okay. This is the one, right?
- Yes, this is the one.
- Hi.
Let me get in here.
- Nurse, did you take this woman's temperature?
- No.
Do you have a rash?
A rash. Does she have a rash?
Let me have a look.
It's okay. It's okay.
All right.
Nurse, get this woman to isolation, stat.
Let's go.
You come with me. Let's go.
At least we got away.
Let's drink to that.
Yeah, but we don't have any work.
We're really fucked.
We'll find something else.
It's not so easy.
Being out of work up here is the worst.
There are so many people now
and not so much work as there used to be.
It was that "pocho" who turned us in.
The "pocho"?
How do you know?
Easy.
The "migra" doesn't show up
just because their balls itch.
Someone has to call.
He's been pissed off
ever since you got promoted.
That's the way it is here.
You've got to look out for yourself,
or you're fucked.
You do whatever
you have to do to survive.
That's what the "pocho" did.
That's the way it is.
That's the way it is... reality.
None of this would happen
if only we had those damned papers!
Attention, please. Paging Dr. Cameron.
- Dr. Murphy.
- Yeah?
- Here's the lab report you wanted.
- Oh, thanks.
It's a false alarm.
She's not contagious.
It's not epidemic typhus.
It's murine typhus.
Murine typhus?
How do you get that?
From rats.
Oh, Jesus.
All right, thanks a lot.
¡Hola, Don Mocte!
Hi, kid.
Don Mocte,
I was thinking about what you said.
You know...
about that job in Chicago...
I think you are right.
I mean, I was wrong
and you are right.
I want to take the job for that lady.
I want to go to Chicago.
So you've come to your senses, eh?
Too late, though.
I think she has someone else in mind.
They don't want you anymore.
Don Mocte...
I... I got to have the work.
I need it.
I don't have more work.
You should have listened to me
when I was talking to you.
Now it's too late.
I told you, she's leaving.
Se va.
Uh, listen...
please... let me talk to her.
She liked me.
Just tell me where she is.
Give me a chance to talk to her.
Okay?
Doctor, how is she?
She's gonna be all right?
Is she gonna die?
She's got a good chance
of pulling through.
I'm not gonna give you
any false hopes.
It's pretty far along, and there's not
a lot we can do at this stage.
If you could find her brother for me
it would be a big help.
- Enrique?
- Yes.
Yes, Doctor, I find him for you.
I swear I will. I'll find him.
I find him.
The drummer was terrible.
The singer was terrible.
The band was terrible.
The soloists were terrible.
The sound was terrible.
Hey.
Do you remember me? I am Ricky.
Oh. Yes. I remember you.
But you didn't want the job.
I think about it. I want it.
- Did Monty send you here?
- No.
He said you hire someone else.
But I said I must talk to you.
I do a better job than anyone else.
You won't be sorry.
Yes?
You're a little more aggressive
than I thought.
You have some family, don't you?
Wasn't that the problem?
No, it's no problem.
My sister, she has a good job.
- She will be all right here.
- Yes, I'm sure she will be.
A-And I...
l go to Chicago, yes?
Well, I think you would do
a good job, Ricky.
You have a good attitude,
and I do need someone.
But it's already after 7:00 and we have
to leave tonight at a quarter to 12:00.
- I don't see how you can be ready.
- I can be ready!
I can go tonight.
It's cold in Chicago this time of year.
Do you have any warm clothes?
Yes. Yes, I can be ready.
All right. I'll make the arrangements
for the tickets. That's no problem.
- Do you have enough money to
take a cab to the airport? - Yes.
You should be there
no later than 10:45.
It's flight 138, gate 42.
Wait, let me
write that all down for you.
Don't lose this.
And don't be late.
I'll have the tickets at the gate.
I suppose if you can find your way to
Los Angeles from your village in Mexico...
you can find your way
to the right gate at the airport.
Dr. Reilly. Dr. Donald Reilly.
Dr. Hernandez.
Dr. David Hernandez.
Nacha?
- Thank God I found you.
- You've got to come with me immediately.
- What's going on?
- Rosa is in the hospital.
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.
She got sick this morning.
The doctor said I had to get you.
But I can't go right now.
Why?
I've got to leave.
I'm going to Chicago... tonight.
What are you saying?
Are you crazy?
Rosa is in the hospital!
You take care of her, Nacha.
She'll get better.
I know it.
I'll call when I arrive.
Nacha, I must go!
I don't have a job!
I don't have much time.
I must go now.
Nacha, take care of her, please.
I can't believe it.
The doctor told me to find you.
Rosa could die!
Listen to me! She could die!
Leave me alone! Leave me!
All right.
Rosa may be dying...
but you...
are already dead.
Last call for passengers...
on flight 89 to San Francisco...
now boarding at gate 16.
Last call for passengers...
on flight 89 to San Francisco...
now boarding at gate 16.
Enrique.
- Are you feeling better, Rosa?
- Yes.
In my dreams, I felt afraid.
I felt like that day in San Pedro...
when I thought
you would never come back.
But when I woke up...
you were here...
with me.
Of course.
You're the only family I have.
We have to stay together.
Life here is very hard, Enrique.
We're not free.
Isn't it true that we're not free?
Yes, life is difficult here.
It's true.
You have to work very hard.
In our own land...
we have no home.
They want to kill us.
There's no home for us there.
In Mexico there is only poverty.
We can't make a home there either.
And here in the north...
we aren't accepted.
When will we find a home, Enrique?
Maybe when we die
we'll find a home.
Don't say that, Rosita.
It's hard...
but we're going to have luck.
And we'll get everything we want.
And we'll make a lot of money.
And we'll return to our village.
And when we walk down the streets
people will look at us with envy.
Things are changing.
Yes, we'll have a lot of luck now.
I'm sure of it.
The only thing is to not lose faith.
That's it.
The important thing
is not to lose faith.
Rosita?
Rosa?
Rosa?
Rosa! Rosa, no!
Yo!
Okay, come on.
I need men with strong arms to work.
- Me! Take me!
- I'm strong! I can work!
Me! Take me!
I have strong arms!
