         In the year 411 BC--
         that's before
         baby Jesus, y'all--
         the Greek Aristophanes
         penned a play
         satirizing his day.
           And in the style
           of his time,
           'Stophanes made
           that shit rhyme.
          Transplanted today,
          we retain his verse
          to show our love
          for the universe.
          But warning!
    You gonna see some pain!
    But that's only natural,
       'cause it involves
           the gangs.
           So before
      I unfreeze these Gs,
         like the stats
       you heard before--
    people, people, people,
           we can't take
           too much more!

              Spit your lick.
    Come on, man.
    Spartans, yo.
- No.
                  No music?
                  No nothing?
Nothing but the beat
of the headboard bumping
when my third leg
go thumping.
               Slow down.
              You gotta bring me
              the romance.
        Then maybe, like Biggie,
                I give your ass
                one more chance.
Okay, okay.
Well, like 'Pac say,
        I can't wait
        to get you home,
      - get you all alone.
      - Mm-hmm.
Get you home in my bedroom.
Maybe we could bone
and get it on.
Got a lot of thug in me.
I wanna put it in you.
    Hey, goofy,
    why do I stay with you?
Because you know Chi-Raq
will make you stammer
       when I crack your back
       with this Spartan hammer.

Hey, Dolmedes!
      Welcome to Chi-Raq,
       the land of pain,
      misery, and strife.
     Folks, our Windy City
         been filleted
        with a king-size
         butcher knife.
         Like a monster
       from outer space,
        the great state
         of Drillanois
          has been hit
        by a murderous,
       big-ass killeroid.
     And that's real shit,
    where the big moneymaker
 is the black suit undertaker.
    But don't pity our pain.
   Might ain't always right,
        ain't you heard?
        And this coming
      from a natural man.
       Baby, you've come
          face-to-face
       with the super bad
         Mr. Dolmedes.
      My black ass was on
   the first box of Wheaties.
        I was raised up
   in a pail of rusted nails,
     ran buck naked through
     golf ball-sized hail,
   was weaned on Thunderbird
     from my mama's titty.
           Kicked ass
      from coast to coast
      till both shoe toes
          were shitty.
    Chewed up electric lines
and pissed out lightning bolts.
     Hit Godzilla so hard,
 it gave Mothra's daddy a jolt.
        Sank the Titanic
      with a frozen turd,
      then won 10 Grammys
     and didn't sing or rap
          one goddamn
      motherfucking word.
     Now, I told you about
     the Signifying Monkey
    and rapped about shine,
         but this here
       tale of two cities
       is one of a kind.
      It all started with
   a gorgeous Nubian sister.
         <i> Baby so fine,</i>
   <i> she made George Zimmerman</i>
       <i> and Darren Wilson</i>
        <i> wanna kiss her.</i>
       <i> As tough as Coffy</i>
    <i> and sexy as Foxy Brown.</i>
             <i> Hell,</i>
    <i> Beyoncé Knowles herself</i>
     <i> even had to bow down.</i>
   <i> They call her Lysistrata,</i>
     a woman like no other.
  This chocolate brown sister
         was finer than
        a motherfucker.
       She could put fear
         in a pit bull,
      made Bruce Lee flee,
  knocked out Frazier and Ali,
   <i> then ran Money Mayweather</i>
      <i> up a sycamore tree.</i>
          <i> With a mind</i>
         <i> like Einstein</i>
     -<i> and a truly... </i>
     - Yo, what's up, girl?
      <i> ...luscious behind,</i>
          that gal put
       gap-goody hurting
        on all mankind.
                Drive-by.
                Spartans and
                Trojans beefing.
        Little girl, Patti,
        wrong place, wrong time.
                 Messed up.
    Barbara,
    you see the shooter?
        Woman:
       <i> Behind the yellow tape.</i>
       <i> Know what I'm saying?</i>
       <i> Behind the yellow tape.</i>
 Man:
<i> Oh, boy.</i>
         Somebody called me
         to tell me--
        - Ma'am, please.
        - What happened?
       - What's going on?
       - Ma'am.
            My baby.
            That's my baby.
Ma'am, please.
            Is that my...
        - Is that--
          what happened?
        - Ma'am...
             You have to go
             down to the morgue
             for identification,
             ma'am.
        But that's my baby.
          Is that my--
       - Patti!
       - You can't cross
         the line, ma'am.
                         Please.
        Did y'all see something?
    You ain't seen nothing?
          Ain't nobody out here
          seen nothing?
    And I can't even get
    to my own child!
      - I'm sorry, ma'am.
      - What happened?
        Don't touch me!
   You don't even deserve
   to look at my child's body
            laying right there
            on this ground!
            None of you!
         <i> You gonna get</i>
         <i> your day, Lysistrata.</i>
                <i> You and your</i>
                <i> damn boyfriend.</i>
          You got what's coming.
I want you to look at her.
   <i> Look at her right there.</i>
        That's a seven--
        a little baby!
          A baby!
        A baby.
   I can't take this
   no more.
    Man:
    Your daughter's
    in heaven.
             Woman:
       <i> Because it could</i>
       <i> be you next time!</i>
            Will you be
            standing around
            looking then?
             This nothing
             has nowhere to go.
    Welcome to my home.
     Come on in.
     Come on.
             Woman:
     <i> Why don't you move in</i>
    <i> with that boy of yours,</i>
              Machine Gun Kelly?
Wouldn't be safe.
      I suppose he'll be gunning
      for who set that fire.
             Y'all make
             my tired ass tired.
    There are children here
         in Englewood.
         Does that mean
        anything to you?
     Running up the street,
     shooting and killing.
             Do you care at all?
    - Maybe I should leave.
    - No. Sit.
                          Stay.
        You're gonna deal
        with this today.
                  You don't have
                  any family?
       No, ma'am.
      I'm an orphan.
  My moms put me up
  for adoption at birth.
  I grew up moving
  from one group home
  to another.
                  Hmm.
         Lord help you, child.
   Where's your flat-screen?
        Malcolm X once said
        the best way to hide
        something from Negroes
        is to put it in a book.
    Well, I can dig it,
    Miss Helen.
   You sure got mad books.
          Books are my life.
          My life for books.
You always live here?
    No. I lived in Cabrini-Green
    back when it was clean,
    before they knocked it down.
     Oh, a lot of black folk
     got gentrified across town.
       - Who's this?
       - My daughter Pam.
      - Let me guess. 10?
      - That's right.
     <i> Fifth grade class picture.</i>
               Girl, come away
               from that window.
        - Hurry.
        - It's Chi-Raq.
Woman:<i> Oh, my God! </i>
                      Chi-Raq.
            I hate that name.
            It's not who we are.
Chicago always been
a straight up gangsta town.
             We are not Chi-Raq.
    So what you call
    all these shootings?
       Crime?
       Doing time?
    It's not just about Chicago.
        What about
        Bodymore, Murderland?
       Killa-delphia,
       City of Brotherly Murder?
           Bucktown--
           Brooklyn, New York.
So many people getting shot,
hospital's going broke.
  I mean, you got to get
  on the E-way.
   People dying en route.
    They can't even
    file a lawsuit.
I mean, there still
ain't no trauma centers
here on the South Side.
         There was
         a time in the summer
         when it got hot.
         Your child could
         go outside and play
         and not get shot.
     - Oh, I don't
       remember that time.
     - It existed.
  I'm sorry, Miss Helen,
  but it's a war zone
  out here.
        The US spends money
        on the Iraqi people,
            to train them,
            govern them,
            help them build
            an economy--
         billions and billions
         in dollars.
         The Afghan people, too.
        They don't do economic
        development like that
        here on the South Side.
       See, Americans like war.
            They like guns.
        - Fun and games.
        - Fun and games?
            Ask the parents
            at Sandy Hook.
   When they murder white babies
   and things don't change,
          saving black life
          is way out of range.
    I keep thinking
    about that mother
    that lost her child.
              You should.
      - This boy you with.
      - Chi-Raq?
        - What?
        - That's what
          they call him.
           Wait a minute, now.
           Hold on.
          They call him Chi-Raq?
       Yes, ma'am.
            Lord, have mercy!
      He's a rapper.
     I mean, gonna be
     big-time famous.
     You really
     never heard of him?
        I heard he was a leader
        in this gang mess, girl.
    Whoa, Miss Helen,
    now, they don't say
    "gang" anymore.
  They say "organization."
       What is his real name?
  His government name?
         Nah.
       Demetrius.
    Demetrius Dupree.
           Demetrius Dupree.
           His father?
All Chi's told me
is that he died in prison.
He's got a good heart
deep down inside.
      I love him.
    I can change Chi.
              Darling,
        people change when
        they decide to change.
       You make it sound
       so easy.
      All you can do is create
      an environment for change.
        Like an alcoholic,
        you take away his booze.
You just try
taking away their guns.
         All right, well,
         what else do they love?
Uh... getting turnt up,
making money.
               What else?
        Um...
                Yeah, well.
       Mm-hmm.
             Pick up your phone.
          Lysistrata:

   <i> to the senseless violence</i>
       <i> here in Englewood</i>
       <i> on the South Side</i>
          <i> of Chicago.</i>
       <i> What do you want</i>
        <i> people to know?</i>
    -<i> What can people do? </i>
    - Irene:<i> You know...</i>
these babies don't
ask to be caught up
in the middle of this.
They don't.
If y'all know anything,
if you've seen anything,
heard anything,
<i> please, do something.</i>
      Say something.
<i> Where's your heart?</i>
          What's up, girlfriend?
           You unhappy staying
           at Miss Helen's crib?
              You know how
              old people live.
           That ain't the thing,
           Rasheeda.
      - I'm on fire.
      - Burn, baby, burn.
         We agreed to hook up,
         make this plan.
      Where the females at, huh?
        Laid up with some man.
    - Oh, no.
    - Lysistrata:<i> Hell, no.</i>
           Hell, no!
       - Marcy! Tee-Tee!
       - It was today?
    Damn right
    it was today.
You know I was waiting
on a line from Jackson.
He's in Afghan
seeing action.
Waiting on his call,
I went to the mall.
Little man wanted
some Cap'n Crunch.
He eat it for breakfast,
maybe lunch.
   Get in the damn car.
   Sorry, Eddie.
     - Whose crib this be?
     - Indigo.
  Indigo?
Isn't that Cyclops's
main squeeze?
        Cyclops' bae?
         Yo, I got on purple.
             She a woman,
             we all black women.
             That's the matter
             at hand, sista.
Yeah, yeah, I can dig
your sista app,
but make sure
they don't bust no caps.
  - Can I help you?
  - Lysistrata:<i> 'Sup, Indigo?</i>
            You CoverGirl clean.
     That figure
     brick shithouse mean!
       Mm-hmm, this about
       who set your house
       on fire?
    - What y'all
      tired strags want?
    - Man, what y'all want?
Hey, man, chill
with that shrill before
I whup your butt, slut!
- Yo!
          I got a kid with me,
          y'all. Relax.
    - Peace!
      Peace and hair grease!
    - Calm down.
       - Check your girl!
       - Check her!
        Check the ignorance.
  - We all sistas here.
  - Bitch, I ain't your sista.
- This my running partner Dania
  and my ace boon coon Hecuba.
- What?
     - And I know you know
       Kenya the Rapper.
     - Lysistrata:<i> Nah.</i>
    I ain't putting out fear,
    so what y'all trying
    to steer?
         God forbid Cyclops find
         y'all Spartan tricks
         up in here.
     Everybody here got
     a man in the orange
     and purple colors,
     banging and slanging,
     fighting for the flag,
     risking that long zip
     of the cadaver bag.
      - It's how we live.
      - It's how we die.
You wanna lose
your man to a drive-by?
<i> In a pine box</i>
<i> 'fore he's 25?</i>
- I lost my cousin.
- And I lost my little brother.
               I lost my nephew.
My uncle got killed
two weeks ago,
and like always,
nobody saw nothing.
All to the bang-bang.
              All:
          Bang, bang.
    We've all lost people, too,
    many a sister and brother.
            Now, I'd like to see
            Cyclops and Chi
            put down that mess
            between the Trojans
            and the Greeks,
       but that day looks bleak.
    What if we could
    devise a method
    to end the bloodshed?
     Yo, count on me.
     You need money?
    I'll pawn all the gold
    around my neck,
    then get turnt up
    till I'm a wreck.
    Hey!
 I am ready
 to split myself
 up the middle,
 give you half.
                I'm down
                for the cause,
                but how?
        We force our men
        to negotiate peace
       by exercising
       cocksure self-control
      and total abstinence
      from knocking the boots.
I never did like
y'all Trojan chickenheads
any goddamn way--
     - Oh, no!
     - Yeah, you heard me!
    - Get up out of here.
    - Y'all kicking us out?
Get out of here.
Shoot 'em up.
            Trojans:
            Bang, bang.
            Please, please,
            just sit down.
    We ain't gonna be that long.
    Rasheeda, shut the fuck up.
    Give me
    one more minute.
    Hey, I got
    my son with me.
    I gotta go.
Marcy, this has to do
with your son.
            Just a minute ago,
            you was ready
            to split yourself
            up the middle.
            Go ahead,
            so y'all Spartans
            can get out of here.
         I just saw a mother
         weeping in the streets,
         her baby's blood spilt.
Man, you really think
something like that
could bring peace?
    Y'all know the power
    we have over them
withholding just a day.
        - A week?
        - You're right.
       - Ooh.
       - Imagine a month.
    A year!
Oh, they gonna
bring the peace!
      Suppose-- suppose
      that the men just dump us.
 If we all hold out,
 who can they go to?
              All:
           The THOTs.
            Them hos over there!
Well, we will
enlist them, too.
        If we want
        our men alive,
       we want our babies
       to thrive,
   we gonna have to organize.
        Repeat after me.
  I will deny all rights

             Women:

      Women: ...who comes

Uh, come on.
Say it!
       - Come on.
       - Girl, I can't--
     - I can't do this. No!
     - Come on!
If he should force me to lay

             Women:
  If he should force me to lay

...I will refuse his stroke
and not give up
that nappy pouch.
             Women:
  ...I will refuse his stroke
       and not give up
       that nappy pouch.
           No peace?
              All:
           No pussy!
              Ah!
          The red wine
        has been drunk.
    The plan is now struck.
         Dolmedes must
        tell you fellas,
   y'all about to get punked.
    Lysistrata had them all
      take a solemn oath.
    Stop the murder madness
       or there would be
         no more pokes.
       Some even thought
      the shit was a hoax.
     How could them females
     give up the long dick
      and the downstroke?
          This must be
         some bullshit!
     Ain't no fucking way!
           But y'all
       about to find out
     these gals don't play.
        No more poonani,
          nookie-pie,
     beehive, or honeybun.
          No coochie,
        no nappy dugout.
         That's right.
         You gets none.
              Men:
           Say what?
            Chi-Raq:
     <i> To be so damn smart,</i>
        you know
        you're tweaking, right?
          You lame as hell,
          playing games for real
            <i> with this wack-ass</i>
            <i> panty strike,</i>
            and that's that shit
            we don't like.
              You wanna choose
              to be rude?
        Bitches gonna be tight
        when you make 'em
        lose they dudes.
    I don't know who you think
    you're trying to change.
          I'm Trojan
          through and through.
            That's stronger
            than any damn screw.
                It's even bigger
                than you.
All you care about
is this tired gangsta game.
Well, it's lame!
You think
you'll die with fame?
Negro, two days later,
no one will even
remember your name.
      Your machismo
      is really masochism.
That's why
I'm cutting off your jism.
As long as you love
the life more than a wife,
        we strike.
             Why you so frigid?
            Why don't you let me
            thaw you out
            with this ice pick?
       You know you can't resist
       a chocolate lick.
               Chill out.
              Your next move
              is your best move,
          and it gonna be smoo--
            Fine.
            Remember that
            little kiddie rhyme.
         369, Indigo drank wine.
            Made the chicks walk
            that no sex line.
        But the line broke,
        and them bitches choked.
          And Lysistrata
          and her former friends
          got replaced
          by some tighter pokes.
                  Bye.
            - Be...
            - Safe!
        What's happening with
        the jump-off, Bacchos?
            We got the cheese.
            Where the nachos?
         Spartans trying to have
         the club on lock, yo!
It's rough out here!
            It's Saturday night.
            We getting tight?
Not tonight.
Ain't no partying,
no dancing, no getting down.
   - Why?
   - Ain't a broad to be had.
    Just a bunch of
    hardheads going stag.
        It's the same
        all over town.
    Clubs is closing down.
    Man, these womens
    have vanished.
     Even the hos
     is no-shows.
            What the fuck
            is this, though?
    What the hell?
I'll be goddamned.
      What the--
            Shee...
             eee...
           eee... it.
     <i> All right, peep this.</i>
I got 30 girls
stripping for me,
another five on loan,
and not one of them,
not one of them is answering
their goddamn phone.
              This shit is wack.
Yeah, I mean,
at this time of the night,
the champagne room
would be full of life.
Young boys
putting dollar bills
in the drawers
of all my pretty thrills.
Cyclops, we have
been struck by a plague
that will put that biblical
pestilence shit to shame.
  And this famine only affects
  the lower regions
  where all you young Trojans
   do most of your thinking.
    I mean, this is the male
       side of the aisle.
    If you can't squeeze it,
      you at least wanna--
            wanna--
      you know, tease it.
        Oh, but-- but--
  but these hos have literally
           <i> shut down</i>
     <i> the penis power grid.</i>
So my question to y'all
is what
you motherfuckers
done did?
             <i> Huh?</i>
        <i> The situation's</i>
        <i> out of control,</i>
      'cause I'm in front
   of an empty stripper pole!
        But you still got soul,
        so you know your pole
        is-- is gold.
Cyclops. Cyclops,
keep your eye on me.
    Yo, we got you, Morris.
    Don't worry about this, man.
           I got this.
           Know what I'm saying?
             I got it between
             my crosshairs, nah?
What you need
is another eye.
There's not even
half an ass to look at.
            One of these days,
            man, you know,
          you're gonna get tired
          of them one-eye jokes
          and shit.
Sorry, man,
I'm a little uptight
because there ain't no pussy
in the club tonight.
Where's yours on standby?
I can't sell standby.
I need some active duty,
first-class, "va-gina."
           You need
           active duty... booty?
           Active duty... booty.
I'm glad you can find
humor in this.
    Sometimes
    that shit just come to me.
    I don't even know how, man.
You know what, man?
I would like
to have somebody
on that pole tonight.
            Beast, pole, baby.
 It's not that kind
 of club, young man.
    Hey, man, go and get
    on the pole.
                What kind of
                insubordination
                is this shit?
- Oh, no, we got it, boss.
-<i> You need all you can get, Mo!</i>
      - Relax, I got this.
      -<i> Get yours, son.</i>
 -<i> Yeah, do that shit. </i>
 -<i> Do that spin, do that spin.</i>
     - Whoo!
     -<i> Yeah, that's right.</i>
Hey, yo, Big Thelma,
where you going?
     The US Virgin Islands,
       a place my girls
       ain't never seen.
               Well, where
               your girls be at?
         My bitches
         told me to go,
      say they're honoring
      the strike.
      Say they don't care
      who likes.
         - A ho strike?
         - Shit, yeah.
     Good thing I'm a dyke.
Can you believe this shit?

    I'm gonna talk
    about a life today.
    An important life...
    in our community.
       A life...
     that ends life.
        The life...
         of a gun.
    - Man:<i> Ah, yeah. </i>
    - Miss Helen:<i> Oh, mercy!</i>
    <i>  Mercy.</i>
   - Woman: Oh.
   - Woman #2: That's right!
         This gun began
    its professional career
     when it was purchased
   by Tiny Tony from Chicago
     at an Indiana gun show
    using a fake Indiana ID
        and bypassed all
    of our strict gun laws.
         Chicago gangs
          buy the guns
        for big money...
          Miss Helen:
        <i> Break it down.</i>
      - for their work...
      -<i> Mm-hmm.</i>
in the underground economy.
          Miss Helen:
        Tell the truth!
         That's right.
     The underground
     economy exists
because banks
and lending institutions
  rarely loan money
  to poor people.
         Is that right?
                    Right.
                    Say it!
  Their children, however,
  admire the thug life.
      But they do so
      from the safety
      of suburban Chicago!
    - That's right!
    - Kenilworth, Wilmette,
      Highland Park.
                 No, no, no, no.
    This gun wouldn't be
    caught dead there.
        This gun is
        the principal player
               in a reality TV
               urban murder show
            that can
            be seen every night
            at 5:00 and 10:00,
    every channel,
    on any news show
    you wanna watch.
            And that's when
            this gun...
           met our child Patti.
      -<i> Patti. </i>
      - Woman:<i> Yeah! Yeah!</i>
                Patti is gone...
because our politicians
are in the pocket
of the National
Rifle Association!
They have become
their mouthpieces
or silent
co-conspirators!
Patti is gone...
because of an economy
that has abandoned the poor.
        Downtown they say
        unemployment is 5.7%.
       How's that sound?
<i> Right here</i>
<i> in Auburn Gresham,</i>
            unemployment is 21%!
   And that doesn't even count
   people who have given up hope
            and stopped
            looking for work.
The per capita income
is $12,000!
        42% of us live
        below the poverty line.
          30% don't have
          a high school diploma.
          What America
          are they living in?
        Yes!
              We go from
              third-rate schools
              to first-class
              high-tech prisons.
Mass incarceration
is the new Jim Crow!
    Our Patti is gone
      because gang members
       are more concerned
       with popping pills
      and popping bottles,
         more concerned
    with what's on YouTube!
             Woman:
     <i> Say it, Father Mike!</i>
    More concerned with ego,
     street cred, and greed
    than a human life.
    Patti's gone because
    guns have become
    a part
    of America's wardrobe.
             Woman:
     <i> Preach, Father Mike!</i>
       Where it is easier
 to get a gun than a computer.
      Sirens and gunshots
      are our soundtrack.
      Yellow police tape,
          teddy bears,
      T-shirts, balloons--
           these are
     the national memorials
     of our neighborhoods.
    And it doesn't
    look good.
              Man:
        <i> Take your time!</i>
             Woman:
            <i> Preach!</i>
 It didn't look good...
    when the sky turned dark
          and the sun
        refused to shine
      and the earth
      began to quake
     and they laid
     Jesus's lifeless body
        <i> at the arms</i>
        <i> of Mother Mary!</i>
Woman:<i> Yeah! Preach! </i>
         And I don't need to go
         back to biblical times!
          It didn't look good
          in a Birmingham church
       when four little girls
       were blown apart by hate!
It didn't look good
when Medgar was laying
bleeding to death
in his driveway.
It didn't look good
when Malcolm was shot down
on the Audubon stage!
         And it didn't look good
         when Martin Luther King
           stood on the balcony
           of the Lorraine Motel
        outside room 306
           and at 6:03
           was taken from us!
           And, no,
           it doesn't look good!
    Not when Patti was lost
        on a busy street
with folks going
to work and school,
with cars passing by!
    How is it possible?
     How is it possible
     that not one witness
     has come forward?
                Not one!
How is it possible
that no one has the courage
and the conscience
to speak up for this family!
                 Somebody knows!
              Somebody, help me!
                       Somebody!
                <i> Somebody knows!</i>
    Cynics say,
    "Well, if I snitch,
    I'll be killed, too."
First of all,
when a murderer walks free,
we are all in danger!
But if multiple folks
come forward,
multiple folks
who witnessed these murders,
there is no one target!
  What makes someone a target
      is not the shooter.
              Man:
         <i> That's right!</i>
What makes someone a target
is the community
that surrenders to fear...
             Woman:
             <i> Yes!</i>
...and becomes silent.
          That's why
          we at St. Sabina
            must put out
            a $5,000 reward
     for information
     leading to the arrest
of Patti's killer
or any killer!
     Because we need to say
     loud and clear,
             "You cannot murder
             our children!"
    You cannot murder
    our children,
   then go back to the crib,
    turn on "SportsCenter,"
    eat a Whopper and fries,
      and act like nothing
         ever happened.
We will not allow
this self-inflicted
genocide to continue.
  We will not allow
  this self-inflicted
  genocide to continue.
      This is a disgrace!
      This is a disgrace!
    Patti lives!
    Patti lives!
          And Patti
          will have justice!
      - Do you have faith?
      - Crowd: Yes!
     - Do you want justice?
     - Yes!
 Are you willing
 to get up and walk?
           - Yes!
           - Get up!
          Hope wins!
                  Peace wins!
         - Goodness...
         - Wins!
       - Righteousness...
       - Wins!
            - Love!
            - Wins!
            - Love!
            - Wins!
            - Love!
            - Wins!

                I thought you
                were all insane.
          But on further review,
            as a man who's taken
            a vow of celibacy,
         I know the power
         of the sexual appetite.
               I know this fruit
               is ripe.
                 But understand,
                 your ruse won't
                 bring a truce.
Well, what will bring peace?
            How about a job?
            Affordable housing.
            A good education.
            Purpose, hope.
              There's a lot
              of hate out there.
           A lot of self-hate.
           A lot of racial hate.
       That Charleston massacre?
      Murdered at
      a prayer meeting.
       - Hate crimes.
       - Assassinations.
         Domestic terrorists.
               South Kakalaki.
               First to secede,
               last to concede.
      They built the Citadel
      to take on Mother Emanuel.
        It's the oldest
        AME church in the South,
          founded by
          Denmark Vesey in 1822.
           Their heritage
           is white supremacy,
           through and through.
        That evil young Klansman
        Dylann Storm Roof?
               He's the proof.
             Post-racial-- poof.
   Storm wants
   his country back.
   - Storm ain't getting it.
   - It ain't his!
              Storm is from
              a way of hate,
              and we may not
              be able to relate.
         Those murders came from
         a lower Carolina state.
     Historically speaking,
     evil's in that boy's blood.
             Well, now,
             the brothas
             on the block?
      They do the white man's
      murderous bidding for him.
    Now, that form of hate,
    we can't translate.
             It enunciates.
        But I will
        exterminate myself,
        my kind, me!
                     Us.
           The question remains.
              Can your plan
              save us from us?
                  Man:
                  Company, halt!
     - About face!
     - Ain't that your boy?
      <i> General King Kong?</i>
             He wishes.
            That's why I quit.
          Lysistrata:
     <i> You know, John Brown</i>
       <i> raided an armory</i>
       <i> at Harper's Ferry</i>
   <i> when he freed the slaves.</i>
    Show me what you're made of.
    Right here, right now!
           Assume the position!
              General King Kong?
 I wan to enlist.
                     Young lady,
           speak to one of our
           recruiting sergeants.
        No, General!
  My bestie Rasheeda,
  she served under you.
  She told me,
  "Get behind that
  General King Kong."
Said you's
a commanding officer.
              Young lady...
            may I speak to you
            in private?
          <i> Dick, H.W.,</i>
       <i> Rice-A-Roni, W.,</i>
            <i> Rummy.</i>
                     No Clinton?
               Where's President
               Hussein Obama?
      I'd rather
      have an African lion
      in the White House,
      than a lyin' African.
               You're too funny,
               General.
           Young lady, I'm about
           to show you something
           few people have seen.
         This is one of the most
         important artifacts
         of the Civil War,
            affectionately known
            as Whistling Dick
               because
               of the terrifying
               sound it made
   when it went off
   and wreaked its deadly havoc.
        Saved our Rebs
        time and time again.
What do you call this,
General?
              The rammer.
Let me show you
how it works.
        Oh! Oh!
Shove it in the hole
like so.
    - Push it down real low,
      as far as it will go.
    - Uh-huh.
- And you
  pull it out real slow.
           Look at you, General!
    Oh!
Oh!
       I'm always prepared.
   Sucky sucky now.
Oh, you know
what would get me
really Alabamy hot?
               What? What?
               Tell me.
        - Hand to hand?
        - Oh, no.
   Watch you mount
   old Whistling Dick.
          - Ride it?
          - Oh, yeah.
Yeah, like you old
General Stonewall Jackson
coming to rescue
little old darkie me
from those Yankees.
    - It would turn you on?
    - Yeah.
   I'm not just
   whistling Dixie.
      Oh!
      Whoo!
    Here we go!
    Come on!
           - Ride it.
           - Yeah.
        - Ride it.
          You like that?
        - Yeah, come on.
             Yeah!
    Let that pretty
    black steel
      ride up
      your pretty pelvis.
           Son of a bitch,
           this is good.
           This is good.
           Yeah!
     - You like that?
     - Now come here,
       you black stallion.
            It's time to light
            this cannon.
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
One more thing.
              What?
            Now this right here,
            General,
              this'll really
              turn me on.
But I'm blind.
        - I'm blind.
        - Yes, you are.
            Here, now give me
            those hands.
    You want my fingertips?
         What you gonna
         do with them?
            I want all of you.
            Oh, you like that?
  Yeah, that's so sweet.
      - Sweetie, come on.
      - Feel that?
             Now you mine now,
             General.
          Yeah, here we go.
Yeah!
      I'm your Whistling Dick.
          I'm your little
          Whistling Dick.
- <i> Whistle.</i>
<i> Whistle like</i>
<i> you want it, baby.</i>
      Now come here, you little
      nappy-headed ho.
           Come on, mama.
        Bring it,
        my little burr head.
              Come on.
             Here we go.
            Wait a minute.
           What in tarnation
           is this?
           This is an act
           of treason.
            You a black
            nigra ISIS.
Come on! Come on!
           Move it! Move it!
           Move it! Move it!
           Move it!
           - Go! Go!
           - Freeze!
Man: Don't shoot!
  Don't shoot!
           Please, don't shoot.
           Don't shoot!
- Move! Move!
       Is this the police
       or SEAL team two?
      And you're surprised
       there's derision?
          If this was
       your neighborhood,
       what would you do?
          Look at all
         this weaponry.
  Shit look like an invasion,
       not a persuasion.
       All this for some
    unarmed women of color?
   I think something got lost
        in translation.
       They say they come
     to protect and serve,
     but the real truth is
      they get the chance,
     they treat these girls
        like Eric Garner
        selling loosies.
       Let's get truthy.
        Cops and gangs,
     black and brown folks
      stuck in the middle.
     Shit's on fire, y'all.
           I can hear
         Nero's fiddle.
    Can't trust the police.
      Afraid of the gangs.
    This whole motherfucking
        thing is insane.
         What happened
         to the officer
          on the beat?
   And this banger sure ain't
    mama nem's little treat.
          Miss Helen:
  <i> First I wanna thank you all</i>
        <i> for showing up.</i>
    <i> We all know that enough</i>
<i> is enough and too much stinks,</i>
  <i> so we need to come together</i>
 <i> in agreement about this oath.</i>
             Woman:
          <i> What oath?</i>
          Miss Helen:
         <i> Swearing off</i>
     <i> the one-eyed monster.</i>
             Women:
             What?
Miss Helen,
as an attorney,
I know the trip.
I convict our youngsters
to this new slave ship.
If I do take the oath,
how will it sink
that bloody boat?
          Althea, it won't work.
You just like
having your man
by the Jackie Robinsons.
      Right, and that's why
      Sugar Pie man don't stray.
         I keeps that bone dry
         and also keep myself
         looking fly.
Oh, so that's why you wear
them too-tight numbers
 and fishnets
 or Daisy Dukes.
Big old ripple up ass
hanging all out the shoot.
Oh, y'all wanna laugh?
      It's funny?
      Little broke ass
      Destiny's Child over here.
   You wanna laugh?
   Don't talk about
   my big ass.
   We all got some bumps
   and bruises and cigarette
   burns on asses.
 - Speak for yourself.
 - What about you and your man?
  Old Duke wanna hit
  that big butt,
  you ain't gonna
  give it up?
              Ole Duke and me
              is separated.
   Girl, please.
   You still wanna hit that.
            Even if I did,
            which I don't,
I will not violate
the oath.
  Now, sisters, come on.
  This isn't a joke.
   We all have
   a stake in this fray.
   You know mine.
   So forget about
   your personal needs.
         I'll be damned
    if another child bleeds.
 Oh, Dr. Miss Aesop
 has the floor.
 A woman wise
 beyond her years.
 Maybe she can help us
 dry this river of tears.
       As a pediatrician
         for 50 years,
        I was dedicated
      to preserving life.
 God, nature,
 the higher power
 put more nerves
 in a man's thing
 than he ever did
 in his brain.
 Thus, the women
 must save the babies.
         Save the babies.
 It's time to get that gate
 of motherhood locked up.
         - Lock it up.
         - Lock it up.
         - Lock it up.
         - Lock it up.
         - Lock it up.
         - Lock it up.
    - Women:
      Lock it up! Lock it up!
    - Hold up, hold up.
           Hold the fuck up!
              If I lose my man,
              I'm gonna cut all
              of y'all.
         Shit!
                 Fuck it.
               Lock it up.
Knights of Euphrates,
these females
      think this is gonna
        stop the gangs.
       Ain't this a blip?
       Silly rabbits on
       a stone-cold trip.
I told Sugar Pie
before I left the house,
Apollo ain't
no goddamn mouse.
She don't want
to give it up,
I'll find me some
brand-new fresh ass butt.
There's too much ass
for all that trash.
    Hey, ain't y'all heard?
   The phone sex women,
   they honoring the strike.
    And the porno
    all closing the nookie.
    I mean, not even
    a fucking lookie.
Fellas,
they shutting it all down
tighter than fish pussy.
And you know that shit
is waterproof.
Waterproof.
   Tight, tight.
           What you gotta say,
           Oedipus?
          Well, I asked
          my mommy last night
          and she said
          the women are right.
         - Your mommy?
         - Yes.
    Skinny nigga, sometimes
    I think you married
    to your damn mommy.
         Well, I love my mother
         and my mommy loves me.
    Gentlemen, I am proud
    to say that I was breast-fed
    till I was 12 years old.
                   TMI.
         <i> I hear some straight</i>
         <i> dude's been making</i>
         late-night appearances
         on "Queer Sex for
         the Straight Guy."
     Yeah, and the brothers
     on the down low,
     even they saying
     no blow.
             Nigga,
             what did you say?
   How I know that,
   I don't know.
  Well, at my age,
  I thought my missus
               was just a pest.
       But Lord have mercy,
       she's a sexual terrorist.
     And who do we have
     to blame?
         - Oprah?
         - Women's lib?
      Uppity ass women!
Let's give them frails
           a dose of they own
           damn tail.
    We'll let them
    twilly tarts know
    who makes them groan
    and moan and hoot.
                And bring home
                the damn loot.
       So what we gonna do,
       Ole Duke?
              We took
              those flags once.
          We can take 'em again.
        Poindexter's old, unh,
        but he can still go.
 - You saying do it ourselves?
 - That's the plan, Stan.
         Unless you always wanna
         have that in your
         greasy old hand.
           Knights of Euphrates,
           rise up.
 Like the battles
 of the past,
 we shall come together
 to whup some female ass.
 Let us not stand
 for their flapping lips
     nor their chronic
     nagging bullshit.
     - Are we mice or men?
     - Men: Men!
         We shall redeem
         the power of our breed
     with one mighty thrust
     into the misty mist
     and the dusky dusky.
     - What makes a muskrat
       guard his musk?
     - Courage!
    - What makes the Sphinx
      the seventh wonder?
    - Courage!
    - What makes the dawn
      come up like thunder?
    - Courage!
       What makes Venus
       Hottentot so hot?
            What puts the dance
            in the robot?
          What we got
      that they ain't got?
        Courage?
     Fuck, no. A dick.
     Blue balls.
        Reporter: Miss Helen,
        I see you out here with
        all these ladies today.
         What do you hope
         to accomplish?
  Lysistrata's platform
  coincides
   with the mayor's
   10-point plan to end
   gun violence.
     Her demands
     are our demands.
      Why do you think
      your demands and your plan
      will work better than what
      the mayor has put forward?
    Because we have one,
    and it's to save
    our children.
     We need to stop
     this violence
     in the street.
    He's distracted.
    He has many things
    that he's concerned about.
     We are concerned
     about our babies
    and we are talking
    to our men in our homes
    in the bedroom.
    I think they'll
    listen then.
           I ain't in no gang.
        You telling me you gonna
        stop giving my girl
      from giving me what I need
      because your man
      is the leader of the gang
      and he out there shooting
      and killing?
 - Don't make sense.
 - I don't understand that.
   I ain't a part of that party.
        I'm old enough to know
        that I'm supposed to do
        what I'm supposed to do.
    She old enough
    to know she's supposed to do
    what she's supposed to do.
        Now, them young kids,
        they the ones out here
        tripping like that.
No peace, no pussy.
Women, you need us.
          Do your duty
      and drop that booty.
      No peace, no pussy.
    Negotiate and copulate.
      Women, you need us.

      No peace, no pussy.
    Negotiate and copulate.
- - That's where they are.
We can bring a team here
all the way across
by the main underneath
and surprise them.
I wonder
who sent him.
         So what is this, Chief?
        At approximately
          1500 hours,
    75 women took possession
         of the armory.
       They had hostages,
      they released them.
    - Women did this?
    - Black and brown women.
 - Black and brown women?
 - Just black and brown women.
        - How many dead?
        - Zero.
        - Just wounded?
        - Nada.
          They packing
          some big muscle, huh?
      No, sir, they appear
      to be unarmed.
    - How many?
    - Approximately 75, sir.
   Are you telling me
   that 75 black and brown women
      took a United States
      military armory unarmed?
 Yes, sir.
        "No peace, no pussy."
         What the hell
         is going on, Riptide?
   Don't let that foolishness
       outside scare you.
           The armory
     is our chastity belt.
     I will deny all rights
    of access or entrance...

      - Lock it up!
      - Women: Lock it up!
Lock it up!
   Lock it up!
    Lock it up! Lock it up!
          Lock it up!
Hello?
              Man:
       <i> Jesus H. Christ.</i>
         -<i> Mr. Mayor. </i>
         - Hang on.
   Everybody out
   there in the world,
   take this, too.
   You're part of this.
   Take this vow.
    Did you know this woman
  used to work for my office?
        No, I didn't know that,
        Your Honor.
            It's your job
            to know!
         She was a secretary.
         But she's not typing
         letters anymore.
     Oh, no, she's getting
     the other secretaries
     to walk off the job.
     She's leading a revolt.
    I could lose the female vote
    over this stupid joke.
  <i> Jesus, you know how I feel</i>
      <i> about this baloney.</i>
        <i> I can't afford</i>
     <i> to look like a phony.</i>
          Damned if I do,
          damned if I don't.
       Either way, I'm gonna
       have a friggin' stroke.
    - Let's see how
      serious they are.
    -<i> What's your meaning?</i>
   - Perhaps we should
     let them get the feeling.
   -<i> The feeling?</i>
      Instead of us breaking in,
      we close them off.
       Build a perimeter,
       a wall around them.
      - Wall?
      -<i> Operation</i>
      <i>  Hot and Bothered.</i>
    <i> Your Honor, we surround</i>
   <i> the armory with speakers</i>
<i> blasting one of those romantic</i>
   <i> slow jams from the '70s.</i>
    Those crooning brothers
  will make those mommies wet
    and make them wanna jet.
    <i> Those chastity belters</i>
   <i> will end their sex strike</i>
     <i> and climb Mount Pike.</i>
       We run the ball
       right down their throats.
        With total male pride,
        Mayor, you win this
        with their appetite.
     You never have to say
        you were right.
        You never attack
       or call them weak.
  - And you always
    seek the peace.
  - You're a deviant bastard.
         That's why I went
         into public service,
         Your Honor.
       Touchdown, Bears!
              Rah!
  Love you.
      No peace, no pussy!
      No peace, no pussy!
      No peace, no pussy!
    Lysistrata! Lysistrata!
    Lysistrata! Lysistrata!
     Hello. Hi.
     Good afternoon.
     Excuse me.
     Would you happen to be
     Ms. Clara Worthy?
         No, sir.
         And who might you be?
  I am Mr. Morrowburns.
      How might I help you, sir?
    Ms. Clara Worthy,
    is she around?
 Is this the right address?
 6328 Elizabeth Avenue, right?
      - Yes, it is.
      - Do you know
        Ms. Clara Worthy?
     Well, I better.
     Clara's my younger sister.
       I'm Ms. Helen Worthy.
    Wonderful.
    Pleased to meet you.
    I love your garden.
    It's very beautiful.
     - Well, thank you.
     - Is your sister here?
         No, sir.
         You just missed her.
        Clara's going on up
        to Jackson, Mississippi,
        to visit our parents.
  - You're kidding.
  -<i> Yeah, she left last night.</i>
        - I have cousins
          in Jackson.
        - Do you?
  <i> I do.</i>
  <i> We might be kin.</i>
       - Might could be.
       - Might could be.
   Listen, could you give
   your sister a message
   for me, please?
       Well, that's gonna
       depend on the message.
           Right.
- Oh.
        Oh, Red, White, and Blue
        Insurance Company.
     We got word
     in the home office
     that your sister
     has a young son,
     a teenager by the name
     of Homer Worthy.
<i> I came to tell</i>
<i> your sister that she</i>
<i> really should consider</i>
 <i> taking out</i>
 <i> a life insurance</i>
 <i> policy on Homer</i>
 <i> because I'm sure</i>
 <i> you know that young black</i>
 <i> boys on the South Side</i>
  are more than likely
  to be shot and/or killed.
<i> And so the Red, White,</i>
<i> and Blue Insurance Company</i>
   is hoping to help
   single mothers
   like your sister
   in case of a tragedy
  <i> because, of course,</i>
  <i> it's always better to be</i>
  <i> safe than to be sorry.</i>
    - Mr. Burnsmorrow--
      whatever your name is.
    -<i> Morrowburns.</i>
    If you don't leave here
    right now right this second,
     you're gonna need
     a goddamn insurance policy
     your goddamn self
     coming up here in my garden
     with this here bullshit!
                 Leave!
      - Leave!
      - It's Morrowburns.
        Do you think I give
        a flying fuck
        about your
        fucked-up name?
        Get on off
        the street, man.
                Have a nice day,
                ma'am.
         Go on back up
         to the big house
   - and you tell
     them it didn't work.
   - Have a nice day, ma'am.
    Out here trying
    to take advantage
    of your own goddamn people.

 You are crazy like glue.
                  One time...
                I saw my mom
                and this dude
                getting it in...
           right after my daddy
           got killed.
        Dude named Blue Monday
        used to come around and
        try to pimp on my moms.
          She turned a few
          rent tricks, I think.
<i> Kill me!</i>
           <i> Kill me!</i>
           <i> Kill me!</i>
       <i> Kill this pussy!</i>
       <i> Kill this pussy!</i>
           Go on, nigga,
           didn't I tell your
           skinny black ass
           to knock before you
           come in my bedroom?
           I'm sorry, Mommy.
          Demetrius, close
          the goddamn door!
<i> Demetrius, go!</i>
     Did you understand
     they was making love?
                That's what
                they was doing?
              Looked more like
              fighting, fucking,
              and screwing.
           Blue Monday knew that
           I saw him and Moms.
             Her name was Lucy.
             So one day he just
             pulled me aside,
        yanked my chain,
        laced me with the games,
         showed me how to pull
         bitches and everything.
             He soft-pitched me
             my first piece.
                I was, like,
                12 years old.
           Taught me how
           to be a man and shit.
          Handed me his baddest
          bottom bitch.
       It was a present
       for washing his Cadillac.
        - My God.
        - I know, right?
          Should have got like
          two or three bitches.
             I washed the shit
             out that Cadillac.
    Where's your moms now?

    -<i> You're getting soft.</i>
          People call it soft,
          but think about all
          the niggas we lost.
 They told me it was gonna
 be rough when I got out
 of the joint,
 but I didn't know
 it was gonna be like this.
What about the war wounds, baby?
War wounds don't mean nothing?
    Yeah, the war wounds
    was when it meant something.
        So what about your name
        in the game, huh?

      You're not gonna listen?
     - Bro, you can
       at least talk to me.
     - Okay, okay.
    - Let's talk eye to eye.
    - Okay. Okay, yeah.
Eye to eye patch.

Bitches and hos,

                With our keys,
                we shall unlock
          the sacred brotherhood
          of male needs
          and seize the means
          of reproduction.
    Those chastity belts
    are no match for a manly
    man's keys.
    Time to let
    that thing breathe.
         So pack up this
         Gloria Steinem act
        and get y'all ass
        back in the damn sack.
Take off
those chastity belts
and surrender the armory.
Nobody moves,
nobody gets hurt.
       - You all right?
       - What's going on?
             Well, well, well.
         What's up?
       That all you got?
     Girl, this sex strike
      scheme ain't nothing
        but a wet dream.
      You're trying to act
     all NFL Roger Goodell.
         Wench, please,
      all you chicks gonna
         burn in hell.
          Don't worry.
       If you act polite
      and not all saditty,
    we just might issue you
        some damn pity.
       Nah, see, we don't
          wanna fight,
       but you Cro-Magnon
      can't walk upright.
         You old dudes,
       you lack insight.
         Who your mommy
           and daddy?
        I gots no mommy
           and daddy.
   - You ain't got no folks?
   - Everybody's my folks.
        So you never had
     a pappy to school you
       on the female way.
         It takes a man
       to teach a heifer
    like you how to behave.
   I'm sorry that our effort
     to reform has left you
       unable to perform.
  But even before the strike,
    that's what your penile
      implants was like--
             soft.
               Women:
               Oh, snap!
          You trifling
      little black bitch.
             This ain't no joke.
      You old tired dicks
    just want a Viagra poke.
      Dude, this is about
        life and death,
       about a community
        that's a wreck.
     And you wanna sit here
and talk about how women behave?
    Fool, we trying to free
         these slaves.
     Slaves to the madness.
    Slaves to this violence.
   And what, you just want us
          to silence?
 We gonna make sure these fools
      put down these guns
       and stop thinking
  that this craziness is fun.
           You see, we women,
           we understand
      that life is about more
      than polishing your knobs.
          Saving lives,
          that's our job.
       It's about bringing
       an end to this strife
     and giving the hood
     the true meaning of life.
        What is the true
        meaning of life?
        You don't know?
        Ole Duke, why don't
        we go home, huh?
        My mommy is worried
        about you and I
        and the Knights.
    - Lysistrata:<i> Your mommy? </i>
    - Rasheeda:<i> Yeah, yeah.</i>
    <i>  Whatever.</i>
         <i> Your mommy's</i>
        <i> on strike, too.</i>
       <i> Thank you, guys.</i>
    <i> Bye, have a good night.</i>
           And don't forget,
           no peace...
             Women:
           No pussy.
      No peace, no pussy.
                Damn!
           Brooklyn,
       put the guns down.
  Brooklyn, put the guns down.
           Brooklyn,
       put the guns down.
 <i> Brooklyn, put the guns down.</i>
           <i> Brooklyn,</i>
      <i> put the guns down.</i>
          <i> Brooklyn...</i>
  The president
  called me this morning.
      - The president?
      - He was very upset.
         World leaders
         are in crisis.
      The infrastructures
      of their country
      are collapsing.
      The leader
      of the free world
    thinks the entire matter
    is my fault.
           Mr. Mayor,
           it's not your fault.
That's right because
it's your cocksucking fault!
 The President
 of the United States
 called me a name today.
      - No, Mr. Mayor.
      - Oh, yes. Oh, yes.
    The President
    of the United States
    of America
  called me a motherfucking
  sorry-ass punk-ass bitch.
  Oh, yes.
  It seems the First Lady
  has taken the oath.
 And what's worse,
 my wife has taken the oath.
She's a sexy young thing.
   Beautiful.
   Former model/stripper.
        Honey, I'm home.
 Wife:
<i> I'm in the bedroom.</i>
         Imhotep arrives.
       - Oh. Oh.
       - Ahoy, my queen.
           Oh, Mr. Mayor, baby.
           I am so hot.
               Your Honor.
               My pharaoh.
 I will now take
 my Chi-Town Cleopatra.
                No peace,
                no pussy.
  If I can't have
  my wife's pretty bottom,
    from your tush
    I'll find meaning.
    And you'll be squealing
    like you were in that
    movie "Deliverance."
   Give this Lysistrata
   what she wants.
 - She wants world peace.
 - Give her fucking world peace!
     You read me?
     Get the job done!
              Man:
       <i> Chi-Raq! Chi-Raq!</i>
You know
I knew your pops.
          Father's in there.
           I'm good.
    We need you and the Spartans
    to come down to the armory
         and join
         in the peach talks.
 Fuck I care if these
 lames ain't getting ass?
 Ain't my task.
      So Lysistrata's
      not your woman?
   Now you're fucking
   with my rep.
          Bigger than
       your fucking rep.
      Ain't no such thing.
     Father, you know what
 I've always wanted to ask you?
        What a white boy
            like you
   doing all up in the E-Dub
        all these years?
     I grew up eight blocks
        from St. Sabina.
       When I took a vow
        to be a priest,
  it had to be in the streets
      'cause Jesus rolled
       with the suffering
         and the poor.
        Imagine no more
         stray bullets
   killing innocent children
      like Patti no more.
       Bullets ain't got
       no name, no eyes.
         <i> That's right.</i>
     They're just designed
         to take lives.
    Like they'll take yours
           soon, son.
          Three places
     you're gonna end up--
         county morgue,
        county hospital
        or county jail.
        <i> People downtown</i>
 <i> don't give a fuck about you.</i>
       You in the system.
          You in jail.
    And you won't make bail.
    And it's privatized now
         to capitalize.
    No more insurance card.
    No more family to feed.
    You hanging from a tree.
        You're not even
      costing them money.
         You're making
          them money.
       And nobody's gonna
       hear your bitching
      'cause this is a new
    legal form of lynching.
   That's all you got,
   huh, Padre Miguel?
   God loves you.
   I love you.
 And I believe
 in my heart you have
 a higher purpose than this.
         Presided over
     your father's funeral.
       That mean anything
            to you?
 That enough for your
 little collection basket?
            Thank you
            for the donation...
   towards the $5,000 bounty
     leading to the arrest
       of Patti's killer.
      <i> I'll pray for you.</i>
           <i> Be safe.</i>
           Hey, hey.
      Come on, let's go.
      Any chance you could
      pull your pants up?
       Yo, Lys.
       It's me, Chi.
           Come to your senses?
     - I got a proposition.
     - Speak.
         - A showdown.
         - A showdown?
        - That's right.
        - Who?
   - Me and you.
   - I'm not gonna shoot you.
   Not a death match.
   It's a sex match.
  First one
  to surrender loses.
           You lose,
       you end all this.
       No charges filed.
 You'll make a public statement
    apologizing to all men.
      It's over.
      Done with.
               And when I win?
You get whatever it is
you're trying to do.
                  P-E-A-C-E.
     P-I-E-C-E.
               Pretty damn sure
               of yourself.

                        <i> A few.</i>
    Especially in the AM.
     You always liked it
     in the morning.
            Like you liked it
            at night.
   Yeah.
   Right and tight.
  Missed you.
              I missed you back.
You got
them bedroom eyes.
Like your man Biggie say,
they hypnotize.
             And like your man
             Tupac said,
          how do you want it?
                   Mm.
           Remember our first?
           We was in a club.
            You was looking
            too damn good.
          I had the chicken
          and waffle.
      - You had the ribs.
      - Yum, yum.
 Took you to the crib,
 showed you how I live.
 Got you some wine.
      Yeah.
    Beautiful time.
              Mm.
            You smell good.
      I know.
      Now what about peace?
           Shit, you the only
           piece I need.
           <i> ♫ Baby ♫</i>

             Both:
           <i> Oh, shit!</i>
 We done, yo.
           - Cyclops?
           - Oh!
- Oh!
        - That's my man.
        - What?
        We done.
     You know
     we wrong, right?
 - The fuck you mean we wrong?
 - Dead wrong.
I want my woman Indigo
more than I want a dead
yo Spartan purple.
    Not getting some
    because we out here
    acting dumb?
   I'd rather my Glock
   don't cock than my nuts
   stay numb.
  <i> Lysistrata took no pity.</i>
   Turned out every

   Global, really.
 Lysistrata:
<i> I asked Cyclops to be here.</i>
<i> You've been played for peace.</i>
     Cyclops:
    <i> This the 411.</i>
    <i> Listen to your queen, son.</i>
 I had time
 to reevaluate my shit.
Don't think I turned bitch,
but motherfuckers like us
in the life,
    we, too,
    need to strike.
    Put some change
    in our refrain
    and stop all of this
    killing pain.
Thus...

          Look, I'm over here
          putting in work.
           I got this.
           I'm about to win.
            We got this.
We...
                got nothing.
   Every Fortune 500 company
   has signed the peace accord
   ensuring that every person
   in the hoods of America
    of employment age
    is guaranteed a job.
        And I don't mean
    no minimum age neither.

          Lysistrata,
          this is what
      justice looks like.
 We will now sign
 the peace accord.
             Yeah.
          Peace is not
      the absence of war,
      but a newfound love
        for one another.
 Your johnsons brought
 you to the table,
       but that truce
       is unstable.
         <i> We need truth</i>

   We are the Mothers
   of the Hoods.
   All have lost someone
   to this senseless war.
   There will be
   no birthdays for them.
    No first dates.
  No walk down the aisles.
  No tomorrows.
         Why the fuck y'all got
         me on full blast?
     Why y'all trying
     to put me on Front Street?
           This is my Pam.
           She is 10 years old.
      - I don't want
        to hear that shit.
      - Chi! Please.
                One summer day
           back when we lived
           in the Cabrini-Green
           Projects,
           Pam was outside
           jumping double Dutch
     when they started shooting.
           She was shot
           through her left eye
           by a stray bullet.
              This was over
              20 years ago.
           And children dying
           from stray bullets
            wasn't a common
            occurrence like
            it is today.
        Days later, a young man
        came to my apartment
             and he begged
             my forgiveness.
             Then he confessed
             to the police.
             Back then
             it was a violation
             of the gang code
             to murder children.
                 He knew.
                  He knew
          if he didn't confess
          to me and the police,
           that the gangs
           would end his life.
              That man
              was your father.
                      Jamel.
   Never knew him.
Only heard stories.
Got killed in prison
when I was just a shorty.
            He tried
            to be a good man.
          You can be a good man.
             Be a good man.
             Be a good man.
                  Be a good man.
                  Be a good man.
                  Be a good man.
                  Be a good man.
               I did dirt.
  You got something
  you wanna say?
            I killed
            your baby Patti.
          God!
          It was an accident.
      God!
      God!
             <i> God!</i>
          Pray for me.
            Please.
     What y'all looking at?
          Time for you
        to do the same.
        Take the blame.
        Take the claim.
      Take it on the chin
     and confess your sins.
       Be a man and quit
       trying to suppress
       this pain you in.
        Hell of a mess,
       this gang you in.
       Sleepless nights.
       Too weak to fight.
       Couldn't reach us
       to teach us right.
      Our crying mothers.
      Our dying brothers.
      D and D, that's what
      they want us to be.
         Deaf and dumb.
   But you see, the only one
   we protecting is the gun.
      So run, nigga, run.
    I let it run out of me.
    'Cause I'm finally free
     from all these demons.
     Finally, they leaving.
    Finally, I'm breathing.
      So bring the truth.
        Bring the truth.
   Bring the truth, brother.
           Bring it.
  He'll be all right.
  Chi-Raq can take care
  of himself.
             That's Demetrius.
             It's not Chi-Raq.
    As Stevie Wonder sings,
      all in love is fair.
         Well, I ain't
      too sure about that,
          but for now
         I'll say yeah.
       Lysistrata formed
            an army
         more powerful
     than the Roman Empire.
    Burned through the city
  just like that Chicago fire.
          So remember
    queen prophet Lysistrata
        and the lessons
      that she taught you.
     The only real security
        is love, y'all.
            L-O-V-E.
       Let's all together
          make Chi-Raq
       back into Chicago,
            city of
      the broad shoulders.
             Peace.
          Two fingers.
            Wake up!
