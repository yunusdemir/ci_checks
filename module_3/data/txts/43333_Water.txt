<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quiet.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Open the door,
open the door.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What in the devil?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you please stand up
and take us to the cash drawer, ma'am?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I will not.
- We ain't asking.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no money
in the drawers yet.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's in the safe
and I ain't got the code.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Prove it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drawer!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Open the drawer.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I need the keys.
- Keys.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Step back.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit. Damn it!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Y'all are new at this,
I'm guessing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where's the money?
- I told you, it's in the safe.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Well, who has the code?
- Mr. Clauson.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He'll be here soon
and I suggest you fellers don't be.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All you're guilty of right now
is being stupid.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just leave and that's all it'll be.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me I'm stupid again.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What time does Mr. Clauson get here?
Ma'am, look at me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What time does
Mr. Clauson get here, huh?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">8:30 every morning.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're walking.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And sit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where do you think you're going?
Sit on the floor!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're stupid.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This ain't about you, darling.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Elsie, you all right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good morning.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't have to hit him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Slow down.
- I ain't speeding.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See, little brother,
not a worry in the world.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Planning this and doing it
is two different things.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe we should get there ahead,
get up to Olney.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Early bird gets the worm.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Slow down.
- I ain't speeding.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I found these coins
in the barn.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lord knows how long
they've been sitting there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been living off an inmate's diet,
and had all these coins</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">sitting right underneath
a bunch of feed sacks.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- This one says 1953.
- 1953?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wonder if any of these
is collector's items.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You could be sitting
on a fortune here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hope so.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good morning, folks.
Open the drawer!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Open the motherfucking drawer!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ones, 5s, 10s, 20s,
no hundreds, no bundles.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You boys robbing the bank?
- Shut up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put your hands on the counter.
On the counter.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes, sir.
- That's it, come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's crazy.
Y'all ain't even Mexicans.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh-uh, uh-uh.
No bundles.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just loose cash.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay-</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You ought to be
ashamed of yourselves.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hands on the counter
where I can see them!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got a gun on you, old man?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're damn right
I got a gun on me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you gonna get his gun?
- Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep up with
the circumstances, okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah, I got it.
- So are y'all gonna steal my gun, too?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have my own gun.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We ain't stealing from you.
We're stealing from the bank.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Much obliged.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry about this, folks.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dirty, rotten sons of bitches.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck you, old man!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, run, go!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put the gun on the counter?
You trying to get us killed?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I ain't stealing
from some old man.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're stealing
from one place, that's it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're turning out to be
a poor-ass criminal.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, fuck you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoo!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See what the early bird gets?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe we should hit
that branch in Jayton?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, we ain't.
We hit those banks</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">first thing in the fucking morning,
when they're empty.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- When they're empty, God damn it!
- All right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the last time
I care to be shot at.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got to be smart.
We're a ways from being finished.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit, I can do this all week.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're like the Comanches,
little brother,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">raiding wherever we please</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with the whole of Texas
hunting our shadow.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lord of the Plains.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hands off.
- Fuck off!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You hear about these bank robberies?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you always
dressed like me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is our uniform.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We ain't got no uniform.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can wear whatever
color shirt you choose.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just keep choosing mine.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ranger regs say white,
blue, or tan dress shirts.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stands to reason every once in a while
we're gonna be dressed the same.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you know what they say
about imitation, Alberto.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanna hear
about these bank robberies,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or you'll just sit there
and let Alzheimer's run its course?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are they at?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Texas Midlands--</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the branch in Archer City
and the branch in Olney.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">FBI want an assist?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Midlands ain't got
any branches outside Texas.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Plus, they're just hitting the drawers
for a few thousand.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">FBI don't want it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You may get to have some fun</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">before they send you off
to the rocking chair yet.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need you sober.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who the hell gets drunk
off a beer?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Place looks like shit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got anything else
you wanna say?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's not a decent steak</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the whole lot
of them sorry sons of bitches.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well,
while you were busy in jail,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was busy looking after Mama,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so you can go fuck yourself.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was she in that bed awhile?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3 months.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The end there was pretty rough.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could've helped out a little
if she asked.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could've fed
them skinny cows.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We had nothing to feed them.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I could've helped clean up
the house a bit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never took you for the go-to guy
for house cleaning.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Just robbing banks.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck her.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She never wanted nothing
to do with me anyway.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She leave a will?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Am I in it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The will don't matter.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She left everything to me.
By Friday it all goes to my boys.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She didn't mean nothing by it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She damn sure meant it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She always hated me
for standing up to him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We all got punished.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You never understood that fighting back
makes the beating last longer.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I understood.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why I stopped fighting
and shot that son of a bitch.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, what's going on?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Somebody robbed
the bank this morning.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do what?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you see anyone
looking a little sideways,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">give me a call.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sideways don't wanna meet me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Find itself on the wrong end
of a short rope.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, well, that would simplify things
for everyone but you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe,
if you can find the tree.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, I love West Texas.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ranger.
- Hi there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wasn't much of a robbery.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got off with just under $7,000.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Took the drawer money,
20s and under, only loose bills.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No ink pack?
- Nope.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Smart.
- That was smart.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can we get a look
at the video?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me introduce you
to the bank manager, Mr. Clauson.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This here is Ranger Hamilton.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ranger.
- Sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can we get a look
at the surveillance video?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got cameras, but they're
switching us over to a digital system</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that feeds into the computer.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These new cameras
don't hook to our VCRs.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Call over
the Young County Sheriffs.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ask them if they thought
to hook their cameras</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to some sort of
recording device.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Armed?
- Yes, sir. Pistols.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Faces covered?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ski masks, sweatshirts,
baggy pants...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Uh-huh.
- Like them thugs in Dallas.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tweakers, maybe?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A little early in the morning
for tweakers.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tweakers don't sleep.
They just tweak.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They rob drug stores
and parked cars, not banks.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I take a look inside?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I'm here, Margaret.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So they bopped you
in the snozzola, huh?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not very nice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know their faces was covered,
but could you tell their race?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Black, white?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Their skin or their souls?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's leave their souls
out of this for now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">White.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From around here somewhere
is my guess,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you know, from their voices.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Young County says same deal
with the branch in Olney.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do they have video?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Same deal all the way around.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doesn't Walmart sell all sorts
of electronic equipment?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My word.
Get your hands off that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, these boys, they aren't done yet,
I'll tell you that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How come?
- Well, they're patient.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're just sticking to the drawers,
not taking the hundreds.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the bank's money.
We can trace that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're trying to raise
a certain amount.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's my guess.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's gonna take
a few banks to get there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your boys know how rich
they're gonna be?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They don't know anything yet.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You take them to the funeral?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like I said,
they don't know anything.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When's the last time
you saw them?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When we all went to the rodeo
in Stamford right after you got out.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That was a year ago.
- I talk to them on the phone.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You talk to them on the phone?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You want a little advice?
- No. No, I don't.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go see them tomorrow.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got any idea how much
I owe Debbie in child support?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've got enough in your front pocket
to fix that problem right now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can't spare it,
you know that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe we should hit
another branch.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, you talk like
we ain't gonna get away with this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've never met nobody who got away
with anything, ever.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then why in the hell
did you agree to do it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because you asked,
little brother.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got to shit like an old goat.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grab the check,
meet me out front.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, if that isn't a hint,
I don't know what is.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You like your steak?
- Yes, ma'am.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you've got
a ways to go yet.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you'll be waiting around all day
for me to finish this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be here whether
you finish it or not, so...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you take your time.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure is quiet in here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Open the drawer.
5s, 10s, 20s.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fan them out
like a deck of cards.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you do?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Last job was for a...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">natural gas company.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sounds high-dollar.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, there ain't nothing
high-dollar about drilling.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one seems to be
drilling for gas now, anyway.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're sure drilling for oil.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, ain't one drill
the same as the next?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's my take on it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guess I got to get
someone else to believe me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Son of a bitch!</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We could use a cook.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just a thought.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Order's up, Jenny Ann.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bye.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Start the car!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck! Shit!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, go, go!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I bet you don't owe this much
in child support.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I must be out of my goddamn mind
to ask you for help.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanna get us killed?!
Huh?!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not a Midlands Branch.
That's not part of the plan.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, we got to go back to the ranch
and bury the car.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Fuck!
- No, we do not.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're over halfway to Oklahoma.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not driving a stolen getaway car
to a fucking Indian casino.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just put us
a goddamn day behind.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I got us a day ahead
this morning, so I guess we're even.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're welcome.
- Fuck you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't you answer
your own phone?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm driving. You're just sitting there
twiddling your fat fingers.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ranger Hamilton's phone.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's reckless is what it is.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's tweakers, I'm telling you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think these boys
is reckless.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn sure ain't tweakers.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They know exactly
what they're doing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know how you're gonna survive
without somebody to outsmart.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need a hobby, and quick.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about a horse?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mary Beth was the rider.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A horse would only
remind me of her.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You like to fish.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not enough to do it
every goddamn day.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, when I retire,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna move Esme and me
down to Galveston.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Buy a fishing boat.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gonna live on that son of a bitch
right at the pier.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, who knows?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe one of these bank robbers
is gonna want a gunfight</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I can dodge my retirement
in a blaze of glory.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I've seen you shoot.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There won't be much glory in it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, well, I'm lucky</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got a half-breed by my side
to avenge me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you can stay sober
long enough,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">knowing how you lnjuns
like the bottle.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What you all doing?
You burning this field?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why in the shit
would we do that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This kicked up on the highway,
been chasing us ever since.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wish we could do
something for you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ought to just let it turn me to ashes,
put me out of my misery.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cut that fence.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">21st century, I'm racing a fire
to the river with a herd of cattle.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I wonder why my kids
won't do this shit for a living.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move 'em out.
Come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, go! go-</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanna call it in?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, it's gonna burn out
when it hits the Brazos.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one to call
around here, anyway.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, these boys is on their own.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I still don't see the problem, Toby.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You still don't...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, the problem is,
thanks to you,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we have to spend tomorrow morning
getting another car,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so we'll have to hit two banks
on Wednesday.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We already done three today.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop worrying.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whose land is this?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jeremy Chalker.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He lets me stay here in exchange
for shooting coyotes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cold beer in the fridge.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You stole my hat.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I borrowed it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the fuck you do to it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's this?
- My livelihood.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't need all this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't keep the guns
in the trailer days on end.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not coming with us
in the bank.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just spoke to the teller.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's a little shook up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perp took her driver's license,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">threatened her family
if she talked to us.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mind if I ask you
your name, young lady?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Natalie Martinez.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, Natalie,
I want you to know</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we're gonna have some officers
watching your house extra careful</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">till we catch these buggers.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have my word on that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's more than one?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only one man robbed the bank?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- What'd he look like?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was dressed like a cowpoke
except for the ski mask.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think he ran to a car
that was parked out front of the diner.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You saw the car?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was green.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How old?
- I don't know cars, mister.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, was it a nice car,
an okay car,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or a real piece of shit?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was a real piece of shit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.
Now, we're getting somewhere.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, that looks like a man
who could foreclose on a house.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me, Natalie.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me, Mr. Banker.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Natalie, I'm gonna have the officer
stay with you till your father arrives.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- All right?
- Okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Didn't happen to have your surveillance
cameras on this morning, did you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, so you have
the robbery on video.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course we do.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What kind of bank would we be
if we didn't have video surveillance?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you'd be
a Texas Midlands Bank.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, we've got video.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Care to give it a watch
while I wander over to the burger joint?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you order me something
while you're there?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm starving.
- I doubt they serve pemmican.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know
I'm part Mexican, too.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well,
I'm gonna get to that</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when I'm through
with the Indian insults,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but it's gonna be a while.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You rangers are an odd bunch.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, just him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's take a look at that video.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, it's right back here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Howdy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ma'am.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guess you know about
the goings-on at the bank.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did notice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Any out-of-towners
come through today?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jenny Ann waited on a couple of boys,
ain't from here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll go get her.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Appreciate that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boys.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Y'all been here for a while?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, long enough to watch
a bank getting robbed</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that's been robbing me
for 30 years.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you say you've seen them?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm pretty sure they were sitting
right over there having lunch.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One of them was tall.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The other one was short.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They's both lean like cowboys.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looked like brothers
if you ask me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You the Texas Ranger?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, ma'am.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me about those handsome
young strangers that you waited on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who said handsome?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Based on the fact that you didn't
meet me in the parking lot,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">hollering about
the two out-of-towners</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">eating here
right before a bank robbery.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, they didn't mention
they was robbing the bank.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They paid cash?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That a crime now?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How much did they leave?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How much?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">$200.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And they left it before
the bank was robbed, so...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, before this bank
was robbed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna need
to see them bills.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ma'am.
- Mm-mm.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ma'am, them bills is evidence.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mm-mm, it's evidence
if they're the bank robbers.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Till then, it's my tip.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And half my mortgage.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you go out there
and you get a warrant,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you come after the money</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that I will be using to keep a roof
over my daughter's head.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One man hit the bank,
just like she said.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- Checkered button-down shirt,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">jeans, ski mask.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's all the video will tell us.
- Yep. Yep.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Checkered shirt.
That is him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They were sitting right over there.
Tipped her $200.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go wrestle a description</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from that big sassy girl
in the kitchen.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't get it yourself?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, and get that tip from her.
We're gonna check them bills.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good luck.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I'd expect some resistance.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, and, Alberto,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">call that motel on 287,
get us a room.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna stay the night?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, this is where the action is.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seems foolish.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The days of robbing banks
and trying to live to spend the money...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they're long gone.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Long gone for sure.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What does Justin want to do
when he's grown?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right now he's dreaming
of slinging a football for A&M.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a lot like you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I bet that puckers your red eye.
- More than you know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">39 years of life, 10 in jail.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If he turn left where I turned right,
he'll be okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let the world call me a fool</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Things are right with me and you</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yaw.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yaw.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want anything?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dr. Pepper, Winston Lights.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.
Come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What, bitch?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You looking for trouble,
motherfucker?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You came to the right place.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boy, you'd think
there were 10 of me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not so fucking tough now,
are you, bitch?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, man, he had it coming.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He had it coming.
He had it coming.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got some spunk left in you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you remembered the gun.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're getting
to be old hat at this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Asshole could've killed you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, not the way it would
have gone, little brother.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">10 of me, I told you!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you trying to make me mad?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said Dr. Pepper.
This is Mr. Pibb.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's all they had.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only assholes drink Mr. Pibb.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drink up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now we're talking.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The women in this place.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>What the hell you talking about?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We should get another shot.
They'll be pretty soon enough.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bartender,
whiskeys if you please.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Coming up-</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To your boys.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go change that money.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry.
I just sold my car.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is how the fella paid me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We take it any way
you bring it, mister.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wanna play some poker?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't gamble.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't lose at poker,
not even you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna watch the Aggie game
and have a beer.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, suit yourself.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Suck a D.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't lose it all.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Eat my A!</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fucking asshole.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's, uh--
that's quite a stack.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Check?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't chase me, chief.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You Comanche?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lords of the Plains.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lords of Nothing now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I call.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Show your cards, gentlemen.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know
what Comanche means?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It means enemies forever.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Enemies with who?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what that makes me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An enemy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It makes me a Comanche.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does he look like you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see his mom in him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody else sees me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You staying in the hotel?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take me to your room.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.
Just, uh...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no shame
in needing the touch of a woman.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you do.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just let me touch you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trying to work my little brother?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, I wasn't doing anything, but I...
- Tanner, she didn't do nothin'.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- She didn't do nothin'.
- But, but, but, but, but...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You saw there was
a stack of chips here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Don't.
- Easy mark?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Uh... no.
- What were you gonna do?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bring him up to his room,
call your pimp,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- roll him, drug him, what?
- No. I...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What were you gonna do?
- Tanner, no.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mind if I sample the goods?
Real fuckin'...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hands off. Stop it.
Stop it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're fucking crazy!
- Call me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We got a problem here?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's all good.
- It's all good.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all good.
Just got a little drunk at the bar.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry about that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How the fuck have you managed
to stay out of prison for a year?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's been difficult.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like to pay this out
in cash or check?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get some Debbie money.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">4 in cash, rest in check.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who would you like
the check made out to?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Texas Midlands Bank.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you much.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go get a room.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome to the Comanche 66.
Do you have a reservation?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We do not.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good Lord, look at you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We would be obliged if you
would provide accommodations,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">though we failed to call ahead.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boy, you are trouble.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm the worst kind, darling.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In your last days in the nursing home,
you'll think of me and giggle.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Why, God?
Why won't you answer my prayers?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You begged him for help,</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and yet you look around at your life
and nothing is different.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And so you assume
that God has told you no.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God doesn't say no.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why couldn't we drive back
to Lubbock?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause they ain't robbing banks
in Lubbock.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not gonna watch this,
are we?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ain't you Christian?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but I ain't stupid.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God doesn't talk through this man
any more than he talks through my dog.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, then maybe you should
give your dog a listen.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ain't you Indian?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're supposed to be
burning sage</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and dancing around the bed,
whooping like a bee stung you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Catholic.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, I'd rather dance
around the fire with a spear.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd rather have you stab me
with a spear than watch this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This son of a bitch,
he wouldn't know God</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if he crawled up his pant leg
and bit him on the pecker.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Change the damn channel.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, this, this is
what God watches right here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry, they're gonna have
soccer highlights on soon enough.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's for your Mexican half.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, look at this boy run.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Longhorns are gonna have
a good team this year.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That soccer,
never could understand that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anything a 5-year-old can do
ain't a sport.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who invented it? Aztecs?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kickin' around skulls
or something, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sounds like a Comanche sport.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, in 3 weeks,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you can watch whatever
you want on TV all day.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hell, you can do it right now
in your own room.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, where's the fun in that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what, Alberto?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In a year's time,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's my teasing
that you're gonna miss.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's what you'll laugh about</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when you stand over my grave
and wish me well.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, I hope that's tomorrow.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, that was a good one.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll get the hang of this yet.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Isn't it getting late for you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, it is.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, heavens above.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heavens above.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at those titties.
Are you fucking kidding me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>What are you doing?</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sleeping on the porch,
practicing my future.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a dangerous thing
we do for a living.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're lucky...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">having seen it through
to the end.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hope I'm that lucky.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, well.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Without me by your side,
I doubt you'll get close enough</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to a criminal to ever be
in danger again.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just when I was starting
to feel sorry for you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Indians ain't supposed
to feel sorry for cowboys.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the other way around.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And this makes you the executor?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Mm-hmm.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, no matter what they charge us with,
they can't take it away?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no way to trace funds
from a casino, all right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Once you get the checks to the bank,
trust is untouchable.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't tell
nobody nothing, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, what is there to tell?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, you boys won
that money gambling, didn't you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">$32,000 pays off
the reverse mortgage.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And those bastards paid
the property tax from 2012 to now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's another $11,000.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, $43,000
and you are free and clear.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just have the loan officer
fax me a release of lien,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I'll get that over
to the lease manager at Chevron.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The fax number is on the card.
- Okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How much you making
on this deal?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not near as much as I'm risking.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why you doin' it, then?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, they loaned
the least they could.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just enough to keep your mama poor
on a guaranteed return.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thought they could swipe
her land for $25,000.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's just so arrogant,
it makes my teeth hurt.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To see you boys...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">pay those bastards back
with their own money?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, if that ain't Texan,
I don't know what is.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, they can foreclose
on Friday.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come hell or high water,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">be at the bank in Childress
on Thursday.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Knowing them fuckers,
they will close early.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We'll be there.
- Oh, and, Toby.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The trust needs to be managed
by a bank.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You really wanna cover
your tracks?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You get Texas Midland
to handle this trust.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what's the plan?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna watch that bank
like a deer feeder.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In time, we'll be right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, let's see
what they got to eat here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Howdy, ma'am.
How you doing today?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hot, and I don't mean
the good kind.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what don't you want?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pardon?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What don't you want?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, well, uh,
I think I'll just, uh...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I've been working here
for 44 years.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ain't nobody
ever ordered nothing</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but T-bone steak
and a baked potato.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Except this one asshole
from New York</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">tried to order trout
back in 1987.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't sell
no goddamned trout.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">T-bone steaks.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, either you don't want
the corn on the cob,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or you don't want
the green beans.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what don't you want?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want green beans.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want green beans either.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Steaks cooked medium rare.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Can I get my steak cooked...
- That weren't no question.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Iced tea for you boys.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Iced tea would be great.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Iced tea, yep.
Thank you, ma'am.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Uh-huh.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'll tell you one thing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nobody's gonna rob
this son of a bitch.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My word.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How's she feel?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She runs good.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ain't gonna win any races.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got New Mexico plates.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She got a top?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How she came.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll take her.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't report it stolen till Friday.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The guy from Chevron
is dropping off the lease agreement.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you okay dealing with that
by yourself?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay being with Debbie
by yourself?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember,
he ain't the enemy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just take the papers,
say thank you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The oil man is the enemy,
make no mistake.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He just ain't ours.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be back to the ranch by dark.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will be waiting.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drive like a schoolteacher
with all this shit in the back.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure feels like beer o'clock.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ask and you shall receive.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Come in.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mama died.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A few weeks ago.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, good riddance.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No offense.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here's the money I owe you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess you'll be selling
the ranch.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It goes to the boys.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Really?
- Mmm.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's been put in a trust.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that mean?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It means no one can sell it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something else
I got to take care of.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's your brother?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Friend's house, I guess.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How come you ain't in school?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">School don't start yet.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just 2-a-days
for football right now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your grandmother died.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm giving the ranch
to you and your brother.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember going out there
when you was little?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What am I supposed to do
with a ranch?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anything but sell it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We found oil on it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You and your brother ain't gonna
have to worry about money no more.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you may be hearing
a lot of things about me and...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">your uncle.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't be like us.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You hear me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever I hear,
I won't believe.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you believe it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did all of it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, you, you do it different.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ain't gonna drink it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You tell me not to be like you,
and then you offer me a beer.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which is it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good boy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How are the boys?
- What are you doin'?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Insurance.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want that shit in the car.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll be running two cars
next time, brother.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They'll ride with me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, this is your plan?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're just gonna sit here</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and see if this is the branch
they rob next.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What would you rather do?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanna drive 80 miles
back to Olney</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and look for more fingerprints
that we ain't gonna find?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or you wanna drive 200 miles
back to Lubbock</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and look at mugshots that don't matter
'cause nobody knows</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what these sons of bitches
look like?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or we can just wait here
for them to rob this bank,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which is the one thing I'm pretty
damn sure they are going to do.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know what you're doing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're trying to make this last
as long as you can</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because the longer it lasts,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the farther you are
from that front porch.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I'm waitin' for these boys
to make a mistake.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So far they ain't, but they will.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And they're gonna make it here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, just relax.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Enjoy this little town.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you wanna live here?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got an old hardware store</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that charges twice
what Home Depot does,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">one restaurant with
a rattlesnake for a waitress.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, how is anybody
supposed to make a living here?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People have made a living here
for 150 years.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, people lived in caves
for 150,000 years,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but they don't do it no more.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, maybe your people did.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your people did, too.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A long time ago,
your ancestors was the Indians...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">till someone came along
and killed them,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">broke 'em down,
made you into one of them.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">150 years ago, all this
was my ancestors' land.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything you can see.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything you saw yesterday.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Till the grandparents
of these folks took it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now, it's been taken
from them.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Except it ain't no army doing it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's those sons of bitches
right there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You thinking about tomorrow?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ain't you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The little hotel clerk.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why is it always the sweet ones</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that are such devils
when you get them revved up?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wouldn't know.
Never had a sweet one.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you like them pissed off,
lookin' for someone to blame.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure seems that way.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a good thing you're doing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're doing it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go easy on the bank teller
tomorrow.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be as gentle
as a young nurse.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You coming?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On my way-</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Morning.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want some breakfast?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, breakfast sounds good.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So we hit the Jayton branch first,
then Coleman, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, that should get us
what we need.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's do this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ugh... shit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not part of the fucking plan.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The bastards closed down
the branch.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What now, little brother?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Coleman.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What the hell you doing?
- We gotta head to Post.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What the hell are you doing?
- Get...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We got to head to Post.
- What are you talking about?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got to head to Post.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going to Coleman.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's only one teller in Coleman.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever we get won't be enough.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We go to Coleman right now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If that ain't enough,
we head to Post.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we don't leave now for Post,
we won't get there till noon.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't wanna rob a bank
at lunchtime, do you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, we don't know the patterns
of folks out there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The patterns
are the same everywhere.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All these towns are dead.
Post ain't no different.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a bigger bank.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We'll leave your car
just out of town.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Come on, now.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I got this figured.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First two banks,
they were Texas Midland Banks.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, there are
7 branches altogether.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The main branch is in Fort Worth.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're not gonna mess with that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, they hit
the branch in Olney.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They hit the one in Archer City.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Then there's the one here.
- Which they did not hit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alberto, will you please
follow me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't let... just keep
your mouth shut</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and just listen
to what I'm gonna say.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's the one here...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then there's the one
in Childress.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's the one in Jayton.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That one's closed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know that one's closed!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know that one's closed,
Alberto.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's my point.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jayton is closed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That just leaves Post.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're not gonna mess
with the bank in Childress.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a fairly
decent-sized town.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The branch in Vernon
wasn't Midlands and they hit that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, one of them did.
Alone.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then he ran all the way
across the road to get to the car.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think his partner had no idea
that was gonna happen.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What does that mean to us?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It means that the only branch
that fits the bill is in Post.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, then let's go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The town looks busy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Little bit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My word.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's too big.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what she said.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's no good.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aw, this ain't your first rodeo.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bigger bank...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">more money.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody,
get on the fucking ground!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get on the fucking ground!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Young ladies, get on
the fucking ground! Now!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, down!
On the ground! Now!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you very much.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tellers, stand up!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Open the drawers!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get down!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take 3 steps back!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Open the fucking drawer,
young lady!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you deaf and dumb?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said open
the motherfucking drawer!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You, down!
- All right. Oh, please.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Now step back!</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very good.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone's paying attention.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now get on
your motherfucking knees!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay down!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, hey, let's go!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Call 911!</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus fucking Christ.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The whole goddamn town
is shooting at us.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get in the back.
Get in the fucking back.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, let's go!
Get in the car!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't let them get away!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How you doing back there,
little brother?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You fucking killed them.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These concealed carry permits</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">sure complicate
a bank robbery, don't they?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not my fault it was payday.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This has gone too far, Tan.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one was supposed
to fucking die.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was them or us.
Take your pick.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, go, Margaret.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Texas Midlands in Post
has just been hit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah! What did I tell you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah!
- Locals are in chase.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Suspects escaping west</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in an old Bronco.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, Margaret, keep us posted.
We're on our way there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me an Indian whoop.
Come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These boys are gonna go down.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's get some giddy-up music
going on there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, please, not that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, hey. Come on.
Snap out of it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Snap the fuck out of it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit, let me see that.
You're hit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boy, you're hit.
Get the back.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you'll live.
It's a through and through.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Compress it. Wrap it up.
You got to wrap it up tight.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Front and back,
front and back.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wrap it tight.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, brother, hear me now,
hear me clear.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unless you wanna be a black mark
on your sons' lives,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need you mountain lion mean.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You hear me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hear you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mountain lion mean.
- Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hold on.
- Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here, take the money.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let's go.
- Get to the casino.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Change the money
like we planned.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This was your plan,
and it worked.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every step of the way.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trust it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are you headed?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't be stupid.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you, Toby.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you, too.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Tobe, go fuck yourself.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go fuck yourself.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As I walked out
one sunny morning</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I spied a young cowboy
a loping along</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His hat was laid back</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His spurs were a jinglin'</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And as he come near me
He's singing this song</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yippee hiyiyo.
You little doggies.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's your misfortune
and none of my own</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is what they call
white man's intuition.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes a blind pig
finds a truffle.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's your misfortune
and none of my own</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Back up! Oh, shit!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go! Move!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My word.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, We're gonna need
a SWAT unit up here</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and a helo to pin
these boys down.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Suspect is a white male.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Guys, spread it out!</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's got a rifle.
Get down!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He's on the ridge!
He's on the ridge!</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, I see him!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's just one?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yep, just one.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's supposed
to be two of them.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe the town folks got one.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, if they did,
they got the smart one.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This old boy
is out of his mind.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you slip up this canyon
and tomahawk that son of a bitch?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ranger down.
Call it in.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get back! Back!
Back those trucks up!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get back!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get these trucks back.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Back up!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Back them up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How well do you know the land
around here?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like the back of my hand.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, he's hid up
in that brush on that hill.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you get me up there
behind him?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me a half hour,
I'll have that bastard</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">field dressed on the hood
of my truck.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't let you do that.
You just get me there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's gonna be a 500-yard shot
if he's where you said.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just get me there!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How are you doing?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good. You?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are you headed?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ruidoso.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where you from?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hamlin.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Taking the scenic route?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Taking the only way I can.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They got the road closed
at Post.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everywhere you turn
they got the road closed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You got your license on you?
- Yes, I do.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait right there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sir.
- Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have a good day.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks much.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're pretty winded.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You oughta let me take the shot.
Hell, it's my gun.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not on your life.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's mine.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Just left of the tree.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lord of the Plains.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...definitely something
out of a dime-store novel.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Texas Highway Patrol
and the locals</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>chased the robbers
to this hillside behind me,</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>20 miles west of town,
where the gunfight continued.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And right now we do know</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Ranger Marcus Hamilton
killed one of the gunmen</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>using a rifle he actually borrowed
from a resident here.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We don't know the name
of that suspect yet...</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lucky guy-</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just in the nick of time, too.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are the odds?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, this, uh, satisfies</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">both the reverse mortgage loan
and the, uh...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the back taxes that we've paid
on your mother's behalf.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We do that as courtesy,
of course.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can fax the release of lien
to that number.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An attorney?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, well, I'll... I'll get that
faxed over to your attorney</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">by the end of the week.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is the end of the week.
I wanna watch you do it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it takes a little time
to prepare.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got all day.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here we go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. That's it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it's been a pleasure
doing business with you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me ask you a question.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do y'all manage trusts?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Marcus,
ain't you supposed to be retired?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Howdy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Shelley.
- Nice to see you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Well, hey, Marcus.
- Hey, Margaret.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Been awhile.
How's life as a civilian?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, just, you know...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Think I can take a peek
at Mr. Howard's file?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tanner Howard.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, come on.
I ain't got nothing better to do.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's at my desk.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Killed his father
in a hunting accident, huh?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'd love to know what he was hunting
in the barn in April.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">10 years in Huntsville
for aggravated assault.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cellmate was released in 2012.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Before that,
he served 7 years</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on bank robbery charges
up in Big Spring.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Been trying to track him down,
but no luck so far.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You all are off the brother?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's nothing that links him
to the robberies.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, what about
that little waitress in Vernon?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, we showed her photos.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She said she didn't
recognize him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pretty upset you took
her tips as evidence.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She sure was sassy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You show that
to that old timer?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Yep. He said he didn't look
like the fella from the diner.</i></font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He didn't recognize
Tanner's photo either.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, tried to get a court order
on his bank accounts and the ranch,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">DA wouldn't do it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Toby's got no record.
He's never been arrested.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His only court appearance
was at his divorce.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He don't fit the bill, Marcus.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People don't start out
robbing banks.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They graduate to it
like his asshole brother.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Besides,
when we was out there,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we saw two crews from Chevron</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">capping wells
and putting in pumpjacks.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Engineers out there
said they're gonna pull</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">2,000 barrels a month
off that place.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just try convincing a judge
to issue warrants on somebody</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">set to clear $50,000 a month</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for robbing $40,000 from the bank
that manages the family trust.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Midland manages the trust?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'd think they'd want
this thing figured out.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think the bank cares
about anything</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but keeping that trust
right where it is.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hell, they were less cooperative
than Toby's attorney.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marcus, he's not a suspect
and you are retired.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I hear you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You like my desk?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't hate it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I'll see you, Marcus.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Know who I am?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm the man
who killed your brother.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I also know you're retired
and you're trespassing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you could shoot me now
and be within your rights.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You toting a gun and all,
how convenient.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I figure you got one, too.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mind if I sit?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go ahead.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want a beer?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure.
I ain't on duty no more.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's nice out here
in this breeze, huh,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">now that it's cooled down.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did you do it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, never mind.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll figure that out in time.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?
Why did you do it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know why your brother,
Tanner, did it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He robbed them banks
because he liked it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He shot my partner 300 yards away
'cause he liked it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It made him feel good.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I hadn't blown
his shit for brains out,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there'd be a new truck out front
with jet skis</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or whatever else
he could think to buy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He'd spend it all just to give
an excuse to steal some more.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But not you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's nothing new
around here...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">except them pumpjacks.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Each one of them
making you a month</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what you and your brother stole
from all 4 banks combined.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help me understand, then.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help me understand
why 4 people died...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so you could steal money
that it don't seem you've spent,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that it don't seem you need.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got a family?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My partner had a family.
A big one.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They don't got no pumpjacks
in their backyard.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I didn't kill your friend.
- Yes, you did.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By setting this thing
in motion.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You expect me to believe
your dimwitted brother planned this?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no.
This was smart.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This was you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been poor my whole life.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So were my parents,
their parents before them.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like a disease...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">passing from generation to generation,
becomes a sickness.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what it is.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Infects every person you know...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but not my boys.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not anymore.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is theirs now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, I ain't never killed
no one in my life,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but if you want me to start with you,
let's get on with it, old man.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See if you can grab that pistol
before I blast you off this porch.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Howdy.
- What's going on?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The hogs are back
in the garden.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Feral hogs tearing up this place
something fierce.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's this?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm an old friend
of your husband.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ex-husband.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just working on the house.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you don't live here?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it's not mine.
It's theirs.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The things we do
for our kids, huh?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well...</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I best be going.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ma'am.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me, too, Debbie.
I'm gonna wash up,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">be back around 9:00 tomorrow
to finish the front.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Start painting the extension</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then help Randy
with his homework</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when he gets back
from school, okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay-</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I rent a little house in town.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you wanna stop by
and finish this conversation,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're welcome anytime.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I'd like that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be seeing you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.
Soon, I hope.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm ready to be done
with this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll never be done with it
no matter what.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's gonna haunt you, son,
for the rest of your days.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you won't be alone.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's gonna haunt me, too.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you stop by,
maybe I'll give you peace.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe.
Maybe I'll give it to you.</font>
