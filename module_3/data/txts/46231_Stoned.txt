second
it is exactly the opportunity that you looking for, okay
it's time to step up to the plate
there's girl out there, she needs your help
you could be her JFK
I know,she nice, she nice
but it's now's the worse time than ever to think about starting family
I mean, look at the middle east
and public schools, and the economy
I can't take her to Tuscan.
what the fuck are you talking about?
you don't start a family, you just taking here to work.
you destroy only a motive transportation
it's at least you can do
as a bonus
maybe you could (nava??)have her number
eh
-I can do that
-you can do that
so, uh, may
Megan
you?\
I'm Oliver
so do you live around here?
-yeah
I live in same apartment complex as your friend.
uhh, that explains the moped being parked there, uh?
it's a scooter.
right
so, what do you do for work?
I'm a Batista at (halls??) coffee
oh, that's sound's awesome
it's not!
and I already missed most of my shifts
you could harry up, that would be great.
oh, okay
lock it up, pedal to the metal
stop right there
-owie
it get a little a wide, it's a wide turn
what uh, what are you writing in there.
it's nothing
looks a lot of words
it's just something I'm working on
don't think you'd understand
oh, yeah, try me!
it's Veronica Mars and fiction
oh, yeah,yeah, that's a detective show
with girl form "forgetting sarah marshall"
what's it about?
well, in this one Veronica teams up with pchers
and they uncover murder mystery
and she fell in love with vivle
it's silly, but, I really like it
I can stand behind silly
so I just call you for my scooter?
-yeah
funny story about that, maybe
I should just get your number
some kinda of rough situation here
I just lost my phone earlier today, so
again, I'm really sorry and I promise to make it up to you
just don't screw me okay?
I'll try not to.
you know what time it is? late
that's what time it is
justice
dude, you better think twice before yell at my friend Megan here
dahh
it's my turn
she's a hard worker
she's early everyday and she stays late every night
she's your f'ing anchor
you need watch it, we've got families here
you know we had the highest sales of the year, last month
are you gonna ignore that
are you gonna ignore the quarterly reports?
you know what, if you fire her.
you're gonna have to fire me too.
I'm so sorry, I really thought that was gonna work.
if it's any help, I'm pretty sure I'm getting fired on Monday
how that would be any help?
I don't know how I'm going to pay my rent.
don't know how you're gonna fix my scooter.
scrat...???
yo, many dude?
what can I do for you?
-are you here for business?
oh I am not really ice cream vendor
sorry, that's a bit misleading
you sitting outside of ice cream truck.
why don't you guys selling?
yeah
why aren't we selling?
ice cream for sale.
push pop.
yeah, there you go.
right
you know, boo, we're there.
there you go, ms Patrick, you stay at school.
so, how do we do?
thinking about 98 dollars
so, five more days like this and
we should be able to repair my scooter
you know you're a pretty good ice cream salesman
do you need an assistant?
I would love an assistant
if this was my real job.
but it's not
um
I supposed to detail a car today.
and it got stolen
and I was like panicking and freaked out, so I stole this truck
I'm pretty sure the person who stole
my car
was the same guy driving this truck
does that makes sense?
so you're a screw-up and a thief
yeah, just like a little bit, though
oaky
why don't we team up anyway?
we can sell some ice cream and
I'll help you find the car
I mean you don't have to do that
I can just drop you at your house
no, honestly, that's the last place I wanna be right now
plus I've seen every episode of Veronica Mars
so I'm pretty well prepared
okay
okay
so you said the guy that stole your car, was driving this ice cream truck
yeah, I'm pretty sure
why don't we go to his house and paying a little visit
okay, that's fine and dandy, but, how do you know where he lives
oh this house matches the ice cream truck pretty well
yeah, I think we found the fit
Deven
uh, yes, sorry, we're
looking for devon, have you seen him?
I haven't seen him
he's six dated years
are you blind?
woow
that's my lady, you want come inside?
I have very sexually active imagination
you both come inside
yeah, I don't think we're gonna do that
can you just tell us where's devon is, please?
I'm not telling you anything unless, you do something
for me
alright, what do want from us?
oh god, I don't want anything from you boy
just the girl
uh
okay
[whispering] I would so like to squish your titty nipples
no

yeah, yeah, eveybody leave me alone before I flip the fuck out
alright, calm down there, you little whipper-snapper

a forth-grader on high-speed car chase

I'm in the middle of live-stream podcast

you scared me.
is everything okay up there, I heard noises
oy, everything's fine
what are you, snooping through my stuff for
yes, sorry
I just figured I am in a garage
in the middle of night with guy I never met
and watched all the Saw movies, so
what is that?
ooh
that's my smoking apparatus
it's taking me over 11 years to acquire
it's pretty beautiful, uh?
I wouldn't really know
[blows raspberry]
but
[blows]
are you telling me you're a hip chick?
who writes fan fiction
in a leather bound journal
that used to work at this coffee shop
has never smoke pot
I never smoked anything, okay?
I mean, I just didn't
ride with those type of social circles, you know.
uh
what's it like?
[coughs]
I'll give you a crash course
oh, hi there
this is a bud of marijuana
for centuries mankind has worked
to create purest strains with the most
vivid highs
now although there's at least complex
joints probably most iconic smoking method
without getting even burn you gotta break up the bud
and to do that, I'd like to use
a grinder
now, before I was old enough to buy bulnsir???
papers I was using a couple low tech method
apples are the tasty way to smoke
but it could be awkward
as alternative, some kid smoking out of cans
then we have our glassware
the cornerstone in every smokers collection
the possibilities are endless
this includes
bongs
and, uh, ooh
pipes
and, um, uh
bubblers
um, what's a bubbler?
that's very good question.
it's bong pipe hydrator.
very effective
just don't rest it on his side
with most glass pieces you have to work the carburetor
this little hole let's you expire an oxygen
to get just a perfect amount of burn
if you looking to biggest height of weed conservation ratio
the waterfall method worth to gander
perfect suction
then we get our high tech stuff
like a vaporizer
it vaporize the pot so breath pure THC
quick high, no smoke
wow
you know a lot about stuff.
so you think you wanna try some?
uh, it's tempting
but no I'm good
c'mon, don't you do something about wanting to go on an adventure
and try new things
yeah, but
but, this is the opportunity to try something new
c'mon pick a piece
well, the bubbler was kinda cute.
-alright, you ready
-um
just breathe in
alright, now hold in
and exhale
[coughs] oh, man
the taste's weird
you're feeling it yet?
I heard it doesn't work the first time
oh, you're wrong girl
we want you at biggerday
you can get out ever
stuck here for life
it's true
gotta go with that
did you see that?
this was a unique experience for Veronica
an agent of danger
a mistress of mayhem
she's a bad bitch
can't mess with her
what if? need blue pen
is you blue eyes
oh yeah
it is so amazing
you thought to be professional, like a
professional guitar player
had she ever been in love
it's female a fanciable fiction
has she?
we don't know?
oh wait
I got something
you're gonna flip the shit over
wait
wait, wait, wait,
we've forgotten about our internet research
strawberry
amazing
it's funny how it takes only one event for the world to change
Pearl Harbor, the San Francisco earthquake
and canceling bob sponge square pants
it's only altered the course of human history
this may sound disastrous
but as we saw all with Oliver and Megan
the greatest adversities
can lead to new opportunities
good morning
oh, moring
you sleep like a bear
I don't mean a hibernating one
you make all sorta growly noises
what happened last night
we climbed the Himalaya's, made out
watched "Donald Duck mathland"
you drew this picture of us
you did must of work but I did sharpie on the boobies
so what? John G
raped and murdered my
wife on my chest
that was me, I did really like the movie "memento"
but, it was really hard to write backwards
so I just went for the standard variation
okay, where are my cloths and why does it smell weird in here?
oh, yeah
you decided to take all cloths off
and rub icey huddle??? of your body
you're passed out truly there after
oh my god
did we had sex?
no
wait
was that an option?
remind me to never smoke weed ever again
noted

yeah
so funny, I
have all these fiends that are getting marred and having babies
but I was with Billy for 7 years
never thought I would settle down with him
should have broken up with him a log time ago
this whole thing pretty much my fault
hey
screw that guy, I mean at least you broke it off before it was to late
can you imagine making that decision
after you had a mini-Megan
like my parents
you know what? Oliver

thanks
doughnut?
oh that's my favorite
ooh, alright you can have it. that's fine

and I think there would be a super cute on a wine cellar
wait, which one is that?
the cute little breadhead form yoga with herpes

make it like cool dark cave, with moodlights
I just think it's completely sad and dull as it is
reminds me of work
what do you say we jump into the pool
I'm laying out
you can't take break from chair for a second and jump in the pool?
I can't get my hair wet
