<i>No one is illegal!</i>
This is Irina story. Not mine.
She simply brushed my life.
I'm a defense attorney. I fight
for the rights of the accused.
Whether they're innocent or guilty
it's not something I need to know.
What matters is the motivation
behind a crime.
Often has to do with our concept of
happiness. We all want to be happy.
Basically we all want two things.
Avoid pain and to be happy.
Shit!
Are you all right?
- Is okay.
- Everything alright? Are you okay?
We'd better call an ambulance,
don't you thing? Or the police?
No, is okay. Don't.
- Wait. Are you sure you're okay?
- Yes, all okay.
- I think better call the police.
- No, please.
Then at least tell me your name and
how I can reach you.
Wait!
Or get in touch with me
if there's a problem.
If you don't feel okay.
My address is on here.
Promise?
That was the first time
our paths crossed.
We were both fortunate.
As a criminal defense attorney
I'm a specialist
in pursuit of happiness
and those moments
when happiness deserts us.
Those moments
that change our lives forever.
An accident, a mishap.
When we hurt someone
or possibly even kill them.
Everything we do to find
that happiness,
to keep or protect it.
Sometimes we don't even realize
that we have it when we do.
Happiness.

Spare any small change?
Any spare change?

Is it for me?
- Hey, stop it!
- Just a little until you're warm.
But you must wash.
You stink more than dog.
- My dog doesn't stink, okay?
- Stinks.
I may stink a little.
Stink like beer. Wash yourself.
Wash yourself.
Wash!
You stink too.
But good.
Thanks.
Can I use your hair gel?
Yes. And brush teeth.
Or soon they fall out.
Good night. Sleep tight.
Where will you sleep?
I don't know yet. Somewhere.
Look. All my treasures.
I found them all.
Don't give him sausage.
He's a vegetarian.
What?
Vegetarian! He doesn't eat meat.
Doesn't eat meat? Is nonsense.
He's dog. Eats meat.
No, Byron doesn't eat meat.
Byron, come here.
Spit it out!
See. Eats meat.
- And here comes the whoop-di-doo.
- What?
The whoop-di-doo. You know
what I mean?
No.
The moment you can't go any higher,
everything stops and it's good.
- Know what I mean now?
- Yes.
How is it called?
- Whoop-di-doo.
- Whoop-di-doo.
- Have it?
- No.
Now?
Yes! Again! Again! Whoop-di-doo!
Let me down!
- Get that dog out of this park!
- Let me down!
Don't you have
anything better to do?
This is only for children.
- Let me down!
- Unbelievable.
- Let me down!
- I said now!
Hey, wait up!
Wait! What's the matter?
Don't have papers.
They will send me back.
- What? Nobody'll send you back.
- Yes. Police send me back.
Bullshit. I won't let them.
Nobody's sending you back.
- Back where anyway?
- You have no idea. You are baby.
- Hey...
- Leave me alone!
Leave me alone!
Go away! Okay?
Come on.
Byron, come here.
Sorry.
Sleep tight.
Thank you.
Are you sleeping here?
Yeah, I have a good blanket.
May I have a newspaper?
- A newspaper?
- Yes.
- It'll go on your bill. Okay?
- What?
- It'll go on your bill.
- Oh, no. Thank you. Bye.
At home we have 250 sheep.
Sometimes I take
sheep babies in my bed.
- You mean lambs.
- What?
Baby sheep are called lambs.
Lambs.
- Lambs.
- Many people eat.
Me no. Lambs... no... never.
We had it at Easter. Roast lamb.
- No.
- Sure.
My grandma use to make it.
When I was small. We ate lamb.
- Tasted great back then.
- No.
Sure. It was good.
After my grandma died,
that was never any lamb.
My mother never cooked.
I made myself spaghetti every day.
Spaghetti with zilch.
Zilch?
- Yeah.
- What's that?
The famous zilch sauce.
Never had it?
- Zilch?
- Zilch.
I'll make it for you.
Goes with everything.
What did you eat at home?
Burek with meat.
My mother cooked.
And your father?
Do you have a father, too?
Like who's there?
Who lives with you?
One who lives with you
in the same house?
Where are you from?
Far away.
And you?
From here. Still far away though.
As far as the moon.
Why'd you leave home?
Why are you hustling here?
Why do you do what you do?
Me? I don't do a thing.
You are beggar.
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.
I'm not. A beggar is a bum. Okay?
You are beggar.
I am not.
Are! Why?
I am Irina.
Irina.
Kalle.
Irina.
I need a beer.
Have any spare change?
Got any spare change?
Have any spare change?
Have any spare change maybe?
Spare change?
Got any spare change for me?
Any spare change maybe?
- Got any spare change?
- Piss off!
Have a nice day, office bitch!
Listen, you little asshole.
I was a punk 30 years ago.
I saw The Clash in London in '78.
I had a safety pin in my ear
before you were born.
Where is your kindergarten?
Loser!
You're so last century?
Are you crazy?
Come on.
Good boy.
- Hello.
- Hi.
I have something for you.
A present.
For me?
You steal.
No, I found it.
No.
There's good music on it. There.
Look. Pictures of some jerks.
There's a camera in it.
You can make videos. Internet.
I found it for you.
I found it. Really.
Cross my heart. Over there.
Byron, what did you do? Byron?
- God.
- Shit.
Oh God. No.
Question, please.
I want a...
Scooper?
- No, a...
- A shovel?
Yes. Big one.
Come with me, please.
- A shovel.
- Yes.
I have all kinds. Large, small...
- and low-priced shovels.
- There.
This one.
You now. Pray.
I can't.
You can. Small pray.
God, now I lay Byron down to sleep
pray the Lord his soul to keep.
Amen.
You believe in that?
I must. Or is just nothing.
Nothing.
Am afraid of big nothing.
Now I have no one.
What are you doing?
Trying to cheer myself up.
This one's nice. Different.
It changes from blue all the time.
- Think so?
- Or this one?
I like this one the best.
- Just a moment.
- This one's really nice.
Hello. How are you? Remember me?
- Yes, all okay.
- Really?
Everything related to the accident.
- Is okay.
- Well...
All the best.
- Bye.
- Goodbye.
Bye.
- Who was that?
- A client.
Come on, we don't have all day.
Super.
Don't!
- Little bit.
- No, don't.
Looks funny.
- Like old broom.
- So what?
I like my hair this way.
You said you'd do
everything for me.
I do! Hey!
But my hair stays like it is.
So not everything.
Irina!
Hey, occupied!
You always run away
when something you don't like?
Do you live here now?
Yes.
All alone?
Maybe.
Alone is dumb.
Yes, alone is dumb.
Expensive is banned!
Furniture and Kitchen Studio.
Come in.
Kitchen.
All in order.
And...
Garden.
And living room-bedroom.
I must work. Must live.
But...
...our bedroom.
Just you and me.
Will you stay?
I haven't lived in a apartment
for a long time.
You know...
I have never before...
...never with love.
Neither have I.
Hold me tight.
Tighter.
No questions?
No.
Thank you.
- You run away?
- No.
I won't run away. I promise.
Promise.
Come on. One, two, three...
- Hurry.
- What?
You must go.
Good luck.
You can do it.
Bye.
I'll put the cost down here,
Natasha.
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks.
- Did you have a good week?
- Yes.
- And you?
- A lot of aggravation. As usual.
- Ready?
- Yeah, ready.
You have it much nicer here.
It's pretty.
I like it. Especially
the little garden and the deer.
This is much better.
Loads of energy for the whole day.
And now I don't have to make
the wife wait at night.
Not so fast, Natasha. Not so fast.
Have a little spare change?
Got any spare change?
Maybe... a little spare change?
Got any spare change?
Got a few cents?
Finish? How was job?
Thank you.
You drink beer?
And job? How is job?
I quit. It was a shitty job.
My job is shit job, too.
I want to kill these shit men.
But I do job. Every day.
And you made me promise. Look...
Where are you going?
Just say it.
What?
Say it's over. Say...
"You promised me,
and now you've disappointed me,
So go!" Say it.
Say it: "Get lost!" Throw me out.
I'm ready for it. Tell me.
Man, say it!
And quit looking at me like that.
Just tell me to go!
What's so hard about that?
What? What you do you want from me?
Tell me to go! Say it!
Just throw me out.
I will never say "go".
Never
- Let go.
- No, no.
I will never say "go".
- Whoop-di-doo.
- What?
That was like whoop-di-doo.
- My first whoop-di-doo.
- Mine, too.
Are you crazy?
- Want to steal car?
- No, just sit in it with you.
I would have like to be a vet.
I want to make pretty clothes.
Sew?
Yes, want to sew pretty clothes.
Hey, you! Hey!
You stay right here, damn it!
Stop!
Dinner!
Are we ever going to eat anything
but honey?
No, I am honey bee.
- Yes, you are. A real honey.
- Yes.
Who's that?
- Hello, Lisa. What is it?
- Can I stay with you?
Yes, but where is mother?
Her new boyfriend's. She said she'd
back by nine, but it's already ten.
Bread and honey for you, too?
- Is it your dinner?
- Yes.
Do you only eat honey?
It's a steak.
A big, juicy steak. I love meat.
- And beer.
- But tastes like bread and honey.
- No.
- Like a little more gravy, Madam.
No!
What is that?
No, no, nooo!
Can you hold my hand?
So I don't lose you in dream.
- Sleep tight, my darling.
- You, too.
I make burek for you.
For tomorrow, for birthday.
- Chicken?
- Yes, will be wonderful.
Can you cut up?
Bought new knife.
- What's wrong?
- The heart's still in it.
Is fresh and good.
What is matter?
Do not look at blood?
No?
- Little bit.
- Stop it.
- Little...
- Don't, Irina... with that thing.
- Stop it!
- Just a little bit.
- Why not?
- I'm a vegetarian!
What?
I don't eat meat,
and I don't want to see it.
- Are you a man?
- Yes, and a vegetarian.
- I think Byron. You, too?
- Have you ever seen me eat meat?
I think I know you, but... no.
- Don't know anything.
- There's a lot you don't know.
- Yes, same with me.
- Because you never tell anything.
Where you come from?
What your home like?
Tell me something.
Kill me if I tell you.
Thank you.
Happy birthday.
- Thank you.
- Make a wish.
I wish it always like this.
I promise.
- You cannot promise.
- Sure, I can.
- Want present now or later?
- What is it?
- Now or later?
- Now.
Oh, no.
Please. Come on.
Today's my birthday.
Won't take long.
Oh man, couldn't you have taken
today off? Please.
Want to kill them all.
Dead. Finish.
Dead pig with dead prick.
What?
For you.
- Super.
- Yeah?
Looks like new person.
This is the best birthday
of my life.
I have one more
little present for you.
Really?
Thanks.
Know what it is?
Sure. It's the whoop-di-doo.
Yes. You are my whoop-di-doo.
And you are mine.
How long are you working today?
Only the fat swine. Then finish.
I cut off prick...
...and finish.
Hey, stop it!... Give it to me.
That thing is dangerous.
The weather is good today. We
could take a walk when I get back.
Yes, later.
- Now go.
- Don't want to.
- Must go.
- Little longer.
What's wrong?
- You can't?
- Too much political stress.
Wife trouble.
And my health could be better.
Come on. Kneel down.
Let me try it from behind.
But you know, costs more.
I know, Natasha. I'll pay.
Yes.
Oh, yes. Good. Yes.
- Slowly.
- Better.
Very slowly. Yes.
It can dam, zigzag,
It has automatic controls,
semi-automatic, anything you want.
What would be the small
installment? It's a present.
What can you afford?
20? Every week?
Every week?
Yes!
What's wrong?
Hey! Klaus, hey!
Please. No, please.
Please. Hey! Hey! Hey!
Shit, Irina, what have you done?
- Garbage bags?
- What?
Garbage bags?
Bottom shelf.
Drawstring bags.
Heavy Duty.
No Smell.
Hello.
4.98 euros, please.
So... 2.50.
It's not enough.
That enough?
Your receipt!
Mom!
- I'm here! I'm with you!
- Don't. Is okay.
- I'm here...
- No!
- Come on, don't act stupid!
- Irina!
You must not help me.
For me doesn't matter.
But that's what I'm here for.
To help you.
You must help Kalle. Yes?
My boyfriend.
I beg you. With all your power...
He only did for me.
Man... man was dead.
Understand? Already dead.
Nothing. Dead heart. Finish.
Come here and take off
all your clothes.
Turn around to the wall,
bend over
and spread your cheeks
with both hands.
Good.
Raise your right foot backward.
Now the left.
Raise your arms. Fine.
Open your mouth.
Can I keep the handkerchief?
Turn a little more to me.
A little more. Good.
Take off your panties.
- Now go over to her.
- Put the box down here, please.
I'm here, because your girlfriend
wants me to help you.
I don't need any help.
I'm lost without Irina anyhow.
If you don't talk to me,
I can't help you or her.
I just want you to help Irina.
You can help her by talking to me.
I'm not talking.
The man was already dead.
Heart attack.
She called it "dead heart".
- What?
- Can only be proved by an autopsy.
And only if you tell me what you do
with the man.
Is this a trap?
Whatever you did with him...
it wasn't necessary.
It was all for nothing.
All for nothing?
And there's a dead dog.
That's Byron.
He's my dog.
But forensics determined
the man had already died
Heart attack before he was cut.
So, case closed?
Oh, no, Mr. Leyden.
I'm going to charge the boy.
With abuse of a corpse.
Desecration of the deceased.
I must remind you of fundamentals?
What matters is
the defendant's motivation.
I have no idea why anyone would
enjoy carving up a corpse.
But he cut him up to his heart's
delight like a piece of meat!
It's the perpetrator's motivation
that counts, right?
Don't treat me
like a first-year law student.
My client didn't want
to defile the corpse.
He wanted to save his girlfriend.
Law says that
dismembering a corpse,
desecration of the deceased,
a crime.
Don't keep repeating yourself.
Prove it!
You keep repeating yourself, too.
- The with soy milk, please
- Sure.
- Espresso.
- Right.
That boy dismembered a large man
in painstakingly hard work.
It was totally whacky, but it was
the only thing that occurred to him
And it was difficult to him,
very difficult.
Can't stand the sight of blood,
so he dropped the butcher school.
And he's a vegetarian.
How cute.
All that to save his girlfriend.
That's amazing, don't you think?
- Yes.
- You see? That's just what I mean.
I wouldn't do it. Would you?
No idea.
I don't know how far I'd go.
I stole some gummy bears
for my first true love...
but that was in kindergarten.
I never did anything like that.
I never stole anything.
Not even flowers
from the park or something?
You poor thing. No mischief at all?
No!
So? Where are we?
I'm on my break.
How did he do it?
With an electric kitchen knife
He must have worked like a horse.
Like a maniac.
Would you do something like that
for me?
Would you for me?
That power love like that
must have.
Yes...
Or the fear of losing it.
I've found a legal precedent
in favor of my client.
Stealing the corpse was not
his goal. It was... misconduct.
- for reasons of love.
- For reasons of love?
- Yes, misconduct for love.
- Misconduct for love. Cute.
Fortunately, I don't have to prove
the love part.
What a relief.
- So?
- I have my doubts about love.
- That doesn't surprise me.
- The same goes for misconduct.
- But what should I do?
- What can you do?
Case closed?
Alright.
That happens to your lovebirds? She
has no papers. They'll deport her.
He's German.
He'll have to marry her.
Okay, that's an option.
But it's the end of the love story.
- Who knows?
- It is. Have a good day.
Doesn't have to be.
Thank you.
A wig.
Underwear.
A skirt.
Shoes.
And your vest.
All the best.
Who are the flowers from?
From him.
Thank you.
