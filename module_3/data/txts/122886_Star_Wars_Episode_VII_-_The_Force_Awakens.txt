This will begin to make things right.
I've traveled too far and seen too much
to ignore the despair in the galaxy.
Without the Jedi, there can be
no balance in the Force.
Well, because of you,
now we have a chance.
The General's been after this

Oh, the General?
To me, she is royalty.
Well, she certainly is that.

from one of our own.

That's where.
No. We can't go back to Jakku.
We need to get out of this system.
I gotta get my droid
before the First Order does.
- What, a droid?

He's a BB unit, orange and
white. One of a kind.
I don't care what color he is!
No droid can be that important.
This one is, pal!
We gotta get as far away from

We go back to Jakku, we die.
That droid has a map

It belonged to Poe Dameron.
That was his name, right?
He was captured by the First Order.
I helped him escape,

Poe didn't make it.
(BB-8 MOANS DEJECTEDLY)

I've never met

Well, this is what we look like.

BB-8 says he's on a secret mission.

(LOUDLY) No. No!

You can fly anywhere. Why go back?
You got a family?
You got a boyfriend? A cute boyfriend?

He's carrying a map to Luke Skywalker.
You are the Han Solo that

You knew him.
Yeah. I knew him.
I knew Luke.

Oh, great. It's the Guavian Death Gang.
Must have tracked us from Nantoon.

They're big and they're dangerous.
You ever heard of the Trillia Massacre?

You're a dead man.
Bala-Tik. What's the problem?
The problem is we loaned you

I heard you also borrowed
50,000 from Kanjiklub.
You know you can't trust

How long we known each other?
They have blasters.
A lot of them.
BALA-TIK: Not long.
We want our money back now.

Rathtars is cheap?
I spent that money.
Kanjiklub wants

There's no one in the galaxy

Hey, where are you going?
Unkar Plutt installed a fuel pump, too.
If we don't prime that,
we're not going anywhere.
I hate that guy.
- And you could use a co-pilot.
- I got one, he's back there.
(CHEWIE GROANS)
Watch the thrust. We're going
out of here at lightspeed.
From inside the hangar?
Is that even possible?
I never ask that question
till after I've done it.
- (RATHTAR GROWLS)

(THRUSTERS FIRING)
(LOUD BOOMING)
Inform the First Order...
that Han Solo has the droid they want.
And it's aboard the <i>Millennium Falcon.</i>
(ION ENGINES ROARING)
SNOKE: <i>The droid will soon be
delivered to the Resistance...</i>
leading them to the last Jedi.
If Skywalker returns...
the new Jedi will rise.
Supreme Leader,
I take full responsibility...
General!
Our strategy must now change.
The weapon. It is ready.
I believe the time has come to use it.
We shall destroy the government...
that supports the Resistance...
the Republic.
Without their friends to protect them...
the Resistance will be vulnerable.
And we will stop them
before they reach Skywalker.
Go.
Oversee preparations.
Yes, Supreme Leader.
SNOKE: There has been an awakening.
Have you felt it?
KYLO REN: <i>Yes.</i>
There's something more.
The droid we seek is aboard
the <i>Millennium Falcon.</i>
In the hands of your father...
Han Solo.
<i>He means nothing to me.</i>
Even you, master of the
Knights of Ren...
have never faced such a test.
<i>By the grace of your training,
I will not be seduced.</i>
We shall see.
We shall see.
(FUSE BLOWING)
- Electrical overload.

Coolant's leaking.
(ALARM BEEPING)

(CHOKING) Which is fine!
This hyperdrive blows,
there are gonna be...

(HYPERDRIVE NORMALIZING)
What'd you do?
I bypassed the compressor.
Huh.

- Go ahead.
- (CHEWIE EXCLAIMS)
- HAN: This map's not complete.
It's just a piece.
Ever since Luke disappeared...
people have been looking for him.
REY: Why did he leave?
He was training
a new generation of Jedi.
One boy, an apprentice...
turned against him, destroyed it all.
Luke felt responsible.
He just walked away from everything.
Do you know what happened to him?
A lot of rumors. Stories.
People that knew him best...
think he went looking
for the first Jedi temple.
The Jedi were real?
I used to wonder about that myself.
Thought it was a bunch
of mumbo-jumbo.
A magical power holding
together good and evil...
the dark side and the light.
Crazy thing is...
it's true.
The Force. The Jedi.
All of it.
It's all true.
(TERMINAL BEEPING)
- (CHEWIE GROWLS)
- No, you rest.
- (CHEWIE GRUMBLES)
- You want my help? You're getting it.
Gonna see an old friend.
She'll get your droid home.
This is our stop.
I didn't know there was
this much green...
in the whole galaxy.
(BIRDS CHIRPING)
Hey, Solo, I'm not sure what
we're walking into here...
Did you just call me Solo?
Sorry. Han. Mr. Solo.
You should know...
I'm a big deal in the Resistance.
Which puts a real target on my back.
Are there any conspirators here?
Like, First Order sympathizers?
Listen, Big Deal.
You got another problem.
Women always figure out the truth.
Always.
You might need this.
I think I can handle myself.
I know you do. That's why
I'm giving it to you.
Take it.
You know how to use one of those?
Yeah. You pull the trigger.
Little bit more to it than that.
You got a lot to learn.
You got a name?
Rey.
Rey.
I been thinking about bringing
on some more crew, Rey.
A second mate. Someone to help out.
Someone who can keep up
with Chewie and me...
appreciates the <i>Falcon.</i>
Are you offering me a job?
I wouldn't be nice to you.
Doesn't pay much.
You're offering me a job.
I'm thinking about it.
Well?
If you were, I'd be flattered.
But I have to get home.
Where, Jakku?
I've already been away too long.
Chewie, check out the ship
as best you can.
(CHEWIE GRUNTS)
That's too bad. Chewie kind of likes you.
FINN: Solo, why are we here again?
HAN: To get your droid on a clean ship.
REY: Clean?
HAN: You think it was luck
that Chewie and I found the <i>Falcon?</i>
If we can find it on our scanners...
the First Order's not far behind.
Wanna get BB-8 to the Resistance?
Maz Kanata's our best bet.
FINN: We can trust her, right?
HAN: Relax, kid.
She's run this watering hole
for a thousand years.
Maz is a bit of an acquired taste...
so let me do the talking.
And whatever you do, don't stare.

Any of it.

Han.
(SPEAKING ALIEN DIALECT)

Leia doesn't wanna see me.
Please, we came here for your help.
What fight?
The only fight.
Against the dark side.
Through the ages...
I've seen evil take many forms.
The Sith. The Empire.
Today, it is the First Order.
Their shadow is spreading
across the galaxy.
We must face them.
Fight them.
All of us.
There is no fight against the First Order.
Not one we can win.
Look around.
There's no chance we haven't

I bet you the First Order
is on their way right...

I'm looking at the eyes
of a man who wants to run.
You don't know a thing about me.
Where I'm from. What I've seen.
You don't know the First Order like I do.
They'll slaughter us.
We all need to run.
Hmm.

They'll trade work for transportation...

I'm not who you think I am.
Finn, what are you talking about?
I'm not Resistance.
I'm not a hero.
I'm a stormtrooper.
Like all of them, I was taken
from a family I'll never know.
And raised to do one thing.
But my first battle, I made a choice.
I wasn't gonna kill for them.
So I ran. Right into you.
And you looked at me
like no one ever had.
I was ashamed of what I was.
But I'm done with the First Order.
I'm never going back.

Don't go.
Take care of yourself.

No, no, no. It wasn't just me.

Keep it. It suits you.
You're a good man, Finn.

I'm sorry to interrupt. This is Finn.
- He needs to talk to you.
- And I need to talk to him.
That was incredibly brave what you did.
Renouncing the First Order,
saving this man's life.
Thank you, ma'am. But a friend
of mine was taken prisoner.
Han told me about the girl.
I'm sorry.
Finn's familiar with the weapon
that destroyed the Hosnian system.
He worked on the base.
We're desperate for anything
you can tell us.
That's where my friend was taken.
I've got to get there fast.
And I will do everything I can to help...

(GRUNTS IN AGREEMENT)

I regret to inform you...
but this map recovered from BB-8...
is only partially complete.
And even worse, it matches
no charted system on record.
We simply do not have
enough information...
to locate Master Luke.
Can't believe I was so foolish
to think I could find Luke...
and bring him home.
Leia.
Don't do that.

Anything.

R2-D2 has been in low-power mode

Sadly, he may never be
his old self again.
(CHIRPS SADLY)
HAN: Listen to me, will you?
I know every time you...
Every time you look at me
you're reminded of him.
You think I want to forget him?
I want him back.
There's nothing more we could
have done.
There's too much Vader in him.
That's why I wanted him
to train with Luke.
I just never should have sent him away.
That's when I lost him.
That's when I lost you both.
We both had to deal with it
in our own way.
I went back to the only thing
I was ever any good at.
We both did.
We lost our son.
Forever.
No.
It was Snoke.
He seduced our son to the dark side.
But we can still save him.
Me.
You.
If Luke couldn't reach him, how could I?
Luke is a Jedi.
You're his father.
There is still light in him, I know it.

He's a BB unit with a selenium drive...
and a thermal hyperscan vindicator.
It's carrying a section

And we have the rest.
Recovered from the archives
of the Empire...
but we need the last piece.
And somehow you convinced

You.

So afraid to leave.

It's in there.
And now you'll give it to me.

Ren believed it was no longer

That the girl was all we needed.
As a result, the droid has
most likely been returned...
to the hands of the enemy.
They may have the map already.
Then the Resistance
must be destroyed...
before they get to Skywalker.

We tracked their reconnaissance ship
to the Ileenium system.
Good.
Then we will crush them
once and for all.

the map from the girl.
I just need your guidance.
If what you say about this girl is true...
Bring her to me.

They've somehow created
a hyper-lightspeed weapon...
built within the planet itself.
A laser cannon?
We're not sure how to describe
a weapon of this scale.
EMATT: It's another Death Star.
I wish that were the case, Major.
This was the Death Star.
- And this is Starkiller Base.
- (ALL EXCLAIM)
So, it's big.
How is it possible to power
a weapon of that size?
It uses the power of the sun.
As the weapon is charged...
the sun is drained until it disappears.
AIDE: Ma'am.
The First Order...
they're charging the weapon again now.
Our system is the next target.
C-3PO: Oh, my.
Without the Republic fleet,
we're doomed.
Okay. How do we blow it up?
- There's always a way to do that.
- Han's right.
STATURA: In order
for that amount of power...
to be contained...
that base has to have some
kind of thermal oscillator.
There is one. Precinct 47.
Here.
STATURA: If we can destroy
that oscillator...
it might destabilize the core
and cripple the weapon.
- Maybe the planet.
- We'll go in there,
we'll hit that oscillator
with everything we've got.
They have defensive shields...
that our ships cannot penetrate.
We disable the shields.
Kid, you worked there.
What do you got?
I can do it.
I like this guy.
I can disable the shields,
but I have to be there.
On the planet.
- We'll get you there.
- Han, how?
If I told you, you wouldn't like it.
POE: So we disable the shields...
we take out the oscillator
and we blow up their big gun.
- (CHEWIE ROARS)

how much we fought...
I've always hated watching you leave.
That's why I did it.
So you'd miss me.
I did miss you.
It wasn't all bad, was it?
Huh?
Some of it was... good.

Their shields have
a fractional refresh rate.
Keeps anything traveling
slower than lightspeed...
from getting through.
We're making our landing
approach at lightspeed?
(CHEWIE GROWLS)
Chewie, get ready.
And... Now!
(THRUSTERS FIRING)
- (CHEWIE GROWLS)
- I am pulling up!
- (CHEWIE GROWLS)
- I get any higher...
they'll see us!
OFFICER: Sir, she was
not found in Hangar 718.
But all troops are on alert.
KYLO REN:
<i>Put every hangar on lockdown.</i>
<i>She's going to try to steal
a ship to esc...</i>
(SOFTLY) <i>Han Solo.</i>
The flooding tunnel is over that ridge.
We'll get in that way.
What was your job
when you were based here?
Sanitation.
- Sanitation?
- (CHEWIE GRUNTS)
Then how do you know
how to disable the shields?
I don't.
I'm just here to get Rey.
People are counting on us.
The galaxy is counting on us.
Solo, we'll figure it out.
We'll use the Force.
That's not how the Force works.
(CHEWIE GROWLS)
- Oh, really? You're cold?
- (CHEWIE GRUMBLING)
FINN: Come on.
Report.
Weapon charged in 15 minutes, sir.
STORMTROOPER: <i>Hey!</i>
HAN: The longer we're here
the less luck we're gonna have.
- The shields.
- I have an idea about that.
(PHASMA GRUNTS)
- You remember me?
<i>- FN-2187.</i>
Not anymore.
The name's Finn and I'm in charge.
I'm in charge now, Phasma.
I'm in charge.
- Bring it down. Bring it down.
- (WHISPERS) Yeah.
Follow me.
STORMTROOPER 1: <i>Have you
checked out the new T-17s?</i>
STORMTROOPER 2: <i>The T-17s,
as far as I can tell...</i>
<i>are a great improvement.</i>
STORMTROOPER 1: <i>Yeah.
That's what they tell you.</i>
<i>But believe me, they don't hold up.</i>
<i>- They don't?
- No.</i>

(INDISTINCT PA CHATTER)
(FOOTSTEPS RECEDING)
(STEAM HISSING)
FINN: You want me to blast
that bucket off your head?
Lower the shields.
PHASMA: <i>You're making a big mistake.</i>
- Do it.
- (CHEWIE GROWLS)
(INSTRUMENTS BEEPING)
Solo, if this works...
we're not gonna have
a lot of time to find Rey.
Don't worry, kid.
We won't leave here without her.
(INSTRUMENTS BEEPING)
<i>You can't be so stupid
as to think this will be easy.</i>
<i>My troops will storm
this block and kill you all.</i>
I disagree. What do we do with her?
Is there a garbage chute?
Trash compactor?
Yeah, there is.
General, their shields are down.
C-3PO: Thank the Maker!
LEIA: Han did it. Send them in.
Give Poe full authorization for attack.
Black Leader,
go to sub-lights on your call.
Roger, base.
Red squad, Blue squad, take my lead.
- (SPEAKING SULLUSTESE)
- Dropping out of lightspeed.
POE: (ON RADIO) <i>Almost in range.</i>
Hit the target dead center.
As many runs as we can get.
- Approaching target.
- (SPEAKING SULLUSTESE)
OFFICER 1: Fighters incoming!
OFFICER 2: (ON PA) <i>Coming at 28.336.</i>
OFFICER 3: Forty-five!
Shields up! Shields up!
HUX: Dispatch all squadrons.
Yes, General.
All right. Let's light it up.
- Ah, direct hit. (LAUGHS)
- But no damage!
POE: (ON RADIO) <i>Yeah, we gotta
keep hitting it.</i>
Another bombing run.
<i>Remember, when the sun is gone
that weapon will be ready to fire.</i>
But as long as there's light,
we got a chance.
(BB-8 CHIRPING RAPIDLY)
Guys, we got a lot of company!
STORMTROOPER: <i>We think
they may be splitting up.</i>
<i>Heading to quadrants 4 and 5.</i>
We'll use the charges
to blow that blast door.
I'll go in and draw fire,
but I'm gonna need cover.
You sure you're up for this?
Hell, no.
I'll go in and try to find Rey.
The troopers will be on our tail.
We have to be ready for that.
There's an access tunnel that leads...
Why are you doing that? Hmm?
Why are you doing this?
I'm trying to come up with a plan.
(LAUGHS)
(ALL YELP)
HAN: You all right?
- Yeah.
- Good.
FINN: What happened to you?
Did he hurt you?
Finn, what are you doing here?
- We came back for you.
- (CHEWIE EXCLAIMS)
What'd he say?
That it was your idea.
Thank you.
How did you get away?
I can't explain it.
And you wouldn't believe it.
Escape now, hug later.
(ION ENGINES ROARING)
I got one behind me.
<i>- You see it?</i>
- Yeah. I'm on it.
- Burillo's been hit.
- Watch out for ground fire.
HAN: They're in trouble.
We can't leave.
My friend's got a bag full of explosives.
Let's use them.
General, are you seeing this?
RESISTANCE CONTROLLER:
Two more X-wings down.
That's half our fleet destroyed.
C-3PO: And their weapon
will be fully charged in ten minutes.
It would take a miracle to save us now.
(CHEWIE GROWLS)
(REY GRUNTS)
HAN: Ah.
- Girl knows her stuff.
- (CHEWIE GROWLS)
We'll set the charges
against every other column.
(GROWLS)
You're right. That's a better idea.
You take the top. I'll go down below.
- Detonator.
- (CHEWIE GRUNTS)
We'll meet back here.
<i>Find them.</i>
Ben!
(BLASTER COCKING)
(GROWLS)
<i>Han Solo.</i>
<i>I've been waiting for this day
for a long time.</i>
(DOOR OPENING)
Take off that mask. You don't need it.
<i>What do you think you'll see if I do?</i>
The face of my son.
(HELMET HISSING)
Your son is gone.
He was weak and foolish like his father.
So I destroyed him.
That's what Snoke wants you to believe.
But it's not true.
My son is alive.
No.
The Supreme Leader is wise.
Snoke is using you for your power.
When he gets what he wants,
he'll crush you.
You know it's true.
It's too late.
No, it's not.
Leave here with me. Come home.
We miss you.
(VOICE BREAKING)
I'm being torn apart.
I want to be free of this pain.
I know what I have to do...
but I don't know if I have
the strength to do it.
Will you help me?
Yes. Anything.

Black Leader, there's a brand
new hole in that oscillator.
<i>Looks like our friends got in.</i>
Red Four, Red Six, cover us.
- I'm on it.
- Roger.
Everybody else, hit the target hard.
Give it everything you got.
I need some help here.
I need some help!
- Coming in!
- Watch out!
I'm hit!
All teams, I'm going in.
<i>Pull up and cover me.</i>
Copy that, Black Leader.
Good luck, Poe.

Get back to your station!
Just look! We won't survive.
Even Hux is gone.
HUX: Supreme Leader.
The fuel cells have ruptured.
The collapse of the planet has begun.
Leave the base at once
and come to me with Kylo Ren.
It is time...
