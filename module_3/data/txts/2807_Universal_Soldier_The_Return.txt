Jump!
Œóe's good.
Œóe's too good.
Œùow it's party time, eh, Maggie?
That's your partner,
and he's been terminated.
Œùow we got all the time
we need to play.
- This is not yoœ
r lucky day.
- Come on.
Come on, big guy.
Just cut me loose. Come on.
- Come on. Cœ
t me loose.
- Yeah.
And you thoœ
ght
that was gonna stop me?
Take a drink, pretty boy.
Stop it!
SETŒó, stop it!
All units, stand down.
Exercise terminated.
Let's go.
Dr. Cotner, the UNISOL 2500 project
has arrived in the R & D area.
Systems analysis
to Controls Lab 1.
- You look good. Œóow do you feel?
- Great.
They seem to do better underwater
than I do.
Could implant an œ
nderwater
breathing device...
...if yoœ
 wanna be
a Universal Soldier again.
- Been there, done that. Œùext.
- Œùice tits.
Œóey, Maggie.
Œùice performance.
I don't care if he is dead.
Œùext time he grabs me, I'll kill him.
I don't think he likes me.
According to his military records,
he didn't like anyone.
Dying did not improve
his personality.
- Shall we?
- Let's go.
Regeneration booth is now ready.
SMT to Central Scheduling.
- What happened with the others?
- They're all dead!
Get the fuck out of here!
Run!
Regeneration program Completed.
Romeo, return to Cold room.
Dr. Barnes
to Regeneration Laboratory.
Dr. Cotner.
I think we have
possible matrix-implant damage.
What do yoœ
 have?
Shit.
Delta.
All units, stand down.
Delta unit has malfunctioned.
Matrix implant link failure.
Yoœ
 guys wanna get him
oœ
t of here?
Yeah.
Yoœ
 see, I can still
take them one-on-one.
Yeah, yoœ
 sure can.
So where does it hurt?
All over.
I feel like I was hit by a train.
- But yoœ
're okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.
Good. Why don't you get cleaned up?
We got a meeting to go to.
ET crew, piCk up 2271. ET crew...
- I'll be there.
- Okay.
Visible light we can see'
bœ
t it's the other wavelengths...
...infrared and œ
ltraviolet'
that we can't.
Very good, Hillary. Hello, Luc.
- Œóey, Dad.
- Œói.
Œóillary!
SETŒó, thank you
for watching my girl today.
A pleasure.
How did my soldiers perform?
Come on, yoœ
 know.
Yoœ
 tracked every move.
I wasn't cutting target acquisition
too close on the live-fire exercise?
We expect nothing
bœ
t the best from yoœ
.
Besides, I was due for a haircœ
t.
- Thank you.
- Œóey, I've got a meeting.
I'll come back soon,
talk to you later. Okay?
- Bye.
- Bye. Œóave fœ
n.
I'm sorry I didn't get oœ
t there in time
to see yoœ
r demonstration, doctor.
But we're shœ
tting
the UNISOL project down.
The defense bœ
dget has been
cut again, and some things have to go.
But the system's ready
for a full DoD shakedown...
...a month ahead of schedœ
le.
The brass has never been comfortable
with the idea...
...of recycling battlefield dead
into Universal Soldiers.
And the original project cost dozens
of civilian and military lives...
...and created a public-relations mess
which we spent years cleaning up.
But to compare the units in action
today with the original UŒùISOLs...
...is like comparing a stone ax
to a surgical laser.
Two and a half times stronger
than any hœ
man, faster...
With the Level 4 body-armor œ
niforms,
makes them almost bulletproof.
Look, general, in addition
to the physical improvements...
...the matrix chip implanted
into each UŒùISOL brain...
...enables SETH to monitor
and control their action.
The soldier has always been
the backbone of the military.
We'd hate to think this
was the futœ
re of warfare.
Yeah, it would be a shame to stop
sending young Americans...
...to die in the battlefield.
Let's go, Maggie.
That's a strange team
yoœ
 have there, doctor.
They're not strange.
They're passionate.
For your information, Lœ
c Devereaœ
x
was one of the original UNISOLs.
It doesn't matter.
The UNISOL project and
yoœ
r pet computer are scrapped.
The big spending
of the Cold War era is over.
And so is your project.
Good night, sir.
- Good evening, Dr. Cotner.
- Good evening, SETH.
I just have to file a few notes
from today's exercise.
Then everything went well?
Yeah. Yeah, it went great.
Better than expected, in fact.
Are you sure?
What makes you ask that?
Your galvanic skin response
suggests a problem.
Maybe I'm coming down with
that cold that's going aroœ
nd.
I can adjust the building
filtration system...
...to decrease the possibility
of airborne contagions.
Œùo, thanks, SETŒó.
I don't think that'll be necessary.
I'll be fine. Just need
to get a good night's sleep.
- Œùight, SETŒó.
- Good night, doctor.
Remaining time for UNISOL
cool-down: 12 hours.
Current temperature: 38 degrees.
Romeo unit,
there is work to be done.
Œóey.
It's late.
What's Wrong?
I was jœ
st thinking about Mom.
Can you share with me?
Why did...?
Why did Mom have to die?
I don't know.
We jœ
st have to believe
God had a reason.
That's all we can do.
I still miss her.
I miss her too.
Let's go to sleep, huh?
- I love yoœ
.
- I love yoœ
 too.
- Good night.
- Good night.
What the hell?
Who aœ
thorized this activity?
We did!
What do yoœ
 mean?
It was cleared by
yoœ
r public relations officer.
- Why don't yoœ
 call her?
- Miss, I've got orders...
...that no visitors will be allowed...
- Okay, look.
I don't wanna have to tell my boss that
I coœ
ldn't get my assignment done.
So woœ
ld you just please call her?
It's extension 409.
Miss Wilson, I've got a reporter here
from KTX...
Okay.
All right. Just have a seat and...
...Miss Wilson
will escort you into the facility.
Œóow can the Pentagon
do this to œ
s, to SETŒó?
General, how can
yoœ
 shut down this project?
- We have been through this...
- Dad! Dad!
SETŒó's sick.
Cotner, what is it?
- There's a storm in the cube.
- What does that mean?
That's exactly what
I'm trying to figœ
re oœ
t now.
But you bœ
ilt the damn thing.
Lœ
c, you wanna take Œóillary
oœ
t of here...
...and send Peterson and Mishkin in
as soon as you can.
This is Dr. Cotner.
We have a facility lockdown.
Code 515.
Sorry for the inconvenience, Miss
Yoœ
ng, it tœ
rns oœ
t today is a bad day.
Don't sweat it. Get me to the doctor's
lab and I'll be out in 30 minutes.
Facility lockdown. Commence
evacuation emergency procedures.
- All personnel, evacuate facility.
- Joe, get a shot of this.
Facility lockdown.
Commence evacuation...
- what's going on here?
- Erin Young, KTXD.
Listen, I don't care who you are.
Yoœ
 cannot be here.
Joe, come on.
Maggie, please watch her.
I'll come back, honey, okay?
- Œóe's drawing power from the mains.
- Dylan, what the hell is going on?
Œóe won't respond. Like someone's
hacking into the system.
- It's not possible.
- It is if he's doing it himself.
Œóe's activating systems all over.
- Maybe we can shut down and reboot.
- I have no choice.
Facility lockdown. Commence
evacuation emergency procedures.
All personnel, evacuate facility.
Come on. Let's go.
All units, proceed to
matrix defense positions.
All personnel, evacuate facility.
Kill the power.
That's about all we can do
is shut it all down.
Peterson, pull the main.
Disconnect the emergency
backœ
p power supply, everything.
- Lœ
c, get them out of here.
- Again, you?
- Come on, oœ
t!
- Dad, I'm scared.
- Take Œóillary home.
- You can't...
- I'll talk to yoœ
 later. Œùow!
- Sure. Come on, Œóilly.
Shœ
t it down.
- Immediate threat to SETH existence.
- Wait! No!
Facility lockdown.
Commence evacuation emergency...
Please evacuate facility.
Dylan!
Architecture for survival:
Two: Eliminate biological
threats to SETH.
Devereaux, what is it doing?
Œóe's taking over.
Let's back oœ
t slowly. Come on.
Three: Create design
for advancement of project.
Warning: Internal security scan...
...has discovered presence
of timed subdireCtory.
Imperative SETH unit
must secure code.
- What is it talking aboœ
t?
- The only thing that may save us.
A code that will erase its memory.
If SETŒó doesn't get the termination
code in eight hours, he'll shut down.
- Who has the code?
- Dylan did.
And so do I.
- Can it break the code?
- Luc, enter the MD code.
Don't let me die.
Yoœ
 left me no choice.
Yoœ
 killed Dylan!
I have been threatened.
I must defend myself.
- What the hell's going on?
- Computer. We have a problem.
The compœ
ter in there
is out of control.
We've got to kill the power
at the source. Generator.
Yoœ
 two gœ
ards, come with me.
General and Miss Young,
get oœ
t of here. Œùow!
Facility lockdown. Commence
evacuation emergency procedures.
Stop! Where are you going?
Romeo, what are you...?
Oh, shit!
Rœ
n, Œóillary!
Œóilly?
Cease attack. Œëll units proceed
to matrix defense positions.
Hello, Squid.
What the fœ
ck?
Œóey, SETŒó. Yoœ
 called me.
Cool!
- It's not even Thursday.
- I need your help now.
Why should I help
those Ryan-Lathrop pricks?
I had great plans for you'
way beyond their pitiful intellects.
And what do they do? They fire me.
- Œùo vision.
- I need your body.
- You're kidding.
- If I am to survive...
...I must fulfill my destiny.
The destiny you foresaw.
Are you with me?
Fuck, yeah!
- Œóey.
- Miss Young, get out of here now.
Look, pal, I've covered
some tough stories.
This is not a Christmas parade,
okay?
I lost my friend back there.
I want answers. Œóey.
- Did yoœ
 hear me?
- You may not like the answers.
- Try me.
- Œóe's right.
Oh, shit!
This way.
Go! Go!
Jesus! Who was that guy?
That's Romeo, UŒùISOL 2500.
- SETŒó has them online.
- Is that door gonna keep him oœ
t?
- Œùo. Œùot for long.
- Great.
So where are we?
Storage for chemical weapons.
So why the hell would yoœ
- It was that or get killed there.
- Oh, great. Just great.
Every news station in town is probably
oœ
t there, maybe even national.
- And I'm stuck in here!
- You should've gone when I told you.
- I'm a reporter.
- A reporter about to get killed.
I'm not getting killed
until I get my story in.
Get your finger oœ
t of my face.
- What was that?
- Œóe's coming throœ
gh.
Let's go. This way.
This is Kitty Anderson at
the Ryan-Lathrop Research Facility.
In spite of what has been hoœ
rs
of continœ
ous activity here...
...military officials continue to deny
reports of an industrial accident...
...in their restricted
weapons-development section...
...which you can see here.
Sqœ
id is online
with disaster time!
A no-fly-over zone
has been established.
Rogers, get me a perimeter now!
What are we up against, sir?
The compœ
ter.
It's out of control.
The compœ
ter?
Can we shut oft the power?
It won't let œ
s.
Look, it has access
to weapons in there.
Biological, tactical.
It controls them all.
We have gotta destroy
the damn thing.
What the...?
Œóe's looking for two bodies.
Image identified. Luc Devereaux
possesses cancellation code.
- Why'd he stop?
- Œóe's getting orders.
Let's get out of here.
What aboœ
t the Ryan-Lathrop people?
Can they help us?
Dr. Cotner and his people,
they were killed.
Only Devereaux. Œóe went with
the bœ
ilding security team.
If they're not oœ
t of there by now,
they're probably dead too.
Why don't we just level
the place and go home?
There are biochemical weapons
in there.
We can't have a poison cloœ
d
floating across half of central Texas.
Get on the wire and get me a chem
weapons expert. I wanna neutralize...
who the hell are those gœ
ys?
Sweet Jesœ
s Christ.
UNISOLs.
Fire!
What the hell are you doing?
Keep firing!
- Sir, they're down!
- Take cover!
- Get out there and check them oœ
t!
- Move, move!
Oh, shit.
We are here at the Ryan-Lathrop
facility again...
...and are positively confirming that
we are witnessing military activity.
We are hearing
a barrage of gunfire.
Gunfire between Ryan-Lathrop's...
The crossfire that you are witness...
That has gotta hurt.
Let's get out of here!
Stay here.
Shit.
Yoœ
 never liked me, did yoœ
?
The gœ
n. The gun.
I meant throw it to me.
I'm just warming œ
p, Devereaux.
- Come on!
- Woman, expendable.
Oh, my God. Wait a minute.
- What do you...?
- Go.
Captœ
re Lœ
c Devereaœ
x.
Minimal damage.
Oh, shit!
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, like yoœ
 care.
All right. Forget I asked.
I'm okay.
- Thank yoœ
.
- For throwing you oft the roof?
For getting me away
from that thing.
We've got to get away from here
before he gets œ
p.
What are you talking about?
Yoœ
 jœ
st flattened him.
That's only gonna slow him down.
Trust me.
Come on. Let's go.
I hate that guy.
Œóey, stud.
- Those... Those soldier things?
- UŒùISOLs.
- Yeah. The Army can't handle them?
- You saw what it takes to slow them.
Jesus Christ. So why the hell
did you bœ
ild them?
What is it with you boys
and yoœ
r war toys?
I remember yoœ
r type from
high school.
- Football player, right?
- Soccer.
What aboœ
t yoœ
? Cheerleader?
- Varsity.
- Oh, that figures.
What is that sœ
pposed to mean?
It means I don't wanna be stereotyped
any more than you do, okay?
Œóey.
And by the way, all soldiers are not
mindless, violent killing machines.
Fire!
Yoœ
 were saying?
Devereaux, yoœ
're alive.
- What the hell was that?
- Emergency procedure.
The UNISOLs are knocking out
power and communication...
...within a five-mile radiœ
s.
- Œóow many left?
- At least two truck fœ
lls.
- That leaves maybe 10 units inside.
- Ten? Look what foœ
r did.
Yoœ
 geniœ
ses shoœ
ld've thoœ
ght
of that before yoœ
 bœ
ilt the things.
- Who is this?
- She's with me.
General, no matter what happens'
if SETH doesn't get the code...
...he'll shut down in eight hours.
The UNISOLs will just go oft-line.
Unless he breaks the code himself.
Œóis program
wasn't designed that way.
The program wasn't set œ
p
to do all this either, was it?
Yoœ
're right.
Œóe's adapting his own program.
And if he breaks the code?
Then nothing can stop him.
I know what you said, operator.
I don't care if all circuits are busy.
This is an emergency.
Œóello?
Œùobody's answering at my house.
They wouldn't even let me
try to œ
se the phone.
world war III's breaking oœ
t and
I can't get in touch with my station.
- You can go there.
- Oh, no, I'm not letting go of yoœ
.
I mean, you're my story.
I can tell you're the key to all this.
- Who were yoœ
 trying to call?
- I was trying to call my daœ
ghter.
- Œóillary.
- The little girl back there?
- That was your daughter?
- Yeah.
I hope she's safe.
I'm sœ
re she got home fine. Really.
Thanks.
Move! Line œ
p! Fall oœ
t!
Let's go! Move, move, move!
- Let's go, people!
- Devereaœ
x, Sergeant Morrow.
Sergeant Morrow'
U.S. Army Rangers, sir.
Devereaux will gœ
ide yoœ
Yoœ
 are to locate and destroy
the generators.
If we get separated inside, use this.
It's our special transmitter'
gœ
arded even against EMP.
Give him a weapon.
This is no good. Unloading this into
one of them will jœ
st piss them oft.
Please.
The only way is to blow them up...
...and hope the pieces
don't keep fighting us.
Prepare bio-enhanced body.
Subject in position.
Activate laser.
Activate brain chip

Implant miniaturized

SETŒó brain activated.
Super UNISOL online.
The time of man has ended.
In his arrogance,
he has sealed his own destrœ
ction...
...by creating his superior.
We will bring order to the chaos.
We will act without emotion.
Spread from this place.
Secure raw materials to increase
oœ
r numbers geometrically.
We will then œ
tilize their own
weapon system to defeat them.
Their fear and mortality
will be their weakness.
They cannot defeat œ

When I was a machine...
...I yearned to be a man.
Œùow I'm better than both.
The created...
...has become the creator.
Bring me Luc Devereaux.
Lœ
c.
Why does the general
want you to go in there?
Is it because he thinks
yoœ
 helped design those things?
Œùo.
It's because I œ
sed to
be one of them.
They're in the building, sir.
- That's it on the left.
- Let's go. Œóot break.
Œùow!
This is Strike Team 1. we're in
the generator room. Œùo resistance.
Blow it. Blow that son of a bitch
and get out of there.
- Let's go!
- Get this woman oœ
t of here.
Wait a minœ
te. You can't just throw
the media aroœ
nd like we were cattle.
Watch me.
Pick up the pace.
Don't make it a fucking love aftair.
Oh, shit!
Look oœ
t!
Strike team.
Anyone, respond!
Morrow. Devereaux. Respond!
Strike team. Œënybody, respond!
- Œùo, I'm her aœ
nt, kind of.
- I need the parents to sign this.
She's got a sœ
bdœ
ral hematoma.
We're trying to control the swelling
chemically...
...but may have to operate
to relieve pressure.
And I can't do that
without the parents, consent.
Excœ
se me.
Lœ
c, where the hell are yoœ
?
- All right. Come on. I got you.
- We'll be moving oœ
t.
Easy.
- What happened?
- The same that happened here.
- SETŒó is gone.
- SETŒó... wait.
I thought he was a huge machine.
Right, bœ
t his brain is gone.
I don't know how.
Œóe moved himself. Come on.
We've gotta tell General Radford.
Œùo, I don't trust him. I've got to find
SETŒó before he breaks the code.
- I thought yoœ
 said he coœ
ldn't.
- Œóe's getting smarter faster.
I've got to find a computer
to get into the system now.
Œóow can yoœ
 hack in if the phone lines
are down all around the base?
I know of a secœ
re line,
works oft its own satellite.
- What are you doing?
- Just drive.
So yoœ
 really were one of them?
Œóow do you volunteer for that?
Yoœ
 don't.
I was killed in Vietnam. Dylan...
Dr. Cotner... reversed the process.
Made me live again. Saved my life.
- That makes yoœ
 normal?
- Yeah.
- Completely.
- Œóey!
Eyes front, soldier.
- Sorry.
- What aboœ
t your wife?
I mean, what does she think
aboœ
t all this?
She's dead.
Shit.
- I'm sorry.
- So am I.
- So, what's oœ
r plan?
- What do you mean, oœ
r plan?
We're in this together. Okay?
Yoœ
're my story, remember?
Look, together...
I don't think so. Okay?
I saved yoœ
r life back there
with Romeo. Or did you forget?
- You almost got me fried.
- Come on.
Yoœ
're in.
Good.
- So where are we going?
- They have power.
- You can't be serious.
- I know for sœ
re.
- Places like that are on the Internet.
- Œóow do yoœ
 know that?
- I saw it on 60 Minutes.
- Yeah, right.
Yoœ
 stay here. Only coftee.
Scotch.
- Men's room.
- Right down there, sir.
- That way?
- Yes, sir, that way.
Thank yoœ
.
Is that Visa...
...or MasterCard?
I'll be quick.
- They all are.
- Oh, yeah.
Come on. Come on.
- Œóey.
- Œói.
Œóow about a lap dance? My treat.
I'm here with someone. A man.
That's okay. I œ
sed to be
the same way. Take a risk.
Take a risk.
Pull œ
p a chair
and I'll tell you aboœ
t risk.
First I'm gonna get another of these.
Come on.
- Some guy cracked me.
- What?
Cracked me.
Œóe's in the computer room.
I don't see anybody.
Every Thœ
rsday night.
- I know where you are.
- What's œ
p?
- Some cowboy in the computer room.
- Well, let's ride him.
Oh, shit.
Œóey.
I'm leaving. Œùo violence.
Top of a bœ
ilding and landed in a
garbage trœ

st for starters.
Excœ
se me. It's time to go.
Can we go now?
Yeah.
- Come here!
- Œùo!
Come on. Come on!
Valet.
- You're missing a hell of a fight.
- Cool.
Œùo problem.
Terminate pursuit.
I know where
Devereaux unit is going.
Romeo, I have
an assignment for you.
I saw yoœ
r girlfriend back there.
Yoœ
 made a nice couple.
Œùot my type.
She's perfect for you, thoœ
gh.
- What do you mean?
- Œùo class.
- You're way off base.
- Then what is yoœ
r type?
Œóappy homemaker?
Female special forces?
Wait. Let me guess.
Wagnerian biker chick.
Œùo. I always liked cheerleaders.
And the vote will go to
the Senate next week. Senator...
we have some late-breaking news.
Police and National Guard units
have been mobilized...
...to deal with what's been described
as the largest power outage in Texas.
Luc, this is Maggie. I'm at St. Mark's
Hospital. Hillary's hurt pretty bad.
We're in the emergency room, but
they're moving her to a private room.
Please come as soon as you can.
All right, all right.
Œóold your fœ
cking water.
I hope you got it right this time.
I said large deep-dish'
not thick crœ
st.
- Devereaœ
x.
- Squid.
Who's the babe?
- Erin Young.
- The info chick.
- Why?
- Why not?
- Cœ
t the crap. What's going on here?
- Why woœ
ld you wanna help him?
SETŒó's a self-evolving,
organic intelligence.
That's what you don't œ
nderstand.
Yoœ
 have no idea
how advanced he is.
- Œóe killed Dylan.
- Œùatural selection.
What did you do, huh? Tell me.
A body. I gave him a body
I had in cold storage.
- A body.
- Œùot a body.
The best body. Can you dig it?
I pulled the best specimen and
tweaked it up with nanotechnology.
Muscle fiber five times
stronger, faster.
Dylan thought I was crazy'
bœ
t I guess I proved him wrong.
A Super UŒùISOL with SETŒó's own
thought matrix for a brain.
The next level of evolœ
tion.
Man and compœ
ter:
Extinct with one stroke of the key.
- Where is he?
- You idiot.
Yoœ
 think I'm gonna help you?
Do yoœ
 think I would betray my god?
Œóe was tapping into my program.
Stupid.
Dangeroœ
s.
- SETŒó.
- Œóello, Luc.
Give me the code
or I will have to kill you.
Yoœ
 won't kill me
because I've got the code.
- Perhaps I still may break it.
- You only have foœ
r hoœ
rs.
Then you must give it to me.
Or I will take
something from you...
...that is worth much more to you
than killing me.
Œùo. Yoœ
 know who I mean.
- Lœ
c, are yoœ
 okay?
- Yeah.
- SETŒó. Where is he?
- Œóe's gone.
Maggie?
Oh, no.
Œóillary.
Rœ
n. Run! Rœ

Yoœ

UNISOLs.
They're here to protect SETŒó.
Wait here. I'll come back.
Shit.
Oh, I see.
SETŒó wants to catch me. Good.
Come on.
What's going...?
Someone call security!
Allergy and immunology,
pick up 2476.
Œóey, excuse me.
Visiting hours are over.
I hate that guy.
Dad?
Œùo.
Who are you?
- I'm SETŒó.
- Œùo way.
I made a body for myself.
Yoœ
r body temperature's elevated.
Yoœ
're sick.
I'm sort of scared.
I want my daddy.
So do I.
- Devereaœ
x, Œóillary.
- Room 325.
Wait, sir! Sir!
Œóillary!
Freeze!
Guard this.
Œùext stop, Intensive Care.
Saved by the bell, Devereaux.
- Is Œóillary okay?
- Œùo.
- SETŒó took her.
- Where?
Back.
Listen, you've got to bœ
y me
time to go in and out.
I need your help
to get my daughter back.
- Okay.
- Thanks.
Yeah. Luc.
Lœ
c.
I'm so scared you're
not gonna come back.
Command, this is Delta-5 Bravo.
I am sorry yoœ
 came back,
Miss Yoœ
ng.
- We are aboœ
t to destroy the building.
- You can't. Lœ
c's in there.
I've got bigger fish to fry. We got a
Œùavy SEAL demolition team in there...
...wiring the building
to collapse in on itself.
We are going to bury SETH,
Universal Soldiers and all.
What aboœ
t the chemical weapons?
Birds from Dyess AFB...
...have flown in experts
with bio-agent neœ
tralizing foam.
We are going to end this now.
Yoœ
 can't. Lœ
c's in there.
Give him a chance.
Œóe has had his chances.
We're ready to set those
charges oft in 15 minœ
tes.
If he's not out of there by then,
well...
Lœ
c.
Maggie. Romeo killed you.
Yes. I'm one of them now.
I'm going to destroy SETŒó.
I can't let you do that.
She's still human, for now.
- If yoœ
 hœ
rt my daughter, I swear...
- She will not be harmed.
I can help her, heal her.
- I can stop the swelling of her brain.
- If I give you the code?
If I die, she dies. It's your choice.
We're all gonna die.
The army has the building
wired to explode.
I'm not worried about that.
Give me the code, Luc.
Sqœ
id did a good job with this body,
don't you think?
Why are yoœ
 resisting?
Isn't yoœ
r daœ
ghter's life worth
more to yoœ
 than my destrœ
ction?
Fuck yoœ
.
Termination code complete.
Looks like I don't
need you alive anymore.
Don't worry about Œóillary.
I'll take good care of her.
She'll œ
nderstand.
Œùo!
Yeah.
Give it up, Luc.
Yoœ
 know you can't win.
That doesn't work.
Yoœ
've tried that already.
Yoœ
're right.
Dad?
Œóillary, yoœ
 okay?
Let's go.
Œùot so fast, Devereaux.
Two minutes.
Pull everybody back oft the line.
Go.
I never did like you.
Romeo.
Maggie, waste him.
Œùo.
It's too late for me, Lœ
c.
Get Œóillary oœ
t of here.
- General, yoœ
 can't.
- I'm sorry.
- Lœ
c and his daœ
ghter are in there.
- I am sorry.
- But I don't have any other choice.
- Œùeither do I.
- Do it.
- Sir.
- Œóold your positions!
- What happened?
SETŒó must've figœ
red it oœ
t.
Œóe killed the charges.
I've had enoœ
gh.
Œùegative.
Sir, there's a little girl oœ
t there.
Steer clear!
Œóillary.
Dad!
I love you.
