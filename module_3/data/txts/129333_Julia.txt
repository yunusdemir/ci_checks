- A Coca-Cola. How much is it?
- Two Mark.
Beer, Coca-Cola, juice!
Is it free here?
Good day. Is it free here?
Your tickets please.
Sorry. Your tickets please.
Thank you.
Hello.
- Where're you going? On vacation?
- Yes.
- Alone?
- I am going to my father in Sirmione.
- Cigarette?
- Thanks.
It is chilly and beautiful here.
Cramped.
Hey, Dad! Here!
Hi, Pauli. Fun to have you back.
How was the trip?
- It went well.
- Long time ago. Wait...
I'll see if my girlfriend came
with the train. There she is! Yvonne!
- Here he is, Pauli.
- Hi.
Good day.
We have already met.
We sat in the same compartment.
- Funny. And you didn't know?
- He could be your brother.
Bye.
If I had known that it was your Pauli...
There was also an incredibly
handsome man there.
An awesome guy... He was about to
to rape me in the compartment.
And if Pauli hadn't come...
- How are the grades?
- Excellent as usual.
Good, good.
How is it going for us?
Alpenblick is full,
Goldener Hirsch is almost full.
The boss is pregnant with an American.
Your wife takes over... She wants
to take over everything. What a monster!
- Enough now. How is she?
- She's always angry when she sees me.
But to all others she's very friendly.
Does she have a new lover?
Not as far as I know. She could well
have fucked with the entire hotel chain.
So, boy.
Now you're in a real boarding school.
Today, we'll have spaghetti
all vongole and château brian.
- Has Erhard come yet?
- Yes, he asked for you.
Andrea is also there. She looks
with longing glances at our house.
She can wait.
Aunt Miriam and Uncle
Alex are raging there too.
Alex composes a new opera:
"The Surge of Lesbos."
Mr. Loibner! Mr. Loibner!
The food is ready. Guests have arrived.
Guests have come.
Guests have come.
Guests have come...
No, Mr Alex! Stop it!
Pauli has come, you meatloaf.
You insane walrus!
Leave the surge of Lesbos
alone! Get out!
Come with me.
Pauli! My little goldfish!
So good to see you! I come down.
- My dear nephew!
- Hi to you, Pauli.
- Hi, Aunt Miriam.
- "Aunt Miriam"...
- It was delicious, granny.
- Thank you.
- Tastes good?
- Yes, thank you.
- Silvana is good to cook.
- For a lesbian meal.
It feels as if the breakers
of Lesbos are in my stomach.
- Tasted fine, Yvonne?
- Yes, but it was a bit too much.
You're too thin.
Ralph, tell her she must eat,
otherwise she's just skin and bones.
Today's girls... You must fear
that they break in the middle.
- Don't you want cake, Yvonne?
- Tell her that I'm chock full.
Give me the cream!
It's so great that everyone's here.
There's nothing worse
than when the house is empty.
My little boy...
You've become a real man.
- You want a cigar?
- Yes, thank you.
Silvana!
Give the young man a brandy as well!
Take, my little boy. Thank you.
Thank you.
When I was 16, I smoked like a chimney.
And I drank like a sponge.
Anyway I became 75.
Cheers for your award!
Cheers, old boy.
Silvana...
Take a coffee to my room.
Good coffee with lots of cream.
A lot of cream.
The two beauties.
You heard them moaning...
The two lesbians covered with cream...
I go and rest a bit.
Are you coming too?
So... ready.
I'm bored already.
You know, of course, Yvonne...
Grandma and Aunt Miriam,
and this lesbian Hitler-type...
And fat lump Alex...
I am here for Paul's sake.
We haven't met a whole year.
He is boarding all year round.
I always feel guilty.
By the way...
I want to finish my story.
I went into the toilet.
The door was unlocked accidentally.
Yes? Go on!
Then this man came in and said...
What was it again?
He was at least very strong and horny.
He said: "it is narrow here."
No, that was what I said.
"Cool and lovely," he said.
I got goosebumps.
- Like now?
- Shall I go on?
Please!
The coffee, Signora.
- Sit down.
- No, Signora. I need to go down again.
No, Silvana. You stay here.
We'll drink coffee with cream together.
You do like whipped cream?
Sure, Signora.
But I must go down to Grandma.
Sit down.
Vips. And voila.
Now my little kitten.
Now I'll eat you.
Lick, lick.
Pauli! Hello!
Hello!
- How long have you been here?
- Two hours.
- Have you met Erhard?
- Yesterday. He's coming back later.
- Excuse me...
- Doesn't matter.
I like the piece.
- What, who?
- The music.
Perhaps the rhythm, but not otherwise.
It's too jazzy for me.
I rather listen to jazz
than pop. Pop music is passé.
Can you put this on me?
A delicate girl like you
should be careful with the sun.
Hello mister!
- Are you still a virgin?
- Yes.
- You? Have you done it with many?
- A few.
Come, Pauli.
I don't want to right now.
We rather do it at home in bed.
See, Erhard is coming.
Hi, Erhard!
Salutti, salutti,
three women, six tutti.
Amore, amore... I asked for you.
Are you coming to the arcade?
- Yeah.
- I don't want to.
Women...
Andrea gets prettier and prettier.
- Have you...?
- No. I tried recently.
- She's a virgin. She doesn't want to.
- What does that mean?
She's fighting with teeth and claws.
Pure iron maiden.
She's certainly frigid.
- I don't think so.
- She is. I feel such.
- Have you ever fucked, then?
- What?
- Yes, with several girls.
- How many?
Eight or nine, for sure.
Getting drunk is foolish.
I have something better:
Hashish. I got it from
a guy at school.
I have plenty at home.
It works perfectly.
Tomorrow we take Andrea
on a boat trip and then...
Quiet, quiet!
Where is Pauli, our tennis star?
No idea. Maybe swimming...
... with Andrea and Erhard.
Now we can start, kids!
- People, who plays with grandma?
- You.
Grandma, you play with me!
Hopefully I find some space next to you.
- Fatty serves.
- No insults from the judge!
Watch out, Grandma!
15:0
Oh, sorry, grandmother!
Netball. Last attempt.
First set: 6:4
Fatty serves.
Pull deep, Andrea.
- Pull deep in...
- Yes, deeper.
The smoke must go all the way in!
Not just the smoke. Everything must go in.
Everything needs to go deep into...
Andrea...
- "Andrea," he said.
- Deep...
- Pull it deeply.
- Now he also starts.
Soon I'll laugh.
I start to giggle...
Everything is so soft.
Run, Grandma!
I also want to be included.
Stop it. You are so fussy.
Look, Pauli.
Look what Andrea has under here!
Run! Run!
I'm afraid. You are crazy, Erhard.
Leave Erhard be!
Silvana!
- Meatloaf.
- Lick, lick.
I think I get nauseous.
Andrea, tell him to stop!
Why? It's wonderful.
Are you afraid, Pauli?
Maybe he doesn't dare to fuck.
There won't be any fucking.
I am still a virgin.
Just as Paul is.
Look here, Andrea.
What is it? It is hard.
It certainly is, yes.
Andrea, I love you.
- Stop it, Erhard!
- Let me go.
Leave him. Leave him now.
He shall take my virginity.
Okay, my little friend...
Look!
A fish!
There!
Erhard...
Erhard!
I'm coming.
Erhard!
Turn harder.
It's her fault that Pauli has a bad time.
I can't stand her any more.
Won't he come down?
- He wants to eat in his room.
- It's three days now.
I have an idea. We go
to Verona with Pauli and Andrea.
- Hello! Andrea!
- Yes?
- Come here.
- Please wait.
So great!
So, signor Pauli.
Eat well, feel better.
Soon fresh.
So, Pauli.
Pauli... Signor Pauli...
Pauli! Pauli!
Have you gone crazy?!
- How is the patient?
- Better, thanks.
How nice.
Finally, some air.
The house is nice, but playing tennis
and the constant eating is boring.
Eating all day...
I have gone up at least two pounds.
Yvonne? We go to 'Due Torri'
tonight. They have good food.
Eating again...
- Did you order a double room for the kids?
- Yes... Why?
- Are you trying to pair them?
- Pauli is in love with Andrea.
- Are the shops open still?
- Sure, why?
I'd like to buy something.
- What?
- I don't know. Something.
- Something special?
- No. A dress, a necklace...
It depends on what you will pay.
Take whatever Andrea, please.
I need to talk a little with Pauli.
It's a pity that we meet so rarely.
But you have only two years left.
Afterwards real life starts.
Cheers!
Cheers, cheers to your old cunning.
Why do you say that?
You take care to get
everything you want.
You learn as time goes by...
One must learn to plan things.
Both at work and in private life.
One must be able to... direct a bit.
Otherwise, life slips out of your hands.
At your age it's normal
with a little chaos.
Chaos...
- There you go.
- Thank you.
Two more, please.
- Do you like Andrea?
- Sure. Why?
I like her very much.
Why not?
- Cheers to you, Pauline.
- Prostate.
- Where are they?
- All women are pigs.
I'll show you the balcony
where Julia was.
Here it is.
On this balcony
Julia waited for her Romeo.
Wait, I'll call her. Julia!
No one's at home.
Wait, I'll go up.
Go with her, Pauli.
You will be Romeo!
Julia?
"Oh Romeo, where art thou Romeo?"
"Deny thy father and thy name!"
"If you do not want it,
then swear that you love me."
Great, Julia. Continue!
"Only my name is my enemy."
"You are everything, and Montague nothing.
Montague is just a word."
"Not hand, not foot, not arm
no face, no other part..."
Let's go, Ralph.
Shall we go ahead? I will go.
You're crazy.
"He has the same perfection
without name. Throw it!"
"The name outside, I give my heart."
I'm coming, Julia. Wait!
- Julia?
- Romeo?
- Here I am.
- Where?
Romeo? Catch me, Romeo.
- Romeo!
- I come, Julia.
Andrea?
"My face hides the night mask,
my cheeks painted with blush."
Hello?
- Romeo, I love you.
- And I love you, Julia.
- Come on now.
- I don't care about Shakespeare.
Daddy! Andrea! Wait!
Dad?
Andrea?
Pauli? Do you sleep?
What happened, Pauli?
- Go away from here, Yvonne.
- No. Say what has happened!
You sure understand!
- He fucked her...
- The pig!
It doesn't make your father a pig.
He certainly knew that I like Andrea.
Maybe...
But it is Andrea's fault too.
She isn't a child any more.
He couldn't resist her;
the old man.
You wouldn't resist me...
If I really tried,
even if you love Andrea.
- Yes, I can!
- Shall we bet?
Leave, Yvonne.
You're used to doing it with everybody.
Not everybody... Only with
the ones I really want to do it with.
Come on, Pauli.
Relax now, Pauli.
- Sleep well, Pauli.
- You also.
Come in.
- Good day, Signora.
- Good day. Put it here!
Put it here, please.
Good bye.
Eat you must do yourself.
I know, it's difficult to be a man.
But be happy you are one.
Sorry. Can you give me the salt?
Pauli...
It's not salted.
Alex? Pauli?
Ralph!
Hello, Hildegard.
Where's Ralph?
I must speak with him immediately.
Come, my child.
Drink a cup of coffee first!
Don't be so hectic.
Come here.
You're here on vacation, you know.
You can't rush around
in my house. No one is stressed here.
Everyone here is a little crazy,
or lesbian, but not stressed.
I'm not on holidays. He just leaves
and I have to do everything alone.
One steals, one is pregnant and
the last is on holiday with the boss.
Here's some coffee.
Or would you rather like a whiskey?
Or a couple of baldrian drops?
Whiskey.
And tell the old man to hurry down.
How you talk about my Ralph...
He's not so old.
They have taken a siesta,
now that it's so hot.
Do you think the night in Verona
was good for Pauli and Andrea?
- It depends.
- What do you mean?
I don't know if you did well for
Andrea or not. I wasn't there.
I didn't mean it like that.
You always think just of the physical.
But you have also a nice time
with what I do, don't you?
- Yes, sometimes.
- Only sometimes?
- OK... I like it.
- There you see.
I only know that Pauli felt well
with what I did with him.
He has talent.
- He has great talent.
- He's my son.
When I think of him I feel
tingling in the whole body.
- He was very happy afterwards.
- Sure. It was the first time.
But Andrea was angry
and cried on the way home.
All well mannered girls have to cry
afterwards. Probably you did too.
Not me. I was happy
that it all went well.
- I didn't cry.
- Of course not.
Absolutely not!
Hi, cutie.
Ralph! Come down at once!
Oh my God... It's your wife.
- What is she doing here?
- Just let her shout.
Ralph! Where is Pauli?
- Your turn.
- I can't play while she shouts.
Hey you a cold sweat already.
Are you so terrified by your wife!
- Ralph!
- I must go down.
Go, then.
Come on!
- Don't play such hard balls please.
- Come on, run.
I don't want to any more.
Weird. It sounds so strange.
It comes from their wet bathing suits.
Maybe not so bad, anyway...
Not bad at all!
These are totally new sounds.
They could revolutionize the music!
Can you move your buttocks
a little to the left, Miriam?
- Wow?
- Yes, go on!
A bit higher, ladies.
It's still missing something...
There we have the tone!
A little stronger, Silvana.
Higher, Miriam.
I will, if you allow it, at this moment
be third in this happening.
The third, the third
She makes me drunk.
Who or what has failed?
It seems like it's you.
- Where are the pass sheets?
- In the car. I'll get them later.
- You had a bad time.
- Not any more now.
- We'll talk about it in the morning.
- Tomorrow morning?
Yes... I'll stay a couple of days.
I'd like meet Pauli also.
Paul leaves tomorrow morning.
And who takes care of the office?
- Hey, little Hildegard.
- Hey, old whore.
- Stop it!
- But I'm right. Huh?
I'm sorry, I'm drunk.
The old witch gave me a proper drink.
While you had siesta... Siesta.
Where's Pauli? I want to see my son.
Pauli plays tennis with Andrea.
Pauli plays tennis with Andrea.
Or Andrea plays with Pauli's penis.
I'm tired of this.
And soon it starts to rain.
Can't you continue?
- I got a blister here.
- That's no excuse.
- And then I hit myself here.
- So foolish.
It starts to rain.
Inside with you, children!
- Come on, Hildegard.
- I can walk alone.
Okay, my pigeons.
We go, muses and delights.
- Stop it, Pauli. Aren't you leaving tomorrow.
- That's why.
Go ahead, go ahead, wild knights...
Go ahead, take me away
from Lesbos' beaches...
Go ahead, go ahead, wild herd.
Because the hunger's
burning in my body...
Let's find Grandma's pots...
And prepare us a tasty meal...
After the fifth course
my muse kisses me...
And I throw myself again
over my stringed game...
I love you, Pauli.
And I love you.
Where's Pauli?
The boy's probably lost in company.
- I want to meet him before he leaves.
- He'll certainly come soon.
Ralph, you can't allow her
to drag our child into the shit.
- Relax, Yvonne.
- She shall leave the house at once.
She'll go to Frankfurt tomorrow
and clean up at 'Goldener Hirsch'.
It's perhaps the best way.
Hildegard needs to rest.
I also need a rest after this.
She'll take the same train as Pauli.
I like to be with Pauli.
He fucks so good.
You pig!
We go inside and announce
that we love each other.
And that we'll marry. We scream it to
your father, Yvonne and the others.
OK, come on!
- Enough, Hildegard!
- I'm not a sexmashin!
Stop it!
Stop it, Yvonne. Pack your stuff,
we'll talk about it later.
Bastard. You'll beg for mercy.
Don't wet yourself now.
- Will you tell them that we are in love?
- Of course. We'll show them.
- Stand still.
- She needs to leave, otherwise I'll go.
No, I won't walk in there.
It seems that Mom is here.
- I'm going home.
- Yes, maybe that's best now.
Hope we'll meet again next year.
- Yeah, maybe next year.
- Ciao, Pauli.
- Wanna dance?
- Please.
What a man.
