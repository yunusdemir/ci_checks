Hey. My man.
Hey, you sellin'?
'Cause i got 20.
What do i get...
For 20?
Hey, man. What do you think,
You're the only pharmacy
In town, man?
[ loud chattering ]
[ man ]
This information is basic...
To the understanding
Of 20th-century thought
And civilization.
Charles darwin's theory,
"natural selection"--
A general description?
Anybody?
[ chattering continues ]
- we went over all of
This material yesterday.
- yo, kerrigan.
I got your natural selection,
My man.
How 'bout i naturally select
To walk out of this
Boring-ass classroom.

Whoo! Outta here!
Oh.
[ groans ]
Mr. Kerrigan?
Louis?
Maybe it's not such a good time.
I-i-i can come back.
Nah. No better or worse
Than any other time.
No, no.
Come on in, louis.
Excuse me. It's been
A rough morning.
So, the last
I heard,
You were off on the great
South american crusades,
Training our stalwart
Indigenous troops...
How to fight
The malignant cartels.
I spent four years fighting
A lot of bureaucracy
Is what it comes down to.
Now i'm back, and, uh,
I'm just trying to find
Square one all over again.
And you think maybe
I can possibly help?
Kid, you're in
Serious trouble.
Come on. Let's go down
To the feeding grounds.
[ kerrigan ]
What do you think of these?
They installed them
A couple of years ago.
Too many kids
Were getting high,
Thinking they were superman.
Either that or they were
Just throwing each other
Off the third story.
Hello.
Hiya.
How ya doin'?
Janitors got tired
Of scrapping 'em
Off the floor.
â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª [ man rapping,
Lyrics indistinct ]
â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª [ continues ]
I signed on to be
A schoolteacher, louis,
Not a zookeeper.
I'm tired.
I'm tired of trying
To lead the horses to water,
And i and everyone else
Knows they're not gonna drink.
Mr. Kerrigan, people like you
Do not just up and quit.
They stick around
And keep people like me
From quitting.
There was a time,
Young mr. Stevens,
When there were
Some students, like yourself,
Who were worth saving,
But... That's in
The past tense.
Take a look around you
At our current student body.
Seventy-five percent of them
Are packing weapons.
Forty-five percent are high.
Eighty-one percent are living
In one-parent families.
Is it any mystery
That 12% of the students...
Who come to lincoln high school
Go full term and graduate?
Well, what about those 12%?
What about the peasants?
The ones who wanted
To plant sweet potatoes
And not coca leaves.
I don't see you re-upping
For another four years.
No, i guess you don't.
Sorry.
I'm sorry i came here
In the first place.
â™ªâ™ª the babalu bad boy
The babalu bad boy â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª
[ students shouting ]
[ shouting continues ]
[ students groan ]
You'll be selling
The product,
Or you'll be sorry.
Now, pick it up!
[ girl ]
Aw, man!
[ boy ]
You better pray.
- [ boy ] shay should just
Go ahead and--
- [ girl ] shay, get up, man.
[ laughing ]
Just having a little
Family problem here,
Teach.
Little brother here
Forgot to finish
His homework last night, eh?
[ man laughing ]
Why don't you
Let the kid go?
I just told you.
This is family matters.
None of your damn business.
Who is this?
First of all,
I ain't a teacher.
Oh.
Second,
I'm in a real shitty mood.
[ students ]
Ooh!
And third, no law says
I can't make it my business.
So let the kid go!
Well, me man,
You just made it
Your damn business.
Get him.
[ students clamoring ]
Come to me.
Yes.
Boss,
Look at me.
Back! Get back!
Aaah!
- yeah, mon!
- come on!
[ boy ]
Do it again! Get him!
Good, good, good!
[ cheering ]
Yeah, yeah!
Get him!
- [ students groan ]
- come on! Get up!
Yeah. Yeah!
Come on!
[ cheering ]
[ students ]
Oh!
[ boy ]
Unreal!
- [ louis yells ]
- [ cheering ]
[ whistling ]
[ boy ]
He got kicked
Right back to jamaica!
Louis, do you know
What you just did?
[ cheering, whistling ]
You did something none of us
Professionals have been able
To do for the last five years.
You got their attention!
Hey, hey! All right! Hey!
These kids are no strangers
To violence.
It's been a part of their lives
Since the day they were born.
Look how they responded
To louis...
When he threw
Those dealers off campus.
And so by teaching them this,
Uh, this brazilian kung fu--
Capoeira. Capoeira.
Yes, thank you-- we will be
Channeling their hyperactive,
Hormone-driven energies
Into something constructive.
That's the idea.
Let me
Get this straight.
You propose we scrape
The bottom of the barrel
For 12 of our worst kids.
Students who are
Without redemption,
Who are prime dropout material.
And in lieu
Of their gym classes,
Young lawrence here...
Louis. My name is louis.
Teaches them
This stuff,
And hopefully--
It'll show them
Some respect.
Give 'em something to
Strive for, to work for.
Gentlemen. Gentlemen!
Listen to what
We're being sold here, people.
Teach violence
To violent kids.
We've been told
That this young man...
Has just returned
From military service
In latin america.
Doing what, pray tell?
Trainingdeath squads?
Now, there's a fine role model
For our disaffected youth!
Mr. Kerrigan,
We tried.
It's not gonna work.
Louis!
Wait, wait, wait.
Hang on
A second.
I know louis.
We were both students
At lincoln together.
When he was
A freshman and a sophomore,
He was a troublemaker,
Going nowhere like most
Of the kids in this school.
But someone
Turned him around.
His 11th-grade
Social studies teacher.
Now i think
He's back to try
And return the favor,
And if this is a last
Desperate attempt
To help these kids,
Because what we're doing
Is not working,
I think it might
Be worth a shot.
What have we
Got to lose?
Hey, dianna.
Dianna, whoa.
I just wanted
To say thanks.
Thanks for
Talking me into it.
You're welcome, louis.
Can i help you carry
Something? Your books?
Thanks. We're not
In high school anymore.
No, we're not,
And we shouldn't
Act like it.
So i can take you
Someplace nice now.
Look. You're not
Getting it, are you?
I liked your proposal.
I thought it was fresh
And offbeat.
Thanks.
I doubt it's gonna work,
But at this point, i don't care.
I'm willing
To try anything.
But just don't think
That my support was based on
Anything other than those kids.
That's all you should expect.
Hector.
SiÃ­Ã­, mi amor.
Will you help me
With these?
Thanks.
There's the front door.
Or maybe that--
Yeah, that's
The front door.
What's with the windows?
Well, we can
Take those out.
Yeah, that'll help.
Well, at least
We got ourselves
A dojo.
We got ourselves a disaster,
That's what we got ourselves.
Look at this floor.
Somebody's been using it
For a toilet, and i'm supposed
To do handstands on this?
Oh, louis,
We're in a firehouse.
There's got to be hoses
Around in here.
[ louis ]
A hosing ain't gonna do it.
This place needs to be nuked.
Fellas,
Your lease is up.
Look out!
Look out!
[ grunting ]
[ laughing ]
Well, let's see
What they sent us.
[ muttering ]
Let's go, guys.
Come on.
You must be kidding.
Eddie. Will you just
Line up down here, please?
Yeah, yeah. Whatever
You say, kerrigan.
Whatever you say.
Danny, stay in
The city limits,
Would you?
Come on, guys.
Line up.
Down to your left.
That's it, gentlemen.
Down to your left.
Yourleft.
The other left.
Shay, move on in here.
Right in here.
Just follow him down.
That's it. Hold it.
This line down here, please.
[ kerrigan ]
All right. Let me have
Your attention, please, guys.
As you all know, were it not
For this opportunity,
You'd probably be spending
Your time in detention
Or mr. Casper's gym class,
And if you'd like,
Those options
Are still available.
[ boy ]
Looks like shay's place.
You get my drift?
- [ tires screeching ]
- [ kerrigan ] oh, no.
Now what?
[ boy ]
Ooh! Mrs. Esposito!
[ boys making catcalls ]
[ boy ]
Look at that
Sexy mama!
Boy, did we ever scrape
The bottom of that barrel.
[ man ]
Mrs. Esposito.
School and
Juvenile records.
Ah, thanks.
Well, the vienna
Boys' choir it ain't.
But i'm sure in a month's time
They'll be saluting
And calling you "sir."
Make us proud,
Soldier. Ed.
I'm sticking my neck out
For you. Do not make me
Look like a fool.
That's gonna be
Pretty near impossible.
[ kerrigan ]
All right, fellas.
Let's go.
Into the firehouse.
Let's line up for roll call.
Everybody.
Everybody. Come on.
Hey, shay,
Looks like your house.
[ eddie ]
What a shit-hole.
[ chattering ]
â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª [ techno ]
Place is
Fallin' apart.
Those are rat holes.
Look at this,
Man.
Hey, kerrigan, you oughta
Condemn this place, man.
We could
Hurt ourselves here.
Okay, guy--
Donovan, would you
Turn that off.
- what?
- turn it off!
[ kerrigan ]
This is a class.
Oh.
[ music stops ]
All right.
Your instructor today--
Ormestre--
Is mr. Louis stevens.
Ooh.
Oh. The tough guy!
- he's a former graduate
Of lincoln high.
- he must be a loser then.
- [ laughing ]
- he's also a former
Green beret.
Ooh.
And he's not predisposed
To tolerating...
Any disorder the way
Some of your teachers are.
He has kindly agreed
To show us--
He's that punk that kicked
Your brother's ragged ass
Out on the lunch yard, man.
I'll do the same
To you, faggot.
Any day!
- hey, listen up.
- i think so, man.
- listen up!
- take your best shot.
Aw, i'll kick
His ass later, man.
You!
I want you
To turn that musicup.
I said turn it up!
Okay. Happy?
All right.
â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª [ techno ]
Yeah. I like that.
Incapoeira,
Everything starts out
With theginga.
This is aginga.
[ laughing ]
That's aginga.
- i know that!
- yeah, that's it!
Think you got it, eddie.
- looks pretty funny,
Doesn't it?
- very funny.
It's the basis
For moves like this.
Hey, man!
[ speaking portuguese ]
This doesn't seem
To be working now, does it?
You mind?
No.
Mr. Kerrigan,
You have that tape?
[ music stops ]
Now, this is
The realcapoeiramusic.
I recorded it in brazil.
It's a little different,
So keep your mind open.
â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª [berimbauplaying,
Men singing ]
Hey, man, turn that
Voodoo music off!
- [ cawing ]
- [ ululating ]
Give it a chance, guys.
Keep an open mind, huh?
I said turn
That shit off, man.
It's giving me
A headache.
Go back to the jungle.
Ooh!
You must think
I'm playing, punk.
Ooh.
[ eddie ]
Cut him up, orlando.
Do it,
Orlando!
Hey, give me that!
Where you going?
Let's dance.
[ shouting ]
- he's only human.
- [ boys shouting ]
[ grunting ]
[ boy ]
Get up!
[ groaning ]
Will you
Turn that off, please?
[ music stops ]
[ orlando groans ]
Okay, that's class for today.
Tomorrow i want everybody
To show up in baggy clothes,
No shoes and ready toginga.
[ kerrigan ]
That's it, guys.
You're dismissed.
[ chattering ]
What's your name?
Eat shit.
You want your blade back,
Eat shit?
His name's orlando oliveiras,
And he has no business carrying
That knife in the first place.
We're not technically
On campus, are we?
No.
Heads up,
Tough guy.
Louis, what are you doing?
Tomorrow
Baggy clothes, huh?
Louis, that kid has got
A disciplinary file
As long as my arm.
He's got a cousin
Named silverio...
Who runs one of
The toughest gangs in the city.
Mr. Kerrigan, if we don't start
Trusting them, why should they
Start trusting us?
Um, could i borrow this?
I mean, just for tonight.
Just don't forget
Where it came from, huh?
Promise.
You have a name?
Yeah. Uh, donovan.
Donovan.
See you tomorrow, donovan.
- okay.
- okay.
I hope you have
Another copy of that.
Yeah, i know,
I know, i know.
Trust them.
Trust them.
â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª [capoeirahip-hop ]
â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª
Thanks, mr. Stevens.
What? Oh, this?
Well, you see,
I ran your tape
Through a midi setup.
Your percussion and vocals
Are panned from left to right
On eight,
And then i filled in
The other 16 tracks
With some prefab brahms samples.
And then i added
Some reverb
And some delays...
And some
Custom-made sounds.
It's kind of like a blend
Of the old and the new.
I hope it's cool with you,
'Cause i would not
Want to offend...
Any of the ancientmestres
Or anything like that,
You know.
I think
They're gonna like it.
â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª [capoeirahip-hop,
Men singing, clapping ]
Danny.

Hurry up.

How to kick ass.
- [ boy chuckles ]
Shut up, shay.

You can'tginga,
You can't fight.
That's the basic of it.
But, uh, mr. Stevens,

Whoa, whoa. What? You wanna let
Your brother keep slapping you
Around for not selling drugs?
Or do you wanna learn
How to kick ass?
Today's your big chance, man,
Because tomorrow--
Tomorrow it's you and eddie

What do you got time for?
Running little errands
For your cousin?
Stealing cars
And chopping them up?
Yeah, teacher,
I do shit for my cousin.
Everybody knows that.
Cops know that;
School knows that.
I'm sure you saw it
On my files.
Oh, so now what?
You got something better for me?
You gonna pay my mama's rent?
Are you gonna feed me
With that jungle music, man?
Teacher, let me
Tell you something
About my cousin.
He don't play no jungle music,
But he takes care of business.
He takes care of his family,
And he takes care
Of his neighborhood.
You better go, man.
We gonna see you
In class tomorrow?
Hey,sacana.now, maybe
You don't hear so good.
He said go.
- now!
- [ louis grunts ]
[ shouting in portuguese,
Screaming ]
[ scoffs, chuckles ]
Look at this.
[ groaning ]
Oh, man.
[ chuckles ]
So, you must be the guy.
Eh,primo?
The one who teaches
Capoeira,eh?
You must be
The cousin.
Silverio.
So, tell me, teacher.
How much are they paying you
On the high school?
- enough.
- don't play with me,cu.
How much?
[ chuckles ]
I got a roof over my head.
That's all i need
Right now.
"a roof over
My head." ha!
You know, my friend,
It's been a long time
Since i met
A real-lifesanto.
A saint.
Right before my eyes.
In the flesh and blood.
Tell you what,santo.
[ groaning ]
[ silverio ] you see
All this useless garbage?
I need someone...
Who can take
These pieces of shit
And make men out of them.
If you can teach them
How to fight,
I'll give you
A roof over your head
Like you ain't gonna believe.
And probably all
The coke i can snort.
[ sniffles ]
Whatever.
I'm a reasonable man.
Just tell me
What you need.
You know what i need?
I need to get out of here
Before i puke all over
Your fancy shoes.
Excuse me.
Hey,santo.
Your interview
Is not over yet.
I still gotta check
Your qualifications.
See, you don't
Fool a man...
Who was born and raised
In the worst barrio
Of rio de janeiro.
We're gonna find out
Real quick...
Who's the realcapoeira mestre
In this neighborhood.

[ louis panting ]
You know what?
You're okay,santo.
[ panting ]
Get up.
[ men laughing ]
I say, "okay."
Which means
Not good enough
To train my boys here,
But good enough
To train myprimo.
Santo'sgonna teach you
The simple shit, and when
You're ready to graduate,
I'm gonna be
Your college...
To teach you
What they don't teach you
In the playgrounds.
He's my blood,
Santo.
I got big plans
For him.
Don't be putting
No crazy ideas
In his head.
[ thunderclap ]
[ thunderclap ]
I'd say going there
By yourself...
Was not the smartest move
You ever made.
Look who's talkin',
You waitin' outside
The fire stationalone
On a night like this.
Yeah, i'd say that's
Pretty levelheaded, huh?
Aaah.
Sorry.
So why did you
Wait for me?
'Cause i know that neighborhood.
And i know about
Orlando's family.
I tried to warn you.
Hey, you know me.
If someone says it's
A lost cause, i'm the
First sucker in line.
Uh-huh. Is that
What these kids are?
They just another
Lost cause to you?
This time
It's my backyard.
What does that mean?
It means that if i don't
Do something about it,
I've got to live with it.
We've got to
Live with it.
[ chuckles ] is this
That same self-absorbed guy
I used to date?
What happened to you
Down there?
It's okay.
How's your hand?
I don't know.
Let's find out, huh?
Oh-- god!
Louis, you're crazy!
- guess the hand's better, doc.
- take two aspirin, anddon't
Call me in the morning.
Wait. It's your turn.
I bet you can't even do
A handstand anymore.
You're right.
This is a challenge.
You gonna wimp out
On a challenge?
Swim, or do a handstand.
This is my choice?
This is your choice.
[ sighs ]
All right,
Mr. Show-off.
All right.
Does teacher need
A spot or some help?
No, no.
Just don't look
When i try one.
So you do need
A spot.
All right.
Just get back.
Drumroll, please.
Oh, my god.
Oh-- grab me!
[ grunts ]
God--
[ grunts ]
Well, your handstand
Needs some help, but your
Back bend's pretty good.
Are you happy now?
Could be happier.
How?
Oh, my god.
Louis, what are you doing?
[ shrieks ]
You're crazy.
I know.
Dianna!
Dianna, there's a rumor
Being circulated--
By my own students,
No less--
About you
And mr. Death squad,
Who, guess what,
Turns out to be
A former boyfriend of yours.
Since when
Did you start teaching
Current affairs, hector?
Since you started
Piling on the fiction,
Dianna.
Look. What is going on
Down at that firehouse?
I don't think that's
Any of your business.
Although it probably
Wouldn't hurt for you to
Come down and see for yourself.
[ engine starts ]
[ car drives away ]
â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª
I wasn't expecting this.
This is very... Impressive.
So the techniques are
Mixed in with the dance?
And the rhythm. Yes.
- [ groans ]
-[ music stops ]
Great. They've learned
A more efficient way
To give each other bloody noses.
Apparently, that's not all
They've learned,
Senor cervantes! Look!
Ordinarily that would have
Led to a shooting,
Especially with those two kids.
Look at what
He's done with them.
And these are--
Thesewere
The 12 worst kids at lincoln,
The absolute bottom of the heap!
Hell, i'm ready to give him
Casper's entire gym class!
- let's do it.
- all right.
Granted, he's instilled
A small degree
Of discipline,
But let's not blow this
Out of proportion.
"out of proportion"? Like taking
This proposal directly to
The head of the school board?
- would that be
Out of proportion for you?
- what proposal?
The Capoeira Program,
Kerrigan. Citywide, at every
High school in the district.
God knows, if it works
At lincoln, it'll work
Damn near anywhere. You shut up!
Come on, kerrigan.
Get with the program.
It's all right here,
And they're gonna love it
When they see it.
What they'll want to know
From you, louis,
Is how you're going
To teach this
To1,200kids.
Meanwhile, if there's
Anything more i can do for you
And the class, just name it.
Uh, well, sir,
Now that you mention it,
I was kind of thinking
About a field trip.

To set up a tent, period.

So where's your partner?
If you're looking for
Mr. Last of the mohicans,
He's over there.
I was supposed to be
Working this weekend.
For your cousin?
Yeah.
Stripping cars.
It's good money, bro.
They'll find
Somebody else.
One thing for sure,
In my neighborhood,
There's always
Somebody else.
I'd like to think you're
Better than that now, orlando.
Yeah, right.
Better for what?
Stripping cars
Is all i know.
Oh, andcapoeira.
That's all your life
Is supposed to amount to, huh?
[ scoffs ]
Who sold you on that load
Of crap, or should i guess?
I've got some major news
For you, man.
This world can be about as big
As you ever want it to be.
Or as small
As your own tiny, little hood.
I'm showing you
Some choices.
You decide.
I'm here.
[ girl ]
Hi, tanya. How you doing?
Good.
Back to school, gentlemen!
Let's go! Hustle up!
[ dianna ] you got about
10 minutes before class starts.
Party's over.
Hey, look at this.
The childrens are back
From the playground.
[ chuckles ]
You had a job you were
Supposed to do last night,
You little piece of shit.
Silverio,
You're family--
And i respect you, man--
But... I'm not your slave.
Hey! Back off, man.
Hey, we got a little rebellion
Going on here, huh?
You starting to talk
That kind of shit
To your brother too, eh?
He ain't no brother
Of mine no more,
And he sure don't own me.
That's why you jamaicans
Are so weak.
No loyalty for the family.
I'm gonna show you
Something.
[ portuguese ]
Hey,primo!
You got me in
A bad mood already!
You're getting in that car!
He's not going anywhere
Except to his first class,
Which starts
In about five minutes.
Hey,santo.i should've
Known you were the one
Who started this shit.
Well, hello. [ portuguese ]
Stay on the bus, dianna.
Tell you what,santo.
You take my cousin,
And i'll take her.
[ men laughing ]
Mr. Oliveiras,
You'd better leave now...
Without your cousin.
My cousin, in case you
Didn't know, is not a student
Of this school anymore.
He's now working
For me full-time.
Was this his decision,
Or was it yours?
You know what,santo?
I'm trying to be
A nice guy,
But now you're really
Starting to piss me off.
A lot of people in this town
Will tell you...
Pissing me off is not
A smart thing to do.
[ portuguese ]
VaÃ Ã monos.
Hey, hey!
[ portuguese ]
[ chuckles ]
You want to play,santo?
Come on. Come on.
You wanna play with me?
Huh? Come on.
This time i play for keeps.
And this time
I don't play.
Come on. Come on. Huh?
[ siren wailing ]
[ siren chirping ]
Ha, the cops!
[ chuckles ]
[ dispatcher chattering
On police radio ]
Well, well, well.
What do we have here?
Mr. Oliveiras.
Why don't you explain
Why we shouldn't run
Your ass in right now?
Something about violating
A restraining order,
Not being within a hundred
Yards of a school zone?
Little family emergency.
I just gotta pick up my cousin
And i'm outta here.
It's your choice, lando.
It's your life.
He's my family,mestre.
Can't go against my blood.
We'll work it out.
I promise.
Excuse me, officer.
Just gotta say one more
Little thing to my homey
And i'm outta here.
You want a war
With me,mestre?
You're gonna get one.
Have a nice day, officer.
â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª
I still say we shoot
The little bastard.
Not good enough.
These kids are starting
To look up to this guy
Like he's some kind of a hero.
We need to make
An example out of him.
â™ªâ™ªâ™ªâ™ª [ continues ]
Hey, teach, what's up?
Excuse me.
Can i help you gentlemen?
[ man chattering
In portuguese ]
[ grunting ]
[ man laughing ]
[ gasps ]
Hi.
How are you?
[ portuguese ]
[ men ]
Ooh!
[ portuguese ]
Ooh!
So, where's your
Capoeira mestre?
[ silverio chuckles ]
You give him a message.
If he wants to take over
My territory,
He's got to give me something--
Something i want.
You think he's gonna
Give it to me?
No.
Then he better leave...
And never come back.
[ men ] ooh!
Go with yourmestre.
Bye!
[ laughing ]
Bye! Bye!
[ man ]ciao!
[ objects clattering ]
[ man chattering ]
Hey!
Hey!
Wonder who this
Belongs to, huh?
He's gonna kill you
For that.
One thing is for sure,
Old man.
Somebody's gonna die.
[ grunting ]
[ portuguese ]
He saw our faces.
Let him turn into toast.
[ portuguese ]
Adeus.
[ students chattering ]
[ bell ringing ]
Donovan, man, look.
Mr. Kerrigan's class.
[ girl ]
Fire!
[ students chattering ]
[ ringing continues ]
[ students shouting ]
[ boy ]
Get out, get out, get out!
[ gasps, coughs ]
Mr. Kerrigan!
Mr. Kerrigan!
Come on, man!
Come on, man!
[ coughing ]
You all right?
[ students shouting ]
[ coughing ]
I'll be right back!
Where you going?
Just stay with him!
You crazy?
[ coughing ]
No!
[ coughing ]
Donovan! Get your ass
Back here, man!
The whole place
Is going up!
[ yelling ]
[ siren wailing ]
[ people shouting ]
Stop that guy!
Louis!
Mr. Stevens,
I tried to stop him.
[ man ]
Forget it, buddy.
He's gone.
Lincoln high finds itself
Being consumed by
A bloody reign of terror...
That was unleashed
When the instructor...
Of an experimental martial
Arts program crossed swords
With local gang members.
Today, both students
And faculty members alike
Are asking themselves why.
Was the death of
A 17-year-old student
And the hospitalization...
Of two teachers
A fair price to pay
For a dubious program...
Which we now learn
Had no official authorization
From the city school board?
These are just a few
Of the tough questions...
That lincoln high principal
Donald cochran...
Will be facing when he goes
Before the board this afternoon.
You, out of my office,
Off of my campus!
If i see your face again,
So help me,
I'll have you arrested!
Escort him to the sidewalk.
Avoid the cameras.
Mr. Cochran, the program worked.
He turned them around.
You saw it--
Miss walker!
In case you haven't
Figured it out yet,
This kung fu business
Is over,
Terminated, banished
From our campus,
Along with this scum bucket
Who brought it here
In the first place!
What are you waiting for?
Get him out of my sight!
[ shouting,
Chattering ]
[ whistle blows ]
One, two, three.
One, one, two, three.
Two, one, two, three, four.
One-- what's the matter?
You got a problem keeping up
With the rest of the class?
Mr. Stevens.
You got a hearing
Problem too?
Just a second, okay?
Lando didn't show up today.
I don't think
He's showing up no more.
Hey, wimp. If anybody needs
This exercise, you do.
Well, mr. Capo-whatsis.
Correct me if i'm wrong,
But i don't think...
Thatyouare supposed
To be messing with
Mystudents anymore.
Okay, hotshot, let's go.
I gotta go now.
You watch out for yourself.
I hear they're looking for you.
You know who i mean.
Come on, come on, come on.
[ whistle blows ]
[ grunting, yelling ]
[ yelling ]
I ain't supposed
To be here.
Guess you know that.
Yeah. I guess you ain't
Supposed to be in school
Anymore either, huh?
Hey, i didn't have
Too much of a choice,
All right?
Yeah. I can see that.
Look. You gotta leave, man.
I mean, get out of miami,
Out of florida,
Far away as you can go.
"yankee, go home."
Where have i heard that before?
This time it's no bullshit.
They're gonna kill you.
This time it's my home.
This time i don't leave
Until it's over.
So how'd you find out
Where the car shop was?
Your cousin's
Quite famous around here.
So what you gonna do?
He's got an alibi
For all that shit that
Went down at the school.
Ain't one person
In that neighborhood
Gonna speak out against him.
They're either scared,
Or else they think
He's robin hood.
Cops can't touch him, and you're
Just gonna be one more dead body
If you go after him.
Yeah, like donovan?
He was your friend, orlando.
He was my friend.
Gonna forget about him
Just like that?
Man, i just don't want
To see you ending up like him.
You know what mr. Kerrigan
Says in his classes?
All that crap about
Only the strong survive?
Well, let me tell you
Something,mestre.
No amount ofcapoeira,
No amount of
Green beret bullshit,
None of that gonna make you
Strong enough...
To take on
An entire neighborhood
By yourself.
Then he'll just keep on
Being the master
Of the plantation.
Is that what you want?
Doesn't matter what i want.
That's just the way it is!
Unless we do
Something about it.
Anybody know where
I can buy ahotmercedes?

Get out of the way
Before somebody gets hurt.
And you-- i will deal
With you later.
Deal with me now,primo,
'Cause you ain't getting past us
Unless you hand him over.
You bad shit now, huh?
[ men laughing ]
I think
You're right,primo.
We're gonna deal with this shit
Right now, right here.
Should we get rid
Of these ladies, or what?
[ all ] yeah!
Yeah!

Just you and me.

All right.
Is somebody gonna start
Talking, or are we all
Gonna take a ride downtown?
Hey, you're that guy
From lincoln high school,
Aren't you?
Yes, sir.
-[ officer ] who's that?
- his name's silverio oliveiras.
He's my cousin.
He's the guy who started
The fire at the school.
He killed my friend donovan.
Are you willing to swear
To that in a court of law?
That's right, sir.
And you're fully aware...
Of this man's reputation
For intimidating witnesses?
That shit's over, man.
He don't own
This neighborhood no more.
