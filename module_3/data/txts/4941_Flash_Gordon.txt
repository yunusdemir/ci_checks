Ragbear
?
See?
Piece of cake,
And i barely broke a sweat.
Oh, your father
would have been so proud.
There we go,
there we go.
Ahh...
whoo!
Thanks for being here
with me today, guys.
It's a perfect day!
It's glorious, rankol.
The gateway to a new world.
Ready the probe.
Quickly,
before it fades.
Success.
<i>And finally,</i>
<i>The first ever
three-Time winner</i>
<i>Of the tri-City marathon,</i>
<i>Kendal's very own
flash gordon!</i>
Thank you.
Hey, flash,
nice job.
Way to go, flash.
We got a situation here
That i think you need
to be made aware of.
Dale's here.
Come on, that was bound
to happen sooner or later.
Where is she?
No, no, no,
don't look, don't look.
She's over there,
And, dude,
she's hot.
Hey, cronkite,
You ready to do this or not?
Yeah.
Okay,
here she comes.
Just be cool,
and remember,
You're the champion.
This is your day.
No one can take
this moment from you.
Thank you, dr. Phil.
Don't worry about it.
Joely lavant,
wiad-4 news.
Can we get a few
words with you?
Sure.
Hey, dale.
Hey, flash.
It's been a while.
Yeah, sorry.
Things have been a bit hectic.
New apartment,
new job.
I was going to call.
No worries.
You look incredible.
It's all just hair and makeup.
Could you
give us a second, guys?
So i've seen you
on the news a few times now.
You're a...
you're a local
celebrity now, huh?
Just trying to
keep up with you.
You never had a hard time
with that.
So, um...
when did you get back into town?
Like you don't know
exactly when i got back.
Okay, maybe a few people...
everyone i know
may have mentioned it to me.
Anyways, welcome back.
Congratulations on the gig.
It's you
that should be congratulated.
Triple marathon winner.
Pretty amazing.
So, where are you living
these days?
Same place.
You mean...
yeah...
with my mom.
Nick and me,
we have a shop there,
And she...
she travels for work
Most of the time anyways,
So it works out pretty well.
Anyway, you want to do it?
The interview.
I mean the interview.
I know what you meant.
Yeah.
Come on,
let's do this.
Yeah.
I-I knew that.
She goes to yale,
Probably graduated
with honors.
She's got this great
career going,
And i still live
with my mom.
Do you know what that
makes me look like?
Yeah, a good son.
Your mom needed you,
and you stepped up.
That's what
a good son does.
Yeah, i know,
but i mean,
Her x-Rays have been
clear for a year.
It's time i got
my own place.
Yeah, if you move,
she sells the house.
If she sells the house,
we ain't got no shop.
You ain't movin' out.
Now, can we go get
something to eat?
That race wore me out.
I'll drop you off.
There's something
i got to do.
This is for you, dad.
<i>Go!</i>
<i>Whoo-Hoo!</i>
<i>Well, i'd say
we made a mistake</i>
<i>Calling you steven.</i>
<i>From now on,
i'm calling you flash.</i>
<i>Cool.</i>
<i>Cual es ese?</i>
Cual es ese?
<i>Oye abeja!</i>
Cover?
What do you mean,
cover?
You obviously don't
know who that is.
That's steve, a.K.A.
Flash gordon,
Triple marathon
winner.
Show some respect.
Fine, he gets in,
But you pay.
You are so
buying drinks.
I'll be in in a second.
Hey, i want to talk to you.
No, no, no, no.
Hey, hey!
Stop!
Pull over!
Freak...
who are you,
And why have you
been following me?
Please
don't touch me.
I don't like
being touched.
Tell me who you are.
I'm no one, okay?
So just let me go.
All right, we can
do this the hard way.
No, look--
Ah!
I'm not some kind of
freak, okay?
I just...
i worked for your father.
I was his assistant.
At the university?
No.
D-Did he never talk to you
about his work?
He was a physics professor.
You don't know.
Okay, so
know what?
About the portage initiative?
What's the portage initiative?
I'm sorry, i have to go.
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait!
Don't touch me.
Tell me
what's going on.
If you see your father,
tell him to trust no one.
My father's dead.
Yes, of course.
I won't bother you again.
So i ran into
this guy last night.
Mm-Hm?
Said he used to
work with dad.
Dark hair,
kind of wild eyes.
?
Your father worked with
a lot of people.
Sit down,
i'll make you some eggs.
Mom, i can do it.
I'm leaving for
atlanta tomorrow.
It might be the only meal
i get to cook for you.
Now, sit.
So this guy said
he used to work with dad
On something called
the portage initiative.
Oh...
he ever talk about that?
Um...
no, he didn't talk
about his work.
[Clears throat awkwardly]
Even if he had,
i wouldn't have understood it.
All those numbers.
I can barely balance
my checkbook.
What are you not telling me?
Nothing.
All i know
Is that he did some research
outside the university,
But, like i said,
he didn't talk about it.
What kind of research?
I don't know.
Well, did he leave
any papers behind, anything?
They came and took them all.
Who?
I don't know.
Please, steven,
Don't go poking
around in this.
This is about dad.
Don't you want to know
what happened to him?
I know what happened to him.
He was killed in a fire.
Then how come
they never found a body?
Let this go, steven.
I'm not asking you,
i'll telling you.
That project,
whatever it was,
Cost me a husband.
It won't cost me a son too.
Come on, eat your eggs.
What was that light?
Just watching some tv.
That wasn't tv light.
Go to bed, flash.
[Speaking spanish]
He says it looked
like a big bee.
<i>Vino de un agujero
en el cielo.</i>
<i>Tiro a rayos
de la luz de el es ojos.</i>
It came from
a hole in the sky,
And shot rays of light
from its eyes.
<i>No me gusta,
asi que yo lo tiro.</i>
He didn't like it,
so he shot it.
And that's what's in the bag?
<i>Si.</i>
Ah-Ah!
<i>Ciento para mirar.
Cinco cientos para tocar.</i>
He wants 100 to look at it,
500 to touch it.
Sounds like my last date.
We don't pay for stories.
<i>La cambio para
el boleto de la loteria.</i>
He'll trade you
for the lottery ticket.
Winning the lottery,
or finding an alien pod,
Which has better odds?
It's kind of a toss-Up.
<i>Gracias.</i>
Remind me never to take you
to vegas with me.
?????
Xcalibur lanes.
Ah...
so, what happened to you
last night?
You were supposed to be
my date bait,
And you bailed.
Something came up.
Yeah, like a dale-Emma.
It was not about dale.
Whatever!
It was about my dad.
Okay, this is weird.
Four people at
the xcalibur lanes
Just reported being
attacked by an alien.
Think we should
check it out?
What, is this
alien homecoming week?
You know this is going
to turn out to be a hoax.
Well, yeah,
but it'd be a great tease.
All right, grab roller,
let's check it out.
So apparently rv dude
is some scientist
That worked with my dad
on a secret project
Called
the portage initiative.
And that's suppose to
mean something to me?
It's french.
It means to travel over land
in between two lakes.
Hey, you got enough slack?
Yeah, i'm good.
So, anyways, apparently
it has something to do with
Subatomic dimensional
transference.
Whatever the heck that
means, i have no idea,
But that's what
the internet fringe
Seem to think.
Okay, and this is suddenly
important because...
because he never
told me about it.
It's likhe had some
secret life goig on.
Dude, he was a physicist,
And you were what, 13?
And you suddenly think
he's gonna sit you down
And discuss the finer points
of string theory?
You don't get it.
This guy was talking
about my dad
Like he may somehow
still be alive.
Look, this rv dude sounds like
He's a couple sandwiches
short of a picnic.
<i>[Dale]:
... stood seven feet tall</i>
<i>And shot lasers from his hands,</i>
<i>Was seen by several witnesses,</i>
<i>Including xcalibur manager
jack b. Kahuna.</i>
<i>Mr. Kahuna,
what can you tell us</i>
<i>About this experience?</i>
<i>Well, i'm just so grateful
i didn't get probed...</i>
hey, wait, that guy
in the background,
That's rv dude.
What's he doing there?
<i>Absolutely.</i>
What if this
is all connected?
What?
Okay, you're spending
Way too much time
surfing.
No, think about it.
Alien, rv dude,
secret project.
What if this
is all related?
Okay, that's
a pretty big "what if."
Let me throw
a smaller one at you.
What if--
And i'm just
putting this out there--
What if you just found out
that the girl
That you're secretly
in love with is engaged,
And you can't deal,
so you're manufacturing
A ridiculous excuse
to talk to her
In a misguided attempt
to win her back.
Wait, dale's engaged?
Please...
don't pretend
you didn't see it.
Her ring.
<i>This is dale arden
reporting.</i>
[Dale]:
of course it was nothing.
If the invasion had begun,
Don't you think
i would have called you?
Psst!
Hey, that guy, your hot ex.
He's here!
Flash? Is here?
I'll call you back.
I hope it's cool
that i stopped by.
I tried to calling you,
but your inbox was full.
Stop.
Before you say whatever it is
you're about to say,
I need to tell you something.
I'm engaged.
I probably should have
said something earlier,
But i didn't want things
to be weird for you, for us.
I mean, there is a lot
of potential for weirdness,
And i didn't want to ruin
your big moment,
So i twisted my ring,
Didn't say anything.
All right.
And clearly,
you don't feel weird at all,
And now i just feel stupid.
It's great seeing you, dale.
Hey, and congratulations.
Who's the lucky guy?
Joe wylee.
Do you know him?
What, you mean
as in roger wylee?
His son.
Ooh, fancy.
Not really.
He's actually
a pretty regular guy.
What about you?
Are you...
uh, no, no,
Um...
that's not actually
why i'm here.
I actually
came to ask you
About the bowling alley.
What happened there?
The falien story?
Falien?
Fake alien?
It's actually
my second one of the week.
They tend to happen in threes,
like celebrity deaths.
So, there was nothing
unusual there?
If you're asking me
whether i think
An alien came down
to knock a few pins around,
No, i don't.
All right, well, now i'm
the one that feels stupid.
What's going on?
There's just been some
odd stuff happening lately,
And i was hoping
it was all connected somehow.
Like what?
You know what,
Forget about it.
I mean, think about it,
there's no way
You're going to come all the way
from another planet
And go to xcalibur.
You'd hit the rock and bowl.
I gotta take this.
Hey, you.
What?
I'll be right there.
Hey, flash,
That falien?
It apparently just
liquefied somebody
At a mini-Mart.
So this weird rv guy,
where do we find him?
No idea.
That's the problem.
I'll be right back.
Oh, this is
a closed crime scene, no press.
I'll have to ask you
to follow me.
So,
what the hell happened here?
I've never seen
anything like it.
The dead guy...
what?
It's like he was...
i don't know, boiled to death
from the inside out.
Let me see the body.
? You don't want to.
Any theories about
the cause of death?
As crazy as it sounds,
some kind of microwave.
An oven?
A weapon.
The military base.
We're thinking
It might have been
some new type of gun.
Since when does the military
test weapons at mini-Marts?
Hey, dale?
Isn't that that guy
you dated in high school?
What's he
doing here?
Come on,
i'll introduce you.
Flash, i'd like you
to meet my fiance,
Joe wylee.
Hey, nice to meet you.
Pleasure.
I found
these footprints.
Obviously not a detective,
But they're dug in
real deep.
The guy must have weighed
at least 400 pounds.
Don't you think
that's kind of weird?
I appreciate the input,
But let's let the detectives
handle the detecting.
We'll let you get back to it.
We have to find
this scientist guy.
Shouldn't be too hard.
He had to get a degree
from some university.
I'm thinking early '90s,
maybe late '80s.
We'll check
the ivy leagues first.
Yeah, but we don't even
have a name.
We've got nothing.
We've got a face.
Oh, my god.
It's the 1989
parade of bad hair.
Aw, did we ever
look that bad?
Do not go there.
Yearbook photos
are bad enough,
But online
yearbook photos?
Work of the devil.
Oh, man,
We've been at this
for three hours.
I'm starting
to see double.
You might want to change
the strap on that thing.
It's looking
a little ragged.
This actually used to
belong to my father.
He wore it all the time.
Oh...
that's nice
that you have it, then.
I think some students
gave it to him.
He was guest-Lecturing
At this little college
in maine.
We spent
the summer there.
You don't happen to
remember the name
Of this little college,
do you?
Sure.
This is the address
from the website.
I can't believe
somebody lives here.
Well, this is his rv.
I told you he's weird.
So, joe seems like
a good guy.
How long you been
hooked up?
Six months,
And for your information,
we are not hooked up.
What's wrong with
"hooked up?"
It's an expression.
With implications.
I wasn't implying
anything.
Yes, you were.
I heard it.
Well, you can't hear
what's not there.
He's not here.
Maybe he's in there.
You want me to be upset
about you and joe, don't you?
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm not being ridiculous.
I know you,
And you want me
to be upset,
And i'm not upset,
so it's upsetting you.
You know what,
Spare me the nickel analysis...
because i am good.
Really good.
Good.
I'm good, too.
Good.
So we're both good?
Yeah. Good.
After you...
is anybody here?
Hello!
Whoa...
how did you find me?
Just want to ask
a few questions.
No, no, not with her.
She's that reporter
from the bowling alley.
I don't trust reporters.
And i don't
trust guys
With freaky guns
pointed at me.
Please,
this is about my father.
I need to know.
What can you tell me
about the portage initiative?
<i>It was a secret project,
funded by nasa.</i>
<i>At least they said it was nasa.</i>
<i>We'll believe anything
for funding...</i>
my god,
it's working.
<i>We were studying
gravitations in dark matter</i>
Using old school cyclotrons.
Basic stuff,
but the data we were using,
It was like nothing
i'd ever seen before,
But something went wrong.
Yes, there was a fire,
But your father,
He didn't die
in that fire.
Look.
Careful,
dr. Gordon.
No!
He was lost
in a dimensional rift.
We opened a door
That should never
have been opened.
Wait, what are you saying?
Are you saying he could still
be alive somewhere?
Mmm, ah...
i didn't think so,
But then three weeks ago,
Rifts started happening again.
At first i thought...
well, i hoped
that maybe he had been able
To re-Create
the experiment somewhere
To try to get home,
But then...
things started to come through.
So that guy who tried
to sell me the alien probe,
He was for real?
Yes.
And the alien
at the bowling alley?
And that's probably
just the beginning,
So, basically,
we're all going to die!
Hey, hey, calm down.
Okay, you need
to call joe.
He probably has
a number we can call.
There's got to be somebody
in charge of alien invasion.
No, no.
No one can know about this.
Okay, first of all,
this isn't happening,
And second, if it was happening,
It's not the sort of thing
That you could handle
on your own.
We have to. The more people
who know about this,
The more danger
we're in.
Look, uh...
this is us, okay?
Happily
blowing bubbles
In our cozy
little dimension,
And someone out here
Just started
swinging a hammer at us.
All the more reason
to tell somebody.
No, no!
Because if we do,
It's only
a matter of time
Before we build our own hammer.
Trust me, i know.
They're already trying.
Do you know
what a phase-Change is?
It's what happened
during the big bang.
Pure energy converted to matter,
created the universe.
In 10/100ths of a second,
everything that was...
whoosh!
...wasn't,
And that's what'll happen again
If we start poking holes
between dimensions.
Oh!
Ah...
so, what are we
supposed to do?
We're just going
to have to deal
With whatever comes through
on our own.
And how do you suggest
we do that?
Well, i've been working on
a few things, okay?
Like this proton gun.
But it's only got
enough charge
For one shot,
And it might not work.
I feel better already.
Steven, is that you?
So basically you're saying
That there's an alien
running around
Terrorizing bowlers,
and we have to find it
And shoot it
with that thing?
Yes, and make sure
That no one else
finds out about it.
So what does
this alien want?
And why would it
come to kendal?
I mean, why not
new york or dc?
The only connection it would
have to kendal would be...
my father.
<i>Hello, flash.</i>
<i>I need to find
the imex.</i>
Do you know where it is?
Imex? Mom, what are you
talking about?
Your father,
He used to have an imex.
I need it.
Mom, are you all right?
You sound a little weird.
Is there somebody there
with you?
<i>I'm fine, flash.</i>
Just tell me
where the imex is.
<i>I don't know, mom.</i>
Something's wrong.
She just called me flash.
But she only
calls you steven.
What's going on?
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
Don't worry about me.
Goodbye.
Mom? You here?
Hello, flash.
Would you like some pie?
Mom, you're
acting weird.
What's wrong?
I'm fine.
What kind of pie
Did you bake me, mom?
Just one pie,
For my sweetie-Pie.
And how big's this pie?
A nine-Inch pie.
I think i should eat this pie
by myself.
Look out!
Quick, shoot him!
I'm trying!
It's stuck!
What are you waiting for?
Shoot him!
I'm having issues.
Issues?
Take that!
Okay, it's working.
It's not working.
No, no, no, not the blender!
My mom will kill me!
Watch out, flash!
Rolling pin,
that's good!
Hey...
hey,you okay?
I'm fine.
The last thing i remember,
I was putting away the groceries.
Yeah.
Ooh...
neck's a bit stiff.
Ooh...
wait,where are you going?
I'm going to make myself a cup of tea.
I've got a 10:00 to atlanta,
I still have to pack, and i...
hey,i got a better idea.
Why don't i get you the tea,
And you head upstairs and lay down for a while?
Okay,thank you.
So she feels fine,
And she doesn't remember a thing.
Sorry about the blender.
She'll get over it.
Looks like he left something behind.
I think it's some kind of tracking device.
What is it?
My father's driver's license.
You're right.
It's definitely tracking something.
Are you sure this is a good idea?
I don't know.
This is it.
I don't feel very good about this.
Look,it's starting to blink faster.
What does that mean?
It means we're getting closer.
Closer to what?
I think we're about to find out.
What is that?
That would be a rift.
It's exactly like the one your father was lost in.
You mean he might be on the other side of that thing?
Don't even think about it.
That thing, whatever the hell it was,
Had my father's driver's license.
If he's over there, i have to find him.
That would be suicide.
You don't know that.
But it's a reasonable assumption.
Look,it's fading.
This might be my only chance.
No!
This is insanity.
You don't know what's over there,
If you can come back.
You can't do that to your mother,
And what about nick?
I mean,what about...
what?
Forget it.
Dale,i have to do this.
I don't care.
Hey...
oops.
Where are we?
I have no idea.
<i>Triumphant victory  requesting port assignment.</i>
<i>Approaching with notribs.</i>
<i>Triumphant victory  cleared for docking.</i>
<i>T&r standing by for incept.</i>
It's all my fault.
It's not your fault. It was an accident,
And we're going to be fine.
Fine?
We are captives on an alien planet.
You can't just say things are going to be fine.
I can,and am, because you know why?
We're going to keep smiling,
And people are nice to people who are smiling.
That's it? That's all you've got?
Smiles?
Hi. I'm flash--
Silence!
These are the notribs?
Ow?
Where are your attribution keys?
The thing is,
We're not from around here,
So i actually have no idea
What you're talking about.
Is there someone in charge we could talk to?
See? We're going to be fine.
We'll find this guy, ask about my dad,
See if he knows anything.
Looks like a nice enough guy.
Where are they taking us?
I promise, it's going to be okay.
Just keep smiling.
I don't think
This is the way to the guy in charge.
What now?
Now...
now we stop smiling.
Our herbs are withering in the fields.
If we do not get an immediate supply of source water,
They will perish,
And thousands who rely on our remedies
Will die when the sickness comes,
Most of them children.
I am not without sympathy,luna.
Nobody likes a dying child,
Which is why i have generously offered to provide you
With all the source water you need
At last cycle's rate.
And triple the transfer fees.
You know we cannot afford that.
The state of omadrian coffers is not my concern.
Well,the state of your people should be.
I will remind you
That if they are dead, you will have no one to tax.
Reduce omadrian transfer fees
To last cycle's rate.
Thank you.
We will of course expect full payment
Plus recompense next cycle.
I can't be seen to favor any particular canton.
Bad for stability.
I'm sure you understand.
Burn and salt a few of their fields.
If we don't keep the price of their cures up,
They'll never settle their debts.
Ah...
kind of you to join us,rankol.
Bring them to me at once.
Away!
All of you,away!
Hi. I'm flash.
This is my friend,dale.
We're from earth. Where are you from?
I think he's hungry.
You got any gum?
Pocket, pocket,pocket.
Huh?
Ah...
no,no,no...
no,don't swallow.
Chew. Chew.
Yeah,chew.
Show him.
Okay.
Ah...
yeah.
Uh-Huh?
Is that what i think it is?
I think he's smiling.
You notribs will come with us.
Good luck,buddy.
They must have retrieved this from our thrall.
Which means it failed to locate the imex.
I knew it was a mistake
To send a construct to do this job.
Ow!
You're hurting me.
Release them immediately.
My humblest apologies.
My patriots can be somewhat...
overzealous at times.
I am ming.
Welcome to nascent city.
All of this must be rather overwhelming for you,
But i must say,
You're holding up well.
I'm dale...
arden.
I'm flash.
Flash gordon.
We're from earth.
We came through
Some sort of rift in space.
A rift in space?
Fascinating.
We have so much to discuss.
So,you know about earth?
There are few corners of the galaxy
That we do not know about.
This is rankol,
My chief scientist.
Welcome to mongo.
This rift?
Tell me about it.
This...
thing,
Came to my house
Looking for something called an imex.
We believe it belonged to my father,
Dr. Lawrence gordon.
We think he's lost here.
Does that name mean anything to you,rankol?
There were stories of a man from the stars,
But that was a long time ago.
Yes,it would have been about 13 years ago.
That must be my father.
If so,i'm afraid your journey has been in vain.
Outside of my beautiful city,
Mongo is a dangerous place.
You would not have survived
If my patriots hadn't discovered you when they did.
So,what are you saying?
Few survive long in the banelands.
If the turin don't get you,
The deviates will.
No,no,i can't believe that.
My father must be here. I can feel it.
One can always hope,
And we will do all we can to help you find him.
This imex that you mentioned,
It might help us to know more about that.
That thing,
It was you who sent it to my house,wasn't it?
You're the ones looking for the imex.
Guards.
Listen,i just want to find my father.
Please!
Please,if you could just tell me if he's alive.
Please, just let me know.
Tell me!
He's all yours.
Do whatever it takes, but find the imex.
And the female?
Have her cleaned and sent to my chamber.
This isn't good.
Yeah,definitely not good.
Now...let's begin shall we?
Where's dale?
Your companion is fine.
And why should i believe you?
Because right now,
I'm the only friend that you have.
I want to see her.
You're hardly in a position to make demands,
But i do like your spirit.
Hey,what are you doing?
Enough questions.
Now it is time for answers.
Where is the imex?
I already told you,
I don't know.
Did you know
That the human eye has no nerve endings in it?
It's true.
I find it fascinating
That something that is so perfect,
So vital,
So exquisite in design,
Could so completely lack feeling.
Yeah,that really keeps me up at night,too.
Not so,however, the tendons behind the eye.
Those are some of the most sensitive
In the entire human body.
Now...
i'm going to ask you again,
And you are going to give me an answer.
It would be best if you didn't lie,
But then,that decision is really up to you.
Where is the imex?
What's an imex?
Oh,well.
I did try.
So,where am i?
You're in the benevolent father's chamber.
I have to say,he didn't seem that benevolent to me.
You should be happy.
This is a great honor.
Is my friend flash
Going to be at this audience with ming?
[Giggling]
This is a private audience.
Oh,no,no.
No,you can tell him i appreciate the offer,
But i'm engaged.
To a cop.
Don't worry.
I'm going to place this in your ear.
Its music will cause a waking sleep,
And you won't remember a thing.
I promise, it won't be so bad.
In any case, it won't last long.
[All giggling]
He's pleased.
This is good.
Put this in your ear.
It's time.
[Flash screaming in pain]
Your pain reveals the truth.
You don't know where it is.
You don't even know what it is.
I'm sorry that it's come to this.
I'll have to do an image scan of your brain.
We so often have seen things
That we aren't even aware of.
W-What are you doing?
It would be best if you closed your eyes.
Dale,is that you?
My name is chanza.
I'm one of ming's abetts.
They're talking about you.
Is it true you're from another world?
Yeah. Yeah,i'm from earth.
If i help you escape, can you take me there?
If you get me out of here,
I'll take you anywhere you want to go.
Here... put this on.
But i must say,
A little torture looks good on you.
Come on,let's go.
We have to hurry.
Yeah.
Right,going to need my ticket home.
This will come in handy.
This way,
And we'll have to move quickly.
It won't be long before he finds out i'm gone.
I got to go look for dale.
Don't worry about her, she's fine.
Ming treats his courtesans very well.
His-His what?
His courtesans! Wait! Where's dale?
We have a chance to get out of here alive,
But only if we go right now.
If we stay around rescuing people,
We'll never escape.
You can do whatever you want, but i'm going to find dale.
Now,where is she?
Guards!
<i>[Voice]: the benevolent father</i>
<i>Unites all tribes.</i>
<i>Honor the code,  honor yourself.</i>
<i>Obedience  is the father of peace.</i>
<i>Obedience--</i>
Dale!
Flash!
Thank god you're all right.
What happened to you?
I had a ming make-Over.
I was supposed to be tonight's entertainment.
Fortunately,i found a stand-In.
I was just coming to rescue you.
No,no, i was coming to rescue you.
Correction, i'm rescuing both of you.
Come on.
Dale, this is chanza.
She's one of ming's slave girls.
We're taking her to earth with us.
Well,we better get going.
He's about to be one very despondent despot.
What about my father?
Oh,no,no,no, we have to leave right now.
But this might be the only chance
That i have to find him.
I've worked for ming for two cycles,
And i've never heard anything
About any man from earth.
Your father's not here.
I've got to be sure.
Do you know what ming does
To runaway courtesans?
He sells them to the turin as pleasure slaves.
Is that what you want for your friend?
Down this way!
No,i'll come back on my own and find him.
Come on,down here.
What is this place?
It's part of the water plant.
All the water on mongo is contaminated.
If you drink it, it slowly kills you.
The only good water comes from a well below the city.
It's processed here before it's sold.
I used to sneak in here and play here as a child.
We should be able to get out
Through one of the empty water mains.
<i>The benevolent father  unites all tribes.</i>
<i>Honor the code,  honor yourself.</i>
<i>Obedience  is the father of peace...</i>
the prisoner!
Where is he?
He escaped,
And he took aura with him.
Find her!
If they fail,rankol...
i will be starting
With this one.
So,he's a water robber baron?
That's how he got the money to build this city.
Don't be so quick to judge.
Before him, millions died.
Now they live.
Ming saved this planet.
If he's such a hero,
Why are you running away from him?
Because sometimes being a hero
Also means being a tyrant.
Rift's this way.
Let's get out of here before someone decides to flush.
It's this way. Come on.
Stingers,and they're coming quick.
Whatever you do, don't let them hit you.
Let's go!
Come on!
We only have a few seconds
Before it closes.
Dale. Come on
I should never have let them go.
It's all my fault.
They're back.
Sorry!
There's zarkov. Come on.
What happened to you?
The first thing that we need to do is change.
I got to find the imex.
I'll take chanza back to my place
And get some new clothes.
I want to go with flash.
You're not going with flash.
Would somebody please tell me what's going on?
Oh,this is, uh,chanza.
She's one of ming's slaves. We rescued her from mongo.
Wait,wait, so you're telling me
That you brought an alien back here?
Uh,yeah. What else were we supposed to do?
Ming was going to kill her.
Oh,this is not good.
This is really,really not good.
You can't just bring alien slave girls back to earth
Willy-Nilly.
I'm not a slave girl, i'm an abett.
So,chanza,what exactly do abetts do?
We're trained to serve.
Let's go back to your place, and i'll show you how.
Oh,no,no. You're coming with me.
If she's an abett, then i'm costello.
Did you see her nails?
The girl hasn't done a day's work in her life.
So this imex thing, they want it pretty bad.
Any idea what it is?
Well,it must have something to do with the rifts.
Either that,or something involving the data
That your father was using.
I...
have really no idea.
All right,whatever it is,
We got to find it and get rid of it.
Let's get out of here.
All right.
You can put this on.
We'll take you shopping tomorrow.
<i>...septic tank-Cleaner  ernesto lupe</i>
<i>Had a day  he'll never forget...</i>
what's that?
It's called a tv.
Just push these buttons, and it will tell you
Everything you need to know about earth.
<i>...winning  the multi-Match game.</i>
<i>Oddly,he claims to have  traded the ticket</i>
<i>For a giant bumble bee.</i>
<i>I love america!</i>
<i>America!</i>
<i>America!</i>
<i>Whoo-Hoo!  America!</i>
You have got to be kidding me.
I'm glad you're feeling better.
I feel fine,
But,you know,i had the strangest dreams.
This monster kept asking me
Where the imex was.
Very odd.
The imex?
What's an imex?
Your guess is as good as mine.
So,uh...
where'd you go last night?
Uh... with friends.
I tried to get home, but i got stranded.
Stranded? Really?
Any particular friend i should know about?
Actually,i was with dale.
I knew it!
I saw you guys talking after the race.
I just knew it.
The way you look at each other.
It's so obvious mom... you're so in love--
Mom!
Dale's engaged.
Oh...
oh,not to you?
No.
Oh,i'm sorry.
I-I said too much,then.
But then...
what are the two of you doing spending the night together?
It wasn't about us.
It was about dad.
Dale's a reporter now.
She's helping me look into what happened to him.
Well,there's a shock.
Mom,i can't let this go.
Is there anything i could say that would make you stop?
No.
Well,there it is,then.
Just like your father.
Mom, i need to know
Is there anything of dad's left in the house?
There's a few boxes under the stairs,
But there's nothing there.
I've looked a thousand times.
I've made peace with this.
It's taken me a long time, but...
i've done it.
You do what you need to do...
but don't take that from me,
Okay?
Hey baby.Want to ride in my big truck? I just won the lottery!
Wow,hey.
What a crazy day yesterday.
It was nonstop.
What kept you so busy?
<i>Oh,just  this story.</i>
I'll tell you about it later.
I don't like this dress!
Okay,i'll be out in a second.
Is someone there?
Yeah
<i>A girlfriend came by  to borrow a dress.</i>
Look,i'll... i'll call you back later,okay?
What are you doing?
I need something else to wear.
You can't expect me to walk about in that sack.
This might work.
That was my prom dress,
And you're not wearing that.
What is that?
It's just a little protection.
Mongo is a dangerous place.
So you're telling me
That ming lets his servants carry weapons?
You don't trust me,do you?
Not for a second.
So why don't you just tell me the truth?
Who are you, and what do you want?
And don't give me some story
About being a runaway servant girl,
Because servants don't carry guns,
And they don't act
Like such spoiled little brats.
You dare to lay hands on me?
Don't you know who i am?
I could have you exiled to the banelands
In the snap of a finger.
%
I can't believe i didn't see it sooner.
You have the same cold eyes as he does.
You're his daughter, aren't you?
Who else would defend a monster like ming?
My father is a complex man.
I would not expect someone like you
To understand him.
What do you want?
I'm here for the imex.
There's nothing else on this planet worth having.
Except for one thing,
And i'll have him soon enough.
Flash?
Keep dreaming.
He wouldn't touch you
If you were the last woman in the universe.
Don't be so sure.
I always get what i want.
Hey,hey,hey.
I just got back to the lab, and we got another one.
Something came through about 10 minutes ago.
Somewhere near rock creek park.
All right,well, drive out there
Call me if you spot anything.
I'm going to find this imex.
Imex,imex...
be here.
This can't be everything that belonged to you.
No way...
this is the imex?
<i>Hello? I found it.</i>
The imex?
It's a timex!
It's my dad's old watch. I've been wearing it for years.
There's some sort of alien chip in the back of it.
Well,hide it,
Because that fake servant girl is on her way over
To try and steal it.
Chanza is ming's daughter.
Dale,it's joe!
Are you okay?
I've got to go.
Let's not complicate this any more than necessary.
I'll just take the imex
And go.
Aren't you going to at least tell me what it is?
It's a database.
Apparently it contains
All the knowledge of the universe.
So,what was it doing in my dad's old watch?
Don't know. Don't care.
All that matters is that i have it and you don't.
Maybe now my father will realize i can do more than look pretty.
My father...
is he still alive?
I'd love to stay and chat,
But i really have to be going.
Wait!
Hey,wait!
Take me with you.
Tempting as that sounds,
Don't think so.
I have to do this on my own.
All the knowledge of the universe.
What father wouldn't be proud?
Remain still, and you will receive no pain.
You did not remain still.
By order of rankol,
Primicounsel to the benevolent father,
You,aura, daughter of ming,
Are hereby remanded under my charge
And are required to--
Fine,fine. I'll come with you,
But i'm not leaving without what i came for.
If i see your father, i'll tell him heu.
Ow.
Flash!
There!
They're headed for the rift.
Ow, you're hurting me!
Quit pulling.
What are you doing?
I order you to put me down!
Give me the imex!
Ah!
Get off me!
Come here, come here,come here.
Drop it.
No,you drop it.
Don't.
Put it down.
Make me.
Nice try,though.
Useless earth weapons.
We don't have a lot of time.
Look,the rift,it's fading.
This could be your only chance to find your father.
Give me the imex, and i'll take you to him.
No,no,no, you mustn't.
Do you really know where he is?
Yes.
All you have to do is give me the imex,
And i promise, you'll be together again soon,
But we have to go now.
We only have a few seconds.
He'll be so happy to see you.
No,flash, no,no,no.
That would be a huge mistake.
Okay.
I'll give it to you.
No!
What are you doing?
No!
Here...
it's all yours.
You're a fool.
You will never see your father again.
Go tell your father his imex is gone.
Great.
Now we got another alien on the loose.
I have a feeling she'll be back.
Well,at least they didn't get the imex.
Although it's a shame you had to destroy it.
We might have been able to use it
To figure out how to stop them.
You think i'm an idiot?
One of my dad's old watches.
You get the alien chip, i get the watch.
Come on.
I'm sorry,father.
I had it,but flash gordon destroyed it.
Do you have any idea what you've done?
That can never be replaced!
If you were not my daughter,
I would have you stripped,
And i would hunt you for sport.
Lock her in her chambers.
I know you're out there somewhere,dad.
I'm going to find you.
When i do,we're going to dig this empty box up.
So...
how are things with you and joe?
I told him you and i
Were working on a story together...
about the death of your father.
It's true,
In a weird kind of way.
How did he take it?
It wasn't easy for him,
But he says he supports my career,
Wherever it might take me.
Is there anything i can do to help?
You could let me tell him the truth.
Not until we find my father.
Um... not ever, actually.
Unless,of course, you want to be the person
Who leaks the knowledge
That would inevitability destroy the entire galaxy.
Got it.
So,what now?
Well,all we have to do is save the universe.
That shouldn't be so hard,huh?
I'm beginning to remember
Why i broke up with you.
Uh,i broke up with you.
You did not.
I so dumped your ass.
Aren't reporters supposed to get their facts right?
'Cause i so broke up with you.
