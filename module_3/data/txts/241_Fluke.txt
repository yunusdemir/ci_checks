(feedback/voices overlapping)
(man) I ask you to listen
with an open mind,
forgetting for a moment what
you believe and don't believe.
This is how it started.
On a night like this.
On a two-lane country road
not far from here.
Hey, Jeff!
Pull over!
(honks horn)
(whimpers)
(siren)
(speaks Chinese)
(barking)
It's that same mutt causing
all the racket.
He just barks since
the other pups were adopted.
Tomorrow you can put him to
sleep.
For now, put him in the
can.
(whimpers)
(makes petting noises)
Come here, boy.
Uncle Jerry's got a special
treat for you today.
Stop that dog!
- (dog whining)
- Now...
Now...
Now you're history!
(car horn)
(shrieking and laughing)
(school bell)
( heavy metal music) *
(petting noises)
(petting noises)
Come here, little fellow.
Come on. We'll keep each other
warm.
Come on.
Come on.
(chuckles)
(man) These two connecting
circles. They mean forever.
It's beautiful.
- Will you be with me forever?
- Yes, Tommy.
Forever.
"My fancies are fireflies."
"Specks of living light,
twinkling in the dark."
Poetry is food for the soul,
little puppy.
(sighs)
We've seen better days.
Oh, well. Here, let's play a
little game.
Now...
See, we have three walnut
shells.
One, two, three. Three walnut
shells.
And we put the little jewel
under one.
We move 'em around. Move 'em
around.
There. Where is it?
Where's the jewel?
Good puppy. Good puppy.
OK. Here we go again.
Now, where is it? Where is it?
Good puppy.
Good puppy.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
Good puppy. Good puppy!
- He's such a smart little
guy. - Thank you.
It was just a fluke.
He's my little fluke.
Yes!
Fluke by nature, Fluke by
name.
(coughs and splutters)
I... I don't feel very well,
Fluke.
I think I'll take a nap before
we go.
(barking)
(male voice) Rise and shine,
squirt.
Don't let 'em catch you
sleeping.
That old dogcatcher gets up
mighty early
lookin' for easy targets just
like you.
Did you run away, or did they
pull that old
"dump the pup" trick?
You can talk?
Don't be goofy. I'm a dog,
pal.
But you're not barking.
What you're saying to me are
words.
It's a mental thing. It's what
I want you to know
and what you want me
to know.
- That's all it is.
- But... but...
You never met anyone
who can communicate?
- No, never.
- Well, now you have.
They call me Rumbo. What
about you?
Fluke.
Mm-mm.
I smell hunger with a capital
H.
Whaddya say we get something
to eat?
What about Bella?
I'm afraid Bella
had to move on, my friend.
You won't be seeing her any
more.
Hey, come on. It's chowtime.
Let's roll.
Rumbo, wait up.
I have to do something.
Woah, what have we got here?
Mm-mm-mm.
That's not the way
we do it, squirt.
Now, check this out.
Three paws down, firmly,
while number four
reaches for the sky.
- Oh.
- Now that's class!
Rumbo, help! Help!
Hey, squirt, we're goin' to
eat and you're takin' a bath.
Get outta there. Come on.
Come on. You can do it. Come
on.
There.
You OK?
Yeah. I'm OK.
Well, that's one way
of gettin' rid of your fleas.
What's that... What's that
smell?
I mean, I love it. I love it.
Hey, hey! Be cool. Knock it
off.
Ow!
Come on back here. Come on.
It's taken me years to build
this route
and I'm not gonna let some
rookie ruin it.
Now, you just sit there
and watch the master.
Hey, Rumbo. What's goin' on?
What'll it be?
Coming right up, sir.
There you go.
Now, who is this?
Listen, Rumbo, you know I
can't be feeding
all your buddies.
(Rumbo) Just let me handle
this.
Hey, Bert, how about something
for the pup?
I bet you want something
for the pup too, huh?
Ow!
Now, you two, out of here.
I got payin'
customers to tend to.
Listen up. You're gonna meet
the boss, but he don't have
patience with dogs,
so when he talks to you,
just wag your tail and go
into your puppy routine.
OK.
You are gonna love this place,
kid. Lots of nice shade
and soft places to lay.
It's the only place I know
you can chase tyres and not
worry about gettin' run over.
(Rumbo chuckles)
(man) Uh-huh, yeah.
All righty. I'll have to call
you back, all right?
(coughs)
Rumbo, where the hell
you been all night? Huh?
- What do you have,
a sweetheart?
- What!
- Just go to him.
- He called me a girl.
People make mistakes.
Now forgive him and get over
there and wag your tail.
- What's he doing?
- He's being affectionate.
- Well, it hurts.
- Well, love hurts.
What's this say?
"Fluke". What
the hell kinda name is that?
Ah, that's a nice dog.
(whimpers)
(Rumbo) Hey. Hey!
- What's going on?
- I guess I was dreaming.
- You were what?!
- Uh, dreaming.
I was seeing
pictures inside my head.
Pictures ain't got no business
being inside your head.
Next time you just growl
and chase 'em away.
Rumbo, have you always been a
dog?
What you talkin' about?
What else could I have been?
- I don't know. A human.
- A two-legger? Me?
Rule number one:
stop askin' dumb questions.
- It's just that...
- No "buts",
no "ifs", no "ands".
Stop talking all this
nonsense. It's sack time.
Good night.
Good night, Rumbo.
(Rumbo) Oh, man!
This is too good to be true.
- What are we gonna do, Rumbo?
- Take a good look, squirt.
We done hit the promised land.
- Oh, holy smoke!
- D'you think
this'll be all right?
All right? The guy
walked away. That's what I
consider formal invitation.
- (Fluke)
Everything smells so good.
- Mm-hm.
Mm-mm! (chuckles)
I knew I smelled pumpkin!
Hey!
(Bert) Yeah, so I'm sittin'
there just
waitin' for the light,
this woman bangs
into the back of my car.
$500 damage and
they raise my insurance rates.
Now you tell me if that makes
any sense.
(barking)
Fluke?
- Fluke. Cool it.
- (customer coughing)
- Don't mind that dog.
He's harmless.
- (Rumbo) What's with you?
There's something about him.
Can't you smell it, Rumbo?
That'll be $1.85.
All right. Thank you.
Oops.
Sorry about that.
Hey! Hey!
Get off me!
- Fluke, cut that out.
- That dog is vicious.
He attacked me.
You can't keep a dog like that
in a public place.
Hear what I said?
I heard you. Now go on, man.
You're making
the dogs nervous.
Go on, get outta here!
It's all right.
Everything's all right.
Shh, shh. It's all right.
It's all right.
Quiet. It's OK.
Sorry, pooch. I guess
you're gonna have to find
something else to read.
What's up?
You look like you
just saw a ghost.
- I saw someone
I used to know.
- An old friend?
I think... he's a murderer.
I hear they were your dogs.
My dogs never bit
anybody normal.
Well, that dog
ought to be put to sleep.
The dogs had their shots
and you won't die
from that scratch.
I could complain
to Animal Control. I could
make a lot of trouble for you.
Mike...
All right?
Now get outta here.
(Rumbo) Uh-oh.
I think it's time to split.
Hey! Hey, Rumbo! Rumbo!
Rumbo, get back here!
Come on in. Time for supper.
Daddy's back.
Hey! Hey, Rumbo! I see you.
You're gonna get yours.
OK, Fluke. You did your time.
(ringing tone)
(woman) Hello?
Hello?
Is anybody there?
- (licking)
- Who's this?
What the hell...!
Hey, Fluke! Hey! Fluke!
(groans)
Oh, these dogs.
Hello?
Hello?
- Hello?
- Hi. Who's calling?
You called, lady. Who you
lookin' for?
No, you called me. Who is
this?
I didn't call anybody.
The only other person in
this office was Fluke,
and he couldn't have called
because he's a dog, lady.
Rumbo, I wasn't always a dog.
And neither were you.
Right! Last week I was Snow
White.
Well, how do you know
who Snow White is?
It's something you knew
in your past, read in a book.
- That's ridiculous.
- You can't face it.
You're lying to yourself.
- I'm happy who I am.
- But I'm not.
I lived in a house.
I had a family.
I had a life once, Rumbo.
- You got one now.
A damn good one.
- I'm gonna find them.
If you're gonna go chasing
after humans in your head,
you're going alone.
And don't bother coming back!
Rumbo! Wait!
Get him in the truck.
- There you go.
- You're right.
He's just the right size.
(machine beeping)
(horn)
Forever.
(beeping quickens)
This is impossible.
(alarm)
- We gotta get outta here.
Can you walk?
- I think so.
Got it. Now let's roll.
- Rumbo, I can't see.
- Grab my tail.
Ow! Hey, easy with the teeth,
now.
Watch your step.
Here we go. Blue skies ahead.
- Shoot the dog.
- I can't shoot the dog!
Maybe we should
stop here for a minute.
They'll never find us here.
I think maybe I'll lay down
for a while.
- How are your eyes?
- A little better.
Rumbo, you're bleeding.
Listen to me, squirt. You stay
in these woods
until your eyes heal.
What do you mean? I'm staying
with you.
I don't think
I can help you
any more, squirt.
Rumbo,
why you talking like this?
You're gonna be all right.
Forget it. There's nothing you
can do.
Come closer.
Look,
we've got to stay together.
You and me, like always.
I can't make it without you,
Rumbo.
I had another dream.
My family's in danger.
Fluke, things aren't always
what they seem.
Rule number one: there's no
going back.
You can't be sorry about
what's been, squirt.
You got to be.
Please. I have to know.
Am I the only one?
You were a man once, too.
Weren't you, Rumbo?
Remember that snapshot
behind old Bert's counter?
That was me. In another life.
Bert was my brother.
Hm. I never really missed
being a two-legger.
But the sea...
Huh. I wish I could
smell the sea again.
All I know is you were
the best friend I ever had.
I'll miss you.
Rumbo, don't leave me.
Maybe we'll meet again,
squirt.
Next time around.
No.
Rumbo?
(sobs) No.
Rumbo's words kept
ringing in my ears:
"There's no going back."
But my family was in danger.
I had to go to them.
(bell ringing)
- We're gonna be late.
- Wait up.
(school bell)
Let's go.
(school bell)
Cool. Hey, boy.
(girl) Oh, sweet puppy.
(girl) Neat dog.
(engine starts)
Move it, pooch.
(gasps)
Get down. Get away. Look at
this!
- Mom, he's not gonna bite us.
- Get down!
Get away.
This dog is crazy.
Get down! Get away from the
car!
What is with this dog?
Brian, shut your door.
Shut it. Shut it.
What's wrong with it?
I've never seen
a dog act like this.
Mom, the windows are up.
He can't do anything to us.
Let's go. We're going home.
My god, it scared me.
(Fluke barking)
- It's the dog from school.
- No, no, Brian.
Don't open the door.
What's going on?
My god. How did he get here?
Uh, that's OK, Libby, thanks.
Mom, we have to feed him.
He must have run
all the way here.
Come away from the door. Come
on.
- He must be thirsty.
- Brian, we know
nothing about that dog.
Stubborn dog.
- Brian, come and eat.
- I'm not hungry.
There's a big
juicy cheeseburger here
with your name on it.
Come on and eat your supper.
I don't think I can eat
with that sad
creature staring in at me.
He probably hasn't eaten for
days.
All right.
He can stay for just one meal,
then he's gone. Deal?
Deal.
- Ah!
- I told you, Mom.
He's really nice.
- Good boy.
- (sneezes)
Bless you! I think he likes
us.
Do you think anybody owns him?
Well, let's see
if he's got a tag here.
Here it is.
Oh, there's no address.
It just says "Fluke".
Hi, Fluke.
Fluke.
Mom, I know we made a deal
and I respect it.
But can't we keep him...
just for a little while?
Brian, why don't you
get up off the floor?
Just until we find his owner?
You can't put him
on the street now. I mean,
he could be hit by a car.
You are just like your father.
A con artist.
Your father used to brag
he could sell ice
cubes to the Eskimos.
Well...
He can stay on one condition.
He has to have a bath
right now. He's filthy.
(groans)
Energise.
(imitates gunfire)
Gotcha.
Gotcha.
Fluke, have you seen Data?
Hey.
My dad used to do that.
(whimpers)
OK, Fluke, this is
your bed for the night.
I'll see you in the morning.
(gasps)
What are you doing here?
- See you later, Fluke.
- Come on, Brian.
We're gonna be late.
What's the matter, Fluke? Hm?
What's the matter?
You're a sweet boy.
You're a very sweet dog.
Playing with Brian,
doing things that I never
had time for when I was a man,
made me realise
how precious every moment is.
This was where I belonged.
Somehow, sooner or later,
I'd find a way to tell
them who I really was.
(clatter)
Brian!
(gasps)
Fluke...
Did you escape from a circus,
or what?
Tom looked so
silly in this hat.
- Ready, Brian?
- All right.
Come on, Fluke! Let's go.
* We're off to see the Wizard
* The Wonderful Wizard of Oz
* Because, because,
because, because, because
* Because of
the wonderful things he does
* We're...
off to see the Wizard
* The Wonderful Wizard of Oz
* Because, because,
because, because, because... *
(actress on TV) I love you.
More than you know.
(Tom) She was
even more beautiful
than I remembered.
I would have given anything
to tell her how
much I loved her.
More than fields
I have planted with my hands.
- I love you more
than morning prayers.
- Shh, Fluke. Stop whining.
- I'm trying to
watch the movie.
- It's OK, Fluke.
(vehicle approaches)
- (knock at door)
- Come in. The door's open.
- Hi, Jeff.
- Hi.
- No, Fluke! No!
- Jeff!
No. Fluke!
- Fluke, no!
- What are you
gonna do to him?
Please, don't hurt him!
(Jeff) Open the door!
You all right?
- Hello.
Give me Animal Control.
- Don't call them!
Brian, please! No, no,
we've got a dog that's going
crazy on our front lawn.
Brian, honey, go to your room.
It'll be OK. Please, go.
Yes, please.
6241 Willow Drive.
I don't know
what got into him,
why he's acting like this.
Well, something's
wrong with that dog.
- Good evening.
- What's the problem, sir?
Well, my friend's kid
brought home some stray
that just went berserk.
It bit me.
It's a large, brown mutt.
He might still be
around here somewhere.
I don't know.
- (officer) We won't
find him out there.
- (officer #2) He's gone.
- We'll call Animal
Control in the morning.
- Thanks for coming out.
If it happens again,
give us a call.
Well, there's
nothing more I can do.
- Are you OK? I mean...
- Yeah.
It didn't break the skin.
Don't go yet.
Why don't you stay for a bit?
(Jeff) They'll take him
to the pound.
I don't wanna call the pound.
You know what they
do to dogs there.
I can't do that to Brian.
- Don't whine. They'll hear.
- (mother)
Something about that dog...
- Brian?
- Yes, Mom?
- You OK?
- Yeah. I just need a Kleenex.
- 'Night, kiddo.
- 'Night, sweetheart.
Quiet, Fluke.
Come, Fluke.
Good boy.
(Jeff) Listen, it came
off the streets. You don't
know where it's from.
It just wasn't a good idea
to let him in.
I don't know
what came over him.
But he attacked me,
which means he could easily
turn and attack either of you.
Maybe he was
trying to protect us.
Brian has become attached
to that dog. I haven't seen
him this happy in years.
What about you?
Are you OK?
- I've been thinking
about Tom a lot lately.
- Me, too.
- (mother) You
think he's happy?
- I hope so.
I keep thinking maybe
if I'd... If I'd only known
what he was going through.
Listen, I thought that
we agreed we weren't gonna
do the "ifs" any more.
I think that
we've got to try to...
put this behind us.
I love you, Fluke.
Oh, hey, hey, hey!
Good morning, huh?
(coughs)
What's going on?
- You're so warm.
- Mom, I've gotta find...
Go back to bed.
I wanna take your temperature.
- But, Mom...
- You're going nowhere.
You have a fever.
Go on. Back to bed.
- Morning, Rose.
- You're early this morning,
Mr Newman.
- How was the trip?
- Work.
A lot of hard work,
Rose, as usual.
Well, I hear you're actually
taking a vacation this year.
Well, Carol made me promise.
Now, is that likely
to turn into a honeymoon?
Well,
if I had my way, it would.
How is she?
Much better, thanks.
She still misses him at times,
but we all do.
Yes, we do.
- Have a good one.
- You, too.
Jane, can you please
bring me that file?
- How'd it go?
- Fine, thanks.
- Is that it?
- Yeah, this is it.
No, I mean for the night.
My family's waiting.
And your wife called.
You have dinner
reservations at 8.30.
Listen, could you please
call her and tell her that I
won't be able to make it.
- Anything else?
- No.
- Thank you.
- Just don't stay
too late, Mr Johnson.
Good night.
Good night.
I see our brave
captain is still at the helm.
(phone rings)
(footsteps)
(phone ringing)
(Carol) Jeff, it's me.
But...
you called Tom's old office.
I did? Oh, God, I'm so scared.
- What's happened?
- I can't find Brian.
All I can think is that
he's out looking for that dog.
Jeff, he has a fever and
it is already
below freezing outside.
Listen, I'm leaving right now.
We'll find him.
Everything will be fine.
- Hurry.
- Bye-bye.
(growling)
I didn't care if I
was dying or not.
I'd had my revenge.
Then suddenly it came to me
and I remembered
what really happened.
I see our brave
captain is still at the helm.
Somebody's gotta work.
Especially in a business whose
profits are off 30%.
You've heard
we're in a slowdown?
Everybody's off.
So what's the cure? Everybody
go home at five
o'clock every night?
It's 8.45.
What d'you think
of the prototype? I asked
them to set it up for you.
- Did you notice?
- I read your specs.
It's twice as efficient
as any braking system around.
- But it's twice as expensive.
- It could save
thousands of lives.
Maybe,
but it's not cost-effective.
Not cost-effective! I never
thought I'd hear something
like that from you.
When we started, we wanted
to combine our talents to do
something positive.
Make money
by helping people.
We were young then.
It's different now.
I don't believe that.
Neither do you.
It's so easy for you
to criticise my life.
Do you have any idea
how many
responsibilities I have? No.
No, because you don't live
in the real world. You're
a dreamer. Always have been.
I'll take that
as a compliment.
We're not going
to throw money away
on your dreams.
This company is in trouble
and some has to take
responsibility.
No, our company
is not in trouble.
It's just a slow period
and you think it's
the end of the world.
Tom, what the hell
is wrong with you?
You've got the kind of life
that any man would envy.
I envy it.
- You've got a great wife,
a beautiful kid...
- Leave them out of it.
Like you do?
We're not gonna
develop this system.
As a partner and
head of design,
I say we are.
As a partner and
head of finance,
I say that we're not!
Not!
Hey, you've lost it.
I don't even
recognise you any more.
Come back here.
We're gonna settle this now.
Come back here!
Pull over!
Pull over.
Are you crazy?
You're gonna get
us both killed!
Let's talk about this, can we,
like a couple of adults.
It's useless trying to race
because you know I always win.
Tom!
Tom!
Oh, God. Tom?
Tom?
(sobs)
Oh, God! Tom...
Oh, what had I done?
Everything had been my fault.
Jeff had always
been a true friend.
Even after my death.
I had to help him.
Fluke.
Go find Brian. He's sick.
He can't stay
out in this cold.
Go find him.
(Brian) Daddy?
Daddy?
I can't find him anywhere.
Maybe from where you are,
you can see Fluke.
Help me find Fluke, Daddy.
Please.
Please.
Mr Grimes!
Hey, Mr Grimes! Wait!
Mr Grimes!
Wait!
I know where he is.
Fluke.
I knew you'd come.
(barking)
Brian!
Brian. Brian. It's Mommy.
Hi, Mom.
Come on.
- Fluke kept me warm, Mom.
- OK.
Let's go to the car. Come on.
OK,
put your arms around my neck.
Here you go.
OK.
I was dreaming, Mom.
I was dreaming,
and Fluke spoke to me.
He told me not to cry.
He said he had to go away.
OK, stay here and keep warm.
I'll be right back.
Come, Fluke.
Come with us.
Come on, boy.
Let's go home now.
Come on, Fluke.
Of course, I had to go away.
I loved them too much
to get in the way
of their happiness.
Jeff would be there now,
in a way that I hadn't been.
I didn't know how to live
as a man and I didn't know
how to live as a dog.
Now I understand
that life is something
to be cherished in every form.
So this is my story.
Perhaps I was made to remember
so that I could
share it with you.
And perhaps there are
many out there like me,
hiding behind the eyes
of simple creatures.
Maybe even
someone close to you.
(male voice) Rise and shine,
squirt. Don't let 'em
catch you sleepin'.
Rumbo?
Ha-ha! You didn't think you
could get rid of me that
easy now, did you, squirt?
- Rumbo,
I can't believe it's you.
- You better believe it.
Come on over here. Come here.
We've got a lot to talk about.
But first,
let me tell you something
about being a squirrel.
Rule number one...
