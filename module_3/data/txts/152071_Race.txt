Previously on the Amazing
Race Canada Heroes Edition...
Go, go, go!
Go, go!
...nine teams raced to Salt
Spring Island, British Columbia,
where a pie-eating challenge
proved to be no piece of cake...
Do you guys like pie?
...swallowing
all three express passes.
The express pass
is the only option.
All the teams are gone.
We choose to use
our express pass.
A high-tech,
precision roadblock...
Oh, yeah.
...had Courtney
veer off course...
You broke
the speed limit.
We are dead last.
...while birds of prey had
other racers tied up in knots.
I did it.
I just don't know how I did it.
And in a dramatic footrace
to the mat for first...
- Come on, let's go!
- Come on, Anna!
...the Mounties
came out on top.
You're teams
number one and two.
...while Todd and Anna's
third podium finish in a row...
Yeah, a gold,
a silver, and a bronze.
...secured their
position as the team to beat.
But a strong start...
We're on
the first one, ya!
...was not enough
for Joseph and Akash...
I figure I'll watch.
...as the volunteers were
left at the end of their rope.
I am sorry
to tell you this,
but you've been
eliminated from the race.
I'm so sorry.
Now, eight teams
remain as they race to win
the all-new 2018
Chevrolet Traverse Red Line,
a once in a lifetime trip
for two around the world,
a quarter
of a million dollars cash,
and the Amazing Race Canada.
This is Vancouver
Island's Cowichan Valley, and...
...today Duncan,
the city of totems,
will act as the starting point
as eight teams continue
their adventure on the Amazing
Race Canada Heroes Edition.
Taylor and Courtney won
the last leg of the race,
and will depart
first at 3:14 am.
Fly to
Jakarta, Indonesia,
the emerald of the equator.
Teams must now travel
the 13,000 kilometres
from the lush wilderness
of British Columbia...
to the chaos of Indonesia's
capital, Jakarta.
Located on the other
side of the world,
this island nation
is the largest
archipelago on the planet.
With more than 18,000 islands,
it has the world's
second-longest coastline,
right behind our
home and native land.
Caution,
double U-turn ahead.
We're going
international.
Ooh, are you excited?
Oh, this is the furthest
I've ever travelled in my life.
As RCMP officers,
we don't get a lot of leave.
I can't remember the last time
that we spent this
much time together,
and I, for one,
am having a blast.
It's gonna
be crazy, man.
Fly to Jakarta, Indonesia.
Nice.
Woo hoo!
Caution,
double U-turn ahead.
We feel confident.
I think the other teams
are realizing that we do
have a good chance of winning.
It's a good thing,
but it's also a bad thing
because it could put
a target on our back.
A whole new game
outside of Canada.
Oh, my god!
Aah!
Oh, my god!
We're going to Indonesia!
Oh, my god.
Indonesia, woo-hoo!
Jakarta!
Caution, double U-turn ahead.
Double U-turn ahead!
- Oh!
- Let's go.
Our secret
weapon really is
we have this puppy-dog attack,
which his like
we're non-intimidating,
but as we get closer to the end,
we're gonna attack!
Jakarta, Indonesia!
- Whoa!
- Let's go!
Jakarta!
Jakarta, Indonesia!
Oh, my god,
I'm so pumped!
So far, we've been
sixth, ninth, and seventh.
We need to be 1, 2, or 3.
- We need to be one.
- We need to be one, yeah.
Right here.
Woo!
A stinking double U-turn.
It would be nice to get up
to the top of the pack.
We're in last position.
I don't like it.
I never will like it.
Jakarta!
- We need Air Canada.
- Hi, there.
We're flying
to Jakarta, Indonesia.
Woo!
All teams are now traveling
across the Pacific Ocean
between Vancouver
and Tokyo, to Jakarta,
the capitol city of Indonesia.
When they touch down,
they'll make their way to
Fatahillah Square where they'll
join these ondel ondel dolls
in a traditional
Indonesian welcoming dance
to receive their next clue.
Let's go, go, go, go!
- Taxi, oh!
- Oh, wow.
Oh, my god, I'm hurt!
I've fallen!
Go, go, go, all the way.
We're off
to Fatahilla Square.
We've got
a good driver today.
Go, yes, yes, go!
Yes, go, go, go!
Yes, go, go!
I think
you're scaring him.
Fatahillah Square.
Do you know
where that is?
100%?
Aah, I can't believe
we're here in Indonesia!
- It's absolutely incredible.
- It's wild.
Oh, looks like
a nighttime marketplace.
Fatahillah Square.
This way!
Yes, we have a sign-up
for ondel ondel dancing.
We get
to the sign-up first.
This has never
happened to us ever.
First time ever.
Dyl, I don't want
to be number one, though.
Stop it.
Kwame's
very superstitious.
I noticed
a little pattern going on.
Chewy & Happy, all-male team,
signed up first,
the sea to sky gondola--
eliminated.
Akash and Joe, all-male team,
signed up first,
sky plane--
eliminated.
Maybe we should
sign up second.
Stop it.
Put number one.
The performance begins
tomorrow at 8 am.
Signing up
for the first performance
are Dylan and Kwame...
Performance one.
...and Leanne and Mar.
Get your
dance moves ready.
Watching the second
performance are Todd and Anna,
Courtney and Adam,
and Zainab and Monica.
And for the final performance,
Martina and Phil,
Nancy and Mellisa,
and Taylor and Courtney.
We are last.
Our cab didn't
know where he was going.
Well,
that was a gong show.
Ondel ondel is
a traditional Indonesian
welcome dance.
Very humbling for us to
start off our day with them,
with this dance.
Woo!
Route info.
Make your way
to Jakarta's old port,
Pelabuhan Sunda Kelapa.
And find
your next clue.
Oh!
Do you want to go to
that corner to grab a cab?
Yeah.
We are going to
Jakarta's old port.
We left
the square numero uno.
My friend, how do you say
number one in your language?
You can't speak English?
It could be bad.
Palabuhan Suda Kelapa.
Right here.
There's a clue box.
Route info.
Take a load off.
Known around the world
as the big durian,
Jakarta is famous for this
stinky tropical fruit.
Teams will now have to carry
load after load
of this painfully prickly
fruit from this truck,
as they navigate
these narrow planks
to fill one of these crates
on this pinisi boat.
Once all their durian
is onboard the ship,
they'll receive their next clue.
Mmm.
Grab a couple
by the stems, if you can.
Ouch.
They're prickly.
Ouch!
I've got holes in my arms.
Let's just take our time.
Let's go at a really
good pace, okay?
Yup, we do not want
to fall into this water.
Walk like duck foot.
Ah, this is crazy.
Really spiky!
Woo!
I haven't seen Dylan or Kwame.
They left before us!
How close are we, sir?
This cab driver's
killin' us, man.
We're definitely
not going the right way.
I'll tell you that, man.
Jakarta's old port.
Do you know
where that is, sir?
You don't know
Jakarta's old port?
Madool, we need you
to go to Jakarta's old port.
Good!
I've never seen so many
mopeds in my entire life.
Old port.
This is it.
Is there--
Can we go further up?
Can we drive further?
Look,
there's another team.
We can beat them!
Andale, andale.
Teams are running in.
I want to get a check.
Can we get a check, please?
No, okay.
Babe, load me up.
Ooh, they're spiky.
A couple more.
Oh!
Actually, it doesn't
smell too bad.
These things smell decent.
You girls
feel at home, or what?
Yes!
These feel so painful!
They're sharp
and pointy and they hurt!
Oh, yeah,
they feel real good.
- Ouch.
- Leanne, one more.
Okay.
Slow and steady.
Good job.
Check, please.
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you.
Route info.
Teams must now make
their way to Pasar Burung Barito
where they'll find this
traditional local bird market.
Once here, they'll
find the double U-turn,
which gives one team
the opportunity
to slow down another team
by forcing them to complete
both sides of the detour.
And it's a blind U-turn, meaning
that any team that U-turns
another will remain anonymous.
Caution, blind
double U-turn ahead.
Okay, let's go.
We're good?
Perfect.
I wonder where
Dylan and Kwame are.
Todd and Anna
are right there.
They don't know
where they're going.
We don't know where we're going.
It's a little bit stressful.
Thank you.
Are you guys
sure that's the way?
We don't know.
We think so.
Let's go.
We figure
let's stick with them.
They usually end up on top.
We'll just stick
together for now.
Hot, hot!
H-A-W-T, hawt!
Suck it up, buttercup.
I'm feeling a little
bit better about directions
now that we have a map,
and our cab drivers seems to be
a little bit more knowledgeable.
Here it is, right here.
Ow!
These are sharp, hey?
Oh yeah, I see people.
Martina and Phil
just showed up.
I can only
do three at a time.
It's so hot and humid!
I'm like dying!
Oh, my god,
it's so humid!
Aah!
Oh god!
I dropped one!
Hand me that.
These are prickly as--
Ow!
Hot as hell.
I have a pair
of gloves in my bag.
We packed them just for safety.
Yes.
- Is this it?
- Good job, baby.
Can we have a check, please?
Can we have
a check, please?
Yes!
You're taking
us to the bird market.
Check, please!
Check, please!
Thank you!
I think we passed
every team that was there
besides Leanne and Mar,
so possibly third or fourth.
Search the bird
market for your next clue.
Okay, right here.
U-turn.
- U-turn!
I don't want to U-turn.
I don't want
to U-turn anyone.
We're not U-turning anybody.
We're
at the front of the pack.
There's no need to put
that target on our backs.
Detour.
Ular or Kebeya.
In this detour, teams will
get a chance to learn more about
local Indonesian
customs and cultures.
It's their call, Ular or Kebeya.
Ular requires teams to make
their way to Langset Park,
and find this snake handler.
After choosing a crate,
racers must wash and fully dry
whatever snake they find inside.
Some are bigger than others.
Once the handler feels
the snake is spic and span,
teams will sit down
with this doctor,
who will offer each racer
a chance to cleanse their blood.
Here, racers will find out
that they each need to use
an alternative
medicine technique,
and attach a leech
to their partner's arm,
and let it do its work
for five minutes.
Once the snakes are clean,
and the leeches
have done their work,
teams will receive
their next clue.
In Kebeya, teams will need
to make their way to the nearby
Mayestik Market, and search
this massive textile bazaar
for this sewing stall.
Using the provided machines,
teams will need
to sew two panels,
which they will then
need to sew to the inside
of the lapels of two traditional
women's blazers.
Once they've correctly
sewn the two keybeyas...
the seamstress will give
them their next clue.
I'm not good with sewing.
I know I'm not good with sewing.
We're
choosing to do ular.
Oh, my god.
Okay, I'm in the Langset.
Okay.
Wonderful.
Forward right.
Look, these are
really big snakes.
No, it'll be okay.
Oh-ho-ho!
Okay, hello.
Got him?
Not close to his head.
I used to have a dog.
This is not the same
as washing my dog.
It's okay.
Ah!
Ahh!
Like porcupines, man.
This is good.
I'm feeling so
attractive right now.
Check, please!
- Woo!
- Oh!
Ow!
I hate this challenge.
- Captain, check please!
- Check, please!
Yeah!
Durian were so prickly.
Taylor's bleeding.
I don't know how
many more loads we have to do.
We've got this.
We're looking
for the old port.
We've got to be close.
We're near the water, right?
We see boats, so we
think where there's boats,
there's water, and where
there's water, there's ports.
This looks like
it circles back around.
It's the blind
leading the blind.
We are super lost.
I'm thinking why
did we sign up first?
This looks like
it circles back around.
Dead end.
Gotta go back.
We need to go back out on
the main road and look around.
We've got to across.
Watch, watch.
Yo, taxi's here.
Do you know where this is?
Yes.
Okay.
Follow that taxi.
- Fast, fast.
- Fast, fast.
The old port, here we go.
Yes, here.
Let's get it.
Oh, somebody's coming.
Put our
nametag on a crate
and fill it up with durian.
Okay, let's go.
Let's go.
- Okay.
- Oh, my gosh!
They're really sharp.
Hurry up!
Hurry up.
I don't want to
fumble any of these.
One mistake could hurt us.
Now the pressure's on.
Barito Bird
Market right here.
There's a double U-turn here.
Because we have a fairly
good lead on two teams...
We're not using
the U-turn this time around.
We're gonna keep racing here.
You want to
help a snake handler?
- Yeah.
- Okay, all nerve.
Caution, blind
double U-turn ahead.
I'm not sure
what blind means.
Oh, oh, I know!
We don't have to tell
them who U-turned someone.
We don't have to put
our picture up.
Yes!
Yes!
What do you want to do?
There's nobody
up there right now.
I think we should do it.
We just want to
slow down another team,
so it secures us a spot
on the next leg.
Yup, it's them.
We are choosing to U-turn
Martina and Phil.
We feel it'll just maybe
get us ahead one more step.
I think we
should do the snakes.
Yeah.
Nancy and Mellisa and Adam
and Courtney just showed up.
Yeah, this one.
Oh.
Oh, it's huge.
Oh, wow.
I've never held
a snake in my life.
Wah, okay.
Yeah, yeah.
Wow.
Wow.
I'm a little bit scared
of snakes, I guess.
Good job, Phil.
- Check.
- Check, please!
- Yes, thank you.
- Drive.
Barito Birds.
Ca-caw!
Ca-caw!
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
This is our moment
to not be last right here.
We're really close.
- Check, please!
- Check!
Check, check, check!
- Good!
- Perfect, thank you.
Every team except for Dylan and
Kwame are ahead of us right now,
so we're gonna try to make time.
- Go as fast as you can.
- Fast, fast.
Check, please.
We're a little
bit behind Todd and Anna.
It's still the beginning,
still the beginning.
Oh, look,
right there.
Oh, my god, we can
U-turn someone.
- Oh, my god, okay.
- Okay.
It has to be
someone behind.
Todd and Anna
and the coaches.
Classic line,
we're not here to make friends.
We need to win.
We need to get rid
of the strong teams.
We choose to
U-turn Todd and Anna.
We didn't see them
at the last challenge.
We're pretty confident
they're behind us.
Nothing personal.
Todd and Anna are a strong
team, so bye, guys.
- Detour.
- Snake?
- Let's do snake.
- Snake!
We're gonna do snake.
Yeah, we don't see
our photo, which is awesome.
Martina and Phil and Todd
and Anna have been U-turned,
- and we're not U-turned!
- And we're not.
That's a good sign.
Let's do the snake.
It might be cool.
They might bite us,
but whatever.
Whatever?
We've got to clean
this guy's dirty little neck,
and we are good to go.
Congratulations.
Wonderful!
Thank you!
Thank you.
Okay, next part.
- Treatment area.
- Treatment area.
I think
these are leeches.
We sit down to find
out we have to attach
a leech to each other.
Ahh!
I hate leeches.
I will hold the snake.
That's no problem.
I do not want a leech
sucking my blood.
- Come on.
- Are you ready?
Because this guy's
squirming away.
Ah, I can't grab him.
Ahh!
What was that?
Oh.
I thought he creeped up my arm.
Okay, ready?
- Give me your arm.
- Yeah, there we go.
Okay, we're on.
Five minutes.
Mine's biting.
This is a big guy.
He's gonna eat all of my blood.
I can't get yours to stick.
This one's not attaching.
We area struggling
with this leech.
He doesn't want to bite me.
Just suck my blood, please.
Ow!
I have
never held a snake.
Whoa.
Sorry.
Oh, he likes it.
- He likes it.
- This is a nice boy.
It's a nice
snakey-snakey.
I think we're good.
- He's clean.
- Yes!
Clean enough.
- Thank you!
- Thank you very much!
We've got to
go get our treatment.
- Treatment area.
- Over here.
Let's go.
Oh, this is cool.
One, two...
- Oh!
- Alright.
Alright, alright,
you're beautiful.
He's heavy.
Hi, babe.
He's interested in you.
Okay.
Oh, my god!
I can't.
I cannot.
No.
You pick that up.
That is a big snake.
Oh, my god.
Don't panic.
Only one of us can panic.
Don't look at me, snake.
Don't look at me, please.
Where's
the bird market?
Where is it?
- There's bird cages here.
- Are there?
There's bird cages.
Do you see anything?
Barito Market?
I heard birds.
Oh, I see it, Todd.
Right there,
by that yellow sign.
- There's us.
- Oh, no.
We've been U-turned.
We have no idea who U-turned us.
It's obviously frustrating,
but we're not gonna spend time
worrying about
who did it or why.
Phil and Martina
have to do it too, so...
Now the plan is to go get
the two sides of the detour done
as quickly as possible.
We're gonna do
the snake one first.
Hey, Dyl,
it's a close race.
Look, Todd and Anna
are right there.
Okay, let's go.
- We're not U-turned.
- Yes!
- Snakes.
- Ular, Ular.
Alright, let's go.
He's not biting me.
You're sweaty now.
He probably doesn't like it.
We get to put
leeches on each other.
I am so okay with this.
Oh, I don't like this.
Just calm down.
Wait, I hate leeches.
This is worse than snakes.
Oh, my god,
he's fricking' big.
Ah!
Ha-ha-ha!
Okay, calm down.
Calm down.
He's so big!
Ahh!
- He's on the wrong side.
- Okay, okay.
You can't do that.
You need to calm down.
There you go.
We're on.
Hm.
Is that attached?
You don't feel a pinch?
Yeah, okay.
Okay, it's starting.
You've got it.
Wait, ah, blaah!
I don't care.
Just put it on.
It's stuck on me now.
Hm.
Okay, here.
- Thank you.
- Ay, ay, ay, babe!
Argh!
Are we done?
- Awesome.
- You go.
- Thank you.
- Yay!
- Thank you.
- Route marker.
Make your way
to Bedung Teater Bulungan
and search outside
for your next clue.
Let's go.
We'll find our taxi here.
Right here.
Right here.
Marood!
Marood!
Marood!
Marood!
Come, hurry!
Yay!
- Let's go!
- Let's go.
We are in first place.
First place!
Mellisa and Nancy
left ahead of us.
Adam and Courtney
are just behind us.
- Okay.
- Thank you!
Thank you so much.
Let's get our taxi.
Cabs are super important,
and this gentleman seems to know
- where he's going.
- I love you.
I love you.
Got your back.
Okay, this one.
I'm a little nervous,
but it's not like my worst fear.
Holy!
It's okay, Todd.
You can do this.
We have no snakes
back home at all.
- Come on in.
- I know.
Sorry, I'm trying my best.
Water, a little bit of
soap, and we sponge her down.
Let's see our friend.
Lord, protect me.
Yo, keep his head away from me.
Kwame, Kwame,
it's not that bad.
Did you see
our snake, bro?
Says you!
Yeah, yours is a little bigger.
Yeah, boy.
Don't be scared.
Just get in there.
We're not even
close to being done.
Aw, he's giving me a hug.
There's more
birds down there.
- Do you have a clue?
- No, he doesn't.
This is frustrating because
we're seeing so many birds
at this market, but we just
need to find one clue.
I see it.
I see it!
- Where, where?
- There!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Oh no, we've
been U-turned!
Oh shoot.
Oh no, we've
been U-turned!
Oh, shoot!
Maybe they think get
one of the weaker teams out,
but we're strong.
We're competitors.
We're here to fight.
Let's go to
the sewing station first.
We are not going home today.
We're gonna do both
and get it done.
Yeah, let's go.
Make our way to
Gedung Teater Bulungan.
I almost feel like I can
speak Indonesian now.
Is this it?
We've got
to find our next clue.
Right here?
Right here.
Oh, roadblock!
Who thinks
they are handy?
In this roadblock, racers
will take part in the dance
of a thousand hands,
as they learn and master
the traditional saman dance.
Awesome.
Here, teams must watch
and memorize the complicated
hand and body movements
of the dance.
When they feel they can
move in perfect unison,
they'll take to the stage
for a performance.
Once they've got the right
rhythm and are in perfect sync,
the drummer will give them
their next clue.
Ohhh!
I'm not pretty,
but I'm handy.
Master one of Indonesia's
most popular dances!
Shoot!
Mel would have been
the perfect one to do it
because she can dance.
I was expecting
to build something.
Oh, they're so beautiful.
1, 2.
No.
This way.
This, and this.
Argh!
She'll be great.
On the right here?
Thank you.
Who thinks they are handy?
I'm handy.
I'm gonna be doing
this roadblock.
I'll do it.
Can you teach me
how to dance?
Wow.
This is extremely difficult.
Lots of hand movements.
I don't like bugs.
I don't like leeches.
I don't like blood.
I don't like needles!
Ow!
Ow, ow!
- We are one.
- Be one with it.
Be the leech,
be the leech.
I am the leech.
There you go.
Thank you.
- Route info.
- We don't know
what Gadung Teater Bulungan is,
but hopefully, we can get there
quickly, and get our clue.
Yeah, fast, fast!
Ha, it's a race!
It's a race.
- Do you know sewing?
- Sewing?
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da,
da-da-da-da-da-da...
Oh, maybe on the first floor.
Go, go, go, go, go.
I hear sewing machines.
Where?
In this detour,
you sew one panel closed,
and then sew that panel
to the inside of the collar
of the blazer.
And I have to do two of them.
Okay,
I know how to do it.
I've got this.
I've got this.
I'm a high school
economics teacher.
I taught textiles in the past.
The buttons
are on that side,
so we've got to go like this.
I'm solely responsible
for this detour challenge.
We just have to finish
before Todd and Anna.
Yeah.
We have to finish.
Oh, man,
this is like stressful.
Just breathe, breathe.
- Are we good?
- I think we're good.
Nice and clean and dry.
Yes, it is.
Nice.
Let's go, Todd.
- Okay.
- Yeah, give him.
Congratulations.
Yes, sir!
Ah, Ha!
There, over.
Yup.
Let's go give it a try.
I am so not
confident doing this,
but I'm sure gonna
give it my best.
Let's go, Nancy.
You've got this!
Ahh!
You're doing great!
Let's try it again!
- Roadblock.
- Okay, I'll do it.
Okay.
- Want me to go?
- Yeah,
- you're gonna kill that.
- I want to try it.
Adam's gonna
give it a try here.
I'm so excited.
- Yeah.
- You did awesome!
- I love you!
- I'm ready for this.
Leanne, I love you.
XOXO.
Oh!
Am I up or down?
Ah!
No, no.
One more time, one more
time and you've got this.
Oh, so
it's always under.
- Okay.
- 1, 2.
Oh.
This is gonna
be really hard.
Okay, let's
go one more time.
Boss man, thank you.
Okay.
Thank you.
Let's go!
Dylan and Kwame just left.
- Ow.
- I know.
Thank you.
Let's go, Todd.
We've got one side
of the detour down.
One more to go, and then
we rock and roll.
My sister is so amazing.
She's such a great sewer.
I got it.
Yes, a judge, please,
please, please.
Please, please,
please, please, please.
Yes!
- Thank you!
- Ya!
- Thank you!
- I love you!
Thank you!
Let's go to the snake challenge.
- Let's go, hon.
- Yeah, go straight,
- and then around.
- Sure, yeah.
- Just go back the same way.
- Yeah.
Oh, my god, oh, my god!
Phil and Martina,
we just passed them,
so they just finished
the other side of the detour.
It's just like
head to head.
Oh, my gosh,
they're right behind us.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
Good job, Nuna!
Good job.
- Thank you.
- Keep up the pace.
We've already
moved up two spots.
This here?
Here, here, here, here!
Who thinks they're handy?
- Me?
- Yeah.
Let's go.
Oh, no.
Oh, man, this is tough.
Oh, I know that!
It's okay.
He's a fan favourite.
Oh, this is going
faster than I thought it would.
I'll go
through it again.
It's very important
that we get out
as quick as possibly because
we haven't won a leg yet,
and now is our chance.
So right now, we have
to concentrate on dancing.
Oh!
Okay, I've got it.
I've got it.
I'm feeling good.
I'm going to make
another attempt.
Smile, Leanne!
Smile, okay?
Thank you!
Oh, my god!
I'm so proud of her!
Leanne just did
the dance, and she got it,
and I'm hoping I'm
gonna get it this time.
Keep going.
Keep going.
Okay, okay, bye, guys!
Goodbye!
Make your way to MONAS
and search for Jon
at your next pitstop.
Teams must now make
their way to Merdeka Square,
a sprawling, wide-open,
185-acre green park
in the heart of Jakarta.
Once here, they must search
for the MONAS monument.
This 433-foot high monument
in the centre of the square
celebrates Indonesia's
independence,
and will act as the fourth
pitstop of the race.
The last team to check
in here may be eliminated.
Taxi!
Taxi!
Where's our taxi?
Hello.
MONAS fast.
We got the best cab driver.
We're on
Leanne and Mar's tail.
Nancy and Mellisa
they're right behind us.
- They're right behind us.
- Argh!
Racing for number one!
Nancy and Mellisa
they're right behind us.
Our fast cab driver
is gonna get us there
in number one,
and then he's gonna
get a little tip.
Is that the MONAS?
- Ready?
- Thank you.
See you.
Bye, bye.
How do we get in?
Follow these people.
MONAS, where is it?
- Where's the monument?
- It's this way.
I think we've
got to go that way.
Come on, girls!
Come on, Mel.
Come on, Nancy!
Hustle.
Nice work.
Welcome to
Jakarta, Indonesia.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Leanne, Mar,
you're team number one.
Yes!
Yes!
Another leg!
Woo!
Nancy, Mellisa, ladies,
you're team number two.
Woo-hoo!
You were very close
to these two.
You're little twerps
for getting ahead of us.
You guys are
such powerhouses.
We've been neck
in neck and we love it.
...the entire time.
We love it.
Leanne, Mar,
as the winners of this leg,
you've won an exciting
trip for two
to Ho Chi Min City, Vietnam.
- Oh!
- Oh, my gosh!
This is our second win.
It feels amazing.
We've remained at the top
so far this race,
and we just have
to stay consistent.
- We can do this, Todd.
- Yeah.
Get it right
the first time.
Is that it?
Good, thank you.
When I was home-schooled,
every week
I would go to sewing lessons
for six years.
And I would do fashion
shows in the clothes
that I had sewn for myself,
so I've done a fair
amount of sewing.
Anna, you're killing it.
Thank you.
Yikes.
- Slow, slow.
- It's so hard.
Oh, I don't know
if I'm doing it right, Todd.
I've never held a snake
like this before in my life,
but it's amazing.
Good, okay.
Good, clean baby.
Beautiful, beautiful snake.
- That is clean.
- That is clean?
- Yes, thank you.
- Thank you.
Let's go.
Let's go.
She's doing well.
This is the toughest part.
5, 6, 7, 8.
This is why I got
kicked out of dance class
when I was younger.
I'll get it next time,
I promise.
Oh!
Oh, heartbreaking!
Tay,
that was really good!
Stay calm.
You're good.
You've got this!
Right now, it looks
like everybody's here,
except for Martina and Phil,
and Todd and Anna,
so we can jump up a lot.
I did karate as a kid,
and this is similar.
It's just memorizing movements.
I'm relating it
a lot to that.
Yeah, he's
got it, he's got it.
He's got it.
Thank you so much.
Let's go.
We got there in sixth,
and we're leaving in third.
That's big.
Oh, sir, let's go.
Let's go.
Ow.
Ow.
Ow.
This is not an average
Friday night at home.
This is the most bizarre thing
I've ever done in my life.
- Yeah, okay.
- Oh, I'm finished.
Thank you.
- Yes.
- We got it!
We got it!
Let's go.
Let's go.
Okay, let's go
put them on the mannequin,
and hope for the best.
- There we go.
- Check.
We really,
really hope we got it,
but I don't think we did.
- Thank you!
- Thank you, thank you.
Thank you.
I was a little emotional
in that sewing challenge.
I was just feeling
really nervous.
I didn't want to let Todd down
because we're near the back.
Ha.
It's okay.
You crushed that first time.
You've got it, bro.
Yeah!
Woo!
Dude, way to go!
Yes, girl!
Oh, my god.
Yes!
I love you!
We arrived to this
challenge in second place,
and now we are
the only team left.
I'm gonna go try again.
Babe, you've got this.
I have no idea
how many attempts it's been,
but I'm starting to freak out.
I'm starting to
get in my own head.
This is not
happening well for me.
Oh!
This is terrible.
Take a breath.
Don't get flustered.
Oh, this is terrible.
I'm really battling with
that whole tempo thing.
I'm not a dancer.
I don't hold a beat very well,
and I'm just not
doing well right now.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
- Oh, right here.
- Grab it.
Who thinks they're handy?
You can fix things.
You can fix my IKEA dresser.
Okay, I'll do it.
Master one of Indonesia's
most popular dances.
I'm so happy it's a dance
routine because I love to dance.
As a kid, I'd just breakdance
in my parents' basement,
and then as I grew up, I did
a little bit of choreography,
and I feel like I have this.
5, 6, 7, 8.
- You, Todd?
- Me?
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Okay, me.
I know Todd can do this.
Dylan, Kwame,
you're team number three.
Finally!
Moving on up
to the podium, boys!
Let's go!
Thank you.
- Take it easy, fellas.
- Thank you.
The curse
of the sign-up board is over.
Come on!
Come on!
- Zainab, Monica...
- Yes.
- You're team number four.
- What?!
Yes!
Bring it in!
Today we've
had our best finish yet.
Everyone's been
underestimating us,
but we're actually very strong.
- Hey!
- Hey.
Fourth place.
Jon!
Thanks, bro.
Taylor, Courtney, you
guys are team number five.
Nice, dude.
Nice.
We made it
through Jakarta.
Oh-ho!
Todd's a good dancer.
He's really coordinated.
Oh...
I gotta stop.
Go, Phil!
You've got this!
Yes!
Yes!
Thank you!
Oh!
Oh, man!
Ahh!
I love you!
Jakarta, Jakarta,
Indonesia, number one!
- Taxi, taxi!
- Yes!
Once I read that it's a
dance routine, I knew I had it.
I knew I could catch up,
and I knew we weren't
going to go home.
I'm getting
a little bit nervous,
but we can get ahead here.
You've got it.
Don't get frustrated.
- The walk of shame.
- You were so close, Todd.
Argh!
Babe,
practice makes perfect.
3, 4.
Okay.
It's so stressful.
Bring it in, you two.
Come on!
Jon!
Martina, Phil, you two
are team number six!
- Oh, my god!
- Good job!
We got U-turned and it
sucked, but we survived it,
and we're still in this race.
Watch out!
We're
the puppy dog attack.
- Alright!
- Thanks, Jon.
Bye.
Woo!
Woo!
I don't like
that it's down to this.
It's stressful, girl.
It is.
Thank you, sir.
Woo!
You are amazing!
Adam just got it,
so it's super important
to get the next one,
so we can have a race
to the finish line.
Good job, Todd!
Woo!
We're still in it.
We're still in it.
Babe, we've
gotta find a taxi.
Keep calm, love.
It's okay.
It's not okay.
This is gonna kill us.
Taxi.
There's one I think right there.
- Taxi right here!
- Taxi!
Sir,
do you know MONAS?
MONAS?
Hurry, fast, fast.
As fast as you can.
Just as
fast as possible.
Just hoping for
the best right now.
We're going
to the pitstop
somewhere called MONAS.
We're racing
for last place here.
This is MONAS.
Okay.
- There?
- We're close.
I know we're close.
- MONAS?
- MONAS?
- Right there.
- Do you see Jon?
Come on, babe!
Come!
Come!
- Right there.
- Toddy, go, Toddy!
- Come on.
- Oh!
Jon!
Oh.
Oh, man, you guys.
Courtney, Adam,
you're team number seven.
Yes, babe.
Yes.
Todd, Anna...
you are the last team
to arrive.
I'm sorry to tell you this,
but you have been eliminated
from the race.
Okay.
What are you
feeling right now, Anna?
I'm just not ready.
We had way more in us
than this.
You want to win, so to
go out now, in the fourth leg,
it's a bummer.
Kind of like
the leg we ran today.
I love this guy so, so much.
Todd, I just want to say
thank you for putting yourself
out there, and telling your
story because it inspires me,
it inspires so
many other people.
No matter what
you're going through,
if you're going through
bullying, anxiety,
anything like that, to have
people there to help you,
to encourage you,
to help you get through it,
and just to push on.
Know who you are deep down
inside, and keep going.
Well, you've shone
your light
on the Amazing Race
Canada Heroes Edition
in a really incredible way.
I wish you nothing but the best.
- Take care, you two.
- Thank you, Jon.
Come on in here.
Todd, great to have
you on the race, buddy.
Anna, I just
want to thank you,
just how strong
you've been for me,
and helping me get
through things, and yeah,
just any moment I know I can
lean on you, and trust you,
so thank you.
I love you.
Next time on the Amazing
Race Canada Heroes Edition...
We're going to Canada.
Teams fly
back home to Canada.
We're going home!
...and duel it out
in Stratford, Ontario.
En garde!
For some,
it's a Shakespearean tragedy.
For others, a comedy.
Romeo, Romeo,
where art thou, Romeo?
Teams sink their
teeth into a detour.
- Oh!
- That leave some boxed in...
It's okay.
Calm down.
...while for others
it's a mad scramble...
E-D.
...as they
try to stay afloat.
We're not going home!
NO!
