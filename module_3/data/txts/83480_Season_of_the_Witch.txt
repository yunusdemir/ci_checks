No! I beg you!
I told the truth!
There are a witch!
My daughter! No!
CITY OF VILLACH
1235 A.D.
No!
Please!
Have you been found guilty of witchcraft
and counsel with the devil.
If you want to set free souls
you repent and confess your sins.
I confess!
Tell me, girl.
You signed a pact with Lucifer?
Yes. I signed a pact.
I confess!
I beg you! Take pity!
I made a salve for the rider,
but it was pig fat.
There was no witchcraft. I swear!
Priest?
You will
burn in hell!
Dispose of it.
-No. Please
-No, no!
-She is a Witch. Play her!
-No!
Wait! You said that I deliver.
Soul, child.
Your soul will be saved.
The body should be entrusted with the Lord
for the forgiveness of sins.
No! I beg you!
Wait!
We need to pull bodies.
There are words to be spoken
Solomon's book,
not to awaken again.
They were hanged and drowned.
I think there are enough dead.
Amen.

Stray Souls
to Hell.
A glorious day for the Church!
You call that glorious?
Killing women and children?
Take care, Knight.
- You swore to serve the cause of life.
- For God.
Not for this.
I am the Lord's language
in this world.
- His voice whispers in my ear.
- Maybe it's not his voice.
How dare you?
I am the voice of Church!
Swimming in the truth and not to blame
in light of the Lord.
You are not only
a spot of blood on his hands!
Who is your guide
naughty language, Behmen?
Let's get outta here.
There you go!
Who's gonna stop us?
Styria COAST
ONE MONTH LATER
Goats walking free
no shepherd around.
The pen to be bypassed?
All?
We walked all day
and I have not met anyone.
Nor need.
I hope to meet a chicken.
Hey?
Anybody there?
Hey?
what existed with them?
I do not know.
I have seen so much death...
Some deserved, some not.
What do you think they did
to deserve such a death?
Nothing.
Finally a city!
There could be recognized.
Should it go around, Behmen.
Which?
The horses we can handle.
There are horse farms.
We need horses
appropriated, food, supplies.
A blessing, Mr.?
A blessing, Mr..
Please
Let them come to me!
-I beg you!
-Please
- Take me!
- Enough!
My children
they are dying!
Have mercy of us!
Heavenly Father glorified,
receive pain and suffering
that we bring.
Liberate us!
-What madness is this?
-The plague.
Plague?
How has never seen.
It included all the land.
- There is a cure?
- None.
How long is it?
This season marks the second year.
- How many have died?
- Some say that three or four.
Even with my own hands I buried
two children and mother who gave them life.
How did you hear that?
We travel.
We recently returned.
- Here they are.
- The best horse of mine.
Thanks.
Forget it!
Felson, here.
what?
They saw the cross on the sword.
I told you to go around the city.
You! Traitors!
Damn!
well.
Come with me.
Drop it!
Show your face.
Arrest these deserters.
Wait.
Let me see.
It's yours?
Come with me.
I hope we go to dinner.
What do you want from us, Priest?
I can not tell you that.
-Excuse me, Your Eminence.
-What, Debelzaq?
This knight's sword.
Come here.
-Tell me your name.
-I am Behmen de Blybrook
Behmen, yes,
and your friend, Felson.
Your names are known to me.
Your victories have become legends.
Yes, I am infected.
The plague is everywhere
It's a curse sent from Hell.
He was thrown upon us
The Black Witch.
Black Witch?
I myself have heard the confession.
Witch should be taken
Severak the monastery.
The monks there have final
copy of an ancient books,
rituals that will destroy
witch's powers,
and will ward off plague.
What this has to do with us?
Our lines were tight.
I'll have to go.
Best of my knight, Eckhart
has offered help.
So our priest, Debelzaq.
I ask the same thing.
Want to serve the church again?
- I can not.
- You swore before the Lord.
- You have been issued by the oath?
- Lord I swear.
There are those who kill in his name.
You know the punishment for treason.
I ask again,
Behmen de Blybrook
Do you serve for God and church?
I no longer serve the church.
Inside.
Both
What do deserters?
He hangs?
I burn?
-I think both.
-Yes.
If I had to choose,
I'd rather hang myself.
She's the witch?
I do not see that.
The priest said she confessed.
We both know that the church
can be very persuasive.
Yes.
orry that I dragged
into this, Felson.
I like dungeons,
and this is not so bad.
We spent nights
places more ugly.
I certainly.
What's that smell?
I think it comes from you.
"I no longer serve the church."
Have you seen the priest?
As if someone had their needs
the water was blessed.
They are men without God!
Unbelievers!
They have sinned against the Lord
and against His only son, Jesus!
You must be punished!
Want to talk to the Cardinal?
Tell him to go to Severak,
one condition.
To be judged fairly.
You can not bargain with the church.
No I do for church.
Let us give the weapons back.
And dismiss all charges
against us.
We're here.
Monastery there.
The distance is 400 miles.
Six days of travel.
-As you can see I set a route.
-Will it guide us around here
-This is the most direct route.
-through the river for...
300 miles through dense forest,
and among the mountains?
That's Wormwood Forest.
There's a place where to venture.
Many were lost in it,
and I have never been seen before.
Tell me, Priest,
you ever go down this road?
-No.
-Of course.
They are the best maps of the country.
We do better
with an instructor.
Someone who already has
traveled a lot...
Perhaps a taxes collector
or a dealer.
There is a person, but...
Visitors. what I can
do do by the gentlemen?
Want to throw fruit at me
or hit me between the legs?
You are Hagamar,
Charlatan?
Yes. It means, no.
I am Hagamar,
but I never fooled anyone.
sell relics.
authentic relics.
Where you sell your goods?
Everywhere.
We have customers from here to Prague.
-And in Severak?
-Yes, the monks.
We sold a comet tail
and a flag of Egypt.
A bargain, surely.
Then you know the way to the monastery?
Like the backhand.
I should draw a map, but...
The jailer is prepared to release,
With one condition.
-You will be our tutor to Severak.
-Acceptable condition.
But if you let go,
and try to run...
Such thoughts dishonor you.
I swear by all the saints,
to crap where I live that lie.
I'm ahead of you in line.
Are we clear?
witch is unconscious.
I put something in the food to comfort her.
Open prison.
Witch will prepare for the trip.
-It's just a child.
-Do not be fooled.
Felson!
Hold it!
The faster we get
the Severak, the better.
Now it's quiet.
Who is she?
- Witch.
- Witches?
Said nothing of any witch.
What did you think we do Severak,
sell amulets?
-Kill the witch!
-That is not a woman!
-You've infected us!
-Did you angry with God!
Go back to hell, and plague take you!
Vanish with this woman!
Demonule!
I am concerned.
Think of something else.
Try to scare you.
And fails.
How you gave this girl?
It was found
Maburn outside the city,
wandering and grumbling words
that one can not understand them.
- And this one is a witch?
- No, but it's a sign.
On the fourth day after her arrival,
plague was upon us.
As in every city
went through.
By my village
no one saw her passing.
By my village
no one saw her passing.
And yet, the plague was rushed.
It's stronger than it appears.
You think it's a witch?
I've felt the power.
You think a kid is that?
I have seen children destroying men
without raising a finger.
Whenever you want to discuss this?
I was in France!
And I'm not complaining.
You stole a full year salary.
Yes, but...
... gave me so much in return.
Look at us.
I went a month or the church service,
and here are we.
Deserters in the
service of the church.
You know that we watch.
Let's welcome him properly.
Dismounted.
Who are you and why are we watching?
I asked you something.
It's an altar boy
in the service of Cardinal.
My name is Kay.
My father was a knight.
Yuran Wolenbar.
He struggled to embrace.
You may have heard of him.
What?
Let go with you to Severak.
Easy, boy.
To catch me in your service
Instead, ask to promise me
that I'll put a good word to return
to become a knight.
An altar boy services.
I feel safer already.
I was twice on the list,
flags and won for bravery.
That is not a tournament, boy.
Come back to your mother.
The road is for everyone, mate.
I need your permission
to travel on it.
Give him a chance to withdraw his words.
My sincere apologies.
Not to me. His.
I can not. He insulted me first.
You teach him good manners.
Take it easy, Felson.
Use your other hand.
We do not want to kill him.
Send it back.
And hurry.
You're welcome.
Not bad for an altar boy.
What the hell was that?
Fight like a man, fricosule.
Enough!
Maybe you can help.
I heard what the Cardinal said.
about your heroism of the Crusades.
I come and I
but I was too young.
If you're lucky.
Tell me where you enrolled?
There was a priest in his village Felson.
He said that whoever comes in the Crusades,
will receive the blessing of the church
and forgiveness of sins.
Part sins
Felson's caught his attention.
-It is not true.
-Then he asked to the priest:
"what sins would be forgiven?
Would forgive adultery?"
The priest said:
"Yes, if you serve two years."
"What about robbery?"
"Yes, if you serve three years."
So he leans Felson
and tells the priest:
"Sign me up for ten years."
I brought food.
And blankets.
You're not like the others.
You're good.
Debelzaq you did wrong?
The place where I go...
What will happen to me there?
It will decide
if you are guilty or not.
It was a girl in my village
suspected to be witches.
They tied a stone
and threw it into the lake.
If you drown,
would know that it's not a witch.
But not drowned.
She survived.
We called it proof of witchcraft,
and burned at the stake.
Thee and will not happen.
It will have a just trial.
You have my word.
Did she tell something?
why question?
I only want alert him.
The witch is artful.
She plays a man against the another.
We have to watch for cart.
watch the cart?
The girl is caged!
-And I am tired.
-I go.
Maybe you should stay
else to watch.
I'll go.
Do not worry, boy.
You have time to Severak.
Eckhart, be careful.
I came to your place.
Do not you tired?
No, no.
Not much sleep lately.
I thought about how much
girl reminds me of my daughter.
I'm sorry by your loss.
What was the name of her?
Mila
The name of her was Mila.
Tell me, priest.
The cardinal gave its word
that he would receive a fair trial.
But he gave the word
that will put and end to the plague?
What do you mean?
Think about what people say
if he would be found guilty.
Priest, just as I know
which the Church can
not afford it. Not now.
No.
Our duty is so go
trial.
The monks will decide his fate.
Exactly.
The monks will decide his fate.
And I do not want to take part in it.
And hopefully no others
when they hear what I said.
Wait!
Please, do not me let
alone with him.
Is it afraid of his
-Hear me.
-Eckhart!
Give me this key!
How to escape?
She grabbed the key from the neck!
In which part of the run?
Maybe it went on the
path towards the village.
Kay Eckhart and there.
She's in the market!
there she is
It is a grave.
A mass grave.
Father!
Where you...
-Father!
-Mila?
Dad?
I am here.
Eckhart!
-Mila?
-Daddy.
-Mila?
-Daddy, where are you
-Mila, my daughter!
-Daddy, are you?
Do not run away from.
Dad!
Mila!
Daddy.
Mila?
Eckhart!
Eckhart!
Felson!
Behmen!
Where are you?
He appeared in a hurry.
Why not stop?
Why can not I see?
God, what have I done?
what did I do?
I looked into my eyes,
but did not see me.
He called me Mila.
Behmen.
He had to flee,
I had no choice.
I could not leave to touch me again.
I'm so sorry
Please
I do not go back to it.
Please, I implore.
Please. No.
Please
Heavenly Father, we pray Thee.
Take it to your servant, Johan Eckhard,
the kingdom of Heaven
for he was a soldier of the cross
and fought in thy name
Your name and the only son
Jesus Christ.
Thus died
for God's glory.
Amen.
Amen.
Anybody want to say
few words?
Whether it's sacrifice
not be in vain.
Behmen.
I need to speak with you.
what is now, priest?
I must warn others
to be careful around her.
Things that she can use...
Listen me
Eckhard witch killed.
You heard what Kay said.
It was not sane.
We heard speaking
about his daughter.
And what you propose, exactly?
She sees weakness
that dwells in our hearts.
And everything he sees,
will use against us.
Cruciatule!
I am grateful
for your help.
You're very brave.
A man like you would not accept
as a young woman to hurt.
Debelzaq thinks you're guilty
Eckhard's death.
And you believe that?
After what he did?
I had no reason to do wrong.
Has always been kind to me.
He said that fellow
with his daughter.
I see death
you press.
Allow me to and alleviate suffering.
Some good things can be achieved
even behind bars.
Kay, remember,
it was not your fault.
It was the witch.
Nobody else.
He died by my sword.
-Could be to anyone.
-But it was not!
It was by my.
It was mine. I've killed him.
Why stop?
How is this bridge?
Last time I saw
eight or nine years ago.
I remember that look different.
So we need that he is a biter
as a guide.
I have said,
I'm not a biter.
Do not really guide you, eh?
How to go
beams over this rotten?
Blame me
for the bridge?
You're the one
which led us towards him.
You're the one...
Behmen.
Behmen!
Take everything from the cart.
Move horses. One by one.
When I'm number three.
One, two, three.
My hands!
Not much anymore!
Help!
Hagamar, tie ropes of horses.
A to use it to pull the wagon.
If I let it go,
it will be easier.
Please, help!
-Not one to resist.
-Yes. Push!
Push!
I will not succeed.
Leave me out.
-Go!
-Push!
It was as on-here!
I saved hundreds of times.
Have some faith.
Kay, bring me a clean bandage
for priest's hand.
It would be a shame to bleed
to death.
Thank you.
Felson!
Serious?
What is this place?
Hagamar, where are we?
In Wormwood Forest.
A damn fog.
It's like a veil in sight.
I hope we never lost.
I hardly see my hand
in sight.
The only reason you're with us
s because you said that you know the road.
I know the way, but do not see him.
I know.
Kay told me what
happened on the bridge.
He said that it saved his life
with only a hand.
It is hard to believe.
I thought what we impose
believe.
And you think they are witches,
Behmen?
You're not afraid of me...
It has?
Do not you sleep?
Neither do I.
Do not know if it's because of fog,
Altitude...
It's unsettling.
Even for a knight.
Even for a
coward wretch like me
It was not that
which I meant
No?
Behmen, how many will die
up to reach a Severak?
- None, though I oppose it.
- And if you can not?
Then what happens?
Forgive me if I hesitate
I leave my life in your hands
But I have a better solution.
A kill the bastard!
Right here and right now.
Tell other
he tried to escape.
She wanted our hardly.
What was I to do? I had no choice.
Who would contradict?
I, for example.
Have you heard?
- What? What happened?
- Listen.
Wolves.
what do we do?
Kill as many as you can.
No way.
Take the horses. I take the cart.
Behmen.
It's too late.
We can not help.
Behmen! What are you doing?
Behmen! What are you doing?
Is what he knows best,
kill the innocent.
You can not do that!
Get away.
Two lives were already lost.
And no one suffers
more than me.
Then get out of my way
or arrow that is yours!
If we fail now, those lives
were wasted in vain.
Not everything will be lost.
Four people will stay alive.
What counts four lives, compared
with tens of thousands will be lost,
I know, maybe in your heart
not a place for God, Behmen.
But in my heart
I know that he would not abandon us.
For God's sake...
No one has shed more blood,
the name of God than me.
Too-good God
would require something like a man.
If you kill
you can not blame God
only yourself.
We are approaching the end of the road.
Look.
Severak.
I came a long way, Behmen.
I have crossed oceans, deserts...
I saw things that few have seen...
When all will end,
I want to see the valley where I was born.
And you?
I'm not struggling homesickness.
Then come with me.
We will stay in the house porch
olovina and drink,
and known only to tell our stories
The few who survived.
If they will remain so few,
Who will believe us?
We will know the truth, buddy.
We will know it...
Anybody?
Is anyone there?
Where are the monks?
In the chapel. To the this hour,
should be doing the prayers.
Brothers, sorry mess,
But come this far.
No way.
We would not abort.
God would not abandon us
We must make a move.
Here we have no hope. Only plague...
But where to go?
These people would have helped us.
By now, everything depends on God.
Prayer is our only salvation.
Our Father who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name...
Debelzaq!
Thy kingdom come
-Thy will be done...
-Debelzac!
This day our daily bread
Give us this day
And forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive our debtors
Get up!
And lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil...
Amen.
Debelzaq.
Solomon's Key.
Paper-speaking cardinals.
In its pages it says that it is
all the rituals, prayers,
and incantations used
church people
over the centuries
to ward off evil forces.
You...
... you to fulfill the rituals?
what we have here?
That's right court
that you promised me, Behmen?
Single and have decided his fate.
Let all who are here,
the Lord, to know
that this woman
is accused of witchcraft,
and acknowledged that sparked plague
against all mankind.
I'm flattered!
But I must admit...
I have deceived all...
You think you can save by withdrawing your
words, but not so.
Speak the truth
before God!
Truth?
Do not talk to me about truth,
ipocritule!
For centuries the whole, you and people like you
you have burned, hanged, crucified,
all those who stood
way.
In fact,
you should thank.
The church sent more souls
to Perdition
than all the wars, ciumele
and hunger in one place.
-That's a lie, vrajitoareo!
-Debelzaq, rite!
And you, Behmen?
It was not only needed to save a child.
Someone to ease your
deserves all the blame for mercy.
Do you really believe that saving a child,
you change anything?
Come Behmen.
Your sins are legendary.
How many innocents have you killed
with your own sword?
They are godless men.
Heathens!
They were wrong against the Lord
and his only son, Jesus Christ.
Must be punished!
How do you know?
That's not a witch!
This is not a witch...
EXORCISM
Do not read those words!
We need more
holy water.
Here!
Tell me, Behmen...
We go there to destroy the demon
or to save face?
Both.
I found holy water
You did well.
So here you go, Kay.
-I did not understand.
-It's not your war.
I made a vow
I join your cause.
Release you from your vow.
There's no shame in it.
The honor is not something that can
be neglected or forgotten.
An oath must be taken to end
otherwise not swear at all.
Even with the cost of your life?
Even so
Kneel, Kay.
Speak for me.
- Give me courage, Lord...
- Give me courage, Lord...
- For I am your servant.
- For I am your servant.
- Give me strength to fight...
- Give me strength to fight...
- To destroy my enemies...
- To destroy my enemies...
- As dust before the storm.
- As dust before the storm.
-Amen.
-Amen.
Amen.
Get up as a knight.
Felson.
what?
Deep in the heart,
I know I deserve it.
But it will do.
Demon could escape
at any moment.
Why wait
until I reached Severak?
Can not escape
was its purpose.
He wanted to get here.
Debelzaq, you said you tried Eckhard
to release.
Not one to be adept at it.
- Dad!
- Nina!
He then killed. So the Hagamar.
He stood in his way.
He stayed on the way of him.
Fucking kill her!
Even now, we get rid of it.
God!
The more Severak go faster,
the better.
He's right. All that was done,
led us here.
Here.
Why did they do, a dead monk,
that?
Why would bind to office?
It's a passage from
Book of Solomon.
Here are more.
And others.
Copy.
To spread the philosophy of Solomon
All over the world
and more than that.
Will Book!
So the demon has deceived us to believe
that girl is a witch.
which the girl was a witch.
He knew that a witch will be taken before
those holding the Book of Solomon.
You saw what he did this plague...
If a book to arrive
in the hands of the demon,
We will be cursed
the dark forever.
This is our last refuge.
You should thank everyone.
You have sacrificed so much
bring it to me here
and now I've brought the book.
Debelzaq...
Quiet!
- Warning!
- Behmen!
-Where am I?
-who?
monks?
You can destroy!
Continue reading.
Cape...
Cut off his head!
They're like cockroaches.
Felson!
It does not do ideia of as
this damned book
it has me tormentado
along centuries!
We destroyed the others.
This is the last.
Tonight everything is over.
Felson!
Stop reading!
Behmen...
What should I do?
Take care of her.
God be with you, Felson.
It's strange...
Do I owe so much
someone I've never even met.
I do not know what to say.
Say what you heart leads you.
My name is Anna.
I owe my life.
God bless.
You tell me about them?
I want to know.
And so, the plague has passed
and life is back among us.
Many say that the plague was not only
a plague that has passed
just as you pass a fluster.
They know that the darkness
was close.
That sacrifices were made...
Heroes that were lost...
I'll tell the story.
I was there
I know
