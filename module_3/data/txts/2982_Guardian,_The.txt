I sometimes still find myself
driving late at night
back to that area of town.
I'm in my car.
You know?
And the adrenaline
starts to pump,
and I'm on auto pilot.
Ready to turn
into the parking lot
where I know I can score.
Only difference is, these days,
I don't take that final turn.
I pick up my phone
and call my sponsor, tom.
And we meet for coffee
or I come here and tell you.
It's being in it with you guys,
not being alone.
That's what gets me through it.
Thanks, Hank.
We're gonna hear from someone
who hasn't stood before us yet.
So, remember how it felt the first
time you addressed the group
and give him your
attention and support.
Nick.
Hi, I'm Nick.
Hi, Nick.
Hi.
Uh, I have to be here.
Excuse me.
Is this Phil's meeting at 12:30?
Thanks.
I got busted
with 10 grams of cocaine
in my apartment
about a year ago.
It was a party, so, uh...
I have to be here.
And Phil just thought
it was time that I, uh,
stood up and...
Talked about it.
So...
A couple of months ago,
I scored a couple of grams,
and I sort of binged.
But I haven't since.
And I won't again.
And...And...
Thanks. Thanks, Phil.
I need to speak to Barbara.
Legal services of Pittsburgh.
Uh, he's out of the office.
Can I transfer you
to his voice mail?
All right.
May I help you?
Um, I called yesterday.
I believe we spoke.
You're Barbara?
Yes.
Well, my husband has this
supply and repair company
and he took out a loan
from this guy--
your husband owns
his own business?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
We only take cases
for people who can't pay
for legal representation.
Oh, well, I would gladly
pay for whatever I can.
No, no.
You don't understand.
We don't take payment.
Sorry to have troubled you.
It's no problem.
Oh, thanks.
I'm gonna lose my house.
The only thing I have
is that house.
Uh, Mrs., uh...
Straka.
Uh, Maureen straka.
Is--is your son's
name Jake?
You know him?
Mrs. straka,
why don't you come--
you just tell
those bastards to hurry it,
'cause it's worth
1/4 million. Ok?
Those kids are waiting for you.
Pick your card.
Are you Mr. fallin?
Yes.
My name is Matthew damira.
This is my brother Justin.
Hi, Justin.
Shake his hand, Justin.
Louisa archer is my attorney.
Ok, well, you should probably
be speaking with her.
Just give me a minute.
My mother has some problems.
We haven't been living with
her for some time now.
We've been with the family
of our former social worker,
a woman named Suzanne diamond.
Ok.
She and her husband.
He's a radiologist.
They said they wanted
to adopt us both.
So, social services
went to see my mom
and had her sign this.
Adoption consent form.
Right.
It's for both of us.
Yeah.
But our foster parents,
the diamonds,
they decided, after
my mom signed the form,
they decided they didn't want
to adopt Justin anymore.
They only want to adopt me.
And Louisa archer
is agreeing with them.
Well, uh...
What do you want to do, Justin?
Unh!
I--I can't...
I can't...I...
Justin fell down
the stairs 3 years ago.
He's got brain damage,
which caused his dysarthria.
His--his what?
It's a medical condition,
caused by frontal lobe damage.
It affects his speech.
Anyway, he needs me
to help take care of him.
That's why we're here.
The adoption proceeding
is tomorrow,
and we need your help.
I am sentencing you
to 1,500 hours
of community service,
using your skills
as a corporate attorney
to work as a child advocate.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Matthew and Justin damira
came to see me.
To see you?
Yes, just--
they just left.
I was assigned
their case last week.
Why would they come to see you?
Maybe they don't like you.
What's going on with them?
They've been in and out of the
system for several years.
Matthew seems pretty smart.
Smart? He has 147 IQ.
And you know what?
You really should have sent Matthew in here.
Well, they don't want
to be separated.
I know that, but Matthew's
potential adoptive parents
have secured a place for him
at the garbrecht school
in Chicago.
It is the preeminent school for
gifted children in the nation.
It's--it's it.
It's a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity for him.
Matthew said something
about his former
social services
worker adopting him.
Mmm-hmm.
Suzanne diamond.
She worked with him
for almost 6 years.
Social services doesn't
see that as a conflict?
No. No,
they're recommending
that Matthew
go with the diamonds
and that Justin be placed
in the group shelter.
Hey--
Louisa, congratulations.
I just heard the good news.
Oh. Thanks.
Thanks, Alvin.
Did you hear?
Hear what?
I'm getting married.
Mom?
Hey, jakey.
Hi.
Hi.
Barbara.
Hey.
What's--
what's going on?
Mom?
Your mother came over
to legal services
looking for a lawyer.
I just didn't
want to bother you.
I'm just gonna sit over here.
So, are you and dad
getting a divorce?
What?
No, are you kidding?
Where would I go at my age?
What's going on?
Well, I was going
through some paperwork,
and I came across this
letter from this guy
that loaned
your father some money,
and it looks to me like they're
threatening to take our house.
I could go find a lawyer
that does this kind of work.
Ma, I do this kind of work.
Yeah, I know.
But, you know,
someone not so busy
or expensive.
Ma, please.
Is he gambling again?
He never stopped.
Ok, I'm gonna talk to him.
No! No, no.
Jakey, you can't let him
know that I did this.
He's a very private man.
He would be so embarrassed
if he knew that you and your
friend knew about this.
I will take care of it.
Ok, mom?
I just don't want
to lose our house.
Ma...You won't.
You promise?
Barbara, thanks.
Just come on
in my office. Ok?
Thanks for coming by.
Just please take a seat, Ms. diamond.
Oh, I'm sorry.
So, when did you leave
social services?
When my husband accepted a job
at the university of Chicago.
Oh, that's good.
That's good.
Ahem. So, can you
explain to me
how you ended up
adopting a child
from the family
who you once represented?
Matthew and I
bonded over the years.
His mother, Martha,
is slightly challenged.
Retarded.
Yes.
And when I first met him,
he was starving
for stimulation.
This was before
Justin's injury.
Did you bond
with Justin as well?
Oh, of course.
But in a different way.
Before his injury,
Justin was a tough kid.
Very physical, athletic.
Um, why aren't you
adopting Justin as well?
It didn't work out with
our daughter Hannah.
Justin's a sweet kid, but he has
a hard time editing himself...
Controlling himself.
He follows Hannah
around, stares at her,
walks in on her
in the bathroom.
She's very
uncomfortable with him.
Ok.
Thank you, Mrs. diamond.
She's cherry picking
the smart kid.
It's a little more
complicated than that.
Yeah, you're right.
She's cherry picking the smart kid
and she's dumping
the brain damaged brother.
She's also offering Matthew
a once-in-a-lifetime
situation.
Where's your ring?
Um...
It's kind of big,
so, you know, I usually--
where are you getting married?
Uh, I--Brian's parents'
country club.
Oh, really?
That's nice.
Really? You're not really
interested in this--
no, I am.
No, you're not.
So, the brothers
want to stay together.
Nick, this whole thing,
it's a simple
best-interest case.
For who?
The diamonds?
No, for Matthew and Justin.
I'm gonna support
Justin's wishes.
Why?
Why? It isn't fair.
Hey, ma.
Hey, look who's here.
Hi.
Mwah.
How are you?
What are you doing here?
It's the middle
of the work day.
Hi, dad.
You didn't get fired, did you?
Um, ma, would you
excuse us for a second?
Oh, sure.
What is it?
Ma was so worried, she
went looking for a lawyer.
This is my personal business.
You want to tell me
what's going on?
Just a few collection problems.
So, what?
Someone's not paying you?
It's
a misunderstanding--
so, just give me the details.
Come on, this isn't a big deal.
Dad, look, people
who lend money
to people with bad credit
are not exactly reasonable.
I got it under control.
So, you got the money
to pay these guys?
Well, not yet.
When are you gonna get it?
You sound like your mother.
Dad, I'm serious!
They can walk in here
and take your damn house.
Then let them have the house.
Ok. So, you may not mind
living in a crappy apartment,
but I think mom--
this is not
your place--
you're still going
to the track!
What the hell, Jake?
What the hell?
Don't you forget who put you
through school.
Oh, come on--
don't you forget who
worked a second job.
I haven't made a bet
in over 3 years.
Ok, dad...
Can you at least
tell me what happened?
Home warehouse moved in
a few Miles away.
To keep up,
I had to drop prices
and offer flexible credit.
I got more flexible
with my customers
than my suppliers got with me.
So, I'm gonna talk to the guys
who lent you the money...
If you don't mind.
Knock yourself out.
Hey.
Sorry.
Well, we finalized
the terms of the merger.
Tri-Ben is gonna buy off
the epsular stock
for $12 a share.
So, what do we do now?
Well, draft the agreement.
We should announce this,
uh, within 48 hours.
Ok. I'm on it.
Well, Nicholas,
you should get started
on the, uh, the merger proxy.
And made it clear
to the stockholders
that this is the best
deal out there. Ok?
$12 a share.
Last I heard, it was trading at 4.
Well, the s.E.C. Is
really all over this one.
They've called me 3 times.
So until they make
the terms public,
you shouldn't even talk
about this to each other.
Mrs. damira?
Um, yes?
Hi, my name is Nick fallin.
I represent your son Justin.
Yes?
Did you know
that Justin and Matthew
were being separated?
Why?
You signed a form, uh...
A consent to adopt form
a month ago?
I guess.
Do you remember?
Yes. Um, yes.
Uh, why did you sign it?
Because, um,
Mrs. Montgomery said
that she found a real good home
for Justin and Matthew.
When you went to court,
did the judge explain to you
what would happen
if you signed this form?
Yeah. She said
my rights would be over.
Terminated.
Yeah.
Did you have a lawyer
when you were in court?
Yeah.
Ok.
So, you know
that Matthew and Justin
are not being kept together?
No way I'd sign
a thing. No way.
My boys need to be together.
They can't be apart.
They need each other.
They can't be apart.
If you want to fight this,
then you have
to call your lawyer.
You have to call your lawyer.
Oh, no. I don't like
to go to court.
I don't--
I don't like that.
It's ok.
Ok.
That's nice.
It's Santa.
Yeah.
It's nice. Very nice.
Ok.
Mr. fritas?
I'm from fallin and associates.
I represent ed straka.
He asked me to look
into this matter.
Yeah, well, Mr. straka
signed a loan agreement
and consented to the terms.
He owes us $62,000.
And the original loan
was for $40,000?
Well, interest
compounds, does it not?
At 23%?
We expect our payment.
All right, well,
we need 3 weeks to secure
additional financing,
so we'd like to execute--
no. I want my money.
The way I see it,
Mr. fritas,
your loan documents
violate about a dozen
truth in lending regulations.
No, they don't.
Look, I've been in this
business for 15 years.
I started out as a lawyer
representing consumer
finance companies.
People come to me
when the big banks
won't risk a dime on them.
I take that risk.
You take advantage.
You think I'm scum?
Nah.
Truth, I'm just
providing credit
to people who can't
get it anywhere else.
I've weighed the testimony
of social services,
of miss archer,
and the diamonds.
Matthew, the diamonds appear
to be an excellent home
for you.
Your honor, the brothers
want to be kept together.
Your honor, Mr.
fallin is representing Justin damira,
who has no standing--
he's Matthew damira's brother.
Legally, they're not
brothers anymore.
Their sibling relationship
ended when their mother
terminated her parental rights.
Mr. fallin,
you have no standing here.
Matthew, I've read the reports.
I know you don't want to be
separated from your brother,
but I believe the facts
support miss archer
and social services'
recommendation.
It is hereby ordered
that Matthew damira
be adopted by doctor
and Mrs. diamond.
What did that mean?
Well, at this stage,
it means that
the diamonds will take
Matthew to Chicago.
- Matthew!
- I'll go, I'll go.
No, I'll do it.
Justin, it doesn't
work this way.
What are you boys gonna do?
You gonna live in a park?
We can get another lawyer
and apply for
new foster parents.
Damn you!
Ok, you listen to me.
Listen, I'm gonna step outside,
and I'm gonna get
a bailiff in here
to take you out. Ok?
I'm sorry.
I'll follow you in my car
to the group shelter
to make sure you're ok.
So?
So, they're gonna
take the house.
And legally, it'll hold up.
I could have gotten a $50-an-hour
lawyer to tell me that.
All right, well,
I'm telling you.
And the way I see it,
you got 2 sets of problems.
You got corporate debt
and you got personal debt.
Any, <i>any</i> of your customers
owe you any money?
Sure. All of them.
How much?
Damianos owes me
about 10 grand.
Smithson, about 15 grand.
How long are they overdue?
Months.
Ok, well, you gotta
get that money.
I can't.
They're old friends.
Tell that to mom when they're
taking away her house.
You don't understand the first
thing about how we do business.
It's a small group of guys.
I push too hard,
they start to complain.
They complain,
they don't come back.
Dad, dad, they don't pay
you, you close up shop.
If they're such bad
customers, what the hell--
they're broke, Jake.
We're all broke,
except milt dallesandro.
He actually went in with
those home warehouse guys.
Dad, look.
The way I see it,
you need to sue those
2 guys for the money.
Jake, you don't get it.
There's nothing
to sue them for.
It'd be like suing me.
- Take it easy. Take it easy!
- Unh! Aah!
Let me go!
Aah!
I'm Justin's lawyer.
Leave him alone.
Can you give us a moment?
Don't you hit me.
Ok. I'm gonna
fight this, Justin. Ok?
What I need you to do
now is I need you
to go inside
and behave the best--
I don't wanna
live in this place!
No, I understand, just
give me a couple of days.
I heard about what you were
like before the accident.
You're tough, smart.
You still are.
I'm gonna go back into court,
I'm gonna fight your
brother's adoption. Ok?
Aah! Rrr!
There is still a way
you two can be together.
Unh!
Ok?
I think he's fine.
My dad grew up in ambridge,
went to vo-tech and learned
to become a plumber.
When I was a kid, he opened
a supply and repair shop
in aliquippa, on the main drag,
and he did ok.
I mean, he kept us in groceries
and, uh, helped
get me through pitt.
Yeah?
Well, he's been
doing business his way
for the past
35 years, and, uh...
That's just not the way
it works anymore, man.
I think he can change.
I mean, look, he has to--
he has to change.
But, uh...
He's, uh...
Well, he's just in a bit
over his head right now.
Yeah.
I don't understand.
I need an advance on my salary.
What kind of advance?
$50,000.
Oh.
Jake, I've always
maintained a policy
not to advance or
loan to my employees.
Well, I'm good for it.
I'm sure you are, but
if something goes wrong
it gets, uh...
A little complicated.
You don't have to pay me a
cent for the next 4 months.
Well, the problem is, Jake,
if I do that for you,
then, uh, you know, they'll
expect the same, and...
Burton, it's my dad's business.
Well, why don't you, uh,
why don't you just go
to the p.A. Savings
and loan?
Yeah. No, I--
I already did.
Uh, they can only
give me 15,000, so...
Jake, look, I'm sorry,
but I'm not
in the loan business.
They are. I'm not. Ok?
I'm sorry.
Mom, what happened?
That man fritas
came by, with this.
He said we have 30 days
to move out of our house.
I'm gonna get a drink.
I can't stand that man.
Ma...
What am I gonna do, jakey?
Where am I gonna go?
We have nothing left.
No savings, nothing.
Your father goes to the
track almost every day.
He doesn't care.
Ma...
I'm gonna take
care of you. Ok?
You're not supposed to do that.
I will, ma.
It's gonna be ok.
I just want to keep my house.
I just want to keep my house.
Ah, Lulu. Could you step
in here a minute, please?
Nick has approached me
about representing
Matthew and Justin
damira's wishes.
How?
He wants to file a motion to
vacate the diamond adoption.
So, you're taking me
off the case?
No. You'll continue
as Matthew's guardian
and maintain your position
for best interests.
Nick just wants
to represent their wishes.
Nick's trying
to make an end run
to get this back in court.
They made best efforts to
keep those kids together.
They gave Matthew to the
first person in line,
and they're letting
Justin fend for himself.
No. Alvin...
It's only fair, Lulu.
If Matthew were 12,
he'd be able to stop
this adoption himself.
Thank you.
Why are you doing this?
Because it isn't fair.
It feels like ever since
Brian came to town--
no. It's not
personal, Lulu.
Well, at the incline the other
night, you were very angry--
you were the one that stormed
out of the restaurant.
Well, you were being
very offensive.
Was I?
You were.
You know you were
talking about me
following Brian around
and screwing up my life.
Why do you have a problem
with what I do with my life?
'Cause he wants you
to be a housewife.
Mom...
I made the call to that guy.
The broker.
Yeah?
And he said to send the money.
So, I went to the mailbox
place and I wired it.
$15,000.
I no sooner got home,
and he called.
He wanted to know if he
should buy the stock.
And then he did, and
then the money was gone.
You know? It was kind of
exciting, all that money.
And so, then I--I turned
on your father's TV,
and, uh, to that
station where they have
the stock thingies.
You know?
And I look for the symbol
for epsular, and...
It was like magic.
It was like magic, jakey.
$45,000!
We made $45,000 today!
I can't wait to tell your father.
I can't wait.
Hey, man.
You wanted to speak with me?
No, thanks.
Nick...
I take my addiction seriously.
I mean, I realize it in myself,
and I deal with my addiction
every waking moment of my life.
You know, Phil, you
don't have to tell me
about yourself.
It's ok.
What about you, Nick?
What?
Do you think
you have a problem,
or do you think
you just got caught?
Well, I've been coming
to these meetings
3 times a week
for the last 8 months.
I haven't missed one.
That's the easy part.
I do my work, I meet with
my probation officer--
you didn't answer my question.
Do you think
you have a problem?
I have a problem
getting caught, Phil.
You stood before us and
admitted to using again.
Yeah. I mean, think about that.
Think about how lucky you are.
I mean, what if a random
drug test had come up?
Or what if something
really bad had happened?
Yeah.
Hey, Alvin.
You know Alvin,
don't you, Nick?
Hey, Nick.
Oh, yeah.
Alvin's offered to be
your new sponsor, Nick.
Only if you want me to be.
You should have seen his face.
Russell was just terrified.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
I get it.
It's--it's...
You know, we had a great
time at the concert,
but if you don't
want to do this--
wait. Wait, wait. No.
This is not about you.
Are you sure?
I promise.
You want to talk about it?
It's just this stuff
with my mom and dad.
Anything I can do to help?
No. I mean...
I mean,
I took care of it, so...
You loaned them the money.
Well, in a way.
Yeah. I mean...
They can keep the house now.
You're a great son, Jake.
That's just the greatest
thing to be able to have.
To be so successful...
You know, Barbara, um...
I'm--I'm really
kind of bad company tonight.
Can we--
can we do this another time?
Oh. Ok.
Well, yeah. Ok.
Ok.
Great. I mean,
I'll call you. Ok?
Yeah.
All right?
Thanks.
No problem.
Come in.
Burton, you wanted to see me?
Sit down, Jake.
You told your mother
about epsular?
What--what happened?
The s.E.C. Called
this morning.
Oh, my God.
Burton, look.
Let me just tell you what happened.
I'm assuming she got the
information indirectly.
No, Burton. I was--
Jake, don't disabuse
me of my notion.
Your mother got the information
because she overheard
you on the phone.
Well, that's all, Jake.
Janet Montgomery promised me.
What did she promise you?
That my boys
would be kept together.
Did she tell you
who was planning
on adopting your boys?
No.
Would you have
terminated your rights
had you known
it was Suzanne diamond?
No.
Why not?
Miss diamond was never
real nice to me.
Please describe to the court how
Justin's brain damage occurred.
Um...My boyfriend
was punishing Matthew.
Um, Justin got
in the middle of it,
and Ron pushed him.
They were by the stairs.
Mrs. damira...
Is this your signature?
Um, yes.
Paragraph 4 of this form reads,
"I understand I may not
revoke this consent
once the court enters a
termination or adoption decree."
Mrs. damira, is there
anything that you
don't understand
about these words?
It--it says I'm--
it says I can't
get my kids back.
No further questions.
Ahem.
Martha, do you understand
what the word decree means?
No.
Do you understand what
the word revoke means?
Revoke.
Did you even read this
before you signed it?
No.
We may file criminal charges.
Rob, I am certain
that Maureen straka
was unaware there
was a pending merger.
I'm talking about her son Jake.
It was a mistake, rob.
Just an innocent mistake.
She heard her son
talking on the phone.
There's no intent there.
This is
a 63-year-old housewife.
You're talking like
she's part of some
insider trading ring.
Can you prove
it was inadvertent?
Can you prove it wasn't?
Look, let me...
Let me see if I can
get the money back.
If I go for this...
I need your word that Jake
straka will never work
on another merger transaction.
Rob, that's--
that's what we do here.
You're basically
making him useless to me.
This could be
a lot worse for you
than benching
an associate, Burton.
A lot worse.
Jake...
The s.E.C.
Is expecting a check
for a little bit more
than 50,000 by 5:00 today.
I recommend that you
and your mother
hand-deliver it
and then kiss their ass
for their kindness.
Burton, look--
that's--
that's all, Jake.
Social services and the diamonds
lived up to their promises.
For 6 months, the diamonds
attempted to incorporate both boys
into their family,
but unfortunately,
it didn't work.
Now, what this case
really boils down to
is a very simple legal issue.
Can a parent revoke
a valid adoption decree
simply because
she's changed her mind,
or because she doesn't like the
prospective adoptive parents?
It's not the way things
are done, your honor.
Let the adoption stand.
Mrs. damira's consent
was not knowing, voluntary,
and deliberate.
In fact, this whole adoption
was premised on a fraud
perpetrated
on Mrs. damira.
She was led to believe
that her 2 sons
would be kept together.
Furthermore, the brothers
wanted to be kept together.
Now, had social services
bothered to look,
they might have found a family that
was willing to adopt both brothers,
but they didn't.
They reneged on their promise to Mrs.
damira.
That alone is grounds
to vacate this order.
I find that Martha damira
knowingly and voluntarily
relinquished her rights.
But I also find
that social services
made representations
to Mrs. damira
that her 2 sons
would be kept together.
More effort has to be made to
honor those representations.
I'm vacating the adoption.
Matthew damira will be placed in
a group shelter with his brother
until a more suitable
situation can be found.
Your honor-- your honor,
that could take months,
and who knows what the
damage will be to Matthew--
I'm Nicholas fallin.
I just received a call from
my client Justin damira.
Ok, thank you.
Hey.
Hi, Mr. fallin.
Hi.
Can I...Talk to you?
What is it?
Matthew...Doesn't
bel-long here.
He's...Go-onna say
he w-wants to stay,
but he was cr-ying
all night.
Justin says you
don't like the group shelter.
No. The group
shelter's fine.
I'm not that interested
in other kids anyway.
I'm more interested in reading
books or using the Internet.
Plus, Justin and I
are in the same room.
And I can go to the
magnet program for math.
W-why were
you cr-ying?
It wasn't because
of the group shelter.
I was thinking
of something else.
M-Matthew,
you tell them...
The truth.
You...Wanna go.
Is that what you want, Matthew,
to go with the diamonds?
Will you all step out in
the hall a moment, please?
Mr. fallin,
stick around.
You can be
an arrogant ass, you know?
You've managed to vilify
2 very good women,
humiliate a colleague,
and for what?
This could be a permanent
separation for these kids.
We're not talking about
placing them
in different homes
in the same city
where they can see each
other and see their mother.
These boys love each other.
They love their mom.
I didn't do this for any
reason other than the fact
that they should not
be torn apart.
Does Justin really want his
brother to go with the diamonds?
Yes.
Then tell the boys
I'll reverse my decision.
Jake.
Can I see you in my office?
Burton, listen, um...
I just wanna say thank you
for standing up for me.
Sit down, Jake.
Jake, I'm afraid we're
gonna have to discuss
how this whole thing
affects your future here.
My--my--my future?
Yeah.
I had to make some
promises to clear this up.
I had to promise gersh
that you would never be
involved with any...
Public securities.
For how long?
Forever.
At least for now.
I--I been doing corporate
for 7 years now.
Well, that should have been
long enough for you to discover
that you don't disclose
insider information.
Well, uh, tell me, Burton,
I mean, is there still
a place for me here?
I think that's up to you.
I mean, if you can
pick up enough work
to justify your overhead.
Absolutely.
Ok.
Oh, Jake,
this, um...
This is for the next 6 months.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Hi, dad.
- You and your mother.
- Now you know.
What?
How it feels to gamble,
huh, and lose.
I think you gave her
quite a thrill, jakey.
I think she sees me in an
entirely new light, you know?
I paid off the loan.
Thank you.
Don't thank me. I bought the title.
I own the house now.
What about my business?
I'm sorry, dad.
No one's gonna give you that money.
No one's gonna take that risk.
I'm gonna have to close
this place down?
I'm sorry, dad.
Look, maybe, uh...
Maybe it's better this way.
I--I went over to
home warehouse, ok?
And I spoke to milt dallesandro.
He said they're hiring.
He said they need help in
the plumbing department.
The pay is ok, and the
benefits are good.
How am I gonna close this
place down after 35 years?
How am I gonna do it?
These are the, uh, these are
the bankruptcy papers. Um...
It's--it's not such
a big deal, believe me.
I can help you.
You don't have to make
up your mind right now,
but you really should do this
before your creditors
come after you again.
All right.
Hey.
Hey.
Thanks for meeting me.
I'm...Surprised
you called.
I'm sorry about yesterday.
I was in the middle
of some problems,
and I just didn't
want to burden you.
No, it's ok.
No, but I really enjoy
spending time with you,
and I just didn't
mean to be a jerk.
Oh...
Your parents?
Yeah.
Oh, God.
My mother drives me nuts.
She wants to go to bingo and
buffet every Saturday night.
Saturday night
in mt. Aire.
My mother, uh, competes
in pie-baking contests.
Oh!
Demands I go.
Ha ha!
And do you?
I haven't missed one yet.
Ha ha ha!
You wouldn't, um...
Wanna come play bingo this
Saturday night, would ya?
Hell, yeah.
Bring one of your mom's pies.
I'm gonna bring my mom!
Perfect!
Leave the pies at home. Yeah.
Yes?
About your, uh, ahem--
your offer, uh...
Yes?
I--I guess it'd be ok.
Ok.
Don't expect me to
call you or anything.
Ok.
'Cause I don't--
I don't need, uh...
I don't need anyone.
Fine, Mr. fallin.
Just call me Nick, will you?
Ok? That's enough with the Mr.
fallin thing.
Fine.
Nick.
Good. Good.
Yeah.
Good night.
Hey.
Matthew's headed to Chicago.
Yeah, I heard.
So it's, uh, all worked out now.
Yeah.
Ok.
Nick.
About this week...
Yeah?
We were having a--a
professional argument, right?
It was a professional
disagreement, and...
It didn't have
anything to do with--
no, of course not.
I am happy for you.
Thank you.
'Cause I don't know.
It just, um...
It didn't seem like you to...
To do something so, uh...
So what?
Emotional.
Well, I was
representing my client.
Being professional.
That's right.
Good, then.
'Cause, uh...
I--I think that that's...
I think that's
the best way for us to be.
Professional.
Right.
Good night.
