(<i> knocking</i> )
(<i> humming</i> )
Hey!
Hi, guys,
come on in!
Mom... Dad.
(<i> laughing</i> )
Hey, Dad.
Come here, you skinny.
-Come on in, you guys.
Come on in.
How was the flight?
Oh, don't ask.
I nearly died of embarrassment.
Why?
I always pre-order
the kosher meal
because they have
to make it special.
Right.
But this time, they didn't
bring enough on the plane
so they made me give my
lunch to this Jewish guy.
Your father demanded
that the man flip a coin for it.
Fair's fair, Natalie. -Made
him go two out of three.
Dad... Sorry, I'm still
getting unpacked here.
So, uh, what do
you guys think?
Not bad, Eddie, not bad.
But me,
I loved your New York place.
I miss that view
of the Chrysler Building.
Yeah, Dad, but, you know
now I have my own backyard,
my own garage, and...
the guy next door
<i> drives</i> a Chrysler
so I got a great view of<i> that.</i>
Oh, I got a lovely card
from Liz.
Says she's moved to SoHo.
Sounds so bohemian, SoHo.
You talked to her?
-No, actually, I don't.
Talk to her lawyer quite a bit, though.
Oh, please, you guys, have a seat.
What kind of rent they charging
these days in Stuckeyville?
Actually, Dad, I bought
the place... lock, stock
and plastic upholstery covers.
What? -We thought you
were just taking a break.
A break? DAD: You know?
From your real life.
This is my real life.

MOLLY:  So, how was your
weekend? -Not bad. How about you?
I watched a lot of
basketball. -How come?
The girls' JV basketball
team needs a new coach.
You know, I think I
might apply for the job.
Well, what happened to the
old coach? -Oh, she quit.
Day after their 47th
consecutive loss.
Wow!
Yeah, it's a new
school record.
Anyway, Coach Carlisle's talking
about ending the JV program
which won't exactly
do wonders
for the girls'
self-esteem.
I think you should
do that, Molly.
Yeah, yeah.
Plus, I have always
wanted to yell
"Hey! Hit the showers,
you punks!"
Hi.
PHIL:
Chief?
The kids stole the "T" again.
This just keeps getting funnier.
Molly Hudson?
Oh, my...
Agnes Bushner!
AGNES:
It's been forever.
You look exactly the same.
Yeah, well, you know
minus the Psychedelic
Furs T-shirt.
Well, oh, um
Carol, sweetie?
Y-you remember Agnes...
We, we were classmates.
Oh, yeah. Hi.
Agnes, how are you? -Fine. You?
Great, great.
It, it's really good
to see you again.
Uh-huh.
Listen, uh, I'll be
in town all week.
We<i> have</i> to get together.
I'll call you.
Okay. Bye, Aggie!
Bye.
Bye, Aggie... ness.
What can I do for you, Phil?
No, you're doing it,
my man.
I just love
watching you work.
It's poetry in motion.
I can never tell where
the admiration leaves off
and the condescension begins.
So, what's the story?
The Feds finally busting
this little dog and pony show?
Close.
My parents are visiting.
I want them to see I'm running
a serious law practice
so I'm playing down
this bowling alley thing.
"Surely you jest",
he said, chuckling.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
And Phil, I'd like
to ask you a favor.
Want me to hide
the bowling balls?
No, I'd like
you to...
to...
look, don't take this
the wrong way.
When my parents get here,
could you try to...
I mean, could you...
not that I don't like you
the way you are.
Spit it out, Edward.
We're all friends here.
Could you try being
a little less Phil.
(<i> bowling pins crash</i> )
What I mean by that...
No, no, no.
No, I read you loud
and clear, senor.
Don't worry your
pretty little head.
Really?
That would be great.
I won't have to worry...
Uh-oh.
Here they come.
Oh, why don't you let me
stash that away for you.
Oh, thanks, Phil.
No, thank you, Ed.
Hey!
You guys.
Hi, honey.
Hi.
Welcome to the,
uh, law offices
of Edward J. Stevens, Esquire.
Where?
Right here.
My very own law office.
I didn't realize
your office was actually
<i>inside</i> the bowling alley.
Adjacent to the bowling alley,
adjacent to the bowling alley.
Once you pass through
this doorway
you're no longer
in a bowling alley.
You're in a law office.
I'm still in a bowling alley.
You're not looking at this
the right way.
Think of it
as a strip mall
where there's, uh
separate businesses
sharing the same...
physical edifice.
My son works
in a bowling alley.
Do your clients
have to change their shoes
before you meet with them?
No, Mom, they don't.
Of all the withering looks
I've gotten
that was by far
the most withering.
I thought my<i> face</i> was,
was going to melt off
like at the end of
<i> Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>
where they open that,
that box.
Ark.
Right.
Does this strike anyone else as
just a<i> tiny</i> bit ironic?
How so?
Well, you know, head
cheerleader Carol Vessey
worrying about what nerdy little
Agnes Bushner thinks of her?
Come on, I was never anything
but nice to her.
What?
Nothing, I-I-I mean...
you were never outright<i> mean</i>
to her.
But...?
But, y-you never went
out of your way to be nice
to people like her...
or... us.
But I never even knew you guys
back then.
That's just it.
Agnes never got a chance
to get to know<i> you</i>
the way that,
that we do now.
So she still
thinks of you
the way she did
in high school...
you know,
the way we all did.
Which would be how, exactly?
You know what,
you have<i> got</i> to taste
this shepherd's pie.
I... this is
shepherdlicious!
Mmm!
Mmm, mmm.
ED: Then I thought, "Wait a minute.
"Stuckeyville Stan's entire<i> act</i>
can be considered
his intellectual property,
not just his tricks."
He doesn't have to own the
tricks; he owns the<i> act.</i>
That's pretty neat, huh?
DAD: When we visited
you last year in New York
you were working
on a $300 billion merger
that changed the structure
of the national
economy.
To me, that was neat.
Yes, Dad, yes, but back then
I was working for corporations.
Now I work for people.
Party clowns.
Magicians, actually.
Just one... so far.
(<i> knocking</i> )
Excuse me.
Phil... uh, Mom, Dad
this is... Phil.
Hi.
Hello. -So nice to meet you.
Can I get you some coffee?
Do you have some Sanka? -You
bet. Ed, there are some gentlemen
waiting here to see you.
Shall I have them wait, or...
No, send them in. Yeah.
Thank... you... Phil.
Um, Mom, Dad, why don't you, uh, stick
around watch me help these clients?
Send in the clowns.
(<i> groans</i> )
Third time this month... kids.
They think
this is funny.
Well, this ain't funny.
<i>-Family Feud.</i>
What? <i>-Family Feud</i> is funny.
I love it when they're playing
the Feud and somebody guesses
an answer, and their whole
family starts shouting
"Good answer! Good answer!"
But then they get it wrong
and Louie Anderson says
something hilarious.
Louie Anderson is a genius.
I prefer
<i> The All-New Hollywood Squares.</i>
Why? -I got a thing for Whoopie.
I'm Frank. This is my
buddy, Dave. -Hi, Ed Stevens.
These are my parents. You guys
mind if they hang out while we talk?
Are they cool?
-You can trust them.
I have always been able to
tell when people are cool.
It is like a gift.
And I can see that this
man and this woman are cool.
Natalie, let's go.
ED: Dad, dad, please.
Just...
What can I do for you guys?
-We got serious trouble.
You're being sued
by Ted Schmidt
former co-worker
at Stuckeyville Container.
The box factory on the north
side. -We are box makers, by trade.
You see that box? -Yes.
We made that box. -Is that
right? -With giant machines.
ED: Okay. So, why is
this guy suing you?
Well, things can get a little
dull down at the plant, so, uh
us guys started playing pranks
on each other...
you know, just to make life
more interesting.
Once I filled
another man's shoes
with nondairy whipped topping.
A good time was had by all.
ED: So, uh, this guy just
got upset over a little prank?
A big prank.
A very big prank.
This is the nicest "T" we've ever
had. I hope they don't steal it.
They won't. I'm going to hide
up here, catch them red-handed
and drag them down to
juvie. You want to help?
Okay.
Mols, Mols.
Have you signed up
for that coaching job yet?
No, not yet.
I was on my way
down to the gym.
Hmm, how would
you feel
about letting me
do it instead?
You want to coach
JV basketball. Why?
Because I have
a basketball jones.
Our little run-in
with Agnes Bushner
really got to you, huh?
Yeah, it did.
And I want to help
those girls out.
Besides, why should
you always get to be
the champion
of the underdog?
I know you think I spent
my high school years
in top of the world,
but the fact is
I frequently felt
like an underdog.
Okay, I-I'm sorry, sweetie,
but you were not an underdog.
You, my friend,
were an overdog.
An overdog?
An overdog.
So, the prank?
It's a little complicated.
May I?
Absolutely,
by all means.
Good evening.
Your Lotto
Madness jackpot...
Please, take this
lottery ticket.
WOMAN:
...$20 million.
Okay.
Now, pay attention.
WOMAN: Tonight's
winning numbers are...
34...
ten...
28...
three...
49...
and 24.
Good luck.
This is a wi...
this is a winning ticket.
Oh, my God!
Ed, hold on to that ticket!
That ticket is yours.
You gave that ticket to my son.
It's his property. Now run, run!
Frank:
Buddy, relax.
The tape
is from last Wednesday.
But we bought the ticket
on Friday
using Wednesday's numbers.
I get it.
So the ticket's worthless.
So, Dad,
you can sit down.
You see, this guy, Ted...
he's a lottery freak.
Yeah, man, he buys, like,
20 tickets a week.
It is his obsession.
FRANK: So, we put
this ticket in his pile
then when it was time
for the drawing
we slipped that tape
into the VCR.
So he thought he won.
And I guess when he found
out he didn't he got upset.
He just needs a couple
of days to cool off.
There's a little bit more to it
than that.
When Ted thought he'd become
a millionaire
he went nuts.
He quit his job,
and he left his wife.
Ooh.
Now he's holding us
responsible.
We did not mean
to cause him pain.
Will you take the case?
He's not taking
the case.
What do you want me to do? Sit
here and fiddle while Rome burns?
I'll take the case.
Thank you.
(<i> man clearing throat</i> )
Excuse me. Uh,
is my son around?
No, Mr. Stevens,
I'm afraid he stepped out.
Is there something
I can help you with?
Theater tickets?
Dinner reservations?
A very fun little Cajun place
just opened up.
No. No, thanks.
Okay, well... I'll be sure
and tell Ed you dropped by.
You have a good day, now.
Uh, listen, Phil...
You changed your mind
about the Cajun. Terrific.
They have popcorn shrimp
that are to die for.
No. We're concerned
about our son.
One day he's in New
York City, married
on the fast track,
the next day he's back here...
renting shoes.
I mean, it's like
something stopped.
I wasn't going
to say anything, but...
Yeah?
I've been very worried myself.
Frankly... I think he's lost it.
Do you have any idea
what's behind this? Well...
there's the girl, of course.
What girl?
Hasn't he told you
about Carol Vessey?
Who's Carol Vanessey?
Oh, Mr. Stevens.
Mr. Dumford?
Yeah?
I'm Ed Stevens. The attorney.
We spoke on the phone.
Uh-huh.
(<i> clears throat</i> )
I'm he■■re to ask u
to give Ted Schmidt
his job back.
I'm sorry. I can't do that. Look...
Mr. Dumford,
the only reason the guy quit
was because he thought
he won the lottery.
But if you let him come back
to work, perhaps he'd drop
his lawsuit
against Frank and David.
Those guys have worked for you
for a long time.
You'd really be helping them
out of a jam.
Ted Schmidt didn't just quit.
He insulted me.
Oh... I'm sure he...
I can forgive that
but what I cannot,
will not forgive
is that he insulted
this company and its products.
Well, I... He looked
me right in the face
and he said,
"Boxes... who needs them?"
Well, I don't...
And I will tell you
who needs boxes, Mr. Stevens.
We all do.
You would not want to live
in a world without boxes.
You could not survive a<i> day</i>
in such a world.
Oh, yeah, you think you could
but you are wrong.
You must be the Stevens.
I'm Carol Vessey.
Oh, hello, Carol.
Please call me Alan.
Alan. Hi.
I'm Natalie.
It's so nice to meet
you. Nice to meet you.
Thanks so much for
having me to lunch.
Is, um, is Ed
running late?
Oh, Ed won't be joining us.
Oh. Did something come up?
Carol, dear
what we discuss
at this table
has to stay between
the three of us.
Okay?
Okay.
Well, uh, Carol,
I'll make things very simple.
Your relationship with our son
is none of our business.
We don't care how
or why you talked him
into buying that bowling alley.
What? I-I-I...
Please, dear,
just listen to Alan.
What will it take to get you to
relinquish your hold on my son?
My... my hold?
Uh, Natalie,
could I have the checkbook?
What?
$500... if you can talk my son
into moving back to New York.
Mr. Stevens...
-$1.000?
Uh... Okay, you know what? It-it-it's
time for basketball practice
and I'm going
to get going now.
Thank you so much for
having me to lunch.
Uh... Can we get you
something to go?
Anything? -I can see cars.
For tonight, we should get
night-vision giggles.
Like<i> Silence of the Lambs.</i>
Except we wouldn't be the killers.
Uh-huh. I loved
Jodie Foster in that.
She's tough yet feminine.
Clarice was the archetype
for the modern female hero.
Intelligence
and nonthreatening beauty
combined with moderate
physical strength
and a strong but not
unbreakable moral code.
Did you make that up?
No, it was on<i> TV Guide</i> Channel.
That's a good channel.
(<i> blowing whistle</i> )
Okay, everybody,
for those of you
who don't know me
I am Coach Vessey, and I am here
to help you
turn your season around.
<i>You're</i> the new coach?
Yes. So try to contain
that enthusiasm, Jenny.
I'm just surprised
that a former Miss Teen USA
would want to bother with us.
Well, I was never Miss Teen USA.
Oh.
I guess it's
just a rumor.
Well, rumor aside, um...
I am here because
you are a great group of girls
and you deserve to know
what it feels like
to win a game or two.
So everybody on your feet.
Let's go.
(<i> blowing whistle</i> )
Come on. Everybody up.
(<i> blowing whistle</i> )
We're going to start
with a little basket-making.
Basket-making?
Yeah.
Yeah, basket-making. Um...
Are the baskets
always that high?
Uh, they stopped lowering
them for us last month.
Okay...
so for now we'll work on,
uh, ball-throwing.
Everybody get into pairs
and each-each pair
takes a ball.
We've only got one ball.
Um...
One ball?
One ball's not a problem.
We are going
to take turns
bouncing this ball
and whoever
bounces the ball highest
wins a Fruit Roll-up.
So, I'm going to go first.
Okay.
Um...
Calisthenics.
Let's go. Everybody, now.
No, I'm afraid I can't let you
bowl with that...
it's too bouncy.
I need to know everything there
is to know about basketball
and I need to know it
by tomorrow.
I'm going to give you guys
the most basic building block
of basketball strategy:
the pick-and-roll.
Invented in 1894 by Herbert
Pick and Alfred Roll.
Really?
No.
Okay, teach me, teach
me. -All right, okay, okay.
To start off, you gals
guard Mike and I, all right?
Nancy, you guard Mike.
Carol, you guard me.
All right, now...
All right, now,
step one, okay?
Step one... Mike steps up
and sets what's called
a "pick." There it is.
Step two... I drive
to the basket
thereby forcing Nancy to switch
Oh, oh. -...from guarding
Mike to guarding me.
When this occurs
you go to step three...
Mike<i> rolls.</i>
I hit him with the pass.
Mike scores.
We go home heroes!
Carol: Yeah! Okay,
that's really sneaky.
I like it.
Now you try it. You
try it. Let's go, buddy.
That's allowed.
That's called a "basketball
pat"... it's allowed.
I see. I even called you "buddy."
All right, let's go.
Pick-and-roll. Okay, okay.
WOMAN (<i> on TV</i> ):
49... and 24.
Good luck.
TED: Oh, my God... Oh,
my■■ God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
I've just won the lottery!
I just won the lottery.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
I just won $20 million!
$20 million!
Mill... ion!
(<i> laughing</i> )
You know what, Mr. Dumford?
I am out of here!
You're quitting?
Am I quitting?
Mr. Dumford...
Art, you can kiss
my $20 million
on the way out the door.
MAN:
Dude, wait...
You know why I'm
quitting? 'Cause you suck.
Because this
company sucks!
Because boxes suck!
Who even needs
boxes anyway?
I repeat: they suck!
Mr. Zelter, would you care to
tell the court what happened next?
Well, he ran off before
I could tell him the truth.
Then he went home and told
his wife he was leaving her.
Why did you and Mr. Gersky
play this silly prank
on Mr. Schmidt?
You know, for laughs.
We're always playing jokes
on each other down there.
Last week
Jim Stackhouse put a live ferret
in Arnie Scaputo's locker.
That was hilarious.
Did you have any reasonable
expectation that Mr. Schmidt
on thinking
that he won the lottery
would suddenly up and quit
and leave his wife?
No, sir.
In fact
when Mr. Schmidt
began unexpectedly
telling his boss Mr. Dumford
that he might quit his job
what did you do?
That was me rushing in,
saying, "Dude, dude
wait, dude."
Thank you.
Okay, Susan, you're going
to set the pick on Sabrina.
That means Laura, you've got
to guard Jenny. There you go.
Now, Jenny, roll out
to the basket, Susan.
Roll out. Jenny, pass to her.
There you go. There you go.
Yes! That's it!
That is a pick-and-roll.
(<i> all cheering</i> )
You testified that
you and Mr. Gersky
had no idea that my
client Mr. Schmidt
would behave
the way he did.
Is that right?
That's right.
Ever hear him
complain about his job?
Well, yeah, but we
all moan... -In fact,
when he sat down every week
to watch those lotto drawings
didn't he ever say
something to the effect, uh
"If I win, I'm moving
to some desert island"
or "Hey, take a good
look at me, boys.
"When one of these
tickets cashes in
I'm leaving this rat hole"?
Well, yeah, but that
was just talk. Really?
Turned out not
to be just talk
didn't it?
Hello.
Little spin. Oh!
Good-bye!
I like that.
I'm going to teach
that to the girls.
That little spin
and the pick-and-roll
have won many a
basketball game, my friend.
Ed, you should have seen
the girls today.
They were picking,
and they were rolling
and they were laughing, and...
I know this sounds
really corny
but it's like they were
brand-new people
all of a sudden.
That's great. You know, you're
really doing some good there.
Yeah. And I think that there's
something I have to tell you.
Oh, Carol, I already know
about your attraction for me.
Just let's quit torturing ourselves
and let's start doing it already.
It's about your parents.
What about my parents?
-They had lunch with me.
They had lunch with you?
Actually, they wanted me
to try to convince you
to go back to New York.
What?
They offered me $1.000. -What?!
-I just wanted you to know.
You know... I-I give up.
You know, I'm just...
I'm going to ask them to leave.
-No, no, no. Ed, don't do that.
Why should I not do that? They
obviously think their son's a loser.
I saw them in court today.
They were looking at me
like my life's
some kind of joke.
They liked me back in New
York... the wife and the big job
at a prestigious
New York City law firm
handling million-dollar
clients, and now...
now they...
they just don't get it.
Do you think your life
was better back then?
Well, uh, maybe...
maybe it was on paper, but...
"But..."
Back then I never got
to play basketball
on a weekday afternoon.
Ha!
Whoo!
Nice shot!
Buddy!
(<i> laughing</i> )
I don't know how
they got it again.
We were only gone
a little while.
Once again,
we are "Suckey Bowl."
I think the thieves
are masters of deception
not unlike illusionist
David Copperfield.
Once I saw him
turn a fat guy into a pony.
He's a real showman.
Uh... there you go.
Thanks, boss.
There he is.
Hey, hey, you guys
can I talk to you
two for a minute?
Sure. Of course. Okay. So far, I've
been very patient with the two of you,
but this time, you have gone
too far. -Honey, you seem upset.
Seem upset... seem upset?
Ma, are you kidding me?
Don't speak to your
mother that way.
Sorry.
Look, are either of you
going to tell me
about your lunch
with Carol Vessey?
We didn't have lunch
with Carol Vessey.
Alan.
Natalie, he may
be bluffing.
Dad, you offered her $1,000
to convince me to move back
to New York City.
Do you have any idea
how humiliating that is?
Ed, now listen to me.
When we came here, we
were worried about you.
We're parents.
We're allowed.
So, we... we poked
around a little.
I'm sorry.
The truth is, we
learned something.
We learned that
you're happy here.
I watched you
in court today
and I saw
a certain look in your eye
I never saw when you worked
with that Wall Street firm.
What your father's
trying to say, dear
is now we know that
you're in the right place.
You're where you should be.
Really?
Really.
So, we're headed
back for Florida.
What? When?
We're leaving
for the airport now.
Now... why so soon?
Our work here is done.
Good-bye, son.
Good-bye, darling.
Bye, Dad.
Bye, Mom.
(<i> mumbling</i> )
Hi.
In honor of your complete
mastery of the pick-and-roll
I have good news
and I have great news.
First, the good news.
My cousin works at Shirt Palace
over at the mall
cut me a deal on these:
new uniforms.
Names on the back,
numbers, the works.
Oh, my gosh.
They're awesome.
What's the
great news?
I challenged the varsity girls
team to a scrimmage.
What?
It's going to be...
it's going to be great.
You have a chance to play
in a real game
at night with a scoreboard
and a gym full of fans.
Miss Vessey, I think you're
glossing over a basic fact here
which is that the varsity girls,
they're going to kick our...
Where's your pride?
Do you know
what their coach said to me?
He said we probably wouldn't
even hit double digits.
We probably won't
hit double digits.
Listen...
We're going
to play this game.
Because it's not about the game.
It's about<i> not</i>
getting pushed around
anymore.
It's about not being treated
like losers.
Because you're
not losers.
It's about going out there
and showing the world
that you are not losers
on the court and off.
And win or lose, Friday night
that is just
what we're going to do.
Did you just
make that up?
Yes.
Yes, I did.
It was pretty good.
ED:
<i> Mr. Schmidt, you testified</i>
that this prank
ruined your life.
Yes, it did.
I was happy, I had a solid job,
wife...
Now, I have nothing.
Help me with
something.
Your attorney,
Mr. Murphy
he keeps claiming
that my client
should have
reasonably expected
that winning
the lottery
caused you to quit your job,
leave your wife...
you're always grumbling about
how miserable your life was...
I'm confused.
Which was it,
Mr. Schmidt?
Were you happy
with your life
or were you unhappy?
You don't have to look
to your attorney.
Your Honor, I would like
to submit in evidence
Mr. Schmidt's last five
employee performance reports.
Your last one
states, in part
"Ted is habitually late
"and calls in sick more
than any other employee
"in the department.
"His attitude is terrible,
and, as a result
his overall job performance
leaves much to be desired."
That doesn't sound like a
happy guy who loves his job.
Hey, it was just a job.
Yes, Mr. Schmidt...
it's just a job.
Mr. Schmidt's
financial records
for the past several
years, Your Honor
in which I notice
that you've written
several checks
to Dr. Rachel Garner
over the last year
and a half.
What kind of
doctor is she?
She's a psychologist.
Specializing in?
-Marriage counseling.
So, happy marriage...
Hey, we're working on it.
You're working on it,
except I have here
your personal
American Express bill
which shows several charges
to the Stadium Motor Lodge
which happens to be less than
five miles from your house.
Ted, were you going
there with your wife?
Objection. -Overruled.
Answer the question,
Mr. Schmidt.
No, I was seeing someone.
I'm very sorry
your perfect life was ruined.
Objection.
Withdrawn.
Ah... Mom, Dad.
What are you guys doing here?
Was the flight canceled?
Come inside, Ed.
Is... everything okay?
Follow me
to the living room.
Hello.
Hi, Ed, sit down and
make yourself comfortable.
George, right?
It's been a while, huh?
You know, you look more
and more like your pop.
Thanks... I guess.
Would you like some coffee
or a menthol cigarette?
No, thanks.
Phil...
what-what are
you doing here?
Sir... do I know you?
Oh, this is Godfrey.
He's my sponsor.
No, thanks.
Someone like to
tell me what's...
what's going on?
Ed...
life is like a footpath
through a dark
African jungle.
As long as you stick
to the path, you're okay.
But it's very tempting
to wonder or stray.
Look over there.
Colorful bird.
Over there... a
fragrant plant life.
When I was your age
I walked off my path.
You name it,
I did it.
Booze, gambling, smank.
But I lived to tell the story
thanks to friends
and family
like we have here.
We love you, Ed.
What is this?
An intervention.
KENNY:
We have to chase these kids.
Don't worry.
I'm a big man,
but I'm also quick.
I once caught a live chicken
with my bare hands
like Rocky Balboa.
I've got a question.
Yeah.
If you took a hamburger,
and put it in a blender
and blended it up so it
became like a hamburger sauce
and then you took that hamburger
sauce and put it onto another hamburger
would that hamburger then have
double the hamburger flavor
of a regular hamburger?
No. It would be just like
eating two hamburgers.
But it's not
two hamburgers.
It's one hamburger with
hamburger sauce on top.
You should send that in
to<i> Readers Digest.</i>
You might be fooling the rest of
them, but you're not fooling me.
People like us
we're the best liars
in the world
'cause we get so much
practice lying to ourselves.
You're having
a nervous breakdown!
If you're going to ride,
don't ride the white horse.
All right, enough! Enough! What is
with you people? Just leave me alone.
There's nothing wrong with me. Dad!
Oh, look, um, I'd like to have
a private talk with my son.
Would you mind
going into the kitchen
and have some cold cuts?
Look, Ed, I'm sorry.
Maybe I...
maybe I took things
a little too far.
Yeah, I would say so.
Sometimes I go overboard
when I'm trying
to make a point.
If your point is you're
disappointed and unhappy
with the way I'm living my life
trust me,
your point's been made.
I just didn't want
to see you
make the same mistake
that I made.
Dad...
When you were about
five years old
I was a junior manager
at the drapery plant.
One day I got a call...
I know the story, Dad.
I know the story.
They said they wanted
to make you a vice president
and move you down to Dallas
and Mom hated it there
so you turned it down
and stayed in Stuckeyville. I...
No, no, no, no.
That's not quit true, Ed.
Your mother was fine
about Dallas.
I turned it down,
because I was afraid.
Afraid to go down there
and get the crap
kicked out of me
and come hauling back
to Stuckeyville.
The best opportunity
of my career
and I let it go.
Now, I look at you
and I see a guy
who's been thrown off a horse
and is too scared
to get back up.
But if you don't
you'll never know
what you could have achieved.
to play a prank
and stole the stop sign
from the intersection
of Main and Maple?
Whoops!
Somebody gets killed.
Sorry. Just a prank.
Would I be held responsible?
Of course, I would.
In our society people are
responsible for their actions.
Your Honor, this prank
ruined this man's life.
I ask that you hold
these men responsible
for their actions.
Thank you.
ED: Your Honor, two
important points:
One: yes, stealing stop signs
could make one reasonably expect
that there will be a crash
but my clients could
never reasonably expect
Ted Schmidt would alter his life
so dramatically
which brings me to point two.
If I may, let me tell you
a little bit about myself.
I sympathize with Ted
Schmidt. I really do.
I used to be a lot like him. I
was just cruising through life.
I had a wife, a job in a
prestigious New York City law firm
and then one day I was
fired and I came home
and I found my wife
sleeping with the mailman.
That was no prank. Let
me tell you something.
For some people,
no matter how it comes about
having their life changed
may be the best thing
that ever happens to them.
Ted Schmidt is seeking damages.
Well, there are no damages because
Ted Schmidt is much better off now
than he ever was
before. He hated his job.
His marriage was in shambles
and these are the reasons
that he decided to change his
life. The lottery ticket...
the lottery ticket just gave him
the courage to do so.
Thank you.
Everybody's going to the
basketball game tonight.
The kids who
steal the "T"
will probably
be there, too.
If the kids are at the game,
then we could go to the game
without putting
the "T" in jeopardy.
We can fasten it down
extra tight just in case.
Let's get the tools.
I feel like
this experience
has brought us closer together.
I disagree.
Supposing I accept
Mr. Stevens' claim
that Ted Schmidt is better
off now than he was before.
Can I then conclude that
there are no damages? -No.
However, damages or no damages
I'm convinced
that the defendants
could not have
reasonably expected
Mr. Schmidt's reaction
to their prank.
I therefore find
for the defendants
Frank Zelter and Dave Gersky.
Thanks, Ed.
-You're welcome, Frank.
Congratulations, honey. -Thank
you. -That was pretty good.
Thanks, Dad.
(<i> crowd cheering</i> )
Looks like your girls
forgot to show up.
Oh, they're coming, Bob.
ED: (<i> echoing</i> ): Ladies and gentlemen,
please put your hands together
for the women's J. V. basketball
team your Stuckeyville Toreadors!
(<i> cheering</i> )
(<i> whistle blowing</i> )
(<i> cheering</i> )
Way to go! Way to go!
This baby's not going anywhere now.
-Where'd you learn how to do that?
In the joint. Come on.
The game's already started.
Let's go.
Oh...
That's a foul! That's a foul!
Time-out! Time-out!
Time-out! Time-out!
-Wait, wait.
What are you doing calling a
time-out with six seconds left?
We are ahead by 60
points. What's the point?
The point is we have the ball
there are six seconds on the clock
and we are going to
score double digits
and there's not a damn thing you
can do about it. -Is that right?
Well, we'll see about
that. Starters, in.
We're not going to let them
score. -Come on, girls! Come on in.
Come on in for the huddle. Come on,
girls, huddle around. Come on in.
Okay, this is what
we're going to do.
All right, Kate, Diane,
Cara, the three of you
pull off to one side.
It's going to be
Jenny and Susan.
You know what to do.
Pick-and-roll?
Pick-and-roll, right.
Wouldn't this
be a good time
for another one
of those speeches?
I believe in you guys. -That's it?
Win one for the Gipper.
That's good. -Okay. All right.
Go... team!
All right, get out there!
Let's see it!
Let's see it!

That was the greatest
58-point loss
in the history of sport.
Mm. Look at 'em.
Wow.
Woo-hoo! Ten points! Ten points!
All:
Whoo! Whoo!
One-zero spells
double team points.
That's right. That's
right, Kenny. Hey, Ma.
There he is. -Hey,
Dad, you got a minute?
Sure. -I'll go inside.
Come on. -That was quite
a job on the microphone.
I never knew you had such a
powerful voice. -Thanks, thanks.
Look, Dad, I want
to say thank you
for coming down here
to help me.
Well, I'm not sure
we succeeded.
Dad, remember how you said
you were afraid
of taking the risk
of going down to Dallas?
Yeah. -Well, for me
taking the risk was coming back
down here and doing all of this.
Staying in New York
with the big job
that would have been
the safe road.
Couldn't you at least
build a separate entrance
for the law practice
so it's not literally
right inside the
bowling alley? -No, Dad
I really can't.
But, hey, look
on the bright side
you know, for the rest
of your life
you're going to get to bowl
for free. (<i> both laugh</i> )
That's something.
-That's something.
Shoes you'll have to
pay for. -Yeah, well...
I'm kidding.
I'm kidding!
