- Father O'Malley.
- Yes.
Welcome to St. Mary's.
Thank you.
I suppose
you're tired after traveling.
It's pretty tiresome,
all the way in the day coach.
Your room's all ready.
There's nothing to do now
but go to bed.
Is Father Fogarty still here?
No. They took him away
this morning.
Poor man.
My heart went out to him.
Poor man? Why?
You'll find out.
I think you'll find everything
you want here.
Couldn't I get you a cup of tea?
No, thanks.
I don't understand what you mean
about Father Fogarty.
I'll find out what?
What Father Fogarty found out.
The poor man.
There you go again.
What happened to him?
They took him away mumbling
to himself in a wheelchair.
They took him away?
Where?
Shady Rest.
He even said a prayer for you...
that your stay here might be
successful and enjoyable...
though he doubted it.
He had very definite ideas
about running this school...
about the education of children,
and so have they.
They?
The sisters.
Father Fogarty said they wanted
their way in everything...
and after he was confined
to a wheelchair, they had it.
Maybe he was just
getting along in years.
No.
He looked all right
when he got here.
That's strange.
I don't anticipate any trouble.
You don't?
You've never been pastor
of a parochial school, then.
It's my first experience.
Oh.
Well... I see you don't know
what it means...
to be up to your neck in nuns.
No.
Good night.
Good night.
Sleep well tonight.
Good morning, Sister.
I'm Father O'Malley.
Good morning.
This is our school bell.
We usually ring it an hour from
now when the children are here.
Could I see Sister Superior?
Is she up?
I'm sure she is.
- Will you come with me?
- Yes.
Good morning, Sam.
Good morning.
Sam.
Sister Benedict
and the others...
are eager to meet you.
I'll tell her you're here.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
Our cat had kittens,
and they're all over.
The father's a member
of the parish, I presume.
Excuse me.
I'll tell Sister you're here.
Good morning.
Won't you sit?
Good morning.
Would you sit?
Good morning.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Good morning.
This has been my...
This is Sister Superior.
Father O'Malley,
Sister Mary Benedict.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Sisters,
this is Father O'Malley.
How do you do?
He's a substitute
for Father Fogarty...
who has departed
for a much needed rest.
We hope your stay
will be pleasant.
Thank you.
We look forward expectantly
to your views as an educator.
I'm sure Father
wishes to say a few words.
Yes, I...
St. Mary's
has been here many years...
and has seen the labors
of many sisters of your order.
I know the work
hasn't been easy.
In the eyes of the world,
very few take notice...
but earthly honors and rewards
are not for you.
You've sent forth
generations of pupils...
who have been a credit to
the teachings inculcated here.
St. Mary's
has grown old doing good.
As for myself...
I'm happy I've been selected
as pastor of St. Mary's.
Working in a parish
where there's a parish school...
is going to prove
a new experience for me...
and I'm sure
a very interesting one.
I see what you mean.
However, as in all things...
we assume our assigned task
without complaint...
and with a hopeful view
to the future.
Yes.
By the epistle of St. Peter,
where he says...
"Be sober and watch."
Was it St. Paul?
Just to get serious
for a moment, it...
In conclusion,
may I say that I'm happy...
I'm sorry,
but that's the first bell...
and the sisters have to go
to their classes.
Care to talk to the pupils
before the second bell?
You may prefer speaking
to the children.
I'd certainly be more at ease.
I want to speak to you, too.
I pledge allegiance
to the flag...
of the United States
of America...
and to the republic
for which it stands...
one nation, indivisible...
with liberty and justice
for all.
Children.
Our new pastor, Father O'Malley,
wishes to speak to you.
I'm sure you'll be
glad to greet him...
and I'm sure he has something
important to say.
Children, you'll see
a lot of me in the future.
I'm going to be here
a great deal.
Here's the shortest speech
you ever heard...
This is a holiday.
Take the day off.
Yay!
Pretty effective speech, huh?
I had to get
my self-confidence back.
When we were kids,
we lived for holidays.
We shouldn't get far away
from our childhood.
Do you realize what you've done?
They're liable
to get into mischief.
The responsibility is yours.
It seemed like a good idea.
You can't call a holiday
just like that.
You have to get permission of
the superintendent of schools.
What will we tell him?
I'll call him.
He really needs a holiday.
I may give him the day off.
My school wasn't like this.
I could look out the window...
and see fields, trees,
the old swimming hole.
Hang your clothes on the tree.
Last out finds them
tied in knots.
- Where?
- Missouri.
I came from Ireland.
I used to.
Where you from?
I was born in Sweden,
but when I was small...
Don't tell me. Minnesota.
That's right.
I love the winter.
I used to ski to school,
and there was one big hill.
Oh.
You carry them home after.
She was a tomboy
from what I hear.
That so?
She played baseball
and football with the boys.
How good were you at...
I hit over.300.
That's in the wheat belt.
We had it better
than these kids.
They haven't even got
a place to play.
That used to be our playground.
Over there?
Yes. We sold the ground.
We needed money
to fix our building.
They were going to condemn it.
Where'd you put the money?
You'd be surprised.
We installed a new
sprinkler system, fire escapes.
The foundation
had to be reinforced.
Hardly seems worth it.
We think so.
Yes. Of course.
What are the other classrooms
like?
What's going on up there?
Roof repair. It leaks.
A trifle.
You're overcrowded,
aren't you?
Yes.
A trifle.
Looks like St. Mary's
is in a bad way... a trifle.
We're relying on you
to help us.
Too bad you don't have
a building like that.
That would be your answer
to everything.
That's where
we intended our new St. Mary's.
A building very much like that.
There it is,
only we don't own it.
Confidentially, that's what
we've been praying for.
For what?
That the owner
will wake up one morning...
and give it to us.
That who would wake up
when and give you what?
Mr. Bogardus, the owner.
That's what we're praying for.
Oh, woman, great is thy faith.
If faith can move mountains...
You figured
you could move right in?
Yes.
You've got to be practical.
Anybody ask the owner
about this?
No, we just prayed.
That's where you could help us.
What do I do when he says no?
All you kids!
Get out of there!
Why aren't you in school?
You hear me?
They shouldn't be doing that.
After all, it's a holiday.
Who's this?
That's Mr. Bogardus.
We better go now.
Tell him why the children
aren't in school.
Want me to say anything
about the building?
Some other time.
Hey, you, here.
What's going on here?
- You see that fence?
- Yeah.
See what those children are...
Who are you?
I'm the new pastor.
See to it that those brats
are punished.
I'll handle it, Mr. Bogardus.
I will censure them severely.
You know who I am?
Yes, I do.
You the fella
I'm to do business with?
I'm here to make
some recommendations.
I've been looking over
the school.
You have?
What do you think of it?
Looks pretty tired.
Tired is no name for it.
If you don't sell...
You got my offer, right?
- Right here.
- What do you say?
It's a difficult decision.
I can't jump at it.
If you don't sell to me,
it's going to be condemned.
By whom?
The City Council.
How do you know?
I'm chairman.
You are?
You're darned right.
When they order you
to tear it down...
you've got to pay for it.
You look like a practical man.
I do?
There's not a mother or father
in the parish...
that wouldn't rather see their
children over at St. Victor's.
Fine modern building.
Everything up to date.
Sunlight,
good heat in the winter.
I'd never send my children
into that firetrap.
You have any children?
No.
- That's a long story.
- Skip it.
All right.
How far do the children have
to go to get to St. Victor's?
As far as I had to go
as a child.
Let's walk over.
Why not take my car?
Can't walk too much.
I've got a bad ticker.
Let's ride out to St. Victor's.
Now you're talking.
Just close this school...
and send the children
to St. Victor's.
Sell the property to you?
That's right. It's that simple.
You can always find me.
I'm here every day.
I won't do anything
without talking to you.
I'm a slow thinker, though.
You don't look it. No, sir.
Good-bye.
Father?
How do you do?
Are you in charge
of the school here?
That's a question.
I have some authority.
You look like a man who could
understand my language.
Let's find out.
Start talking.
I'd like very much to put
my daughter in school here.
Mm-hmm.
You see, uh...
I think it would be better...
if she was away from me
for a while.
Could she board?
It might be arranged,
but why did you...
Does she need any references?
Do you have to know very much
about her background?
Yes. That is customary.
Well, um...
it's like this.
I ran away from home
when I was young to get married.
Stop me if you've heard this.
He left me a long time ago
in Syracuse.
Thirteen years, to be exact.
Did you get married?
Yes, after a little argument.
I think he was afraid
of settling down.
- He was a piano player.
- Oh.
He had a wonderful smile.
I'll bet.
Very like yours.
He had a little band...
kind of
a nonrecording orchestra.
Did you ever hear
of Gallagher's Gambleers?
No. Did anyone else?
I doubt it.
Anyway, the little band got
an offer to play in Cincinnati.
He promised once he got money,
he'd send for me.
You were left alone in Syracuse?
Till the baby came.
You've been supporting her
all this time?
Mm-hmm.
I suppose you're wondering
as to how.
So is she.
She's getting to be
a big girl now.
She's beginning to think
I'm no good.
I want to put her
in your care...
before she finds out
she's right.
Anyone as concerned
about their daughter as you...
isn't doing too badly.
If there was anything
really wrong, you wouldn't care.
Joe was the only man I was ever
really in love with, but...
If you care so much,
why didn't you look him up?
I wouldn't know where to start.
Besides...
he ran out on me.
Oh, that's it.
I'll do the best I can for you.
What's your daughter's name?
Patricia.
Patricia.
I'll make a deal with you.
I'll take care of your daughter,
if you'll take care of yourself.
Thank you. Father...
- O'Malley.
- O'Malley.
Good-bye, Mrs. Gallagher.
Good-bye.
A young lady's
calling to see you.
Send her in.
- Miss Gallagher?
- Yes.
You'll board across
the street with Mrs. Breen.
That will be just lovely.
My boy will take your bags.
Eddie, take those bags
to the back bedroom.
OK, Mom.
Well, Patricia...
The sisters were expecting
someone younger, and so was I.
I was trying to look older.
I've been looking for work.
I thought I'd quit school
and take a job.
I was up early answering ads.
I'm perfectly able
to take care of myself.
Patsy, you'll be very happy here
at St. Mary's.
You'll enjoy every minute of it.
You'll find that life can be
very bright, beautiful here.
The character came off.
Let me look at you.
That's fine.
Give us a chance,
and we'll fix you up.
What do we got here?
What are you smuggling?
What is this here?
It's a rat.
Around here, you can't wear
even a small mouse.
Things are brightening up
already, aren't they?
Oh, goodness.
Holy Toledo. Look at that.
You sent for me?
Yes, Patricia.
I wanted to talk to you.
You're falling behind
in your studies.
If the work is too hard,
I'll be glad to help.
That isn't it.
I guess I'm just a featherhead.
Don't you like school?
You're holding back on me.
What's troubling you?
Nothing.
If you'll only
work a little harder...
you'll get good marks.
We want to send your mother
a nice report card.
You want your mother
to be proud of you, right?
That's all.
You may go.
Thank you.
Hi, Pat.
Hi.
How's she doing?
Not very well.
No?
I'm sorry to hear that.
We accepted this child
on your recommendation.
We know little
about her parents.
What kind of home life
did she have?
The usual.
- You met her mother?
- I have.
Do you know Mrs. Gallagher well?
Yes, I know her quite well.
Did you meet her father?
I've heard about him.
What is his occupation?
He's a... musician.
They tell me he has
a charming personality, too.
I like people who like music,
don't you?
Are they separated?
Yes.
Is there anything I should know
that would help?
No, that's all that I...
Care to tell?
Yes.
Did anyone ever tell you
you have a dishonest face?
For a priest, I mean.
Break it up.
I'll knock
your two heads together.
The winner!
You're pretty shifty,
aren't you?
Let's see you operate.
Can't hit you.
Look at your shoe.
You got to keep watching.
Eddie, come over here.
Go inside and wash your face.
Why didn't you fight back?
You're pretty handy.
What's your name?
Tommy Smith.
Keep your head up.
He's all right.
You better speak to Tommy.
He's new, and I'm afraid
he's a troublemaker.
He's a good fighter, though.
We don't tolerate fighting here.
If he continues to pick fights,
we may have to send him away.
Aren't we supposed
to be educators?
Instead of sending him away,
let's correct him.
I observed little correction
in your attitude.
Actually, I detected
a slight note of pride.
Naturally, I like to see a lad
who takes care of himself.
On the outside,
it's a man's world.
How are they doing?
Not too good.
You know what I mean.
Sometimes a man
has to fight his way through.
Wouldn't it be better to...
to think your way through?
That's pure conjecture,
of course...
from someone on the inside.
That's very well put, though.
Don't you think sometimes
in raising boys...
a woman's influence
can be carried too far?
You mean
they may become sissies?
That's right.
You look after Tommy,
and I'll look after Eddie...
who lost the fight
because he listened to me.
Eddie?
Yes?
Come here. We'll fix you.
Let me look at that.
How did this happen?
I was minding my own business
when Tommy trips me.
Although I was very mad,
I controlled myself...
like you said.
I said to him,
"Why'd you do that?"
What did he say?
He didn't say anything.
He just hit me here.
Fine thing.
Then what did you do?
I remembered what you said...
I turned the other cheek.
Then he really let me have it.
You're a very good boy.
I turned away to ignore him,
and he kicked me!
I'm very proud of you.
I don't feel so hot.
But you really won
a victory over Tommy.
Did I?
Yes.
You were really the better man.
You and I know that.
Nobody else knows it.
To tell you the truth,
I don't know it.
Nobody was proud of me.
Even Father O'Malley.
Don't you think he thought Tommy
was the best man?
The better man.
I was thinking.
Since I've taken such a beating,
and I've been through so much...
maybe I wouldn't have
to go to school today.
Maybe.
But if you think I should go...
I'll go no matter
how bad I feel.
Maybe I'll declare
a holiday just for you.
Thanks.
Are you interested in baseball?
Oh, yes, yes.
Tell me,
have you any textbooks...
on the manly art
of self-defense?
I beg your pardon?
Oh, she means pugilistics.
I mean boxing.
Boxing?
Yes, yes, of course.
They're right over here.
Now, here's a book
endorsed by James J. Corbett.
He won 10 straight fights.
Nobody could lay a glove
on him...
till Fitzsimmons
knocked him out.
Did Mr. Fitzsimmons
write a book?
Did Mr. Fitzsimmons
write a book?
No.
Oh, there's
a very scholarly book here...
by Mr. Tunney.
Oh, well, we'll take that.
That'll be $1.00.
Thank you. Thank...
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, Father.
- Good afternoon, Sister.
Move this so we have more room.
That's fine.
It's nice of you
to come on a Saturday.
It's worth it, Sister.
I read this whole book
last night. It's perfect.
Your homework, Sister?
Yeah.
Now, the four
most valuable punches...
it says here...
are... now let me show you...
the straight left...
a right cross...
a left hook...
and a right uppercut.
See? Now let me see
how you stand.
Well...
Like that?
How do you fight?
Well, uh...
like that.
Oh, no, no.
It's nothing like it.
We'll start from the beginning.
Now put this foot back a bit.
Back. That's it.
See how I stand? Like this.
And bend your knees
a little bit. Bend them.
Uh, no, your toe
should be in here.
That's right.
And your hands up like that.
Yes, that looks pretty good.
Your head should be down.
That's right.
Now, that's fine.
Now just like that.
Let me see now,
what do we do next?
Yes. We start to move around.
We move around a little bit.
And keep...
uh, keep shooting your left.
That's right.
Right. Uh-huh.
That's good.
Now, Eddie,
keep your chin down like this...
and get your shoulder up.
Well, I can't do it so well
in this collar.
You know what I mean?
You protect your chin that way.
And another thing,
you have to be weaving.
Weaving, that's right.
And bobbing.
A moving target is much harder
to hit. Remember that.
For instance, if I try
to hit you on this cheek...
you move to the other side.
You weave.
I'm sorry. Sorry.
You should be weaving,
you see what I mean?
See, like that. And now...
Got that? That's right.
Now faster.
Gosh, that's better
than turning the other cheek.
Much more fun if they miss,
don't you think?
Well, I'll admit...
it's easier on your face.
You said it, Sister.
Well, now, where were we?
Let me see.
Although they say this is
the most valuable punch of all...
the left jab...
it seems this is the payoff.
Now we'll try both hands.
The one...
Eddie, keep your mouth closed.
That's very important.
Keep your mouth closed.
The man devoted
two whole pages to that.
He meant if you don't,
you'll be sorry.
Now keep your mouth closed,
real tight.
Now we'll use both hands.
Now, if I try to hit you here...
you block it with this hand.
That's right,
and block it there...
and then again.
That's right. That's right.
But be careful.
Look out for the payoff.
There are lots of things
to remember...
lefts and rights
and bobbing and weaving.
Let's try them all.
Move around.
Come on. Here we go.
Look me right in the eye.
See if you can anticipate
my blows.
Look out now. Look out.
Ohh. That was very, very good.
That's splendid, Eddie.
Yes. You learn fast.
That's right.
Now let's go again. Come on.
Move around.
You're so clumsy.
You have to be on your toes.
Move around quickly, you know?
Oh, that's my fault.
I forgot to mention footwork.
It says that footwork
is almost a lost art.
It's very important.
We have to learn it.
It's lots of fun.
You'll like it.
See?
Sometimes it gets very fancy.
Yes, it's...
Well, maybe that's too much
for the first lesson.
Yes. I think we'll wait.
We have enough to think about.
Just try now to...
You try to hit me.
That's right.
Come on. Come on.
Uh-huh. That's right.
And then a little... No.
See? You just can't hit me,
can you?
Go ahead, Eddie.
But I don't wanna hit you.
Oh, don't worry.
Come on now. I won't be there.
Ah, you see what I mean?
You just can't...
Ohh!
I'm sorry, Sister.
Oh, that's all right.
That's enough
for the first lesson, though.
You forgot your footwork.
You forgot something,
didn't you?
Something?
I forgot everything.
I forgot to bob,
I forgot to weave.
I had my mouth open.
And I ran right into the payoff!
Ohh.
Good evening, Father.
Patsy's right in here.
Good.
- Hello, Father.
- Eddie.
Will you stop that
and get off to bed?
Stay up. You'll get a draw.
I don't know
what's wrong with him lately.
I think he's been out
in the sun too much.
Not during school hours, I hope.
Good evening, Patsy.
- Good evening, Father.
- Sit down.
You're up a little late,
aren't you?
What's the matter?
You in trouble?
Father, shouldn't I quit school
and take a job?
What can you do?
You have to know something
to do anything, you know.
You shouldn't get discouraged,
Patsy.
I've been watching your marks,
and they're all right.
They're getting better.
Oh, Father,
you're just being nice.
Every time
I think I know one thing...
then they ask me something else.
I'm just a perfect blank.
Guess I haven't got
what it takes.
Now don't ever think
you're dumb.
All right, Father...
let's just say
I'm not very bright.
Hmm.
What's the problem tonight?
Why are you up so late?
It's an essay, Father.
"The Five Senses."
That's an interesting subject.
What have you discovered
about them?
Nothing. See what I mean?
What are the five senses, Patsy?
Well, to see, to hear,
to taste, to smell...
to feel.
That's right.
Who's the essay for?
Sister Benedict.
Oh, we'll have to take dead aim
on this one...
see if we can get you an "A."
But you don't wanna be
like your classmates.
They'll all come up with
the same stereotyped answers.
We want to be different,
be unique.
We'll write Sister an essay
on another sense, huh?
Let's see.
Man is endowed with...
certain powers
which we call the five senses.
Now, if he has common sense...
he'll get great happiness
out of life...
by using these powers
within right reason.
For instance, you're happy
you came to St. Mary's, right?
Yes, Father.
To be...
to be glad you're alive...
to be grateful because
people are kind to you...
to be able to see
some of nature's great wonders...
the budding
of the flowers in spring...
the changing of leaves
in the autumn...
to be able to appreciate
beautiful music...
to be conscious of the beauty
of tasting and feeling...
and hearing only the things
that are good for you.
To be aware of why you're here.
Oh, I could go on
and on and on, but...
Well, why don't you, Father?
Hmmph. I think I will.
Every time you're near a rose...
aren't you glad
you've got a nose?
And if the dawn
is fresh with dew...
aren't you glad you're you?
When a meadowlark appears...
aren't you glad
you've got two ears?
And if your heart
is singing, too...
aren't you glad you're you?
You can see a summer sky...
or touch a friendly hand...
or taste an apple pie.
Pardon the grammar,
but ain't life grand?
And when you wake up
each morn...
aren't you glad
that you were born?
Think what you've got
the whole day through.
Aren't you glad you're you?
Patsy, I'll leave you
with those few little thoughts.
What do you make of them?
Well, if you can't appreciate
your five senses...
then your life
isn't worth five cents.
That's good, good.
Hope you do well tomorrow.
Thank you, Father.
I feel much better.
I feel pretty good myself.
Now, children!
Seems I can't leave you
for a minute.
"Dear class, it's a holiday."
Now, who did this?
I must ask you again.
Who did this?
Now, children,
I'm putting you on your honor.
Who did this?
It's your duty to tell me.
Good morning.
We're honored
with your visit, Father.
Be seated, children.
Won't you take my chair?
We'll take this matter up later.
Now we'll continue.
Read what you've written,
so Father O'Malley may hear it.
Luther.
Luther? How'd he get in here?
We never knew.
"The Five Senses.
"I like to see a good movie...
"with Roy Rogers."
"I like the taste
of ice-cream cones...
"especially strawberry.
"I like to listen
to the Lone Ranger.
"Heigh-ho, Silver!
"I like the smell of hot dogs
at the ball park.
"I like to feel good."
Don't laugh, children.
Luther means he wants
to be a good boy.
You want to feel good in here,
don't you, Luther?
No, Sister.
I meant to feel good...
is like when the bell rings
at 3:00...
or when it's Easter vacation,
better still.
That's how I meant to feel good.
Well, it has both
honesty and imagination.
You can sit down.
And now, um, Patricia.
"The Six Senses."
The subject I gave
was the five senses.
Well, I chose for my subject
six senses.
Well, go on, Patricia, go on.
"The six senses...
to see, to hear, to taste...
"to smell, to feel...
"to be.
"And the most important
is the last.
"The sixth sense...
"is to be able to enjoy
the five senses properly."
"To be...
that's what really matters.
"It's a like world inside us,
and we make what we may of it."
"We see others,
we hear others...
"we know others
with our five senses...
"but how do we ever know
ourselves?
"Through common sense.
"Common sense
is an internal sense...
"whose function it is
to differentiate...
"between the various reports
of the senses...
"or to reduce these reports...
"to the unity
of a common perception."
Two great words..."To be."
Other words grow out
of them...
I am, you are, he is,
we are, they are.
That sort of takes in everybody.
As Shakespeare said...
"To thine own self be true...
"and it shall follow,
as the night the day...
"thou canst not then be false
to any man."
And he was so right, Sister.
Oh, yes.
He was just talking
about the sixth sense.
To put it in my own words...
"To be or not to be,
that is the question."
Very good, Patricia.
Very good.
And one more thing, Sister...
Saved by the bell.
In the name of the Father...
and of the son
and of the holy ghost, amen.
You may go now, children.
I really learned something.
Oh?
She shows a lot of promise.
Oh, definitely.
You giving her a "B," perhaps?
Oh, no. I think an "A."
Good. That's fine.
As a matter of fact,
it should be maybe
an "A"-plus, don't you, Father?
That might be overdoing it
a little.
It had a plus quality to it.
Yeah. A girl like Patsy needs
a lot of encouragement.
She has such a fine mind.
Yes. Remarkable.
In fact, she has the mentality
of a man your age.
There's another sense,
you know, Sister?
Oh, don't tell me.
Yeah. Sense enough
to know when to leave.
Good morning, Sister.
Little Bobby wants
to play with you.
Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!
Yay!
I'm sorry
I had to do that to you...
but if you're a good sport,
we'll shake and be friends.
I'll even buy you
an ice-cream cone.
- Two scoops?
- Two scoops!
Eddie,
how did you learn to fight?
Yeah, how about that?
Sister.
You missed some excitement here.
I did?
Yes, you did, uh...
Yes, you did. Ahem.
It was quite a fight.
That little Eddie there...
That is Eddie, isn't it?
Oh, yes. Yes, that's Eddie.
The boy in that fight
a while ago?
Mm-hmm. Yes.
Quite a change.
It's incredible.
He's an improved man.
I wonder.
Does it mean anything, Father?
Does it prove anything
to beat up your fellow man?
Somehow, don't you think...
it's what we are in here
that matters?
I mean...
I mean, to be.
You're so right. Ahem.
But how do you account
for such a sudden change...
in such a short time?
Oh, we try to do our best
to raise masculine little men...
with our limited knowledge
of the outside world.
Yes, Sister?
I'm sorry, Father,
but you're disturbing us.
Disturbing who?
We're rehearsing a play and
the children can't concentrate.
They're first graders,
easily distracted.
We're making too much noise?
To use your own words,
yes, Father.
We heard about your play...
and we've prepared
a little surprise for you.
You can't have a Christmas play
without Adeste Fideles.
Oh, yes.
You mean there's no room
in your play...
Not in our play.
What? I'd certainly like
to see a play like that.
Would you like to see
a rehearsal?
Yes. You kids stay here
and practice awhile.
What are you going to use
for music?
Come and find out.
Bobby! Bobby!
Well, here's the little man
I was telling you about.
Bobby's an old pal of mine.
You in the play, Bob?
Yes. I made it up.
I bet you've got a good part.
Yes. It's beautiful.
Can we see the play now, Bobby?
It's a little bit not good.
We're just practicing it.
It'll be better at Christmas.
We won't mind a few mistakes.
No. What's it about?
That's what I tell you
at the beginning.
Why don't we begin?
You ready?
The children have
done this all by themselves.
Every time the dialogue
is different.
Every line is a surprise to me.
Heaven knows what it's going
to be at Christmas.
Performing
before their parents...
they'll probably
forget everything.
This is Mary, and I'm Joseph...
and we're going to Bethlehem...
to see if we can have
someplace...
find someplace to stay.
And that's all you have to know,
really.
- Knock knock.
- Hello?
This is Mary, and I'm Joseph.
We came to Bethlehem
to find a place to stay.
Do you have any money?
No, sir.
Then you can't
stay here tonight.
Well, that's too bad for us.
Mary, we can't stay there...
because we don't have
any money.
I'll be all right
as long as I'm with you.
Well, I think
we ought to find a house...
because it might rain soon.
It's winter, you know.
Well, why don't you
try next door?
Good idea.
Knock knock knock knock.
Can't stay here because
you don't have any money.
I didn't ask yet.
Go back inside again.
Knock knock knock.
- Hello there.
- Hello.
This is Mary, and I'm Joseph...
and could we... could we...
stay here for the night?
Please?
Do you have any money?
No, but Mary's awfully tired.
Could you think it over?
OK.
What did he say, Joseph?
He said he'd think it over.
Well, when will he know?
I don't know.
Hey, Joseph, I thought it over.
You can stay in the stable.
Golly gee, did you hear that?
Yes, Joseph.
Uh...
the next scene will be
the Lord Jesus' birthday.
You're supposed to lift it.
No, no, Jimmy. Go back.
Go on back.
You're in the play.
His baby brother.
Well, here we all are
in the stables...
and we're very happy here
in Bethlehem...
and there's our star.
Here's our angel...
there are the shepherds...
and here are the wise men...
there, there, and there.
And, oh... the neighbors
are coming in...
bringing their presents
because it's his birthday.
Thank you.
You make Mary and I very happy.
Now what, Bobby?
You sing Holy Night, perhaps?
No, Father.
We have another song.
Oh? How's it go?
Happy birthday to you...
Happy birthday to you...
Happy birthday, dear Jesus...
Happy birthday to you.
Well, Father?
Oh, their simplicity
is beautiful.
I wouldn't change a word of it.
But they will.
You won't be needing
my talents at Christmas.
No, Father.
Maybe at Easter time
I could stage an egg hunt.
Mm-hmm.
Look, Sister.
There's Father O'Malley.
I hope he finds him
in a favorable mood.
He could be.
It's spring, you know.
We're not
getting anywhere, Father.
It's a difficult
decision, Mr. Bogardus...
to decide that there'll be
no more St. Mary's.
If you ask me,
it's not much now.
It is to the sisters.
To you, that school
is just a piece of property...
but to them,
well, it's everything.
It's not just selling you
the property...
it's the thought
of selling them out.
You're getting
sentimental, aren't you?
I've been here long
enough to know how they feel.
What about when it's condemned?
They're expecting a miracle.
A miracle?
What miracle will get them
out of trouble?
You'd be surprised.
Oh! Oh, gee!
No, Delphine,
you're not doing it right.
Show me, Sister.
You don't hold it right.
This is the way
you should hold it.
And straight.
You chop it.
Don't chop like that.
Keep your hands together
and step into it.
You see?
Hit one, Sister.
Throw it.
I don't think so.
You better do it.
Yay! Yay!
Oh! Aah!
Doggone those kids!
There they go again!
Here's your chance.
They're coming to apologize.
Ask them
if they're willing to sell.
If it's all right with them...
it's all right with you?
I'll recommend it.
'Course, you'll have
to see the bishop.
He has the final word.
How's his business sense?
You'll be glad to come
to me... and you'll have to.
I'll give you the letter
to see the bishop...
but only after you've
straightened yourself out...
with the sisters.
Good luck.
Oh, I'll never get
this deal closed.
Is he very angry?
I think you'll find him
quite forgiving.
You mean, for giving?
Would it be
a good time to ask him, Father?
Never be any better.
We are so sorry, Mr. Bogardus.
It's nothing, Sister.
It's perfectly all right.
- We'll pay for it.
- Don't think of it, Sister.
It's a little hard to get
glass today, but I'll get it.
It is a magnificent building.
Thank you, Sister.
I know how you feel...
when I look at that
tumbled-down school.
I have one problem, however...
before my dream is complete.
It's a parking problem.
You see,
The Bogardus corporation...
will have
several hundred employees...
and they all have cars.
Parking's becoming
more of a problem every day.
Here's where my desk
is going to be.
Here are the blueprints.
It would take us
years to raise the money...
to build a building like this.
Oh, you could never do it.
You'd be surprised
what it's cost me.
Would you like to see
the rest of my building?
Oh, yes. By all means.
You just follow me.
Shall we ask him now?
Ever see anything like this?
It's tremendous, Mr. Bogardus.
15,000 square feet
without a column.
The balcony seats 400.
We can hold dances here,
conventions, everything.
It certainly is ideal.
It's perfect.
The Lord must have been
the architect.
I wish he had been.
I had Butler and Deane,
a couple of thieves.
Robbed me right and left.
It cost me 30%
over the estimate.
But you must be
happy with your accomplishment.
One thing
could make me happier...
and you know that.
I believe we're
thinking about the same thing.
Yeah?
It isn't what
we acquire in life, is it?
It's what we give.
And this is a monument to you.
I can see
the cornerstone reading...
"Donated to St. Mary's...
"through the generosity...
"and benevolence
of Horace P. Bogardus."
You're a very fortunate man,
Mr. Bogardus.
I am?
You know it's more blessed
to give than to receive.
This will live
long after you're dust.
Now that is real happiness.
Can't you just picture that?
Would you mind
saying that again?
Picture what? When I'm dust?
You don't have
to make up your mind right away.
Why don't you sleep on it?
I can't sleep now.
You shouldn't be surprised.
Sometimes we don't know
why we do things.
You didn't know
why you built this building.
I didn't? I thought I did.
You built it
in answer to our prayers.
We've been
praying and praying for this.
And we're going on praying.
Do you mean
to say you've got the idea...
We'll leave you now...
with this thought...
"Donated to St. Mary's...
"through the generosity
and benevolence...
"of Horace P. Bogardus."
Generosity...
benevolence...
and dust.
I'm sure that nice little man...
is going to give us
his building.
We must keep on praying until...
God's will be done?
And may God's will be our will.
What if our prayers
aren't answered?
Oh, thou of little faith.
We have reason to know...
more things
are wrought by prayer...
than this world dreams of.
Therefore, let thy voice...
rise like a fountain,
night and day.
What's all the excitement?
Notre Dame win another one?
No. I asked him.
- And?
- He didn't say no.
So you finally got here.
Been waiting for you fellas
since 6:00.
McKAY: Will you stop
flying off the handle?
You're working too hard, Horace.
You ought to be in bed.
With this building on my hands?
Should have been ready
three months ago.
You don't know
how much money I'm losing.
McKAY: If you're talking
about money, see your banker.
I'm your doctor.
You can't go on like this,
Horace.
You don't know
what I'm going through.
Took me three weeks
to get that glass.
There you are. Sign this.
What's this? What's all this?
What's all what? Sign it.
I want to know what I'm signing.
We get overtime after 6:00!
You should've
been here before 6:00. I was.
Didn't even leave to go
to my doctor's office.
One more crack,
we'll take that glass back...
and it'll take you six weeks
to get it put in.
Sign it.
See what I'm up against?
- Calm down, Horace.
- That's the way they do things.
McKAY: You mustn't let
anything upset you.
I know.
McKAY:
You're too big a man for that.
Go home
and get a good night's rest.
Nothing can take the place
of a good night's sleep.
Rest. Tranquillity. Relax.
A man in your position
hasn't got a worry in the world.
Just keep saying...
Save it. I won't feel it.
McKAY: Now what's the matter?
You don't know
what they're doing to me.
I'll stop that.
What's the matter with you,
Horace?
First, you're out of patience.
Now you're out of glass.
And now you want me to sleep.
What's new, Horace?
I heard the crash.
I wondered if anybody got hurt.
Father O'Malley,
Dr. McKay, my physician.
- How do you do, Doctor?
- Glad to know you, Father.
That's really too bad.
Isn't glass
hard to get these days?
Hard to get? I'll say it is.
Can't you get them
to stop that, Father?
McKAY: Stop it, Horace?
It's beautiful.
His nerves are all shot.
It's hardly noticeable.
What is that, Father?
Isn't that "O Sanctissime"?
That's right, Doctor.
Beautiful.
I've heard it many times.
How do the words go?
Do you know it, too?
I want to go home.
McKAY: Now you're making sense.
He's had a big day, Father.
Come in, Father.
- How are you, Mrs. Gallagher?
- Just fine.
Father, I was wondering
what's so important...
you couldn't tell me
over the telephone?
I don't know how to go about...
- Is it about Patsy?
- Yes.
What's happened, Father?
What's she done?
It's not bad news.
In fact,
this could be good news.
Oh, I'm so glad.
She's been getting along
so well...
If anything
should upset her now...
Take it easy.
Nothing has happened.
You said it had
something to do with Patsy.
Well, it has.
I found her father.
Joe?
Well, I think so.
I told him the story
as you told it to me.
I described you to him.
How on earth
did you run him down?
Once a piano player,
always a piano player.
I got him through
the Musician's Union.
I went right to the top...
Petrillo.
I really don't know what to say.
Neither do I.
Well, um...
is, uh, is he in town?
In town? He's out in the hall.
- Oh, no.
- Shall I bring him in?
Oh, no. Not... That is...
Wait just a minute, will you?
I, uh... you know.
She'll be a few minutes.
She's fixing her hair,
powdering her nose.
You know how it is.
Father, this is, uh...
kind of a big moment for me.
Mind you, it's 13 years.
I was a little bit younger then.
He hasn't exactly
been on ice, you know.
Well...
Well... shall we?
Hello.
Hello.
Good-bye.
- Don't go yet, Father.
- Please stay a little while.
All right.
Joe, sit down.
You, too, Father.
Sit down a little while.
You haven't changed a bit.
Neither have you, Joe.
Do me a favor, will you?
What's that?
Play the piano.
Please.
I want Father to hear you.
I've been telling him
all about you.
Listen to this.
He's really good.
What was that song
we used to love so much?
You mean "By the Sea"?
No, Joe.
No. It... it had a bit
of the Rosary in it.
Hmm hmm hmm hmm.
Hmm hmm hmm hmm.
Hmm hmm hmm hmm.
But that wasn't the melody.
Joe...
don't you remember?
We said that...
that no matter what happened...
that song
would always see us through.
And then we pressed the rosebud
in the book.
What happened?
Yeah.
Where's the book?
Ahem.
What's the matter?
Do you know it?
Why, sure.
That's an old song called...
"In the Land
of Beginning Again."
Why didn't you say so?
You never asked me.
Come on
over here and get in, then.
You'll be sorry.
There's a land of...
Beginning again.
Where skies...
Are always blue.
Though we've made mistakes...
That's true...
Let's forget the past...
And start life anew.
Though we've wandered...
By a river of tears...
Where sunshine...
Won't come through...
Let's find that paradise...
Where sorrow can't live...
And learn the teachings...
Of forget and forgive...
In the land of...
Beginning again...
Where broken dreams...
Come...
True.
The girls are excited,
aren't they, Sister?
Yes.
It reminds me
of when I graduated.
It's a big moment
in their lives.
It's the first time
they're wearing high heels.
I'm sure
I'll get the hang of it.
Look, Sister.
Yes, that's really nice, Patsy.
It's very... Push the sleeve up
a little bit like that.
It's a little long.
It's supposed to be, Sister.
Yes, but not...
Only on one side.
You don't want to stumble.
Sister Benedict's
giving Patsy all the attention.
That isn't right.
- Patsy's teacher's pet.
- Meow!
She is, too.
You gave her
the prettiest dress.
It would look better on me.
Girls,
I think that's about enough.
You better take
your dresses off.
I just got a funny idea.
Suppose, after all this,
I flunk?
I wouldn't worry.
- Would you do that to us?
- Oh, no.
It would be great
to cut out the finals entirely.
You can't
get around me that way.
Run along.
Take your dresses off.
Be careful.
- Sister?
- Yes, dear?
Can I show this dress
to my mother?
Yes.
That would make her very happy.
Thank you, Sister.
I know it will.
I'll get the tickets
to Syracuse.
- Good-bye, Joe.
- Good-bye, honey.
Hold it!
Would you like
a stick of gum?
I answered this one
two ways, Sister.
Yes and no.
- All right. Run along.
- Thanks.
I'm sorry, Patsy.
Time is up.
May I come in?
Don't get up.
I'm just the pastor.
Grading the papers, I see.
Yes, Father.
They're a wonderful
bunch of children.
You should
be very proud of them.
We are.
I ran into some of the girls.
They're dying with curiosity
about their marks.
I'm supposed to come in
and without your knowing...
find out how they turned out.
I presume you opened your heart
and passed them all?
All but one, Father.
Patsy?
Oh, no.
Well, this is only one subject.
The others are even worse.
Her average is below 60.
She got the date
and her name right.
Couldn't she get something
on that?
Add it up again,
maybe pass her?
Don't you think the honor
of the school means anything?
But what about Patsy?
St. Mary's isn't being
very much help to her.
Don't you think we should help
a child like that?
She's beginning
to believe in herself.
A blow like this, the child
may never get over it.
Do you believe in just passing
everybody, Father?
Maybe.
Maybe I do.
I can't believe you mean it.
It's easier for some
children to make the grade.
They don't have to study.
Some have the best marks
in school...
and never made
much of a mark afterward.
I knew a character once...
a fellow named
Elmer Hathaway.
He and I went through
school together.
Or rather,
I went through school.
Elmer just stood still.
I think he was three years
in the eighth grade.
He was quite a boy.
The teacher often wondered
how he found his way to school.
Sometimes he didn't.
Kids used to make fun of him.
He was sort of a dreamer.
Sometimes he'd forget
what day it was...
and he'd come to school
on Saturday.
Asked him who Plato was,
and he said, "Plato who?"
But he was good with his hands.
He built a boat...
a sailboat.
One time he disappeared
for two, three days.
When he came back...
they asked him
where he'd been...
and he said, "Oh, just sailing."
He got to be
about a foot taller...
than anybody in the class.
They felt sorry for him,
so they decided to pass him.
Besides, I think they needed
the desk at the time.
He never knew about it.
From that time on,
he developed assurance.
You've heard of
Hathaway Shipyards, haven't you?
- Yes.
- That's Elmer.
And to this day, he cares
for his less fortunate pals...
the ones who used to get
99 and 100.
If any of them are broke
or out of a job...
they can always work
for Hathaway.
He's a good man.
By the way...
just what is passing anyhow?
75, you know.
Yes, I know,
but who started it?
Our school is based on it.
If we don't have standards...
Yes?
But certainly
you're not serious?
I am.
Aren't we here
to help the children...
or are we here to measure
their brains with a yardstick?
Why do they have
to have 75 to pass?
- You'd put the standard at 65?
- Why not?
Then why not at 55?
Why any grades at all?
Why not let them run wild?
Better than
breaking their hearts.
That's unfair, Father.
My heart aches for Patsy...
and what you infer,
you're being very unjust.
Realize I've done everything
possible to help her...
but I must uphold our standards.
If you order me to pass her...
I shall do so.
But her mark remains the same.
Come in, Patsy.
Thank you, Sister.
- Hello, Father.
- Patsy.
I failed, didn't I, Sister?
Yes, you did, Patsy.
That's what I thought.
I'm sorry.
Well, that's all right, Sister.
It wasn't your fault.
I was... I was just thinking...
I won't be needing this now,
and...
well, Delphine liked it so much.
I was just thinking that, um...
I was just thinking...
that maybe I'll do better
next year, Sister.
Sister, you and I...
have had our differences
of opinion...
but they haven't been important.
This is serious.
I'm not ordering you
to do anything.
It's up to you, but...
But she failed.
Hooray, Luther!
Give him a hand, fellas.
Who's next?
Watch yourself, Bruce.
Go on. I'll be right back.
I'll go with Sister.
What's happened?
Sister Benedict's ill.
She fainted in the chapel.
Did you call a doctor?
- She doesn't want one.
- Oh, she doesn't, huh?
Come in.
Doctor's on his way.
How you feeling, Sister?
Who sent for a doctor?
She did.
You can't trust him.
He's an informer.
How are you feeling, Sister?
I feel all right.
Won't you sit down?
I want to talk to you.
Please excuse us.
What have I done now?
You've been writing.
You've been writing
to Mother General.
Oh?
Going over my head.
Yes, I received
that letter from her.
I just wrote expressing
my own opinion, Sister.
But I hope
that hasn't brought this on.
No.
No, I... I'm just tired.
But you actually considered
tearing down St. Mary's
and sending our children
to St. Victor's?
That's right. I thought
about it quite a bit.
We have to face facts, Sister.
Yes.
Yes, I know what you mean,
Father.
We've tried so hard...
not to face facts.
But there...
there must always be
a St. Mary's.
Of course, Sister.
Now, just relax. Take it easy.
Pardon me, but the doctor's...
Come in, Doctor.
- Hello, Father.
- This is Dr. McKay, Sister.
- Hello, Doctor.
- Hello, Sister.
He's Mr. Bogardus'
doctor, you know.
Oh, yes?
Are you his personal physician?
McKAY:
Yes. I have other patients...
possibly a hundred or so...
and Horace P. Bogardus.
Lately,
he's been a full-time job.
Rings me up
all hours of the night.
We pray for him all the time.
That's very nice.
He certainly could use it.
May I ask why?
They need a new school.
They're praying for him
to give them his building.
McKAY: Give? Bogardus?
Pardon me.
It's all right.
I have a sense of humor.
McKAY: Maybe your prayers
are having some effect.
He can't sleep nights.
I'm giving him sleeping tablets.
Prayer's a wonderful thing...
but if Bogardus ever gives you
that building, I'll...
Bup, bup.
Nothing spectacular, Doctor.
McKAY: OK.
Well, I can't do much here.
If you're able tomorrow,
come in for a checkup.
Nothing's wrong.
I'm just tired.
I know, but you let me
be the judge of that.
I want to know the cause
of your being tired.
- But I...
- She'll be there, Doctor.
McKAY: Keep right on praying,
Sister, but not tonight.
You need a good night's rest.
So does Bogardus.
McKAY:
Yes, that's right. Ha ha.
You heard what the man said.
You take it easy.
McKAY:
You won't forget, Father?
You'll see she gets
to the office tomorrow?
She has a mind of her own...
but I'll get her down there.
This anything serious?
McKAY: She's running
a little temperature.
She's had these attacks before?
That's what I heard today.
I hope it's nothing serious.
She's such a remarkable woman.
McKAY: I could tell that
when I walked into the room.
Does she really believe...
that Bogardus is going
to give that building?
Yes.
McKAY: Well,
I've heard of such things...
but I've never
come across it before...
not since I was a little boy...
and wished for what I wanted
for Christmas and got it.
It's sort of the same thing.
McKAY: But when we grow up,
we get practical.
She's not very practical,
is she?
She thinks she is.
McKAY: What'll she do
when she doesn't get...
You see?
Now she's got you worried.
McKAY: Yes, she has. I hate
to see her disillusioned.
Not to change
the subject... much...
but Bogardus has a bad heart,
doesn't he?
McKAY: Yes.
What are you
giving him for it, pills?
McKAY: Have you got
a better prescription?
Well, I knew a fellow once.
He had a very bad heart.
In fact, they only gave him
six months to live.
But he spent that six months
doing so much good...
do you know he lived to be 90?
McKAY: That so?
You mean doing good
for others...
is good for a bad heart?
Don't you spend
your life doing good for others?
McKAY: Yes... yes.
- How's your heart?
- Fine.
There you are.
McKAY: Are you tampering
with the laws of medicine?
We have a lot in common.
We're both interested
in the good heart.
McKAY: Your suggestion is that
I change my prescription?
You're the doctor.
McKAY:
I'm not so sure, O'Malley.
- Good day.
- Good day.
Mr. Bogardus.
Father O'Malley.
Oh, yes, Father.
Excuse me. I didn't see you.
You seemed to be
looking right past me.
My mind was miles away.
Yes, you don't seem
to be yourself today.
I'm not, Father.
I've just come from my doctor.
You know, Father...
if I had to live my life
over again...
there'd be
a lot of changes made.
Yeah?
Yeah, a lot of changes.
You know, there's great beauty
in this world...
if you just have the eyes
to see it, isn't there?
Oh, naturally.
Oh.
Thank you.
Ah, yes,
life can be very beautiful.
That's right.
Father, you've spent
your whole life...
doing things for people.
- No, I...
- Oh, yes, you have.
Come to think of it, Father,
how's your heart?
Great, great.
That's what I mean.
Would it be all right, Father,
if I go into the church?
You're perfectly welcome.
There it is.
And here's a thought
that might help you.
It's meant a lot to me.
I shall pass this way
but once.
If there's any good
I can do for anyone...
let me do it now
and not put it off...
for I shall not pass
this way again.
Oh, thank you, Father.
God bless you.
Thank you, Father.
Good-bye.
Wait a minute.
That's a puppy.
Oh, wait, wait.
Wait, wait.
Allow me, lady.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
It's a beautiful
world, isn't it?
You pretty near left it there.
I nearly did.
I'll get off to church.
Mr. Bogardus.
I'm sorry about this, Sister.
I didn't realize
he'd followed me to the church.
Sweet little fellow, isn't he?
That's quite all right.
Bring him anytime.
I mean, it doesn't matter.
I see that animals love you.
Oh, yes, but people don't.
You must be wrong.
I'm sure when people
get to know you, they love you.
No, no.
That's when they don't.
- You see, Sister...
- Yes, Mr. Bogardus?
I've never had any children
of my own.
And I've never even liked
children.
And they don't like me.
Why don't people like you?
Well, I've been very selfish.
And lately, I've been giving it
a lot of thought.
Come to any conclusion?
Yes.
This is going to surprise you.
And I do want people
to like me...
so... I was wondering...
if you would accept...
my building.
Oh!
What's the matter?
It's a bit of a shock to you?
Yes... yes.
Well, you can have it.
I'll go straight to my lawyer...
and have him
make out the deeds right away.
Thank you, Mr. Bogardus!
St. Mary's won't forget it,
and the children will love you.
I'll have the papers
made out right away.
Come on, doggy.
Come on, come on.
Aah! Aah!
What happened?
All right, back it away,
back it away.
What's the big idea?
I don't need any help.
Mr. Bogardus, how are you?
- I'm all right!
- And your legs?
OK. No bones broken.
Oh, Father O'Malley.
Well, Sister, that was lovely.
What is it called?
It means, uh...
"It's spring."
Don't let me stop you.
Sing something else.
What do we know?
How about, uh...
Do you know "Birmingham Bertha"?
No.
How about the school song then?
Sister has a new version of it.
- She's proud of it.
- Well, sing that.
Won't you
sing the melody, Father?
Sister, you talked me into it.
Ding dong.
Ding dong.
Ding dong.
Ding.
Oh, bells of St. Mary's...
We always will love you.
With your inspiration...
We never will fail.
Your chimes will forever...
Bring sweet mem'ries of you.
So proudly ring out...
While we sing out...
Hail, hail, hail!
So proudly ring out...
While we sing out...
Hail...
Hail...
Hail.
Ding dong.
Ding.
Won't you ring dem bells?
Haven't had a chance
like that in years.
I had to try it.
- Father.
- Yes?
- The doctor's here.
- Oh, good.
- How are you, Father?
- Hello, Doctor.
McKAY: Sister Benedict
was in to see me.
She's in great spirits,
the happiest person alive.
Isn't it wonderful
what faith can do?
McKAY: Everyone's so happy
around here...
I hate to be
the bearer of bad news.
I examined Sister Benedict.
Can she be sent away
for a while?
Why? Where?
McKAY: Some place like Arizona,
for instance?
You see this area here?
- Yes, why?
- That's the right lung.
McKAY: And here, in this area...
I never could
make out those things.
What is it, Doctor, TB?
Yes.
A very early stage.
McKAY: It's not that bad.
We're lucky to catch it
right now.
That's why I asked
if she could be sent...
to a drier climate...
to an infirmary
or a home for old people...
some place where she could have
light duties...
not another school.
If it has to be done,
I guess it can be done, but...
not to be with children...
McKAY: Not for a while.
Not until this condition's
cleared up.
Does she know about this?
Not yet. It's very important
that she doesn't know it.
She has a wonderful vitality,
a natural optimism...
and that's the best medicine
anyone can have.
If that spirit is dampened...
it would have a depressing
effect and delay her recovery.
She'll have to know about it.
We can't just send her away.
Don't you people go where
you're told without question?
Yes, and we're supposed
to have...
the stamina to take it.
McKAY: She has plenty of that.
But you don't
quite understand, Doctor.
You see...
Sister and I
haven't always agreed...
on how to run the school.
It's about one rather serious
difference of opinion.
Now, if she's sent away without
any explanation, why...
she's bound to think that...
Up to here, Father,
we were discussing her health...
what's best for her.
Now we're discussing
your feelings.
It's a heck of a way to put it.
McKAY: I only want
to see her get well.
I guess I can see to it
that she's transferred, but...
not to tell her why...
send her away without
any explanation...
You would put it that way.
Her opinion of me
or her health.
Right down here, men.
There.
All right.
Just straighten it a little bit.
There, that's...
Yes, that's right. Thank you.
This is... -
Go up there.
There.
Be sure to leave room
for their knees.
You know how they go.
You remember.
- Good morning, Father.
- Morning, Sister.
Look out, Father,
you're in the way.
Here,
let me help you with that.
There.
Just put it down there.
I'm glad you're here.
There's lots on my mind.
I want to talk to you, too.
When you bring
the desk, put it over here.
Yes, Sister.
Let's go
where there's less noise.
Now we can finally
tear down our old school...
and that can become
our playground.
It's all so wonderful.
And I'm tired.
I'll sit down for a minute.
Working too hard.
You shouldn't be lifting things.
It must be all the excitement.
What was I going to say?
Yes, about commencement.
Did you ask Mr. Bogardus?
- Yes, and the doctor.
- Fine. He's a nice man.
He telephoned and said
I had nothing to worry about.
I'll have you know he said
there's nothing wrong with me.
I'm perfect.
That is good news.
Yes, isn't it?
Do you want me
to thank Bogardus publicly?
Oh, yes, by all means...
and convey
our sincere gratitude...
for his wholehearted generosity.
But don't make a long speech.
I'll be the soul of brevity.
The children will be restless...
and the parents
will be interested only in them.
But impress upon
the graduating class...
that they must never give up
their pursuit of learning...
and at all times carry
uppermost in their minds...
the ideals of St. Mary's.
Yes, I think that'll
take care of everything, Father.
If you think
I'll be long-winded...
why don't you write the speech?
I have, Father. I have it here.
And I have one more wish...
that the next year will be
a joyous and successful one...
and that we'll never have
any more misunderstandings.
Serious ones, I mean.
I know how you feel
about Patsy.
You still disagree with me,
don't you?
Father...
sometimes we have to do things
that aren't easy.
No matter
how much they hurt us...
we have to do
what we believe is right.
I have something to tell you,
Sister...
that isn't going to be easy.
What is that, Father?
You'll be notified shortly...
that Sister Michael is going
to be in charge next year.
Oh, she...
She'll be so happy.
And I?
Will...
will I... I be her assistant?
It's only fair to tell you,
Sister...
that you're being transferred.
It's going to be difficult
to leave St. Mary's.
But we shouldn't become
too attached to any one place.
Any other school
may seem strange at first...
but as long as
I'm around children...
I'll be happy.
How do you know all this?
Have you been writing
Mother General again?
Will I be here for graduation?
Yes, Sister, of course.
Is this the desk that
goes in your office, Sister?
Yes.
Yes.
Was there anything else
you had to say, Father?
That was all?
Yes, Sister.
I'll go with you.
Sorry
you couldn't be with us, Pat.
Thanks, Del.
What happened to my dress?
Sister has it.
It didn't fit me.
Too many milk shakes.
Well, better luck next year.
I'll be rooting for you.
Thanks.
Where is she?
Which one's Patsy?
I... I don't see her.
I'll look for her.
You go find Father O'Malley.
OK.
Who is that?
My mother, Sister.
Is she here for the exercises?
I guess so.
You didn't tell her
you're not graduating?
No, Sister.
My dear child, why not?
She's been out of town.
It's embarrassing, Patsy,
I know...
but you mustn't feel so badly
about not graduating.
If we don't fail sometimes...
our successes
won't mean anything.
You must have courage.
Don't give up.
I'll explain to your mother,
so she won't think ill of you.
I know she loves you,
and you love her...
and where there's love,
there's understanding.
If you ask me,
nobody understands anything.
You don't understand anything...
Father O'Malley
doesn't understand anything...
my mama does...
Oh, Sister, I'm sorry.
What is troubling you, Patsy?
Oh, Sister, help me.
Oh, please help me.
Yes, of course.
Of course I want to help you.
I want to be a nun, Sister.
How can I become a nun
like you?
There's one thing I do know...
something is troubling you.
No. I just want to be a nun.
You don't say it that way,
my dear.
"I want to be a nun."
You don't become a nun
to run away from life, Patsy.
It's not because
you've lost something.
It's because
you've found something.
You're still a little girl.
You don't know yet.
Oh, but I do.
I just want to be like you.
You don't know what
the next four years will bring.
You haven't been
to high school yet.
Those are years
you'll always treasure.
New companions, new interests...
lots of fun...
as well as study.
Going to parties.
Football games.
Your first prom.
Your first party dress.
Your first waltz.
You can't give up these things
if you know nothing about them.
Not until you've known
all this...
and more...
can you say
with complete understanding...
"I want to be a nun."
Oh, but I can. I can!
I know them all now.
Well, then, Patsy,
that's another thing.
Your marks aren't good enough.
You have to pass
your examinations.
But I could have.
I could have passed.
I didn't want to.
You mean you failed
on purpose?
I thought I could stay here
another year.
Everything's so nice here,
Sister.
You don't know.
Everything's so clean...
and so good and...
even if I am
in the same grade...
I don't care.
I'd be with you.
Oh, Patsy.
I'm beginning to see
what's wrong.
Did Father O'Malley
know about this?
Nobody knows, Sister.
Nobody but me.
"I."
No, Sister, you're wrong.
"But" can be used
as a preposition...
as well as a conjunction...
and then it takes
the objective case.
That was on the examination,
wasn't it?
Uh-huh. And I missed it.
I'm brighter
than you think I am.
Ask me more questions.
I wouldn't be a dumb nun.
Oh, Patsy.
Sister, this is
Mr. And Mrs. Joe Gallagher.
Patsy's mother and father.
How do you do?
Patsy, your father.
Hello, Patsy.
Don't look at me like that,
Patsy.
Give me time.
I may grow on you.
Darling, don't cry.
Everything's going
to be different from now on.
Mommy and daddy are going
to see that you have a home...
a real home...
and have a room all your own.
You can have children over...
as often as you like.
You...
Well, you...
You won't be lonely anymore.
Oh, mama!
Oh, mama!
Is this my real daddy?
Yes, darling.
Yes.
We came to see you graduate.
Isn't it time
you were getting ready?
We were just about
to get ready...
weren't we, Patsy?
Yes, Sister.
How were her marks, Father?
I didn't see her report card.
Her marks?
They were exceptional.
There wasn't a child
in the class anywhere near her.
Oh.
This is indeed
a great day for St. Mary's...
the first birthday
of the new St. Mary's.
There's the old, here's the new.
We owe it all to the generosity
and benevolence of one man...
a man whose name
will be graven...
on our cornerstone
and in our hearts...
for many years to come.
Speaking of hearts...
a truly great heart
beats in the bosom...
of Mr. Horace P. Bogardus.
Mr. Bogardus
is a very modest man.
When you have a heart
that loves children...
that thinks only of others...
that's capable
of doing so much good...
then you have a heart...
that can laugh at the years.
Mr. Bogardus
is a fine example...
of the joy of giving.
To him, every day is Christmas.
Indeed,
he has holly in his heart.
Thank you.
St. Mary's is founded on faith,
hope, and charity.
The greatest of these
is charity.
A gift to the church
is deductible.
So thank Mr. Bogardus
for his generous gift.
Now I'd like to say
a few words...
to the boys and girls
of our graduating class.
I'll make it very brief.
Today is a joyous one for you
because you're graduating.
It's also a sad one because
you're leaving St. Mary's.
I can't sum up
in a few minutes...
what you've learned
in eight years.
What you're taking with you...
isn't just what's in the books.
That's important,
but it isn't everything.
What you're taking with you...
is what you have to give
to others...
what the good sisters
have taught you.
If any of you
are ever in trouble...
no matter what...
you just dial "O"...
for O'Malley.
Did you order the cab?
Yes.
It will be waiting outside.
Sister Benedict in the chapel?
Why?
Dear Lord...
Dear Lord...
remove all bitterness
from my heart.
Please...
help me to see thy holy will...
in all things.
Help me.
Please.
Oh, please help me.
Are you going
with me, Sister Angela?
Yes, Sister.
Good-bye, Sister.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Sister.
Good-bye.
- Good-bye, Sister.
- Good-bye, Sister.
Good-bye, Sister Genevieve.
You know that wherever I am...
my heart will always be
with St. Mary's.
Good-bye, Sister Benedict.
Good-bye, Sister Michael.
Father...
Sister,
we know your heart will be here.
We'll always remember you
in our prayers.
Thank you.
- Good-bye, Father.
- Good-bye.
Sister?
Sister Benedict?
Sister,
I can't let you go like this.
You know, when Dr. McKay said
you were perfect...
he was right...
for that's what you are.
But he didn't mean physically...
because, Sister...
you have a touch
of tuberculosis.
Oh, Dr. McKay felt that...
you shouldn't know about this,
but I fe...
Thank you, Father.
Thank you.
You've made me very happy.
I'll get well quickly now.
Of course you will, Sister...
and if you ever need anything,
no matter what it is...
or wherever you happen to be...
Yes.
I know.
I'll just dial "O" for O'Malley.
Right.
