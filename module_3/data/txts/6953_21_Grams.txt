Check, please.
Look, Daddy. A volcano.
Very pretty.
Now drink up your volcano.
All right. we're going.
Mommy's waiting.
Please. Just one more minute.
No, we're going.
No.
Yes.
No.
Yes.
Until l ended up flatlining
at the hospital.
But l survived, and instead of
letting that scare me l kept on going.
Until my first daughter was born.
And now l look at my girls and...
my husband...
who's been standing by me
for so long -
Think which one
you're going to pull out.
l always think.
No, you don't.
They didn't lock you up this time
because you're not eighteen yet.
Next time they're gonna lock you up,
brother.
Come on.
You're not thinking.
Stealing might get you money,
you tap some cheerleader's ass ...
show off riding some pickle-colored
Thunderbird,...
but what's gonna happen if you shoot
a pregnant woman or an old man?
You know what will happen?
The guilt will suck you down
to the bone.
Stealing ain't worth it.
Goin' to church, reading the Bible...
and believing in Jesus, brother,
that's your ticket.
You think it's a fantasy, right?
Come here, man. Get up. Come here.
You see that truck?
Beauty, ain't it?
l won it at a friend's raffle.
No shit.
No shit. You know what?
lt wasn't luck.
lt was Jesus who wanted me
to have that truck.
That's bullshit. l bet you stole it.
Jesus gave me that truck.
And it's He who gives,
and He who takes away.
Yeah, right.
He doesn't give a shit about us.
Come back!
Take off your hat.
Take off that hat!
God even know when a single hair
moves on your head.
You're wrong, Nick.
So this is death's waiting room.
These ridiculous tubes.
These needles swelling my arms.
what am l doing in this
pre-corpse club?
what do l have to do with them?
l don't know when anything
began anymore...
or when it's gonna end.
who'll be the first to
lose their life?
He, in the coma?
Or me?
Alright. You can get dressed now.
Your fallopian tubes are
severely damaged.
lt looks like you had an
infection that...
wasn't taken care of properly.
we can try surgery,
but l have to tell you...
l think the probabilities are slim.
Excuse me for asking this,
but it's important
that you tell me the truth
Have you ever had an abortion?
Yes.
Any reason?
l had already separated
from my husband
when l got pregnant...
l meant medical reason.
My husband's dying.
l'm sorry?
Paul, my husband, he's dying.
And l want to have his baby.
we can operate
and hope you get pregnant
within a few months.
He's got one month left. At most.
How did it go?
Not good, Reverend.
ln one ear and out the other.
Be patient.
All it takes is one sheep
in a thousand.
wolf, you still havin'
that birthday party wednesday?
My place, brother.
l may be late.
l have Bible class wednesday.
Back off.
l told you to think.
Fuck you!
Hit me. Hit me.
Leave it, Jack!
He's just a kid. Jack!
He's a punk, Reverend.
No, he's a kid.
You think, Jack.
You think.
For those who are making decisions
that affect our lives,...
we must call out to God to
give them His wisdom.
l'll see you tomorrow.
l'll pick the boys up
after school if you want.
How's my queen? And Hercules?
Freddy, help me out.
l got the cooler from
the religious center.
Dad, are we gonna go buy a dog now?
Freddy, we agreed - no dogs.
why not? You said if l got a good
grades you'd buy me one.
we've been through
this a thousand times.
Your sister has allergies
and dog hair is bad for her.
Bad for her. Not me.
Get me a dog.
No, and that's the end of it.
well, at least give me a hamster.
well, we'll see.
we'll see.
You always say ''You promise''.
Hey, wolf -
you back, motherfucker?
Lock down six.
Six down.
l win.
Age before beauty.
You're such a sore loser.
You want to go to the jacuzzi
for a while?
l can't.
Michael and the girls are waiting
for me already.
Okay. Call me later.
l'll call you.
Christina.
lf you get away from leading
your family like a man of God...
ought to lead his family -
in prayer and reading
the word of God,...
and the things of God,
and bringing them to
the house of God,...
then you're opening the door
for the Devil to come in
and slay your family.
Jesus is our life.
Jesus is our hope.
Jesus is our forgiveness.
Jesus is the water that
quenches my thirst.
lf you're saved and you know it,
say ''Amen.''
Everybody up on your feet.
Jesus is our life.
Honey, l'm home.
You scared me. How are you feeling?
l feel great.
Have you been smoking again?
Oh fuck, Paul
lf they find out you're smoking,
they'll take you off
the transplant list.
lf l don't smoke l'll go nuts.
Better nuts than dead.
l don't know how you get them.
Baby...
Oh, God.
Call an ambulance.
Call a fucking ambulance!
God damn it!
Please, do something.
Come on.
Jack, the boss wants to talk to you.
He want to see you now.
C'mon, we both know
l'm not a caddie yet.
But l'm working at it.
And l'm learning, Brown.
l swear to God,
l'm not gonna let you down.
No, Jack. That's not the problem.
what's the problem?
Some members have started
complaining about your tattoos.
l got a long-sleeved shirt.
No long-sleeved shirt gonna
cover that one on your neck.
You gonna start wearing a scarf?
Jack, this club is for people
different from me and you.
l don't drink, l don't steal.
l'm clean. Tell me - why me?
l know you're clean.
That's why l hired you.
But this decision comes
from the administration.
lf l don't follow through,
they're gonna fuck me, too.
l cut you a hefty severance check
you can pick up at the cashier's.
Try to understand.
Good. ls there any pain?
My head hurts a little bit.
That's normal because of
the blood pressure medicine.
we'll get you something else
to make you feel better.
l brought you what you asked for.
Oh, my God.
ls that my heart?
The culprit.
which one is he?
That's him, in the brown vest.
He's putting the bag on top.
Are you okay?
l want to kill him.
Thank you, Lord,
for keeping us together,
for filling us with love...
and for giving us this meal. Amen.
l got fired from the club today.
lt's your good pal Brown, right?
lt had nothing to do with him.
You believe that?
Yes, l do.
Freddy, stop it.
Freddy hit me on the arm.
which arm, baby?
This one.
Hold out your other arm
and let your brother hit you.
Jack, no!
Hold it out.
''whoever slaps you on the right cheek,
turn the other to him also.''''
Hit her. Don't be afraid. Hit her!
That's great. wonderful.
Good parenting.
Good job. lt's Ok.
He didn't hurt her.
There's no hitting in this house.
You understand?
Get in the corner.
Should l put the chocolate
chips in now, Mommy?
That's right, honey. And then stir.
Laura, put that back. Come on.
when's Daddy coming home?
lf you keep behaving like
this he won't be...
Now, Laura. Stop it, now.
Next Friday,
ask Lupe to stay the night.
l can't stay because l invited
the company managers for dinner.
l fired her.
You fired her? why?
She made me feel like a cripple.
God damn it, Paul.
So now who's going to cook for you?
who's going to clean up after you?
who's going to take care of you? who?
l can do it for myself.
You can do it by yourself?
l can't do it anymore.
Really, l can't.
what are you doing?
what does it feel like l'm doing?
Don't. You might hurt yourself.
l'm not gonna hurt myself.
Besides, l need you...
l went to a fertility clinic.
Oh, good. More doctors.
l can't have this discussion again.
This is a specialist.
He said that with surgery...
l might get pregnant.
You need to donate sperm and -
l could take care of him.
But l can't. So what's the point?
This is what l most want in the world.
Do it for me. Please.
This is gonna be fifty-eight
ninety-five
Thank you.
Did you find everything you need, sir?
lt's gonna be hot.
when does my brother plan to show up?
He said he'd be back by six.
One hundred percent pure golden lager.
Are you out of your mind?
lt's warm.
lf you wanna drink lemonade all night,
just give it to me.
Katie? Laura?
where are you guys?
Hi, sweetheart. lt's Dad.
l was hoping we could have lunch
one day next week.
Give me a call.
Hi, honey, l'm on my way home.
lf you need anything-
Look, Daddy, a pigeon.
Girls, no. Don't touch.
Laura, stop it.
Gimme a call on my cell.
l'll see you in a bit. Bye.
Speaking.
what?
where?
Stay here. l'll be right back.
You understand that even if
the operation is successful,...
artificial insemination doesn't
always work.
lt doesn't matter. we want to try.
Paul?
This is about having a child...
and with your condition you
probably won't ever meet him.
Life goes on, right?
Put on one of these gloves to avoid
contaminating the sample.
And try to make it all land
in the receptacle.
when you're done,
just leave it in here.
ln case you need a little inspiration.
Excuse me.
My husband and daughters were
in an accident
and l was told to come here.
what were their names?
Michael, Katherine and Laura Peck.
Excuse me for a minute.
what happened, sweetheart?
l don't know. They haven't told me
anything yet.
lt's gonna be alright.
what is the most important question
for safe sex?
what time does your husband get home?
His Highness has arrived home.
Let's see what he comes up with.
Serve up that chili.
Seven o'clock.
what're you gonna make up this time,
traffic?
Preachin' the word?
The entire congregation's
been waiting for you.
lt's your party, remember?
what's wrong?
Have you been drinking?
You didn't drink again, did you?
l just ran over a man and two girls.
You're lying, right?
l was driving home... took a turn...
a little too quickly and
didn't see them crossing.
Can't you go any faster?
Oh, baby. l'm here.
l love you.
Deep breath.
Good. Your lungs are clear.
l got a question for you.
whose heart do l have?
l can't tell you.
lt's hospital regulations.
Just like the donor's family doesn't
know your name either.
But you know.
This is your heart now.
That's all that should matter to you.
l want to know who saved my life.
You can write anonymously to the family
through the donor's association.
Personally, l think it's better
that you don't know.
Mrs. Peck? l'm Dr. Jones.
what happened to my family?
Please, sit down.
l'm okay. what happened?
Your husband and your daughters
were hit by a car.
we had to perform emergency surgery
on your husband.
Your husband suffered multiple
skull fractures
and we had to remove blood clots
from around the brain.
He's in critical condition.
And we're concemed that he's showing
low brain activity.
ls he going to be alright?
we're doing the best we can.
And what about my daughters?
Your youngest daughter was brought
in with severe bleeding.
She just wasn't able to get here
in time.
l'm very sorry.
They both died in the accident.
No, oh my God.
Oh my God.
No, oh my God.
where are they?
where are they?
Your girls are here and
you can see them if you like.
l want to see them.
l wouldn't recommend it.
Oh, God.
l'm very sorry.
lf you'll excuse us,
we have to get back to Mr. Peck.
l'm very sorry.
Oh. Oh. Oh, God. Oh.
Oh, God, l can't breathe.
we want dinner we want dinner.
Marianne,
we'd like some dinner in here.
Tell Reverend John to stay.
Make sure no one notices...
and get everyone to leave.
But what happened?
Trish, just do what l tell ya.
Okay, baby. lt's gonna be okay...
Start the truck up.
Pull it in, c'mon, baby.
Hey, Jack.
what are you doing here, man?
Just came to pick up my things, Brown.
why don't you let me buy you
a couple of beers, huh?
l don't drink, Brown.
l'll buy you a Diet Coke?
Y'know, l've been talking
to a buddy of mine
about hooking you up with a job.
Been telling him all about you.
So what do you say, huh?
l been feeling shitty about
what went down. C'mon.
l understand.
So what do you say?
As you know,
the doctors did everything
they could to save your husband's life,
but he has shown no brain activity.
we're here to help you...
with some of the final decisions
that need to be made.
we have a patient who is gravely ill.
l'm here to give you some information
on organ donation.
Are you willing for your husband
to donate his heart?
Can we discuss this another time?
l'm afraid not.
l can give you time to discuss it,
but this is a decision that
needs to be made soon.
Paul.
Paul, the beeper.
lt's the hospital.
l think they've got a heart.
Hello?
Yes, l'm calling on behalf
of Mr. Paul Rivers.
Yes.
Okay. Yes, l understand.
where do l have to take him?
Good luck, my love.
Hello.
Hello.
Does your shoulder bother you?
why?
Because l was watching you swing
before and you have a wide stroke.
lf you bring it in tighter
you'll get a better glide.
Thanks for the advice.
Do you mind if l join you?
Actually, l was just leaving.
Maybe just until you finish?
No. Maybe next time.
Did you know that eating alone
can cause kidney damage?
And that's bad.
Hello?
Hello. ls Ana there?
what?
ls Ana there?
Hang on a sec.
Ana.
Ana.
Hello?
Hello?
Hi, honey. l'm on my way home.
lf you need me to pick up
anything along the way just -
Look, Daddy. A pigeon.
Girls, no. Don't touch.
Laura, stop it.
Gimme a call on my cell.
l'll see you in a bit. Bye.
Did you go?
Are they dead?
l'm gonna turn myself in.
John says nobody saw you. Nobody.
They don't know a license plate
or what kind of car.
Some asshole even swears it...
Marianne, what would you do
if these were our children?
Tell me.
But they're not.
lt didn't happen to us.
No, it didn't happen to us.
lt happened to me.
what the fuck do you gain
by turning yourself in?
lt's my duty, Marianne.
No, Jack.
Your duty is here with us...
with your family.
My duty is to God.
please.
Marianne, get out of my way.
Oh, buddy, right there.
My turn.
l think l better go back
to the hospital.
what is this?
Hey, hey! l thought your doctor said
you're not supposed to eat that.
l'm making up for lost time.
Lost time, not lost pounds.
we'll have to send you back
for liposuction.
well, here's to all those who didn't
think l was gonna die, huh?
Yeah.
And to the first day of my new life.
Yeah. Cheers.
Congratulations.
lt's good to have you home, man.
l also have an announcement to make.
l wanted to tell you that Paul
and l are going to be parents.
There's a scary thought -
Paul being a parent.
You kept this real quiet.
Have you told your parent's?
No. we're going to be parents,
we just don't know when yet.
l'm going to have an operation
and then we're going to
try artificial insemination.
Terrific.
Artificial insemination, huh?
Professor, do your female students
know you have no lead in your pencil?
Hey.
C'mon.
Oh.
Play...nice.
Let's pass the cake around.
Mr. Donneaud?
Mr. Rivers?
Yeah.
Thanks for comin'.
Sorry l couldn't cancel
this appointment,
but the way l'm bowlin' today,
l probably should have.
Have a seat here. Park it right there.
Can l bring you something to eat?
l'm not hungry.
Honey, you need to eat something.
l'm fine, Dad.
when your mother died,
l thought l wasn't going to make it.
l felt the world was falling on me
and that l was never going to get up.
But sweetie, life goes on.
You know what l thought when mom died?
l couldn't understand how you
could talk to people again.
How you could laugh... again.
l couldn't understand
how you could play with us.
And no - no, that's a lie.
Life does not just go on.
Louise is getting fat,
don't you think?
She's done nothing but eat
since Robert left her.
what, she looks okay to you?
why did you tell everybody
we're having a baby?
l wanted to share our plans with them.
That's what l mean. They're our plans.
why does everyone have to
know our private life?
why the fuss?
They're our best friends.
But we haven't even talked about it.
Oh, we haven't?
l thought this was more than settled.
Things change, Mary.
Something we have to think about.
l don't have anything to think about.
l've already made my decision.
would you help me with the glasses?
Do you want me to stay
with you tonight?
l'm okay, thanks.
l just want to be alone.
Cris...
The police called.
They said you need to go
and press charges.
l'll go with you if you want.
l'm not gonna do anything.
This guy was, was some ex-...con.
Are you really gonna let him
just walk the streets?
what do you want me to do?
well, he ran over Michael and
your daughters. Maybe...
Nothing l can do is going
to bring them back.
Do you get that?
Hey, how're you doin'?
You find it okay?
Yeah, l did.
The donor's name was Michael Peck.
He was thirty-seven years old,
an architect and married.
This is the authorization for
transplant signed by his wife,...
Christina williams Peck.
l have a copy of the medical
report if you care to see it.
And l also have the widow's
phone number
and address just in case
you're interested.
How did Michael Peck die?
You might have,
seen it in the news-paper.
This guy named Jack...
This guy named Jack Jordan
ran over Mr. Peck ...
and his two little girls
October 10th at six-fifty p.m.
This Jack Jordan's a piece of work.
He's been in and out of jail
since he was sixteen.
Car thief, small time crook,
drugs, bad checks, alcoholism.
Last time he was in jail's
only been two years ago.
You feelin' okay, Mr. Rivers?
That's what you wanted.
He's an architect.
what's the point in getting involved?
l just need to know who l am now.
l don't think that's the way to do it.
what is, then?
Look for it with me.
Let's look ahead together, not behind.
Damn it, Jack, it's your birthday and
you didn't even have one drink with me.
why don't you come over to my place?
l'm having a party.
Yeah, but l bet they're all
as boring as you are.
You might be surprised.
Nah, man, l'll pass.
Listen, l'll call you later
about that job, okay?
Alright.
Thank you.
Hey, Brown. You should.
l will.
Okay, now, we can schedule
the surgery, um,...
l could get you in as early as Monday.
Yeah.
Nine a.m.?
what's the percentage chance
that Mary will get pregnant?
well, l can't offer you
a real number on that.
Um, y'know, there's the damage
from the abortion...
that wasn't handled properly -
the blockage -
what abortion, Mary?
l can explain.
Explain what?
There is an explanation.
All the drama about artificial
insemination,...
the kids' names -
we've got pictures of our
friend's babies all over the place.
why? So you can flush it down
the fucking toilet?
we've been a fraud for a long time,
Mary?
Oh, yeah? why didn't you tell me
that when you were sick?
Or did you expect one of your
girlfriends to come
and take care of you?
You came back because you wanted to.
Don't blame me for that.
l came back to take care of you
because l love you.
Or because you were feeling lonely.
l'm sorry.
we can't keep going like this.
The insemination, the child.
l think we're trying to put a band-aid
on something that's just been bled dry.
lt's finished.
But it isn't finished, if we give it
a chance and have this baby.
But when we could have,
you didn't want to.
we were separated, goddamn it.
lt's different now.
Yes. lt's different.
You ready to go?
You only know how to
think about yourself.
Close six.
well, thanks for finally seeing me.
They tell me you don't want to eat.
l'm not hungry.
Jack, Jesus didn't
come to free us from pain.
He came to give us
the strength to bear it.
Maybe He wanted this pain for me.
No, He had nothing to do with this.
lt was an accident.
No, it wasn't an accident.
Jesus chose me for this.
Jack - ask for the mercy
of Jesus Christ.
lf it was an accident,
why do l have to ask for His mercy?
''l will have mercy on whom
l will have mercy.
l will have compassion on whom
l will have compassion.''
Don't be so prideful. That's a sin.
''And the fearful, and unbelieving,...''
''and the abominable,
and murderers and the warmongers
and the sorcerers and idolaters and ''
Jesus, Jesus came to save us,
not to damn us.
the lake which burneth
with fire and brimstone.''
Revelation 21 .8.
Jesus loves you,...
but He also knows how to punish
arrogant sinners like you.
''As many as l love l rebuke and
chasten.'' Revelation 3.19.
Jesus betrayed me.
Stop that shit or you're
going straight to hell.
Hell? This is Hell. Right here.
You're damning your soul.
You shut up now and
ask Christ to forgive you.
Hey! Forgive me?
l did everything he asked me to do.
l changed.
l gave Him my life.
And He betrayed me.
He put that fucking truck
in my hands...
so l could carry out His will, made me
kill that man and those girls.
But hey, He didn't give me the
strength to stay and save them.
Don't blaspheme, you bastard.
Christ had nothing to do with this.
God even knows when a single hair moves
on your head.
And you taught me that.
l'm gonna pray for you, Jack.
Just like old times, huh?
where the hell have you been?
Did you end up marrying that hunk you
brought around here last time?
Yep.
Yeah?
ls he a good lay?
How they make us suffer, huh?
That's alright.
l got some great candy for you.
Special K, angel dust.
And your old-time favorite.
And...
And l got the newest of the new,...
R-2.
This shit's all the rage.
You take two of these,
you go straight to heaven.
l'm not into chemicals.
Cristi, you're not a cuddly
little kitty, now, are you?
Look, if you don't like 'em,
you don't pay for 'em.
That's my girl.
Busy.
Hey, go easy on the booze tonight,
right?
what the fuck?
what the fuck are you doing?
You're in no condition to drive.
what do you care, asshole?
l can get you a cab.
l don't need a fucking taxi.
Just gimme the glass, ma'am.
That way you won't -
Stupid fucking asshole! Move your car!
l'm fine. Get away from my car.
There's no damage.
Jesus.
There's no damage.
Excuse me, l know her.
l can drive her home. Excuse me.
ls this any of your business?
l'm your friend, Paul,
from the sports club.
Yeah, well -
Remember?
Yeah, well, can, can you tell
these assholes to get away from me?
Yeah, okay.
l'll drive her home.
lt's not a big deal. Okay?
You can't drive like this.
what do you care?
You're gonna get arrested.
Let me drive you.
Please.
Damn it.
l sold the truck to pay
for the lawyer.
l didn't ask for a lawyer.
Marianne, l didn't ask for a lawyer.
You want your children to spend
another two years without you?
ls that what you want?
This is God's will. So be it.
Two years ago,
you didn't believe in anything.
Now everything has to do with God.
l think l preferred you the way
you were before.
l was a fucking pig before.
ls that what you prefer?
At least it was you.
Now l don't have the slightest
fucking idea who you are.
Life has to go on, Jack,
with or without God.
Hey, how you doin'?
How are you?
Fine.
were you able to find anything out?
Jack Jordan's livin' in a cheap motel
lost out in the middle of nowhere.
Phone records.
One of his prison fishy pals
is from there.
That was quick.
Just a matter of checkin' the calls.
Phone number and address
for the motel he's living in.
Here's a pretty recent photo
of Jordan.
lt was taken the last time
he was in jail.
were you able to get that
other thing that l asked about?
This is a plain gun, no record.
They call this an orphan.
lt is loaded.
whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa...
Careful, there, Hoss.
You don't have to cock it.
Just pull the trigger to shoot it.
This releases the cylinder.
Yeah. l think you're set to go.
That's all l want to know.
Thank you.
Good luck to ya.
Cristina Peck. Ma'am,
it's been an hour since l called.
46 St. Vincent Street.
Thank you.
Hello.
Hello.
Boy, some rain.
Do you not have your car?
No, but...
my taxi will be here in a minute.
l'm right over here.
l can give you a lift if you like.
No, thanks.
l'm the guy who drove your car home
last week.
l'm sorry, l don't remember.
l left my jacket with you.
l'm sorry - l'll bring it by tomorrow.
You sure l can't give you a ride?
l'm right here.
Or do you want to swim?
Okay.
Hello.
Thanks.
You're very welcome.
Let me just give you my cell

Hi, honey, l'm on my way home.
Look, Daddy, a pigeon!
Daddy,...look,...
Girls no! Don't touch it.
Laura, stop it.
Gimme a call on my cell.
l'll see you in a bit. Bye.
Good night, Mr. Peck.
Hey, Lucio. Don't forget to do
my garden on Saturday.
l won't forget.
Son of a bitch.
Leave it to me, Marianne.
Sometimes it happens,
sometimes it doesn't.
Everybody reacts differently.
That's why you've been
vomiting so much.
So, what are you saying?
l've got to change medication?
Okay, l'm gonna be frank
with you, Paul.
The heart that you're carrying
is gonna give out soon.
l need you to stay in the hospital
until l can find you another heart.
You want me to wait for a new heart.
we don't have another choice.
l can't do that.
l can't wait for someone else to die
locked up in a fucking room.
l can't, l can't do it.
You're dangerously close
to heart failure, Paul.
You might die a lot sooner
than you think.
Let me ask you something.
And l want you to be really
honest with me, okay?
lf l stay, will l be saved?
l can't guarantee it.
But if you don't come back
to the hospital,
you're condemning yourself
to a terrible death.
Your heart won't work anymore.
You'll die, asphyxiated -
lt's an awful death, Paul.
You can't imagine it.
At least here, we could help you.
You can help me die better.
That's what you're saying.
You can help me die better.
well, l'm not gonna do that. Okay?
l'd rather die outside.
l'm not gonna do it again.
How much did the lawyer charge?
Marianne.
How much did the fucking
lawyer charge?
Enough.
How much is enough, Marianne?
Enough so your children can
remember your fuckin' face.
You keep asking stupid questions
l'm gettin' out at the next corner.
Hey, guys, we are in home.
Daddy...
what did you bring us?
l brought you a kiss.
You didn't bring me a present, huh?
l brought you a kiss.
we made you a cake.
Thank you, sweetheart.
Freddy put the icing on it.
Freddy, are you going to say hello
to your father?
Freddy drew those for you.
l drew those ones.
Mommy made the cake.
Come here.
Come look at the cake, Daddy.
C'mon, Daddy.
There is a number hidden
in every act of life,
in every aspect of the universe.
There's fractals, matter, there,
there's a number screaming
to tell us something.
Am l boring you?
No. No.
l guess l try to tell them
that numbers are a door
to understanding a mystery
that's bigger than us.
How two people, strangers,
come to meet.
There's a poem by a Venezuelan writer
that begins ''The earth turned
to bring us closer;
it turned on itself and in us
until it finally brought us together
in this dream.''
That's beautiful.
There are so many things that have
to happen for two people to meet.
well, anyway, that's,
that's what mathematics are.
How long have you been swimming?
Oh, for years.
lt doesn't bore you?
No. No,
it's what makes me feel normal.
lf l didn't swim or walk or do
something, l think l'd go crazy.
Thanks for lunch.
Bye.
Do you want to come in?
No.
Thanks. Yes, l do want to come in.
Hey, can l ask you something.
Huh?
Okay, l have a gun.
Okay?
Don't look at me. Don't look at me.
Don't look at me.

No, l don't have any money.
Turn around, l'll shoot you.
Turn around. Turn around. Go.

Put, put 'em up. Put your hands up.

C'mon. Keep walkin'.
Go right down here.

Turn, turn around.

And take off your shoes.

Just get, get down on your knees.
Get down on your knees!
Please.
You shouldn't have done it.
Done what?
You shouldn't have done it!
Close your,...

She looked me in the eyes.
what are you talking about?
One of the girls l killed.
She looked at me in the eye.
She wanted to tell me something.
l ran away. l ran away.
l ran away. l ran away.
You sticking with red?
Sure.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
l, uh, ... Sorry, l had a dizzy.-
Can l get you a glass of
water or something?
l think l should go home.
l'm sorry, l just. -

lt's been a long time since
l liked someone so much.
Can l see you again?
l'm a married woman.

Thanks.
Good bye.

l got peace like a river,
l got peace like a river in my soul.
Everybody.
l've got love like an ocean,
l've got love like an ocean,
l've got love like an ocean
in my soul.
l've got joy like a fountain,
l've got joy like a fountain,
l've got joy like a fountain
in my soul -
Look, Daddy. these are the zebras,
these are the lions.
Very pretty, Gina.
How can you draw a zoo
if you've never been to one?
l've seen them in...
Stop fighting.
The lawyer called you to remind you
you have to go sign on Monday.
lf you want l'll go with you
to the church again?
Daddy, in school they said
you killed two girls and their Daddy.
ls that true?
Yes. No.
Yes.
He killed them.
lt was an accident...sweetie.
Understand?
Oh, Jesus, every time
l look at my children...
Hello.
Hello?
Paul?

Cristina.
Did l wake you?
Hang on a second.
Hi.
Did l wake you?
No, that's okay.
Um, can, can you come to my house?
ls something wrong?
No, l just...
l just want you to come if you can.
lf you want to.
Yeah. l'll be right there.
Thanks.
Okay.
lt's two o'clock in the morning.
who are you talking to?
l won't be long.
where are you going?
l said l won't be long.
Exactly where and
with who are you going?
l thought you'd change
after the transplant.
l thought you'd change
if you got pregnant.
But look, neither of us changed.
what's wrong?
He's been shot in the chest, okay?
Fast.
C'mon.
Shot...in the chest.
He's been shot in the chest.
C'mon.
Okay, how long has he been like that?
Oh, he's dying, okay - we need a doc -
Okay. l'll go get a stretcher.
Ma'am, he'll, he'll be right back.
Baby. lt's okay. Just hang in there,
l shot him.
l don't have the gun.
what?
l shot him.
Patrol, l need you to call the police.
lt's an emergency, yes.
l'm right out front.
Hi.
Are you okay?
You kept me thinking all day.
You see, l haven't spoken to anyone
in months,
and, uh, l barely know you and, uh,
l already need to talk to you.
And there's something, the more l
think about, the less l understand.
why the hell did you tell me that
you liked me?
Answer me, because l didn't like you
saying that at all.
You can't just walk up to a woman you
barely know and tell her you like her.
You, you can't. You can't do that.
You don't know
what she's going through.
Or what she's feeling.
l'm not married.
l -
lt's okay.
l'm sorry.
No.
wait. Cristina.
Kiss me. Please. Kiss me.
Cristina!
l have Michael's heart.
what?
l have Michael's heart.
You understand what l'm saying?
lt was transplanted into me at St.
Francis Hospital on October eleventh.
No.
l tried to tell you. l just didn't
know how to tell you.
How dare you?
How dare you?
How fucking dare you?
l'm here for a reason.
Get out of my house!
Don't touch me.
Get out of my house now!
You make me sick. You fuck!
There's a reason. Can't you see that?
You get out of my fucking -
Get the fuck out of my house!
You make me sick!
Get out!
Good morning.
why did you look for me?
Because l needed to.
l don't want your fucking pity.
That wasn't it.
l was sick, Cristina.
l was very sick.
l was dying.
And Michael gave me his heart.
He saved my life.
l tried in every way l knew
how to find out
who had given me his heart.
And that's how l found out who it was
and how he and your daughters had died.
And it was very painful for me
to know how l got his heart.
l couldn't sleep.
l just, l wanted to thank you.
l wanted to help in some way.
l just wanted to thank you for...
l couldn't find you.
And then l saw you...
that day.
And now l can't be away from you.
l can't.
You don't have to be afraid.
l've got a good heart.
l'm scared, too.
why did you leave us, Jack? why?
l'm where l have to be.
Gina got really sick
because of the hamster.
The past is like the Atlantic Ocean.
Back when l was me.
But the decisions l made -
that's my mirror.
That's my mirror.
And l have to live with them alone.
Alone.
And l can't erase it.
No one can erase it.
we need to stabilize him before
we can get him to the hospital.
But right now what we really need
are units of B-positive blood.
l'm O-positive, will that work?
Okay, open and close your
fist several times.
Okay, pal.
You're free to go for lack
of evidence.
The story doesn't check out and
contradicts our investigation
and statements made by Mrs. Peck
and Mr. Rivers.
l just need you to sign here.
But what if l really am guilty?
Hey, well, y'know, it happens.
won't be the first time,
won't be the last.
what are you doing?
You've been lost for too many days,
don't you think, you prick?
Mary, l don't want to fight.
l want this to end well.
Oh, you think ending well means
disappearing for a few days?
You just waited 'til you got better
to tell me to fuck off.
l'm going back to London.
l can't keep doing this.
Really?
l'll have surgery and l'll be
inseminated with your child,
with or without you.
Mary, what for? why?
Because l want to.
well, l won't authorize it.
Oh, no?
No.
well, you already have.
l have a signed copy of your
authorization to use your semen.
would you excuse me?
what do you gain?
l get what l want.
what do you gain?
You decide if you come looking
for me or not.
Hi, honey, l'm on my way home.
lf you need me to pick up anything
along the way - Girls, no!
Don't touch it. Laura, stop it.
Gimme a call on my cell.
l'll see you in a bit. Bye.
Hi, honey, l'm on my way home.
lf you need me to pick up anything
along the way - Girls, no!
Don't touch it. Laura, stop it.
Give me a call on my cell.
See you in a bit. Bye.
l'm grilling some chicken.
You want anything to eat?
No, thanks.
l can make you a sandwich,
if you - No, no,...
Cristina, no!
Listen to me.
You don't need that shit.
You, you don't need it.
Don't tell me what l need.
Katie could have lived.
She'd be alive right now if that
bastard hadn't left her there...
lying in the street.
He left the three of them
like animals.
He didn't care.
She could be here with me.
That sonofabitch
is walking the streets,
and l can't even go into their room.
what do you mean,
he's walking the street?
l want to kill him.
You want to kill him?
l'm gonna kill Jack Jordan.
l'm gonna kill that sonofabitch.
Slow down. wait. Just, just slow down.
Slow down. Slow down while l what?
Huh? while l what?
Take it easy.
Take it easy?
My husband and
my little girls are dead,
and l'm supposed to take it
fucking easy?
l can't just go on with my life.
l am paralyzed here.
l am a fucking amputee,
do you see that?
who are you? You owe it to Michael -
No, you've got his heart.
You're in his house fucking his wife
and sitting in his chair.
we have to kill him. - No, wait!
Not like this. Not like this.
Then how? Tell me how?
Katie died with red shoelaces on.
She hated red shoelaces.
And she kept asking me to get her
some blue ones
and l never got her the blue ones.
She was wearing the fucking red
shoelaces when she was killed.
You shouldn't have done it!
Close your - close your goddam eyes.
You...
murderer. You just let them lie there
in the street.
The two little girls,
you just let 'em die like dogs.
l should've killed you.
Now you disappear. Don't even go to
the motel for your things.
Just disappear.
Mrs. Peck.
How is he?
we weren't able to use your blood
for his transfusion.
we found very high levels of
illegal substances in your blood.
You're taking very high risks, y'know.
well, that's my problem, isn't it?
ln your state, l suggest you stop
using these substances.
what are you talking about?
You're pregnant, Mrs. Peck.
You're sure.
You really need to start taking care
of yourself, Mrs. Peck.
we'll let you know when Mr. Rivers
is out of the O.R.
where were you?
Did you kill him?
Did you?
why didn't you wake me up?
where's the body?
Nobody'll ever find the body.
l'm sorry.
we're gonna go home now.
Let's just get out of here, okay?
Yeah?
You okay? You okay, baby?
Just lie down.
Rest. l just need to rest.
l know. l know.
l'm sorry.
l love you.
l love you. l love you.
Oh, God.

There's somebody outside.
Oh, my God.
You want to kill me?
what's he doing here?
Here l am.
Shoot me.
Shoot me.
Oh, no, baby. Oh, no.
Oh, my God. Baby.
Oh, my God.
Baby.
Baby, baby,...
Oh, God.
Call an ambulance.
Call a fucking ambulance.

Everyone.
And how much fits
into twenty-one grams?
How much is lost?
when do we lose twenty-one grams?
How much goes with them?
How much is gained?
How much is gained?
Twenty-one grams.
The weight of a stack

The weight of a humming bird.
A chocolate bar.
How much do twenty one grams weigh?
