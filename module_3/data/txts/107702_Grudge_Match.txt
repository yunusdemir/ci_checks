Grugde Match - 2013
Hello again everybody,
I'm Jim Lampley.
Certain athletes are born enemies.
Bird and Magic,
Ali and Frazier,
Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding,
but the fiercest rivalry was
between two fighters from Pittsburgh
with the names Razor and Kid.
<i>1982, Pittsburgh. Razor and Kid,</i>
<i>both undefeated top rank contenders,
divide the city in a spectacular war.</i>
<i>The brutal 15-round bout</i>
<i>is still considered one of
the greatest fights of the '80s.</i>
<i>Kid and Razor quickly rose to superstardome</i>
<i>and the man who
he took a large percentage...</i>
<i>was the late fight impressario,
Dante Slate.</i>
My motto is to fight in the ring
and stay with the bling.
That makes me royalty...
<i>Friends do not look at the
camera, look at me.</i>
Yes, but I think it is better
if I'm connected with people.
<i>Yes, I really do not think...</i>
What the people there?
<i>As the world calling for a rematch...</i>
<i>They said
return to the ring for another fight.</i>
<i>rematch was transmitted by
TV and had a large audience.</i>
<i>But this time was different.
Reason and Kid defeated...</i>
<i>had a victory it's over in 4 rounds.</i>
<i>That made both fighters obtain millions.</i>
<i>But then an announcement
shocked the world.</i>
I am announcing my retirement
Professional box.
I will have my revenge, damn!
Razor you hear me?
I will have my revenge damn!
Something we have not seen today.
And sadly like many
professional athletes...
He lost his fortune
a few years after his retirement.
Razor again Pennsylvania in 1987...
To work as it did before.
Moreover, Kid became a Pitsman.
It became a jockey, to wear jackets.
<i>Today, in charge of a popular
restaurant in Pittsburg.</i>
<i>Who would have imagined that
anniversary in her 30s...</i>
<i>The fight would never happen.</i>
<i>They will continue another year being avoided,
making the fight never happens...</i>
<i>never return.</i>
Only one thing.
I never wore jackets.
The guy is lying.
- Walter, how you been?
- I've seen you on TV.
Do not look more television.
- They were talking about you and Kid.
- Who cares?
Are we friends because you do something?
żEnserio, want to know?
I never told him to
anyone this but...
I wanted to be a dancer.
You know, with all my skills.
I know a good thing when I see it.
No, seriously wise żpero
Razor was ambidextrous?
No, I did not. Yes, he could not
knock me out with either hand.
As you fell over and
again in that fight.
Thank you sir, why is
to see me here?
She is a lady with whom you are speaking.
Sure Joe? Because this type has
many balls to talk like that.
Idiot! It has been 30
years since those fights.
- You should get over it.
- I was young, I was very confident.
Not trained enough.
Sex was 16 times a week,
more training.
But do not worry sweetie you had
been safe.
Ha ha! They are a public good.
Lord will let me enter.
<i>No, impossible!</i>
Hey... what's up?
It has been locked up here and
the second time this week.
Let me see.
żLenny, am I wrong?
<i>degenerate out there, want
replace my gonorrhea.</i>
Do not say that, do not even know is
like a nice guy.
<i>! I want to give a sponge bath!
But not this time...</i>
<i>takes too long and
he spends much wiping...</i>
<i>special time in my area, if
is that you know what I mean.</i>
<i>like I've never bathed.</i>
- I'm just doing my job.
- I know.
<i>If... that's what they all say.</i>
Sir, we have already had
this conversation before.
I appreciate this, but this
going through a bad time
Sorry, we have to make
different things.
Right.
No problem. Wait let me back up.

You know you're the only one I ever
did anything wrong.
Do not change the subject,
'm still mad at you.
żMolesto me? If you were
30 years ago would leave there.
We had so much on the table.
Why did you have to go?
We would be sitting in tubs now with a

If... you can not swim,
probably drown you.
On that note I leave there.
Tell them I want my two
sleeping pills.
- It's 10 in the morning!
- I do not care!
I want to dream about all prostitutes

Lower the window.
What a miracle, man. I wanted to surprise you.
- Really?
Oh come on, Razor.
Dante Jr. Do not tell me that there will be
one like me.
Too bad your father did not appear
to take what was left of my money.
- Papa died last year.
I would not trust that if I did not see it die.
It was.
Do not feel bad.
I would love to talk to you Razor.
You look good!
This is a good area.
żAtunes?
żPlátanos that are being black?
You sound like my idol.
Not a very good choice, I like
more fish.
Is that fish? Sushi fish is that...
That's another thing.
Check the can, plus it does not cost much
What is this? Zun mouse or something?
- It's a dog.
- Zun dog?
A dog... Then why are you here?
żPorque am I here? You know what this is?
- Zuna bad movie?
- It's a video game.
Exactly what you can not remember?
Captain America, remembering not want to be
about something that already happened.
That is original.
Let Razor who made this game
saw an HBO special.
They loved it, I loved it myself.
Because it really was.
Whatever they want to put you and Kid
in the game. OK?
Thus, only what we do
burn is thrown a few punches.
With some clear voice, making sounds.
Something clearly much fear, that's
everything.
It's simple, I can not be in the same
such place, can not.
Ok, ok hear goes slower,
So I bring you something else.
You talk about a few hours per 10 thousand
dollars.
$ 10,000, friend, easy.
No, not worth it.
How'd that not worth it?
I'm watching your house.
Yes, of course you do well, you think your
mouse will earn more money?
It is a dog and I do not do it by
money.
Tell you what, do it for the fans.

but I can not stand that guy.
What the matter?
You got something against all?
