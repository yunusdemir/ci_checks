Take a sample of her blood
Then get rid of her
Yes, sir
The Umbrella Corporation thought
they contained the infection.
They were wrong.
Racoon City was just the beginning
Within weeks, the T-Virus
had consumed the United States.
Within months, the world
The virus didn't just wiped out human life...
...lakes and rivers dried out.
Forests became deserts.
And whole continents were reduced to
nothing  more than baren wastelands.
Slowly but surely.
The Earth began to wither and die.
The few survivors that were, l
earnt to keep on the move.
We avoided major cities.
If we stopped in a place too long,
they would be drawn to us
Only a few at first, but then more and more...
A never ending army...
... of the undead.
For those of us left, staying on the road,
seemed the only way to stay alive.
This is KLKB We have 7 people here
in need of urgent medical attention
We need help. This is KLKB.
Can anyone hear us?
Can anyone help us? Please?
My baby
Please!
Please it save my baby!
You bitch!
You dropped my baby.
We're surrounded
We needed help. Can anyone hear us?
Can anyone help us?
Please!
Let us see.
What you got down there, missy?
I wouldn't do that!
That he happens to you.
Pull her back!
You show her, daddy
Daddy, daddy!
Jesus Christ, he's dead.
Think you're pretty smart, huh?
We will see
There you go, bitch!
We will see what you can do.
Open the cage!
I am scared!
Let them loose.
That.
That was a juicy one, huh?
#In a gadada vida
#Don't you know that I love you
#In a gadada vida, baby
#Don't you know that I'll always be true
Hey Carlos, this is Claire.
You got any smokes?
No!
Like I'm supposed to believe that.
Claire, Would I lie to you?
LJ?
How can I help you?
Got any smokes?
No can't do.
What about alternates?
Sorry to say...
... we're all out of that too.
You gotta be shitting me?
Sorry campus,
...smoked the last two back in Salt Lake.
Yeah, people.
Damn it!
...end of the world.
Anyone else?
Paris facility. Food supplies now at 50%
6 casualties. Biohazard numbers increasing
London facility.
Food supplies down to 28%.
17 casualties. Biohazard numbers increasing.
Gentlemen!
Dr. Isaacs.
How good of the science division to join us.
General Wesker
As one is
On the subject of the biohazards,
what does the science division have to report?
Well we now know conclusively that
they have no real need for sustenance
They hunger for flesh, but do not require it
My investigations indicates that
they'll remain active for decades
- We'll be trapped underground for decades?
What news of project Alice?
Using antibodies from her blood
I will develop a serum that will not just
combat the effects of the T-Virus,
...but potentially reverse it.
Giving back these creatures a measure
of their intelligence.
Their memories.
Thus curving down their hunger for flesh.
You're confident you can domesticate them?
They are animals essentially.
We can train them.
If we can take away their basic instincts
They'll never be human...
...but would provide the basis for
a docile work force.
We can return to the surface.
After months of experiments,
...you have got nothing to show.
And we are left over underground.
Without the original Project Alice,
progress has been difficult.
I've been forced to replicate her
using flawed genetic models.
The results are unpredictable.
Project Alice and the subject
of domestication...
...is of the highest priority.
You'll concentrate on this
and exclude all other research.
I expect and updated report within a week.
Simply demanding results
will not guarantee them.
Then perhaps we should get someone else in charge
Someone who can give us the
reassurances we require.
Continue with your research, Doctor.
While it is still your research.
This meeting is adjourned.
Sorry about this, Stevie!
This is Claire Redfield convoy,
present location at the Desert Trout Motel...
Broadcasting for any survivors.
Is there anybody in there?
Broadcasting for any survivors.
Is there anybody in there?
Seems quiet.
Don't they always
Claire, it looks clear. We're going in.
It's your call, boys
Come on!
Let's do it.
Get me a room
I'll take a water bed and Jacuzzi.
Then I'm going to rent me a porno.
What happened? Are you ok?
Yeah, it's all clear.
Somebody need my help?
It's nothing, but if you insist...
That's right. So sit back and relax
Spread out, look for anything of use
Gas, food, ammo
You know the drill
You like playing rough, huh?
Oh, I've had worse
I'm sure
You've always been gentle with me, babe.
Oh God!
I'm leaving.
So, what do you say,
a dinner at my place, tonight?
Oh, I'm there.
This is amazing. He knows what it is.
A camera.
You try.
Stand your ground.
Very good.
Unbelievable!
He has memory, and reasoning skills.
-This is incredible!
The serum works.
You've domesticated them.
You've done it. Congratulations!
For the love of Jesus!
Pork and beans and some peaches there!
The suspense!
You. Cat food.
Just kidding. It's pork and beans.
Hey!
It is sufficient?
Soup.
Cream of mushrooms.
Yeah sure.
I'll be dammed!
How do you do that?
Just one of my skills.
It's a dying art, unfortunatelly.
This is the last one.
Some kind of fruit.
Sorry that.
Have you checked the gas station yet?
Yeah, it's bone dry.
How are we looking here?
Well, Claire, if we can run these trucks on rust,
...we're looking pretty good.
All right!
Hey sweetheart!
Are we up yet?
It's almost done.
Who's out there?
Hey, Carlos!
Claire?
All that working is slowing you down.
I want the perimeter up.
Last sentinel in place.
Perimeter is up and running.
All motion sensors online.
Cameras 100%.
Refried beans, fruit salad.
Bueno.
Storm's coming. Let's start packing it up
and move inside.
Get on the bus.
Put this fire out.
This is Claire Redfield convoy.
Present location the Desert Trout Motel.
FLY OVER THERE
Heard the tranmissions again.
They're broadcasting from some town in Alaska
No infection. No Undead. They're isolated
Go To Alaska.
Activate number 87.
Shit!
Dr.Isaac!
What is it?
My sensors have detected a peak
is psy-organic activity.
Both alpha and beta waves.
From number 87?
No, activity is not from one of the clones.
It appeared outside the complex.
It's not possible.
My sensors are quite clear.
Massive psy-organic activity was
detected 15 minutes ago.
Sent it on the  desert location
Claire!
Oh God!
Carlos!
I see them.
Everybody, stay in your trucks.
What is going on?
Everybody, stay in your trucks.
Roll up your windows and keep quiet.
Close the windows up.
What's wrong with their eyes!?
They're feeding on infected flesh.
Fire it up, let's get out of here.
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Lock and load.
It's stuck.
Oh, hell no. Let's get out of here.
Let's get on the bus, come on.
Go! Go!
All raise.
Claire!
Damn it!
Wait, Carlos, we have to evacuate the bus.
You got it.
Come on. Go Go Go!!
Come on!
Now, Betty, go
Go go go!
Go!
Hurry up!
Betty!
No!
Betty!
Go go go!
Dr Isaacs!
Another spike of abnormal activity
has been detected.
45% of probabilities that this is
Project Alice.
Triangulate, find the location.
Impressive!
If it is her, her development
is extraordinary.
Her powers seem to have grown
in a geometric rate.
since her escapre from the DTork facility.
You've made 10 trips to the surface
in the last 24 hours.
All unauthorized.
Any trips to the surface, specially to gather
fresh specimen, puts my men at risk.
Why did you disobeyed orders, sir?
Isaacs!
My research has intensified.
Don't worry, they're perfectly secured.
You're supposed to be domesticating them.
Sometimes aggression has its uses.
What could you possibly needs these things for?
Dr. Isaacs!
Specimen 87 has reached the final state
of the test grid.
Perfect, put her on the screen.
Good girl.
That it is what tries.
He knows what he needs to know.
I do not understand your remark.
My research will change the face of everything.
When you pick a side.
Choose the right one.
Hi!
Hey!
This belongs to you?
Gave it to you last night.
For luck.
Thank you.
What's your name?
K Mart.
It's where they found me.
Claire and the others.
A few years back.
You have another name?
Never liked it.
And everybody I knew is dead.
Seemed like time for a change.
Anyone wants to say something?
Alice, this is Claire Redfield.
She's the one that put this convoy together.
Thank you so much for your help.
Claire!
Excuse me, something needs my attention.
Last six months we all signed up
for the convoy.
Pretty soon there'll be more of us
dead than alive.
Alice, what happened to you?
Why did you leave after DTroy?
I didn't have a choice.
They were looking for me.
What do you mean?
They were tracking me.
I couldn't be around you,
any of you.
I would have got you all killed.
That's why you disappeared?
Broke into an Umbrella facility,..
...hacked into their computers.
Downloaded satellite trajectories.
Stayed off the grid.
After the world ended,
why stay out on your own?
It's safer if I don't go around people.
But you've come back!
Damn!
What time is it?
Chase,
What time is it?
Carlos, it is 12:14
Why, is there somewhere you've
got to be?
I guess I must be moving on.
Welcome home.
Got a minute?
Yeah.
Everyone is grateful to you for helping us out.
How long am I gon'na stay?
Don't get me wrong.
We are grateful.
They're all talking about what you did...
...and they are scared.
I don't blame them.
People have a hammered in
getting rid of me.
Not just you.
You're positive it's her?
62%, to great a chance to pass up.
If it is Project Alice, she's been evading
the satellite grid for years.
I've rerouted the remaining satellites...
...to reaquire the subject and
she'll be unaware of us.
I'll have an strike team ready within the hour.
No, we'll establish a positive
identification first.
100%
The group she's with includes
known associates.
The original Project Alice
is vital to my research.
The whole process of domestication is in her blood.
Her genetic structure is the key.
The longer we leave her out there
the greater the chance we lose her again
I can't risk that.
That decision isn't yours to make.
You'll take no action until this matter
has been discussed by the committee
at the next scheduled meeting.
Doctor!
That's an order!
Claire, these are sequence of tranmissions.
It's the best indications of what we...
Alaska!?
We have to check it out.
We can't just ignore it.
Have you any idea what kind
of journey that would be?
Yeah, a long one.
And at the end of it, what? You have
no guarantee there is even anyone alive up there.
Claire, these transmissions say...
They are dated six months ago.
How many radio broadcasts have be
responded to?
How many times have we got there?
The transmissions say there is
no infection up there
It's isolated.
It is safe.
This convoy trust me with their lives.
These people don't need pipe dreams.
May be that's exactly what they need.
Look at them.
Six months ago, there were 50 of us
then 40.
Now there is less than 30.
We're starting to give up.
They need somekind of hope.
We made a decision to make.
And too big!
It's too important for me to make it for you.
There is a change
there are survivors.
In Alaska.
There is a chance...
...that the infection hasn't reached that far.
But we don't know for sure.
So we have a choice.
We stay as we are...
...or we travel to Alaska.
For Alaska?
We will leave soon.
I hope you're right.
The food is virtually gone
Trucks are running on empty.
I've got half a tank of gas
That's it. Chase?
Shit, I don't even have empty.
I have enough for 100 miles.
All right, if we're going to make this trip,
we're going to need to resupply.
Yeah!
These are our options.
The nearest safest bet is,
right there.
It's empty, I tried there.
Then we...
We could try this.
Vegas.
We're limping and we're short
in gasoline and supplies.
Vegas is too damn dangerous.
Place is going to be crawling with
the sons of bitches.
We have traveled every small town
for the last the 6 months.
We have to go to the big city.
She is right.
Vegas is our only bet.
We'll establish a positive
identification first.
"One hundred percent."
"Doctor that's an order."
"The Committee authorizes immediate action."
"Release of vehicles and personnel."
"Under the commando of the Dr Isaacs."
"That's an order."
PEACE OVER THERE, LIVING OUTSIDE
CAREFREE
STILL PEOPLE,
LIVING, LOVING PEOPLE
Hey, are you all right?
Yeah, I am fine.
The pork and beans, man.
I don't see how them cowboys do it.
Just practice.
WELCOME To Fantastic
LAS VEGAS
Oh, my God!
What happened to it?
The desert must have taken it back.
Five years.
It put the sand back.
It's empty.
No undead, nothing.
Those birds must've  move the city block by block.
Picked it clean.
I don't see any truck stops.
Where are they?
There, lower parking at the casino up ahead
There's gas pumps there.
How in the hell do you know that?
I dump 2Gs back in the day.
You lost 2000 dollars?
Damn it!
Spread them out.
We're going to have to move that.
Casey, we need a look out.
Up there.
Great.
Climbing the Eiffel Tower. My God.
A few years ago
that'd have caused a stir.
Well, let the good times roll.
Let's get this done.
And get the hell out of here.
Mikey, get the wench.
Yeah.
Carlos!
Move away.
Get back.
Just get in the back and stay quiet.
Go now, go!
It backs down
She really is magnificent!
When she is dead,
make sure you move in fast.
We need a sample of her blood
while it is still warm.
That might be a problem.
Satellite in position?
Yes, sir.
Then shut her down.
Mikey!
Mikey!
She's fighting the conditioning.
Boost the control signal.
Help me, Chase!
Climb!
What is it?
The satellite, somekind of malfunction.
How long?
Feed coming online in 15 seconds.
3,2 now!
Where is she going?
Shut her down!
She's still coming!
Now!
Oh shit!
Back to base.
The antivirus.
Get me the antivirus.
Why didn't you shoot?
Because if we're going to get to Alaska,
...we need that helicopter intact.
Let's go look in the computer,
see where that helicopter is headed.
How is he?
Under house arrest, as you instructed.
He's been quiet.
How much of this have you used?
The blood increases the creatures power.
Also increases the strength of the infection.
I needed it.
You have no idea
what this will do to you.
No!
I have an idea.
You're out of control.
Under execute order 1345 issued by Chancellor
for insubordination and gross misconduct in the field...
...I sentence you to summary liquidation.
Liquidation?
No, just die.
Take the body to the surface,then
bring me the stats on Project Alice to see what...
Sir!
Good thing we like a challenge.
Hold on!
They have the antivirus in there.
Just hold on.
It is too late and you know it.
Besides, you need a way to get in there.
And I have an idea.
You keep them safe, huh!
Got it.
Come here.
Carlos.
Save it.
You just promise me one day...
...When you get down there...
...consider it done.
I wish I had a smoke.
I'll be damned.
LJ sneaky son of a bitch.
All down.
Quickly, go.
Take it.
You're not coming?
Take care of the others.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.
I am an artificial intelligence.
I know what you are.
I knew your sister.
She was a homicidal bitch.
My sister computer was merely following the most
logical path for the preservation of the human life.
Yeah!
Kill a few, save a lot!
So, what happened here?
The Dr. Isaacs returned in
an infected state.
He was bitten by a creature that been
treated with a newly developed serum.
A serum derived from your blood.
The resulting infection has caused massive change.
My blood?
Your blood has bonded with the T-Virus.
The Dr Isaacs correctly deduced that it
could be used to destroy the biohazards for good.
You mean that my
blood is the cure for all this.
Correct.
So why are you helping me?
Your blood is pure. And this facility has
all you'd require to synthesize a cure.
You mean that this could all end!
Correct.
There is, however,...
...a faux paux.
I have contained him to the lower levels,
but I cannot hold him there for much longer.
Let's go.
Alice!
Good luck!
You can't kill me.
Yeah!
I've told you.
I cannot die.
For so long, I thought you were the future.
It was wrong.
I am the future!
No!
You're just another asshole!
And we're both going to die down here.
Yeah, you're the future all right.
All attempts to contact the
North American facility have failed.
How long have they been off the air?
17 hours.
We must consider them lost.
The plans remain unchanged.
All data will be transferred to this facility.
All research will continue under my
personal supervision.
I expect results within 1 month.
You' won't have to wait that long, boys!
Because I'm coming for you.
and I'm going to be bringing
a few of my friends.
