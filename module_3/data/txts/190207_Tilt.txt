I'm pretty sure
I called him.
- Don't forget the mail.
- Yeah.
Hey, Charlie.
Hi, buddy, did you miss us?
That driver could not have
been more than 15-years-old.
Who gets lost in
the airport?
Be nice.
I love it.
The only one who calls me is
my trusty Spanish robo <i>amigo.</i>
There.
Operation Immediate Unpacking
is complete.
My hero.
Hmm. I'm starving.
Should we order something?
Like Mexican, or Thai?
I think I gained
like ten pounds in Hawaii.
Can we do something light?
I think there's some
chicken in the freezer.
If you go get us
some veggies,
I'll throw
something together.
Please?
What kind of veggies?
My hero.
It's like I feel like she's
not doing herself any favors
by publicly shaming him
into getting engaged.
The guy is such a moron,
I don't know
if he even gets it.
Come on, Joe.
He is.
He misspelt
the word "libertarian"
in his email to me.
I'm like, if you're gonna
be an asshole,
at least spell it right.
Oh, God.
Not everyone is as smart
as you are, Joe.
Ow! Fuck!
Ooh!
- Fuck!
- Oh, sweetie, are you all right?
Oh, that was totally my fault.
I'm so sorry.
Let me see.
Ooh!
Oh, jeez! Okay.
Let's get you cleaned up.
Ow. Did I mention ow?
<i>I'm not doing that to brag,</i>
<i>'cause you know what?
I don't have to brag.</i>
<i>I don't have to.
Believe it or not.</i>
<i>I'm doing that...</i>
That's a very mom color.
Shut up.
Kendra gave it to me.
Mm-hmm?
Very good.
<i>We need that thinking.</i>
<i>We have losers.
We have losers.</i>
<i>We have people that don't...</i>
Look at this orange jackass.
Listen up, little buddy.
That fat, crazy,
piss-haired man
is gonna be your
first President.
You're scaring our baby.
<i>The American Dream</i>
<i>is dead.</i>
Give it up, Donald.
The day of the blustering,
angry white man is over.
<i>When I get elected President,
I will bring...</i>
Joe, put that away.
Go to bed.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just a second.
Oh.
Don't forget,
my sister is coming
to drop Sebastian off
in a couple of weeks.
He's gonna stay with us
for a few days.
It'll be a little test run.
Sounds good.
What is that?
Too beefy to be a rat.
Possum?
Be gone, beast.
Oh. Sorry, Charlie.
Not you.
<i>In order to have
a proper appreciation</i>
<i>of the American
economic system,</i>
<i>we must know how
the national income is divided</i>
<i>in America.</i>
<i>Is the distribution widespread?</i>
<i>Or is the wealth of America</i>
<i>concentrated in
the hands of a few,</i>
<i>as the socialists and
communists say?</i>
<i>The answer constitutes
of tribute to our system.</i>
<i>For the wealth produced
within American capitalism</i>
<i>is widely distributed
throughout our population,</i>
<i>as we shall see.</i>
Such a statement,
dubious even for 1955,
would be considered
laughably ignorant today.
Even in the mythical
Golden Age
of the American mid-century,
any semblance of
economic parity and prosperity
should more accurately
be described
as an aberration,
not a validation
of American capitalism.
Many of the factors that
led to the post-war boom,
proved to be mere blips.
From the 1970's onwards,
the income inequality that defined
the first half of the 20th century
has returned
with a vengeance.
And there is no evidence
that the good old days
are coming back.
Delivery.
God, this thing is a monster.
Do we really need to
set it up now?
Seven months early?
I wanna see how big it is,
how it'll fit in the nursery.
Look, even the cartoon guy
in the diagram looks miserable.
I feel you, buddy.
<i>The problem

Hey, you losers!
Jesus Christ!
You scared the shit out of me.
I'm sorry.
I just couldn't resist.
Where'd you get this thing?
It's grotesque.
The Internets, of course.
You're just getting home?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, my God.
Today was a disaster.
Two of the other nurses
called in sick.
- Did you eat yet?
- Mm-mm.
I can make you a grilled
cheese a-la-Joseph.
I'll take anything
a-la-Joseph.
We don't have
any bread, though.
Oh.
Hi. Yeah, uh,
like I said to the other guy,
I recently added
phone service
to our cable package
and the rate I was given
was $129 a month.
But I received our bill
and it says $159 a month.
So I was just wondering...
Yeah, okay.
Three months trial period.
Okay.
Uh, is there a cheaper bundle
that I can sign up for?
No, that would be
more expensive.
Yeah.
All right. You know what?
Never mind.
No, thank you.
All right. Thank you.
Bye.
Come on.
I'm doing amazing
in Iowa.
I'm crushing it
in New Hampshire.
Jeb Bush is a loser.
Lindsey Graham has
a woman's name.
And I'm gonna build an
amazing wall around Canada.
Oh, my God.
You should have seen Joe's face
when I jumped out with that.
It's scary.
Okay.
Here's the moment you've
all been waiting for.
I know.
- Oh, my God.
- Wow.
Oh, my God. Look at
this perfect little angel.
I know. I could
stare at it all day.
Joe, this little
fella has your eyes.
No, it doesn't really
have eyes yet, does it?
"It"?
A toast...
to...
Team Jojo and
Little JoJo Junior.
Thank you.
Cheers.
I love you guys.
- Wow! Nice.
- Yummy!
Mm!
- Great.
- Mm. Jo!
Thank you.
Holy shit. Is...
Is that phone actually
from the 1990's?
Like, does it just
play rap-rock
straight from the phone?
Can you just play Limp Bizkit
from that phone?
- Andy!
- I just... I don't know.
- I've never seen...
- Jackass.
No, Joe made the sacrifice
of giving up his cell phone
so that we could
save money.
It... It was really not
much of a sacrifice.
I work from home, and the phone
was ultimately a distraction.
All I did was obsessively check
social media all day.
What are you... What are
you working on right now?
Well, since I had such
positive response with <i>Tilt,</i>
I decided I was gonna work
on another documentary.
I thought you were writing
a screenplay for some reason.
No. No, it's a documentary.
Uh, it's mainly about how
the American Dream, it...
Well, how the myth of
the American Dream
is actually antithetical to
the capitalist model.
So I focus on the post-war period
of the 50's and the early 60's.
This wok is amazing.
- Like, this, uh...
- Sorry, go ahead.
- No, it's fine.
- Actually could you put...
This time period that's
held up to be,
um, this Golden Age
of American life,
when in actuality...
- I'm just starting to realize now.
- I'm sorry.
- Can I help you?
- No, I got it.
So which, as we're learning
now with things like
- the Occupy movement.
- Andy, where are the diapers?
They're right
by the front door.
It's prosperity for
the few.
The people that are...
No, no, no.
Right by the door.
And they term the 1%...
That was fun.
You know, you could have
shown some more enthusiasm
about the sonogram.
You seemed like you couldn't
have been less interested.
Of course I'm interested.
I had already seen it.
You should have seen me
when I first saw it.
You haven't even started
setting up the crib.
It's still in the box.
Okay...
I'm sorry. I...
I'm feeling a little
stressed out now,
I'm working really long hours
on my documentary.
There's so much footage
to sort through.
Look, I don't wanna
have a competition,
because I hate that, but,
I'm stressed out.
I went into overtime at
the clinic this week again.
I'm behind in studying for
my MCATs.
I haven't even started some
of my med school applications.
Oh, and I'm pregnant.
I'm sorry, but I win.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
I'll step it up, okay?
I promise.
I'm... I'm really excited
about the baby.
All right?
Everything's gonna
be great.
How's he doing?
He's good.
Falling asleep.
Actually, do you think we could
slow down just a little bit?
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
We're almost home.
I think I'm allergic
to these flowers.
Will you take him?
I'm gonna get the other bag.
- Oh, no, I'll get it.
- No, I'll get it.
Hold the baby.
There you go.
<i>You were in a fight,
that's what you're talking.</i>
<i>But that boy,
that's my friend.</i>
Oh, my God!
This thing's a beast.
I can't get leverage. I think I
need to dig wider around it.
I don't want to rip up
more of the lawn.
Just keep churning it up.
'Cause see,
it's getting looser.
Here.
- Ow!
- Oh, my God!
- Fuck! Ow!
- Oh, sweetie! Are you okay?
- Fucking hell.
- Let me see.
Oh, my God!
Okay. Uh...
You fucking broke
my fingers.
Okay, we need to
get you to a hospital.
Um, don't move.
Just stay there.
Shit!
Okay, um...
Why don't you go
lie down,
and I'll make you
some food.
Are you hungry?
Maybe.
You should eat.
You want another one of these?
How's the pain?
It hurts.
Well...
The good news is you have full license
to hold this over me for, like,
as long as you want.
You can totally make me
your slave for five years.
Ten.
You sure it's okay?
Yeah.
I have three meetings this
morning and I'm already late.
Whoa.
Nice look.
Casual Monday?
What is that smell?
It stinks.
It's coming from outside.
Maybe something died
under the house.
Yeah, I think it's that critter that
was scratching around last week.
Oh, yeah. Well, you'll
investigate, won't you, slave?
I can think of nothing
I'd rather do more.
Be careful.
Don't get your
wiener bitten off.
Sound advice.
Thank you.
<i>What's he gotta say?</i>
<i>He specifically said that
he doesn't think you're gonna...</i>
<i>All his supporters
are gonna come...</i>
<i>Of course he's gonna say that.
What's he gonna say?</i>
<i>I mean...
I love it when they hit me.</i>
<i>Because so far as you know,</i>
<i>everybody up there
has gone down the tubes.</i>
<i>Okay? From Bush to this...
They've all gone down.</i>
<i>Also a lot of them
were out of the race.</i>
<i>Walter hit me,
he's gone.</i>
<i>You have Perry of Texas, right?</i>
<i>We have Lindsey Graham.
Everyone hit me.</i>
<i>Lindsey Graham was in five,</i>
<i>he's now at zero.</i>
<i>In South Carolina,
I'm at 32, he's at three.</i>
<i>And he's a sitting senator.
There's something wrong.</i>
<i>So I will tell you,</i>
<i>I'm ready to hit
whenever they hit.</i>
<i>I'm a counter-puncher.</i>
Mm.
It's good!
Mm. It's okay.
Oh, so I read
that bit of
voiceover narration
that you emailed me.
What'd you think?
It's good.
I mean, of course it's good.
It's very articulate
and everything.
Okay. But?
No "but". Nothing.
It just...
I thought this was
a documentary about
the military industrial
complex.
'Cause that's what you were researching
and talking about all last year.
Well, the subject is, uh...
It's expanded since then.
You know, it's evolved.
And all of these topics
are linked to this
false idea
of the American Golden Age.
This fictional time period
that idiot Conservatives
are always talking about
taking us back to,
when the fact is
it never even existed.
It's a myth
founded on, on greed, and...
And...
inequality and...
and all types of repression.
So war profiteering is
still part if the documentary,
but it's more about this idea
of the American Golden Age.
In fact, that's what I'm
gonna call it. <i>Golden Age.</i>
Okay. That...
That sounds very interesting.
It does.
I just don't know
how commercial it would be.
You know, you talk
about commercial.
I think something like this
could be a really big deal.
I mean, it's so timely.
It's so topical.
But it's also so, uh,
so subversive
that I think that it could
really cause like...
like a cultural disruption.
I'm sorry, babe.
I am really excited
to see what you
come up with.
<i>In the area of

One of the CIA's

<i>We will continue to
support a moderate opposition</i>
<i>that is essential for a
political resolution in Syria.</i>
<i>We will continue to be

The best...
and perhaps only argument
for American exceptionalism
is the sophistication of
its propaganda machinery.
This is not
the quaint tackiness
of "Dear Leader" North Korea,
or "Beloved Father"
Stalinist Russia.
This is propaganda
at its most
evolved.
The kind that convinces
its subjects
that it is anti-propaganda.
That it is in fact
reason.
The kind that makes you feel
not as if it was imposed
upon you, but rather
as if you chose it.
- Amazing spot, right?
- Yeah.
First time in the area?
Is it that obvious?
But, yeah. I, uh...
I'm just in Burbank for
a conference for a few days,
and I had...
an afternoon free, and...
I'm a sucker for
a good view.
Where are you from?
New Mexico.
- Albuquerque.
- Okay.
Some pretty good
views there.
Yeah.
You want me to take
one with you in it?
Sure. That'd be great.
If you don't mind.
No, of course not.
Oh. You know what? Here.
Take it with this.
I'm gonna email this
to my wife.
Make her jealous.
Okay, that's good, but...
I think maybe
if you step
behind that rock,
I can get the city
in the background.
Okay, sure. Sure.
Okay.
Okay, good.
Hold right there.
Smile.
Right.
Okay, good.
Take one more.
Oh, your eyes are closed
on this one.
Okay, last one.
Okay.
That's a fancy gizmo
you got here.
Are you sure you don't want
me to take one with this?
No.
No, that's okay.
- No?
- No, no, thank you.
No.
No.
That's okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hey.
- Oh. Uh...
- Don't forget this.
Yes, thank you.
If you're a sucker
for a good view,

Yeah. Well, see you.

Hey, did you call that guy
at my mom's agency
about an interview?
Uh...
Yeah, I got her message
the other day.
What did... Did you talk
to her or something?
Well, yes.
Is that a problem?
It's... It's a good lead.
A lot of people would
kill for an in like that.
That's depressing.
Sorry, I thought you were
interested in the job.
You seemed really excited
about it
when we were all
at dinner last month.
I was being polite.
I was totally put on the spot.
What was I supposed to say?
You know, for me
to get a day job
right now would be
a huge setback.
It's really not something to
just casually ambush me about
in front of your parents.
Joe, this is a good job.
An Assisting Editor
at a branding company?
I'm a filmmaker.
It's humiliating.
It's stable.
And it has a good salary
and insurance,
and you could
move up the ladder.
Yeah. Great.
To cash in my chips to work
editing boner pills commercials
for my mother-in-law?
So I can what? So I can have
a cell phone and a car again?
Okay, please don't
do this.
Please don't make me
the person who is
forcing you to give up
on your dreams.
As if we haven't had this
conversation a hundred times.
You've already agreed
to this.
This has been decided.
Me going to medical school
is decided.
Having this baby is
obviously decided.
And you've had plenty of time
to focus on your own stuff,
and I've been happy
to give you that time.
But now it's my turn.
You need to step up.
Now is the time to find work.
I have been working.
I've been working on
my documentary.
Do you have any idea how many
hours I've put into this thing?
Huh?
If I were to get
a day job now, that's it.
I would never have the time
to finish it.
And you act like it's so
outlandish it could make money.
I mean, <i>Tilt</i> made money.
Oh, please stop fucking
talking about <i>Tilt!</i>
It was four years ago,
and it made $15,000.
Do you think that's gonna cut
it when this baby comes along?
What the fuck is that?
I've been down here all day.

one dark motherfucker.
Yo, I know you wanna part the seas
so you won't get hit, but shit.
Hey, yo, son.

smack your stupid ass...
Bitch-ass!
Get your bitch-ass
out of here.
What do you want, man?
I've always wanted
one of these.
Saws kind of scare me
in general,
but this one's so handy.
Is this a good model?
Michigan 2621.
Look, man, I don't know
what you...
Kind of loud for this
time of night, though.
Your neighbors
don't complain?
You married?
No.
Why not?
I don't know. I...
I guess I like my freedom.
Yeah.
What is all this?
This is my way
of apologizing
for being such
an asshole lately.
You haven't been an asshole.
No, I have.
What is this?
What happened?
Oh...
I feel while I was
walking last night.
Last night? When?
After you went to sleep.
I took a break from working.
It doesn't matter. Listen.
You were totally right
about the job at
your mom's company.
I called Doug Park today and set
up an interview for tomorrow.
That's great.
But if...
you don't want it.
I mean, if it's gonna
make you more depressed...
"More depressed"?
Depressed.
You know what I mean.
No, you're totally right.
It's a good job.
I am the man of the house
and I need to start
bringing home the bacon.
Uh, speaking of which, I got
you a pepperoni from Masi's.
Oh, yeah!
Do you want
a glass of wine?
Can I shower first?
I can allow that.
This guy, is not doing so good.
Well, hello.
How are you?
Doug Park.
Thanks for coming in.
Yeah. Thanks for having me.
Okay, so, uh...
Joe, um...
Why don't you tell me a little
bit about Joe Burns Productions?
Looks like you were owner
and president since 2010.
That's right. Um...
It's my own
production company.
It's my passion,
uh, documentaries.
Um, my, my first feature, <i>Tilt,</i>
premiered at the Big Sky
Film Festival.
Very competitive to
get into,
and I actually got a small
distribution deal
as well.
Oh, wow.
Anyway, so that film was about
international pinball tournaments.
Specifically between
an American and a Russian,
who compete as fierce rivals,
only to become best friends.
Which might seem like
a light topic,
but, it's actually
a very, uh,
profound examination of
the role of chance
in a controlled system.
Okay, well...
Pinball. That sounds fun.
Um... Uh, so your last
job before that was...
Looks like Stan Grossman
Entertainment, 2012?
Right. Yeah.
Uh, they did mostly...
industrial films,
educational training.
I also did a lot of, um,
fundraising videos
for non-profits.
Oh, that's certainly...
rewarding.
Okay. So, have you
had any...
exposure...
promoting specific brands
or products
to corporate messaging
strategies?
Well, it's funny that you
say "messaging", because
because my current
documentary <i>Golden Age,</i>
actually focuses quite a bit
on the theme of messaging.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
But more as it relates to
the selling of a set
of values
than a specific product.
It's fascinating
how sophisticated
we've become
at manipulating people
to conform to a prescribed
set of beliefs.
And when in reality,
I mean,
we know that the only
true religion in America
is consumerism.
I mean,
have you ever seen
the way that people
worship their smartphones?
I mean, it's like the idolatry
of a religious zealot.
We've become addicted
to our things,
and all because of
this messaging.
This message that
consumerism and capitalism
will make you happy,
when in reality,
none of us are happy.
And look at how
obedient we've become.
I mean, we are less rebellious
as a populous
than we were in the 1950's.
Our mythical Golden Age.
That's the title of
my film.
<i>Golden Age.</i>
And I'm hoping
it could cause a...
real kind of
a cultural disruption.
Yeah.
Okay. Well, um...
Unless you have any more
questions for me, um...
I got another meeting
I got to run to, so...
- No.
- Well, great. Thanks, Joe.
It was great meeting you.
And, hey, I appreciate
you coming in.
Thank you.
Motherfucker!
Fuck you, piece of shit!
Joe, Joe!
Babe!
Baby!
What the hell?
This fucking thing
is a piece of shit.
Whoa!
What's going on?
Why are you so angry?
I bombed that fucking
interview today.
That's okay.
You know, you didn't really
want that job anyway.
Are you saying that I
deliberately sabotaged it?
No.
I'm just saying it's not
worth going berserk about.
I'm worried about you.
I'm worried, too, Joe.
Look, I don't know
if I can...
All right,
I'm gonna be honest with you.
This movie is not
going well.
It's like...
I'm...
drowning in it.
And it used to be the only
place I could go
to get my head straight.
And it's just...
It's not...
working anymore.
It's making it worse.
Okay. Um...
Making what worse?
Everything.
Me...
It's like...
It's like I'm getting more
and more outside of myself.
But not in a good way.
Like, I'm watching myself
do these...
things.
The other day I saw
a dog on the road.
I don't know.
Something is wrong with me.
Something is
just very,
very wrong with me.
And...
And I'm having
these thoughts and
I don't know if
this is the real me,
or if the real me is
this other person
that's thinking these...
these things, and I...
I don't know.
Maybe it's normal.
Maybe it's normal.
But it's not normal.
I know it's not normal.
It can't...
It can't be normal.
I can't be normal.
I know I'm not making
any sense right now, but...
I just...
I don't think I'm safe.
Joe...
You're safe.
You know, you just
need change.
You got cabin fever,
that's all. You're...
cooped up here all day
by yourself.
And... I know.
I get a little stir crazy
when I don't have
enough structure.
Maybe...
you could try and get your
old job back with Stan.
With Stan?
Yeah.
With Stan, after the way I left?
I...
I fucking hated Stan.
Okay.
It's just a suggestion.
Forget I mentioned it.
Listen...
I actually need to
go lie down.
My back is killing me.
We'll be okay.
I promise.
Everything will be better
when the baby comes.

Let's face it.
We don't really mourn
the dead we cannot see.
And of those we do see,
we only mourn the dead
who look like us,
who could be us.
Skeletal concentration camp
corpses...
That could be us.
Office workers jumping
to their deaths
from crumbling Twin Towers...
That could definitely be us.
So our empathy and compassion
are stirred.
But what of those dead
we never see?
What of the ones
killed by our own hands
at a safe distance
with the press of a button?
The fire bombing of
the cities of Japan.
The civilians killed by
drone strike in Iraq,
Pakistan, Afghanistan.
Fudge numbers.
Hidden coffins.
Censored photos.
Denials.
Distractions.
Disinterest.
Is it true?
Do our lives really
matter more?
Can we get away with
anything we want?
<i>Hello, this is
Detective Mike Brayu</i>
<i>calling from Hawaii County
Police Department.</i>
<i>We're following up with all
guests of the Onayo Bay Resorts</i>
<i>in Kailua-Kona
on October 15th.</i>
<i>And I'm trying to reach
Joseph and Joanne Burns.</i>
<i>If you could please
give me a call at 8085...</i>
- You fall asleep?
- I guess, for a bit.
What's your costume?
Horny nurse?
Ugh! It's so lame
that I'm going to
an MCAT study group
on Halloween.
It's fine. You obviously...
haven't missed any
big party here.
Well, at least you'll get to see
all the cute trick-or-treaters.
Oh, shit.
I forgot to get candy.
Mm. Well...
You should go for a walk. Check out
the costumes and the decorations.
Yeah. Yeah.
Okay. I'm gonna go.
- Okay.
- Mwah. I love you.
- Love you.
- I promise I won't be late.
Yo. You need some
party accessories?
Party accessories?
I got E, I got shrooms.
How much for shrooms?
It's $10 for one gram,
$20 for two.
Let me guess. $30 for
three and $40 for four.
I'll take two.
Enjoy the victory!
Enjoy the shrooms, bro.
They might be portobellos.
Joe?
I'm sorry I haven't really been around
since we had dinner the other week.
It's okay.
- That was fun though, right?
- Yeah.
Oh, my God.
Mia's like a little person.
She's like a full
human being.
Yeah. And she also kind of
looks like a mini Andy.
I will not tell her
you said that.
Speaking of...
how is Joe doing?
He seemed a little...
off.
He's... He's fine.
How's the job search going?
Good.
He had an interview...
But he's still looking.
Kind of feels like he's been
looking for a long time.
Andy just kind of felt like he was
getting a weird vibe from him.
Like a dark cloud...
or something.
Well...
that is probably because
it's a really stressful time.
Yeah.
Joe doesn't talk about it,
but I think he's really
freaked out about this baby.
- Sure.
- I mean, as am I.
Of course. It's not like
we really planned
for this.
Anyway, yeah.
He did reach out to me
the other day,
and I...
I wasn't very helpful.
I'd had a really crappy day
and I was super irritable.
And not to be
totally gross,
but I have not
taken a shit
in like three days.
You're pregnant!
You're pregnant.
He should be taking
care of you.
I know. I know.
But I still wanna
support him, you know.
He's had a rough
couple of years.
And it's not easy to just
keep putting so much energy
into something that
you're passionate about
that you don't get any
money or recognition for
in return, you know?
Yeah, I know.
But also,
welcome to adulthood.
I'm sorry, Joe.
I just wanna make sure that he
is stepping up to the plate
and taking care
of you.
I know. I know.
But you have to remember that
Andy was not exactly
Mr. Maturity
before Mia came along.
I know.
I mean, that whole
stripper glitter episode?
That was like
a year ago.
Oh! Thank you for
reminding me about that.
I've actually been
really wanting to
start thinking about
that again.
I'm sorry.
And now he's a great dad
is what I'm trying to say.
He's obviously
nuts about Mia,
and I think it's gonna
be the same for Joe.
It'll kick in for him
like it did for Andy.
Ugh! I'm sorry.
I am just like a fucking
hormone monster right now.
Don't be sorry.
I remember it
very, very well.
It'll get better.
It does?
In six months, when that baby
is out of your body.
And then, like a quick
18 years after that.
When they're supposedly
out of the house,
which I think just like straight
up doesn't happen anymore.
<i>Hello,
we're not available now.</i>
<i>Please leave your
name and phone number</i>
<i>after the beep.</i>
<i>We will return your call.</i>
<i>Detective Mike Brayu
calling again</i>
<i>from Hawaii County

<i>I'm trying to reach either
Joseph or Joanne Burns.</i>
<i>I have some questions regarding an
ongoing homicide investigation,</i>
<i>and it's very important
that you return my call.</i>
<i>Otherwise, I'll have to

<i>to the local precinct

<i>My number is 808-555-3341.</i>
<i>Please call as soon as
you get this. Thanks.</i>
I really like the whole
last name as the first name.
No. No Aiden, no Jayden,
no Brayden,
no Clayton.
Yeah.
I know. This is way too early
to be talking about this.
That's what Joe
says, too.
We have ten weeks to even
know what the gender is.
Okay. Just email them to me.
All right.
All right. I'll...
I'll talk to you soon.
I gotta go.
I love you. Bye.
Joe? You home?
Joe?
I'm the disruption, he said.
The wall is breached, I think.
With the inevitable truth.
Brace for disruption.
The wall is breached.
The wall is breached, I think.
With the inevitable truth.
Or should we say...
I'm a disruption, he said...
A new kind
of golden age. Disruption...
Joe?
Where have you been?
I've been so worried
about you.
What are you doing?
Joe?
What is that?
Joe, what is that?
Why do you have that?
Joe?
Please.
Why are you doing this?
I don't know!
No!
<i>Tilt.</i>
Scene 29, take two.
So, pinball seems like a
quaint, wholesome game, right?
Well, it might surprise you
there was a time in this country
where in many places
pinball was illegal.
Why? Because it was considered
a game of chance,
and therefore, gambling.
Back in the 1940's, the
mayors of several big cities,
including New York,
banned pinball as part
of a crackdown on...
Oh! Shit.
As part of a crackdown on coin
operated gambling machines.
Pinball remained illegal
for over three decades.
Then, in 1976,
this guy from New York,
Roger Sharpe, comes along.
He was known as a wizard on the
underground pinball circuit.
Anyway, one day, he set out
to prove to the courts
that pinball shouldn't be
part of the gambling ban,
since it wasn't
a game of chance at all,
but one of skill.
He said that if
you had enough talent,
hand-eye coordination,
reflexes, focus...
If you had enough
determination and mastery,
you could control the chaos
of the pinball machine
and bend it to your will.
To prove it, he did a demonstration
of his pinball prowess
for them.
He called a shot,
Babe Ruth style,
and made the ball go
exactly where he wanted it to,
right down the middle lane.
And now, to see if
I can control the chaos,
I'm gonna make the ball go
right here,
past the knight's head,
collecting 250,000 points
and receiving an extra ball.
Okay, ready?
Here we go.
And now.
No! No!
Damn it! Shit!
Cut, cut, cut, cut.
Oh, Allison. Hi.
Where the hell
is Joanne?
I've been calling her
all morning
and been getting
her voicemail.
She was supposed to be
at my house at 9:00.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I think she, uh...
I think she's out
running errands.
Um, she said something about
her cell phone being dead.
Unbelievable.
Did you guys forget that you're
watching Sebastian this weekend?
No. No, we didn't forget.
I think she's on
her way home. Uh...
Do you wanna...
come inside and wait?
Come on, we gotta go.
Yeah, all right. Okay.
Fuck!
We're already running late
for the airport.
Here.
Tell my fucking sister
if we miss our flight
I'm gonna wring her neck.
Bye-bye, sweetie.
Mama loves you.
We'll see you soon.
Oh, and thanks
and everything.
You're gonna smile
for your Uncle Joseph?
