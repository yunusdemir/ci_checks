Hi, how are you? I just...
you see what I am talking about here.
Mr. Hutchinson, could you please
look that over for me?
I got my own copy, this is for you.
We can get going,
I will look over what I have.
Let me help you outside.
I will keep everything.
This is all your receipts,
it's all for the transaction you did.
You're going to hold onto this.
It's all right, be careful in the rain. Oh, yes.
Okay.
<i>Everybody down.
Put your palms on the floor.</i>

I am sure you will be as pleased
with those reports as we are,
and trust you will enjoy
your business in Cincinnati.
Despite numerous attempts to move
our headquarters to a larger city,
we have chosen to stick with our roots,
give back to the community.
Hubert nationalists played a great role
in the revitalization of the queen city.
Something we're actually quite proud of.
Would you like to add
anything else, Mr. Hubert?
What floor are we on, Andrews?
14th floor, sir.
Which in reality is the dreaded
13th floor, is it not?
Yes, I guess it is, sir.
My friends, there is a spider
on the outside of the window here.
Brown recluse if I am not mistaken.
A spider that has climbed
13 stories so far without falling.
Which, considering today's lovely breeze
is most impressive, wouldn't you agree?
Why does the spider climb so high?
Is it striving to get to the top?
Or does its spider brain have
no concept of there even being a top?
Maybe she believes she can just keep
going up and up and up forever.
That's what I choose to believe.
Only small thinkers believe there's a top.
A plateau to reach.
We here a Hubert National Bank will never stop
climbing higher to maximize your bottom line.
I give you my personal guarantee
as president of this bank
that like my friend the spider here...
I will devour any little bugs
that get in our way.
- Sir, Dagley's on the phone.
- Excuse me, please.
Let me show you the rest of
our corporate offices, shall we?
How much?
I don't know yet.
Police have it all sealed up.
<i>- FBI?
- They're all over the place.</i>
<i>- Can you see Hutchinson?
- Yeah, I saw him.</i>
Are they speaking to him?
<i>No, they took him out. He's dead.</i>
What do you want me to do?
- Welcome to the shit show.
- Ready for you guys inside.
How long after the robbery
till the first officers were on scene?
- Twenty-five minutes.
- Why?
Because they laid out a device
with prerecorded instructions
saying it would explode if the cops
were called within 15 minutes. And?
And it was a car stereo,
but nobody moved for 20 minutes.
When your first action is sending a shotgun
blast through the bank manager's chest,
it sends a pretty clear message,
don't fuck with us.
- So the bank manager bled out.
- Nope.
- Just told he was dead.
- He is.
They executed him on the way out.
- He resist?
- Negative.
Witnesses say everybody fully complied.
Especially him.
Victim's name is Steven Hutchinson.
How much was taken?
Three million from the safe
and whatever was in registers.
Let me see that device they left.
- What?
- Sargent Mims...
- was the first detective on the scene.
- Motherfucker.
They tagged and bagged it before he got here.
I was told they found a print.
- What print?
- We don't know yet.
They said Mims is unreachable, I said
bullshit, I sent a guy down to the station.
That shady cocksucker, you find out
where he is before any of the cash evidence
goes missing too, and next time please
make that the first thing you tell me.
Mims, it's three doors down.
Okay, follow my lead.
Get your hands up!
Hands up, gets your hands up!
- Police!
- Hands up, don't move!
Get the fuck out of here!
Crack and wings? When'd that
chicken joint change the number six?
- Are you James Jackson?
- Where the fuck's your warrant?
Warrant?
This is my warrant. Man, you broke ass cop, we
know you going to skim that shit! Broke ass, huh?
Shit!
Just put a little Neosporin on that,
you will be fine.
Good afternoon, everyone.
We have a robbery homicide.
Brutal, professional,
yet seemingly also very personal.
We have a print, or at least we should,
but we have no fucking clue
where the hell it is! Chase.
They think the print
is from a James Jackson.
Do we have his jacket?
Possession, possession,
petty theft, disturbing the peace.
Really?
- Anybody else smell horseshit here?
- This guy's a thug.
There's no way he pulled this off.
- These guys are pros.
- Agreed.
They operated with precision.
We need the evidence,
and where is the evidence?
- Still with Mims.
- Why is it with Mims?
Anybody?
Because we allowed him to take it
from my fucking crime scene!
- Excuse me sir, who's Mims?
- He's an asshole.
And who the fuck are you? GI Joe?
Yeah, everyone,
this is new Special Agent Wells,
fresh out of Quantico with flying colors,
decorated Special Forces, renowned sniper,
- blah, blah, blah, yadda, yadda, yadda.
- Like I said, GI Joe.
All right, nobody takes anything
from my crime scene
unless it has been cleared, am I clear?
Now I want to know where the fuck it is,
I want to know where it is now.
- That's it, go! GI Joe, my office.
- Yes, sir.
- Getting settled in nicely?
- Yes, sir, thanks for asking. Close the door.
- Like to smoke weed, Wells?
- What?
- Do you like to get high?
- No, sir.
On your polygraph...
an abnormal answer...
causes the needle...
to jump as high as here.
Mine's beneath it.
But at a greater variance
than your other answers.
I figure with your Special Forces training,
lying to beat a polygraph
is probably child's play. So, I am going to
ask you one more time, for the last time.
Do you like the sticky icky?
No, sir.
Why the skip?
I smoked weed maybe three times when
I was younger to impress this hot chick.
- How hot? Ass for days hot?
- It was middle school.
When you applied,
you were asked whether you did drugs,
using marijuana is grounds for immediate
disqualification from the FBI.
I don't care if you smoked last week.
What I care about is honesty.
If you lie,
you withhold facts to get ahead,
I will cut off your balls and bury you.
Or fire you. We work as a team, we clear?
- Yes, sir.
- Montgomery.
When'd she get in? Thanks.
Bank manager's wife just arrived from vacation
with the kids, no one's informed her,
- you want to go?
- I will drive, where does she live?
Indian Hill, no, you won't, I always drive,
you can regale me with more...
hot chick stories.
Yes?
- Mrs. Hutchinson?
- Who's asking?
Special Agent Montgomery of the FBI,
this is Agent Wells, may we come in?
Please.
My husband isn't here,
but he will be shortly.
- Are your children upstairs?
- Yes.
- Please have a seat.
- Thank you. Please.
Mrs. Hutchinson, your husband
was killed during a robbery
at Hubert National this morning.
I am very sorry.
God, the kids.
Is there someone you can call
to come over? Family?
No, no, I...
I will be all right.
Take my card.
Take care of your family tonight.
If you can give me a call,
we will have someone bring you in,
ask you a few questions at a better time.
Do you work, ma'am?
What? No, why?
- Your husband the only source of income?
- Yes.
Again, we're very sorry for your loss.
We will see ourselves out.
What was that about?
Well, the average bank manager
makes 60K a year,
wife has expensive taste,
they live in a $2 million house,
and both kids go
to a private elite academy.
I saw the pictures, so...
Interesting.
Next time show a little more finesse.
- Yes, sir.
- She also wasn't surprised to see us.
She wasn't confused until I told her
her husband was dead.
Yeah, I saw that. You think she's dirty?
Something is.
<i>- Go.
- How's GI Joe doing?</i>
Jury's still out, what have you got?
<i>Cincinnati PD
has James Jackson in custody.</i>
We're on it.
We just got a front row seat
to the shit show.
Can't wait.
- Agent Montgomery, good to see you.
- No one paged you, captain.
- Monty, how you doing?
- I am good, I am good.
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Detective Mims had a lead
on a print discovered on the fake bomb.
He followed up, found weapons
and drugs at the suspect's residence.
So why didn't you wait for my okay
to go raid the apartment?
- I am Homicide. It was a homicide.
- Don't pull this bullshit on me.
I allow Cincinnati PD to fully
partake in my investigations,
but at the end of the day,
don't make the mistake.
That money says federal reserve now.
Well, you didn't do a very good job of reserving it.
- Wow, that's very clever. Mims, calm it.
- Captain O'Connell, shut the fuck up.
Do you know how I am able
to tell him that, Mims?
Because my official title
is Special Agent in Charge
which gives me the authority
over a Special Agent
who's over your Captain who's over you.
You don't take evidence
from a crime scene until I get there.
You don't do a fucking raid
unless I tell you.
You got a print? I want it.
- James Jackson?
- No.
The print belongs to T.J. Jackson.
- Say that again.
- What, you don't know who T.J. Jackson is?
He was a ranger.
Keyword there is was, T.J. Jackson's dead.
James Jackson is T.J.'s little brother.
We figured James had some of T.J.'s
old stuff, T.J. was a US ranger hotshot.
So maybe he had some of this
high tech shit and they used it.
- Huh.
- That's what you two figured?
That they'd be that precise
but not take the time to wipe it off?
These are thugs.
Did you see the tape?
These guys move better than a SWAT team.
No, if I were looking for thugs,
my first suspects would be you assholes.
This is not going to hold up,
these guys will be out in 15 minutes.
Sooner. Jackson's lawyer claims
she has a liquor store tape
of James making a purchase
at the time of the robbery.
And who the fuck are you?
Number three on that list
of people who outrank you.
Well, congratulations, gentlemen,
you have just been played,
it's called disinformation,
that print was put there on purpose
and you have given our suspects
a nine hour head start.
Well done.
Hey, by the way...
how much cash did you guys recover
from James Jackson's place?
- No cash.
- Nothing?
None.
That's strange because I always heard
that there was a lot of money
to be had at a drug bust.
That's weird.
Okay, people,
things just got a lot more interesting.
The print that our good buddy Mims found
is not that of petty thug James Jackson.
It is the print of his big brother.
His dead big brother T.J. Jackson.
Does anybody here
not know who T.J. Jackson is?
Wells, tell those pretending to know.
This young man, Alexander Hubert,
was held for ransom in 2011
by a rogue group of US Army Rangers.
One of those rogue soldiers was a
Cincinnati based native named T.J. Jackson.
Kidnapping went South,
Alexander Hubert died.
US Military swooped in
and killed T.J. and his accomplices.
I assume Alexander Hubert was related
to the Hubert National family?
Exactly, he's the younger brother
of Jeffrey Hubert.
Sole heir, now runs the show.
They're brothers?
They look like they're about a century apart.
- Theories.
- Let's talk motive.
Why did T.J. and his guys
kidnap Alexander Hubert?
- Money.
- It didn't work, T.J. was killed.
Now we have his print on the scene
of another attempt to get Hubert's money.
Well, shit, Monty, you're right.
This has certainly gotten more interesting.
<i>You have two voice messages.</i>
<i>Voice messages.</i>
<i>Hey, baby, don't forget to stop
and grab some wine. See you soon.</i>
<i>I am thinking how do you have
so many dirty clothes.</i>
<i>I miss you.</i>
Hi, Martha Wallace? Yes?
Yes, I am Special Agent Chase with the FBI.
I was hoping to ask you
a few questions about T.J.
Thank you.
That was you singing? Mmm-hm. You have
a beautiful voice. Do you perform anywhere?
Yeah, every couple of weeks
I play a jazz club.
T.J. used to come hear me sing.
How can I help you, ma'am?
Do any of T.J.'s old friends
ever come by to visit?
- No.
- No military pals maybe?
According to the military,
T.J. was a traitor.
You know they still have never really
explained to me what happened.
Wouldn't even release his body to us.
We had to bury an empty casket.
<i>Jeffrey Hubert of Hubert International</i>
<i>attended the opening of his newest
North coast branch yesterday.</i>
<i>It was just three days ago when one
of his downtown branches was robbed</i>

No, no, no. No, no, no! Drive to work.
Don't do... don't do this, please.
This is Dagley.

Who is this?
Hello?

Morning, Will.
Would you mind doing me a favor
and making sure that maintenance stocked
the bathroom with toilet paper? Thanks.
- Hi, Mr. Teegan!
- Morning, Michelle.
- Hey, Mr. T!
- Jared.
Hey, would you mind running
next door and grabbing me a coffee?
- Sure, I will go.
- Actually, everyone,
run next door, grab a bagel and some coffee, OK?
It's on me. You sure?
Yeah, I am sure,
I can handle any early birds.
- Thanks, what can I get you?
- Just a coffee would be great.
Strong feather.
<i>Open box 3-5-1-1-1.</i>
Wait!
Don't....
Will, get down!
<i>On the ground.
Cell phones in front of you.</i>
<i>Put your palms on the floor.</i>

<i>Hit the alarm or call the police

<i>On the ground,

Get out.
No.....
<i>- Yeah?
- They killed Dagley.</i>
<i>They left his body on the street.</i>
Goddamn it.
Excuse me, Special Agent, can you tell us
if one of the victims was a bank manager
- like the last robbery?
- I just got here.
- So you're saying it's not related?
- I am saying we don't know yet.
Why else would the Cincinnati PD
be investigating a crime in West Chester?
I will tell you what, Miss Adler, I will
be back within an hour to give you an update.
Okay. Thank you.
Four suspects in Kevlar masks.
And we have another victim.
- Bank manager again?
- No, it was the guy on the street.
His ID says David Dagley.
And he was legally armed,
but never had a chance to pull his weapon.
You should know the gunman
also saved the guard's life.
Sir.
What?
They didn't take cash.
They emptied the safety deposit boxes.
Go.
Mr. Teegan, how are you?
- I am alive, thank you.
- Glad to hear your family's all right.
Not glad to hear that you can open
safety deposit boxes
without the owner's keys or permission.
- You will have to explain that one to me.
- I'd like to wait for my attorney please.
Well, you're an employee of a bank
that contains federally secured currency.
You have to answer my questions
with or without your attorney
whether you want to or not
and you know that.
Okay.
Okay, this is a still from one
of your security cameras
and the suspect is focusing on a very
specific folder from a very specific box,
any idea who that box belongs to?
You know, I can't divulge that kind of information,
it's a violation of our privacy policies.
And that's okay because I already know
the box is registered to a Jan Martense.
- How did...
- How what?
Unfortunately, that's about all I know.
- How's your marriage?
- What?
I mean, are you happy, do you love her?
Did you make a good choice?
Did you pick well? You did, so you know
how lucky you are to have a wife.
Yes, very.
Thank God they didn't hurt my family.
So you're all good. Fuck the next guy!
Except for him, the cops show up...
and these guys are still in the bank
and they kill his family.
Now I want you to imagine that right now.
Soon as you leave here, the first call
you make is to a funeral home
to pick out a casket for your wife.
And then they show you
the special caskets for the children.
And all the different colors
and pillows and cushions inside
and you're sitting there thinking what pillow
would make them more comfortable
fighting the realization that they're already
dead so they don't give a flying fuck
what color they're buried in,
you motherfucker your wife is alive!
But that's not your problem... is it?
- Are we being recorded yet?
- Not yet.
How often do you think the owner
of a bank visits his branches?
I am not talking about the VP or anything
like that, I mean the man at the very top.
No idea, how many locations
does Hubert National have?
Almost 3,000.
Hubert probably doesn't ever visit any of them.
No.
Only the large main branches.
And those maybe once,
maybe twice a year at the most.
But Hubert...
he visits ours a lot.
Usually after we're closed.
Well, it's got a print.
- You run it?
- It belongs to T.J. Jackson.
What the hell's going on? Sir.
I need you to walk with me. Can it wait?
I have been keeping tabs on all large
deposits in the area since the robbery.
And. And exactly $3 million
was reported on the grid.
Why do you think
it's from the first robbery?
- Because the serial numbers match.
- What bank?
It wasn't a bank.
They may be a charity, but they don't
fuck around with their paperwork,
this better be in the evidence locker. Monty.
Shush. Don't shush me, motherfucker! Follow me.
I hid it back here so nobody would find it,
it's definitely the money
- from Hubert National.
- Yeah, I know.
Are you that big of an asshole
you think I wouldn't find out
you took money donated
to the City Mission from a bank robbery?
No! Monty...
look, the City Mission runs all donations
through me, I even signed it.
The reason why I didn't report it?
Because the whole department,
they leak to the press.
- Including you.
- You're fucking right I do.
But I know a hustle when I see one.
These guys are trying to make themselves
look really fucking good,
a $3 million donation to a charity?
The press gets hold of that, it will look
like the Boondock fucking Saints.
You're right.
You still should have reported it to me.
What, the FBI doesn't have any press leaks?
I know you guys do, it's not like you
make any more money than we are.
Guess again, I live up
in Akron next to Lebron.
- I am assigning an agent to you and your team.
- Fuck that!
Fuck you, "fuck that", do you have any idea
how incriminating it is what you just did?
There's just no pleasing you, man.
- Well, you keep trying, don't you, Mims?
- Yeah.
I got agents downstairs, they will be
taking the money off your hands.
Hey.
I made you breakfast.
You're home so late.
How you feeling?
Better.
You're here.
So are you hungry?
I am okay. I can't keep anything down.
Can you just hold me?
I was having the best dream.
- Are the security measures in place?
- Yes, sir, top of the line.
Staff was prepped this morning.
The fuck?
Press is already making
their own assumptions.
For the first time,
they're probably right.
Vanessa Adler, she's a reporter
for Channel 12, right?
The one with big tits.
She's also a writer for "The Plain Daily".
I only know about the big tits.
Look, Monty's assigned you
to Detective Mims and his crew. What?
You got to coordinate with CPD.
Cops hates Feds, you're the newest.
Least amount of hate.
Don't take any shit from those assholes.
Thanks for meeting me. I felt bad for never
giving you anything at West Chester.
- Do you think this is political?
- I don't know. Apparently you do.
Seven of 16 Ohio Representatives
and one of our Senators have accounts
- at Hubert's West Chester branch.
- I am sure they have lots of accounts.
Not with safety deposit boxes
where people keep their dirt.
Hubert lures these guys in
so he can spy on them.
That's interesting.
I don't recall reading that in your article.
Oh, that's far too sensitive a topic
with not enough facts.
And beyond that, papers don't
usually print stories of conspiracy
against the bank they owe money to.
So the paper wouldn't go against
its funding for a story, but...
with solid evidence you would.
It would have to be beyond solid.
- Hey.
- Hi.
At least drink the fucking wine
so I can send you to AA or something.
Give me a Bushmills Black.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
What do you think Velasquez
is doing right now?
- Oh, come on.
- Getting high?
Remembering how he killed my wife?
You want to talk about it?
I just did.
Good Samaritan bank robbers in Cincinnati.
<i>In a Channel Five exclusive,
we have learned that the suspects</i>
<i>in the two recent
Hubert National bank robberies</i>
<i>gave a reported $3 million
to the City Mission.</i>
Are you fucking kidding me?
Shit. You ready, let's go.
Where's the rest of your crew?
- Why, you want to babysit them, too?
- No, I am just asking.
- Where are we going?
- To see a security guard
who works a couple blocks from Hubert's
in West Chester, claims he saw a plate.
Wait... so no one's interviewed
this guy yet?
No. I guess the Feds can be just
as slow and inefficient as the cops.
Know who the VIP is?
Senator Cook.
Yep.
Any idea where Senator Cook lives?
West Chester.
It would be convenient enough for him
to do his banking at Hubert National,
why, what are you thinking?
I am thinking it's pretty fitting they are
having their little bitch fest in a graveyard.
Heard you met with Vanessa Adler.
- Yeah, you know her?
- Yeah, I banged her a couple times.
No, we bounce information
back and forth once in awhile.
She actually went to college with my wife.
Oh, yeah, you married? How long?
- Almost 10 years.
- How'd she fall for you?
I don't know you, I don't like you.
This is not about my wife.
Tell me about this guy.
Chris Hall, he worked at Icon Jewelry
a couple blocks from the bank.
- Private security, seems legit.
- Ten bucks says he asks about the Bureau.
Huh?
Eleven o'clock.
Chris, Agent Wells,
this is Detective Mims.
- Nice to meet you guys.
- Hi, can I grab you anything to drink?
- I am good, thanks.
- Okay, thank you.
- Thanks for taking the time.
- Where did you see these guys?
I didn't see them, I saw a black SUV
racing off down Oak Street
after the robbery.
- As I understood...
- It could have been anybody.
It could have.
You just have a habit
of writing down license plates?
Well, I work security.
Oh, so you must see a lot of action then? Mims.
I am sorry for the detective, Chris.
Please continue.
Look, I work close to the bank,
SUV peels out, cop cars show up,
I wrote it down, I mean, if you guys
aren't interested, it's cool.
Oh, no, no, we're interested.
We'd love to see the plate number.
I wrote it down.
Address and the location where I saw them.
Thank you.
Why didn't you come sooner
with that information?
I called right away, you guys were
the first ones to get back to me.
No, no, this is great.
Thanks for your time, we will be in touch.
Hey, guys, listen.
I was thinking about applying
to the Academy in the Fall and...
I was just wondering if maybe you'd put
in a good word, tell them I helped you out.
Yeah, we will jump right on that.
Special Agent Wells here will personally
inform the FBI Director.
Maybe even the President.
David Dagley, our victim in West Chester.
He was in T.J. Jackson's Ranger Unit,
Commanding Officer.
He alerted the military
about the kidnapping
and was the only one
who didn't go on the mission.
And guess who hired him
when he came back stateside?
- Jeffrey Hubert.
- Exactly.
- File for you, Agent Montgomery.
- Thank you.
Senator Cook.
Now what would your pretty
little wife think of these?
What you got?
Plate's registered to James Jackson.
James Jackson, I knew it,
my gut is never wrong.
Monty, he's not going to fucking believe it.
Call it in.
Fucking hates me, that guy.
<i>- Derohan, you around?
- Go ahead.</i>
I need you and Leon to stake out
1-5-6-9-1 North Central.
Look for a black SUV, plate number
Foxtrot Papa Tango Nine One Five Five.
The driver most likely
will be James Jackson.
<i>- Okay, for how long?
- Until I say so.</i>
Until the babysitter says so.
Understood.
You good? You want another pillow?
No.
No, I just...
I love you.
We're going to go on a beach
and sleep on a hammock
just like one of those beer commercials.
That's so sweet.
My husband's ideal romantic getaway
is a beer commercial.
I will go away with you on your
Corona commercial if I can, baby.
Of course you can.
We're going to go on a long
tropical vacation sooner than you think.
<i>How are you this evening?</i>
Who am I talking to?
<i>Robin Hood. I think it would be
more useful for both of us</i>
<i>if you didn't worry
about trying to trace this.</i>
<i>So I won't have to hang up
and we can have a conversation.</i>
You're taking an awful lot of risks.
Purposefully leaving evidence
at the scenes,
sending me stuff, now calling me at home.
<i>Yet, you still don't know who I am.
Oh, I assume you have theories.</i>
<i>Have you considered the possibility
that I am helping you catch</i>
<i>- a greater criminal than myself?
- Yeah, that's crossed my mind,</i>
but I really don't give a damn,
your crew's killed two people.
I am after you.
<i>Both were bad men.</i>
How do you know that?
<i>Eye for an eye.</i>
So this is revenge?
Was that a general statement or are we
bringing God into this conversation?
I mean, do you believe in God?
<i>I do, but I wouldn't go
so far as to say He'd approve.</i>
Think He's going to let you get into Heaven?
<i>- Why does that matter?
- If one believes in God,</i>
isn't that what it all comes down to,
where we end up after all this?
<i>Probably not, but maybe.</i>
<i>I will go to Hell so someone else
could go to Heaven.</i>
<i>- You got my package?
- I did.</i>
<i>Are you going to do the right thing?
So Senator Cook likes guys.</i>
<i>- Doesn't bother me.
- Don't be dense.</i>
<i>That's just the salacious details
to make the public pay attention.</i>
<i>I am talking about the documents with it.</i>
Yeah, they're intriguing, but I am not about
to start justifying murder and theft
as a means to fight public corruption.
<i>How does it feel knowing the man who
murdered your wife is still breathing</i>
<i>while your wife rots?</i>
<i>Does doing things the legal way
really make it better?</i>
FBI. Carrying a concealed weapon.
FBI, concealed weapon.
It's the only one I have.
Special Agent Montgomery. Good to see you.
Thanks for being here.
Can I get you anything? Coffee, tea?
No, thank you, this is not too shabby.
These robberies have been just terrible.
Money's one thing, but the unnecessary
savagery disgusts me.
Yeah, I noticed you beefed up
security downstairs.
Our customers deserve a sense
of protection, don't you think?
- Yourself as well, I am sure.
- Yeah, everyone.
So, West Chester...
you seem to have some kind of relationship
with the man who was killed there?
Dagley?
If you're referring to him informing
the military about the kidnapping plot
against my brother, then, yes, of course.
He was a hero.
- Were you and your brother close?
- Very close.
- You have any brothers?
- I do actually.
I was 20 years older than him.
I loved him dearly. Died far too young.
Twenty-four.
He didn't seem to follow
in the family footsteps however.
All of you with your Business
and Law degrees and Alexander,
- is a Philosophy major at Dartmouth?
- What's your point?
Well, one of my agents came across
a paper he wrote, it was published,
about the corruption of government
and the banking system
and its negative impact on society.
Yeah.
He was a bright guy.
Quite the young liberal.
I take it you lean
a little more to the right.
Not this year.
- I am trying to stay out of it.
- Me too.
I never would have taken you
as an enthusiast of the macabre.
- I find it fascinating.
- Lovecraft fan, huh?
- This an original?
- It's first collection.
- May I?
- Sure.
Books are meant to be handled
and read, of course.
Even incredibly expensive ones.
You a fan as well?
My wife was.
She loved all his ideas about a secret
world existing beneath our own.
Me, I get enough of that
every day at my job, you know.
But I read my fair share and there
was this one story in particular.
<i>The Lurking Fear.</i>
There was a character in it
named Jan Martense.
Which also happens to be the name
of the owner of a safety deposit box
that may have held compromising
information on your friend Senator Cook.
Why would you be holding dirt on him?
- Do you know who all my friends are?
- I only ask because I find it funny.
Why would you be blackmailing a guy that
you're the main campaign contributor for?
Thanks for coming by.
- Have George come in please.
- Security?
That's a first.
Not everybody needs a gun
to get things done.
What else can I do for you today,
Special Agent?
I am asking you simple questions,
just answer them.
What's the difference between
a question and an allegation?
An allegation is the one you don't answer.
A question's the one you do answer.
I don't think I need to answer
any of your questions, really.
- Let's not do theater.
- Okay, Special Agent.
Look, why don't you cut the shit and just
tell me who's behind this before you wind up
like Hutchinson and Dagley.
Or you could make a move
and I will shatter your face
against those floor to ceiling windows.
That's one of the things
that could happen.
Everybody down! Now!
Let's go, now!
Get out of here! Keep moving.
Move, move, move!
Down!
Move, move, move, let's go!
Move it out, move it out now!
Lower your weapons
and we will not harm you.
No, what are you doing?
Down here! I will fucking kill her,
I will fucking do it, I will fucking kill her!
So which one of you creeped up
on my computer last night?
Let him go!
I suppose these guards
deserved to die, too!
Maybe you boys
are just starting to unravel.
Give me the girl, I give you your man!
Otherwise, I put one
in your skull and one in his.
Whoever's left gets a prize.
Let her go.
So you're the boss man, huh?
Turn around.
Take the money and go!
On the count of three.
One...
two...
three.
Monty!
Hey, fuck off!
Get that goddamn camera back now!
Move! How can you not find them,
they peeled out in the middle of downtown!
Ah, shit.
You okay?
Should have been me.
Hey.
You see all those people over there?
They're alive because of you.
Let's get these assholes.
<i>- What's up?
- I got your plate match.</i>
<i>- How long has it been there?
- Just got here.</i>
Sit tight.
So what made you join the Bureau?
Fell into it.
You got that born on the 4th,
be all you can be look.
Special Forces. What about you,
what made you become a... Boy Scout?
I wasn't going to say that, but, yeah.
I can't remember, but I am sure
it was something good and noble.
Yeah, I am sure.
This is a photograph...
of our dead white victim.
Well, besides him conveniently
not having his driver's license on him,
- he also didn't have any fingerprints.
- Burned off, the molars pulled out, too.
Say what you want about this motherfucker,
but he was dedicated.
Where else do we find
this kind of dedication?
- Military.
- Definitely, absolutely military.
Which brings us back to T.J. Jackson.
But we all know T.J. himself
can't be involved, right, Chase?
- Because T.J. Jackson is dead.
- His body never showed up stateside.
Okay. So either these guys want us to think
they're somehow connected to Jackson's unit,
which is unlikely because
they're all dead, allegedly,
or they have some kind of point
to make about T.J. Jackson's unit.
You think T.J. Jackson had
a small unit, sir, or a...
big old large unit?
Stocky, you're a third grader trapped
in a grown man's body, shut the fuck up.
All right, anyone else? Any non-comedians?
Can you think of any point they may be trying
to make, anybody? All right, daddy's turn.
Here we have an entirely different platoon
not to be confused with T.J. Jackson's.
Who is this?
Hutchinson, the manager
killed at the first robbery.
What about him?
- Senator Cook.
- Before he was a senator,
Cook served in The Gulf War,
he was the commander of this platoon.
- Recognize him?
- Dagley.
- He was in Cook's platoon.
- Exactly, as was Hutchinson.
A very young David Dagley,
now let's fast forward to 2011...
where Dagley is the commander
of T.J. Jackson's Ranger Unit,
the unit that we all know went rogue
and killed Alexander Hubert.
- Everyone in the unit except for Dagley.
- Except for Dagley.
Dagley, who is connected to Cook...
who is connected to Hutchinson...
who is connected to Hubert...
who coincidentally hires Dagley
after his time in the military.
Jesus. Are you guys saying
what I think you're saying?
- What do you think we're saying?
- That Jeffrey Hubert, what...
that he somehow staged the whole thing
just to kill off his little brother?
Agent Montgomery, you told me to let you
know if PD tried to release Hubert.
- Why are we holding Hubert?
- Because he's a witness to a robbery,
I am not done with him yet.
I want him to sweat a little.
They're letting him go right now.
Officers, no one leaves without my permission!
Oh, Senator Cook, what a coincidence.
My colleagues and
I were just talking about you.
Is it customary to lock up
the victim of a bank robbery?
Can't remember ordering
anybody to be locked up,
but I am sure if you give me time
I can find some reasons to put you away.
They don't pay you enough money
to get a real suit?
Go back to that shitty bar that you hang out
and order that shitty wine that you never drink.
Tell me something, at what age was Alexander
supposed to receive his inheritance?
Because my guess is 25.
Tragic he died two months before then.
Fuck's the matter with you?
There it is.
No movement since I called you.
Okay, you guys hang here,
me and the stiff will go check it out.
Copy that.
- Yeah.
- Jackson's headed your way.
Follow him, hold back. See where he goes.
- CPD.
- Agent Wells, FBI.
- May we come in?
- Okay.
Thank you, we won't be long.
Was that James Jackson
leaving your apartment?
- Yes.
- Was he here long?
What's going on now?
Just going to ask you a few questions
and then we will be on our way.
Wells.
Well, that's an awful lot of money.
Did James give that to you?
Yes. Look, since T.J. died,
Jamie helps us out when he can.
- Where'd he get it?
- I don't know!
Any other police come by,
don't mention us.
You might want to find
a better place to hide it.
- I didn't take you for a softie.
- I really was a Boy Scout.
- What you got?
- We followed him to East side.
He's in a remote house
that looks abandoned.
We're going to keep an eye.
For fuck sakes, man.
- What's up?
- They lost James. Goddamn it.
This came for you, sir.
Get the fuck out.
Every day Christmas around here.
I want you to take these.
Jackpot.
A single file that lays out
the whole conspiracy.
And this was in this Hubert's
personal safety deposit box.
Now why the fuck would he hold on
to something so incriminating?
I think of it as leverage.
If any single individual in the conspiracy
wants to target Hubert as a fall guy,
he simply connects the dots.
This is his currency.
That's the one thing Hubert understands.
So what are we going to do with this?
I want to shove it up his ass.
I love it.
I handed off everything to Vanessa.
Good. Good, throwing this to her
should make things interesting.
I am still trying to get
an arrest warrant for Hubert,
turns out all his bluster about having
friends in high places, it's actually true.
You know, sir, I just wanted to say
I think it's really honorable,
you handling the case in this way.
What way's that?
Doing what you think is moral.
Doing what's moral. Meaning?
You made the right choice.
You refocused on Hubert.
You have no idea
what you're talking about.
I am going after Hubert
because he's an asshole.
And my main reason for going after him
is to shake out these cowboys that
have turned this city into the OK Corral.
But there's the greater good.
Are you suggesting
that these bank robbing assholes
are somehow doing the right thing
by leading me to a bigger fish?
Maybe.
Yeah.
I don't know.
My wife had her eyes cut out
of her head while she was still alive.
She was undercover trying to bring down
a drug lord, Mateo Velasquez.
He made her and he tortured her to death.
He nearly walked when Mims lied to the DA.
Why would Mims do that?
Well, he was trying to help me.
He thought he was doing the right thing.
And by the way,
Velasquez gave money to charity, too.
Nobody ever thinks they're the bad guy.
Leon's still out there.
Nobody's been in or out.
Jackson's inside, maybe he...
he's waiting for somebody
or maybe he's guarding something.
What do you think?
Estimated take from the robbery
is around ten million.
Most of it is in there.
I think you know
exactly what I am thinking.
FBI......
- You decided to show up.
- Paperwork, someone's got to do it.
Fuck paperwork.
I see you have had a couple.
I have had a couple.
All right, man, wake up. You're home.
Nasty, you got napkins?
Yeah, sure, right here.
Right here in the glove box. There you go.
You all right?
My wife has cancer.
Pancreatic. Terminal, she's in stage four.
Oh.
I had no idea, I am sorry.
Nobody knows.
I...
I can't let her go.
Then I wouldn't waste
my time here with me.
Hey....
- Baby, what are you doing?
- Where have you been?
I asked if you wanted to go out with us.
Are you serious?
Does it look like I could be
hanging out in bars?
- Brian.
- I am so sorry. Brian.
Please don't leave me.
Don't leave me.
I promise...
I am going to get us away from here.
I don't need to go anywhere.
I am right where I need to be.
I am so sorry.
<i>I have obtained
verified confidential files</i>
<i>that indicate Jeffrey Hubert
of Hubert National</i>
<i>was directly related to the death of
his brother, Alexander Hubert in 2011.</i>
<i>What was once believed
to be a deadly kidnapping</i>
<i>perpetrated by a rogue ranger team</i>
<i>now appears to be directly linked to none
other than our very own Senator Cook,</i>
<i>who falsely informed the ranger team
that weapons of mass destruction</i>
<i>were to be found at the temporary
Costa Rican home of Alexander Hubert</i>
<i>resulting in the young man's death.</i>
<i>The soldiers were then
tragically killed on the scene</i>
<i>and falsely painted as traitors.</i>
Do you know what I think about a lot?
Your death.
I don't mean with the lethal injection
that's probably...
what, a good 10 years away.
What I think about is...
Killing you with my own hands.
The way you killed my wife
with your own hands.
Yeah, Jackson's still alone.
Keep me updated. Derohan should
be there soon to relieve you.
You really think
all that money's in there?
Yeah, I really do.
<i>- Hell yeah.
- I will see you tonight.</i>
You know how much?
Thanks. Chicago office says one
of their Hubert National banks
just had two unauthorized vehicles
make cash pickups.
He's grabbing cash because
his accounts are frozen.
Could only get a temporary freeze,
but he doesn't know that.
He's panicking. Two trucks,
that's got to be upward $50 million or so.
Asshole like Hubert's got to have
foreign accounts, fake names.
Greedy fuck wants his cash now?
Tell you what, greed is what I am counting on,
we find the money we find Hubert
- hopefully with a warrant in hand
- How's that's coming?
- I am working on that.
- Where'd the armored trucks go?
I have no fucking clue.
We know the trucks left from here,
but where'd the money go?
I am thinking he'd head
to a small airport, right, fly South?
He's got three private planes.
One in Chicago, two here in Cincinnati.
We have men with all of them.
So far nothing.
- Who killed T.J.'s team?
- What?
We know Dagley ratted him out,
who did Cook send in to kill him?
- Is that relevant?
- Come on, Capt...
- what are you thinking?
- Sir?
Chase, are you sure that you tracked
down every one of Hubert's planes?
- Yes, they're all secure.
- I want you to start a new search,
every plane registered
under the name Jan Martense.
- Right away. But sir?
- Alright.
Do you want me to do that before or after
you go hear T.J.'s girlfriend sing?
- Tonight?
- In an hour.
<i># La la la la #</i>
<i># I live to say #</i>
<i># That you were mine #</i>
<i># I wish to say he cares #</i>
<i># But I guess not this time #</i>
<i># Can't fight the mood #</i>
<i># Loving someone else #</i>
<i># Sharing what I cherish most #</i>
You must think I am pretty foolish
to be here, huh?
No, when you love someone,
life just isn't life without them.
<i># Didn't think our love was ready #</i>
Want to stay for one more song?
That one's my favorite.
Subject is secure.
Let's go, T.J.
Where are you going?
I just got to do this thing.
Hey.
Be here with me.
That's all I need.
I love you.
I know, so just...
I just need to do this thing.
Okay.
Wells, Wells.
Chase got a lead on a cargo plane.
It's at Lunken Airport, it's registered
under the name Jan Martense.
She's also got a chopper
under the same name, Martense,
it's on a rooftop downtown. My guess
is they're going to use that chopper
- to get to the airport.
- Let's go, come on.
Anyone else from your platoon still alive?
- Just me.
- Then who did the robberies with you?
I didn't have nothing to do
with the robberies.
All right, so you weren't involved,
let's go with that.
Sure as hell looks like someone's
trying to frame your ass.
- How could someone frame a dead man?
- You don't look so dead to me.
Look again.
- I am out.
- Pick up a tail? No.
I just think we should do
this one by the books.
This was your idea, man.
It's just...
I can't do this.
- We shouldn't do this.
- Fuck that.
You don't want in anymore, that's on you.
We will send you a coconut from Mexico.
Hubert National robbers
are at 1507 East 31st Street.
- They're armed.
- Do you know what it's like...
not to be able to see
your own kid, your girl?
Out of fear that something may happen to them
if the government finds out you're still alive?
For five years I have been
watching them from a distance.
Still doesn't answer my question,
why do I keep finding your prints....
....all over the crime scene.
Maybe they let them there for you to find Hubert.
Who's they?
Why are you covering for them?
All right.
Forget it.
Let's go somewhere else, take me back.
Tell me what happened.
<i>Orders came down from our CO.</i>
<i>The mission was to go in
to eliminate a terrorist group</i>
<i>reporting an unknown quantity
of WMDs in Costa Rica.</i>
Does she look like a terrorist to you?
I don't see any weapons.
There are no weapons, somebody fucked up.
- Tell me this is a terrorist!
- We just killed innocent people!
- No, no, no, I don't believe it!
- Fucking believe it, man!
Squad leader, this is Alpha Six! These look
like dead American college kids, man!
What the hell is going on?
Abort! Abort, we're being attacked!
Fuck! Abort, we're under attack!
Abort, we're under attack!
How'd you get out?
Whoever's behind the robbery
snuck you out, didn't they?
You know the parable of The Good Samaritan?
Mm-hm.
This one's angry.
Where the fuck is the rest of it?
Put the gun down! Get down on the ground!
Get on your knees! Put down the gun!
Don't do it!
Get down on the ground! Get on your knees!
I want it brought to me,
Cincinnati PD does not take custody.
They do not book him.
I will take custody from the state cops.
Look who it is, come on in here!
Hey, Mr. Lucky, the escape artist,
how'd you get away?
- What are you talking about?
- Okay, explain this to me.
Why'd your boys just get arrested
with some of the robbery money?
Some of the money?
Yeah, you look disappointed,
I thought you'd have the rest.
Are they okay?
No, Derohan is not okay,
he's less than okay.
- Monty, we had a lead.
- So, why didn't you tell us,
why didn't you report it?
I will tell you why, because you were
going to try and rip off the load.
Now one of your boys are dead.
Deny that, motherfucker.
How'd you find the house?
- From a tip.
- What tip?
From the security guard
that got the plate at the robbery.
So you had a lead on a plate
and you didn't notify us?
- Wells had the lead.
- What do you mean Wells?
Wells had the lead!
- What do you mean Wells had the lead?
- Yeah, Wells brought me the lead.
Sanders, get me Wells' jacket now!
Connect me to Icon Jewelry,
it's in West Chester.
Yeah, I need information
on a Chris Hall, a security guard.
Wells was stationed in Panama in 2011,
right next door to Costa Rica.
Son of a bitch was in the country same
time as T.J. and he doesn't mention it?
You tell me you don't have
any security guards?
Units at the helm.
No, stop! The fuck is wrong with you?
Trying to take a chopper off in the middle
of downtown, are you fucking crazy?
- You motherfucker!
- Hubert got away!
We don't have to do this.
Yeah. We do.
Stocky, are you all right?
You all right?
- It was the kid.
- Yeah. Fucking GI Joe motherfucker.
- I was just starting to like that kid.
- Yeah, me too, my friend, me too.
- We lost Hubert.
- Forget about him, we will get him.
I am just glad you're all right.
You're not going to kiss me, are you?
Do you have breath mints?
Come on.
I saw your map.
I have been in these tunnels many times.
Everyone else followed you,
but I came here.
Mims.
Go home, Mims.
I can't.
You know that.
You made two smart choices today,
make one more and get out of here.
Nobody knows I am here, you can go.
You just need to leave the money.
I knew you were half a bad guy,
don't come here and rob me.
I am not going to take anything,
I just need to turn the money in.
Bullshit.
I don't know how much my wife knows
about the man that I have become.
I have done some really
fucked up things, man.
Really bad things.
But it ends here.
That's not how this
is going to go down, Mims.
I need to do it for her. This has nothing
to do with her. No. Maybe it does. Maybe...
the man that I have let
myself become is killing her.
Maybe...
....if I do this I can heal her.
This can't save her,
but it might kill you.
I got to try.
Are you kidding me,
I will kill you right now!
Put the gun down and go home to your wife.
If I leave, I am guilty.
If I have got dues to pay,
I will pay them.
This has nothing to do with you,
everything got fucked up.
Hubert is still out there. I need to do
something good with this money.
I am the one who has something
to make up for.
I can't let you get in the way of that.
- I need to take the money.
- Put the gun down!
- Walk away, Wells. Don't make me do this!
- I need you to drop...
Officer down in the old brewery tunnels.
<i>You're breaking up, repeat!</i>
Officer down in the old
brewery tunnels, come quick!
Tell my wife...
I died good.
<i>He hit the grid, Mexico.</i>
Hey, Stocky,
forget this call ever happened.
I knew if I trailed him
long enough you'd pop up.
So it was you I was holding
at the bank, huh?
Mims picked a bad day to go straight.
Ten dead, most of them not on your list.
Well, 11 if you count Velasquez.
Which I mean I figured.
A couple inmates gouge out his eyes with shanks.
That wasn't a coincidence, right?
- So was it all worth it?
- I don't know.
No.....
Well, T.J.'s finally safe.
He's back with his girl and his kid,
so there's that.
I know you and your boys
were sent in to kill T.J. and his unit.
It felt wrong from the start.
Only half a team was sent in.
That's never done.
It was supposed to be clean.
No bodies, no evidence left behind, clean.
They just kept telling us that a group
of soldiers had gone rogue.
That's what I kept hearing, rogue, rogue, rogue.
Didn't feel right.
I knew before we went in
this mission was bullshit.
Why didn't you speak up?
Are you kidding me?
I am not going to do a job that I was trained
to do because it didn't feel right?
With all due respect, sir,
I was a soldier.
Who was I going to tell that to?
After we were done,
T.J. was the only one left.
He was scared, confused.
<i>I took one look in his eyes</i>
<i>and it confirmed everything
I had been feeling.</i>
<i>We, all of us, had been set up.</i>
How'd you get him out?
Snuck him out in a body bag
and a weapon's crate.
So you and your boys can blame others
for your actions back then.
Who do you blame for them now?
We all lost sight of the point.
All the security guards
killed at the last robbery...
it all got fucked up.
I just couldn't stop it.
What was that point,
that you were going to get your revenge
and a few million in cash
for your time and effort?
I don't know, maybe?
So what are you going to do?
I am going to finish what I started.
It ends with Hubert.
No, Hubert ends with me, you lost that
privilege when you became a vigilante.
No, you don't get out of this that easy,
you have got more debts to pay.
All that money you and your boys stole.
It's not going to bring anybody back,
but I know a lot of people
who are suffering because of your actions.
I trusted you once, you betrayed me.
I am going to trust you again.
Don't make me regret it.
Miss. Can I have two glasses of Pinot Noir
delivered to that table? Thank you.
Is that Hubert?
What are the fucking odds
we pick the same vacation spot?
It's all right.
This one's all bark and no bite. Yeah.
Would you excuse us?
You might have just cost me
a $100 million deal.
Best news I have heard all week.
- I took the liberty.
- Thanks, hun.
Why not.
I guarantee you whatever they serve is
better than that swill you buy in your dive.
I prefer my swill.
I'd ask you why you don't drink it,
but I don't give a fuck.
What now, Agent Montgomery?
Surely even your little mind
understands this country's so corrupt.
What are you doing?
You can't touch me here.
Or else I could have you killed.
That, and it wouldn't cost me the price
of one of your cheap suits.
You really don't like my suits?
It's alright.
Well...
You're not drunk are you?
One sip of this?
I will go to hell so you can go to heaven.
