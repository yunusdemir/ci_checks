Frankenstein.! Frankenstein.!
Bring him down to the village,
and let's make it home.
- [ Dogs Barking ]
- [ Man Screaming ]
[ Boy Narrating ]
I thought I knew all about monsters.
I used to watch them late at night
on Dad's TVshow.
After we moved to Oakland, he stopped
doing kids'shows, because he was different now.
Everything was different.
Now he was Al Gory,
monster of ceremonies at Midnight Shriek.
[ Otherworldly Voice ]
Oh, Al?
What?
Oh, it's you again.
So, anyway, before we dig in
to our second feature...
I have to pay a visit
to my aging mother.
[ Cackles ]
She would've
wanted me to have this.
[ Boy Narrating ] It was on real late,
way past my bedtime.
Dad didn't let me stay up to see it, so I used
to wait for Mrs. Sampson to fall asleep...
[ Man ] Hold it. Hold it.
I think that was a good one.
and sneak
into his bedroom to watch.
- [ Electronic Warbling ]
- [ Man Yelling, Indistinct ]
But then I'd get scared,
alone in his room at night...
and I wouldn't know why.
I didn't know yet what
I was going to learn that year:
that monsters are real.
Whoa.
[ Boy Narrating ] We had
sort ofjust picked up and left Syracuse...
crossing the country,
finding a house...
the three of us taking care
of all the grown-up stuff together.
- Here. I'll get that.
- [ Doorbell Rings ]
- Who is it?
- I got that.
Come on, Dylan.
[ Boy Narrating ] I guess it
could've been strange being in a new place.
Can your dad
come out and play?
But it didn't take long for Dad to become
a celebrity among the kids on our block.
When's the monster
coming out?
[ Scoffs ]
There's no such thing as monsters.
You all know that, don't you?
Monsters exist
only in ourselves.
They live in the darkest chambers
of our hearts.
They never actually
come out into the world...
unless, of course, a metal light appears
in the sky, but when's the last time you saw that?
So why don't we try and be adults
about this and run along home, okay?
- Hey, what's that?
- [ Girl ] Mr. Leary.!
- What?
- Look. Look.
- [ Boy ] Look.
- [ Girl ] There it is.
- [ Growling Softly ]
- [ Kids Laughing, Screeching ]
- [ Screeching Continues ]
- [ Growling Loudly ]
[ Kids Yelping ]
[ Boy Narrating ] He was always
a madman for playing with kids.
Mom used to say that was because
he was reallyjust a kid himself.
Mr. Leary, what's this strange power
you have over our children?
I'm the perfect monster.
[ Growling, Cackling ]
[ Boy Narrating ] And the house we found
in Oakland was perfect for playing anything...
- especially the flashlight game.
- [ Chuckling ]
Come on, Dylan. In the closet.
[ Boy Narrating ] But it was different now,
the way he played with us.
- It was like he had to do it.
- [ Roaring ]
After the heartbreak had happened,
sometimes I wondered...
if Dad didn't need our games
more than we did.
[ Woman Vocalizing ]
- [ Vocalizing Continues ]
- [ Piano ]
[ Woman ] Okay. Right. That's right.
This is gonna be your bass note, okay?
Ready?
[ Singing ]
Where's ""C''? Right. Great.
[ Hums ]
Great. Now again.
-  [ Hums ]
- Sorry, Mom.
Right.
[ Continues Humming ]
[ Woman ]
Very, very nice,Jackie.
- Hey,Jackie.
- Hey.
Mom?
[Jack Narrating ]
Mom died last winter.
Dylan, don't wake Dad.
[Jack Narrating ] Dylan and I were
still learning things you need to know...
when you move to a new house.
Like in our case:
Don't play in the backyard.
[ Barking Ferociously ]
If you get caught
in there, they eat you.
[ Barking Continues ]
[Jack ] Out front, there was a whole
neighborhood to get to know.
Split the difference, okay?
Put the ball right there, okay?
[Jack ] Like Mr. Festinger, who always
yelled at his son Edward for being retarded.
- Edward!
- [ Boys Yell ]
Edward, what did I tell you
about your eyes and the ball?
Never take your eyes off the ball.
All right. You almost caught it.
You almost caught that one. Come on. Let's go.
[Jack Narrating ]
And Dexter, who lived next door.
[ Dexter]
My mom might be sleeping.
[Jack Narrating ]
His parents were really his grandparents...
because his real parents had split
from each other and from him...
and probably from everything.
- Guess what. We got company.
- [ Murmurs Softly ]
Let's go to my room.
[Jack Narrating ] Of course,
his grandparents weren't doing much better.
Did I tell you
he was a fighting Seabee?
[Jack ] No one else on our street would
let their kids play at the Mitchell's.
- [ Gun Winding ]
- Come on. Let's go.
Them that are over there.
That's them over there.
See? Over there.
Get 'em. Get 'em. Get 'em.
Hey, Zombie. That's right.
I'm talkin' to you.
The next time your dog
defecates on my lawn, he's dead, pal.
Goddamn son of a--
[Jack Narrating ]
And then there was Norman the Zombie...
who mangled one ofhis legs
in a terrible accident as a teenager...
when he crashed his T-Bird
into an ice cream truck.
He'd fixed up the car
and kept it on blocks in his driveway...
washing it every day.
You know, inside that cane
is a sword.
- I've seen it.
- And he attacked Mr. Festinger
one night with a tree branch.
Hit him
right over the head with it.
He also blinded his own dog
with a rock.
You ever look at it?
Looks like a dead marble.
- [ Boy ] Oh, God.!
- He's coming for us.
Get down. Get down, Dig.!
Get down. Dig.! Dig.!
Dig, he's comin'!
Is Norman gonna get us?
He's not gonna get us.
He killed his parents. You ever
seen 'em over there in a long time?
- I've never seen 'em.
- [ Boy ] You used to, walkin'around
behind the curtains.
I'm not going to go look.
That's for sure.
[ Boy ]
Maybe we should.
- [ Woman ] I'll get it.
- No. I wanna do it myself.
- Well, don't fall.
- Okay, kids. Get to bed.
- [ Dylan ] See? I can reach it.
- Don't give Ms. Sampson a heart attack.
- What's up,Jackie Bear?
- Uh, nothin'.
We're gonna have a lot of fun
at the studio tomorrow.
But as for now, it's off to work.
Buyin'a new car doesn't have to give you
a headache, not if you go to East Bay Dodge.
Ah. My old friend,
Psycho Ward Cleaver.
Put that thing down, Psycho,
and we'll go for a test drive.
You know, Psycho, this
beautiful Dodge Challenger is loaded.
- Air-conditioning. Power steering.
Blood bucket seats.
- Ooh!
[ Snoring ]
[ Boy ]
Michael, wait up. Michael.
Quiet. Quiet.
Shh, shh-shh.
- What do we do now?
- Let's go.
- We got it?
- Come on.
- [ Boys Giggling ]
- [ Spraying ]
What are you doing? What
are you doing? What are you doing?
- Norman is gonna kill you.
- Spray anywhere.
- [ Dog Growling ]
- [ Boys Gasping ]

[ Distant Barking ]
[ Barking Continues ]
[ Yelps ]
Jackie, wake up.
We gotta go downstairs.
[Jack Narrating ] He said
he'd cut his foot investigating a noise...
outside his house.
I couldn't figure out
why he didn't tell Dad the rest.
He must not have too many good friends
if he had to come to us...
in his time of need.
He has a sword in that cane.
Really?
Yeah. And he attacked Mr. Festinger
one night with a tree branch.
Really?
Wonder why
he didn't use his sword.
[ Sighs ]
[Jack Narrating ]
I guess that's when it all started.
I just didn't realize till later
that the trouble wasn't only with Norman.
Uh-oh. Me spill.
Who let this brat
into my crypt?
Spaghetti Bolognese? Now, how do you
expect me to clean up this mess?
This oughta do the trick.
Don't move, Dylan.
Hang in there. Okay. Cut.
Camera one, lock it off.
All right. You can move now.
- Peggy, take his clothes off.
- Come here.
- Hi, Peggy.
- Here you go,Jack. Hang onto that.
One day you're gonna like the girls doin'this.
Jack, don't you wanna be in the commercial?
[ Chuckles ] No way.
I have friends that watch this show.
- Give me the clothes, Peggy. Put 'em right here.
- Yep.
-John, can I see you for a second?
- Now, Gordon?
-John, can I see you for a second?
- Now, Gordon?
Right now.
Do you mind?
All right.
Well, let's take five.
What? What?
You canceling the show?
No, no. I love the show.
I love the commercials. I love everything.
- You gonna give me more bread?
- Look.
I've been fightin'as hard as I can for you,
but they're pinnin'me to the mat.
It seems they have a problem with
your Psycho Ward Cleaver character.
They think he's in bad taste.
- Why? Because he has multiple head wounds?
- Who knows?
So just think of another character.
Is this a suggestion
or a nonnegotiable demand?
It's a--
It's just a phone call.
- They make a phone call, and you roll over.
- Don't worry.
Your dad can always
calm Gordon down.
- You're layin' down on me.
- Course I am.
What? These people say ""Shit,''
and you say, ""What color?''
All right. Give me the jug. Peggy, run out
and round up a bucket of dog vomit.
We'll throw it on the rug.
All right. Come on.
[Jack Narrating ] Mom always said
Dad bristled when he got mad.
And some people
made him madder than others.
[ Dylan ]
Grandma! Grandma!
- Grandma! Grandma!
- [ Woman Chuckling ] Hi. Ooh, look at him.!
[Jack Narrating ] Maybe that's
where the trouble really came from.
- Look who's here.
- [ Grandmother ] Oh, my goodness golly.
- Ooh-ooh-ooh.!
- [ Grandfather Laughing ]
- Hi.
- Come on.
How are you? Hi,John.
- Whoa. Look at that!
- Hey. For you.
[Jack Narrating ]
Long ago in Hollywood, Mom's parents...
were put on a blacklist
they kept for Communists.
Though no one ever proved they carried
the cards, which is the way you could tell.
- Lincoln Steffens. Thank you, Grandma.
- You're welcome.
A great man,Jack.
Someone stays with you and your brother
while your dad's at work?
- Mrs. Sampson.
- Uh-huh.
- An older woman?
- Uh-huh.
[Jack Narrating ] I could tell he was
tryin'to get me to rat on Dad...
the way his friends
ratted on him long ago.
Fishing with red bait for something
he could hold against Dad to his grave.
Is he laying off the sauce?
Uh-huh.
[ Exhales ] You know, it doesn't
help make things better,John-- only worse.
Couldn't resist, could you, Syd?
Tsk.
- Didn't help your marriage much.
- Sydney.
- Is this why you came here?
- No. I came to see my grandchildren.
Then what are you doin'
talkin' to me?
[ Sydney ]
You leave the children with strangers.
What's even worse-- on their own.
[John ] I pay a responsible woman
to look after them.
- What the hell else do you want me to do?
- Don't use that tone.
- You're talking about
your own children's welfare, for God's sakes.
-John.
- [ Grandmother] John, listen.
We all want the same thing.
- I'm not gonna discuss this.
[ Sydney ] Fine. You keep drinking,
you lose this job like you lost the others...
and we'll go to court
and take those kids.
Tell you what, Syd:
over my dead body. How's that?
That's when
you can have my boys.
[Jack Narrating ]
They left that night.
- [Jackhammer Pounding ]
- [ Men Shouting ]
[ Kids Laughing ]
Dad? Aren't you
gonna take Dylan to school?
It's Dylan's first day.
Dylan, let's go!
- What are you doing?
- My shoes.
- [ Dylan Giggling ]
- Dylan.
- [ Continues Giggling ]
- Dylan! Do you want the dogs?
[ Sighs ]
I want Daddy.
- Daddy's asleep.
- I want Daddy take me to school.
Daddy! Daddy!
[ Dog Barks ]
[ Man ] Come on. Come on.
We live around here.
[ Men Chattering ]
[ Kids Chattering, Laughing ]
I want Daddy.
Where's Mommy?
""Where's Mommy?''
Listen, Dylan.
- You have to go in there, okay?
- No.
They'll be nice.
You have to. You have to go.
Okay? Come on.
I'll pick you up later.
Now, go. You have to go.
Go.
Japanese poetry is a drama.
It's about life and death.
- It's--
- Um, sorry I'm late. I had to--
It's okay. Have a seat.
That's right. No desks.Join us.
- You have a desk.
- Table.
- Wanna sit at it?
- No, sir.
- No ""sir'' either.
- [ Child Giggles ]
The name's Vince.
Hi,Jack.
I know about your mom.
So. We have a lot
of things for each of you to try.
Besides the electrical experiments
and the herb garden...
there's a ""learning to communicate
your feelings'' workshop I'll be teaching.
[Jackhammer Pounding ]
Oh,Jesus!
Ohh.
[ Woman ]
That's very nice.
There you go.
Hold onto my hand.
[ Kids Laughing, Chattering ]
[ Boy ]
Throw your ball. Throw your ball.
Throw your ball.!
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.
Actually, uh, I was supposed
to drop off my son today.
I was detained, and, uh, I just came by
to see if he was okay.
- How old is he?
- He's three. It's his first day.
[ Woman #2 ]
Okay. Take it easy.
[ Woman ] Ifhe's doing all right,
maybe you should let him be.
- It might be harder ifhe sees you.
- [ Sighs ]
He's a good kid.
I'm gonna go.
[ Men Chattering, Shouting ]
[ Sirens Wailing ]
[ Chattering ]
[ Man ]
Get back in here.
- Is there a fire?
- No.
It's that lady in there.
The kid came home and found her.
She's barely alive. There must be
a square yard of pill bottles in that place.
- Dexter, is your mom sick?
- No.
She's just not moving.
[ Woman Screaming ]
[ Screaming Continues ]
[Jack ] I knew right away, when I saw Dexter
coming home from school with his lunch pail.
He looked like an angel or a girl...
his face all soft
and rosy and sweet.
My mom's dead.
Did you hear
about Dexter's mom?
Yeah.
- [ Dylan Giggling ]
- Dylan, no! Dylan.
You wearin' those
to school or what?
[Jack Narrating ]
The weeks went by, and fall came...
with cold mornings,
like in Syracuse.
Things had started to change. There was
even a girl at school who started talking to me.
Hi,Jack.
Hi, Karen.
[Jack Narrating ] She was what my dad
called "a long drink of water. '"
I wanted to tell you that I really liked
what you wrote for the poets' corner.
- I thought it showed great sensitivity.
- [ Man Singing ]
- It did?
- Yeah.
Thanks.
[Jack Narrating ]
I figured I was really lame, because I knew...
there was something I should do about
the situation, and I didn't know what it was.
[ Man Continues Singing ]
Would you like to come to my house
for some Hungarian goulash...
Friday night
at about 6:30 p.m.?
Sure.
Oh.
Great.
- [ Ends ]
- Yes! She said yes!
- [John On Phone ] All right.
- So I told her goulash.
- Great. I'll make my famous goulash.
- Really?
- Of course.
Maybe we should invite somebody, so it's not just
her surrounded by three men. What do you think?
- Who?
- I don't know. Maybe Peggy.
[Jack Narrating ] I know it was stupid,
but I found myself wishing...
Mom could somehow fly back
into the world.
It's up to you,Jack.
Whatever you want.
- Yeah. No. That'd be great.
- Great. This is great.
- [Jack ] Should I button it?
- We're casual tonight, right?
- So you're saying I shouldn't button it?
- It looks good like that.
- Only you need a sweater. It's raining.
- I don't have any sweaters!
- What time is it?
- You got plenty of sweaters.
- Dad, I have to leave.
- Relax. Try on a sweater.
- Nothing goes!
- This goes.
[ Screeches ]
I have to get out of here. I'm taking this.
- That's good. It's clear. It doesn't clash.
- I'm going, okay? Good-bye.
Don't you want me to iron that for you?
Aren't you interested in what I'm gonna wear?
- [ Stereo:Rock ]
- What am I gonna wear?
[ Thunderclap ]
[ Stereo: Classical ]
- Would you like a V8 juice?
- V8 juice? Sure.
- You must beJack.
- You must be Mrs. Morris.
- Karen should be right down.
- Okay.
[Jack Narrating ] I was afraid
they were gonna ask about my family...
and I'd have to tell them about Mom.
- [ Approaching Footsteps ]
- There you go,Jack.
Thank you.
[Jack Narrating ] And then they'd have
to say, "We're sorry to hear about that. '"
And then I'd have to say,
"That's all right. You didn't know. '"
And then there'd be that awful silence
where there'd be nothing else to say.
- So,Jack, tell us about your--
- [ Karen ] Hi,Jack.
Hi.
[ Crickets Chirping ]
- What happened here?
- Nobody knows.
They just showed up one day.
- [ Stereo:Big Band ]
-  [John Humming To Beat ]
Hi, Dad. This is Karen.
- Oh, how are you, Karen?
- Hi, Mr. Leary.
It's very nice
to meet you, Karen.
Peggy Etinger, this is my son Jack Leary
and his friend Karen Morris.
- [ Both ] Hi.
- Karen, this is my friend Peggy Etinger
and my son Dylan.
Dylan, this is your brother's friend
Karen Morris, and your brother, who you know.
Jack, this is your brother Dylan, who
you know, and my friend Peggy Etinger.
Does anybody know who's playin' in there?
That's Glenn Miller.
Okay. Here we go. It's time you kids
learned classical music. Very nice.
- Thank you, Peggy.
- You're welcome.
[ Continues ]
[ Macabre Voice ] At last...
the goulash you've all been waiting for.
- I want my goulash! I want my goulash!
- [ Peggy ] I'll serve.
I'll do it. Thank you, my dear.
You may have your goulash.
All right. You do--
[ Macabre Voice ] the goulash. I do the wine.
- The goulash!
- Great year for Welch's.
- Tasty goulash. Eat that all up.
- For you.
- Excuse me. Pardon me.
- So, Mr. Leary,Jack tells me
you used to have a kids' show.
He told you that, eh?
[ Gangster Voice ] Thank you very much.
- Miss Etinger, a little goulash?
- [Jack ] Come on, Dad.
All right.
You broke my arm.
Hi, boys and girls.
Are you here for kids' stuff?
Well, hold your horses
and tie up your dragonflies...
because today
we're gonna talk about colors!
Red, green, blue,
orange, chartreuse!
- [Jack Narrating ] Dad was really on.
- "Goulash,John?'"
"Don't mind if I do-yash. '"
- [Jack ] Heart.
- [John ] Heart. Yeah.
Don't call clubs.
Don't call clubs.
Don't call clubs. Karen.
Karen, look at my eyes. Look at me.
Don't call clubs.
Don't call clubs.
- Don't call clubs. Don't call clubs. Don't call clubs.
- Clubs!
Don't call clubs!
Oh, clubs! Ohh.
Oh, no. Clubs.
She called clubs.
No clubs.
- That ain't a club. No.
- [Jack Narrating ] He was like an artist.
Only what he was creating
was the perfect evening.
She called--
She called clubs.
- She called clubs.
- [Jack Narrating ]
And it was all for Karen and me.
- In the closet. There's a secret passageway.
- [John ] Coming.!
- Where are you?
- Come on. Let's go.
As we come--
Where are you?
[ Macabre Voice ]
Are you in here? No?
Ha! Back off.
- [ Laughing ]
- Up the stairs we come.
[Jack Narrating ]
Someday, if I ever get that far...
maybe I'll be able
to do the same thing for my son.
[John ]
Where the hell are those kids?
- [John ] It was great
meetin' you. I'm glad you came.
- It's so nice to meet you.
- All right.
- Nice to meet you.
- It was nice to meet you too.
- Bye.
- See you later. Okay.
- [ Karen Laughs ]
- [Jack ] Good night, Dad.
- Good night.
- You want me to drive you? You want a ride?
- No. Good night.
Good night, Dad.
I was being sincere.
It really was a lovely evening.
I hope there will be more.
Do you wanna come in?
Well...
good night.
Good night.
[ Man Singing ]
[ Whooping ]
- [ Continues ]
- [Jack Narrating ] I don't know
what it was--maybe the rain--
but after that night, everything
just started falling into place.
[John ] All right.
We got 'em. We got 'em.
[Jack ] The Oakland A's made it to the Series,
and we sat glued to the set for all seven games.
- Two down.
- Two down!
- [ Announcer] And here we are--
- [Jack ] Oh, no! It's Pete Rose, Dad!
- [John ] No sweat. No sweat.
- [Jack Narrating ] And on that last fly ball...
- [Jack ] Come on! Come on!
- we were on our feet, because we were champs.
[ Screaming ]
- Whoa, yes! Yes!
- Play ball!

Whoa, Cookie Monster!
Whoa, Cookie Monster!
One bag of cookies.
One bag. One bag.
- Daddy!
- Okay. Okay. Let me--
[John As Monster ] I'm gonna let you
in on a little secret:My tongue grows.
So from time to time...
I have to nip a little off...
like this. [ Grunts ]
Ah. Blech!
[ Lisping ] There.
That's much better, don't you think?

[ Truncated Scream ]
Hey, Dexter.
You like television?
[Jack Narrating ]
Dad always went all out for Halloween.
But later that night,
he went too far.
- [ Door Rattling ]
- [John ] Come on,Jackie. Open the door.
What are you tryin'to tell me?
You're too old to run around in a costume?
- How do you think that makes me feel?
- So don't wear one then.
- No one's making you.
- I like wearing one.
- Well, good.
- Jackie, come on. It's Halloween.
You can wear a costume
and still be dignified. Look at me.
[ Knocking ]
[ Sighs ]
- Trick or treat.
- [ Lisping ] Trick or treat.
All right, Mr. Adult. The candy cauldron's
right here by the door.
If you run out, there's more
in the cupboard by the fridge.
If you run out of that,
there's always the change jar.
Okay, Charles. Let's go and leave
your brother to reflect on his lost childhood.
Here you go.
Hold that bag.
Come on now.
Do not fall.
- My little brother's a clown.
- Where is he?
[ Kids Chattering ]
[ Knocking ]
Hi,Jack. Trick or treat.
Hi, Katie.
Hello, Edward.
We saw your dad down the street.
He's dressed like a big rabbit.
- I know.
- Well, bye.
[ Knocking ]
Hi, Mike.
- You recognize me?
- Sure.
Man, you're full of it.
You real-- You recognize me?
- Bye, Michael.
- What? Okay, okay. Wait.
- What are you supposed to be?
- Me?
- You.
- Myself.
You're-- You're
gettin' strange, man.
[ Line Ringing ]
- [ Man ] Hello?
- Hello, sir. It's Jack Leary. Is Karen there?
Uh, no, she's not here.
She went to the party with her friends.
- What party?
- Big Halloween party.
- Oh.
- Want me to tell her you called?
- No. That's okay.
- You sure?
- Thank you.
- Okay.
- [ Knocking ]
- [ Doorbell Ringing ]
[ Knocking Continues ]
Trick or treat,Jack.
Trick or treat,Jack.
Dexter, where'd you get the--
Thanks.
How'd I do?
Wow. Huh?
Not a bad haul, considering I had to lug
your brother halfway around the neighborhood.
- Dad.
-Jackie, where would Dexter get a Nazi uniform?
- Norman gave it to him.
- He probably was dressed as a bus driver.
- Yeah, but, Dad, he went like this.
- Don't do that in this house.
What are we gonna do about it?
- [ Doorbell Rings ]
- That's Mrs. Sampson.
Dad.
[ Sighs ]
How you doin', Norman?
What? Are you out
trick-or-treatin'?
No. I'm taking this opportunity
to collect contributions...
for state assembly
candidate Elder MacIntyre.
Mr. MacIntyre is
a former law enforcement officer.
I know who he is.
Because...
I grew up on this street.
- [John ] Excuse me?
- When I was a kid,you didn't see them around.
- They kept their distance.
- ""They''?
The niggers and theJews.
Ohh. "They. '"
Mr. MacIntyre can help us...
but he needs our help.
- [ Grunting ]
- Anything you could spare
would be greatly appreciated.
Halloween is my favorite holiday.
I love seein' their costumes.
- What did you go as?
- A bunny.
Well, all right.
Excuse me, sir.
- Mrs. Sampson.
- Hi,Jackie.
[Jack ]
Hi, Mrs. Sampson.
As one white man
to another.
I moved across the street
from a goddamned nazi.
Oh, my God!
""Niggers and Jews.''
Excuse me, Mrs. Sampson.
- You're notJewish, are you?
- No. I'm a Jehovah's Witness.
- Sorry about this, Mrs. Sampson.
- Don't worry, honey.
Nothing you can do about it.
[ Sighs ]
Elder MacIntyre.
[ Scoffs ]
[ Man On TV]
Milltown--
[Jack Narrating ] Dad showed
Invasion of the Body Snatchers
that night, his favorite movie.
He said it was really about all the stupid people
who worried that Communists...
were gonna
take over the country.
And all the towns around us. It's a
malignant disease spreading through the country.
[ Static ]
I don't wanna alarm you...
but check out
what this movie is really about.
Pods from outer space?
[ Chuckles ]
Some small town
called Santa Rita?
This is your town.
[Jack Narrating ]
He was drunk, not pretending.
I could tell by his half-closed eyes
and the slow way he moved.
Look again at that man across the street,
watering his lawn...
- Go to two.
- [ Man ] Two's off the set.
or that woman
climbing out of her Pontiac...
[ Objects Clattering ]
carrying her grocery bags.
- How big is that nose?
- Dad, don't do this.
Who are these people moving in?
Niggers?
Jews? Commie bastards?
Shit.
You turn around,
and one day, there they are.
If you don't wanna
think about it, don't...
but if you're smart...
- Oh, my God.
-you'll join me...
and candidate...
for assembly
Elder MacIntyre--
- Cut him off.
- Anything you can spare...
- Cut him off now.
- will be greatly appreciated.
Thank you
for your kind attention.
Sieg heil.
Get ready
to send them out.
[Jack Narrating ]
He was really big up close.
I knew it was wrong, but I thought
of dragging him over to Festinger's lawn.
I figured I'd leave a trail...
or someone coming out
of their house to get their paper...
would look over and see me.
If I could do it all over again,
I would've rolled him there if I had to.
Absolutely.
- Dad.
- [ Groans ]
Where was I?
Dad?
Martini, like Daddy.
[ Siren Wailing ]
[Jack Narrating ] The vet said poison,
and we were the prime suspects.
No matter where Cheyenne was poisoned,
stumbling around, coughing his guts out...
it was our front yard
he finally crashed on.
[ Chattering ]
- What the heck do you want me to do,Jackie?
- Tell him we didn't do it.
- He doesn't think we did it.
- Dad, after last night?
[ Sighs ]
[ Dog Barking ]
[ Barking Continues ]
Uh, Norman, hi.
Uh... I came over here
to apologize to you.
I did a very mean-spirited thing
on my show last night.
I don't know if you saw it.
I was drunk.
I know that's no excuse.
I don't know
what you're talking about.
I didn't kill your dog, Norman.
I'm sorry that somebody did.
I didn't poison your dog,
Norman.
If you knew me better,
you'd know it's not my style.
I'd have shot him.
[John As Monster ] For those of you
whose brains aren't totally withered...
here's a startling demonstration.
My old friend
Psycho Ward Cleaver will do the honors.
Take 'em away, Psycho.
- Not enough blood.
- That's plenty.
Hey, I finally found The Beast
with a Million Eyes.
Ooh. We'll put it on Friday night
with Mr. Sardonicus.
- Okay.
- [ Gordon ] John.
John?
- [ Whispering ] I think you need some time off.
- What?
You need a break.
Last night was too much,John.
- Do I get to decide how long a break I need?
- No.
So you're firing me? Is that
what you're saying? You're firing me?
- Don't press it,John.
- Well, I wanna press it. I think I should press it.
- I'll take a week off.
- [ Cabinet Slams ]
[ Rod Clanks ]
[ Man Singing ]
What turned your motor on?
Look,Jack. I think it would be best
if we began seeing other people.
I mean, we can still be friends.
I'm just too young to tie myself
to one guy,Jack.
Where did you hear this?
On television?
It's just the way I feel.
[ Vocalizing ]
[ Singing Resumes ]
[ Vocalizing Resumes ]
[Jack Narrating ] I didn't know why
Dad stopped going to work.
I asked him ifhe was looking for a newjob,
and he wouldn't even talk about it.
[ Barking Like Seal ]
It wasn't like he had
changed in any way.
- [ Barking Continues ]
- I don't know. Maybe
we werejust growing apart.
[ Ends ]
- So what's the story?
- No story.
Did you see any other fathers
acting like seals?
- Somebody had to do it.
- Could you ever just stop for, like, one minute?
[ Foghorn Blowing, Distant ]
I need to know if you plan on
being Bozo the Clown your whole life.
[ Snickers ]
Listen to this. Who's the father
and who's the son here?
I don't know.
- Open the goddamn door, Dylan.
- [ Dylan ] It's locked.
I know it's locked.
You locked it. Now unlock it.
- I don't know how.
- Then turn off the goddamn water.
- I don't know how.
- Turn those goddamn knobs.
- I don't know how.
- Goddamn it!
[ Screeches ]
Goddamn it!
- I said, come on!
- No!
- No!
- [ Dogs Barking ]
No,Jack. No! No!
- No,Jack! Please, no!
- [ Barking Intensifies ]
- [ Barking Continues ]
- [ Dylan Crying ]
Now, you stay there!
Stay there!
Jack! [ Crying ]
Thank you,Jack.
[Jack Narrating ] I was beginning
to wonder if the awful reprisals...
we expected from Norman
weren't coming instead from ourselves...
from the darkest chambers,
as Dad said, of our hearts.
-  [ TVTheme ]
- I'll pay you a nickel to watch my brother a while.

Surprise! Happy birthday!
[John ]
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey,Jackie.
What's the matter? Hmm?
- They all saw me singing.
- So?
- Well, they're laughing about it.
- Oh, no, they aren't.
They're laughing because
they're at a party. They're happy.
- [ Chuckles ] Jackie Bear.
- Don't touch me.
Get out of my room.
Get out of my room now!
Get out!
[ Doorbell Ringing ]

[ Knocking Continues ]
[ Doorknob Rattling ]
- Where's Dylan?
- He's gone.
Where?
- Where?
- There, in the street.
My brother doesn't
go in the street.
Look, man, my brother is my responsibility.
Now, where the hell is he?
Does this mean
I don't get to keep the nickel?
You want to die?
Talk! Talk! Talk!
- Norman.
- Norman what? Norman what?
- Come on! Tell me now!
- He took him in a car.
Norman's car's
right there, idiot!
It doesn't even have a motor!
Hey!
[ Grunting ]
- What car?
- Another car. A white car.
You're supposed
to be watching him!
He's your brother.
Please get off of me.
- I'll get off you if you swear
that you won't run away.
- I swear!
- I'll kill you if you run away!
- I swear.
Hey!
Ow!
[ Grunting ]
Where's my brother?
I need the police.
It's an emergency.
I need them to come
to my house right now.
[Jack Narrating ]
It was like a dream...
where your legs keep moving,
but you can't get anywhere.
I knew I should be finding him,
but I didn't know where...
or who to ask,
or what to do.
- What's the trouble,Jack?
- Norman kidnapped my brother.
Dexter saw it,
but he wouldn't tell me what happened.
What? Hey, Dexter!
Get over here!
Get over here.
- Tell me, boy, or I'll whale you!
- Ow!
Hey, Mitchell,
what the hell are you doing?
- None of your business. Shut up.!
- Don't tell me to shut up.
I'll put your head through the window
of that ugly camper. Don't tell me to shut up.
- It's none of your business!
- Anything that happens
on this block is my business!
- What're you hittin' the kid for?
- You got your nose in everybody's business.
- This is my family.
- What the hell's going on here?
- [ Festinger ] Leave the kid alone.
- My brother was kidnapped!
Are you the person who called?
- I was in the house, and he's
supposed to be watching him.
- Tell him what you saw!
- He was kidnapped by Norman Strick.
- There's the father.
[Jack ]
White car.
Sir?
I'm sorry to have to tell you, but we believe
one of your sons has been kidnapped.
[ Festinger ] Norman Strick,
that son of a bitch, took Dylan away in a car.
[ Mitchell ]
Dexter, tell him what Norman did.
[ Policeman ]
I just need some information from you, sir.
We'll start the search--
Sir?
Look, who is this man
who took him away?
His name is Norman Strick.
He lives right over there.
[ Police Radio:
Woman, Indistinct ]
How are you doin', son?
[Jack Narrating ]
It was getting to be his bedtime.
All I could think was that Norman was just
gonna pull up any second with Dylan...
just pull up outside
with an ice cream cone.
No!
[Jack Narrating ] Mr. Festinger
thought he'd died and gone to heaven.
He threatened me once
with a tree branch.
The man belongs in an institution.
I think he's a nazi.
[ Narrating ]
He was the real poisoner of Cheyenne.
Why didn't Norman steal Edward?
[ Man ]
Ten seconds,John.
Nine, eight, seven, six...
five, four--
John,you're on.
Yesterday at 5:00 p.m....
my son...
was taken by this man.
His name is Norman Strick.
He's in his late 20s.
Walks with a cane.
[ Sighs ]
He was--
He took him
in a white car.
My name is DetectiveJohn Marker
with the Oakland Police Department.
We're asking your help
in locating this missing child.
His name is Dylan Leary.
He's three and a half years old.
Dad?
We're at a crossroads.
Can you feel it?
It's dark down there...
and there are things
nobody...
wants to meet in the dark.
Whether we'll come out
on the other side...
hating everything...
and everybody--
- I don't know.
- [ Thunderclap ]
[John's Voice ] The same argument
over and over and over again.!
- It's like a broken record.!
- I feel like I'm raising three children and not two.
I'm a child, is that it?
I don't provide for this family?
- I don't bring my money home?
- You're not listening to me!
I don't give you a good life here? Huh?
What are you talking about?
- I can't take it.
- You can't take it anymore?
Then get the hell out.!
[ Tires Screeching ]
[ Phone Ringing ]
Hello.
Yes, this is Mr. Leary.
An accident?
Is she okay?
Where is she?
Is she-- Is she okay?
Well, tell me if she's okay.
Is she okay?
Tell me if my wife is okay.!
Is she okay?
[ Shouting ]
Is she okay?
[ Phone Ringing ]
Jack!Jack!
They found Dylan. He's alive.
Excuse me! Excuse me.
I'm looking for my son.
He was lost, he was found, he's small.
He's down that way
to your right, Mr. Leary.
[ Monitor Beeping ]
Buddy. Hi, buddy.
Are we allowed
to kiss him?
Yeah. Kiss him.
[Jack Narrating ] They found him
in the woods by the Piedmont Reservoir.
Not molested, the doctor said.
Just abandoned,
left to die in the mud by a creek.
I, myself,
would have died of terror...
alone in the woods,
in the night, in the rain...
with monsters all around.
Norman had disappeared
off the face of the Earth...
- and Dylan had stopped talking...
- [ Beeping ]
from the trauma, they said.
After three days
and still no words...
the doctors decided
maybe he should come home...
where familiar objects
might give him security.
We're home.
- Hi.
- Hey, partner.
Oh! Look at that.
- Well, here I am. Where cookies?
- Here are the cookies!
[John ]
Who's that? Is that Big Bird? No.
Who's that? Is that Cookie Monster?
Me want cookie!
Is that Cookie, huh, Dylan?
[ TV]
And now observe as I--
I don't wanna call you Vince! I feel like
you're a teacher if I call you Mr. Buccini!
You have every right
to be upset,Jack.
Then please just leave me alone,
and stop persecuting me!
[Jack Narrating ] I couldn't get back
into the whole school thing.
The place is a mental institution.
But what I didn't understand
is how could a person like me...
who's always been loved,
hate so much?
John.
- I'm so sorry,John.
- Yeah.
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.
How's the baby?
Hi, sweetheart.
You remember Grandma?
We've been sleeping
together in here.
It broke.
[ Grunts ]
That oughta do it.
Goddamn it.
Goddamn it!
[ Whimpering ]
Dylan, I'm not mad at you, honey.
I'm mad at the bed.
- Don't make him afraid of his own bed,John.
- Shut up!
[ Whimpering ]
Dylan. Come to Daddy.
[ Whining ]
John!
John.
Come on.
That's not gonna solve anything.
Where is he?
Where is your son?
- Where is he?
- For God's sake,John!
They're responsible.!
They raised him.! They're guilty.!
Go out of here! He's gone away.
He's gone somewhere else.
Jackie.
My heart's beginning to beat
with the monster's heart.
[ Man Singing ]
[Jack Narrating ] Everything in L.A.
was big and bright, except their house.
It was small and dark,
and Grandpa smelled like it...
or it smelled like him.
[ Man Continues Singing ]
Now, tell me why you did that.
- To get away from your bishop.
- Ah, but look.
You have to be on your guard
every minute,Jack.
The other guy always has a trick
up his sleeve.
Checkmate.
[ Man Continues Singing ]
Tell me why you did that.
- [ Ends ]
- You don't know why?
You just moved
without thinking?
Maybe you should
let me win once.
Let you win? Why?
What would that accomplish?
I don't know.
I'll teach you to win,Jack.
I won't let you win.
That would be wrong.
You'd regret that later on.
You know,
what you moved into...
is called the Devil's Crossroads.
I would take this piece,
and you've got yourself blocked here--
Dad would let me win!
I'm sure he would.
He wouldn't be obvious about it,
but I'd probably know he was doing it.
He'd make a big deal out of it.
He'd protest the game.
He'd yell and moan about it.
He'd tell everyone he was robbed
and demand a rematch.
[ Sighs ]
It would go on for days.
Then I'd like to play chess...
and I would have learned
the Devil's Crossroads because of him.
I'm sorry, Elizabeth.
Just tell me
what I gotta do, Gordon.
Just tell me
what you want me to do, and I'll do it.
You want to change the show, we'll change it.
We'll make it a kiddie show.
- No.
- We'll make it light. We'll make it bright.
- No. No!
- Why not?
- We'll make it a talk show.
- No!
- We'll show cartoons.
-John, no.
- I'll make it a cooking show.
- No!
- Why not?
- Because I don't trust you, that's why.
- You have to trust me.
- Why?
Because I can't lose my kids.
Can he pick up the ticket
at the airport?
Yes, he's flown before.
That's right.
L-E-A-R-Y. One way.
Dylan, I'm going to Dad.
I'm gonna get him.
I'm gonna come back for you, okay?
You'll be okay here
while I'm gone.
Okay?
- Thanks.
- No problem.

things great for Dylan's homecoming...
but I didn't have much faith
in what he could do anymore.

- it's just that I knew now...
there was more than one kind
of monster in the world.
- Hi, Mr. Leary.
- Hey, Dylan. Come on.
- Hi.
- When's the monster coming out?
There's no such things as monsters.
You all know that.
We know.
They're only in our hearts.
[ Boy ] They don't
actually come out into the world.
Not unless a metal light
appears in the sky, right?
No, not even then.
