Welcome to the world of OZ.
OZ is a virtual world that brings
people from around the world together
so they can enjoy themselves.
You can easily access the world of OZ
through your personal computer,
cell phone, or television.
Now let's try experiencing the world of OZ.
First, you'll want to create your avatar.
An avatar is like an OZ version of you.
You can change it any way you want,
from your clothes to your hairstyle.
What a cute-looking avatar.
Your personal information is protected
by the world's most
advanced security system,
so you can relax and enjoy this world.
In the shopping mall, you can find
all kinds of music, movies,
furniture, and anything else.
You can reach out and touch them,
just like experiencing them in real life.
For even greater shopping experiences,
you can visit the specialty stores.
OZ is also home to many of the
high-class fashion shops of the world.
You can even put some of
the clothes from them on your avatar.
But, above all, what is
necessary is communication.
In OZ, all languages
are translated on the fly,
so you can have nice conversations
with people all around the world.
At present, there are
four million different communities.
You can also use your avatar to play sports.
The world of OZ has a full range of
support services for businesses as well.
Corporations throughout the
world have branches in OZ.
You can even set up
your own office inside it.
Many administrative
agencies and local governments
have consultation services in OZ.
Everything from paying taxes
to filing documents can be done here.
Lastly, let's see the guardian
angels of OZ, John and Yoko.
We welcome you to the world of OZ!
Start your fabulous life in OZ today!
Here is the midday
news for Monday, July 26th.
This morning, the
Arawashi asteroid probe left its solar orbit
and entered orbit around Earth.
Although the Arawashi
was plagued with trouble,
it is now on schedule to release its capsule
with samples taken from
the Matogawa asteroid.
Now for our next story...
I was so close to representing Japan...
You're still depressed over that?
Get over it--
--Hey, part-timer! Get back to work!
--Yes, sir...
I was so close...
I'm sick of hearing about it.
You should move on to something new.
Let's choose a theme for this summer!
How about "girls"?!
Summer goes hand-in-hand with
watermelon, fireworks, and girls!
Watermelon and fireworks are enough for me.
--Man, you live a bland life.
--Boring and bland is fine with me.
Hey! Want a part-time job?!
That's what we're doing right now...
--You are?
--We're OZ system maintainers.
You are'? OZ' s'? Wow'.!
No, we're on the very lowest
rung there is, so it's nothing much.
Oh, you're already working... Darn...
If only I could find someone to help me out...
Umm, Natsuki? I can help!
--Really?!
--Hey! What about this job?!
Sorry, I can't after all.
Darn.
It's not even real work; you just have
to take a trip with me to the country...
Okay! I'll do it!
Huh?! You gotta be kidding me!
Th-Then, okay, I'll go too!
I think two might be too many...
I only need one applicant!
" Shor's Factorization Algorithm "
"Getting on the bullet train now."
Oh, Kenji! Over here!
Sorry I'm late!
No, you're right on time.
I doubt Sakuma would have been.
You can count on me!
I'll do whatever you need!
Thanks. You can carry these, then.
--Ueda City in Nagano?
--My great-grandma's having a birthday party.
Relatives from all over Japan
are coming, so we need lots of help.
So, what were you almost
the Japanese representative of?
Huh?!
Sakuma said you were really close
to representing Japan for something.
What was it for?
Uhh, it's called the Math Olympics...
Olympics? Really? For math?
You must be good at it!
Well, it's the only thing I'm okay at, actually...
Really? Do something, then!
Okay... When were you born?
Me? July 19th, 1992.
It was on a Sunday.
July 19th, 1992 was a Sunday.
Wait, do you have it all memorized?
No, I used something
called modular arithmetic...
Was I right?
Sorry. I don't know what
day of the week it was.
Ueda! Ueda!
My great-grandma is turning 90...
She was born in 1920?
She's really living a full life!
Natsuki?
--Natsuki!
--Aunt Noriko!
It's good to see you!
She's the 16th generation
head of the Jinnouchi family.
16th?!
We have family graves dating
back to the Muromachi period.
Our family really hit it big with
our silk business in the Meiji period,
but our late grandfather
was so loose with our money...
--Oh, Aunt Yumi!
--Natsuki!
We're flat broke now!
We don't have anything left,
no mines, no wholesale stores, no factories!
Uh-huh...
But I'm still shocked whenever I see
the New Year's cards
Granny gets every year.
So many famous CEOs and politicians...!
Natsuki!
Nana!
Maybe that's why Granny
sometimes says surprisingly scary things.
It must be the warrior blood in her.
I'd be careful if I were you!
Whoa...
It must've been rough, coming all this way!
--We have some nice, cold watermelon!
--Yay! I love watermelon!
Umm, happy 90th birthday...
It's my mother's birthday...
--Kenji.
--Right!
I know I should've mentioned this before,
but just play along when
we see my great-grandma.
Play along...?
Mother.
Come in.
--Granny!
--You came.
I missed you! Are you all right?
--I'm doing just fine.
--I heard you weren't well lately...
It's just the summer heat.
There's nothing to worry about.
That's good!
Hi.
Remember what I promised?
This is him?
Kenji Koiso.
H-Hello. I'm in the same
physics club at school as Natsuki--
Umm, he's my boyfriend.
Boyfriend...
Yep. My future husband.
Husband...
Yes. My husband.
I see...
See, I told you I'd bring him to see you!
Umm, what exactly is...?
--Kenji.
--Yes?!
She's a somewhat selfish and naive girl.
Are you confident you
can give her happiness?
U-Umm, well... Uhh...
I'm asking if you are prepared or not!
Yes...
You're sure?
Yes, I guess so...
--Even if it costs you your life?
--Huh?!
Yes...
That's great to hear!
Oh, yes.
What is it?
To congratulate you.
Oh, the morning glory yukata!
Thank you!
It is wonderful to meet you, Kenji.
Oh! I-It's a pleasure to m-meet you, too!
I'm sorry!
I can't do it!
Let me go over the job description again.
I can't do it!
I want you to pretend to be my boyfriend
in front of Granny and my relatives.
I can't! I can't! I absolutely can't!
I've never even gone out with a girl before...
I don't want to disappoint her!
I just sort of blurted it out.
I heard she was bed-ridden,
so without thinking,
I told her she can't die until
I bring my boyfriend to see her...
You understand, don't you?
L-I understand...
Thanks!
Then from now on you should
act like we're really close, okay?
Huh?
--You also have a backstory.
“Huh? A backstory?
You go to Tokyo University,
you come from an old family,
and you just came back
from studying in America.
Tokyo University, old family, studying abroad...
--That's the exact opposite of me!
--Got all that?
No, I can't do it after all! I can't!
You said you'd do whatever I want...
Please? Only for four days.
After that, I'll say we broke up.
Please?!
You're getting up there in age, too.
"Jinnouchi Fishery"
Thanks for the lift!
Hey, the helmet!
He misses! And that's the game!
Jinnouchi gives a victory pose!
Who would've thought it?! --I'll go
tell everyone! --Me too! Me too!
--Ryohei won!
--Oh! That's great!
--Go tell Granny!
--Okay! Let's go!
Natsuki! Where are you, Natsuki?!
Shota! Quit stomping around!
Fiancé?! I refuse to accept it, Natsuki!
Damn, I was too slow!
--Ryohei won again!
--He's going to the semifinals!
--That's great!
--Okay! Pre-victory celebration!
What is that?!
Tadah!
“Squid!
"A"d...!
--More squid!
--Great, huh?!
It's all squid...
Umm... Okay, let me introduce you.
First is the main family: Aunt Mariko,
her children Rika and Riichi.
Over here are Uncle Mansuke,
Tasuke, and Naomi.
This is Kiyomi and Tasuke's son Shota.
Over here is Uncle Mansaku,
who has three sons.
There's Yorihiko and his wife Noriko,
Kunihiko and his wife Nana,
and Katsuhiko, his wife Yumi,
and their sons Yuhei and Kyohei.
And this is Nana's daughter Kana,
and Noriko's children Shingo and Mao.
Got all that?
Oh, uhh, I'm not sure...
Well, for now...
--it's good to meet you!
--l-it's good to meet you all...
It's amazing that Granny gave him the okay!
She drove away every
boy I ever brought home!
But he goes to Tokyo U., comes
from an old family, and studied abroad!
Talk about being well-rounded!
Yeah, almost sounds too good to be true!
--Your Singles Club should be taking notes!
--Oh, be quiet!
--I'm single because I want to be!
--My divorce wasn't my fault!
So, future husband. When is it due?
Huh?
You know, your kid.
What in the world are you
talking about, you dirty old man?!
He only came to say hello!
Huh? But that basically means,
"Me and Natsuki did it," right?
Am I wrong? You're in college, right?
You still haven't done it?
Knock it off!
C'mon, it's okay. He's gonna be a
part of the family soon enough. Right?
Part of the family, my butt!
I refuse to accept it!
--Be quiet, Shota!
--You shut up!
How dare you talk to your father that way!
I've watched Natsuki since she was this little!
Since she was that little?
And she doesn't even ask me,
her second cousin, for approval!
Yes, second cousins are so close!
Still...!
Mother's approval is the only thing that matters.
That's how things work in this family.
You really gave your approval, Granny?!
Of course.
Kenji will be a great member of the family.
My eyes never deceive me.
The Jinnouchi family has
no need for mediocre men
who aren't able to protect
our family and homeland!
That's right! Jinnouchi men need to be strong!
The Jinnouchi clan was originally
a part of the all-powerful Takeda army!
Here he goes...
But when the Takeda collapsed,
all the clans under them broke up.
So the entire careers
we built up instantly vanished.
After we came to Ueda,
we fought countless battles to protect it,
despite its small size.
In 1585, 2,000 of our ancestors
fought 7,000 elite Tokugawa soldiers!
--Thus began the First Ueda Conflict!
--Yes!
The Tokugawa managed to reach
the second enclosure of the castle!
But our ancestors didn't falter!
Using their knowledge of the land,
they fought back and drove them all--
Using their knowledge of the land,
they fought back and drove them all--
Turn around.
Man, why did I have to lose
rock-paper-scissors to you...
I'm so jealous.
You get to be her boyfriend...
There's nothing to be jealous about.
This is work.
So, are you having fun?
I'm not good with being
surrounded by strangers.
Don't be like that!
You're sharing the same roof
with the most popular girl at school!
Since you're playing her boyfriend,
have her sleep next to you!
Wh-What?! I can't do that!
Well, good luck!
Huh? Where am I?
Man, this place is big...
--You want something?
“Oh, um, I'm lost...
“The bathroom's back and to the right.
--Th-Thanks.
You're not going to join everyone else?
Mommy!
You need to dry off first, Kana.
S-Sorry!
Oh, the bath's open now. You can use it.
No, I, uhh, think I'll pass tonight...
Natsuki was in this bath...
It's a tie...
It's me, Hayate.
Don't you remember me?
Why are you here?
What are you talking about?
This is my house.
The hell it is!
You're still as harsh as ever, Aunt Mariko.
You haven't changed in ten years.
You're the one who hasn't changed!
Suddenly showing up out of nowhere...
What's with your attitude?!
Why is the whole family here?
Her birthday party is on Sunday.
Whose'?
Wabisuke.
Wabisuke?
Hey, Ol' hag. You're still alive?
Likewise. I assumed you
had died in a gutter by now.
Sounds like you'll be past
100 before you kick the bucket.
Have you... eaten?
I don't need any of your food.
Japan's one lousy place.
It's always humid, the streets are
all narrow, and it's crowded as hell.
But it definitely has good beer.
Uncle...
Uncle Wabisuke!
Natsuki? Is that you?
I'm so happy! You came back!
--Natsuki!
--Get away from him!
What? Why? He's--
--it's been ten years already.
--Time flies.
Umm, who is Wabisuke?
--Oh, right, you've never met him.
--It's kind of complicated.
Complicated how?
He was adopted into the main family.
Basically, he's great-grandpa's illegitimate son.
Huh?!
It happened a lot back then.
He had the nerve to sell
what little Granny had left
and the nerve to run off
with the money to America!
He's got some nerve, basically!
Really? You aren't married yet?
Do you have a girlfriend, then?
Don't ask dumb stuff like that.
That's great! I'll come
visit America sometime!
Take me to the Disney resort!
First the one in California, then Florida!
And I can stay at your place!
Tell me how I can contact you.
--Only if you win.
--Awe, cheapskate!
It's more fun that way.
Okay, then!
Oh! I got a 3 Bright! All right!
--Are you going to collect your points?
--Hmm...
Not yet. Koi Koi!
Oh, okay. Then it's my turn...
Urgh...
--Trying for a 4 Bright, huh?
--N-No...!
Oh, too bad!
Three junk cards.
--Huh?! You're not going to call Koi Koi?!
--Nope.
You can't be serious!
I win. Brush your teeth and get to bed, kid.
No! Let's play again!
I'm a firm believer of running
away with your winnings.
--Tap.
--Oh, I still don't know the rules...
Hey, how long are you here for?
Dunno.
You should stay! What do you say?
Hmm...
What am I doing?
What is this?
I solved it!
What was that?
Now let's see here...
"Get up!
"Get up!
Get UP, you!
Get up!
{\an8}<i>The damage seems to be spreading, but...</i>
What? What? What? What?
What? What? What? What?
What?
Look.
See, it's the same face.
There's no doubt about it.
It's him.
{\an8}<i>Please take another look at the picture.</i>
{\an8}<i>He looks quite young.</i>
{\an8}<i>Is he a student?</i>
Th-That's...
Th-That's...
Th-That's...
Me!
<i>Surprisingly, this young man managed to infiltrate the internal system of OZ.</i>
{\an8}<i>Current state of OZ</i>
<i>He threw all of OZ into chaos in one night.</i>
<i>It appears that it'll still take a bit more time to restore the system.</i>
<i>He's a hacker.</i>
<i>It's been really inconvenient for me without my email.</i>
<i>I mean, the usage statistics for OZ are almost identical to the diffusion rate of cell phones.</i>
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>Shopping, official activities, and business fund transfers...</i>
<i>Basically, our lives are based around our OZ accounts,</i>
<i>so even if it was only a small part that was disrupted, we can't forgive him.</i>
Yes, so true.
Maybe he likes getting eaten.
What's so funny?
It's breakfast.
Hey!
Come back!
Give it back!
Hacker! Hacker!
It's not me!
Please give it back to me!
Try and get it.
Please give it back to me!
Try and get it.
I-It's not...
Hacker!
What?
It's breakfast!
--Unable to access the network--
huh?
--Unable to access the network--
Huh?!
Why?!
Where was it, um...
There you are!
Did you do this?
Hey, can I use your laptop?
Not with the way you're asking.
Ask me like you're asking a business partner.
W-Would you be so kind as to allow me to use your laptop?
Thanks!
Why?
What are you flustered about?
My account's been stolen.
Oh.
It wasn't you.
What should I do...?
Contact the support center.
That's it!
Hello?
We cannot confirm your OZ account, and cannot connect you to the support line.
I-It's not working!
It's not working!
Calm down.
Koiso?
Calm down...
You have a call from Tokyo.
Someone named Sakuma.
Don't tell me you were behind this!
--No!
I didn't think so.
You don't have the motive or the guts.
If you already know, then do something!
Can't. Our passwords were changed.
We can't get into the admin building.
Isn't OZ supposed to have
the world's best security?!
A weird e-mail was
sent all over OZ yesterday.
A weird e-mail?!
OZ is protected by a 2,056-digit security code.
It'd be tough to break,
but someone did it in one night!
2,056 digits? What was the first number?!
Eight.
It was me... I did it...
What?!
--I thought it was just some math problem, so...
--You solved it?! You idiot!
I'm sorry!
Whoa...
Anyway, I registered a guest avatar
using the phone number there.
It doesn't have any privileges,
but it's better than nothing.
Use it to figure out what's going on!
This... is me?
This is a message from OZ.
A number of services are currently offline.
U-Umm, excuse me...!
C-Could you please stop
causing trouble with my avatar?
This person isn't me!
He took over my account!
Who in the world is he?!
Wh-What's so fun about
causing trouble like this?!
You're sorely mistaken if you think
you can do anything you want online!
Battle mode?!
But that shouldn't be enabled in this area!
This is bad! Collision detection
rules have been completely rewritten!
Which means...?
All of OZ is a battle coliseum now!
Run!
Umm, let's talk this over!
Let's talk this over!
Defense!
What are you doing?! Give me that!
That's...
...King Kazma!
Whoa... I didn't know you were...
Don't talk to me.
You'll break my concentration.
You got him!
This guy's nothing at all.
There he is! I've located the criminal!
Okay! Let's arrest him!
You're under arrest!
Stop!
--He...
--...changed...
Damn! Damn! Damn!
This guy's-J
--Are you playing a game?
--Lemme play!
Don't touch!
KO!
Challenger wins!
Oh!
That was close...
He almost took your account too...
Here we go!
Ready, start!
P Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday to you! P
Come sing with us, Uncle Wabisuke!
I'll pass.
Forget about him.
Uncle.
What are you looking at?
--A woman with big boobs.
--What did you do in America?
--I was a ninja.
--Really?!
I think I know who's behind this now!
Not human?!
What do you mean it's not human?!
It's an A.l. An artificial intelligence.
Apparently a prototype
hacking A.l. under development
escaped from a robotics school in Pittsburgh.
Escaped?
It's called the "Love Machine."
Love Machine?
I wish he'd give us a break already.
You can say that again. I can't even use
my cell phone now. I hope they fix it soon.
Let's go to the hot springs if Ryohei
makes it to the national tournament!
--I'll pay!
--That sounds great!
Huh? Haven't I seen him before?
Natsuki! What's going on here?!
Break up with him this minute!
I searched OZ's registry
just now and guess what?!
He's not from an old family!
He's the son of an average office worker!
And he's in high school!
He's younger than you!
We just got this fax at the station! Look!
Tokyo University, my butt!
And he never studied in America!
U-Umm, well...
And now for our next news story.
The Arawashi asteroid probe failed
to release its capsule as scheduled.
"King Kazma, King of the Wimps!!"
"You betrayed us, Kazma!"
I don't like games.
I just like to compete to win.
Oh...
But he's different. He likes games. I can tell.
Which would mean his goal is...
There he is!
There he is!
They found out the truth...
Well, Saku Chosei High is really tough,
but I think we can win the championship!
Let's go, Ueda High!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Huh?
Why did you lie like that? Do you
think Granny will be happy about this?!
I was suspicious of his story
from the moment I heard it.
Though we actually do
have a Tokyo U. graduate
from an old family
who's back from America...
--Oh, now that you mention it, Wabisuke...
--You're right! But why...?
Hold on. Wasn't Natsuki's first love...?
Oh!
Yeah! She's always been
especially close to Wabisuke!
She even had her love fortune
told when she was in kindergarten...
And she wrote an essay called,
"My Uncle and I."
No! No more! Forget everything!
I see! So that's why...
Never mind that! Shouldn't you be
concerned that this guy's a criminal?!
--That's right.
--We can't let him stay with us.
You're a cop.
Why don't you take him in?
Oh, right.
All right, you!
--Whoa...
--it's a real-life arrest!
Don't look!
The time is 12:30. You're charged with, uhh...
Is that really you on the news?
I don't really know what's
happening or who's being troubled.
But is that really you in that photograph?
--I'm innocent.
--Save your excuses for the station!
Hey, you!
Umm, even after everything that's happened,
I want to say that
I really enjoyed my time here.
"Huh?!
“Be quiet!
My father works away from home,
and my mother's so busy with her
job that it's usually just me at home.
Eating dinner and
playing cards together in a big group...
I've never really had such
a lively experience before.
It made me happy---
Anyway, I thank you very much.
Thank you all very much, too.
--Bye!
--Thank you, too!
Natsuki...
Natsuki...!
--At the top of the 4th, Jinnouchi of Ueda High
still hasn't given up a hit! “Come on, no-hitter!
He nods. Now he winds up, and...
Huh?!
Oh, uhh, and now for
an emergency news update.
Enough with the dumb Arawashi!
--Yumi.
--Yes?!
We're going to have a lot of visitors today.
We're going to be really busy.
Help out, okay?
Okay!
I see this isn't a patrol car...
--Shut up!
--Sorry.
“Hey!
“Yes?!
It's green! Why aren't we moving?!
Sorry!
Huh? What do you mean you won't be here?
I think the navigation system's broken...
I'm in Saitama but it says I'm in Hokkaido.
And the traffic's really bad.
I have no idea when I'll be there...
Don't give me that!
Her birthday's the day after tomorrow!
Don't worry! My husband will take
the bullet train tonight, so tell Natsuki.
Can he do it?! He hits it into the infield!
He rushes to first! He's safe!
Sorry, I don't think I'll
be able to leave Tokyo today...
You, too?! Why not?!
Apparently someone's been
messing with the water pressure.
At this rate, the gas and power lines
underground will be in danger too...
I promise I'll take a bullet train
tomorrow, so let Natsuki know.
You have to come! We've already
scheduled everything in advance!
A successful sacrifice bunt! He's safe!
Emergency vehicle coming through!
You can't come home? Why not?
All the senior citizens are pressing
their emergency buttons non-stop.
But it can't be for real...
What? In Suwa too?
We responded to the alarm,
but there isn't any fire here at all.
It's been like this all morning!
But I thought you had the night shift?
But we have to check it out, just in case.
I bet it's just another false alarm though.
My boat arrived in a different port?
Nagoya's in chaos too?
Can't you make it anyway?
Kazuma's waiting for you...
You turned back? At Sendai?
Bathroom? Oh, that's probably for the best.
Yeah, don't worry about me.
Got it. I'll tell Aunt Mariko.
Hey, Uncle Kazutoshi in Matsuyama is...
--Foul ball! Bases loaded with no outs!
--Huh?
Why can't anyone come?! What's going on?!
Jinnouchi is in a tough spot now!
Damn it! What's going on?!
Lunch break's about to end!
Come back!
The traffic jam's 60 kilometers long!
I'm only doing this because
Natsuki asked, just so you know!
What's happening?
--Could be terrorists.
--Huh?
Welcome back!
Huh? Why are you back?
Sorry, I have to...
Did you forget something?
No, I just...
Listen! Don't use the boat's GPS.
Tell the fishing association too.
Weren't Yorihiko and the others
going to do a ladder performance for us'?
I don't think they have the time for that.
I ordered all those red and
white steamed buns for everyone, too...
Who knows if they'll even arrive or not...
Give me a break! You branch
members haven't lifted a finger
while we've been preparing all morning!
It's obvious the Love Machine is behind it.
It can steal as many accounts
as it wants using that password.
--Accounts?
--People's IDs inside OZ.
You can do pretty much
anything in OZ nowadays,
so accounts have basically the same
privileges as their owners in real life.
Steal the water department chief's account
and you can control the water system;
steal a JR employee's account and
you can mess with the train schedules.
There are over a billion registered users.
Institutions all over the world
use OZ accounts to run now.
OZ's advanced security
capabilities are working against us now.
Exactly.
If it takes the president's account, it might
even be able to launch nuclear missiles.
It's all my fault...
Y-You're under arrest after all!
All this traffic is proving daunting
for emergency vehicles. All drivers...
This is almost like we're
being attacked by an enemy.
Ah enemy?
If we're not careful, people might die.
Ambulance #5.
Huh? Granny?!
Why are you calling this reserved line?
Yorihiko! Cheer up and visit
as many seniors as you can!
Got that?!
Kunihiko! Don't lose heart!
Show the world what you're made of!
Listen, Katsuhiko! This is a war!
I'm going to do what I can too!
What do you mean? Huh?
Kan? This is Sakae.
We haven't spoken since Nori's funeral.
Seeing as both of our families
served under the Takeda family,
I thought I'd ask what the Ministry of
Infrastructure is doing to handle this.
What? You were just thinking of
doing something? Don't give me that!
Sone. Even retired doctors will do.
I'd like you to call as many
medical professionals as you can
and have them assist the fire department.
This is the chance for your idiot
son's NPO to actually help the world!
Iitomi. What's most important
is that people communicate
and talk to one another, like in the old days.
Surely you understand
that more than anyone else.
Sen. It all rests on your decision.
Yes, it'll require a lot of manpower.
But people's lives can't be replaced!
Oh, don't be like that. Just consider
it an old woman's simple request.
Don't bring up those old times, Naki.
It was over half a century ago that I hit you.
Thousands of people are in need of help.
If you don't do your best now, when will you?
Don't give up.
That's the most important thing.
This is something only you can do.
I know you can do it!
You can!
Yes! That's the spirit!
That was the metro police
commissioner she was just talking to!
Whoa...
She's cheering everyone on...
Am I hard of hearing?
Don't give me that!
Did you remember to put your dentures in?!
Don't treat me like a feeble old woman!
All of OZ's engineers are
working on the situation,
but we still can't get into the admin building.
Type in a random number.
If you enter an incorrect password,
a code gets displayed.
This is a code?
I know you can do it!
You can!
Who is this guy?
The Japanese representative
at the Math Olympics.
Almost, anyway.
Got it!
You got in!
--Great news, Kenji!
--Huh?
According to the gate security logs,
55 people around the world
broke the code last night.
But you aren't on that list!
Wh-Why not?
You got the last letter wrong! Ha ha!
Damn. You're not a criminal after all?
But everyone who replied
had their avatars stolen.
But cheer up! You did solve this latest one!
...a chaotic day nationwide,
but miraculously there were no deaths...
...similar problems throughout the
world were caused by system errors
resulting from the
spontaneous generation of accounts.
However, some reports continue to state
that the unauthorized use of OZ
accounts is technologically impossible...
It's now the tenth day of the
Nagano High School Baseball Tournament...
Quiet, everyone!
After a long, arduous game,
Ueda High managed to defeat Saku Chosei
and advance to tomorrow's finals!
All right!
I'm amazed they won after allowing 30 hits!
It's a miracle!
Yeah, whenever he's about
to lose you can see it written on his face...
--Like father, like son!
--Huh?
Natsuki. Where are your parents?
My dad's working all night fixing pipes.
My mom's still in Saitama.
She said she's going to stay at
a business hotel because she's tired.
Glad to hear they're okay.
It wouldn't have been resolved so quickly
if Granny hadn't given orders to everyone!
Right, Granny?
I didn't give any orders to anyone.
Oh, you're such a kidder!
--You're great, Granny!
--Greatest in all Japan!
You're so silly!
Kenji. I hear you worked very hard today.
No, I didn't really do much...
--Natsuki's boyfriend?
--He's not her boyfriend!
Apparently he fixed the problems with OZ!
He's still only in high school, too!
--Way to go, boyfriend!
--He's not her boyfriend!
Why do you care?
Concerning the issues
that plagued OZ this morning...
Although the system was restored,
the accounts of at least
two million people throughout
Japan are presently unusable.
As the cause is unknown,
the Ministry of Communications is warning...
--Wh at now?
--OZ.
...or use of accounts.
--But we still haven't...
--...beaten the Love Machine.
--Exactly.
--Love Machine?
What's that? Like the song?
An A.l. that steals accounts.
Let me see!
--That's a mean-looking avatar...
--It definitely looks like a bad guy...
This guy was behind everything today?
But why isn't it being reported?
I think it's only a matter of time, Master.
The online world is huge,
and people who've noticed
him are already taking action.
If we work together and share info,
we should be able to stop him.
Sorry to break it to you, but that won't work.
How do you know it won't work?!
How do I know?
Because I developed him.
You created the Love Machine?
Yeah. It's a hacking A.l. I developed.
All I did was one thing:
give a machine the desire to learn.
I gave it a thirst for knowledge, in other words.
Then some military officials
showed up and asked to buy it for a lot
depending on how experiments with it went.
I never imagined they'd
use OZ for the experiment.
But as you can see, the results are tremendous.
It's constantly gathering information
and privileges throughout the world,
exactly how its instincts tell it.
Just one of him is equal
to an army of millions now.
Understand?
That's why you can't beat him.
Do you know how many
people were affected today?
Do you know how much
trouble you caused society?!
You're blaming me?
Don't be silly. The A.l. did it.
It's the reason the world
is all screwed up now!
You just don't get it. The A.l...
--You can't talk your way out of this!
--Stop, Katsu!
--Don't act like nothing's happened, dammit!
--Stop it!
I only developed the artificial intelligence!
I didn't tell it to do any of this!
--Maybe so, but...!
--Stop it! Not in front of Granny!
Wabisuke...
--What's all the shouting about?
--Shh!
Granny. You understand, don't you?
I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused.
I worked really hard to try to redeem myself.
I wanted to be able to come
back home filled with pride...
Look at this, Granny.
I just got an official offer from the U.S. Army.
We're about to be even richer
than when Gramps was alive!
And it's all thanks to you.
The money you gave me allowed
me to develop it on my own.
Mother!
Run!
Wabisuke! You deserve to die right here!
I shouldn't have come back.
Uncle!
Natsuki!
All right, everyone! Let's clean up
after our family member's misstep!
Natsuki...
Natsuki...
Stay away. I have too
much to deal with right now...
These legs of mine refuse to listen to me...
You did overexert yourself.
Thank you...
Well, I should get back to cleaning.
Tell me, do you know how to play Hanafuda?
We used to play as a family, but
I have so few people to play with now...
You can go first.
Okay.
That was a very embarrassing
family incident earlier..
Not at all...
Not to mention Natsuki's foolishness...
--Koi Koi.
--You're good.
Thank you.
--Hmm, if I win this match...
--Huh?
It wouldn't be very fun without a wager...
--Okay! Koi Koi!
"Okay...
Okay, then if I win...
...please take good care of her.
She's the kind of foolish girl who'd ask
someone to pretend to be her fiance,
but if you can accept that, then I'll ask again.
Please take good care of Natsuki.
I... I'm still not confident of myself...
I know you can do it.
I'll try. That's all I can say for now.
I win.
--Mansaku! Hurry!
--I'm coming!
Hurry!
Granny! Wake up! Granny...!
--Let me do it.
--That's enough.
--No, Katsuhiko! Keep trying!
--It's no use.
Keep trying!
Looks like everyone's here.
5:21.
She had angina. She was taking nitrates for it.
I was using this to monitor her health.
Pulse, blood pressure, perspiration...
An alarm was supposed to go
off the minute anything changed.
But her data stopped being sent last night...
The OZ trouble...
Someone who worked on the system
must've had their account stolen...
Then she could've survived
if things had been normal?!
No, it might've been her time...
Damn! I refuse to accept this!
Where's Wabisuke?!
I'm gonna find and strangle him!
Apparently he left in Shota's car last night.
He was away for ten whole years.
No one knows how to contact him.
Damn!
Sorry. Sorry.
Stop them...
My tears...
Hold me here...
Stop them...
And now for our next story.
Ten million users worldwide
are unable to use their accounts
as a result of the OZ-related
trouble that began yesterday--
Did you tell Ryohei?
We should wait until after
his championship game today.
Yeah...
We're going to be busy today.
Noriko, Yumi, Nana.
You're in charge of the kitchen.
I hope we'll have enough saké for the wake.
Mansaku, go make
arrangements with the temple.
Yorihiko and the others,
contact the neighborhood association
and commerce association.
Decide who'll be the organizer.
Everyone got that?
Isn't there something
more important to do first?!
That's right, Mom!
The red and white steamed buns!
Oh, I need to switch them to funeral buns!
I'm not talking about the buns!
I mean revenge! We have to destroy
that Whatever-it's-called Machine!
--You're unbelievable!
--What?!
Second sons really are useless!
That's got nothing to do with it!
The Jinnouchi family has always
hoisted its flag high, no matter what!
Don't be silly, Dad!
We're about to have Granny's funeral!
Are you kidding me?! Fighting would
be the best way to honor her memory!
Umm...
I agree.
I never imagined that the OZ incident
would end up taking someone's life.
He's dangerous.
Incidents like yesterday and this
morning could happen again anywhere.
We need to stop him,
even if we have to on our own.
Huh?! What nonsense is that?!
We need to prevent any more of this--!
How can you say such stupid
things in another family's home?!
B-But...
Why should we worry about others
when we're having a crisis of our own?!
But...
Okay, everyone!
I can't believe them...
And they call themselves
members of the Jinnouchi family?!
I understand how you feel.
But you should act more mature, Dad.
Like you're anyone to talk.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said anything...
No, you were right. "You have
to protect others to protect yourself."
Is that the Self Defense Force's motto?
No, it's from "Seven Samurai."
Uncle Tasuke.
--Do you sell computers at your store?
--Of course.
--Do you have anything better than this?
--Of course.
Kazuma...
I want to know how to fight him.
I want a rematch.
Sheesh, how can Mansuke
do that at a time like this?
--It's surprisingly hard to find one...
--Hey! How about this one?
Oh, that's when the
governor gave her a medal!
Perfect!
In 1600, a 38,000-man army
led by Tokugawa Hidetada
invaded Ueda-Chiisagata.
We only had 2,000 men to fend them off.
So, what did our ancestors do?
They provoked the enemy, lured them
into the castle's second enclosure,
then closed the gates and used
the surrounding town to fence them in.
Thrown into chaos and completely helpless,
the Tokugawa army lost
the will to fight and retreated.
That was the strategy behind
the Second Ueda Conflict.
--Is that any help?
--We'll use that idea!
Okay, then that's the plan.
Hello, Sakuma?
What are you up to now?
We're going into battle.
How about this for the pillowside decoration?
I don't know. Seems good to me.
She died looking very nice...
You can say that again.
Man, I hope this'll fit...
You sell stuff like this too?!
My local electronics shop
is only a side business.
Most of my orders are from
government offices and schools.
This one's going to a university, in fact.
Is it okay for us to be using it?!
Don't worry about it! We're just borrowing it!
But why did you suddenly...?
Kenji. You stood up to
Aunt Mariko and the others earlier.
I bet Kazuma's changed his mind about you.
The women in this family are usually
the ones in charge; the men are weak.
Now, where's an outlet...
Make way!
Nice boat, huh?! I rushed it
here from Niigata in two hours!
It can supply up to 300 kilowatts!
Whoops, almost forgot! It's water-cooled!
Whoa...
What is that?
An EHF transmission antenna module.
I borrowed it from the
military garrison in Matsumoto.
What part of the
Self Defense Force do you work in, Riichi?
Some place I can't name.
Are all the men in our family idiots?!
--The funeral car is here and it has an antenna!
“The ship is full of light bulbs!
Quiet down!
Behave yourselves, okay?
Okay...
Is it okay for us to sit around like this?
We're in mourning. Just stay put.
--Three days is a long time.
--I feel guilty. I keep thinking about work.
--Forget about work.
--I can't.
Granny did always tell
us to be helpful to people.
Yeah.
Everyone! Please listen!
Oh, this is good!
We could really use your help, Naomi.
I can't, this is too good.
Oh, what time is it?!
It's about to start!
Yumi!
--Kazuma! Your change of clothes!
--Later.
Kazuma almost seems like King Kazma.
He doesn't look like it,
but he used to get bullied a lot.
Huh?
His Grandpa Mansuke taught
him Shaolin martial arts through OZ.
So that's why he calls him "Master."
Don't touch that! I mean it!
--We aren't touching it.
--We're just looking.
Cooling is the main issue.
This house doesn't have an air conditioner.
There's plenty of ice on the boat!
Lend me a hand!
LCDs have too much response time.
Do you have any HD CRT monitors?
Sure do!
--What kind of house is that?!
--A normal one.
A 200 teraflops supercomputer
with a 100 GHz EHF connection...
Those are not normal specs!
--We want to issue a challenge.
--A challenge?
From King Kazma. "I'm nothing
like the King Kazma I was before."
Why would you say that?
Because I'm King Kazma.
That's funny.
Seriously?
Master.
Can I beat him?
You're an adult. It's up to
you whether you win or lose.
--I'm an adult? But I'm in junior high...
--You're about to be a big brother, right?
Not by choice.
I didn't ask to have a sister...
Having siblings isn't so bad.
You get half the snacks, you fight a lot,
and the very sight of them annoys you!
One minute to go!
All set!
Ready here!
Win this time!
Give it your all!
Let's do it.
Ueda High faces the
indomitable Matsusho Academy
after a long, hard struggle this year
to reach the championship game!
If they win, they'll be in the national
tournament for the first time in 24 years!
Matsusho is tough, though.
They'll have to play their very best here.
Watch over Ryohei, Granny!
It's time for the game to get underway!
He came!
All right!
He's really fast...!
I can do this...!
--Don't let him get away!
--Lure him to the spot!
I can beat him myself!
--He's controlling stolen avatars!
--He can do that?!
Oh, no! Get out of there, Kazuma!
--Master!
--Use this chance to run!
--Master!
--Just lure him to the spot!
--He fell for it!
--Sakuma!
Exactly as planned!
We did it, Granny! Kazuma got him!
Yorihiko! You guys are up!
Yeah! Leave it to us!
Don't underestimate our
30 years of playing games!
I haven't played much lately,
but I think I'll unleash some
serious moves for old times' sake!
Yes!
Is that Dad's avatar?
--Yeah.
--I want this one too!
--Daddy's so cool!
--Cool!
It's the bottom of the 8th! Ueda High
scores three runs to take the lead!
Yumi!
He's trapped like a rat.
Now it's just a matter of-
Wh-What is this?!
Huh?! Something's wrong with the stage!
What's going on?!
“Behind you, Tasuke!
“Behind?
What is it?
Oww! Hot!
--It's overheating!
--What?!
What happened to all the ice?!
There was so much of it!
Shota carried it away.
What?!
There. Does that feel cooler, Granny?
Apparently today's the hottest day on record!
It's the bottom of the 9th with two outs,
and Jinnouchi is suddenly flustered!
Yes, things are looking strange.
--This batting lineup
isn't showing him any mercy.
"Ryohei! --This batting lineup
isn't showing him any mercy.
--This batting lineup
isn't showing him any mercy.
"Could it be the heat? --This batting
lineup isn't showing him any mercy.
--Natsuki...
--It could be.
--...come help me make a list of guests.
--It could be.
--...come help me make a list of guests. --He's been
pitching non-stop; he's likely running out of stamina.
--He's been pitching non-stop;
he's likely running out of stamina.
Yes, it's very worrying.
Ueda High's desperate situation continues!
--Matsusho Academy is on the offensive!
--Natsuki!
These are all the avatars that were absorbed!
Over 400 million!
Kazuma! Run! Kazuma!
You kids are just sittin' here, playing games
while Granny's about
to start rotting in this heat?!
It's your fault...
Huh? What was that?
It's your fault!
--It's all your fault!
--Stop, Kazuma!
What the hell?!
Are you okay, Shota?
Nothing good's happened
since you came here!
First, Natsuki's an idiot!
Then Granny dies! Then Kazuma slugs me!
Shota...
--Wh-What is this?!
--Huh?
The World Clocks...
They're going crazy...
What's... it counting down to?
Wh-Why is it showing nuclear reactors...?
This is bad.
Alarms are going off across the
U.S. Army's confidential network.
Japan's Arawashi asteroid probe
is out of control and plummeting to Earth...
What?!
The Arawashi can hit any given
location using GPS guidance!
If he's controlling the Arawashi...!
Then this countdown is...?!
The time left until the Arawashi hits
one of the 500-plus nuclear
facilities throughout the world...
"The world might end!!" "Someone help!!" one of the
500-plus nuclear facilities throughout the world...
On top of that, he already pitched
for fifteen innings in yesterday's game.
--How much does he have left in him?
--Ryohei!
"To my family--
Read if something happens to me"
H-Hold on, Natsuki!
Natsuki! Wait! What are you doing?
Everyone!
A game? You call the
end of mankind a game?!
You can't be serious...
This is just a game to him.
It's not doing this out of want or hate.
Sounds like the U.S. Army is in chaos too.
They never anticipated that a
simple experiment would lead to this.
An object one meter in diameter
reentering at 7 kilometers per second
is as powerful as
a meteor or a ballistic missile.
If it hits a reactor and scatters
radioactive material over a wide area,
the damage would be unfathomable.
What do we do, then?
There's no way we can take
back 400 million OZ accounts!
But there's no other way...
Kazuma...
What's happening?
This isn't real, right?
It's just part of a game, right?
No, King!
--You don't stand a chance!
--Shut up!
Granny... I'm sorry...
I couldn't protect Mom... or my sister...!
The only person who can do anything now...
...is Wabisuke. But...
...I don't think...
...he'll come back...
We haven't lost yet.
Kenji...
We have lost.
No, we haven't.
We lost!
No, we haven't yet!
There's gotta be something else we can do.
Yeah, sure! This isn't math, you know!
It's the same idea.
If you give up, you'll never solve anything.
You'll never get the answer.
Are you...?
Natsuki!
How did you get this address, Natsuki?
--Where are you?
--What does it matter?
How did you figure out my phone's password?
Come back.
Granny put you up to this, didn't she?
Just listen.
I'm never going back.
Not as long as she's living there.
Please, just listen...
I wouldn't have come back
if I'd known it was her birthday.
Uncle...
--I'm not going--
--You don't even know what's going on!
--What are you talking about?
--Great-grandma Sakae is dead.
She had a weak heart.
Uncle Mansaku couldn't help
her because of all the OZ trouble!
Granny's... Granny's dead?
You lied! You didn't forget her birthday!
Your password was "August 1st"!
You came here to see her! I know you did!
Please! Come back and say goodbye!
To my family...
First, just relax.
It's always important to stay calm.
Make my funeral a quick one,
with only those close to us,
and then go on with your normal lives.
I don't have an inheritance to leave behind,
but I'm certain all of my old
acquaintances will be helpful to you,
so there's nothing to worry about.
Please continue to work hard.
And...
And, when Wabisuke comes back...
it's been ten years since he left,
so I don't know when he'll return,
but if he ever does, I'm sure
he'll be hungry so let him eat
all the vegetables, grapes,
and peaches in our fields he wants.
I remember the day I first met him very well.
I was shocked by the way his
ears looked just like my husband's.
While we walked through
the field of morning glories,
I told him he would be a member
of our family from that day forward.
He didn't say anything,
but he never let go of my hand.
I think my happiness of bringing him
into the family got through to him.
Remember, never let go
of fellow family members...
Never let life get the best of you...
And you always eat together as
a family, even during difficult times...
Because being hungry and being all alone
are the worst things that
can happen to anyone...
I am very happy to have
lived with all of you by my side.
"Thank you. Goodbye."
Uncle!
Granny! Granny!
Wabisuke. Go and see Granny.
Then we can all sit down and eat together.
Come on, Ryohei!
--Huh?
--Come on, Yumi!
Awe! But the game's not over yet!
I'm back, Granny.
It's trying to cause a
nuclear explosion?! That's terrible!
--Yeah, things are looking bad.
--Should we really be eating?!
It was her dying wish.
The enemy's really strong, right?!
We helped take on the huge
Tokugawa army of 150,000 soldiers
during the Osaka
Summer Campaign of 1615.
But didn't we lose?
It isn't about fighting if you'll
win or not fighting if you'll lose.
Our family fights losing battles all the time.
What an idiotic family!
Yes. And we're their descendants.
That's true. I'm one of those idiots.
But... you have a plan, right?!
I'm going to dismantle him remotely.
But it's only a 50%
chance we'll make it in time.
It all boils down to the fact
that he steals accounts.
So how can we steal
them back more efficiently?
Efficiently?
--You said he likes games, right?
--Huh?
This is the answer!
One hour left!
Welcome to the OZ Casino Stage.
Do you want accounts that badly?!
Then I'll give you mine.
But only if you can beat me!
Japanese Hanafuda selected.
Please place your bet.
I bet...
...my family!
I bet all of our accounts!
Okay! Your accounts are in my hands, guys!
Watch over her, Granny!
It's just like our family
to fight using Hanafuda...
Wabisuke. Work on dismantling it in parallel!
Will it accept, though?
There's only 20 of us, including Sakuma.
That's not much of a bet...
Be quiet! We're talking about our lives here!
--Fight her!
--Yeah! Take her on!
--It will accept.
--Definitely.
A challenger has appeared.
This is it!
Win, Natsuki! The fate of
the world is resting on you!
Casino rules apply to this stage.

Natsuki calls Koi Koi.
Dry 3 Bright. Will you call Koi Koi?

Natsuki's amazing...
She's already freed over 300,000 avatars!
But she still hasn't taken an
account that can avert this crisis!
Wabisuke!
--Viewing the Cherry Blossoms.
--Oh no!
Unknown did not call Koi Koi. Natsuki loses.

"To Natsuki-- Please use my account."
Whoa!
13.837% of all the accounts have
gathered! Over 150 million in all!
--Why are there so many?
--It must be because Natsuki's so pretty!
"Please protect our family."
Wh-What happened?!
OZ's guardian angels granted
Natsuki an auspicious rare item!
--I don't really understand, but...
--Thank you!
Unknown has raised the rate.

We...
We...
We did it! We did it!
Natsuki!
Kenji...
I... l...
I did it!
N-Natsuki! Whoa...!
Wait! Somethings not right!
The countdown is still going!
What?!
That can't be! It's stopped
everywhere else in the world!
It's only here?!
What?!
--It's going to drop the Arawashi here?!
--That's the only thing it can mean!
Dammit! That bastard!
--You still haven't dismantled it?!
--I'm working on it!
Less than ten minutes!
--It's impossible to alter its course now!
--Stay calm. First, we evacuate.
We gotta alert everyone in the neighborhood!
There's no telling what kind
of damage it'll cause! Let's go!
--Is our house going to blow up?
--Let's just hope that's all that happens!
--What do we do about Granny?!
--Carry her out, of course!
--What?!
--Mom! Your bankbook!
Natsuki! Hurry! Natsuki!
--Sakuma, any logs of him inside the admin building?!
--I'm on it!
You're still not giving up?
He said we can't change its course!
Riichi, you said the Arawashi
uses GPS for guidance, right?!
Y-Yeah.
If we can send their atomic clocks fake
correction data like he did yesterday...!
Found 'em! His footprints are clear as day!
--Yeah, that'd cause a positioning error!
--That could change its course a little...!
But there's no guarantee it'll work,
so you should evacuate!
Kenji...
Hurry! All of you, too! Hurry!
We haven't lost yet!
Let's see, how does this work...
Oh, here we go!
Wh-Why?
The password was changed!
He's interfering!
Y-You can't be serious...
Pull yourself together! We're with you!
Only you can solve this!
We're counting on you!
Right!
You can do it!
Yes!
It's open!
So fast...!
--He shut you out!
--Damn! I'll solve it again!
Kazuma!
I lowered his defense to zero!
Demolish him!
Go on!
Master!
Two minutes!
It opened!
Not again!
H-He's doing it in his head...?
One minute left!
Stay out of his way!
Yes, please!
It's a hot spring!
A hot spring!
It made a hot spring!
A miraculous comeback victory!
They're going to the national tournament!
After fifteen grueling innings, the
warriors of Ueda High have prevailed!
But their exhaustion has left them!
They're absolutely overjoyed!
P Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday to you! P
P Happy birthday, dear Granny!
Happy birthday to you! P
Happy birthday, Granny!
Natsuki!
Here, Ryohei. Don't cry.
--It moved! Gross!
--She's saying, "Thank you."
Dad!
You did great.
I saw Wabisuke on the news.
He came forward with the truth.
However, the professor only
developed the Love Machine.
The Department of Defense was
responsible for releasing it into OZ.
Luckily, there are no reports of
death as a result of this incident,
but it goes without saying that the
military bears a heavy responsibility
to the people around the world
who were affected by its experiment.
Oh, and tell Kenji not to come back for a while.
He says you don't need to go back.
Yes, I do!
You two should get married!
No, you need to date first!
What do you say?!
Say you like her and I'll kill you!
--You don't like Natsuki?
--I'll kill you if you don't like her!
--L-l like her a lot!
--You little...!
That makes me happy. Thank you.
Kiss her! Kiss! Kiss!
--S-Stop! Don't make me arrest you!
--Shut up!
I have a nosebleed...!
What a wimp!
Just over that hill lies our summer
All the things that don't change,
all the beautiful things... it's all there
The sunflowers chase after the sun
And we gaze at each other so intently
that we can't even hear the wind
Heart atop heart, filling with drops of light
h' we hold our hands tightly
enough a small miracle will be born
I want you to believe
I can see the future each time
the blue sky is reflected in your eyes
Since the times long ago when
Zero fighter planes flew through the sky,
we were surely destined to meet here
Let's travel along the
thousands of memories of love
I will protect you forever
Our history begins
Oh, wherever fate ends up taking us
I'll never forget that white promise
that was pictured in the clouds
Heart atop heart, we'll dream of the summer
h' we hold our hands tightly enough
a small miracle will be born
Our miracle will be born
A midsummer miracle...
Mother of Summer
We are together...

"All right!"
"King Kazma, King of the Wimps!!"
"You betrayed us, Kazma!"
"More problems with Arawashi!?"

"King Kazma! Beat that monster!!"
"I'll play-"
"To Natsuki-- Please use my account."
"I'm giving my account to you, Natsuki."
"Please protect our family."
