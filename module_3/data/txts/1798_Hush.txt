Go around.
Prick.
Zakes?
Oh. hello. sleeping beauty.
- Are we there yet?
- Nearly.
- Are you hungry?
- God. I'm starving.
- Are there any biscuits left?
- I saved you the last Boaster.
You know how moany you get
if you don't get food.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Oh. my camera battery's dead.
When we get to the services.
Can I use your phone to take photos?
Yeah. sure. but why do they make you
take photos of the posters you put up?
They say it's for the clients.
No. it's because they think
you're a lazy slacker. more like.
Oh. bollocks. Memory's full.
I'll have to delete some.
- They're of our holiday.
- Egypt. Land of a thousand arguments.
Look at that.
- What is it? I can't see it properly.
- A photo of the stars.
Remember that night on the beach?
The one with the brilliant sky?
Why did you just call me a slacker?
It was a joke. Jesus.
- I loved that night.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Oh. you don't remember it. do you?
- Yes. I do.
The stars. Lovely.
Oh. my God. You don't remember.
It's just sky. Beth.
You've seen one star.
You've seen them all.
- Shall I just delete these pictures?
- No.
No. don't be silly.
Come on.
It's not that big a deal. is it?
<i>Hi.</i> It's Sarah.
<i>I can't get to the phone right now,
so leave a message.</i>
Hi. it's me.
Look. I don't think I'll be able
to make the party tonight.
I still haven't told Zakes
about what I did with Leo.
I've tried. but every time
I'm gonna say something. I ju...
Oh. God. I feel shit. Sarah.
I don't know why I did it.
Listen. when you get this.
Can you give me a call?
Bye.
Oh.
Can I use your phone for the photos?
Cheers.
Have you got some petrol money?
No. thanks.
Hello?
Hello?
How many more do we have to do?
- One.
You know. that twat Leo
just called your phone and hung up.
- Leo?
- Yeah. Leo.
It is his sister's birthday.
Probably calling to see if we're going.
He's a sniffer waiting for his chance.
What a cock.
- Zakes?
- What is he. about 40?
People who wear their mobiles
on their belts like that
- are either dads or pricks.
- He's not that bad.
I'm doing this job because it lets me...
Finish your book.
Yeah. I know. I know.
You don't think I can be a writer.
Do you?
I don't know.
I've never read anything you've finished.
Well. I'm not really feeling my writing
at the minute.
Don't you think you should put an effort in.
Even if you're not really feeling it?
Is this about my writing or us?
Do you really not remember the sky.
Zakes?
Oh. for fuck's sake.
- Why are you still going on about that?
- Because it upset me.
- Like you're not bothered about us.
- Do you know what?
I am not doing this.
Do you realize it's a year
since you said we'd move in together.
And you haven't even
mentioned it since.
Where's the flask?
Help!
Jesus.
Jesus.
Beth?
Beth. Beth. Beth. wake up!
I think I just saw a woman
naked in the back of that truck.
A naked fucking woman locked up.
Caged in the back of that truck.
- What the fuck?
- What are you on about. Zakes?
That truck overtook us.
He pulled up there in front of us.
The shutter came up
and there was a woman stood there
with no clothes on. naked.
And she was screaming.
Jesus Christ.
Oh. my God.
Shit.
Right. Well. what are we gonna do?
Zakes?
Yeah. your phone. Give me your phone.
Hello? Yeah. police.
Yeah. I don't know. but I think I've just
seen something really weird on the motorway.
The M1.
Well. it was a woman.
She was tied up naked
in the back of a white truck.
Yeah. my name's Zakes. Zakes Abbot.
The plates.
Just hang on a sec.
The fucking plates have shit
all over them. Fuck.
No. No. I can't see the plates. no.
Okay. thanks. Bye.
What did they say?
They said they're gonna get someone
on to it.
But I really think they need the plates.
Shit.
Maybe we should go and get them.
- What? Are you mad?
- Zakes. we have to do something.
- Jesus fucking Christ. Zakes.
- All right.
Okay. you want me to do something.
All right.
Zakes!
Oh. shit.
I can't see anything.
For fuck's sake.
Yeah. all right. all right.
- You were meant to get the plates.
- Couldn't get that shit off.
- What were you doing?
- Took a picture of inside the truck.
- Look.
- I can't see anything.
Oh. shit.
- Oh. shit.
- What are we gonna do now?
Right. I'm gonna overtake him.
See if you can see his front plates.
Yeah?
I can't.
- I can't see them.
- Oh. shit.
I can't see anything.
Hello? Police.
Just called a minute ago
about a truck on the M1.
I saw a woman caged in the back.
Yeah. a woman. It was a white truck.
No. I couldn't see his plates.
- What junction?
- It was Junction 30. just past Workshop.
We think Junction 30.
Just past Workshop. heading north.
Yeah.
- Okay. Thank you. Thanks. Bye.
- Well?
Something about cameras.
Said they'll sort it.
- How?
- I don't know.
- By stopping every truck on the M1?
- I don't know.
They said we shouldn't get involved.
- What are you doing?
- Look.
Either way.
It isn't our problem any more.
Oh. it isn't our problem?
No! What can we do?
I'm not sure if I saw anything anyway.
- It was all so quick.
- Jesus.
Fuck.
Zakes.
Zakes. Police.
- Zakes.
- I see it.
Pull up behind him. flash him
and tell him about the truck.
Zakes. Zakes. flash him.
- What are you doing?
- This.
- This garage. our last stop.
- You're kidding.
- We miss it. we have to go round.
- You're stopping the car
- to put posters in a toilet!
- This is my job. Beth.
Look. I've called the police.
Jesus. I even got out of the car.
To help
or because you were pissed off with me?
Yeah. sure. You do things.
But your priorities. they're all fucked up!
- Jesus!
- This isn't even about the truck.
This is about me and what a fuck
up you think I am. All right.
I'll finish me book
as soon as we get home.
I'll wrack me brains to remember the sky.
Can move in together this evening.
In fact. right fucking now.
Is that all good with you?
Why have you come tonight.
To have a fucking go at me?
To try and do something
with our relationship!
Oh. like I never do anything.
Not things that mean you have
to go out of your way!
<i>- That poor woman!
- I go out of my way for you.</i>
What? When?
Oh. yeah. you saved me a shitty biscuit!
Oh. I can't do this on my own any more!
When are you gonna fucking grow up?
I'm gonna get a coffee.
Beth. I need your phone
to take photos of the posters.
I've deleted the sky.
So now you can fill my phone with pictures
of toilets as much as you want. okay?
Fuck.
Let's <i>go...</i>
Hey.
What's this. you wanker?
Fucking dickhead!
- Can I nip in?
- It's out of order.
I just wanna put these up.
Are there any posters
in the disabled toilet?
Okay.
Oh. Jesus Christ.
Hurry up.
Next.
Next.
That's 1.10. please.
- Yeah. thanks.
- Thank you.
Beth. look at this.
- I need to tell you something.
- No. hang on a minute.
<i>This is the photo that I took of the
inside of the back of that truck.</i>
Now. give me your hand.
Just hold it still.
Look at that.
Yeah?
Well. it's proof.
It's a hand.
Someone was in the back of that truck.
- What. proof?
- Yeah.
What good is that now. Zakes?
That truck is miles away.
Zakes.
You know. sitting here right now.
I've realized that the...
The only thing that is holding us together
is the time we've spent together.
Because we're not working.
I know that I'm partly responsible
for that and I'm sorry. but...
Well. who you are right now...
it isn't good enough for me. Zakes.
I'm sorry.
Gonna make my own way
back to Manchester.
- Don't be stupid. I can take you back.
- I don't want you to. okay?
I really... I don't want that.
Beth.
Beth. ju...
I'll be waiting in the car!
<i>Hi, Sarah. Listen, it's me.</i>
<i>I know tonight's your party and all,
but, look, I need your help.</i>
<i>I've broken up with Zakes.</i>
<i>Can you come pick me up?
I'm at Stanhope Services on the M1.</i>
I don't have my phone on me.
But maybe I'll try you later.
Let's see what the sniffer's got to say.
Hello?
Hello?
Whoa.
What...?
When you've finished. get in here.
Go round the back.
<i>Oh. God.</i>
Beth.
Oh. I'm sorry. Sorry.
Sorry. I didn't...
Beth?
Beth?
Beth. are you in here?
Look. I'm sorry. okay?
Beth.
- Beth.
- Ah!
- Sorry.
Ls everything okay in here?
- What's going on here?
- What you doing?
Nothing. I was looking for my girlfriend.
Might look like something else. but...
He was spying on me!
- No.
- You pervert.
- No. I thought you were...
I'm looking for my girlfriend.
I thought she might be in here.
- Yeah. yeah. I get it.
- What?
Get back from the game all tanked up?
- Your mates put you up to it. Very funny.
- Oh. no. no. You think I'm...
I'm a poster guy. right?
I put posters up. like this one.
I put the one of the car up outside.
- Look. here.
- Ronnie. watch out!
Get off!
- Don't move! I said don't move!
- For fuck's sake. I'm not. Jesus.
Ronnie. are you okay?
- You've got it wrong.
- Yeah. I'll get rid of him.
I'm looking for my... Ah!
- I'm looking for my girlfriend.
- Outside. son.
Jesus Christ!
Fuck! Just take it easy!
Don't have to pull that hard!
Fucking hell!
Fucking hell.
All right. just take it easy.
- Yeah. yeah. I've heard you.
- Jesus Christ.
Jesus.
What's your problem?
I was looking for my girlfriend.
You should be helping me.
Prick.
<i>Oh. God. no.</i>
Shit.
What the fuck?
Mate. mate. stop! Stop the car!
Sorry. love. I've got to take your car.
Woman driver smacks
into another car. right?
The driver gets out and it's a dwarf.
So he says to the woman.
"I'm not happy."
So she says.
"Which fucking one are you then?"
Oh. fair enough.
Well. I'm off.
- What are you doing?
- He was telling the truth.
He's the poster guy.
He wasn't with the football guys.
See this?
This is a key to the big poster frames.
And look.
He was with a woman.
So what?
He said he couldn't find his girlfriend.
That she had disappeared.
That's why he was in the toilet.
He was looking for her.
Listen. mate.
I've seen this a hundred times before.
Couples on long drives.
They fight. they argue.
I bet you any money.
She's waiting at home for him right now.
But what if she's not?
What. you gonna look through
all the tapes?
That'll take you all night.
Then that's how long it's going to take.
Why? Who cares? it's not our problem.
Our job is to protect this place.
That's it.
What?
I'm off home.
See you tomorrow.
Got you.
Oh. no.
No. come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Oh. no. don't do this to me.
Please.
Where are you?
Okay. now. where are you?
I thought you was going home.
Yeah. so did I.
But I couldn't have you being the hero
all on your own.
- Find anything yet?
- Yes and no.
Look.
There she is at the car.
Then she goes inside. has a coffee.
The poster guy comes. She leaves.
<i>Then. look. look. look. See?</i>
She made a phone call.
But then she just disappears.
- Let's try Zone B.
- <i>I'll</i> do it.
What's the time code?
Time code 00:17:04.
No. I can't see her.
It doesn't make no sense.
She came down the corridor.
And there's nowhere else for her to go.
Man. look.
You tapped in the wrong time code.
- Man.
- Come on. man.
Zero. zero. one. seven. zero. four.
She goes through the emergency doors
with someone.
Why doesn't the alarm go off?
Argh!
Yeah. it's me.
We have a problem.
That girl we took.
Boyfriend's made trouble.
Yeah. I think he may be following you.
Got you. you bastard.
Where is he?
Oh. no.
Oh. shit.
<i>I repeat, Ford Granada,

- All right. take it easy.
- Just calm down.
- No. I am calm.

My girlfriend's... Jesus!
Give me your hand.
- What are you doing? Ah!
- Got anything on you? Carrying anything?

Anything you say may be used
in evidence against you.
Do you understand?
All right. listen to me.

Look. I'm telling you the truth.
Oh. I remember... Yeah. yeah. yeah.
Earlier I called 999.
Yeah. about the same truck.
About an hour ago.
I saw a woman tied up in the back
and I think the same truck
took my girlfriend.
Look. please. he's parked in here.
All I need you to do is just go out
and have a look.
That's all.
Fucking hell.
I'm not going anywhere.
Please. just look for a truck
with a broken taillight.
<i>Golf Alpha three-nine,

Right. listen. You've got to help me.
Was my girlfriend in there?
She's blond. Her name's Beth.

in that truck like that?
She's got blond hair.
- Right. I've got to follow it.
- What?
I've got to.
My girlfriend's in the back of that truck!
- Shouldn't we call the police?
- Yeah. yeah. you call them.
Haven't you called them yet?
- No. I can't.
They think I killed someone.
There's no signal.
Oh. fuck it.
How did you get out?
I saw that the back was open
and I just ran.
Would've tried getting others out.
- But here were locks on the cages.
- Is Beth all right? My girlfriend Beth?
I think so.
Oh. no. Shit.
Which way?
What's that?
- What?
I think I saw some lights up there.
No. please!
Leo. listen to me.
Please. don't hang up.
The battery's going
and Beth's gone missing.
No. no. she's been taken
by someone in a white truck.
So I need you to call the police and...
Hello?
Hello?
No signal.
Come on.

I saw a house further back.
It had lights on.
The truck? Your girlfriend?
We've got no phone.
We're almost out of petrol.
I say we go back to that house.
See if they've got a car we can use.
Or a phone.
And then you can call the police.
