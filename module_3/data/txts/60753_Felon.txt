Okay, let's get you
some bananas.
You haven't even touched
your cereal yet.
I thought you were hungry.
Good.
So, what's up for today?
Uh, well, today, we gotta give
the caterer the last check.
Go over the decorations
at the church.
And I have to find out why
my dress is gonna cost more.
You know, I told them
I didn't want lace on the bust,
instead they doubled it.
How much more?
Six-fifty.
Whoa. Six-fifty.
That's a lot of money.
Mikey... come here.
Six-fifty. What do
you think of that, huh? You sure?
Yeah.
Man says go for it.
Really?
It's your wedding dress, baby.
Mikey wants Mom to look hot.
So do I.
Major brownie points.
Hey. Hand me
that... Manny.
Thanks.
What time
we got, 4:30?
On the dot, Wade.
Checks, boys.
I'm down with that, man.
Time to get paid.
Baby.
Mm?
We got the business loan.
Oh, shut up.
Are you kidding?
Oh, baby, that's so great.
I can hire four
or five more guys.
I get Joe to run a second crew.
Do another 30 grand this year.
I'm so proud of you, baby.
You built up this entire
business all on your own.
No. We did.
Somebody's in the house.
Shh.
We gotta get Mikey. Quiet.
Stay with me.
Okay.
Okay. Hey.
What's wrong?
Shh. Everything's okay.
Everything's okay.
What's happening?
Shh. Everything's okay.
Just go back to sleep.
Stay in this room.
Wade!
Stop! What are you
doing?
Back off!
I said stop!
Damn it.
Oh, God.
Wade, what's happening?
Stay in the house!
Stay in the house!
Stay alive, please.
Please don't...
Heh. Jesus Christ.
Motherfucker, I did that.
Wade, I'm calling 911!
Can she at least
put him to bed, please?
We didn't find
a weapon anywhere.
He did have your wallet
in his hand.
Maybe you thought
that, uh... if you...
No. What I saw was,
he was reaching for something.
I thought it was
a gun or weapon.
I told him to stop.
He kept turning around, okay?
So I aimed the bat
at his shoulder,
then he started to duck.
Look, if he was still
in the house when it happened,
or if he was at least armed,
we could make a case
for self-defense.
But the problem is...
he was no longer a threat
when he left the house.
Yet you proceeded to chase him
outside with a bat.
Killed him with one swing.
Wait a second, please.
I didn't... It was an accident.
I'm sorry.
We're gonna have to place you
under arrest for murder.
Murder?
Are you out of your minds?
The guy was robbing us.
He was in my child's room!
Ma'am, I understand...
No, what was Wade
supposed to do?
Wait for the guy
to shoot him first?
No. What he should have done
is stay inside and dial 911.
Face the wall.
Hands over your head.
Hands up on the wall.
<i>Are you HIV positive?</i>
No.
Don't touch this button
unless it's an emergency.
Come back up in here.
You know what I'm saying?
Don't come back up in here.
You eyeball me, motherfucker,
huh? You eyeballing me?
You motherfucker.
Oh, I see.
You're a bitch, huh?
I'm gonna clean your mouth out.
You suck my dick, motherfucker.
Fuck you.
Fight in 33! Fight in 33!
All of you get
against the wall!
Crew resistance.
Crew resistance.
I'll fucking kill you.
Against the
wall, everybody.
Get up against the wall!
I'll kill you, boy.
All this started
from you looking, man.
You're dead, motherfucker!
You're so dead.
Keep your
hands on your heads.
You down for yours, homes?
We gonna have a wreck in here?
No.
Good.
You just clean up the pad
on Wednesdays and Saturdays.
And keep all your shit
on your bunk.
Hey.
Hey.
Baby, wh...? What happened
to your face?
I got jumped.
Well, we gotta tell somebody.
It won't help, Laura.
Are you okay?
How's Mikey?
He's scared.
He just keeps asking
for you, Wade.
I-I... I didn't know
what to tell him.
So I-I told him that
you went on a trip.
And it doesn't help that
we're staying with my mother.
Great.
Wade, I didn't feel safe
at the house by myself.
Everything's gonna be okay.
I promise you.
We have to get you out of here.
They're gonna give me
a public defender.
Let me see what they say.
We'll go from there.
I'm Mara Reid.
I'll be representing you.
Hi. Nice to
meet you.
This part's more of a formality.
Judge will arraign you.
Set bail at a million, which is
mandatory for a murder charge.
Do you have a million dollars
in collateral to make bail?
No. Not even close.
Anybody willing to help out
and cosign? Maybe your parents?
My parents died nine years ago.
I'll do what I can
to move things along.
Yeah!
State of revolution!
Revolution!
Come on in. Come
on, motherfucker.
Get in.
What are we gonna be?
We'll see.
We'll see.
Did Smith say why
they were rioting?
No. It's like he got
everyone riled up
just for the hell of it.
Now, with John,
there's always a reason.
Come and destroy me.
Break the illusion to pieces.
Sure know how to stir up
a pile of shit, don't you, boy?
Well, you know me, Gordon.
Always one
for live entertainment.
They mean business
this time, John.
They wanna stick you
in the hole forever.
Now, you and I both know
you don't want that.
My Maria would have
been 27 yesterday.
Is that what this is all about?
You gotta stop living
in the past, John.
Hey, I am the past.
Now, I should've been
a dead man walking.
Instead, they turned me
into the walking fucking dead.
All right, look.
I'm gonna get 'em
to transfer you.
Give you a fresh start.
But after that,
I am all out of favors,
you understand me?
Well, I guess it's, uh...
on to the next chapter,
huh, Gordon?
Then again, maybe not.
Just behave yourself,
would you?
Come on.
What the hell's going on?
My preliminary hearing
was supposed to be weeks ago.
I asked for more time
to build your case.
But I got some good news.
The DA's sympathetic
to your situation. He is.
He's agreed to reduce
to an invol,
if you plead no contest
forthwith commitment...
Hold on. What does that mean?
If you plead no contest,
he'll reduce the charge
to involuntary manslaughter.
It means you get no more
than three years,
and you start serving it
immediately.
You stay out of trouble,
you only do half.
Hell, you've already got
95 days time served.
You'd be out
in less than 15 months.
And what other options
do I have?
We go to a jury trial...
which will take a year
to get to anyway,
and they try you
for second-degree murder.
It carries a mandatory sentence
of 15 years to life.
Look, take the deal.
We won't do better.
Your Honor, the defendant
is willing to plead guilty
to an amended count
of involuntary manslaughter.
We've agreed to a three-year
sentence in state prison
with a forthwith commitment.
The 97 days Mr. Porter
has served in county jail
would be credited
to his overall sentence.
Mr. Porter...
do you understand
<i>that this conviction</i>
can be used against you
in any future violations
<i>or convictions,</i>
resulting in additional time
<i>added to your sentence?</i>
<i>Yes, Your Honor.</i>
And, Mr. Porter,
<i>do you understand</i>
that you'll be banned from
buying or possessing
<i>any firearms,</i>
that until your sentence
<i>and parole term</i>
of three years is served,
you cannot vote <i>in any election</i>
or leave the county
<i>without authorization.</i>
Do you understand <i>these terms?</i>
<i>Yes, Your Honor.</i>
Now, therefore, Mr. Porter,
for your conviction
in count one,
this court sentences you
to three years in state prison,
with a credit of 97 days
already served.
Good luck to you, sir.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Yo, man.
We caught the chain
to the motherfucking
madhouse, homey.
It's like this place
is always cracking off.
Yo, my name is Jake.
They call me Snowman.
What's yours?
Wade.
Wade.
Yo, man... know who
that fucker is, Wade?
White dude with the mustache?
That's Danny Samson.
Dude's in the Brand.
He should be locked up
at the SHU at the Bay right now,
but, like... the mad dog's
genius, you know?
He flies under the radar.
He's like a sleeper.
No letters,
no AB tats, nothing.
Cops can't fucking
validate him.
What's the Brand?
It's the Aryan
Brotherhood, man.
Yo, you better figure
your shit out fast, homey.
All right, so, what time's
the game tonight?
Five.
What are you doing?
Hiding from Jill Sanders.
She wants to fight me,
but... she's a girl.
Uh, which one?
The one in the white?
Well, she is big.
Yeah, she's huge.
Well, you tell her...
you're not gonna fight, period.
So she might as well
just let it go.
And if that doesn't work,
then, you know...
just kick her in the nuts.
Pow!
Give me a hug.
Get out of here, man.
Come on.
Rrr!
I'll see you later.
Hey, Todd. You know
I was kidding, right?
The weak are the ones
who can't avoid trouble.
I know, Dad.
All right.
See you later.
Oh, man.
Yo, that fucking toad's
eyeballing you, homey.
Got into a fight with him
at county.
Didn't think it was
that big a deal.
Shit, man. Everything in here
is a big fucking deal.
You look at someone
the wrong way, it's on.
You fucking don't
look at them, it's on.
Do yourself a favor.
When we get down to the yard,
get down for
your fucking race, wood.
Sling it with the first fucking
monkey who opens his mouth.
I'll back you up. Don't you
fucking worry about it.
It's jumping off.
What?
Hey, don't...
We have a major 415
in the back of the bus.
Multiple inmates involved.
Have an ERT unit
dispatched and ready.
Oh, fuck.
They got the
motherfucking goon squad.
Say you found it under your seat
and don't say shit.
Rats get whacked.
What are you doing, man?
Sit down and shut up. Now!
Head down! Now!
And stay down... stay quiet,
or I'll CN gas
the whole fucking bus.
Let you choke on it.
Send him to the infirmary.
Throw the rest of them
in the hole
till we figure this shit out.
Team, get 'em off the bus!
Get your asses up.
Let's go off the bus. Let's go.
Let's go. Hurry up.
It wasn't my weapon, I swear.
Save that shit.
It was under my seat.
Heh. Jesus Christ.
What am I gonna do?
Oh, man.
Hey!
Hey, guard!
Shut the fuck up, bitch!
Guard, please!
Hello?
What am I gonna do?
One fucking phone call!
Damn it, this is fucking crazy.
This motherfucker. Come on!
Please, God. Please.
I shouldn't even
fucking be in here!
Get your head off
the ground, fish.
You look at me in my eyes
when I talk to you.
We know you didn't stick
that inmate on the bus.
Just tell us who did it,
and you're out of it.
I don't know.
I found the weapon
under my seat.
Somebody must have
slid it on the floor.
Bullshit.
We know it was Danny Samson.
Just admit it.
If you already know,
why do you need me?
Son of a bitch.
I will put you in the hole...
Come on.
till you're fucking an old man.
You hear me?
Wait, wait, wait.
Let me tell you about that piece
of shit you're covering for.
You think he'll give
you love for this,
get yourself
some protection, right?
Samson's a stone-cold killer
who could give a fuck about you.
Look what he did
to one of his own race.
You don't mean shit to him.
Look at me, boy.
When the time comes,
he will whack you.
Protect his own ass.
Is that who you
looking to back?
That inmate on the bus
that got stuck in the neck?
He's in critical condition.
If he dies, you're going down
for accessory to murder.
I don't know, guys.
I don't know. I'm sorry.
Fuck it.
He wants to soldier up
with his new homeys.
Let him.
Congratulations, Porter.
You're on your way to the SHU.
That's my motherfucking house.
Let's go.
Come on. Come on, bitch!
Come get some!
Open A Section.
Step inside.
One, two, three...
Welcome home.
One, two, three.
Again. One, two...
Look how lucky you are.
Against the wall.
What's up?
Crack 13.
Do not move.
There's a fucking gun
trained on your head.
Move to the right.
Step inside.
Close 13.
Get something straight.
We're hands-on in here.
You'll receive
no warning shots.
I'll uncuff your first hand.
Grip the food port. Understand?
Yes.
Grab the food port.
I'll gonna uncuff
your second hand.
You're gonna step away
from the door. You understand?
Do you understand me?
Yes.
Step inside.
You're in here 23/7.
Get an hour yard time a day.
Three showers a week.
That's it.
Welcome to the SHU.
Sixteen.
Seventeen, 18...
19.
Warden Reed at Salinas
speaks highly of you.
Adapted well, led by example.
The Army taught me a lot, sir.
Rangers, huh?
Shock and Awe, Iraqi Freedom?
No, sir. I just missed it.
Did most of my tour
in Korea in the DMZ.
Any action?
It was like watching paint dry.
NK'd look at us.
We'd look at them.
Maybe one of us would give
the other the finger.
That's about it.
Ha.
You'll see more than that
working in the SHU.
That'd suit me just fine, sir.
Good. Give me a minute
with the warden.
I'll introduce you around.
Sure.
Thank you, sir.
Collins.
So, what's on your mind, Bill?
Hear they're transferring
John Smith here.
Day after tomorrow.
So we're putting him in
Protective Custody with Manson?
No, we'll put him
in here in the SHU.
Seriously, come on.
He's caused a wreck
in every house he's been in.
We're better off isolating him.
I'm not adding to that
son of a bitch's celebrity.
We'll put him in there
with the other hard cases.
That's what the SHU's for.
Yes, sir.
Porter, yard time!
Let's go, strip down.
Pass your clothes and shoes
through the food port.
Anything sharp in there?
Nope.
If I get cut, I'm
gonna fucking hurt you.
Run your fingers
through your hair.
Open your mouth.
Lift up your tongue,
roll it side to side.
Run your finger
along your gum line.
Show me behind your left ear.
Behind your right.
Show me your pits.
Arms up.
Lift your nut sack.
Lift your dick.
Turn around.
Lift your right foot.
Wiggle your toes.
Lift your left foot.
Wiggle your toes.
Listen carefully,
I want you to squat three times.
On the third squat...
Stop, stop, stop.
I want you to
squat three times.
Listen to my voice.
On the third squat,
I want you to spread
your cheeks, cough.
Go.
Okay.
You're good. Get dressed.
Let's go.
Fucking fish. Jesus.
Come on.
Face the wall.
Okay. I'm just buttoning it.
Step away.
Crack 13.
Back up.
Close 13.
Stop right there.
Close side port.
Put your hands
through the port.
I release this first cuff,
grab the top of the port.
I'll release the second cuff,
step away from the door.
Get in the yard.
Hit him. Hit him.
Fucking told you, man.
Gladiator school's on.
I got 10 on Gonzales.
Shit, I got that action.
Williams gonna fuck him up.
Come on. Come on.
Oh, no. Get up, get up, man.
Get up.
Little something we do
to keep it interesting.
Assholes will fight anyway.
Who you got?
I'm with you,
lieutenant. Gonzales.
Attaboy. Sergeant?
I got Williams.
'Course you do.
Shit.
I'm <i>el fuego.</i>
Fucking Gonzales.
Pepper that asshole.
Fuck!
The whole fight was over!
Beat your ass,
Uncle Tom house nigger!
Yeah, you, Jackson!
You ain't shit without that gat.
You know it.
Pull Williams
out first. Alone.
Think I'm scared
of some hole time, nigga?
Fuck you and the hole.
Who said you was going
in the hole?
Put him in the review room.
Uncuff him.
Lieutenant.
Yup.
I believe I'm done now.
What the fuck is up now? What?
You said, nigger, right?
That's all you came with?!
Who the nigger now?
Put him in the hole, LT?
Throw him in his cell.
Let everybody see it.
Still the reigning champ.
Yeah.
Everybody see this?
SHU inmates can't have packages
until next quarter.
I'm wearing an underwire bra.
We're gonna have to
strip-search you.
Please take off your shirt.
Need you to take off
your bra too.
Raise your arms.
Thank you.
Hey, baby.
What's wrong?
It, uh... It's nothing,
baby. I'm... I'm fine.
Jesus Christ, Wade,
they wouldn't let me see you
or talk to you
for three months.
Then I get this phone call
saying that you're in a...
A security housing unit.
What's going on?
Um...
Just got caught up in something.
Something?
That's it? That's
all you're gonna say?
Yeah, well... they took away
90 days of my good time.
Why? Wade, what did
you do?
I didn't do anything. I swear.
You must have done something.
Why would they be punishing you?
Things just aren't
that simple in here, Laura.
I can't explain it to you.
You just have to trust me.
Please.
How's Mikey?
He's fine.
Will you bring him next time?
I gotta see him.
I will. He misses you.
Wade, we're out of money.
Mortgage is due, and I've
been trying to find a job.
But I can't find one
that will pay it...
A job? What about Mikey?
My mom's gonna watch him
during the day.
I thought we were
nine months ahead.
Yeah, we were, and then
the wedding, remember?
I didn't get all
our deposits back.
All right.
Just use the new checks
from the SBA loan.
That'll get you by until
I figure something else out.
No, babe, that's your business.
I don't wanna...
The hell with my business.
I can't think
about that right now.
Just use the checks.
Open A Section.
Good to see you, wood.
Anything you need,
you let me know.
I got you, Smith.
That's right, wood.
I know who you are, homey.
Porter. Get your fish ass
on the floor facing the wall.
On your knees.
Hands behind your head.
You hear me fucking
talking to you, Porter?
Crack 13!
Letters from John Henry Smith.
Posted right there
on the Internet
for everyone to see.
"As any student of philosophy
will tell you
"the truth about
the human condition today
"lies in our ability
"to face those things which
we loathe most about ourselves.
To comprehend human altruism
and common decency."
Blah, blah, blah.
Does anybody buy this shit?
Now, I remember when
I first heard about you.
You took out, what,
16, 17 people, right?
Personally...
I think you're
a fucking hypocrite,
writing this shit.
Expecting people to, what,
get something out of it?
Fucking asshole lifers.
Find religion and wanna
change the world.
Tookie and his fucking
kids' books. And now you.
Found this in your property.
Family is everything, isn't it?
I'm gonna hang
onto this for you.
Keep it safe.
You pull any shit in my house...
and I will show you what
true fucking vengeance is.
We clear?
Close 13.
Turn around.
I'll release this cuff,
grip the food port.
Step away.
Porter, you can get up.
Smith, you got some fresh meat.
You wanna fuck or fight?
Neither.
Keep it that way.
I like this bunk.
Okay.
Here you go.
You jerk off, face the wall.
You break wind...
put your ass to the door.
If you shit and piss,
in the can.
Do all that,
we'll get along famously.
Smith! Porter!
Yard time!
Thirty-three. Down.
Thirty-four. Down.
Thirty-five.
Down.
Thirty-six. Down.
Thirty-seven.
Who the fuck is this fool?
No, no, he...
How you doing, Smith?
Anything you need, bro.
This mean the southerners
are backing him?
I heard he's got history with
some of their shot callers.
How you doing?
This is the guy I was telling
you about, man. This is Wade.
Hey.
Bodie.
County skinhead.
Hey. Wade. Santa Clarita.
Fucking welcome
to the jungle, huh?
Fucking SHU's no joke, is it?
Yeah. Thanks.
Yeah, you should
fucking thank me, man.
Samson says you're solid.
Yeah?
So you two are
Aryan Brotherhood then?
No, man. We're the ones
putting the work in though.
Earning our fucking letters.
So why'd that guy
get stabbed on the bus?
That was a drug debt, man.
The fucking needle Nazi owed,
so he got taxed...
Hey! Like he said,
keep handling business
and do as you're told,
and we'll get down for you.
Trust me, you'll need it.
Thanks.
That who you're headed back to?
Yeah.
Supposed to be married
four months ago.
What's your boy's name?
Michael.
Looks like you.
In the eyes and the mouth.
Fortunately, my Maria
took after her mother.
You got a picture of them?
You saw them take
the last one I had.
Sorry.
What for?
I remember it all like
it was this morning.
Everything.
The smell of Anne's perfume
when I'd come through the door.
That look she'd give me
like I was the only man
that mattered.
My Maria and... her little smile
when she... laid on my chest.
She liked to listen
to me breathing.
They can't take that away.
Feel like I really
let 'em down.
You will... if you don't
make it out of here.
But you're in the car, right?
In the car?
Means you're cliqued up
with somebody.
A gang.
Just hope...
you don't think
all they want you to do
is run out in the schoolyard
and yell "nigger."
How do you make it on your own?
Perception is reality.
I...chose to
create mine.
Others chose to accept it.
Who was that guy you were
talking to out at the yard?
What is this,
20 fucking Questions?
His name's Oso.
He's a southern shot caller.
It means he's got
the keys to the house.
It means...
none of his soldiers
will make a move
without his say-so.
Well, I... I don't know.
How do you know who's with who?
Okay, fish.
I'll be the good <i>veterano</i>
and teach you prison politics.
But you're gonna do
something for me.
Okay, what?
Stay away from me in the yard.
I understand.
No, you don't.
This is my world
until death do us part.
You're only a tourist.
All right, first lesson
for woods like you and me:
if it ain't white,
it ain't right.
Prison is not
about street gangs.
It's about race.
The Hispanics are cut in half.
<i>You got the northerners
and the southerners.</i>
<i>And trust me, they're
always at war.</i>
<i>With the blacks, you
got a whole mixture</i>
<i>of gangs who pretty
much forget their beefs</i>
<i>and unite with the Asians
and the Pacific Islanders.</i>
<i>Don't bother trying to
figure out who's who.</i>
<i>They all hate you.</i>
<i>Then you got the
skins and the woods.</i>
<i>Nearly all the whites follow
the Aryan Brotherhood,</i>
<i>who run the show.
Gangs underneath them</i>
will try to recruit you,
build up their numbers,
get you to sling their drugs,
<i>stab who they don't like.</i>
<i>You pay attention to
who's calling the shots</i>
<i>with the whites.</i>
<i>Tell you to do something and
you don't handle business,</i>
<i>they'll handle you.</i>
What's up?
How you doing, man?
You see that Predator-looking
motherfucker over there?
Yeah.
Crack it off, homey.
Yo, watch it.
No, no, no, no. Let it go on
for a minute. Come on.
Book his fucking ass.
Get up.
Get up, man.
Yo, fight hard.
Want me to stop it now, lieutenant?
Yeah, yeah.
Shoot Turner in the leg
with the Mini-14.
But, sir, he's losing...
Shoot Turner in the leg
with the Mini-14.
Get his ass! Come on!
Fuck him up. Fuck him up.
He jumped a female officer
on the main line.
Now send him a message.
I'll get him good
with this one, sir.
Don't let him up, Wade.
Stomp that motherfucker.
Get down, homey.
Get down!
Fuck! Ah!
That is the enemy
down there, officer.
You show these assholes
any weakness,
and they will send <i>you</i>
a message.
Blow holes in you with a piece
of iron and gut you like a fish.
Is that what you want?
No, sir...
No, sir. That's right,
that's not what you want.
It's real simple, Collins.
You are either
in the car with us,
or you are not.
Which one is it?
'Cause I can transfer you...
I'm in the car, sir.
Good, goddamn it. Now you learn
from your experiences then.
Now clear the yard.
Call in the medical staff.
I'll do the report.
You're making bones, wood.
Time to get that shit clean.
Why did they shoot
that guy with a rifle?
Better question is,
why didn't they shoot you?
You were kicking his ass.
Yeah, can't somebody
say something?
Get something very clear
in your head.
Once you leave that courtroom,
society's rules
no longer apply.
We play by the cops' rules.
Play by the gangs' rules.
However they want it.
This fucking place
is so twisted.
Prison desensitizes you.
First time you see a guy's face
cut up, you puke.
Second time, you're concerned.
After a while,
you step right over
and could give a shit.
It's no different for them
pulling the trigger.
Make no mistake...
we're all in prison.
Man. There's still
a lot of fights going on.
Why Sacramento doesn't learn
how to segregate the yards again
is beyond me.
Warden, how long have
we been working together?
Trust me, sir. I have it
all under control.
I know you do.
All right. Thanks a lot.
Well?
There's Daddy.
Way to be, homey.
You got down.
Hey, guys.
What was that?
You can't survive in here
on your own.
You just can't.
Well, so, what are you,
some Nazi skinhead now?
I don't expect you
to understand.
I don't.
How we making out
with the bills?
Well...
the business loan is gone.
I'm halfway through
the equity line on the house.
And, uh...
well, you know, my temp job
doesn't even begin to
cover our overhead.
Tell you the truth,
I don't know what to do.
All right, screw it.
Sell the house.
Sell my truck.
Sell whatever you can.
Oh, Wade, that's our house.
I know. But you and Michael are
what's important right now.
We'll save up,
we'll get another house.
Laura...
look at me.
Soon as I get out of here,
all of this, it is history,
I swear to you.
So, what, they...?
They protect you?
In exchange for what?
You just let me
worry about that. Okay?
Kick his ass!
Shoot 'em right in the chest.
Get their attention.
Nice shooting, Ranger.
Damn, wood.
That's good.
Yeah. Get up and fight.
Hit 'em.
What's up, man?
Doing all right?
Yeah.
Why don't you get
over there and show 'em
what you're made of, homey.
Why don't you, homey?
What, you... You put
in some work,
and you think you're
calling the shots now?
You think you're Billy Badass?
You better get your
fucking ass over there, boy.
I ain't seen you fight once
since I've been here.
Let's get this motherfucker.
Get down! Fuck him!
Hey!
Boss, they're in the fucking
blind spot.
Hit 'em with the CN gas.
Get down or I'll put you down!
Get down!
You better have eyes in the back
of your fucking head.
Smith, get to the back
of the cell on your knees.
Face the wall.
Hands behind your head.
You move, you will
get shot. Crack 13.
Let's go.
Close 13.
You get up, Smith.
I warned you, fish.
Now you got me
in the hat with you.
You think they'll
let this slide?
They're gonna
green-light us both.
I should kick your
fucking ass myself.
It wouldn't be hard right now.
Thanks, John.
You wanna know how I survive?
You're about to get
a crash course, my friend.
You get everything
out of the house?
Yeah. Yeah, the storage
unit's completely filled.
You sure you're okay
with this mess
just until escrow closes?
As soon as we get the check,
Michael and I will
find another place...
Laura. Of course I'm okay.
You and Michael can stay
as long as you like.
Always. Always snorting.
I'm not kidding.
Pick it?
Lieutenant.
You getting some shopping done?
Yeah. One can eat only
so much pizza and fast food.
Heh. My wife and I
recently divorced.
Oh.
Yeah.
Oh, I'm sorry.
This is my wife, Kelly.
And this is Lieutenant Jackson.
Bill. Call me Bill.
Nice to meet you, Bill.
Ha. Nice to meet you.
Well, congratulations.
You guys know if
it's a boy or a girl?
It's a girl.
Oh, I remember these days.
They go by so fast.
You guys are gonna make
great parents. I can tell.
Yeah. So are you all
settled in from the move?
No, not completely.
We still have to buy a house.
Right.
We need the extra room now.
You know, let me know
if I can help.
And, uh, don't be afraid
to tell people around here
that you are part
of the family.
More than half this town
is employed at the prison.
And, uh, we take care
of our own.
Okay. I'll do that.
Thank you.
See you tomorrow, James.
See you, lieutenant.
He seems like
a really nice guy.
Hm.
Back up.
Turn around.
Two steps back.
Close 13!
Keep your head up
out there today.
What do you care?
Give you something else
to shoot at.
All right. Suit yourself.
It's done, homey.
Regulation time.
There's my bitch, huh?
Fucking lame.
Should have known after all
the shit we did for you.
We?
Shut your hole.
Far as I'm concerned,
you're the fucking lame.
I saw you pass
the shank on the bus.
Fuck!
Weapon went in the toilet,
sergeant. Saw it.
No wood will touch you.
If you wanna ride with us,
come see me.
Otherwise... you're
on your own.
I can't believe Samson's
giving 'em a pass.
Stick Bodie and Rooker
in the hole.
Wait, Bill.
What about Samson?
What about him?
When I get something on him,
it will be something
that'll stick.
Why does he hate that guy
so much?
Samson gassed him on
the main line five years ago.
Hit him square in the face
with fucking piss and shit.
Ended up catching hepatitis A,
which he passed on
to his wife and kid.
We all got
our Danny Samsons in here.
You stay on the job
long enough...
so will you.
What a piece of work's man.
And there is nothing either good
or bad but thinking makes it so.
Human beings are perhaps
never more dangerous
than when they are convinced
beyond a doubt
that they are right.
Patience, penance.
What do these ones represent?
Well, that's my calendar.
Anne's birthday.
That was our first date.
That's our anniversary.
My Maria's birthday.
First day she walked.
And day they were
taken from me.
And that empty box,
what's that one?
This is...
the day we're reunited.
Are you writing your girl?
Yeah. I'm trying.
I'm just running
out of things to say.
Now... you said...
you've been together six years.
How come you haven't
married her before now?
I just... wanted to be
set first.
You know? Just...
wanted to give her some,
uh, stability...
something neither of us had
growing up.
Boy, you sure fucked
that up, didn't you?
Yeah.
Yeah. You could say that.
Hey, John.
You think Samson
will keep his word?
Oh, just don't give him
a reason not to.
You're an island now...
in a sea of sharks.
They all know
you're on your own.
Come on, Mike.
Finish it off good. Let's go.
Come on.
This is the last one, buddy.
Yeah!
Whoo!
Come on.
Oh!
Yeah!
Make 'em practice
hard, coach. Come on.
Todd's amazing.
Come on, Todd. Big T.
You know, I was thinking maybe
we should cool it for a while.
Cool what?
You know...
just stick to CDC policy.
Do it by the books
just for a while.
That bureaucratic bullshit
does not work. You know this.
I know.
Of all people, you should know this.
I know, I'm just... Those
fucking yard cameras, man.
They pick up everything.
All it takes is for
one person to get ahold...
Those cameras are there
for us to police ourselves.
Ain't nobody checking
nothing. Nothing.
Where's this coming from?
Uh...
I just don't want us
to lose everything
we worked so hard for, Bill.
I mean, I'm too close
to my pension,
and I don't wanna lose it
over some punk inmate, fucking...
Wait. Now, stop. How much money
you make in OT last year?
How much money did you make?
I know. Sixty-eight grand.
Yeah, right.
On top of a good salary.
Yes. Yeah.
Well, come on. You know?
There's a reason we're
the highest paid officers
in the state.
Because all they give
a shit about
is that we keep those pieces
of shit out of society.
And there ain't nobody gonna
burst that bubble, baby.
Nobody. Okay?
You just keep doing it.
All right.
Trust me, all right?
All right.
Come on, Todd.
Whoo! Coming around.
Come on, coach.
Make 'em hustle.
<i>Stop!</i>
<i>Wade?</i>
Stay in the house!
I said, stop.
Wade!
Bad dream?
You ever think about
the people that you killed?
No.
Can't get this guy's face
out of my head.
Should have stayed inside,
let him go.
No.
You did what you had to do.
Protect your family.
That's the only thing
that matters.
Can I ask you something?
Why didn't you just kill
the two guys?
Why the others?
Sorry.
No.
You don't have to...
tell me.
Hey, you sleep three feet away
from a guy...
breathing the same air...
you have to know things
about him.
And when your life is...
forever defined
by a single action,
it changes time.
It feels like
a thousand years ago in my body,
but in my mind, it...
<i>feels like it
happened yesterday.</i>
You know that feeling
when you...
come home and see
your wife and kid?
Yeah.
<i>Try to imagine
the unimaginable.</i>
When I came home and...
saw them lying there...
exposed.
<i>Covered in blood.</i>
My little Maria's... broken legs
were spread so far apart...
they dislocated her hips.
<i>She was 7 years old.</i>
I wanted those two... punks
to experience what I did.
I wanted them to know
the unimaginable,
and I gave them that.
I killed every member
of their families.
Their bloodline wiped clean.
I took their madness.
I purified it.
Before I killed them,
they knew that loss.
I wanted the death penalty
but I didn't get it.
I wanted to be with my Anne
and my Maria.
And that doesn't givev
those motherfuckers the right...
to break me.
It does give them the right
to watch me...
rot.
Hey.
What's wrong?
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm just tired.
You sure?
Yeah.
I can't believe it's
been 11 months already.
All I think about is
holding you again.
Was hoping you'd bring Mikey.
Yeah, I... I would have,
but he had some nightmares
after the last visit,
so...
I thought it'd be better
to leave him at home.
Yeah, you're right.
Probably shouldn't see
this place ever again, anyway.
Yep.
So we sold the house.
Okay. The full, uh,
425, right?
No. We, uh...
We closed at 380.
What?
Three-eighty? Shit, Laura.
I mean, with all the equity
gone in the house,
you're gonna barely make
$10,000.
How're you gonna
survive on that?
You don't think I hadn't
thought about that?
If you thought you could have
done better, you should have.
Hey, I'm the one in here
stuck doing time, remember?
Oh, you don't think
I'm not doing it too?
While you're in there
hanging with your homeboys,
I'm dealing with the fucking
mess called our life!
Your tools are gone.
Your truck, gone.
Our house, Wade, is gone!
And meanwhile, I'm working
this piece-of-shit temp job,
I barely see Michael,
and I get to live with my mother
and listen to all
her bullshit all day long
while everyone we know
stares at me in pity.
All right. Calm down,
okay?
I'm sorry. I know
you're dealing with a lot.
But you have no idea
the shit that goes on in here.
What I've had to do
just to survive.
No. Tell me.
'Cause I don't know.
I can't.
Fuck you, Wade!
No.
Don't go, Laura, please.
Please, just sit back down!
Please!
Down!
Three.
Now!
Four.
Now!
Five.
You wanna know the secret
to making it in here?
Routine. Just like
on the outside.
Get up in the morning.
Eat your breakfast.
Do your chores. Exercise.
Go to work.
Everything, you do it down
to the last detail.
This is the only prison.
Still thinking about
your girl? Her visit?
You should have seen
her face, man.
I couldn't do a fucking
thing about it.
I've seen it mess
with a lot of guys.
You leave that visit on
a bad note, it stays that way.
Keep moving.
She's everything to me, man.
If I don't have her
or Michael...
I am so done with this shit.
Come on, motherfuckers!
Here we go. This is
gonna be a brawl.
Can't wait.
Fuck that motherfucker.
I'm not fighting you, man.
Hold that motherfucker. Come on.
Get him. Get... Get that...
What the fuck you doing?
Get him! Yeah, fuck.
Fuck that motherfucker.
Fuck that motherfucker.
You called me up here for this?
Clear the room.
You heard
the lieutenant. Get out.
You wanna fuck with me?
Put him in the infirmary.
If I debrief, I wanna be put
in PC for the rest of my term.
Or I'm fucking dead.
You give me everything.
Everything.
You're in protective
custody at night.
Speak.
And to think...
19 years I've been dealing
with you assholes.
Pushing me.
Testing me.
Hell, I've had
six hits put on me
personally that I know about.
Imagine the stress
of that every day,
wondering if today's
the day they get you.
And people wonder
why prison guards
have an average life expectancy
of only 55 years.
Well, that won't be me.
I don't succumb to pressure.
I inflict it.
Jesus Christ. Please. Please!
Please, I'm begging you.
Fuck! I'm begging you.
Tell me.
Please, lieutenant. I'm sorry.
And if I let this slide,
what's the next asshole
gonna pull?
I guess I gotta put
a little more
fear in you, motherfuckers.
Huh? Up the ante.
I'm so... I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Please. Please, God.
You know what?
Think I got a better way.
You know that inmate that
Samson stuck on the bus?
Yeah.
He died.
Now, I could give a fuck.
But you should.
See, 'cause with the right
paperwork by me
and an eyewitness,
which I now have,
Samson's going down
for murder one...
with you as an accessory.
Okay, look, I'm sorry.
I should've told you the truth.
I thought he was gonna kill me.
I've never
been to prison. Okay?
That ship's already
sailed, Porter.
Looks like you and me are gonna
spend a lot more time together.
Please, lieutenant. I only
have four more months left.
I'll do whatever
you want, please!
Goddamn it!
Mr. Samson, with the jury
having convicted you
in count one of
first-degree murder,
I sentence you to life without
the possibility of parole.
This term will run consecutive
with your initial sentence.
Mr. Porter... with the jury
having convicted you
in count one of accessory
after the fact to murder,
I sentence you to the high term
of three years.
And since Lieutenant Jackson's
testimony
was so overwhelming,
I'm adding an additional
three years
in regard to your gang
allegations.
These six years will run
consecutive
with your initial sentence.
I hope you get your life
back on track.
I heard.
I'm sorry.
What the fuck did I do
to deserve this?
No, I do not have to
face reality, Mom...!
Look at Wade! Look
at what he's become.
It happens.
It just happens.
Some people go off
the deep end...
What do you want me
to do, Mom, huh?
You want me just to
walk away, right?
You just want me to desert him?
I am sorry,
but he has deserted you.
I am trying to
get through to you.
You are 33 years old.
A single mother.
If you wait, you're gonna be
over 40 before he gets out.
And if he does
something else, what then?
You have waited in vain.
I was 26 when
your father split.
Left you and me without
a pot to piss in, remember?
I don't regret a moment of it.
Working all those years
to support us.
But take a good look
at me, Laura.
I'm 50 years old,
and I'm still alone.
I don't wanna see you
go through that.
I knew it.
She left me.
She fucking left me.
You want me to take him
to the hole?
For what?
You're letting them beat you.
Who gives a fuck.
I got nothing to go back to now.
I got fucking nothing.
You of all people should know
what that fucking feels like.
How're you holding up
in here, John?
Shouldn't you be on
that fishing boat of yours,
or taking that pretty wife
of yours on a holiday?
Well, as a matter of fact,
I was on that boat this morning.
You need a new pair of glasses?
I could get that done...
No. No, I, uh...
Sure?
kind of got
used to them being broken.
Haven't seen any of your letters
on the website lately.
Whatever debt
you think you owe me...
you paid that a long time ago.
You think that's the only reason
I keep coming back here?
No. You've been a good
friend to me, Gordon.
But, uh... you and I
both know
that you'd never see the walls
of a prison again
if it weren't for me,
and that pains me.
So... please, just...
go enjoy your life, and...
Look.
stop wasting it here.
John.
Guard.
Shh.
Hey. Hey.
It's okay. They're gonna
take him into surgery right now.
We're not allowed to
go in there with him.
Hey, Todd. Todd, hey,
it's Daddy.
It hurts.
Oh, yeah.
I know, champ.
Shh.
But you gotta be tough, okay?
They're gonna take you in there
and they're gonna
fix you up. All right?
And I'll be right here,
okay, buddy?
Shh.
I'll be right here
when you come out.
I promise.
Be tough, okay, baby?
Hey, Stace.
Hey, Stacy.
So, what happened?
He was playing in the front
yard, and he... With his friends.
He ran into the street
to chase the ball,
and this guy came plowing
around the corner,
and he didn't even brake
before he smacked into him.
And it's this motherfucker's
third DUI strike.
How do you know that?
The cops.
They're over there
guarding his fucking room
right now.
Looks like your air bag
saved you.
Yeah.
Too bad my son didn't have one.
I am so... so sorry.
How's he doing?
I don't wanna hear
your fucking bullshit, man.
I didn't mean
to hit him. I...
Shh. Shh.
You better pray...
a judge shows you leniency,
'cause I will not.
There's not a jail
or prison in this state...
that you can hide from me.
I'll put the word out that
you're a fucking pedophile.
Get a bunch of
hard-hitting gangstas
to pump your ass till you bleed to death.
Or better yet...
I got your license number
and address
from the incident report.
Maybe while you're getting
fucked up the ass
in the joint, faggot,
I'll swing by your house
and hit your fucking kids.
You just fucked with
the wrong motherfucker, son.
One fucking thing.
That's all I can ask
is one fucking thing.
I can't get...
just one fucking...
Jesus Christ. Jesus.
You got eight seconds.
Escort.
For what?!
Yeah, nigga. OG in
the house, motherfucker.
So sorry...
What's up, coz?
What's up, my nig?
Fuck you, <i>tinto.</i>
Come on, motherfucker.
Yeah, bitch, I see you.
And I got something
for your ass.
You gonna see me, motherfucker.
Yeah, you gonna see me soon.
They already gave you the keys
to the apartment, right?
Yeah. I just wish it had
more storage space.
It's cheap.
That's what matters.
And hell, there's
plenty of space here.
Oh, no. That one
actually stays here.
Aw. Thanks, honey.
Want it?
Wait. Uh. Thanks.
Why are you putting
Daddy's clothes over there?
Well... baby...
Daddy's not gonna
live with us anymore.
But you said
he was coming home.
I know. I did.
But things changed.
Honey, it's just...
Sometimes...
Sometimes, Mikey...
people... move on
to another life.
And all we can do
is say goodbye.
Is he mad at us?
No. No, baby,
Daddy loves us both
very, very much.
You know what?
We're gonna be fine.
Okay? But we can talk
about this later. Why...?
Why don't you get out
your coloring book,
and you can draw Grandma
a picture.
Okay?
Mikey?
Where are you?
Porter!
You got a visitor.
I'll give you guys
a little extra time.
Thanks.
Is everything okay?
Is Mikey all right?
Yeah. No, no, he's fine.
Didn't think I'd see you again.
Tell you the truth, me neither.
Look, I don't know what to do.
I mean, at the rate
we're going,
Mikey will be starting
junior high
by the time you get out.
But I know that he doesn't
wanna spend
the rest of his life
without you.
And I don't either.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Your letter killed me.
I mean, if I don't have you
or Michael to come home to...
I'm not gonna make it.
It's just that any time
I hang on to any bit of hope,
it gets taken away from me.
So you tell me.
Do I wait for you?
I want you to.
But I understand if you can't.
Well, I will.
However long it takes.
I just need to know
that when you come out...
it'll be you.
Love is the most
subtle force on Earth.
It was Laura.
No shit.
Look, John...
I know you're never
getting out of here.
And I don't mean
any disrespect by it...
but this guy has robbed me
the next seven years of my life
with my family.
I can't let this happen.
Well, last time I checked, they
don't commute a man's sentence
just because he's homesick.
Unless he's got something
to barter with.
What do you mean?
What do I mean?
Expose the shit
they're pulling.
Right. But nobody's gonna risk
going against Jackson.
Not even Collins.
You've gotta think
outside these walls.
Get the right people involved...
force them to pay attention.
How?
Please. Just tell me how.
Hey, LT, how's your son doing?
Sorry.
Listen, Porter in 13
has been asking for you.
I'm in no fucking mood.
What do you want?
Ready to give you
a good show, sir.
Come again?
You know that Crip in Cell 19?
That motherfucker's one of
the reasons I'm in here.
You want a little payback, huh?
Yeah.
You put us in the yard.
Oh, it'll crack off.
I'm so sick of
all you pieces of shit.
I'll tell you what.
You wanna handle this like
a soldier so bad, you got it.
But it's my rules.
You going all the way.
What do you mean?
Whether you like it or not,
you're going into that yard.
And one of you motherfuckers
ain't coming out alive.
Even if I gotta end it myself.
Start taking
you fuckers out one by one.
You hear me?
Didn't see that one coming.
<i>You've got the
address I gave you?</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>You just make sure
you get through to him.</i>
<i>Or this doesn't work.</i>
Why risk it?
I told you that we'd wait.
For seven more years?
No, baby. What
they did was wrong.
<i>It's not fair to either
of us, or Mikey.</i>
What if something happens
though? What if they find out,
and then you never
make it out of here?
I'm coming home.
<i>Just make sure you don't go
to anyone in Corrections.</i>
We don't know who we can trust.
Can I help you?
Mr. Camrose?
Yeah.
Crack 13!
Let's go, Smith. Right
there. Right there. Stop.
Let's go.
Two steps back.
I know what's going on.
Don't do it.
Even if you win, you're
throwing the rest of
your life away, all right?
Hey, what do you care?
You're just like them.
I'm not like them.
Then do something about it.
Are you sure Wade said
it was happening this morning?
Uh, he said that they
take him to the yard at 8.
If he doesn't go through
with that fight,
all we have is
circumstantial evidence.
We need to seize
those yard tapes
before they have
a chance to erase 'em.
Whatever happens
does not leave this car.
Copy that.
When your life is defined
by a single action...
you change the concept of time.
Yeah, motherfucker.
Here we go.
You really think it's smart
to have 'em all in the yard?
If I have to take one of these
assholes out myself...
we write it off that we stopped
a riot.
Looks like Porter bit off
more than he could chew.
Okay, I think he got
the point. Let's stop it.
No.
Now.
Go ahead.
You do it,
or the next one does not miss.
Not worth it.
Get down.
Fellas, okay, fuck that shit.
If they want <i>sangre</i>
on their <i>manos,</i>
<i>ale,</i> we'll give them <i>sangre.</i>
Let it go, Bill.
They'll whack us, our families.
It's not worth it.
You know it.
Let it go.
Clear the yard.
Move it.
Cell 13, off the yard!
Do you think it worked?
Depends on whether your girl
got through to Gordon.
I can't believe
you got 'em all to stand.
Easy.
Only one thing they hate
more than each other: cops.
Especially Jackson.
Both of you. Back in
the fucking yard now.
Move your fucking asses!
It's gonna be all right, honey.
You got me, Diaz?
Affirmative, LT.
They fucking twitch,
I'll waste 'em.
Oh, fuck. Bill.
I'm gonna go to the infirmary.
Got something going on
with my throat.
That's what my report
will reflect.
Open the yard door.
Holy fuck, we're in it now.
You fuckers think anybody cares
if you make a stink?
Nobody gives a shit about you.
You see, the thing is,
I got you two,
on camera, leaving
the yard alive.
So if anybody checks my report,
they'll see that old boy here
showed his true colors
in the sally port,
stuck this bone crusher
in your ear.
Of course, we had to take
him out with the Mini-14.
And the shitty thing
about it is...
they'll just send me
two fresh new assholes
to replace you by sundown.
Ah!
LT!
You fucking...
You think... God...
will let me see my family now?
Yeah.
You...
John?
John.
I fucking knew
you weren't with us!
Guess what, Diaz?
The car just crashed.
Oh, fuck.
I've locked down the SHU.
Alert all sections.
I'm headed in there now.
Camrose, what...?
What are you doing here?
I'm Agent Skiletti with the FBI.
We need to talk to you.
I'm sorry, guys, I have
an emergency.
I need get to...
This is a federal inquiry, warden.
You need to tell me what that
emergency is.
I have one dead lieutenant,
one inmate.
What are their names?
Lieutenant Bill Jackson.
Inmate's Smith.
John Smith.
I wanna see the surveillance
tapes of the SHU yard
before anyone touches 'em.
H-how do you know
it happened in the yard?
Collins.
You weren't with them.
Everyone knows it.
You think that matters?
They'll run me out of here
quicker than you, Porter.
Won't be a prison in
the system that'll touch me.
Now what do I do?
And you knew nothing about this?
I was in the infirmary,
just like my report says.
Look. I fail to see why the FBI
thinks they have to get involved
before my people finish.
After what I just saw?
We're involved.
And let me make this clear,
Wade Porter is now
a federal witness.
And I want him in
protective custody
until he's released.
Camrose. How did you know it
was gonna happen before the fact?
Sorry. He's not at liberty
to disclose that.
That's part of
our investigation.
You know what
amazes me, Frank...
is that you didn't know.
All right, Wade's been put
into protective custody.
Nothing'll happen
to him in there.
I'm also gonna push
for his extra time
to be commuted
for his testimony.
Well, w-what does
that mean?
Means he'll get out the minute
his original sentence is up.
Which is less than
three months, right?
Oh, my God.
Thank you.
This was left in your cell.
Thanks.
I'm Gordon Camrose.
A friend of John's.
Oh, hey... Hey, Gordon.
Nice to meet you.
Thank you so much
for getting involved.
Yeah. Sure.
I heard you were a captain.
Yeah. I guarded John
for 20 years.
I spent more time
with him than I did
with my own family, seems like.
He, uh...
saved me from a sticking.
I don't know if
he ever told you that.
No.
Yep.
I'd have been dead for sure.
Hm.
Though it ain't
the only reason I...
watched out for him.
And I tried to
explain that to him, and...
He was one of my true friends.
Mine too.
Son of a bitch
never told me anything
about this the last time
I saw him, you know.
Then, heh, your fiancée
came out of the blue, you know.
Oh, she wanted me
to tell you...
Uh... she wanted me to give you
a little message, uh,
about setting up
a new wedding date for you.
Heh.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Yeah, Wade.
You get some rest now, okay?
Hey, uh...
John went out the way
he wanted.
They never broke him.
No.
No, they didn't.
<i>Usually I'm quoting
someone else's words.</i>
The least I can do is give you
<i>some John Smith originals.</i>
<i>They won't be poetic.</i>
<i>But they'll be the truth.</i>
Close 13!
What's up, come on, man.
I'm supposed to be in PC
the rest of my fucking term.
Jackson said...
Jackson's dead.
You can get up.
<i>Yes, prison desensitizes you.</i>
<i>But it also forces you to see</i>
<i>what's most important.</i>
<i>Family. And loyalty.</i>
<i>Because a con like you knows
neither exists in this place.</i>
<i>So don't run from who
you've become, felon.</i>
<i>Embrace it.</i>
<i>Grow from it.</i>
<i>And you'll never lose sight
of what truly matters.</i>
<i>That's my final piece
of advice, Wade Porter.</i>
<i>You protect your
family at all costs.</i>
<i>Even if you're forced
to kill again.</i>
<i>Because if I had
to, I'd wipe out</i>
<i>the whole planet
to get mine back.</i>
<i>So long, friend.</i>
