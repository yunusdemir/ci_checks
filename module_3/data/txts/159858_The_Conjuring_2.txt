<font color=#00FFFF>Behind the doors of this
seemingly normal house</font>

is a family living in a nightmare.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>HAZEL: I look up, and through the window,
plain as day, I see the younger girl,</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Janet, being thrown around in the air
like she was floating.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>So we run back inside and sure enough</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>there's little toy LEGO bricks
flying all around the room.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>One of them hit me right in the face
so hard it drew blood.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>CONSTABLE HEEPS:
I saw the chair slide by itself,</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>across the floor,
a distance of several feet.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>I checked the chair for wires,
but could find nothing to explain it.</font>

<font color=#00FFFF>and has been investigating these claims
for the Society of Psychical Research.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Well, I don't think there's
any doubt about it at all.</font>

in this case is absolutely staggering.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>But, Anita Gregory, a parapsychologist and
lecturer at the Polytechnic of North London,</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>is not convinced.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Our principal characters here
are all children.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>And children can be
very ingenious pranksters.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>At the center of these frightening
activities is 11-year-old Janet Hodgson.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>I recently interviewed Janet

<font color=#00FFFF>PEGGY: Thank you very much.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>- VIC: How you doing? You all right?
- I'm all right. How are the kids?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>VIC: Yeah. They're fine.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>MAURICE: Here we are.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>(COUGHS)</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>There we go.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Ed, we've managed to capture
some amazing things.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>I think you'll be very
impressed when you see.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>ED: Great. I'd like to listen
to those tapes again, too.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>You've got some really
interesting stuff in there.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>MAURICE: Vic Nottingham. Hi, Vic.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>How are you? Ed Warren.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Hello, Ed.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>How are you?
And this is Peggy, Peggy Hodgson.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>- Nice to meet you. Ed Warren.
- How do you do?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>- This is my wife, Lorraine.
- How do you do?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>- Hello.
- Hello.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Well, I'll be off then, Peg.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Will you tell the kids I said hello?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Yeah. Of course, I will. Nice to meet you.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>- Nice meeting you.
- You too, hon.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>- So, here we are, Peggy.
- All right. Do come in.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>PEGGY: It's just me and Janet here now.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>My other kids are staying with them.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>This is where the girls used to sleep,
but we don't use it anymore.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Why not?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Well, most of the activity
centered in this room.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>We were quite afraid
that someone might get hurt,</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>which is why we keep it locked.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>I understand that Janet has levitated.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Did that happen in here as well?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>- Yeah, more than once.
- Yeah.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>We've got photographs of that as well.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>ED: I'd like to hear Mrs. Hodgson's story
from her, if you don't mind.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>PEGGY: The neighbors donated them
and I hung them up,</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>hoping they'd keep things
from moving around.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Has it worked?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>No. We can hear it all night.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>(SIGHS)</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>(SWING CREAKS)</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Hi, there. I'm Lorraine.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Mind if I have a seat?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Do you know why I'm here?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Well, your mom has told me
about what's been going on</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>and I'm here to help, if I can.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Would you like to talk about it?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>You know, when I was about your age,
um, I was visiting my mom at a hospital</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>and I saw an angel.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Yeah.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>It was standing next to
a little boy's bed.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>It was just gently touching his cheek
and then it stopped.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>And it looked right at me.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Of course, my mom and the nurses
did not believe me,</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>but I knew it was real.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Look, I know how it is.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>I know what it's like to lose your friends
because you're different.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>But I also know that
one person can change everything.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>And you just have to open up to them.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>How did you know you could trust
the people you opened up to?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>I didn't.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Sometimes I got hurt.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>And it took a long time,</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>but I finally found someone
who believed me.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>What did you do then?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>I married him.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>I'm just so tired.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>I can't sleep here.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>I used to go to the medical room at school
and they let me sleep there</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>because I was so worn out.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>But now I can't even do that.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Everyone's afraid of me.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>I got no friends.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>No place I can go to.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>It makes me feel like I'm not normal.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>You know, whatever is doing this to you
wants you to feel this way.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>But why?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Because that's what makes it stronger.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>PEGGY: Around the time this all started,</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Janet started waking up here
in the middle of the night.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>This is the spot that Janet said
Bill Wilkins died, right here.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>- (SIGHS)
- Where'd you get it from?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Uh...</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>My ex-husband bought all the furniture
with the house when we moved in.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>If you don't mind me asking...</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Uh, is your ex-husband
still in the picture?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Nope.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>I'm sorry to hear that.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Any chance of reconciliation?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>He had twins with a woman
from round the corner.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>So I'm gonna take that as a "no."</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>- Yeah, it's been a lot to deal with.
- Hmm.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>He took all the music the day he left.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>I know it must feel like that sometimes...</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>No. I mean, literally.
He took all the records.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>My kids used to love listening
to his Elvis collection.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>- They've been through so much.
- Hmm.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>And now, all this is happening on top.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Yeah. The timing isn't a coincidence.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Negative entities often
feed off emotional distress.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>They like to kick you when you're down.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>That hardly seems fair.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>No, it really isn't.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>LORRAINE:
Do you know when the voice is gonna speak?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Sometimes.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>And when it does, does it feel
like it's coming from inside you?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>No.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>More like it's coming from behind me.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Like I'm being used.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Does it ever say things just to you?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>That only you can hear?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>What does it say?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>It said it wants to hurt you.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>When did it say that?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Right now.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>(THUNDER RUMBLES)</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>PEGGY: Do we really need that?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>ED: We'd like to be
able to prove to the Church</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>that she's not making the voice herself.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>So, by holding the water in her mouth,</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>we'll be able to show
that it's not some form of ventriloquism.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Does she have to be in the chair?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Just...</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>It makes me sick to see her
sitting there like that.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>We know it's hard, but the spirit
has shown an attachment to this spot.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>It'll be easier for Ed to contact it
if she's sitting there.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>You'll be all right.</font>

<font color=#00FFFF>You ready for this?</font>

with this girl and her family?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>It says it won't talk with you
all looking at me like this.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Strange! I wonder why not?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>It's not been shy about
talking up until now.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>How about if we all turn our backs?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Think it'll speak if we do that?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Maybe.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Well...</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Let's try this again.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>(SIGHS)</font>

<font color=#00FFFF>BILL: Is that what I am?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Is that what I'm doing?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Yes.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>And I have come to put a stop to it.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Do you know who I am?</font>

<font color=#00FFFF>Ed is fine.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Your father called you Edward.</font>

<font color=#00FFFF>(SIGHS) Come on, Bill.
You're not a psychiatrist</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>and I'm not here to talk about my father.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Let's get down to business,
what do you say?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Hmm?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Why don't you
just leave these people alone?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>BILL: Because this is my house!</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>It's not your house.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>BILL: Yes, it is.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>I come here to see my family,</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>but they're not here now.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>That's because you're dead.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>If your family did live here,
they're long gone now.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>(BILL GRUNTING)</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>BILL: Where are they?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>I don't know.
If I did, maybe I could help you.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>BILL: I don't need your help.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Then why don't you just move on?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>BILL: I don't believe in that.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Why not, hmm?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>What would be so wrong
with going to heaven?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>BILL: I am not</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>a heaven man!</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Well, I got news for you, Bill.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>You see, I don't care what you believe in.</font>

<font color=#00FFFF>LORRAINE: No, just the opposite.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>I'm not sensing anything.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>We could be looking
at hysterical neurosis.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>That would explain
the multiple personalities</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>and hallucinations.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>That doesn't feel right, either.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Well...</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>I can't explain it.
My heart is telling me to believe them.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>I heard that voice with my own ears,</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>but all I can sense is their own fear.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>I can't seem to see beyond that.</font>

<font color=#00FFFF>(INDISTINCT TALKING)</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>GRAHAM: This is the bite wound
Janet received the first night.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>It's faded a bit here,
but you can still make it out.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Wow. That's pretty distinctive.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Two missing teeth.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>MAURICE: That's right. And it's too big
for one of the children.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>You think this was the spirit?
This Bill Wilkins?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>I tracked down the home owner.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>And it turns out,
the owner's father lived there.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>His name was William Wilkins and he died
of a hemorrhage in the brain in that chair.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Everything she said is true.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>All public information, by the way.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>She could have heard
the whole story from a neighbor.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>LORRAINE: And what about the claims</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>that Janet has been teleporting
around the house in her sleep?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>About as valid as their claims
of her levitating off the bed.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Were any of you there when it happened?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>No. But I have pictures of that too.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Yeah. There you go.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>I set my camera up in the girls' room</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>and then waited downstairs
with the remote control.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>And fired it off whenever
I heard any commotion.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>I have to admit.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>The way her knees are bent,
the upright position of her body.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>It looks like she's just jumping.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>What are you saying?
I mean, you were there last night.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>You saw it with your own eyes.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Well, Peggy was the one who
saw someone attacking Janet.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>But she teleported herself into a room</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>locked from the outside,
for goodness' sake.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>And what about her voice?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>How do we explain that?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>I think the first time
she was making that voice</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>it was in front of television cameras.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>And she couldn't do it with water
in her mouth until you looked away.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>So she could have spit it out,
taken another sip before you turned back.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Last year, I was conned by a Welsh family
pretending to be possessed by demons.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>(SCOFFS) Honestly,
I don't know what was worse,</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>the demons or the people who prey
on our willingness to believe in them.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>The demons are worse.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>But you must admit, it is suspicious.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>You sincerely believe
that she's faking everything?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>And what about Peggy?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>She's just using the whole
thing as an excuse</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>to get better housing from the council.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>She's already applied!</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Look, I'm not saying it's a hoax.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Sometimes, what we do
requires a leap of faith.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>To believe when nobody else will.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>ANITA: So you really do believe them?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Yes. We do.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>But the Church can't do
anything without proof.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>That's what we need.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Right, listen. I'll make
some telephone calls,</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>see if I can get hold of some
video recording equipment.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>In the meantime, Ed and I can be
spending time with Peggy and the kids,</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>because they need to be a family again.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Hi, Mom! We're back!</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>PEGGY: What are you doing back?</font>

bothered by a bully?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Pete, at school.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>He's always picking on Billy.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>And, dear, tell me, what do
you do when that happens?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>(STAMMERS) They stick up for me.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Good, because the spirit in this house</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>- is a lot like that bully.
- Yes.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>ED: And he's got it in for Janet.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>So you guys gotta stick up for her,
the same way they stick up for you.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Family sticks together.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>This, on the other hand, is a lost cause.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Oh, bloody hell.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>We've had all sorts of things stop working</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>- for no reason at all.
- Mmm.</font>

one way or another.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Whose guitar is that?</font>

<font color=#00FFFF>JANET: Why do you do this?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Help people like us?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>When you were little, did you ever
worry that there might be something</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>hiding under your bed at night?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Yeah? Well...</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>My bed actually had something under it.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Yeah.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Something grabbed my hand
and yanked me right to the floor.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>It was too dark to see under there, but
let me tell you, I ran out of there so fast.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>You know what my dad did?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>He dragged me right back into the room
and told me I had to face my fears.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>And I was scared to death.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>But then I remembered
what this nun had told me in catechism.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>"God will be there for all who need."</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>So, I grabbed this crucifix
out from my nightstand, right?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>And I tell whatever's under there</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>that it better leave,
or God was gonna kick its butt.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>(CHUCKLES)</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Best thing my dad ever did for me.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Of course he only did it
because he really didn't believe me.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>It took me years
to finally find someone who did.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>And you know what I did then?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>You married her?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>So you've heard this story before?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>(CHUCKLES)</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>All right.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>PEGGY: How you getting on in here?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Hey. We're done here.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Fixed the closet door, too.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>And if you'd like, I could take a look
at the washing machine.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>No, I couldn't ask you to do that.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>It's a disaster down there.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Come on. How bad can it be?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Oh.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Bloody hell.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Everything still quiet in there?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Yes. Thank goodness. Yes.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>It would be something though, wouldn't it?</font>

beyond a shadow of a doubt</font>

<font color=#00FFFF>(SIGHS)</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>It would be historic.</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Is that why you're doing this?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Because you want to be a part
of something historic?</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>This isn't a laboratory,
this is someone's house.</font>

is the only thing that matters.</font>

<font color=#00FFFF>Yeah, but there have been literally
dozens of genuine incidents.</font>
