It's not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me
tell you where I'm at
You don't have to
worry 'cause I'm coming
Back to where I should
have always stayed
And now I've heard the
maybe to your story".
Those Happy Days
Can it be I stayed away too long
Did I leave your mind when I was gone
It's not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me
tell you where I'm at
I wanna wanna be where you are
Oh
Anywhere you are
Oh oh oh
I wanna wanna be where you are
Oh oh
Baby where you are
Oh oh oh
Paris, July 3, 1992
- You'll be careful.
- Dad. I'm not a kid anymore.
No need to meet me after.
I'll manage.
You should go now.
It doesn't look good.
- I get the message.
- Dad...
- You'll be glad to have it.
- I'll be in touch.
- Don't worry. I'll call you.
- I'm not worried.
Off you go now. It's okay.
Departure is a key moment.
so we have to stay focused.
We're courteous with the parents
and remember
never answer a question
with "l don't know."
For instance, "What's
the weather like there?"
You answer: "Sunny." Okay?
Let's try it.
Joseph pretend I'm a parent.
- Okay.
- Hello sir.
- Hello sir.
- How will we know
the kids have arrived?
- I suggest you listen to the radio.
They do news flashes for disasters.
(laughter)
- Very funny.
Caroline, you collect the luggage
from the parents.
Okay?
You're following this?
- Yes.
- How's the weather?
- I
-I don't know.
- Okay.
Truman, you can load the luggage.
- Excellent.
- Those little bells are great!
- Yeah.
- They're fun.
Nadine, get the red forms.
Can you give the bells a rest?
- Sorry.
- I don't have your first
-aid diploma.
It's a legal obligation.
- Actually, I don't have it.
I failed the exam.
- You're not serious?
- I've studied medicine.
- Year one, twice.
- Isn't there a new girl?
- She's not here yet.
I don't even know her.
I'm pretty mad.
- She's got a nerve.
- ls that her?
- Hi! I'm looking for Vincent Rousseau.
- Here, and he's mad!
- It's okay, Nadine.
I'm the director and er...
Lisa, you're late.
You're off to a bad start.
- Sorry to interrupt.
but I think the cavalry's here.
- I'm Mrs Marciano. My son, Steve.
You're the director? Very young.
- Don't worry.
- I wanted to tell you...
Steve doesn't eat pork.
- No problem.
- Toplexil... Are they pills?
- No, it's syrup.
- Syrup? ls it strong?
- You have bunks?
- Bunks? Yes, of course.
They're some of the local wildlife.
Like turtle doves,
albatrosses and tawny owls.
We even saw a tapir once.
hiding in a bush.
- Being anxious is normal.
Accept that to overcome it.
- Sorry, no parents on
board, that's the rule.
- Hey, that's mine!
- This case is empty!
- Mr Pichavent, the child psychiatrist.
It reassures the child.
This way, he thinks I'm going too.
- He always loses his
things at summer camp.
So I had an idea this year.
- Youssef, time to go!
That's great!
(speaking Arabic)
Nice and clear on the back.
We can't miss him, unless
there's another Youssef.
He's the only one!
- This is Guillaume
Joyadet, with a "J."
- With a "J" okay.
- And Timothy, his Belgian pen
-pal.
He's a bit odd.
- A pain in the ass!
- They don't get on.
Could they have separate rooms?
- Let's go, honey.
- Goodbye, Guillaume.
Goodbye, Timothy.
- You're in the 13
-16 group.
I'm Joseph, but you can call me JoJo.
- I'll stick to Joseph.
Such familiarity seems premature.
Maybe later. Why not?
- Why not? You're in shape.
- Yeah!
- Are you the conductor?
- The driver.
- Whatever.
I'm Mrs Marciano. How are you?
- I'm okay.
- Are you in shape?
- Yes.
- No domestic
problems? - Uh-uh.
- My son Steve is on your train.
I'll give you my mobile number.
Call me when you get there.
You're sweet.
Call me when you get there.
- Lose stuff and I'll kill you!
- Okay, I'll call
Gran and reassure her!
- Come on!
- Let go, you're hurting me!
- No parents on board!
Thank you!
Full steam ahead! Whoo-hoo!!!
- What's up, sweetheart?
- No seat.
- No seat?
I'll find you one.
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?
- Do you know if the dead
outnumber the living on earth?
I don't know...
- I've never thought about
it, but I can find out.
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Yes, Mum, everything's all right.
We haven't eaten yet.
No, I'm not speaking to strangers.
I'm not showing off.
- What's going on?
- It's my
mum-- - No mums.
You'll use a payphone like the others.
You'll get this back at the end.
- Pain in the ass!
- What? I didn't hear that.
- Nothing.
- I prefer that.
- Stop pissing me off with your bag.
Just sit down!
- Sorry, I want to change earrings.
- Spare me the life story, okay.
- Hi, girls. I'm Daniel.
I'm a group leader. Okay?
- Fine.
- Who are you?
- Camille.
- And you?
- I'm fine, thanks. Bye.
- Okay, great...
Well, Camille, I hope
you're in my group.
Catch you later.
- Bye.
- It's normal to feel anxious.
We'll have lots of fun.
You'll make loads of friends.
Put your case down.
- No!
- Let me handle this. What's up, kid?
- I want to go home!
- Put your case down and we'll talk.
- No! No!
Léave me be!
No!
Léave me be! I want to go home! No!
- I've got the case.
- Calm down, will you!
- Let me go!
- It's okay, everything's fine.
Everything's fine.
Let go!
Everything's fine.
Let go!
- As an adolescent,
stress would make me eat.
Know how heavy I was at 16?
- No idea. 90 pounds or so?
- 190 pounds.
- Really! That much?
It's hard imagining that now.
- I got treatment and
people changed attitude.
- I bet. I mean, people are dumb.
What can you do?
- You wouldn't have looked at me then.
- Don't be so sure.
But you're planning on
staying like this now?
We can get somewhere now.
- Daniel's tuna and mayo
or sardines and butter?
- Sardines for me.
- Everything okay?
- Not bad.
Thanks.
- I think I need to
set things straight.
You're a group leader.
You smoke and chat in the evening.
You're here for the kids.
That's what the job is, okay?
- The kids aren't going to fly away.
- I can tell we'll get on.
- Me too!
- The director?
I wanted a word.
- What?
- I just want to check on Benoît...
- You're not going in there!
We look after children, not parents.
This is absurd!
- I'm Mr Pichavent.
- No parents. -
Pierre-Emmanuel--
- I don't care who you are.
You get off at the next stop.
- You don't understand.
- I do. Perfectly. No parents on board.
1, 2, 3...
- Vincent, the nylon
bag goes in the hold?
- Yeah. You're 8?
9, 10, 11 ...
Nadine, help me.
Let's go!
Caroline, no trips empty-handed.
- Thanks.
- Who's Camille Lipman?
- That's me.
- Funny, we have the same bag.
- Yeah.
- See that look? You're in!
- You're crazy, too young for me.
- Okay
- boys, first floor; girls, second!
- All the way up, girls.
- Boys, first;
girls, second.
- Hurry it up, girls!
- Oreillons, Guerin, Rodriguez and Lapique,
the "Vaucluse" room.
- Pechenet,
Perrier, Marquez and Azihirat,
you're in the "Loir et Cher" room.
Now then... No, Caroline!
You're not in there, you're with us.
- I want to go home!
I don't want to stay!
- Let go!
(screaming)
- I'll show you who the boss is!
- That kid's crazy!
- Piss off.
Bottom bunk, dickhead.
I said I didn't want this guy here.
This is my space.
- Calm down, Brett Sinclair,
this is his room too and that's final.
Here's your bed. You've
10 minutes to tidy up.
Julien, downstairs in 10 minutes.
- Hi, Tim!
- Shit, can't you give me a break?
- I told you!
Not a bottom bunk!
I wanted my own room.
- So you get to decide?
Your name's embroidered
on this in gold letters?
- Exactly!
- Okay, fine.
Caroline, d'you mind having it?
- A little.
- Great, I'll take this one, then.
- Excuse me, which room
is my friend Charlotte in?
- Ah,  yes,  Charlotte...
Charlotte with a "C", right?
- Yes.
- With the juniors, in theory.
- Huh?
- Charlotte, let's see.
- Charlotte.
- Charlotte. Geraldine...
- My friend Charlotte.
- It's the only solution.
- Well, it's not bad, is it?
Listen, Charlotte,
sleep in the sickbay now
and we'll move you tomorrow.
- What about my case?
- That's right, she's lost her case.
- Are you sure you had one?
- Of course she had one.
We'll find it. We'll look for your case.
Wait here for us?
- With the French-language
youth-and-sports programme,
This year, our friend Truman!
This year, our friend Truman!
- Hi!
- In the sombrero,
we have Joseph! (applause)
And our deputy director, Daniel.
(whooping)
Do you have any questions before dinner?
All right, go ahead.
- How many men and women
live in this region?
In percentages, of course.
I don't know...
- I'll put it
differently. Any questions
related to camp organization?
Go ahead.
- Got train times to Paris?
- Three weeks?
- What?
- Are showers compulsory?
- ls there a parcel for me?
- I've lost my case.
- Can I change rooms?
(children): Me too!
- Fine, we're settling in.
I really don't have
time to talk now, Dad.
I don't know...
Go for walks, see a movie...
You're bored, okay,
but it's not my fault.
I'll call you back, sir.
I didn't introduce myself. I'm Vincent.
- Mimoun, I'm new here.
- I heard. ls the other cook okay?
- Just a broken arm.
- Have you worked in
a summer camp before?
- Not really.
Like I told the job office,
I was a chef in Paris.
The Chinks bought us out and fired me.
I couldn't do spring rolls. (laughing)
- Well... Sorry.
Have you prepared the menus?
- Here you go.
This is the whole first week.
- All right.
Rich, isn't it?
- No.
- Here.
- Help yourselves and pass it on.
- These are her pills.
(chattering)
- Didn't you have a sore throat?
No, blisters! I saw to them.
- Stop asking me!
I don't know who invented mittens.
- You'll ruin your ears with that.
- He's right. Besides,
it's not very polite.
- And my dad said
it can damage your
hearing. I don't know.
- Know what? If you
don't know, clam up!
- She's right.
I don't know...
Truman, you were with Joseph.
There was no one at Guillaume's table,
so I had to sit there.
- His dumb questions get on my nuts.
- He's a pain.
He asked me if I was born black!
- We all prefer the easier kids.
Lisa, you're cute, the kids
like you, but it's not enough.
- I should apologize?
- I wanted to say...
In relation to...
- To what?
- Er...
To...
- To what?
- Nothing.
- Benoît Pichavent. l
wanted to bring him up,
because I've checked his prescription
and it's disturbing.
These are his health records.
I found Xanax and Lexomil in his bags.
I think his parents fooled us.
In my opinion, he's hyperactive.
- I agree with tubby.
He's asleep now,
after yelling all day.
I'm trying to reach out to him.
- She's Nadine.
- I don't feel right stuffing him
full of this chemical shit.
I think we should try
more natural remedies.
- Stick to the prescription.
- Okay.
- Another important reflex:
count them all the time...
coming in, on the bus, at meals...
I'll do it at the beginning,
but learn to do it too.
(knocking)
(barking)
- Good evening. Police.
He was at the station.
He'd walked there from here.
It's a 12-mile hike.
(barking)
- Benoît...
Congratulations!
You've done it! He found the way!
He's won our treasure hunt!
- The treasure hunt!
- A treasure hunt?
- With his case?
- Who's in charge?
- He's the director.
- That's me.
- Come to see us tomorrow.
- I want to leave!
- Yes, I'll come tomorrow.
Thank you and good night.
- Good night.
- My dad'll sue you.
- Truman, can you put him to bed?
Thanks, Joseph, that was smart.
Dear parents, hello,
Today, Tuesday, July 10,
this is Vincent Rousseau, the director,
The weather is splendid,
The children are enjoying the fresh air
in a merry, happy atmosphere.
Each child is settling in,
- What's up?
- Take me home!
- A warm atmosphere
reigns at the chateau.
- You know Flaubert loved Belgium?
- Clam up!
- Yeah, you're pissing us all off.
- Our sporting activities have begun
with the group leaders,
who try to involve everyone
so no one is left on the sidelines.
Our cook Mimoun treats us every day
to his tasty and balanced meals.
- Cabounia royal! (screaming)
- The children appreciate the aromas
and flavours of a cuisine
rarely found in summer camps.
The whole group is well
and has the perfect conditions
to release the tension
of the school year.
We have launched our
educational project,
entertaining but always educating,
in an atmosphere of calm,
serenity and discipline. (screaming)
Sue me, I'm hanging up anyway!
Remember, the phone line
is reserved for emergencies.
So cut the umbilical cord.
Stop it, Dad. I can't help.
Call Andre. He should be back.
He's with his son? That
guy's just a layabout.
I'll call you back.
I'm not hanging up on you, okay!
(children laughing outside)
Hey!
You think that's funny?
- Uh-uh.
- Spit it out. Who was it?
- We were just playing a game.
- Tell me or the whole
group gets it. Who was it?
- It was me.
I don't know my own strength.
- It's a pane of
glass, it's no big deal.
- Thanks for your support!
Come here a second.
We have to follow a set of rules.
We never argue in front of them.
It's anti-educational.
We'll talk about it later.
- We didn't argue. (crash)
- I just can't control myself!
- Brilliant!
- Cool off in here a while.
Then we'll see if you control yourself.
(sighing)
(chattering)
- Stop! Shht! Okay.
Where did you hurt? l
can't find your pills.
- I forget.
- Have a glass of water, then.
- Have you got a
second? My throat's sore.
- Your throat's sore?
- Yeah.
- Let me have a look.
- Outside.
- Sit down, I'll be right back.
Are you coughing or is it just sore?
- Take a look.
- It's a bit red, but...
- Come closer. Look.
- Maybe you have a bad tooth, but...
Maybe it's the pace of
things wearing you out.
Are you crazy?
- Mimoun, this is important.
Lamb stew, couscous, fritters...
The menus have to be a lot simpler.
They need more balance.
- Thanks, baby. (laughing)
- Listen, the menus have
to be more traditional.
I don't know... Mashed potatoes,
green beans, salad... Balanced.
- Oh, wow...
Daniel's got a way with girls.
- I have other fish to fry.
Yes, here we are.
The oil...
Almost 100 pints in
a week. Are you crazy?
- You fancy her.
- I don't.
- I've seen you looking
at her. Know what?
- No.
- Make her laugh.
That's what women like.
Drink up. Remember, make them laugh.
(glasses clinking)
- To you.
- He's starting to piss me off.
Benoît, come here!
- Take your T
-shirt off!
- Ouch!
- Shit, what's this?
- Why are you here?
- Why aren't you at dinner?
- I dreamt of a bright, white
light at the end of a tunnel.
It was brilliant.
- Taste the coriander and saffron?
- Yes, I can.
- One more mouthful for me.
- Really, Mimoun,
don't you think I'm fat enough already?
- No. (Arabic music on the radio)
- If you move away from the left,
you approach the right.
Then you have the
centrists in the centre.
Conservatives on the right.
They're the bosses,
executives'
rich people, like.
And over here, the far right.
Yes?
- Timothy Van Hollander, Antwerp.
My dear Daniel, your
vision seems to be...
unsophisticated.
- It does?
But why?
(sighing deeply)
- I could watch you eat for hours.
You're beautiful when you eat.
(Arabic music on the radio)
- In talking about the
Left, you can't compare
Germany's SPD, England's Labour Party
and the Swedes with their welfare state.
- The welfare state?
- It's English for
health care and so on.
Lisa, what's up?
Aren't you interested?
You keep talking!
If I may...
- Yes?
- Your overview seems...
a little
cut-and-dried.
Let me make two points...
- Enough, Timothy!
It's time to hear from your comrades.
A rather Stalinian
term, but I'll step down.
- Sure, step down.
- Yes, Camille.
- Racism is down to ignorance and
stupidity, but we're all human.
- Yes, Camille, absolutely! (applause)
- Wait! Wait!
Hackneyed views like
that won't change things.
You can spare us that crap.
- Calm down.
Guillaume has something to say.
- I think we should fingerprint
all Arabs and Blacks,
all foreigners who
arrive in France by plane
or by train,
so that in cases of aggression or theft,
the police could compare prints
to make their work easier.
I don't know...
(booing)
- Racist!
- You're crazy!
- Sometimes we don't realize
how serious our words are.
- My dad says that all the time.
- No reason to repeat it.
Your father has his views
and you have to forge your own.
You have to learn to distance
yourself from your parents.
Okay, get to bed now.
- I'm not tired.
I slept all day in the laundry room.
- What room are you in?
- The Var.
- Right, all fascists down south.
Go on now.
Julien, Tony, get to your room.
Timothy, finish that tomorrow.
Lights out in five minutes.
I'm counting on you.
- You're kidding?
- You're not in bed yet?
- Lisa said we could stay.
- Get to your rooms.
What the hell is this?
Get to bed!
- See you tomorrow.
- You can say goodbye
tomorrow. Move it!
- Wait for me!
- What a pain!
- I must be dreaming!
Flog them hash, why don't you?
- What's your problem now?
I can't do anything right with you.
I always screw up.
You're going to vent your anger on me
for three weeks?
You love playing the chief?
If your life's shit, don't blame me.
- You're smoking
with 13-year-olds!
Setting an example?
- Piss off with your theories.
They smoked before meeting me.
I'm just trying to bond with them.
They're not in a reform home!
- Listen to me,
show some ambition with the kids
or you'll be out of your depth.
They'll show no gratitude.
They'll make a fool of you.
I'm saying that to help you.
And, by the way, my life is just fine.
- Finished?
Can I go to bed now, chief?
- That's a dumb way to react.
The answer's no.
We have a meeting in 10 minutes.
- I'm dumb, then.
- We're having a day by the sea!
(screams of joy)
Calm down!
I want you all to behave
and stick together! Got that?
(children): Yes!
- All here.
- I didn't hear.
- They're all here.
- None missing.
- Happy?
(children): Yes!
- Check done, we can go.
- Okay.
I go to the market to buy some spuds
I go to pay and my wallet's gone
(singing together)
Repeat after me
(singing together)
I go to the movies",
(singing together)
Achille?
- Don't piss me off!
(singing)
The whole bus now!
- Achille, have there been many crashes
on this road this year?
- Vincent, tell him to
stop busting my balls!
- Sit down.
Sit down, son. (laughter)
- Vincent? Vincent?
Is there a life after death?
- I've no idea.
Give me a break with these
questions all the time!
Don't all these questions wear you out?
And take that mask off, it's...
- I like my mask.
- Yeah...
Having my life
Marked by your presence
Holding a light that shines
Opting for the ways of trust with you
Loving and knowing I'm loved
(continues to sing with a shaky voice)
- Caroline, excuse me. That's pretty.
Don't you know anything
a bit more bouncy?
- I don't know the rest.
- Too bad. Finish that one, then.
- I've finished anyway.
- Okay, bravo, that was really great.
Let's hear it for
Caroline! (light applause)
- Vincent?
- Yeah?
- I know you don't like me doing it,
but I've reduced Benoît's doses.
- Huh?
- I gave him chamomile and cherry
-stem tea.
It won't do any harm.
- Very clever. Still, he can last
a day. He seems to be doing better.
- He's relaxing, he's having fun.
- See, it doesn't matter.
He's a cute kid, huh?
- Let go!
- Benoît, calm down!
- Let go of the armrest!
It's me, Truman!
(screaming)
- Benoît, stop it!
- Let go!
- He's crazy!
- Let go, I said!
- I think her head hit the window hard.
- It's her thumb that worries me.
Is your thumb any better?
- No, it hurts.
- It hurts.
- My problem is the
jerk ate my armrests.
- Thanks for coming so quickly.
How's Benoît?
- With that shot,
he'll sleep all day.
- What do we do about the armrests?
- I don't know. And the kid's thumb?
- She's off to hospital.
I've bandaged it for now.
We'll need one of you too.
- I'll go.
- No, Nadine, I'll see to it.
- Armrests cost a bomb.
- I don't care!
- Who'll pay?
- Daniel, take over and watch out.
- I'm onto it.
- Here, her health records.
- Thanks. See you later.
I'm counting on you.
- Okay.
- See you.
- Let's go. Sit down.
- With Vincent away, I'm in charge.
I don't want to hear a sound!
Achille, let's go.
- Okay, boss.
She's unique.
I've never seen a case
like it in ten years!
- It's a sprain?
- It's a mallet finger?
Crossed ligaments. Usually
only old people get it.
My students have to see it.
It's a textbook case, it's so rare.
(door opening)
- Where's the mallet finger?
- Over there.
- What can we do, then?
- Nothing. Splints for
six months at least.
- Six months?
- She's young, she'll be okay.
Luckily, it's her left hand.
- Charlotte?
Which hand d'you write with?
- The left.
- Brilliant...
(Quebec folk song)
- All together now!
- I reckon it's a wash
-out.
The red flag's up.
- Shall we go back? I'm beat.
- Maybe you should
have paid to be here.
- What's so funny?
We're here like jerks!
- Don't get carried away.
We'll think of something.
- I know a fun thing to do.
We take school groups there.
- Great.
- ls it under cover?
- Of course it is.
- Oh!
He's pissing us all off!
Can't one of you shut him up?
- Okay, let's go.
(Truman continues singing)
- Welcome to the carpet
-slipper museum.
First of all, you need to know
that the first slipper workshops
were founded
in our fine region
between 1880 and 1910.
- Are we there?
- No. Hush...
- From the start of the century,
the sales of slippers
progressed in leaps and bounds.
The carpet slipper was born.
It brought wealth
to the upper Perigord until the slump
of the 1970s.
Yes, children!
I'll have you know that nowadays
the workshops for carpet slippers
that are fully stitched
can be counted on the
fingers of one hand.
Want to borrow my finger?
- No, it's nothing serious.
It's just a slight sprain,
but I preferred to call.
It's only natural.
At the most... six days.
No, her case still hasn't arrived.
On top of this.
Your husband's a rheumatologist?
That's incredible.
I'll fax the prescription.
No problem.
No problem.
- The felt for carpet slippers
is made from felt fibres""
Slipper manufacture entails the use
of various animal hairs:
sheep, goat,
ox, rabbit,
beaver, coypu,
camel, yak,
lama,
and even hamster sometimes. (snoring)
- Are you crazy?
- Out of the way. Get up.
- It's okay.
"the friction
of the fibres"
- Careful.
"the wool and felt
are carefully prepared for twisting"
- How was it?
- The tops, really super.
- Okay?
- No.
- Lisa...
- What?
- Can I have a word with you?
- Sure...
- Let's go over here. Joseph?
- Yeah?
- Take Charlotte.
Go with Joseph.
Over here, come on.
I wanted to apologize about last night,
the night before last and
all the other nights too.
You have real potential with the kids,
they adore you.
- You're serious? You mean that?
- Yeah.
- I really glad to hear that.
- I didn't say it was perfect,
but you're really keen
and that's what counts.
- I need things explained calmly.
- I understand.
I've been a bit too tough on you.
So I wanted to tell you
that I'm available now.
That's not what I mean.
I mean, you can come to talk to me
when you need to.
- Okay, I'll remember that.
- Even late at night,
after our meeting.
I'll be there.
- That's sweet.
- Only natural. I'm
available, it's natural.
I'm the director after all.
- Yeah.
See you later, then?
- Okay, Charlotte?
You're okay.
- Please... Please, be quiet.
Quiet, please.
I'd like some quiet.
Please...
- Oh!
Quiet! (noise stops)
Quiet!
I don't want to hear another sound!
Go on, baby.
- Thanks.
As you know,
the short-stay camps start tomorrow.
Seniors will go horse-riding
and juniors to the pool.
(screams of joy)
- Hold on. In theory.
In theory,
because I may well cancel
the whole programme.
(booing)
Exactly, and some of you know why.
We've had reports of thefts
and we can't tolerate
such behaviour at this camp.
Daniel...
- We'll give you envelopes
that you'll put in this box in an hour.
Joseph will explain the idea.
- The thief puts the money in it.
It'll be anonymous, with no reprisals.
Got that?
- We're counting on you.
- You've done a crap thing!
Stealing is shit!
It'd never happen back home!
- Cut it out!
- No! Shit!
Shit, 15 and stealing!
- Stop it, calm down.
- "Daniel, you stink!"
- Let me see that.
- "Can you turn up the heat
in the sickbay? Charlotte."
- That's cute.
- "Truman, go back to the Middle Ages
and brush your teeth."
- "Congratulations to Daniel and Lisa
for snogging during the film."
- Here's a good one:
"l reject these methods
"that continue to shame France.
"informing recalls the collaborationism
"of a country faced
with a troubled past.
"For a free France.
An anonymous Belgian neighbour."
- He's not wrong. This
isn't very pedagogical.
- Why say that? We're learning things.
- We all know who took the money.
It's simple enough.
- What do you mean?
- C'mon, last year,
it was the same. It was
the reform-school kids.
I'm putting my money on Léa.
- Jesus, that's sick!
You think that way?
You should get Joseph's
fingerprints too! You never know!
- I left them on the train.
- I don't think it's funny.
- Fuck, turn it off!
- What are you doing?
- Splitting.
- Why?
- Because they'll blame me again.
- Why? It wasn't you.
Where are you going?
- I'm out of here, okay!
- You can't.
- Get off my back, Camille!
- I'm coming too, then.
- You piss me off...
- That's all I had to say. (chattering)
- All right, that's Joseph settled.
Now Caroline. Go ahead.
Anyone want to speak?
- We don't hear enough from Caroline.
- We don't know who she is.
- She's new at this,
but she lacks drive.
- Mm
-hmm.
Nothing to add?
Go ahead, Caroline, you can respond now.
- I'm sorry. I don't know what...
- You realize that's not enough?
Develop on it.
- Uh...
Well, I...
I...
I'm happy here.
- What? -
I said I'm--
- Speak up, okay!
It's a pain in the ass!
- I guess...
Actually...
I'm trying to do my best.
- Speak up, you
understand that? Speak up!
Express yourself. What's the problem?
We won't eat you!
Stop being so transparent all the time!
- Sorry.
- Stop it!
Stop apologizing! Stop being polite!
Move. I don't know... React!
Force yourself! What's inside you?
It's locked away. Want
to tell us? Answer me!
Answer me! (hitting the table)
Come on, answer me.
- I don't now...
- I'm sorry.
(sobbing)
I said it to help you.
Stop blowing your nose.
I'm talking to you. Look at me.
I said it for your sake.
The camp ends in two weeks, see.
What are you afraid of? Who?
Everyone likes you here, okay.
Daniel likes you. Truman likes you.
- Sure.
- Everyone likes you here.
- That's right. (everyone agreeing)
- I like you, Caroline.
If you're able
to let it all out, it'll
help you for years to come.
You understand? Let it out.
Let it out,
but stop blowing your nose!
- Vincent, she gets the message.
(sobbing)
- It's easy laying into her.
- Spare me your advice, okay!
(sobbing)
(owl hooting)
- ls this dangerous?
- No one made you come.
It's 12 miles to the station now. Ah!
- What are you up to?
- Turn that off!
- We raided the kitchen. Hungry?
- Don't just stand there.
- I'm not being picky,
but we had a "chore chart"
with the different jobs,
some tougher than others,
such as dishes and toilets.
I've done them three
times in the last week,
while others...
- I confess.
I can't take the smell.
- There's a problem
here and it's not Lisa.
It's time we got to the point.
- I agree.
- We talked about it earlier...
and we all agreed, Vincent.
- Okay, fine.
I'm the problem, is that it?
- Sorry, but why don't
you get criticized too?
Know what? You're too big-headed.
The bad atmosphere is your doing.
- We're out of our depth
and you're too distant.
You take yourself too seriously.
You lecture us, you're not open...
- Anything to add, Joseph?
Go on, let off steam too.
- I'm okay.
- I'll put this simply.
I run this camp the way I want.
I spent the afternoon at the hospital
after Nadine dabbled in herbal medicine.
I sleep two hours a night,
I cover for all of you...
How can I put it?
Screw you! Screw you all.
Especially you, Daniel. Screw you.
I don't need advice from some turkey
with the wits of a seagull!
- Take that back
or-- - Or what?!
Léave if you're not
happy, you gutless shit!
The door's wide open.
- You fucker!
I'll smash your face in! (screaming)
I'll smash your face in, fucker!
- Cut it out!
- Fuck!
- Shit, that's hot!
- Motherfucker!
- Fuck!
- Take it off!
- Fuck!
- I'll get some burn cream.
- It's burning my throat.
- Amsterdamer has a sting to it.
It's hard to inhale.
- Your turn now, Léa.
Truth or dare?
- Dare.
- An easy one.
Kiss Timothy on the mouth. Come on...
- No, on the cheek. (cheering)
- On the cheek suits me.
- Come on! A kiss on the cheek,
come on, a kiss! (cheering)
- Let her breathe! (laughter)
- He's as good as others,
he kisses like others.
We look like shit now.
Two points for Belgium. Shit...
- It could have been
worse. This is greasy.
- I'll see to it.
- I told you your tea's too hot.
- It's my fault now?
You nearly woke the kids with your shit!
- How's Daniel?
- I gave him two
of Benoît's pills. He's out.
- I'm sending him camping
to calm him down.
- Go anything to eat, Mimoun? Thanks.
- The pantry's been raided.
- Just what we needed...
Caroline?
- Hmm?
- Here.
- Oh, right.
- Right...
- There's no one here, Vincent.
- Hold on...
We have a lead.
- I'll go left. Go behind the trees.
- Okay.
(bells chiming)
- Hey! Got you, shrimp!
- I've done nothing!
- Know what time it is?
- No cycling at night!
- Are you crazy?
- Let go of me.
Read me my rights.
- You're nuts.
- I want to see my lawyer!
(screaming)
- Mr Pichavent? What's going on?
- I can explain...
- You're sick. You're really sick.
- It's because of Benoît.
- Benoît's fine. I'm calling the cops.
- I'm really worried.
Benoît is so fragile.
Especially now that his mother's gone.
My wife left me.
- I'm sorry,
but I can't keep you.
I'm sure you know it's
not good for Benoît.
We're doing good work with him here
and he's progressing.
- You don't have kids...
- I have 80 kids here.
- Listen, Mr Rousseau.
Actually, I've rented
a house in the village.
- No, that's not wise.
What if he sees you?
Have you thought of that?
(sighing)
- You're right.
I'll go home.
- Think of Benoît.
- Guillaume, relax! Stop tugging at it.
- Belle de Jour! (neighing)
She's crazy. I don't believe it!
Belle de Jour, calm down!
- Try to stay in line!
- Calm down!
- What have you fed her?
- Léan back!
- I need to change horses!
(neighing) She won't stop!
- Check the Belgian guy.
See that, baby?
- That's crazy.
- Yeah, crazy.
- Come on, let's go.
- I like her little...
- Stay on the track.
- Hey, Belle de Jour, what's going on?
She's going too fast!
Oh!
Whoa-oh-oh!
Shit! (laughter)
I don't believe it. Shit!
- Ah!!!
Argh!
Argh!
- Want me to come too?
- No, leave me be!
- We'll paddle. You can
come out if you want.
- I said no! Get off my back, okay!
- I promise you, you'll love it.
I swear.
Come on, for me.
- Let go!
- Benoît, pools are for kids.
In theory, you should like it.
You understand?
You know what you are?
King of the assholes
in the land of fuckwits!
A ball-busting little jerk
who pisses everyone off!
You shitty little fucker,
blubbering all bloody day!
That's what you are, asshole!
Asshole! Asshole!
Piss off, you fucker!
- You, come with me. (screaming)
(Caroline still screaming)
- Ah!!!
Attack! Ahoy, my hearty!
- Fucking jerk!
Asshole! (glass breaking)
Ouch! Shit! Shit!
Kill all these shitty kids!
(Arabic music on the radio)
- A bit of peace is good, huh?
- Mm...
- Christine has a lot of style.
- True. She has something.
- She's beautiful. You fancy her too?
- She's okay.
- I'm going to make a move.
(music)
- Nadine, why am I crying like this?
- It's normal. You
never cut onions before?
They're not easy to cut...
Pass me the tomatoes.
- I cut the quarters in two?
- What's up?
- Know what? I'm going to make my move.
- Like that? Nothing scares you.
- What?
I've done worse things,
and you can see she's dying for it.
- Don't you ever stop?
- No.
- You've got stamina.
- Shit, you were right
about that fucker Daniel!
- The group leaders are like that.
I warned you.
- How are things going with Nadine?
- I'm playing it stable.
It's off to a good start.
- Looks serious.
- She has braids,
likes Youssou N'Dour...
My folks will love her.
(chattering)
- Guillaume...
We've been looking all over for you.
Why are you on your own again?
- I wanted to be alone.
- What's wrong?
Want to talk about it?
You're down. It happens.
Tell me, what's the matter?
- I'll never find a girl.
- Why do you say that?
- Girls don't go for me.
They're not interested in me.
- Don't talk rubbish. They can.
Know how to attract them?
Do you go about it the right way?
- I asked Steve about it.
He said I ask too many questions.
Do I ask too many questions?
- No, it shows you're
curious. It's a good sign.
- Save your breath.
Girls don't like me. I'm not blind.
- That's rubbish.
You know what?
If I was 13, in this camp,
I'd like to go out with you.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- You don't mean that.
- I'm serious.
- Don't be offended, but
I don't think I'd accept.
I'd rather be friends.
If you see what I mean.
- Yes, sure.
(chattering in the distance)
- Tomorrow, the girls will collect wood
while the boys cook.
(children): No!
- That's how it goes.
Any remarks on the day?
How was the horse-riding?
- It makes your ass sore!
- Very smart, Youssef.
Anything else?
- Yes.
The leaders should
stick to girls their age.
- I don't follow you, Steve.
- Everyone else does.
- There's stewed apples for dessert.
Come and get it, but calmly,
one at a time. Here we go.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome. Sorry, I spilled some.
- Got a problem?
- Yeah, you're my problem.
- Let's talk.
- Let go of me, I don't want to talk!
Fucking let go of me!
Shit, you're fucking hurting me!
- Got any for me?
- Sure, baby,
it's over there.
- Thanks. I adore you.
- Not in front of the kids!
- Why not? They all know.
- All the same...
- It's evening now.
- It isn't.
- What?
- Cut it out.
- C'mon.
- Cut it out!
- What's wrong?
- Shit, just cut it out, will you?
- Fuck, I thought you meant Camille.
That's why-- -
Her name's Celine.
The riding teacher.
Want her lD card? Her date of birth?
- What a fucking jerk.
I screwed up.
I stand no chance. She doesn't rate me.
Ah... What a jerk. Fuck, what a jerk!
- Think before you speak. It helps.
Go back now.
- Fuck, I can't.
- And stop saying "fuck."
- He has to stop.
- You told him?
- Charlotte's mother's on the phone.
She wants the prescription.
- Tell her Charlotte's better,
that I'll fax it soon,
that we don't have
her case. improvise...
- She can go fuck herself?
- Go fuck herself?
- No, nothing. Hello?
Oh when the saints Oh when the saints
Go marching in Go marching in
Oh when the saints go marching in
I want to be in that number
Oh when the saints go marching in
Oh when the sun begins to shine
Oh when the sun
Begins to shine (music stops)
- Don't know it?
- I do.
- Anyone else?
- It sucks.
It's shit.
- Daniel, old chap,
try Mousetrap's "Ma liberate" in C.
- In C?
- Clam up!
What a shithead.
- Youssef, watch your mouth!
- Eh, d'you know anything more modern?
Singers who are still alive, say.
- Baby, Mousetrap's alive and well.
(complaining)
- You can't play guitar!
- You're crap!
(complaining)
- Enough! Enough!
- Can I borrow your guitar?
- Go ahead.
- I don't know...
- Go ahead!
(bluegrass chords)
(rhythm change)
Down around the corner
Half a mile from here
You can see them long trains run
And watch them disappear
Without love
Where would you be now
(cheering)
Without love
Love (cheering)
You know I saw Miss Lucy
Down along the tracks
She lost her home and her family
And she won't be comin, back
Without love
Where would you be right now
Without love
Love
- Daniel, don't get so upset about it!
- He's been playing for 12 years.
- Me too.
- What are you doing?
It's hot out there.
- She must think I'm a fucking jerk.
- You can't stay here all night.
- They're just tunes to show off with,
flash numbers, nothing but showy stuff.
- Do me a favour? I feel too dumb.
- What?
- I don't know... Tell Camille
that she's nice, that I like her.
Tell her I want to go out with her.
Do it for me, please, ask her.
- Fuck, you're a pain.
- Vincent.
- Yeah?
- Charlotte wants a goodnight kiss.
- I'll drop by later.
- Everyone's sleeping.
It's quieter without the older ones.
- Okay, no meeting tonight.
- Great.
- Two stay here. I'll
treat the third to a pizza.
- Cool!
- I'd like that.
- You're beat.
- Yes, I am tired.
- Bummer.
- Good night.
- Good night, Caro.
Okay, Lisa,
shall we
go? - Mm-hmm.
- So!
What do we do? Draw for it?
- Yeah, okay.
- Cool!
The camp must come to Quebec next year.
Gaspe, say. You know it?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- No, I don't know it.
- Ah.
Gaspe is the best for summer camps.
- Really?
- It has it all.
The sea, forests, mountains...
Perce Rock, Bonaventure,
Forillon National Park...
- Ah...
- Forillon Park is out of this world.
- Everything okay?
- Excellent.
- Great. No dessert, right?
- No. Just another pizza.
The same.
- Coming up.
- Thanks.
Gaspe is just perfect...
- What did you want to tell me?
- Uh...
- Has Steve calmed down?
- Yeah, he's okay now.
I wanted to see you alone.
Since we got here, the two of us get on.
I have good laughs with you.
- You seem weird.
- I bet.
You know, I'm not good at this.
- You can do it.
- Maybe, but it's tough.
Uh...
- Yes?
- Okay... I like you.
Be my girl?
- What can I say? I'll think it over.
- Good night, then.
- Good night.
(laughing)
- Yeah, '93' LA versus Montreal.
Bellows Damphousse scored this goal!
The guy's mad!
I asked him why he did it.
Why the hell did he do it?
I told him to come over to my place
to chew the fat. (rattling on)
- I don't understand.
(laughing)
- Shall we go?
- Wait a minute.
- Already up, Timothy?
- I always exercise after sex.
Have you heard, Vincent?
Léa might move to Antwerp with me.
Come and visit.
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay?
- And you?
- Fine. It went okay last night?
- Yeah, great.
I'll get the fire going.
- Do your teeth first.
- Okay.
- I'll wake them.
- Okay.
- A good brushing.
Rise and shine in there.
Life's treating you well.
- Yeah, great, but...
if only it didn't have to end one day.
Death's a really sick
thing. (girls): Shhh!
- Okay, get washed.
Breakfast in 10 minutes.
- It's not tea.
- The night must have been hot.
- Yeah, pretty hot.
Celine, the riding instructor.
I rode her all night.
Hot as a chip-fryer.
- Very classy.
Classy, no denying it.
(music)
Think I will sail on home
Ain't gonna wait for so long
- How's the camping trip going?
- Not bad. A few scoops.
- No kidding?
Who? The kids? Group leaders?
- Both.
- C'mon, tell me.
- I'm no rat.
- Vincent...
- Daniel and the riding chick.
- Ah.
- Trouble.
- What's up?
- There's someone to see you.
It could be one of the parents.
- Shit! Won't they ever respect us?
- The faggots!
Want me to handle it?
- It's okay.
- Hi!
- Dad?
- Two days without news.
- Why are you here?
- I was worried.
You never called back.
Take the bed. I'll use the floor.
You could have told me.
- You'd have said not to come.
I just need some rest.
I'm a bit low lately.
- This isn't a great place to rest.
I'll show you the TV room.
- Do your job. Don't worry about me.
I'll be discreet.
- Don't say you're my dad.
I'm the director, see.
- Don't worry.
- See you later.
- Who are you?
- I'm Albert, Vincent's father.
- His father?
- Mm-hmm.
- Hear that? He's the chief's dad.
(together): Yeah.
- He's got the same mug.
(singing)
- One little drop left...
- Okay, Vincent?
- Yeah.
Okay?
- Tough!
- Great! You enjoyed it?
- It was wicked.
- That's cool. Okay, you lovebirds?
Dinner's at seven. Don't forget, okay.
- I'm sorry.
- You could knock.
- Really!
- This is the kitchen?
I'm out of dishcloths.
- They're in the laundry room.
Okay, I'll get them for you.
Sorry.
- You need...?
- It's okay.
They're getting on my
nerves. I'll take this.
Don't stay indoors,
girls. It's sunny outside.
- You'll be all right now.
Ah, Vincent!
I've thought up a game for the kids.
- Albert, come on!
- Start picking sides.
- Okay!
- Dad, we need to talk.
You said you'd be discreet.
- I know, but I spoke to the kids
and we're going to have Olympic games.
Each group will be a continent...
- That's great.
But we have a programme to follow here.
(cheering)
- Come on, there's room.
- Start serving
- Quiet!
(chattering)
- I don't get it.
She said nothing?
- She's thinking. Give her time.
Stop asking me, okay.
- Why's she taking so long?
- That's women for you.
- Vincent?
Vincent, wake up.
- What's wrong?
- Two people for you.
- What time is it?
- They say they're young
and do sports. They look mean.
- Youth and Sports?
- That's it.
- Fuck!
- Who?
(knocking)
- Get up! Wake everybody!
I want this place spotless.
- What's up?
- Do as I say!
Morning. -
Having a lie-in?
Monique Vanier, Youth and Sports.
Gilbert Michaud, health inspector.
- How do you do.
Fancy a coffee?
- No, we'd like to start.
- They're uptight...
- It's okay, Mimoun.
- Here's the schedule.
We start in the kitchen.
We check fridge
and freezer thermometers,
inspect a recent meal sample,
verify meat-packaging
labels. - Yes.
- We need the daily
menus and all your orders.
- All that?
- Move it!
Clothes in cupboards, cases under beds!
I don't want anything lying around!
- Come on, girls, hurry it up!
Léa, grab a broom and sweep!
Open up the throttle!
I see shoes here, panties there,
a book over there!
Come on, stir yourselves!
I don't want anything lying around!
And pull your bloody fingers out!
- We'll need your safety register,
extinguisher guarantees
and the leaders' diplomas.
Then we do the rooms and bathrooms.
And, finally, your educational project.
- I think I need a coffee.
- I'm onto it.
- Ah!!!
- What is it?
- Disgusting!
- He certainly can't see that.
Thanks, Mimoun.
- What do we do? (sighing)
- ls that emergency exit clear?
- Yes.
- Still no coffee?
- Coffee in her panties...
- The meal sample now.
- You want a sample from me?
(laughing)
- The meal sample, please.
- The meal sample.
- Right, the meal sample...
Where's it hiding now?
- Okay...
- You know you have to keep a sample
of all food given to the
children for 72 hours at least?
- Yes, to avoid any
risk of food poisoning.
- Here it is.
- A sample to bear witness.
- We had an Oriental
-theme evening.
It's a way of teaching
them about the world.
An evening on a region or country.
Our Oriental evening...
- Do you know Moroccan cuisine?
- It's still good, try it.
- No, really, it's too early.
- Thanks, but no.
- I can throw you both out.
(laughing)
- He's kidding.
What a joker.
You were kidding, right?
- Yeah.
- Tell them.
- Yes, I'm kidding. (laughter)
- Try it.
- Don't insist.
- No, thank you, Mr Mimoun.
It's 9 AM. I can't take anymore.
- Vincent, get the pastries.
(Arabic music on the radio)
- Oh!
- Here you go.
- Make some room.
- Oh, no...
- You have to sample it.
It's delicious.
Dip in, make me a happy man.
- No. It is delicious,
but we need to move on to the rooms.
- Eat, it's all for you.
- No, this is serious.
- It's free. Make the most of it.
- If you please...
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.
- Hello, Daniel.
- Hello, Youssef.
- Very well-behaved...
- They're great.
After you.
- It's being repainted. (door opening)
- Sorry, we wanted to use the showers.
Are we in the way?
We can come back later if you want.
- Let's leave them...
- We'll come back?
- Of course.
- All the diplomas are in order.
But I don't see your
health agent's certificate.
- Really?
That's odd, it should be in there too.
- Who's your health agent?
- I'm sorry?
- Who's your health agent?
- Our health agent?
Well, that's... (door opening)
It's him.
- It's me.
It's me. Sorry,
I needed things from the pharmacy.
I'm the health agent.
I'm Dr Pichavent.
- The child psychiatrist?
- Yes.
I'm working with the camp this summer.
You need my diplomas?
- No need.
We have all your books.
The last one, "Cut the Cord",
is our bedtime reading.
- It's not the last one.
I've written others
since. - Pierre-Manu...
- Yes?
- Don't forget you have to...
- Yes, excuse me.
We'll talk again later.
- Incredible!
(cheering)
(whistling)
- Quiet! Quiet!
Go ahead, Guillaume.
- I declare
the 21st Olympic Games
of the Happy Days Summer Camp open.
I don't know...
- That'll do!
(cheering)
(music)
Down around the corner
Half a mile from here
You can see them long trains run
And you watch them disappear
Without love
Where would you be now
Without love
Love
You know I saw Miss Lucy
Down along the tracks
She lost her home and her family
And she won't be comin' back
Without love
Where would you be right now
Without love
Love
Well in the Illinois central
And the southern central freight
- Vincent?
- Yeah?
- Can I ask you something?
- Yes.
- Who did the teams?
- I did. Why?
- I keep losing!
- So? It's no big deal.
- Maybe for you it isn't,
but I only have juniors.
The oldest one is seven.
How can I win with them?
It's useless, I keep losing.
I feel bad and so do the kids!
And you don't care!
- Joseph...
- Count on good old Joseph!
Always happy with the juniors!
(cheering)
- Shit! We need some fucking defence!
I've been saying so for an hour now!
For an hour!
Stephanie, come here!
You're playing alone! Get out of here!
Fucking move!
We're a team!
(cheering)
Without love
Well the pistons keep on chuchin'
And the wheels go round and round.
- What's the score?
- Belgium? You only have two points.
- You're last.
(complaining)
- Just a second!
What's left?
- You still have the
wrestling with Daniel to do.
- A tough one.
- Time for your pills.
- Wait, Nadine, there's no rush.
- You're sure?
- Yeah. Right?
(music)
- Argh!
- Stop, there's a problem.
- It's okay!
Note that point.
- Truman, come here!
(screaming)
- His pills, Nadine!
You're supposed to see to them.
(screaming)
- Shit, Vincent, I told you!
- Noted that point?
- I'm not deaf, I noted it.
- That's too much. Léa,
get to your room now.
- We're just saying good night.
- Downstairs in five!
- Okay.
- Vincent?
You're lost with Lisa.
- What's that to you?
- Everyone knows.
There are even bets out.
For now, you're at 70 to 1 to lose.
It wasn't thefts.
- What do you mean?
- No one stole.
Some kids just lost bets.
I bet you'd succeed.
Want my advice?
- Okay...
- You think too much.
You try an approach,
you warm up, but you're
not in the running.
It's pissing us off.
- You're giving me advice now?
Get to bed, snot-nose.
- Eh, if you panic,
pretend to kiss her cheek
then turn at the last second.
It works every time.
- Get to bed!
- Don't let me down.
(knocking)
(teasing): Whoo!
- Steve, what are you doing?
Steve, come here! Steve!
- Youssef, come here!
- Steve, come here! (panting)
What's going on? (panting)
- No idea, I can't catch them.
- I'm beat.
- They're crafty devils.
- Ooh...
So...
What shall we do?
- What do you suggest?
- Lisa...
if I kiss you now,
I'll never let you go.
- Maybe that's not a good idea.
- Okay...
- It's not what you think.
My life in Paris is pretty complicated.
- Yes, of course. I understand.
It's best to stop there.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Say goodnight.
- Hey, Van Damme, you owe me 20!
- What can I do with this?
I only have Belgian francs.
- Hand it over.
- Come on, cough up.
- Who'd have believed it?
- It runs in the family, pal.
- Daniel, you've been
shafted up to the hilt.
You owe me 200.
- Very classy. English
public school style?
C'mon, Caro. We can work it out...
- Right?
- Hmm?
- Fine.
- Thanks, son, that really did me good.
Children and love,
I only see them on TV now.
Lisa's cute, isn't she?
She has a nice little ass.
- That's true.
Your case.
- Ah.
I made 100 francs at 40 to 1.
- Call me, okay?
- Sorry, I was just looking.
- That's okay, Caroline, I don't mind.
Help yourself from the wardrobe too.
- No, thanks, I'll manage.
- See you later, then.
(music)
What am I to do Can I let it show
Do I kept it to myself
Or should I let her know
I'm in love
Do I nurse it in my heart
Hold it back in my eyes
Hide it all inside Or put on a disguise
- Finished?
- Stop moving, I'll smear it.
- Let's go, we'll be late.
- Just a second. Do you like it?
- It's okay... Actually, it's not bad.
Let the secret out Even suffer the doubt
I'm in love
- Nadine, where are...? Caroline?
I know it's all there
I really wanna to share
my life with someone else
Will she?
Excuse me! (cheering)
Excuse me,
we have a very important announcement.
Tomorrow is the day of departure.
(booing)
Yes, in 24 hours,
the camp will be over. (booing)
It will be tough for you,
but we're happy because
we won't see you again.
(booing) And that's fantastic!
In 24 hours, you'll be home, alone...
(booing)
School starts soon! (together): No!
- Parents... (together): No!
- Teachers...
(together): No!
- In a word, stress.
So do you want some advice?
(together): Yes!
- I didn't hear that. Did you?
So do you want some advice?
(together): Yes!!!
- It's the last evening,
so make the most of it!
(screaming)
Who was who was
(disco music)
Fancy me
Thought I had my degree
In life
And how love
Ought to be a run
I had a one-step plan to prove it
Guide in my pockets for fools
Folly and fun
(cheering)
Love had to show me one thing
I was so right so right
Yeah
Thought I could turn emotion
On and off
I was so sure
But love
Showed me
Who was the boss
(cheering)
I'd defy
Anyone who claimed that I
Didn't control
Whatever moved my soul
I could attempt
Touch delight
Just because you fell for me
Why should I feel uptight
Love had to show me one thing
I was so right so right
Thought I could turn emotion
On and off
And I was so sure
But love oh love
Taught me
Who was the boss
- Well?
- Well what?
- It's kind of new for you, right?
- Yes, it's
new... - Mm-hmm.
So did you like it?
- Sort of.
- Sort of how?
All my life call me crazy
I'm drunk but I'm
sober I'm hung over too
With a box full of
candy sent here from you
You're so full of surprises
What do I do
Call me crazy
'Cause I'm falling for you
I'm feeling free I found a new friend
And finally you found me
I'm drunk in your love And satisfied
Just like chocolate and wine
- Lisa, if you were
13 during this camp,
would you have gone out with me?
I don't know...
- I don't think so.
- Thanks, you're honest.
You won't dance either?
- No.
- Okay, fine.
- I'm kidding, stupid!
- Sort of good? Sort of great?
Sort of how?
Huh?
- We fucked, it was fun, but
we don't have to analyse it.
It had to happen and I think it has.
I'll go back in. I need...
I need to dance.
- Okay...
- Ah...
Ah...
- Sorry, but "sort of"
doesn't mean a thing.
Sort of... It doesn't mean a thing.
Never heard that before.

- I don't want to go, Truman.
- See you.
How about you?
Happy to be leaving?
Go.
Go with Joseph.
- We'll do a mafe at
Joseph's on Saturday.
Coming?
- A mafe? Yeah...
- I'm counting on you, pal.
- Okay?
I'll be there. Thanks.
- Ciao.
- Vincent?
- Yeah?
See you for skiing camp.
- Maybe not.
I'm turning over a new
leaf. I'm going to study.
- You are?
- Just kidding. You can count on me.
See you this winter. Ciao.
- Ciao.
- Bye, Vincent!
- Bye, Caroline. Uh...
A goodbye kiss...
UH!
Ouch...
- Thanks for everything.
- You're welcome.
- I'll never forget you. Thank you.
- Truman...
Truman...
- Caro? Are you okay?
Vincent, I guess this is goodbye.
You can come to Quebec anytime.
- Okay.
- See you, buddy.
- Ciao, Thanks for your help.
What about you?
- I'm off to Paris.
- I know that.
(sighing)
We must look pretty stupid.
- My life's pretty complicated...
- Don't say it.
If you feel that we have something,
my train arrives tomorrow at 6:15 PM.
- Can I kiss you?
- Of course you can.
- Cough up, Achille!
- Shit!
- Thanks.
(yelling goodbye)
Eat well!
- Goodbye!
- Bye!
- Drive safely!
(soft piano music)
(hearing the children's voices)
(PA announcement)
- Did you have a good journey?
Isn't Lisa with you?
- I told you not to come and meet me.
That was my last summer with Dad,
the best one ever.
But, of course, I only
realized that later.
I stopped summer camps 15 years ago.
But I still think about them every day.
Especially today!
(chattering)
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- This is my daughter,
Juliette Rousseau.
- Hi, Juliette!
- She's a bit delicate right now.
- We're used to all that, don't worry.
- I know, I was a group leader myself.
- Bruno?
- Okay... Just a minute!
- I was a director, in fact.
I know all about it.
- Okay, great.
- Her bag.
- Great.
- Bruno, come over here, please.
- Jessica, look after Juliette.
- Be careful, okay.
The mobile's in the bag. Call me.
But hide when you call,
because it's not allowed.
- All right.
- Go on. Take care.
It was weird leaving
her there with strangers.
But without that camp 15 years ago,
I'd never have met the woman I married.
- Where the hell were
you?! You fucking pain!
Shit, you get on my tits!
- Hold on, you were late.
- Late?
Fuck, that's rich! The
car was almost towed!
- Calm down, honey.
Where are the car keys?
- Up your ass!
- Oh! Got them, it's okay.
Ah...
- Frigging seatbelt!
- D'you have to be so vulgar?
- Vulgar, me? Who gives a shit?
Give me a kiss.
- What did Juliette say?
To Yaniv, Jacques, Yanick,
and all the others...
Fancy me
