AUTUMN SPRING
Very shabby.
This
way, Maestro.
- Where do we start?
- Upstairs, sir.
- But it's leaking there.
- I'll explain. This way, please.
Good morning.
Mr. Mayer,
the property manager.
Maestro Hana, emeritus member
of the Metropolitan Opera.
His secretary,
Mr. Eduard.
We hope you're going
to like it here, Maestro!
- What is this?
- The dining room.
Only the table remains
of the set. Chippendale.
Well.
We shall see.
The property includes
and a hunting lodge.
There's time to see it,
sir,
then we'll have brunch
at the French Restaurant.
Eduard...
you say sixty million?
- Sixty-five, sir.
Let's take a look
at the hunting lodge.
We're making good time.
Excuse me,
when can we expect
your answer, Maestro?
I'm off to the States tomorrow
to consult with my lawyer.
Should the Countess
drop the price
call me immediately.
You'll have your answer
within two weeks anyway.

Shall we go and have a drink?
Iforgot.
lhave to go home.
You were great today, Fanda.
Magnificent!
Next time
we'll reverse roles.
No way!
It's in your blood.
The way you tasted
and sent back the wine!
That was a masterpiece
of acting, Fanda!
Igot carried away.
Inearly believed it myself!
- Old men should be rich.
- And respected.
I'm off.
We haven't gatecrashed our way
into a wedding for ages!
mine! Gimme that!
- Quietly, girls!
- Sit down.
- I'll have to go, Mom.
- No, wait a bit longer.
- I's been two hours.
Imust get back to work.
He promised to come.
Something held him up.
at the drunk tank.
He celebrated with friends
from the theater...
He treated the whole pub,
spent his whole pension
and you couldn't
pay the rent.
- Be quiet!
- Don't shout at them.
It's not the money, Mom.
I'll gladly help out.
Iworry about Dad.
his actions
just aren't normal, at his age!
His age has him down.
He's afraid to die,
and tries to cheat it.
Is Grandpa going to die?
We're all going to die.
Some sooner, some later.
Grandpa sooner,
right, Dad?
Wipe your mouth and be quiet!
Mother...
have you talked it over?
lhaven't found
the right opportunity.
I'm really worried.
Yesterday's scene...
- Mom hit Auntie with a ladle.
- On the head!
And our Mom
broke all the plates.
Girls, Grandpa
will love the pictures
you drew for him,
but we must go.
Grandpa looked forward
so much to seeing you.
His memory isn't
what it used to be.
Let's go.
Hurry up... your jackets.
Stick it out a bit longer, Jara.
I'll talk to him.
Good evening.
Hello, I took your elevator,
didn't I?
No.
I suffer from claustrophobia
Hello!
Are you trying to kill me?
You silly ass!
Don't say a word,
get out of my sight!
Or I'll pack up your things and
send you off to Ed's!
Five people waiting
for you for three hours
to wish you a happy birthday
and you go off on a binge!
Can a couple of measly flowers
set that straight?
No,
I know they can't.
So why spend money on them
if you know that?
- Because you love gerberas.
- No, I don't.
- You do.
- I don't.
- Yes, you do.
- I don't! So there!
All right,
so you don't.
Here are your presents
from the girls and me.
That's a pretty picture.
Karolina
is she by Jara's first
or second wife?
Pull yourself together,
you're nearly eighty,
afamily man with two
daughters-in-law
and four lovely grandchildren,
stop playing the fool and start
taking life seriously.
Sorry... but this
is quite witty!
This could be your lastbirthday,
and we didn't celebrate it.
I'd be really sorry.
Believe me.
Ido believe you.
What's this?
- Black shoes.
- For my burial?
Hardly for dancing lessons!
Though one never knows
with you. Here's your cake.
It cost 150 crowns
and the shoes 1200
Did you say anything?
I thought the shoes
were from Jara.
No, he had a present
for both of us.
It happens to be my
birthday too, you know.
I bet it's something original.
It's a gift
worth 28 000 crowns.
Not an Arctic seaside holiday,
Oh come on!
Look, what a beautiful
death announcement!
One loving heart from
this world has been taken.
Not even our love can
this heart reawaken.
I must write that down.
Give me a pencil.
I'll wait here for you
and memorize it.
No,
come with me.
Well? How d'you like
this grave?
What do the Va ouses
have to do with us?
Nothing.
The family died out,
and Jara bought
the grave for us.
So that's the gift
for 28 000 crowns?
It's a bargain at that price.
Jara has a friend
who's an undertaker.
Are you going to lie in
there with the Va ouses?
- We'll both be there, Fanda.
- Not me.
If Jara's used to buying
second-hand graves
that's his business.
I refuse to lie there
with some Va ous woman.
You won't know where
we've put you.
But I know now!
And I don't like it here.
Such a measly little cemetery,
all swarming with graves,
and no view at all.
I can't even enjoy
my smoke here.
Fanda!
Come back!
Death will still
catch up with you!
Hey...
I don't believe it!
What are you doing here?
Sorry, I really can't
quite place you...
- Come on, try!
- Josef Novak?
No! Forgotten
your best friend?
My best friend...
Venda Bayer?
Yes, Venda Bayer!
What a memory!
I'm sorry I didn't
recognize you...
But I thought you were
taller than me.
Yes,
but I had an accident.
Coming down Mont Everest
I fell 60 yards
both my legs were
fractured in three places,
Professor Cech had to
shorten my bones by 55 inches.
I never heard.
But I went on, Mont Blanc
and all, and you?
- How's the love of your life?
- You mean Milena?
Yes, what a beauty!
How we all envied you.
I'll tell you.
I married her.
Fifty years ago.
A month ago I buried her.
I'm so sorry.
She was a cutie.
And how are you doing?
Badly, on the way back
from the crematorium
I crashed my car.
It wasn't insured
so it cost me 355 000!
The funeral cost 255 000.
Now I can't even buy
her a decent wreath.
Here's 200. Get her some
flowers, give her my best
and say Venda Bayer
thinks of her often.
I'll tell her, Venda,
thank you.
Hey, what's this?
No tears!
Look to the summit!
As we mountaineers say,
where there's a will
there's a way.
So keep that chin up!
Karel!
Come here!
- I wanted it 7 inches and it's 8!
- I'll redo it. - And pronto!
- Boss, a call for you!
- I'm busy. - It's Erna.
What is it now,
dammit?
- Call Janousek.
- What should I tell him?
To come at nine.
Okay, I'm going.
Out of my bathroom!
Get the fuck out or I'll
throw all your things out!
For God's sake...
Erna,
don't do it!
- Shit! Stop it, Erna!
- There, you pig!
Don't! Stop it!
For fuck's sake! Erna!
Stop it, girls!
Damn you Erna, stop it.
- Jara, it was so awful!
- Stop it, Erna!
- Jara!
- All right, all right.
Quiet, kids.
It'll be all right.
Ticket control.
- Oh, could you overlook it?
- We forgot.
We're from out of town,
mister ticket.
It'll be a 200 crown
fine each, young ladies.
Can't you just forget it?
- Sorry, rules are rules.
- Let them go, boss.
They'll give us
a nice kiss each.
Quickly, then.
So nobody sees us.
Funeral...
Where's the drugstore?
That goes in here...
I lent you 500.
You promised it back today.
Come on!
That was funeral money.
Stop playing the fool
with your French.
You won't learn it now
that you're eighty.
I'm 76,
if you're interested.
No. I'm interested
in where that 500 is.
- 200 for People in Need.
- And the 300?
Lunch at a French restaurant
where I chose everything
from the French menu.
Eating up our funeral money
when the 30 000 we have
isn't enough for two funerals?!
You'll just kick the
bucket without a worry
and I'll have to save up
before I can die.
- All right, so I'll wait.
- That'd be a fiasco.
You'd spend the money
and toss me in some field.
So do you want me to die
first or you?
Tell me!
I don't care.
But you should care.
What if you had a stroke?
- What would I do with you?
- Put me in hospital.
After a while they'd stick you
into a rest home,
where they'd stuff
you into a cage.
But don't worry. I have
a solution. Listen.
We'll go
to a senior citizen's home.
But we must go now.
They only take fit people.
But if you get a stroke there,
they look after you.
You're going to like it there,
Fanda.
I told the manager
you sang in operetta.
She'll give you a room
with a view into the woods,
a lovely room.
We'll take our furniture.
Jara will pay for the move.
- Oh. Jara.
- He arranged it all.
He wants us in a home so
he can have this place.
You know how they're living.
Erna wants Kveta out.
Where will she take the girls?
Here,
like last time.
After Jara's first divorce
we left him and Kveta our lovely
big apartment in town
and moved out to
this rabbit-warren here.
Now he's with his 3rd wife.
The 2nd wife's in the way
so he found us a lovely room
with a view into despair.
- Tell Jara...
- Wait, let me explain.
Tell Jara...
Even if he gets married
and divorced ten more times
I'm staying here.
Nobody gets me
out of here alive!
- Do you want to go in?
- Yes. Thank you.
Good morning,
Maestro.
Good morning.
Are you about to purchase
another mansion?
Hello, boys.
I am staying with
my brother at the moment.
Come in.
- Do come in.
- Thank you.
Didn't you like it
at the Hilton?
Yes, but my brother
insisted I stay here.
We haven't seen each
other for three years.
- Oh really?
- Do take a seat.
I've added it all up,
Mr. Hana.
Here it is...
The hired limo,
the brunch,
add in wasted time,
plus 50 percent
for the intent to mislead me
into turning other clients down.
The total comes to
a 29 100 crowns. Right?
Would you like it in cash
or onto your account?
In cash.
Within a week.
How about some coffee,
tea or maybe a cognac...
Where does my brother
keep the cognac?
No thanks.
You surprise me.
I thought I'd have
to take you to court.
An emeritus member of
the Metropolitan Opera
knows the value
of success and failure.
You were good, Mr. Hana.
Convincing.
If you hadn't mixed up
your visiting cards,
I'd have believed
you'd buy the mansion.
Maybe next time.
I've called everybody I know.
No one will lend me anything.
Things used to be different.
The times have changed,
but we haven't.
Here's 10 000. I'll give
you 3 more on the 155th.
Too late, I must
pay up by Saturday.
Let's try the casino.
- Let's break the bank!
- I don't know...
- I'm not going in, Fanda.
- What are you scared of?
Haven't we played
aristocrats and rich men?
- In Die Fledermans.
- Only in the chorus.
So now you're a soloist,
button up and come on in!
We'll show the nouveau
riche lumpenbourgeoisie.
Don't go in! I'll get you
the 20 000 somehow.
Stop it.
Good afternoon.
Where do we start?
Here or here?
You used the service entrance
instead of going through
the reception desk!
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- We're from television.
We want to shoot 3 scenes for
a co-production film.
He's clean.
We need to settle
the conditions.
Speak to
our marketing manager.
Maybe we'll come
for a game some day too.
It was a pleasure,
gentlemen!
What a show-down!
The shame of it!
You were no help at all.
I'm sorry.
I'll get you the money.
Good afternoon.
- Let me help you with that.
- I can manage.
- It would be my pleasure.
- All right then.
Thank you,
it's kind of you.
- Been traveling again?
- I've been to Ostrava
with my husband.
They played against Banik.
So your husband is
a soccer player?
Yes,
for the Sparta club.
And you go with him?
I have to.
He's terribly jealous.
That's understandable.
- I'll take them up for you.
- That'd be nice of you.
It's the fifth floor,
the door on the left.
- How about coming along?
- No. Thank you.
- Thank you very much, Mr...
- Hana.
I can't use you
like this, Mr. Hana.
You may. Anything.
Madame.
Thank you,
I'll be seeing you.
- Is that her?
- Yeah.
Will she lend us some money?
Buy a big bouquet to set
the mood. Then leave it to me.
Good morning.
- Hello, uncle Ed!
- I've brought a customer.
He needs a special
bunch of flowers.
For you, Uncle,
they'll be very special.
Hello.
What kind?
What sort of price?
Up to about 1000 crowns.
For what occasion?
Who are they for?
For the French
ambassador's wife.
In that case lilies
would be splendid.
- How's Venda doing?
- As usual.
Her husband is an alcoholic.
Or orchids?
Or roses?
I've got lots.
I'll leave it up to you,
Marcela.
How long is it since your Mom...
Just yesterday I wanted to
buy flowers for her grave.
That's nice of you.
And someone stole my wallet!
With my month's
pension in it!
I went all hot and cold.
- I burst into tears.
- Tell her why!
Why?
All my money
for the month...
Tell her,
don't be shy.
Yes...
all of it...
He'll lose the chance
for a wonderful role.
What role?
He's been chosen for a film
about a concentration camp.
To play an old mime who
saves 80 Jewish children.
Seriously?
If he learns tap-dancing
within two months.
That's easy.
You'll be
in a movie, uncle Ed?
- Wonderful!
- But he wants to refuse since
the American dance teacher
wants 50 dollars a lesson.
Fifty dollars?
That much?
And how many lessons.
....
Ten.
That's 20 000 Czech crowns,
but he gets 10 000 dollars
for the part!
Ten thousand?
That's nearly
half a million!
Half a million?
I'm sorry, uncle Ed.
I can't lend you the money.
Venda's drinking,
the tax man, school fees.
950 crowns!
- Pay up!
- You have the money.
Here you go.
- Keep the change.
- Bye, and thank you!
What do I do with the flowers?
Put them
on your sister's grave.
I heard that Mary Grulich
had her 855th birthday.
- How about...
- So let's catch a taxi!
- 'Bye for now, and take care.
- Good morning.
I just brought
Mary her shopping.
She's in a bad way,
her legs, poor thing,
that tiny pension and
she forgets everything.
She owes me 2000 but
I'm not saying anything.
She'll be pleased
to see you, gentlemen.
- No way!
- Oh yes!
We come with our congratulations
on behalf of the theatre.
They all send their regards.
They remembered!
You were the pride of
the theatre for 40 years!
The oldest chorus-girl
in history.
And a soloist, boys,
but you wouldn't remember.
In '41 I sang Helena in
Polish Blood as stand-in.
The lead tenor gave me
these flowers afterwards
and this bottle
of old Spanish wine.
How we loved Polish Blood!
We all wanted to sing
Count Baransky.
I know since
you're a cavalier...
I am not right for you,
dear...
I'm just a maid,
after all...
It's over
and done with now.
You've made me so happy,
boys.
I slept right through
my horrible birthday.
But now we'll celebrate!
I saved it for 60 years
for the right occasion.
Open it!
Vintage 1930!
- Here's a cork-screw.
- What an honor for us.
You were always
the princess of our dreams.
This wine's so good it doesn't
want to come out!
How much is there left?
The flowers,
taxi... 6000 of your money.
I left 2000
under Mary's vase.
You are so kind,
Fanda.
Good deeds
pave the way to heaven.
But is there an afterlife?
Who knows. Just in case...
so be good.
Give that boy a hundred.
- A whole hundred bill?
- For both of us.
- Isn't that too much?
- You don't want to get to heaven?
- Here you go.
- Right on.
Thank you very much.
Stop!
Stop thief!
- I feel like crying, Fanda.
- That won't help.
- Good, he didn't take my ID card.
- What will you do?
I'll have to tap into
the funeral savings.
How about
selling something?
The anatomists buy skeletons.
But they don't take baldies.
Seriously,
what will you do?
We're down to our last thousand.
So let's let off some steam.
Come on, do something!
Can't you see that I can't see?
Bring me the funeral savings book.
I'm going to the bank.
- Where is it?
- In the big dish.
It's not in the dish.
But I put it there.
Here it is.
My, you scared me.
I think you'd better...
not open it.
- Fanda!
- I took out thirty thousand.
Thirty thousand?!
D'you want to borrow
my glasses?
I'm not going to scream.
I'm going to kill you.
Well, I understand
how you feel...
- So you understand?
- Absolutely.
So why did you take
the only money we have?
I've been betting on your birth date
in the lottery for 30 years.
I expect to hit the jackpot now.
What have you done
with the money?
I was sorry that you'd
only ever been to Hungary.
I wanted to buy you
a holiday in Hurghada.
- Where?
- The Red Sea, Luxor, Karnak,
Queen Hatshepsovet's Temple.
I'm not going to any Hukarda!
You won't, because a bogus blind
man stole the money.
The Red Sea.
A bogus blind man!
D'you expect me
to believe you?
- No.
- So why make up these lies?
- Why deceive me?
- You're shouting.
Yes, let everyone hear that
my husband's a liar and thief
who ruins my health
and shortens my life.
I can't even die
decently because of him!
But I've had enough
of your silly pranks.
Kill it!
The moth!
- Put that paper back.
- I will, after I've read it.
He complained someone's
stealing his paper!
How does he know? It's
in place when he comes home.
Yes, with the crossword
puzzle done.
He can't do it himself anyway.
Don't smoke.
You'll cough.
I cough better when I smoke.
By the way,
I want that 30 000 back.
And tie your shoelace.
I'll think it over.
Till then you'll give me
all of your pension.
That might make you take
life seriously at last.
- What did you say?
- It's going to be a lovely day!
When we've done the shopping
we're going to Jara's
to look after the children.
- Josef! What a coincidence!
- Josef who?
A scene-shifter
from the theater...
See you at the yogurt counter.
It was parked here!
My new car!
I saved up for it
for five years.
I didn't notice it.
What color was it?
Yellow. Stolen with
Agapornis fisheri
- What am I going to do?
- You must report it.
Come, I'll take you
to the police station.
Those jerks are supposed
to watch this parking lot.
Let's go!
Two luxury villas.
And a magnificent
mansion for 60 million.
- But that's 200 miles away.
- It looks splendid.
But 155 rooms,
that's not really enough.
There are servants'
quarters with 10 rooms.
It would make an exclusive
bed and breakfast place!
Good idea.
Antique furniture,
oriental rugs, old paintings
and the prettiest waitresses
in period costumes.
- Or without...
- Hey, control yourself.
Beauty queens,
anyway.
36,24,
Make the arrangements
so they take us there.
I'm due for a medical check-up.
If the worst comes to the worst
would you look after my dog.
He's an old softie.
He's bitten me twice!
That's a token of love,
he bites me too when I go out.
He stands on a chair by
the window and I wave to him
so he knows I'll be back.
Old age is sad.
One should die young.
We missed our chance.
We gotta stick it out now.
Easy for you to say.
I cry when I hear
an oompah band.
I see those sad,
abandoned doggie eyes.
I'd shoot myself
if it wasn't for you.
In that case aim for
the heart to be sure.
A tip
from the court pathologist.
It's a trophy from the theatre.
What's the problem,
anyway?
Kidneys, high blood
pressure, cataracts.
You are lucky!
I've got arrhythmia,
gall-bladder, prostate -
but it's all better
than having AIDS.
You're such a lucky
fellow, Fanda.
- Help me, please!
- Come on. - No!
Don't be scared,
it's safe!
- Oh God. Do something, sing!
- Don't be frightened.
Oho,
cried Robin Hood...
I'll give you Robin Hood!
Stop!
We'll ride up and down
until he cools off.
Sing!
Stop!
Calm down.
It's perfectly safe.
- What's all this?
- Hello Dad.
Well you see Kveta...
I mean Erna...
You see if we do move
to that home.
Jara has to furnish
this room for Kveta.
I've been there.
It's a very nice place.
You could move in
within two months.
I am not moving out of here.
- We have to help them,
Fanda. - No, we don't.
like my meal now.
- Sorry.
Enjoy.
We just need to make
About what? I'm staying here, in my apartment.
Jara bought us this place.
And he brought me the 30
thousand you were robbed of.
Good, because if you
hound me out of here,
you'll be needing
that money, dear.
What...
Who's driving you out?
Where are you going?
- I don't feel well.
- What's wrong?
How could you sell me like this?
Mrs. Hanova...
Fanda...
...is dead.
He's dead.
He came here
awfully upset, sat down
and suddenly collapsed.
He didn't regain
consciousness.
I don't believe it.
Why didn't the doctor save him?
Why didn't he help him,
Mr. Stara?
She's arrived by taxi carrying
a black suit.
By taxi.
Now we're screwed.
Look,
a funeral van.
Go on ahead, Mom.
Watch your step.
I'm sorry.
He fainted.
He went dead white
and stopped breathing.
Don't cry,
everything will be all right!
You said the doctor
couldn't help him.
I thought I called
the ambulance...
So was the doctor here
or wasn't he?
No.
Ed wanted to help me.
So that you'd realize
what you'd lose in him.
And he sort of
overdid it a bit.
The taxi cost 500,
the coffin 3000!
The fright nearly
cost me my life!
You put him up to it!
You criminal!
You liar!
You heartless brute!
This way...
I can't go on.
I refuse to live with him.
- So what's with the coffin?
- Take it away.
- That'll cost you.
- We'll settle it right now.
Hello Dad,
hello Ed.
Dad!
Move in with me,
nobody'll bother you
and you can do as you like.
Emilie Hanova
and Frantisek Hana.
Applicant, please clarify your
petition for a divorce.
I made my statement in writing
and have nothing to add.
How long have you
been together?
For 44 years.
A long time. You went
through a lot together.
Good things and bad.
Is your marriage now
so seriously impaired
- That it cannot be saved?
- Yes.
Does the applicant's lawyer
have any questions?
Did your husband often
spend his whole pension
without contributing
to the household?
Do you know what
he spent the money on?
- Different things.
- Give us some examples.
I asked him to visit
his father's grave
and he returned a week
later from some spa.
He lost his month's pension
and 4000 crowns at the Casino.
But he didn't go there
to gamble,
he heard about the sightseeing
flights and
he always had longed to see
the world from a bird's-eye view.
But there was fog, he had
to wait for good weather
and he gambled the money
away out of boredom.
And he spent your savings
in expensive restaurants.
He had a poor childhood.
During the depression
his father split matches
in half to save money
and as a boy he served beers
in a gadren pub.
He wanted to see what
it's like to be rich.
Did you tolerate
his behavior?
No,
but when I was mad
he brought me flowers
and I always forgave him.
- Any more questions?
- That will be all.
As the respondent,
do you have anything to say?
It's true, the applicant
always forgave me
but I didn't appreciate it.
You may sit down.
For the records...
- Well? How's it going?
- Badly.
Witness Jaroslav Hana.
Just as an example.
Once mother persuaded him
to look after his grandchildren
for a while.
He took my two little girls to
a cafe by taxi.
To a smoky cafe...
He ordered champagne,
they all got tipsy
and he forgot them
on the subway.
But Dad's a very kind man.
He's fun and he's generous, but...
Incompetent.
Being so irresponsible,
he's just not fit for marriage.
Life with him really
is sheer martyrdom.
It's very hard for me
to have to say this.
Mother thought
he'd grow wise with age
but this last thing
was a very cruel trick
and mother realized
she couldn't stand more.
Can you describe
this cruel trick?
He put his friend
up to it... Ed...
Mr. Stara told mother that Dad had died
at his place.
- Do you wish to speak?
- Yes.
Out with it,
Mom.
It was a terrible thing
to do, devastating.
Although I admit
I went against him
when our son wanted our
flat for his ex-wife and kids.
and arranged to move
us to an old folks' home.
He refused, and for my
effort to help our son
he punished me so cruelly.
Me, who always forgave him for
all his crazy ideas.
Because I admired him
for being so different.
I'm a stick-in-the-mud
sort of person,
studying maps.
He means to fly round the world in a balloon,
and he refuses to admit
that our paths don't really lead
anywhere anymore.
It's intolerable.
The older
he gets, the crazier he is.
He doesn't go to funerals,
he makes fun of death,
he makes paper darts
out of death announcements.
I don't know if he wants
to be buried or cremated!
He doesn't know
the price of bread,
but follows
the dollar exchange rate.
When the dollar dropped he bought
me 8000 crowns worth for Xmas.
He throws money around
and saves money -
by stealing
our neighbor's newspaper.
He always returns it in time but
I'm on tenterhooks
he'll be caught at it.
When we took the train
to his dad's grave
he didn't buy any tickets.
The inspector caught us
but Fanda proudly paid
the fine and left him a tip!
The inspector burst into tears.
And when I scold him
he says I'm right
and just goes on doing it.
I've been listening carefully.
I feel that in your own way
you still love your husband
despite his shortcomings.
Let me ask you again.
Are you fully convinced
of your incompatibility?
Please tell me, with your whole heart
and conscience.
Do you insist on a divorce?
No. Even though I know
I'm going to regret it.
You heard
the applicant's decision.
Do you wish to say anything?
I want to state
that I love my wife
and that I'll mend my ways.
Thank you.
- Nice, isn't it?
- Yes. Nice.
Jara'll hew off
THE VANOUS FAMILY
and put up
THE HANA FAMILY in gold
We'll have our photos taken.
I want them on the gravestone.
- Isn't it beautiful?
- It's very nice here.
Don't smoke here, Fanda.
It's not fitting...
I don't want to
harp at you, but...
No, that's all right.
Done.
No, I'd be so glad
if you stopped smoking.
All right.
If you mind that much.
It's not because of me.
Smoking causes cancer.
...
say the health warnings.
Exactly.
Please bring up some water.
The tap's back there
by the morgue.
Right behind you.
Here we'll keep what you
save by not smoking.
Have you finished all
the crosswords again?
The storekeeper said
they're difficult.
Some are,
some aren't.
Mr. Stara,
please leave Fanda alone.
No. He does not want
to talk to you.
Why?
What a question!
He was nearly divorced
because of you!
You're going to the hospital?
Yes. I'll tell him.
Goodbye.
That was Ed. He says
he's going to the hospital.
Which one?
He didn't say.
Who knows if it's true.
He has high blood pressure and
his kidney's failing.
You should try for
a crossword puzzle prize.
The storekeeper won a book
and 1500 crowns once.
- Shall I wash the dishes?
- After dinner.
Now grind the poppy seeds
and take your vitamins.
Isn't it wonderful being together
like this,
- With you helping me.
- Yes. Wonderful.
Marie from Brod has died!
Which Marie?
My dad's step-brother's
son's wife.
I didn't know her.
Look how cheap-Iooking
the announcement is.
- I don't care.
- About anything, I know.
Luckily
it won't be up to you.
Here's everything ready
for when I die.
My death announcement,
the undertaker's phone number,
my coffin clothes,
the addresses where
to send the announcements.
The funeral music, flowers,
even your announcement.
So check it to see
if you like it.
Hello,
I'm Mr. Stara's neighbor.
- Yes?
- Can I speak to Mr. Hana?
- Come in.
- Thanks.
Come on, Bobby!
I couldn't find you,
pal.
Sure...
- Got a cigarette?
- Don't play the fool.
I thought you were paralyzed.
Only my right arm
and right leg.
Not bad here,
is it?
Fine.
That one kicked it.
That one's been moved
to a loony-bin.
He kept walking naked
into the nurses' room
demanding erotic massages.
So how are you doing?
I'm training for
the wheelchair races.
But the damn thing
keeps swerving
to the left.
You'll have to go
see the mansion on your own.
No,
I'll wait for you.
Such a beautiful mansion,
a really nice place to live.
So let's buy it.
They might give us a discount.
My savings book
is in that drawer.
Take it.
Good idea,
we'll borrow the rest.
I hope it's enough
for my funeral.
To hell with that.
I'm giving up,
Fanda.
Should we never meet again,
it's been wonderful,
it's been just enough.
Stop it,
stupid.
Listen to this,
there's a young
nurse here who...
but you must light up
for this story.
I don't smoke any more.
It's gone too fast.
I meant
to visit Dad's birthplace.
- I'll take you there.
- Take me back to bed.
Life isn't worth a light
and it won't get better.
You mustn't give up.
Your dog's waiting.
God!
I can't even
take a piss on my own!
Hello, Mr. Hana.
Will you wait outside
for me, Dad?
I wanted to say goodbye
but you were out.
I'm moving to my mother's
in Kolin.
Cologne?
Not that far.
Thanks for everything.
It's pure hell at home.
I don't sleep at all.
Don't mention it today.
- Hello Dad.
- Grandpa!
We've got visitors!
Which one are you?
Karolina?
- No, Marketa!
- We're going to move here.
Be quiet, girls!
Sorry, Dad.
The two women keep gassing
about it in front of them.
I'm not angry.
I'll have to check out the home
for senior citizens.
- You don't want to go, do you?
- Yes I do.
You look like you're
going to your execution.
the train's here.
Listen, I don't want
you forced into this.
I'd like to see it.
If we're moving there.
You said you would
never move.
The situation was
different then.
Come,
let's go home.
We missed the train anyway.
I've lost a shoe!
Here...
hold me up...
Your coffee.
Thanks.
You fell asleep again.
- No.
- Yes! It's getting worse!
You snore away all day
or sit hunched up
by the window like
that poor man downstairs.
You don't talk,
don't smoke, don't drink,
don't sing,
don't quarrel.
I can't stand it any more!
- I wanted to please you.
- Please me?
What happened to you?
I married a cheerful man
with crazy ideas,
with whom I laughed
and argued all day
and nowadays you sit here
like a living corpse,
like some dope
who doesn't care that I'm unhappy.
That I can't live like this!
And I won't!
Mr. Stara...
Forgive me for bothering
you, I need your advice.
It's about Fanda.
He's unhappy.
He's terribly unhappy,
and I don't know what to do.
- Where are you going?
- We're are going on a trip.
- Where to?
- To buy a mansion.
Go and get ready.
Wait.
It's not that simple.
It's all arranged.
Ed gave me instructions.
Who did you say you are?
The wife of an emeritus member
of the New York Met
who is returning
to his native country.
Is the agent going too?
The owner's representative
will be at the mansion.
What did Ed say?
How is he?
Poor man, he's going
into a geriatric unit.
I said we'd come and tell
him how it went.
I'll get it.
I understand.
How can you say
I'm not supportive?
But the situation has changed.
You have everything, Jara.
Money, a job, your youth -
and you have time.
We don't have any time.
Sorry,
I'm in a hurry.
No, it's you who
complicated things, dear.
You shouldn't have gone
after all those women.
That's all.
'Bye.
Hurry up!
He's not there!
He sat there dead for
Come on, then.
Look, the trees
are blooming!
I feel good.
Aren't you well?
I'm scared to death.
Don't worry, you only feel
that way the first time.
Let's hope I make it
through this.
- Turn around and drive back.
- Yes, sir.
Very shabby.
I'm not taking it.
What?
What's happening?
Nothing. The place
is too small and neglected.
I don't think
you'd like it here.
