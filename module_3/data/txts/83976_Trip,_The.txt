ROB: Hello?
Hello, Rob. Steve Coogan.
- Who's this?
- Steve Coogan.
Hey, how are you?
Great. How are you?
Good, where are you?
I'm in London, just got back
from filming in New York.
I play a chef. It's called Medium Rare.
Anyway, they want me to do publicity
for the launch of the series.
(CHILD WAILS)
They want me to do a series
of restaurant reviews.
This time, a trip to Spain.

"Monasterio de San Juan de la Pena
"is one of the most stunning
sacred buildings in Aragon,
"if not in Spain.
"A popular detour for pilgrims
"as it was thought to contain
the Holy Grail."
(COCK CROWS)
STEVE: Well, you could go and have a look,
probably won't find it.
ROB: You can't find the Holy Grail
because it doesn't exist.
We are speaking about a metaphor,
but I'd love to have a look for it.
You don't know what the Holy Grail is?
- No.
- It's the chalice that Jesus Christ
allegedly drank from
- at the Last Supper...
- At the Last Supper.
I didn't know that.
Why wouldn't I know that?
The poisoned chalice.
No, it's not the poisoned chalice,
it's just the chalice that he drank...
- Chalice Doesn't Live Here Any More.
-...the wine from.
Chalice In Wonderland.
We each have our own Holy Grail
personal to ourselves.
What would yours be?
I...
My Holy Grail is the search.
I like the fact that life is a journey
that you never...that you don't find
the thing you're looking for.
We can have a look.
Let me see how far away it is.
(ROB MURMURS)
ROB: Oh, hang on - one hour 23 minutes.
Too far.
STEVE: No, well, let's not bother.
I'm not going to go that far
to find the Holy Grail.
(AS ALAN BENNETT)
"In the small town of Prejano,
"a gastronomic treasure is hidden.
"It is La Posada del Laurel,
"a Riojan restaurant
serving traditional cuisine,
"which presents dishes prepared
with creativity and a signature touch.
"They have a wonderful wine cellar.
"La Posada del Laurel will leave you
with a great taste."
- Sounds nice, doesn't it?
- Yeah.
"'It's nice to get out,' said Mam."
ROB: This is the area
that Terry Gilliam was in
when he was trying to do Don Quixote.
Lostln La Mancha is the documentary
about his failure to do so.
It's a show I would like to do.
- Man OfLa Mancha.
- Lostln La Mancha?Oh, Man Of...?
The stage musical.
It might be my next
theatrical venture.
- Really?
- Yes.
You get to sing The Impossible Dream-
great song.
# To dream the impossible dream
# To fight the unbeatable foe
# To bear with unbearable sorrow
# To run where the brave dare not go
BOTH: # To right the unrightable wrong
# To love, pure and chaste from afar
# To try when your arms are too weary
# To reach the unreachable star
# This is my quest
# To follow that star
# No matter how hopeless
# No matter how far
# To fight for the right
# Without question or pause
# To be willing to march into hell
# For a heavenly cause
- # And I know...
- Ooh!
# If I'll only be true
# To this glorious quest
# That my heart
will lie peaceful and calm
- # When I'm laid to my rest... #
- (EXHALES)
ROB: Given that this is Rioja,
I would've thought we'd see
a lot more vines.
It's of no interest to me
these days, Rob,
because I no longer drink alcohol.
I like wine, I like Rioja.
What's with all the dinosaur signs?
I suppose there's lots of dinosaurs
who used to live around here.
I say we visit,
because Chloe loves dinosaurs.
- Who's Chloe?
- My daughter.
Oh.
- Gracias.
- Por favor, quiero agua con gas.
WAITER: Perfecto.
Oh, this is...
- Si.
- Muy bien, gracias.
That's lovely, that is.

(CONVERSATION AND LAUGHTER)
Salteado de verduras con trompetillas.
Muchas gracias.
- Salteado de verduras sin trompetillas.
- Gracias.
- What did he say, mushrooms?
- No, there's no mushrooms on yours.
- Mm. Mm.
- Mmm.
That's nice. A bit salty.
It's not as fashionably al dente
as some would be.
- No.
- I quite like that.
Sometimes... I tell you what,
this al dente fashion,
where I really resent it
is in sprouts.
I can't stand a crunchy sprout.
I want it to have a bit of give
in it, you know?
- Really?
- Yeah.
I think there's a happy medium
between the way grandmas did it...
- Which was essentially a broth.
- Yeah.
I mean, there used to be a letter
in Vizsaying,
"Mums over 50 -
don't forget the last day for putting on
"your vegetables to boil for
Christmas dinner is December 10th."
I was an adult, I was a grown man
before I felt a firm sprout
in my mouth.
- Ah.
- Oh.
Pimientos del cristal asados a la lena.
Gracias.
Muchas gracias.
Muchas, muchas gracias.
Un poquito más de vino, le pongo?
Well?
- No, thank you.
- Vale.
- What was he asking?
- If you wanted some more wine.
Mm. Mm...
A terrible year, in many ways.
If you think about the number
of people who've died.
- I mean, gifted people.
- Yeah.
David Bowie's death was like -
what did Tony Visconti say?
It was an artistic act, his death.
- Yeah, it was, it was remarkable.
- He just disappeared. No funeral.
He literally just went pfft!
Had a song called Lazarus
on his last record.
It was wonderful.
It was actually brilliant.
Yeah, it was, it was admirable.
I told you about the time
he was on the radio
and he wanted to mention me
but couldn't remember my name.
- Really?
- Mm.
He was being interviewed
and the interviewer said,
"What do you do when you're on tour,
on the bus? "
And he said he watched Cruise OfThe Gods,
that we did.
And he said, "You know the one.
(AS DAVID BOWIE) "It stars that guy."
- Really?
- And he said, "Who? " Yeah.
And I was in the kitchen
and I went, "My God!
- "He's about to mention me, David Bowie."
- Are you sure he didn't mean me?
No, no, no, because he said,
"You know, the one from Marion And Geoff.. "
- Really? He said Marion And Geoff.?
- Yes, yes.
Wow.
And I was going, "It's me, it's me."
And the interviewer
was going, "No, "I don't know,
I don't know."
So he never said my name, but he was
thinking of my face at that moment.
And when he died,
I looked at his Twitter feed
and do you know what, Steve?
He followed me on Twitter.
Really?
You don't know what to do
with that information, do you?
Well, no disrespect to you,
but he's just ever so slightly -
I mean, microscopically -
diminished in my mind.
Just think -
and I know you won't like this -
there will have been a time when
he sat there with his phone and went,
(AS BOWIE) # Shall I follow him?
# Shall I follow him?
# I think I shall
# He's funny
# Shall I follow
# Rob Brydon?
# I think I shall!
(HIGH-PITCHED)
# Shall I follow Rob Brydon?
(LOW-PITCHED) # Or shall I follow
Rob Brydon in my later years?
# And that is when it was
♪ In his later years. ♪
And he would have pressed on that button
and clicked and followed me and seen
- every tweet.
- Yeah.
Oh!
- Chuleta hierba y cordero lechal.
- Gracias.
- (WAITER SPEAKS IN SPANISH)
- Gracias.
Un poquito más de vino?
Si, gracias.
They've arranged it like
something Bear Grylls
would build in the forest.
- Some sort of pyramid.
- Yeah.
- No, a teepee.
- Mm.
- Muchas gracias.
- Lovely, really nice.
- Bueno, bueno.
- Thank you.
- Very... Is it salty?
- Mm.
- They love their salt, don't they?
- It's natural.
- Natural salt of the lamb.
- Mm.
- Terry Wogan, yeah?
- Yeah.
- That was sad.
- It was.
That was sad, cos it was sudden.
(AS WOGAN)
Here one minute, gone the next.
He was someone we thought
would always be around, wasn't he?
Because he'd been around,
all my life.
Been around forever.
And now he's gone, it's very sad.
It's kind of grotesque
that we sit talking about death.
Look outside the window,
look at that.
That'll be here when we're gone,
we should enjoy it now.
We should be...
If we had anything about us,
we'd be sitting on the top of that now,
looking down at this.
- I do.
- Agreed?
I do, I sometimes get up
at the crack of dawn...
How does she feel about it?
Thank you.
...and head up to the top
of a rugged fell...
How does she feel about it?
Didn't quite work, but never mind.
...and watch the dawn come up.
How does she feel about it?
Have you been up
the Old Man of Coniston lately?
Er, I have, a few times.
How does he feel about it?
(STEVE SNIGGERS)
Helvellyn?
- It was.
- It certainly is!
Ooh, look at this.
Souffle de caramelo a la sal
con helado de coco.
Souffle de caramelo - caramel souffle.
That's lovely, isn't it?
- It's fantastic.
- Yeah.
It's very, very good.
It's ever so nice.
Mmm!
I had a text from James yesterday,
on his way to work.
- James who?
- Driving along Sunset Boulevard.
- James who?
- James Corden.
Oh, right.
- He is on top of the world.
- Yeah.
Yeah, they offered me that gig.
(ROB CHUCKLES)
- What?
- Seriously?
No, they didn't offer it me, they enquired
as to whether I was interested.
That would not be playing
to your strengths.
- I said no.
- Very wise.
I don't think you'd be good
at hosting a talk show.
I wouldn't because I can't pretend
to be interested in people I find dull.
You sometimes struggle
with people that you like.
And I...within all... Yeah.
He's on the cover of GQ.
It says, "Mr America -
"how James Corden became
the most powerful man in television."
- Mm...most powerful man in television?
- Hyperbole.
But you don't get that kind of a headline
without some...
Yes, of course, that's true, that's true.
But, you know, I don't envy him.
- No, no, no, no, why would you?
- You know,
Iast time I looked,
he had zero Oscar nominations.
The big thing is Carpool Karaoke.
- Two guys singing in a car.
- Singing in a car.
Imagine pulling that off.
I wouldn't put a camera on it.
Que tal? Puedo...?
Gracias. Um...Ia cuenta, por favor?
- Si.
- Also, um...dinosaurs?
Donde esta...Ios dinosaurs?
Dinosaurios...
Si, todo esta es zono de dinosaurios.
- Oh!
- Les traigo un folleto.
Gracias. He says there's lots of them
in this area
and he's going to get something for us.
Sure he's not gone to get one?
It was as if he was saying,
"I've got one out the back."
Very funny if he...
- With a lead.
- He just came with a lead.
Just pulling it as if it was there,
and made some noises,
Morecambe and Wise-style.
"Get back, get back!" - like that.
And then he came in and went, "Oh, oh..."
He might, he...
Oh, no, it's a pamphlet.
Ah, gracias.
- Y esto. Aqui, todo bien.
- Muchas gracias.
Muchas gracias.
Um...
(AS HENRY KELLY) Well, it's that time
again, it's a very special edition,
coming to you live from Espana,
as they call it here.
It's time to play Guess The Bill.
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the show.
Always good to have you along.
Joining us again,
our reigning champion, Stephen Coogan.
He comes from Pedantry
in the north of England,
and the viewers really have
taken to him.
Several letters. And a lot of them
just saying, "Why? " So, Stephen,
here is the bill. Take a guess.
Bwwrrpp!
You're on live television -
don't do that.
Is the bill 1 34.30 euro,
1 34.75 euro, 1 36.40 euro?
And I will ask you to hurry, Stephen.
The second one.
You think it's the second one?
You're saying 1 36.40 euros?
Stephen...
...you got it right!
- You've won. Ladies and gentlemen...
- Yeah.
Give a wave to everybody at home,
- you conceited twat.
- Before we go,
can you tell me again
exactly where in Ireland you're from?
I'm from the county of Ireland,
as you pointed out, in Donny-cork.
You won't win any friends with
your lack of specificity on your Irish.
You really are a most objectionable
arse of a man.
People just go, "Well, where's that from? "
- It's like me saying...
- Look at this.
(SCOTTISH ACCENT) "I'm from Scotland!"
Look at this. Stephen, Stephen.
(WHISTLES)
Kirk to Enterprise.
You're like a very small member
of the Starship Enterprise.
(HIGH-PITCHED) Kirk to Enterprise.
I don't know what's happened,
I got really small.
My communicator's kind of big.
Ow!
Can you do Captain Kirk?
(AMERICAN ACCENT)
Course I can. Spock...
(AMERICAN ACCENT)
Mr Spock, coordinates, please.
That's Elvis.
It's Pierce Brosnan,
that was your Pierce Brosnan!
- It wasn't. Mr Spock...
- Your coordinates, please.
- Your coordinates, please.
Mr Spock.
- What?
- What?
Love is a strange thing.
What is that?
That's a strange voice.
- Well, do your Captain Kirk.
- OK, ready?
(WHISTLES)
Kirk to Enterprise, stardate...
You're doing Elvis. Do William Shatner.
Spock, I wonder if
you're lonesome tonight.
- Come on - do William Shatner.
- OK.
(WHISTLES)
Spock, it's Kirk.
I've landed on a planet - it's small,
full of irritating pedants.
I've managed to speak to one of them.
I'm shining my communicator
on him now.
I know.
(WHISTLES)
(CONVERSATION IN SPANISH)
I'm going to put my boots on.
- Put your boots on?
- Yeah.
- Dusty.
- We're only going there.
I love these boots.
Yeah, they're good
intermediate walking shoes, those.
But...you couldn't attach crampons
if there was any ice.
I don't plan to go on any ice.
No-one plans for ice, Rob.
You've got to be prepared...
- Hey!
-...in case it suddenly appears.
You see? They're not very good
for scree work either.
You've just got to be decisive about
where you put your feet, that's all.
Do a picture of me
with the dinosaur.
Which one's the dinosaur?
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Ha-ha!
OK. Seeing as the dinosaur's doing
a McCartney-style thumbs up,
why don't you mimic that?
(AS PAUL MCCARTNEY)
"Hey, rock and roll.
"I mean, Ringo, he was actually
a good drummer, you know? "
What's that dinosaur called?
- Barney.
- No.
- It's a T rex.
- It's actually not.
- It's an iguanodon.
- How do you know?
Throw the phone!
Because, um, Chloe is an expert.
Well, tell me this, why have they changed
the name of the brontosaurus
to a brachiosaurus?
No-one's given me
an adequate answer.
(GRUFFLY) "Brontosaurus, which would
previously roam the lands..."
- Who's that?
- It's John Hurt.
It's not John Hurt.
- Who is it?
- I don't know,
but if you're going to do John Hurt,
you have to...
(AS JOHN HURT) "The brachiosaurus
once roamed the land,
"the king of all he surveyed."
That's a very good John Hurt.
"The king of all he surveyed.
"it's a combination of him
as Quentin Crisp
"and Caligula in I, Claudius. "
- Why are you...?
- "You can go away now, Rob.
"I was thinking of killing you
but I've changed my mind."
So does Chloe know about
the different prehistoric periods?
Yep.
Not, you know... She...
Not so she could sit an exam...
Does she know Triassic, Jurassic,
Cretaceous?
She knows some of those,
she knows the words.
I'm not going to pretend
that she could give a lecture.
STEVE: Of course, in the...
...in the Triassic period,
the world was one landmass,
just with the sea,
and that was it, one body of land,
and then the Jurassic period,
it split into two big lumps of land.
And then finally the Cretaceous,
it broke up into the continents
that we know today.
Look at that -
they're the actual footprints.
STEVE: They're big, aren't they?
What size are your feet?
Seven.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Go on, then, off you go.
- It's just that is quite...
- They're too small.
- Quite feminine.
- They are feminine, I know.
- Small feet.
Nice on a woman,
bit weird on a bloke.
Indeed.
If I could change one thing
about me...
Well, it wouldn't be the feet,
but I would get to the feet quite soon.
It would be feet, height
and hair, wouldn't it?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
ROB: (AS PAUL MCCARTNEY)
The thing with Paul now is that
some of the mobility's gone
from round his mouth,
so he's got this sliding thing going on,
you know?
(AS PAUL MCCARTNEY)
But I think you're making him sound
Iike there's something wrong with him
cos when I met him, I thought he was,
you know, quite articulate.
I'm not saying he's inarticulate,
Steve,
what I'm saying is that
as he gets older -
and it'll happen to you, I hope -
he's losing some vocal mobility.
- That's all.
- I really don't talk like that.
Why don't you put a sock in it, right,
and let me...?
(AS JOHN LENNON)
Oh, Paul, just play...
Just play the guitar
the wrong way round, will you?
John, what are you doing here all these
years after your untimely death?
I thought I'd come back to say
that I wanted to bury the hatchet.
And I know where
you want to put it, John!
- In your head.
- In my head, yeah.
I said it first, right?
- Not in your head.
- # Oooh! #
Not in your head.
# Oooh! #
- Anyway...
- Yeah, go on.
- Yeah, go on.
- Go on, then.
(AS JOHN LENNON) Why don't
you go on, then? That was good.
Yeah, but, I know, I'm trying to do it
the right way, you know?
I think I'm already doing it
the right way, you know.
I think you're doing it more like that,
like...da-da-da-da-da!
(MIMICS PAUL MCCARTNEY)
When you do it, Rob, it sounds like,
you know, Woody Woodpecker.
STEVE: I think you get
a little bit confused
because you do Barry Gibb
and you get confused between the two,
because John Lennon was very much
like that, you know?
ROB: (AS BARRY GIBB)
This is Barry Gibb.
Please join me this Saturday night
on VH1, when I will be joined
by Miss Celine Dion
and Miss Barbra Streisand.
That's right, two divas
for the price of one.
GUIDE: Now, you know
this was a Moorish castle?
And when it was conquered
by the Christians,
it became the official residence
of the Sigüenza bishop.
Please.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
And during the Civil War, the town was
bombarded by the Condor legion
and the castle was hit.
- Como Guernica?
- Yeah, like Guernica.
The last resistance of the town
took place in the cathedral
and it was bombarded too,
and they surrendered
because they didn't have
any more ammunition.
- Yes, of course, wow.
- The final attack.
Over there, we have a room that was
the setting for Marlon Brando's movie,
in the early '90s.
He played the role of Friar Torquemada.
- Ah!
- He was the Grand Inquisitor.
Of course, the Spanish Inquisition.
(PYTHONESQUE) Nobody expects that.
Mi amigo gusta Monty Python.
- I love them too.
- Really?
- Wow. Good.
- Please, after you.
Yes, of course.
This is Jonathan.
- Hey, Jonathan. Steve Coogan.
- Steve!
Hey, how are you, man?
- Good, how are you?
- Yeah, I'm great.
So, listen, I spoke to the studio.
- Mm-hm.
- And they like the script.
They're totally on board for this film.
Fantastic. Great.
- Yeah.
- What's the catch?
Yeah, er...
They want to bring a new writer on.
What?
It's for a polish, it's just for a polish.
It's...
Hey, how are we doing?
CHLOE: Hello, how are you?
Yeah, really good.
(DISCORDANT MUSICAL NOTES)
Oh, where did you get that?
I found it.
I thought you'd lost that.
Thought I'd hidden it.
Who?
Ed Hirsch.
I don't... Who's he?
Never heard of him. What's he done?
He's written a few scripts that have
really just gotten a lot of heat.
Look, over here!
Charlie, I'm here, look.
Little fella... Hello!
He's new, he's hot,
he's up-and-coming...
I've got two Oscar nominations.
I'm new.
I'm not up-and-coming, I've arrived.
ROB: Ah.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
Buenas tardes.
ROB: Isn't it a magnificent room?
It's the Brando room. I just watched
a little clip on YouTube of him.
You can't really work out
exactly where they are.
He's very overweight at that stage.
Yeah, which is fine for Torquemada -
gives him presence.
(AS BRANDO)
I was playing Torquemada
from the Spanish Inquisition.
(PYTHONESQUE) N-N-Nobody
expects the Spanish Inquisition.
- Nobody does.
- Amongst our weaponry
are such diverse elements as fear,
surprise, a ruthless efficiency,
and an almost fanatical devotion
to the Pope.
And nice red uniforms.
(AS BRANDO) Nobody expects
the Spanish Inquisition.
Amongst our weaponry are fear,
surprise, ruthless efficiency
and an almost fanatical devotion
to the Pope.
- You're doing him in The Godfather.
- What?
- You're just doing Marlon Brando...
- I'm just doing '70s Brando.
(AS BRANDO) He always spoke like that,
with that kind of nasal thing.
(AS BRANDO) His voice was
a little higher, the way he spoke.
It was, you know...
It was like that, you know.
You've got a De Niro thing going,
you're doing your De Niro.
(AS DE NIRO) If I was doing De Niro,
I'd do it like that, you know?
That's the way... That's the way
De Niro spoke, you know.
- That's good.
- You know something about that, you know?
That's right, you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna rip your head off,
shit down your goddamn fucking neck,
you two-bit, dick-sucking,
motherfucking asshole.
That's terrific, that's terrific.
The reason you think I'm doing De Niro
when I'm doing Brando
is because De Niro himself
was influenced by Brando,
so when De Niro acts, you see residual
elements of Brando in what he does,
so you've got it the wrong way round.
So in attempting to criticise you,
I've inadvertently complimented you.
You've shown up some of the detail.
Certainly come out on top
in this exchange, then.
(SIGHS) I'm only telling you the truth.
(MIMICS BRANDO) Nobody expects
the Spanish Inquisition.
And nobody expects a comfy chair.
No, it's got to be...
(AS BRANDO) Get...
-...the comfy chair.
- Get the comfy chair.
I'm like a turtle, look at me.
Get the comfy chair.
Get the comfy chair
and a piece of lettuce.
I'm getting hungry.
Amongst our weaponry
is such diverse...
I'm turning into Woody Allen.
Woody Allen, yeah.
(AS WOODY ALLEN)
Amongst our...weaponry
is such diverse elements
as fear, surprise
and an almost fanatical devotion
to the Yankees.
Yeah.
