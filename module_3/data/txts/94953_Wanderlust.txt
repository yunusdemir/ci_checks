of a sexual nature from the
start and strong language
- Here.
- Oh...
Ready?
As I'll ever be.
Slow.
What?
No, it's good.
- "Good."
- You know what I mean.
Surely it ought to be better than "good."
You're telling me, pal!
- Joy, come on, if we can't...
- All right, all right, I'm sorry!
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
I'm just... I'm in a lot of pain,
and I'm just feeling
- really self-conscious.
- That makes two of us.
Well, if you just, I mean, if you...
More of technique
to kind of get in that way.
Sorry, "technique"?
You know what I mean.
No! No, I'm not sure I do, actually.
I'm not the one with the problem,
Joy, so don't try and...
- I'm not trying...
- ..needle away at my...
...craft.
Your craft?
I am sorry, skilled woodsman.
You're right, we really need
to work on it.
You know what, how about
instead of making jokes...
No, all right, all right, all right!
No, I'd like to finish, please.
I think you've been using
all this as an excuse.
What?
And I think you have been for months.
I don't think you want to
have sex with me, Joy.
Blimey, Neil's keen.

Morning, Claire!
Ah...
Ahhh...

Ahhh.
Oh, just, um...
...looking for a present for...

It's, uh...
It's hard to know where to start.
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.
- Morning, sir.
- Morning!
Morning, Claire.
How goes it?
Everything all right?
Thank you!
Here's a question.
How often do you masturbate?
Nice.
I'm interested.
Why?
Once or twice a week.
You're kidding?
I'm, like, once or twice
a day at this point.
Well, you're nothing if not thorough.
I think I walked in
on my mum having a wank.
Shit! I think that means the world
has to pretty much implode now.
I'm just saying.
She's allowed to masturbate!
But I thought old people
were supposed to go off sex.
It's, like, Darwin and shit.
Your mum isn't that old.
She's pretty old.
What's up?
Tom's mum's been flicking the bean.
I'm in. Hit me. Details?
You flat out disgust me.
Either he was finishing up,
or he was just getting going.
Oh, my God.
He had a catalogue.
- Catalogue?
- Yeah, like, a...
As in, like a mail order
underwear catalogue.
Oh, Jesus.
I mean, he reached for his belt
and I was like,
"What the actual fuck?"
I'm so sorry, Claire.
What do I do?
Presumably Janet's got to know?
Hmm.
How would you feel, in the first
instance, if I had a word with him?
And then, you know, of course, if we...
...if we feel, actually...
You know, if we decide we feel
a line has actually been... then...
Yeah.
We'll speak to Janet, no question.
I really am sorry, Claire.
Urgh...
Oh, no, gave up years ago.
Oh!
Sorry.
I knew that.
Freak.
- Will you have some water?
- Thank you.
Elaine?
No? OK.
It's a... It's a beautiful garden.
Aw, thank you.
Tricky time of year, er, um...
Autumn and...
...winter round the corner.
Coming frost.
So, how do...? Um...
What's the...?
I mean, do you want us to, er,
get this ball rolling or...?
It's up to you.
I can start by explaining
a little about myself. OK.
How I like to work.
The last 20 years,
I've been working with a mixture
of individuals and couples,
using primarily psychodynamic
and psychoanalytic techniques.
I like to work with
a small number of clients,
often over a period of years.
So, no quick-fixes here, I'm afraid.
And, if after this initial session
you decide to move forward,
we should aim to meet at this time
and this location
each and every week.
And if you cancel or you're
unable to attend a session,
you will, I'm afraid, still be charged.
I'm conscious this might
sound a little mercenary.
But the purpose, or the aim,
is to create a time and a space
which is entirely yours,
week on week.
A private, safe, well-bounded space
where frank, intimate
discussions can take place.
But this might not be
what you two are after.
So, um, you know, in that case, let's...
Please, let's have
a conversation about that.
But the purpose or the goal
of this first session is very much
to see if the three of us
might be able to work together.
So, feel free to size me up.
I think that all sounds...
Well, we...
Maybe a bit about us?
Mmm.
So, this was...
I was the one who suggested...
Um... Maybe that's a good...
So, some friends of ours, I said to
them, I said that Elaine and I...
I said that we've been having
a few... And he said,
"Well, have you thought about...?"
Cos him and his wife, they'd been...
You know...
Though they called it analysis,
I don't know if that...?
Therapy...?
But they said, he said, um, my friend...
...our friend, um, that it was a godsend.
They're his words.
And he is...
he is a hard bloke to please!
Um, and then that got me thinking,
"Well, if it can work then why not?"
So, we looked at your website..
Great.
...and we both really
liked the look of that.
- Great.
- So...
You will tell me, won't you,
if I'm, um, talking too...
Or rabbiting on.
I don't, um...
I'm not trying to take over.
Um...
I suppose...
...in a nutshell...
...um...
...something seems to have...
...in... in the past year or so...
...and I, um...
...I think all I want, really, is for
us to just be able to get along...
...like we used to. You know?
Perhaps, James, you could say a
little more about what you mean by,
"getting along like we used to?"
Do you want an example?
Yeah, great.
Um...
Hey, so, what're you doing tonight?
Just cos my dad's pretty much
going to be out, and I thought
we could finish that documentary
on the lactose intolerant Mormons?
Shit, do you like Franzen?
I love Franzen.
Sorry, were you talking to me?
I... I was just saying,
The Corrections is, like,
- one of my favourite books.
- Oh, OK.
Have... have you read Purity?
It's his... It's his new one,
his newest one.
I haven't.
It's seriously, seriously, um...
I mean, the bits I've...
I haven't actually... I've only just...
But the bits I've...
Oh, OK.
What the fuck was that?
It's called conversation.
Oh! I think we might need
a bucket to mop up all the semen.
Your coccyx, as you can see here,
is looking great.
Oh, well, I've always prided myself
on having a great-looking coccyx.
Any pain still?
Well, some.
And where are we up to with physio?
I'm about to start hydrotherapy.
Great.
- Sports?
- I don't really do any sports.
I mean, should I? Should I be...?
We generally advise against anything
too athletic at this stage.
- But...
- Cycling?
I'd like to start cycling again.
Regular, light, day-to-day
activities, absolutely.
What about sex?
As long as the sex isn't too athletic.
We'll schedule another check-up,
and in the meantime...
And these? What about these?
Oh!
Oh...!
- Sorry.
- Stalker!
I spoke to Neil.
Oh, shit. And?
He wants to speak to you himself.
Oh, no.
Offer you an apology in person.
He's... he's been having a bit of a...
Anyway, let's see how you're feeling
once the two of you have...
- Spoken?
- ..and if you still...
...think that he shouldn't
be wanking himself off
- in the department office?
- If you... That's how you still...
...then, yeah, then...
...yeah, we'll absolutely speak to Janet.
Yeah, crazy thing is,
I don't know why he doesn't just
use the disabled toilet
like the rest of us.
Can I interest you in a drink?
My treat.

Thought I'd take the old girl for a spin.
Congratulations, old girl.
- Here, gimme a hand.
- Please?
Please.
Does it hurt?
Oh, a bit.
How was your day?
Pretty, um, standard.
Yeah. Yours?
Yeah. Think I've probably
landed myself a new couple.
- Cool.
- Yeah.
We were going to Dublin, visit some
friends, we're on the plane,
and he says he needs to piss
and he's gone for
what feels like an eternity.
So I'm thinking, you know,
either he's working his way through
a particularly truculent...
...Harry Plopper.
Harry Plopper? Wow, is that a...?
That's... that's really a...?
I mean, Alan, if anything,
it's come and gone.
I am so out of touch.
Anyway, suddenly
this announcement starts up.
Ladies and gentleman,
this is your captain speaking.
I'd like to introduce you to
one of our fellow passengers
who has a very special
announcement to make.
- You're kidding?
- Swear to God.
This is a message for Claire Pascal
from your boyfriend Adam Cooper.
He starts rattling off
all this corny as fuck shit
and I'm just thinking,
"Please, please let this be a hoax."
Please don't do this, I'm begging you.
Claire Pascal...
...will you marry me?
It was the worst
hour and a bit of my life.
He wept, fucking uninterrupted
for the rest of that flight.
Ugh!
Well, I'm... I'm... I'm sorry, Claire.
Here's to not proposing,
OR wanking in public.
Or truculent Harry... What was it?
- Ploppers?
- Truculent Harry Ploppers.
Wait a minute, I don't understand.
Are we toasting complicated shits?
What time do you call this?
- What?
- Sit down.
Why, what's wrong?
Wha...
Tell me about your day.
There was actually a bit of an issue.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
Was somebody misbehaving?
Um... yeah.
- Was it you?
- Me?
- Huh.
- No.
No.
Oh, come on. You're always misbehaving.
I bet you've been really naughty.
Mm. Hm.
Joy, I'm... I'm... I'm quite tired.
Well, good. Because I am going...
...to wake... you... up.
- Arms up.
- Can I just...
Can I just ask a question before...?
No more talking.
OK, get up.
I thought you said no more talking?
Disobedience will not be tolerated. Up.
Ah!
Mm! Oh!
- Joy. Joy...
- Alan!
Joy. Claire walked in
on Neil masturbating.
I'm sorry.
I know. I'm sorry. I really...
I appreciate the...
...the... the attempt.
But there's an awful lot on my...
Playing on my...
The attempt?
You know what I mean.
You know what I mean.
It's... it's a lot to take in.
It's... it's elaborate,
is all I'm saying.
Well, I'm sorry
my effort to try and resuscitate
our flat-lining sex life...
Well, you... No, you're just
putting words into my mouth.
Well, I was planning on putting
something else in my mouth,
but you should be so fucking lucky.
I don't understand what's happening.
So, what, you're annoyed at me
because what I'm... I'm... I'm tired?
No! I'm disappointed because
you're not prepared to...
What?
You said you didn't believe
I wanted the two of us to have sex.
- So?
- So I want it on record
that you are the one
actively resisting intercourse.
But this isn't sex.
If you, if you'd been in bed
and I'd come home
and you'd been in bed
and... and you said,
"Er, hello, Alan, shall,
shall we have sex this evening?"
I probably would've said
"Yes, Joy, let's. How lovely."
But when I come home,
after the kind of day I've had...
God, you're so boring!
OK. Well, at least I'm not trying
to start a brawl for no other reason...
I don't wan to have
the same old sex. In fact, I refuse.
Well, at least, if we were
having the same old sex
we would, in fact, be having sex.
Why don't you want to try
something different?
- Because...
- Why can't you see
this as an opportunity to try...
I'm more than happy to try something new!
I just don't want to try something
completely and utterly
fucking ridiculous!

Kick! Kick!
Really nice. Looking great, guys.
OK. We're gonna turn it up a bit.
And a double kick.
There we go! Really great. Keep it going!
Looking fantastic, guys.
And double kick.
Nice.
Really good.
And now we're going to go into
a really nice stretch down...
...and up.
OK. And to the side.
Great. And then back to the other side.
Really good, guys.
Once more.
You guys look great and...
OK. Er... not to alarm anyone,
but it looks as if we might have
a little problem.
If we can just leave the pool.
If we can move to the side, guys.
Thanks, um, yeah,
we're going to take a break there.
Yeah, great. OK, guys??
Great. Thank you.
Well, that was quite an experience.
Oh, yeah.
I've always wanted to piss in a pool.
So you're the culprit.
- I wish.
- Ha-ha!
I'm Marvin.
Joy. Hi.
Um, see you next week, then.
You will.
I'll make sure I bring my goggles
in case you end up
pissing up a storm again.
Ha.
How are you doing?
How are YOU doing?
Oh, it's going to be like that, is it?
I'm interested.
- I'm interested in you.
- I'm interested in you.
Do you know something?
This is not what I thought
therapy was going to be like.
- Oh, no?
- No.
I mean, how long have
we been doing this now?
Long time.
Yeah, I'm still waiting for you
to wheel out one of those,
er, what do you call it,
lying down things?
Chaise longue?
Is it? I dunno, the thing
with the... with the...
...lying down and I'm looking up
and you got a proper wiry beard going on.
With your fucking
pocket watch or whatever,
and I'm telling some story about
my dad's pendulous cock and balls,
about how I've harboured some...
...you know cos I saw it
when I was eight,
and I'm still trying to get
the image out of my head.
We can talk about your dad's
pendulous cock and balls
if you like, Jason.
Well...
Or dreams. That's what
people talk about, innit?
Sometimes.
- I don't really dream.
- No?
You're more interested in
the small stuff, seems to me.
Which might be no bad thing, by the way.
Help me understand
what you mean by "small stuff".
What it means, for you,
the difference between small stuff
and big stuff, what that is.
Why there needs to be a difference.
Some things...
...have to matter more than others.
Hm. What matters to you, Jason?
I do have the occasional dream,
truth be told.
- Really?
- Mm. Yeah, yeah, well...
...sometimes.
A'ight, there's this one.
OK, I'm coming home.
I'm coming home, and I get in,
and the power's off.
Except the fridge.
Fridge is the only thing
that seems to be...
- And who do the shoes belong to?
- Fuck knows.
Shoes aren't even the weird bit.
The weird bit is
when I turn around and...
...and there's a fucking...
- Goodness.
- And she... I mean, she's ripped.
I can feel it.
I can feel my eyes...
...fucking, starting to, you know...
Drifting.
And then what happens?
I wake up.
And can you tell? Is it possible
to see who the intruder is?
No.
But I'm saying, generally speaking,
I don't really dream.
- OK, look.
- Let me see.
Holy shit.
Have you heard of The Kraus Project?
Yeah, yeah, sure.
It's great.
It's a bunch of essays?
Yeah, sort of, yeah.
Franzen, like, slaved over
translating these long, dense
Austrian essays by this guy called Kraus
who was like a satirist in the early
part of the 20th century.
- Is this actually happening?
- Have you read it?
Most of it, yeah.
I mean, not all of it but most of it.
Cool. Thanks.
Holy fuck!
Was that me or did some
actual flirting just occur?
That was some of the dullest flirting
I've literally ever seen
in my entire life.
No way.
- She wants you.
- What?
You essentially just copulated.
Anyway, so I was, like,
"Well, listen, I didn't come
"to Amsterdam solely to get stoned
and hook up with randomers.
"I can do that at home for free.
"I want to be with you."
And she was, like,
"Well, that was never the deal."
And then she said something about
getting stoned
and hooking up with randomers
is pretty much the raison d'etre
of Amsterdam.
And I thought about making
a joke about the Dutch Masters...
...but then I didn't, so then we just...
...stood there.
Mum, please spare me
the silent therapist thing.
I wasn't aware that's what I was doing.
That's because it's, like,
your default factory setting.
Stop. I'm sorry.
I really liked Mel.
Me too.
I would've come and picked you
up at the station, you know.
It's cool.
So what's new, how's Dad?
Try it now!
Ooh!
Now, look, I don't know how
you're going to feel about this,
so I'm just going to put it out there.
I'm going to smoke a joint...
...and you'd be very welcome to join me?
Or if you'd rather sit this one out
then that would also be fine.
Whatever floats your particular... boat.
Or not. Either way.
Oh!
Hi! Hello, Naomi.
- Rita, hey.
- Hi, how are you?
- I didn't realise you were back.
- It's true.
How... how... how was it?
Erm, did you, erm...
- Yeah.
- It was, er, Europe, wasn't it?
- Yes. We were sort of all over.
- Oh, right.
It was cool.
- Cool hair.
- Oh.
Obviously how you had it before was...
Oh, no. Thanks.
Erm... Oh, can I interest you
in a cannoli?
"Leave the gun, take the cannoli!"
God. Erm...
Please, er, it's...
Er...
Oh, my God!
What, too much limoncello?
Perfect.
Ah, great.
- You after Mum?
- Er, well, yes.
- Only if she's, er...
- She's with a client, but...
Oh, well, erm...
Oh, it's nothing.
Welcome to come in and wait if you want.
Right, thanks.
Thanks.
I find it unfathomable that you
have never heard of Warren G.
I mean, if this doesn't
blow your mind, I mean,
I-I don't know what will.

Neil apologised.
He did.

- Did he?
Are you asking me a question?
I just... I wasn't sure?
What did... what did I say?
"He did."
I'm sorry, I don't know.
I think I'm quite...
...stoned.
He said, er, he's been having
a little bit of trouble...
...at home.
Hm.
Maybe we ought to just...
let him keep wanking?
What time is it, please?
What time do you need to leave?
I don't know.
What time do you need to leave?
Erm, this is my...
I live here, so...
I suggested trying... something.
Suggested we try, erm...
"Now, I'm open," I said.
If there's anything in-in
particular you'd like to try,
would like the two of us to try...
I'm not suggesting that, erm,
that we enjoyed it.
I-I think we both felt that all the
screaming and the panting and the...
...relentless pounding
really wasn't our cup of tea.
But, erm, one of the women, erm...
Well, one of the women in particular,
erm...
And, historically, porn isn't
a turn on for me, but this,
this one woman in particular,
I...
...I couldn't...
Joy, erm, I couldn't...
I couldn't take my eyes off her.
And I love, I love Neil.
God, he's terrific, he really is.
But I-I think sometimes to myself...
I have thought to myself, erm,
what if?
You know?
- Hey.
- Hi.
- Listen, I'm sorry...
- I'm sorry about...
I promise I'll try to be
more civil next time
you reject me outright.
Um...
I'm joking. That was a joke.
And I-I'm...
...I'm sorry, too.
I think Neil and Rita
might be separating.

- Hi.
- Hi. How are you?
Wet.
- Joy, wasn't it?
- Yeah. Marvin.
The Martian.
Well, I'll see you next week.
You will.
Hiya.
Oh, yes!
Tea?
So that's your office?
It is, mm-hm.
What happens if you bump
into a, you know, client,
someone you're working with,
out and about?
- Not a lot.
- God, I'd be mortified.
Are you in therapy, Marvin?
I could imagine being
hypothetically mortified.
Antonia, my...
...ex, she wanted us to.
- What did you want?
- Not that.
Although if I'd known it could be
as relaxed as all this
then who knows?
You're very welcome to
take a closer look.
- Any good?
- Oh.
It's great.
Out of ten?
Oh, at least a solid nine and a half.
- High praise!
- Mm-hm.
What's the...
I don't know what you'd call it,
the most common, like, complaint?
You know, cause for concern.
Hm. It varies.
I bet.
I mean, I get lack of desire a lot.
Lack of passion.
"How can we get it back?
What happened? Where did it go?
"It used to be so natural,
now it's almost impossible."
I mean, generally speaking, we are
very bad in this country at, erm,
discussing our private lives in public.
We feel tremendous shame.
Too ashamed of our needs.
Which means a lot of the time,
by the time people make it to me,
often their relationship is, erm...
...haemorrhaging...
...very...
...badly.
- Jesus.
- Yeah.
What about if...
Sorry.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I think I need to change hands.
No, no, no, don't worry about it!
No, it's my bad hand.
It's not allowed to be athletic.
I don't even know what you do.

Oh!
Ahhh!
I'm staying with my brother.
It's been hardly any time at all, but...
...I miss her.
I thought I'd feel really angry,
but it's not, erm...
It's like a much purer form of sadness.
Oh, do you want?
Oh...
Oh, Alan, can I ask you something?
How would you feel about accompanying me
to a session of kung fu?
I've got a lot of excess
energy at the moment,
I'm feeling,
and I've always loved Bruce Lee.
Um...
...Neil, I don't really know
anything about martial arts.
Well, it's beginners.
Website says you just need
a tracksuit and, er,
a T-shirt and a willingness to try.
Yeah, anyway, it's, erm... You don't
have to give me an answer now.
It's, you know, it's just a thought.
Joy.
Yeah?
Joy, I'm really sorry,
but me and Claire, we had sex.
She was having trouble.
She couldn't get her car started.
It was raining, and...
...and we smoked a joint
and then we listened to some Warren G
and then she went down on me, Joy.
She went down on me and then we had sex.
Joy, I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry.
Alan, I tossed off a man
from my hydrotherapy group.
What?!
Jesus fucking Christ, Joy!
I mean, when?
This afternoon.
I mean, I mean, how? I
mean who, who even...
Well, he offered me a lift home
and, in order to say thank you,
I invited...
What, you grabbed his dick?!
You know what? We are both culpable.
We've both...
The difference is I've been feeling
really guilty ever since!
So have I! What makes you think...
To me right now, you look like
the opposite of guilty.
Oh, you mean I'm innocent, then.
There is a world of difference
between tossing someone off
- you hardly even know...
- Yeah, but don't you see...?
No, what happened,
the difference between what happened
between me and Claire is...
- Worse? Is more duplicitous?
- No!
Is arguably more of a betrayal?
I opted to toss him off
because I was aware
that doing anything more was...
Sorry, you opted?
What, you happened to be passing
a selection of penises and you opted...?
You know what?
No, you know what?
I think you're behaving...
You are angry and upset,
and I can understand that,
but can we at least try and...
...at least try and acknowledge
that we are both at fault?
OK, OK, OK, fine, fine. I'm sorry.
You should be.
You fucked a colleague, stoned!
You should be sorry!
Yeah, and that...
...that's what I've been trying to say.
Why did you do it?
Why did YOU?
Honestly?
What else is there at this point?
I don't enjoy having sex with you.
I think, in the last, recently,
in the last, I don't know, two,
maybe four... I just...
I haven't really been
enjoying our sex life.
I think we've stopped having fun,
and I think perhaps we stopped
communicating, in a way,
about what we...
About the things we enjoy
or what we want, or might want,
or might have wanted to try or...
And I think perhaps we're both...
I don't know...
I think, somehow, we've become
unacceptably boring in bed.
I-I didn't go looking, if that's
what you mean, I wasn't actively...
- Neither was I!
- And I feel awful,
I feel fucking awful about it.
I know. Listen, I'm not
angry with you, I don't...
Well, maybe you should be.
Maybe the fact that you're not,
maybe... maybe it makes me think,
well, is this something
you wanted to happen?
I don't want to re-invent the wheel
every time we go to bed, no.
No, nor do I, but, you know, sometimes,
I feel like doing something different.
I have felt like doing
something different.
Well, then, I think
we just need to be more...
...organised.
Why?
Because I feel happier knowing
what my day is going to entail.
Yeah, and if that makes me
unadventurous, you know what...?
No, no it doesn't make you unadventurous.
All it makes us, I think, is...
different.
Tell me what you did with Claire.
What you and Claire did.
I already have, haven't I?
- No, in detail.
- What? No!
- You're serious?
- Hm.
How did being with her
compare to being with me?
I can't even... What... What is this?!
I'd like to enjoy having sex
and, ideally, I'd like to
have more of it...
...outside of this room.
You know, not just below these sheets,
keeping our voices down once or
twice a month if we're lucky.
But if you don't...
...if you don't mind
the way it is then I think...
...I think you need to say something.
Sounds to me like you're saying
you've had enough.
Of us. Of me.
- No, that has nothing to do with...
- The sex is boring.
We've not been honest. In fact,
we've been lying to each other.
OK, yeah, those are all statements
of fact, but I'm not...
As is the fact that, for most people,
this would mean
the end of their marriage.
I don't give a shit what
this would mean for most people.
So then you tell me,
how do we come back from this?
OK, I am not saying
I've had enough. Look at me.
I am no way near having had enough.
I love you.
I love being with you.
I love the fact that we've been
together as long as we have.
I love that.
But, yeah, we have a problem because...
I love you, too.
So you should.
OK, so when you say you
want to have more sex,
do you mean more sex with me...
...or do you mean...?
Well, do you want to have sex with me?
Well, for crying out loud,
let's not! Let's just stop!
Stop?
I don't know, I mean... Maybe?
Stop having sex with each other,
you and me?
I don't know, why not?!
I mean, for once in our lives, we
could do whatever the fuck we want
and see what happens.
You know, without agonising
over it or feeling guilty or...
...sheepish or punishing ourselves
for happening to want different things.
I'm not sure I understand
what it is you're getting at.
OK, would you like to have sex
with Claire again, yes or no?
I'm not answering that. No!
There is... There is no answer to
that question that can end well.
No.
The only way this can end well is if
you answer that question honestly.
Would YOU like...?
To have sex with Claire? No.
You know what I mean.
Would I like to see Marvin again?
- His name's Marvin?
- Yes.
Yes, I would.
And don't steer this off course.
Yes, fine. Fuck, yes. Of course I would.
Then why don't we?
