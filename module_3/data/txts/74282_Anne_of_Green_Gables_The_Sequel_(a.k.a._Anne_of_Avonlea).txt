Where is sleep?
Over the mountains of the moon,
down the valley of the shadow,
Beneath the waves of
the deep gulf stream,
Replied the handsome duke
in dark languid tones.
In dark languid tones.
In dark forbodden tones.
He fervantly stroked her alibaster brow.
As she fell under his cloak of darkness.
Here's some tea for you.
Morgan, look. Do you
think she needs help?
Are you a journalist?
No, a teacher.
No, I'm a writer.
Actually I write books.
Books? -Books.
I hope nothing's spoiled, miss.
Doesn't matter. I keep it all
filed away in my imagination anyway.
Morgan, we'll be late for our lunchen.
Thank you. -Excuse me.
Bye Barbara! Don't forget your
lunchpail! -Bye Miss Sherley!
Bye Jacob! Good Luck with
your job at the Smithy.
Goodbye Minnie May!
Is that how you smoke it?
-Don't you know anything?
You have to like it to
make the paper stick.
What do you want?
My mama says smoking makes your
mouth brown and your ears stick out.
Well your mother's an old wind bag. -No, she is not!
I'm gonna tell Miss Sherley you two have been smoking.
You do and I'll sic my dog on
you. -Will not! You can't catch me!
Let's see how you like being
locked up. You little tattle-tail.
Let me go! I'm gonna tell on you two!
Let me go! I'm gonna tell on you two!
You two are bad boys and I'm gonna...
-See how you like that you tattle tail.
Yeah, we're gonna sic his dog
on you if you say anything.
Why, Minnie May!
Anthony Pye and Tommy Bell locked me in
here because I was gonna tell on those two.
They were smoking cigarettes and
Anthony's gonna sic his watch dog on me.
He'll do no such thing. Now, you run home.
Your mother will be wondering where you are.
Alright, Miss Sherley.
Ahh, Good day, Miss Sherley.
-Good Afternoon, Mr. Pye.
Must be glad school's out. I hope
my Anthony behaved himself this year.
Anthony's grades have been quite
good, and he is well liked by everyone.
I understand from Minnie May Barry that you have
an excellent watch dog looking out for you, Anthony.
Oh and that's a fact. No foxes around
our chicken coop this year, Miss Sherley.
A finer watch dog you'll never see,
so Minnie May was just telling me.
Oh and thank you, Anthony for volunteering with
Tommy to whitewash the outhouse for me next Monday.
I hear you two are quite
excellent painters. Well, I'll
be seeing you, then, Monday
morning at 9:00. Good Day.
I'm sorry. I know you're
closed, Mrs. Harrison. But
I promised Marilla I'd pick
up the mail in town today.
The post man, he left a registered card in our
box yesterday. -Lucky you caught us, Anne Shirley.
Don't know if I've seen anthing come through today,
though. -No, ma'am. No, nothing for Green Gables.
But I have a registered
card, Mrs. Sloane.
Oh, just a minute,
now. Oh! That's right!
I remember. One of them big
manilla envelopes that you've been
sending out recently did come
back yesterday registered mail.
Yes, here it is. Now.
Can't see a thing without my glasses.
-It's got yoru name on it, alright.
"Curtis Publishing Company,
Boston." Ain't they magazine people?
Must be a complimentary
subscription or some such nuisance.
Thanks so much for letting me in. Good
afternoon Mrs. Harrison, Mrs. Sloane.
So, this is why you keep disappearing on me
every time I plan to pick you up after school.
Gilbert Blythe! -All this secrecy.
You never have time to speak to your friends anymore.
-You give that back or I won't speak to you again.
Well if you're going to
be so touchy. -Thank you.
You know, people think you have been acting very
peculiarly lately, and I might as well tell you so.
Why didn't you show up at the Carmody Spring
Festival? I saved a spot for you at our table.
I was busy. I was trying
to get my finals marked.
Anne, you had your finals marked and
posted with the board before I did.
What are you up to? -Nothing.
This is a completely personal
matter. -I suppose it must be.
You can't keep your word
anymore. -Good Grief!
You know how to try
one's patience, don't you?
Don't get up on your high
horse with me, Anne Shirley.
I cycled all the way from Carmody to tell you
something I found out about Diana Barry today.
You are a real pill, Dilbert Blythe.
What about Diana Barry? -Uh-uh.
Not until you spill the beans.
You won't say anything to your folks
or Jane Andrews or Charlie Sloane?
On my honor.
And your promise, you won't ever tease me
about this. -I wouldn't risk your anger.
"Dear Miss Shirley,
We regret to return the enclosed
manuscript 'Avril's Atonement' but
are unable to accept it for publication.
Sincerely yours, Women's
Home Journal Magazine"?
You know the story I wrote this spring?
I'm attempting to have it
published. -Anne, that's tremendous!
Listen to this everybody!
Avonlea's public school teacher soon
to become world famous Canadian author-
It hasn't happened yet, you fool!
And don't you dare tell anyone.
Now what's all the
fuss about Diana Barry?
Well from what I understand, she's going
on an extended vacation this summer.
Is that all? Where is she going?
-You mean, with whom is she going?
Alright, with whom, then?
What difference does it make?
-Fred Wright obviously makes
a lot of difference to her.
He's proposed and Diana has accepted.
Proposed? -Charlie Sloane
found out from Fred himself.
Roly Poly Fred Wright?
But they hardly know each other.
Of all the stupid, sentimental
things for Diana to do.
I didn't even know it was like this.
She probably only accepted because
Fred was the first person to
even ask her. -Don't be silly.
Fred's a terrific fellow.
-He better steer clear of me.
He has no business waltzing in, stealing my
best friend. -You're not jealous, are you?
No.
Just disappointed.
Why do people have to
grow up and marry, change?
Oh, you'll change. If someone ever admitted
that they were head over heels for you,
You'd be swept off your feet
in a moment. -I would not.
And I defy anyone who would
try and make me change. -You do?
Last one to the bridge
is a stuffed goose!
Cheaters never prosper, Anne Shirley.
Watch out, Rover!
You've had it now, Miss Sherley.
Sorry, Diana. -Sorry.
But Gil, he fell in the brook.
Well, thank you for the lovely walk, Diana.
-Please thank your mother for the crochets.
Myra Gillis had 37 doilies when she got married and
I'm determined to have at least as many as she had.
I suppose it would be impossible
to keep house with only 36 doilies.
But I assure you, Mr. Wright, Diana will be
the sweetest little homemaker in the world.
So long as you can afford to
let her keep up with the Gillis'.
Well, I hope so. Good
day, ladies, Gilbert.
Well, I better go get my bicycle.
I'll talk to you ladies later. Bye.
Anne Shirley, that was...
I've never been so
humiliated in all my life.
That was the meanest-
How could you make fun of me in
public? -Diana, I wasn't making fun.
I was just teasing.
I'm sorry. -You always have
to be the center of attention
whenever Gilbert Blythe is in
anyone's company. -That's not true.
Please, forgive me Diana. I
didn't mean to pick a quarrel.
Why couldn't you have told me
about you and Fred yourself?
I feel like I lost my best friend.
You were so busy writing your
book and marking exam papers.
It just happened.
Then he asked.
I'm really happy.
But it does seem ridiculous to think
of me being engaged to Fred, doesn't it?
I don't care what he looks like. He's
got a good heart. He's so thoughtful.
We'll probably make a pudgy old
couple some day. But it doesn't matter.
I'm glad for you, Diana. -Don't
you ever mean to get married?
Perhaps. If I meet the right one...
What about Gilbert?
-Gilbert's just a chum.
I don't care for him that way.
You know what my ideal is, Diana.
Tall, irresistably handsome,
proud, and melancholy.
But people's ideals change sometimes.
Mine wouldn't. And I wouldn't care
for any man who didn't fulfill them.
What if you never meet him?
-Then I shall die an old maid.
I suppose you're right
to be discriminating.
Half the men across the country will be
courting you when your story's published.
You're going to be famous
and I'll be so proud.
What is it?
"Women's Home Journal"
sent it back. -What?
The editor must be crazy!
What reason did he give?
No reason at all. Just a printed slip saying
it wasn't acceptable. -That's ridiculous!
He mustn't have read it. I'm going
to cancel my subscription immediately.
"Avril's Atonement." It sounded
so inspriing and romantic.
If you can tell me truthfully, Diana, if
you can recall any major faults in my story?
The part where Avril makes the cake.
It doesn't
- It doesn't seem to match the rest of the story.
But that's one of the most
romantic parts in the whole story!
It's a well known fact that great ladies of old
believed that the culinary arts also fed the soul.
Well, I'll have to read it again to
remember what my first opinion was.
If you let me keep it, maybe
I can suggest some changes.
You don't know how discouraging
it is to get a rejection, Diana.
And right when I'm in the midst of
writing a new epic: "Rosaline's Revenge."
It certainly takes the bloom off the
rose. -Don't be discouraged, Anne.
Anne Shirley! I'm not going
to put with this a day longer.
I warned Marilla not to let
it happen again. Well, it has.
Patience has ceased to be a virtue.
I want this rumpus stopped right now.
Would you just calm down and tell
me what the trouble is. -Calm down?
First it was our potatoes. Then my June lilies,
which Thomas planted on our 25th wedding anniversary.
Now this darn jersey cow's devoured
almost all my prize-winning cabbages.
And if Tillie Boulter walks away with the
red ribbon at the Charlottetown exhibition,
you can let Marilla know I am
holding her financially responsible.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lynde because
Dolly is my cow, not Marilla's.
Matthew bought her for me two years
ago as a calf from Mr. Bell. -Sorry?
Well, sorry is not going to help the habit
this cow has made trampling through my cabbages.
And if you think... -I am sorry.
But the fence that separates your potato
field from our pasture is an eyesore.
And if you'd keeep it in
better repair, Dolly wouldn't
have broken in. -A jail fence
wouldn't keep that devil out!
And what's more, my Thomas has been far too
ill the past six months to repair any fences.
And I know one thing, you red-headed snippet!
You'd be better employed fixing that fence yourself,
rather than mooning around, wasting your
time, writing for some rubbishy magazine.
I would rather spend my time profitably
than squander it in idle gossip,
meddling in other people's affairs.
I won't cherish any hard feelings against
you because of your narrow minded opinions.
But thank goodness I have an imagination
which allows me to understand how it must be
to find a cow amongst prize-winning cabbages.
Dolly shall never break into your field again.
I give you my word of honor on that point.
Well, you just make
sure that she doesn't!
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. -Well Marilla, I hope that
canal horse destroys your tomato patch next.
And don't expect any sympathy from your girl. I've
always warned you she had a temper to match her hair.
Oh, good Lord.
She can't possibly get out now
unless she tears the fence down.
I never realized Mrs. Lynde was such a crank.
-There's certainly nothing of a kindred spirit in her.
You set your heart too much on frivolous things and
then crash down into despair when you don't get them.
I know. I can't help flying up
on the winds of anticipation.
It's as glorious as soaring through
a sunset. It almost pays for the thud.
Well, maybe it does. But I'd rather walk calmly
along and do without both flying and thud.
Marin. He's forgotten
the cows on Orchard Slope.
I was as polite as I could be,
under the circumstances, Marilla.
And I apologized, despite
her stinging personal remarks.
Rachel specializes in getting
under people's skin, I know.
But you ought to have bit your tongue,
Anne, seeing as we were in the wrong.
No, I ought to have sold Dolly to Gilbert's
father a month ago when he wanted to buy her.
I thought it was just as well to wait until
the auction and let all the stock go together.
Martin! There are two more cows!
Rachel will get over this. Her nerves
have been raw lately, and deservedly so.
Thomas is pretty bad, and Dr. Spencer says
that he won't be with us for very long.
I hope she doesn't have to sell her
farm, that would be a terrible loss.
I know how we felt when Matthew died.
Anne, I wanted to talk to you about something for
a while. I know you've been content enough here.
But I never feel at ease thinking about how you've
been given up so much of your own opportunity.
Marilla, I couldn't
leave you alone here.
Besides, I'd probably make a much
better teacher than a writer, any day.
Anne, you've been my comfort any
my joy since Matthew passed away.
But I've promised myself that when you
gave up the Avery scholarship to stay home,
I'd make it up to you one day. -I've
never been sorry I stayed for a moment.
Mr. Barry has really taken
over the farm almost completely.
And my eyesight is so much better
now, I can manage with Martin.
Perhaps one of the Piccard girls over in
Rustico could board with me for a while
so you could dust off some of your ambitions
if you like. What do you think about that?
Oh Marilla, I feel as though someone's handed me
the moon and I don't exactly know what to do with it.
Matthew and I spent 40
years looking after papa.
Perhaps I never mentioned it
before, but I can't help but confess
it was with a regretful heart at times.
You had a little bit of romance
in your own life, Marilla.
You wouldn't think it
to look at me, would you?
But you can never tell about
people by their outsides.
Do you suppose that Mr. Blythe
remembers that he was your beau?
Stuff and nonsense. Oh, no. That's
enough now. No more foolishness.
Oh it seems so funny and horrible to
think of Diana marrying Fred. Doesn't it?
What is so horrible about it?
Well he certainly isn't the wild, dashing
young man Diana used to want to marry.
Fred is extremely good.
That is exactly what he should be.
Would you want to marry a wicked man?
Well I wouldn't marry
anyone who was really wicked,
but I think I'd like it if he
could be wicked and wouldn't.
You'll have more sense someday, I hope.
I believe Anne Shirley
just copied that story.
I am sure I remember reading
it in a newspaper years ago.
Well, I'm sorry to hear
she's taken to writing novels
at all. Nobody born and
bred in Avonlea would do it.
Been writing anymore stories lately,
Miss Shirley? -No, Mrs. Harrison.
Well, no offense, ma'am. Mable Sloane
here says that she found another one of
them big manilla envelopes come through
here a couple of weeks ago, that's all.
It was addressed to the Rollings Reliable
Baking Powder Company in Montreal.
My suspicion that someone was trying
for that prize that they were offering
for the best story introducing
the new baking powder.
The address wasn't in your
handwriting, though. -I should hope not.
I'd never dream of competing
for anything so disgraceful.
It would be almost as bad as
Jake Griffith's Chataghua Show.
But that's what comes of
Marilla Cuthbert adopting an
orphan from Goodness-knows-where
or what kind of parents.
Why, Anne! Congratulations!
You have such a way of
putting Avonlea on the map.
Thank you. But what do you
mean? Congratulation for what?
You were always such a terrible fake
at modesty, even during public school.
Well, there's nothing fake about the business
Lawson's General Store intends to do from all this.
And I think that blue you're wearing
is so dramatic for a young authoress.
You look almost pretty in it. -Ah,
don't say things you don't mean, Josie.
That Anne Shirley is so smug. -That
girl always did give herself airs.
Congratulations, Anne! Congratulations.
Congratulations, Anne. Splendid
story, Anne. You deserve the best.
Congratulations, Miss Shirley! I
really liked the part about the cake!
Great Jehoshephat!
Anne Shirley, we've been trying
to track you down everywhere.
Ladies and Gentlemen, may I present
to you Avonlea's famous authoress.
Father, come out here!
Oh my Goodness, Miss Shirley.
I don't understand. -You
won the contest, you goose!
And I knew you'd go into it all behind
our backs. -Quiet everybody. Quiet, please.
It is my great pleasure as
official purveyor to Avonlea
of the Rollings Reliable Baking Powder
Company to read this, following tribute.
"Miss Anne Shirley, Green Gables, P.E.I.
"Dear Madam: We have much
pleasure in informing you
that your charming
story "Avril's Atonement"
has won the $100 grand prize
in our recent competition for the best story
introducing the name of our revered product.
The prize will be presented by Mr. Charles
Lawson of Lawson's General, Avonlea.
We have arranged publication of the story in
several prominent newspaper across the country
and will supply it in pamphlet form
for distribution among our patrons.
Thanking you for the interest you have
shown in supporting our enterprises,
We remain yours very truly, The
Rollings Reliable Baking Powder Company."
You'll sign mine, won't you?
Here. Oh! And I'm sure Miss Shirley will
be happy to sign everyone's brochure.
And don't forget your purchase
of this remarkable product.
Anne!
Oh, I'm wild with delight!
I was sure I would win, when
I sent it into the competition.
Diana Barry! -Yes I did.
I thought of your story in a minute
when I saw the ad in the paper.
Miss Shirley, will you
sign this for my daughter?
Well, I was going to tell you
to send it in yourself. But
I figured you had little faith
left in you, you wouldn't.
So I sent my copy.
Then if you hadn't won,
you would never have known
because the stories that
failed weren't being sent back.
Why, Anne, you don't seem a bit pleased. -Of
course, I couldn't be anything but pleased.
It was the gesture of a true
friend to try and boost my spirits.
But there isn't a word
about baking powder.
Oh, I put that in. It was as easy as a wink.
You know the scene where Avril makes the cake?
Well, I just stated that she used Rollings
Reliable and that's why it turned out so well.
See? And then here, in the last paragraph where
Percival clasps Avril in his arms and says:
"Sweetheart, the beautiful coming years will
bring us the fulfillment of our house of dreams."
I added: "... in which we will never use
any baking powder except Rollings Reliable."
Come on, I have the
buggy. I'll take you home.
You won $100! Prissy Grant told me that
'Canadian Women' only pays $5 a story.
I can't take it. It's
righfully yours, Diana.
You sent in the story in
and made the alterations.
I certainly wouldn't have sent
it in. You have to take it.
I'd like to see myself! It
wasn't any trouble, Anne.
The honor of being the best friend
of the prize winner is enough for me.
I'm so glad for your sake.
I think you're the sweetest and
truest friend in the world, Diana.
I will buy your wedding gift with this.
-Don't you dare spend it all on me.
I got a letter today from our
dear old teacher, Miss Stacey.
She is head of the King's County Board of
Education in New Brunswick. -What a promotion.
And apparently there's a position she's recommended
for me, at a ladies' college in Kingsport.
How flattering. You wouldn't
actually leave, would you?
No, but I ought to apply anyway. She's
gone to all this trouble, and I wouldn't...
STOP, DIANA!
Anne! You'll ruin your dress
in that muddy field! Ruin it!
She'll never get that
cow all by herself.
Come back!
Stop!
Anne Shirley, you are being ridiculous!
Get out of the field this minute!
I don't care about my dress!
I must get the cow before
Rachel Lynde sees her!
Alright, Diana, run! Corner her!
That's it, Diana! Now,
don't frighten her.
This is what you've got to do:
Maybe if we can get a hold of her we can
force her over the fence into our field.
Okay, you fill the gap. And I'm going to
make a fun for it, straight toward her.
With any luck she'll jump the fence. -You mean you're
actually going to walk through that mulch, do you?
It's the lesser of the two evils, Diana.
Or she'll get into Rachel's
cabbage patch again.
Alright! I have the gap blocked.
Here, Dolly. Good Girl. Shoo! Come on!
You wretched cow!
Don't even think about
Rachel's cabbages.
Oh, Anne. You stupid cow.
Well, the elegant and
illustrious Miss Shirley.
Relaxed while seeking out ideas for her next
Rollings Reliable writing assignment, I presume.
Well, do you suppose I'm here to chat
with the bullfrogs? Be a gentleman.
You'd've been better off selling her
last month when dad offered to buy her.
Well, I'll sell Dolly to him
right now, if he wants her.
You may have our darn jersey
anytime you want to, Mr. Blythe.
Well, this very minute, for that matter.
Done! I'll give you the
$20 I offered before.
Gil can drive her over to
Carmody right now and she'll
go to town with the rest of
the shipments this evening.
I promised Mr. Reed
of Brighton a jersey.
What will Marilla say? -She won't care.
Dolly was my cow, anyway. It's not likely
she'll bring more than $20 at the auction.
But when Rachel sees this field,
she'll know Dolly was loose.
Anne, I'll be over this afternoon with
your $20... -Well, it's taught me a lesson.
Not to tstake my word of honor on cows.
How do you think a mother
would feel if she found her
child tattooed all over with
a baking powder advertisement?
I love my story, and I wrote it
out of the best that was in me.
Oh, you're just tired.
Besides, why should you care? $100 is
more than you make in two
month's teaching anyway.
Josie Pye and Tillie Boulter
can't wait to pounce on it.
Oh, they're spiteful old
cats. You're just the first
person in pokey old Avonlea
to try anything like that.
All pioneers are considered to be
afflicted with moonstruck madness.
Mad to think I could write anything
better than a baking powder advertisement.
This has dampened any spark of ambition.
I shall never write another story again.
-Oh, I wouldn't give up all together.
Maybe if you just let your
characters speak everyday English,
instead of all that
highfalutin mumbo-jumbo.
You think my story's full
of faults, too, don't you?
"Wilt thou give up thy garter,
oh fairest of the fair"?
Anne, nobody speaks that way. And look at that sap
Percival who sits around mooning the entire time.
He never lets a girl get a word in edgewise.
In real life she'd have pitched him.
His poetry would win any girl's heart.
Well, if you want my opinion, Miss Shirley,
I'd write about places I knew something of
and people that spoke everyday English.
Instead of these silly schoolgirl
romances. -I don't share your opinion.
I am not your horse, Mr. Blythe. -I'm just
trying to give you a bit of friendly advice.
Is that so? -Take the $100
and write a REAL story about the people
you care about, right here in Avonlea.
Well, you certainly
wouldn't be one of them.
Pitching and mooning?
You know, you're about as intellectual
as Charlie and Moody and Fred
and all the rest of the
boys who can only think of
finding some silly girl to
marry and keep a house for them.
Well you can cry and feel
sorry for yourself all you want,
but it won't help you
write a better novel.
Will you still come with me to
Fred's clambake next Tuesday?
Listen, Anne, I'm sorry.
Will you let me walk you back?
I was just trying to be helpful...
You know you get my back up sometimes.
Listen, I'm sorry. What else can I do?
Let me get a word in edgewise
once in a while before I pitch you!
Good day, Marilla. -Well, John Blythe.
We haven't seen you around
these parts much, lately.
Well, I haven't much time
for social calls now-a-days.
The old place still looks as pretty, though.
-The old buildings are getting worn down,
but people in Avonlea still say that it's
the loveliest old spot on the North Shore.
It is that.
Some things never
change, even in 30 years.
I'm looking for my boy.
Yes, Anne and he are
walking by the pond.
Maybe, would you like to sit
a while until they come back?
Thanks, but we're taking a shipment
in to Charlottetown before dark.
I best go and find them.
Anne! What about your $20 for the cow?
The apple doesn't fall far from the
tree, does it? Good day, Marilla.
There, There...
You take things too much
to heart, Anne Shirley.
Oh, Marilla. It's been such a Jonah day.
Rollings Reliable, Dolly, Gilbert.
Now, now. Jonah days come
to everybody. God knows best.
You used to say: "Tomorrow is
always fresh with no mistakes."
Do you remember?
Oh, what a girl you were for
making mistakes in them days. Hmm?
I used to think you were possessed.
Mind the time you dyed your hair?
Oh, Lord. -Oh, what a worry
my red hair used to be.
I'm afraid I've never been able to
endure personal criticism very well.
Gilbert gave his honest opinion
about my story this afternoon.
Oh, my temper always
gets the better of me!
I whipped him as hard as I
could. -I'm glad to hear it.
The Blythes have always been far
too opinionated for their own good.
No, Marilla. He was right. And I've
made a terrible idiot of myself.
You don't know how spiteful
I was. -I can imagine.
Our friendship, it won't
ever be the same now.
Why can't he just be sensible instead
of acting like a sentimental schoolboy?
Because he loves you. -He loves me?
I can't know why.
Because you made Josie
Pye and Ruby Gillis
and all of those wishy-washy
young ladies who waltzed by him,
look like spineless nothings.
Marilla, he's hardly my
idea of a romantic suitor.
Anne, you have tricked something out of that
imagination of yours that you call romance.
Have you forgotten how he gave up the Avonlea
school for you so that you could stay here with me?
He picked you up everyday in his carriage so
that you could study your courses together.
Don't toss it away for some
ridiculous ideal that doesn't exist.
Now, you come downstairs
and see if a good cup of tea
and some of those plum puffs
I made today don't hearten you.
Plum puffs won't minister
to a mind diseased
in a world that's crumbled into pieces.
Well, I'm glad to see that your dented
spirits haven't injured your tongue.
I suppose it's just as
well you sold the darn cow.
Though you do do things in a
dreadful head longed fashion.
I only pray Rachel doesn't burst a blood
vessel when she sees her potato fields today.
I've decided to write Miss Stacey and ask her
for more particulars on this ladies' college.
I think that's a wise idea, Anne.
Go out and find me a
couple of eggs, will you?
I don't know how in heaven's
name Dolly got out of that pen.
She must have just
broken some of the boards.
Oh, No!
Marilla! Dolly's here! -Anne? What in
heaven's name is the matter with you?
What will I do? Oh, this is
terrible. It's all my fault.
I must learn to reflect a little
before I go charging ahead recklessly!
Anne Shirley, you are the most exasperating
girl. What is it that you've done?
I've sold Rachel Lynde's jersey cow, the one
they bought in Carmody last spring, to Mr. Blythe.
And Dolly is here this very minute in
the milking pen! -Anne, are you dreaming?
No, I only wish I were. There's no dream
about it. It's very much like a nightmare.
That is Dolly. -Rachel Lynde's
cow is in Charlottetown by now.
Marilla, I thought I was finished
getting into scrapes, and here I am
in the very worst one I
was in in my entire life.
What can I do? -Do? There's nothing to do
but to go to go and tell Rachel the truth.
You just going to have to learn to
settle down and pay head to things.
I've humiliated myself
into the very dust.
Perhaps she'll accept a plate of
plum puffs as a peace offering.
Oh, no. If she's that cross, what
will she be when I say what I've done?
If she gives you the chance
to say anything at all.
Afternoon, Thomas. -Afternoon, Marilla.
Afternoon, Rachel. -Marilla,
Anne. I'm glad you've come.
I certainly had no intention of visiting you people
after being flown at as I was on my last visit.
Well, it would appear that some kind
of cuffuffle has come out of this
Anne would like to... -Please,
Marilla. I'm not finished yet.
On reflection I realized
that I was partly to blame.
I had no right to be so ill-tempered with you. And I'm not one
of them who can never be brought to own up to their mistakes.
I'd like to apologize
to you, Anne Shirley,
and I wonder if you'd sign my
copy of your 'Avril's Atonement'.
The money they pay for such
lies is perfectly amazing, but
I read it to my Thomas
and we were both moved.
I'm much obliged to you as it's
the only entertainment he's had
in the past six months.
I laughed so hard I'm not sure
it wasn't good for my heart.
I'm so pleased!
Come and lay off your things.
You'll stay to tea, won't you?
Thank you, Rachel.
It's nothing short of a wonder how you've
improved, Anne, in looks and talent.
I'm not overly partial to the pale, wide-eyed
style, myself; I prefer more snap and color
But you do make them other Avonlea girls
with showy good looks seem kind of overdone.
Like my June lilies alongside
them big red peonies, that's what.
Here's your tea, Thomas.
-I don't want tea.
Now, now, Thomas. You just finish
you nap here and get some fresh air.
I really - I wanted to confess
something to you, Mrs. Lynde.
It's about the jersey cow. -I saw my
trampled potato fields this morning.
Never mind, Anne. It makes no difference
now. -If only it were that, Mrs. Lynde.
But it's ten times worse. -Well, you're
never safe from surprise till you're dead.
Don't tell me she's done in the last of my
cabbages, too. -It's not the cabbages, Mrs. Lynde.
I'll tell you everything. Just please
don't interrupt. It's making me nervous.
Rachel! -Thomas, you're
supposed to be snoozing!
See, Diana and I chased a certain jersey
cow out of your potato field, yesterday.
Well, you can't imagine
what a difficult time we had.
I was so dreadfully tired and
wet and cross after it all.
Well, I sold the cow on the
spot to the Blythes for $20.
I hope you're not vexed with her, Marilla.
She should have consulted you first.
So long as my cabbages are safe,
we'll just pretend it didn't happen.
See, this morning, I found my Dolly
still shut up in our milking pen.
It was your cow that Anne
sold to John Blythe, Rachel.
And it was shipped out right away
on the afternoon train by Mr. Blythe.
You will find our jersey is as good as
yours. Or perhaps you'd prefer the $20.
Marilla Cuthbert!
We paid more than $50
for our cow, and I have no
intention of accepting that
varmint of yours in exchange.
You have admitted you are
partially to blame for all of this!
Anne Shirley, you are too
heedless and impulsive. You just
go on and do whatever comes
into your head, that's what.
Well, in this world you pay for your mistakes
and you can certainly afford to pay now!
Well, you have certainly made a
fine exhibition of yourself, Rachel.
Falling all over this girl
because she's a success.
It's plain to see now
what your true colors are.
I'm coming Thomas! Oh, that
man. If he'd just brave up and
exert his willpower a little,
he'd get better in no time.
It's a wonder to me that he dared to get
sick at all without asking her permission.
Come along, Anne. We'll pay her her $50.
Thomas!
Thomas! Dear God, please don't take him.
What is it, Thomas?
Where's his medicine,
Rachel? -It's in the cupboard.
Is this it? -Yes.
Rachel. -Yes, Thomas? What is it?
I... -What is it? I can't hear
you. What is it? Oh, Thomas!
Rachel, I'm afraid
there's nothing we can do.
All our debts are settled. I
expect I'll go west to my Robert.
If he'll have me.
The farm is mortgaged and
now it will have to be sold.
Now, Rachel, pull yourself together.
Well, I'm no jelly fish.
But, a woman my age doesn't
make friends and interestes
easily, that's all.
It breaks my heart to
think of leaving Avonlea.
How are you feeling tonight, Rachel?
A little better I
think, thank you, Anne.
Here's my gift, paid for out of
the proceeds of the jersey cow.
It's not much of a party
gift, but you tell them that I
plan to give them my zigzag
quilt as a wedding present.
Why, Anne, you haven't worn that
dress in ages. You look lovely.
Thank you, Marilla.
Gilbert Blythe will be mighty
proud. Why isn't he here yet?
Put on you sweater. It's
going to be cool this evening.
I'm going alone, Rachel. I hope you don't
mind my taking the carriage, Marilla.
No, no.
You did put my name on the card, I hope?
Of course, Marilla. Goodbye,
now. Goodbye, Rachel.
Have a lovely time. -Be careful you don't get your
skirt caught in the wheel of the haywain, Anne.
Well, Marilla. You know I pride
myself on speaking my mind.
I smell trouble, and
I don't mind saying so.
Providence matched them two up since they were
children, that's what. -And they are children still.
She's 18 and I was married by that time.
But Anne's grown too much like you, Marilla.
But Anne's grown too
much like you, Marilla.
It's the overparticular
ones that get left behind.
And it is the over opinionated that end up
unhappy and meaner than second skimmings.
Oh! This is glorious!
Do you remember the time we
slept all night in the hay loft?
And I was so frightened we were going to be
attacked by that barn owl that- -Come on, Diana.
We have to organize
the gifts. -Duty calls.
