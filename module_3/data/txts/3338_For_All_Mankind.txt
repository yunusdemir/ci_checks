We choose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon...
We choose to go to the moon in this
decade and do the other things,
not because they are easy,
but because they are hard.
We set sail
on this new sea...
because there is new
knowledge to be gained...
and new rights to be won,
and they must be won
and used...
for the progress
of all mankind.
We shall send to the moon,
240,000 miles away...
from the control station
in Houston,
a giant rocket...
more than 300 feet tall,
made of new metal alloys,
some of which have not yet
been invented,
capable of standing heat
and stresses...
several times more
than have ever been experienced,
fitted together with a precision
better than the finest watch,
carrying all the equipment
needed for propulsion,
guidance, control,
communications, food and survival,
on an untried mission...
to an unknown celestial body.
And, therefore,
as we set sail,
we ask God's blessing
on the most hazardous...
and dangerous and greatest adventure
on which man has ever embarked.
Thank you.
Just like a person
waiting in the wings to go on stage,
they probably have less time
to daydream...
because they're trying to
remember what they've gotta do.
You know, I had the feeling I really
ought to concentrate on remembering...
the things that I had to do
at the moon and all that.
Gosh, here
we are, and we're getting down close.
I hope the suit
checks out okay.
You get sweaty palms...
and heart starts pounding.
It's like the big game
about to start.
You're in
your work clothes, ready to go to
work.
But you still
have to stay there.
You have to schedule it in conjunction
with the booster schedule itself.
You're plugged into a console
that's supplying 100 % oxygen.
There's kind
of a catch-up time...
if there's a problem
with the booster or something,
we're there at the pad until the count
gets to a certain point,
and then we're called
to proceed to the spacecraft.
Y'all take care, now.
Godspeed, men.
At the last minute, there was
a psychological block there...
that said,
"Don't count on this so heavily.
It might not happen."
This is such a big thing. I frankly
don't see how you can do it.
Even when participating in it, I think
it's audacious that you would
try.
I clearly could never
understand, as a crewman,
how to make it work.
I could only learn
how to operate my share of it.
Being command pilot, I was
sitting in the center seat,
so that meant
I climbed in last.
I just stood around and waited
till they strapped in.
And here was kind
of a strange quiet.
You can look out and you can see
a large part of the state...
and the ocean
and this thing out here.
You have the feeling
that it's alive.
That's the kind of thing that
sort of, for the first time,
begins to bring home the fact...
that today is not the game we've been
playing in training for years.
This is reality.
I had the only window
at this point,
and I looked out, and doggone if the
moon wasn’t visible in the daylight...
right straight out
the top of the window.
I know they're doing their job,
because the moon is right ahead...
and that's where we're pointed.
They're just gonna launch us
right straight to this thing.
This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control.
All still go
on the Apollo mission...
the flight to land
the first men on the moon.
The spacecraft also now
is on full internal power.
Up to this time, it had been sharing
the load with an external power
source.
Once we get down to the three minute
and ten second mark in the countdown,
we'll go on
an automatic sequence.
All aspects from there on down
will be automatic,
run by the ground master computer
here in the firing room.
We have some 7.6 million pounds
of thrust pushing the vehicle upward,
a vehicle that weighs close to
six and a half million pounds.
We all are in this
together as a team effort.
We're gonna make it work.
And I don't know
how to make it work.
I don't know how to do
most of this mission.
But I do know that I can assure you
that my piece of it is gonna work,
and it won't fail
because of me.
The members of the launch team
here in the control center...
are monitoring a number
of what we call red line values.
These are tolerances we don't
want to go above or below...
in temperatures and pressures.
They are standing by to call out
any deviations from our plans.
The supervisor has informed launch
vehicle testing you are go for launch.
Three minutes, 25 seconds and counting.
We are still go at this time.
There's a long period of time...
when you've done all the things you can,
and there are few things left to say.
You don't know any new jokes
to tell.
There's just not much left
to say except just sit there and wait.
And it feels good.
Astronauts report it feels good.
One minute, 25 seconds and counting.
Our status board indicates
the third stage completely pressurized.
Guidance system goes on internal
at 17 seconds,
leading up to the ignition
sequence at 8.9 seconds.
Power transfer is complete.
Firing command coming in now.
We are on the automatic sequence.
T minus 60 seconds and counting.
We're on internal power with
the launch vehicle at this time.
All the second stage tanks
now pressurizing.
Thirty-five seconds
and counting.
It won't fail because of me.
T minus 20 seconds and counting.
Guidance internal.
15, 14,
13, 12, 11,
10, 9, engines on,
five, four, three, in two,
launch commit.
Yahoo!
It feels just like it sounds.
I got a pitch and a roll
program and this baby is really going.
Roger that.
Stand by for mode one bravo.
Mark one bravo.
That's a lovely liftoff.
That's not bad at all.
There's a moment
there just of supreme elation,
a complete release
of tensions.
To feel all that power
precisely directed,
to know that we're on course,
first of all for Earth orbit,
and then precisely inserted
onto the right orbit,
the right trajectory,
for rendezvous with the moon.
Apollo, Houston. You're
right smack dab on the trajectory.
Your I.U.'s doing
a beautiful job.
I got a yaw program.
Trajectory's good. Thrust is good.
We're on our way, Houston.
At last, I'm leaving the
earth and I'm destined for the moon.
What a ride. What a ride.
Roger. We copy, Pete.
Roger. Looks good up here too.
Roll's complete.
This is really
a rocking rolling ride.
You can feel it shake.
There's a real strong vibration.
Of course, you're up
at the end of this beauty.
Here you are,
going along with the G on ya.
It's up to about four Gs, but you're
psyched up, good shape and all that.
Even lifting your arm
to move switches... no problem.
Apollo, you are go for staging.
Here you are coming up on staging,
and when staging happens,
it's, like, man!
We got skirt step.
And that's for ignition,
Houston.
- Thrust is go.
- Roger.
Trajectory, guidance,
C.M.C. Are all go.
Thank you, Joe.
Houston, you're looking
good here, right down the center line.
That was shutdown
right on the money.
17 Houston,
you are go for orbit.
And we're out over the Canaries.
Apollo, Houston through
the Canaries. How do you read?
Loud and clear, Houston.
Over the Canaries.
Boy, it's just beautiful
up here looking out the window.
It's just really fantastic.
Roger.
Let me tell ya
a little bit about the ride.
Uh, John, this is Houston.
If there's nothing startling to report
about the ride, we'd rather hold off.
No, there's nothing really
different to report on the ride.
We'll hold off on that.
The sunset is just as
beautiful as always in this business.
In Africa, there are
a lot of nomads out in the desert.
Clear desert nights, you see
the fires from all of these...
these little yellow dots
that represent the fires...
from all these nomads
camping out.
And you realize the broad area
you're looking at.
And each of those little dots
represented people...
other humans that are out there
in an environment...
I would consider more strange than
they might think about... me.
When you get there into orbit,
the engines shut down and things
sorta feel sorta funny.
And you sorta unbuckle
your seat belt...
and wiggle around in your seat
or tap your toes...
and all of a sudden you're just bodies
everywhere in the room...
and you're just doing flips
and can't wheels and spins.
Your first feelings of
weightlessness as it hits
you...
is like going down a country
road about 60 miles an hour,
And then you get over the bump, and
you get that good sensation feeling...
and then, boom,
you're back down again.
Only when you're in space
and you go into weightlessness,
you go over that bump
and you never come down.
Uh, 12 Houston, your program
alarm was an integration problem.
Can you give us a verb 96
to stop your integration...
and we'd like you to do
an E mod dump.
Give us a 3-2-1 mark
when you do your verb 74,
and if we get it done now,
we should have an answer for ya
on your erasable memory...
by the time you get to Guaymas.
Do a verb 96 first.
We had a great deal of difficulty...
paying attention
to what our job was.
Already I was getting
the impression...
that this is such an amazing thing
that I'm gonna forget these things.
I know I'm going to lose this image.
It's going to be replaced with another.
Each image came up, was there for
a flash to be appreciated and savored...
and then let go because you know
it's gonna be superposed with others.
And, Houston, we're beginning
to see a beautiful sunrise here.
Okay. We're giving you a go
for your E.V.A. At this time.
Okay.
The hatch is open. No sweat.
Ah, it stayed
just where I wanted it.
Dave, come on out
wherever you are.
When you're
outside in one of those spacesuits,
you're really in space.
There are no boundaries
to what you're seeing.
It's like having a goldfish bowl
over your head...
which gives you
unlimited visibility.
And then the portable life support
system is just very, very quiet.
You know, there's a water pump in it
that's circulating water...
through your underwear...
you know, cooling water.
And there's a fan that's pumping the
oxygen through, but they're very quiet.
You can't hear them at all.
It's as if you're out there
without anything on.
Hallelujah. Hallelujah, Houston.
There's a total complete
silence and that beautiful view...
and the realization, of course,
that you're going 25,000 miles an hour.
You recognize that you're not
there because you deserve to be there.
You were just lucky.
You're the representative
of humanity at that point in history...
having that experience,
in a sense, for the rest of mankind.
The flight director says get back in.
Apollo Control Houston. Two
hours, 25 minutes ground elapsed time.
It will be during this pass that we will
have the translunar injection burn.
Capcom, we're go for T.L.I.
Roger. Guys, I've got the word
you wanted to hear.
You are go for T.L.I.
You're go for the moon.
If there's anything to be
remorseful about on going to the moon,
it was you didn't get to spend as much
time around the earth as you'd like...
because there's an awful lot of
very interesting things to see.
Three, two, one, ignition.
We confirm ignition,
and the thrust is go.
You guys are really hauling
the mail out of there.
Boy, you'd better believe it.
It's like we're climbing straight up.
It's a fantastic sight.
Just like we were shot straight up.
Uh, you're going
about 6,000 feet a second.
Their present altitude
is now about 3,000 miles,
and the spacecraft moving at
nearly 35,000 feet per second.
These three crew members...
are traveling faster than
any man has ever flown before.
There's not much
sensation of what's really happening...
except we're looking at the computer and
the computer is adding up the velocity,
and suddenly we really knew
that we were really traveling.
And shoot, when that engine lit off,
it was on for a long time.
Shutdown.
But it really hit us when it stopped,
and we turned around
and looked at the earth.
Suddenly,
the earth had started to shrink.
Hello, Houston. You'd have
to see this planet to believe it.
This is just so you guys
don't get too excited...
and forget what your job is
down there.
We're ready for what
we're about to receive.
Which you could listen to music.
We were allowed to carry a personal
cassette so you could play the music.
Mine was country music.
Hi, this is Buck Owens
from the Buckaroos.
We came down to the studio and thought
we'd put together a little thing...
that you could take along
with you on your trip.
Now when you get back, they're probably
gonna put you in the movies,
so the first thing
we're gonna do for ya...
is to play a little song
called "Act Naturally."
It goes like this:
By the way, you know we're making this
tape and they're going to the moon.
They're on their way
to the moon right now. Oh.
Hey, anybody up there
read me? This is Houston.
You don't think of it
as Texas or the United States.
You really think of it as Earth.
The three things that
I associated with Earth...
were people and green trees
and fresh water.
This is different
for me. My name is Merle Haggard,
and this is my band,
the Strangers.
I hope we will be able to do something
you'll enjoy on your way to the moon.
And of course,
we hope that you come back,
but we want you to leave
this tape there, okay?
We want this tape
to be out of sight.
When you get ready to eat,
they'll say right on there, "Command
Module Pilot, day three, meal two."
So you take that packet out,
and you may have two drinks...
and three or four different
types of food in there.
So you've gotta find a spot to stick
these, or they're gonna float off.
And then you've gotta get
the water gun.
You gotta mix up the drinks
and mix up the food...
and knead 'em around...
and not let everything
float off in the interim.
The only bad part
about zero gravity in Apollo...
was going to the bathroom.
We had a very crude system.
For your feces,
it was a bag,
and you'd put this bag
in the right position.
So you go, but nothing goes to
the bottom of the bag in zero gravity.
Everything floats. So you've
got this bag and then the problem...
is getting it off
and closing up the bag,
making sure everything's
still in the bag.
Are you still planning to have
TV at the scheduled time?
Right. You can go ahead
with the TV now. We're standing by.
Hello, Houston. We've got
a beautiful view of the earth here...
that is absolutely fantastic.
We're standing by
at this time to receive...
the first TV transmission
from the spacecraft.
Houston, we're now
showing you a view of the earth...
through the telephoto lens.
This transmission
is coming to you...
approximately halfway
between the moon and the earth.
It makes you realize
just what you have back there on Earth.
The earth from here is a grand oasis
in the big vastness of space.
I keep imagining if I'm some
lonely traveler from another planet,
would I land on the blue
or the brown part of the earth?
Okay, world.
Hold on to your hat.
I'm gonna turn ya upside down.
The spacecraft
at the present time...
is in a slow roll as part of the passive
thermal control program...
to maintain temperatures.
You have to,
literally, just pinch yourself...
and ask yourself
the question, silently,
"Do you really know where you are
at this point in time and space...
and in reality
and in existence?"
When you look out the window
and you're looking back...
at the most beautiful star
in the heavens...
the most beautiful because
it's the one we understand,
and we know it... it's home, humanity,
people, family, love, life.
And besides that,
it is beautiful.
We can see from pole to pole and
across oceans and continents,
and you can watch it turn
and there's not strings holding it up.
And it's moving in a blackness
that is almost beyond conception.
Rog, how's that tape recorder?
Is the R.P.M. Up to nominal?
Yeah. It works
pretty good here in zero G.
It works better than it does
down there on the ground.
We're ready for the news now.
Okay. Let's see.
The Beatles have announced
they will no longer perform as a group.
The quartet is reported to have made
in excess of a half billion dollars...
during their short
musical career.
Rumors they will use this money to start
their own space program are false.
That's about it for news. A recap
of how the top ten teams did yesterday:
Ohio State beat Purdue,
42 to 14,
Texas beat T.C.U.,
69 to 7.
Tennessee lost to Mississippi.
Final score on that one
was 38 to nothing.
Notre Dame won over Georgia Tech
last night, 38 to 20.
And, of course, Purdue lost
to Ohio State.
When the sunlight shines
through the blackness of space,
it's black,
but I was in sunlight, and I was
able to look at this blackness.
I mean, what are you looking at?
Call it the universe, but it's the
infinity of space and time.
I'm looking at something
called space, that had no end,
and at time,
that has no meaning.
You can really focus on it...
because you got this planet out there...
this star called Earth...
which itself is in this
blackness, but it is lit up...
because the sunlight strikes
on an object...
strikes on something
called Earth.
And it's not a hostile blackness.
Maybe it's not hostile because
the beauty of the earth...
that sort of gives it life.
Throughout the flight,
the times when one could sit back...
and really appreciate what
an amazing adventure this was...
was only during those little
periods of time...
when you had a chance to stop and do
the things you weren’t programmed to do.
A lot of times, when there was
nothing else to do...
or after everybody'd gone
to sleep and I couldn't,
I'd open up the window
and look around.
One thing every spacecraft
ought to have is a huge window.
Looking back at the earth was a pastime
that I never really got tired of.
Uh, who've we got up now?
The other two guys are pretty sleepy.
They sacked out again, so
I'm holding the fort down for a while.
Biomedical data recently was monitored,
and the C.M.P. Was soundly asleep...
while the commander was resting...
but perhaps not soundly asleep.
We got the black watch
watching you tonight.
You picked the midnight shift, I see.
Yeah, it's turning out
to be kind of quiet too.
We like it that way.
When you're out there
in this little command module,
you see the risk you're taking
because you realize...
that, if the glass breaks
or the computers quit working...
or the electrical system
quits working,
you're not gonna get back.
And you have time to contemplate this.
You have time to think about it.
And you have time to run it through
your mind a lot of different times.
How far away from Earth now,
Jim... about?
It looks like you're
approaching 150,000 miles.
Frank, we had a little
eggnog over at Charlie Duke's tonight.
Val Anders dropped by. She's looking
fine. Tell Bill she's doing real well.
Rog, thank you.
Everything that I know...
my family and my possessions,
my friends, my country.
It's all down there
on that little thing,
and it's so insignificant
in this great big vastness of space.
Here in Mission Control,
the coffee cup...
has become an appliance...
second only to the headset...
in usefulness here.
Let's, uh, cycle through
some of our consumables...
and other items this morning,
and I'll tell you what we see.
And all this looks quite nominal.
Lights, camera, action.
We'll show you some of the type
meals that we have on Earth.
Matter of fact, on this flight,
we've carried along pieces of bread.
And along with the bread...
we have a ham spread.
And I'll show you, I hope,
how easy it is...
to spread some ham...
in the environment of zero G.
I think we've discovered
that it is quite easy to...
That's great.
You all ought to set this to music.
Oh, you want music?
This little tape recorder
has been a big benefit to us...
in passing for the time away
in our transit onto the moon.
And it's rather odd to see it
floating like this, in odyssey,
while it's playing...
the theme from 2001.
- We've lost our picture.
- What the...
Okay, Houston.
We've had a problem here.
I got three fuel cell lights,
an A.C. Buss light,
fuel cell disconnect, A.C. Buss overload
one and two, main buss A and B, out.
This is Houston. Say again, please.
Gang, I don't know what happened here.
We had everything in the world
drop out.
We are venting something.
I don't think
this is gonna be a simple problem.
We have an apparent serious problem...
with a leak in the cryogenic
oxygen in the service module...
which provides breathing oxygen
for the crew.
Apollo, Houston.
Try S.C.E. To auxiliary, over.
N.C.E. To auxiliary.
S.C.E. S.C. E to auxiliary.
Okay. Let's make sure
we don't do anything...
that's going to blow our C.S.M.
Electrical power with the batteries...
or that will cause us to lose
fuel cell number two.
On panel 276
under instrumentation and power control,
open C.B. Number three
and number four.
Close ascent feed one and two
circuit breakers.
Cycle the Parker valves, and then open
the S.M.C. Circuit breakers on panel 11.
Hey, it's off. It's off.
That sounds beautiful, troops.
That's exactly
what we wanted to see.
Charlie, my hats off
to the guys in the trench.
I love 'em.
And, by the way,
welcome to the moors sphere.
You're in the influx.
One of the things different
about a lunar trip...
is you don't pass anyplace
on the way.
Going to the moon, you leave the
launchpad, then you leave Earth orbit.
And then a couple of days
later, after passing nothing,
all of a sudden,
you're at the moon.
And that lack of way points, to me,
had an effect of making it seem a little
magical and mystical getting there.
This is really a rugged planet.
We're drawing close to the moon
with the Apollo spacecraft.
Our L.O.S. Clock,
our loss of signal clock,
continues to count down
until that time...
that the spacecraft will pass
out of communications range...
over the backside
of the moon.
On approach, the spacecraft
just sort of dives towards...
and behind the moon.
It was a totally different moon than
any moon I had ever seen before.
It was in this eerie shadow.
No motion. Utterly silent.
It sort of gave one
a feeling of foreboding.
It didn't seem like a very
friendly or welcoming place.
Apollo, this is Houston.
You are go for L.O.I.
Go ahead, Houston.
Jim, you are go for the burn.
Go for the burn.
Okay. Apollo is go.
You're going too fast to orbit
the moon. You're rocking on ready.
Okay. Two minutes, babe.
Give it a final trim.
Burn time is 15 seconds,
so it's gonna go in a hurry.
You're in the burn position.
You're ready to go.
Baby, let's make this one.
- Then there it is.
- Thirty-five seconds.
It's 2001 type stuff.
That old moors just growing
magnificently fast,
and it's just filling up
that hatch window...
and you're drifting
into the shadow.
Okay, baby. Eight, seven, six,
five, three, two, one.
Burn. Burn.
You're burning.
Okay. Seventy-eight to go,
50 to go, 20 to go.
- Standby, Tom.
- Shut down.
Oh, beautiful, beautiful.
Apollo, Houston. You got
the burn off. We're in good shape.
Boy, I tell you.
We is down among them.
We is going backwards.
You know that?
You've worked so long
and so hard, and finally you're here.
The burn has gone well.
You know you're in lunar orbit.
You know the orbit is good.
You're right where you wanted to be.
And it just looked like you
could reach out and touch it.
Apollo now traveling
over the backside of the moon.
The crew should be seeing the features,
the rugged features,
moving below them
at a high rate of speed.
Charlie, we just saw Earth
rise and it's gotta be magnificent.
Charlie, it might sound corny, but
the view is really out-of-this-world.
Dave, you ought to
start getting your hatch closed.
Say again.
Start getting your hatch
closed if you're not already doing it.
I was disappointed.
I wanted to go with them so bad
I could taste it.
As far as I was concerned,
that's what it was all about...
not only going to the moon, but
going down to the surface and walking.
We're now less than two minutes
away from the separation burn,
which will be performed
by the command module.
When we next hear from them,
the lunar module...
should be undocked from
the command and service module.
You'll never know
how big this thing gets...
when there ain't nobody but one guy.
Yeah. Don't get lonesome
out there, John.
I wish I could go down there with 'em.
You may not talk about it much,
but part of your training
is coming back by yourself.
See you later.
I wish the damn thing
would hold three people.
It's grown quiet here
in Mission Control.
A few moments ago,
Flight Director Gene Krantz...
requested that everyone sit down,
get prepared for events that are coming,
and he closed with,
"Good luck to all of you."
We's go and we's down
among 'em, Charlie!
Rog, I hear ya weaving
your way up the freeway.
You're going
right down U.S. 1, Mike.
Rog, copy. Looks great.
Okay, all flight controllers,
go, no go for landing. Retro.
- Go.
- Econ.
- Go.
- Surgeon.
- Go.
- Fido.
- Go.
- Guidance.
- Go.
- Telcom.
- Go.
- G.N.C.
- Go.
- We're go for landing.
Eagle, Houston.
You are go for landing, over.
Okay, Houston.
We'll give you a countdown.
Four, three, two, one. Fire.
Pitch over. There it is. Oh, baby.
We are sure coming down
to that drop. Look at that rille.
That's gotta be, gotta be
probably Diamondback right there.
When the pitch is over
and you get your first look, you know...
there's nothing but nine million
craters out there.
A terrible sinking feeling.
I obviously didn't recognize a thing
after studying all these photographs.
Nothing looked right.
- How you doing, control?
- We look good here. Fine.
- How about you, Telcom?
- Go.
- Guidance, you happy? Fido?
- Go. Go.
You are go.
You're go to continue power descent.
You are go to continue
power descent. Over.
All during this power descent
I kept telling myself,
"This is not for real. You're back in
the simulator. Just remember that."
Eagle, Houston.
It's descent two fuel to monitor, over.
Eagle, Houston.
Everything's looking good here, over.
Houston, I'm getting a little
fluctuation in the A.C. Voltage now.
Roger. Stand by.
Looking good to us.
You're still looking good.
Houston,
you're looking at our delta eight.
That's affirmative.
Looking good to us, over.
Eagle, Houston.
We'll monitor your delta eight.
Six plus two-five throttle
down. Six plus two-five throttle down.
Roger. Copy. Six plus two-five.
Let me try auto again now...
see what happens.
We got data dropout. Roger. Stand by.
We're go on that alarm?
If it doesn't reoccur, we'll be go.
We are go on that alarm.
Roger. I understand. Go for landing.
Roger. We got good data.
Altitude velocity lights.
Eagle, we got you now.
It's looking good, over.
Four forward,
drifting to the right a little.
Coming at us 23, 21 down, 33 degrees.
We're go. Same type. We're go.
- Kicking up dust.
- A couple of big boulders.
Coming right. Got a good spot.
Not too bad. Here comes the shadow.
Oh, are we coming in.
- Stand by for touchdown.
- Stand by.
Bam!
Houston, uh, Tranquility Base here.
The eagle has landed.
There's a cheer in this room.
What we're witnessing now
is mars very first trip into space...
with a station stop
along the route.
We gonna stay, Houston?
Eagle, you are stay for T-1.
This thing came to a stop on the moon.
It was kind of a letdown saying,
"You know, we're gonna have to get it
going fast again to get back home."
Neil, this is Houston.
What's your status on hatch opening?
Okay, Houston. I'm on the porch.
Neil, this is Houston.
Loud and clear by radio.
Check and verify
TV circuit breaker in.
Roger. TV circuit breakers in.
Houston, roger. We copy,
and we're standing by for your T.E.D.
I'm gonna pull it now.
Houston,
the mesa came down all right.
And we're getting a picture on the TV.
Got a good picture, huh?
Okay, Neil. We can see you
coming down the ladder now.
The surface seems to be
very, very fine-grained...
as you get close to it.
I'm at the foot of the ladder.
Okay. I'm gonna step off
the LM now.
That's one small step for man,
one giant leap for mankind.
I had a bet
with somebody who didn't...
Really felt that Neil
spent a great deal of time...
before he went figuring out
his famous words,
and they were not extemporaneous
on the spot historical words.
He actually felt
that these words...
might have even been written
for Neil by somebody else.
And I said,
"Well, I'll bet you 500 bucks...
"that when I get to the bottom
of the ladder...
"nobody ever remembers what the second
person to do something does anyhow...
I'm gonna say,
"It may have been a small step for Neil,
but it's a big step
for a little fella like me."
Are you ready for me to come out?
Okay.
I want to back up
and partially close the hatch,
making sure not to lock it
on my way out.
So this person says,
"Ah, no way you're gonna do that.
They're gonna tell you
what to say."
I said, "Okay, a bet's a bet."
So I bet this person $500,
and when I got to the bottom
of the ladder, I said it.
And that may have been a small one
for Neil, but that's a long one for me.
12 Houston, we have you
in blushing black and white.
What happened to the color?
Maybe the color wheel will come up.
I can feel the wheels running...
because I can feel something
in motion inside.
Why don't you put your glove
in front of the lens?
All right. Will do.
- That's coming in there now.
- Got the ol' camera running.
Okay.
What change did you make?
I hit it on the top with my hammer.
I figured we didn't have
a thing to lose.
I can't believe it.
I want you to watch this.
I don't know
if this'll work or not, Charlie.
Well, in my left hand
I have a feather,
in my right hand, a hammer.
And I guess one of the reasons
we got here today...
was because of a gentleman
named Galileo a long time ago...
who made a rather
significant discovery...
about falling objects
in gravity fields.
And we thought that where
would be a better place...
to confirm his findings
than on the moon?
And so we thought
we'd try it here for ya.
The feather happens to be,
appropriately, a falcon feather,
for our falcon.
And I'll drop
the two of them here,
and, hopefully, they'll hit
the ground at the same time.
How about that?
That proves that Mr. Galileo
was correct in his findings.
We've got a beautiful picture
of you guys up down here.
Let me tell you, Bob. This flag
is a beautiful picture.
Hey, John, this is perfect,
with the LM, you and the ol' flag.
We really should set the flag up
on a hill, Charlie,
but there just ain't one.
I know, John.
I'll put it right here. Big rock.
I was proud for our country
more than I was proud for me.
And it was nothing that I did.
I just happened to have gotten
there at the right time.
My background
carried me through.
But there were a lot of other
qualified people that didn't go.
Why my name came out,
I don't know.
And we very proudly
deploy it on the moon...
to stay for as long
as it can,
in honor of all those people who have
worked so hard to put us here...
and to make the country and mankind
something different than it was.
It was like sitting
in the last row of the balcony,
looking down
at that play going on.
While I was in the play, it was
more like I was a spectator.
Tranquility, this is Houston.
We'd like to say, from all of us
down here in Houston,
and, really, from all of us...
in all the countries
in the entire world,
we think that you've done
a magnificent job up there today, over.
Thank you very much.
Have you had enough TV for today?
Yes, indeed. It's been
a mighty fine presentation there.
Thank you. Couldn’t have enjoyed it
as much as we did.
Get some rest there
and have at it tomorrow.
Okay. Signing off.
See you again tomorrow.
All systems on the lunar module
are in good order.
We have not heard from Tranquility base
since saying good night.
My mind's one that
just goes constantly,
so I took a sleeping pill.
Slept like a baby.
I had one dream
that was very vivid.
In my dream, we were driving
the Rover up to the north.
And you didn't really feel
like you were out there.
It was untouched.
The serenity of it...
had a pristine purity about it.
We crossed a hill.
I felt, "Gosh, I've been here before."
And there was a set of tracks
out in front of us.
So we asked Houston if we could follow
the tracks, and they said yes.
And we turned and followed the tracks.
Within an hour or so
we found this vehicle.
It looked just like the Rover.
The two people in it...
they looked like me and John...
had been there
for thousands of years.
It was not a nightmare-type
situation... nothing like that.
Probably one of the most real
experiences in my life.
I'd have traded
on the drop of a hat...
to go and land on the moon.
I'm one of these nuts.
I like classical music,
and I almost learned
to like country and western.
One of the things I took was Berlioz'
"Symphonie Fantastique,"
which seemed like that was appropriate
to be taking to the moon.
And I was floating along,
just laying back
and enjoying life.
I had just crossed
the face of the moon,
going towards the darkness.
And here's this strange scene,
this music.
And it just seemed to put it
all together in one moment...
that you could completely forget
that this is a real situation.
This is Apollo control Houston...
at 104 hours, 31 minutes
now into this historic mission.
The lunar surface temperature in the sun
should be around 135 degrees today.
In the shade, the temperature
would again be around minus 100...
to minus 150 degrees Fahrenheit.
That would be in the shadow
of the lunar module.
Ah, look at that!
Ah, it's a panoramic scene
of beauty!
Al, can you find the earth?
Oh, there it is. I see it.
Looking at the earth
down there, Houston.
It looks like you're littler
than a golf ball at arm's length now.
Sure looks pretty, though.
Really looks spectacular.
It seemed very unreal to me...
to be there,
looking back at the earth,
thinking how far,
far away it was.
This is the moon.
That is the earth.
I'm really here.
We're allowing about five
minutes for the drive to station three.
Okay. Safety belts on.
And here we go.
How's the driving, John? Pretty easy?
Driving good.
Man, Indie's never seen
a driver like this. Barney Oldfield.
Charlie,
what should we be heading for?
- Those craters up there.
- Don't tell me that.
Boy, this is so neat.
You look like you're headed
just about for our spot.
- See Survey Ridge down there?
- Yep.
This is gonna be spectacular!
No, not through this crater.
- Yeow! Whoa!
- Trying to see if you're nervous.
OI' Barney's really driving this beauty.
Only way to fly, Tony.
This is gonna be such a
spectacular view, you can't believe
it.
Well, that's good news.
We're here! You did it!
Hey, that was a good stop.
Those wheels just locked.
Marked off! Super.
John, did you dust that TV lens?
Get some dirt in your eye, Houston?
That does a good job on the lens there.
You want us to go up
and travel along that ridge?
Yeah, why don't you press on up there?
I think
the best place here for the ALSEP...
is to the LM's
11:00 position.
That sounds good, Charlie.
And, John, it's 2-6-6.
I felt very welcome there.
You know, the moors been waiting for us
for thousands of years...
millions of years, maybe,
unless someone else has already been
there before us at some time.
That's possible,
although we didn't see
any evidence of that.
I felt like I was the only one
there, but not an alien...
not an alien in terms of
invading someone else's domain.
I didn't find the moon hostile.
I found it
very majestically beautiful.
Bland in color,
but majestically beautiful.
There's a look at that
glass-covered one right there.
Pretty good size, isn't it?
It looks like
it's about three days old.
So it must be on the order
of four billion.
So let's fill this one up,
and then...
Ah, rats!
Betcha that looked like
a comedy of errors on the tube.
Yeah.
Hold still.
That is a crystalline rock
if I've ever seen a crystalline rock.
- First one today.
- Yeah.
We gotta get over
this ridge, John.
Do you want to take off
and go that way now?
Yeah.
John, did you make those
little footprints here?
Yeah, I guess I did.
Aah, the old footprints
on the crater rim.
There's a good rock
right there.
Look at the size of that rock!
I thought this thing
was just right next door to us.
Well, Tony, that's
your house rock right there.
It's got black streaks
coming out of it.
This is tough going here.
Let me have the shovel.
I'll get it. Just a minute.
Good deal, boy.
There you go.
I can't get going here.
You've got about ten minutes
left before we have to leave.
- Is that okay for you?
- Yep, sure is.
338 is the soil sample.
That is the best sample we got.
- I know it.
- I'll tell ya.
You just had to steal time now and then.
You just had to stop
chipping at a rock...
and figure out that bringing back
some kind of thought and feeling...
was as important as bringing
another chunk of rock back.
And not being a machine but being
a human being, you have to stop and say,
"Do you know where you are
and what you're looking at?"
And try and take in, in those
few moments of privacy you have,
everything there is to take in
in that moment.
You've got five minutes here.
And all of a sudden,
you've got to get to work.
Okay, Houston,
as I stand out here...
in the wonders
of the unknown at Hadley,
I realize there's a fundamental
truth to our nature:
Man must explore.
One of the things
you gotta stop and do...
is make sure to have fun too.
Because you're only probably
gonna come this way once.
- No, May.
- May.
Boy, is this
a neat way to travel.
Isn't it great?
- I like to skip along.
- Not me, boy. Skip.
Well, whatever you call it.
I can't get my left leg in front of me.
It was almost dangerous.
You lose sight of the fact
that it's a vacuum out there,
and if you spring a leak in that
suit, you're gonna be dead.
Uh-oh.
Nice soft Navy landing.
Yahoo!
Boy, do I like to run up here.
I feel like Bugs Bunny.
This is neat.
Here come the Bobbsey twins.
You're pretty agile there,
twinkle toes.
I'm going out for the ballet
when I get back.
You learn another
line of work up here.
And while you're
bouncing around there,
you might keep your eye out
for a nearby crater.
Ah, rats. I been on my knees
twice to get that.
- John.
- Yes, sir?
You are black
from the knees down.
No way to avoid it. That's why I'm glad
the pressure suit bends.
John, you are filthy.
I'll tell you, that's the pot
calling the kettle black.
Hey, here's a rock they'll
be glad to see in Houston.
Man, Tony, you don't know
how much fun this has been.
We concur, John.
Having gotten away from the spacecraft,
I was able to really realize...
what this place was like
that we had landed in.
I had tried to anticipate
what it would be like for many years,
but it was obvious that there was no way
one could have anticipated...
what it would be like to stand
in the valley of Taurus Litterol,
a place deeper than the Grand Canyon
and equally as spectacular,
and see this brilliantly
illuminated landscape...
with a brighter sun than anyone
had ever stood in before,
with a blacker-than-black sky,
and then to top the whole scene off,
in this blacker-than-black sky...
was a beautiful,
brilliantly illuminated...
blue marble
that we call the earth.
The path of evolution is now
in space as much as on Earth.
Man has shown
that as a species...
mankind was willing
to commit itself...
to living in environments that
were completely different...
than those in which
the species evolved.
We put a shield of life
around ourselves...
in order to protect
the life within,
but the willingness
to go out there is there.
We've shown that.
The curve of human evolution
has been bent.
Okay, it's time to load up right now.
We're on our way again, Tony.
We'd like you to drive
gingerly up to the ALSEP area there.
Okay, we'll go on up.
You want to go right or left?
We want to head...
Just keep going west.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hook a left.
You gotta expect trouble
from backseat drivers.
Okay, we copy that, John.
Look at this baby. I'm really
getting confidence in it now.
This back wheel's off the ground.
Charlie, whatever you do,
don't hit that brake.
The Grand Prix drivers are at it again.
This is about the neatest
thing I ever saw.
It's back to the LM,
right, Tony?
You bet your life.
And you're well ahead
on the time line.
We must've forgotten
something. That's all I can say.
Well, everything's running.
We're just about to start
upslope here.
Have we been climbing, John?
Look at that pitch meter.
It's pegged out high.
Yeah, we have been climbing.
Tony, we've really...
It doesn't feel like we're climbing, but
we've been climbing for a while here.
We're going up a steep, steep
slope, John. I'll tell you.
Look at that, Charlie.
I don't see. What? What?
Well, I'll be doggoned.
Look at that!
You said you were gonna see
some other tracks on the moon.
I knew it.
We're going back down
our tracks, Tony.
Okay, good show.
There she is, John.
Somebody up there likes us.
Don't run into our home.
I felt like I was an alien
as I travelled through space.
But when I got on the moon,
I didn't feel that at all.
I felt at home there, even though
the earth was a long ways away.
We could see it directly above,
about the size of a marble...
and realize that we were there
but by the grace of God.
I felt like I was at the end
of a thin cord...
that could be cut
at any time.
It was precarious,
but yet I felt comfortable.
I felt something other than
what we can visually sense.
A spiritual presence was there.
Perhaps it was because so many people on
the earth were focusing their attention.
They were maybe sending signals
to us somehow.
I sensed,
I guess in a way,
much like maybe the first man
on the earth would have sensed...
like Adam or perhaps Eve...
as they were standing on the earth
and they realized they were all alone.
There was no one else
on the earth,
but yet they had
that special communication.
And I guess it was similar
to the feeling I had...
when I realized
that Dave Scott and I...
were the only two
on this vast planet.
Another world.
We were the only two there.
We felt an unseen love.
We were not alone.
Hi, big guy.
Hi there, Charlie.
Bob, this is Gene,
and I'm on the surface.
And as I take mars
last step from the surface,
in everlasting commemoration...
of what the real meaning
of Apollo is to the world,
we'd like to uncover a plaque...
that has been on the leg
of our spacecraft...
that we have climbed down
many times over the last three days.
The words are...
"Here man completed his first
exploration of the moon.
"May the spirit of peace
in which we came...
"be reflected in the lives...
of all mankind."
Some 7 minutes,
22 seconds away from ignition...
on the LM ascent
back into lunar orbit.
- Capcom.
- Go.
- Surgeon.
- Go.
- G and C.
- Go.
- Fido.
- Go.
AFD. Oh, we don't have
an AFD. FAO?
Network. Recovery.
Capcom, we're go for liftoff.
Tranquility Base, Houston.
You're cleared for takeoff.
Roger. Understand.
We're number one on the runway.
The moon is different.
It's become mars first outpost,
our first footstep in space.
Where man was able to look back
at the earth and see the earth,
and see himself
in a different perspective.
Six, five, four,
three, two, one, ignition.
As you leave, you're leaving
this unbelievably beautiful...
naked charcoal ball
out there in space.
And you've been around the moon.
You've been on it.
You're seeing something
that's familiar to you.
That's home.
That's where we lived.
There's where we left
the lunar rover.
There's the mountains
and the valleys.
It has, in a sense, been a home,
a life-sustaining home for you.
And when you leave it
and you see those things,
you leave it with the same kind
of feeling and awe...
that you left the earth with
several days earlier.
When we were about 30 minutes
from rendezvous with the module,
Pete said to me,
"You want to fly this thing?"
And I said,
"Well, yeah, I'd like to fly."
As I took the controls,
I said, "Wait a minute.
The people on Earth in Mission
Control aren't gonna like this."
And to show how he thinks
about things, he said,
"Don't worry. We're on the back side
of the moon. They'll never know."
Houston. You're looking good.
Roger, Houston.
We are returning to the earth. Over.
Glad to have you
on the way back home.
I think I must have the feeling...
that the travelers on the old
sailing ships used to have.
You've gone on a very long
voyage away from home,
and now we're headed back.
I have that feeling of being
proud of the trip...
but still happy to be going back
home and back to our home port.
We set sail on this new sea...
because there is new knowledge
to be gained...
and new rights to be won,
and they must be won and used
for the progress of all mankind.
As time goes on, I truly believe
that you are able to pull out
of the subconscious...
a great many things
that you absorbed...
in those moments while you were
there looking back at the earth.
And I can almost transform
my body, certainly my mind,
through time and space instantaneously
to that spot on the moon.
I know where I am
when I look at the moon.
It's not just some abstract,
romantic idea.
It's something very real to me.
The stars are my home.
