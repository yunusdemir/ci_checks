Oh, yeah.
<i>How did you meet Rebecca?</i>
I met Rebecca in school after
I'd moved back and went to Indian Hills.
Um, I went there
'cause I had a lot of absences.
I didn't want to go to school. I had
a lot of self-loathing and anxiety issues.
- I thought that I was ugly.
- You're not ugly.
I know I'm not ugly. I just-
I don't know. I never saw myself
as an A-list-looking guy.
Um, but I went to Indian Hills
to learn and be with my peers.
But I was always self-conscious that I wasn't,
you know, as good-looking as other people.
Want a ride?
Hey, where we going?
Wherever we want.
<i>Okay. -</i>
Do you know anybody that's out of town?
Um-
Yeah, this kid Evan.
His family went to Jamaica. Why?
I went into an unlocked house
a few weeks ago...
- found a bunch of cash.
- Oh, shit.
- Where does Evan live?
- Woodland Hills.
How well do you know Evan?
I mean, we met up a few times.
He's pretty hot.
It's a nice place.
Fuck. We need to get out of here.
It's fine. Don't freak out.
It's a Birkin.
Great.
Lindsay has this one.
I think we need to get out of here.
Oh, yeah.
What is it?
No way.

I got them on the way out.
How long's Evan in Jamaica?
This is so cute.
Yeah.

<i>I loved her.</i>
<i>I really did.</i>
<i>She was the first person
I felt like was my best friend.</i>
<i>I loved her almost like a sister.</i>
<i>That's what made this situation so hard.</i>
Okay, this morning's lesson
is on character development.
So in The Secret,
we talk about the law of attraction...
and how we need to be really careful about
who we surround ourselves with...
because we wind up being
the average of those people.
So we are going to make vision boards...
about people who are demonstrating
good character...
like Angelina Jolie.
So, what qualities do you guys
admire about Angelina Jolie?
Her husband.
Mm-hmm. Okay.
- Anything else?
- Her hot bod.
Okay. Okay.
Well, the hot bod is not a characteristic.
- But-Okay?
- How long do we have to do this for?
Well, we're gonna do it until we finish...
and then we're gonna move on
to the ﬂuorescence work.
Got it.
<i>Okay. -</i>

Let's go there.
Do you think we could find a way in?
Uh, looks like you get in
going up this hill by her house.
I bet she'd leave her keys under her mat.
Awesome!
Oh, my fucking gosh!
It's her pet monkey. Hi, little guy.
Okay. Come on.
Holy shit.

Try this with it.
Yes!
What do you think?
Try it with your hair back.
Oh, yeah. That looks classy.
I wouldn't go that far.
- Leopard and zebra?
- What?
Yeah, you can't have leopard and zebra.
You gotta choose one.
Okay, fine. Whatever.
At least I don't look like I'm 35.
- Oh! Damn.
- Harsh.
Come on. Let's go to Paris's.
I want to rob.
<i>I didn't know what they were doing.</i>
I thought they were my friends.
It all comes back to, like, bad choices...
who you have as your friends.
And I know the truth will come out.
See? Look.
Okay. So, these are her sunglasses,
and that's her bathroom...

- Oh, my God.</i>
<i>Audrina Patridge posted
this security footage on her Web site.</i>
Shit.
<i>She's asking anyone who has information
about the break-in...</i>
<i>to contact police at the number below.</i>
<i>It's fine. You can't see who it is.</i>
- Shit. Fuck. One second, Rebecca.
- Just chill out.
I can't talk.
- Everything all right in here?
- Yes, Mr. Hall.
We're sorry for making too much noise.
Everything's fine, Dad.
All right.
You're stressing me out.
Carly keeps texting me.
It's so annoying.
Ew!! She's so grimy.
I know.
I think I'm gonna go to Sagebrush later.
Cool. Who's playing?
I don't know. A couple local bands.
I want to go to Rachel Bilson's.
She's in Paris for fashion week.
Don't you think you should
chill out a little bit?
Yeah. That news thing
totally freaked me out.
Nothing happened.
There's no way of telling who it is anyway.
Come on.
Can you find her house for me, please?
I want some Chanel.
- I don't know.
- Come on. You're my best friend.
Please? Let's go get some stuff.
We're going to Rachel Bilson's.
Wanna come?
<i>Hells yeah. Text me where.</i>
<i>Is she still dating Hayden Christensen?</i>
I don't know.
Marc thinks so.
Come on.
<i>I think the biggest problem was
after the Audrina thing, nothing happened.</i>
<i>It gave Rebecca that self-boast that,
“Oh, this is okay. I can get away with this.”</i>
<i>And I think her projecting that onto me
made me think that it was gonna be okay.</i>
- Yo, Becca.
- Hey. What's up?
I heard you went to Paris Hilton's.
- Yeah.
- And you took some stuff?
- Yeah.
- Oh, that's so cool. Paris Hilton.
We're gonna go get a drink. Lates.
I can't believe she went to
Paris Hilton's house.
What up?
Where have you guys been tonight?
- We went to Rachel Bilson's.
- No fucking way!
- Yeah. It was chill.
- Sick!
You went to Rachel Bilson's?
- Yeah. She's in Paris at fashion week.
- Shut the fuck up.
We just went in.
Yeah, look at their chill-ass
Chanel purses, dude.
What the fuck are you doing? Come on.
- Come on now.
- Puff, puff, pass.
Puff, puff, puff.
<i>Rebecca's, like, biggest conquest
was Lindsay Lohan.</i>
<i>She was her ultimate fashion icon.</i>
<i>Lindsay Lohan is
fighting back against accusations...</i>
<i>she stole a $2,500 necklace
from a Southern California jewelry store.</i>
<i>Her attorney addressed
the matter for the first time.</i>
This is the dress she wore
to the Cosmopolitan opening.
Oh, my God. Let me see it.
I want to try it on. it's amazing.
These are cute. These are really useful.
Yeah.
When are you coming back from Vegas?
I don't know. Just gonna stay with my dad
until things calm down with my mom.
- <i>I'll</i> call you from there?
- Okay.
Will you hold on to
some of my stuff for me?
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay. Bye.
Bye.
Ciao.
<i>Why do you think Rebecca was so obsessed
with these women and their clothes-</i>
<i>enough to steal?</i>
<i>I just think she wanted to be
a part of, like, the lifestyle.</i>
<i>Like, the lifestyle
that everybody kind of wants.</i>
Lindsay Lohan gave police
the security footage...
from the night of March 23,
when her house was burglarized.
Comparing the clips...
it looks like these are the same burglars...
as in the Audrina Patridge security video...
and police are investigating
the connection...
of the Hollywood Hills burglaries.
If you have any information,
please contact the LAPD.
<i>Marc and Rebecca were
bragging about it at a party.</i>
<i>They said they had been in Rachel Bilson's
house and Lindsay Lohan's.</i>
<i>They said they went to Paris Hilton's,
like, eight times.</i>
<i>That's Marc Hall, Rebecca Ahn and Chloe.
I don't know her last name. And Nicki Moore.</i>
LAPD. Open the door!
- Is this the home of Marc Hall?
- Yes.
- We have a search warrant.
- <i>I'll-I'll</i> get him.
Marc.
Mom.
Okay. Whatever it is,
we'll figure it out. it's gonna be okay.
Ma'am.
You have the right
to remain silent. Understand?
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.
What's going on here?
What's this all about?
- Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to step aside.
- Honey.
You have the right to speak to an attorney
present during any questioning, okay?
And if you cannot afford a lawyer,
one will be provided for you.
All right? Let's go.
- Marc. Over here.
- Marc, right over here!
- Right here, buddy.
- Hey, Marc. Right here.
Los Angeles Police.
- Yes?
- Ma'am, we're the police.
- Is this the home of Nicolette Moore?
- Yes.
We have a search warrant to search the house.
Ma'am, can you please step out of the way?
- Out of the way.
- For what?
- Is anyone else in the house, ma'am?
- Mom?
- My kids.
- Call them downstairs.
- What's going on?
- Come downstairs, you guys.
Come downstairs right now.
- What's going on?
- Where are they going?
Ma'am, you need to secure
your animal-now.
Pick up your dog.
Ma'am, you have any weapons in the house?
- No.
- Okay.
What is this about?
Wait. What is going on?
<i>I'll</i> explain everything to you
before we're done. Nicolette?
- Yeah.
- Sit down over there.
- Why?
- What did I do?
Just sit down.
- Just sit down.
- Why?
We're conducting an investigation.
Before we're done...
I promise you <i>I'll</i> explain everything.
- Why do I have to sit down?
- Zip it.
- Put your hands behind your back.
- Mom?
- Mom? Mom?
- Excuse me. Sorry.
- Excuse me.
- Get her back.
- Can you stop-
- I need you to stop right here.
- I need to speak to my mom.
- ...what you're doing with my daughter.
I need to speak to my mom. Mom?
- Call the lawyer. Call a lawyer!
- Mom, why are they taking her?
You're hurting me.
You're really hurting me. Mom.
Can you call the-Ow!
Ow. I want to talk to my mom.
Ow. Ow.
- Hello? How can I help you?
- Ls this the home of Rebecca Ahn?
I'm her mother,
but she's staying with her father in Nevada.
Easy, Tank.
What the fuck, man?
Chloe.
- Carrot-beet?
- No.
Crystal, shh! Crystal.
Crystal. Chloe.
Then Rebecca wanted
to go to Orlando Bloom's.
We knew he was away, from the Internet.
You know, you Google his name...
and it says Orlando Bloom's shooting a movie
in New York, and he's with Miranda Kerr.
So we just walked in.
The door was unlocked. There was no alarm.
The door was unlocked?
I'm really sorry about what I did.
Did you know Rebecca
was leaving the state?
L- I just knew that she was
going to stay at her dad's...
because she wasn't getting along
with her mom and her step dad.
You didn't know she was taking
stolen property...
across state lines
and leaving you holding the bag?
I thought she was just
gonna go see her dad.
- Metro Police. Are you Rebecca Ahn?
- Yes.
We have a warrant to search
the premises. Step aside.
Move back.
Bobby. Downstairs.
Jeff, upstairs. See what you find.
Here's your warrant.
Do you know why we're in your home,
serving you a search warrant?
- Yes.
- Why do you think we're here?
My friend Marc was arrested.
He called me from jail...
and said the police had done
a search warrant on his home.
- Do you know why?
- I've been watching <i>TMZ.</i>
They've been saying I'm a person of interest
in these burglaries.
Were you involved in these burglaries
of these celebrities?
No, I wasn't.
Is there going to be any property
from those burglaries in this residence?
- No.
- Have you ever been...
to these celebrity homes
that were burglarized?
No.
Could any of your fingerprints or DNA
be found in any of the victims' homes?
No.
You boys having fun?
Find something interesting? What?
- Yeah, we got a few things on the list.
- Right on.
Anything else?
- Yeah, we also came up with these.
- Nice.
We found a jacket and jeans
that match a description by Lohan...
and some personal photographs
of Paris Hilton.
If I tell you where everything is,
would you let me go?
Hypothetically, let's say I can help you
locate this property...
and tell you who has it,
how would that help me?
<i>Rebecca Ahn, thought
to be the ringleader, was arrested...</i>
<i>and awaits her hearing
with the other members.</i>
Stay tuned for the latest on the Bling Ring.
Did you speak to any of the victims?
I've spoken to all the victims.
Really? What did Lindsay say?
- Nicki. Nicki.
- Nicki. Nicki.
- How was it in there?
- It was not good.
Okay, thank you.
Nicki. Kate from Vanity Fair is here.
Can I get you something to drink?
So how is Sam related?
- We have adopted her.
- I was friends with her mother.
- Mom, this is my interview.
- Okay.
Yeah. So, she has been living with us.
Um, we met when my parents divorced...
and now my mom home schools all of us.
<i>Based on the philosophy of The Secret...</i>
which is based on the laws of attraction.
- Can I talk, please?
- Sure.
I'm sorry.
The reason that we related so well...
is that my dad is a recovering alcoholic...
- and Sam's mom-
- She's a practicing-
is a practicing drug addict and alcoholic.
And our moms became, like, best friends.
- We were, and she went off the deep end.
- Please!
- So, basically you took her in.
- Yes.
We took her in about six years ago.
But let's, uh-
Let's-Let's get back to Nicki, okay?
Uh, so Adam here told me
that you do charity work.
Yes. We do a lot of stuff
through our church.
- Mm-hmm.
- It's called the Agape Church.
- Right.
- It's the religious science philosophy...
<i>beneath The Secret.</i>
Um, my other sister, Gabby,
is on a trip with them building homes.
And they do a yearly trip to Africa...
where they build wells and schools for kids.
Which country?
Um, I can't remember exactly
which country...
but we do bake sales and, like, feeding
the homeless and that kind of stuff.
Okay. So there's a little bit
of a disconnect...
between your positive pursuits
and what's happening now.
Nicki, I don't want you
to answer that comment.
Well, I think that I am-
Don't.
I have, like,
a good statement to say about this.
She could speak generally.
I think this situation
was attracted into my life...
as a huge learning lesson for me...
to grow and expand
as a spiritual human being.
I believe that I am an old soul.
You are, honey. She is.
We've gotten to know Nicki and her family...
and we believe that she is an extremely
focused and honest young woman...
who has a lot to offer the community.
And we agree that there
has not been a disconnect-
that there were circumstances
that happened...
but Nicki herself
has continued to stay on her plane...
despite the tumultuous
experiences happening.
What's your goal,
or life plan, if you have one?
I do. I think it's my journey...
to push for peace
and the health of the planet.
Nicki's expressed to me
a lot of her humanitarianism.
It's my main goal.
I... want to be a leader...
and do things that people really notice.
That's why I'm taking business-
so that I can be a leader...
and-and take a stand for people.
But I went to Indian Hills
to learn and be with my peers...
but I was always self-conscious that I wasn't,
you know, as good-looking as other people.
And now you're a star.
Yeah-On my Facebook page recently...
I had over 800 friend requests.
I accepted them all.
I mean, I didn't even look at them.
And then I noticed someone
had created a fan page for me.
It's just kind of awkward
that so many people are loving me...
for-for something
that's so looked down on in society.
If it had been, you know, something that
were to benefit the community...
or something like that, I'd love it.
But it's kind of showing America has this-
this sick fascination
with a Bonnie and Clyde kind of thing.
Does this look good?
Is this conservative?
If you like a secretary-style hooker.
Bite me.
Maybe with a jacket?
Well, it looks better.
Right?
Ah, you need lower heels.
Yeah.
Where are my kitten heels?
You're so lucky
you weren't on that video.
I know. Sucks.
Yeah. It does.
Maybe I need to wear something longer.
Do you own anything longer?
No.
Mom does.
- Can I have a five-milligram Adderall?
- Mm-hmm.
Okay, just remember what
we went over with Shannon.
They can't prove that you were
in any of those houses, okay?
- I know, Mom.
- All right?
Do you want to just ground ourselves
really quick? Nicki?
I know there is one mind,
one presence and one power.
- Mom, shouldn't we go?
- Emily.
What?
- Stop talking.
- She's praying.
I know I'm always protected,
and karma cleanses my journey.
Thank you, Lord, so much for this truth.
- And so it is.
- And so it is.
So it is. And you rock, girl. Okay?
Right here. Right here. Nicki. Nicki.
- Okay, Nicki.
- Hey, Nicki. Can we get a comment? Nicki.
Nicki.
- Nicki.
- Nicki.
Nicki.
This has been a very difficult time
for myself and my family.
Thank you for respecting my privacy.
I look forward to my day in court.
Chloe!
- Marc.
- Marc.
Right here. Right here.
Hey, Marc.
How does it feel to be a rat?
<i>Okay. -</i>
Remain seated. Come to order.
Division 31 is now in session. The Honorable
Judge Patricia Henley presiding.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Are all parties ready?

<i>Members of the Bling Ring
were sentenced today...</i>
<i>for their role in a rash of break-ins...</i>
<i>that netted more than
three million in high-end goods.</i>
We're here with Nicki Moore...
who just served 30 days for her
involvement in the Bling Ring...
and shared a cell block
with one of its victims, Lindsay Lohan.
There were reports that Lindsay was crying.
With you being next to her,
did you actually hear any of this?
Yeah. I could hear her
crying the first day...
which is really hard
when you're just trying to be strong.
But I just really kept to myself...
and just tried to get through the day.
It's hard when you're
woken up at, like, 5:30.
And how'd she look?
She got to keep her extensions in.
A lot of the girls were talking-
“Oh, I had to take my weave out,” or whatever.
But, um, she was in orange like all of us.
Now, were you nervous being next to her?
Because you actually were accused
of being a part of the group...
that allegedly robbed her house.
Yeah. I mean, it was scary for me.
They were showing the surveillance video.
They were showing the story on TVs inside...
and, you know, little do people know...
that when that first video came out...
I was actually in contact
with her manager...
to tell her who I believed
the people were who robbed her house.
I mean, when I get to tell
my side of this story...
people are gonna know the truth.
So, that's nerve-racking.
She could think you robbed her house.
Yeah. She could have.
But, you know, anyway...
you can follow everything about me
and my journey...
