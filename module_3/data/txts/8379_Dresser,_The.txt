German aircraft carried
out a number of attacks
on Great Britain last night.
The raids, which lasted
for several hours,
were scattered over many
parts of the country
and enemy aircraft have
been reported over towns...
...on the south coast,
the west of england,
the north of england
and the northwest
as well as over the London area.
He does nothing but cry.
- Are they keeping him in?
- They wouldn't let me stay.
Doctor said I seemed
to make matters worse.
I should never have
taken him to the hospital.
I don't know what came over me.
I should have brought him
back here where he belongs.
Why is his coat on the floor?
And his hat?
Drying out. They're wet through.
Well, how did he come to be
in such a state, Norman?
When you telephoned,
I thought at first that he'd
been hurt in the air raid.
- Oh, no.
- Or had an accident.
Oh, no, not an accident.
No, I know, because they...
They said there was no sign
of physical injury.
Your ladyship...
- He's in a state of collapse.
- Yes, I know.
- Well how did he get like that?
- Your...Your ladyship...
What happened to him?
Sit down. Please, sit down.
We must remain calm.
The doctor said it must have
been coming on for weeks.
Oh, if not longer.
Well, I didn't see him
this morning.
He left the digs before I woke.
Where was he all day?
Where did you find him?
Well, what happened
was this, your ladyship.
After the last
all clear sounded,
I went into market square,
just as dusk was coming on,
peculiar light.
Ever so yellowish.
I'd hoped to find
a packet or two of brown
and polson's cornflour,
since our supplies
are rather low.
So I was asking at this stall
and that's when
i heard his voice.
- Whose voice?
- Sir's, of course.
He was taking off his overcoat
in this weather.
"God help the man
who stops me!" He shouted,
and then he threw
the coat to the ground,
just like king lear
in the storm scene.
Look at it. I don't know
that I'll ever get it clean.
And he was so proud of it.
Do you remember?
Oh, no, perhaps it was
before your time.
Mm...First Canadian tour.
Toronto.
What happened after
he took off his coat?
He started on the hat.
Dunn's hat shop, piccadilly,
only a year ago.
Down on the coat it went,
and he jumped on it.
He stamped on his hat,
viciously stamped on his hat.
Well, you can see.
Then he lifted
his arms in the air,
like he does to convey
sterility into goneril's womb.
"How much further
do you want me to go?" And...
His fingers were all of
a fidget, undoing his jacket,
loosening his collar and tie,
tearing at the buttons
of his shirt.
Were there many people about?
A small crowd.
Well, that's why I ran to him.
I didn't want him to stand
there, looking ridiculous,
people were all around,
sniggering.
Did he see you?
Did he know who you were?
I didn't wait to find out.
I just took his hand
and I said, "good evening, sir.
"Shouldn't we be getting
to the theater?"
In my best nanny voice, the one
i use when he's being wayward.
He paid no attention.
He was shivering.
You shouldn't have let the
public see him like that.
It's easy to be wise
after the event,
if you don't mind my saying so,
your ladyship.
But I tried to spirit him away,
not easy with a man
of his proportions,
- only just then...
...a woman approached,
quite old,
wearing bombazine
under a tweed coat,
but perfectly respectable.
She'd picked up his clothes
and wanted to help him dress,
and sir said to the lady...
..."thank you, my dear,
but Norman usually helps me.
"I'd be lost without Norman",
and I thought, "well,
this is your cue, ducky,"
so I said, "I'm Norman,
I'm his dresser,"
and the woman, she had
her hair in curlers,
she took his hand
and she kissed it,
and she said, "you was lovely
in the corsican brothers"...
...and he looked at her
for a long time
and then he smiled sweetly.
You know the way he does
when he's wanting to charm.
"Thank you, my dear,
but you must excuse me.
"I have to make an exit",
and he ran off.
He said,
"i have to make an exit"?
Well, of course, I followed
him, fearing the worst.
I didn't know
he could run so fast.
I just followed this trail
of discarded clothing,
the jacket, the waistcoat,
and I thought,
"we can't have sir doing
"a striptease round town."
And then I found him leaning
up against a lamppost,
weeping.
Where?
Outside the kardomah.
Without a word, hardly
knowing what I was doing,
I led him to the hospital.
The sister didn't recognize him,
although later she said she'd
seen him last night as othello.
A doctor was summoned,
short, bald, bespectacled,
and I was excluded
by the drawing of screens.
And then you telephoned me.
No, I waited, I lurked,
as Edgar says,
and I heard the doctor whisper,
"this man is exhausted.
"This man is
in a state of collapse."
And that's how it happened.
Oh, he did nothing but cry.
Yes, you said.
I left him lying on top of
the bed, still in his clothes,
crying, no, weeping,
as though he'd lost control,
had no choice,
wept and wept, floodgates.
What are we to do?
In an hour, there will be
an audience in this theater
hoping to see him as king lear.
What am I to do?
Well, don't upset yourself,
for a start.
Well, I've never
had to make this sort of
decision before.
Any sort of decision before.
As soon as I came out of the
hospital, I telephoned madge
and asked her to meet me here
as soon as possible.
She'll know what to do.
Oh, yes,
madge will know what to do.
She won't upset herself,
that's for certain.
No, madge will be
ever so sensible.
Well, I suppose
stage managers have to be.
I had a friend once,
had been a vicar
before falling from the pulpit
and landing on the stage.
Ever so good as an ugly sister.
To the manner born.
His wife didn't upset easily.
Just as well, I suppose,
all things considered.
Madge reminds me of her.
Cold, businesslike, boring.
The doctor took me
into a little room
littered with enamel dishes
full of bloodstained bandages.
The smell made me faint.
He asked me about his behaviour
in recent days.
Had I noticed anything untoward?
And what did you say,
if you don't mind my asking?
- I lied.
- Oh.
I said he'd been
perfectly normal.
I don't want to
appear neglectful.
I should have been
more vigilant.
Only last night I woke.
Is that madge?
No, it's Irene.
You were saying,
last night you woke.
- He was looking at me.
He was naked.
It was bitter cold.
He was shivering.
He said, "thank you
for watching over me.
"But don't worry.
Just go on looking after me.
"I have the feeling
i may do something violent."
Talk about untoward.
Glad you didn't tell
the doctors that.
They'd have locked him up
for good.
Last night, after othello,
he asked me, "what do we
play tomorrow, Norman?"
I told him king lear
and he said,
"then I shall wake
"with the storm
clouds over my head."
Oh, I should have made him rest.
The doctor said he'd come
to the end of his rope
and found it frayed.
So would anyone
who'd had to put up with
what he's had to put up with.
You should have told the doctor
about the troubles.
No. Civilians never understand.
I could kick myself for
taking him to the hospital.
It was the right thing to do.
Well, I hope so.
Doctors.
Can you imagine trying
to explain to a doctor
what sir's been through?
"Well, you see, doctor, he's
been trying to recruit actors
"for his Shakespeare company,
"and all the able-bodied and
best ones are in uniform,
"and the theaters are bombed
as soon as you book them."
Doctors.
He'd have had
his hypodermic rampant
before you could say
"as you like it".
Madge is right.
There is no alternative.
We'll have to cancel.
Oh, no. Oh, your ladyship, no.
Cancellation's ever so drastic.
He's ill. There's no crime
in being ill.
It's not high treason,
it's not a capital offence,
it's not desertion
in the face of the enemy.
He's not himself. He can't work.
Will the world stop turning?
Will the Nazis overrun england?
One lear more or less in the
world won't make any difference.
But sir always believes it will.
Oh, who really
cares whether he acts or not?
I never imagined that
it would end like this.
I've always thought
he was indestructible.
All the years
we've been together.
Feels like a lifetime.
Even longer, he and I.
It'll be the first time
we've ever cancelled.
Look, I want to go
to the hospital.
No, Norman.
I want to sit with him
and be with him
and try to give him
some comfort.
I can usually make him smile.
Maybe when he sees me...
They wouldn't even let me stay.
I wish I could remember
the name of the girl
who got me into all this.
Motherly type she was,
small parts, play as cast.
I can see her face clearly.
I can see her standing there
on platform 2
at crewe, a Sunday.
I was on platform 4.
"Norman!" She called.
We'd been together in outward
bound, the number three tour.
Helped with the wardrobe,
i did,
and understudied
scrubby the steward.
That's all aboard a ship,
you know. It was a lovely first
act.
"We're all dead,
aren't we?"
And I say, "yes, sir,
we're all dead. Quite dead."
And he says, "how long have you
been...Have you been...
"Oh, you know." "Me?
"Oh.
"I was lost young."
And then he says, "where...
Where are we sailing for?"
And I say, "heaven, sir.
"And hell, too.
"It's the same place, you see."
Lovely.
Well, to cut
a short story shorter,
sir wanted help in the wardrobe
and someone to assist generally,
but mainly
with the storm in lear.
I've told you this before,
haven't I?
Put me on the timpani, he did.
And on the first night,
after the storm,
while he was waiting to go on
for "no, they cannot
touch me for coining",
he called me over.
My knees were jelly.
"Were you on
the timpani tonight?"
I said, "yes, sir,"
fearing the worst.
"Thank you," he said.
"You are an artist."
My father was exactly the same.
Always exaggerated
his illnesses.
That's why I thought
it was not very serious.
I-i thought...
Any further developments?
Better see the theater manager.
Perhaps you ought
to come with me.
Oh, no, your ladyship,
please, let's take our time.
- Let's not rush things.
- There's no alternative.
Madge is right. We can't play
king lear without the king.
We have to make a decision.
Forgive me,
your ladyship,
it's not a decision
you have to make.
It's the right decision.
I had a friend,
in a very low state he was,
ever so fragile,
a pain to be with.
You weren't safe from him
on top of a bus.
If he happened
to sit beside you,
he'd tell you
the abc of unhappiness
between request stops.
Someone close to him,
his mother, I believe,
although it was never proved,
understandably upset,
made a decision.
A little rest, she said,
with others
similarly off centre,
in colwyn bay,
never a good date,
not in February,
wrapped in a gray rug,
gazing at a gray sea.
Talk about bleak.
Mother dear made a decision,
but it was the wrong decision
and my friend never acted again.
We have to face the facts.
Well, I've never done that
in my life, your ladyship,
and I don't see
why I should start now.
I just like things to be lovely.
Yes, but things
aren't lovely, Norman.
They aren't if you face facts.
Face the facts? It's facing
the company I worry about.
I'll be in madge's office
if I'm wanted.
Well, don't decide yet,
your ladyship.
Let me go to the hospital.
Let me see how he is.
You never know!
I do know.
I realize now that I've
witnessed a slow running down.
I've heard the hiss
of air escaping.
- Norman! Norman!
- Oh!
Good evening, sir.
Good evening, Norman.
Good evening, pussy.
Bonzo,
why are you here?
Well, my name is on the door.
Did the doctors say
you could leave?
Doctors? Huh! Executioners.
Do you know what he told me?
A short, bald butcher.
Il duce in a white coat.
When a doctor tells you
you need rest,
you can be certain
he has not the slightest idea
of what is wrong with you.
I discharged myself.
Telephone the hospital.
Do not telephone
the hospital!
Norman, will you
leave us, please?
I'll see madge and tell her
there is an alternative.
Shh. Shh.
You're fit for nothing.
Please, pussy, don't.
- Cancel the performance.
- Can't, mustn't. Won't.
- Then take the consequences.
- When have I not?
Where have you been all day?
Don't tell me you found
a brothel in this town.
I can't remember all I've done.
I know towards the evening
i was being pursued,
but I couldn't see
who the villains were.
Then the air-raid warning went.
I refused to take shelter.
Wherever I went, I seemed
to hear a woman...
Crying.
Then, suddenly, I had a clear
image of my father on the beach
near lowestoft.
"An actor?" He said, "never!
"You will be a boat
builder like me."
But I defied him
and lost his love.
Father preferred
people to cower.
But I had to chart
my own course.
I decide when I'm ready
for the scrapyard.
Not you. I.
No-one else. I.
The woman you heard crying
was me.
- Norman!
- Sir?
- I want you by me, Norman.
- Yes, sir.
- Don't leave my side, Norman.
- No, sir.
I shall need help, Norman.
Madge.
Oh, you speak to him. He doesn't
listen to a word I say.
- He's obviously incapable.
- You look exhausted.
Oh, well, now,
that's what I call tact.
Are you sure you're able
to go on tonight?
How long have you been with me?
Longer than anyone else.
Have I ever missed
a performance?
No, but then
you've never been ill.
I only want
what's best for you.
What's best for sir is that
he's allowed to get ready.
Ready, yes, I must get ready.
Ready for what?
If you'll excuse me,
your ladyship,
shouldn't you be
getting ready too?
I can't bear
to see him like that.
Then best to leave us.
I've had experience
of these things.
I know what has to be done.
Imagine waking to that
night after night.
Right. Shall we begin at the
beginning? Good evening, sir.
Good evening, Norman.
And how are you
this evening, sir?
A little tearful, I'm afraid,
and you, Norman?
Oh, I'm very well.
Thank you.
I've had ever such a quiet day,
just, er...
Ironing your costumes,
and cleaning your wig
and beard, washing your undies.
And what have you been up to,
sir, if I may ask?
Oh, I've been jumping
on my hat, Norman.
Have you? Ha-ha-ha! Well,
that's an odd thing to do.
May one ask why?
Why what, Norman?
Why have we been jumping
on our hat, sir?
Shall we play...I-spy?
I spy, with my little eye,
something beginning with...
...a.
Now, I know you won't guess
so I'll tell you.
A is for actor...
...and actors have to work,
and actors have to put on their
make-up and change their frocks
and then, of course,
actors have to act.
Good lord!
Zounds! Madam, where dost thou
get this knowledge?
From a baboon, sir,
that wandered wild in Eden.
Or words to that effect.
There's less than an hour to
go, and you usually want more.
So, come on.
Shall we make a start?
Yes, it's me, Norman.
The one with the soulful eyes.
There.
Come on. Drink up.
It's tea, not rat poison.
Aye. Have a little.
There. There you go.
That's better, ain't it?
Ain't it?
Now, would you like a bicky?
I saved some from the mayor's
reception in bridlington.
No?
Well, would you like one,
Norman? Ooh! Ooh, I say!
Thank you, I will.
If you don't mind
my saying so, sir,
there seems little point
in discharging yourself
from hospital,
and then coming to sit here
like niobe prior to
being turned into stone.
So...
Shall we make a start?
No, don't do that.
That's what I'm here for.
Oh.
Oh, I know how it feels.
I had a friend...
...worse than you he was,
and all they ever wanted to
do with him was put him away.
Ah, no-one should have
to go through that.
That's what my friend said.
You know they'll send you
to colwyn bay,
and you never do any business
in colwyn bay.
And guess what got
my friend well?
Sounds silly, this.
An offer of work.
"Can you understudy scrubby,
outward bound, start Monday?"
Discharged himself,
just like you, my friend did,
took the train up to London,
found digs in Brixton
and never looked back.
Now, what do you make of that?
An offer of work.
You see,
it meant that someone...
...was thinking of him.
It was ever such a comfort.
Hm...
And here's something to cheer
you up. A full house tonight.
People thinking of you,
wanting to see you act.
Really? A full house?
- Now, shall we make a start?
- What play is it tonight?
- King lear, sir.
That's impossible.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, that's nice, isn't it?
People paying good money to
see you, and you say impossible.
Very, very nice indeed,
i don't think.
I don't want to be seen.
Well, that's, um...Difficult,
when you're playing king lear
with the lighting you use.
I don't want to see
her ladyship.
Oh, well, even more difficult,
when she's playing
your daughter.
You saw her a moment ago.
You were alone together.
Were we?
What play is it tonight?
King lear, sir.
- Madge was wrong.
- Yes, well, she often is.
I have been ill before this.
Did you ever see me
in the corsican brothers?
Ah, no. Alas, sir,
before my time.
I went on with
double pneumonia then.
Apt when you're playing
the corsican brothers.
I'd rather have
double pneumonia than this.
Than what?
Oh. What prevents me from
packing up and going home?
Why am I here,
when I should be asleep?
Wasn't that a strange light in
market square this evening?
I don't remember
being in market square.
You've been missing
all day.
What...What do you remember?
Walking, walking, walking.
If only I could find
a good, catchy title.
I think "my life"
a little plain, don't you?
- Still stuck, are we?
- No, no.
I wrote a little today.
Two or three sides
of an exercise book.
But I can't find a title.
Oh, well,
we'll think of something.
See if it's still in my jacket.
And my reading glasses.
I thought I had written today.
No, well, you'll not
see much through those.
- Well, look for me!
- No.
Is there anything?
Evidently not.
It cannot be lear again.
Shall we start our make-up?
Yeah, I'm getting out of here.
I'm not staying in this place
a moment longer!
I am surrounded by vipers!
Betrayal on every side!
I'm being crushed!
The life blood
is draining out of me.
The load is too much!
Norman! Norman!
Oh, if you have any regard
for me, don't listen to him!
- Who? Who?
- More, more, more!
I cannot give any more!
I have nothing more to give!
I want a tranquil senility!
I'm an old man!
I don't want to go on
painting my face,
night after night after night,
dressing up in clothes
that are not my own!
I'm not a child
dressing up for charades!
This is my work!
This is my life's work!
Oh, I'm an actor!
Who cares if I go out there
tonight or any other night
and shorten my life,
shorten my life?
I don't care if there's
only three people out front,
or if the audience laughs
when they shouldn't,
or don't when they should.
One person, just one person
will know and understand
and I act for him.
I cannot move that
which cannot be moved.
What are we on about now?
I'm filled inside with stone,
stone upon stone.
I cannot lift myself.
The weight is too much.
Oh, I know futility
when I see it.
I dream at night
of unseen hands driving
wooden stakes into my feet.
The dream is long
and graceless.
I awake, sweat-drenched,
poisoned.
The whole day long, there's
a burning heat inside of me,
driving all else from my mind.
Oh!
Oh.
What did I do today?
You walked.
You thought you wrote,
and you went into market square,
and a woman kissed your hand
and said you were lovely
in the corsican brothers.
How do you know all this?
Has someone been talking?
I don't wish to hurry you, sir.
No, I lie, I do.
- I hate the swines.
- Who?
He's a hard taskmaster!
He drives me too hard!
I have too much to carry.
Yes?
I'd like to see him.
I'd rather you didn't.
It's my responsibility
to take the curtain up tonight.
There isn't much time.
Things have reached
a delicate stage.
What's all the whispering?
Nothing, nothing!
- Has he begun to make up yet?
- Not yet.
Do you realize how late it is?
They'll be calling the half
in a moment.
I know how late it is.
Then on your head be it.
Oh, look!
A dressing gown!
Shall we put it on
and keep ourselves warm?
What does it matter where you
were or what you did today?
You're here in the theater,
safe and sound,
where you belong.
Another full house. Lovely.
Really? A full house?
They'll be standing in the gods.
You know they bombed
the grand theatre, Plymouth?
And much else
of the city besides.
I made my debut
in the grand theatre, Plymouth.
They weren't to know.
I shouldn't have come out this
Autumn, but I had no choice.
He made me.
- Who?
- I should have rested.
Oh, I had a friend
that was ordered to rest.
He obeyed,
and that was the end of him.
He was ever so ill.
Nearly became a catholic.
Right, now, would you like
a little rubdown?
I'm not surprised
you're feeling dispirited.
It's been ever such a hard time.
No young men to play juveniles
and the trouble
with Mr. Davenport-Scott.
What news
of Mr. Davenport-Scott?
The police have opposed bail.
What?
Well, he'd had
his second warning.
How then do we
dispose our forces?
Mr. Thornton is standing by
to play fool.
And who as oswald?
Mr. browne, I'm afraid.
That leaves me a knight short
for "reason not the need".
Well, 98 short, actually,
if you take the text as gospel,
one more or less
won't seem too upsetting.
Herr Hitler has made it
very difficult
for shakespearean companies.
It'll be a chapter
in the book, sir.
I hate to mention it,
but we're going to be short
for the storm.
We've no-one to operate
the wind machine,
not...Not if
Mr. Thornton's to play fool.
Mr. Thornton was ever so good
on the wind machine.
Madge knows the problem,
but she's very unsympathetic.
You tell madge from me,
I must have the storm
at full strength.
What about oxenby?
Not the most amenable
of gentlemen.
Send him to me at the half.
I'll have a word with him.
Better talk
to Thornton, too.
There you are. You see?
That's more like it.
You're where you belong,
doing what you know best,
and you're yourself again.
Right, well, you start
doing your make-up
and I'll go and tell them
to come and see you.
I've cleaned the wig and beard.
Shan't be a minute.
Oh, no, sir! Not othello!
The lines are fouled.
Up on your short,
down on your long.
Is there a dead for it?
Instruct the puppeteer
to renew the string.
The stuffing is escaping
at the seams.
Straw from a scarecrow lies
scattered down stage left.
I would have given anything
to see the play tonight.
There's you
all blacked up and...
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Cordelia saying, "you beget
me, bred me, loved me".
Well, the time has come,
if you don't mind my saying so,
to stop waxing poetical and to
wax a bit more practical, eh.
Who?
I-Irene.
I've...I've come
for the triple crown.
Enter.
Good evening, sir.
All well?
Oh, yes, thank you, sir.
You've come
for the triple crown.
Yes, sir.
Polish it well.
I like it gleaming.
Yes, sir.
And return it to me
well before curtain up.
I like to wear it
by the quarter.
Yes, sir.
And when I have
used it on stage,
see that it is returned
to my room after the interval.
She has done it before, sir.
I like to be certain.
There it is, my child.
Pretty young thing, aren't you?
Thank you, sir.
Sir.
It's time to age.
They're all the same colour.
Which stick do I use?
I...I can't see the...
The colours.
- Oh, what now?
- How is he?
He'll be alright
if he's left in peace.
I want to see with my own eyes.
No, no, he's not
to be disturbed.
And what about the understudies?
Well, no, uh...He knows all
about it. Everything's in hand.
You realize now there's going
to be an audience out there.
It'd be silly, going through
this, if there wasn't.
Will he be ready on time?
Will he be well enough?
Yes.
Madge, can I just, um...
Who was that?
Just a Minion, minioning.
Too many interruptions.
My concentration.
- Norman?
- Yes, sir?
How does the play begin?
- Which play, sir?
- Tonight's, tonight's.
I cannot remember
the first line.
"Attend the lords of France
and burgundy, gloucester."
Yes.
Yes. What performance is this?
Well, tonight
will be your, er...
227th performance
of the part, sir.
227 lears, and I cannot
remember the first line.
Haven't we forgotten
something else, sir?
If you don't mind my asking.
- We have to sink our cheeks.
- Mm...
Yes.
I shall look like this
in my coffin.
And a broad straight line
of number 20 down the nose.
Give you strength, you say.
Now, surgical spirit.
I know how
to stick on a beard.
I've been a depicter
for 50 years.
I shall need a rest
after the storm scenes.
There's no need
to tell me. I know.
And shall we take extra care
with the wig join tonight?
I shall give them
a good one tonight.
- Norman!
- Yes, sir?
What's the first line again?
All this clitter-clatter,
chitter-chatter.
"Attend the lords of France
and burgundy, gloucester."
You've put it out of my mind.
You keep silent
when I'm dressing!
I have work to do,
hard bloody labour!
Sir, sir...
I cannot remember
the first line!
100,000 performances,
I have to ask you
for the first line!
Yes, well,
I'll take you through it.
Take me through it?
Nobody takes you through it!
You're put through it,
night after night after night!
I haven't the strength.
Well, you're a fine one,
i must say.
You of all people.
You disappoint me...
...if you don't mind
my saying so.
You, who always say
that self-pity's the most
unattractive quality
on stage or off.
Who have you been working
for all these years?
The ministry of information?
Struggle and survival, you say,
that's all that matters.
The whole world's struggling
for bloody survival,
so why can't you?
My dear Norman, I seem to
have upset you. I'm sorry.
I...I understand. We...
We cannot always be strong.
There is danger
in covering the cracks.
Never mind about
covering the cracks.
What about covering
your wig join?
- Half an hour, please, sir.
- Already?
Well, you were in late
this evening, sir.
Why hasn't she returned
with the triple crown?
I like it on my head by now.
- Look.
- What?
My hands. They're shaking.
Oh, well, they'll be
very effective in the part.
Don't forget to make them up.
I can't stop them. You do them.
- No, no.
- Yes.
Look here.
It must be infectious.
I can face the division of my
kingdom. I can cope with fool.
I can bear the reduction
of my retinue.
I can stomach the curses
i have to utter.
I can even face
being whipped by the storm.
But I dread the final entrance.
To carry my cordelia...
Dead,
dead,
to cry like the wind, howl...
...howl, howl.
To lay her gently
on the ground. To die.
Have I the strength?
If you haven't the strength,
no-one has.
You're a good friend,
Norman.
Thank you, sir.
You shall be rewarded.
Pardon me while I get my violin.
Do not mock me.
I may not have long.
My father used to say that.
He lived till he was 93.
He may still be alive
for all I know.
Bonzo, how do you feel?
A little more myself, pussy.
You see?
Once he's assumed the disguise,
he's a different man.
Ha-ha!
"Egad, madam,
thou hast a porcupine wit."
And are you sure
you're able to go on?
On and on and on.
Pussy, I thought it was
the black one tonight.
My dear.
Did I wake in the night, pussy?
Did I thank you
for watching over me?
Was there talk of violence?
No, bonzo, you dreamt it.
I still have the feeling.
Would you like me to fetch the
cloak and tie it on as usual?
Yes, as usual.
Oh, erm...
Mr. Thornton and Mr. oxenby are
waiting outside to see you.
Would you like me
to ask them to come in?
I don't want to see oxenby.
He frightens me.
Mind you, he was the best iago
I've ever had or seen
and I include
that four-foot-six ponce
sir Arthur palgrove...
That's more like the sir
we know and love.
...there were more lines on his
face than steps to the gallery.
I saw his lear.
I was pleasantly disappointed.
Sir Arthur palgrove.
Who advises his majesty,
answer me that?
You're a miracle worker, Norman.
Thank you, your ladyship.
Here's a piece
of chocolate for you.
Oh, thank you, your ladyship.
It'll be all hands to the pump
tonight, Norman.
Just a small part of
the service, your ladyship.
Thank you.
Don't suppose I didn't
see that, because I did.
There are more children
in this beloved land of ours,
scavenging the larders
for something sweet.
If only they came to me,
I could tell them
of the one person in england
who has an inexhaustible
supply of chocolate.
Because it is I who have to
carry her dead as my cordelia.
It is I who have to
lift her up in my arms.
"Thank Christ,"
i thought, "for rationing",
but, no, she would find
sugar in a sand dune.
Shall I show the actors in, sir?
What? No, I don't... no.
You have to see the actors.
Oh, Mr. Thornton.
Mr. Thornton to see you, sir.
Well, Geoffrey,
does the costume fit?
Mr. Davenport-Scott
was such a tall man.
Mr. Davenport-Scott was a worm.
You look, er...
- Do you know the lines?
- - Yes.
Don't keep me waiting for them.
- Oh, no.
- - Pace, pace, pace.
- Pace, pace, pace.
- Yes.
- And keep out of my focus.
- - Yes.
The boom lights placed
in the downstage wings
are for me and me only.
Yes, old man, I know.
You must find
what light you can.
- Right.
- Let me hear you sing.
What?
For "he that has and a little
tiny wit...Heigh-ho."
He...He that has...
He...He...
Alright, speak it.
Don't sing it.
And in the storm scene,
if you are going to put
your arms around my legs
as Mr. Davenport-Scott did,
then around my calves,
not my thighs.
- He almost ruptured me twice.
I'd rather I didn't, old man.
Feel it, my boy, feel it.
It is the only way.
- Whatever takes you.
- Right.
But do not let it
take you too much.
Remain within the bounds
and, at all costs,
remain still when I speak.
Of course.
Serve the playwright
and keep your teeth in.
Well, it...It's only
when I'm nervous.
Well, you will be nervous,
i guarantee it.
There will be no extra payment
for this performance.
I believe your contract
is "play as cast".
Yes.
Good fortune
attend your endeavours.
Thank you, sir.
God bless, Geoffrey.
I'd rather face
the Nazi hordes any day.
I hope Mr. Churchill has
better men in the cabinet.
Mr. oxenby is waiting, sir.
Oxenby? What...What... I don't
know. What does oxenby want?
Well, it's not what he wants,
it's what we want,
someone to operate
the wind machine.
I don't want to see oxenby.
I can't bear the man.
It's stifling in here.
We'll have no storm without him.
Mr. oxenby to see you, sir.
You wanted to see me?
I...I don't know.
Erm...Why? I...Uh...Norman?
Sir was wondering if
he could ask of you a favor.
He can ask.
You've not...Not been...Um,
with us...Very long,
but I'm sure you've seen
enough to know
that we're not so much
a...A company
as one great big happy family
and, er...We all
muck in as required.
As I'm sure you've heard,
Mr. Davenport-Scott will not
be rejoining the company.
Yes, I've heard.
You share a dressing room
with one or two of them,
you hear nothing else.
It upsets
the pansy fraternity...
...when one of their number
is caught.
And because Mr. Thornton
is having to play fool,
and...And because our two
elderly knights are...
Are setting the hovel
behind the cloth
during the storm scene,
we've no-one to operate
the wind machine.
We'd ask Mr. browne, but he's
really rather too fragile.
We were wondering
if you'd turn the handle.
In short, no.
Huh?
Anything else?
Has he read my play yet?
Ha-ha.
Perhaps the Russians have had
a setback on the eastern front.
Bolshevism will be
the ruin of the theater.
What are we going to do?
Fancy not wanting to muck in!
He hates me.
I can feel his hatred.
All I stand for, he despises.
I wouldn't read his play, even
if he were commissar of culture.
Oh, I've read it.
- Is there a part for me?
- Oh, yes.
I know what oxenby's up to.
He's writing plays for critics,
not people.
Oughtn't we to be quiet
for a bit, sir?
Where's that girl
with the triple crown?
Don't fuss.
I'll go and find her.
Oh, my dear. Norman has
just gone to find you.
Has he? I must have missed him.
Remind me of your name, child.
It's Irene, sir.
Irene. Charming.
Were you at the r.A.D.A.?
No, sir.
I went straight into rep.
Of course.
I remember. Which rep?
- Maidenhead.
- Maidenhead.
Yes.
Next week, in eastbourne.
I can't find her.
Just admiring
her bone structure.
- Run along, Irene.
- Yes, run along.
A born actress.
Can tell by the cheekbones.
Put the crown on.
It's almost the quarter.
Shall I fetch her ladyship and
ask her to tie on the cloak?
How does the play begin?
God help me, that child
has driven it from my mind!
Yeah?
Quarter of an hour, please.
A few minutes late. I'm sorry.
That girl Irene's going
to be the death of me.
The quarter. I can't.
I...I'm not ready.
Tell them to go home.
Give them their money back.
I hate the swines.
I can't, I can't!
What are you saying?
Do you want the performance
cancelled?
- No, he doesn't.
- - How does it begin?
- For your own good...
- - How does it begin?
You'll never get through it.
- He will.
- How does it begin?!
Get out. He'll be good and
ready when the curtain goes up.
We've run out of time.
There's 20 minutes yet.
We'll go up late, if necessary.
Leave me in peace!
I cannot remember the lines!
Norman! Norman,
how does it begin?
Quarter of an hour,
please.
"He hath been out nine years,
and away he shall again."
"The king is coming.
"Attend the lords of France
and burgundy, gloucester."
"Attend the lords of France
and burgundy, gloucester."
"I shall, my liege."
Yes?
"Meantime we shall
express our darker..."
"Meantime we shall express
our darker purpose."
"Give me the map."
Don't tell me.
Don't tell me. I know it.
I'll ask for it if I need it.
I have played this part
before, you know.
"What do I fear?"
Wrong. "Know we have
divided in three..."
"Myself? There's none else by.
"True, I talk of dreams,
"which are the children
of a troubled brain."
Wrong play, wrong play.
Can this cockpit hold
the vasty fields of France?
No, that's another wrong play.
Men should be what they seem.
MacBeth shall sleep no more!
Now look
what you've gone and done.
What?
Go out, go out. You've quoted
the Scottish play.
Did I Mac... did I?
- Oh, Christ!
- Out!
Now turn round three times.
Two, three.
Right, knock.
Swear.
Pisspots!
"And my poor fool is hang'd".
You'll be all right.
Struggle, bonzo.
Survival, pussy.
Beginners, please, act one.
- Beginners, please, sir.
- Thank you.
Let us descend and survey
the scene of battle.
The night I played
my first lear,
there was a thunderstorm,
a real thunderstorm!
But now they send bombs!
How much more have I to endure?
We are to speak
Shakespeare tonight
and they will go to any lengths
to prevent me!
I shouldn't take it
too personally, sir.
Bomb, bomb, bomb us
into submission if you dare,
but each word I speak will be
a shield against your savagery,
each line I utter a protection
against your terror!
I don't think
they can hear you, sir.
- Swines! Barbarians!
Oh! Oh!
Oh, no. Oh, sir.
Just as we were winning.
Perhaps it's timely.
He can't go on.
- Look at him. Fetch madge.
- No.
- Norman!
- Sir.
- Get me down to the stage.
- Yes.
By Christ,
no squadron of fascist
bolsheviks will stop me now!
- Do as I say!
- Yes.
- How is he?
- Who'll make the announcement?
Mr. Davenport-Scott, of course.
- No.
- Oh, dear.
- You, then, Norman.
- Me, sir?
Do not argue.
I've given my orders.
I have enough to contend with.
- Sir, I'm not equipped...
- Do it.
- Come on.
Take the apron off,
for goodness' sake.
Oh...! Oh...!
Oh...!
- Ladies and gentlemen...
- Ladies and gentlemen...
...the warning has just gone.
- An air raid...
...is in progress.
We shall proceed
with the performance.
Will those...
Will those who wish to live...
Will anyone who wishes to leave
do so as quietly as possible?
Thank you.
Oh!
Stand by.
Stand by on tabs.
Stand by on stage. Go lx.
Go flies. Curtain going up.
I thought the king
had more affected
the Duke
of Albany than cornwall.
It did always seem so to us.
Geoffrey,
was I all right?
Yes, yes, old man, damn good.
Your ladyship, was I all right?
Better than Mr. Davenport-Scott.
Really? Oh, do you mean that?
I was ever so nervous.
But do you think
anyone noticed the slip?
"Will those who wish to live."
Ooh, I could have kicked meself.
- I-i was really alright?
- You were fine.
- Did he say anything?
- No.
Cueing grams.
My services
to your lordship.
I must love you,
and sue to know you...
- Stand by, please.
- Alright, sir.
- Cueing timpani, sir.
...and away
he shall again.
The king is come.
Sir?
- What?
- Her ladyship's entered.
Oh, quite a nice round
so it's your turn now.
You see? What did I say?
Please, sir, the entrance.
You're on.
Please, sir, it's your entrance.
Methought I saw him.
His procession formed,
a hundred knights his escort.
Mr. oxenby's
having to extemporize.
"Attend the lords
of France and burgundy."
The king, my father, was,
methought, behind me.
From our camp we marched,
a goodly distance,
I ahead, as is our custom.
Sir, the natives
are getting restless.
Sound the fanfare again.
Ah! Methinks I see the king.
Oh, sir.
No, I was mistook.
My lord, with thy consent i
shall to his majestic side,
there to discover
his royal progress.
Is he coming or isn't he?
Yes!
I'm cueing the king's
fanfare again.
"Attend the lords of France
and burgundy, gloucester."
Cue the knights,
cue the knights!
Oh! Go on, go on.
Enter, for god's sake.
Attend the lords of
France and burgundy, gloucester.
I shall, my liege.
Meantime we shall express
our darker purpose.
Give me the map there.
Know that we have divided,
in three our kingdom,
and 'tis our fast intent
to shake all cares
and business from our age,
conferring them
on younger selves,
while we unburdened
crawl toward death.
Thou art a lady. If only
to go warm were gorgeous,
why, nature needs not
what thou gorgeous wear'st,
which scarcely keeps thee warm!
But, for true need -
you heavens,
give me that Patience,
Patience I need.
You see me here, you gods,
a poor old man,
as full of grief as age,
wretched in both.
If it be you that stir
these daughters' hearts
against their father,
fool me not so much
to bear it tamely.
Touch me with noble anger!
And let not women's weapons,
water drops,
stain my man's cheeks!
No, you unnatural hags,
I will have such revenges
on you both
that all the world shall -
i will do such things -
what they are yet I know not
but they shall be
the terrors of the earth.
You think I'll weep?
No, I'll not weep.
I have full cause of weeping,
but this heart shall break
into 100,000 flaws
or ere I'll weep.
O fool, I shall go mad!
Let us withdraw.
'Twill be a storm.
I know you.
Where's the king?
Stay out of my focus, Geoffrey.
Bids the wind
blow the earth into the sea
or swell the curl'd water
'bove the main,
that things might change
or cease.
Geoffrey, wait.
Don't get in the light.
Don't hold up, no pauses.
Just keep the pace going.
Pace, pace, pace, pace,
pace, pace, pace, pace.
...his heart-struck injuries.
Sir, I do know you,
open this purse,
and take what it contains.
- A fie on this storm!
- Stand by.
- I shall go seek the king!
- - Stand by lx.
Now. Go.
Blow, winds,
and crack your cheeks!
Rage, blow! You cataracts
and hurricanoes, strike!
Thou sulphurous
and thought-executing fires!
Louder! He wants it louder!
Singe my white head!
And thou, all-shaking thunder,
strike flat
the thick rotundity o'th'world,
crack nature's moulds,
all germens...
Come on, louder!
He wants it louder, come on!
...ingrateful man!
That's not
loud enough! Louder!
Rumble thy bellyful!
Spit, fire! Spout, rain!
Come on! Come on!
Nor rain, wind, thunder,
fire are my daughters!
...and white as this.
Oh, ho! 'Tis foul.
Where was the storm?
Where was the storm?
I ask for cataracts
and hurricanoes,
and I'm given nothing
but trickles and whistles!
I demand oak-cleaving
thunderbolts
and you answer
with farting flies!
- Norman, Norman!
- Sir?
You have thwarted me!
I was there, within sight.
I had only to be spurred upwards
and the glory was mine
for the plucking,
and there was naught,
zero, silence,
a breeze, oh, a breeze!
A shower, a collision
of cotton wool,
a flapping of butterfly wings.
I want a tempest, not a drizzle!
Something will have to be done.
I demand to know what happened
tonight to the storm!
I'm pleased you're pleased.
I've never known
you not complain
when you've really been at it,
and tonight,
one could safely say,
without fear of contradiction,
you were at it.
Come on, rest now.
You've the interval and all
of gloucester's blinding
before, "no, they cannot
touch me for coining."
Now try to sleep.
You've been through it...
...or been put through it,
whichever you prefer,
and you need quiet,
as the deaf mute said
to the piano tuner.
Mighty, her ladyship
thought you were tonight,
she did.
That was the word she used.
Mighty.
Ah.
Of course, I cannot comment
on the storm scene,
but I did hear,
"o, reason not the need".
Tremble-making.
Never seen you so full
of the real thing,
if you don't mind
my saying so, sir.
And here's a funny thing.
In the storm scene,
while we were beating
ourselves delirious
and I was having to jump
between thunder sheet
and timpani
like a juggler with rubber
balls and Indian clubs,
mr.Oxenby
came to our aid uninvited.
Not a word said,
just gave assistance
when assistance was needed.
Afterwards, just before
the interval, I thanked him.
"Get stuffed," he said,
which wasn't nice,
and then he added scornfully,
"i don't know why I helped",
and I said, "because
we are a band of brothers,
"and you're one of us
in spite of yourself."
I did, that's what I said.
And he hobbled away,
his head down...
...and if he'd been given to
muttering, he'd have muttered.
Darkly.
Are you asleep, sir?
Oh, to be driven thus.
I hate the swines.
Who? Who is it that you hate?
The critics?
The critics? Hate the critics?
I have nothing
but compassion for them.
How can one hate the crippled,
the mentally deficient
and the dead?
- Bastards.
- - Who, then?
Who, then, what?
Who, then, is it that you hate?
Oh, let me rest, Norman.
You must stop questioning me.
Let me rest.
But don't leave me
till I'm asleep.
Don't leave me alone.
I'm a spent force.
My days are numbered.
- Is he asleep?
- I think so, yes.
- I'll sit with him.
- Oh.
Well, don't wake him,
your ladyship.
He's ever so tired.
Is it my cue?
No, it's still the interval.
I have things to say.
Norman tells me you thought
i was mighty tonight.
I never said
anything of the kind.
He makes these things up.
- What have you to say?
- What I always have to say.
You know my answer.
You've worked hard.
You've saved.
Enough's enough.
Tonight, in your curtain
speech, make the announcement.
I can't.
- You won't.
- I have no choice.
You'll die,
or end up a vegetable.
Well, that's your affair.
But you're not going
to drag me with you.
I am helpless, pussy.
I do what I'm told.
I cower. I'm frightened
of being whipped.
- I am driven.
- Driven, no. Cruel, yes.
Obstinate, yes,
ruthless, yes.
Don't.
For an actor, you have
a woeful lack of insight.
Use your great imagination.
Use your inspired gifts.
Try to imagine what I feel,
what I'm forced to go through.
I do! But I need you beside me,
familiar, real!
I am beside you, darning tights,
very familiar, quite real.
All I ask, bonzo,
is that we stop now.
Tonight. The end of the week.
But no more.
I can't take any more.
- It's not possible.
- It is possible.
No.
You deceive no-one
but yourself!
If that were true,
why, then, am I here,
with bombs falling,
risking life and limb, why?
Not by choice. I have a duty.
I have to keep the faith.
- Oh, balls.
- What?
You do nothing
without self-interest
and you drag everyone with you.
Me, chained, not even by law.
Oh, would marriage have made
that much difference to you?
You misunderstand deliberately.
I should have made her
divorce me. Huh!
You didn't get a divorce
because you wanted a knighthood.
That's not true.
True. You know
where your priorities lie.
Whatever you do is to your
advantage and to no-one else's.
Talk about being driven.
You make yourself sound
like a disinterested stagehand.
You do nothing
without self-interest.
You, self, alone.
Pussy, please, I'm sinking.
Do not push me
further into the mud.
Sir, her ladyship, fantasies.
For god's sake, you're
a third-rate actor-manager
on a tatty tour
of the provinces,
not some colossus
bestriding the narrow world.
Sir. Her ladyship.
Look at me, darning tights.
Look at you.
Lear's hovel is luxury
compared to this.
I'm not well.
I have half of lear's life
ahead of me.
I have to carry you in my arms.
I have howl, howl, howl,
yet to speak.
Sir! Her ladyship!
We're a laughing stock!
You'd never get a knighthood,
because the king doesn't
possess a double-edged sword.
Do you remember, years ago,
an actress, one of our gonerils?
She was tall. Dark, handsome
girl with a grecian nose.
Flora bacon.
Was it?
Yes, perhaps it was.
Flora.
Do you remember the night
i was rather hard on Norman,
because he'd got
my tights inside out,
during a quick change
in "the wandering Jew"?
Or was it
"the sign of the cross"?
Whichever.
Well, she turned on me.
"He may be your servant," she
said, "but he is a human being."
Then, to Norman, she said,
"why don't you leave him?
"Why do you put up with it?"
And Norman said, "don't fuss.
"He only gives
as good as he gets.
"He has to take it out
on someone," he said,
and he's right,
because flora bacon
didn't understand.
Slave-driver she called me.
Why ever did I employ her?
Her mother was lady bacon.
She invested 200 pounds
in the company.
You know, I thought tonight
i caught sight of him
or saw myself as he sees me.
Speaking "reason not the need".
"Go on, you bastard!" I seemed
to be saying or hearing.
"Go on, you've more to give!
"Don't hold back!
More, more, more!"
And I was watching lear! Yes!
Each word he spoke
was fresh invented.
I had no knowledge of what came
next, what fate awaited him.
The agony was in the moment
of acting created.
And I saw an old man...
...and the old man...
...was me.
Don't leave me.
I'll rest easy if you stay.
But don't ask of me
the impossible.
Otherwise...
...without you,
in darkness,
i will see a locked door,
a sign "closed" in the window,
closed, gone away...
...and a drawn blind.
I'll stay till Norman returns.
I meant longer.
Please.
Oh, please, pussy.
Reassure me.
I'm sick.
Sick.
Yes, so am I.
Sick.
I'm sick of cold railway trains,
cold waiting rooms,
cold Sundays on crewe,
and eating cold food
late at night.
I'm sick of packing and
unpacking and of darning tights.
I'm sick of the smell
of rotting costumes
and naphthalene,
and, most of all, I'm sick
of reading week after week
that I'm barely adequate,
too old,
the best of a bad
supporting cast,
unequal to you,
unworthy of your gifts...
...and I'm sick of having
to put on a brave face.
I should have left you
in Baltimore
on the last American tour.
I should have accepted
mr.Feldman's offer
and taken the 20th century west.
Feldman thought
i wouldn't photograph well.
Swine.
I hate the cinema.
I believe in living things.
How quickly one's looks go.
They haven't built a camera
large enough to record me.
I wouldn't have minded
a modest success.
Why they knighted
that dwarf
Arthur palgrove
i shall never know.
"Arise, sir Arthur,"
said the king.
"But, sir, I wasn't kneeling."
Not once in his whole career
did he put a toe outside London.
- I liked America.
- I hated the swines.
Act two beginners,
please.
I must rest now, pussy.
I want peace.
All you want is to have
your cake and to eat it.
I've never seen any point
in having cake
unless one is going to eat it.
Ha-ha-ha.
Everything jolly?
Don't you know what knocking is?
Oh, please, sir,
not in front of her ladyship.
Well, I've been mingling.
You should hear
what they think out there.
I have never known
an interval like it.
Michelangelo, William Blake,
god knows who else
you reminded them of.
One poor boy, an airman,
head bandaged,
was weeping in the stalls bar,
comforted by an older man,
once blond, now gray,
parchment skin and dainty hands,
who went on saying,
"there, there, Evelyn,
"it's only a play"...
...which didn't seem to me
any comfort at all,
because if it hadn't
been a play,
then "there, there, Evelyn"
wouldn't be so upset.
- Michelangelo, did they?
- And Blake.
- I'm going to my room.
- - Please stay.
You must rest, bonzo,
mustn't he, Norman?
Yes, he must.
Pussy.
Be gentle with her ladyship.
I'm always gentle
with her ladyship.
Especially gentle.
Why?
Time of life.
Oh...!
You mean flushes
and dizzy spells?
She's become very preoccupied
with herself.
Sounds like
a bad attack of change.
Be gentle.
I don't want her hurt.
Mm-hm.
Ay, ay.
Sleep now.
- Anything else you want?
- Oblivion.
That'll come sooner or later,
and I hope later.
Well, I shall wake you
in plenty of time
so you can enter fantastically,
dressed in wildflowers.
Sleep tight,
don't let the bugs bite.
Fetch madge!
Yes?
It's going well, I think.
Except for your first entrance.
Come here.
Hold my hand.
Please.
It's like ice.
Cold with fear.
What are you frightened of?
Of what is to come.
You know who you're talking to,
do you? It's me,
not someone to impress.
I'm speaking from my heart.
'Cause I've never before
felt so lonely.
Oh, please.
I have a show to run.
Listen to me.
I am frightened
of what is to come...
...and I meant it, because
for the first time in my life,
the future is hidden from me.
I see no friends.
I'm not warmed by fellowship.
I know only...
Awful solitude.
An occupational hazard.
You wanted to see me.
About what?
I look on you
as my one true friend.
I have to go back to the corner.
Have you been happy?
Has it been worth it?
No, I've not been happy.
Yes, it's been worth it.
Madge dear...
...in my will, I've left you
all my press-cutting books.
I don't want to hear what
you've left me in your will.
Cuttings and notices that span
a lifetime, an entire career,
and I've kept them religiously.
Good and bad notices alike. Huh!
Not all that many bad.
Talk of me sometimes.
Speak well of me.
Actors live on only
in the memory of others.
Speak well of me.
This is
a ridiculous conversation.
You're in the middle
of a performance of "lear",
playing less mechanically
than you have of late,
and you talk
as if you're organizing
your own memorial service.
The most wonderful thing
in life is to be remembered.
Speak well of me.
You'll be believed.
You'll be remembered.
Madge dear,
I have something for you.
I want you to have this ring.
If possessions can be dear,
this ring is
the dearest thing I own.
Edmund kean wore this ring
in a play whose title
is an apt inscription
for what I feel...
...a new way to pay old debts.
When you talk of it,
say Edmund kean and I wore it.
I once had it in mind
to give it to you
years ago...
...but...
You were younger then, and i
thought you would misunderstand.
Yes.
A ring from a man to a woman
is easily misunderstood.
I know I'm thought insensitive.
But I'm not blind.
No, I've always known
you were aware
of what the spinster
in the corner felt.
You were right not to give me
the ring years ago.
I lived in hope then.
At least I've seen you every
day, made myself useful to you.
I settled for what I could get.
You are the only one
who truly loves me.
Beginners for act two.
Who?
It's Irene. I'm returning
the triple crown, sir.
Come.
Put it down.
Sir, will it disturb you
if I say something?
Depends what it is.
I just wanted to thank you.
For what?
- The performance this evening.
- It's not over yet.
I felt honoured
to be on the stage.
Open that drawer. You will
find a photograph of me.
Oh,
i love coming into this room.
I can feel the power
and the mystery.
In days gone by,
this would have been a place
where the high priests robed.
A kindred spirit.
Lock the door.
Come nearer.
It's Irene.
Irene.
- You want to act?
- Yes.
- Passionately?
- Yes.
With every fiber of your being?
Yes.
To the exclusion of all else?
Yes.
You must be prepared
to sacrifice
what most people call...
...life.
I am.
Your birth sign?
Scorpio.
Good. Ambition,
secretiveness, loyalty.
Capable of great jealousy.
Essential qualities
for the theater.
Have you good legs?
Come closer.
Let me see.
Higher.
Too good.
All the best actresses
have legs like tree trunks.
There's not much of you,
is there?
Such small bones.
Are you getting enough to eat?
So young.
So young.
That's more like it!
Too late.
- Too late.
- Oh! Oh!
Well, now, my dainty duck,
my deary-o.
Let go of me.
What was all that about? Hm?
He seems better.
Better than what or whom
as the case may be?
I didn't think he'd get through
the performance tonight.
He's not through it yet.
- I'm waiting.
- For what?
A graphic description of events.
Out with it, or I shall
slap your face hard.
Oh, I thought we were friends.
I thought we were too, Irene.
I shall long remember
welcoming you into the company
in the prop room of the palace
theatre, Newark-on-Trent.
You were locked in the arms
of the prince of Morocco,
a married man,
and ever such a comic sight,
his tights round his ankles
and you smeared black,
and I said, "don't worry.
"Mum's the word,
but don't let it happen again."
Sorry, what am i
supposed to have done?
- Well, you tell me.
- About what?
About sir.
Oh, you know who sir is, Irene.
I'm late. I have to help her
ladyship with her armour.
Her ladyship's armour will keep.
Perhaps you didn't understand
the question. What did sir do?
I'm not telling you.
Then I'll mark you
for life.
You! You strike me
and I...I'll tell sir.
I will. I will.
I'll tell sir. I'll tell sir.
Oh, you tell sir? Oh, on me?
I quake in my boots.
I shan't be able to eat my tea.
Oh, tell sir?
Never mind "tell sir".
I'll tell you.
He did something,
something unseen and furtive,
something that
gave him pleasure.
- He lifted me up in his arms.
- Lifted you up?
And I understood,
i understood what he meant.
"So young, so young,"
he said, and lifted me up.
"That's more like it," he cried,
and I knew, cradled in his arms,
that it was youth
and newness he was after.
It's not youth
or talent or star quality
he's after, ducky,
but a moderate eater.
There you are.
You're late with my armour.
Off you go, dear. You'll have
to find another canoe to paddle.
Ours, I'm afraid...
...has holes.
Go lx.
Be brief in it - to the castle,
for my writ is on the life
of lear and on cordelia.
Nay, send in time!
Haste thee
for thy life.
You're on.
I wish you wouldn't do that.
You remind me of a labourer.
Some good I mean to do
despite of mine own nature.
Oh! Oh! God almighty!
Cue lx.
Howl!
Howl, howl, howl!
O, you are men of stones.
Had I your tongues and eyes,
I'd use them so that
heaven's vault should crack.
She's gone forever.
I know when one is dead
and when one lives.
She's dead as earth.
Lend me a looking glass.
That if her breath will mist
or stain the stone,
why, then...
She lives.
This feather stirs. She lives.
If it be so,
it is a chance which does
redeem all sorrows
that ever I have felt.
Is this the promised end?
Or image
of that horror?
And my poor fool is hanged.
No, no, no life?
Why should a dog,
a horse, a rat have life,
and thou no breath at all?
Thou'lt come no more,
never, never,
never,
never,
never.
I pray you, undo this button.
I thank you, sir.
Do you see this?
Look on her,
her lips.
Look there,
look there.
Look up, my lord.
Stand by curtain down.
O, let him pass.
He hates him that would upon
the rack of this tough world
stretch him out longer.
He's gone.
The weight of this sad time
we must obey.
Speak what we feel,
not what we ought to say.
The oldest hath borne most.
We that are young,
shall never see so much,
nor live...
So long.
Go flies.
We've done it, will.
We've done it.
Stand by for your curtain calls.
Curtain going up.
What play tomorrow?
Richard III.
Oh, slavery.
Bloody slavery.
Norman, Norman.
- Sir.
- What will happen to you?
Can you be
a little more explicit?
What will happen to you
if I cannot continue?
Oh, stop it.
Nothing ever happens to me.
I lead a life
entirely without incident.
But if I should be
unable to continue...
Well, there's no chance of that
so I'm not bothering to answer.
- I worry about you, my boy.
- Don't.
Who?
- Geoffrey.
- Come. Oh, god.
Just popped in to say
good night, old man.
Good night, Geoffrey.
Very fine in the storm scene,
my boy.
I felt your love,
and that's what matters.
Oh, thank you.
Fool is by far
the most important part
I've ever played in Shakespeare.
I hope you feel
i didn't let you down.
Offer Geoffrey
a small glass of beer, Norman.
Thank you.
Well, such an odd feeling
tonight, old man,
rather exciting to reach my age
to prove to others
that...One can act.
Hm. That's the wonderful thing
about this life of ours.
It's never too late.
Surprising things happen.
But there are disadvantages.
One gets the taste for more.
- Cheers.
- May good health attend you.
Bottoms up, Geoffrey.
May I ask you
a question, old man?
Ask.
Fool is a curious role.
You give your all
for almost an hour and a half,
and then vanish into thin air
for the rest of the play.
The next you hear of me is
you saying that I'm hanged.
But why?
By whom?
It seems awfully unfair.
My theory is that,
in William's day,
fool and cordelia were played
by one and same person.
A very good double,
fool and cordelia.
Saved an extra salary,
of course.
Well,
things haven't changed.
As long as you feel
i didn't let you down.
In no particular.
Just one last thing.
I won't keep you.
I know you're very tired.
But when you interviewed me,
I said that
i didn't want too much.
Small parts, I said.
It may not be thought admirable,
but I have never
put a jot at risk.
Never wanted to scale
the heights.
Played goodish parts.
Tours, of course. Never London.
I...I don't complain.
Touring's a good life.
Enjoyed my cricket in the
summer, hockey in the winter...
...lovely women,
long walks,
a weekly change of scene,
the English countryside
in all weathers.
What could be nicer?
But never risked a jot.
No, I've been lucky.
Mustn't complain.
Yeah, I expect I can
get through
to the end
of the chapter.
I've a little put by
and my wife brings in a bit
from her singing lessons.
I've no right to expect work,
not at my age.
War's brought
surprising employment.
All the youngsters at the front.
My grandson,
not a pro...
...was taken prisoner
at tripoli.
Hm. Sorry to be so long-winded.
But the point is, if at
any time circumstances arise,
I should like to be
considered for better parts
and I shouldn't want
an increase in salary.
I shall keep you
in the forefront of my mind.
Thank you, old man.
Well.
Good night.
Thank you for the drink.
Oh.
No, I can manage.
Night, Norman.
Fine fellow.
Fine fellow.
Shall we remove
your make-up, sir?
I hope will is pleased tonight.
- I had a friend...
- Not now, Norman.
I had a friend who had
ever such a sweet singing voice,
but he lost it in colwyn bay
after a bad attack of sea mist.
But it came back to him again,
in the end,
and do you know why?
Because he said to himself,
they also sing
who only stand and serve.
Or words to that effect.
- Are you pissed, Norman?
- Me, sir? Pissed?
Lud, sir Percy,
how you do tousle me.
Let me smell your breath.
There, told you,
sweet as Winston Churchill.
I can't have you pissed.
You're not dressed yet?
I'm a little slow
tonight, pussy.
I'm not waiting.
I'll go back to the digs,
and see if I can get a fire lit.
I won't be long.
Good night, Norman.
I'm not sure whether
i should thank you or not.
Not. I can't bear to be thanked.
Good night.
Yes, good night.
See you tomorrow.
Night!
She's a good woman.
Good woman.
Who?
Mr. oxenby.
- What do you want?
- - My manuscript.
He won't read it, I know that.
Keep your voice down.
He's not gone yet.
Just wait there.
He's a little slow tonight.
All that struggling
and surviving
has tired him, no doubt.
Please, Mr. oxenby.
Outmoded hypocrite.
Tell him from me,
i look forward to a new order.
I want a company
without tyrants.
- Who'd be in charge?
- I would.
You'll be lovely with a bit
of success, Mr. oxenby.
Your nose is browner
than usual tonight, Norman.
Good night, sir.
Good night, Norman.
If you hurry,
you'll catch Mr. oxenby.
Oh!
Oh, god! Oh, good god!
I am tired. Terribly tired.
The room is spinning.
I must lie down.
See if you can get me a taxi
in this godforsaken place.
All in good time.
Oh, don't cry.
Now don't cry.
- There's nothing left.
- You stop that at once!
I had a friend...
Oh, for Christ's sake,
I'm sick of your friends.
The motley crew they are.
Pathetic, lonely, despairing.
- That's nice, isn't it?
- I beg your pardon.
Uncalled for.
Think of me as your friend.
Never despairing.
Have apologized.
Never, never despairing.
Well, perhaps sometimes.
At night.
Or at Christmas when you
can't get a job in a panto.
But never once inside
the building. Never.
Never.
Pathetic maybe,
but not ungrateful.
Too mindful of one's luck,
as the saying goes.
No Duke is more privileged.
Here's beauty, here's...
Spring and summer.
Here pain is bearable.
And never lonely. Not here!
For he that sheds his blood
today with me.
Soft, no doubt.
Sensitive. That's my nature.
Easily hurt,
but that's a virtue.
And I'm not here for
any reasons of my own either.
No-one can accuse me
of base motives.
I have got what I want, and i
don't need anyone to know it.
Inadequate, yes.
But never, never despairing.
I've begun my life.
Fetch it. The book.
I made a start.
You didn't get very far.
- What did I write?
- My life. Dedication.
This book is dedicated
to my beloved pussy,
who has been my splendid spur.
To the spirit of all actors
because of their faith
and endurance
which never fails them.
To those who do the work
of the theater
yet have but small share
in the glory.
The carpenters, electricians,
scene-shifters, property men.
To the audiences,
who have laughed with us,
have wept with us
and whose hearts
have united with ours
in sympathy and understanding.
But finally...
Oh, sir.
To the memory
of William Shakespeare...
...in whose glorious service
we all labor.
Ah.
My life will have to do.
Wait a moment.
Wait a moment.
Carpenters, electricians,
scene-shifters.
But...Sir.
Sir.
Sir?
Oh, sir.
We're not dead, are we?
That's your cue.
You know the line.
You lie! Jack Clinton...
...lives.
Talk about untoward.
Oh. Oh.
You're right.
The room is spinning.
Your ladyship!
Madge!
Anybody!
Wasn't much of a death scene.
Unremarkable...
...and ever so short. For him.
Where's her ladyship?
Oh, left before he did.
Couldn't wait.
I'll telephone her
and I'll get a doctor.
Too late for a doctor, ducky.
What's going to happen to me?
Close the door. Wait outside.
I don't want to wait outside!
I never wait outside!
I want to be with him.
I know my place, ducky.
Try and sober up.
Ambulance, please.
The theatre royal.
Carpenters, electricians,
property men?
You cruel bastard.
You might have remembered.
Yes, your ladyship, it...
It's madge.
I...I was wondering if you
could come to the theater.
Yes.
No, he didn't suffer.
Her ladyship's coming at once.
She took it very calmly.
She asked for him to be
covered in his lear cloak.
Covered in his lear cloak?
Ooh, fetch the photographers,
ducky.
Covered in his lear cloak?
This isn't the death of Nelson,
you know.
Where is it?
Oh...
There's no mention
of stage managers either.
Come out of here.
Are we going to get paid?
I mean, is there
money in the till
after deductions for income tax?
We've got to be paid
for the full week, you know.
Just because the man
dies on a Thursday
doesn't mean to say
we get paid pro rata.
Come away.
Where will I go? Where?
I'm nowhere.
Out of my element.
Oh, I don't want to end up
running a boarding house
in colwyn bay.
What am I going to do?
You can speak well of him.
Speak well of that old sod?
I wouldn't give him
a good character,
not in a court of law.
The ungrateful bastard.
Get out. Get out!
I don't want you in here!
Oh, holy, holy, holy, is it?
This isn't a shrine?
No pissing on the altar!
Stop it.
Speak well of him?
I know what you'd say.
I know all about you, ducky.
I have eyes in my head.
We all have our little sorrows.
I know what you'd say,
stiff upper,
faithful,
loyal, loving.
Yeah, well, I have only
one thing to say about him
and I wouldn't say it
in front of you,
nor her ladyship, nor anyone.
Lips tight shut.
I wouldn't give you
the pleasure, or him.
Specially not him.
If I said what I had to say,
he'd find a way
to take it out on me.
No-one will ever know.
We all have our little sorrows,
ducky.
You're not the only one.
The littler you are...
...the larger your sorrows.
You think you loved him?
What about me?
Oh, this is no place for death.
I had a friend...
