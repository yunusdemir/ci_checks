I'm sorry, is this seat taken?
Oh, um,
well, I was saving it for someone,
but he's late, so go ahead.
Thanks, and who's that?
- My husband.
- Aww.
Oh. Oh, well, he shouldn't
keep you waiting.
Yeah, he's a bit of a prick like that.
- Always working.
- Hmm.
Can I, uh... Can I buy you a drink?
Maybe something a little harder?
Yeah, okay. Um, I'll take a...
Old Fashioned? Something?
Good guess.
Well, I have my moments.
Excuse me, hi. Can I have an
old fashioned with Bulleit?
And a dirty martini with three olives?
Thank you.
So, what does he do, this, um...
husband of yours?
- He's a lawyer.
- Ooh, yikes. God, sorry.
No offense, but those guys, man.
- They're the worst.
- I know.
- So by the book.
- Mm-hmm
You seem way too free-spirited
to be with a lawyer.
- Yeah, maybe I am.
- Yeah.
I think you need more of a visionary.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
Hmm.
- How do you know?
- Oh, it's just what I do.
Really? And what is it you do?
I'm an architect.
- Ah.
- Can you tell by the shirt?
Yeah.
I always wanted to meet an architect.
And now, you have. What
does it feel like?
Yeah, it's good.
- Thanks.
- Thank you.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
- So nice to meet you.
- So nice to meet you, too.
- You're married, huh?
- No, no. I just never...
you know, found the right...
the right woman.
You believe in that?
I don't know, I mean...
Used to.
Well, I'm sure you have plenty of hot
young women throwing themselves at you.
You're a handsome, powerful architect.
You think I'm handsome?
Maybe.
Well, I do have options.
But it seems that, um...
that the woman that I want is taken.
Well...
that just makes it more fun, doesn't it?
Only if you're willing
to break the rules.
I never said I was faithful.
Oh, I see.
And, um...
does your husband know?
He's too busy to notice.
But, you know, trying to control myself.
I think.
So, do you work?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- You do?
- I mean, sometimes, yeah.
- Really? What do you do?
A musician, actually.
Oh, wow.
- Yeah, not really the pop star type,
- That's cool, okay.
But just more of the... I write songs.
Even so, that's, um...
That's really...
fucking hot.
And unexpected.
Oh, good. Well, I like to surprise you.
You know, every time I come here,
they give me a really great room,
if you wanted to go...
upstairs.
Um, well...
See, we'd have to be quick, 'cause...
Can I get the check, please? Thank you.
Oh, I never did ask you your name.
Sidney.
You like that, Sidney?
Hey.
Hi, sleepyhead.
Come here. I don't want this to be over.
Aww. Well...
Hey, don't do that! I
have to go to work.
I don't have a patient
till one, come on.
- Mmm.
- Come on.
Order some breakfast, okay? And relax.
I'll miss you.
Last night was amazing.
- It was really amazing.
- I know.
It was very, very amazing, but...
I'm glad that we're not those people.
I really like who we are.
Room service.
Hello. Hello?
Hey.
Swanky choice.
- Yeah, I just had a meeting.
- Sure you did.
Oh, here.
You can order whatever you want.
Yeah, it's really not my scene.
But I'm sure these people would come
to Brooklyn and say the same thing.
- Oh, my.
- Mm.
- They look good on you.
- Oh, yeah?
- Good morning.
- Hi, she's gonna have...
Pancakes, please.
And I'll take an egg
white omelet, please.
You know, um...
You didn't even kiss me "hello."
I assumed we're past that
stage after the other night.
That was quite a kiss.
Hmm. Well, uh...
Maybe we should go upstairs?
- What?
- Well, you invited me here,
I assume you have a room.
That was... quite an assumption.
I, uh, told you I had a meeting.
With who?
An architect. He's
redesigning this place.
I'm writing a piece on him.
What's he like?
Well,
at first glance, you probably wouldn't
find him all that interesting, but...
He's deep.
And thoughtful.
The kind of person you see and think,
"I just wanna be around you."
Maybe I'd like him.
Yeah, maybe you would.
Hey, I'm really sorry, but
I actually have to run.
- What's going on?
- I have to pick something up.
Oh, well, I have a little time.
I could come with you.
Sure.
If you fancy an adventure.
Miss? Your bag.
Oh, uh, yeah. I'll pick it up later.
- And you say that I lie.
- It's nothing.
- It's just...
- No, no, it's cool.
Just a different kind of meeting.
How was the hotel?
It was great.
Great, thank you. Um...
It was good to get away.
I'm sure.
Hey, Alexis. Do you think I
could pass as an architect?
What?
No, I mean if you met me at a
bar or something like that,
would you believe that?
I mean, I guess.
Are you considering changing careers?
Maybe in another life.
I'm gonna need you to
book flights for Texas.
I explained to them, it's
impossible to do this second-hand.
I'll get on it. Who's going?
It's me, you and Scott.
Jeanie won't come.
You'll cover for both
of us, if that's okay.
Totally.
Mr. Architect.
Yeah...
I'll just be a few minutes. You
can just hang here if you want.
It's way too hot in here.
This isn't your place.
Yeah, it's Sam's.
I hope you're not mad, but
Stevie's my dog, too.
Well, why don't you just talk to him?
I'm sure he'll be reasonable.
I literally asked to take him
for the weekend, that's it.
He was being such a dick
this morning, so fuck it.
I'm just gonna grab his leash.
Uh...
God, you look so scared.
How do you know he's not coming back?
Sam's had the same routine forever.
We're fine.
I, uh... I'm running
late, so I gotta run.
Maybe we can go to your
place next time instead?
Maybe.
That is, if you even have
a place of your own.
Shit, I'm so sorry.
Subway delays. I had to jump off
at 14th and run all the way here.
- Really sorry.
- That's okay, Jean.
It's not like you to be late.
I know, I'm...
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
Oh, I uh... I kind of have a...
Yeah, I can see that. What
happened the other night?
What?
I swear I saw you getting into your car
at the rehearsal studio.
Nope, I was home when you
texted, with Dolly and Michael.
- You're sure?
- Yeah.
Must've been my doppelgänger.
Ha. Your doppelgänger
drives the same car.
- Claire!
- Jean.
Grab your coat. Actually, we're
gonna head outside today.
- We are?
- Mm-hmm.
All right.
Thank you.
Oh, I don't have the
right clothes for this.
It doesn't matter,
today is just a trial.
Well, I can't do this.
I mean, I did yoga for a little
while, but my hamstring...
It's okay.
It doesn't require physical strength
as much as it does the
mind's attention and focus.
Are you supposed to be
taking me out of the office?
Well, if I think it'll help,
it's at my discretion.
Oh, my friends are gonna be hysterical
when they hear I'm hanging
with my therapist...
- Claire, we're not hanging.
- Doing meditat...
This is all part of your recovery.
Let's sit.
I think Rebecca will appreciate
your being open-minded
and trying something new.
Maybe you should tell her.
This is a meditation class focused
on letting go of anxiety...
and detaching from our
inner judgmental voice.
Now, please close your eyes.
The world will not come to an end
because you are taking
time for yourself.
Notice how your breath flows in and out.
We all have noise in our head.
But today, I would like you
to release yourself...
from the excessive thoughts,
your thoughts that build up and up.
So the continuous habit of thinking
turns into a worried kind of chatter.
Though, it's not like you to be late.
There is no need to control
thoughts or thinking.
Maybe we can go to your
place next time instead.
There is no need to change
thoughts or thinking.
That is, if you even have
a place of your own.
Simply allow the thoughts
and observe them.
By acknowledging these thoughts,
they will dissipate and fall away.
Jean?
Do not give them more power.
Jean!
Where they gain power, will
become important, like a secret.
You can't catch me.
You can't catch me!
Oh, yes, I will catch you!
Hey you!
Let go! People are over.
Ah, she's too old to be
wearing a boy's bathing suit.
- She's tough to reason with.
- Trust me, I know.
What's Sadie doing here? I'm
surprised she's allowed over.
Michelle couldn't get her from
Holly's, so I said I'd drop her off.
- Oh, cool.
- ♪ Daddy and Jacqueline ♪
♪ Sitting in a tree ♪
♪ K-i-s-s-i-ng ♪
Hey! Who's Jacqueline?
Daddy's friend. She's a waitress.
Oh.
You know, if Sadie was parading
around in a boy's bathing suit,
Michelle would be freaking out, too.
What is it that you're so afraid of?
I don't know. I just don't want
life to be harder for her.
Oh, come on, honey.
Life is hard for everyone.
We have to look at the big picture.
We can't control who Dolly's
gonna grow up to be.
Now you sound like the therapist.
I don't know why I'm having
such a hard time with it.
Oh, I forgot. I've gotta go to
Texas on Thursday for two nights.
- For the case?
- Yeah, it's unavoidable.
It's okay. I get it.
Guess you're not gonna miss me too much.
We always miss you.
I'm so fucking mad. Like
I can't control myself.
Why don't you sit?
I come home yesterday, and she took him.
She stole my fucking dog.
- Are you sure it was her?
- Uh, yeah!
She was texting me all morning
about how it was unfair.
She didn't even want the
fucking dog in the end.
She liked the idea of having one, but
literally never fed him or walked him.
- She's the most irresponsible...
- Sam, just slow down.
I-I don't know what to do!
She used her old key to
break into my place.
I mean, maybe I should call the police.
- Sam, hold on a second...
- Who am I even protecting anymore?
She thinks I'm a worthless pushover,
but that's not who I'm gonna be anymore.
- No one's saying you're a worthless...
- I'm sick of her controlling me,
keeping me in the wings like I'm some
bullshit fan she shits all over.
I'm telling you, I could
fucking kill her!
Sam.
I have to ask, it's part
of my job to report
if you're a danger to
yourself or to others.
Do you really think I'm capable of that?
I just need you to be honest.
Even if there's an ounce of truth.
I wouldn't even know how to anyway.
I know you're angry, and you
have every right to be.
Is it really worth getting the
police involved, all this drama,
if you can't even really prove it?
One of my neighbors saw Sidney
and another woman leaving.
It must've been Diane.
I bet it's a turn-on for her to try to
fuck a woman in her ex's apartment.
And I found these.
And I'm supposed to go on a
date with Emily tomorrow.
To catch up.
I think I'll cancel. I'm
really not in the mood.
I understand you're panicking...
but digging into this matter is just
another form of fixation on Sidney.
Instead of it being how in love you are,
you're just getting
preoccupied with the dog.
When, really, this could
be a real positive.
What? How?
This is your chance to
break free from Sidney.
Now, I know how much you love Stevie,
but that dog is just a
reminder of the heartache.
It's impossible for you to move on.
Don't cancel your date with Emily.
In fact, this is great timing.
Go out. Have fun and see for yourself.
You don't need Sidney to make you happy.
Hey.
Come here.
Um, Lex?
Alexis?
- I hope you didn't think it was cheesy.
- Not at all.
Is that true about your father?
Unfortunately, yeah.
- Ooh.
- We're all set for Texas, by the way.
They didn't have any high-end hotels,
so I booked the closest thing.
Kinda like a Holiday Inn,
so don't get too excited.
No, that sounds great.
Oh, um, thank you for reading.
Means a lot.
Logan's been coming home crying
about how Spencer told him
that he can't be a part
of the Super Boys Club
unless he starts to dress and
act like the other boys.
Spencer made him eat sand the other
day to prove that he's worthy.
They also compared penis sizes
to determine who could join.
I mean, they're eight. It
sounds like a fraternity!
I'm sorry, but I can't tell
Spencer who to be friends with.
Well, you have to talk to him
about not forcing other kids
to do things that are dangerous.
Lindsay, have you spoken to Spencer
about disbanding this group?
They'll just find another way
to choose their friends.
We all know kids are tough at this age.
Sorry, can I interject here?
Modeling's a huge way that
kids learn to be social.
I mean, there are clear lines
being drawn, even here.
Jean, could you speak more to that?
Well, the truth is, bully or victim,
the feeling's just the same.
It's insecurity and fear.
And we've all got things
to be vulnerable about.
Fears of losing something,
whether it's your best friend
dropping you for the new kid,
or your husband...
having an affair with the waitress.
So, why don't we just be a little
bit more compassionate here
and less judgmental?
And maybe you should get Logan and
Spencer together for a playdate.
I mean, who knows?
That level of animosity might mean
they actually could be great friends.
I think that's pretty sound advice.
Lindsay, are you open to that?
- Oh, hey, honey.
- Hey there, hey.
- How was the PTA meeting?
- I killed it.
Oh, really? Look at you, power mom.
- I know, right?
- My, my, my.
All we have to do is get
Dolly signed up for soccer
and then you'll be a real soccer mom.
- How was your day?
- You know, whatever.
Coming up?
Yeah.
- Mommy!
- Hey.
- I learned how to crow.
- You did? Let me hear it.
Oh, my God.
That's incredible.
And Sadie's gonna be Tinkerbell.
Oh, well, I think you would
be the perfect Peter Pan.
Hey, Sweetie.
Do you wanna be part of
the Super Boys Club?
No. I think it's stupid.
You're right.
I think it's pretty stupid, too.
- I love you.
- I love you, too.
So, I just got done playing
my show at Rockwood,
and, uh, someone mentioned that you
were waiting backstage for me.
Hi, Paul. It's Jean.
Listen. I have to be away
on Thursday and Friday,
so, unfortunately, I'm
gonna have to reschedule.
So, can you call me back when you
have a chance? Thank you, bye.
Hey, you.
Oh, hey. Sorry, I was just
rescheduling an appointment.
Are you guys going away?
- I'll have some.
- Um, yeah...
I...
No. Michael has to be in Texas for work,
- so I figured I'd just hang with Dolly.
- Oh, thank you.
So, apparently, Darrell
has a new girlfriend.
I think she's like 14 or something.
- Or like 29, but still, man, it's...
- God.
Michael mentioned she
was younger, but...
Wait...
You guys knew?
Well, no.
He just said that Darrell was
texting with someone and...
Jean, if it was reversed,
I would've called you. I
would've called you immediately.
You're right. I was preoccupied. I'm...
- It's just a pretty big thing to forget.
- I know, I'm sorry.
Hey, I'd love to get your guys'
opinion on this situation.
- What's up?
- Whose?
My cheater.
Oh, I have your notes
on Allison, by the way.
- Oh, great, thanks.
- Thank you.
I now think there's a
lot more to the story.
I think he could be a sociopath.
I hate when people throw
that word around.
Yeah, but if the shoe fits...
In his case, it might be true.
He told me he sees a
blind man in the street
and enjoys watching him struggle.
Had to teach himself to
pretend to feel things.
Those are pretty big signs.
I wouldn't be so quick to label.
No, because you think all people
exist in a gray area. Don't you?
No, I just think, given
we're professionals,
we should reserve judgment.
Well, what's even more intriguing
is he tries to manipulate me.
How so?
Well, like when he told me
about cheating on his fiancée.
But I later found out he's
been cheating for years.
Maybe he's just not
ready to face it yet.
I don't know. I think people
need to own their circumstance,
and it's actually our job
to hold them accountable.
Right, but you can't
force a patient to be...
truthful with himself.
Or anyone, if they're not ready.
I think you're underestimating
the importance of honesty.
Hi.
Happy to see me?
How can I help?
What?
What, your colleagues don't
know you make house calls?
- That was extenuating circumstances.
- So what's the problem?
What do you want?
Jean.
Sorry, I...
Let's begin.
It's my fault.
I said I wouldn't talk to him
unless it was in front of you.
I'm confused why you're
seeing her at all.
You know, my buddy's a shrink.
- He sends his addicts to rehab.
- I'm not an addict anymore.
She still uses.
I thought you came here to try and
win me back, not be an asshole.
Why are you here, Tom?
She just told you.
She won't see me... without you here.
I guess she's scared.
Not normally big on therapy.
I mean, you're the ones that
are more fucked up than me.
If you're gonna be disrespectful,
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Tom.
I'm sorry.
I, uh...
You know, I act out when I'm angry.
You should be with me.
I mean, you know that, don't you?
Baby...
Hey...
I won't get all crazy.
Just come home already.
I miss you.
You know how good we can be together.
Allison, where are you living right now?
At a friend's on her couch.
Amber's a crackhead.
She's not a good influence.
And you are?
You're an adult, Allison, and you
can make your own decisions.
I don't think you're good for me.
Baby...
I don't think you're good for me.
- Hey.
- You heard her.
I think you should leave.
Are you okay with that, Allison?
Fucking joke, the both of you.
You think she cares about you?
I'm the only one who actually
gives a shit about you.
- Not your mom, not her!
- Okay, Tom...
And you? You're gonna get
what's coming to you, lady.
Just hope you enjoy the ride.
Michael Holloway's office.
Hi, Alexis. It's Jean. How are you?
I'm good. He's actually
still in with Allen.
Ah, okay, um...
Well, if he can't reach me, tell
him I'll be home after dinner.
- I'm just going into another session.
- Cool, I will.
Okay, great. Thanks.
Is this weird? I hope this isn't weird.
Honestly, I was a little surprised
that you wanted to meet up.
Why?
'Cause you and Sid, like, fell
off the face of the Earth
when you ran off together.
We didn't... I mean, we
didn't run off together.
Whatever.
I just feel like I'm finally
getting my life in order,
and you were really important to me.
Yeah, me too.
So, what happened with Sidney?
I mean, you didn't tell
me the other night.
Oh, um...
We were ultimately just too different.
That's all.
It's hard to understand the full
story from the outside, you know?
I mean, if you're gonna be a
barista into your late 20s...
it's just not cool.
I mean, she's still pursuing music.
Oh, come on. She's never gonna
be smart enough for you.
I don't mean to be rude, but...
she really fucked me over.
You did, too.
But I have made amends.
I just...
I think that...
she just sucked you in.
She's bewitching, but
she'll fuck you over...
when she's on her next obsession.
Can't believe you left work
in the middle of your shift.
Oh, whatever. You don't think it's
my dream to be a barista forever.
As long as I can make rent, I'm fine.
Plus, I have this demo thing which might
actually be the thing that takes off.
And what about your future?
- What do you mean?
- Well...
If things don't work out with
music, what's your backup plan?
Well, you can't plan for the future,
'cause you don't know
what the future holds.
Unless you have some crystal ball
you've been hiding somewhere
I don't know about.
That's not how people live.
I mean, sure, plans change,
but you have to have some
kind of direction, right?
Planning's a code for
making people feel safe.
It's not certain.
Nothing's certain, except for
whatever's happening right here.
In this moment.
That is real.
It's a tempting way to live.
It's the only way to live.
Well, you don't have responsibilities.
- Like what?
- I don't know.
House, kids, things that make
you settle down, be an adult.
Do you have those things?
I mean, you say all this like
you're living some encumbered life.
Your stories don't exactly track, Diane.
I mean, you're a single woman
in your 40s, I presume,
who works freelance.
You should feel completely free.
Well, I guess I just live
according to how I think I...
should.
Well, stop.
Stop thinking about what
everyone else wants for you.
'Cause, eventually,
they'll all fuck off.
And all you'll be left with...
is whether you were true to yourself.
- Don't stop on my account.
- Oh, no. No, it's okay.
You on, like, Tinder
or Hinge or anything?
No, um...
I'm actually not trying to jump
into anything at the moment.
Hmm.
I'm actually texting my therapist,
since you seem so curious.
You see a therapist?
That seems so unlike you.
Yeah, I know right? Well,
she's actually been...
really helpful through this breakup.
Feels like...
it would've been too
touchy-feely for you before.
Jean's different.
I mean, she makes it enjoyable.
She's, uh...
She's normal, like us, you know?
Is she cute?
Oh, what? You're jealous now?
- Please.
- I'm just curious.
I know you like those authority figures.
Actually, she's pretty.
- Really pretty.
- You are totally into her!
Jealousy's never been my strong suit.
Oh, I remember.
In CostaRica, you got in a fight
with that random woman who was
- showing us around the coffee plantation.
- You were totally flirting with her!
- I was scared for my life.
- Shut up!
Oh, my God.
Whoa. Hey, are you okay?
- Oh, God.
- Okay, whoa. Okay, just stand here a sec.
Okay.
- You all right?
- I don't know.
- I just feel dizzy, sorry.
- Okay, hey, can you walk?
Okay, we're just gonna walk
right over here. Yeah?
- I don't know what's happening.
- Sit right here. Right here. There we go.
- Okay, okay.
- I'm sorry.
It's okay, okay? Just
breathe, it's fine.
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine. I got you.
Just breathe, okay?
- I don't know what's going on.
- It's okay. Just take a minute, yeah?
Who's that?
Who?
- Diane? Look at me.
- Oh, God.
Okay, whoa. Okay, should I
take you to a hospital?
- No. No, I'm fine.
- Okay.
I just... I don't...
Just need a second...
It's fine. Take all the time, yeah?
Shh...
- It's Tom.
- What?
Tom. He must've... I
don't know, I just...
Okay, just rest a second, okay?
Okay, breathe. It's okay.
- You're fine.
- Oh, God.
- I'm scared.
- Don't be scared. It's fine.
It's fine. I'm here.
It's fine.
Can you... Could you call...
Call Michael, please...
- Who's Michael?
- And tell him I'm gonna be late.
Um, all right, well, what's
your passcode, Diane?
Diane?
I forget...
Three, six...
Okay, kid. Just rest
and relax a sec, okay?
I'll call later, okay?
It's fine. It's fine, okay?
Shh... shh...
