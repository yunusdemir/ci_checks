This road you're on,
you put yourself on this road,
on this exact night.
You chose this.
A man makes his destiny, right?
Nothing makes the gods laugh harder.
Treacherous roads out there tonight, folks.
We could be looking at 10 inches of
the white stuff by morning.
Temperatures here in the high desert
beginning to drop into the low 20s.
So take my advice, all you desert rats.
Grab a bottle...
Hey!
No, I hit the ditch going 60.
Ed? Ed, you there? Shit.
Ed? Come on, sweetheart.
You know, 50,000 miles, past two years,
without so much as a flat. You there?
Yeah, I keep cutting out.
Listen. I'm gonna be another couple hours.
I'll need you to drop in on Moreland for me,
keep the coals glowing.
He's talking about redoing
the whole mall in Knob Hill.
Christmas time.
Yeah, 5:30.
Oh, Ed, come on. I wouldn't be out here
in low rider central except to cover your ass.
Thank you. I love you too.
Listen.
Enrique, I've been on the road since 7:00.
I'm a salesman. I got a wife at home,
we got a baby due this week.
My wife gets really fucking nervous
when I'm held up.
Like I said, this evening at best.
Shit.
Any interesting diversions around here?
There's some cliffs about a mile walk.
Pretty sunsets.
Hey, Pete, wasn't it?
Listen. I got a contact in Phoenix
who's giving me a very sweet deal
on a fleet of retired jukes.
Wurlitzer’s. The vintage 1015s.
Classic Americana.
Fully refurbished.
Oh.
And they've all still got
the original 45s in them.
No shit.
You stick one of those babies in here,
you got the classiest joint
in a hundred miles.
I've already got a jukebox.
I'm talking about a Wurlitzer, Pete.
A 1015. 1-0-1-5.
Most popular jukebox model of all time.
People can't help but stuff them full of cash.
Looking around here,
I kind of get the impression you're a guy
who gives a shit about his place, yeah?
You got new pool tables,
bathrooms are very clean,
liquor's arranged just so.
A guy with his own sense of style.
So think about it.
Right there, a glowing tribute to
Presley, Otis Redding, Buddy Holly.
Guaranteed money magnet.
Says here you sell flooring.
Yeah. Right now I do, but in a few months,
I'm breaking out on my own.
To bigger and better.
No. What's with the reception around here?
Let me guess,
you've been expecting me, right?
Just closing up. Slow day.
No kidding. You mean it gets busy?
You'd be surprised.
So, how much for a reading?
Ten dollars.
A bit steep, isn't it?
I charge what you can afford.
Yeah, okay. Why not?
This doesn't involve killing any
chickens or anything, does it?
- Not unless you'd like it to.
- No.
No crystal ball?
It's in the shop.
Have a seat.
Now, the energy is stronger if I touch
your hand, but it's up to you.
Oh, hey, whatever, you know?
Just do your thing.
- What would you like to know, Mister...
- Starks. Jimmy Starks.
Oh, I don't know.
My car. Gonna make it home?
It will.
Just from touching my hand.
That's amazing.
What else are you picking up?
Roads.
Purple mountains.
A woman is waiting for you there.
She makes you feel 20 again.
Yeah. Yeah. What's she wearing?
A noisy mind,
cluttered with fears.
Strong ambition.
It's brought you trouble in the past.
Hey, how about them Wolves?
You think I should take the spread?
I wouldn't bet against them.
With Leavens on crutches?
Come on, forget it.
The kid's their secret weapon.
- Leavens will play.
- With a blown knee?
I doubt it very much. Nice try though.
I wouldn't bet against them.
Hey. I got a business venture
sort of hanging in limbo.
How's that looking?
That will require a deeper descent.
Gotta put up the big antenna, huh?
Okay.
- Your venture is secure.
- Oh, yeah.
You will benefit from a windfall.
A large sum of money coming to you
by way of Dallas.
Dallas? Well, I don't know anyone in Dallas,
but I'm happy to take it.
All sunny skies ahead, huh?
Chief? Hey!
Hey, you're breaking my hand here.
Hey, hey!
Hey.
What the fuck? Are you okay?
My concentration was broken.
I thought you were
having a coronary or something.
You sure you're all right?
Well, you know.
Just catch your breath a minute.
I'll get your stuff here.
I'm afraid the session is over, Mr. Starks.
That was 15 bucks worth?
I don't control the gift. I only listen to it.
Well, no offense,
but I've had better fortune cookies.
Part of the show, right? Yeah? Yeah?
That's good. You're good.
Like, another 20 bucks and maybe you
can summon the old vision back?
Come on, let's go again. This is great.
We're finished, Mr. Starks.
What?
So you're sore 'cause I spotted your game?
Come on. I'm a salesman, too, you know.
Maybe we can learn from each other.
At least give me my money's worth.
Okay.
What?
Strange way of doing business, pal.
Diamond in the rough, chief.
I'd work on your presentation a little.
The Emergency Broadcasting System...
...Estates.
Retirement for the new millennium.
Shit!
Yeah?
Somebody's casing the joint.
It's probably one of those auto dialers.
Lowest form of organic life,
the telemarketer.
Anyway, I'll call the phone company.
Oh, gees, you look good.
You should have seen me at bedtime.
Deej, I was stranded out there.
Sounded dangerously like a bar,
not a garage.
I was waiting in a bar.
Whatever.
I'm not launching an investigation.
I've got Jane Eyre for a lover, anyway.
I could have been a highway statistic
yesterday and you're giving me shit.
You drive too fast.
And you're always on the stupid phone.
Oh, damn, you look good.
Jimmy, don't. I'm showing a four bedroom.
All I said was you look good.
Yeah, well, you say that, then...
Hey, I was thinking,
that split second
before I almost became road meat...
Fuck you, don't even joke.
...how I'd miss the smell of your hair,
the soft curve of your neck.
How I might check out
without touching my angel one last time.
- You thought all that in one second?
- Yeah.
It's amazing,
this guy still thinks he's getting laid.
Hey, Jimmy, you up yet? It's Roy.
I got a little situation for you to handle.
It's Lopez.
God damn it, Jimmy!
You wanna know something about Roy?
Roy has nightmares
about giving me a gringo account.
He thinks I'm gonna pull up
in a cholomobile
with a 3-D Virgin Mary air freshener.
Roy may be a hard-on,
but he's one-tenth the asshole
than some of the guys
you're gonna meet out there.
It's a tricky game, Andy.
No one tells you when the rules change.
But you've got a hell of a future.
You know that?
Always been one of my sharpest guys.
Thank you.
Big dreamer though, huh?
- I got that from you.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Always looking for those shortcuts.
But, hey, what does it matter?
You know, this company is just one eddy
in a big old river.
I'm getting out myself in the next
couple of months.
- What do you mean, getting out?
- I got jukeboxes to sell.
Jimmy, what are we doing here?
Wait a minute. Wait a sec.
It's the audit, Andy.
Roy flipped about your expense sheets.
Shit!
Well, I can explain that.
We can explain that to Roy, right?
He's gonna understand.
Because of everything
that I had to pay for these last few months
with the kid coming.
And you practically taught me
how to pad my sheets.
You got nailed, kid. Not my rules, okay?
What do you mean, not my rules?
I don't understand.
Same guy that told me the rules,
"Fuck the rules. Don't worry about it, Andy.
- "It's okay. I'll show you the ropes. "
- I don't know that that's exactly what I said.
That's exactly what you said!
This is the same son of a bitch, huh?
- Shit, Andy!
- I can't believe you!
Andy, if it wasn't for me you would have
blown your fucking job a year ago, okay?
- Save that bullshit, gabacho!
- This is an expensive fucking suit!
- Fuck your suit! All right, pendejo?
- Nice.
Couldn't do it, Jimmy, huh?
You couldn't even take off the shades.
Get your hand off my car, Lopez.
Fuck you.
Damn.
Hey, Jimmy! Come on, where you been?
You're missing the game!
Are we losing?
This is how legends get started, right here.
Who could have predicted it folks, huh?
Mark Leavens' incredible comeback
from injuries
most thought would end his season.
Pass it in...
Defense! Defense! Come on!
This guy couldn't walk three days ago.
They were up by 12, like, what,
two, three, minutes ago, right?
Right? Come on.
What?
You shouldn't bet against
the home team, baby. It's bad luck.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
...is that it? Yeah? The other way around.
- Hey, guys! Ladies.
- Hey, Roy.
Catch them, Wolves?
Yeah. Yeah, $150 down.
Unbelievable, huh?
Hey Jim boy, come by the bar
when you get a sec. Okay, buddy?
- Yeah, okay.
- See you later, guys.
Hey, what? You know, he just wants some
advice from the... The oracle.
You know, the guru.
I don't need anymore of this.
I really appreciate you handling Lopez.
You know, a lot of guys turn a whining
pussy, you throw them a challenge.
Well...
- Here's to success.
- Success.
I had an interesting time down in Dallas.
That goddamn convention.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
I'm sitting in some little dive
somewhere, having a few,
and there's this jukebox in the corner
full of scratchy old records.
Just like those Waswizzlers
you've been talking about.
- Wurlitzer’s.
- Yeah, right, whatever.
Anyway, all night long I'm sitting there,
I'm watching people lining up
to stuff this thing full of money,
and then it hits me.
It's the intangibles,
just like Jimmy Starks said.
Well, nostalgia is a powerful thing.
I think we're gonna give your idea a whirl.
We'll maybe scale back a bit,
but who knows?
We could be sitting on a winner here.
Roy, shit. Man, this is great.
I mean, I've done the numbers.
This thing is... Real solid.
Did you say Dallas?
- Dallas, Texas. The selfsame.
- Yeah.
Come by tomorrow
before you hit the pavement.
We'll start working out the details.
Jimmy.
I thought I'd have to peel you off the ceiling
when I told you.
No, no, this is fantastic. I'm very happy.
Let's get it rolling, huh?
All right. Good man.
Can't they leave you alone on a Saturday?
Yeah?
You smell good.
Today? It can't wait?
Yeah, okay. I'll come in.
No, no, I know. Yep.
Everything okay?
Yeah, yeah.
It's just the check-up I had last week.
They did an EKG 'cause of my old man.
They said they saw a spike
or something on there,
wanna have a closer look.
- Do they think it's serious?
- Oh, no, no, no.
It's just, the machine's free and they
need another look, that's all.
- I'll go with you.
- No, it's all right.
- Okay. I'm gonna go home.
- No, no, stay here. It won't take long.
What we're looking at here
is a mitral valve prolapse.
- What the hell's that?
- Kind of a lazy valve.
Heart squeezes blood, valve doesn't close
all the way, some of it back-flows.
It's usually a benign condition.
Lazy valve? Okay.
So basically I'm okay?
You didn't see anything else?
We'll schedule you for another echo
in six months or so.
Keep an eye on that valve. But otherwise...
Come on, we'll go out this weekend.
I mean, I know the house needs work,
but it's 10 acres in Taos.
Yeah.
Relax, Jimmy.
I'm not picking out china patterns.
Hey, do you want to get us some ice cream?
- What are you, 15?
- Yeah. Come on.
- All right. Come with me.
- No, I'm gonna have a smoke.
- All right. What do you want?
- Chocolate cherry.
- Okay. I'll be right back.
- Thank you.
You are a hard worker, industrious.
An Aries, no?
No, Taurus.
Of course. The ridges
along the Mount of Jupiter tell the tale.
What about the...
You know, what do you call it? The lifeline?
Any way of...
Three bracelets of life.
Perhaps four. Very deep. Defined.
Is that good?
Seventy-five years at least. 100 at most.
Long life. Good fate.
What? What? What?
Mommy, this is broken.
I told you, stay in the other room.
Go on now, Mommy's working.
I am most sorry.
Let me ask you about fate.
Is that something that can be changed?
You know, like, if I knew something
was gonna happen, if I could see it coming,
could I...
Each life is a tapestry.
Some threads are woven tightly,
cannot be altered.
But others are looser.
With these we weave the story of our lives.
Thanks.
Thank you. Thank you, sir. Come again.
Bet you didn't figure
on seeing me again, huh?
Then again, maybe you did.
You going somewhere?
I like to do some fishing up at Abiquiu Lake.
Good this time of year.
I hear you.
Listen, about last time...
What about it?
Well, I gotta tell you,
when I first came over here,
I didn't buy it, the whole shtick.
- I gave you your money back.
- I know.
But certain things have happened.
Coincidences. You know,
stuff you couldn't have known unless...
I'm a performer, Mr. Starks.
A salesman. You said it yourself.
Yeah.
A performer doesn't stop
halfway through an act,
and a salesman
certainly doesn't give refunds.
Now, the Wolves game, this money my boss
promises me, out of the blue.
You knew that was coming from Dallas.
What are the chances of that?
A few lucky guesses. My gift to you.
That seizure thing you had,
what was up with that?
You see something or what?
Even if I could see things,
what would it matter?
Go live your life. Forget about all this.
Listen, I'm sure you've got some
code of ethics or something,
but I had a bit of a scare a few days ago.
My health. Is that it?
Good day.
Okay. I want another reading.
I'm not open for business.
I'll pay you double.
Come on, you're a businessman. Take it.
Am I missing something here?
What's the angle, old man?
You had your reading.
Now listen, you have no right
to fuck with people like this.
So I want another goddamn reading.
I saw no more roads. No more tomorrows.
Not much time left.
I'm sorry.
Is that right?
Well, how much time?
I may as well know, how does it happen?
The vision comes in images
and impressions.
I don't have the specifics you want.
One thing is certain.
You're safe until the first snow.
The first snow? Oh.
Well, shit, I guess I better pack up
and move to Florida.
What a fucking trip.
What carnival freak show
they fire you from, anyway?
We got a million square feet up for grabs.
What are you doing about it?
Garcia Brothers are out there
eating your lunch. Eating your future.
One square foot at a time.
- Jimmy?
- Jimbo!
He's dreaming jukeboxes, what can I say?
- Oh, sorry.
- Come on, guys, look sharp.
What's the story on Knob Hill?
You got a bite on this Moreland guy?
Yeah. Yeah.
You're shitting me.
Some trailer park Kreskin grabs your hand
and tells you you're toast?
Think about that, Jimmy.
We're always so sure
we're calling the shots in life. Right?
Maybe we're just playing it out.
What, like...
Like, I was destined
to order this chicken noodle soup, here?
You're out of my area here, Jimmy.
Ask any cop.
Obvious answer is usually the right one.
You got played.
I bet that was your first instinct.
Come on, admit it.
You wait. Next, he'll offer
to talk to the big guy on your behalf.
First, it's the hard-boiled eggs
under the pillow,
and then it's,
"Could you empty out
that savings account?"
I'm telling you, these guys are good.
- They're good. They get inside your head.
- He didn't even mention money.
Oh, come on, money? He's patient.
He figures you're not a superstitious guy.
He takes a lucky guess.
Luck doesn't explain
the Wolves game though, does it?
You think he didn't size you up?
Observe every detail?
He saw the Wolves sticker on your bumper.
Figured you had money on the game.
- Dallas. He knew about the money.
- He plays the percentages.
One guy takes the bait,
another 50 he never sees again,
and he leaves you looking under every rock.
Hey, you remember...
Yeah, I'll have a little more, thank you.
She's new... No, no.
Do you remember when we were kids we
used to play that game on the highway?
What was it? To see
how many red Volkswagens you could spot?
- Spud.
- Spud, yeah.
You see an awful lot of them
once you start looking.
You, my friend, are in a funk.
Take a day. Take a weekend.
Go away with Dee. Really. Let this go.
Let it go.
Yeah, maybe you're right.
All right, all right, good.
Aye, aye, aye. Jen. Jen!
Would you get him
some chili cheese fries or something?
He's eating a salad.
Don't ever serve him a salad again. It goes...
Fuck off.
Wow. Never mind that trip to Paris.
Champagne. And not a cigarette all night.
- I like this new Jimmy.
- Yeah?
Well, right now, this new Jimmy
would sell you for a cigarette.
Yeah?
Hello?
This is private property.
- Yeah, so is my mailbox.
- Excuse me?
Listen, I don't like the way
things went down either. Okay?
I think you got the short end.
I told that to Roy.
You're a saint, thank you.
Hey, I'm not the guy, Andy.
It was fucking management's decision.
One word from you
would have spared me from Roy.
So I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about, okay?
You sell me out for your jukeboxes,
and now it's keeping you up at night.
Well, tough...
Just don't come near my house again.
Okay?
What the fuck is that?
What?
You leaving little presents in my mailbox?
Hanging around the office like some
pissed off postal worker?
You're smoking too much yaho, gringo.
You need to get off that shit.
Hey, I'm not fucking around here, Andy.
Okay? The cops know.
- So anything happens to me...
- Who the fuck are you, eh?
Anything happens to me
and they're coming here!
Who the fuck are you?
Okay, I bust my ass to get work,
- and you're spreading false shit about me!
- You've been warned!
- I swear you ruin my name, Jimmy...
- Andy.
- What? What are you gonna do?
- What am I gonna do? Huh?
Yeah, what are you gonna do?
Okay.
Get out of here before I change my mind.
It stops now. Okay?
So how you been, man?
Oh, you know, still in the game.
- How's Katie?
- Oh, Jesus, it's been that long?
Oh, shit. Sorry to hear that.
- That's okay. We're both much better off.
- Good.
You got restrooms in this place?
Of course, why?
It looks like people been pissing on
your floors. Who the hell put these down?
Garcia Brothers.
Oh, God. Yeah, I know them.
Fucking bandits.
Yeah.
Hey, you'll never guess
who I ran across a few days ago.
Mrs. McClure. Vincent's mom.
She blacked out in Tabard's going
through the discount bins.
But she's one tough old broad.
Wouldn't let me call an ambulance.
I wasn't going to let her leave but she
told me Vince was waiting in the car,
and he's looking after her now.
- Vince is here? In town?
- Yeah.
I thought he was still in Oklahoma.
Yeah, I heard that too. Guess he got parole.
Hey, what do you think
landed him in Creedmoor, huh?
I heard some fucking stories.
I don't know.
- I guess you two don't...
- No, no. Not for a long time.
You guys ever get a chance to, you know,
square things up, or...
Nothing to square up, Tom.
He took his road, I took mine. End of story.
Yeah, yeah, I know.
The thing is, I'm sitting here in crazy traffic.
Yeah, I know.
It's like a tractor-trailer situation.
It's very ugly.
Next week sounds great. Okay.
We could be looking
at an early winter here, folks.
Get out those hats and gloves.
Oh, hi, Mrs. McClure.
I never thought I'd see you
on that couch again.
You and Vincent.
I remember when your feet
didn't touch the floor.
Sorry I woke you up.
I know you like your afternoon nap.
There'll be plenty of time
for sleeping soon enough,
if the doctors are half right.
Don't say that. You look great.
Still got a gift for the bullshit.
I'm dying, Jimmy.
Sorry, I...
So, what brings you around?
Well, I heard Vince was in town
taking care of you.
Who told you that?
Just a friend.
He runs the shopping center in Knob Hill.
Oh, yeah, that brat.
You know what they do
to old ladies living alone?
Especially ones with dizzy spells.
They ship them to the rest farm.
Oh, so Vince hasn't been around, huh?
Oh, I don't know, James.
No. Vincent's been doing real well lately.
He's got himself some construction work.
And he's off the booze,
and those goddamn drugs.
- I don't think he needs to dig up any...
- I don't want to cause trouble. I...
You should have looked out for him more.
He needed that.
Broke his heart the way things turned out.
- Well, we were young and stupid.
- You weren't stupid, Jimmy.
Excuse me.
You mind if I poke my head
in Vince's old room?
What?
Lot of memories here, you know.
You know where it is.
When did you say Vince was here last?
I didn't.
That'd be violating his parole, wouldn't it?
I got a good feeling this time.
Vincent knows
he won't have me around much longer.
First time in his life he'll be alone.
I made a full pot, just in case you wanted...
Jimmy!
- Hey.
- Hi. Remember the redhead?
The one that was at the end of the bar?
She's in the trunk?
Hey, so, I need you to take my calls today.
- This the new weekly ritual?
- No, no, no.
I'm swamped today.
And Roy's been getting service complaints.
- No, he is not.
- I'm not kidding you,
he asked me
if you were having personal problems.
Besides the fact that he tells me
that he puts 100 grand down
on a certain jukebox project.
That was your baby, Jimmy.
Yeah, well. That's gonna have to wait.
Can you cover me or not?
- Apparently so. What's up?
- Come on. I gotta take a trip.
It doesn't have anything to do
with a certain fortune teller?
No, no, no. It's personal shit.
- I need coffee, man, come on.
- Here.
I wanna talk to you. I don't want your coffee.
I gotta go.
Carlos is gonna call at 3:00,
so make sure you take it.
I'd like to talk to you for...
- I love you.
- Yeah, you know, let me ask you...
Would you characterize our thing here
as a close friendship?
Yeah. Close as two adult males
probably ought to get.
Yeah.
So as a close friend, I'd like to, you know...
I feel it my duty to voice
my profound concern over...
- Are you gonna cover me or not?
- These little...
No. No, actually I'm not.
You're not gonna level with me?
Don't snow the snowman.
Ed, come on. Hey, hey, hey.
Okay, listen. The target in my mailbox.
Lopez may not be the guy.
- Really? Wow. I'm sorry.
- Yeah, yeah, I know.
I think it's a valentine from an old buddy
who just got paroled from Creedmoor.
So you're gonna go down there
and fuck with him like you did Lopez?
- That worked out really well.
- No, he's not gonna know I'm there.
- It'll be reconnaissance.
- Reconnaissance?
Oh, what are you, a Navy Seal? Call a cop.
Call his parole officer.
Come on, the guy could be
a fucking nut job.
Yeah, exactly. So help me out, will you?
I'm hung over and... Ah, fuck it.
Get off the fucking road, man. Jesus.
Oh, wow.
Fuck! Fuckers locked me out
because I'm a day late?
Hey, fuck!
Oh, shit!
Shit!
Okay. Good. Thank you.
- Yes, I will let him know.
- Who's that?
Okay. Thank you.
That was the phone company.
You know the weird hang-up calls
you were getting?
Yeah.
Telemarketing computer.
They took care of it.
- They sure?
- Yeah, that's what they said.
Oh, good.
- Are you hungry?
- Yeah.
Good. Can you make us something?
Hello?
- I don't fucking believe this.
- How's it hanging, partner?
Who's this?
Come on, you don't know?
I'm hurt.
- Still there?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm still here.
- Who the hell is it?
- It's okay. Hang on a second.
- Hey, is that Katie?
- No.
Gees, another statistic.
- Hey, if you need a shoulder...
- It's a little late, Vincent.
Aren't you gonna ask me how I've been?
Yeah. How've you been?
Peaches, man. Thanks for asking.
- So how'd you like my setup?
- Huh?
My little joint here.
I'm planning a few home improvements.
But what'd you think?
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Maybe I got it all wrong.
First I hear you drop by to see Mom.
Next thing I see is that a New Mexico plate's
hauling ass out of my lot.
Yeah. You know, I did drop in
to see your mom. Yeah.
Good. You're the son she always wanted.
Maybe that Chevy was just a coincidence.
Yeah, you're probably all dandied
in a shiny Kraut-Cruiser by now.
- Beemer. Something classy.
- Not quite. No.
You know, I should come up
and check out your setup sometime.
Well, I thought you already had.
I got your little calling card.
Can't say I know what you mean, partner.
My PO's got my nuts in a vice.
You know, work, shit, sleep.
Almost had to wear those 24 hour bracelets.
Where are you calling from, Vince?
Home sweet.
Out on my deck with my cell phone,
sipping a drink by the in-ground pool.
Hey, this new girl of yours,
does she treat you right?
Let me guess.
Five foot seven, maybe eight.
Brown eyes and dark hair.
A little skinny, you always liked them unfed.
Am I close?
- Hey, partner, am I close?
- Yeah. Yeah, that's pretty close.
So then, things are going well, I take it.
Life panning out just like you planned?
- Look, Vince, what happened...
- Let's not go there, Jimbo.
Let's not trip down memory lane.
I'm trying to keep cool here.
Got my shirt off,
just trying to stay cool, baby.
What? Did you want to try
stitching up old wounds?
Is that why you came here?
You just got out of prison, Vince.
Think about that.
- You threatening me, Jimmy?
- Just stating a simple fact.
Hey, fact is, you broke into my place.
Listen, why don't we just keep going
our separate ways, okay?
Hey, you came looking for me, remember?
What the fuck
you trying to pull here, Jimmy?
You're really starting
to fucking heat me up here.
Vince?
Deej?
Deej?
Deej?
- What the hell are you doing?
- Did you open that window?
- Yeah, I opened the damn window.
- Don't open anything.
It's like a tomb in here! I can't breathe!
People get slaughtered in their beds,
for Christ sakes.
- What are you doing?
- I'm just taking care of this place.
I have to get up in four hours, Jimmy.
Fuck!
That's quite a sheet on your friend here.
So, this guy starts calling you out
of the clear blue, huh?
- After what?
- About seven years.
Must have been some falling out.
Any idea why he'd contact you?
No. No. No.
But I thought his mom might know.
So I went and saw her...
Well, wait a second.
You went to see his mother?
- Yeah, well, you know...
- Well, then you went looking for him.
No, no, no. I heard he was in town...
He must have assumed
that you wanted to get in touch.
- No.
- Wait.
Has this man actually made threats?
- It's more about what he's implying.
- Yeah, implying.
Well, since he's got a history,
I'll give a call down to his PO
and make sure they have an eye on him.
That's all I can do.
This guy had a pretty serious drug habit.
And I think he may be using again.
Do you have any evidence of that?
- Will you just hold on to it, in case?
- In case what?
Yeah, your Honor, that's the guy that
shot my friend. I don't even know this guy.
I told you, we ran a business together.
It turned to shit.
- What kind of business?
- A vending business. A vending business.
We routed stuff from an outfit in Mexico.
- I mean, it was sweet.
- In Mexico?
- The cash was great.
- Oh, what, were you laundering money?
Well, the feds showed up.
Oh, the feds showed up.
That's a minor detail.
Now six hours they...
Anyway, the guy said that
Vince laid it all out for him.
He suggested I do the same thing.
Did you do time?
Vince got three years.
The guy's a stupid fuck, you know.
He could have been out in a year
with good behavior.
You know, he goes off to prison
grinning like it's a joke.
Fuck him.
Yeah, fuck him. You're right.
He's got a gun,
he's got a junk kit under his bed. Exactly.
Fuck him. End this. Get this out of your life.
You don't need this stuff, I'm telling you.
Walk away from it.
You know, back in '86, I got nailed
for shoplifting a six-pack.
What?
I've gone down the criminal road.
I've been with you there, brother.
I'm going home.
Jimmy!
- What do you want?
- Hey, take it easy. It's just me.
Peace offering.
I thought we'd... You know...
Not for me.
Look, I'm an asshole, okay?
I do stupid shit, man.
My wife,
she always sets me straight later on.
Come on, what do you say?
No hard feelings?
Cool.
Listen, I'm trying to get back
on the straight and narrow, you know?
For my family.
You know how it is.
I just want to apologize, all right?
I mean, doing the whole target prank thing,
I mean, it was a stupid joke.
And I shouldn't have done it.
- What?
- The target prank.
I really do apologize, man.
Jimmy, I'm sorry, man.
Jimmy, are we cool?
Hey, Jimbo.
You're probably out golfing with the guys.
Catch you later.
Hey, they say it's gonna
fucking snow down here this year.
Can you believe that?
Hear that?
I'm pissing and pulling at the same time.
What they call ambidextrous.
You're not ignoring me, are you partner?
After all that initiative you took
looking me up.
Amigos till the end. Remember that one?
You just getting in?
Man, those hours will kill you.
So, how are the wheels of commerce
turning today?
Not too bad.
I played hooky myself.
Been lying here, just reminiscing.
Hey, Vince,
I want to apologize for
coming at you the way I did.
That right, Jimmy?
Yeah. Someone pulled a prank.
I overreacted.
Jumped to some crazy conclusions.
Like, who do I know
who's a convicted felon?
Yeah.
That's okay.
They briefed us on this kind of thing
in the release program.
A con's past is like quick sand.
The harder you try to pull yourself out,
the deeper you sink.
Well, I'm sorry, Vince.
In the system they preach responsibility.
You know, owning up to your own crimes.
Crucial step.
Most of the guys in the joint though,
wax fucking epic on how they got framed.
How so and so did it. Major fricking denial.
Now those guys, there's no hope for them.
You there?
Yeah, I'm listening.
I figured you came back
to take responsibility.
I'm not sure I follow.
I need to hear you say it, partner.
What went down in Oklahoma City.
- Vincent.
- Say it, Jimmy. For both of us.
I didn't sell you out.
See what I'm saying?
Till we fix this,
we'll be stuck at this moment.
Hey, listen, you had a chance to save
yourself, remember?
But you chose to walk
the fucking gang plank.
- With no help from me.
- You really disappoint me.
So I am not taking responsibility
for your fucked up life. Okay?
You got it all figured out. Don't you, Jimmy?
You ever lose an hour's sleep
your whole life?
- Face to face.
- I tell you, man, this is harassment.
You look me in the eye
and tell me that you didn't...
- And if it doesn't stop...
- What? What, are you gonna talk?
- I will call your parole officer.
- Are you gonna call me?
What will he do?
Make you pee in a cup.
Vince, I don't want this. Okay?
Let's just go our separate ways.
Oh, I don't know, Jimmy.
Smells kind of like a situation to me.
Coming up on 4:00,
time for your local weather.
Well, all you desert rats,
get those skis waxed up.
The heavy snows are blanketing
the Colorado Rockies
and are heading south
towards the Duke City.
I was saving all these
for the right occasions.
I guess there were plenty.
Just didn't seem so at the time.
- Maggie, I'm a little worried about Vincent.
- Oh, he's doing just fine.
I talked to him on the phone last night,
and kind of got the impression
he's thinking about
maybe doing something stupid.
Like what?
Well, I just think maybe if you called
him and talked some sense...
- I can't call him, Jimmy.
- Why is that?
He's gone to Cimarron
with his parole program.
Yeah.
They're digging ditches
for those flood victims.
Oh, ain't that sweet of him?
Damn, I wish I'd been awake
when he left the message.
Said he loved me.
Vincent don't say that much.
Getting real cold out there.
I better go. Thanks.
Jimmy, here.
Don't wait too long to open it.
How's this for a situation?
What am I supposed to think?
You're living your life
by what a fortune teller said.
Seems McClure failed to report
into his parole officer,
but with his type, this is fairly routine.
He's probably off on a bender somewhere.
So, you're not doing a fucking thing
until he comes here
and sticks a bullet in me, is that right?
Sir, there's no indication
he intends to cross state lines
or do you any harm.
Now, this is a routine situation
and we're checking into it.
Routine what?
He's coming here.
What the fuck's it gonna take?
Mr. Starks,
if you'd like to talk to a counselor...
I just want you to go in there by yourself
and tell the guy you want a reading. Okay?
It's easy. Just ask about the future.
You know? Anything to do with us.
Marriage, kids, whatever.
Marriage and kids.
That's... Used to make you...
If he says something's gonna happen to me,
don't freak out.
Just ask him what it is.
But the fucker has a problem answering
a direct question.
So you might have to lay on the tears or...
- Okay?
- Yeah.
Hey, the guy in the silver camper.
You know where he went?
Well, look who's back. The jukebox kid.
Hey, the fortune guy,
do you know where he went?
You know, I wanted to talk to you
about that Wurlitzer.
- I think we can cut a deal.
- You know where he is?
He comes and goes a lot.
Hey, Marcie, wasn't someone else in here
inquiring about the old man?
Yeah. He was chatting on about
fishing at Abiquiu Lake.
Guess it's good this time of year.
- Yeah. Okay.
- Hey, listen, about that Wurlitzer.
We gonna cut a deal or what?
Abiquiu is in three hours.
Let's just get a hotel.
This fucker's been on our ass
since Espanola. You notice that?
Vince could be anywhere by now.
- Just let him pass.
- Shit.
Where the fuck did you get that?
Put that thing away.
- Just get down. Get down.
- Put the fucking gun away.
That's classic, Jimmy.
What are you doing?
The old man said I was safe
until the first snow.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Jimmy?
Do what you gotta do. I'm going home.
Mr. Starks.
- Do you fish?
- Some fucking gift you've got.
You wanna tell me about it?
Because I don't know
what the fuck's going on.
You wanna talk to me?
- Nothing I say will matter.
- Oh, it might.
I won't use this. All right?
You shouldn't have fucking told me.
If you could try to see it as a blessing.
Oh, yeah, a blessing.
Think of those who never had a chance to...
To put things in order.
To say goodbye.
Fuck that.
I got a friend who thinks
that I screwed him over.
Now, if I knew what was coming,
if I knew what he was gonna do
then I'd get to stop him.
So I want you to tell me.
Your fate lies on whatever road you take,
even if you choose to run from it.
I'm not just gonna lie down and die.
I don't give a shit who's decided for me.
Oh, my God.
- Sir?
- Hey!
Clear skies in downtown Duke City,
despite some scattered flurries
earlier in the week.
But don't put away the skis just yet.
A massive cold front is building
north of the Sandia's,
which could mean up to 10 inches
of the white stuff by this weekend.
You left Deirdre
on the side of the fucking highway.
Does that sound like
rational behavior to you?
Same thing I told you this morning.
He was spotted on a security camera
two days ago stealing a vehicle.
- An APB's going out. He can't get far.
- What? What?
Rumor mill's working overtime, Jimmy.
We don't see you in here
for three days and people start talking.
Mr. Starks, he was last spotted near El Paso.
So basically, nobody's got a fucking clue
where he is or where he's going?
Now those folks down there are handling it.
And I'd appreciate...
I'm done with your bullshit, Jimmy.
I've had it.
I'm not covering for your ass anymore.
Hey, this is Deirdre.
If you don't know what to do,
I can't help you.
Hey! Is there a problem in there?
I just fell over. It's okay.
I need to hear you say it, partner.
What went down in Oklahoma City.
Say it, Jimmy. For both of us.
See what I'm saying?
Till we fix this,
we'll be stuck at this moment.
Your fate lies on whatever road you take,
even if you choose to run from it.
Jesus, Jimmy, where you been hiding?
- Got the feeling you were avoiding me.
- No. I'm right here, buddy.
Well, shit, the plan's all in tatters now.
Because of your little vanishing act.
What plan's that?
I thought you were up for a little reunion
at the old depot.
Have a few laughs. Reminisce.
Sure. Okay.
You're not setting me up, are you, Jimmy?
I'm counting on you not to fuck this up.
No, no, no. I'll be there.
Good. Tomorrow night.
We're gonna get things squared up.
I'm real glad you're coming.
Yeah.
Jimmy. Good to have you back.
Roy.
Everything kosher?
Yeah.
Cash for those jukeboxes
is sitting in North and Wells,
waiting on your lazy ass.
So I need half of it wired into this account
and the rest in cash.
Let's roll. Let's make us some money.
You sure you want to be
hefting that much around? I mean...
- Yeah.
- We could wire it, no problem.
No, it's gotta be cash.
These guys are ex-gamblers.
They don't trust us desert rats.
What do you want?
You gonna press charges now, too?
Wurlitzer’s. 1015s.
Most popular jukebox model in history.
I got 50 grand worth of them
paid for sitting in a warehouse in Phoenix.
Got the leads right here. What do you say?
I thought this was your big ticket?
Well, you know, I'm looking for a partner.
Someone to manage it for me.
Wanna think about it?
You're crazy, gringo.
Yeah. Yeah, I'll think about it.
Your name's already on the account.
You'll do great.
Jimbalaya, where the hell you been, man?
Oh, you know. Little touch of lazy valve.
Nothing serious.
Give me the usual.
One for my shoplifter friend
down the end, here.
- Good to see you.
- Likewise.
- I'm sorry I been such a...
- Asshole?
Asshole. Yeah.
You seem different.
Hey, you heard about those weather guys
that fly into hurricanes?
And they get to the center
and it's suddenly all real calm and still?
This where you're at?
Yeah.
- Means they're still in the storm, you know?
- Well, it's a good place to be, man.
Shit. No, you get nirvana, I get Espanola.
Hey, hey you wanna take a drive with me?
Come on, me and you.
- Cruising on the highway?
- No.
- No?
- You take it.
No? No desire, right?
- I'll see you tomorrow?
- Yeah.
- Hey, Sam, I'll clear out my tab.
- It's not the end of the month.
You're an amazing bartender,
you know that?
What?
I love your work, man. Just wanted to say it.
Get the fuck out of here, Jimmy.
- I guess you're back.
- Yeah. You could say that.
I just came to get my stuff.
My dad's sick again,
so I thought I'd drive up there and...
I'm glad you're okay.
This feels like some great affair.
You wanna go to Taos soon?
Take a look at the 10 acres?
Are you serious?
Yeah. I'm sick of this place.
- Don't go to Denver.
- Just a few days.
I'll be back before you know I'm gone.
You surprise me sometimes, Jimmy.
- Don't change your mind about Taos.
- I won't.
Okay, I gotta go.
It's gonna be okay, Dee.
Hey, Vincent.
You actually showed up without the cavalry.
Proud of you, Jimmy.
Sit down.
You...
Remember that time
my old man took us here?
Pretending we were gold prospectors?
Yeah. That was a good day.
Shit. Get all dressed up for me?
I'd have cleaned myself up,
but Four Seasons was all booked.
Have a drink, Jimmy.
Not too good to drink with me
these days, are you?
Hey.
Feels good to be back home.
You know, I still consider you
my best friend even after everything.
Friends like us,
that don't wear out like old tires.
I used to imagine,
you and me living next door to each other.
Wives would be best friends,
kids would play together.
Maybe even bring them here to pan for gold.
Why'd you have to fuck all that up?
Yeah. I wish I could tell you.
I mean, what were we looking at?
What, a year a piece in Stillwater?
We could have done that
on our fucking heads.
Shared the same cell.
Told jokes in the mess hall.
Dream up crazy shit for when we got out.
We would have been all right.
I suppose, you know,
that's none of your concern.
Not your responsibility, my...
My fucked up life.
Go on, Jimmy.
Give me one of your lines.
Sell me.
I did sell you out, Vincent.
I just wanted to get out of that
fucking room, you know?
It was so fucking hot. I just wanted water...
Did you ever think
of telling the truth, Jimmy?
In your whole fucking life?
No elaborate money laundering scheme.
No, just two stupid gringos
in over their heads!
You could have told them that
after you drank your fucking water!
I was fucking scared.
I've read it so many fucking times,
I got it memorized.
I'm gonna hire a lawyer, Vincenzo. The best.
I'm gonna get you out of that hell hole.
What happened to the plan?
No looking back. That it?
A man sinking in quick sand,
you don't kick him in the teeth, Jimmy!
You grab his hand and try to pull him out!
It's like my own mother.
You know, I go there...
I show up there two days ago,
and my head's hurting
and all I want to do is sleep.
And she goes and calls my PO!
She's dying, Vince.
- You shut your fucking mouth!
- She wants you to...
She wants you to go straight.
My mother ain't fucking dying!
Vince, Vince. I got 50 grand in the car.
I got 50 grand in the car for you.
We'll drive out of here. Yeah?
I'll take you wherever you wanna go.
Always a salesman, eh, Jimmy?
What, still trying to negotiate
your way out of a fucking scrape?
I'm not. I'm not, man.
Fifty grand. That's like tossing a Band Aid
to a guy who's fucking bleeding to death.
It's not a bribe, Vincent.
I wanna help you.
It's too late. I'm all bled out.
I've been trying, you know,
make things right for so fucking long.
It's been eating me up inside.
And then you show up out of nowhere
and it's like everything fell into place, man.
It's like it was all arranged.
Stand up.
Stand up!
Come here.
I had this
real prick for a cellmate once.
Rhodes was the guy's name.
And one time, after dinner,
Rhodes head butts his guard, grabs his. 38,
just like this one here,
and he's got the guard
pressed up right against him,
just like us right now,
and he's screaming in the fucking mess hall,
"Back! Back!
"I'm walking out of here or this pig gets it!"
So finally, the guards charge him.
And old Rhodesy, he pulls the trigger,
and the bullet goes through
both their skulls.
Ends up in a fucking dinner tray
100 yards away.
Asshole blew his own brains out.
Don't! Don't move. Don't, don't. Get down.
Get on your knees.
Jesus Christ.
I'd love to thank you for the stuff, Jimbo.
Ain't what I had in mind.
Me and you, partner. Two birds, one stone.
Butch and Sundance, out in a blaze of glory.
Hey, Vince.
We're gonna be some team
in the next world, you know that?
- Un-fucking-stoppable!
- Don't do this. Don't do this.
But we gotta stick together
from now on, okay?
- Just get in the car.
- No, no, no, no. This is better.
I'm not up for your thing. Are you ready?
- Don't do this. Vince. Come on, Vince.
- Are you ready?
- Vincent, Vincent, come on.
- See you in the next world.
- Come on, buddy.
- Vincent!
Treacherous roads out there tonight, folks.
We could be looking at 10 inches
of the white stuff by morning.
Temperatures here in the high desert
beginning to drop into the low 20's.
So take my advice, all you desert rats.
Grab a bottle, grab your sweetie,
and stay indoors tonight.
This is the Lone Wolf coming to you
on Graveyard Radio.
Live from the lovely plains of Moriarty.
This road you're on,
you put yourself on this road,
on this exact night.
You chose this.
A man makes his destiny, right?
Nothing makes the gods laugh harder.
Last night the heavy snow
claimed its first victim
out on Highway 14 after a delivery truck
lost control on the icy road.
Instantly killing the driver of a northbound
vehicle in a head-on collision.
The dangerous roads have also...
