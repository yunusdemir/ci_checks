<i>Previously on "Lights Out"...</i>
You're not the champ anymore.
<i>You walked away five years ago.</i>
<i>That's a long time.</i>
It's called chronic
traumatic encephalopathy,
otherwise known
as pugilistic...
Dementia.
I know what it's called.
How long?
Did you know that was
the I.R.S. in today?
Well, I'll tell you
what I told your brother.
Whatever they say you owe,
you just pay.
I'm broke, dad.
What?
It's all gone.
Some guy who comes by
the gym sometimes,
looking for muscle.
He have a name?
Brennan.
Hal Brennan?
But some dentist, I guess,
owes him some book money...
I'm not a thug.
Yeah.
So what do I have too?
Half a mil.
Cash is better.
You better get your
broken-down ass out of my house
before I knock it out.
<i>Six months from today,</i>
<i>"Death Row" Reynolds</i>
<i>will defend his title</i>
<i>one last time...</i>
<i>against "Lights" Leary.</i>
I know nothing ab...
Yeah. Don't bullshit me, okay?
But Johnny...
No. Please.
I will not
go through this again.
Nice sermon today, father.
Very nice.
I just got a text. Oh, my gosh.
It's from that new girl
at school.
Patrick, I hear redemption
is at hand.
How's that, father?
The rematch.
I'll be expecting tickets.
Well, don't believe
everything you read.
What shouldn't he believe?
Good morning, Theresa.
I hope we'll see Ava next week.
So do we, father.
Uh, Patrick, this time,
knock him out early
so they can't steal your title.
Father Moran already knows?
He probably saw Reynolds on TV,
the same way you did.
And you have nothing to do
with this?
And there's no fight?
So help me God.
Okay.
Can we get your brother
to issue a denial?
Well, I spoke to Johnny.
He thinks since the rumor's
already out there...
He wants to work it a little,
create a buzz,
maybe help me get
that commentating gig.
I'll talk to him tonight.
- Hey. Dylan.
- Theresa?
I still can't reach Johnny.
Daddy.
Daddy.
Can Dylan come?
Come to what?
Really, dad?
Her recital.
It's classic.
Right.
"Snow White."
"Sleeping Beauty."
"Sleeping Beauty."
Yes.
That's what I meant.
It's ballet, kid.
Lots of arms and legs.
Hey, Margaret.
Coffee, fellas?
No. We need a word
with your brother.
Johnny's not here.
Not Johnny.
The champ.
Hey, Lights.
What's going on?
I have no idea.
Can I help you?
Yeah.
Why don't we, uh, talk outside?
Can it wait?
It's a school night.
We're finishing up here.
Two minutes of your time.
You okay, son?
I'll be right back.
Let's go.
I got to pick up my son.
You pull this stunt
like this in front of his kids?
What kind of crap is that?
Go back inside, old man.
Hey, show some respect.
My partner meant no disrespect.
But this is a police matter.
It doesn't concern your father.
Pops, go back inside.
Tell the girls
everything's okay.
Not a word without a lawyer.
So what's this about?
No idea, champ?
Not a clue.
Then you got nothing
to worry about.
It's routine questions,
but this...
This isn't helping any of us.
Am I under arrest?
We can have this cleared up
in half an hour.
That would be a "no."
So I can go back inside.
You could do that, but then
we have orders to sit on you.
Follow you home.
Ask your local P.D. for help
with surveillance.
It's up to you.
Mommy.
Mommy.
Why are they taking daddy?
I don't know, honey.
It's okay.

- You okay? What's going on?
- Where the hell were you tonight?
Got my lawyer on the way down.
Call him off.
I got calls in to...
What? So it's nothing?
I said call him off.
It's two detectives
from Morristown
asking about
Saturday afternoon.
Oh, the dentist thing?
Did they mention
Brennan's name?
No.
They were fishing.
I don't think the dentist
is talking.
Well, who is, then?
Maybe some
of his brunch guests.
There were people there when...
Shit!
I told you it was a bad idea.
You came to me with this idea,
Johnny.
Yeah, 'cause you were
pissing your pants.
When the I.R.S. came in?
You remember?
Catch you boys at a bad time?
Mike Fumosa.
Not a good night.
So I heard.
Jersey city's finest release you
on your own recognizance?
They never held him.
Don't believe everything
you read on Twitter.
Okay.
So, Lights, what didn't you do?
I didn't punch a reporter.
Mike, there's nothing here,
huh?
The police were asking Lights
for his assistance
with a private matter
that the champ knew
nothing about.
Hey, come on.
Don't bullshit me, Johnny.
I've always been fair to you guys.
He cooperated.
They apologized
for the misunderstanding.
And since there is no story,
I'd appreciate it if you
didn't print one, because...
Can I tell him?
Our negotiations are at
a very delicate stage right now,
and something like this
could jeopardize the rematch.
Okay.
So it's on.
Lights, how about a quote?
You gonna fight Reynolds again?
The other side's made their bid,
but it's a process, Mike. You know that.
You've been out of the ring
five years.
You got to be a little worried...
Theresa?
I tried to call.
Hi, daddy.
What time is it?
Late, Daniella.
What are you doing up?
I was worried about you.
Don't be.
It was all a mistake.
That's what grandpa said.
The police were asking about
some kid at the gym?
Couldn't it wait?
I was supposed to talk
to them...Before.
And I completely forgot.
You forgot you were supposed to
talk to the police.
Go to bed, sweetheart.
Okay.
Good night.
Your mom asleep?
Uh, yeah, I think so.
How mad was she?
Couple of chardonnays.
Good night.
♪ Trouble in the air ♪
♪ trouble all I see ♪

Hiding?
Wiped out.
How's Katie?
How did you feel the first time
you saw <i>your</i> father arrested?
Like I'd never see him again.
And I wasn't arrested.
You okay?
Never been better.
I'd like to know
what's going on.
It's not good.
A couple of people
in Morris township
say I crashed their brunch
Saturday
and broke their host's arm.
What?
Who?
Some dentist named Roger.
W-why would...
The police aren't...
How... How could they...
They get a call,
they have to follow up.
Well, did you tell them
you were just on TV,
that that's when these people
come out of the woodwork?
Mm-hmm.
I mean, it's... it's insane.
Why would you something like...
They know I don't have
a motive.
But they also know
I don't have an alibi.
I was out running.
***
No.
You were with me.
With me and your father.
Leave him out of this.
He...
He was weak
after physical therapy.
We spent the afternoon with him.
I checked his blood pressure.
You two watched TV.
I cleaned.
Okay?
Okay.
So take it from me,
the champ...
If you want a knockout deal...
On carpet or remnants...
Come see Carl,
the Monmouth County Karpet King.
And cut.
So we're done?
Excuse me.
Oh.
Sorry about messing up
those lines.
Didn't get much sleep
last night.
You should go see my brother.
He's the mattress king.
Listen, before I go,
can I get <i>your</i> autograph?
Mine?
Oh. Of course.
My wife said to make
the check out to your manager.
Actually, just to me is fine.
I need a lift.
What happened?
You tell me.
They're towing the car.
I just had it checked out
last month.
Is it the electric?
They say they're repossessing.
That's got to be a mistake.
I'll call Johnny.
Okay. I'm outside the school.
On my way.
♪ Troubles came a-callin' ♪
♪ like they did before ♪
Where to?
Straight to the hospital.
It's too late
for the conference.
So what happened?
Johnny says it's a screw-up.
It's all automatic payments.
He must have put the money
in the wrong...
Are you kidding me?
How hard is it to put the...
We'll have the car back
in a day... two days, tops.
Why didn't they call?
Who?
The bank.
The money we've parked there,
they can't give a heads-up?
Johnny's into it with them.
And the dealer?
They just come and take a car without even...
It's not the dealer.
It's their finance arm.
Overreacting.
Everyone's jittery these days.
Everyone's jittery.
For five long years...
I've listened to Patrick Leary
claim he won the fight.
The rest of the world ***.
Now, for those same five years,
he's refused my offer.
<i>My... my generous offer,</i>
<i>my magnanimous offer</i>
<i>to get into the ring and fight</i>
<i>for what he claims was taken</i>
<i>from him.</i>
Man's got a point.
Hey.
Champ.
Omar, get back to work.
My own gym,
I got to listen to that?
No jail can hold you?
What'd the bulls want?
My autograph,
by the end of the night.
It's another shakedown,
like the Vegas girl.
Then, uh,
you better get rid of this.
I found it by your locker.
You know, guys like you,
they've always got a target
on their back.
I know, dad.
Johnny in a good mood?
Am I your brother's keeper?
Hey, listen.
You got a minute?
I need your help
with young blood over there.
He's working so hard,
his shadow went down.
But I'll tell you something...
Three or four fights,
he's got a shot at the title.
Not now, dad.
Yeah. Well, you know what?
You <i>should</i> be sorry.
Yeah. You damn well
better take care of it.
Don't shit where I eat.
Sons of bitches.
How many cars have we leased
from those thieves?
You know, where's the courtesy?
How far behind were we?
Margin of error.
I told Theresa we'd have
her car back by tomorrow.
That's a push.
They're asking for
the first few months prepaid.
Has Brennan paid up yet?
I'm working on that.
Thing is, now that the police
are investigating,
we can't accept his check.
Even Brennan needs a few days
to get that much cash.
Give me his number.
I'll get it.
We're not calling him.
Not on our phones,
not on our cells.
What about the bingo money?
I.R.S. garnished it.
What?
From now on,
we're cash in, cash out.
No more banks.
Which reminds me...
I got to get that carpet check.
I deposited it.
My account.
Then the I.R.S.
got that, too.
What can we get for the ***?
That's your dream, baby.
We're not selling it.
How much?
It's not the time.
You know that fund
that helped us refinance?
They're lifo.
Come again.
Last in, first out.
If we paid it off now,
they'd get paid, and we'd get...
Screwed.
Hey, it's all
gonna turn around.
We just got to stay
on our feet.
You know, one of these days,
when we cut the ribbon
on this thing,
we're gonna sit back
and we're gonna laugh...
Gus.
Give me five more dollars
of scratch-offs.
Feeling lucky today?
Every day.
Brennan coming by?
Not usually.
He don't like to get his hands
dirty no more.
Do do me a favor, will you?
Leave word for him.
Listen,
I can take book for you.
It's not like that.
It's personal.
Pick it up. Pick it up.
Nice. Nice. Come on.
Over here. Nice work.
All right, guys. Come on.
Work it out. Good job.
Let's go.
Come on.
Pass it out.
Pass it out.
Good job, guys.
Come on. Come on. Good job.
Nice. Nice!
Come on.
Good job.
Come on.
Good! Good! Good!
You covering girls' soccer now?
Beats being a leg breaker.
Excuse me?
Oh, no. You're right.
It was an arm.
What I don't get...
Why would you hurt someone
without even getting paid
for it?
Me, I don't write a postcard
on spec.
Didn't I used to protect you
in high school?
I should have let them flush
your head down the toilet.
Them? Really?
Oh.
Well, let me protect <i>you.</i>
<i>The story's getting out, champ.</i>
You need to get ahead of it.
And I can help.
Uh-huh.
I'm serious. Talk to me.
I don't want this getting
in the way of our comeback.
Ours?
Think boxing's gone bad?
Try <i>writing</i> about boxing...
for a newspaper.
Dad!
Dad!
Get lost.
I hear there's a dodgeball game
down the street.
Did you see me play?
Yeah.
Who's he?
No one.
Promise me you'll never date
a reporter.
So does this mean I can date?
No.
Dad.
Dad, what are you looking for?
The car.
It's right there.
I knew that.
You don't get dizzy
spinning around like that?
No.
Watch this.
This is the end.
Brava!
Brava.
Take a bow, Katie.
Take a bow.
Time for a bath, little one.
Five more minutes?
Now, please.
- Mom.
- No guff, okay?
Mm.
You have a visitor downstairs.
Who?
Daniella didn't get
his badge number.
Get your coat.
We're gonna go for a ride.
Hal Brennan.
I understand you've been looking for me.
Velez, get us some coffees, huh?
From his sister's diner.
You can...
You can walk from here.
Small world.
I grew up in Newark.
We <i>have</i> crossed paths.
I saw you fight a dozen times.
Vegas, A.C., and then,
you know, Detroit.
Yeah.
I thought I recognized you.
That last one...
You were robbed.
Long time ago.
Ah, not so long.
I used to come here
when I was a kid.
<i>That</i> was a long time ago.
I'd look at those lights,
I'd think, "someday...
Someday..."
I want my money.
Sometimes direct is good.
Sometimes it shows desperation.
Don't...
Don't show desperation.
Here's a taste.
Where's the rest?
I figured, with your profile,
this dentist would wet himself
when he saw you.
The thought...
the <i>thought...</i>
was to imply violence,
not resort to it.
At least not in front
of people.
Just trying to do the job.
It's this profile of yours...
Makes some people
want to test you,
show they're a man
by taking the champ down.
Like these detectives
up in Morristown.
Now, they got a hard-on
for you.
Nothing you got to worry about
on my end.
Well, I appreciate that.
Even so, I'll feel more
comfortable when this goes away.
So will you,
and so will your family.
I'm listening.
I may know a guy
who can put this to bed.
I'll get the details to your brother.
- I'm not doing any more jobs.
- No, it's not like that.
My guy has a sweet tooth.
You'll drop off a treat,
and none of this ever happened.
And then I get paid?
Whatever's left over, son.
Whatever's left over.
Hey.
I'm too old for this.
That makes two of us.
Just a couple of rounds.
I'm working on his defense.
Uh, look.
He likes to get cute.
Make him work.
Take it to his body.
Mm.
Okay, pops.
Try not to have a heart attack.
All right.
Let's go.
Good.
Look at this. Look at this.
There they go. Let's go.
Let's go.
Give it to him.
Get closer.
Let's go.
Hey, nice.
Like that.
Come on, champ.
Yeah. Yeah!
Let's go!
Give it to him!
Defense.
Omar, defense.
Throw a haymaker there.
Come on!
Hey. Cut the shit, Omar.
Focus on defense!
Hey, hey.
That's enough.
Nice, kid.
Get out of there.
Come on. Move.
Move.
Protect yourself.
Omar, use your elbows.
Cover your body.
Hey, hey.
- Hey, enough of that, now.
- Hey, come on!
Defense.
We're concentrating on defense.
- You kidding me?
- Good shot, baby.
Back on top, champ!
Show him what you're
working with!
Get him back!
That's enough.
That's enough!
Damn it, I said that's enough!
Break it up! Break it up!
Both of youse!
Locker room, Omar.
What'd <i>I</i> do?
Now.
Proud of yourself?
Your kid's reckless.
He's just a kid.
You should know better.
You don't want to help,
just say so.
Don't worry about him.
He'll get over it.
Clean yourself up.
Let's get some lunch.
What happened?
Your brother's an animal.
Took one of dad's protégés
to school.
You should've seen him.
He hasn't lost a step.
Did you enjoy yourself?
Little bit.
He looked good.
- Don't tell Theresa though.
- Aah.
What happens in *** stays in ***.
Which reminds me...
A reporter friend of yours
was nosing around here
about the other night.
Mikey Fumbles?
I don't know.
Ugly guy?
Not for a writer.
Everything okay?
How's the pea soup?
Lumpy and thick,
like the two of you.
Here.
Enough to get the car back.
I told you to stay away
from Brennan.
He made a house call.
Now he wants another favor.
Friend of his called me
this morning.
Some councilman
out in Morristown.
Said he's having a birthday
party for his kid Sunday.
Wants to know
if you can come by,
maybe take some pictures
with the kids,
give a few boxing lessons.
This Sunday?
Oh, it's Katie's recital.
Told him it was unlikely.
What time?
3:00.
An hour, tops.
He didn't mention a fee,
though.
There won't be one.
It's for a good cause.
Something else.
I'm supposed to pick up a cake
on Saturday,
take it to the party.
Some bakery in the Ironbound.
All he said is his kid's got
a sweet tooth.
I'll take care of that, too.
You want to tell me
what's going on?
It's all good.
Here you go, champ.
It's on dry ice.
No need to refrigerate.
These are great.
Mm.
How much for this?
On the house.
Really?
Thanks.
Knock 'em dead.
Hey, mom.
Why aren't you
on <i>your</i> computer?
Oh, Ava says my typing
bothers her.
What, through the wall?
Yep. That's our Ava.
Yeah.
You know, you should take a
break once in a while, sweetie.
Yeah.
It's just this term paper.
I really need to get it right.
Yeah.
Of course you do.
Love you, honey.
Love you, too.
I must be the only mother
in New Jersey
who worries that her daughter
studies too much.
Daniella?
Yeah.
She didn't get that
from my side of the family.
Meanwhile, Katie's so excited
about the recital.
She took forever
to go to sleep.
That reminds me.
Margaret's gonna pick you
and the girls up.
I'll have to meet you there.
I got an appearance thing
tomorrow.
A quickie.
Won't conflict.
Why would you book that?
It's more of a favor.
For your brother?
It's no big deal.
I don't have my car back yet.
Margaret's always late.
She won't be late.
Call them up. Please.
Cancel.
I can't do that.
Of course you can't.
Why would you do anything
your wife asks you to do?
All I've ever done
is what you've asked me to do.
This house. Three kids.
No career.
My choices?
You want to go there
after this week?
After <i>this</i> week?
My choice to have cops
take you away twice
in front of your children?
You want to tell me
what the hell is going on,
or you want to go back to lying,
like the old days?
Saved by the bell again.
The kids will get it.
Daddy, it's grandpa.
It's not a good time, pops.
What?
When?
How long ago?
What happened?
Nothing.
Well, did he fall?
He's okay.
Well, go.
- You sure?
- Of course. Just go.
Okay, pops.
I'm on my way.
Yep.
Thank you.
Sorry about calling
the old man.
It's just you weren't returning
my calls, and I'm on deadline.
- <i>C'est la guerre.</i>
- Mm.
Um, so, how do you know
the dentist?
I don't.
Look, the lawyers
don't want me talking.
Can we go off the record?
<i>I</i> wouldn't,
'cause, I mean...
Hey, what's up, champ?
Hey.
How you doing?
I'm good, man.
I seen all your fights.
Oh, yeah?
Thanks, bro.
Good luck, man. Good luck.
Thanks.
Look, it's...
No quote makes you look guilty.
You remember that fake
paternity suit in Vegas...
Right after my first big purse?
I'm celibate, 2,000 miles away.
That couple came out
of the woodwork.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Heat-seeking missiles.
So you're saying
this is another shakedown.
I've got three
beautiful daughters,
more money than I can spend.
Why would I risk that?
Right.
Right, right.
Why would anybody?
Hey, it's all squared away, dad.
You did good to call me.
No, I don't think he's gonna run
with it.
Hey, listen,
if Theresa says anything,
you took a fall tonight, okay?
Thanks.

Rumours of a Lights-Reynolds rematch
is really really gonna go
into the ring?
With 5 years of rust on 'em?
Right, well it wouldn't be
the first time the I.R.S. would um...
push an aging heavy weight
back into the game.
<i>But in this case, there may be</i>
<i>some serious legal issues</i>
<i>which could be a block</i>

<i>Come on.</i>
<i>I tried to get a quote</i>

- <i>he shouldn't speak on the record.</i>
- <i>Dad?</i>
In here, sweetheart.
Hey, can we, um...
Can we talk for a second?
I got to get ready
for an appearance.
How long have you known?
What?
Pugilistic dementia.
What are you talking about?
It's all over
your search history.
And you had a cat scan
last week?
Where'd you see that?
Your calendar.
The appointment was hidden,
but you never locked it.
Do I read your diary?
I'm not hiding anything, dad.
How serious is it?
The neurologist said it could go
a hundred different ways.
Do you have any symptoms?
Disorientation. Headaches.
Anxiety.
That's from raising
three daughters.
What does mom think?
You haven't told her yet?
Dad, she's a doctor.
She should know.
She's not a doctor yet.
She's working hard
to become one.
But she doesn't need to worry
about this right now.
Okay?
But seriously, dad...
Daniella...
You should tell her.
No matter how much smarter
or tougher your mother is
than me,
I'm still the only one
she's got to lean on.
Can we keep this between us...
for now?
Please?
Okay.
Hey, mom, where's dad?
Oh, he's on his way, baby.
Okay.
We'll save that one.
Yeah. Yeah, that'd be great.
I'm excited!
Everything comes off the jab.
You keep your left hand up,
like this.
Hit him like he stole
your lunch money!
Are you ready to box with the champ?
Yeah.
- Come on. Let's go.
- Don't hurt him, now, Ryan.

Wait.
Uh, see that kid out there?
Stanley, come here.
Nice kid.
A little shy.
Not a problem.
He's the D.A.'s stepson.
I'll be sharing the cake
with his dad.
Hey, Stanley.
I'm Patrick.
I got a present for you.
He's got a present for you!
I'm gonna sign this glove
for you.
But I want you to keep it.
Don't sell it someplace.
This is to remember me by.
That's for you.
Nice to meet you, Stanley.
I'll see you around.
Thank you.

I thought he was better
in "Puss in Boots."
I screwed up.
I thought the thing was an hour later.
I'm sorry.
Daddy, daddy, daddy!
Did you see me?
You were perfect.
Katie, you were amazing.
Losing track of time is a symptom.
But sweetheart,
I was never good with time.
Look, I'm your dad...
and I'm telling you I'm fine.
I'm ***.

Officer Velez...
Bad time?
Sorry to interrupt, our captain...
wanted us to come down personally
to inform you that
- the investigation has been dropped.
- Honey, what's going on?
What?
Your husband was a victim
of a false allegation, Mrs. Leary.
We're sorry for any inconvenience
we may have caused you last week.
Inconvenience? Is that what you call it?
Honey, why don't you let the
girls know everything's okay?
It is, isn't it?
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
Okay. Sorry.
Thanks for coming
all the way out here.
Good night, officers.
You have a nice family.
Thank God that's over, huh?
