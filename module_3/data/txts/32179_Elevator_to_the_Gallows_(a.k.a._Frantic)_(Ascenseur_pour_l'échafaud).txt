I can't take this anymore.
I love you.
Hey, do you love me?
I love you too.
We can't be apart anymore.
So we need to finish it.
Okay.
Useless.
Love makes a
person become weak.
Stupid.
What's the time now?
4 o'clock.
The Colonel should be there now.
Meiko.
Look, I'll say it again Tokito-san
That woman is bad news.
Colonel.
Here's a present from the witch.
I will wait for you
at the usual place.
Please come when you
have finished the job.
I will sit near the window.
And we will both
be together forever.
Forever.
"Elevator to the Gallows"
On November 13th,
The Minister of Defense is coming.
They will take a private
jet to Haneda Airport.
And they will drive through Yokohama
To attend the welcome party.
The police will all be on duty
and maintainig security.
Mr. Tokito, you always
look so smart.
Are you busy today?
Not many customers today.
Your hair's gotten longer.
You should cut it.
Come see me when
it grows 1 mm longer.
You're welcome anytime.
Don't go anywhere else.
(City Tower)
I've heard about you Dr. Tokito.
You're playing leapfrog.
You reported the
hospital construction
planning to officials.
I know a bit of everything.
Providing a complete
health care system
to developing countries
for free.
I can understand.
This is your sense of duty
as a doctor.
But the higher-ups
won't understand.
Unlike tending to scars
during peacetime.
our group prefers the
profit of war.
You shouldn’t say that
so casually.
If you don't
want to make a profit,
then stick to volunteering.
You are from an
International Hospital.
But no one will go
to a place like that.
They're full of sick and
injured people.
Though I really
admire such people.
Good luck.
Welcome back.
Nobe called several times.
He wants to talk with you
about the condition of a patient.
Okay.
(International Medical
Volunteer Organization )
I visited your hospital
a few days ago.
There aren't many
doctors or nurses.
This document is very detailed.
Kentarou, this isn't
enough to be used as evidence.
Old Imperial Hotel.
Central Museum of New York.
Frank Lloyd Wright is
very famous in America.
This is another work
of Frank Lloyd Wright.
I'd make it into a high class
hotel if it were up to me.
I will not sell this building.
Temiyako, we've done a lot of
quesstionable things together.
From small transactions
after the war.
To selling things
in Vietnam.
And land development and aquisition
during the bubble economy.
We've always done stuff
like that.
What's going on?
This is full of mistakes.
I will not sell this
building no matter what.
It's my legacy.
I'm sorry, please
let us check your bags.
Bastard.
Shithead.
Stand up.
Who the hell is this guy?
Who knows?
He just jumped on me.
Why is he so full of himself?
He's nothing but
a patrolman.
What are you doing?
You think you're so brave.
Don't stop me.
Stop.
Bastard.
Bastard.
The boss will be very happy.
Akagi, are you alright?
Temiyako will take a flight
to Shanghai today.
He will stay in his office
alone before departing.
Because the Minister of Defence
is coming into the area
from the highway and
crossing over the Boulevard
and passing Japan Boulevard.
Traffic control is needed.
There will be almost no
cars or pedestrians
around the
Temiyako building.
The restrictions will
start at 5pm.
Holding a call from Nobe.
Put it through.
Hello.
Hello, this is Nobe.
Sorry to disturb you.
What I'm calling about is,
There is a
patient called Makino
you treated him yesterday.
He passed away
in the afternoon.
Really?
As I expected,
The deceased's family is now
here to make trouble.
They said the
cause of death
was excessive use
of anticancer drugs.
They are convinced this is
the doctor's mistake.
It's not looking good right now.
They said they have a
relative who is a lawyer.
Okay, I got it.
I will go there and
take a look next week.
Ms. Takakiwa.
Here.
I need to write a document,
please hold my calls
and report them to me after.
Okay.
How much time will you need?
What?
According to the
president's orders,
the electricity is to be cut off
after 5:30pm on weekends.
15 minutes.
Okay.
Only 15 minutes.
Just pretend to be a cleaner
if you are seen.
Don't worry.
Let's continue next time.
We can finish over a meal.
I need to attend the
welcome party later.
I'm not going later.
I'm tired.
And I am not free
to eat with you.
No worries,
everything's gonna be alright.
Someday,
we will be together
somewhere
no one knows.
You're back?
Tokito.
I know human experiments
are a violation of human rights
and you're not happy
You saved my life 7 years ago.
I'll always remember that.
I've been through every
obstacle until now.
But this is the first time
my man is pointing a gun at me.
Really horrible.
Why are you doing this?
What do you want?
(The agreement
of fund donations
for Ethiopia
Hospital Construction)
1.2 million dollars?
Okay, I will give
you another 1 million
Use it to build
a big hospital.
For those who are poor.
Let's work hard.
I have signed it.
You can do whatever you want.
It's a great undertaking.
Bring Meiko along too.
I know.
Always talking
about medical theory
but fooling around with
your lover secretly.
Actually you just
wanna have fun with Meiko.
They took my gun.
Kill me.
Don't say that.
Does it hurt?
Freeze.
That guy should be
somewhere around here.
We should leave now.
Dr. Tokito.
Dr. Tokito.
Was that 15 minutes?
You need to stop now.
You forgot that they will
turn off the power soon.
Really?
Okay, I'll finish up.
Okay.
No more excuses.
What are you doing?
Make the call.
You worked hard.
Thank you. You too.
Ah, Ms. Takikawa.
Anyone on the 5th floor?
No one.
Have a nice weekend.
You too.
Dr. Tokito.
Who?
My customer.
My first customer
when I became a hair stylist.
Whose is it?
A patrol officer.
Cop?
Police know how to
trace things.
Take him to the hospital.
Everything makes me worry.
Okay.
Thank you.
Power off.
You will be fired
if you don't get back to work.
Shh!
7 mm.
Gun of a cop.
This is a treasure.
That's my gun.
What?
Phone.
Wait for me.
What are you
doing? This is illegal.
Shut up. Get in the car.
Hurry up.
Get in.
My hand is injured. It'll be
hard to drive.
Others will know you're a cop.
Put the roof up.
What?
The car roof.
There's a switch here somewhere.
Cool.
I get it.
You wanna get your gun
back, right?
Then you can get a
promotion.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
There are 2 types of desserts,
New York cheesecake and. . .
A woman in the car.
Who is she?
Don't answer!
Don't.
Throw it away.
You didn't shoot?
Or you did?
Did you?
Eh? Madam?
Long time no see, I'm Izumi.
Is it okay that you didn't attend
the Defense welcome party?
Of course, I wasn't invited.
Are you meeting
up with the president?
Or...
I know about it.
You and Dr. T.
Meiko-san.
You wanna be my
enemy or my friend?
I always go to this place,
I'll wait for you there.
(Yokohama Seaside Hotel)
Dr. Tokito
must be really angry.
Leica M2, I wanna get one of these too.
The shop we went to sells it.
Not interested.
Why are you acting like this?
Weird.
Director, International
Medical Volunteer Organization,
Dr. Tokito Takahiko.
Dr. Tokito has
worked in a war before.
This camera followed him.
A rich volunteer.
Who cares?
Put it back.
Stop it already.
You know him?
This is interesting.
Are you lost?
No, I'm looking for someone.
Who?
I don't know.
You can't find someone you don't know.
Yes, you're right.
I know, you're searching
for someone you love, right?
Yes, someone I love very much.
Why don't you go to the cops? When you
want to find someone you should ask the cops.
Tracy, come here.
The number you have dialed
is not in service or is off.
Oi! You okay there?
Just married? Don't mind me.
Welcome.
I've reserved a room
here, my name is Kami.
I wanna reserve one more room.
Certainly, please wait a moment.
So annoying.
What's your name?
Tokihito.
I'm Tokihito.
How do you write that?
It's okay,
everything is going well.
In one month.
We will be in a
totally new country.
We won't be apart anymore.
One more.
Don't take any more.
Too bad, no more film.
Wait a minute.
I see.
You're Sakumi's ex-boyfriend.
You even followed
us here just
to get her back.
Young, really good.
Sorry that my men
made trouble for you.
You're really awesome.
But it seems like you're
in the wrong career.
You'll be fired if
you don't have this.
If you're willing to work with me,
I will cover for you.
How do you feel about that?
Give it back to me.
Do you mean the gun?
Or...
We're finally in Hakone.
I wanna go to the spa.
You two work things out
while I'm there.
What? You don't trust him?
No, I do.
But.
What should do?
He saved me in Bosnia before.
He would rather die than
betray someone.
Even a crazy woman like you.
You don't have to worry
about this one anymore.
Just tell me his name.
Izumi.
I'm feeling better,
thank you, Taisa.
Hey, hey! That's mine!
We don't sell film here.
And the shop is closed now.
I'm very sorry.
I'm sorry.
Excuse me. Sorry, do you sell film?
What?
400 ISO.
No.
You like Leica?
Can I have a look?
What are you doing here?
If you don't mind,
we can chat in the restroom.
I don't mean anything by that.
I'm shocked a teenager
like you has a Leica camera.
Very impressive.
Do you know when
the M2 was produced?
Do you develop
the photos yourself?
This is so wonderful.
Oh.
Got it.
Finished.
Going home.
You're leaving
this town tomorrow.
If I ever see your face
in my 'hood again,
I will kill you.
Dr. Tokihito? Sorry, haven't seen him.
BUt hey, hey why don't you...
Sorry.
I will develop the
photos tomorrow.
Come to my shop, I
have film there.
Here's the address.
Thank you.
But this is really a precious
thing, very expensive, right?
How much? 100 thousand?
You must have really wanted to buy it.
Buying it with a part-time salary.
This is great.
Let's go.
Thanks, but no.
We broke up last year.
And I'm with that man now.
Why am I doing
everything for you?
I would do anything for you.
I wanna help you.
Would you kill that man?
Did't you say you'd
do anything?
Can you do that?
What have you done for
me? What can you do?
Have you finished?
Actually what's the
most important to me
and what do I want?
I'm never sure of it.
What do you want?
I want you.
Why do you choose me?
Because you're weak and foolish.
That's a lie.
Actually you don't want
anything in particular.
No.
Because I love you.
I'm just a useless person.
Yes.
So, we need to change.
I've only saved lives.
I have never
committed murder.
Useless.
It's impossible
to be as strong as you.
Then let
yourself grow stronger.
Kill me and take me away.
Enough of this then.
You can't handle her.
Shut up.
Are you telling me
what to do?
A useless guy like you.
Got it.
She said something
to confuse you, right?
You can't handle her if you
listen to everything she says.
Shut up.
Why did you become a patrolman?
You're useless and you want
your country to depend on you?
If it was that,
then get your priorities straight,
that's the right choice.
Shut up or else I'll shoot,
I mean it.
Why? Tired? Your
hands are shaking.
Okay, enough now.
Are you stupid?
You killed him?
I still love him.
Liar.
Are you stupid?
Eh?
Run. Hurry.
You're still useless.
You're so full of yourself.
You still haven't grown up!
Stop fooling around!
I can't live without
someone to rely on.
Can I rely on you?
Useless man,
Who do you think you are?
Idiot! Useless!
Shut up.
Dr. Tokito? We met today.
Who are you?
My breasts were all over him.
What?
This belongs to Dr. Tokito.
Liar.
I'm Kudou, a friend of Tokito.
We met before.
Where?
This evening.
Sir's car was
running at the beach there.
With a woman.
That woman was, like, working
at the hair salon
in the Temiyako building.
Hair salon?
Called CREO.
My ex-lover got his
hair cut there.
Then, she cut his
hair after we broke up.
Hey.
Let me tell you a funny story.
Everyone in the same bunch as me
and Tokito
all know this story.
Once, there was a young doctor.
He had a good character
and first-rate medical skills.
A promising guy
that everyone admired.
But one day, the doctor
made a huge mistake.
He damaged an artery
while doing a tracheotomy.
The patient died
from excessive bleeding.
It was bad.
Although the accident
was kept a secret,
his life completely changed.
That young doctor didn't want
to be outstanding and successful.
He was willing to go anywhere
as long as he could save lives.
A war-torn country,
a desert country.
An earthquake-stricken country,
disease-ridden country.
His friend told him.
He was really
great but very stupid.
Then, don't know how.
This young doctor returned
to a medical team.
Salary was high.
But his job was doing statistics
by using drugs on patients.
It's dangerous human experimentation.
It's the worst job.
His friend said,
he is giving up
himself, but very smart.
What else could he do?
Such a pity.
Madam.
I thought it was you.
I'm Tanabi, from
Kentarou Group.
Kentarou?
I met you once
before at a party.
You don't seem to
remember me.
You guys have done a terrible
 thing to Dr. Tokito.
What are you doing?
Bastard.
Why?
Why did you do that?
Humans die easily.
It's absenteeism
if I don't go back.
What about this car?
Ditch it.
Ah, I forgot something.
Find it?
How?
You're a cop, but you've
become the criminal now.
I don't know.
Today seemed like an eternity.
You can relax after this song.
I didn't do anything wrong.
I need to work tomorrow.
What did you give me to drink?
Don't worry, I drank it too.
Murder is the death penalty.
Let me get the death penalty too.
I will accompany you.
What happened?
President Kentarou is dead.
What?
He and a woman were found
in a hotel in Hakone.
He was murdered.
He finally died.
Really?
Hakone police station has
set up an investigation team.
There are about 100 people.
And the investigation is about
the fighting of violent groups.
Yanagimachi.
There's something I
don't understand.
Go ahead.
Kentarou met with president
Temiyako yesterday.
Temiyako Meiko, wife
of president Temiyako.
You may go.
But the other person can't leave yet.
Injury, property damage.
Let him stay
longer as a punishment.
Do you know Dr. Tokito
from the International
Medical Volunteer Organization?
Yes, he is an excellent doctor.
Actually few hours ago,
there was a dead
body found in Hakone
and he is the
suspected murderer.
The victims are Kentarou
and his secret lover.
Tokito is our prime suspect.
His car was found.
And now we're tracking him.
Was there any argument between
him and Temiyako Group?
Mrs. Temiyako,
how very unfortunate.
I'm sorry, our staff have made
you go though the trouble .
Not at all.
I met the president.
I received the red
wine from him.
My wife. . .
Can I have a word with
you for a second?
What is it?
I don't have money to get back.
I see. Please wait.
According to the hotel staff,
Tokito and a girl
check into the hotel together.
But no one saw Tokito.
And there is
another thing as well.
What?
According to a witness,
there was fighting in
a side street yesterday.
And one of those involved was a cop.
Cop?
Is there any relation?
We still don't know.
A patrol officer guarding the Defense
Minister yesterday is missing.
Akagi Kunie,
27 years old,
A patrolman from
Minami Police Station.
I'm going to Hakone.
What else can I do?
Hello, I'd like to know the address
of the girl who's off today.
Sorry.
I need to know.
I can't tell you.
Tell me!
Please tell me! Now!
You told her the address?
Sir, I've switched on the
electricity now.
Enjoy your meal.
Mr. Tokito.
Morning, can I
borrow your phone?
Go ahead.
And coffee.
Hey.
Mr. Tokito is here.
I'd like to have a look
at the president's office.
Certainly.
Upstairs.
Okay.
Here.
Strange, the president doesn't
usually lock the door.
President, are you there?
Can you hear me?
Sir, look.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Worked over time, tired.
Are you Dr. Tokito?
We have reason to suspect
you are involved in the
murder of Kentarou
and Nakai Sakuyoshi.
Please come with us.
Tokito has already
been arrested in Yokohama.
And he is at Yokohama Police
Station now.
Please inform everyone.
Yes.
You got something?
Yes, and Mr. Yanagimachi.
President Temiyako was found
dead in his office.
A gun was fired.
There's a distinct possibility he
committed suicide.
1.. 2.. 3.
Really?
He was holding
the gun firmly
and he was in his private
meeting room.
Please investigate thoroughly.
The trajectory and point of
impact of the bullet.
See if anything missing.
Don't jump to any conclusions.
Yes, understood.
Mr. Yanagimachi, how long
are you going to stay in Hakone?
I don't know.
Mr. Yanagimachi!
Gather everything and
report back to me.
Thank you.
Can I have a look at the evidence?
Not dead.
And now for our next story.
Police have discovered the
leader of a violent group
was murdered in a
hotel in Hakone.
At 11 pm.
In a hotel in Kanagawaken.
President Kitarou
and Nakai Sakuyoshi
were found murdered.
According to witnesses,
A man and a girl who
stayed with them
were seen leaving
after shots were fired.
In the following investigation,
police found that
the owner of the car
that was left at the scene
was Dr. Tokito Tajkahiko, 45 years old.
Tokito...
Kanagawaken Police have
set up a special investigation
team for this case.
Mr. Tokito...
It's okay.
They don't have evidence.
Not one thing.
Film!
What?
I gave the film to someone.
What the hell are you
talking about?
There is no film inside.
Does this camera work?
I don't know,
it's like an antique.
Everyone uses
digital cameras now.
I wouldn’t know how
to develop the pictures.
But Hakone is a
traditional place.
Forinstance...
There must be an old
style of photo shop.
Yes..
What?
Why has it turned out like this?
Explain it to me!
Well...
You asked him to go.
Why go there?
Where is Tokito?
Come here .
Who are you?
That coat...
What?
You did it.
What?
You two better
surrender yourselves.
What are you saying?
Matsumoto Mikako,
in the Minami Omachi
Nishi building
and a male suspect.
Who am I? Is that important?
Follow that motorcycle.
No way, too troublesome.
I don't care. Hurry up!
Shall we begin?
Did you kill Kentarou and
a woman in Hakone?
Hello.
This is Kanagawaken
Police Station.
Are you Meiko?
Yes.
Please listen to me.
Your husband, president Temiyako.
We found his body.
We would like
you to confirm it.
Please come to...
Can I smoke?
No smoking.
I see.
Why did you show up there?
Why are your clothes so dirty?
And I would like to know about
your president's suicide.
Can you explain it?
I have asked you 6 times.
According to your colleagues,
they left with you.
Where have you been?
In the elevator.
Elevator? Where?
Temiyako Building.
You finished work at 5pm.
Why were you still there?
Because...
Your car has found in Hakone.
And the hotel
had your name card.
How do you explain that?
Please, let me have some sleep.
No way.
Akagi Kunie...
Patrol officer from Yokohama?
No.
Let's talk some more about Kentarou.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
Mr. Tokito.
You wanted to pay
back president Temiyako.
who helped you when you
had medical trouble.
So you allowed
Temiyako to use your name
as a doctor to collect
illegal information.
Kentarou knew this and used
this to threaten Temiyako.
Then you followed Temiyako's
order to kill Kentarou.
No matter what,
you shouldn’t have killed him.
You're wrong.
I do everything
of my own free will.
I'm not weak.
I didn't expect we'd meet here.
Did you come here for this?
You know by now that your
husband has passed away.
But he did not commit suicide.
We have found Mr. Tokito.
He was locked in an elevator.
Your relationship
is not only that.
If you're in love with someone,
then there must be
something left as a evidence.
So there is no perfect
criminal in this world,
even for love.
There must be evidence left.
You love him?
We don't have a witness
to Tokito killing.
As a supporter
of the suspect,
you will be be
questioned as well.,,
738
01:44:46,480 --> 01:44:50,041
Can I keep these photos?
I will be numb without these.
Then I will awake
in a the cold forest.
Always. Over and over.
Without him, I will
gradually die...
Without him, I will
gradually die...
Without him, I will
gradually die...
Gradually die. . .
