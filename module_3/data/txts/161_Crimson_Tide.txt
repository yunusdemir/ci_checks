<i>This is Richard Valeriani
reporting live for CNN</i>
<i>from the French aircraft carrier Foch
somewhere in the Mediterranean.</i>
<i>Six days ago,
as the rebellion in Chechnya</i>
<i>spread to
the neighbouring Caucasus republics,</i>
<i>the Russian president
ordered massive bombing strikes</i>
<i>against rebel positions
around Rutul and Belokany.</i>
<i>Appalled at the loss of human life,
the President of the United States</i>
<i>joined by the French president
and the British prime minister</i>
<i>suspended all foreign aid to Russia.</i>
<i>Ultranationalist leader
Vladimir Radchenko</i>
<i>denounced the US pressure
as an act of war</i>
<i>against the Russian Republic
and Russian sovereignty.</i>
<i>Denouncing his own president
as a US puppet</i>
<i>he called on the Russian people
to join him in revolt.</i>
<i>He said, "This brutish
and hypocritical American intervention</i>
<i>"will not go unanswered."</i>
<i>On Tuesday, at 10:00
in the morning Moscow time</i>
<i>the Russian parliament
was suspended</i>
<i>and martial law was declared.</i>
<i>With the government in crisis,
the Russian Republic</i>
<i>was entering into what can only
be described as a state of civil war.</i>
<i>Then yesterday at dawn,
Radchenko and rebel forces</i>
<i>seized the region around Vladivostok,
including a naval base</i>
<i>and a nuclear missile base
housing Russian ICBMs.</i>
<i>As regular Russian military forces
move in to encircle Radchenko</i>
<i>allied military forces
are in a state of high alert.</i>
<i>These French planes
taking off behind me</i>
<i>have been deployed
near the Caucasus</i>
<i>since the beginning of the crisis</i>
<i>and a crisis which started
in the Caucasus</i>
<i>has now spread to the Far East</i>
<i>and appears to be turning into
the worst standoff</i>
<i>since the Cuban missile crisis.</i>
<i>This is Richard Valeriani

Abracadabra!
- I can't hear
I need a volunteer from the audience.
- Me! Me!
- Me, me, me!
A brave volunteer.
Me! Me! Me!
Preferably...
Preferably somebody who was born
on October 18, 1990.
That's you, honey. That's you.
Over here? Over here?
You must be the birthday girl.
- What's your name?
- Robin.
<i>Russian ultranationalist leader,
backed by his rebel army</i>
<i>threatened nuclear attack
on the United States and Japan.</i>
<i>The threats come as a response to the
US involvement in Chechnya</i>
<i>and are not considered idle.</i>
Now sit on the board.
And tell me, Robin,
do you believe in magic?
- Where'd he go?
- Good. Because if you believe...
- I'll get him.
...we can suspend you in the air...
- Be right back.
...without the help of a flying carpet.
<i>Meeting in an emergency session...</i>
You'll miss your daughter's levitation.
<i>... while the President is sequestered
with his joint chiefs of staff.</i>
<i>That footage was taken yesterday,
but half an hour ago</i>
<i>surrounded by hostile forces,
rebel leader Vladimir Radchenko...</i>
Maybe it's not as bad as it looks.
<i>... threatened to use nuclear arms
on the United States and Japan</i>
<i>should anyone,
including the Russian Army,</i>
<i>attempt to move in on him.</i>
<i>Based on the history of this man
this can't be viewed as an idle threat.</i>
<i>- Sander Vanocur standing by...
- It is.</i>
Commander Hunter.
Annapolis.
Five patrols on fast attacks.
Two on boomers, one as X.O.
A year at...
Excuse me. Harvard?
I talked to your former C.O.
He tells me he tried to adopt you.
As you no doubt heard,
my X.O. has appendicitis.
He's the best I ever had.
I need a good man to fill his spot.
Your name was at the top of the list.
Well, that's good to know, sir.
It was a short list.
Your interests, Mr Hunter.
What do you like to do? Do you...
Do you paint, play ball, play
an instrument, ride motorcycles, what?
- I ride horses.
- Horses.
What's the best horse you ever rode?
- Arabian, sir.
- An Arabian? That's a powerful animal.
Yes.
- You ever ridden one?
- Me? Are you kidding?
I couldn't handle an Arabian.
Just give me an old paint.
Yeah, horses are fascinating animals.
Dumb as fence posts but very intuitive.
In that way, they're not too different
from high school girls.
They might not have
a brain in their head
but they do know
all the boys want to fuck 'em.
Don't have to be able to read Ulysses
to know where they're comin' from.
No, sir.
He approves of you.
Jack Russells. Smartest dogs alive.
Name's Bear.
Goes everyplace with me.
<i>Well, welcome aboard
the Alabama, son.</i>
- Do me proud.
- I will, sir.
- Congratulations, Mr Hunter.
- Thank you.
<i>If one Russian citizen is killed</i>
<i>and I am president</i>
<i>then I will kill 900,000 of the people
who are responsible.</i>
<i>- You'd use nuclear weapons?
- Yes, I would hit them...</i>
<i>- Attention!
...with nuclear weapons.</i>
<i>- At ease. Be seated.
- Sir, such talk is highly inflammatory.</i>
<i>My dear young lady,
I do not engage in "talk."</i>
<i>These are serious threats, which I
hope to be in the position to carry out.</i>
I take it you've seen enough?
Gentlemen, after a nice little vacation,
looks like we're back at it again.
I hope you enjoyed the peace, because
as of now, we're back in business.
In the good old days of Cold War,
the Russians could always
be depended on doing whatever is in
their own best interests.
But this Radchenko's playing
a whole new ball game
with a whole new set of rules.
Now I've heard people talk
but I don't think this man's talking
to get his picture in the paper.
He seems to have a serious weed
up his ass and a legitimate gripe.
Always a dangerous combination.
And I think he's capable
of doing every damn thing
he says he's going to do.
That's why we have to go out there
and give the man a moment of pause.
So ends theory.
Thus, let us begin the facts.
We've been informed by the NSA
that an entire rebel corps
of the Russian Army is involved.
That's four armoured divisions
numbering 60,000 men.
There seems to be massive defections.
Vladimir seems to be winning
the hearts and minds
of the Russian soldiers.
- Admiral.
- Thank you.
They've seized the region by
the Chinese and North Korean borders.
That includes a submarine base
from which they've surged
four Akula-class attack subs.
They have acquired
a nuclear base at Artem
that houses 25 hardened silos
for Russian ICBMs
armed with up to 10 warheads apiece.
Now the Russian government has
assured us that talks are underway.
They claim that Radchenko forces
do not possess the launch codes.
But if Radchenko were to crack them
they could launch against
our west coast direct
or come in over the Pole,
take out Washington and New York.
The Commander-in-Chief
has directed US military forces
to set DEFCON four.
We've been ordered
to get underway at 0600 hours
to assume alert coverage, mid-Pacific,
the Far Eastern TVD target package.
Please keep your men informed.
Lieutenant Commander Hunter
is our new X.O.
Please bring him up to speed
on ship's personnel and supplies.
- Admiral?
- No, that's it.
On your feet.
- Here we go again, Commander.
- Thank you.
You bet.
Hey, Bobby. This is Bobby Dougherty.
He's Supplies.
- Pleasure, Dougherty.
- Billy Linkletter, TSO.
- Mr Linkletter.
- Commander.
And you know Darik.
- Yes. Westergaurd. Long time no see.
- How's Julia?
- She's excellent.
- Good.
- And Roy Zimmer, Communications.
- Welcome aboard.
Thank you.
<i>We served together
on the Baton Rouge.</i>
- Twice.
- That's right. We're lucky to have him.
I think his dog gave me
the final seal of approval.
He's crazy about that dog.
Takes him everywhere.
The Navy looks the other way
'cause he's Ramsey.
Navy looks the other way
'cause he's one of the few skippers left
who've seen combat.
- He took SEALS into Panama in '89.
- Tomahawks in the Gulf in '91.
- Took out eight or nine X.O.S in '94?
- Ouch.
- Last one caught what? Appendicitis?
- Yeah, right.
<i>- The Enemy Below.
- Robert Mitchum.</i>
- And?
- And what?
- Robert Mitchum.
- Incomplete answer.
- The German guy with the white hair?
- Yeah. What's his name?
- Who was it?
- Curd Jürgens.
Hardy Krüger.
No way.
Robert Shaw in his Nazi period.
Question is invalid. We're even.
- How you doin'?
- I'm fine. Thanks.
Good. Address me as "sir"
when you speak to me!
Stand at attention, sailor!
Is he gonna fit in the sub?
Doubtful.
Who played
the German sub commander
<i>in The Enemy Below
with Robert Mitchum?</i>
- Was it Curd Jürgens or Hardy Krüger?
- Sir...
Wrong answer!
Drop down and give me 20! Now!
- Move! Move!
- One. Two.
<i>- Run Silent, Run Deep.
- Three.</i>
The guy with the ears
and a little moustache.
Cary Grant.
I'm worried about T.
- Why?
- She doesn't know what's goin' on.
I think she thinks
I'm goin' away forever.
- I'll take care of her.
- You will?
- Yeah.
- You promise?
I promise.
- I love you, Dad.
- I love you too, son.
Okay.
You know I don't know what to say.
Just say good-bye.
See you in my dreams.
Give me a kiss.
- Davis.
- How you doin', sir?
Crew present and accounted for, sir.
Little ducks,
there's trouble in Russia.
So they called us.
We're going over there and bringing
the most lethal killing machine
ever devised.
We're capable
of launching more firepower
than has ever been released
in the history of war.
For one purpose alone,
to keep our country safe.
We constitute the front line
and the last line of defence.
I expect and demand your very best.
Anything less,
you should have joined the Air Force.
This might be
our Commander-in-Chief's Navy,
but this is my boat.
And all I ask is that
you keep up with me.
And if you can't
that strange sensation you'll be feeling
in the seat of your pants
will be my boot in your ass.
- Mr Cob?
- Yes, sir!
You're aware of the name of this ship,
aren't you, Mr Cob?
Very aware, sir!
It bears a proud name,
doesn't it, Mr Cob?
Very proud, sir!
- It represents fine people.
- Very fine people, sir!
- Who live in a fine, outstanding state.
- Outstanding, sir!
In the greatest country
in the entire world.
In the entire world, sir.
<i>- And what is that name, Mr Cob?
- Alabama, sir!</i>
And what do we say?
- Go, 'Bama!
- Go, 'Bama!
- Roll tide!
- Roll tide!
Chief of the Boat, dismiss the crew.
Dismiss the crew. Aye-aye, sir.
Crew! Department heads!
Attend to your departments!
Fall out!
Here. Part of your qualification
for command.
The last breath of polluted air
for the next 65 days.
Gonna miss it.
I don't trust air I can't see.
This is my favourite part.
Right here, right now.
Bravo, Hunter.
Sir?
You knew to shut up
and enjoy the view.
Most eggheads want to talk it away.
Your stock just went up
a couple of points.
Thank you, sir.
Allow me to give you
a tiny bit of advice.
If you want your own boat someday
the very worst thing you can do
is worry about yourself
or try to impress me.
I can't stand save-asses,
and I won't abide kiss-asses.
You keep your priorities straight:
Your mission and your men.
How you like that cigar?
- It's good, sir.
- It's your first.
Yeah.
Don't like it too much.
They're more expensive than drugs.
X.O., take her down.
Take her down. Aye, sir.
Control, Bridge, sounding.
<i>Bridge, Control,
sounding 130 fathoms.</i>
- Lookouts, clear the bridge.
- Clear the bridge. Aye, sir.
Officer of the deck, prepare to dive.
- Captain down.
- Captain is down.
- X.O. down.
- X.O. is down.
- Submerge the ship.
- Diving Officer, submerge the ship.
- Make your depth 150 feet.
- Make my depth 150 feet. Aye, sir.
Chief of the watch,
on the 1 MC, dive, dive!
Make your depth 150 feet.
Five degree down bubble.
- I don't understand.
- You don't understand?
Radchenko is a fanatic, okay?
He's a potential Hitler.
- Somebody should just shoot him.
- I have no problem with that.
- Good.
- Well, it's fanatics who make history.
- Colonel Patton was a fanatic.
- That's what made him great.
You think this guy is Patton?
He's a dangerous lunatic, threatening
nuclear war, and he means it.
What's that make us,
since we're the only nation
to ever drop a nuclear bomb?
It makes us a prime target.
There's a half a dozen
other Third World countries
with atom bombs
who'd love to drop one on us.
That's right. That's why
we should drop one on them.
Are you a communist?
You have a problem with us dropping
nuclear bombs on Japan?
Shut up, Dougherty.
You think it was a mistake, Mr Hunter?
Sir?
Using the bomb
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
Well, if I thought that, sir,
I wouldn't be here.
- Interesting way you put that.
- How'd I put it, sir?
Very carefully.
You do quality your remarks.
Somebody asked me if we
should have bombed Japan,
a simple, "Yes, by all means, sir.
Drop that fucker. Twice."
I don't mean to suggest
that you're indecisive, Mr Hunter.
Not at all.
Just complicated.
Of course, that's the way
the Navy wants you.
Me, they wanted simple.
Well, you certainly fooled them, sir.
Be careful there, Mr Hunter.
It's all I got to rely on,
bein' a simpleminded son of a bitch.
Rickhover gave me my command,
a checklist, a target
and a button to push.
All I had to know is how to push it.
They'd tell me when.
They seem to want you to know why.
I would hope they'd want us all
to know why, sir.
At the Naval War College,
it was metallurgy and nuclear reactors,
not 19th-century philosophy.
"War is a continuation of politics
by other means."
Von Clausewitz.
I think, sir, that what he was actually
trying to say was a little more...
Complicated?
Yes, the purpose of war is
to serve a political end,
but the true nature of war
is to serve itself.
I'm very impressed.
In other words, the sailor
most likely to win the war
is the one most willing to part
company with the politicians
and ignore everything except
the destruction of the enemy.
You'd agree with that.
I'd agree that that's what Clausewitz
was trying to say.
But you wouldn't agree with it?
No, sir, I do not.
No, I just think that in the nuclear world
the true enemy can't be destroyed.
Attention on deck.
Von Clausewitz will now tell us
exactly who the real enemy is.
Von?
In my humble opinion,
in the nuclear world
the true enemy is war itself.
<i>Everywhere I go your face I see</i>
<i>Every step I take</i>
<i>You take with me</i>
<i>Nowhere to run to, baby</i>
<i>Nowhere to hide</i>
<i>Got nowhere to run, baby</i>
<i>Nowhere to hide</i>
<i>I know you're no good for me</i>
<i>But free of you I'll never be, baby</i>
Move!
Fire in the galley! Chief of the watch,
sound the general alarm!
<i>Forward damage control, bring
additional fire extinguishers to the...</i>
Fire's out of control. He's hurtin'.
- You hit the kill switch?
- Couldn't get to it. Too hot.
<i>Attention, all hands.
Fire has been contained.</i>
<i>Damage control party,
assess damage and report to Control.</i>
Initiate weapons system readiness test.
Aye, sir.
All right, station a reflash watch.
This thing could flare back up again.
Conn, Radio, we are receiving flash
traffic emergency action message.
Recommend alert one.
Recommend alert one.
<i>Alert one. Man battle stations missile
for weapons systems readiness test.</i>
<i>Spin up all missiles.</i>
What the hell is he runnin'
a missile drill now for?
- You're in charge.
- Aye, sir.
<i>Man battle stations missiles
for weapons system readiness test.</i>
<i>Spin up all missiles.
This is an exercise.</i>
Captain's in Control.
I agree.
The message is properly formatted.
Sir, we have a properly formatted
emergency action message
for weapons system readiness test, sir.
<i>- I concur, sir.
- Where's the X.O.?</i>
<i>- Sir.
- Good of you to make it, Mr Hunter.</i>
<i>Get the authenticator.</i>
Get the authenticator.
Let's go.
Sir, request permission to authenticate.
Permission granted. Authenticate.
"Alpha, Alpha, Bravo,
Echo, Charlie, Zulu, Tango."
"Alpha, Alpha, Bravo, Echo,
Charlie, Zulu, Tango."
- Captain, message is authentic.
- I concur, sir.
- I agree.
- Message is authentic.
Sir, your captain's missile key.
Set condition 1 SQ for WSRT.
This is the captain. This is an exercise.
Set condition 1 SQ for WSRT.
This is the X.O. This is an exercise.
Captain, that fire in the galley
could still flare...
Now is not the time.
Make your depth 150 feet. All stop.
Make my depth 150 feet. All stop.
Aye, sir.
Weapons, Conn,
simulate pressurising, all tubes.
<i>Conn, Weapons,
simulate pressurising, all missiles.</i>
Aye-aye, sir.
Simulate pressurising, all missiles.
<i>Simulate pressurising, all missiles.
Aye.</i>
All stations, proceed to 1 SQ.
Ready all missiles for launch.
Come on, guys. Let's go!
Weapons, Captain,
report approximate time for 1 SQ.
Captain, Weapons, approximate time
to weapons system 1 SQ
14 minutes, sir.
Ship is at launch depth.
Ready to hover, sir.
- Very well. Commence hovering.
- Commence hovering. Aye, sir.
Control, Sick Bay,
Chief Petty Officer Marichek
is undergoing cardiac arrest.
<i>- We're beginning CPR.
- Chief of the watch, on the 1 MC.</i>
<i>Gentlemen, may I have
your attention, please?</i>
<i>We've received word that a shipmate
is experiencing a medical problem.</i>
<i>We're terminating the drill.</i>
Mr Mahoney, take the conn.
I'm going below.
- X.O.
- Aye, sir. I have the conn.
Clear.
It's okay, Chief.
Thank you, sir. Sorry, sir.
Hiya, boy. Hiya, hiya, hiya.
How ya doin'? Oh, boy. Yeah.
So, Mr Hunter, do you think
I was wrong to run that drill?
Not necessarily, sir.
- Do you think I got that man killed?
- No, sir.
One thing had nothing to do
with the other. It was an accident.
- Would you have run the drill?
- No, sir, I wouldn't have.
Why not?
The fire in the galley
could have flared back up.
- I would have seen to it first, sir.
- I'm sure you would have.
Me, on the other hand, I tend to think
that's the best time to run a drill.
Confusion on the ship
is nothing to fear.
It should be taken advantage of.
Lest you forget, Mr Hunter, we are
a ship of war, designed for battle.
You don't just fight battles
when everything is hunky-dory.
What'd you think, son?
I was just some crazy old coot
putting everyone in harm's way
as I yell "yee-haw"?
That was not my first thought, sir.
But there's no excuse. At the time
I was fighting the fire in the galley
I did not agree with your call, sir.
Take a seat.
Just so we understand each other
I don't have any problems
with questions or doubts.
As I said to you before, I'm not
seeking the company of kiss-asses.
When you got somethin' to say to me,
you say it in private.
And if privacy doesn't permit itself,
then you bite your fucking tongue.
- Are we clear about that, Commander?
- As a bell, sir.
Those sailors out there are just boys,
boys who are training to do a terrible
and unthinkable thing,
and if that ever occurs
the only reassurance they'll have
that they're doing the proper thing
is gonna derive from their unqualified
belief in the unified chain of command.
That means we don't question each
other's motives in front of the crew.
It means
we don't undermine each other.
It means in a missile drill
they hear your voice right after mine,
without hesitation.
- Do you agree with that policy, sailor?
- Absolutely, sir.
We're here to preserve democracy,
not to practise it.
There'll be a memorial service in
the enlisted men's mess at 1100 hours.
- Go see to it.
- Aye-aye, sir.
Oh, Hunter.
Short of the outbreak of World War III,
the ship sinking or being
attacked by a giant octopus,
I'd like to be undisturbed
for the next 30 minutes.
I'll see to it, sir.
By the way, it was Marichek's
300 pounds that killed him.
Not the fire.
Dismissed.
One, two, three, four.
Back. Back.
One, two. One, two.
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
Does it make any sense to you to start
a drill in the middle of a fire?
- Fire was out, wasn't it?
- Yeah, and a man died, too.
- Not 'cause of what the captain did.
- What?
- Not 'cause of what the captain did.
- Weps...
A fire is a serious threat to the ship.
Now where was he?
- Why didn't he check it out first, huh?
- That's his style.
- He's a hard-ass.
- So what?
So you wanna fight him, go ahead.
You wanna get along, you gotta get
to understand him a little bit.
Two schools of thought here.
To him, you're Annapolis, Harvard,
expert on theory,
well-versed in world affeirs.
He's had his head up his ass
drivin' ships for the last 25 years.
He's probably
a little paranoid about that.
I mean, Navy's all he's got.
Navy and that little rat-dog of his.
That's why his wife left him.
So what are you saying?
I'm just sayin' watch out.
Give him a little room.
Let him get to know you.
You do pants, too?
Conn, Radio:
Receiving emergency action message.
Recommend alert one.
Recommend alert one!
<i>Alert one! Alert one!
Incoming emergency action message!</i>
<i>Alert one! Alert one! Incoming EAM.</i>
Captain.
Captain has asked me to brief you
on the emergency action message
we just received.
As you know, before we got underway,
the Russian army was in position
and circling the rebel camps,
and Radchenko started making
extravagant threats
should anyone move in on him
that he would launch
his land-based nuclear weapons
at the United States and at Japan.
The only safeguard was
that the Russian government
controlled the launch codes.
Intel now indicates that those
launch codes have been compromised.
US military forces have been
directed to set DEFCON three.
The last time we hit
this state of emergency
was 32-and-a-half years ago
during the Cuban missile crisis.
So this is what it's all about,
gentlemen. It's what we train for.
Captain.
The NCA has determined
that should our satellites detect
rebel missiles being fueled,
which means they could be
launched in just over one hour,
we'll be compelled to act.
Now given our patrol sector
here in the Emperor Sea Mounts,
it seems clear that our friends
in the Pentagon
are setting us up for
a potential preemptive strike.
It's important to remain focused.
Keep your men informed.
Any questions?
Dismissed.
We lost that frying unit, and then
we can't get the same capacity in...
Hey, man!
I'm gonna fuck you up! Get out! Get...
Get out of here, man! Get him out!
Motherfucker!
- Fuckin' piece of shit.
- Bennefield, you crazy, man?
- Rivetti, what's up?
- I'm sorry, sir.
It's just a difference of opinion
that got out of hand.
What about?
It's really too silly to talk about, sir.
I'd rather just forget about...
I don't give a damn about
what you'd rather forget about.
Why were you two fighting?
I said that the Kirby Silver Surfer
was the only real Silver Surfer
and that the Moebius Silver Surfer
was shit.
And Bennefield's a big Moebius fan,
and...
It just got out of hand.
I pushed him, he pushed me.
- I lost my head, sir. I'm sorry.
- Rivetti, you're a supervisor.
You can get a commission like that.
I know it, sir. You're 100% right.
- It'll never happen again.
- It better not happen again.
I see this kind of nonsense, I'm gonna
write you up. You understand?
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.
You have to set an example
even in the face of stupidity.
Everybody that reads comic books
knows that Kirby Silver Surfer
is the only true Silver Surfer.
- Now am I right or wrong?
- You're right, sir.
- All right. Get out of here.
- Yes, sir.
- Captain.
- How can I help you?
Test results from the missile drill.
This the best they can do?
No, sir, but that's what they did.
I want this down to five minutes.
Train on it.
Yes, sir.
Tell your buddy Weps
we're gonna do it again.
We're gonna keep on doin' it
until he gets it right.
Damn.
Feels like the whole crew
needs a kick in the ass.
Or a pat on the back, sir.
I just witnessed a fight down in
crew's mess. No big deal,
but I think the men are a little on edge
with all we're going through.
Morale seems to be a bit low.
Well, you seem to have
the pulse of the men.
Thank you, sir.
<i>May I have your attention, please?</i>
<i>Mr Hunter has informed me
that morale may be a bit low,</i>
<i>that you may be a bit...</i>
<i>- On edge.
- On edge.</i>
<i>So I suggest this,</i>
<i>any crew member who feels
he can't handle the situation</i>
<i>can leave the ship right now.</i>
<i>Gentlemen, we"re at DEFCON three.</i>
<i>War is imminent.</i>
<i>This is the captain.</i>
<i>That is all.</i>
Very inspiring, sir.
Come on, Bear. Come on. Come on.
Sup? Come here.
You hear that?
I've got a broadband contact
bearing 047.
Assigning tracker sierra in ATF.
Conn, Sonar, we have a possible
submerged submarine bearing 047.
Designate contact, Master 28.
Sonar, Conn, aye.
Man battle stations torpedo.
- Rig for ultraquiet.
- Make tubes one and four fully ready.
Make tubes one and four fully ready.
Aye, sir.
<i>Man battle stations torpedo.</i>
All right, what do you got?
Sir, we have a possible
submerged submarine
bearing 049, designate master 28.
Best depth for evasion, sir,
is 831 feet to avoid that sub.
Lieutenant Mahoney,
this is the captain.
Increase your speed to standard.
Come left to course 270.
Make your depth 831 feet, smartly.

Get the classification on your monitor.
Rivetti, what the hell is going on?
Sir, the master 28 is classified as
a Russian Akula-class hunter-killer.
Bearing 196, sir! He's close,
but I don't think he's spotted us.
- Stay on him!
- Aye, sir.
- Captain has the conn.
- Passing 800 feet, sir.
Continue to dive.
Give me five degree down bubble.
- Continue rigging for ultraquiet.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Five degree down bubble.
Rigging for ultraquiet, sir.
<i>Gentlemen, this is the captain.</i>
<i>We have an Akula-class submarine
out there.</i>
<i>We know Radchenko controls
at least four submarines.</i>
<i>This could be one of them.</i>
<i>Russian rebels have threatened

Very well.
Mr Hunter, go to Radio, please.
- Okay, pull up the code.
- What do you got?
X.O., incoming EAM,
but we're too deep
to receive
any radio communication, sir.
<i>- Captain.
- X.O.</i>
<i>We got a limited radio transmission
indicating an incoming EAM.</i>
We need to go shallow
to reestablish communications.
With that sub still up there?
Mr Hunter, it's my...
<i>- Come up to conn, Mr Hunter.
- Yes, sir.</i>
- Zero bubble.
- Zero bubble. Aye, sir.

<i>Conn, Weapons, missile systems

<i>- Sir.
- Attention, all hands.</i>
<i>- Ship has been rigged for ultraquiet.
- Captain?</i>
When our missile system
is ready, Mr Hunter,
it is my intention to rise to launch depth
launch our birds
and then get the hell out of there.
Not until then.
I can't jeopardise
the safety of this ship.
Yes, sir.
May I suggest that we float
the buoy, sir? We have enough cable.
That should give us enough reach
to receive the EAM transmission.
Sir.
Very well. Float the buoy.
Chief of the watch, float the buoy.
Float the radio buoy. Aye, sir.
Radio buoy deploying, sir.
Tension 2,000 pounds.
Very well.
Conn, Weapons, estimated time

Mr Zimmer, where's that EAM?
- You all right, son?
- Yes, sir.
- That's it?
- It's incomplete, sir.
We lost it when the radio buoy cable
got severed.
All right.
All right, gentlemen, let's get on with it.
All ahead one-third.
Steady as you go.
All ahead one-third. Steady. Aye, sir.
Make your depth 150 feet. Zero bubble.
Up slow and silent to launch depth.
Up slow and silent to launch depth.
Aye-aye, Captain.
Captain? Got the EAM.
- What do you think?
- I think there's nothing on this.
Yes, sir. It got cut off during the attack.
Then it's meaningless.
Sir, this is an EAM
pertaining to nuclear missiles.
No, Mr Hunter,
that's a message fragment.
Because it got cut off
during the attack, sir.
The message could mean anything.
It could be a message to abort.
- It could be a message...
- Could be a fake Russian transmission.
Which is exactly why
we need to confirm it, sir.
All I'm asking for is the time we need
to get back on line.
- Calm down, Mr Hunter.
- I am calm.
You don't appear to be calm.
<i>Conn, Weapons, missile systems
ready to launch in four minutes.</i>
- Step aside, seaman.
- Yes, sir.
We have orders in hand,
and those orders are
to make a preemptive launch.
Every second that we lose
increases the chances
that by the time our missiles arrive,
their silos could be empty,
'cause they've flown their birds
and struck us first.
- Yes, sir.
- You know as well as I do
that any launch order received
without authentication is no order at all.
- Captain, National...
- That's our number 1 rule.
That rule is the basis for the scenario
we've trained on time and time again.
- Yes, sir.
- It's a rule we follow without exception.
Captain, National Military Command
Centre knows what sector we're in.
They have satellites looking down
on us to see if our birds are aloft.
And if they're not, then they give
our orders to somebody else.
That's why we maintain more than one
sub. It's what they call "redundancy."
- I know about redundancy, Mr Hunter.
- All I'm saying...
All I'm saying, Captain,
is that we have backup.
Now, it's our duty not to launch
until we can confirm.
You're presuming that we have other
submarines out there ready to launch.
But as captain, I must assume
that our submarines could have been
taken out by other Akulas.
We can play these games all night,
Mr Hunter, but I don't have the luxury
- of your presumptions.
- Sir...
Mr Hunter, we have rules
that are not open to interpretation,
personal intuition, gut feelings,
hairs on the back of your neck,
little devils or angels
sitting on your shoulders.
- Captain...
- We're all very well aware
of what our orders are
and what those orders mean.
They come down from
our Commander-in-Chief.
They contain no ambiguity.
- Captain, sir...
- Mr Hunter, I've made the decision.
I'm captain of this boat.
Now shut the fuck up!
Damn.
Weapons, Conn,
<i>shift targeting
to target package SLBM 64741/2.</i>
This is the captain.
- Captain, I cannot concur.
- Repeat my command.
Sir, we don't know what this means.
Our target package
could have changed.
You repeat this order
or I'll find somebody who will!
- Hell, no, you won't, sir.
- You're relieved of your position.
Cob, remove Mr Hunter
from the control room.
- Get Lieutenant Zimmer in here now!
- No, sir, I do not concur
and I do not recognise your authority
to relieve me
on the command
under Navy regulations.
- Cob, arrest this man and get him out!
- Captain Ramsey,
under operating procedures governing
the release of nuclear weapons
we cannot launch our missiles
unless both you and I agree!
- Cob, what are you waiting for?
- Now this is more than formality, sir.
This is why your command must
be repeated! It requires my assent!
I do not give it, and, furthermore,
you continue upon this course
and insist upon this launch
without confirming this message first...
- Son of a bitch. Chief of the boat...
- I will be forced,
backed by the rules of precedents...
As captain and commanding officer
of the USS Alabama...
...authority and command regulation
08150H6...
I order you to place the X.O.
Under arrest on the charge of mutiny!
...of the Navy regulations to relieve you
of command, Captain!
I say again, I order you
to place the X.O. under arrest
on the charge of mutiny!
- Cob!
- Captain, please, the X.O. is right.
We can't launch unless he concurs.
"To the USS Alabama.
"Rebel-controlled missiles
being fueled.
"Launch codes compromised.
"Dissidents threaten launch
at continental United States.
"Set DEFCON two.
"Lmmediately launch
10 Trident missile sorties."
They're fueling their missiles!
We don't have time to fuck around!
Sir, I think you need time
to think this over.
I don't have to think this over!
Captain, I relieve you
of your command of this ship.
Cob, escort the captain
to his stateroom.
- I'm assuming command.
- You're not assuming anything.
Chief of the Boat,
Captain Ramsey's under arrest.
Lock him in his stateroom.
- Captain, please...
- Now, Cob!
Aye, sir. Mitchell! Walker!
Take the captain below.
You're way out of your league, Hunter.
You're not ready to make
tough decisions yet.
What the hell we waitin' for?
Anybody here disagrees
with what I've done,
then you feel free
to relieve yourself of duty now.
Anybody?
All right.
- All stations.
- Aye, sir.
<i>This is the Executive Officer.</i>
<i>I have assumed command of this ship</i>
<i>under authority granted me
by Navy regulations.</i>
<i>I have relieved Captain Ramsey of
his duties for acting in contravention</i>
<i>of the rules and regulations
regarding nuclear weapons release.</i>
<i>It is my intention
to delay the missile launch,</i>
<i>maintaining our current state
of readiness,</i>
<i>pending confirmation
of an emergency action message</i>
<i>that was cut off during the attack.</i>
<i>Remain at battle stations missile.</i>
<i>Carry on.</i>
What the hell are we doin', Fred?
I don't know about you,
but I'm pissin' my pants.
Come on, boy.
Conn, Weapons, Russians will have
missile launch capability
in 39 minutes.
Chief of the Boat.
Sir?
Thank you, Cob.
"Thank you"? Fuck you.
Get it straight, Mr Hunter.
I'm not on your side.
Now you could be wrong.
But wrong or right, the captain can't
just replace you at will.
That was completely improper.
And that's why I did what I did,
by the book.
I thank you anyway.
Radio, Conn, Mr Zimmer, get those
communications back on line now.
We're working on it, sir.
Aye, aye, Captain.
- Are you ready?
- Ready. Go.
Jesus. This fuckin' thing...
You know, this whole system
is crashed, radio buoy is severed.
- What the fuck does he want us to do?
- Shit electrons?
Hey, Vossler, we need communications
not smart-ass remarks.
Aye, sir.
- All stop, ten degrees up.
- Ten up. Aye, sir.
All stop. Aye, sir. Enters all stop.
Conn, Sonar, holy shit, sir!
He's right on top of us!
He's turning toward!
- Range?
- 600 yards!
Conn, Sonar, torpedoes in the water!
Bearing 048, 050!
- Left full rudder!
- Left full rudder! Aye, sir!
All ahead full! Zero bubble!
Sir, don't you want to fire back?
Torpedoes are ready, sir.
No, we're in too close.
Our weapons won't have time to arm.
All ahead flank!
Chief of the watch to manoeuvring.
Give me max speed now!
Maximum speed! Aye, sir!
Sonar, Conn, let me know
when our range to that Akula
<i>is open to 1,000 yards!</i>
- Conn, Sonar, aye, sir!
- Damn it! Let's just shoot this fucker!
What's 1,000 yards for?
'Cause it takes 1,000 yards
for the torpedoes to arm!
Jesus! Who'd you fuck
to get on this ship?
<i>Conn, Sonar, torpedoes 150 yards
and closing fast, sir!</i>
<i>Bearing 070, 074!</i>
Launch port countermeasures!
- Countermeasures away, sir!
- Rig ship for impact.

- Steady course 231.
- Aye, sir. 231.
Arm torpedoes two and four...
- Now!
- Torpedoes armed, sir!
We're locked on the Akula!
You got him, sir! You got him!
Conn, Sonar, incoming torpedo!
They got it off before they got hit, sir!
Right full rudder!
Launch starboard countermeasures!
- Countermeasures away, sir!
- Dive! Make your depth 1,200 feet!
Point it down now!
Take her deep! Take her deep!
Full dive on those planes!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Hang on, everybody!
- Is everybody okay?
- Yeah!
Open aft main drain suction!
Start the drain pump! Go, go, go!
All stations,
make damage report to Control.
Control, this is Bilge Bay!
We've got out-of-control flooding!
Request damage control!
Mr Mahoney, get a
damage control party down there!
Aye, sir!
Forward damage control party,
get Lieutenant Hellerman!
Flooding in the bilge bay!
Get him down there now!
Conn, Manoeuvring,
we've lost propulsion, sir!
Chief of the Boat, how we doin'?
Sir, we are going down!
I need propulsion!
Forward ballast tanks
are damaged, sir!
Forward air pressure: Zero!
Manoeuvring, Conn,
restore propulsion as soon as possible.
Conn, Manoeuvring, restoring
propulsion as soon as possible!
Aye, sir!
Control, Bilge Bay, flooding is slowed!
<i>I think we got it under control, sir!</i>
Passing 1,500 feet.
At 1,850 it's all over.
Passing 1,600 feet.
Barnes, get over here!
Help me with this loose valve!
Passing 1,650 feet.
- What the fuck is going on?
- Take it easy.
Conn, Bilge Bay,
flooding has recommenced!
It looks like three men are trapped!
Bilge Bay, Conn, try and get those men
out of there and seal that bay.
Sir, if we don't seal the bilge bay now,
we'll lose the ship!
Bilge Bay, Conn,
can you get the men out?
Sir, there's no fuckin' way!
If I go down there, I'll never get out!
Barnes, come on! You've got to come!
<i>Move, move! Barnes, come on,
come on! You can do it! Move it!</i>
Bilge Bay, Conn, seal that bay.
Barnes, let's go! Come on!
I've got to close the hatch!
What the fuck are we doing here?
Bilge Bay, Conn,
I say again, seal that bay.
Sir, there are men down there,
and they're gonna drown!
Lieutenant Hellerman,
you have your orders!
Now seal the goddamn bay
before we all go down!
Barnes! Please get the fuck out!
Barnes!
Come on! Barnes!
Conn, Bilge Bay,

Very well.
Passing 1,800 feet.

<i>- And rising.
- Propulsion limit! Ahead full, sir!</i>
- Take us up to periscope depth.
- Aye-aye, sir.
Give me five.
All right, we're livin'.
We're livin', gentlemen.
- Step aside, Tommy.
- I'm sorry, sir. The X.O. ordered...
Fuck the X.O.!
This ship has been hit,
and I'm going in to see my captain.
Now stand aside.
Stand aside!
Captain?
- Sir.
- How bad is it, Mr Dougherty?
It's bad, sir.
I've just been looking
at Hunter's file here.
The closest to combat he's been
is a policy seminar.
Give me an order, sir.
As quietly as you can, you get
to Mr Zimmer and Mr Westergaurd.
How about Linkletter?
You won't be able to talk
to the TSO. He's at the conn.
But you can get to Weps.
We got to have Weps. He's the key.
You get me those men, a small security
force, then come back and get me.
Aye, sir.
Don't get overzealous and
try to recruit the whole ship.
- We'll lead from the top down.
- Aye, sir. Right away.
The radio's 50%.
Can I talk to you in the passageway?
Right now, Pete. Come on.
What's goin' on?
We're not gonna let this go down
with the X.O. at the helm.
- We're not?
- No, we're not.
I've been with the captain for years
and this asshole Hunter shows up,
and I'm supposed to follow him
'cause he says so?
You're not supposed to,
you've been ordered to.
That's what this is about,
proper orders.
Proper orders? He has proper orders.
He won't act on them.
He's in command now!
If they order him to launch, we'll
launch, and we'll blow 'em all to hell.
But I'd rather go down myself
than get this one wrong.
Look, our procedures are clear.
In the absence of a contravening order,
in a situation like this,
- we follow the orders in hand.
- Exactly.
You know how many checks we do to
make sure a launch order is authentic?
The X.O. agreed with those orders.
Now he just wants to throw them away?
They don't count?
- He's lost his nerve.
- Bullshit! I know this guy, Bobby!
Weps, we've been ordered to launch.
Now why in the world would we do that
if they weren't prepared
to launch at us?
We don't know that for sure.
That's the whole point.
That's why he wants time
to confirm the message.
That's the whole fucking point
is we don't have time!
Radchenko is fueling his birds.
Now why do you think he's doing that?
Why? You don't put on a condom
unless you gonna fuck!
Go back to your station.
Go back to your station and stay there.
Come on, man.
Peter, think about your family, man.
I am. I am!
I mean, what do you plan to do?
Nothing without you.
You're senior officer department head.
The TSO's with Hunter.
And you have the keys
to the small arms locker.
Now we want to recruit
a few more men,
and then
we're gonna open that arsenal.
I just talked to the captain in his room.
He specifically asked for you.
He says we cannot go without you.
I don't believe this.
This is a mutiny, Peter.
There's only two sides to a mutiny.
Now, your captain
is asking for your help.
What are you gonna do?
All right.
Conn, Weapons, Russian missiles
will have launch capability
in 24 minutes.
You're doing the right thing.
<i>Electrical power has been restored.</i>
<i>All stations,
prepare to reinitiate the system.</i>
Radio, Conn, Mr Zimmer,
what's the status on that radio repair?
Conn, Radio,
all systems are still down, sir.
Lieutenant Zimmer isn't here.
<i>- Where is he?
- I don't know, sir.</i>
Very well.
- Mr Mahoney has the conn.
- Aye, sir. I have the conn.
- Cob.
- Sir?
- Send a man and find Zimmer.
- Aye, sir.
- Get a side arm.
- Aye-aye, sir.
- Chief Young.
- Aye, Chief.
Turn around! Move it!
At ease, sailor.
Sir.
Thank you, Mr Ince.
- Mr Westergaurd.
- Sir.
- Mr Zimmer.
- Ready, sir.
Let's get on with it.
Stand guard.
All you people, return to your stations!
- Mr Rivetti.
- Sir?
- Follow me, please.
- Yes, sir.
Is there a problem, sir?
These are the keys
to the entire submarine.
Conn, Weapons, Russian missiles
will have launch capability
in 21 minutes.
Who's in charge here?
Shit!
Me, sir. Oh, fuck.
- How long is it gonna take?
- I don't know, sir.
- Do you know what's going on here?
- Yes, sir.
No, I don't think you do.
Let me explain it to you.
If we launch and we're wrong,
what's left of Russia
is gonna launch at us.
There will be a nuclear holocaust
beyond imagination.
So it's all about knowing, Mr Vossler.
We have to know
whether or not our order to launch
has been recalled or not.
The only way we're gonna know is if
you fix that radio. You understand me?
Yes, sir.
You ever watch Sfar Trek?
<i>- Yeah, I seen Sfar Trek.
- Star Trek. You know, Star Trek.</i>
The USS Enterprise. All right.
You remember when the Klingons
were gonna blow up the Enterprise?
And Captain Kirk calls down to Scotty,
"Scotty, I gotta have more power."
He needs more, more warp speed.
Yeah.
Warp speed. Exactly.
Well, I'm Captain Kirk.
You're Scotty. I need more power.
If you do not get this radio up,
a billion people are gonna die.
It's up to you. I know that's a shitty
deal, but you got it. Can you handle it?
Scotty?
Aye, Captain.
You got anything?
- No, Vossler.
- Then get on it.
- I have the conn.
- X.O. has the conn.
Chief of the Boat,
make your depth 75 feet.
Continue up to periscope depth.
Belay that order!
Any officers or chiefs feel you've been
unjustly caught up in this thing,
you stand with me now.
Sir, propulsion has been restored.
All flooding has been contained.
All communications are still down.
Take him away.
Lock him up in the officers' mess.
Of all the people.
Weps, return to missile control.
Mr Zimmer, you stay with me.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- The rest of you return to your stations.
Inform your men directly
that the captain is in command.
- I have the conn.
- Captain has the conn.
Diving officer,
make your depth 150 feet.
- At 150 feet. Aye, sir.
- 1 MC.
Aye, sir.
<i>May I have your attention, please.</i>

Weapons, Conn,
confirm target package SLBM 64741/2

<i>- Target package confirmation, sir.
- This is the captain.</i>
Conn, Weapons,
confirm target package SLBM 64741/2
for missiles one through five
and 20 through 24.
Aye, sir.
Look, it's not a mutiny.
I did everything by the book.
It's not about the book.
If the Russians are gonna launch
and we do nothing,
who's gonna stop 'em?
Half of me is glad
the captain came back.
He could be right, you know.
No orders are valid, Cob,
if they're wrong.
- We don't know if they're wrong.
- That's true. We don't know.
That's why we have to find out first.
What if Radchenko surrendered
and it's over?
We launch. They see us. They launch.
Our birds pass each other in the air.
Boom!
- What do you got?
- Nuclear war.
Nuclear holocaust.
- What are you doing down here?
- Jesus, I was just going to the bath...
Rivetti, nobody moves alone!
Come on. You know the drill.
What, Bennefield,
I need an escort to take a shit?
Shut up!
Now I'm gonna call Control.
You stay right there.
- Fuck that.
- I mean it, man.
Okay, Moebius, open the door.
- You broke my nose, man.
- Shut up, fat boy.
- Mr Rivetti, I'm impressed.
- I never liked him, sir.
Rivetti, go to laundry. Get four sets
of coveralls and four caps.
- Aye, sir.
- Just relax.
Can I talk to you a second?
Come on.
- Everybody ready?
- Let's do it.
- We're with you, sir.
- Let's go.
- Approaching launch depth.
- Very well.
Make your depth 150 feet.
Zero bubble. Commence hovering.
Zero bubble.
Commence hovering. Aye, sir.
Conn, Weapons, estimated time
to weapons system 1 SQ
three minutes, 30 seconds, sir.
Conn, Weapons, Russian missiles
will have launch capability
<i>in 12 minutes.</i>
<i>Opening missile hatches.</i>
<i>- Weps.
- Weps, this is Hunter. Listen to me.</i>
- Where are you?
- Don't worry about where I am.
You cannot proceed.
We got other ships out there
that can handle this.
You can't be influenced by the captain
or anybody else.
Make up your own mind.
Conn, Weapons,
estimated time to missile launch,
<i>three minutes and counting, sir.</i>
Weps, Weps, listen. Don't do this.
<i>Don't do this. Once you launch,
they cannot come back.</i>
<i>They cannot come back, Weps.</i>
<i>And you know the repercussions
if we're wrong, goddamn it!</i>
Weps, if we fire now, we'll be firing
while we're blind and crippled.
You understand me?
<i>- Where the fuck are you?
- Do not remove that firing trigger!</i>
<i>Do not open the safe, Weps!
It's up to you!</i>
You're the only one that knows
the combination! It's up to you, Weps!
It's up to you.
Mind your fuckin' panel!
- You guys ready?
- Just about, sir.
Radio, X.O. Vossler?
X.O, Radio.
- Sir, I don't know, sir.
- Vossler, calm down. Just calm down.
<i>- Take a deep breath. Are you calm?
- Yeah, sort of.</i>
Get the radio fixed, Vossler.
I could have built one by now.
How long is it gonna take you?
I don't know.
Well, how much time do you need?
Shit!
Let's go.
Missile tubes one through five
and 20 through 24 at 1 SQ, sir.
Ship is hovering on automatic.
Dive is at 1 SQ, Captain.
Missiles at 1 SQ. Ready to launch, sir.
Sir, weapons system is at 1 SQ.
- Missiles are ready for launch, sir.
- Very well.
- Weapons.
- Aye, sir.
Weapons, Conn,
remove the tactical firing trigger.
- 1 MC.
- Aye, sir.
Weapons, this is the captain.
Unlock the tactical firing trigger.
Weps?
Missiles are ready to launch, man.
Sir.
Shit.
Mr Zimmer, no one is to touch this key.
I'm going to launch
from missile control.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Westergaurd.
- Sir.
- Dougherty. Come with me.
- Mr Mahoney, take the conn.
- Aye, sir. I have the conn.
What are you doing, man?
We're at 1 SQ. We're ready.
<i>- Mr Dougherty.
- Aye.</i>
- Station your guards fore and aft.
- Last two, forward hatch!
First two, aft hatch!
They're gonna fire from missile control.
We've got to get back to the conn
and disarm the system. Come on.
We'll travel in the crawl spaces.
Mr Ince!
Mr Ince, remove the tactical firing key.
Sir, it is my duty to...
Son, don't talk to me about duty.
Open the fucking safe!
I can't do that, sir.
I'm gonna count to three,
and then I'm gonna blow
your fucking head off.
One.
<i>Two.</i>
Shit!
It does me no good to kill you.
You're the only one
that knows the combination.
However...
Petty Officer Hilaire
doesn't know the combination!
Millions of lives at stake here, Peter!
Don't make a dumb decision! One!
- Two!
- Sir!
<i>- Cob!
- Yo.</i>
You and Hunsicker are going
to enter the conn from the bow.
Rivetti, Linkletter and myself
will come in through the aft.
You jump right on Zimmer, okay?
Come on, come on!
- Fire control ready?
- Aye, sir.
- Launcher ready?
- Aye, sir.
Initiate fire.
- Freeze! Hold it, sir!
- Drop the weapon now!
Move forward! Move forward!
Move, move, move! Get his pistol!
- Fire one!
- Number one did not fire, sir.
Sir, the captain's key
has been removed.
Hunter.
- You're a piece of shit.
- Son of a bitch.
All right, you and you,
man the forward hatches.
- Aye, sir.
- You, man the aft hatches.
- Aye, sir.
- We're going up to periscope depth.
We're gonna
reestablish communications
and get that radio message.
Now anybody got a problem with that?
Chief of the Boat,
make your depth 78 feet.
Aye-aye, sir. Make your depth 78 feet.
- Five degree up bubble.
- Mr Linkletter, man that periscope.
Aye sir. Raising number two scope.
Radio, Conn, Mr Vossler,
this is Captain Kirk.
I need warp speed on that radio.
Yes, sir.
<i>Conn, Weapons, Russian missiles
will have launch capability</i>
<i>in nine minutes.</i>
- Oh, shit!
- What? What happened?
Reattach that lead!
Seventy-eight feet!
At periscope depth, sir!
- Mr Linkletter!
- No close contact, sir.
Very well. Chief of the watch,
raise the VLF radio antenna.
Raise the VLF antenna. Aye, sir.
VLF antenna coming up!
Conn, Radio, sir, I think
she's breathing. We're getting close.
- Halt, sir!
- Shoot me.
- Shit. Shit.
- I got him.
I have the conn.
Give me my missile key.
Give me the missile key, Mr Hunter.
I'm the commander of this fucking ship!
Give me that goddamn key!
<i>Conn, Weapons, Russian missiles
will have launch capability</i>
<i>in seven minutes.</i>
<i>Conn, Radio, sir!</i>
Radio, Conn!
Captain, Radio, Vossler, sir. She's
breathing again! We are really close!
You got three minutes, Vossler.
- Three minutes and counting!
- Yes, sir.
You got three minutes.
Come on.
Come on, Vossler. Come on, come on.
Keep it going, keep it going.
Speaking of horses,
did you ever see
those Lipizzaner stallions?
What?
From Portugal.
The Lipizzaner stallions.
The most highly trained horses
in the world. They're all white.
Yes, sir.
"Yes, sir" you're aware they're all white,
or "yes, sir" you've seen them?
Yes, sir, I've seen them.
Yes, sir, I'm aware that they're all white.
They're not from Portugal,
they're from Spain,
and at birth, they're not white,
they're black.
Sir.
I didn't know that.
But they are from Portugal.
Come on, Vossler. Come on.
- Yes. Yes.
- Come on. Come on. You got it.
Some of the things they do dety belief.
Their training programme
is simplicity itself.
You just stick a cattle prod up their ass,
and you can get a horse to deal cards.
Simple matter of voltage.
You're gonna get it. Come on.
I almost had it. You saw it.
Conn, Weapons,
<i>Russian missiles will have
launch capability in four minutes.</i>
- There you go! There you go!
- Ah, shit!
Look, look, look! Look at it, Vossler!
There we go, there we go!
Yes!
Conn, Radio, we are receiving flash
traffic. Emergency action message.
Recommend alert one.
Recommend alert one.
Fuck, yeah!
Alert one. Alert one.
Dougherty, Westergaurd, Zimmer.
- Get that EAM.
- Aye-aye, sir.
God help you if you're wrong.
If I'm wrong, then we're at war.
God help us all.
Sir, we have a properly formatted
emergency action message
from the National Command Authority,
sir.
- Request permission to authenticate.
- Permission granted. Authenticate.
"Delta, Delta, Sierra,
Bravo, Zulu, Delta, Tango."
- Message is authentic, Captain.
- I concur, sir.
I concur, sir.
Message is authentic.
1 MC.
<i>Crew of the Alabama,
this is the captain.</i>
Set condition 2SQ.
Terminate launch, all missiles.
All right! All right!
Mr Hunter has the conn.
<i>In the early hours of this morning,
Russian army forces moved in</i>
<i>and met surprisingly little resistance.</i>
<i>There were some sporadic battles</i>
<i>but, apparently, the spectre
of fighting their countrymen</i>
<i>proved too much for these rebel troops
and they surrendered quickly.</i>
<i>So a crisis
that seemed to be escalating</i>
<i>beyond the point of no return</i>
<i>was ultimately resolved with fewer
than a hundred soldiers dead.</i>
<i>And the nuclear base
captured by Radchenko</i>
<i>is back in government hands.</i>
<i>Reporting live from
the French aircraft carrier Foch</i>
<i>in the Mediterranean Sea,</i>
<i>this is Richard Valeriani for CNN.</i>
All right, stand there,
Lieutenant Commander Hunter.
This won't take long.
This panel has convened in order
to investigate the events
subsequent to the setting
of condition 1 SQ
for strategic missile launch
on board the USS Alabama
on 1 November.
Now, based on the testimony
from personnel on board the Alabama,
and, in no small measure, to that
of the senior officer, Captain Ramsey,
I am prepared to make
my recommendations to SUBPAC.
- Without my testimony, sir?
- You have a problem with that?
- I might, sir.
- I have known Captain Ramsey
for almost 30 years.
We served together
on more than a few occasions.
If he is lying, this will be
the first I've heard of it.
Yes, sir.
My primary concern here
is the breakdown in the system.
In this instance, the system failed
because the two senior officers did not
work to resolve their differences
while preserving
the chain of command.
Now you may have been
proven right, Mr Hunter,
but insofar as the letter of the law
is concerned,
you were both right.
And you were also both wrong.
This is the dilemma that will
occupy this panel, this Navy,
and this country's armed forces
as a whole,
long after you leave this room.
Off the record, you've both
created one hell of a mess.
A mutiny aboard a United States
nuclear submarine,
violation of nuclear launch protocol.
For the record,
it is the conclusion of this panel
that your actions aboard the Alabama
were consistent with
the best traditions of the Navy,
and in the interests
of the United States.
As such, the recommendations
of this panel will be to accept
in a manner reflective of his long
and dedicated service to his country,
Captain Ramsey's request
for early retirement from active duty.
And based, in no small part,
on Captain Ramsey's recommendation
that Lieutenant Commander Hunter
be given his next command
at the earliest possible convenience.
Unless, of course, you wish
to challenge these recommendations.
No, sir.
- Captain Ramsey?
- No, sir.
Dismissed.
Captain?
Just wanted to say thank you.
You were right, and I was wrong.
About the horses, the Lipizzaners.
They are from Spain, not Portugal.
Yes, sir.
