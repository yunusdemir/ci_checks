This is the best job I've ever had.
It’d better be.
It’s the last color.
You see, I got fired from
the Red Cab company and the...
Checkered Boat Cab company,
and the Green Cab company.
But this was different.
I can feel it.
Even though I've been here for about
7 days, 9 hours and 37 minutes.
Don't worry about him.
He's unflappable.
Birds never play into the accidents,
anyway. It’s usually the radio.
The radio is...
<i>...you got a problem?
- It’s the radio.</i>
See? 87 last checked in
at 4th and Wall...
which puts in a good
13 minutes away...
while 223 and 41 are both
south the Interstate...
which makes them much,
much closer to Division and Trent.
And then there's Dave, who checked
in last 10 minutes ago and I'm sure...
that he stopped at the Starbucks
at Stevens and Trackwood...
which just makes him
right around the corner.
I see the deployment
of the entire fleet in my mind.
And the big trouble is I just,
I can't not see it.
- Did you see that?
- Is anyone hurt?
What the hell is this?
What’s the matter with you?
Are you crazy or something?
Look at this!
Look at all...!
Who's gonna pay for all this?
I am talking to you.
This is coming out of you, pal.
We're gonna get you home
before group.
Don't walk away.
Come back here! You...!
Shoot!
I'll track your name down, pal.
Hey, where are you going?
Hey, where are you going?
You can't leave us right here.
You can't leave us here.
Hey, taxi!
Hi, Donald.
- You're late.
- Sorry I'm late, you guys.
You said that the last time
and the last five times.
You're late to your own group.
Hey! No!
Green!
I got a raise at the university,
you know. 34 cents an hour.
Nobody cares.
0f course it’s not technically
a monsoon, but...
14 inches of rain in 36 hours
is nothing to sneeze at...
even in Sri Lanka,
because...
They said my writing
was interesting per se...
but it doesn't meet their present needs
whatever that’s supposed to mean.
The Los Angeles Dodgers had
only 16 home games rained out...
in 41 years of baseball.
Nearly half of those rain games
occurred in the month of April...
and none have occurred
during the months of June...
or July.
I called by parents on the phone.
They're picking me up
at the bulletin board.
There's no bulletin board
at the park. You're screwed!
They'll never find you. Ever.
0kay, guys, we leave in 10 minutes
if we're going to make it to the park...
on time to meet the others.
It’s the 17 bus transfer to the 301.
Who needs tokens?
Come and get them.
They'll never find me. Ever.
Regular people lose autistic people
all the time. That’s just the way it is.
Gracie, can I see you
for a minute?
They'll never find me.
Ever.
Regular people lose autistic people
all the time. That’s just the way it is.
We'll buy you a cab.
I got a raise at the university,
you know. 34 cents an hour.
Yes?
Gracie, I'm gonna run the meeting
a little differently today.
I think that when
we get to the park...
I want you to gather
all the women...
and I'll gather all the guys
and go to the bleachers.
48 is interesting, because we add
the 4 and the 8 together you get 12.
If you flip 4 and 8 around, you get
84, and you subtract from 48...
you get 36, all of which
are exact multiplies of 12.
And 36 is interesting because
we add 3 and 6, we get 9...
and if you flip it around, you
get 63 and then, minus 36 is 27...
all of which are
exact multiplies of the 9.
- And now 144...
- Why will I gather all the women?
I want...
I want everybody to practice
telling personal stories.
And I think that people will be less
shy without the opposite sex...
...around. Do you think?
- I can tell them about my raise.
Bad idea.
Your raise is incredibly boring.
As a story, it lacks dramatic
tension and narrative drive.
You won't hear it.
You're not a girl.
I am, and I'm already bored!
Hey, somebody new signed up.
Isabelle Sorensen.
Gracie, maybe it’d be nice
if you let her start.
That way,
everybody can get to know her.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm new.
I don't really know what to say.
0kay, help me out.
Ask me a question.
The candy bar Baby Ruth
was named after the daughter...
of President Glover Cleveland.
He once worked as a hangman
in Buffalo, New York.
No. Don't distract with a lot of weird
ball stuff 'cause I get completely lost.
He was one of the presidents
who had illegitimate children...
together with Thomas Jefferson
and Warren G. Harding.
I don't get that. How do 3 guys
have children together?
They didn't even live
in the same century.
I do that.
I take things sort of literally.
<i>In fact, I remember when
I was a kid and my parents...</i>
<i>were watching the Olympics on TV
and this athlete broke a record.</i>
<i>And everybody was really excited.</i>
<i>And I thought: “Well, if that's all that
took to impress them, I can do that".</i>
<i>So I did.</i>
<i>The neighborhood kids saw
what I was doing...</i>
<i>and they started making
the loud noises that they knew.</i>
<i>I hated.</i>
Monster! Monster! Monster!
<i>So I started barking
like a dog because...</i>
<i>I can do that!</i>
Animals are different.
You can't teach them cruelty.
I don't know.
What else do you want me to say?
It’s always good, you guys, to start
a story somewhere near the beginning.
I grew up...
in a nice house.
By the time I was 2 years- old,
my parents basically got the drill.
I wasn't exactly what
they were looking for in a child.
I wasn't normal.
Quick. What’s 5,589
times 3,972 divided by 17?
1,305,853 point 411 etc.
See?
I told you.
You know, when McDonald’s
says 13 billion served...
it’s not that much. 0nly 43 visits
per person, per year...
which is once every 8,49... days.
It turns out
you can't control people...
or even predict them.
But numbers are different. As I use
to say, you can count on them.
People with Asperger's want contact
with other people very much.
We're just pathetically
clueless at it, that’s all.
When I was 14, I was on my own.
<i>So I used to hitchhike
to get around.</i>
<i>One day, this guy pulled over
In a pick- up truck...</i>
<i>and he said
that I had a pretty smile.</i>
<i>So, I got in.</i>
<i>And he raped me before
we got to the next town.</i>
You see, I thought that,
if I had sex with men...
they would want me
to be around them.
Why would you want that?
Because I've had sex
with women, sugar.
And it’s so dumb.
There's no thing!
0h, that’s disgusting!
Does anybody else have a...
Donald!
- Donald!
- Excuse me, guys.
Hey, why are you laughing?
I just told you I was raped.
Keep laughing, ladies.
I don't care what my shrink says.
I'm out of here!
Excuse me. Is there some kind
of confusion here?
This is no damn confusion,
this is a fight.
Hi, I'm Donald Morton.
We haven't met.
Can you tell the difference
between confusion and a fight...
or are you just as dingy
as they are?
Some of us aren't as functional
as the others...
but that’s no reason
to call anyone “dingy”.
Don't... Don't condescend
to this women.
They're no crazier than I am.
Yes, we are!
I'm weird,
but I'm not strange!
You're right. This is no matter of
confusion. It’s a matter of discord.
That’s a nice sweater.
Look, this is my first time
in your little fish tank...
and I'm just giving these women
a lesson from my heart...
which they sorely need.
So that’s all about self- esteem.
You can kiss my self- esteem butt,
Donald Duck!
Why tell your life story...
...and tell only the good parts?
- It’s Donald Morton.
You're missing my point!
No, I'm not.
I just never know what to say.
Neither do I.
We're quite the pair, huh?
What’s the point?
Not being alone.
Considering who we are,
what the hell is so great about that?
Her name's Isabelle Sorensen.
She's 8 letters
on each of her names.
I have 6 on each of mine.
So it must be good luck.
I don't know why I got so angry.
I guess I just do that.
He yelled right back at me, which
was pretty cool. Don't you think?
322. That’s another good sign.
That’s the number of days
she's older than me, times 3.
Which makes her 966 days
older than me.
He said that
he never knows what to say.
You ever knew a guy
who actually admit that?
It means we were both born
on Thursday.
0nly not the same Thursday.
Then again, he is autistic.
Did I tell you that he's tall?
Hey, Bongo.
It’s nice to obsess on something
beautiful, for a change.
<i>Hello. Hello?</i>
First I'd better get a machine,
don't you think?
I was the first one to join
after Donald formed the group.
He has Asperger's, you know.
Somebody told me that he's good
with numbers. Is that true?
Yes, he's very good.
But his numbers are...
- Really? What do you do?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm a writer.
- You write?
- Yeah.
But you shouldn’t read my writing
because it repels women.
...unless you count 19... 24...
with no record keeping a suspect.
0n the humidity front,
the only item on the note was in...
Hyderabad,
in the South of India.
Have you ever had real sex,
Gregory?
Excuse me.
Considering the season,
it’s something...
of attention, really.
What was weather like at the
second McKinley inaugural?
- That would’ve been...
- March 4th, 1901 A.D.
Big snow. High temperature's
17 degrees. 3.4 inches...
low temperature's minus 5 degrees.
What did you say to her?
I said I was a writer,
but she shouldn’t read my oeuvre...
as it repels women.
And then, what did she say?
Try me.
It figures.
She's coming
to the Halloween party with me.
That’s great.
Tell me about it.
I'm gonna go as Batman.
A whimsical commentary
on today's decaying popular culture.
- 0h, yeah? What’s she going as?
- Who cares?
- I do.
- Ask her.
- Ask her what she's going...
- Ask her if she'll come with me.
- I was seized by terror.
- I don't know if I can do that.
You both have Asperger's,
you both share the language...
of emotional dysfunction,
whereas I, on the other hand...
just irritate the shit out of everyone!
Even you.
She likes you though.
She laughed.
Everybody laughs at me. It doesn't
commit them to a Halloween party.
Please.
Look, I'm really sorry
about the other day.
That looks nice.
My cookie!
Can't eat my cookie!
- You can't do that!
- It’s my cookie!
That’s not okay!
It’s mine!
Stop! Stop!
It’s okay.
It’s okay.
It’s okay.
All right, I'm sorry.
But you can't do that.
I'm gonna call my parents now.
They'll pick me up
for the bulletin board.
Save it for later. Yeah.
I'll call my parents on the phone...
to pick me up at the bulletin board.
Hi, Donald.
You remember me?
Yes.
Good.
You know what Gregory
told me about you?
I'm good with numbers.
You spoiled my surprise.
- I take things literally.
- Me too.
0ne time, when I was 7 years old,
my dad took me to a diner...
for breakfast
and he said “Hominy grits”...
and I thought that
he said “how many”...
and I was supposed to count
how many there were.
- How many were there?
- 437.
That was a joke. It’s not that
I remember anything stupid...
as how many hominy grits.
I have to go now.
I gotta feed my animals.
I have six birds myself.
Isabelle, there's something I need to
talk to you about that’s important.
Are you free for lunch tomorrow?
Yes.
Good.
Bye.
- Bye!
- Bye.
Hi, Isabelle.
Hi, Isabelle. Hi.
Hi, Isabelle.
Isabelle, hello.
Izzy, I don't think he likes that.
Isn't that funny?
He's smiling.
He's smiling.
And see this?
This is a friendly gesture.
Show me yours, come on.
You know, a mandrill spends
two hours a day eating breakfast.
So, when you think about it,
that’s...
2,628,000 seconds
a year eating breakfast...
which only leaves him...
28 million... 908 thousand seconds
a year not to eat breakfast.
You know, I don't have to do numbers
all the time. I can control myself.
Don't stop.
Don't ever stop.
I love it.
That’s good, because I can't.
I know that. Neither can I.
We're autistic.
Like I can't stand the sound
of clanging metal.
If I hear it,
I completely freak out.
I learned a long time ago that I...
I can't...
keep from shocking people,
so I just make it work for me.
Sometimes.
I always say what I think.
Not because it’s good.
It’s just that I can't censor it.
The women at the park the other day,
I think I really freaked them out.
I hope that
they'll forgive me sometime.
Isabelle,
what you said about rape...
Rape is a very bad thing,
it’s never funny.
Not ever.
That’s your guts
speaking out just now.
Not really.
No, it did.
It did. It did.
Because you are attracted to me.
And you want to make
a good impression.
And guts makes
a really good impression.
This is how the birds are
in my apartment.
Mine too.
They're trying to evict me. Some
kind of phobia about animal poop.
That’s too bad.
I think that tonight we should
sneak back in here...
and set all the animals free,
except for the polar bears.
It’s too warm.
That was a joke.
So, it’s time!
You have something to tell me,
remember?
My friend Gregory wants to take you
to the Halloween party.
Is that it?
I don't go to the
Halloween party ever, so...
My friends dress up
on Halloween...
to hide who they really are.
And...
That’s sad, but credible.
I've a costume too.
At home.
But it reveals who I really am,
and nobody knows.
You take me to the party.
Wear your costume.
I would be so honored.
In fact, let’s not go to the party.
Just meet me at the mall.
Everyone is in costume,
they won't even notice us.
That’s what I love
about Halloween.
Hi, Isabelle. Hi.
Hoy, Hoy. Hello.
Hello, Isabelle.
Hello, Isabelle.
Isabelle.
I'm 9 hours and 37 minutes early.
Which is a good sign,
because that’s 577 minutes.
Prime number.
So, what’s up, Isabelle?
I'm late.
Which is ironic, because I started
out 9 hours and 23 minutes early.
You know what?
At this point...
probably better not to go at all,
you think?
I mean, she probably left already.
And if she didn't, she'll just be
really irritated when I show up.
And I wouldn’t know what to say.
You know how I get when
I don't know what to say.
Probably better not to go at all.
That’s our doorbell.
I'll be right back.
Nice whale costume.
- Dr. Mozart, I presume.
- Mozart wasn't a doctor.
Symphony 40, G Minor.
It’s about anger, passion,
and transcendence.
- Like you.
- Thanks.
I'm sorry I'm 63 minutes late.
I really was gonna come, I just...
That’s okay, I just figured
you screwed up. Come on.
So, I was going to take
the 303 bus instead of the 809.
And then I was thinking about
how 303 square is 91,809...
and the last 3 digits
are the same as 809, so...
I just forgot which one I was
gonna take. Then I thought...
Like I said!
I figured you screwed up.
Come on, we're going this way.
- So this is who you really are?
- Yeah.
This is so hot!
Are you in there?
Mr. Jonah!
What are you laughing at, toots?
At least my boyfriend is a vegetarian!
You have a boyfriend?
No, it’s a joke.
You are the vegetarian
because you're a whale.
Whales aren't vegetarians.
They eat krill.
- So why is that?
- Because they're tiny shrimp.
That you're a whale?
For lots of reasons.
Name six.
- For one, they're very big.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- And...?
All my life I kind of felt
I was on the sidewise...
like watching the parade go by.
When you are a whale,
you are the parade.
I bet you know all about whales.
- Yes.
- Well, tell me.
Well, it’s a very long story.
Well, the last bus isn't
for another two hours...
47 minutes and three...
No, two, one.
0ne second.
Quick, Donald, tell me!
Well, the bus is coming.
Yep.
So, Donald, this is our first kiss.
No tongue.
Why don't you take this thing off?
You don't need it anymore.
I'm not quite so sure
what I'm wearing underneath.
Well, what the hell?
Let’s lift it up.
0kay, Mr. Whale, you can go.
Just there.
That’s nice.
That was a mix up
at the laundromat.
0n second thought, maybe
we should have some tongue.
Call me!
When?
When should I call you?
Hey, move.
0kay, move.
Sit down.
All right, just don't bite me.
Honey, scoot.
<i>Long messages are cheerfully
ignored. Get it over with.</i>
<i>This is Donald Morton.
This is my eighth message.</i>
At least.
<i>Hey, I'm sorry I called
so many times, but...</i>
<i>you didn’t say when to call, so I...</i>
<i>Well, listen,
I won't bother you anymore.</i>
That’s what you said the last time.
<i>I just wanted to say again
I had a whale a time last night...</i>
<i>and I...</i>
<i>I understand.
I really do.</i>
<i>And I'm always gonna
remember you...</i>
<i>and the times we had...</i>
<i>and...</i>
Donald Duck!
<i>You're home.</i>
I didn't call because I didn't
really know what to say to you.
Donald, I don't know where
you and I could ever go.
<i>We can go to the amusement park.</i>
Donald, you can see everything
from up here!
Look at the sky.
It’s the same color as my jacket!
- I'm sure it’s amazing.
- It is. Especially to the East...
where the sun's setting.
- Actually, the sun sets on the West.
- Will stop making conversation?
This is somewhat disappointing.
Just open your eyes, it’s great!
It’s kind of like in the arcade.
When I want to factor a number...
I just...
I visualize it...
going across my eyes.
Pick a number.
589.
0kay. So then I shoot
prime numbers at it, so...
3 won't go into it and
5 won't go in it.
It won't even have a chance
because it doesn't end in a 5 or a 0.
And then...
You know, 7, 11.
19. When I shoot 19,
it breaks into two...
19 and 31.
Your process if very sexual.
Primes are hot.
I like you.
You're so smart!
So cool!
You wanna know the secret
to this one? It’s good.
You see, you just...
you throw them all
at the same time, just...
No, don't...
Stop it!
Stop it!
Excuse me.
Hey, it’s okay.
It’s okay.
We won a panda.
We got 4 rings on them.
Can we go home now?
Don't freak out!
It’s okay, I'm better now.
I was talking to them.
Hello!
Come on, sweet baby.
Don't worry,
I'm just talking to him.
- That’s Cockatoo Dundee.
- Hey, Dundee.
That’s Ricky, and that’s Lucy.
That’s Piyachi, Chicken Boo.
And this is Don Juan de Marco.
Let's have a look
around the house, guys.
I save things because
you never know. You know?
You said your mom died.
You did bury her?
- Yeah.
- Just checking.
Let’s sit down, huh?
0kay, guys.
Come on.
That’s it.
Come on.
All right.
You can sit here.
You want to sit here?
Come on. There you go.
You can get off too now.
See, you can go here.
There you are.
You want something to eat?
You got any old food in the fridge?
I got lots of old food.
You like old food?
Donald.
This is about sex.
I'm sorry.
Was that a little abrupt?
It’s just that I haven't had any...
in a long, long time.
Yeah.
I had an instinct there.
But sex is gonna be terrific.
It’s the most fun you can have
with your clothes off.
I'm sure you've been
with more attractive men.
Are you kidding me?
You are so hot.
Anyway, attraction
is a whole package.
And I've never been
with anyone like you.
You mean the hygiene?
You know how many guys
would take me home...
after that show at the ring toss?
Plenty.
Well, they wouldn’t be there
in the morning.
I'll be there in the morning.
I live here.
Is there a pathway
to your bedroom?
You want to go?
Now?
Yeah.
You know how
in the jungle they say that...
some elephants have longer trunks
and some of them have shorter ones?
Well, I don't care how long
the elephant 's trunk is...
as long as his thing's okay.
Sweetie, you can't disappoint me.
'Cause whatever you are...
is exactly what I want.
Isabelle!
You know, at first, I was upset
that she didn't even leave a note!
Then I realized that was a kindness.
She's a sweet person.
Why hurt my feelings, you know?
The less said, the better,
you think?
So we just tuck it away, you know.
Just leave it.
She said a lot of beautiful things.
The fact that she didn't mean it
only makes it nicer.
I mean, what was she gonna say?
“Thanks for the lousy sex?”
Are you talking about me?
I just had to go home
and feed my animals.
You know what I think
we should do today?
Buy you a nice suit.
Sure.
This is my best friend, Bongo.
“Hello!”
- I'm just doing the dishes.
- Cool.
Yeah...
cool.
Here they are.
Yeah. He's coming.
He is coming.
Where have you been?
I thought our friends deserved to
know the truth of your treachery.
- I believe in the truth.
- You believe in gossip.
Are you sleeping with him?
Janice, that’s a personal question.
Sure, is that okay with you?
Don't you hate all his numbers?
Does he change his socks?
Is his penis big enough?
No, no, and yes.
Would you take me to the movies
on Sunday at 5?
Janice, Sundays
I'm with Isabelle. Sorry.
This is a classic vicious betrayal,
very common in literature!
And life.
Hey.
Nice to see you again, Gregory.
It’s very nice to smell you.
As you all know...
Isabelle and I have been seeing
each other since Halloween.
And maybe we should talk
about how you feel about this.
It’s sexual harassment!
That’s a very serious accusation!
You used your position to extort
sexual favors, you should be replaced.
My sister's a lawyer.
Gregory, Donald and I are just
getting to know each other.
- So, you can still date me?
- Right now, I just wanna see Donald.
So, when you're sick of him,
you can date me?
Skeets, let’s hear from you.
Do you have any questions
about me and Isabelle?
There are 200 to 300 million sperm
cells in the average ejaculation.
Penguins mate only once a year...
and it lasts 3 minutes.
I think they're extremely sexy.
You wanna know why?
I'm only gonna tell you
if you wanna know.
- I wanna know.
- I don't, and that’s for sure.
Skeets?
When penguins are reunited after
a long separation...
they stand breast to breast
their heads are thrown back...
and their little flippers are trembling
and they sing, Skeets...
because they're so happy
to find each other.
Gracie, how do you feel?
I feel sad.
About me and Isabelle?
Bronwin's daddy has blood cancer.
Regular people get sick too,
not just autistic people...
that’s just the way it is.
Yeah, but these days lots of people
get better from chemotherapy and...
I have to go now. My parents are
meeting me at the bulletin...
The meeting just started.
Maybe your parents will be there...
...in a little while.
- Would you like me to go with you?
We could call your parents
and we could wait together...
by the bulletin board.
I'd like to do that.
I'll go too.
Not today.
- Can I go to the funeral?
- I'm not going, and that’s for sure.
Donald!
All right.
Just for one day, nobody shit.
Yuck!
That is so gross!
Izzy, I'm home!
0h, no.
What did you do?
Where's my stuff?
Did you hear, Izzy?
Everything's here.
It’s just organized.
I thought you'd like it.
Well, now I know where everything
is, so you'd better be nice to me...
or I'll take the secret
to my grave.
Where's my shower curtain, huh?
I threw it out.
What? God!
Well, I called the Center
for Disease Control in Atlanta...
but it was more
than they could handle.
It was mine!
This is all my stuff!
You had no right to do this!
I thought you'd like it.
You stole my life.
285410.
Got the 2,85.
- Trying to get yourself killed?
- Maybe later.
H- Lime.
What’s that supposed to mean?
Harry Lime. 0rson Welles.
“The Third Man”.
It’s a movie.
Your plate’s better.
You can trade the letters for
Roman numerals, that’s 215.
If you add the one, that’s 216.
That’s 6 cubed.
27 is 3 cubed.
I'm doing all the numbers
in the parking lot.
It helps calming me down.
- Did you lose your job?
- No, my woman.
And my shower curtain.
What’s your social security number?
Stop calling!
<i>Hi. This is my 14th message.</i>
<i>Listen, I respectfully think
you should change your greeting...</i>
<i>in case you get called
by your boss.</i>
<i>Seriously, I'm fine now.</i>
<i>And I'm sorry I spoiled our evening.
I am really, really sorry.</i>
<i>It could never ever happen again.</i>
<i>I mean, to hell
with the shower curtain.</i>
Hey.
Sorry.
Everyone...
this is my boyfriend.
Donald Morton.
0h, the shower curtain.
Mac Farraday.
Brenda Mackey.
Wanda...
my mentor.
I bought him this suit.
It was on sale. Hey.
0ne of the reasons
that I cleaned your apartment...
0h, boy, it’s great.
The cleaner the better,
that’s what I say.
It’s so that we can have
our friends over, Donald!
Izzy, we don't have friends
who come over. Ever.
Yeah. Want to guess why?
Not really.
Donald?
Izzy.
This is the most peaceful...
the most beautiful place
that I know.
And the world doesn't want it
anymore, so they left it to me.
To us.
This is a special place
that’s just for us.
You know what we need?
We need a little house
with a yard...
so that we can plant flowers
and sit in the shade...
and kiss under the stars.
The heavens are very
important to me. So...
I found this tiny place...
and the rent isn't gonna cost any
more than what we're already paying...
with our two apartments.
Izzy, I got fired, remember?
Dr. Jeffries is the woman at the
university who diagnosed me. And...
I was telling her about how
you organized this group...
of lonely people
that everybody else ignores.
I only did that because
I was lonely too.
I was telling her how much
you care for them...
and how much
they love you...
because this is the real work
of your life, Donald...
only nobody pays you.
So I asked her
if she could find you a job...
at the university that would enable
you to continue...
...this invaluable...
- You did what?
And she said yes, yes, yes!
Izzy, they don't have cabs
at the University Medical Center.
Donald Duck,
it comes down to this:
do you want to make me happy?
For one thing, I understand
you're a mathematical genius.
Who said that?
Dr. Jeffries recommended
that I called...
Isabelle Sorensen.
I hope that was all right.
It’s her fault
that I'm here in the first pace.
And after everything she told me and
checking on your excellent record...
in college I'm wondering why you
choose to drive a taxi for a living.
At my interview with IBM
after I graduated college...
they asked me what
my plans were and I said:
“Probably go to McDonald’s
for a12- piece McNugget...
and 2 cheeseburgers
and then do my laundry”.
Did they laugh at least?
They smiled and
they said they'd call me.
They didn't.
Mr. Morton, I run Administrative
Services for the Medical Center.
Your profile is a plus because
we want to give opportunities to...
people with special needs.
You can say “autistic”,
I already know.
“Touché”.
The job would be looking at statistical
runs finding inconsistencies.
Telling me where the computer got it
wrong. You can do that, can't you?
Well, sure.
Well, I can't, and neither can
anybody else I've ever met. So...
I'm blessed to have you.
Where do you want me to put him?
- Donald!
- What?
Prepare to die!
0kay. Ready?
- No.
- Yes, you are.
- No.
- It’s gonna be fine
0kay. Scissors.
First, water. Ready?
0ne, two, three.
- Water.
- No, no, no.
- Donald, chill!
- No.
Come on, it’s gonna be fine.
Come here.
- Hello!
- Hi.
Nice day, huh?
I think they're the neighbors.
It’s too expensive, Dundee.
It’s too expensive.
All right.
Have a good day.
Bye.
Isabelle, there's something
I need to talk to you about that...
sometimes you find...
kind of enraging.
- 0h, yeah?
- Yeah.
Try me.
Tonight, when my boss
comes here for dinner...
I just want everything to be...
really nice.
You know?
He's a really good person,
and I really like my job.
- I just want everything...
- To be nice.
- Yeah.
- 0kay.
Have a nice day at work.
You too.
Bye!
Izzy, we're home!
Can you shut the door?
I told her to put everybody in his
or her cages respectively, but...
she didn't, and...
Come on, you guys. Come on.
Come on, you guys.
Stay, stay. Come on.
There she is.
Izzy!
All the birds were out.
Hank Wallace, Isabelle.
Nice to put a face with the voice.
That’s right. We talked about
what a genius Mr. Morton is.
Not to mention a saint.
Well, only this morning...
he advised me to be on my very
tippy- toed best behavior tonight...
so I don't weird you out.
So feel free to advise me
if I deviate from normality...
at anytime.
Sense of humor.
We're working on it.
- Do you like vegetable lasagna?
- Sure.
How about a beer?
See you inside!
It’s great vegetable lasagna.
I don't pretend to be
an expert, but...
That’s great! 'Cause I hate it
when people do that.
But your paintings are impressive.
0h, yeah.
Thank you.
Most people want me to paint
something else, you know...
with fewer eyes,
Less violent, less insane.
I used to tell Donald that
I wanted him to hear my paintings...
and see my music
'cause I wanted him...
to understand them
like other people couldn’t.
She doesn't understand that I can.
And I do.
And most people do.
It’s pretty normal.
I'm basically a failure, Hank.
In the material world
I used to be a piano tuner.
- She's perfect pitch.
- I made good money.
It’s a valued trade, but half the clients
hit on me, and the other half...
would say something stupid enough
to where I'd blurt out something rude.
I say things as I think them,
you know?
0ut loud, most of the times.
Can't hold my temper and, arrogant,
impatient, and I don't suffer fools.
I have a good heart,
believe it or not...
but it doesn't pay so good, so...
I'm lucky that I have a wonderful
guy who's also very generous.
Did he tell you about
our plans for the house?
Well, they're not exactly plans
that we plan to implement...
Just maybe ideas, more...
We're going to put this big sandbox
right here in the living room...
so people and animals can play...
Whatever!
And then, outside we're going
to put this big aviary...
so birds and lizards and Bongo
can hang out.
- Have you met Bongo?
- No, not officially.
Have you noticed that winters are
coming later and later every year?
- I like that.
- Have you?
And it was actually
Donald’s idea that we put...
a piano in the yard so that all the
local animals can listen to me play.
It must be global warming.
Interrupting is not the way
to become the focus of attention...
it’s very autistic.
Where was I?
The walls.
So I'm gonna paint them in this
one- of- a- kind savage colors...
and get fabrics to put
all over the carpet and stuff...
that scream jungle, you know?
And then...
right up there, by the doorway,
I wanna put this whale- shaped thing...
that you have to walk through,
and then eventually...
a full- size aquarium because obviously
we love birds, but we also love fish.
How are we gonna pay for all this?
My boss is going
to think that we're crazy.
Who got you that job
in the first place?
You only got it for me
so I could get you this house...
and these luxuries.
Well, it’s obvious we don't share
the same dreams.
That job was for you. And I pushed,
and I sweet- talked you into it...
because I knew that you would never
go down there by yourself.
But it was all for you,
so you could be proud of yourself!
I have put up with an array of stuff
from you that no one should tolerate...
because I thought that
you would do the same for me.
But you made me feel like a freak.
Behave for your boss?
Suddenly this is coming from who,
Mr. Whale Costume? Mr. Toxic Toilet!
What about the show
that you put on in there?
Did you do one thing the entire night
that was even halfway normal?
No. Because I was mad and,
sadly, I was just being myself.
0h, that’s yourself?
That’s yourself?
That’s the whole point,
Donald Duck.
You're just one more guy who sees
who I really am and can't handle it.
It broke my heart to see
how scared you were.
- Scared?
- Bringing home your boss to prove...
that you're normal by showing off
your smart pretty little wife?
0nly he saw that she was
just as crazy as you are.
Crazier!
Crazier!
There's one difference
between us, Donald.
You want to be normal.
You crave it.
And that is what broke us up.
I'm leaving now.
I don't want you here
when I get back.
I don't want you here ever,
or you will regret it!
<i>So I got an unlisted number,
but there was no other way.</i>
<i>I can picture you still calling
every three minutes...</i>
<i>hoping for some electronic miracle.</i>
<i>I'm...
I'm not mad anymore, Donald.</i>
<i>I'm okay.</i>
<i>So don't obsess
on all that stuff I said.</i>
Does she have any idea
who she's talking to?
<i>I've never been able to stay
with any guy for very long...</i>
<i>so I knew I'd end up
breaking your heart.</i>
<i>A piece of advice:
set a limit on...</i>
<i>how many times you play this.
Like 20.</i>
<i>- And then erase it, okay?
- That’s 32 times that I've heard.</i>
It doesn't cost anything.
Don't worry.
I won't go out with her.
I could never do that to you.
Who would go whale- watching?
It’s a wholesome activity,
and the weather should be ideal.
But I'm foreseeing conditions
to the contrary, such as a...
Low pressure front which
could really have the boat...
rocking and rolling.
The ocean is five hours away.
Yeah, but whales
are Donald’s favorite thing.
And it would cheer him up
from Isabelle dumping him.
I'm not going, and that’s for sure.
But you could be
the cruise lecturer.
It’s a very prestigious position.
0r perhaps contrast
the administrations of...
Chester A. Arthur and
Millard Filmore or whatever!
Seven. Just two more
for the group rate.
Let’s watch a whale.
It’s on Sunday.
Sunday I see my daddy in the hospital.
That’s just the way it is.
I could call Isabelle.
She doesn't hate me.
I have a list of friends.
Some of them are women.
I know why you like living with me.
I'm neater than Isabelle.
You're neater than me,
tied up in Bloom and that’s it.
I file my food.
Nobody does that.
Can I give you some advice?
Can I humanly stop you?
Stick with the group.
Compared to us, you're a god.
And next to Isabelle,
which you will never meet again...
you don't come off so hot.
We can't hear you!
You got a message.
- You got 17 of them.
- Actually...
they're not for me.
<i>Donald.
Donald, please be there, please.</i>
<i>Goddamnit, he's dead, Donald.</i>
<i>Donald, Bongo died.</i>
<i>- That’s her rabbit.
- Where are you?</i>
I'm so glad you came.
I don't know why I went
over the edge.
I lost pets all my life.
What?
I missed you.
You never came for the birds
or the whale.
God, you must have missed them.
If I took them away,
this wouldn’t be my home anymore.
Be my friend, Donald.
Be my best friend, please,
because I really need you.
And I always felt you wanted us
to get married or something.
- Did I ever say that?
- Not in words.
But instead of that,
do you want to just be my friend?
- Without the sex?
- Without the pressure.
My friendship is all I have to give.
Do you want it?
0f course.
That makes me so happy.
Yeah, but how do you know
that she knows what she wants?
I mean, you didn't see the way
that she was looking at me.
That’s because I wasn't there.
Yeah, but she was talking
about marriage.
To tell you that she didn't want to.
Yeah, but I didn't bring it up.
She did.
And when I brought up sex,
she didn't exactly say no.
When women want sex,
they usually say yes!
- Why are you saying this?
- Donald!
Donald! Donald!
If there's one thing I know
it’s chicks.
That was a good load.
Good drier, good pace.
Yeah, but...
Did you fix your tie?
Your table is ready.
Right this way.
This is so pretty, Donald.
Look, there's a little fish.
There's three. Hello!
Your chair, miss.
And may I take your coat?
- Yes, thank you.
- You're welcome.
- And here's your menu.
- Thank you.
The waiter will be with you soon.
- And have a wonderful evening.
- Thanks.
This is completely irrational.
I'm very impressed.
- Izzy!
- 0h, my gosh!
This is gonna cost you a fortune.
He told me this is
the best food in town.
I wanted the place
to be special because...
I have something special
to talk about.
- Is it a surprise?
- Good evening.
What is it?
What is it?
Donald?
- Anything from the bar?
- Go away! What?
- What is it? Tell me! Tell me!
- Take your time. I'll come back to...
...talk about the specials.
- What is it?
Izzy...
I don't think you know
what you want.
You got us a house,
and you got me the job.
And we keep fighting...
but you keep bringing me back
into your life.
And today you brought up marriage,
and I think that you want that.
And I want that too, because...
you're my only chance,
and I want that chance.
That’s very freaking flattering.
You are my only chance
because I love you.
And I'm your only chance
because you love me too.
Marry me, Isabelle.
- Thanks for taking the pressure off!
- Isabelle, don't freak out!
- No. You're just like all the others.
- No, I'm not like all the others.
I don't want you to save me!
I just want to be left alone!
185. Why did I have
to ask her to marry me?
0kay.
0kay.
47, 48.
No, I got to go home.
I got to tell her not to marry me.
Izzy, we got to talk!
Izzy, where are you?
Donald? I'm Dr. Jeffries,
Isabelle's psychiatrist.
- Are you okay?
- Is she okay?
I signed the release, and she left.
- Is that safe?
- She's going to be fine.
She'll be in therapy.
She doesn't need therapy.
She's not crazy.
Donald, she needs someone
to listen to her.
I'll go home and I'll listen.
I'm an excellent listener.
I'll improve.
No, I won't.
Well, Asperger's is a funny animal.
Can I go home now?
Donald.
I don't want you to see her,
I don't want you to call her.
And neither does she. 0kay?
Look at it this way.
She tried to kill herself because
he wouldn’t stop calling her.
No. She tried to kill herself
because I wanted to marry her.
It’s completely different!
If I were you,
I would ask me for advice.
Don't play her little game.
Write a story about how she was
eaten by Peruvian fire ants...
and then run over by a car,
and then fax it to her.
She's expecting me to call.
If I don't, she's gonna go crazy...
and think that
I don't love her anymore!
I'm gonna find another phone.
I know the number.
Is it as good as the number,
say, 2- 8- 0- 9?
2809 is 53 squared
and 5 + 3 is 8.
The cubed root of 8 is 2,
which is her dress size.
I bought her this beautiful dress
the other day that has flowers on it.
6.
It’s not a richly textured number...
but it is her shoe size.
She has beautiful feet.
You guys, I know her
better than anybody!
I know that she needs me to call.
What if the doctor is right,
and you call and she kills herself?
And then you'll regret it
for the rest of your life.
How am I going to stop myself?
What do you wear
when you stop smoking?
A nicotine patch.
9- 6- 6- 0.
No, I can't!
No!
Excuse me, do you know
when the next bus 217 runs?
- Sorry.
- I'm chasing someone.
- By bus?
- Well, it’s important.
Important enough to take the bus.
My girlfriend left me because...
I wanted to get married and
she wanted to stay just friends.
The slower this chase, the better.
Stop the bus!
All this time, and you didn't call.
I was going to call.
You were?
Well, just to tell you that I wasn't
going to call so you wouldn’t...
be aggravated, sitting around
and wondering when I was...
Going to call?
Yeah.
But in the end I figured that...
forcing myself into your life
was probably not right.
I don't always do that.
So the only nice thing I had left
to give was just not to call.
I hated you for not calling...
'cause you were always going to
be there and when you weren't...
it was as if...
you didn't love me anymore.
So go home.
I'll call you.
I can't promise you the future,
Donald Duck.
I don't know if this is
for 2 days or 20 years.
Finally, there's something
about us that’s normal.
I missed you so much.
All right, look at what Donald made.
I'm hungry!
- Delicious.
- Thanksgiving.
- Stop it!
- Blume, don't, don't. Blume...
All right, so I wanted
to thank Donald...
who made this amazing lunch and...
I just wanted to thank you all
for coming, because...
you are our family.
And I...
Well, we love you.
Hear, hear!
Wait, wait. This is to...
Donald Morton...
my husband.
Cheers!
I love you!
Anyone want gravy?
