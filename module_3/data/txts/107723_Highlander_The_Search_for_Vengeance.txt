Don't you ever quit?
Get lost.
You're the one who's lost.
At least you're persistent.
You too.
Who the fuck are you?
I'm looking for someone.
You got balls...
But no brains.
I am Malike.
Have you come to take my head,
or just collect the reward?
You're not who I want.
Ain't that a shame?
...Cuz I'm the one you got.
No one has to die today.
Don't.
Wrong.
Get it! Do it!
I lived a thousand years, boy!
I killed a hundred like you.
There can be only one!
Time to die.
Kill him!
Would be long!
No, this can't be!
Who are you?!
Colin MacLeod.
Of the Clan MacLeod.
Beautiful.
...but not perfect.
Just like this city.
A quickening!
An immortal has lost his head.
Feeling better?
Taking his head and his power
must have really turned you on.
Shut up!
You're lucky I'm already dead...
...or that could have killed me.
You're trespassing. You're either a citizen
of the city with a travel pass, or you're dead.
Which is it?
Careful, pal.
Check him.
What's in the bag?
Oh wha-damn!
I'll take my money.
Malike's killer has come to
collect his reward...
What do you think?
About the sculpture...
or Malike's killer?
Here's your money.
Now, you're to come with me.
Why?
Our commander wants to
thank you, personally.
Tell him to write me a letter.
I have my orders.
Discretion is the better part of valor!
Buzz off.
What happened here?
The virus killed most of them.
Floods, pollution, and bad
genetic engineering did the rest.
The virus kill rate is about 80%.
You wanna keep your ass safe,
you'll need to get vaccinated.
Not my problem.
Hey, just some friendly advice.
Unless of course, you'd rather be dead.
Like them, out there.
Whatever.
This is fine. I'll get out here.
Yeah, this isn't a cab, friend.
I'm not your friend.
Yeah? Well,
maybe you'd rather be dead.
Fuck you!
Man, who are you!
I'm Joe.
And around here, I'm the man.
Whatever you need, I got.
Food, clean water, a woman...
Whiskey.
Hey, that's easy!
Rudy's Bar, down by the pier.
Look for the cow's head.
Just tell 'em Joe sent you.
Whoa! Thanks a lot!
Hey, what's your name anyways?
Colin.
Did you see that?!
He kicked their asses.
And he gave me a hundred bucks.
Huh, useless.
Just useless.
Dahlia?
All the money in the world
won't buy you a vaccine.
Just leave the bottle.
Yo, Dahlia, you're late.
Not today.
You got two choices.
You can give it up, or...
I can take it.
That's a good girl.
Now...
You got two choices, Freddy.
You can leave now...
or, you can carry your little
friends home in a paper cup.
- You...!
- Go home, Freddy.
Whatever.
Ahh, thanks.
How's business?
It sucks. We are losing ground.
Yeah, I hear ya.
If someone doesn't give, and
soon already, we're all dead.
Hey. You don't need that.
All you need is me.
What did you say?
I said... you don't need that.
All you need, is me.
And if you need more of an invitation than that,
you're not the man I thought you were.
Oi! To our fearless leader!
...Who has less trouble conquerin' Romans...
than he does his wife!
That'll be enough of that!
To freedom!
To glory!
In the name of honor!
Honor!
Now we have our own business to
take care of.
...do we now?
We do.
As the gods are my witness,
I will love no other,
till the day I die.
...which will be tomorrow.
Marcus Octavius
leads 2,000 legionnaires.
You lead 400.
You have no chance.
Well... then how about giving me
a proper farewell.
You think this is a joke?
When my father chose you to lead us,
it was not supposed to be to our deaths.
You think he'd want us to run?
He'd want us to live.
Live, yes. But not as slaves.
He'd never want us to live as slaves.
Moya, our lives are a small price
to pay for our honor.
Then let us drink to our victory.
To victory.
I love you.
You are my life.
Colin.
Moya.
Moya...
...forgive me.
What's yer business, woman!
The name is Moya.
And my business is with Marcus Octavius,
and not his watchdog.
Haw! I could rape and kill you,
and no one would care.
That's enough.
Yes, sir!
Do you read, Moya?
No.
Pity. There are things men have written
with such beauty and wisdom.
So... beauty and wisdom.
Can they tell me why Rome
must destroy my people?
Because it is the way of nature.
We are the superior civilization.
One day, the entire world will know
the peace of Rome.
Mm. You Romans, you talk of peace
when all you do is kill.
I know you're not here
just to insult me.
I am here to beg for the lives
of my people.
Generally such requests are
accompanied by a tribute.
Truly, a gift from the gods.
And, my people?
They are already destroyed.
Our destiny must be served.
Then...
Serve this!
It can't be!
Such a waste!
I could have given you Rome.
But now, you will watch
everything you love...
...die. Tonight.
No!
God...
give me strength...
Moya!
Moya... it's me!
Can you hear me!
Oh god, come back!
Colin?
Moya!
You're alive...
Oh... gods be praised...
Oh Moya!
I have to get you out of here!
Colin. Swear.
Colin, you must swear to me...
...you will not seek revenge.
It will only bring you death!
No.
Colin... Swear to me!
Swear to me!
I swear.
Oh Colin, I love you.
I swear, I swear,
they will pay for this.
I will revenge you all.
I told you, you don't need that.
What you need, is me. Huh?
...what?
Nothing, just... go away.
Look mister. I saw what you did
on the street, ok?
They'll be coming back.
Dozens of 'em.
You wanna live, come with me.
Alright. Trust me, don't trust me.
You're the one who'll be dead.
Hey mister, sounds like
you better trust someone.
This'll only take a minute.
You think anyone's listening?
I take it you don't believe in God?
Take a look around. If there is one,
he's an uncaring, sadistic bastard.
Don't blame God.
Global warming, war, pollution...
If it looks like hell to you,
we did it to ourselves.
Hey, I know it stinks here.
If we could get rid of the assholes that
control this city, we might have a chance.
<i>Nonstop, nonstop...
ticket to your destination...</i>
<i>Please do not stop... a ticket...</i>
Terrorist incidents have dropped 15%
in the last quarter.
Pacification is almost complete.
Next on the agenda,
city expansion to 14th Street.
As you will note, we are on schedule. The military
has assured us there will be no resistance.
Here are our latest modifications...
pending your approval.
I'll look at these later.
Commander.
Was there something you wanted?
Where are we?
I hope we are still on track.
Yes, the thing is...
If I remember correctly,
you promised completion today.
I understand, sir. However...
...in a chemical reaction of
this complexity...
...there are variables that unless understood
and controlled could lead to catastrophy.
You have until the end of the day.
But sir!
I was a little slow today. Sorry.
Ah, but the stroke was perfect.
And you... are perfect.
But I was nothing, til you found me.
Remember?
Of course.
Are you... god?
Close enough.
You're immortal!
You will serve me for eternity.
Besides, you really are much
too beautiful to kill.
You have taught me everything.
You are my lover, my world.
...my destiny!
Show me your gratitude.
What is it?
Commander,
Malike's killer has escaped.
Find him.
Kill him if you have to, but I want
his head attached to his shoulders.
Yes, sir!
Should I help them?
No, this is more important.
C'mon, this way.
It's a secret entrance.
Soldiers can't track us down here.
Welcome to our world!
I'm still hungry.
Sorry, we're out,
more's coming in tomorrow.
We still have soup!
I hate rat soup...
Your call.
You got mustard?
Yeah, you got it.
Gotcha!
Why do you live down here?
Only the obedient assholes live in the tower,
and they run the whole damn city.
Those bastards also control the vaccine.
Fewer get sick underground,
it betters our chances.
Dahlia!
You're back!
Doc, how's Sarah doing?
Not good.
Without vaccine,
maybe she's got a couple days.
Damn.
This the guy all the commotion's about?
Let's go.
Home.
C'mon in.
Scotch, gin, bourbon.
Help yourself.
Why did you bring me here?
Can't you guess? Most of my
customers look like Freddy.
Let's just say...
...I'll give you the house discount.
Why don't you take it easy?
You don't seem like the shy type.
Like what you see?
C'mon, it's free... whatever you want.
I wanna know the real reason
why I'm here.
No big deal.
I just need a little help.
Hey, wait, I need your help!
Would you just hold on a minute! I want you to help
me break into the tower and steal some vaccine.
We lost our source inside!
They killed him!
People are dying, don't you care?
No. I don't.
Wait!
Wow, that didn't work.
Yo! Hey!
Wait up!
<i>This is all it takes. Now, let
us build our perfect world together</i>
<i>I will make your dreams come true!</i>
Please, just stop!
<i>All in a world of safety, beauty...</i>
I've got money, I can pay you!
<i>...and prosperity.</i>
<i>Your obedience is all it takes.</i>
Marcus!
What? Don't tell me you know him!
<i>Let us build our perfect world.</i>
He's the asshole that owns us.
Bring him to me.
Why are you here?
Answer me.
You crucified Moya!
Moya?
What a pity to waste such beauty.
She was yours then?
Tell you what.
Kill me, and you live.
Cut him loose!
Leave him! He's mine.
He lies on holy ground.
You are a lucky bastard.
It took you long enough!
Are you... a sorcerer?
No. Now, I am just a spirit.
I was once a druid priest,
and I was called...
Amergan.
- Where are you going?
- To kill a Roman!
Aren't you at least mildly curious...
...as to why you still live?
By the way... How's that gash
in that head of yours?
- I'm healed!
- You, my friend, are immortal.
You will live forever,
unless someone cuts off your head.
And I'd lay down that sword,
if I were you.
Well, if I'm immortal, then
what have I got to worry about?
Pain.
Pain still hurts.
Are we ready to listen?
We have much to discuss.
You have been given a rare gift!
You will live to see civilizations
rise and fall.
You will know a thousand joys and...
a thousand heartaches.
My friend, the Romans have gone.
What?
Gone where?
There are other immortals,
like yourself.
When they draw close, you will feel them,
even before you see them.
Just like you felt Marcus.
I did.
He is immortal,
and he's been a warrior for centuries.
You will have no chance against him.
Where is he! Tell me! Tell me!
He will take your head, and your quickening.
That's what all immortals are searching for.
The life force, the energy that flows
from your body after you are beheaded.
Immortals will fight until only
one of you remains alive.
But you can never kill on holy ground...
...so you are safe, for now.
Where is he!
He was part of your mortal life.
That life is over.
It will be over when he's dead!
Oh, and another small thing.
Immortals can't have children.
So my friend! Your quiver...
...has no arrows.
Tell me now... Or by the gods,
I will crush you!
They leave from Dover...
You're too late.
No!
Your life has just begun!
Why are you in such a hurry to die?
Holy shit!
Where is he!
What?
What's he to you?
Where is he!
He's up there.
Forget about it, ok? Security's too tight,
and half the army's looking for your ass.
Unless you know how to get in...
...like I do.
Remember your promise.
Once the vaccine's safe,
you can do what you want.
Joe! What the hell
are you doin' here?
Sarah's dying. I'm going with you.
No, you're not.
You'll just be in the way.
Joe, no one's ever made it.
Doc was lucky, ok,
he only lost his leg.
My choice.
Keep quiet!
What the...!
Shit!
It's off!
Run. Now.
I'm sorry about the watch!
Forget it! Run!
This way!
Dahlia!
Dahlia! You ok?
I'm fine.
He is one tough son of a bitch.
Man, you are unreal!
You sure you know where you're going?
Yeah, the city's right above us?
Should be right...
There!
Bad timing.
Just stay put it...
Whoa, he's amazing!
Yeah, but not very subtle.
Let's keep moving.
Here goes nothing.
Nobody moves!
If you wanna live, put your
hands behind your heads.
Do it!
What exactly do you think you're doing?
We're here for the vaccine. Where is it!
No, no, I'll do what you want!
For god's sake, stop firing!
Did we lose viral containment?
No, sir. We're safe.
All sensors are negative
What was that about?
What?
This has gotta be it...
I found it! It's the vaccine!
Put it in here.
I got it.
Hey, what in there?
You said it was viral.
Why is there virus in there?
Don't! You do that, and everyone
within 50 miles dies.
Oh, it's perfection... A perfect virus
with a contagion and kill rate of 100%.
What the hell is it doing down here?
No...! It can't be...!
Son of a bitch.
You've been making it all along,
right here?
You've been making us sick.
Killing us.
I was under orders.
Why? How could you do that?
Because this is how it is...
in Rome.
This isn't fucking Rome!
This is New York!
It seems that security is aware
of your presence.
Now, drop your weap...
We're outta here.
I'm ready. Let's go.
What now?
Dahlia!
Shit. Run!
Where's he going?
I don't know!
Wait! Colin!
Colin!
Don't go!
Don't leave us!
You've never been that bright,
but at least you weren't an arsehole.
Sometimes I think you're as dense
as a piece of wood.
I thought for a minute there that you'd
give up this lunacy to do something noble.
But no.
Not now. Not ever.
I beg you! Help us!
Where is Marcus Octavius!
You can have all of it!
Just lead us to safety!
Don't leave us!
Marcus.
I see you've been busy.
It took you long enough.
Persia, Gaul, Egypt...
I go wherever my empire needs me.
Your empire dies today.
No.
It will never die in here.
Rome is more,
more than princesses and palaces.
It is a thought, an ideal,
a vision of beauty, order, and peace.
Someday...
My destiny is to create it again,
in all its perfection.
Not if you're dead.
It is you, my friend, who are dead.
Here.
Just open your eyes.
That wasn't very nice.
Barbarian.
This is your destiny.
There can be only one!
Damn!
Stupid boy. As I told you,
you had no chance.
Stubborn and vain, you wouldn't listen.
All you knew was your hateful Marcus,
all you had was your quest for revenge.
Wasting centuries of life on a useless
journey that could only end in your death.
Marcus!
No! Colin!
A warrior came to us without a clan,
without a name.
He fought for us, he died for us.
He lived a stranger, but in death,
he's a Highlander.
From today onward, he shall be known
as our brother
Colin MacLeod, of Clan Macleod.
When you did find a place to
call your home...
...and a woman who loved you,
what did you do?
I see him!
This way!
Get out of the way, Deborah!
The demon must be destroyed!
You'll have to kill me first!
Are you mad, girl!
Get out of the way, Deborah!
Leave me, Deborah.
This is my fight.
No, it's mine. I love you!
No!
Kill him now!
Leave him be! Leave him, no!
Colin!
Enough!
You'll not do this man any harm!
But Gregor! He's a demon!
We saw him dead, yet now he lives!
He's the devil!
I know not what magic
returned him to life...
But he fought at our side and
helped bring us a great victory.
Look at his eyes!
There is no evil there, only sadness.
And you will not,
raise your hand against him!
He has bewitched you!
He must die!
Then I swear on my honor...
...then so will you!
Go.
But never forget...
...that you are Colin MacLeod,
of Clan MacLeod.
Live with honor, Highlander.
Colin!
Did Deborah's love or Gregor's faith
change you?
Did you live with honor?
No, because honor
was not what you wanted.
For over a thousand years,
there was only vengeance.
Marcus!
Don't you ever get tired of this, boy?
Never!
The game ends now.
Marcus!
Hey, look on the bright side!
You've got an exquisite samurai sword.
You died again and again
with no thought...
...to what you could've been,
and what you could've done.
Well that'll at least
get you an A for effort.
Nice sword.
It's a pity you won't live
long enough to use it.
After all,
it was meant for a samurai...
...not a barbarian, like you.
Holy ground.
This must be your lucky day.
Why don't you just give up
before your luck runs out?
Anywhere you go... I will follow!
Relentless bastard, aren't you?
Aren't you tired of losing yet?
Tell me. Have you done anything
in the last 2,000 years...
...besides try
unsuccessfully to kill me?
I can write poetry in
three dozen languages.
I paint like Rembrandt,
and play piano like Liszt.
...and you?
I loved Moya...
...and you killed her!
I loved Rome. Things die.
It is the way of life.
All we can do is try to find a
reason to go on, to build it again.
I have found mine.
Why don't you find something?
Mine... is to bury you.
I wonder... who is the bigger fool?
So here we go again.
You must really enjoy
getting your arse kicked.
You do it so often.
Shit!
Assholes!
Dahlia, hurry!
Close...!
I knew it was you.
He's my guest.
You're looking well, old friend.
The same pitiful savage
you have always been.
I see you never get tired of failing.
You've come to be put out of your misery.
You've come to die.
Congratulations.
Today, your sick vendetta ends.
I'm having fun... are you having fun?
That'll hurt.
Oh, shit!
Colin!
Keep going.
C'mon, let's go! He's dead!
Get the vaccine to Doc.
And tell him about the virus!
What are you waiting for!
I'm outta here!
Colin!
What...!
Jesus! You were dead...
...weren't you?
Yeah. I was.
But it's not the first time.
You expect me to believe...
...that you ran out on us because...
...you and Marcus are both
...immortal?
And you've been chasing him
all this time...
...for revenge... all this time...
...because he killed your wife,
2,000 years ago?
2,000 years?
I think you're outta your fuckin' mind.
I'm getting tired of this crap!
Not feelin' so good.
I can't...
...go... much...
2,000 fuckin' years!
So much grief. So much hate.
You've had so much pain.
You must have really loved her.
That was very impressive...
...not.
At least you're consistent.
Where am I?
Inside.
Inside your own head.
Pretty empty here.
Remember this place?
Or have you forgotten her,
like you forgot your promise?
So... what would Moya think of you now?
Moya's gone.
Who, you think?
This is her grave.
I've met trees with more brains.
You think she was only of the body?
That dust is all she has become?
Moya's soul, her essence, is eternal.
She was meant to meet you again.
And it has found you throughout time.
But you stagger around, blind and stupid.
Unable to see, unable to love...
...so full of anger and rage.
You have lost your reason, your promise.
You're full of shit.
Am I?
Open your eyes.
Don't you see?
Don't you get it?
Moya, Deborah, Dahlia...
...are the same woman.
Colin!
Moya!
It's me.
Dahlia saved your butt!
Welcome back.
About five minutes ago, you had six
broken ribs, three crushed vertebrae...
...and you were bleeding out from
a ruptured spleen.
Now you're not.
It's him!
He's really alive!
I'm used to people running from me,
like I was the devil.
What you are doesn't matter.
You not only helped bring them vaccine...
...you brought them something
much more important.
You brought them hope.
They now believe
that anything is possible.
And so do I.
Doc! Tell me you're not thinking of
going to war with the city.
I'm tired of hiding in sewers,
waiting for the day they kill us all.
Are you out of your mind?
He has an army.
You have no chance.
You have no chance.
We have a choice.
Doc!
Listen up everyone!
Today we have learned the truth!
This virus has one purpose. To kill us all!
I say we fight! Who fights with me?
We got no choice!
Let's take back our city!
Tell all your friends!
Tomorrow, we take back our city.
Tomorrow, we take back our lives.
Colin. You'll fight with us, right?
It's our war. It's not his problem.
But...!
To glory!
Glory!
In the name of honor!
Death to Rome!
It was all going so well.
Now you say it's useless?
What am I to do with you?
Not useless... just not perfect.
Until we can control it, to use it
is madness. It could kill us all.
I just need... a little time.
Which... sadly, you do not have.
You're done.
What do you mean, done?
Done means... done.
They won't like that
we've created the virus.
I think it's time
for a little creative brutality.
Go.
Yes, sir!
What about... Macleod?
Don't bother looking for him.
He'll be back.
Come in.
I never thanked you
for carrying me out of there.
Forget it.
If you die, you won't be coming back.
Sometimes dying is easier than living.
Seems like my whole life
I've been fighting.
If I die, and we win,
that's good enough for me.
Every day at church... I pray for it.
I know you don't believe...
...but I'm sure god's been listening.
He has to be.
...because he answered one of my prayers.
Colin.
I was praying...
...for you.
Hey, where's Dahlia?
We're letting her sleep.
But she'll miss the fight!
So much for the element of surprise.
C'mon, tough shit on us!
It's now or never.
Rudy's right.
But there's only one way
you can really win.
Marcus has to die.
Can you hold out long enough?
What are your chances of killing him?
Best you not know.
You're right... Same here.
Colin, there's another way into the city,
but you'd have to be crazy to try it.
Show me.
Thought you'd say that.
We fire, then we move. Got it?
Got it.
C'mon, baby. Come to papa.
Wait'll you see what daddy's got for you.
A little more... that's it.
Up there!
Keep firing!
Blow those assholes apart!
Run!
Colin!
Mother... fucker!
This is it.
Right through there...
Let's fall back!
I told you, you had to be crazy...
...but this is the only
way to get up there.
Thanks. I'll take it from here.
Hey Colin. Kick his ass.
You can't hide from me, cutie!
Not bad... for a pretty boy!
I don't know whether to kill you...
...or to do you.
Poor baby. That must hurt!
You giving up?
Dahlia!
I'll deal with you later, asshole!
Just do what you gotta do,
and get your ass back to me!
Dahlia! Be careful!
I love you, Colin.
Nail it this time!
I give you... two to one against.
Twenty bucks?
You're on!
What a bang!
Who's the man?
You're the man.
Let's finish this.
You got it.
C'mon, it's time to kick some ass!
There's the signal!
Let's do it!
Fire!
The more things change...
... the more they stay the same.
Right?
Just like now.
You were there.
Are you responsible for this?
No. You are.
Their battle. My battle.
It will only end...
...with your death!
Barbarians will always be barbarians.
If I can't control them,
or tame them...
...I might as well start all over again.
What are you doing?
Isn't it obvious? I'm going to
kill everything in New York.
You're insane!
In two minutes, the virus flies.
Can you stop it?
Now, time is a waistin'.
As I said... everything dies.
But no sacrifice is too great,
in the quest for perfection.
The difference between you and I
is that I will rebuild my empire.
I will have my dream...
...unlike you, who has wasted an
eternity on nothing.
And so... my new world...
Begins!
Oh no...
Virus!
How does that feel?
Oh, don't worry your pretty head
about it. You won't be alone.
Everyone dies today...
...except for Marcus and me.
No...
...I think... I'll take...
...you with me!
Colin! I will see you again.
...one day...
Dahlia!
...in another time...
God...
...help me...
...for them...
...for her.
Back so soon?
Why don't you stay down?
You're pathetic, and weak.
This time, I take your head!
There can be... only one!
So, big shot. You've finally won.
Too late. For everything.
No, it wasn't.
You saved the city.
The quickening wiped out the virus.
I do pity that poor girl
