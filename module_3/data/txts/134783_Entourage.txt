I may have to jerk it
before we even get there.
Not near me, please.
Let me see.
Who throws a party
when his wife leaves him
on their honeymoon?
Vince does.
And why wouldn't he?
I hope that's what
my next honeymoon's like.
Vince.
Yo. Come in.
Hey.
Your friends are here.
Really? Ah, I didn't
think they'd come.
What?
Let them wait.
I just got out
of a failed marriage.
You're gonna have to give me
at least a few hours.
Okay. A few.
Hey, boys!
Hey, baby bro!
Welcome.
What's up?
I told you guys
you didn't have to come.
Yeah, we were in Paris
anyway.
We wanted to make sure
there wasn't
a Natalie wood-type situation
you needed coverin' up.
Aw, I appreciate it.
Thanks.
E did kinda hesitate
when we asked him
if he would help
with that sort of thing.
Jerk-off. We thought you were alone!
I was.
Where'd you find
all the hotties?
It's Ibiza, Turtle.
They found me.
Come on.
I like Ibiza, bro.
We'll be right back.
Right back.
Nobody leaves.
Except you.
You can go.
So, what happened?
Just wasn't workin'.
After 9 days?
Sometimes you just know.
We all knew
when you were sayin' "I do."
I know, I know.
I made a mistake.
But it's not like it was the
shortest marriage in Hollywood history.
No. Britney Spears.
2 days. I looked it up.
Thank you,
Turtle.
All right.
So, what now?
Easy. We're gonna
get it annulled.
Trust me,
it's all good.
And she agrees?
She said it first.
I mean, we're lying there
looking at each other,
and we didn't
have a thing to say.
Who does?
And I'm thinkin',
"what did I do?"
And then she said it.
And then she just left?
No, we had sex first,
agreed to be friends,
and then went to sleep, and
when I woke up, she was gone.
She left this note.
What's it say?
You're not
gonna believe it.
"I read the script
for your next movie.
You're better than this."
They're doing
another rewrite.
Yeah, well, I read it again.
She's right.
It sucks.
Let's get out of it.
The movie starts shooting next month.
I know.
But I realized this whole
rushing into marriage thing
is because
I'm searching for something.
Something meaningful.
I really need to do
something different.
Different than anything
I've ever done before.
Yeah,
me, too, bro.
Ari says
he's got somethin'.
Ari's retired.
Isn't he?
Fax? Fax. Fax.
I'm sorry. I can't print, scan or
E-mail 'cause there's no Internet-o.
I need
to get back to civilization.
Honey, can you
take any longer to pack?
Ari, do not push me,
or I'll change my mind again.
I wouldn't push her,
Dad.
Vinnie Chase.
Ari Gold!
Vegas odds had your retirement
lasting longer than my marriage.
Well, good thing
that I bet big against both.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.
And you?
How'd you get the wife
to let you go back to work?
Once she realized that
she couldn't understand what
the real housewives of Milan
were saying, she begged to go.
Ari. I'm not going
back to work, Vinnie.
I am going back to be
the king of Hollywood,
but I agreed to live
by all of my queen's rules.
One of which is to leave
my nutsac in the mediterranean.
Mm-hmm.
I heard that.
But we're all good.
Good.
I hear
you got something for me.
Something big.
My first movie as studio head,
and boom!
I want you to star in it.
Oh, yeah?
How badly?
What do you mean?
'Cause I decided
whatever I do next,
I also want to direct.
Does he even know
how to direct?
Ari?
Ari.
Ari.
Even if you've never seen
a Vincent Chase movie,
chances are
you've heard the name.
The 34-year-old has
15 starring roles on his resume,
including
James Cameron's "Aquaman,"
once the all-time
Box-Office champ.
Chase Hails from modest roots
in Queens, New York,
where he was raised
by a single mother,
and surrounded
by a group of loyal friends.
<i>Friends
who still surround him today.</i>
<i>We caught up with Chase
and his entourage</i>
<i>on the set of
his directorial debut, "Hyde."</i>
Who's he callin' an entourage?
<i>A modern-day retelling of...</i>
Not me. I'm a relative.
<i>Robert Louis Stevenson's
classic, "Jekyll and Hyde,"</i>
<i>a film
that some in the industry</i>
<i>are now whispering
was too expensive</i>
<i>to be put
in the hands of a first-timer.</i>
Eh.
Shut up.
<i>Is that
what people are saying?</i>
<i>Well, this is
a very big undertaking.</i>
Well, it's not that big.
Though the sets are big.
The sets are big.
Enormous, in fact.
No expense
seems to have been spared
in turning
the streets of Hollywood
into a futuristic
Los Angeles nightmare.
We wanted to surround Vince
with the best people
in the business
to make sure
he was covered.
<i>That's "Hyde" producer
Eric Murphy,</i>
<i>Chase's longtime manager</i>
<i>and best friend
since kindergarten.</i>
<i>But what exactly
were his qualifications</i>
<i>when Mr. Chase
asked him to come on board?</i>
I was actually
managing a Sbarro's.
Sbarro's?
Yeah.
The pizza place.
This pizza place, in fact.
Nice pic.
<i>Chase plucked Murphy away</i>
<i>from a life of spinning pies...</i>
I am gonna kill my mother.
<i>...and decided he was equipped
to help guide him through</i>
<i>the treacherous waters
of Hollywood.</i>
What did everybody else think?
Well, my agent at the time,
he wasn't too happy.
<i>His agent at the time</i>
<i>was none other than
Hollywood powerhouse Ari Gold,</i>
<i>who has since moved on
from the agency business,</i>
<i>and is now
the head of the studio</i>
<i>that is producing "Hyde."</i>
You see it
with pro athletes.
You... you see it
with movie stars.
They want to share the ride
with their friends.
It makes it feel
more real for them.
And were you okay
with this?
No, I was not okay with it.
I hated it.
I mean, I found this kid
off a mentos commercial.
Really?
Yeah.
I was watching TV
with the wife
and I said,
"This guy's a star."
Mentos. The Freshmaker.
And you were right.
I'm that good, Piers.
<i>- It wasn't just Murphy that Gold
- was forced to deal with.</i>
<i>There was
sal "Turtle" assante,</i>
<i>another friend
from the neighborhood,</i>
<i>who became Vince's driver.</i>
I like to think
I did more than just drive.
Yeah, he drove,
he parked, he waited.
Yes! He also made a fortune
in a Tequila company
that's a good line.
<i>When Chase helped him...</i>
<i>Gain access
to billionaire Mark Cuban.</i>
<i>How much did he make?</i>
He won't say.
It's so annoying.
<i>And that's Chase's
half-brother...</i>
Why's he
got to say that?
I know.
He should've said quarter.
<i>...and actor, Johnny Chase.</i>
Victory!
<i>You've probably seen him
in something</i>
<i>because, well, he's been in
just about everything.</i>
<i>"Melrose place,"
"pacific blue," "law & order,"</i>
<i>and the recently canceled
animated show "Johnny Bananas."</i>
I can't believe you did this,
Ronald. I'm so screwed.
<i>And today, he feels he may have
caught the break of a lifetime</i>
<i>as his younger brother cast him
in what he describes</i>
<i>as a small but pivotal role
in "Hyde."</i>
So, you came
to Hollywood first?
I was the trailblazer.
And then Vince followed?
With Turtle.
They lived in my house rent-free
for the first year.
But,
as I understand it,
you now live in Vince's house?
I'm 40 years old
and could quite possibly
get an Oscar nom this year.
Why the would I live
at my baby brother's house?
I can't believe you just
cursed at Piers Morgan.
I can't believe he just said
he might get an Oscar nom.
I'm just staying there
till my roof gets reshingled.
So I got the pizza boy,
the brother Fredo, and a Turtle.
Yet, somehow, this sort of
weird collection of people,
it worked.
It did, and the truth is,
their blind loyalty to
each other is kind of charming.
Some people, Ari, say you have
the same character traits.
I like to think of myself
as loyal, but not blind.
Yet, many were surprised when
you let Vince direct this movie.
Many people were surprised
when someone let Mel Gibson
direct "Braveheart"
or Kevin Costner direct
"Dances with Wolves."
They both won Oscars.
But they weren't studio heads
handing ex-clients
directorial debuts at a time
when the studio suffered
it's worst ever fiscal year,
and without
any tentpole franchise
to bolster
the hemorrhaging losses.
Listen,
the year ain't over,
and this is
a franchise picture.
Right, but you are
way over budget.
Where'd you hear that?
Ari, your neck
is on the line here,
and so is Vincent Chase's...
You've got to be worried.
I don't worry.
I just win.
I thought this was gonna be
a fluff piece, piers.
No.
No. Okay, great.
Well, why don't... why don't
we turn those cameras off.
Is it hot in here?
No, I'm good.
I got Ang Lee
from the set.
<i>Nin hao, ni zing.</i>
<i>Hey...</i>
You okay?
I don't usually worry, either.
What are you worried about?
The movie's gonna be great.
No, I'm not worried
about that right now.
I'm worried
about telling Ari
that we need more money
to finish the movie.
Well, isn't it the producer's
job to tell Ari that?
Seriously, E.
I will call him tomorrow.
You said that yesterday.
I'll call him.
Fine.
So,
should we go out tonight?
Definitely.
Oh, yeah.
I'm having
a great hair day.
Nah, I can't.
I have plans.
With who?
You don't know her.
Does your soon-to-be
baby mama know her? Yeah.
Drama, Sloan and I haven't been
together for like 6 months.
Yeah, but you haven't
been with anyone else either.
Oh, please,
like you'd know.
Come on.
Who's the girl?
Her name's Melanie,
all right?
I've been seeing her
a few weeks.
A few weeks?
Jesus Christ.
This guy snuck into
another relationship.
It's not a relationship.
I'm just having fun.
Fun is when you forget
a girl's name
while you're fuckin' her.
No wonder why
he has no time for business.
Jesus. Guys, you know,
we're almost 35. He's almost 60.
I don't have to
answer to this shit.
Fine. Don't.
Yeah,
she must be a pig.
Definitely.
You're amazing.
Well,
you're doing all the work.
You're doing plenty.
Oh, my God.
This could be it.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
I got to take this.
Hello?
Please tell me
you're not still sleeping.
I've already
run 5 miles
and fucked
like an adult-film star.
I'm about to have a baby,
asshole.
I thought you were Sloan.
Speaking of which,
you were in my dream last night.
Yeah, well,
I hope I wasn't naked.
Nope, your baby mama gave birth
to Pete Dinklage.
You're not related to him, are you?
Who is that?
You got a girl there, E?
What do you want, Ari?
Big titties?
Tight ass?
Give me something
I can use in the office.
I can hear you.
You're disgusting.
And I have both.
How do you do it, E?
I know it's not
your looks or your personality.
Ari.
Just one pic.
Come on. My wife didn't really
fuck me this morning.
She gets headaches.
Ari!
Hey, Thierry.
Hey.
You gonna coach
my son's team?
I don't have time
for that shit.
I love the honesty.
E, when am I
gonna see this movie?
You know, I was gonna call you
today to talk about that.
I don't want to talk.
I want to watch a film.
Well, it's not ready.
When will it be ready?
'Cause important people
are starting to wonder.
Important people meaning me.
Did I tell you
<i>the Jewish journal</i>
just named me "best-looking
circumcised studio head"?
Yeah, well, Vince still
hasn't finished his cut.
You've been saying that
for a month.
Hold on a second.
Do you have time
for lunch today?
No, I-I can't.
I got the... I got the doctor.
Oh, that's right.
With Sloan.
Look,
I know this is weird...
Eric!
Yeah, uh, listen...
How about if, uh, Vince and I
come in and see you today?
See me? Why?
Something wrong?
No, it's all good.
We're just gonna come by the
office this morning. You free?
For what?
What's wrong?
Uh, we need more money.
Bye.
Don't hang...
Did you hang up on me?!
E, you fuckin' dwarf cunt!
What's a dwarf cunt,
dad?
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's nothing, buddy.
It's a new movie idea
I had.
Don't use that word
at school.
You were just on a run.
How could you be so angry?
Work is not supposed to make you
this angry anymore, Ari.
Yeah, dad.
I know. I know.
That was our agreement.
Yes. I know.
Do we need to make a therapy
session with Dr. Marcus?
No.
I think
that would be best.
Maybe.
Come on. Why are you
so scared to show Ari the movie?
I'm not scared.
You should at least
show him my scenes.
It's just not ready yet,
which is why
I need E to tell him
that he can't see it
till after the screening.
You really won't tell him?
I told him
about the money.
The only thing he's gonna do
is scream at me.
Oh, fine.
I'll tell him.
Pussy.
Uh,
speaking of which,
wait till you see the girls
I got lined up for tonight.
I told you
I was handlin' the girls.
I know, but I would
like to avoid
some of the nursing-home rejects
from the last party.
I thought the screening
was to get opinions
on the movie,
not to get laid.
Everything we do
is to also get laid, E.
You know that.
Fuck me.
Emily Ratajkowski.
I love her.
I know her.
Why wouldn't you?
Hey, Vince.
Hey, Emily.
How are you?
It's so funny to see you.
I just got an invitation
for your screening.
Really?
Yeah.
One of mine,
obviously.
Whosever. This is gonna be
a great fucking screening.
Mm-hmm.
Vince.
Uh, hey, uh, Emily,
I-I got to run
into this meeting.
I-I'll call you later?
Yeah. Call me.
You're upset.
"Upset"?
He means angry.
This is the third time
that you've come to me
for more money.
Ari, listen...
I was talking to Vince, Eric!
See, I know they didn't
teach you about budgets
in spaghetti-and-meatballs
class.
Vinnie has been on sets
before,
so I expected more
from him.
I told you
he was gonna yell at me.
Yeah,
but he's yelling about me.
What'd you
spend the money on, anyway?
I mean, I know it wasn't
on Turtle and Craft services.
You like the new
svelte frame, huh?
You look like
Karen fuckin' carpenter.
What did I tell you
when I gave you
$100 million?
What'd we tell you?
You agreed
to not go over.
We told you
it wasn't enough.
But you agreed
to not go over.
Because you said I couldn't
direct unless we agreed.
It's like when a girl asks if
you want to bang her hot sister.
Of course you say no.
Neither of you really believes
you mean it, though.
What is he doing here?
This is bad.
When you see the movie,
you won't think so.
He's seen it?
He's seen
a couple of scenes.
They are powerful.
Yeah,
a few in particular.
When am I gonna see it?
Well, we're gonna have
a friends-and-family
screening tonight.
We're gonna get some feedback,
and then we'll show you the cut.
You're gonna let everyone
see the fuckin' movie but me.
Ari,
you are all that matters.
I want it to be perfect
when I show it to you.
I can't just
write you a check.
I got to deal with
these co-financiers in Texas.
Do you know how hard I have
worked to avoid going to Texas?
Do you know what they do
to Jews in Texas?
Look, Ari, I didn't
take an acting fee on this,
which you know is more than
the $10 million over budget we are.
You're 15 over.
Really?
Okay, well, I didn't take the
fee because I wanted to direct.
Now, we've known each other for 15 years,
so you got to trust me.
I didn't waste
one single nickel.
I've been killing myself
to make this movie great,
and I'm not gonna stop working
until it is perfect.
I need the money
to make it perfect.
So...
Can you get it for me?
Hey.
Hey.
Sorry I'm late.
No, you're not late.
You're on time,
as always.
How you feelin'?
Big.
Well, you look great.
Thanks.
Did you get my E-mail
about my cousin Sean?
He had his baby.
No, what did he have?
A girl. Laurie.
Oh.
I sent you a picture.
I think your E-mails
are going to my spam.
It's not intentional.
Look.
There she is.
Oh, my God.
She's beautiful!
Look at those eyes.
Someone named Melanie
wants your cock.
Huh?
Mm.
Yeah, it just came up
on the screen.
"I want your cock."
From Melanie.
Wow, that's, uh...
Classy.
Sorry.
It's not my business.
Sloan?
Oh. Coming.
Okay,
let me help you up.
I will, uh, be right here
when you get out.
Okay.
And I'll be in there.
Okay.
This is some bullshit.
Hey, Tip.
How you doin', man?
Man, I'm doing just fine if I'm gonna
have more kids than albums.
I'm doin' just damn fine.
You need
to shut the fuck up.
Don't tell me to shut the fuck
up. You shut your ovaries up.
Oh,
so it's my fault.
I'm gonna take this.
I'll be right back.
Yeah, man. Call somebody
who can kick me in my nuts.
I need a vasectomy.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Bad time?
No, but you can't text me
shit like that.
Shit like what?
You beg me to text you
sexy stuff all day.
I know, but Sloan
was lookin' at my phone.
Oh. I didn't realize you were
at the doctor's already.
And why's she looking at your phone?
Ah, you know.
I was showin' her a picture
of my cousin's baby. Great.
Yeah, she must
really think I'm a whore.
No, she doesn't.
God, I only sent that
because I was feeling insecure.
I didn't think she
or anyone else was gonna see it.
I know, I'm sorry.
This is really weird, Eric.
You were right.
This is too weird.
Could we talk about this
at the screening tonight?
No, Eric. I-I really
don't want to get in any deeper.
I think
you're a great guy.
I really do.
And I promise
I'm not mad.
Just respect me,
please.
Don't call.
Look, all we're saying is
we don't get
why you have to fall in love
with every girl you fuck.
And all I'm saying is that,
unlike you,
I like to have
more of a connection
than whether or not
I have exact change.
Pfft. Please. I haven't paid
for pussy in years.
At least a year.
The point is the girl
said not to call her anymore.
So respect that
and see if she calls you.
Yeah,
but hope she doesn't.
You got enough complications
right now.
Right.
How's Sloan, anyway?
Doctor says
she's gonna pop any second.
One vagina closes
just as another opens.
You're disgusting.
Yeah, and you're a mope, E,
which we can't have.
Seriously, this is
a big night for Vince,
so try not to ruin it.
Don't worry. His moping
has never affected me.
I'm not moping.
No, you're moping, E.
And you need to get on top
of somethin' fast so you stop.
I had sex less than 6 hours
ago, Drama.
I think I'll be okay.
You're fuckin' somethin'
tonight.
For baby bro,
if not for yourself.
Holy shit!
What?
Ronda Rousey,
the fighter.
So what? So I love her!
Get in the car!
Get in the car!
Jesus, Turtle!
Sorry!
Do you even know her?
Yes. We met at Coachella
a few years ago, remember?
Oh, yeah.
Think we had a connection.
Please. He's got a better chance
of fuckin' me. Or me.
Should I abandon this?
Do you really think
you had a connection?
Yeah.
Then go.
You're good peoples, Vin.
Yo, stop following me,
motherfucker!
No! No! We know each other!
Geez.
I just wanted to invite you
to my boy's screening.
Oh. Hey, Vince.
Hi.
Uh, sorry about your car.
It's all good.
Do you remember me?
Oh, yeah, but didn't you
used to be really fat?
Lloyd, how many times have
I told you I don't video chat with men?
You know how comforting your
face is to me, Ari. What do you need?
Well, I was wondering if I would
be seeing you at Vince's screening.
You were invited?
Drama wants me
to see his scenes.
You weren't?
I'm in Texas.
Smell the cow shit?
Oh.
That's too bad.
I actually wanted
to see you face to face.
We are face to face, Yoko.
In 3 dimensions.
Why?
Eh...
No. It's nothing.
Could we have lunch
this week?
I don't typically have lunch
with my ex-assistants, Lloyd.
Not unless I need something
from them,
which I can't ever imagine
being the case with you,
so what's up?
I'm getting married!
Oh, God.
And I want you to give me away.
Oh, God!
Please,
don't make a Gay joke.
I wasn't going to. I was
gonna make a marriage joke.
Now that you've
been granted those rights,
good luck
with the divorce.
That'll really make you wish
for a good old ass fucking.
Ari.
I got to go.
Wait! Ari!
Will you give me away?
Bye.
Hey, Larsen.
Say, Ari.
This is my son,
Travis.
He's gonna sit in with us,
if you don't mind.
Good.
Ari, we sure do appreciate you
Comin' out here all this way.
Oh, of course.
You've been on the job
nearly 8 months,
and you hadn't
paid us a visit yet.
We're beginnin' to feel unloved.
Well,
I didn't know I was invited.
Oh, anybody who spends my money
like you do,
always invited to my home
to tell me why.
Saw you on "Piers Morgan" last night.
Oh, yeah?
What'd you think?
I thought
you looked nervous.
Well, I wasn't.
Travis, here, he's got a real
good eye for things like that,
and h-he said you looked like
one of them guys that, uh...
W-what was it
you said again, Travis?
U-uh, like... like one of
those guys from big Tobacco
when they were up there
lyin' to congress.
Ah.
Well...
Well, my wife
thought I looked sexy.
Ari, am I gonna lose a shit ton
of money on this movie?
No. Your money's
in great hands.
But you still
want more of it.
Just a little bit for some
visual effects that it needs.
I don't care
about visual effects.
Well, if you want
to protect your investment,
you need to care.
Hm.
You know,
in the last 4 years,
I've invested
nearly a billion dollars
in your studio's movies.
You know how many I've seen?
Mnh-mnh.
Not a Goddamn one.
Hm.
But this one here,
I got to tell you,
with your... your movie-star guy
in charge and everything,
I-I'm damn curious.
I understand.
Ari, we're gonna need
to see this thing
before I write
another check.
Larsen, my director...
Your...
Your movie star?
Vince doesn't want to show
the movie till it's perfect.
He's an artist.
I'd like to respect that.
Okay.
You know, my wife has
a $12,000 Chihuahua.
3 years runnin',
it got "Best in show."
The last judge
said that he had
the best cock and balls
he'd ever seen.
But he ain't perfect.
You know
how I know that?
He keeps pissin'
on my boots.
I-I don't follow.
I mean there's
no such thing as perfect.
Now, see, for you,
I know this movie's enormous.
If it fails,
you go down in flames
quicker than the Hindenberg.
To me,
this is just another check.
It won't fail.
I have to go to Dubai tonight
on, uh, more pressin' business.
I want you to take Travis here
to la-la land with you
and show him
the Goddamn movie.
It's not ready.
Well, get it ready.
'Cause this oil spigot
is shut off till you do.
Are you seriously asking me
if I'm taking P.E.D.S?
Yeah, and I'm not saying
I'm against it.
I just want to know
if you do,
because I want to get shredded
for the "Hyde" junket.
No P.E.D.S. I'm all natural.
Prove it.
How?
Take a piss test.
Fine, but if I pass,
you drink it.
Guys, did you know
Emily was seeing Armie Hammer?
The Lone Ranger?
I thought they broke up.
I guess they still talk.
I played softball
with the guy.
He's out of his mind.
I'd leave it alone, bro.
Really?
Yeah.
I'm gonna try to.
Why does it look like
there's enough food here
for 300?
I don't know, 'cause there's
supposed to be enough for 500.
500?!
Well, and Ronda.
Look, Vince,
this was supposed to be
an intimate thing
so we could get some feedback.
Relax. Turtle thought we'd do
better with a big crowd.
Don't worry, I got everyone
walkin' through that door
signing an NDA,
so they can't talk about it.
And where are you gonna sit
500 people? On the couch?
Don't be ridiculous.
There's a whole beach
out there.
Check it out.
Jesus.
It's Ari.
Hello?
When exactly
is this screening of yours?
When it gets dark.
Why?
'Cause I'm coming
with your money,
and there ain't nothing
we can do about it.
I don't ride a bike.
I do the Santa Monica steps.
Sick, bro.
Sick.
The story of Jekyll and Hyde
represents
a concept in victorian culture
of the inner conflict
of humanity's sense
of good and evil.
I have no understanding
of what you're saying, bro.
Of course
I remember you guys.
You went to middle school
with my daughter.
We always thought
you were so funny.
And so cute.
Let's go.
You tired yet, Turtle?
Hey, Vince. Buddy.
I need a favor. Yeah.
I need you to fuck my daughter's
friends so I don't have to.
In English literature,
there's a guy named Jekyll
and a guy named Hyde.
And you have
that same thing in you.
Do you understand?
I'm gonna show you
some of my footage.
You're gonna flip out.
You might want to
put me in "Iron Man 3."
Sure. Well, we did thr...
4 would be next. "Iron Man 4."
Downey's great. Don't
get me wrong. I love Downey.
He's just a little
long in the tooth.
Right. I think you want
to go younger, man.
If I recall, you're 5 years
older than him.
You know, fuck you, Favreau.
What...
Nah. You fucked me
on "Swingers."
You fucked m...
You're always fucking me.
I offered you "Swingers."
You couldn't do it
because of "Viking Quest."
You coulda shot around me!
Just because you're short
doesn't mean you can't
achieve your goals, E.
No, I-I know that.
Do you think
I'd have a super bowl ring
if I listened to everybody
who told me I was too short?
Right.
We're thinking of honeymooning
in Moscow or the Ukraine.
We know
it's not traditional.
Traditional?
Fuck traditional.
Don't they shoot guys like you
over there?
That's Uganda.
Go to Hawaii.
Do yourself a fuckin' favor.
Molly.
Anyone want Molly?
Molly. Molly.
Anyone want Molly?
I thought you
don't do drugs anymore, Billy.
I don't do angry drugs
anymore, Drama.
Give me two.
I'm sure Ari has seen
an unfinished film before.
Not one I've directed.
You're really nervous, huh?
It's cute.
What, you never get nervous
before a photo shoot?
No, I know
what I look like.
Everyone make sure you fill out
a non-disclosure agreement
or you cannot stay
for the screening.
Oh, E, this house is sick.
When did Vince buy it?
It's not Vince's.
It's Turtle's.
You're kidding. How much
does this fucking guy make?
Excuse me, miss. You can't use a
pencil when you're filling out the NDA.
So, that's a true story?
You beat up 4 guys for
gettin' loud at a movie theater?
Well,
the press exaggerated.
I just broke one guy's jaw
and another guy's nose.
And the third guy...
There wasn't really 4.
The third guy, I just threw over
my shoulder, and he ran off.
A boyfriend with you
or anything? And what'd he do?
No, I haven't had a boyfriend
in like 2 years.
Too focused on my career.
Oh.
You're in
4 fucking scenes,
and you expect me
to get you a magazine cover?
Scarlett Jo wasn't even
on camera in "Her."
She got a cover.
Yeah, well, if you had her tits,
I can get you a cover.
I got a couple covers
Comin' out, Drama.
Even a few I turned down.
What the fuck
you makin' over here?
Little potion for E.
Molly, water,
and a touch of Viagra.
What did I do wrong
with my life?
This is a normal
Tuesday afternoon?
You got to see
our Wednesday parties.
Ari!
You got invited.
I want you to meet my fiance, Greg.
No, Lloyd! No!
Eric Murphy.
Travis Mccredle.
Nice to meet you, Travis.
Hi.
Eric manages Vinnie.
Oh.
And Travis's father
co-finances our entire slate.
All that money's
gonna be mine someday,
so I prefer you consider
that I co-financed the slate.
Fuck me.
Is that Emily Ratajkowski over
there talkin' to Vinnie Chase?
Sure is.
You want to meet her?
Well,
I want to marry her,
but you got to
start somewhere, right?
Oh, boy.
E, have some water.
Why?
You look parched.
Almost sickly.
Are you serious?
You're yellow, bro.
Vinnie Chase!
Big fan of your work,
especially "Aquaman 2."
Ah, thanks. But I was
only in the first "Aquaman."
Well, all those
comic-book movies
start to blend together
after a while.
Except for "The Avengers."
All 5 of those heroes
on screen at one time.
That was really something,
wasn't it?
Yeah, well...
Travis, have you met
Emily Ratajkowski?
No, but I feel like
we already know each other.
I saw your sports illustrated
spread on the plane.
That looked cold.
Was that cold?
It was.
Well, it was still hot.
Travis, Vinnie
would like to thank you
for all the support that
you've given him on his movie.
Yes.
$100 million-plus
with P&A.
And I hear
you're lookin' for more.
Just a little.
Well, I'm lookin' forward
to being able to explain why.
I'm gonna go get a drink.
Let you guys talk?
Okay.
Vince,
I-Is... is that your girl?
Oh, no.
We're just friends.
Oh. So I'm free in the clear
to go for that?
Uh, yeah.
I don't know
what I'm askin' you for.
You don't own every piece
of pussy in this town, do you?
Mr. Suit.
Are you okay?
I feel strange.
Strange how?
My dick gets hard
every time a girl looks at me.
Like, today or always?
You're cute.
I should probably
go talk to her.
Seems like
the right move, Suit.
You're a good guy,
Bill.
Maybe I could finance
somethin' for you to star in.
Have you seen
anything I've done, or...?
Uh, not in complete,
but I've seen that trailer
for that new one you got
Comin' out maybe 500 times.
Maybe you want to finance
something for me to star in.
I'm Johnny,
Vince's brother.
Oh. Hey.
You're an actor, too?
Yeah.
What've you been in?
Everything.
Have you seen him
in anything?
Um, I, uh...
I've seen him
in "Viking Quest."
Really?
Yeah, and he's in my movie.
Oh.
Just 4 scenes.
4 pivotal scenes.
He's amazing.
Really?
Yeah.
One of the reasons why
I wanted to make this movie
is because I knew what that role
would do for my big bro.
It's gonna change his life.
Thanks, bro.
Well, I can't wait
to see it.
I can't either.
So, what's up?
Are we gonna do this?
Ari, relax. It's not gonna be
dark for at least an hour.
By the time everyone's seated,
it'll be dark.
Let's go.
All right.
I got to find E.
Fuck E.
To get back
to my conversation...
So, you're a "Viking Quest" fan,
huh?
How long
have you lived here?
Just a couple of months.
It came with
all the furniture and stuff,
so it feels lived-in.
So, what's your deal,
Turtle?
You selling coke
these days?
No.
Why...
Why would you say that?
I say that
'cause the last time I saw you,
you were a fat pothead
living off of Vince.
And now you live
next to Spielberg.
I started a Tequila company.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
And I started workin' out.
What do you do,
pilates?
I box a little.
And I... I do cardio.
That's cute.
What?
I think
someone's fuckin' in there.
Come on.
Motherfucker!
Oh, my God!
I got it.
Fucker.
Hey!
Oh!
Oh, shit!
Of all the guys I never thought
I'd catch fuckin' in my room.
Sorry.
No, don't be.
I love it. I love it.
Hi, Ronda Rousey.
I won 500 bucks
on your last fight.
Can't wait to watch.
Really?
You said
you were a Virgo?
Oh, uh, I... um, a Gemini.
The, uh, twins, right? Yeah.
I love twins.
Uh-huh.
Come on, Vinnie!
Let's roll this motherfucker!
You ever think
about playing basketball?
You ever thought
about signing me?
Guys. Guys.
What the fuck
are we doing?
Vince doesn't want to show you
the movie with this crowd.
Holy shit.
What?
How bad is it?
Ari, it's...
No, you look nervous right now, Vince.
I'm not...
No, I've never
seen you nervous.
Just tell me,
does it suck?
No.
It doesn't suck.
Tell him it doesn't suck.
It doesn't suck.
Film!
Film! Film!
Film! Film!
Come on!
Fuckin' film!
Roll it, Vinnie!
Come on!
Just put it on!
Vinnie, show us
the fuckin' film!
Let's go, baby!
Hey, I-I-I'm gonna...
I'm gonna take care of it.
Vince? Time to get
this show on the road.
I'm getting some quality time
alone with Emily.
What's the runnin' time
on this?
140 minutes.
Jesus.
I like short movies,
Vince, you know?
And... and...
And comedies.
You ever seen
"Bad Grandpa"?
I'm calling this off.
That never gets old.
No... you know, fuck these guys.
Vince.
You know what? Give Travis
and Ari DVDs to take home.
Hold on.
Vince, let's see the...
I know, I-I can watch that
with Emily.
Hey, everyone.
Vinnie!
Good news and bad news.
The bad news
is the projector broke.
No! No, no.
Vinnie, no!
The good news is,
look who just showed up.
Pharrell!
Pharrell?
What the fuck is Pharrell?
Could we possibly convince you
to come up here and perform?
I'm gonna kill Vince.
My life is over.
No, it isn't, Ari.
Relax.
Relax, E?
You remember that Colombian
soccer player that got strung up
by his dick after giving up
the game-winning goal?
Well, that's where we're headed
if this movie tanks.
Vince will not come back
from this,
neither will I,
and neither will you.
Relax knowin' that!
I don't ask for much, do I?
Health and happiness
for the kids, peace on earth...
The wife to have bigger tits...
Only sometimes.
But I'm...
What are you doin'?
Nothin'.
You didn't come to bed.
No, I... I haven't...
What?
What,
are you praying?
Yeah.
Somethin' wrong with that?
Well, you don't
believe in God, so...
For the good stuff,
I do.
It's 2:00 a.m.
You sat down
to watch this movie at midnight.
I'm mentally prepping.
I'm gonna start now. You want to join me?
You said I couldn't.
Well, you could blow me
through it, in case it sucks.
Ease the pain?
Good luck.
I'll see you in bed.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Ah.
Don't fuck me on this,
Vinnie.
Don't you fuck me.
<i>Sadly, all good parties
must come to an end.</i>
Oh, come on.
There is no way
Emily would bang that Yokel.
I'm tellin' you...
She left with him.
I don't care.
No way.
These guys with money always
get women out of their league.
Oh, you mean
like Turtle and Ronda?
Oh, please... she's more likely
to break his windpipe
than bang
his malnourished ass.
Huh. We'll see.
We were textin' all night.
And she sent me a sexy pic.
Yeah, right.
Shut up.
Mm-hmm.
That's a fight-promo pic.
Not released yet,
though, bitch.
And she just said,
"I'm sending an uber for you
in 90 minutes,"
so...
Both of you.
Professional pics,
Uber car...
She wants somethin' from you,
and it ain't your dick, bro.
I agree... she probably
wants you to make her some money
now that
you're Mini-Mark Cuban.
That's fine.
Truth is, I-I'd rather work
with her than date her, anyway.
Oh, you are
so full of shit, Turtle.
Yeah, or maybe
those skinny pills he's takin'
are filled with estrogen.
Yo, yo.
Yo.
Hey, mornin', bro.
Any word from Ari?
Radio silence.
Ah, he probably hasn't even
watched it yet, Vin.
Yeah, maybe
his DVD player broke.
Hey, sit down, bro.
I made your favorite...
Hand-rolled croissants,
eggs Benedict with champagne
Sherry-Infused Bearnaise sauce
and freshly squeezed
Guava juice.
That's your favorite.
Johnny, this looks great,
but I'm not really hungry.
Hey, come on.
Even if Ari hated the movie,
who gives a shit?
He's still a fuckin' agent
at heart.
Yeah, seriously, bro.
Fuck Ari.
Yeah, fuck 'em.
Fuck Ari.
Thanks, guys.
It's Ari.
Think he heard us?
What'd he say?
He wants us
to go out front.
Why?
Wow.
Holy shit.
Look at this beauty!
I guess he didn't
hate the movie.
No, actually,
he loved it.
"Vinnie, I'm blown away.
Blown away.
And, E,
you've done good, too."
Any mention of me
in that note, bro?
All right,
here we go!
Yeah!
Oh, yeah, baby!
I really need an answer, Ari.
Time is running out.
Isn't my offering up my house
for the ceremony enough, Lloyd?
No, even though
that is so amazingly generous,
this is
so much more important to me.
I need more information.
Like what?
Like what will you be wearing?
I know
it can't be white
because you've been banged
more times than...
Ari!
Hey, Liam.
Go fuck yourself,
Ari.
Forgive and forget, buddy.
No?
Hey, schindler.
Leave no Jew behind!
Ari?!
Listen, Lloyd, I love you,
but I just...
I can't commit.
Really?
Oh, God.
Hey, Ari. Tell me
you're not parkin' there.
My studio, Ed. Don't force me to
revoke your parking privileges.
Fucking asshole!
Who is insane enough
to park in my spot, Allen?
Uh, I do not know.
Tow it.
Actually, you know what,
I'm in a good mood.
Just spit on it.
Oh, that's my car, Ari.
Travis Mccredle's here
to see you.
I can see that now.
Sorry.
Didn't know
where else to put it.
That's okay.
What's happening?
You get a chance
to look at
Vinnie chase's masterpiece
last night?
I did.
You got a minute to chat?
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.
Uh...
Great.
Hold all my calls,
Allen.
But remember you have
couples therapy at 11:00.
Oh, and... and, Ari.
Ari.
Do you still want me
to spit on his car?
Wow!
What a space.
Ah, it's comfy, huh?
You should see
my father's work office.
I bet your father has
a much nicer office than this.
No, my father
doesn't believe in
wastin' money
on extravagant office settings.
My father believes in
puttin' money into product,
whether that's pig's ears we're
sellin' for dogs to chew on
or methane gas
for middle easterners
to poison each other
with.
Yes.
Well, you know what?
I tried your father...
waitin' to hear back.
I spoke to him. I told him he didn't
need to call you until after we spoke.
Oh. I, obviously,
didn't like the movie
as much as you did, Ari.
No?
No, it's no masterpiece.
Ah. Not from these
eyes' perspective.
Well... and, uh, what type of
training do you have to judge that?
I went to the Austin P.A.
film academy for a semester,
and all my teachers said
I had tremendous taste.
I can... see it
in your wardrobe.
Look, Ari, I have thoughts
about this movie,
and my father would like
for you to take them seriously.
Thoughts?
You have notes?
Whatever
you want to call them.
But most of them
revolve around
cutting out
Vincent Chase's mutant brother.
Drama.
Yeah. He's an abomination
and he's got to go.
The challenge for me was
I was the only human
in that scene.
Everyone else
was living dead.
So how did that affect
how you played the role?
It didn't.
It couldn't.
I had to be real.
If I played into it,
no way it could be.
That's really interesting.
Yeah.
Now, come on, baby.
Show me a little nip.
Please?
You are relentless.
This is like our third session
since last night.
Yeah, well,
I'm a little stressed
about an audition
I got tomorrow,
and your voice,
it soothes me.
Take it as a compliment.
Fine.
Unbutton your pants.
Oh, yeah, baby.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, that's what
I'm talkin' about.
Jen!
Oh!
What the fuck are you doin'?
Randy! You're supposed to be
in chatsworth!
Who the fuck is this loser?
You don't need to
call me a loser, bro.
Jesus.
Put some fucking clothes on!
Oh, my God! You're not
supposed to be here! Listen to me!
I'm gonna find you, you hear me?
You're gonna pay for this.
I'm gonna hunt you down,
and you're gonna
fuckin' pay for this!
Johnny, I'm so sorry.
This wasn't...
Yo, Johnny,
want to drop me at editing?
Yeah, sure, bro.
What the fuck
are you doin'?
You think I should
start a Vodka company?
I think you would kill it.
But I don't even drink.
Really?
Uh, look.
I got a ton of ideas.
You should have
a fitness app
and, like,
your own clothing line.
What, you don't think
my brand's doing fine already?
I think you could always
be doing better, no?
I'm confused.
Is this a business meeting?
Uh...
'Cause I didn't know.
I didn't know either.
I-Is this a date?
I don't cook for people
who are tryin' to pitch me.
Whatever.
I thought a nice, normal guy
wanted to hang out for once.
I did! I do!
No one under 250 pounds ever
has the balls to talk to me.
I should've known better.
No, no. It's not like that.
You should go.
Just see yourself out, Turtle.
Ronda, come on.
You should go before
I feel like hitting something.
I'll call you an Uber.
An Uberx, actually.
Motherfuckin' asshole.
Well, what do you mean he won't
release any more money? Why not?
I'm dealing with it.
I thought you said
his opinion didn't matter.
It doesn't,
and I'm dealing with it.
Well,
you better deal fast,
'cause we can't finish the movie
without money.
Really? 'Cause I thought we could
finish it with Froot Loops.
You're funny
but did you tell Vince?
'Cause he's on his way
to editing.
I'm telling you
'cause it's your job,
along with going over budget and being
short, to tell him these things.
You need to call him 'cause
I'm walkin' into Lamaze class.
Nothing says
you're working hard
more than Lamaze class
at noon on a Wednesday, E.
Thanks for nothin'.
Hey, baby.
I'm excited for therapy.
Don't be.
It's a waste of fuckin' money.
Hey, Kelsey.
Ari. Melissa.
Hi.
You okay?
I'm here,
so I'm fucked.
Since you're here, I'm guessing
you're fucked as well.
Nice seein' ya!
This should be fun.
Breathe in.
1, 2, 3.
And continue.
What about the name Ryan?
For a boy or a girl?
Either.
I like it.
But Ryan Murphy
created "Glee."
And you think people
will confuse our baby with him?
If we name our baby Ryan Murphy,
then, yeah, I do.
Why does Chad Lowe
keep starin' at you?
Hey. How are you?
Would you stop?
What, I just
didn't know you were dating.
We went out a couple of times.
It's not a big deal.
Yeah. Wonder what the girl he's with
would think about that.
They're not together.
Then what are they doin'
in Lamaze class?
What are we doing
in Lamaze class?
This is a fucked-up town. Yeah.
You know what?
I think we're better off
if we don't question each other.
I agree. But tell me
you haven't had sex.
Oh, my God.
Are you serious?
Well, you can't, can you?
I mean,
with the baby in there.
I mean, you could hurt it,
right?
Oh, relax, Eric.
No,
I'm not having sex.
And not
because I haven't wanted to.
Because, I don't know
if you know this,
but pregnant women
can get very horny.
Problem is, nobody wants
to have sex with me.
I'd have sex with you.
Where are you headed
with this?
What, are you gonna
tell me you love me
and you want me back
again?
Who's talkin' about love?
I'm talkin' about sex.
I'm saying that I would
have sex with you right now
if you really need it.
I just don't want
to get emotional.
Do you know I haven't even
been held in 6 months?
I see that you're already
getting emotional.
Follow me home.
Seriously?
Yeah, sure.
Why not.
You're clean.
I trust you.
Sloan.
Yeah?
I'm not really
that clean.
What do you mean?
I had sex with someone
last night.
Oh, who?
The "I want your cock" texter?
No, someone else.
Actually, I had sex
with the texter yesterday also.
2 girls in 24 hours?
Well, not by design.
Who are you?
And why do you always
have to be so fucking honest?
'Cause that's
just who I am.
And I guess that's why
we're not together.
No. We're not together
'cause you fucked my stepmother.
Don't ever forget that.
And you told me that
if I came clean and admitted it,
you'd get over it,
so don't forget that.
I tried, Eric.
I mean,
I didn't move to New York
'cause I really
wanted to try... I did.
I'll talk to you later.
Hello.
It's Melanie.
I need you to meet me
at the little door in 30.
I didn't think
I'd hear from you.
Eric, this isn't a social call.
I'm pregnant.
And if you don't
meet me in 30,
the next call you're going to
get is from my attorney.
Eric.
I can't believe
I'm gonna say this,
but I'm willing
to try again.
Did you hear
what I said?
Uh...
Okay. Good talk.
So, why did you stop
taking the "Anger Meds,"
as you call them?
I didn't think they were working.
I did.
Except to affect me
in places that I just
didn't want to be affected.
Have you been unable
to maintain an erection?
I didn't say that.
Did I say that?
He's having trouble finishing.
M-meaning
that I can go all night.
Boom.
And now you feel
that he's reverting
back
to his past behaviors.
It's as if
we're in a time machine.
The past behaviors
that almost ended your marriage.
Yes.
You don't feel
that is true, Ari?
No, of course I don't
feel that it's true
'cause it's not true.
I promised my wife that if
she let me go back to work,
it would be nothing but fun,
and it has been.
I do almost nothing
but smile all day.
And the anger meds
didn't make me calm.
They just made me
not able to come,
which just
made me angry.
And just
made my wife sore.
Now, currently,
I am a little bit stressed
about this giant movie
because I haven't been able
to see it until yesterday.
Thank God
it's fucking amazing.
But suddenly, this little punk
bitch version of Forrest Gump
thinks that he has
the authority to weigh in
on cutting my
movie-star director's brother,
and his fuckin' foghorn leghorn
of a father won't call me back
to tell me
that he doesn't,
so, yes, I am
a tiny, tiny bit stressed,
which is normal, no?
Why don't we
keep the focus off work?
Tell her
what you did today.
What does that have to do
with anything?
He told
his ex-assistant
that he could have his wedding
at our house.
"Ex-assistant."
He's like a daughter to me.
You didn't even ask me.
Because I thought you'd like it.
What? 300 Gay men
running around in our yard?
You're making
bigoted assumptions now, baby.
Yeah, he said it was gonna be
a Toga-themed wedding
with glass dildos
as centerpieces.
That was a joke, obviously.
He has
these highs and lows.
It's, like, one minute
he's on the phone, screaming,
and the next,
he's on the ground, praying.
And I just have
this feeling in my gut
that he could explode
at any second.
It's just not true.
I told you
to turn that off.
I thought I did.
It could be the Texan
or Vince.
It's the studio.
It's... it's a new phone
she got me.
I don't know how
to turn the ringer off.
Turn the whole power off.
Well, I don't know how to.
It's the studio again.
Don't answer that.
Well, it must be important.
Don't.
It could be
about the texan or Vince.
I-I have to take it.
I...
What?
Did you show a cut
of Vince's movie
to Larsen Mccredle's son?
Yes.
How do you know?
The editor just called.
Apparently,
the kid showed up with notes.
Jesus.
Is Vince there?
Not yet.
But the kid said,
and I'm quoting,
"that pretty-boy director
is locked out,
along with everyone else,
until I say so."
Ari?
Ari?
I got to go, Dana.
I'm okay to continue.
Look, maybe
she did want to bang you.
My bad.
Yeah. Your bad.
You totally
got in my head.
Why don't you just call her
and apologize?
I already did. She sent me
straight to voice-mail.
Twice.
Look, Turtle, I'm sorry.
But I got my own problems
right now.
Don't fuck girls with boyfriends
and you wouldn't.
She never mentioned
she had a boyfriend.
I wouldn't
worry about it.
Unless she sells you out,
how's he gonna find you anyway?
Well,
maybe he recognized me.
Come on.
What are the odds of that?
Billion to one,
at least.
Could you please
not make fun of me?
Ever?
All right,
what's the problem?
You know what
I'm auditioning for tomorrow?
Victim number 3
on "The Mentalist."
An old, broken-down
male ballerina.
Good part?
You know, I know people have
looked at me as a joke
for the past 20 years.
But in Vince's movie,
it felt like I found something.
And I'm just praying
that people see it
and that things
really change for me.
I got a good feeling
that they will.
Thanks.
Hey, is that E?
No.
Maybe.
That is E.
Hang on.
Yo, E!
What are you doin'?
Nothing.
Where's your car?
Nobody walks in L.A., E.
You look stupid.
My life is over.
Come on, Travis!
Open the door!
I'm dealing with Ari
on this, Vince.
On what? Come on!
Just open the door!
Yo, Vinnie, what's up?
Yo, what's up, mark?
I'm doin' some loopin'
for "Ted 3."
3? How many of those
are you gonna do?
Shit, I'll do 20 if I can.
What's the matter?
Your girlfriend lock you out
of the editing room?
No, my co-financier.
You serious?
Well, my boys will break down
the fucking door right now.
I got the hamster here.
He's crazy. I'm crazy.
Vinnie.
What's up, Ari?
What kind of shit studio
you runnin' around here?
Mark, hey. Calm down. Dude, I'm calm.
But you better get excited.
I mean, you don't want
everybody around town
thinking that this is
how you treat your filmmakers.
Right? What the fuck is going on?
Listen.
I-I-I am
dealing with it.
Yeah, well, E said he's not
gonna release any more money.
Can he do that?
Ari.
He's got issues.
What, he doesn't like the movie?
It doesn't matter.
Tell him the truth.
Yeah, seriously.
Ari, come on, speak!
Tell him the truth.
Don't be shy.
He doesn't like Drama.
He wants
to cut him out.
Johnny?
Yeah.
That's fucked up,
Vince.
I'm doing my reality show
"Wahlburgers" right now at A&E.
If they try to cut out
my mother, I'd kill somebody.
Even if she sucked
as bad as Drama probably sucks.
Hey! You guys know Reggie
from Jordan, right?
Yep.
You guys want some shoes?
No, no,
we're good, Mark.
I'm not
cutting out Johnny.
No, you're not.
I will take care of it.
You better.
Oh, shit.
That's Ari Gold.
Have the redneck country-ass
hick in editing Bay 3
dragged off my lot.
If he resists,
you have my permission
to shoot him
in the fuckin' head!
You're like an NBA player, E.
You imagine when someone says,
"oh, you have twins?"
And he says,
"no, they're not twins.
One was born in October,
one was born in April."
Like miniature
Irish twins.
You know, you guys are funny,
but what am I gonna do?
Seriously.
Take a breath.
You don't even know if it's yours.
Or if she wants it.
Well,
she wants somethin'.
You guys
don't have to wait.
We know.
But we will anyway.
He's a fucking idiot.
Who cares what he thinks?
Someone, apparently,
'cause they're letting him
hold my film hostage.
Not to pile on...
What?
Well, my publicist called
and said
that "Just Jared" wants to know
if we're dating.
I don't care.
Up to you.
Tell them whatever
you're comfortable with.
That wasn't
their only question.
No?
No.
They wanted to confirm
that there's something wrong
with the movie, since
you canceled the screening.
Oh, Jesus.
What did you tell them?
That it was great.
What do you think?
Do you really think
it's great?
Yes.
Now stop.
You're too good-looking
to be insecure.
I'm gonna call E.
Fuck you doing?
We're hungry.
Eric.
Hey!
Paula.
Yeah, of course.
Hi. How are you?
Good. It's funny
running into you here.
I wanted
to talk to you today,
but we didn't even
exchange numbers.
Yeah, I know.
Sorry about that.
Do you mind
if I sit for a minute?
Uh, you know, actually,
I have a meeting right now.
Is there any way I can, uh,
I can call you later?
Um, we had sex last night,
so I'm gonna sit for one minute.
Okay.
Isn't that the girl
he banged last night?
I think so.
She the one
that got pregnant?
I can't keep up
with this guy anymore.
I just wanted to say that
that was really fast for me.
I don't usually do that
that fast.
Oh, me either.
It was something about you.
Like, you...
You just seemed so...
sweet and innocent.
Is that an act?
No.
Really?
Hey.
Hey.
Is that the other one?
I don't know.
I guess.
This could get ugly.
Should we do somethin'?
Yeah.
Take pictures.
What,
did you bring a date?
Oh, no, no, no. No.
We just ran into each other.
I just met him
last night.
Oh.
Is this your girlfriend?
Uh...
'Cause last night, you said
you didn't have a girlfriend.
I don't.
I don't have a girlfriend.
No, no, no.
I'm... I'm not his girlfriend.
Excuse me.
Although,
we did have sex...
Uh, yesterday.
Are you serious?
Yeah.
So did we.
Did he get you pregnant
also?
Not that I know of.
Well, you better check,
because
apparently,
he has very strong swimmers.
Okay, um, I will go
to the gyno today.
What time
did you guys have sex?
Like 6:00 a.m.
why?
Okay,
so you're fine.
I just... it's...
The reason why
I wanted to talk to you today...
This is, like,
embarrassing.
Um...
You might need to go to the doctor, too.
What?
I really don't want to talk
about this in front of her.
Talk about what?
Okay,
I might have something.
It's probably
not contagious.
Ew! Don't get nasty
with me, bitch.
Well, what do you have,
like herpes or something?
Can you shut the fuck up?
Shh. Girls, listen.
I-I don't know what to say
to both of you at the same time.
Why don't you just
say you're sorry
for being another typical
L.A. douchebag.
Because I'm not.
Well, we think you are.
Who runs around and uses
as many girls as he can.
I don't.
Well, we think you do.
"We"?
Yeah, we used to
live together, Eric.
We haven't spoken
in a little,
but we did this morning
and, somehow,
your name came up.
So you're not
really pregnant.
No.
And you don't have
herpes.
No!
Thank God!
This was pointless.
No, this isn't pointless.
I get the point.
Thank you.
Well, n-not thank you,
but, I mean, I'm sorry.
What the fuck?
Whew.
It's still too bleak.
Yes, this movie will be
an Oscar contender,
but it also has
commercial appeal, as well.
The poster needs to
let toothless guys in Texas,
who snort meth
and possibly fuck their sisters,
know that it's also fun
for a Saturday night.
If only
we could see it, Ari.
DVDs are being made as we speak.
Everyone can see it now.
You've seen it?
Oh, yes.
And it works?
Oh, it works, Dana.
I saw it last night.
It works so well,
in fact,
that tonight,
after everyone goes home,
I might sneak onto the set,
go into the Hyde laboratory,
and masturbate
into a beaker.
Ari.
John Ellis keeps calling.
The chairman of the studio?
I know who he is.
Uh, he's on the lot.
John Ellis is on the lot?
Yeah.
What'd he say?
He said to tell you to get
your ass up to his office. Now.
What should I, uh,
tell him?
You tell him to get his ass
down to my office.
Now!
Ari. Ari!
He said what?!
Motherfucker.
- I do a little light karate.
- This is how I keep...
Ari. Hey, buddy.
Dude, what's this
may 4th release date?
Are you kidding me?
I don't have any time for this.
Come on, dude. Are you serious?
Yeah, look, you know what?
I'll... I'll talk to marketing.
We'll get on it. Excuse me.
We're up against Tyler Perry,
let's go, let's go.
The new "Hunger Games"...
We'll get slaughtered!
Look, you know what...
I don't know you.
Hey, Warren.
What the hell did you do
to John Ellis?
It's all good.
You know how much
of the studio I own?
The whole thing.
Yeah, well,
fix it, Ari.
It's done.
Thank you, Warren.
Ari! Ari!
I-I can't now, Jess.
Are you kidding me?
I just got off the phone
with fucking kives,
and he said
that you still haven't greenlit
my passion project.
No, I know.
Jess, we're going...
What the fuck?!
You know...
Do you think I give a shit
about Zombie apocalypse?
What the fuck is that?
I'm dealing with a first-time director here
I know.
Who's more interested
in instagramming my ass.
Hashtag Jessica Alba's ass.
Well, ha... ha...
Are you kidding me?
Look me in the face.
Uh-huh.
I'm gonna walk off
this project
if you don't
greenlight my movie.
Done.
Swear.
I swear to you,
it's done.
Swear!
It's done. It's done.
On your mom!
Yeah, on my mom!
Are you
out of your fucking mind?
Relax, John.
Your heart.
I don't have
a heart problem.
No, but you're old.
You think this is funny?
You told me
when I took this job
that I wouldn't have to answer
to Mccredle.
I didn't know that you were gonna
go over budget on your first shot.
It doesn't matter what a movie costs.
Only what it makes.
This one
is going to make...
Ari, I put my reputation
on the line
to get you this job.
No, you begged me
to take this job.
Actually, you begged me
to take your job.
And then
you took your offer back
and told me that you were
going to groom me.
For one year!
And this is your idea
of grooming?
This is the new world.
We're all in it.
We minimize our risk.
And maximize
our position as pussies
by kowtowing
to cowtippers?
I told you,
with this movie,
I didn't want
any of their fucking farm money.
I didn't need it.
The board disagreed.
And so did I.
About how much you spent
and about how you made it.
So this is
all about Vince.
Nobody thought he had any
business directing this film,
but you
bullied it through.
That's why you wanted me
to succeed you.
I bully everything through.
Well, see it
any way you like.
I'm taking you
off this movie.
Dana Gordon
is in charge now.
We made a great movie that
this idiot is trying to fuck up.
This idiot's father owns
half the fucking negative,
and you know it.
He can toss it in the garbage
if he decides to.
You have the...
Dana has this covered.
You stay
the fuck out of it!
Hey, John,
you can't do this!
Ari, I just did.
Yo, E,
what the fuck?
I've been calling you
for at least 2 hours.
Sorry,
my phone's dead.
You cannot imagine
what I've been dealing with.
Vince, these girls out here
are crazy.
I'm never touching
another one again.
Why, because of this
or because no one'll let you?
Look, guys, you know
I love you all, but right now,
I don't give a fuck
about what you're talking about.
We got a real problem
with this Travis guy,
and I need my manager-producer
back now, okay?
Okay.
Did Ari tell you why he's not
gonna release the money?
He didn't like the movie?
What didn't he like?
Is it me?
Please,
for the love of God,
tell me it's not me
he didn't like.
What kind of a sick,
narcissistic fuck are you?
Not everything in the world
is about you.
Seriously, Drama.
Just cut me out,
bro.
Johnny, stop.
No, I get it.
Just cut me.
The good life
wasn't meant for me.
I was given the gift
of delusional confidence,
but not
any real talent.
Will you shut up
and put that shit down?
Seriously. You should be
drinking my Tequila anyway.
Real men drink Whiskey,
Turtle.
Vince.
I don't want you to fuck up
your movie because of me, bro.
You're worth more
to the universe than I am.
And I'm finally
okay with that.
Johnny.
This movie is what it is
because of you.
And 'cause of E
and even Turtle.
Because we do things we love,
not things some rich prick,
whose daddy gives him
everything, tells us to.
You're really good
in this movie.
Tell him, guys.
I didn't even think
you could act until I saw this.
Thanks.
Don't worry.
We'll handle it.
Hey, and if
it doesn't work out,
we can always move back
to Queens with Ma, right?
I don't want to go
back to Queens, bro!
I'll handle it.
I like the weather out here
too much.
- Hello?
- Guess what?
I know who you are,
tarvold from "Viking Quest."
And I'm gonna
fucking kill you!
Hey, pal,
guess what?
I'm already dead.
So fuckin' bring it!
Hey!
There he is.
Travis.
Thanks for making the time.
No, thank you
for Comin' to me.
How are you?
You're sittin' in on this, too?
Uh, yeah.
Okay.
Look, I'm real sorry
about earlier, Vince.
But that Ari just wouldn't
let me be heard.
He's probably just being
protective of me.
He's like that.
Well, I'm just being protective
of my money.
I'm like that.
We understand that.
I'm sorry...
I know we met before,
but what is your involvement
in this, again?
I'm the producer
of the movie.
A-and he's my manager.
Oh, yeah!
Y- uh, uh, you were the guy
on "Piers Morgan," uh...
Spinning pizza dough,
right?
Vince, y-you take care of
more people than Red Cross, huh?
I like to think
they take care of me.
It's probably best to
think of it that way, yeah.
Uh, so listen, I'd love to hear
your thoughts on the movie.
I know you have some issues
with my brother.
Yeah.
He's not good.
Well...
Yeah, I-I disagree.
It's probably 'cause
you're too close to it.
You can't see it clearly
'cause he's your brother.
As an artist,
I'm pretty unbiased.
Yeah, well,
maybe there's a bigger issue
that's making you
not like his character, Travis.
I mean, he's pretty pivotal
in the movie,
including the final scene.
I don't really understand
how you could just cut him out.
Yeah, I-I think that
bigger issue thing makes sense.
Oh. D-did you have
other problems with the movie?
Yeah, I did.
I gave Ari a whole list.
Maybe you could be
more specific.
Well, y-you're puttin' me in
an awkward position here, Vince,
'cause not only
are you the director,
you're the star
of the thing.
I-it's okay. I won't
take anything personally.
With a movie,
there are so many parts
that have to come together,
so tell me,
what exactly was it
that you didn't like?
Uh, well...
Okay.
Aside from your brother...
I didn't like you.
Oh. Understand, this is
really strange for me, Vince,
'cause I really am
a big fan of yours.
I'm probably the only person
in the whole world
who liked that "Medellin" thing
that you did.
But, with this,
you know,
it's like you were trying to do
this kooky thing,
like Johnny Depp did in...
In "Pirates of the Caribbean."
Now, what he did,
he went out on a limb.
And it could've been stupid,
but, God, it... it worked.
What you did here, though,
it... it just didn't.
And maybe that's 'cause
you directed the thing
and all you had was your buddy
lookin' over your shoulder.
You don't have anyone
who can come in and say,
"Hey, this is gettin'
kind of fucked up and goofy."
But it most certainly was.
You should have punched him
right in the fuckin' face.
Oh, believe me,
I thought about it.
Maybe we are too close to it.
Maybe I do suck.
Psssh.
You know what, bro?
If you do,
at least we suck together.
It's good, right, baby?
Yes, Ari.
You like it?
Yes.
But do you love it?
I love it.
You wouldn't lie to me,
would you?
No.
All right.
Then say it again.
I love it, Ari.
Then say it again, honey.
I love it!
It's the best movie
Vince has ever done!
Yeah.
Now can we finish?
The meds are still in me, baby.
I'm not sure I can.
Then get off, 'cause I was done,
like, 20 minutes ago.
I'm sorry.
It's this kid.
He's killin' me.
I know I haven't been great
to you lately, baby,
but you know that I didn't
come back to work for the money.
I came back
to leave a legacy.
To make my family proud.
And I want to go out
on my own terms,
and this kid
is trying to hobble me.
Like Tonya Harding.
And I can't have it,
'cause he's wrong.
Drama sucking,
I could've maybe bought that.
But Vince? No.
I'm a million percent sure
he is wrong.
It's just his opinion.
What can you do?
Thanks, Hector.
I won't be long.
What, Ari, no suit?
Not tonight, DV.
Who told you
where I was stayin'?
My office booked your room
for you.
Can I come in?
No.
'Cause you haven't returned
any of my fuckin' calls.
Ari,
I have people here.
I don't mind.
Oh. Sorry about that.
Didn't realize you were
in the middle of a work session.
Maybe
I should call security
and have your ass
dragged out of here.
How'd you like that?
Hey, I am sorry about that,
but we do have
what are known as protocols.
Even in
this lawless town.
My father
wants to shoot you.
Well, we could have
a Mexican standoff, then.
Because after looking
at your long list
of proposed changes to my movie,
I want to shoot myself,
because they don't
make any fucking sense.
I agree.
With what?
I'm graspin' at straws here,
Ari.
I-I don't know
how to fix my problems.
Vincent Chase is great
in this movie.
Bullshit. He sucks.
His too-pretty face
ruins the fuckin' thing.
It's distracting.
How the hell are you gonna
fix his face with editing?
I guess I'm not.
Which is why I told my father
we should just bite the bullet,
put some more money
into this thing,
and reshoot it with new actors
and a different director.
Reshoot?
Do you have any idea
what that'll cost?
That's your job
to figure out.
But I'll bet that there's
a cheap way to do it digitally.
Hell, I saw Tupac Shakur
in concert last year.
That guy's been dead
20 years.
You had no problem with Vince
at the party.
A fan, even.
Did something happen?
I don't know
what you're talkin' about.
What happened?
I don't know what the fuck
you're talkin' about, Ari,
but if you don't leave
right now,
I really will call security.
Come on, this guy's really gonna
screw up a $100 million movie
'cause of
a personal problem?
That's what Ari says.
He says he wants to replace me
with a hologram.
Can they even do that?
I was replaced
with a digital character once.
But that was
before filming began.
I mean, what could I possibly
have done to this guy?
Did you shake hands
when you met him?
These southerners are real
particular about their manners.
I think so.
Oh, boy. Armie Hammer,
12 o'clock.
Oh, good God.
Yo, Vinnie Chase.
The Deejay from Hell.
What's up, Armie?
What's up?
You know
that I was dating Emily, right?
Emily?
I thought
you guys broke up.
I don't see
how that fuckin' matters.
No, this isn't the time
or the place, but...
Just know that I will enjoy
sneaking up behind you
and snatchin' the fuckin' life
out of you.
You know what I'm talkin' about,
right, Drama?
You guys
enjoy your salads.
Well,
that was awkward.
He's a lot bigger
than I thought.
Why didn't you just tell him
it wasn't true?
Because it is true.
Really? Since when?
Since after the screening.
I went over there later
after she was done
watching the movie with Travis.
What?
A girl? This whole thing
is over a fuckin' girl?
You guys are being crazy.
I can't believe
you were with Emily
and you didn't tell us.
Why would I tell you?
'Cause most of the fun
of being with a girl that hot
is that you get to
tell your friends about it.
Turtle, I think
we define "fun" differently.
I can't believe this.
Believe what?
There's no way
Travis could possibly
know about this yesterday...
No way.
Why not?
He probably waited
outside of her house
after she got rid of him.
We're the only ones
dumb enough
to not realize
you'd go over there.
Come on.
That's ridiculous.
You don't think he drives
a yellow Lamborghini?
I know he does.
He had it on the lot. Why?
Jesus fuck.
You couldn't just hold off
one night?
We're a year
into this thing.
Seriously, Vin. And this movie's
gonna set up our next 20 years.
Yeah,
and give me a life.
I hope
she was worth it.
Guys,
are you really tellin' me
you think I should've stayed
away from her because of him?
I mean,
is that who we are?
I would've banged her.
Yeah, me, too.
Wife might even
give me a pass for her.
Ah, fuck him. No, seriously.
Fuck him.
All right,
we don't need him.
I'll put up
the $8 million we need.
How much fuckin' money
did this guy make?
Vin, I'm serious, and it's not
just 'cause I love you.
It's 'cause I love this movie.
I appreciate it, Turtle,
but I can't let you do that...
I'll put up the money.
I'll split it with you.
Thank you.
I'm strapped, bro.
All the love in this room
is really fuckin' touching,
but you can't do it...
It's Mccredle's movie.
He doesn't need or want your money.
So that's it?
No. I will handle this, as usual.
How?
Don't worry, Carrot bottom.
I got ideas. Later!
Later. Later. Later.
I can't believe
there's nothin' we can do.
I got an audition at 3:00.
Who wants to run lines with me?
Nah. No way. Not a chance.
Ah, Ronda
finally answered my text.
Really?
What'd she say?
She said,
"if you want to apologize,
do it in person,
like a man."
You guys
want to come with?
Sure.
Sure.
<i>You are the master
<i>of your universe, Om.
<i>If you control
your own physical universe.</i>
I will solve this problem.
<i>Calmness and control of breath
are keys to success.</i>
Om.
I will figure this out.
<i>Put fear to the side,
for fear will conquer you.</i>
Om.
I will let no man
see the darkness inside of me.
Om.
I will learn how to
stop this fucking phone
from overtaking
my fucking calming CD!
What?!
About the wedding, Ari.
Lloyd, I've got
bigger problems
than who's gonna give you away
at your big fat Gay wedding.
Call your boys at Grinder. I'm
sure there's an app for that.
Listen, Ari,
I just got finished talking
to a classroom of 8th graders
about the future
of the agenting business.
And as I looked at their
little faces, it hit me...
My father is not
coming to my wedding.
That is not my problem,
Lloyd.
Do you know
why he's not coming?
I don't care.
It's because he hasn't
spoken to me since I came out.
He didn't know
before that?
Who is he, the guy from
"The Crying Game"?
You're the closest thing
I have to a father now, Ari.
Lloyd!
I can't deal with this.
Not while I'm trying to figure
out how to save this movie,
which is the most important
investment I have ever made.
You invest in people,
Ari, not product.
That's why I have succeeded,
and that's why you will.
Oh, and, Ari?
What?
I love you.
Fuck!
Fuck!
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Fuck!
Still time to leave.
I don't think she saw you yet.
Oops!
Too late.
Hey, Ronda.
Hey, Turtle.
What, do you bring your backup
dancers with you everywhere?
Sorry, Vince.
Well, you said
if I wanted to apologize...
What is there, really,
to apologize about?
Yeah, I didn't want ya
to have the wrong idea.
And what
was the right idea?
I wanted...
Yeah, I want to take you out.
So, then, why this talk
about us doing business?
Ju... because this
guy got in my head, all right,
tellin' me that there's no way
you'd be interested in me, and...
Not very manly
to let another guy
influence what you do
with a lady, bro.
'Specially this guy.
Listen, Ronda.
Turtle's shy,
and he really likes you.
Promise, he could care less
about business.
Everyone in this town
has an angle.
I don't.
I really, really don't.
So let me prove it to you.
What do you want to do?
You want to
take me in the ring?
I'll let you beat me up
for a round.
Let me?
You know, he does box
and do some cardio.
I meant, like,
I won't fight back.
You couldn't last
30 seconds with me
if your life
depended on it.
Ooh.
Ooh.
I could really hurt you,
Turtle.
So I last 30 seconds,
you let me take you out
on a proper date.
Last 60 seconds,
and I'll let you fuck me.
How much time?!
3 seconds!
What do I do? What do I do?
Something! Anything!
Pray!
She's got the armbar!
That's not good!
Tap out, Turtle!
Time?
15 seconds!
Turtle! Tap out!
Tap or I'll break it.
How much time?
10 seconds!
Do you think I'm bluffing?
Tap out!
You won't do it!
It isn't worth it, Turtle.
Don't tap out!
Ronda, I don't quit.
I just wanted
to take you to dinner!
Fine!
Oh!
Ugh.
Larsen Mccredle's office.
It's Ari Gold again.
Mr. Gold, I have told you
20 times already,
Mr. Mccredle is unavailable
to speak with you.
And I told you 20 times
I need to speak with him.
Where's Dana?
Meeting.
Try him again
and tell him
it's an emergency
regarding his son.
Is everything okay
with Travis?
Have you seen the movie "Taken"?
Yes.
Think of me
as the Liam Neeson character
and Mr. Mccredle is my target
if I don't hear back from him.
Have you heard back from Dana?
She's still in that meeting.
What meeting?
Laura didn't know.
Have you tried
John Ellis again?
Yes. Apparently,
he's in the same meeting.
Think the Texas money guy's
in town.
And you don't think
this is information
that I could've used?
Where is this meeting?
I'm not supposed to say.
I can call Dana.
Where's
the fucking meeting?
John's house
in Santa Barbara.
Should I tell them
you're coming?
Nope!
Tell them to build
a big fuckin' bomb shelter.
No, I didn't study
these dance moves.
I was born with them.
No, I didn't... I didn't
study these dance moves.
Ahhh.
Euripides. Euripides. Uh...
Aeschylus, Aes...
...Can you do that to yourself, please?
Uh, it's my process,
asshole.
Euripides. Aeschylus. Douchebag.
Lemona, lumina, lino...
Lemona, luminum, linoleum.
Yeah, hey, mom.
No, I'm just
on this lame audition
with a bunch of shitheads.
Yep.
Johnny Chase?
Yeah.
You're next.
Oh. Don't
fuck this up, Drama.
Fuck you.
We know you will.
Jimmy Chase is next.
Hey.
Hey, Richard.
I didn't know you were doin' this.
Yeah.
That's great.
Now I'm excited.
Ah, thanks. Well, uh,
thanks for Comin' in, Jimmy.
"Jimmy"?
No?
Oh.
No.
Johnny.
That's my fault.
I'm so sorry.
It's "Johnny."
Sorry, Johnny.
I told him "Jimmy," I'm...
There was a Jimmy
in here earlier.
I think
that's what it was.
He's Vinnie Chase's brother.
I know.
No.
Yeah.
You're Vinnie Chase's brother?
Yeah.
Wow.
You look nothing like him.
Not even a little.
You know,
we've met before.
We have?
Yeah. "West Wing."
Oh. Did you
do an episode?
No, I got cast
in the pilot.
And then replaced
after the table read.
Huh.
Well, you missed
a pretty good run.
Uh-huh.
Any notes
before I get started?
Nope.
No notes, Johnny.
So whenever you're ready,
Johnny,
Sarah's gonna
read with you.
Okay.
Did you go to school for dance?
Oh, my God.
What?
I'm sorry.
Nothing.
Just keep... Keep going.
What?
Did you go to school for dance?
No, I didn't
study these dance moves.
I was born with them.
Oh, my God!
What?
Sorry, Johnny, honestly,
we're getting all this on tape,
and it's great, so just
keep reading with Sarah.
Sarah, just keep... yeah.
Sarah, keep goin'.
Would you describe yourself
as flexible?
Well, I guess you could say
I am pretty limber.
Jesus Christ!
Are you guys joking?
I'm tryin' to act here.
What the fuck are you lookin' at
that's so important?
We're lookin' at you,
Johnny.
We're looking at you.
<i>Are you familiar with
the penal code in this county?</i>
Here's the good news...
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>
I won't ever forget you again.
Raw emotion with Johnny Chase.
Oh, yeah. Ohhh.
We got a sex tape
from a huge star...
'S brother.
Oh, you like that?
He was having a video chat
with this girl,
it turned into sex,
her boyfriend posted it up
to revenge girlfriends.
<i>And, cut to the Chase!</i>
Oh, my fucking God.
Oh, good merciful God.
<i>Oh, yeah, babe.</i>
Oh, my God.
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>
Oh, God.
<i>That's what
I'm talkin' about!</i>
Oh, my God.
I know this fucking kid.
Oh, my God.
Eww.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
Over here, Johnny!
What the fuck you lookin' at?
How 'bout I shove that camera
up your ass, huh?
What are you lookin' at?
There! Right there!
Stop fuckin' lookin' at me.
What are you lookin' at?
You got a problem?
Stop lookin' at me.
I can't believe
you just ignored me yesterday.
I wasn't ignoring you.
He wasn't ignoring you.
So... oh, really?
We're all gonna do this?
Okay.
He didn't respond.
He had some crazy things
happen yesterday.
Well,
he didn't call me today.
You probably should've
called today, E.
Well, I didn't know
what to say.
He didn't know
what to say.
For 6 months,
he begs me to take him back.
Now I say
I'm willing to try,
and he doesn't
know what to say?
She's got a lot of anger
towards me.
You know, maybe you should
save this for later.
I said I'll keep trying
to get over it.
He's right. Maybe we should
save it till later.
No, I think we should
talk about this now.
Maybe
I shouldn't be here.
Why not?
You've been here for everything
else but the conception.
Good point.
E, say somethin'.
Stop.
Look, Sloan, I love you, okay?
You know that.
And there's nobody else
I'd rather be with.
But there's no more
trying.
You're either over the past
or you're not.
Yo! Guess who's got
the strongest
bones in
the Assante family?
No break?
Nope. Torn Labrum.
But dinner with Ronda is on.
So, Sloan, any way we can
get this labor process crankin'?
Really?
Oh, see what I'm sayin'? Let's go!
Turtle, move it. Let's go!
You guys were stopped.
Ari,
are you fucking crazy?
You can't land there!
Ah, but, John,
I just did.
Hello.
Must not
have gotten my invite.
Wow.
I know all of you.
Mr. Tisch, we shared a suite
at the super bowl.
Must not be the difference maker
that you claimed.
Meldman, all those nights
in Cabo...
Meaningless.
Larsen, you must not have gotten
all my messages.
And you must be a lot tougher
than you look.
Okay, this room is gonna be even
more hostile than I thought.
Which is interesting,
because I heard the purpose
of this meeting
was to fire me.
Where'd you hear that?
I heard it up here,
John.
Not from you,
who I've known for 20 years.
Not from you, Dana,
who I used to...
Anyway, you want to fire me
because Mr. Mccredle's son
doesn't like the movie
that I made.
Well, I don't think
you know the whole story.
Oh, really, Gold?
Well, I can't wait to hear the
fuckin' fairy tale you spin.
Me, too.
Shut up, Travis.
Travis doesn't really
hate the movie.
He hates Vince.
Dad, he's so full of shit.
What'd I say?
Why do... Do you want
a boot up your ass?
No.
Now, I have a son,
so this is hard.
Well, speak, God damn it.
This whole
thing is over a girl.
What girl?
Dad!
The show... I...
Shut up!
What fucking girl,
Gold?
Emily Ratajkowski.
Ohhh, I like her.
I do, too.
I don't know
what he's talkin' about.
Oh, come on, Travis.
You mean to tell me
that you didn't
sit outside her house,
after she told you
good night,
just waiting to see
if Vince showed up?
He fuckin' snuck in there
after me.
I put in
a whole night w...
Wow.
I wasn't even 100% sure
I was right.
You should know this,
Travis.
That's what movie stars
are supposed to do...
Walk into rooms and fuck girls
that civilians want.
That's why
they're movie stars.
You causin' trouble
over pussy again?
Dad, this is our money.
We financed this film.
And I don't think that
that pretty boy out there
should be allowed
to shit on me.
Wait outside.
Are you serious?
Yes, God damn it.
Wait outside.
I'm real sorry about that.
Um, I have a copy
of the movie.
Vinnie chase's
unfinished cut.
I think if you
take a look at it,
you're gonna see that
your money is in secure hands.
I saw it last night,
Larsen.
Really?
What'd you think?
It's amazing.
I told you.
Well, I don't need
to see the damn movie.
You people
do what you do,
but, uh, if anybody wants to see
more of my money,
he still has to go.
Larsen,
you heard what happened.
What I heard is
this man treated my son
like a horse's ass,
which he is.
But that's not really
the point.
You said you have a son,
Gold?
I do.
He's 12.
Well, I hope
when he grows up,
he's not a complete and utter
fuckin' buffoon like mine.
But just in case he is,
I hope the people
that respect you
at least pretend
to respect him.
I can't believe a website
would actually post
something like that.
They posted it as
"see Vincent Chase's brother
spank it
at Vincent Chase's pool."
That was my pool?
Mine.
Oh, well. I guess a sex tape
worked for Paris and Kim.
Maybe it'll
do good for Johnny.
Ah, nah, Vin. A girl playin'
with herself is one thing.
Drama doing it,
it's a whole horrifying other.
Absolutely the most vile,
disgusting thing
I have ever fuckin' seen.
Okay, Shauna.
Have you heard from him?
No... no, why?
Is he missing?
Called him like 10 times.
He won't pick up.
Try him again,
please?
I can get his face
on a milk carton.
You need to calm down.
Don't tell me
to calm down.
I'm here
because I can't calm down,
and I need to
see the doctor,
who can hopefully
calm me down.
Mr. Chase, he is
in with someone.
Oh, is he in with someone who's
been Comin' here for 15 years?
Somebody who had to
scrape up loose change
when insurance
wouldn't pay his bill?
Is he in with someone whose life
is in complete shambles?
Are you suicidal?
Oh, my God.
I don't know.
Well, if you aren't...
I am!
Okay, let...
Let me call 911
and have an ambulance come.
No, no, no.
Don't do that.
What are you lookin' at?
What?
What's on your screen?
Nothing.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
I'm a dead man!
I need the doctor.
Doc Feldman.
It's Johnny Chase.
I've been
a patient of yours
since you were workin'
that fuckin' strip mall in sherman oaks.
I need you right now,
God damn it,
so get your ass
out here.
I'm dyin'.
Put the phone down.
Sorry.
Motherfuck.
What, Turtle? What?
Will you please stop calling?
I can't talk right now.
What?
Really?
Johnny, what the hell
is goin' on?
Nothin', Doc.
All good.
I'm havin' a baby.
Congratulations.
You have a brand-new baby girl.
Ah.
Thank you.
She's amazing.
She looks just like you.
Ryan Murphy,
6 pounds 4 ounces,
born 19 minutes ago.
Yes!
You're a daddy!
Get over here.
Oh. Congrats.
Ah, congratulations!
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Well...
How's Sloan?
She's over it.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Do we have ourselves
a baby?
Because in
the grand scheme of things,
what the fuck else
matters?
We got a baby girl!
You're kidding.
Name?
Ryan.
Ryan Murphy?
Yeah, you like it?
Well, I read for
the teacher on "Glee"
6 times
and didn't get it.
But, yeah, I like it!
Piers Morgan?
What the fuck is Piers Morgan
calling you for?
Hello?
Hey, Vince.
It's Piers Morgan here.
Hey, Piers.
Listen, if this is about Emily,
I have no comment.
No, Vince. I've got no interest
in your sex life.
I'm calling to see
if you've got any comment
to make about Ari Gold?
As far as what?
Well, as far as
the big, breaking news.
He just resigned
from the studio.
I got to call you back.
What's with
the stunned face?
Please don't tell me
the baby looks like E.
Yeah, I "resigned."
That's just how I spun it
to save myself the humiliation.
Truth is,
they fired me.
Ari, I feel awful.
This is all because of me.
Nah,
it's because of me.
I got a big ego.
But there's a reason for that.
It's 'cause I'm always right!
Must have a big buyout,
though, no?
What,
am I on CNBC, Turtle?
But, yeah, it would've been big,
even by your standards.
"Would've been"?
$30 million.
I told them to lick my balls.
I don't take charity.
What, so you're just gonna let
them keep $30 million? No. Come on.
I told them I want an equity
stake in the movie for it.
Ari, are you serious?
You could lose all your money.
You're my mentos man,
Vinnie.
15 years we've
been together.
You think I'm gonna
abandon ship now?
Not even if the water's freezing
and the orchestra's playing.
Oh, great.
A "Titanic" reference.
Come on, Ari.
"Hyde's" gonna be a monster.
You just said
you're always right.
Until I'm wrong.
I'm kiddin', Drama.
Lighten up.
Warren buffett's
gonna be
blowin' us for investment advice
soon, you'll see.
I'm proud of you, Vinnie.
I'm real proud.
Proud of all of you.
Thanks, Ari.
Congrats again on the baby.
Thanks again.
Later.
Later.
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the 72nd Annual
Golden Globe Awards.
We're on the red carpet
live.
This is where you want to be,
and, Maria, already people are
starting to ask the question,
"who will
the big winners be?"
Mm-hmm. If you've been
paying attention,
you probably get the idea
that Vincent Chase and "Hyde"
are gonna
have a huge night.
That's right, Matt.
"Hyde" has been
a box office monster
with $450 million worldwide
and counting,
5 nominations, including best
picture and two acting nods.
And that
surprise of the year.
You have a best-supporting-actor
nomination for Johnny Chase,
and he's only in 4 scenes
in the movie.
What'd I tell you,
Turtle?
You visualize success,
you get it.
Yeah, but you've been
visualizing it for 20 years.
No. I've been verbalizing it.
There's a difference.
Do you think he's gonna be more
difficult to handle if he wins?
Oh, yeah.
Definitely.
Vincent Chase!
Hey, Terrence.
Congrats on everything.
So, how does it feel?
Yeah, I don't want to
speak for baby bro,
but it feels sick,
Terrence.
You can quote me
on that.
Congratulations.
You're getting a lot of credit
for the work you did
behind the scenes
on this movie.
Well, I'm a little more creative
than people give me credit for.
I've heard
you have other offers.
Can you tell us,
perhaps, are you gonna
run another studio
or something?
Well, Maria,
I may run a country.
There are a few
that could use my help.
Johnny!
Look over here!
Johnny!
- Mr. Chase!
- Vince!
And the award
for best supporting actor
in a motion picture goes to...
Get the fuck
out of here.
Sorry, I have... haven't seen...
I haven't
seen the movie yet.
I... I imagine
he's fantastic.
Give it up!
Johnny Chase, "Hyde"!
You won!
Get up!
You won!
Get up there!
Go! Go!
You can fuck it later.
You speak.
Victory!
Yeah!
You're doing fine,
Lloyd.
Thank you, Ari.
And you?
I may throw up.
Just breathe.
Ladies and gentlemen,
today we gather
to celebrate
one of life's
greatest moments.
The commitment that
these two men are about to make
is the most important commitment
anyone can make.
If you're not really Gay,
Lloyd,
now would probably
be the time to say so.
And if you are, Ari,
this is probably your time.
Don't kid yourself,
Sulu.
Mazel Tov!
Congratulations, Greg and Lloyd!
Who's the girl?
Uh,
this is Alyssa Miller.
Hi.
Yee-haw!
I don't understand.
Lloyd wanted a Jewish wedding?
Nah.
My house, my God.
Hm. L'Chaim.
L'Chaim, bitches!
Vinnie!
Get in here.
Come on, we need a group shot.
Come here.
I just don't like it.
Well, maybe you just
don't fuckin' get it,
you bean-counting
little suit.
Ask Vince.
See what he thinks.
What's that?
I got an idea.
Oh, yeah?
What is it?
It's about Vinnie.
And the boys.
And how they started
from nothing,
turned it into all of this.
Yeah.
Dumbest idea I've ever heard.
Yeah, I agree.
Oh, I don't know.
Is it?
Maybe it's a TV show.
Yeah.
Maybe I could direct.
Maybe Turtle, Sloan, Ronda,
or the fuckin' baby can.
Ari.
Okay,
everybody get together
and smile.
