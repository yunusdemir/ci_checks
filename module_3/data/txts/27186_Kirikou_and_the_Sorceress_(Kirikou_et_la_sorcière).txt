Kirikou and the sorceress
mother
bring me into the world!
A child who can speak from
his mother's womb
can bring himself into the world.
My name is kirikou.
Mother, wash me.
A child who can bring himself
into the world can wash himself.
Don't waste the water.
Karaba the sorceress
has dried up our spring.
Mother, where is my father?
He went to fight karaba
the sorceress
and she ate him up.
Mother, where are
my father's brothers?
They went to fight
karaba the sorceress
and she ate them up.
Mother, where are
my mother's brothers?
They went to fight karaba
the sorceress and
she ate them up.
Only the youngest is still alive.
Where is he?
On the road where flame trees grow
on his way to fight
karaba the sorceress.
Then i have to go
and help him!
Good morning, uncle.
I am your nephew, kirikou.
You can't be my nephew.
I have only just left my sister
and her baby was not yet born.
It is now, and it's me.
I'm coming to help you fight
karaba the sorceress.
Don't talk nonsense.
You can't possibly come with me
off you go, child!
He's got it.
Where does this child who runs
so fast come from?
One shouldn't fight
sorcerers and sorceresses
we've lost out last warrior...
in the old days...
a forest genie!
I'll never see my hat again.
Why, there's a hat.
That will give me an air of authority.
Am i walking to my death
like my brothers?
Don't be frightened, uncle,
i'm here.
But where are you?
Here.
Get down!
Oh, just a little longer.
It's really nice.
I can see for miles
through the little holes.
You can't come with me.
What's going to happen
is not for children.
Besides, you'll get in my way just
when my life is at stake.
It's too late!
Noble mistress
a man's coming this way!
Tremble with fear
tremble with joy
here she comes
here she is
tremble with joy
tremble with fear
for here is ka-ra-ba
what do you want, man?
We want you to stop making
us die of thirst
holding us to ransom,
and destroying us,
what price do you ask?
How dare you complain?
You have a waterhole
not far from here,
your womenfolk still have
some jewels hidden
away in their huts,
and you are still alive.
Uncle, watch out behind you!!
No, uncle, on the left!
Great!
You have a magic hat...
er... yes.
Why does it call you "uncle"?
Er... it's a very good mannered hat.
Give it to me.
Certainly not!
Good for you!
I'll leave your village in peace
if you give me that hat.
Er...
hey, you're not going to give me
to the sorceress are you?
Just think, in return for
that hat of yours
you'll be the village hero,
the one who brought peace!
Er...
on second thought, go on
do what she tells you.
Are you sure?
Yes, but be careful...
what do you say?
I'll accept the deal if you call off
every one of your fetishes.
I'll put the hat on the ground and
you must let me get away
before you pick it up.
It's a deal.
Bring it here.
Bring it back to me!
Uncle, bend down!
Are the fetishes after us?
No, i just wanted you to carry me.
It's my first day out
and i'm a little tired.
You, cheeky littke boy!
Why is karaba the sorceress wicked?
Should there be a reason?
Yes.
He's been punished
and is gone forever
here he is!
It's him!
He's back!
He's alive!
Come and see, our man's back!
It's unbelievable!
The sorceress hasn't eaten him!
He's the strongest!
He's a hero!
He's magnificient!
What a lovely hat!
Why - that's my hat!!
Er... yes, i found it on the road.
Who's that?!
Kirikou.
He says he's my nephew.
My son
he's your son?
He's tiny!
Yes, but i'm higher than you.
Oh...
the main thing is i get my hat back.
Give him back that hat!
Give us that hat!
Quick, give them the hat
or we're doomed!
What will happen when karaba
the sorceress realizes that
the hat isn't magic?
I hope she'll give it back to me.
Do you know why karaba
the sorceress is wicked?
Of course, i know everything.
Then why is it?
Er... because she's a sorceress.
But why is she a sorceress?
Oh, you're bothering me.
You're too young to understand.
Besides, curiosity kills the cat.
The fetish
this isn't a magic hat.
The women must bring the great
karaba all their gold.
Beware if you keep a single nugget!
But we've given her almost
everything already!
Beware if you keep a single nugget!
What are we going to do?
Obey! And try to buy back
the foolishness of some.
Mother, i want to go with you to
see karaba the sorceress.
You're already so much like the men
you want to see karaba the sorceress.
Noble mistress, here come
the wretched women
of the village with their gold.
Tremble with fear
tremble with joy
here she comes
here she is
tremble with joy
tremble with fear
for here is ka-ra-ba
oh karaba, here is all our gold.
Be merciful to us.
Beware if you've kept
a single nugget!
Karaba the sorceress
why are you wicked?
Why are you wicked?
Why, you are the voice
in the hat!
I am kirikou i know what i want
and i want to know
why you are wicked.
You wretched little toad
i could gobble you up just like that
but you are really
too small to bother with.
I shall wait till you are
a little bigger and
have more flesh
now, go away you all!
Your son brings us disgrace!
You've brought him up badly.
Kirikou will bring
bad luck to our village.
We've had bad luck in our village
for a long time
and kirikou saved his uncle's life.
Foolish mother.
Kirikou is too small
to save anybody
watch out!!
I hope the women didn't cheat
no!!!
No!
No!
No!
Mother, can't they put
the fire out?
No, our spring has dried up
and the water hole is too far off.
The cursed spring is over there
you can live without gold
but not without water.
You can't live without
those you love
karaba the sorceress is
gradually taking away all our men
our village is dying.
Did all the men
go to fight karaba?
Oh no!
But she ate those who didn't as well.
Karaba the sorceress is angry
and i am afraid she will try
to steal away our children.
Then i will stay to watch them.
Very well.
Shall we play horse riders?
Oh yes, oh yes.
It'll be fun!
Go away!
We're not talking to you!
You're too small
to play with us!
But... why?
We told you to go away.
Oh, what a lovely boat!
Let's get in!
Don't!!
What's up with him?
No, don't! It's the sorceress!
How do you know?
It's not the sorceress.
It's a dugout!
It's not going to eat us!
Don't!
Mind your own business
little worm!
I'm the captain!
It's nice...
come on, jump off the boat!
The dugout is
taking you to karaba's
jump off while it's still time!
We can't, we're scared!
I can't.
Help us!
It's karaba's dugout!
It's the end of them!
Let's swim to the shore
and run home
kirikou is not tall
but he is bold!
Where's the dugout?
There it is, noble mistress
gliding at the bottom of the river.
But where are the children?
They are on the shore
cheering little kirikou.
Kirikou!!!
Kirikou is not tall
but he is a bold!
But he is bold!
Kirikou is tiny
but he is mighty!
Kirikou is tiny
but he is mighty!
Kirikou is wise.
Do as he says and
the sorceress will not eat you.
I think we'd better
return to the village.
Oh, what a lovely tree!
We've never seen it before!
Stay away from it.
There he goes again!
This time it's got nothing
to do with the sorceress!
It's a tree with roots in the ground!
Don't climb that tree
don't eat its fruit!
We're fed up with you.
Who are you?
You're not the boss.
We like climbing up trees.
There's no harm done
as long as we don't eat its fruit.
No!!
It's nice up here!
You should join us.
He can't, he's too small
ha ha he!
Come down! Quick!
I'm not strong enough.
Shake around, shake the tree.
Harder, harder, quick
we're getting closer
to the sorceress's hut.
Is the tree here yet?
Er... no... yes...
i can't tell.
What? You can't tell!?
Where are the children?
Over there, in the forest
cheering little kirikou!
Kirikou!!
Kirikou is tiny
but he is mighty
he is mighty
kirikou frees us
from the sorceress
kirikou frees us
from the sorceress
mother, here's the water.
Thank you, kirikou.
The water hole is too far away
i am going to see what i can do
about the cursed spring.
The children have composed
a song about me.
Yes i know
hey, i've saved them twice...
where are the children?
At home with their mothers.
Then there's no more i can do.
What a stupid song!
He really is tiny!
I know, i haven't even seen him.
Where's kirikou
on his way to the cursed spring.
No-one will ever guess
the secret of the spring.
But if by some misfortune
someone did, they will drown.
Be careful! You are going
towards the cursed spring!!
Yes, i know.
But, it's forbidden!!
Do you hear me?
I want to take a look
there's nothing to see!
It's true.
I can't see anything at all.
I told you so!
There's nothing to hear either!
Yes, there is.
Aouch! Don't talk back
you rude little boy
aouch aouch aouch and go away!
Listen, go...
gone! He's rude but with some
discipline he'll learn to obey.
That noise is very close by
it comes from over there!
There's water still but that
creature drinks it all.
I must ask uncle to kill it
and we'll have water again.
Yes, but uncle can't get
through the hole,
no-one can, except me.
I have to kill this monster.
How disgusting!
Besides, i am really
much too small.
Anything i do would only
feel like a gnat bite!
Perhaps i'll think of
something once outside.
You again! Go away
you're bothering me.
You wretched little thief
give me back my poker!
Water!
Water's back!
Water!
The spring is flowing
water, water's flowing
water... water!
It's come back!
The spring is flowing!
How can that be?
Water
here's water
water we drink
how refreshing
water
here's water (bis)
Water
here's water
water that flows
it's our chance
water that laughs
water that's life
where is kirikou?
My poor friend, be brave.
He is in there, drowned.
Water
here's water
water that laughs
water that's life water...
water!
I told you so!
Kirikou!!
Is he dead?
Yes he drowned.
Kirikou is not tall
but he is bold
kirikou is tiny
but he's my buddy
kirikou is tiny
but he's my buddy
kirikou is a rascal
better than us all
kirikou is not grown
but he is our own
kirikou is a teaser
but a goodhearted one
kirikou is a teaser
but a goodhearted one
kirikou is tiny
but it's our buddy
kirikou is not grown
but he is our own
kirikou is...
i've won!
He has won!
Kirikou is tiny
but he is mighty
kirikou frees us
from the sorceress!
Kirikou is tiny
but he is mighty
kirikou is not tall
what's all that noise?
The villagers are
dancing by the spring.
What?!!
The spring's flowing?!!
Yes noble mistress.
What about kirikou, is he dead?
I think not
he is splashing his little friends.
Arrgh!!!
Kirikou, lie down and rest.
Very well.
Mother, why is karaba
the sorceress wicked?
I don't know.
She's not the only one.
That's true.
I've save some of those kids' lives,
yet they are unkind to me.
Of course.
There are always people
who want to hurt us
when we've done them no harm.
That's facts of life.
Like water can drown
or fire can burn.
Yes.
Facts of life.
All the same, she is much more
wicked than the others!
Or, she simply has more power.
Only the wise man of the mountain
can answer your questions.
Who is he?
Your grandfather.
Where does he live?
Beyond the sorceress's home on the
other side of the forbidden mountain.
Can i go and see him?
No.
Why?
The sorceress prevents
people from getting there.
Why?
The wise man of the mountain
explains things
the way they are
while the sorceress needs us
to believe all sorts of nonsense.
Nobody can get to the mountain.
But if i took the long way round
she won't see me.
The look-out fetish is watching
you all the time
he can spot an ant at the far
end of the savannah.
What if i went at night?
The look-out fetish can
see without light.
I wish i were bigger...!
Being big won't help it.
I have an idea, will you help me?
I will.
Noble mistress, kirikou's mother
is leaving her hut!
With kirikou?!
Without kirikou.
Then i'm not interested.
She's coming this way.
Whatever does she want?
She seems to be looking for
something on the ground.
Don't take your eyes off her!
She bends down to pick some plant.
She's gathering herbs
to make soup.
The way to the wise man of
the mountain is through
a big red termite mound.
How can i get inside the mound?
It will let you in if you are
worthy of being admitted.
Do you think i'm worthy?
I do.
We're coming to
the last of the bushes.
Beyond this point
because of the sorceress
plants don't grow.
Here's a burrow that will do.
Alright.
Here, take your father's dagger.
Thank you, mother.
Goodbye mother.
Good luck, kirikou.
I hope i won't make
any nasty encounter...
aahhh...
up or down?
Down. I'm still too close
to the sorceress.
Where is this taking me?
Ha...
should've taken the way up.
Can you see kirikou?
No, noble mistress
kirikou is still in the hut.
Don't take your eyes off it
killer-fetishesn be ready!!!
It's frightening
and it's funny.
If only she knew that
i am just beneath her feet!
This burrow doesn't go right
through the sorceress's territory!
It's normal.
It's too difficult
i'm not getting anywhere
i can't go any further
i'm exhausted
let's rest a little.
Ok!
Now i can dig all the way
to the mountain!
What is this?
How horrible! Bones and blood.
Where am i?
What a stench!!!
I can't breathe!
I shall suffocate!
I must get out of here!
Oh they're so cute!
I don't want to hurt you!
Alright, i'm going...
i am completely lost.
I've no idea which way i've come from
or which way the mountain is
nor the way out...
thank you
mm, it'sh good
thank you
thank you.
A spider
thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, what a beautiful flower!
Thank you.
Thank you.
This bird scares my friends away
that's not it.
Now i have to come out of
this hiding place
walk to the other side
of the mountain
without being seen...
that's impossible.
But i've always found a solution
let's see...
if i step away from this tree
the look-out fetish will see me
but if he doesn't know
that it's me, it's ok.
What can i dress up as?
As a squirrel? No i can't.
It's you again
alright, let's try this...
goodbye my friends.
Alright.
Let's go, one two three!
I must look ridiculous.
No one will ever
mistake me for a bird!
Mmmmm, mm, mmm!
How dreadful!
It's going to reveal my disguise
how ghastly!
I'm losing my feathers
you are not here
to look at birds!
Keep watch of kirikou!
Very well mistress!
Has he left the hul?
Noble mistress, he has not.
Keep watching
don't let yourself
distracted stupidly
i'm too heavy...
we made it!
They can't see us anymore!
I'm saved!
I'm making progress.
I should attach it on my back
still a long way to walk before
finding the big termite mound.
I'm free
and i'm safe!
How stupid of me!
Strapping the dagger to my back!
It seems like he can
see through rocks!
My smell! No need to hide
he can smell me!
This imbecile can't see
that i run faster than him.
Not for long though
i'm getting tired.
For now, i'm faster,
let's go!
Hey, you can't bite me.
I won't let go
i won't let go
i won't let go!
I held on...
looks like you have sensitive ears
how interesting...
i think i've foiund myself
a mount to explore the mountain...
the big termite mound!
Let's hope it'll open...
let's hope it'll open...
of course...
if i ride this animal
i can't go through
the big termite mound
i have to go alone
one, two, three
open
this isn't taking me anywhere!
And i can't get out.
Is this a trap?
This time i shall be on my guard!
Kl-rl-kou...
kl-rl-kou...
kl-rl-kou...
good day, grandfather!
Good day, kirikou.
I have been longing to see you.
So have i.
I was so afraid the termite
mound wouldn't open!
What would you have done
if it hadn't opened?
I would have dug a hole and
managed to get inside somehow.
I had what i needed:
My father's dagger.
I know. It was i
who gave it to him.
Grandfather, i am small
and i should like to be grown.
And when you are grown
will you want to be small?
Today, being tiny you have been
able to enter places where
no- one else could.
Be thankful.
And when you are grown
don't forget to be thankful.
Can you make me grown right now?
No.
Then there are some things
you don't know?
That's right
i know very few things.
Grandfather
how did karaba the sorceress
manage to put the monster
inside the spring?
She didn't put it there
it got in by itself.
It was very small
and it was thirsty.
Over the years it grew
and became more and more thirsty.
Is that all?
Yes.
Grandfather, why does
the sorceress eat people?
She doesn't.
What?!
That's what the villagers think,
karaba lets them go on thinking it
the more frightened
people are of her
the more powerful she is.
But she has never wanted
to eat a corpse.
She likes yams in a nice spicy sauce
just like you and i.
So it was not karaba that
took away our water supply,
she's never eaten anybody,
she prefers yams.
You'll end up telling me
that she's totally innocent
and that she loves everybody.
No! She doesn't like children,
she despises women,
she hates men
and she wants to do them
all the harm she can.
Is that so
why?
Because she is in pain.
She suffers night and
day without respite.
Why?
Because somebody once pushed
a poisonous thorn
into her spinal cord.
Why?
You are quite right
to keep asking me "why",
but from one "why" to the next
we'll go right back to the creation
of the world -and beyond that
knowing you-
we'll never have time to
talk about karaba the sorceress.
She is the one you came to ask about.
Very well.
Today i shall only ask questions
about the sorceress.
Why doesn't she pull out
the poisonous thorn
which hurts her day and night?
Turn round.
Try and touch the end of my finger.
Ah ooh... ;
it's impossible.
Besides the thorn is
embedded rather deeply.
One would need to take it
out with one's teeth.
Why doesn't she ask
a friend to do that?
She has no friend.
I see...
but if she thought that
some one knew the secret
of her thorn and wanted
to pull it out,
she would kill them.
Why?
If someone pulled out that thorn
she would feel more pain
in that moment than you
can possibly imagine.
She had some inkling of
that terrible pain
when some men seized her
and held her fast
while another drove in the thorn.
She would never want to
go through that again.
There is another reason...
it is that very thorn which
gives her her magic powers.
If it was removed
she would lose all those powers
at the same time.
Is that why she always stays at
home and never shows her back view?
That's right.
I shall remove the thorn from
the back of karaba the sorceress
or i shall die.
Grandfather, may i climb
on to your knees?
Sometimes i am tired
to fight on my own...
and a little small
and i'm a little frightened...
grandfather?
Yes, dear.
Will you give me a charm to
protect me from the sorceress?
No.
Your power lies in the absence
of a charm.
The sorceress knows all
about spells and charms
and tricks the men who think
they are protected.
On the other hand she has no idea
how to act when confronted with
barefaced innocence and a
free and alert intelligence.
Kirikou, i will be with you.
Goodbye, grandfather.
Goodbye, my son.
Great mistress
tiny kirikou is coming this way!
Good.
Killer-fetishes, get ready.
Make sure he doesn't get to
the forbidden mountain.
But he comes from the mountain!
What?!!!!
He is on the side of
the forbidden mountain.
How did he get there?
How could you let him get past?!
Everyone, go meet him and kill him!
Kirikou's disappeared.
You, guide them!
Great mistress
i can no longer see him...
what?!!!
Kirikou's disappeared.
As long as karaba the sorceress
is in her domain
with her fetishes around her
i can do nothing.
I have to get her out of her hut.
At last i'm going to see
what's in this hut
where no one else has been!
With her back to me
she can't see me!
But... nothing!
Ah...
of course
that must be the jewels basket
i can steal them
right under their nose
without anyone even realising it!
Who goes there?!
A rat, perhaps?
My jewels!!!
It's not possible!!
These fetishes are totally useless!
A hole in the ground!!
And these stupid fetishes
are too big to go down it!
Serpent, come here!!
Go on down! Find the
thief and kill him.
Oh dear!!
I haven't thought of this!
Can't run here
he's gaining on me.
Fewh!
Lmbecile! He tricked you!
I shall have to see to it myself!
And you up there
i suppose you can't see kirikou?
No, noble mistress.
Only kirikou would dare
commit such sacrilege...
as soon as he emerges
that's the end of him!
Kirikou is coming out of the ground!
He is wearing some gold necklaces.
He's making for the forest.
He is stopping beneath
the breadfruit tree.
He is digging a hole in the ground.
He is putting the jewels in.
Right, now it's my turn.
First the jewels,
then kirikou.
The game with the fetishes is over.
Give me my poisoned lance!
In a little while this little
animal will be pierced
with this lance
and that's the end of him.
Kirikou!
The pain's gone...
it's stopped hurting...
how strange to feel no more pain.
I am free!
The sorceress and for
her magic powers are gone,
alas for her...
but good riddance!
I am my old self once more...
kirikou, you've delivered me.
Thank you...
how can i prove my gratitude?
Marry me.
A small child can't marry
a grown-up lady.
You'll have to wait a little.
I don't want to wait.
Are you going to marry my uncle?
I am not going to marry anybody.
Sorceress or not
one thing won't change
i refuse to be anybody's servant.
If you were my wife you
would never be my servant.
All men say that before
they get married!
I'm not like them!
That's true, little kirikou.
One day, you will say
that to a nice little girl.
I don't like little girls!
To a young lady and...
she will be very fortunate...
would you place your lips on mine?
...well...
yes, of course i will.
You see, you haven't lost
all your magic powers.
The villagers won't
believe their eyes...
let's not go straight
back to the village.
No... this is so wonderful...
little kirikou should
have come back long ago.
Little kirikou will
never come back now.
Now that you are a man,
you can't go back
to the village naked,
i shall adorn your body.
Hurry up, i'm so impatient
they won't believe what they see.
Kirkou must be dead.
We'll never see
little kirikou again.
He has given his life for us.
He has saved us so many times
and did we even thank him?
We've never thanked him.
We've never told him
we loved him.
There's my village...
it seems so small now
i'm so happy to be back...
they haven't seen us yet...
my heart's beating.
You'll see, we know how to
party at my village.
The sorceress!!!
Aah
help!
It's the sorceress!
With a sorcerer!
Don't be afraid!
Come here!
Karaba is no longer a sorceress
and i am kirikou!
What?!
Don't make fun of
the child we loved.
I have grown, but i am still
the same kirikou!
We don't believe you!
Go away!
Don't turn away your kirikou!
Uncle, what do you say?
That man is not my nephew.
Uncle, whether big or small
you've never accepted me.
Go away!
Mother, please recognize me!
Mother
how handsome you have grown
my son.
So that really is kirikou!
It's amazing!
Of course, once you know
it's obvious.
He's so handsome...
yes, but now he's taken sides
with the sorceress.
I'm not altogether surprised.
He was a bit of a magician himself.
Be careful
that's right be careful
we're glad to have you back
but we don't want the sorceress!
Karaba is no longer a sorceress
and i can't live without her!
Then go and live with
her somewhere else!
I was speaking the truth
when i said i was kirikou,
and i am still speaking the truth
when i tell you
she is no longer a sorceress.
What of it?
Look at all the wicked she's done.
It's a good thing
she's lost her powers.
We can destroy her!
Death to the sorceress!
She's eaten my husband!
She's eaten my son!
She's eaten my betrothed!
She's eaten my father!
She's eaten my brothers!
No! She hasn't eaten anybody.
Liar!
Kirikou has not lied and
we must be forgiving.
Karaba did not eat those men.
She transformed them into objects
obedient objects.
But kirikou has delivered
karaba from her pain
and liberated these men
from their enchantment.
Here they are.
Kirikou has saved us.
Praise be to kirikou!
We were fetishes.
We are men.
We are the fathers.
We are the sons.
We are the brothers.
We are the husbands.
We are the nephews.
We are the friends.
We are the loved ones.
And we are returning
to those we love.
