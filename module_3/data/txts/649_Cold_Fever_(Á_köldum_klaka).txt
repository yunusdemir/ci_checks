Hey. Good morning.
Hi.
I didn't snore, did I?
'cause it's been reported
that on occasion --
Oh, shoot. What time is it?
Uh, it's like 7:00.
Ohh!
Man!
Well, you're not gonna
kick me out again, right?
'cause this is my house.
No, it's just that...
I have that plane I got to catch.
Oh.
All right, well...
You want breakfast?
You want me to make breakfast
or buy some breakfast,
Do something with breakfast?
That's sweet, but, uh...
No, thanks.
Oh. I'll get a coffee at the airport.
Oh, coffee. I got a -- I got a coffee maker.
I can -- it's probably on, and --
All right. I'll just walk you out, then.
All right, so...
See you when you get back. Yeah.
I'll miss you.
Yeah. I'm sorry.
<i>I'll miss you.</i>
Oh! Oh. I'm sorry.
Did I hurt you?
No, no. You surprised me. I just...
We don't say goodbye like that in my family.
So I'll call you. Great.
Great. All right. Bye.

So, yeah, he's coming in later,
And my intention is just
to re-up the contract,
But, uh, then I was looking at the website
Of this other parts guy, and, um...
Hey, guys. I was just telling --
Come over here and take a look at this.
Excuse me.
Ow.
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
S- sorry.
Whew!
sure, I'll do it, you son of a bitch!
No problem. Just send over the details.
Uh-huh. Yeah.
you, too.
Bye.
The lakers, man.
You know, once you're in,
they don't let you back out.
what do you need, son?
Well, I was wondering if I could maybe
steal your office for a quick minute.
Oh!
I'm having a sort of meeting
with some of the service guys,
And, you know, it's a
little tight in the cubicle.
The service guys, huh?
<i>Well, you know, that's not a space problem.</i>
<i>That's a dietary problem.</i>
Yeah, but, um...
So...
Well, I'm kind of in the middle
of some things right now.
But, you know, if I had more notice...
Well, uh, all right.
Um, how about this afternoon?
I got the parts distributor
coming in to talk contracts.
Of course. What time?
2:00. 2:00. Fine.
See? Just give me some notice.
These are yours.
Thanks so much, terry.
Congratulations.
Hey, marcus.
Looks like we're tied.
Say what, hollywood?
Check it out. We're tied.
Tied at three four days into the month?
Come on. That don't mean nothing, son.
Hey, tied is tied.
Care to back that up?
Uh...
Hey, you just said we're tied, right?
Yeah. So?
So, how 'bout a little wager?
No.
<i>Forget the month, 'cause we all
know that's gonna be me.</i>
How 'bout, uh...
Whoever has the most sales
by the end of the week?
Yeah, I-I-I don't know.
You got the desk by the front door.
It just doesn't really seem fair to me.
You think that's why I kick
everybody's ass around here?
I'm just saying -- okay.
Okay.
For the duration of the bet,
Any up comes near that desk,
you can have them.
And if you win,
You can have the goddamn desk.
oh, come on. I'm just kidding.
<i>But -- but if I win the bet...</i>
You got to get me coffee every
morning for the rest of the month.
<i>Which is more in line</i>
<i>With what you should be doing
around here anyway.</i>
You're on.
Okay. The end of the week.
Sure.
Hey, uh, can I get in on this?
Whatever.
Hey, reg, it's marcus over at thoreau.
Yeah, brother, listen.
I got a buyer for your '07.
Mm-hmm. And I can put you in something
brand-new with the same monthly.
Thing is...
Need it today.
See you soon.
Oh.
<i>He's not even gonna use walk-ins.</i>
<i>I did not see that coming.</i>
Yes.
Come on!
Ohh!
God, I want to punch a bird!
doing a mind bet?
Yeah. Yeah, how'd you know?
Whenever you say or do something weird,
It's usually a mind bet.
No, it's not weird.
It's good, actually.
It keeps me from, uh...
Well, it's not...
You know, it's fun.
That's all. It's not weird.
What did you bet?
Oh, I bet if I didn't make 10 in a row,
I couldn't watch tv tonight.
Which kind of sucks
'cause there's this special on
tsunamis that I want to see.
But, you know, whatever.
I'll tivo it and then watch it tomorrow.
Yeah, that's weird.
What's up? What's going on out there?
Oh, they called from that kid's party
To go pick up the bounce house,
And dashaun's not here yet,
And I'm still trying to get
the Halloween aisle together.
All right.
Um, I'll go with carlos, then.
Okay. All right.
Hey, don't forget,
I need you for that party tomorrow.
Do I have to, mr. T?
They asked for a princess.
What am I supposed to do, huh?
Besides, you're getting time and a half.
Come on. Stop.
Don't worry. The kids are gonna love you.
<i>I don't want the kids to love me.
I hate princesses.</i>
I hate all that stuff
That makes kids believe in dumb,
frilly, unreal crap
That's not real.
Don't say that at the party.
Well, we remember you... Uh, pete.
And, um, I see here by our records
That you bought your aveo in 2005,
And I just wanted to let you --
Okay.
Yeah, w-- yes -- yes, sir.
S- sorry to bother you.
Okay, o-okay. Very sorry.
Okay.
Hey.
Hi, we're here to, um...
Hey. We have to...
We've met, right? Have we met?
Yeah, you're joe.
Our kids go to school together.
They go to school together.
That's right. That's right.
You were at the range the other day.
Yeah. My friend hit on you.
She did? That's what that was?
Yeah.
See, wow. Oh, my god, I'm so, uh...
I didn't pick up on that.
You should've just told me flat-out.
Oh, well, you see,
now next time you'll know.
I'm bonnie, by the way.
Joe.
yeah, I know.
Kenneth, they're here to
pick up the bounce house!
I get? Yeah.
What happened? Everybody's gone already?
Ehh, not that many showed up.
Oh, really? Yeah.
I saw it coming.
Like, I tried to encourage him
Just to invite a few close friends
So in case of a low turnout,
It wouldn't be really obvious.
But he insisted on inviting the whole class.
He still do the jump.
What?
The boy.
He no come out. I can't take it down.
Kenneth!
You've got to get out, sweetie.
They've got to take it down.
No, you know what? I mean,
he's having fun now.
We'll give him -- give him a few minutes.
Let him go a little more! Really?
Yeah. Yeah, we don't have to --
how much time?
Uh, I don't know. Some more time.
Just, uh, 5 or 10 minutes.
I no clock! No clock!
Just let him jump -- 50 jumps.
Give him 50 more.
We'll figure it out, carlos.
Okay.
1...2...3...
100! Give him 100!
...4...5...
That's really nice.
Yeah, it's nothing. No problem at all.
No, no.
I mean, compared to the
humiliations my kids have had?
Really? Yeah.
Well, maybe not lucy.
She's the cool one. You know?
But albert.
He's like me -- albert.
Just...Socially awkward, bad with humans.
200! 50 more, carlos!
Okay? Just 50 more.
Okay.
So, what, um...
Do you, uh, golf at that place a lot?
Not really. My friend likes golf.
I mostly go for the tennis.
Oh, yeah? Tennis? Are you good?
Pretty good. Hmm.
Why? Do you play?
Uh, yeah. I mean, I've played.
You ever been beaten by a girl?
Uh...Well...
No.
I don't think I've ever
really liked a girl enough
<i>To let her win.</i>
I see.
Is that a challenge? Are you
challenging me? Wait a minute.
You threw the challenge down at me.
No, I just asked a question.
You came back all tough guy on me.
<i>Well, I can't help that.</i>
That's -- I just give that off.
I just exude tkat.
It's hard, you know?
<i>But if you take it as a challenge,</i>
Then, you know, I can't back down from it.
Oh. So...
How do you solve this?
What are you doing tonight, tough guy?
Um...
Am I losing to you at tennis?
50!
Oh, no. No, no, no. It's okay.
Kenneth has had enough.
All right, pull the plug, carlos.
Oh.
Whoa! Mom?!
W-- no, wait till he gets out!
That's right.
In what world are you dating two women?
Well, that's what I'm talking about.
I don't think I can do this.
What's the problem? "what's the problem?"
That's the problem. You. Being you.
That should hurt me, but it doesn't.
Yeah, look.
Don't be me.
Be joe. Be joe in this situation, right?
Michelle, the one I'm already...You know?
There's nothing wrong with her, exactly,
It's just, she's all...
Sexy?
And sexual and -- and --
I know it sounds like a good thing,
And it is. It is.
It's just...
Okay, like, here you go.
For example...
This morning, she's leaving,
D -- and she grabbed my crotch.
I- I-I'm not explaining it the right way.
<i>It was more the way she grabbed my crotch.</i>
<i>Is there a wrong way to do that, joe?</i>
What the hell is wrong with you,
man? It's good. No, look.
It's fun. It's all fun.
It's good. It's just...
I don't know if we're
on the same wavelength.
And with the other one you are.
I don't know. I mean...
It just seems like maybe...
She's more my speed.
You know? But I-I don't know. All right.
So, here's the thing.
You don't have enough information.
And the only way to get that
is to date both of them.
But, you see, that's the part
that I don't know how to do.
Then what?
All of a sudden, I'm with one,
And she's, "hey, what'd you do last night?"
And I was with the other one.
Now I-I got to -- I got to lie.
I'm, "uhh..."
And then I'm, what?
I'm wearing a fake mustache?
I got two cellphones? No.
Joe, just relax.
It's very simple, all right?
You just have to learn the
following helpful phrase.
"we don't have to define things right away."
This is like if your penis
could hire a lawyer.
What -- what -- what does that mean?
Just what it says. You don't
have to define things right away.
<i>Yeah, okay, and then when do you define
things? When she brings it up.</i>
<i>Or if you get to a point where you're
uncomfortable, then you bring it up.</i>
<i>Well, y-- and then what do you say?</i>
You say...
"look, I really like you, all right?
"but you should know that I'm not
at a point in my life right now
Where I'm looking for something serious."
So, either she's comfortable with that,
In which case, great.
Or she's not, in which case, she ends it.
Either way, you're in the clear.
I see why you hired this
guy to be a car salesman.
right?
Which, by the way, no.
He leaves a message,
Asking if I want to trade my truck in.
<i>Yo, he's still my customer, dude.</i>
That's what I told the sucker.
Yeah, trying to poach my ups.
I gave you a job. For shame.
Hey, hey. I made a bet, okay?
It was stupid. What do you mean a bet?
What kind of bet? A big bet?
What kind of bet? What?
What, oh, I can't ask about
other people's bets now?
Is that it?
All right. Whatever.
I'm dating two women at once,
So you guys can both shut the hell up.
you got that right, joe.
We on a roll!
that was my penis talking.
Yeah, we get it.
So, this is basically --
Ah, don't let me interrupt.
I got to get some --
Dale!
hey, man!
Hey, just doing some
business with your boy here.
Glad you kept it in the family.
Well, I'm glad we were able
to do the same with you.
I'll get right out of your way.
Um...
So, this is basically just an
extension at the current terms.
Is that all right?
Yeah. I mean, we just
have to make an adjustment
Now, where is my newspaper?
It's been a couple years
Since we hammered out the last one, so...
You know, I'm just talking about
a standard adjustment here.
Uh, well, um -- inflation?
Oh, don't tell me you gonna try
that dusty old gambit, dale.
It's not a gambit.
Don't piss from the roof
and tell me it's raining.
Who do you think you're talking to, dale?
Look, we've been at these
rates for three years.
And has your overhead gone
up in that amount of time?
Because if you have
numbers to that effect...
Look, let's just renew the old contract.
That's what I thought.
As a favor to a valued customer.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Listen, dale, now that I'm retiring,
I'm gonna be doing a lot
more of this lakers stuff.
They're having an unveiling tomorrow
Of this community center they're renovating.
There'll be games, autographs,
so you ought to bring the kids.
I just might do that.
Okay.
It's good seeing you, o.T.
3:00.
- All finished?
- Yeah.
Actually, you know what? I'm not sure I am.
W- what, you got another
meeting or something?
Uh, yeah, daddy, I do have another meeting.
In fact, I got a whole lot of them,
years of them,
As I'm now, or so I thought,
in charge of this dealership.
And to have to come begging
every time I need this office?
It undermines me. It undermines you.
Yeah, it undermines my efforts
to establish myself as --
From what I heard from
that so-called negotiation,
The only person undermining you is yourself.
There was no questions, no counter--
I didn't get a chance!
You swooped right in and took over!
Goddamn right I did, once I saw
you frozen in the headlights.
Excuse me? "frozen"?
Like a little baby deer.
Daddy, I took a breath!
Son, I just saved you thousands of dollars,
And you're in my face like that's a problem.
What do you thk I stick around here for?
You think I stick around for myself?
I got things to do.
And the only reason I stay around here
Is because you are still learning the ropes.
So, watch and learn, son...
While you still got the chance.
Watch and learn.
Well, you know, don't say it like that.
I mean, I'm just --
I'm trying something new.
But, so, are you not acting anymore?
Uh, well...
You know, I don't know. Nothing right now.
Listen, is there any chance you
want to buy something or...
Oh. I don't think so, no.
I am all set for now.
Okay. Well, um...
Nice -- nice, um... Talking with you, beck.
Yeah. And, um, good luck with this.
Thanks.
You know, I think this could
be really good for you, terry.
I mean, you weren't the most focused guy
When we were together, you know?
So, am I dressed okay?
This is basically golf with sneakers, right?
You're fine. Okay.
Ready? Yeah.
15-love. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
<i>You didn't say you were really good.</i>
Yes, I did. No, you didn't.
<i>You said you were pretty good. Ah, well...</i>
All right. No, it's okay.
So, I'm just --
I'm not gonna hold back, then.
Please don't. All right.
I'm going all out. Okay.
30-love.
So, no, then.
No. But I think this is a
good gig for you, terry.
Well...Thank you, jen.
Yeah, because who's better than you
At getting people to buy
something totally unreliable
That's probably going to
break down in six months
And leave you worse off than before?
You know...
I know that I wasn't, you know,
the most focused guy
When we were together.
Bye, terry.
Bye.
That's the match.
Yeah.
Had enough? Huh?
No, no, no.
Just getting started.
You sure? Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I'm good. Okay.
Oh! What happened?
We're out of balls.
Oh, well.
- Okay.
- Maybe next time.
Bye-bye then. Bye-bye, terry.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it was good.
Yeah? Yeah.
I'm gonna need, you know,
A couple months of physical therapy.
right.
And some of the other therapy, too,
Just to kind of rebuild my manhood.
But overall...
Well, I think it's very
manly to be a good sport.
Oh, really? Okay, you know what?
Next time, we're gonna play golf,
<i>And we'll see how manly you are.</i>
There's gonna be a next time.
Oh.
Yeah, I mean...
I hope so.
Me, too.
my kid is at my place.
My kids are at my place.
Huh.
Well...
Just stay here until
somebody yells, "get a room."
<i>You see, he can't have me be
the big dog, right?</i>
<i>As long as he's there,
he's got to be the big dog.</i>
And there's not enough room
for the two of you. I get it.
Are you listening to me?
There's literally not enough room
In my tiny excuse for an office
For me to do my job.
I'm just glad I get a day
to have a place to myself.
What do you mean?
He's gonna be out tomorrow at that --
Whatever the hell that lakers thing is.
Oh. Uh...
What?
Well, we're going to that.
What?!
I'm sorry!
Your father called and said
there'd be games for kids,
And then jamie and michael got all excited.
I'm sorry.
I already told the boys we'd go.
Then go.
<i>This is your father.</i>
Hi.
You must be, um, mr. Thoreau?
Call me o.T.
Sure. If you could just
wait here for right now?
We'll get started with the
autographs in a minute --
Hey, o.T.!
You finally showed up for one of these!
That's the joys of retirement, coop.
Well, some of us in the real world,
working for a living.
Some of your teammates are so old,
They couldn't even lift up
the phone to call me back.
That's cold.
No, seriously. Thanks for doing this.
I'll catch up with you later. Okay.
All right.
Huh? Wow!
Terry.
Dave!
Hey! Hey!
You got my message. Yeah.
How you been?
Oh, not so good. My wife's boning some guy.
What? Yeah.
We're splitting up.
There's lawyers. It's all pretty bad.
Oh, my god. Dave, I am so sorry.
Whatever, man. Let's talk cars!
Uh... What are you doing here?
I -- what do you --
I'm picking you up from school.
No, I told you, I'm going to reed's house.
Great. All right, well, I enjoyed the drive.
Cool. See ya! All right.
Don't get arrested.
Hey. Hi.
Hi, I'm joe.
I'm your mom's friend
from the birthday party,
Remember? Oh, hi.
Yeah. You need some help? Uh, yeah.
Give me that.
Thanks. Yeah. All right.
Where we going with this?
Science fair.
The science fair. Wow.
This is pretty cool.
Meanwhile, at the time,
She said the separate
beds were because I snore.
Now she's suddenly saying,
"we both knew that we were growing apart."
Well, if we both knew it,
how come I didn't know it?
Like I said, if there's anything I can do.
You're doing it, buddy.
I got that call from you,
and I just thought,
"the best revenge is living well," you know?
I'm gonna call my friend terry
and I'm gonna treat myself.
Since I'm a free agent now,
Man, think of the possibilities.
We could go out on the prowl.
Yeah. Together, as a team.
Hey, you know what else... What?
...Would really drive her nuts? What'that?
Oh, my god.
Wow.
Wow, wow, wow.
But I mean, this is obviously
A top-of-the-line deal here, ter.
Well, of course, but, you know...
Why don't you see how you feel in it?
Don't think about money.
And if you really want it,
We'll figure out a way to make it work.
What do you say?
Yeah! Why the hell not, right?
Why the hell not, huh?
Whoo! This thing is amazing!
How fast does it go?
Faster than a porsche 911 or a lamborghini,
But let's not find out, okay?
Aw, come on! Well, no.
We really want to get it
back to the lot in one piece.
Oh, no, we don't have to,
Because I'm gonna buy this thing!
You are?
Are you kidding?
Hey, ladies! Check out my car! Whoo!
I don't even know them!
Oh, man, I feel like celebrating.
I'm hungry. You hungry?
Uh, well, no, not really.
My treat. Come on. Okay.
Whoo!
So, what's your project on?
The life cycle of the lepidoptera.
Oh, yeah, I've heard of that.
That sounds like a dinosaur,
but it's a butterfly.
Yeah.
All right. There you go.
See, I've got all four stages in here.
Good. That's good. It's okay.
Nell made a volcano.
Yeah, but that's --
that's the obvious choice.
- This is good.
- Hey.
Oh, hey.
Uh, what's going on her
What's going on is we're
kicking some volcano butt,
Right, kenneth?
Right! great.
That's great.
Can I talk to you for a sec? Yeah, sure.
Sorry about the butt-kicking thing.
He was getting intimidated by the volcano
kid. Oh, no, it's -- that's fine.
I'm -- I'm more just...
I'm sorry.
How exactly did this come about?
Oh, yeah. No, I was -- I came by --
I was here to pick up albert,
and I saw him walking,
And he was having trouble
carrying his stuff, and I just --
I'm sorry. Is it weird?
No, no. It's sweet.
I mean, don't get me wrong.
It's very sweet, but...
Kenneth has had some bad experiences
With, um...Disappointment.
And it's just...
I mean, who knows? You know?
I mean, we haven't even had
our second date. Yeah, no, no.
No, I get it. I get it. I totally get it.
Which I'm very excited about, by the way.
Me, too. Me, too, yeah.
Good. Good.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no. You're right. You're right.
So... So...
I'll see you later?
I'll see you at, um, 7:30, right?
Yeah.
All right. Okay.
Now, we in the laker family
Want this place to be here
for a long time to come,
To continue to give the kids a home
Where they feel welcome and valued
And also to play a little ball.
Now, let's have a hand for my fellow lakers,
Michael cooper...
...And from way back in '72,
Owen "o.T." thoreau.
O.T.! O.T.!
I guess we're gonna sign some
autographs and take some photos.
Uh, but let me just, um,
say a couple of words' advice
To the kids out there.
<i>Um, it's good to dream big,</i>
<i>Um, but it's equally important to plan big.</i>
Um, now, I'm all in favor of
practicing your jump shot,
But let's face it,
We are all not going to, uh, make the pros.
So, educate yourselves.
Um, it's nice to be in the nba.
Um...It's also nice
<i>To have an mba.</i>
Okay, o.T.!
Thank you, o.T. Words of wisdom.
Thank you.
Now let's take some pictures.
Oh, hey. How'd it go?
I guess they bought it.
Good.
Isn't this great?
Yeah, yeah, it's --
My wife never wanted to come here with me.
Not her scene.
Well -- but you and me, man.
We could run through this place like
a pack of wild dogs. Am I right?
Oh, wingman, wingman.
Schwing!
Hey. What can I get for you guys?
I think I'm gonna have a sea breeze.
And my friend here...
Just an orange juice.
And an o.J. For my friend.
And your phone number.
Th-that's for me, not for my friend. Sorry.
But that was a joke. I was joking.
I'll be right back with your drinks. Okay.
Bye.
Ooh. She wants me.
Owen, why don't you take the boys up
To get granddad's autograph?
Here, I got you one, too.
What? No, that'll just make it worse.
Worse than this?
Go on. Go, go, go.
Hey, uh, guys, let's go
get granddad's signature.
Aw! I want james worthy's.
We'll get that next.
Let's just get granddad's. Hey.
Can I get an autograph?
Yes. Who should I make it out to?
Oh, you can make it out to dan.
Yeah, thanks.
Hey, coop.
Coop, man, while I'm up here, can I get --
I'm sorry, sir. I can't do that.
That wouldn't be fair to the
other people waiting in line.
Man, it doesn't work.
Hey, two real big fans
Of owen "o.T." thoreau, right here!
well, two future nba prospects.
Who should I make it out to?
Jamie. Right here.
And michael? Yeah?
He's an accountant.
How did she even meet another accountant?
That's, I mean --
that's betrayal too, you know?
Yeah.
Oh, and he's one of those hobby guys.
He fancies himself a gardener.
What the hell is that?
I'm gonna... Hit the men's room.
Be right back. All right?
Excuse me.
When you get a chance,
could we get our check?
Sure thing. Thanks.
And, look, my friend --
He's going through a really rough time.
I can see that.
Yeah, no, but, I mean, he really is.
His wife just left him, and, you know --
It would mean a lot if you could tell him
<i>You have a boyfriend --
I do have a boyfriend.</i>
Well, that's great. Good for you.
But -- but, um...
If you could give him the impression
That, if you didn't,
maybe you'd go out with him?
Or...
Or not, if that's --
No, no, no. That's -- that's really sweet.
Oh. Yeah.
Wow. You're a good friend.
Yeah. Thanks.
Yeah.
Thank you. Uh-huh.
Buddy...
It looked like the waitress and you -- whoa!
Whoa, whoa. What?
How many drinks did I get?
Well, you --
Well, I-I can drive if that's
what you're worried about.
No, I mean, look at this check.
I- I got to be more careful.
I -- with the --
With the legal fees and the
alimony and everything?
Man, I got to be, like -- I got it, okay?
What was I thinking? A corvette? I can't...
C- can you even see me in a corvette?
Well, yeah.
No.
You all right?
No, yeah. You're gonna need to drive home.
Hi. Hey.
Come on in. Yeah.
Actually, could we talk for one second?
Oh, out here? You don't want to --
well, yeah, yeah.
Just 'cause I-I was thinking
about what you said today.
Okay.
Yeah, and I think that you're right.
You're right. It's very early.
And, you know, because of that,
I just thought
That we didn't really need
to define things right away.
Right. Yeah.
Right.
Right, except it seems that --
That just automatically,
there's other factors that --
They're gonna define things for us,
Even if we...
You know?
And, I like spending time with you
And I want to spend more.
I just want to make sure that we're both...
Here's my thing.
I just got out of a 20-year marriage,
And I'm just...
You know, I'm not looking for
something that's -- yeah.
I mean, I get it.
Which is not to say that it's not --
Listen, listen, I --
I get it.
Are you sure? Really.
It's okay. Well, but --
Ah...
Okay.
You okay? Yep.
Wait.
Wait. Stop.
Are you gonna be --
If you're gonna be sick, we should --
Aw, dave.
Dave, just wait till you're inside.
The house is --
Hey!
Dave, shh! Hey, you!
Dave, what are you doing?
You pissed on our marriage,
I'm pissing on your rose bushes!
Dave, you're --
Ha! Dave, you're gonna wake her up.
Who? Your wife.
Oh, she's not here, terry.
Well, your kids, then!
What are you talking about?
This isn't my house.
What?
Hey, shithead! I'm talking to you!
Mr. Big accountant!
Me and my friend terry here -- all right.
Okay, we got to get back in the car, dave.
Where are you, terry?
Right over here. Come on.
Me and my friend terry here,
we are gonna kick your ass!
Okay, dave -- because it's not right!
Okay. It's not right!
Get in the car. Come on.
Freakin' humpty dumpty.
Huh?
Freakin' humpty dumpty! No,
no, no, no, no, no. Dave.
The damned thing didn't even break.
Yeah, you'd think of all things.
Forget it.
Come on.
Let's get you home.
There you go.
I'm sorry.
I wasted your whole night.
Pbht! No.
Whoo! Terry!
Yeah!
Go, go, go, go, go, go! Come on, man!
Punch it! Punch it!
Whoo!
Thinking about your dad?
Yeah.
Today he seemed so...Small.
Not used to it.
Well, even big stars get old.
And then they have to
make way for new stars.
Well, that's the thing.
He was never really a big star in the nba.
But at the dealership...
You know, I was so young
when he played ball,
I don't really remember it.
But what I do remember is
him behind that big desk,
You know, talking on the
phone and doing paperwork.
Just radiating this feeling that, um...
He was in charge.
Everything would be taken care of.
I could stand to have that
feeling a little longer.
You know?
Yeah.
Doesn't everybody have work to do?
Seriously?
What the hell are you d--
I don't drink coffee.
Well, then, why would you -- hey, hey.
A bet's a bet. All right?
And I expect a fresh cup
in my hand every day
For the rest of the month.
There you go.
Thanks, hollywood.
Hey... What?
I sold one. A bet's a bet.
You can have marcus' coffee.
Got to pay your bets.
Hey, daddy.
Son.
Listen, um...
About the office?
Yeah? Well, I was thinking.
People know you --
Customers, the other
businesses we deal with --
Um, you, um...
You know, you're the one they come to see.
Uh-huh.
And so, um...
I think that having you here, it, uh...
That projects an image
that people can believe in.
To see you here, doing what you do best.
You feeling sorry for me?
What? No.
'cause I don't need you
to feel sorry for me.
I -- daddy --
Gonna let me keep my own office.
Please, I built this place.
I know that. So, I don't need pity
From a pissant who's just getting started.
What do you need, an engraved invitation?
Take it. It's yours.
We did have -- we had 12 purple.
We got 12 purple.
We should have 12 pink.
We're at 9...
we're short one on a light pink.
I'm gonna get this.
Hey.
Hey, hot shot.
You didn't answer my text last night,
you little stinker.
Yeah. Yeah, sorry about that.
So, what were you doing, banging some ho?
Yeah, no. No, no.
Hey, I'm in town next week.
Oh, yeah? Yeah.
Clear your schedule for 2:00
a.M. A week from Thursday,
If you know what I mean,
