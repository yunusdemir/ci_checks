Gordita Beach, California
l. 1970
She came along the alley, and up the
backstairs the way she always used to.
Doc hadn't seen her for
over a year, nobody had.
Back then it was always
sandals, bottom half of
a flower-print bikini.
And a faded Country Joe
and the Fish T-shirt.
Tonight she was all
in flatland gear.
Hair a lot shorter
than he remembered.
Looking just like she
swore she'd never look.
Is that you Shasta?
Thinks he's hallucinating.
No, just a new package I guess.
I need your help Doc.
You know I have an office now.
It's like a day job
and everything.
I looked into the phone book,
I almost went over there.
Then I thought better for every one if
this looks like a secret rendezvous.
Somebody keeping a close eye?
Just spent an hour on surface streets
trying to make it look good.
You wanna beer?
How about a beer you and I?
Yeah.
There's this guy.
Gentleman of the straight
world persuasion?
Okay, Doc.
He's married.
Some money situation?
And the wife, she
knows about you?
She's seeing somebody too.
But it's not just
the usual lie,
I think they're working on
some creepy little scheme.
To make off with
hubby's fortune?
I heard of that happening
once or twice.
And you want me to
do what exactly?
They want me in on it.
They think I'm the one who can
reach him when he's vulnerable
as much as he ever gets.
Bare ass and asleep.
I Knew you'd understand.
Are you still trying to figure out
if it's right or wrong Shasta?
Worse than that.
How much loyalty I owe him.
Groovy!
All right if emotions aside...
Let's look at the rent.
How much of your rent
he's been picking up?
All of it.
Pretty hefty?
For Hancock Park?
You're giving him IOY's
for everything of course.
Fucker. If I'd known
you're still this bitter.
Me, trying to be
professional that's all.
All right, how much is the
Wifey and boyfriend offering
to cut you in for?
It isn't what you're
thinking Doc.
Don't worry thinking
comes later.
What else?
I'm not sure.
Sounds like they want to
commit him to a loony bin.
<i>Back when they were
together she can go weeks</i>
<i>without anything more
complicated than a pout</i>
<i>Now she's laying some
heavy combination of face</i>
<i>ingredients on Doc that
he couldn't read at all.</i>
<i>Come to think of it, there's never
been this much sorrow in her voice.</i>
Heard you're seeing
someone downtown?
Penny?
Some kind of junior D.A.?
You think somebody down there
can stop this before it happen?
Not too many places I
could go with this Doc.
I'll talk to Penny,
see what we can see.
Your happy couple, they
have names?
It's Micky Wolfmann.
Always in the paper? The
real estate big shot?
Yeah.
Can't tell anyone about this Doc.
Deaf and dumb, it's
kinda of my job.
How do I reach you?
You don't.
I move out of my old place
staying where I can anymore.
Don't ask.
There's room here.
Walk down my car?
Someone might be watching.
You never did let me down Doc.
Don't worry...
-No, I mean really ever.
No, you're always true.
You don't have to go.
Watch your toes.
INHERENT VICE
<i>Doc ran through all the things
he hadn't asked Shasta.</i>
<i>Like how much she's
come to depend on</i>
<i>Wolfmann's guaranteed
level of ease and power.</i>
<i>And least askable of all. how passionately
did she really feel about old Mickey.</i>
Hey, what's up Doc?
-Hey dude.
What's up man?
What's going on?
<i>Doc knew the likely reply:
I love him, what else!</i>
<i>With the unspoken foot note that the word
these days was being way too over used.</i>
You hungry?
Let's go eat some place.
<i>So when when Doc and Dino
came in that night.</i>
It wasn't just the usual
hungry doper thing.
<i>It was something else.</i>
<i>And with Neptune moving at last
out of it's Scorpio death trip.</i>
<i>And rising into the Sagitarian
light of the higher mind.</i>
<i>It was bound to be
something love related.</i>
<i>And I thought I
knew what it was.</i>
So...
She stuck her head
in for a minute.
You're feeling broken up?
It was kinda weird seeing
her again, you know?
You know I figured next time I
see her would be on the tube?
I mean not in person.
Well, you better do
something about this.
Again?
Can't tell you enough, change
your hair, change your life.
What do you recommend?
It's up to you, follow
your intuition?
Hello.
<i>Hey Aunt Reet.</i>
Yes honey, make it quick. I gotta live one
tonight, and I totally fucked up my face.
<i>Okay. Mickey Wolfmann,
what can you tell me?</i>
Power house in L.A real estate.
From the desert to the sea.
Technically Jewish but
wants to be a Nazi.
What's he to you?
<i>Possible case. Say I wanted to hang
out and rap with this Wolfmann?</i>
I'd say it's a really bad idea, he
goes around with a dozen bikers.
Mostly Aryan brotherhood alumni.
Wait, I flunked
social studies but
Jews and Aryan brotherhood, isn't
there something about hatred?
No, Mickey is eccentric,
more and more lately.
I'd say stoned out of his fucking
mind since he discovered drugs.
No offense to you Doc.
So where would I find him,
like accidentally?
Try the Channel View Estates, his
latest insult to the environment.
The one that BigFoot
Bijornsen does the commercial for?
<i>That's the one.</i>
Maybe your old copper is the one who
should be taking care of your case.
Yeah well I did think about going
to BigFoot with this but
Just as I reached for the
phone history and all, I thought...
Well may be you're better
off with the Nazis.
All right.
<i>I got major liquid-liner. If it's
all right I gotta get off now Larry.</i>
<i>Hey man, I don't want
you paying rent.</i>
<i>Rent's a hassle. I wanna
see you in your own pad.</i>
How did BigFoot?
<i>The Channel View Estates, Artige's newest
and grooviest housing development.</i>
<i>No buzz-kill credit checks,</i>
<i>No minimum down
payments, that's not your bag.</i>
<i>But check this out: fully
equipped kitchen.</i>
<i>With automatic self cleaning
oven and breakfast nook.</i>
<i>Out of sight.</i>
<i>Attached one car and
available two car garage.</i>
<i>And best of all.</i>
<i>A view of the domingus
flood controlled channel</i>
<i>that can only be
described in two words.</i>
<i>Right On!</i>
<i>What's up Doc?</i>
Michael Wolfmann, one of Los Angeles
most prominent real estate developers.
Has announced in a Wednesday
press conference.
He's proceeding with construction of
several new urban housing developments.
The most immediate to be
called Channel View Estates.
Doc.
-Howdy.
Pop came down last night
looking for you again.
BigFoot.
Yeah, that's the one.
I wonder why he didn't
kick-in my door as usual?
He might've been thinking about
it, but said something like
Tomorrow is another day.
Which would be today, right?
Micke Wolfmann's known for his outlandish
advertising, and aggressive style.
And has been actively
involved in the Southern
California real estate
development for the past...
Good morning Doc.
-Hey, good morning Petunia.
I love your Afro.
-Yeah?
Doc, you have someone
waiting in your office.
Doctor.
-Doctor.
Hi, there. Sorry to
keep you waiting.
Doctor Sportello?
That's right. What
is it my brother?
Peace. I'm Tariq Khalil.
Cool, sit down.
How can help you today?
There's this white boy I
was in the joint with
Aryan brotherhood. We did
some business and all.
Now we're both out and
he still owes me.
I can't tell you
the details but
It's a whole lot of money.
What about his name?
Glenn Charlock.
And you now where
he's staying now?
I know where he works.
He's a bodyguard for this
building named Wolfmann.
Pardon my asking Mr. Khalil,
how did you hear about me?
Sledge. Sledge Poutee.
Flash from
the past brother.
Yeah.
He said you helped him out
of a situation back in 67.
First time I got shot at.
I hope you don't mind
an obvious question.
You know where this Glenn
Charlock works?
Why not just go there and
look him up directly?
Well because, Wolfmann likes to surround
himself with the Aryan brotherhood.
Day and night.
You see, outside of Glenn, I ain't
never liked the company of Nazis.
So end somebody who might
get his head hammered?
More or less.
When you were inside,
were you in a gang?
The Black Gorilla Family.
And you say you did business with
who now? The Aryan brotherhood?
Listen.
We found we shared some of the similar
opinions about the U.S government.
That's all.
-I can dig.
There something else?
Matter of fact there is.
My old street gang the
Artiza Crips.
see when I came
home from chino.
I went looking for them and found
out they ain't just them gone.
But the whole turf itself.
What do you mean gone?
Man I'm talking not there.
Ground up into little pieces,
sea gulls pickin' all over it.
Man I thought I was tripping.
Got in my car, drove around,
came back, still gone
Nothing, nobody.
Just a ghost town.
With a big sign that said
coming to this site soon.
With a big ass ugly
picture of some houses.
And guess who the builder is?
-Let me guess.
Wolfmann again.
Can you show me
up here on this map?
Long, sad history
of L.A land use.
Mexican families.
Bounced out of shava's ravine
to build the Dodgers stadium.
American Indians swept out of
Bunker Hills for the music center.
And now Tariq's neighborhood.
Bulldozed aside for
Channel View Estates.
Hello.
Hi. I'm Jade, welcome
to Chick Planet massage
Please take note of today's
pussy eater special.
Which is all day
till closing time.
How much is it?
-14.95
Well not that 14.95 ain't
a totally groovy price.
But I'm actually trying to locate
this guy who works for Mr. Wolfmann?
Does he eat pussy?
Fella named Glenn Charlock?
Sure, Glenn, he
comes in here.
He eats pussy.
Well Glenn and I were in chino round
the same time, you seen hime today?
Are you a cop?
No.
The reason I ask is
if you're a cop.
You'd be entitled to a free preview
of our pussy eater special.
Well how about a licensed P.I?
Hey Bambi.
So where do we...
Not you bong brain.
I thought it was here, pussy
eaters special. Does that mean...
Congratulations, hippie scum.
Welcome to a world
of inconvenience.
<i>Well morning Sam.</i>
<i>Like a bad luck planet
in today's horoscope.</i>
<i>Here's the old, hippie-hating
mad dog himself.</i>
<i>In the flesh.</i>
<i>Lieutenant Detective Christian F.
'BigFoot' Bjornsen.</i>
<i>SAG member, John Wayne walk,</i>
<i>Flat top of Flintstones
proportion</i>
<i>And that little evil shit
twinkle in his eye that says.</i>
<i>Civil rights violations.</i>
What's up Doc?
How about your ex-girlfriend?
Shasta, Fay, Hepworth.
Shasta, Fay, Hepworth!
She's a known intimate
of Glen's employer
Mickey Wolfmann.
But do you think that
Glenn and Shasta were...
F U C K I N G ing.
Fuckinging?
Is that why you killed him?
BigFoot.
Just how does it
make you feel?
I mean here you are still
carrying the torch.
And here she is in the company
of all those Nazi lovers.
Keep doing that BigFoot
you"re giving me a hard on.
Tough little white monkey.
As my friend Fatso
Justin always says.
So our suspect, that's you...
was having alleged midday nap so
necessary to the hippie life style.
Some sort of incident occurs in the
vicinity of Channel View Estates.
Fire arms are discharged,
when the dust settles.
We found him on Glenn
Charlock deceased.
But more compellingly for LAPD.
Is the man Charlock was
supposed to be guarding...
Michael Z. Wolfmann has
vanished.
Giving local law
enforcement less than.
24 hours before the Feds call it a
kidnapping and come in to fuck.
Everything up.
So perhaps, Sportello, you
can help forestall this.
By providing the names of the
other members of your cult.
Cult?
No one would ever be stupid
enough to attempt this alone.
Which suggest some kind of Mansonoid
conspiracy, wouldn't you agree?
No.
Look I have been referred to.
More than one time,
by the L.A Times.
As a renaissance detective,
okay?
Which means I am many things.
One thing I am not is stupid.
So purely out of
noblesse oblige.
I extend this assumption
to cover you as well.
What the fuck?
Hey Saunch.
What's up Doc?
You know you have no case here.
So if you're gonna
charge him you better.
Otherwise, you have
to let him go.
Saunch, remember who this
is you're talking to,
this is BigFoot Bjornsen,
renaissance cop.
I know who he is.
So, what's the
beef here exactly?
It doesn't have much
to do with your
speciality which I
understand is Marine Law?
We got plenty of crime on
the high seas Lieutenant.
OK, well so far we have murder.
And kidnapping.
We can work-in pirates, if it
would make you more comfortable.
Either way it's high profile.
-Yeah but,
Given you history of
harassment with my client.
This will never
make it to trial.
No I think we could probably
take this all the way to trial.
But with our luck. The
jury pool will be 99%.
Hippie.
Well let's change the venue
to may be Orange County.
Not as many hippies
there you know?
Saunch, who are you working for?
Clients pay me for work Doc.
So?
I've decided I'm gonna kick Mr.
Sportello.
You're gonna kick him?
That's assault.
I think it's police Lang.
Saunch, it means cut me loose.
I'll release the suspect
at the impound Garage.
Promise?
I promise.
<i>Apparently a party of
civilians had some</i>
<i>training exercise in anti
guerrilla war fare.</i>
<i>They may have assumed this construction
site, not yet open for occupancy.</i>
<i>Was deserted enough to provide
a realistic setting.</i>
<i>For what we must assume was only
a harmless patriotic scenario.</i>
Hello.
-Hey, it's me.
<i>Hey.</i>
Listen, we...
We sent that police
academy hot shot over to
the last know address
of Shasta Fay Hepworth.
Fuck, no.
<i>Yeah they got there
and it was a...</i>
<i>they looked through
the window and a...</i>
What?
<i>Tried to open the door
and they just a...</i>
<i>they went in, you know!</i>
<i>She's gone...</i>
<i>Sportello, she's gone.</i>
She's out there man.
<i>Out there?</i>
Yeah.
<i>What does that mean?</i>
She's disappeared just
like her boyfriend Mickey,
and I thought you think
there's a connection.
<i>She's disappeared?
-Yeah, she's gone man, baby.</i>
She's gone? She disappeared?
What!
She went all groovy on us.
You know, BigFoot man.
can we just try to be fucking professional,
just, just pretend to be professional.
<i>Shasta Fay Hepworth, she's gone.
-Fuck you.</i>
<i>Doc could never figure out what
Shasta might've seen in him.</i>
<i>Besides being just about the only doper
she knew who didn't use heroin.</i>
<i>Freeing up a lot of
time for both of them.</i>
<i>And he wasn't any clearer about
what had driven them apart either.</i>
<i>They each gradually located a
different Karmic thermal.</i>
<i>Watching the other glide
away into different fates.</i>
<i>Does it ever end? Of
course it does, it did.</i>
<i>Hello.</i>
Hello.
<i>Mr. Sportello?</i>
<i>I got your number
from the head shop.</i>
<i>Down in Cordida beach.</i>
<i>I'm calling about my
husband, he was</i>
<i>A close friend of a
friend of yours.</i>
<i>Shasta Fay Hepworth?</i>
And your name is?
<i>Hope Harlingen.</i>
And your husband is?
<i>Dead.</i>
Sorry to hear that.
You wanna a cooky?
-I'm all right, thank you.
So you never heard
of him of his music?
Inside the surf-sax category
he was this towering figure.
Cause he actually improvised
once and a while.
Instead of just repeating the second
and third chorus note for note.
Coy and I should've met cute but
we actually met squalid.
Down in Oscar's in St.
Yesedra?
Oh boy!
I had just run into this bathroom
stall without checking first.
And I already had my finger down
my throat to vomit up this big.
Balloon of dope I
just scored and...
there Coy sat.
Gringo digestion about
to take this giant shit.
And we both let go at the
same time and there's
just vomit and shit
all over the place.
And with my head on his lap.
And to complicate things, he had this,
hard on.
Sure.
One thing leads to another and
We pretty much started shooting
up together on a regular basis.
Then, along comes
little Amethyst.
I don't know if you have
the stomach for it, but
This is what we had
her looking like.
Everybody helpfully
pointed out how.
The hair was actually coming
through my breast milk but
We couldn't afford
formula, you know.
It's a long way from
where we are now.
Yeah, no seems like
you're doing real good.
I'm a drug counselor.
Sorry?
A drug counselor?
Trying to talk kids
into sensible drug use.
What do you think
of my chompers?
You like them?
No no, I, yes, yeah.
I hadn't noticed.
The heroin sucks the calcium of
out of your body like a vampire.
If you use it for any length of time
your teeth just go all to hell.
And that's the good part.
So this thing that happened to
your husband, how can I help you?
Mr. Sportello I don't
think Coy is really dead.
Did you ID his body?
No.
Who ever it was
that called just.
Said that, one of his
band members did that.
What do you mean who ever called?
The police?
I mean it's
supposed to be next of kin.
And then this deposit shows up.
Close to his disappearance.
Interesting sum.
Why would this big deposit just
suddenly appear in my account?
I went to the bank, I talked to
the bank manager for an hour.
He kept saying over and over. You
just lost your deposit slip.
You just lost your deposit slip.
And I don't lose
deposit slips this big.
Do you have a spare picture
of Coy I could borrow?
That I do have.
<i>These were perilous times.</i>
<i>Astrologically
speaking for dopers.</i>
<i>Especially those of
high school age.</i>
<i>For being born, most of them,
under a 90 degree aspect.</i>
<i>The unluckiest angle possible.</i>
<i>Between Neptune.</i>
<i>The dopers' planet.</i>
<i>And Uranus, the planet
of rude surprises.</i>
<i>Doc had known it to happen that
those left behind would refuse.</i>
<i>To believe that
people they loved.</i>
<i>Or even took the same classes
with, were really dead.</i>
<i>They came up with all kinds
of alternate stories</i>
<i>so it wouldn't have to be true.</i>
How did Coy and Shasta
know each other?
She picked us up
hitchhiking once.
I think Coy and her stayed in touch
somehow, I don't really know for sure.
Alright well. I'll call
you when I know something.
Thank you.
<i>Shasta has mentioned a possible
laughing academy angle.</i>
<i>To Mickey Wolfmann's
matrimonial drama.</i>
<i>And Doc thought it might be
interesting to see how.</i>
<i>Society page super star, Mrs.
Sloane Wolfmann..</i>
<i>Would react when somebody
brought up the topic.</i>
<i>If Mickey was currently being held against
his will in some private nut house.</i>
<i>Then Doc's immediate chore would
be to try and find out which one.</i>
Do you like the lighting?
Jimmy Wong Hau did it
for us years ago.
Luz, the midday refrescos
now if you would't mind.
Shall we sit?
Now, your husband was planning to
endow a new wing for our facility.
He actually tendered
us a sum in advance.
Some how it didn't seem
right to keep the money.
While so little is known
of his where abouts.
so we'd like to
refund you the sum.
And if, as we all pray.
When Mr. Wolfmann is heard from again.
Well then perhaps.
The process can resume again.
We did recently endow
another facility in Ojai.
The Chryskylodon Institute.
Chriscolodon?
It's an ancient Indian
word that means serenity.
Of course.
Are you some how a subsidiary?
Perhaps one of our
sister sanatoria.
Mr. Riggs Warbling.
My spiritual coach.
How do you do?
-Pleasurable.
Well if you can tell where to send the
refund and what form you like it in.
Small bills, with
non-consecutive serials.
Riggs, enough.
He's always making these
terrible jokes, I'm so sorry.
Perhaps if one of your
company officers
simply endorsed Michael' check
back to one of his accounts.
Of course, let us know
the account number.
And its good as in the mail.
Let me find you the deposit form.
-Wonderful.
<i>So this is Riggs, the
spiritual advisor.</i>
<i>And there is Sloane.</i>
<i>Maybe not so much English
rose as English daffodil</i>
<i>and this is LAPD.</i>
<i>Busy as ever, protecting
and serving.</i>
<i>Getting in some last minute free
catering before the Feds show up.</i>
<i>And there's Luz, the sexy
chicana housekeeper</i>
<i>or pretending to be?</i>
<i>Some kidnapping.</i>
<i>Doc would bet an ounce
of seedless Hawaiian.</i>
<i>And then throw in a
pack of ZigZags</i>
<i>That Sloane and old Riggs
here were fucking regularly.</i>
<i>And that this was the BF
Shasta had mentioned.</i>
<i>Did Shasta have a
room of her own here?</i>
<i>Or did they all just
cozy up together?</i>
I'm ticklish little babe.
-I like that.
Keep looking, I'm in
there somewhere.
Vicky, Roxy...
Here. I am cute?
My tits aren't really that big
but it's the thought that counts.
Did all you ladies
pose for these?
A guy over in North
Hollywood does custom work.
And would about that
girl that's gone missing?
Shasta? She's
in there some place.
You know Mickey used to take
me to the shower to fuck.
And I never got to do anything
on that groovy bed in there.
Luz...
Another time perhaps?
BigFoot.
<i>Something has been puzzling
Doc now for a while.</i>
<i>Mainly, what exactly the
fuck was with BigFoot here?</i>
<i>As much as he liked
to stay and chat.</i>
<i>He had a lunch date to keep.</i>
<i>With part-time squeeze
deputy D.A Penny Kimball.</i>
<i>It was only because
someone else had canceled</i>
<i>that she was able
to pencil him in.</i>
<i>And Doc didn't want
to fuck up her act.</i>
<i>Considering they were
meeting in public.</i>
Hi.
This Wolfmann-Charlock case.
Apparently one of your
girlfriends is a principal.
I just heard that she skipped.
Let me put it to you like this.
How close were you to
this Shasta Fay Hepworth?
I've been asking myself
that very question.
It was all over years ago.
Months, I don't now.
-Years?
If you Hadn't you come along babe
who knows how bad it might'v got.
True, you were a fucking
mess when I met you.
How about now?
Old times aside.
Have you had any contact with her
in the last, say week or so?
Well, funny you should ask.
She called me up a couple of days ago
before Mickey Wolfmann disappeared.
Told me a story about how his
wife and her boyfriend.
Were plotting to hustle
Mickey into booby hatch.
And grab all his money?
So I sure hope that you
guys or the cops.
Or whoever, are
looking into that.
With your years of experience as a P.I
would you call that a reliable lead?
I've know worse.
I can did, you all
just gonna ignore that?
Some hippie chick with boyfriend
trouble, brain's all
mushed up with dope,
sex, and rock'n'roll?
Never seen you so emotional Doc.
-The lights are out usually.
I never see you
during the day Penny.
You didn't tell Lieut.
Bjornsten any of this.
When he pulled you in
at the crime scene.
OK, it's because I promised Shasta
I'd come talk to you first.
See if anybody at the D.A
shop can help out with this.
Now I tried to call you,
day and night no reply.
You tried to call me?
Day and night?
Look, I
forgot. I don't know.
All I know is that next
thing, Shasta's missing.
Wolfmann's gone and
Glenn Charlock is dead.
Bjornsten seems to think you
are as good a suspect as any.
Seems to? what do mean.
You've been talking
to BigFoot about me?
Doc, please.
Besides, maybe you did it.
Has that crossed your mind?
Maybe you just forgot?
-What? did do what?
Kill Glenn Charlock.
-Kill him?
Yeah.
-What?
How would I forget
something like that?
Grass, and who knows what else?
I'm only a light smoker.
How many joints
have you had today?
I have to check the log book.
-Can't remember?
I don't see how my
smoking has any link.
To the Wolfmann, Charlock,
Shasta case No?
Then how come Miss Hepworth
dismantled your relationship?
She got other fish to fry.
Would you say you're
still in love with her?
No.
Take off your glasses.
No.
I'm not, wait.
I've a hectic week ahead
of me, so unless things
heat up dramatically.
I hope you understand.
Walk me back to work?
I'm agent Flatweed, this
is agent Borderline FBI
I just have to use the bathroom.
It's been brought to our attention
that not too long ago.
You had a visit from a black prison
militant calling himself Tariq Khalil.
We naturally became curious.
Let's talk upstairs Larry.
Did I miss an episode?
I love you guys every
sunday night at 8 pm.
We like investigating
and spending energy.
On black nationalist
hate groups.
It's the chronology really.
Khalil visits you
place of business.
The next day a know prison
acquaintance of his.
Glenn Charlock, is slain.
Michael Wolfmann disappears and you
get arrested on suspicion and
Somewhat mysteriously
let go again.
Well have you talked to BigFoot
Bjornsen about all this?
Cause he's gonna tell you
about this kinda shit.
Mr. Bjornsen's antipathy at the
federal level is well known.
Some guys are like that.
What is it you want with me?
Ordinarily we're the ones
asking the questions here.
Sure thing fellas but
Aren't we all in
the same business?
There's no need to be insulting
Why don't you just go
ahead and tell us.
What Mr. Khalil had to say when
he visited you the other day?
Cause it's privileged, and
I'm inclined, that's why.
If it has a bearing on
the Wolfmann case.
Then we may have to disagree.
Look, I really wish I could
help you guys out but
I can't figure is if you're so
focused on the black panthers,
then what's with your interest
in Mickey Wolfmann...
Unless somebody playing Monopoly
with federal housing money?
You figure Mickey's kidnapping
is a black panther operation?
They put the snatch on Mickey trying to
prove a political point, or maybe
A nice shot at
some ransom money.
So maybe you'v at least
start putting that
forward as a cover up story
for what did happen.
Do you realize how thoroughly
we can fuck your life up?
All right... could I
be frank a minute?
Why stop now, please.
You be Dino, you
be the other guy.
And tell Penny Davis Jr.
What a lovely day we had.
Thank you.
As a COINTELPRO informant
you could be making.
Up to $300 a month Larry.
Just, consider that.
U.S dollars?
And we'll through in a
book of Mormon free.
Doc, a mysterious young
Oriental cutie.
Just dropped off a package for
you at the front desk.
Well, it's dark and lonely work but
somebody's gotta do it, right?
<i>Heard they cut you loose.</i>
<i>Need to see you
about something.</i>
<i>I'm working week nights at
club Asiatique in San Pedro.</i>
<i>Love and peace, Jade</i>
<i>P.S beware The Golden Fang.</i>
I can't stay out here long this
is golden fang territory.
And a girl don't necessarily want to get
into difficulties with those folks.
What is it? A band?
You wish
I just wanted to say
how sorry I was.
I felt shitty about what I did.
Which is what again?
I'm not a snitch.
The cops said they'd drop
charges if we just put you.
In the scene which they
already new you were.
So where's the harm. I'm
like so sorry Larry.
Call me Doc, that's cool Jade.
That copper?
-BigFoot?
He's a warped sheet of plastic.
So was it BigFoot who put me
on the buenos notches express.
Or did he sub-contract it?
I missed all that man. Last thing I
remember was eating Bambi's pussy.
And Puck Beaverton's
tattoo like it was pulsating.
Puck. What's a Puck Beaverton?
He's a bald headed asshole with a
swastika tattoo you don't wanna meet.
Me and Bambi were so
afraid with the bad ass
brigade stomping in there,
we didn't stick around.
Listen, there's somebody
who want's to talk to you.
He thinks you can
help each other out.
He's a new face, I'm not
sure of his name but.
I know he's in some trouble.
I would've come by your office man but I
thought there might be unfriendly eyeballs.
Well is this safe
enough for you out here?
Let's light this and pretend
we came out to smoke.
I'm supposed to be dead -Well,
there's also a rumor that you're not.
That don't come as such great news.
Being
dead is part of my job
image like what I do.
You're working for these
people here at the club?
I don't know, maybe, it's
where I pickup my pay check.
Where are you staying?
House in Topanga Canyon.
Band I used to play
for, The Boards.
But none of them know it's me.
How come they don't
know it's you?
Even when I was alive they
didn't know it's me.
The sax player,
the session guy.
Plus over the years there's been
a big turnover in personnel.
But The Boards I played with
most of'em gone off and
formed other bands.
Only one or two of the old
crew left, and luckily,
they're suffering from
heavy doper's memory.
The story is that you came to
grief behind some bad smack.
You still into that?
No.
I'm clean these days.
I spent my time
rehabilitating up in...
It's OK, it's OK, I can't hear too good and
how can I talk about what I don't hear?
Look, the thing I wanted
to see you about is
I wondered if you could check
on a couple of people.
Lady and a little girl.
See if they're OK without
bringing me into it.
Staying out in Torrance. Just see
if they're still living there.
See what's in the drive way, law
enforcement in the picture.
Or any details you
find interesting.
All right, I'm on it.
I can't pay you right now.
When you can.
Unless you're one of
those folks who believes
information is money
in which case.
I could ask you something.
Bearing in mind that
either I don't know.
Or if it's my ass
if I tell you.
What is it?
Ever heard of the Golden Fang?
Sure, it's a boat.
A boat.
Big schooner, somebody said,
she brings stuff in and
out of the country but nobody
wants to talk about it.
Because?
That was it.
How do you know?
I saw it sail in when
I got here tonight.
I don't know what I just saw.
Me neither.
In fact, I don't
even wanna know.
Okay, Doc figured it might've
been easier to let Coy know.
That Hope and little Amethyst
were doing just fine.
But he had a rule against getting
involved in matrimonials.
Which had just
gone up in smoke.
Like the Asian indica in the
joint they've been smoking,
creating an extra layer
of fog on top of the
one Doc was already
standing inside of.
Meet the schooner Golden Fang.
Out of Charlotte Amalie.
Where is that?
-U.S Virgin Islands
Bermuda Triangle?
Close enough.
Sizable vessel.
She has a tendency to show up
here in the middle of the night.
No running lights,
no radio traffic.
See the problem with this vessel
is trying to find out anything.
People back off, change the
subject and get real creepy.
The owners are listed as a
consortium in the Bahamas.
Her real name, isn't
really the Golden Fang.
She was originally a fishing
boat named Preserved.
Then after World War II she
was bought by Burke Stodger.
Burke Stodger the actor? '45
Caliber Kiss off' Burke Stodger?
The movie star.
He gets blacklisted
because of his politics.
And branded a communist.
So he takes the boat,
splits the country.
Which is where your Bermuda
Triangle comes in.
Hi, I'm Chlorinda,
how can I help you?
Well, I'm gonna have the house
anchovy loaf to start.
And, um, the devil-ray filet.
Can I get that deep-fried in beer batter?
-It's your stomach.
What can I get for
you little buddy?
I'll take the jellyfish teriyaki
croquettes and the Eel Travatore please.
OK. And to drink gentlemen?
You're gonna want to get good
and fucked up before this meal.
That's for sure.
I have some recommendations,
maybe the Tequila Zombie?
Make it two. -Thank you.
So Burke's black listed,
takes the boat.
Splits the country.
Somewhere between San Pedro and
Papetee the boat disappears.
Disappears till one day, a
couple of years later.
The boat and the owner
suddenly reappear.
You dig?
The Preserved, is in the
opposite ocean off of Cuba.
And Burke Stodger, on the front
page of the Daily Variety
in an article reporting
his return to pictures
in a major motion picture
called: Commie Confidential.
So Burke
is working again.
And his politics have
miraculously changed.
And the ship?
They removed any traces
of soul she once had,
it's a horror story.
Are you emotionally involved?
With the boat?
She's not just a boat Doc.
She's much more than that.
What?
I know why I'm so interested.
But why are you?
That story I heard the other night,
something about a smuggling angle.
And that story you heard.
Did it happen to include
Mickey Wolfmann?
Not so far, why?
Well, according to scuttlebutt,
shortly before he disappeared.
Mickey Wolfmann was seen taking
the Golden Fang out for.
A three hour tour, or should
I say a three hour tour.
And was he accompanied
by his lovely companion?
Okay.
My fucking Ex, old Shasta Fay!
-I know who she is.
But Doc I thought you were done
with all that sad bullshit.
Listen, did everybody
make it back OK?
Nobody was pushed overboard,
nothing like that?
Actually the word I'm
hearing is that Mickey
Wolfmann might not be
as missing as we think.
Like gone but not gone.
Man, you're gonna love this.
The rumor is that the department
of justice is trying...
Here you go.
-Thank you.
The word I'm hearing is
that the department of
justice is trying to broker
a Vegas deal for him.
Doesn't compute. Say again.
Vegas, Wolfmann.
FBI stuff.
They need somebody else on the
strip, who's not Italian.
You dig? Like Howard Hughes
when he bought the Desert Inn.
Howard Hughes was Italian?
No, they want white people.
They want white, Anglo
owners on the strip.
Who better than Mickey Wolfmann?
Hello.
<i>All right Doc, so she just departed
San Pedro on board The Golden Fang.</i>
<i>Who?
-Your ex, Shasta Fay.</i>
Shasta is on the
on the Golden Fang?
<i>My friend at DoJ just called me.</i>
Where is it going?
<i>Out at sea someplace.</i>
<i>Out at sea someplace.
Where?</i>
<i>Not known, not known.</i>
<i>Hang tight, I'm gonna get back to you
-All right, call me...</i>
<i>Penny Kimball, deputy D.A</i>
Hey.
<i>Who is this?</i>
It's me.
<i>Where did you get this number?</i>
It's Doc.
<i>I thought you'd never
wanna speak to me again.</i>
I didn't.
I didn't mind talking to the FBI.
<i>Am I in trouble?</i>
I don't know are you?
It's an awful nice night
out here at the beach.
<i>But you're a dirty
filthy hippie.</i>
<i>What would a nice clean
girl like me do with you?</i>
You could...
Bring your soap and
clean my feet.
<i>No thank you.</i>
<i>But then again I could
bring you a pizza.</i>
<i>I can hear your pants growing.</i>
So...
<i>I'll be there in an hour.
Go wash your feet.</i>
The dumb.
Hugging on the dumb.
That's the best thing
I've heard all day.
No, what the fuck.
What, who?
That's no hippie, that's Chucky.
Yeah? He's
friend of yours?
Everybody know Chucky.
If he's not at the Hall of Justice,
he's down at the Glass House.
A snitch?
Informant, please.
He only works with
the Red Squad.
So what' he, why is he screaming
and yelling like that at Nixon again?
Now he's been on TV he has
instant and wide credibility.
Police can infiltrate him
into any group they want to.
Bastards.
Do you love me?
<i>A snitch, a spy, a weasel.</i>
<i>And damn. If it ain't a
resurrected sax tenor player.</i>
<i>Working under cover,
but for who?</i>
<i>These patriotic pals of President
Nixon called Vigilant California?</i>
<i>Some other unseen hand?</i>
Now, who am I again?
-You're the photographer.
And the name of the magazine is...
-Stone Turntable.
<i>Coy's band, The Boards, were currently
renting a place in Topanga Canyon.</i>
<i>From a Bass player turned
record company executive.</i>
<i>Which trend watchers took as further
evidence of the end of Hollywood</i>
<i>if not the world as
they have known it.</i>
<i>Doc and Denis hadn't dropped acid
for years in this town without</i>
<i>Picking up some kind of
extra-sensory chops.</i>
<i>And truth was</i>
<i>Since crossing the door
sill of this place</i>
<i>They couldn't help noticing what
you would call an atmosphere.</i>
What are you playin'?
I drove up with Bambi.
She heard Spotted Dick
were staying here, so I
had to come over and
keep her out of trouble?
She's possessed. She's got Spotted Dick
black-light posters on the walls.
Spotted Dick sheets and
pillow cases on the beds.
Spotted Dick T-shirts.
-She's team dick.
For 24 hours a day she's got
Spotted Dick albums on stereo man.
Listen, I'm looking for that guy I met
at Club Asiatique the other night?
He's here
-Where?
He's in the kitchen.
-The kitchen?
Hey, when you leave, can
I get a ride with you?
This place is freaking me out.
Okay.
Good Evening, Larry Sportello,
Stone Turntable magazine?
Split Lits, Spotted
Dick, keyboards.
<i>Was it possible that
at every gathering.</i>
<i>Concert, peace rally, love-in, be-in
and freak-in.</i>
<i>Here up, north back,
east where ever.</i>
<i>Some dark crews had
been busy all along</i>
<i>reclaiming the music.</i>
<i>The resistance to power. The sexual
desire from epic to everyday?</i>
<i>All they could sweep up for the
ancient forces of greed and fear.</i>
<i>He thought. I don't know.</i>
Hey
-Hi.
Look it there remember me?
Larry Sportello,
StoneTurntable magazine?
You asked me to
look into that vehicle.
What?
-The vehicle?
What was the make and
model that you looked at again?
You were asking about that older type.
VW with the hearts and bluebirds.
Any replacement parts?
None I could see.
You didn't see any replacement.
What about street legal?
Was there any hassles
with registration?
No, I didn't see anything.
You saw Hope?
For a minute she's OK.
Looks like she's been
staying clean too.
How did she do it?
I don't know she's back
teaching is all she said.
Where?
Where? I don't know,
she didn't say.
It didn't matter.
No way I could go
ever back to them.
All right man look, you can't go
back to them, 'cause what? Why?
Because it would be my ass
and my family's too.
It's like a gang, it's like once
you're in you're in for life.
Did you know that
when you signed up?
All I knew is we couldn't do each
other any good staying together.
The baby looked like shit,
getting worse every day.
We were just getting fucked
up and sitting there.
Saying we gotta do something.
We're dragging ourselves down.
Listen, I'm not asking you to
give away any secrets here.
But I think I saw you on the
tube at a rally for Nixon.
And your question is
which side am I on?
Yes.
Well.
You know, these people
here have money.
It's not like those bible freaks that go up
and down the beach like screaming at you.
They really wanna help.
I thought it was something
good to do for my country.
As stupid as that sounds.
But what I really found
out was they just wanna
like use us and keep the
membership in line.
My country, right or wrong, with Vietnam
going on is just fucking crazy.
Suppose your mom was on smack.
My mom?
What would you do?
Wouldn't you try to help her?
-I think...
Are you saying that the
U.S is somebody's mom?
And she's strung out?
On what?
Sending people off to die
in jungles for no reason.
Something wrong and suicidal
about that that she can't stop.
And Vigilant California, or whoever it
is you're working for wouldn't buy that?
I don't belong here man.
I do get the feeling you'd
rather be someplace else.
Back where I
was would be nice.
Listen, I did just
run a fast check.
We gotta find some angle that
maybe you haven't thought of
Listen, nothing personal, but there's
too much you haven't thought of.
I can dig you're trying
to chase me off of this.
But whatever it is you're caught inside,
I'm out here, on the outside of it.
I can move in ways you
may not be able to.
How did the baby look?
Amethyst?
Sweetie pie.
She looked good?
-Yeah.
No sign of them
little-kid blues?
Little-kid blues?
You know that happens,
they get that.
No, I could see it.
You saw it a little bit,
I blew this solo man.
Where does it come from?
Give me a glimpse here man, who
set you up with these people?
You know when I first started
snitching, I realized how often
people ask questions they
already know the answers to.
They just wanna hear it
from another voice
like one outside their head.
You better find Shasta Fay.
Shasta Fay.
Thanks for the lift
boys. -Jade.
You said in your note
to beware of the Golden
Fang. Why am I supposed
to beware of a boat?
They're an Indo-Chinese
Heroin cartel.
A vertical package, they grow
it, bring it in, step on it.
Run state side networks of
local street dealers and
take a separate percentage
off of each operation.
So your dealing smack?
No, but they use Chick Planet
as a front to launder money.
See you around.
<i>Reluctant, may be even
a little desperate.</i>
<i>Doc figured he had to
go visit BigFoot now.</i>
<i>On principle, he tried to spend as little
time around the glass house as possible.</i>
<i>All this strange alternate cop
history and cop politics.</i>
<i>Cop dynasties, cop
heroes and evil doers.</i>
<i>Saintly cops and psycho cops.</i>
<i>Cops too stupid to live and cops
too smart for their own good.</i>
<i>Insulated by secret loyalties
and codes of silence</i>
<i>from the world they'd all
been given the control.</i>
<i>BigFoot's native element.</i>
<i>The air he breathed, the big
time he'd been so crazy</i>
<i>to get away from the beach
and be promoted into.</i>
<i>Then why so grumpy, BigFoot?</i>
<i>Doc remembered, dimly, a
story from long past.</i>
<i>A rumor about a partner
of BigFoot's who's been</i>
<i>shot and killed a while
back in the line of duty.</i>
<i>And ever since then, the story
went, BigFoot had worked alone.</i>
I hope this won't be another
one of those unabridged,
paranoid, hippie monologues you
seem obliged to sit through.
So what if someone dies
but is resurrected?
Not at first glance a
matter for Homicide.
So who around here
handles resurrections?
Bunkus Squad, usually.
Does that mean the L.A
PD believes that every
return from the dead
is some kinda con?
Look, you're you're dead.
We're talking philosophy?
That there is Coy Harlingen,
the stiff in question?
That was taken last night.
Remind me why I
give a shit again?
He worked for the
department as a snitch.
Not the mention for some patriotic bad
asses known as Vigilant California?
Who knows, they may or may
not've been on the raid at
Channel View Estates. You
remember that raid BigFoot?
All right.
All right I'll look
into it personally.
Sometimes it's just about
doing the right thing.
Who are you?
Clancy Sharlock
Glenn Sharlock's sister.
Sister...
I'm so sorry about
your brother.
Glenn was a shit, bound to have
his series canceled sometime.
That don't keep me from wanting
to know who his killer is.
Did you talk to the police?
They talked to me. Some
smart ass named BigFoot.
He seemed less concerned
with Glenn's murder
than Mickey Wolfmann's
disappearance.
But he's a fan of
yours all right.
He said you might
be able to help?
Did he now?
Did you hear that Wolfmann is working
on a way to give away all his money?
Why does he wanna do that?
He was on a guilt trip man.
Doing tons of acid
and peyote and...
Just got to a point.
He felt bad about making people pay for
all those cheap ugly houses of his.
You gonna keep holding to that
thing or are you gonna marry it?
He wanted to build this
big place out in the
desert where people could
come and live for free.
Called Arrepentimiento.
What's
that mean again?
It's Spanish for
'Sorry About That'
Do you think that maybe
your brother was just.
You know, doing his job
trying to prevent.
You know, who ever it was who was
putting the snatch on Mickey?
That's way too
fuckin' sentimental.
Sounds like somebody objected
to Mickey's big give away.
Wife? Business partners?
Puck Beaverton.
He had the duty that
day to guard Mickey.
Changed shift with Glenn
at the last minute.
Puck Beaverton...
interesting fellow I hear.
He's a major league ass hole.
So you dated.
-Him, and his roommate.
Two at a time?
That's my preference.
Well...
You know were I might be
able this Puck fellow?
Dropped out of sight
after Glenn's murder.
Set sail.
Set sail? like on a boat?
I don't know, maybe.
If you find him,
you'll let me know?
Well, perhaps we should continue
this conversacion somewhere else.
I've got a date.
and miss Charlock, I just need
a contact information from you
Hey Clancy.
Did Glenn ever mention
one of Mickey's ladies?
A girl by the name of Shasta?
The girl that's gone missing?
-That's her.
She was in love with him.
Deeply in love.
Shasta and Doc lived
together for a short while.
Bummer.
Well, ask someone who's been
down this particular exit ramp.
You can only cruise the
boulevards of regret so far.
Then you gotta get back
up on the freeway again.
Good luck.
See ya.
-Bye now.
<i>I wish you could
see these waves.</i>
<i>It's one more of these places a voice from
somewhere else tells you you have to be.</i>
<i>Remember that day
with the ouija board?</i>
<i>I miss those days.
And I miss you.</i>
<i>Nothing was supposed to
happen this way Doc.</i>
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>
<i>You don't remember the
ouija board, do you Doc?</i>
<i>It has been one of those
prolonged times with no dope.</i>
You think it knows
where we can score?
Ask. Just do it by
your self like that.
<i>Nobody had any. Everybody was desperate
and suffering lapses of judgment.</i>
3, 4, 2, 9...
It's a phone number!
It's ringing.
<i>Howdy dopers, we've got
what ever you need.</i>
<i>And remember, the sooner you get over
here the more there will left for you.</i>
<i>So come on down to 72723 Sunset
Boulevard. You better hurry.</i>
Sorry, okay. Who is this I'm talking to?
She hung up.
She's screaming at you: stay
away. I'm a police trap.
That's the problem
with ouija boards.
<i>That board sure did it's work.</i>
<i>They didn't score any
dope that day but</i>
<i>Somehow suddenly
it didn't matter.</i>
<i>It was weird that in the
limited space of a post card.</i>
<i>Shasta should've chosen to remember
that one day in the rain.</i>
<i>It had stuck with Doc too.</i>
<i>Even though it was late
in their time together.</i>
<i>When she was already
half way out the door.</i>
Hey Denis.
Denis I'm gonna go
look around, you wanna
wait in the car or come
in to cover my back?
I was gonna go try to
find a pizza is that OK?
All right, now you recall this is
stick-shift, not automatic and so forth?
It's easy as pie Doc.
After noon.
This is the address that gave me at
Club Asiatique, in San Pedro?
Just here to pick up a
package for management.
Hello, this is Sandra from front desk,
we have a pick up for management
Follow me.
Dr. Blatnoyd will see
you in a moment.
So you have some I.D, I imagine.
I don't know what this is...
What is it?
It's Oriental or something...
is it Chinese?
I figured
you being Chinese.
What? What are you
talking about?
The Golden Fang?
It's a syndicate.
Most of us happen
to be dentists.
A syndicate of dentists, set
up long ago for tax purposes.
All legit.
Where did you tell
Sandra you're from again?
Why you're another one of those
hippie dope fiends aren't you.
My goodness, my goodness me.
You're here of a little
perking-up aren't we?
It's from Darmstadt lab quality.
I try not to do any dope I
can't pay for, that's what it is.
No. On the house.
In fact maybe I can even join you for
one little moment.
Just to be sociable.
Doctor, I think there's a problem
with the couch in your office,
and bring that bottle.
<i>What do you think
of my chompers?</i>
<i>Heroin sucks the calcium out
of your body like a vampire.</i>
<i>You could use it for any length of
time, your teeth will go to hell.</i>
<i>And that's just the good part.</i>
Doc.
Doc.
Dr. Rudy, I'm back!
You're not Dr. Rudy.
You're not Dr. Rudy.
That's that Japonica, aint't?
Japonica Fenway?
Imagine meeting you here.
<i>Doc rooted through the city
dump that was his memory.</i>
<i>Recalling that Japonica
here had been a</i>
<i>pretty open and shut run
away daughter case.</i>
<i>Hardly worth daily scale.</i>
<i>Let alone the extravagant bonus
her father Crocker Fenway.</i>
<i>Had insisted on paying when Doc
finally brought Japonica back home.</i>
So what've you been up to?
Escaping mostly.
And I escape real good.
Escaping what?
Chryskylodon, this like booby hatch
my parents keep sending me too.
Booby hatch? Up in Ojai?
-You know it?
Shakes a tambourine.
Dr. Rudy.
OK, all right.
Japonica you promised me.
Did you not promise me?
What are you doing here?
-I escaped again for you.
Look at the greedy little
hippie snorting away are ya?
Your parents know you're here?
-No.
<i>The Fenways, they were heavy
duty South Bay money</i>
<i>And led lives of unusually high
density and often incoherence.</i>
<i>Her father Crocker, also known as
the dark prince of Palace Fairdays,</i>
<i>was a lead lawyer at the
office Forheath Kruger.</i>
<i>Who had given Doc his
first paying gig as a P.I.</i>
Man, like, I'm sorry.
Denis. What is? That's
my steering wheel?
I don't know how to drive.
I though you said you...
Hey.
Smile maintenance
chick, how lovely!
Miss Fenway may appear a
little psychotic today.
Groovy!
What?
It's groovy being insane man.
Where you at?
It's not groovy to be insane.
Japonica here has been
institutionalized for it.
OK, come now Denis, we gotta
figure a way back to the beach.
Hey if you need a ride
I'm heading that way.
Cop friendly? everything
cool with your ride Japonica?
Break lights, license plate'n so forth?
-Yeah.
OK.
Mind if I tag along with you guys?
Contingencies of the road and so forth?
That's a good idea maybe we can
just do a bit more of that for the road?
Yes. You want some?
What's in that bag you're
stuffing under Doc's seat?
Pay no attention to that bag.
You're gonna make
everybody paranoid.
<i>Though he may have
rescued Japonica from a</i>
<i>life of dark and unspecified
hippie horror.</i>
<i>Apparently restoration to the bosom
of her family had been enough.</i>
<i>To really drive her
around the bend.</i>
Fuck. Fuck it!
Easy.
Fuck! I can't. Okay
we are so fucked. I got so many.
Are you the Great Beast?
-No, no, that's policeman!
You know you're driving
without your headlights ma'm?
But I can see in the dark.
Perhaps you shouldn't
be driving then.
I'm gonna need to see
all of you IDs please?
And what is this all about sir?
Any gathering of three or more civilians
is now considered a possible cult.
What? It's Charlie Manson again?
Criteria includes reference
to the book of revelation.
Males with shoulder-length
hair or longer.
And endangerment through
inattentive driving.
All of which, all of you
have been exhibiting.
I don't think so!
Man, listen, this is a Mercedes. It's
only painted one color.
You all hang tight.
That should count for something...
-Good point!
I actually gonna have
a heart attack, actually
my heart is racing like
a little boom boom
Yes, sir.
I'm gonna hand these in Mr.
Sportello and as long as
there isn't any wants or
warrants I don't know about.
I don't wanna hear
any more about this.
Thank you officer, you
have a good night.
Thank you sir, drive safely.
Idiots Unlimited?
Yeah, I'm in an evil
mood myself tonight.
Dr. Rudy Blatnoyd, D.D.S.
has perpetrated his last
root canal, I'm afraid.
Habla ingles man. What's
that he's dead?
We found him next to a trampoline in
Bel Air, with a fatal neck injury.
So far no witnesses, no
motives, no suspects.
Apart from you.
Not me. Why me?
You were observed in
Blatnoyd's company,
both of you were riding in a vehicle
full of drug crazed hippies.
<i>Yeah, well, you know.</i>
The owner of that vehicle.
Is a very well respected
lawyer down at Palos Verdes.
And his daughter was
driving she offered me a ride.
And you know the cops
didn't even give her a ticket.
<i>And you know Blatnoyd was
her friend not mine.</i>
Go to bed.
I'm working, why do you
want me to go to bed?
I think it's time we
had one of our chats.
So on this Coy
Harlingen matter.
On the face of it
Just one more O.D, one
last junkie, case cleared.
And on the not face of it?
Why, what do we have here.
Why don't you pick
a card, any card.
These are field
interrogation reports.
See if you find anything
that looks familiar.
Card tricks
Puck Beaverton!
Excellent choice. One of
Mickey Wolfmann's bodyguards.
Interesting fellow I here.
Sherif's people happen to run into him
at the Venice home of the very dealer
that sold Coy Harlingen the smack
that killed him or didn't kill him.
What was Puck doing
in Coy's dealer's place?
The interesting thing.
About this overdose.
Is that Leonard James
Loose-meat, aka EI Drano.
Was know for the street
percent product.
Yet the report says what killed him
was pure China white number four.
You mean like from the whole seller,
like who ever is bringing it in?
I seem to recall
some years ago.
Jus before I went into Folsome.
Beaverton used to work
for this loan shark.
Adrian Prussia.
Fucking zoiks, I know
Adrian Prussia!
Yeah I know him from my
skip-tracing days, he's a bad man.
With a baseball bat, sick.
And Coy's dealer, EI Drano, also happens
to be Prussia's steady customer.
So maybe Puck was there
in Adrian's behalf.
What do you think?
I think you and Adrian have a
history you're not sharing with me.
Pancakes aren't quite as
good as my mother's.
But what I really go for here
is the respect.
You didn't get enough
of that from your mom.
You probably imagine, that I have a lot
of status up in robbery-homicide.
I mean who can blame you
for thinking that.
The reality, however.
No Cielo Drive for BigFoot.
No TV movie rights or
book deals for BigFoot.
I mean even the extra
work is drying out.
God help us all.
Dentists on trampolines.
Your Dr. Blatnoyd, had
puncture wounds on his throat.
Consistent with bites from canines
of a mid-sized wild animal.
That's what the coroner
told me swallow that.
Listen, that's, that's
mighty weird BigFoot.
OK? because Blatnoyd was
a partner in a tax dodge.
called itself The Golden
Fang Enterprises.
Now you didn't happen
to get the SID to test
those neck punctures
for gold or nothing?
I shouldn't think
there'd be much trace.
Gold is all but
chemically inactive.
As you might've learned
in chemistry class.
If you hadn't been ditching all the
time to score dope Sportello.
Every contact leaves traces.
It would sure be ironic man,
that's all I'm saying.
If it turns out that Blatnoyd was
bit to death by a golden fang.
Or better yet, like even
better, like two golden fangs.
I don't see why any of
this would be material.
Cause it's the
fuckin Golden Fang.
If it's the decedent's
tax shelter, so what?
No, man, it's not a tax
shelter, it's something...
BigFoot man, much
more, more vast.
This wouldn't be just more of your
paranoid hippie bullshit would it?
Look, have the lab check
for traces of copper.
Not the kind that goes stumbling all over
a crime scene contaminating evidence.
We want Copper the
metal, you see.
Gold teeth are never
made with pure gold.
Dentists like to
alloy it with Copper.
Now if you hadn't ditched forensics
class to go steal hubcaps.
To plant on some
innocent hippie.
You might've known that.
You feel like a cop
almost, don't you.
Good Day.
So where to?
A place up in Ojai
called Chryskylodon?
Chryskylodon, animal tooth.
Ancient Indian word,
Sortilege, means serenity.
I'm a nerd in the classics! it's
not Indian, it's ancient Greek.
It means animal tooth
made out of gold.
You're doing good Doc.
Thanks Lege.
<i>Owing to governor Reagan's shut down of

Mr. Sportello.
Dr. Albrie Threeply.
How do you do?
So good to see you sir
-Good to see you.
Welcome.
Would you...? Sorry. Would you
like to use the facilities?
You already used the bathroom?
Hit the bathroom before you
take a tour of the facilities?
This is my colleague Dr.
Lily Hammer.
How do you do?
-Mr. Sportello
Please join us.
This is our
administrative lounge.
Our Chenin Blanc comes from
the institutes own vineyard.
Hands steady as rock
today I see, Kimberly.
So happy you noticed Dr.
Threeply.
More soup Dr. Hemard -Yes, if
you know what's good for you.
Have you been with us before Mr.
Sportello?
I know I've seen your face.
First time I've
been down here.
Normally I don't get
much south of south city
And abnormally?
What?
Well I only meant that with any number of
qualified facilities in the Bay Area.
Why would you bother coming
all the way down here to us?
My clients believe that
Ojai is a planetary chakra?

Any questions?
Is that a swastika
on that man't face?
No it isn't it.
That's an ancient Hindu
symbol, meaning all is well.
It brings good fortune,
luck, and well being.
What do you mean?
I mean it looks like
a swastika to me.
Well, he isn't a regular
employee of the Institute.
Perhaps you should pay no
attention to that man.
Encapsulated in the
charming phrase Japanese.
which means, of course,
'you must be very tired'.
Which brings us to the
Institute's own zen garden.
Imported from Kyoto.
But each textured pebble, each.
Grain of white sand.
Was transported and reassembled
here exactly in place.
By a team of some of our
more obsessive patients.
Mickey.
Mickey.
Mickey!
Hello little hippie.
How are you?
What are you doing here?
They are helping me.
They're helping me wake up
from my bad hippie dream.
What did you dream about?
I dreamed. I gave
away all my money.
Yeah.
Who brought you here?
My friends.
Who are your friends? The FBI?
I spent my whole life...
I spent my whole life making
people pay for shelter.
And all along, I
didn't realize...
I didn't realize it was
supposed to be for free.
For free.
Where's Shasta?
Tell me, did she come with you?
Is she here?
Mickey, where the
fuck is Shasta?
Go away little hippie.
Go away.
New casino.
Hotel, 25000 square feet.
9 dining places.
<i>We don't have much to go on.
Just a broadcast Baret put out.</i>
<i>He was ambushed by
two male negroes.</i>
<i>Possibly on foot.</i>
<i>He thinks he wounded both of
them, but we can't be sure.</i>
<i>As far as I know we have
two units code 100.</i>
<i>One on Manchester...</i>
BigFoot, you're adorable.
Hi Shasta!
Hi Doc.
Either I'm on
a time machine.
Or you're back.
I've been away.
Where've you been?
Up north, family stuff.
Anything been
happening down here?
Your friend in the a
construction business?
It's all over.
He's back with Sloane and
the kids and so what?
You know you got a load of people
out looking for you Shasta.
Well here I am. C'est la vie.
C'est la vie.
Que se'fuckin sera, sera.
Something like that.
I like your necklace.
It can't be good.
Got word that your
girl is back in town.
<i>Yeah? Well
that's news to me.</i>
Where you've been?
No place I'd recommend.
<i>Any developments on the
Coy Harlingen matter?</i>
I could give a shit.
Any of them include Prussia?
Or Beaverton, or any of the mother
fuckers that I've given you?
All right, forget that, listen.
Any results on those fang marks?
You know, coroner's people
got very upset with
me for suggesting more
lab work, you know that?
Well...
I just thought it'd be a helpful
tip to a fellow professional.
Yeah, well how is
that Sportello?
Yeah, when your
own hearing comes up?
What are you suggesting?
One county supervisor
with a bug up his ass.
Is all it takes to bring
you down BigFoot.
This is Mrs. Chastity Bjornsen, and
if that is one more sociopathic.
Special employee of my
husband, I will thank
you to stop harassing
him on his day off
It's Sportello.
-Sportello! Doc Sportello.
The Doc Sportello so we
meet at last.
Mr. moral fucking
turpitude himself?
Have you any idea of the
therapist bills around
here for which you are
directly responsible?
The Department picks up just a little.
-The Department?
Yeah after a deductible that
would choke a fuckin horse.
You know he called me.
<i>I don't understand your spineless
response to that dirty,</i>
<i>hippie, piece of shit.</i>
<i>Would you get the fuck up.</i>
Get the fuck up Christian.
Christian get the fuck up,
now Christian please.
And would you stop acting
like a beaten dog,
I ask you for one
fuckin day a week.
What kind of girl
do you need Doc?
Maybe a thing from one
of those Manson chicks?
Well...
The thing is that,
depends on what you sure
you wanna be doing that?
Submissive, brainwashed,
horny little teeners.
Who'd do exactly
what you want.
Before you even
know what that is?
You don't have to say
a word out loud.
They get it all by ESP.
Your kind of chick Doc?
You're the one that's been
stealing my magazines?
What would Charlie do?
Well...
Probably not this.
Listen.
I'm sorry about Mickey.
-Mickey.
Mickey could've taught all you
swinging beach bums a thing or two.
He was just so powerful.
Sometimes he could almost
make you feel invisible.
Fast.
Brutal.
Not what you'd call a
considerate lover...
but we adored it about him.
Me.
and Sloane and Luz.
So nice to be made to feel
invisible that way sometimes.
And guys just love to
hear shit like this.
He'd bring me to lunch
in Beverly Hills.
One big hand wrapped around my
bare arm steering me blind.
Down those bright streets into some
space where it's dark and cool.
You couldn't smell any
food, only alcohol.
Tables full of them.
They'd all be drinking.
In a room that could've
been any size
and they all new Mickey.
They wanted, some of them,
to be Mickey.
He might as well've been
bringing me in on a leash.
He kept me in those
micro-mini dresses.
Never allowing me to wear
anything underneath.
Just offering me up to
whoever wanted to.
Stare.
Grab.
Sometimes,
He'd fix me up with
some of his friends.
And I have to do
whatever they wanted.
Why are you telling me all this?
I'm sorry Doc.
You want me to stop?
If my girlfriend had run off to
be the bought and sold whore.
Of some scumbag developer?
I'd be so angry I don't
know what I'd do.
Well.
I'm even lying about that,
I know what I'd do.
If I had the faithless little
bitch over my lap like this...
This doesn't mean
we're back together.
Of course not.
You didn't get
this necklace up north?
I went on a boat ride.
A three hour tour?
They told me I was.
Precious cargo that
couldn't be insured.
Because of inherent vice.
What's that?
I don't know.
<i>Inherent Vice.</i>
<i>In a marine insurance policy.</i>
<i>Is anything that
you can't avoid.</i>
<i>Eggs break, chocolate melts,
glass shatters.</i>
<i>And Doc wondered what that meant
when it applied to ex old ladies.</i>
What's on your mind Doc?
Besides the usual?
I'm like, you know...
Working my salad of
a brain crazy lege.
Well.
Put it in another way.
What's gonna nag at you in
the middle of the night?
Little-kid blues.
saxophone blues.
You know, whatever.
I meant to do, Coy you
know, mistakes aside.
Nobody deserves to go through life
without seeing their daughter.
That don't sit well with me.
Then go get 'em.
What are you doing here?
Wanted to see if you're
free for dinner.
Didn't mean to freak you out.
Are you all right?
Am I?
Are you?
Should I call security?
I don't think we need.
This is the one I've
been telling you about.
Yeah?
You know who of your pals
had Mickey Wolfmann?
What?
The FBI? I mean we suspected
but we couldn't prove it.
Well, I saw him
in their custody.
You saw him?
-Yeah
Would you be willing
to let me depone you?
Sure would.
-You would?
What is it?
You, me, a tape machine, maybe
another DDA to witness it?
All right listen, I need
something from you though?
What?
I need to look up
somebody's jacket.
That's it?
That's no big deal, we
do that all the time.
What? you break into officially
sealed records all the time?
Grow up, what's the
name on the file?
Adrian Prussia.
<i>As if looking for something
he didn't want to find.</i>
<i>It became clear as Vodka
you keep in the ice box.</i>
<i>That whatever the connection</i>
<i>between the LAPD and
Adrian Prussia.</i>
<i>He might as well have been working
for them as a contract killer.</i>
<i>Doing deeds for them they
couldn't do for themselves.</i>
<i>Time after time he
was pulled in</i>
<i>Questioned, arraigned,
indicted, no matter.</i>
<i>Somehow the cases never
quite got to trial.</i>
<i>Each being bargained down in
the interests of justice.</i>
<i>Not to mention Adrian,
who invariably walked.</i>
<i>And one of those deeds
appeared to be labeled:</i>
<i>The Justifiable Homicide</i>
<i>of one of the LAPD's very own.</i>
<i>Vincent Intellicado.</i>
<i>otherwise known as
BigFoot's partner.</i>
BigFoot?
<i>BigFoot's partner?
Fuckin BigFoot's partner?</i>
<i>BigFoot's air of
possessed melancholy.</i>
<i>Now began to make sense.</i>
<i>This was mourning all right.</i>
<i>And it was deep.</i>
Is this your new
partner BigFoot?
Want a banana Adrian?
Bend over and I'll
stick it in for you.
Fuck you, and fuck your banana.
<i>Man, oh man...</i>
<i>Never be surprised
at the levels</i>
<i>Of disrespect within the LAPD.</i>
<i>But this was down right nasty</i>
<i>Not to mention unprofessional.</i>
<i>This bond between partner</i>
<i>Was nearly the only thing Doc had
ever found to admire about the LAPD.</i>
You know there's places
you don't wanna go Doc.
Go back to the beach.
You smell like a patchouli fart.
<i>So here is Doc.</i>
<i>Midnight.</i>
<i>Pitch dark.</i>
<i>Can't remember whether they'd
drained the pool or not.</i>
<i>But hey, what the
fuck does it matter?</i>
<i>He bounced once.</i>
<i>Twice.</i>
<i>And then off the
end of the board</i>
<i>In a blind cannonball down into
old karma with Adrian Prussia.</i>
<i>Who had not only
shot at him once</i>
<i>But threatened him with a Carl
Yestremsky special baseball bat.</i>
<i>All this.</i>
<i>Leaving Doc to wonder,</i>
<i>where's the partner
to watch my back?</i>
Far out man.
Right, psychedelic, done.
So...
You're here about?
Good question.
Wait a minute, this
is bullshit.
I remember you.
You're that kid from Fritz's
shop up in Santa Monica right?
So what're you up to these days?
Skip-tracing?
Or did you go into
the priesthood?
P.I
They gave you a license?
So who sent you here?
Who you're working for today?
All on spec...
on my own time.
Wrong answer.
How much of your own time,
do you think you got left kid?
I was just about to ask.
Howdy. Puck?
Do I know you?
I don't think I do.
You must remind me of
someone I ran into someplace,
my mistake.
I, have a busy day ahead.
And I know nothing.
Of any of this.
What are you doing here?
Just talking to Adrian.
These various cases I'm working on.
And...
Glenn Charlock.
And Vincent Intellicado
And...
Where...
Did you...
Your necklace is...
It looks funny on you.
Big man, small necklace.
Acid, invites you
through a door
PCP opens that door,
Shows you through it,
Slams the door behind you,
And locks it.
Special treat for
you today doper,
Just got in a shipment
of pure number four.
Ain't a white guy's
finger laid on it.
Between the Golden
Triangle and
Your own throbbing vein.
Just let me step out
and I'll go get you some.
Don't go away now.
Puck!
Pucky!
Did I get you?
BigFoot?
What the fuck?
Did you take care
of them okay Doc?
You fuckin lunatic,
what is this?
I'm in enough shit personally
with the Captain.
And I've seen you on
the range, nice work.
Is that what I think it is?
Just one of the two of them.
There's more than enough
left for evidence.
Man, BigFoot. I saw the movie.
As I recall that character
comes to a bad end.
Put the gun away Doc.
What?
-The gun, put it away.
This is The Golden Fang you'r
about to rip off man.
The fully fuckin weird
outfit that kills people.
That's according to your own
delusional system, get in the car.
Get in the car.
Where are we going?
We had to impound
your car again.
It was parked illegally.
<i>Dopers' ESP Doc, dopers' ESP.</i>
<i>BigFoot you
mother fucker.</i>
<i>OK Doc, you have what looks
to be a 20 kilo inconvenience</i>
<i>in your trunk</i>
<i>And BigFoot no doubt putting
out word to that effect.</i>
<i>And once again, you're the bait.</i>
Hello?
<i>It sure been a long time.</i>
And, your name was?
<i>This is Crocker Fenway.</i>
Japonica's dad?
What happened this time?
<i>You have something that belongs
to some people I represent.</i>
<i>And they would like it back.</i>
So you're a
principal of all this?
<i>It's only because of me and
our small transaction.</i>
<i>Over Japonica that
you're still alive.</i>
Ever so grateful sir.
So what do we do?
Suppose someone wants
their back?
<i>Why don't we meet this
evening at 6 o'clock.</i>
<i>At my club The Portola,
in Elysian Park?</i>
Is there is a dress code?
<i>Jacket and tie if possible.</i>
I'll see you then.
Mr. Sportello?
Mr. Fenway.
To a peaceful resolution.
How is the family?
Japonica is doing fine
if that's what you mean?
You know I...
I think I saw Japonica the other
day at my doctor's office.
You ever run across a dentist
named Rudy Blatnoyd?
The son of a bitch who until
recently was corrupting my daughter?
Yes I...
Do seem to recall the name.
He perished in a
Trampoline accident. Didn't he?
The LAPD aren't so sure
it was an accident.
And you'd like to
know if I did it?
What possible motive
would I have?
Just because the
man preyed on a,
An emotionally vulnerable child?
Forced her to engage
in sexual practices.
That might appall even
sophisticate like yourself?
Does that mean I'd have any
reason to see his miserable.
Pedophile career come to an end?
What a vindictive person you
must imagine me.
I did suspect he was fucking
his receptionist but
What dentist doesn't?
It's some oath they all
take in dentist school.
Anyhow it's a Long way from strange
and weird sex. Isn't it?
What about when he forced my
little girl to listen to.
Original cast albums of Broadway
musicals while he had his way with her?
Or the
Tastelessness of,
the decor of.
Resort hotel rooms.
He took her to during
endodontist conventions?
The wallpaper, the lamps.
Japonica is of legal
age now, isn't she?
In their fathers' eye
they're always too young.
To the matter at hand.
Those I represent.
Are prepared to offer you a
generous compensation package.
For the safe return
of their property.
Suppose it didn't have to
be in the form of money?
Well, money would
be a lot easier.
There's a saxophone player
named Coy Harlingen.
He's been working undercover.
For different anti-subversive
outfits including the LAPD.
He's, come to feel lately that he
made the wrong career choice.
Lost all his family,
his freedom.
Like you, he only
has one daughter.
Please.
Okay, well, he wants out.
I think I can square
with the heat.
There's this other
bunch Vigilant California.
And, well, whoever is
running them of course.
My guess is, they prefer he not
disclose any confidential information
I'll see he never do.
Your personal guarantee?
I'll go after him myself
if he tries anything.
Then we have a deal.
That's all you wanted?
No, money now you sure?
Well how much would I have to take from
you so I wouldn't lose your respect?
It's a bit late for that,
Mr. Sportello.
People like you lose
all claim to respect.
The first time they
pay anybody rent.
I may not be as well connected.
For sure not as much into
revenge as folks are.
But if you jive with me my man.
I say to you.
So, where are we gonna
do this hand off?
Golden Fang operatives, 12
O'clock, fast approaching.
What's all this?
It's a credit card. Don't
hippies have them?
Yeah, I must've meant why is
you mother handing me this?
It's not for you.
You're supposed to tell him:
well done, welcome back to the
main herd, safe journeys.
That's journeys plural.
OK, I guess I can remember that.
What are you lookin at?
So, you guys been working
for The Golden Fang long?
Everything is cool, I'm officially
off everybody's payroll.
Burke Stodger just
called me personally.
You're a dangerous hombre.
You all right?
You know what the Indians say.
You saved my life, now
you're responsible it.
No man, it's not true.
some hippie made that up man.
You saved your own life man,
now you get to live it.
<i>Yet there is no void in time.</i>
<i>The sea of time.</i>
<i>The sea of memory
and forgetfulness.</i>
<i>The years of promise
gone and unrecoverable.</i>
<i>Of the land almost almost allowed
to claim it's better destiny.</i>
<i>Only to have that claim jumped by
evil doers known all too well.</i>
<i>And taken, instead</i>
<i>And held hostage to the future
we must live in now, forever.</i>
So who got her?
The Department of Justice.
So like justice was served?
That's exactly right, Doc,
that's exactly right.
<i>May we trust this blessed ship</i>
<i>Was bound for some better shore?</i>
<i>Risen and redeemed.</i>
<i>Were the American fate</i>
<i>Mercifully failed to transpire.</i>
Don't get up.
BigFoot, man.
You smashed through
my door? Come on.
After a long and busy day of
civil rights violations.
I found myself in the neighborhood
and compelled to drop in.
Just to check and see the
current state of affairs
Of my old stomping grounds.
Seeing as your effort to keep
lines of communication.
Had been limited
to say the least.
Well... I've been busy.
Trying to figure out which side of the
Zigzag papers to stick your sign?
Give it to me.
Listen.
I'm sorry about last night.
You?
Why should you be sorry?
Weird.
Are you OK brother?
I'm not your brother.
Yeah but you could use a keeper.
<i>Remember that day?</i>
<i>Ouija board set us off
into that big star.</i>
This feels the
same way tonight.
Just us
together.
Almost like being under water.
The world.
Everything
gone some place else.
Just figured it was
Sortilege setting us up.
No, her ouija board and
she knows things Doc.
Maybe about us that
we don't know.
This don't mean we're
back together.
Of course not.
