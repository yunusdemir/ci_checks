at the first piece of debris...
...to wash ashore
from Volée Air Flight 180...
...which erupted shortly
after a 9:25 p.m. Takeoff...
...from John F. Kennedy Airport
in New York.
There are no known survivors.
However, Coast Guard
and Naval Search and Rescue efforts...
...are continuing at this moment even
as jet fuel burns on the ocean's surface.
Authorities are pessimistic
about the possibility...
...of finding anyone alive
from the ill-fated flight.
All 287 passengers are feared dead.
Amongst the travelers, a class of
40 students and four teachers...
...from Mount Abraham High School
in southeast New York...
...en route to Paris on a field trip.
There are reports that several students
were removed from the aircraft...
...moments before departure.
However, investigators remain guarded
about the specifics of this incident.
Authorities from the National
Transportation and Safety Board...
...and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation have arrived at JFK...
...to begin the initial investigation.
Eyewitnesses at the airport,
as well as on Long Island...
...report seeing the plane explode.
No other aircraft
were visibly near Flight 180.
At JFK, air traffic controllers
are corroborating...
...these eyewitness accounts.
After the explosion, debris apparently rained
into the Atlantic Ocean for several miles.
However, investigators are cautious
about verifying these accounts...
...believing they'll learn more from the
found debris when daylight arrives.

And so, before we can heal...

I've seen enough TV to know that the

They were there last night.
They don't have a clue...
...what caused the crash.
They haven't ruled out anything.
The fact that seven people got off
the plane is probably weird enough.
Not to mention that one of those people
had a vision, or whatever...
...of the plane exploding minutes before
it did explode, is highly suspicious.
And it doesn't help that the visionary's

Design?
Does that mean if you figure out
the design, you could cheat death?
Alex.
You've already done that
by walking off the plane.

...that death has a new design
for all of you.
Now, you have to figure out how
and when it's coming back at you.

But what if it was our time?

- The Dow down 75.
The National Transportation Safety Board
has a new theory tonight...
...on the possible cause of the
explosion of Volée Air Flight 180.
Officials believe
deterioration of silicon insulation...
...on an electrical connector
to the scavenger pump...
...may have leaked combustible fluids.
- A spark in the fuel switch...
- That's Tod's seat.
...in the fuselage may have ignited the
fuel line and proceeded to the fuel pump...
...which would have set off
the catastrophic explosion.
The path of the explosion.
Okay, the first was Tod.
Then it was Terry.

Get on the plane."

for what happened on the plane.
You guys are gonna sit on your little chairs

Then Terry Chaney,
while you were there at the scene.
And now tonight we pick you
up at Val Lewton's house.

When I was a kid, like 6 or 7...
...I used to worry so much
about my parents dying.
Lying awake at night just worrying.
Yeah, well, most kids do, I guess.
Most kids never have it happen.
When I was 10, my dad went into
a 7-Eleven for cigarettes.
I guess that he heard someone say,
"Don't turn around."
So on reflex, or thinking
it was a friend joking, he did.
And the guy blew his head off.
Life became shit after that.

have crossed the street to avoid this guy.
