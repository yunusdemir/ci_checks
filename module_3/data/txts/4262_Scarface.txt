ln May 1 980,
Fidel Castro opened the harbor
at Mariel, Cuba,
with the apparent intention
of letting some of his people
join their relatives
in the United States.
Within seventy-two hours,
3,000 U.S. boats
were headed for Cuba.
lt soon became evident
that Castro was forcing
the boat owners
to carry back with them
not only their relatives,
but the dregs
of his jails.
Of the 1 25,000 refugees
that landed in Florida,
an estimated 25,000
had criminal records.

Castro just sprung him.
This guy was one of
the top dogs for Fidel

Castro felt he
couldn't trust him
and threw him in jail.
But while he was on top,
he tortured a few guys
to death.
One of the guy's brothers
is a rich guy in Miami now.
He wants

That's where

of chicks' asses.
How's that?
That sounds
completely crazy to me.
Look at that. Look.
You're missing the sights.
That's what you're doing.
We're missing
the action.
(SPEAKlNG SPANlSH)
Want to have some ice cream
with my friend and me?
Get lost, greaseball !
Look at that.
lce cream?
That's right.
You said "ice cream"?
Girls like ice cream.
Oh, come on.
That won't work.
You can't
do it that way.
You know how
you pick up chicks
in this country?
What was that?
What you just did?
That's what you do.
That's disgusting.
Watch.
Look at that fucking thing.
You look like a lizard.
Like a bug coming
out of your mouth.
Figures you
wouldn't understand.
But the women
in this country,
when you do that,
they know.
They know what?
They understand.
They go crazy.
lt'll take practice,
but you gotta learn.
'Cause women love
when you suck the pussy.
Look at that.
(SPEAKlNG SPANlSH)
She's looking at us.
You think you
can do it with her?
l think l can.
TONY: You want to
try it with her?
MANNY: Why not?
You gonna watch me?
l'm looking at you.
Go ahead.
You won't do it.
Watch this.
l'm with you, man.
l'm gonna get her.
Go ahead, Romeo!
Do your thing.
Just be quiet.
Just hang back.
Romeo!
You're looking
very pretty today.
Yes, you.
l've been watching you.
You want to see
something funny?
Take a look over there.
See that man?
Watch that guy.
l gotta sit down here.
l gotta watch my friend.
He gonna stick his
tongue out to that girl.
Oh, look at that.
You're sick!
You see what
happened to him?
lf l wasn't
a nice guy. . .
She's too big for you.
Causing trouble
like that, come on.
Bitch ! Lesbian !
What l try to tell you?
What l try to tell you?
This country,
you gotta make
the money first.
Then when you
get the money,
you get the power.
Then when
you get the power,
then you get the women.
That's why you gotta
make your own moves.
MANNY: That's the one
l rented.
MANNY: That's the one
l rented.
No. That's her, man.
There she is.
About time.
Frank got held up
at the golf course.
He told me
to pick you up.
He said he'd meet us
at the track later.
He said to bet on lce Cream
in the first, by the way.
ln that thing?
You must be kidding.
What you talking about?
That's a Cadillac.
l wouldn't be
caught dead in that.
Oh, come on.
lt's got a few years,
but it's a cream puff.
lt looks like
somebody's nightmare.
So, you like
this better?
Yeah.
lt's like one of them
tigers from lndia.
Tigers, huh?
Tigers, no?
Crazy guy. Know what
he's been doing?
Dragging me to the zoo
to look at tigers.
He says he's
gonna buy one.
You do that
and you won't have
any friends left.
Not that you have
any now.
You're gonna like
that tiger, man.
You gonna drive around
with a tiger in your
passenger seat?
Maybe.
Some lady tiger.
How much?
43,000, fully equipped.
That all?
Machine-gun
turrets are extra.
He's a funny guy.
Come here, Manny.
Bulletproof this, okay?
And this here and here.
MANNY: Okay.
TONY: And the windows.
Get me a phone
with a scrambler.
A scrambler.
And a radio
with scanners
to pick up flying saucers,
stuff like that.
Don't forget
the fog lights.
Oh. ln case l get
caught in a swamp.
That's a good idea.
(HORN HONKlNG)
Get out of the way, lady!
l'm trying to drive here!
l thought you were
taking me to Frank.
We got an hour.
You hungry?
No, but l'm bored.
Well, that figures.
Check it out,
Manny, okay?
And pay the guy.
And you take a taxi.
Meet me at the track,
okay?
Good doing business
with you.
Mr. Montana.
Oh, God, man !
l wouldn't buy the car
if you didn't like it.
Planning on
driving the girls crazy,
aren't you, Tony?
Oh, yeah.
You know who?
What would Frank say?
l like Frank,
you know?
Only l like you better.
(SNlFFS)
You got some for me?
Sure.
Okay.
(SNlFFS)
Okay.
Don't get confused, Tony.
l don't fuck around
with the help.
You wanna play
that way with me,
l play with you.
Shit.
Would you kiss me
if l wear the hat?
No!
Playtime is over, okay?
(LAUGHS)
Okay.
Mama?
Antonio.
Long time.
No postcards
from jail, huh?
Gina.
Tony?
Look at you.
You're beautiful.
l didn't. . .
Mama, look at
those eyes, huh.
Look at that.
She looks like me.
(LAUGHS)
You know
the last time l saw you,
you was like that.
You looked
like a little boy.
Now look at you.
l got something
for you.
lt's no big deal.
Oh, Tony!
(SOBBlNG)
l never thought
l'd see you again,
you know?
You think they'd keep
a guy like me down?
Well, no.
You look so good.
Look, open that up.
Open it.
For me?
l think so.
lt's nothing much,
you know, nothing.
(EXCLAlMlNG)
See what's
written on the back?
GlNA: On the back? Aw.
Always.
"Always."
lt's beautiful, Tony!
Mama is still working
in the factory,
and l work part-time
in a beauty parlor.
l'm doing hair, Tony.
Do you remember
Hiram Gonzalez?
His father owned
that barbershop.
lt's his place.
Plus l go to
junior college.
Miami Dade.
ln two more years,
l get my cosmetology
license.
Then l'll be
making enough money. . .
Surprise!
All that's over,
starting today.
Why?
My kid sister
don't have to work
in no beauty parlor,
and Mama,
she don't have to
sew in no factory.
Your son made it, Mama.
He's a success.
That's why l didn't
come around before.
l want you to see
what a good boy
l've been.
Here's $1 ,000.
For you, Mama.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Who did you kill
for this, Antonio?
Mama.
l didn't kill nobody, Mama.
MAMA: No?
No.
What are you doing now?
Banks,
or is it still bodegas,
you and the others?
No! Things are
different now.
l'm working with
an anti-Castro group.
l'm an organizer now.
l get a lot of
political contributions.
Sure you do.
A gun sticking
in somebody's face
is how.
You know,
all we hear about
in the papers
is animals like you
and the killings.
lt's Cubans like you
who are giving a bad name
to our people,
people who come here,
work hard
and make a good name
for themselves.
People who send
their children
to school.
What are you saying?
That's your son. . .
Son? l wish l had one.
He's a bum.
No.
He was a bum then
and he's a bum now.
Who do you think
you are?
Mmm?
We haven't heard a word
from you in five years.
(SPEAKlNG SPANlSH)
You suddenly show up here,
throw some money around
and think you
can get my respect.
You think you can
buy me with jewelry?
You think you can
come into my house
with your hotshot clothes
and your jail manners
and make fun of us?
You don't know
what you're saying.
That's not the way
l am, Antonio!
That is not the way
l raised Gina to be!
You are not
going to destroy her.
l don't need
your money.
(THANKlNG lN SPANlSH)
l work for my living.
l don't want you
in this house anymore!
l don't want you
around Gina.
So come on.
Get out!
Okay.
Mama. . .
And take this lousy money
with you. lt stinks.
Tony.
Why do you have
to spoil it
for everybody, huh?
l'm sorry, Tony.
Okay, Mama.
No. Tony,
wait a minute!
Don't go, please!
Gina, stay here!
No, Mama.
He's no good. Gina!
Tony, wait, please!
l'm sorry.
l don't know.
Mama, ever since
Papa left, she's. . .
Forget Papa.
We never had one.
l know you did
some bad things
back then.
ln the Army,
l know you got
into some trouble.
The Communists,
they're always trying
to tell you what to do.
Mama doesn't
understand that.
l know.
l just. . .
l don't know.
l just want you to know
that l don't care.
lt doesn't matter
to me how long
you've been away,
five or ten years.
You're my blood, always.
l know.
Come on.
l want you to take this.
l gotta go back in.
No, Tony. Please.
You need this.
What will l tell her?
Take that.
You don't tell
her anything.
Don't tell her
l gave it to you,
but give her some
from time to time.
And listen,
you go out yourself.
Go ahead.
Go out, do some things.
Have some fun.
You gotta get
some fun out of life.
You gonna beat yourself
to death at 1 9?
A pussycat like you?
Come here.
l'll talk
to you again.
Okay.
Put that money away.
Don't let her see it.
l'll talk to her.
l'll talk to you.
Okay.
Let's go.
She's beautiful.
How come you. . .
Hey!
Stay away from her.
You hear?
She's not for you.
Okay.
(ENGlNE STARTlNG)
COCHABAMBA, BOLlVlA
COCHABAMBA, BOLlVlA
So, this and my
other factory,
l can guarantee production
of 200 kilos refined
every month of the year.
The problem is,
l have no steady market.
Basically,
what l'm looking for is
somebody in the States
who can share
the risk with me,
somebody
who can guarantee
to buy from me, say,
1 50 kilos a month.
Oh, that's a big
commitment, Mr. Sosa.
Something like that. . .
Too bad Frank's not here.
You should talk to him.
lt would've been
nice if he'd come.
He would like to come,
but with his trial
coming up,
it's hard to
leave the country.
So he sent
you instead?
Something like that.
We'll talk at my house,
shall we?
You got good stuff here.
Class-A shit.
This Lopez guarantees
to buy 1 50 kilos from me
every month
of the year.
He picks it up here.
l can sell it to him
for as little as
7,000 a key.
You can't do
better than that.
But then we got
to take the risk
of moving it.
We'll be cutting
out the Colombians.
Know what that means?
That means we have to
go to war with them.
We cut out the Colombians,
we take risks on both sides.
TONY: Why don't
we split the risk?
You guarantee
your delivery, say,
as far as Panama,
we take it from there.
Panama is risky.
lt costs me more.
Panama l can sell
for 1 3.5 a key.
1 3.5?
What, are you nuts?
1 3.5? We still
got to take that
shit to Florida.
Do you know what
that's like these days?
You got the Navy everywhere.
You got frogmen.
You got EC2s with
the satellite-tracking shit.
You got the fucking
Bell 209 assault choppers
up the ass.
We're losing one
out of every nine loads.
That's no duckwalk anymore,
let me tell you.
Forget about 1 3.5.
(PHONE RlNGlNG)
What do you suggest
that is reasonable?
Excuse me.
One moment.
What the fuck's
the matter with you?
Are you negotiating
for Frank Lopez?
Don't worry about it.
Take it easy.
l'm not worried about it.
You should worry about it.
lf he wants to make a deal,
it's up to him, not you.
We're doing this
one deal. That's it.
Fuck you.
How's that?
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
OMAR: You need to
open your eyes and
keep your mouth shut.
That's it.
Let it go at that.
TONY: Don't worry
about it.
Your head's in
the wrong place.
You must watch
out for yourself.
Why not talk to him?
You think he wants
to give you the money?
Shut the fuck up.
l'm doing
the talking here, not you.
You're here
to watch my back.
Watch my back.
Better than your front,
let me tell you.
That's easier to watch.
(lNAUDlBLE)
Close your mouth.
l can't wait to see
what Frank's gonna
react to this one.
Just shut up. l'm doing
the talking here.
SOSA: Now where were we?
Panama.
You're looking for
a partner, right?
Something like that.
Look, Mr. Sosa,
we're getting
ahead of ourselves.
l am down on
Frank's authority to buy
200 keys, that's it.
That's my limit.
l got no right.
Nobody got no right
to negotiate. . .
Let the man
finish, okay?
Let him propose
a proposition,
then we can talk more.
You got no
authority here.
l started you
in this business,
so shut the fuck up.
Frank is gonna love it.
That's up to Frank,
not you !
l'm sorry about this,
Mr. Sosa.
No, it is all right.
You're right.
Maybe you should
talk to Frank.
Well, good.
l don't think it's
something l want to do
on an overseas phone.
But as soon as
l get back to Miami,
l will talk to
Frank personally.
Good.
My associates
can escort you
to my chopper
to take you
to Santa Cruz.
l have a jet there.
You'll be in Miami
in five hours.
You'll be
back here tomorrow
in time for lunch.
Good.
(SPEAKlNG SPANlSH)
Good talking to you.
Why not leave
your friend here?
While you're gone,
he can tell me how
to run my business.
l think Frank
wants to see him.
No, that's okay.
You tell Frank
l'm keeping this guy
on ice for him.
(BOTH LAUGHlNG)
l guess so.
Let's finish
our lunch.
l have to hand it
to you, Mr. Sosa.
You got everything
a man could want.
l like you, Tony.
There is no lying
in you.
Unfortunately,
l don't feel the same
about the rest of
your organization.
(HELlCOPTER HOVERlNG)
What do you mean
by that, Mr. Sosa?
l'm talking
about Omar Suarez.
This garbage was recognized
by my associate at lunch
from several years ago
in New York.
He was an informer
for the police.
(GROANlNG)
(SCREAMlNG)
He put Vito Duval and
Nello and Gino Ramos
away for life.
So how do l know
you're not a chivato,
too, Tony?
Hey, Sosa.
Let's get this
straight now.
l've never
fucked anybody over who
didn't have it coming.
You got that?
All l have in this world
is my balls and my word.
l don't break them
for no one,
you understand?
That piece
of shit up there,
l never liked him,
l never trusted him.
For all l know,
he had me set up
and had my friend
Angel Fernandez killed.
But that's history.
l'm here, he's not.
You want to go on
with me, say it.
You don't,
then you make a move.
l think you speak
from the heart, Montana.
But l say to myself,
"This Lopez, your boss,
"he had chivatos
like that working
for him."
His judgment stinks.
So l think to myself,
"How many other mistakes
has this Lopez guy made?
"How can l trust
his organization?"
You tell me, Tony.
Frank is smart,
you know?
You can't blame him
for that animal.
lt's a crazy business
we're in, you know?
That could happen
to anyone, even you.
Why don't l go back
and talk to Frank
and work it out?
l'll fix things
between us.
You got my word on that.
l think you and me,
we can work
this thing out,
we do business together
a long time.
Just remember,
l'll only tell you
one time,
don't fuck me, Tony.
Don't you ever
try to fuck me.
FRANK: You what?
You made a deal
for fucking $1 8 million
without even
checking with me?
Are you crazy, Montana?
Are you crazy?
Coño. Take it easy.
Coño, my ass!
At 1 0.5 a key,
it's puro.
You can't lose money.
No way.
We make 75 million
on this deal.
75 million.
That is serious money.
What is Sosa
going to do
when l don't come up
with the first 5 million?
What is he going to do?
Will he send me a bill?
He'll send
a hit squad up here!
There'll be
a war in the street.
Relax! Take it easy.
l'm in tight with Sosa.
You short a couple of mil,
l go on the street for you.
l make a couple
of moves,
a mil here, a mil there,
you got it.
Okay?
You've been making moves
on your own?
l got ears, you know.
l hear things.
What do you hear
about Echevierra
and the Diaz brothers?
What about Gomez?
What'll he do
when you start
moving 2,000 keys. . .
Fuck Gaspar Gomez and
fuck the Diaz brothers!
Fuck them all !
l'll bury
those cockroaches!
What they ever do for us?
Look, Frank,
the time has come.
We gotta expand.
The whole operation.
Distribution.
New York, Chicago, LA.
We gotta set our own mark
and enforce it.
We gotta think big now.
Think big.
Like your friend Sosa.
Let me tell you
something about that
greaseball cocksucker.
He is a snake,
that's what he is.
You turn
your back on him,
he'll stick it in.
You don't trust
a guy like that.
You want me
to believe
Omar was a stoolie
because Sosa said so?
You bought that line?
Maybe l made a mistake
sending you down there.
Maybe you and Sosa
know something
l don't know.
Like what?
Like what?
You tell me,
"Like what."
You calling me
a liar, Frank?
That what you're
calling me?
Let's just say
l want things
to stay the way
they are for now.
You stall your deal
with Sosa.
Stall it?
Okay, boss.
Come on.
l am the boss.
Sure, you're the boss.
Hey, Tony.
Remember l told you
when you started,
the guys who last
in this business
are the guys
who fly straight,
low-key, quiet.
And the guys
who want it all,
chicas, champagne, flash,
they don't last.
You finished?
Can l go now?
Hi, there.
You just missed Frank.
Too bad.
Only l didn't
come to see Frank.
This is not the time
or the place, Tony.
Next time,
make an appointment.
That's okay.
l got something
important l want to
talk to you about.
So why don't we have
a couple of drinks,
act normal,
and just take it easy?
Come on.
l like Scotch.
Sure. Why not?
Okay.
l won't bite you.
We're all normal here.
l heard you and Frank
aren't working
together anymore.
That's right.
l think it's easier,
don't you?
Makes things easier.
Thank you.
Here's to
the land of opportunity.
For you, maybe.
You like kids?
Kids?
Kids. You know, kids.
Little kids.
Sure. Why not?
As long as
there's a nurse.
Good, 'cause
l like kids, too.
l like them. Boys, girls.
Don't matter to me.
Frank's gonna be
back any minute.
Come here.
Sit here.
l want to talk to you.
Sit down.
l'm not gonna bite you.
Okay, here's the story.
l come from the gutter.
l know that.
l got no education,
but that's okay.
l know the street,
and l'm making
all the right connections.
With the right woman,
there's no stopping me.
l could go
right to the top.
Anyway, what l got
to tell you is this,
l like you.
l liked you the first time
l laid eyes on you.
l said, "She's a tiger.
"She'll belong to me."
Anyway,
l want you
to marry me.
l want you
to be the mother
of my children.
Me? Marry you?
That's right.
(SlGHS)
What about Frank, Tony?
What will you do
about Frank?
Frank is not
gonna last, okay?
He's finished.
Just think
about it, okay?
l want you to
really think about it.
l'll go now.
Take care.
(MUSlC PLAYlNG)

She's just dancing.
Come on.

lt's just a disco.
Who's that guy

He's nobody.
He's harmless.
Works for Luco?
Yeah. Forget him.
(EXCLAlMS)
Hello, Tony.
You remember me?
Bernstein.
Mel Bernstein, right?
Chief Detective,
Narcotics.
That's right, yeah.
l think we should talk.
Talk? What are we
going to talk about?
l ain't killed nobody,
not lately.
No, not lately.
What about ancient history,
like Emilio Rebenga?
Or a bunch of
whacked-out lndians
at the Sun Ray Motel?
Whoever's giving you
your information
is taking you
for a long ride.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Tony, baby,
we gonna talk,
or am l gonna bust
your wiseass spic balls
here and now?
Keep your eye on her.
MANNY: l'll do that.
TONY: Okay.
My office.
Good.
The word on the street
is you're bringing
in a lot of yeyo.
That means you're
not a small-time
punk anymore,
you're public
property now.
Supreme Court says
that your privacy
can be invaded.
Okay. How much?
How much?
There's an answer
to that, too.
Here's how much.
Can you see it?
Big number.
Yeah !
That's on a monthly basis,
same thing every month.
You know
how this works?
No. You tell me.
We tell you who's
moving against you,
and we shake down
who you want shaken down.
Let's say that you got
a real problem
making a collection.
And then we step in
for you.
Got eight killers
with badges
working for me.
When they hit, it hurts.
Same thing
works the other way.
You feed me
a bust now and then.
Some cowboy
setting himself up
in business.
Small fry, you know?
We like snacks.
How do l know
you're the last cop
l'm gonna have to grease?
What about Fort Lauderdale?
Metro? DEA?
How do l know
what rock they're gonna
crawl out from under?
Well, that's not
my business, Tony.
We don't cross no lines.
You think l want
this conversation
going any farther
than this table?
My guys' got families.
They're legitimate cops.
l don't want to
see them embarrassed.
lf they're embarrassed,
they'll suffer.
lf they suffer,
they'll make you suffer.
(SPEAKlNG SPANlSH)
You understand
what l'm talking about?
Huh?
Thanks for the drink.
By the way,
l got a vacation
coming up.
l'm gonna take the wife
to London, England.
We've never been there.
So throw in a couple
of round-trip tickets,
first class.
You gotta smile more, Tony.
You gotta enjoy yourself.
Every day above ground
is a good day.
Hello.
Hello.
Yeah.
Now that's the idea.
Okay, Mel.
You think about
what l said?
About the kids?
You know,
you are really nuts.
l'm nuts about you.
Why don't you
find your own girl?
My own girl?
Yeah.
That's what l'm doing.
Go do it somewhere else.
Get lost.
Maybe l don't hear
so good sometimes.
You won't hear anything
if you go on like this.
Will you do something?
You're fucking right
l'm going to do something !
l'm giving you orders.
Blow!
Orders?
You giving me orders?
The only thing
in this world
that gives orders
is balls.
You got that?
Balls.
Let's go.

When you
gonna learn? Huh?
Looking good, honey.
Keep up the bad work.
That cocksucker.
What happened?
What happened?
He put that prick
Bernstein on me.
Who? Lopez did?
How do you know?
Who else knew
about Rebenga? Omar?
He's fertilizer.
He's letting me know
he's got weight on me.
l'll tell you what, man.
You know our little trip
we've been planning
to New York?
lt might be a good time.
Wait.

Damn you !
You think he's cute?
l saw him

My kid sister

None of my business?

You can't tell me

Don't push me.

Don't push me!
Get outta here!
Go outside.
You got some nerve, Tony!
You think you can

You can't

And if l want to fuck them,
then l'll fuck them !
Fucking, man !
Come on, man.
What the fuck you want?
You want something? Huh?
No. Don't touch me.
No.
We've got to

Another great night here

(DRUMS BEATlNG)
Okay. All right!

Is that coke in your bra,
or are you just
gIad to see me?
A IittIe bit of hope,
I'm sure, yes.
I'm in a good mood.
I was depressed when
I got up this morning.
I had a dry dream,
but l'm better now.
I do LaureI and Hardy
in Spanish, too.

That's the height

Mr. Babalu himself.
He had the same probIem
for 1 0 years.
"Lucy, don't come
down to the club."
He's your brother.
He loves you.
That's why he did it.
All right?
He cares about you.
To him, you're still
his little sister.
That's the problem.
He still treats me
like l'm a baby.
l'm 20 years old now.
l'm not anybody's baby.
You're so grown-up.
Come on, Gina.
Put yourself in
his place, okay?
Right now, you happen
to be the best thing
in his life,
the only thing
that's any good,
that's pure.
Of course
he doesn't want you mixing
with those people,
growing up
to be like him.
He has this
father thing for you.
Feels like
he has to protect you.
Protect me against what?
Against guys
like that asshole
you were
dancing with tonight.
l like Fernando.
He's a fun guy
and he's nice.
And he knows how
to treat a woman.
All right?
He knows how to
treat a woman?
Yes.
By taking her
to the toilet
to make out?
MC: You've been
a great audience.
MC: You've been
a great audience.
I got a speciaI

My Little League team,
the Little Lopezers,
they won
the division tonight.
That's great.
Congratulations.
What'd you do,

Jesus Christ.
Tony, what happened
to you?
They wanted to
spoil my $800 suit.
Who the fuck

Hitters. l don't know.
Somebody must've
brought them in.
l've never
seen them before.
Hello, Mel.
Got an answer
to this, too?
There always is, Tony.
l'll bet it was
the Diaz brothers.
They got a beef going back
to the Sun Ray thing.
Maybe you're right,

Anyway, l'm glad
you made it, Tony.
We'll return the favor
for you in spades.

You know what
a chazer is, Frank?
That's a pig

Neither do you, Frank.
Tony, why the fuck

So we had
a few differences,
no big deal.
l gave you your start.
l was the one who

l stayed loyal to you.
l made what l could

Never!
But you,

You're sitting in it.

We're doing 1 0 million,
1 5 million a month.
Come on.
That's serious money.
You bank boys
gotta come down a bit.
No way.
That's crazy.
We can't do that.
Then that's too bad.
What am l gonna do?
We're not
a wholesale operation.
We're a legitimate bank.
The more cash you give me,
the harder it is
for me to rinse.
That's a problem.
l didn't know.
The fact is,
l can't take any more
of your money
unless l raise
the rates on you.
You gonna raise the. . .
l gotta do it.
The lRS is coming. . .
Don't give me that shit!
Let's talk.
l'm talking.
l go low, you go high.
l know the game.
This is business talk.
Let me explain
something.
The lRS is
coming down heavy
on South Florida.
There was
a TlME magazine story
that didn't help.
There's a recession.
l got stockholders
l got to be
responsible for.
l got to do it, Tony.
You'll learn from him.
l got to go 1 0% on
the first 1 2 million
in denominations of 20.
l'll go 8%
on your $1 0 bills,
6% on your fives.
We'll go somewhere else.
That's it.
There's no place
else to go.
Fuck you, man !
Fuck you !
l'll fly the cash myself
to the Bahamas.
Once, maybe.
Then what?
You'll trust some monkey
in a Bahamian bank
with 20 million of
your hard-earned dollars?
Come on, Tony.
Don't be a schmuck.
Who else can you trust?
That's why you
pay us so much.
You trust us.
Huh?
Did you hear that guy?
You got to listen to him.
You'll learn something.
Stay with us.
You're a well-liked customer.
You're in good hands with us.
And l got to run.
l'm safe but poor.
How's married life
treating you?
Better than you are.
(LAUGHS)
Say hello to
the princess for me.
She's beautiful.
l'll see you.
Take care.
You, too.
That prick!
Fucking WASP whore.
Talking to me
like l'm some maricón
who came over on a boat.
(SNlFFS)
l tell you what.
We don't need that
smiling motherfucker.
We should talk to
this Jewish guy,
Seidelbaum, okay?
He's got his own exchange.
He charges 4% at the most.
And he's connected.
Fuck them.
Mob guys. Guineas.
l don't trust them.
Did you sweep
the house this month?
The cars?
Yeah, l told you about it.
The $5,000?
Look at that.
What?
That cable truck there.
Since when does
it take three days
to rig a cable?
What?
You been watching it
for three days?
The thing has been there
for three days.
What am l gonna do,
not look at it?
What, you think
it's cops, right?
l don't know.
Could be
the Diaz brothers,
coming to get me.
Maybe.
l'll check it out, okay?
You check it out.
Then we're gonna blow
that fucking truck
back to Colombia!
Come on.
We're not the only dopers
living on the block.
Okay? Remember that.
That truck could be
anybody and anything.
lt could be
a cable company. . .
You know something?
You got some
fucking attitude.
For someone
who's in charge
of my security. . .
Here are the keys
to the front door.
Go down there.
Give them the keys!
l'm just trying
to say something.
You're spending
a lot of money on
this counter-surveillance.
l don't give a fuck.
lt's 1 2% of our
adjusted gross.
1 2% isn't peanuts.
l don't give a fuck!
lt makes me
sleep good at night.
That's what counts.
Okay?
You worry about it.
l am worried about it.
l'm telling you.
We're getting sloppy.
Our thinking,
our fucking attitude,
you know?
We're not
fucking hungry anymore.
Miami's changing.
You can see it everywhere.
New construction.
New jobs.
Growth that's financed
by Florida Security Trust.
We've put your money
to work for 75 years,
buiIding a more
prosperous Miami.
Count on us
being here tomorrow.
TONY: That's because
for 75 years, you been
fucking everybody.
Somebody should
do something
about those whores.
l mean, charging me
1 0 points on my money.
They're getting
away with it.
Fuck, there's no
laws anymore.
Forget it.
Anything goes.
They been around
1 ,000 years.
They got all
the angles figured out.
You know
what capitalism is?
Getting fucked.
ELVlRA: True capitalist
if ever l met one.
Uh-oh.
Did you hear that?
How would you know,
bubblehead?
You ever do
nothing besides
get your hair fixed
and powder your nose?
Look at you.
You do too much
of that shit.
Nothing exceeds
like excess.
You should
know that, Tony.
l should know what?
What should l know?
Why do you have to
talk to me like that
all the time,
like l got to
know something?
Let me talk to you.
Listen.
What time is it?
This Seidelbaum. . .
6:55.
Okay.
l met with this
guy Seidelbaum. . .
The drug-reIated vioIence
that's pIagued
South Florida...
He's good for a laugh,
this guy.
With a small
Iaw-enforcement budget,
how can you put a dent
on an estimated
$1 00-billion-a-year business?
lt seems at times
aII you can do
is put your finger
in the dike and pray.
Put your fingers
in a dyke?
The only place
you can get your fingers
is in some dyke.
...not by outIawing
the substances,
but by IegaIizing
and taxing them.
These voices say
that will drive out
the organized crime eIement.
l am not one
of those voices.
l know that.
But you know why?
'Cause you got your head
up your culo, that's why.
That fucking guy,
he never tells the truth.
...spIendor of our city
at its best.
TONY: lt's those guys, man !
lt's the fucking bankers,
the politicians,
they're the ones that
wanna make coke illegal
so they can make
the fucking money
and then get
the fucking votes!
They fighting the bad guys.
They're the bad guys!
They fuck anything
and anyone.
Can't you stop saying
"fuck" all the time?
Can't you stop
talking about money?
lt's boring, Tony.
Where's this coming from?
Boring? What's boring?
You're boring.
Oh.
"Money."
That's all l hear
in this house.
Look at these pelicans fly.
Come on, pelicans!
Here it is.
Frank never
talked about money.
That's 'cause
he was so smart.

lf you don't trust me

who're you gonna trust?
Junior partner.
Bullshit, man.
Don't talk to me

Say, "Hi, honey."
That's pretty cute.
Look at that.
You jerk off

So dress warm.
SHEFFlELD: Give me

They're gonna

So, what am l

Five years.
You'll be out in three.
Maybe less,

Three fucking years!
For what?
Washing money?
The fucking country was

Can't be that bad.

What the fuck

No way. l been there.
Okay, look.
(CLEARS THROAT)
l give you $400,000 more.
Okay, now that's $800,000.
With that kind of money,
you can buy
the Supreme Court.
Tony, the law has to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt.
l'm an expert at
raising that doubt.
But when you got
1 .3 million
undeclared staring into
a videotape camera,
honey baby, it's hard
to convince a jury
you found it

l'm so glad
you could come

lt's okay.
How's Elvira?
Oh, great.

Nice to meet you.
How do you do,
Mr. Montana?
SOSA: Sit here, Tony.
Gentlemen.
l would like to
discuss something
that is of interest
to all of us here.
You have a problem, Tony.
We have a problem.
l think together
we can solve
all our problems.
We all know you
have tax troubles
in your country
and that you
may have to do
a little time.
We have friends
in Washington
that assure us
these troubles can
be taken care of.
You may have to
pay some back taxes,
a big fine,
but there will be
no prison.
Okay.
So what's
your problem, Alex?
l'll show you
my problem.
lNTERVlEWER: l've heard
about financiaI support
your government receives
from the drug industry
in Bolivia.
WeII, the irony of this
is that this money,
which is
in the billions,
is coming
from your country.
You are the major purchaser
of our nationaI product,
which is cocaine.
lNTERVlEWER: On one hand,
you're saying
the U.S. government
is spending miIIions
to eliminate
the fIow of drugs
onto our streets.
At the same time,
we are doing business
with the same government
that is fIooding
our streets with cocaine.
Let me show you a few
of the other characters
that are involved
in this tragic comedy.
My organization
just recentIy traced
a Iarge purchase
by this man.
This charming face here
belongs to General Cucombre.
He is the Minister of
the Defense of Bolivia,
my country.
And General Cucombre just
a coupIe months ago
bought a $1 2 million villa
on Lake Lucerne
in Switzerland.
Now, if Cucombre
is supposed to be
the Bolivian
Defense Minister,
what is he doing
living in Switzerland?
Guarding cash registers?
This man here,
Alejandro Sosa,
a very interesting character.
He's a weaIthy Iandowner,
educated in EngIand,
very good famiIy.
But this man is
the business brain
and drug overIord
of an empire
that stretches
across the Andes.
He's not your
ordinary drug deaIer.
lNTERVlEWER:
WeII, discussing it openIy...
(SWlTCHES OFF TV)
He's scheduled
for 60 Minutes next.
He is going on French,
British, ltalian,
Japanese television.
People everywhere
are starting to
listen to him.
lt's embarrassing, Tony.
That is our problem.
You remember Alberto,
don't you?
How could l forget him?
Alberto is an expert
in the disposal business.
He's going to help us
fix our problem.
But he doesn't
speak English.
He doesn't know
his way around
the States too well.
He needs a little help.
ls that a problem, Tony?
No problem.
Good.
So what's
the big mystery with
the Bolivian situation?
You gonna tell me
what happened
with Sosa, or what?
A lot of bullshit,
that's what happened.
Politics.
l want you to
stay down here
for a while.
Run things for me.
l gotta go to
New York next week.
Fuck this, man.
l don't like it, man.
l don't like this at all.
You don't like it?
You got me
into this mess
in the first place.
With that fucking
Seidelbaum, that right?
With Seidelbaum?
What does Seidelbaum
have to do with Sosa?
How do you connect
those two?
Why don't you
eat your food?
What's wrong with it?
l'm not hungry.
You're not hungry?
Do you even know
about the trial?
What did you
order it for, then?
l lost my appetite.
Do you even know
that Sheffield said
he can get you
a postponement?
(SNlFFlNG)
ls this it?
That's what
it's all about?
Eating, drinking,
fucking, sucking. . .
Come on, man.
Snorting?
Then what?
Tell me. Then what?
You're 50.
You got a bag
for a belly.
You got tits,
you need a bra.
They got hair on them.
You got a liver,
and they got spots on it
and you're eating
this fucking shit
and you're looking like
these rich fucking
mummies in here.
Come on.
lt's not so bad.
lt could be worse.
ls this what
it's all about?
Forget it.
This what l work for?
Tell me.
Look at that.
A junkie.
l got a fucking
junkie for a wife.
She don't eat nothing.
Sleeps all day with
them black shades on.
Wakes up
with a Quaalude. . .
Don't pick on her, man.
. . .and who won't fuck me
'cause she's in a coma.
l can't even
have a kid with her.
Her womb
is so polluted,
l can't even have
a fucking little baby
with her!
You son of a bitch !
You fuck!
You shouldn't talk
like that.
How dare you talk
to me like that!
What makes you
so much better than me?
What do you do?
Don't worry.
You deal drugs
and you kill people.
Oh, that's wonderful, Tony.
Real contribution
to human history.
Go ahead.
Tell everybody.
You want a kid?
TONY: Tell the world.
What kind of a father
would you make?
(YELLlNG)
Gonna drive him to school
in the mornings?
Are you even gonna
be alive by the time
the kid goes to school?
You don't know
how to be a husband !
Sit down before l. . .
Do we ever go anywhere
without having 600 thugs
hanging around
all the time?
l have Nick "The Pig"
as a friend.
What kind of life
is that?
Can't you see
what we're becoming, Tony?
We're losers.
We're not winners,
we're losers.
Go home.
You're stoned.
l'm not stoned,
you're stoned.
Get her out of here.
Come on.
l'm not going home
with you.
l'm not going home
with anybody.
l'm going home alone.
l'm leaving you.
l don't need
this shit anymore.
Okay, but l'll
walk you out.
l'll take her home
in a cab.
Let her go.
Another Quaalude,
she gonna love me again.
(PEOPLE MURMURlNG)
What're you looking at?
You're all a bunch
of fucking assholes.
You know why?
You don't have the guts
to be what you want to be.
You need people like me.
You need people like me
so you can point
your fucking fingers
and say,
"That's the bad guy."
So, what does
that make you?
Good?
You're not good.
You just know
how to hide,
how to lie.
Me, l don't have
that problem.
Me, l always
tell the truth.
Even when l lie.
So say good night
to the bad guy!
Come on.
The last time you
gonna see a bad guy
like this again,
let me tell you.
Come on. Make way
for the bad guy.
There's a bad guy

Better get out
of his way!
