What kind of work did he do?
Chief.
DETECTIVE KOICHI TAKESHITA
Hey, watch it!
Oi, that hurts!
Watch it, pal!
Any special girl you want?
- What are you doing?
- Bring the best.
Yes, sir!
Waiter, ice!
Quite a playboy, isn't he?
He's a good customer.
He's already spent 70,000.
Who is it?
- Somebody beat up Ken.
- You guys take care of it.
He says it was a total stranger.
- Where's Ken?
- Outside.
Forget about this stranger.
Just pay him off.
Maybe this guy's from the Sanko mob.
They're no match for us.
Just forget it.
Get Ken in here.
Is that the guy?
That's him!
The total is 72,500 yen.
- Any policemen around?
- Why do you ask?
Well, I've got no money.
Don't bullshit us!
Wait.
Let's settle this peacefully
in the office.
Stop.
He isn't packing.
This room is completely soundproof.
One false move
and they'll blow you away,
so watch your step.
You're new.
Where are you from?
I hear you've been
messing around on our turf.
You got some grudge
against Nomoto Enterprises?
Spit it out or you'll get hurt.
I just felt like doing it.
If it had been this lady here,
I would've been gentler.
- Smart ass!
- Shut your face!
Good thing it's soundproof.
Turn around.
- What for?
- Do as I say.
You stay here.
Get up.
Whatever they're paying you,
I'll double it.
Name your price.
One million yen up front.
You got it.
And 200,000 yen a month.
- Then...
- Did you think I was a hit man?
I just wanted a job.
Thanks for hiring me.
Good.
I'll introduce you to the boss.
You aren't the boss?
You keep wanting more,
but our neighbourhoods a slum!
- You can't ask for so much.
- That's enough!
NOMOTO RESIDENCE
Call yourself a killer?
You'd be faster with a gun.
I dislike such unreliable weapons.
I like to feel the results
with my own hand.
These are the best.
- Put that away.
- I don't like being shot in the back.
So you can take your hand
off the gun.
Let's get rid of them together.
You've got a few things to learn.
So do you.
I'm Minami.
We should get along fine.
We will. I'm Joji Mizuno.
Call me Jo for short.
Don't touch!
He's never been able
to hold a gun in his left hand.
How about introducing me
to the boss?
I'm Nomoto.
You lot should act
more respectable!
You still act like yakuza
off the street.
Minami...
I told you to wear a tie, didn't I?
You won't believe this,
but alcohol and women
are my weaknesses.
- Where are you staying?
- The Hibiya Hotel.
The Hibiya Hotel?
That's classy!
- Can you afford it?
- No, I'm flat broke.
So you're going to do a runner then?
You've got guts.
I'll pick up the hotel tab for you.
Minami, take care of him.
He could be useful.
Is he really at the Hibiya?
Forget it.
He won't be on your list.
- Here he is.
- Yeah?
From Abashiri,
the prison town in Hokkaido.
Just a moment, sir.
That's one hell of a suitcase!
- Nomoto runs this place too?
- Yeah.
Jo, what's in there?
You have to report to your boss, right?
The tools of my trade.
I take better care of them
than I do of myself.
Pretty impressive!
I'll show you around,
then on your first job,
you can show us what you're capable of.
Minami... This is for you.
<i>30...</i>
Good day to you, sir.
- He's their new hand.
- Name?
J0 Mizuno, I think.
A bit of a maverick, but I hear he's good.
Boss, it's a shakedown!
- What?
- Where?
The real estate office.
Some guy's blackmailing them.
What?
There's the deed.
Write out a cheque.
How the hell can I pay
three million yen?
- Just write it.
- You can't threaten me!
You can't do anything to me.
Get out!
I'll write it! I'll write the cheque!
Hold it right there.
You almost pulled it off,
but you got a little overconfident.
To hell with your plan!
Hold it!
Hold it!
I said hold it.
Jo, let's finish the job.
I've changed my mind now.
I've decided I want
the three million in cash.
Please! Just a little, please!
No. Drugs are expensive.
I can't give you any.
Don't say that.
I promise I'll work harder!
Shut up!
It hurts so bad.
Quick! Give me some quick!
You want it that much? Here you go.
Give it to me.
Wait!
The dope!
Fuck you!
You're inhuman!
If you want it, get your ass out there
and make me some money.
Stop playing around
with your boyfriend.
Well? Do you understand?
How did the job go?
Boss!
That's the first time
I've pulled that trick.
Here's the three million.
Just like J0 said,
there was a guy on the balcony.
From now on,
I won't work without him.
Jo, I checked you out.
You're clean.
You're now on the payroll.
Here's your front money.
I'm gonna hang out with you today.
Sorry, not today.
I have a memorial service to attend.
An old friend of mine.
A memorial service?
- Oh, thank you.
- Not at all...
Seeing these photos makes you feel
like Takeshita's still alive.
He used to love to sing
when he got drunk, didn't he?
Hello?
Mrs Takeshita?
My name is Mizuno.
My condolences.
Thank you.
Along time ago,
your husband was very kind to me.
Is that right?
Please, come inside.
Thank you.
Thank you for coming.
Please stay and eat.
Thanks, but I must go.
Would you mind telling me
a story about my husband?
Hello? Takeshita speaking.
A yellow sweater?
I'm sorry, but we're all out
of yellow wool.
How about red?
TAKESHITA
KNITTING SCHOOL
LOOKING FOR A GORGEOUS DATE?
CALL CLUB AOI
Look carefully.
You're sure she didn't work
at your club?
- Yes.
- Thanks.
Go out the back way.
A man's been following us.
DOUBLE SUICIDE
Come over here,
I need to talk to you.
But I'm naked.
Me too. I've already had a shower.
That was careless,
rushing into the bathroom like that.
What if I were a killer?
- I'm only joking. Come here.
- What are you after?
- What do you mean?
- Don't play dumb.
What brings you here?
I just want
to get to know you, silly.
You're so strong.
I want you to kill a woman.
- Find her and then kill her.
- Who?
Let's make love.
Tell me which woman.
You won't have much luck in marriage.
Three wives, it says.
I thought I'd marry you,
but I'd better not.
- Stop joking around.
- It's no joke. I'm here to talk to you.
I want you to kill
the boss's sixth mistress.
Just kill her.
Fun, isn't it?
I'm going to build a tomb for her.
You know the suicide case
involving that detective?
That girl with him
was one of our call girls.
The paper said she was a clerk.
Yes, that was just a cover.
- Most of our girls have covers.
- And?
The boss's sixth mistress runs the show.
Nobody's ever seen her,
and Nomoto keeps quiet about her.
- But they can't fool me.
- A woman's intuition, eh?
Find her.
Will you kill her?
First tell me why.
Is it jealousy? Money?
Everything!
She's the only one I can't control.
I see.
And what's in it for me?
- Half of what I get.
- And if I say no?
I'll say you dragged me here
and raped me.
He's insanely jealous,
so that'll be the end of you.
Not a bad deal.
But what happens...
if I find her more attractive than you,
or if she pays me more?
LOVELY YOUNG LADIES
AT THE MURASAKI CLUB
No girls right now?
Tonight's fine, then.
Send one to the Hibiya Hotel at 8:00.
What's this? Why so upset?
- Nothing.
- Better safe than sorry.
What's on your mind?
Our boss wants to see you
to thank you.
All right, but not right now.
What?
Not like this, anyway.
I don't like people
telling me what to do.
- He's got a big mouth!
- You're going to kill me here?
The cops are nearby,
and this area's full of apartments.
From this range, it'd be hard
not to blow your face off.
Go ahead.
The cops are nearby,
and this area's full of apartments.
That's my line, fool.
Now drop the guns.
- Let's go.
- What?
You said your boss
wanted to see me, right?
Shut up!
You don't care
if you've got to close up shop?
Pay us a little more
and you'll be safe, pachinko man.
I hear you're leaning towards
Nomoto Enterprises, right?
Answer me!
Watch it or they'll do you in.
Good work, thanks.
So, they brought you in.
Wrong. I came on my own.
What? Don't be a sore loser.
Tell him.
He's got a gun.
AgUn?
Give 'em the full details.
It's a shotgun.
It can blow your face off.
Blow my face off?
Sounds like fun. Show me.
Hold it!
We don't want our guest hurt.
Show him out first.
Do it!
Come on!
Take it easy.
I don't know what Nomoto pays you,
but I'll double it.
Why do all you big shots
say the same stupid lines?
Fine. Everyone out.
I need to talk to your boss.
Out!
Now, how much?
- Give me your gun.
- Don't! You'll put the boss in danger.
Shut up! I can't just stand by.
No, don't!
Watch this.
I'll get him in the back.
One million up front
and 200,000 a month.
I'll give you one and a half million,
and 300,000.
- Join us.
- No way.
That's our top salary.
- I want N0m0t0's, too.
- You can't do that.
N0m0t0's buying guns
to crush your mob.
What?
I'll spy on them for you.
Nomoto was originally
one of your men, right?
You should attack first
and wipe him out,
but don't let me pressure you.
- It's a deal.
- Thanks.
Hold it!
He overheard us!
I heard nothing, and I'll never talk.
Leave him. He won't grass.
Besides, we're all partners now.
I'll let it go for now.
- All right, let's go.
- What?
You're my shield.
We're enemies on the outside.
I've got to stay on my guard.
Don't!
I went to your apartment...
...and saw you being taken away.
But I knew you'd come out on top.
I did, thanks to this.
I see. The hammer's broken.
Those idiots would be
so pissed off if they knew.
Minami... Do we run call girls?
Call girls?
This'll cost a fortune to fix.
Onodera kept asking
if we ran call girls. Do we?
Have some of this. It's great.
Don't you know anything?
All I'm interested in is guns.
Nothing else.
That's why they make fun of you.
Even Onodera knows
a woman runs the business.
A woman?
Alcohol and women are bad for me.
You're like that broken shotgun.
A useless piece of shit!
Go to sleep!
As useless as a broken shotgun?
How dare you call me useless!
You're the useless one!
He wasn't talking about a woman.
He meant Hideo.
The boss's brother. He's gay.
The one you met at his house.
Don't forget I know everything
about our gang!
I'm sorry.
Tell me about Hideo.
Sure.
His mother was a whore after the war.
Specialised in black men.
But never mention that to him.
A drunk woman once called him
"a son of a whore".
He carved her face up with a razor.
I saw it.
Her face looked like a bamboo blind.
A blind, eh?
Hideo with the razor...
Hello, the Murasaki Club here.
<i>Send me one.</i>
- And your name?
- Yoshida.
- Where <i>are you?</i>
- <i>In Shibuya.</i>
Call us back in 30 minutes
from the pay phone at Namikibashi,
then we can discuss the place, okay?
Do you have a car?
Arrange it for me.
Keep this quiet.
Hello?
Yeah. Looks like
there's nothing dodgy about him.
And looks like he can pay.
Get me 416-1920, please.
Hello? It's me.
Do we have a girl for 3:00pm?
Send her to Shibuya Public Hall.
Thanks.
Are you Hideo with the razor?
- You know me, right?
- No.
Really?
Who were you just calling?
Who were you calling?
It's none of your business.
- You're going to take me there.
- Where?
The place you just called.
I can find out anyway.
Hello? Put me through
to the same number as before.
Just do it!
Hello. Nomoto Enterprises?
What's your number?
416-1920. Nomoto?
I have some business to see to.
I heard your mother was a whore.
Keep quiet or I'll carve your face up.
- Please don't!
- Tell me who your partner is.
I don't know.
You want to look
like a bamboo blind too?
Stop! I'll talk.
Who is it?
What are you doing?
Talk.
Why did you do it?
Start talking, or it'll be more
than just your face that'll look different!
I'll never talk,
no matter what you do to me.
Who sent you?
Talk.
Stop it!
Stop it!
I'm sorry.
I'll never do it again.
Forgive me. Please!
You fool!
If you don't suspect me,
just let me go.
Just shut up and watch!
Go on! Get out!
Stop it!
- Hey, don't.
- What's going on?
He always gets like that,
beating up women. It excites him.
He's a sadist.
There's a deal.
Be at the house by 2:00.
What deal?
- Drugs.
- Where?
Just be there at 2:00.
Hello? The Sanko Group.
The boss isn't here!
What?
Good morning. It's for you, boss.
Let's talk.
I told you to come alone.
I'm carrying money,
I need protection.
All right.
N0m0t0's got a drug deal
planned for ten million.
Really? Where?
Wait till the deal's done,
then strike and take the money.
Just the money.
Forget N0m0t0's drugs.
- Why's that?
- Because they'll think Nomoto did it.
They'll never sell drugs to him again.
Drugs are the backbone of the mob.
Without them, well...
I see. And then N0m0t0's finished.
I'm indebted to you.
But why would you tell us this?
- You got a grudge against them?
- No, I just want the money.
On this deal,
I'll take four of the ten million.
With two million in advance.
Two million?
- You've not much time to decide...
- Where's it happening?
...otherwise we can forget
the whole thing.
Two million?
Two milli0n's cheap
for a chance to finish off Nomoto.
- I should be at N0m0t0's at 2:00?
- Yeah. Just follow behind me in the car.
One blast of the horn means
it's the Nomoto car.
Two means the other car
has the money.
Oi, Takechi,
you've been laying low recently.
Hello, Officer.
Mizuno!
Mizuno, why did you attend
Takeshita's memorial service?
It's like you were insulting him.
Have you joined with Nomoto now?
I heard you had.
Takeshita didn't talk much about you,
but he took what you did pretty hard.
He'd be even more shocked at this.
Don't give me that sentimental crap.
You've changed
since you went to Kobe.
Embezzlement? It's a set-up.
No, I looked into it.
You did it, just as the letter says.
No, I just borrowed the money
for the investigation.
- Why didn't you clear it first?
- I had no proof.
It was a hunch.
The boss wouldn't have understood.
Please understand.
I know the Sakura mob
wrote that letter.
I wonder how they knew.
Anyway, this shows they've panicked.
Can you keep quiet about this for me?
You're sure about this?
Well?
I'd stake my life on it.
All right,
I'll forget about this letter.
- I don't care what happens to it.
- Thanks.
Just don't go too far,
or you'll risk your life.
Thanks. I'm grateful.
That night, I tortured
one of the Sakura mob.
I went so far
that he could no longer talk.
That's how it ended.
I was arrested for assault
and embezzlement and went to prison.
I was framed by the mob.
Takeshita almost lost his job.
That Takeshita...
In spite of all the trouble
I'd caused him...
...he took care of my wife
while I was in jail.
She had TB,
and he got her into the hospital.
He even sent her money
every month
on his pittance of a salary.
But in the end, my wife died.
He was quite a guy.
Mizuno...
I had no chance to pay him back.
When he was killed, I figured
this was my chance to repay him.
- So I'm after his murderer.
- It was a double suicide.
You think Takeshita
would cheat on his wife?
He was so awkward with women.
- There's proof.
- What proof?
It was a trap. He was framed like me,
and then murdered.
You think the murderer is
with Nomoto?
You know Yosuke lshiyama?
You do, right?
This is him in Kobe.
Look familiar?
A drug tycoon.
When he moved to Tokyo,
Takeshita was transferred here too.
Ishiyama's real smart.
Takeshita searched for proof.
I met a guy in prison
who Takeshita once arrested.
A Nomoto mobster.
He'll be here soon.
Have you got an appointment
or something?
I'll get Takeshita's killer.
Idiot! That's not your job.
Leave it to the cops,
we'll look into it.
No way.
An eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth.
- I'll kill the killers.
- Listen, Mizuno...
- Stop here.
- Don't! Take us to police HQ.
Stop here!
Stop!
Don't worry. I'll be in touch.
Take him home.
I'm arresting you
for illegal possession of a firearm.
- You gonna cuff me?
- Don't be an idiot.
Don't take it out on the car,
you fuck!
He fucking tricked us.
Who fed you the info?
I'm too ashamed to say.
Check him out.
Looks like he's in a hurry.
He mustn't see us.
Hide, you idiots!
- What is it?
- I think I've seen him before.
- Who is he?
- Maybe I imagined it.
Long time no see.
How about some mah-jong tonight?
- Sounds great.
- Business first.
Perfect.
The deal's done.
We're changing cars.
Sorry.
I know you.
Maybe not...
- What's up?
- Nothing.
I think we've met before.
I get around.
I can't remember everyone I meet.
One blast of the horn.
Get the Nomoto car.
Hand the money over.
Hand it over!
You'll never get away with this.
Shut up!
Hurry UP!
We have just one thing
to say to you.
You have to pay us again.
Mr lshiyama, you've got it wrong.
We didn't do it. I swear.
The only ones who knew the details
were you and us.
- But...
- If you don't pay, then fine.
That'll be the end
of any further dealings.
Wait a minute.
Please don't jump to conclusions.
Boss...
What is it, Shibata?
That guy driving the car...
He's a cop!
I'm sure I saw him in Kobe.
Who was it?
It was Jo.
That's four million for me.
Not a bad deal.
Let's do business again sometime.
I'd be happy too,
but are you sure it's okay?
Not all of N0m0t0's men are fools.
I know.
She just has to join me for lunch,
that's all.
Have her wait at the Hibiya Hotel.
A red flower on her handbag?
Got it.
Here you are.
You wanted me to see these people?
No, I'll send them away.
He tells me to work and work,
but look at the guy he sends me to!
Go tell Hideo that
he should be more selective!
Anything else?
Tell him he's an idiot too!
Minami, let's get it over with.
I won't shoot J0!
- Where's the money?
- Money?
The money your men stole
from Mr Shibata.
What are you talking about?
You're with the Kobe police.
I met you three years ago.
Take a look at this!
You bastard!
Why didn't you just ask me
if you wanted to know?
That picture means nothing.
- So you're a cop?
- I was.
Listen, three years ago,
I was arrested
for assault and embezzlement.
Don't forget I did time too!
Check it out.
It was in the police gazette
three years ago.
Damn you!
You cut my finger for that!
Get someone to check it out!
DETECTIVE MIZUNO ARRESTED
FOR ASSAULT, EMBEZZLEMENT
I'll get you back for this, boss!
Don't fucking talk to him like that!
Hold it.
You have reason to be angry.
I'm sorry.
Let's settle this.
How much do you want
for your finger?
I'll take one of yours, boss.
- Can you prove it wasn't you?
- Now you ask me?
Any ideas who it was?
I saw a guy from the Sanko mob there.
- The Sanko mob?
- Yeah, by the bridge.
I'm sure of it.
I bet he sent the signal.
You sure you're not mistaken?
Don't ask if you won't listen.
Why don't you get the guy?
- What's his name?
- Just some punk.
But I remember his face.
See you again.
So it was you and your buddies, huh?
- I don't know what...
- Bullshit!
Talk! It was you guys, wasn't it?
Minami, throw this dumb fuck
in the river!
All right! We did it.
Now you tell us.
- So they did do it.
- One last question.
I'll ask you only once:
did you set it up?
No! I did as Takechi told me!
Takechi?
How did he know?
I don't know.
Don't give me this bullshit!
Whatever you might think,
I'm a Sanko man!
I never lie!
You'll be dishonoured
if you drown me in the river.
Kill me with a gun.
Shoot me straight in the heart.
Lock him in the basement.
Boss, this looks like a challenge
from the Sanko mob.
Damn them!
Onodera plotted all this.
We'll go on the offensive, damn it!
Hold it.
We can get them anytime.
First, we find out from Takechi
who the informant was.
It's my honour on the line.
Let me handle this.
416-1920.
You guys work with Jo.
- No, let me do this.
- Come on, Jo.
<i>Who is it?</i>
Sorry to bother you.
ls Takechi in?
<i>He's not back yet.</i>
Tell us the truth.
When's he expected back?
She's beautiful.
Minami, don't get any ideas.
All we've got to do is wait.
You, outside.
Thirty-minute shifts.
Minami, your shift.
It's your turn.
I wanna stay with her.
For you, I'm drinking
for the first time in my life.
What if he puts up a fight?
Our orders are not to kill him.
RUN. NOMOTO'S SET A TRAP. JO
Minami, that's enough.
What if Nomoto finds out?
You don't have to tell him.
I've fallen for her.
Don't look at me like that.
We just have to get Takechi, right?
Jo, change places.
No. Why should Minami
have all the fun?
I don't like it.
You keep lookout, if you want.
I never thought
you'd fall for a woman.
I thought touching a statue's ass
was all you could handle.
The key!
By the door.
Your husband's gonna die anyway.
He can have some fun with you.
You all right, Minami?
Listen, lshizaki and Takechi
shot each other.
Leave me here.
I wanna be with her.
There's been a murder!
Stop!
<i>Jo...</i> You can't make it with me.
Leave me here.
Don't be stupid.
You go. I'll stay here.
I don't want the police
to get hold of you.
Stay here. I'll take a look.
She was a fine woman.
TAKESHITA
KNITTING SCHOOL
- You?
- Sorry, but he's wounded.
Can we come in?
Doesn't he need a doctor?
No, I'll see to him.
I'll take the slug out.
Your deceased husband and I
were detectives together.
But I got fired
over a certain incident.
I didn't believe the story
about what happened to him.
I checked it out myself and I found out
that he didn't kill himself.
He was murdered.
- Really?
- It's the truth.
You know he couldn't
have done it, don't you?
Not with a call girl.
She worked for Nomoto.
The note was a fake.
She didn't know she'd be killed as well.
- Who did it?
- I don't know yet.
Someone in Nomoto's mob.
I joined them to find out.
I'm getting close.
If the cops come in now,
I'll never find out.
Will you help me?
Just look the other way for a while.
I understand.
Thanks. I'll get started now.
<i>Nomoto here.
10? What's up?</i>
Takechi surprised us.
The Sanko mob know what we're up to.
Just think if they find out
about Takechi getting hit.
They're probably already
planning revenge.
- Where are you?
- <i>Now?</i>
<i>At the Takeshita Knitting School.</i>
Please send help as soon as possible.
Hurry, or Minami will die. Thanks.
Oh, it's you. What's up?
What? Takechi's dead?
Nomoto did it? That bastard...
They're preparing to attack.
I'll bet they're the ones
who started this.
Be careful.
"Forewarned is forearmed,"
as the saying goes.
You can count on me.
Will you do us another favour,
Mrs Takeshita?
Someone's coming for him.
Will you go with them?
- No!
- You've seen his face.
If they see you alive,
Nomoto will suspect me.
Don't worry.
Trust me, I'll protect you.
Thanks. I didn't expect
you'd come in person, boss.
- How's Minami?
- Still unconscious.
Better take this woman with you.
She'll just get in the way
of our attack.
- Then you're gonna...
- I won't kill her.
I'll leave Hideo to watch her.
There's nothing to worry about.
Boss!
All right?
Keep a good eye on her.
There's something dodgy
about the Sanko mob.
- They may be getting ready to attack.
- lnui will keep us informed.
Sir? Sir?
You ran right into this...
Look!
Bastard!
We caught a Nomoto guy!
Don't bother about him.
The more they think
we're making a big deal of this...
...the more of them we can lure in.
We'll get them
all together in one place,
then let them have this.
Kaboom!
That'll be the end of them.
<i>Let' s, gm!</i>
If we're successful,
you can take over their turf.
Thanks. Let's get going.
Jo, come here for a sec.
You're not going.
With Minami and lshizaki dead,
I'll be needed.
You'd only sit back and watch anyway!
Freeze!
What is it this time?
Thanks a lot, Jo.
- For all your lies.
- What? I was...
Stop playing dumb!
We know everything.
We know you joined us
to avenge your pal.
And you're in with the Sanko mob
to wipe us out!
Who told you that crap?
Stop playing innocent.
Who was it?
Shit, we're too late!
They're coming!
The more, the better!
This is our chance, guys!
Wait!
Leave it to me, boss.
I'll go first, and then you follow.
Good. If you do it,
you can have their turf.
Come with me if you want!
Don't let them die in vain. Go!
Go! Next!
Attack them!
Crush him and you get all his turf!
Go! Will nobody go?
Fuck that Nomoto!
Fuck him!
Now talk!
- Did you kill Detective Takeshita?
- No.
- Talk or I'll blow those fingers off!
- No!
- Then who was it?
- I don't know.
I'll ask again.
Who killed him and why?
Really, I don't know!
- Talk!
- I don't know!
Would you talk if you were me?
What's Takeshita's wife to you?
- Want to lose all your fingers?
- Don't you know?
She's my sixth mistress.
Shit! You promised not to shoot!
A promise to you is nothing.
I want to kill you,
but I've promised to keep you alive.
So it's just three fingers today.
One day you'll lose all your limbs!
Just remember that!
You shouldn't let someone live
who has a grudge against you.
You've a lot to learn.
- A wrong number?
- They thought this was a clinic.
Are you hungry?
Your brother's missing
three fingers now.
You want to lose your nose?
Who killed Takeshita?
Say it again. Who killed Takeshita?
Say the name!
It was you who killed Takeshita.
- No! How could I?
- He knew your secret.
That's madness! You can't prove it.
Nomoto sang like a bird!
I shot off three of his fingers.
There'll be no mercy for you either.
You admit it?
Nomoto did it. I had to help.
He threatened me.
- Was Nomoto there?
- Yes.
- And the motive?
- He found out about our call girl ring.
What were you to Nomoto?
His lover.
- Why did you marry Takeshita?
- Nomoto ordered me to.
He wanted me to spy on the police.
How did you snare him?
He fell for me.
- I was his first love.
- How did you kill him?
Chloroform and an overdose
of sleeping pills.
Then we took him to the hotel.
- What about the woman?
- Nomoto killed her.
Are you sure?
I didn't want to kill him.
I had to, he made me do it!
He's a sadist.
Killing means nothing to him.
If I refused,
he would have killed me too!
Don't look at me like that!
It's been hell for me, too.
I looked for a way
to escape from Nomoto.
But I couldn't.
I'm sorry I killed him.
I really did love him.
It's not a lie.
At first, the marriage was
only part of a clever plan.
But then I truly fell in love.
I wanted us both
to get away from Nomoto.
Honestly, I did.
I thought if I told him
all about the call girls and drugs,
he'd put a stop to it all.
I'd have done it,
if we weren't up against Nomoto.
But it would never work.
He'd chase an informer down,
even to the ends of the earth.
There's no way to save yourself.
I loved Takeshita,
but I was terrified of Nomoto.
Is that unforgivable?
He threatened me.
I was a victim too!
Mr Mizuno, please!
I have a feeling you'll help me.
You were a victim.
And I know he was a sadist.
I wonder what kind of childhood
he and his brother had.
- Their mother was...
- Yes, she was a street whore.
Even at 40 years old.
Put me through
to Detective Hirokawa.
Hirokawa?
Yeah, it's finally over.
<i>Mizuno, where are you?</i>
<i>Hello? Hello?
What's wrong, Mizuno?</i>
<i>Who killed Takeshita?
Say the name!</i>
<i>- Mrs Kumiko Takeshita.
- How do you know that?</i>
<i>She called me.</i>
<i>My brother and I moved the body.</i>
- <i>Was Nomoto there during the act?</i>
- <i>No.</i>
- <i>All he did was help move the body?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>
<i>He didn't like the fact
that she 'd married Takeshita.</i>
<i>She came up with the plan
all by herself.</i>
<i>And the girl who was killed?</i>
<i>Kumiko killed her too.</i>
<i>And the phone number
416-1920?</i>
<i>An unlisted number.</i>
