Why does the old bitch pick on me?
That's the second time this week. I nearly
told her what she could do with the job.
Hey, you asleep?
That's what I asked her.
She wants me to stay till 7:00 again.
[Woman]
What polish are you putting on?
- The usual one, madame.
- Oh, I'm fed up with it.
I feel like a change.
- Uh, give me Revlon's Fire and Ice.

No?

Well, just a...just a minute.
What about tonight?
I'm sorry, but I'm busy tonight.
You really make me feel wanted.
Who's the lucky boy?
I'm having dinner with my sister.
Is she a good cook?
[Chuckles]
I don't know. I never thought about it.
Well, at least it can't be
any worse than fish and chips.

I think we are having rabbit.
Rabbit? Oh.

No, I think the friend has rabbits.
Poor bunny.

Ten or 12 days.

I heard such a funny story
on the news this evening.
Does he have to leave his things
in the bathroom?
The minister of health...
What's his name?
He found eels coming out of his sink.
It was on the television.
Even the announcer was laughing.
Why does he put his toothbrush in my glass?
Carol, please.
We must get this crack mended.

You're early.
I didn't expect you for hours.
I couldn't live without you
for another minute.
Idiot. Anyway, you said 8:30.
I haven't even started yet.
There's a marvelous story
in this evening's paper.
- It takes at least one hour.
- Huh?
Your rabbit. I'm cooking it.
Look. "Bring to the boil. Skim and allow to
simmer slowly for one and a half hours."
Yes. Well, we'll eat out tonight.
I'll take you out.
- Here. Look. Read that.
- [Bell Clanging]
Oh, I know that.
I saw it on television.
- That bloody bell.
- [Clanging Continues]
Eels. [Chuckles]
Pity it wasn't lobster though.
You never give me a chance
to show you what a good cook I am.
- Well, you can tell me over dinner.
- [Clanging Continues]
You'd think they'd have something better to
do than clang away like that all the time.
Hmm. It's worse when they start
doing it at midnight.
I wonder what they ring it for anyway.
Perhaps they have wild parties.
- Maybe they'll invite me sometime.
- [Chuckles]
[Clanging Stops]
Go and put your best bib and tucker on.
I feel like a spree.
Ah.
The beautiful younger sister.
Comment ça va?
I thought you were eating in.
Aren't you going to have dinner?
Yes. I'm going to have dinner.
- But not here.
- No.
Not here.
[Sighs]
Pass me that brush, will you?
There's a love.
Just because I go out once,
there's no need to start sulking.
- I'm not sulking.
- Hmm. Well, you're not exactly smiling.
Come on. You're not going in
for the Miss World competition.
[Elevator Whirs]
Will we go and see
the Leaning Tower of Pisa?
I don't think Cinderella likes me.
- Cinderella?
- The little sister.
Ah, don't be silly.
Well, are we going to see
the Leaning Tower of Pisa?
She's a bit strung-up, isn't she?
- She's just sensitive. That's all.
- [Chuckles]
You can say that again.
She should see a doctor.
- What do you mean?
- Nothing, nothing, nothing.
- No. You tell me what you meant by that.
- Nothing. Let's forget it.
You want to see the Leaning Tower of Pisa,
we'll see the bloody thing. Now let's relax.
We're going to dinner,

Well, what were you up to
for the last three days?
Nothing. I stayed at home.
Oh, well. That's enough
to drive anyone up the wall.
You ought to go out,
go to a movie or something.
- Oh, I'd love to.
- That's it then. Do it.
We saw such a funny Chaplin film
at the Classic the other night.
What was it called? [Laughs]
I thought I'd die laughing.
He was so hungry,
he wanted to eat his shoe.
- No.
- Yes.
He pretended the laces were spaghetti.
There was this huge, great big fat man
who wanted to eat him.
- What? Him?
- Yes.
He wanted to eat Charlie Chaplin.
He thought Charlie was a chicken.
- Chicken?

By the end of the evening,
she'll be begging for it.
- You'll soon be able to stop twitching.
- She'll weep with gratitude.
Yeah. Maybe we will too.
- Maybe you want your face pushed in.
- Here. Take your hands off me.
Colin, for heaven's sake.
Relax. Take a joke.
Hit me or something.
Now, look, boy. You've got it bad. Look.
You see?
He's been in the sun too long.
Look, it was only a joke.
There's no need to bloody bust out going on

Well, I doubt that, my dear.
I can see it with my own eyes.
Now then, what's the idea
of barricading the door against me?
[Woman Shouting In Distance]
You're not only late with the rent...
but you're damaging the property.
I've got the rent here.
[Chattering In Distance]
Let's have a little light on the subject.
No!
I'm not a bloody owl, you know.
[Woman Squealing, Shouting]
Ah, I thought I'd seen everything.
This is a flaming outhouse.
I don't know.
Uh, do you always, uh...
run around like, uh, this?
I mean to say, it's a bit, uh...
[Woman Squealing In Distance]
What's the matter?
You ill?
Ah.
The, uh, heat's getting you down, hmm?
Uh, I don't like it myself.
I'll, uh... I'll get you a...
a glass of water.
You're white as a sheet.
Hmm.
[Gasps]
What the hell is this?
[Groans]
Oh. No wonder you look ill, if you
have things like this hanging around.
[Groans]
It's the dustbin for you, my lad.
[Clattering]
[Loud Clattering]
Good Lord.
[Chuckles] Beats me
how you young people live in such a mess.
It's like a pigsty. Huh.
[Chuckling]
Ah. [Chuckles]
I know. Ah.
A nice, hot cup of tea
might be better, perhaps, hmm?
Of course, um,
your sister's gone away, hasn't she?
Yes, uh...
A nice, hot cup of tea and, uh...
and an aspirin...
and you'll be as right as rain.
You must be a bit lonely, I expect...
now she's gone.
Yes, I... I should have guessed it.
All alone, by the telephone.
There's, uh, no need to be alone, you know.
Huh?
Poor little girl.
All by herself.
All shaking
like a little frightened animal.
Oh. Ah.
Ah.
[Chuckles]
Ah.
[Woman Shouts In Distance]
They're your family, hmm?
Very nice. Hmm.
Yeah. There's no need
to be frightened of me, you know.
Is that you?
[Laughing] Huh?
Where was it taken? In, uh... In London?
- Brussels.
- Ah.
Ah. Brussels. Hmm.
[Woman Laughing, Squealing]
[Bell Clanging]
[Clanging Continues]
I could be a very good friend to you,
you know.
[Clanging Continues]
You... look after me...
and you can forget about the rent.
Come on. Come on. Just...
Just a little kiss between friends, huh?
Come on.

Carol?
[Helen Screams, Gasping]
[Hysterical Panting]
I say, what's the matter?
What a terrible smell.
What the hell's going on?
Well, get a grip of yourself, will you?
- Now, what's the matter?

[Groans] Ba... Bathroom.
[Water Dripping]

[Groaning] No! Oh!

I need to phone. I need to phone!
- Want a telephone?
- Yes, a telephone.
Oh.
[Dog Barks]
[Footsteps Approaching]
Everything will be all right.
He's gone to the porter's room
to make a telephone call.
She doesn't speak English, does she?
[Man] Yes, I think she does.
[Woman Gasps]
[Woman]
What's the matter? What's happened?
I don't know. We just came in.
Let's see. Oh.
[Man] Oh.
[Dog Whimpering]
Now, you better not touch her.
They've sent...
- [Man] I won't forget tonight in a hurry.
- Now, come... Now, don't touch her.
I'll get her some brandy.
- Has anyone called for an ambulance?
- Yes. He's gone to telephone now.
- Who?
- Man we saw on the stairs.
- Ah.
- Can anyone do artificial respiration?
[Man #1] You shouldn't touch her.
You shouldn't move her.
- [Woman] Oh, dear.
- I'll get her some brandy.
Somebody must help her.
Please, someone help her.
[Dog Whining]
[Man]
I wouldn't touch her. Don't touch her.
[Woman] What's he doing?
- [Man] Oh.
- [Woman] Good Lord.
- [Man] Oh, he's gotten her up.
- Please!
He shouldn't touch her.
