<i>SERENITY</i>
Do you see that, Captain?
Yeah. I see him.
What do you think?
You think the beast is close?
What do you say, Duke?
He's down there somewhere.
Making up his damn mind.
Yeah, boy!
Holy fuck.
Duke, get the fighting jacket.
Dill, what are you doing?
The hook is set.
You're going to have to hand over
the rod to the paying customer.
No, Duke. It's him.
How can you possibly know
it's the same fish?
I can feel it.
Take the wheel and hold her steady.
Okay, sir.
Can I take over the rod now, please?
Here we go, baby.
Sir, we paid you 700 bucks for this.
Dill, you struck. He's hooked.
Get out of the chair
and give the man the rod.
This is my brother's fish, sir.
Get off the fucking chair.
- Get in the hold.
- Oh, man.
Sit down and shut the fuck up,
the both of you.
Son of a bitch.
We paid you 700 plus gas.
Get the fuck out of here.
Looks like
this is a trophy fish, guys.
Go get some beers.
Enjoy the show, yeah?
Duke, take the wheel. He's headed
to open water. Follow him.
Here we go. Here we go, kid.
Here we go.
Fuck.
I got him.
Duke!
Take the leader. He's spent.
No. He still has spunk in him, Dill.
No, no. He's dead in the water.
Yeah.
You got him? Bring him up.
Maybe we should let the line
out a little?
No, no, no. He's done. Bring him up.
There he is. Easy.
That's right. Come on, Duke.
Here we go. Nice and steady.
We got him this time, kid.
- No, no!
- I'm sorry.
If you think we're gonna pay you
a fucking single dollar for this fiasco,
you're out of your fucking mind.
Lieutenant Gonzales said
without a paper contract,
there's nothing we can do.
So the gringos don't pay.
No kingfish to sell to Lionel
because you spent all day on tuna.
I'll pay you. Okay?
Yeah? How?
Mr Baker Dill, I am increasingly fond
of the way you say hello.
Jack said he heard
two fat guys in the Rope
say you pulled a knife on them.
You ever thought about taking
a course in customer relations?
And, by the way,
have you seen my damn cat?
I think he's up at Joe's.
I think old Joe's feeding him sprats.
You made it all the way
up to the cannery
before you decided
to turn around and see me.
Why did you come, Dill?
Why do you think?
It's just heard you went
to the Mercantile Bank this morning.
Who'd you get? Carter. Asshole.
How did you do?
Now, Constance,
you know damn well how did.
Round here
everybody knows everything.
Well, heard the bank refused
to extend your loan.
So now you can't even afford gas.
I'm just a little hurt you got
all the way as far as Joe's place
before you decided
on the last resort.
Baker Dill,
you're no more than a hooker.
Hooker who can't afford hooks.
How's your son?
Still pumping gas in Miami. Why?
Well, he was good around the boat.
If he ever wants to quit pumping gas,
I'd take him on.
What's wrong with Duke?
I don't know.
He's gone a little crazy.
Him or you?
You know, Duke's got
a grandkid in college.
He needs work that pays.
How dare old Joe feed my cat.
I like my cats to depend on me.
My sweet kitty.
Hey, Dill.
And one for old Wes.
There you go, Wes.
Heard you had him on again, Dill.
Old Wes wonders if it isn't the same
big old tuna that broke his heart.
You've hooked him five times
since New Year, right?
Four.
Why don't you give him a name?
Me and the boys were saying
you should give him a name.
Well, already gave him a name.
His name's Justice.
Tomorrow morning, 5: 30.
You got money for gas?
Well, if didn't, where would we go?
So how many have we got?
Dill? How many paying customers
are we taking out tomorrow?
None, Duke. Just you and me.
You can't afford to waste gas.
That was him today.
It was him.
Dear Lord, can't you put that man
and that damn fish together?
<i>Tomorrow's low tide at noon and 25.
High tide 2100.</i>
<i>Set fair
for a beautiful Plymouth day.</i>
Hey there, kitty cat.
Mama wants you home.
Sorry, kid.
Could have sworn he was spent.
Could feel it in my hands.
<i>ME AND DAD BACK THEN.</i>
Gonna fucking murder you!
<i>Good morning.</i>
<i>This is Plymouth Radio,</i>
<i>broadcasting to Plymouth Island
and the ocean all around.</i>
<i>It's another beautiful morning
here in Plymouth,</i>
<i>the most beautiful island
in this damn dirty world.</i>
<i>Temperature of mid-eighties,
humidity just perfect</i>
<i>and the air smells
of sweet sugar cane.</i>
<i>A perfect day to go out there
on the ocean</i>
<i>and catch that damn fish.</i>
<i>That was 'Mama Told Papa'.</i>
<i>What did Mama tell Papa?</i>
Alright, Kali,
just give me the damn fish, yeah?
Duke.
Reel 'em in.
We're done for the day.
I'll take the bait to Lionel
and at least get something for it.
No, Duke.
We don't deal fucking bait.
You know what?
Maybe it's about fucking luck.
Maybe you're bringing me
bad luck, Duke.
Ever since your wife died,
we haven't caught jack shit.
That's right.
Find yourself a commercial boat.
Alright, kid.
Just you and me now.
Give me a swizzle.
You know, Dill, there's an Indian
woman up by Mace's boatyard
who says
she can adjust people's luck.
She got that Argentinian couple
a baby.
Well, I don't need a baby, Jack.
You need something, man.
Yeah, need a drink.
Thought we'd established that.
Percentages are not science.
You can't tell the future from the past.
You need instinct.
And hear you just lost that.
Duke was in here
about half an hour ago.
Says he's available
for the morning shift.
Doctor Bob was in here drinking.
Said he heard about the knife.
Said maybe you should go and see him,
talk to him about your state of mind.
Was that before or after
his third tequila?
You and joke about that,
but some of the guys are concerned.
There's money
in fishing swordfish at night.
No asshole tourists on board.
Lionel pays
for grunts and flatfish too.
I fish tuna.
You fish for one tuna, man.
And that's a tuna
that's only in your head.
I'll get that.
Good to see you, John.
I'll have a sparkling water too.
Ice and lemon?
Why not?
So, what do you say?
I say I'm not called John any more.
Fate's funny, huh?
Okay, Karen,
I don't believe in coincidence.
Neither do I.
Welcome to Plymouth, ma'am.
Do you have a place here?
Maybe we can go to dinner?
Only place is the Rope
and you're in it.
I'd like to talk to you
someplace private.
I'd like to know
what the fuck you're doing out here
on the edge of nowhere.
I came to tell you
you were right and I was wrong.
Fuck.
I hear you have a boat.
You own this boat?
Well, me and the bank.
We take turns.
This is about as private as it gets.
How did you find me
and what do you want?
Back in the real world
they got this thing called Facebook.
- You ever heard of it?
- No.
Well, when I decided
to track you down,
I reached out
to some of the guys from school.
You remember Dotey?
The relentless one?
Well, she put together a class
reunion a couple of years ago.
The only two who didn't show
were you and me.
Nobody knew where you were.
Everybody knew about Iraq
and the medals.
So little Greg had gone fishing
on this boat
on some island in the middle
of nowhere and he had caught a fish
and had his photo taken with it.
And he said
that there was this guy in the shot
who looked just like John Mason.
Only he said the guy
was calling himself...
Baker Dill.
- Was it a big fish?
- Excuse me?
If he had his photo taken,
it must have been a big fish.
So I tracked down the photo.
Couldn't tell if it was you
standing there or not,
but the name gave it away,
Baker Dill.
Dillon Baker was the only teacher
you respected at Morgan.
He taught math, right?
You still haven't told me
what you want.
I figured if you were using
an assumed name, you were on the run.
I'm just waiting on some things
back home to lose their significance.
I thought you being outside the law
would be okay.
In fact it would be good.
Cause like say...
you were right and was wrong.
About Frank.
He got richer and bigger
and drunker and angrier.
Hands turned to fists.
So get a divorce.
Except I guess you can't.
No, can't.
He's even more connected than he was.
Cubans out of Miami.
If I tried to leave,
he'd find a hole for me
in one of his construction sites.
That's the truth.
I didn't come here
thinking you might forgive me.
He's violent with you, right?
Different kinds.
He's refined it lately.
And how's my son with that, Karen?
How's my son with this refinement?
He hides away.
<i>I swear to fucking God.
It's my fault. It's my fault.</i>
He gets scared when we fight.
<i>Fucking come back here you bitch.
Okay, I'm sorry. Daddy...</i>
He plays games.
He has his computer,
plays for hours and hours.
School says
he's got a unique ability,
but he just seems
kind of broken down.
<i>I take that little fucking prick in.
Don't make me come in there.</i>
John.
Saving Patrick
is the reason I'm here.
I'm in hell now, John.
This can be just business.
You need money.
Me and Patrick need a way out.
My husband is joining me here
the day after tomorrow.
I told him that I would charter
a boat for fishing tuna.
I want you to take him out
on your boat,
let him get drunk...
then drop him in the ocean
for the sharks.
In return I will give you
ten million dollars cash.
Listen, before the moon goes down,
I got fish to catch.
I need you the fuck off my boat.
Ten million dollars, John.
Get the fuck off my boat.
I'm at the American Hotel.
Mr Dill! Mr Baker Dill!
Can speak to you a moment?
Mr Dill! I just need
a few minutes of your time.
Ma'am. Do you know
the captain of that boat?
Hey, Constance.
What are you doing up here?
Looking for my damn cat.
Front pocket.
I'm allowed inside?
Only if you wipe your feet.
Thank you, ma'am.
I hear you got lucky last night.
Yeah, sure did.
Three swordfish over 50 pound.
800 bucks.
Plus cut out the cheeks
for breakfast. You want some?
They say she looks like
some kind of model.
Who?
Consuela said the lady said her
husband's coming here to catch tuna.
Doesn't anyone around here
do any work they're paid to do?
Is that why she came to see you?
Yep.
Are you going to take him out?
Nope.
Where are you going?
To take a shower.
<i>You're selfish, you fucking bitch.
You always have to go in.</i>
<i>Dad. There's something
I need you to do.</i>
<i>Don't you fucking dare.
You show me no fucking gratitude.</i>
Patrick?
Is that you?
Frank. God.
Rolled in a day early, baby.
But there were no flights today.
I rented a Learjet.
I had to come and get you.
Let's get this fucking show
on the road, huh?
I paid a fucking jet for this,
so let's... let's lose the robe.
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Turn around.
Nice and slow.
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
What's this?
Just a little scratch.
A little scratch, huh?
Playing with a cat maybe?
I don't know.
You don't know.
Okay.
Man of the moment. Your ears burning?
I've come to settle up, Lois.
Well, if you want my opinion,
I didn't think she was so special.
Parading right there on the quay
with some big hat and shades
like it's 90 degrees.
I owe you for 20 spoons, hooks
and a thousand yards of line.
That's 25 dollars.
And her husband. Man.
Her husband arrived on a jet
decorated like a cake.
Consuela says he came early
to surprise her.
Gave Carlos 150
for finding champagne at 10am.
A dozen regular sevens and a couple
of feathers as well, will you?
Going after swordfish again?
Guess you gotta pay the bills
now that Duke's gone.
Poor old Duke. He's got himself
some day work up at the boatyard.
Poor old Duke.
You shouldn't have blamed his wife
for your bad luck.
I don't. Blame your damn hooks.
Two cedars.
- For tuna?
- What else?
Swordfish at night, tuna in the day.
When are you gonna sleep?
When I've bought my boat
from the bank.
Nine dollars.
Then I'm gonna sail away to somewhere
where nobody knows your business.
What name are you gonna use there?
Consuela says the big guy beat her
with his hands and his belt.
Hour and a half.
She didn't make a sound.
Miami is some strange place, right?
Yep.
There was some skinny guy
from Fontaine looking for you.
He left you his card.
Captain. My wife says
you're being a little difficult.
Well, as explained
to your wife last night,
I don't have a first mate right now.
And by law I'm not allowed
to take tourists out alone.
The law, huh?
Funny you should say that.
Cause ain't seen any law around here
that'd cost more than ten bucks
since left Miami.
I can't afford to lose my license.
Take the cock out of your mouth.
Four years in a line I won
the Bermuda Yellow Fin Tournament.
54, 70, 73 and a 56 pounds.
Well, your proficiency
does not alter the regulations.
My proficiency. Jesus, he talks
like a fucking college professor.
My wife, my beautiful wife,
she arranged this trip.
She sat up on the fucking internet
night after night,
typing away to find the perfect boat
to make this trip perfect,
because she wants it to be perfect,
perfect for me.
Now, myself, well, I'd say a son of a
bitch runs a bucket same as any other,
and I'd fly to some other island.
But I don't got time.
I only got two days.
So, let's be here at seven,
just me, you
and the motherfucking tuna.
I already told you,
it's not worth the risk.
I'm not gonna do it.
Please think about it, Mr Dill.
It's okay, honey.
Every man has his price.
Tomorrow at 7am I'm gonna be here.
So should you.
Mr Dill!
Damn it. Damn it. Mr Dill!
There's something wrong.
There appears to be a 20-second
discrepancy in my allotted schedule.
Two nights in a row.
The moon change your luck?
I'd say 110 pounds.
And they're billfish?
Say 800 dollars?
Yesterday when you came in
with the swordfish,
I thought at last
Baker Dill has seen sense.
But hear from Lois
you bought new cedars.
So even though
you're making money on night fish,
you're still going out
after that fish that's in your head.
You do know
it's just in your head, right?
Well, hell, yeah.
That's why gotta get him out of there.
And yesterday there was
some skinny guy out of Fontaine.
Got here right after you left.
Hey, hey, hey. What are you doing
all the way down here, kitty cat?
I'll take you home,
collect my reward.
In a hurry today?
I need to be on the ocean before ten.
So tell me the truth, Dill.
You knew her before, right?
I hear she needs to be saved.
Yeah?
He gets drunk, beats her up.
You don't treat me badly.
We just lean on each other a little.
I give you cash
when the fish don't bite
and you find my cat when they do.
Catch the cat for Constance.
Okay, Dill,
say fate gave you the choice.
You can get the lady or you can
catch that tuna that's in your head.
Which one would you choose?
<i>Another beautiful day
on Plymouth Island.</i>
<i>Tuna, albacore, swords,
ready to catch. Clear blue sky.</i>
<i>One little thing, if you have a boat,
and, man, of course you have a boat,</i>
<i>maybe, just maybe, that rare thing,
storm is coming.</i>
Dill, the rich guy
is aboard your boat
already strapped
into the shotgun chair,
drinking champagne
from a bucket of bait ice.
Yeah, well, unstrap him.
And they say he drew ten thousand
in cash from the Mercantile.
I guess you want
a piece of the action, huh?
You listen to me.
Consuela heard the guy say to his wife
that he was going to offer you
the whole ten grand,
that he was going to do it
to prove a point,
to prove that some little fucking guy
can't say no.
Yeah? So what?
So I need the money.
You need the money.
We take him out, let him fish.
I'll take two, you take eight.
The Serenity needs an overhaul.
My granddaughter needs money
for the next semester.
Why would take you out, Duke?
You're bad luck.
No, no. Constance told me
the real reason you fired me.
Pity is worse
than a fist in the face.
I'm not begging you, Baker Dill,
I'm just telling you.
When life offers you an opportunity
like this, you have to take it.
Okay.
But you stay close to me today, Duke.
You hear me?
I need you to deliver me
from temptation.
Temptation? What temptation?
You don't need to know.
I'm heading to the boat.
I'll be there...
John. My husband's offering
ten thousand dollars.
This is Plymouth. I already know.
You gonna take him?
Yep. I'm gonna take him out.
That's it.
My first mate Duke
will be on board with me.
We will fish until the sun sets
and then return.
All three of us.
Then we'll go back and Patrick
will hear the key in the door.
And then on it goes and on.
The three of us.
I know you think about him
all the time. I know you do, Dill.
You talk to him...
about catching a particular fish.
He hears you
through his computer screen.
Captain?
The gentleman has brought
hard liquor aboard.
That's against the rules, right?
It's okay, Duke.
The rules have changed.
It's true.
He hears you
every time you talk to him.
You are connected.
John?
Take a look, Dill.
Yeah, saw him earlier.
He was circling
right over the harbour.
A frigate?
Frigate don't fly over land.
I know. It's the damnedest thing.
Like the son of a bitch
was coming to collect me.
Frigate don't fly over land, Dill.
You must have been mistaken.
There's some weird stuff
going on right now.
How do you guys live in a town
with only one fucking bar?
The Rope's not so bad.
It used to be called
the Hope & Anchor.
Then old Jack decided there wasn't
much hope to be had in Plymouth,
so he changed 'hope' to 'rope'.
Lots of rope in Plymouth.
Enough to hang yourself.
Isn't that right, Dill?
Is that right?
Maybe we should
throw out some bait, huh?
Come on,
let's fucking chum the waters.
What do you guys do for girls
in this town?
- You, what do you do?
- Not much.
Not much, no?
What about you, Dull?
It's kind of a small island.
The guy at the hotel
says in the poor part of town,
down by the commercial harbour,
you got little girls who take it
right in the ass for ten bucks a pop.
Right?
You know anything about that?
I wouldn't know
anything about that, sir.
Yeah.
Well, I'm gonna
fucking head up there tonight
and grab myself
some of that ten-dollar ass.
You don't have kids, do you,
Mr Zariakas?
No.
My wife's got this son
from a previous fuck-up, though.
Creepy little fuck.
<i>Open the door.
Patrick, open the door.</i>
<i>Come on, just wanna talk.</i>
You know, I try. I really fucking do.
I say,
Come on, kid, let's go outside.'
Let's toss a football around.
Let's play some football like men.'
But he just sits there
staring at his computer screen
like he's staring out a window
all day fucking long
with the curtains closed.
<i>Get out here.
Have a fucking talk to me like a man.</i>
He's got a maths teacher
who thinks he's a genius.
That fucking genius
can't even screw a bell on a bike.
<i>Goddamn it!
You open the door, you little prick.</i>
One day I grab him,
I throw him off his chair,
I wanna see what he's doing.
You know, I'm thinking whatever,
porn, ninjas, stealing cars.
You know what
this little fucking retard's doing?
Catching fish.
He's got this whole world.
And there's this guy on a boat
and he's catching fish.
I said, 'How the fuck can you
do the same thing all day long?'
And you know what he said to me?
If didn't catch fish all day...
If didn't catch fish all day...
If didn't catch fish all day,
I'd find a way to kill you.
I swear to fucking God,
that's what he said to me.
Creepy little fuck. I'll find
a fucking hole for him one day.
Why would your son
wanna kill you, Mr Zariakas?
How the fuck would know?
What the fuck is it to you, Dull?
Maybe you can give me
the name of that street
those little
harbour red-asses are on.
The guy at the hotel said
there's only one cop in town
and he's gone away for the weekend,
so I can do whatever the fuck want.
Yeah, there's no law in Plymouth
right now.
Hey, give me that fucking rod.
Come on.
Alright, come on, give it here.
No, it's just a shark.
I don't give a fuck.
Give the rod to me.
I'm gonna cut him loose
and let him ride.
It's a shark.
You said you wanted tuna.
Give me the fucking rod.
Come on, clip me in.
Duke, get the bucket.
What are we looking at?
450 pound great white.
Enough to give you a buzz maybe.
That's what you want, right?
I can do that.
Come on, plug me in, baby.
We gotta attach the reel.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Fuck!
Whoa! Whoa! Hey, give me a hand,
man. Jesus Christ.
Hey, baby!
You see what Daddy caught?
A big fucking shark.
Now, honey, swear tomorrow
I'm gonna get you a big fat tuna.
Or some fucking
heads are gonna roll.
Come on, a kiss for Daddy?
You going out again tomorrow?
Yeah, baby, I got to.
I gotta show these boys.
They're all set up
for fucking sharks.
Tomorrow show 'em how to catch tuna.
Hey, school for you tomorrow,
Captain Dull.
You're the boss.
Fucking' a I'm the boss.
I'm gonna wash my hands, okay?
You pay the guy.
Watch his eyes pop out
of his fucking head.
So, tomorrow.
Pay me another ten, we do
the same thing again tomorrow.
- John...
- We fish, we come back.
You spent one day with him.
I have had ten years.
Karen, you got the money.
Go to Europe. Go anywhere.
Just keep that fucking animal
away from my son.
And have him hunt us?
Him? Come on.
Honey, fucking blood everywhere here!
John...
The ten million is dirty money.
It's in cash. It's yours.
Okay, John, you want the truth?
Your son wants you to do it.
This is his idea.
You're his father.
He needs you to do this.
He wants justice.
Baby, come on, let's go up the hotel
and get a cocktail.
Early to bed for you boys.
School tomorrow.
Tuna. T-U-N-A.
Talk to me about temptation.
I know you, Dill.
The way you looked at him.
The way you looked at her.
You knew her before.
Yeah. More than that.
What happened?
I went away to war.
War fucked me up.
I came back and she was with him.
Except I didn't really ever
come back.
What about that kid
he was talking about?
You know, Duke,
you remember when hired you,
I made rules
about discussing the past.
I'm not talking about the past.
I'm talking about today, on deck.
I've spent so long on boats with you,
I can hear you thinking.
So that 'kid from a previous
fuck-up' is yours?
And how much did she offer you
to kill her husband?
Who's crazy now, huh?
Dill, even if that bastard
deserves it.
Even if Lieutenant Gonzalez
won't raise a finger.
There's right and wrong,
heaven and hell.
You know, Duke,
you made two grand today.
I think it's best
you go find someplace safe to put it.
What about tomorrow?
What about tomorrow?
This will blow over by morning.
You know it.
So tell me about tomorrow.
Am I hired to come along
or are you going out with him alone?
I'll sleep on it.
I doubt you'll sleep.
There is a God, Dill.
And you're a good man.
Catch the fish in your head.
That is the rule.
Do not kill the man.
<i>You fucking hear me?
Sit the fuck down.</i>
<i>Dad!</i>
My poor sweet kitty.
What are you doing here?
He went looking
around the commercial harbour.
John?
All these years
I never stopped thinking about you.
Look.
You put it on my finger
when was 16. You remember?
Outside the Fix in the parking lot.
I kept it. It's the same one. Brass.
You took it from the burner
on the stove of your dad's boat.
No. That's just some old ring
you found.
No.
You said, 'With this stupid ring,
I thee wed, baby.'
I remember it word for word.
And then you laughed.
I kept it.
I wear it when I'm alone.
You remember that night?
We went to the bridge.
You were fishing.
Eels and jacks.
Then... you said
I was finally old enough.
First time for me.
First time ever.
If we could go back
to that bridge that night,
would you go?
What do you mean? No war. No fuck-up.
No body parts
laying around in the sand.
My arms, my fucking hands. John.
I loved you even after you were gone.
Listen up. Before this gets
any crazier, here's the deal.
I will take him out tomorrow.
He will drink.
He will fall overboard.
Sharks will get to eat
and I will get ten million in cash.
Afterwards will go somewhere,
you will bring my son to me
and then we'll see what happens.
But don't you bullshit me about love.
I'm doing this for him,
Patrick, my son.
You and me are not part of the deal.
Okay. Okay.
People don't change.
Then I'm still the girl
at the bridge.
We're both destroyed, right?
Both damaged.
Both damaged in different places.
That's it.
I beat him. I win.
Make sure you don't get him there
till noon tomorrow.
I'll take him out on the ebb.
When the water's high, I'll do it.
Then the current will take away
what the sharks leave behind.
Your mother says you can hear me
when talk to you.
How can that be, huh?
It makes no sense.
Because you never know with her.
Opportunity's all around her.
It pours off her like rain.
We're gonna do this,
just you and me, tomorrow. Yeah.
Then maybe you can open the
goddamn curtains and step outside.
Mr Dill.
It's quite a bit unpleasant out here.
Can we go inside?
My name is Reid Miller.
From Fontaine.
The boat
and fishing tackle suppliers.
I am a technical representative
and head of regional sales
in the latitudes
that include Plymouth.
May come in and talk to you?
It's 2: 30 in the morning.
You're out at sea mostly.
I keep missing you.
By a bigger margin every time.
But with the storm
keeping you ashore,
I thought I'd take my opportunity.
What I have in my hands
may change your life
and give you the one thing
you've always wanted.
That sounds great, Reid, but
I've got kind of a big day tomorrow.
Yes, Mr Dill.
I know all about your big day.
And I think you should hear
what I have to say.
Have a seat.
Can I get you something?
- Bigger hands.
- What's that?
Bigger hands.
Whenever I'm around fishermen,
I wish I had bigger hands.
Now, listen, man,
what the fuck do you want?
Mr Dill, inside this suitcase...
Don't tell me you're gonna
try and sell me fishing tackle.
Yes. Yes, I am.
At 2:30 in the morning?
As I say, you're often at sea.
The electrical storm
is my only opportunity.
Now, listen. I'm a man
who can appreciate persistence.
With me it's a fish.
With me it's you.
Okay.
Here's what you're gonna do, little man.
I'm gonna pour you a nip,
gonna keep the cold off of you.
Then you're gonna get the fuck out of
here and go back where you came from.
I got an early start in the morning.
Actually, tomorrow
you don't sail until midday.
That is to say, low tide is noon,
and as a rule you sail at low tide.
You know a lot about me, don't you?
Yes. Almost everything.
Drink up.
What's in the case?
This, Mr Dill...
is the all-new Fontaine
marine sonic fish finder.
A fish finder?
It uses sub aquatic sonar signals.
I know what a fucking fish finder is.
But, Mr Dill...
Let me see that card again.
Is this a joke?
The guys at the Rope put you up to this?
It's no joke. We are prepared
to give you this model,
the Fontaine White Wave,
free of charge for one week.
A trial.
Perhaps you could
try it out tomorrow.
What's so special about tomorrow?
Mr Dill, all I can say is
I am a representative of Fontaine
and they really want you
to catch the fish.
And I want you to take
this piece of equipment on trial.
Just take the fish finder and try it,
and it will work, promise you.
I am the rules.
You're the what?
Those are the rules.
You said you knew something
about tomorrow.
What do you know?
Mr Dill, please just decide
to catch the fish.
Don't kill that man.
Don't what?
I really shouldn't drink.
I can't say any more. I have to go.
Who the fuck are you?
You're gonna tell me
what you know about tomorrow,
and if you don't,
you're not gonna see it.
Mr Dill, if you have to kill me,
then kill me,
but I am just playing my part
in the game.
What game? What fucking game?
This game.
Don't you get it?
Someone made the whole thing up.
<i>Fucking me.
You and the fucking kid.</i>
All of this.
Plymouth Island is a game.
There are lots of games
on Plymouth Island.
Catch the cat. Count the sprats.
You get logs
and frigate birds and fish finders
and bottles of rum.
You see, someone made a world
on their computer
so they could play games.
But his favourite has always been
catch the tuna.
The lighthouse.
Light, dark, one, zero.
The fundamental process.
The rule is you've got to catch
a particular fish.
That rule is your compulsion,
and your compulsion
is a rule in a game.
But now it seems
the fish is no longer the point.
The new game is that you kill a man.
I don't know who the fuck you are,
but it's time for you to leave.
Who the fuck I am is am the rules.
And according to the rules,
on Plymouth Island, no one dies.
It isn't meant to be
that kind of game.
So, as a representative
of the existing programme,
my question is, the big question is,
why has the creator
changed the rules?
<i>Unless you've been living
under a rock,</i>
<i>I think I hardly need to motivate</i>
<i>machine learning and neural networks
to the present...</i>
<i>We have these complex systems
of information relay points</i>
<i>and from that,
consciousness naturally arises.</i>
<i>Good morning.</i>
<i>This is Plymouth Radio,</i>
<i>broadcasting to Plymouth Island
and the ocean.</i>
<i>Well, the storm's blown over.</i>
<i>Where the hell
did that come from, right?</i>
<i>Anyway, I would give you the time,
but you don't care what time it is.</i>
<i>This is Plymouth...</i>
Alright, Patrick.
I'm gonna kill a man today.
That's what you want, right?
I've just got so many holes
in my memory.
I don't know what they're from.
The war, the rum.
I mean, I don't even remember
how the hell I got here.
But I remember you.
You were three years old.
We went fishing.
We didn't catch a damn thing.
And I remember I got so mad.
Maybe that's why
you made me like I am, huh?
Mad as hell to catch that damn fish.
Yeah, but lately I've been having
this thing in my memory where I...
where I see myself...
laying dead in the sand.
Mr Dill?
Remember me?
Samson.
Constance's kid.
My mom said you had a job for me.
I quit my job pumping gas in Miami.
Here I am.
Are you okay, Mr Dill?
You did always say
I was good around the boat.
No. I said you were the lucky one.
The lucky kid.
I always thought if got you aboard,
I might catch him.
The beast? The big one?
Yeah, always asked the game
to bring you to me,
and now look at this,
out of the blue... here you are.
You don't look so good, Mr Dill.
I had kind of a strange night.
At the old Rope, right?
You sank a few, huh?
I bought some lures
I picked up in Boca Raton.
I don't need a man today, Samson.
He changed the rules.
He wants me to do it,
I'm gonna do it.
That's it.
But, Mr Dill, please.
<i>Perfect day to get out on the ocean,</i>
<i>today's low tide at noon and 25,
high tide 2100,</i>
<i>set fair for a beautiful
Plymouth day.</i>
<i>So just get out there
and catch that damn fish.</i>
Yeah, come on, you son of a bitch.
Come on. Come on.
Okay, here we go.
Baker Dill. Come on in.
I got something for you.
Yeah? What you got?
It's a surprise.
The latest thing.
Specimen tuna lures
that wriggle like a bitch.
The latest thing on the Grand Banks.
Never fail.
I got tired of seeing your damn face
so disappointed all the time.
So I spoke to the representative
from Fontaine.
The skinny guy?
It's alright, Dill.
I know times are hard.
You can have those free of charge.
He's kind of a strange guy, right?
He gave them to me for free.
A free trial.
Yeah, he...
he knew a lot about me.
- Who?
- How do you explain that?
Explain what?
Say, Lois, you know how in Plymouth
they like to say
everybody knows everything?
Now, wouldn't it be funny if the
truth was that nobody knows anything?
Like where exactly it is that we are.
Where in the world are we, Lois?
Dill, well, you have yourself a good
day, now, and do what's right, okay?
Yeah, and what's that?
Go catch that fish, Dill.
<i>Fontaine Boat & Fishing
Tackle Suppliers.</i>
Hi, yes. I'm calling about
a Mr Reid Miller.
He's a technical representative
with your company.
He tried to sell me
a fish finder last night.
I was just checking,
he works for you, right? He's real?
<i>Real? Yes, sir. Why do you ask?</i>
And Fontaine Boat & Fishing
Tackle Suppliers,
that's what you do, you're real?
<i>Why, yes, sir.</i>
Great. Well, listen, I'd like
to leave Mr Miller a message.
<i>Certainly. Can take your name?</i>
He'll know who I am.
<i>Sir, there are rules here.</i>
My message is, 'thank you'.
<i>I cannot leave Mr Miller a message
unless take your...</i>
Hey, Dill.
Weather blew over just in time.
Got your ice and beers
ready for you.
I Won't need ice and beer today,
Jack, just a bottle of rum.
You got customers today?
I thought you had rules
about taking strong liquor on board.
Well, the rules have changed.
You know, Dill,
if you goona catch Old Justice,
maybe you should go out alone.
Tourists just get under your feet.
Now, why would you say that, Jack?
What's that?
- Do you even know?
- Know what?
Why you say things. Do you even know
what this is all about?
No, it's just me going crazy, right?
Probably need to see Doctor Bob.
Oh, yeah. It'll do that okay.
Exactly how many years
have I been here, Jack?
What's that?
How long have I been
on Plymouth island?
Sometimes it feels like
we've all been here forever, right?
Yeah.
I'll get you that bottle of rum.
I got a feeling today's the day.
Yeah, today's the day alright.
<i>Don't. Don't you dare.
You come back here.</i>
<i>I'm sorry, Frank. I'm sorry.
Come back here, you bitch.</i>
<i>I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</i>
<i>You shut the fuck up, bitch.
Shut the fuck up.</i>
<i>I swear to God,
I will find a fucking hole for you.</i>
<i>Mom!</i>
No, Duke. I'm going out alone today.
Yeah. Alone is right.
You will be alone because
Mr Zariakas won't be showing up.
Frank?
I made some arrangements.
He won't be coming.
What arrangements?
What happened?
I cracked my rib. I don't feel so good.
I used my two thousand dollars
to pay some Argentinian cannery guy
to break his hand.
You fucking what?
There was fucking six of them
against me.
- Fuck.
- You what?
I didn't do it to save him.
I did it to save you.
No. No, Duke.
No, you didn't fucking do that.
You know, I don't think
there's gonna be any sport for me
for a while, baby.
Deliver me from temptation.'
That's what you said.
And that's what I've done.
You should go see Doctor Bob.
Get the fuck off my boat.
You should see someone.
Get off my boat!
Oh, fuck.
I quit!
Jack?
Jack!
Give me a bottle of rum.
I already gave you a bottle.
No, already drank that bottle.
Give me a goddamn bottle.
You're sitting in old Wes's seat.
That's right, Jack. Right here.
What happened? You don't drink
before you go out, Dill.
That's because I'm not going out.
Why not?
You want something to eat?
I got ham and eggs.
Okay, Dill,
here is how we all see it.
Three days ago
you pull a knife on some tourists,
yell bad things at Duke.
Joe at the cannery says he sees you
running naked in the mornings.
Last night everybody saw you
sitting on the deck in the rain
talking to the air.
And whether you like it or not,
I'm calling Doctor Bob, okay?
You're a part of it, Jack,
and you don't even know it.
This whole goddamn island's
a part of it.
But nobody knows it.
You wanna go call Doctor Bob?
Go do that.
<i>Okay, this is a message
for Baker Dill</i>
<i>from all your friends
on Plymouth Island:</i>
<i>Come back, man.
You've got a fish to catch.'</i>
I'm so mad about this.
Oh, no, baby.
They got what was coming to them.
I so wanted my daddy
to catch me a big fish today.
I spent so long planning this.
All those nights on the internet.
I know. I know.
I'm so sad my dream's
not gonna come true.
I know, baby, but I'm...
I'm hurt pretty bad, baby.
Okay.
Okay.
I want you to pretend
that my throat
is your big old fishing rod.
Baby, my hand is broke. See?
Ah, baby...
See if you can hold it. Just see.
I can't. My hand's broke, baby.
Just try, Daddy. Just try.
I can't.
Oh, yes, Daddy, I feel that.
That is so strong.
They can't stop you.
Nobody can stop you.
You know, if you wanted to go,
I'd come with you.
I'd help you.
- You would?
- Yeah.
How the fuck did you know I was here?
Come on. In Plymouth
everybody knows everything.
Yeah.
Except what the fuck is going on.
If it helps,
I don't much know either.
I just kind of know
what's supposed to happen.
Yeah. Well, if it helps,
I called your office.
They said you are real.
That's very kind of them.
Did you ask them what 'real' means?
No, I didn't have enough coins
to get into that conversation.
- Fuck.
- What's funny?
What's not funny, huh?
Like your theory on my own existence.
It's very interesting.
Intellectually challenging.
But, I mean,
I gotta favour the notion
that I've just been
on this island too long,
I had so much bad fucking rum,
I lost my grease.
No. You're not crazy.
- No?
- No.
Well, if someone invented me,
how come I know who I am?
You don't.
You don't.
We are such stuff
as dreams are made on.'.
So, in short, nobody knows anything.
Nobody except whoever created us.
And who's that?
You know, don't you?
Know what?
Who the creator is.
If this is a game...
then guess I do.
Everything is a guess.
Every wave that breaks is a guess.
Come on, who is it?
It's a boy...
sitting in a dark room.
In some other part of the house he
can hear some guy beating his mother.
So he sits
in front of his computer screen
wishing he could bring his dad back
so he could kill the son of a bitch.
There it is.
That's it.
So that's the new game.
Your new compulsion.
Yeah.
Real, not real, I don't give a fuck.
He wants me to do it, he needs me
to do it, I'm gonna do it.
It's called 'Justice',
or something like that. I'm doing it.
Well, if that's the new rule,
I should help you.
Fuck fish finders, right?
Consuela told Lois who told me,
in spite of all the obstacles
that have been thrown in her way,
Karen has persuaded Zariakas
to be on the boat at noon.
If the game is to kill him,
you don't have much time.
Here we go. Come on, baby.
That's right.
I'm the rules. I am the rules, huh?
Gonna show you how it's done, son.
Just like Iraq. That was a game, huh?
Shoot-'em-up game.
I was good at that game, huh?
That's right. I was put to good use.
They call it justice, huh?
Here we go.
I gave him medication
and bandaged his hand.
He's been drinking rum.
He's been throwing up.
So let's get him on board
before he changes his mind.
This is fate, John.
He's so broken up, he can't fight back.
Stay calm, Karen. I got this.
Does he have a gun?
No. I mean, yeah, but I hid it.
It's fate, John.
How are we doing, boss man?
- What's that?
- Hey.
So do you want
something cold to drink?
The tide's gonna be turning soon.
We should get on board
if we're gonna do this.
He's badly wounded.
Just get him on board.
He wants to fish.
Hey, you wanna fish, right?
Fucking... Fucking show
fucking Captain Dull here.
There we go. Let's do this.
On three. One, two, three.
Motherfuck!
You got it. Easy does it.
Have a seat right here
in the king's chair.
Get some rum in him.
All he can handle.
There you go, Daddy.
You did it, Daddy. You did it.
That's good.
You did it.
Oh, creator of this Garden of Eden,
please understand he's a good soul
whose mind has been disturbed
by temptation.
<i>Come back here, you bitch.
I haven't fucking finished yet.</i>
Mrs. Zariakas, please put
the fighting jacket on your husband.
Okay, give me your hand.
Okay. Can you sit up? Oh, yeah.
When that fucking fish bites, you be
sure to put that rod in my good hand,
okay, Mr Dull?
Hey, you're the boss.
Oh, yeah. Make sure
he gives the fucking rod to me, yeah?
Yes. To me. Yes what?
- Yes, Daddy.
- Yeah.
You fucking hear that, Dull?
She likes to call me Daddy.
Yeah, hear it.
How about your boy?
He call you Daddy too?
What's that?
The creepy one. Patrick.
He call you Daddy?
John, stay cool.
What'd you call him?
Alright, we got blood in the water.
Sharks are gonna come, my man.
Yeah, but we're after
the fucking tuna, though, yeah?
Goddam right we're going after tuna.
When the time's right,
we're gonna fucking do it.
Do what?
<i>I swear to fucking God,
look what you did to me.</i>
<i>Not the face. Not my face.
You fucking happy now?</i>
<i>I bend over fucking
backwards for you.</i>
We catch the famous fish, of course.
Hey, Mr. Dill.
Figured it was last night's rum talking
when you said you didn't need me.
I stowed away.
But I'm here to help.
Oh, fuck.
I wanna show you I am lucky.
John, who the hell is this?
I just... I thought
I'd bring you some luck.
John?
What the fuck
you keep calling him John for?
Mr Dill, I'm sorry. I didn't know.
I thought you'd be fine with...
- You don't have to pay me.
- No, it's okay, Samson. It's okay.
Listen. I want you to go up
to the wheelhouse, tidy up.
When you're done,
fetch me a pack of cigarettes, okay?
- Yes, sir, Captain.
- Okay.
Mr. Zariakas, stay in your seat
and watch the rigs.
Mrs. Zariakas, do you wanna know
where the toilet is?
- Yes.
- Follow me.
Okay, okay, okay. Offer the kid money
to keep his mouth shut, right?
No, no, that's not a good idea.
I'm not doing that to the kid.
What do you propose?
I can't go back to my life, John.
I can't go back to my life.
- No, no.
- Easy. Easy.
Fish on! Bang on the shotgun!
Gunnel! Gunnel! Gunnel!
Fish on.
<i>Now look what you fucking made me do.</i>
Jesus Christ. It's him.
What do you mean, it's him?
It's Justice.
<i>You shut the fuck up.
One more fucking...</i>
Samson? It's him.
It's him? I knew it.
I knew I'd bring you luck.
Hold her steady.
Are you fucking nuts?
Give that line to me.
- Come on.
- You're mine now.
You're fucking mine, baby.
Are you seriously
going to catch a fish? Now?
No.
He is.
<i>This time I'm gonna fucking do it.</i>
Daddy, do you wanna take the rod?
Yeah. Yeah, give me that fucking rod.
Samson, the paying customer
has insisted
that I transfer the rod to him.
Okay, Mr Dill.
Are you sure you can handle
this beast? You man enough?
Because let me tell you,
this motherfucker is the beast.
Give it here. Put it in my left hand.
Here we go.
Give me the fucking rod.
Here we go. Clip me in.
Six feet under,
you and the fucking kid.
<i>You hear me?
I will fucking bury you.</i>
Woah, man.
Big enough to have
his own fucking name.
Yeah.
Now, the question is,
do you want him?
Don't let go, baby. Don't let go.
He's yours now.
And you're his.
Man overboard!
Patrick!
<i>In the Pompano Beach area
of Miami last night,</i>
<i>police responding to a 911 call</i>
<i>arrested a 13-year
old juvenile, Patrick Zariakas,</i>
<i>on a charge of second-degree murder.</i>
<i>The boy's stepfather, Frank Zariakas,
a construction worker,</i>
<i>was found with a single knife wound
to the chest.</i>
<i>Patrick's mother, Karen Zariakas,
claimed she and her son</i>
<i>had been the victims
of domestic violence for many years.</i>
<i>She claims
Patrick acted in self-defence</i>
<i>and to protect his mother
during a drunken assault.</i>
<i>Lindsey Carillo has more.</i>
<i>I'm outside the Rosemont High School
in Plymouth Boulevard</i>
<i>where Patrick's Principal,
Dillon Baker, has issued a statement</i>
<i>describing Patrick
as a gifted IT student</i>
<i>living in a troubled environment</i>
<i>who had withdrawn into a world
he created on his computer.</i>
<i>We have also learned
that Patrick Zariakas's real father,</i>
<i>Captain John Mason,</i>
<i>was killed in action in 2006
while fighting in Ramadi, Iraq.</i>
<i>He was posthumously awarded
the Purple Heart for gallantry.</i>
So... it's done.
I was telling the truth
when I said I love you.
And Patrick loves you.
And you love him.
Somewhere you will find him.
Yeah, somewhere.
Where?
<i>Police tell us that Patrick will
undergo a detention risk assessment</i>
<i>and due to
the mitigating circumstances</i>
<i>will be released
into the custody of his mother.</i>
<i>We understand that so far</i>
<i>he has yet to speak to anyone
about what happened.</i>
Hello?
<i>Dad? It's Patrick. Is that you?
Can you hear me?</i>
Yeah, buddy. It's Dad. It's Dad.
<i>Dad, I just wanna know, are you okay?
What happened?</i>
I don't know.
I don't know what happened.
I don't know anything, you know.
Nobody knows anything.
You know, all I know is that
there's a you and a me somewhere.
<i>Dad, I... did something real bad.</i>
I know, I know. It's okay. It's okay.
You did the right thing.
You hear me? Sometimes we do...
we do bad things for good reasons.
<i>Dad, I'm gonna change the game
so I can come visit you sometime.</i>
<i>Is that okay?</i> I'm here, alright?
Come see me. Come see me.
We'll meet at the Serenity.
We can go somewhere,
anywhere we want.
<i>Yeah, we'll go somewhere.</i> Yeah?
<i>- We'll go fishing.</i>
- Okay.
<i>I'll meet you at the boat.</i>
<i>I'm gonna change the game.</i>
<i>There's a you and a me somewhere.</i>
