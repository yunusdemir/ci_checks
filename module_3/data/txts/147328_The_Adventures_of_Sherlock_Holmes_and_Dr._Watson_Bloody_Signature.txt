The most insidious
and cruel murder,
that a criminal mind could possibly
create at the end of the XIX century,
was prevented.
Deliberate criminal had fallen
a victim to his own intrigues:
He was bitten
by venomous snake.
Sherlock Holmes
and Doctor Watson came back
to 221-B, Baker-street.

BAKER STREET
- What are you doing?
- Shooting. Don't you see?
What an odd way to decorate the
room with the Queen's monogram.
I'm bored, Watson.
My god, you've
smoked a lot.
And you've ruined the wall.
What will you tell the
landlady?
I won't tell her anything. I'll
disguise the hole with a rug.
- You will give me the rug,
won't you? - No, I won't.
Watson, stop being sore with
me.
You lost your billiard-game and
you wreak your vexation on me.
Two holes are definitely
missing here.
Mr. Holmes, the armorer
said
he will have 38-caliber bullets
only on Tuesday.
We'll wait until Tuesday.
There's not much we can do.
You call that criminal
chronicle!
A baker beat up his apprentice
with a rolling-pin.
A drunken sailor broke
a glass window.
A pocket-thief caught in a bus
during an unsuccessful attempt
to steal someone's cash.
Mind you, Watson,
unsuccessful!
They can no longer accomplish
even the simplest things.
No, the criminal world is
definitely degenerating.
- One can only be thankful.
- Yes. As an honest philistine,
a loyal servant of her Majesty
I am thankful.
But as a detective!
How did you know
I played billiards?
Simple deduction.
You could have easily guessed.
There's chalk on your hand.
You're not a tailor, not a
school-teacher.
Why the chalk then?
Deduction: You played the
billiards. If you had won,
you would come home in
a good mood.
That's right.
And very simple...
After you explained it to me.
Today's your turn to
play white.
Please.
Check.
You must learn to make
logical conclusions.
Things can say more about people
than people about things.
A beautiful paradox.
But there are things that have
no face. That look the same.
Take my watch for instance.
I've had it for a year
already.
Well?
What can you say?
There's not much I can
say about you.
That you're a pedant and
you clean it regularly.
That all?
About you - yes.
But it did tell me something
about your elder brother.
The watch belonged to your
father, then it went
into possession of your
elder brother.
That's a simple one.
There's "G.W." engraved
on it.
Only the surname coincides,
that means it is not mine.
You knew my father had long
passed away,
and I've told you I had it
for only a year.
That means my father left
it to my elder brother.
And he...
then gave it to me.
Watson, you're making
amazing progress.
Thank you for the compliment.
But I expected you to say
something
about my brother's character,
his habits, about...
what kind of person he was.
You'd like that?
Very well.
Your brother was a disorderly
light-minded man,
a drunk.
He inherited a fair amount of
money, but wasted it all.
However at times fortune
was king to him.
Finally he ruined himself
and died.
I don't know who told you the
life story of my poor brother,
but it is not a subject for
jokes.
I shouldn't have interfered
with your family matters.
I didn't know my guess
would be so precise.
I assure you, the watch told
me all that.
I didn't explain the logical
chain of deductions to you
and offered the conclusion.
That's why you don't believe me.
Please let me explain.
You see these numbers
scribbled with a needle?
You know what they are?
Numbers of receipts.
That's what they do in all
pawn-shops to avoid confusion.
Your brother pawned the watch
4 times. But he bought it out,
otherwise you wouldn't
have it.
Now look at the key-hole.
It has tiny scratches all
over it.
People usually wind watches
in the morning,
and in the morning his hands
were shaking.
And that happens to people
who drink very much.
And finally the fact, that
now you have it,
says to me that your brother
died.
You're right, Holmes.
Right as usual.
I'm sorry I offended you
with mistrust.
That's nothing.
Checkmate.
What are you planning
on doing now?
I'll go study pharmacology.
Everyone has something to do.
If you only knew how I hate
days like this?
Even the most brilliant mind
gets rusty without work.
Watson, how about some
deduction training?
Come here.
See that gentleman?
What can you say about him?
Well... he's a Londoner,
goes his usual way.
- Doesn't look around.
- Logical.
A well-off man with
good appetite.
- You can tell by the clothes
and the paunch. - Bravo.
That's about it.
I can add something else.
He's 48, married, has a son,
loves his dog - a red setter -
and works at the Foreign
Ministry.
After the story with the watch
I can believe your every word.
But how, goddammit?!
Elementary, my dear Watson.
You see, this man happens to be
my brother, Mycroft Holmes.
You pulled my leg, Holmes.
But I asked for it. I shouldn't
be so credulous.
But seriously, Holmes.
There goes a man,
ordinary looking.
The one who crosses the street.
What can you say about him?
- The retired navy sergeant?
- Retired sergeant, eh?!
He must be your brother too.
Have mercy on me, Holmes.
You know I can't check that,
and you play jokes on me.
There's a man to see you. Looks
like a retired sergeant.
Please, come in, sir.
There's a letter for Mr. Holmes.
Please.
If I may ask, have you ever
served with the navy sir?
- I have, sir.
- In what rank?
Sergeant of the
Royal Marine Corps, sir.
Thank you.
- How did you know?
- Know what?
That he was a sergeant and
served in the navy?
Oh that... It's a long story,
not worth wasting our time.
A very interesting letter.
Mrs. Hudson.
How did you know the messenger
was a retired sergeant?
I really don't know.
He had a picture of a blue
anchor on the back of his hand.
- A tattoo.
- That's right, a tattoo.
So I figured he was a sailor.
Side-whiskers trimmed in a
military fashion.
So I thought - navy sailor.
Conducts himself with dignity,
but doesn't look like an officer
- So I...
- Thank you, Mrs. Hudson.
Watson!
Here, read this.
"Dear Mr. Holmes,
Tonight in an abandoned house
on Brixton Road
our police officer found a dead
man's body.
No signs of violence.
But drops of blood could be
seen near the body.
Knowing that you like riddles
like that I invite you to take
part in the investigation.
With respect. Tobias Gregson."
The most intelligent detective
in all Scotland-Yard.
They have this guy Lestrade,
but he's like a fox-terrier,
Abundance of energy and very
little intellect.
You know, I was too soon to
get disappointed.
There'll still be enough crimes
for our lifetime.
What do you make of that
letter?
Me either. We're going to
Brixton Road.
Good day.
Inspector Gregson here?
I'm Sherlock Holmes.
He's with me.
Not bad.
Now we can go into the house.
I'm glad you came.
No one touched anything.
Everything's kept the way it was
Except the path to the
entrance.
As if a herd of bisons trampled
down on it.
I hope you had a chance to
examine it before that.
There was so much I had to do
inside the house.
Besides, frankly I didn't give
it too much thought.
There he is, sir.
Find anything in his pockets?
A gold watch with a chain,
a golden tie-pin.
A wallet with business-cards
in the name of a mister
E. Drebber from Cleveland.
- An American, that's what I
thought. - Me too.
Money. 7 pounds 30 shillings.
There. 2 letters.
One addressed to E. Drebber, the
other to Joseph Stangerson.
Both letters are from the
steamship company.
- Regarding tickets to New-York.
- You try to find Stangerson?
Yes, of course.
Sit, Toby!
Good day, inspector
Lestrade.
May I introduce Dr. Watson,
my assistant.
How did you get here,
Mr. Holmes?
- Gregson invited me. - That
wasn't necessary, Gregson.
I am investigating this case
and I don't need assistants.
Maybe you need a chief?
What I definitely don't need
is your stupid jokes.
Please proceed.
Gregson!
Letters...
Since you're here anyway,
try not to get in the way.
Watson!
This is interesting.
"Revenge". A murder then?
Written in blood.
- You sure there are no wounds?
- Not a scratch.
The blood is fresh.
Watson!
And this is even more
interesting.
- Allow me.
- This was under his left leg.
It slipped off Drebber's finger
when he struggled with the
killer. Gregson, put it on the
inventory list.
It would be too small even
for his little finger.
All right...
Then...
It must have belonged to
the killer.
Now we know:
The murderer was short
and had small hands!
- Wrong.
- What?
If you're interested,
you can write down the
description of the murderer.
The murderer...
is a fairly young man.
A little...
shorter than me.
Wears heavy boots,
smokes charuta,
black American cigarettes.
He came here in a two-wheeled
cart together with his victim.
The horse had 3 old horseshoes,
1 new on the front right leg.
Possibly the murderer's
face is red.
A trifle, but perhaps it can
help us.
Mr. Holmes, I don't know how
you do these tricks of yours,
you won't tell me anyway.
All right, how did he kill
Drebber?
- Maybe you know that too?
- I do. He used poison.
Fast-acting poison.
Sorry, sir. I beg your pardon,
there's something wrong here.
Wives put poison
in their husbands' coffee.
Or they put it in old people's
drops to inherit the property.
But here, at night!
In an abandoned house!
How could he have poisoned
this Drebber?
The house stood empty
for 3 years.
But today, when patrolling, I
saw light in one of the windows.
I found that suspicious and
decided to go see what it was.
- I go in and I see...
- Wait a minute, Res.
You didn't go right in. Why
did you go back to the gate?
- How did you know?
- Isn't that so?
It is.
How should I explain it?
You see, I'm not afraid of
anyone who walks on the ground.
Underneath - is a different
matter.
3 years ago a tenant hanged
himself in this house.
Well, I thought, what if it's
him wandering around?
I went back to the gate. Thought
I'd wait for my partner.
But then I decided to go in.
I come in and I see...
We know what you saw.
What did you do next?
I ran outside and blew my
whistle, and my partner came.
- Was there anyone near the
house? - Nearly no one.
A drunkard was leaning against
the fence bawling a song.
I was going to take him to the
station, but we were busy.
- What did he look like?
- The usual way.
He was drunk stiff,
dressed in a brown coat.
A bit shorter than you,
with a red face.
Remember, Res, a policeman's
head is not just for
wearing the cap.
Yesterday you could earn
a sergeant's stripes.
You were looking at the killer,
but you didn't take him in.
Still I don't understand many
things about this case.
Where did the blood on the
floor come from?
And then, why didn't the
murderer run away,
but waited near the house
until the police arrived?
I can answer that. He came
back for the ring.
When he saw the policemen, he
pretended to be drunk.
And, Watson,
this ring will be very
useful to us.
We can use it as bait to
catch fish...
Just like they use sprat to
catch pike.
I suggest we sleep on it.
Good night.
Good night.
(Plays the violin)
The killer watched you from the
moment you went into the house.
He hit you on the head, searched
your pockets but didn't take
anything. Not even your gun.
How did you get here?
You were asking questions all
evening, and at night,
when I didn't hear you
snoring -
I'm sorry, but you do have that
little habit -
I figured you decided to try
yourself as a detective.
He was going to come back for
the ring. I thought of an ambush
myself, but decided that
that would scare him away.
As a detective you were
unprofessional
and too self-assured, that's why
he attacked you first.
- How do you feel?
- Like a complete idiot.
Don't lose heart, Watson.
A terrible crime on Brixton
Road.
They killed an American.
Thank god, inspector Lestrade
is handling the case.
The papers write he's the best.
Inspector Lestrade is a
complacent fool!
It's what the "Times" writes.
Anything interesting in the
ads column?
Today on Brixton Road
a golden wedding ring
was found.
Inquire with Doctor...
Watson?
221 B, Baker Street,
5 p.m. To 7 p.m.
- Doctor Watson?
- I'll pretend to be Watson.
You don't mind, do you?
Of course not.
- Where will you get the ring?
- Borrow it from the police.
- Good day.
- Good day.
Inspector, would you give me
the ring for a couple of days?
Ask Gregson. I have nothing
against that.
If you lose it, he will be
responsible.
Mr. Holmes, I don't know what
you're after,
but I want to give you some
advice.
Good day.
Stop playing children's
games.
While you search around dumps
with your magnifier...
us, ordinary sleuths
have already come onto
something.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
But we are not giving away
our secrets.
- Yes, Gregson?
- Eh?
- We're not giving away our
secrets? - Oh, no, no.
Mr. Holmes...
we know who killed Drebber.
We haven't found the man yet,
but we know his name.
Yes!
Mr. Holmes, you remember the
letters in Drebber's pocket?
One was addressed to him,
the other...
To Joseph Stangerson.
You remember!
For you it may be just a name,
but I found out who he is.
He was E. Drebber's
personal secretary.
- So?
- What do you mean, "So"?
They were not on very good
terms lately,
the landlady and the neighbors
say, that every night
they heard noises and swearing
in Drebber's apartment.
And what's most important
- threats.
But there's more to it!
When we came to the lodge
to talk to that character,
we found out,
that he'd disappeared. Left
abruptly...
leaving all his belongings
behind.
So the case acquires a new
turn.
We have to find this
Stangerson.
Gregson, you'll be responsible
for the ring.
When he comes,
I'll meet him here.
You hide under the staircase.
If you hear noises run upstairs.
You have the gun with you?
Excellent.
I read your ad in the paper.
I need Doctor Watson.
Yes, please.
Over here, please.
Follow me.
Mr. Watson.
Mr. Watson.
There's a lady to see
you about the ring.
- Is this your ring, madam?
- Yes. Oh my god!
I can't tell you how
grateful I am!
My husband, brigadier-general
Sir Arthur Fitz-Simmons
was killed in India in
the battle for Agra.
Since then I am in mourning.
And this wedding ring...
is the only thing I have
for memory.
He loved me so much! He...
Doctor, a glass of water
please!
Watson!
Sherlock...
Watson, I have to bring
my apologies.
Just recently I laughed at you
and this moron Lestrade,
but now I made a fool of
myself.
- Was it him?
- The murderer? No.
It was his accomplice.
A professional actor.
A very talented actor at
that.
And still I should have figured
him out. The black veil...
Gloves to conceal makeup...
My friend, I was punished
for my arrogance.
Now we will have to give the
ring back to Gregson.
He took the ring?!
- That's right.
- Oh no!
Have you noticed that the
accomplice came here by cab?
And the killer on Brixton
Road also came by cab.
Inspector, Lestrade made ill
prophesies and I lost the ring.
But I promise to return it to
you in two days time.
I hope so. Otherwise I'll have
to pay for it from my salary.
And it's not too big.
But I haven't come for
the ring.
We found the hotel where
Stangerson is staying
under a different name. Lestrade
has the arrest warrant.
You can come with us
if you want to.
If he doesn't open, break down
the door. I go in first.
You cover me.
- You stay here. Where is he?
- Over there.
Keep it quiet.
Gregson, follow me.
Tss! Quiet.
Open it in the name of the
law.
One...
Hands up!
What do you say, doctor?
Stab-wound.
This is Stangerson.
I think we can no longer suspect
him of murder, can we?
Look at this.
It all adds up.
The money's intact.
A watch.
A telegram from Cleveland.
"Beware. J.H. Is in England".
And there's the missing link.
2 pills.
So? Just ordinary pills.
Sleeping or stomach pills.
For him it doesn't matter.
You'd better look here.
Nothing unusual.
Just a ladder.
The murderer climbed up this
ladder and then went down.
Let's go, Watson. There won't be
anything interesting here.
Gentlemen, when you finish here,
drop by our place.
- What for? - We'll have some
sherry and talk.
Good day, gentlemen.
We found him.
Red face, brown coat.
Good work.
Wiggins. These are your new
instructions.
Yes, sir.
And your fee.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
Anything else, gentlemen?
One cigar, sir.
Smoking is bad for your health.
Look how thin I am.
That's because I smoke.
I was sure from the very
beginning that Stangerson
wasn't planning to kill
Drebber.
But when he escaped from
the lodge
in such a hurry, leaving all his
belongings,
I knew that he himself
was afraid of the killer.
If the police had arrested
Stangerson,
that would have saved his
life.
But, alas, they were late
as usual.
I am curious to know what
kind of instruction
you've given your
desperados.
From what I heard they have
traced the murderer.
Don't rush things, Watson.
There are 2 gentlemen
to see you, sir.
One of them is
Mr. Lestrade.
That's for the dog.
The receptionist and the
owner don't know anything.
They haven't seen a thing.
But the little boy, the cook,
was throwing away the slops
and he noticed that the ladder
that was normally lying...
lying on the ground...
Go on, please.
Was leaning against the
window.
Then a man climbed out of the
window and down the ladder.
He was moving slowly and
casually,
and the cook took him for a
painter or a carpenter.
And only later it occurred
to him,
that hardly anyone would
work so early in the morning.
What did this man look like?
Not very tall, wearing heavy
boots and a brown coat.
So?
I'm sure
those were not sleeping pills
or stomach pills,
but fast-acting poison.
But he was stabbed, not
poisoned.
I could do the chemical analysis
of the pills myself,
but I think it will be more
convincing
if they do it in Scotland
Yard.
Oh, Mr. Holmes,
Mr. Holmes...
Take it.
No! Toby!
Toby! Toby!
Spit it out. Toby, where
are you going?
As you can see Scotland Yard
has verified your hypothesis.
To it's health.
But it is alive.
Toby!
- Toby!
- Our lab is always handy.
Mr. Holmes,
after experiments conducted
on animals
they usually proceed
to those with people.
Mr. Holmes, what are
you?
Mr. Holmes, you saw it...
Toby.
Toby.
What's with you?
- Mister Holmes...
- You've been warned.
You have been warned.
There will be no more murders.
It'll be over soon.
The case is complicated and
it may seem illogical at first.
That confused you.
However such intricate
crimes
are most easy to solve.
Stop lecturing us.
If you know where he's
hiding, just tell us.
- You want to know?
- Yes, we'd like to know that.
I'll tell you, only...
- Watson.
- What is it?
I feel sick.
Cabby, stop!
We have to help him.
Easy.
Water.
- Just a minute.
- Help him up.
I want you to meet...
Jefferson Hope.
The man who killed
Drebber and Stangerson.
What?
In a week they're going to
try you in court.
If you want to say something
before that, we're listening.
But we have to warn you that
anything you say now
can be used against you.
He'll talk. We know
how to make them talk.
I've got nothing to hide.
I've done my work, now you
do yours.
So you admit you killed
Drebber
and Joseph Stangerson?
No, that was not murder.
I tried them and I sentenced
them to death.
They told the state authorities
that I threatened them.
I spent 2 months in jail.
When they let me out
I found out that they left
to Europe,
ran away from me.
I saved some money,
boarded a ship
and set out in search of them.
I searched Europe in and out.
There wasn't a place where
I hadn't been.
But a year ago I found out
they were back in London.
I searched all over London in
my cab and finally found them.
Now I waited for the right
moment.
Cab, sir.
- I live near here.
- Take a ride, sir.
- It's not safe to walk around
alone at night.
- Let's go.
- Please.
- Take me to Regent Street.
- Of course, sir.
- That's it, sir. We're here.
- Oh really?
No, not that way. I'll
show you.
Where did you bring me?
This is not my house.
This is not my house.
Do you recognize me?
You...
I can see you do.
You want to kill me?
I could shoot you 10 times,
like a mad dog.
Or stab you and your friend
to death in a dark alley.
But I don't want that.
There are 2 pills here.
One is harmless.
The other contains poison.
Choose one of them.
I'll swallow the other
one.
If there is justice in this
world, you will die.
If there's none,
then I don't want to live
anyway.
I won't take it.
You will.
You pretend to be God, but you
are a common murderer!
I won't...
I won't...
Remember Lucy Ferrier.
10 years ago I had a
fiancée.
We met in Utah, in
Salt Lake City.
The city of Mormons. You
know who Mormons are?
A religious sect.
They're a gang of
perverted fanatics.
They don't abide by our laws
and they only do what their
leaders tell them.
They allow polygamy,
like damned pagans.
So this Drebber
decided he wants to take my
fiancée for his 4th wife.
Lucy Ferrier.
Her father didn't want that
kind of life for his daughter.
They fled, but the Mormons
caught them in the desert.
Drebber's friend Joe Stangerson
shot old Ferrier.
And Lucy...
They dragged her to
Drebber's house by force.
At the time I was in
Nevada.
When I came back and found
out about what happened,
I can't tell you what I felt.
I loved her...
so much.
Lucy was all I had.
I decided to take her away
from that place.
But it was too late. Lucy died
of shame and grief
after one month of living with
that bastard.
Her friend gave me the ring.
I'd given it to her.
It was the last thing he heard:
"Remember Lucy Ferrier".
I got so excited, that blood
streamed out of my nose.
That happens, doctors
say it's plethora.
I dipped my finger in blood and
wrote "Revenge" on the wall.
Not for a second do I regret
what I've done.
Only one thing
overshadowed my joy.
I dropped the ring.
Who was the man who came
to me for the ring?
I won't tell you his name.
You don't need to know it.
I'll say only, he is my friend,
a jobless actor.
He doesn't know about
the murder.
How did you find Stangerson?
You stabbed him, didn't
you?
I can see you remember me.
Do you remember Lucy?
And old Ferrier?
I'll give you all my money.
I have a lot of it.
- Anything you want.
- No.
I haven't come for that.
There are 2 pills here.
One is harmless,
the other one contains poison.
Help!
I felt I was losing my strength
and stabbed him with
a knife.
Anything else you can say?
You know the rest.
A boy ran up to me,
he said a gentleman was sick
and I had to take him home.
That's how I got to know
Sherlock Holmes.
The red face was just a guess.
The footprints on the floor...
matched the boots
and the length of the step
of the killer.
I thought the blood must have
streamed from his nose.
Your guess proved right.
But why did you ask the boy
to look for a cabby?
The killer drove in a cab
and went into the house.
The cab didn't stand put, that
means the cabby was not there.
The horse was moving about.
You could tell that by the
prints of hoofs and wheels.
There were only 2 in the house -
the killer and his victim.
Therefore the killer must
have been the cabby.
A not so tall man in a
brown coat
with a red face.
But there are 4 million
people in London.
And god knows how many
cabbies.
How do you find the right one,
when you know so little?
Watson, I knew his name.
No, it is not a miracle.
I sent a telegram to Cleveland
and got an answer.
They wrote that Drebber
complained about his rival,
a man by the name of
Jefferson Hope.
There was one catch in
this case however,
until I found out one of
the pills was harmless.
But when I found out that the
killer gives his victim
an equal chance...
I somehow felt sorry
for this cruel and merciless,
but at the same time
noble young man.
There's one of the unpleasant
sides of a detective's work.
My job is to solve crimes,
but often the criminal evokes
more sympathy than the victim.
I must admit,
I don't give all the criminals
away to law-enforcement bodies.
Why?
There are certain minor
crimes,
when a person is punished
with the fear of being caught.
And it is a guarantee that
next time he will think twice
before doing something
like that again.
But if you put him to jail,
the jail habits will haunt him
for the rest of his life.
But I'm afraid that doesn't
refer to Jefferson Hope.
He ruined himself with his
own hands.
A man can't be guided with just
the craving for revenge.
It is one of the most useless
feelings, it dries out the soul.
I always felt sorry for
Count Monte Cristo.
What a waste of talent
and money!
The one from the novel? I didn't
read it. And Jefferson Hope...
Tonight Jefferson Hope died
in prison.
- I knew it.
- He killed himself?
It was a stroke.
- Maybe he was lucky.
- What do the papers write?
They praise Gregson,
and more so Lestrade.
And what about you?
Not a word about me, as usual.
What monstrous ingratitude!
As of this day I will start
writing myself.
I shall be your chronicler.
And I won't allow them to
misappropriate your merits.
Yes, they'll read my stories in
all the different languages,
in Austria, in Japan,
in Russia!
If I'll be damned!
