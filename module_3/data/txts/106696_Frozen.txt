Howard?
Howard, dear, are you scared?
There's no need
to be frightened.
The storm can't hurt you.
It... It's not that, Mother.
It's just... tonight's the night
we visit father...
in the bad place.
Oh, Howard.
He's really looking forward
to seeing you.
You're all he has left.
Just hold my hand, Howard.
Everything will be fine.
I don't like this place, Mother.
I know, darling.
I don't, either.
But you know why we've come.
I'm certain your father
will want to see you
on his birthday.
Good evening, Dr. West.
I received your message.
I know there's been
no official change...
but I thought...
my husband could see his son
on his birthday.
Mrs. Lovecraft...
...I wish I could tell you
that seeing his son
would be therapeutic
for your husband, but...
Winfield's mind is... is like
a shattered looking glass.
That's a good one.
Shattered...
looking...
...glass.
But, in all honesty,
I'm more concerned about the harm
it could do to the boy
to see his father in this state.
But haven't the treatments
shown any progress?
Well, don't expect him to tango.
Progress...
is such an inexact term,
Mrs. Lovecraft.
Most assuredly
we have done everything
within medical boundaries to assist.
Even a few things outside
of those...
boundaries, to be honest.
I feel for you.
And the child.
But Winfield is still showing
extreme nervous exhaustion,
and nothing is calming him down.
I cannot advise visitation.
I just...
I was hoping on his birthday
he could actually see his son.
Oh! Why listen to me?
I'm merely a...
highly trained professional
with expert opinions
on the secrets
of life and death.
I don't know...
Whatever am I to do?
Come along,
Mrs. Lovecraft.
Come along.
A little fatherly fear
never hurt anyone.
Ah, I hear a lot of writers
are made that way, in fact.
He's coming.
He's coming!
...King Abdul Alhazred.
He always took care
of everything.
Now I'm just lost.
He's coming.
He's coming.
Father?
He's coming!
He's coming!
He's coming!
- He's coming...
- Father, it's me.
- He's coming.
- It's Howard.
Who's coming?
Abdul Alhazred.
King Abdul.
He's coming.
Father...
Please speak to me.
He's coming.
He's...
Howard!
Father.
Howard! Son!
Listen!
Listen to me!
I made a mistake.
No... I discovered it.
A mistake...
A glorious mistake.
Father, I... I miss you.
I miss you so much.
Listen to me, Son.
Listen! But not to King Abdul.
And not to the words.
Don't ever listen to the words!
Or symbols!
The symbols will speak to you.
But do not listen!
Listen...
...to me!
I saw it.
I heard it.
Should never have been written.
Ever! My mistake.
I never should have.
Howard...
The words...
the symbols...
Do not look!
Do not listen!
Do not read!
Father...
Swear it!
King Abdul.
The Necronomicon.
The words.
The symbols.
They will lead to...
to The Sleeper of R'lyeh.
The Great Old One.
That is not dead
which can eternal lie.
And with strange aeons
even death may die.
Please!
The Necronomicon!
Destroy it, Howard!
Destroy it for my sake!
- For yours!
- No.
What do you think you're doing?
The last remaining...
The Necronomicon
must be destroyed, son.
Hell?!
Orderly!
The symbols must be destroyed!
Before they... destroy us all!
Orderlies!
Swear you'll destroy it!
Cthulhu cannot awake!
Restrain him.
I see the symbols...
...and it's madness.
It's okay, Howard.
Mommy's here.
Madness!
Why did you take him there
in the first place?
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have...
No, Mary, you're right.
I'm gonna have to raise
Howard alone.
Oh, shh, now.
It's all right.
I'll help you, Sarah.
We all will.
I just worry.
He's always been an odd child.
That imagination of his.
It puts off the other children.
Now all he ever does is
sit in his room alone and read.
There's nothing wrong
with Howard loving to read.
It's the only reasonable trait
my nephew left his son.
Must be in the blood because
Winfield was never around.
His incredible curiosity led to
...dark journeys.
Ever since he was boy,
Winfield had a hunger
for knowledge.
He was always reading.
Always exploring.
I don't think he ever took
the same road home twice.
There was always something more
to know.
But it never occurred to me,
such a toll that life
took on him.
The stories that would
come out of his mouth...
grew from strange
to utter madness.
Until...
Well, we must deal
with what's in front of us,
here and now.
But the worrying...
That he gets from you, Sarah.
He's my son, Mary.
And he gets sick so often.
What kind of mother would I be
if I didn't worry?
He's turned a corner, Sarah.
He's much healthier now
than he was.
Things will turn out all right
in the end, dear.
Just give them a chance to.
Howard will be just fine.
You'll see.
I can't sleep.
I know today was difficult,
sweetheart.
But you need to get some sleep.
You're a growing boy.
Your father loves you so much.
Could you tell me a story?
I'm not very good
at telling stories.
I have an idea.
What is it?
This was your father's.
I wasn't sure when I
was gonna give it to you.
It... it's a book.
It's a journal.
He wrote it a long time ago.
Back when he was well.
Before his nervous exhaustion?
Yes.
He told me how he wanted you
to have it.
You're... sure I can read this?
You can read it
until you fall asleep,
if you like.
All right, Mother.
I love you, Howard.
Every inch of my soul
cried out,
pleading with me to leave that place.
But...
I was powerless to leave,
spellbound by the tales
of horrific beings
bent on tearing
our world apart
to make room for their own.
To leave us behind...
like scattered animals...
from the brushfire
...of their madness.
His words were blasphemous,
yet they caressed my senses
in an inexplicably
sensuous fashion,
so that I hung on ever word
as I listened-enrapt-
it was his final words
that awakened me
from my stupor.
"It is all true."
"A place called R'lyeh,
a dour profane kingdom
hidden from the eyes of man.
He described R'lyeh
as an unholy marriage
of fairy tales and nightmares.
The old man said that
he dare not utter the words
that open the doorway
to the mystical place.
He had a look you could call fear,
but it was something deeper.
A crack at the core of him
that leaked darkness
into every expression.
He was genuinely afraid,
but for those of weaker stuff
the excitement
of new horizons to come
would always bring terror.
For his horror only drove me on.
Making me long for the place
even more."
Suddenly emboldened,
I drew my pistol on the old boy.
At the service end of my firearm,
the frightened man
wrote the words
in the creatures'
unsanctified language.
They were...
"Nr' Fga'
Ra' nazen
Flugn..."
Hello?
Am I dreaming?
I... I see something.
What is that?
"Mm?
Wow!
Whoa.
What is this place?
Could this be real?
Easy!
Stand down!
Stand down!
Hey, what did I just say?
Okay.
Okay.
"Mm?
Oh!
Ah!
Hell?!
Can anyone help?
No!
You just tried to kill me.
Wing... broke.
Help Thu.
Don't want fall.
Help, help!
Thu made mistake.
I'm no Pup...
My name is Howard.
Yes, Howard.
Howard strong.
Hell?-
Please!
Do something!
Give me your word
as a-a-a fish thing
that you won't hurt me.
Swear!
Howard, swear.
Here. Give me your... your...
Uh, take my hand!
Eww!
Pull!
Hold on.
I've got your hand-tentacle-thing.
Almost there.
Pull yourself up!
Save life.
You master.
Me, Thu Thu Hmong.
Su Su Hwang?
Thu Thu Hmong.
Su-Su-Sussudio?
Thu... Thu.. Hmong.
I literally have no idea
what you're saying.
I'm gonna call you...
...spot.
Spot
Spot?
Spot
Spot
Master Howard.
Hey! You promised!
Master cold.
Spot makes warm.
Uh, thank you?
I need to get back home.
My mother... and my father
need me.
Is your mom a squid?
Or wait...
She was a dragon, right?
"Mm?
Oh, Sire!
Who nobody wants.
The mighty ruler
of a thousand skies.
I have news.
Go on.
Please, do tell.
Your Majesty, I...
I think he has arrived, Sire.
He?
As in "he" from the prophecy?
Yes, appeared...
in the heart of a storm,
out of nowhere, as if leaped
from the other realm.
Just as the book foretold.
Eh, before the book was lost.
A boy?
You're sure it's a boy?
Oh, positive, Sire.
He's so... so pink.
Where is he now?
He encountered The Sleeping One.
They appeared to be
traveling together.
Good.
But where are they going?
Uh, I don't know, Your Majesty.
You said to announce it
...at once.
If the outlander arrived...
And well, he did.
Uh, so I did.
I did say that.
Well done.
Really?
Yes.
Now, go back out there
and find them.
That shouldn't be too hard
for the likes of you.
Please do keep an eye on guests.
I want to make sure
they arrive here
safe and sound.
At once,
Your Highness.
- Spot?
- Hmmm?
Yes?
Where are we exactly?
R'lyeh
And that's a place?
Is it?
R'lyeh.
Even more helpful
the second time.
Thank you, Spot.
Where Master from?
Oh, well, my home is
Providence, Rhode Island.
That's where I need to go.
Where Providence, Rhode Island?
Um, it's in New England?
New England.
You've never heard of it?
Have heard of it.
Really?
Master said it.
So, you've just heard of it
right now?
Yes.
Really not helpful.
No.
Master here now.
Master safe.
So, uh, any idea how we can get
back to my home?
Friends... close.
Go.
Eat.
Hello?
Hello?
I hope we're not interrupting
anything.
My friend Spot says
you were friends of his.
Friends.
Right.
You call him...
"spotâ€œ?
Well, yeah.
He does have spots on him.
I see.
What do you want?
Spot?
Friends provide Master Howard
food.
'Uh!!!
- Mmm, warm?
I see.
What does that make us?
Favor.
Very well.
Oh, thank you very much.
You're not from here.
No, I... I'm not.
I'm very far from home.
I've forgotten my manners.
I'm Gotha.
And this is my brother Davik.
He doesn't speak.
Do come in.
It's as he says,
it'll be night soon.
It gets very cold.
I would believe that.
What about Spot?
Sorry.
I'm afraid he'll have to
stay outside.
Spot is fine.
Body not get cold.
Well, all right.
If you say so.
Whoa!
Sorry?
Your home.
It's so big in here.
Of course, it is.
Is that strange to you?
Where I'm from...
our buildings are the same size
on the outside and the inside.
Fascinating.
You have dark circles
under your eyes.
- Huh?
- I love food.
Are you Father Dagon?
No.
Oh, I forgot my manners.
How rude of me.
I'm Howard.
Howard Lovecraft.
Wh... What?
Is that okay?
Of course.
Is that a common name
where you're from?
Sure, lots of boys
are named Howard.
I mean Lovecraft.
Oh! No. Just me.
Why?
This is Innes, and this is Twi'i.
Did you know a shoggoth
can crush a penguin?
I love fruit!
But not sticky ones.
Davik, take your sisters,
and you can all go
wash your suckers.
It's almost time for supper.
Forgive us.
We don't get too many visitors.
But you've met someone like me
before?
- Yes.
- Who?
What was he like?
Oh, he was a giddy young man.
And very curious about things.
He talked very quickly
and about a great many things.
He was very keen to explore.
He wanted to see everything.
Do you remember his name?
It was a peculiar sort of name,
like yours.
Not a proper name
like Gotha or Davik.
Warbol... winegrass?
Winfield?
That was it!
That's my father.
My father was here!
So he was.
How curious to meet
two Lovecrafts
on the same path.
When? When did you meet him?
I can't be sure.
The winter has lasted...
so long.
Would your parents know perhaps?
They... haven't been home
in a very long time.
Oh! I'm sorry.
I didn't know.
It's just when you said
you'd seen my father, I...
I got excited.
He's not himself anymore.
Over and up.
Up and over.
Dinner incoming.
I love food!
I hope it's squishy.
Can't quite sit right.
Don't worry.
Winfield had issues
with sitting too.
His legs also bent
in only one direction.
No bending legs?
How do you squiggle around?
Or slime up a wall?
Or squish in a crack
to hide from bad guys?
- Squishing is my favorite.
- Mine too.
It's like squeezing, but...
grosser!
Food time now!
Manners with company.
We thank the meal first.
Everyone has washed
their tentacles?
At least half of them.
One is super-clean.
The other stays dirty,
in case I need to use it
for surprise attacks.
Who are you attacking?
That's a surprise!
I don't know about...
the tentacles,
but my ten fingers
are sparkling.
Because it's... Hands clean.
Then grab hold,
and we'll start the meal.
Thank you, Dark Ones,
and long may you sleep.
Thank you, Small Ones,
and those that we eat.
Take the cold,
bring back the green.
Save us from creatures
evil and mean.
Ferak Ny'har.
Ferak Nahar... wait, what?
Ready.
So ready!
Ready.
Ready for what?
I like it.
Don't worry.
We'll make sure you get some.
It's hard to catch your first try.
You don't get gran
where you're from?
Uh, no.
Not really.
Where I'm from,
we eat green veggies.
And farm animals.
It squishes in my mouth!
Howard, tell us
of these "fahar" animals.
Oh, we keep the bigger animals
in special areas.
We drink their milk,
wear their hides,
and eat their meat.
I'm not sure about the rest.
How destructive
these creatures must be,
that you have to devour them.
Elder Ones forbid
that they ever invade us.
Oh, they're very gentle.
We keep animals as pets too.
We're not supposed to play
with our food.
I name my food.
I should call this next bite
Howard for our guest.
That's very sweet of you, Twi'i.
Yeah.
Flattered.
How is it that I can talk to you?
Did someone teach you English?
Not exactly.
We share what we call a lanaf.
Munch munch.
Food food.
Eat a one.
Then eat a brood.
It kinda means...
"Transmission" would be
the right word.
We can speak without speaking.
It's rather special
that you can do it, really.
Worship me!
Tell your people my power!
Could my father lanite?
<i>Lanai.</i>
Yeah, that.
Could my father do that?
Oh, my! yes-.
His was particularly strong.
He would channel us
from many miles away.
Some nights, I swear,
I can still hear him.
You should try it.
Just focus and listen.
La la, squid!!!-
Well, all of you have been
really nice so far.
So is Spot.
I mean, he was scary at first,
but he...
There are bad things out there,
Howard.
Badder than I know
how to tell you.
R'lyeh has many creatures,
some hidden, some waiting.
All fierce and powerful in ways
that you can't imagine.
That's right, Davik.
Like shoggoth.
He's got a big mouth.
What about night-gaunts?
Don't like them.
All sharp and shadows.
And there's tons of them.
It's okay, twins.
We don't mention his name.
You know that.
He hasn't been seen
for a long, long time.
Nothing to worry about.
So what you're saying is,
stay out of the darkness.
What we're saying is
is this world may look cool
and peaceful,
but you have to be very careful,
Howard.
Your father, he was curious.
He liked to explore,
perhaps he saw too much
of our world.
There are things
that can harm you
in more ways
than you can ever imagine.
If you wake them,
there might never be a chance
of you getting back home.
Well...
I mean, I can be grumpy
when I wake up too.
No, it's more than that, Howard.
The One Who Sleeps, Cthulhu...
The Great Dreamer.
The Sleeper of R'lyeh.
There are ancient creatures here,
Howard.
He is the king of them.
The power you need to go home
may be strong enough
to wake him.
You have to be very careful
in your travels.
You have to be even more careful
of who you call your friend.
It tastes really good
when they wiggle, right?
Yeah, it's... so good.
Thank you so much
for taking me in for the night.
I really appreciate it.
Of course.
It's the least we can do
for an ally of Thu Thu Hmong.
He's a friend.
Well, for now.
Howard, I want to talk to you
about something very important.
I'm afraid that this place
isn't safe for you.
Remember how you told me
of your father?
When I met him, he was bright,
curious, eager.
The man you told me about
isn't that person anymore.
He has seen things,
things that changed him.
Wha... What do you mean?
I will shelter you here
for the night,
but in the morning,
you should make every effort
to get home
as quickly as possible.
I don't know how to get back.
Then, you should definitely stay
with... "Spot"
until you find your way home.
Okay.
Good night, Howard Lovecraft.
Sleep well.
Good night.
Whoa.
Hmm-
What?
Howard, are you all right?
Mm, uh-huh.
Did you dream?
I think so.
It just got a little bit
jumbled in my head.
Dreams often do.
Are you ready to begin the day?
Mm-hm.
Then, I wish you luck,
Howard Lovecraft.
And a safe journey.
Hey, Howard,
you left your dinner.
Can I eat it?
Bye, Howard.
Travel safe.
We'll miss you.
Good morning, Spot.
Morning, Master Howard.
Spot, is there a great big castle
somewhere?
Maybe in that direction?
Yes.
Good.
Take me there, please.
Why?
I saw it in my dream.
Seemed pretty important.
Yes.
Let's get a move on.
Hmm-
Master?
Yes, Spot?
Where you come from?
What do you mean?
How your land different?
Oh, that's easy.
I mean, it's not like this
all the time.
We get snow too,
but we only get a little bit
and only in the winter.
A bit?
Um,
well, a bit would be
a lot less snow than this.
This?
I mean, here it just goes on
forever and ever.
But where I'm from,
I'm lucky if we get enough snow
to cancel school.
Or... not that it matters.
Not matter?
Because when I'm at school,
I see all of the other children
being friends with each other.
None of them wanna be
friends with me.
Why?
Because I'm,
you know, different.
Everybody in my family worries,
all the time, about me
or... or my father.
We don't take a lot of time
to play.
Children should play.
Play?
I don't play at all, really.
I like to read.
I like to read a lot.
I love books.
Why?
Books tell amazing stories.
I read them for hours
at a time.
I've even tried writing
a few stories of my own,
believe it or not.
But books and proper stories,
they take you places.
Although most of them
don't actually take you
to another dimension.
Come here?
Yeah.
It was a book my father wrote,
and I left it on my bed
in my room.
Oh, no.
What am I gonna do?
Master, Spot help.
How?
Book take you hear,
book take you home.
How can you guess a thing
like that?
Spot smart.
Book is key.
A book!
I saw a book in my dream
last night.
It was in front of a huge door.
Then?
I was just about to get the book,
and then something grabbed me.
I'm just not sure
what the door was for,
keeping me out
or keeping something in.
I miss my parents.
I wanna go home.
We'll find it.
Hope so, but first things first.
We have to get to the castle.
Agree, Master Howard.
Want more.
We've talked about me a lot.
What about you?
Do you have any family?
What family?
You have to have
a mom and dad.
Some brothers and sisters.
Can't be all alone out here.
R'lyeh not like New England.
Many alone.
Family not for helping.
Family dangerous.
Family scary.
Yeah, sometimes my family
can be pretty scary,
but that doesn't mean
I don't wanna go back
for them.
I've never been away
for this long before.
Master Howard is sad.
Play make happy?
Show Spot play?
Well, in a place like this
with all this snow,
I could see them building
a lot of snow men.
Snow men?
Haven't you ever built
a snow man before?
No.
What do you think?
You like it?
Simulacrum.
What? What's a simulacrum?
A copy of Master Howard.
Oh. I do know that word.
Spot, you really are smart.
You should try making one
of yourself.
Nice snow, Spot... Spot.
More Pk'!!!-
Dodge this.
15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20...
21, 22, 23, 24, 25. Hey!
Uh.
1, 2...
Huh?
Oh. Uh-oh.
- Master Howard!
- Hello.
Master Howard!
Hi, Spot!
Uh, no, no, no, no. No!
Oh.
Whoa.
R'lyeh.
I guessed that, big guy.
This where the king lives?
Not king, but powerful.
Master?
- Go?
- Uh, oh. Yes. Yes.
I-I don't know, Spot.
Are you sure?
Yes.
Welcome.
Huh.
It's not what I imagined.
Imagine?
Yeah. I thought in my head
it would be,
I don't know, cleaner?
It is creepy and really dirty.
There's no one here.
Is someone gonna come out
to greet us,
or are we supposed
to just walk in?
You have no idea, do you?
Nope.
This feels odd, doesn't it?
Hey, Spot, quick question.
I mean, shouldn't there be people
or creatures in this place?
Hm?
Hm-
Mm:
Whoa.
I got a bad feeling about this.
Hi. I'm Howard Lovecraft.
I'm hoping someone can help me.
Spot, they have weapons.
Mm-hm.
No!
This cannot be good.
Howard!
I know you promised
to get me out of the cold
and into someplace warm...
...but, Spot...
Yes?
Being cooked alive
was not in my mind!
Spot! Get us out of here!
You have idea?
Spot?
Spot?
Got you, Master Howard.
Well clone, Spot.
Now you do.
What?
Big breath.
I cannot do that.
- No?
- No.
All I can do is
puff up my cheeks.
Like this.
Hmph.
Big, big breath?
That won't work, Spot.
Spot?
Now would be a good time
to hurry.
Yes.
Whoa!
Spot! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa-oh!
Free.
Arrows?
You Okay?
Not happy.
Can you take them all out?
Yes.
Hmm. Efficient.
Algid Bunk would like
to apologize
for the... misunderstanding.
Misunderstanding?
You tried to cook us!
You almost shot me,
and you hit Spot.
Not now.
Algid will see you now.
Do I have a choice?
Meet Algid, Master Howard.
This way.
Everyone friendly.
I'm gonna pretend
you did not say that.
Uh, before you meet Algicl Bunk,
you must be briefed
in the proper conduct.
Listen up, Spot.
When you meet her,
you will not address her
until she addresses you.
You hear that?
Never approach Algid.
She will summon you closer
...if she desires.
Listen closely.
- I know.
- Oh.
Now, be silent.
We enter Algid's court.
It's amazing.
I present to you Thu Thu Hmong
and-
Howard. Howard Lovecraft.
- And his companion,
Howard Lovecraft.
Have waited a lifetime
for the prophecy
to finally come true.
A strange visitor
from a distant world
arrives out of nowhere?
What fortuitous luck
that brought you
and Thu Thu Hmong together.
Tell me, Howard Lovecraft,
are you the one spoken of
in our lost book?
Lost book?
Will you save our kingdom
from this endless winter?
Hey, you're, uh... you're human,
like me.
You have broken the rules
of the court!
No!
Lower your weapons at once.
Howard is our guest.
I am Algid Bunk.
Hi, Algid Bunk.
It is truly a pleasure
to meet you, Howard.
I understand you've been making
men out of snow.
That's simply astonishing.
They do it all the time
where I'm from.
Your powers are amazing.
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Your Highness.
Thank you for not letting him
kill me, by the way.
You're quite welcome.
We've been expecting you
for quite some time now,
you know?
- Really?
- Of course.
Please, join me in my chambers.
I'll explain everything.
Can I bring Spot with me?
What?
I don't...
I'm not familiar with this word
Spot.
You know, I mean, him.
Thu Thu is Spot is he?
Very well,
Spot may join us.
Come on, Spot.
Here, boy.
Do you see all this, Howard?
Yes, it's very beautiful.
Yes, it is.
And yet it's merely
a painful reflection
of R'lyeh's former glory.
R'lyeh?
My kingdom, yes.
You see, it was not always
this place of ice and desolation.
That's like something Spot said.
He said the snow's been around
for a long time.
A long time.
Yes, that is an understatement.
But I don't understand.
If it was nice before,
what happened?
Long ago, R'lyeh was the most
beautiful kingdom
under the two suns.
Mere words could not capture
its beauty.
It was so good, the poet
Abdul Alhazred said
the citizens forgot
there is bad in the world,
lest we forget.
The people of R'lyeh had created
a cosmic good,
but when the foolish forget
There is darkness
in the world...
...a cosmic evil can arise.
Ignoring the wise words of Abdul,
the darkness grew.
By the time R'lyeh accepted
there was evil,
it was too late.
A water being,
an Ancient One,
rose from the depths.
Cthulhu was spawned.
Cthulhu and his hordes,
hidden in green, slimy vaults,
sunk the city of R'lyeh,
flooding the once-great kingdom.
R'lyeh became
a nightmare corpse city
built by the vast,
loathsome shapes
that seeped down
from the dark stars.
The citizens believed
that if they could
take away the water
that Cthulhu would
lose his power.
In an act of desperation,
the citizens of R'lyeh
froze their kingdom.
Cthulhu was gone.
But our beautiful kingdom
had become our frozen prison.
No one knows
if this story is true,
but we all agree
if there's a way to end
this mind-numbing coldness,
we would do anything.
You see, Howard, it was not only
the land that froze that day,
time itself came to a halt.
Days have passed,
months, even years,
but nothing has changed,
nothing at all.
Until your father arrived.
He journeyed the entire land,
our kingdom included,
writing about his findings.
He rediscovered
the powerful runes
the people of R'lyeh
used so long ago
to freeze our kingdom.
He wrote and drew
these lost secrets
into three books.
One of the books,
we believe the second book,
was stolen from your father
by an Elder thing.
It has been deep underground
with his shoggoth ever since.
What's a shoggoth?
It is a terrible,
indescribable thing.
A shapeless conjuries
of protoplasmic bubbles
with myriads of temporary eyes
forming and unforming,
quite nasty.
Ew.
So these books
that my father wrote,
what were in them?
All manner of things.
These books are powerful,
as they are filled with secrets,
runes,
and symbols of power.
I believe we can bring
our kingdom back
to the way it was before this frozen
nightmare descended on us.
Abdul Alhazred,
many called him King Abdul,
prophesized that a stranger
from a distant land would arrive
to thaw our frozen kingdom.
When you arrived I felt...
I felt hope
for the first time since...
We cannot reclaim it ourselves,
for we are trapped
inside this frozen kingdom,
and it is the only way to stop
this never-ending winter.
Bring me the book, Howard.
Do what no one else can.
Do you think it could be used
to get me home?
I'm sure it can.
After this winter is ended.
I think you've got yourself a deal,
Your Majesty.
To take this book
from the shoggoth,
I'll need to know a lot more
about him.
And I have another request.
Do tell.
What?
I said that I'll get the book
back from the shoggoth.
She said that it was the only way
to restore their kingdom
and end this long winter.
And it made sense,
since they can't leave
until it does.
Too dangerous.
That's why I said I can only do it
on one condition.
What?
That you go with me.
What?
Best of all, she said yes.
No.
Yes, she did.
Good night.
The book!
Ah!
Ah.
Master Howard.
Up, Master Howard.
Must go.
It was just a dreamed...
Howard Lovecraft,
may the wind be at your back.
We will hold you
in our thoughts
until your triumphant return
from the shoggoth.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
All right, Spot.
Come along.
La di da.
La di da.
Oh, Spot, there's no need
to be angry.
Have to go with Master Howard?
Well, yeah.
Of course you do.
Angry.
Not speaking.
Well, now you're just
being childish.
Still not speaking.
This looks like the mountains
we already came from.
No one goes to mountains.
And why is that?
No legend now.
If book anywhere,
it is in mountains.
How much further, Spot?
More.
I'm happy you're speaking
to me again.
I was beginning to think you...
I think I see the cave!
I think we found it.
What is that?
That must be the shoggoth.
Ew.
It's hideous.
What? It is.
All we have to do is sneak in,
grab the book,
and sneak out.
Spot, you're not gonna fit.
Cave too small.
You stay here,
I'll get the book,
and I'll come right back.
We have a deal with the King.
She not King.
Well, who was the last king?
King Abdul.
Very bad.
Abdul the poet?
Abdul many things.
Not poet.
Magic.
Dark.
Well, we have a kingdom to save,
even if the King
isn't home right now.
Careful, Master Howard.
Cave dangerous.
Ew, it smells in here.
What stinks?
Ew.
<i>Oh! boy'</i>
Ew!
Yeah! Woo hoo!
Yeah! Whoo hoo!
Whoo!
Tekeli-li.
La di da.
Tekeli-li.
Tekeli-li.
Tekeli-Ii.
I found it, Spot!
Tekeli-li.
That was easy.
Now let's get out of here
before the shoggoth...
- Tekeli-Ii.
- Ah!
Hey! Augh!
Hmm-
Who dares disturb the sleep
of shoggoth?
Ah!
Tell me, before I crush you.
Ah!
You dare?
Ah!
Tell me who you are.
You want to know who I am?
I am Howard Lovecraft.
Hmm. Lovecraft.
This name is known to me.
How?
You are not the first pale
young mortal of that name
to venture here.
Then my father...
Yes, the other one looked
much the same as you.
And he was every bit as curious.
He sought an audience
with the Deep One.
His hunger for knowledge
had no equal.
Why else would he journey so deep?
What did you tell him?
I gave to him words.
Words of power.
Words that would break down
the walls between worlds.
Words that would burn up his mind
if he dwelled on them.
But Why?
So the fool Lovecraft
could spread my words out
among the stars,
let the walls between worlds
come tumbling down
and let the slumbering
Deep Ones rise.
Since you have found
your way here,
he must have succeeded.
Um, no.
What do you mean, "no"?
We, that's me and Spot,
we just came here
to borrow this book.
Spot?
Hm-
Your Spot, does he have wings?
Yes.
And his face,
covered in tentacles?
Uh, yes.
That is Cthulhu.
You are calling him "Spot"?
He is my friend!
No, he is not your friend.
He is the Sleeper of R'lyeh.
He is the Destroyer of Worlds.
I have opened the door,
but you woke him up
and have brought him through.
Shot!
You promised him
this will work.
Yes.
And you are sure it is this...
Howard?
Our fate rests in the hands
of one child.
The child is not alone.
Thu Thu Hmong,
or should I say "Spot"?
Surely, you jest.
The Great One will awake
from his slumber
and will devour Howard
the first chance he gets.
But for now, the Great One
is helping him.
That is the plan.
Centuries have passed
in this icy prison.
No one has been able to cross
the barrier between worlds,
until he came.
Azathoth will be pleased,
if Howard Lovecraft
is actually the key.
Howard needs to bring back
the balance.
I can feel the balance wants to be
brought back
in all of its glory as well.
Our kingdom will be restored
through the Crawling Chaos,
but the boy...
will not live to see it.
Spot!
Master Howard!
Help me!
Spot!
I gave your father the key
to open the door.
You turned that key...
and released the cosmic evil.
The Elder Ones are free,
led by the Great Old One,
Cthulhu!
Your spot!
Spot
Your role in history is complete.
I want to savor this moment,
Howard Lovecraft.
And I shall savor it
after I gobble you up
and slowly digest you
over a thousand years.
Master Howard!
Put him down. Now!
Thank heavens.
Master Howard!
Shot!
No!
Snot, no!
You ate my friend!
No. He is no friend.
I have not stopped
the Great Old One.
He is too powerful.
When the Sleeper
finally does awake,
then Cthulhu will eat you
himself.
Cthulhu is the Destroyer of Worlds!
You're wrong!
Spot is not a monster.
He's my friend.
Enough of this.
I have delayed long enough.
You are no one,
Howard Lovecraft,
and you have nothing,
nothing in this world
to save you.
Ah!
The Elder Sign!
No!
Spot
Spot! Spot!
Spot, oh, thank heavens
you're all right.
We did it!
I can't believe we did it.
You are all right,
aren't you?
Yes.
All right.
Hmm-
I can feel the warmth already.
Oh. Ah!
Yeah! Whoo!
Question, Master Howard.
What's that, Spot?
I was worried he'd eat you.
Well, it didn't.
Thank you.
You saved me.
Next time, though,
we might not be so lucky.
- "Lucky"?
Yeah. I showed this
horrible monster
that thing in my pocket,
and he froze in fear.
Thing?
This.
- Ah!
- Whoa!
Whoa!
What is it, Spot?
What happened?
Elder Sign.
Here, in R'lyeh,
words have power.
Symbols, more power.
Elder Sign, greatest power.
It's just a necklace.
Where find?
It was given to me.
Powerful gift.
They care for you.
Wow.
Elder Sign
is great power.
Careful.
Book also has power.
Make Algid return you home.
You don't think she would
just let me go?
Maybe.
Promises in R'lyeh are weak.
What?
But you just saved me.
Aren't you...?
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I'm very glad you didn't.
We play in snow.
Make men of snow.
We are friends.
Friends not eat each other.
Yeah. We're
on the same page there.
Unless they get very hungry.
Shot!
You told a joke.
Yes. Good one?
Yeah.
Am I dreaming?
Can it really be?
No more suffering,
my subjects!
We are finally free!
Oh, this is just
the absolute best day.
Let the kingdom
of R'lyeh rejoice.
Know how I fooled a Lovecraft
from my true identity.
Let us restore balance!
Let the Sleeper awake
and destroy Howard Lovecraft!
Spot, what's going on?
Stay close, Master Howard.
I shall take control.
I shall no longer be
the plaything of fate.
With this book and this beast,
I shall unite
all of the realities as one.
Ay hey Cthulhu,
Sarad Shug.
Kaddath a'thui R'lor...
Naga sha'og.
Sihaom yar.
What are they?
I wa gun Cthulhu.
I wa gun Cthulhu.
Oo ah!
Ah hey Cthulhu,
Sarad Shug!
Master Howard, get away.
Get away from me!
Spot, they're words.
- ...Naga sha'og.
- Run.
Master Howard. Go! Home!
It's some sort of spell.
Just fight them.
- Master Howard,
- ALGID: Ay hey Cthulhu...
get away.
- Sarad Shug.
- Get away from me!
Kaddath a Cthulhu...
- R'lor.
- Can't... control... anger.
Naga sha'og.
Run, Master Howard.
See ha oh ya
I cannot control.
- I... am... changing.
- ...Cthulhu.
I wa gun Cthulhu.
0o ah!
Spot?
What the...? Hey!
Spot?
Algid, what did you do to Spot?
We can restore the cosmic good
to R'lyeh.
You allowed me to restore
the balance,
but it's not cosmic good
I'm restoring.
I released the evil long ago,
and they froze everything.
You saw this slumbering destroyer
as a pet.
And this magnificent book
of knowledge
as nothing but a ticket home.
I have vision beyond this realm
that your simple mind could
never hope to grasp.
I am the beast that haunts
your father's dreams.
I am the shadow
that shall bring your doom.
I am the poet that warned them.
I am King.
I am Abdul Alhazred!
When I wake your precious Spot,
when the Sleeper of R'lyeh
awakes,
I will control the power
of Cthulhu.
I, Cthulhu!
Thank you, Howard Lovecraft.
I am not some simple villain
hoping to hold onto
a pathetic scrap of frozen earth.
I don't just want a kingdom,
Howard.
I want every kingdom.
Across the black sea of infinity,
there are monsters.
Witness!
The Ancient One is awake!
The Great and Powerful Cthulhu
is here!
Let your mind go mad!
It makes no difference.
I shall rule all of R'lyeh
or see it shattered before me!
This is our kingdom too!
Oh!
Ah! Insolence!
I will make you suffer!
Hold on, Spot.
Here, Howard.
A Lovecraft knows
what to do with this.
There's gotta be something
in here.
Ah! Get the book!
F'thagn Cthulhu.
Azhign.
Kisn ubshug.
Obutushay.
Zeoro!
Attack!
Surround them!
We got him!
I slapped the bad guy!
Yeah, a whole buncha times.
None of these words
make sense.
Get the book!
Ia thugna.
Shug pen gift.
P'on gwen.
Ah!
Nope.
Ah! Get the book!
Ya ool bathoo. Ba'al mag.
Gan ai shug. Ooa!
That's my room!
That's my home!
Run,
Master Howard, go!
No.
I'm not leaving any of you.
Davik!
Stay away from him!
Tell me, Howard,
are you afraid of the dark?
Because my darkness
has no fear of you.
In fact, I think it wants you
to join it.
No!
Just close your eyes
and slip into its abyss.
Howard, go to your home
before it's too late!
Oowai galago um.
Ya Nog Shug. Ooa!
The Elder Sign! Put it away.
Give me that.
No... Whoa!
Get back to the shadows!
Get back!
No! Spot!
You cannot defeat me with that.
That is not dead
which can eternal lie.
And with strange aeons,
even death may die.
Give me that.
Your father tried
to recreate Al Azif,
but the Necronomicon he created
isn't even close.
His feeble attempt at writing
a version made him mad.
This is not my final form.
I shall return,
and you'll never see me coming!
This is not a victory for you,
Howard,
this is only a delay
of the inevitable!
Spot, are... are you okay?
Please tell me you're not hurt.
I... am...
Spot
The people of R'lyeh will know
of Algid's deception,
and she will no longer have
any power over them.
I don't want to leave you guys.
We've won!
Time to go.
You... you squid kids.
I love you guys
You have a great family.
Always stick together.
Take care of each other.
Howard, when you learn more
about the writings in the book,
you can come back.
For now, you have to go.
Bye, Howard!
I ate your dinner.
I'll miss you, Howard.
Thank you, Thu Thu Hmong.
Not Spot?
Thu Thu Hmong, Spot,
I will never forget you.
I will never forget you,
Master Howard.
I will try to come back.
I will miss you all.
Mother!
Are you sure about this,
Howard?
I want to give him
this gift.
Well, while I am a doctor,
I also am fascinated
with the relationship
between medicine
and the occult.
Your father claims
he went to a strange land.
And we know he came back...
different.
He's told me his stories.
They are maddening.
So imaginative, yet so clear.
The most merciful thing
in the world
is the inability
of the human mind
to correlate all its contents.
Hello, Father.
Howard?
I have something for you.
You did it!
You did it, my boy!
You closed the portal to R'lyeh!
I hope you can rest now, Father.
My evil deed is undone.
Thank you, my boy.
Thank you.
Now I can get better.
I love you, Father.
Your father's mind...
had seen too much, you see.
His journey to the kingdom
of madness
took him to the edge
of these endless waters.
Be careful, Howard.
You have helped your father,
you have helped him
a great deal.
And he will now be able
to get better,
but...
I fear... your journey
has just begun.
Good night, my sweet.
Good night, Mother.
Sweet dreams, Howard.
They will be, Mother.
They will be.
I will learn your secrets,
no matter how long it takes me.
I will see my friends
and I will go back to R'lyeh,
for there the dark elements
of strength...
...solitude,
grotesqueness and ignorance
combine to form the perfection
of the hideous.
