Pull it.
Get that end.
Oh, man.
Lady, you're covering up my causes.
Can I put it in your window?
Let me see what it is.
I'm for free enterprise.
Put it up.
Thanks.
Murphy's Pharmacy.
I'll have the banana split.
- No, I won't. I'll have a Coke.
- Coke.
Lemon Coke.
Is that real lemon?
It is.
I grow 'em in my backyard.
Mrs. Ratcliff says
her cough isn't any better.
Well, tell her to call the doctor.
She wants more cough medicine.
Well, don't send it to her.
She's drinking it for the alcohol.
You lived here long?
- All my life.
- You like it?
Well, I must have,
or I wouldn't have stayed.
What kind of town is this?
Oh, it's small, friendly, nosy.
You can carry a gun,
but you can't get an abortion.
I don't want to do either.
Morning, Murph.
How's it goin'?
Morning, Leroy.
Just fine.
Where do you come from?
This time Modesto, California.
Then you know the rules.
The rules? You mean, like,
keep your front room picked up?
Don't sit around in your bathrobe
after 10:00 in the morning?
- Don't mess with a married man?
- That's part of it.
The rest of it is we got
a Rhodes scholar, we got a homosexual.
We've got marijuana growing
in with the tomatoes.
We've even got a man
who wears his wife's nightgown.
We're in the mainstream.
Actually, not yet.
Just today I got called
honey," “mmissy'"...
and I think there was
a little lady" in there somewhere.
Well, they're not too familiar
with the E.R.A.
If it's consciousness-raising you're
looking for, you'll have to head east.
How much do I owe you?
It'II be 35 cents.
And you don't have to tip me.
I own the place.
I wasn't going to.
See ya round.
Well, yes, ma'am.
Well, how'd it go?
They don't have a computer
in that school.
Did you talk to anybody?
One kid. He's an Indian.
Good.
They give you a lot of homework?
I did it on the bus.
That's great.
So you go on in and have some milk and
cookies, then come out here and help me.
Christ! I didn't get any milk.
So have yourself
some water and cookies.
Bring me a cookie.
- Come on. Hurry up!
- Mom, can I get some ice cream?
That's enough.
- Make that two.
- I already got you one.
- Thanks.
- Next. What would you like?
Have a seat, ma'am.
Go ahead.
Let's go, Bo.
Good fiddlin', Murph.
Real sweet, Murph.
- This your boy?
- Yeah. This is my boy, Jake.
Murphy Jones.
Pleased to meet you, son.
You moonlighting?
Oh, no. We just let off a little steam
on the weekends.
Me and the high school principal
and the basketball coach...
whenever he can get over
from Winslow.
- You going to Pierson Junior High?
- Yes, sir.
Well, I went there. Of course,
it was back in the Dark Ages.
You don't look
like you go back that far.
Oh, lady, I'm a granddaddy.
I got a four-year-old grandson
named after me.
- Hello there, Murphy.
- Margaret, how are ya?
Coming over to play bridge
on Wednesday?
No. I'm sorry, I can't.
Edith Hollis is making me spaghetti.
Besides, you and Warner fight
too damn much over the bidding.
Well, all right for you.
Look like you don't watch
much late-night television.
No, I'm pretty well booked up.
See, I'm a widower.
That's the same as catnip to a cat...
in a town where the ladies
outnumber you ten to one.
Well, it looks like everybody's
been to the restroom.
I better get back.
Good night, son.
One, two, three, four.
Come on, Mom.
Gin.
Oh, honey.
God, it's 1:00.
I kept you up again. I'm sorry. You can
go to bed even though I'm winning.
You don't even
have to brush your teeth.
Oh, yes, you do.
If you get a cavity I'll kill myself.
- Have you ever had a business license?
- No.
Well, it'll take me a few minutes
to type up the papers.
Just sit down over there,
and no smoking.
We've been waitin' for ya, Murphy.
We've got a warrant out for ya.
Don't heat up, Jesse.
I got the money right here.
That's 22 tickets at 10 dollars
apiece. That's $220.
Twenty-two tickets
in twenty-two days?
- It doesn't make sense!
- It does to me.
Murphy, why don't you move the car?
- Move the damn parking meter.
- I've talked to the town council.
They won't do it.
They want the parking meter there.
Then we're going to be seeing
a lot of each other.
Mrs. Moriarty.
I'll take you down here, Mr. James.
Why are you doin' this, Murphy?
Are you having a nervous breakdown?
If it were my dog,
I'd tie it up out front...
go out and give it some water,
a pat on the head... same thing.
It's a car, Murphy!
It's an inheritance, a family heirloom,
and I'm gonna keep my eye on it.
They've stolen my hubcaps,
they've taken my tires...
they've unscrewed my Venus.
I'm not gonna stand still for that.
Put in a supply of quarters, Murphy.
You're beaten.
I've got a proposal.
You take out the meter, and I'll
put in a tree... a big, full-grown one.
It'll provide shade,
it'll cut down on acid rain.
Give the dogs something
to lift a leg against.
Tell that to your city council.
- Mrs. Moriarty.
- Mr. Jones.
- So, what are you? The town oddball?
- When I'm pushed, I shove.
Don't you know
you can't fight city hall?
You can wrestle 'em.
You're not a good risk.
There's no husband to cosign.
There's no collateral. You're renting,
you're paying on your truck.
- I don't see any assets.
- I'm the asset.
I've been working ranches all my life.
I didn't know what hair curlers were...
till I was 16 years old.
You're a woman.
You mean to tell me if there were
a fly on these pants I'd get the loan?
You'd have a better chance.
I'd go out on the streets
but you've only got one.
I think that's gonna
work for me, Murph.
- Thank you very much.
- Got everything you need?
Bessie, don't forget the labels.
You're getting absentminded lately.
You were wearing
two different colored socks yesterday.
- Good morning.
- Is it?
Well, no new country was invaded today,
and the sun's out. I'll settle for that.
Are you always this cheerful
so early in the morning?
If I eat my prunes
and the market edges up.
Well, some of us aren't in the market.
Some of us are just in the soup.
Is something wrong?
Could I have two extra-strength Tylenol
and a glass of water, please?
Sure.
How do you open this stupid thing?
Oh, I'll get it.
- There's a lot of flu goin' around.
- Well, I hope I catch it.
- And die.
- What's wrong?
I need a loan and I can't get one.
Hey, you're a big man in this town,
aren't you?
Well, I have to pay
my parking tickets.
- How'd you like to loan me some money?
- No.
Oh, that was real friendly.
We're not friends.
I don't know you.
I don't know your character.
It's just like anybody else's:
it's good sometimes, it's bad sometimes.
But I'm up every morning at dawn.
I don't quit till it's dark.
I've worked goddamn hard
for all these calluses.
I'm carrying these people on my books.
Helen Taylor was taken off Medicare
because they weren't quite sure...
whether she needed a wheelchair
for a broken back.
Now, Andy Stern...
he was fired two days
before his pension started...
after 30 years with the company.
The tire company moved out
and welched on their health contracts.
Stu Hanson still needs digitalis.
You're way down the line.
I have an uncle in Dallas who would
call you a bleeding-heart liberal.
Lady, I don't give a diddly-shit
what they call me.
And I don't know
if the organ is bleeding or not...
but according to my E.K.G.
I've got one.
Well...
I guess...
that's that.
Sorry that I can't make you the loan.
Now, I am on
the volunteer fire department.
If your barn burns
you'll see me.
Well, it just might...
for the insurance.
Jake, will you watch what you're doing?
You're missing that entire side.
Ma, how many more of these
do we have to do?
All of them.
Well, come on. You gotta wipe
the dirt off. You can't just squirt it.
Jake, we got a problem.
We're counting every penny here,
so you gotta help me out.
You can't just leave the lights on
all over the house...
and you can't spend any more money
on magazines, 'cause we're broke.
We're busted. All right?
We gotta make do.
We gotta use it up and wear it out...
all of it.
'Cause we're on our own.
We're on our own, pal.
You and me, pal.
We got two pretty good heads here.
We'll just put 'em together, huh?
We'll be all right, right?
- Right?
- Right.
- Here ya go.
- Thanks, Rose.
Excuse me.
Do you need a box boy?
No, honey.
We already got one.
Excuse me, sir.
You got a paper route I could have?
- Have you got a bicycle?
- No, sir.
Well, you can't deliver papers
without a bicycle, sonny.
Thank you.
Excuse me, Mr. Jones.
Do you need your car washed
for a dollar?
No one lays a hand on that car
but me.
Hold it a minute, son.
Bessie, would you
hold down the fort?
You don't see any grease in there.
This car looks the same as it did
in the showroom in South Bend in 1927.
Looks real clean.
A doctor could operate in there.
Come here.
Look at that upholstery, huh?
That's the original upholstery.
Right over there...
that's an eight-day clock.
You see this?
This is etched glass... etched.
And here is a vase for a rose.
- What kind of mileage do you get?
- You wanna find out? Hop in.
- You mean it?
- Sure. We can go for a ride. Get in.
- Does it go any faster?
- No.
- What if you want to pass a truck?
- It passes me. I'm in no hurry.
Gimme a ride to crossroads.
Be happy to, Mr. Abbott.
I'm settled. Let's go.
Mr. Abbott, like you to meet
Jake Moriarty.
Mr. Abbott's our oldest citizen.
- Hi, there.
- Hi.
Yep. Gonna be 89 in September.
How are things goin' with you,
Mr. Abbott?
Gonna be some changes.
I'm gettin' married.
Well, who's the lady?
Kate Cooper.
She's from Poindexter.
I'm afraid
I haven't had the pleasure.
Well, she's old, like I am.
Nobody wants her.
But I do.
Well, you be sure and give her
my best wishes.
We'll get along.
We hug, kiss.
Still have those feelings.
Still know how.
Don't think you youngsters
got a monopoly on it.
I'm sure heartened to hear it,
Mr. Abbott.
You're goin' too fast!
I don't want an accident before the day.
- We're doin' 30 miles an hour.
- Well, it's too goddamn fast.
Now stop this thing.
Let me out of here.
I'll walk the rest of the way.
Don't like the way you drive, Murphy.
Now, it's good not to taper off.
You show up every afternoon at 5:00,
and you can wash glasses for $3 an hour.
Three-fifty.
I see you take after your mother.
Whoa, baby.
Hey, Wayman! Come over here
and check this thing out for me.
All right.
Freeman, you putting him up today?
You bet your sweet...
Yes, ma'am, I am.
- You gonna buy yourself something?
- No, I'm just window shopping.
Get a seat up on the truck
or you won't see much.
- Here.
- Oh. Thanks.
Thank you.
Are you comin' to the Elks dance
on Saturday night?
- I'm not an Elk.
- You don't have to be.
Everybody's welcome.
About Saturday I'm usually
soaking my feet. I'm not on 'em.
- Then I'll see you around.
- See you around.
Albert's a good dancer.
I've known a lot of them.
- Men been giving you a little trouble?
- Nothing but.
Is that war still going on?
I've been out of it for some time.
Jake tells me he's gonna be
washing dishes for you.
Well, that's more
than I can get him to do for me.
Thanks.
Well, good morning to y'all.
And I hope it is a good morning
and I can turn a dime's worth of profit.
Now, boys, I brought over
some bargains and some surprises today.
It's up to you all
to figure out which is which.
All right, now.
Let's do some business.
This first string of horses come
from Mrs. Dinwiddie's place.
We'll start with this little bay
right here.
All right, we'll start
with a hundred dollars. I got a hundred.
- One and a half.
- And I got a half.
I kinda like the look of that one.
Well, don't fall in love.
- Bowed tendons.
- That's not good, huh?
That's not good.
Three and a half once...
Are you sure?
Sold for $350.
Bring out the little sorrel, boys.
March him around real pretty.
- He's as pretty as a speckled pup.
- Popped knees.
Take a look at him, boys.
Well put-together animal.
Let's have that black in here.
He's got pretty white feet on him.
- He's as gentle as a puppy.
- Fistulous withers.
Don't disappoint me, now, boys.
Start him out big.
All right.
Bring in that bay, boys.
Got a good-lookin' animal for ya,
fellas.
This is Mrs. Dinwiddie's
favorite horse.
Good saddle horse.
Put together real well.
I want you to check that conformation
on this animal here.
Probably one of the best things
we'll show you all day.
All right.
Bring him on around here, boys.
Take a good look at him.
All right. Let me hear from you.
Okay. Now you can wade in.
- One hundred dollars.
- I got a hundred dollar bid.
Who'll give me two?
I need $200.
Two!
I got a $200 bid.
Who'll give me three?
- Four!
- I got $400 bid.
- Five!
- I got a $500 bid. Gimme six.
- Six hundred.
- I got a $600 bid.
- Give me $700.
- Seven-fifty.
$750 over here.
Do I hear eight one time?
- Nine hundred!
- Have a $900 bid.
Need a thou. One time.
Give me a thou.
- $1,000.
- Got a thousand dollar bid.
Gentlemen, I got
a thousand dollar bid.
$1,000.
Do I hear any more?
Do I hear any advance?
Sold to that gentleman sitting
on the flatbed truck.
And I'll tell you, boys, he stole it
while you were scratchin' your head...
or whatever else you got that itches.
You're too tapped out to make me a loan,
but you've got $1,000 for a horse.
-Not that you owe me anything.
-The widow's my cousin. Blood's thicker.
Well, you got a good horse.
Where you gonna keep him?
With you.
Good boy.
Don't you ever work?
Bessie does. I'm getting other interests
at this time of life.
Yeah? Like what?
I'm taking French lessons
by correspondence course.
It's the language of diplomacy.
I'm writing a chili cookbook, reading
General Stonewall Jackson's letters.
That ought to keep you young.
It takes something more than that.
Like what?
Something that puts the heart
back into you.
Like loving somebody.
That's right.
Hey! What the hell are you doing?
Get out of here, you idiot!
Jesus, lady.
Are you all right?
I am if you're insured.
I ain't.
You having a little cry?
What for?
It cost three dollars
for an aspirin tablet in here.
Three dollars!
They're charging me 150 bucks a night.
And my head hurts. Take your choice.
Here. Blow your nose.
It cost a dollar for that.
Well, you can pay for it.
Things are picking up out at your place.
Oh, yeah? How come?
I put the word out. There's a mare
chompin' hay in your barn right now.
Albert Sawlsville's.
Jim Forrest came by. He left a bay.
And Coverly... Freeman...
he left a runty little piebald
with you.
Looks like the main line's busted.
It'll be over in a minute.
I'll wait.
I guess I'm just feeling
a little sorry for myself.
I'll listen if you wanna talk.
I've been sitting here thinking
I'm raising this kid all by myself.
Probably making all these mistakes,
and he's gonna be ruined.
I have a concussion.
I'm 33 years old,
and I'm living like a nun.
Let's take a little walk down the hall
and calm you down.
I don't want to.
- Well, let's do it anyway.
- I don't want to.
Come on.
Just throw your feet out here.
Once around.
Are these your slippers?
- Yes.
- All right. There. Okay.
There.
Now, put your feet down.
We won't set any records or anything.
We'll just go nice and easy.
Let's review your troubles.
You're raising a kid.
You're doing a good job.
He washes his hands after he goes
to the bathroom. I noticed.
And your concussion is mild.
I asked the doctor.
You're 33?
That's seasoned, not sagging.
You're living like a nun.
Next time you're asked,
say yes. "
- What do you do?
- You're asking me about my sex life?
Yes. I am.
Once in a while I go up to Phoenix.
There's a lady there gives me dinner...
and breakfast.
- I wondered.
- Oh, did you, now?
Any of them yours?
I told you, I go out of town.
Now, you feeling better?
- Yes.
- I think you're gonna make it.
Your color's good, your prospects are
good, and Christmas is coming.
- You got only one problem.
- What?
That hospital nightshirt
you're wearing...
it's open all the way down the back.
I came in to get my allergy shots
for my asthma, so...
Thanks a lot for telling me. Why don't
you just parade me on Main Street?
Well.
You sure are a sight for sore eyes.
I thought I had enough problems.
Well, I'm not here to add to 'em.
I just wanted to see you again.
Two years is a hell of a long time.
Bobby Jack, I only got ten dollars.
I don't have a checking account.
- You think I'm putting the bite on you?
- Yes. I do.
Well, I just wanted
to look into your blue eyes again.
They're brown.
I missed you.
God, I hope you're
on your way someplace else.
I got bad news.
My old daddy died.
Oh, God.
I'm so sorry.
Yeah. He just ate his supper,
climbed into bed and just went.
Oh, Bobby Jack. I'm so sorry.
He was such a dear old man.
Now you and Jake are
my only living relatives.
The divorce was final.
Dad!
Jake?
Look at you! Come here!
Oh, boy! Oh, God Almighty!
- Hey, did you miss me?
- Yeah!
I missed you a lot.
Did you miss me?
- Yeah, I missed you.
- Oh, Dad!
Oh, did I miss you.
- You're back.
- Yeah, I'm back.
And that's when the recession hit.
So they lost a lot of members
out at the country club...
and they didn't need
a golf pro anymore.
I was in Flagstaff for a while
selling ads for the Yellow Pages.
Went to bartender's school.
I even got a job up in Portland...
but everybody's drinking
white wine these days.
- So you're broke, huh?
- Jake, you're a string bean.
- You shot up.
- He needs new pants every other month.
- You got a mustache.
- Yeah. It's a tickler. You like it?
Yeah.
You got a motorcycle too.
And that bike leaves 'em all
at the stop light.
That thing is more fun
than a roller coaster.
I didn't get you anything
because... no...
because I wanted
to get to know you again.
Pick out something
that was just right.
- I don't need anything.
- Well, dream something up.
Let the genie out of the bottle.
You gotta pull the cork.
- Dreams...
- Honey, it's bedtime.
- You gonna stay?
- I'd like to.
I'm all moteled" out.
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night.
Jake...
There are other people
in the room here.
Oh. Sorry. Good night.
Good night, dear.
- Sweet dreams.
- Thank you.
My daddy wanted you to have this.
It was mentioned in the will.
I think you should keep it.
He loved you.
I love you.
Well...
it started out that way.
Remember the back seat
to the old '59 Chevy?
You mean the one
that got repossessed?
Yeah.
While we had it,
we used it.
I was 16. I'm 33.
I'm older too.
And I'm trying to get smarter.
You having any luck?
- Emma, I'm a different person.
- Are you?
- I'm a born-again Christian.
- No.
- Yes.
- My gosh.
I hope they don't pass you
the collection plate.
- That's not a kind remark, Emma.
- No.
You know the Internal Revenue Service?
They were looking for you.
You kind of forgot
to file your income tax.
I'm on their good books again.
I took a lot of bounce
out of your goddamn checks.
This leopard is trying
to change his spots.
I don't believe you.
The boy's real glad to see me.
Well, that's blackmail.
If you can tell me
that the fire's out...
that there's not
one spark left between us...
then I'll tip my hat,
get back on the motorcycle.
I divorced you.
Yeah. And I saw you crying
on the courthouse steps.
Big deal.
- I could sleep in with Jake.
- I haven't said you could stay.
- You haven't said L can't.
- Goddamn it, Bobby Jack.
Why were you never as good on your feet
as you were in bed?
Well, I'm gonna be.
You'll see.
There's one bathroom in this house.
I use it first.
- Howdy.
- Good morning.
- What a day, huh?
- Yeah. It's supposed to hit 80.
Well, I'm a lizard.
I love the heat.
- You the hired hand, dad?
- No, son, I'm not.
I just stable my horse here.
I'm the husband.
Congratulations.
Been away serving your country
or something?
We got divorced.
Sort of makes you an ex-husband,
doesn't it?
Well, when your foot's in the door
it's pretty hard to close it.
I'm supposed to clean the stable.
That ought to get you started.
What do I do?
I'm a city boy.
I think if I were you...
I'd roll up my pants
and walk tiptoe.
Next?
Hoof pick. Curry comb.
Body brush. Dandy brush.
Mane and tail comb.
Grooming cloth.
They should all look
like they're going to Sunday school.
Next.
Feed 'em. Give a little corn, oats
with a Little molasses mixed in.
Oh, sorry.
- Next?
- Teeth.
- Teeth?
- Teeth.
You get a flashlight,
you open the horse's mouth.
You push the tongue aside, and you look
at the molars and incisors on the side.
Then push the tongue to the other side
and look at the molars on that side.
I warn you:
Some horses resist this procedure.
Caught ya lookin'.
You mean to stand there
and tell me...
you won't eat it
unless I cut it up for ya?
Well, all righty, here.
Come on.
Come on. Oh, not my fingers.
Yo, Murph. You know
anything about plumbing?
It's necessary.
Could you fix
a stopped-up toilet?
I guess I probably could.
It wouldn't be my first priority.
There's three of us living
in this house and one bathroom.
The plumber can't get here
till Wednesday.
- Might be the ball cock.
- Most problems start there.
I took it apart, but I can't
get it back together again.
Well, I've been doing this since
the days you had to pull the chain.
Boardwalk!
- He tried.
- Yeah, well, these things are tricky.
He's out of a job.
That's why he's here.
Times are tough.
I remember during the depression...
the real one...
20, 30 men a day
come to our back door...
and my mama would take them in
and feed 'em all.
That's all I'm doing.
I'm gonna need some pliers.
Right.
Thank you.
Well, it's workin'.
Somebody threw a cigar butt
down there.
Are you smokin'?
Murphy, stay to dinner?
We got corned beef hash.
To tell you the truth,
I don't have too much of an appetite.
- You want milk or beer?
- Beer would be fine.
- Thousand Island or Italian?
- I'll take Italian.
- French fries?
- Yeah, if you got them.
- You take ketchup?
- On everything.
If anybody's listenin',
I'll take Thousand Island on my salad.
I don't want French fries or ketchup,
and a beer would be fine with me too.
I know what you like.
- Can I have a beer?
- In about five years you can.
We've met, but
we haven't been introduced.
- I'm Bobby Jack Moriarty.
- Murphy Jones.
You seem to be a pretty handy fellow
to have around, Murphy.
Well, I tinker a bit.
The question is, what with?
Most anything.
I could sew
Mrs. Moriarty here a dress.
I could cut it out, hem it and finish
the buttonholes and put in a zipper.
- Is that right?
- That's right.
Give me a Butterick pattern,
and you got it.
You one of those funny fellows?
The only son
of a widowed mother.
Wanna have supper with us? We're
just having frankfurters and sauerkraut.
I could put away three or four.
They're on.
- Stew?
- That beef or lamb?
- Beef.
- That's my preference.
Chili!
- I'd like to know something.
- Don't step on the wet floor.
How come that old geezer finishes up
his horseback ride every night...
just as we're sittin' down to supper and
ends up with his feet under our table?
I think he times it that way.
Cut.
What's the game?
Five card draw.
High only. Nothing wild.
Ante up.
Two, two.
Three, three, three, three.
Four, four, four, four.
Five, five, five, five.
Okay, I'm in.
- Check.
- Check.
It'll cost you two
big Blue Diamond matchsticks.
- I'll see ya.
- Call.
- I'm in.
- How many?
- I need a little help. Three.
- Three. How unfortunate.
- One, and look out.
- One.
- I'll take four.
- Four?
- Four.
- Four.
Oh, I'll play these.
- What do you say?
- I'll check.
I'll check.
I'll bet three...
- Whose bet?
- Yours.
Well, let's test for gas.
I bet 20.
- We have a ten match limit.
- All right!
Then I bet ten. There you go.
I'm looking at
a lonely pair of twos.
I have this strong conviction
we'll get clobber by an ace high flush.
- Throw them in.
- You got rid of me.
She's bluffin'. She's bluffing.
I call ya.
Well, this house is about
as full as you can get.
Two gents, three ladies.
Read 'em and weep.
I just picked this hand up.
I almost had a heart attack.
All night long I don't see anything,
then, whamo, right in one hand.
- Who wants root beer floats?
- Me.
-I'll have one.
-Keep an eye on this. I don't trust 'em.
Thanks for bringing the ice cream.
I've been mooching
a lot of meals off you lately.
We've kind of taken you
out of circulation.
- Would you open these?
- Yeah.
What do the ladies in town say?
They're hangin' over the back fences.
I guess they have to have
something to gossip about.
Yeah, they do like
something to chew on.
Of course, they know
my husband's back.
They think three is
a real interesting number.
We got six, ten, jack.
Four, ten, eight.
Queen, seven, oh, three diamonds.
Look out for this guy.
And nine of spades.
Who knows? Ace high bets. Five.
- Call.
- I'm out.
I'll call.
Five of clubs. Nothin' there.
And four of clubs.
Busted flush.
So, whoa, what do you know?
A pair of bullets.
Looks like I'm the big...
Let's you and me walk out
on the front porch for a minute, huh?
- Don't you want to finish the game?
- We'll get to it.
Mister, I didn't care to speak in front
of your boy, but you're cheating.
You're dealing off the bottom of the
deck. We're only playing for matches.
I'm usually playing for eatin' money.
Guess I picked up a bad habit.
Lose it while you're here.
What are you going to tell them
about comin' out here?
Tell them we had
a pissin' contest and you won.
The one with the leather strap.
- Okay. This one?
- Yeah.
- All right.
- Okay, now.
Doesn't sit quite right, does it?
Makes your ears jut out.
I don't know what's wrong
with a plain old baseball cap.
I'm just trying to sharpen him up,
make him fit in.
This is western country.
It calls for a cowboy hat.
Let me see the one
with the snakeskin hatband.
- This one?
- Yeah.
Now this one's
got some snap to it.
- How much?
- 49.50.
Let's take a look
in the mirror here.
I want one
just like the one I got on.
Aren't you getting
tired of that shirt?
Don't try to switch me off it. I want
the same stripe and the same color.
This is my shirt.
- You're out of style.
- L wouldn't be surprised.
- Good evening.
- Hello.
I don't know. It just seems
to sort of sit there, doesn't it?
Maybe it needs a different crease
or something. Here.
It doesn't matter how you bend it.
It's how you wear it.
You wear it back
on your head like that...
that means you like people, your
digestion works, and you got all day.
You wear it tipped
over on the side like that...
means you're a rooster and you're
looking for a young lady or a fight...
whichever comes first.
But if you wear it square on your head,
low down on your forehead...
that means get off the sidewalk
and clear a path...
'cause you're cocked
and ready to fire.
We're going to the movies.
I haven't been to a movie since
the duke died. Maybe I'll look in.
What?
Where's this coming from?
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Thanks, honey.
- You're welcome.
Now, there's enough for everybody.
You have room?
I worked in a slaughterhouse
one summer.
Don't have to pay good money
to see it again.
There sure was a lot of blood.
They use ketchup.
They fake everything out there.
Want a Lifesaver?
I saw what my dad did
while we were playing cards.
Maybe it's
a good thing you did.
He did it twice.
Take after him or not,
it's up to you.
We're sure gettin'
a good-lookin' sky tonight.
See that?
That's the North Star.
In the old days, before
they had compasses or sextants...
they crossed the whole ocean
just by following that.
Isn't that remarkable?
Sick to my stomach.
Three dollars
for human hamburger.
Have a mint.
Thanks.
What's going on over there?
- Thursday night bingo.
- Bingo? You're kidding. That's great.
You think you could get us in?
Love to do something for fun.
I've paid my dues.
I guess I can. Come on.
I like bingo. I've never won
anything at it, but I like bingo.
O-72.
Seven, two.
B-11.
A one, one.
- H-43.
- What?
We're playing hingo"?
N-43.
Four, three.
- I got it! Bingo!
- Check that, Henry.
Missed it by one.
Where was the six?
There's plenty of time.
I'm not even close.
N-4-2, G-4-7 and O-6-9.
- It's all correct. He's a winner.
- Are there any other winners?
If not, I declare
this game completed.
Jonas, you won $68.
You can buy your wife
some black stockings.
It's goin' in the bank.
Ladies and gentlemen,
there will be a five-minute break.
The bar's open.
Be right back.
- Hi!
- Hi.
Boy, it sure is hot in there.
I guess it's just
my time of life.
No, it's hot.
You know, I think Murphy's
gaining weight. You must be a good cook.
Well, I wouldn't
win any contests.
Well, probably just comes up
to your place for the company.
He sure seems cheered up.
I've never seen him down.
Honey, that man was a wreck.
He was drunk the first year.
Never spoke to a soul the second.
Crazy about his wife.
Was she sick for very long?
Not a day in her life.
She just turned around to say
something to him, and she dropped dead.
O-72.
Seven, two.
- Seven, two.
- I have it.
I-19.
- You don't have it.
- A one, a nine.
Oh, I have it.
N-40.
- I don't even have that.
- That's the worst card I ever saw.
Oh, wait, I have that.
O-75.
Seven, five.
- Worst card I ever saw.
- Oh, I have this one.
- Look at that.
- N-37.
- You don't have that either.
- Three, a seven.
Bingo! Bingo! I got bingo!
Henry, check the little lady.
I got... What do I get?
Wait a minute, honey.
We got to be sure you're the right one.
- Okay.
- She's got N-3-6.
- N-3-7. The free spot.
- The free spot.
N-40 and N-3-5.
She's got 'em all, Henry.
I've got 'em all!
Are there any other winners?
If not, I declare
this game completed.
- How much did I win?
- The biggest pot of the night.
- Yeah?
- Two hundred dollars.
Oh, my God!
Two hundred dollars!
I won two hundred dollars!
Oh, my God!
Two hundred dollars!
I'm gonna have to
bring you here more often.
Well, I liked it.
Where did you guys go?
You missed the best part.
That guy got it right
in the forehead with a hatchet.
It split his skull like a melon.
It was so great.
I won! I won $200
at bingo just like that.
- I won!
- You kiddin'?
Makes up for the money that somehow
got itself lost out of my purse.
That's great.
I'm running a little short.
Could you loan me 20?
Good boy, Primrose.
- What's all this?
- For you.
I'm going to drink
14 cases of beer?
Throwin' a barbecue.
I invited everybody.
- Who's everybody?
- Whole damn town.
- What'd you do that for?
- Celebrate our wedding anniversary.
- I don't celebrate that day anymore.
- Yeah, well, I do, May 21.
We were married on the 15th.
- You just wanted a party.
- Life's short!
Come on, Jake!
You got it!
Push, boy! Come on!
Come on, son!
Okay, keep goin'!
You got it made!
Keep goin', boy!
All right!
All right! That's my boy!
That's my boy!
That's Jake Moriarty,
ladies and gentlemen.
You need a refill, Sheriff?
Okay. There you go.
How about you?
There you go.
There you go.
You fellows need some more beer
at this table? You okay?
Now, it's Suzie or Beth?
I can't tell you two apart.
Some of the boys want
something a little stronger.
Am I supposed to wipe off
what you don't wash off?
Give it back.
How old are you?
- Who wants to know?
- I do.
Well, I know who
Herbert Hoover was.
- Yeah, but how old are you really?
- Old enough to know better.
- Come on. Tell me. How old?
- On bad days, as old as Methuselah.
You're as bad as a woman.
You're not going to tell me, are you?
It doesn't look like it.
You missed another one.
Looks like we're gonna run out.
What kind of husband
were you, Murphy?
Well, I don't know that
I was so easy to live with.
I don't demonstrate
everything I feel.
I am stubborn, and I was
a little tight about money.
They say if you have one good marriage,
you can have another.
They're rare.
I know.
I was a little surprised
to find a woman in love with me.
- Why? Don't you like yourself?
- Yes, I do.
I just didn't expect it
to be contagious.
You're a big help in the kitchen.
- Finish those dishes, dad?
- Still at it, son.
You two got a lot to talk about,
don't you, dad?
We exchange a few words, son.
You know what I think, dad?
Could we sever
this family relationship?
I'm not your dad,
and I wouldn't be too happy if I were.
I think you're bangin' Emma.
Banging. " Kind of an ugly expression
for that particular pleasure.
How about fuckin”??
I don't like that one
a whole lot better.
Yeah, but that's
what's going on, isn't it?
If I'd had that privilege, I wouldn't be
taking it up with you over a trash can.
Well, I'm takin' it up with you.
You are a miserable
little son of a bitch. You know that?
I don't know why she took you in the
house. I'd bed you down with the dogs.
And I'll tell you
something else, mister.
You may be younger, but you're about to
get your ass kicked to the state line.
And I'm wearin' the boots
that can do it.
You're a feisty old bugger,
aren't ya?
I thought we just settled that.
I love you more
Than the morning loves the flowers
Than the ocean loves the shore
Than a day loves the hours
I will love you longer
Than the desert sky is lonely
Oh, you can believe me
I love you only
Sometimes it felt
like I had two kids.
I love you only
I'm cuttin' in.
- I see you have legs.
- I see you changed your shirt.
- Nice legs.
- Nice shirt.
You ought to be
out of wind by now.
One, two... one, two, three.
I came to dance.
Don't hog her.
It's come around to me again.
I miss you when you're gone.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!
I got this idea. How about
if the two of you dance together?
Care to?
I'll lead. Watch your toes.
- Macaroni and cheese?
- I don't care much for it. Thanks.
I could defrost a T-bone.
I'm trying to cut down on red meat.
Much obliged though.
- Waffles?
- I had 'em for breakfast.
Campbell's tomato soup?
I've got a bridge game tonight.
Margaret's waiting now.
It's Jake.
He wants to talk to you.
- What about?
- I don't know. He wouldn't say.
- I'll give him a couple of minutes.
- Good.
- What's the matter?
- He just wanted to talk to you.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- After you.
- Thank you.
Surprise!
Happy birthday, Murphy!
I'll be damned. Nobody's thrown me
a party since I went to war.
- Which war is that?
- The Crimean.
Margaret, you are
guilty of duplicity.
I was so afraid you wouldn't go riding
today and just show up at my house.
- Did you plan this?
- Well, actually, Emma and I...
Margaret and I have been cooking
this up for a week. We thought you knew.
No, I'm bowled over.
- Bessie, who's minding the store?
- It's shut up tight.
And I don't wanna hear
another word about it.
- You logged in another one, buddy.
- And they're starting to come faster.
- You still got your hair.
- Yes, I have.
But I lost my gallbladder.
Everything evens out.
- Aren't you going to open my present?
- Sure, Jake.
And we've got punch.
We've got some cake.
Margaret, would you serve the punch?
Could I talk to you
in the kitchen a minute?
Yeah. Jake, here.
Do this in a few minutes.
- Here. Let me.
- Thanks.
Just put it on the table
over there.
This has become
sort of a second home to me.
You kept me fed and warm.
I want to thank you for it.
- I think you should get married again.
- When I'm ready.
- When will that be?
- One of these days.
- Somebody around here?
- Probably.
Then I'll have to give you
another party.
I'll let you know when.
Okay, Murphy, this is it.
Now, how many of these
do I put on your cake?
How old are you?
Just set the damn thing on fire.
A can of car wax from Jake.
Thank you, son.
- You know what I need and what I like.
- You're welcome.
- Here. This is from me.
- Let's see what we got here.
A black tie.
Well, thank you, Freeman. That's going
to come in real handy at funerals.
Margaret's cherries.
Nobody puts them up better.
Well, be careful.
There may be a few pits in there.
All right!
Look at that.
There you go!
- You gotta get it in one go.
- All right.
Come on! Come on!
Go! Go! Go!
- Do you want to cut it or shall I?
- No, I'll slice it.
I've known some of you
since I was a boy in this town.
I kissed Margaret behind the barn
when I was eight years old.
Learned some of
the possibilities of life.
I got some of
Freeman's blood in me.
He came up with a pint or two
when I needed it.
My friends have overlooked
my shortcomings.
Seen me through some dark days.
Brightened up the rest of them.
I'm glad to have 'em. I'm honored
to have 'em. I'm lucky to have 'em.
- Now who's gonna take the first slice?
- Me right here.
Thanks.
Okay.
Bend your knees,
or you'll get a hernia.
Oh, Bobby! That's no fair.
You get off me!
God!
Get off me.
That's what hay's for...
to have a roll in.
I seem to be allergic to...
something.
How come you're
picking me up from school?
- 'Cause I want to talk to you.
- You saw the dish I broke.
-No, I didn't.
-That's 'cause I glued it back together.
That's why I didn't see it.
I'm going to ask your dad
to leave the house.
What'd he do?
We're not married anymore, and we
can't live together like we're married.
He wants to.
So he's going?
Yes.
I wanna walk home.
You sure have had
a short childhood.
This is Larry,
and this is Linus.
They're twins, and they're mine.
It's kind of funny.
I keep getting boys.
Oh, Emma, this is Wanda.
And she's a friend of mine
from Tulsa.
It's a long way to drive
with two babies.
Yes, ma'am.
Please just call me Emma.
Are you a day over 17?
I'm 18.
How come you got pregnant?
There's a drugstore on every corner.
Forgot to do something.
He's always in such a rush.
Well, they're going to need
a last name, aren't they?
I guess.
That's up to Bobby Jack.
Why don't you
do yourself a favor?
I hope I don't have
to do this again.
Take a class
in shorthand or typing.
You never know when you might need it.
Here. I'll take him.
Well, I just want to stay at home
with my babies.
Well, at least he likes kids.
Don't take my head off.
This is not one of your traffic tickets
you can just tear up.
L know. I know it.
We had a heat wave,
and the temperature was, like, 103.
She's wearin' one
of those little tank tops and...
we started licking off
the same ice-cream cone.
I really don't
wanna hear the details.
There you go.
I can see you settin' your jaw.
Emma, nobody is perfect.
Bobby Jack,
you've never even been close.
But I haven't had
enough good times yet.
The party's over, my friend.
Somebody just handed you the check, so
pick up the tab for once in your life.
Does everybody have to put
their head down and slog?
Most people do, yes.
Sell your motorcycle.
Sign a lease on a house.
Put some money in a college fund.
But I'll always love you, Emma.
- How'd it go?
- I'm never gonna get married.
Yes, you are.
Some girl's gonna find you and never
let you go, 'cause you're such a plum.
This is Larry, and this is Linus.
Or, this is Linus, and this is Larry.
I don't know which.
They're your brothers.
Have a seat.
Say bye-bye. Bye-bye!
Jake, you keep lookin' in that mailbox.
There will be something there for ya.
Bye-bye!
Make me something, Murphy,
and talk to me.
How about a chocolate soda?
All chocolate.
He came by on his way out of town.
Bought some diapers and baby powder.
I'm in such a funny mood, and I don't
even know where it's coming from.
What'll I do with my life?
Get on with it.
Should I get rid of the ranch?
Should I dye my hair or put an ad in
the singles columns? What? Tell me what.
You're a big girl.
I've done a lot of dumb things
in my life.
I married too young.
I married the wrong guy.
- Never went to college.
- Spilt milk.
Give me some advice.
You know a lot.
- You've lived a long time.
- You want advice? Write Dear Abby. "
You got problems?
Take them to your local minister.
Your head isn't on straight? The mental
health clinic's in the phone book.
I'm not a lifeguard. I don't put up
bail. And I'm not your damn Dutch uncle.
Now, if you don't know
how things are...
you're not as smart
as I thought you were.
- Good evening, Murphy.
- Good evening.
It's going to be
a lovely night, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
- Did you have a nice ride?
- Yes, I did.
It's going to be
a handsome moon tonight.
- Think it's gonna rain?
- No, it's dry this time of year.
- Are we talking about the weather?
- You are.
That's not what I wanna talk about.
Take another tack, Emma.
I don't know what tack to take.
I'll help you.
Separate the men from the boys.
I show some wear.
I don't deny it.
But if the fruit hangs
on the tree long enough, it gets ripe.
I'm durable.
I'm steady, and I'm faithful.
And I'm in love
for the last time in my life.
I'm in love for the first time
in my life.
So?
So...
stay to supper?
I won't do that unless
I'm still here at breakfast.
How do you like your eggs?
I'm 60.
The end.
