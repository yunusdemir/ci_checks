Hm.
- <i>Arsenio Hall!</i>
- Woo! Woo! Woo!
Team Two take the prison.
We get the villa.
Little Sister, this is Big
Brother, we are in the ballpark.
Big Brother, Little Sister.
We're at the prison.
<i>Little Sister, Big Brother.
Are you in position?</i>
Big Brother, Little Sister,
affirmative. Attack in 30.
Starting now.
Hm!
Ooh! Ooh!
Ah, ah. Ooh.
<i>Six...</i>
five, four, three, two...
It's an ambush!
Alka-Seltzer!
Whoa!
Ahh!
<i>Big Brother! Harbinger,
where are you?</i>
Ahh!
Ahh! Ah! Ah!
Ah! Oh!
<i>Surrender, Yankee infidels!
You have no chance.</i>
Off to prison, American Satans.
Americans were shocked by the
announcement of the failure
of yet another mission to rescue
hostages from the Middle East.
Informed sources reveal that the
rescue team itself has been captured
and added to those
already being held.
Reports also indicate that
an attempt on the life
of a terrorist dictator was
thwarted at the same time.
<i>With the election 10 days away, it may
be a setback for the White House.</i>
<i>Presidential challenger
Senator Gray Edwards</i>
<i>commented on the failed mission.</i>
This is no time for
partisan politics.
Bringing our people home
should be our priority.
<i>Despite this crisis, the president
put on his best political face</i>
<i>continuing on his
campaign schedule.</i>
<i>Benson's 20-point lead in
the poll six months ago</i>
<i>has plummeted since the
hostage crisis began.</i>
<i>The CNN/Victoria's
Secret catalog poll</i>
<i>has the president and Edwards
running neck and neck.</i>
<i>Today, Benson made a brief
stop in Fergus Falls, Virginia</i>
- <i>for a groundbreaking of a library.</i>
- You took my baby!
<i>The five living former
chief executives</i>
<i>Presidents Bush, Reagan,
Carter, Ford and Nixon</i>
<i>were on hand for the
groundbreaking ceremony.</i>
<i>Correspondent Jeri Kelter reports
on this historic moment.</i>
The library is to be built near
the Fergus Falls Civic Center.
- President Benson made no statements.
- Oh! My knee!
Publicly, he seemed unaware of the
political blow he had been dealt.
Privately, aides marveled at his spirit
as he performed his morning routine
by milking the White House goats
and eating two helpings of
grapefruit and creamed corn.
<i>Tonight, the president and his top
advisers will burn the midnight oil.</i>
Sabotage.
My God, man, what does it mean?
We must tighten security, sir.
Find out who's behind it.
No, no, no. The word "sabotage."
What does it mean?
Someone's subverting
our mission, sir.
One of our own may
be aiding the enemy.
Come in!
Mr. President.
Oh, Jesus! Don't you ever sneak
up on me like that again.
What is it, Bob?
If Edwards hears of this,
he'll use it against you.
- He'll try to prove you're incompetent.
- I can prove that too.
Mr. President, the CIA can't
afford another failure.
We'll send Colonel Walters
to get our people.
To ensure success,
we need Topper Harley.
We've located him in the Far East.
Topper Harley.
We've served together before, sir.
There's no one better.
- Cookie?
- Not me, sir.
- Young lady?
- No, thank you.
No, no, I was just
offering him a young lady.
Oh, yeah, Topper Harley.
Good. I love the boy.
Kid's got guts.
There isn't a fighting man
on this planet that can...
Gotcha! Listening at the door, huh?
Well, Walters, looks like
we've got our saboteur.
That's your wife, sir.
Huh! Yeah, so it is.
Lavinia. You're looking as
lovely as the day we met.
Find out what she knows.
As for you, get me Topper Harley.
Hm?
Gummi Bears, Gummi Bears!
Sprinkles, sprinkles!
Gummi Bears, Gummi Bears!
Sprinkles, sprinkles...
You fight!
Aisle 5, mezzanine, to your left.
Get your program
right here. Program!
One pig snout sandwich.
Both fighters are showing
signs of fatigue.
They aren't moving
around the ring as much.
Hey, this is where your
conditioning pays off.
Coochie-coochie-coo. Coochie-goo.
You win!
Topper, Topper, Topper, Topper...
Topper Harley!
Mmm.
Topper.
I don't believe it.
- Topper.
- Colonel.
- Good to see you again.
- Yeah, you too.
You want to tell me about it?
Well, they let me live here.
I help out fixing things.
It's peaceful. Quiet.
No one is allowed to talk.
And that dim sum fighting
in the warehouse yesterday?
I do that for the extra money.
And to satisfy my male
cravings to kill and win.
Colonel, who are they?
She's CIA.
- The other man's an extra.
- Ah.
What does she do?
Heads up Middle East
covert operations.
Reports directly to Benson.
Colonel, these men have taken
a supreme vow of celibacy.
Like their fathers
and grandfathers.
They haven't seen a
woman in decades.
Miss Huddleston!
Ow! Ow! Ow!
This is Michelle Huddleston.
Topper Harley.
Pleasure.
- You're not easy to find.
- Why are you keeping track?
It's like the colonel says:
Good men are hard to find.
I don't know what you
know about the last war,
but some of our men
were missing in action.
On two occasions we sent in
squads to rescue those men.
Both squads failed.
We must get the men who went to get
the men who went to get the men.
- I'm here to make sure we succeed.
- What's this got to do with me?
I'm going this time.
- We want you to go with him.
- Why me, ma'am?
Because you're the
best of what's left.
My war is over.
Mmm... Ah!
It's a few extra dollars now.
But you'll make that back
on your heating bill.
We're gonna caulk the ashram
if you want to stop by.
Thanks, Bob.
This mission's important. We've
got to take care of our people.
Come with me.
When are you gonna put
Ramada behind you?
- What are you saying?
- You say your war is over.
Maybe the one out there is,
but not the one inside you.
You running from the pain
won't solve anything.
Because wherever you go,
you take the pain with you.
You've come an awful
long way to lecture me.
You were hurt when that woman left.
You're using that to hide
from who you really are.
- That was a long time ago.
- Thank you. Next!
I don't want it.
Nice butt.
Topper, let me tell
you a little story.
It seems there were three bears.
One day when their porridge was
too hot, they took a walk.
A little blond girl
skipped through the woods
and she ate their porridge
and sat in their chairs
and slept in their beds.
And when those bears returned
and discovered that mess...
- Do you know what happened then?
- No.
That little blond girl got scared.
Ran away.
So, what you're saying is,
that little blond girl is me.
So I should color my hair...
Topper, they didn't make
you this fighting machine.
They just cooked up the
porridge and went for a walk.
You won't stop running until
you face your three bears.
Ramada.
Colonel.
I'm sorry.
It has to end for me sometime.
If you should change your mind
here's my 900 number.
It's $5.00 a minute.
I'll waive the charges.
<i>your three bears.</i>
<i>Ramada. Ramada. Ramada.</i>
<i>If our lips should meet
Inamorata</i>
Don Corleone.
<i>Kiss me, kiss me sweet
Inamorata</i>
<i>Hold me close
And say goodnight</i>
<i>With a love
As warm as wine</i>
<i>I'm at heaven's door
Inamorata</i>
<i>Want you more and more
Inamorata</i>
<i>You're a symphony</i>
<i>A very beautiful sonata
My inamorata</i>
<i>Say that you're my sweetheart
My love</i>
<i>You're a symphony</i>
<i>A very beautiful sonata
My inamorata</i>
<i>Say that you're my sweetheart
My love</i>
Hey, what's wrong, kid?
I love you so much.
But it's such a crazy world. I don't
want anything to happen to us.
Don't worry.
In a few days, we'll be
on the train to Hawaii.
We'll find a minister to marry us,
and we'll never be apart.
But if something
should keep us apart?
If one of us can't make it
to Blenheim Train Station?
Like, for instance,
if something came up unexpectedly.
Not that I think it would.
Or it already has.
Wherever I'll be, I want
you to know that...
Kiss me.
Kiss me like you've
never kissed me before.
You will denounce the criminal acts
against our people by your president.
Sign here. Initial
here, here, and here.
Phil!
Sign the document.
I see you're no stranger to pain.
I've been married.
- Twice.
- Oy!
<i>Like the previous six, this victim
was found folded neatly in half</i>
<i>inside the glove compartment
of a sanitation truck.</i>
<i>Police are baffled.</i>
<i>This just in.</i>
<i>Presidential military adviser
Colonel Denton Walters</i>
<i>has been captured during an aborted
attempt to free our hostages.</i>
<i>This tape was delivered
to us just moments ago.</i>
<i>They are treating me good here.</i>
<i>The food is tasty and nourishing.</i>
<i>The peaceful leader
of this country</i>
<i>has asked me to appeal
to you, Mr. President</i>
<i>to stop your vicious, imperialistic
tactics around the globe.</i>
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please give a warm welcome</i>
<i>to His Excellency,
the Prime Minister of Japan</i>
<i>Mishahuru Soto and Mrs. Soto.</i>
<i>The president of the United
States, Thomas Benson.</i>
Mr. President, this is Prime Minister
Mishahuru Soto and Mrs. Soto.
President Benson,
where's your first lady?
I don't know. I've had lots of women.
Lost my flower at the age of 15.
I can't keep track.
Let's get this over with.
I feel ill.
My intestines were removed during
action in the North Atlantic.
Took a torpedo in the gut. My
bowels were replaced with hemp.
- Clogs easily.
- I hope you feel better.
Well, my lips to yours.
<i>The junior senator from
Minnesota, Gray Edwards.</i>
President Benson,
Prime Minister Soto,
ladies and gentlemen.
Tonight we put election
politics aside as I join you
as majority whip and chairman of
the Foreign Affairs Committee
in welcoming the
Japanese prime minister
and his lovely wife to
these United States.
Our two great nations have begun...
what we hope will be a long
and successful dialogue.
Ptooh!
- Not only...
- I don't remember eating that.
I feel better now.
It's that raw fish odor.
It makes...
Oh, God.
Look at that! Those my teeth?
Only to continue in
the highest spirit...
Yeah. They're filthy!
And so I would like
to propose a toast.
- Oh, thank you, Yoko.
- I'll take that, sir.
To world peace.
To a clean environment.
To harmony with our planet
and world prosperity.
Thank you.
Looking for a place
to sit, lieutenant?
I must talk to the president.
Can you arrange that?
- You'd be amazed what I can do.
- It's my fault they got Walters.
I want to go in.
You showed up just in time.
We leave in the morning.
I'm taking charge of this mission.
You mind working under a woman?
<i>And now, the president of the
United States, Thomas Benson.</i>
Prime Minister Tojo,
Senator Edwards,
my fellow Americans and our
millions of illegal aliens.
It seems like only yesterday
I was strafing your homes.
Here I am today, begging you
not to make such good cars.
Excuse me. I need a glass of water.
Damn tongue's dry.
It's not mine, you know.
Lost mine in Laos. Little
commie lopped it off.
It's probably a doorstop somewhere.
Got this one from a basset hound.
Get the car.
President Benson.
No, you're not.
I've seen him. He's older,
about my height.
Sir, this is Topper Harley.
Topper. Yes, of course.
Son I never had.
Well, no damn wonder
I didn't recognize you then.
Word of advice, don't call
yourself the president.
I wouldn't, neither should you.
It doesn't hold water.
For that matter, neither do I. Let's
get away from these power cables.
- I'd like to join the next mission.
- God bless you, boy.
This one's on the QT.
It's called "Secret Mission to
Get Walters and Our Boys Back."
When you come back, I'm gonna
throw you wonderful guys a party.
And there should be plenty to eat.
I doubt more than half
of you will return.
Thank you.
Got a light, lieutenant?
I quit smoking.
Besides, I don't think
it's allowed here.
What are they gonna do,
arrest me for smoking?
- I know what to get you for Christmas.
- A Thighmaster? I've broken three.
Really?
Let's go to my apartment
and discuss our mission.
I'm putty in your hands.
In my hands, nothing
turns to putty.
<i>Tonight's the night we're
gonna make it happen</i>
<i>Tonight we'll put all
other things aside</i>
Hmm.
<i>Give in this time and
show me some affection</i>
<i>We're going for those
pleasures in the night</i>
<i>I want to love you</i>
<i>Feel you</i>
<i>Wrap myself around you</i>
<i>I want to squeeze you</i>
<i>Please you</i>
<i>I just can't get enough</i>
<i>And if you move real slow</i>
<i>I'll let it go</i>
<i>I'm so excited</i>
<i>And I just can't hide it</i>
<i>I'm about to lose control
And I think I like it</i>
<i>I'm so excited</i>
- Hm?
<i>- And I just can't hide it</i>
<i>And I know, I know, I know, I know</i>
<i>I know I want you</i>
<i>We shouldn't even
think about tomorrow</i>
<i>Sweet memories will
last a long, long time</i>
<i>We'll have a good time,
baby, don't you worry</i>
<i>If we're still playing around,
boy, that's just fine</i>
<i>Let's get excited</i>
<i>We just can't hide it</i>
<i>No, no, no</i>
<i>I'm about to lose control,
and I think I like it</i>
<i>Oh, yeah</i>
<i>I'm so excited</i>
- Oh.
<i>- And I just can't hide it</i>
<i>No, no, no, no, no</i>
<i>I know, I know, I know, I know</i>
<i>I know I want you</i>
<i>I want you</i>
<i>Ooh, boy</i>
<i>I'm so excited</i>
<i>And I just can't hide it</i>
<i>No, no, no, no, no</i>
<i>I know, I know, I know, I know</i>
<i>I know I want you</i>
<i>I want you</i>
<i>I'm so excited</i>
<i>What you do to me
I just can't hide it</i>
<i>You've got me burning up</i>
<i>I'm about to lose control
and I think I like it, yeah</i>
<i>I'm so excited</i>
Yippee! Woo-hoo!
Yippee-ki-yay! Woo!
<i>In an emotional address
at the state capitol</i>
<i>Nebraska Governor, Paul Burmaster,</i>
<i>made a public apology for
his state being so flat.</i>
Where are you?
I don't know.
What's wrong?
My arm's asleep.
No, something else.
My leg too.
Please, you can tell me.
Well...
Topper.
I have to wee-wee.
Look, I told myself last night
was just going to be last night.
I guess I just never counted on
finding a guy so deep, so sensitive.
I've fallen for you, Topper.
I've fallen for you big time.
There's someone else, isn't there?
I have no idea what you mean.
Women sense these things.
I said there's no one.
I'm fine.
I know about Ramada, Topper.
I read your dossier.
She must be quite a woman.
And what if she was?
Was?
<i>Last call for Train 590 for Glendale,
San Francisco and Honolulu.</i>
Board! Board!
I told you. Warned you twice.
Harley.
- Topper Harley.
- Right here.
<i>I cannot go with you
or ever see you again.</i>
<i>Just believe that I love you.</i>
<i>You must be brave, my darling.</i>
<i>This card is printed
on recycled paper.</i>
Sergeant pick that up.
Someone could trip over it.
Which one of you is
Michelle Huddleston?
She is.
I'm glad you're here. The
hostages are being moved.
I'm Commander Armin
Harbinger. I'm in charge.
Sorry, commander.
Presidential orders.
We're in charge now.
- Any questions?
- No, ma'am.
Harley, I've been there.
I've seen the enemy. If you're
not ready, you won't make it.
I've fired a couple of guns.
I'll assemble the men,
with your permission.
Gentlemen, Ms. Huddleston, CIA,
and Lieutenant Topper Harley.
We're working for them.
Williams, com sync pac ram set
MOS 92-H tact op spec patty-wack.
- Patty-wack?
- Give a dog a bone, sir.
Of course.
Rabinowitz, demolition. Can't wait
to blow something up for you.
I look forward to it.
Commander Harbinger advised me we
have 11 hours to free the prisoners.
After that, we may
lose them forever.
This is the prison camp area.
It's heavily guarded, but they won't
expect an attack from the jungle.
Your contact, code name Bench
Press, will lead you to the camp.
I'll meet you at the
rendezvous point.
Good luck.
Topper!
I know we haven't had
much time together
but when you go into battle,
take something of mine with you.
Your lucky mole.
Topper, what are you reading?
<i>Great Expectations.</i>
- Is it any good?
- It's not all I hoped for.
Know what I'm gonna
do if we make it?
I'm gonna go back to Eagle River
and marry my gal, Edith Mae.
Gonna get us a nice little place
with a white picket fence.
You know the kind.
Two-car garage.
Maybe a fishing boat.
And in 15 years, when
they're all paid for,
I'll set my charges and
blow the shit out of them.
You got a girl, Topper?
Penny to Sky King, no parents
in sight. Party is on.
Green, green, green...
Hook up.
Geronimo!
Geronimo!
Me!
Ahh.
Thanks, brothers.
Jeez!
Stop it!
- Ramada.
- Topper.
- What are you doing here?
- This is Bench Press, our contact.
- I didn't know.
- You know each other?
Yes. Yes, we do.
It's been a long time.
- Let's see, the last time we met...
- Was The Flurvian Sea.
- You remember?
- I remember every detail.
The sky was blue. You wore gray.
I was in chiffon.
Topper, there's so much to say.
You're as pretty as
when you dumped me.
You've changed.
That beauty mark.
It was a... It's a gift.
Very touching, but it's
no time to reminisce.
We must be at the rendezvous point in
seven hours or we miss our pickup.
It's your show, hero.
Let's move out.
Follow me.
We're late. I know a shortcut.
- The meat's smoking.
- Shut up.
- Let's take it off the grill.
- Leave me alone.
- Frank, you're drunk again.
- Whose fault is that?
This is the best way to
the prison compound.
They see many boats,
so they won't be suspicious.
There are clothes
in the wheelhouse.
<i>Somebody once wrote, "Hell is
the impossibility of reason."</i>
<i>That's what this place
feels like. Hell.</i>
<i>I hate it already, and it's

Hello, Lucky. Report my signal.
<i>Report my signal. Over.</i>
Hello, George Mike Walters.
Strength three. Over.
<i>Recon reports Indians on the
Warpath in your area. Over.</i>
No Indians here. Over.
Do not take literally. Repeat.
Do not take literally.

the carcass. Repeat.
<i>The vultures are

I see a couple of gulls, but...
Pit bull's out of the cage.
Crips are raiding the store.
Hey, you yanking my crank?
They see a woman, they will
know we are masquerading.
Only men are allowed
to do the fishing.
Topper.
Why did you have to come here now?
Of all the missions
in all the jungles...
- ...you had to walk into this one.
- I tried to stay away.
I thought I'd never see you again,
that you were out of my life.
But it's a sequel. I had to come.
Do you know what
the critics will say?
- "Same warmed-over characters..."
- Topper, stop it.
You're only using this whole
casting thing as an excuse
to hide what's hurting you.
Hurt? Maybe. Once.
But I knew this day would come.
I knew one day you'd
come crawling back
begging for forgiveness.
Groveling, sniveling,
pleading for another chance.
Sorry, sweetheart, but this all-day
sucker is down to the soggy stick.
No, Topper, you don't understand.
I'm married. I was married
before you and I ever met.
I'm still married today.
- You're joking.
- I'm not.
- You've got to be.
- If I was joking I would say,
"A horse walks into a bar. The
bartender says, 'Why the long face?"'
You are married.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I thought he was dead.
He worked for the CIA,
training pilots in Germany.
Highest security.
They told me he died
over Villenshtoben.
The day before we were to go
I got word he was alive,
in a hospital in Berlin.
I had to go to him.
They ordered me not to tell anyone.
- I know how you must feel.
- You do, huh?
You know how it feels
to have your heart shot
and tied to the hood of a car?
To be passed like a
large kidney stone?
Ramada,
I don't think so.
Patrol boat!
Remember, we're not American.
These boys aren't stupid.
Where's Harbinger?
Shut off your engine.
Shut off your engine.
We're boarding.
Hm.
Kareem of Onion! Al Jarreau!
Go on! Get out of here!
Take that to the bank and cash it!
Swim for shore!
Save yourselves!
Swim for it! I'll catch up.
Go!
Omar Sharif!
Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo!
Whoa!
Topper?
<i>President Benson is returning
to Washington today</i>
<i>to speak to the nation in
what experts are calling</i>
<i>the pivotal address of
his political career.</i>
- How is the speech coming, sir?
- Hm?
Oh, I'm practicing my A's.
- This look like an A to you?
- Yes, sir.
All right.
What's that, Bill?
We just received word from
Michelle. Harley is missing.
- His boat has been demolished.
- Oh, damn it!
Every time I give an order,
it gets screwed up!
Plan a reception,
wrong hors d'oeuvres.
Appoint an ambassador,
he leaves the country.
Mr. President, we need a plan.
This may be our last chance
to get the hostages out.
All right.
Here's where we are and
here is where they are.
- Oh, Jesus. Oh, God.
- Oh, no time for prayer, Bob.
- Here's the target area.
- That's Minnesota, sir.
Damn it, man, that's
the genius of my plan.
Why go over there to fight?
We can do it right here at home.
- Sir, the enemy is over there.
- Then we'll fly them over here.
Their families too. We'll
teach them to skate...
- Do I have to think of everything?
- But the hostages!
It is imperative that you act now!
Topper?
Whoooaaa.
Topper! You made it!
That's right, Cindy, it's
23 minutes past the hour.
And now here's the Buckinghams
with <i>Kind of a Drag.</i>
You're bleeding.
I'll be all right.
Something else bothers
me a lot more.
Harbinger, where were you
when the patrol boat arrived?
Below, sweeping the boat for bombs.
What are you accusing me of?
Nothing, yet. But I want
you to know I smell a rat.
Don't push me. Before you
bagged your first babe,
I was slitting throats
for a living.
I'm not saying I don't trust you,
and I'm not saying I do. But I don't.
Save it for the enemy.
We got a job to do.
Oh, look. I'm cut too.
Oh.
They got me too.
It's a real gusher.
Let's get going.
There's a guard at the gate.
He's mine.
Wait here.
Topper.
- Topper.
- Jesus!
Before we go in, you
should know something.
- What now?
- Have you heard of Dexter Hayman?
The freedom fighter?
Yeah, he won the Nobel Prize for
inventing the artificial appendix.
Exactly. Dexter is
one of the captives.
- He's my husband.
- You've got to be joking.
If I was joking, I would say,
"A rabbi, a priest and a
minister walk into a bar..."
Okay, he is your husband.
Topper, I was so young,
just a schoolgirl.
He was an older man, so wise
in the ways of the world.
He used to come around the
schoolyard, day after day.
I so admired his persistence.
Even the restraining order my parents
slapped on him was no deterrent.
He opened my eyes to the arts,
music, clog-dancing, WrestleMania.
His work has meant
so much to so many.
And I owe him everything, Topper.
Everything.
I'm happy for you, kid.
But if you think you can hurt
me again, you're wrong.
I left my heart in my other pants.
Go.
Oy!
Ah!
Cock-a-doodle-doo!
Ah!
Mm!
Cock-a-doodle-doo.
The Iraqi coast.
Oh, those bluffs look treacherous.
Hadn't counted on that.
But if God is on our side, we will
rendezvous on Lincoln's wart by noon.
That's it, men.
We're going in!
<i>My rescue mission was underway.</i>
<i>But two things kept
running through my mind.</i>
<i>Would we get to the men in time?</i>
<i>And why did I bring
helium instead of air?</i>
I'll go to the rear.
Take the front door.
The keys.
- What?
- Enough!
I'll have a hamburger.
- Where are the prisoners?
- There.
- Let's go!
- I'll take the back gate.
Now, that's a hell of a gun.
- Where's Dexter Hayman?
- Villa compound 405.
Okay. I'm here.
"Terrorist Mountain."
"It's a Small War." "Pirates
of the Persian Gulf."
"Hostage Mover."
Ah! "Dexter's Dungeon."
Harbinger, what are you doing here?
I was right, wasn't I? You
sabotaged the other missions.
- I find that unacceptable.
- You got me wrong.
All these years,
fighting, and shooting and killing.
I just... I can't go on. I...
Hey, hey, hey, rainy face!
Hey, proud warrior.
Let the sun come out,
you big bad G.I. Joe.
You know, kitten, we all have
permission to make mistakes.
It's called "learning."
You give your Uncle Topper
a nice big blow.
I'm done.
Thattaboy.
Thanks. I can kill again.
- You've given me a reason to live.
- Good.
Head for the gate. Plenty of
bad guys to shoot on the way.
<i>Keeps going, and going,
and going, and going.</i>
<i>Nothing outlasts the...</i>
<i>Oh!</i>
Yes!
There's a copter pad
half a mile away.
- That's our ticket out.
- We can't leave. Not without Dexter.
Topper! Watch out!
For a moment there,
I thought you were...
Gabriella Sabatini?
I get that all the time.
It must be the nose.
Ironically, I haven't picked
up a racket in years.
You saved my life.
Topper, no matter what happens,
I want you to know that
I never stopped loving you.
Let's move out!
You know how to get
to the copter pad.
If I'm not there in 15,
you know what to do.
- We get the hell out of here.
- No! Wait another 15 minutes.
<i>We could hear gunfire
from the compound.</i>
<i>From out of nowhere,
a patrol boat appeared.</i>
<i>How would we get past the
soldiers on that boat?</i>
<i>Then, suddenly, it happened.</i>
Take cover!
Guys.
Jeez!
That's it, good night.
War. It's fantastic!
Drop the gun!
Drop it!
You will die, Yankee bastard man.
How you say? Like a dog.
Now march!
March!
I kill you where you stand,
you imperialist Yankee-Doodle dork.
Slippery rascal!
Butcher of Baghdad. Hello?
Well, hello.
Who is it? Who is it?
- Your wife, Hillary Rodham Hussein.
- Jesus! I'm so stupid!
I was supposed to pick her up.
Tell her I'm at the gym.
No, I'm out of town.
On business. Bombing,
gassing, execution.
- Something. Make it up.
- I'm sorry. Just missed him.
I owe you one.
Ali MacGraw! My eyes.
You little...! I'm going
to split you like a melon!
Now I will kill you
until you die from it.
In a pig's ear.
- Mr. President!
- Suffering succotash!
Looks like the upper hand is
on the other foot, Saddam.
Ah-ha.
Uh-oh!
Yes!
My skin's made of asbestos.
Tanning parlor accident
at Dien Bien Phu.
Go on about your business. I got
a bone to settle with this guy.
Yes, sir. I'll get Dexter.
Let's make this a fair fight.
I've been waiting
for you, O Big One.
We meet at last.
The circle is complete.
- Now I am the master!
- Only the master of evil, Saddam.
Your powers are...
Your powers are weak.
You shouldn't have come.
Well, I have. We'll settle
this the old Navy way.
First guy to die, loses!
Water. Water! Water, please.
- It's locked. From the inside.
- No!
- Damn it!
- We're gonna die!
- Get ahold of yourself!
- Blow it!
- It's not our property.
- Do it. Do it!
Oh, Mr. Geppetto!
Go ahead. Shoot. You'll
get nothing from me.
You are filth. I spit
in the face of filth.
- I've come to get you out of here.
- You're American.
Yes, from America. Let's go.
My friend, I yearn for
freedom as much as anyone
but I run from no man.
You've got to come with me.
I can't walk.
They've tied my shoelaces together.
A knot.
Bastards.
I'm aborting the mission. Envelope
is closed. We're lifting off.
Here you go. It's $4.50.
I didn't think you'd make it.
Onboard. We're getting out.
What about the others?
We just can't leave them.
Wait! I can't go any further.
I need a drink.
Okay. Right a bit.
Whoa, stop there.
Down a bit, down a bit. There.
It's not very cold. Is this filtered?
Their artillery will be down
on us soon. We have to go.
No! We'll lose Topper and Dexter.
But that's been the idea all
along, hasn't it, Michelle?
You're looking beautiful as ever,
Ramada. How did you know?
I didn't. It all came
together when I saw you here.
I remembered your
inscription in my yearbook.
You wrote, "Remember the
fun we had in class"
"and I'll fuck up your life
if it's the last thing I do."
And then I realize where
I had last seen this.
What could I have done to
make you so vindictive?
Goodness sake. You know each other.
Oh, Ramada, how could
you have been so blind?
You were too wrapped up in being
Miss Perfect College to notice me.
Why concern yourself with the feelings
of one insignificant roommate?
One fabulous day,
one incredible experience.
I had no idea it meant
so much to you.
I remember that day as
if it were yesterday.
The exhilaration of experimenting,
sharing something so new,
so dangerous,
- so intimate.
- Go on.
And I'll never forget
the look on your face.
The way the sweat glistened
on your hard body.
Then you tied my ankles.
Tighter. Tighter.
But it just wasn't right.
It wasn't natural.
Bungee-jumping is just
too dangerous a sport.
Bungee-jumping? That's it?
How could you hurt so
many innocent people?
Oh, Ramada! It was
always so easy for you.
How could you understand?
I had Dexter imprisoned because
I wanted you to suffer
- as much as you made me suffer.
- You fool!
When I discovered I couldn't
win Topper because
he loved you, I tried
to have you killed.
He... He still loves me.
You turned your back on America
because of your jealousy.
You're gonna pay for this.
Good doggy!
Ew.
Ah-huh!
Aluminum siding. Ten-year
guarantee. No paint needed.
Hm.
Do you have any idea
where you're going?
Ha! You missed!
It'll take more than that
to stop me, you devils!
Don't jiggle me.
Advil! Midol! Get over here!
To the helicopter.
They clicked with
the wrong dictator.
This means war!
You better let me handle this, son.
Ew. You're so sweaty.
- I knew you'd make it.
- It's about time.
- Michelle.
- She's our saboteur.
Can you get me off
for old times' sake?
Sorry, precious. You sold out the
greatest country in the world.
And to think I wore your mole.
Get her out of here.
Dexter?
Ramada.
Oh, dear Dexter. Look what
they've done to your shoelaces.
Oh, my darling. You've no idea
what I've just been through.
But now we're together again.
We have much to look forward to.
I want to do it all.
<i>Donahue. Geraldo.</i>
<i>Sally Jessy.</i> Oh, and who's
that black chick...?
- <i>Oprah.</i>
- Yes! Yes. Her too.
Let's go! It's getting hot here.
I'm going back for the president.
Topper!
I'm staying here with you.
Get on that helicopter with
Dexter, where you belong.
Why? I thought you loved me.
Ramada, I do love you.
I've tried to forget you
but no matter what, your face
is on the tip of my tongue.
Then let me stay with you.
Ramada, I want to be with you.
I want to hold you.
Meet your parents and pet your dog.
My parents are dead.
My dog ate them.
I'm sorry. We both know
you belong with Dexter.
You're part of his work,
the thing that keeps him going.
I'm not being noble, but do you have
any idea what'd happen if you stay?
Of course I do.
Sex. Wild, free, passionate,
unbridled sex.
I'd fondle you in ways
you can't imagine.
I would pleasure you at any time,
in any place, in any way,
for as long as you
could possibly desire.
You better get going.
You'll miss your takeoff.
Goodbye, Topper. God bless you.
Wait, let me get a shot of you two.
It'll be great for the talk shows.
Let's frame this up.
Closer together.
Come on. Don't be shy.
Put your arm around her.
I've almost got it.
This is a great shot.
My God, you're gonna love this!
You know, under other circumstances,
you'd make a great couple.
Oh, well. Say che...
You're moving too much.
Quit spinning!
This'll make me rich and f...
- He really was a wiener!
- Don't get me started.
Hold it there! Hold it!
This buggy going to America?
I was afraid we'd lost you!
Lost? Not a chance.
Shove over! I get the window seat.
- They're in my sights.
- Just a second! This is personal.
We're too heavy.
We need to lose weight.
