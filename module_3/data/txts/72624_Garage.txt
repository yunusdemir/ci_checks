Josie.
Sorry Mr. Gallagher
What are you sorry for ?
Nothing,
only I went for a walk.
Well that's not a hanging offence.
Stretch out the hip.
Are you opening up ?
I will.
Will you do a bank run for me today Josie?
- No bother, boss.
- Good man.
I'll send Nancy down later on to let you off.
OK - OK, sound.
Good man.
I'll get a few jobs done before she gets here.
D'you know what I was thinking Mr. Gallagher...?
What were you thinking Josie ?
About the oils...
Go on.
Well, I was thinking...
The 'Castrols' are lost here in the shop..
they shouldn't be in the shop here,
stuck on a shelf
Right...
They should be out beside the pumps,
maybe just alongside the door.
The last day the rep was here,
I was just saying it to him. Just talking -
and he goes out to the car
and he brings in this stand
 - and give it to me.
Free and all !
I was just thinking of moving them out there today
Hello? No, fire ahead.
-stacking them out there
I can bring them in again at night.
- Sorry, what ?
- No bother.
- It might help.
- Josie, I'm on the phone !
Right, sorry boss.
- No, no problem.
Go on.
- We're set so.
- Indeed we are set. We're set
we're ready for anything.
Josie?
Yes, Mr. Gallagher ?
I was thinking of keeping her open for
a few extra hours at the weekend.
Thursday to Saturday like.
- Right.
- Til 10 maybe?
Til 10...
Evenings are bright now,
people are passing.
- They are, they're passing through.
- Houses are flying up around the lake.
- They are.
- What do you think ?
Would it suit you ?
- Oh God, no bother Mr. Gallagher, no bother.
- I wouldn't have you on your own now.
- No no, God no
- Are you sure?
- That's fine with me Mr. Gallagher.
- Good.
You're a great man, Josie.
Oh, God, yeah.. ! Mr. Gallagher? Mr. Gallagher?!
- What is it ?
- Will I move them oils then ?
What ?
Them oils, onto the new stand,
what I got off the rep
- Over there, next to the pump, or out there...
- Whatever you think yourself, Josie.
Whatever I think myself...
True!
Right, Josie, move the oils.
Now...
You keeping well ?
Dead moving things?.
- Are you ?
- I am.
- Making improvements.
- Go on !
I moved all them oils there, see?
Next to the door,
on the stand.
Me and Mr. Gallagher were
talking about it for a while.
So I got the rep to give me a stand a few days ago.
Looks great.
I'll take them in at night
and move them out again in the morning.
Right.
Mr. Gallagher hasn't seen it yet.
Well I'm sure he'll be delighted Josie.
- So are you off again ?
- Aye, I am !
You're always going someplace.
- Or coming back.
- That's the name of the game, Josie.
- So where to, this time ?
- Bruges.
Go away! Bruges...
Lucky man!
You reckon?
I do, reckon.
Lucky man...
You've a strange idea of lucky, Josie
I do.
Hauling a truckload of dead chickens
to Belgium.
Yeah, nice to see other places, mind.
Roads are the same everywhere, mate.
True.
- And the women !
- The same everywhere.
- That's what ye all love.
- Who ?
Truckers.
- Is it?
- Them streetwalkers.
- Tramps inside in the cab.
- You see...
you know me too well, Josie.
I do, I know you.
Inside the cab !
- Sure I have a great life.
- You do.
Only don't be telling the wife, yeah?
Jesus no!
When the cat's away...
The cat's away, Josie !
- In the cab...
- Best hit the road.
Boys, oh boys !
Right so, on off!
- Bye !
- Safe journey, see you when you get back.
- Give all those Dutch women my love.

Carmel...
What has you traipsing the town ?
- Doing a bank run.
- Right.
Booking something ?
Thinking about it.
Be nice, lying out...
Oh, yeah !
In your swimming bikini.
Come on in now Josie, til I get rid of you.
- I'll have to tell you my news.
- What?
- We're going late above.
- Really?
Weekends only.
Are you having a party Josie?
God, I'm not, no - just a few
bits and pieces for my tea.
€3.05 so.
You're never in Duignan's anymore Carmel?
No, I haven't felt like it.
- Thanks
Is Breffni around?
He's in there all the time sure.
Bye, Josie.
Carmel.

No thanks Carmel.
I'm not that pushed on apples.
Go on, they're free.
No..
-Go on !
Aren't they on the turn anyways?
Right...
Half rotten, like the rest of us.
I might make an apple sauce for me chop.
Good luck.
Hey, Horse!
Do you want an apple horse ?
Hey, Horse...
Hiya horse, do you want an apple ?
Do you want an apple horse?
Good, good horse !

Mr. Gallagher sent me down.
Now.

Josie. Right.
I'm going to work here weekends.
Oh right !
Aren't you very good.
We'll be kept busy anyways.
There's a great passing trade nowadays..
passing...
Is it OK if I wait here ?
He said he'd pick me up.
No bother.
Right, I'd better go inside.
Finish the last few jobs.
You still open Josie?
- I waited til you came down.
- Good man, I'll ...
I'll send him along to you so on Thursday.
Great!
- And you'll show him the ropes ?
- Oh I will indeed.
- Good man.
- Now...
Josie, this is David's mother.
Vivienne, this is Josie.
Pleased to meet you ma'am.
And you.
Fine day.
It is.
Right, we'll head so.
We'll leave you to it, Josie.
See you Thursday so, David.
Open !
Blasted spoon !
Now...
will we go out ?
We will.
Come on Josie !
Switch off.
Do we have keys ?
We're set.
What did she die of anyways?
- Boredom, probably.
- Right !
No, no, 'twas total...
body cancer.
Fucking hell!
She was riddled.
- You should have been a doctor, Josie.
- I should.
How are things above ?
Good now, good.
Tell us,
what's new in petro-chemicals ?
- Busy.
- Really?
We're going late now at weekends,
picking up.
- Go away !
- Are ya?
They mentioned something about it
on Sky News alright...
People passing by and we decided...
Fuck it, sure !
Exactly.
Houses flying up around the lake
and we decided...
Can I just ask you one thing Josie?
- What ?
- Who's "we" ?
What ?
I was just wondering like..I didn't realise
you had a stake in the business.
"We"...
Mr. Gallagher...
Oh that's better.
That "we" !
Yeah.
The royal "we"? !
True enough.
Alright Breffni, Josie.
A pint there, Val.
- You alright for a pint, Bon ?
- We're fine.
You nearly missed it Sonny.
I'd say I did and all. What?
Josie was giving us his
five year plan.
For fuck's sake!
Weren't you, Josie ?
Just! Now...
Tell him, Josie.
Go away now... the craic..
What ?
We're opening late above at the weekends,
Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays.
Good man !
But have you heard Tom Gallagher's plan yet Josie ?
You're an awful messer !
Go on, you must have been consulted.
Now...
Alright, here it is, five year plan.
Get some fucking idiot to look after
your garage for ya
That's the easy bit, isn't it, Josie ?
Now...
Sit on it, don't invest..
like not a fucking dime!
Then when the time is right, knock it down
and start building apartments.
And just fuck you out on your ear!
The weekends just.
A rising tide lifts all boats,
isn't that right?
except for Josie's there.
Would you relax, Breffni.
Throw on a pint for Josie, Val!
No I'm grand Breff..
Go on, Val.
I'm going out for a fag.
Awful messer!
Cold enough!
It is... cold enough now.
Things food with you Josie ?
Now...
Good enough ?
Good enough.
What's eating Breffni inside?
Ah sure, grand... a bit of craic...
I don't know why I come in here sometimes.
A few pints.
I'd go mad otherwise, I suppose.
Stone mad...
We've brought you your wage slave.
Shut up !
Josie, this is Declan.
I know him from town.
David's a blow-in.
He is.
Eh, I have a name too?
This is Louise.
Hallo. Right, we'll get started ?
I'll show you round.
And then €8.90...
for the can of oil.
And hit "Misc" and then "Total".
It says "€28,90" there. That's your total.
You got that ?
Right, I'll just void that now.
"Void".
For fuck's sake,
will ye stop hanging around !
- We're only trying to help.
- Just go !
Come on, Declan.
Catch up with ye later.
Yeah...
We'll be down at the tracks later.
I'm not going down the tracks .
I'll find ye.
- Sorry.
- Grand.
- The pumps...
- Right...
A lot of people are used to
self-service these days.
That's not here.
We're a valet garage.
Valet !
Anyways, the pumps are
old and contrary.
I don't like to see the punters using them.
Only break them they would.
The pumps...
Now, we'll see...
You're open ?
We are.
Statoil isn't.
Is it not ?
No, it's closed.
Now...
Well... give us 20 euros so, Josie.
Fine.
I'll do it.
Right.
It's round the far side.
He's my assistant. I'm training him in.
Grand.
- He has the hang of it anyhow.
- True.
We take in those oils every night
....inside.
We take 'em out again in the morning.
Right....Will I make tea?
- Would you like tea ?
- No thanks.
Are you sure ?
- Have you coffee?
- No, no coffee.
I'm grand so.
I don't really like tea.
I'm not that fond myself,
only now and again...
I make it.
You're alright ?
Yeah
Would you have a Fanta, ? Instead ?
No thanks.
Go on...
I'm grand...
It's free now.
I'll have a Fanta so.
Fanta is right...
Good man!
Thanks, Josie.
That's better now!
Who was that ?
I don't know, just wanted petrol.
Grand says you...
- He came to the right place.
- He did.
Yeah !
Right...
Great colour in the sky all the same!
Beautiful !
It is... beautiful.
Will I put the shutters up ?
I'll get that. You head away.
Thanks.
I'll get the last few in Duignan's now.
Grand.
Thanks.
Thank you.
David...
Wipe down them tables, Lee,
like a good girl.
Lovely sky tonight!
- Was there?
- There was.
Beautiful...
No sign of Carmel ?
Licking her wounds, Josie.
True.
Can I get a few cans off you there Val ?
No problem.
Hello, horse.
How are you?
Were you waiting up for me ?
I've got you something.
You're a good boy.
That's a good horse.
A good old hungry horse.
Sully !
You alright ?
What has you here ?
Taking care of some pups.
Right.
A nuisance !
The bitch was caught by Tierney's collie
when she was in heat.
I could have strung the bastard up by the balls.
Bad enough !
I seen him pumpin' her out the
back window, but...
I'd no shoes or pants on, so I couldn't get to them quick enough.
Damage done.
Fucking right.
I gave him such a kick in the hole.
Bad bastard !
And she produced, five of them.
Pure awkward!
Pure annoying !
And the kids is all soft on them.
Always the way.
- Shitting everywhere.
- I know.
- So this is the best way now.
- A kindness.
Tell them they went off down the country somewhere.
Aren't you right?
So we're heading off next Thursday anyway.
Are ye? Where to??
- We're heading to Trabolgan.
- Go way!
Oh yeah, we're there every year.
Sure 'tis fantastic.
- Is it ?
- Ah the kids go mad for it.
Swimming pools and wave machines and
bowling and bars...
- and fucking great!
- Great.
And they'll have forgotten about
them boys when they're back
They will, Sully.
They will. Pups...
- Done.
- Stopped?.
Fine. I'd better go Josie,
in case anyone sees me here.
Right you are.
Say nothing to no-one, you !
Oh Lord, no !
The kids would never forgive me,
if they knew I done that.
It's for the best.
Poor bastards...
Thanks.
We'll close up so.
Cool.
Work done.
You can head away now.
Maybe catch up with Declan maybe.
Nah, he's off with Louise.
Hangin' off each other.
Do you take a drink, David?
Sometimes.
When I can get served.
Well I've a few cans inside.
Yeah ?
Only if you like.
I'll be having a few myself anyways.
Help me sleep.
Sure we could drag the chairs
round the back out of harm's way.
It's still bright.
Only if you want now?
Cool !
Right... cool.
We'll take in the oils so.
Did you always work here Josie ?
Long time.
For Mr. Gallagher ?
After his father died.
I was in school with him.
Same class.
And he was good to me now.
The town looks out for its own, David.
It does, I'd say.
You never wanted to leave ?
No....could have.
Yeah?
But I didn't.
England.
Had a job lined up in Ipswich, and all.
Really ?
Yeah. A cousin of mine was a
renderer in a meat factory there.
Set me up with something.
Could have been nice.
Could,
but then I stayed.
-Will you have another ?
-Yeah
If you're able for it now ?
-I drink.
-Right.
What do you make of Louise, Josie ?
She comes from nice people.
She annoys me.
her father is a chiropodist.
And her mother was Dunne from outside the town.
What ?
Her mother was Dunne,
her family was Dunne.
Her family name was Dunne .
She was 'done' from way back !
Do you have any more cans left, Josie ?
Plenty.
Hey Dave ! Workers of the world unite !
We got beer, man.
- Fucking A !
- Just lager.
Not Special Brew or anything,
or cider either.
- Great !
- Cider doesn't suit everyone.
Did ye buy them ?
No they're Josie's...
we have them for after work.
Do we owe you Josie ?
No, they were cheap anyways.
How would you pay anyway Declan ?
Out of your pocket money ?
- The fucking worker !
- Yeah, the fucking worker...
Are you having a can, Josie ?
Do.
I will so, I will, thanks.
Sit down Josie.
I can't.
The hip and all,
if I sit down I'll never get back up.
Stuck, down!
There...
Does everyone know Josie ?
He's fucking sound !
D'ya want a cigarette ?
No, I have my own, thanks.
Well...
-Josie!
- How was the trip ?
- Same as all the others.
Good...
I've got something for you Josie.
Something for me ?
You got a video player in there ?
I think there's one inside.
Never used,
nor the telly much.
I'm more of a radio man myself.
Here.
That should keep you busy
for a few minutes.
Some dirty... !
They were giving them away.
What ?
It's all gone DVDs innit?
In a basket, in a shop.
Dirty bugger !
You enjoy yourself, Josie!
Aul' bugger !
- I've been looking for you.
- Were ya? ?
Do you want a lift?
I'm heading out to the lake.
Great.
We can have a chat. Get in.
Let you put the blanket on the back seat,
the dogs are shedding.
Do you still have all the dogs, Mr. Skerritt ?
Oh, most of them.
Are you keeping well ?
Oh, no fear me.
And yourself? Are you keeping well ?
Grand.
Well you're looking well anyways.
- Yeah
Ah Ben don't !
Come out of there! Ben, come back!!
Ya hoor ya! !
Ben ! Come back here !
Come back here, will ya? !
Fuck !
I come out here a good bit
on me own now.
Do ya?
Yeah.
I used to come out with Senan,
when he was a little fella.
Now...
-Yeah!
Before she took him.
Just out by the water there.
Walking, or dropping a line.
Fishing...?
-Yeah.
Pike. Aul' pike.
- Or eels.
- Aye !
Pike or eels,
and he loved it!
Never caught a pike here meself now.
Pike...
Hard old fish to clean, pike.
Full of bones.
Loved it...
I only ever caught eels here now.
Right...
I'd a great run of eels one time.
I'll never forget it.
I kept them in a bucket in our yard.
Four days...
tying themselves in knots...
'til they died.
Then I threw them out.
Dirty oul' things !
You're keeping well, anyways.
-Ah!
Dirty oul' things !
Sorry... I'm bad some days.
Now...
You think it's going to stop.
It never stops !
There's some building in town,
isn't there ?
Ah to Hell with the town Josie !
There's no such things
as towns anymore.
I'm sorry Josie, I'm heavy.
- Ah now...
- Sorry.
Nice here anyway.
Yeah.
Nice...
And you're a great man to listen to me.
Thanks.
You were good to me in your time.
Pike...and eels...

Bleached.
Noeleen, below in the salon.
Burned the fucking head off me.
Now !
See my hairline is all red.
'Tis raw alright.
She thinks it makes me look like a whore.
It does make you look like a whore.
Do you think I look like a whore, Josie ?
Oh God no ! Not at all !
Same again, Val.
Is she alright, Carmel ?
Grand !
What has her so drunk ?
You wouldn't know yourself
and you selling us drink all day !
Well I don't think it's right
having them children there and her like that.
What do you want her to do?
Leave them at home ?
Regina !
Run over there and ask your mammy
is she matching collar and cuffs.
Regine, you'll do no such thing.
Here, take these over to the table, lovey.
Great to have you back in anyway !
I knew you'd be back though...
..you're like a rubber ball !
I wouldn't piss on you now Breffni,
if you burst into flames.
Pauline's very bad.
Sure Bosco's gone again.
Is he ?
Moved in with the girl of the Taltys.
Go way !
Sure neither of them'd hold on to a man.
I can't get pissed tonight,
whatever's wrong with me.
I hate that meself.
It's bad.
I haven't even danced yet.
I'm pure bad at dancing.
Why ?
Are you offering ?
Come on, so.
The only offer I've had all day.
Sorry, my big feet.
Shut up.
You smell nice, Carmel.
Whatever it is...
Perfume ?
It's only oul' roll-on.
Deodorant, like.
Is Pauline alright since ?
Pauline is never alright.
Only I heard Bosco left.

So, she's OK so ?
-Yeah.
You're pure soft, Josie !

No impression, Carmel.
Listen to me !
I'm going to do a kindness on you now.
Right.
You're a grand fella, Josie.
Ah...
Pure soft and nice.
Ah now..
But I have no interest in you.
Not like that.
Sorry now.

We're heading..

Yeah.
We're not open yet.
-Josie.
It'll take me five minutes.
You're the busy men this hour
on a Sunday morning!
It'll take me five minutes.
We're not looking for anything,
only we need to talk to you.
- Oh..
If you want to pop in the car there
we'll drop you over to the station in town.
Right, only I have to open,
open the garage...
Mr. Gallagher...
Don't mind about that... and the lads here
will have to make a search of your rooms, Josie.
Oh God, yeah.
Here now...
Here...
Do you have an idea

- No.
Let you in so, we'll head over.
Thanks, Michael.
-Josie?
-How are ya.
Alright Josie ?

Right, sit down there a minute Josie.
Hi, Chris.
Is room four available ?
Right...did Martina Neville
call in, by the way ?
- Be with you in a minute Josie.
- Grand.
What?
Ah she was supposed to drop in
her tax and insurance.
Well if she does ring, tell her I'm
working here til six
and she'd better get her arse down here !
- Right. Come on, Josie.
- Ready.
- Can that window be opened?
- I don't think so - 'tis jammed.
It's boiling.
'Tis.
Now...
Now...
You have a young fella working for you..
with you, in the garage? ?
-I do.
-David?
-Yeah.
Well, we've had a complaint, Josie.
About David ?
Do you know what age he is ?
Any idea ?
15, I suppose.
-Right.
Did you show him indecent material Josie?
What ?
Did you show him a 'blue movie' Josie ?
Not like that.
You did ?
Only messin'.
Lads' stuff!
He's 15, Josie !
This is what this is about ?
There's been a complaint.
About me ?
And did you supply him with alcohol ?
What ?
Did you buy him drink, Josie?
We'd have cans, like...
Cans ?
After work.
Some cans.
No harm, like.
Just a few cans.
Like we all did.
15...
Innocent now.
Will people know I've been arrested, Michael?
You haven't been arrested Josie.
You're just making a statement.
- But would people know like?
- I don't know. It's a small town.
Right.
We'll just wait to see if the lads pick
up anything at the garage and if not,
I'll drop you back.
Thanks, Michael.
We'll see how things pan out from there.
Right.
I could say sorry to David.
I'd like to tell David I'm sorry.
No harm intended....and sorry, like.
Send a letter.
I could send the mother a letter...
Tell her I'm sorry and no harm done.
Nothing like, just innocent oul' craic is all.
It was stupid.
Josie, listen to me now.
Stay away from them, do you hear me?
Things is bad enough without
making them worse.
Stay away.
Sorry.
I'll just have to copy this and see
how the lads are getting on.
You relax there for a while.
You could drop me off here Michael.
I'll walk the rest of the way -
stretch out the hip.
Stay away from the boy now Josie.
I will.
It wasn't him that complained.
Only he said it to a pal and
then word got round and
then his mother heard.
- And stay out of the town Josie.
- I will.
- We'll be on to you at some point.
- Right. Sorry.
- You keep the head down.
- I will.
Your keys Josie !
Sorry.
Horse !
It'll only take two minutes now.
You sure ?
I'm sure.
Strong ?
No, no, not too strong.
I hope this milk is alright.
Do you think it's alright?
It says the 29th.
I'm sure it's grand Josie.
There's spots in it. Damn !
Now...
It's fine, Josie.
I'll get them out.
Only a few spots.
That's an awful nuisance.
