<font color=#0000FF>Jane!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Jane!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Jane, it's me! Open up.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Did you tell anyone?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Did I...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>About the name. The name?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Yeah, I told Rick.
He thought it was funny.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Just Rick and nobody else?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>No.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Why, what's the matter?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Larry, what's wrong?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I'm sorry.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You have no idea how sorry I am.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Larry, you're scaring me.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What are you doing?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Rick!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Ricky!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Rick, the name!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Janey!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Did you tell anyone? Anyone!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Larry, please, please! I...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Rick, he's coming!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>The name!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Giselle. I told Giselle!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I'm going to stop you!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Giselle!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Larry...
- Mom!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Who did you tell?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>He killed them!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Don't think it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Mom, come on!
- Don't say it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Don't think it. Don't say it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Don't think it. Don't say it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Don't think it. Don't say it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Giselle! Did you say the name?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Don't think it. Don't say it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Don't say it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Don't say it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Who did you say the name to, Giselle?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What the hell are you...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Larry!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What's up, playboy?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- How's it going?
- Good.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Today is a good day.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- You got the key?
- No, it's under the mat.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Oh! Come on.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>It's only 20 minutes.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>This is the first time he's rented the place.
The guy says it's fantastic.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What else would he say,
"It's a dog house"?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>No, I'm trying to convince her, let's go.
Come on, man, work with me.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Sash?
- Yeah. I'm up for it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>It's a little creepy. Right?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Nah, it's just cold.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Heat's off.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I've got to piss like a race horse.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Cute.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Dude, this place is sweet, bro.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Hey.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Right?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>We could put the desk over there.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>We could put the bed here.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Well, maybe if there was a bed.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I know, the landlord said
it was fully furnished.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Yo, El, come and check
this out, man. This is crazy.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Come on down.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Yo, El, come in here, man.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>See, you can't get this
in the dorms, right?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Now, that's classic.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>John, you really think Sasha
wants to see that, or that?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You got the whole upstairs
to make girly, okay?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- I've definitely seen bigger.
- See? You're awesome.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Bro, she's awesome, man.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Oh, yeah, you guys must've been
hilarious when you were young.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>"Must've been"? Are.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Tier 1.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Hey, he made me look smart,
and I made him look ugly.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>But after the crash, he took care of me.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Talk shit about my
boy's folks, you're done.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Okay, when the Tier 1s are both ready</font>
<font color=#0000FF>to cook and clean and help me
do this place up right.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>'Cause I'm not going
to be your guys' maid.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Of course not. I told him. Right?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Well, I never cooked you
my butter pasta-nette.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>That is not a thing.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- That's 'cause I invented it.
- Okay.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>And I clean, too.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I promise.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Yo, what does this do?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Yeah, you cook.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Yes, I cook, okay? I don't bake.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Found the furniture.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I've heard about you and all the girls.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>And that's exactly why we need
to get out of the dorms.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>This is perfect.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Whoa. Easy.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You all right?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Yeah, thanks.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>So, it looks like
the landlord wasn't lying.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Wow.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Damn, son.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Hey, I like this.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Ow. Fuck.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>So?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Don't you want to?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Well, yeah, yeah. I do. Now I know you...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Yo, all the dishes in here, they're white.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Just saying.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>He touches everything.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>It's up to you, Bear.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I can't afford it without him.
I know you can, but I don't...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Elliot. Elliot.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Yeah?
- We're doing it. Obviously.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Yeah?
- Yeah.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I see she approves, huh?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Hey, you need a hand?
- No, I got this.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Okay, don't break yourself.
- Better than going to the gym, right?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Hey, Elliot?
- Yeah?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Hey, did you hear that banging?
- Yeah.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>The radiators sound worse.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Okay, Bear, here it is.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Rilke says, "Coins symbolize
the wonder and terror of fortune.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>"Do you land face up
or face down in the dirt?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>"What home will you be born into?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>"With whom will you fall in love?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>"Fortune is truly like a coin
tossed by the hand of God."</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I'm wiped.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Hmm.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Thanks for finding me that quote.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You wanna watch something stupid?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Mmm-hmm.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Just us, yeah.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I'm gonna brush my teeth.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Hey, what's on the bed?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>"You look like a model from the '70s.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>"The personal pilot of
a James Bond villain.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>"A 19-year-old koala bear person."</font>
<font color=#0000FF>"If any of them were true,
I wouldn't have you.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>"But they're not, and I do.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>"Amazingly.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>"Bullshit aside,
I never thought I would meet,</font>
<font color=#0000FF>"let alone be with, anyone like you.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>"With so much love,</font>
<font color=#0000FF>"Your Knight, Beau, Casanova
and new roommate, Elliot.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>"No animals were harmed
in the making of this card!"</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Hey, Elliot, that's not funny!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Elliot?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Hey.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What's wrong?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Hey!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What's up, man?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Oh, Little brother!
- How's it going?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Look at this place. Fantastic.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Hi, darling.
- Hey.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Hi, Uncle Elliot!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Hey, Niece Alice!
- Hey, hey.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Hey, there.
- Hey.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Sorry we're so early,
your brother's pathological.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>It's called being prompt and professional.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Virgil's awesome.
- Thank you.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Oh, hey, I almost forgot.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Here's your housewarming present.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You going to help me drink it?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>No!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Look at this.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>So, a house off-campus with
John Henry and a live-in girlfriend.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You ready for this?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>She's the one, Virgil.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>She did all this herself.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>That's great, it's just,
you know... Be smart.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Be a student, man.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>It's the last time to have
no responsibilities. Enjoy it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I don't want that. I want what you have.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>An amazing wife, an amazing daughter.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Well, just don't rush it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>That's all out there waiting for you.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Believe me, what I have is great. It is.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>But I missed out on all this.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I mean, what a college edu-ma-cation
could have done for me.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You have a scholarship, man.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You should be upstairs studying right now.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Jesus. It's a good
thing you're not jealous.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>It is good.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Come on, man, you got this. You got this!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Come on, come on, come on. Come on.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>All right, all right.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Baby!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Bam! Thank you! Thank you!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>An oldy-old gold coin, huh?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Yeah, I put it back on the little table
next to the bed.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I didn't want to keep it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>It's 'cause you're the best, most honest,</font>
<font color=#0000FF>smartest, cutest, heaviest,
oldest person here.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I'm not the heaviest, or the oldest.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Dad's the oldest and he's the heaviest.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>She ratted me out.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Here.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Head-bump.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Fist-bump.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>That's John's room, we're upstairs.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>All right, we're out of here.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Buddy, great party.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Be good.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Bye, guys. Bye, Alice.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Kim? She's in my Lit class.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Girls who wear hats inside
are crazy, you know that, right?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>She's going to do a psychic
cleansing after everyone leaves.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Cool, can I leave, too?
- No.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>She's just gonna burn some sage,
and you are going to be nice.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Maybe you need a hat.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>It's a twist-off.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Oh, thank you.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>John, do you think this house is creepy?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Mmm.
- Yup.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I don't, but I'm not a girl.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>And I think you should get dressed,
'cause we're playing baseball.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Why do jocks always have
to play games, even at a party?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>"Don't think it. Don't say it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>"Don't think it. Don't say it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>"Don't think it. Don't say it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>"Don't think it. Don't say it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>"Don't say it. Don't think it."</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Miss Sasha steps up to the plate.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>She's going long! She's going long!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Okay, all right, all right. You got this?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>All right.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Oh! Yes!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Oh, you all right?
- Yeah.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You're drunk.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>So, you thought
there were sounds and what?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- "Bad vibrations"?
- Yeah.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>And now if they're gone,
then what's the big deal?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>We burned all that bad shit away, right?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>That's tight.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You're actually psychic?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Sensitive, my mother says.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Oh, "Sensitive," huh?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>So, what, your mom locked you under
the stairs when you were a kid?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You shoot knives at her.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Yeah. No.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>But I could find stuff.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I always knew when people were
coming over to the house.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You know what I'm thinking?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Yes. I might just do that.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Damn, you are psychic.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Sensitive there, for sure.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Elliot...
- It's okay, Sasha.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>People have doubted me my whole life.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Elliot, you can go ahead</font>
<font color=#0000FF>and live a sheltered, shallow,
physical existence.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Well, a non-physical existence
would be kind of tough.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What Aristotle is trying to say is...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Well, he needs proof.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Yeah, is that crazy?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Okay, let's just take some deep breaths.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Okay.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>So, if nothing happens,
I should believe, 'cause it means</font>
<font color=#0000FF>you got rid of the spirit.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Elliot, come on.
- What?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>We all know you don't believe
in this stuff, okay?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>But can you just please let her do it?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Right. Sorry. No being rational.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I give over. I do.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Yo, El, just loosen up
the grip a little bit,</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I'm trying to concentrate on my breathing.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Are you ready, ladies?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Okay, let's do this thing. Come on.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Now, I have no ego about it,
but I do know this stuff.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Okay, cool. Well, what do you know?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Okay.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I know your parents died in a crash.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Dude...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>He didn't tell me.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>They did.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Bro, I didn't say anything. Swear.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I would never tell anyone that.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>They're worried about you, though.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>All right, I'm sorry I laughed at you
before, but that's not funny.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I'm not being funny, Elliot.
This is just what I'm getting.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Okay, how did they die?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What kind of accident was it?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Your brother will do anything
in his power to protect you now.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>But they worry that
he's taking on too much.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>All right. So, you talked
to my brother tonight.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Sasha, your...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Your grandmother has some
biscuits or rolls or something.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Gam's Rolls?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Come on, everybody's grandma
bakes biscuits.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Yeah. He's not wrong about that.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>This is... This is... You know what?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You want to blindfold me, too?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Just hang on.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I'll take you up on that, though.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I'm all down for the blindfolding,</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- whatever you got...
- Of course.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Okay, what'd I hide? Where'd I hide it?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Oh, come on. That's crazy.
- Elliot...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Shh.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You know what? I...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I don't like this.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Yeah, I don't want to do this anymore.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Maybe this was a bad idea.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Nah, come on.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You're a good faker, I admit it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You put the keys in a pot on the stove.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Did you?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You heard.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You were listening for it, weren't you?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Well, I didn't hear that, did you?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>No.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Something's coming.
- What?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>They're saying,</font>
<font color=#0000FF>"Don't...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>"Don't think it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>"Don't say it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>"Don't say it. Don't think it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>"Don't say it. Don't think it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>"Don't say it! Don't think it!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>"Don't say it! Don't think it!
Don't say it! Don't think it!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>"Don't say it! Don't think it!"</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Don't say or think what?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>The Bye Bye Man.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Jesus! What the fuck?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Kim! Oh, my God.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Hey...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- What happened, Kim?
- Kim?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Are you all right?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Sorry.
- What are you doing?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Nothing. Nothing. Sorry.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Are you sick?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Good night. Love you.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I love you, John.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Hey. You're joking, right?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Sasha, you're kidding, right?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What the hell is that?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Come on!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>John, let's go!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Look, I'm trying...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Like this?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Hey.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Shh.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- What are you doing?
- Do you hear that?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What the hell is that?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You ready?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Thanks for being nice to me last night.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>That was pretty crazy.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>It was. Definitely.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You want to go inside?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>My roommate's car isn't here.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>We could try again.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>These things happen, right?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Actually, not to me, they don't.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Yeah.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Actually, not to me, either.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>A guy not finishing up,
I've never had that happen before.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Come on.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I'm hungry.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Jesus.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Nothing.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Nothing, okay?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Kim, I need to go.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Now.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Fuck.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Dude, check this out.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>They were already there, right?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>No.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>It was Colin or one of
those douches from last night.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>No, listen, I heard it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I heard something after
the party outside, scratching.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What do you mean, you heard something?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Morning.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>See, you are clean and beautiful.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>That's nice.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What was that?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- John, you drive Kim home?
- Yeah.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>And now I gotta wash her off.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>The girl's gross, man. Total pig.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Come on, man, that's not cool.
Don't say that.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Oh, sure, yeah, it's easy for you to say.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Your girlfriend is perfect.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Oh, God.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You okay?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I don't know, maybe I shouldn't be
playing baseball in the cold.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>That's the problem
with being an alcoholic.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Oh, shut up, I didn't
even drink that much.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Maybe that was the mistake.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I'll make you some tea.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Come on.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Fuck him.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Bear, you went away there for a second.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I did?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Yeah. Where'd you go?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>God, you're shivering.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I was just thinking.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>About John?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>No, little brother, it's cool.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You can call me any time, you know that.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Are you really taking on too much?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Are you worried about protecting me?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What is going on?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Is it Sasha?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Yeah, she's been really sick and scared.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>And John's been acting weird.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You guys seemed like you were great.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Were we? You saw them dancing together.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Talk to me, buddy, what's going on?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Elliot?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You wanna go get lunch
tomorrow or something,</font>
<font color=#0000FF>we'll talk about this then?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You know what, listen, I gotta go.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>There's something I gotta...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I gotta deal with something.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>El...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Guys?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Guys, what are you doing up there?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Hello? Anyone down there?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Hello?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Hello?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Guys! Help!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>No!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Guys!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What are you doing, Elliot?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- You were here the whole time?
- Yes.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>That's bullshit.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>But we were, Elliot.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You didn't answer me.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- We didn't hear you!
- What were you doing?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Studying, talking...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- You didn't hear me? You didn't hear me?
- We weren't doing anything.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Elliot, for the last time, bro,
we wouldn't do that to you!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Why are you lying to me?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- We're not!
- Jesus Christ.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Then what just happened, huh?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>And there were sounds... I mean, come on!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I told you there was something happening.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Now do you believe me?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Hey, don't worry, okay?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What are you doing? Don't do that.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Don't do what?
- Don't...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Elliot...
- No, no, no. Don't touch her.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- What?
- Don't touch her!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You are a crazy paranoid, bro!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Yeah, you're a little warm.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Okay, so you weren't with John.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Am I hearing things? Am I seeing things?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Tonight you thought the house
was empty when we were here.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You went away, Elliot.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I kind of went away, too.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I sat down to study...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I don't remember doing any of that.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>It's like now that I know his name,</font>
<font color=#0000FF>he's coming for me.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>And the more I try to get rid of it,
the bigger it gets.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>It's horrible.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Hey, babe.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Bye Bye Man's not real.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>It's just something that's in our heads.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>That's real.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Ideas are real.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>If it's not,</font>
<font color=#0000FF>then, Elliot, we're all losing
our minds at the same time.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>And what are the chances of that?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- What the hell is that?
- What is it?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Elliot, there's nothing here.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>So, you're not going to be late, right?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>No, I'll meet you at 2:00 sharp,
right where we parked.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I'm going to find out how real
this thing is. The name...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You're going to talk to the landlord
about the furniture?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>And the house.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Maybe he can find somewhere else.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You're feeling better, though?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I guess.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>It's hard to be scared
in the middle of the day.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I'm going to take care of you.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Oh, my God.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You're shivering.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I'm going to figure this out, I promise.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I'll see you at 2:00.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I love you.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>"Register Archive. Dead File 69. Redmon."</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Here, put these on.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Really?
- Yeah.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>They're originals and we don't want</font>
<font color=#0000FF>your sweaty palms messing up
the documents in the box.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Now, the dead file has dead articles,</font>
<font color=#0000FF>material that got
killed before going to press,</font>
<font color=#0000FF>but still saved for posterity.
And it was written by Redmon.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Thanks.
- Mmm-hmm.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Thank you, Dennis.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Mr. Daizy?
- Yes, how are you doing?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Not so great, actually.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Uh, me and my friends</font>
<font color=#0000FF>are renting your place</font>
<font color=#0000FF>out in Sun Prairie. 37 Oakdale.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Oh, yeah, the two handsome guys.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Are you with them?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You have a weird house, Mr. Daizy.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Really, it's awful.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Well, I'm sorry that you feel that way,
but they did sign a lease.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Bless you.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Sorry.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- You okay?
- It's really cold in here.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>It's a hothouse.
It's actually not cold at all, honey.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Maybe you should be home in bed?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Look, Mr. Daizy.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>There was an old nightstand
in the basement.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>And it has this writing inside it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Where did it come from?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>A nightstand?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Let's begin by considering this wall...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Now, we can all agree that the sentence...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Sorry.
- Yeah, have a seat.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Now, we can all agree that this sentence,</font>
<font color=#0000FF>"This is a wall," is a truth claim.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>This wall is real. I see it, you see it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>We can touch it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Likewise, if I were to brush
a few atoms from this wall,</font>
<font color=#0000FF>it would still be here.
It would still be here before us.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>It would still be "the wall."</font>
<font color=#0000FF>But what if I continued</font>
<font color=#0000FF>to slowly brush the atoms,
one by one, away from this wall?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Well, at first,
you'd say it's still a wall.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I brush a few more,
well, it's still a wall.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>But what if I remove every single atom
from this wall except for one?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>And you've seen me brush
every single atom from this wall</font>
<font color=#0000FF>except for that one atom,</font>
<font color=#0000FF>and I point to it, and I say,
"There, that's what's left."</font>
<font color=#0000FF>That's the wall.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Now, is it?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Is that the wall?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What the...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>All right, John?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Welcome back.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Language and reality</font>
<font color=#0000FF>inform each other as we construct...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Okay, I'm looking up
The Bye Bye Man, right?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>There's nothing online, so I type in,
"Don't say it, don't think it,"</font>
<font color=#0000FF>and it led me here,
the dead archives and Redmon.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Here's what was in his folder.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I think you write it and repeat it
to try and keep from saying...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>The Bye Bye Man.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Okay, but why is that in the dead files?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>"October 18, 1969, byline, Larry Redmon.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>"Deerfield, Iowa.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>"A teenager, accused of murdering</font>
<font color=#0000FF>"his own family and four other youths.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>"When asked by this reporter why he
would do such a thing, he replied,</font>
<font color=#0000FF>"'The Bye Bye Man made me do it."'</font>
<font color=#0000FF>It's an article about
a kid who went crazy.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>But it was never published.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>And Larry Redmon, the writer...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>He was pretty infamous locally.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>After he killed this piece
about the kid in Deerfield,</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Larry Redmon took a shotgun</font>
<font color=#0000FF>and murdered eight friends
and family members</font>
<font color=#0000FF>right here in Madison.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Don't say it. Don't think it.
- Mom!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Don't say it. Don't think it.
- Mom!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Don't say it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Mom, shut the door!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Giselle! Who did you tell?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>No one! We didn't tell anyone, Larry!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Mommy!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Stop!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>We didn't tell anyone!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I swear we didn't say anything!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Get back! Please!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Maybe he got inspired by
what he was writing about.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You won't win.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I won't let you.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>There are no other mentions
of these cases anywhere else.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>It's like someone redacted the whole story,
so no one else could read it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Why would anyone do that?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Well, obviously he was bat-shit crazy.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>But, if you remove all references</font>
<font color=#0000FF>to something in the past,</font>
<font color=#0000FF>that past no longer exists.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Even the idea of it is gone.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Maybe somebody wanted to make this
Bye Bye Man disappear permanently.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>And you've got the
last record of it right there.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I'll be back.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Good, I have time.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Don't write it either, idiot.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What are you doing, boy?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Are you out of your mind?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I, um...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- What is wrong with you, Elliot, huh?
- What the...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I'm sorry, I need to go. I'm late.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Elliot!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Oh, my God.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Sasha!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Hey, John!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Sasha!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Hey.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Hello.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Kim, it's Elliot.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Elliot... God, I was just
thinking about you guys.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- You wanna come up?
- Listen. Listen.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Um, what are you doing?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You mean, right now? Or since the party?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Isn't that why you're here?
- Kim, can you come down?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I want to do another séance.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Right now, with all
four of us, at the house.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Listen, you were right.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I was wrong.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Sure.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I'll be down in a sec.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>The Bye Bye Man doesn't exist
anywhere else that I could find.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You don't have to look for him, Elliot.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>He's found us.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You can't help thinking about him.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>And the more you think about him,
the closer he gets.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You see things that aren't there.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You don't see things that are there.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Or hear things.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Like a coin rolling.
- Yeah.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Like a train.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Some people catch it and it spreads.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Some go crazy sooner,
but they all die in the end.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>The word spreads
and he comes to you with...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>With that thing.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I told Katie.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I didn't want to.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What can you do with
cancer but cut it out?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You have to stop it before it
spreads and every cell dies.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>This could spread everywhere
if we don't cut it out.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Did you tell anyone?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Ms. Watkins, the librarian.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>We have to get to her, too.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What do you mean, you have to get to her?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Stop!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Oh, my God!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Stop! Elliot, stop!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Let me help you!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Kim! Wait!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Kim!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Kim! Kim!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>No!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>We have to help them!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- What do you see?
- It's a family!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>It's in your head!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>No, Kim! There's a train, a real train!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>No!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Kim! Move! It's in your head!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Kim! No!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Elliot, what happened?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Kim, she's dead.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Shit. Jesus.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Oh, my God.
- It was him. He killed her.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You were right,
he's trying to get inside us.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>He got in her. He's going to
drive us crazy and he's going to kill us.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- You mean the...
- Yeah.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>He's why I was late to get you.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>He's why you're feeling sick.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Have you said the name to anyone?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>The name... No. No.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Have you?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>No, I haven't said...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Good. Don't. We can't say
the name to anyone else, ever.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You going to tell me what to do now?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Swear you won't say the name
so we don't spread it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- No...
- John, please.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Please.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Bro, swear it.
- You just need to cut this shit.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You swear!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Swear!
- No.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Swear!
- Elliot, stop it!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Swear!
- What's wrong with you, Elliot?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- What's wrong with you?
- Elliot, stop it!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Hey, guys!
- Hey, break it up!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I said break it up right now!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Back up.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- He got to you, didn't he?
- No one got to me, all right?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Admit it. He's making you feel angry.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- He's making you sick.
- Yeah?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>He's making you crazy.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You on something?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>No, I'm upset.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>We're just having a little argument.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You call that a "little argument"?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>John, please.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Please don't say it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Don't say what?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Sasha?
- I won't.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>J, you can't.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>This name of some stupid shit
Elliot thinks is dangerous.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Yes. I was talking about Kim.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>There was a hammer in her bag.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>It was covered with blood.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Oh, my God.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Train's engineer said
that you were chasing Kim,</font>
<font color=#0000FF>with the hammer.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>He said she was crying for help,</font>
<font color=#0000FF>and that she jumped out of your car
to get away from you.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Jesus Christ. Elliot?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>That's not what happened.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>No? They found Kim's roommate,
Katie Williams.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>She was killed by a hammer, too, but...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You knew that, didn't you?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I... Sasha, no! I was at the library.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>He made me lose track of time. You have...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Sasha?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Do you want to talk to me here?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You want to tell me what's going on?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Don't say it. Don't
think it. You were right!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Quiet.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Sasha, what doesn't he want you to say?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Yeah, Sash.
- You! Shut it!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>It just happened, John.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You see that? It's him.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>No.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Sasha.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What? What is it?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Blood.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Blood?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Where?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What do you see? He makes you see things.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Fuck.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Oh, my God.
- Hey! Hey! Hey!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Back away. I need you over here.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>She's fine. Stay back.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Wait, there he is!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Hey!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Hey, bud. Somethin' wrong?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- I'm sorry. I thought...
- What?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Hey, are you all right?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Wait! Wait! Sasha!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>He's gonna take her home
and she's going to lie down for a bit.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I'm her boyfriend. She needs me.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Maybe. Maybe later.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>But right now,
you're going to come with me.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>We're going to talk a little bit.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Did you say the name to anyone?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>She didn't, man.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Neither of us did.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>It's gonna be all right.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Don't say it. Don't think it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Don't say it. Don't think it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Don't think it. Don't think it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Good news for you. Maybe.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Kim Hines wrote a suicide note,</font>
<font color=#0000FF>taking responsibility for her roommate</font>
<font color=#0000FF>and for the deaths of you
and the other two living at your house.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>So, I guess she was
planning on killing you, too.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Is that what happened, Elliot?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You found out and you chased her?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I don't think that's murder.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Don't think it. Don't say it. Don't think it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You want to write it?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>No.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You're going to tell me, you know that.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I hope not.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Why did you chase Kim?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I told you, I was trying to help her.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>So you chased her into a train?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What are you doing?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You could lose everything.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Your scholarship, that pretty girl.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You are a smart kid.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Talk to me and I can help you.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Otherwise, it'll be out of my hands</font>
<font color=#0000FF>and you'll be wishing that you had.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You might find yourself wishing I hadn't.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Well, you let me worry about that.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You really want to know?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You really think the truth,
honesty, is the best policy?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- I do.
- Always?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>When wouldn't it be?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You have kids?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Maybe.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You have kids.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Don't think it. Don't say it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What if you saw
the worst crime scene ever?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>A mass murder at a school.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>With dead bodies and brains and students</font>
<font color=#0000FF>and sneakers with blood on them.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>And you go home, and your kids say,</font>
<font color=#0000FF>"Tell us about your day, Mommy."</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You could be honest.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You could tell the truth.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You could describe every
awful nightmare thing you saw,</font>
<font color=#0000FF>and what was burned into your head</font>
<font color=#0000FF>would be burned into their heads forever.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Or...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You could hug them tight,</font>
<font color=#0000FF>and spare them your honest truth.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What would you do?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I'd hug them.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Please don't make me say it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I haven't hurt anyone.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>But I'm afraid of
putting this into your head.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>All I have to do is talk to you,
and you and your kids...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You're all dead.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Hey! Elliot!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Your friend died?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What the hell is going on, man?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Thanks for coming to
get me, but I gotta go.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Was it Sasha and John...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Hey, talk to me. Let me help you.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Whatever is going on,
there's nothing you can do, okay?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I literally can't tell you.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I'm not going to let it
happen to you, Virgil.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Especially not you.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What are you talking about?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You've got a family. Go take care of them.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Elliot, hey! You are my family. Elliot!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Shit!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Fuck!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Yeah!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Oh, my God.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What are you doing, Elliot?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What's... What's wrong with you, Elliot?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What the...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I'm so sorry.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Elliot?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Hi, Ms. Watkins.
- Hi. Elliot?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I've been having
some really strange thoughts</font>
<font color=#0000FF>about that Bye Bye Man since we talked.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Ms. Watkins...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Ms. Watkins, you can't
talk to anyone about it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Well, maybe I can
come over to your house later.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I'm so sorry.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I'm sorry, too.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Believe me, but I've just been
having the most vivid thoughts. I...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Elliot?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Elliot?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Redmon...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Larry Redmon.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>The writer.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>It was his nightstand.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Ms. Watkins.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Okay, maybe I'll see you later,
maybe I'll have a fix for this.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- I gotta go. Thanks.
- Oh, you're welcome...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I'll be there soon.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>He almost got us, man.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Oh, fuck! I almost killed you with a bat,
but, fuck, he's not going to get us.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>He's not going to get us.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I'll figure this out.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I'm really sorry, but...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I'm sorry, I can't call an ambulance,
'cause you're gonna say it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You will. You will.
'Cause I messed you up.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I'll be back as soon as I can.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I'm taking this.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You found her and now
I'm going to go talk to her.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I love you.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>And don't touch him.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Bye-bye, happiness</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Hello, loneliness</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I think I'm gonna cry</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Bye-bye, love</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Bye-bye, sweet caress</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Hello, emptiness</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I feel like I'm gonna die</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Bye-bye, my love, goodbye</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Hello?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Mrs. Redmon?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Leave.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Ms. Redmon?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I said, leave! Are you deaf,
or just defective?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Ms. Redmon, did your husband write
for The Register a long time ago?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You're too young to remember that.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Ms. Redmon. You're still alive.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I know your husband
killed a lot of people.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>But I don't think he was crazy.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I need your help, whatever you remember.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>There's a train, gold coins...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>A hound...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>He came to Larry.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>With the hound.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What Larry told me gave me nightmares.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I made him stop.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I understand.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>But I need you to tell me
everything Larry said.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Please.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Larry was on a story of a teenager
who killed his family.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Poked around like a good nosy
reporter and heard rumors...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Whispers about an evil,</font>
<font color=#0000FF>some kind of a reaper
that drove the teenager mad.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Larry had to go nosing around
and writing it down.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>And then it came to Larry, too,</font>
<font color=#0000FF>this nightmare, this name
we must not think or say.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>But just three days
after Larry got back from Iowa,</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I came home from work.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>October 20th, 1969.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>The day my life went turn-turn-turn...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Don't say it. Don't think it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Don't say it.
Don't think it. Don't say it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Don't think it.
Don't say it. Don't think it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Don't say it. Don't think it.
Don't say it. Don't think it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Don't say it. Don't think it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Oh, my God.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Don't say it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Larry... Oh, my God.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I was just doing my job.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>That's what I do. I track down the story.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>And that's what I was doing.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>See...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Once you know his name,
you can't escape him.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You see, he gets in your head and...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>He makes you do horrible things.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Okay. Okay.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What horrible things?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Who makes you do this?
What are you talking about?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Let's get you to bed, okay, sweetheart?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Listen. Listen, I didn't know
if he was alive or dead.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>And then the hound...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>That's how you know he's coming.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>When you see the hound
and you hear the coins,</font>
<font color=#0000FF>that's when you know he's close by.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- You understand?
- No, I...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Larry...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I don't know what's happened,
but I'm trying...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>He listens for his name.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Anyone could say it. It could be you.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Or it could be me.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>And it's just dumb luck
like the flip of a coin.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>And I heard the name
and I told Janey the name.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>"Don't think it. Don't say it."</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What does this mean? What did you write?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I don't understand.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>He makes you see things.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>And he makes you do things.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Who knows how many good people
he's made do horrible things like this.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>No! Oh, God, no! Please.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Please, don't.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Please put it down.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You think it's me?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You think I did this?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>This is what happens.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>They say people snap.
They say people go crazy.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>No, it's him.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>It's him that's doing it!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Just put it... Put it down. Okay?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>No.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I love you.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>But in the end, Larry was a hero.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You tell people that.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Larry erased him, you see.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>He did away with everyone who'd
heard it before they could pass it on.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>But not you.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You're here.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>How did you survive all this time?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Survive?
- Yes.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>How did you beat it?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I didn't beat it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I never knew it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>If my husband had told me the name,
he'd have had to kill me with the rest.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>My husband controlled himself.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Your fucking husband wrote the name
in the nightstand you sold and I read it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>He typed it in a dead article
and I read that, too!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Don't you say it!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Your husband spared you and he got me.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>He's in me now. He's in my friends.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- You want my help?
- Yes.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Here.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Kill all of the ones you told first
and then kill yourself.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>It's the only way.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>No! There has to be another way.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>"Don't say it.
Don't think it." It's a clue.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Look.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Oh, my God. He's coming!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What are you talking about?
You didn't bring him here.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Don't you see it?
- See what?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>The light... Hear the name...
He's in your head.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>He makes us see things, hear things,
tricks to make us afraid.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>He makes us afraid. Then he grows.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>The more scared we are,
the more real he gets.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>We make him real with our fear.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>We make him more powerful.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Yeah, we give him the power</font>
<font color=#0000FF>and he gets closer and he hears us
when we think of him.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>But maybe, if we're not afraid,
we take his power.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Maybe, if we're not afraid, he's nothing!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>How could you figure it out
and my Larry not?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Help me!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Shoot me!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Shoot me now!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>No, no! It's not real!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>No, it's not real.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Help me!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I have you now, don't I?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Come on, try another trick.
Come on, try it!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Where are you?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Where are you?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Oh, my God.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Sasha!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Pick up.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Sasha?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Hey. It's Sasha. Leave a message...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You better not fuckin' hurt her!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Thanks.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Sasha. I'm coming.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I know it's hard, but don't be afraid.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>And don't believe anything you see.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Whoa, what the...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>No, you're not real.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Not real!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Ha! I knew it!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Okay. Tricks.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You want to play tricks?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Okay. I'm ready.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Elliot!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>John!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Where are you guys?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Elliot?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Sasha!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Elliot!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Sasha?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I'm in here.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Oh, God.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You look like hell.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Jesus.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>There you are.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Elliot... Thank God. You're back.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I'm not...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Oh, my God.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Hey, what's the matter?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Elliot, what are you doing?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Shit.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Get away.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Hey, come on, it's all going to be okay.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>We're going to be okay. I feel better.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Get away!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Elliot! It's me!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What the hell?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Elliot, I don't understand.
What are you doing?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Help!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Elliot! Come on.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Come here, John.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Please, Elliot!
- Help!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I don't understand. Please.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>No.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Come on.
- No!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Please.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Stop. Elliot, please stop!
Will you just stop?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Get away from me!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Get away!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Guys!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Sasha, John, it's a trick. It's not real.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Listen to me!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Sasha, John. Listen to me, it's not real.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>John, no!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Elliot! Shoot! Shoot!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>No!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Go ahead. Kill me.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You win.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>No.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>You leave them alone!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Come on, guys. It's freezing out here.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Hey, man. Anybody home?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I've got Alice here.
She's here to cheer you up, buddy.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Elliot!
- No!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Hey! Anybody home?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Guys, come on! We know you're in there.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I hear something. Hello!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Open the door, you guys.
We're turning into popsicles out here.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Go away!
- Elliot?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Go away!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>No, no. We're not going anywhere, Elliot.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Uncle, open up!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Please, get her out of here.
Both of you, you need to go!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Elliot, open the goddamn door
or I'm calling the police.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Good. Do it!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Honey, why don't you go wait in the truck?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>No! Daddy, I got to pee!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Go to the truck, please.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Open the door, man, come on.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Go. Go.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>- Elliot!

<font color=#0000FF>The Bye Bye Man. Bye Bye...</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Bye Bye? What is that? Bye Bye?</font>

<font color=#0000FF>Alice?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Alice?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Where are you, baby?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Alice!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Alice? Alice?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Honey?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Alice?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Alice?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Alice!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Honey! Come here!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I was cold!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Oh, I know, honey,
but you scared me so much!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Oh, no! Look!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Uncle Elliot!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>It's okay.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>It's okay.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>The fire can't hurt him anymore.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>So, this boy ran a librarian over,</font>
<font color=#0000FF>mutilated and murdered her children,</font>
<font color=#0000FF>and then killed his roommates and himself</font>
<font color=#0000FF>and you had him in custody today,
but you let him go?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Yes. But this is not some creepy kid
pulling a Columbine, okay?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I talked to him.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Something is going on here. I can feel it.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I wanted to say goodbye.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>I know, baby. Me, too.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>At least he gave me the coins.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What are you talking about?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>He must've left them
out there for me to find.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Left them out where, honey?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>In the little table.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Outside, next to the trash cans.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Well, was there
anything else in this table?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>No.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Just some writing.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Writing?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What did this writing say?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Daddy. You know I can't read in the dark.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>What do you think I am? A flashlight?</font>
<font color=#0000FF>We got one alive!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Get me a tool, a line and morphine!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Wait, wait! He's trying to say something!</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Hey, I'm listening, go ahead.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>It won't matter.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>It does matter.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Okay, take your time.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>It's okay. I'm here.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>And I want to know.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Please. Please tell me.</font>
<font color=#0000FF>Bye Bye Man...</font>
