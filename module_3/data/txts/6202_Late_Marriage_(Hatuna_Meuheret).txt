LATE MARRIAGE
Rinse me off first!
I know what I'm doing.
Why so gently?
Put some muscle into it!
My shoulder hurts enough already.
Stop moaning
and jump in here with me!
I have news for you, Tarzan.
I'm no Jane!
I told you: the head first.
Why won't you rinse me off?
Is big baby crying?
Does he have soap in his eyes?
Let the water run from above!
Not like that.
Above my head, I said!
Will you just let me
get the soap out?
Give me that!
Shit, shit, shit!
You like to see me suffer,
don't you?
Coming!
Why did you drag me here?
You should have
asked for the address.
We're here.
Let's say hello at least.
I'm sick and tired of doing this.
I told you, let me be.
I do fine on my own.
Admit that your life's a mess.
I run my life as I want to.
Heard his tone?
How did you get so fat?
It's easy...
She eats right out of the pots.
- Shalom.
- Peace be with you, my boy.
Still covered in soap!
Sorry to disappoint you,
but it won't kill me.
How are you?
Frisky as ever?
With what she puts me through!
You're in good hands.
What does that jackass want?
You can have her!
She's ruining my life!
He just misses those sluts
from his past.
Who are these people
you're introducing to us?
You'll never meet a finer family.
They say you can't find
a better girl than her.
Who recommended this girl?
"Recommended"...
"They say"...?
Do you expect them to say
she's a cripple?
Why didn't you
check her out first?
Listen, son,
your mother asked me
to find you a nice girl.
Everyone raves about this girl.
A girl with manners
who helps her mother at home.
She hardly ever leaves the house.
What more do you want?
That I should follow her?
Would seeing her
make any difference?
In any case, it's your decision.
That's exactly why he's
still without full-time pussy!
There he goes again
with that filthy talk.
What else do you know?
How old is she?
She's an angel.
Still in high school.
These people have no money.
The father is dead.
So all she has is her ass?
Not a penny?
What good is she?
- That's what you waited for?
- Let's go, get it over.
Sit down.
Sabbath isn't over.
Lili, come here a minute.
Take this.
You must see the girl before Zaza.
If you like her,
slip this under her bed.
You paid for that?
I don't believe in love charms.
A famous Egyptian rabbi made this
especially for Zaza.
The foreskin of
an 8-day-old baby boy.
This is responsible
for all the marriages in Haifa.
That might be,
but not on my son.
His fortune will change
on its own.
This is no time to play around.
You might be right,
but this rabbi's blessing
can't be rejected.
The mother must carry it
against her skin.
What do I do?
Go and see the girl first.
If you like her,
put that under her bed.
How will I know?
They're all actresses.
If she's convincing, take her.
At least it means she's clever.
I'll die of shame if they find it!
Relax,
no one will ever know it was you.
Four like you a day
in that house!
What are you two plotting?
Where are my clothes?
Hands off my backside.
If you want to play with someone's
butt, your wife is there for that.
Keep your advice to yourself.
Get out of here.
Let us get dressed!
Where do you think you're going?
You're not coming with us.
Woman, my clothes here, now!
Then take care of your guests!
What a disgrace!
Look at how you're dressed!
Are you out of your mind?
Do you have any idea
what you look like?
What should I have worn?
Sequins like Elvis?
It's so obvious
that you're here against your will.
What does he want from me?
A yellow shirt. No tie...
And that bulging pocket!
What's in there?
Where should I put them?
Give them to me.
The girl's uncle is here.
He's praying.
Lili,
let's go up first.
That way, you'll see the girl.
You wait here.
No way. It's not right.
Relax, they won't
show the girl right away.
Where will we say he is?
We'll say he wants his parents
to see the girl first.
Go on up,
and see if she's worth it.
Mom!
- What?
- The keys.
Don't be angry if
I don't want her.
We'll show you a hundred more
if that's what it takes.
Good luck, suckers!
Come on, son.
Let's take a look at you.
This is Zaza.
Magouly, my sister.
She's Ilana's mother.
Dita, Ilana's grandmother.
Lali, my wife.
Benny, come and tell Zaza hello.
Shut that off
and listen to your elders.
There'll be other movies.
Movies are the last thing you need.
What a big boy...
Ready for a wife, too.
He still has time.
Every thing in its own sweet time.
What do you say, son?
Do you want a wife?
Do you have a girlfriend?
- Excuse me, it was a long trip.
- Sure, it's over there.
First door on the left.
I'm Lili, the boy's mother.
A pleasure. I'm Ilana.
Can you put the light on
in the bathroom?
Of course.
How cute you are!
What's your name?
Don't be shy.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
Zaza,
You know what they lack?
Respect.
They live like husband and wife.
A marriage without a wedding.
When one has enough...
Then what?
Where's the commitment
and respect?
Not an ounce of dignity.
Married or not,
here, they have something else.
They call it love.
But where is the temple of love?
Here!
Somewhere between the head
and down there.
Excuse me, I'm speaking to you
like family.
For us, the mind prevails.
The heart can become so light
that it rises higher,
toward the head.
It's the head
which rules the body.
Too much importance
is given to the heart and love.
To the point where the heart
becomes heavy and sinks.
What's everlasting love?
The couple splits without it.
The slightest problem
and they divorce.
- How old are you?
- 31.
What do you do?
I'm studying.
A boy your age is
still in school?
University.
He's finishing his doctorate.
A doctor!
Who could hope for more!
You're going to be a doctor?
I'm studying the Humanities.
An intellectual!
That can be useful, too.
I'm sorry for not
serving anything.
I know. For such occasions,
not even water is offered.
We respect traditions.
If there are no more questions,
go and get the girl.
Come on, honey.
You, too.
They might come in here.
This is... Zaza.
Nice to meet you.
I told you she was a knockout.
Yasha, Zaza's father.
We've already met.
Now it's your turn.
Where would you like to go?
You two can go out for a drink
or speak in the room.
Wait!
They might have some questions.
Excuse me, dear Yasha.
How old are you?
I'm 17.
Sounds good! And anyone can see
she's not pregnant.
If Zaza agrees, I'll take her.
OK, so...
where would you like to chat?
Wherever.
I know.
But you still have to choose.
In your room?
OK.
You'd better shut the door.
Thanks.
What's with that look?
- What look?
- Chutzpah!
And that?
- What?
-That.
This?
- A dress or a nightgown?
- What do you think?
Whatever, it's nice.
These are great.
Impressive.
Enough. I think you got it.
Is that your hobby?
I want to be a designer.
You did those?
What do you do?
I ask myself if God exists.
I'm working on my doctorate
in philosophy.
And the answer?
If suddenly...
a monster came out of the ocean
and said...
"I am God"...
would you believe it?
It depends on how
much he paid me.
Everybody has his own God.
Objective proof is hard to find.
Who's your God?
If that monster was able
to convince my mother
that love exists,
I'd believe in him.
You're on the wrong track,
waiting for that miracle.
Life is tough.
What kind of
woman do you want?
A woman so perfect for me
that I'd go insane.
Can you be a little
more specific?
More specific?
She has to be beautiful.
And understand me.
I want a rich man.
Should we go back?
No, not yet.
Come and help me!
Excuse me.
Where did you hide the corkscrew?
Excuse me, Mr. Yasha.
You surely know our custom.
There's nothing
to fear between friends.
In that case, find it yourself.
Do you have kids?
That's the oldest, Miri...
She's old enough for marriage.
And below...
the two youngest.
God bless them!
If you know a nice boy,
send him over.
I know I'm her uncle,
but I just can't
help saying it.
Ilana is a good girl.
She'll be completely devoted
to her man.
You don't have to tell me.
Her qualities can't be missed.
Go ahead and serve me.
I already have a wife.
That wine doesn't bring us
bad luck!
Whether I drink or not,
bad luck or not,
I like her.
My Zaza has it all!
A five-room apartment,
a big screen TV,
a brand new refrigerator,
a Sony CD player,
a bedroom, a living room,
a brand new Lancia.
What more could one ask for?
A doctor of Tel Aviv University.
A really smart boy!
So why isn't he married yet?
Fate!
I don't expect anything.
Give her to me as she is.
I'll take her
in that dress alone.
In that case, dear Yasha,
we needn't say more.
We're not shady dealers.
To changing Zaza's fate!
Cheers!
Have you seen a lot of girls?
They introduced me
to about a hundred.
Have you been engaged?
No.
You didn't like any of them?
The ones I liked didn't like me.
What do you think of me?
You're different.
I wouldn't say no.
You're really here for marriage?
I hope to get something
out of it.
The door is closed.
I'm not joking around.
Neither me.
Ilana, you're too much for me.
Tell me something I don't know.
Have you ever kept
your mouth shut?
Never.
- Ilana!
- What?
- Ilana!
-Zaza!
- Shut up!
- But I like talking to you.
If not for the spy under the bed,
I could have told you
a great bedtime story.
Noya, get out of here.
I don't want to.
And what do you think of me?
I'll tell you some other time.
- Another time?
- Maybe.
So what's the verdict?
You really want an answer now?
Isn't it for the best?
Tell us what you think.
There's no rush.
They have time.
We'll ask her what she thinks.
We'll ask around about the boy.
They don't ask about her.
Such a nice girl!
If only all my grandsons...
married one like her!
They can search all of Israel,
and they won't find one like her.
I have nothing to ask.
He's right here.
If he agrees, so do I.
Speak up, if you like him!
You're making her nervous.
Don't rush things.
That could ruin everything.
God forbid!
For the last time,
speak your mind.
In that case, dear Yasha,
I'll call you.
You'll have
a response in 2 days.
Dear Bessik, don't forget.
I'm counting on you.
My word is gold.
Dear God, how could you create
so many fools?
Hurry, I need to pee.
So you open it.
I forgot my bag in the car.
Great! Make me run again!
Yasha!
Give me a suitcase of money
or I'll hit you!
Hit first
and you'll have it afterwards.
Don't trick me!
I'll hit you, then have nothing!
Forget it, then.
Schmuck!
Give me a suitcase of money
or I'll hit you!
Save it.
Lili!
Come down. He's gone.
Where's your Mommy?
In the bathtub.
Are you coming, Dooby?
Tell your Mommy that Haim called.
But you're Dooby!
Madonna, who was that?
Dooby.
Who's Dooby? Which Dooby?
"I spoke to Dooby."
"He said his name was Haim."
"I love him."
- Who is it?
- Dooby.
I know it's you, Dooby.
- Did you tell her it was you?
- No.
- It's too early.
- Too bad.
She's not asleep yet.
So what? I'm coming over.
- This is Haim. Give me your Mommy.
- You're Dooby!
No, Haim.
I'm sorry.
When does she go to bed?
I don't know.
Call back in an hour.
Who is it?
Margalit, open up!
It's me, Lili.
What's wrong?
Everything alright?
I forgot our keys in Zaza's car.
Well, at least it made you
finally visit us.
Welcome!
Zaza dropped us off
and God knows where he is.
Does it matter?
You're not out on the street.
They saw Abraham's niece
in Kiryat Yam.
Did you close the deal?
Nothing is gained by rushing.
It's a disgrace to
the whole family
that this boy
still isn't married at 31.
I don't know what else to do.
I've tried everything.
In or out?
Hello to you, too.
Why can't I see her?
You can see her
when your parents see me.
And what a piece of work
they'll see then!
You're waiting for me
to be an old woman?
They can't stand divorced women.
So come back once you've been
married, had two kids and divorced.
Be patient. It'll work out.
Let me finish my doctorate.
Stop it. You'll wake her.
It's too hard.
You need a hammer.
Try with a shoe.
Are you crazy? Quiet!
Do you have a screwdriver?
We'll put that thing to good use.
Be careful.
This meant so much
that he left it for you?
So I wouldn't forget him.
Who could forget with this thing
over one's head?
Who said I forgot him?
Maybe because you're with me.
Cossack!
My dear Yasha, God bless you!
You've brought so
much good around you.
You don't deserve to suffer.
It's true.
There's not a more honest man.
Lili, call him!
Maybe he's back.
What's your hurry?
Who has to wake at 4,
you or me?
I don't want him to fall asleep.
If he's back, tell him to come over.
I have a couple words for him.
To missing friends.
To those who beat us to the grave.
To those we left behind
and who rest in
the land of Georgia.
I'm close and you?
Pull out in time. I already came.
When?
A while ago. It just happened.
I couldn't hold back. Pull out.
You didn't come.
It burns, Dooby.
I think I got an infection.
My uterus can't
stand your sperm.
My sperm?
Come on, you know what I mean!
Pull out just before.
I'm coming!
What did you do?
Congratulations!
Sorry. I couldn't help it.
Yeah, yeah...
You didn't come.
You're still hard.
Bastard!
Stop, I need a break. Wait!
- Tell me!
- What?
What's witchcraft?
You mean witchcraft or magic?
Witchcraft.
I know what magic is.
The distant influence
of one being onto another.
Run that by me again.
Witchcraft is the belief
that two independent bodies...
two bodies without
physical contact...
can influence one another.
Does that really exist?
Stand up.
Can't I hear you lying down?
Are you interested or not?
I hear you fine like this.
Stand up.
Get on all fours!
What?
On your knees!
Enough! No standing,
no kneeling, no more games.
Keep your theories to yourself.
OK, I just won't tell you.
So tell me!
Look at your breasts.
What do you see?
I see my breasts.
Get up.
Look at your breasts!
What do you see?
I see my breasts.
Lean over a little.
What do you see?
Well, I see your dick.
Your breasts are attracted down.
Next time,
use your balls as an example.
If you get off on my balls
the way I do on your breasts,
then I'm willing to try.
So what's the point of
this ridiculous game?
To show that your breasts
are always attracted to the ground.
It has nothing to
do with witchcraft.
We've explained
the force exerted by the earth.
This phenomenon
is called gravity.
Gravity is responsible
for the attraction of all objects.
Among them,
your breasts.
Science, like witchcraft,
is based on assumptions
and beliefs.
So I can believe
that witchcraft exists?
Beliefs are just
as worthy as science.
Yes, my beautiful believer!
- So you'll pull out?
- Of course.
You know?
- You know?
- Tell me.
I'm yours alone.
Only yours.
You know it.
I'm almost there.
Pull out before.
You didn't come.
It doesn't matter.
It was great.
Get some tissue.
Hold on.
It's dripping. Get some tissue.
Is that all?
Yes, my hot stud.
What are you doing?
I have to sleep standing.
A wife from a previous life
is haunting me.
Stop scaring me
with your ghosts.
OK.
If it doesn't bother you that
she sleeps between us...
I'll come to bed.
Good night.
I don't want you sleeping here
with your ghost.
Madonna gets up early.
I'm tired.
When does she get up?
I wake her at 7.
I'll be gone by 6. Good night.
Who'll wake you?
I've got a precise
internal alarm.
It wakes me 15 minutes
before the time I set.
Good night.
Dooby...
So that's it?
You get off and go to sleep
without even a kiss?
Dooby...
Stop that shit!
I heard. I'm up.
What are you doing up so early?
I can only sleep in my own bed.
You couldn't sleep because
you were phoning all night.
It's dawn and he's not home.
Maybe something happened to him.
He's chasing some bitch.
He must be at her place.
He'll never marry
if he's not hungry for sex.
He promised
that he would end it.
And you believed him?
He swore on his mother's life!
So what? Women have ruined
whole empires!
I don't know what to do
with him anymore.
Take drastic measures.
Like those used on you.
The change was radical.
You never set foot
in that Margot's house again.
But I was never caught naked.
You had to crawl
under the bed.
What?
Where are they?
Put them on!
Hurry and get dressed!
What?
Stop playing deaf and dumb!
I don't want her to see you.
Internal clock, my ass!
Great!
Go on!
That's my toothbrush.
You've lost the right
to brush your teeth here.
Out!
What are you up to?
Go get married!
Stop hanging around here.
You'll lose less underwear.
Wake up, honey.
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes.
- Where's Dooby?
- Which Dooby?
- Dooby, your boyfriend.
- You were dreaming.
You must have
been dreaming, honey.
No one's here.
I saw him. He slept here.
Really? So where is he?
Where is he?
Go on, get up.
Hurry or you'll be late.
- I know you love him.
- Really?
Who told you that, honey?
Who told you that?
Was it your father?
- Dooby told me. - Last night?
- It was him on the phone.
He said you don't
want me to see him.
I'm sorry, honey.
You will see him.
You'll see him dead!
Now, go and get dressed.
Your clothes are waiting.
Where were you?
Out all night buying bread?
Lost your tongue
along the way?
You woke up at
dawn to get bread
without even
brushing your teeth?
It's me you're talking to.
I've been through it myself.
Give me the keys.
I want to go home already.
Give me the keys!
Can't you leave that bitch?
I don't have time now.
But you'll hear from me later.
Makes one wonder
who's screwing who?
You're just screwing yourself.
Mouki!
Time for a walk?
Horny bastard!
What do you want?
Be careful of bitches in heat.
Put away your diary.
You'll be late for school.
"Last night,
Dooby slept with Mommy."
- Do you have your key?
- It's there.
Show it to me!
May I really see Dooby?
If he's still alive.
May your heart burn!
Burn only for me!
Burn like this handkerchief!
I need to pee.
Are you sure it's here?
She lives there.
Second floor.
Where exactly?
Second floor,
the balcony with no plants.
Look. That must be her.
- How do you know?
- We've waited 2 hours.
That's the first beautiful woman
that passes by.
That's her. That's her!
Look at her.
The way that slut
wiggles her ass!
If Margalit had an ass like that,
- I'd be the world's happiest man.
- It's a shame she's not younger.
If she didn't have the kid,
you'd still be against her?
She could be made of gold!
No divorcee under my roof!
Poor Zaza!
Who could make him forget
such a beautiful woman?
What a waste!
Giving up such a woman.
Are you here
to mess everything up?
Not at all.
We don't have any choice.
We have to take a stand.
It's her or us.
If we don't stop this now,
she'll keep poisoning his heart.
It's the only way to snatch Zaza
from her claws.
We'll march up to her apartment
and do our number on her.
She has a little girl.
She'll be scared shitless.
Did you see how hot she is?
Her ex-husband must have
ears like this.
Only an ass could divorce her.
Zaza isn't in the same boat
as we were.
He doesn't have a wife at home.
Or brothers-in-law
threatening him with knives.
If he refuses to give her up,
we'll lose him. She'll have him.
She has to give him up.
She'll regret
the day she was born.
I'll strangle her
with my own hands.
I'll beat her
until she begs me
to take back Zaza.
Let's go!
We don't want him
to find us here.
There are tall
bushes back there.
I can hold it in.
Where's Zaza?
I haven't cooked.
So go call your husband.
There he is!
Who is it?
Dress up. I'm here with my parents
to ask you to marry me.
#What about your doctorate?
They think it's a shame to wait.
Don't start. I'm stupid enough
to have waited so long.
That was your choice.
Should we go up?
Let's wait a while.
We'll surprise them in action.
Mouki tracked me.
Zaza saw us,
but he went up anyway.
So what if he knows we're here?
I've got some business
to take care of with that tramp.
Did you see that?
Look at what he's bringing her!
Simon never comes
home so loaded.
Don't worry.
She won't be getting
it for much longer.
He's coming!
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.
- Did you eat today?
- Yes.
That's weird.
I didn't hear the buzzer.
Good evening.
Real classy! Is that all
you could find to screw?
A whore with a kid!
That takes real balls!
So that's where my money goes!
Sit down.
Ansor, get me a chair.
That's the oven
that we gave to Zaza!
Simon, he gave her our oven!
It was ours and Zaza took it.
So that's why it was so urgent.
We lived with no oven for 2 days!
I hope you're satisfied!
You're a beautiful woman.
How old are you?
34.
I'm 56. My wife...
is 51.
He keeps the bitch's
fridge full.
What a stench!
My sister is 47.
Her husband is 55.
My wife's brother is 53.
He's wife 46.
- 45...
- 45.
Zaza's grandmother...
His grandfather
was 8 years older than his wife.
I had that oven for 7 years.
I never saw it so dirty.
My daughter Maya is 28.
Her husband is 32.
That's how we do things.
Man older, woman younger.
Zaza is 31. You're 34.
It's no good,
a woman older than her husband.
A big woman with a little man?
- The credit card.
- Let me finish.
I want it right now.
Don't give me that look!
Put your father's credit card
on the table!
How dare you support her
with my sweat!
Let me speak to them.
Come, Lili.
Do you think it's right for a grown
woman to be with a little boy?
What do you want from him, anyway?
I ask you kindly.
Zaza is my oldest.
With all the men in the world.
Let this one go.
I want Zaza to marry
the right woman.
But I love Dooby.
Other men don't interest me.
See where your money goes!
He bites the hand
that feeds him!
Keep her away from me.
Come on, Lili. Take it easy.
Why throw away your life?
What do you expect from her?
Let her go about her way.
Where's your father,
little girl?
At Rachel's.
He takes me on Wednesday.
She'll end up laying
one like that for Zaza.
You choose her over us?
They even took trips together!
You want a bride for him,
but he's already settled down.
What do you want from me?
I know what I'm doing.
I know what you're doing, too.
You're living this whore.
Why a whore?
For opening her door and heart?
Shitty bastard!
A real man doesn't break
his mother's heart like this.
I'll carry you out dead,
if I have to!
But I'll separate
you from that woman!
All the cocks in the world,
but not Zaza's!
I'm not afraid. You're not
the first to wave that thing.
The bitch doesn't care.
She wants me to kill her.
Here.
Go on! Cut off my head!
Go on, do it for me!
Go on, do it so I'll be rid of her!
Get up! We're not
here to kill you.
Stand up instead of showing us
your ass like a fag!
You know that girl's
not for you.
Why torture your parents?
Out, all of you!
I want them apart. Or I'm not moving.
Sorry, we're over.
Get out!
He goes first!
There's nothing left
for you here. Out!
Come on.
You know your mother.
We're all done here.
Let's go.
He'll never be yours.
I warn you to drop him.
They'll never give up.
Why didn't you let me know?
I didn't know myself.
You made a fool of me!
You knew.
And you told me to dress up.
I couldn't know.
They waited hours on the parking
lot for you to get back.
Mommy, I don't know
what to write.
I'll help you.
Write today's date.
"Mommy
"chased away the monster
"who wanted to take Dooby."
Come on, let's play.
Come on, I'll do it
with only one hand.
They are worse than my ex-husband.
I don't want to see you anymore.
I'm sorry she had to see that.
I know.
Go on,
before Mommy sends the cops.
Now you can't see.
You're blind.
Believe me,
you'll thank me one day.
As long as you're happy.
You should've cut my head off.
What's wrong with you?
What do you want with
another man's kid and a divorcee?
Your woman is better
having only raised your children?
You're a disgrace!
Let him be.
I thought you were a man!
Don't hurt yourself.
He'll bury the both of us.
You're as worthless
as a dead dog!
I'll kill her first.
She'll never be your wife.
I'll let no one
take advantage of my son.
Go on, home.
You knew it couldn't last.
How could you
get involved with her?
What were you thinking?
You broke your own heart.
This is the only way.
Better to suffer now.
Instead of when
you're tired of screwing her.
She's not the woman for you.
We don't do things
that way here.
Look at your friends.
None of them act like you.
A respectable woman doesn't take
a younger man.
Stop hurting us.
048 751 022.
Her name is Lea.
Her father is a goldsmith.
She works with him.
She's 23.
Naziko says she's pretty.
She hasn't married yet
because she's been studying.
She wants to see you first,
before her parents get involved.
I promised her
mother you'd call.
You might like her.
Don't let yourself forget.
I promised her
mother you'd call.
Don't shame me.
There she is.
Be nice.
We haven't come to fight.
Don't be afraid.
She's come to make peace.
This is for you.
She's Dooby's mother.
She brought you a present.
Say thank you.
Thank you.
How's Zaza?
Let's go up.
Can we speak in front of her?
Madonna, go do your homework.
Do you see Zaza?
No.
Zaza and I broke up.
I don't speak to him anymore.
Please tell me the truth.
Your son is stubborn.
He wants us to get back
together and get married.
Even if I believed him,
I wouldn't go back to him.
Your husband is right.
I'm not the woman for him.
He needs a young woman.
Start his own family.
At first,
I thought he'd be able
to give all that up.
But seeing the way he acted
that night you came over...
I realized that he loves you
more than me.
Going back to him is no good.
Not for him, not for me.
You're a good woman.
Thank you.
A very good woman.
You chicken!
You're just a coward.
What did she say?
Did you leave Margot because
my father threatened to kill you?
Since when do
you call her Margot?
She's always been "my whore".
Answer me!
For the same reason
you took me back.
I didn't want
to be a divorcee.
She got to your heart, too?
Going there
did me more harm than good.
What did she say?
That Zaza begs her
to take him back.
Do you want her?
Let's see if he gets over it.
That's a nice dick you have, Dad.
Dad,
How I love your balls!
Next year,
I want a grandson.
You've put us through enough.
Don't keep us waiting.
You're crazy!
Someone could come in.
That's where I come from.
You made me with those.
You should be proud.
Don't go and thank your mother
the way you just thanked me.
Good luck, suckers!
Quiet!
I said shut up already!
Where's my wife?
Where are you?
Wife!
Come here, wife!
Play something light!
What's that noise?
I said something light.
Play something bittersweet.
Play something so sad
that it sounds sweet.
Come here, stand next to me.
What's come over you?
Don't go too far.
She's already telling
me what to do.
Where are you going?
Don't go anywhere.
Stay with me.
If anyone in this room thinks
that he has a woman
more beautiful than mine,
let him come up here
and we'll compare.
Anyone?
Then I have the world's
most beautiful wife.
The most beautiful
feather on my cap.
What's with the silence?
Is this a funeral?
Play, play, I tell you!
You guys didn't get it.
To compete in this contest,
you have to bring a wife.
Go away and don't come back
without wives.
Just give me two minutes.
So, where are you men
with your perfect wives?
So?
Are you afraid to disappoint the
groom on his own wedding night?
Don't worry about me.
If one of you has a wife
more beautiful than mine...
and I know that's not possible...
Well, I have a woman even
more beautiful than my wife.
Don't you believe me?
Don't touch me!
Hands off, asshole!
Relax, it's not him.
I don't see her here.
But he'll tell you about her.
Simon!
Don't I have a woman
more beautiful than my wife?
Yes or no?
Of course.
Didn't you find her?
She's actually here.
Do you want me to get her?
Easy does it,
she's not exactly yours.
Let the music play!
Let's dance!
