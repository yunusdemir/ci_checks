This is better than prison.
Silence!
The meeting was called.
Here are the facts, Mr. Judge.
weeks ago,
the defendant, Charlotte Dalrymple,
to eyewitnesses,
assaulted a policeman <br / > in the line of duty.
If this was a first offense,
a short prison term
enough, but...
justice knows you already, Miss Dalrymple
.
You
was arrested last April
for disturbing public order
and refusal to comply.
I distributed leaflets of suffragettes
when I was arrested.
The officers testified:
"We prayed Miss Dalrymple
to leave.
"Then
" she started to scream and stomp
.
"When we managed
to handcuff him,
" she struggled
"with the greatest violence. "
This is not true.
You talk your turn.
How do I defend myself
if you prevent me from speaking?
Anything else?
I am afraid, Mr. Judge.
October 1879, soliciting.
No, it was not me.
My friend, Molly...
was a prostitute at the time.
She has since found an honest job,
it home to my father.
Another thing, Mr. Squyers?
No, Mr. Judge.
Are you sure?
What are you doing crimes
of charity and compassion?
How touching!
kind of charity
mixing prostitution, refusal
and assault police.
Imagine the cost if England
opened the university to women.
Yes, it is very easy
to mock women's lives.
I would like to see you,
not even a day,
for us.
I bet your mockery
would change quickly
in kindness and in despair.
Beware,
your symptoms emerge.
England must recognize
merit and the role of women,
or it will remain a second class country
despite all his riches.
Simply, Miss Dalrymple.
It's obvious, is afflicted

, aggressive and violent.
These symptoms are those of an incurable hysteria.
I would support my opinion

Please, Mr. Squyers.
I called Dr. Mortimer Granville,
please the court.
Mortimer Granville, please.
Mr. Judge.
Do you swear to tell the truth,
whole truth and nothing but the truth?
I swear.
State your identity.
Mortimer Granville.
We are all aware
your reputation.
But please tell us about your experience.
I am a doctor and I treat
women with hysteria.
How many women have you treated?
Hundreds.
always successfully, I think?
I had few complaints.
Is it true
as incurable cases of hysteria
require internment
and hysterectomy?
Answer, please.
Yes.
In principle, yes.
But only in severe cases of recurrence...
Thank you, doctor.
We have already mentioned

Give us your opinion

Mr. J.,

It would be a grave mistake
to detain and mutilate Miss Dalrymple.
Our country would lose the only woman dedication

Fortunately for all,
