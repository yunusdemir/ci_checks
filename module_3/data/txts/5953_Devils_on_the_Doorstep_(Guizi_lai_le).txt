Er Bozi!
Er Bozi!
<i>Sensei!</i>
<i>Have you all been good?</i>
<i>Have some candy.</i>
<i>Good boys!</i>
<i>Watch this.</i>
<i>Which hand?</i>
<i>Smart kid. Try again.</i>
<i>Which hand?</i>
<i>N0.</i>
<i>This one!</i>
Clean water, no dirty water.
<i>One, two, three.</i>
<i>Or I'll knock your block off
Understand?</i>
Yes. You'll have clean water tonight.
1945, NORTH CHINA
THE JAPANESE OCCUPATION
- Let me look at you.
- What for?
Please, let me look!
At what? No!
Come on!
Be quick.
Don't stop!
- Who's there?
- Me.
- Who?
- Me.
- Hurry!
- What'll you do?
The usual.
- Who is it?
- Me.
Close your eyes.
Name.
Dasan Ma.
What's this village called?
Rack-Armor Terrace.
What are you doing up so late?
Thinking.
Well, think away.
I'm leaving two things with you.
I want them both back. Both.
Don't let theJap devils find out.
Any slipup
and you're a dead man.
But they've got a blockhouse here.
It could be hard.
It'll be all right.
“The darkest place
is under the candlestick."
- Understand?
- Yes.
If there's trouble,
who's responsible?
You.
Don't know.
It's alive!
I'll tell that guy!
Dasan Ma!
Listen. In your spare time,
interrogate them.
We'll collect them on
New Year's Eve
together with their statements.
Understand?
Yes.
Who'll collect them?
Me!
It was like this.
Just like this!
Then he jumped the wall and ran off.
So what was his name?
Didn't say.
Called himself “me."
So, what'd he look like?
Don't know. My eyes were closed.
How about his clothes?
Was he tall?
With your eyes closed,
can you see me?
How many were there?
I didn't dare open my eyes!
So what exactly did he say?
He said he'd leave 'em here
till New Year's Eve,
when he'd come for 'em.
He sounded really fierce.
He said, “The darkest place
is under the candlestick."
I'll kill you, turtle-fucker!
You can talk family business later.
Dasan's been with your son's widow
for some time.
We have to talk.
With these good-for-nothings?
Go to bed!
Dad, have some water.
Don't call me dad.
Shameless slut.
A father-in-law
can't talk this way.
Go for me, then!
I'm fed up with you!
- I'll kill you, turtle-fucker!
- Cut it out!
Good fortune is having no troubles,
but misfortune can't be avoided.
Well, is it fortune or misfortune?
What should we do?
Take 'em to the blockhouse.
I'm in with their chief.
- What?
- Hand 'em over.
That's no good. What'll I say
when that guy comes back for 'em?
Tell him to see the Japs.
What would he dare do?
You kidding?
This guy ties up Japs in sacks!
What wouldn't he dare do?
- What are you? A collaborator?
- Seems like it!
I'll throttle one with each hand
and then we'll bury 'em!
That's it!
We'll just dig a hole.
I'll do that.
You would? But that guy said
if anything happens to 'em
or if the Japs find out,
we'd be killed!
- Killed?
- Who'd be killed?
He said he'd kill everyone
in the village.
Aaah!
Nothing.
- What?
- What?
Forget it.
Speak.
I thought we could run away
and leave the sacks here.
What could he do to us?
Sit down!
You made me say it.
If we all have to die anyway,
why don't l just kill you?
Stop it! lf you don't, I'm going.
Come back.
Sit down.
It's unheard of.
He's threatening us all?
I'll throttle 'em, and we'll bury'em.
Bury'em.
No good will come from this.
Such deeds are not
the work of idle men.
Provoke neither those
who dwell in the hills
nor those who come from the sea.
New Year's Eve is five days away.
On that day they'll come.
Steal away with them
and disaster will be averted.
San.
For the sake of the village,
act with care these next few days.
- Er Bozi.
- Yes, Old Uncle?
Don't tell your mother about this.
She's got a big mouth.
I'll keep it to myself, all right?
All right. We can go home.
Wait!
There's something else.
That guy said
we should interrogate them.
Interrogate them?
About what?
<i>Sensei!</i>
<i>Have some candy.</i>
Good boy!
<i>Have another.</i>
<i>Er Bozi, come here!</i>
<i>Coming. Sensei!</i>
Late no good.
<i>If you 're late once more,</i>
<i>one, two, three,</i>
<i>I'll knock your block off!
Understand?</i>
<i>Now, go away!</i>
ORAL STATEMENT
Name?
Speak.
Go on.
Name?
Speak.
Don't kill us.
DON'T KILL US
- First tell me your name.
- Hanchen Dong.
- Age?
- 28.
- Occupation?
- Translation official.
What sort of official is that?
I turn Japanese into Chinese
and Chinese into Japanese.
So... what's his name?
Kosaburo Hanaya.
Have him tell us himself.
<i>Shoot me. Kill me.</i>
<i>If you 've got the guts. Cowards!</i>
How come his name's so long?
<i>Come on
we don't want to be killed</i>
We don't understand.
Turn it into Chinese.
His name's Kosaburo Hanaya.
He's 25.
Has he killed Chinese men?
Violated Chinese women?
<i>Have you killed Chinese men?
Raped Chinese women?</i>
<i>Of course.
That's what I came to China for!</i>
He's new to China.
Hasn't seen any women yet.
He's killed no one. He's a cook.
<i>What? All this talk?
They kill me now or I'll kill them!</i>
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>
<i>I want to anger these cowards.
I won 't cooperate with swine!</i>
Will you two stop chattering?
Speak slower.
Wait for the questions.
He begs you not to kill him.
What else?
Could you ask him
who was that “me” person?
Who was <i>“me”?</i>
Listen.
I want you to tell me who is <i>“me”?</i>
You?
Now I'm stumped.
How would I know who you are?
Not me.
The “me” who nabbed you.
Just tell us who brought you here.
If we knew,
we wouldn't have let him get us.
You mean you don't know either?
Where are we anyway?
Who's interrogating whom.
Stick to the questions.
<i>Just do it.</i>
He begs you not to kill him.
Don't be afraid. Listen.
I'll read it back to you.
“Don't kill us.
Hanchen Dong. Chinese.
28. Translation official.
Don't know.
Kosaburo Hanaya. 25.
Japanese.
Just arrived in China.
Hasn't killed anyone.
Cook. Don't kill me."
ls that correct?
Is it?
More or less.
Well then do what must be done.
Hold on!
I've got more to say!
<i>Kill me!
I'm not afraid to die!</i>
It's a small unit!
There are five machine guns!
<i>You can kill us, but never insult us!</i>
They have nine telephones,
two radio sets <i>...</i>
<i>I'll never surrender!
Or betray the motherland!</i>
An ammunition depot!
<i>We 'll be victorious!
Long live the emperor!</i>
<i>- And 14 horses!
- Shoot me!</i>
That's it!
Good. I'm old enough
to be your grandfather.
To me, you're still kids.
This business,
we were asked to do it.
Give us your fingerprint.
We'll transfer you.
Old Uncle. He's wounded.
It's bleeding.
<i>Escape.</i>
<i>We've got to escape.</i>
<i>We've got to.</i>
<i>No matter what it involves.</i>
<i>Fool. There's no escape.
Better to die now.</i>
<i>These peasants won 't allow it.</i>
<i>It's the guys who captured us
who'll decide our fate.</i>
<i>Idiot. I want to die.</i>
You don't get it, do you?
Pig-brain.
<i>Bastard! What 'd you say?</i>
<i>I said "You 're a clever man.”</i>
<i>Bastard</i>
<i>- Sensei!
- Have some candy</i>
<i>We 're in here!
Hurry. Help us!</i>
San, what'll we do?
<i>Help.</i>
Shut him up!
Stop shouting!
<i>Bastards!</i>
<i> San!
Help!</i>
<i>- Yell, Dong, damn it!
- Help!</i>
Don't smother him.
<i>- Use Japanese! </i>
- Help!
- <i>Help!</i>
- Try and shout now.
San, what'll we do?
<i>Help;</i>
San!
San!
Er Bozi!
Er Bozi!
San, are you crazy?
Get down!
Get down!
- What are you doing? Get down.
- Move.
<i>Help! We're in here!
Quick! Help us!</i>
- Go on, shout.
 <i> - Hurry! Help! </i>
What's wrong? Shout.
I'll help.
Save us!
Save us! Help!
A gunboat is passing by.
You think they can hear you?
I tried out front,
and they couldn't hear.
How noisy is that.
It passes here every day.
Shout your head off if you like.
<i>It seems it passes here every day.</i>
What were you thinking?
<i>We'll try again next time.</i>
<i>Forget it.</i>
<i>Between the noise of the boat
and the band, they'l never hear us.</i>
All right, enough talk. Eat.
Nothing beats a good meal.
But we'd better change
your bandage first.
I'll change your bandage.
- I'll change your-
- Move over.
It's for your own good, you idiot.
<i>Dong tell this woman</i>
<i>she may touch me now,
but I'll touch her later.</i>
<i>- More than once or twice. </i>
- What did he say?
<i>- And more than just touch. </i>
- Just ignore him.
<i>Hanaya, she's helping you.</i>
<i>Don't you have a conscience?</i>
<i>It's the Chinese
who've got no conscience.</i>
<i>- First they shoot, then they help. </i>
- Stop talking.
<i>Mongrels can't even shoot straight.</i>
<i>If they could, you'd be dead</i>
<i>I'll kill myself now.</i>
San!
What the hell is going on?
What now? You faking it?
You want to kill yourself?
Use a sharp stone, not wood.
You stupid fucker.
- Sister-in-law, ignore him.
- I'm not your sister-in-law.
Shut up and eat.
Thank you, brother.
Brother, do me a favor.
Let me go.
We're both Chinese, after all.
Will you shut up?
- Hurry.
- L am.
I was captured once before.
Captain Eight let me go.
Don't give me that.
I have nothing to do with this.
We'll be pals
if you do me a favor.
Of course. Name it.
Come as you are,
leave as you are.
Don't make trouble.
And don't die on me.
All right?
I'm treating you well enough.
Why are you so thoughtless?
He's coming to.
I'll tell you one thing.
Lf you keep this up,
I could get nasty.
- Who's there?
- It's me.
Wake up. It's dawn.
Was it cold last night?
It wasn't warm.
- What's happening in there?
- Quiet so far.
If they don't settle down,
they'll be the death of me.
Have a look.
Brother. I'm so hot.
Can't you take this off me?
I won't kill myself, I promise.
Better hot than dead.
Show some thanks, will you?
I'd be damn pleased if someone fed me
and wiped my ass every day.
But why suffer like this, brother?
I heard you coughing all night.
You were freezing.
Let's make this simple. Release us.
I'm not putting your life in danger.
So don't put mine in danger.
All right? lf l let you go,
I'm a dead man.
Why aren't you eating?
You've got to eat something.
Why isn't he eating? Move over.
You.
Lighten up.
You can't live without eating.
You're human.
Come on, have some.
Eat.
That's good.
What the hell?
<i>Bastard!
Humiliating an Imperial Army soldier!</i>
<i>I'll kill you! Chinese pig!</i>
- What's he want?
- White ﬂour.
White ﬂour?
Where am I gonna get that?
I wouldn't mind some myself.
Just eat.
Don't try to act like
a captain-san here.
If he doesn't eat, he'll starve.
Starve?
Don't eat, then. But this is it.
Let's go.
<i>I sent them to get flour...</i>
<i>Bastard! I'm not eating
and neither are you!</i>
<i>They'll never find flour.</i>
<i>Without it,
you can go on a hunger strike.</i>
<i>They're scared we'll die.</i>
<i>They'll let us go.</i>
<i>We'll be saved</i>
<i>Fool</i>
What? Flour?
Do l look like I'm made of ﬂour?
- Eat me, why don't you?
- Now that's silly.
Isn't it a capital crime
to hoard that stuff?
Trying to send me to the gallows?
Auntie. This is a matter of decency.
Decency?
You've a mistress in your bed
and Japs in your cellar.
You've got some nerve
talking about decency.
Son of a bitch.
- You swearing at me?
- No, not you. Er Bozi.
I'm his mother.
Curses at him travel straight to me.
You don't understand.
He swears at me too.
He hasn't kept his word.
He said he wouldn't tell you.
If he lied to me,
he wouldn't be my son.
He'd be yours.
Whatever you say.
But I really need your help.
Auntie.
You're fond of me, aren't you?
I've done so much for these two men <i>-</i>
for the sake of the village.
I've slept with my clothes on.
I've spent nights in the cellar.
I've used all my bedding
to pad the walls and ﬂoors.
I've wrapped those men in my blankets.
That's your fault.
I had no choice.
The Jap's threatening suicide.
He won't eat
unless his food's made of white ﬂour.
Otherwise, he'll starve himself.
It's a mess.
If you care about me
you won't let me leave empty-handed,
will you?
That's exactly how you'll leave today.
A man's going to starve.
Let him starve.
Japs are monsters anyway.
That's no good. lf they starve,
our village is done for.
I'd rather die than be a collaborator.
What are you talking about?
This guy risks his neck to bring 'em,
asks us to look after 'em.
And we let 'em starve?
What's a collaborator?
That's a collaborator.
Keep talking, there's no ﬂour.
Then...
what's in here?
- Nothing.
- There's ﬂour inside the chest,
in a cloth bag.
- Who told you that?
- Who?
The one who keeps secrets.
He tells me stuff too.
That damn son of mine.
I don't care anyway. There is none.
Auntie.
How's this?
I'll repay you double what I take.
- Triple it. There's none.
- Four times.
Five times
and there's still none.
How about six?
Seven and I'll give none.
All right, eight then.
<i>Dong. Teach me some Chinese.</i>
<i>- Why?
- I want to swear at them.</i>
<i>To use the most terrible words.</i>
<i>I'll infuriate them,</i>
<i>and they'll have to kill me.</i>
<i>The Chinese hate people</i>
<i>who curse their ancestors.</i>
<i>Bastard!
Teach me now.</i>
<i>Yes, sir.</i>
Cut it out.
At a time like this,
thinking of that.
You've heard them call us
brother and sister-in-law.
Besides, when I saw Auntie,
I told her all about us.
What'd you say?
I said... it is what it is.
Have you no shame?
She said no story, no ﬂour.
She wasn't nasty about it.
Things are what they are.
Why not just admit it?
Don't push it.
They've all been too busy
to think about us.
After tonight, when those two leave,
how can I walk in the streets
with everyone talking behind my back?
What can I do?
If a big man like you doesn't know,
why ask me?
Well,
I'll... marry you.
You have to anyway.
- What are you saying?
- You have no choice.
- Who's there?
- Me.
It's him.
It's me.
Don't use that word.
It scares me.
I've got their statement.
When that guy comes,
give him this.
I'm glad I didn't forget.
Anyway, we've done it.
Right.
Once they've left,
we can celebrate New Year's
all over again.
<i>They're here, Dong.</i>
<i>The time's come.</i>
<i>I hear their footsteps.</i>
<i>I can see them taking up
their weapons.</i>
<i>I want to turn the curses
you've taught me</i>
<i>into bullets to fire at them.</i>
<i>I want to enrage them.</i>
<i>Insult them.</i>
<i>Enrage them.</i>
<i>Insult them.</i>
<i>Dong.</i>
<i>Good-bye forever!</i>
Happy New Year,
brother and sister-in-law!
You're my granddad,
I'm your son!
Happy New Year,
brother and sister-in-law.
You're my granddad,
I'm your son.
The words are nice.
Why does he sound so angry?
Japs sound the same
whether they're happy or angry.
Why do you think we call them devils?
Happy New Year,
brother and sister-in-law!
You're my granddad,
I'm your son.
Enough, enough.
I get the message.
But your generations are mixed up.
If l'm your granddad,
you're my grandson.
Not my son. See?
<i>How come they're not angry?</i>
<i>The Japanese are always cursing them.</i>
<i>They're used to it.</i>
Happy New Year,
brother and sister-in-law!
Okay, okay. Shush.
Twice is enough.
We've made you dumplings.
Just what you asked for.
- Did you teach him that?
- Yes. It's the spring festival.
I taught him propitious phrases
to thank you both.
Nice of you.
Now, eat up. It's your last chance.
By tonight, you'll be on the road.
- Let's bring the table over.
- Okay.
Hold on. We'll set this up.
Eat heartily.
<i>Hoarders.</i>
<i>I'll kill you for sure.</i>
<i>- No chance of that.
- Why not?</i>
<i>"On the road” means " to die”
in Chinese.</i>
<i>This is our last meal.</i>
<i>We 're goners.</i>
<i>Why don't they act
like they're gonna kill us?</i>
<i>Even when the Chinese kill someone
their expression doesn't change.</i>
<i>How are they gonna kill us?</i>
<i>- You araid of dying?
- Of course not.</i>
<i>I just feel stupid dying this way.</i>
<i>But I'm not afraid.</i>
<i>I won't beg for mercy
I won't.</i>
Shall we do it?
Move aside.
Let 'em finish their meal.
Untie them.
Please, one favor.
Send my parents a message for me,
in the northeast.
Of course. Don't worry.
You'll be on the road soon.
And whatever happens, happens.
Enjoy your dumplings.
All right! l will!
And then I'll go on the road.
I lived by my mouth.
Now I'll die by it.
If only l hadn't learned Japanese.
In my next life,
I'll come back a mute.
Eat up.
Or we'll be late.
Tell him we've still got to trouble you
to get back into those sacks.
<i>What?</i>
<i>They're putting us back
into those sacks.</i>
What now?
The Japs are like this.
They cry, they sing.
Well, maybe.
Before he goes,
we should give him a drink?
<i>I want a drink!</i>
He'd like a drink.
Let's get some wine from old man Qi.
San.
Do you think
they'll give us a reward?
<i>Advance.</i>
<i>- It's time for lunch.
- I'm not going.</i>
<i>Not going to the blockhouse
for lunch?</i>
<i>No. We 're having
Chinese chicken today.</i>
<i>You serious?</i>
<i>Know how to get a chicken
from a Chinese?</i>
<i>"Excuse me, may I have a chicken?”</i>
<i>Idiot. You wouldn't get
a fart that way.</i>
<i>Watch me.</i>
<i>Bastard! Hand over that chicken!</i>
<i>Bastard! Hand over that chicken!</i>
<i>You're pathetic. You'l get thrashed.
Watch me.</i>
<i>You gotta stare 'em down.
Act like a devil and scare 'em.</i>
<i>Get it?</i>
<i>Bastard! Give me that chicken!</i>
Holy crap!
<i>What the hell!
Halt!</i>
<i>Bastard!</i>
<i>You scared the shit out of me.</i>
What you do?
I'm from the village.
No leave village.
- You go back.
- Go.
<i>Go over there.</i>
<i>Come here.</i>
<i>Head down.</i>
<i>Here, have another.
Come here.</i>
<i>Stand back.</i>
- No go out, understand?
- Yes.
- No go out.
- I understand.
<i>Understand? Son of a bitch.</i>
- Understand?
- Yes.
- Good
- Yes.
<i>Let's go.</i>
<i>See?
That's how you deal with them.</i>
/ <i>see.</i>
<i>Hold on. Get it.</i>
<i>Don't let it get away.</i>
<i>Halt.</i>
You're back?
What's wrong? Speak.
What's all this?
Say something.
<i>I'm going to eat you.</i>
<i>Look, it's him.</i>
<i>You. Damn it.
What are you doing here?</i>
<i>I ordered you to stay
inside the circle. Bastard!</i>
<i>Japanese.</i>
<i>Japanese.</i>
<i>You must be dreaming</i>
<i>No step out. Understand?</i>
<i>- Yes.
- Maruyama. The chicken.</i>
Captain-san.
This what you're after?
<i>- Bastard! Hand over that chicken.
- Forget it, moron.</i>
Captain-san.
Want me to kill it?
<i>- Now you're talking.
- Let's sit over there.</i>
<i>- No. </i>
- Bastard!
<i>I heard it. “Bastard.”</i>
<i>It's for real.</i>
<i>Japanese speaking Japanese.</i>
<i>Soldiers of the Imperial Army.</i>
You stay here.
I'll get some kids to make noise.
The Japs want more water.
<i>It's true.
There are Japanese up there.</i>
<i>Thank heavens.</i>
- How'd they get here?
- I ran into them.
- You idiot.
- I'll knock your block off.
Captain-san.
Go fan the fire.
Our chicken is nearly ready.
<i>I'm going to scream.</i>
<i>They still won't hear you.</i>
<i>Hanaya.
I've got an idea.</i>
<i>Don 't worry about us.</i>
<i>We've got our own lunch.</i>
<i>We'll save you the bones.</i>
<i>It's goddamn delicious.</i>
Why did he hit you?
- I said “knock your block off."
- Can't you say the opposite?
Well, you try.
I can only say <i>bakayaro.</i>
It's worse.
Say <i>baka</i>-no-<i>yaro.</i>
Cut the crap. I'll watch them.
If they head for the cellar,
I'll take 'em on.
<i>Please save us.</i>
<i>Pease save us!</i>
<i>Attack!</i>
Son of a bitch.
<i>Sensei!</i>
San, he's gone inside.
Move. Move.
<i>What are you doing with that?</i>
Captain-san.
It's for killing the donkey.
- <i>Donkey?</i>
- Eat donkey.
<i>This moron is terrified
at the very sight of us.</i>
<i>He thinks we can eat
a donkey.</i>
<i>Idiot.</i>
<i>'That pretty maid'</i>
<i>'is a bird on high'</i>
<i>'I'm going to do my best- '</i>
<i>Maruyama. Get your gun.</i>
<i>What are you doing?</i>
I'm getting you another chicken.
This guy- very good.
Save it. We eat next time.
- Understand?
- Yes.
<i>- We should be at our posts.
- Right. Playtime's over.</i>
<i>Two telephone lines to set up.</i>
<i>Why's he always waving
a knife around?</i>
Go back. No move.
<i>- You scared?
- Course not. Not with you around.</i>
<i>Sensei.</i>
Look at this.
Damn it.
<i>What now?</i>
<i>That idiot is still inside the circle.</i>
<i>You're something else.
You've got these mongrels worked out.</i>
<i>My respects.</i>
<i>I can teach you a few things.
I'm still learning too.</i>
<i>- You? Still learning?
- You're never too old to learn.</i>
<i>How was that chicken?</i>
<i>Delicious.</i>
- Fucking bastards.
- What are you doing?
Where's he going?
<i>Japanese soldiers!
They're coming!</i>
Fuck you, Jap. Fuck.
Fucking bastards!
Move!
Turtle-fuckers!
What the fuck is this about?
So you pull this on me?
Trying to get me killed?
Get this straight.
You try and get me killed
and I'll kill you first.
I left the village,
crossed the river,
climbed the mountain,
entered the town,
went to ask for Pockmarked Li.
- Get to the point.
- This is the point.
You always leave the village,
cross the river.
If l didn't leave the village,
how could I cross the river?
- Give me some water.
- Go on.
- Where was I?
- Crossing the river...
Get to the point.
- You saw Pockmarked Li.
- I didn't say that.
- Yes, you did.
- I said I saw Captain Five.
What did Captain Five say?
He said,
“Didn't I tell you what to do?"
I said,
“No, I've never met you before."
He said, “Are you from Lower Village?"
I said, “No.
I'm from Rack-Armor Terrace."
He said, “Rack-Armor Terrace?
 We've never left anyone there.
Do whatever you have to."
I said, “Like what?"
He said, “lsn't there
a blockhouse there?
What are you waiting for?
Do the deed.“
So this captain said “do the deed.“
Yeah.
He gestured like this.
“Do it-.
Tell us again.
What was that gesture?
Was it like this? Or like that?
- Show me again.
- Like this? Or like that?
- Like this.
- So he meant kill 'em.
- No.
- What do you mean?
Like this. Like this.
Of course he meant kill 'em.
Looks like it.
There's an old saying:
Better to obey than have respects to pay.
Well, better obey then.
Old Uncle, if he wanted us to kill 'em,
why didn't he say so?
Why say “do the deed"?
Men in high positions
can't always say what they mean.
It was so clear. First those guys
yelled out to the brass band.
Then, today,
they tagged the chicken.
What's next?
Our necks are on the line.
Did he say how to do it?
No.
Or who should do it?
No. He doesn't know us.
How could he?
He knows you.
He thought I was from Lower Village.
I never saw him before.
- This is a hard one.
- What's so hard?
There's “peeling the skin."
Japs are all bastards.
More water.
You peel one, I'll throttle 'em.
Twist their necks and bury 'em!
Shut up.
Bury 'em?
That's an idea.
So...
- San.
- Old Uncle.
It's not that I'm afraid.
How can I put this?
It's just not right.
We were told to look after them.
We can't just decide to kill them.
It's not good.
Besides, that Captain Five
who Liu Wang found
didn't drop 'em on us.
His orders don't count.
What if Captain Four or Captain Seven
comes for 'em? What then?
So why don't you go yourself?
Go find Captain Four or Seven.
Don't be stupid.
It's up to you really.
You got them here. Shouldn't you do it?
What? l got them here?
You think I went to their homes
and invited them round?
I had a gun to my head.
That's how l got them.
He forced me to look after them.
If we don't, he'll kill us all.
These last six months, I've eaten badly,
hardly slept, and I'm in debt.
While you all slept soundly,
I haven't been under a quilt
all winter.
Why? Isn't it for our whole village?
Give me that water.
Slurping all over the place.
Dasan's got a point.
- Of course I do.
- Well...
- Er Bozi?
- Don't look at me like that.
I'm not a coward.
You must have a good reason to do that.
I've got a big mouth.
Just like my mother.
One slip of the tongue
and we're all done for.
We are still here
because I've kept my mouth shut.
I sensei this and that all day long
to keep from talking.
That's my contribution.
Some contribution. Sensei!
You collaborator.
- You do it then.
- Well, Liu Wang?
Me? I could do it. What am I afraid of?
But let's get this straight.
You know the saying
“stick your neck out"? That's me.
I was nearly killed today.
Why do I go on about the village,
the river? Because it makes me sick.
In my dreams it's leave,
cross, leave, cross.
And you scold me for slurping?
Give me that.
I'll throttle 'em
and we'll dig a pit and bury'em.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
If none of you will do it, I will.
- That's not right.
- No?
We'll draw lots then.
Fate will decide.
Whoever gets the red bean is it.
Old Uncle,
it's too big a job for one person.
Well, add a second one.
Forget it.
I've got both.
Give me some water.
Give him some water.
Here you go, San.
San.
What can I say?
What's there to say?
Leave 'em to me. I'll throttle 'em...
Shut up!
I need two people.
Helpers.
- I'll dig the pit.
- So will I.
Good.
You two dig the pit.
Dasan will do the deed.
Let's not put it off.
Let's move tonight. Agreed?
Yes.
San. The hole's ready.
It's right here.
We'll wait down there.
They've brought this over for you.
To help you over the shock.
Er Bozi's mother says
don't worry about repaying the ﬂour.
She says try and put it
out of your head.
- Eat up. I'm off.
- Yu'er.
What is it?
Yu'er.
Don't touch me!
Whatever you do, don't touch me.
If for nothing else,
for the child in my belly.
- Are you all right?
- Don't touch me.
- Who's there?
- Me.
Stop saying "me-"
Here's some food.
- Where's your mom?
- She's not coming.
No?
This is terrible!
Uncle San.
I'll kill you, turtle-fucker!
I didn't kill anyone.
That's it.
<i>Advance!</i>
- You.
- What's with you?
Anybody See you?
No one.
Quick. Shut the door.
Ma, I'm back.
So you are.
Only one candy today.
What's with Uncle?
Nothing. Don't worry.
- I'm going to Grandpa's.
- Off you go.
Yu'er.
Let's...
run away.
We'll take Little Thresher
and the old man.
Well?
Starting tomorrow,
don't take them any food.
What?
If l don't, who will?
<i>There are Japanese captives
inside the Great Wall.</i>
<i>There are Japanese captives
inside the Great Wall.</i>
<i>Too long.
The kid'll never remember it.</i>
<i>True.</i>
<i>Nijonjin</i> means uncle.
<i>Chojo</i> is candy.
<i>Iru yo</i> is give.
Repeat after me.
<i>Nijonjin chojo iru yo.</i>
<i>"Japanese inside the Great Wall.”</i>
You say it.
<i>Japanese inside the Great Wall.</i>
<i>He can do it!</i>
<i>Japanese inside the Great Wall.</i>
<i>Japanese. Japanese.</i>
<i>Japanese.</i>
<i>Japs?</i>
<i>Sensei.</i>
<i>Sensei.</i>
<i>The great Japanese.</i>
<i>The great Japanese have no candy
for you today.</i>
- Chop off my head!
- What are you doing?
Me too! Go ahead!
I can explain!
- Those guys are at Fenghuotai?
- Yes, inside the wall.
You taking them food?
They still alive?
- Yes. Listen <i>-</i>
- Why?
Enough's been said.
First they shout out to the brass band,
then they tag the chicken.
Now they're using Little Thresher.
Three times unlucky.
We're going to lose our heads.
No doubt about it.
- I ask you. Should they be killed?
- Sure.
So why didn't you do it?
It's either them or us.
Where'd those guys come from?
Who brought them?
What are you saying?
I don't know who brought 'em here.
You don't?
It would take at least two men
to drag those two sacks.
Even four.
Four? Try five or six.
And you saw nothing?
- Don't you have eyes?
- They were closed.
Really? You opened the door?
You did it with your eyes closed?
No, I closed 'em after.
I say you saw everything.
I didn't. lt was dark.
I couldn't see a thing.
Cut it out.
Tell us what you're getting out of this.
Nothing.
Nothing? I don't believe it.
If not, why protect them?
You said you'd pay me back eightfold.
Where's that coming from?
Yes, we all see through it now.
You're just bullshitting about
the threat to the village.
Who is this killer? Let him come.
I'll sit at home and wait.
Is he going to kill me? Would he dare?
Only your life's in danger.
- Can you pipe down?
- Pipe down?
What am I afraid of?
The Japs have been here for eight years.
Eight years.
And have they touched a hair
on my head?
My behavior is right and proper.
Wherever I go, they look up to me.
Ma. Enough.
Little Thresher, don't hide.
You speak Japanese?
You can go to the blockhouse,
but first show Uncle San
what you've learned.
Go on.
<i>The japanese are inside the Great Wall.</i>
Don't hit him!
Hit me if you dare!
Come on!
I'll be frank.
The child in my belly was conceived
the night those men came here.
If Dasan kills 'em,
it will curse my baby.
You want us to kill 'em?
And then you ignore us?
Dasan looks like a ghost.
Now that they're still alive,
you come at us with this business.
We can't do anything right.
You know all the answers.
We didn't kill anybody.
We can't kill and we won't!
We can't.
I'm afraid. I couldn't do it.
Yu'er, how can you talk like that?
We all see what's going on
between you and Dasan,
but have we said anything?
You defend him
like he's your husband.
If you can't kill anyone,
why should we?
You're scared to bear a cursed child.
And us?
We'll all be cursed souls soon enough.
Dasan. I want my ﬂour back.
Eightfold. Pay me back now.
Look at yourself.
Do you look like a man?
Whether Dasan's a man or not
is for me to say.
Don't tell me
you'd know better than me.
Wanna go to the blockhouse?
Go then!
I'll lead you there!
No big deal!
I'll tell you this, though.
If they come down after us,
no one will escape.
We'll all pay with our lives.
Who are you threatening?
If we go, we die.
And if we stay, we die.
If it's all the same,
just behead me now.
Please, get it over with.
Otherwise, I'm not moving.
Say something, Old Uncle.
Good fortune is having no troubles,
but misfortune can't be avoided.
I'm the youngest.
Kill me first.
I'm in this too.
Let him kill us all. Here.
Don't push me.
If you push me,
I could do anything.
Fine. It's not too late for action.
- I'll help you dig the trench.
- Me too.
- Let's do it.
- Me?
Do it?
I'll run away.
<i>Next.</i>
<i>Come here.</i>
<i>- It's all beans.
- All right.</i>
<i>- Move.
- Hold on! Halt!</i>
<i>Show me.</i>
<i>Show me.</i>
<i>This way</i>
Beard, different with photo.
<i>Cut short.</i>
<i>Understand?</i>
- <i>Cut short.</i>
- Short.
- Understand, you?
- I understand.
<i>Move it.</i>
<i>Next.</i>
<i>Bearded guy, come here.</i>
Welcome the Japanese
to the neighborhood.
800 years ago,
we were all one brood.
We all write with characters
and our soups use pickles.
When they beat us,
it really tickles.
If they call me <i>bakayaro,</i>
I think it's good.
The Imperial Army
gives us “mixi“ food.
We love the Imperial Army
like family...
- Where you from?
- Rack-Armor Terrace.
- Name?
- Dasan.
- Who sent you?
- Old Uncle.
Old Uncle?
No wonder you called me
brother-in-law.
What's up?
Well, where to start?
You want to hire an assassin.
Am I right?
Didn't Old Uncle tell you
about my marksmanship?
He said you can hit a ﬂy
at 100 paces.
That's right <i>-</i> but with a gun.
A nine-chamber automatic.
The further the target,
the more accurate the shot.
Naturally.
 There's a blockhouse
at Rack-Armor Terrace, yeah?
Yeah.
- The village is as small as an ass cheek?
- Yeah.
How can you use a gun then?
This is a job for a sword.
But Old Uncle is asking you.
You can't say no, can you?
- Can't do it.
- You can't do it?
Can't do it.
All right.
- What are you doing?
- Going home.
You can go,
but you gotta leave the beans.
What? You won't help,
but you want the beans?
I can't help you out,
but you gotta leave them.
You want to kill a Jap
but don't want anyone to know, right?
Right.
- It's a secret, right?
- Yeah.
So, I'll keep your secret.
It's like this.
If l don't take something as payment,
how can you trust me to keep quiet?
I don't need your beans.
I just want you to feel okay about this.
Silly man.
You've simply come to the wrong place.
I make tofu. lf you throw in sorghum,
would it still be tofu?
The more sorghum you put in,
the less it'll be like tofu.
In the future, remember:
If you want a swordsman,
don't go to the one with the gun.
Do you get my logic?
- No.
- No?
Let me show you what I mean.
<i>Attention!</i>
<i>Attention!</i>
What'll we do?
Take a detour.
Halt.
What are we afraid of?
Running means
we've done wrong.
<i>Sensei.</i>
Get down.
They must have lost this battle.
They usually kowtow before me.
<i>They're back.
Yayoi. Look.</i>
<i>They've been gone so long.</i>
<i>At last they're back.</i>
<i>Yayoi, what's wrong?</i>
<i>Matsuno?</i>
<i>Matsuno!</i>
<i>Idiots! Go back inside!</i>
<i>Whats all this fuss?
Shameless hussy.</i>
Look at him.
You need wits and bravery.
Silly man.
It's not just a family matter.
Besides,
I've got a Chinese heart too.
So you do.
Let's go.
Brother-in-law.
Where are you taking me?
- To the military police.
- What?
To the bathhouse.
You know the empress Tz'u-hsi?
Yeah.
How about the eight ministers?
Yeah. Uh, no.
Didn't think you would.
Darlings of the court.
All beheaded.
Know who wielded the sword?
No.
- Old man Liu.
- Really?
The day of the beheadings,
a sea of people surrounded North Gate.
It was packed.
- South Gate.
- Right, South Gate.
Did they come to see
the eight ministers?
No.
They cheered at every head
old man Liu cut.
Watching him use his sword
was like tasting the finest wine.
They even celebrated it in poems.
Old man Liu, does he worry
that people will hate him?
No. They never hate him.
They're grateful.
The descendants of those he's executed
bring him gifts
every day, every year,
every generation.
Old man Liu,
which generation are we up to?
See? The fifth generation.
Do you know why?
No.
Because he's helped them
up to heaven.
His blade is like a passing breeze.
Before they know it,
they're in the land of the immortals.
Their last vision
is of Liu with his sword.
Gratitude wells up within them.
You know how they show it?
No.
Their head
rolls exactly nine times,
looks back at him
and blinks three times.
The corners of their mouths turn up.
You've heard of “greeting death
with a smile?" That's it.
Say no more.
What can I give you to do this job?
Oh. lf old man Liu likes you,
he won't take a cent.
If he doesn't,
mountains of gold won't move him.
Say no more. Old man Liu,
I can't even offer you beans.
But I'll kowtow on behalf
of my whole village.
“The Great Wall still stands,
yet the emperor Ch'in Shih Huang
is no more!"
<i>Few Imperial Army soldiers
get taken prisoner.</i>
<i>Fewer still are
the prisoners of peasants.</i>
<i>I might be the only one.</i>
<i>Oh, Fate.</i>
<i>At least I've killed about
20 Chinese.</i>
<i>Worthless though their lives were.</i>
<i>Aren't 20 lives worth your one?</i>
<i>Sure.</i>
<i>The Chinese are people too.</i>
<i>It's a pity.</i>
<i>A soldier should die in battle.</i>
<i>To die at the hands of these peasants</i>
<i>is so unheroic.</i>
<i>Heroic?</i>
<i>I can help you.</i>
<i>How the hell can you help me?</i>
<i>I could eat your flesh</i>
<i>like sashimi.</i>
Shut your traps.
For fuck's sake.
What do you think?
I'm speechless.
You're a master.
How's the time?
The moon is bright, the stars are few.
Perfect.
And how are they?
- They've eaten their last meals.
- Let's do it.
A Jap?
I'm speechless.
A Chinese?
- Words fail me.
- The Jap first.
Collect the corpses.
- You've worked hard.
- It was nothing.
He's still alive! Grab him!
- They're not dead!
- Impossible.
They're jumping around!
Headless chickens
jump around too.
Stop.
But their heads are still
on their shoulders.
<i>Let' me go!</i>
- Got him?
- Grab him.
- What's going on?
- They're not dead.
Try again!
I'm not called
“One Strike Liu" for nothing.
They're just not fated to die.
My brilliant reputation has been
destroyed in an instant.
I never imagined that because of you
I'd lose my honor.
Especially this late in life!
Heaven help me!
Old Uncle.
The slate is clean between us.
All of you take care.
We'll meet again.
<i>But - But...</i>
<i>Teach me to curse my emperor.
They'd love that.</i>
<i>They don't know who he is.</i>
<i>Teach me to say nice things.
I'll do anything not to be killed.</i>
<i>Hanaya, you've said all the nice things
there are to say.</i>
<i>What?</i>
“Happy New Year,
brother and sister-in-law.
You're my granddad,
I'm your son."
<i>- I won't say that again.
- Remember?</i>
<i>I'll never curse them again.</i>
<i>You never did curse them.</i>
<i>“Happy New Year,
brother and sister-in-law.</i>
<i>You're my granddad
I'm your son.”</i>
<i>That's what it meant.</i>
<i>You tricked me!</i>
<i>Educated people are so evil.</i>
<i>I hate you educated people!</i>
<i>- What son of shitty samurai are you?
- I'm no samurai! I'm a peasant!</i>
<i>My family raises silk worms!
Not samurai!</i>
<i>If a warrior dies with no witnesses,
he's no warrior!</i>
<i>You're no fucking actor either,
just a sergeant.</i>
<i>I hate stupid Japanese people like you!</i>
<i>Lowlife peasant!</i>
<i>No fucking dignity at all!</i>
<i>You're the lowlife!</i>
<i>- Worse than the peasants!
- Bastard.</i>
<i>The people here gave up</i>
<i>their own rations</i>
<i>to keep us alive these six months.</i>
<i>That woman even dressed my wounds.</i>
<i>She's got feelings for me.</i>
Happy New Year,
brother and sister-in-law.
<i>She'd do the same for me
if l was wounded.</i>
<i>- You're so pathetic!
- Bastard!</i>
Stop it. Stop it.
- Shut up!
- Shut up.
<i>It's not going to save
your fucking life.</i>
<i>I've got an idea.</i>
Hanaya says
if we take them back home,
we'll get two carts of grain.
It'll be New Year's Day every day.
Lives for grain.
- You go.
- You go.
- You first.
- You first.
Speak.
I say no deal.
- I agree. No deal.
- No deal.
- Why not?
- Don't know. Doesn't feel right.
- I say let's do it.
- Why?
Why not?
I already said why.
It doesn't feel right.
That's not enough.
What'll we gain by not doing it?
If you say no, take 'em home yourselves
and look after 'em like a wife.
What'll we gain?
You tell us
what the disadvantages are?
What if that guy comes back for 'em?
He said he'd be here on New Year's Eve.
Half a year has passed.
What if he never comes?
We gonna keep 'em our whole lives?
Does a deal
count as collaboration?
Collaboration?
You always throw that word around.
You help Japs kill Chinese,
you're a collaborator.
But asking them for some grain?
If you return the Jap but don't ask
for grain, that's collaboration.
Who grew it anyway?
We Chinese did.
We've got our backs to the sun.
Our sweat ﬂows, irrigating the soil.
Why should the Japs
get it for free?
I'll take the grain from their mouths
and put it in ours.
And not just ours.
All our relatives will get their share.
That's collaborating?
You'd call me a collaborator for that?
Well, no.
If everyone was like us
and took the Japs
and traded 'em in,
what would the world be like then?
The Japs would be the collaborators.
Say we agree.
- I say no.
- Explain yourself.
You're in with <i>sensei</i>,
But I slapped Hanaya.
True.
And what about One Strike Liu?
- Say we disagree.
- What do you mean?
I was gonna say,
Liu Wang,
the fact you hit Hanaya hardly counts.
How often have the Japs hit you?
One Strike Liu
is a more serious matter.
What do we do then?
I've been thinking about it.
We'll say the guy
who captured 'em came back
to kill them.
We talked ourselves blue in the face,
but got rid of him,
saving their lives.
That's believable.
- I believe it.
- And why not? They're not dead.
We saved 'em, didn't we?
And for that, they're gonna punish you?
They've got to reward you.
It still doesn't feel right.
Why not?
I found One Strike Liu,
and I'm not worried.
You won't eat food that's
put in your mouth? Are you a coward?
I give you men. You give us grain.
I've done you no wrong.
Would you treat me badly?
Aren't our hearts made of ﬂesh?
I'll throttle 'em both
- and twist their necks like fried dough.
- Forget the fried dough.
No ﬂour, no fried dough.
Liu Wang is right.
No ﬂour, no fried dough.
If we don't go,
we can't get the grain.
Grain.
There'll be enough grain
to feed the whole village for a year.
Auntie, I said
I'd pay you back eightfold.
It'll be eighty-fold.
- You said it, not me.
- I sure did.
Forget the two carts of grain.
If it was two carts of shit,
I'd still do it.
I'd do it for nothing.
I don't want them another day.
If you're scared, don't come.
Fine. I'll go myself.
I'll take those two carts of grain
bag by bag.
I'll bring it back to you myself.
I'll deliver it
and put it in your mouths if l have to.
You'll eat it and be grateful.
And you'll feel remorse in your gut.
Calm down.
No one said they weren't going.
- No.
- No.
So, we're going?
What an effort.
Give me some water.
Why do you have to make him cry?
Yes.
I'll make the decision for us.
Hanaya wants to see you.
Yes.
Hanaya.
I want to ask you three things.
Answer truthfully.
How will you guarantee our safety,
and how will you raise
the question of the grain?
<i>I'll tell you how.</i>
<i>We all come
from the same county.</i>
<i>Captain Inokichi Sakatsuka
is from my village.</i>
<i>We grew up together. We're friends.
Translate.</i>
He says:
“We all come from the same village.
I know Captain Sakatsuka.
We grew up together."
No wonder. The same village.
- So he's a peasant too. Just like us.
- A son of the soil.
<i>Yes, that's it.</i>
<i>I'm a son of the soil!</i>
<i>But I'm a sergeant too,
in charge of food supplies.</i>
<i>The Imperial Army has a policy
of rewarding those who help it.</i>
<i>So I can promise
you will get your grain.</i>
He says...
<i>And I also want to say
that I've been well treated here.</i>
<i>You saved my life.
You'll be perfectly safe. Translate!</i>
“I'm a sergeant
in charge of foodstuffs.
The Imperial Army rewards those
who help it. You'll get your grain.
You've looked after me well.
You saved my life.
Your safety is guaranteed."
I thought he was a cook.
Now he's a sergeant?
Brother, I was afraid you were going
to kill us. So l made that up.
Made it up?
Maybe you've made up all this too.
At a time like this, would I dare?
<i>What?</i>
<i>They're afraid I'm making this up.</i>
<i>You better not be, Dong!
It's a matter of life and death!</i>
<i>Stop lying.</i>
<i>If I was playing games now,</i>
<i>I'd be the loser.</i>
- What are you talking about?
- He's afraid I'm lying.
If l was, I'd only be hurting myself.
Sit back down.
<i>Sit down.</i>
Listen.
I don't care what rank you hold.
Since you've been in our village,
we've fed you,
looked after your wounds,
cut your hair and beard.
In your heart, you know
we've treated you well.
- Very well. What else is there?
- Ask him.
<i>He says they've fed you, healed you,</i>
<i>cut your hair
and treated you well, right?</i>
<i>Like members of their own family</i>
<i>Especially Dasan and his pregnant wife.
They've been great.</i>
You've treated us like family,
especially Dasan and his wife.
Look, let's not talk about that.
<i>Don't talk about that.</i>
<i>What? The second question?</i>
And the second question?
You answered it
before I even asked.
Well,
is there anything else?
<i>You've answered everything.</i>
He finally looks happy.
The swordsman wasn't one of you.
I could tell from his accent
he was one of those who captured us.
You persuaded him to leave
and saved our lives.
I've told him this. We thank you.
It was nothing.
<i>We were talking about the swordsman.</i>
<i>- Nothing to do with you people.
- That's right.</i>
So long as you know that.
That's fine.
Sit back down.
Since that's the case,
I'll read this back to you.
If you've no problem with it,
you can sign it.
<i>They've got an agreement to sign.</i>
“The Japanese Kosaburo Hanaya
arrived in our village at year's end.
It was cold. He was frightened,
disheveled, and wounded by a bullet.
Who brought him here, we do not know.
Six months passed.
Winter turned to summer.
The villagers were kind and righteous.
They did all they could to help <i>...</i>
clothing, sheltering and feeding him
despite the hardship.
We've all been through this turmoil.
We'll never forget this experience.
Hanaya in gratitude promised us
two carts of grain as a reward.
We happily accepted this offer.
Now Hanaya and his translator
return to you.
And hereafter,
both sides will live in peace.
Signed by the Chinese and the Japanese."
<i>Captain!</i>
<i>Captain!</i>
<i>Hanaya is back!</i>
<i>Captain!</i>
<i>Hanaya is back!</i>
<i>- What's happening?
- Hanaya is back!</i>
<i>Captain!</i>
<i>Hanaya is back?</i>
<i>Yes. Hanaya is back.</i>
<i>I'm back.</i>
<i>I'm really back!</i>
<i>I'm back!</i>
<i>- How come he's still alive?
- What happened to his uniform?</i>
<i>Did he get taller?</i>
<i>Attention!</i>
<i>Captain, sir!
Kosaburo Hanaya</i>
<i>has returned to the ranks!</i>
Dasan. Look. What a mess.
Oh, no.
This is terrible.
Get off. Off. Give me a hand.
<i>Pull 'em apart.</i>
- Push.
- He won't budge.
We didn't plan this.
<i>"We didn't plan this.”</i>
We didn't tell him to do that.
<i>"We didn't tell him to do that. ”</i>
Fucking hell.
Captain-san.
We're so sorry.
<i>Turn around!</i>
<i>- Attention.
- Yes, sir.</i>
<i>- Know why we're beating you?
- No.</i>
<i>What? Stupid pig.</i>
<i>- Now you understand?
- Yes, sir.</i>
<i>Say it. Why are we beating you?</i>
<i>I shouldn't have come back alive.</i>
<i>You think dying would've solved it?</i>
<i>Yes, but...</i>
<i>Your name's inscribed
in the Yasukuni Shrine.</i>
<i>I've already informed your father.</i>
<i>You're the goddamn hero of the village.
And now you're back, alive.</i>
<i>You have lost face for the village
and the Imperial Army.</i>
<i>Worse, you've returned
with a herd of Chinese swine.</i>
<i>Bastard.</i>
<i>They weren't the ones who captured me.
They saved me.</i>
<i>First they captured you,
then the pigs saved you.</i>
<i>You know how many died in that battle?
If they didn't ambush us, who did?</i>
<i>I was taken to them
only after l was shot.</i>
<i>I never meant to surrender. I...</i>
<i>What are you saying?
Swine.</i>
<i>Tell us, were you a prisoner or not?</i>
<i>Speak.</i>
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>I passed out,
and when I awoke</i>
<i>I was tied up in a sack.</i>
<i>Because you passed out,
you think it's all right?</i>
<i>Couldn't you have committed suicide?</i>
<i>I had no opportunity!</i>
<i>Bastard! You need an opportunity
to commit suicide?</i>
<i>But...</i>
<i>- You think you deserve to live?
- Move!</i>
<i>You bastard!
Why aren't you helping?</i>
<i>Feel sorry for him, do you?</i>
<i>You want to forgive him?</i>
<i>Hanaya wants to say something.</i>
<i>- Bastard!
- I'm sorry.</i>
<i>Truly sorry.
So truly sorry.</i>
<i>And that makes everything all right?</i>
Let him speak.
Soon they'll have you on the rack
with chili water up your nose.
Scared?
Get a grip on yourself.
What are you scared of?
Everyone's here.
A chopped-off head leaves a big scar.
Blame it all on me.
You can say l captured the Jap.
If we were scared,
would we be here?
We're just hanging around.
Why can't we talk?
I thought everything was fine
until your donkey started acting up.
He's got no sense of timing.
He could have chosen
another horse besides the Jap's.
<i>Please forgive me.</i>
<i>Please forgive me.</i>
<i>Please forgive me. I'm so sorry.</i>
<i>Hanaya,
let me read this letter to you.</i>
<i>Yes, sir.</i>
<i>"The son of the Hanayas
is a great hero.</i>
<i>Each time I pass by their door,
I lower my head in shame.</i>
<i>Hanaya is the pride of our village.</i>
<i>Son. Kill more Chinese pigs
for your father.</i>
<i>Serve the emperor well
Solemnly yours - ”</i>
San. You kept Hanaya
locked up for six months.
Couldn't they do the same to us?
Why do you always think the worst?
You call that locked up?
I call it looking after them.
Besides, we didn't capture him.
He wasn't our prisoner.
But now we're locked up here
with nothing to eat or drink.
So aren't we the prisoners now?
Prisoners?
Don't you have two legs?
You came here yourself.
If you're a prisoner,
you're your own prisoner.
Dad.
How can you sleep?
- This is no good. Move.
- San.
I've got something to say
to your captain-san.
<i>Get back!</i>
- I've got something to say-
- Get back!
<i>- I've got -
- Get back!</i>
- But I must talk to him.
- Get back!
<i>Move again and I'll kill you.</i>
Then <i>...</i>
Kosaburo Hanaya.
<i>"0n August 15, 1945,</i>
<i>Zixuan Zhao, Dasan Ma,</i>
<i>Kosaburo Hanaya, Hanchen Dong
solemnly agreed to these terms.”</i>
<i>- Hanaya.
- Yes, sir.</i>
<i>You groveled enough.
Why not mention this as well?</i>
<i>I was about to.</i>
<i>- Bastard
- Shut up.</i>
<i>Captain,
you don't have to honor the agreement.</i>
<i>Shut up! Fool!</i>
<i>Hanaya left his fingerprint.</i>
<i>Unlike the Chinese,
the Japanese are honorable people.</i>
<i>Get out!</i>
<i>Yes, sir.</i>
<i>- I humbly take my leave.
- Get out.</i>
<i>- Hanaya.
- Yes, sir.</i>
<i>You've signed an agreement.</i>
<i>The Imperial Army honors
its pledges.</i>
<i>I have no choice
but to carry this through.</i>
<i>Hold on. In my experience,
the Chinese are unreliable mongrels.</i>
<i>If they say east, think west.</i>
<i>I'm sure it's not as simple as it seems.
There must be someone behind this.</i>
<i>Shut up. Bastard.</i>
<i>Hanaya. Stand up.</i>
<i>This matter...</i>
<i>I'll do this for you.</i>
<i>All right?</i>
<i>Yes, sir.</i>
<i>Attention!</i>
<i>Who signed this agreement?</i>
<i>What, afraid to admit you signed?</i>
I signed.
<i>Good. Come here.</i>
<i>Dasan Ma.</i>
<i>Dasan Ma.</i>
Good
Here, come.
San.

<i>Lieutenant Nonomura.</i>
<i>What is it, Inoue?</i>
<i>Phone call</i>
<i>Urgent phone call</i>
<i>From Western Fortress Town.</i>
<i>They haven't called in
over a month.</i>
<i>They must have a mission for us.</i>
<i>Charge!</i>
<i>- Follow me!
- Onwards!</i>
Is that Old Uncle?
Old Uncle here.
It's me, Dasan.
- Is that San?
- Yeah.
What's up?
The grain will be there tonight.
It'll arrive by dusk.
- What?
- Get everyone together.
Everyone must be there.
Do you understand me?
- What?
- Can you hear me?
Huh? What?
I said, do you understand me?
I hear you.
I hear you.
Gather everyone together.
- Right?
- Right.
San.
- Have a safe journey.
- I will.
Take care.
Yeah.
I'm finished.
<i>Yes, we know.</i>
<i>Captain.
Lieutenant Nonomura would like a word.</i>
<i>Hello?</i>
<i>Yes, organize a celebration
with the navy and infantry.</i>
He's so far away. But he sounded like
he was in the next room.
Wasn't that amazing?
It's no wonder...
What are you talking about?
<i>He says the captain is
the kindest of men</i>
<i>and the Imperial Army has
the finest of things.</i>
<i>Hanaya stayed with you
for six months.</i>
<i>He consumed much food
and put you out.</i>
<i>So,</i>
<i>I will give you
the two carts of grain</i>
<i>and add four carts as as reward
Six in all. How's that? Translate.</i>
The captain said,
because of  the grain eaten by Hanaya,
he will add four carts as a reward.
Six in all. How's that?
- Six carts of grain?
- Thank the captain-san.
I'm speechless.
<i>What's he saying?</i>
<i>His gratitude knows no bounds.
He wishes to kowtow before you.</i>
<i>All right. Load the carts.
Get their people together. Hurry up.</i>
Quickly, load the carts,
before the Japs change their mind.
- Load the carts? Great.
- Come back.
- You've got to bow to the Captain-san.
- Captain-san.
- Well, San?
- What happened?
You're going on the rack
with chili water up your nose.
They've given us the two carts
plus four more. Six in all.
That's wonderful!
Let's load 'em up.
You can slap me if you like.
<i>Go right, Captain.</i>
Can you take this for me?
I want to pick up Yu'er
and collect a few others as well.
Won't the old man get angry?
Don't tell him. Let him brood.
Forget him.
Okay.
<i>Long live the emperor!</i>
<i>Company, attention!</i>
<i>- Nonomura at your service.
- Sakatsuka at yours.</i>
Old Uncle!
We're back!
<i>Right turn!</i>
We've got the grain!
Happy New Year,
brother and sister-in-law.
You're my granddad,
I'm your son.
Where's my stool?
Rabbit-fucker.
Eat up.
We walk the straight
and narrow path.
A healthy foot doesn't fear
a twisted shoe.
Eat, drink and be merry.
<i>Lieutenant Nonomura,
strike up the band</i>
<i>I want to say a few words.
Can they play the army theme?</i>
<i>Oh, dear. I'm sorry.
The naval tune is the only one we know.</i>
<i>We're just naval reserves, you see.</i>
<i>Music is our little hobby</i>
<i>Then play your navy song.</i>
<i>You don't mind?</i>
<i>Attention!</i>
<i>Straighten up, Horie.</i>
<i>- Well?

The captain praises your singing.
Your mother's a real tease.
If there are more songs like this,
there'll be trouble.
Pity they're all sung in chorus.
We sing ours individually.
Why don't you sing one yourself,
to entertain us?
<i>All right.</i>
<i>Kosaburo Hanaya,
give these people a song.</i>
<i>Hanaya, stand up.</i>
<i>Were you speaking Chinese just now?
Let's hear it.</i>
Happy New Year,
brother and sister-in-law.
<i>And;</i>
You're my granddad,
I'm your son.
<i>Translate, Dong.</i>
<i>Happy New Year,
brother and sister-in-law.</i>
<i>You're my granddad
I'm your son.</i>
<i>Give me a gun.</i>
<i>Kosaburo Hanaya
is the scum of the Imperial Army.</i>
<i>I invite you to shoot him</i>
<i>with this gun</i>
<i>for our drinking entertainment.</i>
<i>Well? Who'll do it?</i>
Hanaya represents the scum of the army.
The captain invites you to shoot him.
For our drinking entertainment.
Any takers?
<i>How can he be scum?</i>
<i>For six months you lived
under Nonomura's blockhouse.</i>
<i>Is that true?</i>
<i>It's no small amount of time.</i>
<i>Why didn 't you contact Nonomura?</i>
<i>If he was on the hill,
don't tell me he couldn't see you.</i>
<i>We had no opportunity.</i>
<i>What do you mean?</i>
<i>- We were locked up in the cellar.
- I didn't ask you.</i>
<i>Hanchen Dong spoke the truth.</i>
<i>What?</i>
<i>You didn't do too badly.</i>
<i>So,</i>
<i>besides learning some Chinese,
what else did you do?</i>
<i>It's only on account of your promise
that I'm feeding these mongrels.</i>
<i>So that explains it.</i>
<i>So, asking them to kill you now</i>
<i>is rather appropriate, isn't it?</i>
<i>Come on.
Execute him, why don't you?</i>
Come on, everyone, shoot him.
<i>If you don't,</i>
<i>then I take it you forgive him?</i>
If you don't,
that means you forgive him.
Turtle-fucker!
<i>Nonomura. A favor.</i>
<i>Can we hear the whole tune
from the top?</i>
<i>Yes, sir.</i>
<i>This is our first visit here.</i>
<i>We'd never heard of Rack-Armor Terrace.
It means “put down weapons.”</i>
<i>The story goes, a long time ago,</i>
<i>a famous general retired from battle
and came here to live an ordinary life.</i>
<i>The Chinese say to "rack one's armor”</i>
<i>and return to the fields</i>
<i>is an extreme form of virtue.</i>
<i>I wish to express my deep respect.</i>
<i>Although the Japanese Army
is fighting in China,</i>
<i>this won't go on forever.</i>
<i>One day l too will rack my armor.</i>
<i>And yet,</i>
<i>in a place that so dislikes warfare,</i>
<i>a Japanese soldier
of the likes of Hanaya</i>
<i>was kidnapped and held captive.</i>
<i>It appears Rack-Armor Terrace</i>
<i>doesn't deserve its name.</i>
<i>And you are not
as wise as your forefathers.</i>
<i>I've given you your grain.</i>
<i>I've fulfilled my end of the bargain.</i>
<i>But I have a question for you.</i>
<i>Who was it
who brought this scum here?</i>
I don't know.
You have to ask Hanaya.
<i>- Hanaya, answer the question.
- I really don't know.</i>
Look. Even he doesn't know.
How could I answer?
Why not drop it?
He's been returned.
Isn't that the end of it?
<i>Well, where's Dasan Ma gone?</i>
To fetch Yu'er.
<i>Yu'er?
How many men is she bringing?</i>
<i>How many guns?</i>
She's pregnant.
She's staying at her mother's.
As for people, probably two or three.
But no guns.
They'll be back soon. We're waiting
for him to divide the grain.
<i>Divide the grain? Surely not.</i>
<i>He's gone to get the men</i>
<i>who captured Hanaya.</i>
It looks like he's scared you.
Don't be afraid.
He'll be back soon. You'll see.
<i>You think I'm afraid?</i>
Course you are.
You've got your guns out.
If that's not fear, what is it?
Look at me.
I'm eating and drinking.
I'm not worried about anything.
Just relax.
<i>Bastard!</i>
Why all the cursing?
I understand <i>bakayaro.</i>
How can you say that?
You fucking...
Liu Wang!
<i>Don't let anyone get away.</i>
<i>Don't stop. Keep playing.</i>
<i>Bastards! Surround them!</i>
Don't! Don't go!
Mongrel.
We should've killed you long ago.
You've got the heart of a wolf.
<i>- Translate.
- We could've killed you long ago.</i>
<i>New soldiers.</i>
<i>- A rare opportunity.
- Yes, sir.</i>
<i>Pull it out yourself</i>
<i>Harder. Twist it.</i>
<i>Who was it who brought
this scum here?</i>
<i>Where's Dasan Ma?</i>
The baby's nearly due.
We'll get another share of the grain,
and I'll marry you.
Turtle-fucker!
I'll kill you, Jap turtle-fucker!
Ma!
<i>Get up. Stand up.</i>
<i>Japanese inside the Great Wall.</i>
<i>Let go. Go away.</i>
<i>Nonomura.
You've been with them for too long.</i>
<i>You're getting too close to them...</i>
<i>like an auntie to these brats.</i>
<i>- Brat!
- Japanese inside the Great Wall.</i>
<i>Grab him!</i>
<i>You bastard!</i>
<i>Drag the old bastard over!</i>
I'll throttle you, turtle-fucker!
<i>Let go, you old swine!</i>
<i>You'd dare strangle
an Imperial Army soldier?</i>
<i>Hold him!</i>
<i>How come it's not cutting through?
Let me try.</i>
<i>Stop dicking around! Bastard!</i>
<i>Let me do it. Move.</i>
<i>Throw him on the fire.</i>
<i>Die, you old mongrel!</i>
Ma!
<i>Swine.
You wanna die? I'll help you.</i>
<i>Hurry! Come on!</i>
<i>Throw him in! Hurry!
You haven't seen me rest, have you?</i>
<i>L etk burn the grain and the vi//age.'</i>
<i>Charge! Advance!</i>
<i>Long live the emperor!</i>
<i>No need for you to die.</i>
<i>The emperor has made a proclamation.</i>
<i>The Imperial Army</i>
<i>has racked its armor.</i>
<i>But we weren't defeated
on the battlefield.</i>
<i>Such a pity.
On account of this imperial order,</i>
<i>we have to stop fighting.</i>
<i>The war situation is no longer</i>
<i>to Japan's advantage.</i>
<i>The enemy has employed
a new, cruel bomb</i>
<i>which has taken
a toll of many innocent lives</i>
<i>and has an incalculable
destructive power.</i>
<i>Should we continue to fight,</i>
<i>not only would the Japanese nation
be obliterated,</i>
<i>but human civilization
would be extinguished.</i>
<i>Such being the case,</i>
<i>how are we to save our subjects</i>
<i>and atone before the spirits

<i>This is why we accepted</i>

The Japanese have surrendered.
The war is over.
Peace has come at last.
Yet in the last few days,
one man has violated the agreement
which Generalissimo Chiang,
President Truman,
Prime Minister Churchill and Stalin,
in the interest of world peace,
signed at Potsdam,
thus disturbing the social order
and terrorizing people.
That person is Dasan Ma,
who you see before you.
Perhaps some will say
Dasan Ma only killed "Jap devils"
and call it “resistance.”
But what is “resistance”?
Battles fought with Japanese troops,
the struggle against invasion.
Those are acts of resistance.
But Dasan Ma's wanton slaughter of POWs
who had lost the will to resist
was a false resistance.
Perhaps some will argue
that such profound hatred
was the result of Japanese atrocities.
Who of our 400 million compatriots
doesn't hate the Japanese?
My own parents
were killed by Japanese bombs.
My left leg
was shattered in the final battle.
Who could be more motivated to kill
former Japanese soldiers?
Who has the best reason for revenge?
Me. Major Gao.
And who is most constrained
from such action?
Me. Major Gao.
Because I am a soldier,
I must follow orders.
I take this opportunity
to reissue this warning:
Only Nationalist soldiers
can legally accept the surrender
of Japanese troops.
War hasn't only brought
catastrophe to China,
but to the people of Japan as well.
Are they not human too?
I ask you.
Who among you
would tolerate
to see your husband's head chopped off?
Anyone?
No one!
I ask you too.
Who among you
would wish to see your wife,
on her way to buy a bolt of cloth,
have her hand cut off?
Anyone?
No one!
Dasan Ma. Do you have
anything to say for yourself?
Is there anything you can say?
Gag him.
Listen, everyone.
Ever heard a “cry to heaven"?
- He is braying like a mule.
- That's a “cry to heaven."
What distinguishes man from a beast?
You don't deserve
to be called Chinese.
You don't even deserve
to be called human.
How can a Chinese soldier sully
his hands with the blood of such scum?
Inokichi Sakatsuka.
<i>Inokichi Sakatsuka.</i>
<i>Attention!</i>
Inokichi Sakatsuka.
I order you
to execute Dasan Ma.
Shoot him.
<i>He orders you to carry out
the execution.</i>
<i>Really?</i>
<i>That's what he said.</i>
What?
Do you dare disobey my command?
<i>We've put down our weapons.
We cannot use firearms.</i>
<i>I could obey your order,
using a Japanese sword.</i>
<i>It's our customary weapon.</i>
<i>Translate that bit
about the sword accurately.</i>
Reporting to Major Gao:
We've already handed in our firearms.
We're not permitted
to use them anyway.
However,
we must obey your order.
Could he use a sword?
What a pain.
Okay, give him a sword.
- What a good story this is.
- Indeed.
We'll write a great skit about this.
<i>Kosaburo Hanaya.</i>
<i>Hanaya.</i>

The preparations are complete.
