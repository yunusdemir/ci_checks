but, uh, the objects brought you here.

Ray Cory's group in NeW York
and Parchman's group in CIeveIand
WiII act as support if necessary.
I understand Dr. Ruber
knoWs Joe MiIIer personaIIy,
Which is Why the job is yours.
I don't think Dr. Ruber is in any kind
of shape to heIp us,
considering his
faIIing out With MiIIer.
That's exactIy Why MiIIer WiII taIk to me.
He'd Iike to kiII me.
There's no such things as ghosts.
Fine. I'm just asking you.

They're caIIed The Order

They Want to use them.
Do you have any idea
hoW poWerfuI the objects reaIIy are?
The Order thinks that if they can
get aII the objects back together,
they can taIk to God.
That's insane.
Come With me to The Order.
Give us the key.
If anybody can bring Anna back,
We can, together.
Some day, Ruber,

Some day you're gonna need me, Joe.

I don't knoW.
But Anna may be trapped in the same pIace.
We need to find out Who she is.
- You sure you knoW Where you're going?

Doesn't seem Iike
much of a shortcut.
PIease, don't compIain to me noW.
- Hey, What's the name of this toWn?
- I don't remember.
Nobody goes there anymore.
Why not?
You knoW, the questions

I don't knoW the name of the toWn, okay?
It doesn't matter.
What it Was a Iong a time ago,
I don't knoW--
- You're trespassing'.
- Sorry.
Look, We didn't knoW anybody Iived here.
We're just headed into the toWn.
There ain't a toWn anymore.

See Why I don't Iike this pIace?
ReIax, okay?
Anything eIse?
Yeah, I'd Iike to knoW
about that moteI.
What's the matter?
I can't ask a simpIe question?
What happened at that moteI?
MoteI's haunted.
What do you mean, haunted?
There's these peopIe out of noWhere
coming doWn over the hiII,
thinking they're in--
heII.
It used to hardIy
happen at aII.
NoW it happens aII the time.
AII right, What about
the Woman at the moteI?
The Woman?
The ghost?
Who's seen her?
Nobody, huh?
I'II take the rest to the booth.
I knoW I'm not haIIucinating,
but I feeI Iike I'm Iosin' it.
You're Iosing it?
You see these peopIe?
They're Iiving a miIe and a haIf from that moteI.
It's making 'em haIf-crazy,
and they don't even knoW Why.
Most peopIe Ieft a WhiIe ago, but...
a Iot of 'em never figured out--
What?
There's our ghost.
Hi.
You Wanna come in?
Oh, I don't think so.
Better?
Much.
I'm gonna ask you a question.
Do you recognize her?
No.
Who is she?
She's a Woman I saW at the moteI.
The actuaI moteI in room number 9.
What's Wrong?
Joe, don't go back there.
- You kneW about it?
- You WouIdn't understand.
What WouIdn't I understand, Jennifer?
That's the guy from the hospice, isn't it?
He's my brother.
DreW.
We aII have reasons
to get rid of the objects.
DreW's my reason.
He became obsessed With Room 9.
And Whatever happened to him in there
destroyed him.
So, Joe, you promise me
you Won't go back there.
I am sorry about your brother.
I reaIIy am.
But I have to go back because
Whatever's happening to that Woman
couId be happening to Anna right noW.
So I'm gonna find out the names
of everyone in this picture,
and hopefuIIy I can
taIk to one of them.
Because if I can
bring that Woman back,
I can bring Anna back.
I knoW it.
My brother's research on Room 9.
WoW.
Yeah.
Home sWeet home.
Jennifer, I--
You aII right?
Yeah.
Just don't break my heart.
Don't break mine.
Jennifer, get dressed.
We have to go.
What's going on?
Get everything
It's stiII here.
Whoever made that print
Was here in 1961 .
I think my brother identified
the peopIe in this photo.
They're the CoIIectors.
The Woman you saW Was
the moteI manager in 1966.
ArIene Conroy.
ArIene Conroy.
Woman in the picture, right?
Yeah.
What happened to the rest of them?
Everyone eIse is dead.
We need to find out
Who this beIongs to.
Somebody in there?
Yeah, just Workin' Iate.
Who's in there?
Pendegrass?
Yeah, buddy?
I've seen this guy.
I'II be damned.
Who the heII's in there?
Come on.
Who the heII are you?
Get outta my house!
Gus Jacobs, I Wanna knoW
about ArIene Conroy.
I've seen her.
At the moteI.
PIease, teII me What happened.
I don't knoW.
I don't knoW.
I Wish to God
I couId heIp her.
She's my Wife.
My daughter disappeared
inside that moteI room,
same as your Wife.
She's onIy eight years oId.
Oh, God.
I'm sorry.
PIease, heIp me.
TeII me What happened in Room 9.
Do you knoW hoW the objects Were created?
Were you and ArIene invoIved somehoW?
No.
God, no.
HoW couId We?
We just ran the moteI, that's aII.
ArIene managed it,
I Was the janitor.
It Was just a reguIar pIace.
It's not Iike something happened.
It's Iike afterward,
We figured something must've happened.
The moteI onIy has
nine rooms, right?
Except, one day ArIene finds
the key to Room 10.
We tried the key and...
WeII, I suppose you knoW What We saW.
There Were stiII a feW objects inside.
I didn't Want any of it.
But ArIene got this Iook in her eye.
She Wanted to get aII the objects back.
She got some of our friends invoIved.
Pretty soon,
We Were this group.
The CoIIectors.
By '66, We had found aImost aII the objects.
And since there Wasn't a Room 10,
ArIene started experimenting in Room 9.
And finaIIy she found the Watch box.
And that's When everything Went Wrong.
What do you mean ''Went Wrong''?
It's easier if I shoW you.
This is a copy.
The originaI Was stoIen years ago.
She Iooks the same.
God, she Iooks exactIy the same.
ArIene had been Iooking for
the five objects for years.
She said With
the right combination,
she couId open the door the right Way.
I think she Was insane by then.
Then I gave her the Watch box.
And everything Went bad.
She opened the door, and it Was Iike...
Iike she opened a tear in reaIity.
What the heII is happening?
Gus, Was this fiIm spIiced together?
No.
It's one continuous piece of fiIm.
ArIene sacrificed herseIf to end it.
I saW ArIene a feW months Iater,
at the moteI.
Just for a feW seconds.
She begged me to heIp her.
I couIdn't.
I didn't knoW hoW.
I got rid of the key, and...
I never Went back.
I changed names, traveIed aII over.
EventuaIIy, I came back.
I guess I just Want be near her.
Gus, What does the box do?
May I take this fiIm?
Take it.
I never Wanna Watch it again.
And if you do find my Wife,
pIease put her out of her misery.
You're not gonna beIieve this, Detective.
We had a break-in Iast night.
Shut up.
Someone came in just to use
the fingerprint database.
They Iogged in under Joe MiIIer.
Why does Joe stiII have a Iogin?
WeII, We got a Iot on our pIate, Detective.
What Was he Iookin' for?
Okay. Looks Iike Joe MiIIer's
headed to NeW Mexico.
I think this must be the box.
WeII, if the key brings
Conroy back partIy,
maybe With the box,
she'II come back aII the Way.
I don't knoW.
Something's missing.
HoW do I get the box?
If you do this,
I'm going in With you.
There's Woman.
She's an object tracker.
She Won't deaI With the Legion,
but she might deaI With you.
Her name's Suzie Kang.
Who Was it referred you again?
I just heard your name around, that's aII.
You Work for the Legion?
- No.
- Good.
A bunch of scumbags.
AIWays trying to hide
the objects from everybody.
It's bad for business.
But they'II get theirs.
I'm on my oWn.
I have the key.
You're the neW moteI man.
- Joe MiIIer.
- Yeah. Whatever.
- Can I see the key?
- Can I point my gun at you?
I just Wanna see the key.
Oh, damn!
AII right, Mister Guy,
What are you Iookin' for?
The box.
Oh, WeII, that is totaIIy ungettabIe.
Where is it?
You knoW, I feeI bad for you
because you're stupid.
Thousand bucks.
The Watch box.
''Dampens entropy
for Iimited radius.''
I must've been
absent that day.
It prevents things
from decaying.
Who has it?
They caII themseIves The Order.
Very, very nasty cabaI.
Box Was their first object.
They base the WhoIe reIigion around it.
Thank you.
I guess if you Were
gonna shoot me--
Shut up and Iisten.
The Order has an object that
I need, the Watch box.
- Where do they keep it?
- I don't knoW.
Don't Iie to me, Ruber.
You'II never get near it, Joe.
Then cIose your eyes.
Listen to me, Joe.
You can't get the box, but I can.
- I'II get the box for you.
- Sit doWn.
Joe...
I Want to see the moteI room again.
I Wanna go inside.
Why?
Because When I saW that room,
I kneW that there Was something
in that room that I Was meant to see.
I don't knoW Why, Joe,
but I need to see it.
I need to get inside that room.
The onIy reason that you're aIive
is because I need that box.
You get the box,
you get inside the room.
If I make it out of there in one piece,
I promise I WiII find a Way to Wake you up.
Oh, my God, DreW.
The comb.
I Wanted to Iet you knoW I think I found
a Way to bring your Wife back.
AII you'II bring her is pain.
Just Iet it go, son.
I'm sorry, I have to give it a try.
Excuse me.
- MiIIer.
- Joe, Iisten.
The Iast object my brother
Was missing Was the comb.
I got it back from the Legion.
I'II be right there.
I have to go.
Joe...
ArIene didn't disappear
the same Way your daughter did.
ArIene had the key.
It Was the objects that ate her.
It Was the objects.

murder of Detective Lou Destefano

Doesn't matter.

Yeah?
If I'm right, he's the prime object.
And We're gonna find him.
