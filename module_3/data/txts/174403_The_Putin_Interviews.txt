Oh, man.
So, uh, as to, uh...
We're gonna sit here, Mr. Putin.
I'm gonna sit here.
I will come around,
and we can meet here.
We'll meet about here.
Descend from the balcony.
‐I like it better from there...
‐Okay.
'Cause it gives you some depth.
In fact, there's a bar
back there if you'd like.
No, further back, further back.
Okay.
All right, ready?
Now pretend like
we don't know each other.
And we're‐‐ Pretend we haven't
seen each other in months.
Okay. And action.
Action.
Tell him "action" in Russian.
Okay.
Where's my AD? Come on.
Action!
He went into another meeting.
Oh, there he is.
Oh, that's very kind of you.
Here.
Thank you, Mr. President.
How have you been?
It's been a long time.
‐Sugar. ‐Sugar?
Without sugar here.
Uh, it's been quite
a lot of activity
the last few months.
My country, uh,
America has had an election.
Donald Trump won.
This...
This is your fourth president.
Am I right?
Your fourth president.
<i>Mr. Clinton...</i>
<i>Mr. Bush...</i>
<i>Mr. Obama, and now,</i>
the fourth one.
What changes?
Is that your feeling, in between
all the four presidents?
Yeah.
Is there any possibility,
a hope of change
with Mr. Trump?
Wow. That's very Russian.
Very Dostoyevsky.
<i>Vladimir Putin himself</i>
<i>directed the covert
cyberattacks.</i>
<i>This is not just an attack
against me and my campaign,</i>
<i>this is an attack
against our country.</i>
US intelligence believes
that the cyberattack
on the e‐mail of the
Democratic National Committee
<i>was ordered by the Russian
president himself, Vladimir Putin.</i>
In early September, when I saw
when I saw President
Putin in China,
I felt that
the most effective way
to ensure that
that didn't happen...
was to talk to him directly.
And tell him to cut it out,
and there were gonna be
some serious consequences
if he didn't.
The election has been
heavily criticized.
And the narrative
as written by the West
has now become that Russia
interfered in this election,
to the benefit of Mr. Trump.
Yes. So why, why did you bother
to hack the election then?
Sadly...
the American Dream...
is dead.
Donald J. Trump is calling
or a total and complete shutdown
of Muslims entering
the United States,
until our country's
representatives
can figure out
what the hell is going on.
Build that wall!
Build that wall!
But, you know,
even Trump has said
the Russians hacked
the election. That was a quote.
As far as hacking,
I think it was Russia,
but I think we also get hacked
by other countries
and other people.
If Putin likes Donald Trump,
guess what folks?
That's called an asset,
not a liability.
Now, I don't know
that I'm gonna get along
with Vladimir Putin.
I hope I do, but there's
a good chance I won't.
And if I don't,
do you honestly believe
that Hillary would be tougher
on Putin than me?
Does anybody in this room
really believe that?
Well, this all seems to me
still historically enormous.
I've never seen where
the two leading parties,
the intelligence agencies,
and, uh, the political
leadership of NATO
believe this story that
Russia hacked the election.
It's enormous. I mean...
Have you read
the 25‐page report?
<i>It details Russian cyberattacks</i>
<i>against not just the
Democratic National Committee,</i>
<i>but the White House</i>
<i>the Joint Chiefs of Staff,</i>
<i>the State Department,</i>
<i>even American companies.</i>
<i>Some hacks, successful.</i>
<i>Others, thwarted.</i>
And, uh, it seems, Senator McCain
for example, today or yesterday,
was proposing a veto,
a Senate veto,
of any lifting of sanctions
from Trump, in advance.
<i>Putin is a killer.</i>
There is no moral equivalence
between the United States
and Putin's Russia.
I repeat, there is
no moral equivalent
between that butcher
and thug and KGB colonel
and the United States
of America, the country...
that Ronald Reagan used to
call a shining city on a hill.
"Carthage must be destroyed."
Russia has been accused
of enormous treachery now.
This is a major charge.
The media repeats it
and repeats it,
and it seems to have entered into
the lexicon in the United States.
It's just taken for granted.
You can say Russia hacked
the election,
and many people say
Trump is, uh,
in the Kremlin's pocket,
has a debt to the Kremlin.
So you, you see
where this leads to.
It makes a situation impossible,
very difficult for Mr. Trump,
if indeed he intends
to correct relations,
to reset relations.
Many people are frustrated,
who agree
that this hacking charge
is fraudulent.
Many people agree
with Julian Assange,
<i>who has a pretty solid record
going back to 2006.</i>
We can say, um,
we have said, repeatedly,
uh, over the last two months,
uh, that our source, uh,
is not the Russian government,
uh, and it is not state party.
Well, it seems to me that if you
know their tricks, you could make
some kind of statement
about cyberwarfare
and give specifics
of why this was not possible,
and why there
should have been a trace.
I mean, there's many different
avenues you can explore.
It seems as if
Russia doesn't care
about defending itself
to these accusations.
They're letting them fly by
and saying business as usual.
Well, is there any evidence,
uh, in cyberspace
that Russia can present
in its defense?
So, right now,
he's waiting it out.
At the same time, you know, Mr. Trump
has called, on more than one occasion,
for another massive US military buildup
in both nuclear and conventional,
<i>which makes no sense to me.</i>
<i>I mean, how can America spend
more than it's already spending?</i>
Do you have any hopes
of a meeting, uh,
sometime in the coming months
with Mr. Trump?
But how is he going to work with the intelligence
agencies if the intelligence agencies
are telling him that
Russia hacked the election?
It's a dead end.
If, uh, Mr. Trump called for...
wanted to declassify
or see the files on Ukraine,
all the files,
all the files on Syria,
and see the origins
of these problems,
is there a possibility of that,
that he might change
some of his thinking?
When is the next G20 meeting?
So that, theoretically, would be the first
time they'd ever see each other if they did?
I gather you've had
two phone calls with him?
And I gather, uh...
some of the talk may
have been about terrorism?
Right. Right. I understand.
Uh... was there US interference
in the 2012 election in Russia?
We have programs both inside
Russia and outside Russia.
To work with those
Russian activists
who want to work with us, to
try to strengthen rule of law,
to try to strengthen
a free press.
We have a large number
of Russian journalists
who've actually fled this,
uh, fled Russia now,
who are working with us
and with others in Europe,
to try to ensure there is,
um, independent
Russian language news,
uh, inside‐‐ going back
into the country.
We also work on lege‐‐
uh, LGBT rights
and other things inside Russia
with those who want
to work with us.
Yes. Was there cyberinterference
in the 2012 election?
Let's clarify it, 'cause
cyberwarfare is here with us.
We've started down that
road a few years ago.
We have entered into
a new phase of conflict,
in which we use a cyberweapon
to create physical destruction.
In the movie I did, <i>Snowden,</i>
there's a scene‐‐
and Snowden, uh,
told me this story‐‐
<i>he's in Japan.</i>
<i>NSA wanted to impress
the Japanese,</i>
<i>show them our reach.</i>
<i>They were not as thrilled
to learn that we wanted them</i>
<i>to help us spy
on the Japanese population.</i>
<i>They said it was
against their laws.</i>
<i>Of course, we tapped
the entire country anyway.</i>
<i>And we didn't stop there,</i>
<i>'cause once we owned
their communications system,</i>
<i>we started going after
the physical infrastructure.</i>
<i>We'd slip these little sleeper
programs into power grids, dams,</i>
<i>hospitals, and the idea was,
if the day came</i>
<i>when Japan was
no longer an ally,</i>
<i>it'd be lights out.</i>
<i>And it wasn't just the Japanese.</i>
<i>We were planting malware
in Mexico, Germany,</i>
<i>Brazil, Austria.</i>
<i>I mean, China I can understand,</i>
<i>or Russia or Iran,</i>
<i>Venezuela, okay, but...</i>
<i>- ‐Austria?</i>
- ‐
<i>You're also being ordered
to follow most world leaders</i>
<i>and heads of industry.</i>
<i>You know,
you're tracking trade deals,</i>
<i>sex scandals, diplomatic cables</i>
<i>to give the US an advantage
in negotiations at the G8</i>
<i>or leverage
over Brazilian oil companies,</i>
<i>or helping to oust
some third world leader</i>
<i>who's not playing ball.</i>
<i>And ultimately,
the truth sinks in</i>
<i>that no matter what justification
you're selling yourself,</i>
<i>this is not about terrorism.</i>
<i>Terrorism is the excuse.</i>
<i>This is about economic
and social control.</i>
<i>And the only thing
you're really protecting</i>
<i>is the supremacy
of your government.</i>
If I'm saying that they're planting
malware in Japanese infrastructure
to destroy
power stations, railroads,
close the country down,
black it out‐‐
the Russians are
miles ahead of me.
They must realize
the dangers here,
and they must've been working
on them for some time,
uh, to prevent such a situation
from happening to Russia,
'cause that would do
the obvious,
one of the obvious enemies
of the United States.
Yeah. I buy that.
Yeah.
Okay. Well, we're talking‐‐ I mean,
in real time, we're talking like,
if Snowden is saying
the US is doing this
to an ally in 2007,
with Japan, 2008,
if they're planting malware in allies‐‐
do you understand what I'm saying?
What are they doing with their‐‐
people like China,
Russia, Iran, and so forth?
I mean, you understand my point
is that Russia had to be aware
as early as 2007 that the US
<i>was planting malware.</i>
<i>The United States
will not admit it,</i>
<i>but it's known that in 2010,</i>
<i>we succeeded in planting
the Stuxnet virus in Iran.</i>
<i>By the fall of 2010,</i>
<i>the consensus was that Iran's top
secret uranium enrichment plant</i>
<i>at Natanz was the target,
and that Stuxnet</i>
<i>was a carefully constructed weapon,
designed to be carried into the plant</i>
<i>on a corrupted laptop
or thumb drive,</i>
<i>then infect the system,
disguise its presence,</i>
<i>move through the network
changing computer code,</i>
<i>and subtly alter
the speed of the centrifuges</i>
<i>without the Iranians
ever noticing.</i>
<i>Sabotage by software.</i>
Were there attacks on Russia
as early as 2007, '06, '05?
Yeah, yeah.
As late as what year?
As late as...
Okay.
Yes.
And then what happened?
I mean, when did Russia
build up its cybercapabilities?
I would imagine Russia
is having an ongoing battle
with the United States,
secret battle,
with cyberwarfare.
I would imagine United States is
trying to do things to Russia,
and Russia was trying to defend itself,
and do things to the United States.
Okay.
Well, he's, he's acting funny
about this story.
Like he's guilty a bit.
You look like a fox who just
got out of the henhouse.
- A few weeks ago on <i>RT,</i>
- I saw a report.
It was not followed up on, it
disappeared after a day or two,
but in that report,
20 plus countries
were reported as being part
of a botnet attack
on the banking system
in Russia, six major banks.
This seems to be of such a magnitude that
it was‐‐ this was after the election.
It points to a possible US attack
on Russia's banking system.
It's a gigantic piece
of business.
I mean, you have Mr. Biden,
first of all, who says,
we will attack Russia
in the same manner
as they attacked us
in this election.
We're sending a message.
We have the capacity to do it
and he'll know it,
and it'll be at the time
of our choosing
and under the circumstances
that have the greatest impact.
And Mr. Obama seconded that.
I think there is no doubt
that when any foreign government
tries to impact
the integrity of our elections
that... we need to take action.
And we will, at a time and place
of our own choosing.
Some of it may be, uh,
explicit, and publicized,
some of it may not be.
Um, but Mr. Putin is well aware
of my feelings about this,
because I spoke
to him directly about it.
This is outrageous conversation,
but those are big words.
They're from the vice president,
and then from the president.
They're serious people.
So something happened
before inauguration day.
Well, you're making light of it,
but in view of how much money
we have invested in cyberwarfare
and our cybercommand,
it seems like
a serious threat to me.
I have the feeling
that he's playing it down,
because something did happen,
and he doesn't want
to reveal it,
and... because
of sensitive relations.
No. I'm worried that,
you know, I would hate‐‐
I believe that cyberwarfare
can lead to a hot war.
Uh, I, I really believe that,
because of the past.
The Stuxnet virus came very close
to creating chaos in the world.
I think this is very
dangerous, very dangerous,
and I think
we're playing with fire.
I know. Well, you're obviously
sitting on some information.
I understand why you may not
want to make it public.
But are we gonna be able to
handle the capabilities of this?
It seems to me that
what happened in Iran
could be as serious in its
way as what happened in 1945
at Nagasaki and Hiroshima.
It was the beginning
of a new age.
It seems to me it's secret war,
but no one knows who started it,
no one knows if it was
a proxy country,
if it was North Korea
that hacked Sony,
that, you know,
these rumors go around.
But if all the lights go out in Russia
overnight, there'd be a tremendous fear
in Russia, as there would be
in the United States,
and people wouldn't know
who did it.
Oh!
Yeah.
A treaty.
Perhaps this is something that Mr. Trump and Mr.
Putin can really open up.
John Reed, the only American
buried in the Kremlin.
Played by Warren Beatty
in the wonderful movie <i>Reds.</i>
He wrote about the revolution.
He was here in 1917‐18.
He cared deeply about socialism
and founded the American
Communist Party.
Not that that was evil or anything,
it was quite idealistic,
'cause it was a worker's‐‐ the workers
had a lot of strikes going on in the US,
and there was a lot of opposition
from the corporations.
And he was considered a hero
<i>by many, many people.</i>
Of course,
he was against World War I,
as were many pacifists
and decent people.
And out of World War I
came the Russian Revolution,
which is an interesting comment
on the role of empires.
Now we're coming up
onto Lenin's tomb.
I visited here many years ago,
but regulations don't permit us
to go in
and photograph anything.
You know, the interesting issue
about Lenin's tomb
is the fact that, uh, next year
is the hundredth anniversary
<i>of the revolution.</i>
<i>So, this is a big event.</i>
<i>Many people revere him in all
the cities of the Soviet Union,</i>
<i>He has many, many statues.</i>
On the other hand, with the
failure of Communism in 1991
and the resulting pain
to the population,
there's also
very divided feelings about
whether to honor him on the
hundredth anniversary or not.
It's a good time
to maybe let him go,
because if indeed his karma's
in here, and he's in a grave,
I would hate‐‐ I'd hate to
think I'd have to hang around
a hundred more years
and be watched by everybody.
I think you'd get‐‐ you should
get a moment off, you know?
So that you can go off
and ingest a new karma.
When you go in, it's a very...
it's a very austere experience.
They keep it quiet. There's a guard
that's always there, uh, or two.
Uh, and, uh, you have a little,
you're not rushed
like in a lot of places,
you're rushed around a lot.
They give you time, and you,
you sit, you watch,
you listen, you think.
It's a very powerful experience.
Brezhnev.
- ‐Felix Dzerzhinsky.
- Dzerzhinsky.
‐Andropov. ‐Yuri Andropov.
The most famous, uh, villain
in history next to Adolf
according to many people,
Joseph Stalin.
To the people on the,
of the revolution
on the left, for which, uh,
Communism meant a change,
better change for the workers,
he was a disaster in the sense
<i>that he left a horrible
reputation, uh, and stained</i>
the ideology forever.
Uh... it's mixed with blood
and, and terror.
But he did play a huge role in World
War II and was a very close ally
with, uh, the US
during World War II.
Mr. Trotsky, no?
Where is he? Ask‐‐
No Trotsky, right?
Stalin, uh, managed to erase,
uh, Trotsky's memory.
He ended up being killed
in Mexico by Stalin's agents.
Let's go.
<i>- On Stalin.
- He said that, you know,</i>
he's said negative things
about Stalin,
uh, and of course, he's widely
condemned in the world.
But, at the same time, we all know that he
lead, uh, Russia to victory over Germany,
<i>over fascism.</i>
<i>And, uh, what does
he make of that,</i>
by, uh... let's say
that ambiguity?
‐ ‐Why?
He can discuss it tomorrow
if he wants.
Birthmarks.
<i>And your father and your
mother admired him, right?</i>
And when did his parents die?
<i>Were they proud of him?</i>
<i>I mean, your mother and father
couldn't believe it, right?</i>
"My president coming,"
let's see. Yeah, that's nice.
The US, uh, accusations are
essentially that
you've created a system
of centralization
authoritarianism,
what they call an
oligarchic state capitalism.
On the other hand,
they were quite pleased,
of course,
with the 1990s Russia...
where the older‐‐
where the oligarchs thrived,
and then before you came in,
and then you, you knocked out
or derailed several of them,
by your own.
You told me that story, that you
had a meeting, uh, in Moscow,
and you made the point
in this meeting that
there was a responsibility
to the people and to the state.
So, uh, the Western elite says
that you have put
your oligarchs into the power
in these last 15 years.
Whereas these old oligarchs are
sitting in places like London.
They admit that they've
accumulated great wealth...
but they say that you've
lead them to the wealth
and that you've shared in it,
that you are, in fact, the single
richest person in the world.
Not since, uh, Rockefeller,
Morgan, or Onassis or‐‐
You may laugh,
and I appreciate it.
But as a leader of your people, like, uh,
Chavez or Castro, or many other people
who've been accused
of corruption,
is there some way you could make
your personal wealth clearer?
So, there is, uh,
no bank accounts in Cyprus.
I would imagine.
Well, I have to say from
personal observation that, uh,
I would have a hell of a lot
more fun if I was rich.
If you run again in 2018
and you win,
you will be in power
another six years, till 2024.
You would have been in power
as president and prime minister
for 24 years,
longer than Roosevelt,
less than Castro,
who was close to 50 years,
and close to Stalin,
who was, give or take, 30 years.
Now, 27 years.
Does that not scare you?
Do you not get used to power?
Uh, does it distort
your point of view?
Do you feel that Russia
needs you that badly?
Can there not be
a healthy competition
among successors
inside the system?
The Chinese one‐party system
being an example,
of competition within the party.
The successors are checked out
for many years as party members
in different provinces.
Yes, that's true.
I understand that. I said "if."
If‐‐...
And of course, no matter what,
you know, um,
democracy itself, whatever
we call it, is flawed.
And America's system is,
is hardly perfect.
We know that money
buys power in America.
Certainly Russia has
a flawed system.
It is very like‐‐ unlikely that the
next election will convince the world
that, uh, this is a democracy,
a functioning democracy,
unless international monitors
were brought in,
as Mr. Chavez did in Venezuela.
And it became
a really transparent process.
That is a dangerous
argument, because, uh...
it works both ways.
Those who abuse power always say
it's a question of survival.
Mr. Putin, I don't doubt for one moment
your love and pride in serving Russia.
It is clear that you are
a son of Russia to me
and that you've done
very well by her.
But I think we all know
the price of power.
And when we're in power,
too long, no matter what,
we feel the people need us,
but at the same time,
we've changed,
and we don't even know it
sometimes, or recognize it.
Okay.
So, uh, what time is it?
Thank you, Mr. Putin.
‐Beaten? ‐Beaten. No?
Oh, yes, I've been beaten.
Oh sure. Yeah. No.
I know. But it's worth it.
It's worth it
if it brings some more peace
and consciousness to the world.
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.
Thank you. Come back.
I will.
Lovely time.
‐All the best. ‐Thank you.
Thank you. Bye‐bye.
Our American "partner."
It's their favorite word.
He's used it a thousand times.
‐Thank you, Dmitry.
‐All the best.
‐See you later. ‐Yeah. Next
time it'll be relaxing.
See you.
Thank you so much.
Good luck
with the military tonight.
Take some time off after that.
Bye‐bye.
