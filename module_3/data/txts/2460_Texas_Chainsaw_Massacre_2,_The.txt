This is Stretch.
That's for Glen.
And could you tell the girls at
Mesquite High just to leave him alone?
Got it, and I believe it.
Glen is off-limits now.
This is Stretch on an open request line
on K-OKLA in Burkburnett, Texas,
Red River Rock 'n' Roll,
from the tip-top of the
Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.
Heck, let's give Stretch a call

No, baby.
We're on the road

You're on the road to nowhere!

What? It just cut off.
Did you do that? What happened?
It's like super feedback.
Just put the underwoofer

I don't know.
Just went dead air.
- I want the license plate.
- No problem.
All right, now, ease up here.
You go get your pictures.
Watch out, Bob.
All right, keep the tension
on that line.
Hey, loosen that chain.
We need some slack.
Easy. Easy.
You, get out of there!
Three-zero.
Cowboy, get away from there.
This is an accident scene.
The area is restricted.
- Not gonna tell you...
- It's all right, Wendell.
Lieutenant Enright, sir.
We heard you might be headed this way.
Did you come over for the big game?
You know why I'm here.
Yes, sir,
something about the chainsaw killers,
your brother's kids killed.
But that was 14 years ago, sir,
way down in South Texas.
Now, these are other kids.
This is just an accident.
Just a couple of wild punks
out raising hell.
Yep.
One of those boys is so wild,
sawed his own head off
going 90 mile per hour.
Hell.
Hell's exactly what they raised.
No, sir, that information's
off the record.
You know, sir, this is always
a pretty hairy weekend for Dallas.
Whole lot of folks come to town
and don't give a damn about football.
You know, they just wanna go blood crazy
for a few and riot.
You know what "riot" means.
You were a Ranger.
I can't hardly keep them down by law,
and if...
If you go around
promoting this chainsaw...
Try to speak plain.
Saves time.
I have authority from
the DA's office
to put you right back on
the next plane to Amarillo.
Well, you just do that, son.
I'd like to see that authority.
All right, Lieutenant Enright,
what's your deal?
All right.
I'm gonna ask some questions.
Put it in the press. Get it in the news.
Any information about this accident...
...and maybe some witnesses.
Yes, sir, I...
I know some old boys at the paper.
We'll get your story out for you.
Brazos.
Brazos!
Remember the Alamo, cowboy.
I won!
Wanna fuck?
Asshole.
You need a witness? I'm a witness.
This Mercedes? I think I was talking
to those kids when it happened.
No way was that an accident.
- You saw it.
- No, but I heard it.
You can listen. It's here on tape.
Oh, shit. Come on.
Regulations.
We gotta record all the call-ins.
End of the night, we wipe the tapes,
but I kept this one just 'cause...
It just got to me.
- We got professionals working...
- I didn't know what I heard,
but I read your story.
What you're looking for
- is on this tape.
- ...so don't fool with it.
You can slow it down now.
You're just a joke
in this morning's paper.
"Cowboy chases chainsaws 14 years.
Dallas police refuse comment."
Like you're, you know,
hung up on something crazy.
But I believe you.
I might be the only believer you got.
- 'Cause it's right here.
- What is?
Right on here,
those kids getting killed.
Now, this is evidence, sort of, right?
Yeah, it's time for you to go home.
- No, wait a minute.
- Come on.
Look, I came here
because I thought I could help you.
I deejay this dumb show
on K-OKLA up in Burkburnett,
but people listen to me
all across North Texas.
Now, I could put you on the radio,
get people to believe you,
get you some help.
You're gonna get in my way.
- Don't you get in my way.
- No, I'm already right
in the middle of this.
This is my chance
to stop playing head-banging music
and do something real.
Well, I don't need anybody
to stand with me,
all right?
You can't do it alone.
I got a perfect willingness to die.
That gives me a moral
on this bunch of mad dogs.
They live on fear. They thrive on it.
I ain't got no fear left.
Adios.
I ain't got no fear, Lord.
- Hardass.
- Hardass? Me?
Well, maybe a semi-hardass,
but I got a soft heart.
Looky.
- Built you a little fry house.
- L.G.!
What, darling?
Oh, L.G.
OK, everybody, hush up.
Listen up, y'all.
The Texas-OU Chili
Cook-off champion is
- from Norman, Oklahoma? No.
- No!

Tulsa? Nope.
- Pardon me.

He's Dallas' favorite caterer,
and I think he's kind of cute.
The Last Round-up Rolling Grill chef,
Drayton Sawyer!
Drayton! Drayton!
Drayton! Drayton!
Drayton! Drayton! Drayton! Drayton!
It's the second year in a row.
This year, Drayton,
you've got to tell the secret
of that fabulously tasty chili!
No secret. It's the meat.
Don't skimp on the meat.
I got a real good eye for prime meat.
Runs in the family.
Whoop! Whoop!
It's one of those, uh,
hard-shell peppercorns.
I gotta say, I love this town.
This town loves prime meat!
So there's the big story.
Texas clobbers Oklahoma in chili.
This is Stretch, your fearless
reporter, live from Dallas.
Now, be sure to watch
your drinking and driving
on this wild and woolly
Texas-OU Weekend.
This is Stretch, on K-OKLA...
Cut-Rite.
No, C.L., I ain't seen Fletcher.
Well, last Friday.
Well, hell, he's on the road, then.
Well, don't believe me, then. Fine.
C.L...
No.
I'll be with you in just a minute, sir.
Now, you're getting
as mean as a sting bat, C.L.
No, hell, don't call back.
No, don't you call back.
I got a business here,

Come all the way up here to Burkburnett.
No shit!
Yeah.
Oh, you wanna hear it now.
I wanna hear it on the radio.
On your show.
Uh-uh.
I don't think it'd be legal to do that.
FCC regulations, those things.
Well, you just figure out
how to do it and do it.
You bend the rules. I don't know.
Huh!
- Why?
- Because the killers are here.
Kill sites have been clustered all over
Northeast Texas the last two years.
The laws, they shy away
from piecing it together as murder.
They call it accidents, disappearances.
You got that last slaughter on tape.
You play it on the radio.
Maybe then, the laws will stop trying
to shut me up and start helping me.
Besides, it'll give you
something real to do.
You said you were gonna do this alone.
I need your help, missy.
Well...
...you can call me Stretch,
Mr. Enright.
Well, now, you can call me Lefty.
It's mighty nice
doing business with you.
- Thanks.
- All right.
You have a nice day, now.

Get out of here.
Who's this? I get it.
Are you the saboteur
that's fucking up our house?
Trying to put me out of business?
Thousands of dollars lost.
You got that kind of money? No!
It's the deejay. My fave.
That dirty thing?
Told me you boys got her.
Well, yeah.
Leatherface killed her
once already tonight.
But look, she's red-faced.
Bubba's been playing with her.
Bubba likes her.
Bubba's got a girlfriend.
Bubba's got a girlfriend!
Bubba's got a girlfriend!
Bubba's got a girl...
Is that what this is, Bubba?
The old cock-and-cunt swindle, huh?
S-C-E-X. Sex.
And you had to find out about it,
didn't you?
You just couldn't leave it alone.
If you wanted to know about it so bad,
why didn't you ask me?
You wanna know about it?
You wanna know about it?
Ask me. Ask me.
It's a swindle, that's all.
So don't get mixed up in it.
Help me. Help me.
Help me.
Please, help me. Please.
Help me.
Please, help me.
All right, Miss Priss, cut that out.
Leave him alone, damn it!
Bubba, you were supposed to finish her.
Finish her now.
- Burn her like a rat.
- Finish her.
- Burn her like a rat!
- Finish her now.
Burn her like a rat!
Burn her like a rat, rat, rat!
- Burn her like a rat!
- Finish her now!
- Finish her now, Bubba!
- Burn her like a rat!
- Finish her!
- Finish her. Finish her.
Give me that.
Turn traitor for a piece of tail.
You got one choice, boy,
sex or the saw.
Sex is, well, nobody knows.
But the saw, the saw is family.
- The saw is family.
- Wait till Granddad hears about this.
Take her away.
- She's in the garbage now.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.
- A-one...
...and a-two...
...and a-three!
No!
Dinnertime, damn it! Let's go.
Eat and run. Eat and run.
There's a lot of hungry
football fans to feed.
Hurry it up. Grandpa likes to go fast.
He always did. Come on. Come on.
Time eats money.
Those damn coon shits
are the weight of the family.
I stoop my shoulders
taking care of my younger brothers.
It squashed the young years
out of my life
like a can of cheese whip.
I wouldn't wish this rotten life
off on a one-eyed ferret with mange.
You're the first girl
Bubba's brought home to dinner.
This is a real special occasion.
Grandpa sure looks forward
to meeting you.
He's 137 years old
but still as fast as Jesse James,
so don't you worry none.
Here comes Grandpa now.
God bless you, Grandpa.
It's playtime!
It's dinnertime!
Your little boys
have some left here for you.
Yes, no, yes, no!
Yes, we do!
We love you!
We love you!
OK, now. Take it easy, now.
Take it easy with Grandpa.
- That's right. That's right.
- Get him over here easy, now.
- That's right. OK.
- Come on, you boys.
Easy with Grandpa, now.
- Easy with Grandpa.
- No! No!
Oh, please, no.
Don't rattle him like that, damn it!
You're balling up his shit.
No!
Grandpa's strict liquid diet
keeps him as fresh as a rose.
Every spring,
the Atlas Rendering Company used to
throw a big barbecue for Grandpa.
He was the master.
He was the one and only.
He showed us all the business.
We was raised in meat.
But then after the glory,
here comes the shame.
Atlas went for automation.
The electrified cages,
the cold-steel chutes,
the air-powered head hammers.
That drove Grandpa crazy,
seeing things done like that.
Let me go! Let me go!
No, no, that's all right. That's all
right. It'll be over soon.
Get the hammer.
The crunching and the grinding,
he just couldn't stand it, no way.
So that was all she wrote.
One morning, Grandpa just quit going in.
It was the shame.
It was the shame. The shame.
There's more work to do.
Let's get on with it.
Right. Let's get on with it. Bingo!
Give me that.
Get that tub over there in a hurry.
Do I have to do every damn thing
around here?
You just sit tight.
Bubba, she's ready. Bring her on down.
No!
- Oh, no!
- Bring her on down, damn it!
No! No!
Bring her on down!
No! No, no, no!
No, no, no!
Help me! No, no, no!
Let me go! You gotta let me go!
Let me go! Please, help me!
- This will be one you won't forget.
- Please, help me!
It's a real honor.
Grandpa, he's a one-hitter.
And it's just like going home.
Please help me!
- No! No! No, God!
- No, no.
Help me! Let me go!
Let me go! Let me go!
Help me, please!
Please, help me!
Let's go see Grandpa, boy.
No, don't!
- No! No, God!
- Come on. Bring the bitch down.
No! No!
No, no, let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go! No! No!
No, no, no!
No!
Here come the judge.
Here come the judge.
No!
Now, don't ruin Grandpa's favorite rug.
Be careful of the splatter.
You gotta be careful of the splatter.
- Great-grandma in chainsaw heaven...
- No! No! God!
...please don't hoodoo the boy.
Hey, Grandpa, here's the big boy.
Look what Bubba brought you.
Hey, Grandpa, Bubba's got
something to show you here.
Look, a Slurpee booty.
- Hit her, Grandpa.
- Come on, Grandpa.
Let's see you do it. Now, come on.
Come on, Grandpa. You're the best.
- Hit her, Grandpa. Hit her!
- Come on. Hit her, Grandpa.
Come on, I'm telling you...
Remember those thieves?
Come on. One-hitter.
- Come on, Grandpa.
- Hit her. Hit her, Grandpa.
Come on, you won't miss her.
Come on, Grandpa.
Hit her. Hit that bitch. Hit that bitch.
Come on, Grandpa.
Come on, Grandpa. You can do it.
You're the best.
Come on, there, Grandpa.
Come on, there, Grandpa.
Come on, Grandpa. You can do it.
You're the best.
Hit that bitch, Grandpa. Hit her.
Come on, Grandpa. Hit her.
You are, Grandpa. You're the best.
Yeah! That's good, isn't it, Grandpa?
Grandpa!
- Attaboy, Grandpa.
- Hit that bitch, now, Grandpa.
- Come on, Grandpa. You can do it.
- Get her now, Grandpa. You can do it.
Come on, Grandpa.
No! No! No!
No! No! No! No!
No! No!
Hit that bitch. Hit that bitch!
Come on, Grandpa!
Oh, Grandpa, let's get on with it.
All right! Slurpee-booty time!

Boys, boys, boys.
What the hell's going on here?
Is that the American way of entering
a man's home, singing like that?
I get it.
The old pressure game, huh?
Boys, you never
should have been doing this.
Who sent you?
Those sissies over at Del-Mar Catering?
That chickenshit Burrito-Man bunch?
Well, I don't care, you hear?
Yeah, that's right.
It's a dog-eat-dog world.
And from where I sit,
there just ain't enough damn dogs.
If you can't stand the heat,
get out of the damn kitchen.
How much, huh?
Let's make a deal right here.
Real cash money.
Just you and me, huh?
I don't care who sent you.
I'm the Lord of the Harvest.
Who's that?
Some new health-food bunch?
Come on. Come on.
Is there any money in it,
you wanna know?
Yeah, right here.
How much? How much?
- Lefty.
- Sister.
Lefty!
Brazos!
Run, sister. Run.
Small businessman that...
...always, always, always
gets it in the ass!
Sure... Sure took care of my hems.
Saved a trip to the hospital.
Ah. Looks... Looks bad.
Sure burned my beans bad on that one.
Maybe it's time to just shut down.
Time to shut down the show, yeah.
Yeah, pull the plug.
Come here, nubbins.
Where...
Where's that old "Fuck you, Charlie"?
That little "Just in case, baby"?
Where'd you put it?
Ah! Yeah, there it is.
Man... Man builds a good, sturdy trade
by hooking and crooking.
And then, kerplooey!
The gods just kick him
right in the balls.
Oh, no, not this time.
No! No!
Ah!
I got the last laugh right here.
Ah!
Going down, now!
Going down! Going down, now!
Whoa!
Here I come, you hog bitch!
You hog bitch!
Dead end, girl. Dead end now.
Dead-end city.
Look at my face.
Look. Look!
It's like death eating
a cracker, isn't it? Huh?
Huh?!
No!
Get away from her! Get away!
Don't touch her! No!
Grandma!
No!
Grandma! Grandma!
Grandma!
You killed her, you hog bitch!
Die!
