<i>(woman)</i> Happy New Year!
<i>(both)</i>
Should auld acquaintance be forgot...
No. I would never forget you.
I will never forget <i>you.</i>
- After you, my dear.
- Thank you.
Oh, dear!
- Call me if you get blue.
- I <i>am</i> blue.
Call me.
Phone'll be ringing
by the time you get home.
Here I go.
Wait till she gets in, please.
- Allison.
- What?
Happy New Year.
Happy New Year, honey.
Bye.
<i>(woman in car giggles)</i>
Gracie Mansion, please.
<i>(giggling)</i>
Fish! They've multiplied!
Oh
Lord Jeffrey Amherst was a soldier
Royal and true
And he served all the Indians
who didn't do his sight
Oh, Amherst, dear...
Oh, hello.
Ten hut! Line up!
Hello, Pepino.
Hello, little Lord Byron.
Come here.
Come here and lay one on me.
<i>(screams)</i>
<i>(choking)</i>
<i>(crowd)</i> Four... three... two... one...
Happy New Year!
Frank! Just wait a minute. Forget it.
- Just forget it.
- That's easy to say.
You don't understand.
See, I don't care any more.
I don't care what makes sense any more.
I don't give a rusty fuck
if they boot me down the City Hall steps
and send me back to the Bronx,
we gotta get this guy!
Everything that can be done
is being done.
My daughter was with her last night.
My child. It could have been her!
- This is not politics any more.
- Everything's politics!
The hell it is!
- I can't even sleep.
- Bullshit!
When you point at some guy and you say
"This is the guy that can do the job",
ain't the flashbulbs going?
Don't you read it
in the papers the next day?
Get me your brother,
and get him now, and get him
before you go to the ballet, Frank.
Get those hoses up here!
Come on! Move your ass!
Move it!
In the window! Put it in the window!
Turn it up!
Get that pressure up!
Turn it up, dammit!
- Chief.
- Yeah?
- I'm looking for one of your men.
- Who are you?
- Franklin Starkey.
- I'm Chief Sunday. Who do you want?
- Nick Starkey.
- He's in there.
Well, get him out here.
I have to talk to him.
It remains to be seen
whether or not he <i>is</i> comin' out.
Tell them to get the hoses up!
That window! Over there!
Get choppin'! Get choppin' now!
Come on, move it! Move it, dammit!
Stay with it, man.
Hey, advance that line!
Hi there.
I'll take it from here, Nick.
I wonder if I could get a cup of coffee.
Preferably espresso.
- I'm not happy to see you, Frank.
- You should be.
I've come to take you away from all this
and make you a big shot.
I never wanted to be a big shot.
That's your thing.
You must be up shit's creek
to be here talking to me.
- The mayor knows you're good.
- You must have amnesia to be here.
Now calm down, Nick.
- I'm a fireman.
- We're going to reinstate you.
I'm a fireman now!
We're gonna take all the heat
we have to from the press.
I run into these fucking buildings
when they're on fire!
You'll get a commendation
for what you did tonight.
- Please, don't bother on my account.
- That was very heroic.
Go, Frank.
Go.
There's a lot between us.
- And none of it is good.
- Please.
It's my career.
All right.
I'll come back.
Frank.
On one condition.
<i>(applause)</i>
- What do you think of Maria?
- Who's Maria?
- The ballerina.
- She doesn't trust her partner enough.
- Should she?
- I don't think she has any other choice.
- Where's Frank?
- I don't know. He's late.
In that case, let me
see you through intermission.
Mrs Starkey,
where's the commissioner tonight?
Here he is. Excuse me.
Duty calls and Christine goes.
I was beginning to think
you wouldn't make it.
I had to go, um...
I had to talk to Nick.
He's being reinstated in the department
as the new special investigator.
How is he? Did he agree?
You look flushed.
The dance was very stirring.
- Usually you're bored.
- Did he agree?
- Yeah.
- I can't believe it.
Why not? After all, he is my brother.
- Well, that never stood in <i>your</i> way.
- Are you siding with him?
Franklin, you should know
better than that.
What did you have to promise him?
- Hi, Ramon.
- I am thinking. I am thinking.
All right, all right.
<i>(parrot squawking)</i>
Hi, Ed.
Will you get that animal, please?
Put it at her feet.
Don't smile, Olympia.
<i>(parrot chattering)</i>
<i>(parrot)</i> Watch your hands, buddy.
Watch your hands.
- Like that?
- Very good.
- Stay.
<i>- (parrot chattering)</i>
Shut up!
Ed, why didn't you use <i>your</i> apartment?
You've got the light.
Look, I'm making dinner tonight.
Can I borrow my table?
Sure.
Just languish there, darling.
Don't molest anything.
Ed, do you want a job?
- What's a job?
- Work, for money.
- Money?
- Yeah.
- Do you remember money?
- Yeah, I remember it.
What do you think?
It's irritating to me that I need money.
I shouldn't need it.
I don't agree.
It's good, every once in a while,
to get roped into somebody else's,
you know...
What?
Problem.
For money?
Right.
<i>(humming)</i>
I'm gonna have a press conference
tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock.
The governor's best speech writer
is gonna write the statement.
The fucking guy is a poet.
I'll have the hardliners
wringing their handkerchiefs out.
The prodigal son. Forgive and forget.
For everything there's a season.
How do we face the terrifying
spectacle of Nick Starkey,
what he may do, what he may not do?
Whoop-de-do and la-di-da. <i>(chuckles)</i>
Oh, yeah. Well, anyway, I wanna get goin'.
I wanna start workin' on it tonight.
I wanna get all the borough presidents
standing up there with me.
If I can get that prick with the scarlet
cape, the cardinal, to stand up,
I'm gonna get him up there, too.
And you, you're gonna be to my right.
I want it to look like the city is united
in bringing Nick Starkey back.
I don't want it to look like his brother's
bringing him clean underwear.
I'll take care of all the questions. No
matter how rough they get, I'll be pious.
But when it's over, take a break,
let 'em have a shot at you.
And then give 'em some hard talk back.
Two or three minutes, but be
conservative. Very, very conservative.
And if you blow, blow with dignity.
I'm gonna be dog meat after this.
No, you're not.
If he comes out of this looking great,
I'm an asshole for firing him.
If he blows it,
I'm a schmuck for bringing him back.
If he blows it, we're all unemployed,
and if he gets the guy, we're all heroes.
It's like Elizabeth Taylor says:
"There is no deodorant like success."
<i>(buzzer)</i>
- What is it?
<i>- Captain Alcoa's here.</i>
Oh, shit. He heard.
OK, send him in.
I won't do it. I won't do it!
- Do what?
- Don't bullshit me besides screwing me!
We're all having a bad day, Alcoa.
- Nick Starkey is not a policeman!
- His record shows otherwise.
- He don't belong in the department.
- That's for me to say.
He's a fucking beatnik!
He's got a beatnik mentality.
Well, maybe
that's what we need is a beatnik.
Sure. Seems funny down here and now.
But it don't feel so fuckin' funny
in the middle of a murder case
when you see those girls dead!
Who do you think you're talking to?
Jesus Christ!
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to?
Do you think I'm your wife? You wanna
fuck me? Well, don't mess with me.
You mess with me and you better have
a goddamn sense of humour
the size of Lake Michigan
to find something to laugh about.
And if I send you a rubber duck
to work with, that is the news!
Can you understand that?
Do you understand?
So, then, it's true?
It's true.
- When?
- Tomorrow.
So you get outta here,
and you be a good boy,
and if Nick reports to you, you treat him
like a god. Do you understand that?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
If he wants anything, you give it to him.
If he wants your wallet, you give it to him.
Keep me posted.
Never mind trying to say anything.
Just shut up and get out. Go on!
I'm trying to have a meeting here.
<i>(door slams)</i>
So, did Nick agree without a fuss?
No.
Well, what do you have to do?
I had to let him cook dinner
for my wife tonight.
OK.
<i>(doorbell)</i>
Come in. Door's open.
It's been open for two years.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- What, is it snowing?
- A little.
Well, take off your clothe... coat.
Make yourself comfortable.
I gotta change.
- How you doing, Sam?
<i>- (parrot whistles and chatters)</i>
Oh, shit.
Nick!
Nick!
- What is it?
- Why did you make me come here?
- I wanted to make you dinner.
- You always make me things that I hate!
I try to. Sh! Listen.
What?
The wine. It's breathing.
I decanted it an hour and a half ago.
- How much did it cost?
- $6.
I won't like it. I never like any wine
that costs less than $20.
- No matter how good it tastes?
- That's right.
I'll pour you a glass.
- What do you think?
- I hate it.
Here.
This is balsamic vinegar.
Sprinkle some on the octopus. It's great.
Where'd you get that scar?
- A burn from a fire.
- Oh, right. You're a fireman.
- Till yesterday.
- It's hard to picture.
Burning building, everybody else
runs out, you run in.
Basically, it's a maniac's job.
- Marinated eggplant?
- No, thanks.
Have you forgiven Franklin?
For what? Did he do something wrong?
He betrayed you.
Did he?
He needed a fall guy and he gave 'em you.
- Did he?
- Yes.
- His own brother?
- That's right.
How should I feel about that?
- I guess you should be mad.
- Then that's what I am.
I'm mad.
- Anything else I should be mad about?
- Yes.
- What?
- Me.
Right. I should be mad about you.
And that is my fucking curse.
I am... still mad about you.
I should go.
Yeah.
You should.
You hate the food
and you married the wrong man.
I'll get my coat.
I am not gonna sleep with you
while you're married.
I'm not gonna sleep with <i>you!</i>
That's right! You're not!
Not if you beg me on your knees.
I may covet my brother's wife,
but I won't boff her.
- You have not changed.
- Neither have you, but you should.
Chris, Chris, Chris, Chris.
- Haven't you missed me?
- Please, don't.
When you close your eyes,
don't you see my face?
Nick, don't.
How do you make love to him after me?
How do you get wet?
Do you think about the money?
- There was a cheque.
- What?
The last night I saw you.
Two years ago, here.
There was a cancelled cheque
on the table.
I don't know what you're talking about.
There was a cancelled cheque
on that table right there,
made out to my brother Frank.
After you left, it was gone.
- Are you accusing me?
- I'm telling you.
Well, you're wrong.
Maybe.
Thanks for stopping by.
<i>(helicopter)</i>
<i>(mayor)</i> I've got one more minute.
I can take one question.
Do you think Nick Starkey can expect
the support of the police department,
given his departure of two years ago?
Understand this - there was
no hard evidence of graft, right?
- What's going to happen to him?
- Let me finish or you can come and do it.
All right. Now, because he was under
a cloud, we were under a cloud.
So we made what you might call
a political decision.
And he was wonderful. He put
the department's good ahead of his good.
He could have fought it, but he knew what
he'd destroy, and I respect him for that.
And at this moment
I think he's the obvious choice,
in this dangerous juncture of time,
to lead the investigation.
We have to do something, and I think that
Lieutenant Starkey can make it happen.
That's all for today.
The show is over. I gotta go.
Bye-bye.
Commissioner, how do you feel about
your brother being special investigator?
I've very glad
my brother's been reinstated.
Obviously I was grieved
by his difficulties of two years ago
and hoped the day might come when he
could resume his career. It has come.
<i>- No one is happier than me.</i>
- Yeah, you look ecstatic.
<i>That was Police Commi...</i>
Cone.
Come in here.
Yes, sir?
When Lieutenant Starkey reports,
keep him away from me.
Give him Olson's old office.
Lieutenant Starkey's already reported, sir.
- He has?
- Yes, sir.
And he didn't like Olson's old office, so
he took the big one at the end of the hall.
He doesn't like Olson's office?
He said the light was no good.
- What light?
- You know, sir, the sunlight.
Sunlight?
What's he need sunlight for?
- For Ed.
- For Ed?
Yes, sir.
- Who's Ed?
- The painter.
That office doesn't need to be painted.
He's not that kind of painter, Captain.
He's a... You know.
He paints paintings. He's an artist.
What's goin' on here?
- You told him?
- Yeah.
- You told him about the painter?
- Yeah.
- I got a sweet tooth for this shit.
- I love it.
<i>(reggae music playing)</i>
<i>(parrot)</i> Hi, Butch.
<i>(Nick)</i> Captain Alcoa.
You want some espresso?
- Do I hear crickets?
- Yeah, it's a tape. Isn't it great?
Who's that?
- That's Ed.
- The painter?
<i>(Nick)</i> That's right. You want sugar?
Why's the furniture in the hall?
I didn't want it. I wanted space.
Did you miss me?
I don't have any place to put that furniture.
I don't want it,
but I'll tell you what I do want.
All reports, photos, news accounts,
background of any kind
on every one of the murders.
Everything on that last murder first.
Then everything on the very first murder.
You must have a shitload of stuff by now.
We do. It's like a library.
- It's in 202.
- Then leave it in 202. I'll go to it.
OK.
And put Ed on the payroll.
- As what?
- My assistant.
No, no. I'll assign you an assistant.
I need Ed.
OK.
And... I need an NEC computer,
Lotus Agenda.
We have about five Bedbecks.
- Bedbecks are no good. I need the NEC.
- I need the NEC.
OK.
You're not drinking your espresso,
<i>mon capitaine.</i>
Oh, well. I gotta go.
- Where are you going?
- I'll be back about three.
Where would I be going?
It's a beautiful day.
I put on my best dress and go to a funeral.
- Hang in there, Ed.
- OK.
<i>(parrot)</i> Up yours, copper.
<i>(priest)</i> But we must meet
calamity with introspection.
Allison Hawkins was a member
of the Hawkins family.
She has gone,
but the Hawkins family remains.
The family remains
and something of Allison remains.
In them. In each of them
and in all of them.
You are in shock now and you are in pain.
When this coffin is shouldered
and carried from this church,
grieve your grief, let it go.
Trust in God.
Believe, repair, live.
Open your hymnals, please.
- I'm sorry. Are you OK?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.
- Do I know you?
- No.
- You're Nick Starkey.
- Yeah.
- I know your brother.
- Oh. Good for you.
- Were you following me?
- Yeah.
Why?
You were the prettiest one at the funeral.
Can I buy you some hot chocolate?
Sure.
So... do you usually go
from funerals to ice-skating?
No.
- Makes sense to me.
- It does?
Yeah.
What's funny?
My father thinks you're a genius.
I am.
You know, let's forget this.
You don't wanna question me?
- No.
- What's the matter?
Nothing.
In a hundred years we'll all be dead.
So?
So...
My friend Allison and I
spent New Year's Eve together.
I keep going over
our conversation in my head.
We didn't really
say anything to one another.
It was like most conversations, I guess,
except it happened to be her last.
And then today, that funeral...
I just kept thinking...
how much of life is wasted.
I mean, we're sitting here,
we're talking to each other.
Shouldn't we be
really talking to each other?
All right.
All right.
I saw my brother's wife,
Christine, last night.
She and I were an item at one time,
so it was a very painful evening.
And now, today, I see you
and I find you very... attractive.
And I'm feeling vulnerable
because of last night,
so my feeling is, my instinct as a man
is I don't wanna ask you
a lot of pushy questions,
because I want you to like me.
In fact, how real do you want
this conversation to get?
Because saying these things out loud
has made me wanna go to the next step
and say to you...
this restaurant's a five-minute walk
from seven hotels.
- It is?
- It is.
And I'd like to get a room in one of them,
right now, and take you there.
- You would?
- Yeah, I would.
What do you say?
In a hundred years we'll all be dead.
What do you say?
But...
Yeah?
Just exactly how old are you?
- 23.
- Oh, God.
Is something missing?
Nothing's missing. This is what happens.
What are you talking about?
I knew when I came back into this world
I'd start having weird behaviour like this.
Like what?
- 23 years old.
- Oh, sh. So what?
And look - you're on top.
I gotta get outta here.
So, go.
What if I had a heart attack
and they found me with you?
I'm speechless.
So, where are we going now?
Where are <i>we</i> going?
How do you figure that?
Listen... I haven't felt safe.
I feel safe right now.
Let me have a little more of that.
All right.
Show me where Allison Hawkins lived.
Which window was hers?
You see that right there?
Next to the lights.
Come on. I wanna take a look.
Thanks.
<i>(Allison's faint voice singing)</i>
<i>(Allison screaming)</i>
Everybody knows where I live.
I kept having these nightmares last night.
I mean, I know my house is safe,
supposedly, but it's giving me the creeps.
Everybody knows where I live.
I'm gonna have to get back
to the precinct. I gotta work tonight.
I understand.
You can stay at my apartment if you want.
- You'd be by yourself.
- Could I?
- Sure.
- That'd be great.
I'll call my father and make an excuse.
- Good.
- Thanks.
Ed, why are you still here?
I'm just trying to get the hang of this.
Well, go home.
This is Bernadette.
Bernadette, this is Ed.
He lives in my building.
She's gonna stay at my place tonight,
so would you show her in?
Sure.
- Hi, Ed.
- Hi.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
So long.
So, go, go.
Ed, I'll see you in the morning.
OK.
- <i>(Frank)</i> Where are you going?
- <i>(Nick)</i> For a walk.
- Where?
- Nowhere.
To get away from you.
What have you figured out
about the case?
This guy, whoever he is,
he's fabulous with locks.
In seven of these cases
the guy picked the lock.
Some of these locks
were supposed to be unpickable.
What else?
He's not just smart with locks,
he's just smart.
Very bright, in a useless kind of way.
Cracked as an old teacup.
You don't get away pulling 11 murders
unless you got a brain like a Swiss watch.
You don't murder 11 women
unless you're plain fucking crazy.
Or you haven't figured out the motive.
I haven't figured out the motive.
That's a separate problem.
I mean, I know the motive.
What is it?
This man has a lot of anger
towards women.
That's fucking brilliant.
It must have been his mother.
The blue ribbon's an interesting touch.
I mean, blue ribbon. It's an award.
Maybe the mother... rewarded the kid
with something that strangled him.
Maybe the constant rewarding
by the mother
was the thing that caused
the feeling of being strangled.
I bet this guy overachieves
like gangbusters.
<i>(truck horn)</i>
<i>(men shouting)</i>
<i>(Nick)</i> "Prime cut." Prime!
What are you talking about?
I'm about to know when
he'll kill the next girl.
- When?
- I'll call you when I got it figured.
Listen, Frank... You and me, we got
something in common with the murderer.
We do?
- Maybe you do.
- Just like him, we've got a mother.
Don't go comparing our mother to his.
- Our mother had an effect on us.
- Don't say a word about our mother!
You see, she's dead
and we're still fighting over her.
- She had a big effect.
- Get back to talking about the case.
- Like with your wife.
- Don't bring my wife into this!
- I'm warning you.
- You're right. It's really about our mother.
Frank, I got one thing to say to you.
And it's hard, but I gotta say it.
And if you can accept it, a lot
of other shit's gonna fall into place.
Frank, Mom loved me more than you.
That's why I took the fall for you, Frank.
I wish you'd just fucking die.
<i>(record player)</i> <i>And I know the feeling</i>
<i>And I love the feeling</i>
<i>You're fanning the coals</i>
<i>And the flame in my soul's all I know</i>
- <i>Yes, I know the feeling</i>
<i>- (doorbell)</i>
<i>And I need the feeling</i>
<i>This time I swear</i>
- <i>I won't let it go</i>
<i>- (doorbell)</i>
Ah.
Hello.
Hello.
- Bernadette, isn't it?
- Yes, yes. Mrs Starkey.
I think we met
at the mayor's birthday party.
And at the opera also, I think.
- And now here.
- And now here.
- Would you like to come in?
- No.
- He's not here.
- Who?
Nick.
Right.
No, I think I'll just be going
before there's a traffic jam.
Oh.
Oh, my God.
Hey, Cone.
- You know what a prime number is?
- Any number... What is it?
Any number that can only
be divided by one and itself.
Whatever you say.
There are 12 prime numbers
possible out of 31 days.
These are the dates of the murders.
<i>- (Cone)</i> Wow.
<i>- (Nick)</i> 11 prime numbers.
- What's the twelfth?
- Five.
What's today?
January 4th.
Then he's gonna kill
the next girl tomorrow night.
Where?
I don't know.
Well, I better leave you to figure.
You're the real thing.
Hm?
You're a real shamus.
I know when the guy's gonna hit again.
- You gotta give me your cooperation.
- Fuck you! And don't even look at me.
I don't work for you. You work for me.
You think you can come in my office
and tell me the news
like I'm some monkey-do
lieutenant? Fuck you!
You are not a policeman!
I am a fucking policeman!
Get it, you dilettante fuck?!
No matter what the mayor says.
I'm gonna need a backup unit
tomorrow night on call. Maybe all night.
If I ever get my hands on a shred of paper
that proves that you were
on the take back when,
I will delight in getting
the charcoal for the barbecue.
I'm gonna need the team in the van
with the motor running.
Tomorrow's the night.
That's when he's gonna hit.
Maybe for the last time.
Where?
I don't know yet.
<i>- (Cone) Yes, Captain Alcoa.</i>
- Get me Emergency Service Unit.
Christine, I understand you had dinner
with Nick. I wanna know what happened.
Did he say he was gonna
talk to anybody further
about the scandal that happened
about two years back?
I mean, not that
there's anything to talk about.
He thinks there's a cheque.
A cheque?
A cancelled cheque.
Made out to you, Frank.
From who?
Well, it would be a crooked road, Eamon,
but I think it would be traced back to you.
- Does Nick have this cheque?
- No. I don't even think he's looking for it.
- You don't?
- I don't think so.
I think he's much more interested
right now in fucking your daughter.
What are you talking about?
You don't understand what I'm saying?
I'm sorry. Picture it.
Well, look at your cigar
and think of your daughter.
Don't bother to get up.
It's all right. Roger will see me home.
- What are you doing?
- I'm checking into a hotel, Frank.
And out of the whorehouse.
Lovely meal. Thank you. Good night.
It's here.
<i>(Bernadette)</i> What's here?
Tomorrow night is here.
February, March,
April, May,
June, July,
August, September,
October, November,
December.
January.
These are the rooms
where each murder was committed.
Where?
<i>(opera music)</i>
- Have you got my paper?
- No paper for 12C, sir.
Let me take a look
and see if my paper's there.
<i>(screeching tyres)</i>
Can you do a whole
part of town this way?
Sure. You wanna see the big picture?
Oh, God.
Can this and meet me out front.
There's been another murder,
but we got the son of a bitch.
<i>(Nick)</i> Tonight?
Hello, Captain. Hello, sir.
The woman's upstairs. Named Lana
Apico. Strangled in her own apartment.
He strangled her,
walked to the dining room,
jumped right through
the fuckin' window.
The son of the bitch
has the ribbon right in his hand.
It's gonna make
a great picture for <i>The Post.</i>
- How'd he get in?
- He broke in through a window.
- Broke in?
- Yeah.
The window was gated. He kicked it in
and waited for her in the bedroom.
Wait. Nobody gets through. I'm sorry.
- Hello, Alcoa.
- Hello, sir.
- And you are?
- Detective Reilly, sir.
Good to meet you, Reilly.
- He killed himself, huh?
- Yes, sir.
- <i>(Frank)</i> Hi, Nick.
- Not him.
Pretty ironic, huh?
- What?
- Well, he killed himself.
We didn't need Sherlock Holmes after all.
That's my father's car.
- Hi, Dad.
- What the hell are you doing here?
Never mind. I heard.
We'll talk about it later.
- Go before they take your picture.
- What's the matter?
Would you do what I say? Get out of here!
Don't become a liability, little girl.
Apparently he just jumped, sir.
Oh, my God. There he is.
The whole city is frightened to death
for a year because of just one guy.
- Well, thank God that's over.
- Maybe.
- What do you mean "maybe"?
- I don't think this is the man.
He strangled a woman, he's got
the ribbon. What are you talking about?
- Why'd he kill himself?
- How the fuck do I know?
He murders 11 women, no problem.
He murders one more, he feels so bad,
he jumps out the window?
I don't buy it.
And why'd he break in? He never broke
anything before. He just picked the lock.
And then there's the date.
Not a prime number. It doesn't figure.
Let me tell you something.
Life is like that sometimes.
You were wrong, that's all.
I'd like to take a look at the apartment.
You wanna see the apartment,
Commissioner?
I'll be up in a minute.
- Eamon, could you take a look at this?
- What is it?
A statement for the press.
- You gonna make it?
- Yes.
All right.
It's all over. It's all over.
It's over. The commissioner'll
have a statement for you.
- Can we leave?
- Sure.
Excuse me.
The commissioner
has a statement for you.
<i>(reporters shout questions)</i>
Tonight... comes to an end
12 months of fear.
- See ya, Nick.
- Thanks.
All right, I'm a fireman!
Jesus!
What are you doing here?
Ed let me in.
Well, he was wrong to do that.
- Nick, what's wrong?
- I'm very tired.
- Why don't you come here and sit down?
- No.
When they want you, they need you.
The rest of the time...
- Can I help you?
- You? You're the mayor's daughter.
I could do a number on him,
but I wouldn't bother.
What are you talking about?
Don't you get it?
This wasn't it. That wasn't him.
- Then who was that?
- Some guy! Some other crazy.
Tomorrow night, while your father
and my brother and all the other slobs
who only care about the way it looks and
don't give a shit about how it actually is,
while they're all slapping
themselves on the back,
the January Man
is gonna get his January Girl.
So stop him.
- I've been fired.
- So solve it anyway.
Nick, I woke up here today.
I saw how you live.
I see what you like around you.
I understand you wanna run away
from these people. I understand.
It's their responsibility.
No. They don't know what that means.
- I'm tired.
- I know.
I know you are.
So we're gonna go to bed, OK?
And then we'll sleep.
And then tomorrow,
after a good breakfast,
you're gonna catch the killer
and save the girl.
OK?
OK.
- <i>(Nick)</i> How old did you say you were?
- Shut up.
<i>(Bernadette)</i> In a hundred years
we'll all be dead.
<i>(Nick)</i> The stars'll still be shining.
The stars.
Of course.
And all the constellations.
<i>(man) At this time of year, Virgo has</i>
<i>just become visible in the eastern sky.</i>
I love this.
Time is running out, Nick.
In order to be brilliant,
you gotta be in touch with the universe.
<i>Halley's Comet swings across our skies</i>
<i>once every 75 or 76 years.</i>
That wasn't the guy last night.
Yes, it was. Don't you read the paper?
The commissioner called me himself
to say the case is closed.
He made it clear
that I should give you abuse.
Shitwork.
So you'd resign. I don't think
he even wants you in the fire department.
- Why are you telling me this?
- Cos I don't like you.
There's no place for you here.
But I respect you.
It's like the army.
Wartime hero, peacetime fuck-up.
That's you.
Transfer to the fire department. I ain't got
the stomach to be your brother's stooge.
I need a backup team. Maybe a decoy.
I need your help for 12 more hours
and then I'll go back.
I can't. I can't, even if I wanted to.
- Don't give me that, skipper!
- I can't get Emergency Service.
The commissioner says from now on
all ES orders go through him.
And I ain't gonna put a decoy
out on the street without backup.
All right, all right.
You got what you got, and that's
all the support you're gonna get.
I'll look the other way till tomorrow.
And then I'll expect a request for transfer.
And, in the meantime, unless
you see a man strangling a woman,
don't call for backup.
Cos it ain't gonna come.
- Lift your head.
- Sure.
How's that feel?
OK.
Hello.
Ready?
- Feel anything?
- No.
I like attention as much
as the next girl, but... No, it's fine.
- Actually, it digs in a little bit.
- I'll put some tape over that.
Right. There's a puzzle
on the computer I gotta sort out.
Let's get downtown.
All right. Here we go.
Can you mark the 11 buildings
where the murders took place?
Now can you make the rest of the city
disappear and just leave the dots?
Virgo.
Stars.
Ed, there's a star missing. Find it.
Get a star chart to scale.
Find it, superimpose it on the map,
then we'll know the building. Find it.
OK, now, we got one more problem.
Which window and which floor?
You got all that in the computer, right?
All right, Ed.
- I'll be right back with the stars.
- Great.
Very good, Eddie.
OK. He likes to fill in squares.
Let's fill in the murder windows.
OK, find the pattern, find the pattern.
OK, all on the same floor.
Down one here.
Back up to the original floor. OK.
So...
Let's make the distance
between the dots uniform.
What do you suppose it forms?
It can't be another astrological sign,
so what is it, what is it, what is it?
Now, what is that?
Music.
Yeah.
I feel like I'm waiting
for the other shoe to drop.
It was a nifty theory.
Da, da, da, da, da...
Seven notes in a row.
<i>(both sing rhythms)</i>
What's that?
- No, I just made that up.
- Seven notes in a row.
<i>(both sing rhythms)</i>
No, no, no.
But what is that?
That, right there.
Yes.
What did you just...? Do it again.
<i>(both sing rhythm)</i>
I love, I love my little Calendar Girl
<i>(sings rhythm)</i>
Yeah
<i>(Nick)</i> 16th floor.
Only two single women live on the
16th floor with windows facing this way,
and one of them
is currently visiting Disney World.
- You're getting to be a real cop, Ed.
- Thank you.
This is it.
<i>(whispers)</i> Keep going.
We'll set up in here.
All right.
One of us always watches the door.
Take 30-minute shifts. If it's the guy,
we just take note and let him go in.
If it's the woman, you know what to do.
Bernadette, you take the first watch.
Ed, what's for dinner?
Mm.
Nothing edible?
Oi.
Prime number, Virgo and Calendar Girl?
I can say it now - I had my doubts.
Why don't we just take him now?
No. Right now
it's just breaking and entering.
We gotta surprise him
in flagrante homicido.
Relax.
Listen, we're with the police department.
I am a police lieutenant.
Lieutenant Starkey, see?
There is a man - a killer, a strangler -
waiting right inside your apartment door.
If you'd gone through that door,
you'd be dead now. Understand?
So we're gonna send someone in, in your
place, and we're gonna catch this man.
Do you understand?
Is that all right with you?
All right, Ed.
Thanks.
- All right. You ready, Bernadette?
- Yeah.
- Scared?
- Yeah.
You're gonna be all right.
Now, listen.
You open the door, you close the door.
You start to take off your coat. As soon as
you feel that ribbon, you start screaming.
It'll be a piece of cake.
And what's the next part again?
- I save you.
- Don't forget that part.
Now, if I close the door behind me,
how are you getting in?
Sledgehammer.
I thought you were supposed to
shoot the lock off with a gun.
- I don't have a gun.
- You don't?
Stop worrying.
Ed, I think it'd be best
if you don't come in.
You've got it. I'm an artist.
I'll watch the woman.
Let's go.
<i>(Nick)</i> Jesus!
<i>(Nick)</i> Hang on!
Nick! Come on!
I'm coming!
- <i>(Nick)</i> Hang on!
- Nick!
Oh, Jesus. Nick! Come on!
Nick!
- Bernadette!
- Hurry!
You dirty murdering pig!
- You all right?
- I'm alive.
My name is Lieutenant Nicholas Starkey.
You are under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent...
You really wanna play this out?
I had a hard time finding you
and I'm not about to let you go.
Call Alcoa.
You have the right to legal counsel.
Oh, shit!
Hi. Give me the Second Precinct, please.
It's an emergency.
What?
What?!
- Hello, Mrs Starkey.
- Hi. Lieutenant Starkey's not in his office.
- Do you know where he is?
- I don't know.
Get backup. Get the commissioner.
Get three squad cars.
Tell them to get to this address
and to get the fuck there!
Nick's goin' at it with the strangler!
- I thought the strangler was dead.
- So did I.
And get me a car.
And get me the fuck there!
<i>(Alcoa)</i> Get the fuck out of my way!
I'm sorry, ma'am.
You'll have to excuse us.
Of course.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi. Where's my door?
- It's on the floor.
<i>(elevator bell rings)</i>
Grab the elevator.
How am I doin'?
Listen, stop kicking me. I hate that.
Stop that. You're not getting away.
Why don't you just fuckin' accept it?
I hate this job.
I told you to stop. But no.
All the force necessary, you know?
Do you hear them?
All right, that's it.
You want to fight? You want to fight?!
All right, come on. Come on!
<i>(sirens)</i>
<i>(Alcoa)</i>
Deploy these fucking men properly!
What's going on?
Nick's in there with the strangler.
- What about the guy we got?
- It came over the radio.
They just made the guy
we pegged for the strangler.
He got out of the loony bin
about three days ago.
He's been in there two years.
Fuck!
OK, are we rolling? Commissioner...
- Sorry, lady. Police personnel only.
- Do you know who I am?
<i>(Nick)</i> Come on.
I wonder if I could get a cup of coffee.
Preferably espresso.
- Does anybody know this guy?
- Who he is ain't important.
That's the problem with him. He's nobody.
Hi.
What are you doing here?
I left Frank.
You'll never change. Go away.
You love me.
No, Christine. I loved
an idea I had that looked like you.
Nick.
Here's the cheque.
Darling, don't say
I never gave you anything.
Good luck, Bernadette.
The world's either great
or wretched, isn't it?
So many people are just finished.
You think, huh?
I don't know, really.
All I know is, I'm going home.
- I quit.
- The job?
Yes. I'm going home,
I'm gonna mix some paint
and I'm gonna try and do
something original. See ya.
Listen...
I wanna make you dinner.
You know, in a couple of days.
Yeah? OK. That'd be nice.
I wanna make you haggis.
- What's haggis?
- It's a Scottish dish.
You take the stomach of a sheep,
and then you stuff it with
the sheep's lungs, liver and heart,
some onions, suet and oatmeal,
and then you boil the whole thing.
Well, I don't know.
It sounds a little weird.
But I'm game to try it.
- Ow.
- Ow.
