Oh, yeah it's the Wave 88.1 ,
and the quiet before the storm has passed
and Spring Break has arrived
to Lake Victoria!
The next few days,
all 25 square miles of our beautiful lake
is gonna be covered in babes,
boats and bikinis!
So, if you felt the earth move this morning,
it wasn't just the party.
Seems like Lake Vic
was the centre of a light quake.
So, if you see some scientist types
out there on the lake, hand them a cold one.

Officer, it was a mistake.
Can't we just work something out here?
Mistake or no mistake,
you destroyed public property,
and from the smell of your breath,
I suggest you take the ticket,
get a ride home with your friends.
I was kinda hoping
you might drive me home.
Touching an officer's uniform is considered
assault - were you aware of that?
Come on, you look pretty hot in tan.
Oh!
It's not tan, it's beige.

Kelly, hey!
I wasn't sure you were coming back...
for Spring Break.
Yeah, I'm...
I'm here.
I can only assume that you're down here
to get on one of those boats.
No, no, I came down to pick up
my little sister from her music lessons.
How about yourself?
I'm waiting for my ride. Todd and his friends,
we're gonna go check out some music.
Todd Dupree?
Remind me
who you're going out with again?
I have standards, all right?
That's all Im saying.
Todd's a really good DJ.
Kelly!
Let's go. Jump in, we're late.
He says he's got backstage passes
for Planters, you should come.
Yeah, I would, but I'm pretty much under
house arrest watching Zane and Laura.
Too bad.
- We'll miss you.
- I gotta go.
- Come on, let's go!
Yeah, hopefully I see you again before you...
..before you leave.
Way to make a move, Jake.
Hey-hey, ass wipe!
Cool shirt!
Nice horn.
Thanks.
Nice boobs.
Thanks.
I have a training bra
but I don't like to wear it because it itches.
Tell me about it.
Who you waiting for?
My brother, Jake. He's 17.
He'll like your boobs too.
- They all do.
- Come on, Laura, let's go.
- What happened to you?
- I don't wanna talk about it. Let's go.
Hi, Jake.
- Try not to stare at her boobs.
- Shut up!
- I like your shirt.
- You wanna throw something at me too?
No, actually, I like the Pixies.
Danni, Danni, Danni,
where the hell is Crystal?
Over there with Andrew.
They're getting sunscreen. I'm just waiting.
Sunscreen? Andrew, Crystal, we don't
need sunscreen, we need body paint,
we need condoms and Redi-Whip.
You tell her 10am tomorrow,
I want her bleached blond booty
at the marina.
Gotta get my first shot off by noon,
so bright and early, baby,
make sure those tittles
are nice and perky! Mm, ha!
Who's this?
This is Jake. He's a local.
A sand rat, huh?
D'you know your way around the lake?
- Yeah.
- D'you want a job? I pay cash money.
Don't bullshit me, Jake. My guy didn't show
and I need somebody ASAP,
somebody I can rely on,
somebody with ambition,
someone who's willing to take chances,
if you know what I mean.
Mister, you talk funny.
- Yeah, well, you're short.
Hold on.
This is Derrick.
Oh, no, no, no, don't you disappoint me,
motherfucker.
I told you, I want the biggest goddamn boat
this podunk town has to offer. Hold on.
Who is that?
Derrick? He's the director.
Oh, so are you like a...
an actress or what?
I'm a wild, wild girl.
..big boat, with a big motor.
What's a wild, wild girl, Jake?
Of course we know boats!
No, fuck the waiver, you sign the waiver!
- So, Jake, baby, we gonna do this?
- Do?
The job. Location scout. Guide us around,
show us all the good spots, the G-spots.
I need a local. I need you.
We're talking life lesson here, Jake.
Great, 10am tomorrow.
Don't be late and...
wear a different shirt.
- I guess we'll see you tomorrow, Jake.
- Actually, tomorrow he's...
- Jake.
Why you gonna knock
if you're just gonna walk in?
Am I disturbing you?
No, I'm just doing homework
and schoolwork and research for school.
Laura has been telling me that you may
have some other plans for tomorrow.
No, what's she talking about?
Im 100% babysitting.
What?
No, we don't want a babysitter!
- Yeah, Mom, especially not Jake.
- Especially not Jake.
I'm serious, we don't need...
- No, get out. Out. Out!
- No, please, Mom.
Mom, please, we have to talk about this.
- Mom!
- Jake, you know I do not have a backup.
Yeah, I know, Mom.
Don't worry.
I know how crazy this week is for you,
and Ill take care of the nitwits, OK?
Remember,
if you do not fulfil your responsibility,
I have the power to arrest
and imprison you.
I'm not 12. Playing the sheriff card
isn't gonna work any more.
- No?
- No.
Like I said, I'll take care of it, OK?
All right.
You better.
Get outta here.
- Next year I'll try to find another solution.
- All right.
- All right?
- OK.
Fuck.
- Oh, and Jake...
- Oh, Mom, come on! Really?
- It's time for dinner,
- All right, I'll be right there.
- Hope I didn't wake the kids.
- Oh, God, they'll sleep through anything.
Maggie said that yesterday
was the last time she saw him?
Yeah, just before noon.
She said Matt took the boat out
to catch some bass.
She drove around the lake all night
looking for him.
- Where's the boat?
- Over there.
Feeling like a skinny dip?
I think we can
make it to the end of the pier.
Meaning what -
I'm too old or too heavy?
I think you're too chickenshit.
-  By the way, Gordon called last night.
- Yeah?
He said the USGS recorded
heavy seismic activity beneath the lake.
Really?
They're sending in a team
of seismologist divers.
All right.
And he told them
that you're gonna escort them out.
Jesus Christ!
I've just been invaded by 20,000 kids -
makes us a little busy at the moment.
- That's what I told him.
-
This doesn't sound too good.
So, what time are the divers
gonna get here?
They said by ten.
Shit!
Come on, just a little more.
Oh, I can't get it.
Oh!
Jules!
Gimme your hand!
Do you think a propeller
could have done this?
I doubt it.
Look at the bones, nothing's broken.
It's like something acidic,
or toxic decomposition,
as if this body's been in the water
for weeks.
What would you say if I told you
that I'm thinking about closing the lake?
Just until we get an autopsy report.
An autopsy report
is gonna take a couple of days.
It'd be easier to drain this lake
than to close it.
It's a big financial week for our town.
I'm too old for this.
Whoo-hoo!
Aargh! Aargh!
Aargh!
- We're not lying to Mom.
- Yeah, we're not lying to Mom.
Every year it's the same thing,
I'm stuck here with you guys
while I miss all the Spring Break fun.
- You mean Spring Break boobies.
- What if I give you the babysitting cash?
- 60 bucks and you got a deal.
- 60? I'm only getting paid 40!
$20 deception surcharge.
Do not pick up the phone,
do not answer the door,
and do not leave the house.
OK? I'm counting on you guys.
All right?

our presence is requested at Kokomo's
by the Arizona State cheerleading team.
Hi, Im Sheriff Forester. Bob Gordon
asked me to take you out to the site.
Good to meet you.
I like the welcoming committee here.

- Sam, give those back. Come on.
According to the epicentre co-ordinates,
we need to go...here.
OK. That's about 20 minutes out.

Hey, sand rat, I'm talking to you!
Sand rat! Hello!
Where you been? We got the girls lubed up,
we're ready to roll!
I'm docking your pay cheque.
Come on, let's go!
Jake?
Now I see what you've been scouting
the last 15 minutes.
Kelly, it was great to see you,
I know you gotta get going.
Kelly! Kelly, hi, I'm Derrick Jones.
Hi.
- You know this guy?
- Who, Jake?
Jake is my boy.
Jake is the man with the plan,
the insight, the knowledge.
Wait...
those girls aren't with you, are they?
Uh, yeah.
Why, are you into girls?
No, Im just showing him around town,
just all the hot spots and stuff like that.
Jake, the job is called "location scout",
and Kelly, you should come with.
Today we're gonna be making
movie history.
She's got other plans already.
Kelly, do you like champagne?
I... I love champagne!
- Actually...
- No, no, no, no, wait...
I would love to come on your boat, Derrick,
thank you.
Someone has to keep an eye
on the man with the plan here, right?
Come on, come on, let me...
let me help you aboard.
Why? Why?
Dude, that's Kelly.
Kelly! Baby?
What happened to hanging with us today?
- ls that your boyfriend?
- No, he's just some guy from school.
Someone who says he has
backstage passes when he doesn't.
- Have a good day, Todd.
- Come on, Kelly!
Yo, have a t-shirt.
- What the fuck?
- That was Derrick Jones!
Is that Jake Forester?
Oh, fuck it!
We are off to shoot some
wildcore blow-your-mind footage,
with these wild, wild goddesses!
-
- Yeah!
We will see you all, four o'clock,
Canyon Beach,
- for the Lake Victoria wet t-shirt
- wild extravaganza!
-
Zane, we have to talk about this.
We told Jake we'd stay at the house.
I told him I'd fish,
and I can't if there aren't any.
The lake's too busy.
Come on, Sand Island's really close.
I should have brought my trombone.
No way, be a girl
and just sunbathe or something.
Well, when I become a rock star,
see if I let you be one of my groupies.
Gimme a break, dude!
You play the trombone!
Ladies, here we go,
- a little bubbly.
- Thank you.
- It's the finest your gas station has to offer.
-
-
- There we go. Drink up, Crystal.
- Yay!
- Enjoy and cheers.
- Cheers.
- To our newest wild, wild member.
-
- You are beautiful.
That's why we came here.
Derrick wants to capture innocence.
He says it's all about innocence.

Don't worry, Derrick's just making his play.
You might as well ask him not to breathe.

No, and...
I'm... This is great, I'm having a great time,
we're going wild, Im... Im going wild.
Hey, Jake,
how far is this place? Come on!
Yeah, yeah, we're almost there.
So speaking of going wild...
..you haven't seen anything yet.
Jake! Jake!
Yeah?
Jake!
Why don't you put it somewhere?
Anywhere you want.
Anywhere you want, baby.
Crystal, leave her alone,

You should be paying us today,
not the other way around.

this is what it's all about.

you've been to, sand rat!

- Uh, Mom, hey...
- Mom?
- What's going on over there?
- Ooh, naked bitches!
How come you didn't pick up the home
phone? I've been trying to reach you.
-
- I'm sorry, we've been outside, but I can...
- Crystal, spin around!
- ..I can go get them.
No, that's OK.
Oh, my God!
What?
Oh, nothing, nothing. It's just the kids,
they just pitched the tent outside and I...
It's really nice to see them...
to see them playing with each other.
- Put your ass on the glass!
- Put your ass on the glass, yeah!
Your chocha!
Jake, is someone there with you?
No, no, no, it's just the kids out on the lake,
it's crazy here. You know how it is.
Honey, I do not want Zane or Laura
near the lake today, do you hear me?
All right, OK, we'll stay in,
we'll watch some TV, whatever's on, OK?
All right, I gotta go.
Thank you so much for this.
I'll try really hard to be home early, OK?
Yeah, all right, all right, I love you.
OK, I gotta go.
Kelly?
Kelly, where are you?
Kelly?
Kelly, where are you?
Kelly?

- Jake!
You just missed the rest of the big show.
There you go, girls, come on up,
give 'em some towels.
Wow, good work.
Way to tie off a canoe.
I must have gotten my knots mixed up.
So, you catch zero fish
and you lose our only boat.
This day is just full of accomplishments.
Jake is gonna kill us.
Somebody will see us. Look, there's
some boats just right over there.
Don't waste your time.
They'll never see us, they're way too far.
Hello!
Hey!
Hello!
Hey! Help!
We need some help!
Hey, we're over here!
Somebody please help us!
Please! Help!
Help!
Hey, we need help!
Please!
Please! Help!
Hey!
Please!
Ow! Oh!
Ah!
Whoa, look at the size of that.
What is it, a cavern system?
Looks to me like a subterranean lake,
probably bigger than the one above.
Sam, can you gimme a hand over here?
- See that gap there?
- Yeah.
The quake opened that up,
now it's a connecting passage.
A lake under a lake?
That's right.
Sorry, it's still your jurisdiction.
This is part of an old volcanic ridge
all over this area.
That's the beauty of it. We're gonna
be the first ones to explore it.
I don't know why you're getting
all excited about that crap.
All we ever see is rocks and sand.
Should probably warn them
that it's not very pretty down there.
Tourists treat this lake
like it's a garbage can.
How you guys doing? Sheriff says it's
a regular treasure trove down there, so...
I got dibs on the spent bottles of Axe
body spray and back issues of Jugs.
I got dibs on home appliances.
I got dibs on missing college girls.
Oh, my God!
This is the longest one I've ever seen.
Can you keep your mind
on the task at hand?
Wow, Sam.
It's at least 200 feet, Novak.
Almost full visibility.
Descending fissure.
My PO2 is at set point 1 .3.
You should see this,
it's unbelievable.
Novak, do you copy?
Yeah, pretty good.
OK, guys, you're about 90 feet
to the entrance of the connecting passage.
Looks like single file time.
I'll go first.
No, I should do the prelim scout.
Your fat ass will get us stuck.
Baby, I'm like an eel, an electric eel.
I get into such tight spaces
it's shocking.
-
- Huh, that's weird.
Here they are, but they're splitting up.
Guys, everything all right?
I'm losing you a little bit here.
I'm hitting a serious drop in
temperature. It's at least 30 degrees colder.
You're probably at the mouth
of the underwater lake.
Do you have any visual?
I'm entering the cave.
Jesus, this thing seems endless!
You gotta see this.
This is incredible.
Fuck!
What are you seeing down there?
Sam?
Something bit me!
Oh, yeah, right. I thought
you always liked that kind of stuff.
- Sam? Sam?
-
- Answer me! Sam?
-
Sam!
Something's happening.
- An aftershock?
- I don't know. Get me my flippers.
Fucking swim!
Oh no!
Fucking swim! No!
No!

Get him out!

You don't wanna worship
at this beautiful altar?
I know you're partial to the champagne,
but, believe us, you can trust Crystal, right.
- Come on, Derrick, she said no.
- No, she said "no, thanks".
There's a difference. She understands
gratitude is the right attitude.
Kelly, Kelly, trust us, it's never cheating
if it's with another chick.
- Come on!
- Have fun, do it. Everyone's doin' it.
- You're not trying to take away her fun?

this thing is doing in my lake.
Where did you get this?
ln the middle of the lake,
where there are two people dead.
Oh!
- Oh my!
- Oh my, that's right, oh my, oh my!
Excuse me,
but...is that a fucking piranha?
- Carl?
- It's not the only one.
Here, look at this.
There are thousands of 'em.
Thousands. And they're pissed.
Ive heard of this happening.
It's like those baby alligators in New Jersey,
- someone leaves them, then they breed.
- What?
- No one released this fish into the lake.
- What are you talking about?
This particular piranha
vanished off the face of the earth
more than two million years ago.
Where's he going?
Oh.
Allow me to introduce you...
..to pygocentrus nattereri,
the original piranha.
They used to swim the Colorado River
right up until the Pleistocene Epoch.
I still don't understand
how you found one...
..alive.
We discovered a subterranean lake
through a rift caused by the quake.
But, how could it have survived for so long
cut off from the surface?
Cannibalism.
They must have fought each other
to survive. Look.
All the scars on his scales.
Notice...the eyes.
Jesus, it's like he's staring back at you.
Oh, no, no, no, no, not staring.
Sensing.
- Oh God!
- God, don't do that!
Piranha hunt in packs,
not for protection,
but for overwhelming force.
They're organised, methodical.
The first bite draws blood.
The blood draws the pack.
So, how are we going to stop them?
You're not actually considering
going back out onto the lake?
They're killing machines but they're still fish,
you can catch them or kill them.
- But if there really are thousands...
- Yeah?
..yesterday would have been
a good time to start.
-
- Whoo!
Yeah!

- Careful, it's not that deep.
We're busted.
OK, Jake, I'm not taking the fall for this,

How about 40 and we call it even?
How about you get on this boat
and we go home, end of story?
- Just get on the boat!
- Whoa, whoa.
We should have been at Canyon Beach
an hour ago,

- All right, go ahead, Speedo!
Be careful getting out of here,
the rocks sometimes strip away the engine.
I want you to rest down here, OK?
Keep Zane and Laura with you.
I don't want them anywhere near...
Wow, the water's just so clear.
What kinda fish was that?
I don't know.
I'm gonna make 'em take us home

Are you guys OK?
I think we hit something.
Andrew!
Andrew, what the hell is going on now?

What happened?
There's something caught on the prop.
- Stay put.
- All right.
Crystal, get the sand rat up here.
I said, get the fucking sand rat up here!
Are you retarded?
Why didn't you go get him yourself?
I'm just out here thinking how this whole
fucked-up day has been your fault.
You won't help me with the new bitch.
You don't do a fucking thing I tell you.
You take us way the fuck off course!

I'm cool with that, man. Really, I am,
but what you're doing to me...
what this is...
God, there's a word for it.
It's uh... It's uh...
It's a boat word. What is it? Uh...
Mutiny.
Is that what this is? Is this a mutiny?
Look, relax, Derrick, OK, I'm just...
Im just going a little wild.
Derrick!
If anyone should be down there helping,
it ought to be you.
Let me do that, let me do that!
Come on, let me do it.

You're gonna be all right! Look at me!

Hold this tight.
This is Sheriff Forester.
- Mom?
- Jake!
Im so sorry, I screwed up,
we're on the lake.
What? Where are Laura and Zane?
They're with me on the boat.
Oh, my God, Jake! Whatever you do,
do not go into the water.
You don't understand, Mom,
our boat is sinking.
What?
Where are you?
What are you doing?
I'm coming with you.
Let's go.
That's Mom.
Mom! Hey!
- They're stuck in the rocks.
- Yeah.
- How we gonna get the boat close?
- I don't know.
The rope.
Here, you think it'll reach?
It's got to. Jake! I'm gonna throw you
the rope, attach it to the highest railing.
OK, Mom.
- Back it up.
- Yeah.
Back it up this way.
Watch out for the rocks.
Watch out!
Are you ready?
Yeah.
That's good, don't come too far.
Yeah!
Shit! Shit!
Keep the CB on the police frequency.
Ive got my radio.
OK, just get there.
Mom! Mom!
Mom, are you OK?
I'm sorry.
Is this everybody on the boat?
No, Kelly's still stuck in the cabin.
We can't get her out.
- What? Oh, God! Kelly?
- We can't get her out!
Oh! Julie!
Oh, I'm gonna die!
- You gotta help me!
- Can you grab my arm?
Help me! The water's getting higher!
- Can you reach the skylight?
- It doesn't matter, it's fucking stuck!
- You think I didn't try to pry it up?
- God damn it!
Jake! You guys! I'm scared!
Please help!
Mom, we have to hurry!
Kelly? Kelly!
Are we all gonna die?
We're not gonna die.
Ah! Fuck!
I need your help! Please! Jake!
The only way to get to her is through
the bottom of the boat. Get to the rope.
What are you talking about?
We can't leave her down there.
Once I get everyone across on the rope,
Im gonna come back for her.
I'm not gonna leave without her, Mom!
The only way to get to her is for you to get
into the water. I'm not gonna let you do that.
Get on the rope!
The reason she came on this boat
was because of me.
It's my fault.
I'm not gonna leave without her.
This rope's not gonna hold
much longer, let's go!
I'm gonna take Zane and Laura across
and then I'm coming back,
- and we are gonna do it together.
- All right.
We're gonna keep the two little ones
between us. You're gonna go first.
Can you do this?
You better believe it.
I don't pole dance for nothing.
You have a lot of explaining to do.
You ready?
OK, be careful!
Don't look down! Let's go!
- Hold on tight, Laura.
- Mom!
Oh!
Right, just like at the playground, guys -
hand over hand.
Don't look down.
- Don't look down, all right?
- You guys are doing great.
Mom!
Keep going, come on, you can do it.
Hand over hand.
I'm scared!
-  Do not look down.
- Mom!
Keep going!
Careful!
Don't look down, OK? Hold on!
Come on, guys, you can do this!
Don't look down!
It bit me!
Go back! Go back!
Get off me! Get off me!
Get off!
I'm bleeding, I'm bleeding!
Get off!
No, no, no!
God damn it!
Laura, listen to me.
Listen to me, both of you.
lf you move fast,
they will not get you.
You have to move now!
Come on, move it! You can do it. Go!
Keep going now!
Mom!
- Mom!
- Mom!
Keep going!
OK, guys. Guys, you're here.
Oh, you guys did it!
Damn it!
Oh!
Come on, Mom, keep moving!
You OK?
Cut the engine!
What are you doing?
Jake, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
Jake!
Jake, do not do that.
Piranha want blood, right?
Let's give it to 'em.
Argh!
Wet t-shirt.
What the hell am I doing?
Jake!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
We're getting out of here, both of us.
OK, I'm in. I need you guys to pull us out
as fast as possible. Do you copy?
OK, we're ready when you are.
OK.
Jake, what are you doing?
They're gonna come back.
No, I gave 'em a snack. That's gonna hold
'em off for at least a couple of minutes.
OK, yes, yes! OK.
- I need you to tie these together.
- Why?
- Just do it!
- Jake, where you going?
Jake?
- OK.
- Oh, my God.
You have them tied?
Come on.
OK...
I need you to hold your breath,
and we're gonna swim out
through the bottom of the boat, OK?
I need you to hold on tight.
Can you hold on tight to me?
All right.
You're clear to pull us out in ten seconds,
OK? Do you guys copy?
Copy that.
Ten seconds on your signal.
Get the kids down.
Ten.
Six, five,
four, three,
two, one.
- Um...
- What's wrong?
- Come on!
- I'll check the prop.
- It's clear. Is it in gear?
- God damn it!
No. Come on!
Come on, fucking thing!
Come on! It's gotta work, it's gotta work!
Come on!
-
-
Oh, my God!
Holy shit!
- Jake!
- Kelly!
Are you all right?
Kick your legs, come on!
- Oh, God!
- Come on!
Come on, you're all right, you're all right.
Breathe, you're OK.
- You're OK.
-
You're OK, you're OK. Oh, my God!
Glad to have you onboard.
Jesus Christ.
- I'm sorry, Mom. I'm so sorry.
- Holy shit!
Look, Mom, over there.
My God!
They're all dead.
You did it, Jake.
I did. It worked.
I thought dynamite fishing was illegal
in these parts, sheriff.
Sheriff? Sheriff?
Yeah, this is Julie.
Julie, this is Carl.
We have a major problem.
Im looking out
at a school of dead piranha.
It's not all of them,
but I think we've got a good start.
You don't understand.
The specimen you left with me,
it has no mature reproductive organs.
- What?
- What are you talking about?
The piranhas that killed those divers,
the ones you're hunting for,
they're not fully developed.
They're the babies.
The babies?
Ah!
So, where are the parents?
