"1959 Hong Kong"
"Ip Man's older son was studying in Foshan."
"Ip Man lived in Hong Kong with his wife and younger son."
"He taught Wing Chun and promoted the martial arts."
Master Ip.
Morning!
So early?
I'm back, Master Ip.
You don't recognize me?
Siu Long.
I came to you as a kid,
I wanted to learn to fight.
You said I was still too young.
And now you think
you're all grown up?
I will become your greatest disciple.
What makes you so certain?
Because I'm fast.
How fast?
I thought you said you were fast?
Let's speed things up.
Not bad.
I admit you're pretty fast but
you still have much to learn.
Come on, somebody's fighting.
Fight! Fight!
Cheung Fong of Wing Chun.
Ip Ching of Wing Chun.
Stop! Stop fighting.
I told you two not to fight.
Break the shell, then remove the yolk.
What do you need the ring for?
Its not the ring, its the silver.
They say it helps with the bruising.
So, what was the fight about anyway?
The usual, who has the best kung fu.
I'm sorry I wasn't watching them.
Someone really could of gotten hurt.
It's Ching's fault. He's so naughty.
So, where is this boy's father?
Cheung Fong is new here.
His dad picks him up quite late.
Fong, what does your dad do?
Is he always so busy?
Rickshaw puller.
Sorry, sorry.
- Sorry, Miss Wong.
- Master Ip.
I was busy at the kung
fu school so I'm late.
Let me see.
Ah Ching, what's this about?
Both kids were at fault in fact.
So I wanted all the family heads here.
Right. Is Fong's dad here yet?
I need to apologize to them.
No, like you, he's late.
No problem, work comes first.
- Don't eat that. Put it down.
- You can't eat it.
The boy is hungry.
Miss Wong, how about this -
we'll give them dinner first.
Just let his father know,
- Okay?
- Okay.
Okay, Wing-sing?
Of course
Fong, have dinner with us, okay?
Take your book bag.
- Take care.
- We're off.
Thank you.
- Very kind, Master Ip.
- Sorry to trouble you,
- Thank you, Mrs. Ip.
- Bye
Bye
Ah Fong, eat up, don't be shy.
Yeah, Fong!
Make yourself at home, eat.
Eat up.
Darling, the fish is delicious.
Cheung Fong... not bad.
Who taught you?
My dad. Can you fight?
A little.
I'm Cheung Fong's dad.
Is my son there, please?
Yes he is.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Cheung.
Please, come in.
Fong, your dad's here.
Master.
Disciple.
Tell me what went on today.
The kids were naughty and fought.
They'll learn in time.
Come here, Ah Ching.
Disciple.
- Aren't you going to apologize?
- Ah Ching is at fault too.
Ip Ching, I’m sorry.
I'm sorry, Cheung Fong.
Shake hands.
Now you're friends.
I've taken you out of your way.
I apologize, Mr. Cheung.
Good to meet you, Master Ip.
I saw Fong working the wooden man.
He's good, he's been taught well.
Too kind.
But it's late. You should rest.
I'll see you off.
Master.
Uncle Ip has a wooden man too.
Do you know him?
Yes.
Uncle Ip is very famous.
But one day
I'll be more famous.
Which of you is better at kung fu?
Who do you think?
You of course!
Let's go.
Give me a look... does it hurt?
No
It's about to start. Hurry! Hurry!
Bet on the winner.
- I told you, follow my lead.
- Great.
One at a time!
Bigger bets, bigger wins.
Move, outta the way.
Cheung Tin Chi, Cheung Tin Chi.
How are you doing?
Come on, come on.
Brother Sang, Brother Sang.
- The boss is here.
- What?
The boss is here.
Not bad, kid. Go.
Hit hard, fast.
Hey boss.
Come on.
- Wait here, I'll be right back.
- Okay.
Boss -
don't worry,
I've got it under control.
Two week's cash.
Counted the payments personally.
The school?
Two weeks.
C'mon...
What kind of kung fu is that?
Wing Chun.
It's really powerful.
This place is popular with
the local kung fu masters.
They all have tables.
That's Master Chan and all
these are his students.
Master Tin.
- Master Chan, a rising star -
- Master Tin.
he has a lot of students.
Master Chan.
Now this table is amazing,
the best of the best.
It's my table.
Master Tin.
Just kidding.
The real champions sit there.
That's the Wing Chun table.
Master Tin.
Ah Lik, where's your master?
There he is.
Master Ip.
- Master Tin, have you eaten?
- No, your treat?
Of course!
You know Master Ip, of course?
- Master Ip, hello. I'm Lee.
- How do you do.
- Mr. Lee.
- Hello.
Lee is a reporter, and keen
to write about the martial arts.
He'll take photos too.
- Great.
- Okay with you, Master Ip?
- Of course.
- Thank you so much.
- Master Lee, right here.
- Too kind.
- Ip Man, the center seat.
- No, no.
- It's yours.
- No, really.
No it's fitting, sit down.
Master Ip, telephone.
I'll take that if it's okay.
Sure...
we'll save your seat. We'll wait.
Hello?
Did you forget our date?
The one next week...
It was today.
I can't believe that I...
Oh, I'll rush right over.
I've been waiting an hour.
The dancing is almost finished.
So don't bother.
Just pick up Ah Ching from school.
I'm in trouble.
- Master Ip, please.
- Sit down.
Here, the middle seat.
- Okay, I give in.
- And why not.
Look sharp, eyes front, hold still!
Ready...
One, two, three.
Master Ip,
- Hello.
- you're here for your son?
Where's your wife?
She's busy today.
And you're not?
It's okay...
Master Ip, you look younger by the day.
Must be his wife's cooking...
such tender meat.
Such a lucky couple.
Master Ip.
Mr. Cheung...
- hello.
- Hello.
- Picking up your son?
- Yes.
Oh,
this medicine helps with bruises.
It's for your son.
Thank you, that's so nice.
How is Fong?
- He's fine.
- I'm glad.
Master Ip...
I hear you studied with
Chan Wah Shun, yes?
Yes.
So we're both from the school of
Foshan's Grandmaster Leung Jan.
I guess that makes us
brothers-in-arms then.
I heard that Chan focused on the
fist and pole, not swords and feet.
Is that true?
Strengths and weaknesses,
like any teacher...
It's a normal thing.
How about you, Master Ip?
I have a few.
If we have the chance,
I'd love to spar.
Sure.
Bye, Miss!
Be careful.
Master.
Disciple.
What did you learn today?
- Mathematics.
- Mathematics?
Chinese, English.
- How'd you do? Did you behave?
- That's all. Yes.
You ever go to school?
Nup.
Principal...
this man is asking for you.
How may I help you?
- Hey
- Move it!
- What's going on?
- Sit, don't move.
- Don't move.
- Looking at me?
Fatty, calm down!
How can I talk over your noise?
So sorry, sir, we gave you a fright.
- What's going on?
- Come, sit down. Make room.
Don't be afraid.
You're a scholar, I’m a gentleman.
We're reasonable people.
Your school here is
prime real estate.
And you're going to sell it
to me for a very fair price.
"Contract of Sale"
But it's not for sale.
Won't you even read it first? Go on.
I'm not selling.
Educated people are a pain.
They don't do as told.
Watch out, Boss.
What's going on?
They're forcing me to sell the school.
Think I don't know kung fu?
Ip Man, it's a business deal...
keep your damn nose out of it.
Hello, this is Chi yan Primary School.
We need police here right now.
Some thugs are causing trouble.
- Cut it out.
- Let him go.
Let my boss go...
or I'll whack her.
- Let my boss go, now!
- Let him go.
- Do it!
- Let him go
Don't rush, take your time.
Start from the beginning.
The three just barged in and
began smashing things up.
Master Ip, Hong Kong seems
prosperous but really it's a mess.
More wealth means more crime.
Meanwhile, my force's understaffed. We
can't keep our eyes on the entire city.
It's absurd.
There's only so much we can do.
You're right
As Hong Kong's crime rate goes up...
people feel helpless.
Well sure, but we do what
we can to keep the peace.
If you call us, we will come.
We'll crack this case.
The bastards won't get away with it.
Yes, yes.
We're relying on you, Sgt. Po.
Of course, it's my duty.
But Master Ip, you know the score.
The police can't keep
watch here all day.
We need your help.
Tell people to be careful.
- I will.
- Anything happens, call us.
- I'll come straightaway. Okay?
- Great, thank you.
- You're welcome. Let's go, men.
- Yes, sir.
- See you.
- Take care.
Bye.
Ip Man,
you piss me off.
I'm gonna do you slowly.
- David.
- Brother Sang.
Chain up the school tonight.
Don't worry. It'll be okay.
It's okay.
Don't worry...
the school won't shut.
Principal!
Principal!
- Miss Wong.
- Master Ip.
- Miss Wong...
- Master Ip.
what's going on?
It was like this when I got here.
Will they demolish the school?
How will our kids get an education?
Dad, open the gate.
I'll help you, careful.
You're really strong.
Can't I be skinny and strong?
Sure.
I'm big but not that strong.
My name is Hui Lik.
They call me Miss Wong.
Call me if you need help.
- Come in,
- Morning, granny.
Morning, Principal.
Morning, Miss Wong.
Morning.
Master.
Let's go!
They'll be back for sure.
Then wait here for them.
Okay.
Tonight we're staying here.
Good.
Miss Wong, funny meeting you again.
- Yes, can I help you?
- No.
May I ask, do you have a boyfriend?
No.
Great.
Would you like a boyfriend?
Haven't thought about it.
Don't get me wrong... but it's dark.
You shouldn't walk home alone.
I'm sorry.
Master Ip.
Hello, Miss Wong.
We've put you to a lot of trouble.
It's nothing.
Is my disciple giving you trouble?
No, Master Ip.
Not at all.
He kindly offered to see me home.
That's all it was, Master.
Why don't you see me home then?
Okay.
Hey,
let's see Master Ip home tonight.
Sure, it's pretty quiet.
Okay.
Master Ip, you did a lot for us today.
You should get some rest.
I'm fine.
I didn't have any other plans.
Hey!
Hurry!
Go take that side!
- Help, Master Ip!
- Take him.
- Help!
- Protect Miss Wong!
Okay?
Yup, but we can still work-
- Behind me!
- Okay.
Help!
Move.
Let's go, men.
We checked everywhere.
The fire's out.
Make sure there's no live embers.
Okay.
- Go double-check.
- Okay.
Master,
the fire's extinguished.
But nothing's left but ash.
Principal,
are you okay?
I'm fine.
But I underestimated those thugs.
Lucky you and your men were here.
- It was nothing.
- Thank you so much, Master Ip.
Mr. Cheung,
thank goodness you were there.
I was just passing by.
I've finally seen your Wing Chun.
It's as good as they say.
You're too nice.
If all's well,
I'll get back to work.
Bye.
The people want me to stay
and help guard the area.
It's arson, aren't the cops involved?
Yes, why wouldn't they be?
'Fatty' Po says they'll crack the case.
We've no reason to doubt his word.
That's good.
But they can't give 24-hour protection.
So...
for a few nights,
I might be out late.
Should I cook dinner then?
Sure,
what'll I eat otherwise?
They can't do it without you?
It's not that.
But if I can help, I will.
It's working.
Then do me a favour, turn it off.
So sorry, so sorry...
I was having dinner.
Come in, have a look.
Come, have a look.
The place has great Feng Shui.
It's an oasis of calm.
So the wall's a bit chipped,
you can sweep it clean.
Disciple.
I'll open my kung fu school here.
You'll have lots of classmates then.
Is that good?
Great! I'll be able to practice
here and here and here!
How much is a month's rent?
HK$180. Water and electricity included.
I'll think it over. Thank you.
Sir, the rent is negotiable.
You pull a rickshaw?!
And you're going to run a school? As if!
- You're wasting my time.
- Where to, boss?
Home.
Sir, my report on the school arson case.
Then wait here for them.
Sign and I'll follow up.
Not necessary. I think I’m
going to handle this one.
Don't be silly, it's a small case.
Too small for you, sir.
Let me handle it, okay?
You must not have heard me.
Yes, sir.
What the hell! You blind?!
You shouldn't be there?
Get out the street!
Idiot!
- Here comes more.
- I'll kill you!
Brother.
Thanks.
Brother.
When I was at tea this morning, people
were saying we'd become security guards.
Oh, don't worry about it.
Master Ip says to ignore gossip.
Who said it anyway?
Lots of people.
Would you recognize them?
Tell me.
How can I help you?
I often have pain in my abdomen.
Do you have anything for it?
Yes.
Crow And Phoenix Pills.
They help circulate.
Okay, I'll have a packet.
- Ip Man.
- Hi.
- Why didn't you tell me what happened?
- Master Tin, have a seat.
Have a seat.
They're saying at the teahouse
you've become a security guard.
That's so insulting.
- I bet it's that little bastard's doing.
- Have some tea.
I rue the day I made Ah Sang a disciple.
He uses my kung fu to do awful things.
It's disgraceful!
He shames my school!
See, that is why I kept you out of it.
Well I'm in it now!
I'm going to make that
ratface pay for this!
One final lesson!
Master Tin.
Master Tin, calm down.
Uncle Chan, I'll pay for this.
Master Tin!
Master Tin.
Let Sgt. Po handle it.
It's too late for that.
I'll take care of this myself.
That little shit owes me respect.
He's no longer your responsibility.
It's true that he left my school...
but I'm still his teacher.
Don't fret, I'll be fine.
Stop. What d'ya want?
I'm looking for Ma King Sang.
I'm his master. Call him out.
Sgt. Po.
Ah-Lik, where's Master Ip?
Too late for that.
Master Tin threw a fit
and he went after him.
Master Tin?
Oh great, here we go...
Why are you here, Master Ip?
Why are you butting in on my
reunion with my old teacher?
Master.
Sang!
Leave Master Ip out of this!
This is between me and you!
Stop causing so much trouble.
Leave those people alone, give it up.
I always taught you
to do the right thing.
Look at yourself.
Flashing your dirty money...
surrounding by thugs.
You're really something, aren’t you?
But what do you really have?
Think about it, if you didn't pay them,
would they still be there?
When you're around, they bow and scrape.
Behind your back,
they call you the foreign devil's flunkey.
What? You want to fight me?
So I'm a flunkey...
well this flunkey has money...
and money's what matters out there!
Now what are you?!
A down-on-his-luck teacher who repairs
umbrellas just to scrap by...
Do you honestly like that?!
You can't eat ideals!
Ask yourself, does anyone notice?!
Your students won't remember you!
Your students won't take care of you!
They all work for me now!
That's your life's work!
You have nothing now...
this flunky took it all away-
Bastard!
You'd stab me?!
You thug! You want to kill me?
Hurt me again and you
won't leave here alive!
Men, over here!
- Free Ah Sang!
- Don't worry about me.
Kill them both!
Fight, brothers!
C'mon!
Free Ah Sang!
Police, stop it!
Get back, get back!
Get back!
Go home!
Move and I'll shoot!
Are you kidding? Take a hike!
Get out!
Is that an order?
I must have misheard you?
Know who owns this place?!
Go ahead and shoot me.
Pull the trigger!
What'll you tell your captain then?
You wanna talk about your
boss and what he wants?
How 'bout I just seal
this whole place off?!
Now then, you still wanna play!
What'll you do about the school?
My captain is in their boss's pocket.
It doesn't matter what we do,
the damn school is still doomed.
I'm afraid it's a lost cause.
Fatty, I trust you...
You're a good police man
and a faithful friend...
But one word from a foreigner
and you drop the case?
It's not that, it's pointless.
But you didn't arrest the arsonist.
You say you can't help he
teachers or the children.
My students watch the place.
We're doing your job for you.
What else can I do?!
Master Ip, you're a martial
artist, not a god.
You can try to guard the school day and
night but how long can you keep that up?
You know Hong Kong is
run by foreigners.
Life isn't fair.
But that doesn't mean we can
just ignore right and wrong.
The rulers maybe strong,
the subjects maybe weak.
But the future doesn't
belong to the rich.
And it doesn't belong
to the powerful either.
It belongs to our children.
And perhaps the pure of heart.
Have you thought of the children?
All of the things we do,
they watch and learn from.
We sacrifice.
It isn't fun and it isn't easy.
It's necessary.
not for today...
but for tomorrow.
"Toss it if you don't want it."
"Please sew on the button."
"Please sew on the button."
Mrs. Ip, my initial diagnosis
is to suspect a tumor.
It's not very encouraging.
But we’ll learn more once
we have the full report.
Try not to worry too much.
Master Ip. You work so hard.
Master Ip, We all pitched in for the soup.
- Enjoy it.
- Thank you.
You're here night and day.
You need sustenance.
Where are your disciples?
They should have some too.
Thank you, thank you.
I had told you the blue one is better,
but you still buy the red one.
Another big win.
You get paid. Come right back.
Man's gotta eat.
I get it.
it's like that time at the school
were you beat up my men, remember?
That cost me big time.
How much do I owe?
It's not like that.
I like you.
I wanna be your friend.
Sang, what's this about?
I'm talking about the kind of friendship
that pushes another man to the wall.
I'm buying a man's hand here.
You've so many men...
why do you need me?
Because he knows kung fu...
you know kung fu.
Be my champion.
And if I say no?
Then don't come back here.
The blue? Hand it over.
You won? Give it here.
Ah Sang...
I'll do it for that... all of it.
How many more days of this?
You're awake?
I didn't want to wake you.
Just a few more days.
When will you eat at home again?
Tonight.
I'll come back earlier.
Are you okay?
Well...
- Hello
- Hello? Master Ip?
Yes, who's this?
Kowloon Hospital.
What is it?
Master Tin was wounded in an assault.
He asked to see you.
Okay, I'll be right there.
He's on his way.
Thank you.
Let's get to work.
Very good.
Go play.
Thank you.
Ah Sang sent him for sure.
As a teacher, I'm a total failure.
- Let's get some!
- Yes, this one!
Kids,
I have some cartoon slides,
want to see them?
It's free.
C'mon.
Hey!
- Hurry!
- What're you doing?
- Help, help
- Help me
Hey!
Take him!
What're you doing?
- Enjoy.
- Help me.
You've got two hours.
Get the principal to the shipyard
or I sell the kids into slavery.
How'd you know I was in hospital?
You told them to call me.
- No I didn't.
- You didn't?
Mrs. Ip, where's Master Ip?
What is it?
Tell me what happened?
Master Ip!
- What is it, Miss Wong?
- Master!
A man came and took several
kinds including Ching and Fong.
What?
If the principal doesn't go to see him,
he'll sell the children into slavery.
Tell Sgt. Po and find the principal!
Great.
I asked for the principal
and you bring me a stick.
Just great.
Is he coming?
Yes, he's on his way.
But first, free the kids.
Now.
Dad, Dad!
Shut up!
Son, don't be afraid.
I'm here.
Ah, so this is your son?
Lucky me. I was hoping to get him.
Let him out.
Stand straight.
Shush.
Calm down.
Come here, kid.
Ah Sang,
this is between us.
Leave them out of this, okay?
Everything is fine...
I'm just giving him
a bite of my apple.
Don't be afraid, have some apple.
Just...
tell Dad to put down the pole.
Then we can talk.
Ching, don't be afraid.
Put down the pole!
Now on your knees.
Now!
Kowtow!
Master Ip?
Hey...
What're you doing here?
There's no fight today.
You took my boy.
Papa! Master!
Help me!
Ah Fong...
So he's your boy...?
Sorry. He's one of ours. Let him go.
Lucky it was me who took him.
Anything could've happened.
Leave it alone. Go!
Ip Man,
the famous martial artist.
I feel a little generous.
I'll let you take on ten of my best men.
One against ten...
or eleven.
And with every punch you land...
I'll give him a piece to eat.
Master, they still have my friends.
Why are you back?
To pick up the kids from school.
Bastard.
Move.
Over here.
Get him!
Another step and I'll kill him.
Dad!
Bite him.
What the...?!
Go!
Grab the kid, hurry.
Over there, quick!
Dad!
Dad! Dad!
David, don't just stand there!
Grab that kid.
Dad!
Kneel. Don't move.
Kneel.
Don't move.
Kneel.
- Hear me?
- I'm not with them.
Don't move! No one move!
Police. Don't move!
No one move!
Go in and take photos.
Don't move!
All those guys over there.
They'll make great news photos.
Great headline material.
Get 'em all.
I said don't move!
Mama.
- Mama!
- Ah Ching!
There was trouble at the school.
They abducted Ah Ching.
I'm so sorry, Wing Sing.
It's my fault.
I was wrong.
It's my fault.
It won't happen again,
okay?
Go wash your face.
Okay.
Good boy.
It's all my fault.
Don't cry.
Darling, I’m so afraid.
It's all right now.
But I might not be.
What do you mean?
The doctor said...
I probably...
have cancer.
The black spots indicate cancer cells.
These are tumors.
The cancer has spread too widely
for us to be able to operate.
Is it curable?
Normally, we'd prescribe medicines...
but at this stage,
they're unlikely to get it under control.
Doctor, how much time do I have?
Maybe six months.
I'll get you more rice.
Just half.
This Thai guy's incredible.
He's all kness and elbows. It's so cool.
I just meant to give the principal a scare,
not to create such a mess.
It's all Ip man's fault. I'm sorry.
Fuck off!
Finish him off!
Get out!
Want any tea?
Listen, I'm not expecting
anymore trouble.
Things seemed to have quieted down.
But...
the foreigners still run things.
And Ah Sang's boss is a powerful man.
You need to watch your back.
Be careful.
Look at you.
Mom, look!
If you want something, I’m here.
What do you want?
Interesting.
So fast, you're invincible.
Three minutes.
You get a clean slate with me.
I want my balloon back.
Madame...
here's my rent.
I always said you'd come good!
Best of luck! You'll be raking it in!
Great! I can practice Wing Chun here!
Master...
respect!
Respect!
Sir, you teach Wing Chun?
You must know Ip Man, yes?
Look, today's newspaper,
he's in the news.
He's so impressive.
I bet you two are great friends.
Introduce me sometime.
Here's the key. I'll leave you.
Don't forget to introduce me!
Excuse me, did you write this?
"WING CHUN'S IP MAN HELPS
POLICE RESCUE CHILDREN"
Yes.
I am Cheung Tin Chi.
I teach Wing Chun.
I was thinking you could write about me?
I've seen Ip Man's kung fu,
it's not authentic Wing Chun.
I'm going to challenge him.
All the kung fu schools
respect Ip Man's Wing Chun.
Sure, I can write something.
But I can't tell people what to think.
They would only accept a qualified Wing
Chun master to publicly challenge Ip Man.
Have a seat, Master.
Got your camera?
Tea's nice today.
Cheung of Wing Chun. A friendly match?
Who do you think-?
"CHEUNG TIN CHI BURSTS
ONTO KUNG FU SCENE"
"WING CHUN TRIUMPHANT
CHEUNG TIN CHI'S FAME SPREADS"
"NEW KUNG FU KING: CHEUNG TIN CHI"
Now... am I qualified?
Yeah.
Master Cheung is coming.
Congratulation, Master Cheung.
Eyes front, please.
Mr. Wong, thanks you for your support.
I admire a fighter with
guts and ambition.
If I can be of help, just say the word.
Thank you.
Master Cheung,
you're fighting every
master in the city,
you bring photographers.
What do you think that
does for your image?
Listen,
I know what people say.
They think I'm a violent show-off,
that I'm pretentious.
But this is kung fu...
we've made a tradition
of knowing who's best!
And so it must be said...
Ip Man...
disgraces Wing Chun.
Gentlemen...
I hereby announce...
that challenging Ip Man to a fight!
"Grandmaster of Wing Chun"
Extra, extra!
Wing Chun vs. Wing Chun!
- Get your paper.
- I'll have one.
"CHEUNG TIN CHI CHALLENGES IP MAN"
"WHOSE IS THE TRUE WING CHUN?"
Darling, this one's funny.
Ah Mo decided to go out to
dinner with some friends.
He's like "We're all so
henpecked, you know?"
"If you don't believe me, I can prove it.
Look, watch this."
"If your wife wears the pants
at home, go sit over there."
So all the men but Ah mo go over to the
other table with their heads hung low.
And they all say,
"Oh wow, you must really
be the man, Ah Mo?"
But Ah Mo just shakes his head and says,
"No, my wife just warned me not
to sit at crowded places."
Funny, right?
Are you scared of your wife?
Sometimes.
Next.
Are you Cheung Wing Sing?
Why'd God make women
both pretty and foolish?
They made them pretty...
so that men would love them.
But he made them stupid...
so that they would love men.
- Look, someone's challenging Ip Man!
- They'll fight on the 15th.
Harder.
Relax the shoulders.
This way, Master Cheung.
I want to sit there.
"Master Ip"
Excuse me.
Master Ip, what're you doing here?
I'm looking for Mr. Chan.
You want to learn to dance?
I dance better than him.
I'll teach you.
And you can teach me kung fu.
Sure. Now?
Okay.
When will you accept me as a disciple?
You got it all wrong.
I didn't say I wouldn't accept you.
I didn't open the door
so you'd leave.
Thank you.
Welcome.
Wing Chun vs. Wing Chun:
who's the real deal?
It's an historic day for Wing Chun.
It will be like a battle of dragons!
Yes! Is Ip Man the greater fighter?
Or is Cheung Tin Chi fiercer still?
Who represents the true Wing Chun?
Today at 3:00 P.M.
the contest will begin.
We wait with bated breath.
Sgt. Po, Sgt. Po!
- Brother
- Master Tin
- Ah-Lik
- Where's Master Ip?
No idea!
What's the problem?
Maybe he's lost?
Relax, Ip Man won't let us down.
I'm here.
It's 3:00p.m. Why isn't Ip Man here?
It's time.
Look, it's three.
Where's your master?
Gentlemen...
the match was scheduled for 3:00p.m.
Since Ip Man has failed to show up,
I hereby announce...
the victor and one true
spirit of Wing Chun is...
Cheung Tin Chi.
Dad! Dad! We won! We won!
Maybe he's stuck in traffic?
And this makes you a grandmaster?
Master Cheung, what are your
thoughts of Ip Man's no-show?
He tampered with classing Wing Chun.
That's an insult.
He disgraced our forefathers.
It's wrong and it will always be wrong.
It's wrong today and will
still be wrong in the future.
I believe Master Ip understands this.
He chose to forfeit the fight...
in a deserved act of penance.
From today,
I, Cheung Tin Chi
will lead the true Wing Chun...
to a glorious future.
- Bravo.
- True Wing Chun.
What'd you say?
You've no right to that claim!
You aren't qualified to fight my master!
- Settle down, stop.
- Stop.
Wing Sing! Wing Sing!
Please, someone call an ambulance!
Mr. Ip, her condition is worsening.
She needs to stay in hospital for a bit.
Well? Feeling any better?
When can we go home?
The doctor said it's better
for you to stay here.
You need rest.

Give the letter to Cheung Fong.
Tell him to give it to his dad.
Okay.
Nurse, nurse!
What it is it, madam?
Are you in pain?
Don't worry, I'll get the doctor.
Have some bullfrog soup...
it's good for you.
Darling...
I want a photograph with you.
You spend every day with me.
It makes me so happy.
But I could be happier.
People say:
Life belongs to you, and it doesn't.
I didn't get it before.
But now, I'm beginning to.
You belong to yourself.
And to this family.
But to this place as well.
There are things you should do.
I don't want you to have regrets.
I only regret not being better to you.
But I think you've been great to me.
If it wasn't for my sickness,
would you have taken the challenge?
Yes.
That's the Ip Man I love.
I've taken the liberty of
setting the date with him.
I haven't heard you practice in ages.
Will you let me hear that sound again?
Wing Chun,
Cheung Tin Chi.
Wing Chun,
Ip Man.
- Ip Ching, the back way.
- Okay.
I recognize that I'm defeated.
There's nothing more important...
than the love of those by your side.
"Ip Man's wife Cheung Wing Sing
passed away in 1960 from cancer."
"Ip Man taught Ip Ching Wing Chun.
Martial arts guided his life."
"Ip Man became a Grandmaster."
"Wing Chun has flourished, generation after generation,
spreading across the world."
