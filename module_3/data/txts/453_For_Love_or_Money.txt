[ Car Horns Honking]
Buy 12 at market,
unload four at 90,
dump the rest on Friday.
Now don't burn me, Albert.
I'm on the line here.
Ten is break-even. I said 12.
Right. Nothing's impossible,
Albert. Impossible just takes
a couple extra phone calls.
- We're standing
still here, Eliot.
-Yes, Mr. Ireland.
I don't like to stand still.
Let me take over
Listen, no need
to put up a fight
I hope by now
you know I'm right
Hey
Baby
Baby

Let me take you over
Ann, let me tell you what
I need: flawless clarity,
F-color or better.
Fifteen, 20 carats.
Just what you'd want if
I were buyin' it for you.
Well, I'm rather fussy.
Cute.
A little young.
Will you show me
their parents?.
Nice.
Baby, everybody knows
Yeah

Baby, let me

All right
Morning, Mr. Ireland.
Morning, Charlie.
[ Man ]
Hello, Mr. Ireland.
Hey.
Good morning,
Mr. Ireland.
Good morning, Nora.
Good morning.
Morning.
Nice to see you, Mr. Ireland.
I won't need that giraffe
for about a half an hour.
Take it out for a walk.
Very good, sir.
Gloria, they're for you.
I hope you like them.
[ Gasps ]
They're beautiful.
Oh, thank you so much.
You like 'em, babe?.
Oh, you're a doll. You're
a great big lovable doll.
Yeah? Yeah.
Mr. Salvatore has
exquisite taste.
Here you go, Dougie. Listen, it
rained all weekend, so make sure
you give them a good workout.
I'll take care
of it myself, sir.
I have a way with animals.
Dougie, are you the guy
to talk to about them t'ings?.
Them t'ings,
Mr. Salvatore?.
Yeah, you know.
Them things on the pillow.
Uh, hair?.
Genie, get some more
of them things!
Yeah, all right!
You know, them things
on the pillow.
Initials.
Them t'ings at night!
On the pillow!
Mints! Pillow mints!
Yeah! Yeah!
Them things. We like 'em.
Yes, of course.
Why didn't I think?
Stupid. Yes.
How many would you like?
How many?
- A lot!
- A lot.
- A lot it shall be.
- You're a beautiful kid.
- Enjoy your stay
at the Bradbury.
You're a doll.
You're a doll.
No, you're a doll.
[ Barking ]
Whoa, whoa. Easy, easy.
Yo, yip. Come.
- Make sure they make!
- Right. Make.
[ Doug Grunts ]
So... you guys planning
on seeing any shows
whileyou're in town?.
[ Whining ]
[ Barking ]
All right.
Okay.
This is steak Diane.
You guys don't eat this,
I will.
You eat all that up,
you can have some ofthem
t'ings when you're done.
Come on, man.
I'm open, I'm open.
Pass! There it is!
Jump! Score!
Yes, yes!
Carmen, Carmen.
Ambulate the canines.
What?.
Take the dogs
for a walk.
Oh, of course, Mr. Ireland.
Ten dollars,
Mr. Ireland?.
Funny, I thought this was
the Bradbury, but it must be
Fat Harry's Motor Lodge.
Carmen, one day,
you're gonna be
a great concierge.
In the meantime, go get the
biggest plastic bag you can
find. And don't make fun...
of her hair.
[ Whines ]
Those things aren't candy,
Douglas.
I'm not gonna eat 'em all.
Can I get change for that?.
I'm in kind of a hurry.
Now let's see.
Fifty-eight cents
out of 100.
It's 99.42.
A whiz kid.
Let's just be sure.
Could you just--
Uh, 99.42.
Does that look right to you?.
You know, anywhere in that
ballpark is gonna be fine.
I'm not fussy.
19.42.
99.42.
[ Laughs ]
You know why I said 19.42?
You were tryin'
to cheat me out
of 80 bucks.
[ Laughing ]
I was married in 1942.
You know, I read that
in the library.
[ Laughing ]
[ Register Rings ]
I was a war bride.
- Those were horrible,
frightening days.
- The war.
No, living
with Mr. Vigusian.
[Coins Clattering]
Whoops!
just a minute.
[ Groans ]
Yes, if he hadn't fallen
off the Staten Island ferry...
Irving and I would now
be married 50 years.
I said, "Irving, get away
from the rail!"
Dougie?.
Airport?. Take the 59th
Street Bridge definitely.
Look, Ahmed, I'm rather
skeptical. It's just that
the last belly dancer...
you sent me
wasn't quite as slender
as I would have hoped.
No, the word "belly"
could have applied
to any part of her anatomy.
It's not possible.
[Doug]
Ahmed. Ahmed, you're shrieking.
- [ Mumbling ]
- I have an open mind, Ahmed.
It's just that a dancer
should have legs.
Duck! Duck!
[ Whispering ]
Do something!
Okay, Ahmed, I'll tell ya what.
Bottom line here.
You don't start treating
me right, I'm taking
my business to Gemal.
Yeah, I'm aware ofthe blood
feud, Ahmed. I don't care.
Salaam alaikum. Milton.
Milton, the Ringos have been
in their room for an hour.
We want it done right.
Two trips if you have to.
These people do not have time
foryou to build the pyramids.
Milton Glickman has never
made two trips in his life
and never will.
The Duchess of Windsor,
1948, 41 pieces, one trip.
John Barrymore, 1941...
38 pieces including
Mr. Barrymore...
drunk as a lord,
one trip.
Drunk as a lord,
one trip.
The Who, 1975--
Just get the bags to the room
before they check out.
167 pieces.
One trip.
I spoke to the union.
You were wrong. I am allowed...
to fire that
senile old idiot.
Really?. Did you speak
to Miss Tantorelli at the
Brooklyn office because--
I want him out.
Look, Mr. Himmelman,
you can't fire Milton.
He's been here forever.
A hotel is more than just
facilities and amenities.
- Are you trying to tell me
how to run a hotel?.
- No, sir. Would never do that.
I'm just saying that the
Bradbury's like a family.
It's a place where you have
an eccentric old bellhop or
a hotel manager that charges...
thousands of dollars
in personal long-distance
phone calls to the hotel.
Doesn't mean we want
that family member fired...
or in jail.
Because that would be upsetting
to the family. You understand?.
Yes, you might be right, Duck.
Happens.
Hey, Vincent, what's
happening in your sordid
little world today?.
Divorce court.
[Woman ]...to the most
fabulous city in the world...
and your idea of a second
honeymoon is sitting in a dark
room eating a tuna sandwich.
[Man ]
I'm just about
ready to go, honey.
Where?. Back to the room to
watch Wheel of Fortune? I came
here to fall in love again.
All you wanna do
is fall asleep.
It was a very good sandwich.
Thank you.
He's doomed, Dougie.
The rube's marriage is doomed.
Yep.
Them hicks
have difficulties:
when to plant things, which
shirt to put on the scarecrow.,
pressure builds up.
Well, there's nothin'
we can do about it.
Dougie, I'm just a bartender.
You're the concierge.
Hey, he seemed
like a nice guy.
Yeah, well, that nice guy
left you a half a buck tip.
You save his marriage.
Dougie! You kept me and the
missus out of divorce court!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[Man ]
Sixteen dollars
for tuna fish?
[ Woman ]
Harry, will you stop talking
about tuna fish?
- Not when it costs
more than my shoes.
- There you are, sir.
I have those tickets
for you.
Tickets?.
The tickets you called about.
Now I could only get fourth-row
orchestra. I'm sorry.
Miss Saigon is very tough to get
at the last second. I made
reservations for dinner...
at the Rainbow Room;
Gigi the maitre d'
is expecting you.
And as per instructions,
the hotel limo will pick you up
at the theater.
Why, Sparky,
you really had me going.
Oh, my God. I can't go
to the Rainbow Room with
my hair like this.
Ask for Kenneth.
He does Ivana.
Thank you.
Well, you came through
like a pro.
How'd ya know?.
I'm the concierge.
I know everything.
You do your job very well.
She hasn't called me Sparky
in a real long time.
Look, I don't know
exactly how to do
this, but, uh--
Uh, look, don't confuse
yourself with all these
little denominations.
You wait until I'm
the best friend you ever had.
Then you give me a tip so big...
it feels like
passing a kidney stone.
Ow. That bad, huh?.
If I'm worth it.
[Phone Ringing]
Excuse me... Sparky.
- [ Ringing ]
- Concierge.
Dougie,
it's Jeanette Vigusian.
Yes, Mrs. Vigusian?.
- From the newsstand?.
- Yes, I know, Mrs. Vigusian.
Have you got a minute?
No, I don't.
You don't have a minute?
Yes, Mrs. Vigusian.
I have a minute.
I thought so.
Everybody has a minute.
- Uh, Mrs. Vigusian--
- What about settling down,
Dougie?
Marriage, children--
Okay, I will.
Thanks, Mrs. Vigusian.
- Over there by the fern.
- Settle down over there
by the fern.
With her...
over there by the fern.
Oh, good idea, Mrs. Vigusian.
I 'll marry her.
Good.
Thanks.
Some sweet?. No?.
Check this out.
That's the new
Julian Russell girl.
Hottest designer,
hottest model. Not many
guys have their fantasies...
come true, Doug,
but today l get mine.
Look, you know how risky
this is, right?.
I could get fired.
I really owe you.
And I'm really
gonna collect.
You speak to your boss yet?.
Sure, sure. He says
he wants to meet with you.
You showed him
the proposal?.
The guy gets 50 a week.
He's not gonna write a blank
check because some bellhop
thinks he has an idea.
I'm a concierge.
Four years ago, Hanover
found Julian Russell and he--
Schlepping suits
in the garment district
for 75 bucks.
Now Julian Russell is the fourth
small business Hanover's
turned to gold since 1985.
You did your homework.
Yeah, well, I--
Now you be a good boy.
I need that room back
by 2:00.
No problem.
[ Clears Throat ]
Hey, Doug, look,
I forgot something.
I was supposed to pick up
some package at Barney's
for Mr. Hanover.
It's a present
for his wife.
Jesus Christ.
- Come on, Doug. This could
be your last day as a bellhop.
- Concierge.
[ Sniffing ]
I can't tell a thing.
It's all confused
with the other scents.
Perhaps on your wrist.
Perhaps not.
Lend me an ear.
What?
[ Sniffing ]
Too woodsy.
Would you like
a second opinion?
Could you?.
Sure.
Miss?.
[ Sniffing Deeply]
[ Laughing ]
[ Snorting ]
You're absolutely right.
You might as well glue
a pine cone back there.
Oh, woodsy, I'm not.
No, no. Top of my head,
I would say...
that you were, uh--
Ah, miss, a bottle of
joy de Jean Patou, please.
My girlfriend wears this.
Now she's about your age.
Well, actually, she's not
your age. She'll be 38 in
June. You're probably 34.
Anyway,Joy is
what she wears,
and I gotta tell you.
That heady musk,
[ Inhales Deeply]
spicy experience...
tempered by
a sweet innocence...
has this boy
rooting and foraging
morning, noon and night.
[ Inhales, Sighs ]
You be careful.
She'll help you with that.
You are some piece of work.
Hey, I got her
out of your face, didn't I?
"Rooting and foraging"?
Tell people what they want to
hear, you can sell 'em anything.
What a lovely thought.
Now here's a lovely thought:
you, me, Friday night...
Miss Saigon, fourth row,
on the aisle.
Doug, don't start.
I'm not goin' through
this again.
Monster trucks at the Garden.
- I've got a boyfriend.
- You know, you've used
that excuse a number of times.
Well, it's handy,
and it's true.
I hope this guy treats you okay.
Why?.
Does he?.
On and off.
Lately?.
- We spent last weekend
in Saint Bart's.
- Don't look tan. Rained out?
"No, Doug, we just never
made it out of the room. "
All right,
I'm gonna come back when
I'm older, richer and married.
That way,you won't
be able to resist me.
Never said he was married.
Listen, I've gotta go.
He's married.
Gary, you were suppose to be out
of there an hour ago. I got
newlyweds comin' in at 5:00.
Doug, I did it.
Oh, spare me the details.
No, I made the call.
The big man will be
here tomorrow.
Yes!
And I trust everything
was satisfactory, miss?
Thanks.
[ Clearing Throat ]
[ Snorting ]
Hey, Freddy, why don't you
take the old girl home...
and give her a rest, huh?.
Old girl?.
This is--
Gypsy Jill.
Ran at Belmont.
Won at Belmont.
What were you
smokin' that year?.
Let me see. Sixty-six, uh--
Great.
[ Sighs ]
Good-bye.
Thanks for coming.
I've fallen
and I can't get up.
1204, fresh peaches
peeled and a Manchester
Guardian every morning.
820, Mr. Mohammed
needs a translator
to go to Jackie Mason.
Concierge. Christ!
[ Bird ] Jesus Christ,
son of the Lord.
No, just Doug. Uh-huh.
I'll tell you what.
Let me put you through...
to our restaurant expert.
Okay, need six at 8:30.
Sell him on Monastero.
Call Monastero.
Ask for Mort.
Milton, you're supposed
to be in 302 getting
their luggage.
These people
have a plane.
And I have an ashtray.
Mr. Bradbury was very
specific about the sand.
Mr. Bradbury has been dead...
since 1968, these people
have a 2:30 flight.
There ya go, Mr. B.
Have a nice day.
You know, they cremated him,
and when I did this
to his ashes...
people wept.
I'm sure that's not
all they did. Milton, 302.
[Piano ]
Or on a crowded avenue
You are here
So am I
Maybe millions
of people go by
But they all disappear
From view
And I only have eyes
For you
Hmph! Hmph!
That was great.
Really?.
What did you think?.
Uh, well, I thought
that that...
really... sucked.
[ Laughing ]
[ Gary] That's not true. You
have a nice touch, sir. Really.
Shut up, Gary.
Christian Hanover.
Douglas Ireland, sir.
I really appreciate
you meeting me.
Christian, please.
You know, it's great to be
back at the Bradbury.
I proposed to my wife
in this very bar.
I think she only said yes
to get me stop playing
that song.
[ Laughing ]
That's very funny.
Gary, don't you have to go...
and see Julian
at the agency?.
That's, uh, next week.
Well, leave now.
Yes, sir. Uh, Doug,
take good care of my boss.
So, uh, Christian,
can I get you a coffee,
somethin' to drink?.
My room.
Gary did mention it.
Uh, yes, absolutely.
Please follow me.
I'll tell you
what you're thinking.
"Why does a guy who makes
that much money need me
to comp him a room??"
No, sir. I mean, uh,
that's none of my business.
I'm making it your business.
Two reasons.
I value discretion, Doug.
I didn't get where I am
by letting everyone
know my every move.
Two: I wanted you
to be in the position
of doing me a favor...
'cause I've done one for you
by coming here today.
It's a small thing,
but it's important between men.
We stand equal going in.
Shoot, Doug. Bang-bang.
What price can you
put on a dream?.
I hope it gets
better than this.
Well?
Uh, what price can you put
on a dream?. A hotel...
is more than a place where you
eat and you sleep; it's a place
where dreams come true.
I'll just skip ahead
to the next section.
Okay, here it is
without the poetry.
A hotel like none that
has ever existed, and it's
already built, in here.
Two years ago, I got a tip
on an incredible property
on Roosevelt Island.
Middle of the East River, best
views of Manhattan. I got a
two-year option for 40 grand.
Now that's every tip I've made
in the last five years. I got
one month to get this rollin'...
- or it's goin' back
to the city, and I'm screwed.
- How much to get it from here?.
Three million dollars to
start. Now before you say
no, sir, I sketched out...
some start-up figures
and it's foolproof;
just read this.
Nothing is foolproof.
Zoning approval?
Contingent upon a small public
park in the southeast corner.
- Budget will reflect current
building code requirements.
- Handicap ramps, bathrooms.
The city signed off
on G-111 minimums?
Pending.
What's a G-111 minimum,
Doug?.
Well, that's the minimum
G-1, uh...
It's made up, Doug.
- That's the G-111
"no bullshit clause," sir.
- Exactly.
[Knock At Door]
That's probably
the day maid.
Actually, I'm expecting someone.
She's not my wife, partner.
Enough said?.
More than enough.
We'll be an hour or so.
- I'll take the prospectus
when I go.
- Thank you, sir.
And may I once again--
Open the door.
Doug. Hi.
Honey, meet Doug.
Hi, honey.
You look sensational.
Send up a liter
of mineral water.
You got it, partner.
Doug, uh, could
I get some advice?.
Don't want what you can't have.
I mean, I just want
to buy some clothes.
Yeah, sorry, Mr. Wegman.
Um, absolutely.
What do you have in mind?.
I don't know. I thought
maybe a sports jacket...
some colorful shirts;
Mrs. Wegman thinks I--
Women. Who knows
what they want?.
Oh, I know what they want.
Money.
That's what they want.
Here, try this.
Xena on fifth. Ask for Rick.
Tell him I sent ya.
Great. Thanks.
Doug?. You okay?.
Top of the world.
[ Elevator Dings ]
Thank you, Doug.
Uh, not a problem,
Mr. Hanover.
Christian. Please.
You'll see that she--
The hotel limo will take her
wherever she needs to go.
Very good.
Uh, you will, uh--
I'll, uh, I'll look
it over today.
Thank you.
Thank you.
She's a lovely girl,
isn't she?
What girl?
Very good, Doug.
So long, my friend.
[Doug Knocking]
Miss Hart, I have
a car waiting for you.
I need the room.
My supervisor wants
to know why I'm behind.
You want me to tell her?.
Marie, Marie, Marie,
what do you need?.
Basketball you hate.
- Man of La Mancha you saw,
and the woman fainted.
- Mets/Dodgers box seats.
Oh, get a life.
I'll just tell
my supervisor.
Mets/Dodgers box seats.
What do you know?.
Had 'em all the time.
Amazing.
You'll enjoy that. It's
blackmailer appreciation night.
[Door Opening]
Oh,Jesus. It's okay.
He left ten minutes ago.
I'm looking for my lipstick.
Yeah, well, buy a new one.
Ball's over, Cinderella.
I need the room.
This isn't
what it looks like.
It never is.
- What's that suppose to mean?.
-Just forget about it, okay?.
Get your stuff together.
No, I won't forget about it.
What did you mean?.
It's not what it looks
like?  Let me guess why.
He loves you. You love him.
His wife doesn't understand
him. The marriage is over
except for some paperwork.
The gifts, trips,
the chardonnay during lunch;
they're not what compel you.
It's the little boy inside
of him that no one else
sees. How am I doin'?.
Boy, are you mean.
But am I wrong?.
Yes. We don't drink
wine with lunch.
Well, there ya go.
[Alarm Ringing]
Who the hell are you
to judge me?
Excuse me?.
I know what
you're thinking.
[Shuts Off Alarm ]
I'm not thinking anything.
Christian's marriage
has been dead a long time.
Sir, enjoyed your stay?.
Fine, fine.
He's been going
through a difficult divorce.
I'm staying out of the way.
You try the breakfast buffet?.
We're quite proud of that.
Oh, excellent.
I didn't even know
he was married when we met.
Country sausage is a real treat.
You know the definition
of "concierge"?
It's French for "asshole."
Eddie, what are you doing?
I thought I heard
a bugle call.
Well, I, um--
[Lily]
Now you just sit there
and practice your dirges.
[Knock At Door]
Someday you may want to enter
your father's business...
and start a parlor
of your own.
Hey, Leon. How ya doin'?
Come on in.
Douglas.
The Munsters, huh?
Uh, which one is this?
The one where Lily gets pissed
at Herman 'cause he's foolin'
around with the ski instructors.
A classic. Anyway,
thanks very much, and
I'll see you later.
You wanna stay and have a beer,
'cause Grandpa's gonna turn
Eddie into a housefly.
Well, my girl's waiting
out on the moped.
Oh, you should go.
Thanks, Leon.
[Grandpa ]...Paderewski's
hangnail, an E minor chord
from the organ...
at Westminster Abbey,
a doorknob off the
Grand Canyon suite...
and three-- three mind you--
sequins from Liberace's jacket.
[ Eddie ]
What's this?
[ Sniffing ]
[ Bugle ]
[ Grandpa ]
Oh, I just gotta stop
reading the racing form...
while I 'm mixing
these magic pills.
[ Laughing]
Damn.
Let's deal before these
shows close, huh?. Two
Tommy Tunes looking...
for six Mets;
that'll be 28.
Four Mets lookin' for
two Cats. Four times 12.
Plus a Saigon. Eighteen bucks.
- Thanks very much.
- Hold on to your watches.
He's a real operator.
Some guys see the picture.
Okay, Saigon wants Les Mis,
lookin' for Yankee day games...
Lookin' for Ice Capades.
You still building your hotel?.
Boardwalk or Park Place?.
Boardwalk. I need Pavarotti.
Anybody got Pavarotti?
Yeah, I got Pavarotti.
So all you need is $3 million.
Just a couple
hundred...
years' tips.
Got it. Got a guy
who's got it.
- What about my night games?.
- Gettin' to night games. Dougie
needs six Grand Hotels.
Charlotte needs two Cats and
a Phantom. Six times 50 is
three, minus two times 60.
Minus 40, plus
Secret Gardens and
Charlotte's a happy camper.
Okay, Ruben needs night games.
Ruben's got night games. How
did this Donahue get in here?.
All right, everybody happy?.
Okay, pleasure doin' business
with you. Thanks very much.
jusqu'a l'annee
prochaine. Bonne chance.
Thank you.
Merci.
Ed Drinkwater,
Internal Revenue Service.
Oh, members of the service
are not allowed to accept...
gifts, donations,
premiums or favors.
Article 35, section B.
I can, however, make a note
of your unsuccessful
attempt at bribery.
Why don't you make a note
that it was a joke?
It was a joke.
Now, I've dropped by,
Mr. Ireland, because we're
reviewing selected cases...
of gratuity-intensive
occupations.
It seems that
some people don't report
their full incomes.
Really?  In this country?
I know
about you people.
I know about
the 50-dollar handshakes.
I was gonna report this.
No doubt. You interest me,
Mr. Ireland.
And is it my eyes, Ed?
You can laugh all you like,
Mr. Ireland. Laugh away.
I can assure you,
your government
is not laughing.
We're not a bunch of simpering
apes here for your amusement.
I'm not going away.
Now how does a man with your
salary take a 40,000-dollar
option on real estate?.
That's very easy to explain.
Well, there will be
a time for explanations.
Now, here is a notification
of your field audit.
I'll be back...
on the 15th at 4:00 P.M.
have your documentation
ready.
I count the hours
'til we meet again.
I got Leona. I'll get you.
Yeah, no cheese.
I'm tellin' you, they're cheese

You's got a certain party
registered here...
under the name
of a real dickhead,
name of Gene Salvatore?.
He registered here?.
He here?.
Uh, dickhead, dickhead.
Um, is there someone
I should say is calling?
Yeah, we got a surprise
for him. You could tell him
Joey Pickles says hello.
Tell him that.
No, you can't tell him that.
It'll ruin the surprise.
- Yeah, you can't tell him that.
- What are you, some kind
of blabby rat bastard?.
- "Gene Salvatore. 1950."

Happy birthday.
I'd just like to say

Duck! Duck!
I am enjoying positive
humors this morning.
Why?  That new whip come in?
I spent some very pleasant
time with a man from
the tax bureau.
Drinkwasser?
Well, I don't think
there's any problem.
Correct. There's no problem.
Mr. Drinkwasser assured us...
that the hotel is not
a subject of inquiry;
only you, Duck.
So I told him I would
gladly cooperate.
I'm glad you found a new friend.
Mmm, yes, Duck.
What times we had.
But he seemed particularly
interested in a deduction
you've been claiming...
on a property
on "Roosenfeld" Island.
Roosevelt. President,
statesman, war hero.
Quite. He spoke of liens,
attachments, disciplines.
You know,
my attention wandered.
You know, Mr. Himmelman,
I think this is the first time
I've ever seen you smile.
Yes, Duck. I'm enjoying
positive humor today.

Sure.

and I absolutely cannot.
Go along, clap loudly
and see her home for me.
What
do you want me to tell her?
Just make me
sound forlorn.
Forlorn?.
Everytime I hear
the classics
My pulse quickens
Ooh, I need a man
who knows his

From his Dickens
I could love a man
who uses his head

his shoes under the bed

I could love a man
who uses his head

already forgotten

I could love a man who

Uses his head
Ooh, yeah
Yeah!
That was great.
Is someone
sitting here?
Yes.
You know, I think that's
where you're mistaken.
Why am I mistaken?.
Christian said to tell you
he was unavoidably detained.
Oh.
Yeah, afraid so.
And he sent you
scurrying over to tell me?
Well, I didn't scurry.
I don't scurry.
I take the subway
like any other animal.
Christian and I have formed
this friendship wherein
we do each other favors.
For instance, right now,
he's at the 7-Eleven
getting me a Slurpee.
About the other day...
you kind of took me
by surprise, you know.
I'm sorry.
Where is he?.
I told ya. I really
wanted a Slurpee.
No. Really.
He said he was very sorry that
he couldn't make it, and he
was absolutely... forlorn...
and he had to, uh--
Did he go to the country?.
Yeah. He went directly
from the office.
His wife's in the country.
No. No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.
No, he went to the country.
His wife went to, uh,
a different country.
- She went to France.
- France?.
Yeah. It's finally over
between them, and she
was really depressed...
and she felt she needed
to go somewhere where she
could, uh, speak French.
What?.
Yeah, you know
how rich people are.
You or I get depressed,
we sit alone in our rooms;
they get depressed...
they get on the Concorde
and go to Europe.
He left her?.
Yeah. He just wanted
to pack up everything that
might remind you of her...
so that when you went out
there, you weren't...
reminded of her.
He's alone out there.
Yeah, and forlorn.
I mean,
that's the word for it--
absolutely forlorn.
But there was somethin'
he had to do, and he's bein'
a real brick about it.
Aw, that's so sweet.
Yeah. Sweet guy.
They didn't like me.
They did. They did.
In fact, the guys
at the table next to me?.
They were very specific
about what they liked about
you. You wanna hear?
Uh-uh. Thanks.

Guess this is
a tough business, huh?.

It's possible the guy may
have come into the hotel, but
I do not know Christian Hanover.
It's for you.
It's the guy you don't know.

good afternoon.
Not at this end, sport.
Andy called here.
As we speak, she's
on a bus on her way out here
with the impression...
that I am all alone here

she apparently got from you.
The problem is, Doug,
I am not alone.
Quite the contrary.
My wife and I have our
annual Memorial Day picnic,
thank you very much.
What in the hell am
I suppose to do?.
Christian, I'll handle it.
What's your address?.
913 Dune Road,
Southampton.
Which means i twill
take you several days
to get out here.
All right, Christian,
I'm gonna have
to put you on hold.
Look, go. Go!
Okay, 913 Dune Road.
Don't worry, sir.
I'll be there.

Hello.
Excuse-moi.
Sorry to bother you, darling...
but a strange man just
jumped out of a helicopter
and attacked Priscilla Bailey.
It's all right, dear.
He's a friend of mine.
Uh, thanks.
Any sign of Andy yet?.
Not yet. Listen, sport,
I cannot have dirty laundry
washed in front of these people.
No, no. Very clean laundry.
How are you?
Just fine.
And you?.
That's the man that attacked

"You're coming home with me. "

Uh, hi.
Excuse me. Comin' through.
Excuse me.

But, Doug--
Doug.
Doug. I just wanted
to say good-bye.
We had a wonderful time.
So long, old bean.
What are you doing here?.
I'm saving you from
a very embarrassing mistake.
Saving me?
You're the one that told me
Christian was alone. You
said Eleanor was in France.
It was French class.
She's agreed to the divorce, and
you're gonna ruin everything.
She has?
Yeah, sure.
How can they
have this party?.
To keep up appearances.
It's a pre-divorce party.
They're very big
in the Hamptons.
Anyway, this is a bad one
'cause he's over there,
and she's over there.
- Yeah, I guess so. Hi.
- Let's go.
Is that her?.
Yeah.
She's very pretty.
She is, and he's
leavin' her for you.
Come on, let's go.
Well, this is
really embarrassing.
She shouldn't have
to find out that I'm having
an affair with her husband.
What did you say?.
We gotta go.
Were you talking about me?.
Oh, God.
I'm so sorry.
What a horrible way
to find out.
Please forgive me.
I can't--
This is--
Excuse me.
Thanks.

we were leaving.
- Ever wonder how many bathrooms
a place like this has?.
- Her!
I don't know that woman.
She seems to know you
pretty well, Randall.
- Five on this floor already.
- I wanna talk to her!
Um, now is not
a good time.
That woman just told...
my wife she's having
an affair with me.
She had the wrong woman.
It was an honest mistake.
She thought your wife
was Mrs. Bailey.
Good God! Josh Bailey?.
That's why we can't
let her out of the room.
I wanna save the Baileys
from the kind of hell
you and Mrs....

but so is my wife.

on a peach Aston-Martin.

It's not your secretary.

want to see him again!

Yeah, that was her.
Did she call me
an asshole?
Gee, I don't know.
- Something about tell
that rascal something.
- I said asshole, asshole!
Asshole. She said asshole.
You were right.

I don't know
if that's a good idea.
- I said put her on, Doug!
- Uh, Andy.
- Christian would like
to speak to you.
- Not in this lifetime.
He says he loves you,
and it's really important.

Not the response we were
looking for, Christian.
Okay, Doug,
what does she need?.
What does she want to hear?.

of intimate apparel.

the favor.

not necessary.

All right, all right.
How about The River House?.
The River House is good.
Where do I check in?
Uh, right over there.
That's the lobby. Over here
is the dining room, elevator banks
and that's the bar.
Eight different kinds of wine
by the glass, pistachio nuts
out of the shell.
You really can see,
can't you?
I 've been that way
most of my life.
I grew up in a hotel.
My old man was a cook
at a resort in the Catskills
for 27 years.
- A place called Hurley's.
-  Every day's a holiday
at Hurley's
Yeah.
Not for my old man.
Brought home $137.14 a week.
Dropped dead in the kitchen
of a heart attack.
He was 59 years old.
Wow.
You see it?.
Yes.
I'm not going to be
a 59-year-old bellhop.
Concierge.
I'm not gonna be
anything if l make you
late for Christian.
Maybe we should make
him wait for once.
Not tonight. There's
too much at stake.
[Car Alarm Chirps ]
I love that.
[Doug]
Damn, you look great.
Thank you.
[ Sighs ]
[ Starts Engine ]
[ Revs Engine In Neutral,
Shifts Into Drive ]
So, Italy.
Christian's taking
a house in Tuscany
for a couple of weeks.
We're leaving after
the show on Thursday.
Nice.
You been to Italy?
Eaten the food.
Worn the shoes.
Never actually been.
Christian has a lot
of friends there.
Ah.
Two minutes to spare.
How about that?.
I got it.
I had a wonderful
time today...
even if it was
'cause you had to.
I had a great time too.
[ Laughs ]
Anyway--
Yeah, um...
good night.
Hey.
Now what?
I don't know.
No fresh excuse
from Christian?
No, not that I know of.
So what are you
doing here?.
Jack Daniels,
rocks, please.
It's a free country. I took
the car back to the hotel,
and it occurred to me...
that Christian
might be late.
Above
and beyond the call of duty.
He should be along
any minute anyway.
Of course, he will.
Do you want
to just sit down and get
an appetizer or something?.
Sue Spatz on the green
of the par four 17th
at Hurley's.
How old?
She?
Sixteen.
Same.
Contributing factors?.
A bottle of Mateus Rose
and that she was going...
to boarding school the next day,
which I had turned into the
equivalent of going to war.
-Current status of relationship.
-Christmas card two years ago.
You?
Phil Gibson on the couch
of his parents' den.
Age?
Phil?
Seventeen.
Eighteen.
- God, even then!
- One year! Shut up!
Contributing factors?
We were watching
Wuthering Heights.
Current status?.
Unknown.
He's out wandering the moors,
crying, "Andy! Andy!!"
[ Laughing ]
How come you don't
have a girlfriend?.
Between working and trying
to get my hotel set up,
I just don't have the time.
You weren't too busy today.
Well, today was--
Business.
I forgot.
I wasn't gonna say that.
[Man Clearing
Throat ]
[Doug]
Mr. Wegman?
- Whoa!
- Not bad, huh?.
You look good!
Andy Hart, Mr. Wegman.
Hi, Harry Wegman.
How are you?.
Doesn't he look good?.
You look good.
[Doug]
You look good.
How did Mrs. Wegman react?
- She, she laughed.
- That's not good. How long
have you been married?
This is our 20th anniversary.
Well, did it ever
occur to you...
that she actually likes you
just the way you are?
- Hey, didn't you say
you wanted to dance?
- Uh, yeah.
Why don'tyou two
get out there and give
Mrs. Wegman a wake-up call?
- Come on, Harry.
- Okay. Thanks.
I 'm sorry.
You're doing fine.
Yeah.
Which one's your wife?
She is that very
beautiful woman
right there.
[Andy]
The incredibly jealous one?
Yeah.
You got a great guy there.
He's made a very big
effort for me.
That's what Doug does.
It's his job.
He makes a living out of being
nice to people who might give
him something in return.
That's funny.
I never got that impression.
I guess you know him
a lot better than I do.
Not really.
Well, I may be naive--
I am naive, definitely.
But he's, he's gone way
out of his way to help me
with my little situation.
You don't do that for money.
That comes from the heart.
[ Whispering ]
[ Song Ends ]
"In Your Eyes," fellas.
This next song was dedicated
to a very special couple...
here tonight
for a very special occasion,
Mr. And Mrs. Harry Wegman.
- Happy anniversary!
- [ Applause ]
Look at you
More sparkling than a glass
of fine champagne
Look at me
I'm higher than a kiss
on lover's lane
At the evening's start
my lonely heart
Think Christian
would mind if we dance?.
You want to dance with me
or Christian?.
Well, Christian's
not here, so--
In your eyes
Look at you
You shine like starlight
Is he a big tipper?
Harry?  I doubt it.
Look at 'em.
Look at me
I feel I'm floating on
Poetry in motion.
Get her, Harry.
A moonlight beam
At the evening's start
my lonely heart
Was taken by surprise
When I saw myself
In your eyes
Look at us
We danced
And yet our feet
don't touch the ground
Miss Hart?
There's a phone call for you.
You can take it at the bar.
Thank you.
Guess who?.
...upside down
Hello?.
Sweetheart, it's me.
I'm so sorry.
Julian locked himself
in the storage room
with the entire collection.
It took me hours to coax him
out again. Anyway, I'm out
of here in half an hour.
I'll meet you at our suite
at the Bradbury. Hmm?.
Oh, right.
I'll call Doug
and get him to set it up.
Uh, he's here.
Yeah?.
Well, he saw you were going
to be late, so he stayed
to keep me company.
He's a terrific baby-sitter.
Put him on.
Okay. Christian.
Hey, Christian.
How's the man?.
The man is busy.
Listen, take Andy back
to the Bradbury and put her
in our usual suite.
I'll meet her there. Got it?.
Yeah, I got it.
I'll take care of it.
And, Doug, I'm going
to have some very good news
about our little venture.
Great.
I'll get the check.
I'm sorry about what
happened back there.
Nothing
happened.
Well, no, I mean,
nothing happened...
but, you know.
I don't know.
What happened was that
you got your deal.
Congratulations.
Thanks. You too.
I mean, you and Christian,
it looks like that's
gonna work out.
Uh-huh.
Look, all I was saying was
I'm glad that he called
when he called...
and nothing crazy happened,
and we didn't--
Nothing crazy
was going to happen.
I don't know what you think,
but nothing was close
to happening.
Okay.
Well.
Well.
So I can open
this champagne now...
or would you like
to wait for Christian?
I'll wait, thanks.
Music?.
No, I'll wait
for Christian.
- Would you like me
to turn down the bed?.
- Why not?.
Will that be all then, miss?.
That's it?  That's all
you have to say?.
What would you like me to say?
Oh, I forgot. You don't
say a thing unless
Christian tells you to!
You're like his houseboy,
for Christ's sake!
Well, if I'm his houseboy,
what's your job description?.
Damn you.
What's up, Doug?.
Hey, how you doing?
Everything all right?.
You look a little upset.
Uh, yeah, I'm fine.
It was just a long day.
Where's Andy?.
Resting.
Oh, my lawyers assure me
they can work out our
problems with the I.R.S.
Come to Julian's show
Thursday, and I'll have
the commitment papers.
We're in business,
partner.
Uh, thank you, sir.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I think I have some
fences to mend.
Hello, darling.
Christian, you can't
keep doing this to me.
Andy,
I've left Eleanor.
Really?
I promised you I would,
and I have.
I'm so happy.
[ "I Only Have
Eyes For You"]
[ Elevator Dings ]
[ Fire Alarm Ringing ]
[Applause ]
Gonna ride the bullet
Gonna ride the bullet
Gonna ride the bullet
Oh, yeah
Gonna ride the bullet
Gonna ride the bullet
Gonna ride the bullet
Oh, yeah
[ Indistinct
Backstage Chatter]
[ Christian Laughing ]
Come on!
What are you waiting for?
Come on, come on,
let's go!
Come on, come on, come on!
Beautiful! Beautiful!
Oh! I'm sorry.
Whoa.
[Indistinct Shouting]
[ Christian ]
Doug!
I'm sorry about the chaos, but
I wanted to do this in person.
I'm fond of ceremony.
My kind of ceremony.
- Rather like a candy store.
- All right, one second,
one second, one second.
Beautiful.
Good-bye.
Commitment papers.
Sign them and deliver
them to my lawyer.
There's an extra form there
transferring the lease option
over to my corporation.
I'm not the one
the I.R.S. is looking at.
If you prefer to spend
the next 12 months in audit
than construction--
No, no, this is good.
Thanks.
Good.
Congratulations.
Amazing.
It's nice when everyone
gets what they want.
It hardly ever happens.
Well, almost
everybody, I guess.
What do you mean?.
Huh?.
Well, your wife.
Eleanor.
You left your wife, right?
God, no.
No, Doug, she's my third wife.
You never leave your third wife.
What about Andy?
Eleanor and I
have an arrangement.
She forgives me my Andys,
and I agree never
to divorce her.
Your "Andys"?
Is that a problem, Doug?
No, I think that's a swell
arrangement, Christian.
Exactly.
[Julian ]
Christian, let's go!
We can get it up
We have got
the power
We can get it up
The Doug?.
Yeah, done deal.
That's great.
So, when are you leaving?
Right from here. I can't wait.
Yeah, Italy
will be nice.
It'll be good for us.
No more sneaking around.
Really?.
He promised.
Andy, uh--
[Cheering, Applause ]
Thank you, Mr. Drinkwater.
I'll be in touch.
Who was that?.
He looks familiar.
That's just a man who
helps me out occasionally.
No one you know.
Hey, taxi! Yo!
Duck! Duck!
Oh, Duck!
"Duck" you.
Please, please, please, please,
please, please, please, please.
I'm coming.
I'm coming.
What?
Oh, please, please, please.
Oh, Doug. Look, kid,
this is not a good time.
Come back in two minutes.
I haven't got two minutes,
Mr. Salvatore. Now, I've
always been very good toyou.
Yeah, so?
The dogs, the jewelry.
I got you those little "t'ings!"
[Woman ]
Gene, I'm getting cold.
Look, Doug--
You own United Carting,
right?
So, what is it?
Your cousin, he wants
to collect garbage?  Fine.
No, no, no.
I need a very big favor.
Taxi!
Hope you brought
a good book.
[Indistinct Shouting,
Horns Honking]
Come on, Freddy,
help me out here.
I got Miss Saigon...
I got Cats, Les Mis,
the Grateful Dead...
at Nassau Coliseum.
The Dead?
Why didn't you say so?
Giddyap!
Giddyap?
Giddyap.
Yee-ha.
[Horse Whinnies,
Doug Screaming]
Oh, God!
Yippee-ki-yi-yay!
[ Horns Honking ]
[Man ]
Get that truck out of here!
What's with
this traffic?
The I.R.S.
Where?
The guy you were talking to.  I
remembered where I saw him. He's
an I.R.S. agent trailing Doug.
Oh, yeah,
Drinkwater.
He works for you?
No, he works
for the I.R.S.
But sometimes when I need
someone nudged a little--
What do you mean?
I needed the option
on that property signed
over to my name.
Drinkwater made it appear
expedient to Doug.
You tricked him?
And here they come
down the homestretch.
It's GypsyJill on the inside.
A brilliant stretch run
by the great filly.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, listen, you want to trade?
Trade?.
Take the horse.
You'll love the horse.
Horse?.
An opportunity came up,
and I acted upon it.
It's not in anyone's
best interest to let
that property...
go to waste in the hands
of a bellhop.
We're going to miss
the flight!
It's his idea, it's his dream.
Yo, mister,
what gives?.
I can't--
You got 30 seconds
to get this truck
out of here...
or you got a date
with me in the two-two
precinct tonight.
Let's go!
Move it out!
Yo, let's go! Go!
Move it out.
Go, go, go!
Look, you don't tell me
how to run my business and
I won't tell you how to--
How to what, Christian?.
Tell me how to what?.
To sing?
You've never even
heard me sing.
I'm a very busy man.
Now, please spare me
the tantrums.
Just grow up,
will you?
Yes, I will,
starting right now.
Andy. Andy.
Andy! Andy, come back.
All right, I'm sorry. Please.
[ Horns Honking ]
Andy! Andy!
- Andy!
- Doug!
- He's not leaving his wife!
- Don't sign. It's a trick!
I just thought
you should know.
He's a crook.
He wants to steal
your property.
He doesn't deserve you!
I thought
I should warn you.
[Mr. Wegman ]
Hey, Doug. Hey, we got
a little mix-up here.
I never got the watch box.
Yeah, you remember
the jewelry guy...
said I should mail myself
the box and then I would--
Anyway, I never got the box.
But I got the plans.
Boy, they are just spectacular.
[ Doug ]
Who is this?
Harold Wegman.
Harry Wegman.
Don't you remember?
Harry!
Wow, this is a surprise.
Yeah, look, who do I
make the check out to?
I don't usually deal in loans
this small, but, boy, a hotel
like this on Roosevelt Island?
- It's too good to pass up.
- How did you get those plans?
Welcome to the Bradbury.
Never mind, Harry.
I figured it out.
- [Applause ]
- Ooh!
