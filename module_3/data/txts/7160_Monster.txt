Mum!
Mum!
How does this story begin?
<font color="#00ffff"><i>It begins like so many stories.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>With a boy.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Too old to be a kid.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Too young to be a man.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>And a nightmare.</i></font>
It's got two fundamental constants.
E, the base of the natural
logarithm system,
it's a number,
it's a number that emerges from asking:
What is the mathematical
function or thing,
which describes things,
where the rate at which they change,
is proportional to their magnitude?
Now, if you do that mathematically,
it will give you
this fundamental constant.
Conor?
Are you all right, Conor?
You look tired.
Are you getting enough rest?
Yeah, I'm fine.
'Cause if you ever wanted to talk...
I'm fine.
Ok.
Everyone, eyes front.
Pi is the ratio of the circumference,
and when you put it...
Careful there, O'Malley.
You might fall.
Are you drunk or something?
He'll have to get his slaphead mother
to kiss it for him.
You're always off
in your own little dream world.
What's there so interesting?
Get off!
You've been a good boy.
Remember, O'Malley,
good boys don't talk.
Hey, Con!
Hey, Mum.
What is that?
It's a surprise.
So, this is a VCR?
This is much better than a VCR.
It's your grandpa's
old film projector.
There we go.
I wish you could have known him.
Who?
Grandpa.
Even Grandma softened up around him.
Yeah, all right.
Here we go.
What a bunch of assholes.
Why are they trying to kill King Kong?
People don't like
what they don't understand.
They get scared.
King Kong could just smash them all.
Break them into a million pieces.
Yeah.
Conor.
Mum?
I have come to get you,
Conor O'Malley.
Why don't you run, Conor O'Malley?
Why don't you run for your mother?
You leave her alone!
I'm not afraid of you!
I will visit you again
on further nights, Conor O'Malley.
And I will shake your walls
until you wake.
And then,
I will tell you three stories.
You're going to tell me stories?
I am.
I will tell you three stories,
and when I have finished my stories,
you will tell me a fourth.
I don't know anything about stories!
You will tell me a fourth,
and it will be the truth.
What are you talking about?
This truth that you hide.
The truth you dream.
You will tell me your nightmare.
No.
Yes. That will be your truth.
And if I don't?
Con, I was asleep.
You should be in your own bed, Con.
Just five minutes.
That's not true.
Yes, it is.
Come on, Con.
Just five minutes. I promise.
Five minutes.
Night, night.
I respect that, Lizzie, I do.
But the last thing your father
would want would be for him
to be taken off to America
to live with some strange
woman and her strange child.
We have to discuss this now.
Hey, Con!
There's the little man.
Where did you say you got these?
From a very nice old people's home.
They're clearing it out to make flats,
and I'll be the agent.
Your mother needs a cup of tea.
Green, no sugar.
I take mine black.
What do you think, Con?
He loves it.
Go on.
Ok.
Go on, try something else.
Alright.
You can't just drift, Lizzy.
You have to make some decisions.
I am making all the decisions I can,
and I will decide
when I speak to Conor.
Go and help Conor with the tea
or I'll literally go insane.
You and I need to have a talk.
I'm making tea.
Conor!
I said, I'm making...
We have to...
I'm not the enemy Conor.
I'm here to help your mother.
I know why you're here.
I'm here because 12-year-old boys
shouldn't be wiping down counters
without being asked to first.
You wanna do it?
Less of your cheek.
She's always sick
after the treatments.
She'll be better tomorrow.
And then you can go home.
She'll seem better tomorrow.
She needs to talk about this with you.
Talk to me about what?
About you coming to live with me.
I'm never coming to live...
Listen to me Conor. If your mother...
There's no if!
She'll be better and then you can go.
Lizzy?
Lizzy!
Oh my God!
Hold on, hold on.
Where's the medicine?
Conor!
Conor!
I'm here, darling.
Deep breath.
Conor, please!
Please give me the medicine.
Hurry, hurry.
It's coming.
It's coming.
Here we go. Here we go.
Deep breath.
Deep breath.
Deep breath.
Deep breath.
It's Ok.
Just don't touch anything.
Trust me, I'll be doing my very best not to.
Our conversation isn't over,
young man.
Oh, yes, it is.
Mum!
What took you so long?
It is time for me
to tell you the first tale.
I don't need a tale.
I need a bus ticket for my grandma.
It is time for me to tell you the...
Where do you think you're going?
I will be listened to!
I am as old as this land and...
What do you know about anything?
I know everything about you,
Conor O'Malley.
No, you don't!
If you did, you'd know
I don't have time to listen
to stupid stories from a stupid tree
that is just a dream.
A dream?
What is a dream, Conor O'Malley?
And who is to say that it is not
everything else that is a dream?
Never mind.
I came to see you because I thought...
You thought I might have come
to topple your enemies.
Slay your dragons.
Or at least help me
with my grandmother.
But all you want to do
is tell me stories.
Stories of how I toppled my enemies.
Stories of how I slew dragons.
Let me tell you a tale
of when I came walking.
Let me tell you of the end
of a wicked queen
and how I made sure
she was never seen again.
Go on, then.
Good.
What do you see?
Nothing.
There are leaves in the way.
Use your imagination,
Conor O'Malley.
What do you see?
I see a spark.
Yes.
And?
No, it's water.
It's watercolor.
Keep looking.
Indeed.
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Long ago, before this was a town,</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>with roads and trains and cars,</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>this was a kingdom.</i></font>
Here? We don't even have a Tesco.
<font color="#00ffff"><i>It was a prosperous kingdom</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>with a wise king
who had won peace for his people,</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>but peace had come at a price.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>The king had lost all three
of his sons in battle to giants.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>To dragons.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>To armies of men
led by great wizards.</i></font>
This is all sounding pretty fairytale-ish.
You wouldn't say that if you heard
the screams of a man killed by a spear.
<font color="#00ffff"><i>The queen was unable to bear
the loss of all their three sons,</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>leaving the king alone</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i> in despair with the company
of his only remaining heir,</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>his orphaned grandson.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>The child was raised as a prince,</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>winning the love of the kingdom
with his gallantry and good heart.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>His people loved him.</i></font>
Our future king!
<font color="#00ffff"><i>He was nearly a man
when his grandfather took a new wife.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>The king felt ill</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>and rumour began to spread
that she was an evil witch,</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>that she was bent on taking
the throne for herself</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>by poisoning the king.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>A few weeks later, the king died.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>The prince was too young
to take the king's place,</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>so, by law, the queen would rule
for another year.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>The future was uncertain.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>The prince, meanwhile,
had given away his heart.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>She was beautiful and smart,</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>and though only a farmer's daughter,
the kingdom smiled on the match.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>The queen, however,
she was rather enjoying being queen.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>And what better way to remain so
than to marry the prince herself?</i></font>
What? That's disgusting!
She was his grandmother!
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Step-grandmother.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>And still a young, beautiful
woman herself, don't forget.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>The prince, however,
didn't like the idea either.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>He took the farmer's daughter
and they rode away into the night.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>They stopped to rest
under the branches of a yew tree.</i></font>
That's you!
<font color="#00ffff"><i>The next morning, the prince awoke.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>'Arise, my beloved', he said.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>But the farmer's daughter
did not stir,</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>which was when the prince
noticed the blood.</i></font>
Blood?
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Someone had killed his beloved
in the night.</i></font>
What?
<font color="#00ffff"><i>'The queen!', he cried.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>'The queen has murdered my bride!'</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>The villagers, full of fury
and vengeance, rose up at the crime.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>It was then that I came walking.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>The queen was never seen again.</i></font>
Good! She deserved it!
Now, I don't suppose
you can help me with my grandma.
The story is not yet finished.
I took the queen
and carried her far enough away
so the town's people
would never find her.
To a village by the sea,
where she began a new life.
But she killed the farmer's daughter!
How can you save a murderer?
You really are a monster.
I never said
she killed the farmer's daughter.
I only said
that the prince said it was so.
The prince never fell asleep
that night,
<font color="#00ffff"><i>but waited for the farmer's daughter
to be lost in her dreams,</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>and then began his real plan.</i></font>
What?
<i>He knew her death would start a fire
that would consume the queen entire.</i>
That's a terrible story!
And a cheat!
It's a true story.
Many things that are true
feel like a cheat.
Kingdoms get the princes they deserve.
Farmers' daughters die for no reason.
And sometimes witches merit saving.
Quite often, actually.
You'd be surprised.
So, the good prince was a murderer
and the evil queen
wasn't a witch after all?
No, the queen most certainly
was a witch
and could well have been
on her way to great evil.
Who can say?
Then Why'd you save her then?
Because what she was not,
was a murderer.
<font color="#00ffff"><i>She hadn't poisoned the king.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>He had merely grown old.</i></font>
Did the prince ever get caught?
No.
<font color="#00ffff"><i>He became a much beloved king</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>who ruled happily
until the end of his long days.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Oh, yes!</i></font>
I don't get it.
Who's the good guy here?
There is not always a good guy,
Conor O'Malley.
Nor is there always a bad one.
Most people are somewhere in between.
So how is all this
meant to save me from Grandma?
It is not her you need saving from.
There are always two sides to a story.
How many of you know the saying:
'Sticks and stones
may break your bones,
but words can never hurt you'?
Next time, when someone
says something to you...
Good, you're home.
Your mum's upstairs.
She wants to talk to you.
What?
Your father's flying in on Sunday.
Dad's coming?
From America?
Go on. She is waiting.
And pack a bag.
You're coming to stay with me
for a few days.
Go on!
That tree is amazing.
It's been here for thousands of years.
What do you think?
I think Grandma is trying
to turn me into Tina Turner.
She must be a fan.
Why am I going to stay with Grandma?
Are you going back to hospital?
Come here, Con.
This latest treatment's not doing
what it's supposed to.
So they're going to adjust it,
try something else.
That's all?
That's all.
Are you sure?
I'm sure.
Because...
You could tell me, you know?
There.
Everything will be fine, Conor.
You'll see.
Wait! Wait up, Conor.
Where are you going?
Don't touch him.
Don't touch him?
With such a punchable face?
I said don't touch him.
O'Malley and I have an understanding.
I am the only one who touches him.
Isn't that right?
Now tell me,
why is it every time that I turn around,
you're there looking at me?
Getting a bit odd,
don't you think?
Sorry, that was a bit harsh.
Life's not really going
your way today, is it?
I have a house to show.
I'm trusting you here alone
until your father shows up.
I'm not five years old.
This is the correct time.
Not the one on your phone,
or on the computer,
not even on the news.
It was my mother's,
your great-grandmother's.
Perfect time keeping
for over a hundred years.
Conor, pick up your rucksack!
I don't want your father to think
I'm keeping you in a pigsty.
Not much chance of that.
Now, when you go to the hospital,
your father may not notice
how tired your mum is getting, Ok?
So we have to make sure
that he doesn't overstay his welcome.
Not that that's
historically been a problem.
No eggs. You've already
had eggs twice this week.
If you get hungry, there's spinach
in the fridge which you can steam.
Yes, sure.
Don't touch anything.
I'll do my very best not to.
Get in!
Dad.
How you doing? You look tired.
I'm fine.
Mum's on this new medicine.
It'll make her better.
She goes into hospital once
every two weeks and them...
and they pump the medicine
into her bloodstream.
She is sick for the next few days,
but she is better again.
Hey your...
Your sister's doing better.
Half-sister.
Yeah.
I'd still love you to meet her.
I've been talking with your grandma
about bringing you out to LA.
You want me to come to LA?
Yeah, absolutely!
You would you like that, wouldn't you?
Yeah.
We were thinking over Christmas.
You can be back here in time for school.
So you mean just for a visit, then?
Yeah, but it would be great.
I don't want to live with Grandma.
It's an old lady's house,
with old lady's things.
You can't touch anything
or sit anywhere.
You can't leave a mess
for two seconds.
Conor, I know, but...
I want to have my own room in
my own house, my own things.
You wouldn't have that in America Conor. There
is barely enough room for the three of us.
I don't care!
Conor, listen.
She is so strict.
Your family,
your life, your friends...
Her house is like a museum!
Your school, all of it is here, Ok?
It'd be unfair to take you out of it.
Unfair to who?
Conor.
Doesn't look like
your grandma's home yet.
She sometimes goes back
to the hospital,
after I go to bed.
The nurses let her sleep in a chair.
Just because your grandmother doesn't like me,
doesn't make her a bad person.
She says you're all start
and no finish.
Well, she is entitled
to her own opinion.
How long are you here for?
As long as I can be.
What does that mean?
We don't have a lot of money and...
Americans don't get a lot of holidays.
You're not American.
No, but I live there now.
I'll come back whenever I need to.
And you are gonna come to LA
for Christmas.
In your cramped house,
where there's no room for me.
Conor!
Why did you come?
Conor, wait!
Conor, I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?
There's still loads of time!
As destruction goes,
that was remarkably pitiful.
Now, I have come to tell you
the second tale.
Is this as bad as the last one?
It ends with proper destruction,
if that's what you mean.
It's about a man
who thought only of himself.
A man who wasn't as generous
as he should have been.
A man who gets punished
very badly indeed.
Stories aren't real though.
They don't help anything.
Stories are wild creatures,
Conor O'Malley.
When you let them loose, who knows
what havoc they might wreak?
Oh, yes!
Ok.
Go on, then.
Good.
<font color="#00ffff"><i>150 years ago,</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>the future came.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Factories grew in the landscape
like weeds.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Trees fell,</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>rivers blackened and the sky
choked on smoke and ash.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>But there was still green,</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>if you knew where to look.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>On the edge of this town
lived a stubborn man.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>who refused to change.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>He dealt in the old ways
of medicine,</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>herbs and barks and concoctions
brewed from berries and leaves.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Villagers only ever called him
the apothecary.</i></font>
The what?
<font color="#00ffff"><i>The apothecary.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>An old fashion name
for pharmacist.</i></font>
Why didn't you just say?
<font color="#00ffff"><i>There was also a young parson
in this village,</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>An enlightened man.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>and a kind one who just wanted
the very best for his congregation.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>He preached against the apothecary's
use of the old ways,</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>and the apothecary's
foul temper and greed</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>made certain some of these sermons
fell on eager ears.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Much as he tried
to keep on helping the community,</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>his business sank,</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>which only made him grow bitter.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>On the parsonage grounds
there also lived a yew tree.</i></font>
That's the hill where you live.
<font color="#00ffff"><i>The yew tree is the most important
of all the healing trees.</i></font>
Why?<font color="#00ffff"><i>
Its berries, its bark,</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>they thrum and burn
and twist with life.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>It can cure almost any ailment.</i></font>
<i>Really? Anything?</i>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Anything that can be cured,
if mixed by the right apothecary.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>The apothecary wanted
the yew tree very badly.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>But in order to harvest these things,
he would have to cut it down.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>And this, the parson would not allow.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>The parson had two daughters
who were the light of his life.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>He was a caring, loving father,</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>who'd have done anything
for their sake.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>But one day, both little girls
were struck by a terrible sickness,</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>and nothing the parson did helped.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>No cure from the more modern doctors,</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>no prayer, nothing.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>There was no choice,</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>but to approach the apothecary.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>'Will you not help my daughters?'</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>the parson begged.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>'Will you not save two innocent girls?'</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>'Why should I?', said the apothecary.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>'You have driven away my business
with your preachings</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>and you have refused me the yew tree,
my best source of healing.'</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>'You may have the yew tree',
said the parson.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>'I will preach sermons in your favor.'</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>'I will do anything if you
would only save my daughters.'</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>'You would give up everything you believed in?'</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>said the apothecary.</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>'If it would save them,
I would give up everything.'</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>'Then there is nothing
I can do to help you.'</i></font>
<font color="#00ffff"><i>The very next day,
both of the parson's daughters died.</i></font>
What?
That night, I came walking.
Good! He deserves
all the punishment he gets!
Indeed.
It was shortly after midnight
that I tore the parson's home
from its very foundations.
The parson?
What are you talking about?
The apothecary's the evil one.
He was greedy and rude,
but he was still a healer.
The parson? What was he?
A man of faith without faith.
Belief is half of all healing.
Belief in the cure.
Belief in the future that awaits.
Your belief is valuable,
so you must be careful
where you put it,
and in whom.
Tell me, Conor O'Malley.
What shall I destroy next?
What?
It is most satisfying, I can assure you.
Come on! Tell me!
What should I destroy?
Snap the chimney?
The chimney!
Next!
Throw away their beds!
Smash the furniture!
Break the windows!
Windows.
Break them yourself.
Come on!
Harder, Conor O'Malley!
Come on!
Harder!
That's it, that's it!
Yes!
Feels good, doesn't it?
Yes!
Grandma.
Grandma.
Grandma.
Grandma, please...
Grandma.
How do you like them sunny side up?
What are you doing here?
What do you think?
Grandma called very early this morning.
She's gone to the hospital
to see your mum.
She has had a bad turn.
I need to see her.
We'll see what happens today
and maybe you can visit
for a little while this afternoon.
I can see how upset you are.
I didn't mean to.
I don't know what happened.
Worse things happen at sea.
What does that mean?
Aren't you going to punish me?
What could possibly be the point in that?
I gotta say, champ, this is
really just amazingly thorough.
Buried treasure!
These must be those...
The home movies your mum used
to send to me when I moved away.
Why did you move away?
We were young.
Too young.
We had big dreams, and...
What kind of dreams?
Well, your mum wanted
to go to Art college.
Really?
Yeah.
She didn't go, but she wanted to.
What happened?
Because Mum got pregnant with me.
Hey.
Mum never regretted having you.
You were only ever good news.
And I know that for a fact,
because the one thing she regretted,
was marrying me.
Why did she marry you, then?
Because I'm handsome.
Your mum was amazing,
and she still is.
And we were in love.
I mean, I still love her.
But, you see, the...
Love isn't enough.
It doesn't carry you through.
So, you didn't get happily ever after.
No, but that's life, you know.
Most of us just get messily ever after.
And that's alright.
But I'm happy you turned out like her.
Mrs Chandler.
Because his education
is really important!
You're telling me now what to do.
So I'm pulled in every direction.
You can take him out.
You can take him out of school then...
Thank you.
I'm gonna go and find something to eat.
You want anything, kid?
I want you to stop calling me kid.
Fair enough.
I'm sorry, Lizzy.
Who was that man in the suit?
Just...
Nothing.
What happened this morning?
Nothing.
It's fine.
Just had a bit of a bad reaction.
But there's one more thing
they're gonna try, and it's...
it's a medicine that's had
some really good results.
Why didn't they try it
in the first place?
Because this is something you take
when the other stuff hasn't
worked the way they want it to.
Does that mean it's too late?
No, of course it doesn't mean
it's too late.
Are you sure?
I believe every word I say.
Belief is half of all healing.
Belief in the cure,
belief in the future that awaits.
Yeah.
You know that tree
that I'm always going on about?
Yeah.
Well, this drug is made
from trees like that.
It is?
Yeah!
Seriously?
All this time, we could have gone
out there and just chopped it down.
But not that one.
That one's our friend.
Where are you?
I'm here.
So can you do it?
Can you make my mum better?
If your mother can be healed,
the yew tree will do it.
So that's a yes?
You still don't know
why you called me.
I didn't call you.
And even if I did,
it was obviously for my mum.
Was it?
Why else?
To listen to idiotic stories
that make no sense?
It is not yet time for the third tale.
But soon.
And after that, you will tell me
your story, Conor O'Malley.
No!
No, not this!
That's just a nightmare!
No, please!
That's not my truth!
That's just a nightmare!
Nevertheless, this is
what will happen after the third tale.
I want to know what's going
to happen with my mum.
You waste the precious time
that is given to you.
Wait! Where are you going?
You're a tree of healing.
I need you to heal!
And so I shall.
Conor, I'll come back.
I promise.
All right? And you'll come
to LA for Christmas.
I don't want to leave Mum
on her own for Christmas.
Conor, this medicine your mum's taking...
it's going to make her well.
No, Conor. It probably isn't.
Yes, it is.
No, it's a last-ditch effort, son.
It'll heal her, Ok?
I know it.
It's the reason it came, it has to be.
Reason what came?
The monster.
Conor, what?
It comes at 12.07.
At first I thought it was a dream,
but there's always...
Conor, stop it. All right.
It's a dream.
That's all it is.
I'm sorry you have to face this,
but you have to be brave.
Do you understand?
Come on.
Come on.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
What if it's not fast enough?
Conor, listen...
it's Ok.
What's Ok?
Just...
You don't have to.
<i>Look.
Can you see? Can you see?</i>
<i>Can you wave?</i>
<i>Can you see him?</i>
<i>Look, then we wave to Grandma.</i>
<i>Hello, Grandma!</i>
<i>Con, can you say hello
to Grandma and Mum?</i>
<i>Hello, Grandma!</i>
<i>There we go.</i>
<i>Mummy's heard this one a lot.</i>
<i>Ok, you ready?</i>
<i>Con, look, sit, come sit here.</i>
<i>Con, look.</i>
<i>Hello, Grandma.
Mummy and...</i>
<i>There we go.</i>
<i>We're doing you a picture, Grandma.</i>
<i>And then mix it together.</i>
<i>What colour is that?</i>
<i>Brown.
Yeah!</i>
<i>It's a nice sludgy brown.</i>
<i>But we have brown here.
That's true.</i>
<i>What can you see?</i>
<i>What's that? What are those?</i>
<i>What are these?</i>
<i>The eyes.
The eyes, that's it.</i>
<i>Life is always in the eyes.</i>
<i>If you get that,</i>
<i>you'll be a proper artist.</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>Look.</i>
<i>This is how we draw the eyes in.</i>
<i>This is where the eyes
catch the reflection.</i>
<i>Then we see the life
in the eyes, see that?</i>
<i>Do it again.</i>
<i>It's life.</i>
<i>Maybe if we take a pencil,</i>
<i>and you can draw on there...</i>
<i>Do you want to try it?</i>
<i>Show me how you do it.</i>
<i>Look, Con.</i>
<i>That's his hair.</i>
<i>And this is his eyebrow.</i>
<i>There's the eyes.</i>
<i>Oh, look, there's his mouth.</i>
<i>There's his mouth,
he's very angry.</i>
<i>Can you see?</i>
<i>Look at that!</i>
<i>And then we start to make</i> a face.
<i>And then...</i>
<i>There's our monster.</i>
<i>There's the monster.</i>
<i>Look at the monster.</i>
Very slowly.
That's it.
It's a thirty-minute exam
this morning,
and this is all the stuff we've
been doing for the last two weeks.
So, if you've done your revision,
there won't be any surprises.
In a moment I'm going
to ask you to turn your pages over
and there will be no talking
for the next thirty minutes.
I want total silence in here,
because you're going to be using
your brains, not your mouths.
So, thirty minutes, starting now.
Good luck.
I think I've finally figured you out.
After all this time.
All that you are looking for
is someone to kick your head in.
But you know what?
I'm not that guy anymore.
Goodbye, O'Malley.
I no longer see you.
Now you are invisible to me too.
I hope your mum gets better.
What took you so long?
It is time for the third tale.
There was once an invisible man,
who had grown tired of being unseen.
It was not that he was
actually invisible.
It was just that people
had become used to not seeing him.
One day, the invisible man
couldn't stand it anymore.
He kept wondering:
if no one sees you,
are you really there at all?
What did the invisible man do?
He called for a monster.
I don't even know
what to say to you, O'Malley.
You sent him to hospital!
His parents are threatening to sue.
It wasn't me.
What was that?
It wasn't me.
I'm not invisible!
I'm not invisible!
If you want to be seen,
this is not the best way.
I'm not invisible!
Did you hear me?
I'm not invisible!
School rules dictate
immediate exclusion.
But how could I do that,
and consider myself
any kind of teacher?
Go back to class.
We will talk about this one day,
but not today.
You're not punishing me?
What could possibly be the point?
Let me give you an example
of emotional wellness.
You know how difficult it is
sometimes to say no, right?
How good it feels when you
finally find the courage to say it.
Why is that?
Aren't you coming?
I'll be right here.
What did you do to your hands?
This is the talk, isn't it?
Everybody wants to have a talk lately.
Con.
Look at me.
I spoke to the doctor this morning.
The new treatment,
it's not working.
The one from the yew tree?
Yeah.
How can it not be working?
Things have just moved really fast.
Faster than they thought.
But how can it not be working?
I don't know.
It has to.
So what happens now?
What's gonna be the next treatment?
I'm so sorry.
I've never been more sorry,
about anything in my life.
It's Ok that you're angry, Con.
It really is.
I'm pretty angry too,
to tell you the truth.
But, Con...
Con, are you listening?
One day,
if you look back and you feel bad
for being so angry,
you couldn't even speak to me,
you have to know that that was Ok,
that I knew.
Because I know everything
you need to tell me
without you having to say it out loud.
And if you need to break things,
by God, you break them.
Break them, good and hard.
And I'll be right there, Con.
I wish I had a hundred years.
A hundred years I could give to you.
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
I don't care what time it is!
You lied!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
I need you now!
You will do yourself harm
if you keep that up.
It didn't work!
You said the yew tree would
make her better, but it didn't!
Fix her! Make her better!
Conor!
You were the one who called me,
Conor O'Malley.
If I called you, it was to save her!
It was to heal her!
I did not come to heal her.
Yes, you did!
I came to heal you.
Me?
I'm not the one who needs healing!
How many times do I have to tell you?
My mum's the one who.
Help me.
It is time for the fourth tale.
No!
No, please! Get me out of here!
It is time for your nightmare.
I need to get back to my mum!
She is already here.
No!
Mum, get out of here!
I'm fine!
It's all right.
There's nothing to worry about.
Mum, run! Please, run!
Mum!
Mum!
Conor!
Mum!
Mum!
Mum!
Conor!
Mum!
Don't let me go!
I won't!
Conor!
Mum!
Conor!
Mum!
Conor!
Here is the fourth tale.
Help!
Here is the truth of Conor O'Malley.
Here is your nightmare.
Mum!
Mum!
Mum!
Mum!
This is when I wake up.
This is when I always wake up.
The tale is not yet told.
Get me out of here!
I need to see my mum!
She is no longer here, Conor.
She fell. I couldn't hold on
to her anymore.
Conor!
Speak the truth!
No!
You must speak the truth or you
will never leave this place.
What truth?
I don't know what you mean!
You must tell me the fourth tale,
Conor O'Malley.
You must tell me your nightmare
before it is too late.
No!
Yes!
Tell me, Conor!
Tell me the truth!
It'll kill me if I do!
It will kill you if you do not!
No!
Speak the truth!
No!
The truth, Conor O'Malley!
Tell me the truth, boy!
No!
Speak the truth!
No!
Speak the truth!
No!
Speak the truth!
No!
Speak the truth, boy!
I want it to be over!
I can't stand knowing that she'll go.
I want it to be finished.
I let her fall.
I let her die.
That was brave, Conor.
You finally said it.
Why didn't it kill me?
I deserve punishment.
I deserve the worst.
Do you?
I've known forever
that she wasn't going to make it.
She'd keep telling me
she was getting better all the time,
because that's what I wanted to hear.
And I believed her.
Except I didn't.
And I started to think
how much I wanted it to be over.
I couldn't stand how alone
it would make me feel.
A part of you wished it would end,
even if it meant losing her.
I let her go.
I could have held on for longer,
but I always let her go.
And that is your truth,
Conor O'Malley.
I don't want it to be, though.
Now it's for real.
Now she's going to die
and it's my fault.
And that is not the truth at all.
You were merely wishing
for an end of pain.
Your own pain.
It is the most human wish there is.
I didn't mean it, though.
You did, but you also did not.
How can both be true?
How can a prince be a murderer
and be loved by his people?
How can an apothecary
be evil-tempered but right-thinking?
How can invisible men make themselves
more lonely by being seen?
I don't know.
Your stories
never made any sense to me.
Because humans are complicated beasts.
You believe comforting lies
while knowing full well the painful
truth that makes those lies necessary.
In the end Conor,
it is not important what you think.
It is only important what you do.
So what do I do?
What you did just now.
You speak the truth.
That's all?
You think it's easy?
You were willing to die
rather than speak it.
I'm so tired.
So tired of all of this.
Then sleep.
There's time.
Are you sure? I need to see my mum.
We will both see her tonight.
Will you be there?
Yes.
It will be the final steps
of my walking.
How does the fourth story end?
Sleep.
Sleep.
Sleep.
Thank God!
Conor!
Conor!
I've been out of my mind
trying to find you.
There was something I had to.
No time. We have to go now.
Damn it!
Grandma.
I'm sorry.
About the sitting room and...
and everything.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.
You know, Conor?
You and me...
We are not
the most natural fit, are we?
No. I guess not.
I guess not either.
But we're going to have to learn.
I know.
You do know, don't you?
Of course you do.
But there is one thing
we have in common.
Your mum.
That's what we have in common.
It's Ok.
I see you found him.
Thank you.
Hello, my darling.
Ma?
Yes, I'm here.
I'm here. Can you feel my hand?
And Conor's here, too.
Is he?
Here is the end of the tale.
I'm afraid.
Of course you are afraid.
It will be hard.
It will be more than hard.
But you will make it through,
Conor O'Malley.
You'll stay?
I will be right here.
What do I do?
Now all that is left is for you
to speak the simplest truth of all.
I don't want you to go.
I know, my love.
I don't want you to go.

<font color="#00ffff"><i>It ends with the boy

<font color="#00ffff"><i>And by doing so,

Conor.
This is your room now.
I've been making it ready.
Thank you.
