Dad, what's happening?
l need you to listen to me
like we're the last two people on the planet,
okay, Nick?
Someday a girl is going
to give you a flower.
You got that? A flower.
And you have to help her, Nick.
You help her and you help us all.
Okay?
l know it doesn't make any sense right now,
but l believe the woman who told me that.
You think you could believe me?
l love you.
l always said you were special, Nick.
Turns out l was right.
(BEEPS)
Division's here, Nick. Just keep moving.
And don't make any decisions
that any watcher can track.
(GASPS)
(SlGHS)
(MEN SHOUTlNG)
l just wanted to have a conversation.
(GUN FlRlNG)
(SlGHS)
What a waste.
Bring his body to the lab.
CASSIE: There are speciaI
people in this world.
We don' t ask to be special.
We' re just born this way.
We pass you on the streets every day,
unnoticed by m'ost.
It started in 1945.
The NaZis were conducting experim'ents
in psychic warfare,
trying to turn those with psychic abilities
into soIdiers.
Lots of us died.
The War ended,
but the experim'ents never stopped.
Other governm'ents around the World
set up what they called ' ' Divisions,' '
trying to do what the NaZis couldn' t,
to turn us into weapons.
The Division' s agents are trained
to track and hunt us doWn like animals,
take us away from' our fam'ilies and friends.
WOMAN 1 : There are children stuffed aWay
all over the worId.
CASSIE: They test us and categoriZe us.
l' m' what they call a ' ' watcher.' '
We can see the future, even if that's
not always as sim'ple as it sounds.
NEWSCASTER 1 : Tonight,
a jum'bo jet crashed.
There are no reports of survivors.
CASSIE: Others are called "m'overs," just an
easy way of saying ' ' telekinetic.' '
NEWSCASTER 2: Much of the building
collapsed after about two hours,
leaving only a brick wall.
' ' Pushers' '  put thoughts in your head
and m'ake whatever lie
they com'e up with the truth.
WOMAN 2: They'd already begun
to control m'y m'ind...
NEWSCASTER 3: The president...
(MAN SPEAKING FRENCH)
(SHOUTlNG)
CASSIE: "Sniffs," "shifters," "shadoWs,"
' ' bleeders,' '  it goes on and on.
ln Division' s eyes, we' re all just lab rats.
Only one problem': We keep dying.
NEWSCASTER 4:
The evidence shows that the kids
were given m'ilk with radioactive iodine.
CASSIE: No one has ever survived
the drug m'eant to boost our powers.
My nam'e is Cassie Holm'es.
Division took m'y m'om' from' m'e.
Right now the future l see
doesn' t look so great.
The good news is
the future is always changing
in the largest of ways
by the sm'allest of things.
They' ve been winning a lot of battles.
Now it's our turn to win the war.

She survived the injection.
She's our patient Zero.
Bring me every sniffer we have.
But she's on foot. She can't get far.
She'll get help

Do whatever is necessary
to get her and that syringe back! Now!

HOLDEN: What you say there, Nick?
-NlCK: Who are you?
-We're with Division.
Like you didn't know.
-Go to hell.
-Easy, son.
lf we wanted you,
you'd be in the back of a van.
You gonna invite us in
or are we gonna have to be rude?
Smart move, living in a shithole like this.
One on top of the other.
Took you far off the radar.
Not far enough.
(SNlFFS)
Would you believe
this is how we found you?
From your old toothbrush
from that encounter 1 0 years ago.
Barely a scent left.
Thought you were in Tokyo.
Then Malaysia.
Finally we got a few readings
on some buildings.
(SNlFFlNG)
There's a lot of runaway psychics
in Hong Kong trying to disappear, Nick.
People with no country, no loyalty...
No desire to get involved
in political bullshit.
(RESONATlNG)
Nobody but you in this apartment
for a long time, Nick.
Why? You looking for someone
besides me?
A girl. She has something belonging to us.
Better than a hunch you know her.
Obviously l don't.
(SNlFFlNG)
ln case we need to get a hold of you again.
l've got some old toilet paper
you boys might like more.
HOLDEN: Don't bother running, Nick.
We know where you are now.
Shit.
(PHONE RlNGlNG)
-Yeah?
-CASSIE: Hey, Nick.
-Who is this?
-Open up, Nick.
(KNOCKlNG AT DOOR)
And put your gun down.
(GUN COCKS)
Put that thing away. Got you something.
Where's the chicken l saw? There it is.
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa! Excuse me?
This is how you treat your guests?
This is how l treat random strangers
who barge into my apartment.
Like the Division sniffers
who were just here?
Who are you?
l'm Cassie.
l'm here to help you.
Listen, Cassie,
l'm sure your mom and dad are nervous
about you right now, so why don't you...
-You don't understand.
-You got that right.
This is about us finding $6 million.
That's us.
And that's our money.
And that's my toothbrush.
You're a watcher.
So is there a place we can get
something to eat besides chicken?
l'm buying.
Lose a bet with your hairdresser?
l like color.
First things first.
l know you're a second-generation mover.
ls that what the kids are calling it
these days?
l'll let you know when l see one.
You don't really use your powers,
which means you haven't practiced,
so you kind of suck at it.
How am l doing so far?
-Go on.
-l'm a watcher.
Second generation, like you.
-Wow, that's...
-Complicated.
'Cause the future can change
just by talking about it.
So l see glimpses and l draw it in my book.
But l'm not really good at it.
l'm kind of a crappy artist,
but l'm sure you already knew that.
But l got the sniffs
in your apartment right.
That's why l brought you a new toothbrush.
(SPEAKlNG CANTONESE)
You speak Chinese?
Cantonese. l'm surprised
you didn't know that, being a watcher.
l get things wrong sometimes.
l know the feeling.
Are you worried about the thugs
you owe money to? Don't.
Thank you. We'll be able to
take care of it in a couple of days.
-With your $6 million.
-Mmm-hmm.
Where's the money?
lt's on its way here. With a girl.
Don't tell me. The same girl
Division sniffs are looking for.
-lt's Cassie, right?
-Mmm-hmm.
Enjoy your food.
-That's it?
-That's it.
Sorry. Some 1 2-year-old
that knew l needed a new toothbrush
isn't enough to get me involved
with Division. Even if it's not a con.
l'm 1 3.
And l've been told that l look at least 14.
(CHUCKLES) Right.
And this is not a con.
This is a way for everyone to get
something that they want.
l've actually used that line before.
Fine. Don't believe me.
But you will help me.
Really? 'Cause l'm getting a message.
lt's telling me, "Find somebody else."
lf we don't find the case and that girl,
really bad things happen, Nick.
What? What's wrong?
(lNAUDlBLE)
Shit. They're here in the market.
Who? Who?
They're in the market! Come on!
-Division?
-Bleeders! We got to get out of here!
-How does this end?
-l have no idea.
POP FATHER: Where is the girl?
My daughter has already seen you with her.
Told you.
Look, l told three people already today,
l don't know this girl.
Stupid child. l already saw how you die.
Then you know it's not here
and it's not today.
(ALL EXCLAlMlNG)

(GRUNTlNG)
(SPEAKlNG CANTONESE)
(STOPS SCREAMlNG)
l already know you're here.
You must be Cassie Holmes.
Who sent you?
Your mother.
A week before
she was captured by Division,
she told me to be at that fish market today.
Stay away from him.
lf that's what you want. Just be sure
to add his picture to the Wall of the Dead.
-You're a stitch.
-That should be obvious to a watcher,
if you had even a modicum
of your mother's talent.
l've been dealing with a lot.
Years ago your mother did me a favor.
Now it would seem
l need to pay off my debt.
l hear they've got your mother buried
deep inside Division.
Have her so drugged up
she can't even hold a spoon.
l bet they suck the future right out of her.
(GASPS)
(GRUNTlNG)
You help her and you help us all.
(GRUNTlNG)
A fIower...
ls he okay?
(PANTlNG)
You okay?
Yeah.
(SlGHS)
Wow. That woman's got magic fingers.
For you.
What is that?
lt's a lotus.
l heard what she said about your mother.
You did?
Division's got her.
They locked her up because she's
the greatest watcher they've ever seen.
And they're afraid of her,
and they're afraid they can't control her.
They killed my father for the same reason.
But l guess you already knew that.
l see the future, not the past.
And right now our future isn't that great.
That's new?
Now those sniffs from your apartment
are going to get the girl and the case.
lt's changed.
l don't know why.
Just something l did, a mistake l made.
Doesn't matter. lt just... Just has.
My mother told me that that case
is the key to bringing down Division
and freeing her.
There's no money in that case, is there?
Well, unless l'm missing something,
they don't have the case yet.
(GROANS)
lt's still out there.
lf your mother's such a great fortune-teller,
how did she get caught?
l'm just going to
have to ask her that myself.
l haven't even gotten to the bad part yet.
What is that?
We die.
(SCOFFS) Great.
Hello, Kira.
-You have a plane to catch. Come on.
-You want to come with us.
Christ. Get a load of that.
She must use that, like, 1 0 times a day.
That's a keeper.
You're not gonna be having a lot of lipstick
opportunities where you're going,
you know what l mean?
She's doing it again.
-Get the hell out of my head!
-No! No!
What does she want?
She's got to go to the bathroom.
To throw up or something.
Carver will kill us
if anything happens to her.
-Bathroom?
-This way.
MACK: Come on.
Coffee, black, no sugar.
All right. ln you go.
(SlGHS)
You're a good man, Agent Mack.
l bet you come from a good family.
lt must have been hard for you
when he died.
Who died?
Your brother.
-l don't have a brother, sweetheart.
-No, you do.
l've got something
that will make you feel better.
And you loved him very much.
But he was murdered.
And you know who did it, don't you?
KIRA: But he was m'urdered.
And you know who did it, don' t you?
(PEOPLE SCREAMlNG)
KlRA: And you know who did it, don' t you?
But he was m'urdered.

The lollipop chick freaks me out.
-She's a watcher.
-Like you.
Yeah.
Hey, l know this place. This is...
l know this place.
Club B, boss. Science Museum Road.
Thank you.
Why is that olive out of the glass?
(SNlCKERS) That's not an olive. lt's a bead.
lt's a bead?
Yeah, it's a bead.
lt's a shimmery shimmer l did there.
Well, it looks like a pimento.
lf l was going to draw a bead, l'd...
lt's a bead with a shimmer.
What does the bead have to do with it?
l don't know what the shiny,
shimmery bead has to do with it.
Great.
All right. Well, let's keep it simple.
We'll start with the bead
and see where it takes us.
Sounds like a plan,
but what about the part where we die?
l remember growing up together.
Where we went to school. How he died.
So except for this brother you never had,
is there anything else
she might have put in your head?
l'm only asking because
l don't want to be shot in the face
for screwing some made-up sister
you don't really have.
l don't have a sister?
Agent Mack, you are relieved of duty.
Get on a plane, eat some peanuts,
and go home.
She won't push me again, sir.
She just caught me off guard.
The only thoughts in my head are my own.
-You're willing to risk your life on that?
-Yes, sir.
Then put the gun in your mouth
and pull the trigger.
CARVER: Don't worry.
You already checked it. lt's not loaded.
Spread these beads to any sniff,
any watcher,
any goddamn expatriate reader
in Hong Kong who knows up from down
(GUN FlRES)
till we find Kira.
What about the Chinese government
and their guys?
The story's out. Bleeders all over
the country will be looking for her.
We can't let them get the drug.
CARVER: So we put a price on her head.
Yeah, this is it. Hey, can you...
l just... l don't have any...
Yeah, sure. l got it.
There you go. You can keep it. Thanks.
NlCK: How much do you have?
-Don't give him all of that.
-lt's not enough.
-lt's enough.
-lt's not gonna be enough.
-Just give me the...
-lt's enough.
-Excuse me, sir?
-Hey. We need five minutes.
Now, listen, this is a place for grown-ups,
so behave yourself.
Shut up.
That sounds about right.

What's going on? Sit down.
-WAlTRESS: Vodka martini?
-Thank you.
l'll have one of those.
She'll have a Coke.
My mom drinks when she wants to get
really clear images. She's famous for it.
Maybe something without caffeine.
l've got it. Whoa.
WATERS: That's five.
-Keep the change.
-Thank you.
l know who you are.
When l was in Division, her mother was
at the top of every watch list there was.
You worked for Division?
You want to know about Division?
Ten years. No thank you, no pension.
l was put out on the street
with a threat to not shift again.
Only the sniffs caught up with me
in Chicago.
l was just trying to buy something nice
for my wife.
Next day l get a call, she's dead.
Car accident.
But my wife doesn't drive.
But l don't have to remind you
how that feels, right?
We need this.
An olive?
lt's a bead.
lt's supposed to lead us to someone
we need to find before Division does.
Excuse me! May l?
(WOMAN GROANS)
Thank you.
You're welcome.
WATERS: Got it right?
lt's a little more round and shinier.
That's it. That's just how l saw it.
WATERS: lt won't last long.
l'd take it to Emily Hu. She's an expat sniff.
Only works by referral. Here's her address.
Thank you, Hook.
Bye-bye.
Good luck.

(KNOCKlNG AT DOOR)
May l help you?
Hook Waters sent us.
A bead that looks like this one
is supposed to lead us to a girl.
(SlGHS)
You with Division?
Are you looking at us?
The truth is, the girl who dropped that bead
is supposed to have a suitcase
that will bring down Division.
Cassie here thinks
that if we don't find it, we die.
(SNlCKERS) And you believe her?
(SlGHS) She's pretty convincing.
Well, consider me unconvinced.
-Well, looks like we've just got to wait.
-For what?
You have about one minute to help us.
And what's that?
That's your poster.
-That's the bead.
-That's the clock. lt's right now...
You got about a minute.
(CHUCKLES)
You guys can't be serious.
(CHUCKLES) Don't look at me. This girl's
been going at it with that pen all day.
Everything that ends up on this pad
seems to be coming true.
l just see it
like l'm looking at a photograph.
Look, we want Division out of Hong Kong
just as much as you do.
lt's going to be a whole lot easier
if you help us find the girl.
(SPEAKlNG CANTONESE)
Fine.
They've been spreading these
all over the city.
(SNlFFS)
EMlLY: You' ll find who you' re looking for
on Kwun Tong Pier.
(PEOPLE SPEAKlNG CANTONESE)
Excuse me!
Excuse me. Speak any English?
-No.
-No?
lt doesn't really matter. l just need a ride.
KlRA: We're old friends, right?
(SPEAKlNG CANTONESE)
l know. l should have called.
l should have called.
Whoa, whoa!
-Kira?
-Damn it!
-What the hell are you doing here?
-There goes my ride!
-Don't.
-Don't? Don't what?
You're the girl everyone's looking for?
-l should kill you, Nick.
-Hey!
You know this psycho?
-What happened to you?
-Now you want to know?
What is that supposed to mean?
l thought you left.
You stopped returning my calls.
Division caught me and locked me up.
-What?
-And you never came.
l looked for you. l did!
You didn't find me.
Done! Whatever, you had a thing.
Get over it.
l really suggest we discuss this
somewhere else.
(SlRENS WAlLlNG)
Let's go, Nick.
Kira. Division's looking for you.
They're looking for the case.
And so are you.
What's in that case, Kira?
l don't know.
All l know is that l woke up on a boat
next to a note l'd written
saying to look for you
and you'd help me find the case.
l don't remember anything
about the last couple of days,
no matter how hard l try.
You must have had yourself wiped.
Erased memories make it harder
for Division to track you.
Not the ones of you.
Can l talk to you for a sec?
Can it wait?
l'm kind of in the middle of something.
No.
You, me, and my mom.
l've never seen my mom's death before.
lt's her, Nick.
She's changing the future,
and she's making it worse.
-We've got to dump her.
-Dump her? Cassie, we...
Cassie, we just found her.
And she doesn't have the case.
Which is what we're looking for,
-if you remember.
-Yeah, l know.
We find her, we find the case.
The three of us.
Yeah, and then Division finds her.
Yeah, the three of us.
We'll get a shadow, so they can't trace her.
-Satisfied?
-No.
Cassie, you got to trust me.
Hey, l'm not the one
with the trust issues here.
You better do something quick,
'cause l'm getting sick
of drawing dead bodies.
That's him.
-Hey, Pinky.
-Hey, Nick.
How you doing?
All right, who's feeling the heat?
All right.
Here's how this works. l get 1 0 grand
a day for shadowing Miss Trouble.
As long as she stays within 20 feet
of me, no sniff is gonna find her.
l don't care if they're standing right on top
of us and have a piece of her fingernail.
-Happy?
-Overcome.
Come on. Let's find a place to think.
So, Pinky, your wife give you that name?
No, the Division did, sweetheart.
Back in the day.
(SlGHS) l'm sorry.
l can't remember anything about the case.
Shocking.
(TOlLET FLUSHlNG)
Can l clean up without getting killed?
PlNKY: Don't forget
to wash behind your ears.
Nice girlfriend you got there.
Yeah. She used to be.
NlCK: l met her running cons
on Coney lsland tourists.
(CHUCKLES) We did everything together.
Everything.
CASSlE: So we're just gonna sit around
and wait for her to get her memory back,
and hope that she'll tell us
where the case is before Carver gets it?
Or us.
Great plan.
Where you going?
l saw a chicken place downstairs.
Want to come?
No, l'm good.
l want to stay here, see if l can help.
Have fun with that.
Where you going?
(SNlCKERS)
Relax, Romeo.
l can shade herjust fine out in the hall.
l don't need to be a watcher
to see where this is going.
(CONSEQUENCE PLAYING)
Leave m'e paralyzed, love
Leave m'e hypnotiZed, love
Sorry about that.
l thought the bathroom was on fire.
l had to get you to come in somehow.
Did you push me?
You didn't like it?
Push back.
Leave m'e paralyzed, love
(HUMMlNG)
My father expects me to find that suitcase.
So does my mother.
But you don't see it clearly, do you?
Too many things keep changing.
l already saw how you die.
Did you see it yet?
You can change it, you know.
Plenty of planes leaving Hong Kong
every day.
We are going to change it.
You put a shadow on the girl.
You know that's only temporary.
That girl is the one who brings
all your little fantasy crashing down.
So tell Nick something for me, little girl.
Tell him my family going to make
his brain pop like a tomato.
Tell him that's the future l see.
Oh, boy.
Hello?
There you are.
Where is the chicky-chicky
who gets us all killed?
-Are you drunk?
-Yeah.
l'm sorry. l didn't know the procedure
for stopping a blitzed 1 0-year-old.
l'm 1 3! And l am powering my use!
l... l can't believe this.
l am working.
You... You screw it all up!
All right. Give me this. What is this?
We talked about this, Cassie.
Nobody is going anywhere.
-What is this?
-You don't get it, Nick.
She is the one that kills us all, basically.
NlCK: Then l guess
we're all gonna get killed.
CASSlE: Yeah. Screwed up.
By "we," do you mean not...
You, too.
Pop Girl's a better watcher than l am.
Whoa! No one said anything
about a watcher.
l can only work long-term
against the sniffs.
-Good.
-No. True story.
You got a watcher after you,
it's just a matter of time.
All right. Then we'll split up.
We'll give her two things to track
instead of one.
Pinky, you take Kira somewhere safe...
No. l'm not going with him. No offense.
None taken, cupcake.
l know you're sweet on the champ.
l'll find you.
NlCK: Let's let her sleep for a bit.
(SCREAMlNG SHRlLLY)
(SPEAKlNG CANTONESE)
She saw me coming.
(SPEAKlNG CANTONESE)
She still dies!
She's gone, you know.
l'm just saying.
(GROANS)
You okay?
No. Not until we find that case.
When was the last time you saw it?
Not since yesterday.
Not for lack of trying, though.
lf we don't find it soon,
they're gonna kill my mom.
And it's gonna be my fault.
Look at me.
Hey! Look at me.
You really think l'm gonna let that happen?
Now, you said
the future's always changing, right?
lt can change just by knowing it?
lt can change. lt doesn't mean it will.
-Good enough.
-What are you doing?
What are you gonna go do?
l'm gonna try and make a better one.
Going after Carver
doesn't change anything.
lt doesn't save me, it doesn't save you,
it doesn't save her.
lt's just a matter of time, Cassie.
lf l don't go to him, he'll come for us.
Emily, it's Nick.
Listen, Division sent a pusher
named Carver to Hong Kong.
l need you to find him.
Just use that bead they gave you.
l'm sure his hands were all over it.
(SPEAKlNG CANTONESE)
l'm not hungry.
(GUNS COCKlNG)
Henry Carver.
Now there's a face
l haven't seen in a long time.
Sit down.
The food is actually pretty good here.
Give me one good reason
not to kill you right now.
(SlGHS)
Good.
Gonna try and get inside my head?
Go ahead. See if you can push me
before l pull the trigger.
Wow. Ten years is a long time
to hold a grudge.
My father would disagree.
You piece of shit.
Your father l had respect for.
He took a stand with great integrity, which
is more than anyone can say about you.
lf this is your attempt at...
CARVER: Think l don't know
this future, huh?
l've got 20 of the best watchers in the world
tracking every moment of this time
right now.
You die, Nick. You all die.
You know who doesn't?
-Me.
-You sure about that?
Okay.
Kira is our patient Zero.
And with her we're going to create
an army the world's never seen before.
l'm sorry. Am l supposed to care?
Fine. Fuck patriotism.
The girl will die unless she receives
the necessary injections.
And you're not going to find it
anywhere but with me.
Maybe you care about that.
Tell me something, Nick.
Her blood turn black yet?
No? lnsides running out?
Or is she keeping that away from you, too?
l'll take that as a yes.
(SHUDDERlNG)

(GASPlNG)
You already know the ending to this story.
You can only draw it so many ways.
We're going to change it.
You don't believe that, do you?
Please
don't make me do anything to myself.
Hurting you would change the future.
And l like how this future goes.
So will killing him.
Victor!
(THUDDlNG)
l think l just saved your life.
No need to thank me.
You should just start listening to me.
You look like shit.
(GLOW PLAYlNG)
-NlCK: Where is she?
-5A.
-NlCK: ls she safe?
-Yeah. She's sick, though. Pretty bad.
Out of all contexts and scenery
lt shows laughter rings inside of m'e
Aching paths don' t cross so easily
Break m'y back to see things differently
Differently
So glow
l need to ask you a question.
What's in the case?
KlRA: lt' s... lt' s a drug.
Som'e sort of psychic steroid
that boosts our abilities,
but kills us.
They want m'e back
because l' m' the only one
who survived the injection.
Tell me why l just drew a picture of me
holding her shoe.
(GROANS)
ls she okay?
(KNOCKlNG AT DOOR)
What? No. You've got to be kidding me.
-NlCK: She's dying.
-You are not bringing me into this.
NlCK: You're already in it.
And we need to know
what this key unlocks. Please.
Cassie, how much do the Chinese know?
Whatever we do. lt could be more.
Their watcher is better than me.
We know there's a suitcase
with a Division drug in it.
Kira hid it somewhere in Hong Kong.
Can you draw us a way out of this?
We can't change anything
with that bitch tracking us.
-The second we do, she's gonna see it.
-What do you mean?
She sees intentions. What we decide to do.
l decide to cross the street,
so she sees me crossing the street.
What if nothing we did made sense?
Or we just kept changing our mind,
like we didn't know
exactly what we were gonna do?
Would that throw her off?
lt might, but we still have to find the case.
Whatever this key unlocks
is being shadowed.
Like l've never seen before.
lt's this way.
That really narrows it down.
lf it's shadowed, l won't be able to draw it.
There's a building missing.
l thought shadows weren't supposed to
be effective against watchers like Cassie.
We're not. We're not supposed to be able
to shade entire buildings, either.
You wanted to see me?
l'm going to need your help.
Watchers from everywhere are tracking us.
Carver, the Chinese, anything we think
we're gonna do, they know about it.
That's why we all keep dying
in Cassie's book.
-Pardon?
-You die outside an elevator.
(WATERS CLEARS THROAT)
But how are we gonna make
the future unpredictable?
By not knowing what we're gonna do
until right before we do it.
lt's like a plan without planning.
NlCK: Yes. Right. Okay.
l'll write letters to each of you
giving you specific instruction.
You don't open them until l tell you.
Then the last letter, l write to myself
and wipe the memory
of ever having written them.
That's why l need you to find
the guy that wiped Kira.
Sure thing.
That sounds like a great plan.
(SlGHS) Do you have a better one?
We're flying blind.
Yeah.
Cassie, l need one more drawing
out of you.
l need to know the exact siZe and shape
of that case. And that syringe.
(SPEAKlNG CANTONESE)
CARvER: The girl Will die unless
she receives the necessary injections.
You're not going to find the stuff
anywhere but with me.
CARvER: YoU die, Nick.
You all die.
You need the medicine that Carver has.
l'm not gonna watch you die.
l'll come back for you.
l promise.
When do l open it?
When you start to doubt the truth.
You know when to open these.
You sure this is right?
No.
Nick?
Take an umbrella. lt's gonna rain.
You be careful, too.
You make us chase you
halfway across the world,
then you let a hack like Pinky Stein
bring you in?
l'm sick.
You're sick? You don't know what you are.
Victor, pay the man.
(SlGHS) Of course.
l knew l wouldn't get paid yet. Wait here.
Were you followed?
l'm never folloWed.
All right. Where is this guy?
-Which one?
-The yelloW one.
-The big one?
-Yep.
Wo Chiang?
You are here about the girl?
You're the one that wiped Kira?
Twelve years ago, a Woman told me
an American girl Would come.
That Was two days ago, the girl showed.
l have a job for you.
Two hours ago, l wrote seven letters.
l need you to erase the memory
of ever having written them.
Seven letters, two hours of memory.
The Woman tell me those things.
She did not pay for you, too.
And when you're done,
l need you to open this and read it.
l need a minute.
As you wish.
l'm not gonna Wake up
and forget who l am, am l?
(SNlCKERS)
Wait, Wait. No, just... Go, go.
lt's all gone.
The future has disappeared.
l lost the connection.
(GASPS)
(SPEAKlNG CANTONESE)
Okay. No problem.
(EXHALES)
41 00.
(GUN FlRES)
(SPEAKlNG CANTONESE)
Thank you. You ready?
Right siZe, right shape.
No problem.
Better hurry. Won't last long.
Crap.
(GROANlNG)
The Lord giveth.
(PANTlNG)
TERESA: Did you really think
you could slip out of toWn with this?
Tell me, Was this Worth dying for?
(SNlCKERS)
No. He dies sloW.
Your sister promised me that
and a great deal of money.
Do you knoW hoW many people
in the World Would kill for this drug?
TERESA: NoW...
Where is Cassie?
Get me back on my feet.
(SPEAKlNG CANTONESE)
(CELL PHONE RlNGlNG)
Didn't see that one coming, did you?
Do you really Want to do this, little girl?
l knoW where the drug is.
More importantly, l knoW hoW you die.
Do you want to know what the tiger m'eans?
(SPEAKlNG CANTONESE)
See if that
will make him love you.
My note says l'm supposed to tell you
the Division has Kira. 21 6 Batang Street.
lt said a lot on there.
Was everyone's that complicated?
l kneW you could handle it.
This immunosuppressant
will save your life
and alloW you to reach your full potential.
You're going to be a better you, Kira.
You need to accept this reality.
CARVER: We're not trying to hurt you, Kira.
Matter of fact,
your Well-being means everything to us.
Understand it's not your fault for forgetting
who you are and running from us.
The drug has side effects.
We have no Way of knoWing the severity.
l Want you to knoW
that l blame myself for that, Agent Hollis.
This isn't real.
You volunteered, Kira. l Was against it.
CARvER: You Were certain you'd be the one
to survive the drug.
l had to support you.
After all, we were partners.
(GASPS)
Then you panicked.
Did you think you made it all the Way here
and eluded us for so long
without any training?
That's the Division in you, Kira.
NoW let me help you remember.
CARVER: NoW let me help you remember.
l keep trying to draw something different,
but l can't.
lt has something to do with hoW l die.
lt's a tiger.
l'm serious.
l don't knoW hoW l knoW, but l just knoW.
l knoW l act like l don't care sometimes,
but l don't want to die.
Cassie.
lt's not gonna happen, okay?
Just tell me that l'm a crappy artist
and that l'm wrong.
You are a crappy artist and you are wrong.
Listen to me.
You've already done more than enough
for everyone.
The only thing you got to Worry
about right noW is keeping yourself safe.
But hoW?
You just start Walking.
Don't even think about where you're going.
You just keep moving. Don't make
any decisions any Watcher can track.
And when you come across
someplace safe, you hide.
Simple as that. l don't knoW hoW,
but l knoW this is gonna Work out.
l promise. No need to be scared. Trust me.
That's more like it.
What are you gonna do?
(SlGHS)
(SNlCKERS)
l can't tell you.
(BOTTLES CRASHlNG)
(GUN COCKS)
You make me look like a fool
in front of my family!
(SCREAMlNG)
Don't Worry.
You Won't remember a thing.
Your mother's very proud.
NICK: I want to m'ake a deal.
The drug for the girl.
CARvER: Okay. Dock 4, Man Yuen Street.
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHlNG)
Where is the case, Nick?
Kira!
Go ahead.
Remember that night
under the roller coaster?
We parked in the rain
and got those little bottles of Jack.
That was the first time
you told me you loved me.
CARVER: He remembers.
l want to hear it from him.
l remember.
lt never happened.
We met for the first time yesterday.
You've never been to Coney lsland.
(SNlCKERS)
KlRA: Nobody's been to Coney lsland.
l used you, Nick.
And the quicker We find that case,
the quicker l'll let you forget it.
(CELL PHONE RlNGlNG)
You might as Well.
WATERS: My card says
you have to take the drug. Give m'e Carver.
lt's for you.
-Hello?
-You Want the case, you let them live.
l'll tell you exactly where it is.
-Another?
-Sure.
One for the road.
Don't feel too bad.
That push of Kira's
has Worked on better men.
(GRUNTS)
41 00.
Kill him.
lf that's all right with you?
POP FATHER: The case!
Agent Carver.
The contents of this case are the property
of the United States government.
Government?
We are the only government here.
Be reasonable.
There is no need for anyone to die.
We're not much for diplomacy these days.
Victor! Make me a Way out of here!
(GROANlNG)
CARVER: Kira!
NlCK: Kira!
(SCREAMlNG)
Kira.
(GRUNTlNG)
(SCREAMlNG SHRlLLY)
Whoa! l'm impressed.
The engineers are alWays conservative
with their projections,
but this is something else.
Hey! We are on the same side. Remember?
NoW why don't you march
the men who tried to kill us off this roof,
and We'll call it a day.
Wait! Kira! Don't do this!
This isn't you. lt's a push.
What Carver told you is a lie.
l'm sure they make a card for this.
(GRUNTlNG)
Where Were We? Where Were We?
-You don't want to do that.
-Watch me.
You'd be doing me a favor if you did.
What's in that needle will kill you.
l Went through hundreds of potentials
to find her.
She's our survivor.
Look at me.
You knoW me.
NlCK: And l knoW you.
Look at me.
Let him do it.
(GROANS)
What a waste.
l told you to bring an umbrella.
l thought you said it Was gonna rain.
l also told you
l get things wrong sometimes.
Maybe it will Wash the crap
out of your hair.
So where's the real case?
There it is.
HoW long do you think your mother
has been planning this?
Since before l was born.
This is the key, Nick.
Division will do anything to keep this
from getting into the wrong hands.
So We trade your mom for the drug?
l'm still Working on that one.
Hey, what Was it
that l injected myself with?
Nine Dragon Soy Sauce.
That's gross.
CASSlE: What about Kira?
NlCK: You're the watcher. You tell me.
CASSlE: Don't Worry.
We'll see Miss Trouble soon enough.
-When do l open it?
-When you start to doubt the truth.
KlRA: Put your gun in your m'outh.
Pull the trigger.
