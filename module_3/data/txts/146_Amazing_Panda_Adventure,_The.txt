CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
WARNER BROS.
THE GIANT PANDA IS THE MOST
FAMOUS ANIMAL IN THE WORLD.
SHE IS THE INTERNATIONAL
SYMBOL FOR PEACE,
ONLY THERE IS NO PEACE
IN HER LIFE.
THE PANDAS LIVE
IN THE FORESTS OF CHINA,
AND BECAUSE THE FORESTS
ARE DISAPPEARING,
SO IS THE PANDA.
TODAY, THERE ARE FEWER
THAN 1,000 PANDAS
LEFT IN THE WORLD,
BUT THE BIGGEST THREAT
TO THEIR EXTINCTION
IS THAT PEOPLE
JUST DON'T CARE.
AND THAT'S WHAT MY DAD
DOES FOR A LIVING.
HE'S IN CHINA,
FIGHTING OFF THE LIONS
AND THE TIGERS
AND THE POACHERS
TO SAVE THE PANDAS,
JUST LIKE INDIANA JONES,
AND THAT'S WHY
HE'S NOT HERE,
BECAUSE SAVING PANDAS
ARE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT.
THANK YOU, RYAN.
THAT WAS VERY NICE.
AND NOW WE'LL HEAR
FROM JOHNNY'S FATHER,
WHO'LL SPEAK
ABOUT HIS CHOSEN PROFESSION,
THE NIGHT SHIFT AT
7-ELEVEN.
THE BEST PART
ABOUT DAD'S JOB
IS WHEN
HE BRINGS HOME
TWINKIES AND STUFF
WHEN THEY'RE PAST
THE EXPIRATION DATE.
AREN'T YOU WORRIED
THEY'RE SPOILED?
DAD SAYS THEY HAVE
ENOUGH CHEMICALS
TO CHOKE A MOOSE.
WHY DO YOU EAT IT?
IT TASTES GOOD.
WHAT DO PANDAS EAT?
BAMBOO.
THAT'S LIKE EATING
A TREE.
HOW DO THEY
GET SO FAT?
I DON'T KNOW.
ASK YOUR MOM IF I
CAN STAY FOR DINNER.
YOU STAY EVERY NIGHT.
I DON'T WANT HER
THINKING I'M A MOOCH.
O.K.
I HOPE SHE'S MAKING
MASHED POTATOES
AND GRAVY.
WHAT'S THAT?
THE SYMBOL OF THE RESERVE
WHERE MY DAD WORKS.
[RADIO PLAYS]
HI, SWEETHEART.
HI, MOM.
HEY, JOHNNY.
HI, MS. TYLER.
WHAT'S HE HAVE TO SAY?
I DON'T KNOW YET.
GOING SOMEWHERE?
YEAH. CHINA.
SERIOUS?
OVER SPRING RECESS.
THAT'S COOL.
YOU AND OLD POP SAVING
THE PANDA BEAR TOGETHER.
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL
ME YOU WERE GOING?
I DON'T KNOW.
I GUESS I FORGOT.
HOW LONG HAS HE
BEEN THERE?
SINCE THEY'VE BEEN
DIVORCED--ABOUT TWO YEARS.
[BEEP BEEP]

AMERICAN GLADIATORS.
AMERICAN GLADIATORS.
GOODBYE, NEPTUNE.
GOODBYE, GEMINI.
GOODBYE, ORION.
GOOD HUNTING.
GOODBYE, BIG DIPPER.
DON'T SPILL ANYTHING
WHEN I'M GONE.
GOODBYE, URSA MINOR,
YOU LITTLE BEAR, YOU.
I'VE SEWN NAMETAGS
ON ALL YOUR UNDERWEAR.
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.
WAIT. IF IT'S
NOT CHINESE,
WHAT GOOD IS IT?
WHY DIDN'T I THINK
OF THAT?
MOM, LISTEN.
AND DON'T EAT ANYTHING
WITH EYEBALLS IN IT.
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO LIKE IT.
AND REMEMBER THAT DADDY'S
GOING TO BE AT THE GATE.
IF ANYTHING
DOES GO WRONG--
NEXT.
JUST TELL
THEM YOU'RE
AN AMERICAN.
NEXT.
WINDOW OR AISLE?
UM...UH...WINDOW.
MOM...MOM...
CAN I TALK TO YOU?
WHAT IS IT, HONEY?
I DON'T WANT TO GO.
WHAT?
I DON'T WANT TO GO.
I NEVER DID.
OH, HONEY.
WELL, WHY DID YOU
WAIT UNTIL NOW
TO TELL ME?
WE'LL BE BACK.
LOOK, I KNOW
IT'S FRIGHTENING
GOING TO
A STRANGE COUNTRY.
I'M NOT
A LITTLE KID.
I'M NOT SCARED.
THEN WHAT IS IT?
DON'T YOU WANT
TO SEE YOUR FATHER?
I DON'T THINK HE
WANTS TO SEE ME.
OH, HONEY.
HEY, YOU KNOW HOW
YOU AND JOHNNY GET
WHEN YOU PLAY NINTENDO?
YOU GET SO INTO IT
THAT HOURS GO BY
AND I HAVE TO SCREAM
TO GET YOU TO NOTICE ME.
THAT'S KIND OF HOW
YOUR DAD IS ABOUT HIS WORK.
HIS WORK'S
MORE IMPORTANT
TO HIM THAN ME?
NO, BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT HE DOESN'T LOVE YOU.
FLIGHT 430 TO HONG KONG
NOW BOARDING AT GATE 28.
THAT'S YOUR PLANE.
RYAN...
PLANES WORK BOTH WAYS.
IF YOU REALLY DON'T
LIKE IT OVER THERE,
YOU CAN ALWAYS COME HOME.
PROMISE?
PROMISE.
I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH.
I LOVE YOU, TOO.
[YIP]
[YIPPING]
[YELPING]
[GROWLING]
HEY, IT'S ALL RIGHT,
GIRL.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
WE WON'T HURT YOU.
TRANQUILIZE HER
BEFORE SHE HURTS
HERSELF.
[SPEAKING CHINESE]
EASY.
O.K., SHE'S DOWN.
LET'S GET THAT RADIO COLLAR
ON HER.
AHH.
SHE'S SO BEAUTIFUL.
SHE SURE IS.
ALL RIGHT, GIRL,
NOW, THIS WON'T HURT
A BIT.
YOU JUST RELAX.
THAT'S IT, THAT'S IT.
LET ME GET THIS ON.
UH-HUH.
THERE WE GO.
WE'RE PUTTING THIS ON YOU
SO WE CAN HELP YOU
IF YOU GET INTO
ANY TROUBLE. THERE.
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.
SHE'S NURSING.
THAT'S GREAT.
SHE MUST HAVE A CUB
HIDDEN SOMEWHERE.
THAT WOULD
BE WONDERFUL.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO KEEP AN EYE ON HER.
A CUB WOULD KEEP
THE RESERVE OPEN.
WE DON'T WANT TO BE
HERE WHEN SHE WAKES UP.
LET'S GO BACK
TO THE RESERVE,
MAKE SURE WE'RE
GETTING A CLEAR SIGNAL
FROM
THE TRACKING COLLAR.
[SPEAKING CHINESE]
[WHIMPERING]
UM, I'M LOOKING
FOR MY FATHER
MICHAEL TYLER.
MICHAEL TYLER.
TYLER.
I SAID TYLER,
NOT TOILET.
YES.
DAD!
IS THIS BUS GOING
TO THE PANDA RESERVE?
[GASPS]
[GROWLS]
[WHINING]
I THINK SOMETHING'S WRONG.
THE COLLAR ISN'T MOVING.
IF THE MOTHER BEAR
IS HURT,
HER CUB WILL BE IN DANGER.
WE NEED THAT CUB
TO KEEP THE RESERVE OPEN.
WE HAVE TO GO OUT NOW.
I'M NOT GOING
TO LOSE ANOTHER PANDA.
OH, NO.
THE COMMITTEE,
THEY ARE EARLY.
YOU'RE EARLY.
WE WEREN'T
EXPECTING YOU YET.
WE'RE NOT PREPARED.
YES, DR. TYLER,
WE WERE SENT
BY THE COMMITTEE
TO MAKE
A PRELIMINARY
REPORT
FOR MR. HSU
ON PROGRESS
OF RESERVE.
WE'RE NOT READY
FOR AN INSPECTION.
WE ONLY MAKE
PRELIMINARY REPORT.
MR. HSU
WILL BE HERE
AT THE END
OF THE WEEK.
THAT'S...
RYAN.
IT'S ME.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
YOU SENT ME
A TICKET.
I KNOW, BUT YOU'RE
NOT SUPPOSED TO ARRIVE
UNTIL THE 19th.
LING, WHAT'S TODAY?
19th.
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO MEET ME.
WELL, YOU MADE IT.
UH...
WELL...
YOU'RE HERE NOW, HUH?
BOY, YOU'VE GROWN.
DR. TYLER...
I'M SORRY
TO INTERRUPT,
BUT WE CANNOT
COME BACK.
THE COMMITTEE
MUST INSPECT NOW.
THIS RESERVE WAS SET UP
TO SAVE THE PANDA,
AND RIGHT NOW I'VE GOT
A PANDA SOMEWHERE OUT THERE
THAT MIGHT BE IN DANGER,
SO YOU'LL HAVE TO EXCUSE ME.
CHANG!
MR. CHANG WILL BE HAPPY
TO ANSWER ANY
OF YOUR QUESTIONS,
SO PLEASE EXCUSE ME.
DAD?
AW, RIGHT.
WHY DON'T YOU
GRAB YOUR STUFF,
AND WE'LL STOW IT
IN MY ROOM?
I'LL BE BACK
BEFORE NIGHTFALL.
THEN WE'LL HAVE A CHANCE
TO GET CAUGHT UP.
CAN'T I GO WITH YOU?
NO. TOO RUGGED
OUT THERE,
TOO DANGEROUS.
RYAN....
COMING?
COME ON IN.
THIS IS IT.
HERE.
MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME.
HEY...
NOW, UH...
I'M SORRY I WASN'T THERE
FOR YOU AT THE AIRPORT.
I MEAN...
SOMETIMES WE LOSE TRACK
OF TIME AROUND HERE.
I GOT TO GO.
YOU MUST BE TIRED.
HOW ABOUT A NAP?
I'LL BE BACK SOON,
AS SOON AS I CAN.
I PROMISE.
YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
NO WAY.
DAD! DAD!
DAD, WAIT UP!
DAD!
I DIDN'T
COME HERE
TO STAY
IN YOUR ROOM!
GET BACK
TO THE COMPOUND.
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS
IN THE FOREST.
YOU'RE TAKING THAT
FUNNY-LOOKING GIRL
WITH YOU?
SHE'S NO TOUGHER
THAN ME.
I DON'T HAVE THE TIME
OR THE PATIENCE FOR THIS.
GET BACK TO THE RESERVE.
I'LL BE BACK
AS SOON AS I CAN.
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID
TWO YEARS AGO!
HOW'S YOUR MOM?
SHE'S O.K.
I TAKE CARE OF HER.
[SPEAKING CHINESE]
IS SHE MAD?
PROBABLY.
YOU'RE RIDING
IN HER SEAT.
WHAT DOES SHE DO?
NAME'S LING.
WORKS AS MY TRANSLATOR.
OLD MAN'S NAME IS CHU.
HE'S HER GRANDDAD.
BEEN WORKING AROUND PANDAS
HIS WHOLE LIFE.
IF WE DON'T SAVE
THIS PANDA CUB,
THE BUDGET COMMITTEE
WILL CLOSE THE RESERVE.
WHERE ARE WE GOING?
WE PUT A RADIO COLLAR
ON A MOTHER PANDA
JUST AHEAD
IN THE FOOTHILLS.
WE'LL START LOOKING
FOR HER THERE.
HOW MUCH FURTHER
IS IT?
WE'RE ALMOST THERE.
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!
OH, NO!
LING! HOLD ON! CHU!
[MOO]
I'M COMING!
[YELLING IN CHINESE]
YOU ALL RIGHT?
YOU O.K.?
[PANDA ROARS]
WHAT?
GIVE ME THE BLOWGUN.
BE CAREFUL.
THEY COULD HURT YOU.
WHAT'S SHE TALKING ABOUT?
POACHERS.
HE SAYS
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.
I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
YOU STAY HERE.
[WHINING]
[SPEAKING CHINESE]
NO!
DON'T SHOOT!
OH!
DR. TYLER!
HEY, WAIT FOR ME!
UHH. UHH.
DR. TYLER.
WHAT HAPPENED?
ARE YOU ALRIGHT?
THERE WERE
TWO POACHERS.
LING, THEY TOOK
HER CUB.
HER FOOT'S
IN THE TRAP.
[LING]
I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
[CHU SPEAKING CHINESE]
I GO RADIO
THE HELICOPTER.
[WHINING]
WE'VE GOT TO GET HER
OUT OF THAT TRAP.
I WANT TO GET
THAT COLLAR OFF HER
SO SHE CAN
BREATHE EASIER.
LET'S GET HER
TO THE RESERVE.
[PANTING]
GET IN FRONT WITH CHANG.
[CHANG]
NO. TOO MUCH WEIGHT
ALREADY.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
IT'S TOO MUCH WEIGHT
FOR THE HELICOPTER.
THERE'S NO ROOM
FOR A BOY.
HE'LL TAKE MY PLACE.
I'LL DROP YOU
AND THE BEAR OFF,
THEN COME BACK.
ALL RIGHT.
RYAN, STAY RIGHT HERE.
DON'T BUDGE.
I WON'T.
CHANG WILL BE BACK
TO PICK YOU UP.
YOU WAIT RIGHT HERE.
[WHIMPERING]
[SPEAKING CHINESE]
WHAT'S HE DOING?
WHERE'S HE GOING?
WE MUST BRING THE CUB
BACK TO THE RESERVE.
YOU'RE NOT
LEAVING ME HERE.
THEN COME.
ARE YOU CRAZY? I'M
NOT RISKING MY LIFE
FOR SOME STUPID
PANDA BEAR.
FINE. STAY HERE
AND MAKE YOURSELF HAPPY.
FINE. GO.
I EARNED MERIT BADGES
FROM THE CUB SCOUTS.
I CAN HANDLE THE WILD.
[BIRD SCREECHES]
I THINK.
LING?
[ANIMAL GRUNTING]
OH, LING.
HE--HE SAID
TO STAY HERE.
IT WAS
PERFECTLY SAFE.
[HISSES]
SNAKE!
CHU!
WHERE ARE YOU?
LING!
LING!
CHU!
LING!
HEY, YOU!
[SPEAKING CHINESE]
WHAT DID HE SAY?
SHUT UP.
THOSE ARE POACHERS.
MAYBE WE SHOULD WAIT
FOR THE HELICOPTER
TO COME BACK!
BY THEN,
IT MAY BE TOO LATE.
ARE YOU COMING OR NOT?
LOOK AT THIS.
IT'S ANCIENT.
COME ON.
JUST DON'T LOOK DOWN.
IT'S A LITTLE LATE FOR THAT.
COME ON!
[YELLING
IN CHINESE]
SORRY, BUT THERE'S NO WAY
I'M CROSSING THIS BRIDGE.
LOOK OUT!
[ROARS]
AAH!
HA HA HA HA HA...
[SPEAKING CHINESE]
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?
GRANDFATHER THINKS
RUNNING BOY IS VERY FUNNY.
GLAD HE'S HAVING FUN.
WHERE ARE THEY?
I'M SO SORRY.
I CAN'T FIND THEM.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU CAN'T FIND THEM?
I WENT TO THE SPOT,
CIRCLED MANY TIMES,
BUT I CAN'T FIND THEM.
THEY'VE GOT TO
BE THERE.
IS THERE,
LIKE, RADAR
IN HIS FINGER?
GRANDFATHER IS VERY WISE.
[SPEAKING CHINESE]
WHAT?
THIS IS
THE POACHER'S HOME.
LOOKS LIKE
NO ONE'S THERE.
LET'S GO.
[COUGHING]
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
THEY WERE GONE.
MUST BE BACK AGAIN.
[SPEAKING CHINESE]
HE'S LEAVING US?
HE NEEDS TO WATCH
FOR THE OTHER POACHER.
IF HE SEES ANYTHING,
HE WILL WHISTLE
TO WARN US.
LET'S JUST GET CLOSER.
[SHOUT]
WHAT IF HE'S GOING
TO GET HIS PARTNER?
WHAT IS THAT?
LING,
HE'S GOT A GUN...
WITH REAL BULLETS.
[SHOUT]
ARE YOU
GOING TO HIT HIM
WITH A SPIT WAD?
YOU'RE NOT LIKE
YOUR FATHER AT ALL.
DR. TYLER IS BRAVE.
[SHOUT]
I CAN'T GET HIM
FROM HERE.
HE HAS TO TURN AROUND.
UH...
[SHOUT]
OH, NO.
THIS BOY IS CRAZY.
HEY, YOU STUPID
POACHER!
OVER HERE, DUCK BRAIN!
[GUN COCKS]
UH...
AAH!
OH! AI-YO...
LOOKS LIKE WE GOT
THE WRONG CAVE.
LOOK AT ALL THESE HIDES.
WHY DO THEY WANT THESE?
TO SELL.
THINK ONE OF THESE
IS THE CUB?
NO. THEY WANT TO SELL
THE CUB TO A ZOO.
[WHINING]
HERE, I'LL GET IT.
HURRY. WHAT IF HIS
FRIEND COMES BACK?
SO THAT'S WHAT
ALL THE FUSS
IS ABOUT.
[SPEAKING CHINESE]
GRANDFATHER SAYS
HE NEEDS HIS MOTHER'S
MILK RIGHT AWAY.
WE MUST GET BACK
TO HER QUICKLY.
IT'S A CHOPPER.
WE'VE GOT TO GET
IN THE OPEN.
WE'RE DOWN HERE!
DOWN HERE!
LOOK DOWN!
WE'RE DOWN HERE!
HEY, WE'RE DOWN HERE!
OVER HERE!
NO! DOWN HERE!
WE'LL FIND THE EQUIPMENT.
MAYBE THEY WENT BACK THERE.
HAI!
[SPEAKING CHINESE]
PICKING ANYTHING UP?
NO.
CANNOT RECEIVE
THE SIGNAL.
DAMN IT.
OH...NOT THIS AGAIN.
[SPEAKING CHINESE]
DON'T LOOK DOWN.
DON'T LOOK DOWN.
IT ISN'T SO BAD.
[SHOUTING
IN CHINESE]
AAH!
AAH!
OH! HELP ME!
LING!
RYAN!
LING, HANG ON!
FROM OVER THERE.
HOLD ON.
I'M COMING.
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO SWIM.
COME ON!
RYAN, HELP.
GRAB MY HAND!
HELP ME, RYAN.
I CAN'T SWIM.
I WON'T LET YOU GO.
AAH!
DON'T LET ME GO,
RYAN!
HELP!
ALL RIGHT,
GRAB MY HAND!
RYAN, HELP...
I'VE GOT YOU.
DON'T LET GO.
AAH! HELP!
AAH!
AAH!
LING!
UH...UH...
CHU, WHAT'S HAPPENED?
WHERE ARE THE KIDS?
THE RIVER?
RYAN, HELP!
RYAN, HELP!
HE-E-E-ELP!
RYAN!
AAH!
RYAN!
RYAN!
RYAN!
DID YOU
HEAR THAT?
I THOUGHT I HEARD
LING'S VOICE.
[SPEAKING CHINESE]
TELL HIM
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT HE'S SAYING.
HE DOES NOT THINK
THE CHILDREN
SURVIVED THE FALL.
RYAN!
LING!
RYAN!
UH...
UH...
UH...
[LING]
RYAN!
RYAN!
RYAN, ARE YOU
ALL RIGHT?
YEAH.
YOU--
YOU LET ME GO.
I SAID
I COULDN'T SWIM.
I ALMOST DROWNED.
ALL LEFT
IS THIS CANDY BAR.
SPLIT IT?
WE HAVE TO SAVE IT
FOR EMERGENCY.
THIS IS AN EMERGENCY.
[WHINING]
THE CUB IS
HUNGRY, TOO.
WELL, I GOT DIBS.
CUB DOESN'T EAT CANDY.
SO HOW WE
GOING TO GET BACK?
[GASP]
WHAT IS THAT?
IT'S A RADIO COLLAR
TO TRACK PANDA.
IF WE TURN IT ON,
THEY CAN FIND US.
YES.
THE BATTERY IS LOOSE.
HERE, LET ME TRY IT.
NO. I GOT IT.
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO WITH IT.
RELAX.
I'M AN AMERICAN.
MY LIFE REVOLVES
AROUND ELECTRONICS.
I THINK
I CAN HANDLE IT.
[SPROING]
OOPS.
YOU ARE A MORMON.
MORMON?
I THINK YOU MEAN
MORON.
NEVER MIND.
I'M NOT TALKING
TO YOU.
NOW THEY CAN'T
FIND US.
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
THEY'RE LOOKING?
OF COURSE
THEY'RE LOOKING.
OTHERWISE
MY GRANDFATHER
WILL GET UPSET.
YOU THINK
GRANDFATHER
WILL ABANDON ME?
YOU THINK
DR. TYLER
WILL ABANDON YOU?
WOULDN'T BE
THE FIRST TIME.
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?
YOUR FATHER
A GOOD MAN,
GOOD FRIEND
TO PEOPLE HERE,
GOOD FRIEND
TO PANDA.
RIGHT.
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN
TOO BUSY BEING
EVERYONE'S FRIEND,
BUT NEVER MINE.
LET'S JUST GET
OUT OF HERE, O.K.?
WHERE ARE WE?
HOW DO WE GET BACK?
I DON'T KNOW.
I THINK
WE ARE LOST.
LOST?
I THOUGHT YOU KNEW
WHERE WE WERE GOING.
THE RIVER TOOK US
SO FAR DOWNSTREAM
THAT I'M
ALL TURNED AROUND.
OH, GREAT.
IF I CAN FIND
THE FOUR SISTERS
MOUNTAIN,
I CAN GET US BACK
TO THE RESERVE.
[SPEAKING CHINESE]
IS HE PICKING UP
A SIGNAL?
NO. NO SIGNAL.
LING HAD
THE RADIO COLLAR
WITH HER.
SHE TOOK IT
OFF OF CHIH.
[SPEAKING CHINESE]
THERE IS NOTHING
WE CAN DO.
WE SHOULD GO BACK
TO THE TRACKING ROOM
AND TRY TO
PICK UP THE SIGNAL.
[WHINING]
SOUNDS LIKE HE'S CRYING.
ACCORDING TO
MY GRANDFATHER,
PANDA BEARS DO CRY.
LONG TIME AGO,
PANDA BEAR
WAS ALL WHITE.
WHITE PANDA
HAD A FRIEND--
A YOUNG GIRL.
SHE'S THE YOUNGEST
OF THE FOUR SISTERS.
PANDA HELPED HER
AS SHE HERDED
HER FATHER'S SHEEP.
ONE DAY A HUNGRY
TIGER COMES,
AND HE WANTS
TO EAT PANDA.
THE GIRL TRIED TO
STOP THE ATTACK,
BUT THE TIGER
KILLED THE GIRL.
TO HONOR THE GIRL,
PANDAS
RUB BLACK ASHES
ON THEIR ARMS.
IT'S A SIGN
OF MOURNING.
ALL THE PANDAS
WERE SO SAD.
BLACK ASHES GET ON
THEIR WHITE FUR
AND INTO THEIR EYES
BECAUSE THEY CRIED
SO MUCH.
WHEN THEY OPENED
THEIR EYES AGAIN,
THE THREE SISTERS
WERE GONE.
THEY BAILED?
BECAUSE THEY MISSED
THEIR SISTER
SO MUCH,
THEY JUMP
INTO THE RIVER.
THE NEXT DAY...
A MOUNTAIN RAISED UP
WITH FOUR PEAKS.
I BET THAT'S
THE FOUR SISTERS.
YES.
THEY STAND GUARD
OVER PANDAS,
WATCH AFTER THEM,
PROTECT THEM
FOREVER.
SO THE PANDAS
NEVER FORGOT
THE GIRL WHO CARED
ABOUT THEM SO MUCH,
AND THAT THEY REMAIN
AS THEY WERE--
BLACK AND WHITE.
THAT'S A BUNCH OF BULL.
IT'S NOT
ABOUT A BULL.
IT'S ABOUT PANDA.
NO. WHAT I MEAN IS,
IT'S NOT TRUE.
MY GRANDFATHER
DOESN'T LIE.
THEN IF THESE
FOUR SISTERS ARE REAL,
HOW COME THE PANDA BEARS
ARE GOING EXTINCT?
HEY, GIRL.
SHE WON'T EAT.
THAT'S NO GOOD, CHIH.
YOU GOT TO BE STRONG
FOR YOUR CUB...
FOR WHEN HE COMES BACK.
LOOK, LITTLE BEAR,
THE PROBLEM IS,
IF I TAKE YOU BACK,
THE RESERVE WILL STAY OPEN,
AND I WON'T SEE MY DAD
FOR ANOTHER TWO YEARS.
BEARS BELONG
IN THE WOODS ANYWAY
WHERE THEY CAN RUN AND PLAY
AND EAT BAMBOO
WITH ALL THE OTHER BEARS.
YOU'RE BETTER OFF
HERE IN THE WILD.
I'M DOING YOU A FAVOR.
HERE'S SOME BAMBOO.
PANDAS EAT THIS STUFF.
YOU'LL LOVE IT.
YOU CAN'T FOLLOW ME.
YOU HAVE TO STAY HERE.
GO OUT AND MAKE
SOME FRIENDS.
AND DON'T WORRY.
YOU'LL BE O.K.
[WHINING]
[YIP]
GOD, IF YOU WEREN'T
SO LITTLE AND CUTE,
THIS WOULDN'T
BE SO HARD.
SEE YOU LATER,
LITTLE BEAR.
GOOD LUCK.
I CAN'T DO THIS.
HEY, CUTIE.
COME ON.
COME ON,
LET'S GO HOME, O.K.?
COME ON.
COME ON...
COME ON.
COME ON.
COME ON.
COME ON.
COME ON, COME ON.
COME OVER HERE.
COME ON, LITTLE ONE.
I THINK HE LIKES YOU.
YEAH.
LOOK. WE CAN CROSS
THE RIVER RIGHT HERE.
WHY DO YOU STILL HAVE
THAT RADIO COLLAR?
AH...IT MIGHT
WIND UP BEING
MY ONLY SOUVENIR
FROM THIS TRIP.
IT'S GETTING
KIND OF SLIPPERY.
UH...
WHOA...
AAH!
OH, NO!
NOT AGAIN!
AAH! AAH! AAH!
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!
HA HA HA...
HA HA. VERY FUNNY.
YOU THINK I'M FUNNY,
YOU SHOULD LOOK
AT YOUR FACE.
THERE'S STUFF
ALL OVER IT.
THERE'S STUFF
ON YOUR FACE, TOO.
HA HA HA...
AAH! LEECHES!
LEECHES?
AAH!
AAH!
OH! HELP!
[LING]
DON'T YOU DARE
COME OVER HERE.
STAY ON YOUR SIDE.
[RYAN]
I'M NOT COMING
OVER THERE.
YOU THINK
I'D WANT TO
SEE YOU NAKED?
IT'S NOT PROPER.
I'VE SEEN PLENTY
OF NAKED WOMEN BEFORE.
A--I HAVE CABLE TV.
B--I HAPPEN TO BE
QUITE A LADIES' MAN.
LADY MAN?
WELL--WELL, YES.
LADY...MAN.
HALF LADY, HALF MAN?
NO. THAT'S NOT
WHAT I MEAN.
WELL, YOU SEE,
I'M--
AW, FORGET IT.
JUST KNOW THAT
ME SEEING YOU
IN THE BUFF
WOULD NOT EXACTLY
BE THE THRILL
OF MY LIFE.
THE CLOTHES
NEED TO BE WASHED.
YOU GET THE CLOTHES.
FAT CHANCE.
IF YOU
GET THE CLOTHES,
YOU CAN HAVE
THE CANDY BAR.
IT'S PROBABLY FULL
OF SLIME ANYWAY.
FINE. THEN I'LL
JUST WAIT HERE.
GOOD, 'CAUSE I CAN
WAIT HERE, TOO.
[SHIVERING]
LING, IT'S GETTING
KIND OF COLD.
I'M NOT COLD.
[SHIVERING]
LING,
YOU'RE SHIVERING.
I CAN SEE IT
FROM HERE.
WHY DO YOU DO THAT?
DO WHAT?
ACT SO TOUGH.
I AM TOUGH.
MAYBE, BUT...
YOU SHOULD HAVE
A LITTLE FUN
NOW AND THEN.
I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR FUN.
I'M BUSY WORKING
WITH PANDAS.
BUT YOU'RE JUST A KID.
DON'T YOU EVER GO
TO THE MALL
AND PLAY VIDEO GAMES
AND STUFF?
THE MALL?
STORES
ALL PACKED TOGETHER.
AND THIS IS FUN?
YEAH.
I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR FRIENDS.
I MUST EARN MONEY
FOR MY FAMILY.
WHY?
WHERE'S YOUR FATHER?
FATHER DIED.
I'M SORRY.
YOU ARE LUCKY...
TO HAVE A FATHER.
[BEEPING]
AMERICAN GLADIATORS.
MY WATCH...
THE BATTERY!
BE CAREFUL.
[BEEPING]
GOT IT.
IT WORKS.
MICHAEL!
MICHAEL.
COME ON.
WAKE UP.
[BEEPING]
LOOK.
THE TRACKING COLLAR.
THE SIGNAL'S WEAK.
THEY'RE ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE MOUNTAIN.
RYAN.
QUIT WIGGLING.
[RYAN]
WHAT'S THAT?
OH, IT'S
A TIBETAN SHRINE.
WE MUST BE CLOSE
TO A VILLAGE.
[LING]
STOP!
RYAN,
CATCH HIM!
THERE HE IS!
COME ON!
[RYAN]
COME BACK HERE!
RYAN, CATCH HIM!
[RYAN]
I'M TRYING.
[RYAN]
I SEE HIM!
THERE HE IS!
[RYAN]
STOP!
[SPEAKING CHINESE]
LING.
[SPEAKING CHINESE]
I THINK HE'S MAD.
[YELPING]
[MAN]
AH.
[BAA]
[BAA]
[SPEAKING CHINESE]
[BAAING]
[CHEERING]
UHH.
[SPEAKING CHINESE]
IT'S O.K.
HE WON'T HURT HIM.
[SPEAKING CHINESE]
[LING]
HE SAYS THE PANDA
IS GOOD LUCK
FOR THE VILLAGE.
[LING]
AND THEY WANT TO
HAVE A CELEBRATION.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
[MUSIC PLAYING]
[SINGING IN CHINESE]
[MOO]
[WHINNYING]
[RYAN]
WHAT IS THAT?
[LING]
RICE WINE.
HE SAYS WHOEVER
PROTECTS THE PANDA
IS A FRIEND
OF THE VILLAGE.
UHH.
HA HA HA.
[LAUGHING]
[SPEAKING CHINESE]
WHAT IS THIS STUFF?
BRAINS FROM MONKEY.
UHH.
UHH.
AND THIS?
STEAMED FUNGUS
IN FRESH YAK MILK.
FUNGUS?
AS IN ATHLETE'S FOOT?
[CHUCKLES]
PLEASE SAY
THIS ONE'S CHOCOLATE.
PLEASE,
PLEASE, PLEASE.
PLEASE.
UM, I'M SORRY.
THOSE ARE SLUGS.
HEY! HEY!
AAH!
AI-YAH.
AHH.
HE WON'T EAT.
MAYBE THERE'S
SO MANY PEOPLE
AROUND
MAKING
HIM NERVOUS.
PANDAS DON'T
EAT CAKE.
[RYAN]
WHAT ARE
WE GOING TO DO?
HE'S GETTING WEAK.
[SPEAKING CHINESE]
WE WILL SLEEP
HERE TONIGHT.
TOMORROW
HE WILL HELP US,
AND THEN
WE CAN GET THE CUB
BACK TO THE RESERVE.
[SIGHS]
[SPEAKING CHINESE]
TOMORROW
MAY BE TOO LATE.
I THINK
I GOT AN IDEA.
[MOANS]
UHH.
WELL...
IT'S YAK'S MILK,
BUT...
IT MIGHT WORK.
IT WAS A GOOD IDEA.
HEY.
WE'VE GOT TO COME UP
WITH A NAME FOR YOU.
IT'S AN OLD CUSTOM
IN CHINA...
WHEN A BABY'S BORN,
HIS FAMILY BRING HIM
UNDER THE STARS,
AND THEY GIVE HIM A NAME
SO THAT WAY
EVIL SPIRITS WILL KNOW
HE'S FROM THE HEAVEN.
WHAT NAME DO YOU LIKE?
I'VE GOT
A FRIEND AT HOME.
HIS NAME IS JOHNNY.
SORT OF SHORT AND FAT.
WE COULD CALL HIM
JOHNNY.
JOHNNY.
IN CHINESE,
IT MEANS THE BEST
IN THE FOREST.
WELL, I DOUBT
MY FRIEND JOHNNY'S
THE BEST IN THE FOREST.
THE BEST
IN THE LUNCH ROOM'S
MORE LIKE IT.
I LIKE THIS NAME.
WHEN YOU GO TOMORROW,
I BET A LOT OF GIRLS
WANT TO GO WITH YOU.
NO.
I LIED.
I'M NOT REALLY
A LADIES' MAN.
OH.
MAYBE SOMEDAY
I VISIT AMERICA,
AND, UH, YOU TAKING
ME GO SEE MALL?
I KNOW EVERY
CONSTELLATION UP THERE.
MY DAD PAINTED IT ALL
ON MY BEDROOM CEILING.
HE SAID
IF I EVER GET LONELY,
I COULD LOOK UP
AT THE STARS,
AND NO MATTER
WHERE HE WAS,
WE COULD BE LOOKING UP
AT THE SAME THING,
AND THAT WAY
WE'D NEVER BE APART.

WE CAN'T GIVE UP NOW.
WE DON'T HAVE
MUCH FURTHER.
IT'S NO USE.
HE CAN'T EVEN
HOLD HIS HEAD UP.
[MOANING]
WE WILL
NEVER MAKE IT.
LISTEN UP, LING.
REMEMBER THE BRIDGE.
REMEMBER WHEN
I WOULDN'T LET YOU GO.
JOHNNY'S NOT
GOING TO DIE,
I'M NOT GOING
TO LET HIM.
I PROMISE.
[RYAN]

FOUR SISTERS,
DON'T LET ME FALL.
I'M ON YOUR SIDE.

WE CAN'T GET DOWN
THIS WAY.
NOW WHAT DO WE DO?
WE MUST GO BACK.
BUT THERE'S NO TIME.
WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.
WE HAVE TO GO BACK
