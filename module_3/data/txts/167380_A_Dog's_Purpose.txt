<i>What is the meaning of life?</i>
<i>Are we here for a reason?</i>
<i>Is there a point to any of this?</i>
<i>First, I had no idea what was going on.</i>
<i>I... I couldn't see a thing.</i>
<i>It was warm.</i>
<i>There was my mother.</i>
<i>Every day, I had fun.</i>
<i>Was having fun the point?</i>
<i>The whole point?</i>
<i>No, it couldn't be that simple.</i>
Here's one.
<i>And then it was over.</i>
That's it for you.
<i>No more fun.</i>
<i>It seemed like such a short life.</i>
<i>I mean, what exactly did I do?</i>
<i>There was some playing.</i>
<i>There was some eating.</i>
<i>I dug in the dirt.</i>
<i>But when I really thought about it,</i>
<i>it didn't add up to much.</i>
<i>I was back.</i>
<i>And I was a puppy again.</i>
<i>Alive and ready to ask the big questions.</i>
<i>To dig for answers.</i>
<i>Just let me in there.</i>
<i>Um, where am I?</i>
So what else do you have?
- Uh, this one here.
- Oh.
- What is it?
- It's a red retriever.
Oh. Oh, yeah.
- Oh!
- Nice dog.
Good breed. Easy to train.
You got something smaller?
I got some cute Yorkies over here.
- Oh.
- I got this Japanese Chin.
- Ah!
- Uh, poodle.
Corgi over here.
Got a Pomeranian.
<i>Look at all this great stuff.</i>
<i>Somebody knew I was coming.</i>
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>
Hey, look at this.
What do we have here?
Look at this little guy.
Bet it's worth a couple bucks.
Yeah, it was a knockout
in the second round.
I lost everything. Hang tight, guy.
Now, you're buying this time.
Not today, buddy.
I thought about my life.
<i>I still had so many questions.</i>
<i>But I kept coming back to the same one...</i>
<i>How do I get a drink of water?</i>
Do you want to get an ice cream?
Sure.
What flavor?
Mom, I hear something in there.
Hey, honey.
Ethan!
Hey, Mom, come here.
My God.
It looks so thirsty.
It's too hot in there.
I think we need to get him out.
I can't open the door.
Wait, it's locked.
Please, Mom.
Okay, stand back.
You poor thing.
You poor, poor thing.
How are you, boy?
- Good?
- <i>What... what is this?</i>
- Mom!
- <i>A boy?</i>
- Boy...
- <i>A boy!</i>
- Are you okay?
- <i>I-I never knew there might be</i>
- <i>such a thing as a boy.</i>
- Tired, huh?
I think this little guy
is gonna make it.
- Can we keep him, Mom?
- I don't know.
I think your father might not...
<i>I decided right then and there</i>
<i>I am definitely keeping this boy.</i>
Yeah! Dad, can we keep him?
Well, who's gonna feed him?
- I will.
- Who's gonna clean him?
I'll do everything, Dad.
- You think you're ready to do it?
- Yeah.
- Oh, I don't know, son.
- He's a good boy.
He's a good boy.
Come on, please.
He's a retriever, Dad.
He'll fetch your slippers.
And the paper when it rains.
Name something you want fetched.
He can do it.
Look. Hey, come here!
What are you doing?
So, Ethan and I discussed that the dog
- would be his responsibility.
- Come here! Yeah. Good boy.
Please, Dad?
Come on. He needs a pal.
All right, this thing
that you two are doing,
it's dirty pool...
...okay? Take him away.
I want to talk to your mother alone.
Okay.
We'll keep it till tomorrow...
You nervous, boy? Don't be.
It'll be okay. Yeah.
We don't have much choice.
They make a mess.
- You gotta clean 'em.
- Oh, come on.
- He's gonna be bored with it.
- Oh, come on, Jim.
You know it. You know how he is.
If he says no, we can run off
and go find another family.
Ethan?
Yeah?
You have a dog.
Yes! Oh, my gosh, yes!
Come on, boy. Dad!
- Whoo! Yes!
- All right.
Oh, my gosh, thank you!
Come on! Come on!
Bailey.
B-A-I-L-E-Y, I-I would think.
And I'm Ethan.
I'm the owner.
Do you think he knows
how to spell my name?
I would think so, honey.
Here you go.
Good boy.
Here you go.
Ready?
Come on, Bailey.
Bailey, sit.
Sit.
Roll over. Roll over.
Get that out of your mouth!
Get that out of your mouth.
Okay. Come here.
Shake your paw. Shake your paw.
Come on. Yeah, good boy!
Turn around. Turn around.
- Come on.
- <i>What's he saying?</i>
- <i>It's too many words.</i>
- Come on. Okay.
- <i>I'm gonna do this now.</i>
- Come here.
Good job. Good job.
<i>But one word got said more than any other.</i>
<i>Bailey, Bailey, Bailey, Bailey, Bailey.</i>
<i>After a while,</i>
<i>I came to understand
the words that mattered.</i>
<i>I had a boy, and his name was Ethan.</i>
<i>I got a name.</i>
<i>My name was Bailey, Bailey,
Bailey, Bailey, Bailey.</i>
<i>Oh, gee, honey, I wish I'd have
known that you and Wes were...</i>
<i>I learned my place in the pack.</i>
<i>Mom liked me.</i>
- Yes...
- <i>Dad liked me.</i>
- Yes. Yes, no, I understand.
- <i>A lot.</i>
Oh, excuse me. Hold on. Come on.
Get down a bit.
<i>I was sad for the cat.</i>
<i>Obviously, he wanted to be a dog.</i>
<i>Wasn't my fault he couldn't be a dog.</i>
Ethan, it's time to go to bed.
Time to turn out the light, okay?
Okay.
Okay, come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.
Okay.
"Don't! Don't do it, Cap.
"Let him have it, Bucky.
"We'll pound some sense
into this character.
"Pow! Stomp!
"It's coming right at us.
Jump for your lives!"
<i>Ethan always came up
with such great games.</i>
- "Boom!"
- <i>Making noise under a blanket, genius.</i>
- "Zap!"
- <i>Every night as I fell asleep,</i>
<i>I thought about how happy
I was that I had an Ethan.</i>
<i>And that I wasn't a cat.</i>
Bailey, get in the car.

- Yeah.
Enjoy your meal.
<i>I liked the old humans.</i>
<i>They got me.</i>
Would you please stop feeding the dog?
- Oh.
- We're trying to train him.
I told you.
You caught me. I'm sorry.
Could you pass me the jam, please?
<i>When I wasn't thinking
about food, my mind wandered.</i>
<i>Why am I here?</i>
<i>What's the purpose?</i>
<i>Oh, yeah. Keep rubbing.</i>
<i>And... might there be more bacon?</i>
Oh, look at his plate.
You know, the way you eat,
you're gonna grow up to be bigger
than all of us put together.
- Yes!
- Oh!
If there's a world to grow up in.
These Russians are putting
missiles in Cuba.
Do we have to talk about that now?
- No.
- So, um, Jim,
I hear you're up for a new office job.
Why don't you tell us about that?
That didn't work out.
Well, they want him in the field.
He's one of the top sellers every year.
I got the job nobody wants.
Jim, do you have to?
We're three seconds away
from nuclear annihilation.
Uh, can me and Bailey be excused?
Sure.
Ethan was sad.
I didn't know why.
Hey, Bailey.
Captain America, remember?
He could take out that bomb in a second.
Pow!
Zap!
Oh, you like it, don't you?
Whoa.
Come on. Come on.
Yeah, boy. Oh!
Okay, Bailey.
Get it, boy!
Whoo! Come on!
Yeah, boy! Come on.
Come on. Oh, where'd it go?
Where'd it go? Oh, oh!
Come on, boy! Oh! What is that?
Get it, boy!
Oh, come on. Come on, get it!
- <i>We played with that ball all afternoon.</i>
- Yeah! Come on!
- <i>Ethan loved it.</i>
- Good boy!
Get it!
Come on! Come on.
Hey, Dad, watch this.
Look what he can do.
Okay, Bailey. Ready?
Ready.
Stay. Okay.
And...
Okay.
Go, Bailey!
Yeah! Out.
That's great, pal.
Thanks, Dad.
Hey, hey, come on.
Oh, yes. Yes.
Come on. Come on.
- You have a great day.
- <i>When it got colder outside,</i>
- <i>we all went back home.</i>
- See ya.
- He'll be fine. Bye.
- Bye.
<i>Every morning,
a big yellow box with wheels</i>
<i>took Ethan away from me.</i>
<i>When Mom left the house, too,</i>
<i>I was lonely.</i>
<i>And hungry.</i>
<i>And bored.</i>
<i>At least they left the cat.</i>
<i>I'd give him his dog lessons.</i>
<i>Ugh. So much to learn.</i>
<i>No, dogs do not hide under pillows.</i>
<i>Come on. Come...</i>
<i>Hey, hey.</i>
<i>Come on, sniff me.</i>
<i>Sniff me!</i>
<i>Ugh! You don't know anything.</i>
<i>Wow. You clear your throat a lot.</i>
Oh, Bailey, no.
Hi, Dad.
Elizabeth?
- This... this...
- Elizabeth!
Hello?
Hey!
That's my slipper.
Bailey! Bailey!
Come... Get back here.
Bailey, no!
Bailey, come here.
Come here. Come here.
Bailey, come here.
- Give me that.
- <i>When Dad was in</i>
<i>the right mood, he was
so much fun to play with.</i>
Come on, let go. Let go. Let go.
That's not yours, Bailey.
That's mine. That's mine!
You come over here. Come on!
Ethan, my boss is coming over tonight,
and he cannot see my office like this.
Do you understand?
You have got to start
telling this dog who's boss.
Here, take him. Just take him.
And you say, "I am the boss!"
You gotta show him who's boss.
All right, everything goes
back where it belongs.
I want this place spick-and-span.
Do you understand?
Well, do you understand?
Do you understand?!
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.
I want everything
just the way I like it.
Spick-and-span.
Why? Because I'm the boss. That's why.
I'm the boss man, and you're the boss dog.
Boss dog.
Boss dog.
Boss dog.
Boss dog.
Ethan.
Come on. Let's go.
We got guests coming any minute.
Chop-chop.
Jim?
- What?
- Jim, can you help me?
Huh?
I don't know how to
make a Singapore Sling.
What?
Oh, I'll show you.
I can make a whiskey cobbler.
Wait, here's the recipe.
Elizabeth, what are you...
what are you doing?
Well, we need spirit...
Saint-Gaudens 1907 golden eagle.
Real gold.
No! Hey!
<i>Ethan was good to me.</i>
- Boy! No!
- <i>He always shared his food.</i>
Do you have it in your mouth?
Did you swallow it?
- <i>Wasn't my favorite treat.</i>
- Come on, show me.
- <i>And he wanted it back.</i>
- Come on, come on.
Why?
- We made it.
- Hello! Ellen.
Come in. Welcome.
- Yes.
- I am glad we were finally able
to make it out here, because
I have been wanting
to, uh, visit the field
office for a while now.
Oh, yes, and it's... it's so nice and...
quiet out here in the suburbs.
- It sure is. Yeah.
- Yes.
Well, we're happy to have you.
Um, so I-I've been meaning to say we...
uh, we're real impressed
with your numbers this past year, Jim.
Real impressed.
You know, I'm glad you brought that up.
Uh, I've actually been meaning
to talk to you about that.
You know, I-I was thinking,
with the numbers so high,
maybe it's time I get off the road
and take an office position.
Well, we... we really
need you on the road.
That's the backbone
of the whole operation really.
I'll be honest, Jim.
You are one of our best
traveling salesmen.
I mean, I would be crazy
to take you out of the field.
Um, are you still collecting coins?
Oh, sure.
What... what's your showpiece?
1907 Saint-Gaudens golden eagle.
Oh! Well, Herman,
I don't know anything about coins,
but I know that that is special.
- That is special.
- That is a treasure.
Yeah, I have never seen
one up close before.
- It's quite a coin.
- Yeah, it's a beauty.
I'll show you. I'll go get it.
Well, maybe after dinner.
Let me go get it later.
May I please be excused?
Huh?
May I please be excused?
Need to take Bailey out for a walk.
Sure, honey.
Go on, do it.
Please, Bailey.
Please, Bailey, do it. Come on.
<i>What does he want from me?</i>
Come on. Come on.
<i>I really wish I knew what he was saying.</i>
Go! Go! Come on!
What's your problem? Come on!
<i>I don't know why he was so
upset, but it made me anxious.</i>
<i>And when I'm anxious, things
kind of move super fast.</i>
<i>This was a first.</i>
<i>I'd never seen him so happy
to clean up after me.</i>
Yes! Found it!
It's important it shouldn't be too sweet.
- No, it's nice. Mmm.
- See this?
- Oh.
- Now, this...
- Mm-hmm.
- ...that's something
- for your eyes to feast on.
- No!
What?
There's a rat.
- What?
- Right there!
- Where? No, I don't like rats.
- Where?
- Where is it?
- It's okay.
- Under the table.
- I love rats.
- Yeah, go get it, Bailey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- I don't see anything.
- Where?
- It's running over there.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait!
Get that dog! Get the dog.
- Get the dog. Get the...
- Bailey!
- I don't see anything.
- Come here.
- It's right there.
- Maybe you saw Smokey.
- Definitely not Smokey.
- No, it wasn't Smokey.
I really don't like rats.
I don't like rats.
It's more scared of you
than you are of him.
- Oh, oh!
- Come here. Come here, Bailey.
- Come here! Come here.
- Can you grab him? Grab him.
- Jim.
- Bailey! Bailey, come here!
Come here!
Wait. Please, Bailey.
- Can you grab him, Jim?
- I don't see anything.
Bailey!
Bailey, come here.
I think it's gone now.
Oh, I don't like rats!
Whoa!
Bailey!
What was that?
Herman!
Bailey, come here!
Come here! Come on!
You got him, Jim? You got him?
Whoa!
Any chances I had
of a promotion, forget it.
Dad! Dad, stop!
- It's not his fault. It's...
- You made us look like fools!
<i>Dad always talked so loud
when he smelled this way.</i>
Don't punish him! My fault!
Jim, why don't we
take a moment before you...
No, from now on, he stays out here.
He didn't do anything!
I do not want to see him.
I do not want to see him in the house.
But it's cold outside.
Well, he's got fur for that.
We should at least set out a blanket.
It's a dog!
Ethan?
Hey, boy. Good?
I'm so sorry.
It's all my fault.
<i>Even though I couldn't see him,</i>
<i>I knew Ethan was very sad that night.</i>
Hey, boy.
Hey.
It's cold out there, isn't it?
<i>I knew he needed me.</i>
<i>And I needed him, too.</i>
You're a good boy.
Ready, boy?
Okay. Come here.
Come here.
Come on, Bailey.
Okay, boy. Ready?
Three, two...
one!
Come on!
Yeah, boy.
Yeah, boy.
- Oh, come on.
- Let's do it again.
- Yes!
- Yeah!
Nice throw, Ethan. Nice throw.
Nice play.
Great pass, Ethan.
Got 'em now. Right on.
You-you get it to him every time.
Yeah, exactly.
'Cause every time we run that play...
<i>Everybody wanted to walk
next to the alpha male.</i>
Yeah, that's what I mean.
<i>Almost everybody.</i>
'Cause he's right
there every single time.
Yep.
Ethan, why do you always
have this dog with you?
Hmm?
What? It's like a girlfriend
replacement or something?
- Huh?
- Yeah, good one, Todd.
Give a little kiss? Huh?
I'm just asking.
Excuse me.
Oh, I'm sorry, Todd.
Did my, uh, girlfriend
replacement just trip you?
Very funny.
- Relax, man. I'm kidding.
- The dog's laughing at you.
- Dogs don't laugh, you moron.
- Bailey, come here.
<i>That's funny.</i>
- Got everything?
- Yeah.
When Lou dropped that pass at the start,
- I thought we were done, man.
- I know!
Here.
Bailey, come here.
Hey, Dad.
- You hungry?
- I'm starving.
- I got a casserole in the oven.
- Yeah?
<i>Africa is home to hundreds</i>
<i>of thousands of animals.</i>
<i>Some look comical, some...
some forbidding,</i>
<i>and some so entrancing that we'd like</i>
<i>to reach out and touch them...</i>
So, uh, coach made me
starting quarterback today.
That's great, kid.
You gotta come to my next game, Dad.
I'm serious. I'm better now.
It's been a long time.
Okay.
<i>Poor Dad.</i>
<i>Wow. Wow!</i>
<i>This place is great.</i>
<i>Oh, there's so much to smell here.</i>
<i>And eat.</i>
<i>Oh, it's everywhere.</i>
<i>Feed me. Feed me.</i>
- You want to go next?
- Mm-hmm.
<i>Ethan had a different smell
all of a sudden.</i>
<i>A sweaty smell.</i>
Who wants to go on that roller coaster?
<i>Hmm. I wonder if that girl
had anything to do with it.</i>
Oh! Hey, hey, hey!
Bailey, Bailey, Bailey, Bailey!
- Whoa!
- Sorry.
Sorry. Sorry.
That was the dog. That wasn't me.
- Oh.
- I wouldn't do that.
Okay, well, maybe
you should teach your dog some manners.
I've been trying.
He's, uh... he's not too smart.
Really?
Wow. Did you hear what he said about you?
You look pretty smart to me.
Oh, yeah.
Such intelligent eyes.
<i>My butt itches.</i>
What's your name, handsome?
He's, uh... he's Bailey.
- Bailey, yeah.
- Bailey.
Now, you seem like
a very good dog, Bailey.
- Yeah.
- Excuse me?
- Nice job.
- Oh. Thank you.
Nice.
Yeah... Oh!
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Keep that away from him.
- Okay, okay, okay.
- You're really good at that.
Thanks.
- Like, really good.
- Yeah?
I was watching you over there.
- Okay.
- Not like that.
I mean... Yeah.
See ya.
Hey, uh, if we never speak again,
I just want to take back
what I said before
about my dog not being smart.
He's actually really smart.
Definitely smarter than me.
<i>Now they both had a sweaty smell.</i>
You want to, uh... you want
to get a hot dog or something?
Popcorn?
Sure.
Okay, let's do it.
There's some good ones over here.
Hey, Bailey, come here.
<i>I wanted to save them,
but I didn't know how.</i>
- Come on.
- We done?
- Oh, that was good.
- Never again.
- No! It was fun!
- Thank you.
Thank you.
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
Uh-oh, Ethan's in trouble.
I'm gonna die.
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
- What's wrong with you?
- <i>Oh, don't worry, Ethan.</i>
- <i>I'll help.</i>
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, no, no, no, no.
Stay back. Stay back.
- Bailey, no, no, no.
- <i>But I'm helping.</i>
Bailey, stop! Bailey, Bailey,
Bailey, Bailey, Bailey,
Bailey, stop, stop, stop, stop. Hey. No.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
Thank you.
Thank you both for the ride.
Why did I eat so many meat logs?
Yeah, we should do something.
Yes, that would be nice.
It was fun.
It was.
Except for having to pay for 28 hot dogs.
Excuse me.
Whoa!
- Yeah, you better go. You better go quick.
- Okay.
- Okay. Bye.
- See ya.
<i>From that moment on,</i>
<i>the girl was a member of our pack.</i>
<i>I liked her.</i>
<i>Plus she smelled like biscuits.</i>
Go! Go, Bailey!
<i>We spent every day together.</i>
- That a boy.
- Ready, Bailey?
- Yeah. Go, go, go.
- Ready? Okay, here we go.
- Oh! Good boy!
- What a dive.
What was that?
- Oh! Good boy!
- Swim!
Bring it back!
That a boy.
- Come here, boy.
- That a boy. That a boy.
- Come on.
- Oh, good boy!
- Good boy. Good boy.
- Yeah, good boy.
- Oh! Whoa!
- Hey!
Watch your head.
Good boy.
- No, it's not okay.
- No.
Besides, I'm going.
- Why?
- You don't listen!
Every time I ask you where
something comes from...
You tell me! You tell me where it's going!
'Cause I earn it! I earn it! I earn it!
You, uh... you want to go to town instead?
Yeah.
- Bailey.
- Come on, Bailey!

You need to stop.
Oh, I'm sorry. You know, you're right.
Fine. I will stop doing it, then.
I'll just go! I'll just leave.
Does that sound good to you?
- Come on, boy.
- Does it sound good to you?
- Well, I don't know. You tell me.
- Will that be
good for you? Will you be
happy then if I just...?
No, just tell me. Just tell me
if you'll be happy.
- Stop it. Just go!
- Oh, I'm gonna go!
Fine, I'll go.
Will you just come back inside...
Stop it, Eliz... Shut up! Shut up!
Just come back inside.
I am trying to help you, Jim.
You're trying to help me?
You want to help me?
You're my wife, Elizabeth.
- You should support me.
- I do support you.
- Will you just come back inside...
- Hey. Hey, pal.
Hey.
You spying on me?
What?
You spying on me?
- Leave him alone, Jim.
- Come here.
- Leave him alone.
- No. You got something to say?
- I just got home.
- Come here.
- Look at how he looks at me.
- No.
- I am so sick of the way you look at me.
- It's okay, Ethan.
- It's okay.
- Just relax. Relax.
- Look at how you look at me.
- What are you doing?
- This has nothing to do with him.
- Stay out of it.
- This has nothing...
- You stay out of it!
What are you doing?
Easy. Take it easy. Take it easy.
- You're right.
- God...
You're right. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
I'm gonna...
Hey!
Don't you ever touch her again!
You hear me?
You gotta go.
Mom, he's gotta go.
He can't stay here.
Mom, you okay?
Yeah. I'm sorry.
Sure you got everything?
Just let her talk to me.
Just get in the car, Dad. I got it.
Yeah.
<i>From that moment on,</i>
<i>Ethan was the leader of our pack.</i>
<i>When we went home,
things were different.</i>
<i>Dad was gone.</i>
<i>That cat had been hiding
from me for a while.</i>
<i>And now I got it.</i>
<i>I found him!</i>
<i>Okay, sorry.</i>
Geez!
Go! Red 80. Red 80.
- Let's go, Ethan!
- Down, set, hut!
That's it. Over the top.
Good block.
<i>First down, Tigers.</i>
<i>Pass caught by wide receiver...</i>
Way to go, Ethan!
<i>First and ten for the Tigers.</i>
Come on, Tigers!
Down, set, hut!
Yeah! Yeah!
<i>Touchdown, Tigers!</i>
That was amazing.
Mom.
No.
Full scholarship. Four years.
Oh, my gosh! Really?
Okay, okay. Come on.
- Really? Oh!
- Yeah.
- Okay, you wait here. Okay, boss dog?
- <i>Okay.</i>
You wait here. I'll get you
something to eat, okay?
- <i>I just said okay.</i>
- Good boy.
Come on, baby! Let it burn!
Go, go, go, go, go! Yes!
- Ye...
- What?
- Ah, some jokers.
- Good job. Great game, great game.
- <i>I'm keeping watch.</i>
- Hey, Ethan!
- All clear.
- How you doing?
<i>What?</i>
<i>Uh-oh.</i>
<i>What was he doing here?</i>
<i>And in one of his bad moods, too.</i>
<i>I could smell it.</i>
Come on, let's go.
- Come on.
- Got his brains from his mom, huh?
Yeah, I didn't get a scholarship, though.
Hey, Dad.
Hey, pal.
What are you, uh...
what are you doing here?
Oh. Well, I saw you...
I saw you tonight, Ethan.
- You did good.
- You were at the game?
Yeah.
You got a good arm.
So everything's going good, huh?
- This guy, huh?
- Dad.
- Good game, huh?
- Dad, hey.
- We're all excited for the big win, huh?
- Dad.
Let's hear it for this guy!
You don't have to do this right now, Dad.
Come on! Come on, huh?
Would you stop this?
Hey. All right.
Come on, let's go.
Want your burger?
For Bailey?
Hey, boss dog.
Good boy.
So it's not all perfect
in Ethan Land, huh?
Now I know why you're
going to Michigan, man.
Get away from that alchy father of yours.
- You should shut up, Todd.
- Oh, yeah?
You-you don't want everyone here knowing
that your father's a drunk?
Ethan, I have to catch my bus. Please.
It's pretty obvious.
- Can we go?
- Yeah, we're going soon.
Oh, oh, and his girlfriend's
fighting his battles, too.
If Michigan State knew the real Ethan...
Whoa!
I told you to shut up, Todd.
<i>I don't like that smell.</i>
Please get in the car.
Bailey, come on!
Bailey, let's go. Get in the car.
<i>What was that?</i>
<i>Could that be that squirrel?</i>
Perfect.
<i>Todd was on our territory.</i>
<i>Oh, I wanted to bite him.</i>
<i>But I remembered Ethan
telling me no biting.</i>
<i>Then I forgot.</i>
Hey!
No, no, no, no, no!
Ethan.
Bailey.
Bailey, shut up.
Mom!
Mom, Mom, Mom!
Get up, get up, get up.
Quick, quick. Come on, quick!
- We gotta get out.
- We can't. We can't.
Come... the window.
- Come here.
- Oh, God.
Fire! Fire!
- You gotta jump.
- It's too high.
Get your sheets! Get your sheets!
- Here. Here.
- I just want to tie these together.
Anyone have a ladder handy?
We gotta help 'em down!
- Oh, God.
- It's the only way, okay?
- How many people are in the house?
- Okay.
Check the back of the house.
Somebody give me a hand!
- Go, go, go.
- We got you.
Okay, we got you. Got her.
- We got you. We got you.
- Okay.
Good boy. Good boy.
I'll check around back!
I'm here... right behind you.
Okay.
No!
Oh!
- Come on.
- Is there anything I can do?
We gotta help him down.
Come on, Ethan.
You need to jump, son.
Ethan, jump!
Ethan!
- Okay, can you move?
- My leg!
- All right, come on.
- One, two, three.
His leg.
My leg.
- You're gonna be all right.
- It's okay. You're okay.
It's okay.
Somebody hold this dog.
Hey, Bailey. Bailey, no.
No.
Go with him. Go with him.
No.
One, two, three.
It's going to be okay, boy. He'll be back.
Easy.
No. Hey, hey.
- Don't! Stop!
- There's the dog.
Somebody get the dog.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey.
What you running from, son?
I swear, it... it was an accident. I...
Why don't you tell us what happened?
I-I-I had a firework...
I think you should come with us.
But don't... please... please just...
It was an accident.
Fran! Fran, come on, come on, come on.
- They're here?
- They're here, they're here.
- Okay.
- Be careful, dear.
I'm... I'm being careful.
I'm being careful.
- Hi.
- Hey, sweetie.
- Good to see you.
- Oh!
Oh, look at you.
Here, here, let...
- I-I got it.
- Fran, Fran, Fran, Fran.
Stop it. Stop.
Good to see you, Ethan.
Yeah. You, too.
I've been baking all day.
Got your room all set up for you, Ethan.
It's so good to have you here.
<i>Ethan never wanted to play anymore.</i>
Oh, Bailey.
I'm so sorry.
<i>Even though he carried</i>
<i>a great new stick everywhere he went.</i>
Bailey, come on. Hey!
Come here, Bailey.
- No, no, no, no, no, Bailey.
- Bailey.
Come on. Come on.
<i>I couldn't make him play with me.</i>
<i>All he wanted to do was sleep.</i>
<i>I had a lot of free time now,
so I made a new friend.</i>
<i>It was like a small horse.</i>
<i>Or a giant dog.</i>
<i>With its own special smell</i>
<i>that was so wonderful and disgusting.</i>
<i>Oh, I wished I could roll in it.</i>
<i>Oh, we had fun.</i>
<i>Until we didn't.</i>
<i>At least Hannah still came around.</i>
Hey!
- Hey.
- Hi, Bailey.
Hi. Hi.
I missed you, too.
Good boy. Good boy.
Ah, you're such a good boy.
Come on. Come on!
- Hey.
- Hey.
You, um... do you want
to go to the pond?
I made some sandwiches.
Yeah.
I mean...
Yeah, if you want.
I just... I thought it'd be nice
if we could get out
of the house, get you out.
What?
Look, Hannah, it's nice for you to try,
but you don't have to...
you don't have to do this.
You don't have to help me.
I'm not doing it for you.
I'm doing it for us. I want...
No, you're doing this for me.
You leave for college in three weeks.
But I'll be back all the time.
Uh-huh, and I'll be here.
With that.
You have to stop feeling
sorry for yourself.
You can't do this for me, Hannah.
I'd do anything for you.
I don't think we should be with
each other anymore, Hannah.
Whoa.
We shouldn't be with each other anymore.
It's not gonna work.
I'm sorry.
Why are you doing this?
Bailey.
Good boy.
Yeah.
You want your ball?
Okay, here's your ball.
Go on.
Bye, Bailey.
<i>Wait. Wait, no.</i>
<i>No, stay.</i>
<i>I really missed Hannah.</i>
<i>Ethan missed her, too.</i>
<i>I could tell.</i>
Ethan, I made you a sandwich.
I'm gonna put it in the backseat, okay?
- All right, Fran.
- Bailey, Bailey, Bailey, Bailey...
Good boy.
You're gonna miss me, huh?
I'm gonna miss you, too.
Don't look so glum, women.
It-it's a good agricultural school.
He's gonna learn everything
he needs to know
about running this farm.
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes, absolutely. Yes.
All right, go on. Come on.
Better grab him.
He's not gonna understand.
Come here.
- Good boy. Good boy.
- Have you got the dog?
Let's come here.
- Stay, Bailey, stay.
- Come on, boy.
Great day, huh?
He's so grown-up.
What's he doing?
Oh!
Oh, my goodness.
Good boy, Bailey.
You keep that for me, okay, Bailey?
- Caught it.
- Yeah.
Bye, Ethan.
Drive safe.
See you, Ethan!
No, Bailey.
- Stay.
- You got him, honey?
<i>Stay? We're playing fetch.</i>
Bailey!
<i>It's been so long since we've played.</i>
Bailey.
<i>I like this new version of fetch.</i>
You're crazy, you know that, boss dog?
<i>Maybe not... drive so far next time.</i>
Take care of things around
here for me, okay, boy?
I'll be back soon.
Promise.
Come on. Go on. Go home.
<i>Humans are complicated.</i>
<i>They do things dogs can't understand.</i>
<i>Like leave.</i>
<i>Ethan and I were meant to be together.</i>
<i>But if there was no Ethan,</i>
<i>what was the point of my being here?</i>
<i>Maybe the point was
not to look for a point.</i>
Okay, hold on. Hold on.
Okay.
I'll be right back, Bailey.
<i>Everything moved at a slower pace now.</i>
<i>Which was okay,</i>
<i>because I never felt like running anymore.</i>
<i>I was tired all the time.</i>
<i>I didn't feel like playing anymore.</i>
<i>Not even with horse-dog.</i>
Hey, Bailey.
Are you okay, boy?
Bill?
- Careful. Keep a...
- Okay.
Okay, let's see what we have here.
His eyes just didn't look right.
They just, uh... they were...
they were kind of rheumy.
And he... and he was panting,
he was, uh...
his breathing was labored.
He's-he's also got
this little lump in his, uh...
Oh, yeah. Has he been drinking
- a lot of water and peeing?
- No.
Lethargic, so he... he doesn't
want to go for walks anymore?
I had to carry him into the car.
What can we do for him, Doctor?
What do you think?
Well, we-we... we could do testing,
but I'm afraid that it would
probably be the same results.
His... his kidneys are shutting down.
Can we just...
<i>Everyone was so sad,</i>
<i>but I was too tired to cheer them up.</i>
Dr. Joyce, can I, uh...
can I use your phone?
Yes. Oh, absolutely.
Doctor, Doctor, uh,
if this was a person...
If this was a person...
You're the veterinarian...
If this was a person,
would you say that...
Uh, hello.
Yeah, uh, I'm looking for Ethan.
It's his grandpa, Bill.
Ethan, it's Grandpa.
<i>Ethan.</i>
<i>Are you here?</i>
<i>I can't smell you.</i>
<i>Where are you?</i>
Hey, Bailey.
<i>There he was.</i>
<i>I could tell he was still sad.</i>
<i>I didn't want him to be sad.</i>
Doodle dog.
Boss dog, huh?
<i>I knew I was here to love
Ethan and make him happy.</i>
Oh, Bailey, Bailey, Bailey, Bailey.
<i>I didn't want to leave him like this.</i>
Good boy.
Good boy, Bailey.
Don't worry.
He'll just feel a little...
A little prick in his neck,
and then the pain will go away.
<i>And then it happened again.</i>
<i>The mother, the milk,</i>
<i>the tongue, the warmth.</i>
<i>I was back.</i>
<i>But why?</i>
<i>Where was Ethan?</i>
<i>Other things were missing, too.</i>
<i>I didn't have a...</i>
<i>What? I'm a girl?</i>
Come on, come on!
Good girl, good girl.
<i>My man was very serious.</i>
Look.
- Over. Over. Good girl!
- <i>We worked hard.</i>
<i>Even when we played,
he made it feel like work.</i>

Do you remember what time it was...

it was kidnapping.

Hey. Hi.
Hi.
- Cute dog.
- Uh-huh. Thanks.
Um, listen, uh, a few of us
are putting together a study group.
We're meeting at the Woodford common room.
We'd love for you to join us.
Um, I would, but I have plans, so...
Oh... oh, but I didn't say
when we was meeting.
No.
No, I just... I'm busy. I...
Like, I know I'm gonna
be busy and, like...
I got my dog, so I gotta...
- Oh.
- Thank you. I gotta go.
I'm sorry. I have to take
my dog out, so...

- But thank you.
Okay.
- Maybe next time.
- Uh, yeah.
I don't know what's wrong with me, Tino.
Like, yeah, maybe it would be
nice to meet people, but...
no, also I should just
study alone 'cause...
<i>Slow down. Slow down.</i>
<i>My legs are barely even legs.</i>
Ugh! I feel like such an idiot.

Ugh. Do you know, I'm spending

You want to go get some ice cream?
<i>You read my mind.</i>

Maya, I want you to be my wife.

- What?
<i>Oh, no.</i>
- <i>It was a baby.</i>
- Is she breathing?
You gotta relax, honey.
She's breathing, okay?
Uh, maybe we should
wake her up just to be sure.
<i>I didn't understand why they got a baby.</i>
<i>It took all their attention.</i>
<i>Good thing Roxy and I already
had everything we needed.</i>
<i>Each other.</i>
Hey, baby.
<i>Then they went and got more babies.</i>
<i>Seemed like a mistake to me.</i>
<i>Soon, I had to live my life on the run.</i>
Found him!
<i>There was no escape.</i>
<i>I let them do what they wanted to me.</i>
<i>I'd do anything
so that Roxy could be safe.</i>
<i>That was my mission,

<i>I guess, if I was really honest,</i>

Boo!
<i>As Roxy and I got older,
our connection grew stronger.</i>
<i>And she never lost the spark</i>

- Oh!
Everyone was good to me.
<i>But as the years went by, I missed Roxy.</i>
<i>It just wasn't the same without her.</i>
Hey, Tino.
Hey, Tino.
You know what I'm thinking?
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>I know what you're thinking.</i>
Pizza.
<i>Ugh.</i>
No?
No pizza?
<i>I'm not hungry.</i>
Okay.
Tino...
what are you thinking?
Hmm?
What are you thinking?
Tino, what are you thinking?
<i>I'm thinking I'm ready.</i>
<i>One of my best lives, really.</i>
<i>I'm back.</i>
<i>Again.</i>
<i>But why?</i>
- Puppies! Want a puppy?
- Hey there, little fella.
- Puppies for sale!
- Want to buy one?
Who wants a puppy?
Hi!
Oh!
<i>Here we go again.</i>
Look what I got. Huh?
Yeah, I am looking.
Look how cute he is.
You know, it's-it's crazy.
Who's gonna take care of him?
I will.
Come on. I named him Waffles.
Not inside.
Come on.
I kept telling her you were
going to get bigger.
Not so into you now, is she?
<i>I never went anywhere.</i>
<i>I never played.</i>
<i>It was like the days
went on and on without me.</i>
<i>You have 30 days to deal with this.</i>
<i>When the officer came,</i>
<i>I thought it was to take me
to do find-and-show.</i>
<i>But she left without me.</i>
He's dirty. We're getting rid of him.
We are not going to get rid of that dog.
That's enough! We're getting rid of him.
I took him in here, and
we're gonna take care of him.
You'll make sure he finds
a nice home, right?
Somebody responsible?
Yeah.
Come on. Out.
Move it.
Let's go. Come on.
Move.
So long, doggie.
Now I'm supposed to walk home?
<i>That didn't seem very fair.</i>
<i>But when I thought about it,</i>
<i>I didn't want to go back to that home.</i>
Come on. Over here.
Look, Mom.
<i>That looks like fun.</i>
Sit. Sit. You like that?
<i>It's been so long since I've had fun.</i>
Where is she going?
<i>Do I know you?</i>
<i>There's something about you.</i>
<i>It's... your smell.</i>
Aw.
You're a scruffy one.
Are you lost?
Where are you from?
You got a collar?
<i>I know that smell.</i>
Don't be afraid.
<i>It's... from a long time ago.</i>
<i>Had I been here before?</i>
<i>I was so happy to leave the town behind.</i>
<i>My nose was full of fresh new smells.</i>
<i>And then there are the smells
you never forget.</i>
<i>Train. Moss.</i>
<i>Trees. Horse. Garbage.</i>
<i>It was horse-dog!</i>
<i>Could it be the same?</i>
<i>Ah, it was the same.</i>
<i>Could it mean Ethan was here, too?</i>
That ought to cover us
to the end of the month.
<i>Ethan?</i>
<i>That can't be him.</i>
Tell Fred that I will be in town...
<i>Is that him?</i>
...tomorrow to settle up, okay?
Will do.
<i>It is him!</i>
<i>It's him! Yes!</i>
<i>Yes, it's him!</i>
Hey! Hey! Hey!
<i>It's me!</i>
<i>Boss dog! Bailey, Bailey, Bailey.</i>
- <i>Doodle dog!</i>
- Hey!
Where'd you come from?
<i>After all these lives,
I'd actually found him.</i>
<i>I found Ethan.</i>
I'm gonna make a bet you're hungry.
Here you go.
Wow.
You must be.
Nobody likes my cooking.
Don't look at me like that.
You can't stay here.
You gotta go home.
You belong to somebody.
<i>Home. Yes.</i>
<i>Yes, I'm home.</i>
Go home, dog.
Go home.
You're a stubborn one, aren't you?
<i>Then, Tuesday night,</i>
<i>we got three tenths of an inch of rain.</i>
Be sure he gets a good home.
He's a good dog.
Sure.
<i>No. No, don't leave me here.</i>
<i>This is a white-coat place.</i>
<i>I belong with you.</i>
So long, dog.
You want to get out of here?
Do you want to go?
Come on, let's go.
<i>I was back in the front seat.</i>
Okay, buddy.
Guess it's gonna be you and me.
And the donkey.
<i>What's a donkey?</i>
Now, when was the last time
you got a bath?
That's a good boy.
Yeah.
There you go. All right.
Just step out. Out. Let's go!
There you go.
You're getting a new collar.
Yeah!
Doesn't look like he's
missed too many meals.
- He's in good shape.
- Yeah, he's a good boy.
Aren't you, huh?
<i>But Ethan still seemed sad.</i>
<i>Maybe it was because he slept alone.</i>
<i>I wanted to help him,
but I didn't know how.</i>
<i>Wait. Wait.</i>
<i>Hold that thought.</i>
<i>Okay, Bailey, let's do this.</i>
<i>Hurry.</i>
<i>Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.</i>
<i>This is the place.</i>
<i>I'm looking for...</i>
Come on, Carly. Come here, girl.
- Come on, Carly.
- Come on, Carly.
Come here, Carly.
Can you get the gate for me?
- Yes, Mommy.
- Thank you.
Good girl.
<i>Oh, sorry.</i>
Rach.
Oh, hey. Look, Will.
- Grandma's here.
- Hi, Grandma.
<i>There's that smell again.</i>
- How are you feeling?
- I'm pretty good.
This is a surprise.
<i>It's stronger now.</i>
I thought I'd bring you some groceries.
- <i>It's Hannah!</i>
- Aw. Hmm, thanks.
<i>You're still here?</i>
<i>Oh, you look different.</i>
<i>But you still smell like biscuits.</i>
Who is this?
It's the, uh, stray from the park.
A stray? Really?
Well, hello there.
What a good dog.
Well, he's certainly not a stray,
'cause he's got a collar.
Let's see.
His name is Buddy.
Let's see. He belongs to...
<i>Come on, Ethan.</i>
<i>I can smell you in there.</i>
I don't want to leave you here.
But I guess he's not home.
Hi, Ethan.
Hi, Hannah.
I brought your dog home.
Must have been tough on you,
losing your husband
after all those years.
Yeah, it made me miss my daughter a lot.
And then, with the new baby coming,
I thought Rachel and Miguel
could really use the help.
Yeah.
How long you get to stay for?
Uh, well, I'm... I'm not visiting, Ethan.
I moved back about a month ago.
Y-You did?
Welcome home.
Thanks.
Well, this place is still the same.
Yeah.
<i>Oh, come on.</i>
So, what about you?
You... you never met anyone or...
Never found the right fit.
Mm-hmm.
I'm really stubborn.
I know that.
When you put your mind
to something, that was that.
Yeah.
That's good for getting things done.
It's not so good for relationships.
- Uh...
- Mmm.
Okay, well...
<i>Okay, here we go.</i>
<i>They're gonna lick faces.</i>
Well, look, this was really nice.
I gotta go.
Thank you, Ethan.
<i>Wait, what?</i>
<i>Oh, come on!</i>
Hey, thanks for bringing back my dog.
You're welcome. Bye.
Hey, Hannah.
I, uh...
I owe you an apology.
For what happened to us.
Back then.
Well, don't worry.
It was a long, long time ago.
No.
I pushed you away.
And I was... I was
really mad at the world.
And I just want you to know
that not a day goes by
that I don't kick myself for doing that.
<i>There's that sweaty smell.</i>
You think, uh,
it'd be crazy if...
we did something together?
Are you asking me out on a date?
Well, I just think that
I'd be an all-time fool
if I just watched you drive away.
<i>Enough talking. Use your nose.</i>
Then don't.
<i>Okay, now you're getting it.</i>
<i>Yes! Yes!</i>
<i>Get out of here.</i>
<i>Give 'em some space.</i>
Few right there, that's why...
Hi, you little cutie pie.
Ew. My water has mint in it.
You have a good time?
<i>Once they started licking faces,</i>
<i>no one could stop them.</i>
<i>Ethan finally had what he needed.</i>
<i>He was happy.</i>
<i>I was happy, too.</i>
Excuse me, everybody.
I-I would like to thank you all
for coming here today.
It means a lot to Hannah and I.
I've always wanted a big family.
All in one day, I've got one.
You didn't tell me how big it was.
I just would like to say
how grateful I am,
that my beautiful girl
walked back into my life.
- Aw.
- Thank you.
Life's a mystery.
Cheers.
<i>There was one thing I still wanted.</i>
<i>I wanted him to know it was me.</i>
We had so much fun last night.
<i>That I was Bailey.</i>
What a great night.
Stop.
You were amazing.
Yeah. You, too.
- Wait, didn't Bailey used to do that?
- Yeah.
It's a dog thing.
<i>Bailey. I'm Bailey.</i>
<i>There's gotta be a way.</i>
<i>Hmm. Wait.</i>
<i>That's familiar.</i>
<i>I smelled... me.</i>
What do you got there?
Where did you find that?
Hey.
You want to play?
Get ready.
You have to really go after this one.
Go get it.
Good boy!
Come on, bring it here.
Good one.
All right.
You go play, all right?
Gotta get back.
What? What do you want?
This is nuts.
All right, Buddy.
You want to go for the showstopper?
You want to try it? You want to get it?
Ready?
I am ready.
Okay. Go!
Where did you learn how to do that, Buddy?
You are really starting
to freak me out, boss dog.
<i>Yes, Ethan, that's right.</i>
<i>I'm your boss dog. I'm Bailey.</i>
<i>Say it.</i>
Boss dog?
Are you the boss dog?
No.
<i>Yes. It's me, Ethan.</i>
<i>It's me.</i>
Bailey?
Bailey.
Boss dog.
Bailey, Bailey, Bailey.
Bailey, Bailey.
Aw.
Mmm, yeah.
<i>So, in all my lives as a dog,</i>
<i>here's what I've learned.</i>
<i>Have fun, obviously.</i>
<i>Whenever possible,</i>
<i>find someone to save, and save them.</i>
<i>Lick the ones you love.</i>
<i>Don't get all sad-faced
about what happened</i>
<i>and scrunchy-faced about what could.</i>
- <i>Just be here now.</i>
- Go!
Okay, go get it.
- <i>Be here now.</i>
- That's it.
<i>That's a dog's purpose.</i>
