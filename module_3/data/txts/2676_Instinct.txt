My name is Dylan Reinhart.
Not too long ago,
I was an operative in the CIA
known as Agent Reinhart.
When I left the Agency
and started teaching,
I became Professor Reinhart.
I wrote a book
about abnormal behavior
and criminals,
which was so successful
a serial killer used it
as clues for his murders.
That's when the
New York Police Department
reached out to me
to help catch him.
Which I did, so they hired me,
and I became
Consultant Reinhart.
So now I'm working
with this woman,
Detective Lizzie Needham
of the homicide division,
catching killers.
Looks like I need a new name.
Don't they call you
Professor Psychopath?
Don't overdo it today, Gary.
Pace yourself.
Surprise!
Whoa.
Bad time?
No. No, it's never a bad time
to see my little sister.
LIZZIE: Um...Hi!
Hi!
You look amazing,
as usual.
What, is everything okay?
Everything's great. Why?
Well, I just... I, uh...
I haven't seen you
since Christmas,
and you live in Boulder, and...
here you are in my house.
I have a job thing.
Okay.
So you're here
looking for a job.
That's good. Great.
Really great news.
Well, are you taking off?
There's a murder
I need to get to.It's cool.
I'll just chill with Gary.
I know where everything is.
Okay. Let me know
if you need anything.Okay.
MAN:
Photo, get a shot of that.
Hey, Doc.
Good morning, Detective.
Uh, not so far.
What have we got?
Those two lovebirds right here
were on their way
to a romantic encounter
and literally tripped
over the remains.
DYLAN: I'm guessing
that killed the mood.
Our vic's a John Doe.
Unis searched the
area for a weapon.
Nothing so far. You need
anything, let me know.
Okay.
Thanks.
ZACK: I'm keeping
the lookie-loos away.
He's just a kid.
Can't be older than 18 or 19.
Aw.
The hem on his pants
is hand-stitched.
Probably done by his mother.
Makes it sadder somehow.
We'll run these
through facial recognition.
Key ring, no keys.
Maybe they were stolen.
Or maybe it's just
a good-luck amulet.
Guess it didn't
do much good.
Rigor's not far along.
He's been dead
six hours max.
Single slice made
with a straight-edge blade,
possibly a hunting knife.
No hesitation marks.
Do you understand the level
of aggression it takes
to make that cut
with one stroke?
And to throw away the body,
not even try to hide it--
just get rid of it
like it's garbage--
demonstrates a flagrant
disregard for societal norms
and a chilling lack of empathy.
Whoever did this is a savage.
"Savage" means
merely uncivilized.
This is the work of a sociopath,
a far more
dangerous creature.
DYLAN:
Caleb Troyer, 19.
Dixons Corners, New York.
How far upstate is that?Two hours.
Uh, local sheriff said
the family belongs
to a strict
religious community.
Yeah, I have it here.
"The church espouses
an ascetic life,
eschewing modern technology,
including phones and computers."
"Espouses" and "eschewing"
in one sentence
is just showing off.
So they're, like, Amish?
Kind of but not.
"Formal education
ceases at 13."
Wow. Some religions
reject Satan.
They reject high school.
WOMAN:
I just spoke to him Saturday
on the pay phone
at the post office.
Why did Caleb
move to New York?
To find work.
He went with another boy
from the church, Seth Weber,
about six months ago.
But I just spoke
to his parents, and
they said that Seth
told them that he and Caleb
hadn't been living together
for some time.
LIZZIE:
What did Caleb
do in the city?
Construction.
He'd send us
a hundred dollars every week.
Alice.
You people from the government?
New York City Police, sir.
We're trying to find out
what happened to your son.
Do you know who Caleb
spent time with in New York?
We don't know much
about his life in the city.
Boy always kept secrets.
Well, a lot
of teenagers do.
We got things to do.
Do you mind if we take
a look at Caleb's room?
♪
No posters.
No electronics.
If I was a teenager,
I might want to get
out of here, too.
Nice quilt, though.
Hand-stitched.
They just lost
their son,
yet no warmth between them.
Must have taken a lot
of courage for Caleb
to defy such
a domineering father
and move to New York.
LIZZIE:
I bet the mom was Caleb's ally.
Look.
Oh, those are
the same feathers
that were on
his key ring.
What are those?
Popsicle sticks?He kept them.
In a lockbox.
They must have meant
something to him.
Mrs. Troyer, do you know
what these are?
I've never seen them before.
LIZZIE:
Mm-hmm.
ALICE:
That photograph
of Caleb,
do you think it might
be possible
that I could keep it?
Yes, of course. Here.
Thank you.
LIZZIE:
Caleb would've had a rough go
in my family.
We were always
in each other's business.
He definitely had
a private life.
I don't think he
went to New York
to find work.
I think the move was...
more personal.
Man, there's
nothing personal.
Just like his room at home.
If 85% of the people born
into the community
stay within the church
their entire lives,
I wonder what happens
to the other 15%.
You think it could be
someone from the church?
Well, the church
defines its own rules,
and Caleb's father
clearly disapproved
of his decisions.
Ooh. Blood.
LIZZIE: Get a photo.
We need CSU here.
Well, well, well.
Looks like Caleb
was having a party.
One with lipstick, one without.
One joint with lipstick.
Hmm.
Hey! Stop!
Hiding in the closet?
Seriously?
♪
There's nothing going on,
Officer.
Then why were
you standing
in a closet?
That's why.
Who are you?
Seth Weber.
You're who Caleb
moved down here with.
I live with my girlfriend now.
DYLAN: What would your church
think about the weed?
About you breaking
into Caleb's room?
I didn't break in.
The door was unlocked.
And I didn't do this.
I got here right before you.
I came to get the money.
Caleb's loaning me $95 for rent.
He keeps his money
in the sock drawer.
We don't trust banks
where we're from.
The money's gone.
Caleb's dead, Seth.
He was killed.
Dead?
What...
When was the last time
you saw him?
Friday, when I
asked to borrow...
You think I did it?Maybe he didn't
lend you the money.
You and Caleb fought.
No way.
DYLAN:
Maybe he was gonna
tell your parents
about you smoking weed,
about you living in sin
with your girl.
Caleb wouldn't do that.
He was loyal.
Besides, he's the one
who had secrets.
What kind of secrets?
I don't know,
but he...
he used to disappear for hours
and never tell anyone
where he was going.
Even back home,
there was times he'd tell
his folks he was at work
and I knew that wasn't true.
Who were Caleb's friends here?
Did he have a girlfriend?
I don't know. He...
I told him we were
having a party.
He said the girl he was seeing
had a curfew
and the guard wouldn't
let her in after 10:00.
The guard?
I told you,
the dude had secrets.
Does this girl have a name?
Nicki.
Said he met her in the park.
Seth's alibi holds.
He was at his girlfriend's
cousin's place in Jersey
when Caleb was killed.Uh-huh.
Caleb's dad
has no record,
but since the church
polices itself,
that doesn't mean anything.
They're not being
very cooperative.
Blood on the drawer
was Caleb's,
as was the DNA
on one beer bottle.
DNA on the other bottle
and the joint belonged to...
Unknown female,
presumably Nicki,
who lives somewhere
with a guard.
College dorms don't have
a 10:00 p.m. curfew.
Rehab facility,
halfway house, shelter?
We're gonna be knocking
on a lot of doors.
What are you doing?One second.
32 black.
How much do you bet
there are 56 white?
Okay, Rain Man. Why 56?
Because there are
88 keys on a piano.
Piano?Well, a practice keyboard.
I had one when I was a kid.
I think Caleb
kept these hidden
because he was ashamed.
His church considers
music a gateway to sin.
And... the feathers are
from an eastern blue jay,
a songbird.
Keeping with the musical theme.
Mm-hmm.
Okay, so where does
a kid like Caleb
learn to play the piano?In every small town,
there's at least
one piano teacher.
DYLAN:
What was Caleb like?
Caleb was such
a dear boy
and so talented.
After his third
lesson, he could play
Bach's Concerto in
D Minor by ear.
Mm-hmm.
So, Mrs. Porter, you were...
saying Caleb worked
for your husband?
At his construction firm.
Caleb came by the
house a few years ago
when I was with a student,
and he was fascinated.
And after she left,
I suggested he
touch a few keys.
Well, he was shy at first,
but...
the boy was a natural.
So you started
giving him lessons?
I never charged him.
He was a true prodigy.
Was Caleb conflicted
about his playing?
Oh, yes.
The church, his father.
He hated keeping
the secret.
He'd be at our house
for hours playing.
But he had
such a gift.
He was so happy
at the piano.
So, he went to New York
to study piano?
And stayed to apply
to Juilliard.
Juilliard tapes
all the auditions.
Caleb sent me the link.
I sure appreciate you letting me
play for you today.
MAN: Mr. Troyer,
you're very talented.
He is very talented.
DYLAN:
Wait.
Do you know who that is?
Caleb said her
name was Nicki.
WOMAN:
Nicki Jones.
She stayed at our
shelter for six weeks.
She just left
a few days ago.
Do you know where she went,
why she left,
anything about her family?
Kids come and go
all the time.
I've never seen
a teenager
on a landline before.
Our kids are runaways,
throwaways.
They don't have cells,
so I let them use
our phones
to call home.
Did you ever
see Nicki with Caleb?
No.
She was always with this
sullen-looking mouth breather.
I call them
"Beauty and the Bro."
Does "Bro" have a name?
"Gene" is all I know.
He's not one
of ours.
The last day she was
here, they were arguing
about this photographer,
talent agent
or whatever he is.
He said he could get
her some modeling jobs.
He stole her bag or something.
He left some fliers.
Jimmy, it's me, Arvin.
Are you smelling that?
What is that?Decomp.
You didn't notice this smell?
I got allergies.
Thank you.
Purplish discoloration,
early decomposition,
dried blood
from his nose and mouth.
He's been dead
at least 48 hours,
which puts him out of the
running for killing Caleb.
Single, deep cut to the throat.
Fixed straight-edge blade.
Our killer has a signature move.
Two bodies in 48 hours.
Are we dealing with a serial?
Serials generally have
a cooling-off period
between their hits,
usually a few weeks,
and they rarely know
their victims.
No, this is a spree killer.
Rageful, ruthless.
Unlike serial killers,
spree killers don't need
a cooling-off time
between murders,
which means we're going to find
another body very soon.
Fucci and Harris are canvassing.
So far, nobody knows nothin'.
Could this be the bag
he stole from Nicki?
Hmm.
Yeah.
Here's her shelter I.D.
Lipstick, some condoms.
LIZZIE:
Nicki's sister
Hmm.
Oh. Looks like Nicki
was an artist.
Oh, my God.
Wait, is that
meant to be...
Caleb?
There wasn't a
marsh in the park.
She signs her stuff
"El Más Loco."
In Spanish, that means
"the craziest one."
But no, it's the male
form of the word.
Maybe Gene was the artist.
And the killer?
To kill men
this viciously,
you'd have to have
power, strength.
Well, spree killings
are normally triggered
by an emotional upheaval.
Maybe Gene was controlling
his compulsions,
and then they exploded.
Why now?
What makes him let go now?
The trigger can often
be humiliation.
If Gene was in a
relationship with Nicki,
and then he found out
she'd been with Caleb
and this photographer,
maybe that's what set him
over the edge, and...
he killed them both.
And made art from it?
Whoever did this was a
malignant narcissist.
He didn't want anyone else to
take credit for what he'd done.
He would brag about
it if he knew
he wasn't going
to get caught.
He could brag about it
anonymously on the Internet.
Finding El Más Loco's work
wasn't easy,
but we traced messages
from him on anime sites
that linked to this Web site,
BloodAndGore.com, where he
posted his work from a laptop
using proxies
to hide his IP address.
You think El Más Loco
is this kid Gene?
DYLAN:
Yeah.
Gene was going out with
Nicki, who was also
with Caleb and
the photographer.
And we found El Más Loco's
sketchbook in her bag--
no readable fingerprints.
Prints are tough
to find on paper.
Then we found
these two drawings.
They seem to be our victims
and were posted yesterday online
using a cell phone.
We track the cell,
we find El Más Loco.
DYLAN:
Oh, we got the number.
D.A.'s office
is getting a subpoena
to I.D. who it's registered to.
Hopefully
by end of day tomorrow.
This guy's killed
twice in two days.
We could have another
victim by then.
Let me see if I can
speed things up.
ANDY:
As you can see, the, uh...
the foot traffic
we generate's
actually better
than your projections.
My proposal
is to give you
a percentage of the profits
in lieu of rent.
That way, you get
to participate
in our success.
And, of course, you get
all the free
drinks you want.
Yeah, you see, the thing is,
is that this corner is gold.
This place is always packed,
which is why I want
to put in my own restaurant,
you know, keep all the profits
and the free drinks.
Are you kidding me?
No...
Uh, in the past five years,
there have been
three different restaurants
in this space.
All of them have failed.
It's not the corner
that's valuable.
And it's not the
drinks or the food
or the theme or the fact
that he works harder
than everyone else
that makes Rafters so popular.
It's Andy. It's his ability
to make everyone
who walks through that door
feel like they belong here,
like this is home.
That's his gift.
If you have that gift,
then knock yourself out,
because this
is a risky business
and you have
a sure thing right here.
I'll get back to you.
No. No.
This is a
one-time-only offer.
We think it's
more than fair.
You get a piece
of our hard work,
with none of the risk.
So... you decide if
it's worth it for you.
You got 48 hours.
You'll have my answer.
Did I overplay our hand?
I slightly overplayed...
No, no, you were like a shark.
You were scrappy
and cutthroat and sexy.
If he's too dumb
to take a great deal,
then we will find another corner
and you will work
your magic there.
♪
What time's the cage fight?
Undercard at 6:00,
and then the main event.
You should come.
There are still tickets.
I'm good.
Well, no, I'm not good.
No.
Caleb.
You see yourself
in him.
I was lucky to have a mother
who understood me,
and not to cross paths
with a murderer.
I have to go.
Enjoy.
Thanks. Sorry for the mess.
MAN:
Okay.
Thanks for nothing!
Loser!
Sorry for the excitement, guys.
This is my sister.
She's just visiting.Listen.
I know that I threw up
in his cab, but...
he wasn't gonna let me go
until I gave him money,
and that is basically
kidnapping.
I'm fine.Of course you are.
I'm gonna pay you back.
That's okay.
You know what I was thinking?
I could be a cop.
Because I like helping people,
and I'm a closet
excitement junkie.
Yeah, I think that runs
in the family.
Hey.
Hey.
How was the MMA?
Nice cage fight?
Uh, I suppose, yeah.
Jasmine had the subpoena
fast-tracked.
Turned out the phone
belonged to the photographer.
Gene must have stolen it
from him when he killed him.
TARU triangulated the signal
and traced it
here-- the home of
Dr. and Mrs. Higgins.
Gene's parents.
Oh, and guess what.
Turns out Gene has an open
warrant for possession.
Look. Nicki.
Get her. I'll look
out for him. Go.
Nicki Jones? NYPD.
Gene Higgins?
NYPD.
Stop!
What's this?
Now talk to me.
Screw you, bitch.
I'm not saying a word.
I'll call
my parents' lawyer.
You'll be the one
having to talk.
Shut up, Gene.
I hope your daddy's lawyer
is smarter than you are.
I tossed him.Yes, ma'am.
Do your parents know
you're in New York?
I'm not sure.
You don't want
to get them involved.
I understand,
but you have to
explain yourself, Nicki.
My name isn't Nicki.
I don't know what it is.
I can't remember who I
am or where I'm from.
Please help me.
I can't remember anything.
This is Dr. Chandler.
She's a psychiatrist.
We'll be assessing
your condition.
This was in
your backpack.
Do you recognize her?
No.
The farthest back you remember
is six weeks ago,
finding yourself
in Times Square?
I didn't have any money or I.D.
I didn't know where I came from.
I-I'm hearing a slight coastal
New England accent.
Is it possible
you're from Boston?
Or, uh, Rhode Island?
Maine?
Did you go to the police?
I met Gene.
He took me to the shelter,
and he said I'd be safe there.
Things were good.
Till I met that creepy
photographer
a couple weeks ago.
And what happened with him?
He said he'd pay me to model.
When I went there,
he tried to...
I got away,
but I left my bag.
Hold on. Did Gene
confront the photographer
after he tried to...?
I don't know.
But he said I wouldn't
have to worry about him anymore.
Then I saw his drawing.
The one of the photographer
with his throat sliced
that he put online?
Yeah.
And then you met Caleb
in the park?
He took me to dinner, and...
I went back to his room.
I saw him a few more times
after, but...
Gene caught us
and, like, lost it.
Tried to hit me.
Caleb stopped him.
I ran away.
Later, Gene said, if I ever
try to leave him again,
he'll kill me.
Did he tell you
that Caleb was dead?
I saw the drawing.
How did you feel
when you realized
Caleb had been murdered?
I kept thinking
it could have been me.
Hey. Can you give these
to Lizzie for me?
I'm kind of in a hurry.
Oh.
MMA tickets.
She went last night.
I messed that up.
Big surprise.
Those are sort of
a thank-you.
Or an apology.
You know how it is
with sisters.
Actually, I don't.
When you have a big sister,
especially one like Lizzie,
it's kind of like
having an extra mom.
You know, she was always
looking out for me as a kid.
Kept me out of trouble.
You should give her these
yourself.
I don't
really need to see
how I let her down again.
Forensics says nothing puts Gene
at either crime scene.
No blood, no fingerprints,
no fibers, not even a hair.
He had hands on these guys.
There has to be
some trace of him.
Am I missing something?
Does this seem right to you?
None of it seems
right to me.
His priors are for possession--
nothing violent.
All we have on him is
what Nicki gave us.
Oh, your, um, sister
bought these.
As an apology or a thank-you.
I couldn't quite tell.
Oh, then I guess
we're all good.
She knows she upset you.
:
Of course.
That's Katie's way.
She decides what's real.
So does Nicki.
What?
All we have
is what she gave us.
She's creating the narrative.
What if Nicki is our killer?
She controlled
the victims somehow.
She had no empathy for that boy.
I think she's the malignant
narcissist, not Gene.
I think she's a sociopath.
Okay. What's her motive?
She says the photographer
tried to rape her,
but why kill Caleb?
I don't know.
Hmm. That's a first.
I'm only saying that
to motivate
my unconscious to work faster.
Narcissists need to show off.
Well, in that case,
having to keep
these two murders a secret
must be driving her crazy.
Yes. Good.
She must be dying
to let us know how clever
she is, to get our praise.
So let's give it to her,
then take it away.
Make her angry
and see how careless she gets.
Huh.
I guess I did know after all.
My lawyer said,
since I have amnesia,
they'll wipe out the charges
against me if I testify.
You know, I didn't
like that lady doctor,
the way she looked
at me all judgy.
But I could tell
we clicked.
You'll be asked to explain
why your DNA
is all over both victims.
That creepy photographer
was all over me.
And I slept with Caleb.
In the park,
where he was killed?
Yeah, under the stars.
It was actually very sweet.
Until Gene showed up.
You have an answer
for everything.
So, Nicki, did Gene
ever tell you
that he killed
Jim or Caleb?
He never did.
Did you see anything
that might implicate him?
Bloody clothes,
shoes, the knife?
We know the knife
was cleaned with bleach.
Did you maybe see him
buy the bleach?
I need you to dig deep,
really think.
There's, like... nothing.
Thing is, Nicki...
there's no evidence that Gene
was at either crime scene.
And these are
fingers-in-the-flesh murders.
It's very difficult not
to leave something behind.
It's as if a ghost
committed the perfect crime.
Twice.
Guess you guys will just have
to look harder
to prove Gene did it.
But no matter how hard we look,
you and I both know
that we won't find anything
because Gene
was never there.
The only person
who was at both crime scenes...
is you.
Is this the part where you
ask me if I killed them?
I guess it is. Yeah.
Why would you even think that?
Because you don't
understand empathy.
It's not your fault.
You can mimic it.
You can recognize it in others.
But...
you never fully comprehend it.
That's your proof?
I have no proof.
Because there isn't any.
Not yet.
Everyone makes a mistake.
It's just
a matter of time.
JASMINE:
So you think the amnesia
is a crock
I do.
Why choose amnesia?
It doesn't insulate her
from the murders.
It only hides her past,
which seems clean.
She's not in the system.
She may not have been
our problem up till now,
but she was somebody's.
You don't just start
with murder.
Not a murder this well-planned,
this violent, this intimate.
You work up to it.
She's a sociopath, a predator,
and she's hunting men.
There's something in her past.
Yeah, but her story rings true.
It's not neat.
Like, she didn't say that she
saw Gene kill these guys
or even that he told her he did.
She's a narcissist.
Why would she
let someone else
get credit for it?
To exonerate herself.Oh, you should've
seen her.
She is thrilled
we know she did it.
JASMINE:
So prove it.
Get me something
I can use.
A witness, a videotape.
Better still, a confession.
She really doesn't look
like the type.
That's the thing about people.
They always surprise you.
I have to say
something to you.
I'm not sure why you
missed the cage fight,
but I know it has something
to do with Katie.
Yeah, she got drunk
and puked in a cab.
I had to help her.
How?
I paid for it.
We do things for family.
I've been cleaning up
after her forever.
It's so predictable.
Maybe your perspective's
a little predictable, too.
What?When Katie handed me
those MMA tickets, it was
because she couldn't face you.
Avoidance is one
of her specialties.
Yeah, well, it must
run in the family.
If you keep rescuing someone
all the time,
you're denying them
the opportunity
to learn from
their own mistakes,
to grow up.
Is there a polite way of saying
"mind your own business"?
:
Yes.
"Please shut up."
Please shut up.No, I will not.
You owe it to her and yourself
to change the dynamic.
Stop enabling her.
Hey. Do you have any
good Mexican around here?
Villa del Sol.
:
Villa del Sol.
What's wrong?
I have to stop.
Stop?
Yeah.
And you have to stop, too.
Stop what?
The drinking.
And my letting
it happen.
No more stepping in
to make things go away.
I did it with Mom.
I'm not gonna do it with you.
Not anymore.
You have to take
responsibility.
It is so perfect
that you are a cop,
because you get to tell
everybody what they do wrong
and make everybody else
feel like a failure.
I don't do that.Really?
You can't drink
if you want to stay here.
Well, it's not quite the, uh,
date night out I was hoping for,
but I'll take it.
I'm sorry.
We're short-staffed.
I made the hostess
a waitress,
the dishwasher a busboy.
Which means I'll be
washing dishes.
Living the dream.
You know my favorite
part of the day?
It's when you come home.
You're exhausted,
but you're happy.
When you were a lawyer,
you were never happy.
Now, I know the last few
weeks have been difficult.
And, of course, there was the
landlord's little surprise.
But... this is not a sign.
Well, sign or no sign,
we could lose
our life savings
on a gamble
just because I always
wanted to own a bar.
I do not consider this
bar or you a gamble.
You're the best
investment I ever made.
Hi. I'm waitress, and I'll be
your Candice tonight.
Oh. I mean...That's all right, Candice.
Uh, Candice has never
waited tables before.
What?
Very different from
showing people to the tables.
Is that a Philadelphia
accent I hear?
Really? I've been trying
to get rid of it.
There's not too many roles
for Philly girls out there.
DYLAN: I'm hearing a slight
coastal New England accent.
Could you be from Boston?
Rhode Island
They don't have cells,
so I let them use
our phones to call home.
DYLAN: She may not
have been our problem
up till now,
but she was somebody's.
You don't just start
with savage murder.
You work up to it.
Lizzie?
We need to find
Nicki's first victim.
And I know how.
Based on Nicki's accent,
we narrowed
her home down
to New England.
The kids in the shelter use
the landline, so we went
through all the calls
to New England.We found three calls
to a boarding school
in Newport, Rhode Island.
The headmaster I.D.'d
Nicki's photo.
Real name: Amber Burnett.
The girl in the wheelchair,
who was Nicki's roommate,
is still there.
We called the Newport PD.
There's a reason
she hid her past.
It wasn't her first murder.
People have always
been jealous of Nicki.
Ella, we need to talk to you
about something serious.
Is it Brendan?
Please tell us what you know.
He's a townie.
He was Nicki's boyfriend,
but he kind of disappeared.
She told the cops
that she didn't know anything,
but they don't believe her.
That's why she ran away.
What do you think, Ella?
She really liked him.
It doesn't make sense
that she could...
Ella, the Newport Police
have found Brendan's body.
His throat was cut.
That's the same way
two men in New York
were killed last week.
A photographer
and a young man
Brendan's age, your age.Oh, my God.
Ella, I know this is moving
very, very fast, but...
we think Nicki killed Brendan
and these two men.
Will you help us?
DYLAN:
Ella's a lonely kid.
Along comes Nicki--
beautiful, exciting,
pays her attention--
and soon Ella's devoted.
That I get, but
given who Nicki is,
why befriend Ella?
Ella's her plaything.
Sociopaths will continue
a relationship
as long as they get
something from it.
Huh. Never a bad idea
to have a loyal acolyte
who will lie for you.
And tell you what
the police are asking
once you've fled
to New York.
DYLAN:
Showtime.
Okay, Ella,
just like we said.
I'm scared.
She's gonna hate me.
DYLAN:
She's sick.
Remember?
You're helping her.
Hey, Nut.
Do I know you?
Amber, it's me,
Elle's Bells.
Amber.
Is that my name?
I'm your roommate.
I'm your best friend.
Your hair looks awesome.
I didn't know it was
gonna be that blonde.
Great, Ella.
Now get into it.
So... the cops found Brendan
by the marsh.
Right where you guys
used to always meet up.
I don't know
what you're talking about.
Don't worry. I told
them that you didn't
leave the room
after dinner.
And they found
some footprints.
They asked me what kind
of sneakers you had.
Keep the story going,
but tell her
you want to go
to the restroom.
I told them that you
only wear flats.
Oh, and check this out.
Actually, first, can we
go to the restroom?
If you can't
remember Ella,
how do you know
she uses a wheelchair?
Guess I made a mistake.
Took you a while, though.
Thought I was home free
till I saw Elle's Bells.
:
She's a pathetic loser.
LIZZIE:
Let's go, Amber.
OFFICER:
Come on.
DYLAN:
Why?
Why did you kill them?
AMBER:
Why not?
They didn't give a damn
about me.
The photographer said
he'd get me modeling jobs.
And then the bastard
stole my bag.
DYLAN:
Did Gene know anything?
AMBER: He's a moron. I'd just tell him what to draw.
DYLAN:
And Caleb?
AMBER: We went to his room
to get money for dinner.
That hick had like $400
in his drawer.
DYLAN:
None of them fought back?
AMBER: We'd get busy.
Know what I'm saying?
And then after,
they'd be lying there,
eyes closed,
big smile on their face,
and I'd just...
DYLAN: We found this
in Caleb's apartment.
It's addressed to you.
He wants our blessing
to study piano.
LIZZIE:
We thought you might
like to have this.
MR. TROYER:
We can't accept it.
Oh, God would understand.
:
Oh...
That's my son.
Hi.
Hey.
48 hours is up.
He's already taking
advantage of the free booze.
We have a new silent partner?
Oh, I think he's going to be
anything but silent.
To following your dreams.
To relying on each other.
Mmm.
I'm actually here with Lizzie.
We're having dinner
to celebrate closing the case.
Yeah, I don't think
she got the memo
about the
"celebrate" part.
Hey.
So, I stopped by my house.
Katie's gone.
She packed her things.
No note.
Our mom was an alcoholic.
I spent high school
trying to stop her
from drinking herself to death
while I was looking after Katie.
Now Katie's...
I'm losing her, too.
You were right
to set boundaries.
I don't know how to help.
I haven't known you
for long, but one thing
I know for sure is that you
know how to help people.
You've even helped me.
Even you?
Mm-hmm.
Hi. Sorry.
Oh, hi. I'm just...
I was just...
Do you want to...?
Why don't you...?
Thank you.
That's my ten-month
sobriety chip.
You never... I had no idea that
you were going to meetings.
I made it to ten months
and 14 days.
Wow.
And then two weeks ago,
I got fired.
And the next day,
Trip dumped me...
...for his mother's oncologist.
The woman who cured
his mother's cancer
and bought him a BMW.
Wow, some men are
so easily swayed.
I know.
I fell off the wagon.
Really hard.
I was scared.
I just needed to see you.
Katie, I'm sorry.
I didn't know how to help. I...
You did. You did help.
I needed a kick in the butt.
That's what I came for.
That's-that's what I needed.
I mean, I was spinning out, man.
I mean, I...
I went back this morning, and...
when I go back to Boulder,
I'm gonna keep going.
I want to start over.
You make me want
to be a better person.
You always have.
