Finga,

Giorgio.
Do you have to drive
so fast, Signor Giannetti?
This is not fast, Signora.
Is it far?
No.
Ecco! Castelo D'Orsino.
What does it look like?
It's up on a hill, Beck,
just like in a fairy tale.
No, no.
Hold on, sweetie.
You'll catch cold.
You know, when I got
your letter, Mr. Giannetti,
I thought it was a scam.
A scam?
Well, it's just hard to believe
I've actually inherited a castle.
This way, Signora.
Signorina.
What's the matter, mom?
Nothing.
Just be careful where
you walk around here, okay?
This part was built 700 years ago.
Welcome to Castle Reilly, ladies.
Oh, it is cold, mama.
Have the rooms been prepared, Signor?
Of course, follow me.
I still don't understand
how John is related
to the Duchess.
I hired an investigation agency,
and we found you, Signor Reilly.
You are the son of
the late Duchess' sister,
the last D'Orsino.
Daddy, I think he's saying
that you're the Duke.
Yes, your father is
the legal heir of the title
and the castle, and
the possessions it contains.
I'm afraid the family
lost their fortune
during the war.
So there is no money.
Mr. Giannetti?
Yes?
How soon can you
liquidate the assets
of the estate?
Oh, you want to sell?
Yes, everything,
as soon as possible.
How much is the estate worth?
Oh, that is impossible to say.
No one but the duchess has
been in the castle for 40 years.
This is my sister, Agnese.
She will cook and
clean the rooms for you.
Hello, I'm John Reilly.
- This is my wife, Susan...
- Hi.
...and our daughter Rebecca.
Your room is here.
The girl is next door.
Grazie, Signora.
Your mother and you...
...are the Signora and
Signorina of the Castelo.
I'm the housekeeper.
There is much to do if
you want to sell the castle.
So, we'll need a list of
all the possessions.
An inventory?
Si, si, an inventory.
I must talk to an agent.
Thank you.
Sorry, I have to go.
Arrive derci.
- Bye bye.
- Ciao.
Thanks.
Well, are you staying
in the castle, Agnese?
Si, I've a room by the kitchen.
Could you prepare another
room for tonight?
Somebody's coming?
Well, it's for my husband.
Si, I'll make another room.
Supper is pasta and vitello?
Vitello?
Si.
Oh, well,
I'm sure that will be lovely.
Thank you very much.
You stay only a little
in the castelo?
You sell, and then you go.
Soon.
As soon as we finish
our business.
That good.
You sell and then you go.
Soon.
Who is it?
It's me.
Hi.
Hi.
What do you want?
Well, I thought since
it's the first night
in a new place, that
we could make a fresh start of it.
I was just about
to go to bed, John.
I took my pill.
Well, I could wake
you up, Sleeping Beauty.
You are in my...
- ...castle, you know.
- Don't want it.
You are so beautiful.
John, please, I can't.
I miss you, Susan.
I miss you so, so much.
Stop it!
For Christ's sake.
- It's been nine months.
- I know, I know!
I haven't touched a drop.
I know,
you've been very good...
...and I know that
I should try to forgive you,
that I should want to
forgive you, but I can't.
Then why are you here?
Why did you even come with--
She's in the next room.
I'm sorry.
I'm going to bed now.
Maybe we should pull over
until it lets up.
I told your mother that
I would pick you up...
...and I would have you
home for dinner.
We're already late.
How ya doin' back there, JJ?
Fine.
Hey! Hey, get back in your seat.
I can get it.
I said get back in your seat, JJ!
Daddy!
Becky?
JJ?
JJ!
JJ!
JJ!
No!
No!
JJ?
JJ?
Ah, God.
Do you need help?
No, thank you,
I just cut myself.
In the middle of the night?
Well, I was looking for
the bathroom and I fell.
Did something wake you?
Why, did something wake you?
Old people sleep only a little.
You heard it too, didn't you?
Heard what?
Moaning.
Like a child crying?
My brother, he did not tell you...
...the story?
No, thank you.
I don't drink.
What story?
The Duchess had a son, Giorgio.
Le bambino bello.
A beautiful child.
Well, why didn't
he inherit all this?
He died when he was
only five years old.
Five?
How did he die?
No one knows.
The husband of the Duchess.
She married an American
after the war.
He abandoned her
and his little boy.
Soon after that,
Giorgio was buried.
Then, the Duchess dismissed
everybody and lived alone.
She never left the castle,
for 42 years until she died.
Losing a child is
the worst grief there is.
And the worst guilt.
When her American left her,
the Duchess went pazzo.
Crazy.
Some in town,
they say she took revenge
and killed his son.
Jesus, it was her son, too.
Yes, it's against nature,
against God.
Why are you telling me this?
Some in town, they also say
that late at night,
when the streets are quiet,
you can hear Giorgio crying.
A child crying.
They say the castle is haunted.
Il libro è verde.
The book is green.
Il libro è verde.
Il libro è verde.
Il lago è azzurro.
The lake is blue.
Il lago è azzurro.
Il lago è azzurro.
Il fiore è rosso.
The flower is red.
Il fiore è rosso.
Sweetie, are you okay?
What's wrong?
I'm fine, really.
What kind of flowers are those?
Oh, I'm not sure, really.
I got them outside
around the castle.
Hello, ladies.
I'm going to start
making an inventory
of what we got here.
The booty.
You want to tag along, Beck?
Get the lay of the land?
Sure!
Well, I'm not sure
that's a good idea.
We'll stay on this floor.
Come on, Beck, let's go.
Here, be careful, okay?
Stop worrying so much,
mom, we'll be fine.
Oh.
What?
It's a room full of toys, Beck.
It's a nursery, I think.
Here, Beck.
What?
What's that?
A horse.
A rocking horse.
Right.
Oh, wow!
What?
Let's set you down on this bed.
Right there.
While I look around for booty.
Oh, it looked like somebody
lived in this room.
Now, if you were a Duchess,
where would you hide your jewellery?
I don't know.
Under the bed?
Why not?
Worth a try.
Daddy!
Is it there?
No, sweetheart.
It's not there.
Just some junk.
Oh.
We keep looking.
Okay.
Daddy?
Do you hear anything like,
scratching?
No.
Daddy?
Beck, just a second, please.
I'm looking at a few things.
Nice kitty.
Where are you?
Kitty?
Where are you going?
What do you want?
Where are you going,
you crazy cat?
Beck?
Beck?
Rebecca?
This is silly.
Let's go back upstairs.
Wait!
What the heck is down here
that's so important?
Oh, damn.
Oh, get out of here.
Go wherever you're going!
Jeez-louise.
Out of here.
Hello?
Oh.
Hello?
Is anybody there?
Is that just you, you stupid cat?
Anybody there?
Come here.
Here, kitty!
Come out of there, kitty.
Come here, kitty.
Rebecca?
Daddy?
Rebecca?
Kitty, come on, I gotta go.
Rebecca!
Down here, Daddy!
Daddy?
Daddy, I'm coming.
Daddy?
Daddy!
Daddy?
Rebecca, where have you been?
I heard your father calling for you!
Why aren't you with him?
There's somebody else here!
What?
What are you talking about?
What happened?
There was a door
and I opened it,
and I followed
this cat downstairs.
Downstairs?
Becky, how could you be so stupid?
You could have been hurt!
Well, I kinda, you know --
Oh no, You are hurt.
It's just a cut.
- It's really no big deal.
- There you are!
God, Beck, where were you?
She's hurt, John,
because you let her run off.
Beck, what did you do?
She was right with me.
Yeah, what's your excuse
this time?
We can't watch her every minute.
Well, you can't,
obviously, can you?
Listen, listen,
there's somebody in the castle!
Rebecca, you have to promise me
that you won't do
anything like that again.
You mean walk around
like a normal person?
Look, if you want
to explore the castle
or the town, then all
you have to do is tell me,
and I'll go with you.
Mom, it's, it's my handicap.
It's my challenge.
I have to deal with it myself.
I know you do, sweetie.
I know you do, I'm sorry.
You don't have any friends
here, and you're--
A friend would believe me, Mom.
You've got to listen to me.
There's somebody else in the castle.
Enough of this, okay?
Come on, put your glasses on.
Let's go to lunch.
Now sweetie,
I want you to know that
I am your friend,
and I'll always be your friend.
And I'll always take care of you.
And I think you're just projecting,
because you want to have
somebody else here with you.
Is there a cat in the house, Agnese?
No.
But Gabriella, she loved cats.
Gabriella, was that the Duchess?
Si.
Oh, did you know her?
Si, I was the maid in the castle
when she was a young girl.
Oh, what was she like?
She always got what she wanted.
If she did not...
Was she pretty?
She was beautiful.
Bella!
What?
Like you.
Oh, you must eat, you are too thin.
Oh, tell her, Agnese.
She eats like a bird.
Americans don't eat enough.
To share food makes a family.
No?
My god, this mirror broke!
Oh, that's all we need.
Seven more years of bad luck.
No, no, no, no.
The wood warped.
These things are so old, or,
maybe there was a sudden
change of temperature.
Or somebody else
is in the castle.
Who's there?
Who are you?
I know you're there.
Sweetheart, what is it?
What is it, who is here?
Sweetie, what's the matter?
You having a dream?
No, it's okay, it's okay.
I believe you.
I'm going to go look around.
No, daddy, please be careful!
It's okay.
- It's okay, sweetie.
- It's all right, sweetheart.
I'll be right back.
It's okay, it's okay, sweetie.
It's okay, I'm here.
It's okay.
JJ?
JJ.
My baby boy.
So, your daughter heard
something in her room last night,
and she sensed something
downstairs before that.
Is that correct?
Yes.
But you found no one on this floor
or below, when you went to look.
No, but I heard crying.
Did you hear crying, Signora Reilly?
Well, no, I didn't.
What?
What did he say?
He says, so the door are locked
and this is not evidence
of entering by force.
No one has come to the castle
from the outside.
But you won't know that for certain
until you search the place, right?
Castle D'Orsino has
more than 150 rooms.
We cannot spare the men to search
with such little evidence.
Well, my daughter said that
she did hear something.
I'm certain she did.
A castle makes many sounds,
especially at night.
Everybody thinks I made it up.
No, I think maybe you didn't understand.
No, I think maybe you don't understand.
We want you to search the castle!
What about--
What about this mirror?
How did you hurt
your hand, Signor Reilly?
What are you saying?
Are you saying I did it myself?
Why would I break my own mirror?
Maybe you don't like what you saw.
Susan?
John!
She didn't get much
sleep last night, you know.
None of us did, come on.
I want to show you something.
Why, what is it?
Please, you've got to see this.
Come on.
It's in here, Susan.
That's really weird.
It's gone.
There was a picture right there,
of a little boy who looked like JJ.
John.
No, I swear.
He looked exactly like JJ.
It was right there.
It was Giorgio.
The Duchess' son.
Look at this, Susan.
He died when he was five.
John, stop it.
This isn't funny.
You know, when I found
this place last night
and this picture, I felt--
I felt like it was JJ.
What are you talking about?
I felt like JJ was here.
Well, I feel him...
- ...sometimes, too.
- No, no, no.
It's different than that.
He was here.
John.
I know, that's why I wanted
the police to look around,
so they could find something.
He's dead.
JJ's dead.
I know.
Stop it,
you're acting like a child.
Jesus, I know he's dead,
I was there.
But listen to me.
His spirit, his ghost,
was here, Susan.
Now, Agnese says that
this castle is haunt--
No, it's your conscience, John.
You are just in such serious denial,
you don't even realize it.
No, no, no, no.
This is different.
No, it's always the same.
It's never your fault.
Your father was responsible
for your drinking problem.
The university fired you...
...because you were
politically incorrect.
And now you're trying
to use JJ's death--
No, I'm not!
Yes, you are!
It's not JJ's ghost,
it's you, John.
It's you!
You were the one who was
driving that car, drunk!
You blinded Becky!
You killed our son!
So what's left?
You just punishing me?
Yes, because God didn't.
He just let you walk
away without a scratch.
Well, what do you want me to do?
I wish I could go back.
I wish it had been me.
Oh, so do I.
The international language, huh?
No, I'm sorry.
I don't smoke.
Sorry.
But, can I buy you a drink?
Can I buy you a drink?
Joe.
Give the lady whatever she wants.
You heard it.
Joe, give me another one.
What?
What, are you tryin'--
Oh, shit.
Oh, God.
I'm sorry, Joe.
I'm sorry.
He's trying to tell you that
he's closing the bar.
Really?
You mean he's closing it to me.
You go home to your family.
Okay, okay, hold.
Listen up, I get it.
I'm going.
I've caused enough trouble
as it is.
This is for your trouble, Joe.
Hey.
Oh, and that's for her,
whatever she wants.
What?
I owe you a glass of wine,
don't I?
I know where this nice quiet place,
that's open all night.
Excellent.
Chateau Reilly.
Yes.
Quiet.
Sound travels in this place.
We don't want to be disturbed,
right?
Okay?
Please.
You have to go.
I'm sorry.
No.
No, really, you were wonderful.
I just...
I have to go.
What?
What?
Centomila.
Of course.
Of course.
Here.
Well, just fucking take it.
No, take it please.
Just take it!
Oh!
Officer.
I came to see you,
Signor Reilly.
Alone, please.
Well, you'll see me, too.
What do you want?
We need your help
to find Sylvana Lucci.
Who?
She didn't come home
last night.
Well, I don't know
anything about this.
The last time anyone saw her,
she was going into the castle with you.
Well, she's not here, officer.
And no one here has seen
her since last night?
I said she's not here.
Do you mind if I look inside?
Yesterday, you couldn't be bothered
and now you want to look around.
Yesterday, you asked us to
look and now you refuse?
Why shouldn't he look around, John?
Because he just wants to
hassle me, that's why.
Sylvana Lucci has a small child.
So you see, a mother is missing.
Am I suspect?
Has there been a crime?
No, so there's no need for you
to look around, is there?
Then you won't mind
coming to the station
to answer some questions?
I'm not going to
answer any questions...
...until I talk to my lawyer.
You brought a woman here?
I was lonely.
You were drunk.
Sus...
You are not listening to me.
I am listening to you,
I just don't agree with you.
Mom, if he's drinking again,
he'll need us more than ever.
I am tired, Becky.
I am just so tired, I--
I think if we stay together,
one of us will go crazy.
If what you tell me, Giovanni,
is all that happened,
there is no evidence against you.
It is all that happened.
Then they will find
Sylvana Lucci...
or they will find some explanation...
and you'll be innocent.
You know of course,
that the Signorina
and carabinieri were lovers.
What?
She's a prostitute.
She must have screwed
half the guys in this town.
Myself included.
But all the other men did not
have a child with her.
She had his kid?
Yes.
He denies it,
but everyone knows it's his.
He's a charming little boy.
Il telefono.
Don't worry, there is no evidence.
Excuse me.
Don't worry.
That was my sister calling
from the castle.
She has found Sylvana Lucci's
what do you call...
Handbag.
She must have left it.
That's not something a woman leaves.
I'm afraid now, they,
they're going to arrest you.
What?
That's ridiculous.
I didn't do anything.
Yes, but the police
find the handbag.
Oh, Jesus.
What are we going to do?
I'm your lawyer.
I believe you, but that is not evidence.
And then, carabinieri,
they don't need to be told.
I swear,
I didn't do anything to her.
Then we agree.
I'll have Agnese
bring me the handbag.
I'll keep it until they
find Signora Lucci.
Then, all we'll have to discuss,
is our new financial agreement.
What are you talking about?
Because of new problems
with your case,
I must raise my fee.
That's blackmail.
You bastard.
I think it's time
you learned the truth.
What?
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about
your father's first wife.
It was a great scandal.
The Duchess D'Orsino
married an American soldier.
What? What are you--
The Duchess?
Yes, they got married.
Then they had a child.
Then your father got
tired of both of them,
and he ran off with
her younger sister to America.
No, my parents never said
anything about this.
Why would they?
The Duchess would never
give him a divorce.
She's nobility.
So, the marriage of
your father with her sister
was not legal, no good.
No!
Yes.
Your father was never married
to your mother.
So, you, Giovanni, are the bastard.
Thank you.
Get in the car, Rebecca.
Susan!
I have to say goodbye.
No, get in the car.
Susan.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
We're leaving, John.
No, listen.
Listen, they're going to arrest me.
For what?
That woman is still missing.
I need your help.
You brought a whore
into our home, John.
Into our home, with Becky there.
Look, I know that
but if you leave me,
it's going to look like I'm guilty.
I should have left you
two years ago.
Susan, please!
I'm begging you.
You made yourself into
a whipping boy, John.
Don't blame me.
Go.
Whipping boy?
Whipping boy.
Why would she have a whip?
Susan!
I think I know what happened,
what's happening.
And I can prove it!
Bye Daddy!
I'll see you again
sweetheart, I promise!
Yes?
I'm sorry, Signora Reilly
but we must take your husband
to the Carabinieri station
to answer some questions.
Oh, well, I'm sure he'll
be able to explain himself.
We must also search the castle.
Fine, do whatever you have to do.
My daughter and I are catching
the train to Rome.
I must ask you both
to stay in Orsino.
We will require statements from you.
But we don't know
anything about any of this.
But you understand that we must ask.
And first we have to talk to your husband.
We are grateful for your cooperation.
Well, don't be.
You're keeping us here
against our will.
Where is Agnese?
I don't know, really.
We wanted to say goodbye,
but we couldn't find her.
Where are the stairs, please?
Somebody needs to stay with my daughter.
He's a policeman honey,
he'll stay with you, okay.
It's alright.
Grimaldi.
What's going on mom?
John.
What are you doing?
Rebecca is right.
There is someone else in the castle.
God, forgive you.
It is nothing but rocks.
He's not here.
Who, Signor.
Giorgio D'Orsino, he was never buried.
She kept him alive.
He's alive.
Don't you see?
He's here.
He's here somewhere in the castle.
Where is my sister?
I don't know where your sister is.
Maybe he took her.
Come with us, Signora Reilley.
What?
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
No, no, no, no.
Listen to me.
Wait a minute.
Check upstairs,
in the Duchess's room.
She has a whip.
Why would she have a whip?
Who's she going to use it on?
Think, for Christ's sake.
She never let anyone in, right?
But who was here to begin
with, at the start?
Her son, he didn't die.
She had him hid away.
She made him into a whipping boy
to get back at my father
for leaving her.
Very clever.
He's the one that broke the mirror.
He's the one that was in
Rebecca's room, I'm telling you.
You've got to search the castle.
Oh my God.
You are under arrest.
What?
I didn't do this.
Why would I do this?
You should be careful what you say,
until you talk to your lawyer.
Susan, I didn't do this.
I swear, I need your help.
Please, I know it.
I need your help, I'm innocent.
I didn't do it!
Please, go back.
Yes?
Grimaldi and Benedetti will
stay here tonight.
You can bring your daughter
to the station tomorrow,
and give your testimony.
Alright, thank you.
You alright?
Okay.
Buona notte.
Goodnight.
Could you get us some water?
Acqua, per favore.
Acqua, si.
Can you get someone
in here who speaks English?
English!
Damn it!
It's okay.
Officer.
Officer, would you please listen to me.
Then you are prepared to
answer some questions.
I will answer any
questions that you want,
but you have got to get
my family out of that castle.
Why?
Why, because there
is a madman in there
and my family is in danger.
And who is this madman,
Giorgio D'Orsino?
You saw the coffin.
You saw that it was empty.
Why would the Duchess
bury an empty coffin?
That was 40 years ago.
I want more about last night.
Why did you kill Sylvana?
I keep telling you over,
and over, and over again.
I didn't kill her!
It was him!
No more fairy tales.
Tell me the truth.
Hello!
Yes.
We asked for water.
Acqua, do you know if it's coming?
Yes, acqua, acqua.
I go, I go.
Thank you.
Benedetti!
It's coming, Sweetie.
Benedetti!
Bene...
We're going to get
through this, sweetie.
You'll see.
We're going to be home, soon.
Do you really think
daddy's a murderer?
You do.
You think he killed JJ.
I thought you guys must
love JJ more than me.
What, why would you say that?
Because you hate each other
so much, since he died.
Oh, sweetie.
We both love you so much,
you know that, don't you?
I know.
And no matter what,
your father needs our prayers.
So pray with me, okay.
Heavenly father, please watch over us,
and protect us in
this time of trouble.
And help my mother
forgive my father.
And God, please help us
put our family back together.
- Amen.
- Amen.
We'll figure out what
to do in the morning, okay.
I think I'm getting one
of my headaches.
Okay, I have your pills right here.
I just thought that
we'd never get back to normal.
Where's that water?
Mom, are you listening to me?
Yes sweetie, I'm listening.
I don't care that things
won't be normal again.
Normal sucks.
Becky.
No, really.
Well, I don't have to worry
about all that stupid stuff,
like cars and prom and stuff.
When I get a boyfriend,
automatically be a special person
because he won't care
that I'm blind.
And I'll have to judge him by
what he's really like
not by what he looks like.
It'll have to be love,
the real thing.
Mom?
It's you!
Help!
Please.
Please, I have answered all
of your questions.
And now I want you
to get my daughter
and my wife out of that castle, now.
You don't give orders here.
and you will answer questions until
we are satisfied with your answers.
Now, tell me again,
why did you kill Sylvana?
I didn't kill her,
I fucked her, okay.
No!
Why are you doing this to me?
What do you want?
Please, let me go.
Please.
The police are here.
They'll find you, they will.
No, no!
Stop!
Mom!
Let her go.
Let her go!
Take me.
No, mom, no!
Come on, take me.
Take me!
Run, mom, run!
Get up, get up, come on!
Oh no.
Mom, look at him, he's coming.
Giorgio!
John!
Daddy!
John.
John!
Daddy!
John.
John.
Forgive me.
I'm sorry.
John, I love you.
