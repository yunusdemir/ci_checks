- Good hustle.
- Yeah.
- Whoo!
- Whoo!
All right, so I'm at dinner
with this girl,
okay, and we're deciding
what to get,
and she asks me
if I like fettuccini Alfredo.
- You hate fettuccini Alfredo.
- Of course I do.
It's like macaroni and
cheese's rich, snobby cousin.
Well, I met this hot public
defender playing tennis.
I'm a doctor;
He's a lawyer.
- I'm just saying, sounds fancy.
- No.
See, I don't trust
tennis people.
What's with
all the grunting?
Okay, you almost done with your
hilarious tennis stand-up?
I'm done.
So, we start flirting...
So, what really happens
during a sidebar?
Do you talk about
legal issues,
or do you vote on
who's the cutest juror?
Actually, we, uh, say the word
"bailiff" over and over again
until we all
start to giggle.
Oh, uh, Sara,
this is my doubles
partner, Tasi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I was just about to ask Sara
to dinner tomorrow night.
Oh. Sara would love to.
Perfect. Actually, if you have a
friend for Tasi, we could double.
Can I be the friend
for hot Tasi?
I was thinking that,
but then I remembered
that you don't like
tennis people.
No, I think tennis
people are great.
Sometimes I just say
things that...
Well, wouldn't
it be weird
if we went on a double date?
- Why?
- Uh, because
- Lucas and Tasi don't know about this.
- Sara, they don't
need to know everything
about us right off the bat.
Do they need to know
about my trick ankle?
Do they need to know
about your shoplifting?
- It's just candy, and it's
not every day.   - Right.
Anyway, we're not
just about this, you know.
We're friends, too.
Well... friends
go on double dates.
- Yeah.
- I'll set it up.
Yes! How about one
for the road
in case these tennis bastards
don't put out?
Huh? I'm making
sheet angels!
Man, I hope I like this guy.

Come on...
Yes! Ha-ha! Hey-yo!
Isn't it gonna be
a little awkward
with you guys
going on a double date?
Why would that
be awkward?
Because... because
Ben and Sara are both...
- Capricorns.
- No, they're not.
- She's a Gemini; He's a
classic Aquarius.   - Yeah.
Oh, by the way, Ben,
disturbing news may arrive
from an unexpected
source today.
Okay, I will prepare myself
for that. Thank you.
Hey, we should go.
- Yeah.
- And I need you guys for a sec.
I have to give Ben
some disturbing news.
From me— that's
unexpected, right?
Hey, guys, sorry
that I forgot Fitz didn't know
you were hooking up.
- Yeah.   - <i>Why</i> doesn't Fitz
know that you guys are hooking up?
We waited too long
to tell him, you know?
So if we tell him now, he'll
think it's like... like a thing.
- Which it so isn't.
- Yeah.
So to not make a big deal
out of this,
you're making a big deal
out of keeping
one of your best friends
in the dark.
- Yeah.
- Exactly.
Well, thank you for dragging
me into your drama.
'Cause this is
very pleasant for me.
- Yeah, no problem. 'Kay.
- You're welcome.
Hey, Ri, can I get a daiquiri?
Ordering daiquiris not only
creates a ton of work for me,
it makes you seem
very, very feminine.
- Wow, harsh.   - Wait, maybe I'm not
doing it right. Okay, let me explain.
Last night I went to a gallery
with Clay, this guy I'm seeing.
<i>We were having
a great time, and then...</i>
Hi. I'm Packard,
the artist.
Oh, cool photos.
Let me tell you
my process.
First, I listen to the
soundtrack of<i> The Graduate,</i>
and then I write down all
the feelings that I feel...
Boring. Bored.
I'm bored.
- Bored. He said that?
- I know.
But then he explained.
Our society is built on lies.
Question: What would happen
if we all said
exactly what we were thinking
when we were thinking it?
Answer: We'd make deeper
connections with each other.
Summation: That's how I live.
I call it "Full Disclosure."
That's the dumbest
thing I've ever heard.
That's what<i> I</i> thought.
Then I tried it.
Bored.
Less bored.
Least bored I've ever been!
- I got to meet this man.  - Well, Clay and
I are going to a movie after my shift.
You guys can meet him then.
The man behind the method.
You guys, lies
are very important
to our society, okay?
- Since the dawn of time...
- Bored.
Bored.
So, you went to med school
right out of college?
Yeah. But I'm not
career-obsessed or anything.
I did travel
that summer,
to my aunt's house
in New Jersey.
I had a curfew,
but I snuck out once.
Smoked a menthol under the boardwalk.
Whatever. Ooh.
The point is,
I like to party.
Drinking!
Drinking!
Drinking. Yeah!
Hey, you guys,
watch this.
This is an
imitation of me
when I'm not on a date.
Oh, my goodness.
Awesome!
- Oh, my God!
- Awesome!
- Yeah!
- Wow.
That was too funny.
That was too funny.
- Oh, thank you.
- Nice!
Looks like we
need more drinks.
- Yes!
- Next round's on us.
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay.
Thank you.
- Be right back.
- Thanks, guys.
Am I crazy, or are we knocking
this date out of the park?
Tasi loves you.
Uh, Lucas loves you.
We're like the
detectives from SVU,
but instead of
solving sex crimes,
we have delightful
dinners with people.
Correction: People have
delightful dinners with<i> us.</i>
Oh!
Yeah!
Full disclosure—
That movie was kind of...
No, you don't say
"full disclosure,"
you just say
what you think.
Oh. Well, that movie was
not my favorite cup of tea.
Your adding the
word "favorite"
to the expression
"cup of tea"
makes you momentarily
ridiculous.
Zing! Clay got me.
Hey, I love this guy.
I have to go
to the bathroom.
Not to pee,
just to look at myself.
I thought that
movie sucked.
You can't have a crappy plot
and then just throw
Don Cheadle at the problem.
- Bored.
- Man, you have bored'd me
about ten times today! Okay?
I think you have attention
deficit hyperactivity...
Bored listening
to you say
each word of
a well-known acronym.
You know what, Clay?
You ought to write a
book on full disclosure.
I train one of
the higher-ups
at Harper Collins.
I could pass it along
for you, man.
I'm bemused and offended
that a gym trainer
whose name rhymes
with "spritz"
thinks he can help me
with my life's work.
Proud of my appearance.
Leaving in a huff.
Going with you.
I'm a little tipsy.
I'm gonna get myself
out of here.
I will walk you out.

Bit of a party foul earlier,

Smax, hey.
Just saw a clip

Call me when your date's over

Interesting it went to voice
mail after one and a half rings.
So either you're on the phone
with someone else,
or you red-buttoned me—
Either way, not loving it.
You talking to me?
Are you talking to<i> me?</i>
You're telling me that our dates
are going equally as well,
and you hook up with yours

Go away.
I'm mad at you.
I know— I listened
to your messages.
I brought you a peace coffee.
I put in lots
of chocolate
so it gets all clumpy
like you like it.
I don't want
your stupid coffee.
What's wrong with you?
I thought the whole point of this
was that we could see other people.
And now you're jealous?
What? I'm not
jealous, crazy.
Hey, we're also friends.
What you did last night
was bad friend etiquette.
What?
There's a bro-ho hierarchy,
and you've prioritized
the ho over the bro.
Are you calling me a ho?
No, no, no.
In this scenario, Lucas would
be the ho and you'd be the bro.
I'm a bro?
I love that.
- I bet I'm the prettiest bro.
- Aw,
get over yourself— you've
been a terrible bro so far.
You know what? When my date
fell apart last night,
you should've
pulled out of yours.
Wait. I am supposed to bail
on a potentially awesome guy
because you had no game.
Hey, I'm not happy about it either,
but that's the way it works.
- And that's what bro's do?
- That's what bro's do.
Wow. Well, if that's
the case, I feel terrible.
Well, that's because your conscience is
telling you that you've been horrible.
You know what?
I was supposed to go out
with Lucas tonight,
but I'm rain-checking that ho
and I'm hanging with my bro.
Come over. I'll be

Okay. Rough pun,
but... thank you.
It's all good, bro.
Should we chest-bump now?
I see no reason why not.
Ow! Yeah.
Ow!
- Damn.
- That's why not.
Man, that Clay is a tool.
What does she see in him?
Trying to understand why women do certain
things is like trying to understand
why certain powders turn into
Jell-O when you add hot water.
It's better left a delicious mystery.
It's 'cause
the hot water separates
the molecules... Aaron,
I said it's better left
a delicious mystery.
She deserves to be
with somebody great.
Oh! Somebody like you?
I have come to terms
with the fact
that Riley and I

Just because we shared
one night of fiery

carefree but meaningful,
reckless yet protected...
Hey, hey,
I get it. Could we just
<i>tell</i> her that he's awful?
No, we can't tell her
that he's bad news, man.
If we do that, it'll only
make her like him more.
It's too bad Clay doesn't
full-disclosure Riley
the way he full-disclosures
everybody else.
Man, she'd kick him
to the curb in no time.
That's it.
We got to get him

You are with Tasi!
What happened
to all your stupid bro crap?!
We're talking about
different rules here, okay?
You left me hanging
on a double date,
but I flaked
on a casual hang-out.
You know? It doesn't
have the same weight.
It's very nuanced.
"Nuanced," my ass.
You're just making up different
rules for each situation.
I remember
when I was first learning.
It's very frustrating.
I get it.
Okay, I have only been a bro
for, like, one day,
but I'm pretty sure
that you're full of crap.
So, you know what?
You know what?
You can bro to hell!
Okay, I think we should use
subtle reverse psychology to...
You need to break
up with Clay.
Why? I like him.
He's a radical thinker.
He's a radical douche.
And I guarantee you,
he's not telling you
everything that he thinks.
Mm-mm. If he used his
philosophy to insult you
the way he does us...
I would be fine with it,
because I'm fine
with who I am.
Oh, please, Riley.
Come on.
If I told you the truth,
you would crumble
like that cake
from that place I like.
That place on...
You don't know it!
Okay. There's one way
to settle this.
I challenge you
to a truth-off.
Or Riley breaks up with Clay,
and we all go back to a
normal, good, regular life.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
What's a "truth off"?
We drop truth bombs
on each other
until one person can't take
any more brutal honesty
and surrenders.
Aaron can mediate.
No, no,
I'm not gonna mediate.
I mediated
when my parents would fight,
and now I pee sitting down.
Really?
That was the best episode of
<i>Nurse Jackie</i> I have ever seen.
This show is so good.
I'm going to
go freshen up.
Okay.
Ooh...
What...
You know, I'm not
feeling so good.
I think I
may take off.
-  Okay.
- Yeah.
I'll text ya.
Go away. I hate you.
I know. I know.
But we can't fight right now.
We got bigger fish to fry.
What could be
bigger fish
than your selfish
fish... fish?
Was that
the right number of fishes?
You, uh, you a little drunk?
No.
The cork in my stomach
is absorbing it.
I just found out Lucas
and Tasi are hooking up.
I don't want to
hear your lame ex...
- What?
- Yeah.
They're friends
and they're sleeping together,
and then they go out with other
people just to mock them.
- That is disgusting.
- I know.
Check it out.
I took a picture
of Tasi's phone.
Let me see that.
Yeah.
<i>Haven't heard from gyno wino.</i>
<i>Well, at least
I won't have to listen</i>
<i>to her long-winded stories.</i>
<i>Uh, her d-bag
buddy's no picnic either.</i>
<i>Could you believe the way
he ate off everyone's plate</i>
<i>like a London hobo?</i>
<i>We should totally
double date again</i>
<i>just to get ammo

They don't like my stories?
And they didn't like my
devil-may-care eating style?
Look, now,
I know you're mad,
but we got
to put that aside, okay?
It's like when aliens attack,
then suddenly America's
friends with the Russians.
When were we not friends
with the Russians?
I don't know. My dad
always goes on about that.
All right, you're
not off the hook.
- Mm-mmm.
- But you're right.
- This is bigger fish.
- Yeah.
We need to date these
guys, delight them...
- Ooh.
- And then dump them.
These hos messed
with the wrong bros.
I love it.
Did you at least
like my banner?
Yeah. I like it,
with the little...
little beer cup
and little ball.
It's cool.
Okay. Round one.
Fitz, drop your truth bomb.
Riley, you know how
you wear that shirt
with the big armholes,
and you always ask us,
"Guys, can you see my
nipples?" and we say, "No"?
Yeah?
We can see your nipples.
I knew that.
Okay. Good. Great.
Riley, drop your t-bomb.
Okay.
Sometimes I go
to the gym on Wednesdays
because Grant teaches a better
kickboxing class than you.
Grant just has

Grant... is... better.
Wow, guys. This is fun.
Okay, who wants

Can we do this?
Can we hook them?
Oh, they're like

Now remember, short
stories with a point,

- Hi.
- Hi.
And then I delivered

- Wow. That's a really good story.
- Thank you.
Oh, hey, Ben, do you want
to try some of my hummus?
You know what?
You ordered it.
You enjoy it.
Truth bomb.
Riley, you can't sing,
and everybody knows it.
Okay, truth bomb.
Both your moms have hit on me.
Unsuccessfully.
Your moms have no game.
Enough!
Okay. Riley, enough.
Don't you get it?
If everybody went around,
saying everything that they
wanted to all the time,
then everyone normal
would be crying all the time.
Don't you think that
I have things that I want
to say, but I don't?
Of course I do!
Sometimes I wish
you guys were all
just a-a little bit smarter.
And sometimes
I want to ask Ben and Sara
questions about all the sex
that they're having,
but I don't do that!
Because I have discretion!
What did you just say
about Ben and Sara?
I-I said, I want
to ask Ben and Sara questions
about what it's like
to be Capricorns.
Wait. Ben and Sara
are hooking up?
Did you know
about this?
Unbelievable.
Where are they now?
They're on a double date
at Hammock.
Man, come on. You know
how awkward it would be
for them to be on
a double date together?
All right.
Cool.
If they want awkward,
they're going
to get awkward.
Has this whole thing left
you feeling kind of...
- sexual?
- No.
No. Or me.
Sara, I have
to admit...
You are really cool.
I would really like
if we could...
Maybe we could see
where this could go.
You two are having sex?
- Whoa.
- How could you not tell me?
I mean, no.
Me, Fitz!
You know, every day,
I listen to you guys whine
about your petty problems.
"Oh, oh, do you think
that he didn't call me back
because I didn't shave my legs
all the way up?"
Uh, yes.
"Do you think
my date was pissed
because I, you know,
tried to make my own condom?"
Dude! No! I've never...
I have listened
to you guys
drone on about every single
text message you receive,
and now that you two
are hooking up,

- Guys, listen.

Oh, good, go.
