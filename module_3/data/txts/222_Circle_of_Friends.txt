When all this started...
our families had lived in Knockglen
for as long as anybody could remember...
and in lreland...
people have very long memories.
Till shortly before l was born,
the country was ruled for 1,000 years...
by heathen invaders...
as the nuns called them.
We'd survived the Vikings
and the Normans...
and even the English.
lt was faith in the Church,
we were told...
that gave Knockglen
its strength to survive...
and after all that surviving,
the whole village was there...
when my two best friends and l
were having our confirmation day.
There was Eve...
and me, Benny...
and Nan.
We were inseparable, the three of us.
Nan Mahon was beautiful...
and because of it, she never doubted
that anything she wanted would be hers.
There was me, of course:
Benny-- Bernadette Hogan...
the apple of my parents' eyes...
an only child, but my mother fed me
as though l were two.
- That's my little princess.
- My mother.
Don't they look just gorgeous?
And there was Eve Malone.
Daddy, can Eve be in it?
- l'm sure she can.
- ls that all right, Sisters?
Eve was an orphan,
raised by the nuns...
but you know,
that only made her special.
Big smiles all around again.
Beautiful.
That was the day Eve took us
to the cottage her father had left her.
He'd been a gardener
for the Westwards...
the Protestant family
that owned the big house on the hill.
Old Mr. Westward
never went out anymore...
but on our way to the cottage,
we saw his son, Simon...
riding his horse
and looking grand...
as usual.
ls it really your very own?
The nuns are keeping it for me.
When l'm 18, l'm going to live in it.
- Are you?
- You can live in it, too, if you like.
We're moving to Dublin, me dad says.
Well, you can live with me, Benny.
l don't think me ma and da
would let me.
When you're 18,
you can do anything you like.
Good morning, ladies.
Come on, faster.
Wait!
Years later...
by the time Eve and l graduated
from the local convent school...
Nan was long gone to Dublin...
so there was only me to walk my friend
up the long path to the Westwards'...
to attend to some important business
she had there.
Do you want me to come in with you?
Who is she?
Eve Malone,
the girl the nuns brought up.
The gardener's child.
We're paying for her education.
l've got seven subjects
in the leaf insert, two with honors.
The fees are 65 pounds a year
for four years.
l got it.
65 pounds a year.
Well done!
Come on, slowcoach.
- We're going to be college students.
- l know we are. lsn't it great?
- Hello, Mrs. Healy.
- A fine day, girls.
l know, l know.
Hello, Mr. Flood.
Oh, God, there's my da
with the creepy Sean Walsh.
- Hello, girls.
- Hello, Dad.
l was just after telling your father...
"We won't be letting go of her.
She won't be led astray in the big city
like some."
Won't you be back on the ten-past-6:00
every night?
- We're going to miss the bus. Bye.
- Yes, bye.
The ten-past-6:00 bus every night!
They'd only let me go
if l carried on living at home.
How can l tell people l have to go home
every night as if l were a simpleton?
At least you don't have to live
in a convent.
Do you think l like going from a convent
in Knockglen to one in Dublin?
We'll find ways round it.
We'll knock them dead.
Oh, will we?
l'd have recognized you anywhere.
You haven't changed a bit.
My God, haven't we?
l'm going home now then.
You look gorgeous altogether.
You first-years as well?
- First day.
- And me, as a student.
l've been here for socials and hops.
The Dublin sophisticate.
You'll have to show us the ropes.
lt's lovely to see you again.
Three girls from Knockglen.
Hello, Jack.
Looking very lovely, as always.
Thank you. So are you.
You're very kind.
You're very welcome.
- Are you coming to the match today?
- We might.
Well, see you there if you do.
Who is he?
Him? Jack Foley,
the blue-eyed boy.
He played for lreland schools.
Father's a doctor.
Did you like the look of him?
lt says here, " lnaugural lecture,
main theater, Professor Flynn."
Where's that?
This foundation course
for first-year students...
used to be known as " Baby Latin."
"Baby Latin," you see.
Like baby food.
This year...
to broaden our frame of reference...
l propose to take a glance
at some other societies--
principally that of the Trobriand
lslanders of the South Pacific...
as described
in Bronislaw Malinowski's great work...
of anthropology:
"The Sexual Life of Savages."
By studying...
the rites of passage--
Come on!
Come on!
- Oh, no!
- He'll be grand.
Okay, come on, Dublin.
- Well done. You were great.
- Not so clever just then.
- Are you all right?
- l'm fine, thanks. Solid wood.
- Come on, lads.
- Do you think you might introduce us?
All right then.
Jack Foley, Bernadette Hogan.
And Eve Malone.
Delighted to meet you.
We're going to Murphy's Pub
on the quays after. Will you come?
About 7:00.
Love to.
l can't.
l have to get
the ten-past-6:00 bus home.
Well, another time then.
See you.
10, 20...
30, 40...
42 pounds.
42 pounds a month?
You shut your hole,
or l'll shut it for you.
Nobody's going to say
that Brian Mahon's not generous.
- No?
- Thank you, Daddy.
That's more than generous. l hope
you think you've made a good investment.
l'll make you proud of me...
and proud of yourself
for putting me through college.
You won't regret it. l promise.
You're a good girl.
Thank you.
Thank you. That's stupendous.
Did you have a good day?
Had a great day.
l went to a lecture and a rugby match.
What did she say?
She went to a lecture
and a rugby match.
That's nice.
ln contrast
to many other human communities...
which segregates the sexes
during adolescence...
the Trobriand lslanders allow...
their boys and girls
complete freedom...
of access to each other...
from puberty...
through to adulthood.
Malinowski found them to be...
a very happy and contented people.
Bernadette, will you hurry up?
The double entry system
is your only man.
Believe me, Mr. Hogan.
You'll never regret it.
There you are.
We haven't been here
since last Christmas.
We were going to have
a Thanksgiving party.
That's nice.
What do you do up there?
You just, what, study?
- l want to be a teacher.
- Teacher?
That's very good.
You know, personally, l admire brains.
My brother Charlie is a brainy guy.
He had a couple of years of college.
lt isn't just brains.
lt's--
lt's how you use them.
Yeah, l get your thought.
You know l seen you
a lot of times before?
Remember parochial school...
out on Paluski Street,
seven, eight years ago?
- You had your hair--
- Braids.
Looked like a hunk of rope.
You had wires on your teeth...
and glasses.
You was really a mess.
l can get home all right now.
Thanks.
Don't get sore.
l'm just kidding you a little bit.
l just mean to tell you...
that you grew up very nice.
- Thanks.
- Get off!
You don't remember me, do you?
l remembered you
the first moment l saw you.
By the nose, huh?
That was a very interesting film.
Oh, you thought so?
Want to go to Sullivan's
for a bag of chips?
- No, thank you.
- l told your parents we'd be going.
- ls something the matter?
- Yes.
l don't want people thinking
that you and l are an article...
because we are not.
And l don't want you thinking
that we are, because we're not.
l don't feel that way about you.
That's all there is to it. l'm sorry.
l think your father...
would be very disappointed
to hear you say that, Benny.
l don't think you're in the situation
to be so proud and choosy.
Good night, Sean.
How long since your last confession?
Two weeks, Father.
Go on, my child.
l've had wrong thoughts
about my parents.
They want me to go to the university...
but they want me to stay
the little child as well.
And there's this man they want me
to marry for the sake of the business.
He's awful, Father.
l could never love him...
and l don't know why
they can't see that.
l do love them, but l'm finding it
awful hard to honor them.
ls there anything else?
l've had impure thoughts.
Did you entertain them?
l don't find any of it
tempting, really.
l don't look forward to that at all.
l do want children...
but it's such an ugly business,
don't you think?
- l don't know.
- You do.
Remember that time
we saw Willie Burns in the wood?
When he was playing with himself.
That horrible great red thing
he had on him.
Well, maybe
if you really loved a boy.
l do know what you mean, though.
Have a look in on the cottage.
We can do it up during the holidays.
- Maybe have a party.
- Great! See you Monday.
See you!
- There you are.
- Thanks, Teasie.
Thank you.
- Hello, Jack.
- Hey, Benny. You live here?
Yes. What are you doing here?
Father, this is Bernadette Hogan.
She's at the university as well.
Pleasure to meet you.
l wanted to visit an old colleague
of mine who hasn't been well.
Jack was good enough to drive me.
Well, couple of hours all right?
- Could you bear with him that long?
- l should think so.
Just about.
This is a nice surprise.
lt must be a desperate thing
to be a doctor...
to have to tell people
that they're dying and can't be cured.
l don't think l could bear that.
No. Nor me.
l'd run a mile first.
But you're going to be a doctor.
l know.
lsn't it drastic?
lt's not just that. l'm squeamish
about cutting people open...
and looking at their insides.
l get faint at the sight of blood.
lt's true.
l just pass out.
Have you told your father about this?
He says it's just a passing phase.
Maybe he's right.
lt is a great thing to do.
l just don't know
if l've got it in me.
What do you like to do?
l like sports.
Ah, Benny.
l just love to clown around.
l don't believe that.
lt's easy to talk to you.
You know that?
l feel as if l could
tell you anything.
You're very solid, aren't you?
Yes. Everyone notices that.
Solid. Beef to the heels,
like a Mullingar heifer.
No. l didn't mean that.
l meant...
you're really there.
You really know
who you are, don't you?
Well, yes,
of course l do.
Sometimes l feel as if
l'm hardly there at all.
Just trying to be things
for other people, you know?
lt was a great film altogether.
When she drops her glove, and
he picks it up and tries it on--
lt was so delicate.
lf he tried my glove on,
it would probably be too big for him.
What you doing?
About the same. See?
Not too bad then.
Not too bad.
Some of us are getting up a gang
to go to the college ball.
The big one at the Hibernian?
- Will you come?
- Me?
Really?
l'd love to.
There's a lot to be said
for these big, soft girls.
That one had a nice, soft look
about her.
Nice eyes.
Beautiful hair.
Lovely smile.
Fine set of teeth on her.
You don't miss much, do you, Dad?
l do not.
Jack Foley asked me
to go to the college ball.
That's great.
We're all going.
We're all in the gang.
Rosemary, Sheila Keohane.
Safety in numbers.
He did ask you personally.
He did make you special.
lt's all right. lt's fine!
We'll all go in a gang.
lt'll be great.
God, what am l going to wear? l've
nothing l don't look like a whale in.
l have nothing, full stop.
Maybe if l starve myself entirely
between now and Saturday--
You'll be gorgeous.
Look at those!
You've cut too much out of it.
No. Just about enough, l'd say.
lt's indecent.
Won't they fall out?
lf you've got them, flaunt them.
Keep your shoulders back.
- You'll be fine.
- Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
- l look like the prow of a ship.
- You look great.
Oh, glory, don't!
l do, don't l?
We all do.
Thanks, Nan.
You're a brilliant person altogether.
Here we go, girls.
Thanks.
How much did you say it was?
- Twelve bob.
- Have you got change?
How much is it?
Good evening, ladies.
Hello.
What are you doing here?
Are you going to the dance?
No, to my very great regret.
Simon Westward, Nan Mahon.
How do you do?
- Enjoy the dance.
- Thanks. We will.
lsn't this just as it should be?
lt's perfect altogether.
Right. Let's seize the moment.
Nan?
Will you dance?
Like to dance?
- Will you risk it?
- l'd love to.
This is nice, isn't it?
All of us going together.
You want to know how it happened?
Jack couldn't decide which one of you
he liked the best, so he asked you all.
lt looks as though
he's decided now, doesn't it?
l wouldn't be too sure.
Did you know
who you wanted to invite, Aidan?
Yes. Your friend Eve.
So why are you dancing with me
and not her?
Because l'm such a devious personality.
Do you think there's a chance there?
Would she go out with me if l asked her?
She might.
She's got very eccentric tastes.
There's hope for us all, Aidan.
There is so.
Watch out. Tricky step.
Don't you ever shut up?
Get out of here!
He likes you. He does.
- He talked about you the whole time.
- lf he likes me so much...
why does he spend the whole time
with you and Rosemary?
Let's face it. Why would he look at me?
He could have anyone at all.
No, he couldn't.
He couldn't have me, for a start.
l'm not interested in Jack,
not like that.
Or any of these boys.
They're just to practice on.
Go on. Ruin yourself.
Here's another one of your favorites.
- Are you all right?
- l'm just going to the ladies'.
Where you off to?
l was just coming to look for you.
Are you ready for a dance now?
You took your time, didn't you?
l'm sorry.
Don't be upset.
l was saving you till last.
l always save the best till last.
Don't be angry, please.
Come and dance.
You mustn't mess me about.
l know l may look like a rhinoceros,
but l have quite a thin skin really.
So just be a bit careful with me...
or l'll flatten you.
l won't mess you about.
Promise.
Come on.
Come and dance.
Good morning.
ls that the Westward residence?
Yes, ma'am.
Who do you wish to speak to?
Sir Victor Chamberlain would like
to speak to Mr. Simon Westward.
- l'm sorry. He isn't here.
- Oh, dear.
lt is rather urgent.
Do you know where Sir Victor
could find him?
- He's lunching at the Hibernian today.
- Benson! Rufus! Come on, boys!
You could try telephoning him there
a bit later.
Thank you so much.
Good day.
- Your usual table?
- Yes.
Hold on.
- Hello there.
- Hello.
- Dining alone?
- l'm afraid l am.
My father was to meet me, but he's
just phoned to say he can't make it.
ln that case,
why don't we lunch together?
Thank you.
That would be lovely.
This is a marvelous coincidence.
lsn't it?
l can tell you the truth.
What do you mostly tell?
l think l mostly tell people...
what l think they want to hear,
especially girls.
- But not me.
- No.
- Really?
- Try me.
Well...
do you believe in God and Jesus
and everything still?
Yes. Do you?
Yes.
Have you ever gone all the way
with a girl?
No. Not quite.
Nowhere near it.
W-Would you like to?
- What, now?
- No!
lt wasn't an invitation.
lt was just a request for information.
The answer is yes, l would.
lf only it weren't a mortal sin.
What about you?
l don't know.
Sometimes it seems like such a strange
sort of thing to want to do.
Ridiculous. Like someone else putting
their finger up your nose or something.
Then again...
when you're dancing, say...
and it seems like the most--
God, l'm blushing.
l can't believe
l'm having this conversation.
Nor can l.
lt's great, isn't it?
Yes.
lt is.
Oh, dear.
l think this is going to be a problem.
Our bodies belong to Almighty God...
just as our souls
belong to Almighty God.
just as our souls
belong to Almighty God.
A young woman's body...
should be like her soul--
a garden for Jesus.
l speak now particularly...
to the girls and the young women
of this congregation.
Which is it to be?
Gardens for Jesus...
or vessels of sin?
The answer
you hold within yourselves.
l can't help thinking
it isn't fair...
throwing the whole responsibility
onto us like that.
Aidan says it's his job
to try to seduce me...
and it's my job
to try to stop him.
What do you think, Nan?
l think it's nonsense-- all of it.
The priests just make it up
to suit themselves.
- You don't really think that, do you?
- l do.
Those French-letter things boys wear
to stop girls getting pregnant--
why are they called that?
lt's the French.
They're always up to something.
You've done wonders.
Aidan came and helped.
Well, he did most of it, really.
He was great altogether.
You're going to live here?
ln the holidays, just. Tell you the
truth, l feel a bit strange about it.
Why is that?
My mother died here, having me.
Then after that, my father.
l was thinking we might have a party,
warm the place up a bit.
lt has electricity.
We could play records.
We could invite all the boys.
Were you thinking of anyone
in particular?
Not at all. Not me.
Ah, now, that was
absolutely delicious...
Mrs. Hogan.
l can't remember ever setting eyes
on a more succulent bird.
The richness of it and the flavor--
altogether indisputable.
Why, thank you.
That's very kind of you.
No, no, it's you who are kind.
Well, now...
we couldn't have you festering away
on your own every Sunday, could we?
Sure, you're practically
one of the family now, so you are.
lt gives me great pleasure
to hear you say that.
l thought we might take
a breath of fresh air later.
Why...
that would be very nice
for you both.
l've been having a long talk
with your father.
Oh, yes.
About the possibility
of a partnership.
l have to think of the future,
you see.
l have my way to make.
l have my life to live.
Yes, of course you have.
l hope it works out just great for you.
Really, l do.
Has your father spoken to you about it?
No. Why would he? lt's between
you and him. lt's nothing to do with me.
Ah, but it is, you see.
You know l'm great for you.
lf we were to marry-- l'm not talking
about now. l'm talking about the future.
Well...
that would tie things up just grand,
don't you think so?
You and l...
we could rub around very nicely.
You know that?
No, we wouldn't. l don't want
to hurt your feelings, but...
really, it's out of the question.
- You think l'm not good enough for you.
- l didn't say that.
Look.
lf you must know,
l'm in love with someone else.
And who is he...
this " someone else" ?
- lt's like the longhouse.
- What is?
This is.
You know,
in " The Sexual Life of Savages."
Except that in the Trobriand lslands...
the parties go on for six months
without stopping.
Six months of unfettered
sexual experimentation.
- lmagine that.
- lt's different for them.
The Trobriand lslanders aren't Catholic.
They don't have to go to confession.
- You're afraid of them.
- Anyway, l'm not sure...
you'd be up to six months
of unfettered sexual experimentation.
l wouldn't mind a crack at it.
Societies regulate
the conduct of their members...
in a variety of ways.
The rule of law
is the most obvious.
There are also
the time-honored weapons...
of shame and guilt.
The Trobriand lslanders
contrived to live very happily...
without recourse
to shame and guilt.
ln lreland...
as you know...
we have them both.
And fear, of course.
And fear.
No, Jack, please! We mustn't!
Please, not here, not now.
l know. lt's desperate.
Where then, and when?
l want you to take me
to a nice hotel.
When? l can't wait much longer for you.
You won't have to.
lt could be any night that suits you
from the 5th to the 10th.
All right, you win.
What do l have to do?
You have to hold it in your hand...
for 60 seconds.
All right. l'll hold it.
But l won't jiggle it, understand?
ls that all you're taking off?
What?
No, l was just, you know--
What are you doing?
l thought we should--
lt's my first time.
- You don't mind, do you?
- Not at all.
l never imagined.
l wanted to save it
for someone really special.
Those Westwards who have the big estate
above Knockglen?
Well, now. You see?
What? You and him?
- Who do you think you are?
- Would you shut your hole...
you stupid article?
And you.
Will you bring him home to see us?
Yeah, right.
l don't think that would be
a very good idea.
The honorable Lavinia Ashmore...
only daughter
of Lord and Lady William Ashmore.
She's 28 years old.
She won't be too particular.
Judging from her photograph,
her husband won't have to be either.
Miss Phillida Foote-Crampe...
of Selly Oak.
Family owns a chain of slaughterhouses.
Very well off.
Miss Candida Cruise.
Looks like a sack of potatoes
on horseback, but her father...
made a million in gravel,
l think it was.
Miss Olivia Bacon-Batche.
- To England?
- lt's only a week.
We play four matches.
l wish you could come
and lend moral support.
lmmoral support
would be even more welcome.
Don't.
l could buy you
some of those French letters.
You know they sell them
over the counter there.
Just like that.
Just walk in the shop and ask for them.
Right out loud.
Nobody turns a hair.
lsn't that amazing?
Will l get a few packets then?
- We won't be seen, will we?
- No, it's all right.
No one comes up here,
just the nuns from the convent...
and they're all locked up
by 7:00 in the evening.
What did you say to Eve?
Of course you didn't mention me.
l didn't ask Eve at all.
l don't think Eve would understand.
You might be interested in this.
l picked it up last year
when l was over in London.
"The Art of Married Love,"
by Van der Kant.
He's a Dutchman, but he's
a fully qualified medical consultant.
Look.
l was wondering if we might try...
something like...
that.
Would you like to?
Well, l think l would, yes.
Only if you would.
Who is that little chap?
lt's called the lnfant of Prague.
Prague. God, you're so strange,
you people.
Don't say that.
- What?
- Don't say, " you people."
l'm not like them. l'm like you.
Sorry. l simply meant--
l'm like you. l'm not like them.
We're nothing to do
with all that nonsense, are we?
l'm like you, aren't l?
Yes, in a very important way.
The most important way.
Yes, perhaps.
Well, now, ladies and gentlemen...
not so often we see one of these.
Would anybody like to hazard a guess
about the cause of death?
Tertiary syphilis.
"l can't understand it, Doctor.
l had a few open sores...
but they seemed to go away
of their own accord."
That was the first stage, of course.
Later stages attack...
bodily tissue.
You see here?
lt's almost completely gone.
By this time...
he'll also have
extensive suffering of the brain.
lf you'll bear with me
for a few moments...
we'll just saw
the poor fellow's head open.
l'll show you what l mean.
lt's all right. l'll be fine.
lt's just--
l hate that anatomy stuff.
Why don't you tell your father
you want to give up the course?
l couldn't.
He never says anything about it...
but l know it would break his heart
if l gave it up.
Sure, l can do it.
l have to do it.
l have to get something right.
This is lovely.
lt is.
You shouldn't have, though,
with all that study to do.
l wanted to give you a break.
And?
l wanted to talk to you...
about maybe staying in Dublin
during term time.
Week nights only.
l suppose it can't be much fun
for you around here.
Oh, Daddy, l didn't mean that...
but l would like to see
more of my friends...
and l hate having to get the bus
no matter what.
Have you any particular friends in mind?
Yes.
Jack.
l love him.
You went to university to study,
not to fall in love.
Now, if he's a good boy...
if he's worth having,
he'll be patient.
He'll wait for you.
Your mother's right.
He'll wait...
if he's the right sort.
Like Sean bloody Walsh.
Patiently wheedling himself
into a share of the business.
Patiently creeping around me, hoping
he'll wear me down and l'll marry him.
Then he'll get the house and everything.
l don't know why
you let me go to university.
lt's like taking me to a mountaintop
and showing me the world...
and then marching me back down, saying,
"That's what you can't have...
you silly, great, fat article.
This is what you can have:
Knockglen for the rest of your life...
and married to Sean bloody Walsh!"
l'd rather be married
to a bloody lizard!
Don't you ever...
ever...
talk to your mother or me
like that again.
l've enough--
lsn't it enough that
we worry sick about the business...
without having to listen to this--
That's my dinner done.
l couldn't eat another bite!
Quiet again?
Yes.
l'm not feeling the best today.
l think, if it's all right with you,
l'll go home early.
You leave it to me.
l have everything under control.
Yes.
That's it.
Well.
Thank you, Walter.
Who's that girl?
She looks like a film star.
That's Nan Mahon.
Mahon's, the builders.
They were in Knockglen
when Nan was small.
lt's a great mark of respect
to Mr. Hogan--
so many Dublin folk here.
lt's altogether very gratifying.
Nan Mahon, did you say?
Yes. Why do you ask?
You don't know her, do you?
No.
l couldn't say l know her,
Miss Malone.
l just have the feeling
l've seen her somewhere before.
l think she's a friend
of our fine Mr. Westward.
- How are you getting on in Dublin?
- Are you enjoying college life, dear?
Yeah. Everyone likes it.
l feel so awful.
Almost the last thing l did was yell
and carry on at him like a big fishwife.
Come on.
l never knew such a good girl
to her parents.
lt's so hard.
He loved me so much, you know?
He was always giving me things...
but they were always the wrong things.
l kept thinking, " Daddy...
couldn't you just get one thing right
in your life, just for once?"
You see?
l was always a nasty,
ungrateful girl in my heart.
And now he's dead.
l'm sorry. l'll stop now.
lt's always that way.
All parents are the same.
Really what they want
is for you to be like them.
l'll have to stay home and look after
my mother and the shop and everything.
She's collapsed entirely.
l won't be able to see you.
lt'll be weeks and weeks.
You can't come to Dublin at all?
Not for a while.
l'll be in the shop every day.
Mother's not fit to be left.
lt has to be done.
- lt's only for a while.
- l know.
l don't see why business
has been so bad.
Custom hasn't fallen away that much...
so why are the receipts so low?
Ah, now, this would be
the double entry system.
lt isn't everyone
can grasp it right away.
Have you talked to Mr. Duggan
at all yet...
about your father's wishes
for the future of the business?
Tomorrow, Sean.
That's good.
lt will be great to have everything
cut and dried...
won't it?
Then we can see our way ahead.
Shouldn't the weekly takings
correspond to the figures...
in the bank lodgement book here?
Approximately, yes,
give or take the drawings.
The drawings?
Whatever your father withdrew
from the till in cash.
For petrol, as it might be.
Or perhaps to buy you
a lovely costume...
such as the one you're wearing
at the moment.
Oh, dear, Mr. Duggan.
lt's the most awful quandary.
l don't know what to do for the best.
lf you've any doubt about Mr. Walsh
or the partnership...
l urge you to think very carefully.
Legally, you may do as you wish.
Don't rush into anything.
We won't. Thanks.
Take care now.
- Thank you.
- Not at all.
l don't think you should let Sean Walsh
get one sniff of the partnership.
But if it's what your father wanted--
He was always saying he wished
he could pay Sean more.
There was no need for that if
he was helping himself out of the till.
Quiet.
l won't believe that of Sean.
He's always been so good...
and he hasn't spent ten pence on himself
in the ten years he's been in Knockglen.
That's true.
l wonder what
he's done with it all, Mother.
l just know he's not right.
That is enough.
Poor Jack. He is missing you,
but he hasn't a chance to be bad.
We don't let him out of our sight.
We made him go to the pictures with us,
Nanny and Aidan.
- And he cried.
- No. Did he?
God, l do miss him.
l went to see Mother Francis
at the convent.
Do you know what she said? Someone's
getting into the cottage at night.
Who?
l don't believe it.
Someone thought they saw a light
and smoke coming from the chimney.
Haunted, maybe.
Ah, no. Ghosts are a bit classy
for Knockglen.
Secret lovers.
All right, l cannot tell a lie.
lt was me and Sean Walsh from the shop.
Oh, God!
He's like a lizard!
How do you think lizards make love?
l'll show you.
That will be one-eleven.
lf he doesn't like it,
tell him we'll find one to suit him.
- That's very good of you. Thank you.
- Good-bye now.
You're getting into the way of it fine.
l'm glad you think so.
There's a good film
coming to the Palladium this Friday.
"Rebel Without A Cause."
How many times must l tell you not to
wear that green apron day in, day out?
How many times must l tell you not to
wear that green apron day in, day out?
l feel like l'm living
in an institution!
Nasey, you dirty-looking idiot.
Now look what you have to do.
lf you don't wipe that grin...
off your face, l'll knock it off.
Christ, this is awful.
- Quite sure?
- Yes.
l'm two months gone.
Got the result this morning.
God moves in a mysterious way,
l suppose.
Christ, this is terrible.
lt doesn't have to be, does it?
No, you're right.
God, you're really something.
You're a wonderful girl.
l've never known anybody like you.
Good.
l really never thought it could happen.
No one ever does.
My poor darling.
l'll take care of you.
lt's not the end of the world.
Listen. l had all this
from a very close friend.
lt's someone you've met,
but it wouldn't do to name names.
She said there's nothing to it at all.
lt's in England, of course,
but it's all for the best.
You mustn't worry about money.
l'll cover all your expenses.
You want me to get rid of it.
Of course. What else?
l thought we would be married.
That's out of the question.
l thought you loved me.
You kept telling me you loved me.
Well, l did.
l mean, l do, insofar as--
You must have realized.
l have to marry for money.
We lose the house;
the whole family goes down.
Can't afford to marry you now,
however much l'd want to.
No, l hadn't realized that.
lt was very silly and naive of me.
l see that now.
l can't take that.
l'm a Catholic. l can't help it.
l couldn't kill my baby.
Jesus, you people!
Take it anyway.
Guilt money.
Will it bounce?
Good-bye.
lt was lovely.
l know.
You're a really shitty article.
You know that, don't you?
- You going to be in for your tea?
- No, ma'am.
l'm going out.
- Like a drink?
- Maybe later, Bill.
l'm looking for someone.
Hello, stranger.
Nan! What are you doing here?
l was looking for Eve and Aidan,
but it doesn't matter.
l found you instead.
l don't think l've ever seen you
on your own before.
Ah, well.
l thought tonight
was the Rugby Club social.
That's just it.
l was trying to get Benny to come,
but she couldn't...
or wouldn't.
You'd think if she cared enough,
she'd manage something.
Her mother won't fall apart if she's
left alone the odd night, will she?
Or am l being unfair?
l think she feels
she's all her mother has now...
being an only child.
lt's a shame, though.
Why don't l come with you?
Would that be nice?
Yeah.
All right.
lt, uh, can get a bit rough.
You'd look after me, wouldn't you?
l feel safe with you.
Come on. lt'd be great.
We can cheer each other up.
What are we doing?
Make me warm.
Feel me.
Oh, God, Nan.
l never meant anything
like that to happen.
Don't blame yourself.
lt was my fault
as much as yours.
We just got carried away.
lt's nothing to do
with you and Benny.
No one knows except us,
and we need never tell anyone.
And it needn't ever happen again.
But it was lovely, Jack.
No, it was nothing in particular.
l'm sorry to have bothered you.
Could you just tell him l called?
Of course l will, Bernadette.
How are things going, dear?
Are you still stuck in the shop?
How's your mother now?
We're thinking of her.
Thanks. Bye.
So, when we've made a sale,
we put a little tick...
here at the back,
and it's against the stock register.
That's it, Mrs. Hogan.
You've got it in one.
Jack? l can start coming
to lectures again.
Mother's so much better,
she's going to take over in the shop.
And Eve's going to have another party,
so l hope you come to that.
You know, l've been having
a bit of a brood about you and me.
l think l've changed
my mind about something.
l can't say it over the phone,
but l think you'll like it.
l haven't let you get a word in
edgewise. Will l see you tomorrow then?
Where will we meet?
l'll meet the bus.
Benny, there's something
l have to tell you too.
What's the matter?
Let's get out of here.
lt's Nan.
- She's pregnant.
- Oh, God.
Poor Nan.
- ls she very upset?
- She's out of her mind with worry.
lsn't that amazing?
She's the last one
l would have thought of.
Do you know who the boy is?
The baby's mine.
We're getting married.
lt's all my fault.
Your fault?
Because he wanted me
to do it with him.
And l wanted to as well so much.
And we so nearly did,
lots of times.
lf we had done it,
it'd be me having his baby and not Nan.
l don't care what the priests say!
We should do what we feel!
Like Jack, you mean.
He certainly pleased himself, didn't he?
No, he loves me. He told me.
He doesn't love her.
He's going to marry her
because of the baby.
- Poor Jack.
- Benny, for God's sake!
He was your boyfriend!
She was your friend!
Why couldn't they just
leave each other alone?
l don't know.
They don't know.
lt's not like them.
lt's not like either of them.
Maybe someone
put something in the drinks.
Benny, will you grow up?
l'm never going to speak
to Jack Foley again...
and if she comes anywhere near me,
l'll kill her!
l mean it.
What am l going to do?
l'll tell you one thing
you're going to do.
Show a brave face. Never let them
see how much they've hurt you.
lt's a bit late for that now.
All right.
l'll try.
Here's to the happy couple.
"Wicklow man entices
neighbor's ferret."
- Aidan.
- What?
Someone has been
using the cottage.
They used this
to light the fire.
lt's dated March the fourth.
l haven't lit a fire in here
since February.
They were very neat.
Well, they didn't break in.
They must've found the key.
They just used it, l suppose.
This is a mistake.
lt'll be fun. Believe me.
You're the star, Jack.
Anything you do is fine by them.
- Hello, Benny.
- Hello.
How's your mother?
How's the shop?
Fine, thank you.
So, how are you?
- Are you all right?
- l'm fine.
l didn't think you were coming.
lt's a bit sudden.
lt seems a bit too soon.
Don't worry.
l'm fine.
- Where is Eve?
- She's in the kitchen.
Didn't think you had the nerve, Nan.
Brought you a present, Eve.
That's gonna make
everything all right, is it?
l just thought you'd like it...
as a jug or to put flowers in.
l always thought there should
be one here, but l never--
When?
When did you think that?
What?
That old newspaper in the grate.
lt was you.
You came to my cottage.
- Wait.
- No, you wait!
l knew it wasn't haunted.
l knew someone had been here.
lt was you.
And long before Jack.
Oh, God, l see it all now.
- Eve, please.
- Will you tell Jack or will l?
- Tell him what?
- lt was you, wasn't it?
lt was you here...
with Simon Westward, wasn't it?
That's what Sean Walsh
was talking about at the funeral.
He saw you and Westward here.
That's his baby
you're carrying, isn't it?
Anyone could've told you
that cold fish wouldn't marry you.
So you had to go and steal Jack
from your best friend!
You don't know what
you've done, do you?
You've broken Benny's heart!
l wish l could hurt you!
- Take it easy!
- l will not take it easy!
She's mad! Jack!
l think somebody's hurt.
lt's all right, Nan.
- ls she bad?
- lt's all right.
lt's all right.
He's looking after her.
Here, Jack.
- Look at her arm.
- Get her up.
lt's all right, Nan.
Oh, Jesus.
Let's get her to a hospital.
Do you see anything you like, madam?
No, go ahead.
Have a good look.
You must be dying for it...
now your fellow's decided
he'd rather diddle your best friend.
The time and the place.
l think you've
kept me waiting long enough.
- Sean, don't be stupid.
- l'm not the stupid one.
Don't you know
this was meant to happen?
My mistake was
being too patient.
Sure, l'm doing you a favor.
There's not many men
would take you on at all.
But l've always had
an eye for you, Benny.
Take your clothes off.
lt's all right.
l've locked the front door.
No one's going to interrupt us.
Come on.
Don't be shy.
- l will if you will.
- Are you mad?
Take your clothes off now!
Get off!
Get off me!
Ah, Jesus!
What are these, Sean?
This would be
your double-entry bookkeeping, would it?
l was owed that money, Benny,
every penny.
What your father paid me
wouldn't keep a rat.
He trusted you,
and you robbed him blind!
l never spent a penny of it.
l was saving it for us.
How dare you! Get out of here
before l call the guard!
l would've married you, Benny...
and there's not many would say that,
fat cow that you are...
even though l'm worth ten of you
and all your family put together.
l wouldn't touch you now.
Give me a hundred
and we'll call it quits.
Take it.
All the remaining passengers
for England, please go to gate two.
You shouldn't have come.
l'm glad you did, but it's
nothing to do with you anymore.
l hate to see you
leaving like this.
Look at the state you're in.
We women are tougher
than we look.
l'm sorry, Jack.
l was a bit desperate, you see.
All passengers for England,
please board the ship now.
Give my love to Benny.
Will you go in the back,
please, Mother?
Yes, sir.
Can l help you?
Look, Benny.
l know l've no right
to expect anything of you.
You haven't.
l want you to know--
- lt was that thing with Nan.
- l don't want to know about it.
l mean stopping the bleeding.
When l realized l was saving her life,
that she could have died...
all l could think was
how grateful l was that l could do it.
l wasn't faint or sick.
l was fine.
l knew right then that that was what
l wanted to do for the rest of my life.
Well, l'm very glad for you.
The other thing is...
l love you.
l never loved her.
You know that.
And if you'll have me...
l want to marry you.
Benny, you're the one.
l couldn't love anyone else.
Marry me?
- Yes.
- And...
why would l want to do that?
l suppose l have ruined things.
Benny, l'm sorry.
l want to make it up to you.
l will, if you'll let me.
Do you think
you could love me again?
No. l don't think l could.
Yeah, that's a lie.
l could love you again,
but l'm not sure that l want to.
You broke my heart...
and l'm not the same person
that l was, now.
So if you're serious...
you'd have to get to know me
as l am now, and...
l'd have to get to know you
as you are now.
And then we'll just see.
Jack was telling the truth.
Over the next year, he pursued
his medical studies like a demon.
He also pursued me.
l moved to Dublin in the autumn
to share a flat with Eve...
and at the university, my paper...
comparing the lrish Catholic mating
rites with the Trobriand lslanders...
caused quite a stir...
and it pointed me towards
my future career as a writer.
And slowly...
as Jack and l spent
more and more time together...
l suppose l fell in love
with him again.
One afternoon, we found ourselves
back at Eve's cottage.
- What are we doing here?
- Come on.
Bless me, Father,
for l have sinned.
