A lot of stuff that he just doesn't understand about the world
that I understand that makes -- it makes all my actions
when I move through the world--
I do things better
because I can see it all laid out like a map.
Have you ever looked at a map?
- Yes. When I'm not mistaken. - Do you know how to read a map?
- Do you know how to read a map? - Yeah.
Your father's a perfectly good guy,
but there's a lot of stuff
that he just doesn't understand about the world
- that I understand. - My dad--
- Wait. Listen. - My daddy's--
I haven't asked you a question yet.
I haven't asked you a question.
- Listen. Shh. - My daddy--
Don't tell your mother. Shut up! By quiet.
Shush. I haven't asked you the question yet.
I haven't asked you anything. Listen. Shh.
Quiet. We got it. Don't worry about it.
Listen.
If there was--
if you could take one guy to an island with you
and you knew you'd be safe because he was the best man
and he was going to figure out how to survive,
he was going to make everything--
make the world a good place on the island,
he was going to keep you happy,
he-- this is the best man for the job, no matter what,
if it was between me and your father,
- who would you say? - My daddy.
I don't see-- hang on a second.
Hang on a second. Listen.
I think you're wrong about that.
It's your choice to make, but I want you to understand something:
That there's a lot of--
Pick up-- what hap-- what is that?
You can't leave your fishing rod like that.
I don't know why the hell it keeps dripping.
All night long-- drip, drip, drip.
I've had the fucking thing repaired ten times.
You need a new stopper.
Is that it?
Your stopper's--
it's rotted all around the edges,
so it's not making a seal.
The water's going to drip through to the bowl.
I could, uh--
I could bring you a new one tomorrow.
Or you might want to consider replacing the whole apparatus.
What do you recommend?
I could replace the stopper first.
If that doesn't work,
I could replace the whole apparatus.
You can't give me a professional recommendation?
Well, it's really up to you.
Tomorrow my sister-in-law's coming over with the nephews.
I got to take the car in.
No, it's my sister Jeanine's oldest daughter's bat mitzvah.
Sank 200 ships--
I'm looking forward to being bored to death.
The storm demonstrated the need for more--
The girl doesn't want it, her father doesn't want it,
and don't even ask me.
Seven hours in the car.
...charge and leave their cities--
I could really slit my throat.
But oh, well. The little girls are charming.
Lee, I'm so sorry.
That's okay.
This is so gross.
That's all right.
No, tell him to come.
Okay. Yeah.
But-- but-- but, Cindy, I have to tell you something.
I'm, like, in love with my janitor.
Is that sick?
Have you ever had a sexual fantasy about your handyman?
Well, it's awkward because he's literally, like,
cleaning the shit out of my toilet bowl right now,
and I don't think I'm at my most alluring.
Yeah, maybe you're right.
It's not like I met him socially.
Okay, thank you, Cindy.
Okay. Like 20 minutes. Bye.
Uh, hi. All set.
Thank you so much.
You're welcome.
Can I give you a tip?
You mean like a suggestion?
No. I mean like a tip.
Okay. Thank you.
- Okay. - Okay.
Good night.
Good night. Goodbye.
I mean, how many times do I have to fix these fucking pipes?
Every time I take a shower,
the entire apartment has a flood.
It's driving me insane.
Well, I'll get you a plumber here tomorrow,
but I'd say we're going to have to break through the tile
and isolate the leak because
there's quite a lot of water down there.
How do you know it's me? Why is it automatically me?
Because if it was coming from higher up,
you'd have water damage in your ceiling
or in your wall, and it's all dry.
Great.
It might just be the caulking.
This whole tub needs to be recaulked.
Have you taken a bath or a shower in the last couple of hours?
Yes.
It might just be that.
Okay. And how are you planning to find that out?
Well, we could run the shower and see if it drips downstairs.
Oh, you want me to take a shower right now?
No.
You want me to take a shower right now
while you stand there watching to see
if it drips into the Friedrichs' apartment?
I don't give a fuck what you do, Mrs. Olsen.
I'm just trying to fix the fucking leak.
I-- I like that.
How dare you talk to me like that.
Get the fuck out of my fucking house.
- Okay. - Get the fuck
out of my fucking house before I call the police.
All right.
Did you hear me? I said get out.
I can't. You're blocking the doorway.
What the fuck's the matter with you?
You can't talk to the tenants like that.
Look, Lee, you do good work. You're dependable.
But I get these complaints all the time.
You're rude, you're unfriendly.
You won't say good morning. I mean, come on.
Mr. Emery, I fix the plumbing,
take out the garbage, paint their apartments.
I do electrical work, which we both know is against the law.
I show up on time.
I'm working four buildings,
and you're getting all the money.
So do whatever you're going to do.
Would you be willing to apologize to Mrs. Olsen?
For what?
All right. All right. I'll talk to her.
- Here, Lee. - Thanks.
- How are you doing? - Good.
How's things going, all right?
Yeah.
Watch the game?
Yeah, I did.
You think they got a shot?
- No. - You bet?
Yeah, I would.
They dropped the first two. They're going to lose the next three.
- Here you go. - Thanks.
Oh, my god. I'm so sorry.
That's okay.
Did I get you?
Yes.
- I got you. - That's okay.
- Let me get you some napkins. - I'm okay.
Hey, Lenny, can I grab some napkins?
Thanks.
Thank you.
Here.
Thanks.
It's okay.
Well, now I spilled my beer all over you,
- my name's Sharon. - Thank you.
Uh, it's okay.
And you are?
Uh, Lee.
- Ask anybody. - Okay.
Here he comes.
How you doing?
- How you doing? - Good. I'm good.
Hey, can I ask you guys, do you know me?
- Uh, I don't think so. - Yeah, I don't think so either.
We never met?
- No. - No, not yet.
- No, I don't think so. - No.
So what the fuck are you looking at me for?
- Excuse me? - I said what the fuck are you looking at me for?
- Hey, take a fuckin' walk. - Sir, we weren't looking at you.
No, don't apologize to this asshole.
- Take a fuckin' hike. - We weren't looking at you, seriously.
Come on, man! Hey!
Let me go! I gotta go take a hike!
I wanna take a fuckin' hike!
Hello, this is Lee.
Oh. Okay.
When did that happen?
Well, how's he doing now?
No, don't do that.
I'm gonna come up there right now.
I'll be up there in an hour and a half.
Okay?
Thank you.
Bye.
Mr. Emery, it's Lee again. I contacted Jose.
He can cover me till Friday night at least.
Uh, after that,
Gene Macadavey will take over until I get back.
I wouldn't do anything with the Mr. and Mrs. Friedrichs' ceiling
until you you get a real plumber in there.
But what are you gonna do?
I will, uh, let you know as soon as I have more information.
I should be in Manchester a week at least.
Thank you very much. Bye.
Come on!
Go!
Social services volunteer to inpatient admitting.
Can we get a social services volunteer to inpatient admitting?
- Hey, Lee. - Is he dead?
I'm sorry, Lee.
He passed away about an hour ago.
I'm so sorry.
- Did you see him? - No.
- I mean, I brought him in. - George brought him in.
We were looking at the boat this morning,
and he just...
I don't know, he just, like, fell over.
I thought he was kidding me at first.
Then I called the ambulance, and, uh...
That was it.
I'll just call Dr. Muller and tell him that you're here.
Where's Dr. Betheny?
Oh, she's on maternity leave. Here he is.
Lee, I'm Dr. Muller. We spoke on the phone.
- Yeah, hi. - I'm very, very sorry.
- Thank you. - Hello, George.
- Hiya, Jim. - How you holding up?
Oh, great, you know?
- It's a very sad day. - Yeah.
Where's my brother?
Oh, he's downstairs. You can see him if you want.
What happened to him?
Just a cardiac arrest.
You know his heart's very weak at this point.
It just gave out.
I'm really sorry you couldn't get here in time,
but as I told you before...
Aw, fuck this.
Sorry.
- That's okay, buddy. - That's perfectly all right.
Did anybody call my uncle?
It's their uncle Donny.
Yeah, my aunt and uncle.
- Somebody should have called... - No, Lee. Lee, no.
- What? What? - Donny got a job in Minnesota.
- Like, a while ago. - Minnesota?
Yeah, he got a job in some outfit
in Mnnetonka, Minnesota,
if you can believe that.
- Joe didn't tell you about that? - No.
Dr. Hallerin, if you're on fourth floor,
please come to the nurses station.
I can call him if you want, Lee,
and tell him what happened.
- Okay, thanks. - No problem.
Tell him what happened.
Tell him I'll call him tonight.
Talk about arrangements.
Somebody should call my wife.
- Your, uh, uh... - Ex-wife.
- You mean Randi? - Randi.
- Yes, I'm sorry. I meant Randi. - That's okay.
I already thought of that. I'll take care of it.
- Okay. Thank you. - No problem.
- Can I see him now? - Sure.
Lee, I can wait up here.
Lee, if you need anything.
Okay.
- Thanks. - Yeah.
Would you like a Kleenex?
- Yeah, thanks. Yeah. - Yeah.
Can I get a couple Kleenex, please?
Thanks, hon.
- I'm sorry. - Oh, please.
- How is Dr. Betheny? - Oh, she's doing very well.
She just had twin girls.
- Oh, Irene told me that. - Yeah.
I call this afternoon and tell her what happened.
She was very good to him.
Yeah, she was.
The disease is commonly referred to as congestive heart failure.
- Oh, my God. - Are you familiar with it?
- No. - Then what are you saying "Oh, my God" for?
Because-- what is it?
She's trying to explain it, honey.
- I'm sorry, Dr. Beth... - Betheny.
- Betheny, I'm sorry. - Not a problem.
So you were saying.
It's a gradual deterioration of the muscles of the heart.
It's usually associated with older people.
But in rare cases, it will occur in a younger person.
Some people live up to 50-60 years
with just an occasional attack.
But most people suffer periodic episodes,
like the one you had on Monday,
which mimic the symptoms of a heart attack,
and which further weaken the muscle.
They can put you out of commission for a week, two weeks.
And you'll need to be hospitalized so we can monitor your heart,
because the risk of cardiac arrest is elevated for a week or two.
Oh, my God.
- But in between,  - It's okay.
most people feel perfectly healthy.
You can basically live a normal life.
Wait. So what do you mean some people live to be 50-60 years?
I mean, are you saying total?
Or are saying when they're diagnosed with this?
Or what? What are you saying?
And tell me the fuckin' truth.
Total.
For most people with the particulars of your condition,
the average life expectancy is five to ten years.
The statistics vary widely.
You're not a statistic.
You're just one person,
and we don't know what's gonna happen to you yet.
But it's not a good disease.
What is a good disease?
- Poison Ivy. - Athlete's foot?
- It's a comedy routine. - Elise, please.
- For Christ's sake. - Oh, my God!
When am I gonna put one foot right?
- How about a hint? - Elise...
- Daddy. - What?
She's fine.
We're all upset.
We're all gonna listen,
then we're gonna ask any of the questions we wanna ask,
and then we're gonna figure out what to do together, right?
- Right. - Sure.
So you were saying, Dr. Beth.
- Betheny, Dad. - It's Dr. Betheny, Dad.
Get it right.
I do not see where the humor lies in this situation.
- Elise, you must calm down. - No.
- I'm sorry, I'm not trying to... - No, no, don't.
No more. I'm not gonna. Nope.
- Elise, let me get you a glass of water. - No.
- Daddy, forget it. - Forget it like you.
Everybody should be just like you.
You know what? I am tired of being the bad guy here.
Jesus Christ! Who's in the fuckin' hospital here?
Right. Right. So I'll be the bad guy,
and you be in the hospital and explain the jokes to your son.
- I'm going home. - You're going home?
- You're going home? - Yep!
- Let me get her back. - Fuck her.
- Come on with that stuff already! - Stop that shit!
Thank you, Tony.
Thank you.
I have to get up to Manchester.
Nobody told Patrick, right?
No, you had asked for us to wait for you to get here.
- Yes. Thank you. - Okay.
So, um,
what is the procedure now?
Oh, now you have to make arrangements with a funeral parlor.
And they pretty much take care of everything.
I don't know the name of one.
That's all right. We can help you with that.
Oh, yeah.
And they'll just come and pick him up?
- Yeah. - Yes.
- I can make those calls, Lee. - Okay.
Let me know if you need any help with anything.
Okay. Thank you.
Yeah, we've gotta talk about the boat
and the website,
and all that.
Sure. I'm around.
I gotta get up there before school let's out, so--
You just have to sign for Joe's belongings.
Right this way.
Just gotta sign right here.
Dr. Hallerin, if you're on fourth floor,
please come to the nurses station.
Where's Joe's belongings? The plastic bag right here.
Sorry. Give me a sec.
Where's Joe's belongings?
All right, all right. That's good. Hup!
- Like that? - Yeah, but keep your thumb off the line,
because, if you get a strike,
it's gonna slice it right open,
and you know what happens then?
- What? - The sharks will smell the blood,
and they'll rip this boat apart.
- No, they won't. - Yeah, they will.
Dad, will they?
- Yes, sir. - Shut up.
You know, I seen a school of sharks tear a boat to pieces
like it was made of cardboard,
because some kid threw a band-aid in the water.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, he did.
- Oh, yeah. - No, you didn't.
Sometimes the only way to keep them off is to throw the kid
directly in the ocean to distract them.
Shut up. Sharks don't even swim in schools.
He says sharks don't swim in schools.
- Smart kid. - Yeah, he is.
A really smart kid is exactly the kind of quality meal
a humongous school of sharks
is looking for when they're circling a boat.
Oh, Uncle Lee, shut up.
Hey, you got a strike! Strike, strike, strike!
Ease up on the drag, and watch your fuckin' thumb!
- You got a strike now! - Jesus! Don't hit me!
- No swearing! - He got a strike!
- Ease up on it. - I got it! We got it!
Drive the boat! Mind your business!
- You gotta get the hook in him. - What kind of fish is it?
We're fine! Shut up! Mind your business!
- What kind of fish is it? - Great white.
- It's gotta be a great white. - Come on!
- It's gotta be a great white. - Shut up!
Or maybe a barracuda. Who knows?
It's not a shark!
- Come on, pull him up! - It's not a shark!
- Just stop talking! - Come on!
How come that's connected to those?
It's not connected, it just looks that way.
I'm trying to teach you the islands.
That's the island the rich guy bought
so no one else would put a house on it.
That's how rich he is.
Baker island, Misery island.
Misery island's where me and your aunt Randi got married.
- Hello? - Yeah, hi.
Suzy, daddy's home.
Hi, Suzy. Daddy's home.
- Hi, daddy. - Hi, sweetheart.
Hug.
Oh, Jesus Christ! You're breaking my neck!
Lee?
Yeah, hang on.
- Hey. Did you have a good time? - Yeah, really good.
- Where's your mother? - They just left.
Oh, no!
Yeah, she said missed you too.
Well, there's always next time. Did you get any sleep?
Oh, yeah, it's so restful when my mother's here.
Oh, too bad. Hi, Kary.
- Hi, daddy. - Come here.
- Put me down. - I'm putting you down. Relax.
I'm just giving you a kiss. Honey, all right--
Karen! Karen!
- I almost dropped you on your head. - Jesus.
I'm making a hair salon.
Oh, yeah? It's really good.
You wanna cut my hair?
It's just for girls. I'm sorry.
That's all right. I understand, sweetheart.
Can I watch TV to get some ideas?
- No. - Yeah.
Go ahead.
Get off.
Oh, god.
How you feeling?
Better.
- Yeah? - Yeah.
You sound better.
So did you guys actually use the fishing tackle?
Oh, yeah, we really did.
Patty caught a humongous bluefish-- 18 pounds.
Oh, yeah? Well, that's awesome.
Oh, I never seen anybody so happy in my whole life.
Its nice in here.
You keep it nice.
- What a homemaker. - Fuck off.
All right. Get away from me.
Stop it.
Oh, don't. Stop.
Please, I'm sick.
Okay. For real, get off of me.
- Hi, Stanny. - Oh, god, let him alone.
- How come you're not crying? - I just got him settled.
- What are you getting him settled for? - Lee, don't pick him up.
If he's not crying, leave well enough alone.
Leave well enough alone. That's what me and your mommy
should have done instead of getting married.
- Oh, shut up. - Then you wouldn't be here.
Your sisters wouldn't be here,
and I could watch the football
game in my own living room with peace and quiet.
You know what? You can go fuck yourself.
Oh, jeez waste. Hey, kiddo.
Oh, my gosh. You're very handsome, you know that?
See that? I didn't make him cry.
Up and down.
He's not crying...
'Cause I know how to handle him.
How is he? How's Joe?
He's fine. You know, he's-- he's all right.
Actually, he's doing all right.
And you didn't run out of beer? You got through the day okay?
Oh, yeah. We were very temperate.
I don't know why you guys bother getting on the friggin' boat.
What do you mean? We love the sea.
Oh, yeah? How many beers did you have on the sea?
- Eight. - Eight?
Yep, eight, over a seven-hour period, which--
Wow, I am well impressed.
...is...
...1.1428572 beers an hour.
It's like you didn't even have anything to drink at all.
Yeah, I told you I was cutting down.
Oh, god, no. What do you think you're gonna do?
I guess I'm gonna take a shower.
Randi, I swear to god.
You should have seen his face.
So happy.
It was like when we took the girls on the merry-go-round.
I mean, it was just pure happiness.
Oh, come on, I'm sick.
I'm sick. I'm really, really, deeply sick.
It's hard to breathe.
He's not at school? I thought school left out--
- I'm pretty sure he would have-- - What?
I'm sorry, Paul, my phone is--
- Sorry. Say that again? - That's all right.
I'm pretty sure he would have left for hockey practice by now.
He's on the hockey team?
Yeah. Yeah, he's doing real well too.
Hey, how's Joe doing? He gonna be okay?
Yeah, he's fine.
Where's the practice? Is it at the school?
No, they practice at Gloucester around.
- They practice in the-- - I'm sorry.
- It's not at the school? - No.
What? I'm sorry.
- Can you hear me? - The phone is--
That's all right. Can you hear me?
- Yes. - It's at Gloucester, okay?
Okay. I understand.
We play with the Rockport team, but they're the lead team.
Okay, I understand. Thank you, Paul.
Yeah, sure thing. Give Joe my regards, all right?
- I will. - What's up?
Uh, Joe Chandler's in the hospital again.
Oh, how awful.
- Who was on the phone? - That was Lee Chandler.
- Lee Chandler? - The very one.
Knock it off!
Chandler! Knock it off!
One more time and you're out.
You understand that, Chandler? One more time.
- Ah, fuck me. - What's that?
- Fuck my fuckin' ass. - All right, you're out.
Chandler, you're benched.
All right. Ask me if I give a shit.
What was that?
Coach, that's his uncle.
His father must be in the hospital.
Whose father, Chandlers?
Yeah, he only comes around--
He's got congestive heart failure.
Patrick's dad, I mean, not-- not Patrick.
So that's Lee Chandler. The Lee Chandler, huh?
Yeah, but coach, you know that story's bullshit, right?
Total bullshit, coach.
You guys wanna watch the language?
- Sorry. - Sorry.
All right. Mind your own business for a little while, huh?
Let's take a break. Get a water.
So, uh, something going on with your dad?
His father passed away this morning.
Oh, jeez. I'm sorry to hear that. I really am.
I, uh-- well, listen, do what you gotta do.
I, uh-- I feel terrible.
Why don't you, uh--
all right, well, go in and change,
and we'll talk about it later, all right?
Go ahead. I'll meet you outside.
- All right. - All right. Thank you.
All right, show's over.
Come on, let's go.
- You all right? - Uh, my--
Take your sticks back, would you?
- Hey, I'll see you in there. - Yeah.
- We'll talk, okay? - I'll talk to you soon.
See you soon. I love you.
Line it up again.
Come on, let's go.
I have to go to the hospital and sign some more papers.
Do you wanna see him?
I don't know. Why?
What's he look like?
He looks like he's dead.
I mean, he doesn't look like he's sleeping or anything.
But he doesn't look gross, either.
I don't know.
Well, you know, you don't have to.
I wanted to see him.
Maybe you don't want that image in your memory.
I don't--
It's up to you.
What do you wanna do?
You want me to take you home?
Want me to decide for you?
Let's just go.
What the fuck are you doing?
- I just said let's go inside! - No, you said let's just go,
- and then you get out of the car? - I meant let's go inside.
- What the matter with you? - What's your problem?
- I could have ripped your fuckin' leg off! - Okay, okay!
I'm sorry I misused the English language.
I'm sorry, uncle Lee.
I'm sorry, too. I just get scared.
Yeah, okay, thank you.
Of course.
You gotta hit the bleeper.
I don't have a bleeper.
I'll do it. There's a code.
Hey, is it okay if I invite some of my friends over?
- I told them I would call them. - Go ahead.
And can we get some pizza? 'Cause there's nothing to eat here.
Okay.
- What kind would you like? - Any kind is fine.
Thank you.
At least he didn't suffer.
It's worse for the family, but it's better for the person.
Well, he was a fuckin' great guy, Patrick, I'll tell you that.
That's for sure.
Yeah, I remember this one time he--
he took us out in the boat, like, in sixth grade.
Yeah, I remember that.
He made us wear these life preservers.
And I was like, you know,
"What's the difference, Mr. Chandler?
The boat sinks in this weather, we're dead anyways."
- Yeah, I remember that. - Then he goes,
"The life jacket's to
make it easy on the sharks once you go over."
Fuckin' smartass, I swear to god.
Yeah, he really liked those shark jokes.
- Funny guy. - He was funny, man.
Yeah, he was gentle too, you know?
Like his son.
So there's this former starship captain, all right?
Jesus Christ! With the Star Trek again?
- Will you shut the fuck up? - Fuck you. Star Trek sucks.
- You fuckin' retard. - Star Trek's one of the classical pillars
- of modern entertainment. - Oh, yeah?
Tell me about Star Trek. Enlighten me, motherfucker.
- I'll tell you this-- - How long have I been friends with you?
- How you doing, baby? - I'm okay.
Enough is enough, okay? It's just Star Trek.
How dare you! Will you shut up?
Fuck Star Trek.
Every Sci-Fi classic film you like
- was based on Star Trek. - Star Trek's bullshit.
- Right? Start Trek-- - Star Trek's retarded.
- Then The Road Warrior. - Retarded.
- Then The Matrix. - Retarded and shit.
I love Star Trek!
- Oh, yeah, do you? - How dare you?
Ask Patrick. He loves 'em! He loves 'em!
- Patrick, what do you think? - Go ahead, ask Patrick.
I can't believe we're talking about Star Trek right now.
- I like Star Trek. - Thank you.
Hey, uncle Lee.
Is it okay if Sylvie sleeps over?
Dad always let her.
Then what are you asking me for?
No reason.
Thanks.
Uh, not that it would come up or anything,
but her parents thinks she stays downstairs when she stays over.
So if it comes up for some reason,
can you just say she stayed in the downstairs room?
- I don't even know them. - Yeah, you do.
It's the Mcganns. It's Frank and Pat Mcgann.
- Oh, that's Sylvie Mcgann? - Yeah.
- Okay. - So...
Do you mind saying she stayed downstairs,
like, if they call or something?
Okay.
Am I supposed to tell you to use a condom?
No. I mean--
- Is that what Joe would say? - No.
Well, I mean, yeah, we've had the discussion and everything.
- So... - Yeah, good.
Yeah, just let me know if we're making too much noise.
Okay.
Just fuckin' with you.
All right.
Um, do you think I should call my mom
to tell her about dad?
- No, I wouldn't, Patty. - Yeah.
I mean, uh, nobody even knows where she is.
Yeah.
Yeah, no, I was just curious what you thought.
Anyway, good night, uncle Lee.
Good night.
Are you gonna sulk all night
long because you dropped the goddamn ball?
- I'm not sulking. - Oh, shut up.
If you'd use a goddamn baseball mitt,
you wouldn't drop the fuckin' ball.
I don't need a baseball mitt! I catch better without one.
Hey, shut up. Hey, Elise!
Oh, shit.
Come on. Hey, Lee, you wanna take Patty upstairs
and get him washed up?
- Come on, kid. - Go on, now.
It'll be all right. I'll be up in a minute.
Go on upstairs, Patty. Everything will be okay.
I thought it was wonderful how you dropped that ball.
- Okay. - I didn't want you to catch it.
Oh, shit.
Go on.
Fuck's sake.
Shut the fuck up.
Beverly, Massachusetts, Gallagher funeral home, please.
Morning.
Yes, hi, my name is Lee Chandler.
My brother, Joseph Chandler, is at the Beverly...
Hospital morgue. I'm wondering, uh,
who I need to talk to about making arrangements?
Okay, thank you.
Yes.
Yes, I just spoke--
yes, my name is Lee Chandler.
My brother is at the Beverly hospital morgue.
Yes.
Okay.
I understand, I'm--
I'm calling to find out exactly what I need to do
to make arrangements for the next step.
I see. Okay, thank you.
Can I have a napkin?
Yes.
That's right, so-- but what do I gotta do to get his--
to get his body over the--
Excuse me, Mr. Chandler,
I don't think Patrick needs to be here for this.
Don't-- I'm all right.
I understand. So why is it more
to drive his body to Manchester?
So you gotta take the highway
for seven minutes, that's why it costs more?
Well, what does it cost for the hearse to take 127?
Jesus, like, that's his focus?
Jeez, I'm all right.
Thanks, uncle Lee.
You're welcome.
- Thanks, Mr. Chandler. - You're welcome.
So...
We're gonna forget about the language.
We're gonna forget about the fists.
But I want you to take a few days off of practice.
I don't want you on the ice.
Well, to tell you the honest truth, sir,
I could really use the distraction.
The ice is not a distraction.
When you're on the ice, you gotta be there.
Okay, so take a couple days off,
and we'll talk.
Listen.
When I was your age, I lost my dad, too.
So...
I know what you're-- you're goin' through.
If you want to come in and talk,
or want somebody to spill your guts to,
or throw the bull around,
the door's open.
You mind if I put some music on?
No.
It's at 54--
Do you like these guys?
The lead guitar is weak,
but otherwise they're pretty good.
Oh, they all sound the same to me.
Where are we goin'?
Gotta go to the lawyer.
What for?
To read your father's will.
Do I have to be there?
I don't think so, but I think you're supposed to be.
Who do you think he left the boat to?
I'm sure he left you everything.
I don't understand.
Which, uh, part are you having trouble with?
Well, I can't be the guardian.
I mean, I can't.
Well, naturally, I-- I assumed Joe had
discussed all this with you.
No.
He didn't.
No.
Uh, I-- I--
sorry, I have to say, I'm somewhat taken aback.
He can't live with me. I live in one room.
Well, but Joe has provided for Patrick's upkeep.
Food, clothes, etcetera.
And the house and the boat are owned outright.
I can't commute from Boston every day
until he turns 18.
I think the idea was that you would relocate.
R-- relocate to where?
- Well, you look-- - Here?
Well, as you can see, your brother
worked everything out extremely carefully.
- But he can't have-- - Yes.
He can't have meant that.
Uh, he's allowed up to $5,000
to pay for moving expenses.
And there's, uh-- there's also a small amount
set aside for, uh, you know,
for you to draw from as personal income while you settle in.
I mean, assuming...that you accept.
What about my uncle Donny and aunt Teresa?
Joe didn't feel that Patrick really had any special relationship
- or feeling about them. - I don't understand.
And now, as I think you know,
they've moved out to Wisconsin, I believe.
Minnesota.
- Minnesota. - Minnetonka, Minnesota.
That's right.
It was my impression that you'd spent a lot of time here over the years.
I was just the back up.
I came up here to look after Patty, yeah,
if Joe was in the hospital after my father couldn't do it,
but we--
it was supposed to be Donny.
I'm just the back up.
Well, I-- I can just repeat that I'm-- I'm...
astonished that Joe didn't run this by you,
thorough as he was.
Yeah, 'cause he knew what I would say if he would have asked.
Once! It was once!
Oh, one time nothin'. It's nothin' but one time.
Stay out of this quadrant, and you won't go home in tears.
All right.
You wanna keep it down, you fuckin' morons?
My kids are sleepin'.
I'm so sorry. I am-- I didn't think we were that loud.
Lee. You wanna get these fuckin' pinheads
out of my house, please?
Yeah, I do.
Randi, I really do.
She can't talk to us that way.
Yeah.
I'm not fuckin' around!
It's two o'clock in the fuckin' morning.
Get these fuckin' assholes dressed,
and get 'em the fuck out of here!
We are dressed.
She didn't mean it. She'll apologize later.
Gotta get out of here, man.
- See ya later. - Right on.
Lee.
- Thanks, bro. Take care! - All right!
- Tell Randi we're sorry. - Good night!
- Don't drink and drive. - We're so sorry!
You see Jupiter?
Hold on. Keep your eyes on the road!
Hey, Tommy!
Good night, Joe!
Sorry again!
Go ahead. It's Jupiter, you fuckin' idiot.
Look at, there's the north star right there.
- Right there. - Where?
It's-- it's due north.
I'll clean up in the morning.
You see Jupiter, you fuckin' asshole?
Come on.
Fuck you.
Come on.
Lee.
Lee, nobody can appreciate what you've been through.
If I can say that.
And if you really feel like you can't take this on,
well, that's-- that's--
you know, that's your right.
- Obviously. - So who would get him?
Patrick, can I get you a can of soda or anything?
No, thank you.
Well, I don't know what's happening with Patrick's mother.
- No. - I'm not sure where she is,
- or what kind of condition she's in. - No.
We can't do that.
God, no! Oh, god!
Fred! Fred! My kids are in there!
My kids are in there!
God! Oh, god! I gotta go in there.
Look, Lee.
Why don't you just--
I'm gonna-- I'll be in touch.
Um, I'm here.
Well, we were partying pretty hard.
And there was beer.
And someone was passin' around a joint,
and there was cocaine.
Cocaine?
Yes.
Okay, go ahead.
Uh, anyway, our bedroom is in the downstairs,
and the kids sleep upstairs,
so Randi makes everyone leave around 2:00.
Or 3 A.M.
And then...
She goes back to bed.
So I go upstairs to check on the kids,
and it's fuckin' freezin' upstairs,
but I can't use the central heat
'cause it dries out randi's sinuses,
and gives her really bad headaches.
So I go downstairs and I put a fire in the fireplace,
and sit down and watch TV,
but there's no more beer.
I'm still jumpin' around like... a jackrabbit,
so I put a couple of fire logs in the fire,
and I-- just to warm up the house while I was gone.
And then I-- I'm goin' to the mini mart,
but I'm too wasted and I don't want to drive.
So I walk, it's about 20 minutes each way.
I'm about halfway there,
and I can't remember if I put a screen on the fireplace.
I figure it's okay.
So I just keep goin' to the store.
And, uh, that's it.
Log must have rolled out onto the floor.
Uh, fireman said they pulled Randi out.
She's passed out downstairs.
And, uh--
and then the furnace blew,
and they couldn't go back in again.
And...that's all I remember.
Okay, Lee, that's all for now.
We'll-- we'll call you if anything else comes up
we want to ask you about.
Assuming the forensics bear you out,
which I'm assuming they will.
So, uh, that's it?
Look, Lee, you made a horrible mistake.
Like a million other people did last night.
Not gonna crucify you.
It's not a crime to forget to put the screen on the fireplace.
Well, I mean, you know,
so I can go?
Well, if something comes up we don't already know about,
yeah.
You got anyone to give you a ride back home?
Is Joe here? Is your dad here?
Yeah.
- Sorry. - Okay.
Son!
Put it down. Put it down!
Get on the ground. Get on the ground.
- Ah, please! - Settle down. Settle down.
- We need some cuffs right now. - Stay down.
- Stay down. - Down, down, get him down.
All right, let's go.
Bye.
Where we goin', to the orphanage?
- Shut up. - What the hell did I do?
Just be quiet.
All right, we got a lot to do.
What about the boat?
We can talk to George about it. There's no use hangin' onto it
- if no one's gonna use it. - I'm gonna use it.
- It's gotta be maintained. - I'm maintaining it.
- I'm gonna maintain it. - You can't maintain it by yourself.
Why not? It's my boat now, isn't it?
'Cause you're a minor, you can't take it out alone.
I'm-- I'm the trustee.
- I gotta make the payments-- - What does trustee mean?
I gotta keep up the inspections.
It means I'm in charge of handling everything for you until--
Does that mean you're allowed
- to sell the boat if I don't want you to? - Until you turn 18.
 I don't know.
I'll definitely consider it.
No fuckin' way.
You're so goddamn sure of yourself.
There's no one to run it. You're 16 years old.
I get my license this year.
Doesn't matter, you're still a minor.
You can't run a commercial vessel by yourself.
Meanwhile, it's a big fuckin' expense,
and I'm the one that's gotta manage it,
- and I'm not gonna be here. - Who gives a fuck where you are?
Patty, I swear to god, I'm gonna knock your fuckin' block off.
- Great parenting. - What? What'd you say?
- I said great parenting. - Fuck you!
Mind your fuckin' business, you fuckin' asshole!
You're gonna smash me in the face.
Hey, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
- It's okay, it's okay. - You want me to smash your fuckin' face,
- you fuckin' asshole. - It's okay. It's okay.
Thank you. Thank you. It's okay.
Uncle Lee, are you fundamentally unsound?
Get in the fuckin' car.
Can't obey your orders until you unlock the door.
Shut up.
It's not like the motor's gonna die tomorrow,
but Joe said it keeps breakin' down like a son of a bitch.
Yeah, but we were gonna take a look--
see, there's an allotment of some kind, but--
take a look this weekend.
Things are a little bit up in the air.
No, I-- I can take care of it
as far as the general maintenance is concerned,
but that motor's gonna go at some point.
I'm taking care of it.
There's no allotment for a new motor.
Unless, George, you know someone who wants to buy it.
Wait a second, I'm not selling it.
We're gonna be in Boston, anyway.
What?!
Since when are we supposed to be in Boston?
Just take it easy.
Well, whatever you decide,
it's gonna bleed you dry just sittin' here.
Well, we don't know exactly what we're doin'.
Well, you know, he can always stay with us
if he wants to come up weekends.
Do you want to be his guardian?
- Well, we already-- - He doesn't want to be my guardian,
- for Christ sakes. - We're tryin' to lose some kids at this point.
Have you seen his house?
- Yeah. - No, we're tryin' to work out the logistics,
- so I don't know-- - We're jammed in there pretty good,
- but we-- - Jesus Christ, will you stop?
We've always got a sofa for him any time he wants.
- George-- - You know that, right?
That's all right, I know-- I know that.
- He's welcome any time. - I understand.
I-- I know. Thank you.
Are you brain damaged?
You can't just talk to people like that.
You don't want to be my guardian, that's fine with me.
It's not that, it's just the logistics.
I've just gotta work it all out, I swear.
How? My takin' me to Wonkatonka, Minnesota,
- with uncle Donny? - Minnetonka.
- Minnetonka, Minnesota. - Okay, Minnetonka, Minnesota.
Same difference.
What about my mother?
Huh?
The judge would never let that happen.
- And anyway, no one even knows where she is. - I do.
She's in Connecticut.
At least she was last year.
Since when do you know that?
Well, she emailed me last year,
so I emailed her back.
You know email?
Did your father know you were in touch with her?
Are you kidding?
Can we walk? I'm freezing.
- All I know is-- - I know, I know, I know.
She's a drunk, she's insane,
she let the dog shit on the floor.
It's the last thing that your father
ever would have wanted.
Oh! Oh, like suddenly you care
what he would have wanted.
Where to now?
- The funeral parlor. - Great.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, where are we--
where are we goin'?
He's in Beverly.
There's no funeral homes in Manchester?
Nope.
The cemetery's here.
Let's just get this done.
Down south, we got a lot of snowbirds.
Early in the year, people from the north head down there,
they die down there, they're not from the area.
What do they even like about us?
- Makin' arrangements for a loved one. - Right.
A lot of times, people are comin' in,
- last thing they had on their mind. - Right.
Sometimes I find there's dysfunction in the family still,
somehow people come together. You know?
Dude, what is with that guy
and the big serious and somber act?
I don't know.
No, but seriously, does he not realize
that people know he does this every single day?
I don't know.
Why can't we bury him?
Too cold. The ground is too hard.
They'll bury him in the spring.
So what do they do with him until then?
Put him in a freezer.
Are you serious?
Yes.
That really freaks me out.
It doesn't matter.
Wait a minute.
Wait.
I think I parked the car the other way. Sorry.
What about one of those mini steam shovels?
What?
I once saw one of those mini steam shovels
one time in a graveyard in New Haven.
It's like a perfect little hole in about two seconds.
Well, I don't really know how to get a hold of one
or how much it would cost.
Why can't we just look into it?
Because you can't use heavy equipment
in the historic Rosedale cemetery.
Why not?
Because there are very important people
who are buried there,
and their descendants don't want steam shovels
vibrating over their dead bodies.
Well, why can't we just bury him someplace else?
Because that's the plot that Joe bought.
Don't ask me why.
But if you want to make some other arrangements,
you want to find someplace else to bury him,
you want to talk to the mortician,
and you want to call up Sacred Heart
and talk to father Martin
and find out how much that's gonna cost
and make all those arrangements,
be my guest. Otherwise, let's just leave it.
I just don't like him being in a freezer.
Yeah.
I don't like it, either,
but it isn't him because he's gone.
It's just his body.
I'm just saying it kind of freaks me out.
Oh, god damn it, where did I park the car?
Yeah, I don't know, but I wish you'd figure it out
because I'm freezing my ass off.
You don't have a normal winter coat?
- Huh? - Yeah. Yeah, I do.
Why don't you wear gloves with the real fingers on them?
Oh, god, fuck.
Oh, fuck, where did I park this motherfucking car?
God damn, it's cold.
Why? What's the matter with your winter jacket?
- Seriously, Patty? - Just turn the heat on.
It's on already.
Well, turn it up a little.
It's all the way up.
It's blowing freezing air on me.
It just needs a minute to warm up.
What year did you get this thing, 1928?
Where's the horse that goes with this fucking car?
Maybe he can breathe on us.
Patty, I swear to god.
I know. Why don't we keep my dad in here
for the next three months?
We'd save a fucking fortune.
Would you shut the fuck up about the freezer?
Want me to have a nervous breakdown
because there's undertakers and a funeral?
- Who cares? - No. I don't.
Okay, it's getting warmer.
I got band practice. Can you drive me home
so I can get my stuff
and take me over to my girlfriend's house?
Sure.
This the same girl who was over at the house?
No. That was Sylvie, and this is Sandy.
They don't know about each other,
so, uh, please don't say anything
in case it comes up.
I won't.
Do you actually have sex with these girls?
We don't just play computer games.
With both of them?
Well, with Sandy's mom here,
it's sort of, uh, strictly just like basement business.
What does that mean?
It means I'm working on it.
Stop. Otto, man, what are you doing?
What did I do?
You're way behind, man.
No, I'm not.
You're a little behind, Otto.
You got to start with the bass, Otto.
Come on, man, just stay with me, all right?
- Let's go. - All right, I'm sorry.
All right. Yeah. Come on.
It's all right.
Come on, let's go.
- All right, guys. - Let's go again.
Otto, you good?
- You good, buddy? - Let's go, baby.
Let me ask stentorian.
1, 2, 3.
Hi. Are you Lee?
I'm Jill, Sandy's mom.
I think they're wrapping up.
You want to come inside and have a beer or something?
It's all right. Thank you.
I wanted to offer my condolences about Joe.
He was a terrific guy.
There's not too many like him.
He was a wonderful father.
Thank you.
I was-- I was going to ask Patrick
if he wants to stay for supper,
if that's okay with you.
You want to join us? I made way too much.
That's all right.
I'll just come back and get him.
What time should I come back?
Oh, I don't know. 9, 9:30.
They're going to do their homework together, supposedly.
All right. I'll come back at 9:30.
Okay. When you change your mind in the next ten minutes,
we're right inside.
Okay. Thanks.
Jesus Christ, how do you unbuckle this?
I'm scraping the skin off my knuckles.
Hold on. Just take your hand out.
Would you please just take your hand out of my cunt?
Okay. Okay.
Oh, are we taking our pants off?
I'm taking my pants off.
I don't know what you're doing.
I'm taking my pants off.
Come on.
You got to take your shoe off first.
- Jesus. - I'm-- I'm trying.
Hey, kids, come on, have some dinner.
Thanks, mom. We'll be right down.
Thanks, Jill. One second.
I just got to log off.
Would you shut up? She's not retarded.
Why are you picking on me?
I'm not picking on you.
You'll get me in trouble.
We're not gonna get in trouble.
We are.
I can't believe what you're gonna do.
How's the math homework?
It's good.
Very frustrating.
Good.
Those algorithms are a bitch.
This is really good, Jill.
- Thank you, Patrick. - Is this a--
this is a homemade carbonara sauce?
Jesus, shut up.
No.
You could have fooled me.
Jesus.
What? What?
You're such a kiss-ass.
- Sandy! - What,
because I appreciate your mother's cooking?
- Good night. - Good night.
Aren't you going to ask what happened?
- I don't want to know. - Guess not.
{\an9}2:2
Come on.
Hello.
Hello. Lee?
It's Randi.
- Hello? - Yeah. Sorry. I'm here.
- Hi. How are you? - Okay. How are you?
- Good. - Good.
I was just calling--
George told me about Joe,
and I just wanted to call and say I'm sorry.
I hope you don't mind me calling.
No. It's fine. Thank you.
I don't mind. How are you?
Not so good right now.
I guess we should have seen it coming,
but it's still hard to believe.
- Yeah. - Yeah.
- How's Patrick doing? - He's good.
Beyond the obvious, obviously.
He's okay. He's fine. I don't know.
You know how kids are. It's hard to tell.
He doesn't really open up with me,
but he seems fine. He's got a lot of friends.
- Oh, well, that's good. - Yeah, it is.
So I don't know if you'd planned a service yet,
but I was also going to ask, if you wouldn't mind,
I'd like to be there if it's okay with you.
Yeah, it's fine. I don't mind.
Okay, okay. Thank you.
It would mean a lot to me.
No, you should come.
I'll let you know when it's going to be.
Thank you.
So can I ask, uh...
How are you?
I don't know. How are you?
I don't know.
We're doing pretty well.
I should probably tell you.
I'm going to be a--
actually, I'm-- I'm pregnant.
- Oh, yeah? - Yeah.
You know, like, ready to pop.
Oh, I didn't know that.
Uh, I didn't know if I should tell you,
but...
No, it's fine. Congratulations.
Thank you. You would probably decide it for yourself
when you see me.
Yeah.
So, uh, you know,
I just wanted to say, you know--
actually, uh, I-- oh, sorry.
I didn't mean to cut you off. I just got to go.
I just wanted to make sure it's okay
if me and Josh come to the funeral.
- It's totally okay. - Thank you, Lee.
Okay. God bless.
- So long. - Bye.
Are you kidding me? I've never even been to Boston.
So how are you holding up?
What's the matter?
I said how are you holding up?
It's a stupid question. Get some food?
Oh, uh, I had some cheese.
You had some cheese, asshole?
I'll get you something.
- I don't want anything. - Hey, Janine!
- Sure? - What?
- I don't want anything. - Never mind.
- What? - Forget it. Skip it.
I can't hear a goddamn word you're saying.
What?
Did Lee get food?
He didn't-- what?
Did Lee get food?
No! He doesn't want any.
- We're good. - I'll make him a plate.
Forget it. He doesn't--
We're fine.
He doesn't want any--
Hey, is it okay if I invite Sylvie over?
Which one is she?
She's the one with the... The brown hair.
No.
What do you mean, no?
I don't like her.
I don't want her in the house right now.
Why not? You don't even have to talk to her.
Sorry. Go to her house or call one of your friends.
That's that.
Would it be cool with your mom if I came over there?
I have no idea.
Okay. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Well, I can't stay there, either.
Sorry about that.
You going to stay in here?
Yeah. Why not?
I thought maybe you'd want to stay in dad's room.
Hmm? Why, do you want me to?
No. It's just a better room.
And he's not using it.
Okay. I'll stay in there.
We're not gonna be here that much longer anyway.
We're not moving to Boston, uncle Lee.
Well, I don't want to talk about that right now.
You said he left you money so you could move.
Yeah. That doesn't mean--
Anyway, what's in Boston?
You're a janitor.
- So what? - You can do that anywhere.
There's plenty of toilets
and clogged-up drains all over town.
- I don't want to-- - All my friends are here.
I'm on the hockey team.
I'm on the basketball team.
I got to maintain our boat now.
I work on George's boat two days a week.
I got two girlfriends,
and I'm in a band.
You're a janitor in Quincy.
What the hell do you care where you live?
I got to go to sleep.
Good night.
Where are you going to stay tonight?
I don't know. A motel.
What time you going to call me?
When I get to the motel.
I want to hear from you by 9:00,
or I'm going to call the cops.
- Understand? - Yes. Yes.
Patrick, come say goodbye to your uncle Lee!
- It's okay. - No, it's not.
Patrick!
Coming!
I'm going to see him.
Bye, uncle Lee.
So long.
Patty?
I think there's something wrong with me.
What do you mean? Like what? Are you sick?
I don't know!
- I feel really weird! - Are you sick?
I think I'm havin' a panic attack.
What do you mean? Hey.
I don't know, I mean...
Could you get that shit outta here, please?
Get rid of what?
I don't know, I don't know!
The food?
You want me to get rid of the food?
Patrick? Hey.
Do you want me to take you to the hospital?
No. I don't know.
Do you want me to call your friends?
- I don't know. - What do you want me to do?
Patty, are you going to bed?
Leave me alone.
I don't think I should let you keep the door shut.
Just go away.
I will. Just open up the door.
Fuck you.
Jesus Christ, what's your problem?
I said open up the door. Are you havin' a breakdown?
Shall we take you to the hospital?
No! No! No!
I'm just freakin' out.
Okay, fine, but I can't let you freak out with the door closed.
And if you're gonna freak out every time
you see a frozen chicken I think we should go to the hospital.
I don't know anything about this.
I just don't like him bein' in the freezer!
You've expressed that very clearly.
I don't like it either.
There's nothin' we can do about it.
I'm not gonna bother you. I'm just gonna sit here
until you calm down.
All right, I'm calmer now.
Can you please just go away?
No.
Cool!
How much are they payin' you?
Minimum wage plus the room.
All right.
Let's go get some furniture.
I got furniture.
No, you don't.
This doesn't count as furniture.
This is not a room.
Let's go get some furniture
Get off my back.
Patty, come on. Let's go.
Let's go.
There we go.
All right.
Better?
Better.
So, listen.
We can stay here until your school lets out.
Okay?
That'll give me time to set things up in Boston better.
Maybe you can do some stuff with George in the summer
if you want, and you don't get jerked
out of your life overnight.
Okay?
Are you askin' me or tellin' me?
I'm tellin' you that's the best I can do.
{\an9}Then what the fuck do you care whether it's okay with me or not?
It's 45 minutes away.
You can come back here any time you want.
{\an9}From Quincy?
Yeah.
It's an hour and a-- is that a joke?
It's an hour and a half at least!
- No, it's not. - You gotta include the other cars!
You couldn't get from here to Roxbury in half an hour
if you flew in a fuckin' spaceship!
Okay, fuck it.
I need lunch money.
- Hey, Patrick! - Hey, Patrick!
- Hey, Patrick! - Patrick! Patrick!
So, are you going to godspell?
I'm thinking about it.
All right, 'Kay. Bye.
Those your girlfriends, too?
They wish.
Doesn't George give you money for working on his boat?
Yeah, but I'm savin' that.
- For what? - New motor.
You going to godspell?
Aw, come on.
Aw, come on!
Hello.
Hello, Lee?
Lee?
Lee, is that you?
Hello?
What happened to your hand?
I cut it.
Oh. For a minute there I didn't know what happened.
Is there some reason why you didn't tell me
my mom tried to call me?
She wrote me you hung up on her.
She's in Essex.
She wants me to come have lunch and meet her fiance.
What'd you think?
She couldn't get in touch with me?
I hung up on her because I didn't know what to say to her.
And I didn't tell you because
'cause I didn't know what to say to you.
I'm sorry.
You can't stop me talkin' to her.
I don't give a shit what you do.
No, but you won't let my girlfriend stay over,
you hate my mother so much you won't even tell me she called.
You'd rather drag me back to Quincy and ruin my life
than let somebody else be my guardian--
There is nobody else.
I can live in Essex with my mom.
No, you can't.
She's not an alcoholic anymore
and she wants me to stay with her,
then that solves all our problems.
I can take the same bus to my same school
and keep all my friends,
and the boat, and you can go back to Boston,
and still check in on me, or whatever, if you want to...
I can't do that.
Why not?
Patty, I'm sorry I hung up on her.
I'll call her back,
and if she seems semi-human to me,
you can go have lunch with her and her fiance.
That's it.
I don't wanna talk about this anymore.
Okay, soon as we're clear,
open it up and we'll see what we can do.
Okay.
Lee?
Hey, what do you say?
- How are you? - Yeah, I'm good. How are you?
All right.
I'm really, uh-- I'm really sorry to hear about Joe.
I know, yeah, thanks.
How's Patrick doing?
- Good. - Yeah?
- Yeah. - Good.
What's going on? What are ya--
You know, I'm back,
I'm thinking about staying through the summer.
I was wondering if you had any work.
I'm looking to pick up some hours.
Sure, sure.
Walt is down in Boston, so...
- Oh, he is? - Yeah, he should be back tomorrow
- if you want to come by. - He's coming back up tomorrow?
Yeah, yeah. Give him a call.
Okay. I will give him a call.
- That's a good idea. - I'll do that.
- Absolutely. - Okay. All right.
- All right. - Good to see you.
- Thanks, Jerry. - All right.
I don't want to see him in here again.
Bye, Patrick.
Want to watch the football game on Sunday?
- Sure. - So long, Patrick.
- Bye, Patrick. - See you guys.
How's the motor?
George says the piston's gonna go right
through the block any minute now.
Unfortunately that's a problem.
We can't afford to keep a boat if we can't run it,
and we can't run it if it's got a broken motor.
Let's take out a loan.
And pay it back with what?
We hire it out 'til we pay the loan back, obviously.
Unfortunately for you,
I'm in charge of your finances until you turn 21,
and I'm not comfortable takin' out enormous loans on your behalf.
I have band practice.
Can you drive me home to get my stuff
then drive me over to Sandy's house?
Sure.
Why don't you take a drivers'ed course? I'm not your chauffeur.
'Cause dad made me promise not to drive 'til I was 17.
Okay, we'll stick with that then.
Do you wanna stay for dinner?
I think Sandy's mother likes you.
No, she doesn't.
I happen to know that she does.
This could be good for both of us.
I'd really rather not.
Well, can you at least just like hang out with her for half an hour
so I can be alone with Sandy
without her mother knockin' on the door every twenty seconds?
Come on, man.
All you gotta do is talk to her.
Why can't you help me out a little bit for once
instead of draggin' me to the lawyers
and the funeral parlor and the morgue?
Anyway, she's really nice.
Tell me why
Why
Why do you need me
Why do you want me
- Stop, stop, stop, stop. Stop, stop. - Why do you love me
- Otto... - What, I'm too slow?
Too fast man. You're dragging.
You're way too fast, man.
I'm too fast.
Dude, you're like pulling out of the fucking station ahead of me.
Oh my god, you guys, leave him alone.
Dude, like, are you serious about this band, or what?
Okay, all right, all right.
- Just lay off him. - Get off my back.
All right, everybody just chill here.
Let's just, um...let's just go again.
We are Stentorian.
Patrick is one of my favorite people.
That's good.
How's it goin' up there, you guys?
It's going...it's going fine, thanks!
But we're right in the middle of something.
We're just banging out those compound fractions.
At least we know where they are, right?
That's true.
How many of those you generally gotta go through
before you pick a winner?
I'd like to see you use one of these goddamn things
with all these interruptions.
Oh, fuck me!
What happened? Are you ok?
I tripped over your fuckin' doll house.
Oh my god, did you break it?
I don't know. I'm fine though, by the way.
Oh my god.
My grandmother gave me that when I was five years old.
It was literally her doll house from when she was a little girl.
Then what's it doin' on the fuckin' floor?
It's a doll house, that's where you play with it!
Kids, what is going on up there?
Nothing! Patrick just stubbed his toe on mummer's doll house,
but it's okay!
Sandy, that doll house belonged to my mother.
- Yes I know, mom. - If you're gonna smash it to pieces...
Nobody is smashin' it to pieces! It's fine!
Don't worry, Jill, I'm okay.
My toe's gonna be okay.
Do you want to fuck me or not?
Yes.
Could I get you another beer, Lee?
I'm good. Thank you.
Would you excuse me, Lee, one sec?
Sure.
- Is it on? - Yes. It's a miracle.
Okay, hurry up.
One second please!
Get outta my way!
I'm sorry.
What's up?
I'm really sorry, I know you're trying to work,
but I can't sit down there much longer.
Why? What's the problem?
He won't talk.
I've been trying to make conversation for half an hour.
- I realize I'm not ... - Are you serious?
What's the matter?
- the most fascinating person in the world-- - Mom!
But it's very, very strained.
- What's going on? - She can't get your uncle to talk.
He likes sports.
I'm sorry to bust things up,
but how much longer do you think you're gonna be?
Could you maybe turn on a game?
- I'm sorry. - Shut up.
Mummy, please.
You were a tremendous help.
I didn't ask to sit down there.
You can't make small talk like every other grown up in the world?
- No. - You can't talk about boring bullshit for half an hour?
- No. - Hey, how about those interest rates?
- No, I can't. - Hey, I lost my triple A card.
- Nope. - Like everybody else?
Nope, sorry.
You're a fucking asshole.
Where'd you say she lives?
'Cause there's, like, no houses here. None.
What, does she live in a fucking sleeping bag?
119 pigeon hill street.
Pigeon hill street, or pigeon hill road?
- Pigeon hill street - Okay, pigeon hill street.
- Pigeon hill court. - Street.
- Pigeon hill road. - Street.
- Fine, pigeon hill-- - Pigeon hill street.
- This is pigeon hill road. - Okay.
You have no GPS whatsoever?
No, I have a little fucking cartoon.
- You want me to punch it in for you? - No, I don't.
I've got it, thank you.
Okay, listen.
Are you nervous?
Yeah, I'm nervous.
What are you, a fuckin' genius?
Okay, skip it.
Just want you to text me if anything gets weird.
Okay. Thank you.
Oh my gosh. Is that my Patrick?
Hi, mom.
I'm so happy.
Come in. Welcome to my home.
Patrick. This is my fella.
Jeffrey, this is Patrick...
Great to finally meet you, Patrick.
- Nice to meet you. - Yeah.
And this is Lee.
Hey, welcome.
- Thanks. - Jeffrey.
Lee.
Now, Lee, are you sure you can't stay for lunch?
I'm positive. Yeah.
All right.
Come, come.
Oh, are you sure-- I can't help you--
No thanks, honey.
Your job is to relax.
That is your number one assignment, okay?
Okay, all right. I'm really gonna apply myself.
No, I was just joking.
I know you were. So was I.
How we gettin' along?
- Great. - Great.
You don't have to be so polite, you know.
I'm not being polite.
Did you wanna wash your hands before we eat?
Yes.
For what we are about to receive, let us give thanks.
- Amen. - Amen.
You can say "Amen", Patrick.
Nobody's tryin' to recruit you.
I did say "Amen".
Oh, you did? Okay.
Well, you don't have to.
Yeah, I know. I just said it really quietly.
It's fine, honey.
Look, I know I'm gonna be a shock to you.
In a lot of ways.
I'm hoping it's a good shock.
Yeah.
You need anything else, Patrick?
I hope everything's okay.
Oh yeah, everything's great.
You don't have to be so formal.
I'm not.
I think your mother wants you to feel--
I'm just sayin' that this is your home, too.
I want it to be.
And I know...
I know, uh...
Things are different for you.
Anyway, I don't know.
That's okay.
What are you studying at school, Patrick?
Oh, well, the usual stuff.
You know what? I'm gonna be right back.
Does anybody need anything from the kitchen?
- No, thanks. Thank you. - I'm good, no.
Did you get some string beans?
Oh, no, not yet. Thank you.
Let me, um...
Let me just see what she's doin' in there.
So what was she like?
I don't know. She was pretty nervous.
Yeah?
What was that guy like?
He was very Christian.
You know, we're Christian, too, right?
Yes, I know that.
You are aware that catholics are christians?
Yes, I am aware of that.
Well, it sounds like she's doing better, anyway.
She's not drinking.
She's not in the psych ward.
Wow, what?
You'll do anything to get rid of me.
- What? - You heard me.
That's not true.
Dear Patrick,
I'm writing to thank you for today.
Your visit meant the world to your mom.
We are both deeply grateful for the love and trust
you've shown by offering to rejoin her life,
but I feel it would be unfair to your mom to rush her along
the long and challenging road ahead,
and so I'm going to ask you to write to me
in future to arrange any further visits.
I hope you won't take this as an intrusion--
where are your friends tonight?
I don't know.
Why don't you call that girl Sandy,
- see if she'll come over? - No, thanks.
Nice try, though.
Who are you going to shoot, you or me?
Do you know what these things are worth?
No.
Want to try and sell them
so you can have a motor for the boat?
That's a really good idea.
This is awesome.
This is awesome.
Do you want to drive?
Sure.
All right.
Oh! Oh, my god!
- I'm so sorry. - That's all right.
That's all right. That's all right. Just straighten her out.
- Oh, my god. - Straighten her out.
- That's okay. - Sorry.
Hey, I got to run some chores.
I'll be back in a couple hours.
- You want anything? - No, thank you.
No, thanks, Mr. Chandler.
Thank you.
Set-up city.
What are you talking about?
Oh, yeah? How Sylvie McGann?
Who?
Just open the door.
I didn't think it was our responsibility, but--
Yeah, I guess. I mean, they could have--
it's okay.
Lee.
Hi.
Hi.
Rachel, this is Lee.
- Hello. - Lee, this is Rachel.
And this is Dylan.
You can't see him too good.
Hi, Dylan.
Very handsome.
Randi, you want me to get the car and pick you up?
- Yeah. - That's okay. I got to go.
Actually, could-- could we, uh,
could we talk for a second?
- Sure. - Okay.
I'll just pull around. Just be a few minutes.
- Okay. Thanks. - Nice to meet you.
- Yeah. You, too. - Be right back.
I don't have anything big to say.
That's okay.
I just--
I know you've been around, and I--
I've just been getting Patrick settled in.
It seems like he's doing pretty good, huh?
Considering.
I think he is, yeah.
I guess you don't know this,
but I, uh...
I really kept in touch with Joe.
- No, I knew that. - It's been kind of weird
for me not seeing Patrick. Oh. Oh, okay.
I-- I didn't know.
Uh, you could see him if you want.
Could we ever have lunch?
You mean us, you and me?
Yeah.
Because I, uh...
I said a lot of terrible things to you.
No.
But I--
I know you never--
maybe you don't want to talk to me.
- It's not that. - Let me finish.
However--
my heart was broken.
It's always going to be broken.
And I know yours is broken, too.
But I don't have to carry--
I said things that--
I should fucking burn in hell for what I said to you.
No. No.
- It was-- - no, no, no, no.
Randi, no.
I'm just sorry.
It-- I-- I can't ex-- I can't--
I love you.
Maybe I shouldn't say that.
No, you can say that.
It's just--
I'm sorry. I've got to go.
We couldn't have lunch?
I'm really sorry. I don't think so.
I thank you for saying everything you said.
You can't just die.
I'm not. I'm not. I'm not.
But, honey-- honey--
And I-- I want you to be happy.
Honey, I see you walking around here,
and I just want to tell you--
I would want to talk to you, Randi,
- But, Lee-- - Please, I-- I-- I--
because-- I--
- Lee-- - Um, I'm--
- I'm trying to-- - Lee, you've got to--
I don't know what--
Look, this is not--
I don't want to torture you.
You're not torturing me.
I just want to tell you
that I was wrong.
No. No.
You don't understand. There's nothing--
there's nothing there.
- There's nothing there. - That's not true.
- That's not true. - Let me say this.
You don't understand.
- I understand you. - I don't know what to--
I know you understand me.
I-- I-- I've got to go.
- Don't. - I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Corner pocket.
- Pardon me. - It's all right.
Shit.
Did you see that?
You want to hit us? Want to hit us?
- God damn it! - Come on, you little bastard!
Look out, look out, look out.
Look out, look out, look out!
Get off him! Break it up!
Back off, George!
- Fuck him! - George, get out of here!
- Break him up! - George!
Get him out of here, George!
He's Joey Chandler's brother.
- Back off, back off. - Fucking dude--
- Oh, fuck-- - Hey, settle down.
Fuck him! Fuck him!
- He's a fucking douche bag! - Settle down.
Settle down. You won, all right?
Fuck that motherfucker.
- Settle down. - Okay, brother.
- You good? - You won, all right?
- Are we cool? - Fuck him.
Fuck him!
Come here. Get off.
- Get off. Get off. - Leave him--
- Fuck you! - Get the fuck off. Get him--
Should he go to the hospital?
I don't think so. Nothing's broken.
What did they fucking hit him with,
a baseball bat?
They all just said he started swinging.
Where's Patrick?
He's with the kids.
I sent them out for burgers.
No, no, no, no.
- Lee, sit down. - Sit down.
Sit down. It's all right.
- Let me give you some money. - Lee, please, I got it.
- I'll give you some money. - Put that away.
- Please, no. I got it. - Put your money away.
- Come on. - I got it.
I got it. It's on me.
I made you some coffee. Come on. Drink this.
- Come on. - Come on.
Come on, buddy.
Just have a little.
It's all right.
I'm going to get you some ice for your face, okay?
It's all right.
Can I get you anything, uncle Lee?
Oh, no, thanks, buddy.
All right. I'm going to go to bed.
- Good night. - Good night.
Thomas.
Drives to the basket, gets two.
That's what you want.
Daddy.
Daddy.
Yes, honey?
Can't you see we're burning?
No, honey. You're not burning.
Fire. Fire.
Uncle Lee, what-- what is that smell?
I just burned the sauce. Everything's okay.
Yeah.
I got a job in Boston. Starts in July.
What is it?
Custodian, handyman.
But it's just two buildings this time, so...
And what, uh, delightful Boston neighborhood
have you selected for us to live in?
- None. - What do you mean?
You don't have to move to Boston.
I want to be in Charlestown,
and George is going to take you.
What?
I talked to him last week
and explained the situation to him.
Georgie Junior's going to BU in the fall,
and Jimmy graduates next year.
We can rent this house out until you turn 18.
Then you come back and stay if you want.
When you turn 21, you're allowed to sell it
or keep it or whatever you want to do.
We definitely have to hire out the boat when summer's over.
Just like we talked about.
When you get your license,
then we can-- we can just figure that out
when it happens.
I'm still the trustee.
But all the financial stuff that Joe set up for me
is going to get transferred over to George.
So basically everything's staying the same,
except you don't have to move.
Thank you, but, like, who's--
Are they going to be my guardians, or are you going--
They're going to adopt you.
Anyway, that's just how I set it up.
You don't have to. It's up to you.
So you're just going to disappear?
No.
No.
I set it up this way so you could stay here.
And they're really glad to have you.
- They-- - I know, I know.
I mean, they're great, but...
Why can't you stay?
Come on, Patty.
I can't beat it.
I can't beat it.
I'm sorry.
What do you think?
It's going to be okay.
Are you one of Stan Chandler's boys?
Yeah. I'm Lee.
I used to play chess with your father a long time ago.
He was a excellent chess player.
That's him.
He's not still living, is he?
No.
One of the sons
passed away recently, I heard.
Uh, yeah, my brother Joe.
Very personable man.
Yeah.
My father passed away in 1959.
A young man.
He worked on a tuna boat.
He got up one morning.
Some weather, nothing dramatic.
And he never returned.
No signals, no maydays.
No one ever found out what happened to him.
I'm going to get some ice cream.
Go ahead.
Can I have some money?
Yes.
So when am I supposed to move in with Georgie?
July.
I don't even have a place to live yet.
They don't give you an apartment?
Yeah, but I'm looking for one with an extra room.
A room for a pull-out sofa or--
What for?
So you can come visit some time.
Or if you want to look at colleges in Boston,
you could stay overnight.
I'm not going to college.
All right, then I'll have an extra room for all my shit.
Do we have to talk about this now?
No.
Great throw.
Just let it go.
Heads up.
