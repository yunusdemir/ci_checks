summer day in Chicago today.</i>

reported from Happy Poultry Farms.</i>

- Ahem.
Rise and shine.
- Morning, Mum.
- How's the book going?
Good. Yeah, I've been working
really hard on it.
Rewriting it. It's a first draught,
you know. Did you get a chance
- to read the manuscript?
- I did and I loved it.
- Oh. Any thoughts? Criticisms?
- No, I thought it was wonderful.
I won't become a better writer if I don't
get constructive criticism. Please.
- I'm begging you.
- Well,
um, I did think the characters
were a tiny bit unlikeable.
- That's more like it. Noted.
- And it was a little slow.
I found myself a little bored,
to be honest.
- And I heart honesty.
- I also didn't know what was going on
or where we were.
It wasn't explained well.
I couldn't figure out the plot.
It was kind of insulting.
And there was no specificity
in terms of time and place.
- And where was the inciting incident?
- OK, OK, this is... Wow.
Thank you, heh.
But mostly I loved it.
Now, get up and teach those summer
school kids how to write like you.
Chapter one. The boat was evil,
but he loved the boat.
Chapter one. The boat was evil,
but he didn't know just how evil.
The boat was evil,
but it was an acceptable level of evil.
Chapter one. The sea-faring vessel,
<i>The Schooner,</i> was evil.
Ah. It's getting there.
Jesus. I've come full circle.
How very, very utterly depressing.
What's up, amigo? Hey.
- You're not my dealer.
- No, I'm Clint...
- Hey, you don't sell shrooms do you?
- No. I'm Clint Hadson.
<font color="#80FF00">(MAN OVER RADIO)</font> <i>Is that Hudson?</i>
- Hadson.
- Yeah, it's him. I'll let him in.

Thanks for coming

Mrs. Kenner is down with the flu,
or maybe she's pregnant.
She is Mormon, so that's a possibility.
I'm vice principal Simms.
Principal Hodges is in the Bahamas.
You know what they say.
When the cat's away, the vice principal
becomes acting principal.
I forgot they say that.

Teacher's lounge is across the way.
Go get a cup of joe.
It's not strong enough for my taste.
To deal with these terrors I need
the high-octane stuff. Isn't that right?
Heh, she's hilarious.
A lot of personal tragedy.
Come on in to this office.
Pull up a ball chair.
Got a cell phone?
Um, yeah.
- I'm gonna have to take it.
- Are you serious?
Yep. This is a no cell-phone campus.
We can't ask the kids to give up
something we're not willing to.
So hand over that crackberry.
Booyah. Now, I gotta warn you,
I run a pretty tight ship.
Yeah, I'm fine with that.
Heh, it's funny you should say that.
I'm actually writing a book about a ship.
Well, it's more of a boat.
I have it with me.
If you're asking me to describe
my pedagogical "philosophy".
- I'm not.
- Some charter schools out of Boston
are "absolutely" "revolutionising"
"education."
I'm not sure you know
how air quotes work.
I wanna bring these kids back
to a pre-digital era.
No cell phones, and I don't care
if it's raining labradoodles,
I wanna get those kids outside
during recess.
Heck, I'll lock them out.
And I will do that.
Now, here's a map of the school.
Mrs. Kenner is in Room 12.
Oh, I don't need that.
I actually used to go here. Class of '88.
Hey, you know what that is?
That's out of sight.
- All right.
- Shouldn't joke about guns though.
- No.
- Not in a school.
- Yeah.
- That's not funny.
My partner's name is David.
He is awesome.
He's a little bit older,
but really has this amazing body.
If I'm being completely honest,
he does have these fantastic balls
that I just love to play with.
They're firmer and fuzzier, so...
Heh, tennis partner.
Heh, David's my tennis partner. Heh.
Hi there. Um, you know which
one of these is Mrs. Kenner's?
Buddy, I don't know
what that bitch drinks out of.
Here's what I do know.
I know that this is a rape button.
It emits a shit-crazy alarm
that will inform local police,
who'll arrive within two minutes should
you decide to get touchy and/or feely.
Wanna know why I have a rape button?
Don't answer.
Because the State of Illinois
doesn't trust the citizenry enough
to pass safe, sensible,
conceal and carry laws.
OK.
So any of these then?

Yeah.
Uh, Wade, have you met Clint?
I have not. Wade Johnson. Pleased
to meet you with meat to please you.
Actually, we kind of met earlier.
You parked me in.
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. It's... It's fine.
It's just that, um, you parked so close
that I couldn't get out of my car.
My truck's got a dual real wheel.
- I'm sorry?
- Dual real wheel.
Dual real... Dual real...
Dual real real. Dual real...

It's got a dual real wheel.

It's got two extra wheels
on the back part of it.
Dual rear...
So, Clint, heard tell you were a writer,
hmm?
- What have you written?
- Ah. Nothing that you've read, yet.
I'm actually working on
my first novel.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Oh, yeah, well, that's actually
why I'm home.
You know, just to hunker down

But, uh, I need a few shekels.

- Hebrew for...
- Doug.

- Wow. Good for you. That's so exciting.
- Thanks.
What's it about?
Oh. Uh, well, it's a horror novel.
Um, it's about a guy who buys a boat,
but the boat turns out
to be possessed.
Like <i>Christine.</i>
- I'm sorry?
- <i>Christine</i> by Stephen King.
The guy buys a car
and it's possessed.
- Um, but this is about a boat.
- So it's like <i>Speed 2?</i>

My uncle's cancer

But his divorce

That was my weekend.
Let's begin class.
Maybe we were created

to die for us,
or maybe we were monkey people
who sat around
crapping in each other's mouths

"I don't like all this hair.
Just on my head and crotch, please."
Who can say?
I can't, because the State of Illinois
doesn't allow me to, Hank.
I know I'm the substitute,
but I'm also a friend.
It wasn't so long ago that
I was sitting exactly where you are.
In fact,
don't tell those other teachers,
but I want you to call me
by my first name.
- "Cunt"?
- What?
No. You can't say...
OK, no. Uh, my name is Clint.
You know what?
Just call me Mr. Hadson.
I'm not really a teacher.
I'm only substituting to pay the bills.
I'm actually writing a horror novel.

Yeah, real cool, asshole.

I was born on September 11th.

That's why on my 18th birthday,
I'm joining the Marines
just to kick some towel-head ass.
Wow. A lot to unpack there.
First off, could you keep
the language down, please?
Otherwise, I'll send you outside.
Yeah, while you were talking,
I just looked at like a hundred vaginas.
- All right. Give me that.
- Why?
You're not allowed to have it.
Your principal told me.
How about I start crying
and suggest to my parents
about how you touched me
inappropriately?
Wait. You didn't happen to write
on a Prius this morning, did you?
OK. So I actually have the first
draught of my new novel with me.
Who would like to come up here

And then you guys can
give me some notes.
