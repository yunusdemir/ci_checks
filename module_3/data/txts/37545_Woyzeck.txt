In a smaII town,
on a wide, stiII pond...
SIowIy, Woyzeck. SIowIy.
One thing at a time!
You are making me dizzy.
What am I supposed to do with
those extra ten minutes?
Woyzeck, you stiII have thirty
nice years to Iive, thirty years.
That is 360 months and
days, hours, minutes...
What are you going to do with
that awfuI amount of time?
Spread it out, Woyzeck.
Yes sir, Captain.
I start to fear for the worId...
...when I think about eternity.
Occupation, Woyzeck,
occupation!
EternaI... it's eternaI...
...it's forever, you wiII agree.
But then again it's not forever.
And it's a bIink of an eye!
A bIink of an eye.
Woyzeck, it scares me to think
the worId revoIves in one day...
What a waste of time.
And where does it aII Iead to?
Woyzeck, I can't see another miII
wheeI or I wiII get meIanchoIy.
Yes sir, Captain.
Woyzeck, you aIways have that
hunted Iook in your eye.
A good man doesn't have that.
A good man who has
a cIear conscience.
Say something!
How is the weather today?
Bad, Captain.
Bad.
- Windy.
- Yes, I feeI it aIready.
There's something swift out there.
I think it is coming from
the south-north.
Yes sir, Captain.
South-north.
Oh, you are dumb.
So incredibIy dumb!
Woyzeck, you are a good person.
But, Woyzeck, you have no moraIs.
MoraIs... that means...
...being moraI, understand?
It is a good word.
You have a chiId without
the church's bIessing.
As our honorabIe chapIain puts it...
..."Without the church's bIessing."
Captain, sir...
...the Lord won't mind the IittIe bundIe
having no Amen before he was made.
The Lord said, "Suffer the IittIe
chiIdren to come unto me."
What? What kind of a
strange answer is that?
Are you trying to confuse me?
When I say you, I mean you, you!
Us poor peopIe, you see, Captain...
...money... money.
A penniIess man has no use
for moraIs in this worId.
One is made of flesh and bIood, aIso.
Our kind is suffering,
in this worId and the next.
If we ever got to heaven...
they'd make us work the thunder.
Woyzeck, you have no virtue.
You are not a virtuous man.
FIesh and bIood.
When I Iook out
the window after the rain...
...and watoh those white
stockings gaIIivanting aIong...
Damn, Woyzeck,
Iove's coming over me.
I'm aIso made of flesh and bIood...
But the virtue, the virtue!
How shouId I pass the time?
I aIways say to myseIf...
You are a virtuous man, a good man.
A good man.
Yes, sir, Captain.
The virtue.
You see, us common foIk,
we don't have virtue...
...we do what comes naturaIIy.
Yes, if I was a gentIeman
with a hat and a watoh...
...I wouId Iike to be virtuous.
Must be a flne thing,
that virtue, Captain.
Good, Woyzeck.
You are a good man, a good man,
but you think too much...
...and that wears on you.
You aIways Iook so hunted.
Our IittIe taIk has reaIIy
taken it out of me.
Go now.
And don't run! SIowIy!
Nice and sIow down the street.
Yes, Andres, the pIace is cursed.
See that Iight streak?
That's where the heads roII at night.
Two little rabbits there did sit...
nibbling the green, green grass...
Quiet.
Andres...
...hear that?
It's coming.
Nibbling the green, green...
It's coming up behind me.
Beneath me.
HoIIow. Hear that?
It's aII hoIIow down there!
I'm scared.
It is a strange siIence.
You want to hoId your breath.
Andres!
What?
Say something!
How it rises over the town...
- Run! Don't Iook back.
- Okay.
Woyzeck...
...can you stiII hear it?
StiII.
AII is stiII.
As if the worId was dead.
We have to get away!
You hear that?
Look, here they come.
What a man!
Like a tree...
He stands on his feet Iike a Iion.
WeII, what friendIy eye,
Mrs. neighbor.
You rareIy see that on her.
SoIdiers, those are handsome men...
Your eyes stiII do shine...
What if? Take your eyes to the
Jew and have them poIished...
...maybe they wiII shine, so you
can seII them for two buttons.
WeII, hear, hear! Ms. Virgin!
I'm an honorabIe person.
But you... you Iook
through Ieather pants!
Tramp! Come on, boy.
What do peopIe want?
You're but the son of a whore...
...who makes his mom happy with
your dishonest face.
Who's there?
Is it you, Franz?
Come in.
I can't. Got roII caII.
Been out cutting branches
for the Captain?
Yes, Marie.
What's the matter, Franz?
You Iook upset.
Marie, it was there again.
There's not much written about it:
The smoke arose from the Iand,
Iike smoke from an oven...
Man!
It foIIowed me aII the way to town.
What is going to happen?
Franz!
Tonight I have to go to mass.
I saved up a IittIe bit again.
That man! So absent.
He didn't Iook at his chiId.
He might go crazy with
these thoughts.
Why so siIent, boy?
Are you frightened?
What must I witness, Woyzeck?
You! A man of your word!
You!
You.
- What do you mean, Doctor?
- I saw it, Woyzeck.
I saw you pissing in the street,
on the waII Iike a dog!
And that with three dimes
a day pIus board!
Woyzeck, that is bad.
The worId is going bad, very bad.
But sir, the caII of nature...
CaII of nature? CaII of nature?
Superstition, awfuI superstition!
Nature.
Woyzeck...
Haven't I shown that the
musculus constrictor vesicae...
...is subject to the wiII?
Nature?
Woyzeck... mankind is froe.
CouIdn't hoId your water.
That's betrayaI, Woyzeck!
Have you had your peas, Woyzeck?
Nothing but peas, remember!
Next week, we'II start with mutton.
This is going to
revoIutionize science.
0.10 urea, hydrochIoric
ammonium, hyperosyduI...
Woyzeck...
...don't you have to piss again?
Why don't you go in there and try it.
I can't, Doctor.
But you can on a waII!
I saw it with my own two eyes!
I had my nose out the window
to verify a sneeze hypothesis!
No, Woyzeck, I wiII not get angry.
Anger is unheaIthy, unscientiflc.
I am caIm.
PerfectIy caIm.
My puIse is at its usuaI 60.
And I say this most insensitiveIy.
Who wouId want to get angry
about a mere human being?
If it wouId have been one of
my test animaIs that had died...
But Woyzeck... you shouIdn't
have pissed on that waII.
You see, Doctor...
Sometimes, one has such...
...a charactor, or structure...
Nature... that is so...
...Iike... for exampIe...
Woyzeck, you're
phiIosophizing again.
Have you ever seen any
doubIe nature, Doctor?
When the sun was high at noon
as if the worId's on flre...
...a frightfuI voice spoke to me.
Woyzeck, you had an aberration.
But nature, Doctor,
when nature is over...
What is that, when nature is over?
When nature is over, it's...
when nature is over.
That's when...
...the worId gets so dark...
...that you have to feeI your
way around with your hands...
...and it dissoIves Iike a spider web.
When something is, and yet isn't.
When aII goes dark...
...and onIy a red gIow in the West,
Iike from a chimney...
- When...
- Man...
...you're groping around with
your feet Iike a spider!
The toadstooIs...
Doctor...
...the toadstooIs.
Did you ever notice how they
grow in flgures on the ground?
If one couId read that...
Woyzeck, you have the most
wonderfuI aberratio mentalis partialis.
The second kind.
BeautifuIIy deveIoped.
Woyzeck...
...I wiII give you a raise.
Second kind... Fixed idea,
with a generaIIy sane condition.
StiII shaving your Captain as usuaI?
Yes, sir.
- Eating your peas?
- AIways.
My wife gets the money.
- Doing your duty?
- Yes, sir.
You are an interesting case.
You have a beautifuI flxed idea.
You'II make it to the nuthouse yet.
Subject Woyzeck...
...just be good.
Let me feeI your puIse.
What shouId I do?
Eat peas, then mutton.
And cIean your rifle.
You're getting a bonus dime
this week.
My theory...
My new theory...
Ladies and GentIemen!
Step right up!
Ladies and gentIemen!
Come and see my show!
The creature and the art!
Look at the creature as God made it.
A nothing, a zero, absoIuteIy nothing.
And now see the art...
...waIks upright...
...wear jacket, wears pants,
swings saber!
The monkey is a soIdier.
That's not much yet...
...it's the Iowest rank of mankind.
So, take a bow. Good.
You're a baron.
Ladies and gentIemen...
...get your tickets for our
astronomicaI horse.
Right inside the tent.
PIease, step right up!
- Do you want to?
- AIright.
Must be quite something.
Look at the tasseIs on that man!
And the woman has pants on!
Look at her.
What a woman!
You couId sire a cavaIry regiment
on her...
Yes, and breed drum-majors!
Ladies and gentIemen. You wiII
now see the AstronomicaI Horse.
It'II teII you anything
you want to know.
How oId? What iIIness?
How many kids?
Show your taIent!
Show your beastIy reason!
Put human society to shame!
Ladies and gentIemen...
...the animaI you see here,
with its taiI and four hooves...
...is a member of
the academic society...
...and professor at our university...
...where he teaches the
students to ride and to flght.
Is there a jackass present in
our esteemed assembIy?
You can't fooI him!
How much is two times two?
Two times two.
Two, three, four, very good!
Thank you.
What a genius!
Look at that.
Now teII the gentIemen
what time it is.
Does anyone have a watoh handy?
A watoh?
- Here you go, sir.
- I've got to see this.
- But I'm not giving it to you.
- Just check what time it is.
This is a woman!
Marie!
Show me how you march.
A chest Iike a buII...
...and paws Iike a Iion.
There is no one Iike you.
I'm the proudest Iady of aII.
Wait tiII Sunday, when I have my
pIumed hat and white gIoves on...
Stunning.
The prince aIways says,
"That's a man!"
You don't say. A man!
And you are a woman, Marie.
Christ AImighty!
We shouId start a brood
of IittIe drum-majors.
Leave me aIone!
- Hey, a wiId one.
- Don't touch me!
Do you have the deviI
in your eyes?
Might as weII.
It's aII the same.
GentIemen students, I'm up here...
...and when I drop this cat
out of the window...
...how wiII it behave in terms of
gravity and foIIowing its instinct?
Hey, Woyzeck!
Woyzeck!
Woyzeck, come here!
Doctor, she's shitting.
You'd think she's your grandma,
the way you're hugging her.
- Doctor, I've got the shakes.
- That's flne, Woyzeck, flne.
Fine.
GentIemen, the animaI
has no scientiflc instinct.
But you get to see something eIse.
Look at this man. For a quarter of
a year, he ate nothing but peas.
Note the effects.
FeeI how erratic his puIse is.
This and the eyes.
Take a Iook, gentIemen,
take a Iook...
- Doctor...?
- FeeI it.
Doctor, I'm fainting.
Courage, Woyzeck.
A few more and we're done.
By the way, wiggIe your ears
for the gentIemen.
I wanted to show you this before.
He uses two muscIes.
Go on!
But, Doctor...
Beast, shaII I wiggIe your ears?
WiII you faiI us Iike the cat?
There, gentIemen. Those are
transitions to the donkey...
...often caused by femaIe
upbringing and the mother tongue.
How much hair has your mom
puIIed out, out of tenderness?
It has gotten reaIIy thin IateIy.
Yes, the peas, gentIemen.
How they gIitter!
What kind of stones
did he say they were?
SIeep, boy.
CIose your eyes.
Quiet or he'II get you.
Girl, close the shutters tight,
the gypsy boy is out tonight.
He will take you by the hand
and lead you off to gypsy land.
I bet they're goId.
How nice they'II be for the dance.
Our kind onIy has a IittIe corner
in the worId and a tiny mirror...
...yet I have a mouth as red
as any flne dame...
...with a mirror top to toe...
...and their gentIemen,
who kiss their hands.
I'm onIy a poor girI.
SIeep, chiId. CIose your eyes.
The sIeep angeI...
...how it's flitting across the waII...
CIose your eyes, or it'II Iook
at you and make you bIind.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
Something's shining
between your flngers.
An earring. I found it.
I never found anything
Iike that, two at once!
I'm just human.
It's aIright, Marie.
The boy's fast asIeep.
His arm is bothering him.
Bright drops on his forehead.
Nothing but work under the sun.
We even sweat in our sIeep.
Here's some money, Marie.
My pay and something
from the Captain.
God bIess you, Franz.
I have to go.
See you tonight, Marie.
Goodbye.
I am a bad person.
I couId stab myseIf!
- Doctor, sIow down!
- I'm in a hurry.
No man with a cIear conscience
rushes Iike that.
Doctor, aIIow me to save a Iife.
Doctor, I am so meIanchoIy.
I'm aIways raving about something...
I cry at the sight of my coat
hanging on the waII.
BIoated...
...typicaI constitution for a stroke.
Yes, Captain...
...typicaI constitution for a stroke.
Yes, Captain...
...you may have a brain stroke.
Maybe it wiII onIy affect one side,
and you'II be onIy haIf-paraIyzed...
...with some Iuck your brain wiII go.
Leaving you to vegetate.
Those are your prospects
for the next four weeks.
But, I can assure you that you
wiII make for an interesting case...
...and God wiIIing,
you'II be abIe to mumbIe...
...and we can make
groundbreaking experiments.
Don't scare me, Doctor!
PeopIe have died of fright before...
...simpIy of fright.
I aIready see the peopIe
with IiIies in their hands...
...but they wiII say,
"He was a good man, a good man."
Hey, Woyzeck, what's the hurry?
Stay awhiIe, Woyzeck.
Running through creation Iike
a razor. You wiII cut someone.
Running, Iike he has to shave a
whoIe regiment of eunuchs...
...that wiII hang him over the Iast
hair, before he can get away.
But, about the Iong beards,
what was I going to say?
- The Iong beards...
- A Iong beard under the chin...
PIinius taIked about that.
SoIdiers shouId get rid of this habit.
Yes, about the Iong beards.
Found any hair in your soup,
Woyzeck?
Hey, do you understand me?
Yes Sir, Captain.
A human hair from the beard of
a private, a sergeant, a...
...a drum-major's?
Hey, Woyzeck?
But he has a good wife.
He doesn't have this probIem.
Yes, sir.
What are you saying, Captain?
Look at his face.
WeII, maybe not in your soup...
...but if you hurry, you may
stiII flnd one on a pair of Iips.
A pair of Iips, Woyzeck!
I have known Iove, Woyzeck!
The guy is white as a ghost!
Captain...
...I am a poor deviI.
She's aII I have in this worId.
If you're joking, Captain...
Joking? Me? You're a funny guy!
The puIse, Woyzeck, the puIse!
Weak, hard, jumpy...
...irreguIar.
The earth is hot as heII,
I'm coId as ice. HeII is coId...
ImpossibIe! You want to bet?
ImpossibIe, man, man!
FaciaI muscIes very tense, jumpy
at times. Posture upset and tense.
I'm going now.
A Iot is possibIe.
We have nice weather, Captain.
Look at that nice, soIid, gray sky...
...you feeI Iike driving in
a peg and hang yourseIf.
AII because of that IittIe question...
...of yes, and then yes and no.
Captain, did the no cause the
yes, or the yes the no?
I want to think about that.
Damn...!
PhenomenaI!
Woyzeck! Bonus!
PeopIe make me dizzy.
I don't Iike that.
A good man pays attention
and Ioves his Iife.
A good person has no courage.
An idiot has courage!
I onIy joined the war
to affirm my Iove for Iife.
Grotesque... grotesque...
HeIIo, Franz.
It's stiII you.
Indeed.
No, I can't see it.
You Iook so strange, Franz.
I'm scared.
I see nothing.
I see nothing.
One shouId see it, one shouId
be abIe to grab it with his flsts!
What is it, Franz?
You are insane.
A Iot of peopIe waIk the street, right?
You taIk to anyone, what do I care?
Did he stand here?
There, yes?
There?
Did he do this?
I wish I wouId've been him!
Him! I can't forbid peopIe to
waIk the street and...
...teII them to Ieave their
mouth at home.
Leave the Iips at home. They're
so beautifuI, it wouId be a shame.
But the wasps Iike to Iand on it.
And which wasp has stung you?
A sin, so fuII and wide.
It stinks...
...flt to smoke the angeIs
out of heaven.
You have a red mouth, Marie...
...and not a bIister on it.
- Franz, your fever is taIking.
- I saw him!
You can see a Iot with two good
eyes and the sun shining.
Did he stand here?
Like that? Like that?
When the day is Iong
and the worId oId...
...a Iot of peopIe can be
in one pIace or another.
Hit me, Franz!
I'd rather have a knife in my body
than your hand on me.
No.
There shouId be a sign on her.
There shouId be a sign on her.
Every man is an abyss.
You get dizzy Iooking in.
Innocence, there's a mark on you.
Do I know? Do I know?
Who does know?
Down at the Inn is a pretty maid
She sits in the garden,
day and night. She sits in...
Yes?
Andres, they are dancing!
Yes, at the White Horse.
I saw the girIs Ieave.
She sits in her garden,
until the clock strike twelve
and waits for the soldiers.
WiII her hands be hot?
PeopIe are steaming.
Damn!
What do you want?
I have to go there. I have to see.
TroubIemaker!
Because of her?
Don't stop! Don't stop!
Him... her...
Don't stop! Don't stop!
Spin and roII around!
Why doesn't the Lord
bIow out the sun...
...so everyone can roII in fornication?
Do it in bright dayIight,
do it Iike the flies on my hand.
Don't stop, don't stop.
The bastard...
...how he's feeIing her up!
But...
...when a wanderer, Ieaning
against the stream of time...
...or answering to himseIf with
divine wisdom...
...is saying to himseIf,
"Why does man exist?"
Why does man exist?
But honestIy, I'm teIIing you...
...how wouId the farmer,
the cobbIer, the doctor Iive...
...if God hadn't created man?
How the soIdier, if he wasn't
endowed with the desire...
...the desire...
...the desire to kiII his own kind?
Therefore, doubt not.
AII things of this worId are eviI.
Even money decays.
FinaIIy, dear congregation...
...Iet's piss crossways so a Jew dies!
Don't stop...don't stop...
There!
Louder! Louder!
What are you saying?
What?
Stab dead.
ShouId I?
Must I?
Do I hear it there, too?
Is the wind saying it, too?
Stab dead.
Do I hear it?
Don't stop.
Don't stop.
Don't stop.
I'm a man!
A man, I say!
Who wants to have some?
Who isn't too God aImighty drunk
to take me on?
I'II knock your nose up your ass!
Hey, you...
A man has to drink!
A man has to drink!
ShouId I tear out your tongue
and wrap it around you?
ShouId I Ieave you enough
air for a grandma's fart?
Hey, break it up!
The guy has to turn bIue.
Give me brandy,
give me wine...
...a cast-iron gut and
a ramrod spine!
One thing at a time.
Andres... Andres...
I can't sIeep.
When I cIose my eyes,
I start spinning...
...and then I hear the flddIes.
Don't stop, don't stop.
And it speaks from the waII.
Andres!
Andres, can you hear it?
Yes, Iet them dance.
Now Iay me down to sIeep, Amen.
It aIways says, "Stab! Stab!"
I feeI a pain between
my eyes Iike a knife.
SIeep, fooI!
Andres.
And no guiIe is found
in His mouth.
And the Pharisees brought unto
Him a woman, taken in aduItery...
...and set her in the midst.
And Jesus said unto her...
"Neither do I condemn thee.
Go and sin no more."
Lord, don't Iook at me!
Franz didn't come.
Not yesterday, not today.
It's getting hot here!
You didn't hear anything?
But he said something.
What can I say?
He Iaughed and then he said...
..."A deIicious woman!
What thighs, hot as sin!"
So...
- That's what he said.
- Where to, Woyzeck?
Get my officer wine.
But Andres... she was a speciaI girI.
Who was?
Nothing. Goodbye.
- It's too much for the pistoI.
- You want to buy it, or not?
How much is the knife?
It's very straight. You want
to cut your throat with it?
I give it to you as cheap as the next.
Death shouId be cheap,
but not for froe!
You shouId have an
economicaI death.
- This cuts more than bread...
- Two dimes.
There! Like it was nothing,
and yet it's money. The dog!
Here, Andres...
...this shirt's not part of the uniform.
You couId use it.
Yeah.
This ring and cruciflx
beIonged to my sister.
I aIso have a IittIe Saint's image.
Two hearts and made of goId.
My mother kept it in her bibIe.
Yeah.
Friedrich Johann Franz Woyzeck,
private...
...rifleman in the 2nd regiment,
2nd battaIion, 4th company.
Born on Annunciation day,
the 20th of JuIy.
Today I am 40 years oId...
...7 months and 12 days.
Franz, you shouId go
to the inflrmary.
Poor guy, you need to drink
Iiquor with powder in it.
It kiIIs the fever.
When the carpenter gathers shavings,
whose head wiII rest upon them?
Marie, sing us a song!
- I can't.
- Why?
- Because.
- Why because?
Come here.
I teII you a story.
Once upon a time, there was a
poor chiId, with no mom and dad.
Everything was dead and
not a souI was Ieft in the worId.
She went out and searched
day and night.
Since nobody was Ieft on earth,
she wanted to go to heaven.
And the moon Iooked
at her so friendIy.
When she flnaIIy reached the moon,
it was a piece of rotten wood.
So, then she went to the sun...
...but when she got to the sun,
it was a wiIted sunflower.
And when she went to the stars,
they were IittIe goIden bugs.
And when she wanted to return to
earth, itwas an upside-down cauIdron.
And she was aII aIone.
So, she sat down and started to cry.
And there she sits to this day,
aII aIone.
Marie, we have to go. It's time.
- Where to?
- I don't know.
- But this is the way back to town.
- You have to stay.
But I want to go home.
You won't get sore feet.
How strange you are!
Do you know how Iong
it's been now, Marie?
Two years this Pentecost.
Do you aIso know how Iong
it's going to Iast?
I have to prepare supper.
How hot your Iips are.
Hot...
...whore breath.
And yet I'd give heaven
to kiss them one more time...
A red moon rising!
Franz, what are you up to?
Dance, sweat and stink,
he wiII get you aII in the end.
So, Katy... sit down.
I am hot. Hot.
That's the way it is, the deviI
takes one and Iets the other go!
You are hot, too, Katy.
How come?
You'II be coId, too, in the end!
Marie!
Katy, Katy, be reasonabIe!
CouIdn't you sing, Katy?
For Swabia I do not care
and a long dress I do not wear.
For long dresses, pointed shoes
aren't for a maid to choose.
What's that on your hand?
- Me?
- Red...
- BIood!
- BIood.
- BIood...
- Yes, I cut myseIf on my Ieft hand.
Then how did it get on your eIbow?
I wiped it off.
What? With your Ieft hand on
your Ieft eIbow? How skiIIfuI...
What do you want?
What do you care? Move!
You think I kiIIed someone?

There, the knife!
The knife, I found it.

You don't know?
There's a dead woman out there!

Hurry, so we don't miss everything.
A good murder, a reaI murder,

can hope to see.
We haven't had one Iike this in ages.
