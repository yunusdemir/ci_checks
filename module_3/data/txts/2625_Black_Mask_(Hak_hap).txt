There is a warning to the 701 team member.
You have entered the prohibited zone
of the military base.
Do not proceed further.
Surrender now.
We will escort you back to
the Experiment Block.
We are acting under a special permission
to kill.
Any counter attack will result
in a full force attack.
You are surrounded,
drop your weapons and surrender at once.
I adopt a new identity,
my name is now Tsui Chik.
I am the librarian here.
For me, this is the perfect place.
Here, I can look up anything
that interests me.
Also, there are usually hardly anyone around
except for those few nosy people.
No, you've typed wrongly again.
Tracy, it's not your first time.
Take it easy.
But this has got to be a new record.
I got dumped even before
I find out his name!
The one who's crying is Tracy.
Nicknamed Update.
he claims she's always
at the forefront of fashion
and she specializes a falling in
and out of love,
that's why she cries a lot.
This is the chief of the library.
He looks tough
but deep down, he's really a good guy.
He likes to joke a lot.
As for me
this is the best shelter for me.
It allows me to quietly search
for the most basic quality in a human.
Feeling.
Tracy, you should know better
than anyone else.
Good looking hunks are the worst lot.
But he's only 5 ft. 2, how can he be a hunk?
He must be rich then.
Rich men are just as bad.
For me, if he's not a hunk,
he'd better be rich.
If he has neither, who wants him?
I want someone for his personality.
Tracy, be practical,
find someone who is common.
You never know, this someone may
just be around the corner.
Wait.
I hope you are not referring to yourselves?
No.
Aren't we kind to you?
Maybe just a casual relationship.
Actually, do you have someone in mind?
Over there.
That piece of wood?
A real nerd!
Tracy,
Tracy, haven't you suffered enough
from those heartless guys?
That's right, Tsui Chik.
He's always here, I never see him go out.
He must have saved up a lot of money.
He doesn't smoke or drink,
doesn't gamble either.
How can you be sure that
he doesn't gamble?
Tsui Chik.
Come over here.
Yes, chief?
Let's play mahjong after work.
Don't you have enough players already?
Szeto's got a date.
So, what do you say? Be a good sport!
Normally,
how much can you win in one game?
You can win $300-$500
on a very lucky night.
Hooked!
Here's $300, alright,
consider me having lost.
I'll take it.
I really don't know the game
and I've a lot of books I must read.
That's ridiculous, how can you hand over
your money just like that?
I hardly ever spend money anyway.
I'll go sort out the books.
He...
Tsui Chik.
How can anyone love reading so much?
These days,
man like this only exists in fictions.
This kind of man is like dinosaur.
You better act quickly.
Loving him or not is another matter,
just take it as gambling.
Just like playing mahjong.
Right...
Even you two have to break up in future,
you can brush him off first.
Don't hesitate anymore, act now.
Ask him for a date! Hurry up!
Right, date him!
Go!
Tsui... Tsui!
Chik!
I'm wondering...
You are expecting someone?
Can we go now?
I am waiting.
I beg you not to whisper
in my ear again, OK?
Let's go.
Your turn.
He's a cop. Nicknamed the rock.
Dark and hard, true to his name.
We get along very well,
more importantly, he has never
asked about my background.
I feel safe with him.
He is my only friend.
Your turn now.
You are pretty slow today.
Anything on your mind?
Cases you can't solve?
Of course not!
No?
I read in the newspaper that over
30 drug lords have been killed
in the last 5 days.
Aren't you on this case?
I'll take your castle!
It's not important who's on the case.
As far as I'm concerned,
these scumbags are better dead.
You should not fight violence
by using violence.
Knight taken!
Problem still unsolved?
I'll have to take charge
and eliminate them all for good.
Why go for complete destruction?
Allow them a path to survival.
I'll let the law decide their fate.
Queen taken. Your turn!
The law is seldom as effective as we are.
Find a good lawyer,
and you can run free.
Checkmate!
Don't you say we should allow
a path for survival?
Playing chess is different...
Let's have another game.
Should I give you a handicap?
What did I say wrong?
I punch you for no reason,
aren't you mad?
You must have your reason
for punching me.
I have no reason whatsoever.
Really?
Forget it, let's concentrate on the game.
Have you never lost your temper?
In this messy world, you must be able
to protect yourself.
Isn't it nice to be a gentle person?
You just said it.
Over 30 drug lords were killed.
In this world which is filled with violence,
if you can't protect yourself,
you won't survive.
Do you get it?
Come on, let's carry on.
I must educate you.
Where are you going?
I must take relieve.
Wait till after you finish this game.
Brother Tai, Ah Choi of the Wo Yee Hall
called and said that,
the leaders of the Four Great Families
are gathered already.
But we're still unable to contact King Kau.
They suspect that all 36 drugs dealers
were killed by King.
These old foxes,
King Kau got the blame only because
he didn't put in an appearance.
Without a convicted murderer,
everyone is still a suspect.
Remember!
Don't underestimate those old guys.
Or you will fall into their traps easily.
Brother Tai, you're right.
None of them can be trusted.
There are three Mercedez approaching.
Got it, let them in.
Check it out.
Brother Tai, no problem.
Today,
I'll show them what I am made of.
Got you, Brother Tai.
What happened? We talked to them
only five minutes ago.
They are all dead now.
Let's go.
Brother, be careful.
King Kau isn't dead yet. It's him!
Saur, something has gone very wrong here,
come in quickly to save me!
Why is there no answer?
Answer me!
Are you all dead?
King Kau,
you want to take all the territories?
Can you handle it?
Brother.
Saur, protect me, protect me!
Don't kill me!
- I am not Saur.
- Who are you?
With your death, we have now eliminated
about all of the drug dealers in Hong Kong.
Your watch is here, don't leave it behind.
Do you have any money on you?
I don't even have enough money
to take the metro home.
Can you lend me some money?
Take it.
Twenty dollars?
What good is it? Do you have any more?
Give it all to me.
I have only another fifty.
Seventy dollars is all you have?
You go out with only seventy dollars on you?
Yes, that's all I have.
What is this?
A chess set.
Really?
Damn it!
What good is a chess set?
Don't move! Hands up!
I have no money! What are you doing here?
Check whether he has money or not?
I've given everything to you.
- Stop searching, I have no more money.
- Why don't you have money?
Where did you hide your money?
Speak up.
What are you laughing at?
You are threatened by a knife!
Why do you laugh?
Watch your knife!
It's because of people like you
who are too cowardly.
That the bad guys are getting more
and more out of control.
It's none of my business!
Now, let me teach you a lesson. Come on.
Punch him.
You have already done the serious punching.
If I join in,
I think they will die.
You are not always lucky!
I am not always with you...
to protect you.
Something urgent has come up,
I must run.
Hey, your watch!
News round up :
This afternoon at the loading dock
of Kwun Tong Pier,
one hundred drug dealers were slaughtered.
Only one man was found alive,
but he was seriously injured.
He is being sent to a hospital
for emergency treatment.
Where am I?
Police, we are sending you
to the hospital.
I am not going to the hospital.
Don't worry. You are the only survivor,
we have to send you to the hospital.
Don't move...
Don't move...
Who stitched up for me?
Who did the operation for me?
Stay calm, don't move!
I am not going to the hospital, no...
My heart is aching,
my heart is aching badly.
Crab, what's the latest?
Another 100 drug dealers were just killed.
There's only one survivor.
How's he now?
His name is Kong, and he is on his way
to the hospital.
What?
His chest was cut open
and then stitched up again.
How come?
Alright,
I'm on my way.
According to the X-ray, an electronic equipment
has been planted in his heart.
It doesn't seem to be a medical device
installed for the patient.
It is likely to be a bomb.
Such advanced weapon!
The triads are really getting tougher
these days.
What are you doing here?
I am looking for Inspector Shek.
He's busy,
he can't see you.
I have a very important message
to give him.
No, no one can enter.
The area behind this is completely
blocked off.
Hurry.
The bomb disposal officer has arrived.
Get the bomb discharging unit, quick.
Cut the wires.
Be careful.
Pull the ribs open.
There is something unidentifiable found
under the left heart chamber.
Get ready for disposing the bomb.
Get ready for blood vessels connection.
Wait.
These are not blood vessels,
but wires of a bomb.
If you touch it even lightly, it'll explode.
Doctor, try to speed up his heart beat,
hurry up.
We are not sure which is wire
and which is vessel.
The heart beat of the patient is so weak.
Get ready 50 cc cardio tonics.
How powerful is the bomb?
According to the volume
of the liquidated nitrogen,
it can wipe out all of us in this room.
All people should retreat.
I'll stay behind to dispose the bomb.
But if his pulse and his heart beat changes,
you won't know how to save him,
Iet me stay with you.
Alright, all of you leave at once,
only the three of us will stay.
There are 16 wires inter dispersed
with the veins.
Now I have to pair them off
and then cut them group by group.
Detective, please give me a hand.
Alright, I'll do it, when to cut?
When I count to three, let's cut it together.
One.
Two.
Three.
Detective.
What's the matter?
Sir, the Commissioner is on the phone,
he wants to talk to you immediately.
Commissioner, this is Shek.
I am Tsui Chik.
How do you find this number?
No time to explain now,
are you disposing a bomb?
In the bomb, there are the blue
and the red wires.
How do you know?
You listen carefully, don't cut the blue wire.
I already did.
Then, run for your life.
But there are still many people here.
Leave, right away. The bomb will go off
any minute now.
Let's evacuate immediately.
Leave this place right now! Right now!
Come out!
How do you know I am in the hospital?
How do you know I am disposing a bomb?
Why do you disguise as the
commissioner to call me?
And, why are you so sure
about the red and blue wires of the bomb?
Don't tell me you were tipped off.
And don't tell me the phone number...
was found in the telephone directory.
Answer me.
All the fact I quoted can be found
in the books on this shelf.
How about the phone number?
In fact,
I didn't call through any special line.
I just pretended
to be the Police Commissioner.
Your subordinates love kissing asses,
when they heard it was the Commissioner,
they called me Sir.
Ah! Tsui Chik actually...
prefers man.
Tracy, I feel sorry for you.
A nice beautiful girl like you
Iosing to the rock.
So after all,
you do have a sound detective mind.
Why don't you come work for me?
Here you have to report to so many people,
isn't it better for you to serve only me?
Alright!
Dark and ugly,
how can Tsui Chik choose him instead?
Maybe it's admiration on the inspector's part.
But I am not used to doing it at your place.
Well, then come over
when you get off work here,
Are you gay?
Don't get on my nerve.
Take it back and study it.
I am a karate expert, you know?
They will terminate this squad.
But they won't let any of us leave in peace.
Alert everyone,
ask them to leave as soon as possible.
We are trained by them.
We are the most skillful killers in the world.
Why do they want to destroy us?
They didn't think of how to control us
when they started this plan.
Up till now, they've found
that they can't control us.
So they decided to cancel this plan.
One more hour is left.
If we don't leave now,
we will all die.
You'd better leave here at once.
Say good-bye for me
to all the team members.
- Where are you going to?
- Asia
Sir, King Kau has shown up.
King is now the last of the drug lords.
he can have full control over the market.
Do you think he is the murderer?
One can easily come to that conclusion.
Are you that little jerk?
I am not a little jerk.
I am Inspector Shek Wai-ho.
From the anti-triad and serious crime bureau
of the Royal Hong Kong Police Force.
Are you putting me on?
Follow me.
Get lost, who do you think you are?
I've received many presents this day.
This is...
my daughter's leg.
Follow me!
Check around.
All these plastic bags are for me.
In this.....
This is the dead body of my dad.
This is my mom.
This is my God-brother.
My whole family is here.
Another plastic bag is for me.
But I threw it away.
Why do you waste it?
Doesn't it fit your size?
I want protection.
You?
Are you pulling off a stunt?
Why do you want protection?
Tell me, who is after you?
I have no idea.
Inspector,
take a look!
Set her free.
Yes.
It is she who told me to hang her up.
Miss, is King Kau telling the truth?
Yes.
Whose phone is ringing?
Not mine.
Yours?
Who has left the mobile phone here?
You follow me.
The rest just stay behind.
Master Kau, please stay here.
This place is safer.
Be very careful. It may be a set up.
Yes.
Who wants to pick on me?
Come out... Hurry up!
Inspector, they are armed.
Should we arrest them?
Wait.
No, the wire is on fire.
The main switch!
Get lost, don't stand there like a log.
Is it earthquake?
Never, not in Hong Kong.
Sir... I can't move!
Don't panic! Hurry up.
Inspector. Try hard.
Try hard!
That was close!
No one is inside the car,
I am going to take a look.
Inspector, be careful.
Where is the wheel?
How to stop then?
Ask them not to shoot!
Inspector Shek is up there!
Drop the gun! Police!
The police, so what!
Shoot him!
Are you scared?
Don't panic, I am here with you.
Isn't it exciting?
I haven't tried that before.
Don't waste it.
Are you kidding?
Yuek-lan?
Sir.
Mission failed, let's retreat now.s
So smart looking!
I've just seen you wearing a mask,
sure looks like Batman.
Thank you Sir.
When there is real action,
I can't protect you anymore.
You must remember.
How is King Kau?
Not good. He is in intensive care.
I've assigned four teams of police
to protect him 24 hrs.
I hope we can get good information
from him when he wakes up.
Inspector Shek,
there were many people inside.
So I've kept quiet.
What the hell are you doing?
Want to play hero?
Why did you mask yourself
and dress in black
when you were working?
Even the SDU questioned me.
They said we have a cute new uniform.
Commissioner...
I can stand misjudgment in others.
Commissioner,
If you really think I am the man
who put on a mask last night,
be frank,
I started to suspect your judgement.
Look at me, look at my eyes.
Do I seem like the kind of guy
who puts on a mask and mess about?
Of course, you do.
Here is your coffee,
'Black Mask'!
Sorry, I can't help it.
Listen, I don't want to repeat myself.
The police force is a disciplinary force.
Now I warn you seriously.
You can't wear such weird costume
during office hour just to show off yourself.
Understand?
Can I wear it when I am off duty?
No way,
have I made myself clear?
Yes, sir.
Inspector Shek,
somebody is looking for you!
There's nothing I can do.
Can you help me to prove that
I am not the 'Black Mask'?
What is the 'Black Mask'?
This is your watch.
Oh, you've got it.
I've searched for a week.
Losing a watch is no big deal,
but it's much harder
to find a missing person.
I had a student, once.
She suddenly disappeared and
I haven't heard from her since.
But we just made contact again.
She called me yesterday.
So?
She said she was locked up by the police.
Can you do me a favor?
Officer Shek, we have just taken
the girl's statement.
- Leave it to me.
- Yes sir.
Follow me.
Someone is looking for you.
Your teacher is here for you.
Your teacher looks very young.
Sir, we have been looking for you.
I can't imagine that you've come
to Hong Kong.
Are you working for the police?
No,
I am just helping my friend.
Friend?
This is the reason
that made you pick on your old team mates?
Yes.
I don't want to see so many people sacrificing.
Have you noticed the kids inside?
They all have smiling faces.
I do envy them.
Who is your boss?
Take me to him.
Sir, it's you who encouraged me
to be a warrior.
Now, you asked me
to be an ordinary people.
How dare you court my boss's girl?
We can never be ordinary people again.
You don't want to live?
You bump my nose!
Listen, he is my friend.
From now on, I'll hold you
responsible if he is hurt.
Get lost.
Stop nagging,
I think you'd better move in with me.
No.
Why?
Violence against violence
isn't a good way to beat crimes.
It will only make the world more messy.
I guess I'll have to give you a good
beating up before you'll get it.
See, now you want to beat even
your friend!
I just want to teach you how to be smart.
You don't need to beat me
to teach me to be smart.
I am not planning to.
I am just raising my voice.
Why did you shout?
You are so far away from me,
how can you hear me?
Bastard, if I catch you,
I will beat you to death.
No, please don't!
The fifth to ninth segment of the
vertebral column are all smashed.
General, you are seriously hurt,
I have to deplete your blood.
Commander, don't abandon me.
This will make you feel better.
I help him to deplete his blood,
his heart will fail as a result.
But at least he will die more comfortably.
Put me through to Columbia.
Commander, it's connected.
Mission completed.
Our motive has been reached.
Ask them to deposit the second payment
to our bank account.
They said now that we have killed
all the drug dealers,
no one deals with them anymore.
The police's files are more important
than the drug dealers.
If no one deals with them,
we can.
We can take over the whole SE Asia market.
They said, if we don't follow their instructions,
they won't pay us.
Don't worry,
people from Spain, Brazil and America
want to work with us.
We have plenty of dealers to choose from.
Tell him, we are raising the price
three times higher.
He is considering the proposal.
You cunning old fox!
You don't have much time left.
Still considering?
Do you know
who the masked guy is?
He's our coach.
He wants to see you.
Great.
If he is willing to join us,
our mission could be finished a lot faster.
What if he rejects our offer to join us?
He won't reject.
Because he is just like us,
having escaped from a failed experiment.
Only I can save him.
He will come back.
I have considered seriously,
I decided to resign.
701 has appeared in Hong Kong.
I'll have to face it myself.
This is Tracy,
I am in the library. Come and save me!
Happy birthday to you...
Happy birthday to you...
Happy birthday to Tsui Chik,
Happy birthday to you!
- Cut the birthday cake now.
- Make a wish.
We found the date of birth on your resume!
Are we smart or what?
How pathetic!
Pathetic?
This is my resignation letter.
Hey, take it easy! Please don't resign!
Don't resign!
I don't get the humour in this at all.
To be my friend will involve risks.
They are not suitable for that.
Detective Shek may be qualified.
At least, he can protect himself.
Tsui Chik.
Wait! Tsui Chik! Wait!
Loosen up! Why do you want to resign?
I have my own reason to resign!
This is for you.
Happy birthday!
Thank you.
It's late! It's hard for you to get a taxi.
Let me give you a ride, OK?
No, thanks.
I won't take advantage of you,
you know? By the way...
Get in, I'll drive.
- What's wrong?
- Get in now!
Hi, long time no see!
What's that?
Look that way!
You've finally shown up.
I hope you won't go against
the Hong Kong police.
If you do, I'll interfere.
Today,
I want to tell you a story about pigs.
There were these pigs,
they were transformed into human beings.
Then they were sent back to the farm
and were made to live with other pigs.
Then they realized that the pigs
were stupid and stinky.
And they discriminated against the pigs.
However, they couldn't turn back again,
so they threatened the pigs,
and made them kill each other.
The professor has not only destroyed
your nerves,
he has also destroyed your brain.
You are nuts.
Am I nuts?
Pigs are destined to be killed
by human beings.
We need not show pity on them.
But they are human beings, not pigs.
You are a shame and you are helpless.
Move!
Even if there is an antidote,
I will never give it to you.
But...
I don't think you can wait till that day.
Who are you?
Help!
Who are you?
Don't come over!
I will bite!
I am going to call the police.
Help! What do you want?
I'll ask my family to post you the money.
Don't harm me!
It hurts!
I have AIDS, don't rape me.
Your wound is so deep.
This is antiphlogistic.
Don't wander off.
You are in very dangerous situation.
If you are bored,
play with the TV game set.
If you are hungry,
call me.
I want to piss badly,
I almost wet my pants!
I am getting pressure from
the Yankees (cops).
They're calling everyday to check
whether we have found any clues.
I have sent my best guys
to investigate the case.
I am sure we can get something
in the next two days.
Since the event occurred in Hong Kong,
this should be handled
by Hong Kong police.
Americans shouldn't stick their nose in this.
But King Kau is the only
drugs dealer left in Hong Kong.
He is still in intensive care.
If he dies, we would have lost
our only link to information.
Among the victims,
there were undercovers.
I think it must be the foreign drug dealers...
trying to evade Hong Kong markets.
Our only hope is to establish contact
with the US network.
So we can get the information
of the US drugs dealers.
And then solve the case.
Connection established,
download process activated.
Report, duplication completed.
The security system of the Hong Kong Police's
computer must be the worst in the world.
They will never anticipate that
we will plot to steal
their computer information.
Keep on interrupting the Police's attention.
Sell the list of the US DEA
undercover agents to the Columbians.
Detective Shek will protect King Kau.
Use Shek as a bait to get our coach.
Yuek-lan,
you're responsible for this mission,
take charge!
For those who don't want to compromise,
there is only one solution.
I'm hungry.
Eat.
It's awful. What's this?
Preserved duck on rice.
Have you ever cooked a meal?
Forget it.
Here's the special news.
A mysterious man in all black
recently appears in Hong Kong.
What do the citizens think about
this man in black?
Is he a big popular singing star
disguised in black?
Where can I buy a photo of him?
This man is really weird.
Why does he dress in black all the time?
Why does he wear a mask?
Is it to hide his ugly face?
Thanks.
Next, let's hear...
some professional opinions.
In fact,
this hero is the psychological reflection
of people's consciousness.
Since we are exposed to so many
unfair things in life,
we are always looking for a hero
who make sure that justice is done.
I think this is an illusion.
Thank you!
Now, the police can't get any information
about the 'Black Mask'.
But the Commissioner has ordered a sanction
among all the film production companies,
they can't use it as a movie script.
Now, you are famous,
will you throw a concert later?
Let me be your agent.
You don't need to live here anymore.
It's too lonely.
You women
are so snobbish, how vain!
What do you mean? You masked yourself,
aren't you vain as well?
Women wearing make up is
as vain as a man wearing a mask.
I don't wear make up!
Really?
I wanna give you a gift.
Thank you!
Sorry.
Tsui Chik?
Tsui Chik?
I was lucky to be saved by you,
but how about Tsui Chik?
Will Tsui Chik die?
Is he important to you?
Not exactly, but...
he is pretty helpless,
he can't even take care of himself.
Please help me to find him, OK?
OK, I promise.
You know, men who always claim
how good they are,
can't be all that good.
Those who has real substance
rarely utter a word.
This is Tsui Chik.
Hi, it's you! I worry about you!
Now, I am in a very secure place.
I have been kidnapped.
But I don't know where I am now.
Everyday, I hear only 'Bang Bang Bang'.
I think this may be an industrial area.
And I hear the sound of planes.
I think I may be near the airport.
Also, this place is facing West.
During sunset, we get the sun.
Come and save me!
If you can't,
go to seek help
from your friend Inspector Shek.
Is that clear?
Alright, I'll think of something.
Remember, don't do anything silly.
Black Mask'll protect you!
OK. Bye bye!
Tsui Chik that nerd!
Please, be smart and save me.
Or I will die.
How come?
Inspector, our computer is infected.
I know it, same as mine.
Inspector, your friend Tsui Chik
is here looking for you.
There were many people killed
in the library.
None of my business.
How is Tracy now?
Don't worry, she is fine.
You are as mysterious as the 'Black Mask',
appearing and disappearing just like that.
Why don't you disguise as him?
So others won't mistake me
as the 'Black Mask'
When I knew you, you told me that,
if you want to be a good friend
with a person,
try not to know too much secret about him.
If you know too much,
you can't be friends any more.
It's not too late to understand
that philosophy now.
When he takes off his mask,
will I find my father?
Are you going to the hospital?
They're using you as a bait
to get the Black Mask!
You're no match for them!
You know,
everyday at this hour, I love standing
here to watch the sunset.
And I'll tell myself that.
I can still stand on the
same place the following day.
Tonight, I have to fight a tough battle.
I don't know whether 'Black Mask'
is my friend or my enemy.
I hope he won't appear.
If you have time,
come play chess with me tomorrow.
Sure I will.
You've never counter attacked before...
why this time?
Because I don't think
I need to hide anything anymore.
I'm a cop, I can arrest you.
I come to you...
not because you're a cop.
Cause you're my friend.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
SDU calling UP,
what's happening downstairs?
What's happened?
A guy was hurt in an accident.
He needs immediate operation.
Control...
a patient who was injured
in an industrial accident
is being sent to the hospital.
UP, gate!
Let him pass.
Let them move to the casualties.
Roger.
SDU control centre calling.
Nothing happened downstairs.
Everyone in position, keep on standing by.
How is the situation?
He has just been given sedative.
Don't come over. Are you a ghost?
Don't come over! No...
Don't move,
I've given you anesthetics.
You aren't going anywhere.
You can't escape.
Stop shooting! He's got no bullets.
Stand by... stand by.
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
Don't worry,
we won't hurt you.
Give me the gun.
Stay calm.
Don't panic.
Now is it? A colleague is on fire,
put out the fire now!
Go... go.
Two by two...cover formation.
Many colleagues of team one died.
Team one reform.
Join team two. Team three cover them.
Didn't you say the Black Mask
won't show up?
Black Mask didn't make that promise.
Inspector...
Don't come over here.
There are bombs on his body.
Damn it!
- Inspector.
- Inspector, are you hurt?
Sir...
Are you alright?
How are you? Are you alright?
Inspector, look!
Take it back as evidence.
Inspector, where are you going?
I am going to buy a pack of cigarettes.
Take the evidence back.
Yeuk-lan...
Yeuk-lan.
You saved me again.
But you are blocking me.
You helped me once,
I helped you too.
You will never get what you want.
Follow me back to our place,
Commander Hung will cure you.
I won't go back.
I don't want to be killer again.
You know?
I can't even feel like an ordinary people.
Soon, we will be able to have a new life.
We have come to steal information
from the anti-narcotics bureau
of the HK police.
So we can make a large sum of money.
Then we can afford to cure ourselves.
Your target isn't Hong Kong Police.
But the international drugs dealing gangs.
We sell information to the King of drugs
and control the whole market.
You are cold-blooded,
why do you want to cure yourself?
You can never do that.
You are bleeding very badly,
if it doesn't stop, you'll die.
Better follow me, sir.
I'd rather die.....
than follow you back.
I must stop you.
Wait for me!
Help...
What's up?
How are you?
Leave now.
Someone wants to kill me.
it is dangerous and
I can't protect you any further.
Danger!
Go!
My God, this is so high!
How to jump?
Don't come over. I am an ace shooter.
Come on!
Hold me tight!
Yeuk-lan, did you get Black Mask?
Commander, he ran away.
Yeuk-lan.
Go!
Don't move, you bleed a lot.
You need to take a good rest.
If you see my face, it will put you
in a more dangerous position.
Well, I won't insist then.
After your recovery,
I'm sure you will show me voluntarily.
Do you really want to help me?
Yes...
Get ready. We have a lot of things to do.
It's time to put an end here.
Kuen, Shi, Ho....
I can't imagine that you could
only live such short lives!
I know you would come.
It's useless for you to arrest
all these people.
The only way to stop them
is to ruin their plan.
Ruin their plan?
But they killed all the drugs dealers.
Will they kill the governor next?
They're accessing the police computer
network to steal information
The bodies buried here...
are police sacrificed in the hospital.
Police do die on duty.
We shouldn't blame a word.
But you know? I almost caught her.
I almost got her!
Because of you, she was saved!
They have died for nothing.
Take this.
And put it into your computer.
When they begin stealing police information,
the virus will enter their system.
Thank you for saving my life.
But I don't want to owe you anymore.
Even if I die in front of you,
I don't want you to save me.
If you have a good way of handling them.
I promise I won't bother.
This is duty of the police.
You can't even beat me,
how can you take on 701?
I'll give it my lost shot.
Stop your work.
Put this disc into the computer.
Inspector, without the order
of the Commissioner, we can't do that.
Please.
The computer is being infected.
Report, the computer virus is invading.....
Take the disc out,
or it'll completely erase the information
we have already got.
Give way!
Inspector, are you crazy?
It's a serious crime to use guns
without the proper license.
Drop the gun.
I know it's against the rules.
But I didn't have enough time
to report to you.
Some criminals are stealing information
from our computer.
I just want to damage their computer system.
Bull shit! We police have a tight security
against any stealing.
Any information obtained without our
proper approval will become useless data.
I order you to drop the gun. Now!
Stay calm, Inspector.
I just want to solve the case.
We can discuss this.
We can't. We haven't got time.
I forgot to load the gun.
Inspector, you are off
this case as of this minute.
You are suspended.
Now, go out and write me a report.
Take the disc out.
Yes sir.
Transmission back to normal.
Transmission go on.
Go on.
How is it?
No reaction.
Bull shit! We police have
tight security against any espionage.
Any information obtained without our proper
approval will become useless data.
Unless they are inside the police station.
They must be beneath the police station.
Where is it?
Hurry up, follow me.
I've got the application form!
But we haven't the Commissioner's signature.
Here it is.
Buddies, these are the arms I want.
Inspector,
is there a riot outside?
It's incredible.
They have actually set up their
base beneath the police station.
Inspector, according to the blue print,
it must be under here.
- Did you give him a walkie talkie?
- No, it's a bug.
I put it inside his watch.
- Does he know?
- No
Are you alright?
I am fine.
You are hurt.
Oh yeah.
They are cunning, better be careful.
Luckily you are not seriously injured,
otherwise...
how can I face Baby for your wedding
will be held next month.
That's right.
You'd annual leave 2 weeks ago,
and you'll have honey moon next month,
What a lucky guy you are!
Wedding is a big event in one's life,
you know?
Crab and his girl broke up for a long time.
And, his girl isn't called Baby.
Something's wrong! I'll go to save him.
Are we going down through the gutter?
You can't go, it's too dangerous.
Why?
I can't let you take any more risk.
If I don't come back in half hour,
you should leave here at once.
Let me look at your face.
Why?
Cause you promised me that.
You promise you'll keep this a secret.
Promise,
I won't even tell Tsui Chik, that nerd.
Sorry, I called you nerd.
Remember, you have to come back.
Don't worry, I'll be back.
I am leaving.
I'll wait for you for dinner.
Commander, download procedure
has reached the last stage.
Five more minutes to go.
Inform all the team members to
begin retreat in fifteen minutes.
Commander, we have unidentified object...
approaching section C at a high speed.
They are coming.
Commander, these are Heat Bombs.
They want to distract our attention.
So fast!
Sir, please stay and enjoy yourself.
I have a present for you.
You will soon become minced meat.
Cause the bomb will explode soon.
You've said once.
How long?
Only two minutes left, you'd better run.
We still have time.
Either be quick,
or leave at once.
Do you have a pager?
Pager?
It is ticking faster than my heart beat.
Let's leave by different routes.
No!
Coach,
I have over estimated you.
What is the difference
between you and a pig?
Man or pig,
one deserves to die
if he despises his own species.
You are worse than a pig,
you deserve to die.
Poisonous gas!
You can't leave now.
Let's see for how much longer
can you hold your breath.
Has the police information been
completely downloaded yet?
Let me deplete your blood.
Is your heart beating slower and slower?
Your blood is almost completely depleted.
Even if I don't kill you,
you will die of heart failure.
Just like the General.
I've got the information.
Don't take my disc.
You want to get it? Come here.
Run for your life!
Sorry for all the trouble.
From now on, it's all up to you.
You're welcome.
Thank you for your white outfit.
I guess this is the only way
to send you away.
I hope when I see you again,
if I punch you, you'll be able
to feel the pain.
I am determined to repair my feeling,
whatever it takes,
I am sure I can find someone
who can cure me.
Well, I guess it's time now.
The boat's leaving.
Wait.
Let's get our picture together.
Please!
- Sorry to trouble you sir.
- OK.
One, two, three.
