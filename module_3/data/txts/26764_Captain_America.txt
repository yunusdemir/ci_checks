JOE RUSSO: <i>Welcome to
the DVD commentary</i>
<i>for</i> Captain America Civil War.
<i>I'm Joe Russo.</i>
ANTHONY RUSSO: <i>I'm Anthony Russo.</i>
CHRISTOPHER MARKUS:
<i>I'm Chris Markus.</i>
STEPHEN McFEELY:
<i>And I'm Steve McFeely.</i>
JOE: <i>And we...</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Should we
do that over, guys?</i>
McFEELY: <i>No... You didn't like that?</i>
JOE: <i>Yeah.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Just kidding.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Somebody...</i>
ANTHONY: <i>No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.</i>
JOE: <i>I was trying to come up with
a fake band name for us,</i>
<i>but I just... I wasn't quick enough.</i>
(McFEELY CHUCKLES)
ANTHONY: <i>All right,
so, the movie's playing.</i>
MARKUS: <i>I've seen this movie...</i>
McFEELY: <i>Oh, that movie.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah.</i>
JOE: <i>Uh, so, we talk a little bit
about Bucky's backstory.</i>
<i>Anybody have anything?</i>
MARKUS: <i>Well, he went
through hard times</i>
<i>and this is just a little taste
of how much it sucked to be Bucky.</i>
JOE: <i>And how he was treated
in the facility he was kept in.</i>
McFEELY: <i>I mean, this
an example of how many, uh...</i>
<i>The first of many decisions
about how to present</i>
<i>all the many plot strands we had.</i>
JOE: <i>Right.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Right?</i>
<i>I mean, 'cause it's a flashback
that starts the movie.</i>
<i>That then forces you to jump,
you know, a couple time periods.</i>
<i>And I believe... And we certainly tried
other places for this,</i>
<i>-but there was just no way to really...</i>
-MARKUS: <i>Yeah.</i>
<i>Longing</i>
<i>-but there was just no way to really...</i>
-MARKUS: <i>Yeah.</i>
<i>We also danced around for a while
in terms of a MacGuffin...</i>
<i>Rusted</i>
<i>We also danced around for a while
in terms of a MacGuffin...</i>
<i>Seventeen</i>
<i>This red notebook.</i>
<i>Daybreak</i>
<i>This red notebook.</i>
<i>'Cause I think we wanted to connect it</i>
<i>Furnace</i>
<i>more to what
you're watching right now,</i>
<i>Nine</i>
<i>which is his, sort of, brain control chair
from</i> Winter Soldier.
<i>Benign</i>
<i>which is his, sort of, brain control chair
from</i> Winter Soldier.
<i>Homecoming</i>
<i>which is his, sort of, brain control chair
from</i> Winter Soldier.
MARKUS: <i>There were many drafts
where they were chasing</i>
<i>One</i>
MARKUS: <i>There were many drafts
where they were chasing</i>
<i>-something called the mind crown.</i>
-(LAUGHTER)
<i>Freight car</i>
MARKUS: <i>Which was basically,
that thing that goes over his head.</i>
McFEELY: <i>That's right. That's right</i>
MARKUS: <i>And then
somebody very wisely went,</i>
<i>"Couldn't it just be like a notebook
with some words in it?"</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Will you guys talk about
the word sequence?</i>
Good morning, Soldier.
ANTHONY: <i>Will you guys talk about
the word sequence?</i>
<i>'Cause Joe and I get that question
a lot and we always...</i>
Ready to comply.
MARKUS: <i>It was deliberately chosen.</i>
<i>Everything he says is the title of
a forthcoming Marvel movie.</i>
I have a mission for you.
<i>Everything he says is the title of
a forthcoming Marvel movie.</i>
(McFEELY CHUCKLES)
McFEELY: <i>Um, I think we picked
Russian words that sounded...</i>
Sanction and extract.
McFEELY: <i>Um, I think we picked
Russian words that sounded...</i>
JOE: <i>Interesting.</i>
No witnesses.
McFEELY: <i>Yeah, and had
some chewiness to it.</i>
JOE: <i>Yeah.</i>
McFEELY: <i>And then,
even when you read them,</i>
<i>it wasn't, you know,
kittens and puppies.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Yeah.</i>
McFEELY: <i>It's something...</i>
MARKUS: <i>Obliterate.</i>
McFEELY: <i>...that had
a connotation to it.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>So, you guys were
really thinking about</i>
<i>how it sounded in Russian?</i>
McFEELY: <i>A little bit, yeah.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Right, yeah.</i>
McFEELY: <i>To be fair, I think</i>
<i>everthing in Russian
sounds interesting.</i>
MARKUS: <i>I think it was also about
how it sounded in...</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Right.</i>
MARKUS: <i>How it read in English</i>
<i>to make you think you were watching
something cool.</i>
(ANTHONY CHUCKLES)
JOE: <i>So, this is probably the...</i>
<i>One of the more subversive things
that we did in the movie. Which is...</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah, we ruin
a beautiful vintage Cadillac.</i>
JOE: <i>That's right.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>It's very subversive.</i>
<i>Broke my heart.</i>
JOE: <i>But this plot point that we
had to try and make you believe</i>
<i>was actually what
the movie was about.</i>
<i>That it was not about
who was in the car,</i>
<i>but it was about what was
in the trunk of the car.</i>
Well done Soldier.
<i>but it was about what was
in the trunk of the car.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Yeah.</i>
JOE: <i>Uh, and that these
blue gel packs</i>
<i>were, uh, gonna become
a key story point.</i>
<i>Which implies a more traditional
structure for a superhero film.</i>
<i>Because those blue gel packs
can create super soldiers.</i>
<i>Um, and a lot of work went into...</i>
<i>The two things, I think,
were the hardest in the script</i>
<i>were that misdirect and balancing
Cap and Tony throughout the movie</i>
<i>to make sure that each felt
like they had an equal voice in the film.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Yeah.</i>
JOE: <i>And equally represented</i>
<i>in terms of their point of view.</i>
<i>So that by the time
you got to the end of the movie,</i>
<i>you are left with
a very complicated choice to make.</i>
<i>You couldn't tell who was wrong
and who was right.</i>
<i>And that, you know, hopefully,
you do leave the theater</i>
<i>and argue with your friends and family
about who is wrong and who is right.</i>
MARKUS: <i>I would just like to say
I love Wanda's chipped nail polish.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>That's a really good thing
about the shot.</i>
JOE: <i>Real method.</i>
WANDA: (ON RADIO)
<i>It's a good target.</i>
There's an ATM on the south corner,
which means?
Cameras.
<i>Both cross streets are one-way.</i>
So, compromised escape routes.
STEVE: Means our guy doesn't
care about being seen.
He isn't afraid to make a mess
on the way out.
JOE: <i>Why don't we talk a little bit
about the development process on this.</i>
<i>Uh, go back to the beginning.</i>
McFEELY: <i>The beginning-beginning.</i>
JOE: <i>When there was no civil war.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Right.</i>
JOE: <i>It was basically...</i>
Winter Soldier <i>had just come out.</i>
<i>Kevin had approached the four of us</i>
<i>and said,
"You guys wanna do another one?"</i>
-McFEELY: <i>Fast.</i>
-(LAUGHTER)
JOE: <i>And we all said "yes. </i>
<i>And you know, he said,
"Okay, great, what do you wanna do?"</i>
<i>And then we spent months in a room</i>
<i>going through ideas,
one of which was...</i>
McFEELY: <i>What're you
leading me towards?</i>
JOE: <i>The mad bomb.</i>
McFEELY: <i>The mad bomb?</i>
McFEELY: <i>We certainly...</i>
<i>You know, the biggest thread
was the Bucky search.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Yeah.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Right, and so that...</i>
<i>And that remained.
Much of that remained in</i> Civil War.
<i>But what we were pursuing was,</i>
<i>somebody tries to flush
Bucky out of hiding</i>
<i>because only Bucky
had a secret that</i>
<i>was, um, 50 years old
or what have you.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Which had...</i>
<i>I mean, it was gratifying that it lived
inside</i> Civil War
<i>because it had good things in it.</i>
<i>Um, but it just came to nothing.</i>
<i>It, literally, came to somebody robbing
the stock market.</i>
McFEELY: <i>That's right.
It was a very traditional third act.</i>
MARKUS: <i>It was so disheartening
when we got to that third act.</i>
<i>It was like, "Oh, it's about money."</i>
JOE: <i>Another one of these.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Yeah, another one of these.</i>
JOE: <i>That, I think, is what was
appealing to all of us about</i> Civil War,
<i>is that the inherent structure of it
could be subversive</i>
<i>and could deconstruct the genre.</i>
<i>Um, and I think, um, we had
some story elements</i>
<i>that, you know, we were able
to pull threads from other movies</i>
<i>to create the core
emotional arc of this movie.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Right.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah.</i>
MARKUS: <i>But what was nice
was that we knew</i>
<i>Bucky had killed Tony's parents.</i>
<i>And as long as we had Bucky,</i>
<i>it was almost like there was
this unbelievable fact</i>
<i>that we can either completely ignore,</i>
<i>which seems like such a waste,</i>
<i>or it's gonna blow up
whatever plot we're..</i>.
<i>If we're talking about
taking over the stock market,</i>
<i>you can't talk about killing
Tony's parents,</i>
<i>'cause then you're gonna kill your plot.</i>
<i>So, it was lovely
when we got to do</i> Civil War
<i>and suddenly the thing
we were avoiding got to be central...</i>
JOE: <i>The primary issue of the movie.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Yeah. Right.</i>
JOE: <i>And, you know, just...</i>
Ultron <i>was being worked on
while we were working on the script.</i>
<i>So, we all got to see a screening of it
and then when we realized</i>
<i>Oh, Tony could have incredible guilt
coming out of that movie.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Yeah.</i>
JOE: <i>That there
could be culpability for him,</i>
<i>that there could be culpability
for the Avengers.</i>
<i>Well, how does the world feel about
what just happened in that movie?</i>
<i>The fact that in</i> Winter Soldier,
<i>we had a sequence</i>
<i>where you saw, where it was implied,</i>
<i>that Bucky had something to do
with the murder of the Starks.</i>
<i>And that Cap hadn't said anything yet
about it.</i>
<i>So, there was a few elements.</i>
<i>And I think</i> Civil War <i>is,
and people have said this, the, um...</i>
<i>"It's the movie most dependent upon
everything that has come before it."</i>
McFEELY: <i>Certainly.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah.</i>
JOE: <i>In order... You have to have seen
a number of the Marvel movies</i>
<i>to understand this movie.</i>
McFEELY: <i>It is richer
for that experience.</i>
<i>I mean, it's a thing unique in film
at this moment which is...</i>
<i>I mean, part of this...
I like this movie, I think it's great.</i>
<i>It's 'cause everyone did good work.</i>
<i>But it's also because good work was
done in 10 or 12 movies beforehand</i>
<i>-that we got to pull on.</i>
-MARKUS: <i>Mmm-hmm.</i>
<i>We even got to, uh, enrich...</i>
<i>I think this movie actually enriches,
looking backwards,</i>
<i>some of the other movies where,
you know,</i>
<i>plot lines are
picked back up again</i>
(STUTTERS) <i>and the
ramifications are dealt with.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah, that's a good point.</i>
JOE: <i>Yeah, the threads
are coming from a lot different films.</i>
<i>And they're heading forward
into a lot of different movies as well.</i>
MARKUS: <i>By the way, I just heard...</i>
<i>Well, not literally just now.</i>
<i>That this building, which is the
Atlanta Civic Center posing as Lagos,</i>
<i>has been torn down.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Oh, my!</i>
MARKUS: <i>It is no longer there.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Wow!</i>
McFEELY: <i>And it's also MIT.</i>
JOE: <i>That's a bit of a heartbreak.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Yeah, it's a nice building.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>And it stands in
for MIT as well. Yeah.</i>
<i>No, this building looked like it was</i>
<i>gonna be on the verge
of being torn down</i>
<i>while we shot there,
so not surprised to hear that.</i>
JOE: <i>Something that is
interesting about the film,</i>
<i>and I think something
that we were excited about</i>
<i>when we all stumbled on the concept
for</i> Civil War,
<i>is that this is a unique kind
of storytelling.</i>
<i>And it's not something you can do
unless you have a cinematic universe,</i>
<i>a healthy cinematic universe,
that has a lot of movies before it.</i>
<i>Which just basically allows us
to focus on character interaction.</i>
<i>For a majority of the film, um,
we don't have to do set up.</i>
<i>This movie is impossible if you have to
set up every character in the film.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Right.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Right.</i>
JOE: <i>If you had to follow
a traditional,</i>
<i>you know, cinematic structure</i>
<i>or what we've come to know
as a, you know...</i>
McFEELY: <i>Right.</i>
JOE: <i>A two, two and a half hour
closed-ended experience.</i>
<i>-We could've never made this movie.</i>
-McFEELY: <i>Right.</i>
MARKUS: <i>And what was
nice was we didn't even,</i>
<i>just 'cause of the way
the story's being told,</i>
<i>we didn't have to do backstory
on the new characters, either.</i>
<i>Because we have one that people
have seen five movies about</i>
<i>and one who isn't necessarily
a mystery in the movie itself.</i>
<i>So, being Panther, couldn't explain
too much about him beforehand, so...</i>
CROSSBONES: Take this to the airstrip.
We're not gonna outrun them.
Lose the truck.
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)
Where are you going to meet us?
I'm not. (GRUNTS)
I've got four, they're splitting up.
I got the two on the left.
(PANICKED CHATTER)
JOE: <i>Let's talk about our support team
for a second here.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Yeah.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Speaking of the,
yeah, stunts...</i>
<i>Heidi Moneymaker, who is Black
Widow's stunt double in this sequence,</i>
<i>she has some amazing work here.</i>
JOE: <i>Who did us
a real solid by coming in</i>
<i>and helping us with some of the action.</i>
<i>A movie of this scale is immense.</i>
<i>So, we did have some compression
in the schedule</i>
<i>and we needed some help
to get these things done.</i>
<i>But we do have
an incredible stunt team</i>
<i>that is carried over from</i> Winter Soldier
<i>into this movie,</i>
<i>who really,
there's an example right there...</i>
<i>Who really take a lot of
very physical hits</i>
<i>in order for us to get that visceral...</i>
<i>You know, "you feel the punches"
quality to the action.</i>
<i>And I just wanted to give a shout-out
to them for that</i>
<i>and for all the, you know,
really inventive...</i>
<i>Here's another example, right here...</i>
<i>The really inventive work that they do
choreographing these fights.</i>
<i>This is one of my favorite fights
I think I've ever seen,</i>
<i>and this was choreographed
by our Stunt Department</i>
<i>and Chad and Dave as well.</i>
MARKUS: <i>And what's amazing is
when we watch the stunt viz of this,</i>
<i>this isn't sped up, there are no effects.</i>
<i>Heidi just does these things.</i>
<i>She can swing around a person's head
and smack somebody else.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Well, it's amazing.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>It is amazing.</i>
<i>And this, by the way,
was shot in Atlanta in the summer</i>
<i>even though it doesn't look like Atlanta.</i>
<i>But it was extremely hot.</i>
<i>It was extremely hard conditions
to shoot something</i>
<i>where you're this physically active
and aggressive.</i>
JOE: <i>Uh, but this being set</i>
<i>in Atlanta is a good segue
into our incredible visual effects team</i>
<i>who put Lagos in around us.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Mmm-hmm.</i>
JOE: (STUTTERING)
<i>So, that we could work in Atlanta,</i>
<i>you know, in a very specific location</i>
<i>that would allow us to get more time.</i>
<i>Where we could spend more time
and money on the fight sequences</i>
<i>and on getting, um, great
character work out of the actors</i>
<i>instead of moving to a different location
where we'd spend a lot more money,</i>
<i>you have to move the crew.</i>
<i>So it was a real credit to them
for all the work that they do</i>
<i>that I think the people don't see.</i>
<i>-Don't know that is their work.</i>
-McFEELY: <i>Yeah.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>As well as our production
designer, Owen Paterson.</i>
<i>I mean, what you're seeing here,</i>
<i>this is just a big empty pit
in an industrial area in Atlanta, so...</i>
<i>The whole market,
all the buildings in the market,</i>
<i>that was all developed and built
by our production design team,</i>
<i>and like Joe was saying,</i>
<i>everything surrounding that
is all by our visual effects team</i>
<i>and it all ends up turning Atlanta
into Lagos.</i>
JOE: <i>They're real, what we call
plates of Lagos,</i>
<i>meaning we sent a photographer
or camera crew over there</i>
<i>that took footage of Lagos</i>
<i>and then our VFX team reconstitutes
that or uses that as a template,</i>
<i>you know,
for a three-dimensional world</i>
<i>that they create
and then put around the characters.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Maybe it's time
to talk about</i> Civil War.
<i>-The comic versus the film.</i>
-JOE: <i>Sure.</i>
McFEELY: <i>As in</i> Winter Soldier,
<i>everybody always wanted to start with
a Lemurian Star sequence, you know,</i>
<i>or even James Bond
is a good example.</i>
<i>The eight-minute kickass
action sequence.</i>
<i>But as opposed to some James Bonds
where it's clearly a different story,</i>
<i>we definitely wanted,
as in</i> Winter Soldier,
<i>for it to have something...</i>
<i>Couldn't afford for it not to have
something to do with the plot.</i>
<i>And so, in this case, it's basically,
this movie's Stamford Incident.</i>
<i>In the comic books, some heroes
that you may or may not know,</i>
<i>you know, accidently trigger an
explosion that blows up a school.</i>
<i>And therefore the reign of God
comes down on them</i>
<i>and every country on Earth
says you have to be registered.</i>
<i>-Um, this is our version of that.</i>
-MARKUS: <i>Mmm-hmm.</i>
McFEELY: <i>And hopefully has got
character consequences to it,</i>
<i>particularly for Wanda in this case.</i>
MARKUS: <i>I would just like to point out</i>
<i>in this scene,
that is not a special effect.</i>
<i>-That's Robert's brother, Jerry Downey.</i>
-(LAUGHTER)
MARKUS: <i>This young man
looks remarkably like him.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Well, I will note this.</i>
<i>Hope Davis and Robert Downey Jr.
are almost the same age.</i>
<i>One year separates the two of them.</i>
JOE: <i>So, again, credit goes
to our visual effects team.</i>
<i>This was the last shot
that was dropped into the movie.</i>
<i>You know, about two weeks before
it was seen on-screen...</i>
<i>Maybe a week and a half
before it was seen on-screen.</i>
<i>So, a lot of work by Lola,
a visual effects company,</i>
<i>was put into this shot.</i>
<i>We didn't do them any favors
by delivering them a oner.</i>
McFEELY: <i>That's right. That's right.</i>
JOE: <i>But that was the intent...</i>
<i>Was we wanted this to feel
like a stage play.</i>
<i>So, it would have that kind of...</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Throwback feel.</i>
JOE: <i>Throwback feel to it.</i>
<i>The emotion of that.</i>
<i>But, also, to be from the perspective
of the MIT audience</i>
<i>that's actually watching this being...</i>
<i>You know,
this is a projection on a stage,</i>
<i>so, subliminally,
you have the same effect</i>
<i>where you're almost a voyeur
or a proscenium...</i>
<i>It's being presented to you
in a proscenium.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Is that why you
wanted to do it in the one?</i>
JOE: <i>Yeah... We just wanted...</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah.</i>
JOE: <i>Because ultimately, it is a trick.</i>
McFEELY: <i>I love it. Okay.</i>
MARKUS: <i>It's also
Robert's last shot, right?</i>
<i>'Cause he had to shave the beard
in order to shoot it.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Yes. That's right.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>That's right.</i>
<i>But there's also something
about this scene being</i>
<i>like sort of period dysfunctional family.</i>
<i>It was just kind of</i>
Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?
McFEELY: <i>This is</i> Ordinary People <i>here.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah, exactly.</i>
<i>So, there's a lot of things pushing us
to that sort of tone in that oner.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Gotcha. Yeah.</i>
MARKUS: <i>And then
this developed differently.</i>
<i>I mean, this originally was a flashback.</i>
JOE: <i>It was and then
we thought that the...</i>
<i>I think we all agree that the flashback
was just too traditional of a structure.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Yeah.</i>
JOE: <i>And, uh...</i>
MARKUS: <i>I mean,
Tony's the perfect character to...</i>
McFEELY: <i>Right. Robert had...
Robert definitely, you know...</i>
MARKUS: <i>Yeah.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Tony just
doesn't have flashbacks.</i>
(CHUCKLING) <i>He's kind of just,
you know, where's his tech?</i>
JOE: <i>Tony can make
the flashback real.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Yes. Yes.</i>
JOE: <i>Or he can show
the flashback to an audience.</i>
<i>You know, that's the fun thing
with Tony Stark,</i>
<i>is you can think big with the character</i>
<i>because of his money and his genius
and the technology at his disposal.</i>
<i>You can do a lot interesting things
with the character.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Like, for instance,
have a holographic teleprompter</i>
<i>-that hovers over the audience.</i>
-McFEELY: <i>Why wouldn't you?</i>
(CHUCKLING) <i>Right.</i>
MARKUS: <i>And this theater is the
inside of the Atlanta Civic Center,</i>
<i>which I appear to be obsessed with.</i>
(McFEELY CHUCKLES)
<i>Uh, the outside of which
was the Center for Disease Control.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Do you guys wanna talk
about, uh, Downey's performance?</i>
<i>This is the beginning of
a more mature, darker Tony Stark.</i>
JOE: <i>Yeah,
the intent in this movie...</i>
<i>Because we knew where we
were going with the character,</i>
that we had to motivate Tony to want
to kill Bucky Barnes in the third act
in order for the third act
to work correctly.
Uh, that Tony would have to be
off-balance.
And the way that we thought
we could make him off-balance
was by pulling things out of his life,
making him emotionally vulnerable...
Really emotionally vulnerable.
So, Pepper is out of his life.
It clearly is an issue for him, as you can
see, by Robert's performance here.
Uh, and not only that
but it's compounded by the fact
<i>that he is about to be confronted
by the mother of a boy</i>
<i>that died as part of collateral damage
in Sokovia.</i>
<i>And Tony is directly responsible
for Ultron, so he feels great guilt.</i>
<i>So,</i> (STUTTERS) <i>he's being attacked
emotionally on a lot of different fronts.</i>
<i>And it puts the character
in a precarious position.</i>
<i>So, as the movie progresses,
if there is a touchstone</i>
<i>or something cathartic
were to happen to him,</i>
<i>it could potentially push him
over the edge.</i>
<i>Which is what happens
at the end of the film.</i>
MARKUS: <i>And there's
something very satisfying</i>
<i>about the arc Tony Stark has taken
from the first movie on,</i>
<i>where, you know, his most
recognizable action in the first movie</i>
<i>is to stop making weapons</i>
<i>'cause, "The things I make
are hurting people."</i>
<i>And he gets all the way to this movie
and realizes,</i>
<i>"The things I make
are still hurting people."</i>
McFEELY: <i>(CHUCKLES) Right.</i>
MARKUS: <i>You know, it's...</i>
McFEELY: <i>No, he's responsible
for Ultron.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Yeah.</i>
McFEELY: <i>And we couldn't
just rely on that.</i>
<i>I mean,
I assume many people saw Ultron,</i>
<i>probably everyone in the audience did.</i>
<i>But just in terms of storytelling,</i>
<i>you want a scene
that crystalizes that issue.</i>
<i>And to not just have to rely
on your audience</i>
<i>remembering a year ago.</i>
JOE: <i>And this was influenced
by the scene from Jaws,</i>
<i>-where Brody is confronted...</i>
-McFEELY: <i>Right. Yeah, that's right.</i>
JOE: <i>By the mother of
a boy who was killed</i>
<i>in a shark attack, um,
off the shore.</i>
<i>And he now feels great guilt moving
forward in the movie because of it.</i>
<i>I think we have to really, um, give
a shout-out to Alfre Woodard here</i>
<i>for doing a, you know, very small part
in this movie, but a very integral part.</i>
<i>It was so important that the audience
feel the emotional impact of this</i>
<i>and to have an actress of her caliber
performing this for us</i>
<i>was an incredible gift and a real favor.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>It was Robert's
idea, actually, to cast her.</i>
<i>He brought her up for that role</i>
<i>'cause I think he knew how important
this scene would be for the character.</i>
McFEELY: <i>And even
on set it was pretty clear.</i>
<i>-"Oh, wow! Wow!"</i>
-(LAUGHTER)
JOE: <i>Exactly.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah.</i>
JOE: <i>You know, it was a...
And it was just, you know,</i>
<i>Robert is an incredibly big personality
on-screen</i>
<i>and you have to have an incredible
actor or actress opposite him</i>
<i>-to hold the screen.</i>
-McFEELY: <i>That's right.</i>
He does not talk much in that scene.
MARKUS: <i>No.</i>
McFEELY: <i>You know, yeah.</i>
MARKUS: <i>And here's our first
appearance of the Wakandans.</i>
...is no victory at all.
JOE: <i>It is a dense movie</i>
<i>and it's interesting that, you know,
this whole secretive nation</i>
<i>is introduced on Cap's
computer screen.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Mmm-hmm.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Right.</i>
JOE: <i>But it's very difficult to tell
this story and keep it on character</i>
<i>if we kept jumping
all over the world and...</i>
McFEELY: <i>No, we've
mentioned this before.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah.</i>
McFEELY: <i>I mean,
characters come in</i>
<i>when the story requires them
to come in.</i>
<i>We cannot have a scene</i>
<i>where T'Challa wakes up
one morning and his dad says,</i>
"Hey, time to fly to Vienna, "
or, you know...
Any character that's just
going about their business. This...
They can only come
when we need them to come in.
JOE: <i>Yeah, and tied
to the main plot of the story.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Yeah, exactly.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>So, I don't know
if anybody caught it,</i>
but some people think that Wanda's
brother is absent from the film,
but there is actually some child photos
over on the desk over there.
McFEELY: (CHUCKLES) Right.
JOE: <i>This was
a relationship</i>
we thought would be
important for the movie
as a patriarchal relationship.
Illustrating how Cap is the patriarch
or a patriarch of the Avengers
and I would say that Tony
is the other patriarch.
And the movie really is about what
happens when those two patriarchs
come into conflict with one another.
How does everyone choose
sides and why?
And typically, you tend to choose sides
in an argument for emotional reasons
or for philosophical reasons.
Um, Wanda certainly feels a closeness
to Steve.
Steve is a good person,
um, a good mentor.
Uh, and she does have
a hole in her life.
You know, her brother is gone.
And so she's looking for
an emotional connection to someone.
Tony is not necessarily a guy
that engenders emotional connection
with people.
McFEELY: Right.
ANTHONY: <i>We were trying to
create a sense of family here.</i>
Because, you know, in our minds
this movie was always
very much about
a family being torn apart.
MARKUS: <i>Mmm-hmm.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>A sort of notion of civil war</i>
that we have back from
the American Civil War
where families had to fight
on either side of the conflict.
Um, and in that scene,
we were trying to create...
Again, it's like you can't get more
family-like than somebody arguing
about when and how somebody
walks into their bedroom.
McFEELY: Right. Exactly.
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Right. Well,
the setting is important.</i>
JOE: <i>So, another bonus of working
in the Marvel Cinematic Universe</i>
is we knew we needed somebody
to represent the government in the film.
So, we could've either cast
an original part
or we could've used
one of the great actors...
-(LAUGHTER)
-McFEELY: <i>Of the last 40 years. Yeah.</i>
But also there's a little bit of a,
not a reclamation project,
but you wanna age the character up,
you wanna make 'em
a little bit more mature.
The tone of
Winter Soldier and Civil War
and very likely Infinity War
is, um, a little more grounded,
a little more realistic
and so taking the gruff
General Ross from The Hulk
and making him more of a statesman
was absolutely by design.
JOE: <i>Mmm-hmm.
His character has gone on a journey.</i>
It's off camera, but that's the part
of the fun of these movies
is how far can you move
the characters off camera,
so that when you sit in the theater,
you're surprised by the choices
that have been made.
MARKUS: <i>And yet it's still
in line with that character.</i>
He's still trying to control superheroes.
McFEELY: Yes.
MARKUS: <i>He's...
JOE: He's being smarter about it.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Yeah,
learned a better way to do it.</i>
And here is
the other big reason why
this movie sort of
wanted to be made,
was because we and everybody else
began to notice
the massive amount of destruction
at the end of these movies.
And do we just let that fly,
or do we say something about it?
And it seemed ripe...
JOE: <i>To examine it.
MARKUS: Yeah.</i>
JOE: <i>On a real world level.</i>
McFEELY: <i>I mean, it makes sense,
you know,</i>
if you put yourself
in the position of Marvel,
it makes sense to, to dance
with who brung ya, right?
If that movie is working and if the...
If the third act is,
we all get together and we...
Somebody's raining crap
down from the sky, that's fine.
But I think you say this a lot, Joe,
you know, if you give someone a flavor
of ice cream they love every day,
they're gonna eventually learn
to hate that ice cream.
JOE: <i>Right.</i>
McFEELY: <i>So, we have to reinvent
the structure or take risks structurally.</i>
So this is an examination
of the third act, you know.
MARKUS: <i>Well, it's also how you keep
this big of a...</i>
If you call all of Marvel a franchise,
how you keep it from feeling like
sequel, sequel, sequel, sequel
is, each movie has to be aware
of the one that came before it.
It has to evolve because of
what happened in the previous movie.
So, you can't keep committing the sins
of the prior movie.
ANTHONY: <i>It turns it
into serialized storytelling</i>
as opposed to sequelization.
MARKUS: <i>Yeah.
McFEELY: Yes.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Which I think is, obviously,
part of the appeal of the Marvel films.</i>
JOE: <i>And I know some people
had mentioned</i>
about the number of casualties...
McFEELY: <i>Are we soft pedaling it, or...</i>
JOE: <i>Soft pedaling...</i>
<i>Well, no, but actually they're called
civilian casualties,</i>
<i>so it is a reference to civilians,
which is not inclusive of...</i>
ANTHONY: <i>The bad guys.</i>
JOE: <i>Military personnel or police,
you know...</i>
Anybody else who
may have been engaged
(STUTTERS)
in one of the events
who were not civilians.
But that's... Ross's point here is that,
you know, we're not holding you
accountable for the other heroes,
the cops or military who may have
given their lives in these situations,
but we're holding you accountable
for the civilians who did.
MAN: I jumped the curb.
JOE: <i>This movie kind of has
parallel stories going on in it.</i>
(SNIFFLES) Zemo is off in his own story
because it's not clear to the audience
what he's up to
for quite some time in the film.
McFEELY: <i>Do we wanna cop to
the reshoot nature of this one?</i>
MARKUS: <i>Yeah.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Yeah.</i>
MARKUS: <i>This was...
We had an original scene</i>
where Zemo was
at an auction.
A black market auction.
And that's how he got his hands
on the book, was at this auction.
And he killed everybody in the auction
by gassing the auction.
But we just didn't get
enough story out of him.
It was too mysterious
of an opening scene. It was...
ANTHONY: <i>It wasn't specific enough,</i>
either to who Zemo was
as a villain, you know.
McFEELY: <i>It did not connect him
to the opening of the movie, uh, cleanly.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah.</i>
McFEELY: <i>And this one does.</i>
-You'll get the red book, you get...
-JOE: <i>Karpov.</i>
McFEELY: <i>You literally get Karpov
and perhaps the most important thing.</i>
JOE: <i>Right.</i>
McFEELY: <i>So you know you're
not watching a third strand of the movie.</i>
You're going back to something
that you already saw.
JOE: <i>And tonally,
it just felt more appropriate to us.</i>
This is loosely based on the notion
of John Demjanjuk,
who was, um, (SMACKS LIPS)
hiding out in Cleveland,
in Parma, Ohio.
Um, um...
McFEELY: <i>And he
was a camp... He was a prison...</i>
-He was a concentration camp officer.
-ANTHONY: <i>Yeah.</i>
Yeah, he was a retired auto worker
that they somehow discovered
had been a former concentration
camp guard named Ivan the Terrible.
And it was... There was
a big controversy in the late '80s
about whether or not to deport him
to Israel for trial
and they did eventually, but it was just
this notion of the fact that
when after the war Nazis go into
hiding like Boys in Brazil,
whether it be South America
or whatever parts of the world
they go into hiding in,
we were always playing
with a similar idea with HYDRA.
You know, some of HYDRA
shows up here in the States,
some shows up in Russia,
-some in Sokovia, et cetera.
-MARKUS: <i>Mmm-hmm.</i>
JOE: <i>But when you scatter
and Karpov is in hiding and...</i>
McFEELY: <i>But, yeah, I mean,
you know, I remember doing it.</i>
<i>Chose Cleveland not only
as a shout-out to you guys,</i>
<i>but because it's got maybe one of
the top 20 Russian populations</i>
<i>-in the United States.</i>
-JOE: <i>Right.</i>
McFEELY: <i>So, you hide, but you hide
someplace you can still order food.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>That was a cool idea
on your part.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Well, it's also,
you know...</i>
This is an example of
the grounded nature. They don't...
The HYDRA didn't scatter and
each form a terrorist cell, you know...
McFEELY: <i>Right.
MARKUS: Build ray guns.</i>
This guy's clearly kind of a fat drunk
in Cleveland. So, it's... (CHUCKLING)
JOE: <i>Who boarded up his house
and has a gun by the door</i>
and clearly doesn't leave a lot.
He's probably a hoarder,
you know, who gets
his groceries delivered
and doesn't want people
to see his face.
He's living out his life in fear now
because there are documents
that were released
by Cap and Natasha in Winter Soldier
that include information about him.
And so, he's a wanted man
and there are probably
bounty hunters looking for him.
ANTHONY: <i>I mean, this whole plot...</i>
The whole plot of this movie is
in a lot of ways driven by that,
when... That moment
at the end of Winter Soldier
where Black Widow uploads all of
the HYDRA files onto the Internet.
So, presumably, people have been
combing over those files
for a couple years now.
And, um, you know,
just like the Snowden file,
sometimes you find
a needle in a haystack
and you start to put a narrative together
about what's going on and that's really
how Zemo is doing what he's doing.
He's paying a lot of attention
to those things,
he's very driven on an emotional level
and he's finding clues
that other people haven't found yet
because of that.
McFEELY: <i>It's the man with experience</i>
meets a man with
the desire to do this, right?
So, I mean, in many ways,
an everyman could have done this
if he knew how to murder
people. (CHUCKLES)
MARKUS: <i>Shout-out to Vision's
sweater vest here.</i>
Well, actually not a vest,
it's a full sweater.
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah.</i>
JOE: <i>The intent with that
was that</i>
Vision is trying to discover
how he fits in.
He wants to assimilate,
he's looking for an identity,
um, he doesn't want
to be a singular entity.
He wants to see if he can access
humanity in some way.
McFEELY: <i>Now, do you imagine
he is creating these</i>
out of his very fiber
or is he shopping?
JOE: <i>I think he's creating these outfits.
ANTHONY: Creating them. Yeah.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Right.</i>
MARKUS: <i>The fact of the matter is,
Vision is always naked.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Right.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Everything is made
from his skin.</i>
-It's a projection.
-JOE: <i>Yes.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Paul Bettany always puts it
a way I love it.</i>
He thinks of it as Vision
is trying to understand humanity.
That's his sort of mission.
And, like, it's an interesting
organizing principle
when you think about the character.
JOE: <i>He was created
to protect humanity.</i>
This is great.
We did a lot of work early on
with Robert
about the character
and our big pitch to him,
because he was not contracted
to do this movie...
We had to go to him
and pitch him the film
and get him
creatively vested in the film,
was that we were gonna take a very
different approach with Tony Stark.
That we were gonna make
the character off-balance
and emotionally vulnerable
and, uh, insensitive
and that, you know, he's going to be
in a real place of confusion.
MARKUS: <i>Mmm-hmm.</i>
JOE: <i>He's dealing with emotions
that he hasn't had to deal with before.</i>
And that his moral center
and his narcissism
are coming into conflict
with each other.
And he has to make a choice
to submit his ego to the government.
McFEELY: <i>And I think
that's being responsible</i>
to the movies that have come before.
I mean, you know, you can't blow off
things like Ultron.
If you do, then you are
just spinning your wheels.
JOE: <i>Right.
You're just making movies...</i>
McFEELY: <i>If he doesn't
learn from his mistakes,</i>
we will eventually get sick of him.
MARKUS: <i>Right. And in
this exact same scene,</i>
Steve is learning from,
not exactly his mistakes,
but he's learning from his last movie.
So, everyone is the product
of where you just saw them.
JOE: <i>And what's interesting
is they're changing positions.</i>
He and Cap have crossed.
McFEELY: <i>Yes.
They've crossed in a way.</i>
JOE: <i>They've do-si-do'd their arcs,</i>
where the narcissist
and the anti-authoritarian
is now willing to submit
to government authority
and the chain of command guy...
McFEELY: <i>Team player. Yeah.</i>
JOE: <i>Now wants nothing to do with it.</i>
Because he can't trust
power structures.
ANTHONY: <i>You know, one thing
that this scene makes me think of,</i>
and many other moments in the movie,
is like, you know, you guys have been
responsible for creating
several of these characters
and voicing them as writers,
but also, the work that you guys do
with inheriting other characters
and cracking their voice as writers
is always amazing to Joe and I.
We love how you're able to do that
and I can go through the whole cast
about how, you know...
-Well, you guys...
-McFEELY: <i>Please do. Would you talk...</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Would you guys
just talk for a minute</i>
about like what that process is like,
like the difference between voicing
characters you've created,
-and as far as inheriting characters?
-McFEELY: <i>Oh, sure.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Well, it was such a pleasure
to finally get Tony aka Robert</i>
because he's essentially
everything Steve isn't.
Steve doesn't say anything
that he doesn't...
Hasn't thought about and believe.
And Robert/Tony says everything,
and you have to find
the nugget in all the jokes
and the constant self-referencing.
So, it was almost like
an entirely unused portion
-of the dialog skill set...
-McFEELY: <i>Right. Right, we...</i>
MARKUS: <i>...that just was cut
out of the Cap movies</i>
'cause he doesn't behave that way.
JOE: <i>What about Natasha?
She's coming up in a minute here.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Well, I mean,
I think we all feel</i>
that perhaps the consummate
Natasha is in Winter Soldier,
right, this... But she's part of this arc
that's gone from the shadows
and being basically a spy,
a person who trades in lies.
And has come out, right?
She sits in front of a national panel
(CHUCKLING) and tells the government
to kiss her ass, right?
She's the leader of the Avengers
in many ways.
MARKUS: <i>She's tricky to write though,</i>
because she doesn't, and Scarlet's
very good at calling us on it, is...
-She doesn't tell jokes, she isn't...
-McFEELY: <i>No.</i>
MARKUS: <i>...all that
deliberately funny or anything,</i>
so, all your writerly ticks
of giving somebody a smart remark
or a sarcastic response to something...
She just doesn't do that
because she is more of a cipher.
She doesn't want to give...
It's double agent training.
She's not gonna give anything away
that she doesn't want to be revealed.
McFEELY: <i>Right.</i>
JOE: <i>She also,
in this movie, I think,</i>
she has the most
mature point of view
-of any of the characters.
-McFEELY: <i>Right. Yeah.</i>
Right. She can see both sides
in a way that not everyone else can
which was the goal of...
We wanted everyone to have
a really solid basis
for why they're doing what they're doing
and then for the audience
to walk out of there completely split.
And she is sort of
that middle ground of maturity.
JOE: <i>Well, what's fascinating
about her is she is a reformed villain.</i>
-You know, so, she really...
-McFEELY: <i>Right.</i>
JOE: <i>She has
an understanding of life</i>
in a way that
other characters don't
or she has an empathy, I think.
Um, and it's really illustrated
very well in this scene,
which is to me, one of my favorite
performance scenes in the movie.
McFEELY: <i>This is the church scene?
ANTHONY: Yeah.</i>
JOE: <i>This is the scene
between the two...</i>
McFEELY: <i>So, I have
directing questions here.</i>
Because this is great.
It's all from below,
I assume because of the windows,
-but also because of...
-JOE: <i>Those were helpful.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Well, yeah,
but, I mean, is it, uh...</i>
Can you talk about that?
Is it just you found a window
and said, "I'm gonna use it"?
Or how do you justify, um, this angle
throughout the whole scene,
you know, 'cause it works great.
But I didn't know it would work great.
It looks great.
JOE: <i>It has to do with tone and what
you're trying to say with the characters.</i>
-This an off-angle eyeline.
-McFEELY: <i>Mmm-hmm.</i>
JOE: <i>So we're off to the left
on Cap here.</i>
We're not directly
in their eyeline and...
ANTHONY: <i>This is a very off-angle
here, which is great.</i>
JOE: <i>Yeah. And it's a...
Because we were off-angle and lower,</i>
we knew that when she moved in
closer to him
that we would get a tighter two-shot
out of it.
McFEELY: <i>Yeah.</i>
JOE: <i>But it would be
a more abstract two-shot.</i>
But there's a sense of intimacy here,
coming up from the vulnerability,
uh, shooting from
underneath a character.
Typically, when you want, you know,
to make people available to you,
you can look up at them.
When you want to diminish them,
you get the camera above them
and look down on them.
McFEELY: <i>Are we allowed to be
more intimate because it's off-angle?</i>
Like it's not...
So, it's not in my face or is...
JOE: <i>Yes, I think so, and it's less...</i>
ANTHONY: <i>I think it does create a little
bit of... Yeah, it gives your eye...</i>
You know, it puts you in a slightly
more unconventional space
when you're looking at it.
So, I think you're open to
what's happening in a different way
when you just sort of drift off
of what the convention is. Yeah.
MARKUS: <i>You're spying on them.
McFEELY: I'm spying on them. Okay.</i>
JOE: <i>Yeah, and if they're
more a traditional close-up, then...</i>
McFEELY: <i>It'd feel like a soap opera.
JOE: It does.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Okay.</i>
JOE: <i>And your expectation
is that it will be emotional</i>
because we're on longer lenses
and we're right in their face
-and she's...
-McFEELY: <i>Right.</i>
JOE: <i>She's dirty
in the frame on his side.</i>
Meaning, by dirty, I mean that
she's edging the frame with her hair.
And blurry and, you know...
So, it's a more traditional way
to execute a scene
which also may make your brain
lazier as you watch the scene.
McFEELY: <i>Gotcha.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>I think the central question
of that scene is like,</i>
"Are these two characters
going to connect?"
McFEELY: <i>Right.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>It's sort of a way to almost
hold back that connection in a way</i>
until they finally make
a very unexpected connection
-at the end of the scene.
-McFEELY: <i>Right.</i>
MARKUS: <i>I should say this
is Chadwick Boseman.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Yes.</i>
MARKUS: <i>The dawn of
the Black Panther, which is...</i>
I mean, this is pretty much how
Wakanda always entered the movie.
And we weren't even always sure that
Panther himself would be in the film.
And we weren't even always sure that
Panther himself would be in the film.

without, uh, the costume change.
without, uh, the costume change.
Because they fit... Again,
that the plot and the story called for
these people to be there
whether or not they were superheroes.
JOE: <i>As we're developing it,
the concept of the movie is binary.</i>
'Cause there's Tony's side
and there's Cap's side.
And why T'Challa became important
is he's a free radical.
Right, so he's a guy who's motivated,
extremely, for revenge.
Uh, but it has nothing to do
with the main plot of the film.
Because he has a very specific story
that could hopefully stir up
the two-faction rut...
McFEELY: <i>Right. Yeah. Absolutely.</i>
JOE: <i>That the
movie would have fallen into.</i>
McFEELY: <i>I mean,
we all knew very early on</i>
that if we had the same argument
six times, we failed.
JOE: <i>Right.
McFEELY: We've failed the story.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah, and he's also very...</i>
He complicates things for both sides
of the equation, too,
because he is pursuing
his own agenda,
but it directly affects
Tony's point of view
and Cap's point of view in many ways.
And I think that was also useful
in the storytelling
because look, fundamentally
we all know Tony and Cap as heroes.
So, to get them to a place where
they're really mad at each other
and having problems
with one another...
You know, I think having other things
going on in the plot
and complicating their situations
was helpful to get them to that place.
This was one of them.
JOE: <i>I think we really
have to commend Chadwick Boseman</i>
because with very limited screen time
in this movie,
he crafted a very emotional,
dimensional character
that is very different than anyone else
in the Marvel Universe.
It's not dissimilar to the job
that Sebastian Stan had
-in the Winter Soldier.
-McFEELY: <i>Right.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Here we have
Peggy's great grandniece</i>
or just grandniece or great niece?
ANTHONY: <i>Great niece...
MARKUS: Sharon Carter.</i>
The relationship
where some people go, "Ew."
ANTHONY: <i>That's one thing I noticed.
MARKUS: But then we went like,</i>
"No, he kissed her once
and she's his grandniece."
-It's all perfectly above board.
-JOE: <i>Yeah.</i>
JOE: <i>He kissed Peggy once.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>But one thing...
JOE: Let's clarify that,</i>
he kissed Peggy once.
ANTHONY: <i>One thing I
did notice, she's only...</i>
In our minds,
it was always grandniece, right?
-But in the movie...
-McFEELY: <i>Yeah, it just says niece.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>There's no...
It just says niece.</i>
So, there's nothing that explicitly
identifies her as a grandniece.
MARKUS: <i>There had been
a conversation</i>
in a cut scene where it
delved more into the exact lines,
apparently.
ANTHONY: <i>That's right.
JOE: Where she explained the lineage.</i>
JOE: <i>And I think that people have
to remember prior to Cap realizing this,</i>
-he had asked her out.
-McFEELY: <i>Yes.</i>
JOE: <i>On a date
in the Winter Soldier.</i>
So, he clearly is attracted to her.
And, uh...
ANTHONY: <i>Because of her
obvious resemblance to Peggy.</i>
-MARKUS: <i>(CHUCKLES) Exactly.
-(LAUGHTER)</i>
McFEELY: <i>Why'd you make it weird?
ANTHONY: (CHUCKLING) Sorry.</i>
MARKUS: <i>We should say,
"Rest in peace, Peggy Carter."</i>
McFEELY: <i>Yeah. That's right.</i>
JOE: <i>Okay, so, this is...</i>
We're gonna talk about the
emotional core of the movie.
This is when we knew
we could make Civil War
and I don't remember where,
you know, who came up with it or how...
Maybe you guys have
a better memOry for this,
but when we realized that
we could put Winter Soldier
at the center of the conflict
between Cap and Tony,
we knew we had a movie,
because as Steve mentioned earlier,
if the movie was about the characters
arguing about a political, you know, plot
over and over again,
the audience would've been bored
after 10 minutes.
They would've shut down.
MARKUS: <i>We also knew
we had the great revelation</i>
that Bucky had killed Tony's parents.
But if you do that early in the movie,
it's just gonna devastate
all the rest of your plot
and you're just gonna be beating
each other up about that.
McFEELY: <i>Well, you couldn't
do the third act we wanted to do...</i>
MARKUS: <i>Right, so...</i>
JOE: <i>'Cause the minute
he finds out about it...</i>
McFEELY: <i>That's the thing...</i>
MARKUS: <i>Getting Bucky
into the plot, but not in...</i>
-But holding off that Tony part...
-McFEELY: <i>Right.</i>
MARKUS: <i>...uh, was very important.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Well, think about
what you've seen so far.</i>
Steve says "no” to the Accords.
All right? Let's say, you know,
Bucky's story didn't come up.
-Now what is your movie?
-MARKUS: <i>Yeah.</i>
McFEELY: <i>It is just a political argument.</i>
Some third person would've
undoubtedly done something
and why would Steve get involved?
MARKUS: <i>Well, it's also,
can you with just a political argument</i>
come to blows without people going,
"Boy, what a bunch of hotheads..."
McFEELY: <i>Right. Steve
would have to be invested.</i>
There is no greater investment
than Bucky Barnes.
JOE: <i>This was I think, by far...</i>
For us it was,
and I don't know if it was for you...
This was by far and away the
hardest script we've ever worked on.
And I think it was because of the fact
that there was a precarious
balance in the film
between Cap and Tony,
making sure that
the audience was conflicted about
who was wrong and who was right.
Because we had to hide
the ball on Bucky.
Because we had to hide
the ball on Zemo.
Um, so, there are a lot of
complicated things that are...
E verything is predicated on everything
else in a very, very delicate way...
McFEELY: <i>Mmm-hmm.
JOE: Uh, um...</i>
That's much more complex
than a traditional structure.
MARKUS: <i>And constantly
having to, sort of, calibrate</i>
what we figured the audience
would understand at each point,
'cause we, of course, knew
much more about the plot
and it was a nicely working,
you know, piece of watchwork.
But, you know, the audience
doesn't see the gears moving,
so when this mysterious guy
who's about to appear
blows up UN headquarters...
McFEELY: <i>Are they lost,
are they invested...</i>
MARKUS: <i>It's a lot like, I...</i>
E very time I've watched the scene,
I know Bucky didn't do that.

McFEELY: <i>Tone donut, a tonut.
MARKUS: Wow.</i>
It's Okay, I can manage!
It's Okay, I can manage!

ANTHONY: <i>I love tone donuts.</i>
It's Okay, I can manage!
It's Okay, I can manage!
MARKUS: <i>Film students,
write that down.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Film students,
write that down.</i>
"Tone donut."
McFEELY: <i>Um, but do
you guys... May perhaps,</i>
you know, certainly in relationship to
Community and Arrested Development
-and things like that...
-JOE: <i>Sure.</i>
I mean, there's a, uh...
We knew that the movie
had the potential to be too dour.
It's about a very serious subject.
A lot of people die in the movie.
The key revelation in the film is about
a murder, of Tony's parents.
None of these are light subjects.
It's about regulation
based on collateral damage.
So, uh, we knew it would be
important to include
characters like Ant-Man
and Spider-Man,
who didn't have an emotional
connection to the main story,
because the minute
your lead characters
who are involved in
an A plot in a serious movie,
start making jokes,
you lose the stakes of the film
because the audience
no longer believes that they believe
-that the stakes are high.
-McFEELY: <i>Mmm-hmm.</i>
JOE: <i>So, we needed
characters who were</i>
not tied to the stakes of the movie.
Uh, and Ant-Man
and Spider-Man are not.
And it was important
to have one on each side
because we knew we were
gonna be collecting characters
and you wanted the tone to be able to
open up on each side and you'll see...
And I think that's why
people are so responsive to
Spider-Man and Ant-Man
in the airport battle.
McFEELY: <i>Right.</i>
JOE: <i>It's because they are
not tied to what's happening</i>
other than on a very
superficial level which is...
McFEELY: <i>Yeah. It is no accident
that they steal that scene.</i>
JOE: <i>Right. Yeah...
McFEELY: (CHUCKLES) Right?</i>
The people with the least investment
absolutely get to be funny.
JOE: <i>And they get the biggest,
funniest moments in it.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>And Joe and I
use a lot of references</i>
when we're preparing
a movie to direct.
Not just for ourselves,
but for other people.
It's a nice common language
for how we can chase certain ideas
of where are the places
we can go stylistically.
But one of the stranger ones
in this film, I think, is this scene
when we were talking with
our cinematographer, Trent Opaloch,
about how this apartment should look,
what it should feel like,
how it should be lit, et cetera.
He came up with this,
uh, video reference,
Turn Down for What by the Daniels...
A filmmaking team called the Daniels,
which is a really great video.
It has an awesome look to it
and that's very much the lighting
approach we took to this apartment.
Um...
But it's very... I mean, it couldn't...
The tone of the video couldn't be more
different than what's happening here.
But on a visual level,
it ended up working perfectly.
JOE: <i>The concept is that Bucky
is in hiding, obviously.</i>
He's in very temporary housing.
He knows how he can
escape from this building.
He's thought through it
a thousand times.
You know, he keeps
a go bag in the floorboards.
You know, he knows if they came
up the stairwell, he'd go this way,
if they came through the roof,
he could go that way.
There's a reason
there's newspaper on the window
so they can't see him inside.
And here, he knew
this time would probably come...
Which is why
when he takes the glove off
and he says, "It always ends in a fight, "
he's prepared for this, uh, emotionally.
JOE: <i>Shout-out to
Sebastian's performance</i>
in this scene,
which is just amazing.
It's like the way he can...
The way he can portray this character
who's, like, so fractured and damaged
and guarded, but, like, has something
still that's alive inside him is amazing.
MARKUS: <i>Yeah, well,
that was another challenge of</i>
tracking Bucky's consciousness
throughout this movie of...
'Cause he's about...
He's at least three different people
in this movie.
ANTHONY: <i>Right.</i>
MARKUS: <i>There's this Bucky
who is not fully aware of his past.</i>
But, you know, somewhere stranded
remembering what he's done...
Not quite remembering
who he originally was,
trying to put it all together.
JOE: <i>And who's fully powered.
MARKUS: Yeah.</i>
There's Terminator Bucky,
once Zemo basically turns him back
into the full Winter Soldier in Berlin.
And there is a more wide-open Bucky
once he wakes up
with his hand in the vice
because then, I think, he remembers
more than he remembers here.
JOE: <i>Another, um, great sequence
that Chad and Dave helped us with</i>
JOE: <i>Another, um, great sequence
that Chad and Dave helped us with</i>
Suspect has broken containment!
Suspect has broken containment!
Suspect has broken containment!
is the stairwell sequence
which we knew...
is the stairwell sequence
which we knew...
is the stairwell sequence
which we knew...
...he's headed down the east stairwell!
is the stairwell sequence
which we knew...
We went on a real scout in...
I think we found this
apartment building in Germany
<i>that we were gonna use
to double for Romania.</i>
<i>I think this was in Berlin.</i>
Is that right? Or did we...
No, in fact, it was Halle.
ANTHONY: <i>It was based in Halle. Yeah.
JOE: Yeah.</i>
So, we literally copied the stairwell
from an apartment building in Halle
and we built this on stage
because when Anthony
and I were walking in, we went,
"Wow! There could be an incredible
fight in a stairwell like this."
It's so compressed.
It was 12 stories up.
And I was like,
this is a real high-wire act.
If Bucky had to escape out his door,
how would he get out of his apartment?
And a lot of times, the way that
we come up with action sequences
is literally just by
sitting in a room and talking it through
on a very logical level.
Well, what would you do if...
You know, if you were a super soldier
on the run with a metal arm.
Um, he knows that
if he can get to the eighth floor,
he can make the jump
from one building to the next.
It's why he throws his
go bag out the window.
He knows exactly
where he's going to go.
Uh, I think he knows that
he needs to get to the tunnel.
That would get rid of helicopters.
I think he's thought through all of this.
So it's a very logical
escape plan for him,
what he didn't plan on
was Black Panther.
(McFEELY CHUCKLING)
ANTHONY: <i>We didn't actually build,
um, 12 floors of a stairwell.</i>
We built about four.
And, you know, through green screen,
up and down,
we make it look like
a much taller building on set.
McFEELY: <i>Yes, that's bullet resistant.</i>
MARKUS: <i>It's Vibranium weave,
I believe.</i>
-So, yes, that is the Black Panther.
-ANTHONY: <i>Yeah.</i>
MARKUS: <i>People have been waiting
for him, worried about how he'd look...</i>
I think he came out pretty well.
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah, came out pretty well.</i>
When I watched the movie
with my six-year-old son,
his two favorite characters were
Vision and the Black Panther, so...
JOE: <i>And real credit
goes to ILM here</i>
who really did a ton of work
on that outfit.
-I mean...
-McFEELY: <i>Right.</i>
JOE: <i>You know, we had an outfit
that we used on set that we just...</i>
It's impossible when you're talking
about an otherworldly outfit,
like the one that the Panther wears
which has a certain luminescence to it
because it's made of a woven metal.
We could never afford
to construct an outfit like that,
that an actor or stunt player
could move around in
without sweating to death
or, you know, that would capture
the luminescence that we need.
So, what he ended up doing in post
is ILM came in and painted over
Chadwick and the stuntman with...
The outfit is completely CG.
McFEELY: <i>This is every frame...</i>
JOE: <i>Every frame of Black Panther
is a CG outfit.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>But he did have
a costume on, much like that.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Which looked pretty good.
Yeah.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>That they ended up using
as a template, but they painted over.</i>
So, incredible work on their part.
But that's how you can realize
these characters.
You know, we try things on set
and then we know when we're not
getting what we need out of it,
then it goes to VFX.
And, you know, what we really demand
of our VFX department which is,
you know, both to their credit
and detrimental to people's awareness
of how good they are
is we want hardcore realism
out of the movie,
so you very rarely notice
the visual effects in the film...
MARKUS: <i>I might add,
that's not one of them.</i>
JOE: <i>That was not...</i>
That was... That's not...
MARKUS: <i>That's a real guy,
grabbing a real motorcycle...</i>
McFEELY: <i>Right.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>This sequence was shot
by a different</i>
second unit director,
Spiro Razatos,
who works with us.
He also shot the Nick Fwy car chase
in Winter Soldier. He's like...
McFEELY: <i>And is responsible for the
great things about Fast and Furious.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Exactly. He's the best
car guy in the world</i>
and we love working with him.
And he really helped
make this sequence special.
(JOE STAMMERING)
JOE: <i>Yeah,
real applause should go to Spiro</i>
for the work that he's done
both on Winter Soldier and this.
very, very dynamic,
very complicated sequences.
-Again, this was...
-McFEELY: <i>Right there.</i>
JOE: <i>...sitting in a room
thinking through,</i>
"Okay, (STUTTERS) if Bucky
got rid of Panther at that point,
"you know,
what's Panther's next option.
-"If Falcon is flying by, he uses Falcon."
-McFEELY: <i>Right.</i>
JOE: <i>If Bucky were to...
Bucky, what's the go bag for?</i>
Well, the go bag
is because he has bombs in it.
If Bucky were to blow up, um,
you know, part of the roof in order to
stop everybody from pursuing him,
then what would happen?
Well, Sam certainly
couldn't fly through it.
He would stop. That would send
Panther flying forward.
So, it's really like a very logical,
painstaking process
of really figuring out, um,
these action set pieces.
McFEELY: <i>What is the
smartest thing a person can do</i>
or characters can do
in these situations?
I mean, action reveals character
if you do it right.
JOE: <i>Right.</i>
McFEELY: <i>And you can't have a
sequence where one guy gets 17 wins</i>
-and one guy loses...
-JOE: <i>Exactly.</i>
McFEELY: <i>...seventeen times.</i>
So everyone has to have little turns
where they accomplish something
that ultimately,
you get where you need to go.
MARKUS: <i>Well, it's also,
when you're dealing with this many</i>
marquee characters...
You know, one of my complaints
about team-ups in comic books
is that everyone becomes
worse at their job
because they need to
share screen time.
It's like, how do you maintain their
power level and their skill set
and still have them not kill each other?
ANTHONY: <i>Well, you let
one of them cook.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Exactly.</i>
McFEELY: <i>That's right.
That's a skill set.</i>
JOE: <i>But I do think that you...</i>
And this is a movie that really deals
with that issue quite a bit,
because we have
a lot of characters in it,
and some of them
are extremely powerful
and could end the fight very quickly.
So, I think we tried to...
All of us collectively go at them
on a psychological level.
MARKUS: <i>Which explains this scene,</i>
'cause you have probably, physically,
the two most powerful people
in this movie,
and it's their burgeoning feelings
for each other
that cause them to hold back
a little bit in the airport fight,
which is why Vision doesn't just
squash everybody like a bug.
No one dislikes you, Wanda.
MARKUS: <i>And also why he
screws up and takes out Rhodey...</i>
JOE: <i>Because he's distracted.
MARKUS: Yeah.</i>
So it's all character.
JOE: <i>And Wanda made a mistake
at the beginning of the movie</i>
that is weighing very heavily on her.
ANTHONY: <i>Now that's why
that beat was...</i>
One of the reasons
why that beat was so important.
MARKUS: <i>And it's also
a tribute to both of these...</i>
There seems nothing unnatural about
flirting with this red-faced man
with a jewel in his head.
It just seems...
He's charming. He's cute.
JOE: <i>And his face is mesmerizing.
MARKUS: It is mesmerizing.</i>
McFEELY: <i>We got, as I remember,</i>
there were a few
test audiences who went,
"I don't want him to cook.
What's that about?"
(LAUGHTER)
-And so... But, I mean, jeez.
-ANTHONY: <i>That might be...</i>
It's interesting because Paul Bettany
wears an enormous amount
of makeup when we shoot.
He wears headgear.
It takes him a good
two and a half hours
to get into makeup,
and it's really cumbersome
and difficult, and he's a champ.
He never complains about it.
He always...
He's a very hard worker. He's amazing.
-But he doesn't look like this on set.
-McFEELY: <i>Mmm-hmm.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>He looks like, you know,
a much less exciting version of this.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Yeah.
A cosplay element, too.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>(CHUCKLES)
And I think those</i>
test audiences that
you're mentioning
are watching how he looked on set
'cause the visual effects
aren't done yet.
So, in the back of your head,
you always have to wonder, like,
is the fact that we're dealing with
incomplete visual effect treatment
compromising the experience
of a certain scene for the audience.
VISION: Not yours.
Mr. Stark would like to avoid the
possibility of another public incident.
Until the Accords are on
a more secure foundation.
And what do you want?
For people to see you...
ANTHONY: <i>He's trying to be human.</i>
JOE: <i>This is
a key relationship in the movie</i>
and it's gonna be
a key relationship moving toward.
(JOE STAMMERING)
On what level can
Vision and Wanda connect?
McFEELY: <i>Do you want to
talk about those big titles?</i>
JOE: <i>Yes, the big titles.</i>
We knew we needed
mile markers in the movie.
We wanted chapters in a way because
the movie moves from place to place.
McFEELY: <i>Goes a lot of places.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>And it can be
very confusing</i>
as to where you are
geographically.
But I also find, too,
that when you watch a film
and it's in small print
at the bottom of the screen,
you don't really register it.
And it's not like this an exercise
in idiot-proofing your titles.
Really, at the end of the day,
titles are just a...
They're a sorbet.
They're like a little palate cleanser
from what just happened.
Right, they're a mile marker
for the audience.
McFEELY: <i>Get ready for a new part.
MARKUS: Mmm-hmm.</i>
JOE: <i>So the fact that
we went with these big...</i>
Stylistically big, bold titles was really
just for you to reset your brain and go,
"Okay, I'm moving into
another chapter now."
And once you understand the language
after two or three titles comes up,
then you realize the movie progresses.
"Okay, this is now
a little bit of a reset,
"and we're now moving
into the next phase of the movie."
It's less important
where they are in the world.
What's more important is
you understand that this is a reset.
McFEELY: <i>Well, and this is...</i>
I mean, I learn something new
on every movie,
but I could not have predicted,
and I assume
you couldn't have either...
By virtue of doing that,
when you get to Queens,
your audience, if they're halfway
in the know, freaks out.
And that would not happen if it was
(TSKING) at the bottom of the screen.
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah, well, that's a good...</i>
I mean, look, the choice wasn't made
necessarily to set that moment,
but that's one of the happy things
you find as you're moving through.
I also think, because this movie
has a sense of fate to it
in the sense that you're moving toward
a very ominous, horrible reveal.
And all these characters are kind of
hurling toward that moment
unbeknownst to them...
The size of those title cards
sort of have...
I think they play to that
sense of fate and ominousness.
McFEELY: <i>Even if don't know
about a twist coming,</i>
you know that they're gonna fight.
You're expecting
a 15-minute sequence.
You might not know when it's coming,
but that inevitability
is all over the movie.
MARKUS: <i>Well, that's the challenge
and it takes time to get there, is...</i>
There are a lot of disparate scenes
that don't necessarily seem connected,
but you want the audience
to feel that there is
an intelligence behind it that is
showing you these things on purpose.
And trust us, they're all gonna
have to do with each other.
I'm not getting that shield back, am I?
JOE: <i>A shout-out
goes to Jeff Ford, our editor,</i>
who's been
an incredible partner to us...
Creative partner to us on both
Winter Soldier and this movie.
It was his idea
to go that big with the title.
McFEELY: <i>Oh, is that right?
JOE: Yes.</i>
And it was his instinct,
is that we needed that...
Just that reset moment.
ANTHONY: <i>Jeff Ford is one of
the most important people</i>
in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
He edited the first movie
that you guys did, the first Avenger.
MARKUS: <i>He's done
all the Cap movies.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Done all the Cap movies,
the Avengers movies...</i>
McFEELY: <i>And both Avengers movies.
ANTHONY: Yeah.</i>
I mean, he's an enormous
creative figure in the process.
And Joe and I are very, very grateful
to be able to work with him.
Felt timely.
FDR signed the Lend-Lease bill
with these in 1941.
McFEELY: <i>Uh, I kind of copped to the
idea that Robert brought the pens in.</i>
JOE: <i>Yes.
McFEELY: Yeah.</i>
-JOE: <i>That was actually...
-(LAUGHTER)</i>
So, our process with Robert...
We could talk about the process
with Robert a little bit.
Robert is a very, um...
I know the term is thrown around
too much, but he's an organic actor.
(JOE STAMMERING)
He likes the mercurial
part of the process,
inspirational part of the process.
And he really has to get
under the skin of a scene
in order to understand it
on an emotional level
for his interpretation of the character.
So, what all of us would do, is every
week before Robert would shoot...
And I think he was on the movie
for about eight weeks...
We would all go over
to his house on a Sunday,
have a very lovely lunch,
and then we would sit for a few hours
and talk through the scene with him
and Robert would do some
improvisation in character.
And, you know, the guys would
write some of the lines down
and then we'd talk through
the structure of the scene
and then, you know,
they'd restructure the scene.
Without compromising
the story in any way.
Which, really...
You know, Robert is incredibly additive,
um, certainly in terms of character
'cause he knows Tony Stark
better than anybody on the planet.
Um, and extremely inventive
in his choices.
And the pens were an idea
that he brought to the scene
as a way to represent what was going
on between Cap and Tony in the scene.
-And it adds for a very lovely...
-McFEELY: <i>Oh, it's great.</i>
They basically...
It gives you a beginning
and an end to that scene.
MARKUS: <i>And it reminds you about
this weird connection where that...</i>
Which this scene also does,
is that Steve knew
Ton y's father personally.
McFEELY: <i>Right. Well,
that's certainly by design.</i>
We knew we had to bring up Howard
just lightly a couple of times
in the movie.
It couldn't just rely on
the opening BARF scene.
-(CHUCKLES)
-JOE: <i>Right.</i>
McFEELY: <i>And Steve's
relationship to Howard</i>
was gonna echo
at the very end of the movie,
you know, when he drops his shield.
MARKUS: <i>Which reminds you
in the back of your head</i>
that Bucky probably knew Howard,
which is... Makes...
You know, there are layers
that we don't even talk about
that just get weirder.
ANTHONY: <i>I mean, look at...</i>
That's a very complicated backstory
that you guys figured out a way
to sort of bring into the narrative
in a very meaningful way.
I mean, the fact that you can use
Cap's relationship with Howard Stark
to fUither complicate the relationship
between Cap and Tony is awesome.
McFEELY: <i>We were doing Agent Carter.
It's a very small aside.</i>
But we wanted to make sure in the final
episode of Season 1 of Agent Carter
that Howard said something
to the effect of,
"Steve Rogers was
the greatest thing I ever did." Right?
So, just so that it would,
for anybody who's listening,
you know, it would pay off this idea that
maybe he would pursue super soldier
serum all the way into the '90s.
MARKUS: <i>But also when that guy
went on to raise a child...</i>
McFEELY: <i>(CHUCKLING)
Yes. It'd be a problem.</i>
MARKUS: <i>I've already decided
that someone else</i>
was the greatest thing
I've ever did.
McFEELY: <i>That's right.
ANTHONY: Yeah.</i>
JOE: <i>See, so, there is connection</i>
between the television'verse
and the movie universe.
MARKUS: <i>Mmm.</i>
JOE: <i>Uh, by the way, that is...</i>
I know I talked about the church being
one of my favorite acting scenes
in the movie.
That's my second favorite acting scene
in the movie.
And I'm not talking in any order,
but there's third one coming up
at the end of the film,
which is the, uh...
When Tony is watching the...
McFEELY: <i>What's in the box.
JOE: The "what's in the box" scene.</i>
"Bird costume"? Come on.
JOE: <i>So, maybe we could
talk about our process a little bit.</i>
'Cause now we've done
two movies together
and we're in process on two more.
From inception,
how we work on these films.
What's the first thing that we...
What we do.
MARKUS: <i>(EXHALES) We sit in a room.
It's also the last thing we do.</i>
-And we do it a lot in the middle.
-McFEELY: <i>(CHUCKLES) That's true.</i>
JOE: <i>There's a lot of talking involved.
McFEELY: Buoyed by some panic.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Not unlike this right now.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Exactly.
McFEELY: That's right.</i>
JOE: <i>A lot of note cards,
a lot of markers...</i>
McFEELY: <i>Yeah, we usually
end up in a conference room</i>
somewhere in the bowels of Marvel.
Uh, With. ..
Eventually it gets to
three-by-five cards up on a wall.
Sometimes it's a whiteboard.
And just trying to...
We'll talk blue sky, first, what...
In the case of Civil War, what threads
have we left on the ground,
um, after Winter Soldier.
Um, and then, once it got closer
to Civil War, as opposed to Cap 3,
well, what does that mean and what
plot points are, uh, inherent in that.
MARKUS: <i>(STUTTERS)
And that means more characters.</i>
Who do we actually...
Who can we actually have?
(McFEELY STAMMERING)
McFEELY: <i>This is just
speaking for Chris and myself.</i>
Plot points are huge for us as to,
how do we figure out
what the end of act two is?
What the midpoint is?
(McFEELY STAMMERING)
Unless we get those pretty early on,
we'll feel at sea.
Um, what's been helpful about working
with the Russo brothers is, uh,
character tends to trump all in a way,
I would say.
Uh, which I think, in Civil War,
makes it a rich...
A really rich experience.
You know, if characters aren't right
and clicking early,
-then they become chess pieces.
-ANTHONY: <i>Mmm-hmm.</i>
McFEELY: <i>And that is the danger
if you start with structure first.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Yeah.
McFEELY: For sure.</i>
JOE: <i>Then plot is driving the train
rather than character.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Yeah.
JOE: And look, the...</i>
Frankly, what Marvel is doing here is
creating a universe
filled with characters.
I think it's paramount
that's the primary motivation
for making these movies is
character-character interaction.
-What do the characters want?
-McFEELY: <i>That's right.</i>
JOE: <i>How are they different from
the last time we saw them.</i>
McFEELY: <i>People don't walk out
of a Marvel movie and go,</i>
"That was so well-structured."
-(McFEELY LAUGHING)
-JOE: <i>I loved that plot.</i>
MARKUS: <i>But it's also...
I mean, like, it is...</i>
We've certainly gotten to do more
character work writing these movies
and writing this many of these movies
than we would writing, you know,
one indie film about a guy
driving across country.
Which...
What people would think of
when you're like,
"Don't you wanna take a break
from the action
"and write character movies?"
Like, well...
Actually, wouldn't get
as much character in
as we've been able to do on this.
JOE: <i>Well, no,
and it's something...</i>
I mean, this is a bigger conversation
and it's something we talked about
when we were at the...
McFEELY: <i>Fortunately, the movie
is two and half hours,</i>
so we got time. (CHUCKLES)

the Smithsonian a week ago</i>

about the state of film and television.

-MARKUS: <i>Yeah.</i>
JOE: <i>Other than,
is the show creating...</i>
McFEELY: <i>Right.
Be part of the conversation.</i>
JOE: <i>Yeah.
McFEELY: That's right.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Is it part of the
cultural conversation or not.</i>
McFEELY: <i>True or false.</i>
Marvel is just
a very expensive TV show.
JOE: <i>Uh...
ANTHONY: False.</i>
JOE: <i>"False”?
Why would you say false?</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Well, it's not...</i>
It doesn't correlate directly to
a TV show in the sense that...
Again, you're getting...
I would say an episode, if you will,
of a Marvel movie
is more different from an episode...
TV episodes are
much more similar to one another.
There's a stronger sense of continuity,
of style and...
They're more distinct expressions.
McFEELY: <i>Episode 4 is not
wholly dissimilar from Episode 5,</i>
but in the case of the Marvel movies,
Ant-Man is vastly different
than Civil War.
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah, exactly.</i>
JOE: <i>Tonal exploration
and the reason why is,</i>
I mean, you could make
the comparison, I guess,
if there were four or five TV shows
that were being interwoven
into a unified narrative.
McFEELY: <i>Yeah. Right.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Not unlike
Laverne & Shirley and Happy Days.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Yes. OrI was thinking more...
ANTHONY: Let's not forget that.</i>
-JOE: <i>90210 and Melrose Place.
-MARKUS: The Avengers... I mean...</i>
You have your individual shows
and the Avengers
battle of the network stars.
(LAUGHTER)
McFEELY: <i>That's right.</i>
JOE: <i>But because you have
multiple, healthy franchises,</i>
which do have different tones,
being interwoven into
a unified narrative,
that's something else that was...
We were able to use,
I think, all of us to our advantage
in this movie,
is that we had a pre-existing tone.
As Ant-Man came out, we all went,
"Huh. That's a wholly different tone
"that we're gonna be able
to bring into this movie."
McFEELY: <i>Yeah.</i>
JOE: <i>And it was
especially helpful</i>
because we were trying to counteract
the heaviness of the material.
MARKUS: <i>And you don't wanna betray
the established characters.</i>
You don't wanna say,
"We're making a dark movie,
"so suddenly
you're going to see dark Ant-Man."
McFEELY: <i>Right.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Everybody has to stay true</i>
to the, you know, established
parameters of their character.
It's also why Spider-Man has to
come in and be a 15-year-old kid.
Not, you know, profound Spider-Man.
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah.</i>
(GRUNTING)
You could at least recognize me.
(GASPING)
(BOTH GRUNTING)
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)
ANTHONY: <i>And this is remarkably
similar</i>
to the conversation
we had with Anthony Mackie
-before we called action on this shot.
-(LAUGHTER)
McFEELY: <i>You're gonna
find a piece of clothing...</i>
JOE: <i>Yeah.</i>
MARKUS: <i>And you're not happy
about that clothing at all.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Did we exhaust that?
Did we explore that?</i>
JOE: <i>I think it was a longwinded
way to get to the point that...</i>
In the way that Tony Stark
and Steve Rogers have do-si-do'd,
I think, features and television
have do-si-do'd...
McFEELY: <i>Yeah. No, that's fair.</i>
JOE: <i>...quite a bit.</i>
But I also think, too,
that what's exciting about
being able to work specifically
in the Marvel Universe
is the fact that we do get
to focus on character,
because we don't have to...
You know, because the work is
being done in long-form storytelling...
ANTHONY: <i>Look at those
character arms...</i>
JOE: <i>Yes.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Or did that...</i>
JOE: <i>We were focusing
so hard on his character there.</i>
MARKUS: <i>This was filmed early on
and I remember Anthony saying, like,</i>
"You would not believe
what we just shot."
(ALL LAUGHING)
JOE: <i>His character is literally
bulging out of his biceps there.</i>
No, this is a perfect conversation
to have over that shot, by the way.
McFEELY: <i>Yeah.</i>
JOE: <i>But, you know,
I find that an advantage,</i>
and I find that satisfying
as a storyteller, uh,
to not have to worry about
more traditional structure.
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah.</i>
JOE: <i>To not have to build
everybody's backstory</i>
or, you know, catch the audience up
on every single character.
This is a very unique movie.
It doesn't exist
outside the Marvel Universe.
McFEELY: <i>No.</i>
I would love everyone
to enjoy it equally.
I assume that if you have missed
a few Marvel movies,
you will enjoy it slightly differently
than the person
who is all in and invested
and will gasp when
Howard and Maria Stark
are murdered at the end or...
JOE: <i>Well, serialized storytelling.</i>
So, if somebody came to me and I said,
"Hey, did you see Breaking Bad?"
And they said, "Yeah, I liked it.
Istarted on Season 3."
McFEELY: <i>Yeah, that's right.</i>
JOE: <i>You'd say, "You should've
watched Season 1 and 2.</i>
"You would've had
a better experience of that show."
McFEELY: <i>I mean, it's the difference
between Law & Order and The Wire.</i>
JOE: <i>Right.
MARKUS: Well, it's also...</i>
McFEELY: <i>I can just show up
for any Law & Order</i>
and probably know what's going on.
JOE: <i>Right.
McFEELY: And if I came in</i>
halfway through a season of The Wire,
I'm completely lost.

-MARKUS: <i>Yeah.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Your neighbor said,
"I read all the books.</i>
"This is the last book."
MARKUS: <i>They also
rented them as well.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Also more people
saw it in the theater.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah.</i>
JOE: <i>Meaning that, you know,
over the life of those movies,</i>
they were viewed many, many times
on DVD, and Apple TV and Kindle...
ANTHONY: <i>But I do think
it's like Steve said, too.</i>
I do think there...
You can watch this movie and enjoy it
coming in as fresh eyes.
It's possible.
You're never gonna
maybe enjoy it as much,
but you can definitely enjoy the film
without a history with the MCU.
MARKUS: <i>Lying on my couch
on a Saturday afternoon,</i>
which I don't get to do anymore,
but when I did,
you could come upon a movie
you knew nothing about.
Twenty minutes in...
ANTHONY: <i>Right.</i>
MARKUS: <i>storytelling
being storytelling,</i>
you go, "Okay, that's the hero,
that's the bad guy.
"You know, I understand enough
to now watch this movie..."
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah,
that's a good example.</i>
MARKUS: <i>"...and be entertained.”</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah.</i>
MARKUS: <i>It's a certain kind of movie.</i>
I don't know if you could come into,
you know, Schindler's List and go...
McFEELY: <i>You can tell the bad guys
in Schindler's List. (CHUCKLES)</i>
MARKUS: <i>Really? No.</i>
Now this scene is interesting
'cause it also appeared in Ant-Man.
ANTHONY: <i>Right. A portion of it.</i>
MARKUS: <i>In that, we...</i>
It was written and shot for this movie,
but then when Kevin saw it,
it occurred to him that it would make
a nice little tag for Ant-Man
and didn't give anything away for ours.
JOE: <i>Other than that there was
going to be an industrial vice...</i>
ANTHONY: <i>There's a
phrase in movie making...</i>
-"The camera loves his face."
-MARKUS: <i>Mmm.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>That shot
of Sebastian is always...</i>
With that angle, rakey shot.
JOE: <i>Well, again,
this is Sebastian playing</i>
yet another version
of the character in this movie.
Slightly more emotionally available,
slightly, you know, different than
the guy who was in the apaitment.
McFEELY: <i>Right.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Do we see...</i>
JOE: <i>And different than the guy
that's on this motorcycle.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Every time that we
wrecked that Cadillac it...</i>
-There's a part of me that died.
-(McFEELY LAUGHING)
MARKUS: <i>On a rural road in Georgia.
McFEELY: In Georgia. Yeah.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>We actually
only wrecked that Cadillac once.</i>
We shot it from several angles.
McFEELY: <i>Do we see any more in this
flashback than we did at the beginning?</i>
-Or is it, uh...
-ANTHONY: <i>Yeah, we... 'Cause...</i>
Well, we go into this sequence.
MARKUS: <i>Oh, yeah.
You're right. Right, right, right.</i>
McFEELY: <i>This is Heidi Moneymaker.
JOE: Yep, that's Heidi.</i>
A cameo by a lot of our stunt doubles.
ANTHONY: <i>Heidi is
Scarlet's stunt double.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Real life superheroes.
JOE: That's Jackson.</i>
-That is, um...
-ANTHONY: <i>He doubles Cap a lot.</i>
JOE: <i>Doubles Cap.</i>
Uh, Heidi doubles Natasha/Scarlet.
Uh, Heidi doubles Natasha/Scarlet.
It hurts!
Uh, Heidi doubles Natasha/Scarlet.
-Aaron Toney is coming up...
-ANTHONY: <i>Doubles Falcon.</i>
JOE: <i>Doubles Falcon.</i>
This is Karpov
who was previously in the movie
drowned in his sink
in the basement of his house.
McFEELY: <i>That's right.
Don't get attached to Karpov.</i>
JOE: <i>But again, this was...</i>
The intention...
The way we directed this sequence
was to try to bring a level of
visceral horror to it.
It's almost like a horror movie.
Because we wanted
the audience to believe
that these characters
were powerful enough
to give our heroes a run for their money
in a third act fight.
McFEELY: <i>Now, this is one
big, fat misdirect, all right.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Now, this is one
big, fat misdirect, all right.</i>
Good work.
McFEELY: <i>Now, this is one
big, fat misdirect, all right.</i>
You need to know about these people
because they're the third act.
JOE: <i>And you
needed to feel their violence</i>
and the threat of them
in this sequence,
so that you would be tricked
in your own brain that,
so that you would be tricked
in your own brain that,
Get me out Of here.
so that you would be tricked
in your own brain that,
"Oh, this is obviously
where the movie is heading,
"is a showdown
between these characters."
Especially 'cause one of them
beats Bucky up in the sequence.
MARKUS: <i>Yeah.</i>
JOE: <i>So, then your mind is going,</i>
"Oh, wow. Hmm. Yeah, they're even
stronger than the Winter Soldier."
But none of it has anything
to do with the film.
The twist obviously is that they're all
dead when the heroes get there.
JOE: <i>Which is what we're looking for
on an emotional level is to confuse you.</i>
So that when the reveal happens
with Tony Stark,
you're more off-balance.
Not dissimilar to the way
that Tony Stark feels.
McFEELY: <i>Right.</i>
I mean, and again, put yourself in
all of our positions, right?
We're saying that the third acts
of the Marvel movies
have been similar and have caused
a certain sort of collateral damage.
This third act
will not be the same thing.
So, if you think this is gonna be
another punch-'em-up,
we would be hypocritical
if we gave you that.
So, in that sense,
you should've seen this comin'.
JOE: <i>That's right.
ANTHONY: Right.</i>
Which is, you know,
like all good tragedies.
MARKUS: <i>That's right.</i>
JOE: <i>So, this, uh...</i>
The scene is, you know, to touch
base again with the government,
that they're slowly squeezing Tony.
They're pressuring him
to bring in the otherAvengers,
which forces him to make a decision
because he and Natasha,
as they say in the scene,
-are feeling particularly outgunned.
-ANTHONY: <i>Yeah.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>They're ratcheting toward...</i>
McFEELY: <i>Toward the airport. Yeah.
ANTHONY: Toward the airport.</i>
McFEELY: <i>So that Tony has a...</i>
Tony is the best alternative
that Steve has.
And so, Ross is a bit of the villain
for this section, yeah.
ANTHONY: <i>There's a lot of hard work.</i>
This is... It was making it very organic
that our guys needed to go out
and recruit new people.
McFEELY: <i>Mmm-hmm.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Ross gives them
such a difficult task here.</i>
To go clash with those two guys.
MARKUS: <i>And I will say,
you guys and Jeff...</i>
This scene went all the way through
to Tony saying the word "Queens."
McFEELY: <i>(CHUCKLING) That's right.</i>
MARKUS: <i>And now,
there's this amazing cut</i>
to seeing the word "Queens”
and it's a thousand times better.
McFEELY: <i>Yep.
ANTHONY: Yeah.</i>
Well, you wait a whole career
for a out like that.
McFEELY: <i>(CHUCKLING)
It is really good.</i>
Where'd you get the song, by the way?
'Cause every cut was always
that song. I forgot the...
JOE: <i>It's a song I've been
listening to a lot and Joe brought it up</i>
-and it just worked so perfectly.
-McFEELY: <i>Yeah.</i>
JOE: <i>I was playing it on set.</i>
I like to have music in my head
for the movie
-'cause it helps me with tone.
-McFEELY: <i>Mmm-hmm.</i>
JOE: <i>So, I was playing it
on set just</i>
for the energy...
To understand the energy
that we wanted from...
McFEELY: <i>The appearance
of Peter. Yeah.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Peter Parker.</i>
We wanted a currency to him.
An immediacy.
We wanted him to feel current.
McFEELY: <i>Mmm-hmm.
JOE: Um...</i>
And, uh, you know...
ANTHONY: <i>Have a different...
JOE: And I've got a...</i>
Have a completely different energy.
I've got a 19-year-old daughter...
MARKUS: <i>I just want to say,
that girl down the hall is a star!</i>
JOE: <i>Exactly.</i>
JOE: <i>I've got a 19-year-old kid</i>
who actually was sitting
down the hall there on the phone.
But I wanted this character
to be of the moment.
He was one of my favorite characters
growing up.
The energy that we wanted to project
was of a real kid,
living in Queens
on a single parent income,
who is a bit of a tech genius.
What would it be like when, you know,
a star, a celebrity like Tony Stark
shows up in your house...
ANTHONY: <i>Well, not just a celebrity,
but a guy who's a veritable hero to you,</i>
in the sense that you are very much
out from the same cloth as him.
But he's in a completely rarified
stratosphere from where you are.
JOE: <i>But it's the way both
he and May react to him</i>
that makes this scene funny.
Is that they are living
this normal existence.
Or she believes they're living
this normal existence in Queens,
in this small apartment and
a billionaire shows up on her couch.
MARKUS: <i>And it's also
nice to have an Aunt May</i>
who's age-appropriate to an aunt,
-not a grandmother.
-McFEELY: <i>Right.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah. That's a good point.</i>
MARKUS: <i>It just, again,
makes it feel more</i>
like something you might actually
encounter in real life.
McFEELY: <i>Right.
Not ripped from a comic.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah.</i>
As walnut date loaves go,
that wasn't bad.
Whoa, what have we here?
Retro tech, huh?
Thrift store? Salvation Army?
-Uh, the garbage, actually.
-You're a dumpster diver?
MARKUS: <i>What I love
about this scene is,</i>
you know, Tom has been in movies,
but not that many.
He's 18, 19 when this was shot.
So, the nerves of Tom Holland being
in a room with Robert Downey Jr.
are 50% of the scene,
and the rest of it is acting like
you're nervous Peter Parker
being with, uh, Tony Stark.
So, it's just jazzed up
by the fact that...
McFEELY: <i>The dynamic is
the same in life.</i>
MARKUS: <i>This kid is in the room
with this huge actor.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>(STAMMERING)
Also, this scene is</i>
so interesting, too,
because it is. ..
We used a version... You guys wrote
a version of this scene...
MARKUS: <i>Yeah.
ANTHONY: ...to audition the actor.</i>
And we did screen tests
with several actors
with Robert Downey Jr. of this scene.
A different version of it.
But the thing is,
we got to really work
the hell out of this scene,
both with the actors and you guys
in terms of what the structure
of the scene would be.
And I think, this scene
is one of my favorite in the film.
But it's interesting that
it was a product of a lot of...
We had several runs at the scene,
so to speak,
before we actually had to commit to it.
MARKUS: <i>A...
JOE: Sorry. go ahead.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Yeah.
No, I was just saying I love...</i>
Speaking of set design,
how crappy in the best possible way
this room looks.
This looks like a kid's
with not a lot of money's room.
Queens...
ANTHONY: <i>As we were
trying to sort of just dirty it up</i>
and junk it up and make it feel real...
What's real to us
(STUTTERS) on a texture level,
I remember at one point,
Kevin saying to Joe and I,
"Guys..." You know, they're like,
-"Don't go too crazy." And I was like...
-(ALL LAUGHING)
And I was like, "I get it, Kevin.
Aunt May is not a junkie, okay?"
MARKUS: <i>They don't even have
a working toilet, Kevin.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Oh, my God.</i>
JOE: <i>But we refused to
put posters on the wall,</i>
which seemed too cliched.
McFEELY: <i>Right.</i>
JOE: <i>You know, that's what
a kid's room is like.</i>
There are some...
That's what I was like
when I was younger.
It was temp hangers
and crap everywhere.
You know, if you move into a room
that doesn't have a closet,
they're not gonna spend the money
to build a closet.
They, you know, get a handyman over
and he puts up some, uh...
McFEELY: <i>That's a great point.
What's to say that...</i>
Why do we think
they've been here 15 years?
-If there's no reason to...
-JOE: <i>Well, look, it could...</i>
He refers to Uncle Ben's death here
in a speech in the most subtle way.
How long ago did he die?
Were they in a house?
Did they have to give the house up
because of the mortgage?
Are they now in this apartment?
You know, he's got milk crates
to keep his junk on.
He collects crap.
He's a dumpster diver.
You know, so,
this is not... (STAMMERS)
And he's like any 16-year-old kid,
he's not organized.
-His bed isn't made. He...
-McFEELY: <i>Yeah.</i>
JOE: <i>Uh...</i>
So, I think it...
E verything in there
is about his personality
and hopefully giving a window
into who he is.
ANTHONY: <i>Well, also,
fora young actor, it's like...</i>
One of the things I was always
struck by in this scene is,
to be able to act
with Robert Downey Jr.
when he's giving...
Like, Downey gave this scene his all.
He knew how important
this scene was.
He knew how important
Tom's performance in this scene
would be, as well as his own.
And he gave this scene so much
and he helped...
You know, it's like, you're
never gonna be a better actor
than when you're acting
across from Robert Downey Jr.
-It's an amazing thing.
-McFEELY: <i>You better be on your toes.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>He does something here,
this line right here about the leg.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Yeah.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>So, Tom, you know,
forgot the blacking of the scene.</i>
And of course, (CHUCKLES)
that's Robert staying in character,
telling him you're supposed
to move now, so I can sit on the bed.
McFEELY: <i>(CHUCKLING) Fabulous.
ANTHONY: But he's...</i>
Not only does he use it,
but he uses it in a way
that's really enteitaining and fun.
JOE: <i>And becomes one of
the better moments in this.</i>
McFEELY: <i>He really is great.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>With him
totally in character.</i>
I mean, that's such a dexterous
and inventive move on an actor's part.
JOE: <i>I will say that...</i>
ANTHONY: <i>You don't
see that very often.</i>
JOE: <i>To pick up what you were
talking about, Anth, this...</i>
There's been many, many,
many a moment where I went,
"That's why Robert Downey
is Robert Downey."
But no moment more so
than when we blacked this scene
with him and with Tom Holland.
You know, we knew
how important the scene was.
And we showed up
to start blacking the scene.
And, you know, we knew we had about
an hour and a half, two hours to do it
because we were gonna take the time
to get it right.
It was a very small space,
so there's not a lot
you can do in this scene.
But if you notice,
they move quite a bit in the scene.
And after about 15 minutes of blacking,
I saw Downey and I...
And this was where I went,
"This guy is an absolute genius.
"He really understands movement
and spatial relationship to camera."
He started moving around the space
and Anth and I just kinda stepped back,
and we watched
as he encouraged Tom's blacking
throughout the whole sequence and...
And, you know, making suggestions.
"What would... If you went over
to the bed at this point."
Or, "What if you..."
And the whole scene developed
between he and Tom.
Uh, and it is...
We've seen the movie with a lot
of audiences now, at the premieres.
It's always regarded as one
of the favorite scenes in the film.
McFEELY: <i>It is charming.</i>
JOE: <i>Uh, and it's really...</i>
A lot of credit goes to Robert
for helping Tom craft a star-making
performance in the scene.
I've caused enough problems.
MARKUS: <i>This is Hawkeye's
first appearance in the movie.</i>
Again, being brought in when the...
-When the plot demands rather than...
-McFEELY: <i>That's right.</i>
MARKUS: <i>...wanting to remind you</i>
that he's got a home life
or anything like that.
McFEELY: <i>But that said,</i>
even his first line reminds you
he has a home life.
MARKUS: <i>Yeah.</i>
I knew I should've stretched.
VISION: Clint, you can't overpower me.
I know I can't.
JOE: <i>He knows he's in trouble here.</i>
You know, his intent
was to ambush Vision
and get out of there
as quickly as possible.
And I'm sure he had
in the back of his head...
He's banking on his
emotional connection
to, uh, Scarlet Witch through their...
The debt that he owes to her brother,
that she would help him if he needed it.
I mean, she really,
she dismantles Vision in this scene.
And I think she's being gentle with him.
MARKUS: <i>But I will say, something
that's probably lost on most people</i>
is that she's not forcing him
through the floor...
McFEELY: <i>No, she's just...</i>
MARKUS: <i>She has
made him unbelievably heavy.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Right.</i>
Come on. We got one more stop.
ATTACHE: It's just a matter of time.
Our satellites are
running facial, biometric...
JOE: <i>One of the best moments
in the movie,</i>
which is the showdown between
Natasha and T'Challa's bodyguard...
McFEELY: <i>It's one of the few
light moments for T'Challa.</i>
MARKUS: <i>As entertaining
as that would be...</i>
JOE: <i>It is, but I...</i>
Somebody actually, I think, wrote
an article saying how they thought
that that was
the best moment in the movie.
MARKUS: <i>Really?
JOE: Was...</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Some people were...</i>
McFEELY:
Just 'cause it's a showdown...
Just 'cause it's
powerful women sort of facing off?
JOE: <i>Facing off. And implying
what's to come and that the...</i>
That that is, um...
-And the world of Wakanda.
-McFEELY: <i>Yeah.</i>
JOE: <i>T'Challa's got a deep team.</i>
McFEELY: <i>He does.</i>
Good, because this stuff
tends to draw a crowd.
ANTHONY: <i>Oh, yeah,
"Can you move your seat up?"</i>
McFEELY: <i>"Can you move
your seat up?"</i>
JOE: <i>Yeah. That's the value
of the Marvel Universe.</i>
-That's character interaction.
-McFEELY: <i>Right.</i>
JOE: <i>And I think
that, like Vision cooking,</i>
when you see these powerful
characters in very human situations,
it can be very funny.
McFEELY: You have
to let these things breathe.
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah, as...</i>
McFEELY: <i>You have to let
people be people.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Here we have
Steve's second kiss</i>
in the entire span of his career
as Captain America.
McFEELY: <i>This is not to say...
JOE: On-screen kiss. Yeah.</i>
MARKUS: <i>No. Yeah, on-screen,
on-screen.</i>
I'm sure he's been up to no good.
-That was...
-Late.
Damn right.
-I should go.
-Okay.
McFEELY: <i>I ruined a take by walking
in the background there once.</i>
MARKUS: <i>very nice.
McFEELY: Yeah.</i>
MARKUS: <i>We'll say this is Chris Evans
actually operating that vehicle.</i>
-JOE: <i>I was a little nervous.
-(OTHERS CHUCKLING)</i>
Was driving a little fast.
Cap.
MARKUS: <i>And now,
we're coming to our</i>
"next appearing as the plot
demands it" appearance...
JOE: <i>Yeah. Mr...
McFEELY: Yeah.</i>
JOE: <i>Mr. Paul Rudd.</i>
McFEELY: <i>And we certainly
tried versions</i>
where someone
went to San Francisco
and interrupted a soccer game
and that kind of stuff.
MARKUS: <i>Sure.</i>
JOE: <i>Just didn't feel necessary.
McFEELY: Didn't feel necessary.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Yeah. Particularly
as Ant-Man came out last year.</i>
It's the most recent origin story
of any of these people.
If anything's gonna be
in the public consciousness, it's him.
JOE: <i>So, Paul Rudd
is a wonderful performer and he's...</i>
He's very inventive.
He's up for trying things all the time.
Joe and I have worked with that type
of actor quite a bit in our comedy years.
And, anyway, he...
The amount of good material
we had for this scene was crazy.
In this meeting with Captain America.
JOE: <i>And I think we readjusted
his intro on the day,</i>
just based on the way that Paul
was reacting to being on set.
McFEELY: <i>Well... Assume...</i>
You can assume that Paul Rudd,
his entire dialog
is half-scripted and half Rudd.
MARKUS: <i>(CHUCKLES) Right.
JOE: He... But it was really...</i>
What was cute was
that morning on set, he said,
"Wow! I feel like a kid in a candy store.
I can't actually believe I'm here.
"I know I was making a Marvel movie,
but I was all by myself
"and now here I am and there's Chris
Evans who plays Captain America
"and, um, Sebastian Stan
who plays the Winter Soldier
"and I... Jeremy Renner."
And so, that energy made its way
into his introduction in the scene.
And it started to inform
his arc as a character.
MARKUS: <i>And here begins the...
McFEELY: Right.</i>
MARKUS: <i>The ice cream sundae,
the reason you make this movie.</i>
JOE: <i>(CHUCKLING) That's right.</i>
This sequence took so much work,
it was unbelievable.
McFEELY: <i>Yeah, do you want
to start the list of shout-outs</i>
of people who we owe
this scene to? (CHUCKLING)
JOE: <i>Yes. A lot of people.</i>
I mean, first and foremost
is our VFX team.
We can never give enough praise
to that team.
You know, what's weird
is that we garnered
a reputation after Winter Soldier
that we like to do things
as practically as possible.
McFEELY: (CHUCKLING) That's right.
JOE: <i>However, there
still were 2, 600 or 2, 700</i>
visual effects shots in that movie.
Um, and the same applies for this film.
They're just so good at their job
that they hide a lot of the work
that they do.
Ninety percent of this scene
was shot on green screen in Atlanta.
So, most of the backgrounds
you're looking at were put in later.
They're real backgrounds.
ANTHONY: <i>None of that is there
that you're seeing right now.</i>
McFEELY: <i>They're based
on the Leipzig Airport, but...</i>
ANTHONY: <i>They are. So, some are...
MARKUS: OrI should say...</i>
JOE: <i>Some are real backgrounds,
others are wholly created,</i>
like the parking garage
behind Spider-Man doesn't exist.
ANTHONY: <i>So, many of the vehicles
that you're seeing are...</i>
We did have on our backlot at Atlanta.
So, the vehicles are real.
Mostly. But everything
beyond the vehicles.
MARKUS: <i>And I will say,
when you say backlot in Atlanta,</i>
you're neglecting to say
100 degree backlot.
JOE: <i>Yes, backlot.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>I've suppressed
the memOry.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Where these guys
in rubber costumes...</i>
McFEELY: <i>That's the heat stroke.</i>
MARKUS: <i>...out in the direct sunlight
in 100 degrees, is astonishing.</i>
JOE: <i>Well, we took the
temperature of the blacktop</i>
one of the days we were out there
and it was 120.
So, standing there
in these rubber boots,
and with your feet burning
on the blacktop...
And this is...
These scenes take hours to shoot.
So, you know,
when we're doing Chris's dialog,
he may be standing on that spot
for two hours,
uh, baking in 110-degree heat
in a suit that doesn't breathe.
ANTHONY: <i>And the same for the actors
and the stunt people.</i>
I mean, they're fighting, so, it's like,
the level of physical exertion
that's going on
combined with the heat is staggering.
And again, you're wrapped up in a suit.
JOE: <i>Uh, to talk about Spider-Man's
outfit for a little bit, I do...</i>
I think there were...
I don't know, we probably...
We looked at quite a number of outfits.
But ultimately I think that the thinking
was that he should be
the iconic version of the...
He should feel different
from the other movies,
but be the iconic
version of Spider-Man.
So, that when he shows up on-screen,
your heart goes...
McFEELY: <i>That's what I was waiting for.
This is Ryan Meinerding.</i>
JOE: <i>"That's Spider-Man."
Yep. Ryan Meinerding...</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Right. Designed...
JOE: ...designed that outfit.</i>
An amazing job. He designs a lot.
He and his team designed every outfit.
Or a lot of the outfits.
JOE: <i>Many of the outfits.</i>
And then, Judianna,
our costume designer,
designs many as well.
And she also figures out how to
build all these outfits, which is...
There's usually...
There's a huge evolution that...
You can design something
on paper in a picture.
But to figure out
how do you make a version of that
that actually moves, is functional,
looks good in reality,
it's a completely different process
you have to go through, so...
JOE: <i>We had experimented with
much more radical Spider-Man outfits,</i>
but ultimately decided against it
for that reason.
-Um, another shout-out goes to ILM.
-McFEELY: <i>Right.</i>
JOE: <i>Who did all of the
visual effects work on this sequence</i>
and they're geniuses.
I mean, this was not...
This is as complicated as a scene gets
in respect to CG.
ANTHONY: <i>And I will say this,
look, we all...</i>
The four of us here
have a great working relationship.
And one of the things that has always
struck me about the process,
both on the Winter Soldier
and this movie is,
if you look at the final version
of the draft that we went...
The script that we went
into production with,
it's remarkably similar
to the final cut of the movie, right?
MARKUS: <i>Yeah.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>In both movies.
But the big...</i>
I would say this scene is probably the
biggest exception from that dynamic
in the sense that this scene
was so hard.
And much of this scene was made
throughout the post process.
Like Joe was saying earlier,
and you guys were writing newlines,
new dialog
several times throughout
the post process
as we continued to evolve and shape,
shape this sequence.
It was really the kind
of thing that was... It took the entire...
From the time you guys started with...
From the time
we were all developing the story
until the time the movie was locked.
This sequence was basically
being made that entire period.
MARKUS: <i>And you essentially shot it
throughout the entire shoot, too.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Right.
We keep coming back to it.</i>
MARKUS: <i>In little chunks, little bits.
JOE: That's right.</i>
The other great thing is because
a lot of the characters are CG,
you can alter takes,
performance, dialog, shots.
MARKUS: <i>And thank God
for helmets and masks.</i>
JOE: <i>Yeah.
McFEELY: That's right.</i>
MARKUS: <i>They can say anything.
ANTHONY: Oh, yeah.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>That's right.</i>
JOE: <i>I think we rewrote
a lot of Panther's dialog.</i>
-As well as a lot of Scott Lang's dialog.
-MARKUS: <i>Mmm-hmm.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Some of the best jokes
are late in the process.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>And Peter Parker's.
Yeah. Yes.</i>
(SCREAMING)
You couldn't have done that earlier?
I hate you.
Great.
Hey, Cap, heads-up!
Throw it at this.
Now!
Oh, come on!
Oh, man, I thought it was a water truck.
Uh, sorry.
All right, now I'm pissed.
Is this part of the plan?
Well, my plan was go easy on them.
You wanna switch it up?
There's our ride.
Come on!
Captain Rogers...
I know you believe
what you're doing is right.
But for the collective good...
you must surrender now.
(SPIDER-MAN GRUNTS)
ANTHONY: <i>One of the reasons
why I love this sequence so much</i>
is not only...
Okay, on a surface level
you've got two objectives in this scene.
Cap's team needs to get out of there
and get to Siberia
to stop the super soldiers.
Tony's side needs to stop...
Capture Cap's side
and bring 'em in so Ross doesn't send
something worse after them.
I mean, very clear.
But every single character in this scene
has an individual story that's unfolding,
that sometimes dovetails
with those overarching objectives
that they're involved with,
and sometimes runs against it,
counter to it.
And it's like,
I think that was one of the most
fun things about working with all of us.
Crafting this sequence.
It was figuring out how do we make
the most of those individual stories
that each character has,
as the movie...
McFEELY: <i>Yeah. I will say that's
good advice for, uh, future storytellers.</i>
Is that, you know, this could
easily have been just a mess.
-Right?
-JOE: <i>And for a while it was.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Well, and the desire
to have cool stuff happen.</i>
But unless you keep reminding people,
we have to get there.
We need to stop them
without murdering them.
You'll just be...
You'll just get this
muddy, mucky mess of CGI.
MARKUS: <i>And you can't...
JOE: Yeah.</i>
MARKUS: <i>You can't have people
behave out of character</i>
just because it leads
to an exciting sequence.
If they wouldn't commit that act,
they can't commit that act.
JOE: <i>Well, that I think
throws an audience</i>
<i>out of a movie
faster than anything.</i>
<i>When a character...</i>
<i>Well, when a character
makes a choice out of character</i>
<i>in order to get to a joke...</i>
McFEELY: <i>Right.</i>
JOE: <i>Or a bit that...</i>
McFEELY: <i>Right.</i>
JOE: <i>...that the director or writers
wanted in the film.</i>
McFEELY: <i>You need to be willing
to cut your favorite stuff.</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>
-ANTHONY: <i>But that...</i>
<i>Look, at the end of the day,</i>
<i>we had these really good things
to hang our hats on in this sequence.</i>
<i>You know, it's like Black Panther
just wants to kill the Winter Soldier.</i>
<i>Spider-Man just wants
to impress Mr. Stark.</i>
<i>The Vision is melting down
over the complication...</i>
<i>His deteriorating relationship
with Scarlet Witch.</i>
<i>There are these very specific things
that we were able to use</i>
<i>to turn the action and anchor the action
in this sequence and it's...</i>
MARKUS: <i>And I will say,
it wouldn't work at all</i>
<i>if there wasn't more plot to come.</i>
<i>-If this was the third act battle...</i>
-JOE: <i>Right.</i>
MARKUS: <i>...that would mean that
no one had anywhere to go after this.</i>
<i>And the only way it would end</i>
<i>is if somebody just beat somebody
into unconsciousness. So...</i>
<i>Having Steve's team
need to get somewhere else,</i>
<i>to have a plot that's powering them
past this moment,</i>
<i>uh, justifies its existence.</i>
'Cause otherwise,
it would just feel like,
"Hey we have all the toys. We're
gonna throw 'em all on the floor."
McFEELY: <i>I mean, this is
a little insider baseball,</i>
but this is essentially
the end of act two.
And usually the end of act two is,
"What's the worst thing that could
possibly happen to your heroes?"
And it is, in that Rhodey is crippled
and the Avengers are de facto
broken up at this moment.
But it's also an exciting 15 minutes
of everything
every comic book fan wants to see.
In part, we could do that
because we knew we were going dark
at the end of the movie.
I mean, it's different if you're
gonna have a happy ending.
Dark moment is the end of act two.
We were all trying to figure out
whether or not,
how dark do you go
at the end of act two
when your movie's
gonna go a little dark.
ANTHONY: <i>Well, also,
in this sequence...</i>
You know, one reason I think we could
all have so much fun with it
was these people don't want...
This is not a life or death fight.
They don't want to kill each other.
They wanna win,
they wanna defeat each other,
-but nobody wants to kill each other.
-McFEELY: <i>Right.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>So, it changes
the tonal, the tenor of the fight.</i>
Well, there are a couple...
You know, with the exception
of Panther wanting to kill Bucky.
But, with that exception
everyone can...
MARKUS: <i>And also, as they
punch each other, they get angrier.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Right. This should grow.</i>
MARKUS: <i>People are willing to
do things near the end of the fight</i>
that they wouldn't have done
at the beginning of it.
JOE: <i>Now, no pun intended,
this was a big moment in the, um...</i>
In the development process,
was the inclusion of Giant-Man...
McFEELY: Yeah.
JOE: <i>...in the movie.</i>
Now, admittedly, anybody would
look at this and see the...
(STUTTERS) And you could
easily make
the argument that
it was over-stuffed.
McFEELY: <i>Sure.</i>
JOE: <i>So, you know,
if someone were to say to you,</i>
maybe we should not have
as many characters in this sequence,
it's not an illogical argument.
However, we felt, I think, that we
had a handle on every character
and we knew that we needed
progression of storytelling.
That each character
was motivated in the sequence.
That we could potentially get away
with having this many characters
in the sequence.
And we knew we needed...
And if you look at...
We talk about a three act structure.
If you look at this sequence,
it has a three act structure.
McFEELY: <i>It does.
MARKUS: Mmm-hmm.</i>
JOE: <i>And, you know, this is
the third act of the sequence.</i>
(STAMMERING) Or, yeah, I don't know,
would you call it the midpoint?
McFEELY: <i>Oh, would this be
the midpoint? Ba-ba-ba-ba.</i>
JOE: <i>It could be 'cause it changes
the direction of the sequence.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Well, it sort of feels
like the midpoint is the...</i>
McFEELY: <i>Oh, I guess,
maybe end of act two.</i>
MARKUS: <i>...is when they
were running at each other...</i>
JOE: <i>End of act two.
McFEELY: It might be. Right.</i>
But is the end of act two
Natasha letting 'em go?
JOE: <i>Could be. (STAMMERING)</i>
McFEELY: <i>'Cause it's not...
I don't think it's...</i>
The end is Vision, you know,
knocking...
JOE: <i>Zapping War Machine
out of the sky, but...</i>
ANTHONY: <i>That was...
JOE: In either case...</i>
ANTHONY: <i>That, by the way,
was very much</i>
a typical day in the life
of the four of us.
-That conversation right there.
-JOE: <i>In either case...</i>
McFEELY: <i>We're halfway to something
smart, but not really. (CHUCKLING)</i>
JOE: <i>We knew we needed something
big to happen in order for team...</i>
Again, I just keep
throwing big out there.
But we needed something
that would turn the events
of the storytelling, in a way
Tony's team would be shocked.
It was a big revelation.
It was a big distraction that would allow
those two to get in that Quinjet.
We had discussed other things.
I think, one other...
'Cause we were asked to take...
McFEELY: <i>There was,
yeah, I mean...</i>
JOE: <i>...Giant-Man off the table
at one point.</i>
And I think Wanda
had blown up all the...
McFEELY: <i>I think she lit a fuel line
at one point.</i>
JOE: <i>Yeah, and blew up half the airport.</i>
McFEELY: Yeah, it wasn't that...
JOE: <i>And we thought,</i>
well, as far as collateral damage
goes, that's really not...
JOE: <i>It's, you know...
McFEELY: Yeah, it's hypocritical.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>We just...
Here's the thing. We did try hard.</i>
We tried hard
to come up with another idea.
What could turn the fight?
That was our need.
How do you turn the fight to allow for,
oh, you know, Cap's escape?
MARKUS: <i>And how
do you escalate</i>
when your fight started with 12
superheroes running at each other.
You're starting at a 10.
Where are you gonna go?
McFEELY: Right.
MARKUS: <i>And it's also, without it...</i>
We talk about giving
every character,
no matter how small, an arc.
Without it...
McFEELY: <i>Scott doesn't have
much of a...</i>
MARKUS: <i>...Scott Lang wouldn't have
any character movement.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Oh, my gosh, he might be
my favorite arc in this whole sequence.</i>
The fact that he shows up,
who's the rookie,
who's just star-struck to be called up
to the team unexpectedly.
And he's the guy
who comes in for the big win,
is just hilarious, you know?
McFEELY: <i>And allows them
to get away. Yes.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah.</i>
MARKUS: <i>With a skill
no one even knew he had.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>It was so perfect
for his character.</i>
JOE: <i>So, I think there's real value,</i>
and we do get challenged a lot,
which is good.
And I think it's a healthy part
of the creative process,
because you have
to think long and hard
-about why you do need what you need.
-McFEELY: <i>Mmm-hmm.</i>
JOE: <i>And it allows you to make better
and stronger decisions.</i>
And I do think that
because it was a process
of getting Giant-Man in the movie,
that we really made sure he was
substantiated when he did appear.
McFEELY: <i>No, I mean, I... If you go...</i>
You go to the store
and you have a budget,
you're gonna buy
the things that you need.
If you have a...
You win a shopping spree
you're gonna run through there
in two minutes
and have 17 frozen turkeys. Right?
JOE: <i>Yeah, and then
how do you get it home?</i>
McFEELY: <i>(CHUCKLES) Exactly.</i>
JOE: <i>And some, uh, Skinny Cows.</i>
McFEELY: <i>(LAUGHS) That's right.</i>
JOE: <i>A couple of boxes. Uh...</i>
WAR MACHINE:
Jesus, Tony, how old is this guy?
McFEELY: <i>And I will cop to,</i>
we didn't think this should be in there.
We were wrong.
(LAUGHS)
ANTHONY: <i>Well, again, it's like the
same process Joe was talking about.</i>
You just go, these are all...
Part of the fun of these movies
is the process you go through
of vetting each beat
and banging it up and...
JOE: <i>Well, we...</i>
Do you remember
how this came down...
So, Anth and I had got on a plane,
had to come back to...
We were in Atlanta at that time
prepping the movie.
Came back to Los Angeles
to convince everybody why we needed
Giant-Man in the film
'cause he wasn't cheap either
'cause we knew he'd be
very expensive in visual effects.
Uh, and then when we landed,
we were like, "Okay, we've got him.
"How do we get him out of the fight?"
That was the key.
And so, we were talking through,
as we always do,
a logical progression of ways that they,
Tony's team, could do in Giant-Man.
Uh, and one of which was,
"Well, what do we do with Spider-Man?
He's so good in this sequence.
"Can the kid bring down..."
And again...
So, it's like rookie on rookie...
Uh, "Can the kid
bring down Giant-Man?"
We said, "All right, well,
what could he do to him?
"Well, he could certainly swing
around his legs and tie him up.
-"Just like the..."
-ANTHONY: <i>AT-AT style.</i>
JOE: <i>"...the AT-AT in
The Empire Strikes Back."</i>
And then we went,
"Well, why don't we just own that."
McFEELY: Right.
JOE: <i>"Why don't we have
the kid reference it?"</i>
McFEELY: <i>Right.
And make everyone feel ancient.</i>
JOE: <i>Yes.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>But I remember I heard
one criticism of this beat</i>
where someone was like,
"Oh, come on, uh, how could he...
"With that really old movie
and the ice planet,
"he wouldn't know all of this stuff."
McFEELY: <i>(SCOFFS)
That's an old man talking.</i>
-(McFEELY LAUGHS)
-ANTHONY: <i>"HOW would he know..."</i>
That is such an old man
because in truth,
in truth, Tom Holland has never seen
The Empire Strikes Back.
McFEELY: <i>Why would he?
It was in 1980.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah. Exactly. So...</i>
MARKUS: <i>Oddly enough, he's seen
Kramer vs. Kramer 12 times.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Kramer vs. Kramer.</i>
-McFEELY: <i>That's right.
-(LAUGHTER)</i>
JOE: <i>So, here's where the Vision...</i>
His head has been this entire fight as,
you know, his focus is on Wanda.
Uh, which really allows us to...
Again, it's a character beat.
McFEELY: <i>Yeah. No, that's the thing.
It's always...</i>
We always knew that, uh...
You wanted this to end.
You didn't want necessarily...
Friendly fire was always the way
we wanted to go. Right?
Because then you couldn't directly
hold someone accountable
in the same way as it
Steve had broken Tony...
Uh, Rhodey's legs.
JOE: <i>Yeah. And he didn't know
that, uh, Falcon was there.</i>
McFEELY: <i>That's the thing.
So, there's a little...</i>
We play a little bit here, right?
So, Steve is not looking
in his rearview mirror.
Does not know
that Rhodey has been hurt in this way.
JOE: <i>Yeah, he's only thinking</i>
that, uh, Falcon has probably
assisted in his escape.
McFEELY: Yeah.
Even in the previs,
people would gasp and just sort of
get emotional when this happened.
When it just looked like a video game.
JOE: <i>There was a reconstruction we did</i>
very late in the editorial process
that was. . .
This is where Kevin,
who's probably one of the most
value-add producers
in the history of the business,
was sitting in with us in the edit room
and he just said,
"I think there's another way
we can get more impact out of that."
And we literally, I think,
changed the construction
of two shots at the end there.
And, uh, you know,
people gasped in the next
-test screening that we did.
-ANTHONY: <i>It was better.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Just going to the wide
or something? Or...</i>
JOE: <i>No, it was, um...
I think it was the...</i>
ANTHONY: <i>It was changing
the shot sequence.</i>
McFEELY: <i>So, stuff you already had,
but just in a different order.</i>
JOE: <i>Yeah, and it was definitely...</i>
JOE: <i>Yeah, and it was definitely...</i>
- this is room 201
- this is room 201
- this is room 201
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah, I think it was
when he said "Rhodes."</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah, I think it was
when he said "Rhodes."</i>
We changed the part
where he screams, "Rhodes."
We changed the part
where he screams, "Rhodes."
Bacon and black coffee again today?
Bacon and black coffee again today?
Bacon and black coffee again today?
JOE: <i>Oh, yeah, we did.
We changed where he said, "Rhodes."</i>
JOE: <i>Oh, yeah, we did.
We changed where he said, "Rhodes."</i>
Um, but also, I think, that last shot...
Um, but also, I think, that last shot...
You know me so well...
Um, but also, I think, that last shot...
Because you're not anticipating,
Hello? Your breakfast is here.
Hello? Your breakfast is here.
because there's been so many shots
in a row of him falling through frame...
because there's been so many shots
in a row of him falling through frame...
because there's been so many shots
in a row of him falling through frame...
May I let myself in?
May I let myself in?
May I let myself in?
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah, where you lose
how close he's getting to the ground.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah, where you lose
how close he's getting to the ground.</i>
So, it becomes more of a surprise
when he hits all of a sudden.
JOE: <i>So, that last shot...</i>
He's still in the sky,
and you don't reveal the ground
till literally he hits.
McFEELY: Gotcha.
JOE: <i>Which is when it creates
a surprise for the audience.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Ah, I see the trick.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Now, there's
an extraordinary actor in this scene.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Yeah, can we talk about how
all our cameos were cut?</i>
MARKUS: <i>Well, let's talk about
Gozie Agbo for a second.</i>
JOE: <i>By the way, that is not me.
ANTHONY: Yeah.</i>
JOE: <i>That is an on-set P.A.,</i>
so that I could stand at the monitor
and shoot the shot.
ANTHONY: <i>Sure.</i>
Even though Joe
does play that character, he's...
Yeah, that is not him in that shot.
JOE: <i>That was, uh, an homage to
the Coen brothers.</i>
McFEELY: Right.
JOE: <i>very Blood Simple-esque shot.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Which might, again...
(STUTTERS)</i>
Part of the problem
with the Marvel Universe,
some movies are more kid-friendly
than others
because part of the fun of the films
is that there's a tonal range
in terms of what the movies are.
Some play to a more mature set,
and some play to...
Ant-Man, I think, is more accessible to
a younger audience, you know?
So, it's complicated and, um...
So, it's hard to...
People always ask,
"Well, how old does my kid have to be
to watch the movie?"
It's such a hard question
to answer but...
For some reason, my six-year-old
didn't want to watch the movie.
I was telling these guys the other day.
And he...
The only thing he was disturbed by
in the whole movie
was that shot
of the body in the bathtub,
the Coen brothers shot.
MARKUS: <i>Well, it's also his uncle.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Did he know
it was Uncle Joe?</i>
-(McFEELY LAUGHS)
-ANTHONY: <i>No, he couldn't even...</i>
He didn't put it together
that that was Joe
in that tub in the shot there
because you don't see it.
McFEELY: <i>Sure,
of course, you don't really...</i>
ANTHONY: <i>So, he...
I couldn't tell him that</i>
'cause didn't want him to associate...
He was so disturbed by it.
He demanded to know...
-He was like, "Why did you do that?"
-MARKUS: <i>Wow!</i>
ANTHONY: <i>And then he was like,
"Who's idea was that?"</i>
McFEELY: <i>Aw. (LAUGHS)
ANTHONY: He was...</i>
MARKUS: <i>Zemo's.</i>
-ANTHONY: <i>Yeah, yes.
-(LAUGHTER)</i>
JOE: <i>Uh, this was something that
I remember we all reworked on the day.</i>
McFEELY: <i>There was
a little scramble on the day.</i>
JOE: <i>But it came out very well</i>
and it's really just going
at the essence of the relationship
between these two characters
who have known each other
for many movies now.
McFEELY: <i>And I think it's good
that someone calls, uh, Tony Stark out.</i>
JOE: <i>Mmm. Absolutely.
McFEELY: Right to his face.</i>
MARKUS: <i>But he also calls her
on her double agent thing...</i>
McFEELY: <i>Yes. That's true.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Which is valid in that</i>
A, that was how he first met her
in Iron Man 2.
But also, she did just switch sides.
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah.
MARKUS: Emotionally. You know?</i>
MARKUS: <i>What's the deal?</i>
ANTHONY: <i>I love it. It's like
a very shrewd game of chess here,</i>
where both people
get hurt emotionally.
McFEELY: <i>Oh, and I'm just noticing, uh,
we're at the up angle.</i>
JOE: <i>Well, what's interesting is,</i>
we've been asked a question
a couple of times
from people about
why Tony would recruit
a 16-year-old kid
or 15-year-old kid to go fight with him.
And, you know, I say, "Look at..."
"The thing that is interesting
to the four of us on a creative level
"is examining
what the word 'hero' means."
And these are very human characters.
And they are very flawed, and Tony,
perhaps the most flawed of all of them.
McFEELY: <i>Sure.</i>
JOE: <i>Uh, because of
his constant battle</i>
between his moral center
and his narcissism.
And I think there is a side of Tony
that did not want to lose that fight.
Um, there's a very valid reason in that
the kid is a walking non-lethal weapon,
uh, who is as strong as anybody
in the Marvel canon.
Uh, he's not as strong as the Hulk
or Thor, but he's up there.
Uh, so, he's not bringing a defenseless
individual into the fight.
He's actually bringing a ringer.
Uh, who can web everybody up.
McFEELY: <i>Well, that's thing.
His weapon of choice is...</i>
The web doesn't go
through your sternum.
JOE: <i>It's like, Vision is not very handy
in a fight like that.</i>
Because if Vision were to laser you,
as is evidenced
by what happens in the sequence,
he could kill you if it goes wrong.
Uh, and his strength is so significant
that he could hurt you. Um...
So, there's a very
conscious choice on his part
to insert himself very strategically,
uh, in that fight.
Uh, but I think it's interesting to note
that Tony's narcissism does get
the better of him quite often.
And I think that's what makes him
such an interesting
and unpredictable character.
McFEELY: Right.
JOE: <i>Uh, Daniel BrL'ihI is amazing
in this part as Zemo.</i>
-very restrained, um, and very likeable.
-MARKUS: <i>Mmm-hmm.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Right, he's getting a lot of
"best Marvel villains ever.”</i>
JOE: <i>Yeah. very empathetic portrayal
of a character.</i>
I actually like Zemo quite a bit
in the movie. Had he not, um...
ANTHONY: <i>Been a psychopath and...</i>
McFEELY: <i>Murdered several hundred
people in Vienna.</i>
JOE: <i>Been a psychopath
that bombed the UN.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>He just slips up a little.</i>
JOE: <i>He does play the character.</i>
He does not play him like a sociopath.
He plays him like an everyman.
Uh, which makes it very unsettling.
And when he finally gives his speech
at the end, um, very sad.
McFEELY: Right.
ANTHONY: <i>And that speech,
of course, is. ..</i>
The setting is the Siberian Tundra,
but we shot that, of course,
in Atlanta in the middle of the summer.
MARKUS: <i>very early on.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Maybe day one
for Chadwick or early on...</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah, it was day one
for Chadwick.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Yeah, yeah.</i>
-It was a really hard scene to start with.
-McFEELY: <i>For sure.</i>
JOE: <i>Yeah, by the way,
that's great to note that the...</i>
I think, Chadwick's best scene
in the movie
was his first day on set.
ANTHONY: <i>It's amazing. Yeah.</i>
But, he also...
<i>Part of Brühl's brilliance</i>
is that he can play freezing
in 90-degree weather.
McFEELY: <i>That's right. (CHUCKLES)
MARKUS: Mmm-hmm.</i>
JOE: <i>With, uh, what were they?
What were the snowflakes made of?</i>
ANTHONY: <i>I don't even remember.</i>
JOE: <i>They were...
Are they potato flakes or...</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah, maybe, I don't know.
MARKUS: Something like that, yeah.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>But also, again, kudos
to our visual effects team</i>
because that looks beautiful
and brilliant and not...
McFEELY: <i>And the location department</i>
for finding
this underground helicopter pad.
-(McFEELY LAUGHS)
-JOE: <i>Right.</i>
JOE: <i>What's fascinating about that,
is that we could, again,</i>
spend a lot of money
to fly everybody to Iceland,
drive two hours outside of Reykjavik,
uh, stay in a basecamp
at the bottom of a mountain,
go up the mountain
which would take two hours,
uh, shoot for two hours,
have the cameras freeze up
on us four times,
uh, have two people get frostbite,
go back down the mountain,
um, and gotten that scene even though
that you could see the actors
shivering during their takes.
Or could've executed it
the way that we executed it,
uh, and relied on our
amazing visual effects team
to pull us through, and they did.
ANTHONY: <i>And our amazing actors.
JOE: Yes.</i>
McFEELY: <i>More people
calling Tony out for his behavior.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>I love this. This is...
I love this beat with, um, Hawkeye.</i>
McFEELY: <i>La, la, la.</i>
JOE: <i>Uh, it is all...
By the way, all deserved.</i>
Which is, part of, again,
as I was saying earlier,
what's so fun about his character
is his flaws.
But if you were in a relationship
with Tony Stark,
or he was a friend
or a co-worker of yours,
it would certainly be something
that would irritate you.
McFEELY: <i>Yes, I mean,</i>
Tony should not be let off the hook
time and time again, you know?
ANTHONY: <i>Oh, yeah.</i>
JOE: <i>And this to me,</i>
this is my favorite Hawkeye scene
in all of the movies, is this scene.
McFEELY: Yeah, 'cause
he's right and wrong.
JOE: <i>Yeah.</i>
McFEELY: <i>You know? He did put
his family at risk</i>
by coming to the aid of Wanda.
JOE: <i>Well, there is a recklessness
to Clint that is interesting.</i>
There is somebody...
A soldier of fortune like him,
there is an adrenaline rush
that he is addicted to as a character.
McFEELY: <i>That's fair.
JOE: Uh...</i>
And I think that, uh,
he does pay for that.
JOE: <i>He did disappoint his kids.
ANTHONY: He did.</i>
McFEELY: <i>They are not
going waterskiing.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Now, had a lot of questions
about this next line from Sam.</i>
JOE: <i>Yeah.
ANTHONY: Which one?</i>
JOE: <i>The Mark Fuhrman?
McFEELY: The Mark Fuhrman one.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Did you really
get questions about it?</i>
JOE: <i>Was that an... I can't...
Was that an improv?</i>
McFEELY: No.
ANTHONY: <i>No, it was on a...
We had a list of responses...</i>
JOE: <i>Oh, that's right.
McFEELY: Yeah.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>He had...
There was a couple alts there.</i>
McFEELY: <i>The one they...
I mean, you know, our worry with...</i>
ANTHONY: <i>And that was the one
that Mackie loved, yeah.</i>
McFEELY: <i>I believe so. Yeah.
ANTHONY: Yeah.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Uh, I think
it's a dated reference, generally.</i>
And so that was the worry.
Um, but because
People v. OJ. Simpson
has just aired, um,
within the last few months,
somehow now it was a much more
timely reference.
And so, particularly in places like D. C.,
the entire crowd went..."Wow!”
(JOE AND MARKUS CHUCKLE)
ANTHONY: <i>This beat here is again,
one of my favorite from Mackie.</i>
It might be my favorite moment
of his in the whole movie.
McFEELY: <i>The awkward decision
to trust Tony?</i>
JOE: <i>He knows what...
I mean, he heard the story, you know?</i>
He saw what we saw,
which is this extremely violent group
of super soldiers
who are certainly more powerful than
Cap and Winter Soldier individually,
as one of them beat up
the Winter Soldier. Um...
The two of them are headed
up there, they think,
to take on this team on their own.
So, Sam is acutely aware
that they are headed
for potential massacre.
McFEELY: Oh, right.
There were supposed to be five
of them going up there, right?
MARKUS: <i>And now they're down to two.
So, Sam knows Steve's in trouble.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>That's what's so cool
about the beat is, again,</i>
it makes Sam a hero.
It's like he's in a prison cell, but yet,
he still figures out a way to help Cap.
Even in the very narrow, uh,
options that he has.
JOE: <i>As part of our misdirect,
we told Henry Jackman, we go,</i>
"We want you to make this the most
blatantly commercial, heroic
-"piece of score in the movie."
-McFEELY: <i>Oh. (LAUGHS)</i>
McFEELY: <i>Great. Great.</i>
JOE: <i>Because the idea,
you should believe,</i>
is that you are watching
the traditional structure of these films.
Tony is now putting on the suit...
ANTHONY: <i>The strength of
the Avengers is gonna prevail.</i>
JOE: <i>Yes. Yes.</i>
Again, your brain is convinced,
um, on a storytelling level,
that you're in for a super soldier fight.
MARKUS: <i>Mmm-hmm.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>And you know, Steve...</i>
JOE: <i>That's a little
Romanoff Easter egg there.</i>
McFEELY: <i>That's right.
She's got a lot of guns.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Talking about this idea of...</i>
You brought up earlier with fresh eyes
and people watching the movie
for the first time.
And this is an interesting example
of why we kept a beat
like this in the movie is,
just so some people
who don't know
the history of the characters
understand that these guys have a...
Grew up together, have a friendship
with one another that's deep. And...
MARKUS: <i>And are 100 years old.
McFEELY: And 100 years old.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Exactly. Are 100 years old.
McFEELY: We don't stress that a lot.</i>
JOE: <i>Well, it's also important
to remind the audience</i>
before they go into
what they're about to go into,
which is not a fight
against super soldiers,
but a fight with Tony Stark,
why Cap would defend Bucky...
McFEELY: <i>Yes. When you get to that.</i>
JOE: <i>...in those circumstances.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Because they shared a ride
in a refrigerator truck.</i>
McFEELY: <i>That's right.
MARKUS: Mmm-hmm.</i>
JOE: <i>By the way, speaking of
Easter eggs, I forgot to mention</i>
that people should
keep their eyes open
if you're an Arrested Development fan.
In the...
ANTHONY: <i>So,
that is the Bluth stair car?</i>
JOE: <i>That is the Bluth stair car.</i>
-(MARKUS CHUCKLES)
-ANTHONY: <i>But it's painted.</i>
JOE: <i>It's the same colors
as the Bluth stair car.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Okay. Was it, uh...
Is it VFX or is it there?</i>
ANTHONY: <i>It was actually made
by the art department.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Okay, [didn't even notice.</i>
JOE: <i>Yes. We drove around
and put it in the back of shots.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>'Cause we would have
people visit set sometimes</i>
and they would drive by some
of the vehicles and be like,
"Is that the Bluth stair car?"
McFEELY: <i>I really should
watch that show.</i>
(LAUGHTER)
McFEELY: <i>Uh, this I remember.
That was...</i>
Uh, that staging was very important
to Joe and Anth. Of...
ANTHONY: <i>The way
he comes out there or...</i>
McFEELY: <i>Well, no, the Winter
Soldier behind the shield, right?</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Oh, yeah.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Sort of this is how
we would have done it in 1944.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>It was great. Exactly.
McFEELY: Pretty cool.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Like Joe was saying earlier,
just to play to their...</i>
The friendship and the connection
these two guys have,
and to see them operate as a unit.
McFEELY: <i>There's muscle memOry.
This is...</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah, exactly.</i>
That sounds like a lot of paperwork.
(SCOFFS)
It's good to see you, Tony.
You too, Cap.
JOE: <i>That was a Robert.
Or was that you guys?</i>
McFEELY: <i>Manchurian Candidate's
a Robert.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Yeah.
MARKUS: Mmm-hmm.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Poor Bucky's confused.</i>
MARKUS: <i>"I didn't see that..."</i>
JOE: <i>He doesn't get the reference.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Right.
ANTHONY: Yeah.</i>
JOE: <i>So, this was a big conversation
that we had</i>
about how to work T'Challa
into the third act,
because we knew
that his arc wasn't complete.
Um, and what was the storytelling
going into the third act with him.
And, how could we include him
in something that was so personal
between Cap, Bucky and Tony.
JOE: <i>And he ultimately ends up</i>
making the most heroic choice
of anybody in the movie,
uh, which is to forego murdering Zemo.
McFEELY: <i>Well,
that's the thing is that it's...</i>
We were given the leeway to,
and had the confidence to not have
either Steve or Tony
confront the bad guy
in any physical way.
That it was okay for, one, nobody to
beat him up. Right? (CHUCKLES)
Uh, and for his just deserts
to simply be surviving.
That's the thing he didn't want.
MARKUS: <i>But what's nice is</i>
the guy who does get to confront him
is the guy whose father he murdered.
McFEELY: <i>Who's most wronged him,
yeah.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Which is awesome. Yeah.</i>
But that's...
As far as thickening the storytelling
is there's a lot of people
who have it out
for the Avengers in this movie.
From Alfre Woodard
when she confronts Tony,
to Zemo, to Ross, to T'Challa.
McFEELY: The American media. Right.
ANTHONY: <i>T'Challa. Exactly.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>I mean, there's...</i>
And the unifying theme
among all those people
is revenge and vengeance.
It's like everybody
is trying to correct a wrong
that they've endured.
MARKUS: <i>Within five minutes,</i>
we were talking about
the death of Tony's father,
the death of Zemo's father,
and the death of T'Challa's father.
-We just waste a lot of fathers.
-(LAUGHTE R)
JOE: <i>This is, uh...</i>
We've referred to the movie several
times as a psychological thriller,
and this is really
where it becomes evident
why we refer to it that way.
When they walk in and you see
the super soldiers are murdered,
um, it is unsettling.
And, you know,
the key moments in this movie
turn on the psychology
of the characters,
the choices that they make.
Winter Soldier is a political thriller.
You know, it's turning on plot
until Steve catches up to the plot
at the end of act two.
Uh, this movie is turning
on their psychology.
Uh, and, um...
And certainly it's a thriller
because you don't know...
You have no idea what the villain
is up to in this movie
until this moment.
MARKUS: <i>Yeah. And it's all...</i>
His entire plan was
to press play on a videotape.
-Which is kinda fantastic.
-McFEELY: <i>Now, that said...</i>
You know, I do see it's one of the few...
Uh, few criticisms of the movie is
that somehow it's very convenient
that Tony showed up here, at the time,
so he could see this tape.
MARKUS: <i>But then I think he...
McFEELY: I posture... (LAUGHS)</i>
MARKUS: <i>He would've played it
elsewhere.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Well, that's the thing.
He had the tape.</i>
So, he would've sent it to him
or he would've come...
At some point he was gonna tell him
that Steve Rogers lied to him
and that his best friend
killed his parents.
JOE: <i>Had Tony not showed up,
he could've...</i>
McFEELY: Yeah. This is...
JOE: <i>Snuck out the back door
and disappeared with the tape</i>
<i>and he would've found a new day
to execute his plan, but...</i>
<i>-Yes, everything...</i>
-MARKUS: <i>He's a patient man.</i>
JOE: <i>He is on a suicide mission, Zemo.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Thankfully movies
are judged on their high points.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Well, that's the thing.</i>
<i>We shrink time all the time
in order to get what we want.</i>
JOE: <i>But, you know,
Zemo is on a suicide mission.</i>
<i>He is committed to,
uh, ending his life, uh,</i>
<i>in order to service the goal that he has.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>This is the kind of scene
where, as directors,</i>
<i>you have to be very sensitive
with actors,</i>
<i>'cause what Downey was doing
in this performance</i>
<i>while he was watching the tape</i>
<i>is so complicated.
It's sensitive and raw.</i>
<i>You have to be very, uh,
specific about your shots.</i>
<i>You know, you can't ask an actor to
shred themselves emotionally like that.</i>
McFEELY: <i>So, literally, you planned
on only doing this a few times?</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Exactly. 'Cause you know,</i>
<i>you can't dial something up
like that over and over.</i>
JOE: <i>And he wasn't watching anything.</i>
<i>We hadn't shot this yet. I was literally
standing off camera with the script</i>
<i>just reading what he was saying.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Well, yes, and I remember
you gilding the lily at times. You know...</i>
JOE: <i>Yes. I was trying to...</i>
McFEELY: <i>And now they're pleading!</i>
JOE: <i>Yes.</i>
McFEELY: <i>They're screaming!</i>
JOE: <i>She's begging for her life!</i>
McFEELY: <i>Exactly.</i> (LAUGHS)
JOE: <i>I did try to
goose him emotionally, yes.</i>
McFEELY: <i>There's something...</i>
McFEELY: <i>No. It worked great.</i>
JOE: <i>Yeah.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Something very brutal
about the fact</i>
<i>that Bucky strangled the mom
with his human hand, you know?</i>
JOE: <i>We were very intentionally
graphic with that sequence.</i>
<i>Obviously, because we wanted
the audience</i>
<i>to feel what Tony was feeling
when he saw the tape.</i>
<i>And to realize that this character
whom a lot of people love,</i>
<i>the Winter Soldier, uh, has a very,
very dark and bloody history.</i>
<i>Uh, and, you know,
who will pay for those crimes.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Right. Whether he's a victim
or not, and I would submit that he is,</i>
<i>but he's also the one who did it.</i>
<i>And so, I cannot blame Tony
for snapping here.</i>
<i>And it would take a very strong man
to listen to the argument,</i>
<i>"But he didn't do...
He wasn't in his right mind."</i>
<i>That's tough to swallow right now.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>This beat,
"Did you know, " was also...</i>
McFEELY: <i>Well, this is a...</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Controversial moment
in the movie.</i>
McFEELY: <i>I'm so glad
it landed the way it did.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah.</i>
McFEELY: <i>But, uh, you know,
I wasn't sure</i>
<i>everyone was gonna go for it.</i>
(LAUGHS)
JOE: <i>It was a long process
and a long fight</i>
<i>to just include the fact in the movie</i>
<i>that the one time that Steve Rogers...</i>
<i>He doesn't lie,
but he withholds the truth...</i>
<i>Willingly withholds the truth,</i>
<i>is because his gut told him
that this would be the end result.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Right. It is the most
complicated thing</i>
<i>he's done in five movies...</i>
ANTHONY: <i>And the most flawed...
Yeah, I think,</i>
<i>arguably, the most flawed thing in that</i>
<i>'cause you can... You know,</i>
<i>Tony interprets it as a betrayal
of their relationship.</i>
JOE: <i>Betrayal of trust, which he should.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>And it certainly is.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>You know?
It certainly is and that's...</i>
<i>It's so great to take this guy</i>
<i>and find such
a human, vulnerable moment</i>
<i>out of Steve Rogers, you know?</i>
McFEELY: <i>Right.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Well, it was also Steve's...</i>
<i>You know, he does have a willful blind
spot about Bucky, you know?</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah, it's true.</i>
MARKUS: <i>It's like, I don't want to look at
the fact that he probably did this.</i>
JOE: <i>Well,
as everyone does about family.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Yeah.</i>
JOE: <i>You know, it's that they...</i>
<i>There are emotional bonds
that you have</i>
<i>that supersede logic.</i>
<i>Now this is, the...
We sit around the room and talk about,</i>
<i>"Well, how could the Winter Soldier
and Cap take on...</i>
<i>"Iron Man."</i>
<i>Well, you know,
the one thing about Cap</i>
<i>is he is by far and away the
most tactical of all of the characters.</i>
<i>So, you see before
Tony even got away from him,</i>
<i>the first thing he made sure to do
was to disable Tony's boot,</i>
<i>uh, which would destabilize his ability...</i>
McFEELY: <i>It's the only way
this silo sequence works.</i>
<i>And again,
you're using the setting, right?</i>
<i>It's an old, uh, Russian military...</i>
<i>Soviet military base that's been
taken over by HYDRA.</i>
<i>So, then you have this big silo.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah.</i>
JOE: <i>You know,
Tony is a mechanized hero.</i>
<i>Uh, so, you can degrade his equipment</i>
<i>and at the same time
degrade his ability.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>But he can still go analog
when he needs to.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Right. You know,
he's gonna use the Force on that one.</i>
(LAUGHTER)
(BUCKY GRUNTS)
JOE: <i>I mean, he really
wants to murder Bucky</i>
<i>with his own hands in this scene.</i>
<i>And that's really the thought process
we were following.</i>
<i>Why he kept trying to get
close to Bucky. Was he really...</i>
<i>He wanted to hear him</i>
<i>admit that he did it,
and he wanted to see him suffer.</i>
<i>Make him suffer. Yeah.</i>
McFEELY: <i>That's the thing, you know,</i>
<i>the goal was stakes without,</i>
<i>you know, millions
and millions of people being at risk.</i>
<i>People you've invested in are at risk.</i>
<i>And the hope is that it works</i>
<i>because you've had
12 movies of investment.</i>
MARKUS: <i>I mean,
there are so many layers to it</i>
<i>because he also wants to hurt Bucky
to hurt Steve at this point.</i>
<i>-Because, you know...</i>
-McFEELY: <i>Steve's failed him.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Yeah.
You love this thing so much,</i>
<i>I'm gonna take it away from you.</i>
JOE: <i>This is a... I mean, this is</i>
<i>about as brutal a sequence
as there is in the movie. Um...</i>
<i>And it is. It's very complicated</i>
<i>because if I'm a fan of Cap and Bucky,
then it's a rousing moment for me.</i>
<i>-This moment...</i>
-McFEELY: <i>Right.</i>
JOE: <i>And if I'm a fan of Iron Man,
then it's horrifying.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Winter Soldier's gonna
save them both.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Right.</i>
McFEELY: <i>The music gets operatic.
It's great.</i>
JOE: <i>A nice Russian influence
in the music.</i>
<i>It's like a Prokofiev, um...</i>
<i>Quality to it, tone to it.</i>
McFEELY: <i>This is straight
out of the comics, right?</i>
JOE: <i>Yeah. That's a...</i>
<i>You know, part of what we do
when we all sit in a room together</i>
<i>is we pull key pieces of art
and have them printed up,</i>
<i>and blow 'em up
and stick them on the wall,</i>
<i>you know, just as archetypes
or archetypal moments</i>
<i>or, you know, big story moments
that we want to drive at.</i>
<i>And that was on the wall
since day one.</i>
<i>That great piece of art from the books.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Brühl's very witty and
the woman in... The voice of his...</i>
<i>That he keeps listening to of his wife
is voiced by my wife, Ann.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Oh, really?</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah.</i>
<i>And then, Joe, of course,
plays the doctor</i>
<i>that he has to dispatch with.</i>
<i>So, I remember Brühl said to me
at one point, he goes,</i>
<i>"So, I've killed your brother
and married your wife." He goes...</i>
(LAUGHTER)
MARKUS: <i>But it also means
that in this movie,</i>
<i>you've gotten to kill your brother
and your wife.</i>
McFEELY: <i>That's right.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>It's too complicated.</i>
MARKUS: <i>You're a disturbing man.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Yeah.</i>
<i>When the dust cleared...</i>
JOE: <i>We like complex villains.
We like villains that, um,</i>
<i>that are unsettling.
And they're unsettling</i>
<i>because, you know, they're...</i>
<i>Either something
that they say has a truth to it.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Right.</i>
JOE: <i>But they're sociopathic...</i>
<i>Or, you know, like in the case of Zemo,</i>
<i>his family was murdered, you know?</i>
<i>So, you know, the Avengers...</i>
<i>The movie being
about collateral damage,</i>
<i>the collateral damage happened
to the wrong guy.</i>
<i>A guy who was trained
with a specific skill set,</i>
<i>who knew, uh, how to get
where he needed to go</i>
<i>in order to create this problem,
this internal problem.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>But also being conscious of,
like, the past movies.</i>
<i>That's the other thing I love about this
is, Brühl, like us...</i>
<i>Or not Brühl, but Zemo,</i>
<i>has seen what the Avengers
have done, like the audiences.</i>
<i>Like we've seen the Avengers
defeat everybody.</i>
<i>-Zemo's seen them...</i>
-McFEELY: <i>Right.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Defeat everybody
as a human in this world.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Yes, he's been a human
on Earth.</i> (LAUGHS)
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah. So, he's smart
enough, to move the story forward,</i>
<i>he knows he has to go
at them in a different way.</i>
McFEELY: <i>It's one big web, right?
And so, part of the story design is,</i>
<i>it's all the same theme, right?</i>
<i>I mean, when you have
15 different players,</i>
<i>if they're coming in
with 15 different stories,</i>
<i>this is gonna be a mess.</i>
<i>But they're all coming in</i>
<i>with similar, um, thematic needs. Right?</i>
<i>It's all based on the same idea,</i>
<i>which is that these heroes
have gone too far.</i>
JOE: <i>Part of T'Challa's growth arc is
that he understands that, you know...</i>
McFEELY: <i>What's going on downstairs.</i>
JOE: <i>No, what's going on downstairs,</i>
<i>but also</i>
<i>that Zemo went down a very dark path,
out of a need for revenge.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Right.</i>
JOE: <i>Indulge that part of yourself</i>
McFEELY: <i>We play Panther's arc
in very few notes...</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah.</i>
McFEELY: <i>You know,</i>
<i>and it's not that easy to do.</i>
<i>And Chadwick is part
of the reason you can do it.</i>
JOE: <i>Yeah.</i>
MARKUS: <i>And we couldn't resist
bringing back this line.</i>
McFEELY: <i>It was a little self-indulgent.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah, well, you guys...</i>
<i>Well, that's another thing that I love
you guys do is just your knowledge of...</i>
<i>The history of the whole MCU,
but also the...</i>
<i>Specifically, the large part of it
that you guys wrote is just, it's so...</i>
<i>It's always alive in everything
you're executing that's new,</i>
<i>which is really fun.</i>
JOE: <i>We wanted this to be
a brutal grudge match</i>
<i>between these characters.</i>
<i>And obviously,
in that moment, just for the smallest</i>
<i>fraction of a second,
to make you believe</i>
<i>that that shield might go
into Tony's face.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Yeah.</i>
JOE: <i>Um,
but Cap is not that kinda person.</i>
<i>Cap is the kinda person,
no matter how much he loses control,</i>
<i>who at the end of the day
is purely trying to end the fight.</i>
<i>Uh, which is when, if you go back
and look at the sequence,</i>
<i>just about everything that Cap does,</i>
<i>-every move he makes...</i>
-McFEELY: <i>Is to disable, yeah.</i>
JOE: <i>Is to disable.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Right.</i>
McFEELY: <i>But that just, really,
it's very well-directed,</i>
<i>because I have heard
more than once people saying,</i>
<i>"I really thought he was gonna kill him."
And then I realized I had gone too far.</i>
<i>-Exactly.</i>
-ANTHONY: <i>That's cool.</i>
JOE: <i>And look, that was
the hardest thing to do in the film,</i>
<i>without question,
was to balance the characters.</i>
<i>Uh, and constantly recalibrate
through the writing,</i>
<i>through the acting, through editorial,</i>
<i>to make sure that you could walk out
of the movie and really be conflicted</i>
<i>and I think when we had
our last test screening,</i>
<i>we had 30 people who stayed after.</i>
<i>We asked them some questions.
The last question we asked them was,</i>
<i>"How many believe Cap
did the right thing?"</i>
<i>And 15 people raised their hand.</i>
<i>"How many believe
Tony did the right..."</i>
<i>-And 15 people raised their hand.</i>
-MARKUS: <i>Mmm-hmm.</i>
JOE: <i>So, when we had the split,
we went,</i>
<i>"That's it. We're done.
Lock the movie."</i>
<i>We got to that place where,
you know, this is...</i>
<i>The ending is controversial,</i>
<i>which we believe
is the best storytelling.</i>
<i>-Um, you know, had we...</i>
-McFEELY: <i>It's the most honest.</i>
JOE: <i>Yes. Had we committed to
a point of view as storytellers,</i>
<i>it makes it too simple.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Right.</i>
JOE: <i>It makes the story too simple.</i>
McFEELY: <i>We would've created
a straw man somewhere along the line.</i>
JOE: <i>Yeah. And what's the point
of having two heroes fight each other</i>
<i>unless you want to...</i>
<i>You should confuse
the audience's sympathies.</i>
MARKUS: <i>They've both been
dirtied up a little bit.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>But we could've
mind-controlled one of them.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Yes...</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Turned them evil.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Possible. Yes...</i>
-MARKUS: <i>Just you wait.</i>
-(LAUGHTER)
<i>So how does it feel?</i>
<i>To spend all that time,
all that effort...</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Again, simple scene...</i>
MARKUS: <i>I like simple selection.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Two great actors.</i>
McFEELY: <i>That's right.</i>
<i>...to see it fail so spectacularly?</i>
<i>Did it?</i>
JOE: <i>Is it over?
Could it ever be over now?</i>
<i>I mean, sometimes things happen
on an emotional level</i>
<i>between friends
that can never be repaired.</i>
<i>I don't know if this
can ever be repaired.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>It's hard to imagine
how it would be.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Right.</i>
JOE: <i>Vision.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Lonely Vision.</i>
TONY: It's just the first pass.
JAMES RHODES: Yeah.
MARKUS: <i>And I will say
Rhodey is recovering</i>
<i>very quickly from spinal injuries.</i>
McFEELY: <i>He's got a little tech.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Stark tech.</i>
McFEELY: <i>This is not to say
that we want to wipe that away.</i>
<i>I think it's a very interesting thing
for Don Cheadle to play going toward.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Right. And not just
the physical part of it</i>
<i>but the emotional part of it, right?</i>
JOE: <i>Well, look, it's the, you know...</i>
<i>Um, there's been some...</i>
<i>People gripe about the fact
that the Marvel Universe</i>
<i>never does away with their characters</i>
<i>or kills anybody, and so,
that diminishes stakes.</i>
<i>And Rhodey is definitely dealing
with this moving toward.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>This is the kind of
experience that changes a person.</i>
JOE: <i>The thing about this movie,
though, was it was not...</i>
<i>This a film about divorce.</i>
<i>It's a family getting divorced
from one another.</i>
<i>If you then were to kill a character,
it becomes a movie</i>
<i>about a family getting divorced</i>
<i>and then somebody dies
while they're getting divorced.</i>
<i>Those are two different stories
that you're telling.</i>
<i>What we wanted people to walk out
of the theater with, all of us, was...</i>
ANTHONY: <i>The tragedy.</i>
JOE: <i>The tragedy
of a family falling apart.</i>
<i>-Not the tragedy of, somebody's dead.</i>
-McFEELY: <i>Right.</i>
JOE: <i>Uh, which
would've overshadowed</i>
<i>the tragedy of them falling apart.</i>
McFEELY: <i>I'm not saying that you can't
have stakes when people die,</i>
<i>but it is, I think,
often a shorthand for stakes.</i>
JOE: <i>It is.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Right.</i>
JOE: <i>It's a way to cheat stakes.</i>
MARKUS: <i>It also means they almost...</i>
<i>If they have any redeeming qualities,
they have to come together...</i>
McFEELY: <i>Right. It's much more likely
they'd come together.</i>
MARKUS: <i>After that death.</i>
JOE: <i>Yeah.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Exactly. It's a different story.</i>
JOE: <i>It alters the whole intent
of the movie, again,</i>
<i>which is for you to walk out and go,</i>
<i>"I don't know who was right
and who was wrong in that movie."</i>
<i>They both did some good things</i>
<i>and they both did
some really bad things.</i>
<i>This is on-character for Cap.</i>
<i>He is certainly the kind of guy</i>
<i>no matter how bad something gets,
who will always own</i>
<i>um, his participation in that issue,
that mistake.</i>
<i>Uh, you know, he is good
at processing his emotions.</i>
<i>They never get the better of him.</i>
McFEELY: <i>And he's not apologizing
for backing Bucky.</i>
<i>He's apologizing for lying to Tony.</i>
JOE: <i>Yeah,
for withholding that information.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Right. It's very specific.</i>
JOE: <i>He's very specific about that.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>I love that distinction,
though.</i>
JOE: <i>And it does not imply repair
with these characters.</i>
<i>It's purely Cap being Cap,
which is, you know, like I said,</i>
<i>-stating his culpability in the situation.</i>
-MARKUS: <i>Yeah.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>"Here's where I failed.
But only here."</i>
McFEELY: <i>I mean, it's a sliver of hope.
MARKUS: "Well, if you need me..."</i>
ANTHONY: <i>On Cap's part it is.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Right. Yes.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>You know, certainly
we can't read much out of Tony.</i>
McFEELY: <i>I guess
it depends on what I think.</i>
<i>Does he smile here? Does he...</i>
JOE: <i>Tony. No. I think...</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Not really.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Maybe he's less tense.
But I don't know.</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>
JOE: <i>I mean, you know, the thing is,
when somebody who is a, you know...</i>
<i>And I'm not implying that again this is...</i>
<i>'Cause Cap may have done
worse things in the movie</i>
<i>than Tony did,</i>
<i>but when somebody
who is better than you</i>
<i>or of greater moral character than you,</i>
<i>uh, then, you know, apologizes,
it's difficult for you not</i>
<i>to have a moment of self-realization.</i>
<i>Uh, and I think Tony certainly has that,
which is why</i>
<i>he then puts Ross on hold.</i>
<i>It's his way of rejecting,
if just momentarily,</i>
<i>the deal that he's made
with the government.</i>
<i>And trying to gain control back.</i>
JOE: <i>Where's this gonna go?</i>
(McFEELY CHUCKLES)
JOE: <i>Uh, all I can say is I really...</i>
<i>I cannot wait to put Chris Evans
in the Nomad outfit.</i>
-(McFEELY LAUGHS)
<i>-I really, I just... I can't wait.</i>
McFEELY: <i>He just got back
from his fitting, right?</i>
MARKUS: <i>Yeah, you cut it all the way
down to the belly button.</i>
JOE: <i>Yeah. No, went past the navel.</i>
JOE: <i>Past it.</i>
<i>Past it.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Just a hint of things
to come down there.</i>
JOE: <i>That's a lot of character
in that chest of Chris's.</i>
McFEELY: (LAUGHS) <i>That's right.</i>
<i>Uh, so, this credit sequence was done
by a dear friend of ours.</i>
<i>Who also did the credits
for</i> Community.
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah, Erin Sarofsky.
We've been working with her for years.</i>
<i>She runs an incredible
design company in Chicago.</i>
JOE: <i>But she did
the</i> Community <i>credits.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah,</i> Community.
ANTHONY: <i>Happy Endings.</i>
JOE: <i>She did
the</i> Happy Endings <i>credits,</i>
<i>she did the</i> Winter Soldier <i>credits,
and she did these credits.</i>
<i>Uh, and what we love about her work
is it's always very thematic.</i>
And striking visually.
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah, the thing is,
I mean that's...</i>
<i>Joe and I, in all of our collaborations,</i>
<i>no matter what position it is
in the filmmaking process,</i>
<i>we love to find people
who are filmmakers.</i>
<i>You know, who understand
the craft of storytelling</i>
<i>and are using whatever specific craft
they do in the service of storytelling.</i>
<i>And that's you know, it's...</i>
<i>I mean, it makes our job
a lot easier as directors</i>
<i>when all our collaborators
are doing that. So...</i>
JOE: <i>Also, this is
a little bit darker tone,</i>
<i>these credits,
than the other Marvel credits.</i>
<i>So, it's in line with the movie.</i>
<i>We wanted a complex ending
at the movie.</i>
<i>We didn't want to tell you
everything was right</i>
<i>by suddenly having
a colorful credit sequence.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Mmm-hmm.</i>
You sure about this?
I can't trust my own mind.
JOE: <i>Your first peek into Wakanda.</i>
<i>We were very careful here
because we wanted to make sure...</i>
<i>And this is, I think, you know...</i>
<i>Marvel Studios is starting to feel
a lot like United Artists.</i>
<i>And, um, you know, we are very close
to a lot of the other directors,</i>
<i>uh, writers, you know?</i>
<i>Everybody knows each other,
has a history with each other.</i>
<i>E-mails, texts. Um...</i>
<i>And, you know, it was important to us</i>
<i>that even though we were giving
a glimpse into Wakanda,</i>
<i>that Ryan Coogler, who is going
to be spending a lot of thought</i>
<i>and time and energy</i>
<i>thinking about Wakanda
with his creative team,</i>
<i>that he really be afforded
the opportunity to put that on film.</i>
McFEELY: <i>As clean a slate
as you could give him.</i>
JOE: <i>Absolutely.</i>
<i>So, we knew
we needed this storytelling,</i>
<i>but we also didn't want to make any
of those creative decisions.</i>
<i>Especially because, again,
we're only giving it to you in a minute.</i>
<i>And he's gonna be spending
an entire film doing it. So...</i>
McFEELY: <i>And that storytelling
is a button on T'Challa's,</i>
<i>you know, metanoia.
His change of heart.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>That's important, yeah.</i>
<i>Again, this is one of my favorite beats,
to be honest with you.</i>
<i>The fact that he's trying
to right the wrongs</i>
<i>that he's done in the movie.</i>
<i>The guy he's been
trying to kill the whole movie,</i>
<i>he's gonna harbor him.</i>
<i>You know, the guy who he's been
fighting the whole movie,</i>
<i>he now offers to fight alongside him.
You know, that's pretty amazing.</i>
JOE: <i>Well, and he expresses,
the first time we meet him,</i>
<i>a distaste for politics.</i>
<i>-And then when Cap says, well...</i>
-McFEELY: <i>That's right.</i>
JOE: <i>"The politics may come for you,"
he says, "Let them try." So...</i>
<i>He is a man of integrity.</i>
<i>Uh, and his own</i>
<i>internal code is what
is most important to him.</i>
<i>Uh, against all odds
or against everything else,</i>
<i>he will support his own internal code.</i>
<i>And even more so now because
he realized he had made a mistake.</i>
<i>And that life sometimes can trick you.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>The length of the credits
in these movies</i>
<i>is always so amazing to me.</i>
McFEELY: <i>That's a testament
to how these things get made.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>It's so true.</i>
MARKUS: <i>And also,
you're just trying to torture people.</i>
<i>'Cause they know they've gotta sit
through the whole damn thing.</i>
McFEELY: <i>They know there's...
That's right.</i> (LAUGHS)
ANTHONY: (LAUGHS) <i>Yeah.</i>
McFEELY: <i>But it shows you
how collaborative an art form it is.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Exactly.</i>
McFEELY: <i>I mean, it's...</i>
McFEELY: <i>There's a lot of ways movies
can get, uh, mitigated, right?</i>
<i>I mean,
there's a lot of reasons they work,</i>
<i>and there's a lot of reasons
they don't work.</i>
JOE: <i>Yeah.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Wanna spoil Infinity War?</i>
MARKUS: <i>Yeah.</i>
JOE: <i>Let's do it.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Go on. Do it.</i>
JOE: <i>Should we talk about...</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Dare ya.</i>
McFEELY: <i>I dare ya.</i> (LAUGHS)
McFEELY: <i>I think Doc could cut us off
pretty quickly.</i> (LAUGHS)
-MARKUS: <i>They just lost it at the end.</i>
-(McFEELY LAUGHS)
JOE: <i>Uh, coming up,
we do have a Peter Parker tag.</i>
<i>Maybe we could talk
about the process with tags.</i>
<i>You know, because everything's
evolving always at Marvel.</i>
<i>There are other movies being shot
while we're shooting or in post.</i>
<i>Um, it's really, you know,</i>
<i>the tags are probably
the one thing on both</i>
Winter Soldier <i>and this movie</i>
<i>that we shot in, um...</i>
McFEELY: <i>In pickups. Yeah.
JOE: Pickups.</i>
<i>Because it's really...</i>
<i>It's the hardest thing to know</i>
<i>where you want to go
at the end of the story.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Right.</i>
MARKUS: <i>Yeah.</i>
JOE: <i>And it gives you the opportunity
to do two different things.</i>
<i>Our first one is about closure,</i>
<i>uh, and our second one is comedic,
but also pointing towards, uh,</i>
<i>another franchise. So, the end...</i>
MARKUS: <i>They both point
towards franchises.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Yeah.</i>
JOE: <i>Interconnected... Well, they're
about the interconnected universe.</i>
<i>And, um, that the stories will continue
in these other movies.</i>
McFEELY: <i>And Marvel always bakes in,
uh, resources for reshoots.</i>
<i>And I will say on both</i> Winter Soldier
<i>and</i> Civil War,
<i>very little in terms of reshoots, right?</i>
JOE: <i>But very targeted
and it's something we used to do</i>
<i>on</i> Arrested <i>and</i> Community, <i>as well.</i>
<i>You're constantly reshooting</i>
<i>because you have to
deliver the episode.</i>
<i>You always have a set running</i>
<i>and you're usually on the same sets.</i>
<i>So, it's very easy for you
to run downstairs</i>
<i>and fix a scene on a television show,</i>
<i>uh, and edit it and still get it
on the air the next day,</i>
<i>um, because you want to be
working towards</i>
<i>the best version of that episode.</i>
<i>Are there story holes?
Great, let's fix 'em.</i>
<i>Did that scene not turn out the way
that we wanted to? Great, let's fix it.</i>
<i>Are we off on tone here?
Great, let's fix that.</i>
<i>And so, I think that, um, you know,</i>
<i>one of the reasons that
Marvel is so successful</i>
<i>is that the process is always evolving.</i>
<i>They are never finished with the movie.</i>
<i>You don't edit it and then lock it
and say you're done.</i>
<i>What you do is you edit it,</i>
<i>you keep thinking about it,</i>
<i>you massage it,
you massage it through the VFX,</i>
<i>you can make alterations
to the story that way.</i>
<i>All of us sit around and we talk
about where we may have missed.</i>
<i>We collect information
from the test audiences</i>
<i>and think about where story points
that are confusing,</i>
<i>that we thought weren't confusing,
but now are confusing.</i>
<i>Because when you keep hearing...</i>
<i>And you have to know how to read
an audience like tea leaves.</i>
<i>You can't take their literal notes
'cause it'll destroy your film.</i>
<i>But what you can do is</i>
<i>if you keep hearing
the same thing over and over again,</i>
<i>know that there might be
a problem in that area.</i>
McFEELY: <i>They give you the symptom,</i>
<i>and then you have to
come up with the diagnosis.</i>
<i>If they give you the diagnosis,
that's trouble.</i>
JOE: <i>And having reshoots available
to you, allows you to fix the problem,</i>
<i>uh, in a very targeted way. And frankly,
I think on both... Both movies</i>
<i>took a big leap forward</i>
<i>even with just
two or three days of reshoots.</i>
McFEELY: <i>It was not very much.</i>
<i>And I shouldn't say that
Marvel doesn't give you...</i>
<i>Marvel will give you
the resources required.</i>
<i>I'm just saying that because of all
the work the four of us did in prep,</i>
<i>not a lot on the cutting room floor,</i>
<i>which means you had a little chance
to turn C scenes into A scenes.</i>
JOE: <i>Right. You don't wanna waste
resources on a movie like this.</i>
<i>It was too expensive, it's too difficult,
it's too hard to get these actors back.</i>
<i>You gotta get it as right as you can
the first time out.</i>
<i>But invariably, there are thousands
of choices that get made.</i>
<i>And even if you're off on about 4%</i>
<i>or 5% of those choices, you're still...</i>
<i>That's still 5% of the movie
you can make better.</i>
<i>Uh, and that's what
those reshoots are about.</i>
<i>And sometimes you're off
on 50% and you know...</i>
McFEELY: <i>Well,
that's a bigger problem.</i>
JOE: <i>And you're in
for 30 days of reshoots.</i>
<i>But the fact that their motive
and their goal is</i>
<i>to put out the best piece
of content that they can</i>
<i>is why they are
as successful as they are.</i>
(MUSIC PLAYING)
WOMAN: (SINGING)
Well, my left hands free
Well, my left hands free
(VOCALIZING)
Hey, shady baby, I'm hot
Like the prodigal son
JOE: <i>And I think here we're leading in.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah, we sort of return
to Spider-Man's signature song.</i>
JOE: <i>I think this scene was reworked
more than any scene in the movie.</i>
MARKUS: <i>It was several different ones.
JOE: This tag. Yeah.</i>
JOE: <i>Try.ng to light on what it is that,
you know,</i>
<i>how we wanted to advance the story.</i>
<i>And ultimately,
it becomes about the fact that,</i>
<i>what makes Spider-Man different
in the Marvel Universe</i>
<i>was that his suit
was created by Tony Stark,</i>
<i>which means that there might be</i>
<i>-some technical enhancements that...</i>
-McFEELY: <i>Extra doodads. Yeah.</i>
MARKUS: <i>I love Marisa Tomei
in this scene 'cause she's...</i>
<i>It gives me an idea of a totally different
dynamic than I've seen before.</i>
<i>She's almost pleased
that he was in a fight.</i>
<i>As opposed
to Aunt May who's, you know...</i>
ANTHONY: <i>I also think
there's a little bit of...</i>
<i>Yeah, it's not quite
the same naivety and...</i>
McFEELY: <i>Right.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>There's a savviness to her.</i>
JOE: <i>Well, she has his number.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Yeah.</i>
You know?
Yeah, I got quite a few in, actually.
JOE: <i>And it's a kid.
He's not a great liar.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>His friend was huge.
That, by the way, was Tom Holland.</i>
McFEELY: <i>Is that right? Yeah.</i>
ANTHONY: <i>Yeah.</i>
<i>That's what happens when you rub up
