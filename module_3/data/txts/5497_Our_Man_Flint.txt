Gentlemen? Gentlemen, it's quite true.
The weather continues to defy nature.
Overnight the temperature
at the Arctic has risen 4.9'F.
Gentlemen! Another five degrees
and Haifa Harbour is completely under water!
It's true. New York, San Francisco, New
Orleans, Marseilles - every port's in danger.
- Who is doing this? And why?
- It's the work of madmen.
Mad, sane...
They're brilliant.
They're demonstrating that
they can control the weather!
Turn wheat belts into deserts,
put icebergs in the Mediterranean.
- Control the weather, you control the world.
- What do they want?
- Why haven't they contacted us?
- Oh, they will.
But we're not going to wait for them.
We've just had our first break.
According to this dispatch I just received,
our team of agents has them cornered!
At any second...
It was a trap.
We just lost another team of agents.
- They know every move we make!
- They have a superb intelligence unit.
How can I find that laboratory
if I keep losing manpower?
- How about 0008?
- Unfortunately he is not available.
- International narcotics.
- Please. We can't use 0008.
They have a file on all our personnel. We
have to recruit from outside the organisation.
Well,
if you'll write down the qualifications
you believe necessary for the assignment,
our computer'll give us the ideal man.
Stand by computers.
Derek Flint! My country awarded him
the Croix de Guerre!
- Flint's wrong for this job.
- Wasn't he under your command in the war?
- Forget it. He can't take orders.
- Derek Flint! Three promotions in a month!
- And our Medal of Honor.
- I said forget it!
Excellent chap, expert frogman.
Name's Derek Flint.
We need a man who can follow regulations!
We need a man who's disciplined! I...
- Flint.
- Flint.
- Flint.
- Flint.
I don't care what these computers say.
I know this man. He just...
Yes, sir?
Yeah? Well, uh...
Well, how did you know, sir?
Very well, sir.
Yes, sir. Well, of course,
that's your privilege, sir.
Well, if that's your wish.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Very good, sir.
Very well, gentlemen, uh... Derek Flint.
Mr Cramden wants...
Mr Flint? General Hawkins.
Mr Cramden wants...
What do you mean, he said no? I sent you...
Yes, sir?
But I sent General Hawkins himself, sir.
Yes, sir. I'll contact Flint personally.
Yes, sir. It'll be a pleasure, sir.
Sir?
Flint...
Lower your hand slowly and smile.
- What?
- If he senses hostility, he'll rip you apart.
Smile, sir.
Thank you, Caesar.
Well, sir, this is a surprise.
Let me take your hat and coat.
Perhaps nudes aren't your dish of tea.
Have a cigar, sir.
No, thank you.
Breakfast, sir?
- I had lunch two hours ago.
- Oh, I must still be on Moscow time.
- Moscow? Business?
- No. Ballet, sir.
- You travelled to Moscow to watch a ballet?
- No, to teach.
- Do you mind if we talk while I shave?
- After you.
- Flint, I'm here because...
- You want something.
- Don't be clever. I came here on orders.
- Bonjour, cheri.
Bonjour, baby.
- Maybe my office is a better place to talk...
- I doubt it, sir.
Well, once you realise the importance
of this project, I know you'll be interested...
You know the high regard I have
for you and your organisation.
- Thank you.
- But I think your file on me needs updating.
You see, as of late my interests
are less governmental than personal.
All right for today?
Excellent, carissima.
Later.
Now, Flint, in the past
you and I have had our differences of...
Well, discipline is a vital factor...
that every citizen has got...
Don't wave the flag in the bathroom.
Just come to the point.
Excuse me.
Flint, the government needs you.
Yes, well, it's good to be wanted, sir.
This is the most important assignment
ever offered!
I hope you find a good man for your project.
- Ohayo gozaimasu, Derek.
- Ohayo gozaimasu, honey.
Man does not live by bread alone.
Later.
Now, Flint, every computer designated you
the best man for the job.
- That must have pleased you.
- Look, I don't bear a grudge.
- I know we've had our disagreements...
- Sir, you know it doesn't work between us.
Later, baby.
- Do you want a shave, sir?
- Flint, the world's in trouble!
It usually is, but it manages
to extricate itself without my help.
You're still the same old selfish, arrogant!
- Sir, you're getting edgy.
- Don't tell me!
Later!
Yeah?
But I...
Good evening, Monsieur Flint.
Paul, table number one.
- Thank you, Maurice.
- The pleasure is mine, Monsieur Flint. Merci.
Un moment, monsieur.
Oui, c'est d'accord. Merci.
Stand back, folks. Please stand back.
Give the man some air. Thank you very much.
Give me that candle.
Why would anyone want to kill Mr Cramden?
I think that dart was meant for me.
It seems I have ajob
whether I want one or not.
Gentlemen, the new head of our
operations team, the man you selected,
Derek Flint.
Thank you, gentlemen.
I accept this assignment.
Oh, I'm sorry about that crude incision, sir.
Thank you, gentlemen.
We'll now have a private briefing.
I owe you my life.
The medics said four more seconds...
- Three, sir.
- Dammit, is there anything you don't know?
A great many things, sir.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'll need a few hours to prepare.
It worries me when he stops his heart.
It's over three hours, isn't it?
Yes, but it does relax him.
Must be a dangerous assignment.
Ladies.
Sakito?
You call Eddie and confirm
our seats for the concert.
Gina?
Venison's almost ready to be hung.
You'll take care of it?
Leslie.
- Call Freddie and postpone my fitting.
- Till when?
- Wednesday will be all right.
- Are you sure?
Of course.
Ah.
- Your code book.
- If you don't mind, I'll use my own code.
- I'd rather you used this.
- Mine's a mathematical progression.
- 40, 26, 36. It's based on...
- I can imagine what it's based on.
Walther PPK with silencer.
High velocity, extreme penetrating power.
Yes, it's a very fine weapon.
Tempered steel.
Very effective at close range.
But I have no need for these. They're crude.
Dammit, these are the most...
Stopwatch, please.
When I nod, you start the stopwatch.
When I indicate "stop", stop.
This needle is dipped in curare.
How long did it take?
Three tenths of a second.
Now,
this contains 65 weapons.
This has 82 different functions.
83 if you wish to light a cigar.
Chemical analysis of that dart.
That's odd.
In addition to the poison,
there were traces of garlic,
saffron and fennel on the feather.
- What proportions, sir?
- Propor? Here.
Marseilles. Bouillabaisse.
Huh?
Throughout the world in the
preparation of bouillabaisse,
...the proportion of garlic
to saffron and fennel...
...is two cloves of garlic to a pinch
of saffron to a dash of fennel.
Now, only in a certain
small section of Marseilles
are these three condiments
prepared in these proportions.
Whoever handled that dart was in
Marseilles within the last 24 hours.
Goodbye, sir.
Hold it, hold it.
- These are the men under your command.
- I don't need anyone, sir.
- You said you'd join the team.
- The team isn'tjoining me.
- Dammit, man, for once you'll follow orders!
- This is my mission, sir. I work alone.
Your mission?! The US Government is
involved too, not to mention the world!
It's my show now.
You're under arrest, Flint!
I'm glad to see you kept up your karate, sir.
These men wore Battle of the Bulge ribbons.
- There's no ribbon for the Battle of the Bulge.
- Exactly. They're impostors.
Gridley? He's been with us... That's Gridley!
Sir, if you look around the eyes,
you'll see some scars.
On the bridge of the nose. Plastic surgery.
You've cracked.
All this high living - you've cracked.
In here! They're dead! In here! They're dead!
- Gridley!
- This one's gone.
I, uh... I'll arrange for your
transportation to Marseilles.
Oh, no, that won't be necessary, sir.
I have my own jet.
Your attention, please.
Paging Mr Derek Flint.
Your plane is ready, sir.
You said nine o'clock, Mr Flint.
Yes.
Thank you.
Mmm. Yes.
Check, please.
Finest bouillabaisse in Marseilles,
monsieur.
Merci, monsieur.
The shipment went as scheduled.
I had some free time, and only here do they
really make bouillabaisse. I thought...
You thought? It is your muscle
that thinks, not your brain.
And this in plain sight of everyone.
A harmless jar of cream.
A little gift for one's wife.
A harmless jar of cream? Someone in this
den of thieves stole it and examined it.
- Well, I thought...
- You will leave at once.
Look slowly to your right.
- Monsieur?
- Bouillabaisse. Une cuillere propre, eh?
Ça va.
Yeah! More! Come on, baby, come on.
Come on, let's see you work hard.
Come on, baby!
- Hello, Flint.
- 0008.
- I wanted a word with you.
- Yeah, my pleasure.
Narcotics.
A new, powerful drug. Hear anything?
- No. SPECTRE involved?
- It's bigger than SPECTRE.
Who is it?
GALAXY.
- GALAXY? Is that all?
- That's it.
- So long, 0008.
- So long, Flint.
Hans Gruber, Hitler Youth Movement,
escaped during the Nuremberg trials.
I'm a much nicer person now.
Well, I'm glad to hear it.
Appenine-Tuscan kaolin.
Water from the Pontine Marshes.
Cold cream.
87. 89.
42. 27.
34. 83.
16. 69. 16.
- Rome? Why the hell is he going to Rome?
- I don't exactly know, sir.
72. 46. 49.
"To buy ajar of cold cream".
Cold cream. Cold cream, eh?
The world is crumbling
and he's buying cold cream.
- Your report?
- Mr Flint will cause no more trouble.
An interesting statement, but not factual.
The explosion. I heard it myself.
The explosion was live,
and unfortunately so is Mr Flint.
Thanks to Rodney's desire for proof,
we discovered there were no remains.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- That you were unsuccessful again?
Rodney, you must learn patience.
Gentlemen, forgive me. You are scientists.
As such, you are accustomed to failure.
It merely increases your desire for success.
But in my business, failure is inexcusable.
We've treated Flint too lightly.
He's too dangerous to live.
Yes. We've lost several good men,
and a valued friend in Gruber.
- Gentlemen, I'd welcome the opportunity...
- We have not yet lost confiidence in Gila.
Mr Flint will cause no more trouble. I have
just received the information I requested.
You mean the impregnable Mr Flint
does have one weakness?
No, Dr Schneider. Four.
- Madam?
- Yes, would you unzipper me, please?
Thank you.
Sono certo.
Si.
Grazie.

"Am walking into... trap".
"Heading for the Exotica Beauty Factory".
"If lucky, will lead to laboratory".
"If not, please send flowers".
I'm leaving for Rome immediately.
You can contact me at the embassy.
Gila? Our visitor has arrived.
- Good. Now I can silence him permanently.
- Put away the gun.
Violence hasn't worked. You have proof of
that. Besides, how do you know he is alone?
All right, Gila.
But you'd better be right this time.
It is my responsibility to deliver Flint.
Buongiorno. Do you have an appointment?
Well, not really, but I would like
to see the manager, if at all possible.
My card.
Please, I couldn't think of accepting this.
Yes?
- There's a man here. He's very insistent...
- My name is Flint.
- I didn't...
- Thank you very much, my dear.
You have a very charming
and efficient secretary.
Mr Flint, do you always
barge into people's offices?
No, I'd rather be invited.
Come in.
I've a feeling I was expected.
Have we met before?
Twice before, Mr Flint.
Once in New York and once in Marseilles.
Oh, you must have been the blond harpist.
And Gruber's friend.
And you left me a little present.
Ajar like this, right?
- May I look inside?
- Some of them are harmless, Mr Flint.
You were right. We were expecting you.
Well,
here I am. Now, shall we
talk about the weather?
- About what?
- The weather.
Of course. But not here.
Personal matters require privacy.
Oh, you have some little place in mind?
A... a trap?
You are prepared to take some risks, no?
I'll answer all your questions.
Is that a deal?
- It's cold cream.
- Cold cream.
Yes, it's a deal.
How romantic. Rome at night.
A sky full of stars.
It is marvellous, isn't it?
You can almost see a whole galaxy from here.
Shall we discuss it further?
I thought we were gonna
talk about the weather.
You won't believe me. You're too shrewd, too
experienced to pay attention to our secret.
You try me.
They are controlling the weather
from inside a volcano.
Right. Inside a volcano.
Where? Where is this volcano?
Not so fast, Mr Flint.
There are many other details.
Get some brandy.
Now, tell me more about that volcano.
He took the key. He's on his way.
- You say you speak English?
- Yes, sir.
This man you described,
you took him to this address?
Yes. He was the one who was sitting there
figuring out the lottery numbers.
Mm? Oh. Yeah.
There's the building...
Scusate. Dov'e la casa?
Che cosa vuoi dire, tu?
Quella che stava qui.
- What's the trouble?
- There's no building.
- Will someone tell this idiot to make sense?
- All right, now what happened?
- A whole building disappeared.
- A whole building...
- Do you think he?
- General, I didn't have anything to drink.
Now, just a minute.
Nobody's accusing you of anything.
- We both know there was a building there.
- Si.
- And buildings can't disappear into thin air.
- Si.
- So what happened to the building?
- It disappeared into thin air.
Great intelligence work.
Your next post will be Peyton Place!
You talk about discipline.
- Why did you stop me from killing Flint?
- Are you questioning my loyalty?
No, no.
I merely thought you might have felt...
certain stirrings.
You are romantic yourself, Rodney.
There's very little air in that safe.
Flint will die of suffocation.
- Your way would have been kinder.
- My apologies, Gila.
How very thoughtful you are.
16. 69. 62.
62. 16. 27.
25. 41. 32.
"Have discovered location
of enemy headquarters".
"Advise you send fleet there
at once and destroy it".
Congratulations on the capture of Flint.
You have done well, Section Four.
You will be pleased to know Flint's four
playmates have arrived at headquarters,
and are now in the process
of being programmed.
- Get him back! We gotta find that location!
- Yes, sir.
16. 28. 14. 49. 62.
43.
That's it. That's... What's the message?
"Will give you location later".
"Am headed for...
...a family reunion. Regards, Flint".
A... family reunion?
Well, you were right. He's dead.
- You will arrange for the coffin.
- I've already arranged it.
- It's on its way.
- You were very sure.
Yes. Weren't you?
Send it.
This photograph arrived minutes ago.
It speaks for itself.
He was the best.
Undisciplined, but the best.
He was a legend.
Yes, sir? At once.
Gentlemen, your attention, please.
The television screen.
I don't know, sir.
It's on all channels.
Who are they?
People of the world,
there is no need to panic.
Please do not be alarmed.
We are your friends.
Members of the Grand Council,
you just witnessed a live transmission,
- remote-controlled from the Arctic region.
- Get a radio fix on this.
Through the inducement of regulated tremors
along established fiissures in the earth's crust...
...we are now able to control local weather
conditions throughout the world.
For the more sceptical among you,
we have prepared further proof.
On the southern edge of Iwo Jima is the
extinct volcano known as Burichabi.
In the Chukotskiy region
on the northeast tip of Russia
lies the dormant volcano
known as Amguyemska.
In exactly ten seconds,
we will cause these ancient volcanos
to erupt with a Richter force of 4.9.
Seismology reports a Richter
reading of 4.9 at both locations.
You will give orders to destroy
all your nuclear weapons,
your aircraft and your navies.
Or you will be inundated.
Get lost!
It is our view that under our guidance
we will have a more productive world.
You have just one hour...
to transmit your answer
on any frequency you choose.
We will receive it.
Between now and then
we reluctantly jam all airwaves,
with the exception of your
telephone communications.
I've been instructed to have you confer
with your governments and reconvene here
no later than 45 minutes
from now... with your answers.
Take over.
Gila, we're approaching the island.
Do you want to go on deck?
Oh, no. Why force them
to turn off the waterfall?
What nonsense. As if there
could be a man like that.
I believe your friend in the box there
was brought up on stuff like that.
Poor heroic Mr Flint.
- Report, please.
- Section Four reporting. Mission successful.
You have proof? After all, you have
made quite a few unsuccessful attempts.
- That's true, Dr Wu, but...
- Valuable time has been wasted.
Several colleagues have been lost,
and all through sheer negligence.
Had I been in charge, Dr Wu, things would
have been different. Flint was only a man.
Mr Flint was no ordinary man!
- We have his body with us.
- How unfortunate there was no other way.
Report to headquarters. And congratulations
on the elimination of Flint.
No! Help!
14. 42.
Absolutely no one is getting through, sir.
Gentlemen, I give you Mr Flint.
18. 27. 14.
27. 18. 42.
Come on.
Say, why does that eagle attack me?
He's been trained to recognise
and attack Americans.
An anti-American eagle.
It's diabolical.
Come on. We can't keep 'em waiting.
Mr Flint,
I am Dr Krupov.
Doctor.
I am very happy to meet you in person.
- Thank you, sir.
- And this is Dr Wu and Dr Schneider.
- How do you do?
- Dr Schneider.
Dr Wu.
Gentlemen... I have not had
the pleasure of meeting Mr Flint.
I am Malcolm Rodney.
Oh, yes.
How very smart you look
in your GALAXY uniform, Mr Flint.
Don't you think so, Gila?
We found this in his pocket, sir.
The Americans' fondness
for marvellous toys!
A weapon too, perhaps?
You are obviously an
extraordinary fellow, Mr Flint.
That you have come this far
is a great tribute, Mr Flint.
- Well, thank you.
- I would say it's more of a tribute to Gila.
- To Gila?
- Yes.
Or rather to her individuality.
She has allowed self-interest
to supersede her loyalty to GALAXY.
- If Rodney had shown me more loyalty...
- I carried out your orders.
We were unsuccessful three times.
- I could have disposed of Flint!
- Gila, Rodney is right.
As head of Section Four, you were
responsible for every mission.
But I have given my life to GALAXY.
Gentlemen, it seems to me
that what it comes to is this:
In a moment of extreme decision,
our dear Gila made an instinctive choice.
But that choice was not for GALAXY.
Her conditioning is incomplete.
It is our mistake.
We made a sentimental misjudgment.
True, Dr Schneider. True. You understand,
Gila. Now, you will be taken to the...
No. It's not fair.
Gila, GALAXY may be served in many ways.
As a woman, there is one way
in which you may best serve GALAXY.
Gila! Gila!
Take her to Preparation.
Take her to Preparation.
How often woman's animal nature triumphs!
Perhaps now, Dr Wu,
you'll admit that I was correct.
Strength has its merits, Rodney,
but I value intelligence higher.
Gentlemen, Mr Flint's seemingly limitless
talents can be of value to GALAXY.
- Of course.
- Yes.
- I think Mr Flint has outlived his usefulness.
- We will be the judge of that, Mr Rodney.
Mr Flint, we welcome you to GALAXY.
- To GALAXY!
- To GALAXY!
Gentlemen,
I thank you very much for your kind offer,
but you must know that I came to GALAXY
...not to join the organisation,
but to destroy it.
You see, gentlemen? He's not worth saving.
When something is deadly, you kill it!
It is a new world we offer, Mr Flint.
Gentlemen, your price
is much too high for me.
You are wrong, Mr Flint.
Hear us, Mr Flint.
We seek no master race.
We are the friends of the common man.
Surely you must have noticed
the absence of guns here in our paradise.
Violence is a last resort.
It was only the unenlightened resistance of
a decadent world that triggered our actions.
Under our guidance you will
become a useful scientist.
Take him to Preparation.
Wait!
Gentlemen, I'm sorry.
But all my instincts tell me that
Mr Flint's archaic sense of independence may
eventually re-emerge, with disruptive results.
Dr Krupov is right.
Flint will never conform.
It may be best to return him
to his elements.
The electro-fragmentiser.
I wonder what it is that always makes
the Rodneys choose the wrong side.
Enjoy your defiance.
It'll be the last pleasure
you have on this earth.
You're a foolish man, Mr Flint.
Gentlemen, the temperature in the Arctic
is still rising, and so is the water level.
Sir? It's unanimous.
Capitulation.
The fleet is in readiness?
Yes, sir.
Request permission to join
Admiral Davenport in my old unit.
Thank you, sir. I'll leave at once.
Thank you, sir.
Repeat: My sole purpose in life
is to bring pleasure to my companions.
My sole purpose in life is to bring
pleasure to my companions.
All that is asked of me I will perform.
All that is asked of me I will perform.
It is an honour to offer my body
to the service of GALAXY.
It is an honour to offer my body
to the service of GALAXY.
Repeat after me: I am not a pleasure unit.
I am not a pleasure unit.
I am not a pleasure unit.
I am not a pleasure unit.
We have to get up to that
communications room. My lighter...
Our lighter has been fragmentised.
- They are expecting me in the reward room.
- Reward room? What's that?
Never mind. You'll love it.
Brand me.
What?
It's our only chance.
Go ahead.
- Present the unit, please.
- Pleasure Unit 504.
Present the unit, please.
Pleasure Unit 736.
Unit 736 is welcome here.
Enter, 736, and go to the
fiirst robing room.
It's me, Anna. You're not a pleasure unit.
You're not a pleasure unit.
You're not a pleasure unit.
Now listen, girls. You stay right here
with Gila. I'll be back for you all shortly.
Where are you going?
I'm going to put GALAXY into orbit.
Ladies and gentlemen,
the president of the United States.
My fellow Americans, what I have
to say does not come easily.
But I cannot shirk my responsibility,
nor can I keep from you the gravity
of the crisis we are now facing.
It is with a heavy heart that I make
the following announcement:
People of all nations,
all of you know something of
the events of the past few weeks...
- Flint?!
- It can't be!
Of course it can. That's why he's Flint.
Purple alert!
- We have all been witness...
- Purple alert. Purple alert.
All units, air and naval.
The mountain island,
latitude 18 degrees 9 minutes north,
longitude 11 degrees 3 minutes west.
Destroy! Destroy!
Commander, the bridge.
Are you there, sir? Sir, stall!
Stall, dammit! Flint is alive!
Uh, no, uh...
- No great decision...
- 54, 22, 37.
- Does anyone know this code?
- No.
- No.
- Well, it must have some meaning.
Communications room, Dr Wu speaking.
Come in, please.
Communications room?
Dr Krupov. Come in, please.
- Come in, please. Dr Schneider calling.
- Rodney, check communications room.
Communications room?
Dr Schneider speaking. Come in.
Communications room, come in...
Attention. Attention.
Flint has escaped. Find him.
Find him.
There he is! Get him!
Aargh!
- Get back! The wheel!
- The steam!
Somebody kill the steam!
I'll get it... Aargh!
Get Flint!
Up there!
Aargh!
Aargh!
Don't, Mr Flint! You will destroy the potential
of all of mankind, organised for good.
- Not for my good, Dr Wu.
- Mr Flint!
It would mean an end for all time to
poverty, disease, doubt and frustration!
Mr Flint, we have the power to do
away with excessive heat and cold!
- To turn wastelands into Gardens of Eden!
- All I have to do is take a bite of your apple?
- No, thanks.
- No, Mr Flint!
- Mr Flint! No!
- Mr Flint!
Ours would be a perfect world! Why?
Because it's your idea of
perfection, gentlemen, not mine.
It is better to surrender than to
destroy this great work. Agreed?
- Yes! Yes!
- Agreed!
All right, Mr Flint. The power is yours.
Take it.
Please, take it, Mr Flint.
There has been too much violence.
- It is senseless to take more lives.
- It is not senseless to take one more life!
Hey! Come on!
You people out there, pay attention!
- Lower a boat.
- Aye aye, sir.
Blankets.
Bring them up to the bridge.
Sir?
Yes, sir?
Yeah! Over a waterfall, sir.
Yes, in steel drums.
Yeah, that's right. In drums!
D-r-u-m-s.
Yes. Oh, he wrecked the whole island!
He had no drum, he dove off the top
of the island. Gotta be a world record!
No, sir, I don't know his political affiliation.
He is young enough to be a senator, yes, sir.
I believe he's aboard, sir. Would
you like to speak with him? Yeah.
Flint? Flint, our commander in chief
would like to...
The commander in chief would like
to congratulate you and your friend.
Flint!
I'm sorry, he's indisposed
at the moment, sir.
What?
I can't hear ya!
