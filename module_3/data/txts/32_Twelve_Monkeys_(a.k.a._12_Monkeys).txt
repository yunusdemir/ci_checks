Previously on "12 Monkeys"...
Every time I splinter, it feels like I'm
being ripped apart from the inside.
Time, it's going to take what it's owed.
I'm still holding on to the memory
of her, trapped in that tiny room,
holding on to her dead little hand.
That's your little girl?
That's what this is for you?
Your daughter is the past.
This treatment was a temporary solution
for your condition.
We are out of time.
Splinter Mr Cole to 2015.
- We could lose him forever!
- We have to!
Cole.
They've been one step ahead
the whole way.
I know who the witness is.
- Aaron Marker?
- Who are you?
Dr Railly is very important.
What are you willing to do
to keep her alive?
I can protect you now.
I wanna be a daughter again.
Goines.
You wanna see
what a paradox looks like?
What just happened?
Mother nature doesn't like it when you
rearrange her furniture.
Take this. Keep it to yourself.
- What is it?
- It's why I brought you here.
Your life depends on it.
ADLER: There's no sign of Cole's tracer.
We had it in 2015 for a moment,
but there's been nothing
in more than 24 hours.
Stop looking.
But if Mr Cole did
splinter successfully...
He did.
Mr Cole barely made it alive to 1987.
You saw what condition he was in,
and that was before
the splinter to 2015.
God knows what further damage that did.
He survived... but he won't come back.
So... that's all?
We just abandon him there?
I'm afraid it is we who are abandoned...
Dr Adler.
So, Cole is just a memory now.
As the past was intended to be.
This morning, yesterday... or 30 years,
it's all just a million
firing neurons...
...given meaning by the human mind.
We'll all be there eventually.
I return
Seems a long time
We seem like old times
(MAN SPEAKS GERMAN)
(SPEAKS GERMAN)
When we are in New York,
we speak English.
I need the practice.
Your English is fine.
I don't understand why you want to
work in an American laboratory anyway,
just because your husband...
It has nothing to do with my husband.
Raritan Valley is the only facility
in the world
focused on quantum splintering.
I thought you'd be proud of me.
I am, Kat.
I just wish it weren't so far away.
Your mother and I
miss having you in Berlin,
and with your medical training,
you...
I'm not interested in medicine.
- I'm not good with people.
- If you'd only try.
Our bodies were built to die.
Why should I waste my research
trying to heal them
when I can put it to such better use?
Better use than prolonging human life?
If your prototypes,
though I barely understand them,
can prevent the effects of time
on human cells at a molecular level,
think of the possibilities.
What aren't you telling me?
Did Elliott...?
Please, let's not discuss my ex-husband.
Past is past. It was a mistake.
Falling in love is never a mistake.
Love can't be calculated or predicted.
Which is why
I don't have any use for it.
You can't live by science alone.
It's the heart, not the mind,
that sustains us.
Goodnight, Papa.
- I love you.
- Goodnight.
35 and 36, please.
- DR RAILLY: Katarina Jones?
- Do I know you?
My name is Dr Cassandra Railly.
I need your help.
We have a mutual friend
who is very sick.
- Maybe dying.
- Who?
Cole. James Cole.
You are probably looking for my mother.
I'm not that kind of a doctor,
I'm a physicist.
Please listen to me. We need to talk.
Well, maybe you call my office
in the morning.
There is no time.
If you don't help me, Cole will die.
And I won't let that happen.
JONES:
Time, it's going to take what it's owed.
Cole?
Cole?
What the hell are you doing?
Hey, Aaron.
Christ.
(PANTING) Aaron.
I thought you were a scav.
- What's that?
- (SIGHS) Scavenger.
From my time.
- DR RAILLY: Is anyone else here?
- No. Not any more.
OK. Get in here.
- You're the only one who can help us.
- I can't.
- I don't know what you're...
- Stop.
Just look at these.
Look.
Where did you get these?
No, this can't be real.
This is my work.
In the future,
this will all be very, very real.
- COLE: Where's Cassie?
- I don't know.
She sewed up your wound and she left.
Said she had to get help.
- What kind of help?
- She wouldn't tell me.
She doesn't tell me much any more.
Just... that all this splintering
is killing you.
But she knows someone who can help.
(SPLUTTERS)
Oh, shit. Hey. Hey!
Hey. Cole. Cole? Cole!
Cole!
AARON: Damn it.
(PHONE RINGING)
- Hey, Aaron.
- Cassie, he's not breathing.
- Does he have a pulse?
- Uh...
- No, no, there's nothing.
- OK, he's in cardiac arrest.
He needs Epinephrine. Go into
the kitchen and get my medical bag.
There's a hypodermic needle in there
in a gray box.
Hey! Wait!
OK, I got it. I got it. Now what?
Cassie, how do I do this?
Shit!
Um... OK, it goes in his thigh.
What's happening? What's happening?!
It's networking.
- Cass...
- (GASPS)
- (COUGHS)
- Wait... he's breathing.
- He's breathing.
- (GASPS)
OK, it's time for you to go.
- I have a gun.
- Yes.
But I have a knife, and unlike
your gun, my knife is real.
I'm sorry. I just thought...
This technology, it's not published.
It's just a theory.
It's a prototype serum
that I designed for Project: Splinter.
Just the one. It's not possible.
But my friend,
and one day, your... your friend...
...is from the future,
where it is possible.
You... you, the future you,
sent him here.
And now he's dying.
Please help me save him.
(COUGHS)
(COUGHS)
How long was I asleep?
You've been in and out of it
for the last few days.
(COUGHS)
I wouldn't exactly call
what you were doing sleeping.
I've seen boxing matches
that looked more restful.
Yeah, well, where I come from,
sleep's dangerous.
It's when you're
at your most vulnerable.
But you survived. That's something.
Maybe now that we know
that the plague is coming...
...how it happens, where,
we can prepare.
- Work to survive it.
- Maybe.
For a year or two.
In a bunker somewhere,
cut off from everyone, everything.
Not everyone.
You save the people that you love.
That's what matters. Right?
- Where have you been?
- Cole?
Uh... that address in your pocket,
the one the other me gave you in 2017.
- I went there.
- What did you find?
You must be Mr Cole.
Jones.
How...
You knew.
You've always known me.
It appears so.
But maybe your always
and my always are not the same.
Why didn't you tell me?
I'm sure I had my reasons.
- I need blood samples.
- (SIGHS) You don't change, do you?
I'll need a microscope.
Uh, there's one upstairs,
in the office.
I'll draw a fresh blood sample.
Come on. You need to lie down.
Come here.
- COLE: How'd you convince her?
- The way you taught me.
With a gun. And the truth.
Gun? I thought you flew to New York.
I did. The gun was a toy.
You shouldn't have brought her here.
The risk to the timeline, it's too...
I didn't tell her much.
Besides, you're dying. And she can help.
I die, you die.
Nothing anyone can do will change that.
I got Jones here, didn't I?
Jones is here
because she's always come here.
It's fate.
There's no such thing as fate.
(SIGHS) Cassie... it's over.
There's a long list
of what we don't have,
but that has never stopped us before,
and it will not stop us now.
We need new leads,
we need to rebuild our investigation.
We can't. We lost
practically everything in the fire.
We can.
And we will.
We're not giving up.
Start with our own archives.
- Here. Remount the storage drive.
- This is madness.
Just blindly forward?
Well, forward is the only direction
available at the moment.
JONES: I want everything you can find
on the 12 Monkeys.
Markridge, Goines,
Oliver Peters, Dr Railly.
Dig deep. No detail is too small.
Markridge was making
significant political contributions.
This is from Washington Dulles.
Judging by the pattern
of viral dissemination,
it would suggest air travel.
The CDC's original report
was signed by Dr Railly.
There was a break-in in this laboratory
late November.
MAN: And these murders at Markridge
were never solved.
JONES: Markridge got
a new CEO in late 2015.
Facing facts, coming to terms.
We don't need graphs and pie charts
to illustrate what a shit show
this year has been.
The death of Leland Goines,
the Operation: Troy debacle,
the vanishing of Dr Peters.
These things subjected us
to substantial economic gravity.
And we are quite frankly
hemorrhaging trust.
(MOANING, PANTING ON SCREEN)
What the hell is this?
A takeover. Hostile.
An embarrassing takeover. Move.
Jennifer, what are you doing?
He's right about trust.
If I can be frank for a moment?
Never trust a man
with an offshore account
and a mid-size chubby for redheads.
- This is ridiculous.
- (SCOFFS) Embezzlement?
Infidelity?
Friendo,
you're first mate on the Titanic
and you're filling up life boats
with caviar.
Here. It's your resignation.
As majority shareholder,
pursuant to dear Daddy,
I am exercising my right, as outlined
in article blah, subsection yadda,
to hostilely take you bitches over.
(LAUGHS)
Security.
Security?
Security...
...works for me now.
Crazy ironic. (GASPS)
Raise your hand
if you would like to be the new him.
Done. Meet the new boss.
Same as... absolutely nothing at all.
You're insane.
- (CHUCKLES)
- You should be locked up.
Charges were dropped. New evidence.
I've been set free!
- I've been...
- Released.
- No.
- Let loose?
- No.
- Un-caged?
Yes! That.
Un-caged. (CHUCKLES, GROWLS)
And I'm never, ever going back.
OK, Markridge, listen up.
I've got some ideas.
Did you find anything?
Comparing this sample
to what you showed me in New York...
...it's as you feared,
he's getting worse.
Mr Cole is going to die.
He's not just a friend.
He's more to you. Much more.
- How did you meet him?
- I told you.
They found a recording
that I make and...
...the future you sent him here
to find me.
- And you believed his story?
- No.
He brought my watch with him
from the future, and he broke time.
- The same watch from his time?
- Yes.
- That's profoundly risky.
- I know.
It caused a paradox.
It almost killed us.
(LAUGHS) Yeah.
Mother Nature doesn't like it
if you rearrange her furniture.
Right.
That must have been
extraordinary to see.
Matter coming in contact with itself.
Wait, just a moment. Uh...
When was Mr Cole born?
Uh... 2009, I think. Why?
Splintering has corrupted his genetic
composition at a molecular level.
But if his current DNA were introduced
to his original molecular structure,
it might undo the quantum shifting.
A paradox. To save his life.
Possible.
We could get a blood sample
from the original Cole.
- That might work.
- (DOOR OPENS)
(DOOR CLOSES)
Your friend has left.
Aaron.
You're leaving?
- This isn't my fight.
- Of course it is.
No. No.
See, while you're busy saving Cole
and the rest of mankind,
someone has to figure out
how to save you.
It's Aaron Marker.
I wanna make a deal.
I don't pretend to understand
what you're doing, or why,
but I am a pragmatist.
Right? A realist.
You have to be
to survive in Washington.
Survival is everything.
This isn't just about me.
- It's Cassie. Dr Railly.
- Of course.
How's it going to work?
Where are we going to go?
I need to know the details.
I'm not just gonna
take your word for it.
In time.
Mr Marker... you're a lion
protecting your pride.
The Roman centurion
keeping the savage horde at bay,
ensuring your seed continues.
Why would you feel shame
over what you were built to do?
To endure.
To thrive.
Because it's wrong.
No. This is not a moral compromise.
It's primal, elemental.
Magnificent.
Darwin himself would be proud.
Darwin?
I missed his treatise on genocide.
Devolution, Mr Marker, takes many forms.
Promise me Cassie and I will be safe.
That all depends.
- On what?
- You.
Found the name James William Cole
in the social security database.
Birth dates match. Father's Matthew.
There's a Matthew Cole
who owns a garage about an hour away.
Might be his dad.
- It's a lot to take in, I know.
- I'm more worried about prison.
We're going to ask a stranger
for a sample of his son's blood?
It'll be fine.
(LAUGHS) Yes, yes, the woman
who threatened me with a gun.
We won't need a gun.
Did you bring a real one this time?
You're going to kidnap this boy?
If that's what it takes.
Oh, can you...
Can you please stop the car?
(VOMITS)
Are you alright?
It's soon going to be over.
I have an appointment.
- You're pregnant?
- For now.
Recently, I was a married woman.
For six days.
Six.
Then he left me.
And now...
I want every part of him gone.
(BABY MOBILE MUSIC PLAYS)
- DR RAILLY: Excuse me?
- Yeah.
I'm looking for Matthew Cole.
Is this his garage?
Yeah.
I'm with the CDC.
I don't know if you're aware, but there
have been several cases of E coli
in the area recently,
likely from that supermarket.
We have reason to believe Mr Cole,
or his family might have been exposed.
I'm sorry, miss. Wrong guy.
You're not Matthew Cole?
No. Bill. Bill Anderson.
Mr Cole owned this place before me.
Do you know where I might find him?
Is there a forwarding address?
Disappeared.
I haven't seen him for months.
Good luck, though.
Come on.
- (CREAKING)
- Listen.
James?
Hello.
Alright, you've got two minutes.
I gotta get back.
OK, so you are Matthew Cole?
I'm not usually the paranoid type.
The boy's mother was always...
Well, let's just say that she gave me
a reason to worry about James.
DR RAILLY: Of course. Protective
parents are perfectly natural.
Dad? I can't get this to work.
- Can you...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What word was that?
I don't think I heard you right.
- I can't.
- We don't use that word around here.
- The only failure...
- Is giving up.
Exactly. Now, why don't you
work on that a little by yourself?
And then I'll come help, OK?
Good boy.
- We're not here about E coli.
- Let's have it, then.
I'm gonna tell you the truth.
Oh, God help us.
You're gonna find this hard to believe.
It's just...
Nearly impossible, I'd say.
You need to leave.
Please. I'm telling the truth.
That boy is the only thing
in this world matters to me.
I don't know what game you're playing...
No, no, no. It's not a game.
It's not a game.
- I think we should go. OK, let's go.
- Mmmmm.
It's real. All of it.
The virus, time travel.
There's something called
the Army of the 12 Monkeys and...
What did you say?
The Army of the 12 Monkeys.
They're the ones behind the plague.
- Did Marian send you?
- Who?
Marian. The boy's mother!
Last time I saw her, she was
on about some... monkey army.
Told me I had to protect him.
Your son, the grown-up James Cole,
he needs you.
Right. And who are you to him, exactly?
Look... come with us.
Look into his eyes.
If you don't see your son there,
then you can leave,
And we will not bother you again.
But... if you won't come... he'll die.
Cole?
Railly?
- There's someone here to see you.
- Huh?
James?
- Dad?
- Yeah.
JONES: Dr Adler?
Where the hell did that come from?
Have there been any power surges?
Temporal activity of any kind?
Just a small tachyon surge
in the middle of the night.
- Nothing unusual.
- I want to know how they got here.
- Is it like a shot?
- JONES: Yeah. Just like it.
Except, instead of putting
something into your body,
we're taking something out.
Will it hurt?
Nah, just a pinch.
- (CLEARS THROAT)
- Am I sick?
No. You're helping somebody who is sick.
- Your friend?
- Yes. My friend.
Wait. Dr Railly?
You'd better do this.
I'd hate to seal the fate of mankind
because I can't find the vein
of a five-year-old.
She's a really good doctor.
OK...
- Ah, ah.
- I know. I know. Almost done.
- Are we done?
- Almost.
- Owl
- DR RAILLY: Alright.
- Aah!
- Owl
Mr Cole, you have to keep
your distance from the boy.
You can't get too close to yourself...
to James.
That would be disastrous.
Come here. There. There.
There.
Good job.
Alright?
Let me get some rest.
And I'll sit with you.
I have to say, boy saved my life.
Before he came along,
I wasn't much of a man.
You...
You told me about my mother.
I... didn't know her that well, Marian.
I loved her like crazy, but...
It was a short thing.
I asked her to marry me, but...
She wouldn't.
I took off pretty soon after...
...without saying much.
When she tracked me down a year later,
she had a kid.
My son.
You.
Told me she couldn't protect you.
I never understood
what she was talking about.
But I was grateful.
Every day.
He's a... he's a good boy.
He won't always be.
But I'm trying to make up for it.
- I'm sorry... I can't...
- Hey. Don't use that word.
- The only failure...
- Is giving up.
Exactly.
- Are you alright?
- Yeah, just trying to...
I know. I know.
I'm so sorry.
You know, I just thought...
I'd be there for him... always.
- This plague, it'll get me for sure?
- (PHONE RINGING)
Excuse me.
Aaron?
AARON: Cass, come around the corner.
The parking lot. Quickly.
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah.
Cass, please don't ask a lot of
questions, just get in the car.
They're gonna win this.
They're gonna win this. You know that.
Nothing changes!
- Oh, my God, what did you do?
- Get in the car.
- They wouldn't wait any longer, OK?
- What did you do?
- Please.
- Aaron! Stop it!
We can't stop it, Cass!
You know I'm right!
Get in the car, now!
(GASPS)
- Where is he?
- A step ahead of you, asshole.
(CHUCKLES) I doubt it.
You're just in time.
Yes. It's over, Cole.
I know.
Cole?
My father...
- The boy?
- Yeah, I left him with Katarina.
I didn't want him to see.
It was Aaron.
That's how they found us.
- (SIRENS)
- We should go. Come on.
JONES: He'll be safe here
with child protective services.
You're throwing away your cigarettes?
I've decided to keep the child.
After all this,
maybe my father was right.
Love is never a mistake.
DR RAILLY: But the plague,
you might not have much time.
I'm a scientist, Dr Railly,
I don't believe in fate.
I could tell you, you know.
Who those men were, everything.
Give you a chance to do it differently,
give you a head start.
It's tempting, but no.
It's just as likely to undo your work
as it is to help mine.
The causality of temporal physics
is unpredictable.
And if it is fate
that our paths will cross again,
then we'll find the answers together.
But listen, Mr Cole,
you have to understand,
the paradox has destroyed your
ability to travel back to your time.
You live here now.
I know.
- Good bye for now, Mr Cole.
- Good bye, Katarina.
We'll probably have
some more questions for you,
but you just...
you play here for a while.
OK.
Are you sure we should leave him here?
- Maybe I could see if...
- He'll be alright.
He'll make friends.
You OK, kid?
Don't be scared. It's OK here.
I'm Jose.
I'll show you around.
ADLER: I analyzed the plant.
It is ordinary hedera helix.
English ivy.
But why is it red?
Why is it growing on my machines?
- There's barely any light here.
- Well, I have a theory.
Yeah?
I examined the isotopic CO2 composition
of the cell membrane.
I'm not a botanist, Dr Adler.
Nor am I. But based on my analysis,
this plant grew in an environment
with significantly higher amounts
of greenhouse gases.
- Meaning?
- This plant is not from our time.
(ALARM SOUNDS)
JONES: What's happened?
It's Sergeant Whitley, ma'am.
(GASPS)
Good Lord.
They're coming. They're coming.
This facility...
what is inside is very important to us.
Are you sure you can get us in?
It'll be my pleasure.
