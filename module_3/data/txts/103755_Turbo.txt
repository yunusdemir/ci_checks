Here is the future.
The world we know is gone.
Acid rain has made the ground barren <br / > and water toxic.
After endless wars -
- struggling humanity to survive
in the ruins of the ancient world.
Frozen in a eternal nuclear winter.
How is the future.
The year is 1997.

Okay...

Still unbeaten.
What else have you got hold of?
For the bras I can give you

It sucks.
Hello!
Step to your shit!
Unbelievable!
Or I might -

in these difficult times.
Your time as justice guardian
is over, Turbo Rider -
- but to be a true hero,
you must rescue your girlfriend.
Save me, Turbo Rider!

This is great!
Are you alone?
Do you have any friends?
Want to play hide and seek?
...
- I'm on now.
- Wait!
Before we go, should I just take care of something.
Now you do not worry
about me anymore.
I have found a new friend.
I'll be fine .
Sir? I...
I think -
- that it would be better
to look for water -
- instead of fighting against Zeus?
Do you think we should give up my brother?
No, but -
- do you really think that we have a chance? ' / p>
Do you think I was champion
by taking chances?
With a good plan has already
won half the battle.
- What's the plan?
- Right now?
Right now I have to piss.
Who also need luck?
What a cheap move.
Why did I know
that it would be you?
Soon you must learn to fix it yourself.
Here you go.
Good morning!
What are you doing here?
Breakfast.
Where did you get all this? ' / p>
What a lot of things!
It's like a cool museum!
Fantastic!
So many colors!
I love the color of the dress!
It is so beautiful.

Have you right?
Yes, but you -

- Oh no! </ p >
Have I ruined it?
No, -
- it's more to have
an arm's length -
- personally space.
Okay?
Now I understand.
- How did you find me?
- It is the bracelet.
Fine, but -
- how do you get it?
You can not.
Sit down and eat your breakfast,
before it becomes soft.
How can I know
that it is not poisoned?
Because friends poisons not each other.
No, we're not friends. </ p >
- I do not even know who you are.
- We met on the playground.
Yes, but you broke into my home. You...
You touched my things and you...
You are talking to dead people. </ P>
And I've Turbo Rider comic.
Okay, I thought you'd hang out -
- but if you want that I go...
Wait. You may well be,
but not for a long time. </ P>
- I called Apple.
- Of course you do so. </ P>
What are we doing today ?
I should be looking for things.
- I love to look for things.
- No, you...
...you must stay here.
Do not touch anything.
Why can not I go with you?
Because...
because you do not have a bike.
We look for things.
I love to look for things.
You were right. Your husband bubble
is really comfortable. </ P>
We need to talk. </ P>
If we have to go together,
Do you live by the rules of survival. </ P>
Okay, I love rules.
Rule number one.
Always have water on you.
Water. Quoted.
Rule number two.
Always stay in the safe zone.
- It is wise.
- Thank you.
Rule number three.
Keep your bicycle ready.
Your bike ready.
Rule number four.
Avoid people, especially the evil.
I am glad you did not escape me.
As if I had a choice.
So you Frederick, armbryderen.
You are observant, Zeus.
It is wonderful to attach a face to -
- the name and an honor to have you here.
You can stab your honor diagonally up.
What have you done with my brother?
You must have patience, my good man.
Your way to do it is too boring.
Here we do things
with more happiness.
- Knive. En fin detalje.
- Der er mere.
Knives and Fire.
When I say knives and fire,
I want knives and fire.
- Would you mind...
- No, you go right ahead.
Thanks.
Just because civilization is over,
does not mean that we...
...can not be civilized.
Should we see what the man has to offer?
Okay Zeus, but you will not
break you about it .
Do you think it surprises me?
I have eyes everywhere.
I can only see one.
I will kill you with my bare hands.
I can only see one.
- Rule. Five; No stuff on the bike.
- Sorry.
We need to find a bike for you.
And a helmet.
- Rule number five. ..
- Number six.
- Rule number six.
- Yes.
Always have a weapon on you.
And number seven, if you do not have a
so low one.
Make a.
Make a weapon.
It is so beautiful.
It is my weapon.
It is my pixie wand.
I am very pleased with it,
thank you.
Pew. Pew, pew. Right in the eye.
You are not. </ P>
No, I told you to come back. </ P>
- Relaxing never of.
- No.
- Can I ask you something?
- Yes.
What are you doing here?
I practice on my swing. </ p >
I mean, how did you get here?
- This side of the wasteland?
- My last best friend -
- was a water hunter, <br / > so I came with, but then he died.
And now I'm here.
- I'm sorry.
- Why? What have you done? </ P>
- No, I mean it with your friend.
- Do not be. </ P>
He is dead. </ P>
- Where are you from?
- Far away from.
From the other side of the wasteland.
I've always wondered how so out.
It is gray and dusty.
I could show you.
- This... I can not.
- No, usually number two.
It was too bad, because...
You are it.
- What?
- You are it. I have touched you. </ P>
Now you catch me if you can. </ P>
- See the bird.
- What? </ P>
You are quick.
Want to see something cool.
- I always want to see something cool.
- Come here.
It's a T. Rex.
It was large animals
that walked the earth for long.
They were probably killed by a big explosion,
like what happened to us.
Not...
Running. Running.
As you know, the situation is critical.
Our defense has been breached.
We have reached maximum
number of casualties.
This is the end, soldier.
We must hit the machines,
with everything what we have.
You are our last hope.
Turbo Rider.
Our future is in your hands.
Where is she?
I'm coming, Apple!
Dear followers! We've got
visit from a special guest. </ P>
Let me introduce Frederick, -
- den enarmede armbryder.
Frederick would like to retrieve
his dear brother.
I know how generous I am,
so I will grant his request.
You ask enough yourself
what this is for one thing.
Do you like science? I love it. </ P>
Do you know how much water a
average human consist of? </ P>
Your blood is made up of 83% water,
your muscles are made of 75% -
- all the cartilage around the bones
consists of 55% -
- the bones are 25% -
- and head
consists of 90% water -
- the total is 37 liters of H2O.
37 liters, this machine
can extract.
I hope you choked on it, you idiot.
Dear followers...
Who protects you?
- Zeus!
- Who turns off your thirst?
- Zeus!
- And who keep you entertained?
Zeus!
I'm not so petty, as you think.
- Start the juicer!
- No!
If there was anyone who said anything ?
Did someone say something?
Let the girl escape!
And who you supposed to be?
...is a superhero.
And what's your super power?
I asked what's your super power?!
This
Now you have to put effort into.
Well, what a disappointment.
Put him in the pool.
Down in the pool.
I'm so glad to see you!
I brought it here with you.
You are the best.
It is well enough sweet.
I am glad on your behalf, -
- but we are all in the blender,
if we do not have a plan.
Listen. I take the thick,
he is strong, but slow. </ P>
You take him the big one.
Find something. </ P>
In two takes him the ugly .
What's the matter, kid?
Are you afraid?
- Yes.
- Fear is good, use it as a weapon. </ p >
What kind of a gizmo a dwarf?
No, this is my fairy wand.
Swing it as hard as you can
against his face.
Yes, sir!
Feel Nisse Father's anger!
Can you feel it?
Daddy Gnome's mad!
It's been our signal.
You are dćlme quick.
Apple
Now you are shown not as fast, cool look.
Bravo!
I had not imagined.
We won! Let us then release. </ P>
How it works not, kid. </ P>
- you change the rules, do not you, Zeus?
- My game, my rules.
No
I admire your determination,
but you are ultimately just a loser.
- Put the kid down!
- It's real, kid.
Get ready to taste justice
turbo cannon! Right in the face. </ P>
Warning! </ P>
Now we shown them
has passed. </ P>
We divide us. </ P>
Find them. Kill them. </ P>
Come back with their
heads on spears. </ P>
Hey, sleepyhead. </ P>
Where... where are we?
- Vi sidder pĺ en sofa.
- Hvorfor? Hvordan?
You got one on goddagen.
You came back to save me.
It was very sweet of you.
- You look good in the outfit .
- Do you really?
I wish I could be like
the right Turbo Rider.
Maybe you can not, -
- but you can be Turbo Kid!
The one with the flap to the eye... It was him.
I should have stopped him,
so you were not shot.
You are...
...a robot!
You're it!
You are very human < br /> a robot to be.
I'm very high tech.
I thought all robots were evil.
It depends on the model.
Can you shoot laser beams
from his mouth?
No, fjollerik,
I'm just a friend...
Apple? Apple? Apple?
Are you okay?
Yes, my bio-electromagnetic
transmitter is damaged.
- Does it hurt?
- No, I lose only Some Hearts.
What happens
when you have no more hearts?
So I close down forever.
Closes Down? If you die then? </ P>
Yes, I die. </ P>
Jack? Look at you. </ P>
Do you not too far with
your comic look? </ P>
- You must help us.
- No. </ P>
I do not care -
- what you've gotten yourself into.
Put it back.
Have you got a girlfriend?
Give it to me.
What do you do? Travelling away?
Yes, and you should too.
Armbryderen is gone and Hell is loose.
Some fools did Zeus angry -
- and he is on a rampage.
- Yes, it was us. See here. </ P>
- Wait.
- Do not follow me. </ P>
We need a bioelectric
transmitter, otherwise she dies. </ P>
Are you crazy?
- She's a robot.
- Yes, but also my friend.
- I do not want to hear about it.
- Bagu, will not you?
Why should I help you?
What do I get out of it?
You can get it here.
Well so.
But only because it's you.
You must northwards -
- find Highway 64 and there you will find -
- robot cemetery.
There you might find it
you're looking for. If you are alive. </ P>
Other I do not know. Let me go. </ P>
Thanks. </ P>
Og Bagu,
vandet, det er mennesker.
People? This is rubbish.
Apple
Why is this fucking shit -
- always there for me.
Could it then be worse?
Hello, sleepyhead.
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
I have 7,5 hearts back.
How can you eat,
if you're a robot? ' / p>
I can eat and drink,
I can sleep and breathe.
It seems more convincing if
I behave completely like a human.
You know, no one will the recalled -
- to your best friend is a robot.
I think it's kind of cool -
- that you are a robot.
And then you fought like hell.
Should I teach you?
Yes.
Would you like to be the best
to bash?
- Yes.
- Turn first.
Turn hard. <br / > Show no mercy.
- That's it.
- Is that it?
First, turn and surprise the enemy.
Turns hard. < br /> Remember to human weaknesses.
Eyes, throat and groin.
Show no mercy.
So, without mercy.
- Thank you.
- It was great. This is fun. </ P>
I am happy...
I love looking
in the sky at night. </ P>
Do you know why is
as many stars?
Because the space consists of
dust and gases -
- which are assembled to
billion of stars and suns -
- the galaxies in the universe.
Yes... No... I mean
to my mother -
- once said that when a person dies,
as being born a star.
So when the day of judgment occurred
lit the sky up -
- all the souls of people
who died.
So your mom is up there.
Yes, with my father -
- up there in the sky.
It's weird. I never
talked to anyone about my parents before. </ P>
I'm sorry...
Do not worry. It could happen to anyone. </ P>
We'll have made you.
I promise. </ P>
T. Rex...
Where the hell am I? </ P>
Zeus! How are you? </ P>
You look nice and pretty serious. </ P>
Have you got a new coat? </ P>
No... It does not look good. ' Br /> Not at all.
No matter what it is
then we can talk about it.
Would you leave town -
- without saying goodbye?
- No, it did not occur to me.
I'd just gone a few days.
Down to the beach and get a little color.
I need vitamin D.
I am looking for a young man, a young girl
and a great smart cowboy.
A cowboy? A young man...
And a girl... Maybe...
No. Tell me nothing. </ P>
I hate to be negative, but
your insides are actually fixed -
- the wheels on this bike.
- It's...
Brilliant. Yes. Thank you. </ P>
I know that you know -
- where they are. So I suggest -
- you get mouth slipped.
- Right now.
- Robot cemetery.
They are on the robot graveyard.
Other I do not know.
Well, it went fast.
How disappointing.
Will you help me get them back?
Do you realize how long
all this has taken?
Yes, of course you know.
No
Alley!
Apple
I am sorry. We were so close.
It's all right. You are the
best friend ever. </ P>
You must not die. </ P>
So here we are. Hold on. </ P>
Apple, wake up. Wake up.
I will not be alone again. </ P>
I have traveled all day,
so I'm pretty thirsty. </ P>
Provides In mon a glass of clean water
to another traveler?
Lower hammer
will not be necessary.
I know
that my friend did not look nice out, -
- but I just need
for a glass of water.
Thanks .
Although! That I needed. </ P>
Where did the water come from? </ P>
This is my land. </ P>
It would be theft to take something
from my land, -
- and I will not steal from me, do you?
- You got your water, so be sweet to go.
- Where have water from?
Do not worry, honey, I'll make it.
Do not worry, honey, he'll make it.
Drowning Death. It is a luxury,
few men can afford. </ P>
Stop! </ P>
Now look just pranks. </ P>
Your gumption nothing wrong
but you have played your role.
So we should not forget the day today.
No
She is mine.
Stop!
What have we here?
Okay, kid, try as best you can.
Forget him.
He will not survive long out there.
You all right, kid?
You were part of that nasty gas.
Where Apple?
Sorry, kid.
- Why did you save me?
- I owed you to do.
I had actually need a new hand.
I did not fucking
expected to encounter you.
It must be fate or something.
Impressive, right?
- You know what it is?
- A Turbo Mega Blaster.
You have mastered the shit.
If you saw
where I'm going with this?
I'm meeting an old friend,
and then to Zeus.
I jam this thing so
far up the ass of him -
- that he can taste his own shit.
Are you with it, kid?
Let us Daffe.
Yes, let's Daffe. </ p >
How does he manage find me?
What are you doing?
Just keep cool, kid. Trust me .
Bold dress!
You become friends
with the wrong, Frederick.
See, armbryderen has
got a new arm.
What about you, Jack? Are you on the rampage
after the loss of your super power -
- and your girlfriend?
Or rather, robot girlfriend. </ P>
She called Apple! </ P>
Your gumption nothing wrong kid -
- but you have unfortunately
played your role.
So we should not forget the day today.
You are his boy.
You full of surprises, is not it?
Shut up and let's fight!
I guessed I wanted underway
that's why I made fun of .
Now there is free play.
Prepare for battle, boy.
This is gonna be ugly.
I do not know if I can.
A man does not know how strong he is,
until he has to be strong.
- Really?
- I do not know, but it sounded good.
Eyes! Neck! The step. </ P>
To. </ P>
The ladies...
Now I can feel the love! </ P>
Kom an, din nar.
Want more? Take it, bitch.
As well, taxes darling.
Come to daddy.
You, boy.
Rřvbanan!
Thank you die now!
- You are alive!
- You did not wait for me.
Sorry... I thought you were dead.
I would also have been
with the fight game.
I found your...
...turbo glove.
- Thank you.
- Bon appetite.
You big idiot.
Your big...
He was probably rude.
So here we are again, pure deja vu.
You were right,
it was not to forget.
What was difficult about it?
It's real, Zeus.
I like most people,
but you I do not like.
You have I gone with long enough.
This is what you get out of
trying to fit in.
- Are you a robot?
- Yes.
Did you know?
Robot?
I am a CC 1-11. Firm. </ P>
Designed to create and implement
company tactics. </ P>
Created in my master image. </ P>
He said to me -
- just before I smashed his head
with his own golf club.
Remember, you are only a robot.
Only a robot! </ p >
I am still here -
- not him.
Sir? You are very evil. </ P>
I do not expect that a simple
friendship model -
- understand what I just said. </ P>
But just quiet -
- people are -
- very inefficient.
In fact pests.
A bit like cockroaches.
- You are a monster!
- I was designed by your kind.
Has made me what I am.
It was a mistake, and I try
to correct it.
That's what superheroes do.
How charming!
Want to see what I can do?
You did well, Turbo Kid.
When you look up at the sky on night -
- I will be there.
No.
No.
You did the right thing, kid. ' / p>
- How's your shoulder it?
- It'll be fine.
This cowboy can not be killed.
Amazingly, you have found water.
It will save hundreds of lives, -
- perhaps even more.
Take care of it.
Are you sure that you want to travel?
Where do you want to go?
I want to see how the rest of
wilderness look.
There is not much to see, kid.
I know.
