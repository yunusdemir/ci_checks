We see a cruiser, stop, take out

No one needs to get hurt.
Now, these guards

They want to get hurt for $10 an hour,

When's the time lock set for?
-9:00.
Don't lie to us, it's 8:15.
Listen, it's not your money.
You understand? Don't lie to us again.
Hey, sweetheart, in the corner.
Get in the corner. You too, brother-man.
Go. Go.
No distress call. Open it clean.
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Don't stall,
This guy a fucking friend of yours?
Let's go!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Take your time, okay?
Breathe. Go.
Okay, get back. Get out of the way.
Front door.
Hello.
Front door.
Hey, you guys open?
We gotta go.
Let's go. Let's bleach it up.
Go, go, go.
Let's bleach it up.
Come on, let's go. We gotta go.
Hold it. Silent alarm, this address.
Who did it?
-Look, nobody did anything.
What? Huh? What'd you say?
Nobody did anything.
You pull the alarm?
-No. No.
Did you?
I didn't pull any alarm.
We were leaving,
you motherfucker! You fuck!
Easy, easy. That's enough.
-All right? Easy.
You fuck!
You fucker. We were out the door,
you fuck.
Let's go.
Where's your purse?
What the fuck is this?
The cops get us walled in,
we're gonna need her.
Sit down. Go.
Head for the boulevard.
You're gonna be okay.
All right? No one's gonna hurt you.
What's up?
Boosted a city work van.
Which still hasn't been reported stolen.
Probably too busy working.
Used the van to screen the door.
Bleached the entire place for DNA.
Kills all the clothing fiber,
so we can't get a match.
Silent bell
came from cage number two.
Assistant manager's at Beth Israel.
Our guys waited for the time lock
to expire...
...then they had the manager
open sesame.
Under duress?
I don't know.
Ten foot steel safe.
Only as strong
as the guy with the key.
Found the dye packs and the tracers.
Found the van, Torched.
-Where is it?
-Where do you think?
Nice to be back home, Dino?
Yeah.
It's all the love I get
makes the homecoming feel so warm.
Could be 50 people here
eyewitnessed these guys.
And 50 hands on a bible
saying they never saw nothing.
Well, it's a pro job.
All the pro guys I know are away...
...so I guess we got new pro guys.
The part of the job where
we get to do something...
...that has no point and yields no results.
Excuse me.
Anybody see who lit this van on fire?
Is that where we are now?
Where's Jem?
Stopped on the way
to light a couple house tires...
... stick up a liquor store, maybe,
I don't know.
-Are we taking hostages now?
-No, we're not taking hostages now.
-You gonna talk to this fucking asshole?
-For one thing--
Hey.
Speak of the fucking devil.
You made it.
-Take the scenic route?
-We got a problem.
-What?
-Well, look.
So what?
What's the matter?
Let me see that.
Fuck.
GLOANS; Oh, shit.
See the address on that?
-Bitch lives four blocks away.
Yeah, I know
where we are, Gloans. Fuck.
We gonna see this bitch
on the street every day?
She didn't see anything.
Jesus, are you sure?
-Taking her for a ride didn't help.
-Yeah.
Oh, fuck.
All right. I'm gonna handle it.
How you gonna handle this?
I'm gonna stalk her
like a fucking A car, we'll find out.
-Find out what?
-If she needs to get scared.
-She's already scared.
-Well, maybe not scared enough.
Thanks, Kathy.
Ms. Keesey. Special Agent Adam Frawley,
Violent Crimes and Robbery.
Derek here is gonna take some
elimination prints.
I see you've given
a preliminary statement.
I want to talk to you
about your abduction.
Okay.
-I understand they threatened you.
-Mm-hm.
One of them took my license.
And did you try to escape
at any point?
No.
Is there anything you can identify
about the men? Anything you'd testify to?
I didn't try to escape
because they had guns.
I understand.
Then they just let you go?
-Yeah. They just let me go.
Thanks.
When someone endures
an experience like this...
...there are very often
residual effects.
It's gonna be okay.
Did they say anything?
"if you talk to the FBI, we'll come
to your house and fuck you and kill you."
Are you gonna take care of it?
-I'll do it.
-Why are you gonna do it?
You're the reason
we're having this conversation.
-I'm gonna get it done.
-What are you gonna get done? Huh?
You get picked up
for intimidating a witness.
You walk within 100 feet of her,
that's 10 years. Okay?
You got two strikes against you already.
They're gonna bury you under the jail.
How much money's in the sack?
All right, we got 90 a pop.
Minus what I had to shave off
for the Florist.
Hey, Jem, what happened
with the assistant manager?
Yeah. Well, next time Skeletor comes
in the bank with an AK...
...I think he's gonna think twice
about hitting that alarm, isn't he?
He's lucky he just got tuned up.
Are you gonna catch them?
Yes.
This is the FBI.
We're not completely inept.
In fact...
...l know where they are.
Three hundred and seventy
bank robberies in Boston last year.
More per capita than
anywhere else in the world.
The guys like this, hardcore guys, pros,
90 percent of them...
...emanate from a one-square-mile
neighborhood called Charlestown.
-Familiar with it?
-You must be kidding me.
First thing B.P.D. does
when there's an armored-car robbery?
-Close the Charlestown Bridge.
And he's from Charlestown.
They use each other's yards, houses.
They're like rats.
They ditch us pretty quick.
Heisting banks is a trade in Charlestown.
The way villages in old Europe
used to be known for certain crafts.
In the town,
it's banks and armored cars.
I don't understand it, but it makes it easier
when you know which bridge to close.
Quinlan will set you up with a detail.
Meantime, if there's anything your
witness specialist can't do for you ....
You got nothing to worry about.
We're gonna find these guys.
-Hi, how you doing?
Good. How are you?
Good. Come in.
Nice to see you.
-Good to see you.
-How have you been?
-Good. Come in and have a seat.
-Thanks, Margie,
-Can I get you guys anything?
-We're tine. Thank you.
-Okay, well, Mike'll be right out.
-Terrific.
Really done well for himself.
Yeah.
He got good money
for that place in the town.
Why does anybody move to Saugus?
It's gonna take us an hour
to get over the Portagee Slide.
Yep.
Jesus.
This shit with the Florist
is getting old, man.
I'm investing in a marquee score.
All right? So we gotta
make a few payments.
Fuck making payments to him.
Hey, let me give you some advice.
Money don't care where it came from,
all right?
The guy's a fucking
Lucky Charms Irishman...
...who can't find no one
to sell his AKs to...
...so he's selling narcotics,
trying to be the boss.
You didn't seem to care
when you were dropping 2 grand a week...
...on monsters and yay, did you?
Look, there's a difference between
a dealer and a straight killer, all right?
So he dropped a few Dominicans.
What, are you picky?
Hey, guys.
-Hey, Mike.
-Hey, Mike.
-Here you go, guys.
Hey.
Here you go.
-Hundred G's?
-That's right.
Look at this.
-Like a newborn baby. All right.
-That's it.
-Take care, guys.
-All right. Good to see you, Mike.
-Looking good.
-All right.
Hundred pounds.
Hundred grand.
There you go.
Green money.
All right.
-Be smart, brother. We'll see you.
-Thanks. Thank you.
-Hey, Rusty. How you doing?
-Hey, Jem. What's up? How are you?
Fergie. Kid's here.
Hey, Fergie.
-Here you go.
-How's it going, son?
All right. You run that under the sink,
all right?
Trust me.
All right. Good to see you.
Take it easy, man. Good to see you.
Now it's time for the fun part.
What's going on, pal?
What up?
Hey, there he is.
Boom.
Sober Jackson.
What's up?
-Hey, hey. Krista's here.
Go on, tell the story.
Dougy, sit down. I'm trying to tell
these motherfuckers about your father.
The feds will never understand
the guy who's facing 40 years,
Gonna give him the opportunity
to walk soot-free if he gives up his friends.
He tells them,
"Suck a dick. Give me the 40."
"Fucking suck a dick."
Yeah, well, here's to Big Mac.
Doing his time like a man.
That's right.
Last crew in Charlestown.
I'm gonna get a tonic, I guess.
All right.
Get me an umbrella for my beer.
Let me get a Shirley Temple
with an extra cherry, please.
Poor fucking sober bastard.
-Thanks.
- No problem.
Juice?
Yeah. Juice.
Do you want some snappers
to go with that?
-What are you doing?
-I was just playing,
Fuck.
My drink.
Heard you got in a tight, Kris.
Do I look like I got in a fight?
I don't know. Let me see.
They pull your hoop out?
That's right.
The Jamaican started it.
"The Jamaican started it."
What Jamaican?
Fucking Somalian started talking shit
when I was with my daughter.
You were with Shyne?
Tonya was with us. And Cheryl too.
-The other girl was by herself?
-Yeah.
All they see are yuppies down here.
They think there's no more serious
white people in Charlestown.
So they can fucking talk shit? No.
You didn't say nothing to her first?
I said something
after I slapped the black off her face.
-Right, yeah.
-Fuck.
Well, do you miss it?
Fucking coke and Oxy
and all that shit? Yeah, I miss it.
You know what I miss?
The fucking grip I used to get
on your armrest.
We smoked it to the filter, right?
-So have one beer.
Jimmy.
-One beer ain't gonna kill you, right?
-Drink my beer for me real quick.
And one for me.
One for you? Yeah.
Dougy.
Dougy.
Doug.
Motherfucker, I know you can hear me.
You know I got a key, Dougy.
Come on in.
Too fucking busy, huh?
Come on, Dougy.
What's up, Kris?
[BREATHING HEAVILY]
There you go.
That's what you want, right?
-Yeah.
-Is that what you want?
[MOANING]
Say you love it.
Good night.
/Tn grateful to be here today.
I started out with alcohol,
and, you know, right away...
...went to cocaine and smoking crack.
Growing up in Charlestown in,
you know, a sma//-knit community...
...we took care of each other:
We were protected.
My friends were really
like my family.
Fm ashamed of the things I done
when Fm out there.
I don't know
where I learned these things.
Seven years went by,
and I'd watch Christmas, birthdays--
I didn't know what my son looked like.
Make a fast buck if we had to...
...that progressed
into getting arrested, and ....
The struggle that you have within yourself
the loss, you know what I mean?
The disappointment in yourself The anger
that turns into disappointment. The despair
It's like the guy sitting in the bar,
and a priest walks in.
The guy says, "Hey, wait a minute.
I hate to tell you this, don't waste your
time, but I happen to know there's no God."
The priest says, "Yeah, how's that?"
The guy says,
"l was an explorer in the North Pole.
I got caught in a blinding storm once.
Freezing. I was blinded.
Freezing to death. And I prayed,
'If there's a God, save me now)
Now, God didn't come."
And the priest says, you know, "How's
that? You're alive. He must've saved you."
He says, "God never showed up.
An Eskimo came along,
Took me back to his camp and saved me."
That's Janice. She's my wife
and she's sitting right there,
She's my Eskimo.
-How you doing?
Hey.
Excuse me?
Are you doing laundry?
Huh?
E just wondered if you had any change.
The machine is out.
-Can't help you. Sorry.
-Okay.
I can just hang them up
when I get home.
You all right?
I'm fine. I'm just--
Are you sure?
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine, thank you.
I'm fine, yeah.
Well, this is embarrassing.
No, you got nothing
to be embarrassed for.
Do you need help?
I'm just having a bad week.
I understand.
I like to have a good cry
at the nail salon.
[CLAIRE LAUGHS]
Just open right up to the ladies.
They're very understanding.
But, you know,
you like the Laundromat, so that's fine.
Hey, why don't you let me
buy you a drink.
Make up for letting you down
with the quarters.
You know, see if we can turn
your week around.
What's the worst that could happen?
FBI! Open the door
Open the door!
HENRY:
Fuck.
[GRUNTING AND GROANING]
Fuck.
Fucking cocksucker. Get off him.
Jesus Christ, Henry.
Oxy, guns?
It's like townie Christmas.
Minimum federal sentencing,
10 years.
[FRAWLEY WHISTLES]
You're gonna need a friend.
And she ain't it.
Great girl, though.
She really loves you, I can tell.
Good news for you is you have an alibi
for the Cambridge job.
The good news for me
is I bet you know something about it.
Everyone does trucks.
These guys beat the alarm
for the vault.
-Yeah?
HENRY: it's what I heard.
A kid, he gets into the junction box.
This is nice.
Yeah, it's a good place.
A guy I played hockey with for a long time
is one of the managers here.
Oh, yeah? That's nice.
So, what do you do for work?
Boston Sand and Gravel.
I break rocks.
Punch a ticket at the end of the day...
...slide down the back of a brontosaurus
like Fred Flintstone.
Call it a night.
[CLAIRE LAUGHS]
-Can I ask you something?
-You sure can.
I volunteer at the Boys & Girls Club
in Charlestown--
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.
As a kickball pitcher since they haven't
been able to afford any ice for the rink.
Embarrassing, City won't put
any money into that place.
Yeah, I know. Yeah, well, some of the kids
were calling me a toonie,
It just means a yuppie. Someone who's
not from Charlestown, that's all.
-Of course it does.
-They're just being punks.
-A yuppie.
-Yeah.
-So where does the word come from?
-Uh ....
It comes from back in the '90s, like...
...the toonies supplied all the tunes
to Charlestown."
...because once they moved in
the townies stole all their car stereos.
So all of a sudden,
everyone in Charlestown...
...had a Blaupunkt in their car,
you know what I mean?
Anyway.
So do your parents still live
in Charlestown?
No. My mother moved away.
My father lives out in the suburbs.
Yeah. He don't get out much.
No, I mean where did you grow up?
Marblehead.
Marblehead?
Wow.
Yeah, well,
I represent Marblehead's poor.
-Oh, really?
-Yeah, you were difined by...
...whether or not your family owned a boat.
And, well, my family didn't own a boat.
No boat. How could you
look yourself in the mirror?
It's embarrassing.
-I have a boat.
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.
-Well, you would do well in Marblehead.
Yeah, maybe. it's not my boat,
it's my friend's boat.
You should...
...let me take you for a ride sometime.
-I'd love that. Sometime.
-Yeah.
What about right now?
That's the boat. Right there.
Wow,
Not bad, right?
-Good friends to have.
Here you go.
it's the best cup I could find.
Not too much.
Thank you.
It's nice, right? I told you.
Is this where you take all the girls?
I can honestly tell you I have never taken
another girl here in my entire life.
-Oh, yeah?
-Mm-hm. That's the truth.
Hey, what do you know about
bank robbers?
-What's to know?
-You're from Charlestown.
E figured you grew up with some of them.
No, not really. I mean ....
A lot of what they say is exaggerated.
I mean, I--
When I was a kid, uh...
...we used to go to Wizard's ice cream.
It was across from J.J.'s Bar.
That was where all the big
armored-car guys hung out.
And they were like rock stars
in the neighborhood, you know?
Fancy cars. Pretty girls.
And you heard rumors
about the jobs they pulled.
The big houses they had
in Holbrook or Winthrop.
There was a lot of kids
in the ice-cream shop...
...with their noses pressed
against the glass, you know...
...who wanted to be like those guys.
[just wanted to play hockey.
Anyway, that's what I know
about bank robbers.
- Hey, Jem. How's it going?
Hey, B. Can I have a beer? Thanks.
Oh, shit.
-What up?
-How you doing?
-All right. Sox got rocked.
What's going on?
You, uh, check on that thing?
What?
The license.
-Yeah.
-And?
Nothing. it's a dead end, We're all set.
So no need to remove her
from the equation?
-What?
-You heard me.
What are you, a triggerman now?
Just loose ends, kid.
You're gonna get the fucking electric
chair brought back over to Charlestown.
Don't be so goddamned panicked,
all right, Dig Dug?
Just, you know, I don't wanna get
backdoored, that's all.
-We're fine. All right?
-All right. We're fine.
-Okay.
-We're fine.
They obviously know
how to work the box.
But I like the way they zapped the BPT
to the D-5 station.
How does one learn how to do that?
Get a job at Vericom.
-Okay.
-Thank you.
All right, let's subpoena work logs,
employee records.
Start with everybody
who lives in the town.
Go! it.
Ms. Keesey, it's Agent Frawley.
I have follow-up questions about your case.
Is there somewhere we can meet?
Why didn't you tell me
you lived in Charlestown?
It's on my paperwork.
[FRAWLEY SIGHS]
You don't like your sandwich?
It's the unfortunate nagging suspicion
you get as an FBI agent..
...who has put a lot of neighborhood
people in federal prison...
...that someone may have
violated your meal.
Come on, I don't think
anyone would do that.
They throw Tom Fitz off the roof
of Mishawum for cooperating...
...and then stand around and taunt him
while he drowned in his own blood.
So I don't think the lunch special
is out of bounds.
Okay.
They lionize criminals...
...and complain about crime...
...and I'm the bad guy.
This place is one square mile.
You walk into Lewisburg,
there's a hundred townies in there.
Well, I think I'll skip Lewisburg.
Doesn't sound like a fun second date?
If I ask a question,
will you give an honest answer?
It depends on the question.
Am I a suspect?
Would I ask you out
if I thought you were a suspect?
I don't know.
-Would you?
-Not if I wanted a conviction.
I might be seeing someone already.
-What? What is it?
-Stickup.
Chelsea Credit Union.
What would we do without Chelsea?
Anyway, aren't there rules?
Against dating the Vic?
Yeah, there's a rule.
You don't do it.
There she is.
-Hey.
All set?
-Yes,
I should have come
get your door for you, huh?
What kind of a guy lets you open
your own door like that?
What?
I have to get something out there...
...otherwise I'll be pretending
to listen to you all night...
...when really I'm thinking about
something else.
Okay.
A few days ago my bank was robbed.
Four men took it over
and opened the safe.
They took me as a hostage.
They blindfolded me
and drove me around.
And then they stopped and let me out
over at the beach and ....
And one of the guys told me...
...to walk until I felt the water
on my toes.
It was the longest walk of my life.
I kept thinking I'd step off a cliff.
And then I felt the water.
I'm sorry.
It's not your fault.
Anyway, the FBI guy told me
it would feel like I was in mourning.
FBI? You're working with the FBI?
Mm-hm.
What does that mean?
Guy comes by, checks in on you,
gives you a call? That kind of thing?
Pretty much.
They don't have any suspects?
Any clues? Any leads? Anything like that?
I don't know.
Not that they've told me.
He intimated that they were
scouring Charlestown...
...but they were wearing masks, so....
-Shit.
-Mm.
I'm sure I'd recognize their voices
if I heard them again.
I don't know,
might be harder than you think.
At least you weren't hurt.
No.
No, but David was.
My assistant manager, he was assaulted
really badly when the alarm went off.
He's been at Mass Eye and Ear
for a week.
Eye surgery.
And I still haven't been able
to go see him.
I feel like a terrible person.
Then I guess we know
where we're going.
Well, you should come in.
-Yeah?
-Yeah, you should meet him.
All right.
Hi.
-Hello. Hi.
Oh, hi. Come to my good side.
-Hi.
Look. You don't look so bad.
Really?
-Well, you know.
-Hello.
Hey.
This is my friend Doug.
-Hi. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you. I can almost see you.
So...
...they're hopeful.
Well, "hopeful" means I may recover...
...50 percent of my sight in this eye.
Oh, I just want to get back to work.
I'm gonna give you guys some privacy.
I'll be right outside.
You heard what happened?
-Huh?
Big takedown robbery.
-Fucking punks laid the guy out.
-Oh, yeah?
It's a good thing you're here.
Those guys could come back.
Yeah.
I lied to the FBI.
What?
When the guy attacked David...
...l could see the back of his neck
and he had a tattoo.
Of what?
It was one of those
Fighting Irish tattoos.
I'm afraid if I report it
they'll make me testify.
What do you think I should do?
Tell the FBI.
If the guy's got a record,
and I'm sure he does...
...they'll have his tattoos on tile.
They'll ring him up the next day.
Robbery, weapons. He'll get 30 years.
Course, they'll worry someone's
gonna come looking for the witness.
The FBI will probably want to put you in
WITSEC, you know, Witness Security.
You know, they'll probably put you
somewhere, like, you know, in Cleveland...
...or Arizona, you know,
somewhere safe.
Or...
...you could wait.
You have a card.
There's nothing says you gotta play it
right away.
You're the one who's vulnerable
in this situation right now.
The FBI are just people
like anyone else.
They wanna find the bad guy so they
can go home and nuke their supper.
You have to look out
for yourself, Claire.
Quite an expert.
Not really.
Just watch a lot of TV.
I watch a lot of CSI.
So I'm a really big expert
on all this. I know.
And Miami CSI and New York CSI.
All of them, I watch.
You'll be well-prepared.
And Bones.
Do we know each other well enough for
me to say that this truck is a little much?
It's my work truck.
If you have problems with your Prius
I can throw it in the back.
How did you know I had a Prius?
Took a guess.
I mean, it just seemed like a toonie car.
-Why, do you really have a Prius?
-Yeah.
-Really?
-I had a Prius.
-It got vandalized, of course.
-What happened?
Doesn't matter. Now I'm forced to walk
a mile through the projects.
-There were these guys and they started ....
-What?
I'm not sure if it was the same guys
who trashed my car, but--
They started getting, you know--
it started with yelling when I walked by...
...and then it got
really aggressive and ....
What were they doing?
Once glass bottles
started getting thrown...
...I started coming to terms with not being
cool enough to walk through the projects.
They threw bottles at you?
I’m fine. I just have to, you know,
go the long way.
That's all. It doesn't matter.
No. You just have to live with it,
I guess.
You remember what they look like?
I need your help.
I can't tell you what it is...
...you can never ask me about it later,
and we're gonna hurt some people.
Whose car are we gonna take?
Kenny with the white nose.
-Hey, what's good, man?
Hey.
-How you doing?
-I hope you here to buy something.
You roll up on a nigga,
"Kenny with the white nose" like that.
Well, we ain't here to play fucking Xbox.
- Yeah.
-Wanna buy some dope, Kenny.
-Cheap, shitty dope.
-Yeah? Okay.
-He sells no other kind.
-Let me go find my box.
-I'll be right back, okay?
Appreciate it.
Kenny.
We're in Charlestown.
Worst heroin problem on the East Coast.
Nigga Ken can't find his box.
You ever buy from this clown before?
I bought drugs from
electrician Marty with the white nose.
All right.
- Yeah, here we go.
I got just what you need, brother.
-All right, here.
- All right. Looks good to me, baby.
Thanks, partner.
- Yes, sir.
Hey, um...
...you know them Dominican kids
always starting trouble on Medford Street?
Know what unit they're in?
Townie credit card.
Who is it?
Open up.
What the--'?
You drinking beers up here, huh? You--
That hurts, right? Fucking piece of shit.
Huh?
Throw with your left?
Fuck!
Oh, shit, that hurts, huh?
What the fuck?
That's a bitch, ain't it?
Deal gone south for you motherfuckers.
-Too bad.
Who the fuck are you?
Shouldn't be up here
fucking selling dope, I guess.
Listen to me,
we're coming back in a week.
-If you're fucking here then...
Oh, shit.
...this is happening again.
Let's go, we're done.
Hey.
-What'd you do?
-I don't know what you're talking about.
That's my brother.
What'd you do to him?
I don't know what you're talking about.
You don't know? How about now?
No.
Hey, chill, chill, chill, man. Chill.
Chill, man.
Don't tell me to chill.
Enough. Let's go.
What'd you do?
-I don't know what you're talking about.
No?
Soccer. There goes college soccer,
motherfucker.
Fuck!
What'd you do?
-No?
I don't know. Aah!
See my face?
Go tell the cops, all right?
But just remember, I seen yours too.
Fuck.
I can't be up there
killing people, man.
Hey, you brought me.
Desmond Elden?
Yeah, works for Vericom.
Never seen the inside of a jail cell.
Most of these guys got no-show jobs.
Take down a truck...
...foreman goes, "Yeah, guy was here
yesterday." He shows us a forged timecard.
Can't play them games at Vericom
because it's a public company.
You don't show up,
it's a recorded sick day.
And Dezzy here,
he's got some interesting sick days.
BankBoston, Cummins Armored,
Arlington Brinks, Cambridge Merchants.
Jesus Christ.
So do your parents
still live in Charlestown?
No, my father finally
made it out to the suburbs,
What about your mother?
I couldn't tell you.
She left when I was 6.
What happened?
She left.
Okay.
Okay.
This sound woke me up.
At first I didn't know what it was.
Sounded like an animal
that got trapped.
I never heard a man cry before.
I came downstairs in my underwear.
I see my father in the kitchen.
First thing I remember was the ashtray.
Must have been a hundred cigarettes
in there.
Ash like a little mountain.
He stopped crying...
...was just sitting there watching TV
on a little black-and-white.
No sound.
I think he just didn't know
what else to do.
He looked at me standing there
in the doorway in my Underoos.
He said, "Your mother left.
She's not coming back."
Just like that.
Smoking cigarettes and eating
a TV dinner at 6 in the morning.
We lost our dog the year before...
...and I wanted to make these posters...
...in case my mother was lost...
...someone could call us...
...like the guy who found our dog.
To this day my father will tell you he helped
me make them posters, but he didn't.
Sat in the kitchen, drank a case of beer
while I went out on School Street...
...asking people
if they'd seen my mother.
Her name was Doris.
My grandmother had a place
that's a restaurant in Tangerine, Florida.
So I used to imagine
maybe that's where she went.
Then I came to terms with the fact
that doesn't really matter, you know?
Wherever she went,
she had a good reason to leave here.
She didn't wanna be
my mother anymore...
...and she wasn't coming back.
And now you know a little bit
about my family...
...but I'm still not showing you
my apartment.
How bad can it be?
Oh, yeah.
Desmond Elden.
Systems tech at Vericom,
22 years old.
Albert Magloan. Only in Boston
is a guy named Albert Magloan.
Mr. Magloan never met a car
he couldn't boost.
The kind of talented individual...
...that can start your Cherokee for you
while you’re still looking for your keys.
James Coughlin. Father was killed
in prison, mother died of HIV.
Shot Brendan Leahey by the cemetery
behind Mishawum when he was 18.
Pled it out. When the judge asked him why
he did it, he said, "l didn't like the kid."
Served nine years for manslaughter.
These guys plan and execute
with sophistication and discipline.
And that is not our boy Coughlin.
We think the architect is this guy,
Coughlin's best friend, Doug MacRay.
Lives in the same house,
dated Coughlin's sister...
...who most likely mules for the Florist,
who used to employ MacRay's father.
You need a fucking Venn diagram
for these people.
Mac Sr. got life for the Nashua job,
which most of you should remember.
Hijacked a bread truck
up to New Hampshire...
...one of the guards saw his face...
...so they executed both of them
with their own weapons.
Big Mads legacy is now no A car driver
is allowed to leave the cab...
...even if there's a gun
to his partner's head.
MacRay did eight months
for going over the counter at a BayBank...
...with a nail gun
after he washed out from pro hockey.
-Pro hockey?
Yeah, he was a big deal for a minute.
Got drafted, went to camp,
and here's the shocker:
Started making trouble,
fighting with guys.
-Don't they pay you to tight in hockey?
-No, not the guys on your own team.
MacRay came home,
got into the family business.
Same song, got into OxyContin.
Hockey ship sailed with the narcotics.
Now, we are a long way away
from a grand jury here.
We'll never get 24-hour surveillance...
...unless one of these idiots converts
to Islam.
So we build the case.
All right, let's get to work.
So I've been telling all my friends
about you.
-Oh, yeah? All good, I hope.
-Yeah.
Eh.
Oh, yeah.
They say they're overcome with jealousy.
They can't believe your luck.
You moved to Charlestown,
hooked up with a rock-breaking townie.
No.
They just think it's a rebound.
A rebound from what, the robbery?
I don't know.
I feel estranged from them somehow.
What? Why do you look like that?
-My brother died on a day like this.
-When was this?
He was little. He had lymphoma.
So now on really sunny days
I always think of someone dying.
That's wrong, isn't it?
No.
I'm sure he'd be glad
you're thinking about him.
This is a good day.
I'm having a good time.
Good.
Then you'll miss me while I'm gone.
Money, bitch.
Pop.
What the fuck you doing here? Huh?
Nothing.
-Nothing? What's this?
-Who are you here with, huh?
-No one.
-Let's get out of here,
You're telling me this is yours?
-Yeah.
-Yeah? Fucking Hawaiian pizza?
-Sit down.
-Let's hit the road.
-I gotta go.
-Sit the fuck down. Just sit down.
-Hi.
-Hi.
-Hey.
-Claire.
-I'm Jem.
-Jim?
Jem. Jem. it's just Jem, yeah.
I'm a friend of this loser right here.
-Nice to meet you.
-Sit down, sit down, relax. All right?
So I saw your fucking Avalanche
parked around the corner, so ....
The Avalanche?
-Truck.
-Fucking truck. His work truck right there.
-Dougy's quite the worker.
-Yeah.
Have you two known each other
a longtime or.,.?
Since we were 6.
We're like brothers. Right?
But he's never mentioned a word
about you.
The secrets with this one, you know, huh?
[JEM LAUGHS]
Did you say your name was Jim
or Jem?
It's Ji-- Je--
Well, it's both, actually.
Teachers, when we were growing up,
used to always say:
"Hey, you can have this one.
He's a real gem."
So I guess it kind of stuck.
Whatever. I don't know.
So, what do you do
for yourself there, Claire?
Oh, I work at a bank.
I'm a bank manager.
You're a bank manager?
Sounds fun. What bank?
Cambridge Merchants. Just over there.
Cambridge Merchants. Wait, that's the one
that just got robbed, isn't it?
It got robbed, yeah. It did, yeah.
I read about that. it's crazy.
So then how is it that you two met?
Um ....
We met at a Laundromat.
Okay.
Love among the bleach, right?
Hey, it happens more than you think.
Hey, Claire, don't get too used
to your life of leisure here.
Dougy here, he's a real workaholic,
you know.
He's always taking his work home
with him.
Aren't you?
-All right.
All right, brother.
Take care of yourself, all right?
Be good.
I'll see you at home.
It was nice to meet you.
You too.
Well, I guess you haven't been telling
all your friends about me.
Who you following, Jem?
Me or her?
I told you, I made the Avalanche.
Nothing to worry about.
it's all under control.
Oh, so you're trying to get us
jammed up?
-Is that it?
-I'm trying to get you jammed up.
Tell me you got a move here, Dougy.
Because the only way I see it is you
got sprung like a goddamn bear trap...
...on some toonie pussy who happens
to be the one goddamn person-- Fuck!
The one person that can give us
to the fucking feds.
Calm down, all right?
Don't you think we need to be smart
right now?
-Smart?
-Yeah.
Let's start fucking all the witnesses.
All right?
Yeah, I'm blowing the assistant manager.
Am I smart now? Huh?
And no, I didn't tell the other guys,
only because they'd flip the fuck out.
And I want them fucking ready
for the next thing.
I told you, the next fucking thing's
not ready.
Then make it ready.
I don't like the guards
on the next thing, all right?
One kid is like fucking G.l. Joe.
He wears the vest on the outside, tucks
his pants into his fucking combat boots.
The truck's fucking waist-high.
We'll End another truck
with a driver...
...who's a fucking fat kid
with his fucking shit untucked...
-...who don't think he's Special Forces.
-Yeah?
All right, look, I know you're
happy in Fuck City over there...
...but I waited nine years in Walpole
for you, motherfucker.
Just nine years, that's all.
I'm done waiting.
This is the last one.
We're hitting pause after this.
You hate prison
but you can't wait to get caught.
We get pinched,
remember whose idea this was, okay?
Be ready on Friday.
MAN [OVER SPEAKER]:
Visitors, straight ahead.
-Who you seeing?
-Stephen MacRay.
Twelve.
-Right down there.
-Thanks, Lenny.
You all right? Every time I come up
here now it's the red pajamas.
You still getting in trouble, Dad?
Hey, you know how it is.
Can't take no shit.
You're getting a little old
for that bullshit, aren't you?
Fucking Southie kids.
They wanna run everything.
Listen, you put a year together of
good behavior and get your points down...
...you get classed out
over to Norfolk, Dad.
No one's gonna bother you there.
Nobody tights, you know?
They got fucking Ben & Jerry's
ice cream and shit.
Well, some things you gotta deal with
yourself, you know?
All right.
I'm thinking about taking a trip.
-Going dark for a minute.
-Taking heat?
Nah, just making a change.
Yeah, don't tell me.
"Making a change."
Either you got heat or you don't.
I heard a bread truck got dropped.
Oh, yeah? I didn't hear about it.
Okay.
You got five minutes. Five minutes.
Let me ask you something.
In case I don't see you again.
How come you never...?
How come you never looked for her?
Uh ....
Looked for who?
For Ma.
For my mother.
How come you never looked for her?
How come you never tried to call nobody
or look for her, or ask around?
Look, when your mother left...
...you cried so hard you were throwing up.
All over the parlor.
So I told you if you looked around
you might End her.
Just to give you an activity.
I didn't think you'd carry it
like a fucking disease.
What, you wanna think
she was an angel?
Go ahead.
But look out your front door.
How many 22-year-old girls
are out there...
...they're fucking around
with kids they don't want...
...and, you know,
no sense in their heads.
And your mother wasn't no different.
That's the hard truth.
I made my peace with it.
You make yours.
I didn't look for her
because there was nothing to ind.
Look, I gotta die five times
before I get out of here...
...but I'll see you again.
This side or the other.
So I saw your picture yesterday.
-Are you sure it was me?
-Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
-Oh, the Boys & Girls Club?
-Yeah.
It was under a "local heroes" banner.
Yeah. They got a real low standard
for who qualities on that.
Apparently you were drafted.
Yeah. I was slow.
And I couldn't skate backwards.
You're supposed to be able to skate
backwards in pro hockey.
But I could shoot, you know?
I could hit anything with a hockey puck.
But I got drafted and I just didn't do
what it took to make the team.
And when I got a second chance,
I blew that too.
They sent me home and that was it.
I look at that picture
and I see a 20-year-old kid...
...who thinks he's, you know,
got it all figured out.
Right before he's about
to throw it all away.
Hey, I don't wanna rush anything,
but can we go into your room?
Because my uncle the bus driver
lives right across the way...
...and he can see
right into this apartment.
-Yes.
-Okay.
They win the game
in overtime. Then you #flip it oven
Then you go back to Fenway Park.
Then you get another great ending
to another ....
--19, we walked through.
Nothing appears disturbed.
In this apartment anyway.
Where the fuck's the truck?
We shut and locked the door burn..
-What happened to 8:45?
-Late is what happened.
Fucking douche bag.
Say your prayers. Here we go.
Here we go.
Gun!
Don't move!
Go! Go!
Get back! Get back!
Get out of the way!
Any units In the area, 10-61 In progress.
The call went out!
Fuck.
Get out here, asshole,
I got your friend.
Calm down. Put your gun away,
all right? You're gonna get hurt.
Put that fucking gun down now.
I got you, motherfucker.
Jesus!
You should have stayed in the truck, cunt.
Let's go!
What the fuck just happened?
Goddamn it, I fucking told you.
Fucking shut the fuck up, all right?
Fucking knew it.
Goddamn it!
All right, drive. Just take it easy, all
right? Take it easy. Drive slow. Drive normal.
-Shit.
Ah, fuck.
They must have been around the corner.
Driver, turn your engine off.
Hands where I can see them.
Fuck.
Shut the engine off now.
Put your hands in the a--
Hit the engine block!
Go, go, go, go, go!
Go to the fucking switch!
Fuck!
How do you like that, motherfucker?
Let's go, let's go!
it's Dez.
Let's go, let's go!
Drop it!
Let's go!
Dino.
What?
Close the bridge.
-What?
-Close the fucking bridge.
WOMAN [OVER RADIO;
Alpha 101, Alpha 412, Alpha 407...
.Hen route to the north end
of the bridge.
They're going for the bridge.
Now, that's how you drive
a fucking car.
All the DNA in Charlestown.
The fuck was that?
He didn't wanna end up on the wall
at the VFW.
You print the inside of the van?
Frawl, the inside of the van
is a volcano.
Just find something and make it look
like something that looks like a print.
We don't have enough
for a conviction. Fine.
But I need to get them in a room.
Right now, they are burning the money
bands at some bullshit safe house.
All their alibis were paid for
a week in advance,
We're not gonna pull any DNA
off of this or off the switch car.
And that, as they say, is that.
This is the "not fucking around" crew.
Find me something that looks like a print...
...so I can grab one of these assholes
and shake their tree.
This "not fucking around" thing
is about to go both ways.
Turn around for me, will you?
-Mr. Coughlin.
-Lawyer.
-This is it? Just say what's here?
-Yeah, go ahead. Read what's on the paper.
All right.
"You aren't supposed to come out of
the truck. You got him but who got me?
Courier, you're gonna get hurt."
it's kind of short.
Go ahead, read what's on the page.
Right there? Um ....
"You aren't supposed
to come out of the truck."
-Come on, come on.
-"You got him but who got me?"
"Come here, get on the ground,
before I pop your fucking teeth out!"
Come on, read it. Read it all.
There's about five things there.
Uh ....
What is it with you guys
in Charlestown?
Don't they teach you how to read?
There's things here. Read them.
I don't wanna read that.
This doesn't sound right.
I'm not asking you, I'm telling you.
Read the pages, please.
I'm trying to make this
sound authenticious.
-You got it all fucked up.
-Authen-what?
Thanks.
-Hey, Dougy, How are you?
Oh.
How you doing?
Local crime fighter.
What's happening, Dino?
I know your father.
Yeah. Me too.
Got a few years left on his bid.
Yeah, one or two.
I hear they got to the old guy.
Split him up the back.
Fucking animals.
You'd think they'd go after
a younger kid.
I don't know.
Making a statement, I guess.
Townie crews ain't
what they used to be.
Dorchester...
...Sou!hie...
...looking to make a move.
Maybe you can change all that
when you get up there.
Let me ask you a question.
What do you call a guy...
...who grows up with a group of people,
gets to know their secrets...
...because they trust him,
and then turns around...
...and use those secrets against them,
put those people in prison?
You'd call him a rat, right?
You know what I call him?
Dino the dago.
Those people made you
a part of that community.
What did they get for it?
Inside of the fucking can.
You know we lifted a print
off the van? Right?
Special Agent Frawley...
"Douglas MacRay.
You and your boys didn't just...
[IN TOWNIE ACCENT] ...roll a Star Market
over in Malden for a box of quarters.
No, you decided to bang it out...
...in the North End at 9:00 in the morning.
With assault rifles.
You fucking dummies shot a guard.
Now you're like a half-off sale
at Big and Tall, Every cop is in line.
Fortunately, though, for you...
...this guard,
who is two-thirds to a retard...
...has miraculously clung to life.
Now, if it were up to me...
...and they gave me two minutes
and a wet towel...
...l would personally asphyxiate
this half-wit...
...so we could string you up
on a federal M1..,
...and end this story
with a bag on your head...
...and a paralyzing agent
running through your veins.
This isn't fucking townie hopscotch
anymore, Doug.
But I did want to say one thing.
Just so we're both very, very clear.
Because in these situations,
sometimes, you know...
...various parties will bandy about
the possibility of sentence reduction...
...for cooperation
or otherwise assisting the--
Assisting the prosecution.
Not this time.
You're here today
so I could personally tell you...
...that you are going to die
in federal prison.
And so are all your friends.
No deal.
No compromise.
And when that day comes...
...when you start trying to be
my hero collaborator so hard...
...that I have to slap you to shut up--
And it will come...
...despite your pitiable,
misguided, Irish omerta.
--when your code of silence
finally gives way...
...to fear of trafficking in cigarettes
to prevent sexual enslavement...
...I just want you to know that it's gonna
be me who tells you to go fuck yourself.
Hey, next time you guys
wanna take pictures of me, just call ahead.
You know, we can do better
than a barbeque.
A calendar shoot. You know?
Maybe topless, Lubed up.
Whatever you guys are into.
FBI car antennas
are half-inch matte black...
...about three-quarters the way down
the rear windshield.
Stacie are pigtailed...
...B.P.D., half and half.
Every peewee in the town knows
what an FBI rear antenna looks like.
So, in the future, if you guys
are gonna try to be slick...
...be slicker than a 6-year-old.
I gotta get back to work.
Can I go?
Good luck with that print.
Good morning, Cambridge Savings.
Claire Keesey, please.
She's the manager.
Oh, she's no longer working here.
-Since when?
-Friday.
Just get the warrant. Land, cell, e-mail,
fax, Skype. The whole fucking thing.
Oh, my God, Doug,
Took me forever trying to pick it out.
Yeah, it's beautiful.
-Is that all right?
Yeah, but I can't accept that from you.
I can't take that,
Why not? You can hawk it.
I'm not taking it back.
No. I mean, you can't--
Keep it. Come on, sit down. Sit down.
-Sit down.
-Okay.
Wow.
I quit my job today.
What?
What are you gonna do?
Uh, I don't know. Volunteer full-time.
Maybe go back to teaching.
I have a little cushion.
You know...
...people get up every day,
they do the same thing.
They tell themself they're gonna
change their life one day and they never do.
I'm gonna change mine.
Why don't you do it with me?
Go somewhere.
I got a little sofa put away.
Give it a shot.
Well, where would we go?
Wherever you want. I don't know.
See what we got there.
Doesn't have to be a big thing, you know?
I thought about going down to...
...see if my grandma's place is still there.
Tangerine, Florida.
But I'll go to any town
named after a food.
Grapefruit, Michigan.
Watermelon, New Mexico.
Just pick it on a map.
You ever read that paper The Town?
-The free paper? Yeah.
-Uh-huh,
I was clearing my foyer the other day...
...and there was a picture of the guys
who were harassing me in the bricks.
-Yeah?
-Mm-hm.
It was an article
about how one of them got shot.
-Say who did it?
-No.
Local gangsters, apparently.
I guess that's what you get
for being out on the street dealing drugs.
What makes you say
they were dealing drugs?
I grew up out there, Claire.
Believe me, that kid was selling drugs.
What do you want me to say?
I feel bad the kid who was terrorizing you
ran into the wrong guys?
Believe me, I don't.
You know, I care about you.
I don't wanna see you get hurt.
You don't go after women.
He hurt you, someone hurt him.
Too bad. That's the way it goes.
You know? That's karma.
I don't think karma works like that.
Well, however it works,
it worked out bad for them kids, you know?
And I'm not gonna shed a tear over it.
Let's go get some food, okay?
Frawl.
What is it?
Phone conversation between Claire Keesey
and a burner cell about an hour ago.
See if you can recognize the voice.
Hey, can I come over?
I want to talk to you.
Yeah. Where have you been?
Sorry, I got held up.
Fm coming over from my place.
Will you come down the back
and let me in?
Hadn't realized you'd left
your job at the bank.
Uh .... Oh, yeah. Yeah. Last week.
I'm sorry,
was I supposed to notify someone?
Fancy.
Yeah. It was a gift.
Look, I think maybe you should go.
We have our suspects.
I came by to share this with you.
James Coughlin.
Albert Magloan.
Desmond Elden.
Part of a crew that we tied
into the bankjob at North End...
...and at least three other
armored car robberies.
Look familiar?
You opened the safe for him.
He left you unharmed...
...and now the two of you are carrying on a
relationship about which you lied to the FBI.
I was wrong.
You do need a lawyer.
Something wrong with the apartment?
No, Florist.
Florist? What?
Came through.
-Oh, Jesus Christ.
-it's large, Dougy.
-it's large.
-We're smoked. Punt it.
-Who else is gonna buy it?
-You should've thought about that...
...before you kept breaking the guy off
for 40 dimes.
-There's an expectation for me.
-I'll correct it.
-Oh, you will? Okay.
-Yeah. Look.
Look, pick up an extra guy. All right?
Or go with three guys.
Or fucking be smart and boot it.
Oh, so you're not going?
No.
And why's that?
Because we got a ton of heat on us,
for one thing.
We'll put a move on.
We've done it a hundred times.
You know what? Forget it.
Do what you want to do. I'm done.
-What? What?
-I'm done.
-You're done?
-What does it sound like?
-I don't know. What's that mean?
-What you think it means?
What does that mean?
Sounds like a bunch of bullshit.
Let me put it to you this way: I'm putting
this whole fucking town in my rear-view.
There's people I can't let you
walk away from.
What?
Who?
Come on.
Are you serious, Jimmy?
She's not my kid.
I mean, come the f-- Cut it out.
All you give a fuck about
is coke and Xbox...
...now you're trying to play it off
like you care about Shyne?
Know what your problem is?
You think you're better than people.
Mr. Fucking-Clean.
Mr. Fucking-Goddamn-High-and-Mighty.
I'm better than all these people.
I'm better than everybody.
But you grew up right here.
Same rules that I did.
Okay.
What else?
Who the fuck's the father?
-I know I'm not.
-You were the one fucking her.
Yeah, I wasn't the only one, brother.
Okay? She knew
l knew I'm not the father...
...and I have enough respect for her
not to ask her.
Because I don't think she knows.
I don't wanna shatter
your illusions here, partner.
There aren't enough free clinics
in Mattapan...
...to ind out who the father
of that kid is.
I don't know who the fuck
you think you are either.
You aren't letting me
or not letting me do shit, all right?
Here's a little cheat sheet for you.
It's never gonna be me and you
and your sister and Shyne...
...fucking playing house up there.
All right? You got it?
Get that in your fucking head!
I'm tired of your one-way
fucking bullshit.
If you wanna see me again,
come down and visit me in Florida.
Cunt.
In the 302...
...feds have me dropping Brendan
right here.
I got him back on Tibbetts.
Shot him right in the chest.
I remember he looked at me.
I don't know who was more fucking
surprised he wasn't dead, him or me.
We just kind of stood there...
...for a second, like, waiting for some
shit to happen. I don't know what.
He started running.
Fucking guy ran 100 yards
with a bullet in his heart, Dougy.
I mean, the fucking guy should've ran track.
You know what I'm saying?
I didn't ask you to do that.
Yeah, well, you didn't have to, Dougy.
Come on.
They told me Brendan was coming down
here to roll up on you with a Glock 21,
So I came over here,
and I put him in the fucking ground.
Did nine years for it.
Now, you don't gotta thank me...
...but you're not walking away.
I'm grateful for everything you done
for me.
Your family took me in
when my father went away.
You're like a brother to me.
But I'm leaving.
Gonna shoot me?
Go ahead.
But you're gonna have to shoot me
in the back.
-Don't get up.
-All right.
How you doing, Fergie?
Listen, just wanted to stop by
and tell you myself...
...whatever this thing is you got
going on...
...I think my guys can handle it
without me. You know what I mean?
I wouldn't hire them without you.
And I wouldn't hire you without them.
You're a unit.
Look, with all due respect,
I didn't come here for a debate.
I'm not doing it.
So, you know, work it out
however you can. I ....
Calm down. Okay?
It goes against
my better judgment...
...but just out of respect,
smooth things over...
...just take this for it, all right?
Not gonna cut it.
Do you think I'm gonna put
Joe Flipperhead on this?
You're gonna do what I ask.
Not gonna cut it, huh?
Okay.
Let me ask you something.
Who the fuck do you think you are?
The only guy in Charlestown
with a gun?
You guys run numbers and pump dope.
You're an old guy who don't know
his glory years are behind him.
I ain't fucking working for you.
Got it?
You got a problem with that, I live at
551 Bunker Hill Street. Stop by anytime.
You know where to find me.
You're gonna do this for me...
...or I'm gonna clip your nuts...
...like I clipped your daddy's.
Don't talk about my father.
Son, I knew your daddy.
He worked for me for years. Years.
Then he wanted his own thing.
You play the horses?
You know, they either geld a horse
with a knife...
...or with the chemicals.
When your daddy said no to me...
...l did him the chemical way.
Gave your mother a taste.
Put the hook into her.
She doped up good and proper.
Hung herself with a wire
on Melnea Cass.
And you? Running around
the neighborhood, looking for her.
Your daddy didn't have the heart
to tell his son...
...that he was looking for a suicide doper
who was never coming home.
If there's a heaven, son,
she ain't in it.
Oh.
I hear you got a nice,
sweet new girlfriend.
Lives on the park.
I don't want to send her
funeral arrangement to your house...
...but I will if I have to.
Now I know where to ind you.
Claire.
Claire?
-Hey.
-Get out.
You okay?
-Get out.
-Hold on one second.
I have this on 911.
All right, you need to give me a chance
to explain myself first. Okay?
No. You had a chance.
Who talked to you?
The FBI, Doug.
You have to listen to me.
You have to let me explain this.
You understand?
-There's a lot going on here, Claire--
-No, you go to fucking hell!
-Fucking hell.
-All right, all right.
All right. All right.
Easy, now.
Why did you do this to me?
Claire, I'm sorry. Okay?
I was gonna tell you.
I came over here that night to tell you.
What, the night you fucked me?
ls that your thing?
It's not enough to terrorize someone,
you have to fuck them too?
-Listen to me. Calm down, okay?
-No. No. Get out. Get out!
You don't ever let me see you again.
Never, never.
I'm taking off for a while.
Are you taking heat?
Well, when are you coming back?
You know about this thing for Fergie
Jem wants me to do?
Yeah.
Tell him I say yes for me, will you?
Yeah.
All right.
I'm in.
But if anything happens to her...
...if I think anything
might happen to her...
...I'm coming back here.
And I'm gonna kill both of you
in your own shop.
Hey, Claire?
I just wanna talk to you,
just for two minutes. Okay?
Come on.
Claire, I would never hurt you.
I don't know what you would--
Don't fucking touch me.
All right.
I'm sorry.
Just listen to me for a second,
all right?
I will never lie to you again.
-Really?
-Yes, I promise you.
Ask me anything you want.
I'll tell you the truth,
-Why? I won't believe you.
-Yes, you will.
Why?
Because you'll fucking hate
the answers.
-You knew I was the manager in the bank?
-Yup.
-Were you following me?
-Yes.
How many banks have you robbed?
Six trucks, two banks.
Have you ever killed anyone?
No.
Think about it.
All right?
I will never lie to you,
I will never hurt you...
...and if I lose you, I will
regret that for the rest of my life.
Just wait for me.
You know, it's funny.
loan see your daddies' faces in you.
All of youse.
Reminds me I'm still in the ring.
Still taking the punches.
Still ahead on points.
Now, I have a fellow
on the inside there.
He likes to play the ponies.
Has a gambling sickness.
He couldn't pick a horse
to save his fucking life.
But courtesy of this sick man...
...l have this, Hm?
Well, the gang's all here.
There's always a weak spot.
We just need to find it.
The cash is brought out and stacked
15 minutes before the van does the pickup.
That is when you hit.
And Monday morning,
after a four-game stand with New York...
...60,000 beers, food, merchandise,
total haul:
Three and a half million.
Taking down the cathedral of Boston.
Priceless.
How long you think it's gonna take Rusty
to dump the inside man...
...when this thing's over?
Well, he should have picked
better horses.
This is gonna be a motherfucker.
You know that, right?
Well, if they were easy, kid,
everybody would do them.
Lined into right Held.
A base hit. Youkilis is headed for third base.
Hey, Bobby. Yeah, three Buds.
Seem to be having a bit
of a staring contest over there.
What can I say?
Boys like me.
I bet they do.
I was at a bar one night, right?
There was this guy there
going around to all the ladies...
...and telling them that he was
judging a hugging contest.
Some of them actually bought it, right?
So he throws his arms around them,
rubs their back, grabs their ass.
Charming.
Finally I get sick of it
and I go up to this guy...
...and I tell him that I am judging
a face-punching contest.
Oh. I'd have punched him myself.
By the way, I'm here tonight
judging a fucking contest.
What are you doing down here?
Slumming?
I work for the FBI.
Me too.
Well, you must be new.
You're all right.
It doesn't mean
you're getting fucked, though.
You gotta chase the rabbit
if you want the tail.
My mom taught me that.
You used to hang around
with Doug MacRay a little bit, huh?
How do you know Dougy?
We sort of work together.
Sand and Gravel?
No. No, no.
You a pretty decent judge of size?
Depends.
Size of what?
How big would you say that is?
Six inches?
Over or under?
Under.
Wrong.
6.14 inches exactly.
I know everything there is to know
about money.
Thickness: .0043 inches.
Weight: about one gram.
Which is interesting...
...because that means that this $20 bill
isn't even worth its own weight...
...in Oxy.
So how does it work?
Bartender gets a call...
...you pick up a package at point A,
deliver it to point B...
...the Florist gives you C?
You're thinking of running out on me.
It's not that simple.
Because, you see...
...l start waving this around
in here...
...bad for you.
I want a lawyer.
Good. Get one.
I mean, it's all about protecting
yourself, right?
Not even yourself. Your daughter.
Don't talk about my daughter.
How long were you with MacRay?
Au my me.
In all those years
that you were together...
...how many diamond necklaces
did he give you?
AH right, he-re's the deal.
Looks like we're pretty dialed in.
Dez took the van home
over the weekend...
...so that should work.
He"s meeting bug eyes at the plant
on Monday.
Krista booked the rooms, set up the outfits,
and made the New Hampshire run.
That's what I got, How you looking?
All right, the tools are set.
Got our body armor.
You know, this thing goes right...
...could be your turn
to step away too.
Yeah. Sure.
What am I gonna do, Dougy, huh?
Go down to Margaritaville, drink me
half a yard and fall off fucking bar stools?
Do me a favor.
The weight of this thing...
...pack a parachute at least.
You know the funniest thing
about being in prison?
Guys pretending
that they wanna get out.
Fuck.
You ever hear the old-timers
call a guy a "50-pound horse"?
"Fifty-pound horse"? No.
All right. Ahem.
A guy's walking with two horses, right?
One horse is carrying a hundred pounds,
the other one's got 50.
Now, the hundred-pound horse falls over
dead. So the guy's like, "What the fuck?"
Takes the hundred-pound sack,
puts it on the 50-pound horse.
Then that 50-pound horse,
he won't move,
He won't take one step
with another pound on his back.
That's me.
This is all I know.
I can't do any more time, Dougy.
So if we get jammed up...
...we're holding court on the street.
All right?
Mule.
What's that?
The story the old-timers tell...
...it ain't a horse.
It's a 50-pound mule.
See you out there.
What time did he get here?
Six a.m. according to the GPS
we have on his truck.
So we alerted you.
Pop the door, kick their nuts in.
We should wait for them
to commit a crime, don't you think, Dino?
No switch car.
Ran a cue hot on the parking lot.
That Cherokee is boosted.
Call SWAT now.
FBI! Open the door!
- FBI!
- Open the door! Open it!
Open the door! Open it!
FBI! FBI!
You brought the whole fucking
cavalry for me?
I'm unarmed, you motherfuckers.
Fuck are you doing here, Kris?
I need to talk to you.
Not a great time, hon.
-I know,
-You know?
Okay. Well, what do you want?
Here you go.
Dez told me you were here.
I wanna see you before you go.
Kris, you could do 30 years
for walking in the door.
Okay? Do you understand that?
For being here.
You can't be bringing your kid
in here, you got it? You can't stay.
I don't wanna stay,
I wanna go with you.
-I wanna change too, Dougy.
-Christ.
Why the fuck can't I change?
I could be a different person.
Jesus Christ.
You tell me what you want me to do.
I'll be whoever you want me to be,
I'm leaving with somebody else.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Why isn't she here then?
Come on.
What do you want me to tell you?
She's going away with you,
why isn't she here?
Where is she? She's no! here.
-Such a trashy little fuck pad.
-Take it easy.
After a Tiffany necklace,
I thought a room at the Ritz.
Huh?
What'd you say?
Where did you hear that?
Where'd you hear about a necklace?
A little bird.
Fucking smartass. Who told you that?
Who told you about a necklace?
I know you'd rather see a rope
around my neck!
You're getting the fuck out of here.
Let's go.
Come here, honey.
I know, it's gonna be okay. it's all right.
We're coming with you.
-You're getting out of here.
Dougy, we're fucking coming with you.
it's time to go, Okay? Here we go.
Time to go, sweetheart, Okay?
-I'm not leaving here.
-Let's go.
-I'm not fucking leaving.
-Take the kid home.
Get the fuck off me!
I can walk myself.
Don't you say no to me!
Take this.
Hey.
Will you quit fucking doing that?
You're making me nervous.
Yeah, we got a DWI over here, one car.
Coughlin, Kristina.
She had a kid with her.
The mother's at Mass General.
She wanted me to call you.
All right, yeah. I'll be right there.
Officer.
Yeah. Let's go.
Down here.
There's the door.
And remember,
you never fucking saw me.
Okay.
Dr. Forrest, dial 112, please.
Du Forrest, please dial 112.
Here he is, Mr. Six-Inches.
What happened?
You're a crimestopper,
figure it the fuck out.
Sweetheart.
I know you have oxycodone,
cocaine and alcohol in your system.
I know that you have five cars
registered in your name.
And I know right now, your daughter
is sitting in the back of a state van...
...driven to
the Department of Social Services.
So how long you wanna do this?
I'm a person, you know?
A person
who's gonna need a plea agreement...
...if you ever want to see your kid again.
Why is it always I'm the one
who's getting used?
What do you have?
Knowing just that...
...Dougy's going away after.
Wait, what after? After what?
Krista, I need you to be smart here.
This could be a big moment for Shyne.
Make a huge difference in her life.
We can help you, sweetheart.
- You there?
- Fm here.
-All set.
Okay. Go ahead.
All set.
Who called 911?
You the guys who called 911?
No one from here called.
Nah, we didn't-- It wasn't us.
We got a 911 call.
Robbery, guys. Come on.
You said a robbery?
Yeah.
A call saying you're being held up.
-Let me call Mike.
We just walked past Mike.
He let us in.
Hey, look, guys, We got a distress call.
All right?
-So who made the call?
-Nobody called from here.
No one called? What are we doing here?
-Hold on. Where's Mike?
-I just told you where Mike was.
You boys see all right?
-Huh? You fucking smartass.
-Listen. Listen.
For our safety, for everyone's safety,
we need to see your IDs.
Guys, hold up.
We been here all morning, Take it easy.
My partner asked for your ID.
All right? We don't know you.
Till we identify all the parties involved here,
we're gonna need some IDs...
...we need to see
everyone on the ground. Right now.
Whoa, whoa.
-Get your hand off your weapon.
Hey, relax.
Get on the ground!
Get on the fucking ground.
Hands behind your back.
Face down.
Behind your back. Come on.
Get your hands behind your back.
Hands behind your back. Let's go.
Take it easy.
-Fuck.
In the cash room.
Arnold Washton.
You live at 311 Hazer Street in Quincy...
...with a wife named Linda
and three small dogs.
Do not make a distress call.
Also in the cash room:
Morton Previtt.
You live at 27 Counting Lane, Randolph.
Wife, also Linda.
Morton, the Lindas
want you to open this door.
We have men outside your homes.
Back up. Back up.
You think you're gonna get out of here?
I got friends that are guards at Walpole.
They'll make your lives hell.
Well, don't you worry about it,
old-timer.
No one's going to prison.
Ten more.
Right away.
Picking up.
--least from the fan base
when the Red Sox win.
When the Red Sox win in extra innings
and everybody can go home happy...
...and they're singing 'Dirty Water"--
-How you doing?
-Fucking beautiful.
Come on.
Last motherfucker who robbed
the Red Sox like this was Jack Clark.
Looked around the block.
There's no cars, no vans around. Nothing.
Maybe we're too early. Or too late.
Let's go. I want this street clear. Come on,
get these people out of here. Let's go.
We've been trying to hail security for the
cash room. We're not getting a response.
Okay, let's go,
Let's get the fuck out of here.
Come on.
Come on.
Shit.
-Fuck!

That's us inside.
Go! Go!

-He all right?
He's all right. They just got the vest.
Yo, Dez, get the plunger!
Shut it!
Dez?
Come on, come on.
They look like EMTs.
I count four. Maybe one down.
Go.
Let's get the fuck out of here.
There's a million fucking cops
out there.
Dez!
Listen.
The three of us, even if we get out of here,
we're getting the full ride, okay?
You walk out with your hands up,
you could get seven years.
No one'll think the worse of you.
Fuck you.
Cover your ears!
No!
All right, go, go, go.
All right, move it out.
Fuck you!
Move down.
Get them the fuck out of here.
Meet me at the fucking switch!
They ain't looking for fucking cops.
I'm gonna roll out the front...
...the two of youse beat it out
the side in the fucking cop uniforms.
The whole fucking force
is out there, kid.
You know I can take a pinch.
Don't worry about it.
I'll only give them your first name.
Clear.
Okay, go.
Move, move.
Hey, don't move. Don't move.
-Put your weapons down.
Fuck you. Boston P,D.
Look out, coming through.
Stand down, Stand down.
See you in Florida, kid.
See you when you get back.
All right. Go.
All right, guys, let's back up.
Feds got this.
Hey. Hey.
You B.P.D. need to fuck off.
What are you doing?
it's an FBI crime scene.
Don't put your hand up to me, Go.
Jurisdiction, guys. Walk away.
That's my kill.
I don't know if we're dealing with...
...some high level of genius here
with security...
...but security's saying
they got hit by cops.
Cops?
Yeah. Two cops, they said.
Hold up.
Where you going?
Pull up here.
Officer, can you hold up a minute?
Visual on Coughlin,
heading south toward Boylston.
Hotel parking lot on Van Ness.
He's dressed as B.P.D.
Copy.
Officer.
Coughlin.
Drop your weapon!
No!
Move! Move!
Coughlin, throw down your weapon.
Fuck you.
Let me see those hands, right now.
Fuck you!
Move, move.
You got 30 seconds, asshole.
Okay.
I surrender.
I surrender.
Rusty, something went wrong.
Come here.
Fergie.
Prick.
Fergie...
...remember who clipped your nuts
for you.
I came in hot, saw the suspect run
across the street with a Tec-9.
I lit up the tires, I jumped out of the cruiser,
engaged the suspect in gunfire.
So that's when...
-...you get out of your cruiser.
Yeah.
At that point, I fired, struck the suspect
at least once or twice.
Hey.
Multiple victims down.
Location, 529 Main Street, Charlestown.
-Uniformed officers on the scene.
-That's the Florist,
Hey, Bobby, Bobby, what happened?
Somebody got Fergie.
-Jesus Christ, that's gotta be MacRay.
-Fuck,
Claire, it's me.
Are you okay?
I'll be fine. I know.
But I'm okay. I'm all right.
Claire, I wanna meet you.
It's gotta be soon.
I don't have a lot of time.
Can you meet me?
Claire, please.
I need to know. I gotta go.
Can you come here?
You want me
to come where you are now?
Mm-hm.
I don't think
that's a good idea for me.
Why?
What if there are police there?
There's no one here.
All right, well, if you think I should
probably come by there...
...then I guess that's what I'll do. Yeah.
Okay.
Claire, listen, I'm--
Listen. Listen to me.
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry for what I did to you.
Remember that.
Come down in the back
and let me in in about an hour:
All right?
I'll see you.
Wait, Doug? Doug?
-Yeah.
-I want you to come.
I really wanna see you.
It'll be just like one of my sunny days.
Well...
...I'm on my way then.
Bye.
Goodbye, Claire.
All right,
I'd say we've done our part here.
You know what? Not now.
He says he's coming, I want people
at Logan, South Station...
...downtown, Greyhound,
subway, everything. Now.
The city's covered.
Good.
We 're secure, and everything 's ready.
-Sir, we need you to stay off the street.
-Just going to work. No problem.
-How long?
-Forty minutes.
-Alleyway clear?
-Yes, sir.
We got nothing.
Still no movement in the alley. Over.
Well, I guess he didn't have as big a thing
for you as you thought.
I guess not.
"My sunny days."
You know, Claire,
we are a national organization.
All right, boys, let's pack it up.
He ain't coming.
Let's get the description out.
Let's go.
We know what he looks like.
Let's go ind him.
All right. You good?
Hey, best possible outcome, you know.
Well done, well done.
It's for you.
Claire, take this.
You'll do better with it than I can.
By the time you read this,
I'll be long gone.
Not the way I planned it...
...but for the first time in my life,
l?n leaving this city.
Maybe if I go...
...I can stop looking.
No matter how much you change...
You still have to pay the price
for the things you've done.
So I got a long road.
But I know i'll see you again.
This side or the other.
