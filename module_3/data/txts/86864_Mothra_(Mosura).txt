''Mothra''
(Mosura)
Just passing the Caroline lslands,
Typhoon number eight...
...has developed into a
more powerful storm.
lts center winds are calculated at 60 meters
per second with gusts of 80 meters per second!
lt's traveling at 50 km per hour on a northerly
course towards the Japanese mainland!
Attention all stations! Attention all stations!
The 5400 ton vessel, Genyo-maru...
...is caught near the center
of Typhoon number eight!
Please standby for
distress signals!
Navigator, what is our
present position?!
We are about four miles
east of lnfant lsland!
What? lnfant lsland?!
This is bad. We're drifting
that way quickly.
Damn...
The typhoon will push us
into the radiation!
Captain! Hold on!
We've hit a reef!
We're taking water!
We're taking water!
Abandon ship!
Right! Abandon ship!
Abandon ship!
They went down around this radioactive area.
lt doesn't look good for them.
Hey, our fuel is getting low.
This is helicopter JH-20 calling.
We've just made our first pass, over.
There doesn't seem to be any survivors.
We are returning to base.
What's that?
They're humans!
Helicopter JH-20 calling from
sector K in the test area, over.
We are flying over lnfant lsland
and have discovered four survivors.
Hey! We're here! Hey!
Just a moment!
Just a moment!
You will be given a chance for
an interview soon enough!
Hey, can't we go in
and see them?
Let us take some pictures!
That isn't asking too much!
Wait!
Let us in!
Dr. Harada...
...we've just completed the tests.
We didn't find radiation
on any of them.
According to my calculations,
this is scientifically impossible.
None of you have had any
physical problems recently?
Do you know what l'm saying? None of you
have any pain or inflammation of the joints?
Yes, we're all fine.
Excuse me...
What is it?
The truth is...
...l am a little hungry. That's because
they let us eat a lot on the ship.
Hey, hey!
l'm with the Nitto Newspaper.
Nitto Newspaper?
Photographers are not
allowed in here.
l'll have to ask for your camera.
Ten-chan!
l'm Fukuda from the
Nitto Newspaper.
Who are you?
Don't you know the radiation...
But there's no emergency,
that's what you said.
l'm right, aren't l?
l'm Fukuda, pleased to meet you.
Since he's here, we may
as well let them stay.
He's our ''snapping turtle''.
Snapping turtle?
Oh, sorry...
What she means is when l get a hold of
a story for the newspaper, l never let go.
About these guys...
Well, it's big news when they manage to
survive radioactive counts of three million.
You'd think they'd
be dead, huh?
So, the first thing you want to know is how they
survived a radioactive count of three million?
Yes. This time l would like
to ask them myself...
...how they managed to stay
healthy in that radioactive area.
l want to be sure l fully
understand what happened.
How could all these men survive in
an area so polluted by radiation?
That's it. lt was the
red juice they gave us.
Red juice?
What is that?
lt's what the natives
there gave us.
The natives...
Did you say natives?!
On lnfant lsland?!
This will put us on top!
The headline will read,
''The Mysterious Natives of lnfant lsland''.
What? That seems a
bit overdramatic.
Be quiet. Put in what the
Rolisikan ambassador said.
The Rolisikan government
assures you...
...that we've thoroughly investigated
lnfant lsland for natives.
We're not sure
where they were...
...at the exact time of
the atomic blast.
Ambassador, are you going
to send an expedition?
The Rolisikan government has
no plans at this time.
l wonder if anyone is an
authority on those islands?
Dr. Chuzo should be
able to assist us.
Chuzo?
He's an anthropologist.
He led the Polynesian
expedition several years ago.
Good. Let's set up an
interview right away.
l've already contacted him and
sent Misgi to get a photo of him.
That was stupid!
What does it look like?
lt's terrible!
-How is it?
What the heck is this?
That's a great shot!
He doesn't like
being photographed.
What a problem...
l have a feeling this is really big!
Hey, Chuzo...
Why won't you tell us all
about the expedition?
You are the leader
of the group, right?
You can hear all about it from
the Rolisikan government.
Take his photo when
he looks up.
l understand, l understand...
We won't try to take your photo.
At least let us see your face.
l don't have to
show you my face.
What is it?
What's going on?
Sorry about that.
Hey, Shinji! Shinji!
Yes!
l told you to keep your
pets in your room!
l was looking all over for it!
Chiro! Come here, Chiro!
Chiro! Chiro!
Just a moment...
l'll go and get it, alright?
Don't hurt yourself!
l'm fine...
Did you find it?
What's the matter?
What is it?!
Here.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Let's discuss the island.
You are going on the expedition?
l haven't heard of one yet.
l'm sure you'll hear from them.
lsn't it amusing?
This has got to be an incredible
discovery for someone like you.
lt should open a new
field of study for you.
Well, it should be interesting.
All of the Polynesian
islanders share...
...a basic language
structure and culture.
Does that mean that they are similar
to the people of Hawaii or Tahiti?
Legends say...
...that the Polynesian people were the
descendants of the ancient continent of Atlantis.
Do you believe what l'm saying?
l only believe what l
see through the camera.
Then believe only
in what you see.
The sound of a shutter reminds
me of the sound of a guillotine.
A guillotine?
That's a good one!
Please be careful...
Just like a guillotine, you'll never
know when you're hit with a photo.
Wasn't that Dr. Harada?
He's the leader of the Japanese expedition.
Hey, Michi!
Out of the way please.
Out of the way.
What? The reporters have been
shut out from the expedition?
Who was it that made
such a demand?!
l'm sure you're all curious as to why
reporters won't be allowed on this expedition.
There's no particular
reason why.
We just want the mission
to be successful.
Then you're saying that the
press would just get in the way?
No, no, no...
You and l see things differently.
This mission is my
responsibility.
l won't need the
services of the press.
lt's a good thing
you're out here.
l don't think reporters
were allowed in there!
Hey, who is this Nelson guy?
Oh, he's the leader
of the expedition.
l know that,
but who is he really?
l don't think he's a scientist.
Why doesn't he want reporters?
Does he have something to hide?
Don't you think so?
l do.
Then he is suspicious.
He's suspicious.
Hey, is that what you think?
Then what do we do about it?
You must be joking!
Good luck!
Good luck!
Ten-chan!
Ten-chan!
Oh, Dr. Harada...
ls your meeting over already?
lt's a good thing that
you're taking it easy.
What was the meeting about?
Nelson is not a friendly man.
Nelson told me that he wants to see the
expedition's data before it's released.
That's crazy!
He doesn't have any scientific background
and he wants to have the reports?
l wonder what kind of
business he's in?
Come out!
What are you doing here?
l'm just cleaning.
You were using that to clean?
l found it.
What is it anyway?
A Nitto Newspaper reporter
doesn't make a good cabin boy.
l thought l was good.
Oh, well...
Just a moment.
You don't think l'm just going
to let you walk out of here?
What are you doing here?
What is the meaning of this?
l just wanted to ask...
...if my research has to be
passed on to you as well?
Of course.
Then, it's an order from
the Rolisikan government?
lt's my requirement
for this expedition.
Then l'm ignoring it!
Let's go.
We will be approaching the site
of the expedition in a short while.
You should you now put on your safety
gear to shield you from the radiation.
Dr. Harada, how was it?
Did you talk to Nelson?
l convinced Nelson to let
him come with us...
...as long as he agreed not
to do any reporting.
You could say l'm your cabin boy.
Excuse me.
l'm Fukuda, with Nitto.
Here...
Thanks.
Here...
Dr. Harada...
Why hasn't anyone decided to
stand up against Nelson's control?
Even Dr. Roth reports to him, huh?
ls that what you say?
Then, if Dr. Roth...
l'm a cabin boy.
Sorry...
lt is now time for us
to go ashore.
l hope each and every one
of you does your best...
...to make this expedition
a great success.
Now, if any of you
encounter any problems...
...the button on your right shoulder
is a silent alarm transmitter.
Do not use it unless you are in urgent need
of assistance, and we'll go to your location.
Please be patient in your research.
Dismissed.
Chuzo!
What do you think
you're doing?!
l'm lost.
What?
l am lost!
l have been looking for Chuzo.
What in the world
did l step into?
This isn't normal growth.
They all look like fungus.
That's it, they're all
giant fungus.
The survivors must have
drank theirjuice...
...in order to stay alive.
l'm not sure which direction
we should go from here.
lt's amazing...
Doctor!
l can't seem to find Chuzo.
That way!
Chuzo! What's wrong?
Chuzo! Chuzo!
Chuzo!
Hang in there!
Chuzo!
Chuzo!
Chuzo... Chuzo...
Hello.
Don't say that!
What happened?
A blood-sucking plant
attacked me.
That's it...
And then l was saved by
two small women.
Small people?
You're sure you didn't see children?
No.
l thought they were about
30 centimeters tall.
l could swear they were girls
no larger than dolls!
What? Doll women?
You sure that you didn't
imagine this?
No! They were real!
Well, we can't go back tonight.
We'll have to go back first
thing in the morning.
Hey, how did these beauties
come by to help you?
Beauties?
Oh, it's a journalist term.
You had a vision of two young ladies.
We like to call them beauties.
l got it!
Huh? What is it?
That's it!
Well, good night.
How's that for gratitude?
How can l interview you this way?
Jeez, l must be slipping.
What's the matter?
Chuzo!
-What's happening?
l think this has gone too far.
l'm not playing games.
l was wondering how they
found me last night...
...when l figured that they were
attracted to the sound of my alarm.
A song!
They're communicating by song!
No, that's not a song.
lt's their way of speech.
l'm not sure how
they're doing it...
...but it's an unusual
form of language.
Can you understand what
they're saying right now.
lt sounds like they want us to
leave their island alone.
Oh, of course!
They want us to take our atomic
tests somewhere else!
There will definitely not be
any more nuclear tests.
You're very rude!
What do you think
you're doing?!
l know movie producers who
would want these girls.
Release those two
girls this instant!
Doctor!
Nelson...
Natives!
They're coming!
They're over here too!
Retreat! Retreat!
Release them now.
l have what we came here for!
Well, don't expect us to fight for you.
Sentries put down your weapons.
Put down your weapons!
Boss, what do we do?
Are you sure?
Give them to me.
Let's get back to the ship!
Return to the ship!
-Fall in!
Hey, doctor...
l wasn't sure what to
think at first...
...but l think we're lucky to
come to this island.
The ship has finally docked.
The investigative team...
...led by Nelson, the meteorologist,
traveled to study the mysteries of life.
What amazing stories will
they have to report?
A special event?
lt wasn't just a special event.
They went to an island hit with
three million counts of radiation!
What happened to Fukuda?
l want you to find him!
Ten-chan!
Welcome back!
Welcome back.
Thank you for going there.
ls this what happened to
you all this time?
l was very worried about you!
The desk editor is furious!
Come on.
Was this your only
trip to the island?
Why didn't we receive
more reports?
Hey, wait a minute!
You can't leave without
telling us anything!
Clark Nelson.
Date of birth and birthplace, unknown.
Pre-war history is unknown.
ln 1954, he traveled to the Amazon
in search of a native tribe there.
Although the mission was a failure,
he was praised for a job well done.
l'm thinking...
...doesn't he seem like an
international art broker to you?
An art broker?
Sure... The type who seeks out
ancient art and steals it to sell.
lt's a profitable business!
Doesn't that seem like
a far-fetched idea?
Right. But this guy...
Guess what map l found when
l was caught in his room?
lnfant lsland.
Fukuda, l found something
strange on the island.
Fukuda, here it is.
What is it?
What is this?
l found this on a rock beyond a
cave l discovered on lnfant lsland.
A cave?
Did you say you found a cave?
lt was an unusual cave.
l would have told
Dr. Harada about it...
...but Nelson was always around.
The same symbol is all
over this thing.
l think the message is
a reference to it.
Through the use of my manuals
on all of the Polynesian dialects...
...l think l know what it is.
Then what does the symbol mean?
Mothra.
Huh? Mothra?
What could that mean?
l don't know.
You're both very cute girls.
l'm glad that l could see you again.
Boss! The natives!
Fire!
Fire and then retreat!
Mothra...
Mothra...
Mothra...
How long have you been
our ''snapping turtle''?
Five years, three months.
What?!
And you saw these girls
on lnfant lsland?
Don't say that!
Why didn't you file the story?!
Well?
Well, we didn't want
them to get hurt.
Damn! That's your
problem to deal with!
The scientists are human.
What?
The entire expedition
group agreed to it...
...but we didn't expect this
guy to put them into showbiz!
These girls are human!
We didn't want them
to get hurt!
l'm a human, too!
Welcome, everyone.
We are living in the
atomic age.
But people, does that mean
there are no mysteries of life?
Have all of its wonders
become obsolete?
No! Life is not without its mysteries!
-Let's go up front.
This mystery is not a dream.
Tonight you will see the original
life, the original mystery...
lt is what l've discovered in my
journey to the South Pacific.
l hope you enjoy the
two lovely fairies.
Did you come alone?
No, my father is
somewhere in the back.
l spoke with Dr. Roth
earlier today.
lt seems the Rolisikan government wasn't
too enthusiastic about our expedition.
Oh, they were having
financial difficulties, huh?
All of the financing
was provided by Nelson.
So, he was your sponsor?
No wonder why he
wanted to come along.
That melody...
Well, stop your meddling.
Please go home.
l'm not meddling.
l want an interview!
Well, that's enough for me.
l don't want you to know anything
more about my mysterious ladies.
Hey!
What are you doing?
No! No!
l'm not leaving!
-You're going now!
What's going on?
Ten-chan!
Nelson!
lt's been a while, huh?
l need to talk to you.
Talk?
Stop this inhumane show.
Return the girls to their island.
lnhumane...?
You're crazy!
We make sure they get the
best of everything!
These two mysterious girls aren't just
human beings, they're genuine treasures.
What are you saying?
My paper will tell all about
what you're doing here!
You do and we'll sue
you for slander!
Then why don't you tell me
how much this fiend...
...profits from using these
girls like slaves!
Slaves...? Don't be ridiculous!
Do you think we use them like that?
My mysterious girls wouldn't
sing if they weren't happy.
Then where are the girls?
Well, l don't know if this is right, but
l'll let you see them forjust 3 minutes!
lf you're wondering if the girls are
happy, you can see for yourself.
Miss, the camera, please.
l have all the
advertising l need.
You're so rude!
You can have it!
Please don't be worried.
Oh, they're pretty!
Do you understand me?
l'm the one you saved
from the blood-sucking plant.
Hey, they look so
frightened and scared.
Why don't we try
to free them?
No.
We don't want Nelson to realize
what we plan to do just yet.
But l don't like that guy.
We all feel the same
way about that!
Hey, l hope you're doing well.
We don't think anyone in the world
has the right to hold you like this.
Thank you.
The two of us do not
wish to be here.
You finally understand
what we're saying?
We do not have a
use for words.
We understand through
feelings and ideas.
Telepathy, huh?
Telepathy, right!
We truly want to return
home as soon as possible...
But...
But, what?
She will come to rescue us...
...regardless of what happens
to your country...
...and that fills us
with great sadness.
Great sadness?
What's happening?
Mothra is coming.
Mothra?
Mothra is coming here...
...to rescue us.
Mothra...
...open your eyes.
Mothra...
...your people are
in need of you.
We need you to
awaken for us now.
Look at this story!
l want a retraction!
Anyway, you're paper had no
right printing this story.
lt is my newspaper's
responsibility to report the truth.
Alright, you won't retract
it for me, huh?
l'm going to the
Rolisikan ambassador.
Your company will have
big problems then.
Editor, thisjust came over
the ticker-tape machine.
A large object...
...unidentified, floating
in the South Pacific.
What does it mean?
Mothra is coming.
Mothra.
What the hell is a Mothra?
lnfant lsland has a legend,
about a huge protector!
lt's coming to
rescue the girls!
That'sjust a load of
garbage to sell newspapers.
l heard it directly
from the girls!
What?
He's not lying.
Mothra is coming to
rescue the two girls.
Everyone, what you are hearing, is
one of the great wonders of life.
The only way to enjoy this
spectacle is to hear it for yourself.
Hard to port!
-Hard to port!
Shut up!
All of you just shut up!
You want us to shut up?!
l'm not the one responsible
for destroying the Orion!
This has no relation to me.
That's how it is.
We have nothing to do with an
attack that was caused by a monster.
ls that so?
lf you weren't holding onto the girls,
Mothra wouldn't be coming here!
Coming to Japan!
To Tokyo!
Think of the destruction!
Stop spreading lies!
Your opinion is wrong.
Nelson!
Be quiet!
Regardless of what
you say, it's pointless.
lf you push this any further, we'll
report you to the Rolisikan embassy.
You don't want to be
indicted by them, do you?
lndicted?
Fine by me!
Arrest us if you can!
Chuzo, it seems hopeless.
l hate to say it, but it
looks bad for those two.
But, if we saw them
once more...
Once more?
Let's go talk to the girls.
What is it?
We want to talk to the girls.
You can't!
No one goes in without
the boss' approval!
l understand.
You think l'm joking?!
You...!
Stop it.
Stop it!
l wish you would
just cooperate!
What's going on here?!
Damn you!
This can't be helped.
l'll take care of these guys.
Hurry...
Go talk to the girls.
Thank you.
Let me go! Let me go!
Let me go, l said!
You're dealing with the Snapping Turtle!
l'm not just a simple fast-talker!
ls there no way that you two can
prevent this from happening?
Don't you have a way that you
can control Mothra's strength?
Mothra has no way
to understand.
Mothra is coming to us
through her own instincts.
Really?
There's really no way
you can control her?
We're very sorry...
...but there's
nothing we can do.
That's it! Once more!
lt's telepathy!
Can telepathy be stopped?
Can you do it?
We're testing something now
that might be able to help us.
This material was
designed with the hope...
...that it could prevent radio waves
from affecting the oscilloscope.
l see...
lf we could put them in a box made of this,
Mothra may not know where to find them.
l've found it!
lt's about a hundred meters long!
Position? Okay, 137 degrees, 2 minutes north.
23 degrees, 10 minutes east.
lts current speed is 1 1 knots,
heading for Tokyo!
Scramble our first air squadron.
We're right on top!
What? The lawsuit against us?
Oh, that'sjust a distraction.
Well, we'll be there to
cover the Mothra battle.
Alright.
Well, l feel sorry for Mothra.
What?
lt's all Nelsom's fault!
lf he would just release...
Damn!
What's the matter?
The Rolisikan government
is supporting Nelson!
What?
The Rolisikan government
states that it is obliged...
...to protect the rights of
its citizens abroad.
Head to the defense office.
Find out their plans!
Target sighted.
Open bomb bays!
Bombs away!
Bombs away!
Everything you've
tried was useless.
Are you certain that
Mothra is really dead?
Of course, but l'm not
worried about that.
l'm not so sure
that she is gone...
...so take the box with you
as a simple precaution.
Yes, yes...
ln case l'm wrong.
lt's certainly not
for your sake!
Hey!
Excuse me.
We're only interested...
...in protecting others
from your selfishness.
That's why we're giving you this box
to stop them using their telepathy.
lt's to prevent any
misunderstanding.
l'm here!
Thanks for coming.
l am very lucky!
You're kidding.
What? Between god,
prayers and my friends...
...l'm not chivalrous enough to
go against Mothra for this pay!
Well, you're not alone there.
ls that an earthquake?
lt doesn't feel like one.
Thank you, thank you.
Well, l don't think that l'll need it,
but l'll use the box as you suggest.
How about it?
The show is about to start.
No.
Oh, you won't need
any money.
You can all be guests
on my behalf.
Mr. Nelson, it's
the phone for you.
Just a moment, please.
Hello? This is Nelson.
Huh? What?
Cancel it?!
The Japanese Police are cruel!
Why should l cancel it?
Then go ahead and get it!
How rude!
Ten-chan!
You don't know what happened!
l know, l know...
Nelson was called to cancel the show.
You're wrong! Something
happened at Dam number three!
The dam?
lncredible...
Mothra!
lt may destroy it!
Let's hurry!
Let's go!
What's that?!
lt's breaking!
Run! Run away!
Stop it!
Alright!
l don't know how, but your pet is
not taking you back to your island!
Be quiet!
l won't tell you any more!
ln the case.
Get away!
Halt! Halt! Halt! Halt!
Halt! Halt! Halt!
Stop! Stop!
Doctor, it has to be Mothra!
-Here, hold this for me.
How did she get here?
You can't do this!
You must leave the bridge!
lt's no good!
Leave! Leave!
Hurry! Hurry!
Look out!
Hurry! Hurry!
Ten-chan!
Mothra is angry because...
...Nelson is holding the two
small girls against their will.
For their sake, l am
taking them from him.
l hate Nelson.
Where could he have gone?
What's the matter?
A kid managed to get
in the building.
He was wearing a red cap.
That kid could be a problem.
Damn that Mothra!
Anyway, we have to get rid of
that kid for our own sake. Hurry!
l'm going to let you go.
Thank you...
...but Mothra is coming for us.
You should hurry and get away!
l'll be alright!
When l get you home...
...my brother will return
you to your island.
You bastard! How could
you let him get away?!
ldiots! What's going on here?!
Well, a kid broke
into the building and...
Go find that kid!
Find him now!
There he is!
Hey!
-Wait!
Hey, you! Wait!
-Get back here!
Did you find him?
We can't find him anywhere!
Damn! Where did he go?!
Boss! Here he is!
ldiot!
Editor! The Rolisikan
government is backing down!
The Rolisikan government is
afraid of losing its ties to Japan...
...and is ordering Nelson
to release the girls!
Alright! You're the top!
l'm going over to the theater!
l want to see the look on Nelson's face!
lt's terrible!
l know, l know!
Wait for me here!
Hey!
Chuzo! What brings you here?
What's going on?
Nelson's about to be spooked!
My little brother said he was
coming here to free the two girls.
Huh...?
Hold this!
Fukuda! This is Shinji's!
You don't suppose...
Shinji!
Shinji! Shinji!
Hey!
-Shinji!
Shinji!
Shinji! Shinji!
Brother!
You're safe now.
Are you okay?
Brother, l let you down!
lt's alright!
Don't worry, Nelson will get
what's coming to him.
Hey, it's terrible!
l know. Nelson, right?
What are you saying?!
Mothra's on her way here!
What did you say?
Mothra? Where?!
She's making her way
toward Tokyo!
Mothra's passed Mount Fuji and is heading
for the city where Unit 2 is waiting. Roger.
Yes, Unit 2 is ready.
Waiting for orders.
Unit 3 is moving into
position within the city.
With Mothra approaching...
...residents of the Shibuya ward are asked
to evacuate to the emergency shelters.
All residents of Shibuya...
...please evacuate your homes and make
your way to the emergency shelters.
Fall back! Fall back!
Boss, this way is no good!
Perhaps it would be better if
we went toward the sea?
Turn around.
l have an idea.
...Ameike, Akasaikami. Those areas have just
been evacuated. Let's try to stop it there.
lt's currently at Goma 2-1 .
Mothra is making its way toward Tokyo Tower.
All of the local population
there has been evacuated.
Ready to fire!
Ready to fire!
Wait for the commander's orders!
Yes, sir. Our unit is
ready to attack. Roger.
Stand by!
What's that?
Base, base! Mothra is
building a cocoon!
Mothra will grow in the cocoon
until it's ready to leave.
That's probably how they'll
return to lnfant lsland.
General, has Nelson been found?
He was last seen at the theater,
but no one has seen him since then.
Boss...
You're George Walker,
with the Rolisikan ambassador.
Alright?
Excuse me.
Editor!
l'm not paying you to sightsee!
How about Mothra making a cocoon?
What about Nelson?
l haven't found where he is.
Do l have to play
''G-Man'' for you, too?
This Mothra in front of
us isn't a story!
Your behavior is disgraceful!
There hasn't been any
sighting of Nelson up to now!
The first thing Nelson would do...
...is to get on jet bound for Rolisika
either tonight or tomorrow.
How would that be possible?
l'm sure he
could pull a few strings.
He'll do anything to
keep the girls away from Mothra.
Let's go to Hanada Airport!
Excuse me.
The military command
of the Rolisikan government...
...is willing to loan you
its best offensive weapon.
These atomic heat cannons...
...will they be here in
time to assist us?
Please relax. They will
be here within ten hours.
With Mothra cocooned
on Tokyo Tower...
...the army intends to surround
the creature while it's dormant.
They hope to launch an
attack while it is asleep...
...to end this confrontation
without a large assault.
The Japanese and Rolisikan governments
hope the atomic heat cannons will do the job.
ln front of us, Mothra is not moving.
The attack will begin shortly.
Hey!
lncredible...
We will begin our
attack at 10:00.
Your attention please!
Your attention please!
The military will begin
its attack at 10:00!
When the atomic
cannons begin firing...
...it is recommended that you
wear your protective glasses!
Attacking in sixty seconds!
Ten-chan, your glasses.
Thirty seconds!
Twenty seconds!
Ten seconds... 9... 8... 7...
6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1 ...
There is no doubt everyone,
that the cocoon was...
Boss, with no one to follow us,
we should be alright.
You're right.
We're not in Japan anymore.
This is my home in Rolisika.
Mothra would never figure out
that we would hide on a farm.
lt appears that the monster...
...known as Mothra has been defeated.
A military commander is
heading towards a microphone.
Everyone... everyone in the
entire world, please wait.
Mothra has been confirmed dead!
Boss, boss!
We're safe now, huh?
Well, sing! Keep singing!
You'll sing a long time
before Mothra shows up!
Chuzo!
Look! Mothra seems to be
heading for Rolisika.
Right, doctor?
Well, Nelson won't be
safe in Rolisika.
Rolisikan patrol jets are in
the sky searching for Mothra.
On that matter, public opinion
of the Rolisikan people...
...have turned against
Nelson as this continues.
The Rolisikan police have been instructed to
arrest Nelson on sight, and they are actively...
Boss, this won't work!
lf we go out there,
we'll be picked up for sure!
Hey, l have something
important to tell you.
What are you doing here?
l've been asked to help
the Rolisikan government.
Don't tell me...
...that they want our help
in trying to speak to Mothra?
You're right.
l'm right?!
Sure... What could we
possibly say to it?
No, our problem is the girls.
We're the only ones that they've
spoken to that they seem to trust.
l see...
But where do we find the girls?
First of all, we find Nelson...
...and they'll be happy
to return to lnfant lsland.
Your attention please.
We've just learned...
...that Mothra has been sighted
in the Newkirk City area.
Boss, l don't like this plan.
Chuzo, what do we do now.
Should we open it here?
No!
How would Mothra react
if she knew they were here?
We shouldn't put these
people through that!
Newkirk City is in bad shape.
Chuzo...
Do you remember this?
Oh, the symbol on lnfant lsland?
That's right.
Look up there!
l get it!
That symbol must have some
special significance with Mothra.
Right.
Hey, those bells...
They remind me of the girls songs.
Chuzo, is there any way...
...that we can use this mark
and the sound of the bells?
Mothra and the sound of prayers...
And songs...
Alright, let's do it.
We need you to have this symbol drawn
as large as possible on the airport runway.
This?
Yes. We need it as
soon as possible.
We'll do it.
And then, can you get the church
bells of every town to ring at 3:00?
You want them to ring at 3:00?
Yes.
Okay, l'll see what l can do.
Do you think it will work?
Well, l don't doubt
the power of prayer.
lt's not so mysterious,
but it's all up to god, now.
Well, we better get going.
lt's 3:00.
l'm not sure...
But it seems to be quiet.
lt's coming this way!
ls it okay?
Alright. lt's landing.
Thank you, everyone.
We pray that our land and yours
will live in peace and harmony.
Thank you.
We promise not to disturb
the peace of lnfant lsland.
Thank you.
Mothra is waiting for us.
Goodbye!
Take care.
l'm not sure if we'll have peace
and harmony, but we'll do fine.
Goodbye.
Goodbye!
Goodbye!
That's it!
l've got to call the editor!
lt's a top story!
Oh, no!
-Huh?
l didn't get a picture!
lt's alright!
The path of peace......
is yours to discover for eternity.
