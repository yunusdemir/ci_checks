Deliver Us From Evil
It all begins out here in the rural
parts of the country -
- where the larks draw scribbles
in the sky -
- and where the road takes you
either forward or backward.
Everything is so calm out here. A safe,
little cosmos for safe people -
- who easily distinguish between
right and wrong.
Because here, the world is simple.
Yet we set out in the middle of
a conflict -
- in the children's room
with Frederik and Viola.
- What's going on here?
- He pinches me.
Pernille is a good mother.
Isn't all mothers good?
Loving, caring...
In our house we don't hit
anybody.
Teaches in the local public
school.
Always supports her husband, which
says quite a bit -
- because there was far from Oslo
to 'redneck' country.
You have to act kind to those
who a smaller than yourself.
- You have to be kind to anybody.
- You can hit bad people.
There is no such thing as bad people.
Only people who are not loved.
- Do they get evil, then?
- They get sad.
And sometimes they do bad things.
- Osama bin Laden is loved.
- I don't think so.
- He misses love.
- But he is not sad.
- I think he is.
- Why is he smiling, then?
- But he isn't smiling.
- He is smiling all the time.
Now, brush your teeth!
This is Anna. She is Pernille's
colleague -
- and her bag is full of additions
to the school's hymn book.
It is a part of the religion
class.
Anna is an angel, but her heart
is too big.
It is saturday. Take a good look
at her. This is your last chance.
Anna is going to die shortly.
This is Lars. We all know someone
like Lars.
One of those, who was last in line,
when the Lord picked destinies.
Life is not fair, and Lars
knows this all to well.
I called you 20 times.
I'm so sorry for everything.
It's such a fucking mess.
We have to put an end to all the crap.
Everything will be different now.
Positive? What the fuck do mean,
positive?
- I am pregnant.
- Doesn't sound fucking positive.
I do kind of like you, Scarlett,
alright?
Pick up the phone and call me.
For fuck's sake.
But at a truck rest between Hamborg
and Krusaa Lars sees the light.
Perhaps a sign. Lars might have
sensed something.
Because Lars is tired from
being alone in the truck -
- his ass in the seat doing nothing
between Rotterdam and Vestjylland.
Tired from coming home on saturdays
only to drink with the friends.
Tired because the Lord doens't give
a shit. Lars wants to control his own fate.
Go home and take the girlfriend.
From this day everything will be different.
Today a new life begins.
12 bar, 12 times atmospheric
pressure.
You can shoot a nail directly through
an oak plank at 2 meters distance.
Or as I used to say, from here
to Esbjerg.
- Do you still give 10 percent.
- We can arrange something.
Excuse me for a second.
This is Johannes.
This is the story's second
protagonist. Brother of Lars.
Married to Pernille. Father of
Viola and Frederik.
Top lawyer and far away from
Lars' chaotic world.
Returned to his birth place, when he
finally persuaded Pernille.
Because Johannes has always loved
the beautiful sky of Vestjylland.
And the birth place was just
standing there, decaying.
And Lars couldn't afford it.
- Hi, Jo. Is everything alright?
- We're finally getting somewhere.
- Is Viola well again?
- Yes, the penicillin helped.
- How about the house?
- It's taking ages.
- And Alain is...
- Alain bows, smiles, digs.
I wonder if he was born like that
or if it has to do with the shock?
The world can be cruel.
- Well, here's the circus.
- Amazing, how effective they are.
Like the plague they spread across
the country. Dilapidated amusements -
- fastfood, postcard with huge tits
on a piece of chalk.
Why are they always called Johnny,
Jimmy or Tim's Tivoli?
Why do men with English names
always gang up?
- Are you coming?
- We are going to Hanna's theater.
There you are. Traitor.
What is worse? Jimmy or Johnny
or six hours with Lars Nor√©n?
- I have to buy a chainsaw.
- A chainsaw?
- The trees in my driveway take the light.
- They only sell electric chainsaws.
I have one, that goes on gas.
Come by and get it.
- Don't you need it yourself?
- I have two. Excuse me.
- Later.
- Yes. This is Johannes.
You have to file it. Talk to Britt.
Goodbye then, cheers.
Ingvar, married to Anna.
No. Dependent on Anna.
The haulage and the town's Nestor.
Until the barracks became a refugee
camp he was a major -
- and commanded a lot of
young men.
- Johannes.
- Ingvar.
Ingvar quit the army. Also because
his son quit the army.
Not voluntarily, but with a bullet
in his chest in the former Yugoslavia.
They gave him a medal but it was
in fact only an accidental shot.
Yes, the sun is shining.
God is good
But Lars...
...drives a 2 million kr vehicle
and dumps it somewhere.
- Did you check with Rosen?
- Is he drinking again?
- We don't see each other, Ingvar.
- It's embarrassing.
It's the 500 year anniversary
and they are already completely drunk.
When I was in command, they had a
little backbone.
- Anna is with Pernille, right?
- Fresh hymns in the books.
As if the old ones weren't good
enough.
- God's peace.
- God's peace to you, Ingvar.
And Denmark back to the Eider.
Johannes is still smiling.
But of course he doesn't know
Ingvar's true face.
This is how Ingvar really is.
Why?
Because Ingvar's grief ate his
soul from inside.
The floor is for your feet, Eskild.
- Just once in a while comb you hair.
- I have a bad hair day.
- You have a bad hair day everyday.
- You're funny.
- What's going on?
- 200 kids have set the street on fire.
And an Al-Qaeda bomb went off
down in the gym.
- Do you want a lunch pizza?
- Does your girlfriend not make your lunch?
Only old farts have wifes, who
make lunches.
- Are you reading up on Alain?
- Was it on monday?
The psychologist gave a green light.
I gave Alain the summons earlier to day.
- What did he say?
- I had to draw it to him.
Alain here. Denmark here.
Alain go there. Bosnia there.
- He cried and ran out of the door.
- Just think about him running around.
He's nuts. Nobody wanted to be
alone with him in the camp.
To Alain going back is just like
being buried with his family.
Nobody can blame him for going
a little nuts, then.
Why does the whole world seek refuge
in Denmark, when the house is on fire?
If my house was on fire, I would
stay home and put the fire out.
- We need to see if he's going to the party.
- That sounds dangerous.
Yes. You risk getting candy floss
on your shirt collar.
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Alian, what's up?
- Hello.
- Are you only just arrived?
- I'm sorry.
- No it's alright. More than alright.
If you proceed like this we can be
finished in the afternoon.
Damn. You work like there was ten
of you.
Alain?
Alain, are you okay?
Yes... Yes.
[Danish song] I know where there
is a lark's nest, but I won't tell.
It's on a meadow out of sight...
It's on a meadow out of sight...
It's not clean enough. I've used
a little rinse.
- Perhaps it's the filter.
- How come Matthias has a mobile?
- How am I supposed to know that?
- Can I please have one?
- Can I please have one?
- Please?
- Can I please have one? Please?
- Can I please have one?
- Not even mom has a mobile phone.
Just because mom doesn't want one
it doesn't mean, that I can't have one.
You know what, dad?
You are old hippies.
Your time will soon be over, and
then it's our time.
- What's that?
- For the terrace.
- More tools?
- It's important to do things right.
Yes? Hi, Outzen.
Yes, yes. It seems like you know
how to do it. Talk to you later. bye.
Pernille!
Pernille, shit...
Hello, Lars.
What the hell is that?
Is it the sergeant?
What the hell is going on? You were not
supposed to be back until thursday.
Beer for everyone.
I don't know...is it okay to
smoke in the beer tent?
We smoke wherever we want to smoke.
If Lars fancies, he'll smoke a box
in Connie Hedegaard's ass.
[Connie Hedegaard was Danish
secretary for environment]
Did you see the nigger?
Why do you ask about the nigger?
- Didn't he drive a truck in Bosnia?
- What's up, Benny B B?
Hi, L-l-l-lars. You were not supposed
to be home until t-t-t-thursday.
- Damn, you are sweating like a pig.
- I'm putting up the t-t-t-tent.
- F-fat Finn and Funny Boyz are coming.
- F-fat Finn and F-funny Boyz?
- That sounds crazy.
- Are you sure it isn't M-madonna?
Or B-b-b-b. King?
They fucking told me it was
F-fat Finn and F-funny Boyz.
Go get some b-b-b-brews.
- Was Scarlett here yesterday?
- I believe so, right Silver?
- Was she alone?
- She played dice with Tonser.
- With Tonser?
- Yes. Tonser hit six all the time.
Fucking hell!
Stop it! Stop!
Ah, ah!
The whole town will be there. You
have a couple of drinks, kids are playing.
Dancing...You have to dance. Lots
of girls are there.
Come on. You love women and music
in the Balkans too.
Alain? Dancing. Dancing? Promise me
you'll go dancing just a little.
- Alain don't dance.
- Come on.
I bet you can get all the women.
You! All the women.
No, no, no.
Me Alain. No women.
Me... Alain.
Alain. Come here.
- Mom!
- Dad and Alain are gay. Come on.
Don't you love me any more?
What is that little nod supposed
to mean?
- I do fucking love you.
- Why would you fuck Tonser, then?
How the fuck does that all fit?
If you like caviar, you don't
eat shit.
- I don't understand what you mean.
- Why do you fuck Tonser?
- Because I am drunk and lonely.
- Because you were drunk and lonely.
Is that your fucking answer?
- What about the kid?
- What about it?
- It doesn't want to be drunk.
- I thought you didn't care.
This is not going to be one of
the good days.
It just isn't going to be good.
Tonser is going to take care of the
child.
I never know whether you come home.
I always come home, you little
slut. Don't I?
And you did it in front of all
the guys.
Why don't you just hit me?
Hey, hey, Alain. You have to
take some money.
- Yes. You need to be payed.
- No. We are friends.
- We are friends. No.
- Come on. Come.
- Thank you.
- Also these, please.
Ah. Who's that? Let me have a
look. Come on.
Look at how cute they are. Your
wife and your kids?
Where are they?
How can I be so stupid?
I need to learn how to think
before I talk.
Easy, easy. How is it going?
- Eh... thanks.
- Are you going to the party?
Randi, don't we have anything for
the big guy here?
- I suppose so. How is black?
- That sounds fine.
Alright. I'll see if I can find
anything.
Do you know what? I need to drive
the truck to the station. You take it.
You take it. Or does your faith prohibit
you to drive on saturdays?
What?
- You drive car.
- I can't.
I've been drinking. Scheisse-drunk, man.
Ingvar is going to kill me.
I drive truck.
- Biggest set we got.
- Looks great.
We take the 'tent', Randi. And a
pair of shoes.
- And a white shirt.
- Yes.
Wow...
Check in at the beer tent, when you
get back.
- Thanks, Lars. Thanks.
- We are drivers. Brothers.
- Brothers!
- Brothers.
Someone shags women,
someone shags men -
- but Noller shags someone
who says: Meheheh.
- But they don't need alimony.
- Lars? I knew you were here.
- Didn't you check in?
- Yes.
- In that condition?
- I got someone else to do it.
- Someone else?
- I was totally busted.
I had a couple of beers. It was
irresponsible to get behind the wheel.
- Who has the truck, then?
- The nigger.
- The nigger?
- The Bosnian animal. Alain.
- The nigger?
- I don't have anything against the black.
People from the African culture
are just as intelligent as we are.
'Nigger', that's just linguistics.
Denoting he's different.
Okay, he's a fucking muslim.
From down there.
But he is still a human being.
- You wont get payed for...
- He was a truck driver.
He was just like you. He's a
fucking good driver.
Being so hammered that other
people need to take care of the work...
The man has lost everything.
He's digging holes for Johannes.
He deserves a fucking break.
I know you believe that.
You do have a fucking heart.
A Christian heart, Ingvar.
Everyone knows that. Even if he's a
muslim-refugee-fucking-nigger.
You are not welcome anymore, Lars.
- So that's why you took Leif Christensen.
- Why is he here?
Because you are too big a pussy
to let me go on your own.
Come get what's left of your salary
on monday.
Yes sir, Mr. Major.
Your father worked himself to death
for his two sons.
But he didn't die completely in vain.
At least Johannes got somewhere.
You don't fucking take the Major's
piss.
Do you know what, Roald?
I don't give a fuck.
- Do you know why?
- Nah. Why?
- Because I'm getting married.
- Married? To whom?
- To that.
- You're shitting me!
Are you getting married to that?
We need to kiss the bride.
- Next round is on me.
- Pussy!!
- Hi uncle Lars.
- What the ...?
- Hi Lars.
- Hi Frede.
- Do you want to go to the stock cars?
- Uncle is too drunk.
- When was that ever a problem?
- Hello Pernille. You look lovely.
They say that people who are married
for a long time look alike.
If you are married to an ugly dog
you'll get ugly, but you look lovely.
Is it your girlfriend?
Hello. I'm Pernille.
- We are getting married.
- Wauw.
Scarlett has a bun in the oven.
So, now we buy a tv and a couch.
Congratulations. That's fantastic.
Just come here for a sec. Hit me
as hard as you can. Is that all?
- Did you hurt yourself?
- It's nothing.
- 'Nothing'?
- I slept with someone else.
- Do you have enough money?
- We have 100 each.
100 kr? That's because your dad
is stingy.
One, two, Three hundred. Just tell
me if you need more.
Give me a kiss.
Now hurry up and try the
amusements.
- Just wait.
- Ingvar is looking for you.
- Fuck you.
- Did you check in the car?
- Fuck you. I got your friend to do it.
- Who? Do what?
Alain took it back.
- You did what?
- Fuck you.
- Do you want me to get something else?
- Dry pig or charred cow?
- Let's go dancing.
- What?
- Let's go dancing!
- To that?
That's what I'm telling you.
There is not much man left in you.
Is there anything you want to tell me?
Ah..!
- Hello.
- Hi, Ingvar.
- I thought Anna was with you.
- I thought Anna was with you.
- Was that what you planned?
- We'll just do it tomorrow.
- She didn't come by your house?
- It was not set in stone.
But... She left this morning
with all the hymns.
Where is she? Where is she, then?
You better go after him.
Feet off the ground!
Friends. Here, in the top of
society -
- among directors, counts and
barons, the tv stars -
- pop- and superstars, I would like
to propose a toast -
- for my bride to be.
'What is the man talking about?
Those punks are worth shit.'
Blachman [tv host], shut the fuck up!
These are my friends and they are not out.
'How about that little whore?'
Shut up, Blachman!
She is my wife.
She is mine.
She is in second round!
Hey. We're all in fucking second
round.
- What's up, Pernille?
- What's up, Lars?
- Is your husband not dancing?
- I have to find my kids.
- I have to find the kids.
- They are enjoying themselves.
- Shouldn't you rather dance with her?
- Who?
- The one you beat up.
- She beats me up too, you know.
But then we fuck. We fuck like
the angels sing.
Stop it, Lars.
It might as well have been the two
of us. We would've had more kids.
We would have four-five kids, then.
And I would worship you like
a goddess.
- We would fuck 12 times a day.
- Stop it.
I always say shit.
I have a beautiful mind, but when
I spill it -
- shit comes out.
I want to say... 'flower'.
But my mouth says... 'shit'.
I want to say... 'beautiful'.
But it says... 'puke'.
The wrong thing comes out, you see.
I have to find the kids.
Pernille!
It's that thing with my mouth again.
- What?
- What are you doing?
- What?
- What are you doing?
I so wished, that we were two
different people.
I am right here, you idiot!
We are right here, Lars, damn it!
We spoke several times each day.
Anna is taking care of me.
I am not a complete human without her.
Ingvar...
- Mom, aw, I don't want to.
- Mommy!
- We are going home now.
- I don't want to go home.
This is Giant-John and
Flemming Jensen!
- I'll kick him out.
- No.
Wait. Wait.
Hey... Hey. Cheers!
Hey. That's how we have fun here.
That's how we have fun here.
Come on.
That's it. Berit!
- Sign him, up!
- What? Who?
Nigger-Allan. For the beer contest.
- How do you spell it?
- Nigger-Allan. Capital N.
Ingvar, let's call.
Oh no...
No... No...
Anna!
Oh, little Anna...
Is he going for help?
Let me call.
- No, Johannes.
- We have to call for help.
Who do you want to help?
That's it!
We are ready for the final round.
On the stage is Tonser...
We have tiny-Verner...
And in the middle is... Nigger-Allan!
Are you ready for count down.
We go...
Nine... eight... seven... six...
... five... four... three...
two... one!
Drink!
I think we have a winner!
Tonser, ladies and gentlemen!
- He did in five seconds.
- Come on, man!
I think Tiny-Verner is almost
through. 20 seconds.
Now, let's see how Nigger-Allan
is doingn.
Nigger, nigger, nigger...
It was spring...
and summer...
...and autumn...
and then winter...
Three, two, one...YES!
The Lord speaks to us, every day,
Johannes.
Do you never listen to him?
Do you know...?
Anna was an angel. The Lord sent
her to watch over me.
Do you know, what that means?
What does it mean, Ingvar?
What does it mean, Ingvar?
Who watches the demon, now?
- Take it easy, Roald!
- Move.
Fuck you, nigger!
Move.
You fucking little nigger!
Fuck you!
I am dead.
Anna is no longer here...
...and so neither am I.
Only he, who killed us is left.
What remains of Anna is out there...
...in that truck, that killed her.
And in here her killer is
enjoying himself.
- Stupid cunt!
- Brothers.
- I trusted you, man.
- Lars... Lars..?
Lars, damn it!
Lars, stop that.
- Take him, Leif Christensen!
- don't do it.
Ingvar... It is my fault.
I'm sorry, Ingvar, I trusted him.
Tell me what to do.
Only two people could've possible
done it, Lars.
Come on. I DO know how to drive
a truck!
You don't believe, that I...
What is this?
Oh God...
Ingvar! Stop it.
Ingvar, God damn it!
Ingvar! For Christ's sake. Stop it!
No... No! No!
And that taught you nothing.
No! No!
He already confessed.
- Let's find the cops.
- You're terrible. Come on.
- Where are you going?
- The police can get him at my place.
There goes the killer and his friend.
- What did you say?
- Arrogant prick.
Clever, Roald.
And you are a stupid loser.
So just because you are an alcoholic
bums, I need to feel bad?
I spend my entire life avoiding
what you are: a loser.
Fuck you and your early retirement.
- loser right back.
- Fucking asshole.
- Fuck you!
- You are dead!
Fuck. The car.
What?
- You have called the traffic service.
- Taarnfalkevej 1.
- Alain did you hit her?
- There has been an accident.
- I knew it!
- Taarnfalkevej 1. Immediately.
- Please call ff2. This is a wrong...
- Thank you!
They are coming.
This is whipped cream for fuck's sake!
I specifically asked for 'guf',
old fart.
- There is nobody in the beer tent.
- How do they make this canned shit?
- Why aren't they in the beer tent?
- Old jizz? No!
Why?
Why are they not in the beer tent?
They had a tough day. They've been
drinking since 11 this morning.
- 32 here.
- We have a breaking and entering.
We are on our way. Over.
B&E. Lyngbakkerne.
By the summer cottages. Who's
out there now?
He's now sitting in the warm cozy
chair, where Anna was supposed to sit.
He's drinking her coffee and
eating her cake.
Why did he come here?
Why didn't he stay at home?
What specifically was it we
defended with our lifes?
The white cross and the Danish
coastline.
We didn't want the war.
We didn't want the war.
We wanted it gone, and not in
front of our door.
We even sent our children down
there to defend them and theirs.
The cops will take care of him.
The cops will take care of him.
But for them life means...
nothing.
Ingvar. Let them take the nigger.
We have to defend ourselves.
They come up here, and they kill
our women and our children.
We just stand there with our hands
in the pocket.
I say, let's take the damn nigger,
Ingvar.
The Lord is silent.
The Lord is silent.
The Lord gives us the word.
Shall we take it?
- Shall we take it?
- Fuck yes!
- Shall we take it?
- Yes!
That's fine. Like that.
He was carrying this.
- Did you call the police?
- Ingvar broke my phone.
- Leif Christensen made the call.
- Leif Christensen?
We better call again.
Mine is the car.
- What's up, Mr. senior doctor?
- Move, Roald.
What do you think, you are doing
Mr. senior doctor?
Jesus, you stink. You are not
driving in that condition.
Go home. The party is over.
- What do you think, you're doing, huh?
- Thomsen!
- What's going on, Lars?
- Don't touch that phone.
Don't touch that phone, I tell you!
- You better don't call.
- Alright, this is enough.
- It's the vodka, Tonser.
- Are you listening?
Are you not listening to what I'm
saying. Put down the phone!
This is Thomsen. We have a problem...
Fuck. He's bleeding a lot.
He's really bleeding a lot.
Guess he can take care of it
himself.
He is after all a doctor.
Ingvar... please consider this.
- Join him, Johannes.
- Call for help, Ingvar.
He shot at me.
Pernille, calm down.
- Frederik, leave...
- Go to your room, now!
Alain, no, no, no.
Upstairs, come.
Upstairs.
- Are you okay?
- Yes, of course.
Why shouldn't I be alright?
I'm fine.
- Is it good?
- I've seen it about 20 times.
- It has to be...
- What do we do?
They are not coming inside.
They are just not coming inside.
It's completely mental. I think
Thomsen made...
- And the alarm. Somebody will be here.
- And what if they don't?
What?
What has this to do with us?
- It's him they want to talk with.
- I don't see your point.
Must se...? We mustn't...
- Why do we have to...?
- What are you trying to say?
- Why doesn't he talk to them?
- They are going to kill him, damn it!
Stop it!
Stop that!
You are not coming in!
The first one, who shows himself
in the door is done!
- Done?
- Are we done?
I have a nail gun!
He says he has a nail gun.
Watch out, he's building a garage,
if we don't leave.
- Does it hurt?
- Get some tools.
Get some tools!
Ingvar... Let's go home.
Let's go home and call the police.
There are rules, Ingvar.
Not for terrorists.
Go get some gasoline.
What are you doing?
Where are you going with that lamp?
It was a present from Gitte
and Bent.
It's a wedding present.
Have you gone insane?
You are not doing it.
- What are you doing, man?
- Psychopath!
He's insane!
Next.
What the hell is Mr. senior doctor
doingn?
Wasn't he supposed to eat a steak
and drink some Barolo -
- instead of just sitting here
and pissing in the leather furniture?
This is too embarrassing, Mr.
senior doctor.
'I know, Roald'
I'm not offending the Mr. senior doctor
on purpose, but he does looks a little ill.
But what do I know?
I'm nobody.
I'm just Mr. nobody from Rosen.
From down Rosen.
But does the doctor want to
know something?
I don't give a fuck.
It's not me, who's bleeding.
Nothing.
You don't make such a false alarm.
It's not funny.
Hello, Cramer.
Who called? Hmm? I see.
Yes. That's strange.
Hmm. Bye. Thanks.
- What?
- Thomsen called him. Again.
Cramer said, he sounded stressed.
And then a loud noise.
- And then he was gone.
- Gone?
His phone is still on and...
there is rock music in the background.
- Rock music?
- They are tracing the line.
Dad?
I am scared.
Frederik... Frederik.
Do you remember when we were on a boat,
and those big waves were coming?
I told you, that if you get scared,
then the waves will only get bigger.
Frederik. Daddy is taking care of you.
Okay?
Nothing is going to happen, okay?
Daddy is taking care of you.
Frederik?
Come here.
Go to your sister, okay?
Are we all going...?
Are we all going to die for him?
What do you suggest?
- Let's send him out.
- What?
That we send him out.
Those bastards are not coming in.
Alain has not fled those bastards down
there to end with the bastards up here.
At any cost...
I will crush those mother fuckers.
Fucking rednecks!
You like this. You get a kick
out of this.
You are an animal. Just like
them.
Don't do that.
They want him, right?
Ingvar. We want to leave.
The misses wants to beg for
forgiveness.
The misses wants to leave?
The misses wants to beg for forgiveness.
Come here!
Do you know, that you have a
lovely mother?
What's going on here?
Our Father, Who is in heaven.
Holy is Your Name;
Your kingdom come,
Your will be done, on earth as it is in
heaven. Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our sins, as we forgive
those who sin against us;
and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.
This is your kingdom, your power,
your glory.
For all eternity. Amen.
Roald?
Why do you defend him?
That man has buried his family in
Bosnia.
That man came here to find peace.
Did you do anything, Alain?
Tell us where you were this
morning, Alain.
Tell us what happened today
Alain.
Anna just wanted to comfort Alain.
What is he talking about?
So you met Anna on the road?
Alain was walking on the road.
Anna only wanted to comfort me.
Weksjo told, that he was completely
destroyed and left crying.
Ingvar... It was me.
I take the blame.
No, Ingvar. Please don't do it.
- Die!
- He is going to be a father.
Ingvar...
Alain holds Anna tight.
But Anna falls.
Fuck.
Have you got any shells,
Leif Christensen?
Have you got any shells, I ask
you.
Then, go get some in the car.
I am telling you to get some shells
in the car, Leif Christensen!
She is going to have a baby.
A child needs its father.
Pernille?
Frederik?
Pernille!
- I thought this was the road.
- Come here immediately!
Pernille!
Come on, run.
Pernille!
Do as I tell you.
I will be back soon.
Mommy? Mommy?
- Mommy?
- Mommy?
The family fled.
Like many others they didn't know
for what and where.
But sometimes you have to run
from the demons.
Scarlett had a beautiful child.
Pernille and Johannes had no more children.
But they held on to each other
for the rest of their lives.
This is all.
This is all.
