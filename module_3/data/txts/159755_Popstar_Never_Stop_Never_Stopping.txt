Then I would go to, like, a G.
And these are all
just power chords.
Hey, how you doin'?
You're tuned in

Okay, where to start.
Ever since I was born,
I was dope.
Honey!
Oh, my gosh, sweetie!
I loved music.
And as soon as I could,
I started a band
with my two best friends,
Owen and Lawrence.
The Style Boyz.
Right away, people noticed us
because our lyrics
were beautiful
and insightful, poetic even.

The thing about the Style Boyz
is that their chemistry
and their friendship
was really authentic.
You know, you could tell
that they were really friends
with each other.
They were hot.
Before you knew it,
we signed with a major label
and put out our first single,
"Karate Guy."

Kid Contact, he handled
the beats and the music.
Kid Brain, you know,
he did all the lyrics.
And then Conner,
he was the charismatic one,
the one who
brought it all together.
You-you tell me
you didn't see him and say,
"Yo, he's the star."
Things definitely
started to get complicated.
I couldn't help it
if the world chose me.
- Take one.
- You want me to look here?
Pretty funny, right?
Be original,
be fearless.
I love my White Butt Jeans.
As my star kept burning
brighter, some stood by me.
Others couldn't take the heat.
We broke up the next day.
I went solo,
and Owen became my DJ.
Lawrence quit
the music biz altogether.
And our DJ Francis moved
to Japan to hunt dolphins,
like a dickhead.
But it turned out all of that
was just a blessing
in disguise,
because it turned me
into Conner4Real.
I dropped my first album,
and what can I say?
It was a smash.
And I owed it all to my fans,
who I share everything with.
Yo, brushing my teeth.
Yo, I just ate a taco.
It's Conner's Confessions:
Hoverboard Edition.
Oh, fuck!
Dude.
Yo, just got my butt waxed.
That shit hurt!
He's painfully honest
with his fans,
probably too honest, really.
Like, but they love him for it.
Yo.
Just jacked it.
Um, feeling pretty mellow
right now.
- Doinkdedoink.
- Doinkdedoink!
Doinkdedoink!
- Doinkdedoink!
- Doinkdedoink!
I think he's incredible.
He really is the real deal.
My fans and me,
we're in love.
My songs are love letters.
And the arena is our bedroom.
The stage...
The stage is where we fuck.

"I'm So Humble," I instantly
connected with that,
because I'm probably the most
humble person that I know.
Yeah, well, it's a pretty
exciting time right now.
Conner's second album, his
second solo album, CONNquest,
is dropping in two weeks.
And then we go
on the world tour.
- Harry, get in here, man.
- I've been Conner's manager
since back with
the Style Boyz.
It used to be the four of us
riding around in a van,
but, uh, with success,
our family had to get
a little bit bigger.
Sure, Conner surrounds himself
with people who are agreeable.
I wouldn't call them yes men.
Money!
- Did it go in?
- Swish!
Oh, it went in, it went in!
You a murderer, son!
Well, Conner currently
has 32 people
on his personal payroll.
He has a personal assistant,
a party coordinator,
an ab trainer,
basketball coach,
an eyebrow specialist,
sneaker jockey,
two umbrella wranglers,
a weed roller,
a weed holder,
a turtle sitter for Maximus,
scarf caddy,
a guy who punches him in the nuts
- so that he remembers where he came from...
- You're right.
...a perspective manipulator...
Oh, that's a guy who's, uh,
slightly shorter than Conner
who he pays
to stand near him at events
to make him look taller.
You know,
back in my high school days,
I was in a band.
You may heard of them...
called Tony! Toni! Toné! TonEe?
We broke up
over creative differences.
Each Tony had an exclamation
point after their name,
and I thought my name
should have a question mark.
So it would be
Tony! Toni! Toné! TonEe?
In hindsight,
it was not my best decision.
But that led me to Conner.
So who's laughing now?
There you go, buddy.
Ow, dude.
You bit me, Max.
This is my best friend Maximus.
My mom gave him to me
when I was nine years old.
Like, right after my dad died.
I feel like he's, like,
the closest thing
I've ever had to, like,
a little brother or something.
If I had, like, a mute brother
that was hella scaly.
As a hatchling,
the doctors said
that he had been diagnosed
with soggy bones syndrome,
and that he was not gonna
make it past, like, six months.
But that was 20 years ago.
You're my best friend.
Don't tell Owen.
Come on up here. This is
Owen's world right here.
This is where I keep
all my gear.
This is one of the earliest,
uh, synths I ever got.
It's a DX7. This is a classic.
Oh, in Conner's show? No, no.
In Conner's show,
I just use this.
Uh, it's a iPod.
60 gigs, so, you know,
I can fit the entire show,
and, uh, plus, like,
a bunch of dope audio books.
You know?
It was year three at Hogwarts,
and Harry was worried
it would never get any easier.
Harry P.
You know, a lot of people
ask me that.
They say, like, "Is it weird
"for you to be playing
the background now?
'Cause, you know,
you used to be in Style Boyz."
And I always say,
"No, man, not at all, man,
'cause I-I could never do
what Conner does, you know?"
Look, I'm a perfectionist.
My first album sold
four million copies.
So this one has to sell more.
And that's why I take this
so seriously, you know?
And I-I live for this music.
And...
It can't go away.
That's why I personally wrote
every song on this record,
and I used over 100 producers
for just 17 tracks
to guarantee
that they're all hits.
I made a lot of the beats
on the first record,
but on this one, Conner said
he really wanted to branch out.
It's good for him to grow,
you know?
And, also, I played him
a bunch of my beats,
and he was like, "No."
What's up, y'all?
Got a hot new single coming.
And it addresses
some social issues
that I think are being ignored.
So keep your eyes peeled
for that.
We're gonna be
surprise releasing it
next Thursday at noon.
Uh, and that's it.

You know,
like it's not allowed.
It's allowed now.
Usually, I don't like
to read reviews, but...
I'm just excited.
Like, I can't, I can't wait.
I want to know
how people feel about it,
and I want to know
how much they love it, so...
uh, here we go.
Um...
Well, it's Pitchfork, it's...
They gave it a negative review.
No, like, it's a negative four
out of ten...
positive ten, I assume.
Pitchfork can be kind of
pretentious though, so...
But ooh. What?
You ain't gonna knock
my hustle.
Let's look at another one.
Let's pull it up.
Rolling Stone.
Okay.
Um, out of four possible stars,
Rolling Stone has given it...
the shit emoji.
I can only assume it's a, um,
a mess-up, you know?
They must've had a-a problem
with their, um...
No, this seems like
the right score
for how they're saying this.
You know what,
let's just do a search.
CONNquest review.
Oh, here we go.
Here we go.
"CONNquest: a triumph."
That's a good one.
Let me read this.
This is on...
The Onion.
So, you know, mixed.
Let's call it mixed reviews.
So first you're in a group.
You introduced us
to the Style Boyz.
And "Donkey Roll," of course,
we play the hell out of that.
That's a hit for us, man,
and then, Conner,
you get that breakout moment.
You get a phone call
from Claudia Cantrell.
The one and only.
And she asks you
for a verse, man,
on her song,
"Turn Up the Beef."
♪ Turn up the beef ♪
♪ Throw your body
on the flame... ♪
But you take that moment,
and instead of just, like,
kicking a regular verse...
you know what I'm saying...
you did something
a little different.
The "catchphrase verse,"
as it's now known.
Uh-oh, yeah, yeah. Hello.
Um, I had been working
on a catchphrase,
but what had happened was
I just thought
of so many dope ones
that I was like,
"What if I put them
all into the verse?"
♪ Turn up the beef ♪
♪ It's Conner bitch, say word ♪
♪ D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-Dilbert ♪
♪ Doinkdedoink, sorry, Dad ♪
♪ Dinkynuts, squirrel jam,
hats... ♪
Yeah, he said so many words
I didn't know.
That was
a game-changing moment.
There's usually, like,
one catchphrase in a hit.
He dropped, like, 30 on us
in one night. Shit was crazy.
♪ D.J. Tanner, swanky pumps ♪
♪ M-M-Moped music, Costco
samples like a mothafucka ♪
♪ Uuuunngh, crank up the mids ♪
♪ Patrick Stewart money ♪
♪ You know who it is,
Conner4Real. ♪
Immediately, I said,
man, this guy right here,
he's gonna make it big.
Because when you have
a catchphrase,
the world is catched
by your phrase.
You fast-forward.
Things start to happen, man.
You get
the-the Pop Music Award.
And now, here comes those
offers of a solo contract.
Yeah.
How did the other Style Boyz
feel about that?
- You know, they took it fine.
- Mm-hmm.
Owen is my DJ
and my best friend.
- That's good, man.
- And Lawrence
- lives on a farm now, so...
- Hold on.
Lawrence Dunn is a farmer?
My name is Lawrence Dunn.
I used to be in the Style Boyz.
Now I'm a farmer.
Being out here in nature,
away from all the people
and the trappings of
modern life, it's so peaceful.
There's nothing like it.
I've never been happier.
Uh, so yeah, this is, uh,
all my woodwork.
It's kind of my passion,
uh, my hobby.
This is a nice piece.
It's called
"Government in Crisis."
For obvious reasons.
This one's a mask.
Still me.
It's a hat.
You know,
we were going places as a band.
We had plans as a band.
Style Boyz, that's three guys,
not two...
it doesn't work with two.
You know?
It's like a tricycle.
You take away one of
the wheels, what do you got?
Nothin'. A bicycle.
Don't use that.
Look, we had a good run,
you know?
We had a few hits.
But it had run its course,
you know?
It was time for us
to all move on.
Get over it.
When the Style Boyz broke up...
Damn.
The only other time
I remember being that sad...
was when they killed
Josh Charles on The Good Wife.

Uh, I believe "Deborah."

Oh, my God, yes,
that was insane.
I mean, who would want
to listen to music that way?
- Schwag!
- I know it's kind of weird,
but Aquaspin's gonna help us
get the music out there, man.
I mean, so... you don't think
people are gonna have a problem
when music just appears
in their houses?
Look, I know
it sounds lame, but...
there's no such thing
as selling out anymore, man.
This is how big business works.
I mean, nowadays
if you don't sell out,
people will wonder
if nobody asked you to.
- Right.
- But look, dude,
if you're not comfortable
with it,
we could rethink it.
No, man, that's cool,
that's cool.
All right, cool.
Let's get in the car.
This jacket's making me
sweat my ass off.
Yeah, it's fuckin' hot as shit
out here.
Welcome to the car, Conner.
- A.C.!
- Did you say "Macy's"?
- A.C.
- Did you say "Macy's"?
- Air condition.
- Macy's? Macy's?
Sometimes Conner
just gets an idea
and he runs with it, you know?
And he's right,
like, 99.9% of the time, so...
you just got to trust
that he knows what he's doing.
So I understand why he,
you know,
did the whole Aquaspin thing.
Touring is expensive today.
Why you think I do

Okay, could I have
a little separation, please?
Oh, wait, hang on, Gary.
You're not trying to break up

- No, no, no, no.
Just trying to get the logo.
May I... may I touch you?
- Yeah.
- Just slide down just a little bit.
Scoot you down like that.
Little pressure. There we go.
I still see your shadow

♪ Extra. ♪
Ashley Wednesday,
star of the blockbuster
Cube Theorem franchise,
was spotted with pop rapper
Conner4Real
leaving the exclusive
New York City nightclub [bleep]
last night.
Okay, let's go, kids.
- Huh?
- Time to go home in your fun car.
Ash and I have been
hanging out
for about six months now,
and I got to say,
she's the total package.
Well, when I was little,
I would spend hours
looking at famous couples
in magazines...
Us Weekly, People...
and everybody's speculating,
are they a real couple
or are they just for publicity?
And I knew that when I grew up,
I wanted to be
one of those couples.
Five, four,
three, two, one!
Last night,
pop star Conner4Real's
new album CONNquest
was released...
...on all Aquaspin appliances.
Millions of
unsuspecting Americans
- turned on their toasters...
- You can't do that to people!
Yo, Conner4Real,
you suck, dude!
...the president
calling the pop star
"a real dumb [bleep]."
The only reason
he put it in appliances
is 'cause no one
was gonna buy his shit album.
Today on CMZ...
He released his record
with a dishwashing company?
They did this big launch,
and it was all wireless
or something, I don't know,
but it came out of
every appliance in my house,
and I was just like,
"I hate Conner4Real."
For real.
But seriously,
let's be nice to Conner4Real,
'cause he seems like
a good guy.
Uh, I don't think so.
Uh, I don't think so.
Uh, I don't think so.
Come on!
Well, the overnight numbers
were not what
we were expecting.
They were pretty low.
But it's still early.
Yeah, some people were saying
that the Aquaspin thing
was an invasion of privacy,
so it's just a little bump
in the road.
Um... he's dealing with it.
Conner, you okay, buddy?
Maybe the numbers
were wrong, you know?
Like...
BonkoHub had a computer virus
or something.
You know, you could be right.
I'll have Jay look into it.
So what are we talking,
like, 150, 200 or...?
Mm... 65,000.
Well, that is not
where we wanted to be, but...
not bad for the day.
Actually, Conner,
that's for the week.
Estimated.
Sixty-five?
For the week?
Can you... can you...?
Hey, can you guys
give us a second here?
It's the first day
of tour, baby!
Now, I know
Conner's bummin' right now,
but his concert is amazing.
When this thing goes off
and he's out there,
I mean, it's just a spectacle.
It's enormous.
Yeah, my name is, uh, Zippy.
I'm the guitar tech
on the tour.
Shit!
Shit.
I make sure all
the instruments are tip-top.
I love the road, you know.
This is kind of
a perfect job for me,
but my favorite free-time thing
is flatlining.
Heart rate dropping.
Flatlining is when you, uh,
technically
lower your heart rate
until, um... well, you're dead.
- He's still dropping.
- Then you can catch a glimpse
of the afterlife.
Got the idea
from the film Flatliners.
Joel Schumacher film
shot by Jan de Bont.
You know, I try to fit in
a F-line sesh
at least once a week.
...two, one, hit him!
Clear!
Oh, wow.
Did I shit my pants?
Not this time.
To Conner!
To Conner!
My mom means well.
She had her own dreams
of becoming a star
back in the day,
and she gave it up to have me,
so I really owe her for that.
And I'm lucky
to have her support.
- I'll go first.
- Okay, you go first.
Kids first, and then moms.
Oh, my God, that is so fun!
Hello.
My name is Tyrus Quash,

So, these are carrots,

You have your triangles,

like to call it.
Julienne.
I think that's how they say it.

and it brings me great joy
to see him love
the treats that I prepare.

First of all,
this is an 18,000-seat arena.
Nobody sells this out.
You sold 15,000 seats.
That's still really good.
No, it's not good.
Hammerleg sold this place out
last week!
Well, Aquaspin agrees with you.
They're concerned
about ticket sales.
What? But it's
an 18,000-seat place.
Nobody sells that out.
Hammerleg did. Last week.
Look, the low record sales
are making them nervous.
They want to bring on
an opening act.
What? We have an opening act.
Owen deejays.
Hey, I'm always saying
Style Boyz could be the opener.
No, man.
Will you stop with that?
Dude, people keep
blowing up my Twitter
about us doing "Donkey Roll."
- Oh, they're blowing up your Twitter?
- Yeah.
How many followers
do you have, Owen?
- Like, 500,000.
- Okay, well, I got 20 million,
and no one's asking me
to do that shit, so...
Hey-oh!
Some of those
are probably bots.
Okay, look, guys, regardless,
we still have to decide
on an opening act.
Man.
All right, fine.
Does anybody have ideas?
One, but you are gonna like it.
Wait, did you say "are"

Hey, look, man,
Conner got all the way to the
top of this business, you know?
And the higher you get,
the harder you fall.
- I mean, ask any coconut.
- Thing is is that
Conner's never been as good
as he was with the Style Boyz.
Whatever him and Lawrence
were beefing over,
they need to figure out
a way to squash it.
Ever since Style Boyz broke up,
Lawrence has been mad at me.
He claims he wrote
my famous catchphrase verse.
Translation:
He's a jealous-ass hater
who's mad that I blew up
and he's a farmer
out in bum-fuck nowhere.
But, you know,
we all have our take.
Uh, this one here,
this is my Poppy.
Uh, it's what I got
for writing Conner's famous
catchphrase verse.
If you look close, you'll
notice that it's not real,
because I didn't get a Poppy
or credit of any kind.
But there is one person that
I absolutely have to thank,
and that person is me!
Me, myself and I!
I did it all by myself!
Nobody helped me!
So...
Yeah.
That's my Poppy.
If he's so great,
how come he's not
making anything, you know?
Nothing's stopping him
from going out
and writing a bunch of hits.
After the Style Boyz,
I tried some solo projects,
but none of them
really took off.

I didn't really relate
to that song,
because, you know, I-I had
different things in my Jeep
than he had in his Jeep.
I don't think
Conner's living real life.
I think he's in a bubble
with people
telling him
what he wants to hear
and kissing his ass all day.
I heard he's getting
into stage gimmicks now.
He's got Owen in a helmet,
looking dumb.
And one where he sings
from a toilet.
Someone should've told him
that shit's wack,
but he's so afraid of failure,
man, he's just
getting desperate.
Let's try it again.
Oh! Oh, it snagged!
What's up, my confidants?
Be sure to come through
to my show tonight.
I'm trying
a brand-new magic trick.
You know, they said
it couldn't be done,
that the trick was designed
for a woman,
and my junk would get
all tangled.
But I figured out
how to solve it.
I think if I just
tuck it all back...
See ya tonight.
Let's go!
Hey!
What is this, y'all?
I said upscale.
You took me to outer space.
What do you say
we take it back down to Earth?
What?
This almost looks like
something that a cowboy
might wear.
Are y'all looking at my chaps?
But enough horsing around.
Let's take things uptown.
How about a good
old-fashioned tuxedo?
There is no substitute.
Top of the world!
- Oh, shit.
- Where is it?
No, uh, no.
It's tucked. I...
I shaved for the trick!
- Don't post those pics!
- As they approached
- the edge of the Dark Forest...
- It's an illusion.
It's tucked, I tuck it back.
Conner, just hold on.
Don't post those.
It's a tuck-and-tape!
I don't know what to do
right now.
I want to show y'all my dick,
but I can't show you my dick!
It's a great conundrum.
It's a great conundrum!
Holy shit, dude, where the fuck
was your dick, dawg?
What happened out there?!
What happened to the trick?
Conner, don't worry.
Nobody saw anything.
I wish they had seen something!
Now there's 10,000 people
that think I got no dick!
Wait, you guys know
I have a dick, right?
- Yeah. It's just...
- You do. You-you do.
- Yes.
- I've always believed you had a dick.
R-Right, right, right,
but, like, where was it though?
Because that motherfucker
was gone.
We've gone over this. I...
You know I got to tuck
my shit back
so it doesn't get tangled up
in the garments.
- Yeah, that makes perfect sense.
- Of course.
Got to put it
in between the legs.
Conner, don't worry about it.
You were up there
for, like, ten seconds.
Ten seconds is
an eternity, Harry!
It's a third
of the way to Mars!
Conner, we've talked
about this.
30 Seconds to Mars
is the name of a band.
It's not a fact.
Hey, look, thank you, dawg,
because this shit
was hilarious, fam!
Well, I'm so glad that I could
entertain you, Hunter.
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about this, would you?
Ah. I wish.
This is, like,
genius prank shit right here.
Next level.
You would have to be
the best prankster of all time
to think of something
like this.
And, well, shit, that's...
shit, that's me.
Maybe I did do it.
Nah, I didn't do it.
Or did I?
Nah, I didn't.
Or maybe I did.
Not. Do it.
- Did you?!
- I didn't do it.
Or I did.
Who knows?! I don't!
Conner, don't worry,
don't worry.
This is not news.
Don't post those!
What the fuck?!
The timing of that was crazy!
- Conner dickless?
- They should call him
NoDick4Real.
It was tucked, Linda.
It's part of the show.
- No, no, don't print that!
- Everywhere I look.
This is insane.
Now it's on the front page
of USA Today,
the most respected newspaper
in the world?
Sweetie, relax.
All we need is
a different story
- to wipe it out of the press cycle.
- Mm-hmm.
Okay, so what? What do we do?
Anything.
Uh, release a new single.
Get a crazy haircut.
Or, uh, take an ugly teenager
to the prom.
All good ideas.
Let's keep thinking about it.
And I'm gonna go tweet
a picture of my dick.
Okay, don't really do that.
Ah, man,
I just think it's gonna really
change people's perception
of me
in a good, positive way.
And also, I'm really glad
about the fact
that we'll get married, too,
'cause I like her so much.
Conner, what's going on?
You'll see.
Oh, my God, is that music?
Yeah.
Almost there. And...
Uh-huh?
- You ready?
- Mm-hmm.
Are those real wolves?
Yeah.

that in my previous life,
I was a wolf.
Which makes so much sense.

I caught a little bit
of this obscure old movie
called The Parent Trap,
right?
And in that movie, these two
little redheaded girls,
they get the idea to trick
their divorced parents
into falling back in love
with each other.
So I was like, yo,
if I just get
Lawrence and Conner

boom, they're gonna realize
that they're friends,
and we all
can all be buddies again.

Oh! It's a dick!
That's one of your fans, man.
Go for it.
- Ooh!
- Can you make it out to Jenna?
- Oh, hello.
- That's me.
It's nice to meet you.
- That's my fiancé's penis.
- Ah.
- Big fan.
- Thanks, man. So tight.
Okay, he's inside.
I'm just gonna...
...do the old John Hancock.
Are you guys getting
back together? Style Boyz?
- No.
- No. Right on.
- We're thinking about it.
I'm gonna roll
the window up now, so just...
Thanks for coming by.
- Great to meet you guys.
- I rest my case, Lawrence.
You think you know what's up,
but in fact,
you, my friend,
have no idea what's going on.
Don't call me again.
Lawrence, dude.
Don't leave like that.
Shit.
We should probably hit
the car wash.

Finally heard back
from the Poppies.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. They-they love you.
Um, they just...
they just don't have
enough room for you this year.
What? For real?
Yeah, it's a bummer. I know.
I told them to keep us in mind

It could come around.

- All right, Harry, we got to talk.
- I know.
- That was a mess out there tonight.
- Yeah.
We have to get rid of Hunter.
We can't fire Hunter, Conner.
I mean, he's one of the reasons
that the tour sold out.
I want him off the tour.
Well, look, he's number one
on BonkoHub right now.
Well, what number are we?
Numbers don't matter.
Come on, you know that.
- God.
- Hey, could we talk about this helmet?
- It's crazy heavy, and it's really hurting my back.
- Owen,
why are you talking right now?
Why are you in this meeting?
I'm in all of our meetings.
Dude, just leave, all right?
Go have a meeting
with Lawrence.
You know, it's not my fault
that the album's
not selling, okay?
Don't take it out on me.
Great.
Harry, we have to get rid
of Hunter, all right?
I'm not asking, I'm telling.
You represent me, not him.
Okay, look, well, actually...
technically...
Full disclosure:
I represent both of you.
What?
Yeah.
You signed him?
Conner, come on.
Are you kidding me, Harry?
It's just business.
It's not to me!
All right, look,
decide right now, him or me.
Come on, don't go there.
Look, I got a family to feed.
What? No, you don't!
- I have a niece.
- We all have a niece!
You know what?
You're fired.
Conner, you... you're just...
you're upset
and you're overreacting.
Okay, now I got
to collate that.
Great. Have fun collating.
There's no fun in collating!
What's up, my confidants?
Who can you really trust?
I thought
I could trust my manager,
but it turned out
he was stabbing me in the back
the whole time.
I thought I could trust Seal.
I thought I could trust
the Yelp reviews
of PartyWolves.com.
Really makes you think,
doesn't it?
Who's out there,
scheming behind my back,
trying to take what I built?
I need to find out
who I can really trust.
All right, y'all,
come and get 'em!
- Conner's fancy flapjacks! Right here!
- Whoa!
Wow!
Thanks, Conn.
Eat up, eat up, eat up, eat up.
- Mm!
- Sponge,
you liking those pancakes?
- They're so good. Yeah.
- Yeah.
Eddie? Feeling these?
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.
Dude, I'm sorry.
I can't.
Conn, these are terrible, man.
I'm really sorry.
Thank you, Owen.
Truly.
- Okay.
- And the rest of you liked them?
Yeah.
Yup. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Well... that's
very disappointing,
because they are not good.
- I knew it.
- And the reason they're not good
is because
I put dog shit in them.
- What?!
- Aw, dang, dude!
- That's nasty!
- Oh, that's... hilarious.
The reason that I did that
is to see
who would tell me the truth!
Oh... Conn, that's mad smart!
- Yeah, he's always two steps ahead.
- No.
No, stop doing that, you guys.
This is what I'm talking about.
You can't just agree
- with everything I say.
- No doubt, no doubt, no doubt.
- It's not helpful.
- Got to be honest.
No, you're doing it again,
all right? Just stop!
You fed us dog shit?
- What is wrong with you?!
- Owen, chill out, man.
You're the only one who
passed the test. You're good.
How the fuck can you think I
was one of your lackeys, dude?
I'm your oldest friend.
- Hey, we're friends!
- We're all friends.
I should've told you
to fuck off years ago,
but instead
I just let you become
- a bigger and bigger dick.
- Look, I'm sorry,
but I've kept you on the tour,
I keep you paid,
I put food on the table!
With dog shit in it!
It's the thought
that counts, man!
Oh, my God, that's it.
I quit.
You can't quit.
What do I even do anymore,
Conner?
I push play on an iPod
in a robot costume.
All right, fine, then.
Go.
Fine.
Fine.
Fine.
Maximus?
I'm home, buddy.
Sometimes he kicks it in here.
Max!
You hear that?
Max?
What are you doing?
What's wrong with you?
Why are you all white?
Why is he making that sound?
Oh! Oh, fuck!
There's something wrong
with Maximus!
His scales are all ashy.
Come on!
No! Get out of the way!
Move! Come on!
Please, please move!
My turtle is sick!
I got to get him
to the hospital!
He's gonna die!
Maximus...!
As I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,
I take a look at my life and
realize there's nothing left.
Maximus was my best friend,
who struggled daily
with soggy bone syndrome,
but never complained once.

Congratulations.
You played yourself.
You guys win.
I get the message.
I'll go away.
This is Conner4Real
signing off.
So, I am back in Sac,
house-sitting for my mom,
- 'cause she's on tour
- Oh, shit.
- with Fallout Boy.
- You guys filming me?
- It's been awesome, you know?
- Oh.
Dude, which one of y'all
pissed on me?
Feels really good to reconnect with my hometown.
I've just been really living
a very simple life.
Kind of... back to basics.
I've been watching
a lot of dressage,
which is a very elevated,
uh, competitive form
of horse dancing.
I've been doing
a lot of painting
and a lot of sketching.
Um, I'm doing a series
on show ponies.
I actually have a lot
of trouble with the hooves.
It's hard to get, like,
a hoove texture.
This one is, like,
pretty accurate, actually.
I'll show you guys the horse
that I based it on. Anyway...
It's not my best one.
Um, like, in retrospect,
I probably wouldn't have used
- that shade of green.
- I've even been selling
some of them online,
which has been a cool,
new experience.
Ooh! Sold.
- 11.50.
- You know, it's not
Conner4Real numbers, you know?
But in a way it means more.
That's pretty much it,
you know?
That's my life now.
Hello.
Hey! What's up, dude?
You guys, Paula's here!
What's going on?
Just wanted to check up on you.
You want a drink?
Uh, no. It's 11:00.
It's 11:00 in the morning.
It's 11:30 somewhere.
Go! Touchdown...
Can we please turn this off?
Look at those little nerds!
We were very cool
for our school district.
My birthday is awesome.
Yeah, man, we used to have fun.
What the fuck happened?
Okay.
Oh, shit.
I think this is the day
that my mom gave me Maximus.
Oh.
This one is from...
Owen and Lawrence!
A turtle! A turtle!
- Oh, my goodness!
- Look, Mom! They got me a turtle!
What do you say, sweetie?
Thank you!
You're welcome.
Honey,
what are you gonna name it?
I'm gonna name it Maximus.
Get up. We're going out.
What?
Oh, no, I'm not going out.
I cannot deal with the public
right now.
Conner, it's not a question.
All right, fine.
But if we're going out...
I got to put on my makeup.
Please don't put that on.
This is cool.
Feels good to be out.
- You were right. Yeah.
- Good.
I'm glad I did this though.
You know, it makes me feel
more comfortable, more at ease.
I feel at ease.
- Yeah, you look really comfortable.
- Yeah.
You look like Matthew Modine
had a peanut allergy.
All right.
You look like Nazi propaganda.
Okay, that's foul.
Wait a minute.
That piano part is incredible!
♪ Earth, wind and birds ♪
♪ They sit around my park ♪
♪ Up with ♪
♪ Darkness so cold. ♪
Was my last album bad?
I feel like I probably could've
handled myself a little better
over the past few months.
It feels so nice to be able
to say all this shit,
'cause the music is so loud
no one can hear me!
That equal rights song
was offensive!
I feel free!
Thanks for coming out, you guys.
- Means a lot.
- Great show, Kid Contact!
Conner?
Aw, man!
How'd you recognize me?
What's up, man?
What are you doing here?
Had to put on the disguise,
right?
Yeah, no, I see that.
Come check out
my homie do his thing, man.
Great show!
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah, yeah.
Oh. Paula brought you?
She did.
And I'm really glad she did.
It was such a great show.
You sounded incredible, dude.
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah. Yeah.
I mean, my singing's terrible,
but, you know.
What? No! No...!
But, I mean, all right, look,
may be time
for some vocal lessons,
you know? No shame in that.
Yeah, or you know
who would sound better on it.
Clay Aiken.
No. You.
No. No, man.
This is your thing, and
I'm hella proud of you, man.
And...
fuck, man, I just...
- I want to just say I'm sorry.
- Conner, just, I...
like, I love that
you're doing this right now,
but it's really hard
to take you seriously,
because you just look like
Jason Segel right now.
- Oh, Paula said that.
- Well, we have great minds.
- Yeah, that's funny.
- Yeah, it must, like...
- How is it, like...?
- Oh, yeah, it's, like,
- the spitting image of, like...
- Is that good? Like...
Yeah, it looks identical
to that dude.
Sarah Marshall.
I need to forget about her.
- Yeah, he needs to forget her.
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Love that movie.
- Yeah.
Thanks, man.
It means a lot
that you came out.
I'm glad I came, too. For real.
That's good, man.
Nice.
What the fuck?
One of you guys put this here?
Hey, Lawrence.
Conner.
Owen.
Lawrence.
Conner.
Just...
That's for you, man.
To borrow, you know?
Figured...
you could take a bunch of pics
of you holding it and stuff,
you could post them
or whatever.
All right? So...
...now we're cool.
Lawrence!
What the fuck, man?
Now I got to go find that!
What do you want me to say?
That you helped
with the catchphrase verse?
Is that what this is
still about?
Fine. You helped with the
catchphrase verse. All right?
You happy?
All right,
and you wrote most of it.
But using my catchphrases.
That you also cowrote.
All right, wrote.
But we were both in the room,
and I dictated
all the best stuff.
All right,
none of the best stuff, dude,
but I had tons of great ideas
that I still don't even know
why you didn't use them.
Because they sucked!
Okay, fine. That's my bad.
But I was there
the whole time, man.
I was a little late.
I was a little late that day.
There was traffic,
and I was a little tardy
on that particular day.
There was no traffic.
I lied about that.
I lied about it because
I overslept on accident.
It was on purpose.
It was a power move.
I was trying to send a message,
and that was
a dick move on my part,
all right?
However, once I got there...
late...
I put in time, okay?
I left a little early,
I remember that.
I was never there.
Now I remember.
I remember now what happened!
I bailed, and you wrote
the whole verse.
You wrote it,
and I never gave you credit.
'Cause guess why.
No one cares who writes shit.
They just care who performs it.
In fact, I think the only
person in the whole universe
who cares about the credit
for who wrote it is you!
Fuck.
I'm sorry.
Boom.
Parent Trap.
What'd you say
you grew here again?
You'll see.
Oh, shit!
Lawrence,
how much weed do you have?
Hey, everyone, I'm gonna take
the rest of the day off
to hang out with my friends.
Keep up the good work, and...
- let's have a great harvest.
- Okay!
- You guys still smoke?
- Yeah.
- Cheers, dude.
- Cheers.
Witch's Titty, Aqua Butt,
Beethoven's Nightmare,
Postpartum Depression,
Frog Jizz, Purple Durban...
- It's really up there, man.
- Good shot there, Lawrence.
All right, one, two, three.
- Oh.
- Got it?
- Get it.
- Ah! Ha-ha!
- Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah.
No way this works.
- Get it.
- No. No!
- Yeah.
- You smoked the Poppy, dude!

that was, like...

♪ Or just avoiding me? ♪
That was it.
♪ Either way's a bummer ♪
♪ But I hope you're dying... ♪
- That was messed up. He wrote that.
- Yeah.
Pretty fun in there, man.
I forgot how fun it is.
Kind of makes me think
that I fucking hate farming.
I look at Conner,
and I see that
seven-year-old scrub
that I grew up with, and...
it's like, how could you
be mad at a seven-year-old?
It's crazy I spent so much time
thinking about killing him.
You guys see that?
You missed me!
Oh, fuck!
Conner's full of surprises
these days, man.
I mean,
on our way from the airport,
I actually noticed
something crazy.
I looked down, and in his bag
he had this book
called
How to Be a Better Friend.
It was all dog-eared
and scribbled on.
It feels like
he's really trying.
And plus, it shows
he knows how to read,
which is really heartening.
I can't believe we remembered that, man.
Paula's calling you.
Yo, there was
a whole second verse
- in that, too, remember that?
- Yeah, what was it, dude?
- I'm gonna grab it, I'm gonna grab it.
- Okay.
- You remember that?
- Yeah.
Yo.
Where the hell have you been?
Um, hanging with the guys.
It's actually been
super fun, man.
Conner, you just got offered
the Poppy Awards.
Wait, what?
The Poppy Awards!
Taylor Swift was arrested
for murder.
They want you
to close the show.
It is a huge spot.
Six minutes to do
whatever you want.
But they need an answer now.
Oh, shit. Um...
This is what we've been
waiting for, Conner!
♪ She never wore socks... ♪
But that was
the third verse though.
- I'm talking about the second verse.
- Okay.
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Like, what was the second verse?
♪ Her daddy hates me ♪
♪ 'Cause my car ♪
- ♪ Is slick. ♪
- Yes!
- Okay.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Let's record it.
- Oh, hell yeah.
- Let me get on the boards.
- What did Paula want, man?
Oh, nothing. They wanted me
to do the Pop Awards,
but I passed on it.
- Yo, what?
- Dude, I don't want
to do that shit.
I'm hanging with you guys.
Who fucking cares, dude?
That's the Poppies.
All right, but I thought
this was, like,
the whole reason
you guys were mad at me,
for going and doing
all this solo shit.
Dude, you don't have to choose
between us and your solo shit.
It's like with Wu-Tang Clan.
It's like,
you're Method Man,
and he made a solo record,
but he's still
in the Wu-Tang Clan.
He never stopped
being in the Wu-Tang Clan.
- Right.
- Or, like, the GZA.
He was in the Wu-Tang Clan,
and then he made a solo record.
He never stopped being
in the Wu-Tang Clan.
Yeah. Or you're the RZA,
and you could do
your solo shit,
but you're still
in the Wu-Tang Clan.
So basically...
we're the Wu-Tang Clan.
Exactly. But better.
Yeah. Well...
As soon as I said it, I was
kind of like, uh, maybe not.
It's like
we're three Tom Pettys
and we're the Heartbreakers,
you know?
You're a Tom Petty,
you're Tom Petty,
and I'm Tom Petty,
but together...
- We're Tom Petty.
- ...we're the Heartbreakers.
- Oh, right, no.
- We're the Heartbreakers.
- Yeah, I lost it, too.
- Yeah.
We know you got to fly.
You're like a beautiful bird...
you got to be
out there,
you got to see it all,
but we can be
right there with you,
as your little bird legs.
So you think I should...
do the Pop Awards?
- Fuck yes!
- Yeah.
All right, well,
I'm not going alone.
Who are you gonna do it with?
- With you guys!
- Oh.
- Do you want to come with me?
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah, yeah.
- That's tight.
- I was wondering who you were gonna...
- All right.
- We're so high!
- That's tight.
And the stars are arriving
for this year's
Pop Music Awards, the Poppies.
Good. Let's go.
You guys are all set.
They know you're doing
one Style Boyz song,
and then we're gonna go into
Conner's, uh, new single.
Great.
Oh, shit!
Conner, what up though, dawg?
- Oh. Yeah, what up, Hunter?
- Yo, yo, yo, yo.
Say hey to my doc
real quick, baby.
- Hi.

Hey, you got a doc,

You know what I'm saying?
But now...
like, I'm rolling with all
these dudes and with Aquaspin.
Like, I kind of

- Anyway, though, my man.
Good to see you, man.
You looking spiffy, you know?
Yo, yo, this Hunter, dawg.
I'm 'bout to get crazy
- on this stage, baby.
- Oh, no, sorry, not your camera.
- Huh?
- We're with Conner.
Oh, shit. My bad.
Yo, this Hunter
about to head into the Poppies,
you know what I'm saying?
No, sorry. We're with Snoop.
Surprise, mothafucka!
You're watching
my brand-new show:
Surprise Mothafucka
with Snoop Dogg.
And, mothafucka,
you've been surprised.
Excuse me.
- Excuse me, baby.
- Hey, hey, okay, hey.
Can somebody move out the...
Hey, Mariah Carey.
Your hair smells
and looks great.
Did you know Aquaspin has
hair dryers and flatirons?
No, I didn't.
Aquaspin appliances
are completely affordable
for college students.
Honey, you're not
doing ads now.
- Really? What?
- Read the damn prompter.
Yo, you're messing
with my money right now.
- What the [bleep] did you just say to me?
- What?
Yo, [bleep] all y'all,
all right?
And [bleep] everybody else.
And [bleep] Mariah Carey
for leaving me up here.
- Yeah, I said her.
- Okay, say it again.
No, oh, you still here?
I thought you had left.
Style Boyz?
It's time.
Yo, what the fuck
was that, Harry?
Why you got me up there
saying that bullshit, man?
I told you not
to say it. You're the one
who wanted to cash the check.
Yo, you set me up, dude!
You ain't nothing but, like,
a fake, sellout, money-hungry
pop, bullshit-ass manager!
You ain't nothing but a Tony!
Toni! Toné! reject, bitch!
What the fuck you say to me?!
Say that shit again,
young blood!
I will eat your head!
I will eat your fucking head!
You better learn some respect!
Yo, all right. Hey, man.
I'm sorry, yo. Chill.
Old-ass motherfucker.
- Oh!
- Shit.
Why you hit me like that, dawg?
Get yourself a new manager!
Yo, are you serious?
What the hell, man?
Oh, my God.
That was great, Harry!
- It was insane, wasn't it?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
I was like,
"Hey, get some respect."
You know.
Wow.
Hey, look, Harry,
I just want to say I'm sorry...
No, don't.
Don't worry about it.

There you are. Look,

so you only have
three minutes now.
- What?
- Yeah, you can only do one song,
so I need to know,
are you gonna do Conner4Real

- Uh...
Yeah, no, I asked him.
He's just kind of, like,
looking off into space
and, like, really making a meal
out of this.
And now I'm just
standing here waiting.
He's looking off to,
like, contemplate
whether he should, I think,
pick the Style Boyz,
'cause he's, like,
looking in their direction.
So he might be leaning
toward that kind of choi...
No, he's looking back.
So I-I'm lost. I'm not sure
which one he's gonna go for.
All right.

Amazing.
Just full of

Yo, and then Conner had

the motherfucking Style Boyz.
This is just
some revolutionary shit, man.
My heart is pounding right now.

Yes! Yes! Fuck!
Yes!
I just performed
the "Donkey Roll"
with the Style Boyz.
I was a Style Boy.
When I walked out onstage,
all I could think of was,
I'm so happy.
And I really hope that
Tony! Toni! Toné! is watching.
And that they feel like shit.
A wise man once said,
"Everyone's career
is on a wave.
"Sometimes you're up,
sometimes you're down.
"But the trick is not to
lose yourself along the way.
And when you're up,
don't be an asshole about it."
It's like my mom always says...
Yo, what the fuck?
That stage manager lady just
macked on Lawrence super hard.
Yo, do they even
know each other?
Oh, my God!
And why is De-bor-ah here?
Anyways, be cool
to your friends, right?
That's what I was saying?
Yo, they are gonna fuck!
Damn that is hilarious.
But the point is,
be a good person,
and the rest
will fall into place.
And that's Conner4Real.
Isn't that right, Maximus 2?
It sure is, Conner.
What?
He wasn't really talking.
That was me doing the voice.

The Style Boyz are
getting back together again!
Yeah, they broke up,
then they buried the hatchet,
and now I guess
they're working together again.
- They're, like, friends from childhood.
- Yeah!
- For life!
And they had,
like, tough times,
and now they feel good about
being back together.
- Yeah.
- We're gonna put aside our differences!
And actually do something.
Because sometimes
I think about doing that.
- Yeah.
- I haven't talked to my mom
in three years.
I moved out here,
I thought I could get, like,
a commercial agent.
I just wanted to be
a longboard model.
I never graduated high school.
I never graduated
middle school.
It'd be a lot of fun
if the four of us hung out
outside of the office.
Hey, guys, can I ask you
something really...
that I've never
really asked you before?
- Yeah.
- Do you guys have a photograph
of James Franco
leaving a Denny's?
Oh, yeah! Totally!
It's right here!
- Let's see it!
- Put it up!
Bring it up!
We got it!
