SERGEANT:
Guard...
...halt.
Color guard, halt.
Regiment...
...dismissed.
CADET:
We did it! We did it!
You made it.
MAN: Congratulations.
You've got a fine boy there.
MAN: Deliveries in the rear.
HAWK: I'm here to pick up Cadet Cutler.
MAN: Okay. Pass, sir.
HAWK: Thanks.
Who's he?
MAN:
Smile, everybody.
Who brought him here?
MAN: Excuse me, please.
Can I get you to pay attention?
Forget about him. Pay attention to me.
I'm trying to get a picture here.
Okay, smile.
CADET: Oh, thanks, Dad.
Hey, are we gonna get to see Mom?
- Is this the Michael Cutler limo?
- Yes, sir. Afternoon, sir.
- Where's my grandfather?
- He'll arrive at the airport in an hour.
CADET: Cutler!
- Yes, sir!
CADET: The colonel wants to see you.
- Right away, sir! Wait here.
WOMAN:
There they are. Hi.
WOMAN: Colonel Gimley.
CADET: Sir.
The colonel wishes to see me, sir.
Your father wishes to, cadet.
- My father?
COLONEL: Yes.
- He's come to drive you home.
- Hello, Mike.
I don't have a father, sir.
COLONEL:
This is your father, Michael.
Sir, my grandfather instructed me
to go home with no one...
...besides himself or my mother.
Your mother has legal custody over you,
Cutler, not your grandfather.
And it is her request
that your father bring you home.
- Sir, may I ask a question?
- Of course.
May I see some identification
on this man, sir?
That's not called for, cadet.
That's okay. I'm ready.
Are we going in this? Why can't we fly?
Your mother thought it would be a good
way for us to get to know each other.
How long will it take?
Well, I have one more pickup...
...and, say, two, three days,
we'll be in California.
And your mother doesn't go into surgery,
say, until Wednesday morning.
Do you really think you can make up
10 years in two to three days?
No.
- Let me help you.
- I can do it myself.
- I'd like to say something, sir.
- Sure.
This truck is disgusting.
Oh, I don't know, Mike. It's just old.
- Once, on a stretch up to Vegas, this thing-
- Sir.
There's no need to make any conversation
for my sake.
So much for small talk.
Okay, here we go.
- Can I ask you a question, sir?
- Sure.
How did you get
all these pictures of me?
Well, your mother sent them to me.
- Why?
- I've been writing to her for a long time...
...and I asked her for pictures
so I could see how you were growing up.
Looks good.
If you had been writing for a while,
how come I never got a birthday card...
...or a letter or anything?
- What are you saying, Mike?
- I'm saying I never heard from you.
Mike, I've written to you 100 times.
Birthdays- All the time.
What do you mean I never-?
You must have sent them to the wrong
address because I never got anything.
Sir, could you pull over,
I'm feeling sick.
- What's wrong?
- Would you please pull over, sir?
Hey! Mike?
- Mike!
MAN 1: Look out!
- Mike!
MAN 2: Hey, what the hell are you doing?!
HAWK: Mike!
MAN 3: Put a leash on that kid!
Mike, Mike, stop. Stop!
Mike!
Mike, Mike, stop it. Stop it.
Stop it. Mike.
- Stop it.
- I hate you.
Then hate me.
We have to start someplace.
Okay?
Come on, let's go back.
- I thought you took care of it.
- I did, Mr. Cutler, but-
- Forget it.
- Yes, sir.
The boy's mother called, Mr. Cutler.
She insisted Michael leave
with his father.
Don't you understand?
My daughter is in no condition
to make that kind of a decision.
And I didn't fly all the way up here
to be simply told...
...you turned my grandson over
to that worthless bastard.
I can't tolerate stupidity.
I'll bring this up
to the attention of the board.
I'm sorry about-
I'm sorry about the jacket.
It's no problem. You'll get the bill.
I'm sure.
You know, if you're hungry,
there's a great place up here for good steak.
What do you say we stop?
Sir, you're going to be a victim
of cholesterol poisoning.
Later in life, you'll just start to rot away.
You're just full of good humor,
aren't you, Mike?
Well, let's try it anyway.
HAWK:
Okay.
MAN:
Hey, Linc.
- How you doing, Tom?
- Just fine.
- You hook me up?
- No problem.
Let's eat, Mike.
WAITRESS:
Didn't you say you wanted a burger?
MAN:
Hey, Linc, good to see you, man.
How do you like this place, Mike?
I never did like the zoo, sir.
Sit down.
- Hey, Linc. Hi, how you doing?
- Fine. Martha, this is my kid, Mike.
- Well, Mike.
- How do you do, ma'am?
Ma'am? Whoo!
I like that.
So, what'll it be?
A couple of big steaks, Linc?
For me. Mike will have chicken.
- All right, bird. Sure.
- No. Excuse me.
For a man who exercises,
you don't know much about nutrition.
Fried chicken
with mashed potatoes and gravy...
...contains about 1000 calories
and 50 percent fat.
These fats have been linked
to heart disease and some cancer.
So, what would you like?
Tuna salad, whole-wheat toast
and spring water with lemon, please.
MARTHA:
Okay.
- Double that.
WAITRESS: Two beers, coming up.
MARTHA:
All right.
If you want, we can go to McDonald's.
You Hawk?
- If you're hungry-
- I said, are you Hawk?
- What can I do for you?
- I'm the Smasher.
That's a nice name.
All I've been hearing on the road lately
is this Hawk is the man to beat.
- You can't believe everything you hear.
- I don't believe anything!
I got 1000 that says
I can tear your arm off.
- You want it?
MAN 1: Yeah, yeah, go on.
MAN 2:
He's trying to back out.
I said, you want it?
Why not?
All right, let's get this table ready.
I wanna show this guy something.
- Break his arm off.
- Are you gonna fight that guy?
- I can't talk right now, Mike.
- Where you going?
Gotta go to work.
MAN:
Come on, Linc.
- What are you doing with that guy?
- He's my father.
Too bad.
MAN: All right, Tony! Start the fight!
Start the fight, Tony!
TONY:
Get ready.
Get ready. Go!
You ain't got it.
Get him, Linc!
Come on, Linc, get him! Get him!
Yeah!
MAN:
You can do it!
Come on, you can do it. Come on.
Over the top! Come on, over the top!
TONY:
Come on, Linc! Come on, Linc!
Good match.
Come on, jerk, give me the money.
Give me the money!
MAN: I ain't giving you money.
TONY: Listen, you little punk...
Wise guy here.
- So you got lucky again, huh, Hawks?
- How you doing, Bull?
Better than you.
Right now, double or nothing.
What do you say?
You should just wait for Vegas.
Come on, do it now.
I feel like kicking some ass.
HAWK: Let's wait till Vegas, okay?
- You ain't got a prayer in Vegas.
We'll see.
Too bad your old man's yellow, kid.
I'll see you in Vegas.
Get out of the way. Back up.
I'm sorry about that, Mike.
You know, you're a hustler.
You hustled that man back there for money.
- No.
- I'd like to call my mother.
CHRISTINA:
You have to give it time, Michael.
You have to be patient.
I know how you feel,
but you must do it. It's important.
I know you want me to,
but I don't even know him.
I want you to try. It's important to me.
Why? I thought everything was fine.
There's so much more to life
than what you've seen, honey.
- But he left you.
- He had his reasons.
Look, I have to go now,
but I wanna talk to your father first, okay?
- I love you.
- Okay, I love you too. Bye.
- She wants to talk to you.
- Thanks.
How you doing, honey?
Excuse me.
Mike, could you hold that? Thank you.
Hi, honey, how are you?
Yeah, we're having a great time.
Yeah, he's very helpful.
Matter of fact,
he's helping me right now.
That was a nice song.
Mike, I think we're wearing out
this knob here.
Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.
- Are you still dealing drugs, sir?
Are you?
- You think of that all by yourself, Mike?
- My grandfather gave me the facts.
The truth is, I never did what
your grandfather said I did, Mike.
Only mistake I ever made was leaving.
I admit that.
So how did you like
the arm-wrestling match back there?
It was an experience.
It sure was.
Christina.
How are you, darling?
- Are you angry with me?
- Angry?
I've never been angry with you.
Tell me the truth.
All right, I'll tell you the truth.
I'm not angry.
But I am disappointed.
I just wanted him to know his father.
Michael's father is no good.
And you wanting to bring him back
in this family is all wrong, Christina.
I know you're worried
about leaving Michael alone...
...but surely you understand
I'm all the family Michael will ever need.
- You're not his father.
- I have been his father for 12 years.
Let's not talk about this anymore.
It's going to turn out all right.
Please, trust me.
Rest now, sweetheart.
I'll come by a little later.
WOMAN
Dr. Martin, line three, please.
Dr. Martin, line three, please.
Any calls to my daughter's line,
I wanna know.
Yes, Mr. Cutler.
From the reports, they can't find them.
I want my grandson found.
I don't care how you do it, do it.
Yes, sir.
Why'd you stop?
Well, I think we all need a rest.
I don't see a hotel.
Well, Mike, I thought we'd stay
in the truck tonight.
A lot of truckers do it.
If you can do it, I can do it.
There's the spirit.
- Well, good night, Mike.
- Good night, sir.
By the way, if your neck gets sore tonight,
you can use my shoulder for a pillow.
Thanks anyway, sir,
but I think I can manage.
You sure?
Positive, sir.
Because I don't mind. It's all right.
Maybe tomorrow
we'll exercise a little bit.
Good night, sir.
Good night, Mike.
I think we can get along fine, Mike.
You're a good kid.
HAWK:
See how I do this?
You put your wrist into it, lean forward,
and you put a lot of weight in there.
But you have to use your whole body.
It's like your whole body
is one piece of machinery.
You try it.
That's it. Good grip.
That's right. Lean into it.
You can do it. Keep your wrist straight.
Good.
That's it, Mike.
Now put some muscle into it.
There's more to life than just muscles.
Meaning what?
Meaning, I don't see any books around.
You don't read much, do you?
No offense, but you're just simply
on a different social scale.
Oh, you wanna tell me more
about this social scale?
It's been said the average mental age
for an adult is 15...
...just three years older than I am.
For a trucker, it has to be
in the 11- to 13-year range.
Maybe 14, if they have good genetics.
You know, Mike, it's really great driving...
...with such a tremendous intellectual
like you.
I- It's a real blessing.
Why are you stopping?
You're aggravated, aren't you?
Boy, I passed aggravation
about a mile back.
Are you gonna get violent?
Wanna give me a break?
You know, Mike, since you think it takes
no brains at all...
...I have to be stupid and abnormal
to drive a truck, I'll tell you what.
Why don't you just come over into my seat,
and let's see if you can move...
...this machinery around. Okay?
- What?
- Drive, genius.
Okay, Mike, we got miles to go.
You know, this is an unfair test.
I've never driven a truck before.
Child's play.
I don't see what's the big deal,
just step on the clutch...
...press the gas and switch the gear.
This is no problem.
- I once drove a dune buggy.
- Really?
Mike, I'm impressed, really.
This'll be no problem at all.
You're doing great, Mike.
Why don't you turn the key.
Okay.
Now, you see that little silver button?
Push it.
Magic, huh?
Well, Mr. Dune Buggy,
you ready to drive?
Mm-hm.
Okay. Push the clutch in all the way.
Come on, son, give it a lot of leg.
- I don't have any more.
- You can do it.
Hold it in. A little bit more.
That's it. Good.
Now, give it some gas.
Now, you ready?
Okay, here we go, Captain Dune Buggy.
Blastoff, right?
Go.
Gas, Mike. A little more gas.
You got an interesting style, Mike.
Whoa.
Hold it steady, Mike.
Good, good.
Get it out there.
I'm getting a little sick, Mike.
I always wanted to be a milk shake.
Mike, we're hitting a lot ofturbulence.
Let's shift to second gear, okay?
You're doing great. Clutch all the way in.
Give it some gas.
Ready? Okay, shift.
Wow, I'm impressed.
Not bad.
I think we have a natural here.
Okay. I think you're about ready
to do it by yourself.
- No.
- Gotta go now, friend.
Go on, hold it steady.
This is great. I'm really doing it.
This is great!
Now, that wasn't so hard, was it?
What, sir?
Smiling.
You're a real natural.
Now, keep your eye on the road.
Here comes Mike.
All right.
Oh, no. You stay out of it
from now on. Right.
- Ted.
- Yes, sir.
CUTLER: We're going to have to deal
with this the old-fashioned way.
WAITRESS: Here you go.
- Thanks.
WAITRESS:
You're welcome.
That cake didn't have
much of a chance, did it?
- I was real hungry.
- Driving a truck will do that to you.
- You ready?
- Yeah, let's go.
- Can I call Mom?
HAWK: That's a good idea.
You feel good?
- Yeah, why?
- I mean, you feeling strong?
Why?
- Come with me.
- Where we going?
You'll see.
Excuse me.
- Did any of you boys ever arm-wrestle?
- Why?
I got a kid here that I think can beat any
one of you, say, two out of three times.
- He's a practical joker. Sorry.
- He's just a shy kid.
As a matter offact, I'm so sure,
I'm willing to put money on it.
Kid, if I couldn't beat you, I'd kill myself.
This is getting too intense.
- You don't have a chance against this kid.
- Yes, he does.
10-1 odds. Your one against my 10.
Fair enough?
All right, let's go, 10-1 odds.
Right here.
HAWK:
All right, two out ofthree times.
You should take that off.
That's not fair.
- He's a wimp. You'll take him easy.
HAWK: No gloves allowed.
Concentrate, Mike. You can do it.
All right, let's start. Ready, wimp?
Skin feels like a girl's.
- Maybe he is a girl.
- Probably.
Don't listen to them. You hear?
- Kill him.
- You're gonna show them now, right?
You're gonna show them.
You're gonna do it. Over the top. Ready?
- Start. Come on, Mike.
- Break his arm.
Get this little wuss!
Blow this fruit away.
- Yeah, man.
BOY 1: Bust this guy.
- Little baby.
BOY 2: Little baby. Little baby.
- Two out of three, guys.
RICHIE: Ten out of 10, man.
Whatever, we'll take anything, man.
Mike.
What are you trying to do?
All you wanted to do was embarrass me.
Well, you did it, okay?
Grandfather always said you were a loser.
Now you're trying to make me one...
...and I hate you for it.
Mike, I don't care what your grandfather
thinks about me, okay?
All I care about is you.
Now, you lost back there
because you beat yourself.
You let yourself get beat.
I know you can do it.
You're a special kid.
You're my boy, do you understand?
But you're also a spoiled, rich brat
who's always had everything done for him.
Now it's time to do for yourself,
and you can do it.
I'm telling you,
the world meets nobody halfway.
Do you understand what that means?
If you want it, Mike, you gotta take it.
Do you hear me? You gotta take it.
Go in there and try. I know you can win.
But even if you don't, so what?
So you lose.
As long as you lose like a winner, it doesn't
matter, because you did it with dignity.
If you don't go in there,
you're gonna be sorry.
You're gonna regret it your whole life.
You know what I mean?
Come on, I know you can do it.
Will you do it for me?
Come on, let's get him.
You can beat him.
You're twice as strong as he is.
You just gotta believe it,
you understand? All right?
I thought you said he was strong.
Well, my boy was just feeling generous.
Now it's time to go to work, huh, Mike?
It's time to go to work, kid.
Yeah.
- Does this kid think he can take me?
- I don't think so.
What a joke.
BOY 2: Through the table this time.
Smash him, Richie.
This is gonna hurt, wimp.
What do you think of that?
I think your breath stinks.
Go! Come on, Mike. Come on.
That's good. That's good, Mike.
Come on, Mike.
Come on. Hold him, drop the weight,
over the top, Mike.
Come on. Get tough, Mike.
Pump it, kid, pump it.
You got him, Mike! You got him,
you got him, a little bit more!
You got him, you got him,
you got him, go, Mike!
All right, Mike!
- All right, way to go.
BOY 1: Come on, man.
- One more time.
- Do it again!
- Come on, one more time.
- Let's go, Mike. Right away.
- I'm gonna break your arm, punk!
- Get mad.
Ready, go.
Come on, Mike. Come on.
You can beat him, Mike.
Harder, Mike. Over the top.
Pump it, pump it.
The power, Mike. The power, Mike.
All right, way to go.
You're a tough little sucker.
That was great. That was great.
Pay up now.
Money, please.
Come on.
How did he do that?
Good genetics.
- Thanks. Let's go.
- Let's talk to Mom.
- That was luck, man!
- Come on.
Oh, yeah, right.
I drove Dad's truck.
I'm a really good driver.
A great driver.
I had this arm-wrestling match
with some guy who was bigger.
- Maybe 5'6".
- Bigger.
- No, 5'9".
- Bigger.
Mom, you wouldn't believe it.
This guy was a monster.
Oh, that's good, darling.
I'm so proud of you.
Is your father there?
Let me speak to him, okay?
I love you, sweetheart.
I love you too.
She sounds so weak.
She'll be all right.
- I'm gonna be outside.
- Okay, champ.
Hi, honey.
It was a great idea, he and I
spending time like this together.
I hope so.
I know it won't be easy.
Oh, no. It's gonna be great,
I know it is.
So how you feeling?
Linc, whatever happens,
I want you to stay with him.
I know how difficult it is for you,
but it's really important.
He needs you, honey.
I will.
Please try to make things work
between you and my father.
He's too set in his ways to change...
...so maybe you could try
and understand him, honey.
Yeah, I'll try.
Okay. I can't wait to see you both.
Christina, he's a great kid.
And I'll see you soon, okay?
Okay.
MIKE: Dad!
- Okay, bye.
Mike!
- Mike! Mike!
MIKE: Dad!
MAN:
Come on!
MIKE:
Dad! Dad!
- Why are you doing this?
MAN: Shut up!
- Come on, Dad!
MAN: Quiet, kid!
MAN:
He's still coming.
- Oh, shit, here he comes.
- Dad!
MAN:
Come on, let's get the hell out of here!
Hurry!
He's staying with me! You tell him that!
You tell him!
- Are you okay? You all right?
- Yeah. You okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.
- Yeah, you'll live.
Thanks. Come on.
- You sure you're okay?
- Yeah.
Who were those guys, anyway?
You better ask your grandfather.
- Look at my truck.
- Oh, man.
This is gonna hurt the resale.
- I got here as soon as I could, Jason.
- Yes.
I'm afraid we don't have
much of a custody case.
- How the hell is that?
- I had my best researchers run down...
...every applicable court case
for the last 100 years.
Bottom line, Jason:
No judge is going to award you
custody of Michael.
The court will give him to his father
unless Hawks can't support him.
CUTLER: How can he support him?
The son of a bitch has lost everything.
He can't even support himself!
There's always a way to bend the law.
Isn't that yourjob?
Why don't you find the loophole?
I want my boy.
- Come on, over the top.
- Over the top.
Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Mercy. Mercy. Mercy.
Oh, you're getting too good.
You're gonna be a great one, kid.
- Almost as good as you, right?
- Well, I think you'll be better than me.
- You think you're gonna do good in Vegas?
- I'm betting on it.
I'd like to get enough money...
...and maybe buy a small company and hire
some smart guy like you to be president.
- That's not such a bad idea.
- That's a great idea.
But what if you lose?
Hey, Mike, you're not supposed
to say that.
Can I ask a question
without you getting mad?
Sure.
Why'd you leave us?
Well...
...I had some reasons.
That's not an answer.
All I can say, Mike,
is I made a mistake, I know that.
Sometimes it happens in life,
we all make mistakes.
But it won't happen again.
Yeah, you're gonna be a great one.
- You think so?
- Yes.
I'm glad I'm not going against you,
tough guy.
But before, in the ICU ward...
...well, we had a little problem.
- You okay?
- Yeah. How do I look?
You look great.
You're not nervous, are you?
Come on, let's go and see her.
Excuse me, could you tell me what room
Ms. Christina Hawk is in, please?
What is she admitted for?
Heart surgery. She'd probably be
in a private room.
Can I ask who you are?
I'm her husband.
Possibly, you'd rather talk to one
of the doctors on the case.
- Why? What's wrong?
- Excuse me.
Mr. Hawk.
I'm sorry. Your wife died this afternoon
in the operating room.
No.
Mike.
Mike!
Mike.
If you never picked me up,
I would have seen her.
I wouldn't be riding around
in that truck while she was dying.
Nobody knew, Mike.
You've never been around
when anybody needed you.
Taxi!
Taxi! Taxi! Take me to...
Mike.
Mike!
MINISTER: We are gathered here to commit
the body of Christina Marie Cutler-Hawk...
...to the ground from which it came.
We commend her soul to the Lord...
...that in his mercy...
MAN:
That must be the husband.
MINISTER:
That in his mercy...
...she may attain everlasting life.
And now let us pray with the Psalms.
The Lord is my shepherd...
...I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.
He leadeth me beside the still waters.
He restoreth my soul.
He leadeth me in the paths of
righteousness for his name's sake.
Surely goodness and mercy shall
follow me all the days of my life.
And will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.
GUARD:
Yes?
I'd like to talk to Jason Cutler, please.
You're not wanted here.
Tell him that Lincoln Hawks
would like to talk to him.
Like I said, you're not wanted here.
I wanna see my boy.
Move it out.
Move. Get this thing the hell out of here
before I call the police.
That guy, he's a loser.
He's gonna crash the wall!
Stop. What are you doing?
Get back here! What's going on?
Call the cops! I'm going out back.
Mike?
- Mike!
- Hawks!
What the hell have you done?
Mike.
Come with me, please.
Mike, please.
Do you actually think that you can
get away with what you've done?
You think you can come in here, destroy
my home and take Michael with you?
Michael Cutler is my boy!
You deserted him years ago.
And that's a fact that you can't change,
no matter what you do.
- Damn you!
- Damn you.
GUARD: Get him!
MIKE: Dad!
Dad!
Come on, let him go! Move back!
GUARD: Let him up.
CUTLER: Go to your room.
MIKE:
Please! Dad!
- Go to your room.
- Come on, Grandpa!
Go to your room, now! Go!
Mike. Mike.
We got him, let him go.
Keep his arms behind him.
OFFICER 1:
You have the right to remain silent.
If you do not choose to remain silent...
OFFICER 2:
All the way out. Slowly.
Move your arm.
You Hawks? Let's go.
Wait here.
Straight ahead.
Somebody here to see you, Hawks.
Yeah, right over there.
Sit down.
I'll make this brief, Hawk.
I'm Tim Salanger,
Mr. Cutler's personal secretary.
As you can see, you've got
a serious problem on your hands.
More than ever now, you'll need money
for attorneys, additional expenses.
What we want is for you
to leave the state.
Don't come back, we won't prosecute.
If you decide to contest the whole matter
of legal custody, you won't have a prayer.
We retain the finest law firms.
That's it.
What do you say?
What's Mike say?
Ask him yourself.
Michael.
At ease, Mike.
You're not gonna tell me to leave too,
are you?
No.
That's good. I was beginning
to think I wasn't popular.
I don't know what to think.
Mike, I know you don't trust me.
I don't blame you.
I haven't earned that yet.
I just feel like I have a home here.
You know, I-
I mean, if I went with you,
where would we go?
Where would we end up?
Together is all I can guarantee.
You say this now, and then you leave.
Mike, I'm...
I'm just a father who messed up
pretty bad, I know that.
I've done things real wrong.
Now I wanna try to fix everything up,
as best I can.
And I wanna...
...give you what's inside of me.
I- I may not have much...
...and I may never have a lot...
...but I've got something inside
that I want to give...
...to the only person...
...that means something to me.
You.
I can't.
I can't go with you.
You can't.
I'm sorry.
I understand.
Mike.
I want you to remember something.
The world meets nobody halfway,
remember that.
You gotta do what's best for you.
Always do that.
Ahem. Should I draw up the papers?
Yeah.
MAN: I appreciate your feelings
about your truck.
Best offer I can make.
Cash, though.
Seven thousand.
Take it or leave it.
You're not giving me much of a choice.
- Okay, you got a deal.
- Good.
I'd like to keep the hawk, though. Okay?
Take it.

If I win, it's just because I wanted

ANNOUNCER: Mad Dog Madison!

Harry Bosco, right here. Harry Bosco!
My whole body is an engine.
This is a fireplug.
And I'm gonna light him up.
ANNOUNCER:

Carl Adams, ladies and gentlemen!
And the newcomer from
the truckers' division, Lincoln Hawk!
Lincoln Hawk, over here.
To tell you the truth, the truck

Come on, let's go! You can take that guy!
Come in, Hawk.
You want a drink?
You don't have to stay sharp.
I understand you already lost
your first match.
What do you want, Cutler?
We don't have to be enemies.
I never wanted to be your enemy.
All right, then, let's get right to it.
With Christina gone...
...I have no family left in my life,
except for Michael.
You never had anything,
so you have nothing to lose.
Hawk, you can believe what you want to,
but you're a deserter, plain and simple.
You deserted your wife and your son.
You were tearing us apart.
Don't try to clear your conscience
at my expense.
You're a liar. You deserted them.
Are you finished?
I'm not through with you yet.
Come on outside,
I wanna show you something.
Come on.
Down there in the parking lot,
in front of the hotel.
That's the finest rig that money can buy.
If you want it, it's yours.
Here's a check for $500,000.
Take it and get the hell out of my life.
What are you trying to do?
I gave you custody of the boy.
- I signed. What more do you want?
- I'm trying to make things easy.
You don't need Michael as a meal ticket.
You're on a free ride.
So take the truck, take the money,
start a new life, start your own family.
I got a family.
When this is over,
I'm coming to get him.
You're going back on your word.
- Yeah.
- You signed over custody.
And Michael will never go with you because
you're a loser. You've always been a loser!

- Hi, Dad. I had to see you.
How did you get here?
Dad, it's a long story, but...
Listen, I wanna stay with you.
- Mike, do you?
- Yeah.
I want you to stay too...
...but I don't think your grandfather
is gonna let that happen.
But I wanna be with you, Dad.
I wanna be with you too, but, Mike,
I don't have any money. I sold the truck.
That's okay, you're gonna win
like you said, Dad, remember?
You'll win that big old truck,
and you can start your own business.
Mike, in this last match...
...I think I pulled a little too hard.
And this guy I'm going against, Bull Hurley,
he hasn't lost in about five years.
And I don't know, he's good, Mike.
He's real good.
I just don't know.
Are you saying you're gonna lose?
I might.
I don't believe this.
All that talk about never giving up
was all lies. You never believed it yourself.
And what you said to me, remember?
Now is the time to do for yourself.
The world meets nobody halfway.
If you want it, you gotta take it.
You weren't talking about me. You were
talking about yourself, weren't you?
- Mike, please.
- Now is your chance, Dad, don't you see?
I don't care about what happened before,
so stop trying to prove yourselfto me.
It doesn't matter
if you win or lose, Dad.
I- I don't care about that.
All I care about is being with you, Dad.
I love you.

He's got no shitting business there.
ANNOUNCER: Our two finalists are psyching
each other up. Can you imagine?

You been ducking me for years.
You got no chance, you know that?

- Get in here!
- Come on! You got no power, Hawks.
REFEREE 1: Square up the shoulder.
- You got no power.
REFEREE 1: Elbow down.
Back off, or I'm gonna give you
a world of hurt, little man.
And all I want to do is hurt him,
cripple him, get him off the table...
...and so he never dares try
to compete against me again.
REFEREE 1:
Ready, go!
Get him, Dad!
Down! Down!
Pray to God right now!
Pull it! Pull it, Dad! Over the top!
BULL:

Your nose hurt, Hawks?
Dad, come on, take him.
