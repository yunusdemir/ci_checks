Angus, did you get it?
Get out of here!
Did you get it?
- Where is it? Where did it go?
- I missed it.
- Why?
- How did it get away?
No, it didn't go down there.
Didn't go down there, either.
I'll get him next time.
Yeah, next time.
- Killer chase, though.
- The best.
- We'll never see that rabbit again.
It was a hare, not a rabbit.
Never see that hare again.
Hey, guys!
Hi, Sara.
Hi, Angus.
Come on, guys.
Where you going?
- To work on the boat.
It's in the barn.
I haven't seen it yet.
- Angus won't let anybody see it.
Yeah, I will.
Great boat! When will you finish it?
I still gotta put the hardware on it
and set the seats and stuff.
Then paint it.
Angus!
- Then take it out?
- Yeah, maybe next week. If we finish.
- I still gotta get more money.
- I can give you some money.
I think I'll be okay.
- You could go to South America in this.
- We're taking it to Winter Harbor.
- By yourself?
- No, with my dad, next week.
- For how long?
Five days.
Dad delivers supplies there.
Gonna miss some school.
That's great.
What will we deliver?
Propane, machine parts.
Business is picking up.
Okay, clutch, shift.
I got it.
Stay on the road. You're doing fine.
- Just ease it into second.
I'm not missing much school.
- I got it.
- Angus, clutch.
I shouldn't have hit the gas
and clutch at the same time.
- That's right.
- Got it. We're okay.
If you can get
all your work done before...
Angus!
Uh-oh.
Damn.
I just stacked it yesterday.
Too bad it was stacked so neat.
Good dog.
Looks a little thin.
Coat's kind of rough.
It's got to belong to someone.
- He don't have a collar or nothing.
- He doesn't have a collar or anything.
- He hasn't got a home.
- He could be lost.
- Dogs don't get lost.
- We'll call the animal shelter.
- They'll put him to sleep.
- We'll ask if a dog's missing.
He probably belongs to some
summer people.
Can we have this dog?
- We'll put out an ad and phone around.
- Yes!
We'll see what happens.
- But it stays outside.
- He will.
They take so long.
Get the ball!
Don't let him get it!
Not the sheets!
He's gonna get away!
This is gonna be a problem!
Grab him!
- Open his mouth!
Let go of the sheet.
Don't let him rip it!
Ripped it.
Angus said to stay here.
Paper!
Collecting...
Angus!
Stop, dog!
What are you doing?
- You told me not to let go.
Good dog.
Come on. Come on.
Here, chicken, chicken, chicken.
Yellow, come here!
Here, chicken, chicken, chicken.
A pile of feathers here.
No, Yellow!
Yellow, don't!
- Yellow, don't
Yellow!
Get him!
Why did you leave the gate open?
I don't care how he got out.
You were to make sure nothing
could get in or out of the gate.
It wasn't the dog.
- I'm not saying it was. It's not the point.
We can't have a dog.
I'll take care of him.
It's more than that. Come on.
You've got to clean up after it...
...buy food for it.
If we go someplace,
who will take care of it?
- We are someplace. We aren't in the city.
- You're already out two chickens...
...a headlight and paint for the boat.
How much is that, 130 bucks?
You know how much a dog
will cost you?
Huh?
We'll keep the dog and I'll return
the paint. If it's okay?
All right.
But this is your dog.
He's your responsibility.
- Is that clear?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Here's his collar and license,
Angus. And the name tag.
- It's a good name.
- Thanks.
- This dog food has a whistle in it, right?
- Yeah, that's it. I got that stuff.
Collar...
...license and tag.
Come on. You gotta eat
on the porch, dog.
Is all that search
and rescue hardware ready to go?
Yeah, it always is.
Hope it's more reliable
than this machine.
So when you making another supply run?
We'll be up the coast next
week. We want you looking after us.
We will. We spend a lot of time
on civilian rescues.
- What is this, Angus? Cedar or fir?
Cedar.
- Cedar?
- Yeah.
Put a little place here to stash stuff
for camping.
That's terrific.
You build a chimney so
the air feeds the fire underneath.
The rocks are like a windbreak?
Right.
Don't build them too high
or they'll fall and put out your fire.
- Got enough to eat?
- We got a whole box, Dad.
- If you run out, there's always bugs.
- Bugs?
Yeah, moths and dragonflies...
...bees...
...snails, worms, stuff like that.
It's all good.
- That would taste like crap.
- Ants taste like crap...
...because there's too much acid
in them, but it's all protein.
- And you can mix them with berries.
Yeah.
Crush them so they don't move around.
It's easier to swallow.
They won't squirm back up on you.
- Okay, I'll see you in the morning.
Yeah.
- You're in charge of the fire.
- Yeah.
See you, Mr. McCormick.
I'm gonna bring the food in.
Okay.
- Here.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
Figures you'd be a mooch.
I bet you don't know how to sit.
Lie down.
Heel.
Okay, you've got me convinced.
I know I'm gonna regret this.
Good dog.
Okay, here's
your fishing line and hooks.
I got the cook pot and the tarp
and the other stuff.
- That's your camping kit.
- Yep.
Oh, and...
...this goes to the next boat's master.
- This was your father's.
- Yes, it was.
How old is this?
60, 65 years old.
Still perfect.
It's perfect.
This is a really good boat, Angus.
I bet we could go all the way to China.
<i>Where is Winter Harbor, Angus?</i>
200 miles down the coast.
Along here?
The direction's right, but it's down there.
- How come I can't go with you?
- You gotta stay and do the papers...
...and help Mom with the chickens.
- I'm still not old enough.
Here. Want this?
- It's yours. You can have it.
- I can?
It's yours.
- Thanks, Angus.
- Tofino, Yuquot, Winter Harbor.
- Yeah. Be three days up, two back.
I'll call you at 7:00 every morning.
- Sounds good.
Hey, Angus.
- It's the girl, back again.
- Thought I'd missed you.
Sorry.
It's okay. I got here.
I made you these.
- Thank you.
- They're a little burned, but not much.
The stove got out of control
for a few minutes.
Yeah, they are...
- Thanks anyway.
- There's lots of sugar in them.
If you're cold, they'll heat you up.
I... I gotta go.
See you when you get back.
- See you guys in a week.
Okay.
Bye, Sara.
Take care.
- See you later.
- Bye.
- Bye, Mom.
Have fun.
I will.
- Bye.
Bye.
All right, bye.
Bye.
Bye, Yellow Dog.
Bye, Dad! Bye, Angus!
Bye, guys!
Bye!
It's cold, gray and wet.
<i>It's great here. </i>
<i>It will clear by tonight. </i>
Mmm.
- How are the guys?
<i>- They're doing fine</i>
Good.
- We miss you already.
- I miss you too.
Silas up?
- He's still in bed.
- Tell him I'll call tomorrow.
I will. Bye, honey.
<i>- Bye, Katherine. </i>
Bye, honey.
So we passed Yuquot.
Sunday, Kyuquot.
We should make Katalla Island in 3 hours
We'll wait out the weather there.
- Dad.
Thanks. Oh.
- Dad.
- Hmm.
It's Yuquot Lighthouse.
Just off Nootka Island.
So we're like an hour away from Katalla?
A little more.
We should probably head in sooner.
Cormorant <i>calling Tofino</i>
<i>Coast Guard Radio. </i>
<i>Tofino Coast Guard Radio. </i>
We're right off Nootka Island about
two hours south of Yuquot Lighthouse.
We need a weather advisory
for the next few hours and overnight.
Tofino Coast Guard Radio.
Tofino Coast Guard Radio.
Never trust the ocean, Angus.
These swells are real big, Dad.
We should put in to land
and find a safe harbor.
Whoa!
I got you. Grab the wheel.
I got it.
Got it?
Dad, I gotta check my boat.
Wait until we get to shelter.
Pull it to starboard here.
I gotta check my boat.
Don't go without your life jacket.
- Got the wheel?
- Yeah.
Angus!
<i>Emergency beacon 4 miles</i>
<i>southwest of Yuquot Lighthouse. </i>
<i>Dispatching search plane. </i>
<i>Rescue 456, take off runway 29.</i>
<i>Rescue 310, number two</i>
<i>for departure. </i>
<i>Overturned hull in sight</i>
<i>and there appears to be movement. </i>
<i>We are returning to hospital, 17-45.</i>
Hello?
Did they find him?
Not yet.
He had a life jacket.
- They're gonna find him.
Don't worry, honey, they'll find him.
We'll find him, Dad.
They'll find us soon.
They're gonna be looking for us.
Hope Dad's okay.
Matches.
Some good.
Fishing lines and hooks.
And Sara's cookies.
We might get really hungry.
I know.
We are really hungry.
Do you mind?
Come on.
Come on, Yellow!
Good boy.
Look, John, he's with the boat.
He'll stay with the boat.
- If it didn't sink, we'll find it.
- It's a really good boat. Angus built it.
Are you saying it's possible
we might not see him?
I didn't say that.
We don't ever stop a search...
...if there's any hope.
You know that.
I think we should go back to the hotel.
Hey, Mom, wait up!
"As he looked over the water,
shimmering with rays of light...
...he waited for the orcas to return.
The day the orcas came that summer,
the old man died. "
Mom?
Yeah?
When you die...
...would you go under the ocean?
Or maybe...
...up into space?
- I think you'd go to heaven, probably.
- Then open your eyes and wake up?
No, you don't open your eyes again.
It's like sleep, but...
...well, different.
It's forever?
Yes, it is.
At least you can visit people
whenever you want.
"When the girl wept for her grandfather,
her mother dried her tears.
'Don't be sad, sweet girl.
Your grandfather's spirit has gone
to leap and swim with the whales. '"
Five days.
We need more wood for a signal fire.
<i>Fourteen. </i>
<i>Fifteen. </i>
<i>I know we should stay in one place,</i>
<i>but they haven't seen us for nine days. </i>
<i>They might think we're in the boat. </i>
<i>I haven't caught a fish in days. </i>
<i>If we stay here, we'll starve. </i>
<i>The lighthouse is 15 or 20 miles away. </i>
<i>We can get there, easy. </i>
<i>Dad says to always have a plan. </i>
Come on, Yellow.
Come on, Yellow.
If we can't get to the lighthouse
this way, we'll find a way.
Wait!
Wait!
I'm sorry, we've only got
enough fuel to get to base.
We'll find him.
It's okay, Yellow.
We'll be okay. We're gonna make it.
Yellow!
Yellow!
Yellow!
Yellow!
Good boy. Good dog.
Shh!
We got him.
Wait a second. Just leave it.
I got him.
It was found some distance
from the wreck and it may not be his.
It's his. He's on shore.
We've recrossed the shore many times.
- He's right. He's on shore.
- Don't worry, we're not stopping.
Are we going the right way?
Are we going back the way we came?
I don't know.
Maybe you should lead.
You've got six senses, right?
Go home.
You gotta keep...
...your legs...
...and your feet protected.
Your legs will be okay.
You've got fur.
<i>Rescue 4 to base, we've spotted</i>
<i>some debris. Could be a campsite. </i>
<i>Going in for a closer look. </i>
Good boy!
He's going to be okay.
We'll find him.
Grilled chicken sandwich...
...with mayonnaise
and lettuce and tomato.
And a vanilla milkshake.
Two vanilla milkshakes.
Some mashed potatoes and...
No, French fries.
Macaroni and cheese.
I haven't had macaroni in a while.
Fifteen days is a long time.
Four since we started on land.
The weather hasn't been great.
He's real good in the bush.
- McCormick's taught him a lot.
- We don't know that he went inland.
- How long will you keep looking?
- While there's a reasonable expectation.
Then you'll keep looking for a long time.
- He didn't mean...
- They are not going to stop looking!
I didn't say that, Katherine.
I'm sorry, but...
...often we can't find entire aircraft
down in the trees.
Eventually, we find them but...
Well, you know...
Come with me for a few hours.
I'll show you what I mean.
Here. It's berries and roots.
Come on, it's got protein and fat.
Come on. Here. Here. Come on.
Come on.
How far do you think
he would get inland?
- About a mile a day?
- No, more than that. Twice that.
He thinks we should go back soon.
There's nothing else that both of us
can do that one of us can't.
It's been 17 days.
John's a realist.
I don't want to go back.
You want to go that way?
Okay. We can go that way.
What do you think, Yellow?
It's a building or something.
Now how are we going to do this one?
Come on, Yellow. Come on.
Good boy, Yellow. Come on.
Keep going.
<i>Take off everything wet. </i>
<i>Get dry and warm. </i>
<i>Stop hypothermia before it starts</i>
<i>to lower your body temperature. </i>
Yellow! Yellow!
Get back here! Yellow!
Yellow, leave it!
Come on.
Arm.
Silas, come on, help me out.
Get the rest of your stuff ready.
Honey?
Listen to me.
Listen to me.
Now, look...
...you're not doing him any good
falling apart. Are you?
No.
Okay?
Okay.
In this building there might be
some food.
Nothing.
No food.
Nothing.
<i>A logging road. </i>
<i>It's gotta lead somewhere. </i>
<i>We gotta get to it. </i>
Yellow?
Come on.
Come on, come on.
It's okay.
Come on.
It's okay.
We'll make it across.
Come back!
Search Master.
They found him.
<i>Rescue 310 airborne. </i>
About a mile east of the tower.
Upstream.
The winds will be 50 knots.
<i>Man is out the door. </i>
Come on.
Ready in five...
...three...
...two...
...one. Steady.
Stay where you are!
Let me come to you! Don't move!
Left.
Left. Steady.
Stay still!
Grab ahold of me!
- You gotta get my dog!
- We'll come back for him, don't worry!
Yellow! Yellow!
We lost the dog.
We'll come back for him.
Yellow!
You gotta get my dog!
We'll get your dog, buddy.
Don't you worry. We'll get your dog.
Winds gusting to 70 knots.
I can't stay here.
<i>Okay, let's get out of here. </i>
<i>Rescue 310, estimating</i>
<i>hospital pass 2030 Zulu. </i>
They found him!
They found him!
They found him!
He's right in here.
Hi there.
Hey, guys.
Hi, sweetie.
- How you doing?
- Pretty good.
- Hey, Si.
- Hi.
I love you, Dad.
- Careful!
- Sorry.
I lost him, Dad. I lost Yellow.
Don't worry, they're still
looking for him.
Why can't they find him?
- They almost didn't find you.
I want you to try and get some sleep.
Things will look better tomorrow.
I don't want to go to school.
I'll tell you what:
Let's give it a try.
If it doesn't work out,
you can take a few more days off.
- Okay?
- Okay.
Okay.
Did you eat any of the cookies?
I had a couple.
They were good.
I'm gonna make you more.
Yeah, well, maybe next week
if you want to.
- Really?
- Sure.
Nobody wants to say it,
but you're a hero.
My dog's the hero.
He is too.
<i>We've looked for three weeks. </i>
<i>I'm really sorry we can't find him. </i>
It's a budget issue, you know?
The search costs $200,000 a week.
- They'll spend it on a boy...
- I understand.
- You did more than we could ask.
- I'll tell you, that was a great dog.
Dad?
He didn't know.
He was trying to protect me.
He didn't know they were saving me.
I should've pulled him up by his collar.
There's nothing you could have done.
You know that.
Don't you?
- What if a farmer gets him?
- Then he'll take care of him.
Your mother's right.
You have to have a dog.
Are you okay?
I'm okay, yeah.
I gotta go.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Look!
It's Yellow! Yellow!
He's back!
Yellow! Yellow!
