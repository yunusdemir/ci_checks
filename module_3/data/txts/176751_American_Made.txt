<i>For the first time

<i>Alpha, Alpha 15

<i>Yeah, Alpha, Alpha 15
at November for time at Delta Delta.</i>
Shit.
Howdy, folks.
I apologize for the delay.
We're at number 11 for take off.
We'll try to make it up
in the air.
Just wake me up over Texas.
Apologies from the flight deck.
Just a little bit of turbulence.
Thank you all for flying

Barry.
What's that?
Barry Seal.
That's right.
You have a...
drop off and pick up service
here every other Thursday.
Cuban exiles.
They pay commercial pilots
to smuggle homegrown contraband
through Canadian hubs.
Vancouver, Montreal.
Right?
I'm sorry, I don't know
what you're talkin' about.
- No?
- No.
You're smuggling cigars.
You have an
interesting file, Barry.
File?
Starts off with a bang.
Top of your class
in the Civil Air Patrol.
Youngest pilot in TWA history.
You were going places.
What is goin' on here?
Revolution is in the air, Barry.
Central America, right now.
We're building nations
down there, Barry.
We're building nations.
It's America at its fuckin' finest.
And we could use someone like you.
God damn.
You're CIA.
Shhh.
Holy shit.
Hot damn.
Look at her.
Well, they
they tell me she's pretty fast.
Yeah. Yeah.
The fastest
twin engine on the planet.
I mean, shit.
She looks like she's goin' 300
miles an hour just sittin' there.
CIA owns this?
No. No.
Independent Aviation Consultants.
- IAC.
- Yeah.
What is that? What do they call
one of them front groups, is it?
No, no, no.
It's as real as IBM.
You'd run the company, but
after hours, you work for us.
Yup.
It takes pictures?
We say it collects intelligence.
Where?
Russia?
South of the border.
North of the equator.
Let's just say...
Enemies of democracy.
Look, the real work is covert.
You understand?
- So, so...
- "Covert".
Anyone finds out about it...
Family, friends, even Lucy.
It's Lucy, right?
Yeah, that's right.
That'd be a problem.
- What?
- All this is legal?
If you're doin' it
for the good guys... yeah.
Just don't get caught.
You wanna take it for a spin?
Fuck it.
Take it for a fucking spin.
I want you to
take her for a spin.
It's all for me.
It's a new business.
It's gonna be my business.
- Okay, logistical support for airports.
- That's right.
Okay.
And you're callin' it IAC?
What do you know about business?
You are a TWA airline pilot.
That's how you support this family.
This is gonna be good for us.
What about benefits?
Our healthcare?
And we have great
healthcare with TWA.
You know, I'm sure that's
not gonna be a problem.
And what the hell does
IAC mean, anyway?
Independent Aviation Consultants.
Well, that sounds fuckin'
made up, Barry.
It does?
Flight control screen correct.
- Warning and annunciator lights.
- Check... on that.
- Anti-skid lights.
- Lights off.
- Landing gear.
- Handle's down, three green.
- Speed brake lever.
- Stowed.
- Thrust levers.
- Cut off.
- Engine start levers.
- Cut off.
- Snap trim panel switches.
- Normal.
Fire warning system.
Check.
Radius transponder radar.
- Barry? Radius transponder radar.
- Yeah, check, check.
- Rudder aileron trim.
- Zero zero.
Windows.
Closed.
Flight attendant briefing.
Barry?
You gonna be all right, Jimmy.
Where are you-
where are you going?
Barry!
Barry, where are you going?
Shit. I know, I know.
That was bold.
That was bold.
I do tend to leap before I look.
Maybe...
Maybe I should've asked
a few more questions.
Anyways, back in '78, in...
September?
October.
Anyway, it...
That was the day
I joined the CIA.
<i>Now, in those days,
the cold war was in full swing.</i>
<i>The Soviets were backing</i>
<i>communist insurgents
all over Central America.</i>
<i>The CIA wanted snaps
of them insurgents.</i>
<i>♪ Ain't but one way out baby ♪</i>
<i>♪ Lord I just can't
go out the door ♪</i>
Now these pictures
are sensational.
Who's responsible?
They're mine.
- Hey, Monty.
- Yeah.
Who the fuck is he?
- Hurry!
- Now!
Shit!
Come on, now.
Come on, now.
Fuck!
Woo!
<i>The people's choice.</i>
So so then I show him this one.
And he goes "Goddammit, Schafer,
I didn't ask for mug shots."
I mean, they said they're
the best reconnaissance photos
they have ever seen.
So, does this mean
I get a raise?
You're doing great.
You got a family, Schafer?
Big push!
Motherfucker!
Wife, kids?
See, I I didn't tell Lucy
I ain't workin' for TWA no more.
You're serving your country.
I am gonna need
some more money at some point.
You'll figure it out.
We we're sending you
to Panama tomorrow.
<i>The CIA was so happy
with my work,</i>
<i>they gave me another job.</i>
<i>Bag man.</i>
<i>See, there was this
Colonel down in Panama</i>
<i>named Noriega.</i>
<i>And he was selling the Agency's intel
on all the commies down there.</i>
For your friends.
<i>My job was just to
drop off and pick up.</i>
<i>Just drop off.</i>
<i>And pick up.</i>
<i>Right here in Baton Rogue.</i>
<i>You're listening to the
best in Louisiana music.</i>
- Hey, Luce, pancakes are up.
- Thanks, baby.

<i>Si. Gasolina.</i>

Thank you for coming to see me.
Sir, I-I think there's
been some sort of
mistake here, because I...
These fellas just picked me up
at the airport.
No, no.
No mistake.
Just please... have a seat.
Coffee, Mr. Seal?
<i>Dos tinticos.</i>
You know my name?
You're the gringo who flies
to Central America every week.
Taking pictures very low
with your fancy plane.
Yeah, I mean...
those photos, see I have a...
aviation company here
in South America, I advise...
- Yes, the AIC.
- IAC. Yes, Sir.
Or is it CIA?
What? No, no, no.
I'm just a businessman here.
I'm a businessman.
Imports-Exports. Cattle.
Horses.
But now...
Now, God above has blessed
this great country with new riches,
Mr. Seal.
And you could help us.
How's that?
You know the routes.
You can get in and out <i>Estados
Unidos</i> with your fancy plane.
What kind of riches
we talkin' 'bout here?
<i>♪ That familiar sunrise ♪</i>
<i>♪ Through sleepy eyes ♪</i>
<i>♪ How happy I'd be ♪</i>
Cocaine, Mr. Seal.
<i>♪ On blue bayou ♪</i>
We had a few difficulties
getting our exports
to your country, Mr. Seal.
<i>9996.</i>
Ma'am, what's in the bag?
We decided to try new ideas.
We want you
to take off from here.
Fly directly to Miami.
We'll pay you $2,000 per kilo.
How much is a kilo?
2.2 pounds, Mr. Seal.
$2,000...
every 2.2 pounds.
I'm sorry, fellas.
I didn't catch ya'll's names.
<i>Jorge Ochoa.</i>
<i>Carlos Lehder.</i>
<i>Pablo Escobar.</i>
<i>A couple of billion
dollars from now,</i>
<i>they'd be known as
the Medellin Cartel.</i>
<i>See, back then, they're just
three businessmen</i>
<i>tryin' to figure out
how to get their</i>
<i>merchandise to the United States.</i>
<i>There was just
one small problem.</i>
<i>See, pilots, they were</i>
<i>killin' themselves tryin'
to get off that runway.</i>
I see you had a few other boys
try to make it outta here.
<i>Si. Si</i>, terrible pilots.
Yeah, well...
I'm sure they were heavy.
You know, carryin' a lot of fuel
to make to States...
And merchandise and...
Yeah, you know, this airport,
I mean it's...
High altitude
and a short runway.
I mean, shit, you got trees
and mountains on both sides.
Is there
Is there somewhere else
I could take off from?
Not where the army wouldn't notice.
Well...
Can you make the runway longer?
They say
I should get rid of you.
That you can't do it.
- We have our people in Miami.
- Yeah.
You gonna land at the Okeechobee
Airport between 2:00 and 6:00 a.m.
Look, there's...
There's been a change of plans
'cause I ain't landin' in Miami...
Thank you. <i>Gracias.</i>
See, I ain't landin'
anywhere with this stuff.
That's, that's how
ya'll got in trouble.
Now, look, just,
just hear me out.
I know Louisiana.
Now, here's a map.
Now, I'm gonna drop this stuff
right where "X" marks the spot.
All right? Just...
What do you mean
you're not gonna land, <i>huevon</i>?
Okay, just...
Hey, come here, just...
Look, just look at this.
Look.
See, right here.
See that there?
Right there is your
million-dollar door.
All right?
You just go around.
Each side... tight.
No, no, no.
No more.
I said no more.
<i>No mas. No mas.
No mas. No mas.</i>
But there's plenty of room, gringo.
<i>- No, no. Si, si, Hasta arriba.</i>
- Guys, guys.
It ain't about room, all right?
It's about weight.
Now, we agreed on 200,
I even put on 300.
<i>No mas.
No mas.</i>
Keep pushin', come on.
I need all the runway I can get.
Keep goin', keep goin'.
See that.
<i>Pare. Pare. Pare.</i>
Hold. Hold.
<i>Bien, bien.</i>
<i>Gracias, gracias.</i>
Ho,
Where the hell do you
think you're going, big fella?
Come on. Out.
He's gonna guard the product.
This guy's fatter than fuck.
I'm already 1500 pounds
overweight.
Either I fly the big fella,
or I fly your product.
Good luck, <i>hermano.</i>
God will keep you safe.
He ain't gonna make this
runway any longer.
Hey, Jorge.
Come here, give me it.
Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on!
Jesus!
Woo!
I've got a possible target
headed due north.
25 miles off shore.
That's platform 14,
one of Shell's helicopters.
You need to disregard.
<i>Coronamos de mi puta!</i>
<i>- Señores, salud</i>, Barry.
- Cheers, cheers.
<i>Esta loco este huevon.</i>
<i>Esta loco.</i>
Barry, <i>esto es para ti.</i>
For you.
Was that... Wednesday?
You want me to go-he wants me
to go again on Wednesday.
- Yes, next Wednesday.
- What about the...
That runway?
Pablo, Jorge!
<i>Tranquilo, tranquilo.</i>
Wait here, Barry.
Wait here.
<i>Tranquilo, tranquilo.</i>
Are we running?
What...
What is that?
You want me to wait here?
Pablo?
My God.
<i>Si, si, si, si, si...</i>
Barry?
Barry Seal?
Schafer?
- Barry Seal?
- Schafer?
My God.
You look terrible.
So good to see you.
- You missing a tooth?
- Yeah.
What the fuck?
- See these guys here?
- Yeah.
I think they know that I am CIA.
You're not CIA.
You're a drug smuggler, Barry.
Listen, Louisiana PD was
notified of your arrest here.
They're gonna raid your
house at 6:00 am.
They're gonna pick up Lucy,
bring her in for questioning.
Maybe even keep her overnight.
My God.
My God. You gotta
get me out of here.
Well, maybe...
Maybe we could figure
something out.
<i>Okay. You can-you can
stop now, if you want, 'cause...</i>
Believe me...
Shit gets crazy from here.
<i>Remember them fellas that I
told you I was takin' snaps of?</i>
<i>Turns out, they was
a bunch of commies.</i>
<i>Called themselves Sandinistas.</i>
<i>These fellas managed to get their
shit together</i>
<i>and take control right here in this
little country called Nicaragua.</i>
<i>No, that's El Salvador.
Here you go, Nicaragua.</i>
<i>This is the first successful
revolution in Central America.</i>
<i>Now, that may have been
bad news for some people.</i>
<i>But not for me. See,
there's a new sheriff in town.</i>
<i>My fellow Americans,
I must speak to you tonight</i>
<i>about a mounting danger
in Central America.</i>
<i>Even after everything that happened,
I-I still love Ronnie Reagan.</i>
<i>I mean, any man that can make it
from that monkey movie</i>
<i>- all the way to the White House...
- What's the matter with him?</i>
<i>He's gotta know
what the hell he's doing.</i>
<i>What he wanted</i>
<i>was to kick them commie
Sandinistas out of Nicaragua.</i>
<i>And he wanted the Nicaraguan
freedom fighters</i>
<i>called Contras to do it.</i>
<i>They need to know that the U.S.
supports them</i>
<i>with more than just
pretty words and good wishes.</i>
<i>But Congress, well they smelled
the makings of another Vietnam.</i>
<i>And they outright refused
to let Ronnie have his war.</i>
<i>But do you think them politicians
could tell the Gipper what to do?</i>
<i>Hell, no.
He turned to the CIA.</i>
<i>And the CIA turned to me.</i>
Schafer, Schafer, that
morning raid on my family...
So, that's off now, right?
No, no. That's
that's still happening.
- What?
- 6:00 am.
This fucking country!
- Now, hold on.
- Stop!
Now, we have a deal.
I'm not a cop, Barry.
I can't make a search warrant
go away, you know?
Things are in motion here.
Come on, man.
What that hell am I gonna do?
I suggest you get your
family out of Louisiana.
- Where am I supposed to take 'em?
- We got a place for you.
Mena.
Arkansas.
Arkansas?
Hey.
Hey, Luce.
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.
My God, baby,
what happened to you?
I'm okay.
Barry, you're missing a tooth.
Hey...
We're movin'.
We gotta pack everything up.
We gotta be outta here
before the sun comes up.
We so we get these
dresses and...
You do you need all them shoes?
Hey, there, sunshine.
How you doin'? Now look,
I'm gonna give you a plastic bag.
I want you to go upstairs
and put your favorite toys...
Go on back to bed, honey.
Daddy done lost his mind.
No, darlin', you listen to Daddy.
You go do that.
- See, we're going on an adventure.
- No, we're not going on an adventure.
Like the time we went
camping in the park?
Not actually, but-'cause every
adventure's different.
My God, you're actually
serious right now.
Barry, it's 4:00 a.m.,
I'm not moving.
- Christina's school play is tomorrow!
- Do you trust me?
No!
But you love me.
You do love me.
Of course, I fucking love you.
Then listen, we gotta move.
We gotta get outta here
before the sun comes up.

The Israelis captured these,

And you're gonna

You didn't say
nothin' 'bout guns.
It's a war, Barry.
Freedom fighters can't put up much
of a fight if they aren't armed.
This was the deal.
Or would you rather be
in a Colombian prison?
This is every current law enforcement
investigation in the Gulf Coast.
FBI, ATF, DEA, Customs.
These maps will help you
avoid all of 'em.
Holy shit.
You just fly where they ain't.
Everything in this hangar's mine.
Yeah.
That truck's mine.
- Tools are mine.
- Yes, sir.
This airplane is mine.
Bag is mine.
What bag?
I fed the kids.
They're sleepin'.
I unpacked the car.
That is good.
Fixed the sink.
Just the valve.
See, I told you,
that was gonna be easy.
Fuck, Barry!
Okay, all right, all right.
Okay.
Ima come clean.
I don't work for TWA no more.
No shit, Barry.
Are you going to prison?
No, ma'am.
You gotta take care
of this family.
'Cause I will take the kids.
I will go right back to working
for Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Luce, what I'm workin' on...
- Barry, I'm six months pregnant.
- It's top secret.
I need a fridge.
I need beds for our children.
I need a stove,
a fucking washing machine.
Washing machine over there.
Let me just...
Is this all legal?
All right, what I'm about to
tell you... Now, you-you...
You gotta swear you can't
ever tell anybody this, Lucy.
All right?
I am working...
for the CIA.
<i>Hola!</i>
Howdy, <i>amigos</i>.
I'm here on behalf of Uncle Sam.
Look, Schafer.
I ain't no military expert,
but are you sure
these are the right guys?
'Cause they seem a damn sight
more interested in my boots
than in your guns.
<i>Look, this is getting big time.</i>
<i>Schafer, I just don't think
I'm the guy for this.</i>
You just keep delivering
that pizza, you hear me?
<i>You just keep delivering.</i>
<i>Hola.</i> All right.
These are gifts.
All right?
All right? Gifts.
<i>Regalos de mi.</i>
Back off. Off.
<i>Regalos.</i>
<i>Amigos.</i>
<i>Atras, atras.</i>
Now, these guns
are gifts from Uncle Sam.
I'm not fuckin' around.
Barry! Put the bat down, <i>huevon!</i>
We're all friends here.
Jorge.
What the hell are you doing here?
This is Don Adolfo Calero.
He works for your
government on the revolution
to bring down the Sandinistas.
Jorge tells me you are
the crazy gringo
who always delivers.
We have a new business
proposition to you, Barry.
You bring your American
guns to Colombia,
deliver our cocaine here
to the Contras,
the Contras take it by
fishing boats to Miami,
and everybody's happy.
It's for the war effort, Mr. Seal.
<i>Turns out the Contras didn't really
want to fight a war.</i>
<i>They just want to make money.
Like the rest of us.</i>
<i>Meanwhile, the Medellin Cartel
wanted guns.</i>
<i>So they worked out
a little trade.</i>
<i>What was I gonna tell 'em?</i>
I'm just a gringo
who always delivers.
<i>Here's how the operation worked.</i>
<i>I'd load up the guns at Mena.</i>
<i>Then, using Schafer's intel,
I'd bypass any law enforcement</i>
<i>and fly straight to the
Cartel's airstrip in Medellin.</i>
<i>Colombians, well,
they love them guns.</i>
<i>Then I'd load up with fresh powder</i>
<i>and fly on to the
Contra training camp.</i>
<i>The Contras hid the coke in fishing
boats and sailed it up to Miami.</i>
<i>Meanwhile, I'd get
another load of powder,</i>
<i>take it back to the States
with a quick stop to refuel in Panama,</i>
<i>under the protection of
my old friend, Colonel Noriega.</i>
Congratulations on your
promotion, General.
<i>Of course, he'd get his cut too.</i>
<i>On the way back,
I'd keep an eye out for the DEA.</i>
<i>Then I'd dump it all
in the swamps in Louisiana.</i>
<i>The operation got so big,
I had to get some help.</i>
<i>Pete Dubois, manufactured guns
until he discovered</i>
<i>he had a knack for selling pot.</i>
<i>Stan Mason flew dope from
Mexico to Arizona.</i>
<i>Bill Cooper,</i>
<i>he flew opium all around
Southeast Asia during Vietnam.</i>
<i>Then there's Bob.</i>
<i>I don't know much about Bob.
Hell of a pilot, though.</i>
<i>I call these boys my Snowbirds.</i>
<i>And we could fly through anything.</i>
Schafer.
Barry.
How's it going?
Hey Boss!
That was fucking crazy, man!
How's it
how's it going down there?
You know...
Busy.
You?
Yeah.
Busy.
Where are they going?
We need to borrow some
of your land.
They want you to
fly 'em up here to-to train.
For training.
Who?
The Contras.
You want me to
bring 'em up here?
To me?
We're setting up a field
and operational training ground.
Where? On...
- My land?
- Yeah.
Starting immediately.
Which is great.
Is that a problem?
Hey.
Whatever you need, boss.
<i>Que?</i>
<i>Necesito un baño.</i>
<i>No baño.</i>
Hang on! We're supposed to have 15.
I'm only counting 12 here.
Them Contras were damn excited
about being in the US of A.
They were runnin' away almost
faster than we could bring 'em in.
Hey, you two! Where do you
think you're going?
What, you want to quadruple
the shipments?
We're counting on the Contras
to win by summer if we...
if we give 'em what they need.
That's great.
How much more can you get
out of your guy in Mena?
We'll get everything out of him.
That's what I like to hear.
We're expanding operations, Barry.
Come on. One at a time.
One at a time! Hey, hold on.
No, no, no.
We'll take care of everybody,
just <i>calma.</i>
Back!
Back!
<i>Calma, calma.</i>
Everyone just calm the fuck down!
<i>Salud.</i>
- Hey, Barry.
- Yeah.
Do you think those
Contras can win?
No.
Hi.
This just came.
"Go Razorbacks, Barry."
Season tickets.
50-yard line.
Well, that was awful nice of him.
How much property has Seal
bought us since he came to town?
I don't know, 500 acres?
2,000 acres.
From the airport to Ouachita.
What's he want with all that
worthless land?
It's really none of our business.
Really.
He's good people, Judy.
And he's doing a lot
for the community.
I'd like to open a bank account.
Bless you!
I'll be right back.
David!
Come on, Christina!
Good job, guys.
Woo!
- Great, Christina!
- Go, go, go, go!
Oranges. You guys
want some oranges?
Hey guys, I got pizza!
You guys want some pizza?
Yeah! All right.
Let me just put this right...
There you go.
- Nice wheels!
- You like her?
I do.
1982.
All the bells and whistles.
First one in the State of Arkansas,
and she's yours.
She's mine?
She's yours.
My God, Barry!
Thank you!
A little somethin' extra in there.
Fuck me, Barry!
What?
Okay, you need to behave.
I brought some snacks up
for you, Christina.
<i>By the summer of '82,</i>
<i>business was booming.</i>
Got us at Tuesday at 3:00.
Tuesday at 3:00.
<i>We need to increase
the shipments.</i>
Can you add a Friday delivery?
Friday? Okay. Hold on, now.
Yeah?
We want to double the
amount of guns we're bringing in.
- Double?
<i>- Next pass by Friday.</i>
Hold on, does that-
does that have to be Friday?
<i>I opened a few
front corporations.</i>
I can't wait to learn
everything there is to know
about the sign business, Mr. Seal.
Me too.
I spent 30 years workin' the pumps
at Gas 'n Sip.
Well, Sir, I think it's about time
you moved to upper management.
<i>But the money was comin' in
faster than I could launder it.</i>
<i>I was takin' pictures.</i>

Your husband is a genius.

My wife, Lucy.
No, no, no.
<i>I had my fingers in every pie

What the fuck!
Look at you!
- Look at you!
- God damn!
Get in here.
Look at this fuckin' house.
Parkin' Chevys a lot harder
than it fuckin' looks, dude.
Hey, watch your mouth
around the kids.
Sorry.
Is that right?
Yeah, man.
They had me...
crammin' those S-10s into every
goddamn inch of the parkin' lot.
Hey, you heard me.
I'm sorry!
But the thing is,
is that, the cars were
so close to each other, right?
You couldn't help
but scratch, right?
And then, they would take
the scratches out of
my fucking paycheck, man.
- Hey! JB.
- Sorry.
Well, I don't know how
you handled the pressure, JB.
You stayin' here,
you gettin' a job.
Or you know, I could just
give you some folded cash,
you go and do what you want.
- Don't you look at him like that.
- What?
You are gettin' a job, JB,
not a handout.
My brother's gettin' a job, Barry.
You're gettin' a job.
Definitely.
You hear that? Thats the law.
You gonna have to work, son.
- You gonna have to work.
- That's right.
Hey, what-what is it
I'll be doin' exactly?
Yo, Barry!
Barry!
Barry!
What now, JB?
Say, this is a big hangar.
And I'm tired of sweeping.
You can take a break
when you get it done.
Let's go. Get it done.
Hey man, I got a new job for ya.
Give me a beer, man.
Dead soldier.
Fuck this.
Barry?
Yeah?
Roscoe dug this up
in the backyard.
There are bills
blowin' around everywhere.
I'll rake it up in the mornin'.
I found three more of 'em

These are dangerous animals.
You know, maybe we should

No, honey, I got this.
Come on.
Hang on.
JB got a new car.
Did you give that boy a raise?
Hey, Barry, Luce.
What in the holy fuck?
That girl is 15.
- It's huge.
- I told you it's huge.
You actually live here?
Hey. Can you talk to
you for a second?
Yeah.
- What?
- Come here.
- What the hell, JB?
- What?
- I hadn't done nothin' yet.
- JB.
- JB. Come on.
- Hi, Mrs. Seal.
What-we was just
gonna go for a swim.
Come here.
- Please don't tell my mama I was here.
- Come on.
Where'd you get the
money for this car?
Ima be honest with you, Barry.
'Cause I can't lie to you.
I stole it from the hangar.
What?
I opened up
one of the Samsonites.
I found so much
fuckin' money in there.
- So much goddamn money.
- JB, JB, JB...
JB, you can't do that.
You can't do that.
500 down to 300.
Watch out for that tree at the end.
Yeah, I remember that.
No, Pete, you gotta turn that off.
I can't see nothin' with that on.
Gotcha.

<i>Yeah, I know that, amigo. Listen, could
you hold on, I'll be right back.</i>
- JB?
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>There's some people
that wanna talk to me.</i>
No, no no. You don't talk to
anyone about anything.
<i>Now, you do what that
lawyer tells you to.</i>
<i>And you keep your
fucking mouth shut.</i>
<i>- I'm taking care of this.</i>
- Okay.
Listen, Jorge, we gotta put on
the brakes for a bit.
Brakes? No, no, no.
No brakes.
<i>We have product to move.</i>
I understand <i>amigo</i>,
but I-I got a family situation.
<i>Your brother-in-law.
We know all about it.</i>
<i>- We'll handle it, amigo.</i>
- No, no, no, no.
- I don't want you to handle it.
<i>- Barry, listen.</i>
- I got it. I got this.
- Barry, listen to me.
We'll handle it, okay?
So don't worry.
<i>- We'll talk business later.</i>
- Jorge...
Barry, they don-they don't know
about them suitcases you got.
Or what you got in them planes,
the guns you got.
They don't know anything about it.
We're good, man.
I can't fix this.
You hear?
They're gonna give you 10-
10 years for not talkin'.
That's 10 years people
gotta worry you will.
I didn't say anything, man.
You can talk to the goddamn lawyer.
Where we going, man?
You serious?
I'm fucking family.
We're family!
That's right. Right.
We're a family.
- What's that?
- Inside's a passport...

Enough cash to make
a damn good life for yourself.
Now, you're gonna
get in that car,

to Dallas Fort Worth Airport

You don't even
stop to take a piss.
- You hear me?
- Yeah, I hear you.
Good luck, kid.
I'll tell you what, Barry.
I'm gonna send you a

You're gonna start sending

Man, man, I'm like

What is goin' on with JB?
Don't worry about JB.
What if he talks, man?
- He ain't gonna.
- Yeah, but what if he does?
- He ain't gonna talk, Bill.

I am fucking positive.
Okay, man.

Good.
<i>In calendar year, your

Yeah.
5,000 of which, have found
themselves in the hands

- Right, but...
- Out of the 916 Contras
brought in to the
United States to train,
only half made it back
to Nicaragua.
- Half is...
- The other half are in the wild...
What's going on here?
Yeah. We had to send
the Contras home.
- Home?
- Yeah.
They weren't fighting.
That's the reality
of that situation.
You know, it didn't help that
their guns were in Colombia.
Did it, Barry?
So...
What now?
We'll call you.
Call me?
Schafer?
Hey, Schafer.
Who the fuck's Schafer?
Okay, everybody.

Don't do this now.
Sir, sir, I'm sorry, no, no, no.
Come on, sir.
Excuse me,

Luce, you gotta stop. Hey.
You know, fellas!
Sorry, hey...
Can I just have a moment?
Can I just have a moment
with my wife?
It's been a hell of a day.
- Okay, Barry.
- Yeah.
You got one minute.
All right, Luce?
Honey, honey...
- Honey, listen to me.
<i>- Let's give him a minute.</i>
- Baby, baby, listen to me.
- All right, fellas, head on out.
Listen to me now.
Ima go to prison.

just a little time.
And Ima be fine there.
And we'll work everything out.
But I gotta know
you gonna be safe.
It's gonna be all right.
You gotta trust me.
You trust me, right?

<i>Luce and the kids finally
did move to Baton Rouge.</i>
How can we have a war on drugs...
when the biggest
enemy of the state
is being protected by our side?
<i>And that lady prosecutor...</i>
<i>She never ever did give up.</i>
Such sting operation
was underway.
The defendant will rise.
- Barry Seal.
- Your Honor.
You are sentenced to 1,000
hours community service.
Dismissed.
- That is bullshit.
- Watch yourself, Sibota.
- I'm sorry, community service?
- A drug smuggler of the highest order!
- Exhibit D!
- Mr. Seal's planes are classified.
- I'm sick to fuck of this Mickey Mouse...
- Sibota!
- Tactics and bullshit!
- Sibota!
I will hold you in contempt!
So I'm walkin' outta here?
Now?
The State of Arkansas
has spoken, Mr. Seal.
- Do I have to go?
- Goodbye.
<i>Listo pues.</i>
All right, <i>amigos</i>.
And...
I do tend to leap before I look.
Maybe...
Maybe I should've
asked a few more questions.
Excuse me, Sir, ma'am?
Would y'all mind
movin' out the way?
I'm just gonna start my car.
Yeah, I really appreciate that, now.
Honey, just keep walking.

You know, I guess you could say
I helped build an army.
Defend a country.
And create the biggest

Sometimes a little more

Pete became a rural pastor in

The CIA continued using
Barry's planes to arm the Contras.

Until one of them was
shot down in Nicaragua.
That sparked
the Iran-Contra scandal.
<i>Mr. President, what do you know
