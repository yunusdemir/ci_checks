Cobain Montage of Heck (2015)
English subtitle by Ayah Escandar.
To all Nirvana fans, enjoy! ;).
Hello, testing.
One, two...
Go-go juice.
- Hi.
- Or motion lotion.
Beaver.
Female.
Welcome to manned
space exploration.
The Mercury spacecraft is six feet
in diameter and nine feet tall.
Cos I don't like your face.
Hey.
Hey, come 'ere.
I want...
I want you to see something.
Kurt's brain was just
constantly going.
He was always thinking
about something.
I mean, there was always
something going on.
You could just see it.
Party on, Wayne.
It was awe-inspiring, but it was like,
"Oh, well, I guess I'm not... " You know?
"I guess I'm not all that special. "
But, you know...
But then, as I grew up,
I'm, like, I'm so glad I don't...
I never got that genius brain.
Maybe he just felt praise was
hard for him to take, maybe,
and he didn't know
how to handle that.
So he would downplay
it all the time.
But that was his goal, was to
get to as perfect as he could.
As good as he could get.
Write as well as he could,
sing as well as he could,
play as well as he could.
And then when it all came together...
It's so... I can't sit...
It's too painful.
This is too painful.
You're gonna make it, man.
With the support of his friends
and family, he's gonna make it.
And you see the art,
I mean, a lot of his messages
are as plain as day.
You just... I'm not even gonna say
what they are, but you can see it.
And it's all there. And, you know,
in 20/20 hindsight, you're like,
"Oh, my God, why didn't I see that?"
Or, "I should've said something. "
But, you know, it's like...
<i>Some say love</i>
<i>It is a river</i>
<i>When I was an alien</i>
<i>Cultures weren't opinions</i>
<i>Gotta find a way, a better way</i>
<i>When I'm there</i>
<i>Gotta find a way, a better way</i>
<i>A better way</i>
<i>Never met a wise man</i>
<i>If so, it's a woman</i>
<i>Gotta find a way, a better way</i>
<i>When I'm there</i>
<i>Gotta find a way, a better way</i>
<i>A better way</i>
<i>Gotta find a way, a better way</i>
<i>When I'm there</i>
<i>Gotta find a way, a better way</i>
<i>A better way</i>
<i>Gotta find a way, a better way</i>
<i>When I'm there</i>
<i>Gotta find a way, a better way</i>
Well, America was booming after the
war and everybody had everything.
Even if you didn't have much,
you still had enough.
Aberdeen was a logging town
and a mill town.
And it was booming.
<i>Wake up, little Susie</i>
You saw everybody downtown
paying their bills or shopping.
It was a lovely, awesome place
to raise children.
My kids loved that town.
<i>Wake up, little Susie, and weep</i>
<i>The movie's over, it's four o'clock
and we're in trouble deep</i>
<i>Wake up, little Susie</i>
<i>Wake up, little Susie</i>
So, Don was working at a
gas station over in Hoquiam.
You know, he had the black
horn-rimmed glasses
and his ears kind of
stuck out a little
and he had the crew cut,
and that's not good on anybody.
I kind of helped him
with everything.
He didn't really know what
he was doing with style.
I guess, like,
we were more friends.
I didn't know what falling in love was,
so I had never experienced it.
So I just thought because
I liked him, I loved him.
And so he got me an engagement
ring and we got engaged.
You know, it was fun!
I mean, it was like, "OK,
all those problems are behind me. "
"Now I'm gonna have babies!"
And I just couldn't wait
to get pregnant.
I mean, that was the goal.
And so I went to Dr Ehrhart
and he said, "You're so young. "
"You just need to get... get on
your feet with being a housewife. "
And, you know,
I just didn't listen to anybody.
I used to think,
"Why did I marry Don Cobain?"
And I was, like, no, everything
really did happen for a reason.
Kurt had to be born.
It was... it was a must.
He was the first grandchild
on both sides.
Everybody was coming
overconstantly.
I can't even describe
what a magnet he was.
People just came to him.
I was head over heels in
love with that child.
He was so kind and so
worried about people.
You know, if they were OK,
or if somebody got hurt.
And then, on top of that,
he started singing
and playing guitar.
And once he could draw,
he drew all the time.
- Let's sing now, Mom.
- OK. Say who you are.
Who are you?
Who are you, Kurt?
Who are you?
Who are you?
Goodbye!
I'm Kurt Cobain.
- Yay!
- Yay! Go! Go!
Kurt, he was full of energy.
Always busy.
And I had this old rocking chair
in the corner of the front room.
He'd be upside down
with his head hanging off
where your legs would be
and his feet up on the back
of the rocking chair
going 90 miles an hour in it.
Going so fast and it would be
hitting the back of the wall,
and he'd be repeating everything
verbatim off Sesame Street.
<i>Would you like
to hear my voice</i>
<i>Sprinkled with emotion</i>
And I thought,
"Before I have this next baby,
we've gotta try to get this one
to calm down. "
So I take him to the paediatrician,
Dr Fulton.
He did a rapid eye movement test
with a flashlight in his eyes,
and he went,
"OK, we got trouble here. "
And he said, "OK,
I'm gonna give you this tablet. "
And I believe it was
something like Ritalin.
So I gave it to him that night and,
oh, my God!
He just went off the rails.
<i>If I had to lose a mile</i>
<i>If I had to touch feelings</i>
<i>I would lose my soul</i>
<i>The way I do</i>
<i>I don't have to think</i>
#I only have to do it
<i>The results are always perfect</i>
<i>And that's old news</i>
<i>Would you like
to hear my voice</i>
#Sprinkled with emotion
Kurt, he was hyper.
Full of energy.
Always busy.
You know, jumping off of things,
knocking things over.
Anything that had to do
with being a normal child.
And Don, he didn't know
how to handle that.
He was one of those
kind of people
that just thought that children
should be seen and not heard
and shouldn't cause any trouble.
I mean, he belittled
and ridiculed Kurt.
And Kurt would be ashamed.
I mean, it really hurt him
to be embarrassed.
Then, I don't know.
I just... I started to mature.
You know, I started getting older,
and kind of looking back at...
Kind of the song that may
have even stirred this in me,
Is That All There Is?
You know, is this my life?
I haven't done anything with my life.
In those days,
people didn't get divorced.
I mean, I didn't know anybody
that was divorced.
You just... you were in the soup.
You didn't think about divorce.
Kurt was nine at the time.
And everybody was
talking about it.
It just embarrassed him to death
that we had gotten divorced.
He took light bulbs
out of all the lights
and locked the baby-sitter and Kim
outside and just became really unruly.
And I said, "This is not going
to happen any more. "
And so I took him over
to his dad's house.
She couldn't handle him.
So, I took him.
I liked it, really,
you know, having him,
him and I together like that.
And I think there's one thing
that I said at one time
that I was never gonna
get married again.
And I think he took
that for a word.
Then I met Jennifer
and we got married
and, you know, he had a stepbrother
and a sister and then our son, Chad.
He wanted to be in
a family, period.
And I felt that just
from the beginning.
The game nights that we had,
that was really important to him.
You know, if we didn't want to do it
on a Wednesday night,
you know, he'd say,
"Nope! We have to. That's what we... "
He just... I could feel that he
just really liked that time,
but he always wanted to win.
And if he didn't win, he was mad.
He wanted to be
the most loved
and it just wasn't
the ideal world
that he thought a
family should be.
So, he just decided he wasn't
gonna do anything anybody said.
He'd just lay on the
couch and watch TV.
Go down in his room
and play the guitar.
And then he started just doing
really mean things to the kids.
And then, it just got so...
I think it was kind of
my fault in a way
because I couldn't deal
with it any more.
And I told Don he was gonna
have to get out of the house.
He went to Wendy's
brother's for a while.
And with my mom and dad,
he even lived with them for a while,
you know, then he'd come back
to us and still have problems.
It was like nobody...
After a couple of weeks,
they wanted him out.
I think the sad part
of the whole thing
is that Kurt just really wanted
to be with his mom.
<i>Underneath the bridge</i>
<i>The tarp has sprung a leak</i>
<i>And the animals I've trapped</i>
<i>Have all become my pets</i>
<i>And I'm living off of grass</i>
<i>And the drippings
from the ceiling</i>
<i>It's OK to eat fish</i>
<i>Cos they don't
have any feelings</i>
<i>Something in the way</i>
<i>Something in the way, yeah</i>
<i>Something in the way</i>
<i>Something in the way, yeah</i>
He just was in so much pain
that he, you know,
took it out on his mom
and took it out on his dad
and took it out
on his siblings.
But it's almost
like he didn't...
He didn't feel worthy because
he was rejected, basically.
And I don't know
how anybody deals
with having your whole family
reject you.
<i>Like most babies
smell like butter</i>
<i>His smell smelled
like no other</i>
<i>He was born scentless
and senseless</i>
<i>He was born a
scentless apprentice</i>
<i>Go away</i>
<i>Get away</i>
<i>Go away</i>
In a community that stresses
macho male sexual stories
as the highlight of
all conversation,
I was an underdeveloped,
immature little dude that never got laid
and was constantly razzed.
Oh, poor little kid.
It bothered me, probably more so
because I was horny
and frequently had to
make up stories like,
"Oh, when I went on vacation,
I met this chick
and we fucked and she loved it,"
etcetera, etcetera.
This typical pubescent problem
was an effector in the
height of my problems
with my father and stepmom.
You know, the typical
wicked-stepmom story.
And so, I moved to
both grandparents'
and four sets of aunts' and uncles'
and so forth and so on within the year.
And in eighth grade, my mom
had no choice to take me in
because my dad
packed my stuff
and drove me to her house in
the morning and left me there.
She was pissed.
I accumulated quite a healthy complex,
not to mention a complexion.
Then one day, I discovered the most
ultimate form of expression ever:
Marijuana.
Oh, boy! Pot.
I could escape all day long and not
have routine nervous breakdowns.
Trevor was a guy I hated but
resorted to becoming friends with
because he was the only person
I could get pot from.
He was the kingpin.
Trevor, Ace, John and Darren,
all white-trash, lowlife scum
of the earth, according to the jocks,
had been going to this girl's house
after school, and they invited me.
We got to the door and
a very fat girl let us in.
It wasn't obvious to me
for over an hour
that this girl seemed
kind of quiet
until one of the guys pointed out
that she was in a special ed class.
I'm sure a lot of kids would call her
a retard and some just slow,
and at the time, and still to this day,
I would call her quiet and illiterate
but not retarded.
The object of the guys who had been
going there for the past month
was to steal booze from the downstairs
basement den of her house.
While others distracted her,
one would go down and take a fifth
and then exit out the downstairs.
So we'd do this routine
every otherday
and got away with it for, oh,
about a month.
And during that month
happened to be the epitome of my
mental abuse from my mother.
It turned out that pot didn't help me
escape my troubles too well any more,
and I was actually enjoying
doing rebellious things
like stealing booze and
busting store windows,
and nothing ever mattered.
I decided within the next month,
I'll not sit on my roof
and think about jumping,
but I'll actually kill myself.
And I wasn't going out of this world
without actually knowing
what it was like to get laid.
So one day after school,
I went to the girl's house alone
and invited myself in and she
offered me some Twinkies
and I sat on her lap
and I said, "Let's fuck. "
And I touched her tits and
she went into her bedroom
and got undressed in front of me,
and I watched and realised
that it was actually happening.
So I tried to fuck her
but didn't know how
and asked her if she'd
ever done this before.
And she said, "A lot of times,"
mainly with her cousin.
I got grossed out very heavily
with how her vagina smelled
and her sweat reeked, so I left.
My conscience grew to where
I couldn't go to school for a week,
and when I went back,
I got in-house suspension for skipping,
and that day,
the girl's father came in
screaming and accusing someone
of taking advantage of his daughter.
And so during lunch, a rumour started,
and by the next day,
everyone was waiting for me
to yell and cuss and spit at me,
calling me "the retard fucker".
I couldn't handle the ridicule,
so I got high and drunk and
walked down to the train tracks
and laid down and put two big pieces
of cement on my chest and legs
and I waited for the
11 o'clock train.
And the train came closer
and closer and closer,
and it went on the next track
besides me instead of over me.
The tension from school
had an effect on me
and the train scared me enough
to try to rehabilitate myself,
and my lifting weights and mathematics
seemed to be improving,
so I became less manically depressed,
but still never had any friends
because I...
I hated everyone,
for they were so phoney.
When Kurt was about 15,
he moved back in with Mom and I.
It was a struggle.
You know, it was still him
wanting to rebel
and getting stoned and
going out with his friends
and not wanting to,
you know, do chores
and, you know, he was always
wanting to, like, just do his own thing.
He wanted normalcy.
He wanted the mom, the dad
and the kids, and everything happy.
But then, he didn't,
cos he kinda fought against it.
So he fought against
what he really wanted.
- Hello? Hello?
- You still there?
Yeah. I'm putting you on
speaker phone, though.
OK. Are you recording this
or writing it down?
Yeah, I'm recording and writing.
People don't realise where we
really came from, you know?
What an isolated
hellhole it really is.
I mean, if witch burnings had been,
like, legal, we'd all be dead now.
- You know?
- Fuck, yeah.
Did you ever see that movie
"Over the Edge"?
- Yeah!
- I mean, God!
That movie had such
an effect on me.
OK, you guys. You are to take
these home to your parents.
It's to let them know about
a special emergency meeting
to discuss the problems
about you people.
I love that movie.
I always wanted to do that
in front of you.
Me, too. I tried, you know.
I wanted to be a vandal,
and I wanted to hold everyone
captive in the school.
Everybody that's ever messed
with me in one room.
That'd be just about
everybody in town.
We should go down there
and tell them all to go to hell.
- Yeah!
- Come on, man!
I don't know how many of us
are willing to admit
just how deep in trouble some
of the kids in this city are.
Has anyone ever sat down
and talked to these kids?
I talk to them six hours a day
until I'm blue in the face.
I spend more time with your
kids than you people do.
You think those kids are
interested in learning?
You ought to come in and see
what goes on in the classroom.
<i>Wouldn't you believe it
It's just my luck</i>
<i>Wouldn't you believe it
It's just my luck</i>
<i>Wouldn't you believe it
It's just my luck</i>
<i>Wouldn't you believe it
It's just my luck</i>
<i>No recess!</i>
<i>No recess!</i>
<i>No recess!</i>
Most of the teachers, God...
The last couple of years of school
in the mid-eighties,
there was so much Reagan
propaganda going on.
This teacher would just
go off on it every day.
Practise your piano.
- You need practice on it.
- Go to hell!
Burn the place to the
fucking ground.
Yeah!
<i>No recess!</i>
<i>No recess!</i>
<i>No recess!</i>
High school's such a
worthless fucking nothing.
God, what torture, you know?
No, I quit the last two
months of school.
I was so withdrawn
by that time,
and I was so antisocial that I
was almost insane, you know?
I felt so different and so crazy
that people just left me alone.
<i>No recess!</i>
Did Kurt find the underground
or did the underground find him?
I think he went in search of it
and I think they found each other.
He was searching for whatever
made him feel like he wasn't alone
and that he wasn't so different.
When did you first
hear punk rock?
You know, I'd wanted to
hear punk rock forever.
Of course, they didn't have it
in our record shop in Aberdeen.
But then finally, Buzz Osborne,
who'd been a friend of mine off and on,
made me a couple of
compilation tapes.
And I was completely
blown away.
I would lip sync to those
tapes and I wore them out
and I'd play them every day, you know.
It was the greatest thing.
It expressed the way
I felt socially and politically
and it was the anger that I felt,
the alienation.
And I realised that this is what
I've always wanted to do.
<i>Fill me in on your new vision</i>
<i>Wake me up with indecision</i>
<i>Help me trust your
mighty wisdom</i>
<i>Yes, I eat cow, I am not proud</i>
Just the fact that we were actually
playing music live in a room,
it was amazing. It was, like,
the most incredible thing I've ever done.
<i>Easy in an easy chair</i>
<i>Poop as hard as rock</i>
<i>I don't like you anyway</i>
<i>Seal it in a box</i>
If we played together in the
house for a couple of hours
and if two people stopped by,
we considered that a gig, you know.
A show.
That was good enough.
We had an audience
of two people, you know.
Locals who hated our guts and
thought it was terrible music.
I think I was 18 or 19 years old
and Kurt was, like, 17.
But he liked punk rock music, and so
that, you know, piqued my interest.
And then I noticed
what a good artist he was.
And so he was working
at the time as a janitor,
but he'd always have to, like,
do some kind of art,
usually defacing something.
He never had, like, idle hands.
It just came out of him.
He had to express himself.
Well, who taught you how
to play guitar anyway?
Brilliant.
Brilliant improvisational.
Wow, Jerry Garcia
would really like this.
- I'm gonna send him a tape.
- Send it to Jerry.
You just have to sprinkle it
with patchouli orsomething.
He'll dig right into it.
Wait, wait, wait.
Ready?
You alcoholics.
Film in the dark, you dick!
<i>Pick me, pick me, yeah</i>
<i>Live alone, lone single</i>
<i>At least, at least, yeah</i>
<i>Everyone is hollow</i>
<i>At least, at least, yeah</i>
<i>Everyone is playing</i>
<i>Pick me, pick me, yeah</i>
<i>You can even...</i>
<i>Yeah</i>
<i>Dive, dive, dive</i>
<i>Dive in me</i>
<i>Dive, dive, dive</i>
<i>Dive in me</i>
<i>Dive in me</i>
<i>Dive in me</i>
<i>Dive in me</i>
He really didn't want to live
with his mom or his dad.
He wanted to be on his own.
So he moves into this dump.
He wasn't making
a lot of money,
and I think he was scared,
not being able to pay his own way.
And in the hallway outside the apartment,
it was completely graffitied.
Scooby Doo.
Rocky and Bullwinkle.
But it was pornographic.
There was just no way he was
gonna be the nine-to-five work guy
that comes home with the briefcase
and wife cooks him dinner.
I mean, that just wasn't ever
gonna happen.
But he wanted some
type of connection.
This is love, this is love.
This is shitting and pissing
and fucking all over each other.
Licking and spitting up
Gerber baby food.
Not worrying if the plastic tarp
is on the floor cos, baby, this is love.
Well, I know some people
will say that...
that I treated Kurt maternally,
took care of him.
But I like to think it was more
I was trying to nurture him
rather than take care of him.
Trying to nurture who he was
and get him to...
let him do his art,
let him do his music
and encourage him to get better
at it as opposed to trying to stifle it.
But also not try to be the mom,
but trying to be a nurturing
girlfriend or friend.
We met at a party and, you know,
I liked him. I had a crush on him.
And then finally
someone told him,
"Don't you get that she likes you?"
or something.
Cos he was just kinda
clueless about it.
I liked that he was funny.
He made me laugh.
He wasn't afraid to be,
you know, goofy or silly.
But mostly we just had
a good time hanging out.
I think he might have been a bit angry
at the way he was treated at school
and angry with his mom
and with his dad.
I think it was not so much that it
was hard for him to accept love
but the fact that maybe he
was afraid of getting hurt.
He was living in this tiny
little house in Aberdeen.
I just said, "Why don't you just
move in with me and be in Olympia?"
So we moved in together.
It was nice to have someone
to share the evening with
as well as the daytime.
Sitting on the couch at the same time,
each reading a book.
It was just...
you kind of felt grown up
as opposed to just being still,
you know, a teenager.
I'd like to think he was happy.
We were very much
in love with each other,
and, like I said,
I just tried to support him
because he wanted
to be a musician.
He wanted, you know,
to get his band going.
He was ambitious. He didn't want to
just be playing in a bar band, you know,
and play music that way.
He wanted to be a success.
Good luck, good luck, man.
Good luck.
Part the Red Seas.
Shut the fuck up!
<i>Bell on door clanks, come on in</i>
<i>Floyd observes my hairy chin</i>
<i>Sit down in the chair,
don't be afraid</i>
<i>Steamed hot towel on my face</i>
<i>I was shaved</i>
<i>I was shaved</i>
<i>I was shaved</i>
<i>Barney ties me to the chair</i>
<i>I can't see, I'm really scared</i>
<i>Floyd breathes hard,
I hear a zip</i>
<i>Pee-pee pressed
against my lips</i>
<i>I was shamed</i>
<i>I was shamed</i>
<i>I was shamed</i>
OK, thanks, everybody, for coming.
When I met him,
he was a handyman.
And then he got a
job as a janitor,
cleaning, like, doctor's offices and
dentist's offices and things like that.
But, yeah, he just ended up not
having another job after that.
- So who would support him?
- Me.
And what would he do all day
while you were at work?
It was funny cos sometimes he'd just
sit there and watch TV for four hours
and you'd think he
wasn't creating,
but he'd be playing guitar while he was
doing that or think up stuff later
and then you'd go out for a few
hours and you'd come back
and there was a painting on the wall or
there's a big comic strip or whatever;
he wrote a song, you know,
and recorded it.
...described them
arriving at this scene...
This is, like, fucking rad,
you know.
Co-o-o-ol.
Where's the m-m-m-m...
M - m - m - m - m - m...
<i>I could be a girl,
she can breed me</i>
<i>I can be a boy,
she could break free</i>
<i>I don't even care</i>
<i>We could be all three</i>
<i>She said</i>
Warm babies on my cold feet
at the end of my bed.
I want you to see something.
Shh!
They're in the house.
They're in the house.
Some highlights follow,
but we warn that viewers may find
parts of the footage disturbing.
The object of the exercise
is to observe the monster
for as long as possible.
<i>Think I'll go for a walk
outside now</i>
<i>The summer sun's
calling my name</i>
<i>I hear you now, I just
can't stay inside all day, d-d-day</i>
A person who is
success-minded
has a success consciousness and...
<i>- Everybody's smiling
- ... success awareness.</i>
<i>Into the sunshine</i>
Why is that so groovy?
<i>She should have
been a son</i>
Hello?
No, she's not.
She went to work.
Alright.
Bass part.
<i>Na, na-na na, na-na na,
na-na na</i>
A person who is success minded
has a success consciousness
and suc-suc-suc-suc-suc...
Boy, am I gonna
wake you up.
N - N - N - N -
Now c'mon.
You know this is really the
best way to start your day.
Now don't think about anything else
but getting that body in shape
cos you deserve it.
Now hold the stomach in. C'mon.
Gimme some good posture.
Hold your head up high.
Tighten those buns.
Get ready because this is for you!
<i>She said she'd take
me anywhere</i>
<i>She'd take me anywhere</i>
#As long as she stays with me
<i>She said she'd take
me anywhere</i>
<i>She'd take me anywhere</i>
<i>As long as I stayed clean</i>
<i>Kiss, kiss Molly's lips</i>
<i>Kiss, kiss Molly's lips</i>
<i>Kiss, kiss Molly's lips</i>
<i>Kiss, kiss Molly's lips</i>
This song has two notes.
That's it.
This note and this note.
<i>She said she'd take

<i>She'd take me anywhere</i>
<i>As long as she stays with me</i>
<i>She said she'd take

Look at these losers.
Bunch of long-haired
fuckin' sissies, man.
Hi, my name is Dana.
I caught Nirvana in their dressing
room on their recent tour.
At what point are you
on this tour right now?
We're at the point of
kicking each other's ass.
I would imagine that the constant
party atmosphere on the road
would create a great deal of
physical and mental stress.
How do you deal with it?
We prepared for the rock and
roll lifestyle. We can kick it, man.
You know what? We should move in
our stuff before it starts raining.
Yeah.
A hundred percent humidity
here in Fort Worth, Texas.
Does success ever frighten you?
Go in the van!
Hey!
No, because we actually want
to become more successful
so we can have a
comfortable life.
OK, man.
Take it away, buddy.
Don't worry about me. I know this is
kind of a strange angle, but it'll work.
Yes. That's a big camera, man.
That's not...
How would you describe the music
you play and the things you do?
Well, the things we do is just,
we play a very powerful,
high-energy type of rock and roll.
We move around on
stage a lot, and...
Just scream with an abandon,
I guess.
What makes you
want to be Nirvana?
What makes us want
to be Nirvana?
We're Nirvana because we're
not Aerosmith or something.
Or the Vegetables.
Or...
What's the future of Nirvana?
The future of Nirvana?
I don't know.
Hopefully try to write
some more good songs.
That's all we care about
is writing good music.
If we get popular or not,
it doesn't matter.
The music's more important.
We don't have any more songs,
so this is the last one.
<i>Would you believe me when I tell you
You are the queen of my heart?</i>
<i>Please don't deceive me
when I hurt you</i>
<i>Just ain't the way it seems</i>
<i>Can you feel my love buzz?</i>
I remember the first review
Nirvana ever got
was for the Love Buzz/Big Cheese
single we did,
and it was in this hip magazine out of
Michigan these scenesters were doing,
and they gave us
a bad review.
They said it was like Lynyrd
Skynyrd but without the flares.
Kurt was really hurt with that
and he was telling me that.
He goes... And I said,
"Don't worry about it. "
"That's just... they're just scenesters,
they're hipsters or... "
You know, "Screw them!"
or whatever.
But, you know,
Kurt hated being humiliated.
He hated it.
He hated it!
If he ever thought he was humiliated,
then you'd see the rage come out.
And so he was also
very careful about,
and stubborn about how the way the
art and the work was presented
because he didn't want
to be humiliated.
I could be humiliated, like...
I humiliate myself or whatever.
But not Kurt.
No.
He had really violent
dreams a lot.
People would be breaking
into his house, trying to kill him,
and he'd have to stab them.
Once in a while it might be his
family who was trying to kill him.
But that was just really rare.
Usually it was someone else coming
after him that he didn't know.
I asked... I thought he should
try to talk to someone,
but without, you know, much money,
that really wasn't gonna happen.
Kurt would get stomach aches
a lot and say his stomach hurt.
You know, he'd be feeling fine
and then he'd get out of the car
and just be, like,
"I gotta throw up. "
I know he went to the doctor once
or twice, but it didn't really work.
Most of the time,
I sing right from my stomach.
Right where my stomach pain is.
Every time I've had an endoscope,
they'd find a red irritation.
I would sing and cough up blood.
It's, like, this is no way
to live a life.
I love to play music but
something's not right.
So I decided to medicate myself.
How much of that
pain would you say
actually fuels what you're
writing and playing?
See, that's a scary question
because I think it probably helps,
you know.
But I would give up everything
to have good health.
But then again, I'm always afraid
that if I lost the stomach problem,
I might not be as creative.
There's a journal entry where
Kurt mentions doing heroin
for the first time in 1987
when he was living with you.
See, he never told me that.
He totally had kept that from me cos
I totally would've talked him out of it.
In fact, he used to make fun of
some of the people in Seattle
that were using that and
say it was really stupid.
Cos I've been told before that he
was doing it when we were dating,
but I'm, like, he didn't do
it around me, ever.
I never found anything, so...
I can't really say exactly
why we broke up.
I just know that we
were fighting more
and he was staying away
from the house more.
I think he just pretty much didn't
love me as much as he used to.
Or felt... He just felt like maybe
he was moving ahead and I wasn't.
Kurt Cobain's here.
You know,
Kurt Cobain from Aberdeen.
- What's going on, baby?
- Not a damn thing.
You called up and said,
"I wanna play some songs. "
So I said, "Rockin' good news!"
Bloody brilliant!
I just wrote most of the lyrics
this evening.
- In the car, on the way up here?
- While I was driving with one foot.
- Uh-huh?
- Yeah, that's what I did.
I just thought I would just
come here and say hi.
Well, let her rip.
OK, is there any major-label
interest in you at the present?
- Can you say?
- Not at the moment.
Anybody not affiliated with CBS.
Would you consider changing?
We're considering it because we
wanna get as much as we can.
Well, you're this
interesting mix of,
as you say, you're one of the
laziest people you know,
but you're also ambitious
for a lazy person.
You think so?
How does it feel to be surrounded
by so many people
telling you that you soon
are doing very well?
I think it's embarrassing to
have so many expectations.
A totally superficial label
to put on a band,
to state that they're
the next big thing.
Because, you know,
that's not our goal in the first place.
People are putting that tag on us
without us really wanting to do that.
You're not prepared forthat?
Not prepared? Nope.
Because we're not going to be.
We're prepared to destroy
our careers if it happens.
<i>I'm so happy</i>
<i>Cos today I've found my friends</i>
<i>They're in my head</i>
<i>I'm so ugly</i>
<i>But that's OK, cos so are you</i>
<i>We've broken our mirrors</i>
<i>Sunday morning</i>
<i>Is everyday for all I care</i>

<i>Light my candles</i>

<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>
<i>Yeah</i>
<i>I'm so lonely</i>
<i>But that's OK,
I shaved my head</i>
<i>And I'm not sad</i>
<i>And just maybe</i>
<i>I'm to blame for all I've heard</i>
<i>But I'm not sure</i>
<i>I'm so excited</i>
I am Kurt.
I play guitar and I sing.
And I am Dave.
And I play drums.
And I sing sometimes
but not that often.
I'm Chris and I play bass.
And I don't sing, thank God!
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>
Alright, Nirvana's joined us in the
studio tonight. New Music Hour.
We've got Krist Novoselic,
we've got Kurt Cobain and Dave Grohl.
Their upcoming release Nevermind
comes out the 24th of this month,
and you guys'll be
doing an in-store
at the Beehive Music and Video
in the University District.
So go out, meet the band.
That's at seven to nine.

End of July or August, he's home.
And he comes downstairs and
he's in his little whitey tighties.
No shirt.
Barefoot.
No pants other than his undies and...
Very Don Cobain.
That's anotherthing
I got sick of looking at.
And he's standing there with this tape
in his hand. I go, "What's that?"
And he goes, "It's the master cut
to my new album. "
"Can I put it on the stereo?"
And I go,
"Yeah! And turn it up! Up, up, up. "
Because I listen to
music really loud.
And I look at him and I go,
"Oh, my God!"
"Oh, my God!"
And I almost start crying.
I mean, not from happiness.
From fear. It was fear.
And I just went...
"This is going to
change everything. "
And I said...
"You better buckle up,
cos you are not ready for this. "
And for someone like yourself,
when you're, sort of,
let's say your dreams come true,
all the worst aspects of them
come true as well.
It's, like, be careful what you wish for.
You're gonna get it.
Yeah.
How do you sort of deal
with the pull-apart;
you know, being pulled apart
by stuff like that?
I don't know if I expressed
that the right way or not.
Well...
Er...

OK, and cut.
Alright, that's a wrap.
Hey, man, if this bird goes down,
this is the safest place to be.
Right in the tail,
where the bathroom is.
As soon as you walked
on this plane
I took one gander at you and
I saw nothing but trouble.
Ha!
Bah!
See if you can try and do it.
Me and my sidekick Tree Frog Johnson
here is gonna rip you a new butthole.
- Is this time ourtime?
- What a sensitive man.
Cos it says it's, like,
almost three in the morning.
Time flies when you're
having fun.

That Nirvana stuff you
played last night?
If I wanted to request one of their
songs now, could you play it?
You don't have any bootleg
CDs of Nirvana?
Could you play some Nirvana?
Right here, a world premiere video
from Nirvana.
Smells Like Teen Spirit.
<i>Even if you have</i>

What do we say?
We're Nirvana and this
is The Week in Rock.
Hey, all you people staying
up late on a Sunday night.
Slack off!
You don't need your job.
Don't say, "Yes, sir. Yes, ma'am. "
Say, "Cram it!"
Don't show up tomorrow,
call in sick, cos this is Nirvana,
- and you're watching...
- 120 Minutes.

The hottest new rock band in the country
right now may well be Nirvana.
The hottest band
at the moment.
The band it seems everybody's
talking about.
People, like, really seem to be
getting into Nirvana right now.
Do you see when you go out
and play shows
that the crowds are
getting different?
- Isn't it pretty overwhelming?
- Everybody wants to be hip.
- And so that's what it is, then?
- Everyone wants to be accepted.
Yeah?
OK. Cool.
I've just heard that you've sold
600,000 albums in the United States.
Does that make it platinum,
something like that?
It makes it gold.
It makes it a free gift to
my motherfor Christmas.
- Exactly!
- Don't have to pay for a gift.
What's Mom getting for Christmas?
I guess she's getting a gold record.
Does that mean you guys
are, like, rich now?
Hell, no! We're so far
from having any money.
I mean, we get per diem, I guess.
Do you care what critics think?
I've never heard as many
sort of glowing criticism...
- Oh, glowing!
- Does that make you feel good?
Well, I mean, it's better than
being slammed, that's forsure.
But, you know,
if I was reading the same thing about
another band, I wouldn't believe it.
No way.
I'm not gonna believe
some journalist
that's just spewing about some band
that he thinks changed his life or...
You can't believe
everything you read.
I mean, all you have to do is...
Music is a personal experience.
You put the music on and
whatever you get out of it,
you know, if it's good or bad.
If it's bad, you don't like it,
you just walk away from it, you know.
And if it's good,
it works for you...
- You know this lighter...
- What the hell.
There are probably a lot of kids
who hear your songs
and actually feel, like, kinship,
whether you're having trouble
with parents or with school
or, you know, the usual
dysfunctional stuff that happens.
But when you're up there,
do you have any sense
of who you're playing to?
I'm playing to kids in general.
I mean, it doesn't matter
where they come from.
We have the same problems
and we all basically have the
same thoughts, you know?
<i>One baby to another says</i>
<i>I'm lucky to have met you</i>
<i>I don't care what you think</i>
<i>Unless it is about me</i>
<i>It is now my duty to
completely drain you</i>
<i>I travel through a tube</i>
<i>And end up in your infection</i>
<i>Chew your meat for you</i>
<i>Pass it back and forth</i>
<i>In a passionate kiss</i>
<i>From my mouth to yours</i>
<i>I like you</i>
You guys don't like explaining
anything to do with your music.
What's the problem with
going on camera and just...
There's nothing to be said.
It's all in the music, man.
It's all in the music.
It's all in the meat!
You don't think that people
that are fans of you
would like to hear what you had
in mind, maybe? Or what you were...
I'd rather hear what they
have in mind, you know?
Like, how they interpret it.
In Teen Spirit,
you seem to complain
about the apathy
of our generation.
And do you share this lack
of engagement yourself?
- What, being apathetic?
- Yeah.
- Sure.
- Why?
Why?
Because we sleep too much.
- I mean, just say it.
- Just read it.
Hello!
Stay tuned for more...
...ew, Nirvana on ABC in concert!
- You want to do more?
- One more?
Yeah, do one more.
<i>With eyes so dilated</i>
<i>I've become your pupil</i>
<i>You've taught me everything</i>
Probably the biggest band in the world
right now, please welcome Nirvana!
Nirvana are real.
There's nothing pretentious about
them or anything like that.
They're world famous, you know.
Everyone wants to see Nirvana.
Kurt Cobain, he's so beautiful!
<i>Sloppy lips to lips</i>
<i>You're my vitamins</i>
<i>I like you</i>
Interviews are worthless.
Let's go!
- What do you think about interviews?
- What do I think?
Did you hear my reaction when
he asked me if I wanted to do one?
- Yes.
- I said, "no. "
I'm a hardcore Nirvana fan myself.
Yeah? Is this a disease you've
had long? Any cure for it?
He's talking from his experiences.
He's talking from his experience?
- Well, he's got lousy experience, sir.
- It was not his goal
to make millions of dollars when he made
the stuff. He's writing about his life.
Well, his life needs to see
a therapist or a minister,
and it doesn't need to be
on millions of CDs
for kids to listen to
and identify with
and have more of their despair
and their hopelessness emphasised
by the tragedy of
this man's life.
I guess each individual
is gonna deal with it
the way they're gonna deal with it.
I get, you know...
It was kind of traumatic to
be famous all of a sudden,
especially coming from
this complete obscurity
and just being the, like,
number-one band in the world.
So I do things like withdraw,
drink, you know.
I'm lucky. I had beer and wine,
you know. Kurt had heroin.
Given how volatile
and complicated
things were for Kurt
around that time,
why do you think he chose that moment
to start his relationship with Courtney?
I went... I had this relationship
with this person, this woman.
And I just kind of wanted to
build this home for myself,
cos my home, growing up,
had fallen apart,
so I wanted to build a home.
And I think that Kurt
wanted to do that, too.
He wanted to build a home because
his home and his family fell apart.
So when Courtney came
into his life, they had...
She was interesting,
she was artistic, intellectual.
And, you know,
she did drugs, too.
But that was all part of the
package of building a home.
Check, check, check,
check, check, check, check.
Let's watch theirsound check,
shall we?
Maybe it'll bug them and
they'll play really bad.
So you're having a relationship
with the guitar player?
No?
It was a short love affair?
I don't know what it was.
Honestly.
- It's over?
- I think, yeah.
- What happened?
- I don't care.
We're making a movie.
- Did you curl your hair?
- You don't like it?
It's nicer when it's straight
because it doesn't make
your face look so round.
Oh, my God!
Hello?
How is it on stage?
Is it clear on stage?
<i>Now, if she ever

<i>Aah, she's made

<i>She says, "Oh"</i>
He was super cute,
but he carried himself like
someone who didn't know that.
And that was part
of the charm.
He didn't know that he was a
better-looking guy than Brad Pitt.
We got on like a house
on fuckin' fire.
One caveat.
I had already done heroin,
beat the thing, had a rule,
I loved it still, but I didn't have
a fantasy that he had.
He had a fantasy.
His fantasy was,
"I'm gonna get to three million dollars,
then I'm gonna be a junkie. "
That was his...
those are his words.
<i>Come as you are</i>
<i>As you were</i>
<i>As I want you to be</i>

<i>Take your time, hurry up</i>
<i>The choice is yours</i>
<i>Don't be late</i>
There he is, he's against the wall.
Oh, my God!
He's totally trapped back there.
Is it fun to be famous?
People who are really famous
end up total recluses
and they don't do anything.
That sucks.

The money,
the attention, the hype.
Kurt Cobain,
an overnight spokesman
for many disaffected
young people.
A spokesman for a generation.
To his generation, he's the closest
they have to John Lennon.
The money, the attention,
the hype, the hysteria.
It's not my fault.
I never wanted the fame.
Seattle's own Nirvana
finds itself at the very top
of Billboard's pop albums chart
with its album Nevermind,
while guitarist Kurt Cobain just
got engaged to Courtney Love,
front woman of an
LA band called Hole.
According to Rolling Stone,
Cobain fell ill with a stomach problem
during their tour of four continents
and had to cancel a number
of dates in England.
There's been speculation
of summer tour plans,
but so far only the next
Reading Festival in August.
Nirvana is now retreating
from doing interviews.
Whether it's a reaction
to too much too soon,
the band would rather
their music speak for itself
than be knighted as spokesmen
for a generation.
Right after you
guys got married,
they were the biggest band in the world,
and Kurt decided to take six months off.
So, officially, in the story
that's out in the world,
he took six months off
of their touring schedule?
He could've toured the world
and made a shitload of money.
Oh, I see.
It seemed he wanted to stay in an
apartment with you and do heroin.
Yeah, he wanted to stay in an
apartment and do heroin and paint.
And play his guitar.
That's what he wanted to do.
Hi.
Hi.
This is our house.
This is where we live.
I know it looks disgusting now,
but sometimes it's nice.
I have to really clean it,
cos no one else fucking does.
OK, this is the toilet.
This is...
- This is me.
- Courtney.
- Hello?
- Do we have a turkey baster?
What?
Why do you think that everyone thinks
you're the good one and I'm the bad one?
Because I know how
to use my illusion.
Where are you going?
I'm going into my living room!
I paid for this.
Put on the dancing
merry chimp!
So is this the living room that that guy
described in Rolling Stone magazine?
Nothing but a Twin Reverb amp
and teddy bears to keep him company.
- Where's Eric?
- The chimp.
Hi, honey.
- Hi.
- I love you, love.
You are so cute.
Here, Eric, you film for a while.
This is the Kurt Cobain
action figure.
Secret coded message
in his guitar.
Kurt, I think he looks remarkably
a lot like you. Look at that.
I've had that since I was a child.
And he's playing what looks
to be a sort of Mosrite-y, vintage...
Come into the breakfast nook!
- Are you filming us?
- Uh-huh.
<i>She gives me everything</i>
<i>And tenderly</i>
<i>The kiss my lover brings</i>
<i>She brings to me</i>
<i>And I love her</i>
<i>Bright are the
stars that shine</i>
<i>Dark is the sky</i>

<i>Will never die</i>
<i>And I love her</i>
<i>A love like ours</i>
<i>Will never die</i>
<i>As long as I</i>
<i>Hold you near me</i>
Did you guys want
to have a baby?
Oh, God, yes.
Yes, we wanted to have a baby.
And I conceived Frances in December.
So I was pregnant
when I got married, yes.
We were all we had,
so making a family as fast as possible
was, you know, important. You know?
So, I mean, if I had
had more time,
I'm telling you, I'd have
had more kids with him.
Why do you feel so bad?
- Why?
- Uh-huh.
Because I want to.
It's my fault.
- All my fault.
- You're beautiful.
- I think you're really cute.
- Thank you.
So do a lot of Sassy readers.
I married Bobby Sherman.
Do you think they
do this to me?
What?
Do you think they do this to
me when they read Sassy?
Girls don't masturbate
over their teen idols.
They don't?
No. They make up more intricate,
schematic plans.
Girls are a lot more
complex than boys.
You don't know what
girls do to each other.
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.
They're vicious.
It's, like, you can know about
crafty girls all you want,
but I wouldn't let you go
on tour with crafty girls
because fucking doesn't
fucking matter, man.
They...
They...
They diss me.
They diss me all the time.
I'd be fat. I can't... I know,
it's not even like I can't trust you.
It's just you can't trust men
in general,
even, even if they're new men
and they're you.
Even if they're like you,
you still can't trust them.
I understand what you're
trying to say, but I don't agree.
I'm a new man. I'm a man for the '90s.
I'm Ward Cleaver.
And then, you being you,
you'd be all sensitive,
and you'd go, "How are we
gonna tell Courtney?"
Meanwhile, I've ruined my career,
ruined my life,
become the most hated woman
in America.
You were already the most
hated woman in America.
What?
You and Roseanne Barr tied for being
the most hated woman in America.
OK, I married Bobby Sherman,
I'm the most hated woman,
ruined my body,
not played the Reading Festival this
year when I could've kicked your ass.
You should still play
the Reading Festival.
Oh, yeah. So I should just play
the Reading Festival.
- Dive into the crowd.
- Right, that's right.
Shoot off a gun,
light yourself on fire.
Everyone wants to see this.
And this is only half of it.
- The rest is yet to come.
- Look. Moustache!
I kind of like that.
Free moustache rides!
It's a womb broom.
- Keep it, please!
- OK!
- Just keep it for the night.
- No way!
Please, Kurt, you need...
This is the...
<i>Outshined, outshined,
outshined!</i>
This is the look of Aberdeen.
Come on, look at the camera!
I was in Vietnam,
you weren't in Vietnam.
I was in Vietnam!
Look at my large breasts.
"Dearest Sassy,
and whoever else is responsible for
the Kurt Cobain-Courtney pig story. "
"Your story in April's Sassy about
Kurt Cobain and that Courtney hag
truly made me want to vomit. "
"First of all, what could have been
a beautiful interview experience
with Kurt Cobain,
the god of love in human form,
was totally ruined by nasty old dirty
Ms Love running her big fat mouth. "
"Who cares about her
stupid Victorian house
or her sucky band or how she
was so obnoxious and pushy
that she scared poor Kurt
into going out with her?"
"Secondly, you guys are supposed
to be understanding and all that,
so what possessed you to be
so insensitive to those of us
who would lick the ground
Kurt Cobain walked on?"
"You could have just mentioned
the vile Courtney,
but oh no, you went so far as to
show her kissing Kurt. Blech!"
"I will never forgive you.
Never, never, never!"
"Sincerely disillusioned with life,
Stacy, the Kurt slave. "
And there's a little happy
face on the bottom.
"Happy face. This is not currently me,
thanks to you. "
Why don't you interview us?
"Kurt and Courtney: Sassy II. "
How does it feel to be fast?
Like, in the fast lane?
At the height of
their drug abuse...
Damn, if I wasn't
so needle sick,
I'd be on tour with
Guns N' Roses right now.
Me and Axl would be whooping it up,
snake dancing across speakers.
Snake dancing across the stage
together singing Nazareth songs.
But I'm too goddamn
needle sick, man.
Are you fucked up, baby?
<i>You will see, you and me</i>
<i>Kurt, please, be with me</i>
<i>I want to be
your girlfriend</i>
<i>Let me just be
your girlfriend</i>
<i>Let me just be
your girlfriend</i>
<i>Well, I put it in my ass
and it kind of was painful</i>
<i>Well, I put it in my anus
and that was heinous</i>
<i>I put it in my anus
and it kind of was heinous</i>
<i>But I put it in my belly
and it kind of was smelly</i>
<i>And I want to be
your girlfriend</i>
<i>I want to be your girlfriend</i>
<i>I want to ride your
bratmobile, baby</i>
<i>I want to know how
you really feel, yeah</i>
<i>I want to ride in
your bratmobile</i>
<i>I want to shoot up
in your bratmobile</i>
<i>Cos put it in my butt
and we're having sex, but...</i>
I did do heroin when I was
pregnant, and then I stopped.
And I knew she would be fine.
Come on!
So, he was never concerned
that our child would have...
I assured him that I
was built like an oxen
and could carry this pregnancy to
term and not have any problems.
But, you know,
I was a young woman.
The pregnancy isn't the problem.
It's the being around a junkie while
I'm pregnant when I'm a junkie, too,
and I know the minute
that baby's out,
I'm gonna go shoot up
in celebratory fashion.
You know what I mean?
Like, that was our lifestyle.
Ten wars ago,
the sea monkeys were present.
The sea monkeys were hatched
and it begins,
and he said,
"You little girl. "
They found the little girl
stewing under his yellow
cigarette-stained fingernails.
<i>And if you say your prayers</i>
<i>You will make God happy</i>
<i>And if you do what's true</i>
<i>You will make me happy</i>
<i>I'll keep you in a jar</i>
<i>And you will seem happy</i>
<i>I'll give you breathing holes</i>
<i>You will think
you're happy now</i>
Does that get to you,
to read things, like, you know,
you're dying of smack addiction
or shit like that?
Yeah, it makes you feel
like the kid in school
who gets picked
on all the time.
Or it makes you feel
like the school slut.
Party on, Wayne.
I feel like people
want me to die
because it'd be the classic
rock and roll story.
I would like to officially
and publicly announce
that this is our last show.
There's been some pretty extreme
things written about us,
especially my wife, and she thinks
everybody hates her now.
So why don't you give her a message
and say, "Courtney, we love you"?
OK? Ready?
On the count of three.
One, two, three...
Courtney, we love you!
Thanks.

Hi.
Hi.
How you doing?
Are you getting suspicious
with this weird electronic device
in your face?
Staring right at it. Wait,
what do you see in there? Nothing.
Would you show your butt for the cam...?
Oh, a little wet, OK. A little pee.
That is most definitely amphibian.
Don't look at me.
Don't...
Frances, this is your real problem.
Everywhere Daddy looks,
you won't look.
- Hi, hi.
- Look at Dad.
This is the happiest baby I've
ever seen. Don't you think?
No! No, she's got lots of
things in store for her.
You want to be a star
for a while and I'll film?
You want to be the star?
Fly.
Want to fly?
Fly?
Nose.
Tastes good?
Want to barf in my mouth again?
Three times is the charm.
- Are you getting all this?
- Yes!
- Aren't we lucky?
- I know.
Are you worried about
the kind of mistakes
that might have been made
when you were growing up
that sort of impacts on how
you deal with her situation?
No. My father and I are
completely different people.
I know that I'm capable of showing
a lot more affection than my dad was.
I mean, even if Courtney
and I were to get a divorce,
I would never allow us
to be in a situation
where there are bad vibes
between us in front of her.
If there's anything
we're determined to do,
it's to give Frances
as much love as we can.
I mean, if anything is going to stop me
from pursuing this rock and roll thing,
it's going to be her
because I don't want her to
be screwed up because of it.
I don't know what's going to
happen in the next few years.
It's kind of scary.
- I dropped it.
- Mommy's loud.
I'm loud.
Oh, who's a big crybaby?
Oh, look at that.
She's... She's kind of upset!
OK, let's get her naked.
That's what I want. I want you naked.
Nirvana, who the fuck
do you think you are?
- Ew!
- Seeing your interviews
makes me think you guys are the most
immature pieces of trash ever made.
If you assholes could
ever write anything
that could come close to anything
Guns N' Roses has written,
maybe you could talk.
But until you sell a few
billion more albums,
take your head out of your
asses and smell the air.
It smells like Guns N' Roses.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
OK, enough of cute voices.
Leave me alone,
I have to read this now.
Especially you!
Don't look at me.
Don't look at me.
Hey, yeah.
In an isolation tank
on 50 hits of Demerol,
as New Age music
poisons the scarce, humid air.
Tonight from Hollywood,
we bring you a most unusual broadcast,
starring a famous radio couple
who have never before appeared
in a story of this kind.
This is Kurt Cobain.
I have a lot of things
to say to you.
A lot of fucking things
to say to you.
You parasitic little
fucking cunt.
You're not writing
about my band.
You're writing about how
jealous you are of my wife.
You have absolutely no fucking
idea what you're doing.
You will find out.
I don't care if this is a recorded threat.
I'm at the end of my rope.
I've never been more
fucking serious in my life.
Everything we do to develop
personal courage, confidence,
and belief in our own abilities.
Make your determination
so strong
that it will eliminate any
situation or circumstance
which stands in the
way of your goal.
Check, check, check, check, check.
This looks just like
the Metallica video.
This is part of your
rockumentary.
I think this album is a...
It really expresses
the way we feel inside.
You can't just do what
you do on stage.
You can't.
You're making an album.
Frances!
Frances, Frances, Frances!
Ah!
OK, OK.
I have to... They're calling me.
I have to work now. Take care, baby.
Well, rock on!
Daddy's got to go rock!

You said before, let's make a record
to lose most of your audience.
I was in the beginning,
about a year and a half ago.
I was completely fed up
with the whole thing.
I didn't want to be
a rock star at all.
It was just...
It was freaking me out, you know?
But I've had two years
to recuperate.
<i>That legendary divorce
is such a bore</i>
<i>As my bones grew
they did hurt</i>
<i>They hurt really bad</i>
<i>I tried hard to have a father</i>
<i>But instead I had a dad</i>
<i>I just want you to know that I</i>
<i>Don't hate you any more</i>
<i>There is nothing I could say</i>
<i>That I haven't thought before</i>

<i>Serve the servants, oh no</i>

Nirvana's third album,
In Utero,
a record with a decidedly
hard-edged sound,
courtesy of maverick producer,
Steve Albini,
will make its debut at number one
on Monday's new Billboard pop chart.
Nirvana will be starting a US tour
at the Arizona State Fair.
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>
<i>Happy birthday, dear Frances</i>
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>
You're one!
You're one! One year old!
- OK, what's this?
- We got something to do.
This is great!
Alright!
Kurt! You can't leave!
Come back!
Would you like some cake?
I'm not opening this
till you come back.
- Kurt?
- I'm bored.
Kurt?
It's Frances's first haircut.
Alright, I'm going to take the
chair out. Put her on the throne.
Let me do that.
Should I do it right here?
Kurt? Sit her on the throne.
Where's the scissors? You got 'em?
- Somebody's gotta hold her.
- I can do it.
No, I'm doing the haircut.
Yes, I am!
You aren't very
still with her.
Yes, I am.
I'm doing the haircut.
I don't really talk, just...
Jesus Christ.
- OK.
- You are such a good baby.
Shall I go down
and get a bowl?
Will you try and find the
classical station on there?
This is your Cartier comb.
That's right.
You haven't been eating a lot.
You don't feel like a bloated child.
Yeah, you gotta force
her to eat lately.
She's been sick.
Well, you really have
to force her to eat.
She's not...
She's not motivated.
We don't have any milk
in the house either.
I'm tired of telling everyone.
It's, like, a big deal.
I'm so tired.
Can't keep my eyes open.
Stop it!
Kurt, you don't want our daughter
to see you behaving like this, on drugs.
- I'm not on drugs! I'm tired!
- Do you have more teeth?
See? See?
Wife beating.
Here we go.
Oh, my pretty girly locks!
You look so gorgeous.
You won't be able to believe it.
You won't be able
to believe it.
<i>Amazing grace!</i>
<i>How sweet the sound</i>
<i>That saved a wretch...</i>
<i>like me</i>
<i>I once was lost</i>
<i>But now am found</i>
<i>Was blind</i>
<i>But now I see</i>
It just...
Every week, it got worse.
And sometimes he would come home,
I think, to hide.
And it was really bad.
He started getting sores and he was
losing weight and nodding out and...
I was pretty sure
he knew I knew,
but I decided one time
to just confront him.
And so I went up
to his bedroom,
and he was sitting
on the side of the bed.
And he was crying because
I had just arrived,
and he knew it was
breaking my heart.
But I...
And I talked to him about it
and everything that I had
learned about heroin.
And I asked him if
he was at the stage
where he was addicted
to also the needle prick.
And he burst into tears.
And he...
he was just ashamed.
One of the songs that actually,
I really liked on In Utero,
but which you took off,
was I Hate Myself and Want to Die.
How literal is that song
in terms of the title?
As literal as a joke can be,
I mean...
Nothing more than a joke.
What kind of... who were you
playing the joke on?
Cos I have to admit,
my first reaction was, you know,
either this is really
intensely satirical
or there's some really
dark shit happening here.
I'm really thankful
for a lot of things.
My family, my child,
and every month, I come to
more optimistic conclusions.
Do you find that you're
getting happier in general?
I hope I don't become
so blissful that I lose...
Become boring?
Yeah, become boring, or I lose my edge,
or whatever it is, you know?
And who knows? I don't have
any new songs right now,
so I'm starting from scratch
for the first time.
Tabula rasa.
Ought to be interesting.
Yeah.
Is there a little fear
of the unknown?
Yeah.
Definitely.
Check, check, check,
check, check, check.
Turn both guitars down now.
They're too loud.
Scott, you know that
goofy ass stuff
that they have at music stores
called Finger Ease?
It's like an anal gel.
If I could just put some
on this string.
Yeah, it's called Finger Ease.
Yeah, it's like a roll-on.
So I just need it on one string.
God, I'm being picky today.
Amy!
Will you guys, like...
Will you and Janet and everybody
that I know sit in the front
so I can look at you?
Cos I hate strangers.
One, two, three.
Thank you.
Any requests?
- Teen Spirit.
- Sliver.
Drain You.
Serve the Servants.
Remember the little black bird
on Davey and Goliath?
The little what?
Black bird on Davey and Goliath
singing Kumbaya.
No, I don't remember
the little bird.
Remember that really evil episode
where he was really mad at this kid
and he had all these visions
of how he was going to...
"First, I'm going to
take him up to a hill
and tie him to a tree
and tar and feather him!"
It was evil.
That wasn't Christian at all!
<i>What else should I be?</i>
<i>All apologies</i>
<i>What else should I say?</i>
<i>Everyone is gay</i>
<i>What else should I write?</i>
<i>I don't have the right</i>
<i>What else should I be?</i>

- What do you want?
- I don't know.
Do you want to go
play someplace?
- Yeah.
- What do you want to do?
I'm gonna play tape recorders.
- Frances?
- Christmas Day, 1993.
Frances Bean Cobain.
I'm thirsty.
Yabba dabba doo!
This is nice!
Johnny Rotten, Leonard Cohen,
Led Zeppelin and the Beatles.
That's you.
Did you say Bob Dylan?
You don't tell stories the way he does,
but... I mean...
You mean, like this?
Every... now and then...
things I know about.
Seen it, done it.
I feel kind of happy right now.
Yeah, I do, too.
We're all sensitive to
ridicule and shame.
But it seemed to me,
having gone through his materials,
that he was hyper-sensitive,
felt criticism, felt praise,
felt things a little more intensely.
Probably.
You know, he was so sensitive
that one time that I thought about
cheating on him, he fucking must...
he must have been
psychic or something.
I thought about it.
I didn't do it, but I thought about it.
You never cheated on Kurt?
No, but I almost did one time,
and he knew it.
And I don't know
how he knew it.
I have no idea how he knew it.
I didn't... the plan didn't
ever go anywhere.
So, it was just...
nothing happened,
but I was tired and I am...
And... I... I'm not...
I wasn't as monogamous
as he is.
I'm a big flirt.
So, I flirt with chairs.
But I never,
never cheated on him.
But I certainly thought about it
one time in London.
And I could've done it.
And the...
the response to it was... um,
he took 67 Rohypnols
and ended up in a coma because
I thought about cheating on him.
I mean, fuck!
You're kidding.
I didn't even make
the phone call to do it.
So why do you think he chose
that night to try to take his life?
Was it because he felt rejected?
I think he would see it more as
like severe betrayal than rejection,
you know what I mean?
