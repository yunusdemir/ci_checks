Let's go, first class!
Get on there!
Move it! Move it! Move it!
Move it! Sergeant,
get your men on there! Let's go!
Is that Peterson's helicopter?
He was in that damn chopper
that blew up.
McCoy! McCoy, get back here!
Where the hell are you goin'?
We're pullin' out.
Captain McCoy!
- Bobby, where's Pete?
- Still in the damn chopper.
The flames are too high.
We tried, but he can't be reached.
Captain, don't go in there!
The fuel bladders are about to blow!
Pete! Pete!
Pete, where are you?
Get the hell out of here, man!
The thing's gonna blow!
Scott?
Goddamn it, get out of here!
This goddamn thing's gonna blow!
Hang on.
Get out!
Hang on, Pete.
Get out of here!
Oh, my God! My leg's gone!
Come on!
Get outta here, Captain!
Listen, Pete. When I raise up the Jeep,
move your leg.
Ready?
Move it!
Move your leg! Pete, move it!
Ah!
Lean on me.
Move, move. Get 'em up here.
Come on, move.
All right, take it up. Let's go.
Colonel, Scott and Pete
are still back there.
They're two men. I got a whole squadron
to think about. Come on. Get it up!
Hey, there they are.
Come on, Scott! Come on!
- Take it down. Take it down!
- You're gonna make it!
- Come on, man!
- Move those on down. Right away!
- Get that ammo secured.
- Come on, man.
Come on! All right, we've got him.
Come on. Here we go. Let's go.
Come on. Make a move. Go.
- Come on. Close the door.
- Give him some room.
- All right.
- Let's go.
Why in the hell
wouldn't they listen, Nick?
We told 'em it's too dangerous
to launch this operation at night.
They thought their plan was better.
I spent five years in Vietnam
watching them doing the planning...
...and us the dying.
Well...
...I'm resigning when I get back.
We interrupt this program to bring
you the following special news bulletin.
We have just received word
that an hour ago,
an attempt to rescue
the American hostages held in Teheran
ended in disaster for the Army's
top-secret antiterrorist special forces.
Eight members of the special unit
have been killed and 13 wounded
according to first count.
No further information as to the cause
of this disaster or its outcome
is available at this time.
American Travelways
flight 282 from Cairo has just landed.
Passengers taking this flight
to New York via Rome
should proceed to gate 11.
Flight 22 now arriving
at gate five.
- Attention please, flight 22...
- I have a bad leg.
I thought you would like to know
we're celebrating
our silver wedding anniversary.
- Congratulations.
- Mazel tov.
Don't congratulate us.
We'd have gotten divorced years ago,
but neither one of us
wanted custody of our kids.
Please don't listen to him.
If it was up to him,
he would spoil 'em rotten.
- Know what? I'm going shopping.
- Good idea.
- I'm gonna see what my daughter's...
- You wanna go to the duty-free?
Let's go. Watch the things, honey.
- Harry Goldman. Philadelphia.
- Ben Kaplan. New York.
Deborah, let her have
the doll she wants. She's a baby.
Mama, she's not a baby,
and you're spoiling her.
I'm not spoiling her.
I didn't do such a bad job with you.
You know, Harry wanted to buy me
a new ring for our anniversary.
I said no.
He got me this ring in Jerusalem
on our honeymoon.
Really? Oh, it's lovely.
What does it say?
One minute. I'll show you.
Here, take it.
It says...
Ah, that's... That's Hebrew.
I know that.
It's from the Song of Songs.
"Me to my lover, my lover to me. "
You're Jewish, huh?
No, I'm Chinese. Of course.
What's the problem?
There's no problem, miss.
We thought you had a water leak.
Can we start boarding now?
Sure. Better check that
with your flight engineer.
Have a nice flight.
I'm sorry, this flight is full.
Please check the ticket counter
for the next available flight.
No, I must be on this flight.
I'm sorry. You have a stand-by ticket.
We're full, sir. Please move aside.
You see in your book.
Maybe there is space.
Sir, you can't go on board this flight.
You can...
You see if there is a place for me.
They told me there is a place.
- Move aside, please.
- No, you move aside!
They told me I got a ticket!
They told me there is a place for me!
Send security immediately.
Calm down. Show me your ticket.
Here. Here. You see?
Stand-by ticket...
Where's my back brace?
Robert has your back brace, Ma.
Thank you.
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.
This is your captain speaking.
My name is Roger Campbell.
On behalf of American Travelways,
I'd like to welcome you aboard
a continuation of flight 282 to Rome,
then onward to New York. Our flight time
to Rome will be 55 minutes.
- Don't be scared to take off.
- Honey, I can't do this.
- Could you pull this for me?
- Yes.
Don't kill me, just pull.
Take a deep breath.
I won't kill you.
- Stop it.
- I'm kidding.
Are you all right, Sister?
- Could I have a glass of water, please?
- Sure.
She's afraid of flying.
Sister wants to get to heaven.
She just doesn't want to fly
to get there.
I'll get you some.
Excuse me. You're from Chicago, no?
Yes. Yes, we are. How did you know?
I am from Chicago myself.
I must have seen you
somewhere in Chicago.
You don't sound like Chicago.
Actually, I've only been
in Chicago four years.
- You're Polish?
- Russian.
Do you know the orthodox church
by Lincoln Park? Father Duchinsky.
I go to hear his sermon every Sunday.
- Are you going back home?
- My first vacation since Russia.
- Enjoyed yourself?
- I feel like I am reborn.
America has been good to us.
Shit.
- Dad, look.
- Let me sleep.
This is a hijack! Heads down!
Heads down!
Everybody down! This is a hand grenade!
We will blow the plane!
What are you doing?
- Get your heads down!
- What are you doing?
- Get down, everybody!
- Put your heads down!
- Heads down!
- This is a hijack!
This is a hand grenade!
We will blow the plane
if you do not do exactly as we say!
Put your hands on your head!
Oh, my God!
No!
Robert, are you all right?
We are prepared to die.
Do not provoke me.
You want to die, you die someplace else.
Mister... Don't. Don't.
Don't. Don't.
- Cockpit. Come.
- We will cooperate.
- Open...
- Calm down. We'll cooperate, man.
- We'll do anything you want.
- Open the cockpit. Open the cockpit.
Open this door.
Jim, it's me. Open.
Open, Jim.
Is everything OK?
Everything is all right. Open, please.
Open this door or I will blow the plane!
Jim, you have to open!
Pick it up.
Move. Sit down.
I am taking over this airplane.
You will cooperate.
We'll take you anywhere
you wanna go, buddy.
Now, why don't you put that pin
back into that hand grenade?
Put it.
Easy, Jim.
I am prepared to die. I am Abdul Rafai.
I am a commander
in the New World Revolution.
You will take orders from me
and from no one but me,
or I will blow this airplane.
Do you hear me?
Loud and clear.
Now, you fly to Beirut.
- Where?
- Beirut. Fly to Beirut.
Beirut.
Roger.
What are you doing?
Take your hand away.
That's normal operating procedure.
Dave, contact Athens
departure control.
No!
You will fly by map.
I know flying. You will fly by map.
I don't think
we have enough fuel, Captain.
Then you will fly
until your fuel runs out, Captain.
That is all.
American Embassy?
This is the Athens airport tower.
Get me the communications officer.
It's urgent.
This is the deputy chief officer
of the American Embassy in Athens.
Get me
the State Department Operations Center.
This is an emergency.
We need immediate access.
I'm reporting a hijack.
The incident occurred five minutes ago
aboard American Travelways flight 282,
en route from Athens
via Rome to New York.
We have no more information at present
as to the status of the situation.
This is the Secretary of State.
I have a priority flash
for the president.
Yes, Mr. Secretary.
I'll put the president on the line.
Good evening.
Or, rather, good morning.
As you know, we have
a major crisis in the Middle East.
The president has decided
to send the Delta Force
into the area immediately.
Now, what we have to do is work out
an emergency rescue operation.
Get me Nick Alexander at Bragg.
Has anybody ever told you
you've got beautiful legs?
Ah, come on, Nick.
You can't see 'em from over there.
Well, I got a good imagination.
I, uh, was just tryin' to be nice.
Anyone ever accuse you
of being a gentleman, Nick?
Not lately.
Grab me the phone,
would you, sweetheart?
Alexander here.
Put Delta Force on a phase three alert.
ATW Flight 282 was just hijacked.
Get Saber Squadron
and fly to the Middle East.
- Lebanon?
- We don't know for sure.
Check in while you're in the air.
Will do, General.
Here you go, sweetheart.
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your new captain speaking.
My name is Abdul Rafai.
I am a member of the New World
Revolutionary Organization.
We have declared war
against the American imperialists,
Zionists, terrorists,
and all other antisocialist atrocities.
Your plane is now headed
for a new destination.
For your safety,
I suggest you listen carefully
and you follow all instructions.
- Harry.
- What?
Harry, my ring. It's Hebrew.
Take it off. Put it in your purse.
Take it off.
Harry, there's a white mark on my hand.
You think they're gonna notice?
Will you marry me?
Oh, Harry.
What's gonna happen to us?
One thing is certain.
We'll always remember
our silver wedding anniversary.
Let's do something.
Yeah, it's only two of 'em.
We can take 'em.
Sh! That's not a good idea.
These guys are dangerous.
Now, they're gonna blow this plane up.
There's a lot of people on this plane,
and we just gotta play their game.
All right.
You can all sit up now!
But nobody talks!
Nobody move!
Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.
- This young lady is preg...
- Shut up!
Please, I'm not feeling well.
An unidentified source
at the State Department
has just confirmed
that an American airliner
en route from Athens
to Rome and New York
has just been hijacked.
Over 100 Americans are believed
to be on board the ATW airliner.
We'll bring you further developments
as they occur.
In the meantime, none of the known
terrorist groups in that region
are willing to take responsibility
for this current action.
Now!
All men sit by the windows.
All women sit near the aisles!
Do it now and quickly!
Just do it!
Fast! Fast! And quiet!
You shut up. Nobody talk.
The hijacked plane
is still in the air
heading for an
unknown destination,
presumably somewhere
in the Middle East.
There is still no word
on the condition of the Americans
and the other hostages on board.
We'll keep you updated
as further information
becomes available.
Everyone get up
and go into the back. Hurry up!
Hurry up!
We're coming. We're coming.
It's all right.
Move! Move!
- Excuse me. I left my purse.
- Leave it! Go!
Come on back. Keep movin'.
Move. Come on, move.
- Come on, move. Keep movin'.
- Sit down!
- I can't sit on the floor.
- Sit!
My back.
Sit! Sit up there. Sit there. Sit.
- I'll sit on his lap.
- Thank you very much. Thank you.
Sit down!
Watch that gun, sir. It might go off.
- What'd you hit him for, man?
- Sit!
Keep quiet. Silence.
There's no space to breathe here.
Shut up! Everyone, shut up!
Sit down!
Ellen! Come back here!
What are you doing here? Go back.
My doll.
It's a nice doll. What is your name?
Ellen.
Ellen. It's a very nice name.
How old are you, Ellen?
Six.
You know, Ellen,
I had a daughter exactly your age.
Her name was Salima.
You understand, Ellen?
Good. Take it.
Thank you.
Go, go. Go!
Come on.
Hey, Ace. You think
the captain's gonna show up?
I'll be damned if he doesn't.
Well, wasn't he called?
Well, who'd call him? He's retired
to that old horse farm of his.
Though, I must admit I wouldn't mind
havin' Captain McCoy along.
I, uh, took the liberty
of giving him a call, sir.
You what?
Well, he wasn't at home.
Then he just might be
on his way here, Colonel.
Nah. None of that.
Now, that looks good.
Oh, yeah.
Pull down the shades.
Pull down the shades.
Put the shades down.
All of you! Shades down.
Pull them down!
All right. Pull them down.
All these window shades, pull them down.
Pull the shades down. Come on.
Pull the shades.
Pull these down.
Come here. Come here!
There are Israelis aboard this airplane.
I want you to identify them for me.
We don't know who the Israelis are.
How could we?
They came off the El Al flight,
and I will find them.
Collect all passports.
- Why?
- Do it!
OK.
Ladies and gentlemen, attention please.
They want all of you to turn
in your passports.
So, please, get out your passports
and hold them over your head.
- Why?
- I don't know why.
Thank you.
Come on.
Just be quiet
and do what they tell you to do.
No, just women!
You go back. Go back! Back!
Miss, did they tell you
why they want our passports?
Do you know why?
Will we get them back?
We need our passports.
Put them here. Here.
All of them. I want all of them.
No cheating. I know
there are 144 passengers.
Ingrid is getting the rest.
Excuse me, miss? Miss?
Miss, we don't have passports.
We're in the Navy.
- We have these green Navy IDs.
- Hide them away.
Hide it, man. Put it away.
Hey, you. Why didn't you
collect these men's passports?
- They don't have passports.
- It's impossible. You are Iying.
No, wait a second. We have these.
We have these.
- What is this?
- It's a Navy ID.
- Marines.
- No, Navy.
We're divers for the American Navy.
- You?
- All three of us. We're all Navy.
Marines. American Marines.
American Marines killed many
of my friends when they bombed Beirut.
America never bombed Beirut.
American planes from your ship
New Jersey bombed our camps.
- Relax.
- Son, you're making a mistake.
America never bombed Beirut.
- Your American ship!
- No!
No!
Stop! He's a priest!
Oh, yes? Three American heroes.
From now on, you travel
only first class, gentlemen.
What's goin' on here?
Shut up.
- Why do you want us...
- Just shut up!
Come here.
Hold this.
Please, just be quiet. OK?
Everything will be all right.
Listen. You don't have to do that.
- We'll cooperate.
- Shut up. Sit down.
Sit down.
Now, you listen to me.
Look at this passport one by one.
Pick out the passport with Jewish names.
American passports
do not state religion.
Give me the Israelis.
There are no Israelis onboard.
Then pick out the Jewish names.
I told you, there is no way
I can know who is a Jew. How can I?
Do it!
I can't! I won't do it!
Yes, you will do it!
No, not me!
Don't you see? I'm German!
What does that mean?
The selections. The Nazis.
The death camps! Don't you see
I can't do what you want me to do?
Very sorry, dear lady.
But... you must do this for us.
You claim you belong
to a revolutionary organization.
That is correct.
We are freedom fighters.
We are fighting for our brothers.
But then you don't want
to be associated with Nazis
who killed six million Jews.
Not enough, lady. Not enough.
The Jews stole Palestine.
They took our lands.
Leave her alone! Without that gun,
you wouldn't be shit!
- Shut up, you American imperialist pig!
- Stop it, please!
- You are all pigs and killers.
- Don't let him kill him!
Don't let him kill him, please.
- Stop him! Don't let him kill him!
- Bitch!
- Pig!
- Please!
You will do what Abdul said.
He is your new captain,
and you obey or you die.
You hear me? You die.
We will kill everyone
on this bloody plane.
No, I won't do it!
Yes!
What's going on, Colonel?
Men and equipment are aboard.
What's the delay?
I'll give him five more minutes.
- Who?
- Oh, nothing, sir.
Just a few more minutes.
Colonel?
Well, it's about time you showed up.
I was afraid
I was gonna have to use this.
What is it?
A presidential decree
ordering you back to duty.
And you can leave the keys
in the van, too.
I've got your gear on the plane.
General, we're all set.
Good luck, Colonel.
- How was your engagement party?
- Well, it was a little cut short.
- Bobby, good to see you.
- Welcome back, boss.
- Do you know who that guy is?
- No.
- Well, let's go do it.
- Let's do it.
- Great to see you.
- Good to see you, Captain Jack.
Remember, I don't want
to carry your ass this time.
- No way, Captain.
- Major.
Yes, sir, Major.
Major.
What the hell, huh?
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your new captain speaking.
Miss Ingrid will read some names.
- If your name is called...
- What are they doing?
...come immediately
to first class cabin.
I repeat, immediately.
Kaplan, Benjamin.
Mr. Benjamin Kaplan.
This can't be happening.
Not now, not again.
Not again.
What are you doing?
Where are you going? Don't go.
We... We survived once.
We can do it again.
I'm coming.
Where are you going?
Go back to your seat.
He is my husband.
Sit down!
No. No. I won't listen.
No, I won't. Go on! Listen!
Why don't you all do something?
There's only two of them!
There's so many of you! Why don't you?
I don't care.
She's just upset.
No, it's the war!
It's the war all over again!
The concentration camps!
Why don't you do something? Something!
- There's only two of them!
- Sit down!
And there's so many of us!
- Do something!
- Please...
You! Sit down! Sit!
I'm Benjamin Kaplan.
What can I do for you?
Sit down.
Next one.
Harry Goldman.
Mr. Harry Goldman,
come to first class, please.
Please. Don't take him, please.
He's a sick man.
He has a heart condition.
- Sylvia. Sylvia, be strong.
- Please no!
Listen to me. Be strong. I'm OK.
- Please don't go!
- I can go. I can go. It's OK.
- It's OK.
- Move.
It's OK.
Go!
- Harry Goldman.
- Sit.
Next.
Robert Levine.
Mr. Robert Levine,
please come to first class, please.
OK, OK. Move, move. Move.
Please don't take my daddy.
Daddy, take me with you!
I have to go, sweetheart.
But I'm not leaving the plane.
- He can't, sweetie. Daddy can't...
- I'm not leaving the plane.
I'll be back.
Daddy. Here, take.
OK, move! Move, move!
Move, move!
Go, go, go, go. Move, move, move!
You just keep your hands
off my daughter.
Move.
On the floor.
David Rosovsky.
Mr. Rosovsky,
come to first class, please.
They're making a mistake.
They're making a mistake.
Mr. Rosovsky, you move
or I shoot you right here.
But I am not Jewish. I'm an American.
I came from Russia,
but now I live in America.
I am Christian Orthodox. Ask them.
Sister, tell him I am not a Jew.
Father, don't you know me from Chicago?
- Move!
- Wait.
Wait. This man is telling the truth.
- He's telling the truth.
- Sit down. We know what we are doing.
Sir, you are making a big mistake...
Sit down. On the floor!
- He is telling the truth.
- Sit down. We know what we are doing.
Father, where are you going?
You, come back!
Come back! I said come back!
No!
Sit down!
- What are you doing here?
- You called me.
- What is your name?
- William O'Malley.
- I did not call you.
- You called for all the Jews.
I'm Jewish, just like Jesus Christ.
You take one of us,
you gotta take us all.
Sit down, then.
- You.
- Me?
Yeah. The pregnant lady. Come on.
Excuse me.
You, go, go, go. Move. Come, come.
I need some pillows.
Give me some pillows.
Come, come, come.
Yeah... Sit down. Sit.
OK, that's enough. Sit.
That's enough. Sit down.
- You feel good? Yes?
- Fine. Thank you for remembering.
- OK everything? Yeah? Good.
- Thank you.
- Sleep well.
- Thanks.
Beirut approach control,
American Travelways flight 282,
under command of Captain Abdul Rafai
of the New...
World Revolution.
...World Revolution
requesting landing instructions.
American Travelway, I am unable
to give you landing instruction.
This airport is closed today
to all international flights
by order of the Lebanese government.
You heard the man.
Now what do you want to do?
Land.
Damn.
Beirut, you must clear that runway
at once, or we'll all die.
You are facing disaster
if you try to land.
Just a minute.
Captain? Captain, this is
the Minister of Defense speaking.
You cannot land in our country.
We have enough trouble
without you people.
We have 144 men, women, and children
aboard this aircraft.
The hijacker has threatened
to blow us up.
But if he does,
it'll be your responsibility.
Do you understand that, Mr. Minister?
Do we now have your permission to land?
My answer is definitely not.
Captain, what's this shouting?
What's going on there?
They're torturing a young boy.
A Navy hostage.
They're killing him.
Mr. Minister,
we're coming in for landing
whether we have your permission or not.
Reducing power.
Captain, it's OK.
You have permission to land.
But just give me a minute.
I want to clear the runway.
All right, gentlemen.
We'll go in three sections.
McCoy, you'll lead the first section.
I want you to hit the emergency exits
on the port wing, here and here,
clearing the first-class cabin
and the cockpit.
Pete, you'll have the second section.
I want you to hit the emergency exits
on the starboard wing, here,
clearing the main cabin.
Bobby, you'll have section three
for backup and emergencies.
Move fast. It should be a piece of cake.
There are only two terrorists onboard.
How do we know that?
A calculated guess.
All right, gentlemen. Any questions?
Please help yourself.
Mama, it's so hot.
I know, sweetie. Everybody's hot.
What are they doing there with Daddy?
Asking him some questions.
What kind of questions?
Maybe, uh... about being Jewish.
They don't like Jews, huh, Mama?
No, sweetie, they don't like Jews.
Open the door. Open the door. Open.
You move, move, move. Sit down.
- Father, God be with you.
- Take care of yourself, Sister.
Take care of them.
You stay.
Ben.
Don't take him, please.
Daddy. Mommy, they're taking Daddy.
No!
Move, move.
All right, time to leave. We take off.
Where to?
I will let you know
when we reach the sky.
We've been informed
by Israeli Intelligence
that they've left Beirut
and are headed towards North Africa.
We have reason to believe
they're on their way to Algiers.
If so, they'll be landing
at Boumediene Airport in four hours.
Nick, I've just had confirmation
from the president.
The Algerian government is ready
to cooperate. You can go to Algiers.
All right, guys. Listen up.
We're landing in Algiers.
Prepare your gear.
Algiers, this is Delta One
requesting permission to land.
Delta One, this is
Boumediene International Airport.
Permission granted.
American Travelways flight 282,
this is Boumediene Algiers Airport.
You are cleared to land.
So you men stay with the equipment.
We are gonna go for it this time,
right, Colonel?
Damn right.
This is Delta One. I receive you.
Delta One, I receive you.
Yes, sir. Just a minute, sir.
Colonel. Colonel,
General Woodbridge, sir.
General Woodbridge, we've got
damn near perfect conditions now.
It's just the situation
we've been waiting for.
If we wait any longer,
we can end up with another fiasco.
I'm sorry, Nick. The president
doesn't want to risk any lives.
If he can release our people
through negotiations,
that's what he wants to do.
So until the negotiations break down...
...your people are on hold.
How long do we have to wait?
Well, General Woodbridge is waiting
for the go-ahead from the president.
I'm waiting for the go-ahead
from General Woodbridge,
and you're waiting
for the go-ahead from me, clear?
In the meantime,
I'm going over to the terminal.
I wanna debrief any hostages
that are released,
if and when any are released.
So you get out there. And get set.
- But wait for my signal.
- Got it.
OK, get rid of the box.
Move out.
Captain Rafai,
the flight from Athens has just landed.
Your comrade will be
with you any moment.
We expect you to release the women
and children without any more delays.
We shall keep our word
as promised, Mr. Ambassador.
All right, Colonel,
I'm gonna go to the plane.
I'll wait for you here, Mr. Ambassador.
You send back any hostage
from that plane that speaks English.
McCoy, nobody moves until all
the women and children are safe.
All sections, acknowledge.
One, two and three.
You wait. You get women and children.
Please, let him go.
He's almost dead.
No.
But you may go.
I release you with the women.
Go.
Ingrid...
You're a brave woman.
Section one in position.
Section two in position.
Section three in position.
We don't move until the women
and children are away and safe.
- Acknowledge, section two.
- Section two acknowledge.
Section three?
Section three acknowledge.
Ladies and children, Allah be praised.
It is time to leave the airplane.
Men will stay in their seats.
We will ask you to have your valuables,
your money, yourjewelry
out in your hands
so that we may collect them
when you come
through the first-class cabin.
Go on, sweetie. You go ahead.
Come on.
We'll see you later.
Jay, you take care of your mom.
You understand me?
You ladies, go forward.
Everyone forward.
- Leave it with you.
- Move forward, Christian ladies.
Why are you behaving
like common bandits?
You're freedom fighters,
aren't you?
Go.
Move.
Go. Go.
I take this... and this...
I have some money.
- This is yours?
- Yes.
Thank you.
- You have some money? OK, go.
- Here.
Go. Go.
Thank God the women are safe.
Yeah.
Nick, the bus has left.
We're ready to make our move.
Sorry, McCoy. We're still on hold.
Damn it, Nick.
Let's not screw this one up.
Everyone to the back!
To the back!
- Colonel Alexander?
- Yeah.
They want you on the phone.
Alexander here.
Nick, it's a go.
Gotcha.
McCoy, it's a go. Take 'em down.
OK, section two and three, let's do it.
Close communications.
We go in... 60 seconds.
Ready? Mark.
Mark. We go in 60 seconds.
Sixty seconds. Mark.
Radios off the air.
Colonel, this is Ingrid Harding,
she's the plane's purser.
Mr. Ambassador, excuse me.
I'd like to talk to her alone.
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.
Miss Harding,
this will only take a few minutes.
What's happening?
The Algerian commandos
are gonna break into the plane.
Oh, no. Don't.
All the hostages in Beirut,
they'll kill them all.
What hostages?
The guys from the Navy
and all the Jews they took off the plane
when the other hijackers came on.
- What other hijackers?
- All those men who came on board.
Ten or 12 of them.
Oh, God. All sections, all sections.
OK, 30 seconds. All right?
All sections!
Come on, somebody respond.
Let's go. Turn the light on.
Hit the siren.
All sections.
What the hell is that?
Come on, get out of there, McCoy.
McCoy!
Turn the lights!
Turn the lights out!
What the hell?
Don't shoot back! We're clearing out!
Get out!
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
Get out. Get out of the tanker.
Oh, shit.
Take off immediately! Take off!
- All right, all right.
- Take off!
Come. Come.
Americans, look what you have done!
Look here, Americans! Look!
He's gonna kill him.
Now your American president
will know we are serious!
- Here is a token for him...
- Don't shoot.
...and the American people.
One Marine killer!
Oh, Jesus.
Son of a bitch. Let's go.
Come on, move.
Sorry I had to do it that way, boys.
It was the only way
I could stop you in time.
What happened, Colonel?
Twelve terrorists got on board.
They were in every corner of that plane
with machine guns.
It would've been a disaster.
He's an American. He was in the Navy.
Where do we go from here?
After them, I hope.
They're going back to Beirut.
You mean it's all over for us?
On the contrary, Colonel.
The president wants you
to fly to Israel.
Israel?
Israel is America's best friend
in the Middle East,
and it's only 20 minutes from Beirut.
You're gonna get anything and everything
you want to do it right.
The president wants those people home.
So do we, General. So do we.
We are Americans. Stay down.
- Clear.
- Clear!
Not bad, McCoy. Not bad.
Twenty seconds. Just like clockwork.
- We can do it in ten.
- All right, one more time.
Hold it, McCoy. We got visitors.
- Colonel Alexander?
- Yeah.
Good morning. I'm Colonel Amir
from the Israeli Intelligence.
Oh, yes. How are you?
This is Major McCoy.
- Good morning, Major.
- Colonel.
- Can I talk to you?
- Well, certainly.
Bobby, take over.
I want it done in ten seconds.
- You got it, sir.
- We'll be right down.
So, what's happening?
They've taken the hostages
off the plane.
- Where to?
- I don't know.
They could be spreading them
all over Beirut by now.
That's bad.
Colonel, I assume your Mossad still has
people planted in Lebanon, right?
Your assumption is correct.
I need to get in contact
with one of them.
You mean you want to get in
and do some reckoning before the rescue?
It'd be a great help to us, Colonel.
If I may suggest...
They've announced
an international press conference.
Of course. Now that they
got the world's attention,
they wanna manipulate
the press. Perfect.
I was in Beirut 20 years ago.
You should have been here then.
It was something.
They had everything:
nightclubs, dancing, concerts, laughter.
It was the Las Vegas of the Middle East.
Beirut was beautiful then. Beautiful.
Hey, Marine heroes.
Your friend.
He made the news.
They killed him. They killed Tom.
How have they been treating you,
Captain?
- Sh!
- Quite well.
They're feeding us.
They're letting us use the rest rooms.
I suppose, under the circumstances,
they're treating us quite well.
Where are the others?
Where do they keep the Jews?
It's true about the selection?
Go back!
One more question!
If you try to be clever with me,
Captain, I will kill you.
That'd make you a real hero,
wouldn't it?
Yes, yes.
Now, you go back to the press,
but you watch what you say, huh?
Now, ask your questions, please.
One at a time.
Belt.
Where'd you get the stupid belt?
You gave it to me for my birthday.
I did? I hope you like it.
So you're Canadian.
You're blessed
with a beautiful and peaceful country.
I'd like to go there myself one day.
Well, it's a beautiful country here.
It's a shame.
Do you know where we need to go?
Yes, my son. We're on our way.
You'll need these.
If you look down to your right,
you'll see the main sewer pipe.
It will lead you directly
to the backyard of the school.
That is where most of the hostages are.
Their headquarters. The Jews are there.
Do you want to come with me?
No, go and do what you have to do.
Under the seat you'll find something
you might need... just in case.
Don't take too long.
Boss, aren't we trusting this guy
a bit too much?
The Israelis say
he's the best man they have in Lebanon.
And we need someone
to get the message back to Nick.
Boss. Boss, look.
We'd better get outta here.
Wait.
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go!
Jesus Christ, what do we do now?
Get the hell outta here.
Shit.
You OK, Butch?
Yeah, I'm OK, boss.
Shit, that was a close one, huh?
It's already 4:15.
We had him on the radio.
He started to say something.
Then we lost him.
Well, I can't wait any longer.
This is Mr. Samir,
your guide in Beirut.
Oh, good. We gotta get moving.
Otherwise, we're gonna miss
that rendez-vous.
Uh, Raffi, I just want to thank
you for all your help on this.
I wish I could join you.
Well, you boys have done it before.
Now it's our turn.
Good luck.
All right, check your gear, boys:
all the vehicles, weaponry, personal.
Let's go.
Aw, Jesus, boss. She's had it.
We need another vehicle here.
We've got one.
Here are some blankets for the night.
How about some beds?
You don't need beds.
You're gonna die tomorrow.
Scott, that must be them.
About a mile offshore, I'd say.
- You OK?
- Yeah. You?
Yeah, good to be on dry land.
How we doing?
Well, we have three targets.
A school in the northern part
of Beirut beach. 60 hostages are there.
Do you know where that is?
Is it the one
by the Greek Orthodox cemetery?
- Yeah, right.
- I got it.
And the Jews are being held
in a dungeon at their headquarters.
It's in the center of town.
You know where it's at, right?
- Yes, sir.
- Good.
And the ATW crew
is still being held on the plane.
We'll have to get them last.
Right. And I drew a map here.
All right, everybody.
Get your badges on.
We move out in two minutes.
Let's go right, partner.
That's the place.
Good luck.
Why do you look at me like that?
You hate me, huh?
It's your government we fight, not you.
It's your White House.
One day I will go there.
I will drive a truck,
and truck, it will blow.
That'll be suicide. You know that.
I know how to die.
The White House is a very big place.
You'll need a lot of explosives.
You'll never get near the place.
Don't kid yourself.
Do you think we don't have
friends in America?
You will be surprised.
One day. One day.
Delta Two in position.
Ready, boss?
Let's do it.
Cover us.
One minute to showtime.
Get ready.
OK, 30 seconds to blastoff.
Come on, McCoy.
Sleep tight, sucker.
Backyard, Bobby.
Nick's waiting with the truck.
Right, boss. Gentlemen, let's go.
Segal, take the rear.
Stop him!
- Hey.
- Ah!
American?
American, do you hear me?
I want to talk to you.
American? I want to negotiate.
Do you hear me, American?
Loud and clear.
Come on, hurry.
Get back!
My leg!
All right, get down!
Here I come. Hold on to me.
Hold on. I got you.
- Let me help. I'm a medical student.
- All right.
He'll need help with circulation.
McCoy, what are you doing up there?
Drop that thing and get down here quick.
What do you want me to do? Jump?
I don't care what you do. Make it fast.
- Fast enough?
- Where are the hostages?
They must be delayed in the shelter.
Bobby's with them.
This'll hold you
till we get you to a hospital.
Not a local hospital, I hope.
Hey, am I gonna lose the leg?
Don't worry. You'll be jogging
by next week. Let's go.
Let me carry him. You've enough to do.
Thank you. Gentlemen,
follow me quickly.
Better hurry. I think there's
heavy reinforcements are on the way.
- How do you know?
- Something I heard on the radio.
I didn't know you spoke Arabic.
If we don't get outta here,
we'll all be speaking it.
Bobby! Come on.
- Watch his leg.
- Let's just go. Come on.
Come on, keep it moving.
Keep it moving. Let's go.
Come on, men, we gotta go.
Let's go, come on.
Hit it. Move it, move it. Go!
Goddamn place is empty.
Looks like they've been here.
Come on. Let's go.
- Delta One.
- Delta Two here.
Colonel, by the looks of it,
their headquarters is empty.
The cells are,
I repeat, the cells are empty.
Looks like they've taken
our people away.
Then find 'em, damn it.
Any suggestions, Delta One?
Beggin' the Colonel's pardon,
but Beirut's a goddamn big city.
There's over two million people here.
You know what to do, Pete.
Find one that speaks English
and work on him.
Come on, boys! You gotta move fast!
Gotta find one who'll talk.
- Where'd you find 'em all?
- Hiding in the bedrooms upstairs.
Yeah?
Now, who is your commanding officer?
Speak or you're dead.
Officer. You? You? Officer?
Come here. Get up.
Open your mouth.
Open your mouth. Mouth.
Ah, ah!
- Ah, ah, ah.
- Nod if you wanna live.
Do you wanna live? Live?
- Where did they take the Americans?
- Ah, ah...
Where did they take the Americans?
First and ten, Delta One.
They're on their way to Teheran.
They should be somewhere
on the Damascus road right now.
- Go after them.
- Yes, sir. I'll see you when I see you.
OK, let's move!
Damn. It's gonna be light soon.
Take off, Nick.
I'll delay the reinforcements.
OK. Then you join Pete.
I'll see you at the airport.
I won't be able to wait for you.
- Then don't wait.
- I won't.
OK, Bobby, you stick with the major.
Then take my vehicle
and meet us back at the orchard.
- Will do.
- All right, let's go. Come on.
Delta Two, this is Delta One. Over.
- What's the plan, boss?
- A surprise party.
- Just like the old days.
- You got it.
Delta Two, Delta One. Come in.
I'm gonna prepare the upper floors.
Yeah, I'm here, Major.
How's it goin', kid?
Well, those bastards snaked us, boss.
I'm gonna go get 'em.
Watch your ass, Butch, OK?
Yeah, I'll see you when I see you, boss.
- Bobby.
- Yo.
- It's showtime.
- Let's rock 'n' roll.
Goddamn. That's Scott down there.
All right, let's rock 'n' roll, partner.
OK, let's move! Let's go!
Let's take 'em.
They're our guys. They're Americans.
They're Delta Force.
Need a hand?
Grab the wheel!
Cover us.
Pete. Pete.
Gimme that blanket.
Pete.
- Take off his clothes.
- Pete.
Jesus... Pete.
- You know the way to the airport?
- Yes, Major.
Get the hostages out of the truck
and put them in our vehicles.
The Colonel will be waiting for you
at an orange grove behind the airport.
- Don't stop for anything, understand?
- Yes, sir.
I'll take your bike.
- What about you, Major?
- I've got some business to finish.
Tell the colonel not to wait for me.
I need more bandages.
There's too much blood.
Going somewhere?
Pete.
Hey, doc. Get on Pete here.
Keep it quiet.
Mike, bring my bag.
And the oxygen, too.
- Looks like they're expecting us.
- Yes, sir.
We're gonna have to find another way.
Maybe we could cut
through the back fence.
Yeah.
Looks quiet.
How many guards around the plane
do you figure?
I'd say between 12 and 16.
Six of our men.
- Oh!
- Ah!
Ah!
- Do you speak English?
- Yeah.
You wanna live, talk fast.
Who's in charge here?
Jaaffer. He is in the plane.
- How many men does he have?
- Nobody.
- Come on.
- I swear by Allah he is alone.
What about the hostages?
There are only three,
sleeping in the cockpit.
Do you have a password?
If you wanna live, then use it.
- Maybe he is asleep.
- Wake him up.
Jaaffer Iben Khalil.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Colonel Alexander. Delta Force.
- It's about time.
- Got enough fuel?
- For what?
- To fly to Israel.
You bet.
Need anything else
to get this thing off the ground?
Yeah. A clear runway.
OK. All right, Jim, bring 'em in.
Bring 'em in.
- Come on, gang.
- Let's get our butt moving.
Let's go!
Sit down in the rear and buckle up.
We gotta get out of here fast.
Come on, move, move, move.
Everybody find a seat fast!
Put him in first class.
Keep moving. If they're not wounded,
move to the back of the plane.
Put him over there. Come on.
Get 'em down there. Keep going.
Come on.
Are you all right? Get in the back.
You, too.
Come on. Double time.
Let's go! Come on!
Pull it!
Where is that McCoy?
- Intercom check.
- Check.
All right, Captain.
Everybody's onboard.
Let's wind this son of a bitch up
and get outta here
before the whole of Beirut shows up.
You got it.
OK. High-pressure start... number two.
Come on. Let's go. Close that hatch.
- Colonel, what about Major McCoy?
- We can't wait. He's always late.
I gotta get these people outta here.
Come on, move!
OK, gang, let's go.
Flight 282. Flight 282,
what are you doing?
You have no authorization to move.
Stay where you are.
Beirut, this is
American Travelways flight 282.
I wanna thank you
for an interesting stay in Beirut.
Hope you all have a nice day.
ATW 282, out.
Hell, they're shooting at us.
Colonel, it's the major!
Well, come on. Get a rope down to him.
Ready? OK.
That's it. We got you.
Don't worry. Pull, pull!
Steward, close the door.
Let's go. Goose this bird
and let's get outta here.
I don't know that we have enough room.
We won't have a second chance.
Give it all you got.
All right. Here we go.
How's Pete?
He's up front.
Doc set up a hospital
in the first-class section.
Hey, guys, Budweisers.
Let's pass 'em over.
Pass 'em over. There's lots more
where these came from.
How is he, doc?
Boss.
Hi, kid.
Did we get 'em all out?
Yeah, we got 'em all.
Are we goin' home now?
We're goin' home.
Well, I'll see you there, Scott.
See you when I see you.
Doc...
Greater love no man hath
than he gives up his life for a friend.
Heavenly Father,
we humbly ask you
that you cherish
this most loving soul
in the palm of your hand
for all eternity.
In the name of the Father and the Son
and the Holy Ghost.
Amen.
Oh, my God.
I'll be OK. You all right? You safe?
How are you?
Don't give up on this airplane.
