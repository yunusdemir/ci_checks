Betty?
Miss williams.
Mrs. Griggs, Reverend Parris asks
that the doctor come at once.
- Betty's gone sick. She can't wake.
- can't she?
The doctor's gone to the Putnam's.
Their Ruth can't wake either.
l fear there be no medicines for this.
l have seen nothing like it before.
There be no fever...
...nor wound...
...and yet she sleeps.
oh, dear Lord.
My Betty is the same.
- The same?
- only, her eyes are closed.
lt's the devil, isn't it?
The devil is taking hold of them.
oh, Goody Putnam- -
Doctor, l beg you. She is my last, my only.
l cannot lose her.
l shall do all l can, Goody Putnam.
But this may be a sickness
beyond my art.
Thomas!
l beg you, we cannot leap to witchcraft
for the cause of this.
Don't you understand it, sir?
There are hurtful, vengeful spirits
laying hands on these children.
Let you take hold here.
Let no one charge you.
Declare it yourself.
Not yet. l need time.
l must think. l must pray.
Yes, l agree with Reverend Parris.
Good day to you, sir.
She still sleeps, then, doctor?
- She flies, you know.
- Flies? come now, man.
- George collins has seen her.
- Seen what?
The minister's daughter
going over lngersoll's barn.
- Uncle, perhaps you should go tell them- -
- what should l tell them?
That my daughter and my niece...
...were discovered dancing like heathen
in the forest?
we did dance...
...and let me be whipped if l must be,
but they are talking of witchcraft.
Betty's not witched!
were you conjuring spirits
in the forest?
- l want the truth now.
- we never conjured spirits.
Now, hear me, child.
You must know that there is a faction in this
church sworn to drive me from my pulpit.
l know.
And they will destroy me now
if my own house...
...turns out to be the center
of some obscene practice.
Now, l saw someone naked
running through the trees.
- No one was- -
- Don't lie to me! l saw it!
- lt were only sport, uncle.
- You call this sport? She cannot wake!
Give me upright answer, now.
Your name in the town is entirely
white, is it not?
There be no blush about my name, sir.
why did Goody Proctor discharge you
from her service?
Because l refused to be her slave.
l have heard said that John Proctor....
John Proctor and you- -
My name is good in the village! Elizabeth
Proctor's an envious, gossiping liar!
Mr. Parris, they're asking for you.
You must come down, sir.
Betty, my sweet, wake up.
wake up, Betty.
Betty! Now, stop this!
l know you hear me. wake up now!
Betty!
John!
Giles and Martha are here.
All right.
Boys.
You've got to come with me
to the village, John.
Mr. Parris, God help us, has summoned
a meeting of the society.
what for?
what for? why has that man ever called
a meeting except for his own benefit?
- l'm explaining it.
- Sorry not to have noticed.
They're saying his daughter, Betty,
has been witched.
She sleeps and can't be waked.
And the Putnam girl too, they say.
- what do you know of this, Mary warren?
- Nothing.
l smell mischief here.
You must come with me, John.
They will look to your judgment.
- How can they not wake up?
- God knows.
You go right ahead, l'll be along.
- l'll see you soon, Elizabeth.
- Goodbye, Martha.
There are still flowers in the field.
You might cut some.
- lt's winter in here yet.
- Aye, l'll cut some flowers.
Give a penny. Give a penny.
Annoy the devil.
Goody osborne, you have
no permission to beg here.
- l'll wait for you. l fear this.
- Fear it? why?
Let us quiet our hearts.
You are all aware of the rumors...
...of that spirit come among us
out of hell.
That hateful enemy of God
and all christian people, the devil.
l have invited the Reverend John Hale
of Beverly to come to Salem.
He has delved deeply...
...into all demonic arts and will
surely go to the bottom of this.
You may recall in Beverly last year
they believed they had a witch...
...until Mr. Hale examined her...
...and decided she was
innocent to witchcraft.
But it may well be that in Salem
he will find signs of Lucifer...
...and if so, you may be sure...
...he will hunt him down.
Let us turn our hearts...
...to Psalm 73...
...''Sure God ls Good To lsrael.''
Sure God is good to Israel
You will stop this now! Betty!
- what'll we do? They're talking witchcraft!
- She means to tell.
we've got to tell
or they'll be calling us witches.
witchery's a hanging error.
Like they done in Boston two year ago.
You'll only be whipped for trying
to conjure the boys and the dancing.
Now, listen to me, Betty, dear.
l've talked to your papa
and l've told him everything.
So there's nothing to
be feared anymore.
l want my mama.
Your mama's dead and buried!
l'll fly to her!
- Let me fly!
- Stop it!
- Betty, come here!
- Mama! Mama! No! Mama!
why are you doing this?
l've told him. He knows now.
You drank blood, Abby!
You didn't tell him that!
You never say that again!
You drank a charm
to kill John Proctor's wife!
- No, Abby.
- You drank a charm to kill Goody Proctor!
Now, shut it!
- She's going to die!
- Now, look, you!
All of you.
we danced. That is all.
And mark this...
...let anyone breathe a word...
...or the edge of a word
about the other things...
...and l will come to you...
...in the black of the night and
l'll bring a pointy reckoning...
...that will shutter you.
And you know l can do it.
l saw lndians smash my parents' head
on the pillow next to mine...
...and l have seen some
reddish work done at night.
And l can make you wish you
never saw the sun go down.
- Mama!
- No, Betty!
- Mama! Mama!
- Keep still, you little devil!
- Betty!
- The devil is here!
when she heard the psalm,
she ran straight for the window.
Mark it for a sign, Mr. Parris.
My mother told me that.
There is hard sickness here,
Giles corey, so please to keep the quiet.
l've not said a word.
Nobody can testify l've said a word.
Rebecca, l fear we're lost.
She cannot bear
to hear the Lord's name!
That's a notorious sign of
witchcraft afoot, Rebecca.
what have you done?
Goody Nurse, will you go to our
Ruth and see if you can wake her?
l think she'll wake
when she tires of it.
l am 26 times a grandma.
They can run you bowlegged
in their silly seasons.
So you've sent for
Reverend Hale of Beverly?
only to satisfy all that
the devil's not among us.
- Mr. Proctor.
- John, come help us.
we are all at sea.
why not meet before
you decided to look for devils?
A man cannot pick his teeth without
some sort of meeting in this society.
Society will not be a bag
to swing around your head.
Mr. Proctor, you must know by now that
the better half of Salem village- -
Dear friends.
Mr. Parris, l think you'd best send
Reverend Hale back as soon as he come.
This will set us all to arguing again
in the society.
Let us rather blame
ourselves than the devil.
Blame ourselves?
How can we blame ourselves?
l'm one of nine sons.
The Putnams have peopled this province.
And we have but one child left of eight.
Goody Ann, we can only go
to God for the cause of that.
God?! You think it be God's work...
...that you have never lost a child
or grandchild and l bury all but one?
who or what lets us decide what is God's
work, Goody Putnam, and what is not?
God never spoke in my ear. l can't think
of anyone else he done the favor.
Your pardon, Rebecca.
ls this your mischief?
l hear the child goes
flying through the air.
oh, she never flew.
we were dancing in the woods. My uncle
leaped in on us. She took fright, is all.
You'll be clapped in the stocks
before you're 20.
oh, John, give me a soft word.
- No, Abby, that's done with.
- l am waiting for you every night.
You cannot. l never gave you hope
to wait for me.
l have something better
than hope, l think.
child.
- How do you call me child?
- wipe it out of mind, you must.
l'll not be coming for you more.
You're surely sporting with me.
You know me better.
l know how you sweated like a stallion
whenever l'd come near you.
l saw your face when she put me out.
You loved me then...
...and you do now.
Abby, l may think of you softly
from time to time.
But l will cut off my hand
before l reach for you again.
we never touched.
Aye.
But we did.
l marvel how a strong man may let
such a sickly wife- -
- Speak nothing of Elizabeth.
- She is blackening my name in the village!
Telling lies about me!
- She's a cold woman and you bend to her!
- Do you look for whipping?
l look for John Proctor,
who put knowledge in my heart.
l never knew what pretense Salem was.
christian women and
their covenanted men!
And all of them boiling in lust!
And now you bid me go dead
to all you taught me?
l know you, John Proctor!
You loved me.
whatever sin it is, you love me yet!
Dr. Hale.
How can the devil be here?
we love God.
- lt's Mr. Hale, John.
- l know who it is. can l help you?
l thank you.
Heavy books.
well, they must be.
They're weighted with authority.
l'm John Proctor, Mr. Hale.
You have afflicted children?
My children's healthy
as bull calves, sir.
Like all the other children in this village.
where is my wood? My contract provides
l be supplied with all of my firewood.
There are wheels
within wheels here, Mr. Hale.
- l hope you'll not forget that.
- That 6 pound is part of my salary!
Salary's 60 pound....
- l am a graduate of Harvard college.
- l am well- instructed in arithmetic!
l cannot fathom you people!
l can never offer one proposition
but l face a howling riot of argument!
l've wondered if the devil
be in it somewhere.
welcome to Salem.
Mr. Hale!
Good to see you.
well, l see you've come well- prepared.
- This is Thomas Putnam.
- How do you do?
Allow me, sir.
This is my wife, Goody Ann.
will you come to our Ruth? Her soul
seems flown away. will you come to her?
Aye, l'll come directly.
And you must be Rebecca Nurse.
And Mr. Nurse?
You know me?
No, but you look as such
a good soul should.
All of us in Beverly have heard
of your great charities.
There is prodigious danger
in seeking loose spirits.
l fear it.
- Francis.
- Mr. Hale.
l go to God for you, sir.
l hope you do not mean
that we go to Satan here.
l wish l knew.
l hear you be a sensible man,
Mr. Hale.
l hope you'll leave some of it
in Salem.
our child cannot wake, sir.
She lies as though dead.
And this one cannot bear the Lord's name.
lt's a sure sign of witchcraft.
No, no, Mr. Putnam. we must not
look to superstition in this.
The marks of the devil
are as definite as stone.
what book is that?
what's there, sir?
Here is all the invisible world.
ln these books the devil stands
stripped of all his brute disguises.
Here are all your familiar spirits,
your incubi and succubi.
Your witches that go by land,
by air and by sea.
Have no fear now.
we shall find him out
if he's among us.
And l mean to crush him utterly
if he has shown his face.
Here is my niece, Abigail.
l'd like to examine your Ruth
before l say more.
Mr. Hale, l've always wanted
to ask a learned man...
...what signifies the reading
of strange books?
Many a night l've found her in a corner
reading of a book. Not the Bible, either.
- who?
- Martha, my wife.
l'm not saying the devil's
touched her, but mark this:
Last night l tried and tried
but could not say my prayers.
Then she closed her book
and walked out of the house.
And suddenly, mark this,
l could pray again.
The stoppage of prayer.
we'll discuss that.
Mr. Hale, this way.
was there no warning
of this affliction?
Do you recall any disturbance
before it struck?
Any unusual behavior?
Mr. Hale.
Mr. Parris.
l did discover my niece...
...with a number of her friends,
dancing in the forest.
- You permit dancing?
- No, no. lt was secret.
- Mr. Parris' slave has knowledge of conjuring.
- Now, that may not be true.
Abigail, you must tell
me about this dancing.
- common dancing is all it is, sir.
- when you are dancing, is there a fire?
why?
There was a fire.
They were boiling something.
- Lentils and beans!
- was anything moving?
- That jumped in. we never put that in.
- what jumped in?
l must see these other girls.
who are they? l want their names.
Someone called the devil
in that forest.
who was it led you
to dance around the fire?
You can save yourselves
if you tell me who it was.
was there one among you
who drank from the kettle?
was there perhaps a casting of spells?
was there?!
Not l! lt wasn't me, l swear it!
These two children may be dying! who?!
- Tituba.
- l knew it!
- Tituba!
- come out now!
She made me do it!
She made Betty do it!
- Tituba no do bad thing!
- She made me drink blood!
- You drank blood?
- My baby's blood!
who murdered my babies?
l want their names! who are they?!
why can the girls not wake? Did you
send your spirit out to silence them?
l love me Betty.
- Hang that bitch!
- No! Not Tituba!
You've conjured her to be silent,
have you not?
She beg me conjure.
She begged me make charm.
She lies!
She sends her spirit into me in church!
She makes me laugh at prayer!
- She's often laughed at prayer.
- She comes into me when l sleep.
- She makes me dream corruptions!
- why you say bad thing, Abby?
Some nights l wake...
...and l find myself...
...standing naked in the open doorway
without a stitch on my body!
And she makes me do that...
...singing her damn Barbados songs,
tempting me!
Tituba, when did you compact
with the devil? Tell me!
l don't. l don't compact
with the devil.
Tell or l will beat you
to your death!
l tell! l tell him!
l tell him. l tell him.
l don't desire- -
l don't desire to work for him.
Then you saw him.
You poor woman.
He has you by the throat
this very moment, doesn't he?
Tituba, l'm going to break his
grip on both of you.
l'm going to pry open
the hands of Lucifer.
- You would be a good christian once again?
- Aye, sir, a good christian.
You love God?
- l love him with all my being.
- ln God's holy name...
- ...and to his glory...
- To his glory.
...open yourself, receive his cleansing light
within you. You want that?
- l want that light. Save me, Mr. Hale.
- l will, if you open your heart to me.
when the devil comes to you,
does he bring other people?
- Sarah Good? Does he bring Goody Good?
- Are they men or women?
- l couldn't see, it was dark!
- You saw him, why not others?
They was talking
and running around!
- Are they Salem witches?
- l believe so. Yes, sir!
l will protect you.
- The devil can never overcome a minister.
- l know that, sir.
Tituba, God put you in our hands
to help cleanse this village.
You are God's eyes.
Now, face God and speak utterly.
who came to you with the devil?
Two? Three? Four?
- was Sarah Good with him, or osborne?
- Their names, their names!
- How many times he bid me kill you!
- Kill me?
''Rise up, Tituba, and cut that man's throat!''
That's what him tell me.
l said, ''No, devil.
l don't hate that man.''
Him say, ''Tituba, you work for me.
l make you free.
l give you pretty dress to wear...
...and l put you way up
high in the air...
...and you going flying back
home to Barbados.''
And l say, ''No, devil, you lie!''
And then...
...him come to me...
...one stormy night and him say,
''Tituba, look!
l has white people belong to me.''
And l look.
l look.
And there was Sarah Good!
l knew it! Bless you, Tituba!
- Aye! And Goody osborne!
- l knew it!
They were midwives to me three times
and my babies shriveled in their hands!
l want to open myself!
l want the light of God!
l want the sweet love of Jesus!
l did dance for the devil!
l saw him! l wrote in his book!
l go back to Jesus! l kiss his hand!
l saw Sarah Good with the devil!
l saw Goody osborne with the devil!
l saw Bridget Bishop with the devil!
- l saw Goody Howe with the devil!
- She speaks!
l saw Goody Good!
l saw Goody osborne!
l saw Goody Barrow with the devil!
Hallelujah!
Glory be to God!
lt is broken, they are free!
where's the marshal?
Arrest Sarah osborne!
Sarah Good in a jail.
would you believe a court would ever
bother to jail that silly old turtle?
John! Giles! News from the village.
There were six more accused today.
- More mischief here, Giles.
- The town's gone wild, l think.
They've sent to Boston for the deputy
governor to come and take charge.
That's Danforth. He'll bring
some sense to it. That's good news.
Judge Hathorne condemned 1 4 more
to the jail last night.
And promised hanging
if they don't confess.
- confess? To what?
- Bewitching the children.
Abigail williams suffers
most of all, he says.
Save my cider.
l'll go home now and tell Martha.
l'm thinking if the crop comes good...
...l'll buy Joseph ward's heifer.
- How would that please you?
- Aye, it would.
l mean to please you, Elizabeth.
lt would be well if you went to Salem.
Abigail told you it had naught to do
with witchcraft, did she not?
They say Ezekiel cheever's clerk
of the court now. can you not tell him?
God forbid you keep that
from the court, John.
- A wonder they do believe her.
- But they do.
Mary warren...
...says that where Abigail walks
the crowds part like the sea for lsrael.
l think you must go at once.
l would go tonight, John.
- will you?
- l will think on it.
- You cannot keep it.
- l say l will think on it.
How will l prove
what she told me, Elizabeth?
we were alone together.
l've no proof of what she said.
You were alone with her?
For a moment, alone, aye.
Then it is not as you told me.
A moment. There were others close by.
- Do as you wish, then.
- l'll not have your suspicion anymore.
No, John, if it were not Abigail that you
must go to hurt, would you falter now?
- l think not.
- You'll not judge me more. l forgot Abigail.
- And l.
- Spare me. You forget and forgive nothing.
ln this seven months since she has gone,
l've not moved without l think to please you.
But a funeral still marches
around your heart.
You're not open with me.
You saw her with a crowd, you said- -
l'll plead my honesty no more.
No more!
l should've roared you down
when first you told me your suspicion...
...but like a christian, l confessed.
But you're not God, Elizabeth!
Let you look for some goodness in me.
And judge me not.
The magistrate sits in your heart
that judges you.
l never thought you but a good man, John.
only somewhat bewildered.
oh, Elizabeth.
Your justice would freeze beer.
- Judge Hathorne.
- Judge Danforth.
- Judge Sewall.
- Sir.
- Mr. Parris.
- Your Honor.
- Mr. Hale.
- Judge.
The selectmen.
Thomas Putnam.
The afflicted girls, sir.
l assure you, gentlemen...
...that His Majesty's Government
is now determined...
...that the devil shall not rule over
one single inch of Massachusetts!
And if indeed he has come...
...here in Salem is where
we shall dig him out.
Provided every precaution be taken...
...to guard against the testimony
of distracted persons...
...and, of course, the mad.
lndeed, Judge Sewall.
Bring in Sarah Osborne!
Now, Sarah osborne,
here is Sarah Good...
...who has confessed to witchcraft
and will not hang.
l bid you follow her example.
She testifies that when the devil
came to her, you were in his company.
There they stood, big as life.
Him and her.
And osborne writing her name in his
book with her own red blood!
Your Honors, l never
see the devil in my life.
But l can dance as fast backwards...
...as he can forward!
Sit down, l tell you!
- Sit her down!
- Let go of me!
You must stop your funning.
You must give up your stories!
You bring me to harm!
Do you hear me? You bring me to harm!
Stop hurting me, Goody osborne!
Help me, Judge Danforth!
- what are you doing to these girls?
- what do you mumble to make them so sick?
l was only saying my commandments.
l hope l may say my commandments!
Let her recite her commandments.
Your Grace, l may only
say my commandments outdoor.
There are 1 0 commandments.
Do you know any?
Help me!
You have lied to the court.
l say, you have lied to the court.
Have you not?
l'm innocent to witch.
The devil knows that!
''Then Nebuchadnezzar the king
was astonished...
...and rose up in haste
and spake and...
...said unto his counselors:
'Did not we cast three men bound
into the midst of the fire?'''
She's been to the court.
Get out of my garden, you filthy beast!
whose goat is this?
Take your hands off my goat!
And curb your wicked tongue!
Take your goat and get out!
The devil take you all!
All of you be damned!
You are arrested
on suspicion of witchcraft.
Any compact you have made
with the devil....
This man is full of spite!
l am no witch!
His goats were eating my food!
These girls are mad!
l warned you once before, Proctor.
That's my lumber. You're in my bounds!
My land's always run up
through the forest and l haven't sold any.
lt is clear in my grandfather's will.
Your grandfather damn near
willed away my north pasture!
But he knew l'd bite his arm
if he tried it.
Good morning!
Morning, Mr. Putnam.
order!
Now, Ruth Putnam, when did you
last see Mr. Jacobs?
He come to me two night past
when l was abed.
But, Ruth, you are mistaken.
You know me.
l am Mr. Jacobs, your neighbor.
l have 600 acres next to theirs.
She has known me all her life.
He come through my window.
Then he lay down upon me.
l could not take breath.
His body crush heavy upon me.
And he say in my ear:
''Ruth Putnam, l will have your life
if you testify against me in court.''
what say you to this charge, Mr. Jacobs?
But, Your Honor...
...l must have these sticks to walk with.
How may l come through a window?
But you could have sent out your spirit
through a window, could you not?
But how may my spirit go out of my body?
There's a black man whispering
at his shoulder.
Ruth Putnam has informed me...
...that there is a black man whispering
in your ear at this very instant.
He's there!
He's whispering, l see him!
- l see him. l see him.
- Do you see him?
A black man!
The devil is here!
- How dare you mock them, Martha corey?
- what else are fools good for?
How do you dare go to Salem again,
when l forbade you?
No! Don't hurt me!
l am sick, pray, hurt me not!
Get in the house! Go on!
l made a gift for you today,
Goody Proctor.
Thank you. lt is a fair poppet.
we must all love each other now.
Go on in.
what ails you, child?
oh, Mr. Jacobs will hang!
- Hang?
- Aye.
And Goody osborne too.
- The deputy governor will permit it?
- He must.
But not Sarah Good.
She will only sit in jail some time,
for Sarah Good confessed, you see.
l am amazed you do not see
the weighty work we do.
The devil is loose in Salem, Mr. Proctor.
we must discover where he's hiding.
So l'll be gone every day for some time.
- l am an official of the court now.
- l'll thrash the devil out of you!
l saved her life tonight!
l am accused?
You were somewhat mentioned.
But l told the court...
...l never seen no sign you ever
sent your spirit out to hurt no one...
- ...and they dismissed it.
- who accused me?
l am bound by law. l cannot tell.
Go to bed, Mary.
l'll not be ordered
to bed no more, Mr. Proctor.
l am 1 8 and a woman,
however single.
Do you wish to sit up?
Then sit up.
l wish to go to bed.
Good night, then.
Good night.
The noose is up.
There'll be no noose.
Abigail wants me dead, John.
You know it.
Thank you, my dear.
God bless you, child.
l come to tell you to think
on what to do to save yourself.
You'll say you cannot see spirits anymore.
And you will never cry witchery again.
l know you must speak so, John.
l understand.
But my spirit's changed entirely.
l suffer now.
lt's the truth, John! Look!
The bite your wife gave me
is not yet healed.
- My wife?
- Saturday...
...she come to my bed in the night
and bite my breast.
My wife has not left the house this month.
why must she leave the house
to send her spirit on me?
Don't George Jacobs come jabbing at me
with his walking sticks?
Feel the lumps he give me only last night.
George Jacobs is locked up in the jail.
And thank God he is!
They'll hang him.
- And he prays! He prays in jail!
- May he not pray?
And torture me at night
while he's praying! Hypocrite!
They all are. Thank God l have the power
to cleanse the town of them!
Hear me.
lf ever you cry witch against my wife,
it will be the end of you.
l will not have her condemned.
l am but God's finger, John.
lf he would condemn Elizabeth,
she will be condemned.
You know me.
lf she is condemned,
it will be the end of you.
Samuel, l believe you are sometimes
not entirely content with us.
Am l correct?
l must tell you, Thomas.
l had not expected so much of our evidence
to come from children.
- Had you?
- l had not.
But you cannot doubt
the children are painfully attacked.
No, l see that plainly.
Recall the Gospel, Samuel:
''From the mouths of babes shall
come the truth.''
But it is also this Putnam woman.
l wonder if losing her children
has not distracted her mind.
And Mr. Putnam is in constant disputation
with his neighbors over his boundaries.
Some tell me he's not honest.
Dear friend...
...no court can wait for saints
to provide evidence.
l shall be scrupulously just.
Surely you will rest on that.
l never doubted that, Thomas.
- Mr. Hale.
- Proctor.
Good evening to you, sir.
- You are Goodwife Proctor?
- Aye, sir, Elizabeth.
Are you aware your wife's name
is mentioned in the court?
our Mary warren told us.
we're entirely amazed.
l am a stranger here.
l find it hard to draw a clear opinion
of them that are accused.
So l go tonight from house to house.
l come now from Rebecca Nurse's house.
Rebecca is charged?
God forbid that such a one be charged.
But she is mentioned somewhat.
Mr. Hale...
...l hope you'll never believe
that Rebecca trafficked with the devil.
Goody Proctor, this is a strange time.
None can any longer doubt the powers
of darkness are attacking this village.
we have no knowledge
in that line, Mr. Hale.
l thought, sir, to put some questions as
to the christian character of this house...
...if you'll permit me.
we have no fear of questions, sir.
come in.
In the book of record Mr. Parris keeps...
...l note that you are come to Sabbath
meeting but 26 time in 1 7 month.
Sit down, Mr. Hale.
l'll be straight with you.
No minister before Parris ever demanded
the deed to the house we lend him.
The meetinghouse had pewter candlesticks
upon the pulpit.
when Mr. Paris came, he preached nothing
but golden ones until he had them.
when l look to heaven and see my money
glaring at his elbows, it hurt my prayer, sir.
lt hurt my prayer.
And your children.
How comes it the last is not baptized?
Mr. Parris won't lay his hand upon my baby.
l see no light of God in that man.
But the man's ordained.
Therefore, the light of God is in him.
what is your suspicion?
l hung the door of the church!
- That's a good sign.
- Maybe we are too hard on Parris.
But sure we never
loved the devil here.
Do you know your
commandments, Elizabeth?
l surely do.
l'm covenanted, sir. There be no mark
upon my christian life.
And you, mister?
Aye, l'm sure l do.
Let you repeat them.
- My commandments?
- Aye.
Thou shalt not kill.
Thou shalt not steal.
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's goods
nor make graven images.
Shalt not take the name
of the Lord in vain.
Thou shalt have no other gods
before me.
Thou shalt keep the Sabbath day holy.
Thou shalt honor thy father and mother.
Thou shalt not bear false witness.
- No graven- -
- You said that twice.
l know.
- Adultery, John.
- Aye.
You see, between the two of us, we do
know them all. l think it be a small fault.
Theology, sir...
...is a fortress.
No crack in a fortress
may be accounted small.
l bid you both good night, then.
Mr. Hale?
Mr. Hale.
l know the children's sickness had naught
to do with witchcraft.
what?
Parris discovered them sporting
in the woods.
- They were startled and took sick.
- who told you this?
Abigail williams.
Abigail told you it had naught
to do with witchcraft?
- She told me the night you came.
- why did you keep this?
l never knew till tonight
the world has gone mad with nonsense.
l have myself examined Tituba,
Sarah Good and 26 others...
...who have confessed
to dealing with the devil.
why not, when they must hang
for denying it? You ever thought of that?
l have a rumor you do not believe
there are witches in the world. ls that true?
The Bible speaks of witches, so- -
Sir, l am a good woman. l know it.
lf you believe that l may only do good
work and yet be secretly bound to Satan...
...then l must tell you
l do not believe it.
You bewilder him.
- But you do believe there are witches?
- lf l am thought one, then no.
You surely do not fly
against the Gospels?
Question Abigail williams
about the Gospels, not myself!
They've taken Martha and Rebecca!
on what charge?
The supernatural murder
of Putnam's babies!
Rebecca murdered children?
Are you still believing this?
Remember, until an hour before the devil
fell, God thought him beautiful in heaven!
