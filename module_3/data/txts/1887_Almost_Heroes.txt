So Terry,
how was your weekend?
Well, Pete was
out of town for some
medieval thing,
so I had to-
Don't care, I finished
my pre-teen vampire novel!
Oh, finally!
Since when do you write
pre-teen vampire novels?
Uh, since forever!
"Abigail Weatherworth
never expected to get fangs
before she got boobs."
Wow,
that sounds very niche.
It's semi autobiographical.
So, do you want
to read it?
I do not! I mean,
it's your only copy,
so I'd hate to...
read it.
It's called,
"Are you there God?
It's me, Dracula".
Wow,
what a terrible title.
It even has a 50 page
dictionary at the back,
so you can understand the bits
that I wrote in vampenglish.
It's a very old language
I just made up.
Words cannot express
how much I wanna read it,
but I've got too much
going on here, I'm busy.
But you'll be less busy
once Peter gets back from his trip.
Are you kidding me?
I got more done
this weekend
than all last month.
And we had two straight days
without a fire.
That's a record.
Come on,
it's only 500 pages!
Some of it even rhymes.
I'm sorry, Bernie.
My friend from Harvard
is in town,
and I don't even have
time to see him.
Why don't you just
take a day off?
<i>Sorry.</i>
No reason.
That one kinda got
away from me.
I'm a little drunk.
Whoo-hoo!

I'm sorry, Terry.
I wish you could've
been there.
What a mean thing
to say.
So, what exactly
were you doing?
Larping.
So, what exactly
were you doing?
Live action role playing.
- Fine, don't tell me.
- We dress in costume,
and hit each other
with swords.
Of course you do.
It's a weekend full
of magic, intrigue,
wine, and wenches.
Sounds like the stuff
of song.
Ooh,
I already wrote one!
I walked into this.
♪ Oh, the wine
it was a flowing, ♪
♪ and the wenches
were a blushing, and the- ♪
Okay, you will not believe
who was there, dude!
Trevor Stiles!
Not that guy
I've never heard of!
He's like the Wayne Gretzky
of larping,
and we fought him!
Good, you won,
now help me with these comics.
We didn't win!
Nobody beats
Trevor stiles.
<i>But still, the bards
will sing of it.</i>
♪ Oh, trevor had his axe out, ♪
♪ and the wenches
they were sad ♪
Okay.
Well, I'm glad you
enjoyed your day off.
That reminds me I'm gonna need
Friday off as well,
I wanna have a party for all my
larping buddies.
Oh come on, I haven't
had a day off in months!
So take a day off.
The store literally cannot
go a day without me.
Please Terry, I'm not
completely useless.
Remember? I built my own
scissorhands.
Aah!
An afternoon well spent.
Yesss!
Oh, what's your name?
Oh, no!
Oh, my fly's open.
Oh, now to do it up.
Which, I'm sure will be
a total success,
and completely uneventful.
What a terrible example.
Come on,
the store's doing fine.
And, I am getting better
with money.
Last week you tried
to buy a 500 dollar monkey
on the black market.
A smoking monkey.
That investment would've paid
for itself.
How would it have paid
for itself?
We would've sold him
the cigarettes!
Duh!
Yeah,
I can't leave you alone.
Terry,
the store is half mine.
Let me prove I can run it
on my own.
Okay,
I'll take the day off.
And he'll be just fine
on his own.
Stop doing that!
<i>All right, I taped emergency
<i>numbers to the counter,</i>
as well as instructions
for the espresso machine.
This just says,
"do not use."
Exactly,
for the love of God,
do not use that machine.
When you use that machine,
bad things happen.
Rayna,
I knew you'd come back.
- I come here every day.
- Me too!
We have so much
in common.
Mm, not really.
Why hello, Rayna.
One cappuccino.
I believe
it is your favourite.
Wow!
Thank you, Peter.
You made that?
With that machine?
What can I say, I have
everything under control.
Okay, great.
So...
I'll just go.
Is this a sock?
No refunds.
I haven't paid yet.
That'll be four dollars.
Terry!
Terry cloth!
Terry-dactyl!
Chet! Chet...Guy.
Chett-er cheese.
I didn't know
we were doing names.
That's hilarious!
Well, you look good.
Oh yeah,
I don't know.
I just threw this on.
Man,
is this your car?
Hey, no man,
now it's your car.
- What, really?
- No, not really.
No, it's a rental.
Oh, I'm just so excited
to see you, man!
Oh God, I'm nervous.
Are you nervous?
Okay.
So what are you
doing in town?
My company's expanding all over
the world, my friend.
Toronto, Vancouver,
<i>Dubai,</i>
- All right.
- <i>Hong Kong.</i>
Oh, listen to me,
I'm just listing places!
Breathe, you're good,
you're good.
We were gonna
build a facility
around the corner
from here, but...
your friend out there told us
this neighbourhood was a sinkhole.
Why am I not surprised?
How are you buddy?
You smell great!
Ha!
Oh, you know how it is.
I'm pretty successful.
Ha! No, you're not!
He runs a comic book store
with his brother.
<i>They sleep in bunk beds.</i>
That's only partially true!
That's only partially true.
Yeah, yeah.
What's that perfume
you're wearing?
- Pulled pork?
- Lame.
- Excuse me?
- You used that one last week.
You're running out
of material.
Well, you're running out
of time to have a baby.
Two weeks ago.
Bernie!
I need to talk to you.
Why? Did you finally
grow hair down there?
Uh, you tried that
on me last week.
Let me guess.
Terry can't stop talking
about my book,
now you wanna read it too.
What book?
You wrote a book?
My pre-teen vampire novel.
"Are you there, God?
It's me, Dracula!"
- What a terrible title.
- What?
I mean, you will really have
to show it to me sometime.
I've got your copy
right here!
Dear God,
it's upsettingly large!
Thank you.
Look, um Terry left me
in charge of the store,
and I can totally
handle it on my own,
but there's a bit
of a situation.
Oh, how bad could it be?
Mmm...
I'd say, how
about I buy you a car?
Hey, thanks so much
for lunch, man.
It was great hanging out
with an adult.
Yeah, yeah,
it was great.
Hey,
come work with me!
- What?
- You could run my...
Hong Kong office.
Chet, this is a huge
opportunity.
This would change
my whole life!
I don't think I can leave
my brother alone with the store.
Well, think it over.
I've gotta know
by noon tomorrow.
All right.
Oh!
Why hello, Terry.
<i>Back so soon?</i>
How time flies when
nothing eventful is happening.
Everything looks...
totally normal.
It is normal,
right, Bernie?
Totally normal, I didn't kiss
a woman with a beard.
What was that?
What was that?
I'm not a total screw up
who needs constant supervision,
I'm a professional.
Is that coming from
the air vents?
That is the furnace.
Huh.
It sounds like a monkey.
No, it's definitely
the furnace,
I will now...
go fix it,
like a professional would.
Just... one moment.
Please.
Okay.
Yah! Yah!
Looks like Peter's got
everything under control.
Absolutely.
You might even say
a circus full of freaks
never trashed the place.
Well, maybe I can go
after all.
What? Go?
Go where?
I just got offered
a job in Hong Kong.
But, but, but...
Okay.
Just a- ugh! Ugh!
Just a rat in a pillowcase,
not a monkey
in a pillowcase.
Who's angry,
I'll be right back.
You can't just leave!
He's gotten used to you
being here.
He even spends extra time
in the morning
getting dressed so tha
you'll notice me- him!
You're right.
He'll be crushed.
Unless I find the perfect
time to tell him.
Like at that party
he wanted to throw!
I'm not sure
that's a great idea.
Too late.
<i>And that's why you
don't tickle an ewok!</i>
Terry!
Oh, thanks for helping!
This is so much better
than my last party.
What are you looking at,
Dark Badger?!
<i>Oof!</i>
<i>Worst birthday ever.</i>
Yeah, so much better.
No problem, that's
what brothers are for.
Hmm?
Why the long face?
Did KFC raise the price
of gravy again?
Yeah, yeah,
I've heard it before.
Here's a new one.
"When Abigail entered the room,
even the teachers laughed."
"It's not easy
to do your make up
"when you can't see
your reflection!"
I think my brain
just puked.
That's chapter
thirty-seven!
You read thirty-seven
chapters?
Get a room.
Oh!
Ugh!
Terry,
this party is awesome!
It's got everything!
We've got hot girl
on bearded girl action,
cheezolas!
Ah, the worst haircut
I've ever seen in my life.
That is Trevor Stiles!
He is the larping king!
He's the coolest guy
I know.
<i>What?!</i>
<i>This guy?</i>
This is the coolest guy
you know?
What about me?
Well, you're the second
coolest.
Hey!
Okay, third coolest.
<i>Trevor, Trevor!
Of the House of Stiles.</i>
It is an honour
to have you at our party.
It really is.
I'm here for the wenches,
the wine,
and the cheezolas.
And now, if I may,
an elvish blessing.
He's so bad ass!
<i>So, you're happy?</i>
Oh! I am so happy,
right now I could take
any news.
Perfect! I got offered
a job in Hong Kong,
and I'm taking it.
What? When?
Tomorrow.
And you're telling me now?
Well, I wanted to wait 'til
you were in a good mood.
So you could ruin it?
You're-you're a snake!
You're a beer-soaked
snake!
You're gonna throw your
beer at me, aren't you?
Surprise!
Yeah, thought so.
Who dareth soak my cape?
Your ass is mine!
<i>Tomorrow, 5:00 pm.</i>
No holds barred!
Costumes optional.
Costumes optional.
You ladies are gonna have
one of your pretend fights?
Oof!
Nothing is
pretend anymore.
Come! If we hurry,
my mom will make us tacos.
Seriously.
I'm a dead man.
Don't worry.
Why?
Because you have my back?
Oh no wait, you don't,
'cause you're leaving!
Thanks for nothing!
<i>This is so bad.</i>
Do you wanna tell me about
what part you hate now?
Nope.
What about when Abigail wins the heart
of her werewolf soccer coach
by using the power
of imagination?
Terrible.
If you hate it so much,
then why read it?
I don't want to,
I have to finish every
book that I start.
It's a thing,
now get folding.
Huh.
Give me that back
to me!
I'm not finished
hating it yet!
Do you wanna find out what happens
to Abigail at the spring formal?
No!
Does Justin bring her
that garlic corsage?
Wouldn't you like
to know.
I must!
Then you get folding!
Bernie!
What am I gonna do?
Peter relax.
Perhaps with a good read?
Terry can't leave,
I have a fight today!
I don't know how
to run the store,
and we still haven't built
a tree house yet,
or planted that tree!
Peter, the other day
we chased away circus freaks,
wrangled a monkey,
and I kissed a bearded woman.
We lead full lives.
That was one hour.
Terry does it all day.
If he waited for
the perfect time,
- he'd never leave.
- Exactly!
He should never leave!
I mean, why does
he even wanna go?
Running a comic book shop
is the dream life!
But maybe not
his dream life.
You just blew my mind.
I have to let him go.
I know the perfect
goodbye gift.
Get that book out
of my face!
Hey, Pete!
<i>I've been thinking.</i>
About the fight,
how about you cry
like a little girl,
while I piss myself?
That way we'll be
too pathetic to punch.
The old number six.
What,
so you're not leaving?
I can't let you fight
him on your own,
he's the Wayne Gretzky
of... larking.
- Larping.
- Sure. who cares.
The point is,
there will be other
dream jobs.
At huge companies...
Overseas.
No, there won't.
You're taking the job.
I can't!
Trevor's gonna beat you up,
and you hate beatings.
I sure do,
but the fight's off.
What?
No fight! I simply
apologized to Trevor,
and it's all good.
See, I took care
of everything on my own.
Wow!
Good for you!
So, now you're free
to hop on that plane
and enjoy your in-flight
jacuzzis,
and shuffle board.
How do you know
so little about planes?
See Terry, my dream job
is to run a comic book store.
But you need to go out and find
your own "comic book store".
Thanks.
Sure, my "comic book store"
is an actual comic book store,
every man has his own
"comic book store."
Who knows what your
"comic book store" will be.
Stop saying
"comic book store."
Comic book store.
Well...
this is your last chance.
Come on, dive in.
The water's fine
I will almost miss
those lame pick-up lines.
You won't have to.
Wrote down a few
of the favourites.
They should get you
through a few weeks.
These are terrible,
thank you.
I made this for you.
This just says, "no."
Impressive!
- Take care of yourself.
- Yeah.
I hope you die
in a plane crash.
Or some God awful
disease.
As long as you die.
Oh, small penis!
I just got that.
I'm really gonna
miss you, Peter.
- Terry.
- Right!
And if in your travels you come
across a one legged man,
who answers to the name
of Vargas,
tell him
I want my life back!
- All right.
- All right.
- For the trip.
- A mixed CD?
No, it's the audio copy
of my book,
as read by me.
Oh, you shouldn't have.
We all know you don't
want that.
Give it to me!
Just give me a hint!
Is Montague gonna
repeat grade nine?
Come back soon.
Well, probably not.
Well, what can I say?
I'm gonna miss you, man.
Sssshh!
Don't speak.
Just-just go.
Yeah, well...
I will.
<i>You wanna get a drink?</i>
Can't! I have a fight
to train for.
I thought that
got cancelled.
Trevor Stiles never
misses a fight.
<i>No, I just couldn't
let Terry stay for me.</i>
But Trevor's gonna beat
the crap out of you!
Don't worry Bernie,
I have a plan.
What's the plan?
To come up with a plan!
Got it!
Dan!
I need you to train me.
Finally get into
the special Olympics?
I'm just joking.
Those guys
are real athletes.
I'm gonna fight the guy
who knocked you out.
And the enemy of my enemy
is my friend's enemy.
Close enough.
All right cream puff,
I'm in.
I'm out, this looks like
way too much work.
But the enemy of my enemy-
Hell, what do I care?
I hate both of you.
Either he gets beat up,
or you do.
Both ways I win.
I'll show you!
Yaaaah!
Oh! Aww!
You're going through
with this?
It's just something
I have to do.
Alone.
<i>Not quite!</i>
You came!
We could not let you
charge into battle alone.
Know this;
Whatever hell is unleashed
here today,
we will stand with you.
Easy, dear horse.
Holy shit,
he brought a horse.
Yeah.
We're out.
Damn it!
Boyd, do something.
He brought
a goddamn horse!
Prepare for Armageddon!
<i>Not quite yet!</i>
I will stand with you.
Terry!
You're here to save me!
Uh no, actually I didn't
even know you needed saving.
I'm kinda making
this up as I go!
Then why did
you come back?
For me.
I came back because...
Maybe my
"comic book store"
is actually a comic book
store too.
What the hell
are you talking about?
The comic book-
uh...
The point is,
maybe this is where
I belong.
<i>Ahem!</i>
Guy on a horse here.
Right, right.
Uh, well Trevor,
looks like you're
outnumbered.
Oh, really?
I don't think so.
To my side!
Okay well,
that was short lived.
<i>Guess this is it,</i>
we're doomed.
Not for long.
Friends, now is the hour
that we stand as men.
And some ladies,
thank you for coming out.
On this day,
with my brother
by my side,
I say to all of you...
Whoever sheds blood today,
shall be my brother too!
No chance!
Ten percent off comics
for the rest of the month.
- We're in!
- Yes!
All right! Let's go!
The numbers favour us!
Do they?
Or you need a new abacus?
Abacus?
Yes, yes!
My minions!
I was never
very good at math.
The time for ass kicking
is nigh!
I guess we get
our asses kicked now.
Together.
For the Silver Salmon!
Now do we start
hitting them?
Yes Terry,
now we start to hit them!
Unleash hell!
Excellent, knights!
<i>Strike fear in their hearts!</i>
Actually,
this is quite impressive.
Oh.
Or not.
Are those slapfests?
That's-
no, that's not very...
That's not very knightly.
All right,
you got me.
Good game.
<i>Ow!</i>
I'm surrounded
by Peters!
Yaaaaah!
Victory is in sight!
Now I will join the fray.
Ow! God! Ow!
Whoa, whoa!
What the hell?
Sorry!
I was trying to shoot
the sword out of your hand.
Yeah well, sorry doesn't
un-shoot my arm!
All right Peter, give it.
I have a bowling game
this weekend!
Well, I guess I don't.
So, I-I quit!
I don't wanna play anyway!
Sorry.
Sorry, everybody.
Sorry,
bad arrow safety.
Oh! Ah!
Stupid game!
You were good out there.
Thanks, so were you.
They okay?
They're being read
teen fantasy
by a real live girl.
This is their Christmas.
"There they stood.
Two lockers filled not
with books,
but with the undead bodies
of a prom king and queen.
"School's out for... never."
<i>Finally!</i>
What a piece of crap!
<i>"To be continued."</i>
Oh, come on!
Come to congratulate us
on our victory?
<i>It was impressive,
I know.</i>
True,
I've never seen a man
tickle someone
into submission before.
I'm not proud of that.
This is for you.
This just says "maybe."
Oh!
See? Together we can
handle anything!
Two brothers stand alone-
Two people can't be alone.
Two brothers,
versus the world!
Why is it us
versus the world?
Come on, Terry!
Fine,
just this once.
- Two brothers...
- Stand together.
Against all odds.
In an epic battle.
For the fate
of all mankind.
And they call themselves...
The masters of the Plazaverse!
That's a terrible title.
What?!
