Goddamn it!
Your last words last night.
The first words
from you this morning.
You think you should
expand your vocabulary?
While you expand your chest.
Get enough exercise
jogging this morning?
Don't you ever get tired?
I won't have time
for breakfast.
Why not? It's ready.
Denise Marshall's boy
wants a football.
I'll drop it off.
An autographed football
from you?
You haven't played football
in 16 years.
I guess it's part of
this nostalgia binge.
Anyway, it's the ball
Frank Gifford signed.
That's the signature he wants.
I find it peculiar,
almost amusing.
The widow Brian Marshall
comes back after seven months,
and you rush off
without even a cup of coffee.
If I ask you...
If you ask me to pick up
lettuce, I find some excuse.
Christ.
If it wasn't 7:30 a.m.,
I would have a drink.
You're a clock watcher?
What? What did you say?
I said,
"You're a clock watcher?"
Don't you dare
lower your voice to me!
What's this about?
I know you.
We've been married long enough.
The more contempt you feel
for me, the lower the voice!
Remy, you'd hardly
call this a marriage, would you?
I'm going now, Remy.
I said I'm leaving.
Remy?
Remy?
Remy?
Remy! Remy!
Jim, Stuart Graff.
She's done it again.
We'll get faster action
if you call the ambulance.
I'll induce vomiting.
I know the rules by now.
Just get over here.
Oh, my God! Aah!
Well...
If you throw pills
in the toilet, flush it.
That was a jolt.
Forget your coffee.
We got an emergency inspection.
I'm off duty soon.
It's just a little tremor.
That's a concrete dam.
Those are the rules, Max.
You can always use
the overtime.
MAX: I suppose so.
- Is everything OK?
- Yeah.
You check the base.
I'll look down below.
At 7:46 a.m.,
a earthquake registering 3.1
on the Richter scale...
was felt in Los Angeles.
No injuries were reported.
Minimal property damage...
Repeating a KJB alert...
Hello, Laura?
This is Mr. Graff.
My secretary in yet?
Oh. Tell her I'll be
a little late.
- All right.
- Let me speak to him.
Mr. Graff,
your father-in-law.
See me when you come in.
Let's go over
that Cameron matter.
I won't budge on this.
I don't want to lose
this contract.
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.
Fred?
Fred?
Fred! Fred!
Fred?
Watch it, Lou.
You nearly wracked us up.
See, I told you!
We'll hear about that one.
- Want to drive, Emilio?
- No. You're driving.
We're over the city line.
Captain will bust us if we
mess up in the county again.
You remember what happened
with Merle?
Still don't think his gun
went off by accident.
I get along fine
with nine toes.
I said stay out of the county!
Some guys are just
too goddamn dumb...
to stay where they belong!
Do you know who owns
that hedge you wrecked?
I'm going to tell you, Slade...
Zsa Zsa Gabor.
Corry? Forget about the dishes.
You'll be late for school.
Come on.
Go to Mrs. Clark's
when you come back.
She'll look after you
until I'm home.
Stuart. Hi. Come on in.
Hi. You brought it.
Sorry I forgot last week.
Where did Frank Gifford sign?
Right there
under the laces.
Thanks, Mr. Graff.
That will look great
on my bookcase.
That's really nice of you.
I couldn't let down
my last fan.
Hurry.
Have a good day.
- Good-bye, Mom.
- Bye-bye.
So long.
You know what?
I've got a part in a movie.
Great.
Yeah, great.
Three days shooting, 22 lines.
It's hard, I've been
out of it so long.
But I feel alive.
I didn't for so long
after Brian died.
I should get dressed. Did you
feel that tremor this morning?
It really wasn't very strong.
No? Would you like some coffee?
If there's an unbroken cup
that I can find.
- It'll have to be instant.
- Instant will be fine.
Barbara says
you're the best...
Barbara?
Yes. Barbara.
Your boss' secretary.
- Oh.
- And my one good friend.
Well, she says...
you're the best engineer
in the country.
Barbara's paid
to say things like that.
That's the script
of the movie I'm doing.
"Movie I'm doing."
That's the overstatement
of the year. Huh.
Here I am, two small scenes,
and I'm so worried,
I was up all night...
trying to figure out
how to make this thing work.
Can I help you?
Yes. You could
read the lines with me.
It's just one scene, one page.
I think I know it.
Right here, near the top.
OK, let me fill you in.
I play a bit player.
The part you read is
a big movie star:
A drunk, a gambler,
married 18 times,
the whole thing.
And there's a dinner party.
Now, an assistant director
invited me.
He's not enough of a gentleman
to pick me up.
I have to drive myself.
That's OK.
They're all talking about me
just before I come in.
Asking him the usual questions
about bit players.
Talk, talk, talk. I come in.
Introductions,
introductions.
Then our big star... you...
makes his appearance.
You ignore me
for quite a while.
So I say to you,
"Hello, Mr. Shepherd.
"It's been a long time.
How have you been?"
And you say...
"Do we know each other?"
You bet your ass.
That kind of a script.
Ha ha.
Oh, and my character is
supposed to be a nymphomaniac.
Yeah.
The director's a strong believer
in typecasting.
I'll cope with that.
Want it black?
Yeah, black's...
And don't worry.
- Worry? About what?
- I'm not a nympho.
I'm not Mary Poppins,
but I'm far from being...
What's the male equivalent
of a nympho?
Satyr, I think.
- Satyr?
- Yeah.
And, uh, you don't need
to worry, either.
Worry?
What I mean is
I'm not Billy Graham exactly,
but I'm no satyr.
Mm-hmm.
Jesus, that tremor
must have stopped the clock.
- It's after 9:00.
- I have a 10:00 call.
- I must go.
- I'm due at the office.
Thank you for everything...
the cueing, the football...
and the sympathy.
And as Mary Poppins
would say...
Bye-bye.
Eight stitches to close
his lower lip,
Six loosened teeth!
You don't do that
to a brother officer!
He's no brother officer.
Merle's a county cop.
I'm talking about Los Angeles
cops and county cops.
That kid stole a car.
He got stoned
and slammed into...
a little Mexican girl
about six years old.
She was thrown 15 feet
in the air.
Probably dead before
she hit the sidewalk.
Blood covered three whole
cement squares...
Not splattered. Solid.
Just like paint.
The driver never even
slowed down.
He almost got away because some
peckerwood in a cop's uniform...
was worried about a hedge!
You'll receive
formal notice of suspension...
and a date for
departmental trial.
Now get on home.
Hey, Lou. How'd it go?
Michelle,
get me the valley reading.
OK. Have they
plotted the epicenter yet?
Yes, sure was.
Quite a shock.
Nevertheless, there's
no scientific evidence...
that a 3.1 earthquake
can loosen dental fillings.
No. Right. Thank you.
Walt!
Your turn on the P.R. desk.
Yes, that's right.
Dr. Adams. Room 14.
He isn't? Then I'd like
to leave a message.
- Walt!
- Just a minute, OK?
Have him call Walter Russell
at the Seismology Institute.
Yeah, it's very important.
Yes, thank you.
Here's a strange one.
Caretaker at
the Hollywood Reservoir Dam...
drowned at the bottom
of an elevator shaft.
They still haven't
figured out what happened.
OK.
What's the matter?
You look sick.
I found out Dr. Adams
stayed up at the fault.
So?
I sent some figures
in a memo...
into the Director's office
yesterday afternoon.
I don't think he's read them.
Figures on what?
I know you'll laugh...
but I think we're going
to have a really big quake.
Probably today,
tomorrow at the latest.
I wanted Dr. Adams here
to back up my computations.
Thought you
left yesterday, Dr. Adams.
We hope to have
the instruments planted by noon.
Still haven't figured out
what you're trying to do.
It's rather technical.
That device records minute
variations of seismic waves.
Well, better start my plowing.
Thanks for letting us
on your land, Mr. Griggs.
One the trench is filled in,
you'd never know we were here.
- Well?
- That was nice.
You'll have this thing
ready this afternoon?
I'll have it ready.
Don't worry.
We'll need
an extra can of butane.
Come on, Sal.
We'll pick one up when
we go for Rosa this afternoon.
All right.
She going to help us?
Yeah, yeah.
She'll help us.
She's not too crazy
about our work.
Miles, I'll get her.
Well, you better,
because this Vegas job...
is our big break.
I'll get her.
What do you want?
Will you relax? Jesus.
Wow.
73...
$5.49...
.89...
.89.
That'll be $20.16.
- Forgot to bring enough cash?
- That's right.
I'll put this back.
Who needs protein anyway?
Don't worry about it.
Drop the money off next time.
Thanks.
Find anything?
All OK as far as I can tell.
I'll check again.
I guess we won't find anything
until the shaft is pumped out,
but everything looks fine.
Right. People drown
in elevators every day.
Can you order these
freaks out of here?
They're scaring
my customers away.
I've tried to get them to leave.
You got something against
religion?
What will you have?
Double bourbon, Jay.
In uniform, Lou?
Naked and a glass
will do just fine.
Spiro T. Agnew.
You asked to see me,
Dr. Stockle?
Sit down.
Russell,
this is very interesting.
You forecast an earthquake...
in the three-
to four-point range.
We had an earthquake
in that range.
- I'm impressed.
- Thank you, sir.
However,
isn't it slender evidence...
for predicting a catastrophe?
Sir, these are based on
this morning's signals...
from those stress measurement
instruments Dr. Adams sank...
during that
experimental well project.
They indicate another pre-shock,
probably before noon today.
If it happened?
Then the big one follows
in 48 hours.
At least seven point.
Naturally, if that second
minor shock doesn't occur...
then my computations are based
on insufficient evidence.
I think we have a strong...
Russell, you are still
a graduate assistant.
Are you seriously contending
that a graduate assistant...
will be the first scientist to
pinpoint a major earthquake...
within 48 hours?
No, sir.
I'm following through
on Dr. Adams' theories...
and the probability curves
that he drew up.
I've been on the project...
Dr. Adams is
on a field trip upstate.
- I sure wish he wasn't.
- Thank you, Russell.
No. Leave those.
Beaulah, I want some figures
run through the computer.
Get Frank Adams for me
in Fresno.
Yeah? Morning, Sam.
Morning, Stu.
Listen, uh...
You still refuse to handle
the Cameron job...
unless he upgrades
the specifications?
Absolutely.
OK.
But you have to convince him
changes are necessary.
I could never talk him
into anything.
Oh, do me one more favor...
don't muff the deal.
Oh, just a moment. Mr. Royce?
Your daughter's on the phone.
3-4-7.
- Thank you.
- He'll be right on.
Remy? Hello, darling.
Fine.
I was planning on eating
in the building.
Well, come on in.
No. Away from the office.
It's terribly important.
Oh. OK, honey.
The Windsor at 1:15?
And try to calm down.
OK.
Bill, here comes another one.
It's a pretty good shake.
Shit!
Hey, that shot didn't count.
No way can it count.
Nothing in the rule book
about earthquakes.
It didn't count.
Hardly ever get
two in one morning.
Two what?
Earthquakes.
Soon, I won't feel
the big one...
that's supposed
to hit California.
Aah!
The Captain's cooled off.
He'll do his damnedest
to straighten things out.
I don't want to be
a cop anymore.
Since I was a kid,
I thought cops helped folks,
folks who couldn't
help themselves.
Maybe that's dumb,
but that's how I figured it!
Aah!
Folks don't count for a diddly.
Do they?
Take it easy.
I'll call you later.
Sure, Emilio.
The shot counted.
Bobby Riggs.
That wasn't there
before the tremor.
It's a new one.
I'm a technician.
You're a watchman.
Don't teach me my business.
It wasn't there!
There's no such thing
as solid concrete.
, jwcracks appear.
You don't panic over them.
The water's up half an inch.
He's right.
What the hell is going on?
It could all be coincidence.
I don't see running wild
over some untested theory...
at least until we've heard
from Frank Adams.
After all, it's his
research project, not Walt's.
We can't find Frank Adams.
No one was sure the atom bomb
would work till they dropped it.
Our present problem is...
what do we do now?
We warn people.
Do we?
Think about it.
A public announcement now...
that a major earthquake
is imminent.
That could create
incredible panic.
People climbing over people
trying to leave the city.
That could be worse
than the quake itself.
An orderly evacuation
could save thousands.
Orderly evacuation to where?
Desert? Mountains?
How do you feed and shelter
four million people?
Suppose we release
this info, and there's no quake.
Why predict a quake
and then take no action?
Russell! Russell, look.
Dr. Johnson and I
are not cynical.
A false alarm, even if it only
went to the governor's office,
would destroy
the Institute's credibility.
Credibility?
Five years from now,
we develop a detection system,
who will believe us then?
Yeah?
No. No, don't call his wife.
I'll take care of that myself.
Frank Adams is dead.
So is Jean Paul.
They were working the trench...
across the fault.
The walls collapsed.
Fiona...
get me the mayor's office.
It's a matter
of gravest urgency.
Push the blueprint room
on those revised drawings...
for the Cameron job, Carl.
- I want to see them today.
- OK.
This place is closing in on me.
Denise. Hi.
You finished working already?
Never got started.
The tremor damaged the set.
They rescheduled my scene
for tomorrow.
I'm dropping in on Barbara.
- Something wrong?
- No. I...
I need a drink.
Oh. You one of those
solitary drinkers?
Not if I can help it.
- Will you join me?
- Yeah.
You realize
what you're asking?
What's happening with you two?
He's been seeing
Brian Marshall's widow.
He feels obligated
to help her and her boy.
Albert Schweitzer wasn't
that dedicated to mankind.
There's more to it, Remy.
It was Stuart who assigned Brian
that propane cavern job.
He's blamed himself
for what happened.
Dad, don't be so naive.
They're having an affair.
When you met Stuart,
he was a dirt-poor boy...
going to college
on an athletic scholarship.
I think you still
half-see him that way.
He's a top man now.
He doesn't need me or anybody.
Every firm in town
would take him.
How big a quake?
A seven on the Richter scale.
Possibly higher.
That could release more
than the energy generated...
by the Hiroshima and Nagasaki
nuclear bombs combined.
You know
I can't issue a warning.
We know that's impossible.
There are some precautions
you could take, aren't there?
Alert the police,
the fire department;
have the governor mobilize
the National Guard.
He could announce
that it's necessary...
to prevent looting
at the Valley quake site.
The police have that situation
totally under control.
The next situation,
if it comes...
...would be somewhat different.
Governor and I
aren't even in the same party.
If this is a false alarm,
he'll make me look like a fool.
Second biggest.
I'll top the list.
- What do you say, Lou?
- Hiya, pal.
Rosa, the ladies room
is through that door.
Still pursuing
those evil-doers?
Not as hard as usual.
A couple burgers
and some orange juice to go.
Two burgers,
orange juice to go!
Right.
Fifty bucks, Miles. You owe me.
- I'll pay you tomorrow.
- The 50.
You're a great bike rider
but a lousy pool shooter.
Officer, you won't
let him get away with this?
Yes.
Fifty bucks,
or I'll break your back.
Peter Fonda.
Peter Fonda.
Hey, Sal, easy.
- Here, take it. Take it.
- Thanks... brother.
Mother.
Miles, what are you doing?
I got a dollar and loose change.
Hey, Lou.
Lend me 10 bucks.
- I can't go to the bank.
- Stop breathing gas fumes.
Lou, this is an emergency.
We need that butane tank
for the stunt.
That bastard
left me 10 bucks short.
Uh-uh.
I'll have it
back to you tomorrow.
Come on, Lou.
This is really important to me.
This big Vegas hotel guy
is coming to see this act.
There's never been
anything like this.
If that hotel sponsors us,
I could wind up
on ABC's Wide World of Sports.
After that, you could forget
about Evel Knievel.
It would be just
the Miles Quade story.
I'm sorry I arrested you two.
I been paying for it ever since.
Hello.
Rosa, meet Lou Slade.
He flattened Miles and I
with a blackjack...
at the North Hollywood rally
last year.
Yeah, that's right.
We didn't start that ruckus.
Should have knocked
their brains in place.
I want to talk to you.
Listen, if I had the bread,
I'd hire a beautiful,
sexy broad this afternoon...
and kick your ass
all the way home.
I don't need your help.
Now, Rosa, listen to me.
Daredevil motorcyclists need
sexy broads hanging around.
You want us
to look like phonies?
Sal, I'm your sister.
What about Maureen?
She's your girlfriend.
Rosa,
Maureen is too flat-chested.
Yeah.
Rosa, come here.
Now, Rosa,
show the officer your T-shirt.
Take a look at this.
We'll have 30,000 of these made
after the Vegas show.
Take a look.
I think it's beautiful.
My wife will ask me,
"Is she pretty?"
And I'll say, "Quite."
Then she'll say, "That figures.
Tell me about her."
And you'll say,
"Nothing much to tell.
"We just had a drink."
And she'll ask me,
"No small talk?"
Very little. A trait
that goes with engineering.
Maybe it does.
It's good.
Can I ask you something?
Sure. Anything.
When we made love...
When you made love to me...
it was with such...
I'm looking for the right word.
It was with such... anger.
- Anger?
- Yeah, anger.
- Did I anger you?
- No.
I think you are
absolutely lovely.
Well, I think so, too.
I'm not hurt.
Tell me, how long has
Barbara worked at the office?
Oh... 10, 12 years.
Did you ever know me
to drop in on her before?
No. Certainly not
since you got back to L.A.
Maybe I didn't want
to see Barbara.
Maybe I wanted to see you. Hmm?
How about that?
Yeah, how about that?
So you didn't seduce me.
- I seduced you.
- Great.
Well... next time,
I'll do the honors.
Don't feel
there has to be a next time.
Don't think that you've just
made a lifelong commitment.
- Come here.
- Why?
Come here.
I'm going to Oregon this summer.
All summer.
Hydroelectric project.
Come up there... with Corry.
I'll rent a house for you two.
Such beautiful,
really beautiful country.
It would be great for you.
- Please.
- I'll think about it.
I'll come back tonight.
I'll think about that, too.
We bring you a special bulletin.
The governor's put the following
National Guard units...
on emergency active duty status:
The fourth infantry
support group,
the 227th
heavy transport battalion,
the 112th headquarters company,
the 33rd
communications battalion,
the 47th engineers company.
Oh, my God.
Let me show you
what's happening.
We start up there.
Then it's down that ramp,
into that first big loop,
up this ramp,
zoom over the truck,
down this ramp,
into that big figure eight.
Then down that ramp,
into that fire ring.
That fire ring doesn't just
have flames on the outside.
We rigged those gas jets
to shoot flames in the center.
Then down that ramp,
over that pit, and home free.
You take a guy like Knievel.
He'll jump 20, maybe 30 cars...
and call it
a big goddamn thing.
But, baby, let me tell you,
compared to those,
landing on a car
at 100 miles an hour...
that's like landing in bed.
Miles, you're out of your mind.
- Rosa...
- No!
If you want to help kill him...
- Don't be rough.
- Nothing to it.
It is simple!
Who are you kidding?
I'm going to a movie.
Clint Eastwood at the Royal.
- Rosa, wait!
- Ciao.
You're gonna fix it up.
- All right! She's nervous.
- Yeah, sure.
- Where's them cantaloupes?
- We asked for free cantaloupes.
What kind of friend are you?
Still playing soldier?
Right. We saw on television.
Say, say, say.
Is it true that
blonds have more fun?
Oh, look.
I told you he was a fag.
Say, Jody, you a fag?
If I'd known,
I'd have been here before.
Could have used the money.
Fall in!
Left! Right! Left! Right!
Let's decorate the warrior!
Eyes to the front, Soldier.
The motion in this model...
was programmed from the actual
recorded ground motion...
of a 6.2 earthquake.
Long Beach in '33.
A magnitude of eight
would produce...
What's your point?
We're in an earthquake zone.
What can I tell you?
Have I failed to meet
state requirements?
I think we should go
beyond the codes.
You remember the Sylmar quake.
A lot of buildings that
met the code collapsed.
You know how much money
I pour into this company?
You bet I do.
You're willing to risk
losing my business for this?
Yes, I am.
The revised prints
are in my office...
for you to go over.
I'll see what it costs.
I thought you'd chew me out
for leaning on Cameron.
I figured it was time
to stay upstairs.
I like the feel of that name...
chairman of the board.
Has a nice ring.
- Congratulations, Mr. President.
- Jesus!
Thanks, Sam.
You'll have to forget
about that Oregon project.
We can't have
our new company president...
pouring cement out in the woods.
What's the matter?
I promoted you, not fired you.
No. It...
Sam, you're gonna figure
I'm crazy, but, um...
I'd like time
to think this over.
OK.
Any problems
I ought to know about?
No. Just a few priorities I've
got to get straight in my head.
- Sure.
- Sam.
Did Remy have anything
to do with this?
You'd have this job even
if you weren't my son-in-law.
Hold that.
- Hello.
- Hello, Denise.
Stuart. Hi.
Look, I can't make it tonight.
Something came up at work.
- Any trouble?
- No, no trouble.
- I just got a problem to solve.
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorrier than you are.
Oh, it doesn't matter
about tonight.
We'll have lots of time
together... up in Oregon.
- OK? Bye-bye.
- Bye.
Mom? Mom?
Yeah?
Can I go to the playground?
Sure.
Be careful crossing that bridge.
Corry, if I'm not home
when you get back, don't worry.
I might take a walk.
I'll leave the door unlocked.
I'll make a practice run.
Loosen up the machine.
All right, Sal!
Miles! Jesus!
- Aah!
- Jesus!
Miles, you all right? Huh?
Came out of the damn thing.
What happened? Huh?
Help me try again.
Listen to me.
We got one 250 left, understand?
I got to try it again!
- You're the boss.
- Come on.
All right, Miles, come on, baby.
Let her roll!
...delay in the contract.
I suggest...
- Barbara.
- Mm-hmm?
- You knew Brian Marshall?
- Yes.
Ever meet his wife?
Sure. We see each other
all the time.
- What's she like?
- She's a very nice girl.
I was afraid of that.
Yes?
Your daughter's on her way in.
Fine. Remy.
Good afternoon, Mrs. Graff.
Hello, Barbara.
Have you spoken to Stuart yet?
Yes. Said he wanted
to think about it.
Miles, here he comes now,
the guy from Vegas.
This will be
my greatest run.
I'm tuned to the right pitch.
Ha ha ha!
Go home.
Put this out of your mind.
You look exhausted.
Thanks, Dad.
Sam...
Hello, Remy.
Well, I guess you've
got yourself a new president.
Great!
And you'll stay away
from that Marshall woman.
Stuart.
Stuart, wait!
Stuart!
Where are you going?
- Anywhere. A bar.
- Why are you so angry?
Remy, don't you understand?
That was a bribe.
Our whole marriage has been
a series of bribes.
- And you took them.
- It's time I quit.
You're going to see
that Marshall bitch, right?
- Not until tonight.
- Finally, you admit the truth.
It wasn't the truth
till today.
It was never the truth.
It is now.
Bastard!
- Max.
- Hey!
I found the trouble.
The earthquake
busted the conduit.
It's flooded
the bottom of the shaft.
Get down!
Don't go in there!
Oh! Holy mother of God!
Help me!
Oh, God, help me! Help!
Aah!
Oh, my God!
Mother!
Oh, God!
Mom! Mother!
Turn off the gas!
Oh, my God.
Stay here.
- Oh!
- Yeah. Al?
Is there a doctor
around here?
Is there a doctor?
Barbara! Barbara! Barbara!
Mr. Cameron threw me
out of the elevator,
and then I heard
all those people screaming!
Probably the first time...
the old bastard ever
did anybody a favor! Ha Ha.
All right,
take it easy, everybody!
It's over now. It's over.
Take care of it!
Get the first-aid kits.
All right, now, listen to me,
everybody! Let's settle down!
The worst is over.
Understand?
The worst is over.
What's happening?
What's happening?
What's the matter?
Hey, break the windows,
Carl, over there!
It's plastic gas!
Get out of here!
Come on, hurry up! Hurry up!
Don't stop!
Hang in there!
Hang on, buddy! Hang in there!
Argh!
Corry!
Corry!
Calling Van Nuys.
Calling Van Nuys.
We got clobbered,
but we have mobile units.
Get to the control panel.
Fire is out of
control at Van Nuys Hospital.
All roads blocked
between Victory and Kittering.
Can I broadcast to the city,
get picked up
on transistor sets?
Some stations
are still operating.
We could rig
a microwave relay to one.
Get on it, then!
Hey, you, come here!
Help this guy, dammit!
Slide him out from under there.
What do you have to do
to get a drink around here?
Shut off that gas valve!
Help me. Help me.
You guys,
check that at both sides!
You two, check up here,
both sides.
Couple of guys down below.
It held! My God, it held.
How much longer?
I'll divert water
into the spillways.
We must reduce pressure.
Not without
official permission, you're not.
It's dead.
I told you to leave that alone!
The city's going to need water.
There are dozens of fires
already.
If this dam busts,
there won't be nothing
left to burn!
The quake may have broken
something inside.
It won't budge!
- It won't budge!
- Oh!
Stuart!
You'd better get out of here!
The whole building
is full of plastic!
You'd better get out.
Maybe there's some way down
through an elevator shaft.
Watch yourself.
Shut the door.
Come here. Come here. OK.
Shut it.
Hurry!
Get me a chair with arms.
Throw it down there.
Get back.
All the way! Feed it!
Here, hold it.
Pull the chair up. Hold it up.
We need something
to strap them in.
Pantyhose.
Barbara, take off
your pantyhose, dammit!
You, too! Come on.
Take off your pantyhose!
Get her down. Get her down.
Here's one.
Here comes the first one!
Let her down as slow as you can.
And keep down the sway!
Steady...
It's OK. You made it.
- Help.
- It's all right now.
Let me try again.
Try it again.
Yeah. Yeah!
- You owe me a six-pack.
- You got it.
Corry!
My sweet...
Oh, hi, baby. OK.
I'll get you up.
It will be all right.
I'll lift you up.
OK, try...
Help!
I don't believe it.
I don't believe it!
- What do you mean?
- Busted!
The ramps are busted.
The loops are busted.
The rings are busted.
I hope to God Evel Knievel
was in town today.
Why? Huh?
Help!
Please help me! Help!
Help! Help!
Here! Down here!
Help me! My son is hurt.
Come on!
OK.
Take it easy, lady.
Boost him up here.
Boost him up.
Slowly!
Got him? Got him?
Yeah, I got him.
Be careful.
Stay there.
Watch those wires.
It'll be hours before
we drain enough to do any good.
Help!
Help me!
Come on, lady!
- Help me!
- Come on!
Put him right here.
Where we gonna take him?
No hospital for miles.
Guess we better head
for the police station.
Yeah. Yeah, let's go.
How can I find out
about my daughter?
- You got to help me...
- Where's the firemen?
Please, help me find a doctor!
Shut up! You're all going
to have to help yourselves.
Most of the police were killed.
The guys on patrol
when the quake hit...
probably got plenty to do.
Get as many volunteers
as you can.
Go to that hardware store.
If it's locked, break in.
Find the picks and shovels.
Looking for people
who are buried alive.
There are plenty of them.
- Move your ass!
- Let's go.
Women and kids that have houses
in any shape at all,
go to them and stay there.
Turn off the gas lines...
I'm getting something.
Stand by
for a message from the mayor.
The city has suffered
the greatest natural disaster...
in the history of the U.S.
The state and the nation
are rallying to our aid.
But for the next few hours,
until massive help can reach us,
we'll have to depend on...
our own physical
and spiritual resources.
Private physicians should report
to emergency aid stations...
now being set up at key sites
throughout the city.
Bring all the medical supplies
you can carry.
Clinics have been established
at the following locations:
The Hollywood Bowl,
the Occidental Insurance
building, the Wilson Plaza...
Laura! Laura, my father,
is he all right?
My father!
Laura! My father! Oh!
Come on, you're next. Move!
Ah!
You all right?
Why didn't you go ahead
of some of the younger guys?
Staying up here was crazy.
I'm not strong enough
to lower you,
so prepare for a jolt.
Oh!
Look out!
Let's get out of here.
Give me a hand.
- Watch yourself.
- OK.
Do you know Denise Marshall?
- Yes.
- Get to a phone.
- Find out if she's OK.
- The phones work?
- Try! Please!
- OK.
Let's get out of here.
Officer!
Are the phones working?
Out all over the city.
Hey, Lou!
- Miles.
- We got a hurt kid.
He's in shock.
Keep him warm
until we get him to a doctor.
Can find your way
to Wilson Plaza?
Got an emergency
medical station there.
I got to find my sister.
We've got injured to move.
You're gonna move them!
Give me the bike.
I got to find Rosa...
Do what he says!
I'll find Rosa.
I'll get around
better than anybody.
OK, move out, single file.
- Hey, grab the cash!
- OK.
This way.
Let's go this way.
Hey! Get away from
that cash register!
I'm trying to get home.
I'm hungry.
We have strict orders
on looters.
They're all to be arrested.
No exceptions!
Come on. Let's go. Come on!
Cars must
leave the garage area...
after dropping off patients.
Hot coffee and food
is available...
in basement shopping levels
two and three.
Please keep moving.
Right along.
Please keep moving.
More doctors are waiting
at the first garage level.

Hold it. Hold it.
Oxygen.
Get me a blood pressure.
Wait. How do you feel?
H-Hard to breathe.
- Chest pains?
- Yeah.
He's had a heart attack.
Come on.
Start him on 5%% % dextrose...
Stuart!
I need to find
Denise and her boy.
Is she more important than me?
Than our life together?
Remy, for God's sake...
- Please...
- I'm sorry.
Good-bye.
Cars must leave
the garage area...
after dropping off patients.
Please keep moving.
Hot coffee and food
is available in...
I'm talking with the people
at the dam, Mayor,
and they're maintaining
a constant inspection.
Can't take any chances, Colonel.
Dr. Stockle said
we can expect aftershocks.
I got a report from
the building safety department.
They say some structures
may look perfectly sound...
but have been so weakened
that a tremor can destroy them.
Evacuate the area
immediately below the dam.
This is
a precautionary evacuation.
We repeat, there is no present
danger of the dam collapsing.
Move to high ground...
west of Highland Avenue
and north of Franklin.
This is
a precautionary evacuation.
I'm leaving!
We repeat...
Wait! They're not lying
to you. You got plenty of time!
Stay there. Stay there.
Come on, lay down.
You're gonna be all right.
Halt!
- Hey, Sid.
- Hi.
How come you took
this bunch prisoner?
Suspicion of looting.
How about turning that girl
over to me? She's a friend.
Yeah, sure. Hey, you.
Come here. Yeah, come on.
Can I go home now?
No.
You're my responsibility.
It's a couple dozen blocks
to your house.
It's getting dark.
The animals are loose.
You just make yourself
comfortable inside the store.
I have to send out patrols.
Patrol that area up there!
Watch out for looters!
Move out!
Sarge,
look what we found.
Jody! For Christ's sake,
what a break!
Caught these guys.
Their car had broke down.
Look at the goodies
they had with them.
Should we shoot them?
We've been putting you on.
You can't kill guys for that.
Maybe they didn't steal
these necklaces and things.
Maybe they're fags that like to
dress up in women's jewels.
- Find any dresses in the car?
- No, Jody.
I guess we'll have to shoot 'em.
I told
these guys to lay off. Ask 'em.
Yeah.
Those naked guys on the wall
meant nothing.
We knew you lifted weights.
Scum like you
get away with anything...
push people around,
steal all you want to,
make fun of men
who work for a living.
Come back, guys!
I was only kidding!
Hey, don't do that, man.
Aah! Oh!
Not like back in the store, eh?
No scrawny bitches coming in
asking for green stamps...
two days after
the special's over, huh?
Move out!
I want this area quarantined!
Question all civilians
that come through.
They might be looters.
And the people going
to Wilson Plaza aid station?
- I meant everybody!
- There's no other clear streets.
Move out!
Denise?
Denise!
- All right, out.
- What?
You can walk.
I got injured to move, and fast.
- That dam can go any minute.
- I've got people to find.
This thing looks like
it'll go anywhere.
- Now, get out!
- Just a minute...
You're one of those
troublemakers.
I've never shot
a troublemaker before.
Look... l'm looking for
a girl and a little boy.
- They mean a lot to me.
- Send your butler.
Where's the shift?
Well, depends on
what you want to do.
That's
a customized transmission.
It's got eight forward speeds.
And three reverse.
All of them harder to operate
than that.38.
All right...
you're an ambulance driver.
What?
Sorry.
It's been a hell of a day.
OK, that's it.
We got one more.
We desperately
need blood type AB negative.
Check the blood bank
and report back.
Coffee and food
is available in the basement.
- We finally made it.
- Careful.
A long time
to go a couple of miles.
Those not needing medical aid...
I got to go.
I got to move the truck.
Thank you very much.
He's had a bad fall,
hit his head, won't come to.
- Can I go with him?
- No.
We'll get in touch with you.
On the third level.
- Thank you.
- Right around there.
Coming through.
I've been in pain
for an hour.
Can I have a pill, please?
Aspirin, anything?
Please give me something
for the pain... please.
Please stay away
from the field hospital.
Somebody! Doctor!
Nurse! Anybody!
Building must have
its own generator.
There's not enough room.
Where is everybody coming from?
Someplace else.
We don't have
anymore room here.
Barbara!
- Barbara! Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm just terrified. You?
I'm fine. Corry had a fall.
He's with the doctor.
Stuart Graff? Is he OK?
Yeah, he's OK, but Mr. Royce
had a heart attack.
- A heart attack?
- I'm waiting for the doctor.
I've got to go out for some air.
Will you come with me?
No, I'd rather stay here.
I'll see you later. Take care.
He's gone.
He never had a chance.
Should I tell
his daughter?
I don't want any deaths reported
until things settle down.
Miss Amici?
Miss Amici?
You better eat.
This is nice and fresh
from the deli.
Many guys with hair over
regulation length wear them.
Oh.
I really used to look forward to
seeing you in the supermarket.
You never complained like
all the rest of those women.
Thank you.
I hope the lousy store
was knocked flat.
Pretty soon, I'll have enough
saved to open a karate school.
There's money in karate.
I'll give you free lessons.
I'm not really very hungry.
It's a hot night out.
You should take off that jacket.
You always liked me, too.
I could tell.
You never said anything,
but I could tell.
D-don't hurt me.
It's no real fun that way.
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, fine.
Another one of those
damned earth slides over there?
Uh-huh.
- Jesus, that's a scary sound.
- Uh-huh.
How is he?
He's going to be all right.
Mild shock, a concussion.
- I gave him something to sleep.
- Where are you taking him?
To the Army x-ray trucks
in the garage.
Doctor!
Why aren't you with my father?
Uh...
Don't bother me now.
Get down!
Get down!
Red Cross
emergency aid stations...
You know the way
to Wilson Plaza?
That's where I just came from.
The mayor has not
yet released a damage report.
However, details are expected
momentarily. Please stand by...
There's other buildings
sure to be down.
First time in my life
I'm ashamed of my profession.
We never should have built
those 40-story monstrosities.
Not here.
- Hey.
- What's the matter?
The door's out of line.
It wasn't before that aftershock
a few minutes ago.
Don't be scared.
We'll feel those quivers
for days.
That looks great. A pretty girl
should have nice things.
I've always thought so.
Forget how it used to be.
Your brother could be dead.
Nobody left but me
to take care of you.
Well, I've got another brother
in San Francisco.
And he's in the Mafia.
There's
another car coming, Jody.
This area's quarantined.
You'll have to detour.
I'm a police officer.
We're transporting the injured.
This is an emergency.
What isn't after an earthquake?
Take them to
a Hare Krishna temple.
Lou, help me! He's nuts!
Crazy!
What are you doing? I know her.
- She's under detention.
- Take it easy.
- All right.
- OK.
- Go back the way you came.
- OK.
Move out!
Don't leave me with him!
Lou!
Lou! Help me!
Lou! Help me!
Lou!
I'm going for an officer.
That guy in there is cracked.
Hey, come on!
Pull up 100 feet.
Pull around the corner
and stop.
Nuts am I, huh?
You got your nerve.
Only a whore would wear that.
Rosa?
Let's go. Better not!
Come on, Rosa, settle down.
Earthquakes bring out the worst
in some guys.
Here, come on, look.
Look at what you've got
to take care of.
My brother told me you were
a strange kind of cop.
Structures
collapsed during the aftershock.
The worst disaster was...
the supposedly earthquake-proof
Wilson Plaza.
The Army is rushing all
available workers to the scene.
Stand by for further bulletins.
Oh, my God.
Inspector!
Inspector!
Hold it. Stop.
You can't go any farther.
I'm a police officer,
transporting injured people.
OK, come on.
- I'm sorry, you can't...
- I have to get through.
- I know them. It's urgent.
- Listen!
Mr. Graff! Remy and Mr. Royce
are still down there.
Denise, too. She asked for you.
Where are they in the building?
The third level below.
Come on.
I agree.
There's a chance people could
be alive in the subbasement.
Take days to unearth
all this debris.
Look, their air supply can't
last more than a few hours.
I know this building.
I've been through it 100 times.
The basement extends to
the street on this side.
If he storm drain's deep enough,
all you'd have to tunnel
through is concrete and dirt.
I just got word
that the dam is disintegrating.
We're on high ground here, but
those drains are 40 feet down.
If the dam goes,
they'll fill up in minutes.
Dams have lasted weeks
with major breaches.
Too dangerous to try.
Besides, the sewer is cracked.
The eastern approach
is totally blocked.
And the other end?
I'm calling
an inspection team.
See for yourself.
Let's go.
Make way, fellas.
- Lou, where are you going?
- 'm going with them.
Let's have a look.
- Can't you get through here?
- I don't know how far this runs.
- Haven't you checked?
- My men stay here!
That could cave in any second!
You know as well as I do...
chances are everybody is dead.
Sweet mother.
I got through.
Can you get me a jackhammer...
Use a jackhammer,
the roof will fall in.
There's people alive in there.
I'm going to get them out.
Well, nobody else is,
and you can't do it alone.
I won't be alone.
He's coming with me.
Be sure they don't turn on
the compressor until we signal.
- Right.
- Any word from the dam?
The last report said no further
cracks have appeared.
- Swell.
- Can't I talk you out of this?
I really wish you could.
Good luck.
Watch your head.
Keep it coming.
I paced it off.
We ought to break through
about the third basement level.
- This thing ready?
- The pressure's ready.
I'm getting out of here!
Inspector!
Inspector!
Get the hell out of here!
It's breaking up! Get out!
Should be a couple feet of
earth, then the basement wall.
Hand me that light.
We're through!
Oh, my God!
They're through! We're saved!
- Anybody in there?
- About 70 of us!
Help her.
Give me a hand.
Got it.
- Stuart.
- Denise.
Come on, let's go.
OK, go ahead.
Be careful of the loose
area down there.
Easy, easy, easy.
Careful of the loose stuff.
Hold on! Oh, not again!
- It stopped! It stopped!
- Take it easy.
Now, watch your head down below.
I got you.
Aah!
Take your time.
Watch the loose stuff.
Give us a hand here!
Straight on up.
Nice and easy.
OK.
- That's all of them. Let's go.
- Yeah.
Watch it!
Don't panic, now!
-Women first!
- Come on, come on!
Relax, there's time.
Take it easy!
Take it easy.
One at a time. Women first!
Take it easy!
Don't panic.
Go on, Remy.
Aah!
Remy!
- Is that the last?
- Lou!
Lou!
How many more
down there?
This used to be
a hell of a town, Officer.
Yeah.
