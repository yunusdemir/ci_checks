The bosses have been distracted.
They are transporting something.
He heard about the storage warehouse.
He says he has more information,
he wants to meet me at eight.
What do you want?
Rini, if I had any other choice,
I wouldn't be here.
- Do you know this man, Karl Sieg?
- No.
Perhaps you know someone who does?
I wanted somewhere near the office
I could stay when I'm over.
Beautiful wee place called Audresselles.
Someone once told me -
guilt, it's like a cancer.
"You can treat the symptoms...
but never the cause."
I found some things out about Vincent
Bourg. He knows lan Garrett.
The two of them know each other.
What?
You mind if I clean here, please?
No, no, of course not.
It's so peaceful here.
Well, we try.
So, you find that you are happy here?
I like to make sure our guests are happy.
Madam?
- Oh.
- Voilà.
Thank you.
It's no trouble.
You're French.
Yes.
I went to Paris once.
It wasn't for me.
What brings you to Oxford?
Just someone that I used to know.
An old friend?
No, not exactly.
I don't even know he's alive any more.
But I made him a promise, many years ago.
And I intend to keep it.
Well, you don't hear that every day.
Very noble.
You're most kind, but, no.
I don't think so.
Darling?
Darling, are you...
Ah, that's all I need, huh?
Another bloody day at the office.
♪ Oh, my love
♪ We pray each day
♪ May you come home
♪ And be OK
♪ For now, we wait for you
♪ For you to come home
I don't know what you expect me to do.
Ian Garrett is a respected
local businessman.
And he's connected to Vincent Bourg.
What is your proof, a story?
The exact same story,
told the exact same way.
I'm sorry, but... it
doesn't make any sense.
This guy is helping you, he's put up a lot of
money to encourage people to come forward.
Someone I've never met turns up, throws
money at us. You've got to wonder why.
You must know...
Mr Garrett experienced
a similar tragedy to your own.
His daughter.
I'm sure he felt
an emotional connection to your case.
I'm not asking you to
go out and arrest him,
I'm just asking you and Detective Baptiste
to please look into Garrett
and see if there's any connection
between him and Vincent Bourg - that's all.
Listen, I cannot imagine
what you are both going through.
But this - this is definitely
not the way to get your son back.
Well, I...
I think at the very least,
it's worth looking into.
Even if there's the slightest chance
there could be a lead.
There is a lead.
Detective Baptiste is in Paris right now.
I'm joining him today.
What lead?
What's in Paris?
Um... it's er... too early to say.
Of course it is.
Thank you for your help. Come on.
They can't expect us to just sit back
and do nothing.
- At least have a word with Baptiste.
- Give me the car keys.
I need to speak to Vincent Bourg.
- Look, the police aren't gonna do anything.
- Have the police told you...
Look, we're both so desperate
for the slightest thing, the smallest hope,
but if you accuse lan Garrett,
he could withdraw the reward money.
Em, I swear to you, I heard what I heard.
The exact same story,
told the exact same way
by two people who claim to have
no knowledge of each other.
Please, I have to try.
For Olly.
- I'm gonna drive.
- No, no, no. I'll do this on my own.
- You should be back at the hotel.
- What, resting?
That's what everybody says. I'm
not an invalid. I'll drive.
How do you know he comes here?
He comes here every day.
Have you been following him?
Tony?
Right, I think we should go back.
- I think...
- Wait here.
Tony...
Oi!
What do you want from me?
I already told you,
I don't know what happened to your son.
- Do you know lan Garrett?
- Leave me alone!
- Do you know lan Garrett?
- I'm calling the police.
Please.
Please... I didn't do anything.
Ian Garrett's number.
- Tell me about Garrett!
- Argh!
Leon called me.
He told me he had information
about Oliver Hughes.
And, you know,
by the time I went to meet him...
So, we've run his phone records.
Shortly before calling me, Leon received
a phone call... from your brother.
Do you...
You think Martin...
- Yes.
- ..has anything to do with some missing child?
Yes.
No way.
OK.
If the caid had anything to do with this
child's disappearance, your brother will know.
You think he told Leon?
That is my hope.
All I ask is that you meet your brother and
find out what he told Leon about Oliver Hughes.
- No.
- Listen...
myself and several other officers
will be close by.
Once you've spoken with Martin, we'll get you
somewhere far from here, somewhere safe.
And then, I assure you,
I will not trouble you again.
Bourg knows him. He knows lan Garrett.
They've shared things...
material.
Oh, God.
Bourg's alibi was a lie.
Garrett paid for it.
Garrett was worried that if Bourg spent too
long in police custody, he'd start talking,
reveal who the real lan Garrett is.
- I don't understand, did Bourg take our son?
- He swears he didn't but he's terrified of Garrett.
- We need to talk to the police.
- No, I'm going to meet Garrett.
He invited me to go and watch the cup final
with him, take my mind off things.
- You're not gonna go?
- Yeah, yeah. He's coming to Châlons.
We need to be sure, we need to do these things
properly, you can't just turn up and...
And what?
And do whatever you just
did to Vincent Bourg.
What did you do to him?
Look at you, you're shaking.
- We need to talk to the police and tell them...
- Why? You heard Mark, they don't believe us.
- I'm wanna go there now.
- I need to look lan directly in the eye.
Tony, please.
I'm just gonna talk to him.
Go to the police if you want.
But I'm meeting Garrett.
So these corridors will be
just over regulation width.
Excuse me.
Hello?
It's me... Vincent.
Tony Hughes...
he knows.
I see.
He beat me.
Thanks for telling me.
You're not going to hurt her... right?
You said you wouldn't hurt my mother.
And you said you'd keep your mouth shut.
I'd rather not pay your
mother another visit.
Allez, Les Bleus!
Hey!
Saved a seat for you.
Got you a beer in, too.
Probably a bit on the warm side now.
Cheers.
Thanks for coming all this way.
This wee place is starting to grow on me.
- How's it going?
- One-one.
Zidane penalty, then Italian header.
Pretty cagey stuff.
You all right, pal?
I know what you are, Garrett.
I know your wee secret.
You shouldn't have gone
after Vincent Bourg.
You're out of your depth, sunshine.
Emily told them
you paid for Vincent Bourg's alibi.
Better give that lawyer
friend of yours a call.
No, Tony.
I don't think so.
I'm sorry, Mr Hughes,
but we need you to come to the station.
You're under arrest for assault.
- What?
- Stand up, please.
Don't be ridiculous,
it's not me you're after, it's him.
Stand up, please.
- What are you talking about?
- Please.
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Mr Hughes, stand up.
Get your hands off... Oi, get off!
It's not me, it's him you want!
I'm only trying to help you, Tony.
It's not me you want!
He knows Vincent Bourg!
Garrett knows Bourg! What are you doing
with me? He's a paedophile!
I thought you only want information.
This is for your protection.
We need to know what's going on inside.
Protection?
When we left Romania, we had nothing.
Didn't know where to go, what to do.
We only had each other.
My brother looks after me.
He will want to help me...
and I go in wearing this?
The people he works for know you were
involved with an undercover police officer.
So you will wear this.
Let's go over the story once more.
Leon told me about...
a man called... Karl Sieg...
..how he was involved
in Oliver Hughes' abduction.
And then what do you say to your brother?
Then I say I have no money.
I want to blackmail Karl Hughes...
Sieg.
- It's Karl Sieg.
- Yes.
Sorry.
I want to blackmail him,
I threaten him to go to the police.
And?
And I ask for the address...
for Karl Sieg's address.
- And I will split the money with my brother.
- That's good.
- Karl Sieg.
- Yes.
Oliver Hughes.
Remember, we are not far away.
And we have a man in the café.
Are you ready?
Très bien, merci.
Is there a problem?
- Sorry, Doctor. It's James Walsh, I'm his father.
- It's all right, there's nothing to worry about.
His ankle is broken and he'll need a cast.
A bad fall, but he'll be fine.
We've got him on some painkillers but it was
quite a shock. He's been asking for you.
Take care.
Mum.
- Where's Mum?
- She's on her way.
- You called her, right?
- Yeah, I did.
It's all right, Mum'll
be here soon, I promise.
It's OK.
It's just a fright, that's all.
You're all right now.
There must be someone else
who can help us find Karl Sieg.
No one who's talking.
So we bring her brother in ourselves.
Why would a prominent member of the caids de
cité speak to us? There is no reason to help.
Our best chance is Rini.
What we are asking her to do
is hard and it's dangerous.
We cannot compel her if she's afraid.
So what do we do?
Karl Sieg's a ghost,
there isn't a single trace left of him.
I know.
Et voilà.
Sorry. Celia loves to text.
Why we cannot simply
pick up the phone and talk escapes me.
- Is she still in Châlons?
- No.
She returned home.
Our daughter will have moved on.
Sarah, my daughter...
she's an addict.
From time to time, she returns to our home.
Sometimes she breaks in and steals.
Other times, she... she tries to...
..threaten... No, bully.
She'll bully my wife into
just giving her money.
All of this is my fault. I'm at a loss.
No. Please, no.
You can't leave now.
I'm no use to you here.
If you turn round and run away,
you're no use to anyone.
- Let us sit and talk.
- There's nothing to talk about!
Do you want to talk about this?
The police were outside last time also.
And yet I almost bled to death.
I understand how much
you want to find your son.
No, you don't. If you leave, you don't.
I'm sorry, I...
I need to go. I need to make a life.
No, no, wait, wait, wait! Listen!
- Let me go!
- You owe Julien!
Without him, you'd have no life!
- Get a hold of yourself!
- I have no life!
Please.
Fine! Go home. Enjoy your life.
Une cigarette?
- No, I'm fine, thanks.
- English?
Irish.
Something about Irish peoples' face
that just gives them away, no?
Eyebrows, maybe?
What about you?
- What do you do?
- Me?
I um...
I'm Tony. Tony Hughes.
Monique Pelletier.
I don't care what happens to me.
What's important is
Bourg admitted to me that he knows Garrett.
Emily was on her way over here
to tell Mark... Detective Walsh.
Ian Garrett paid for Bourg's alibi.
Mr Hughes, two witnesses identified
Vincent Bourg and provided an alibi.
We cannot simply ignore that
just because you say so.
All I am asking is that you take a look!
And I am sure Detective Baptiste
will consider every angle of investigation,
once he's back from Paris.
I'd like to call my wife now, please.
Sure.
- Tony?
- Hi.
Where the hell are you?
I need you to do something for me.
There's someone you need to find.
What? Who?
You need to get on a train to London.
Here?
Who is the other guy?
She said her brother would come alone.
What's he saying?
He tells her a lot of
people are looking for her.
She says, "What did you say to Leon
when you called him?"
She shouldn't be talking about
Oliver already. It's too quick.
If we pull her out of there,
we lose our last chance to find Oliver.
Julien.
Rini! Rini!
Hang on.
Georges said it was all right if I...
if I come and see you.
He's a mate, so...
I had a dog once when I was a boy.
His name was Snowy, he was a mongrel.
Even though he only had
a wee splash of white on his neck.
I was a big Tintin fan.
He was a timid thing, was Snowy.
He'd jump at his own shadow.
He was a big bastard but he was timid.
And one night, during a thunderstorm,
he got himself all riled up.
A neighbour came by, his
power had gone out.
And when I opened the door,
Snowy went for him.
He took a chunk out of his leg.
Gentlest dog in the world... I swear.
But he was scared.
He wasn't thinking.
So, he had to be put down...
..even though the poor fella
was trying to protect me.
Lashing out in your state
is only gonna get you hurt, son.
Where were you the night Olly went missing?
Working late as usual.
It's true, I promise.
All I'm doing is trying to help you.
Your daughter, Molly...
..she didn't just walk out of
the house that night, did she?
You be very careful what you say
about my Molly.
You took her, didn't you?
Cos you're sick.
I'm sorry it's come to this, Tony.
That dog of yours had to be put down
because it was a dangerous animal.
Because it might have hurt someone else.
Dangerous animals like you
need to be put down, lan.
That's as may be.
But erm...
..I'm not the one in the pound right now...
am I, sunshine?
We made up a place
where the boy was supposed to be.
And we only told Leon.
Some buildings in a
field, outside of Lille.
And a camera was placed
there to see who came.
So the call to Leon about Oliver...
..the location...
..you knew nothing of his whereabouts?
You fed my friend with
lies, to draw him out?
This was just a ploy to kill him?
We had to flush out the rat.
What about the man who ran away?
We need to speak with him.
Talk, talk!
Talk!
Do you really think I will tell you?
You have to.
After what happened to Leon?
And to my sister?
No way.
Would you like some cream? Milk?
Me neither. I have some, though,
for when guests come.
And I have some biscuits in the cupboard.
No, I'm fine, thanks.
So...
Sorry, I didn't catch your name.
Emily.
- And you're a friend of lan's?
- An acquaintance.
You haven't been reading the papers lately?
Oh, no. I find them much too upsetting.
Are you sure you wouldn't like to have
a biscuit? They'll go stale soon so...
No, I'm fine, thanks.
I wanted to talk to you
about lan, actually.
Oh, I haven't seen him in a while.
He's always away on business, you know?
He's a very busy man.
And when he's not doing a build
for other people,
he's working on our summer place
in Audresselles.
This stain just won't give.
Honestly.
I've tried everything.
I tell you what doesn't work is white wine.
That's one old wives' tale...
A week ago, my son, Oliver, went missing.
I was on holiday with my husband
and he was taken.
Oh, dear. That must be...
Goodness, how awful.
You had something similar
happen to you too, didn't you?
Yes.
Molly.
It was a long time ago.
What has any of this got to do with me?
- I'm not sure I...
- When your daughter went missing,
did they question lan?
Did they?
- Get out.
- I'm only asking if they questioned him.
Will you leave my house now, please,
Mrs Hughes?
I'm sorry, but I never told you
that Hughes was my surname, Mrs Garrett.
You know who I am, don't you?
Don't you? So why are you lying to me?
Why?
I'll see myself out.
Are you going to say anything
about Oliver's kidnapping?
Em? I'm out, finally.
I found her, like you asked.
- I spoke to Mary Garrett.
- OK?
I'm fine.
There's something not quite right,
it's like she's not all there.
I don't know think that her and lan
have even seen each other for a while.
She said that he's either
always away working
or in Audresselles
working on the summer home.
And when I asked her if lan had
ever been questioned about Molly,
she practically threw me out the door.
Like she's hiding something.
- What time's your train get in?
- Six.
I'll pick you up.
I could stare at this forever.
It won't go away, though, will it?
Wherever we go.
But we got away, didn't we?
We're together.
Just like you wanted.
It's not what I want.
I think you might've had one too many.
Maybe you need a wee lie-down.
Don't ever talk down to me.
Don't you dare.
Not after what you did.
And not just to Molly, to...
You're right, doll. You're right.
I'm sorry.
Not many wives out there
would keep a secret like you did.
But we came here... to disappear...
..to put it all behind us.
You need to start trying to let go.
We both do.
Till death us do part, right?
Aye.
Death us do part.
Where have you been?
I've been calling you.
Erm... my phone ran out of battery.
I thought you were leaving?
Thank you.
Do you think he'll believe her?
Rini's brother is a criminal, a greedy one.
Greedy men like him believe
that all around them are greedy also.
Rini, don't do this.
Yes, yes!
Karl Sieg goes by the name André Touloux.
He's in Brussels.
Good. We have what we came for.
Now put the knife down.
Don't ruin what you've
built all these years.
Hurting your brother
will never stop haunting you.
Rini?
Did he tell you?
We know where Karl Sieg is.
- You've got it wrong.
- Where is he?
Wait, it's not... it's not what you think.
Is this him on here? Is this Olly?
I wouldn't look at that,
son, if I were you.
I wouldn't look.
Oh, God.
Like I told you.
It's not him.
How many other tapes are there like this?
I don't know.
I never took your boy here.
I swear, I... I never even met him.
So you contacted me out of the blue...
..offering me money,
out of the goodness of your heart?
I've done bad things, Tony.
And um... it eats away at me.
You ever hear about
those billionaire philanthropists...
..hit the rich list
and then they decide to do their bit?
Do you think they're saints?
You think they don't do it
because of some niggling guilt...
..all the necks they've stood on
to get where they are?
You don't get to the top
without making a mess along the way.
There's no such thing as human kindness.
You're a rapist, you're a murderer...
..you're a paedophile.
Why should I believe you didn't do to my
son what you did to your own daughter?
Molly was a mistake.
I didn't...
I didn't want to...
It just... it just happened.
I'm calling the police.
You're gonna confess
everything you've done.
And then you're gonna tell them
what you've done with my son.
53.
What?
Tapes. You asked how many tapes.
53.
No.
Where are they?
It's not my fault.
My granddad...
..used to come into my bed...
..every night...
..and he would...
..he would...
..to me and my brother...
Shut up!
Where's he? Where's my son?
Where's my boy, huh?
If you want revenge, Tony...
..I'm here.
I never touched your boy, I swear.
He was beautiful, though, wasn't he?
Aargh!
There's someone here to
see you, Mrs Garrett.
It'd be nice to say hello
to them, wouldn't it?
They've come a long way.
Can she hear me?
I'm not sure.
Most of the time,
she just stares out of the window.
Occasionally she'll offer up something,
or she talks to herself.
Sweet lady.
Go on, speak to her.
I think she likes it.
Many years ago, your husband threatened the only
person in the world that really cared for me.
He told me he would take my mother's life
if I spoke.
And I swore that one day
I would get retribution for this.
And I would tell everyone he ever
loved what kind of monster he really was.
But I can see I'm too late.
Obviously, you too are
a victim of this man.
I've been so angry for so long...
..at your husband...
at the world.
Perhaps it's better simply to let go...
..not to dwell on the
choices we have made...
..whether we should have gone
this way or another...
He's a boy, you know.
That's what boys do.
Instead, we should always
go forward...
How do you spell "idiot"?
..and try not to get trapped in the past.
