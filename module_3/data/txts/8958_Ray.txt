Oof.
You wanna pull that stopper, Sandy?
I got it.
Ugh.
There we go.
Hey!
Gonna move your ass anytime soon?
Your, uh, uncle picked a dead raccoon
off the side of the road.
To keep police dogs off the scent.
Okay, so they'll stop if
they f-find the raccoon?
That's what Sandy said.
Isn't this thing deep enough?
No, it's gotta go deeper.
What, you're gettin' tired?
Hell yeah.
Huh?
This hole's huge.
Why don't you go help
Sandy in the garage?
Once you done a thing, son...
once you done a thing, it's done,
so you go ahead, get it all out now,
all the vomit, all the tears,
'cause then you're gonna
shut your mouth about it
the rest of your fucking life.
- Oh, God.
- Yo, man,
why don't you grab a
shovel, help us out?
Well, I think I'm dehydrated.
- Sandwiches?
- Oh, God, yes.
- Not for me yet, Bridge.
- Oh, thanks, Bridget.
Hey, Aunt Sandy, want a sandwich?
Ah.
Ow.
You all right, Aunt Sandy?
Fucking arthritis.
I can barely move my arm.
Hey, did you ever use a chain saw?
What?
Uh, no.
It's easy.
You just pull the cord and
let the chain do the magic.
Oh, God, I c... I can't.
- I can't.
- Okay.
I guess I'll have to go
ask one of the boys.
No, I'll do it.
- Oh, Bridget, no, no.
- I'll do it.
- Oh, please, God.
- Attagirl.
Start cleaning that bathroom.
Make yourself useful.
Is that you, Ray?
Ray?
Did you love her, Mick?
Who?
Ma.
Did you love her?
Yeah, I loved your mother
with all my heart.
Why weren't you there?
What are you talking about?
Why'd you let her die alone?
She wasn't alone, Raymond.
She had all of you.
She loved you all so much,
you in particular.
She thought you were special.
She used to read to you
every night:
Shakespeare,
uh, Russian books in English.
She thought you should be, uh,
a Mr. Straight "A"s.
Remember she said that?
She did?
Sure, she did.
How was I gonna compare to a...
to a mom like that?
I-I-I-I... I didn't know nothing
from books,
only some story that my-my father read
when he was drunk.
When I met your mother,
I, uh... I recited that story.
I memorized the end of it,
recited it to her, and
that's how I got her
to go out with me.
I recited it to you sometimes too,
help you fall asleep.
Help me fall asleep?
Sure.
Put you to bed.
You're lying to me, Mick.
What are you talking about?
You were never there.
I was there, Raymond.
Maybe not always when I shoulda,
but I w... I was there.
Ray?
Raymond.
What the fuck is going on?
Fuck.
Who did you kill?
Three cops.
Three cops?
Yeah, the motherfuckers took Bridget.
Jesus Christ.
It's all good.
We got her back.
Where is she?
In the garage.
Jesus fucking Christ.
Hey, Terry. How are you?
H-hey, Aunt Sandy.
Mick.
Mick, you gotta come with me.
Why?
They picked Bunchy up.
Oh...
The FBI lady said that
if you turn yourself in
and Bunchy testifies,
then she'll go easy.
Oh. How easy, Ter?
How easy?
How e... Fuck you.
You got him into this.
Now you get your old ass
down to the federal building
and you get him the fuck out.
Terry, Ter, it don't go like that.
I go down, turn myself in,
they'll take us both.
He's right, Terry.
Let's call Ray.
Mick, I already made the fucking deal.
Look, Ter,
if it comes to that, I'll do it.
I'll do it, no matter what.
Okay, let me just
finish all this up here
so I can start thinking straight.
Daryll, toss in that raccoon.
Look where it was printed:
Sam Winslow's New York Tribune.
Are you saying it was a publicity stunt?
It's a total fabrication.
The idea that I would hurt Judge Scholl
is a Hollywood fiction
created by a Hollywood
insider for her own gain.
Judge Scholl, do you
have anything to add?
Get out and vote.
New York needs Ed Feratti.
- Anita!
- Miss Novak.
Miss Novak, how are you feeling today?
Um, I feel pretty good,
actually. Thank you.
How are you feeling about your chances?
- I feel positive.
- That's wonderful.
And what do you think should
happen to Ed Feratti?
Well, if the allegations are true,
then he should withdraw.
You've run such a fierce campaign...
- Yeah?
- We need to talk.
I'll be with my volunteers,
where I should be.
- Where are you?
- Thank you.
Downstairs.
I'll send Vinnie.
Bridget comes from a very strong mother,
and she's strong too.
You want to be with a woman like that,
you gotta toughen up.
Hello, Ray.
Supposed to snow tonight.
Doesn't look like you stopped by
to have a drink.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry about the recording
and what happened to your daughter.
That was a horrible thing to do.
You and I have...
We've done a lot of horrible things.
Haven't we, Ray?
I want to trust you again,
and I want you
to trust me.
Do you think that's possible?
Oh, you look so tired.
Everybody wants something
from you, don't they?
What is it you want?
Tell me.
Tell me anything.
What are you doing?
I want you to wear this dress.
What?
And I want you to take a shower,
get all that blood off you.
Then I want you to put on this dress.
Why?
'Cause today we're going down
to the justice of the peace
and we're gonna get married.
Today?
Just you and me.
We'll need a witness.
- Is that a yes?
- Yes.
This is Dr. Arthur Amiot.
Please leave a detailed message,
and I'll return your call
as soon as possible.
Do you have to lay out
nude like that? It's indecent.
It's private property.
I have the right to exercise my right
to do what I want on my own property.
Well, you have the right
to do what you want,
but, you know, there are
people watching you.
You're outside.
The beach is lower than
the window, and if all...
Beach House in Malibu.
I used to watch this when
I was in high school.
I-I don't get how Mary Jane's twin
is still on the show
after they murdered her.
Her-her twin came back, but it
turned out she was her triplet.
I'm not nude either.
Technically I have this.
Or doesn't that count for anything
in your little prayer hymnal?
Technically your body,
but I have a teenage son...
Did they hurt you?
They hit me.
Did they do anything else?
No.
Yeah, you should be smoking pot
and going to concerts, not...
not burying bodies on Long Island.
If your mother was here, she...
If my mother was here,
she'd be doing exactly what I'm doing.
You look great.
Now it's your turn.
What? My turn for what?
Well, to clean up and put on a suit.
Yeah?
Check your phone.
Why?
There's an address.
What are you talking about?
Just do it.
Your mother...
your mother was the love of my life.
What?
And you...
you, kid...
you wanted me to be your father.
You actually wanted me.
Mick.
They picked up Bunchy.
Did you know that?
Yeah.
Ter made some deal with the feds:
him for me.
Don't do anything till I call you.
Pop.
- These the last two.
- Yeah.
All right.
- Hey.
- What?
Great kids come from great fucks.
One...
two...
three.
Let's get the fuck out of here.
Come on.
What number are we? Is it 86?
Did you call Ray?
No.
Well, d-d-don't you... don't
you think you should?
No.
They're on 84.
God.
Hey, do you want some water?
- No.
- No?
Do you want some water?
No?
- I'm gonna go get some water.
- Okay.
Okay.
What's wrong?
Bridget?
Did you know he tried to kill himself?
My dad?
What?
They said it's gonna be a while.
When?
I don't know.
A few months ago, he...
he jumped off a building into the river.
That cop saved his life.
What, the one from Staten Island?
Number 86?
What?
Number 86?
Hey. That's us.
Do you have a witness?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm-I'm-I'm the witness.
Follow me.
I got Ray Donovan down here.
Yeah, I don't like that.
Can I help you?
I need to see Feratti.
On the floor.
Hey! Put the gun down!
Drop it! Drop the gun!
Stop! Stop this!
Ray!
Jesus Christ, are you out
of your fucking mind?
Look, I know I fucked up.
I know that.
But I certainly had nothing
to do with your daughter.
Radulovic is clearly out
of his fucking mind.
You don't have to believe
me, but you should.
And I certainly didn't
release that tape.
That was Sam Winslow selling you out.
You know I got a family, just like you?
And I'd fucking fight and
die to keep them safe.
But if you pull that trigger,
what happens to them?
What happens to us? You dead.
The headlines... Jesus
and Mary, the headlines.
Is that what you want?
Is that what your daughter wants?
No?
No.
You got things to do, Ray.
You gotta keep your family safe,
you gotta get your
brother out of prison.
I'll tell you what.
You work with me,
I'll work with you.
We can bring all this to bygones.
Number 111!
Number 111?
Mr. Donovan!
Mr. Donovan.
I'm standing here with Ray Donovan,
the man who allegedly made the
tape of Ed Feratti's threat
toward circuit court
judge Gregory Scholl.
Mr. Donovan, how did you
come to be involved
- with Ed Feratti?
- Fuck.
Anita?
I was hired by Sam Winslow
to help out with Anita Novak's campaign.
I see. To help with security.
No, to undermine Mayor Feratti's
campaign for reelection.
Undermine him how?
Cesar Martinez was a paid plant.
The attack in Central Park was staged,
and, uh, Justine Evans was
paid for her participation.
As for the mayor, I never met the man,
and that conversation never occurred.
Mr. Donovan, what about the tape?
On the recording, the
mayor clearly states...
Yeah, the mayor clearly states
a lot of things every day.
That's how the tape was made.
I'm sorry. I have no further comment.
Mr. Donovan?
Mr. Donovan?
Cesar Martinez was a paid plant.
- The Central Park attack was staged...
- Ah, aluminum, right?
Aluminum guy.
I told you, didn't I?
As for the mayor, I never met the man.
- Cement.
- Mr. Donov...
Oh. Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.
Oh.
I never thought anyone
would come up in here.
Will you help me out with my hands?
Do you know who I am?
What?
Do you?
No.
What... Don't...
Fuck is wrong with you?
Mm!
Oh.
You're Lena.
Right?
Now, Lena...
Lena?
Lena!
We fought hard,
and we fought for the right things:
education, gun control,
public housing.
We had a lot to say, and...
You know what?
We were heard.
Yeah.
Ms. Novak just conceded.
We may not have won the popular vote...
Mr. Donovan, you there?
- But the establishment...
- Turn this down.
heard our cry, and
that is what's most...
I've been thinking I
need someone like you.
A good man to show people the light
when simple reason won't do.
I want to thank each
and every one of you
for believing in me.
There's nothing good about me.
Don't sell yourself short, Ray.
You're not a thug.
You should work for someone
who doesn't think of you as one.
And carry on,
'cause that's what New
York has always done.
Keep up the fight, New York.
Ah, one thing's for sure.
You won't forget your
fucking anniversary.
Why did the golfer change his pants?
Why?
He had a hole in one!
How do you make holy water?
You boil the hell out of it.
Two cannibals
are sitting around, eating a clown,
and one says to the other,
"Does this taste funny?"

Did Mick ever read to us?
Mick? What?
Did he... when we were kids, you know...
He ever read to you in bed?
Why the fuck you asking me that?
I don't know.
Did he?
I don't know.
Fuck, if he did, I just...
Well...
I don't remember much about being a kid.
Well...
at least you look better than
the last time I saw you.
All right.
Go right in.
We'll be there.
Come on.
You stick around,
I'll stick around.
What?
Next time you feel like
doing yourself in,
you call the person
who fucking loves you
more than anything else in the world.
Remember that.
Yeah, Bunch!
He did it! He got us out!
Thinking about you, huh?
He couldn't get us both out.
Ah.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It was James Joyce!
What?
James Joyce, The Dead, the story
I used to tell you when you were...
you were kids.
Used to know it by heart.
What are you talking about, Mick?
Raymond said that I never was there
when your mother was
putting you all to bed.
I was there.
I was fucking there.
Hey.
Hey, remember Andy O'Shea's daughter,
Andrea?
Really?
Andi with an I.
- Jesus fuck.
- I remember her.
Andy jumped the gun when he named her.
He wanted a junior.
He ended up with five boys after that.
Yeah, so Andi O'Shea with an I...
she's over the house,
'cause Bunchy finally
screwed up the nerve to ask her out.
You're really gonna do this?
She's waiting in the living room,
but Bunchy's not there, right,
'cause Bunchy's over at the mall,
and he's stealing Air
Supply's Greatest Hits
on cassette, 'cause he heard
it was good make-out music, right?
And while he's out
stealing Air Supply, Ray comes home,
and he takes Andrea up to his room.
What are you talking about?
You took Andi upstairs, not me.
No, no, it was you.
I never touched her, Ter.
No... if you say so.
It was you, Terry.
Don't blame Ray.
Fucking asshole.
Maybe you're right.
No, you're right!
"Newspapers...
were right.
The newspapers were right.
Snow was general all over Ireland.
It was falling
on every part of the dark central plain,
on the treeless hills,
falling softly
upon the Bog of Allen,
and farther westward,
softly falling
into the dark,
mutinous Shannon waves."
"It was falling, too,
upon every part
of the lonely churchyard on the hill
where Michael Furey lay buried.
It lay thickly drifted
on the crooked crosses and headstones,
on the spears of the little gate,
on the barren thorns."
"His soul
swooned slowly as he heard
the snow falling faintly
through the universe
and faintly falling
like the descent
of their last end
upon all the living
and the dead."
I was there. I was fucking there.
Hello.
Are you there?
Yeah.
Is this Mr. Donovan?
Yeah.
You called me several times, didn't you?
How've you been?
All right.
Uh-huh.
Any more episodes?
I don't know.
You don't know?
I don't know where to start.
How about tonight?
How about we just start
with the fact that you called me?
That was brave, Ray.
Y-you know, that took a lot of courage.
Why don't we just sit with that?
You there?
Yeah, I'm still here.
So what's next?
Next,
I'd like it if we could
talk together again,
in person,
but that's up to you.
What do you think? Are
you willing to do that?
- All right.
- Good.
How about... how about
Monday at three o'clock?
Sure.
Okay.
Good night, Ray.
All right.
