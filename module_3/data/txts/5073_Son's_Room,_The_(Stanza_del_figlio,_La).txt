The Son's Room
Coming.
Yes?
Yes, speaking.
Hello.
Yes.
Today?
Why? What's happened?
I'm here to see the principal.
Through there.
Thank you.
Come in!
Hello.
Hello, Mr. Sermonti.
Sorry to disturb you.
Have a seat.
Thank you.
- Hi.
- Hi, Dad.
Something very unpleasant
has happened.
A fossil has vanished
from the science lab...
a rather rare ammonite.
I wouldn't like Andrea
to be mixed up in it.
Are you talking about a theft?
Yes...
and we suspect Andrea
and his friend Luciano.
It wasn't us.
That's what Luciano says, too...
but a classmate
apparently heard them bragging
about taking the fossil.
Not true.
Sorry, but I have to suspend
Andrea and his friend
for a week.
How much do you understand
of what I'm saying?
What percentage of understanding
is there here?
20-30%?
I've spent 460 hours here.
I've spent 46 million lira.
Plus, I always treat myself
to a dress after I finish here.
They do good business
with your patients.
I've asked around.
Even the food store.
I've seen for myself.
I should tell my cousin
to open a shop here.
You always feel guilty,
responsible for what happens...
but we can't control
our lives completely.
We do what we can.
Maybe you should learn to wait
instead of always having to act.
Learn to be idle.
That doesn't mean be passive.
Just take a more relaxed
approach to life and the world.
What do you think?
I open the door onto a corridor
where lots of people are walking
towards me.
I think,
"The party's already over."
Then I open a door leading
onto a huge patio.
There's a trapdoor, some stairs,
a small door...
What a bore.
This dream's such a bore!
Trapdoors, stairs,
doors opening...
It's full of symbols
that you can spend hours on
but I don't agree with you.
I think it's
just a waste of time.
Around 180 pages.
Yes, with the photos.
I've started the introduction.
It seems pretty good.
Have you spoken to Andrea?
Excuse me.
- Yes, I spoke to him.
- He told you?
Yes, he told me. Just a second.
Giovanni just came in.
Yes.
Two weeks isn't enough.
I like playing there.
It's a good floor.
The ball makes a different sound
than in our gym.
How come?
Our floor's linoleum.
You know that.
It makes a dull sound
that doesn't really inspire you.
It's kind of sticky...
I like the sound of the ball
when it hits the racket.
Me, too. Like this...
Yes, like that.
Thanks.
What's your favorite sport,
sound-wise?
I don't know.
Ice hockey.
Come on, if he said
it wasn't him, just forget it.
All this fuss over a stone!
Over a theft, you mean.
I know what...
if he comes straight away,
it wasn't him.
Yes.
Five minutes late,
that means it was him.
15 minutes late,
it was the principal.
Maybe he even has a collection
at home.
Very funny, the principal
stealing from the school.
Here I am.
Bingo!
What's going on?
Nothing.
Here's your prize.
You've won.
Irene invented a new game
in your honor.
Going there means
admitting he did it.
No, I'm just trying to
understand what really happened.
He didn't do it. I spoke to him.
You know him,
he'd never even think of it.
A theft!
Come on, it's ridiculous.
A theft...
Let's see what happened,
what the others say.
I don't even know
what an ammonite looks like.
It's a sort of shell.
You know... spiral-shaped.
Yes.
Want me to go?
Yes, but I'd rather go myself.
Okay?
Weird houses, huh?
I don't know anyone
who lives this far out.
How do you get here?
I catch the number 24 bus.
It's a quiet area.
Yes, I know. It's just that...
I'd never been out here before.
Have they been here long?
Luciano's lived here
since I've known him.
So, what's this Filippo like?
I've never really liked him.
You saw the fossil, right?
Luciano opened the bag
and it was inside.
No way! You believe anything!
Those were sneakers
in a plastic bag!
I didn't see sneakers.
Sneakers are much bigger.
The bag was shaped
like an ammonite.
Hold on. You never mentioned
a plastic bag.
The fossil was inside!
And they were laughing.
So?
Maybe they were just joking?
No. When I wanted
to have a look, they ran off.
So, I wasn't really able to see
it.
Okay, I didn't actually see it.
Happy now?
What do you think?
Let him have a word
with his parents.
We'll go outside.
Can we use the balcony?
- Go ahead.
- Thank you. Come on.
The plastic bag, the ammonite,
the shoes...
I couldn't make heads or tails
of it.
It seems clear enough to me.
It does?
It does.
I'm really happy.
So am I, of course.
Ever met Luciano's father?
I saw him at the school once.
Why?
He was a bit aggressive.
With you?
Oh, come on...
He was hard on Filippo,
the boy who accused them.
Well, he was right.
I suppose so...
but it was embarrassing.
Filippo made it all up.
Who knows why?
He probably doesn't like Andrea.
Yes, Andrea told me that...
they don't get along.
I'm scared
of becoming a maniac...
of raping a child
and ending up in prison.
When I asked you
if I disgusted you
you said that I didn't.
I was glad.
Then, I went to see
that film you spoke about.
It was good.
I'm glad.
I'm glad you went
to see that film.
That seems very positive.
Maybe, but porn movies
are better.
But by choosing to see the film,
you've moved closer...
To fuck all!
Yesterday, I got a porn mag
and jacked off
in front of the open window!
I jacked off!
Nice and easy.
I'd taken a Valium.
I'd like to meet the genius
who invented that.
He knows how to help people!
Even sled dogs die because of
the smell of the peach trees.
They can't stand it.
Only one survives,
a white husky
but the hero kills it.
At one point, he boards
a ship full of dead bodies.
By Page 60 of the book,
they're all dead!
Oscar... I always like listening
to your stories
but shall we try and see
why you've mentioned this
today?
All these dead people?
I don't know.
There's no specific reason.
People say I'm in shape.
And what do you think?
I'm fine.
Work's going well.
I'm fine...
even if I still think about
suicide
and feel
that I may well try again.
Next time,
I might actually succeed.
How is it you can live normally,
feel good
and still consider
killing yourself?
How can that be?
<i>Ita res accendent lumina rebus.</i>
Easy: "Thus every mystery
shall be resolved."
That doesn't mean anything.
I read it badly.
"You will easily comprehend
"Everything will be enlightened
"night will no longer blind
your path
"Nature will fulfill you
and every mystery
shall be resolved."
It makes no sense.
Come on, it's crystal clear.
Oh, yeah? You think so?
So what does
"Nature will fulfill you" mean?
It's man facing the universe.
You jerk.
You've smoked too many joints.
What was that?
"You've smoked
too many joints."
- I heard right.
- Yes.
Couldn't you wait
until we finished working?
I smoke all the time,
just for the taste.
All the time.
You're not romantic:
"Man facing the universe."
We'll try working tomorrow,
okay?
Hey, chill out.
- Come on, give me a kiss.
- No, no.
Just one,
a little kiss on the cheek.
No.
Okay, I get the message.
- I'm going.
- See you.
- I'm going. Good evening.
- Good-bye.
Good-bye.
<i>Perductus...</i>
What does that derive from?
Don't ask your mother.
She never studied Latin.
<i>Perduco:</i> to drive, attract,
seduce, extend...
So...
"Without hardship,
you will be guided...
<i>...namque alid ex alio</i>
<i>clarescet nec</i>
<i>tibi caeca nox..."</i>
<i>"Clarescet"?</i>
"Indeed, all things..."
I guess Matteo was right.
"Man facing the universe."
Come on,
he made a good guess.
Lights out?
Five more minutes.
Listen to this poem.
It's called "Toes."
<i>"What in hell is going on?</i>
<i>"What kind of toes are these</i>
<i>that nothing matters</i>
<i>any longer?</i>
<i>"Are they really my toes?</i>
<i>"Have they forgotten</i>
<i>the old days?</i>
<i>"What it was like being alive?</i>
<i>"Always first on line,</i>
<i>first onto the dance floor...</i>
<i>when the music started?"</i>
Nice, isn't it?
Hello?
Anybody there?
Are you tired?
Yes.
Very tired?
Very, very tired?
This nightgown...
Does it bother you?
A little.
Hello.
- Please come in.
- Thank you.
That's a nice couch...
simple, comfortable
and elegant, in its way
but I have no intention
of lying on it.
Yes.
So, tell me everything.
Dr. Vitali, in Milan,
told me about you.
To be honest,
I've never heard of you.
You seem a bit young
four to five years younger
than me.
In my opinion, analysts
your own age are the worst.
Why do you say that?
Because you're more cynical.
For you, it's just any old job.
You're younger than me,
not as rich...
and I don't know
if you're smarter than me.
Perhaps I'm not
intelligent enough for you...
but we're not running an
intelligence contest here.
It's a whole other matter.
How long does the therapy last?
Who decides when it ends?
In general, it's something
that we understand together.
You make quite an impression.
You're so calm and serene.
Really? That's good.
That's good for both of us.
<i>My eyes are filled</i>
<i>With fountains of clear water</i>
<i>Where I'll drink</i>
<i>I seek forests for myself</i>
<i>And sunbathed valleys warmer</i>
<i>than you</i>
<i>I'm no longer staying with you</i>
<i>I look at the clouds over there</i>
<i>And when I go...</i>
<i>You'll have to smile at me</i>
<i>if you can</i>
<i>It won't be easy, you know</i>
<i>To live,</i>
<i>you have to die a little</i>
<i>Good-bye, my love, good-bye</i>
<i>The clouds are already</i>
<i>further away...</i>
There you go.
I thought it was odd.
He always ends up
getting distracted
letting his thoughts drift,
and he starts playing poorly.
Calmly...
He puts the balls out,
into the net.
Couldn't you follow a little?
You're reading the paper.
You're chatting all the time.
You know how important it is
for him.
Why aren't you competitive?
Don't you ever want to win?
You lost to Stefano on purpose.
No, I didn't play so well today.
No, you play for the fun of it,
like this.
You don't play to win.
I mean,
that's the idea behind it.
- Don't you agree?
- No.
What?
Around six... excuse me.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Just a second.
- What are you doing here?
- A surprise.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
Excuse me. Yes.
600 copies.
What's up?
They've sent our exhibition
catalogs for pulping.
What's pulping?
It's when they shred books
for recycling.
Oh, thank God!
Thank you so much.
No, we'll come over.
- They've found them?
- Yes.
And you're going
to get them back, right?
- I need to talk to Paola.
- I'd realized that.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
What's the matter?
I don't know.
Haven't you found
Andrea odd lately?
Odd? Why?
I don't know.
He lost that game on purpose.
He lost on purpose.
At his age, it's not normal
not to want to win.
In any case,
I don't find it normal.
He didn't steal that fossil.
You believe that?
Yes.
Yes. Yes.
For two days,
I did everything to perfection.
Then, in a newspaper headline,
I saw the word: <i>slow.</i>
I couldn't resist;
I had to find its opposite.
I searched the whole paper
until I found the word: <i>fast.</i>
By then, more than half an hour
had gone by.
I couldn't be at the supermarket
by 4:00 pm as I had planned.
I'd slipped up.
So, I set another date...
yesterday at midnight.
Another failure, because I drank
some water before bed
but I forgot to sterilize the
glass, so I drank dirty water.
I have to start
all over again...
set another date.
- It could be...
- Listen, Raffaella!
This is my best time of day.
I've drunk my tea.
I'm lucid. Follow me.
Soccer sneakers for dirt fields
soccer sneakers for turf fields
cycling sneakers,
basketball sneakers
tennis sneakers,
racing sneakers
volleyball shoes...
You get so bored.
Why don't you take up a sport?
You have no idea how tiring
it is to live like this.
I have a very good idea.
I know... because I'm
just as boring as you.
I'll see you on Wednesday?
I don't know if I'm sterilizing
my dishes properly.
After I've sterilized them,
they get dirty again.
So, I have to start
all over again.
I must find a better system.
Front first...
The scissorjump...
Then the Fosbury flop.
Go stronger! More push here!
What are you making?
Potato pie.
Did you do your homework?
A while ago.
Can you hand me
the bread crumbs?
Mom...
it was me who took the fossil...
me and Luciano.
We didn't want to steal it.
It was a joke.
Our teacher's obsessed
by fossils.
We wanted to see his face.
We didn't want to...
It was stupid.
So that means the boy
who accused you was right?
We'd have put it back
but it broke.
We tried to glue it back
together but it looked terrible.
I wanted to tell Dad yesterday...
we went for a walk...
but it was good to be together.
He was happy.
It was a joke, I swear.
You've never understood me.
You've never had
any real contact with me.
This is the last time I'm
coming.
<i>She's said that for five years.</i>
<i>She won't stop now.</i>
I can never understand
what you're feeling.
It's not a matter of method.
You're simply cold.
My previous analyst was
much less distant.
I got somewhere with him.
This discouragement isn't new.
Let's try to understand
what has happened
and how to move forward.
You're not even annoyed.
You know it's all over, too.
It's not your fault.
It's quite simple...
you're the wrong analyst for me.
<i>Yes, I can't do anything else</i>
<i>for her. The therapy's over.</i>
<i>What will she do?</i>
<i>Go to another therapist?</i>
<i>I couldn't do it. I've failed.</i>
<i>How much time is left?</i>
<i>One minute... In one minute,</i>
<i>it'll all be over.</i>
I feel better now.
So...
- See you on Tuesday.
- See you on Tuesday.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
What are you doing today?
- How about a movie?
- Okay.
What are you going to see?
There's that film showing
at the Alhambra.
My patients keep talking
about it.
So I feel like seeing it.
The trouble is,
they've told me everything.
I already know the characters,
the most important scenes...
and they've told me
the ending...
and I've been talking to myself
for ten minutes now.
How about a run together
this morning?
I'm meeting friends.
Friends...
Come for a run.
With Mom, too, right?
Oh, sure.
Five miles or so,
just to work up a sweat.
Come on.
- Okay?
- Okay.
Down to the harbor and back.
Then there and back...
and there and back again...
and then the whole avenue, okay?
Hello?
Hello, Oscar. How are you?
Sorry to hear that.
What's wrong?
I was supposed
to see you Tuesday.
We can schedule it for tomorrow
if you like.
Monday morning at 8:00...
Yes.
Okay.
Can I have the address again?
Okay.
I'll see you later then.
Good-bye.
What's wrong?
One of my patients isn't well.
I have to go over there.
We'll do that run
some other time.
Yes.
Why do you have to go now?
He's in a really bad way.
I don't know when I'll be back.
He lives some way out.
- Okay?
- Okay.
I'll take the car. Bye.
- Bye, kids.
- Bye.
Hey, let go!
Hello.
Thank you for coming.
Was it hard to find?
Not really.
I should have come to you
but I really feel too bad.
Please, take your jacket off.
Sorry I look so sloppy. I've
been out of it for two days.
I couldn't tell you
over the phone.
I should have waited till
Tuesday but it was too urgent.
What's wrong?
I did some tests and an X ray.
A spot showed up.
What did they tell you?
It may be lung cancer.
I've never smoked, I'm fit,
I live in the country...
I've brought you here
on a Sunday...
Don't worry about it.
You were right to call.
Yes, you're worried
but the diagnosis
hasn't been confirmed.
You must do further tests.
Yes, but I already know.
I'm sure it's a tumor.
<i>Hello, is anybody home?</i>
<i>It 's me.</i>
<i>Hello?</i>
Are you there?
Paola, I'm on my way home.
See you soon. Bye, sweetheart.
What's wrong?
Your son... had an accident.
Andrea... What happened?
They went diving.
How is he? How is he?
Luciano, what's happened?
What's happened?
How is he?
How is Andrea?!
How is Andrea?!
I'll make a few phone calls.
Okay?
It's the answering machine.
Valerio, it's Giovanni.
I wanted
to leave you a message.
I'm at the hospital...
and I wanted...
to tell you...
that...
I wanted to tell you...
I wanted to leave you
a message...
When was he born?
October 11, 19...
Good evening.
We've got the clothes.
Yes.
Fabio's brought sandwiches.
Okay.
This man has to dress Andrea.
Give him all that.
October 11?
October 11, 1983.
Good-bye, Andrea.
Good-bye.
Could you take it off
for a second?
Thank you.
Number Nine is catching up
on Number Two!
Can I come in?
Just a second.
I've brought your breakfast.
Thanks, Irene.
You shouldn't have.
I'm up. I'll be right there.
What about Dad?
He's already at work.
I'm coming.
Dad?
Dad?
Yesterday, I was happy all day
because I found your message
when I got in.
I knew that I'd be coming here.
I have nobody else to talk to.
Nothing ever happens in my life,
but here, I feel alive.
Finally, I can cry.
I could never do that before.
It makes me feel better.
It's not always like that.
I feel frustrated
after some sessions.
So, I treat myself to something
from one of the shops
downstairs...
but today, it's different.
Today, I just want to cry.
I could cry all my life.
Hello.
How are you?
Go on in.
I wanted to come to the funeral.
I'm so sorry.
I wanted to be there for you.
I'd taken three tranquilizers
so as not to cause trouble.
I brought flowers
but I couldn't do it.
I went to the usual cinema.
There was this guy.
At first,
we watched the porn movie.
Then some stroking
and I gave him a blow job.
Afterward, I wanted more.
I found a hooker on the street.
I had her, front and back.
I got home and Roberta was
already sleeping.
She's too beautiful for me.
I love her. Why don't I want
to do it with her?
It seems like you've
already given the answer.
What answer?
You feel you deserve nothing.
Whenever something good happens
to you
you get scared...
Okay, okay, screw all that!
You always come out
with the same crap!
Did you speak to Carla?
Yes.
And?
She's managing fine on her own.
Federico and Anna Saracinelli...
They're Lorenzo's parents,
a friend from school.
He came here often.
Do you remember?
Yes.
So, when do you think you'll go
back to work?
Next week.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Hello, sweetheart.
How did the training go?
Good.
The usual stuff.
Are you playing on Sunday?
Of course.
I've been talking to friends
at school...
and to Andrea's friends.
Yes...
I'd like to have a mass said.
I tried to think
of something else but...
it's the least sad thing, right?
Yes.
Okay.
Wednesday was our anniversary
and I finally spoke to him
about my obsessions.
From then on, no more dates,
no more rules to follow.
I'm through with dates.
I feel better but I'm scared
that if I fight it too much
I could become schizophrenic...
whatever that means...
but it could happen.
In my opinion,
there's no danger of that.
It's only natural
to feel this anxiety.
This is a great challenge
for you.
I wouldn't stop right now.
Hello.
This one's more expensive.
Take your time.
Excuse me.
This model arrived
two days ago.
What's its running time,
its duration?
It depends.
Are you a diver?
No, I just wanted
some information.
Is there something on the tank
to measure the air in it?
- Yes, the pressure gauge.
- Can I see it?
It's connected to a tube that's
attached to the regulator.
And the regulator?
Yes.
This is it.
Is a pressure gauge precise?
I'd say so.
What's this red area?
It's like in a car.
At 200 atmospheres, it's full.
When it gets down to 50,
you're using the reserve.
- And you have to come back up.
- It's better to.
An experienced diver can
stay down another ten minutes
but it's best to come up.
Of course.
So...
want to go for a run?
Then I had a CAT scan.
It's just as I thought:
I have a tumor.
I've started chemotherapy.
I have to go every two weeks...
at the outpatient clinic
but maybe you want to know
how I feel about it?
Yes, how do you feel?
I'm scared.
Before, I could only think
of dying...
and now I wonder
if I'm going to survive.
I don't have the heart
to tell my mother.
The idea of losing a son
would be too much for her.
What an idiot, saying
something like that to you!
It's all right, continue.
- Forgive me.
- Don't worry about it.
...there and back
and then the whole avenue...
Hello?
Hello, Oscar. How are you?
Sorry to hear that.
<i>I understand. I'm sorry.</i>
<i>We can schedule it</i>
<i>for tomorrow.</i>
Tomorrow morning at 8:00,
if you like.
Today?
No, I really can't today.
See you tomorrow at 8:00.
Okay. Good-bye.
I spoke to Mom this morning.
How is she?
She wanted to come
and help us out.
When?
I told her not to come...
and she started crying...
- You want to go home?
- Why?
We said it would do us good
to get our minds off things.
Good evening. Ready to order?
What do you have to start?
Barley soup,
linguine with scampi
or tagliatelle
with mushrooms.
What'll you have?
The linguine.
Me too.
- The main course later?
- Yes.
I went to a scuba diving store
and spoke to the salesman.
Andrea's gear
could have been defective.
Why did you go?
The regulator could have jammed,
so he took the tank off.
It's a tiny part.
One inch of rubber,
and everything depends on it!
The air couldn't get through!
It worked... they told us that.
Where's his tank, then?
The gear was working!
Andrea went into a cave
and he got lost.
He ran out of air while he was
looking for the exit
and he took off the tank
to come back up faster.
Andrea, alone in a cave...
it doesn't make sense.
What about his torn hands
and nails?
It makes no sense
but it happened!
What are you clapping for?
That was a foul!
Blow that whistle!
No foul!
How is she?
Okay, I think.
- What are they going to do?
- Who?
Will they suspend her
from the championship?
They already did,
during the game.
She's going to be disqualified
for three or four games.
Should I talk to her?
Okay.
You don't want to talk?
Nothing.
She doesn't want to talk.
We are not the ones
who set life's appointments
but those who remain
especially the parents and
family, ask themselves: Why?
There is only one answer.
God has set this appointment
even if we do not know why.
All we can do is use our faith
to deal
with something that surpasses
our understanding.
The Bible says:
"If the master knew
when the thief will come
he would not be robbed."
In the same way, we do not
know when the Lord will call us.
The body of Christ.
The body of Christ.
The body of Christ.
The body of Christ.
The body of Christ.
The body of Christ.
The body of Christ.
The body of Christ.
The body of Christ.
Look at this cup: It's chipped.
The cup's chipped.
This vase is cracked:
Let's turn it round.
Everything's chipped
and damaged in this house.
Everything's scratched,
everything's broken!
"If the master knew
when the thief will come
he would not be robbed."
The thief, the master...
What kind of shit sentence
is that?
It's just a sentence.
Does it matter?
What is it? What is it?
What the hell does it mean?
What is it?
What does it matter?
Look at this ashtray.
It's chipped.
Let's hide it. Gone!
My favorite teapot.
We broke it,
then glued it back together.
We did a good job.
You can't tell.
You can't tell that it's broken
but even this is... broken!
After the treatment, I don't
feel well, but I'm pretty calm.
Besides, it depends on our
attitude in relation to illness.
You mustn't give in, right?
They often say that the
patient's psychological attitude
is fundamental in curing
illness.
- Do you agree with that?
- No.
I don't agree.
Serious illnesses can be cured
even if you're passive
even if you don't want to live
but if it has to end badly,
it'll end badly
even if the patient reacts well
and tries to fight back...
even if the patient wants
to live at any cost.
That's what I think.
I wish I could have apologized
but I couldn't.
I keep thinking of that Sunday
when I went to his place.
I can't go on seeing him.
I'll always associate him
with Andrea's death.
You should tell him
what you feel.
Tell him about your problems.
Tell him...
Tell him everything's a mess
because of me.
What would become
of his analysis?
And I don't feel I have to
tell him what's happening to me.
It's not right.
Yes, but I think it's vital
in this case.
Hi.
Hi. What are you doing here?
I felt like coming to pick you
up.
Why didn't you leave
with the others?
I want to score ten baskets
in a row first.
Ten in a row!
I guess it's not my day.
Did Mom send you?
Mom? Why?
You're not starting
to worry about me now?
As soon as I come
into the room
you change the subjects.
You act casual.
Why do you say that?
Matteo and I have split up.
What happened?
I left him.
He'd never have had
the nerve to.
You don't see each other?
No, only at school.
He walked me home once
but I don't want that...
it makes me uncomfortable.
But he cares about you.
No, he feels obliged.
I'm sorry,
but I really don't miss him.
<i>Dear Andrea...</i>
<i>My letter won't be</i>
<i>as beautiful as yours.</i>
<i>I went to the library</i>
<i>and I read lots of love letters</i>
<i>by famous women</i>
<i>hoping to copy some</i>
<i>but those writers don't love</i>
<i>you as much as I do.</i>
<i>So, I'd rather use</i>
<i>my own words.</i>
<i>They'll soon be calling me</i>
<i>to dinner</i>
<i>but I want</i>
<i>to finish this first.</i>
<i>I keep on thinking about last</i>
<i>summer and that day we met.</i>
Remember meeting him at the
station after that camping trip?
How come I didn't notice?
- We didn't notice anything odd.
- Should we have?
Maybe it wasn't important.
He never mentioned it.
What did he ever mention?
Here:
"We only saw each other
for one day
but that was enough for me
to understand..."
Just one day!
Yes, I know, I read it but...
if that's the way she writes
about Andrea...
For instance,
at one point she says
that he seems shy,
but that in fact he isn't...
that when he's silent,
you don't feel awkward.
Yes, that's right.
Is there an address?
On the back of the envelope.
I'll get her number
from information.
Maybe it would be better
to write.
Why?
Because we have to tell her.
She doesn't know.
She doesn't know about Andrea.
<i>It happened</i>
<i>less than a month ago.</i>
<i>It was a Sunday.</i>
<i>Dear Arianna...</i>
<i>This is Andrea 's father</i>
<i>writing to you.</i>
<i>I have to give you some bad...</i>
<i>Dear Arianna...</i>
How about stopping now?
Tired already?
My friends are waiting for me
to go diving.
They're waiting?
Yes.
Let's stay together, okay?
You can go next Sunday, okay?
- Okay.
- Come on.
Faster!
You always find an excuse
for me.
Always.
No one's ever guilty with you.
Whatever I do,
you always find some excuse...
but there's always a price
to pay.
How can one refuse to pay it?
Let me see.
That's cute. You look good in
it.
Yes, I like the colors.
It suits your complexion.
Was the green one better?
It's different.
Both of them are nice.
Why don't we take both?
Let me try the other one on
again.
The office is close to home.
So, I don't use the car anymore.
Too bad. It was the only time
when I would listen
to the radio.
Did Giovanni tell you
what happened?
A strange but beautiful thing.
Andrea had a girlfriend.
We didn't know.
She wrote a letter to him and...
They met on a camping trip
a few weeks before Andrea...
She was about to leave
and he'd just arrived.
Her name's Arianna.
Arianna is...
I want to meet her.
She remembers everything
about that day, even his clothes
and the song that was playing
in the bar.
I can picture her, maybe
because of what she writes.
I want to meet her.
Why did you try
to shut me up earlier?
I didn't, not at all.
It's not as if
they were embarrassed.
I know that.
I simply took your hand
to be close to you.
No, you wanted me
to stop talking about Andrea.
You think talking to others
means losing something.
Yes.
I pity you.
Okay.
I met my husband
when I was 24.
He was a career soldier.
After our wedding,
we moved to Rome.
We lived at the barracks.
Our whole neighborhood was
the barracks.
We'd only go into the city
on Sundays, in our best clothes.
Sometimes, the wife of one
of my husband's colleagues
would visit.
She'd ask me:
"Thinking about children yet?"
I love children,
but we could never have any.
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
"...and, that evening,
Paola said
that you're
the only person who..."
I'm going to bed.
How about you?
I'm coming.
No, I haven't written
that letter to Arianna yet.
I figured as much.
- What if I'd stayed that day?
- Is that a question?
If I hadn't rushed over to
that patient's like an idiot...
if I'd stayed...
He'd have gone anyway.
If I'd taken him running
we'd have had an ice cream, we'd
have seen a movie...
Giovanni, please!
You can't turn back time.
That's exactly what I want to
do: Turn back time.
Of course, only you matter.
You don't care about Andrea.
You haven't even written to her.
I've tried to write to her.
I can't do it.
I think that maybe...
I don't care what you think.
I don't want to listen anymore.
That's enough, thanks.
Thanks.
How are you?
So-so.
Hello, could I speak to Arianna,
please?
Arianna?
This is Andrea's mother,
Andrea Sermonti.
Andrea had an accident,
in the sea.
He's dead.
Arianna...
it was a blood clot.
I can call you back later.
We'd be very happy to meet you.
Yes, I know you have school,
but we could come there.
Why not?
We'll let a little time go by.
Take a few days
to think it over...
I understand.
I'm sorry you feel that way,
but if that's what you want...
Good-bye, Arianna. Good-bye.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
I'll sit here today.
Fine.
How are you?
How's your family?
My family?
Of course, how's my family?
I've been seeing you
for a year and a half.
You've talked about 200 books,
music, football.
Why do you change the subject?
Why do you avoid
your problems?
- That's not what I'm doing.
- It isn't?
Not these last few weeks,
anyhow.
I just want to chat a little
because I like you.
Sorry, but I won't be
coming again.
You won't be coming again.
You're not very original,
you know.
There's always a moment
when the patient says:
"I'm not coming back.
It's not doing anything anyway."
No, it's helped me.
It's helped me a lot...
but my illness
has changed things.
I have to get better.
I have to concentrate on that.
I didn't even want
to come today.
I wanted to call you or write
but I thought it's better
to say good-bye in person
and to say thank you
for everything.
Take care.
Some patients I don't listen to.
With others, I get too involved.
It's as if I was in their shoes.
I'm probably not helping them
much right now.
Maybe you went back too soon.
It's not that.
I no longer have any
objectivity.
Have you spoken to someone?
To Enrico.
What did he say?
Not to rush to a decision,
to wait.
- So do that.
- Waiting won't do anything.
Besides, my mind's made up.
I'm relieved,
even if it's not nice to say it.
It's better this way for
everyone.
What about us?
What will we do?
I don't know.
Are things that bad?
Let's not talk about it now.
No.
Good night.
I wasn't expecting this at all.
I'm really sorry.
May I ask why?
Of course you may.
A lot of things have happened,
and...
my son...
I'm not up to it anymore.
It's simple.
I can't do this work anymore.
If you like, I can refer you
to another analyst
to continue your therapy...
No, I want to try to do without.
When will you return to work?
I don't know if I ever will.
I'll wait for you.
It'll be my next date.
What the fuck is this?!
First you lure me in
I tell you everything
and then it's good-bye!
Fuck you! Fuck you!
I feel like shit, goddamn it,
and it gets worse and worse!
Bastard, asshole!
You've screwed me!
You'll pay for this!
I'm not well, asshole!
I'm not well!
I'm sorry.
I'm truly sorry.
Hello. How are you?
Well, and you?
I want to buy a gift
for one of my son's friends.
You remember my son?
Very well. He came here often.
I don't want to get it wrong.
You have a better idea than I do
of the music that a boy
of his age would like.
Let me see.
I've taken a look around
but I don't know what to choose.
Ah, yes, here we are.
This isn't a new release, but
it's so good, he should like it.
Is there a translation
of the lyrics?
No.
My son used to make fun of me.
He said I had a hearing problem:
I only listen to Italian music.
It's for him, actually.
I wanted to buy him a present.
Would you like to hear it?
Yes.
Good evening.
I'm Arianna...
Andrea's friend.
Are you his father?
Yes.
May I come in?
Of course.
I tried calling,
but there was no reply.
I'd like to say hello
to your wife
because she called me, and...
I'm afraid Paola isn't here
right now...
Hello. I didn't even
say hello properly.
She should be back soon.
A drop more?
No, thank you.
Are you sure?
Yes.
Paola won't be long.
We can call her if you like.
No, that's okay.
Okay.
Forgive me for asking
to see Andrea's room.
It really meant a lot to me.
I know.
I already had an idea
of what it was like.
Andrea's room?
I have some photos he took
with a timer.
You have them with you?
Yes.
- He took them?
- Yes.
He wanted to show me his room.
This is a funny one, huh?
Hi.
That girl's in there.
What girl?
Arianna.
Andrea's friend.
Why is she here?
She's in town
and came to say hello.
She's been waiting for you.
But, I...
She's in there.
I'm sorry about that phone call.
I didn't know and when you
told me about Andrea...
Don't worry.
Arianna.
I imagined her differently,
right?
I don't know.
Prettier?
No, just different...
the voice on the phone, maybe.
My hair used to be much longer.
Mom said it looked better.
- Tired?
- No.
You want to take a shower?
Shall we go out or eat in?
I have to be going soon.
You can sleep here if you like.
Well, actually, I have a friend
waiting for me downstairs.
We're hitchhiking together.
What about your parents?
Dad's against it.
Mom just asked me
to call every evening.
I've never hitchhiked before.
Stefano says that we can be
in France by tomorrow.
Well, if Stefano says so...
- Good-bye.
- Have a good trip.
Good-bye. Thank you.
I'd like to see you again
sometime.
Yes, me too.
Good-bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Good-bye.
- Bye.
This service area looks bigger.
You'll probably find someone.
What time is it?
It's not that late.
We'll take you
to the Genoa exit.
Oh, no...
It'll help, right?
Well, yes...
Thank you.
Yes, it'll help.
- But...
- Yes, that was it...
but look how they're sleeping.
We can't wake them now.
They're sleeping so well.
We're almost there.
Don't fall asleep too, okay.
Let's keep each other awake.
Where the fuck are we?
Where've you brought me?
Good morning!
I've got training tonight.
I'm playing again on Sunday!
What's so funny?
What's so funny?
She's nice, huh?
He is too, or isn't he?
Yes, he is, too.
He's sweet.
They go to the same school,
but he looks a bit older.
Yes, Arianna is two years
behind him.
Paola...
do you think
they're going out together?
No, don't say anything.
Don't say anything.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, and thank you.
Thanks for everything.
I'll write when we get there.
Have a good trip.
- Bye.
- Bye.
