Where the objects it .. Hmm, okay.
We will put it over there.
Eh, map, maps, maps...
Finny? Did you take the map?
And where the bottle?
Oh, this is it. Forget it!
Ooh, you should not forget this.
Finny?
Where is the child?
Dad, Dad!
Something great has happened, Dad!
Today I really make friends!
We boarded a cactus, and
throw rocks into the canyon so deep,
we could not even hear the stone landed
!
It was fun!
Tomorrow we ..
Are you listening, Father?
A .. I'm sorry, Finny.
No, not anymore!
You've just completed the new house!
I recently met up with friends!
Today is it is different.
All animals in the world have called for a meeting
.
Well, I live here!
No, listen.
There is a flood that will come, Finny.
- We'll sink if we do not go.
- Hmph.
Water? Here?
That is why you are most unsatisfactory
!
Always just about the weather, or
noisy neighbors, or birds defecate in ..
foyer.
I know how you feel, Finny,
but keeping you safe is my job.

It seems so.
Come on.
Perjalan we will be very long.
We will find our place.
What we've got there?
<Font color = "# fbb004"> Thanks!
I lost ark .. </ font>
- Wow!
- Wow!
I think this is it.
Looks like a flood coming.
Calm down, Finny.
They will not make us come
so far without some sort of plan!
Right?
Ah. A good place.
- Hey.
- Calm down, please!
Quiet!
Look, the king of the beasts!
Ah, look at this fella, Finny.
Everything will be fine.
I'm afraid I have bad news.
Aah, I knew it!
Dad, everything is being looked at.
But it gives me great hope to see you guys
unite.
Carnivore carnivorous
And herbivore vegetarian.
Together we will make
defense against future events.
You may have noticed lately
eventually became erratic weather.
Maybe you will wonder at
yourself what will happen next.
A flood!
So tremendous that will cover the earth, engulfing and destroying
everything that was in its path!
- Oh, no!
- There will be no survivors.
Hey, sir, whether
boat-shaped object that is behind it?
Oh, yes, yes.
I was going to get to that point.
No one will ever be saved
if it were not for a very pleasant man who dipangggil
Noah.
- Noah?
- He was building a huge ark
a ship to make us,
animals remain safe until the flood passes.
I told you they had a plan.
Maybe I should have started it.
Well, I, king of the animals, has been appointed as captain
ark by Noah himself.
He assigned me to take care of all the affairs of the animals.
So, Noah has some rules.
First of all, there is a ban
for carnivores eat herbivores.
What ?!
I think should likewise!
Seems he was quite serious about it, sad.
Hey, let them go! Uh, sorry!
Yes?
Is the ban starts now,
or when we boarded the ship?
Ban starts now.
Listen? I told you.
And?
Oh, ouch!
And, finally, all the animals in the ark accepted
!
Hooray!
As long as you are in the list of Noah.
- What did he say?
- See you tomorrow at registration.
List? What list?
Ma hs un <i> ma x</i>

Hey.
Hello, I'm Dave.
I was a Nestrian.
Nestrian?
It makes me curious.
Where do you come from?
Ah, uh, actually, sir, we
do not really know!
We like exploring the world for
looking for a place to live.
Wait a minute. Are not you the fellow
which emits blue gas horrible
- when you feel fear?
- Oh, you've heard of us?
- I'm sure we would have a great trip!
- I'm sorry, next.
What? No, it certainly
is a mistake!
If you're not in
the list, you do not exist in the ark.
Now, please.
Do not evict us!
We can be very beneficial for you.
It is a long journey, right?
We can make things became
good and comfortable for you all!
Nestrians is a great home maker!
Even I could make
place like this looks good.
- Margaret lived here. - I thought we had enough
a waste of time.
No, you can not do this!
You're not going to let that
very sensitive, cave dwellers,
administration, crazy woman named "Margaret"
tells us what to do!
Right?
We're all men here, huh?
- I'm Margaret.
- Aah!
Aah!
Get out of here!
Thankfully we were in the ark!
Oh, hey, Dad!
Hey.
Leah?
- Nah.
- Now what?
We are Grymp.
Aah! Geez.
Of course we climbed into the ark.
- Hurray!
- Aah!
What are you doing?
Oh, sorry, Mom. I forgot myself.
You, young lady, a lot to learn about being a Grymp
.
- Now, come on.
- Yes ma'am.
So, Dad, what were the results?
It does not get better!
Really? Extraordinary!
- We'll be in the ark! Hooray!
- Uh, come on, son. Come on.
What were you seen the cats
black that looks cool is that?
I think they called Grymp, right?
Maybe we will meet them again in the ark?
Do you think all the animals in the world
will be there with us?
Uh, well, that is a pretty big ship
, you know.
Hm, can you give me the rope?
Oh, of course.
And whether there will be no bears and elephants?
Yes.
Door, please?
That would be so awesome!
Yes, of course.
Uh, dad?
Uh, you know, this place turns into a pretty good
.
Almost embarrassed to go, is not it?
- What are you talking about ..
- I mean, we could stay here if you like
- Maybe this time you can make ..
- Dad, we do not go into the ark, right?
I'm sorry, Finny,
we are not in the list.
Ah, I knew they were going to throw us
!
Nestrian!
- We just do not match it.
- Do not say that!
I'll find a home for us.
A place where you will make friendships
.
Finny, look at me.
I'll put us in the ark, okay?
You're serious about that?
I promise you.
Please, your attention.
Do not forget to show your ticket
naikmu listed on the feet or nails.
Thank you.
Okay, straight ahead.
Enjoy your trip.
- Welcome to the ark!
- Wait.
Uh-Zebra Zebra...
Level 2, cabin 743.
Hopefully a good trip!
- Next!
- Certain.
Hey, do not bypass the queue!
Sorry, comrades, we are in a hurry.
It griffin. Check the list,
if you can read.
Help!
Get me!
Smell
mouth is killing me! Get me out of here!
Hey, spit him
out! You know the rules!
Can
to once you control yourself?
I did not come here directly
from Kansas to be eaten!
Oh, you look so good.
You scram before things get ugly.
No offense, mate. But...
You are gorillas. Things have become ugly.
You asked for it.
You really think this will work?
We will go into the ark.
You'll see.
Please do not leave your luggage unattended
or it may be eaten.
Do you think we
only Gymps on board?
Why do you ask?
I just thought it might be nice to have some herd
...
Flock? Grymps not have a flock.
The only way to survive was to keep
ourselves.
How many times do I have to...
Hey, nice spotlight!
Do you mind that you do with it?
Grymps going through!
Uh-oh.
Is this a joke?
Unfortunately, that's where you are!
Why the rush?
You really think you're going to run away with
this?
Do not be too hard...
Pretty good, huh?
- You think I look like that?
- It was his idea!
I'll tell the guards
what you are trying to do.
- Good day to you, sir.
- Do not touch me.
- We are Grymps.
- He is a liar!
Oh, geez.
Um... Uh-huh.
Okay, go.
Do not believe a word you say this creature.
Hey, go talk about your family
in your cabin.
- He is not my husband! -
You are not the only ones who want to climb aboard
- But I...
- One more word and you're down!
Next!
To this direction, Mr. and Mrs. Grymp.
See?
I told you we'll go up to the ark.
Yes!
Good morning, gentlemen and ladies.
This is your captain speaking.
Please go to the cabin you
the time we finish the loading process.
Time we will sail
about 4O 4O day and night.
We expect some choppy seas and a light drizzle.
Thank you.
Hey, get out! This is our cabin!
Want to pass.
Check this out!
A view of the ocean!
And I also remind you that this is a cruise
non-carnivores.
Thank you for your understanding.
I really could take
giraffe now...
Captain, you're still on the air!
Whoops!
Thank you for playing together.
You have saved our lives.
Grymps not save lives.
We take lives.
I love you.
I offer you a luxury cabin.
Includes exclusive ocean view and king size Haycock
for your family is captivating.
It's not my husband!
Throw him out of this ark!
Come on, dear.
We'll soon make this place like home.
Uh...
If I'm frank, you
both are charming couple.
- You want to go?
- None of your business.
Cool, let me join!
Hey, I Finny.
You know, I'm sure everyone
think we are brothers.
I'm not looking for a little brother.
What? No!
You will be a little brother.
And I will be...
Hey.
What are we doing here?
I want to see the flood
with my own eyes.
<i>Hmm?</i>
You might hurt someone!
"You might hurt someone."
Running back to my father if you fear.
For your own safety, please do not leave
cabin while you cruise.
Thank you for your cooperation.
I knew there was no flooding.
I do not think we allowed up here.
- Where your taste adventure?
- Huh?
- It does not look like you have a taste adventure
. - Of course I do!
Hey!
You kids are not allowed up here!
Phew, it's...
Hmm, where have they gone?
Enter your tail!
Ah, sorry.
Aah!
Hey, stop!
Come back here!
You kids are in big trouble!
Maybe if we start crying, she will feel bad
and deliver us.
You can do whatever you want
. I was a Grymp.
We showed no fear.
You do not scare me!
Yes, you better run!
Wow, it was amazing!
Did you see his face?
Yes! Like that!
Flood!
What should we do?
What should we do? ..
Relax, we were in the ark!
True, this is the ark.
What am I worried about?
- This is not the ark.
- What?
This is not an ark!
Leah, went inside.
Wow!
Defense, Finny!
Finny?
Oh, no! Ark!
Hey, stop!
Stop!
- Do not go without us!
- Wait!
Wait!
Hey!
Wait!
Do not... stop...
- Hey!
- Hey!
Not!
Do not go without us!
Not!
- You can swim, right? -
I do not know, has never been in the water!
Time to find out!
Aah...
Huh?
See, they bring us back to the ark
!
Thank you for helping us!
Thank you again!
Hey, hey, do not! What are you doing? This is the wrong direction!
They certainly do not help us!
We helped ourselves
for a snack while flying!
You are next!
Oh no, do not tell me you
abdominal pain again.
What the hell was that?
How many times I have to tell you:
eat slowly!
Oh, but I'm very hungry!
Great,
they are the only food left!
Whatever you do, it works.
Dad, Dad!
Dad!
Oh, no! They go without us!
What will we do?
Flood, it will soon be here!
I do not know about you,
but I will keep running.
Children?
Children what?
Leah!
Finny?
Oh!
- Where is my daughter?
- Ack!
- Thank you, comrades.
- Do not worry.
Leah?
Finny?
Uh-huh, uh-huh?
No, he did not!
Ugh, if he knows where
the kids or not?
Shh!
No
- Finny?
- Leah!
Finny?
- Finny?
- Leah?
- Finny!
- Leah!
Finny!
Where are you?
... You may not know this...
But vague... is
Nestrian privileges.
Father and I... Just not
could be seen sitting quietly.
Although
... That's all I wanted to do today.
I think we are pretty high.
We must make protection for tonight.
What's up with the problem of "we" is?
I told you to get out alone.
I was a Grymp.
We are a loner.
Are you sure?
Nestrian is great herd.
And we built a pretty good protection.
Forget it, we make our own
protection and go towards
separately in the morning.
Ugh!
<Font color = "# 8080c0"> ma hs un <i> m ax </i> </ font>
Ugh...
Huh?
(Welcome)
Oh, please.
Wait a minute!
I am taking a bath!
Hmm... Oh, hi!
Glad you stopped by!
You... Shine.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, right.
It happens in darkness. Useful when...
bad idea. Light attracts enemies.
Can you turn it off?
No, but come on in.
We're safe here, um...?
Leah.
I Finny.
Do I tell Nestrian
are followers of that great?
Someone seems she needs a hug!
Do not even think about it.
You like?
Really futile attempts
only for one night, ha!
No, it's nothing.
I could build a house whenever I want.
Moreover
Nestrian not settle in one place for a long time.
That's weird.
Dad says we have to "find our place
" or whatever.
What really hard when you want to...
You know... Friend.
I will settle here tonight, but that's it.
Tomorrow morning, I went
from here. Alone.
I think the lion was indeed true
about the flood.
Yes.
Safe  But we're here for tonight.
And our parents will surely come
and pick us up in the morning.
I wonder if my mother
know if I disappeared.
Of course he knew!
But my father, he must
very worried about me.
Oh, I do not remember if I eat it.
I've been telling her millions
times to not go out of my hand!
May .. oh, I have a bad feeling about this
- What? - I'm sure
I have found your children.
I had expected!
Come on come on now, hurry up.
That's not our children!
- Are you really sure?
- Of course we are sure!
They are the hippos!
Do we look like a hippopotamus?
Well ..
- Yes.
- What?
I did not climb to the top of this boat for contempt!
Do you know what could be done a Grymp
when he is angry?
Uh, I think I'm going to throw up again.
Go there, you base
stowaway!
This is a mistake!
What exactly is the problem?
It should be important.
I'm about to finish my horse
haircut.
Finally, there is someone who can understand!
Captain, you have to rotate the direction of the ship.
I'm in charge here,
and I'm not going to turn around this ship
to anyone!
But the captain
Brackets the stowaway this.
I will take care of them later.
What, no,
I'm not a stowaway!
He had been dragged into this situation!
Now you and your lover can think of it, hmm?
Not!
Our children were drowned out there.
And we locked in here.
It all is one mu.
I'm worried about the boy child together with your self.
But if we want to get out of this place
, we have to work together.
You should quickly think of a
way to get out of this place.
Because I'm getting hungry.
What is...?
Where is the forest?
What are you doing?
I was assembling my own boat!
Now I know what you're thinking.
Where's bed, is not it?
How do I get to sleep ..
comfortably?
It was very nice.
You see, and you think you're
would be better off without me.
Ups.
Oh, crying will not help.
I was not crying!
Well, you must have been crying.
Wait a minute, if you're not
crying, what's that noise?
Evil beast has returned!
We have to get out of here!
There is no land!
Hey, look helpless creature!
Easy prey in the can, is not it?
Leah!
I can not!
0h!
Whoa!
Torn prey to it!
- Aah!
- Get away from me!
Oh, I hate Grymp!
Whoa, whoa!
Whoa!
Hi!
- You ready?
- No.
Thank you, Leah, that was ..
No more playing around!
Yes, it's time for breakfast.
Ah .. chuu!
You never felt so sorry.
It was unbearable when someone tickles my nostrils.
God bless you.
Thank you.
Oh, oh, the water, already here!
It ..
It was even worse than I expected!
Ara it?
A giant turtle?
I do not know, but it helps them.
Looks like we have to come up with ..
Something else.
Thank you for helping us.
I Finny.
And this is Leah.
Eh, he ..
She animals that did not talk much.
My name is Obesey.
Are you talking
on your own self again?
- Hmm?
- Hey.
Hi!
Why are you
no children will be above the boat?
Do you have at kick too?
It was he who had been in the kick, not me.
Offerings we are also on board was not accepted
Hey, it's about your own self, but bird Flamingo
it has disrupted my work
I'm sorry about him.
Making himself stuck in my two
years ago and he did not want to go.
Name is Stayput.
I was his best friend Obesey.
You're so annoying.
We joke like this all the time.
Now I have to share my last moments with the rear seats
were always raving.
Hmm ..
Hey, why do not you come with us?
What?
Oh, you're so kind, but I'm afraid
we will just slow you guys.
Shut up, fool! Heh, do not listen to him!
We would love to go with you!
But where the real direction of your destination?
Hmm ..
Go to the top of the hill.
Moving away from the floods.
A good idea!
Look at him.
<i>Hmm?</i>
How can he go up there?
Come on, Leah,
they have saved us.
We can not leave them
just here to drown.
Oh, well,
but they are your responsibility!
Welcome to join in this team!
Really?
We could go with you?
Good!
Take a look at how the situation improved when I speak?
Let's go!
Oh, I do not believe this.
Frog
fat will fall like a ton of bricks! Ha ha!
Do you hear that sound?
What?
It .. deadly silence.
What did you expect?
Only we are left.
Not only do we have left.
Calm down.
We are a team now.
We are safe.
Well, then we do not have to worry
anything, is not it?
True!
Head leads up there, animal fat!
Let's keep moving!
0h!
It was really cool when you
decided to come with us.
We are all heading in the same direction.
What choice do I have?
Come on, you have to admit it.
We make a great team.
Stop calling us are a team!
Oh, you're absolutely right.
We really need the name of a team.
Argh!
What if we give the name of the runner flooding?
Or Four knights conquering fear?
Or Teachers mountains!
Close your mouth!
Oh, no, I'm not going to
do that if I were you.
We are at the bottom of the waterway.
Let's think for a moment.
If we want to get out of here, we
requires a good plan.
Hmm ..
Oh, that's it!
Okay! Okay, okay!
So, we are here, in this prison.
Where is the captain?
True, being at the top of the ship!
So we will ask the guards to let us
..
Then we go through this corridor ..
Go to the top of BOAT.
We explained to the captain ..
He will reverse the direction of the ship "
and we will get our children!
(Welcome)
No, no one can explain
on the the guard or the lion.
- Oh.
- I have a real plan.
I'm going against the guards.
Feel it!
And then I'll beat the captain.
= = Oh, well, a very good plan.
But do you forget us
still trapped in here?
Shit.
How do we get out of here?
Ah, do not you earlier
saying you hungry?
<Font color = "# 808080"> ma hs un <i> ma x </i> </ font>
You come back here!
Aah, somebody come in here!
<i>Hmm?</i>
Oh, my God.
Huh?
Oh, hey, is not allowed to hunt on the boat.
What is the point of this stupid creature
are in this safe space that cell.
I'm sorry, sir, it certainly
other animals do it on this ship ..
Hey! You can not ..
Wow, that was almost alone!
A little .. a little bit too excited for my taste.
Your plan goes well.
You make a good bait.
Oh, really?
Hey, let me out!
Which road? We do not have much time.
I do not like being in here ..
Uh, let me think.
I would become good friends
you if you get me!
Eh .. through here?
<i>Hmm?</i>
0- ow!
Someone is coming! Aah!
Get me!
Oh, no.
What the hell is this...?
Oh, hey, friends,
come on, get me out!
Please, I beg you, let me out!
You can not do this!
Thank you!
What has happened?
Stowaway, they fled.
They have cheated me,
and I do not see it.
He pretended that he was hunting
,
then I went to stop him,
and I said, "Hey,
No hunting allowed on the boat!"
I suspect they will make trouble.
Have not you anything, dear?
I'm alright.
If I can get them ..
They will pay for ..
Eh .. Huh?
- Let's get them!
- Let's catch them, dear!
I'm sorry, fart it ..
I'm going to go upstairs.
Well, it happens when we really
.. You know,
Fear.
How can you survive the day alone ..
Now close your mouth and read maps.
Hmm, up the stairs.
<i>Hmm.</i>
Uh, and then it .. Whoa!
Kids, please, wait!
Turn left!
Turn left other.
Through the door on the next floor.
Uh, above, to the bridge!
- You have reached your goal.
- Ssh, shut up!
Maybe I should talk to him again, and ..
No, there is no longer talk the talk.
I'm going to do this my way, way Grymp.
You stay here alone.
Do not do anything.
Can you do it? Or it
too difficult for a Nestrian?
<i>Hmmmh.</i>
Captain!
Sign!
Hi! How are you?
I was wondering if I could talk to you again?
You again?
Geez, you
stubborn little creatures.
Honor, we are ..
I have a big problem.
Children Our children are still out there.
Captain, you have to rotate the ship ..
I'm sure we have discussed this matter.
But sir, please.
You really begin to test my patience.
But my son
Only he's all I have.
I know, I do not think I could
mengenyahkanmu fast.
I think I can make an exception for a peace agreement
between herbivores and carnivores.
I do not think there would be the loss of a conscious
..
Nestrian.
I told you, there is no point in talking with
these animals.
You know?
We are a great team.
Let us find our children!
It is a place where they are located.
Dinner candles.
Just the two of us.
0h yes, dear.
We have not done this for a long time.
Wow.
It is clearly the way down that far.
Perhaps no other way.
Forget it!
We can not spend the time to play.
You've spent half a day
stupid hat that aims to help us.
But he need protection cap!
I told you he was going to slow us down.
Kawan friends my mountain climber ..
Can we stop for a rest?
There is no time to rest, look!
Well, I guess then the bridge.
Okay, I'm first.
You must run slowly, and one by one.
Keep your distance from each other.
Some of the rock is very loose.
... So wait abaku aba ..
And then ..
And then what?
You must be kidding!
Dinners come.
Obesey, look at that!
You are a giant bees!
Hey, where Leah?
Do not worry, he's fine.
Right Leah?
Never as good as this.
Up, up and away, Captain!
Ave-aye!
If you like this, we'll
reach the top quickly.
What are you doing?
Lower us now!
Wow!
We will soon reach our cruising altitude.
Oh no!
Oh, oh my goodness.
I need to lie down.
You're always lying.
- Leah?
- I knew it!
Do not you anything?
I knew this would happen!
Look! Footpath straight to the top!
Oh yes!
In fact, you can go up there, big guy!
Yes, we are the best team that ever existed
!
Let's go!
I'll go alone.
- What?
- The whole of this team, this is not for me.
But we've had so far!
Far?
I should not even be here.
I'm supposed to be on board with my mother.
And is your fault I was not there!
But Leah ..
You want to go where?
It's safer to stick together.
I went alone.
I do not need advice from a large-sized snails.
Wait, I think I
know how to fix this.
Someone needs a hug!
I'm done. Goodbye.
But I think we are a team.
What do we do now?
If the bid embrace it
is still there, I think I can.
Captain, we get a situation
security breach.
The guards!
I'll take care of him.
Wait a moment.
Sign in, what are you waiting for?
Sir!
What is the problem?
Uh, a Nestrian and Grymp
escape from the bottom of the pack.
Idiot which let
Nestrian a blur?
Go and get them before they rebelled
!
Do not stand there alone!
Entire animal kingdom was in distress!
Yes Sir! Right away, sir!
We can not go on indefinitely.
We must immediately find Leah and Finny.

Grymps showed no fear.

Ah, Leah, right!

Hold your tongue!
What?
I said hold my tongue!
Ah, you save me!
Oh, it's not okay,

And actually, this is the idea.
Heh?

I mean, glad you're back.
Do not worry about me, I
the chatterbox. Further alone.
Hey, look out your way, myopic eye base.
Very dark.
Uh, does anyone have a torch?
Wow ..
It's not too bad.
Finny?
Are you there?
I'm here.
Hey, look at this!
Ta da!
Why can not I do that?
Because you are parasites, worms
and not illuminated.
Follow me.
I would lighten the way.
Oh yes, I was a parasite.
And you turned out to be a good host.
Just because I live in thee
does not mean I like the neighbors.
Do not you anything?
Yes yes, I'm not anything.
Finny, Obesey need a break.
No problem.
This place seems great for camping tonight.
Here?
Come on guys, give me some help.
Believe me, he knows
what he is doing.
You're the Nestrian
really know how to make something good, huh?
Certainly!
We need to peak in the morning.
But the flood ..
It seems never ending.
Maybe we are not destined
survived it all.
You ever think about that?
All my life, the person
(hewan2) always insult me,
say that I'm not good in any case.
I never fit dimanapum.
Now they do not even want me on board that ship.
I just...
Fat?
Not!
Destined to die.
Do not say that!
We must not give up now.
We will rest, and then we will go to the peak
,
and give a signal to the ship that ship.
Right, come on, big fella.
Take a break for a while.
Our journey is still long.
Journey is still long.
You just sit up there.
Come on! I became exposed to
seasick in my sleep here!
Sorry.
Equally hard soil with a stone.
Maybe because it
is a rock, huh?
Hmm...
Ah!
I told you he knows what he is doing.
No doubt.
Do not stop, Obesey.
Go ahead.
OK.
Good night, everybody.
Good night, Finny.
You know, our situation is fine
here.
They may not have gone far.
I wonder if they still survive.
I always tough against him, because
tried to prepare him for life.
Do you understand?
Make her be tough.
And now ..
Hey ..
I had promised my son that
I will bring him on board ship,
and I will keep my promise.
I know Leah with her.

<i>Hmm?</i>
Rain?

We should go from here! Come on, this way!
Come on, Obesey!
Come on, you can do it!

Help him! Help us!
Huh?
Do you want help?
You got it!

Obesey  true.
We are not destined to survive.
I'm sorry for having
dragged you into this situation, Leah.
Hey.
It's not your fault if we fall here.
It was my fault.
I would not survive for
if not for you, Finny.

Not that!

eventually transfer to your rooms.
Rooms? We do not need anymore room.
Come on, dad! Let's go home!
Later I will meet you! I come!

Nestrian.
Initially you want to go up to
ark, and then you want to go.
Why do not you solidify your decision?
- Is not that the Nestrian?
- Oh, yes.

Think maybe we should tell
them in the place of registration, do not you think?

feet when you have fin!
