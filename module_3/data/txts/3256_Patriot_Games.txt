We can't come to the phone right now.
Please leave a message. Thanks.
Mamie, it's Jack.
We're leaving London as planned.
We'll take a cab from the airport.
No need to pick us up.
Eight...
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...
You already own that!
You own everything.
We forgot about Sally's goldfish.
If they're alive, can you feed them?
Mom will make my move.
And if they're not, will you go to
the store and buy similar ones?
See you soon. Bye.
What's happening?
- Yes!
- Oh, no! Another hotel!
- What does he owe you?
- You owe me £1,1 OO.
I don't have it. You win!
- This girl is rich!
- Time to go to sleep.
- Good evening, sir.
- Yes?
Will these do?
Yeah, bring them in...
My wife, I guess.
Candles, champagne...
Sorry I didn't think of this.
That's all right.
Only one of us had to.
- Is she asleep?
- Yep.
- What about your speech?
- I'll wing it.
- You're sure?
- Yep.
We've viewed with awe the protean
events occurring in the former USSR.
Enormous changes have resulted
from these events.
We can now only speculate on the
future of Soviet fleet deployment.
Thanks to the Royal Naval Academy
for inviting me to speak here today.
He's impressed, Sally.
It's just he's a professional soldier.
It's his job not to be distracted.
Come on, we gotta go meet Daddy.
I'm impressed.
- Find it on the map?
- Yeah, we turn left... no, right.
- You're sure?
- Turn right, yes.
We're gonna turn right.
I'm following your map.
You mind your bottom, Paddy Boy.
Move sure and fast.
- You told me that, didn't ya?
- I'm telling you again...
This is like nothing
you've done before, little brother.
- Target leaving the Palace now.
- Right.
Stay awake, lads. Here they come.
Is that good? A little more?
There's Daddy!
Go!
Down! Get down!
Move in!
Get down!
Come!
Get down!
Keep her down!
Get out of the car!
Come on!
Get out!
Open the fucking door!
British!
Open it or I'll blow you up.
Come on, let's go!
Go, go, go!
Paddy?
Stop! Army! Drop it!
Help the boy.
No, he's had it.
It's all right, sweetie.
Everything's going to be OK.
- Stand back, ma'am.
- That's my husband.
I'm a doctor. I will treat him.
Jesus, Jack.
What were you thinking of?
I'm going to set you down, OK?
Stay with me, Jack. You hear me?
Jack, stay with me.
The feeling here is outrage at the
terrorist attack on the Royal Family.
While no group has yet claimed credit,
there is speculation of IRA involvement.
Lord Holmes, the Queen Mother's
cousin and Northern Ireland Minister -
- would have died were
it not for the heroism of-
- John Patrick Ryan, an American
tourist who thwarted the terrorist attack.
A professor at the US Naval Academy,
Ryan is a former marine lieutenant.
Wounded in the attack, Ryan is being
treated at an undisclosed hospital.
Debora Weston,
CNN News, London.
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.
You're alive. I forgive you.
Otherwise...
Hey, pumpkin.
I love you.
I love you too.
You dignify their cowardice
with your silence.
They left you.
They drove off without you.
I wonder why
you think you owe them.
If my mates drove off and left me in
your hands, I'd not only feel no loyalty -
- I'd make sure to kill them.
Who are they, Sean?
Where are they?
The trip was unscheduled. How'd you
know Lord Holmes would be there?
I can't help you if you won't talk.
I'd tear your heart out and serve it to
you with chips, you Fenian bastard!
Not in all eternity
will Sean chirp a word.
Not while his brother lies on a slab.
What's the matter, Jimmy?
Don't you believe it?
It's the entire thing, I don't believe.
The Royal Family, Kevin...
You know that only turns
people against us.
This was totally unauthorised.
- We all know you were behind it.
- Fuck the bloody IRA!
All these years of war
have got us nowhere.
In its heart England is still a monarchy.
That is where we must strike.
At the royals and the ruling class.
You're either with us or against us,
Jimmy Boy.
Make up your mind!
I'm with you.
Good. That's all I wanted to hear.
I'll leave you to it.
Kevin, Charlie's dropping by tonight
to try and straighten things out.
Be smart. Talk to him.
And hold your temper.
I promise.
Thanks, Jimmy.
Kevin!
Kevin, lad! It's me, Charlie.
That's me holding my temper,
Jimmy Boy.
- Oh, damn. I forgot.
- What?
Where's my bag?
Please don't make me wear a rubber.
The Church says it's a sin, darling.
So is this! Darling!
So, what can you tell me about...
this guy?
Sean? He's a nice boy... Sean Miller.
Shot a parish priest in Derry.
During confession.
He thought the Father was informing.
Excuse me, it's not in Mr. Ryan's
best interests or the prosecution's -
- to discuss matters
not related to the events at hand.
If you confirm that the man in the photo
is the one you disarmed in the square -
- I think we'll be through.
I can.
You have anything to add, Mr. Ryan?
Yes, the man I killed was Miller's...
...brother.
- Brother.
Patrick. Not even 17, "Paddy Boy".
Recruited by Sean into the IRA.
The idea is to preserve the
clarity of your eventual testimony.
I read it in the newspaper.
- Please don't read the newspapers.
- Not even Doonesbury?
Do you have anything to add?
No.
Mr. Ryan, I'm Geoffrey Watkins.
Private Secretary to Lord Holmes.
- Pleasure. My wife Catherine.
- How do you do?
- So, Doctor, is your patient healing?
- We're looking forward to going home.
I can imagine.
May I introduce His Lordship?
- Hello.
- It's my great honour to meet you.
- Thank you.
- I am eternally indebted to you.
Thanks for the kind note.
I'm delighted you're here to share
the good news, Mrs. Ryan.
Her Majesty's decided to invest
your husband K.C.V. O -
- Knight Commander
of the Victorian Order.
My congratulations, sir.
Good luck today.
- "Sir Jack"?
- Lady Catherine.
If I'd had more time to think,
I might have done something else.
- You're saying you didn't have time.
- That's correct.
- So, you didn't...
- Didn't what?
Think so. You didn't think
is the point you're trying to make.
No, instead you raced into
a situation of which -
- by your own admission,
you had no understanding -
- attacked my client, who was, in fact,
another pedestrian hurrying to help...
In a ski mask?
...shot a 2nd man in the chest
this one taking you...
After they shot me!
...three shots point blank to
kill the 2nd victim.
I used that force I deemed necessary.
I should say so.
I doubt whether anyone
in this court would disagree.
- Excuse me, I didn't cause this, sir.
- No further questions.
- He did!
- My Lord, there is one more question.
Are you still, Dr. Ryan,
in the paid service of the CIA?
I should remind you
that you're under oath.
- No.
- I beg your pardon.
- No.
- That's all. Thank you.
The witness may stand down.
Thank you.
Gentlemen, this is
an appropriate moment...
Bloody proud of yourself, aren't you?
Stuck your nose where it didn't belong.
Now you've killed my baby brother.
- Hey, Daddy.
- Hey, pumpkin.
Wow, you guys have really grown!
- How are you feeling?
- Not so good.
- Tired?
- No.
I've no idea what time it is.
Feels like morning.
You're telling me!
- Did I miss something?
- No.
But I did!
I'm pregnant.
Honey!
Can I watch some TV?
I'm not at all tired.
What?
- Plates.
- I don't have any say in this, do I?
This is a family.
Everybody's got a say.
But my say is after the fact.
Or am I wrong?
- No, you're right.
- Michaela despises her little sister.
Ready for this? It could be
even worse... a baby brother.
Oh, no. Boys!
- Jack!
- True. Boys are...
You deny the IRA was
behind the assassination attempt?
When the IRA carry out
any form of campaign, they admit to it.
That's the policy.
They proudly say they did it.
Have the IRA admitted to this?
Common sense, logic, reason...
Can I suggest some names?
You don't think raising money in
America for the IRA will be affected?
- Morning, Mr. Cooley.
- And to you, madam. How's business?
I came upon this first edition
at an estate auction.
Can your man restore it?
- When do you want this by?
- Soon.
It's very pressing.
I'm not sure... The binder
may have some trouble with this.
- Is that so?
- I'll see what I can do.
- He's not a miracle worker, you know.
- Obviously, he's not, Mr. Cooley.
The best you can arrange then.
- Thanks, Mr. Cooley.
- Good day, madam.
Hello, Sean.
Don't mind if I ride with you, do you?
I disapprove of your deeds, Sean, but
I can't bring myself to condemn you.
I can't because I understand
where the hatred comes from.
I more than understand it.
But we're now very near
the darkest hole in Great Britain -
- and you still won't speak to me.
They're raising the bridge.
We'll be here five minutes.
Understood.
Mobile Three, Lymington.
Open the door!
- Open it or I'll kill him.
- What do we do?
- We open the door.
- Open it!
- For Christ's sake...
- But what?
Wait until they kill him,
then open the door?
- Your guns.
- We are unarmed.
Just who the hell are you?
Get them out!
Get your head down.
- Get down on the bloody ground!
- Don't you fucking move!
- You'd think we'd forget about you?
- Unlock the cuffs.
Inspector Robert Highland.
This is a friend of mine.
We meet at last. What's the pay
for selling out your own people?
Get on with it and be on your way.
Very well.
If that's how you feel about it...
Come on, Cath!
- Have I got the tickets or what?
- I don't have them.
- I don't have them!
- They're on the fridge.
- Dad?
- Honey, there's plenty of time.
- Hello, Admiral.
- Morning, Jack.
- You know Marty Cantor.
- How's the shoulder?
Not too bad.
Something's come up.
Can we sit down and have a chat?
He escaped while they were moving
him. We think he's left the country.
Excuse me. Let's deal in what
we know and not what we don't.
We know he's escaped
in Kent near the Channel.
If he's left the country...
Jack, listening?
The chances he'd come here
are so remote I have trouble saying it.
Your first instinct was to come
all the way here and tell me.
Marty, want to excuse us
a few minutes?
I've got a few more weeks
before school starts, but I gotta
dig in and prepare a few lectures.
Wanna come look over what we got?
You might turn up something new.
You're asking me
if I want to come back.
Yep.
- We'll go next week, honey.
- All right.
Sorry, Sean Miller escaped.
What does that mean?
They wanted me to know... thought
I might be concerned. I'm not!
The IRA's not stupid.
They won't follow me over here.
They agree. They're gone. That's it.
They didn't ask you
to come back to CIA?
I said no.
Just like that.
I don't wanna go back, honey.
- I saw them coming and I just...
- I know.
I can't go back to that life again,
you know.
Sally, wait up, honey.
I bet your cell was better than this.
Bloody Ritz in comparison.
At least you had your own toilet.
Cheer up. You've just been
spared from hell on earth.
- A word of gratitude might be in order.
- I don't feel like resting.
Laying about
like a complacent tourist.
To build an army, we've got to train like
soldiers. We can't do that in Ireland.
- Bleedin' waste of time.
- There's laying about and laying low.
- There's a difference.
- Is there?
Lord Holmes
should worry about complacency.
Next time he won't be so lucky.
Post him back to Whitehall in bits -
- if that's what frees Irish prisoners.
That's not what I'm thinking of.
What Ryan has done can't be undone.
Stop thinking about it.
I can't.
How could this have happened?
Highland picked the day, the decoy
routes, his men, and still they knew.
- He had two children, apparently.
- Tragic!
31 people knew your itinerary the day
of your attack and of Miller's transfer -
- five of whom are now dead.
I suggest limiting your appointments.
I will not have my itinerary
dictated to me by terrorists.
The traitor had better
pray to God I never find him.
We know you'll do
your best, Sergeant.
- We don't know if we're coming home.
- We don't know if we're coming home.
- Stand, buckle up, shuffle to the door.
- Stand, buckle up, shuffle to the door.
Jump right out
and shout Marine Corps!
Egesta appealed to Athens
on what basis? On what grounds?
Mr. Viederman...
Bad time for you?
Well... they said they'd be grateful.
Didn't they?
"Fight our battle.
The world will fear and respect you."
- Didn't the world fear Athens already?
- Didn't matter.
- Why not?
- Pride, sir.
That's the real battle they lost.
Attention on deck!
Attention to orders.
I've a presentation to make -
- for service above and beyond the call
of duty of a tourist. Even a marine.
We recognise Professor John Ryan
with the Order of the Purple Target.
And hope that he will duck next time
lest he become part of history -
- rather than a teacher of it.
- How old is he?
- Ten.
- Plate glass window?
- Yes.
- Here we go... Hi, guys!
- Morning, Catherine.
I've got a retina at 1:OO. We might have
to bump it. This could take some time.
- Yep, let's bump it.
- We're all set.
OK, let's do it.
So, you just waded on in
like John Wayne.
Why'd you do it?
What were you thinking, man?
- I don't know. I wasn't thinking.
- That's it? You sound like my students.
It just pissed me off.
I couldn't just watch him shoot
those people in front of me.
It was... rage.
Pure rage...
Just made me mad.
Here's hoping
you never get mad at me, man.
She's late, Sean.
And she was at this dance.
This guy, at the end, he...
- Kind of cute, isn't she?
- Is she?
Bye. See ya.
- Hi, Mommy.
- Sweetie, how are you?
Let's do it.
Damn!
Highway 5O. West.
- Good night, Doc.
- Good night.
- Dr. Ryan...
- He's getting away.
Where's Sean Miller?
Where's Sean Miller?
- Dr. Catherine Ryan, please.
- Dr. Ryan, are you all right?
- How long?
- Dr. Ryan...
Come on! Come on!
- Surgery.
- Yes, this is Dr. Ryan.
- Thomson retinal scan results, please.
- Hold, please.
Come on, get off the phone.
- Look, Mom!
- It's beautiful.
- Are you still holding?
- Yes, I'm still holding.
I'd like to speak with Dr. Sutton.
Operator, I want to cut into
a phone call. The number is 555-3464.
Yeah, it's a mobile phone.
What do you mean I can't?
Faster, damn it.
- Dr. Ryan? The retinal scan is fine.
- That's great. Thank you.
Jesus!
- Hello!
- Cathy...
Something's happened.
Is Sally with you?
- Yeah.
- Hi, Dad!
- Is everything all right?
- Everything's fine.
- There she is!
- Right!
I want you to get off the highway
and go to the nearest police station.
- The police station?
- Just get off the highway right now.
Steady, mate. Steady.
- Where are you now?
- I'm at Rowe Blvd.
There's a state police barracks
on Houston St. Meet you there.
- Is something wrong, Mom?
- No, everything's fine.
They're gone!
Coming in.
- Mr. Ryan?
- Yeah.
Your wife's OK.
She has a concussion.
- She's pregnant.
- The baby's OK. Don't worry.
- What about my daughter?
- Let's sit down for a moment.
- No, talk to me.
It will be a while till we know.
Maybe in the morning.
Where's Sally?
She's in the Recovery Room.
They're watching her.
We'll know in 7 or 8 hours.
They removed her spleen.
She's in pretty bad shape.
I'm sorry.
In a moment, we expect a statement
from Paddy O'Neill of Sinn Fein.
- Jack, here you go.
- O'Neill is in the US for fundraising.
You OK?
Here's Cary Johnson
ready to speak with Paddy O'Neill.
I'm praying for the recovery of
the victims of this senseless attack.
Sinn Fein and most Irish Catholics
are outraged at this heinous crime.
I want to share with Dr. Ryan
our empathy and anguish -
- but I'll wait for
a more appropriate time.
- Can you confirm that the IRA?
- The IRA are not behind this attack.
- No more questions.
- Thank you, Mr. O'Neill.
- She's going to be OK.
- Thank you.
It's all right. She's all right.
Mr. Ryan...
Mr. Ryan, I'd like to share
with you our deep regret about...
Mr. Ryan!
Jack, you're involved!
It's not good process.
You're a crime victim.
That doesn't make for good analysis.
Even if you knew something
about terrorism which you don't!
I have guys on it!
Guys who know all about the IRA...
I'm not standing here hat in hand!
I'm telling you I want back in.
- Jack...
- Sir...
Thank God about Sally.
Alice and I are relieved beyond words.
- You manage any sleep?
- Not much, sir.
I'm interrupting.
You were explaining
how we're better off without Jack...
...or something on those lines.
Marc Spiva, Jack Ryan, Tony Ferro.
- Hi.
- Alex Winter.
Nice to meet you, Alex.
- Well...
- Rose!
- You're looking better than I expected.
- It's an illusion.
It would have to be.
Good to see you, regardless.
We've carved a niche for you.
Here's your night table reading.
Oh, my!
"Father killed by RUC, Belfast, 1979."
Good morning.
Cut the engine, please. Your I. D?
- Did you see the game?
- It was all right.
- What the hell!
- Nobody move!
- Keep your hands off him.
- Get 'em up!
Mornin'.
Kevin O'Donnell, IRA strategist,
friend of the Millers.
After Tim Miller was killed in '79,
he looked after Sean and Patrick.
This photo's recent. I think if we find
O'Donnell, Miller will be at his side.
- Are you with me, Jack?
- Yeah, just thinking.
- What about the gun?
- Think it's registered?
- Son of a bitch!
- What?
SO-13 gets an anonymous tip
about a bomb factory in a flat.
They get some IRA bad guys,
but realise the tip was a set-up.
We got three IRA hitmen
at a farm hit by somebody else.
That's British soldiers getting
out of hand. They're not above it.
No, look. We got IRA brigade
commander Jimmy O'Reardon.
He checks into a cheap hotel
and ends up shot in the head.
- That's how long after the farmhouse?
- Same day.
- Same day!
- What are you coming to, Jack?
Jack! Where are you going?
I'm going to throw some water
on my face.
Jack!
Excuse me.
- One of us is in the wrong room.
- I'm sorry.
That's OK.
Jack!
When the IRA carry out any form
of campaign, they admit to it.
Common sense, logic...
Listen!
Who are we looking for?
IRA terrorists or some
ultra-violent faction of the IRA?
Jimmy O'Reardon checked into a hotel
with a woman with long red hair!
This is who we should be looking for!
We find her... we'll find him.
I saw his wife and daughter die,
but she and Neddie blew it.
Ryan's still alive.
- They're not dead, Sean.
- What?
They survived it.
I can't say it plainer than that.
- It doesn't matter. It served its purpose.
- It does matter!
America holds its breath
whenever a little girl falls down a well.
You used a sub-machine gun
on one returning from school.
We've started a war. The Brits
are tearing apart Belfast for the IRA.
Their American money deny the hits
so loud, the IRA looks only more guilty.
The war is raging. When it's over,
we'll be the only ones left standing.
Sean, I let you go for Paddy Boy,
but that's it!
We've got work to do
and it's not in Maryland.
Hello.
- Yeah?
- How's the family, Ryan?
Nearly lost them, didn't you?
It's easy to get at them.
You should look after
your family better.
- Are you there?
- Yeah.
Your little girl's feeling better, eh?
Lost her spleen. Pity that.
Makes it tough on her to fight off
infection, eh, Jacky?
You sick son of a bitch!
It was him, wasn't it?
He's never going to leave us alone.
He'll never get close to us again.
That's why he calls. It's all he can do.
You get him, Jack.
I don't care what you do. Just get him.
Can I buy you a drink?
No...
Let me buy you one.
Barney, two whiskies.
- The IRA's not responsible for all this.
- You waiting for me to agree?
- I've said this 'til I'm blue in the face.
- That's the point, isn't it?
You take credit for one thing, deny it for
another. Nobody believes you anymore.
I want to know where
Sean Miller and Kevin O'Donnell are.
Let me understand this. You want me
to sell out my fellow Irishman to you.
Is that why you came here?
You don't know me at all.
I think I do!
I don't give a damn what they've done.
The day I sell out my countrymen is the
day I put a bullet through my own head.
- That's it, then.
- That's it.
On second thought
I won't have a drink with you.
- OK, then I'll go home.
- Have a safe trip.
I'll call the TV stations. Let them film
my daughter's hospital room.
Put it on the evening news.
I don't give a shit whether you did it
or not. Nor will anyone else.
I'll put such a stranglehold on your gun
money you'll be back to throwing rocks.
I'll fucking destroy you!
It will be my mission in life!
Excuse me.
Lads, did you hear that?
Stand sideways,
you're less of a target.
Yes!
Satellite's coming!
Celts, let's go!
Get inside!
So... SO-13 traced the weapons
in the Lord Holmes incident -
- to an arms dealer
that supplies Qaddafi.
When Sean escaped, he was last
seen in the Channel in a gale -
- which didn't figure until I checked
the freighters out there that day.
Syrian registry, carrying arms
to client states including Qaddafi.
- Sean takes a slow boat to Libya.
- Exactly!
Our satellites
photograph how many camps?
- 182.
- 182 camps a day in North Africa.
Libyan bases, PLO, Red Brigade,
Action Directe, German Red Army...
The day this ship docked, there are
only 9 camps with people arriving.
This one we know for sure is PLO.
This one Shining Path.
These seven
we're not so sure about. Why?
We've got satellites in...
Because those camps know
exactly when the satellites pass over.
Unless you retask those satellites
so we can get a real look -
- we'll never
know which camp they're at.
Do you know how big a deal
it is to retask those satellites?
Yeah.
Bring up Camp 18 again.
Tighten on the camp here.
Let's look up in here.
See what we can see.
Show me this grouping here.
No, there's nothing.
Go back to the bigger picture.
Let me see down here.
What's that?
Tighten up on that, will you?
Can you enhance that?
Sharpen it up?
Tits.
SAS could take out
this camp in under two minutes.
Kill everybody there
and be gone before the echo fades.
Are you sure
it's the same woman?
Keep at it, then.
Son of a bitch.
Hi.
Read it again, Daddy.
"The sun did not shine.
It was too wet to play.
"So we sat in the house
all that cold, cold, wet day."
"I sat there with Sally,
we sat there, we two.
"And I said:
How I wish we had something to do!
"Too wet to go out,
too cold to play ball.
"So we sat in the house,
we did nothing at all.
"So all we could do was just
sit, sit, sit, sit.
"And we did not like it,
not one little bit.
"And then,
something went boom."
Paddy O'Neill can sleep at night.
In fact, he probably enjoys the irony.
She's not Irish. She's English.
This is the girl you saw in the blink
of an eye in a jeep doing 4Omph?
- Yeah.
- What am I supposed to do here?
Tell SO-13 her name. Give them her
picture. Tell them about the rare books.
- What do you mean "what do you do?"
- What about you, Jack?
You walk into an IRA bar.
You approach the IRA's bagman and in
front of his guys, you threaten him?
You never were a field man.
You are an analyst. Analyse that!
I'm not after your job, Marty.
- I'm after Sean Miller.
- Then, think!
You tell O'Neill you're looking for a girl.
He obliges you with some pictures.
And you believe him?
I didn't tell him I was looking for a girl.
Sergeant... Come and look at this.
A bit of a bookworm myself.
Not that I look it.
What's your passion?
Mysteries? Spy novels? Ian Fleming?
- This is a rare bookshop.
- Rare books? So they are.
- Will you locate the problem?
- I already have.
Your wiring dates from
before World War I.
It's what we call
in the electrical business: "rare".
- Can you fix it?
- Sure.
- Fix it!
- Can you afford it?
Just fix it!
Hello!
- He's seen it?
- I don't know.
He's got it. Look.
What do you make of this?
I have no idea!
Damn!
I have to go out now for a few minutes
to deliver some books.
- Please, keep about your repairs.
- I'll be here all week. Don't worry.
He's mine!
Damn!
- The White House dinner's no problem.
- What is the problem?
No problem.
Just running out of dates.
We could do that. Move that to there
which would leave us... the 14th?
- The 14th.
- Geoffrey...
Let's schedule a presentation dinner at
our embassy in Washington on the... -
...14th.
- The 14th!
Let's cover this again so I can get
it clear. We start in Washington...
- Geoffrey Watkins.
- I'm trying to reach Mr. Titus.
- Is that Ext. 2691?
- No, it's 2619.
I'm terribly sorry.
- Why are you up? Go back to bed.
- I want to be there when she wakes up.
- I'll go with you, then take a cab back.
- OK.
- Hello.
- Sir John Ryan, please.
Just a minute.
It's for you, Sir John.
Mr. Ryan has a special celebration
that evening.
- He invited you to join them.
- Where? At his house?
Yes, sir.
Why not?
We shot this eight days ago in Berlin.
One... Two... Three... Four Brits
travelling with him.
- Light arms.
- The heavy stuff's in the cars.
He's German... He's German.
This boring you, Sean?
Six altogether. Should be the same
security when Holmes's in Washington.
You got to find
the moment when he's unprotected.
Four days, Washington.
One day, New York... shopping.
Yeah... Two Caucasians.
Take a look at the one with the hat.
- His arms look a little pink.
- Sunburn. New arrival.
What do you think?
Same guy?
That rare book dealer,
Dennis Cooley, is bald.
It's possible there could be a woman
in some of these camps -
- but with her and Cooley
in the same place. If that is Cooley...
The odds of coincidence
are dropping fast.
Still, there's no way I can be...
absolutely certain.
Excuse me, Jack. Tell me one thing
in life that is absolutely for certain.
My daughter's love.
What I need to hear is your best guess
and I think I've heard it.
Haven't I?
The bastards took away my book shop.
And my books!
I'm sorry, you can't come. You haven't
got the training. This mission is messy.
I can fire a gun.
Sorry, Dennis.
- Where are you taking me, Marty?
- You've taken us, Jack...
- Satellite now entering target area.
...into battle.
Enlargement Sector Four.
Airborne Support approaching target.
E. T.A. 35 seconds.
SAS team on ground.
- Enlarge Camp 18.
- Enlarging it.
- Enlarge primary target.
- Enlarging.
That is a kill!
Targets have been neutralised.
Keyhole is passing out of vision.
It's over.
- Roger that.
- Would your men outside like coffee?
No thank you. They're fine.
Thank you, Sally, for inviting us
to your homecoming.
You're a lovely young lady.
My pleasure to finally met you.
You're welcome.
- Can I do the presentation after dinner?
- Sure.
Would you like to see it now?
Geoffrey!
- That's very nice.
- Didn't I already give you one of those?
Is that your second piece of cake,
my little sweetie?
- Where's the bathroom, Jack?
- Second door on the left.
- More coffee anyone?
- I'd love some.
- Excuse me.
- Here it comes.
Bathroom?
Someone in there?
That's not it.
That's the basement.
- Jack...? Marty.
- Hey, what's going on?
Sorry to interrupt the party,
but you need to know right away.
- SAS made positive I.D. On Cooley.
- What about the others?
It's pretty messy.
We need to verify the dental records.
But they're on top of it.
- Oh, great.
- What?
The storm caused a black-out.
I've got to light candles.
- I'll light one for you too.
- OK, Marty, thanks.
- Here we go!
- What? Forget to pay your bill?
- Robert...! Funny.
- Is everyone all right?
Fine, Jack. This doesn't happen often,
Lord Holmes. Only when royalty visit.
- Is something wrong?
- Come with me.
If the storm had cut the lights,
they'd be out in the boathouse too.
Power comes in from the street,
branching off to here.
Jesus...
This is Ryan. Any DSS agent?
Any DSS agent? This is Ryan.
Federal Troopers. Anyone?
Is anyone reading me? Anybody?
- Can I play when the lights go on?
- Sweetie pie, you need some sleep.
Goddamnit!
- Don't tell me.
- Quite a storm.
Take your hands off me.
What do you think you're doing?
- Gun!
- Jack!
Stay right there!
Rob, over here.
How many are coming?
Where's Sean Miller?
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Give me the gun.
Five, six... maybe more.
I'll get the others.
Don't turn on the lights.
- Take this. In the basement, quick!
- Cathy's upstairs putting Sally to bed.
What's wrong?
Come on, Ryan. Show yourself.
- Annette, upstairs.
- Right.
Come on, sweetie.
Come on.
What's wrong, Mommy?
Now, you've got to help.
Hide behind the suits.
Oh, God, Jack.
What did you do with the shells?
Go, go, go!
Get down!
Get back!
You all right?
- Daddy.
- Sally! It's OK, honey.
Come on, come on!
Honey,
you just got to be real quiet.
Gotcha!
Christ!
Come on.
- Who is off the air?
- DSS, state troopers, the security rep.
Give me Hostage Rescue, now!
Robby...! Open up!
Robby, it's us.
Jack!
- They're outside.
- Cool it. Can't ransom a dead Royal.
- They're all over the place.
- Stay close to me.
How were you going to get away?
Want to go for the other knee?
Boats. At the bottom of the cliff.
There are ropes.
Kevin!
You've killed him!
No, Sean. No!
We need Holmes alive.
- We're past that.
- Alive!
Come on!
- Any contact?
- Still off the air.
There he is!
Stay down!
Come on, you bastards!
Come on! Come on!
He's alone. He's leading us away from
the Royal. Turn around, Sean.
- No!
- Turn it around, Sean.
- No!
- Sean!
Turn around!
- Forget about Ryan.
- Don't blow the mission now, boy!
That's not my mission.
You crazy bastard!
- Had enough to eat? Some toast?
- Pancakes.
- No time for pancakes. Want toast?
- Toast.
- Somebody going to get that?
- Getting it.
- Sally.
- Hello. Yes, it is. Hold on a second.
- It's Dr. Zaillian.
- The amnio.
- Hello.
- Is it gonna be OK?
It's gonna be fine, honey.
We're just waiting to find out.
- Great!
- Want strawberry on your toast?
Hold on...
Want to know what it is?
- Did he tell you?
- He's asking. I'm asking you.
- I don't know. Do you want to know?
- I don't know. Do you?
I wanted to know,
but now I'm not sure.
- Hold on. We're discussing it.
- Neither. I do and I don't.
He's waiting.
OK...! Tell us.
OK, tell us.
Thank you!
