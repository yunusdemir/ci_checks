Hey, stop.
What are you doing?
Hey!
H-hot!
Not ready yet?
Be patient.
But I've got a TV rehearsal.
What a hustler.
Give me a hand!
- Hurry up!
- I know.
- Your bandage...
- Oh yeah.
Over there.
Pose.
It's summer by the sea... come on now.
Hurry!
This isn't a thriller!
- What is it?
- What's wrong?
Watch out!
<i>ATRAGON</i>
It's dangerous. Keep back.
Your stolen car?
Yes, I'm certain.
How did it get stolen?
I was waiting for Mr. Shindo
at Towa Construction Company.
Suddenly, I was choked and passed out.
A kidnapper wouldn't jump into a cold
sea...
Who are you?
I'm a reporter.
Will you explain again?
Again?
Until I'm satisfied.
You were taking PR pictures.
What time was it?
About 20 minutes past 12.
A man came out of the sea?
- Yes.
- Here, right here.
He appeared suddenly.
Seemed made out of vapor, didn't he?
Or steam.
Be serious, will you?
We are... as truthful as a camera.
Why would he let off steam?
I don't know. But it's true.
Officer...
The hands that choked me from
behind were hot, like fire!
Officer.
What is it?
Nothing down there.
I didn't find any bodies.
There!
- Get on the ball! I found a model!
- A model?
Miss!
Very nice.
A nice model.
What?
It's Action Magazine.
They want the cover picture.
It's ready. So-so.
So-so? I like that.
- Mad? Find her then.
- Why?
For my model.
But 10 million people in Tokyo,
about half are women... I can't find her.
Find this number.
Easy.
I've never played sleuth before.
"SO 72-95".
Did you steal something?
What?
Police officers are here.
More questions?
An engineer was kidnapped at a dam
site.
He's the second man since last night.
Vapor man again?
Gave off steam like a geyser.
Geyser man?
So you believe us now?
No! We have no evidence at all...
Only one thing to go on.
Those two who were kidnapped are
civil engineers and experts on cave-ins.
Was it a coincidence?
By the way...
Earthquake!
The Vapor man!
A man to see you, sir.
U. Unno, True Story Magazine reporter?
His business?
He said he would like to ask you
about the Imperial Navy enigma.
Enigma?
Tell him I have nothing to do with it.
You don't?
I see. You are a shipping
company president now.
But you're the former Admiral Kusumi
of the Japanese Navy.
Am I wrong?
I have no sensational war stories.
You've got one secret?
I feel chilled... excuse me.
About your secret.
A special submarine which
never appeared to the public...
A weekly wrote it up...
A-400, the largest submarine.
Old news.
Yes, that's right.
A-400, 401, and 402 were
disposed of after the surrender.
That's right.
But there was another submarine
sailed on the night the war ended...
...A- 403.
403? Not even interesting as fiction.
The captain was Commander Jinguji...
He was your right-hand man,
best sub man...
Where did he go?
You know what his special mission was.
Don't be silly!
He died before the surrender
off the coast of Saipan.
A fine man.
He is alive.
What?
That's what reports say.
Hello, it's me.
You found her?
I'm better than a cop.
What now?
What? Get her consent?
Maker her pose nude?
Fool!
I didn't say nude!
It's utterly idiotic!
Groundless entertainment is stupid.
Did my father really die?
Makoto, what are you implying?
I'm sorry.
Your father was a fine Navy officer and
unequaled in shipbuilding techniques.
The night before he left for an attack,
he came to me and...
...asked me to look after you.
You were 3 at the time.
Did he really have to
leave his only child and go?
That's war.
Country comes before personal
feelings.
Country?
Yes, patriotism.
Patriotism?
Young people now may not understand
it.
It's here.
Kokoku Shipping.
That car!
Come on.
- Should we go to her house?
- That's my boy.
Never let the prey get away? I know.
What's wrong?
Forget that phony reporter's words.
It's not that. Lately a strange man
has been following me.
He's watching me when I go out
or when I'm near my apartment.
I'm frightened.
Perhaps it's best to notify the police.
If anything happens to you,
I won't be able to face Jinguji.
Where are we? This is a wrong road.
Please be quiet, Admiral.
What? Who are you?
Something's wrong.
They're headed straight for the sea!
Admiral, please get out.
What do you want me to do?
I want you to obey my orders.
Over there!
Hold it!
What's this?
- Violence is not good!
- What are you going to do with them?
I will have them pledge
loyalty to the Mu Empire.
The Mu Empire?
I'm Mu Agent No. 23.
You're mad!
It's a mythical Empire which sank into
the Pacific Ocean...
...thousands of years ago!
You're well informed.
It's nonsense!
Well, you'll see.
Are you crazy?
Let go!
We have special energy. It's useless.
Be quiet!
Hot!
You two will work for us as slaves.
Slaves?
Uncle!
Our Agents.
- A submarine will come for us soon.
- A submarine?
Admiral, even if you kill me,
other agents will come to get you.
Come with me and I won't shoot.
No, we'll meet again.
<i>METROPOLITAN POLICE DEPT.</i>
So, you are the one who fired?
Yes.
He escaped into the sea?
The point is they're sent
all over the world.
What agent?
A Mu agent.
The Mu Empire? Is it in Africa?
Think so?
No, it sank into the Pacific Ocean
12,000 years ago.
Sir, this.
This is for you, Mr. Kusumi.
For me?
Admiral Kusumi <i>c/o</i> Police Chief Ito.
From Mu Empire Agent No. 23.
It may be an explosive. I'll open it.
- A time bomb?
- Please.
It seems like a film.
The Pacific Ocean...
12,000 years ago, the glorious Mu
Empire existed in the Pacific Ocean.
The whole world was Mu Empire's
colony.
You will be shown proof.
Cursed by fate, she sank to the
bottom of the sea in one night.
But our ancestors survived.
The Mu people far surpass
the people who live on earth.
With terrestrial heat we made a sun.
We live at the bottom of the sea
by using buried resources.
Mr. Kusumi, the A-403!
Why is the A-403 there?
The Japanese Navy's pride...
it is the best and largest submarine.
Commanded by Capt. Jinguji.
We regret he and his crew
were not on it when we took it.
Admiral Kusumi...
Our reports say Capt. Jinguji is building
a more powerful...
...and efficient submarine.
Atragon could be called
an undersea battleship.
As you know, Admiral.
Now, in conclusion...
Stop the construction
of Atragon immediately.
And return the world to the Mu Empire,
so we can inhabit the earth again.
Listen to our people's joyous voices!
If you refuse...
...our curse and Manda's,
our deity's messenger, will be on you.
Are we sane?
I think so.
So the world was the Mu Empire's
colony?
It's a stupid joke.
Joke?
Wasn't that the real A-403?
It could be an imitation.
What do you think?
So it's a blackmail case, isn't it?
The police can't cope with it.
The perps are too big.
<i>FILMS THREATEN NATIONS</i>
<i>EMERGENCY MEETING AT U.N.</i>
<i>The U.N. Met about the Mu film.</i>
<i>Most of the delegates were skeptical.</i>
<i>It took only 10 minutes to</i>
<i>decide to ignore them.</i>
<i>End of special news.</i>
Captain, something ahead!
Captain, starboard...
Stop the engine!
Captain! Captain!
Full speed astern!
SOS, SOS...
<i>MU DECLARATION SHOCKS WORLD</i>
<i>VENICE DESTROYED</i>
<i>HONG KONG IN RUINS</i>
The U.N. Sets up a United Defense HQ
to cope with the emergency.
Trouble in "B" Block Area, long.
140º31 'E, lat. 9º20'N.
Immediately, orders are
sent to the Red Satan...
...the world's newest atomic submarine
which is operating in the area.
The Red Satan was crushed
by water pressure.
It was the world's best submarine.
I'm afraid there's nothing we can do.
Of course, we could use the H-bomb.
But I doubt its power
in high pressure water.
And its use is limited
due to moral principles...
Atragon comes to mind.
We have no idea of its efficiency.
But the Mu Empire has noticed it.
It must have something that
they are scared of.
Please contact Captain Jinguji at once.
Contact?
I don't know where he is.
But the film said you know where he is.
I don't know!
Then why did you remain silent
when Captain Jinguji left?
Mr. Kusumi.
The U.N. Requests that
the Atragon be used.
Very well.
I was silent for the Captain's sake,
but I will tell you.
The Captain revolted.
Revolted?
That's all.
Yes?
- Police Dept. Is on the phone.
- Police Dept?
Hello. Kusumi speaking.
What? You caught a Mu man?
Sir.
Thank you for coming.
Is he the man who shadowed you?
Yes, he is.
But he is not Agent No. 23
who tried to kidnap us.
No, he was a spare man.
Any evidence?
We've been questioning him, but
his only answer is a number... 8561.
8561? The number's too big.
Fool!
I'm not a Mu, I'm a Japanese!
Why did you follow her?
You are trying to kidnap her, so you
can find out where Captain Jinguji is.
No!
- Then why?
- Be quiet!
Wait!
It's probably the
Japanese Navy tag number...
Soldiers called them reservation
numbers to Yasukuni Shrine.
I'm former Rear Admiral Kusumi.
Your name?
Warrant Officer Amano, sir!
You know me?
Yes, Captain Jinguji told me.
What?
He's alive?
Um...
Is he?
Yes, sir!
Where is he?
- I can't say, sir!
- What!
That's his orders, sir.
Admiral, this earthquake
isn't a coincidence.
Remember me? I'm Mu Agent No. 23.
Where is the broadcasting room?
The world must obey the Mu Empire
now...
...and become our colony.
Order Captain Jinguji
to stop building Atragon.
If you refuse, we will annihilate you!
Officer Amano, where is the Captain?
That's a secret.
Please let me see my father.
It will be against his orders.
I'm a True Story reporter.
Even a dog, if it's alert,
notices something.
Officer Amano.
As it is, the world will be destroyed.
Your superior, Captain Jinguji's
daughter, too.
You want her to die?
Quiet!
Officer, I know you're
loyal to the Captain.
I'll explain to him later, so tell me.
I see.
I can't tell you where he is,
but I'll take you, sir.
Mr. Amano, it's all right now, isn't it?
What?
The Atragon base.
Which island is it?
- Navy secret.
- Navy?
Japan renounced war in her
constitution.
You'll see.
Why did you bring him?
He would write it up if we didn't.
With us, the secret is safe.
Hierarch, Agent No. 23 has returned.
Will we know soon where
Captain Jinguji's base is?
Yes, a contact party of Kusumi has left.
Good.
It will please our Majesty.
Just wait and see.
We'll find out where it is.
Keep an eye on them.
Yes, sir.
What happened?
Cave-in! Power Room 57!
What?
The Japanese slaves
just finished checking!
- Send them again!
- Yes, sir.
Hurry up!
Oh, Mu God!
We are trying to build a
glorious Mu Empire on earth again!
Oh, Mu God!
Please transfer our hardships
to the slaves on earth!
- Don't salute. This isn't the Navy.
- Yes, sir.
We left the plane 3 days ago.
How much longer will it take?
- We will arrive at midnight.
- Midnight?
- What's the name of the island?
- You'll see, sir.
A stubborn fellow.
What is it? Depressed?
It's nothing.
I'm worried.
What would my father
think if he knew I came?
Oh, that...
Of course he would
give you a big welcome.
You think so?
Are you bitter towards him?
No, I'm not.
But I don't understand him.
A father loves his child.
He was worried about you. That's why
he sent the Warrant Officer secretly.
Then why didn't he say so?
It's an old-fashioned patriotism.
People thought it effeminate
to think of home.
Please go in.
We can't afford to be caught.
Hey!
Please get ready to land! Hurry!
There?
Yes.
My hunch was wrong! I thought
it would be an uninhabited island.
It's big!
All right, get off now.
Who is it?
It's... it's me!
What?
It's me.
Oh, Amano, all right.
Please.
Please get in.
It's stuck!
Here.
Everyone, please get out and push!
Are you ready?
Huh? Where is the True Story's
reporter?
There he is.
How can you?
Look at that. It's amazing!
Iron pyrites, bauxite, manganese.
Untapped resources!
<i>GOTEN KENBU CORPS</i>
Amano is back!
This is Admiral Kusumi.
I am Lieutenant Fuji.
I'm Kusumi.
This is Miss Jinguji.
Please relax. The Captain?
I'll contact him, sir!
Amano, ask them to rest.
Mr. Kusumi, isn't it strange?
Whats strange?
There are no docks or factory.
Underground.
Hear it?
Faint machine noises.
Thank you for waiting.
Commander is here.
Jinguji!
It's been some time, sir!
I didn't know you were alive.
I thank you for treating
my revolt quietly.
It's over and done with.
Captain...
This is Makoto.
Surprised? She's become beautiful.
Thank you!
Please relax.
It's an amazing place. Any natives?
Only those helping us.
It's ideal for our base.
The Atragon?
Atragon?
I see.
I'm wrong?
We are testing Goten-go tomorrow.
Goten-go?
That's Atragon.
Please rejoice.
We can serve the Navy again.
Do you have any idea why I came?
Amano told me.
That makes it simpler.
The world urgently needs Atragon.
The world is waiting.
I refuse.
What?
Goten-go is for Japan
when she's active again.
She's for Japan...
Think it over.
The war ended 20 years ago.
Our Corps hasn't surrendered yet!
Wait!
Not even a kind word for
your daughter! War crazy!
War crazy?
Excuse me!
Who is that man?
I guarantee that he won't
make Makoto unhappy.
The Captain hasn't been around.
Is he angry?
No, he was always stubborn.
We're not welcome?
But we can't go back.
- I'll show you the dock, sir.
- Where is the Captain?
He has been up all night
preparing for the test.
Who is it?
I'm sorry. I got lost
when I was taking a walk.
Don't wander around!
I'm sorry.
All clear!
This is the entrance to the dock. Please.
<i>Prepare for takeoff.</i>
<i>Bow, ready for takeoff.</i>
<i>Mid-section, ready for takeoff.</i>
<i>Engine room, ready for takeoff.</i>
<i>Stern, ready for takeoff.</i>
Admiral, I've been waiting for you.
This is Goten-go or Atragon.
Lt. Fuji.
Yes, sir. Standing by.
We will start a test operation now.
In position!
In position!
- Open gate No. 1.
- Open gate No. 1.

<i>Start flooding!</i>

- Slow speed ahead.
Surfacing!
Hold your horses! A fish leaped.
I knew it wasn't enough noise for a ship.
Look!
Congratulations!
Wonderful performance.
We'll test the Cold Air Cannon
tomorrow.
The Cold Air Cannon?
It is an instant freeze cannon.
It's absolute zero... 460ºF below zero.
One thing puzzles me.
Yes?
Why does the Mu have the A-403?
And how do they know about Atragon?
It's simple.
When we were seeking
for a place for our base...
...an unidentified submarine attacked
us.
All of the plan would fail if we died.
So we used A-403 as a decoy to escape.
When they captured it, it was empty.
The blue print of Atragon was left
behind.
Of course they didn't have
the details but they marked us.
I see.
Please, Admiral.
Drop the Admiral... touching an old scar.
An old scar?
Our new Constitution has renounced
war.
Who made us?
What?
You've changed.
My plans seemed like a revolt,
yet you said you'd be responsible.
Your former guts?
The 20 years after the war
gave us time to think.
Are you saying that Atragon is useless?
Who said so?
We need it... that's why we're here.
Atragon is not useless,
the world needs it.
I refuse!
You still don't understand?
I refuse!
I built Atragon for our Navy!
All has changed!
I'll change it again with Atragon!
Fool! Stop talking nonsense!
Nonsense?
You call patriotism nonsense?
Take a global point of view!
I'll devote my life to my country!
Makoto.
Makoto...
Why are you crying?
Do you hate me?
I shouldn't have come.
I was happier dreaming about you.
Please, Father...
Please, do as Mr. Kusumi says.
Makoto...
For 20 years I left you in other hands
and spent my time to rebuild Japan.
Don't you understand?
But you don't know how I feel.
Do you understand how a
child feels, orphaned by war?
Yes, I do!
No, you don't.
If you did, you would
work for world good.
Your way of thinking is
like the people of Mu.
I hate you for it.
Makoto.
I hate you!
I hate you! I hate you!
It's you.
You called me war crazy.
Yes, I did.
And one more thing.
More?
- A war crazy has got a deadly weapon.
- What!
You are a ghost wearing
rusty armor named patriotism.
A ghost?
I feel sorry for Makoto.
Excuse me.
Wait!
I've kept this close to me for 20 years.
Take care of her.
What are you doing?
I'll take you to the Mu Empire.
Let me go! Let me go!
Damn.
What are you up to, anyway?
Let go! I'm being kind!
Kind? Stop your joking!
You'll all blow up! I've set a bomb!
What are you saying?
Emergency! Emergency!
Hurry!
Commander, a bomb was set on the
dock!
- What? Who did it?
- The reporter, sir.
Halt!
Your Majesty, they are the prisoners
from our enemy, Atragon.
What shall we do?
Sacrifice them to Manda.
To Manda?
Manda will be delighted, I'm sure.
Manda!
Manda! Manda!
If Captain Jinguji doesn't listen to us,
you will be sacrificed to Manda.
Manda?
Open that window.
Well?
An iron pillar is on top of the hatch.
- Remove it! Hurry!
- Yes, sir.
- Cut it!
- Yes, sir.
Mr. Kusumi, a Mu troop has
appeared on Mt. Mihara!
From the crater, the radio said.
- What're police doing?
- Catch them!
Not as easy as thieves!
You take them!
We're the reconnaissance unit.
Have all climbers come down?
No, there are quite a few left.
Move forward!
What are those?
- They are flying saucers!
- No, they're not!
What are they?
Susumu, are you all right?
Thank you.
Mr. Shindo, is there any way to escape?
Even if there were,
it's the bottom of the sea.
So there is no use
in stealing these then.
Wait! What do you think they are?
Dynamite?
Special ones.
They have been using
gigantic rocks since antiquity.
It's called megalithic culture.
They are the powerful dynamite
used on those rocks.
I can't believe you stole them
and you are still alive.
It's terrible!
I think they will start attacking soon.
Manda!
Manda! Manda!
We warn you in the name of Mu.
People of the colonies!
Destroy the Atragon!
Return our colonies immediately!
It's the only way to
save yourselves from ruin!
Note February 10, 2400 hrs.
At first, the New York skyscrapers...
...and downtown Tokyo,
you will see our power there.
You will see what we just said
is no idle threat!
Not yet?
It's very hard, isn't it?
All right! Let's go down.
Check all parts!
<i>Bow, all in order!</i>
<i>Mid-section too!</i>
<i>Engine room too!</i>
<i>Stern too!</i>
Stand by!
All right.
But we're sealed in though.
You'll soon see.
- Stand by to start.
- Stand by to start.
- Start!
- Start!
Shall we go?
Go where?
I think I was wearing rusty armor.
I took it off and feel fine.
Jinguji!
Please contact HQ.
Atragon will now sail
to destroy the Mu Empire!
- All's quiet, sir.
- Good.
- We still have five minutes left. Be alert.
- Yes, sir.
HQ! Come in!
Roger!
Three Allied Army planes!
This is the fate of those
who defy the Mu Empire.
Atragon!
Defying our warnings, Jinguji?
Report it to our Empress!
They're escaping.
We'll follow to find their base!
- Touch down!
- Touch down!
- Open the vent.
- Open the vent.
- Depth 500.
- Depth 500.
Come out!
Become sacrifices to Manda!
Don't move! See this?
Understand? Move, and
the Mu Empire will blow up!
Open it!
Wear these water-tight suits.
What is that noise?
I don't know!
You, too, Your Majesty.
What? I refuse to go!
Taking you up to land.
No!
I'm letting in sea water.
Wait!
That's the entrance to the Mu Empire.
- Stop!
- Stop!
A monster!
- Open the hatch!
- Open the hatch!
Your father.
Father!
Makoto.
Uncle.
Fine. Fine.
The Mu Empress.
Jinguji, it's useless to defy us.
Do you think you can win?
You defy us!
Mu Empire will win!
We will rule the world.
Killing me cannot kill our Empire's
heart!
Empire's heart?
It's the power room using
terrestrial heat for Mu energy.
Where is it?
It's located at six miles below the
Palace.
That's right.
Give up and surrender!
We will attack as long as
you tell us to surrender!
But we'll listen to peace talks.
Impertinent!
Then we'll attack the
heart of the Mu Empire.
- Stand by and dive!
- Stand by and dive!
Dive!
Emergency light! Hurry!
High tension current!
- Cold Air Cannon! Stand by!
- Cold Air Cannon! Stand by!
- Fire!
- Fire!
Advance unit assemble! Hurry!
Salute.
The advance unit will leave, sir!
Start!
What? Atragon is in the power room?
Yes!
Fool! It can't be!
They're inferior to us! They can't
enter the power room from outside!
Absolutely not!
- Make sure to set the right time.
- Yes.
We did it!
Stand by to attack!
Stand by to attack!
Fire!
Fire!
Hey!
Let her go.
She knows she'll die yet
she's returning. Just let her go.
Susumi!
