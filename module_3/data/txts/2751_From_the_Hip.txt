( Alarm buzzes )
Come on, jo ann.
Let's get up.
Come on.
No.
Yes, wake up.
You said use
guerrilla tactics
if necessary.
Okay!
( Cassette rewinding )
This is phase one...
( tape plays
"stars and stripes forever )
...escalating
every 60 seconds.
Let's go.
( Knocking )
Jo ann, up.
Stay up.
( Music stops playing )
Okay,  jo ann,
here comes phase two!
You said you
wouldn't marry me
If i let you
oversleep.
Just remember,
this one's for love, babe.
( Screeching )
Ah! Not this!
You said this morning
was hypercritical--
Your words.
I was drunk.
You don't drink.
I must drink.
How else could i
Feel this way
in the morning?
Jo ann--
Okay,  phase three.
60 seconds
to phase three!
You won't like
phase three.
Come on, jo ann.
I've got something important
to talk to you about anyway,
Seriously.
I'm about to compromise
my values, i think.
( Ice tray crackling )
I'm going to do something
That some people might
construe as unethical.
Well, sort of
a little bit unethical.
I mean, not unethical,
really,
Just opportunistic,
Self-Promoting
more than unethical.
I just can't stand
this waiting.
I want to get at it.
I want to practice law.
That's what i've
wanted all my life.
When other kids were
playing cowboys and indians,
I was playing
plaintiff and defendant.
I want to go to trial.
I want to object
and be sustained,
I want to pace up and down,
waive my arms, bang on tables,
And be overruled
and all that lawyer stuff.
Are you listening?
Um-Hmm...
you know what
we always talked about?
You as earth mother
Between acting
and modeling jobs,
Looking after crippled kids
and abandoned old folks,
Me defending migrant
farm workers--
You know, fruit pickers?
Are there fruit pickers
in massachusetts?
Are you listening?
- Jo ann?
- Hmm?
- Jo ann.
- Hmm?
You haven't heard
a word i've said.
Mm-Hmm.
Well, are you
listening now?
- Mm-Hmm.
- Good, because--
I got a phone call
this morning,
Well, it seems i've been
awarded the nobel prize
for jurisprudence,
And while harvard law school
wants to have me bronzed
And hung out over the library--
Do you think i should do it?
Um-Hmm...
and a big dinosaur
jumped on my head,
And i caught on fire
and was running around naked
With feathers
in my ears!
Should i do that?
- Mmm.
- Oh.
Hypercritical,
you said.
Oh! Oh!
Robin! Oh, god!
Come back here,
you coward!
Oh, god.
Oh. 7 a.M!
Why didn't you wake me?
( Knocking )
Hey!
Jesus, steve.
What are you doing?
- What areyoudoing?
- Nothing.
Just seeing if
duncan was in.
How come you're
here early?
I'm catching up.
Filing, proofreading--
Are we still on
for lunch?
We've got to be back
for roberta's party
at 1:30.
A half an hour to eat?
We'd better order ahead
for that pork tartare.
How many of those
are you going to eat?
They're good for you.
Increase that staying power.
No, oysters, steve.
Those are clams.
Oh.
They're wet and slimy.
What's the difference?
You should try some.
What for?
I can't get a date.
I can't get near a girl.
I can't get near anyone.
If i were a tree,
dogs wouldn't
piss on me.
I had an imaginary
playmate once.
He liked you.
Naw, he used to beat
the shit out of me.
( Laughs )
What's the matter
with you?
I can't take it
anymore.
Every day it's
research, file--
Robin,
nobody tries cases
Their first year
out of law school.
We work harder than
anyone in that firm.
Nobody notices.
I've got to do something
to get their attention.
Roberta's birthday party.
Let's move.
No, i can't.
I got to work.
That's a great way
to get their attention--
Ignore a senior partner's
birthday party.
We're going, babe.
- Roberta hates me.
- Roberta hates everybody.
- All women hate me.
- They're right.
( Employees singing )
? The old gray mare ?
? She ain't
what she used to be ?
? Ain't what
she used to be ?
? Ain't what
she used to be ?
? The old gray mare ?
? She ain't what
she used to be ?
? Many long years ago. ?
Speech, speech.
God, it looks like
the chicago fire.
( Employees laugh )
I know meticulousness
is a virtue for lawyers,
But do we have to be
quite so unerring
In the candle count?
Make a wish.
It's never too late.
No!
You listen to me,
you roach,
You tell that client
of yours
That if he's not
off the premises
By noon tomorrow,
I will not only
sue him,
But i will send a 300-Pound
thumb-Breaker down there
To buff-Dry
the vaseline plaster
To the little
greaseball's head!
Baloney,
the guy's greasier
than zorro's hatband.
So, you tell
that little hangnail
To scribble out
a check!
And it better be good,
Because the only thing
that i want to see bounce
Is that
little weasel's butt
Right out
of the building!
Bye!
Cindy, will you get me--
Oh, i'm sorry.
Could you hear that?
Hear it?
You blew the candles out.
What was that?
That was a tenant.
He won't vacate.
You haven't had him
guillotined yet?
I'm sorry.
I guess i was
a little overzealous.
- Happy birthday.
- Not at all.
We enjoyed it,
Particularly the part
about zorro's hatband.
That's a very original
term in jurisprudence.
It's negotiation
as art form.
I'm very sorry.
It was very
industrious.
All right,
cake for everyone,
Then noses back
in your briefs--
You'll forgive
the expression.
And thank you all
very much.
Sir.
Who's the hungriest
person here?
Cindy,
she carried the cake.
You slick
son of a bitch.
- "Zorro's hatband"?
- That just came to me.
Roberta's nostrils
flared, i swear.
Desperation
is my middle name.
Weathers!
Come on.
- Weathers, damn it,
-You want me?
The torkenson trial
is tomorrow.
Why wasn't i
notified?
- I sent you a memo.
- No, you didn't.
- Did you check your box?.
- Of course, i did!
You didn't send it to me,
that's what.
- Sir, i did.
- No, you didn't.
- All right, find it.
- It has to be here.
You never sent it.
What about
these files here?
That's another case.
Maybe it's mixed up
in that stuff.
You're mixed up.
Just admit you didn't send it.
What's this?
Here it is, see?
Dated june 12th,
last week.
How did that
get down there?
"Trial, june 19th."
"No continuance."
We're screwed.
What's the matter?
The torkenson trial
is tomorrow,
There's no continuance,
and i've never seen
the files.
- I can try it!
- You can try it?
What's it about?
Our client
punched someone,
And he's being sued
for $50,000.
I know the case.
I can try it.
It's a pimple.
Let him try it.
What choice
do we have?
Our client is
a bank president.
- I can do it.
- He can do it.
Phil, be serious.
He's a kid.
Go with him and
hold his hand.
You can do it.
- Yes, sir.
- Good boy.
- Good god.
- Thank you, sir.
Good luck.
Ha ha ha!
You didn't?
Tell me you didn't.
Okay, i didn't.
You did.
You stonewalled duncan
on his own court date.
You'll wind up
on the supreme court
or in san quentin.
Maybe i shouldn't
have done it.
Maybe
i shouldn't have.
It was unethical,
wasn't it?
Are you serious?
You heard ames.
It's a pimple.
I'm sorry i didn't
think of it myself.
Ah, you're right.
It's a great case.
I got a great game plan.
I can't lose.
I've got to call jo ann.
Are you guys
jumping again?
Are you?
Hi, sweetheart.
Mrs. Jameson,
would you take
the kids
For a few minutes?
I'd appreciate it.
Silly, isn't he?
Silly.
Would you believe
some of these kids
couldn't talk
When we got them,
And they're closing
this program down.
More of
the right wing's war
Against wasteful
social programming.
I think you'd
like to give up
the acting
And do this stuff
full time.
I can only have
my heart broken
a few hours a day.
I've got something
for you.
- What?
- It's for your collection.
- It's a new don wright.
- Mm-Hmm.
- Ha ha ha ha!
- You like it?
Oh, yeah!
This is an original.
Oh, man.
- Duncan?
- Yup.
- You happy?
- Oh, yeah.
I'm going to
get it framed.
So, tell me
about the case.
Can't.
I don't want to be
late for my meeting
With my first client.
Your place or mine?
Mine.
There's a slight
problem with your bed.
Your side of the bed.
What did you do?
You didn't think
i would let you
Get away with
this morning?
I was just
following orders.
Yeah, that's what
hitler's boys said.
What did you do
to my bed?
I kind of tarred
and feathered it.
You tarred
and feathered my bed?
With honey
and saltines.
- You're sick.
- I'll undo it.
Now that you're
a litigator,
You get a break.
I love you.
I'll see you.
"I get to pace
up and down
And wave my arms
and pound on tables"?
Robin?
We don't have
very much time,
So let's discuss
your defense.
There's no defense.
I struck the man.
Excuse me?
It's a loser.
Just drag it out.
I'm not sure
that i follow.
I want at least
a three day trial.
Run up his fees.
He may get $50,000,
But i want it
to cost him $20,000.
Three days?
It's a one day case.
Stretch it out.
That's all i ask.
Shouldn't we try
to win?
I like your spirit.
God knows i love a fight.
But, sir,
i can win it.
You can't win it.
Trust me.
I hit people
all the time. I know.
See you in court.
Great.
It's just because
of tomorrow.
Probably.
Will you still
marry me?
What?
This could be serious.
Robin, you're just
preoccupied.
I'm a lawyer.
What kind of marriage
will we have if trials
make me impotent?
( Jo ann laughs )
I think
you'll recover.
Do you think
i was wrong,
How i got the case?
It was a close call.
Some people would
call it "initiative."
What wouldyou
call it?
Creative sneakiness.
I've got to make
my own breaks, jo ann.
I didn't exactly finish
at the top of my class.
You never even
met your class.
You went
to three lectures
in three years,
And you
still finished
in the top 10%.
You're going to be
great tomorrow,
just great.
But the point is,
i'm supposed to be
Calm, collected,
and commanding.
I am a lawyer.
Here i am lying in bed
scared completely stiff.
Well...
not completely.
Jerk.
Ha ha ha!
Oh, god.
Laugh, go ahead, laugh.
It's a really
funny joke.
Attorney:
objection! He's groping,
your honor.
Judge:
a little grope
never hurt anybody.
Overruled.
Continue,
mr. Weathers.
No further questions
at this time,
your honor.
How's he doing?
I don't know,
but he's having
a great time.
Good.
What are you doing?
I don't want
duncan to see me.
I should be working.
( Steve snickering )
Mr. Cowens, if we're
not bothering you...
yes, sir.
Let me get this
straight.
The plaintiff,
a trustee,
Criticized your bank's
lending policy
After a board
meeting?
That's correct.
So--
So you punched him?
I struck him
because he was rude.
He called me
an idiot.
But he never physically
threatenedyou,did he?
No.
And there was
no skirmish
Preceding your act
of violence?
No.
- Do you mind?
- No, sir.
You just felt
like hitting him,
So you did,
isn't that right?
I suppose so.
No further questions,
your honor.
Redirect,
mr. Weathers?
Yes, your honor.
Mr. Torkenson,
how long have you known
The plaintiff,
mr. Wilby?
Approximately
12 years.
Over that duration,
did you have an opportunity
To form an opinion
as to the character
of the plaintiff?
I did.
Could you, please,
state that opinion?
You mean what
i really think?
Your honest opinion.
He's an asshole.
-Objection!
- You bet.
Sustained. The answer
will be stricken.
Sidebar,
your honor.
What for?
Because i want
a sidebar.
I respectfully request
the answer be allowed.
- What?
- It should stand.
It is relevant.
And it's offensive.
Don't compound it.
If i may--
Tell the witness
to rephrase the answer.
That just it,
he can't.
The word has
a very distinct
connotation.
Nothing else
quite captures it.
I object.  Are you saying
a president of a bank
Can't articulate his thoughts
without using profanity?
What i'm saying is
there aren't many
words to describe
The particular slime
your client oozes.
Objection!
Mr. Weathers,
where do you
think you are?
In a place
where every citizen
can have his say.
Not in any way
he wants to say it.
Tell him to pick
another word.
Deceitful?
Dishonest?
Conniving?
- They're all close...
- Objection!
...but "asshole"
really fits.
It's the only word
that accurately
describes him,
And we can
demonstrate that.
Everybody thinks
he's an asshole.
- Son of a bitch.
- That's good, too.
- Shut up!
- What the hell?
Court's adjourned.
In my chambers--
Now!
Duncan--
Urf! Uf! Uff! Uff!
What kind
of horseshit is this?
- I'm sorry, your honor--
- Excuse me, sir,
But you know
as well as i do
That the word
has a unique meaning,
And my client has
a right to expression.
Change the word.
Fine.
Give me one word
That captures
the same inference.
You name it
and i will use it.
Sure.
Can you come up
with a word?
Sure... uh...
antagonistic?
Antagonistic?
You're making
defense's point
for him.
I still object.
I move for a hearing
on the matter.
You want me to have
a special motion
On the admissibility
of the word "asshole?"
Let me have "ass."
That's close enough.
What law school
did you attend?
- I'll agree to it.
- You will? Why?
I don't want any
interlocutory appeals.
What are you,
a comedy team?
All right!
We'll hear it
tomorrow--
Just "ass" though.
We'll bring the jury
back on thursday.
That's okay
with me.
Oh, good!
What's this snotnose
doing in my court?
You were scheduled
for this trial,
duncan.
We had a trial
runover.
Um-Hm.
I'll tell you what--
I'm holding you
responsible for
his behavior.
He steps
out of line again,
I'll hold you
in contempt.
- Me?
- Yeah, you!
It's going
on your record!
Any questions?
Good. Get out.
Uh... uh...
wait a minute--
Get out!
Lunatic, moron,
cretin.
We'll have to change
the name of the firm
To "sleaze, sleaze,
and pander."
Balls.
Well, you got
your three days.
I love it.
Hee-Hee-Hee!
He's screaming
at the judge,
Yelling, fighting--
And i'm going to be
charged with contempt.
They're really
going to have
that motion?
Oh, yes!
They're going
to argue over
the word "ass."
Can you imagine such
language in a court of law?
That boy's got balls,
i'll give him that much.
No brains,
but industrial-Sized--
Roberta:
then geld him.
Give the kid
some credit.
He's parleyed
a little tort case
Into a first amendment
battle.
He's demonstrated
a willingness
To embarrass this firm.
There's no telling
how low he'll stoop.
Duncan:
i know how low...
robin...
what are you doing?
Just the man i need.
We've got to
collect some books.
Robin:
the word appears
in all kinds of literature,
From dictionaries
to sonnets.
Look at these books--
Shakespeare,
Dickens,
hemingway,
George bernard shaw,
james joyce,
Lawrence,
both d.H. And t.E.,
Freud,
Faulkner,
Chaucer,
But it's not good enough
for mr. Cowens.
He doesn't like it.
"Too harsh."
Mr. Weathers,
Please come out.
And face unpleasantries?
Oh, i'll bruise.
Mr. Weathers,
This court orders you
to come out.
I'll come out,
your honor,
To face reality.
But i won't stay out
If you let
plaintiff's counsel
Turn this courtroom
Into a fortress
of censorship.
( Laughing )
( Torkenson laughs harder )
The swell of obscenity
is everywhere.
Vulgarity has permeated
almost every walk of life,
But here,
the courtroom of america
Has stood to stem
the filthy tide
Of man-Made decadence.
This place,
where years of integrity,
Honesty,
and dedication culminate
For the few who earn
the right to wear that robe--
And be addressed
as--
Pfffft!
Objection!
( Courtroom laughs )
I object to this
groveling drivel.
First he objects
to the word "ass,"
And now, your honor,
he's kissing yours.
This is grounds
for disbarment!
How can you stand
this clown?
You're going to
be disbarred.
Grow up!
( Shouting; gavel pounding )
I'm going to
get disbarred?
Mr. Weathers!
Mr. Weathers!
( Judge whistling )
Hey!
That's it, counselor.
That gets him
a contempt order.
Be sure you spell
his name right,
D-U-N-C-A-N.
In my chambers.
Weathers!
You're fired.
You're finished.
If you fire him,
You'll lose our bank
and our three subsidiaries.
I'll see
you never represent
Another
lending institution
in this state.
He's great.
Great?
Are you serious?
You bet, asshole.
Reporter:attorneys
robin "stormy" weathers
And matt cowens
almost came to fisticuffs
In what some insiders
have described
As the most brilliant
legal engagement in years.
The only question is,
will they kill each other
Before we get
a verdict?
We fire him,
we lose the bank.
We have to fire him.
We have our reputation.
Neither means anything
without our clients.
We need that bank,
Not to mention
we've had inquiries
From four major firms
due to mr. Weathers.
What?
One client
cannot be worth
An institution's
integrity.
For the love of god,
craig, control him.
I can't.
He's not afraid of me,
The little shit.
I don't know why
the judge puts up with it.
He loves it,
loves it.
He's been sitting
in civil court
for 30 dull years.
He gets off on it!
I won't have it, phil.
It cannot continue.
Wait a minute.
Aren't we losing
sight of something?
This cowens kid is good.
He's very good.
Weathers has
a no-Win case.
He'll lose.
After he loses,
Torkenson's passions
will cool,
And then we'll quietly
can the little bastard.
Weathers:
now, mr. Wilby,
Do you recall saying
anything to the defendant
On the morning
of the day in question?
I, um...
i don't remember.
But you did
speak to him?
I speak to him
every morning.
About what?
It could be
most anything.
Did you tell him
you wanted to have
A sexual encounter
with his grandmother?
- ( Courtroom laughs )
- Objection!
He said "anything."
Ah-- That's contempt order
number two.
Charge it to him.
Mr. Weathers,
do you desire another?
Sure.
What does he care?
Why is it he can remember
the afternoon conversation
Word for bloody word,
But for the morning,
he's stuck for a topic?
- Because i wrote it down.
- What?
I wrote
the conversation down.
- Where?
- In my journal!
- Is that how you remember?
- Yes, it is!
- Do you have that book here?
- It's right over there.
- I want that book!
- Objection!
The law is clear,
present recollection refreshed.
Produce the book.
What?
He can read it?
All of it?
Every smut-Filled page,
you disgusting worm.
- Objection!
- Objection!
Oh, that's novel.
Objection in two
part harmony.
Nope, too late.
That's it, counselor.
Contempt order
number three.
He keeps this up,
maybe i can give you life.
I move for
a suppression hearing.
- Absolutely not!
- Objection!
- Judge: you shut up!
- You have to show cause!
You don't have
a damn thing!
- Holy cow.
- He's your client!
You obviously
didn't prepare him!
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
What did
duncan say?
Duncan has stopped
talking to me.
He had his eyes closed
the whole time.
We should
just take all this
circumstantial material
And just create
whatever inferences we can.
Sure, truth be damned.
Truth?
What's she
talking about?
This is law.
You're really
going to marry
This rabble-Rouser?
( Making barking noise )
Jo ann,
There's something
i've got to ask you.
If i win this trial,
try not to embarrass me.
What do you mean?
Remember in law school
when i won that mock trial
-You started screaming?
- No.
And whistling
and turning cartwheels?
One cartwheel.
And then you mooned
the prosecuting attorney.
I did not.
One cheek, perhaps.
This is
the big time,
So please try and
temper your emotions.
I'm going to
boo and hiss
And then i'm going
to moon the attorney
for the defense.
Moon me later, okay?
Isn't he cute?
I will not allow my client
to be embarrassed!
Shut up! Shut up!
I don't
really care!
Shut up!
The question's closed.
He can use the book
to impeach,
But, mr. Weathers,
you better stick to
The facts of this case.
Nothing that doesn't
concern this case
is admissible.
If you breathe one
irrelevant excerpt,
I'll throw you in jail
until you rot!
You got that?
Rot!
- Yes, your honor.
- You're positive?
- Positive, sir.
- You're absolutely positive?
- Absolutely positive.
- Very well, proceed.
Now, mr. Wilby,
I've read your journal.
Tell me, do you enjoy
molesting little girls?
- What?
- Judge: lock him up!
Duncan, right now!
And muzzle him.
Get one of those
dog things!
You better have
a good-Faith basis
for this question,
Or this trial
is over.
I'll direct a verdict
for the plaintiff,
And you'll never
practice law again!
- But, your honor--
- In my chambers now!
How'd you like
this gavel tattooed
to your forehead?
Please read
this top paragraph.
I don't want to.
You have to read it.
Please.
"I think i pressured her
into doing something
"She wasn't ready to do.
I forced her."
August 1956?
That's teenage sex,
for god's sake--
Those statements
suggest rape.
- You're out of your mind!
- He says he forced a girl
to have sex.
He may have
committed a crime.
If he was convicted
then it is relevant
Because the rules
of evidence state
That every conviction
bears relevance
Upon the credibility
of any witness who
takes the stand.
That is the law.
I'll be damned.
Snotnose
grows up, huh?
Cowens:
violence begets violence!
So i say to you,
make him pay.
Show him
and everyone else like him
That unprovoked violence
has a price,
And that price is
justice.
That's all i ask--
Justice.
Thank you.
Judge:
counselor?
This is stupid.
All of this because
one banker guy hits another.
It's called "battery,"
defined as
"An offensive touching."
Now, ladies
and gentlemen,
You have to decide
what's offensive.
A man calls you
an "idiot"
In front of your peers--
That's offensive.
A man gets slapped,
doesn't even get a scratch
And he wants
a $50,000 band-Aid.
That's offensive.
Think about suzie walker,
A little girl whose
whole body was burned
When a boiler exploded.
Think about a little
eight-Year-Old girl
Who never got one penny
for her crippling injuries
Because she died
before her case came to trial.
The man is totally
without shame.
Then think
of all the frivolous,
Meaningless cases
in which nobody gets hurt
That fill up the courts
So that the suzie walkers
never get there.
Objection!
The man got slapped,
and he wants $50,000!
That's offensive!
You should
get slapped.
For that kind of money--
Beat me.
Suzie walker
got nothing.
Cowens:
who the hell
is suzie walker?
That's his attitude.
"Who the hell
is suzie walker"?
Who the hell
gives a damn about her?
Who the hell
gives a damn
About crippled,
dying children?
That is
offensive!
Now, think about it.
That man
did not get hurt.
He has wasted
the court's time.
He's taken up
a week of your life.
Everyone always
says how terrible
the court system is
Because it takes literally
years to get a trial date.
Well, you wonder why.
He wants $50,000,
And he can't even
show you a bruise!
I say, don't
give it to him!
Tell this guy "no,"
And maybe the next guy
won't try it!
Send a message!
There's a long line of guys
just like him
Waiting for their chance
to roll the dice.
You tell them their place
is in atlantic city,
Not in the courtrooms
of america!
( Jo ann claps )
Judge:
has the jury reached
a verdict?
Woman:
yes, your honor,
we have.
What say you,
madam foreman?
Your honor,
we the jury,
Acting in accordance
with the laws
Of the commonwealth
of massachusetts,
Find for the defendant,
raymond torkenson--
Whoo!
( Courtroom cheering )
Son of a bitch.
Some guy just said
i'm going to be
on national tv.
Don't squint because
your eyes disappear
when you squint.
And you'll be eyeless
on national television.
Was that spectacular?
I think you're
going to have to give
Some serious thought
to making that boy
a partner.
It'd be good
for business.
Just thought
you might want
to think about it.
They were wrong.
You're the asshole.
( Bizet's "march
of the toreadors" playing )
Double time.
And backwards!
( Music stops )
It's your client's party.
It's in your honor.
Have a little dignity.
( Guys laugh )
( Waltz plays )
What is that?
( Applause )
Ta-Da!
And they said
the man couldn't dance.
And they were right.
Sir. Sir.
Where's
your date?
She couldn't
make it.
- Got stood up.
- I got stood up.
Oh-Hh...
i told you
i was a lonely guy.
Steve:
hey, is that cowens?
- Robin:what's he doing here?
- Larry:i don't know.
I invited him.
You're both good lawyers.
You did yourself proud.
He's got as much cause
to celebrate as you do.
Anyhow, i know
you're both professionals.
You won't let
your differences
Affect a social
gathering.
On the other hand,
maybe they'll slug it out.
Welcome!
There's a friend
of yours.
Are you lost?
It's a party.
I was invited.
This party is in honor
of you being whipped.
The only thing
whipped around here
Is your reputation.
The client used you.
He'll hire me next
As soon as you
get disbarred.
Eh?
Robin!
Why don't you tell
the bimbo to take a hike?
- That's it!
- Let's go.
It's not worth it,
robin.
Stay back!
It's between us!
In the boathouse.
Robin?
We have to stop them.
Let them get it out
of their system.
They won't
hurt each other.
Well?
Well, what?
Well, this,
you windbag.
- We did it.
- We did it.
We did it.
We did it.
We did it.
We did it!
( Laughing )
Did you see the look
on the judge's face
When i asked
for a hearing
On the admissibility
of the word "asshole"?
Wait.
We're supposed to
be fighting.
Make some noise.
Do something.
What are they doing?
They're probably
talking it out.
Maybe not.
( Laughing )
Let them figure
that one out.
I can't believe this.
This isn't robin.
We fixed a trial.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
We did not
fix a trial.
All we did was stage
the presentation.
We gave the jury
the true facts,
And they could have
gone either way.
All we did was
tell each other
What we were going
to do and say.
You're right.
( Laughing )
They think we're
the fastest-Talkin',
Quickest-Thinkin',
Baddest-Assed lawyers
in the world!
Aah!
Destruction.
- ( Clanging )
- Both: ow!
Ow! That hurts!
( Crashing )
I love this kind
of human interaction.
Are you ready
for this?
I've got
an interview monday.
For what?
For the assistant
d.A. Job.
( Crashing )
I'm going
down there.
They're coming.
Robin:
cowens!
Both: you asshole!
It's okay.
It's okay.
He gave up.
You son of a bitch!
He put up
a hell of a fight.
You kicked his ass twice.
I love it!
Does he know
how to swim?
Torkenson:
i told you that boy
was partner material.
I thought we were
going to wax his ass.
- We agreed to fire him.
- That's what we voted to do.
Famous or not,
the man's a blight
on our very existence.
I will no longer allow
a born-Again punk
To degrade the reputation
of this firm.
He's finished.
We shall not waver
From the only
sound decision
To waft from these walls
in the past month.
Warren, tell them.
Based upon projections
from the new clients
That robin weathers
has brought in to date,
The average earnings
of each partner
Will increase this year
by $28,000-$32,000.
- I'm delighted.
- Thank you, sir.
I'm sure you can imagine
how excited we all are
To have you
as a partner.
I appreciate that,
and i hope i live up
to your expectation.
I palpitate
at the thought.
Thank you.
If you'll excuse me now,
I'm meeting the decorator
about the new office.
? For he's
a jolly good fellow ?
? For he's
a jolly good fellow ?
? For he's
a jolly good fellow ?
? Which nobody can deny... ?
- Thank god he's dead.
- Who?
Oliver wendell holmes,
who founded this firm.
He's been dead
50 years.
The longer,
the better.
Let's not
get carried away.
He's a partner now,
and that's that.
"Stormy weathers."
Couldn't we at least
put an asterisk
beside his name?
You have a great deal
to answer for.
A good litigator
is never without
an answer.
Miss jenson,
bring it in, please.
And this is?
The benoit case.
We decided to turn down
the benoit case.
Duncan:
yes, we did.
Why?
Unwinnable.
The man was caught
with the murder weapon
And the victim's
bloodstained clothes
Under the seat
of his car.
Exactly. Unwinnable.
Diabolical.
It stinks.
Yes, it does.
Not only that--
At the prospect
of being represented
By the incendiary
mr. Weathers,
Professor benoit
was easily induced
Into plunking down
a retainer of $75,000.
Craig,
Have you any idea
how cynical this is?
What about
our obligation
to the client?
Oh, yes.
Actually, i've taken
a bit more credit
than i deserve.
Benoit wants him.
He doesn't
want anybody else.
You told him
the boy's one year
out of law school
With one trial?
If the little weasel
starts to sink,
I'll bail him out.
Well, i still
don't like it.
What none of you
wants to admit it
is the kid's good.
We'll see.
- You know the benoit case?
- The b.U. Doctor?
- I am defending him!
- What?
- You heard it, me.
- Why?
They're setting me up!
It's a complete no-Win!
It's a great chance.
You should be thrilled.
There could be
a death penalty.
- Not for the lawyer.
- Funny.
Maybe i can get him
to confess, or plead guilty.
Wouldn't that be
in violation
Of his mandate
as defense attorney?
- Somewhat.
- Um-Hmm.
Why you?
How strange
you should ask that.
Let me explain something
to you, mr. Weathers.
Through the vicissitudes
Of wholly gratuitous
genetic accidents,
I was visited with extremely
high intelligence.
I was further blessed,
or burdened, as it were,
With certain
physical traits
That would suggest,
good breeding.
Now, in this
proletarian stew,
Which today
we laughingly call society,
These attributes are not
always advantageous.
You, on the other hand,
Are the current messiah
of the blue-Collar,
The people's choice,
A sort of pissed-Off
abe lincoln.
My story, which,
by the way, is true,
Will be better served
if you tell it.
You have to realize
i'm a creation of the media.
I've only tried one case
in my entire career,
And a murder case
is a very complex beast.
Modesty is a banal
and self-Serving device.
It really
doesn't become you.
And don't patronize me.
I have
no tolerance for it.
Say what you mean,
this case can't be won.
I said what i meant.
I don't have the years
of experience needed
To recognize the traps
and tricks that can
sway a verdict.
Scott murray is acting
for the prosecution.
I'm not being modest
when i say i may be
in over my head.
Nonsense.
I was there.
It was very impressive.
There?
Come, come, come.
Don't be so slow.
The torkenson case.
Yes.
You were remarkably
intuitive.
That was a simple
assault case.
This is just
a simple assault case
With somewhat
more dire results.
If you equate
a bloody nose
With a hammer claw
through the brain.
A matter
of degree only.
You have the gift.
It was uncanny how you
anticipated every move,
Turned every subtlety
to your advantage.
But most important
of all,
They liked you.
You have
the common touch.
They wanted you to win
and they were looking
For any reason
to give you that win.
That is what i need.
That is what
i have paid for,
And according
to your superiors,
That is
what i will get.
Larry:
what a sweetheart.
Sort of a cross between
Charles manson
and william buckley.
My god, i can hear
my opening statement now:
"I know my client
had a motive,
Had opportunity,
was caught with
the murder weapon
And the victim's
bloodstained clothes,
And is a superior,
obnoxious, elitist swine,
Who makes you want
to throw up,
But you'll have to
overlook all that."
Don't underestimate
yourself.
Based on your work
in the torkenson trial,
Benoit's life's
in good hands.
We've got to get
back to work.
Jo ann?
Jo ann?
Jo ann?
I'm in a bit
of trouble.
I don't know
how to tell you.
That's why i'm telling you
while you're asleep.
You know
how i got the trial,
But what you don't know
Is that cowens and i
set up the trial, too.
I don't want to
exaggerate what we did.
We didn't bribe the judge
or the jury
Or rig the trial,
But we conspired
to make ourselves look good.
"Conspired."
I mean, that wasn't
what we thought
we were doing,
But anyway,
We set each other up
So we could both
be heroes.
I'm not excusing
anything,
But i thought
It was more
of a misdemeanor
than a felony.
No harm, no foul,
you know?
You still asleep?
Anyway,
Afterwards
i felt really low,
Mostly because
i knew you would be
Disappointed in me,
But i thought,
"nah, just go on.
Be a good guy,
And everything
will be all right,"
But now i've been
given a murder trial,
And you know why?
Because the client
saw me
In the torkenson case,
And he wants me
Because i was
so brilliant.
I just feel
like such a fraud
Because
the torkenson trial,
It seemed
like a game show.
High theater,
hi-Jinks.
Now this thing
comes along.
It's almost
biblical,
But, jo ann,
i got to tell you,
I love it--
The limelight,
the attention,
Being on national tv.
I'm shocked.
I'm a junkie.
I don't have to
take the case,
Not really,
But i just want to.
I always
thought of myself
as an idealist,
But maybe
i love glory more.
Well--
It's been nice
talking to you.
You're a good listener.
Oh, robin.
Unfortunately,
it doesn't matter
That her body
was never found.
Brain tissue was
all over her jacket.
Somebody's dead,
and the jury will be
Willing to believe
that it's liza williams.
Please, let's go over
your story one more time.
Shall i say it
in hebraic this time?
Or maybe latin?
They do still teach
latin in law school?
Actually, yes.
Tell him the latin
for "pain in the ass."
"Vox hemorrhoidum?"
Very good.
That plebeian wit
will serve us well.
Keep it up.
All right, again.
Liza williams was
a call girl in my employ.
She was blackmailing me.
She disappeared.
Her bloodstained clothes
And the murder weapon,
a hammer,
Were found in my car.
I have no alibi.
And we were heard
arguing the night
she disappeared.
Do you ever
listen to yourself?
What does this add up to?
I'm telling you this
for the last time!
You're talking
about a guilty plea.
To manslaughter--
There's a reduced sentence.
- Don't waste my time!
- You don't seem--
I don't understand!
Is that what you
were about to say?
Yes.
I understand
Every fiber
of every
little twitch
Of every
little neuron
In that sly
little mind of yours.
Don't ever tell me
that i don't understand.
I know
what you're thinking
before you think it.
I understand
the ultimate conclusion
To every one of these
legal peregrinations.
Did you think i hadn't
thought all of this out?
Did you think i was going
to leave it all to you?
Don't make me laugh.
I know this case can't
be won on the evidence.
Substance is not on our side,
despite my innocence.
Style...
is what will
win this case.
And that is why
you are here.
Do you know
what you're like?
You are like
one of those cute
performing seals
That plays
little tunes on horns.
They're adorable,
everybody loves them,
But do you think
anybody cares
what they play?
No. They just
love to see them
Blow their
little horns.
You go out and start
blowing your little horns.
Is this your version
of a pep talk?
Very good.
I'm impressed.
I am impressed.
Understand one thing,
and we'll get along
very well.
When i say something,
i don't want an argument.
Just do it.
There will be
no plea bargain.
Who is luther moses?
Liza's pimp.
He's disappeared.
Ah!
Yes, now you're thinking.
He knew that she
was blackmailing others
As well as me.
He used to accuse her
of holding out.
He had motive
and opportunity.
Demonstrate to the jury
That he's just as likely
a suspect as i am.
Why else
has he disappeared?
You tell me.
And what
does that mean?
Isn't it true
that you had
Several altercations
with moses?
- We had an argument.
- You had a bloody fist fight
- And he beat you senseless!
- That is ridiculous!
He humiliated you,
and you hated his guts!
What are you
talking about?
Nobody ever beat me
in my life!
Two people
saw that beating,
Liza williams
and her mother!
He beat you, benoit.
He humbled you
in front of them,
And you hated him,
and you killed him,
And that's why
he's disappeared!
I presume
you were taking
The part
of the prosecutor?
Of course.
Your point
is well taken.
Since we cannot use
mr. Moses' disappearance,
You will never mention
mr. Moses to me again.
Never.
What a warm guy.
He'll make
a great witness.
Not thinking
of jumping,
are we?
Nah. There's
a celtics game
tomorrow night.
I'll jump friday.
- Tough day, huh?
- Tough life.
Ooh, that's heavy.
Do you want
to talk?
If i knew
where to start.
Wait a sec.
I can help.
Okay.
Go ahead, talk.
( Snoring )
You heard it all,
didn't you?
- Yes, i did.
- What do you think?
I think this is
a revolutionary
Therapeutic technique
we've developed here.
This kind of counseling
ain't cheap.
All right.
Give me
a quarter's worth.
A quarter's worth?
Don't i get some
kind of a discount?
Yeah, for a quarter,
my advice is to jump.
What did you want
for a quarter?
I want you to tell me
i'm right.
I can't do that.
I can tell you
that i love you.
I can tell you
that i understand.
I can tell you that
you're one of a kind,
And that you got
a good heart.
But i can't tell you
that you're right.
You think i'm wrong?
Of course
you were wrong.
Don't come to me
for absolution.
I'm not your mother
or a priest.
I'm your lover.
You'd have to come up
just short of murder
For me not
to support you.
But you can't ask me
to make it right.
Just go out there
and be a good guy.
It's all that
i can tell you.
Fair?
Fair.
Are you going
to take the case?
Yes.
- Is he guilty?
- He says not.
They all say not.
That's why they all
have to be defended.
That's justice.
Yeah, with all
the justice there is
in our legal system,
You might as well
play "spin the bottle."
Whoever it
points to wins.
Sorry.
Ugh!
That's great!
You've just invalidated
my entire existence.
I think i'll jump.
No, there's a celtics
game tomorrow night.
All i'm saying is--
Look at all
that we've got.
I just feel like
we should be giving
some of it back.
I'm not saying
that we should be
saints or martyrs.
I would just like
to land somewhere
Between mother teresa
and imelda marcos.
Sorry.
All right.
You're right.
We'll be the first
yuppie missionaries,
With all the shoes
we can eat.
It's queer.
It's really dumb.
I love you,
you know?
I know.
It keeps me going.
Candy meade,
benoit's former mistress.
Can't find her.
She's married
and relocated.
We've got to find her.
We can't allow the jury
to believe for a second
That benoit's capable
of that kind of violence.
If he ever hit candy,
that's it, we're through.
Put another
detective on it.
Did you talk
to benoit's wife?
She's actually
very supportive.
How is benoit?
It was one
of his good days.
Warm, charming--
You could actually
put him on the stand
If he showed
that side of himself.
The guy is a chameleon.
I can't get a fix on him.
( Tarzan yell )
Do i have
your attention?
Sit down.
- I found him!
- Who?
A pathologist--
Dr. C.R. Peckham.
He's willing to state
that based on
The blood sample
from her jacket,
Liza williams died
more than a week
After she was seen
with benoit.
That is great!
Peckham's one of the best.
He's gonna be good
on the stand, too.
He's firm, feisty,
sense of humor.
That blows
murray's pathologist
right out of the water.
All we've got to do
is keep murray
From painting benoit
as a violent womanizer.
- Anything we missed?
- I don't see how.
We even impaneled
a good jury.
We've been over
everything 10 times.
I think we're ready.
We're ready.
We're ready.
We're ready.
Clerk:
all rise!
Bailiff:
hear ye, hear ye.
Lions and tigers
and bears, oh, my!
All ye who have business
before the superior court
In and of the county
of suffolk
In the commonwealth
of massachusetts draw near.
Give your attention
and ye shall be heard.
Be seated.
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a long way to go,
so let's get to it.
Mr. Murray,
mr. Weathers.
We had reasonable decorum
in the pre-Trial hearings.
I'd like
to see that continue.
Bring the jury in,
please.
Judge:
is the commonwealth
ready to open?
Murray:
we are, your honor.
And the defendant's
counsel, are you ready?
Yes, your honor.
Very well.
Mr. Murray,
proceed.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,
Let me begin
by saying i'm sorry.
What i'm about to do
is not very kind.
I'm going to take
12 very fine people,
Leading good, happy lives
with lovely families,
And i'm going to
make you live through
The ultimate sin of man--
Murder.
It's my job to make you
feel the horror
Little
liza williams faced.
I'm going to ask you
to close your eyes
And hear the sick sound
of crushing bone
As the defendant
repeatedly bludgeoned
A helpless
22-Year-Old girl.
It's my job
to make you hear
The hollow crackle
of a bashed skull
As the defendant beat
and beat and beat his prey!
You'll almost
be able to see
The spattering of blood
That must have been
all over the defendant
When he finished
this act of terror.
I'm sorry,
but it's my job
To tell you
how a life ended.
It's your job to decide
what to do about it.
Mr. Weathers,
do you care to open?
Yes, your honor.
Evidence.
Mm-Hmm.
That's tagged,
you know.
Hmm.
( People gasp )
Judge:
mr. Weathers--!
That's how
a hammer sounds.
I've never heard it
hit bone before,
But neither has he.
Mr. Weathers.
Mr. Weathers,
that's enough!
So let's skip
the acoustics
And get to
the question.
- Who did it?
- ( Jury gasps )
- Who swung the hammer?
- ( Jury gasps )
Mr. Weathers!
The district attorney says,
"Close your eyes
and hear it."
Well, he has
a great case,
As long as you keep
your eyes closed.
The defendant says,
"keep your eyes open
Because you can't
see the truth
With your eyes closed."
So keep them open.
( Thumping )
( Laughing )
( Cheering begins )
( Gavel pounding )
Judge:
order, order, order!
That is enough!
You people
in the courtroom,
This is not
fenway park!
Mr. Weathers,
You're not pulling that
in this trial.
Another stunt like that,
and you'll regret it.
And you're going to pay
for that table!
Mr. Murray,
your first witness.
The commonwealth calls
mrs. Martha williams
to the stand.
Mrs. Martha williams,
please.
Robin, it's cowens.
I guess he got
the assistant d.A. Job.
That murray's a smart
son of a bitch.
Figures cowens knows you,
knows your style.
Do you swear
to tell the truth,
the whole truth...
anything unusual occur
on the evening of
november 12th?
Martha:
liza was extremely upset.
Do you know why?
Yes.
She'd had a terrible
argument with dr. Benoit.
Do you know why
this particular argument
upset your daughter?
She said dr. Benoit
threatened to kill her.
Object, you fool.
- Murray:did she say why?
- Object!
She'd been
blackmailing him.
He said
if she didn't stop,
- He'd kill her.
- No further questions.
Objection!
Untimely,
mr. Weathers.
I move to strike,
your honor.
No. I'm going to
allow it now.
Mr. Weathers?
I have no questions,
your honor.
The witness
may step down.
They needed predisposition.
Now they've got it.
Your honor,
the commonwealth calls
Dr. Charles peckham
to the stand.
- What's he doing?
- Check the witness list.
I thought
it was our list.
Robin, i'm sorry.
Why's he calling
our witness?
He's going to
discredit our expert.
It's the oldest
trick in the book.
- Object.
- I can't.
They've accepted
the witness list.
Do you swear
to tell the truth,
The whole truth
and nothing but the truth?
But you are familiar
with the degradation
propensity
Of amorphous materials,
are you not?
I'm a pathologist,
that's all.
Your honor,
i'm terribly embarrassed.
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury, i'm sorry.
I assumed dr. Peckham
was qualified for this case.
In light of the fact
That he has no background
in polymer chemistry,
I'm afraid i'd be
less than honest
To hold him out
as an expert.
I'm very sorry.
What's this guy
going to do
to us next?
Very well.
Dr. Peckham,
you're dismissed.
Would you care to bring
one of your other experts?
I counted on
dr. Peckham's testimony
Taking up the afternoon.
However, i do have
mr. Harvey beals,
Who would like
an early appearance.
He's not scheduled
for two weeks.
We haven't even
reviewed him yet.
Do you swear
to tell the truth...
...you said
the girl tried to leave
dr. Benoit's company?
Oh, yes.
She'd had enough of him.
Mr. Beals,
Did dr. Benoit
get upset at this point?
Yes, he did.
He said that he knew
How to keep whores
from lying.
Murray:
i have nothing further.
Good afternoon,
mr. Beals.
It's harvey,
isn't it?
May i call you
harvey?
Thank you.
You just happen to be
the only person
Who heard
that statement?
Probably.
The bar was closing,
And i think i was
the only person
around them.
Had you been
drinking, sir?
- No.
- No?
You just happened to be
in a bar until closing,
And you didn't drink?
Come on, harvey.
Actually, i'd just arrived.
I'm the night cleaner.
( Courtroom laughing )
Um-Hmm. I see.
How old are you,
mr. Beals?
I'm 72.
And how's
your hearing?
Fine.
( Garbled )
haven't had any
problems with it?
I'm sorry,
i didn't get that.
He asked if i had
any problems with it.
( Courtroom laughing )
No more questions,
your honor.
My hearing,
i presume.
( Laughter grows )
News anchor:
...continues throughout much
of the midwest,
With rivers cresting
near record levels
In michigan, indiana, illinois,
missouri, and minnesota.
So far, 11 communities
along the mississippi river
Have suffered
almost complete inundation,
With dams threatening
to give way in numerous others.
On the local scene,
the prosecution
Has rested its case
in the benoit murder trial...
hi.
I'm looking for a guy
named "stormy" weathers.
- Do you know him?
-Never heard of him.
Now, i heard
that he's an ace lawyer
And that he lives
right here.
No, i live here.
Barney rubble.
Nice to meet you.
What's that?
A present.
Actually,
it's sort of
A good luck charm.
You bronzed my cartoon!
This is incredible!
Look at all
that detail.
This is great.
I love it.
Come here.
I think it puts
the whole thing
into perspective.
Well, it does sum up
The way i've been
handling this case.
You know what's wrong,
don't you?
What?
Why do you think
i came here today
Looking for
"stormy" weathers?
Everybody is looking
for "stormy" weathers.
I faked my way
into a murder trial,
Only this time
i don't have a blueprint.
You've got to look
at the torkenson
case objectively.
You won because you used
your imagination.
You just disguised it
as "stormy" weathers.
You came up with
the "ass" defense.
You seized
on wilby's journal
And turned it into
a credibility issue.
You invented the whole
suzie walker defense.
You were thinking
on your feet.
That's what won it
for you.
You were
"stormy" weathers.
That's quite
an analysis.
I don't know
if it's accurate,
But it's astute.
Actually,
i had some counseling.
From who?
Matt cowens.
You went
to see cowens?
No, he came
to see me.
He couldn't
come to see you.
That would be
unethical.
He thought that you
would find that ironic.
But he meant it.
He's concerned
about you.
- Yeah.
- He's also annoyed.
He says that benoit
Entrusted his life
to "stormy" weathers.
He paid
for "stormy" weathers,
And he suggests
That you give him
"stormy" weathers.
Good grief.
He says
it doesn't matter.
They're going to kick
your butt anyway.
- He said that?
- He said it.
They think
they can handle
"stormy" weathers?
Well,
how about you?
What's the news,
good and bad?
I started rehearsals for
the revere wharf theater.
- That's bad.
- That's good.
It's a good part.
- Do they have seats now?
- Yes. Little ones.
The sunshine school
closes in a couple
of days.
- That's bad.
- That's bad.
Get started on it
right away.
This is a lot
of work.
We can't start
a new case now.
It's not a case,
it's a motion.
Get levitt to write it.
He owes me a favor.
I want it filed
in two days. Go.
Mr. Weathers,
your first witness.
The defense calls
dr. Charles peckham.
This is
the same doctor--
Yes, your honor,
the very same doctor
Mr. Murray attempted
to discredit earlier.
Doctor.
Judge:
i remind you, doctor,
you're still under oath.
Peckham:
yes, your honor.
Now, doctor,
Mr. Murray dismissed you
as an expert
Because you didn't specialize
in polymer chemistry.
-Is that right?
- Yes.
Fine.
Could you kindly tell the court
how much yak manure
Is deposited annually
on the plains of rapshu?
What?
I object!
This is going someplace,
counselor?
Yes, your honor.
Will you try and
get there in a hurry?
Doctor?
I'm not an expert
in yak manure.
Could you tell us then
the amount of bat guano
Accumulated monthly
By the flapped-Wing
chilean fruit bat?
I object.
What does bat guano
and yak manure
Have to do with
this case?
I'll tell you what
it has to do with this case.
It has as much to do with it
as polymer chemistry--
Exactly nothing!
It is all a lot of crap!
This case is not about
polymer chemistry.
It is about
murder and blood.
This gentleman has studied
blood and blood samples
For the past 18 years.
He studied the victim's blood
And the bloodstained jacket.
He knows damn well
What those bloodstains reveal!
As for mr. Murray's foray
into polymer chemistry
And the degradation propensity
of amorphous materials,
Your honor, we all know
what that was--
That was a lot
of yak manure.
( Laughter; applause )
( Gavel pounding )
order, order, order!
You concluded,
lieutenant sosha,
That since the murder weapon
And bloodstained clothes
were found in his car,
The murder must have been
committed by dr. Benoit?
That was strong
evidence, yes.
But you didn't find
any fingerprints?
No.
Does it seem strange
that someone would
be so careful
To wipe away every
single fingerprint
And then leave
the murder weapon
is his car
For someone to find?
It's a little
unusual.
Unusual?
Isn't it possible
that someone else
Put those items under
the defendant's car seat?
It's possible,
but why didn't he
call the police?
He knew the stuff
was in the car.
It was right
under him.
Isn't it possible
he didn't know?
He was sitting
right over it.
So it would be ridiculous
for him to have not known?
Absolutely.
Then it would be ridiculous
for someone not to know
He was sitting
over a caged rabbit?
Someone like you,
lieutenant sosha?
( Laughter )
It's a rabbit?
- This is outrageous.
-Is it?
There's no telling
what we'll find
In mr. Murray's
trial bag.
( Laughter grows )
Oh, my god.
That boy!
( Buzzing )
We will assume
mr. Murray
Didnotknow
this was in there.
Or did you?
( Laughing continues )
Your honor, please!
Don't look at me.
It ain't mine!
( Burst of laughter )
( Buzzing stops )
( Buzzing )
( Buzzing stops )
It's a long story.
Candy meade--
I found her.
May we have
a minute, please?
- Take two, mr. Weathers.
- Thank you.
Lieutenant,
you're dismissed.
It's great.
He never laid
a hand on her.
It was the other
way around.
She says she bullied him.
He was afraid of her.
Look at this!
That's incredible!
There's more.
He never made love to her.
He couldn't get it up.
He was mr. Limp.
- Benoit?
- Pure pasta.
She says he took her
to all the big functions
And told everybody
what a stud he was.
Get this--
She says she has a pimp
And her pimp
beat the hell
out of benoit.
Sound familiar?
This is great.
Will she testify?
- She says she will.
- Yes!
( Benoit laughing )
This is too funny.
The prosecution
is depicting you
as a monster
Who pistol-Whips
with a hard-On.
Candy meade
can defuse that.
She can make you
look harmless.
Yes, but this picture
is doctored.
It isn't even me.
Doug, that's crazy.
Now, listen--
No, you listen to me.
You can't possibly ask
this poor little psychotic girl
To recite these lies.
She can help
our case.
She can't help it.
She's lying.
I broke off the liaison.
It's a very sad attempt
to humiliate me.
Doug,
Impotence
is a common problem.
( Ripping photo )
Robin,
we've got to go.
Guy should be
weaving baskets
somewhere.
Robin, come on.
During the course
of your 12-Year
friendship,
Did you have
an opportunity
to observe
The behavioral patterns
of dr. Benoit?
I did.
Are those behavioral
patterns consistent
With the type
of behavior
He is being
charged with today?
They are not.
Doug may be mercurial,
But he doesn't have
a violent bone
in his body.
Anybody who's met him
knows that.
Thank you, sir.
Your witness.
No questions.
The witness
may step down.
Mr. Weathers?
We are going to bring this trial
to a rapid conclusion.
The defense would like
to call our next witness,
The victim,
liza williams.
- Objection! I object!
- Do you, mr. Murray?
Then you can object
to the girl's face,
Because she is
on her way up.
Counselor--
The reason a body
was never found
Is because liza williams
never died.
She is one her way
up these stairs,
And in 15 seconds,
liza williams
Is going to walk
through those doors.
( Footsteps approaching )
Sorry.
- Traffic.
- ( Courtroom chuckles )
I guess i was wrong.
Liza williams is not
coming through that door.
But every one of you looked.
You all watched that door.
If you looked,
You must have thought
for a split second
That she just might.
And if you thought
for the slightest fraction
That she could
come through that door,
Then you have
a reasonable doubt.
If you have
a reasonable doubt,
You must find
the defendant not guilty!
Now, you remember--
When you go back
into that room
To decide
my client's fate,
Remember
to ask yourself
One hard,
honest question--
Did you look?
( Applause )
He does have
a certain flair.
Order.
This court is adjourned
until tomorrow morning.
Robin!
Robin!
I think he did it.
He never looked
at the door.
That's not
good enough, doug.
It's good enough
for me.
Every person
in that courtroom looked.
Every single person
couldn't help but look.
- It was compelling.
- I've told you before,
Your thought
processes
Are so transparent,
they're laughable.
Not that it wasn't
a good trick.
It was
quite clever.
It's just the kind
of cheap theatrics
That might
win it for us.
Indeed i may not even
have to testify.
Robin:rubbish.
You can get yourself
another lawyer, pal.
Robin,
take it easy!
On what basis will you
justify withdrawal?
Lack of disclosure.
You said you were innocent.
If i had known
you were guilty
I have chosen
a different course,
or refused the case.
But i am innocent.
I have never
concealed anything,
have i, gentlemen?
Well, speak up.
I have maintained
my innocence
from day one,
And i still
maintain it.
No one here
has heard me say
Anything
to the contrary.
Robin, he's right.
Go ahead. Withdraw.
I will get a mistrial,
And you will get
a disbarment.
I guarantee it.
You really are bloated
with self-Importance,
aren't you?
Don't provoke me.
Other people
have provoked me--
Like liza williams
and luther moses?
( Laughs )
i was about to say,
"And lived
to regret it."
Do you seriously think
That you can prod me
into a confession?
Oh, you really
are amusing.
I'm sick of you,
benoit.
I'm sick of seeing you
prance around
Like some
ridiculous peacock.
Have you...
any idea...
what it takes
to kill a human being?
I don't mean one brute
bashing another brute's skull
Out of primitive passion.
I mean the kind of measured,
dispassionate action
That comes from absolute
clarity of mind,
Transcends
rational thought.
The kind of action
that springs
From absolute
necessity,
Unclouded by the restraints
of conscience,
Mercy, pity.
The kind of action
that allows one
To take a common,
ordinary hammer
And with clinical precision,
split a skull so cleanly
That the cranium cracks
right through the medulla,
Allowing the claw
of the hammer
To be used to pry back
the skull cleanly,
Exposing the brain,
While the subject
remains alive,
Even aware.
Such a man
is to be envied,
Revered,
And much feared,
Never paralyzed by...
impotence of will.
Luther moses may well have
encountered such a man
And liza williams,
And liza williams' mother
must fear such a man.
Even you may encounter
such a man someday.
Do not involve yourself
in betrayal, mr. Weathers.
( Laughing )
but if you imagine
that i am such a man...
then your judgment
is clouded indeed.
I merely tell you this
so you know
The sort of man
you're looking for.
I am a professor
of english literature,
In short,
a somewhat disagreeable
But benign
english teacher,
A perceptive
but innocent man,
So, do let's get on
with it, gentlemen.
Good day to you all.
Oh, my god.
That was
quite a show.
Show?
What are you
talking about?
He ripped
her skull open.
God knows what
he did to moses
And what he's gonna do
to liza's mother.
He didn't say that.
I think he wants
a mistrial.
The acquittal ratio
goes up dramatically
in second trials.
You know that.
He knows that.
You have absolutely
no basis whatsoever
for withdrawal.
He admitted nothing.
He threatened
mrs. Williams' life!
We're representatives
of the court,
We're obligated
to reveal that.
It was a hypothetical
statement,
A veiled threat at best.
Maybe he wants
to be guilty.
This implied violence
is contradictory
To his established
behavior.
That's the weak link
for the prosecution.
The guy hasn't shown
the slightest tendency
to violence.
The truth is,
we don't know
what the truth is,
Which is exactly
what he wants.
What are we
going to do?
I'm going home.
This isn't fun
anymore.
I'm sorry, robin,
But theories don't mean
that much to me.
I just keep seeing
that poor woman.
You shouldn't have
told me all that.
You're right.
I shouldn't have.
Yeah,
you should have.
Why can't you make him
plead insanity?
That's what he is.
Anyone who can think
of such a thing--
I can't make him
do anything.
I can either
defend him
Or withdraw
and probably
be disbarred.
Then be disbarred.
I'd rather see you
be disbarred than have
Anything to do with
letting this man go.
Is that really what
you want me to do?
No.
What good
will that do?
There'll only
be a mistrial,
And he'll probably
get off anyway.
They may
find him guilty.
It's still
very close,
And he may
be innocent.
You believe that?
No.
Man:
jo ann!
Jodie's getting really hot.
Come on!
I'm coming!
Two minutes, okay?
I've got to go.
I'll see you later?
I don't think so.
I think i just
got to let you do
What you
have to do.
I can't help,
and i can't deal
with that.
It sounds serious.
It's not.
I mean, it's not
serious for us.
I'll see you
when it's over?
Meaning you're
not coming tomorrow?
I don't think so.
Just promise me
one thing--
That you'll
try your best
To let the truth
come out.
That's what it's
supposed to be
about, isn't it?
In fairy tales.
So make this one
come true.
You can do it.
You're "stormy" weathers.
I'll see you.
Bailiff:
here you go,
mr. Weathers.
Don't do anything
i wouldn't do.
Thank you, sir.
Ha ha ha!
Ee-Ee-Hhhh!
Ee-Ee-Eehhhhhhh!
The vibrator.
Yeah, that's right.
I'll tell you,
you are good.
I've been here
nearly 20 years.
You're the slipperiest
one i ever seen.
I mean, rabbits,
missing bodies,
yak shit.
You're going to
get this guy off.
You've got
this jury snowed.
I'm out of here.
I'll see you.
Oh, god.
Mr. Weathers?
You look like hell.
I'm going to
go wash up.
You turned gruel
into chocolate mousse.
You should be exultant.
What's happened?
I think i'm about to get
a psychotic acquitted.
Go clean up,
and come to my office.
Yes, ma'am.
You're as naive as the day
you walked in here.
They're almost
always guilty.
But almost
always convicted.
Benoit may walk.
So, you've done
a good job.
You've upheld
your oath.
I know.
Code of legal ethics
say that i must do
Everything i can
within the boundaries
of the law
To get an acquittal.
And the dilemma is?
My sense
of right and wrong
say that i shouldn't.
How can the ethical thing
not be moral?
Because that's
the way it is,
And even
"stormy" weathers
Can't do anything
about that.
Would this be
that easy for you?
No.
This is about as brutal
as it ever gets.
Actually...
i had a similar situation
early on in my career.
It wasn't
life-Involving,
but important.
I followed
the code.
The results
were somewhat tragic.
I've never forgotten it.
The wounds pile up.
After a while,
you are afraid
You're nothing
but scar tissue.
Well, enough homilies
from aunt roberta.
I understand
he did not admit
his guilt.
No.
And he did not
tell you directly
He was going to
harm mrs. Williams.
No.
Well, then as far
as i can see,
Your choices
are quite simple.
You do your best
to get him off,
Or you get him
to confess.
What?
That's within
your mandate.
Get him to admit
his guilt.
"Let the truth come out--"
That's what
it's all about, right?
Right.
I still
believe that.
Dr. Benoit?
We're not going to
take chisels
To one another
again, are we?
It's getting
wearisome.
No, we're not.
We have to decide
Whether you're
going to testify.
I will decide
whether or not
i testify.
Do we have it won?
You know better
than that.
You never know what
a jury's gonna do.
It could go
either way.
You're going to
get me if you can,
aren't you?
Well, maybe
i shouldn't testify.
I don't think
you should.
You won't be
a good witness.
I'll be as good
as i need to be.
Is that
your decision?
Yes.
Yes,
i think so.
All right,
But i must warn you
murray is brilliant,
Truly.
The emphasis,
For my benefit,
on "truly."
You're pushing
the right buttons now.
Congratulations,
But i am brilliant, too.
Or hadn't i told you?
Bailiff:
do you swear
to tell the truth,
The whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?
I do.
Be seated.
Would you please
state your name
for the record?
My name
is douglas benoit.
And your occupation?
I'm an professor
of english literature
at boston university.
How long have you
been so employed?
14 years.
Are you married,
dr. Benoit?
Yes, i have been
married for 19 years.
That is my wife
sitting over there.
I thank god
that through all this,
She still loves me.
Your marriage
is important
to you, then?
It is the most
important thing
in my life.
Sir, did you
have an affair
With liza williams?
Yes, i am ashamed
to admit that i did.
I'm a vain man,
mr. Weathers.
I have trouble in resisting
the attention of women,
But despite
the contradiction,
I love my wife,
i always have.
Dr. Benoit,
where were you
On the night
of november 12th?
I was at my home.
With your wife?
No. She was away
visiting her sister.
You are aware, sir,
are you not,
That this
was the night
Of liza williams'
disappearance?
Yes, i am.
And do you have
any information
Pertaining to
the disappearance
of liza williams?
I swear i don't.
I saw her the evening
she disappeared,
But i have never
seen her again
since then.
You are also aware
that the murder weapon
Was found in your car?
I have no idea
how it got there.
Someone had to
have put it there,
Someone who wanted
the girl's death linked to me.
Obviously he...
or she
did an excellent job.
Sir,
Did you kill
liza williams?
No, i did not.
I know that i was
at home alone.
I have no alibis
or anything,
But if you didn't
do anything,
Then you don't need
an alibi.
I am innocent.
All i have
is my word,
But i am innocent.
Thank you, dr. Benoit.
Your witness.
Your honor,
one moment, please.
Bring that brief
to jo ann.
Judge:
mr. Murray?
Murray:
dr. Benoit,
I take it by your testimony,
You're a man with
a rather heavy libido.
Objection.
He testified
as to sexual encounters
With liza williams.
His sex drive,
or lack of it
Have nothing to do
with this case.
I want to know why he
spent time with the victim.
Judge:
i'll allow it.
Doctor?
I do not deny having
had sexual relations
with the girl,
Nor do i deny
other indiscretions
Which bear
upon my sense
of fidelity,
But i did not
murder anybody.
I could not
even imagine...
that kind
of violence.
I see. And during
your marriage, sir,
How many other women
have you slept with?
-Objection!
- Sustained.
"He unwilling
to defend his honor
Is not a man."
Henry david thoreau
said that.
"Yabba dabba doo."
Frederick flintstone
said that. So what?
( Courtroom laughs )
Ask questions,
mr. Murray.
A man should
defend his honor,
Shouldn't he,
dr. Benoit?
Yes, i think
he should.
If you were wronged,
Would you passively
accept it?
I would like
to think not.
And, in fact,
when luther moses
wronged you,
You didn't lie down
for that, did you?
Objection.
You physically
attacked him.
Objection.
Prior acts
are inadmissible.
- Sustained.
- Sorry.
He's badgering.
That's what benoit wants.
He's blowing it.
Liza williams
wronged you, didn't she?
- I suppose.
- You suppose?
She blackmailed you,
exploited you, taunted you.
What's he doing?
He's making benoit
look sympathetic, damn it.
Can you identify this?
It's the hammer
that was found
in my car.
Ever see it before
this trial?
No.
Ever hold it comfortably
in your hand the way
you are now?
Objection!
This is outrageous.
He's put the hammer
in his hands
To facilitate the picture
for the jury
When he asks them later
to close their eyes
and imagine it!
They'll better able to
because they've already seen it!
You've made
your objection!
My objection
is just beginning!
- Sidebar.
- No, on the record.
He has committed
gross misconduct
To get me to move
for a mistrial
Because he knows
he can't win.
He has introduced evidence
he knows to be false.
He knows my client
is not violent.
The state psychiatrist
called the defendant "timid,"
"Submissive"!
He knows my client
did not attack luther moses.
Two eyewitness saw him cower
from the confrontation!
I did not cower.
He says how comfortable
the hammer looks in his hand.
But does he tell them
the trace of vomit on it?
Does he mention
that when police
First showed him
the bloodstained hammer
He became so queasy
he threw up?
- He's testifying!
- You testified, too,
And you lied!
All these
false implications!
This is a last
minute grope
To depict my client
as a violent womanizer
When he knows
the opposite is true.
- Don't presume what i know!
-It's in your files!
Attack luther moses?
He begged him for mercy.
He crawled away
like a frightened puppy.
-Mr. Weathers--
-Heavy libido? Hah!
You have a signed
statement saying
He was sexually
inadequate.
You want to hear
about his sex drive?
Let's ask his wife!
They tried to save the marriage
by having a child
But he couldn't
come through!
This is a man
who is a sex-Driven killer?
Mr. Weathers!
Look at the adjectives
used to describe him
in your own file!
A scared man,
a weak man,
Mr. Weathers,
you are in contempt--
- Afraid...
-Mr. Weathers--
- Impotent!
- Shut up.
- Impotent!
- Shut up!
-Impotent!
-( Woman screams )
Doctor?
Dr. Benoit?
Dr. Benoit,
you may step down now.
What's he done?
He's gotten him
to confess.
And gotten himself
a disbarment.
Judge:
we can continue
at a later date.
Possibly.
Dr. Benoit?
Play ball.
Obviously
we cannot proceed.
Mr. Murray
and mr. Weathers,
In my chambers,
please.
Your honor?
The prosecution has
no further questions.
There are times
when one wishes
One had the wisdom
of solomon.
Mr. Weathers?
Your honor,
In light of what
we have seen
In this courtroom
today,
I move that these proceedings
be declared a mistrial
And attorneys
for dr. Benoit
Be allowed to prepare
an appropriate defense.
Lacking the wisdom
of solomon,
I must rely
upon my own judgment.
The question
of guilt or innocence
Has not been impeached
by dr. Benoit's outburst.
The question of
his state of mind
Can be addressed
by an appeal.
This trial
will continue.
- Exception.
- Noted.
Do you wish a recess
at this time?
Mr. Weathers?
The defense rests.
( Courtroom murmuring )
I note for the record
That dr. Benoit
has waived his rights
To be present at the reading
of the verdict.
Madam foreman,
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,
Hearken now
to your verdict.
We, the jury,
find the defendant,
douglas benoit,
Guilty of murder
in the first degree.
-So say you all?
- Jury:aye.
Judge:
so be it.
Sentencing will take place
two weeks from today.
Mr. Weathers,
i shudder to think
Of the implications
of what has happened
in this courtroom.
Though i must confess,
I am not entirely without
sympathy for your actions.
Nonetheless,
for your contempt,
I order you to serve 10 days
in the county detention,
Commencement of sentence
to be delayed pending appeal.
This jury is dismissed.
This court is adjourned.
( Gavel bangs )
All rise.
( Murmuring )
What would
you have done?
I would have
gotten him off.
You would have let him
walk the streets?
I'm a lawyer.
You did
the right thing.
Anything else
would have been
wrong.
I hope so.
I wouldn't want you
as my lawyer.
Ha ha ha ha!
Hmm.
Why are you
crying?
I don't have
the slightest idea.
We're suing
the president of
the united states.
It's a class action
on behalf of brigitte
And all the kids
at the sunshine school.
They got rights.
But the president?
And the u.S. Congress.
I don't mess around.
I'm going to cry.
- You are crying.
- No, i'm not.
You said you needed
a good lawyer.
Well, you got
an ex-Hotshot
criminal attorney
Fresh out
of the limelight.
Robin--
Yeah, i know.
I'm a hell
of a guy.
