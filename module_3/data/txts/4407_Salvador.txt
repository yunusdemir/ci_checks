<i> In the wake of the
Nicaraguan revolution...</i>
<i> ...chaos has descended on tiny
El Salvador, in Central America.</i>
<i> Today, 18 people were
killed and 36 wounded...</i>
<i> ...in a gun battle between
demonstrators and the national police.</i>
<i> It started when students, workers and
peasants linked to the guerillas...</i>
<i> ...occupied foreign embassies
and took over the National Cathedral.</i>
<i> So far, in two months, more than
3000 people have disappeared.</i>
<i> The government blames the murders
on left-wing Marxist terrorists...</i>
<i> ...while left-wing spokesmen
point to the right-wing death squads.</i>
You cannot walk in like this!
Good morning.
You got some money for me?
- No, I have no money.
- I want you out of here, okay?
- We cannot go out!
- I want you out!
Look, I put up with
this shit every month.
I want you, your crumb-snatcher...
...and your war hero, or
whatever the fuck he is...
I want him out of here!
Fuck your husband! You got no bucks...
No bucks, no Buck Rogers, Boyle!
Wait until I've had my coffee, huh?
- You're disturbing my kid.
- Better get your bitch!
Shit on your papers!
Good morning.
I've had it!
I cannot live like this no more!
Nancy, it's Richard.
Listen...
- Richard who?
- Boyle.
- Oh.
- Richard Boyle, yeah.
I think El Salvador's
gonna blow real soon.
With a new press card and two grand
I can get some good stuff.
- No way.
- Okay.
- How about a new press card?
- Forget it.
- Come on, Nancy, please!
- I gotta go.
We've had it with you. We gave
you $2500 on that Lebanon gig.
- You fucked it away in Greece.
- I can't take Muslim nightlife, okay?
You lose tickets, passports,
you drink...
...and you're an embarrassment,
Boyle.
I get the piece, don't I?
How about the IRA, "Tortured
by the Brits in Belfast"?
And how about Cambodia,
"The Last Man Out"?
Sidney Schamburg was having
cocktails at the Plaza...
...and I was getting my ass kicked.
How about freezing my nuts off
in the Khyber Pass? I got giardia.
- I was stapled to the toilet for weeks.
- Remember El Salvador?
How about El Salvador?
Didn't I call that one?
- Huh, Nancy? Come on.
- Bye.
- Hey, come on.
- Get the fuck out of here, will you?
Not you, Nancy. Nancy?
I'm sorry. Nancy?
Nice work, you piece of...
Larry, I need another favor.
I gotta be at the airport
in an hour for Beirut.
This is serious. For old times' sake.
You gotta give me $500 to go
to El Salvador, $400...
They'll kill you
if you go back there.
I need money, not a lecture.
Okay, $300. I'll meet you
at Pan Am in 40 minutes.
Great.
Take the quarter.
Such a fucking hurry.
Shit.
Mr. Boyle, your license
has been revoked.
You're driving without a license,
registration or insurance.
You've got four outstanding speeding
tickets, all gone to warrant.
You've got 43 unpaid parking tickets.
- Jesus.
- Nothing is legal about your car.
- Even your press card is out-of-date.
- Out-of-date?
- Damn.
- I'm taking you in.
No... Oh, I'm not that Richard Boyle.
This happens all the time.
- There's another Richard...
- Give me your other hand.
Have some humanity, officer.
I just...
You, come here. You, come on.
Back up.
- Thanks for getting me out.
- Come on and get your car.
Look, they got Bagel.
The Nazis busted Bagel.
They're gonna gas him. Get your car.
I don't have my car, Doc,
I need $75 to get it out.
Shit, I just paid $125
to get you out!
Stop whining.
- Here, this is all I got.
- Thank you.
Come on before they
drop the pellet.
It's just a fucking dog.
It's my dog!
Faster, Richie, will you?
I don't even have a license.
They'll throw away the key.
- How long has he been there?
- I don't know.
I left him with shit friends.
They're not gonna gas
the poor dog, okay?
Everything's turned to shit,
Miriam's thrown me out, man.
She says I'm too old
to be a disc jockey.
She wants me to sell computers in
Silicon Valley, you believe that?
I can't take these yuppie women.
With the Walkmans and
the running shoes...
...and the "rather go to aerobics
than fuck," forget about it.
They got pussy exercises too.
Latin women, they're
totally different.
They're kind and understanding.
Look at Claudia. She doesn't
give a shit what I do...
- Yeah.
- Primo.
Best thing about them is
they don't speak English.
Richie, can I crash at
your place tonight?
I got no place to go. I'll sleep in
the shower, toilet, doesn't matter.
Light up another joint, Doc.
I got some bad news.
- I don't got a place.
- Huh?
We're evicted. We were gonna
stay with you and... Bosco.
- Bagel?
- Bagel.
You mean I gave you my last $200
and I got no place to stay?
- Hey, Doc...
- That's great.
Now what am I supposed to do?
I'm in deep shit.
Man, I should've just
left you in jail.
Move over, move over!
Another yuppie
in a fucking Oldsmobile.
This town is full of goddamn yuppies.
Yuppie town!
Bagel!
Bagel?
Where's my dog?
What does he look like?
- Oh, yeah, I know this dog.
- Where is he?
- Bagel!
- Excuse me.
Sir? Excuse me.
No, that's not your dog.
We had to put your dog to sleep.
We keep the dogs around 14 days.
We kept him more.
- You put him to sleep?
- Yeah.
When's he going to wake up?
You killed him, didn't you?
You gassed him.
We gave him an injection.
It's much more humane...
What kind of humanity is that?
You're a murderer, you know that?
I can't believe it.
That was my only relationship,
my best friend. Seven years.
My marriage only lasted five.
- It's not just!
- I'm really sorry.
Would you like some puppies?
- My dog's leash.
- I'm sorry.
Doc, she can't do anything.
Now come on, okay?
All right?
What's it say?
"Fuck you" in Italian.
Shit, she's gone back to Italy
to her parents, goddamn it.
That's too bad, Richie.
Well, at least she left the TV.
It was a marriage made in hell.
I'm sure gonna miss my boy.
Maybe she'll be back.
Sure.
Who could leave all this?
- Where we going now?
- Guatemala.
Why?
Why not?
No cops, no laws, sun, it's cheap.
No yuppies. Great dope.
Look at you, will you? You are like
a walking museum of the '60s.
What the fuck are you?
I'm a forward-thinking human being.
I know about life.
I explore things.
Being a journalist,
you're in touch with reality.
You come off with this journalism
bullshit all the time, you know that?
I haven't seen one goddamn article
that you've written.
I wrote a book.
Flower of the Dragon.
Flower of the Dragon
was ten years ago!
It was a big exposé.
Ten years ago.
What have you written since?
What are you talking about?
I've written articles.
I have one in a newspaper
in El Salvador about guerillas.
Oh, the one in El Salvador?
I read that, my whole family read it.
Everyone saw that article, Boyle.
You said Guatemala, man,
not El Salvador.
Come on, I've never been
out of the country.
They kill people here, Boyle.
You believe everything in the papers?
You'll love it here.
Give me the joint.
This is my last chance, man.
I'm serious.
If I can get some good combat
shots for AP, I can make some money.
- I could pay you back.
- Better pay me back.
We'll head for La Libertad...
...the best surfing beach
in the world.
Good times, kick back for a few
months. It'll be fantastic.
You could live in this country
for 300 bucks a year.
- What the fuck is this?
- Mace.
- Mace? For what?
- Wild dogs.
Yeah, wild dogs? That's bullshit.
You've lied to me straight through.
Want me to be honest with you?
What are you doing with all these?
- Here you could have a life.
- What are all these?
They come in handy.
You're gonna love it here, Doc.
- I'm going home, man.
- You can drive drunk...
- ...and get anybody killed for $50.
- I don't want to.
The best pussy in the world.
Where else can you get a virgin
to sit on your face for seven bucks?
Seven bucks.
It better be the best pussy
in the world...
- ...or I'm going home.
- Two virgins for 12.
You're just lucky I'm fucked up,
you know that?
Drugs? No prescriptions. They got
stuff that keeps you hard all night.
All these people want to do is fuck.
Twelve bucks?
I think we can get them down.
- Now you're talking.
- You're such an asshole, Boyle.
You're gonna love this place.
You're gonna be in pig heaven, man.
- Why are they blocking the road?
- Don't ask.
This ain't gringo-land.
Here, take this, be dumb,
act cool, all right?
Is this some kind of tranquillizer?
Yeah, permanent one. Cyanide.
You're gonna be sorry
when they cut off your balls...
...and stuff one in each ear.
You're so fucking dramatic, man.
Jesus!
Who are these clowns?
- What the fuck?
- Traffic accident.
Jesus, Boyle.
- Oh God, man!
- Relax, man, it's just some guy.
Shit.
The road to Santa Ana is closed.
I understand, but Colonel Figueroa
told me to give a present to you boys.
They're journalists.
Get out of the car.
Whatever you do, Doc,
whatever you do...
...don't get on the ground.
Jesus Christ, man, this is scary.
I can't believe this, man.
I'm a friend of Colonel Figueroa...
- Friends of Figueroa.
- I'm a friend of Figueroa's.
Is that bad?
He's a friend of Figueroa's.
Shut up!
What's going on here, man?
I think they're checking cédulas.
What's a cédula?
Birth certificates, voting papers.
If you don't have a cédula,
you're in deep shit.
Put your hands on your head.
We've stopped a truck load
of suspicious campesinos.
He's probably a student,
the worst thing you can be.
Why did you leave your papers at home?
I always leave them there.
Please, sir.
Look, I'm a friend
of Colonel Figueroa's.
Fucking ridiculous. I should've never
bailed you out of jail, man.
- Who are your friends?
- Communists!
Take off your glasses.
Oh, shit.
Holy shit! They're gonna fucking
kill us now, Boyle.
I thought you knew your way around.
They're gonna kill us now,
aren't they?!
They're gonna fucking kill us!
Shut the fuck up! Just be cool!
I don't know what they're gonna do.
This is it.
This is it.
You got any of those
tranquillizers left?
COLONEL JULIO FIGUEROA
Commander 3rd Brigade, Infantry
Santa Ana Garrison
How the hell did you get in here?
No periodistas are allowed.
I snuck in through Guatemala, colonel.
You're lucky you've got your huevos,
you know that?
You look like shit.
Come with me.
You wash up.
You got some drinks, some food.
We got some nice tight pussy.
For my amigo here...
...he write me up
in the American newspaper...
...like the Patton of El Salvador.
You were. It was the last
great cavalry charge in history:
Your Soccer War with Honduras, '69.
All the way to Tegucigalpa.
Not since Attila the Hun have there
been such amazing cavalry tactics.
This one takes it up the culo
real nice.
How about this one?
She take it up the culo too?
All right.
Libertad, Doc.
End of the rainbow.
I'm sick.
My asshole hurts, my dick burns...
You know, Richie,
I don't know how to say this...
...but it's been fun
traveling with you.
I'd like to catch a plane out.
Do you think you're gonna die?
I got the best doctor in town.
You have nothing to worry about
once you get the shot.
It's a joke, it's a joke.
- What the hell's she laughing at?
- Nothing.
Everything in there
will clean you out.
If it doesn't, it'll kill you.
- What about a subscription?
- All you need is an ass.
Don't pay her. I got credit here.
I gotta run.
That's a big fucking needle!
Now, come on, please.
Just give me...
Son of a bitch!
Ricardo! Ricardo!
Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?
What a pretty girl.
They said you were dead.
Where's her father?
Disappeared.
Let's go to the house.
You still drunk? You still crazy?
No, for you I stopped.
No more alcohol.
At the casa,
we'll see the television.
I know you have another woman
in the north.
Another woman?
Is that you, Major Max?
You back from the dead, man?
I like your friend, Dr. Rock.
How bad is it here?
If I had one of those,
I'd be a little better off.
You gotta be good-looking and rich.
- If you have a woman you have it made.
- My ass hurts.
- Ricardo, can I have some?
- Yeah, go ahead, go ahead.
Yeah, yeah, Guatemala gold.
Driving down this road,
isn't it beautiful?
You want to go back home?
Everywhere I turn...
...dogs screwing other dogs...
...pigs in the street, it's like
Baltimore, for chrissake.
How are we for cash?
You hungry? Want a hamburger?
Maybe just one before you take me
to the airport.
I mean, I got a life there,
even without Miriam.
I bailed you out of jail, you owe me
a lot of money over the years...
...I wish you'd pay me so we can,
like, part company, you know?
- John.
- Rick!
I thought I'd find you here.
- I thought you were dead.
- Do I look that bad?
Yes. I heard stories from Guatemala.
They pulled your toenails out...
Fucking Guatemala. Jesus.
- How was Beirut?
- Fucking awful.
You gonna eat those fries?
Dr. Rock, John Cassady.
Thanks.
That was a great cover
for Newsweek, John.
What happened?
How come you split so fast?
What, from here? I had a beef
with Major Max's boys.
They weren't happy about the
torture chamber story.
Waiter!
Major Max?
Who's Major Max?
This guy's after you too,
on top of everything else?
That was a year ago.
They don't have computers.
- Get out of here.
- I'm getting out.
First plane, I'm gone.
I'm not kidding this time.
Get the fuck out of here!
I want my money, Boyle.
- What money?
- I want the money you owe me.
- No bullshit!
- You're on drugs. There is no money!
The transmission in Guatemala,
gas, whores, the border ripoff.
You know at the border
we had 70 colones?
You know how many we got left? 12.
How much is 12 colones?
- Four bucks. Three bucks.
- Three American dollars?!
That's all we got left?
My dog is dead, Boyle.
Stop doing that!
You know why he's doing that?
This is why. He drinks Tic Tack.
It's 17 cents a bottle.
You can't get rid of the guy.
He'll follow you anywhere.
Want to go to Beirut?
Tell me what it has to do with me.
It's your yuppie liberal bullshit...
It has nothing the fuck
to do with me, man!
I'm stuck in the middle
of his fucking country, man.
I got the shits and I only got
three fucking dollars!
I gotta get out of here, man!
Fuck you, Boyle. Fuck you.
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
He was this hitchhiker
I picked up in Guatemala.
Look, John, I'm really sorry...
It's on Newsweek.
You want me to be honest with you?
I got fired by PNS, okay?
And I could use a string real bad.
- Could you help?
- There's no work here.
- Nobody cares about this war.
- I care.
They're not just shooting the Indians.
Last week a Mexican TV guy
got blown away...
...by their paramilitary groups.
They're shooting at us.
- Why don't you try Angola?
- It's got no nightlife.
Hey, I can get you in with Figueroa.
I got carte blanche
with his elite unit.
You still got the death-mobile.
Come on, Boyle.
Want to go out on dawn patrol?
Or are you too big
of a media star these days?
- Let's go.
- All right.
EL PLAYON
Dump site for death squad victims
You haven't looked through
a lens in a while.
Take some pictures.
There's fresh bodies up there.
Have you got...
...a 24 or a 28 I could use?
You know what made photographers
like Robert Capa great, Rich?
They weren't after money.
They captured the nobility
of human suffering.
That was a great shot in Spain.
One flying through the air.
Yeah, but it was more
than a body, Richie.
He got...
...why they died.
That's what Capa caught.
He caught that moment of death.
You're right up there with him.
You're the best.
You gotta get close, Rich...
...to get the truth.
You get too close, you die.
Someday...
...I want a shot like Capa.
Someday.
Someday.
I gotta go, man.
We gotta go.
I don't have to tell you
to watch yourself, do I?
Alvarez's people are staked out
at the Cathedral, nowadays.
I'll talk to him for you.
And Tom Kelly's the new ambassador.
- From Cambodia?
- You should check him out.
I know him. He's a good man.
There's gonna be a party at the
embassy on Tuesday for the election.
John, thanks.
Cambodia was something, huh?
RAMON ALVAREZ
Director of Human Rights Office...
...and spokesman for the
Revolutionary Democratic Front
MAIN CATHEDRAL
San Salvador
What's going on here?
This is where people find out
about the disappeared.
- What did he say?
- These people are from a land co-op.
They were evicted by police,
so they're on strike.
I saw that in Zapata.
Carmen!
Carmen Sanchez. Hey, it's Ricardo.
Hi, how are you?
Ramon?
Did John Cassady talk to you
about my going out with the guerillas?
Ramon, I need a break and I did a
good story on you last year, remember?
Look, I'm not a travel agency
for you guys.
I know, but if Max takes power, you'll
need good press. I'd like to help.
Good press.
There are 10,000 disappeared...
...and every day the list grows,
and you pendejo...
...talk about good press.
Ramon...
...I got some shots this morning
and maybe they can help you...
...from El Playon. I'm sorry, okay?
To the mountains?
Come back next week. I arrange it.
Oh, God. Thank you, Carmen.
Sister Stan?
- Hi, how you doing?
- Oh, fine.
- It's good to see you back.
- Good to see you.
Cathy's around somewhere.
You look awfully busy.
Yes. Parents missing, dead, lost.
These are some survivors from
the massacre at the Sempa River.
I heard government helicopters
fired as they crossed.
It's very bad now. Very bad.
It's very bad now. Very bad.
It's very bad now. Very bad.
It's very bad now. Very bad.
Madness on both sides.
Cathy Moore.
The prettiest Colleen
in all of El Salvador.
What are you doing here,
you degenerate?
Back to see old girlfriends
at the Noa Noa?
- You ruined that by converting them.
- I try.
Need a ride to La Libertad tomorrow?
I can't, I got too much to do
around here.
Fudge!
It's the wrong piece!
It's for an elbow!
I told Cleveland!
It happens every time! They promised.
Come on, Cathy. We'll have
another shipment next month.
Anisetta can wait.
Can't you, darling?
One... two...
...three... four...
...five.
Now you can go to any urban city
and you can make it.
Try to halt the infiltration
into the Americas...
...by terrorists,
by outside interference...
...and those who aren't
just aiming at El Salvador...
...but I think are aiming at...
...the whole of Central and
possibly later, South America...
...and, I'm sure,
eventually North America.
Can you believe that...
...the straight man to a chimpanzee
will be the next president of the U.S.?
I mean, doesn't that depress you?
- Know what depresses me?
- What?
- You!
- I can accept that.
I can't! This is like a gig.
I'm trying to make money.
How can I, with you
yakking and hobbling around?
Go get something to eat or go to
the pool and meet girls, will you?
- Stay out of my face!
- Okay, I'm easy.
Yakking all the time.
...going for Ronald Reagan.
- Morgan.
- I thought you were dead.
What brings you here?
Reagan planning ahead?
Colonel Hyde, remember me?
COLONEL BENTLEY HYDE
Senior Officer MILGROUP
U.S. Advisor Salvador Military
- Pacific News Service, Vietnam?
- Bob Samuels, USAID.
How do you do?
Millicent Davies, US AFL-CIO.
Remember me, sir?
Yeah, I remember.
Last time I heard about you
was when Thieu kicked you out.
Then Mr. Thieu
got kicked out after me.
I never understood why you guys
like the Commies so much.
"We guys."
If you were Vietnamese, you'd be in a
reeducation camp pulling turnips.
I never really liked turnips very much.
And I'm not applying
for Vietnamese citizenship.
They don't like that funny stuff
you smoke, old buddy.
Why, you got some?
Colonel, let me ask you something.
It's a big favor.
You think you could get me out
on a Cazadore op?
If I get you out...
...what's in it for me?
These guys never change.
Vietnam. You know, Vietnam.
I mean, are we gonna
invade here or what?
I don't know
what you're talking about.
I was young during all that.
Look, I'm not supposed
to talk to the press, okay?
And you're weird. So fuck off.
I'm not the press.
JACK MORGAN
U.S. State Department Analyst
- Go with the guerillas?
- With anybody.
The National Guard, the muchachos...
Want a drink? Yeah, you do.
Something big is in the wind.
Rebels are getting weapons
through Nicaragua.
They'll make a move soon, so any news
or photos you could throw my way...
No, that's stuff's hard to prove
and I hate doing that.
I'm not asking you to spook.
Just show them to me first.
You'll publish them anyway.
I hear they're getting it from the
black market, from government troops...
Last year.
This year Castro's got them organized.
I'm not messing around.
This is all Warsaw bloc stuff.
Jesus. Same old "Black Jack" Morgan.
You won't think it's a joke
when they take this place.
Nicaragua was just the beginning.
Guatemala and Honduras are next.
In five years you'll
see Cuban tanks on the Rio Grande.
Give me a break. I'm more worried
about Major Max on the Rio Grande.
Major Max may be
running things here soon.
So you'd better watch yourself, sport.
Jesus. Hey, could you
lend me 50 bucks?
- What?
- 50 bucks.
Tom!
Ambassador Kelly, how are you?
I'm Richard Boyle, PNS.
I was the last man out of Cambodia.
After Schamburg.
I wrote Flower of the Dragon.
I'm a friend of Captain Moore's.
THOMAS KELLY
U.S. Ambassador to El Salvador
Ambassador, does this Reagan thing
pose a problem for you?
Let me grab a couple of shots.
General, have you met Mr. Doyle?
Hello. Nice to meet you.
That's Boyle. Boyle.
Thanks.
ABC has projected
the next president...
...Ronald Reagan.
I gotta do a standup at 10,
boiling all this down.
You couldn't go far wrong saying:
"With Reagan in the saddle,
the guerillas are in deep shit."
That's lovely, Peter, but have you
seen the Journal today?
Here. It's real rah-rah democracy,
free elections, all that.
I think it's what
the networks want tonight.
So, what's your sign?
"Stop."
That's really cute.
I thought it was "Slippery When Wet."
This article and you, Pauline,
are 100 percent...
...and unequivocally full of shit.
Who's talking? You're so
full of shit I can't believe it.
- I resent...
- Know what I resent?
- I resent what we saw in Santa Ana.
- What was that?
A kid shot in the head and hung
because he didn't have his cédula.
- Know what a cédula is?
- Yeah.
If you're gonna analyze
a situation, analyze it right.
You don't have a cédula on
election day, stamped, you're dead.
What kind of democracy is it
when you have to vote...
...and if you don't you're branded
a Commie subversivo.
These people would vote
for Donald Duck...
...or whoever the local cop
tells them because if they don't...
...this is what happens.
You're a real pro. That's why you
can't last two weeks with a network.
Yuppies do a standup from the Camino
Real, they think they got the story.
City lights, my ass.
"My Two Weeks in El Salvador"
by Pauline Axelrod.
Oh, yeah.
"Whoring Through El Salvador"
by Richard Boyle.
Never with you,
blowjob queen of New York.
You're kissing all the right asses,
no wonder you're on the networks.
Excuse me.
- Pauline, I'm sorry.
- Fuck off!
Just be a sport. I'm an asshole!
I'm an asshole, all right?
Well, you don't have to worry
about her.
She's gonna boil it down real good.
I put 500 mics of acid
in her drink.
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.
With Ronald Reagan
sweeping the elections...
...here at the Camino Real Hotel...
Attention, residents of Escalon.
Ronald Reagan has been
elected President.
Finally, we have someone
in the White House with balls.
MAJOR MAXIMILIANO CASANOVA
(aka Major Max)
Presidential Candidate and Former
Director of Salvadoran Intelligence
The time has come for us, brothers...
...former members of Orden...
...patriots of the
Maximiliano Hernandez Brigade...
...and brothers of La Mano Blanca.
These fucking priests poisoning
the minds of our Salvadoran youth...
...are gonna be the first to bleed.
They are pig shit.
And this Romero
is the biggest pig shit of all.
A shitfaced desecration
of an archbishop.
And with this bullet...
...he will be the first to die.
For every one of our people
we will kill 100 of them.
We will avenge the deaths...
...of the South African ambassador...
...of Foreign Minister
Mauricio Borgenovo...
...of Roberto Cuoma...
...of Colonel Rosario,
of Gutierrez and Molina...
...and of the Mayor of El Paraiso.
These subversives that have sold our
country to the Communists will die.
Erlich, Zaun, Kelly, Duarte,
et cetera, et cetera.
And these pseudo journalists sent
by the Zionist-Communist conspiracy...
...to divide and confuse our people,
they will die.
Now...
...who will be the one...
...among you...
...to rid me of this Romero?
You will be famous.
As you well know...
...I stand for nationalism...
...law and order,
and economic prosperity.
More important...
...I stand for Church and family...
...and a peaceful Salvador.
There you go. You like that?
Yeah, rock 'n' roll.
Your tab is way high.
You owe me 400 colones.
I'm running a restaurant, not a bank.
I know, okay?
I got an NBC radio gig in the works...
...I got a CNN feed tomorrow,
I'm hot again.
Have I ever stiffed you in 10 years?
I'll pay you the whole thing
next week.
Okay. Don't tell Elena.
She'll kill me.
Besides that, could you throw in 100
colones cash, walking around money?
In front of Maria,
I don't want to look like a jerk.
- You're doing it to me again.
- I'll make it 750.
Okay, man.
...who are the masters of deception.
Christian Democrat green
on the outside...
...Moscow red on the inside.
What a clown!
Listen to your conscience.
Who is inflicting more violence?
Terrorists?
Carlos, come on. Get down.
This isn't funny. Come on.
I want to talk to you! Sit down.
It's getting dangerous here.
Yes, we're living in a bad time.
Like 1932 again, I detect
a bad feeling in the air.
This stuff's like white lightening.
You keep drinking that, you'll
end up in the street begging.
I'm not kidding you, you will.
You and your friends are really funny.
Yes, but you'd look better
without your balls.
How 'bout I cut yours off.
Who are you?
Get off the fucking car.
How about some beers for everybody?
Get in the car, Doc.
Get in the car, Doc.
Let's go to the beach,
I've got my pickup truck.
Me with you? Not even to church.
Why don't you ask your mother?
Hey! What are you doing?
Jesus.
Get in the car.
Doc, get in the car.
Where'd you get all those marks
on your face?
Couldn't keep your hands
off the blackheads in high school?
Could be death squad, got it?
Get in the car.
You can drop me here.
Where are you going?
I'm going with the guerrillas
in the mountains.
What will your parents say?
She knows.
It's not safe here anymore.
I go, okay?
You gonna join them?
In my country, amigo,
there is no more God.
They took Carlos and Dr. Rock!
They saw the marijuana!
Go in the house, I'll take care of it!
What are you talking about?
It's my brother!
I know it's your brother!
I'll take care of it.
Now get in the fucking house!
I'll take care of it!
Fuck!
Get me the fuck out of here!
You want to live? Shut up.
They're marihuanos. Subversives.
Doc, go, go!
Get out of here. Go.
Take him out.
And the other one?
No, he's a bad kid.
No respect.
He stays here.
Or you stay as well.
All right.
Carlos, just stay cool.
I'll get you out.
- Hi, Cathy, how are you?
- I'm fine.
- You look a little tired.
- I'm fine.
- Ambassador, Richard Boyle.
- Sir.
Good to see you again.
- You remember me?
- I certainly do.
I'm sorry, but I had actually written
two articles about you in Cambodia.
- Really?
- "Fall of Phnom Penh."
I was the last American
journalist out.
Schamberg gets his Pulitzer Prize,
and I almost got cholera...
...but we saved 1100 refugees
from the Khmer Rouge.
- Awful, what they did to that country.
- Yes, it was.
Are you one of the people portraying
them as the good guys for a while?
Yes, sir, I'm afraid
I was wrong there.
But a lot of people were.
If these guys running around
the hills took power...
...it'd be much worse than Pol Pot.
Are they as bad as Major Max
and the Mano Blanco?
I don't know.
A killer on the right, God knows what
on the left and a gutless middle.
Boyle, about your problem here...
Carol's checked the National Guard,
the Treasury Police, the Army.
Nobody seems to know anything
about this boy.
- Now we think...
- With all due respect...
...they're lying.
He didn't just disappear. Nobody
disappears here. They got him.
Carol, have you checked Human Rights?
Fuck the Human Rights office! They
rearranged this kid's molecules!
- Richard!
- He's dying out there, those fucks.
He's just a kid!
He's just a kid!
- Richard, please calm down.
- Okay, I'm sorry.
Ambassador, look, his sister...
...she's my girlfriend.
I've gotta get a cédula for her.
They could come tonight, take her away
and kill her too.
Richard! That doesn't have
anything to do with us.
You know the laws here.
She'll have to go back
to her hometown.
- Where's she from?
- Morazon, sir.
If she gets near there, the guards
will kill her as a suspected G. Fuck!
I'll do the best I can,
but it's very tough.
Everybody's in the same boat.
Thousands of people want a cédula.
Let me ask you this:
What if I married her?
Richard, you're already married.
Sir, I know you're busy.
Thank you for your time.
But this is El Salvador.
Suppose I just married her?
- I'll do whatever I can. I will.
- Thank you, sir.
- Maybe you could talk to Immigration?
- Just let me see what I can do.
Joan and I want to see you
at the Christmas party.
- Maybe I could keep in touch with you?
- Yeah, sure.
- I give up on you.
- What do you mean, give up?
- Every time I try to get something...
- This guy, he liked me.
- What's up?
- I gotta get Maria a cédula.
Maria.
They can't find Carlos, but the
ambassador is personally involved.
The thing is, though...
...you're in danger. Without a cédula
they can grab you, comprende?
So I've been thinking about something,
and what I think we should do...
- Marry me.
- What?
We could have a family.
Duglas and Reina and you and me.
- And Carlos, what about him?
- And Carlos, yes, when we find him.
- Si?
- You already have a wife?
No, that's been over, six months.
I got a divorce. I never told you.
- Hi, Boyle!
- Just a second.
- Hey, Peter.
- Atlanta's giving you a shot.
No!
- If you fuck up this time...
- Not a chance. That's great, man.
I want some real stuff on the G's.
- You set with Alvarez?
- We're like this.
You got the camera, the crew,
and the Arena press conference.
- Right, Major Max.
- He's gonna declare for president.
I'm going to Venezuela, so you'll
have to cover for me.
You're a mensch. Could you lend
me fifty bucks, man? I'm low.
You don't change, do you?
- This is what we got here.
- 100 would...
- 200 of them.
- 200 colones?
Out of my own pocket, so no whores.
- Do a good job, Boyle.
- Peter, you're a mensch, thanks.
- So what?
- I can't marry a divorced man.
And you, Richard,
are a bad Catholic in all ways.
How am I a bad Catholic?
- You're living in sin.
- No, I'm not.
- You drink.
- Okay, sometimes.
You sleep with many women.
- You smoke marijuana.
- No, that was Rock's.
And you lie, you scheme
and you scam.
What is good or decent about you?
What redemption can you expect?
Well, none. Okay, you got a point,
I am a fucking weasel.
But think about this:
If I went to Church...
I haven't been to Church in 30 years,
but we'd go to communion together...
Redemption, it'd be great!
We could go to Archbishop Romero.
He knows me
and likes me very much.
I could become a lay Catholic worker.
It'd be wonderful, I could...
This redemption thing feels good.
I feel cleansed already.
- You want some of this?
- No, no more marijuana.
It's possible Archbishop Romero
could annul my marriage to Claudia.
She was a Commie atheist anyway.
I'm gonna talk to him
about this, seriously.
Very good man.
Man of the people. Man of God.
He could win the Nobel Peace Prize.
Hey, what's this?
Another demonstration, Boyle?
Calm down, take it easy...
Stop... stop, please.
I have orders to evacuate the plaza
in five minutes. Do you understand me?
I have superior orders signed.
Why don't you stop the repression?
No matter... five minutes or violence.
Why don't you do something
about the Disappeared?
Violence! You understand me?
Stop the repression!
Do you follow in the way of Christ?
Not exactly.
I mean, in my heart, yes.
But I've done a lot of, you know...
...carnal sins, and...
...drunk a lot of alcohol,
and done some drugs.
I've weaseled around in my life,
trying to get the edge all the time.
But basically,
I'm a good-hearted person.
I haven't done anything
malicious in my life.
I haven't done anything great either.
I've tried to do things, find truths.
I do love this woman.
- For her, I'd...
- You'd change for this woman.
For this woman I'm willing to change.
I mean not just...
If God gave me this woman...
...then there must be a God.
So if He knows what's right,
then I'd do what's right by Him.
Just repent. Change your ways.
That's gonna be a little tough.
You love this woman,
you will be willing to change.
Okay, I can still drink...
...and take a few hits from a joint
once in a while, right? That's okay?
Twelve Our Fathers, ten Hail Marys,
and an Act of Contrition.
That's it?
Ask the Lord for forgiveness
from your heart.
From my heart.
If I'd known this, I would've come
earlier, before 33 years.
You should've come earlier.
- I'll come back.
- Next time don't wait so long.
The governing junta has good intentions
with their promises of land reform...
and their desire to control...
the so-called paramilitary forces
in the Army.
But, sadly, it is a failure...
because the power within the junta
is the Army...
and the Army itself is an obstacle
to the reign of God.
They know only how to repress
the people...
and defend the interests
of the rich oligarchy.
I have called upon the United States,
repeatedly...
to stop all military aid to this Army...
until it satisfactorily resolves
the problems of the Disappeared...
and submits itself to
civilian control.
When a dictatorship
seriously violates human rights...
and attacks the common good
of the nation...
When it becomes unbearable
and closes all channels of dialogue...
When this happens,
the Church speaks...
of the legitimate right
of insurrectional violence!
We are poor.
You in Washington are so rich.
Why are you so blind?
My children...
you must look to yourselves...
in this sad time for Salvador.
I wish to close with an appeal
to the men of the Army...
and in particular, the National Guard.
Brothers, you are part of your people.
Yet you kill your own
brothers and sisters.
But before a man may kill,
the law of God must prevail.
And that law says,
"Thou shalt not kill."
No soldier is obliged to obey an order
against the law of God.
Violence on all sides is wrong.
Violence is wrong.
In the name of God, and in the name
of this suffering people...
Whose laments rise to Heaven
each day more tumultuous...
I beg you...
I ask you...
I order you in the name of God...
Stop the repression!
Arrest him for the murder
of Archbishop Romero.
Taxi! Taxi!
You will note, I did not agree
with the bishop.
He sometimes got carried away
with his politics.
He did not understand
that with the Left in power...
...there will be no Church
in this country.
And he will be out of a job.
In my book, it was the subversives
that killed him.
No question. To provoke
this atmosphere, this cause.
It's rumored that you're head of the
death squads terrorizing the city.
Care to comment?
- You're pressing your luck, Boyle.
- Nice going, Boyle.
I really resent that question.
Get the fuck off.
Why do you never ask
the Communist leaders?
They are not the only victims.
We have victims too.
They know there are no death squads
in El Salvador.
The outrage of the people against
the Communist threat...
...cannot be stopped
or organized by anyone.
Sir, the polls show you trailing
the Christian Democrats.
Are you sure you can capture both
the Catholic and the woman's vote?
Bullshit question. Saves a tape.
Do you mind? I'm gonna buy it
for my sister. Looks nice.
Oh, here he comes. Mr. Gomez?
Mr. Gomez, question, please.
Get him, get him.
No interviews with this piece of shit.
What are you gonna do about it, fatso?
This is not going to fly.
Think about your image.
Shit about your image.
I'll cut your balls off, Boyle!
Do it yourself, huh?
Huh, you chicken shit?
Hi, you guys from Washington? Huh?
You're a real pro, Boyle.
Doc! Doc, where's Maria?
Boyle! They found Carlos, man.
- Where?
- He's fucked up.
Over there, man, he's really
fucked up bad.
- Maria, please.
- Don't touch me!
He was acting stupid! Why blame me?
Ever since you've gotten here
there's been nothing but problems.
It wasn't my fault!
Great going, Boyle. Have a drink.
Damn it.
I really love her, man. I mean...
...she and the kids were the only
decent thing I ever had in my life.
I don't know why I'm living anymore.
That's all I got is 10.
- Fifteen.
- I was only in there for five minutes.
That guy kept interrupting me.
I would have been out of there faster.
All I got is 10.
Okay, 10.
You asshole.
I'll give you 50 percent interest.
- Know what you said?
- Huh?
That you'd pay her
in two menstrual cycles, you moron.
I'm sure you don't need it,
and I can't say I approve, but...
...merry Christmas, Richard.
Get over here. Get over here.
Get over here.
Oh, Richard.
Cathy, talk to Maria.
I need Maria. Talk to Father Paul.
She listens to him.
You're old enough to be her father.
Forget her.
I'm in love with her.
I love you, Richie.
Father Paul has to follow
the papal orders, there's nothing...
I hate that.
I hate when you do that so much.
- What about your other wife and kid?
- She left me. She took my kid.
So you're going to bring Maria
back with you?
What's she gonna do, Richard?
Sell snow cones on Fisherman's Wharf?
Down here she has a purpose.
Up there she's a fish out of water.
Yeah, I know.
You don't have enough money
to support the kid you've already got.
I need to talk to you about
my whole life, it's such a mess.
- It's disgusting.
- You're disgusting.
What are you doing here?
- You're not making it as a journalist.
- I'll make it again.
I will make it again.
The white hand's been painted
on the parish house wall.
Your altar boy is dead.
Even the Peace Corps has moved out.
I love it here.
I just can't go back.
I know. I love it here too.
- Can you have dinner with me?
- No.
- Tomorrow night?
- No, I can't. Besides, you smell.
I'm going to the airport tomorrow.
Two nuns are coming in.
Sometime?
Maybe.
- Be careful on the way to the airport.
- Yeah.
Wait a minute,
I'll walk you to your car.
- Merry Christmas, Richard.
- Bye.
- You be good.
- I will.
- I don't trust you.
- I will be.
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Bye.
Gringo.
Let's take a walk
down by the beach, gringo.
I'm not going to the beach with you.
I'll tell you something else, I'm not
only a fucking Irishman, I'm...
...I'm a fucking Viking.
I'll take as many of these creeps
to fucking Valhalla as I can!
You got a big mouth.
Major Max has got a present for you.
Come to the beach.
Come on, cocksucker,
you'll have to fucking kill me!
You ain't fucking taking me alive!
Come on!
You want to play
a fucking game, Boyle?
Okay, first I'll take your arms...
...then I'll take your legs...
...then your balls.
Sound like a fun game?
Okay, cocksuckers,
how do you like these odds, huh?
He's worthless.
You are an important man, Jefe.
A photograph for me?
Enough!
Boyle, I'll be back for you.
Fuck you!
Yeah, up yours too, Jack.
- How was Nicaragua?
- Oh, bad.
There's no gasoline.
People line up for hours to get food.
Worse than...
Very, very destructive.
On the other hand, there's been
no political execution of Somazastias.
I can't believe this.
Get your passports ready.
What's the matter?
We have done nothing!
I'm a good friend of Ambassador Kelly.
You'll be in a lot of trouble.
The bodies of four American women
missing since Tuesday were found...
...here today, at a roadside grave...
...25 miles east of San Salvador.
The victims were identified as...
I just heard five guards did it for
15 colones and a bottle of Tic Tack.
And they got this clown mayor
to sign the death certificates.
- Will he talk?
- If we can keep him alive.
- What are the chances of that?
- Slim to none, and he knows it.
He had no business signing
without an autopsy.
I want to know if those bullets
are rebel or government!
You knew Cathy well, didn't you?
What do you think?
Rumor has it they ran a roadblock
and there was an exchange of gunfire.
He says the doctors won't do it
because they don't...
- They don't have their masks.
- Masks, huh?
Okay, pal. All right.
We're cutting off all aid as of today.
Sir, they were coming from Managua,
and they were Communist-oriented.
Maybe they got spooked at the
roadblock, maybe they were packing.
Pistol-packing nuns, my ass.
I knew Cathy.
You can't sell me that shit.
General Garcia has assured me
of a complete investigation.
Have the fox investigate
the chicken coop, huh?
You must think I'm stupid, colonel.
I know all about you.
Reagan's team coming down here to talk
to Max without checking with me.
It's all going in my report.
You gave a clear signal to the
Arana people that resulted in this.
We want to do a real in-depth
and sympathetic portrait.
For the first time
our armies are united.
We now control a third
of Chatalengo in the west...
COMANDANTE MARTI Nom de Guerre
Field Commander, Rebel Army
...and Morazon Province in the east.
We want the people and all government
troops to join our final offense.
We'll take all major cities.
Santa Ana, San Vicente, San Miguel.
Then San Salvador will fall.
When, captain?
Before Reagan.
And you think you're ready?
With 4000 troops,
take all of El Salvador?
The Pentagon won't let it happen.
The will of the people and the march
of history cannot be changed.
Not even by the Norteamericanos.
What does it say?
"Leticia cleans her gun."
- Careful on the way out.
- Don't worry, I have experience.
- I'm serious.
- Thanks.
- Good luck.
- Okay, bye. Thank you.
This doesn't show much.
I stuck my neck out for you, Boyle.
You're not too popular around here.
- Where were these taken?
- I can't tell you, but it's old stuff.
Shotguns, bolt action rifles,
captured Belgian FLNs.
Fifty cals, 120 mike-mikes
taken from government troops.
- Any anti-aircraft stuff? Any SAMs?
- Nothing.
How about it? How about a cédula
for my woman and her two kids?
There's not much, or you're
not saying everything.
Christ!
What about recoilless rifles, RPGs?
They're in shit shape,
getting nothing.
When will you believe
what your eyes see...
...and not what Intelligence
tells you to think?
We got AWACs, infrareds, statements
from a defecting FRAN commandant...
...and enough military intel to
prove 10,000 percent...
...that this ain't no civil war,
but Commie aggression.
You've been lying about
that from the beginning.
You've not presented one shred of
proof to the American public...
...that this is anything but
a legitimate peasant revolution.
Don't tell me about the sanctity
of military intelligence.
Not after Chile and Vietnam.
I was there, remember?
I personally resent that kind of shit.
Then resent it, okay?
You've lied about the advisers here.
- Lied about the trainers on TTY.
- Bullshit!
You're lying about switching
humanitarian assistance money...
...to Salvadoran military coffers.
It's a lie that this war can be
won militarily, it can't.
Of course it can.
Calm down, Boyle.
I'm sorry about this.
I'm not gonna listen to this wino
journalist's left-wing Commie crap.
We know where this guy's sympathies
lie. Why are we talking to him?
Look, Richard, you saw Martin.
We know they're starting
some kind of an offensive.
I'm not a fucking spy for you guys.
Left-wing, colonel? Well, maybe.
But I'm not a Communist, and you guys
are never able to tell the difference.
- Is that a fact?
- Yeah.
I love my country the same as you.
That may surprise you.
You're the ones who trained Major Max
at the police academy.
You trained Jose Medrano
and Rene Chacon.
Trained them to torture and kill,
then sent them here.
What did Chacon give us?
He gave us the Mano Blanco.
What are the death squads,
but the brainchild of the CIA?
- You like that they're anti-Moscow.
- Bullshit!
You let them close the universities,
wipe out the best minds.
You let them wipe out
the Catholic Church.
You let them do it all
because they aren't Commies.
And that, colonel, is bullshit.
You've created a major Frankenstein.
We can control him.
Like you control the Major Maxes...
- Well, look who's here.
- Hi.
What about Pol Pot and Castro?
Are they any better?
Pol Pot and Castro?
I don't know if they're better.
All I know is that some campecino
who can't read or write...
...or feed his family, has to watch
his kid die of malnutrition.
You think he gives a shit
about Marxism or capitalism?
It was that kind of crap thinking that
lost us Vietnam, this guilt shit.
You liberal assholes. What do you
think the KGB's doing, huh?
Is that why you're here?
Some kind of post-Vietnam experience,
like you need a rerun?
You pour $120 million in here and
turn it into a military zone.
- So you can have chopper parades?
- You're blowing it out your ass.
You're only bringing misery
to these people.
I don't want to see another Vietnam.
I don't want to see America
get another bad rap.
I lost my hearing in this ear
over there, and for what?
Fifteen dollars a photo
from Pacific News Service?
I did it because
I believe in America.
I believe that we stand
for something.
For a constitution.
For human rights, not just
for a few people...
...but for everybody on this planet.
You gotta think of the people first.
In the name of human decency, something
Americans are supposed to believe in.
You've got to try to make
something of a just society here.
Look, Richard, it's all part of our
national plan.
We do a lot of good down here.
I'm often asked by people like
you to examine my conscience...
...and I do examine it.
- And what do you find, Jack?
That whatever mistakes we make
down here...
...the alternative would be ten
times worse.
Maybe I'll just, like, forge
a cédula for my girlfriend...
They're on the house.
Boyle.
Boyle!
There's something you should know.
My Salvo counterparts are mighty
pissed about some periodistas...
...going out with the terrorists.
If they can catch one,
they'll make a lesson out of him.
Look, I'll get out of your hair.
Just get me a cédula for my girlfriend
and her two kids, I'm gone.
Getting a cédula for your whore
is the least of your problems.
Personally, I don't give a shit
if they kill you or not.
I happen to hate the species
you belong to.
But I'm telling you,
they're serious.
If I were you, I'd get my rubber
shoes on and get to the airport.
You'll fit in here really well,
you know that?
You sound just like another gangster.
Dumb fuck!
...a panning shot for the beginning
of the interview, okay?
Come over here.
- Can you tell me your name?
- Sorry, we can't speak to the press.
Thank you, private. I appreciate it.
- Can you tell me your name?
- No, I'm sorry, I cannot.
- How about where you're from?
- Okay. Long Island, New York.
Well, welcome to El Salvador,
what do you think?
It's not bad, but I'm anxious
to watch the Giants' game.
- Know where a TV is?
- I don't know.
Thanks, soldier.
Excuse me, colonel.
Pauline Axelrod, ANS News.
Does this signal a buildup of
U.S. combat troops here in El Salvador?
Ma'am, these are not combat troops.
They're trainers,
officially authorized by Congress.
- No further comment.
- Thank you, sir.
This is Pauline Axelrod,
ANS News, San Salvador.
Listen, you got one thing
going for you...
...and that's
Maria still cares about you.
She does.
If I were you, I'd straighten out my
act and go back to her on my knees.
Doc, please.
All right, just trying to help you.
Doc!
- Wilma! Hi, how are you?
- Fine.
Boyle, did you meet Wilma?
- Is this Wilma from the Panama Club?
- Well, she straightened up her act.
And look at this.
Bagel II, huh?
That's great, Doc.
- Come on. Let's go.
- She wants to take me shopping.
- Do something about these drinks?
- Let me... Just a couple bucks.
- What's this?
- She had a long career.
- Thanks.
- See you.
- Rich, you still got your wheels?
- Yeah.
The G's just hit Santa Ana.
- Wait, I gotta stop in the Libertad.
- No.
- I gotta see Maria.
- No.
Then go without me.
All right, come on.
Shit!
Oh, fuck.
Sign!
Oh, fuck me.
John!
Look!
John, wait! Shit.
Crazy...!
John!
Fuck.
You crazy fucking fool!
You're not that magic!
Today I am, Boyle.
The Sandanistas have entered the war.
Equipment's being unloaded at Fonteca.
- Possibly troops too.
- Any backup?
No time. Santa Ana's fallen.
The country's split.
The First Army's wiped out.
It's deteriorating very fast.
El Salvador will fall in 48 hours.
In 24. Their air force
has no ammo, no gas.
We restore military aid
or go to Phase Three.
The 82nd Airborne's on alert
and Marines are in position.
- God almighty.
- What do you want to do?
I won't get steamrolled into this.
Get substantiation on Nicaragua.
That would take days.
If we don't give the order
to evacuate soon...
...I can't be responsible
for the safety of the embassy...
...or the American community here.
Listen, Tom...
...we know you're leaving
in a few days, that's not the issue.
The issue is, do you want to go down
in the history books...
...as the man who lost El Salvador?
That's hardly the issue!
We're talking about human lives!
We're not playing some computer game!
Jesus, history books!
God!
The line is dead, sir.
Where the fuck are the Americans?
Sir...
...you have a decision to make.
All right.
Okay.
I'll recommend that we restore
all military aid.
Give the order to release
the fuel and arms runs to Ilopango.
Yes, sir.
Figueroa's broken through.
They're coming! Tanks!
Don't let Figueroa pass!
I'll hold the front.
- What about the prisoners?
- I'll take care of them.
My 120's fucked up.
Tanks?
Panhards.
Shit!
Can you lay two more rolls
of Tri-X on me?
No pictures.
Is this your justice?
It's necessary.
Get them out of here.
You've become just like them!
This is war! You don't have
the stomach for it...
...get out!
You've become just like them.
Oh, fucker! Fucker!
You believe this?
John, no!
John!
Oh, Jesus, God.
Oh, God, John.
Why'd you want to put your...
Don't move.
Don't move.
Breathe out.
Breathe out.
Can you breathe?
Can you breathe?
Can you breathe?
I got the shot, Boyle.
You got the shot.
- Take it to New York.
- I'll get it to New York.
Got it.
Oh, Jesus, God.
You got the magic shot.
You got it. You're the best.
We fucked up, didn't we?
Don't wipe it on your thing,
clean it!
Rich, you okay?
Doc, give me a Valium, anything.
I got something for you.
- Here's two.
- Thank you.
Goddamn, that looks horrible.
Hey, hey! Where you going?
Where you going?
- Is it okay?
- It's all right. It'll be all right.
I got some good news for you.
Look, the bruja gave me some
cédulas for Maria and the kids.
She did a pretty good job.
And look, I got your exit visa
forged too.
She kind of fucked up on that,
but I think it's gonna be all right.
- Thank you.
- It'll work.
You gotta get out of here, man.
The police were over at Roberto's
looking for you.
They say you're
in the country illegally.
Roberto said he thinks you're dead.
You got to get out of here.
When we get there, hang back.
If there's any trouble, call Kelly.
If Kelly's gone, Morgan will help.
Got it?
I heard you the first time. I know.
Take care, don't stay here too long.
Don't become a Tic Tack monster.
They kill people here.
You believe everything
you read in the papers?
I'll miss you, Doc.
I'll miss you too.
Is that my watch?
Give it to me for the border.
Cheap son of a bitch.
Say hi to gringo-land for me,
all right?
You guys be careful.
It's fake.
Look, I'm not gonna bullshit you,
all right? It was a rush job.
I have to get to America.
I'm an important journalist.
Newsweek. Understand?
Newsweek. Time.
CBS. Big shot.
It's very important.
Where's he going?
Capital. You know... Oh, God.
I have a very important appointment
in the capital...
...with Ambassador Kelly
and Mr. Jose Duarte.
Why don't you hold that...
I'm a big fan
of the Raiders, actually.
The ambassador, you know?
United States Embassy.
I like the White Hand a lot.
Tremble, tremble, Communists,
with the instincts of animals...
The Mano Blanco doesn't hate you,
but you make trouble for Mr. Gomez.
Willie Gomez is a friend of mine.
That's why he wants you dead?
Oh, God, not that film!
That's the best war film of the year!
Cassady died getting it,
you motherfucker!
He died getting that film!
Fuck you! Fuck you, cocksuckers!
Boyle is about to fucking die.
And if he does, if he does...
...your next job will be in Rwanda
counting fucking spears, understand?!
Get the ambassador on the phone!
Okay, I'm not kidding.
I got $50,000 in traveler's checks.
They're hidden, like,
two kilometers from here.
You lie, you stupid gringo.
Don't castrate him in here.
You'll make a mess. Shoot him.
You tell General Martinez...
...that I am still the ambassador
to this country for another day.
I want those people out of there now...
...or I'll make it the worst day
of his fucking life. You got that?
Okay, fuck it.
Let's get it over with.
Are you kidding?
A little American trick here.
You know what that means?
You're all stupid cocksuckers.
I hope you get anal herpes.
Next?
Where've you been?
We just went to Nogales
for the afternoon with the family.
- Did you take the roast out?
- Yes, I took care of it.
When are we going to Disneyland?
I don't know, next month.
He's getting spoiled, I'm telling you.
- Okay. Next?
- Great. Thanks.
Come on.
I always dreamed
to come to California.
It's a wacko joint.
Not like El Salvador.
You can be what you want,
do what you want...
...as long as you got the money.
Maybe I'll get some of my
Salvador stories published.
I could write a story on John.
I think we're gonna be okay.
I think we're gonna be okay.
Why are we stopping here?
Please don't be alarmed,
just a routine Immigration check.
May I see your I.D., sir?
Yeah, sure.
Will a driver's license do?
We just went to Nogales for the day.
Is that right? Are you his wife?
- What is he saying?
- Yes, she is. Is there a problem?
- May I see some identification?
- What is he saying?
What is the problem here?
Look, she's with me.
She's been through hell.
I'm a journalist, she's my researcher.
I don't understand the problem.
Come with me. Bring your children.
Wait a minute. What are you doing?
Sit down, sir, please.
- Wait a minute.
- Hey, sit down.
I'll sit down, but she's...
Richard, stop it. I go.
- But Maria, wait.
- I go. I be all right.
Just take care of yourself.
If you send her back, they will
kill her, rape her and mutilate her.
If you send her back there...
If you send the kids,
they'll kill them.
You don't know what it's like!
- You're under arrest.
- You have no idea what it's like!
- Move it!
- You have no idea!
Check point.
Three illegals. One female Latino...
...and two children.
Bringing them in.
One WMA. One Boyle, Richard...
...birthdate 2-26-43.
Check. Ten-four.
Get him in.
