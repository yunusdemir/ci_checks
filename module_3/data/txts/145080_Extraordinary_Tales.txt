DEATH: <i> Well, if it isn't</i>
<i>my good friend, the poet.</i>
<i>I can't say I'm surprised</i>
<i>to find you here.</i>
<i>Whose grave</i>
<i>are you visiting today?</i>
Who's there?
DEATH: <i> Weeping at the same</i>
<i>grave over again?</i>
<i>Why didn't you choose any</i>
<i>of the others?</i>
<i>Ligeia, Annabel?</i>
<i>Or perhaps Berenice?</i>
<i>So, sure, Virginia</i>
<i>was going to be the pick</i>
<i>for today's tortured journey.</i>
<i>There's no denying</i>
<i>your affection for her.</i>
<i>What was that poem of yours?</i>
<i>"It was many and many</i>
<i>a year ago</i>
<i>"That a maiden there lived</i>
<i>whom you may know</i>
<i>"And this maiden she lived</i>
<i>with no other thought..."</i>
"Than to love
and be loved by me"
What am I doing?
I recite poetry with a statue!
I must be drunk.
Or mad.
DEATH: <i> Or both.</i>
I am hallucinating.
DEATH: <i> Should I</i>
<i>answer this one</i>
<i>with another of your stanzas?</i>
<i>"All that we see or seem</i>
<i>"Is but a dream</i>
<i>within a dream"</i>
<i>Still, you have no clue</i>
<i>to who I am.</i>
<i>I am your shadow, your soul.</i>
<i>The object of your obsession.</i>
Are you mad?
My obsession?
DEATH: <i> Recognize me now, Poe?</i>
<i>Are you feeling lonely?</i>
<i>Longing again</i>
<i>for the departed?</i>
Silence!
I came here for solitude.
Not loneliness.
(CREAKING)
DEATH: <i> Always obsessed</i>
<i>with the dead.</i>
<i>A great subject</i>
<i>for your writings.</i>
It is not obsession,
but rather inspiration
which drives my writing.
DEATH: <i> I wouldn't</i>
<i>define it that way.</i>
<i>Remember Roderick Usher?</i>
<i>His compulsive obsession</i>
<i>for his departed sister,</i>
<i>Madeline</i>
<i>caused such a nervous</i>
<i>agitation</i>
<i>that it lead him</i>
<i>to an early demise.</i>
It was brotherly love,
not obsession.
DEATH: <i> Obsession,</i>
<i>superstition,</i>
<i>unrequited love.</i>
<i>Who do you want to convince?</i>
FREDERICK: <i> It was</i>
<i>a magical place</i>
<i>that filled my childhood</i>
<i>with visions</i>
<i>to stir the imagination.</i>
<i>And now, during the whole</i>
<i>of a dull, dark,</i>
<i>and soundless day</i>
<i>in the autumn of another year,</i>
<i>I was alone, passing through</i>
<i>a singularly dreary tract</i>
<i>of country,</i>
<i>and at length, found myself</i>
<i>within reach of the melancholy</i>
<i>House of Usher.</i>
<i>-I know not how it was...</i>
-(WHINNYING)
<i>But with my first glimpse</i>
<i>of the house after so long,</i>
<i>an unexpected sense</i>
<i>of insufferable gloom</i>
<i>pervaded my spirit.</i>
-(NEIGHS)
<i>-What was it?</i>
<i>What unnerved me so</i>
<i>in the contemplation</i>
<i>of the House of Usher?</i>
<i>Its proprietor,</i>
<i>Roderick Usher,</i>
<i>had been one of my boon</i>
<i>companions in boyhood,</i>
<i>but many years had elapsed</i>
<i>since our last meeting.</i>
<i>His letter, however,</i>
<i>had lately reached me in</i>
<i>a distant part of the country.</i>
<i>I scanned more narrowly</i>
<i>the real aspect</i>
<i>of the building.</i>
<i>Its principal feature</i>
<i>seemed to be that</i>
<i>of an excessive antiquity.</i>
<i>The writer spoke</i>
<i>of acute bodily illness,</i>
<i>of a mental disorder</i>
<i>which oppressed him</i>
<i>and brought an earnest</i>
<i>desire to see me,</i>
<i>as his best, and indeed,</i>
<i>his only personal friend,</i>
<i>in an attempt to alleviate</i>
<i>some of his malady,</i>
<i>and I, accordingly,</i>
<i>obeyed forthwith</i>
<i>what I still considered</i>
<i>a very singular</i>
<i>and haunting summons.</i>
(BOTTLE ROLLING ON FLOOR)
<i>I gazed upon him with</i>
<i>a feeling, half of pity,</i>
<i>half of awe.</i>
Frederick!
My dear friend.
I have after all this time
been waiting for your arrival.
FREDERICK: <i> I, at first,</i>
<i>thought it to be</i>
<i>an overdone cordiality.</i>
<i>It was with difficulty</i>
<i>that I could bring myself</i>
<i>to admit the identity</i>
<i>of the man being before me</i>
<i>with the companion</i>
<i>of my early boyhood.</i>
<i>He entered into what</i>
<i>he conceived to be the nature</i>
<i>of his malady.</i>
<i>The most insipid food</i>
<i>was alone endurable.</i>
<i>The odors of all flowers</i>
<i>proved oppressive.</i>
<i>His eyes were tortured</i>
<i>by even a faint light.</i>
<i>And there were</i>
<i>but peculiar sounds</i>
<i>which inspired him</i>
<i>with horror.</i>
-(CHAIR SQUEAKS)
-(SCREAMS)
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
<i>I began to question</i>
<i>my worthiness</i>
<i>of being present</i>
<i>for my friend,</i>
<i>who now existed in a world</i>
<i>of which I held no key.</i>
I shall perish!
I dread the events
of the future!
I feel that the period
will sooner or later arrive
when I must abandon
life and reason together,
in some struggle with the...
With the grim phantasm.
Fear.
But what do you fear,
Roderick?
I must know what is it
that torments
your every moment.
I admit that
much of the peculiar
gloom which afflicts me
could be traced
to a severe
and long continued illness.
I speak of my tenderly
beloved sister, Madeline.
My sole companion
for so many long years,
my last
and only relative on Earth.
FREDERICK: <i> Roderick spoke</i>
<i>with such bitterness,</i>
<i>which made me shudder.</i>
<i>And yet, I could tell</i>
<i>of his complete devotion</i>
<i>towards his sister.</i>
Madeline...
Her decease
will leave me as the last
of the ancient race
of the Ushers.
FREDERICK: <i> His voice trembled</i>
<i>as he recounted how even</i>
<i>in her youth,</i>
<i>Madeline would fear</i>
<i>the outside world.</i>
<i>Roderick loved his sister</i>
<i>for her purity,</i>
<i>but the foreboding doom</i>
<i>was forever present.</i>
<i>The Ushers' life of loneliness</i>
<i>will mean there will</i>
<i>be no heir.</i>
<i>But on the closing in</i>
<i>of the evening of my arrival</i>
<i>at the house,</i>
<i>she succumbed</i>
<i>to the prostrating power</i>
<i>of the destroyer.</i>
(BANGING ON DOOR)
She is dead!
Madeline has died.
She has left me!
(RODERICK SOBBING SOFTLY)
(CRACKING)
FREDERICK: <i> At the request</i>
<i>of Roderick Usher,</i>
<i>I personally aided him</i>
<i>in the arrangements</i>
<i>for the temporary entombment.</i>
(WALLS CRUMBLING)
<i>And now,</i>
<i>some days of bitter grief</i>
<i>having elapsed,</i>
<i>an observable change</i>
<i>came over the features of the</i>
<i>mental disorder of my friend.</i>
<i>At times, again,</i>
<i>I was obliged to resolve all</i>
<i>into the mere inexplicable</i>
<i>vagaries of madness.</i>
<i>For I beheld him</i>
<i>gazing upon vacancy</i>
<i>for long hours,</i>
<i>in an attitude</i>
<i>of the profoundest attention,</i>
<i>as if listening to some</i>
<i>imaginary sound.</i>
FEMALE VOICE:
(WHISPERING) <i> Roderick.</i>
<i>Roderick.</i>
FREDERICK: <i> It was no wonder</i>
<i>that his terrifying condition</i>
<i>was creeping upon me,</i>
<i>the wild influence</i>
<i>of his fantastic,</i>
<i>yet impressive superstitions.</i>
And you have not seen it?
Then you shall!
You must...
You must behold this!
I hear it, and have heard it.
We have put her,
living,
in the tomb!
I now tell you
that I heard her first
feeble movements
in the hollow coffin.
I heard them many,
many days ago.
Yet I dared not...
I dare not speak!
The rending of her coffin,
and the grating of the
iron hinges of her prison,
and her struggles
within the coppered
archway of the vault!
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
Be calm.
It is the storm that draws
breath,
playing tricks on us both!
Is she not hurrying
to upbraid me for my haste?
Have I not heard
her footsteps on the stairs?
Do I not distinguish
that heavy
and horrible
beating
of her heart?
Madman!
Madman!
(FEMALE VOICE
WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY)
(SCREAMS)
I tell you that she now stands
without the door!
FREDERICK: <i> The vision</i>
<i>before me</i>
<i>will stay burned</i>
<i>into my very soul</i>
<i>and haunt me</i>
<i>to the end of my days.</i>
(RUMBLING)
(RUMBLING)
<i>Where I gazed,</i>
<i>the house once stood.</i>
<i>I saw the mighty walls rushing</i>
<i>as under there was a long,</i>
<i>tumultuous shouting sound,</i>
<i>like the voice</i>
<i>of 1,000 waters,</i>
<i>and the deep and dank tarn</i>
<i>at my feet</i>
<i>closed sullenly and silently</i>
<i>over the fragments</i>
<i>of the House of Usher.</i>
DEATH: <i> Bravo!</i>
<i>In your own words, he became</i>
<i>a victim of the very terrors</i>
<i>he had anticipated.</i>
<i>Much like you.</i>
<i>Don't you wish you were dead?</i>
Why should I? I want to live.
I have more stories to tell.
DEATH: <i> Your time is up</i>
<i>in your world.</i>
<i>You have nothing to lose,</i>
<i>no one to love.</i>
<i>Stop feeling guilty</i>
<i>for other people's death.</i>
<i>Virginia died in spite</i>
<i>of your care or your love.</i>
<i>Your mother succumbed</i>
<i>to my power,</i>
<i>leaving you helplessly alone.</i>
(SIGHS) I was so young
when she died.
I was denied even the memory
of her face.
DEATH: <i> Guilt never</i>
<i>leads to any good.</i>
<i>If anything, you are haunted.</i>
<i>Haunted by sorrow,</i>
<i>guilty not of a crime, but of</i>
<i>the inability to stop me.</i>
(SCOFFS) If anything,
I am guilty of giving
my readers what they want.
A glimpse of redemption,
stories with a moral where
justice always triumphs.
DEATH: <i> Is this what you mean?</i>
NARRATOR: <i> It is impossible</i>
<i>to say how first</i>
<i>the idea entered my brain,</i>
<i>but once conceived,</i>
<i>it haunted me day and night.</i>
<i>Object,</i>
<i>there was none,</i>
<i>but I loved the old man.</i>
<i>He had never wronged me.</i>
<i>He had never given me insult,</i>
<i>and for his money,</i>
<i>I had no desire.</i>
<i>I think it was his eye!</i>
<i>Yes, that was it.</i>
<i>One of his eyes resembled</i>
<i>that of a vulture.</i>
<i>I made up my mind</i>
<i>to take the life</i>
<i>of the old man,</i>
<i>and thus, rid myself</i>
<i>of the eye forever.</i>
<i>You should have seen</i>
<i>how wisely I proceeded,</i>
<i>with what caution</i>
<i>and foresight I went to work.</i>
<i>And every night,</i>
<i>about midnight,</i>
<i>I turned the latch on his door</i>
<i>and opened it.</i>
<i>And when my head was</i>
<i>well in the room,</i>
<i>I undid the lantern</i>
<i>cautiously,</i>
<i>oh, so cautiously.</i>
<i>I undid it just so much</i>
<i>that a single thin ray</i>
<i>fell upon the vulture eye.</i>
<i>But I found the eye always</i>
<i>closed.</i>
<i>And so, it was impossible</i>
<i>to do the work.</i>
<i>For it was not the old man</i>
<i>who vexed me.</i>
<i>It was his evil eye.</i>
<i>I was never kinder</i>
<i>to the old man than during</i>
<i>the whole week</i>
<i>before I killed him.</i>
<i>And this I did</i>
<i>for seven long nights.</i>
<i>Every night, just at midnight.</i>
<i>But I found the eye</i>
<i>always closed.</i>
<i>Upon the eighth night,</i>
<i>I was more than usually</i>
<i>cautious in opening the door.</i>
<i>A watch's minute hand</i>
<i>moves more quickly</i>
<i>than did mine.</i>
<i>When I was about to open</i>
<i>the lantern,</i>
<i>my thumb slipped</i>
<i>upon the tin fastening</i>
<i>and the old man sprang up</i>
<i>in bed crying out,</i>
<i>"Who's there?"</i>
<i>He had been trying</i>
<i>to fancy them causeless.</i>
<i>He had been saying to himself,</i>
<i>"It is nothing but the wind</i>
<i>in the chimney.</i>
<i>"It is only a mouse crossing</i>
<i>the floor."</i>
<i>But all in vain.</i>
<i>Then, there came to my ears</i>
<i>a low, dull, quick sound</i>
<i>such as a watch makes</i>
<i>when enveloped in cotton.</i>
<i>I knew that sound well.</i>
<i>It was the beating</i>
<i>of the old man's heart.</i>
<i>Meantime, the hellish tattoo</i>
<i>of the heart increased.</i>
<i>It grew quicker and quicker,</i>
<i>and louder and louder</i>
<i>every instant.</i>
<i>The old man's hour had come!</i>
<i>He shrieked once, only once.</i>
(HEARTBEAT ECHOING SOFTLY)
<i>The old man was dead.</i>
<i>His eye would trouble me</i>
<i>no more.</i>
<i>If still you think me mad,</i>
<i>you will think no longer</i>
<i>when I describe</i>
<i>the wise precautions I took</i>
<i>for the concealment</i>
<i>of the body.</i>
<i>First of all,</i>
<i>I dismembered the corpse.</i>
<i>I then took up three planks</i>
<i>from the flooring</i>
<i>and deposited all</i>
<i>between the scantlings.</i>
<i>I then replaced the boards</i>
<i>so cleverly, so cunningly,</i>
<i>that no human eye could</i>
<i>detect anything wrong.</i>
<i>There entered three men,</i>
<i>who introduced themselves</i>
<i>as officers of the police.</i>
<i>A shriek had been heard by</i>
<i>a neighbor during the night</i>
<i>and they had been deputed</i>
<i>to search the premises.</i>
<i>I bade the gentleman welcome.</i>
<i>The shriek, I said,</i>
<i>was my own in a dream.</i>
<i>The old man, I mentioned,</i>
<i>was absent in the country.</i>
<i>The officers were satisfied.</i>
<i>My manner had convinced them.</i>
<i>But, ere long,</i>
<i>I felt myself getting pale</i>
<i>and I wished them gone.</i>
<i>My head ached</i>
<i>and I fancied a ringing</i>
<i>in my ears.</i>
(HIGH-PITCHED RINGING)
(HEARTBEAT ECHOING SOFTLY)
<i>I found that the noise</i>
<i>was not within my ears.</i>
(HEARTBEAT CONTINUES)
<i>I gasped for breath,</i>
<i>and yet, the officers</i>
<i>heard it not.</i>
<i>Why would they not be gone?</i>
(HEARTBEAT GROWING LOUDER)
<i>Oh, God!</i>
<i>What could I do?</i>
<i>Was it possible</i>
<i>they heard not?</i>
<i>No! No!</i>
<i>They heard,</i>
<i>they suspected!</i>
<i>They knew!</i>
<i>They were making mockery</i>
<i>of my horror.</i>
<i>Villains!</i>
<i>I shrieked,</i>
<i>"I admit the deed!</i>
<i>"Tear up the planks!</i>
<i>"Here!</i>
<i>"Here!</i>
<i>"It is the beating</i>
<i>"of his hideous heart!"</i>
(NARRATOR SOBBING)
CROW: So you presume everyone
is guilty
of some unfathomable crime?
A crime that should
remain unpunished?
DEATH: <i> I feel flattered.</i>
<i>Your obsession with death</i>
<i>is to my ears like</i>
<i>a sweet love song.</i>
What do you mean, "obsession"?
DEATH: <i> Come with me.</i>
<i>Don't delay for</i>
<i>another second.</i>
<i>Being alive in this world</i>
<i>brings you more</i>
<i>unbearable pain and suffering</i>
<i>than those who wish</i>
<i>to sleep forever</i>
<i>even as you try to extend life</i>
<i>beyond my sweet embrace.</i>
I remember vaguely,
once I wrote about a doctor.
Someone who challenged you.
NARRATOR: <i> My attention</i>
<i>for the last three years</i>
<i>had been repeatedly drawn</i>
<i>to the subject of Mesmerism.</i>
In Boston, a 13-year-old
child under hypnosis
could diagnose
his own illness,
one which his own doctors
could not determine.
And in India, a paraplegic
placed in a similar
hypnotic state
managed to take some steps.
Imagine, Mr. Valdemar,
the progress that Mesmerism
offers to science.
My friend,
I respect your enthusiasm,
but for my part,
I can't disavow
my skepticism
about the future of hypnosis.
Our table is waiting for us
at the Black Swan.
In addition,
it seems that no person
has as yet been mesmerized
in articulo mortis.
What a great testimony
will that be,
witnessing the transition
between life and death.
My friend, if you promise
to change the subject,
I'm ready to volunteer myself
to this experiment
at the time of my death.
Really?
(VALDEMAR COUGHING)
Yes, but rest assured,
I have no intention
of dying anytime soon!
(COUGHING)
NARRATOR: <i> It is now rather</i>
<i>more than seven months</i>
<i>since last time I talked</i>
<i>with Monsieur Valdemar.</i>
(COUGHS)
Phthisis has attacked
my lungs.
They give me a few months
at most.
Monsieur Valdemar,
do you remember your promise?
I beg your pardon?
Yes, the idea may seem absurd,
but think of all you have
to gain now.
No.
I don't know.
Allow me to consider it.
Valdemar, you are condemned.
You have no family or home.
What have you to lose?
Promise me
you will think about it.
Very well,
I'm in your hands.
NARRATOR: <i> It was finally</i>
<i>arranged between us</i>
<i>that he would send for me</i>
<i>about 24 hours</i>
<i>before the period</i>
<i>announced by his physicians</i>
<i>as that of his decease.</i>
<i>I received this note</i>
<i>within half an hour</i>
<i>after it was written,</i>
<i>and in 15 minutes more,</i>
<i>I was in the dying man's</i>
<i>chamber.</i>
(COUGHING)
<i>It was about five minutes</i>
<i>to eight when,</i>
<i>taking the patient's hand,</i>
<i>I begged him to state</i>
<i>as distinctly as he could</i>
<i>to Dr. L whether he</i>
<i>was entirely willing</i>
<i>that I should make the</i>
<i>experiment of mesmerizing him</i>
<i>in his then condition.</i>
Yes, I wish to be mesmerized.
I fear you have
deferred it too long.
NARRATOR: <i> At five minutes</i>
<i>before 11:00,</i>
<i>I perceived unequivocal signs</i>
<i>of the mesmeric influence.</i>
<i>When I had accomplished this,</i>
<i>it was fully midnight,</i>
<i>and I requested</i>
<i>the gentlemen present</i>
<i>to examine Monsieur Valdemar's</i>
<i>condition.</i>
<i>The patient's extremities</i>
<i>were of an icy coldness.</i>
<i>Still, the general appearance</i>
<i>was not that of death.</i>
Monsieur Valdemar,
are you asleep?
Yes,
I am asleep now.
Do not wake me.
Let me die so.
NARRATOR: <i> It was</i>
<i>now the opinion,</i>
<i>or rather the wish</i>
<i>of the physicians,</i>
<i>that Monsieur Valdemar</i>
<i>should be suffered</i>
<i>to remain undisturbed</i>
<i>in his present apparently</i>
<i>tranquil condition,</i>
<i>until death should supervene,</i>
<i>and this,</i>
<i>it was now generally agreed,</i>
<i>must take place</i>
<i>within a few minutes.</i>
<i>I concluded, however,</i>
<i>to speak to him once more.</i>
Monsieur Valdemar,
do you still sleep?
Yes.
No.
I have been sleeping
and now...
Now...
I am dead.
(SNARLING)
NARRATOR: <i> It was evident</i>
<i>that, so far,</i>
<i>death, or what is</i>
<i>usually termed death,</i>
<i>had been arrested</i>
<i>by the mesmeric process.</i>
The experiment is completed.
But are we sure he's dead?
You heard it like me, right?
Is your scientific mind
restricted
by that which you can only see
or hear yourself?
(THUNDER RUMBLES)
NARRATOR: <i> From this period</i>
<i>until the close of last week,</i>
<i>an interval</i>
<i>of nearly seven months,</i>
<i>we continued</i>
<i>to make daily calls</i>
<i>at Monsieur Valdemar's house.</i>
<i>I managed to convince</i>
<i>my colleagues</i>
<i>to leave Monsieur Valdemar</i>
<i>in this state</i>
<i>and to monitor him.</i>
<i>First, we confined ourselves</i>
<i>to simple daily observations.</i>
<i>But soon, we were obliged</i>
<i>to face the facts.</i>
Gentlemen, we are not
advancing our work.
These observations
are too superficial.
You still wish to dissect
the subject
like a laboratory animal.
Without going that far,
we can engage in some light
tests.
You are mistaken! I...
What are you suggesting,
Dr. L?
Well, we could always
let it be.
(MECHANICAL CLICKING)
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)
(ELECTRICITY SURGING)
There is nothing further
to be done.
All of the subject's vital
functions are inert.
He has stopped breathing, his
heart no longer beats, yet,
in seven months, decomposition
has not attacked his body
and no treatment
has cured his illness.
Medically, Monsieur Valdemar
is dead.
Let's wake him up.
You're talking nonsense!
These thoughts are sacrilege!
Insanity!
You would not agree
to put him in this state
and now you refuse
to release him from it!
I...
Let it go my friend,
Dr. P is right.
Monsieur Valdemar
is legally dead.
All we can do now is
to offer him a decent burial.
NARRATOR: <i> It was</i>
<i>on Friday last</i>
<i>that we finally resolved</i>
<i>to make the experiment</i>
<i>of awakening,</i>
<i>or attempting to awaken him.</i>
<i>For the purpose of relieving</i>
<i>Monsieur Valdemar</i>
<i>from the mesmeric trance,</i>
<i>I made use</i>
<i>of the customary passes.</i>
<i>These, for a time,</i>
<i>were unsuccessful.</i>
Monsieur Valdemar,
can you explain to us
what your feelings or wishes
are now?
For God's sake! Quick! Quick!
Put me to sleep!
Or waken me! Quick!
I say to you that I am dead!
Dead!
Dead!
(GASPING)
(GROANING)
NARRATOR: <i> For what</i>
<i>really occurred, however,</i>
<i>it is quite impossible</i>
<i>that any living human</i>
<i>could have been prepared.</i>
DEATH: <i> And as I can see,</i>
<i>he lost.</i>
<i>Lost to me.</i>
He was so close,
so close to sparing
Monsieur Valdemar
from your fatal embrace.
Was that a crime?
DEATH: <i> A crime against fate.</i>
<i>And your sentence was a life</i>
<i>of endless sorrow.</i>
Stop with your tortured
mind games.
DEATH: <i> There's nothing worse</i>
<i>than imagining your own death.</i>
<i>Isn't it?</i>
<i>Nothing worse than</i>
<i>to fear eternity.</i>
I wrote a story once.
A tale about someone who
relived the hell
of dying 1,000 deaths.
DEATH: <i> Perhaps a mirror where</i>
<i>you saw yourself reflected,</i>
<i>every image,</i>
<i>a different death.</i>
NARRATOR: <i> I was sick.</i>
<i>-Sick to death</i>
<i>with that long agony.</i>
-(GASPS)
<i>And when they unbound me,</i>
<i>I felt my senses</i>
<i>were leaving me.</i>
(WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY)
NARRATOR: <i> The sentence,</i>
<i>the dread sentence of death,</i>
<i>was the last of</i>
<i>distinct accentuation</i>
<i>which reached my ears.</i>
<i>After that,</i>
<i>the sound of the inquisitorial</i>
<i>voices seemed merged</i>
<i>into one dreamy,</i>
<i>indeterminate hum.</i>
(WHISPERING)
<i>I heard no more.</i>
<i>Yet, for a while,</i>
<i>I saw the lips of the judges.</i>
<i>I saw them pronouncing</i>
<i>the syllables of my name,</i>
<i>and I shuddered</i>
<i>because I heard no sound.</i>
(CHAINS CLINKING)
(SIGHS)
<i>The tall candles</i>
<i>sank into nothingness.</i>
<i>Their flames went out.</i>
<i>The blackness of darkness</i>
<i>supervened.</i>
<i>All sensations appeared</i>
<i>swallowed up</i>
<i>in a mad rushing descent,</i>
<i>as of the soul into Hades.</i>
<i>Then silence, and stillness,</i>
<i>night were the universe.</i>
<i>After this, I called to mind</i>
<i>flatness and dampness.</i>
<i>And then all the madness</i>
<i>of a memory</i>
<i>which busies itself</i>
<i>among forbidden things.</i>
<i>So far, I had not</i>
<i>opened my eyes.</i>
<i>I dreaded the first glance</i>
<i>at the objects around me.</i>
<i>My worst thoughts, then,</i>
<i>were confirmed.</i>
<i>The blackness of eternal night</i>
<i>encompassed me.</i>
(SQUEAKING)
<i>I struggled for breath.</i>
<i>The atmosphere</i>
<i>was intolerably close.</i>
<i>But where</i>
<i>and in what state was I?</i>
<i>The condemned to death,</i>
<i>I knew,</i>
<i>perished usually</i>
<i>at the autos-da-fe,</i>
<i>and one of these had been held</i>
<i>on the very night</i>
<i>of the day of my trial.</i>
<i>Had I been remanded</i>
<i>to my dungeon</i>
<i>to await the next sacrifice,</i>
<i>which would not take</i>
<i>place for many months?</i>
(GASPS)
(COUGHING)
NARRATOR: <i> And now,</i>
<i>there came thronging</i>
<i>upon my recollection</i>
<i>1,000 vague rumors</i>
<i>of the horrors of Toledo.</i>
<i>Of the dungeons,</i>
<i>there had been</i>
<i>strange things narrated.</i>
<i>Strange, and too ghastly</i>
<i>to repeat.</i>
<i>Was I left to perish</i>
<i>of starvation</i>
<i>in this subterranean</i>
<i>world of darkness,</i>
<i>or what fate,</i>
<i>perhaps even more fearful,</i>
<i>awaited me?</i>
<i>My outstretched hands,</i>
<i>at length,</i>
<i>encountered some solid</i>
<i>obstruction.</i>
<i>It was a wall.</i>
<i>I followed it up.</i>
<i>This process, however,</i>
<i>afforded me no means</i>
<i>of ascertaining the dimensions</i>
<i>of my dungeon.</i>
<i>Another step before my fall,</i>
<i>and the world had seen me</i>
<i>no more.</i>
<i>And the death just avoided</i>
<i>was of the very character</i>
<i>which I had regarded</i>
<i>as fabulous and frivolous</i>
<i>in the tales regarding</i>
<i>the Inquisition.</i>
<i>To the victims of its tyranny,</i>
<i>there was the choice of death</i>
<i>with its direst physical</i>
<i>agonies,</i>
<i>or death with its most hideous</i>
<i>moral horrors.</i>
<i>I had been reserved</i>
<i>for the latter.</i>
<i>I was consumed</i>
<i>with intolerable thirst.</i>
<i>This thirst appeared to be</i>
<i>the design of my persecutors</i>
<i>to stimulate,</i>
<i>for the food in the dish</i>
<i>was meat,</i>
<i>pungently seasoned.</i>
<i>It must have been drugged,</i>
<i>for scarcely had I drunk,</i>
<i>before I became irresistibly</i>
<i>drowsy.</i>
(GASPING)
<i>I could no longer doubt</i>
<i>the doom prepared for me</i>
<i>by monkish ingenuity</i>
<i>in torture.</i>
<i>My cognizance of the pit</i>
<i>had become known</i>
<i>to the inquisitorial.</i>
<i>Having failed to fall,</i>
<i>it was no part</i>
<i>of the demon plan</i>
<i>to hurl me into the abyss,</i>
<i>and thus a different and</i>
<i>milder destruction awaited me.</i>
(STRAINING)
(THUD ECHOING)
(MACHINERY RATTLING)
(GROANING)
<i>I counted the rushing</i>
<i>vibrations of the steel.</i>
<i>Inch by inch.</i>
<i>Line by line.</i>
<i>With a descent</i>
<i>only appreciable at intervals</i>
<i>that seemed ages.</i>
(GROANING)
<i>Down, steadily down, it crept.</i>
<i>Down.</i>
<i>Certainly, relentlessly down.</i>
<i>It vibrated within three</i>
<i>inches of my bosom.</i>
<i>I prayed for its more speedy</i>
<i>descent.</i>
<i>I grew frantically mad,</i>
<i>and struggled</i>
<i>to force myself upward</i>
<i>against the sweep</i>
<i>of the fearful scimitar.</i>
(GASPS)
(PANTING)
<i>For the moment, at least,</i>
<i>I was free.</i>
<i>Free! And in the grasp</i>
<i>of the Inquisition.</i>
<i>Free!</i>
<i>I had but escaped death</i>
<i>in one form of agony,</i>
<i>to be delivered unto worse</i>
<i>than death in some other.</i>
<i>For a wild moment,</i>
<i>did my spirit refuse</i>
<i>to comprehend the meaning</i>
<i>of what I saw.</i>
<i>Any horror but this!</i>
<i>Any death but that of the pit.</i>
<i>Might I have not known</i>
<i>that into the pit</i>
<i>it was the object of the</i>
<i>burning iron to urge me?</i>
<i>Could I resist its glow?</i>
(SCREAMING)
<i>There was a discordant hum</i>
<i>of human voices.</i>
<i>There was a loud blast.</i>
<i>The French army</i>
<i>had entered Toledo.</i>
<i>The Inquisition was in</i>
<i>the hands of its enemies.</i>
DEATH: <i> You have devoted</i>
<i>so many pages to my name,</i>
<i>caressing my face</i>
<i>with your poems,</i>
<i>kissing my lips</i>
<i>with your prose.</i>
<i>All veiled love letters</i>
<i>addressed to me.</i>
<i>You fear me</i>
<i>and yet, you are insatiably</i>
<i>attracted.</i>
<i>Come with me. It's time.</i>
No, it cannot be.
I don't want to be forgotten.
I was buried
in a common grave.
My writings were
forgotten for years.
DEATH: <i> You are already dead.</i>
<i>How could you remember</i>
<i>your own death</i>
<i>unless you have succumbed</i>
<i>to my embrace?</i>
(CAWING)
DEATH: <i> Your life is not</i>
<i>worth living anymore.</i>
<i>It is time to meet</i>
<i>your own ghosts,</i>
<i>the people you loved</i>
<i>and lost forever.</i>
<i>Come now, Poe.</i>
<i>You love me.</i>
<i>You've been a corpse</i>
<i>walking amongst the living</i>
<i>for a long time, Edgar.</i>
<i>It must have been quite</i>
<i>a strain.</i>
Maybe you're right.
Sometimes I think the only
thing that kept me from you
was my beating heart.
DEATH: <i> Look at your final act.</i>
<i>They all succumb</i>
<i>to my prowess.</i>
<i>The poor, the weak,</i>
<i>the rich, the powerful.</i>
<i>Everybody bows before me.</i>
<i>I offer you one last chance.</i>

I don't want my work

My work is eternal.
I want that eternity.
I want to be sure
my words will survive me,
that they will never be lost
in time.
DEATH: <i> That, my friend,</i>
<i>nevermore.</i>
