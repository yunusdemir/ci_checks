There has been a war
between orcs and humans
for as long as can be remembered.
But mere was once a
time when we did
not even know who our enemy was.
Or what that evil green magic,
the Fei, had done to us.
Bu! in the beginning,
how could we have known?
What choice did we have?
Our world was dying
and I had to find
my clan a new home.
Durotan.
I can feel your eyes.
I thought you were asleep.
Was.
Dreaming of a hunt
through the snow.
I've thought of a name.
Well, keep it to yourself, wife.
I'll choose a name
when I meet him.
Or her.
Oh...
And how will the great
Durotan name his son
if I do not travel with him?
A son?
Can you hide your fat belly?
Better than you can
hide your fat head.
So many clans in
one place, Orgrim.
Laughing Skull, Blackrock.
All have been summoned.
It will be a mighty warband.
Just wonder who's left to fight.
Victory or death!
Blackrock, over there.
How much longer, Blackhand?
We are ready, Gul'Dan.
What did she say?
She begs for you
to free her child.
But I need him.
I need all of them.
Move, half-breed!
What is that?
Gul'Dan's magic.
The fuel for my magic is life.
We only have enough
prisoners to send through
our strongest warriors.
But that will be enough.
The enemy is weak.
When we arrive, we will
take them as fuel!
We will build a new portal!
And when it is complete,
we will bring through
all of the Horde!
Let me go first.
For the Horde!
With child?
You dare bring that
wachook into my warband?
Let me go, Blackhand!
Draka!
Push, little one. Push!
A new warrior for the Horde.
Lothar.
Come. I've got
something for you.
What is it?
A mechanical marvel.
It's a boomstick.
Odd.
Take water.
You might want to
head home, big man.
Someone's attacked
one of your garrisons.
Seems your king
needs you' Commander.
An entire garrison,
and no one saw anything?
We did find someone.
He was searching the bodies
here in the barracks.
In the barracks?
Finally!
Are you in command?
That's
the mark of the Kirin Tor.
What are you doing in
my city, spellchucker?
Let me complete my examination
of the body across the hall.
Now, why would I do that?
Within that body is the
secret to your attacks.
What was that?
You must summon the Guardian.
Medivh?
It should be he who explains it.
Only the King
summons the Guardian.
Get him to Goldshire.
What kind of beasts?
Rumors, Your Majesty.
How does a garrison of 30 men
disappear without a whisper?
The Fel.
Or at least its influence.
Is this him?
Mmm-hmm.
Your Majesty.
Dad.
Thank you, Sergeant.
So, who are you, Mage?
My name is Khadgar.
Lam the Guardian novitiate.
I was.
I renounced my vows.
You mean, your a fugitive?
I'm not hiding.
Your Majesty...
I may have left my
training, but I
didn't leave my
abilities behind.
I've sensed something.
Dark forces, when it's strong,
it almost has a smell.
Knowing that something
so evil was
so close, I couldn't
just ignore it.
- Where has this happened?
- Is this true?
What's going on out there?
Smoke, sir.
Southeast.
Your Majesty, I
urge you to engage
the Guardian with all haste.
They've reached Elwynn Forest.
Grand Hamlet is burning.
An attack?
What?
Stop requesting Callao.
Stay out of my business.
He wants to follow in
his father's footsteps.
My son doesn't need your help.
Tread carefully.
You talk to your queen.
You are my sister first.
When was your last
visit to Karazhan?
With you. I don't know...
Six years.
And you've had no contact
with Medivh since?
Not for lack of trying.
Well, he can't hide from us now.
The Guardian is summoned.
Get on.
Good luck.
Okay!
We need them alive!
My baby!
This is not for a warrior.
Lei me go!
Frostwolves do
not join the hunt?
We prefer our enemies armed
with an axe, not a child.
We have been commanded, Durotan.
Respect the old ways.
There must be a worthy foe
somewhere on this dung heap.
Find them all!
Try not to kill too many,
we need them alive.
Lamar.
Moroes.
Look at you.
You haven't aged a bit.
Where is everyone?
Many things have changed.
The power that must
be locked away here.
The knowledge.
Where is he?
I didn't know so
many books even existed.
Wait here.
And try not to touch anything.
He sees no one?
World's been at peace.
Good you are here, Lothar.
It will do the Guardian
a world of good
to see a friendly face
beyond this old mug.
He can't refuse you.
Nor King Llane.
Not if he's summoned.
Chop-Chili?-
Did you summon him, Moroes'?
No. He did not.
Son.
You've become a sculptor?
I'm making a golem.
Usually takes
years for the magic
to seep into the clay,
but up here
it's much faster.
Make someone to
keep Moroes company.
Help to clean up
around the house.
Thank you.
It's good to see you, Lothar.
We need your guidance, Medivh.
Our king summons you.
Who's the boy downstairs?
Hello?
Guardian?
Have a good look around?
Get some ideas what
your going to do
with the place once it's yours?
Guardian, I renounced my vow.
I didn't want to come here.
I swear, Guardian!
I urged them to find you.
I told them.
You should be
the one to explain.
Explain what?
Fen
In Azeroth?
In the barracks.
One the bodies.
Guardian, what is the Fel?
A magic unlike any other.
It feeds on life itself.
It pollutes the user, twisting
everything it touches.
It promises great power, but
it exacts a terrible price.
There is no place
for the Fel in Azeroth.
You've done the right thing.
We'll go.
Hey! Go home, you.
Step in.
Medivh.
Your Grace.
It has been too long.
Come.
Help us get to the root of
these troubles of ours.
What kind of beasts?
They're saying giants.
Armed giants,
wolves to carry them.
Huge unstoppable monsters.
What of the other kingdoms?
Are they suffering the same?
All seek our protection, yet
none trust us enough
to tell us anything.
We know nothing about
these so-called monsters.
We need prisoners.
Even a corpse would
tell us something.
I don't know what
danger we're in, Medivh.
I exist to protect
this realm, my lord.
It is my very purpose.
I am the Guardian.
At least for
the time being, anyhow.
Yes.
What are we gonna do about...
What is his name?
Khadgar, sire.
He'll be coming with us.
Well, then.
We better get going.
Halt.
It can't be.
Guardian?
Close ranks!
Watch your back!
Watch your flank!
To your left!
Watch your flanks!
Watch your flank!
To your left!
Guardian!
Die, you beast!
Don't try and take them
on with brute force.
They're stronger.
Be smarter.
The Fel.
They're all dying!
Only the green ones.
Kill that big bastard.
Durotan. Move.
Guardian.
Guardian, what did you do?
I was right, wasn't I?
It's here!
Where are you going?
Get these men
safely back to Stormwind.
I have to return to Karazhan.
You did well today.
Where's the Guardian?
Karazhan.
We need a prisoner.
Where's your horse?
They took my horse.
Really? Just stay there.
No!
How much do you
love your master?
I'll do it!
Back off!
Pity.
He would have made a good coat.
Over here!
You took it alone?
Yes.
Looks like
the runt of the litter.
You.
What are you? And why do
you attack our lands?
He does not know what you speak.
You speak our language?
And I will wear your tongue!
I will not warn you again!
Tell him to stop.
You tell him.
Your welcome.
Have you a name?
You understand our language.
Again.
Have you a name?
Gamma.
She calls herself Garona.
What kind of being are you?
She seems more like us
than those beasts we fought.
Om.
Orc?
That's what you are, or the
beast in the cage was?
I know every race in
the Seven Kingdoms.
I've never heard of "orcâ€œ.
Show me where you come from?
This is not Orc world.
Orc world is dead.
Orcs take this world now.
Not from this world?
How did you get here?
The Great Gate.
Deep in ground... Into
magic brought us here.
But how did you
learn our language?
Orc take prisoner for the gate.
I learn from them.
Prisoners?
Our people?
Are they alive?
Yes. Many.
Why?
To feed the gate.
To bring in the Horde.
To take your world.
You'll take us to them.
No.
You'll take us to them.
Or you'll end up like
your friend in the cage.
You think your fearsome?
Orc children have pets
more fearsome than you.
We're not trying to
be fearsome, Garona.
We're trying to protect
our people, our families.
If you help us,
I give you my oath,
you will have your freedom.
Fearsome Backhand,
Warchief of the Horde.
You have allowed the small-teeth
to kill your warriors.
Worse, you've shamed your people
by running from an enemy.
Are you too weak
to talk, Destroyer?
The Horde has no
use for weakness.
Respect our tradition, Warchief.
You know the penalty.
Death!
For the Horde!
For the Horde!
For the Horde!
For the Horde!
Stop!
You dare interrupt
this judgment?
We fought hard.
Their warlock used
your Fel against us.
Only I can control the Fel!
I see you and your
men have survived.
Perhaps Blackhand
kept you safely away
from the battlefield?
Maybe he knows your weak, too.
Do you wish to challenge
me, little chieftain?
I do not question, Gul'Dan.
But the Fel is born of death.
It must have a price.
A price paid in lives taken.
Will you hold your son?
He will be a great chieftain.
Like his father.
A born leader.
I was no leader today.
He challenges you already.
If Gul'Dan can infect
one as innocent as him,
what chance do
the rest of us have?
Whatever happens.
Whatever happens.
I see you.
This gate,
who showed it to Gul'Dan?
Who led him to Azeroth?
Gul'Dan called him a demon.
Did you see it?
Not the face,
but the voice.
Like fire and ash.
I'll be here if you need me.
Your mate.
I could kill you
before he even reaches me.
Lamar'?
He is my brother.
The king is my mate.
Your the chieftain's wife then.
I suppose so.
Then killing you would bring
me even greater honor.
Not among my kind.
It is a cold night.
I thought you might use these.
It will warm you.
More of our villages
burn tonight.
One of them is the
village of my birth.
I cannot imagine what horrors
you have been through, Garona.
But this doesn't need to happen.
We have had peace in these
lands for many years now.
Peace between races
from all over the world.
What is...
I can have it removed.
There is a life
here for you, Garona.
With us.
A life of freedom.
If you want it.
The Great Gate.
"From light comes darkness
"and from darkness light."
Well, that's clear.
"Ask Alodi."
Alodi.
It's good to see trees again.
And the snow.
Even from a distance.
Remember when we
would track blood
ox through the Frostwind Dunes?
There was always meat,
always life.
You don't think it's strange
that we lost our home
when Gul'Dan came to power?
One Orc cannot
kill a world, Durotan.
Are you sure?
Look around you.
Does it not remind
you of something?
Wherever Gul'Dan works his
magic, the land dies.
If our people are to make
a home here, my friend...
Gul'Dan must be stopped.
We are not powerful enough
to defeat Gul'Dan.
No.
No.
But with the humans' help,
we could be.
I want that weapon.
You'll have me to protect you.
I need no one to protect me!
What are you looking at?
Bookworm.
Take the first watch.
Respectfully, Commander,
my name is Khadgar.
My deepest apologies, Khadgar.
You see, I thought we bonded
when I didn't put you in a prison cell
for breaking into the Royal Barracks.
Now take the watch.
Well, at least your not reading.
He wishes to lie with me.
Beg your pardon?
You would be injured.
I don't want to lie with you.
Good. You would not
be an effective mate.
Why do you laugh?
I can't see how you humans
survive such a thing.
No muscles to protect you.
Brittle bones that break.
You don't look
that different to us.
How did you survive?
Broken bones heal stronger.
Mine are very strong.
I'm sorry.
Do not be.
My name...
Gamma.
It means "cursed" in Orc.
My mother was burned alive
for giving birth to me.
They kept you alive, though.
Gul'Dan did.
He gave me her tusk.
To remember her.
My parents gave me to the Kirin
Tor when I was six years old.
That's the last time I saw them.
Or any of my
brothers and sisters.
It brings a family honor
to offer a child
to the Kirin Tor.
To have their son taken up to
the floating city of Dalaran
and be trained by the most
powerful Mages in the land.
Less so, to have them run away.
Well, that was cheerful.
The Great Gate.
Why do they need
so many prisoners?
Like wood for a fire.
Green magic takes
life to open the gate.
How many more orcs are
they planning on bringing?
All of them.
This is just a warband.
When the portal is opened,
Gul'Dan will bring the Horde.
Get them back to Stormwind.
We'll ride ahead.
Garona.
We should go. It's not safe...
To the north, there is a black
rock that touches the sky.
I would meet with their leader.
To challenge him?
I saw you lead the small-teeth
to our encampment.
They have seen
what is being built.
But only you know what Gul'Dan
has planned for my people.
This magic is death,
to all things.
Must be stopped.
Tell him.
The black rock,
when the sun is highest.
I will.
Chieftain.
If I return,
would you take me
into your clan?
Your safer here.
With them.
Is it as you feared?
The Fel is everywhere.
Then you mustn't leave again.
They need a Guardian's help
now more than ever.
Maybe the boy can help.
We need solutions!
Easy for you to say that!
The Dwarven forges
must work overtime.
You treat us
no better than dogs.
We shall supply you no more!
Enough!
You have all called on
Stormwind in the past.
Either for troops
or arbitration.
If we do not unite
to fight this enemy,
we will perish.
Hear, hear.
Stormwind needs
soldiers, arms, horses.
We have our own
kingdoms to look after.
- Fight your own wars!
- Your Majesty.
Commander.
The orcs are building a portal,
through which they
plan to bring an army.
If we do not stop
them now, we may
never get another opportunity.
Where is he?
Where is the protector
of Azeroth?
Where is the Guardian?
Where is Medivh?
MY liege.
I suggest we take a recess.
Take as long as you like.
We're done.
Commander.
Whats left of the Fourth has
retreated from Stonewatch.
What's left?
Callao is among the injured.
Dad?
I'm fine. It's fine.
You had me worried.
Where's the rest of your troop?
They took most of them alive.
We'll get them back.
Don't be in such a hurry.
Your all I have.
I know.
I'm a soldier.
He would not ask
for this meeting
if he thought he could
defeat Gul'Dan alone.
The Fel must truly terrify him.
Durotan is scared of nothing.
The location.
The suddenness of this meeting.
Sounds like a trap.
It is not.
Could be.
It is not!
Could be.
It is not!
What do you think?
It's too good
an opportunity to ignore.
I think we have no choice.
We must stop the orcs
from opening the portal.
But we will need help.
And if he's lying?
Orcs do not lie.
What if he is?
There is no honor in it.
And where is the honor
in him betraying his own people?
Duroian is protecting his clan.
His enemy is the Fel.
Gul'Dan is the betrayer.
This ore, Duvman...
How do you know him?
He freed me.
And he is loved by his clan.
He is a strong Chieftain.
Strong chiefs must earn
their clan's trust.
If we are to
expect you to join us,
we must earn yours.
To defend yourself.
With this?
Yes.
Find the Guardian.
What is this?
Guardian?
The gate. We saw it,
in the Morass.
I've been putting together all
the clues I can about it.
This.
This drawing.
Where did you copy it from?
Guardian.
And this.
And this.
And this?
I've been researching ever since
I felt the presence of the Fel.
I am the Guardian! Me.
Not you. Not yet.
I just thought you might
appreciate some help.
Don't presume you can help me.
You have no idea the forces
I contend with.
If you want to help,
protect the king.
You leave the Fel to me.
Interesting choice.
Guardian.
Pack up
and move to the west gate!
You there! Rise from your
stall and get moving. Now!
I need your help.
I found a book.
Of course you did.
There was an illustration
that showed a gate
like the one we saw being built.
Sorry. Sorry.
Khadgar.
So then I tried to show the
Guardian, but he became furious.
Burned all my research.
He would've burned this, too, if
it hadn't been
hidden in my robe.
No, turn the page. Here.
Look.
See?
What do you think
the image means?
The orcs were summoned.
From this side of the gate.
They were invited in.
And the Guardian
burned your research?
He's probably just
trying to protect you.
Now go away.
A good spot for an ambush.
Our sentries are well placed.
I will check again.
Lam King Llane.
I'm told you wish to talk.
Ask him if they plan to
return to their home.
({IN ENGLISH)
Our world is destroyed.
There is nothing to go back to.
We are not responsible
for destroying your world.
War with us will solve nothing.
He says, for
orcs, war solves everything.
Then why is he here?
To save my people.
The Fel takes life
from more than its victims.
It kills the earth and
corrupts those who use it.
Gul'Dan would poison everything
with his death magic.
If my people are to survive,
Gul'Dan must be destroyed!
In two suns,
the humans we have captured
will be used to fuel the portal.
If you attack our camp
and draw his warriors away,
Frostwolf clan will kill him.
Two days.
If we do this,
you will protect my
people until then?
I will try.
Ambush!
It's a trap!
Traitor, die!
Retreat!
Back!
Protect our camp!
Fall back!
At the rim!
Protect the king!
Stay together!
Focus, man. Like old times.
Stand your ground!
Spread out!
Swords!
Look out!
Fall back!
You all right?
Your no good to us dead.
Go! I'll get the others.
Fall back!
We're all getting out.
Medivh will cover our retreat.
Spread out!
Protect the rear!
Watch out!
Garona!
Stay together!
Fall back!
Cover your ground!
Where's the bloody Guardian?
At the rear!
Protect the king.
I got them.
Shield formation!
Kill the beast!
Retreat to the plateau!
Fall back!
Medivh.
Medivh! Take it down!
Medivh!
Hold on, son.
Dad.
For Azeroth.
Medivh!
Callao.
He's here.
What's wrong with him?
We need to get him to Karazhan.
I'll get the horses.
You won't make it
in time by road.
Take one of my birds.
Place him in the font.
Moroes, what's wrong with him?
I told him not
to leave Karazhan.
I have to go.
We need the help of
the Kirin Tor. Now!
Go.
There are medicines
I must prepare.
Sit with him.
You and the baby must leave now!
You are a traitor, Durotan.
No.
One who values
what we once were.
Like you used to.
That time has passed.
We are but fuel for the Fel now.
There is still hope, Blackhand.
Our children.
Do not make me take
more innocent lives,
young chieftain.
If I submit...
Would you let my people be?
What will I call our son?
Go'el.
You.
Where's the old man?
He told me to watch you.
The king?
He is alive.
Lothaï¬‚s son is dead.
I argued for the meeting.
Lothar will hate me.
This upsets you?
He is a great warrior.
He defends his people well.
A good mam
10: an an;.
I am no Orc.
I am no human either.
When I was younger, I used
to feel apart from my kin.
I traveled far and wide,
looking for
wisdom.
Feel a connection
with all the souls
I was charged with protecting.
In my travels, I meta
strong and noble people.
Among them, a female.
Who accepted me for who I was.
Who loved me.
It was not a life I was fated to
have, but it taught
me something.
If love is what you need,
you must be willing to travel to
the ends of the
world to find it.
You left your mate.
Go find Lothar.
Step inside the circle.
This
is my gift to you, Garona.
Whole world in
exchange for a statue.
Gods are strange creatures.
Frostwolves.
You are a practical people.
Those of us from the south have
always admired that about you.
When the portal opens
and the rest of
the Hordejoin us,
we will gift them the Fel.
All of them.
Durotan did not agree to this!
And why would you care
what that traitor thinks?
It is time for a new leader
of the Frostwolf clan.
One who has the best interests
of his orcs in mind.
One who appreciates
Gul'Dan's vision.
His power.
Come...
I will grant you the Fel.
Durotan,
he has poisoned the
Frostwolves against Fel.
Let me gather them.
Bring them here.
Grant me the Fel
in front of them.
Let them see how
much stronger I become.
As I said, a practical people.
This is a new dawn.
The time of the Horde.
Be feared
or be fuel.
I'm sorry.
Callan's mother
died in childbirth.
I blamed him for it
for years.
I'm not gonna blame you.
He was so young.
In my entire life,
I've never felt as
much pain as I do now.
No...
No!
Move out!
Move!
Gul'Dan does not want to waste
his power on the Frostwolves.
Burn them!
Take the weak, kill the strong!
Get them!
I'll bathe in your blood!
Maybe.
But not now.
I can't give you long,
but I can give you a head start.
For the sake of your son, Draka.
Leave.
Now.
Kill them all!
Burn it down!
You should have
trusted in your Chieftain,
Orgrim Doomhammer.
She's getting away!
Wait for me.
Khadgar!
How dare you return here!
Get out!
I come seeking your wisdom.
There is nothing
for you here now.
The Guardian Medivh is unwell.
What?
He has been poisoned by the Fel.
What? Ridiculous!
What do you know
of the Dark Portal?
You come back and
accuse the Guardianâ€œ.
What is Alodi?
How does he know?
Alodi.
What is it?
An entity from a time before
the Kirin Tor existed.
We think it sewed a function
similar to that of the Guardian.
Protector.
No one beyond the Arch Council
knows of its existence And
it will stay that way.
For you to mention it in the
same breath as the Dark Portal
is too much
to be mere.â€œ
Coincidence.
Do I go in?
I don't know. It's never
done that before.
Khadgar... I know you.
From the library.
Your Alodi?
I used the last of my
energies to summon you here.
The Guardian has betrayed us.
Medivh.
I saw the Fel in his eyes.
He is consumed by it.
If he is not stopped,
this world will burn.
I don't have the power
to defeat a Guardian.
Guardian is but a name.
The true guardians of this world
are the people themselves.
I know you see what
the Kirin Tor cannot.
It's why you left them.
No one can stand against
the darkness alone.
I don't understand
what you want me to do.
Yes, you do.
Trust in your friends.
Together you can
save this world.
Always remember, from
light comes darkness
and from darkness.â€œ
Light.
Up, up..
Thank you, Mamas.
You'll recover, Guardian.
You always do.
No.
Thank you.
For everything you've done.
I'm sorry, old friend.
Seems that I have let
the arcs into this world.
The Fel, it has twisted me.
I don't even know what
else I may have done.
I just don't remember.
Everything I've thought
to protect, I have...
Destroyed.
I can't control the Fel.
No one can.
Five legions
to block Deadwind Pass.
Another ten here, here, and here,
along Redridge Mountains.
Supply lines here.
While the Eastern Sea hems
them in both south and east.
If we hold these positions,
we will be at our strongest.
Containment.
Until there is a better option, yes.
And when there's
10 times as many?
What then?
If there were easy answers...
Our priority must be to
stop the gate from opening.
Fail there, and it's
just a matter of time
before they beat us
with sheer numbers.
What do you suggest?
Send everything we've got.
Destroy the gate,
free our people
and end the immediate threat.
And the orcs that remain?
We'll take care of them later.
After they've ravaged
the entire kingdom.
My lords.
Medium, you are up and well.
I am.
I feel...
Restored.
We need you.
We've been agonizing
over our options.
Some of us believe
there are no options.
We need fresh eyes.
I have news.
I met with Durotan.
You met with Durotan?
The rebellion against Gul'Dan
is gaining strength.
With their help, we can
destroy this gate.
That doesn't change my plan.
What plan?
Anduin believes we should
attack with full force.
I'm concerned it leaves the rest
of the kingdom defenseless.
How many legions would you need
to hold the ores in place?
Five for Deadwind Pass.
10 for the Redridge Mountains,
10 more to protect the city.
We've already lost 18 legions.
That leaves one, two, three.
Can it be done, Medivh?
No, it can't be done.
With three legions,
Frostwolves and my power...
With all due respect,
Guardian your powers
have proven unreliable
at best, recently.
Llane, have I ever let you down?
Let him down?
Where have you even been
for the last six years?
Please, Anduin...
Medivh is the Guardian.
Not the one you remember.
He's lost!
He's unstable!
And he won't be there
when you really need him.
Find your bearings, Anduin.
I would march into Hell for you
if I thought there was the
slightest chance of victory.
But there isn't.
This is suicide.
Is this about Callao?
It was a tragedy.
If he hadn't been trying so
hard to win your approval
he might still be with us today.
Medivh.
Callao wasn't ready,
you knew it.
And you let him
play soldier anyway.
Anduin, stop! No!
You killed him!
Just save it!
Commander, please, sir!
Please!
Varis.
Take him to a cell to calm down.
You are no use to us like this.
We'll protect
the kingdom, my lord.
You and I.
Why are you here?
The King.
He goes to fight the Horde.
With your Guardian's help
Durotan will kill Gul'Dan.
Don't trust him.
I have told you,
orcs do not lie.
Not Durotan.
Don't trust Medivh.
I will try to protect your king.
Don't go with them.
Why?
I don't want you to get hurt.
Come back alive.
- Free us.
- We're thirsty!
Spare us! Spare us!
Please!
We need your help!
Hey! Frostwolf!
Now, your
enemies with all sides.
I'll tell them it was you.
What happened?
I'm sorry, Durotan.
I did not see how we could
side with the humans,
against our own kind.
I was wrong.
Gul'Dan's Fel
magic is destroying us.
Where's Draka?
Safe.
But the rest...
They wouldn't follow him if they
could see what he has become.
Then I'll show them.
There is no other
man I would entrust
the safety of my
family to, Varian.
Keep them safe while I'm gone.
Ready?
I would feel better if
Lothar were riding with us.
We'll be fine.
I will return to Karazhan,
get ready for battle.
Find me at the portal.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Psst.
Guard!
I know your just doing your job.
And a good one at that.
But I've cooled down now.
So, if you'd just come
and open this gate...
So I can protect the King.
Open the gates!
I am just following my...
Where the hell have you been?
The Kirin Tor.
It only works on
the simple-minded.
Lasts about a minute.
Your armor, Commander.
Sorry.
They have a full
day ahead of us.
I just hope we're not too late.
We can't go after them.
Not if you want to save Azeroth.
My King needs me!
Azeroth needs you more!
If you want to save your King,
we need to stop Medivh first.
Where is Medivh?
We've got a demon to kill.
Can't be far.
Search over there.
I need that baby.
Check everywhere!
Search on the road!
Remember,
you are the son of
Durotan and Draka,
an unbroken line of chieftains.
Search by the river.
I am Durotan.
Son of Garad.
Chieftain of the Frostwolf clan.
And I am hereto kill Gul'Dan.
A ghost cannot invoke mak'gora.
You are the chieftain
of no clan.
Your people are food for worms.
Some of us still live, Warchief.
Shall I make
a quick end of them?
I always thought you were one
for tradition, Blackhand.
DU FOILSH.
Your clan was weak
and you are a traitor.
I accept your challenge
if only to personally rip the
heart out of your pathetic body.
What of the portal?
You must be ready when
the incantation begins.
This won't take long.
Crush him, Gul'Dan!
It's the incantation
to the Orc home world.
He's opening the portal.
We need to shut him up.
The incantation...
I have no time for this.
Blackhand!
This is a mak'gora.
You will respect our tradition.
Keep fighting-
Gul'Dan cheats!
That's cheating!
Shame an yum.!
You cheat, Gul'Dan!
This is not our way!
â€œmum.!
Gul'Dan!
You have no honor.
You will follow this thing?
Will you?
You will follow this demon?
We will not!
I will not.
Demon!
He does not even look Orc now!
I follow a true Orc!
A chieftain.
May your bones rot, demon!
Anyone else?
And you, Warchief.
You will take the Fel
and you will become stronger
than any Orc has ever been.
And when the Fel has remade you,
you will crush
the small-teeth.
Now claim my new world.
Frostwolves.
We are on our own now.
We few, then.
Get to the prisoners.
We will free our people!
Charge!
Get to it, men!
Move!
Attack!
Ideas?
Very impressive.
Now try shutting him up.
Well, that went well.
It's moving! Do something!
Fine.
I'll handle this.
You take care of Medivh.
Hey, over here!
Clay face!
Now, men!
Fire!
At the rear!
Come, my ores.
Let the Fel unleash the
full power of the Horde!
For Gul'Dan!
For the Horde!
Hey! Kid, wake up!
You all right?
Quick thinking.
Slicing its head off like that.
Yeah.
Just how I planned it.
What now?
The Guardian has to speak
the incantation himself.
As long as he's doing that,
we can get in close.
Distract him.
Then what?
Get Medivh in the font.
Is that all?
Medivh.
If there is something of you
still in there, old friend,
come back to us.
Medivh.
Come on.
Kill me.
I've got nothing
left to live for now anyway.
After all, life is just
fuel to you, isn't it?
But Llane, he believed in you.
Don't kill your king.
Don't kill your friend.
Whatever you plan to do, kid,
do it now!
Now.
Now! Now!
Now, kid!
The portal, it's closing!
Then do it now!
No.
Your stronger than he is.
From light comes darkness,
and from darkness,
light.
Show me your eyes.
I have to go.
I'm proud of you.
Stormwind.
My mun Through
me perm, Stormwind!
Thank you, Guardian.
Vans.
Legion, forward!
Attack!
Garona, ride with me.
Run!
Varis, set the men
in a perimeter.
Garona, Karos, lake what men we
can spare and free
the prisoners.
And send them
through to Stormwind.
Form a line, shield to shield!
We will hold as long as we can.
Get to the portal!
Go!
Mercy! Thank you!
Stormwind.
Need more powder!
Help me push!
Come on, boys!
Put some spunk into it!
Go around! We'll attack
them from behind the portal!
Watch your flank!
Take care of him.
We should leave!
We save as many of
our people as we can!
It's the loneliness.
It makes us weak.
Khadgar.
I'm sorry.
I wanted to save us all.
I always did.
No!
It's closed!
We've lost the Guardian.
No, no, no!
Biackhand comes to claim
the honor of killing you.
Gamma.
No good will come
from us both dying.
Look around you.
We're surrounded.
Your killing me is the only
hope we have for peace.
You told Lady Taria that killing
her would bring you honor.
Well, killing me
will make you a hero.
Survive.
Bring peace between
orcs and humans.
You must.
You must.
No! My lord!
She has killed
their chieftain, Gul'Dan.
The Horde embraces you.
Om.
Huh?
Malfigora.
For my son.
Kill him.
Kill him!
Gul'Dan!
The mak'gora is sacred.
The human won. Fairly.
Let your warriors
honor their tradition.
I will not be disobeyed!
What are you waiting for?
Do as I say!
Traitors!
Ma: mums
Get out of my way.
I'll do it myself!
Who will obey you?
If you go to war
with your own kind...
If you do this,
you will lose the Horde.
And this war is only beginning.
For you! sun.
So your spirit can teach him.
Garonz-rs dagger.
I pulled that from Llane's neck.
Well, there has lo
be an explanation.
Yes.
She made her choice.
I don't believe that
Maybe you and I didn't know her
as well as we thought we did.
There is no greater
blessing a city can have
than a king
who would sacrifice
himself for his people.
But such a sacrifice
must be earned.
We must deserve it.
If we only show our unity
to mourn a good man's death,
was King Llane
wrong to believe in you?
No!
We will avenge him, my lady!
Lead us
against the orcs, Lothar!
For Azeroth!
For Azeroth and the Alliance!
For Azeroth!
For the Alliance!
You will
travel far, my lime GdeL.
My world may be lost,
but this is your world now.
Take what you need from it.
Make a home for the orcs and
let no one stand in your way.
My lord, you should see this.
You are the son of
Durotan and Drake,
an unbroken line of chieftains.
And our people need a leader
now more than ever.
