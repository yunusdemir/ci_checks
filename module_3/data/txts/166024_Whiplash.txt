I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
No. Stay.
What's your name?
Andrew Neiman, sir.
What year are you?
I'm first year.
-Do you know who I am?
-Yes, sir.
So you know I'm
looking for players.
Yes, sir.
Then why did you stop playing?
Did I ask you to
start playing again?
-Sorry, I...
-I asked why you stopped playing,
and your version of an answer was
to turn into a wind-up monkey.
-Sorry, I thought...
-Show me your rudiments.
Yes, sir.
Double-time swing.
No, double-time. Double it.
Faster. Faster!
Oopsy-daisy.
Forgot my jacket.
-No Swedish Fish?
-No, not today.
Thanks. Mm-hm.
-You okay? Hm?
-Yeah.
Yeah. Well, I don't know.
He saw me play today.
And?
Mm.
Well, you got plenty
of options still.
-What does that mean?
-Just...
-Other options?
-Just, you know...
It's just life.
Listen, when you get to be
my age, you get perspective.
I don't want perspective.
Sorry.
All right.
I don't want the Raisinets.
Why didn't you say that?
I just eat around them.
I don't understand you.
Bye. I'll see you later. Bye.
My man, Ry. Oh, shit.
How you feeling, man?
It's been too long.
Been too long.
Things were hurting with
Neiman on the kits.
Come on, man.
-What?
-He's fine.
I mean, if you say so, yo.
Good seeing you.
Yeah.
Yo, looking good.
-Hey.
-Hey, what's up, bro?
-Hey Ry.
-Have you got a good weekend?
-Yeah, real good.
-Yeah?
-Yeah. Lot of fun.
-Nice.
Hey, don't worry about Greg.
Kid's a dick.
Oh.
-No big deal.
-Good morning, everybody.
Good morning, everybody.
-Good morning.
-All right.
Let's do..".Billy Zane"
from the top, yes? Yes?
-How's that? That's good?
-Little right.
-Okay.
-One, two, three, unh...
Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
All right, let's do... Reese, yeah?
Yo, Ryan.
Watch it.
Yeah.
Accent, yeah...
-Really big on the bottom yet.
-Not today.
Put some sugar on it.
... you embarrass yourself
like what's-his-face.
That was truly pathetic.
<i>Short.</i>
All right. All right.
That's enough of that. Just
back to the core drums, please.
Core players, let's go.
Dude, what have you
been practicing?
May I?
Cute.
Down the line. Trumpets,
bars seven and eight.
Three, four.
Three, four.
Okay. All right.
Trombone, bar 24.
The and of two.
Maybe not.
Tenor, let's start
the pickup to 11.
Three, four.
Same spot. Three, four.
Okay. All right.
You're in the first chair. Let's
see if it's because you're cute.
Three, four.
Yep. That's why.
Drums. Let's... Let's hear a
little double-time swing.
Behind.
Same thing.
Bass, five bars of "Donna Lee".
All right.
Drums, with me.
Thank you, Joe.
No, no, no. Other drums.
Room B-16 tomorrow morning, 6:00 a.m.
Don't be late.
All right, everybody,
from the top.
A one, two, three, unh...
-Hey.
-How are you?
-Good. How-How are you?
-I'm good, thanks.
Good.
-Uh, the usual? You want, like...?
-No.
Look, I don't really know how...
I see you in here a lot, and I think
that you're really pretty and...
Would you wanna go out with me...
ever?
Please go away.
-Oh, my God.
-Plese get out.
-I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
-I'm just messing with you.
-I'm messing with you.
-What? Oh, my God.
I'm sorry.
-That's-That's actually pretty mean.
-That should've... I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to
hurt your feelings.
-It's okay. No big deal.
-What's your name?
Oh, I'm Andrew.
-Andrew.
-Yeah.
-I'm Nicole.
-Nice to meet you, Nicole.
Nice to meet you too.
-So you wanna take me out.
-I would... love to take you out.
-Where do you wanna go?
-Pizza.
-Pizza?
-Yeah.
-I like pizza.
-Yeah, I know this great pizza place.
Cool. Okay, well...
Uh...
I get off at 7 on Monday.
Okay...
-You wanna meet here? Yeah.
-Okay. Yeah. I will.
Great.
Okay. Seven o'clock?
-Mm-hm. Here.
-At 7 p.m.
-Monday. Andrew.
-All right.
-Bye.
-Bye.
<i># Keep me waiting #</i>
<i># 'Cause I'll keep #</i>
<i># waiting #</i>
It's not that bad, man.
She's a go-go dancer.
She could've did porn,
she chose not to.
-Oh, nice.
-That make it better?
Yeah, little bit.
-That's classier.
-I can deal with that.
Bitch had a foot
fetish or something.
-This is good.
-You get on that?
That's it.
You are fucking kidding me.
-You the new alternate?
-Yeah. I'm Andrew Neiman.
Tune the set to B-flat, then you
turn my pages during rehearsal.
Sure.
Excuse me. Um, could
I get a B-flat?
Thank you.
Sorry. Can you...?
Just one more time?
That's a great kit.
I play the new cymbals now.
Milk the cunt!
We got a squeaker today, people.
Neiman.
Nineteen years old.
Isn't he cute?
All right, gang, "Whiplash".
Page. Page!
Barker, that is not your boyfriend's dick.
Do not come early.
Bar 93.
Five, six, and...
Stop.
Now, this one really upsets me. We
have an out-of-tune player here.
Before I continue, would that
player care to identify himself?
No?
Okay, maybe a bug
flew in my ear.
One-fifteen.
Five, six, and...
No. My ears are fine.
We definitely have an
out-of-tune player.
Whoever it is, this
is your last chance.
And there it went.
Now, either you are deliberately
playing out of tune,
and sabotaging my band,
or you don't know
you're out of tune,
which I'm afraid is even worse.
Reeds.
Five, six, and...
Bones.
Five, six, and...
He's here.
Tell me it's not
you, Elmer Fudd.
It's okay. Play.
Do you think you're out of tune?
What are you... There's no fucking Mars
bar down there. What are you looking at?
Look up here. Look at me.
Do you think you're out of tune?
Um...
Yes.
Then why the fuck
didn't you say so?
I've carried your fat
ass for too long, Metz.
I'm not gonna have you
cost us a competition
because your mind's on a Happy
Meal instead of on pitch.
Jackson, congratulations,
you're fourth chair.
Metz, why are you still sitting there?
Get the fuck out!
For the record, Metz wasn't out of tune.
You were, Erickson.
But he didn't know,
and that's bad enough.
All right, take ten. When we
get back, the squeaker's on.
Two, two, three.
Two, two, three.
If he put half the effort
into playing the trombone...
Andrew.
-Parents musicians?
-No.
-What do they do?
-My dad's a writer.
Oh, what's he written?
I guess he's more of
a teacher, really.
Oh.
-College?
-Pennington High School.
-What about your mother, what does she do?
-I don't know. She left when I was a baby.
No musicians in the family?
Well, you just gotta listen
to the greats, then.
Buddy Rich, Jo Jones...
You know, Charlie
Parker became Bird
because Jones threw a
cymbal at his head.
-See what I'm saying?
-Mm-hm.
Listen, the key
is to just relax.
Don't worry about the numbers.
Don't worry about what the
other guys are thinking.
You're here for a reason.
You believe that, right?
Yeah.
Say it.
I'm here for a reason.
Cool.
All right, man. Have fun.
All right, gang, "Whiplash".
A little under tempo, okay?
Neiman, just do your best.
Here we go.
Five, six, and...
Let's hear some fills.
We got Buddy Rich here.
A little trouble there.
Just pick it up at 17.
Ready?
Five, six, and...
Not-not quite my tempo.
Here we go.
Five, six, and...
Downbeat on 18. Okay?
Here we go.
Five, six, and...
Bar 17, the end of four.
Got it?
Five, six, seven...
Not quite my tempo. It's all good.
No worries. Here we go.
Five, six, seven...
You're rushing. Here we go.
Five... Ready? Okay.
Five, six, and...
Dragging just a hair.
Wait for my cue.
Five, six, seven...
Rushing. Five, six, and...
Dragging. Five, six, and...
Why do you suppose I just hurled
a chair at your head, Neiman?
-I don't know.
-Sure you do.
-The tempo?
-Were you rushing or dragging?
I don't-I don't know.
-Start counting!
-Five, six, seven...
In four, damn it. Look at me.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three...
Now, was I rushing
or was I dragging?
-I don't know.
-Count again.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
-One, two, three, four.
-Rushing or dragging?
-Rushing.
-So you do know the difference.
If you deliberately
sabotage my band,
I will fuck you like a pig.
Now, are you a rusher,
or are you a dragger,
or are you gonna be
on my fucking time?
I'm gonna be on your time.
What does that say?
"Quarter note equals 215".
Count me a 215.
One, two, three, four.
-One, two, three, four.
-Jesus fucking Christ.
I didn't know they allowed
retards into Shaffer!
Am I to understand that
you cannot read tempo?
Can you even fucking read music?
What is that?
Eighth note.
-Yes. What is that?
-Dotted 16th note.
Sight-read measure 101.
What are you, a fucking a cappella group?
Play the goddamn kit.
Stop. Now answer my question.
Were you rushing or
were you dragging?
-Answer!
-Rushing.
Oh, my dear God.
Are you one of those
single-tear people?
Do I look like a double fucking
rainbow to you? You must be upset.
-Are you upset?
-No.
No? So you just don't give
a shit about any of this?
-I do give a shit.
-So, are you upset?
Yes or fucking no?
Yes, you are upset.
Yeah.
-Say it.
-I'm upset.
Say it so the whole
band can hear you.
-I'm upset!
-Louder!
-I'm upset!
-Louder!
I'm upset!
You are a worthless, friendless,
faggot-lipped little piece of shit,
whose Mommy left Daddy, when she
figured out he wasn't Eugene O'Neill,
and who's now weeping and
slobbering all over my drum set
like a fucking 9-year-old girl.
So for the final
father-fucking time,
-say it louder!
-I'm upset!
Carl.
Start practicing harder, Neiman.
"Whiplash", bar 125.
Big-boy tempo.
Five, six, and...
This place is nice.
Yeah. I really like the
music that they play.
Mm.
-I mean, the food's good too, but...
-No, the pizza's really good.
"When I Wake".
-What...?
-That's the name of the song.
Oh.
Jackie Hill, July 17th, 1938.
Bob Ellis on the drums.
You know, every time I saw you at the
theater, your eyes were glued to the floor.
-Really?
-Oh... Mm-hm.
My dad says that I have... I
have trouble making eye contact.
My parents like to
criticize me too.
When I was growing up, my mom
said I had a really big chin,
and that's why guys
wouldn't like me.
-Really?
-Yeah.
You don't.
Well, she said my dad
cursed me with one.
It's like Jay Leno. Look.
-No, it's not.
-Yeah, it is.
-I don't... I don't think so at all.
-Well, that's nice.
Your chin's very...
nice. Very nice.
Your mom sounds insane.
Well, she did wanna be an
actress when she was my age.
-What about you?
-What about me?
What do you do?
I go to Fordham.
What do you study?
I don't... have a major yet.
-But, like, what do you want to study?
-I don't really know.
I don't know yet.
So Fordham was just
like a random school?
No, I applied to a bunch of
schools, Fordham let me in.
-Why'd you pick Shaffer?
-It's the best music school in the country.
Well, Fordham was Fordham.
I don't love it
there, to be honest.
-No?
-No.
I...
I don't know. I guess it's just the people.
I don't know if they like me very much.
I'm from Arizona and I
think they can... see it.
I kinda feel the same way
about people at Shaffer.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah. I don't-I don't think
they like me too much.
But I don't... I don't...
I don't care too much. I think it just...
It changes.
You know, people change
and things work out.
No, no, I know, I know.
I just...
I feel really
homesick sometimes.
I don't know.
It kind of pisses me off when
people pretend like they're not.
In college, you know?
Maybe I'm literally the
only one, I don't know.
I still go to the
movies with my dad.
-Hey... How are you, man?
-Hey, good to see you.
And you. And please, is
this really Eva? Wow.
Last time I saw you,
you were very tiny.
Are you playing an
instrument yet?
She started piano last week.
Hey, when you're a big college kid,
will you come play in my band?
-Would you like that?
-Be my piano player?
Excellent. Give me five, baby.
All right. Hey, great to see you.
Great seeing you.
-See you after the show, okay?
-All right, absolutely.
All right, cheers.
Listen up, cocksuckers!
Hurry the fuck up.
Get your music.
"Irene" only. Set one.
Rhythm section out first.
Tanner, the kit is a fucking tonal
catastrophe. Get it in tune, all right?
Rhythm and soloists, bar 45.
We're gonna pick up the
tempo there, all right?
Bar 106, brass, do not
forget we sharp that ninth.
Everybody remember, Lincoln Center
and its ilk use these competitions
to decide who they're interested
in and who they're not.
I'm not gonna have my reputation
in that department tarnished
by a bunch of fucking
limp-dick, sour-note,
flatter-than-their-girlfriends,
flexible-tempo dipshits. Got it?
One more thing.
Eugene, give me that.
If I ever find one of
these lying around again,
I swear to fucking God, I
will stop being so polite.
Get the fuck out of my sight
before I demolish you.
Stage right, in order, now.
I can still fucking
see you, Mini-Me!
Let's go. Hurry the fuck up.
Let's go.
The Shaffer Conservatory
Studio Band.
Hold on this for the second set.
He's dumb but he's not stupid.
At the end of the day, he wants
a career, as dumb as he is.
But as long as Fletcher is here,
Fudd doesn't have a chance
of getting back in the band, so
why would he jeopardize that?
-I need to look at the music.
-Oh yeah, it's right here.
-Why isn't it on you?
-Where's the folder?
-You're joking, right?
-I've no... No...
-You're fucking around?
-I literally...
No, I-I swear I just had
it here two seconds ago.
-No, no...
-It's gotta be around here.
-Did you see...?
-How could you be so fucking stupid?
I know. Maybe a janitor
came by or something...
-A janitor?
-Yeah.
Find the fucking folder!
A fucking janitor?
You're a dumb fuck! A dumb fuck!
-Find the folder!
-Okay, I'm sorry.
Tanner!
Jesus fucking Christ,
where have you been?
-Uh, we have an issue.
-Okay, now is not the time.
I gave Neiman the folder
and Neiman lost it.
-Neiman lost it.
-Yes, sir.
The folder was your fucking
responsibility, Tanner.
Why would you give it to Neiman?
Right?
Give a calculator to a fucking retard,
he's gonna try to turn on a TV with it.
Now, get your sticks,
get your ass on-stage.
I... I can't.
You can't?
I... I can't go on-stage. I
don't know the charts by heart.
-Are you fucking kidding me?
-I... You know this.
I need the music. It's my
memory, I need visual cues.
-Visual cues.
-Yes. It's a medical...
A medical condition? What, are
you fucking Sanjay Gupta?
Play the goddamn music!
-I can't.
-I can.
-You know "Whiplash" by heart?
-Yes. Every measure.
All right. Well, you better fucking
hope your memory doesn't fail you.
And I hope you play it a whole lot better
than you did last month in the reherasal.
Because I do not intend
to start losing now.
Get your sticks and get your
fucking ass on-stage. On-stage!
<i>And in first place,</i>
<i>Shaffer Conservatory.</i>
Hey. Don't fucking
touch my folder, man.
Do not touch this kit.
All right, let's get
to work, ladies.
Tanner, what you doing? It's core only
today. I don't have time for alternates.
"Cherokee". From the top.
Tanner, are you a fucking statue?
Let's go. Get off the stool.
Don't forget to turn Neiman's pages.
Here we go.
One, two, three, four.
Two, two, three, four.
<i>Andy, what did you
do to your hand?</i>
-Is that from drumming?
-Yeah. It's nothing.
So how's it going
with the Studio Band?
Good.
Yeah, I think he
likes me more now.
And his opinion means a
lot to you, don't it?
Yeah.
Wanna grab the shakers?
Jimbo? Overcooked.
You can barely chew this.
He just laughs. So how's
the drumming going, Andy?
Yeah, it's going really well.
I'm-I'm the new core drummer, so...
-Hey.
-Congratulations.
Tom Brady.
-Did you hear, Jim?
-No, what happened?
-Trav got named this year's MVP.
-That's fantastic, Travis.
Yeah and Dustin is
heading up Model UN,
soon to be Rhodes Scholar
and who knows what else.
And Jim, teacher of the year.
-Well, hey, listen...
-I mean, come on.
The talent at this
table, that is stunning.
And Andy, with your drumming.
It's going okay, Andy?
Yeah, it's going really,
really well, actually.
I'm part of Shaffer's
top jazz orchestra,
which means..., it's the
best in the country.
And I'm a core member
so I'll start playing in competitions.
And actually I just...
I found out I'm the youngest
person in the entire band.
How do-How do you know who wins in a...
music competition? Isn't it subjective?
No. Does the studio
get you a job?
No, it's not an actual studio.
It's just the name of the ensemble, but
yeah, it's a big step forward in my career.
Well, I'm so glad you figured it out.
It's a nasty business, I am sure.
Hey, are you gonna tell them
about your game this week?
-Living up to your title...
-I scored a 93-yard touchdown.
School record, school
record, school record.
-Is that true? That's fantastic.
-It's Division Three.
It's Carlton football. It's not even
Division... Two, it's Division Three.
-You got any friends, Andy?
-No.
-Oh, why is that?
-I don't know.
I just never really saw the use.
Who are you gonna
play with otherwise?
Lennon and McCartney, they were
school buddies, am I right?
Charlie Parker didn't know anybody till
Jo Jones threw a cymbal at his head.
So, that's your idea
of success, huh?
I think, being the greatest musician of the
20th century is anybody's idea of success.
Dying broke and drunk
and full of heroin
at the age of 34 is not
exactly my idea of success.
I'd rather die drunk, broke at 34 and have
people at a dinner table talk about me,
than live to be rich and sober at
90 and nobody remember who I was.
But your friends will remember
you, that's the point.
None of us were friends with
Charlie Parker. That's the point.
Travis and Dustin, they have plenty
of friends and plenty of purpose.
I'm sure they'll make great
school board presidents someday.
Oh, that's what this is all about,
you think you're better than us?
-Catch on quick. Are you in Model UN?
-I got a reply for you, Andrew.
You think Carlton football is a joke?
Come play with us.
Four words you will never
hear from the NFL.
-Who wants dessert?
-Heard from Lincoln Center?
Okay, get out of here. Pick up the new
chart by the door on your way out.
Rehearsal 9 p.m. sharp tonight.
That's how long you have to learn it.
Neiman. Stick around a minute.
See the tempo marking on there?
Uh...
"Quarter note equals 330". Oh.
That is a double-time swing.
-That's what got you in here, right?
-Oh, yeah.
As fate would have it, I recently
stumbled across another kid
in the practice room working
on his double-time swing.
So I'm gonna give him a shot.
-Am I late?
-Perfect timing.
Come on in, Connolly.
-Uh, you two know each other, right?
-Yeah, yeah, Nassau band.
Hey, what's up, Andrew?
Now..., Connolly, I've made
Neiman a temporary core,
but with this
competition coming up
I just wanna make very sure this chart
is in the best shape it can be.
Yeah, this one
right here, right?
I gave Connolly the
chart this morning.
All I wanna do now is just to give
you both a crack at it, all right?
So, Neiman, go ahead, jump on the
kit, we'll take it from the top.
Okay.
I don't want you to worry
about hits right now.
-Just tempo, okay?
-Okay.
All set?
One, two...
-Not quite my tempo. Connolly.
-Okay.
-Yeah, I can take it right from the top.
-Connolly, go ahead.
-I can do...
-No. We'll go with Connolly now.
Hey, do you mind?
Okay, man, ready?
One and two and...
-Perfect, Connolly.
-Oh, my God.
See, this to me is the
beauty of Studio Band.
You walk in here an alternate, who
knows when you could be the new core.
-Oh, my God, are you serious?
-Thanks.
That shit?
Fletcher.
Thanks, man. Here you go.
Don't worry about Fletcher.
He's more bark than bite.
Hey, look, you... I can
play these charts.
-Now is not the time, I swear to God.
-I can play it, okay?
I said not now! If you want
the fucking part, earn it.
<i>I'm just gonna lay it out there.</i>
This is why I don't think
we should be together.
And I've thought about it a lot,
and this is what's gonna happen.
Okay, I'm gonna keep
pursuing what I'm pursuing.
And because I'm doing that, it's gonna
take up more and more of my time.
And I'm not gonna be able to
spend as much time with you.
And even when I do spend time with you,
I'm gonna be thinking about drumming.
And I'm gonna be thinking about
jazz, about my charts and all that.
And because of that, you're
gonna start to resent me.
And you're gonna tell me to
ease up on the drumming,
spend more time with you, because
you're not feeling important.
And I'm not gonna be able to do that.
And really I'm gonna start to resent you
for even asking me to stop drumming.
And we're just gonna start
to hate each other.
And it's gonna get very...
it's gonna be ugly.
And so for those reasons,
I'd rather just, you know,
break it off clean.
Because I wanna be great.
And you're not?
I wanna be one of the greats.
And I would stop you
from doing that?
Yeah.
You know I would stop
you from doing that?
You know that for a fact?
Yes.
And I'd barely see you anyway?
Yeah.
When I did see you,
you'd treat me like shit
because I'm just some girl who
doesn't know what she wants.
And you have a path and you're going
to be great and I'm gonna be forgotten
and therefore you won't be able
to give me the time of day
because you have bigger
things to pursue.
That's exactly my point.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You're right. We
should not be dating.
I'm okay. Thanks.
Fuck! Fuck!
Fucking piece of shit!
Fuck you!
The fuck!
Fucking piece of shit! Come on!
Um...
Sorry, we have a new player.
Ryan Connolly.
Um... Ahem.
I'm sorry.
Guys, just put your instruments
down for a minute.
Just listen for a minute.
Six years ago...
I came across a kid in a practice
room working on his scales.
He was early second year and he'd
started at Shaffer with a lot of hope.
Like all you guys.
But the truth was that he barely
squeaked in to begin with and...
... he was really struggling.
The faculty were all telling
him, "Maybe this isn't for you".
But they didn't see what I saw.
This scared, skinny kid
cursing himself because he
couldn't get his scales right.
I saw a drive in him.
And I put him in Studio Band.
And when he graduated,
Marsalis made him third
trumpet at Lincoln Center.
A year later, he was first.
That's who you're
listening to now.
His name was Sean Casey.
I found out this morning that...
... Sean...
... died yesterday...
... in a car accident.
And I just...
I wanted you guys to know
he was a beautiful player.
I just thought you should know.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
Let's get to work, huh? How
about "Caravan", bar 105?
Two bars for free.
One and two and...
It's not-not quite right, Connolly.
Um...
I'd like to try Neiman on this.
Maybe now's the time for
Neiman to earn the part.
One and two and...
Nope, I guess not. Tanner?
One and two and...
Motherfucker!
Connolly, get your
ass back on the kit.
We will stay here for as long as it takes
until one of you faggots can play in time.
One and two and...
Looks like that might be all night.
Neiman.
One and two and...
Not my fucking tempo!
Sorry, guys. Hate to
put you through this.
If you need to fucking take
a dump or get a coffee,
whatever, now might
be a good time.
We're gonna stay until I find a
drummer who can fucking play in time.
I apologize to the musicians.
Seriously, take 10,
20, a fucking hour.
You hear me, cocksuckers? You better
start shitting me perfect 400s.
Connolly, get your fucking
ass back on the kit.
Is that really the fastest you can
play, you worthless Hymie fuck?
No wonder Mommy ran out on you.
Get off the fucking kit.
And here comes Mr. Gay Pride of
the Upper West Side himself.
Unfortunately this is not
a Bette Midler concert.
We will not be serving
Cosmopolitans and Baked Alaska,
so just play faster than you give
fucking hand jobs, will you, please?
One, two, one, two.
Not even fucking close.
Let's go with the Irish
Mick Paddy cracker now.
You know, you actually do look
quite a bit like a leprechaun.
I'm gonna start
calling you Flannery.
Get off!
What the fuck are you looking for?
There's no pot of gold down there.
... Adjusting the seat? Really?
That's been your fucking problem
the whole time? The seat height?
So now you have it, right?
Go.
Bullshit! Fuck you!
Neiman.
Maybe it's time
to finally bring this home.
What do you say?
Show me.
Don't slow down.
Pick it up.
Faster!
Faster!
Faster!
Faster!
Faster!
Keep playing!
Keep playing! Keep playing!
Keep playing!
Don't stop.
Neiman,
you earned the part.
Alternates, you wanna clean
the blood off my drum set?
Okay, we can start now.
5 p.m. call tomorrow
in Dunellen.
Give yourselves at least two hours to get
there from the city this time, all right?
Save your travel receipts.
Or don't. I don't give a shit.
Hey excuse me, do you
know where the cabs are?
No, you gotta call the cabs.
I konw, they say the cabs
suppose to be right here?
No, you gotta call. Then they
gonna stay here forever.
Okay, how do I get to Hargrove?
Hey. Come on. Please, come on.
You're still open.
You're still open. Come on.
Come on. Come on.
Yeah, hello?
<i>Neiman, where the fuck are you man?
Call time was five.</i>
I know, I know. I'm almost there.
I'm almost there. I'm right there.
-<i>We're on-stage in twenty.</i>
-I know we're on-stage in twenty.
-<i>And Fletcher's got Connolly warming up.</i>
-God fucking da... Okay.
You just tell that little
fucking redhead I'll...
I'm gonna be there, okay? Fuck!
Hey. Hey. Sorry I'm late.
Well, glad you could fit us into
your busy schedule, darling.
I know. Look I'm sorry I'm late,
but I'm here, I'm ready to go.
Connolly's playing the part.
Yeah, like fucking hell
he's playing my part.
What the fuck did
you just say to me?
It's my part.
It's my part and I decide
who to lend it to.
Usually it's somebody
that has fucking sticks.
I left them in the car. I'll be right back.
Take me five minutes.
I'm warming up the band now.
-Look, I can use Ryan's sticks...
-Neiman, you lost the fucking part.
No, I didn't. Look, you can't
fucking do this to me.
-Can't?
-Yeah.
When did you become a fucking
expert on what I can or can not do,
-you fucking weepy-willow shit sack?
-I earned that part.
You never earned anything. God,
you are a self-righteous prick.
The only reason you're a fucking core
is because you misplaced a folder.
Only reason you're in Studio Band
to begin with is because I told you
exactly what I'd be
asking for in Nassau.
-Am I wrong?
-Yeah.
Yeah, I'm in Studio Band because
-I'm the best player...
-Hey, why don't you just back off?!
Hey, fuck off, Johnny Utah.
Turn my pages, bitch.
Hey. I can cut you any
fucking time I want.
-You would've cut me by now.
-Try me, you fucking weasel.
At 5:30, that's in exactly 11
minutes, my band is on-stage.
If your ass is not on that stool with
your own fucking sticks in hand,
or if you make one
fucking mistake,
one, I will drum your
ass back to Nassau
where you can turn pages until you
graduate or fucking drop out.
By the time you're
done at Shaffer,
you're gonna make Daddy look
like a fucking success story.
Got it? Or we can let Johnny
Utah play the part. You choose.
That's my part. I'll
be on your stage.
-Fuck you.
-You got 10 minutes,
you fucking pathetic,
pansy-ass fruit fuck.
-Hey, tell Fletcher I'm coming.
-What the fuck took you so long man,
<i>We're moving on-stage right now.</i>
I know, I got locked in my car, it's fine.
I got locked in my car, I'm coming.
<i>Left turn, 200 feet.</i>
-<i>Are you driving, man?</i>
-No.
<i>What the hell was that noise?</i>
Okay look, why don't you just tell Fletcher
that I'm coming, you motherfucker?
Hey. Hey, hey.
Are you okay? Are you okay?
-I gotta get my sticks.
-No, no, no, no, stay away from the car.
-I've called 911.
-Look, I gotta go.
-Just a couple more blocks.
-No, no, sir.
-You don't have to go anywhere...
-Just a couple more blocks.
-Sir, sir, no you don't have to...
-Please get off me...
Hey, guy. What the
fuck happened to you?
<i>The Shaffer Conservatory
Studio Band.</i>
Neiman, what the fuck?
<i>Fuck.</i>
Neiman...
You're done.
Gentlemen, ladies, I apologize
on behalf of Shaffer
Conservatory.
Piece of shit. I'll
just fucking kill you.
-Fuck you.
-Get the...
-Get the fuck off me. Fuck off.
-Get off me.
Fuck you.
Fuck you!
Fuck you, Fletcher! Fuck you!
Get off. Fuck. Piece of shit!
Fuck you!
When did you start
talking to her?
Your father got in contact
with us this week.
Does the name Sean Casey
mean anything to you?
You know of his death?
Last month, he hanged
himself in his apartment.
What does that have
to do with me?
Sean suffered from
anxiety and depression.
His mother claims this started during
his time as Fletcher's student.
Now, the Caseys aren't wealthy,
they don't wanna file suit.
So, what do they want?
To make sure that Terence Fletcher is never
allowed to do this to another student.
<i>Hey, Dad, look at my paradiddle.</i>
<i>Yeah, that's my boy.</i>
-He didn't do anything.
-What is wrong with you? It's over, okay?
He's out of your life. Why would you let
him get away with what he did to you?
Would you characterize his
conduct as extreme, Andrew?
Did he ever intentionally
inflict emotional distress?
This would not be a
public hearing, you know.
Fletcher would never know
it was you who spoke up.
Why would you do this to me?
Do you think that I would let
him put my son through hell
and then just walk
away scot-free?
Don't you know I would
never let that happen?
That there is nothing in the world
more important to me than you?
Don't you know that?
Andrew?
Andrew?
Just tell me what to say.
Hey...
<i>I'd give anything to be there
again this fall, wouldn't you?</i>
<i>I guess I like weddings, provided
of course they're not mine.</i>
<i>Oh, marriages are
very healthy, sir.</i>
<i>They say married men live
much longer than bachelors.</i>
<i>That's true. They're only trying to outlive
their wives so they can be bachelors again.</i>
<i>Haven't you ever thought
of getting married, sir?</i>
<i>Once in fact back I did.</i>
<i>The young lady changed her
mind at the last moment.</i>
<i>I've been deeply indebted
to her ever since.</i>
All right... And I-I loaded
the pantry up with Gushers.
-Saw that.
-Okay.
All right.
Thanks.
Right on, man.
Andrew.
Hey.
I don't know if you heard. Uh...
I'm not at Shaffer anymore.
Yeah, I did hear that.
Did you quit?
Not exactly.
Some parents got a kid from
Sean Casey's year, I think,
to say some things about me.
Although why anybody
would have anything
other than peaches and cream
to say about me is a mystery.
Yeah.
-That's a good laugh, right?
-I'm sorry.
-No, listen, hey... I get it.
-I'm sorry.
I know I made enemies.
I'm conducting a little, though.
They brought back the
JVC Fest this year.
They got me opening in a couple
of weeks with a pro band.
That's great.
Yeah. It's all right.
Truth is, I don't think
people understood
what it was I was
doing at Shaffer.
I wasn't there to conduct.
Any fucking moron can wave his
arms and keep people in tempo.
I was there to push people
beyond what's expected of them.
I believe that is...
an absolute necessity.
Otherwise, we're depriving the
world of the next Louis Armstrong.
The next Charlie Parker.
I told you that story about how Charlie
Parker became Charlie Parker, right?
-Jo Jones threw a cymbal at his head.
-Exactly.
Parker's a young kid,
pretty good on the sax.
Gets up to play at a cutting
session, and he fucks it up.
And Jones nearly
decapitates him for it.
And he's laughed off-stage.
Cries himself to sleep that night, but
the next morning, what does he do?
He practices.
And he practices and he practices
with one goal in mind,
never to be laughed at again.
And a year later, he goes back to the
Reno and he steps up on that stage,
and plays the best motherfucking
solo the world has ever heard.
So imagine if Jones
had just said:
"Well, that's okay, Charlie.
That was all right. Good job".
And then Charlie thinks to himself,
"Well, shit, I did do a pretty good job".
End of story.
No bird.
That, to me, is an
absolute tragedy.
But that's just what
the world wants now.
People wonder why jazz is dying.
I tell you, man, and every
Starbucks "jazz" album
just proves my point, really.
There are no two words in the
English language more harmful
than "good job".
But is there a line?
You know, maybe you go too far and you
discourage the next Charlie Parker
-from ever becoming Charlie Parker.
-No, man, no.
Because the next Charlie Parker
would never be discouraged.
Yeah.
The truth is, Andrew, I...
... never really had
a Charlie Parker.
But I tried.
I actually fucking tried.
And that's more than
most people ever do.
And I will never apologize
for how I tried.
I'll see you later.
Yeah.
Hey, Andrew. Listen, I've no idea
how you're gonna take this, but...
the band I'm leading for JVC,
my drummer is not cutting it.
You understand what I'm saying?
No.
I'm using the Studio
Band playlist.
You know, "Caravan", "Whiplash".
I need somebody who really
knows those charts.
What about Ryan Connolly?
All Connolly ever was to
me was incentive for you.
Tanner? Tanner
switched to premed.
I guess he got discouraged.
Hey. Uh...
Take the weekend.
Think about it.
<i>-Hello?
-Hey, Nicole, it's Andrew.</i>
-<i>Hi.</i>
-Hey.
It's been a while since...
I talked to you. Um...
Look, I...
I'm really sorry
about everything.
I know that's not...
you know, enough, but I'm
just really sorry. Um...
But anyway, I got... I actually
have this show this weekend.
It's a, uh...
Like, a JVC thing. And I didn't know
if maybe you'd wanna go, and...
... we, you know, maybe get some,
like, pizza afterwards, and...
..., like, complain about
our schools again.
<i>What is...? You said Jayvees?</i>
No, it's, heh, JVC.
It's like a...
It's a jazz thing.
Yeah.
<i>Oh, okay.</i>
<i>Well, I don't know if I can come.
I...</i>
<i>I'll have to check
with my boyfriend.</i>
Okay.
Yeah.
<i>Yeah, I'll tell 'im and I'll
check, but I don't know.</i>
<i>I don't really think he
likes jazz music though.</i>
Yeah, I mean, not for everybody.
Okay. Well, I guess maybe
I'll see you guys there.
-Okay.
-Okay.
Bye.
All right, gang, listen up. Now, for
those of you who are new at this,
which looks like it might be everybody
except Cal, tonight could change your life.
The folks out there make a phone call,
you could be a Blue Note signee,
an EMC client, a
Lincoln Center core.
On the other hand,
if you drop the ball, you might
be looking for a new line of work
because the other thing about
these cats is they never forget.
We all set?
All right. Let's have fun.
You think I'm fucking stupid?
-What?
-I know it was you.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
We're...
We're very excited to be here kicking
off the JVC Festival this year.
I'm Terence Fletcher and these are some
of the best musicians in New York,
which means they're some of the
best musicians in the world.
And we're gonna do some
old standards for you,
but first we're gonna
start with a new tune
by Tim Simonec
called "Upswingin'".
What the fuck you doing?
Come on, man.
Yeah, I guess maybe
you don't have it.
That was a little extra avant-garde
there from the rhythm section...
Come on, let's go home.
What are you doing?
Uh...
Now we're gonna slow
it down a little bit.
I'm guessing most of you
folks have heard...
I'll cue you in.
"Caravan".
Three, four.
I'm gonna gouge out your
motherfucking eyes.
-Andrew, what are you doing, man?
-I'll cue you.
