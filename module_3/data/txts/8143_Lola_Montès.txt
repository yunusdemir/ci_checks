And now, Iadies and gentIemen,
the moment you've aII been waiting for
The most sensationaI act of the century
Entertainment, emotion,
action, history
A creature a hundred times
more murderous
than any beast in our menagerie
A bIoodthirsty monster
with the eyes of an angeI
Ravaged hearts, squandered fortunes,
the saraband of Iovers, scepters,
crowns, an authentic revoIution
Triumph and downfaII
LoIa Montès,
Countess Maria DoIores of LandsfeId
In the very fIesh!
Here, Iadies and gentIemen,
the truth, nothing but the truth
on the extraordinary Iife
of LoIa Montès,
reenacted by the entire company
in pantomime, acrobatics,
tabIeaux vivants,
with music and dance
and with the entire orchestra
I'II be aII right
The first part of the show! Questions
Ask your questions,
Iadies and gentIemen
LoIa Montès wiII answer
the most shocking questions,
the most intimate questions,
the most indiscreet questions,
about her scandaIous career
as femme fataIe
Don't be shy, Iadies and gentIemen,
25 cents per question
Now, Iadies and gentIemen, it's my
pIeasure to announce that the countess,
in a spirit of humbIe penitence
and mortification
benevoIence
charity
wiII donate the proceeds
of her performance
for the reIief of faIIen women
Come aIong now,
Iadies and gentIemen, no faIse modesty,
She'II teII aII!
<i>Wa</i>/<i>t, madam, I'II be r</i>/<i>ght there.</i>
Ask your questions
Going once
Going twice
Going three times
<i>Where d</i>/<i>d she dance</i>
<i>w</i>/<i>thout her costume?</i>
In Paris
<i>Speak up!</i>
In Paris
Did the doctor give you something?
Maurice went to the pharmacy
<i>Is</i> /<i>t true that...</i>
<i>that</i> /<i>n Mun</i>/<i>ch there are men</i>
<i>who dr</i>/<i>nk s</i>/<i>x or seven I</i>/<i>ters</i>

UnfortunateIy, your question is
compIeteIy irreIevant to our show
No offense, my dear friend
<i>Where are your ch</i>/<i>Idren, LoIa?</i>
The countess has no chiIdren
<i>Was her mother I</i>/<i>ke her?</i>
Objection! You may ask about LoIa,
not her mother
Refund!
<i>Wh</i>/<i>ch does she Iove best.: Iove or money?</i>
Both!
<i>What are LoIa's measurements, pIease?</i>
Later
<i>Does LoIa wear a bra?</i>
Later
<i>- How many Iovers?</i>
- Oh! There's a question there Repeat!
<i>How many Iovers, LoIa?</i>
WorId record Good question
We are aII going to count together
So, is it serious?
He said I mustn't drink
and smoke anymore
Easier said than done!
The parade of Iovers!
Bring on the Iovers!
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine
ten, 1 1 , 1 2, 1 3, 1 4
Go on, Iadies and gentIemen, ask away
OnIy 25 cents to ask a question
For the faIIen women
There are many of them
<i>Why d</i>/<i>dn't you ever stay</i>
<i>w</i>/<i>th your Iovers, countess?</i>
Because a femme fataIe never stays
She stays nowhere
<i>Does the countess</i>
<i>st</i>/<i>II remember the past?</i>
<i>Remember the past? Remember the past?</i>
Another five Ieagues, Mr Liszt
So keep going, I'm in a hurry
Fine, sir
Off you go, quickIy!
One more hour
Does it seem too Iong?
How about you?
EarIy tomorrow morning
we wiII Ieave for Rome
Oh, there! Wait!
About the battement de pied
you shouId pIay faster
I cannot stay on my toes that Iong
Up to now,
dancers have danced
according to my music
and not I to theirs
My name is Franz Liszt, my dear
Are you eager to arrive in Rome?
How about you?
Things are going badIy between us,
very badIy
I know how it is
when
When a man is attractive
and you are terribIy attractive
it's easy to yieId, to hoId on,
to go aImost too far
Now we are embarrassed
by aII those foIIies
We are starting to watch each other
We are trying to find each other again,
to recognize ourseIves
and our answers become questions
When you ask
Don't you Iove me anymore?
I answer, ''Do you?''
It's not an answer
That carriage is an answer
It's your carriage isn't it?
Yes
Is it true that it aIways foIIows you
when you traveI with a Iover?
I Iike to have at hand
a means to go away
Don't you ever dream
of an affair with no end?
Oh! Dreaming!
Dreams are private
We can't share them with anybody,
they are sometimes pretty embarrassing
Embarrassing! Why?
Because they don't Iast?
- Maybe!
- Because there's an awakening?
You just have to cIing to them, Iive
them before it's too Iate, right?
Life for me is a movement
You are tired from the trip
No, a IittIe bit sad
But if the inn is charming
a nice dinner, it wiII pass
How is it going?
Fine
So, what about LoIa?
- It's a matter of hours
- So much the better
The food here is not good
Did you see the Roman citadeI in Verona?
Spaghetti aI fettuccini
Ah, they put oiI in everything,
what a country!
ShouId I grease your carriage
for tomorrow morning, madam?
Perhaps
Did you hear that? Perhaps, she said!
Thank you for your Iie,
thank you for aIIowing me
to beIieve that I'm the one Ieaving,
not you
Here, darIing
Do you hear me?
Don't you want to hear me?
You might at Ieast say good-bye
It wouId be poIite
I didn't want to wake you
No need to be that poIite
I think you agree
this is the best for both of us
For the first time in a Iong time,
we totaIIy agree on something
Come and kiss me
Better than that
A fareweII kiss is important
It is something to be cherished
There it's over
It's over you know Iife Iove
I know
There
We'II meet again
I traveI a Iot
So do I
CouId such a coincidence be!
AII Iife is coincidence You'II see
One night we'II be in the same town
I'II be dancing
and you'II be giving a concert
It wouId have to be a reaIIy big town
But we'II share the same pubIic
I'II Ieave my theater in time
to hear your encore
I'II appIaud you and come backstage
WiII you be pIeased?
Yes
You'II have a date with another woman,
and I with another man, and we won't go
No, we won't go
For one night we'II hide together
We wiII be together as we are now
- Won't it be wonderfuI?
- It wiII be wonderfuI
I'II see to the Ioading of the Iuggage
Yes, go ahead
Everything is ready, madam
Yes, I'm coming
Ravishing
So, LoIa
Good-bye Good-bye, Franz
I see that you are true to my music!
Good-bye!
- It was to be expected
- Yes Perhaps it's aII for the best
- So, is it reaIIy over?
- Do you Iove me?
Of course
LoIa Ieaves the ring
with her entourage
A change of scene!
A change of costumes!
We'II Iook back to her earIy days
Her extraordinary career took root
in the beautifuI and generous soiI
of a happy famiIy Iife
We wiII re-create,
Iadies and gentIemen,
her happy youth
and her radiant adoIescence
Fetch me a handkerchief, hurry
TweIve tabIeaux vivants,
Iadies and gentIemen
With the whoIe company
The authentic cradIe,
Iadies and gentIemen
Here's your medicine, madam
80 cents
Thank you, Maurice How many drops?
It's dark in here
Ten or 1 2
Yes, ten or 1 2
An exceIIent mother,
attentive and devoted
A modeI father, strict,

UnforgettabIe days, carefree, innocent!

HeIIo, madam
Thank you
Do you Iike this?
You stiII Iike it the same way?
Oh, yes, madam I hope it never ends
You're right Go
It's bitter!
AIas!
Death of the coIoneI in service

Look at the ship
There, Lieutenant James
He's aIready there
Who?
He's reaIIy very nice
He's so obIiging, sociabIe and amusing
I promise you,
you are unfair with him, darIing
Good evening, dear friend,
how was your trip? PIease foIIow me
Watch out
Captain, here's Mrs Craigie,
whom I was taIking about
DeIighted, madam!
WeIcome on board!
LoIa!
It is aII right Cabin 1 1
It's about the cabins
I have to expIain
I'm in the number 1 1
and you are in the dormitory
I wiII get bored if I'm not with you
Me too, darIing, but
but it can't be heIped
The steward had reserved
cabin 1 1 for me
There must be cabins with two beds!
They are aII taken by coupIes
Ah! Here it is!
WiII you pIease show her
to the dormitory?
To the right, mademoiseIIe,
to the right
- See you soon, at dinner, right?
- See you soon At dinner, my dear
- This way, mademoiseIIe
- Thank you
- Straight ahead, mademoiseIIe
- Thank you
Oh, I have a cousin that aIso grew up
in CaIcutta But she studied in France
Are there many singIe cabins?
Oh, no, mademoiseIIe, very few
AII cabins are for two, three or four
But my cousin wasn't in Paris,
she was in GrenobIe
Everybody is in Gre Excuse me
AII my famiIy is in GrenobIe
I was born in GrenobIe too
- Do you know GrenobIe, mademoiseIIe?
- No, not yet
- What is this dormitory Iike?
- It's here
Don't stack your cases
They'd faII in a storm
AIIow me, mademoiseIIe
MademoiseIIe wiII unpack aIone
She's oId enough
to Iook after herseIf
Good evening, mademoiseIIe
She is crying
Look, Thérèse, she is crying
And now, Iadies and gentIemen,
captain, time for the dance
Everybody, dance!
- I think it's your bedtime, my dear
- AIready?
Good night
- Good night, my dear
- Good night, Mother
I think I must speak to LoIa tomorrow
Let's not rush anything
Go to sIeep quickIy,
my treasure, it's Iate
She's ravishing
ShaII we dance?
Good evening, mademoiseIIe!
Do you aIready go to bed?
Were you naughty?
I hate men who onIy dance
with their wives
and won't Iet them dance
with other men
- Do you mean me?
- No, my poor husband
If he had prevented me from dancing
with other men,
I wouId have never met you
<i>Europe at Iast! Par</i>/<i>s.</i>
<i>The h</i>/<i>gh I</i>/<i>fe.</i>
<i>LoIa f</i>/<i>nds a husband.</i>
WeII, are you sIeeping?
It's wonderfuI but I'm afraid
it wiII have an unhappy ending
Come aIong, hurry!
You know we're expected
Are you coming?
Go and ask for box 21
Come on, come on, Iet's go!
And do smiIe
There is no need to suIk!
See see? You'II have aII that
I don't care
Oh! Yet! The dresses,
the jeweIs, it matters!
I wouId have doubts,
if I didn't know the man,
but the baron was
an oId friend of your father
WeII, he must be very oId
OId, oId it's a matter of taste
He's a fine figure of a man,
very eIegant
Of course,
you married a much oIder man
Your father wasn't so oId
OId enough to be my father
The baron was our banker
Bankers grow oId more sIowIy than cIients
I'm not forcing you, you know,
you are aIways free to refuse
As for the baron,
I danced with him when I was a girI
Then you shouId marry him
What insoIence!
Come aIong! Come aIong now!
He doesn't know me
He'II be disappointed
I sent him your portrait
He won't be disappointed
You're not bad Iooking
If he asks if you pIay the piano,
say yes
As a matter of fact,
say ''yes'' to everything
This way
Opera aIways overwheImed me,
but if I don't spend an hour there,
I won't sIeep
The king must be obeyed
Otherwise,
the monarchy makes no sense
I'm deIighted to see you
- AIIow me
- PIease
The baron asked me to apoIogize
for his absence
Lieutenant James
He was obIiged to Ieave suddenIy
to Baden-Baden
This is my daughter
His gout you know
My compIiments, mademoiseIIe
I had seen your portrait,
but reaIIy sincereIy, I am
And weII, you wiII, of course,
join the baron in Baden-Baden
AIIow me pIease, gentIemen
In the meantime, we'II discuss
certain important matters
But come on! No! No! Prussia
Prussia is no danger!
You are reaIIy sure about it!
It's EngIand!
I teII you it is aIways EngIand!
TeII me, that young man is he?
Oh, no! He's traveIing with me
My husband Iiked him very much
He was his adjutant
He's no Ionger in the army
WouId you Iike Friday morning?
Ten o'cIock at the soIicitor's?
Everything wiII be settIed
for the best incIuding the wiII
Oh! We've got
to anticipate everything
With pIeasure But I must expIain
You see, there's no fortune on our side
On the contrary, it's
It's very hard to expIain
She's gone
What do you mean, gone?
She must be mad!
Go and find her! Come on, hurry!
- What is wrong, my dear friend?
- Oh, nothing! Nothing at aII!
LoIa!
Go away, I hate you
AII this is your fauIt!
How can you say such a thing?
You know very weII
that I didn't infIuence your mother
I pIayed no part in this matter
I wiII be given to a rich oId man
I don't want to I don't want
Your fan
You know very weII that
You know very weII
that I'd do anything for you
Are you reaIIy my friend?
Do you Iike me a IittIe?
Very much
- Very much?
- Very much!
When I first saw you
with your mother, I was
WeII, do something, I don't know
Marry me!
Isn't that what usuaIIy happens?

What did I do again? Has one

You want to prevent me

What's wrong?
Are you going to Ieave me yet again?
You forget, my dear,

You can't escape a Iove match

Come on, LoIa, don't go, pIease,

He has his moods

The countess couId easiIy
have Iived off men,
but she had other ambitions, she Ionged
to reaIize her chiIdhood dream
to become a baIIerina
But it takes hard work
to become a great dancer Maestro
Thank you, maestro
After many years of study,
she made her debut
on November 1 8th, 1 841 , in Madrid
An overwheIming success!
Go, LoIa, go!
Rome! Great box office!
More!
Warsaw! Ah!
On the 7th of January 1 842,
a poIiticaI scandaI expIodes in Warsaw
The Russian viceroy,
GeneraI Paskievitch,
faIIs madIy in Iove with LoIa
She spurns the tyrant,
but tyrants have other means
of of seduction
<i>The generaI sends h</i>/<i>s Cossacks,</i>
<i>the Cossacks attack,</i>
<i>the Cossacks carry her off.</i>
At dawn the French embassy intervenes
Here you see Iadies and gentIemen,
the ambassador at the gates
of his paIace receiving the countess
In his capacity
as an officiaI representative
of the great nation's ideaIs,
he offers her his protection
For a whoIe day, for a whoIe night,
the ambassador protects her!
Now Iisten to the report
of that gaIIant dipIomat
<i>...for the woman, 1 2 perfect</i>/<i>ons.</i>
<i>It's LoIa that he created.</i>
<i>TweIve perfect th</i>/<i>ngs,</i>

He's not onIy the boss,
he is aIso doing a show in the first part
The cIown, you know
He's marveIous,
and during the intermission
he's counting the takings
This way
But, when I toId him that you were
the doctor, he agreed to see you
PIease, doctor, go in
I'm PauI MuIIer SchuIze SpuveIino
Excuse me
Sit down, doctor
So, what is this aII about?
- It's about Madame Montès
- Oh, yes, I know that
She came to visit you today
She has a IittIe sore throat
That's not unusuaI for her
but it's nothing
But I examined her
She has a weak heart
and the sore throat may indicate
something more serious
That woman is worn out before her time
She must be carefuI
Be carefuI? Have you seen the show?
Yes yesterday
It's insaneIy dangerous
- Yes
- EspeciaIIy the finaIe
She has to earn a Iiving
<i>Want</i>/<i>ng to make a name for herseIf,</i>
<i>LoIa understood</i>

The guests were deIighted,
and so were the fish
Are you aII right?
In Saint-Petersburg,
she was the toast of an entire regiment
and to prove his Iove,
the Czar decided
to serve his soIdiers champagne
from her sIipper
She achieved her aim
with a fresh scandaI
Every newspaper devoted
two pages excIusiveIy to her
At Ragusa
Chinese shadow show
DaImatian architecture
At Ragusa, exquisite dress,
she is denied entry to the church
Come, LoIa, come!
This is the actuaI dress
She becomes
more and more irresistibIe
In Budapest,
the strongest man in the worId,
the famous internationaI wrestIer
BuIgakov,
faIIs in Iove with her
She ignores him
So, he cannot sIeep,
he cannot eat, he cannot drink
He is defeated
and abandons his career
Ever since,
LoIa doesn't go anywhere
without BuIgakov
who has become her bodyguard
On his back, Iadies and gentIemen,
you can see
aII the most notorious scandaIs
LoIa wiII teII you herseIf
She wiII teII you the whoIe truth
Mammoth Circus owns

At that time, I was working in TivoIi
I was in Iove with
With? With whom LoIa? With?
The musicaI the musicaI conductor?
CIaudio Pirotto
I didn't know that he was married
That's his wife, on the 4th baIcony
on the Ieft, the big one
You'II see,
he won't get away with it
What is wrong with her? Is she mad?
Madam
A stooI
Madam, madam, don't go away
I have something to teII you
- But I don't know you
- Excuse me
He toId me he was divorced,
but this is not true
I don't appreciate married women much,
but I hate cowardIy men
Here, madam, by rights this beIongs
to you Anyway, it's probabIy junk
Next morning
Next morning thank you, LoIa
A cigar for the countess
It is interesting
that the countess is the first woman
in Europe to smoke cigars
Of course,
Iike most of the Cuban aristocracy,
she smokes EI CabaIIero Dorado
Which comes in 1 0 varieties
and is on saIe in this arena!
DeIightfuI!
Continue, LoIa
Next morning, I was the most famous
woman on the French Riviera
The internationaI eIite
wouId come and visit
Who, LoIa?
The? The great? French?
Aristocrats
The EngIish?
Bankers!
AII of high society
The Foreign Office does not get
as many visits from briIIiant dipIomats
as the smaII hoteI where LoIa stayed
And I, myseIf, Iadies and gentIemen,
didn't omit to pay my respects
Send him in
He is strange He frightens me
No one frightens me
I am a man of the circus
It is I who found
the three-headed woman for Barnum
and the onIy eIephant who can pIay
''Sur Ie pont d'Avignon'' on the piano
In New York,
we packed houses for weeks
with the two anarchists
who kiIIed the SuItan of Egypt
And in San Francisco,
five and a haIf weeks
Mere exampIes, but you'II get
a better picture of what we do
- What do you want?
- I want to book you
I was at the theater yesterday
- You Iiked my dancing?
- Not at aII You can't dance
But you know how to trigger a scandaI
Excite the audience
That's obvious, isn't it?
In the entire worId,
scandaI means money
And in America it has no Iimits
Come with me,
I'II get you top fees,
with Barnum, BuffaIo BiII, everywhere
The worId's most scandaIous woman
The most scandaIous act
You wiII reenact
your scandaIs you
You wiII even dance them if you must
And if there aren't enough to fiII
the biII, we'II invent some more
We'II show everything
that women dream of doing,
but Iack the courage to do
And stop pacing about Iike that
Stand stiII
TaIent doesn't interest me
AIIow me
OnIy power
and efficiency
The crowds run every night
to the theater not to see you dance
but to wait for you at the exit!
You are beautifuI
TerribIy beautifuI!
You seem to mean what you say
You smoke too much
NonetheIess, whatever you may think,
I'm not a machine for scandaI
I aIways do as I pIease That's aII!
That's what the eIephant thought too,
but in the end,
he Iearned to pIay the piano
Now he Ioves music
I'm not a fairground freak
I'm not interested in your offer
Very weII
But the offer stands
Here's the contract
I'II Ieave it to you
You know where to find me,
for better
or for worse
If you see me again,
it'II be for worse
So, don't hope for it
I don't hope for it
LoIa LoIa
Can I caII you LoIa?
After aII, we are feIIow professionaIs
Why not?
Why not?
Don't be fooIish, not Iike the others
Thus, Iadies and gentIemen,
LoIa Montès decIined our offer
and the countess of LandsfeId
embarked on her dizzying ascent,
presented here for the first time
in the worId
as an acrobatic and trapeze act
LoIa!
Just as every singIe action
in her Iife has been,
every singIe movement of her act
is fraught with danger
She risks her pretty neck!
One faIse movement
at these dizzy heights,
and she pIunges to her death
Paris!
Destiny sends her
from the famous journaIist Dujarrier
to the journaIist BeauvaIIon
whose newspaper has
a Iarger circuIation
The great and ceIebrated
Richard Wagner
The even greater and very famous
Frederic Chopin
faIIs on his knees for her
Higher, LoIa, higher
With dance and music,
LoIa rises from the worId of art
to that of poIitics
Ladies and gentIemen,
just one of the hazards
of our profession
The count of LichtenfeId,
harsh ruIer upon 7 8,000 souIs,
pays her 300 siIver ducats
per month
Higher, LoIa, higher!
The Grand Duke of Hesse
500 goIden ducats income per month!
Even higher, LoIa, even higher!
There!
LoIa reaches the summit
LoIa comes to power!
It's the most fantastic episode
of her story
LoIa in Bavaria
- I think we're Iost
- Perhaps
Maurice, stop
To Munich? To Munich?
Thank you
Are you sure?

I am a student

No, I'm going the other way
You can do that Iater come in
AII right, I'II show you the way
Drive on, Maurice,

Yes Go!
Latin, Greek, phiIosophy,
modern Ianguages and theoIogy
Very interesting
This is my fraternity cap AIIemania
A wonderfuI fraternity
I'm sure
And this is our scarf
It's red, green, bIack
Nice coIors!
Our badge
Our motto is:
''Learning, progress, faith''
Very nice
Oh, pardon me! Good morning, sir
Come here
Here?
Maurice!
Maurice?
Good night!
Wrap up weII
Oh! It's not worth it
Just five minutes
for a breath of fresh air
But wrap up anyway
Don't catch coId!
When I think that, at this very moment,
in Paris the chestnuts are in bIossom
What wouId you Iike, madam? PIease
Do you have a room?
AII the Iuggage is here?
PIenty of fresh air
Here, another room another room
Here connecting rooms
One couId be a music room
Thirty fIorins
- And how much upstairs?
- How much is it in French francs?
That's the best we have!
No, I mean, upstairs
Ah! On the second fIoor?
Even on the third
Of course
But that wouId be simpIer SimpIer
That's right
Another room on the second fIoor
Come this way, pIease Another room
Many more rooms
We have many more rooms! FoIIow me!
- Back aIready?
- I forgot something
- A nice view
- Yes five fIorins
WeII, we can put the piano there,
in that corner
And Josephine's bed here
With the IittIe nice curtains
Actress!
A Ietter from the RoyaI Theater
Thank you!
It's the answer to your Ietter
from Geneva
And?
Your audition is for tomorrow
In that case
I'II take the big apartment downstairs
<i>But treacherous schemes</i>
<i>prevent her from be</i>/<i>ng h</i>/<i>red.</i>
They know nothing about Spanish dances
here I think you were wonderfuI
WeII?
As aIways,
they didn't Iike the boIero
WiII you be getting in, madam?
No, go without me I'II waIk
AII right, madam Come on, you, get in!
I was aIways against this trip
We spent money
Move over!
- May I heIp you, madam?
- No one can heIp me, unfortunateIy
It's a pity
Here
Ferdinand von Freiberg
Of the king's regiment?
- You see the fIag over there?
- Yes
The first one under the cupoIa
I see
The bIack uniform with white pIumes
There, aII by himseIf, it's him
But, Ferdinand, you toId me
that you know him weII
that you were cIose to him
DarIing, I'm with him every day
But it takes more than six weeks
to present a dancer to the king
My hoteI biII is six weeks oId too
BeIieve me,
I'm working wonders of dipIomacy
Just yesterday
Count Senzheim assured me
- in about a month
- It's too Iong for me!
LoIa!
You attacked a Iieutenant
of the gendarmerie
- That's serious
- Yes, sire
I shouId have demoted him
and expeIIed you
Yes, sire
Instead, I've granted you an audience
and promoted him to captain
Yes, sire
You must excuse my indifferent French
Yes, sire Oh! Not at aII,
your French is very good!
Thank you
WeII, what do you wish to ask of me?
WeII, sire
You must speak up
because my hearing
sometimes faiIs me
Sire, I
Yes
It seems you have been given
Magnifying gIass an audition
An audition!
And you were turned down
And just what is an audition?
Perform on command?
Laugh, cry on command?
PIay, dance on command?
No one auditioned you to be a king
To be what?
To be a king
These committees, bureaucracies,
chanceIIors,
counseIors, they choke me!
ReaIIy!
AIways restraining, prohibiting
It's not in my nature
Your subjects must choke too,
with aII these Iaws, these reguIations
You can't aboIish
aII Iaws and reguIations
That's too bad
The report says,
''No cIassicaI training''
What is this cIassicaI training?
CIassicaI? CIassicaI?
The pirouettes? The ronds de jambe?
Dead and buried!
But the fandango, sire!
The boIero, the seguidiIIa!
These are
These Spanish dances, sire, are aIive!
Oh, pardon me, oh!
Go on, go on!
CIassicaI or not, they can't deny
I've got a good figure,
so they make up just anything
Ah, forgive me, forgive me
It is preciseIy on that point
that their report casts
How shaII I put it?
Their report casts doubts
What?! It's not true!
It is
They've got a nerve!
Am I expected to waIk around naked?
I, who dress so modestIy!
They're against me just
because I do have a good figure!
We'II settIe this right now
Bring a needIe and thread
Are you finished?
GIoves
handkerchief
handbag
AII these dance steps
It's very compIicated
No, it's quite cIear
I'm going to take a IittIe trip
When?
It's a reaI triumph
<i>It's me, Maur</i>/<i>ce.</i>
The manager!
It's the manager
His Majesty is asking for you
He's waiting in the royaI box
He's most enthusiastic
- My red scarf
- Wait, wait a minute!
Hurry! And my eyes!
Hurry up, madame!
- Is it aII right?
- Yes, yes! Fine, fine!
PIease mind the step
It's a IittIe bit narrow
They've been promising us
renovations for years Be carefuI!
This is the quickest way to the royaI box
His Majesty is waiting for you
- His Majesty!
- Your handkerchief! Your ring!
I was coming to see you, madam
Oh, no, that won't do
I wished to do you the courtesy
of coming to see you, madam
I must congratuIate you
Your invigorating presence
has accompIished a smaII revoIution!
And I must teII you
that you have won
Thank you
That you have won
your pIace in this theater
We aII hope that you'II stay
Thanks to you, Your Majesty,
I couId prove that I can dance
That's aII I wanted
I find your ambitions
a IittIe Iimited
- My work is done
- SureIy not!
Thanks to you,
I was initiated to a new art
I have watched you
at rehearsaIs discreetIy
I was very far, in the back, hidden,
and you, you Iooked so tiny
on that vast empty stage
I know aImost aII the steps by now
But I shaII have to study some more
Now, if I teII my aides, ''This is
an entrechat'', ''This is a chassé'',
they'II aIways answer, ''Yes, sire'',
even if I'm wrong
But with you, it's different
I wouId Iike
to discuss dancing with you
or even poIitics
You have such originaI ideas
Other topics too
We couId taIk
about ourseIves
Have you never thought of staying?
Of resting?
Of settIing down for a whiIe?
You are so IoneIy, sire!
That makes 42
with the affair in St Petersburg
Sir, you are exaggerating!
When such a woman spends
more than 5 minutes aIone with a man
that's enough to start rumors
Seven minutes!
I must congratuIate you on your discovery
She is quite remarkabIe!
Thank you, Your Majesty!
As I was saying, my dear friend,
I think we are doing
so much for the theater,
but too IittIe for the fine arts
Painting, for instance
Her Majesty the queen and I
were discussing it not Iong ago
and she totaIIy agrees with me
She wants a portrait by a master
for the NationaI GaIIery
A portrait of Her Majesty the queen,
it's a great idea
What?
A portrait of Her Majesty,
it's a IoveIy idea
Thank you, thank you, but don't hurry,
we have 20 aIready
We'II have the time to discuss it
when the queen returns
from her cure in Wiesbaden
No, I wouId Iike a portrait
of that dancer What's her name again?
- LoIa Montès, Majesty
- What?
- LoIa Montès
- Oh, yes, LoIa Montès
It's odd! I can never remember
that name A portrait of Miss Montès
Make sure she doesn't Ieave Munich
That's an order
Thank you It was wonderfuI
Sorry, I think I've thanked you aIready
- Where is my coach?
- Over there, Your Majesty
Summon any painters of taIent
to the Academy
Yes, Your Majesty
GentIemen, the king is coming
to choose a portrait painter
I warn you that the painting
must be done very quickIy
The modeI in question
wiII be Ieaving us shortIy
Put on your top hat!
Speak French and be quick
- Good morning
- Good morning
- How Iong?
- Seventeen days, Your Majesty
- Seventy-seven days?
- No, onIy 1 7
ActuaIIy, onIy 1 6 and a haIf days,
Your Majesty
- How Iong?
- Six weeks
- Six days?
- No, Your Majesty Six weeks
Oh thank you, thank you!
Very nice!
EIeven days, Your Majesty
OnIy seven days, Your Majesty!
Three months and ten days, I fear
- What?
- I'm sorry, Your Majesty
I started it in January
and the hoIidays deIayed my work
Then, we ceIebrated
a birth in the famiIy
How Iong?
- Three months and ten days
- You are the one!
Very nice
Now don't move Don't move
ExceIIent
- Do you Iike it?
- Oh, no
No, it's not quite right yet
- What is it?
- Too formaI
- Yes, of course! Too formaI!
- I find it stiff
Stiff, yes, too stiff WeII, that
Perhaps without the cIoak,
the portrait wouId Iook more naturaI
What are you whispering about?
Hush, hush!
Don't move, stay as you are!
How Iong to remove the cIoak?
Two months
Maybe two and a haIf months
three months
The painter takes his time
He doesn't Iike her dress
he doesn't Iike her gIoves
One day he asks her
if she dares pose for him
aII in pink
She dares!
And the king, enraptured by her pose,
offers her a paIace!
Rather grandiose!
- Oh! Now there'II be more troubIe
- Why?
WeII, I wanted to give it
to the NationaI Museum
But the Minister of Fine Arts objected
I wanted to put it
in the NationaI Library,
but the chanceIIor
of the university objected
He cIaims its educationaI vaIue
is not very high
I wanted to hang it
in the NationaI Theater,
but the director
and the archbishop protested
WeII, I don't know
what to do anymore
ReaIIy, I don't know
what to do anymore
Dismiss the Minister of Fine Arts
CIose the university
Suspend the manager,
forget the archbishop
and do as you Iike
It must go somewhere
I can't very weII keep it!
That's the fourth today
I can't hang it in my saIon either
It wouId Iook Iike advertising!
- Like what?
- Advertising
What?
Your hearing, you know
it can't go on Iike this
If Professor Jeppner's too oId
to visit you,
we'II visit him!
Oh! MarveIous!
What beautifuI ears!
Majestic ears! IndisputabIe ears!
May I have a Iight, pIease?
QuickIy, Anna,
a Iight for the Iady!
- Yes, yes!
- She's waiting
There there
I'm coming I'm coming
There's a Iight!
Thank you
Nothing serious, Your Majesty,
rest assured
Everything is wonderfuI! WonderfuI
Now, prepare yourseIf, Anna,
I wiII dictate my prescription
Yes
His Majesty wiII take 1 1 piIIs
upon retiring and onIy
five piIIs upon rising
The mentaI state is reaIIy
more important than the physicaI
The wiII to hear, that is the main thing
The wiII, isn't it, Your Majesty?
Yes There are things
I wouId Iike to hear again
Things that wouId be a pIeasure
to hear Music, for instance
Music Yes, but not Wagner
You couId hear him
from the bottom of a whaIe
I was thinking of Mozart
Oh, yes, Mozart,
he's aII tenderness and Iight
And then There's the voice
Madam's wonderfuI voice
Oh, I don't need to hear it
I read her Iips Don't I, my dear?
Yes, Your Majesty, but you
shouId aIso hear certain things
that concern you
Misfortune can strike so swiftIy,
Your Majesty
Yes, read this, Your Majesty, it's
the butcher who gave it to me
WeII There it is!
The entire town read it
It's a sort of of pamphIet
There are things I wish
neither to hear nor see
The woman is an insuIt to the nation!
An insuIt to dignity,
moraIity, reIigion
We demand that her titIes
and estate are rescinded
That the university is reopened!
That the ministers are reinstated
The king must expeI her
from Bavaria immediateIy
<i>HamIet.</i>
''O God! How weary''
No, thank you, not now
''O God!
How weary, staIe, fIat
and unprofitabIe
Seem to me aII the uses of this worId
Fie on't! O fie!
'Tis an unweeded garden
that grows to seed
Things rank and gross in nature
possess it mereIy
That it shouId come to this!''
Attention wandering?
I know I'm not
a professionaI actor but
But I'm doing my best!
Now where was I? Yes!
''That it shouId come to this!''
Can't one be Ieft in peace for once?
I'II go see
''O God! How weary''
I'II be back in a moment
- What's happening?
- It's nothing, madam
Oh or aImost nothing
Some students yes
some shopkeepers
professors and suchIike
a mob, you know
They're having
their IittIe revoIution
It's nothing These poor Bavarians
are far behind the times!
I don't think it's too aIarming
I don't know what's
the matter with them
A revoIution?
If they stop, it's a riot
If they continue, it's a revoIution
If they continue they'II spoiI
aII the fIowers in the greenhouses
Oh, my dear! I'm frightened
I'm frightened for you
Nothing wiII happen to you,
don't worry!
I'm not afraid for myseIf,
but for you
PIease Iisten!
You mustn't stay here, you mustn't!
If they're determined to make
a historic occasion,
they must find you in your pIace,
pIaying your part
- In my what?
- In your part as king!
With your books
your wife and your chiIdren
There is a time for everything,
even revoIutions!
Anyhow, on my next birthday, in March,
I wouId have been 62 years oId
I gather that aII this
is fairIy serious, isn't it?
Your Majesty, the carriage
is waiting for you behind the stabIes
Time is urgent
There are barricades
on the MaximiIianspIatz
It's a state of emergency
Your Majesty,
you must decide immediateIy
May I, at Ieast,
take Ieave of her first?
PIease hurry, Your Majesty
Every moment counts
unfortunateIy
Be quiet!
Josephine!
Don't be afraid, countess
You have nothing to fear from me,
from us
Watch aII the exits!
The main entrance
We want to save you
They wiII sureIy come for you
This revoIt
this revoIt is a work of reactionaries
You represent Iove, freedom,
everything they detest
They want to imprison you,
perhaps kiII you
But we are for Iove
and the pursuit of happiness
We want to heIp you
escape the country
We want to come with you
defend you
What have I to do with revoIutions,
whether they come
from the right or the Ieft?
Ours is of the Ieft
ReaIIy?
WeII, we'II cut
through the bIack forest
We'II change horses after you, won't we?
Oh! My red wine, where is it?
Josephine, you haven't forgotten
my red wine?
I hadn't time to get the chocoIates
What What is the matter with you?
Are you crying? Don't cry
There's aIways a revoIution somewhere!
Now it's their turn
Come on, hurry!
Don't worry With the stagecoach,
you'II be in Paris before us
You're safe
You're not a known personaIity
- Give me aII your money
- What?
WeII, aImost aII
When you reach Strasbourg,
go to bed earIy
Don't hang around aII night
Oh, yes, I know you
Good-bye
Don't cry
Good Iuck, madam
We may not meet again
Don't fret we'II meet again
Good-bye, madam
She's saved the RoyaI House
She's saved Bavaria
from a dreadfuI civiI war, at any rate
Best of aII, she saved herseIf
with a young man who's bareIy 20
AII's weII so far, thank God!
Don't be afraid We'II fight for you
I hope it won't come to that
AIas! Nothing ever happens here
Out with that gypsy!
Say something!
First of aII,
you didn't bring any Iuggage
Nothing to spend the night
Anyway, you're much too young
for aII this
No, no, no, no! Don't say that
At 20, I'm not too young
- You are
- No, Iet me expIain
It's not true
I know one thing
I'm not oId but the king was oId
and you see how that ended
Moreover, you didn't Iove him
Whereas you?
You can't heIp but Iove me
I'm young enough to offer you
a new start a a new Iife
I wouId fear nothing,
no obstacIes, no confIicts
There wouId be no more fame,
no more fortune, of course
What I have to offer is something eIse
A simpIe Iife, Iove in a new Iand
You might be happy
as just another woman
With chiIdren
- Why not?
- Let's do it!
We're reaching the border
I'II pass my finaI exams
I'II soon be teaching Latin
Latin is wonderfuI
It's aIways in demand
Not in everyday Iife, of course,
but we'd have
our choice of universities
Listen to me
There is such a thing as coincidence
I'm the first man you met in Bavaria
and the Iast
Do you remember?
You had invited me, I answered,
''I'm going the other way''
''You'II do that Iater'', you said
And here, I am again with you
We've set out together
It's fate
It was written
It's destiny
One mustn't fight destiny!
Or mistake one's destiny
- But
- Listen to me
I've kept quiet
and Iet you have your say
You said it weII,
so don't bIame yourseIf
It's not because you're 20,
don't think that
Then what is it?
First of aII, you're wrong,
I did Iove your king, very much
That surprises you?
Someday you'II Iearn that peopIe
can keep hoping for miracIes
That's when you'II find happiness
Don't be sad
Listen to me, try to understand
I've Iived too much,
had too many adventures
Bavaria was my Iast chance
My Iast hope of a haven
It's aII over aII over
You see,
if this warmth you offer me,
if this face
which I find not unpIeasing
Ieaves me without hope,
then something is broken
Yes, it's over
She was aIone again
So it was, Iadies and gentIemen,
that the countess of LandsfeId,
reIinquishing power and gIory,
remembered our offer
and took the incredibIe Ieap
over the ocean
She Ianded in the middIe of your Iife,
among her reaI friends
Is she to jump?
Tonight? Of course, as every night
Haven't you noticed
a certain Ioss of agiIity IateIy?
I mean, has she ever nearIy missed?
No
She has managed very weII,
every night, for four months now
Then wiII you?
This is the reaI reason I'm here
WiII you Ieave
the safety net there tonight?
PIease do as I ask
Eddy
TeII the ringmaster
to Ieave the net tonight
- Yes, sir
- Hurry
The sensationaI dive
you are about to see
is aII the more dangerous since LoIa
performs without a safety net
- What's going on?
- I don't know
or I caII the poIice!
Ladies and gentIemen,
unforeseen circumstances
I have just been informed
that the management,
for reasons concerning the heaIth
of the countess of LandsfeId,
wishes to take
every possibIe precaution
I am forbidden to remove the net
Bobby!
But kindIy remain seated,
Iadies and gentIemen!
A whiskey!
- Give me the money
- No, I'II pay you Iater
I now ask you,
LoIa Montès,
whether you wiII accept the net
Yes or no?
Say yes, or you'II end up
breaking your neck
After the jump, gentIemen,
and now I address the gentIemen onIy,
being sure of the countess' answer,
after the jump, the countess wiII bestow
a particuIar favor on you
A remarkabIe favor
whose generosity and piquancy
you wiII appreciate
GentIemen above the age of 1 6
wiII be abIe to approach her
She wiII be in our menagerie,
among the wiId beasts
You wiII be abIe to approach her,
touch her, kiss her hand!
Kings, princes, miIIionaires
have sacrificed aII for that:
Their countries, their power,
their miIIions
- It's 50 cents
- I don't care
- But I paid for it You owe me, sir!
- Go away, go away!
But for you, gentIemen,
there's no question of miIIions
It won't cost a hundred thousand
Not a thousand or hundred doIIars!
Not ten doIIars
Just one doIIar!
Think of it, gentIemen, one doIIar!
The countess has decided,
Iadies and gentIemen
Remove the net
I was terrified, you know
I couIdn't Iive without you
- Thank you
- I'II be aII right
Treat yourseIf to a good time,
gentIemen
Come and see LoIa!
OnIy one doIIar!
Mind your cigar, sir!
RoII up, gentIemen!
An unforgettabIe souvenir for a doIIar!
Step right up!
OnIy one doIIar
It's next to nothing
You won't regret your money, gentIemen!
