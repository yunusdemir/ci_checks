What is it you're drawing, Celestine?
A bear.
And what's this?
It's a mouse. They're friends.
Um, you're wrong there.
- Am not!
- Are so!
- No!
- Yes!
A mouse and a bear?
It's just not possible!
Good. So, which story
should I tell you tonight?
The one about the big evil bear?
Yes, the big evil bear!
In winter, the big evil bear sleeps.
And, when he wakes up...
When he wakes up, he's hungry!
Exactly! And when he's hungry...
He'll eat anything?
Absolutely anything!
Tires! Melons! Lamps! Cars! Houses!
And when he's hungry, he drinks...
Um, I mean eats, absolutely anything!
And, what is the big evil
bear's favourite food?
A little mouse?
A little mouse? One little mouse?
Ten!
A hundred!
Thousands of little mice!
Wrapped. On bread.
In a pan.
Boiled.
Even raw!
Completely raw?
Most of all, completely raw!
And still living, with a little
coat and a backpack still on,
this is what he likes the most.
Completely raw.
And still breathing.
But, but, are you sure
that he is this evil?
Do you know the story of
a little mouse who didn't
believe in the stories
about the big evil bear?
"Everyone told her beware of the bear!"
But would she listen?
That little... that stupid little...
Cretin! Oh, pardon me...
That, that... that dirty little...
that naughty child!
She didn't believe that bears are evil,
she said things like:
Oh, the big evil bear,
it's just a story that the gray told us
while drinking her eternal cup of tea.
But she was wrong!
Because one day, a beautiful d...
Did you draw this, Celestine?
Believe me, children,
it's only in fairytales that the
bears are friends with mice!

{\an2}What is she saying?
{\an3}I have no idea.
{\an1}What did you say?
{\an3}I said I don't know.
{\an2}I'm trying to
listen here!
{\an3}It's not like you can
understand her!
{\an1}Of course I can!
No you can't!
{\an1}Oh, I can't?
You're nothing but a big fat liar!
{\an1}Repeat that!
Silence!
Come here, little birdie...
Nice little birdy...
Come back, you nasty
little creature! Come back!
"The King of Candy"
Celestine!
Is it clear?
Wait...
Let's go.
Oh, look, he's lost his first tooth.
Poor darling.
And not a trace of decay.
It's like a pearl.
Don't cry, sweetie!
Everything's going to be okay.
I'll put the tooth on your nightstand,
and the tooth fairy will come.
The tooth fairy? What tooth fairy?
The nice little mouse tooth fairy.
She comes when you're asleep,
and replaces your old tooth
with a shiny new coin.
Well what kind of coin is it?
A huge coin! Your first! The
beginning of your great fortune.
Assuming you make all the
proper investments, of course
But... I've never heard of
this mouse tooth fairy before.
It's because you've never
lost a tooth before!
That's ridiculous!
There's no such thing as a fairy
mouse, so it can't be real.
Oh no? Why do the teeth
dissappear from nightstands then?
Well, uh...
Sweetie, I have an idea.
Why don't you go to sleep now,
and when you wake up,
there will be a shiny
new coin right there.
How much will she give me?
Um... a quarter?
Two.
Well done! That's my boy.
Come on, darling, now go to bed.
A mouse!
A mouse? Where?
There, by the toys!
Wait until I get
my hands on you!
It's under here, George!
- Where is it?
- Over there!
Come out of there!
Come back here, you beast!
Hey! My tooth!
That's my money! Give it back!
You dirty little...
Keep it down, George.
Leon is sleeping.
George! The trash!
Ernest, Ernest, my name is Ernest,
I sing on the street,
for something to eat.
No bread in my tummy,
no soup in my bowl,
please bring me a cow
and I'll swallow it whole,
I've nary a bite,
for many a night,
I've lost so much weight,
that I can't get a date.
My pants are so loose,
I could eat a moose,
so please wont you share,
with your fellow bear?
Ernest, Ernest,
my name is Ernest.
I'd like a roll,
can you give me some dough?
I don't need a whole baguette,
just one slice or two,
how does that sound to you?
And do you have any cheese?
Ernest, Ernest,
my name is Ernest.
Ernest loves mommies
and children the best,
They're brimming with goodness,
much more than the rest.
Would it be so awful to
share some of that waffle?
So warm and so sweet
It would be such a treat,
Just one little bite!
Ask your mom, it's alright!
Honey, no!
A morsel to spare,
for this pitiful bear,
Is there nobody there,
to answer my prayer?
A sausage, a steak,
a chocolate souffle,
some fancy fondue,
and I'll bid you adieu!
You have five days to pay the fine.
I'm hungry!
No!
Don't eat me!
But I'm hungry.
What's your name?
Ernest.
I'm Celestine.
We need to talk about this, Ernest!
You can't eat me.
Bears only eat mice in fairy tales.
You don't still believe in fairy tales,
do you, Ernest?
- But I'm hungry!
- You're hungry, you're hungry...
Do you really think a little
mouse like me will fill you up?
Look at me, Ernest,
I'm nothing but skin and bones.
Hasn't anyone ever told you that
the garbage is full of diseases!?
The flu, typhoid, hepatitis, cholera!
Ernest! Do you want to catch
every disease in existence?
Well... no, Celestine, but...
Let's see.
Nose is wet, glassy eyes,
matted fur...
Are your ears sore?
And teeth?
Oh my... not good.
What? Am I sick?
Not yet, but soon.
Listen.
I can show you a place that's filled
with delicious treats for a bear to eat.
Like marshmallows?
Marshmallows, pinwheels, nougats,
caramels, chocolate, gummy bears...
okay?
Okay!
In there!
You won't be hungry after this, Ernest.
No, wait!
There you go. Bon ap√©tit!
Celestine!
Thank you!
You're welcome.
Out of the way!
Dental floss, here!
By the foot, or by the yard!
And one and two,
and one and two...
C'mon, put your back
into it, rookie!
Cheese fondue, nice and hot!
Come have a taste!
There you go, ma'am,
don't burn your whiskers.
Watch where you're going, young lady!
Sorry, madam, I'm in a hurry!
It's not open yet.
They told us to wait here.
You stink of garbage.
Hurry up, or the big
evil bear will get you!
So, how many teeth did you collect?
Seven.
Is that all? I got twelve.
Twelve?
I usualy find more,
it's way below my best score.
What about you, Celestine?
How many did you find?
Well...
Please wait there.
Relax, it's a lot easier if
you're not so tense.
This could hurt quite a bit...
Step forward.
Here you go, madam, twelve teeth.
Very good.
I can do even better, you know.
Yes, yes... next!
Seven? That's it?
Yes, but three are incisors.
And look at the quality.
Incisors? I'll take one.
This one here is too short.
Thank you!
We'll try this one...
Repeat after me:
The big bad bear is our biggest burden.
Wa wig wed wear if far wiweft wurden.
Not quite there.
And now?
Wa fig fet fear iw of biweft buften.
Allow me, please.
Now then, one more time.
The wig wad wear...
Stop!
Again, please.
The big bad bear is our biggest burden.
There we go. It's all in the wrist.
- In the wrist.
- What!?
Only one tooth!
One single tooth in the whole night?
But I was stuck
in a garbage can.
Yeah? And how did you get out?
Actually, a bear...
A what?
No, no, nothing...
Then you won't mind if
I look inside your bag?
Well, we can see how you
spend your internship, Celestine.
Drawing pictures,
instead of gathering teeth?
You will never become a dentist
if you continue like this.
But, but, I don't want to be a dentist...
Oh, I see what's going on here.
You're behind 50 teeth, Celestine,
and you don't think you
can possibly catch up.
But all you need is a
little bit of motivation.
Come with me.
Look here, Celestine.
You and I are rodents,
we are not bears.
Our strength is not
in our body mass,
our muscles, our claws,
our ridiculously large jaws.
No!
We are far more delicate creatures.
Elegant, refined.
Look at our entire civilization.
Think of our achievements
over the centuries.
To what do we owe them all?
Well, what?
Speak up, my little one.
- Our incisors...
- Speak up!
- To our incisors.
- That's right!
They are the foundation
of our society.
Thanks to them,
we have built the greatest cities...
gnawed our way through
the hardest stone...
constructed the most complex machines...
and we have rerouted the
largest rivers in the world!
And all thanks to our adorable,
our precious, our invaluable,
our delicate and yet perfectly
precise cutting tools, our incisors.
But, what happens, Celestine,
if a mouse loses one of their incisors?
He dies.
In agonizing and unbearable pain.
He can no longer eat, or speak.
He dies. Tormented by hunger.
Let's review again from the top.
What kind of tooth is the best
replacement for a mouse's tooth?
- A bear's tooth?
- Indeed!
Bears have the hardest,
and most durable teeth.
And the easiest
bear teeth to find,
are the ones that bear cubs
place under their pillows.
So, Celestine...
You're going back up there.
And get as many teeth as
possible from those morons.
Okay?
I do not want to see your whiskers
back down here, Celestine,
until you have collected no less
than 50 teeth! Is that clear?
Fifty teeth, Celestine!
Fifty teeth...
Good luck, Celestine!
Are you coming?
Yeah! I'm coming! I'm coming!
Welcome! Welcome children!
You hungry?
Yes!
Can I have one
cream puff, please?
Of course,
I've got one right here!
Bag of lemon drops, sir.
Okay! Here's your lemon drops.
Five lollipops, and some marshmallows.
Yes, very good choice!
Here you go.
Right, there you are!
Who's next?
- Some candy canes, please.
- There. Thank you very much.
Strawberry ice cream please, Papa.
One ice cream coming up!
Wait a minute!
Over here...
I've already warned you.
You are not to have
any sweets! Not ever!
But Papa...
Don't Papa me!
You are not allowed to eat even
the smallest piece of sugar!
Do you want your teeth to
rot right out of your mouth?
Do you want to end up at
your mother's shop, huh!?
Is that what you want?!
Go on home right now.
We'll talk about this in the evening.
Ah, Mister Schubert,
it's so good to see you!
How are you doing today?
Fine, just fine.
I need a tooth, so I'll be
able to eat nougat again.
Oh, I see...
Now what were you thinking?
An incisor... or perhaps a canine?
No, I need a pre-molar.
Let me see, let me see...
Aha! Here we are!
I have the exact model you need.
It's a pre-molar of premium quality.
Try it out!
It's perfect. I'll take it!
Thank you, madam.
There you go, buddy.
And what about you, sweetie?
What can I get you?
Candy canes?
Cotton candy?
How about some jelly beans?
I just want marshmallows.
Marshmallows? Why, of course...
Oh, I've just run out.
No, no, no!
Don't cry, little one!
I have more downstairs.
Don't move.
I'll be back in just one second.
What are you doing in here?
Thief! Thief!
Watch out!
You're breaking everything!
Oh no you don't!
I'm calling the police!
- Police!
- Ernest?
- My marshmallows!
- My marshmallows!
Police! Police!
Over here! He eaten all my candy!
Here! Look! This is him, you see?
Okay, what's going on here?
Wait, Ernest?
This morning you were panhandling,
and now you're robbing candy stores?
How did you even get in there?
There was this little mouse,
and she... uh... oh...
A little what?
I just got a bit hungry, okay!
Okay, come on.
Hey those are mine!
Give me my marshmallows!
Stealing from honest working folk.
No respect.
Ernest, it's me. Do you need help?
Do you want me to set you free, Ernest?
If I set you free...
will you do me a little favor?
What about a big favor, Ernest.
If I set you free, will you do it?
It's a really huge favor, Ernest.
Will you still do it for me?
The biggest favor in the world?
Yes, Celestine!
The biggest favor in the world.
Would you like more peas, sweetheart?
I'd rather have candy.
Come on, Leon, don't start this again.
We've told you a thousand times,
you are not allowed to eat any candy,
- and that's final.
- But how come?
Well, that's simple.
It's supply and demand.
Papa rots people's teeth
on one side of the street...
And mommy replaces
them on the other side.
And one day,
both businesses will be yours.
Which means you are
going to be doubly rich.
So long as you keep smiling
at the customers, of course.
And as your grandfather
used to say,
"To have a beautiful smile
you must have healthy teeth."
Listen carefully, Leon...
To make money, we need
to rot other people's teeth.
But not yours.
Do you understand?
Yeah.
Good.
There's a lot to do tomorow,
so let's go to sleep.
I have to replace all of my stock...
At least we don't have to worry about
anything like that happening at my store...
I mean, who would ever
want to steal teeth?
Over here, Ernest. Hurry up!
This is it. Right here.
Okay.
Stop it! You're making too much noise!
Stop! You'll wake up the
whole neighbourhood!
There we go.
Ernest! Wait!
Alright, so where are the teeth?
They're probably stored
in a safe somewhere.
Like that thing over there?
Yes, that's it.
I'll go and pick the lock.
No need to. I can handle it.
Handle it? But what are you...
No! Ernest! No!
That's not how you're
supposed to do it!
- I got it.
- What is wrong with you?
What? You wanted it open, right?
Hey, wait! Aren't you gonna
help me carry this?
Oh, no. I'm too tired!
You promised me, remember?
One last thing and then
we're even, right?
We're even.
Wait here, I'll check if the
coast is clear. Got it.
Okay it's clear...
Ernest, wait!
Bears are heavy sleepers.
Especially in the winter time.
Celestine!?
I thought I told you to not
to come back here until...
Celestine...
I... look at this!
Look at... I can't, this is...
This is fabulous, just look at this!
How did you manage to...
Bravo, Celestine!
I am so proud of you!
Hooray for Celestine!
Celestine! Celestine!
Celestine! Celestine!
It's...
it's the Big Bad Bear!
Ernest?
Celestine, you know him!?
And did you bring him here?
It's her! I warned her,
but she refused to believe.
Everyone told her,
"Beware of the Big..."
Celestine, I uh..
This way, Ernest!
C'mon, Ernest, we have to jump!
There! He's over there!
No Ernest, that way!
Excuse me, excuse me!
Ernest, we can get out through
the tunnel over there.
Go left, look, there!
Look!
It's terrible! I'm sure
that I'd locked the door...
A mouse!
In my husband's truck!
Ernest?
What are you doing, Ernest?
Why did you steal the truck? Are you mad?
What were you thinking, Ernest?
Why did you stay down there? Are you crazy?
- Hey, I dozed off. It's not my fault.
- So it's my fault?
Yes, you made me climb down with you!
I couldn't carry the bag by myself!
- You told me you'd show me the exit!
- But you told me you remebered where it was!
I said that?
Ernest! Pull over! You can't escape!
Ram him!
Now pull over to the curb!
Okay! If you insist.
We're not gonna let go, Ernest!
Just watch out for the lamp post, then.
Ernest, turn yourself in,
we're not giving up!
Well, this is my turn. See ya!
"NATIONAL POLICE
United we fight!"
End of the line.
So long, Celestine.
- What do you mean, "So long, Celestine?"
- I mean, I'm home.
Well, what about me?
You? I have no idea. This is my home,
I guess you go back to yours.
But... Ernest, I don't have a home!
You saw, they chased me out.
Celestine, we made a deal.
You said it yourself, you set me free,
and in exchange I do you the
biggest favor in the world.
- Please, Ernest...
- So there. Now we're even.
What? Even? But it doesn't count.
Things have changed, Ernest!
Sorry, no mice in the house.
Ernest, will you just listen to me?
I already told you!
No mice inside the house, ever!
You let one in, you get a thousand.
That's what you all are like.
Just ask any bear.
Now scram!
But, Ernest...
I said no mice allowed
inside the house.
Out!
But Ernest, you have to understand
things are different now.
No mice inside the house!
- But...
- No buts!
Ernest!
- I said no!
- I'm hungry!
No...
mice...
in the house!
And stay out!
Thank you.
Celestine, I told you...!
You know you can't get rid of a mouse,
Ernest, any bear will tell you that!
If you don't kill them, that is.
Your chocolate's burning, Ernest.
Do you want to kill me, Ernest?
You can forget about the broom,
I'm too quick for that.
I suppose you can try the mouse trap...
but we all know that one.
It's the oldest trick in the book.
So, I doubt I would fall for that, either.
That leaves... rat poison, or glue traps.
Those glue traps are terrible!
The poor little mouse walks
on it and gets stuck on it.
She is very scared, and her heart beats
so fast that it eventualy explodes.
Is that what you want, Ernest?
For my heart to explode?
Well no, Celestine, but it's just that a
mouse and a bear, it seems so... you know...
So what? Improper? Is that it?
Mice should live below and
the bears above, is that it?
Well, yeah... It's always
been that way, you know?
Alright, Ernest. Do you have a cellar?
Yeah, but why...
Okay, I'll go down there...
and you stay up here!
But...
No buts! Good night, Ernest.
And you better stay upstairs.
And you stay downstairs, Celestine!
I don't want to hear you,
let alone see you!
My chocolate!
There she is!
The one who refused to
believe in the Big Bad Bear!
Everyone told her,
"You must beware of the Big Bad Bear!"
Wake up. It's okay, Celestine.
Don't be afraid.
Celestine, I'm not your nightmare.
It's me, Ernest.
Ernest, I'm worthless.
Calm down, calm down.
Wanna tell me what's bothering you?
I have nothing!
I'm all alone in the world.
Nobody loves me and
I don't have a home.
Oh yeah? Well what about me?
Does anyone love me?
Did you draw this, Celestine?
It looks wonderful!
It looks exactly like me!
Celestine, who painted
this, is not worthless!
Take it from me,
you are a great artist.
But that's it! That's why I'm alone.
They don't like my drawings.
They want me to be a dentist.
Oh yes...
It was the same with me.
I wanted to be in theater,
to play music, to perform on the stage.
But no, they wanted me
to become a judge.
Like my father, and my grandfather,
and my uncle, and my great uncle...
"Stop playing your music, Ernest!"
"Ernest, quit pestering
us with your stories!"
"Stop singing, Ernest. You should
be studying your law books."
My turn!
"No, Celestine!"
"You have to stay downstairs!"
"I don't want to hear you,
let alone see you!"
There, much better!
I have an idea...
Grab all you drawing stuff,
and follow me.
We're going to make you
a studio, Celestine.
A proper artist's studio.
This will be my first real painting.
So, what are you going to paint?
The Big Bad Bear, of course!
There.
Raise your arms!
Like this.
There you go.
Lift up your leg.
Perfect.
Now don't move, Ernest.
And keep looking ferocious.
- Can I see it?
- I said don't move!
Ernest?
Are you okay?
It's just a little cold.
Into bed, right now!
Lots of water, Ernest.
When you have a fever,
you need lots of water.
Stop, what are you doing!?
- Ernest, calm down.
- Leave me alone! Help!
I'm not your nightmare.
It's me, Celestine.
Are there any marshmallows left?
Of course.
Don't eat them all, okay?
Of course I won't.
Do you promise?
Cross my heart.
- Good night, Ernest.
- Good night...
Hey Celestine!
Guess what? I'm all better!
Yep, take a look at this!
Ta-da!
Bet you can't do it with four!
You wanna bet?
Let's do it again, Ernest!
Come on!
The chief of police confirmed
that warrants have
been issued for the arrest
of the two burglars...
Are we the burglars?
The arrest is imminent,
and authorities expect
to have them in custody
in a matter of days.
No, I'm sure they've
forgotten all about us.
We will not rest until we apprehend
Ernest and his accomplice, Celestine.
The department has already formed search
parties to force them out of hiding...
However long it takes, months if necessary,
they will be located and captured!
We cannot sit by and allow
their actions to go unpunished.
They will be prosecuted to
the fullest extent of the law.
Ernest will receive no mercy.
Celestine will be severely punished.
The authorities are moving swiftly,
to bring these two criminals to justice.
The crimes of Celestine strike at
the very heart of our society!
Ernest will receive the maximum penalty.
Neither Ernest nor Celestine
will escape their sentence!
Did you call me, Ernest?
No, Celestine. Everything is just fine.
Yeah. Just fine.
You've made so much progress, Celestine.
Yes, but I've had enough
of painting big evil bears.
Really?
Well, can't you think of
something more interesting?
I wanna go and paint the outside.
You're gonna have to wait 'til spring.
Us bears know all about that,
waiting until spring.
But all the snow will be gone.
Celestine wants to paint the snow...
Celestine wants to paint the snow...
Okay artist, go to work!
Thank you, Ernest.
Ernest, I present to you... "winter"!
If it was a song, it would
sound just like this.
Celestine...
Ernest, the van!
What about the van?
It's like a big red target!
They'll know that we're here...
There's only one thing to do, Celestine.
Ernest, did you see the fish?
Yeah, yeah... I did.
Don't you want to take a closer look?
No, no, I can see them from here.
Celestine, we're going back, come.
The search remains active.
The authorities have vowed not
to rest, until Ernest and
his accomplice Celestine are
safely in police custody.
{\an1}Yes. It's true.
If there is anyone out there,
who thinks they may have...
Don't worry, Celestine.
They're never going to find us.
The police are still looking for the two
suspects, Ernest and Celestine...
No leads are too small,
all leads will be investigated.
- What was that?
- Was it the fairy mouse?
George, go see what happened.
My van! My Store!
Is this paint?
Ernest!
Lucienne! Lucienne! Call the police!
I know where Ernest is!
Celestine...
Good morning! Look how sunny it is!
Oh no, is the Big Bad Bear grumpy?
Does the Big Bad Bear
not want to wake up?
Is the Big Bad Bear gonna eat me?
Good idea. Then I could sleep.
Then I better give the Big Bad
Bear a nice big breakfast...
That way I can live
to see another day.
That's pretty tasty.
How can you possibly sleep
in on such a sunny day?
Ernest, come look!
Go to the basement, Ernest!
You have to hide there!
But wait, Celestine.
You have to hide as well!
Don't worry, I have a plan.
A plan?
Celestine, are you sure about this?
Stay down there!
Celestine...
He's in here! Go!
Where is Ernest?
Uncle Ernest? Uh...
He went to town, to buy some honey.
He'll be back tomorrow.
For the last time, Celestine...
Where is Ernest?
Very well. You had your chance.
For the last time, Ernest,
where is Celestine?
Alright! But don't say
I didn't warn you!
Heave ho! Heave ho!
Now release!
Read all about the trial
of the terrible Ernest,
right here, in the Mouse Weekly!
The shocking scandal of Ernest,
and his accomplice Celestine.
Hey look! That's him! Over there!
All rise for our honorable judge.
You may bring in the accused.
Will the accused please stand,
and state your name?
Celestine.
Celestine.
Will you please tell us
where to find Ernest?
For the last time, tell us
where to find Celestine!
Very well! Then I shall be
forced to charge you twice.
First, for all of your crimes,
And second, for her crimes.
Celestine! What has
she done wrong?
- She's done nothing!
- Nothing?
Nothing!? She brought a
ferocious bear into our midst.
Is that what you call nothing?
What was he supposed to do?
Die of hunger while the rich fat
bears have everything they want?
Do you know how heavy
a bag full of teeth is?
I had to carry it for her!
{\an3}Silence!
You wanted her to be a dentist, not me!
{\an3}Silence!
I said that's enough!
Ernest, you and your
accomplice Celestine,
have been accused of the following
list of heinous crimes:
breaking and entering a business,
grand robbery, theft of a car,
evading of arrest,
destruction of public property.
To which, there are witnesses!
A countless number of witnesses!
But what is worst of all, Ernest,
you have been accused
of a most despicable crime...
You were scaring the children!
What? Children, do I frighten you?
Me? I frighten mothers?
Madame, do I frighten you?
Well, no.., uh, um...
A mouse! There! A mouse!
And now, we will hear from...
And now, the defense will
present their case.
Ladies and gentlemice of
the jury, your honor...
What is my client being accused of?!
Being a bear ifs ifs fa fefifbe pfifn...
- What's he saying?
- I don't know.
- What was that?
- I don't know!
Will you please keep it down?
You understand what he's saying?
- Perfectly.
- Liar! You cannot.
Order in the court! Silence! Calm down!
Celestine,
in light of the accusations...
That's enough!
All I'm guilty of is being
friends with a bear.
And that's not a crime, is it?
How dare you!
All of you are just being prejudiced!
Yes, Celestine is my friend!
That's what you accuse me of?
For being friends with a mouse?
"Bears above and mice below,"
is that it?
Is that really what you
want to teach your kids?
To be afraid of a tiny little mouse?
You want them to be dumb or something?
Silence, Celestine!
You're the accused, not the lawyer.
You will come to order or
I will clear the room!
Clear the room!
The trial is not over!
Come back here!
Celestine, let me be absolutely clear!
Nobody questions the
foundations of our society.
Least of all a mouse!
But Your Honor,
if you would just listen...
Silence!
Sit back down!
Wait, what are you doing?
He needs help.
I'm sure he'll be alright,
let's get out of here!
You stay back! I want you back
in your box where you belong!
That is an order!
But Your Honor, you're on fire!
That is enough! Take your seat!
Don't make me say it again!
Get down from there.
Get down from there this instant!
I will not tolerate this behavior!
Let go of me!
I said unhand me!
Let go of me!
Your Honor!
Come on, quick, let's go!
We have to leave!
Let go of me!
Have you lost your mind?
Where is everyone?
Everybody left, and we should, too.
They abandoned me.
But not you...
We have to go now, come on.
Tell me, Celestine, if we
get out of here alive...
What do you want most in the world?
To find Ernest, and to stay
with him forever.
Alright.
But you know, Celestine, it's funny
that you'd want to live with a bear...
But why?
You live with a bear, don't you?
Yes, I do.
That's right, it's a funny thing.
Are you okay, Your Honor?
What just happened?
You caught on fire, Your Honor.
Ernest, you saved my life.
How can I repay you?
- Well, it was nothing.
- It was NOT nothing!
Now tell me, what do you
want most in the world?
- You mean now?
- Of course I mean now!
To find Celestine,
and stay with her forever.
You are free to go.
She saved my life.
Celestine!
- Celestine!
- Ernest!
Ernest!
No, Ernest.
- We can.
- No.
Yes, we can.
No, I'm telling you that it's impossible.
And I'm saying that it isn't.
But think about it.
We can't tell our story, it's terrible.
To start, you found me in a garbage can,
and then you tried to eat me.
- That's funny!
- No, I don't want to tell this.
No, I don't want to tell this.
But we could change some things...
Imagine...
imagine you were a little baby,
left alone in the trash.
an abandoned baby,
your eyes were not opened yet.
 Draw this! Draw it!
I was a garbage man, and
was sweeping the pavement,
and I suddenly heard a
noise coming from the bin.
Was it me?
Yes, it was you.
And what did you do next?
Well, a bit like in reality,
I lifted you from the trash,
and I slipped you into my coat pocket.
And then I brought you home.
And then?
Well, after that I took care of you and
decided to keep you as my own.
I made you a little bed, next to mine.
And we started to live together as a family.
And that is the story of how we met.
And after this, will there be
other stories, Ernest?
A lot of them, Celestine, a lot of them.
