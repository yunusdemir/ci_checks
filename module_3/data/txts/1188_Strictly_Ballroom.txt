Come on, 100!
Scott won most of the trophies
in this room.
You see, that's the tragedy.
My son was a champion.
Welcome to the Southern District's
Waratah Championships!
You're gonna see some of the top dancers
in the Southern District here today.
There'd been some silliness in the past,
but we thought he was over it.
We never imagined
he'd do such a thing in front of...
Federation President, Barry Fife!
And don't forget
the official Federation video...
Wonderful to see you, Barry.
Barry Fife's 'Dance To Win'
is on sale here tonight!
Yeah!
There was no doubt that Scott and Liz
would be the next...
..Pan Pacific Grand Prix
Latin American Champions.
I mean, they'd worked towards it
all their lives!
And then... came that...
Samba!
Come on, 54!
Come on, 69!
Ken Railings and Pam Short
were dancing that night.
Come on, 69!
Ken's a wonderful ambassador
for ballroom dancing.
But I know that everyone there
really thought it was Scott's turn.
Come on, No.100!
Come on, No.100!
It is true. Scott and Liz became
what we term "boxed in", or blocked.
Piss off!
It was no excuse for what Scott did.
What the hell's going on, Kendall?
He resorted to his own flashy
crowd-pleasing steps.
Come on, come on...
He forced me. Where the man goes
the lady must follow. I had no choice!
I bet she never saw that before!
I keep asking myself why.
Did I do something wrong?
Did I fail him as a mother?
In front of Barry Fife!
- I'll cut the music.
- Don't be bloody stupid!
Yes!
To pick what was actually wrong
with the steps...
..you'd have to be an experienced
professional. Like myself.
Or Federation President Barry Fife.
Barry Fife...
Well, of course, you can dance
any steps you like.
That doesn't mean you'll...
..win.
The winner is couple No.69,...
..Ken Railings and Pam Short!
Ken and Pam are Southern Star
New Vogue titleholders,...
..Putting on the Ritz City and Country
Three Dance Round Robin Champions,...
..Tulip Time Central Districts
Champions,...
..and former three times Pan Pacific
Grand Prix Amateur Five Dance...
..Latin American Champions!
Yes!
I've only been dancing for two years,
so I haven't got a partner yet.
But I thought they were wonderful.
I thought they should've won.
Hi, Liz, I thought you should've won!
All the way from the big smoke...
- Liz!
- Piss off!
Liz...
Get away from me!
I'm not dancing with you!
Not till you dance like you're supposed to!
One, two, three, four...
Partner up!
Happy as Larry, they were, last night.
On the phone for hours!
I'm just asking
what did you think of the steps?
I don't give a shit about them! We lost!
Don't worry about Barry.
Spinning the girl off!
Oh, Fran...
Are you out of that apricot scrub?
Nearly, Mrs Hastings.
I'll bring some in tomorrow with the toner.
Thanks, Mrs Hastings.
Grand Roulette in!
I don't want us to end up
like that drunk Ken Railings!
Ken Railings is a ballroom king!
Good, Clarry!
I've smoothed it over.
When Les Kendall talks, Barry Fife listens!
I've got my happy face on, Les!
Everything's gonna be all right!
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!
I'm sorry, Mrs Hastings. I have tried.
God knows I have tried!
But your son isn't even interested
in winning at the Pan Pacifics!
He and I are no longer partners.
Hi, Liz!
Vanessa!
Tango, please!
Oh, Vanessa...!
Come on.
This stupid studio's a nightmare!
Oh, my God, Shirley!
Stay calm, Les. Stay calm.
Here he comes.
Doug! Doug!
- Son, can I bend your ear for a tick?
- Not now, Dad.
Don't speak to your father like that!
He's trying to talk to you.
Talk to him, Doug.
Scotty! You gonna do that bogo pogo?
Did you like how I danced at the weekend?
- What?
- Did you like how I danced?
- I dunno. You didn't win, did ya?
- But did you like it?
I dunno! Are you ready?
You were gonna help with the bogo pogo.
I'm asking what you thought of
how I danced on the weekend.
I told you, I don't know.
Jesus, Wayne!
Mm-mm!
We had an agreement!
Arms, Clarry!
Maybe I changed my mind.
Maybe I'm sick of somebody else's steps.
The people who passed on those steps
know more about dancing than you do!
- The audience didn't think so.
- Oh, the audience! The audience!
Forward on the heel, Fran!
What would they know?
Flashy choreography... Crowd-pleasing,
sure, but where was your floor craft?
Arms, Clarry!
No energy directed into the floor.
Untidy feet and hands.
Arms, Clarry!
You think that can win
the Pan Pacific Grand Prix?
Does he really think that can win
the Pan Pacific Grand Prix?
He also said that what we dance is crap.
And then...
..he ripped her dress.
What's more,
you won't win without a partner.
Scott and Liz are still fighting, Mrs H.
I won't let that bother me, Clarry.
Got my happy face on today.
Well, Fran, you managed to upset Lizzie.
I'd better go and apologise.
Go to that little girl and beg forgiveness.
You're nothing without her, Scott.
Remember, it takes two to tango.
You've a light in you, boy. Let it shine!
Hi, Liz!
Right...
I knew you'd come to your senses.
No!
I don't want this!
I don't want this!
What do you want!
What do I want? I'll tell you what I want!
I want Ken Railings to walk in and say
Pam Short's broken both her legs...
..and I wanna dance with you!
Pam Short's broken both her legs,
and I wanna dance with you.
That was unexpected!
Thank you very much, class.
Time to go.
Chairs, please, Clarry. Broom, Natalie.
Ken's got his own spa bath.
Great for the aching muscles.
I can do you a fantastic deal on one.
Maybe. Great, Mr Railings.
Clarry...
Ken owns Spa-orama.
Wayne and I are hoping
to do really well this year.
Fran!
Hey, Wayne,
come over here and meet Ken!
Kylie, feed the fish!
Doug, are you coming?
- He's my partner.
- Fiancé!
G'day.
Doug!
Doug!
Doug!
Doug!
Doug, will you hurry up, please!
Doug?
There, there! Where's that happy face?
There, there!
Let's go.
Come on, Wayne.
Don't worry.
We're not going to give up yet.
We'll find Scott a new partner.
Oh, Lessie! He's my only son!
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.
Don't worry, love. Don't worry.
We'll start tryouts tomorrow, hm?
Here's Doug. He'll take you home.
Come on, Shirley.
Goodnight, fishes!
Goodnight, Uncle Les.
Night-night. Sleep tight.
Off we go. Off we go.
Happy face?
Scotty, I...
Scott...
You're still our No.1.
And we've got three weeks.
We'll start tryouts tomorrow.
We'll find you a new partner.
Yeah.
Bullshit!
To pick what was actually wrong
with the steps...
..you'd have to be an experienced
professional. Like myself.
That's looking good.
- What are you doing here?
- I...
How long have you been here?
Two years.
Uh, I was just looking for someone.
- Everyone's gone home.
- Yeah, I know.
It's just I've got this idea.
Like... I mean, it's... um...
It's...
I... wanna try to...
I wanna dance with you.
What?
I wanna dance with you.
I wanna dance with you your way,
at the Pan Pacifics.
The Pan Pacifics?
You wanna dance my way
at the Pan Pacifics?
Yeah.
You can't dance my way. You don't win.
You've been overdoing it. If you kept it
simpler, and danced from the heart...
What?
And had the right partner...
Oh, I see. That's you, is it?
When you dance your steps,
I understand how you feel, cos...
..I make up my own steps, too.
- You make up your own steps?
- And now we both haven't got partners!
Look... what are you carrying on about?
You've never had a partner. You've been
dancing with a girl for two years.
And now you come to me,
who's been dancing since I was six,...
..and you wanna dance non-Federation,
and convince the Pan Pacific judges,...
- ..with three weeks to train?
- Yeah.
I don't think so.
- Just give me a tryout.
- Look, go home.
- Just one hour.
- This is embarrassing.
I just need a chance!
You are gonna feel a real idiot about this!
Do you want to dance
your own steps or not?
It's none of your business!
Well, do you?
Look, a beginner has no right
to approach an Open Amateur.
An Open Amateur has no right
to dance non-Federation steps.
- But you did.
- That's different.
How is it different?
You think you're different but you're not!
You're just scared!
You're scared to give someone new a go
because they might be better than you are!
You're pathetic and you're gutless!
Vivir con miedo es como vivir a medias!
What's your name again?
Fran.
Yeah, Fran what?
Just Fran.
All right, then, Just Fran.
Don't push me.
Rumba.
- Oh, you can't even do a basic!
- You said one hour.
One, two, three, four. One, two.
One, hold, two.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
Two, three, four. One, two...
We're telling a story.
The rumba's the dance of love.
Look at me like you're in love.
That's it. Good.
Turn, two, three, four. And...
..one, two, three, four.
Good, that's it.
We'll do one basic, a spin,
and then a lunge. Okay?
Right. And one, two, and...
One, turn, and lunge.
One, turn, and lunge.
One, turn, and lunge.
Okay.
Lunge. Drag, pull. Drag.
One turn, there.
I know...
Wait, wait, wait.
We'll go one and two...
Hey, we could... we...
Where did that come from?
It's a step I've been working on at home.
Show me?
Well...
She's got no body flight.
Good.
Strong back.
A bit of musicality, please!
Good.
Good. Yeah.
Come back in... but not too far.
She's terrible!
They're too tall, too short, too tubby...
Well, you know, fat. It's as if he doesn't
wanna find anyone who's compatible.
Now, this one's Island Fantasy.
And that's $11.95.
Oh, see, that's you!
He was supposed to help with our
bogo pogo. Never even showed up!
With a guy like Scott it could be anything.
Sexuality, drugs... you know.
He's obviously lost it, sweetie.
He's all washed up!
- No!
- Sorry.
Take a break.
How are the tryouts going?
Good. Really good.
- Your mum and Les were great dancers.
- Yeah. They were.
They don't talk about it very much.
No. It's cos of Dad.
Look, Fran,...
The roof.
What's he doing?
Oh, he's always hiding away
doing something.
Can you dance without those?
Might help.
Come on, we've got work to do.
# Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick
# And think of you
# Caught up in circles
# Confusion is nothing new
# Flash back, warm nights
# Almost left behind
# A suitcase of memories
# Time after...
# Sometimes you picture me
# I'm walking too far ahead
# You're calling to me
# I can't hear what you've said
# Then you say go slow
# I fall behind
# The second hand unwinds
# If you're lost you can look
and you will find me
# Time after time
# If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting
# Time after time
It was his year! It was his year!
It was his year! It was his year...!
It was his year!
It was Scott's year, Luke,
and now he's thrown it all away.
- You wouldn't do that, would you, Lukey?
- No.
Les'll find a partner.
There's no time, Doug!
A champion like Tina Sparkle isn't going
around wondering who to dance with!
Why don't you and Mrs Hastings
go in the Over-35s, Mr Hastings?
I don't like competition.
- Dad doesn't go in the competitions.
- But you should have a go, Mr Hastings.
Doug, will you stop that!
Stop that shuffling, you stupid man!
I can't bear it!
I just can't bear it!
Don't cry, Mum. Scott'll find a new partner.
Don't worry, he will.
# If you're lost you can look
and you will find me
# Time after time
# If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting
# Time after time
# If you fall I will catch you
# I will be waiting
# Time after time
- You're ready.
- What for?
I want you and me to try out
for Les tomorrow night.
At the State?
- Really?
- Yep.
# Time after time
Vivir con miedo es como vivir... a... a...
Vivir a medias.
Vivir con miedo es como vivir a medias.
Yeah!
Um... to live with fear is like to half live.
I mean, is a life half-lived.
Oh, yeah?
- Like a proverb.
- Yeah, sort of.
A life half-lived.
I like it.
- Well, see you at the State tomorrow.
- Okay.
- Is the rumba the right one to do?
- Yeah. Les'll love it.
I do, too!
The rumba, I mean.
Fran,...
..you know what I said about
the rumba being the dance of love?
- Yeah?
- Well...
Yeah?
It's pretend.
You pretend to be in love. It's not real.
Oh! Oh, no! I didn't think...
- Are you all right?
- You'd better go. I'll see you tomorrow.
The State Championships,
featuring the magical Mr Nathan Starkey...
..and Miss Tina Sparkle!
I want Tina to be Scott's new partner, Les.
Tina Sparkle?
That's right, Les. Bloody Nathan's
going to announce his retirement tonight.
Scott and Tina are both without partners.
It'd be advantageous
if they were seen together.
But Scott's shenanigans
have been causing quite a stir!
That's why he needs to be seen dancing
the right steps with the right partner!
Dance sport needs
good young couples, Merv.
Terry's right, Merv. Let's not chuck
the babies out with the bathtub.
I'm 100% behind it, Barry!
Francisca!
Well, gentlemen... Let's make this
a bloody good festival.
Oh, er... Les... Just a tick.
This is wonderful, Barry. Wonderful.
He doesn't deserve her, Les.
I've been fielding phone calls all week
about Scott's steps.
Oh, Scott's learnt his lesson, Barry.
He's changed.
We both know where he was heading.
Foolish boy.
But Scott's got his second chance.
Let's not forget, Les, that
a Pan Pacific Champion becomes a hero.
A guiding light to all dancers.
Someone who'll set the right example.
You've been drinking!
- Bullshit! Push it!
- You bloody have!
I love dancing, Les.
And I'm not gonna let what we've
fought for all these years be destroyed.
Go, 71!
Go, 71!
- You're drunk!
- Bullshit!
You bloody are!
69!
Come on!
Get your head up!
Come on, 54!
Do you two know this girl
Scott's trying out with?
- Who is it, Mum?
- Oh, I'd be the last to know!
Scott says we'll never guess.
Hey, Clarry, have you seen Fran?
No. Maybe she got a lift with Natalie.
It's our first big comp today.
Les, do you know about this girl?
Jesus, news travels fast!
- Who is it, Uncle Les?
- Oh, you sourpusses! Look!
"Pan Pacific champion Tina Sparkle
is hunting for a new partner."
"Her partner of 10 years, Nathan Starkey,...
..is retiring to spend time on his
landscape gardening business."
"Their farewell exhibition
is at the State Finals."
"The question is, who will snaffle Tina?"
Scott Hastings, that's who!
Oh, my God! Tina Sparkle!
Les, do you think she'll dance with him?
Straight after her exhibition, she's
hopping into the social dance with Scott!
And the next to dance will be
the mother and son...
Doug, it's an answer to our prayers!
She's a nice little chicken.
Photographs well.
Frannie, isn't it exciting!
I thought he'd never find a new partner!
- And now it's turned out wonderfully!
- Do you think so?
Of course I do!
Les and I are beside ourselves!
I'm very happy, too.
Course you are, lovey.
Gee, you look nice tonight.
You've been using that buff puff,
haven't you?
I might jump in there myself!
Mr Kendall!
Oh, Mum... I was gonna tell you...
Oh, yes, very funny, you little devil!
Well, we know all about it!
- Bloody fantastic, mate!
- You should've told us!
Uncle Les was on to it first!
- You haven't seen us dance yet.
- Oh, you two were made for each other!
Find it difficult to get the films now.
It's all video, video, video.
For goodness' sake, Doug, she's not
interested! Look! She's beside herself!
Oh, who would've thought it! Our Scott
dancing with someone like Tina Sparkle!
Yes! The fairy princess of the dance
floor, Tina Sparkle, and for the last time...
Tina Sparkle?
Fran, I...
..Mr Nathan Starkey!
Ooh, isn't Tina beautiful!
Dancing together for the last time,...
..Mr Nathan Starkey...
..and Miss Tina Sparkle!
What a great partnership!
And what a show!
As they dance for you...
..the fruity rumba!
She's a funny girl!
Back in a minute.
The beginning of a lovely
double rondé shuffle!
Watch it, Frangipanni!
Listen, sweetie,
I'm driving the engine around here.
If you're driving the engine,
what's that in the Thermos?
- Hi, Scott.
- Have you seen Fran?
Fran who?
Ohh!
Jeez...
Flowing into a quick whip split!
Beaut!
A beautifully arced crescent moon!
That'll go down a treat with the judges
at the Pan Pacifics this year.
- Do you know where Scott went?
- Do you know where Scott went?
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
It's a classy twilight lift!
Oh, look at this!
Fran, I didn't know anything about that.
Are you gonna dance with Tina?
I...
She's a champion.
You should. She's your style.
You really suit each other.
I've been working towards winning
the Pan Pacific since I was six years old.
I'm sure you'll win.
I could never do that.
# You won't admit you love me
# And so
# How am I ever
# To know?
# You always tell me
# Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.
# A million times I've asked you
# And then
# I ask you over
# Again.
# You only answer
# Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.
# If you can't make your mind up
# We'll never
# Get started.
# And I don't wanna wind up
# Being parted,
# Broken-hearted.
# So if you really love me
# Say yes.
# But if you don't, dear,
# Confess.
# And please don't tell me
# Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.
# If you can't make your mind up
# We'll never
# Get started.
# And I don't wanna wind up
The inconceivable sight of Scott
dancing with Fran!
# Broken-hearted.
So if you really love me
Check it out.
# Say yes.
# But if you don't, dear,
# Confess.
# And please don't tell me
# Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.
# Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.
You're kidding!
Give them a big hand!
Quickly!
Tina's coming! Hurry!
Scott, Tina's coming!
- Mum...
- I'm helping Fran. I don't wanna hear it.
Tina will be dancing
with a new partner!
Oh!
Tina! Wonderful! Wonderful!
The fruit... everything!
President Fife wants a word
with you and Scott.
- Now!
- What's going on?
A silly accident. This poor girl fell.
I'm Shirley Hastings.
Scott, Tina's been dying to meet you.
Scott, we'll look after Fran.
You have a chat with President Fife.
Better not keep him waiting!
We'll be back for the social, Tina.
Come on, Scott.
Scott...
Top routine, Teens.
Ohh...!
I thought that was good.
- Come on, come on...
- Mrs Hastings...
I don't know what you were thinking of!
There's obviously been goings-on! But...
..we're gonna fix that nasty bruise.
And then...
..it'd be best if you went home.
- But...
- You're a beginner!
- What did you think you were doing?
- And you're clumsy. That's why you fell.
- Scott wanted...
- Of course Scott would say that!
But you don't wanna
ruin his chances, do you?
Do you?
Now,...
..you can see it would be best
for everybody if you just went home...
..and forgot all about this.
Can't you, Frannie?
Can't you?
Yes, Mrs Hastings.
I understand Les has lined you up
with Tina Sparkle.
Listen to your teachers, or there won't be a
mark on the scorecard low enough for you
- Comprende?
- Barry's only thinking of you.
Where would we be
if everyone made it up?
Out of a job.
Don't listen to him, Barry. He's excited
because he's going to dance with Tina.
Scott!
Scott!
- We can't expect Tina to wait all night...
- Yes, I know, Terry, I'm sorry...
Ah, Tina!
You look terrific!
- What was that all about?
- What?
- You know. With Fran.
- Fran? Fran, Fran... Fran?
- Fran! Fran, Fran...
- Fran? Wasn't she that girl that...
Well, here we all are!
- Where is she?
- Who?
Fran.
- Fran who?
- Fran, the girl that fell.
Oh, she went home. Don't worry about her.
- What?
- She went shopping.
- She had to make a phone call.
- You're pathetic.
- What's wrong with you?
- Yes, what's wrong with me?
What is so wrong with the way I dance?
Come on now, Scott. Tina's waiting.
You're so scared
you wouldn't know what you thought!
- Is he dancing with Tina or not?
- Yeah...
- I'm sorry, Tina, I'm not available.
- No, Scott... Wayne!
- Wayne!
- Scott!
What's going on!
Care for a dance, Teens?
- Jesus, you danced impressively today!
- Do you think so, Mr Fife?
You should try a bogo pogo
in your samba, though.
- It's a terrific step!
- Well, actually, Mr Fife...
- It's in me video.
- Er, well...
- Take this one.
- Gee, thanks, Mr Fife!
Scott's not the only one
with a future to think about.
- It's Wayne, isn't it?
- Yeah. Wayne.
I've seen this bad influence before, Wayne.
You know one bad egg
can rot the whole barrel.
Know what I mean?
Hm?
Fran!
- Fran!
- What are you doing here?
- I wanna dance with you.
- Go away. I'll get in trouble.
What about a life lived in fear?
It's no use.
You were right.
I'm a beginner.
- I'll never be like them.
- I don't want you to be like them.
You're better than them.
Fran... I wanna dance with you...
..at the Pan Pacifics.
We won't win.
I just wanna dance our steps.
Francisca!
Quién es este?
Es mi... my dancing partner.
You go now! Go!
- Go!
- No!
We just dance together, that's all!
What sort of dance do you dance
so late at night?
Paso doble.
Paso doble? Tú bailas paso doble?
What?
You dance the paso doble?
Yeah!
Show.
Show.
Yes. We want to see this paso doble.
- Queremos ver este paso doble, verdad?
- Sí.
Venga. Enséñame.
Come on. Show us your paso doble.
Show me your paso doble.
Venga.
Hey, it's all right.
Just try and keep up.
Four-count intro.
What! What's so funny!
Paso doble?
Huh!
Paso doble.
Bravo! Bravo!
Grandma would like to teach us.
Dónde sientes tú el ritmo?
Where do you feel the rhythm?
No! No!
Aquí, de aquí. Mira.
Listen to the rhythm. Don't be scared.
- Acompáñame.
- You follow.
Hey!
Muy bien, chaval.
Have you eaten?
There's some chops in the fridge.
No, I'm fine.
How could you!
How could you do that to Tina!
She's a Pan Pacific champion!
- Mum...
- First thing in the morning, apologise.
- I won't be dancing with Tina.
- What?
- I'm dancing with Fran.
- Fran?
Doug...!
He said he won't be dancing with Tina!
- I heard.
- So do something about it, you silly man!
- Why pick on Dad all the time?
- How dare you speak to me like that!
The sacrifices we have made for you!
Money! Time! Effort!
Shut up!
Les has taught you everything
and you throw it back in his face!
- I'm bored with it!
- I don't believe I'm hearing this!
I have been with your father for 25 years!
Do you think I get bored? Of course I do!
Stick with your goals
and they bring their own rewards.
- What rewards?
- The Pan Pacifics!
I don't care about winning the Pan Pacific!
Ooh!
He doesn't care about winning
the Pan Pacific Grand Prix?
He just wants to dance
his silly steps with Fran!
- Great for the studio!
- Wayne, don't get carried away by this.
It's true, Mrs H. Like President Fife says,
one bad egg can rot the whole barrel.
You are all overreacting.
Nothing terrible is going to happen!
What?
Ken... dropped me.
Ohh...
You just got not to be... scared.
All right?
You remind me of your mother, you know?
I am very proud of you.
And if...
..if your mum was here...
..she will be very proud!
Francisca!
Fran! Francisca!
It's too jazzy.
Don't throw away your energy.
See? Keep the focus between you.
The face... strong.
Sí. Uno, dos, tres...
Uno, dos, tres...
Tres!
Tres!
Tres!
Muy bien.
Very good.
Vamos a bailar. Vamos. Los dos.
Uno, dos, y tres.
New steps, new steps, new steps!
New steps, new steps, new steps!
New steps, new steps...
New steps!
New steps! New steps!
New steps! New steps!
New steps! New steps!
There are no new steps!
I unequivocally state there are no new
steps for the Pan Pacific Grand Prix!
Comprende?
This is getting out of hand.
Oh, Charm, stop it!
I've gotta think.
Something's gotta be done about this.
If you can't dance a step,
you can't teach it.
And if you can't teach it,
we might as well pack it in.
With Liz available, you've a chance to get
your status quo vadis back. So to speak.
We've tried everything we can
to convince him!
- Except the truth.
- What do you mean?
Look, we all go back too far
to beat about the bush.
I know we agreed that the past
should be left in the past.
But it's about time that lad
learned some home truths.
I'd better fill the drinks machine.
You are ready, kids! You are ready!
Yes. They're ready.
We've tried everything we can
to convince him!
Except the truth.
Are you nervous about tomorrow?
Yeah. Are you?
- I never thought we'd make it.
- Me, neither.
Fran...
Yeah?
You know what I said about the rumba?
And it being pretend?
Yeah.
Well...
What?
I think I made a mistake.
Oh, no!
What?
I promised Wayne I'd help him with his...
- Bogo pogo!
- Bogo pogo!
Better not keep him waiting.
Vivir con miedo
es como vivir a medias!
Wayne!
Wayne!
Wayne's not here.
Hope you don't mind.
We know we can't win,...
..but we're gonna dance, anyway.
So let's not waste each other's time.
He was the most beautiful dancer
I'd ever seen.
What?
He could've been the greatest
champion of all. He was like you.
Threw it all away.
Who?
The man in this photograph.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about...
..the man who was potentially the greatest
ballroom dancer this country's ever seen.
I'm talking about your father.
Doug Hastings.
Oh, come on! Dad doesn't even dance.
You think it's funny?
You think it's funny, do you?
I worshipped that man! We all did!
Doug Hastings was an inspiration to us all.
But that's Les.
Les was Mum's partner.
No, Scott.
That's Doug.
I know to look at him today
it's hard to believe, but once...
Once.
Ah, once...
Doug and Shirley Hastings were the best
bloody couple this country had ever seen.
Couple No.100,
Doug and Shirley Hastings!
Couple No.100,
Doug and Shirley Hastings!
Couple No.100.
You know, Scott, your dad, he had it all.
Looks, charm, confidence...
He had everything.
Everything!
My God, he was magnificent!
Samba, cha-cha, rumba, jive... anything!
He could do anything!
Brilliant!
All the giris loved him.
My goodness,
he showed those chickies a thing or two!
I was your dad's best mate in those days.
We used to scruff it together.
You know, swing it around.
Lessie would come along, of course.
The three of us together!
The old gang.
We were a bunch of old funsters.
We all wanted to win, of course.
But with your mum as your dad's partner,
we had no chance.
They were magnificent!
They had it all before them.
A perfect career.
And then...
..everything changed.
Your dad became... I don't know...
..self-obsessed... focused on himself.
A selfish dancer.
I didn't know what to make of it.
He started doing his own thing.
lmprovising! Throwing in crazy,
wild, crowd-pleasing steps!
A bit like yourself, Scott.
Not always...
..strictly ballroom.
Shirley put up with it for as long as
she bloody well could.
It was only a matter of time
before she eventually...
..cracked.
I tried to warn him,
but, no, he wouldn't listen.
He wouldn't listen to any of us!
He was convinced he could win the Pan
Pacific Grand Prix dancing his own steps!
Of course, they lost.
I was lucky enough to win that year.
The shock sent Doug crazy.
He vowed he'd never dance again.
For a while there
we didn't think he'd pull through.
Slowly, little by little,...
..day by day,...
..he managed to crawl back
from the dark pit of despair...
..and tack together
some semblance of a life.
When you were born...
..Doug found a reason to live.
He vowed that one day...
..you'd win the trophy
that he could never win.
That's why I've been
so hard on you, Scott.
For Doug to see you so close,
and go the same way he went,...
..it'd be too much for him to bear.
I really think it'd kill him.
I managed to...
..save this as a souvenir.
Doug got... rid of everything else.
Don't tell anybody I've got it.
Why...
..didn't anyone tell me?
Doug destroyed your mother's career.
We had to keep it from you.
Your father's a proud man, Scott.
He wouldn't want me to do this,
but I'm begging you.
Dance with Liz. Win the Pan Pacific once,
just once, for Doug.
He's suffered enough, Scott.
Don't you think he deserves
a... little happiness?
Of course, it's up to you.
You do what you think's best.
I know you'll make the right decision.
Dance with Liz. Win the Pan Pacific once,
just once, for Doug.
He's suffered enough, Scott.
The Pan Pacific Grand Prix!
Come on, Scott!
Put your hands together,
ladies and gentlemen!
The magnificent old-time Viennese!
Thank you, couples!
You may leave the floor.
- Very good, darling! Very good!
- Thank you.
Straight down the line! Couldn't fault it!
Well done! Well done!
- Jesus, Ken!
- I only had one drink!
Poor Tina. It's like dancing in a brewery.
Couples for the Beginners' Final,
please take the floor.
Look, Scott, it's Fran!
I didn't think she'd turn up.
- Back in Beginners, where she belongs.
- And she stole my partner.
You made the right decision, mate.
I know at times it's been confusing
for you, Scott.
But I speak for the whole studio...
..when I say that by putting your trust in
the Federation you're doing the right thing.
And I think this will be reflected in the
big one yet to come - the Open Latin Final!
We're right behind you, boy!
Son, can I bend your ear for a tick?
Doug! Don't be stupid!
He's gotta get ready for the Latin!
I must get back to the scrutineers' table.
Go for it, boy!
Come on, come on, come on.
We ain't got that much time.
Qué bonita está!
Si encuentro a ese cabrón, lo mato!
It isn't, Wayne!
It's a quick one, a-two, a-three, a-four.
You go back to the ball point from there!
- Excuse me, Mr Fife.
- What is it, son?
The bogo pogo, Mr Fife.
That step you suggested?
Did l?
You said you'd show it to us
if I, er... arranged that thing for you.
- Bit of a hurry, son.
- You know my partner? Vanessa Cronin?
Well!
Hello, sweetie!
Having trouble with
the old bogo pogo, are we?
The trick is to go down on one heel ball.
Pull the weight up onto the chest,
puffing it out proud like a peacock.
Then a quick syncopating two and three,
and three, and four...
Comprende?
Gee! Thanks, Mr Fife!
Gotta run. Good luck for tonight, kids.
- Son, can I bend...
- Not now, Dad.
What happened to a life lived in fear and
all that! You really are a gutless wonder!
- There's a reason for this.
- I don't wanna hear.
- Listen to me!
- No!
- It's hard for me too, Fran.
- Hard?
Hard?
How hard do you think it's been for me...
..to get you to dance with me
in the first place?
Frangipanni delasqueegeemop! Wash the
coffee cups, Fran! How's your skin, Fran?
Hard?
You don't understand.
I understand.
You've got your Pan Pacifics to win
and I'm back in Beginners where I belong.
Fran!
- Can I bend your ear for a tick?
- Not now...
Yes, now, Scott!
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the main event of the evening,...
..the Pan Pacific Grand Prix
Amateur Five Dance Latin Final!
Mr Fife! Mr Fife!
Wayne!
But you ball-change on the one!
Wayne, it doesn't matter!
Come on!
It's okay, Dad. I'm dancing with Liz.
- There's something you must know.
- Don't worry, Dad, I know.
Mr Fife!
Pissed as a fart!
- Wayne!
- You can hardly stand up!
I've set it up for you to win,
no matter how you dance.
- I can't go on. I've lost the old magic.
- Pull yourself together, Railings!
But I have always regretted...
Dancing your own steps at the Pan Pacific
Grand Prix. I know!
I'm not gonna make that same mistake.
I never danced at the Pan Pacific
Grand Prix.
Barry told me you lost the Pan Pacific
dancing your own steps.
Barry?
Your year, Ken. Just go through
the motions, and it's in the bag.
When Hastings loses,
his credibility will be shot.
- I'll go and polish the trophy.
- Thanks, Mr Fife.
Oh!
- Barry convinced her.
- Convinced who?
Couple No.100,
Scott Hastings and Elizabeth Holt!
Your mother.
Doug! He's being called, you silly man!
Wayne Burns and Vanessa...
Wayne, we're being called!
It's none of our business!
Les!
Les!
Here. Use this.
Final call for...
Psst! Les! Psst!
..Wayne Burns and Vanessa Cronin.
- Mr Railings, your number, please?
- Spud out, nerd!
Couple No.69,...
..Ken Railings and Tina Sparkle!
- What are you on about, Dad?
- I never danced at the Pan Pacific!
Shut up!
Barry convinced your mother
to dance with Les.
Stop it!
- Don't listen to him, Scott!
- Why didn't you dance with Dad?
- With his silly steps, we would've lost!
- You lost anyway!
- You should've stuck by me...
- I did it for you, Doug!
- It cost us our dream, Shirley!
- Barry said there was too much at stake!
With no dancing career
we would never have been able to teach!
I couldn't throw all that away on a dream!
We had to survive!
100. Scott Hastings and Elizabeth Holt.
Scott!
Scott!
Scott!
This is the final call...
..for couple No.100,
Scott Hastings and Elizabeth Holt.
Don't listen to him, Scott. Get on that floor.
You can win, Scott. Win.
Win! Win!
- It was the dancing that mattered!
- He doesn't know what he's saying!
You get out there and dance!
We should've put that above everything!
We had the chance but we were scared!
We lived our lives in fear!
No!
No, Scott, no!
No...!
No...!
Break out the Bollinger, sweet chops.
Are you sure?
We heard 'em.
Fran!
- Why aren't you...
- There's no time.
Do you still wanna dance with me?
I brought this just in case!
Come on...
- I want a word with you.
- It's not my fault the boy chickened out.
- It would've made no difference, anyway.
- Out the back.
I know what's going on. It doesn't matter
what Scott dances out there today.
You betrayed his father...
- Doug wanted me to dance with Shirley!
- It's easy to believe what you wanna hear.
Go, Ken!
- You won't get away with this!
- Listen, you little fag! You hear that?
That's the future of dance, sport,
and no-one is gonna change that!
What the...
Oye, mi niña!
Gimme that bloody thing.
No, you don't!
This is...
Shit!
Cut the music.
Cut the music!
- He's gonna cut the music!
- Barry...
Quick, get inside!
Shut the door! Lock it!
It's not working!
We have...
..a disqualification.
This is Barry Fife speaking.
Scott Hastings and partner
are suspended...
..until further notice.
Will Scott Hastings and partner
please leave the floor?
This is a final warning
for Scott Hastings and partner...
..to please... leave the floor!
Listen to the rhythm.
Don't be scared.
No, you don't, little miss!
Shame on you, Miss Leachman!
Shall we dance?
