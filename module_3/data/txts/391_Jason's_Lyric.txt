Leave me alone!
Get out!
Ghosts-
I guess everyone lives with 'em.
Some good, some bad.
But memories won't let you forget.
They have a way
of boomeranging...
changing a life forever.
There you go!
Maddog taught us about magic.
Said he talked with God,
and God told him where to find it.
- And we went there...
- Come here, Josh.
once a week and just stared
at the blue skies...
blinded by the sun.
We smiled...
waiting for a miracle...
waiting for the rainmaker.
It's way over there.
That's it.
Remember, water.
Don't be scared, Josh.
Lookit, Dad!
See it coming!
Okay, now.
Here it comes. Duck!
You're listening to KMJQ
Houston-Galveston.
Magic 102 FM is beamed to you
on your radio. You're looking good.
Magic weather, it's gonna be
sunny and hot this afternoon.
We're expecting a high of 90.
Right now in Galveston it's 89 degrees.
It's 88 in Third Ward...
and it's 90 right now
at Magic 102 FM.
Mama'd say...
Vietnam drove Maddog crazy.
She'd say when he lost his leg...
he lost his mind.
Maddog!
- The proper command is-
- Cease fire!
- But I wanted to love him.
- Come here and give your daddy a hug.
- I wanted the magic back.
- Whoa! God, you're getting big!
How you feeling?
- All right.
- You're fine? How's your mama doing?
She's fine.
Baby take care of your mama,
don't you?
You know we're gonna be
a family again.
Josh!
Y'all boys want to get
some ice cream?
Yeah. Josh, you want some ice cream?
That's a good idea.
Maddog, stop.
You're hurting him.
Don't worry about it, okay?
We'll have some ice cream
another day, okay?
- You got some money in your pocket?
- Nah. This for me?
- Yeah.
- Thanks.
You know you're not supposed to leave
the house without money in your pocket.
- Can I have some?
- Watch it!
Come here!
Don't try to steal stuff from me, boy!
Why, I'll kill you!
Stop, Maddog!
Who you messing with, boy?
You don't never disrespect
a man's property.
You always give a man his proper.
- You know I love you, right?
- Yeah.
- You know that, right?
- Yeah.
Jason!
Tell your mama I love her,
all right?
Night, Maddog.
Josh and Maddog never got along.
Could never get used to
the mood swings.
He thought Maddog was shit
'cause that's how he treated Mama.
I knew that made Maddog kinda sad.
Watch out there.
Look, Fast Fred!
I won, man. I won!
- What's up?
- What's up, Josh, Jason?
- What you doing?
- Nothing, man. Just doing that.
- Do a dance, Fred.
- Oh, baby.
Go, Fast.
The master.
Neighborhood won't hold me.
- All right.
- I'm outta here, baby.
Coming up with news and sports
in just a little while.
We'll be talking about Jimmy Carter
firing a couple of cabinet members-
- You're gonna get us in trouble!
- Oh, yeah?
Man, gimme the ball back!
I'm gonna take that ball.
Come on, baby!
- Go home, Maddog!
- You can see me out here.
- I'm telling you, go home!
- I love you.
About once a week like clockwork...
Maddog came by.
His knock was always heavy, like
a wounded fist hitting a hollow wall.
Mama always acted unaffected...
but we knew she was afraid-
afraid of what he might do
with the chain unlocked.
Mama!
You okay?
- He didn't get in, did he?
- No, baby.
You all go and get washed up for dinner.
It'll be ready in a minute.
Mama, I'll set the table.
- All right, sugar.
- Okay.
- Why can't he leave us the fuck alone?
- Joshua, you watch your mouth!
- Jay, go see after your brother.
- Okay. Josh!
Calm down, Josh.
Come back here.
You gotta learn to watch your mouth.
I know Mama didn't mean no harm.
She's probably in a bad mood.
You gonna learn
to watch your mouth?
I know that Maddog made you mad.
He ain't nothing but a drunk.
He didn't always
used to be like this.
He used to do
a lot of special things with us.
- I guess you was too young.
- Do you think Mama ever loved him?
Yeah.
I mean, they loved each other.
Everything's gonna be all right.
I promise.
Gloria.
Marry me.
Come here.
I can't do this no more.
You gotta marry me.
Can't you see I'm begging?
- A man ain't a man...
- Get out!
unless he takes care of his wife...
and kid.
Got to remember that.
Gloria!
Open up the door!
Maddog, go home.
Come on, baby. I got something for you.
Just come on and open up the door.
- No, please, just go home.
- Please, baby. Please.
- Open up the door.
- I don't want nothing you got.
Come on.
Open up the door.
Open up the goddamn door!
What's wrong with you?
I got some flowers.
I don't want what you've got.
I don't whatever it is you've got.
- Take the goddamn flowers!
- No!
- Marry me.
- No.
I ain't gonna marry you.
It's my leg, right?
Go on and say it.
It's my leg. Say it.
It ain't got nothing to do
with your leg, okay?
- I told you.
- I ain't man enough for you?
Stop it, okay? Stop it!
Damn it, stop it!
Leave me alone!
Get out!
Get out! Just get out!
- Morning, Mama.
- Morning, Jason.
Fixing to go.
Drive careful.
Get him home safe.
I see you didn't forget the way.
Nigger, I done drove this road
four times.
Yeah.
Well, four times is a charm.
I thought it was three.
Man, you know niggers in the wards
can't count.
Well, you better count your blessings,
'cause once again...
Mama's letting your black ass
come home.
Come on.

nothing to do with the world.
That's why I'm gonna get me a job

You know I got to keep my ride fresh

- This nigger's always eating.
- Goddamn right.
Nigger, you eat so much trash,
ain't no wonder you're full of shit.
Yeah, I eat a lot of trash.
I eat a lot of pussy too.
A luxury your ass couldn't afford
in the penitentiary.
You remember your old girl
when you went in? Wanna smell her pussy?
Have your ass home
by 8:00 though.
Not a minute later.
Surprise!
Surprise, baby! Surprise.
Hey! All right!
"Welcome home, Joshua."
Oh, man.
Oh, shit.
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

Damn! What's happening, baby?
Hey, man, come on.
You done had a little too much to drink.

Don't trip, now. Come on.
Sorry, Miss Alexander.
Hey, man.

Just go to sleep, man.
Hey, where you all going?
Where's everybody going?
Come on.
There's a party going on here.
Come on. You all don't go nowhere.
Watch out. Let me turn this music on.
Aw, come on, Mama.

You've got to get up!
Let's go.

Oh, go ahead

Gloria, open the door.
Open the goddamn door!
No! Stop it!
Leave me alone!
I see you still up early
'cause you having them dreams...

You don't need to worry about
my problems. You need to get a job.
I'll get a fucking job
when I'm ready.
Hey, fuck you, man. I'm not gonna
put Mama through this shit no more.
What you need to do
is get off that goddamn bottle.
What I need is to get you
off my goddamn back.
Didn't you learn nothing in prison?
Damn!
That's what I learned.
Hey, Josh.
Hold up, man.
Hey, man. I'm here to help.
You know, you just say the word,
and we're cool.
Done.
We cool?
You gonna do right, man?
Yeah.
Come on, Josh. You're lollygagging
like you're constipated.
You know you got
some chickens to pluck.
Yo, this shit ain't me, man.
Wearing a uniform.
Saluting some French cook.
I know it ain't the dope.
It's nine to five.
Mama done begged the man to get you
this job. Just do it for Mama, okay?
102 JAMZ. I thought only I was hot
in this city, but I know it's hot now.
I'm looking across the street at
the summit, and I seen four people melt.
By the way,
they were police officers.
Sign them up on extended warranty,
Clover, all right?
Your station, 102 JAMZ.
Well, you'll be doing
a lot more of that soon.
- What do you mean?
- My cousin just called, son.
You are going to be
an assistant manager.
Heard the news today.
They got a position open in Dallas.
- No shit.
- No shit!
- For real?
- For real.
Now, you go on over there
and make me some more money.
Yeah, let me tell you about shit
They got shit in the wall
Shit that travels
and will stick to you
And it grows in your mind
It grows in your mind
and in your soul
They got shit like that
Shit that won't let you forget
Shit that'll clog up your mind
and make everything nasty
Shit that won't let you
You can't wipe it away
You can't rub it away
You can't scrub it away
Mama! Hey, Mama.
You know I got good news.
You ain't gonna believe what happened.
Put your prettiest dress on-
For seven years
I've been assistant manager.
Seven years.
I've been in charge of eight,
sometimes ten people at a time.
Lord, I've had my problems.
But in seven years
my register's never come up short.
That made me proud.
And in one day...
my child took my seven years
for ten dollars!
Oh, I've tried to love him.
It's been hard, but I tried.
I'd have thrown him to the street
long ago if you weren't in my house.
You're like night and day.
Now...
what was your good news?
It's okay.
We'll talk about it later.
You okay, Mom?
I'll be fine.
Now, I gotta get you off the stage.
You hungry?
I ain't seen that many dents
on my automobile.
I don't know why you're trying
to play me out, girl.
You know you want me.
I'll let you do anything
you want to do to me, freaky.
Just don't touch my hair.
Oh, come on, girl.
You're gonna play me
like I'm baldheaded, huh?
Yo, Teddy-
Let's go home.
- What the fuck you talking about?
- Come on.
Get on off the stage!
I'm sick of your trifling ass!
Goddamn, man.
How could you steal
from your own mama?
Can't you do right?
Like who?
Like you?
I'd rather be locked up for life...
before I was like your punk ass.
Fucking mama's boy.
What?
If you wasn't drunk
I'd kick your ass.
Did I get Jay upset?
So what you going to do now, boy?
Build another airplane?
Goddamn it, Jay!
- Now I gotta fucking get another one.
- No, nigger. No.
No, you're done.
Nigger, you ain't my daddy!
Shit, I ain't got no daddy.
Bang!
Stop it! Stop it!
I don't have those dreams
no more, Jay.
And it's all...
'cause of this.
It's just like garlic.
It helps keep the ghosts away.
Dallas-
some of the finest asses
I've seen in Texas.
- It's a hell of a job, boy.
- I can't take it.
What?
Boy, what you talking about?
I just can't take it.
You're gonna pass up
a salaried job?
Twenty thousand dollars a year.
Boy, you better have a good reason.
Look, Elmo. Don't sweat me, all right?
I just can't take it.
It's that brother of yours,
ain't it?
Every time he gets out...
you start fucking up!
My mama needs my help,
and that's what I'm gonna give her.
Is my TV ready yet?
Hi, Jason.
- How you doing, Mrs. Murphy?
- Please get them kids away from my TVs.
Hell, they probably know how
to fix a TV better than you.
Is my TV ready?
Come on, Ruth.
- You go on over there.
- Mister, you like my plane?
It's a bad mother, ain't it?
Grandma gave it to me. Said my black ass
needed to get used to flying.
Last time we flew to Corpus
to see my aunt...
I threw up all over
my grandma's best hat.
That's why she bought me a plane.
Does that ever happen when you fly?
Don't know.
I've never flown in a plane before.
Sometimes you don't need a plane
to fly.
Sell TVs?
Jason-
I'm Jason Alexander.
That's very nice to know, Jason.
Now can I have my keys?
My brother does need his truck
and I do need to get to work.
Where you work?
Why? You looking for a job?
No, I just thought, maybe, you know,
one night we could get together-
Well...
if it's meant to be,
you'll find me.
All right, you old raggedy-looking
motherfucker, let's try it again.
Which hand is it in, Pigpen?
Nice try, Tommy.
Try again, boy.
Tommy boy.
Freed his mind,
his ass didn't follow.
Sixteen years old.
Used to be the smartest nigger
in the hood.
Dog couldn't have been too smart.
So you was in the joint
with Joshua?
You're a nosy motherfucker,
ain't you?
Inquiring minds want to know.
Brother's from the ward.
- How many stones we got left, man?
- Two.
Man, ain't you tired
of that nickel-and-diming it?
Why? You got something better?
You know me, Josh.
I got a partner
who could set you straight.
I got my gig.
Okay. A gig.
Remember,
gigs can always get better.
I'm cool.
Hey, all right.
Catch you later.
Watch that nigger, man.
Watch your back.
It's the parole board.
Behind you. Give it here.
- What's up?
- Definitely not that shirt.
Shut up, man.
Get that shit out of my face.
Yo, toss me-
Toss me a 40.
So, you pound the pavement today?
You find some work?
Hey, come on, Jay.
You know how this economy is.
I figured I might as well
sit on my ass, eyeing the cootchie...
and just wait out this recession.
Wait it out.
Come on.
- Hey, what's up, girl?
- What's up?
Want an drink? Welcome to my-
Don't touch my hair!
Now, you better not be out here
doing what these fools is doing.
Hey, come on, Jay.
It's just a joke.
Well, you need to get serious
and get you a job.
I'm looking, man.
You looking?
Yeah. I put in four applications
just today.
But ain't nobody dying to hire
a brother fresh out of the joint, man.
You know?
Yeah, I know.
I circled a couple in here
to help you out.
Yeah, all right, man.
I'll check 'em out tomorrow.
Flies around my head.
Excuse me, baby.
Looking and feeling
like an Ethiopian.
Let's go get something to eat, man.
Some pig feet.
We ain't Muslims. Come on, man.
102 JAMZ, the Mad Hatter, and there's
been a lot of bank-jacking going down.
I got to say that Jesse James
1800 attitude is not gonna make it.
What you do in the dark
is gonna come to light.
Enough said, and I'm out.
More phat jams right now
on 102 JAMZ.
- Hey, Lyric.
- How you doing?
So, Lyric, when you gonna be stopping
with the Mother Teresa thing...
and start giving it up
to the brothers?
Alonzo. I didn't mean nothing
by it, man. It was wrong, man.
No. No, Jelly.
You're absolutely correct.
See, Lyric be wearing her panties
so tight...
she ain't got enough room
for that little kitty cat to breathe.
Maybe if she spread her legs more often,
she could chill the fuck out.
Shut the fuck up.
Get out. Parade's over.
What's wrong, little sis?
Wait.
They tripping, huh?
They bothering you?
Come on. Talk to big brother.
Let me know what's going on.
Oh, wait. You mad?
- I know you ain't mad.
- Alonzo.
- I ain't gonna lose no sleep.
- Whatever.
Come here.
- You is leaving?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Well, don't be late.
Come on, baby. You know
even when I'm late, I'm always on time.
- All right.
- Wipe that lipstick up.
Now, you know I get off soon.
Oh, I'll be back.
That man!
102 JAMZ, one for you slow and easy.
That man, girl.
Gives me chills.
Just like a nightmare.
"To give vent now and then
to his feelings...
is a great comfort,
condolence, and...
ease to man's heart."
Francesco Guicciardini.
Girl, I am so sick of you
and your quotes.
Don't knock my self-improvement.
- Oh, is that what that is?
- That's what it is.
What are you illing about, Lyric?
My orthopedic shoes ain't working,
and I'm sick and tired...
of serving these hungry negroes
and my period just started.
Girl, damn!
"lt is terribly amusing how many
different climates of feeling...
one can go through in a day."
Anne Morrow Lindbergh.
Go on, girl.
Get on out of here.
I'll cover for you, okay?
- Marti, you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.
Don't come over here
with all that. Just go.
- Thank you, Marti.
- You're welcome.
I don't know about it,
but Joshua knows about it.
Welcome to This Is lt.
May I help you?
Chicken, black-eyed peas,
corn on the cob, sucker and a pickle.
And you?
Hey, Lyric, girl.
You feeling all right?
No, I'm all right.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Marti, thanks, hear?
Oh, night-night, Lyric.
- Call me?
- I will.
Now, what can I get for you, sir?
Let me get
one of them titties to go...
a side of ass,
and a cup of them lips.
Well, I'm sorry, sir, 'cause they don't
have none of that on the menu.
They look like they need to be
on a tray.
Excuse me, is there anybody else
in here that can serve this fool?
I'm on my break.
Mind if I join you?
- Maybe.
- Then again...
maybe not.
So, where you headed?
Home.
You said if it was meant to be
I'd find you.
Well, I found you.
Guess you're waiting for the bus.
Guess I am.
What?
Don't you know that bus ain't gonna
be on time tonight, girl?
'Cause this is meant to be.
This is magic, see?
So, come on.
Let me give you a ride.
Well, I guess
it wasn't meant to be.
Romeo. You'd have had it by now
if you'd had these.
- Thanks, man. You need anything?
- Just some money.
- Hey, I'll give you $20 for these.
- Hell, no. Not my roses.
- Twenty bucks? Sell 'em, baby!
- But you just gave me these!
- Sold.
- You Indian giver!
I do not need this tonight.
- Beautiful night, ain't it?
- Magical.
Damn, you're cold!
You always this difficult?
Can't you find
somebody else to harass?
Harass?
I thought I was being charming.
- Wrong.
- Come on. Let me give you a ride.
Look, I don't know you, okay?
For all I know, you're a gangsta,
and I don't ride with no gangstas.
Yo, I ain't no gangsta.
I got a job.
Know what I'm saying?
No drugs, no guns-
I sell TVs all day long.
I sold you one,
as a matter of fact.
I wear this corny uniform...
eat fried chicken...
almost every day
'cause my mama works at Frenchy's.
I have nightmares that I'm gonna
grow wings and cluck...
Iike a chicken!
I ask you,
is that the life of a gangsta?
You smiled.
So?
Look...
I ain't even gonna ask you
on a date.
I just want you to hook me up,
you know?
Tell me where you're gonna be
so I can be there too.
If you're going to the market...
I want to be in the same aisle.
If you're going to church...
I want to be in the back pew.
I just want to see you again.
That's all. I promise...
I won't even talk to you.
I just want to see you again.
Anywhere?
Name the place.
The old trestle bridge.
Yes!
Wait a minute! That bridge is barely
standing. It ain't been used in years.
- Well, that's where I'll be.
- Well, when?
When the sun next leaves footprints
across the sky.
Excuse me?
Tomorrow night at 7:00.
Oh, wait!
So, you coming, or what?
Why don't you come down?
All you got to do is
climb up here.
It ain't the climbing
I'm worried about.
It's the falling
that's got me bothered.
You said anywhere.
Yeah.
I said anywhere.
Yo, this is some crazy shit.
So, where do you think it's going?
What?
The bus.
I don't know.
I don't know either.
Isn't that great?
What?
Not knowing!
I mean, you see a bus pass
and all you know is that it's going.
But where?
Where could be anyplace you want.
It's kind of like dreaming.
You contemplating suicide?
You gonna jump off here?
Forget it.
I knew you wouldn't understand.
So, I guess you come here a lot.
Best place in town
to watch the sunset.
Look at that.
I ain't never really watched
the sun set before.
So, tell me something.
When can we get together again?
'Cause I was thinking maybe we could-
Surprise me.
Pastor preached a good service today.
What's your brother in there doing?
I don't know.
He wouldn't let me in there either.
Lordy mercy.
I can't remember when you last helped me
with the laundry. What's going on?
If you wanted a man to take you
someplace special...
where would that place be?
You met somebody.
I didn't say all that.
What's she like?
Damn! Female intuition.
Well?
Can't get a take on her,
you know?
One minute she's dissing me,
giving me a hard time.
Next minute she's showing me things
I ain't never seen before.
You like her, don't you?
Maddog took me on a picnic once.
Couldn't afford a blanket, so we used
a sheet, kind of like this one.
I believe that's the day
I fell in love with him.
Something special about picnics.
What we got here, man?
- Hotel Alexander?
- Ain't nothing.
- Smells good.
- Thanks, man.
Save some of that for me.
I'm gonna go change, all right?
All right.
Mama, what are you doing?
Mom, I made this for you!
- Stop it! I just bought that shit!
- With drug money.
How do you know I didn't get it
the honest way? How do you know that?
Every time you come out,
I pray it's gonna be different.
But it's always the same.
Not the roast, Mama.
I spent $25 on that roast.
What are you doing?
I spent a hundred dollars on that shit!
A hundred dollars
to make you happy, Mama.
Drug money.
I'll die-
You hear me?
I'll die before I feed my family
with that money.
And if you ever bring it in my house
again, the doors will be locked.
Now I see
how a man could beat you.
I knew Maddog's ghost was
somewheres to be found...
but I had no idea
it was in my own house.
Fuck!
Get out of the fucking car!
Gimme this-
Help, please!
Nice, Joshua.
Real nice.
What you looking for?
- What you willing to give?
- Two-fifty.
Are you crazy?
You got a dent in the back,
you broke the window-
This is an everyday thing
for me here. Done deal.
So, what's up with this flak?
You been thinking about
what we talked about?
Yeah, nigger,
and I done told you I got a gig.
What? That penny-ante shit?
That ain't a gig.
What you're out there
doing on the street is hustling.
Look where you're standing.
This is a gig.
- I ain't impressed.
- Man, we got other things going.
Do one or two more jobs
like this, man, and you're hooked.
I could do ten of these
motherfuckers a day, man.
Don't even worry about it, though.
I'm gonna hook you up.
- You gonna hook it up?
- Oh, yeah.
All right, nigger.
This ride's on me.
Jason, what are you doing?
You said "surprise me."
Well, I didn't mean for you
to go steal no bus.
Oh, this bus belongs to us
for the day.
My man hooked this up.
Come on.
I'm gonna take you to a special place.
I don't know about this.
Jason, you sure about this?
That's the problem.
I can't see nothing.
You're okay.
Jason, if you don't hurry up
and take this thing off me...
I'm gonna-
Oh, man.
Damn, it's quiet out here.
I should've brought my radio.
No, it's not quiet.
It's full of music.
Just listen.
Come on.
I'm in Paris.
I'm standing
in the grandest hotel...
wearing a flawless gown...
and it's fuchsia...
with emeralds and rhinestones...
with a long, long train.
Be careful.
Don't step on it.
And all the men are checking me out
'cause I'm fine.
And all the women
are green with envy.
And then way across the room...
I see-
You see me?
I'm wearing a-
I'm wearing a tuxedo...
and I'm a prince.
Fuck it, I'm Prince Charming.
And I'm checking you out.
Why do you always do that?
Girl, you know what they say..
the bigger the titty,
the bigger the tip.
Girl, my titties are so sore.
Your brother be sucking on these things
like he's breast-feeding.
Sounds romantic.
We got it like that.
So, Miss Girl...
what's going on
with your love life?
Come on now, give it up.
Give up the 411.
We went to the bayou.
- The bayou?
- Mm-hmm.
Whatever.
Well, what you all did
at the bayou?
We walked...
and we talked...
and he washed my feet.
What, girl?
I'd just die for a nigger
to wash these feet.
Yes, girl, I know.
And then he laid me down...
and he rubbed my head
so gently.
Lyric...
you didn't make love?
"Come live with me
and be my love...
and we will soon
the pleasures prove...
of golden sands
and crystal brooks...
silken lines
and silver hooks."
Go on, girl.
John Donne, 1572-1631.
- Marti, you know what?
- What?
There could be someone out there
who could give you the same thing.
Miss Girl, please.
A man that's better
than Alonzo?
I don't think so.
I
Know I've been changed
You see that
Good Lordy
What up?
So I hear you're a fool
who ain't afraid to bleed.
Josh ain't to be flexed with.
That motherfucker got heart.
Remember I told you about the time
we was in the joint...
and that motherfucker beat down four
fools who was trying to jack my shit.
Straight up.
I'm down with the thug life.
From what I hear, you down
with the petty drug life.
With me, you could be making
three G's in one night.
- What you know about that?
- Nothing.
I'm listening.
Bank-jacking.
- Easy as taking candy from a baby.
- Yes, sir.
- Straight up, dog.
- What you need me for?
Need you?
Nigger, I don't need you.
I'm just doing this
as a favor for my boy...
and it's only 'cause he say
he owe you.
Yeah, well, I'm gonna
think about it.
Do me a favor.
While you think about it...
why don't all of y'all get your
broke asses the fuck outta my face.
Come on.
Can't you see I'm trying
to catch the Holy Ghost?
Amazing grace
How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch
It was God's amazing grace
that saved a wretch like me
No matter what
my situation may be
It's everything
Just like Alonzo said- we ain't making
no money. You can't even win this.
I told you I don't wanna hear
that motherfucker's name again.
Man, you tripping.
Let's go.
- Still losing.
- Fuck it. I won.
What the hell wrong with you? You didn't
win that. Gimme my prize back.
- Fuck!
- What the fuck you doing?
You gonna get us all arrested.
You're some simple
motherfuckers.
Everything
Well, don't be scared.
You scared? I'll take care of you.
I can take care of myself
just fine, thank you.
Yeah, but I'll
take care of you better.
- Oh, you think so?
- I know it.
- Oh, shit.
- Sorry.
Yo, what up, Jay?
I've been looking all over
for you, man.
- What's your name, baby?
- Lyric. This is my brother, Josh.
That's a beautiful name.
Oh, this ride is cool.
Lyric, I told you.
Hey, man, what are you doing?
Jason, what's wrong
with your brother?
Stop it. Stop it.
- Get me outta here.
- Lyric, it's all right.
- Leave me alone.
- Josh, I told you, leave her alone.
Hey, wait up.
Where you going?
- Get your hands off me.
- What the fuck is your problem?
- What? What's wrong?
- Get your fucking hands off her.
Damn, Jay, what,
is the pussy that good, nigger?
- What?
- She take it up the ass?
What the fuck is
wrong with you, man? Huh?
Come on, man.
I was fucking joking, man.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You a motherfucking joke.
- Come on, man.
- Hey, hey.
All right, I'm sorry.
- You're a fucking clown, man.
- Jason, he apologized.
- No, he didn't mean it.
- Yes, he did.
How you know my brother's
telling the truth? You don't know that.
Hey, Jay, not in front
of my crew, man.
Crew?
You can't even get paid.
- I can get paid, man.
- You could get paid?
Show me, motherfucker,
you can get paid.
Give me my fucking gun, man.
You're tripping!
Yo, man, you know he out there.
That's your brother.
Let me tell you about love
Love is a hurtin' thing
Sometimes you gotta fight for it
Love will tell you
I dare you to cross that line
And you've got to say
I'll do that
Look love in the eye
And when you think love'll hurt ya
abuse and desert ya
It'll pick you up, lift you up
Turn you around
put a smile on your face
And leave a rainbow of joy
in your heart
Yes.
Yes.
Stay with me.
Here?
I'm so tired.
I just wanna...
sleep without
nightmares tonight.
Here's the door here.
- Ron, you cover the guard here.
- Right.
Josh, I want you to cover
the guard right here.
Both of y'all hold
everything else breathing.
Any fuckups between y'all two,
and we all dead.
Darryl, I want you to hit the tellers
and hit 'em quick.
I'll be making my way
back to that vault.
We get in...
we get our grift...
we get out.
Nobody get greedy,
nobody get caught.
I don't know, A-1.
I might feel like doing
a little bit of shopping.
Come here.
How about shopping for this gat?
You wanna pay that price?
Come on, nigger, get that shit
the fuck outta my face.
Now let's get down to business.
I'm ready to get paid.
Look, I'm the chief...
and you an Indian.
And that mean no one getting paid
till I say so.
102 JAMZ, my man, Brad...
better known as Scarface,
kicking that phat one right there-
You cool?
- Yeah, I'm cool.
- You better be...
'cause we in there at 9:30,
not 9:29...
not 9:31, 9:30.
You wait long, nigger,
you wait wrong.
What you looking
at my sister for?
Your sister?
Well, she sure is fine.
You know, I might have to tell
my brother to step aside.
Oh, is that right?
Didn't I tell you
to put that down?
Hardhead.
Why do you like
planes so much?
There was this cat
named Old Man Johnson.
Maddog used to take us
to his field.
He used to water the wild flowers
with his fire plane.
I used to think it was magic.
Used to call him "Rainmaker."
He died though.
Jason, there's something I need
to tell you about your brother.
My brother?
He's gonna rob a bank
tomorrow with them.
"With them"?
Who's "them"?
My brother and his crew.
Don't cross Alonzo.
Baby, I'm just gonna
talk to Josh.
You know, I stopped dating
guys in the ward...
'cause I was tired of wondering...
if I was gonna find them
in a body bag.
Promise me all you're
gonna do is talk.
I promise.
It's time for us to get
on that bus anyway.
What?
I'm just- It's time to stop watching
them buses and get on one.
Where will we go?
Where do you want to go?
I want to go everywhere!
When can we leave?
When you wanna leave?
Jason, why wait?
Why not tomorrow?
Meet me at the pier...
when the sun next leaves footprints
across the sky.
- How's the workout?
- Kicking.
I'll catch you.
What? You in a rush?
- You in a hurry?
- Yeah, man.
Where you going?
I got some business
to take care of, man.
What kind of business you got?
- It's just some ghetto shit, nigger.
- You trying to play me?
Come on, Jay.
What you talking about?
You think you're man enough
to rob a bank?
It was that bitch, wasn't it?
You ain't nothing.
Nothing!
You ain't no man.
You think I'm that stupid?
You know what? I ain't
in no hurry to go back to that cage.
I know no one else around here
believes in me...
but I always thought,
when it came down to it...
you would.
Can't rob no bank
without no piece, Jay.
What you waiting on?
Sing.
- Oh, say, can you see
- Come on, keep singing.
- By the dawn's early light
- Come on, come on.
Now hurry up with that money.
I don't hear y'all.
Get the combination.
Open this door.
Put your hands on your stomach
and stay down.
Get in the safe!
I said- Hey, come on.
Look at the time.
- I told you he was a hardhead.
- Watch your back.
Let's go.
We ain't got time for this.
Let's go. Come on.
Shit, man. Let's go.
We ain't got time.
Break it up in there.
Break it up now.
What the hell you doing?
Man thinks
he's taking his thing out?
- What about the money?
- Fuck the money! Let's go.
What do you mean, fuck the money?
What are you talking about, man?
Come on.
Shit.
The motherfucker's
still in there.
Give me your watch.
Give me your fucking watch!
Give me your watch, motherfucker!
You disrespecting me?
You dissing me, motherfucker?
Anybody asks you, you tell them
Jesse James robbed this motherfucker.
Get in the car.
Get in the fucking car.
Let's go.
Yo, Josh, dog,
we're gonna take you home, fix you up.
Wake up.
Wake the fuck up!
You ain't dead, is you?
No, you ain't dead.
Damn, you're fucked up.
Shit.
A-1, dog.
- Maybe this might wake you up.
- Shit.
Come on, man,
don't do that shit.
Put that shit down, man.
Put that shit down on the floor, man.
It ain't my fault.
It ain't my fucking fault, man.
- What are you talking about?
- Blame your bitch-ass sister.
Nigger, what the fuck does my sister
gotta do with this, fool?
Everything.
Everything, man.
She told my brother
what was going down.
She told my brother
about the bank robbery, man.
That's why I was late.
See, he was sweating me, man.
That's why I was late.
No, no, nigger.
You fucked up my money.
Your brother's
fucking my sister?
- I'm gonna fuck both of you all fools.
- Yeah, that's right.
Slow, nigger, piece...
No, man.
by piece.
Throw this motherfucker out
with the rest of the shit.
You bet, man.
Give me that motherfucking watch.
Fucking late nigger
gonna tell time?
Me and Lyric, we're just thinking
about getting on a bus and going.
We're just gonna go.
Your brother's gonna miss you.
He's gonna be all right.
Mama, why can't you
just be happy for me?
I am.
Oh, Lord, Jesus Christ.
Oh, Lord.
Alonzo did this to you, man?
Motherfuckers, man!
Come on, I'll get you
to the hospital, man.
You know I'll get you to the hospital.
I'll take care of you. Come on.
Come on, baby. You know
I'll get you there. Come on.
Come on, stand up,
stand up, stand up.
I'm sorry.
Man, I'm ready to take that buster out,
and he can't foul, man.
- Why'd you let him go like that?
- No shit.
I told y'all, I'm gonna
make that fool suffer.
If his brother got
in my business-
- Bullshit, right?
- Keep the chains ready, fool.
I'll let y'all know when it's time
to buy his mama that black dress.
I'm ready for round two.
Hook me up.
- Hold this.
- Yeah.
Which one do you think is bigger...
this gat or my dick?
Definitely, it's the gat, fool.
This is for my brother.
Fucker.
Fuck you.
"Come live with me
and be my love...
and we will some
new pleasures prove...
of golden sands
and crystal brooks...
with silken lines...
and silver hooks."
We're not going, are we?
You got in the middle,
didn't you?
It's my family. They-
My brother. They need me.
No, I need you!
- Lyric, you know-
- Shut up. Shut up.
- See, you don't-
- Shut up!
You know...
I guess that's why I spend
all of my life fantasizing-
'cause I just couldn't stand
this ghetto shit.
God.
Jason, I am trying to love you.
But I don't want my heart broken.
And that's exactly
what you're gonna do...
if you keep trying to save a brother
that don't want to be saved.
What kind of hold
does he have on you, huh?
Why do you keep having
these nightmares?
You might as well just go ahead.
My life is fucked up.
It's been fucked up ever since-
Since what?
Since-
When we was little...
one night,
me and Josh was in bed...
we heard this real loud noise.
So me and Josh got up
to see what was going on.
Daddy...
had come to the door.
He was all drunk...
and he was beating on Mama.
- Get out of here, boy!
- I tried- I wanted to stop it.
And Josh went-
Josh went...
and got Mama's gun.
Mama screamed, and she told him,
"Don't kill anybody."
So I tried to take it from him.
- No, baby! No, baby! No!
- Give me the gun.
When I tried to take it
from him...
Daddy came rushing towards me.
And before I could do anything,
I just turned around.
I didn't mean to shoot him.
I just want my daddy back.
Jason, God.
Oh, Jason, it's not your fault.
It's not your fault.
Listen to me.
You were just trying to be a hero.
Just like you're doing
right now.
But sometimes heroes
have to walk away.
Walk away, Jason.
Or we can't be together.
That's the day he came home.
There should've been a band
and a job waiting for him.
I guess it's easy to walk around
with blinders on...
and not notice the sacrifices
people are making for you.
You don't owe Joshua
and me nothing.
You hear me?
There are no debts...
in this house.
Nobody killed Maddog.
He died in that war.
They just didn't bury him.
I want you to go to her, baby.
Be happy.
Alonzo, man, why don't you
just tell us who jumped your ass...
so we can take care
of those busters?
'Cause I told you, I tripped.
You tripped off what, man?
Transco Tower?
- Shut up, Darryl.
- I don't play that trip shit, man.
I told you, girl.
I knew you was
gonna get cussed out.
Alonzo don't play that.
You had no business telling Jason
about that bank robbery.
Just forget it, girl, okay?
You got every right
to see that nigger...
if you want to.
I just wish you'd get up, girl.
Stop moping around here and call him.
I can't.
It's like Jason
never even happened.
But you know it did.
Oh, Miss Girl, I know...
that...
Alonzo's not perfect.
But I'm gonna hold onto him...
'cause it's all I got.
The wards ain't full of Jasons.
What you found-
What you found was quiet...
in a world full of thunder.
I ain't got no choice
but to listen to it.
You do.
Yo, Marti, bring your
fine ass down here, girl.
Love calls.
Jason. Come on, man.
Joshua's gone crazy.
- Come on, man.
- Let's just go.
Who knows what he's all gonna do?
Come on, he's got a gun.
You got any jimmies?
No. No, but that's all right.
That's all right.
- All right for who?
- All right for us.
Now why do you have to go
and do that? Damn.
Don't start the fire
unless you could hose me down.
Baby, come on.
Get off me.
What? You gonna butter the biscuit
when it pops out of the oven?
Biscuit?
Ain't no biscuits, girl.
I didn't think so, okay?
I hope he don't get to Alonzo
before we do, man. He might kill him.
We'll be back
in a few minutes.
Alonzo, watch that other jaw.
- Come on, man.
- Come on, man, just drive on through.
Damn.
Fuck.
Fuck.
I got this college girl-
I know her name.
Come on, baby.
Come on.
I'm gonna find you.
Where's Alonzo?
He ain't in here.
Why you taking Jay away from me?
Don't you know he's all I got?
Josh, don't.
That's why you can't have him.
You hear me?
You can't fucking have him!
Me and Jason- we're over.
You're lying.
Why you gotta lie to me?
You think he better than me?
I knew you'd come!
You're always still
pick up the pieces.
You seen them two niggers
I got downstairs?
Yeah, I seen them, man.
I took care of that.
All we gotta do now
is wait for Alonzo.
You ain't gotta go
nowhere, man.
You're right, Josh.
I ain't gotta go nowhere.
Just let her go.
I can't let her go, Jay.
We gonna use her as bait.
But she ain't got nothing
to do with this, Josh.
We can take Alonzo together-
me and you.
Why you still talking about her?
What is this?
You fucking putting her above me?
You're putting her above me, man.
No, man.
Shit. What about me, man?
What about me?
What about you?
It's always been about you. I spent
my whole fucking life for you.
I can't do that no more, man.
Oh, I'm tired of you telling me
I'm fucking up, man.
Shit. 'Cause
I took care of this.
So fuck you, man.
You fucked up!
This shit is fucked up.
I'm tired of your shit.
I don't need this no more.
I don't need you. I don't need you.
Fuck you.
I don't give a fuck about you.
Fuck this.
Don't make me do this again.
Come on, let her go.
Don't make me
do this again, man.
She taking you away
from me, man?
Well, I ain't got nothing.
I love you, man.
Love me, man?
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.
Shoot me.
I'm ready to go.
Come on, get up.
You gotta get up
'cause we gotta go. Come on.
I'm sorry, man.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.
Jay, you're all I got.
I love you, Jason.
You can't go, man.
You can't leave me.
Shit.
It was Joshua, man.
He shot Lyric,
then he did himself.
Oh, shit.
We have a gunshot victim.
We'll be transporting to your location.
