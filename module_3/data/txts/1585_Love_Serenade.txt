<i>Vissi d'arte...</i>
<i>vissi d'amore...</i>
<i>non feci mai male ad anima viva!</i>
<i>Con man furtiva...</i>
<i>quante miserie conobbi aiutai.</i>
<i>Sempre con fe' sincera...</i>
<i>la mia preghiera ai santi tabernacoli salì.</i>
<i>Sempre con fe' sincera...</i>
<i>diedi fiori agli altar.</i>
<i>Nell'ora del dolore...</i>
<i>perché, perché, Signore...</i>
<i>perché me ne rimuneri così?</i>
<i>Diedi gioielli della Madonna al manto...</i>
<i>e diedi il canto agli astri, al ciel...</i>
<i>che ne ridean più belli.</i>
<i>Nell'ora del dolore...</i>
<i>perché, perché, Signor...</i>
<i>aaah...perché me ne rimuneri così?</i>
Yeah, Mexico's a nice place...
but I gotta get outta here...
I should've been back
in New York a week ago.
Alright, boys...take it away.
Carlos...this is entirely up to you...
If you're any kind of a lawyer at all...
...you ought to be able to figure some way
to get Miss Fuller back into the United States.
I can't understand it...
Louise Fuller...the greatest opera singer
in the world...
How could they put a woman like that
out of your country?
Well, they did.
She overstayed her time...
...and the immigration authorities say
she can't come back...
...until she gets a quota-number
from Australia.
Oh, yes...she's from Australia.
And somebody talked her into
the idea of hanging out here...
until her quota-number comes up.
So here she is...
and no quota-number in sight!
I've worked every angle...
...but I'm just a press agent,
not a miracle man.
And you expect ME to be one?
Yeah!
Well, what are you waiting for?
Señor...the photograph of Louise Fuller...
We might have one?
Oh, sure...sure...
Sure, she has a golden voice.
Yep...I've been telling that to the world
for years.
There you are...especially autographed
for you.
"Sincerely, Louise Fuller."
Oh, you very good fellow!
<i>O sole mia...</i>
Whoever told her
to come to Mexico?
Those parasites she's got,
hanging around her.
Just promoted themselves
into trip, that's all.
Did you ever see them?
No.
You have a treat coming.
What time is it?
Oh, you've got plenty of time...
Come on, sit down
and have a drink.
That's a good idea.
I need one.
What about you?
Alright, I'll have one drink.
Carlos...If Miss Fuller doesn't
get back to the United States...
...it's going to break her heart.
You know that Song Festival
I was telling you about?
She was right in the middle
of rehearsals
when the immigration office
pounced on her.
She wouldn't have cared
for herself...
But she was putting on that festival
for the grandest old guy in the world...
...her uncle Walter...
...a man who scraped and saved for years
to make her an opera singer.
She promised herself that one day
she'd pay him back.
He's a conductor, you see,
and a composer...
But the poor old devil
never had a chance.
This was supposed to be
his big chance.
This festival of his, and...
Now everything's ruined
and she can't get back.
We've been here for weeks...
and where's the quota-number?
That's what I'd like to know!
Where is the quota-number?
I'm tired of sitting around here...
waiting...just waiting.
We may never get back.
But, my darling...
It is lovely here...
- So romantic!
- Rrrrromantic!
Don't you ever think of anything else?
I just spoke to the Consul.
Any news?
Yes...he expects to hear
from Australia today!
He said he's coming here
for the fiesta tonight...
...and he'll look us up!
Fiesta?
There's going to be a fiesta here..
right outside the window.
Who cares about a fiesta...
I'm going to send a telegram
to Uncle Walter...
...and tell him that we're leaving tomorrow...
so make all the plans!
Look...little number
I just picked up...
Think it'll do me any good?
Maybe in Scotland.
I wanted it for Mexico!
A double daiquiri please.
If you're not an Egyptian mummy...
I'll have a double daiquiri, please.
Boy!...A double daiquiri.
José...you should be a general!
Thank you, Señor.
If you weren't standing up...
I'd swear you were sitting on a horse.
Mr Hudson...if you would only
paint a picture of my baby.
Don't insult me, my friend...
I'm an artist...Up!
My baby...she is cute!
That's the trouble...I don't feel cute...
I must feel my subjects.
For my baby,
I will give you 6 drinks!
Not for 10,000, my friend...Up!
Si, Señor.
But you make my picture
for only 1 drink!
Yes, but you're an exciting subject.
Thank you Mr Hudson.
You have character.
Thank you!
You are strong!
Oh...Señor!
A born conqueror!
Oh, Mr Hudson...
You are truly a great artiste!
You said it!
There you are...come on Shylock...
pay me...one drink of tequila.
But you make me upside-down!
I draw them only as I see them my friend...
I'm a true artist!
Oh, no...I do not like this.
50 years from now,
you'll be proud to own it...
That's an early Hudson...Yes sir!
An early shaky Hudson.
This is an insult...
I am not upside-down!
I'm surprised at you, José...
That just shows how wrong you can be.
You see, any man
with a sensitive soul like yours...
Who's been reduced by life
to peddling drinks...
...must be upside-down...
Don't you see?
I see, Señor!
I see!
You are truly a great artiste!
I'm glad you see, I don't.
Hello.
You're wasting your time, sister,
I'm broke.
There you are, Señor!
Ah...the fruits of my labor.
To you, José...and to you
unfortunate lady...
...and to all your valiant tribe!
I'd like to buy one now.
Yeah...why?
Real human beings are rare...
When I meet one, I rejoice.
You've got hold of something there, sister...
you better hang on to it!
Hey, wait a minute...
Haven't I seen you somewhere before...
Aren't you on the stand
for "The Queen"?
The queen?
Yeah...that peacock
that floats around these grounds...
...with an army of sycophants
behind her.
Don't you know who she is?
I don't give hoot.
It's people like that, that give the human race
a bad name.
Oh, you're not serious...
you don't know her.
Oh, yes I do...
The world's full of her kind.
She's probably the widow
of some poor slave...
She reeks of gold.
Manufactures a throne of her own...
...and sits on it like a mighty queen...
...with the dregs of humanity
falling at her feet.
I'm sorry for you sister...
...you're even lower
than I thought you were.
take a tip, and get out...
you're made of sterner stuff.
Hi, amigo!
Telegram for you, Mr Hudson.
Thanks.
I'm going up to commune
with the Muse.
I don't want to be disturbed
under any condition.
Si Señor.
Have you ever communed
with the Muse?
No, Señor.
Poor boy!
My sister just had a baby.
Congratulations.
Oh, it was nothing...nothing at all!
He has paid his bill, or no?
No.
He must pay, or go!
Come in!
How you keeping?...Pull up a chair...
sit down...feast your soul.
I have come to see you
about the bill, Señor.
I'm surprised at you , innkeeper...
How can you think of bills
at a time like this, eh?
I must think of bills...
I am running a business here.
And running it badly...
if you don't mind my saying so.
Oh...you do not like the service...eh?
A successful manager doesn't keep
annoying his guests with trifles.
Trifles!
He does not pay his bill...
It is just a trifle!
Well, alright...
How about a picture in payment...?
Something..."impressionistic".
No, no no...
You have already made of me
one picture...
You make me look like a monkey.
Can I help it?
I will not permit you
to stay another minute!
Wait a minute...
Hold it! Hold it!
He's going to hit 'Top G'...
I want to hear it!
I do not care for the 'Top G'.
I will have you thrown out!
You have committed a sacrilege,
innkeeper...
You just have drowned out
the 'Top G' of an artist!
Just for that,
I won't pay you at all!
Sorry, pal!
Please apologise for me, too.
There's a lady here...
says she's also sorry.
Forget it pal...
It's only "The Queen."
She wouldn't know the difference.
I beg your pardon?!
Oh, I always talk to myself, "Queen".
"Queen"...why do you call me that?
It's just a little joke of my own...
What can I do for you?
Well...
I thought I would...sort of like
to hear your records.
I'm very fond of music, too.
Oh, yeah?!
Yes, I am.
By the way...have you any records
of Louise Fuller's?
Will you do me
a special favour?
Yes.
Never mention Louise Fuller's name
casually...
Always say it with reverence...
sort of...on your breath!
Oh...You admire her!
Look..."Queen"...if...
oh, what's the use...
You wouldn't understand.
Well, personally...
I think she's slipping.
Well, maybe there's hope for you yet...
you're so right, it'd painful.
In the last few year's Fuller's not only slipped,
she's come down with a crash!
You think so?!
I'm sure of it.
I've broken all her new records...
I can't stand them.
There's something gone
out of her voice.
She's probably too busy
making money.
This is one of her old ones.
Wait a minute.
There...that's the Fuller
that was great!
Full of warmth and fire!
Have you seen her recently?
No, I've never seen her.
Well the last time I saw her,
she looked like an old battleaxe.
Who cares?
Listen.
There he is...
Put him out.
He will not pay his bill.
Must you always interrupt me,
when I'm hobnobbing with the sublime...
You're the most inconsiderate creditor I've got!
Put him out!
And if he resists...
Arrest him!
Will you go, Señor?
Do you mind if I finish this first?
Oh...I think is beautiful!
You said it!
But I mind.
Yes, well...you would.
Still insist upon being a monkey, eh?
Well, you better listen to it anyway...
May do you some good.
Shut up!
Bravo, Señor...bravo!
Glad YOU appreciate it.
Innkeeper...that should have
melted the ice in your heart...
But I doubt it.
You see what I mean?
Now, Señor...will you please
pack and go!
Relax...relax!...
I'm already packed.
In fact, I'm ALWAYS packed.
Make yourself at home, gentlemen...
It takes me just about 75 seconds
to get out.
I've timed it...that's my average...
Although in Brazil once,
I did it just under a minute...
But that was on
a more urgent occasion.
If there's anything
I can do to help...
You know...lend you the money,
or something .
No, now...come, come Queen...
Don't start flaunting your wealth.
Well...I just wanted to help
if I could.
I generally earn my keep.
Perhaps Señor could earn it,
by doing a picture of the lady?
Oh, so you're an artist?
Yes, why not?
Innkeeper...you're positively brilliant.
That's fine...
You may send ME the bill.
Wait a minute...
we'll do the picture first.
There's no hurry.
I might change my mind.
Stand over there.
Over there?
Any particular pose?
No...head slightly up.
You boys can make
all the conversation you want.
You want bother me at all.
This is silly...
we could have waited.
I want you to see what you're getting
for your money...you may not like it...
"Queen".
It doesn't matter...
The deal is made.
You have ethics!
Amuses you, doesn't it?
It's apparently a word
about which YOU know nothing.
You wrong me, "Queen"...
I'm full of ethics.
Mine are of a very peculiar nature...
Nobody seems to understand them.
Yes, I can imagine.
How long is this going to take?
Not long...You're very easy to do.
Thank you.
There we are...
A magnificent likeness!
Already? You're quick.
But this face is a blank!
Sorry, "Queen", I draw only
what I see.
Clever, aren't you?!
Well, I guess the deal's off, gents.
Yes, and you are leaving this place
at once!
Don't be obvious, Innkeeper...
bring my bags down.
You can see how important it is
that she gets back to the States.
Sorry, Miss Woods, there's nothing
can be done about it.
There won't be a quota-number
available for another year.
Perhaps two.
It will be impossible for her
to enter the United States until then.
That's a fine kettle of fish.
If you don't mind...I have
a little suggestion to make.
- For the way out.
- You have?
Yes...You see, it is like this...
If Miss Fuller, she is married
to an American citizen...
She can return to the United States,
without trouble.
That's a brilliant idea.
But she's not married.
Aah...that is where I come in.
I was beginning to wonder.
I can supply someone, who,
for a consideration, of course...
...will be willing to marry Miss Fuller.
You can, eh?
Yes.
And he'd be willing to...
Naturally.
Naturally, there would be
an understanding
that as soon as she returns
to the United States...
...this person would divorce her.
See how simple it is?
Excuse me, Señor...
I feel a little faint..
Oh, nothing...nothing...these spells
come on me now and then.
Please, Miss Fuller...
Just one song.
Oh, no...I couldn't sing tonight.
You are leaving tomorrow
and we will never see you.
Well, I can't...
I'd like to...but...
Hi ya, Queen!
I believe I will, gentlemen...
One song!
Something in Spanish, perhaps?
"Siboney"...they'll love it!
That's very fortunate, because it's
the only song in Spanish, I know.
Send me the orchestra leader, quickly.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Miss Louise Fuller...
the famous prima donna...
...is going to sing for us.
Hey...Louise Fuller's here...she's going to sing...
what do you know about that?
Yes...maybe now you can judge
how badly she's slipped.
Ladies and gentlemen...
I take the greatest pleasure in introducing...
Miss Louise Fuller!
<i>Siboney, yo te quiero, yo me muero...
por tu amor...</i>
<i> Siboney, en tu boca la miel puso su dulzor.</i>
<i>Ven a mí, que te quiero...</i>
<i>y que todo tesoro </i>
<i>eres tú para mi. </i>
<i>Siboney, al arrullo de la palma
pienso en tí.</i>
<i> Siboney, de mi sueños...</i>
<i>¿si no oyes la queja de mi voz? </i>
<i>Siboney, si no vienes,
me moriré de amor.</i>
<i>Siboney, de mi sueños</i>
<i>te espero con ansia en mi caney</i>
<i>Porque tú eres el dueño de mi amor</i>
Not bad, eh, Bert?
<i>Oye el eco de mi canto de cristal.</i>
<i>No se pierda por entre el rudo manigual.</i>
Hey, toots...how about
"Minnie the Moocher"?
Yeah...give us
"Minnie the Moocher"!
You boys weren't very kind
to that lady.
Shut your puss, stoop!
Hey...
C'mon Butch...
let's get him.
Well, it's hopeless.
No luck at all?
I've been in touch
with everyone...
I think you better wire Uncle Walter
to call off the rehearsal...
Oh, no!
There just isn't a chance of your
getting back to the States.
But there must be some way?
No, there isn't...
so forget it.
But you could put the festival on for him
some other time....
Say in a year or two.
But he's an old man...
No, I don't want to wait
any longer.
Besides, I've been savng money for years...
just to make this possible.
It's the only thing
he ever wanted.
Yes, I know.
Don't you see...
We've GOT to do something for him.
Well, of course,
there is ONE way out...
Take the suggestion of that attorney
I spoke to last night...
Yes, I know!...I thought it was
an outrageous idea, too.
It still is.
I suppose you could be married and divorced...
and no one need ever know.
Yes, I know...but it's crazy...
I wouldn't even think of it!
Sorry, amigo, but you came
to the wrong hombré.
Yes sir!  I've done a lot of things
in my time, to pay my way...
But boy, you're asking
too much!
But Jim, soon as you want,
you can get the divorce.
Listen...there's a little matter
of principle involved here.
Someday I'll explain it to you.
But all this money...$2,000
when you are married.
5,000 when you are divorced!
Sorry, amigo...it doesn't
even cause a flutter.
But this woman...
she is very desirable.
You're just about 12 hours too late.
I've already met
a desirable woman.
Yes...popped pot of the blue,
last night.
But this one...
she is very beautiful!
Say..amigo...
What have you been eating?
Why?
Never mind...maybe I'm wrong.
Well, so long, pal...
See you when I get out.
Listen..you're a nice guy
and a swell lawyer.
Someday I might even pay you
for your services.
Oh...thank you!
But don't count on it!
This is a fine place
to find a husband.
They ought to raise a very good brand here...
Excellent training!
Boo!
Oh, Marianne, I'm so afraid!
This man might be dreadful!
Well, if he is, we'll shop
somewhere else.
You must ask him a great many questions
about himself.
I've got a hunch
you'll like him.
You don't know him, do you?
Oh, no, no...it's just a hunch!
Jimmy...please...
Won't you listen to me?
Will you go away, amigo...
The wind's still in my favour.
Jimmy...here she is!
Will you go home!?
Jimmy!
Hello, Queen!
Is this the woman?
Yes!
Amigo...you should have told me...
This is an old friend of mine!
The one that popped out of the blue,
last night.
Come in, ladies..come in...
Have a seat!
How did you manage
to get in here?
Influence.
Oh...it was nothing...
Nothing at all...
The señor got into a little fight
at the fiesta.
Probably a drunken brawl
over a woman.
Doggone it, "Queen"...you hit it
right on the nose!
Can we get down to business, now?
Oh, yes...let's get down
to business.
Now, look, "Queen"...if I understand
the proposition...
You want to marry me?
I certainly don't want to.
Well, let's not get technical...
That's the general idea, though?
Now before we go ahead...
...you'll have to answer some questions
about yourself
I'LL have to answer
some questions?!
Certainly! You don't expect me to take a wife
without knowing something about her...
After all, a man's got to be
careful nowadays.
This man's crazy...let's go.
Please...Señorita!
Why should I answer any questions?
Oh...a stubborn streak too, eh?
I'm glad I found that out in time!
I'm NOT stubborn!
So, what are you afraid of?
I'm not afraid of anything.
Go on...ask your questions...
Because I've got a few
that I want to ask YOU!
That's the spirit!
Now...were you ever married before?
No.
Do you believe in
"the sanctity of marriage"?
Naturally.
Are you willing to guarantee fidelity
during our married life?
- Come on, Marianne...let's get out...
- Oh, I know that's asking a little too much!
Do you realise that you're
being paid for this...
..and after today I'll probably
never see you again?
Nevertheless, "Queen"...
I must have fidelity.
Yes...even from a distance...
I'm an old-fashioned guy.
Of course, I might allow you to go out
with the boys just once in a while...
- But dinner, or something like that...
- YOU might allow ME!...
What will YOU be doing?
Now, "Queen"...you can trust ME!
Oh yes, with that awful woman
you were fighting about last night, I suppose.
Insulting my women, eh?
That's a fine way to start!
I can see right now...you're going to be
impossible to live with.
"To live with!"...
Do you think, for an instant...?
Oh, you're going to get tough
about it, eh?
Well, I can be tough, too.
Listen...the first thing you do
is get rid of those dummers
that are hanging around with you.
I beg your pardon...
they're my friends.
You can get those hand-kissers in Paris
for a dime a dozen!
I can see right now that you've never known
any decent people in your whole life.
You've been living like a tramp!
You judge everybody else
by yourself.
I won't have you dictating to me...
I simply won't!
You're gonna throw things, eh?
I'll go out with whomever I please!...
...you understand...
...and please keep your hands
off of me!
Oh...a fighter, too, eh?
- I'll cure you of that!
- I'll teach you how to behave!...
You ought to stay right here
in jail and rot...
And don't forget you're being paid
for this job...
...and too much...
You great big hullaballoo!
We'd better start figuring out
what your fee is.
It looks like you're gonna get paid.
Oh, not much, Jimmy.
Does it say that he's not to be paid 5,000...
until the divorce?
Yes...if it isn't within the first 6 months...
he doesn't get paid at all.
That's good.
When we finish here, I'm going to send a telegram
to Uncle Walter that we're leaving immediately.
Miss Fuller!
Oh, I beg pardon!
He says...do you take this man
to be your husband?
Yes, yes...of course!
We might fly.
I want to pay that innkeeper,
right away.
He says...Do you take this woman
to be your wife?
Oh, yes...sure...sure!
I'll owe him about 90 bucks.
He says you both are married!
Thank you...thank you very much.
It is finished!
C'mon...let's go to the bank
and get the money.
Now, boys...all the way though
I want you more "rubato"!
Are you sure you have enough of this
for 40 costumes?
Oh, yes, Madam...plenty.
This is for the "Serenade" isn't it?
Yes.
I want a sample made of this
and bring it down tomorrow, please.
Well, maestro...how goes it?
As well as can be expected.
I heard the song you wrote...
it's beautiful.
- Thank you.
- What are you calling it?
"Our Song".
- Not much of a title I'm afraid.
- It'll do.
Oh, what a night it's going to be!
It's a lucky thing that quota-number
came in on time.
If it hadn't, we'd have had to
give up the whole thing.
Why, you're here every day,
aren't you?
Yes... We're from the music studio,
upstairs.
And we like to hear you sing.
Do YOU study singing?
Yes...but we like to hear YOU sing.
Alright, darling...you may!
Can I go get my friend?
Yes! Run along...why not?
Come on...we'll go inside
and see Uncle Walter.
Hello, Uncle Walter!
Hello, everybody.
I brought a lot of singers
with me.
Oh. Louise...I told you not to come.
Oh, but darling, I'm crazy about your new song,
and I'm longing to try it.
Why...I brought my own audience
with me...See?
Well, boys...it looks as if
we won't be needing you.
Better go out
and take a smoke.
Aren't they charming?
Yes...she said I could bring ya.
Gee...that's swell.
Say...wait for me!
We're coming, too!
Come on!
Doesn't look like I have much choice,
does it?
Look what's coming?
I hope we shall do as well
at the "Festival"!
Look who's here...
what's the matter, darling?...you're crying.
I fell.
You fell?...oh, that's a shame!
What've you got here?
It's a little wooden dolly whistle.
A whistle?...We'd like to hear him,
wouldn't we?
Yes!
He can't...he's broke.
What a shame!  And he's such
a nice little fellow, too.
Why, I know a story about a little boy,
just like that!
Would you like to hear it?
Yeah...that's why I came here.
- Would YOU?
- Yes!
Right...go over there
and sit down now...
Make yourselves very comfortable.
And I'll tell you all about it.
Ready?
Why, once I had a toy...
A little wooden boy...
<i>Who'd whistle when I wound him up...</i>
<i>I would listen to him all day.</i>
<i>And, athwart his hips
he'd pucker up his lips...</i>
<i>No trace of fear was in his eyes...</i>
<i>He was much more brave than I.</i>
<i>Could he say I love you...</i>
<i>Or the birds he could do...</i>
<i>Was to whistle it...</i>
<i>But the tune would start...</i>
<i>Growing into his heart.</i>
<i>When the world passed him by...</i>
<i>Would he sit down and cry?...</i>
<i>No...he's whistle it.</i>
<i>So, you'll learn what to do...</i>
<i>When it happens to you...</i>
<i>Do your best...your song...</i>
<i>Whistling too.</i>
<i>Then he'd say "I love you"...</i>
<i>Or the birds he could do...</i>
<i>Was to whistle it...</i>
<i>But the tune would start...</i>
<i>Growing into his heart.</i>
<i>When the world passed him by...</i>
<i>Would he sit down and cry?</i>
<i>No, he'd whistle it!</i>
<i>So, you'll learn what to do...</i>
<i>When it happens to you</i>
<i>Do your best...your song...</i>
<i>...Whistling too!</i>
<i>This is where the story ends...</i>
<i>You must remember this.</i>
Has Miss Fuller returned?
No.
You see how clear it is.
Yes, I see, but if I'm Capricorn...
I really shouldn't start my novel
until next year, should I?
Oh...goodness, no!
Thank you so much.
Ah...Marianne..
She's not home yet!
Stop fretting...she's driving
through the park.
Here's a sample of the sword they delivered
for the Ferrara number.
Marianne why don't you
talk to Louise...
...and get her to go away
to the seashore for a while.
I shan't need her for a week.
The seashore is very bad
for my sciatica.
That's why we can't go...
The seashore is bad for her sciatica.
Hello everybody...I've never known
New York to be so divine!
Hello, Uncle Walter,
how are you?
Shall we dress, dear?
Don't bother...we'll go to that
little Swedish place.
Wake up!
Oh, now...that's not nice, "Queen"...
Never startle a strong man
out of a sound sleep...
It's dangerous!
What do you mean,
by coming here?
Say, I was just looking at this picture of you,
when you were a youngster.
Lovely girl...
Wonder what happened to her?
Will you please explain
your presence here?
Does a husband have to explain
why he comes home?
I had trouble enough
with you butler...
Finally had to show him
our marriage certificate.
You're forcing me
to have you put out.
I wouldn't do that
if I were you, "Queen"...
It's liable to raise
too much of a rumpus.
Yes...The first thing you know...
the newspapers might hear of it.
Have to do something about this bed...
it's much too comfortable.
And won't your friends be shocked?
Think of it...
"LOUISE FULLER MARRIES FOR CONVENIENCE"
If you have any idea
of blackmailing me...
Oh, what a nasty word!
Why did you come here?
- You really want to know?
- Yes.
I came here, because
I got to worrying about you.
Got to worry whether you
were being faithful to me.
Got so I couldn't sleep nights.
You're being ridiculous,
aren't you?
Am I?
You want to know something?
Before I met you, I didn't care
whether school kept or not, but...
Now I have a responsibility...
I'm a husband.
And I like it.
Will you do me a favour and
don't trouble yourself about ME.
What I can't figure out,
is why you did it.
You're a sensible woman...
Marrying me was a little crazy.
What's the answer?
None of your business!
Cigarette?...Oh, I forgot...
you're an opera singer.
You had to get back here...
and it must have been to some man.
Well, I might as well tell you...
I have to look him over
before I give my approval.
Approval?!
You don't think I'd let my wife
marry anyone without my OK?
You're not making any sense,
and I'd appreciate it if you'd leave.
Alright...if you insist upon
throwing your own husband out...
Hungry and penniless.
You see...I came to stay.
What did you with the $2,000
I gave you?
Say...I almost forgot...
I bought you a wedding present...
Wait a minute...
Original Gauguin sketch...
I picked through...Look!
Why...how much did you pay for that?
Like it, eh? Went for a song...
$1,800.
$1,800...do you mean to say...?
It was a steal!
I'll give you a cheque
for the amount.
There you go...
spoiling everything.
I suppose you've got too much principle
to take this?
One of these days, I'll teach you the difference,
between earning your keep, and being kept.
It's yours if you want it.
You have some money coming to you
when we're divorced.
Sorry, "Queen", but I'm afraid
I can't take it...
Because chances are
we'll never be divorced.
I think I'd better go...it seems to be
getting chillier in here, every minute.
Why it takes her so long...
I'm getting hungry!
She's probably got a man in there.
If she has...I kill myself.
I'm sorry, darling, I couldn't carry
more than 50lb of ice in this suitcase...
Next time I come,
I'll bring my trunk.
Who are you?
Why, that's obvious, my friend...
I'm the ice-man!
Keep looking at that sketch I brought you...
It's got something to say to you.
Goodbye, Mrs Hudson.
Goodbye, Mr Hudson.
That's a nasty habit
you're getting into...
I'll have to do something
about it.
Be seeing you.
Poor boy!
Who is this man?
You're quite right, Uncle Walter...
We'd better go to the seashore for a while.
- Who is this man?
- We'll leave at once!
I am talking to you!
You make arrangements, Marianne.
- Who is this man?
Didn't you hear him...
He's the ice-man!
Oh...I kill myself!
You still here?
Whatever made you suggest
coming to this place?
I thought you'd like it.
Why don't you go out for a walk?
You haven't budged out of this room
in over a week.
Oh...it's dull here.
Hank arranged a couple of interviews...
but I told him to cancel them.
I'm glad you did.
Your husband telephoned today.
Oh...he did?!
Yes...he's here, you know.
He is?!
He calls every day.
I told him, if he didn't stop annoying us,
we'd turn him over to the police.
That was alright, wasn't it?
Oh yes...Of course...Naturally!
I wonder how he found out
where we were.
Can't imagine.
The next time he calls,
I'll talk to him myself.
I'll give him a piece of my mind.
I don't blame you.
This small trinket
was left at the desk for you.
My goodness...what's this?
Maybe it's your quota-number.
Say...there's a prince stopping
at this hotel...
He's from India...
one of those maharajahs.
Now, if I can get him to have
his picture taken with you...
I can start a romance that would...
Don't be ridiculous, Hank!
Hank...you're getting desperate.
I thought it was a good idea.
I've got an idea for a story that will land us
on the front page of every newspaper.
You have?
All you've got to do
is drown three people.
You're wrong, mister...
you're dead wrong!
Wrong eh? The trouble with most countries today
is they try and make the switch too abruptly.
You can't change a social order
without first changing the viewpoint of the people.
That takes at least three generations.
Sit down...let's talk it over!
I'm sorry, mister...
I can't do that.
Come on, pal...
sit down, will you?
Now, look...
As I understand the thing...
any government that...
For two, please.
Look me up on the beach some time,
my friend...we'll really go to town.
Yes, sir.
I've just got one phone call to make
and I'll be right back.
What are we doing here?
Hank said it was important.
Where's Hank?
Wait a minute, "Queen".
Please don't go...Didn't you get
my note of apology?
I wasn't interested.
You should be...apologies are rare
in my life.
I'm overcome!
- What'll you have?
- Nothing.
A martini, with the speed
of an antelope.
Yes, Sir.
I did say some pretty bad things, at that,
and I'm sorry.
They were stupid.
I was just trying to hit home.
Maybe I shouldn't have used
a sledgehammer!
I suppose being kind to people
is no longer a virtue.
Now, come on, "Queen",
you've got good eyes.
Pretty ones, too.
Why don't you use them
to see with?
Apparently yours are much sharper.
What do you see, that I don't?
Right now, all I can see is you.
The trouble is, I can't see you...
They've got you covered up
under a dark cloud.
Alright, boys...here she is!
Please...Hank!
One of the local papers
wants an informal picture.
OK...at ease...
Fine!
One from this angle...
Excuse me!
Do you like this sort of thing?
Part of my business.
Does your press-agent follow you
everywhere you go?
You've got about as much privacy
as the quintuplets.
Why don't you give up
this "Punch & Judy" existence.
What would you suggest?
I'd get rid of all this...
They'll be in your bedroom, next.
And those sycophants...
Get rid of them, too!
That'll be the beginning
of your freedom.
- I'm free.
-Are you?
-Yes
Look...the storm is gathering.
Let's get out of here.
Now you're talking!
Thank you, my antelope friend.
My card, Sir...
Pistols at dawn...20 paces!
Ain't much to gaze upon...
but 'tis mine own!
It's rather quaint!
It's an old wisecrack...
And now, O mighty "Queen"...
if 'tis not beneath thee...
When are you going to stop
calling me "Queen"?
When you stop being one.
Just a moment!
Just one moment!
The hand is quicker than the handle.
What have you done about
getting the divorce?
Not a thing, until I find out
who the other man is.
What other man?
The one you came back
to New York for.
Oh, yes...
The one you married ME for.
Don't be silly.
There is no other man.
You better bring him
over for my approval.
You don't believe me, do you?
No.
I suppose I'll have to hire a man
for the purpose.
What, again?
Smell that?
Know what it is?
It's honeysuckle...
get acquainted with it.
It'll soothe a seething soul.
Sounds like advertising copy.
It is.
I'm advertising agent.
The stars are disappearing...
it might rain.
Do you mind?
No...but I think we ought to go back.
I want to show you one of the things
that makes life worthwhile.
You know this car becomes you
rather well, don't you?
Where are you going?
What's that on my foot?!
It's nothing...it's only a twig.
My goodness...I was scared to death.
Oh...what's that?
Anything can happen to you...
Come on.
This place is full of things.
It's heavenly!
Go on...sit down a minute.
Shut your eyes, and listen.
Do you hear it?
What?
The music!
Nobody's been able
to capture it yet.
That's the only true music
in the world.
The singing of the birds...
The cry of a wolf...
The rustle of the wind through the leaves...
You're selling me nature,
aren't you?
Nature needs a salesman...yeah.
- Tell me something.
- What?
All this jumping about from place to place...
Why do you do it?
Why don't you settle down?
That'd be dull.
How did you happen
to be in Mexico?
Well, I saw a picture in a magazine
of a sunset down there.
I got hungry for the real thing
so I hopped down and painted it.
I'd like to see it sometime.
A priest in Empanada got stuck on it,
so I gave it to him.
Are you a good artist?
Sometimes, when I do something
for myself.
Why don't you try it?
Try what?
Sing for the sheer joy of singing.
Sing, just to please yourself.
You've worked very hard,
haven't you?
For what?
To sing professionally?
To sing for a pay-check?
For the approbation
of a diamond-studded audience.
Where's the fun?
Listen...
You want to get a real "bang"?
Sing something now!
Now?
Sure...sing for the greatest audience
in the world!
Sing because something sings
inside of you.
Will you?
<i>Tell me please, who writes the melodies...</i>
<i>That ripple through the trees...</i>
<i>In early spring.</i>
<i>And the ones who write the lovely words</i>
<i>That are the happy birds, in order to sing...</i>
<i>Roam above, with care and love...</i>
<i>That wondrous beauty floats down..</i>
<i>When we met, our theme was set...</i>
<i>We brought to light the notes...</i>
<i>Our song breaks out of glory...</i>
<i>Then in spring...</i>
<i>Our song still burning after...</i>
<i>A child to see...</i>
<i>Something fine of our design...</i>
<i>That's yours and mine forever.</i>
<i>Our song...gaily we'll fondle it...</i>
Thanks.
That was swell.
Ever have an audience
like that in your life?
What's that?!
There you are...
Even the heavens are applauding!
Oh, my goodness!
Come on!
-My hat!
-That won't do you any good...Stick this one on.
Where can we go?
I know a place...
right down the road.
Oh...it's wet!
Here we are!
Thank goodness!
I'm drenched!
How about a good hot bath
right now!
Don't mention it!
OK...Come on!
Hey...come on...open up!
Maybe they won't take us in!
Open up...
with the speed of 2 antelopes.
Jimmy...Oh, Jimmy...you're home!
Jimmy!...We've missed you so!
Alright...come on in...
He's come home!
Jimmy Hudson's come home!
You know we were talking about you
last night!
And I said to Pa...
I know he'll be home soon.
Hello, Jimmy!
Hi ya Babe! I'm all wet!
This is a surprise, Jimmy!
It's been over a year.
- You look fine!
- You're  looking alright yourself, Toots.
How's the old lumbago?
I don't think you had anything,
anyway.
Say...the old place looks alright,
doesn't it?
Well, we've done our best
to take care of it.
Come on...jump!
Holy smoke!...
I'm sorry, dear...
This Mr and Mrs Hamilton...
Otherwise known as
"Babe" and "Toots".
They're my two kids...
I had a tough time
bringing them up, too.
How do you do!
OH!...This is...
my...
My wife!
Your wife?
Oh, my dear!...
My dear!
Jimmy Hudson's wife!...
Let me look at you.
Oh, my dear...
I hope you'll be very happy,
Mrs Hudson.
Her name's Louise!
Louise...that was my mother's name.
Ma, she'll catch her death...
Better take her up
and run a warm bath.
My goodness, yes.
Come along, dear!
You get your bag,
so she can change.
Didn't bring anything...
left it at the hotel...
Fix her up with something,
will you, Toots.
Yes, of course.  Come along dear...
You must be frozen to the bone.
Say...have you had your supper?
No!  And we're starved!
Ma!...Is any lamb left?
Yes...put it on the stove,
and I'll be down in just a minute.
But first of all...start a fire.
So you were married in Mexico?
I'll bet it must have been romantic!
Here...this is Pa's...
it'd just about fit you.
- How are the pants?
- Oh, fine!
How long have you known...Jimmy?
Oh, since he was THAT high!
You know Pa and me...
We used to work for Jimmy's folks.
When they passed on...
...May God rest their souls...
Jimmy took us to live with him.
I hope you'll like it here.
Jimmy's always traipsing off somewhere.
Maybe you can put an anchor on him.
Feel better?
Nice and warm!
You look beautiful.
I'm glad it's you.
You're just what I imagined
Jimmy's wife would be like.
He'll make you happpy, Louise...
Jimmy's a good boy.
Except, he needs some common sense
knocked into him.
You know the Hamelsin Galleries wanted to pay him
$10,000 for one of his pictures.
They were crazy about it...
but he wouldn't sell it.
He wouldn't?
Did he say why?
Yes..he said he was crazy about it, too.
And that was that!
Goodness...here I am...
blabbing my head off...
And the lamb's on the stove...
Pa's sure to ruin it.
Come on dear...
You must be starving.
Only got 12 yesterday...
Be better next week, though.
Like to fish, Louise?
I haven't done much of it.
Well, I'll take you out
in a day or so...
I know a little cold weather
will snap 'em good!
Sorry, Babe, I'm afraid Louise can't stay...
she has some business in New York...
Very important...isn't it dear?
Yes, very important.
I'm sorry, Mr Hamilton.
Hello?
Wait a minute.
Now, hello...
Who?
Fuller?
No...you must have
the wrong number.
Wait a minute, Babe...hold it...
That's for Louise.
Sorry!...Yes...She's here.
Hang on!
Forgot about your maiden name.
Hello, darling...I was worried about you..
are you alright?
Oh, yes...I'm fine.
How did you find out
I was here?
Simple process of looking
in the telephone book.
I'll get in the car
and come for you.
Oh, no...I'm fine.
What do you want to do?
Stay there tonight?
Yes...yes, of course.
Oh yes, I'm fine, thank you.
Well dear, I'm glad you're fine...
Good luck!
Goodbye.
How are you feeling?
Miserable.
Who was that...your press agent?
That guy even found you here.
- How's the lamb?
- Delicious!
After supper pie, you'd better move
the double bed into Jimmy's room.
They'll be needing it, now.
Yes, I guess so.
<i>In the gloaming, O my darling...</i>
<i>When the lights are dim and low...</i>
<i>And the quiet shadows falling...</i>
<i>Softly come, and softly go.</i>
Rain's just about stopped.
<i>Will you think of me and love me</i>
<i>As you did once long ago?</i>
Who is that at this hour
of the night?
Wait...I'll go and see.
We heard that Jim's here!
Hey, Solly...where's the old Doghouse...
come on...bring him in!
- How are the kids?
- Swell!
Boys, I want you to meet my wife!
Well...went and got yourself hitched, eh?
- I'll be doggone!
- Gee-whiz!
This is Otto and Harvey and Ward
and Jimmy and Shorty...
They're the 5 musical souls
of these here parts.
With me at the piano, we used to make up
a sextet that was nothing short of startling.
Used to sing too...
Believe it or not.
Well, we thought we'd drop in...
and spill a few!
No, not for me now, Otto...
From now on my wife
does all the singing in the family.
Well, maybe she'll join us?
We could use a good soprano.
Well, that all depends...
How's her voice?
Fair to middling, I'd say.
I'd like to hear it.
Maybe she should sing something...
See if she'll fit in with us.
Yeah, well that's being practical, Otto...
What would you like?
How about "Minnie the Moocher"?
Yes "Minnie the Moocher"!
Boys, I'm afraid
she wouldn't know that...
What makes you think so?
What makes you think
I wouldn't know it?
Wait a minute, darling,
they said "Minnie the Moocher"...
I heard 'em.
Honey, that's not by Puccini or Verdi...
I know..."Minnie the Moocher"..
by Cab Calloway, Irving Mills, and Clarence Gaskill, right?
Wait a minute boys...
there's something wrong about this.
You mean you really
want to sing it?
Well, alright...boys...get organised!
Everybody ready?
Harvey!...Hats off and hair flying...
let her have it!
<i>Oh...here's a story about Minnie the Moocher...</i>
<i>She was a lowdown hoochie coocher...</i>
<i>She was the roughest, and the toughest frail...</i>
<i>But Minnie had a heart as big as a whale.</i>
<i>Oh...poor Min!</i>
<i>Oh...poor Min!</i>
<i>She had a dream about the King of Rumania</i>
<i>He gave her gold and lots of champagnia!</i>
<i>He had a million dollars in nickels and dimes</i>
<i>And every day she counted them a million times.</i>
<i>Oh...poor Min!</i>
<i>Oh...poor Min!</i>
<i>Minnie used to sing that thing
Long before they called it "swing"...</i>
<i>She could drive a man to ruin
With a "Hey! Hey! How am I?..."</i>
<i>Minnie never cared about temptation...</i>
<i>All she cared about was syncopation...</i>
<i>She made it famous through the nation...</i>
<i>But she couldn't leave her man!</i>
<i>They put her where they put the crazies...</i>
<i>Now poor old Min is kickin' up the daisies.</i>
<i>You heard my story..
this ends the song...</i>
<i>She was a good girl...</i>
<i>But they done her...</i>
<i>...wrong!</i>
How about it, Otto...is she in?
Good night, Mrs Hudson.
Good night!
C'mon, Ma...it's after 10 o'clock.
Goodness! Is it that late?
Yes, yes!...Come on!
Jimmy!...
Don't keep Louise up too late.
It's bed time...
and she must be tired out.
OK, Toots...good night.
Good night, Jimmy.
Good night, Louise.
Good night.
It's lovely, the fire, isn't it?
Yes. It was nice of you
to sing for them.
I enjoyed it!
Not bad, either...
Bowled me over!
Thank you.
You bowled me over too...
I saw some of your work upstairs.
Why didn't you tell me
this was your house?
I was afraid you wouldn't have come.
Well, maybe not.
I had to get you away...
even for a little while...
Just to see how he other half lives.
I like the way
the other half lives.
If I ask you a question
about something...
Will you tell me the truth?
I don't know...what?
Why did you marry me?
I had a reason...it was important
I get back to New York.
Why did you do it?
A lot of money in it.
I said..."the truth"!
You spent all the money I gave you
for a wedding present.
What's the real reason?
Won't you tell me?
Yes...I'll tell you...
When I was a boy...the first picture
I ever did was a picture of a girl.
Pretty hopeless job...she was
a little out of proportion and funny-looking.
But to  me...to me
she had all the virtues.
Honesty and simplicity
and no pretence.
Great pal!
That night in Mexico,
the night you sang...
For a minute I thought
I'd caught a glimpse of her.
And since then?
Since then, she's been buried
under a mass of tinsel.
You brought her here to try
to dig her out, didn't you?
Yeah.
Don't you think you've succeeded, Jimmy?
Yeah...for a while...
The only thing that worries me,
is that...
Ever been to the White Mountains?
I know a spot up there you'd love.
It's miles from civilisation.
I stumbled on it one day when I was wandering
through the country.
I stayed up there 2 months...
all by myself.
Never saw another human being.
It was wonderful.
Some of the pine trees up there are so tall,
you can't even see the tops.
At night, I'd lie...
Staring up at them...
Trying to figure out
what they were reaching for.
Did you ever figure it out?
Finally decided they weren't reaching
for a thing...
Just stretching their lazy old bones...
at peace with the world.
Hey! That's Babe's best pipe!
What are you doing up,
at this time of night...go to bed!
I'll bet you she heard everything
we said.
Oh well, she won't say a word.
Someday, I'm going to take you up there.
To the White Mountains?
You'll go mad about the place.
I'm sure I would.
Say...how about now?
Now?
Sure...what do you say
we leave this minute?
I'd love it!
Would you really?
Alright!  We'll just disappear...
and tell the world to go hang, eh?
Marvellous!
I'll go down the store
and get some provisions.
Listen...get into your clothes...
If we leave right away we can get there
just as dawn breaks...
Wait til you see it...
It's a sight that'll take your breath away!
That's for nothing.
Jimmy!
What?
That's for everything!
I'll be back with the speed
of 4 antelopes.
Come on...
We're going to the mountains!
OK, Jimmy...
Everything you said.
Thanks.
Mail this for me, will you Charlie.
Just drop it in there.
Yeah, I know...but YOU do it for me.
Wait a minute...
Let me know when it goes down.
Good to depend on you, Charlie...
Where's the rest of the stuff?
Out in the car...
enough to last you for months.
- Hi, Ted!
- Hello there , Jimmy!
Mr and Mrs Hudson's residence.
Yes...this is...
Oh, Hank! What are you doing here?
And how did you find out
I was married?
One of the boys got a wire
from Mexico.
We're down here at the village store,
and we're coming right up.
Well, you needn't waste your time,
because I'm going away.
What do you mean,
you're "going away"?
Say...listen!
This is great publicity for the Festival...
you can't go away!
The Festival!
Yes, the Festival!
Don't tell me you forgot about it!
Uncle Walter's been working his head off
and he's got everything in shape.
<i>This is a great break for the show!</i>
Well, here we are...all set.
Got enough provisions to last for months...
out in the car.
If we run short...
we've got a couple off fishing rods and a gun.
Wait til I get some clothes and blankets...
Honey...we're on out way.
Jimmy...
Jimmy...I can't go.
Why...what's the matter?
I forgot all about the song festival.
What song festival?
I have to sing at a festival next month,
and I forgot all about it.
Don't be silly...
call it off!
I can't!
You've sung at festivals before..
one more or less...
I have to sing at this one.
Why?
It's a debt I owe..
I've got to pay...
It's terribly important...
more important than anything.
Oh, is it?
It's for someone
who's very close to me, darling.
And that's why you can't go, eh?
But...but we can go later.
I'll unload the stuff.
Jimmy!
If I didn't feel the obligation
so strongly...
Yes, I know...I forgot all about
your obligations!
I  guess I'd be up against them
all the time.
Your obligations to your friends, to your public
and to your sycophants!
I'm sorry for you!
You'll never dig yourself out!
I must have been crazy
to think you could.
Please, darling...
Your only chance is to look at an obligation
in the face and tell it to go to blazes...
But you never will...it's a cinch!
You've got yourself hooked in
by that bunch of phonies around you...
And you can't get out.
I'm beginning to think you like it.
Hi...is Fuller here?
Sure...You're right on time...
Come on in...She's yours!
Yes, boys, come right in.
Where do you want me to pose?
Come on in, boys!
There's no privacy around here...
You'll find the bedroom upstairs.
Land sakes!
What's going on down there?
Hey, where is the stoop
she's married to?
Hey, buddy...
Right here...here's the stoop
she married.
Hey, fellas...here's the groom!
I thought he wanted
his picture taken.
Jimmy!
Thanks for the story, Miss Fuller.
Come on...
Wait a minute...
Here's a good shot, here.
Hello.
Hello, Uncle Walter.
Darling..what a surprise!
What a lovely surprise!
I didn't see the papers
until I got down to rehearsal...
Why didn't you tell me?
I'm so happy!
Oh, no...I can't wait...
I'm coming right back...
I want to meet him!
No...Don't you come here...
you stay down there and go on rehearsing.
And I'll come down there.
No...he isn't here...
He's out of town...yes, out of town.
Yes, he's nice.
I'll tell you all about it.
Yes, dear...
Goodbye.
My dear...you shouldn't have done it!
The moon has just moved into Aries!
You shouldn't have done it,
my dear.
What's he like?
And what if he doesn't like ME?
Oh, my dear...I didn't sleep a wink...
Not a wink...
I kept tossing and tossing...
I had a premonition
something was going to happen.
Why didn't you tell us?
I kill myself!
Get out!  Get out!
But darling...you talk to me like this?
Get out...all of you!
I know why you're doing this!
Because the moon has moved into Aries!
I'm doing it because I can't stand
your stupid faces any longer!
"Parting is such sweet sorrow".
Get out!  Get out!
I never want to see you again!
I think I'll get married.
And I shall go back
to numerology again.
Why didn't you, Miss?
Have the car here
at 7 o'clock sharp please...
Miss Fuller wants to go down
as early as possible.
Mrs Young, take several girls,
go over each costume carefully...
and see that they're all neatly hung up
in the dressing rooms.
Yes, Ma'am.
All the critics got their tickets?
Yes...sure.
That's good!
Hey!...look...listen...
I haven't had a decent story
in weeks.
Where's the guy...the thing...
the husband?
The boys want to know...
They're getting suspicious!
That's why they're newspapermen.
Where is he?
Nobody knows.
He's a myth.
A what?
A myth!  A myth!
Big man like you
to talk baby-talk!
Well, I'm busier than a flock of ants
at a picnic...
I've never had more fun.
How do you feel?
Alright.
Don't you think it's about time
you forgot him?
This can't go on indefinitely.
Yes...you're right.
I shouldn't waste another minute
thinking about him.
He was so mean and crazy and stubborn
and unreasonable!
Yes, I know, but you love him.
I'm thoroughly familiar
with all the pains.
My first husband put ME
through the whole works.
Louise!
Come in, Uncle Walter.
I'm going down to check up on everything.
We can't have anything go wrong you know.
How do you feel dear?
Remember what I told you...
you must keep calm.
Now you stay indoors...
and rest all the afternoon.
Well, it's here...
tonight's the night.
I thought I'd be nervous and excited...
but I'm not.
Where's your necktie?
Oh, I don't think I'd wear bedroom slippers...
That's not being done!
That comes of dressing in a hurry.
See you later, dear.
How about your husband?
Is he coming tonight?
No...
Goodness!...is he still out of town?
Uncle Walter, you've got a lot of work.
I'd better go...Now remember, dear...
Get your rest!
Now don't tell me
he hasn't been told yet!
No, I didn't want to upset him.
How long do you think
you can keep this up?
The newspapers are getting suspicious.
You'll wind up
by being made ridiculous, too!
I wish it were over with...
I wish I'd never met him.
I'll be happy when we're divorced.
Divorced?!
Can I use that?
Yes...you may say that I'm anxious
to be free.
You may say that this marriage
has been a great mistake.
And I'll be very happy when this stupid affair
is done with and forgotten.
- You mean that?
- Yes!
Holy smokes!
Did that make you
feel any better?
No.
I didn't think so.
Always jumping around, somewhere.
First to Mexico...
and now to the White Mountains...
Why don't you light somewhere?
What were you doing
down in Mexico, anyway?
What are you going to the White Mountains for?
You ought to stay right here in New York
and go to the Festival with us.
Here's your tie.
You finally found a nice girl,
and then you let her slip away from you.
Why don't you stop jabbering
like that?
I know she's a nice girl...
but she's running a 3-ring circus.
Do you think I want to become
part of that?
You don't have to shout so...
You'll wake up Pa.
Well, you're not helping any.
I told you...It's all over.
Here...here's the divorce!
Now you know why I went to Mexico...
if that'll make you happy.
Divorce!
Yeah...I'm mailing it tonight.
Well you haven't the brains
you were born with.
Maybe I haven't.
I know you haven't.
Alright...alright!
Oh, Jimmy...
You're in love with that girl...
Don't be a fool.
You'll be sorry.
You've been skedaddling around for years.
And when you find a real girl,
you let her slip away from you.
You'd better take of yourself tonight, Toots...
there's going to be an awful mob there.
What train are you taking?
The first one I can get on.
Goodbye, Toots.
So long Babe.
Say so long to Babe for me...and listen...
Don't stay in this town
any longer than you have to!
It'd give you the jibbers.
A lower to Boston.
Would you be interested
in an excursion to Yosemite?
A lower to Boston!
Yes, Sir...one lower to Boston.
Have you got any stamps here?
You'll find stamps
at the cigar counter.
How about Death Valley?
My sister was there last summer
and she reported Death Valley delightful.
YOUR sister would.
She says she'll be happy
when she gets her divorce.
She'll be what?
Happy, when she gets her divorce!
Says her marriage was stupid.
What?
Stupid!
Don't talk to me like that!
SHE says her marriage was stupid.
Just like ours.
- What?
- Nothing, sweetheart.
Why don't he give her the divorce,
if it'll make her happy?
Probably holding out for money.
Yessir, that's just about...
I beg your pardon!
Young man!
Friend of yours?...
Very nice!
<i>Softly goes my song's entreaty.</i>
<i>through the night to thee...</i>
<i>In the silent woods I wait thee,
Come, my love, to me</i>
<i>O, come, my love, to me</i>
<i>Treetops slender sigh and whisper,
in the moon light here... </i>
<i>In the moonlight here.</i>
<i>No unfriendly ear shall listen,
Darling, have no fear... </i>
<i>Darling have no fear.</i>
Has anyone come in?
I'll be right here at th door.
Oh, my darling...
you were magnificent!
No I'm sorry!
We're very good friends of hers.
You can't see her
'til after the show.
Oh, it's you!
Beginning to get to you,
isn't it, Hank?
He's here...I just saw him come in...
He's here!
Who?
Jimmy?!
Is he coming here to see me?
I think so...I just saw him
coming down the hall.
I knew it!
I knew he'd come!
Marie..get me my robe...
With the speed of an antelope!
Nobody can go in!
And that goes for you too.
What I mean is... she doesn't
want to see anybody.
Oh, hello, Rembrandt...go right in.
Thought you weren't supposed
to let anybody in!
Nobody can go in!
Hello, Jimmy.
So nice of you to drop in!
You're looking well!
I haven't seen you
for such a long time.
How have you been?
I was on my way up
to the White Mountains...
..and found I had some unfinished business.
You may not know it, but I like to go around
making people happy...
I thought you ought to get YOUR share.
In order to be happy,
you apparently need 2 things...
The Festival and the divorce.
Well, you've got your Festival...
Here's a little present for you.
I'm glad you thought
our marriage was stupid.
That's the first thing
we've had in common.
Incidentally...according to a deal we made once...
that document's worth $5,000.
You can send your cheque to an institution
for the feeble-minded.
I'm going there
to get my head examined.
What happened?
I just saw him leave.
It's the divorce, eh?
Uncle Walter!
It went splendidly,
didn't it, Marianne?
Louise...You were magnificent...
Darling...magnificent!
They loved you!
I could feel them thrill!
I could feel them vibrate!
Now comes my song...
The moment I've been waiting for.
Thank you, darling.
- It'll go over with a bang!
- You bet we will.
Uncle Walter's prancing around like a kid...
It's worth the price of admission just to see him.
Certainly the biggest night of HIS life.
Oh, I can't do it...I simply
won't be able to do it!
Stop it! Louise!
Think of Walter!  It's his own song, too...
You can't quit now.
But how can I sing...
when my throat's all choked up?
Yes, I know...
It's the song I sang for Jimmy...
My dear...you can't get in!
Hank...go out and tell them
to hold up the proms for a while.
She doesn't feel well...Hurry!
Come on girls, you're late!
- Hey, Nosey...come here!
- Yes Sir!
Go out and tell them to hold the performance
for a while... Miss Fuller's sick.
Yes, Sir!
Never mind, girls...my mistake.
What are you doing here?
Carrying a torch, Mister.
Isn't that too bad!
Bring up the house lights, Andy...
we're holding the show.
- Holding the show?
- Yeah
Mr Mitchell...
They want you to wait...
something's happened to Miss Fuller.
 Something's happened? What?
I don't know, but they want you
to hold the performance.
- Goodness! I must go to her.
- No...Stay here...she'll be alright.
- What did he say?
- Something's happened to Miss Fuller.
- What happened?
- I don't know.
- Sick I guess.
- Who's that?
Miss Fuller...they say she can't go on.
She can't go on!
- Can't go on?
- What's the idea?
It's awful...she had an accident.
What kind of an accident?
...Backstage...tables laying all over the place
She probably tripped on it.
-Who's that...-Miss Fuller...-What happened?
Miss Fuller tripped over a table
and got hurt.
Remember, Mamma , that's how Auntie
sprained her ankle.
Strained her ankle? You don't say!
- How did that happen?
- Piece of scenery fell on her.
Broken?...I heard it was sprained.
Piece of scenery fell on it,
it's broken alright.
If she has a broken leg,
the show must be over.
- It might go ahead without her.
- Yeah...let's wait.
I had a broken leg, once.
The pain was awful!
I wonder if they sent for an ambulance.
Surely they must have.
Poor girl, she may never be able
to sing again.
Yeah, with a shock like that,
you never can tell.
Hey...what happened?
What are they talking about?
The ceiling backstage collapsed.
A steel girder fell on Miss Fuller
and broke her leg.
They just sent for the ambulance.
And I'm going home.
Go back and start the number...
I'll get her on that stage...
Don't you worry!
If she can't sing, Marianne,
don't try to make her.
It's perfectly alright.
Uncle Walter...Go on! Go on!
Get ready, we're going ahead...
Watch for you signal.
Come on Andy...
Come on girls...snap into it!
Light the torches, Tony.
Please, Madam...
you ought to go out there.
Come on, they're ready to start.
Did you see this?
I couldn't have said these things.
- I'm afraid you did...Come on!
- I must have been crazy.
Why didn't you stop me?
I'm going to find Jimmy.
Don't be silly!...
There are 20,000 people out there.
It's a fine time to get temperamental...
after all that old man did for her.
What are you talking about?
Didn't she marry that dope in Mexico,
just to put this show on?
What's the idea of getting temperamental
at the last minute?
What are you shooting off steam about?
She broke her leg,
that's why she can't go on.
Jimmy!
Broke her leg, eh?...
Wise guy!
Oh, Jimmy...I didn't mean the things I said...
honest I didn't.
I didn't think our marriage was stupid..
I thought it was beautiful.
- Hey..where are you going?
- Louise, it's started.
Jimmy, I got rid of the sycophants!
Hey, wait a minute...
What's going to happen to the show!
Go away!  You're fired!
Jimmy, I want to go to the mountains with you...
Let's go now, darling...
- You can't go anyplace now!
- You've got to sing!
I don't want to sing...
I want to go to the White Mountains.
If you go away now, you're a rat!
No, you're not a rat, dear...
You're a dear.
She's doing this for the dearest friend
she has in the world.
She'll break that old guy's heart!
Oh, I'll put on a million festivals for him...
One every night!
What's she's doing she'll feel sorry for this,
 the rest of her life.
Jimmy, you know that girl
you were talking about...
Well she's dug herself out
from the tinsel for good!
That's the song you're going to sing,
isn't it?
- No.
- Yes it is!
They're ready for her to start.
- Go on out there and sing it!
- I don't want to!
You're not going to stamp that
on my conscience...Come on!
You'll only be for your audience
won't you?
Only for you, Jimmy...
Only for you, darling.
Do you don't.
Go on out there and sing.
And listen, you...
I want to hear that song sung
the way it should be sung...
It better be good.
I'll try, Jimmy...
But promise me you won't go away.
If I can stand it...Go ahead!
Oh, but I don't go on here...
I go round to the back!
Hold him here, somebody!
- Hold him, Hank.
- Oh, yeah.
