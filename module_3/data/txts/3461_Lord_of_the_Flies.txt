Hi! Ouch!
Hey, wait for me.
I can't hardly move
with all these creeper things.
Them other kids must have
got scattered in the dark.
We ought to go and find them.
My auntie told me not to run
on account of my asthma.
- Asthma ?
- That's right.
I was the only boy
in our school that had asthma.
And I've been wearing specs
since I was three.
- Where's the plane ?
- The storm must have dragged it out.
There must have been
some kids still in it.
Are there any grown-ups ?
- I don't think so.
- What's your name ?
Ralph.
I don't care what they call me,
as long as they don't call me
what they did at school.
What's that ?
- They used to call me ''Piggy.''
- Piggy!
As long as you don't
tell the others.
Daddy's a commander in the Navy.
One day when he gets leave,
he'll come and rescue us.
- Aren't you coming in ?
- Ooh, it's hot.
No. My auntie wouldn't let me--
account of my asthma.
Sucks to your asthma.
You can't half swim well.
- Hey, look!
- It's a shell.
I've seen one like it before
on someone's back wall.
A conch, he called it. He used
to blow it, and his mum would come.
He blew from down here.
- You've done it!
Hey! Is anyone there ?
Hey! Hey!
- I think we ought explore a bit.
- What's your name ?
- Percival Williams Madison...
the Vicarage, Hartcourt,
St. Anthony, telephone: Hartcourt 241 .
- And what's your name ?
- George.
- What's your name ?
- Sam and Eric.
Sam and Eric.
Sam and Eric.
Choir, halt!
Where's the man
with the trumpet ?
There's no man
with a trumpet. Only me.
- Isn't there a man here ?
- No.
Then we'll have
to look after ourselves.
We're having a meeting.
Come and join us.
- Is he all right ?
Put him in the shade, quick!
- Let him alone.
- But, Merridew.
He'll be all right.
Simon's always throwing a faint.
Now let's decide
what we're going to do.
That's why Ralph made a meeting--
so as we can decide what to do.
We got most names.
Those two-- they're twins.
Sam and Eric.
- I'm Sam.
- I'm Eric.
I'm Ralph.
- And you ?
- Douglas.
- Yours ?
- Charles.
And what are all your names ?
Henry.
Maurice.
Robert.
Wilbur.
Harold.
Bill.
Roger.
- Simon.
- I'm Jack.
- And that boy there. He--
- You're talking too much.
- Shut up, Fatty!
- His name's not Fatty.
- His real name's Piggy.
- Piggy!
We've got to decide
about being rescued.
I think we ought to have
a chief to decide things.
- Someone must take charge.
- I ought to be chief.
- Him with the shell!
- He got us together.
- I'm chief chorister and head boy.
- Let's have a vote.
All right. We'll have a vote.
- Who wants Jack for chief then ?
- Who wants me ?
- Me!
- Me!
- Me!
Me. Me.
I'm chief, then.
Jack's in charge of the choir.
What do you want them to be ?
Hunters.
Choir, take off your togs.
Hey, what are you wearing
those funny clothes for ?
It's our uniform.
Listen, everybody.
If this isn't an island,
we might get rescued
straightaway.
So we've got to decide
if it is.
Three of us will go
on an expedition to find out.
I'll go and Jack.
- And--
- Take me. Please.
You. You all right now ?
- I'll come.
- We don't want you. Three's enough.
I was with him
when he found the conch.
I was with him
before anyone else was.
- You can't come.
- You told them after what I said--
after I said I didn't want--
What are you talking about ?
About being called Piggy.
I said I didn't care
as long as they didn't call me Piggy.
And I said not to tell.
And then you went
and said straight out--
- Better Piggy than Fatty.
And anyway, I'm sorry
if you feel like that.
Go back, Piggy, and take names.
That's your job. So long.
Hey, look!
One, two, three.
Heave!
Heave!
We're on an uninhabited island.
We shall have
to look after ourselves.
But it's a good island.
There's lots of fruit, water,
and I'm pretty sure there aren't
any dangerous animals.
So things aren't so bad.
None of us are hurt.
There isn't any danger,
and we can build shelters
and be comfortable.
So if we're sensible--
if we do things properly--
if we don't lose our head--
we'll be all right.
- But where will we sleep ?
- We'll build shelters.
We can have smashing fun.
And another thing.
We can't have everybody talking at once.
We shall have to put our hands up,
then I'll give him the conch.
[Jack ]
I agree with Ralph.
We've got to have rules
and obey them.
After all, we're not savages.
We're English.
-And the English are best at everything.
So we'll have lots of rules,
and when anybody breaks them--
- Piggy, Piggy, Piggy!
- Quiet!
You're not letting Ralph
get to the most important thing.
Who knows we're here ?
Nobody knows we're here.
Perhaps they knew
where we were going to,
perhaps not.
But they don't know where we are now
'cause we never got there.
We might stay here
till we die.
He wants to know what you're going to do
about the snake thing.
Tell us about
the snake thing.
Now he says
it was a beastie.
Beastie?
-A snake thing, ever so big. He saw it.
- When ?
When he was hiding
in the jungle in the dark.
He says when the rain stopped,
it turned into one of them things
like ropes in the trees...
and hung in the branches.
He says,
''Will it come back tonight ?''
But there isn't a beastie.
I tell you,
there isn't a beast.
Ralph's right, of course.
There isn't a snake thing, but
if there was, we'd hunt and kill it.
There's another thing.
If a ship comes near,
they may not notice us.
So we must make smoke on top
of the mountain. We must make a fire.
Come on. Follow me.
- Yes!
- Let's go now!
Just like kids--
like a crowd of kids.
I bet it's gone teatime.
Anybody got any matches ?
My, what a big heap
you've made!
Piggy's specs!
Come on!
Get out of the light!
Roger, hey, Roger.
Come on over here.
My specs!
Ralph, I'll split up my choir--
my hunters, that is.
And we'll be responsible
for keeping the fire going.
We'll make a big blaze now.
It'll last all night.
Come and give us a hand.
Attention!
Here comes one.
This is a nice one.
Just a minute.
Be careful.
Go!
No!
It isn't gonna hit you!
Ooh!
Come on, come on!
Kill! Kill!
No throwing sand!
Ralph, come here! It's a plane!
A plane! A plane!
Can't you hear it ? Ralph, it's going!
Hurry up! Ralph!
I can't see no smoke.
Where is it ?
Smoke.
Piggy's glasses!
If the fire's out, we'll need them!
Stop! Come back!
Come back!
Come back! Come back!
They've let
the bloody fire out!
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!
Hey, Ralph!
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in! Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in! Kill the pig!
Slit her throat!
Bash her in! Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!
Kill the pig!
Look. We killed a pig!
We stole up on it!
You let the fire out.
We can light it up again.
You should have been
with us, Ralph.
There was lots of blood!
You should have seen it.
There was a plane.
There was a plane!
They might have seen us.
We might have gone home!
You and your blood, Jack Merridew!
You and your hunting!
We might have gone home!
We needed meat.
You didn't
ought to have let the fire go out!
- My specs!
Here. Here they are.
Just you wait!
That was a dirty trick.
All right, all right.
I'm sorry!
About the fire, I mean.
There. I apologize.
Light the fire, then.
Choir!
Piggy.
No, Ralph, don't! Please!
I'll bring them back.
Will it swell up his legs ?
- Give me a leg.
- Give it to me.
- Give me a piece, please.
Aren't I havin' none ?
You didn't hunt.
No more did Ralph.
No more did Simon.
Eat, damn you!
- Kill the pig!
- Oink, oink, oink.
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat!
Quiet!
Get down on the beach.
We're calling an assembly.
Things are beginning to break up.
I don't know why.
It all began well.
Then people started forgetting
what really matters.
The most important thing for all
of us is getting rescued.
So now let's discuss who does what,
and when we have decided,
we can start again...
and be careful about things
like the fire.
All right, so the fire went out.
But we're hunters.
We got you meat.
And if there is a beast,
it's my hunters who
will protect you from it.
What's your name?
What's your name? What's your name?
What's your name ?
Quiet! Quiet!
What's your name ?
Percival Williams Madison,
the Vicarage,
Hartcourt, St. Anthony.
Telephone--
Telephone--
- Tele--
What did he say ?
He says there's a beast.
It comes out of the sea.
My daddy said they haven't found
all the animals in the sea.
My daddy says
there are animals--
What do you call them ?
They make ink
and are hundreds of feet long...
and eat whales whole.
A squid can't come out of the water.
Maybe he means
it's some sort of ghost.
Maybe that's
what the beast is, a ghost.
I don't believe
in no ghosts. Ever.
- Who cares what you believe, Fatty ?
Maybe there is a beast.
Hear him. He's got the conch.
What I mean is,
maybe it's only us.
Nuts!
We should have left all this
till daylight.
We're tired.
We'll have a vote--
on ghosts, I mean--
and then go back
to the shelters.
Who thinks there
may be ghosts ?
- I see.
- I didn't vote for no ghosts.
Remember that, all of you.
You shut up, you fat slug!
I got the conch!
Oh, Jack, let him speak.
He's got the conch.
And you shut up. Who are you,
telling people what to do ?
- You can't hunt. You can't sing.
- I'm chief. I was chosen.
Why should choosing make any difference,
telling people what to do ?
- Piggy's got the conch.
- Favor Piggy as you always do.
-Jack!
-Jack! Jack!
- You're breaking the rules!
- Who cares ?
Because the rules are
the only thing we've got.
Bullocks to the rules!
We're strong. We hunt.
If there's a beast,
we'll hunt it down!
What's grown-ups going
to say ? Look at 'em!
I think I ought to
give up being chief.
You can't, Ralph. Not now.
Blow the conch.
You've got to be tough.
Make them do what you want.
If I blow the conch,
and they don't come back,
then we've had it.
Are there ghosts, Piggy ?
Or beasts ?
Of course there aren't.
- Why not ?
- Because things wouldn't make sense.
Houses and streets...
and TV.
They wouldn't work.
But suppose they wouldn't make
sense, not here on this island.
Supposing things
are watching us...
and waiting.
Go on being chief, Ralph.
Who's there ?
Me, Simon.
I wish my auntie were here.
Oh, what's the use ?
Grown-ups know things.
They ain't afraid
of the dark.
They'd meet and have tea
and discuss.
Then things would be
all right.
Sam.
What's the matter?
Shh.
- It was furry.
- There was something moving...
behind his head-- wings.
It sort of sat up.
It had eyes, teeth, claws.
We ran as fast as we could,
bashed into things.
The beast followed us.
Then he caught me.
You're not pulling our legs,
are you ?
- We'll hunt it. Who'll come ?
- Me! Me!
But those sticks, they're made of wood.
Don't be so silly.
Frightened ?
Of course I am.
Who wouldn't be ?
Come on. Let's go.
Who'll mind the little ones ?
- Piggy will.
- Right. Keep Piggy out of danger.
Haven't you got any sense ?
How can Piggy help
with only one eye ?
Jack, is there anywhere on this
island where we haven't been ?
There's only--
Of course!
The tail end part,
where the rocks pile up.
I'm chief.
I'll go in alone.
The rest of you
wait here and hide.
Do you think--
I've been all over.
It must be here.
I... don't believe
in the beast.
I suppose not.
Couldn't let you do it
on your own.
What a place for a fort!
The beast isn't here.
-Let's get the others and go to the top.
-Boys!
Now, this story is about
the place where I live,
called Camberley.
Now, Camberley is
quite an old place,
but it hasn't been called
Camberley all the time.
It used to be called
Cambridgetown.
And they used to get mixed up
with the letters...
between Cambridge
or Cambridgetown.
So letters that were to a person
in Cambridgetown...
used to go to a person
in Cambridge.
So they got a bit mixed up.
So they thought they'd change...
the name at the post office,
because it was a post office...
that had all the trouble
of sorting the letters.
And they thought they'd leave
the ''cam'' from Cambridgetown,
and they--
''ber'' is a river,
and there are a lot of rivers
around there.
''Camber.'' And then ''ley,'' because often
the towns near there ended with ''ley.''
Their names ended
with ''ley.''
So they called it
Cam-ber-ley. Camberley.
And that's the true story
of Camberley.
I don't think we should leave
Piggy with the little ones.
Not all night.
We mustn't let anything
happen to Piggy, must we ?
I think someone should go back and tell
them we won't be back till after dark.
I'll go.
I don't mind.
Honestly.
We'll go to the beach.
We can go to the top tomorrow.
If you're frightened, of course.
All right, then.
Who wants to go now ?
You see ?
I'm going to climb the mountain
to look for the beast now.
- Coming ?
- I don't mind.
If you don't mind, of course.
Not at all!
I think it's silly
only two of us go.
If we meet anything
on the other side, two won't be enough.
All right.
Come along, Roger.
If you don't want to go on,
I'll go myself.
Go on, then.
We'll wait here.
Shut up.
I saw a thing on top.
There was a noise too.
Kind of...
Keep close to the ground.
Over there, capping the rock.
First, you know now
we've seen the beast.
We crawled up.
We were only a few feet away.
The beast sat up
and looked at us.
I don't think we could fight a thing
that size. Honestly, you know.
We're talk.
We couldn't fight a tiger.
We'd hide.
Even Jack would hide.
- What about my hunters ?
- Boys armed with sticks ?
All right, then.
He's not a hunter.
He'd never have got us meat.
He's just giving orders,
expects people to obey for nothing.
He's like Piggy.
He says things like Piggy.
He's not a proper chief.
He's a coward.
On top, when Roger and me went on,
he stayed back.
- I went too.
- After.
I went on too, then I went away.
So did you.
Call me a coward then.
All this talk.
- All this talk, talk, talk.
- Right.
I'm not gonna be
part of Ralph's lot.
I'm going off by myself to the rocks
to hunt and have feasts and have fun.
Anyone who wants
can come too.
Jack!
I said we could do
without a certain person.
Now I think
we've got to decide.
We can do without Jack Merridew.
There's others besides him
on this island.
But now we've really
got a beast--
though I can hardly
believe it--
we'll need to stay close
to the platform.
I've been talking, Ralph.
What ?
We've got no fire
on the mountain,
but what's wrong
with a fire down here ?
That's a good idea. We can build it
right here between the shelters.
I think we ought
to climb the mountain.
What's the use ?
What else is there to do ?
And put some dry leaves on.
Make sure they're dry.
If they're wet,
it won't burn properly.
Come on.
Come on.
Now!
Right up the ass.
Sharpen a stick at both ends.
This head is for the beast.
It's a gift.
Can't they see ?
Don't they understand ?
Unless we keep the smoke burning,
we'll die.
What's wrong, Piggy ?
Why are things going
wrong like they are ?
I don't know, Ralph.
Looks like we're going to have
a lot of rain, all right.
What about the fire ?
Hey, come back!
We wouldn't go back to you--
Wee-wah-wo-wee.
Wee-wah-wo-wee.
Wee-wah-wo-wee.
Take 'em some food.
Bananas!
Wee-wah-woo-wo!
Wee-wah-woo-wo!
Wee-wah-woo-wo!
Who'll join my tribe ?
Jack. I'll join your tribe,Jack.
- Who'll join my tribe ?
- I will.
I gave you food, and my hunters
will protect you from the beast.
- Who'll join my tribe ?
- I will,Jack.
I'm chief. And what about the fire ?
I've got the conch!
You haven't got it with you.
You left it behind.
See ? Clever.
Anyway, the conch doesn't count
on this end of the island.
The conch counts here
and all over the island.
Who'll join my tribe ?
- Me, me!
- I will!
- Let's join Jack's tribe!
- Yeah!
Come away.
There's going to be trouble.
Kill the beast!
Kill the beast!
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!
Kill the beast!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!
Kill the beast!
Slit his throat! Bash it in!
Kill the beast!
Slit his throat! Bash it in!

Kill the beast! Slit his throat!
Bash it in!
Kill the beast!
Slit his throat! Bash it in!
Look! The beast!
Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill! Kill!
Piggy, are you
the only one left ?
There are some little ones.
They don't count.
No big ones ?
Oh, Sam and Eric.
They're collecting wood.
- Nobody else ?
- Not that I know of.
Piggy.
- Piggy.
- Huh ?
That was murder.
You stop it! What good are you
doing talking like that ?
It was dark!
There was that bloody dance!
There was thunder
and lightning and rain!
We were scared!
It wasn't...
what you said.
Oh, Piggy!
It was an accident.
He was batty.
He asked for it.
It was an accident.
Oh, God,
I want to go home.
Ow!
Ow! Ow!
Take him away!
Tomorrow, I'll hunt again.
Then we'll leave another head
for the beast.
Some of you will stay
and defend the gate.
The beast may try
and come in.
Remember how he crawled ?
He came disguised.
The beast may try and come,
even though we gave him
the head of our kill to eat.
So watch and be careful.
But didn't we--
Didn't we--
No. How could we kill it ?
He told us.
The beast was disguised.
Tomorrow, when we get meat,
we'll have a feast.
- Chief?
- Yes, Bill ?
What'll we use
to light the fire ?
We'll get fire
from the others.
We've got to get
out of this.
What do you mean ?
Get rescued.
I mean it.
If we don't get out of here soon,
we'll be barmy.
- Around the bend.
- Crackers.
Have you written a letter
to your auntie lately ?
I don't know
where she is now,
and I haven't got
an envelope or a stamp,
and there isn't
a pillar box or a postman.
I haven't said
anything very funny.
Piggy-y-y-y!
Piggy!
Don't make a sound.
We're going
to get you, Piggy.
Piggy ?
Where are you, Piggy ?
- We've come to get you.
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Piggy, you've changed!
Piggy!
I just take the conch
to say this.
I can't see
without my glasses,
and I got to get them back.
What are we going to do ?
Hey! Who goes there ?
Stop being silly!
You can see who I am!
I'm calling an assembly!
Boo! Boo!
Don't leave me, Ralph!
You sit down
and wait for me. Here.
What do you want ?
Go away, Ralph!
You keep to your end.
This is my end and my tribe.
You have to leave me alone.
You took Piggy's specs.
You've got to give them back.
Got to ? Who says ?
I say!
That was a dirty trick.
We would have given you fire
if you asked for it.
But you didn't.
You came sneaking up like a thief.
- Say that again!
- Thief! Thief!
Who's a thief?
You are!
Ralph!
Remember what we came for.
The fire. My specs.
Don't you see ? There may be
a ship out there or a plane!
- Grab 'em!
-Jack!
Tie 'em up!
See ?
They do what I want.
You're a beast and a swine
and a bloody, bloody thief!
Boo! Boo!
Go, Jack! Go!
Let me speak!
I've got the conch!
Which is it better to be ?
A pack of panting savages
like you are...
or sensible like Ralph is ?
- Which is better?
To have rules and agree,
or to hunt and kill?
