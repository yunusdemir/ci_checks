Six murders. An epidemic.
Six in three weeks, within half a mile.
All women, all young.
What a waste.
I promised tonight
to take my girl to the Plaza.
My theory is,
this man has certain standards.
He always leaves a neat corpse.
He likes order.
He's a man of principle.
He prepares his corpses
as if they were lying in state.
It's one man alright.
Soldana!
Nothing! Nothing!
Not even one little clue.
Nothing again!
- Ready?
- Not now!
Nobody saw anything.
Nobody heard anything.
Idiots! Idiots!
Right under their noses.
This man is going to
decimate the whole area.
I just can't understand it.
Criminal walking the streets.
Nobody sees him.
I have to do everything myself.
Go away. What do you want?
- I want to get through please.
- You can't get through. Beat it.
I live here. I have to go in
and eat my dinner.
Why didn't you say so. Go in
and have your dinner and stop gawping.
Why do you keep doing that?
Making marks in a book won't help us.
Ah ah ah, Paco.
Good evening Papa.
We agreed you were
not to do that again, didn't we?
- He was bending over.
- That's a temptation, not a reason.
Yes Papa. It was a policeman.
- Even more reason.
- He was rude to me.
- He was?
- He pushed me.
Well, too late now.
What are you using for ammunition?
The marbles you bought me.
I haven't done anybody though.
Just the tin cans.
Except in emergencies.
- I brought you a present.
- You did?
Well almost.
It's a germium.
Yes... A germium.
A rare flower that only grows at night
on the left side of the river.
Sometimes it's mistakenly called
a geranium.
- Its a mess now.
- I think we can save it before it dies.
Come in and get a broom.
I'll find a tin can.
Father, how much is
four American 25 cent pieces?
Almost nine pesos, why?
Come in, the door is open.
Why do you ask that?
- I earned 4 American 25 cent pieces.
- You did? Doing what?
- Nothing.
- You don't get money for nothing.
I polish the cars for
the American tourists. They pay me.
- Here Papa.
- Good. Put it in the bank.
- Antonio, I would like to talk to you.
- Tell me what she told you to tell me.
- I'll clean up the mess.
- Alright.
You know the boy is filthy.
He needs someone to take care of him.
Carmen is a perfect mother.
She wants a child, let us have him.
I know.
He should be brought up right.
You owe it to the boy.
- And you can see him when you want to.
- Very generous of you.
- And you will be more free to work.
- I can't work without Paco.
- Pretty good. Can you play it?
- A little.
Very good. Fine.
- A guitar is better.
- A guitar is also more expensive.
Perhaps tomorrow you can find a guitar.
You would play better than he.
You know what?
With the money you've earned today
we now have enough to buy the surprise.
Surprise? The guitar?
- Will you get it tonight?
- Exactly.
Papa, you know
I can be good without the surprise.
You don't believe there's enough money?
I could buy a whole orchestra
Buy? You couldn't even buy
the squeaky high note of a violin.
Don't worry Paco.
You shall have your guitar.
I will look around on my way to work.
- It's almost time. You'll be late.
- It's alright.
All the others are late tonight.
No one will notice.
Good night Paco.
See you in the morning.
Carmen... Carmelita.
- Antonio has lost his job.
- What is all this play acting?
- Doesn’t the boy know you lost your job?
- He'll have all his life to worry.
about jobs and money.
He shouldn't worry about mine.
Wonderful. Meanwhile he can eat
the melodies you compose. Is that it?
I take care of Paco as well as I can.
I'll work again.
Antonio, please be sensible.
You know how she always wanted children.
- The good Lord never favored her.
- Speak for yourself, not for the Lord.
Paco needs a stable home life,
then he won't grow up like...
- Like me?
- Haven't you seen you can't manage?
I make the same promise I've made
since the boy's mother died.
Let him live with us.
We will move away. Find a place.
I love Paco. Paco loves me.
And he will stay with me.
I don't want to plead like Andre does,
But you are bad for Paco.
You're crazy. You're not good.
- You can't even hold a job.
- Not so loud.
You forgot your lunchbox, Papa.
Thank you Paco.
Goodnight.
I have an idea.
On a festival day, a father and
his son should celebrate together.
I'll tell you what. You know
the little cafe we were last Sunday?
The Cafe los Alpes?
Tonight at 10 o'clock,
when it's time for coffee
I'll meet you there and bring a guitar.
How's that?
You don't have to get me a guitar Papa.
Why not?
There are more important
things than a guitar.
They'll take me away from you
because you are poor.
No. They don't mean any harm.
I am poor.
Well, you're not growing up right.
But they won't sing with me or
teach me music like you do.
- There are lots of things you love.
- To be a musician is to be poor.
But you always said
it means to be happy.
I won't let them
take that away from you.
Tonight I will bring you a guitar.
It will be our secret pact.
No matter where I am it will always
tell you to love music and...
- I hope to love me too.
- Yes Papa.
Here, take my watch.
Ten o'clock, the cafe.
Our date.
Put on your jacket
before you go on the roof.
And enjoy the fireworks.
You will have your guitar tonight.
Antonio...
It's cruel to tease him
about the guitar.
- I'm not teasing, I'll get it.
- With what? I can't help you.
- Carmen won't let me.
- I haven't asked have I?
- How you going to get the money?
- I'll get it... I'll get it.
I'm coming.
I've been rehearsing.
The room's such a mess.
Antonio, I've missed you.
That's started again.
Antonio and the girl.
A dancer. Andre!
I'll start proceedings
tomorrow morning.
Come in whilst I get ready.
- How's your job?
- I lost it.
The linotype machine broke.
Why the lunch box?
So Paco won't know.
Carla... I hate to do this.
I have something to ask you.
I waited, but...
I need the money I loaned you.
That's why you came.
I don't have it.
- You and Paco can eat here.
- No. It isn't that.
It's just that
I've promised Paco a guitar.
I know where there's a good
second hand one, but...
I need 200 pesos.
- 200 pesos for a guitar?
- I promised him. His heart's set on it.
What do you think I'm made of, money?
- And you'll give it away for a guitar.
- But you're working now and...
- I have waited.
- You've waited?
You've disappeared. For weeks.
And now you come here.
Asking for 200 pesos for a guitar.
- When you barely have enough to eat.
- We eat! We eat!
I only came to ask for Paco.
Paco! Like you care for Paco.
Let him run all day
like a wild pig in a street.
No one can say that about Paco.
He's the most important thing in my life
And I didn't come here to beg or steal
for Paco, for me.
- I'm only asking for my own money.
- Antonio!
I'm sorry... I'm selfish.
I've missed you so.
500 pesos.
My debt.
I thought by keeping the money
I'd bring you back. I know it's worse.
It's no use.
It's just no use.
It isn't your fault you don't love me.
You should get married Antonio.
Find a nice girl.
Someone who could really
be a good mother to Paco.
Not just a cheap dancer like me.
Whatever you do is not cheap.
You're a lovely woman Carla.
I wouldn't know what else to do anyway.
Fools! Fools!
Look what you're doing!
Go to bed old man and have your pillow.
That's all you can have.
You! Go to bed and be quiet.
- What is it?
- What is wrong? What happened?
Across there. The dancer.
- Call the police!
- Order!
Stop that pounding!
Quiet! Quiet everybody!
- I am in charge here.
- Quickly, there has been another murder
To think, all this time.
Right here in the building.
The murderer, Antonio Gomez!
Gomez! Gomez!
What did Gomez do?
I won't have any murdering here.
This is a respectable building.
He was the murderer.
Stop it!
Don't touch anything
until the police call.
Are you sure it was Antonio Gomez?
Gomez always had a bad temper.
- His lunch box is outside.
- Where's Paco?
- Here in my building?
- Why are the police so slow?
There it is!
Now I've got him.
Let's get Paco.
I saw Paco go up on the roof.
He went up to watch the fireworks.
I heard him tell Paco
to meet him in a cafe.
Hey Senor, before he escapes.
Hey, it's Gomez's son. You come with us.
Where is your father?
- Let him go. Where's the apartment?
- Right over here. Come with me.
Please give me a little bit more.
They are not very ordinary rings.
A sapphire Senora.
Perhaps you were told
it was a sapphire.
I know it's a sapphire.
At least 3,000 pesos.
600. I will give you 600.
I couldn't live very long on that.
Won't you please make it a thousand?
I'm not here to see
that you live Senorita.
I'll give you 650
out of the goodness of my heart.
How about this guitar?
Have you changed you mind,
you great lover of mankind?
Go away. I'm tired of
haggling with you over the guitar.
- The price is the same.
- 200 pesos?
200 pesos? No!
It hasn't shrunk, nor has the price.
300. I'm not giving this away.
I'm trying to stay in business.
I will give you 200 out of
the goodness of my heart. No more.
On the magnificent day,
that you have 200 pesos
I will take it.
If only to get rid of you.
Where d'you get this?
You get me in trouble with the police.
I sold the Palace of Fine Arts
to an American tourist.
That's a good tune, don't you think?
Come now Lucrecia. Today is
a holiday and this lovely girl is sad.
Buy her sapphire at a fair price
and stop glowering.
Go away! Get that
dreadful blinking thing and go away!
I know a shop that will give you twice
what Aunt Lucrecia offers.
- Where is this shop?
- I'll take you there.
I'll give you 750 pesos
and not a centavo more.
That's ridiculous.
I'll give her a thousand myself.
No, no no! What are you doing?
This is my shop.
I'll do the buying and selling.
- I will give you a thousand.
- A thousand?
Come Senorita, to the other shop.
Dona Lucrecia doesn't know
a great sapphire when she sees one.
1150!
And don't say another word.
Not another word.
Thank you.
You're a good woman.
- Thank you. You did that very well.
- You're welcome.
- Is there another shop by the way?
- Who knows.
Here we're squabbling for money
and there's that bird again.
Where? So it goes.
- You were very kind. Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Senorita. Do you know
what I almost did?
I almost walked away
without knowing your name.
Many people don't know my name.
But I wouldn't know
where to find you again.
- Why should you find me?
- To help with another transaction maybe
- I have nothing more to transact.
- Are you out of work too?
Yes I'm out of work. I was fired.
All the troubles
come to the nice people.
I wasn't nice enough.
That's my trouble.
Now, don't be bitter.
Bitter!
You know a big city's
a very lonely place.
You'll find a job again.
- It's hard when you've been fired.
- Then why not get married.
Because nobody asked me.
- That's the way it goes. Here.
- Who cares?
A knife again, doctor?
Five deep cuts.
Sorry.
- I haven't slept in days.
- Too much work huh?
No. I fell in love with a younger woman.
- Why don't you marry her.
- She would kill me.
How many other happy ways
are there to die, Doc?
That's a good question Senor.
This one for instance,
died very unhappily.
Some time between 8 and 8:30.
- Well, goodnight.
- Doc. Try some sleeping pills,
She refuses to take them.
- What do you know about the murder?
- I heard the disturbance.
I am Andreas Martinez.
I am with the city.
A terrible noise and
I came out to put a stop to it,
And then my wife saw the body.
- Did you recognize Gomez' lunch box.
- Definitely!
- We saw him come in.
And my wife will verify.
Certainly. I will verify.
Listen here I said to Antonio.
You'll make a criminal of that boy.
That's beside the point.
Did you see him strike the girl
or frighten her?
A terrible fight.
He's a very bad temper,
I've always said that.
Tonight I said to Antonio...
We will take the custody of that boy
because you are worthless.
You know we have no children.
And that criminal
has his son going to waste.
Carmelita please, please Carmelita.
Your problems I understand since
I am also an official of the city.
Alright everybody..
Go on, go to bed.
I will talk to Martinez,
but without the wife.
Send her to bed,
Tell him about the adoption, please?
You may go to bed. Your husband
will come with us and tell all he knows.
Don't worry honey.
I'll take care of everything.
Let's get started on Gomez.
Send out a general order,
Let's pick him up before
he kills somebody else.
Please Mister help.
That man, he's a murderer.
A murderer? Where?
There. That man, he killed a woman.
They think my father did it.
- You're father did it?
- No my father didn't do it.
- He did it,
- I don't like the game you're playing.
Come on. See the parade.
Hello, police?
Well, speak up, this is the police.
Hello, hello.
Everybody's celebrating.
Report broken call box 121,
to communications repair.
- Please Mister, help me.
- I have no money, I'm poor myself.
- That man, he's a murderer.
- Leave me alone.
This is not a time for jokes.
Go home. Go to bed.
Oh, I'll bet Paco likes that one.
Paco's my son.
His name is Francisco.
Must be good to have a son.
You're lucky.
Is your wife out watching
the fireworks with your son?
My wife is dead.
She died three years ago.
Paco's a good boy,
Open up, please, Mister,
Is that something you composed?
It's a nice song.
It has a... little sadness.
But it's a nice song.
The sadness is mine.
I killed my wife with my poverty. I...
I didn't have the money
for her special medical care.
It's a fault not to have money.
- But whose?
- My neighbor tells me it's mine.
Maybe composing music
is a form of insanity. I don't know.
Remember what you said.
Don't be bitter,
Maybe they're right.
Maybe I am crazy.
Do you know why I lost my job?
I work for a music publisher.
Behind a linotype machine.
Printing music,
I took a hammer and I smashed it.
I did.
I couldn't stand the sight of that
mechanical monster's
thousands of sheets of bad music.
So I smashed it.
Sometimes I lose my confidence.
It was a job.
A good job, you know.
I couldn't hold it.
It was security for my son.
Antonio.
Security comes with love, doesn't it?
You can believe in that.
In your talent.
I like that.
- Does it have a name?
- Oh, yes, yes of course. It's called...
Her name is... Walking with...
- Maria.
- Maria.
Whose eyes are soft
and dark and understanding.
Reflecting the light from the stars,
The whole town is celebrating tonight,
and here I am
moaning at the bottom of a well.
Shall we go and have a glass of wine
and celebrate something? - Yes.
Let's celebrate because we met.
Senor.
Can I ask you a favor?
That's what I call a nice song.
Could you play it again for me?
Why of course.
- Driver, let me out, I must get off.
- Do you want to bust the door in?
You better watch out.
You'll hurt yourself.
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Are you following me?
Isn't it a little late
for you to be out?
Let me go I have to go meet my father.
He'll be waiting.
Waiting where?
At the Cafe los Alpes at ten o'clock.
Ten o'clock?
It's almost eleven.
I mean eleven. I have to meet
my father at eleven.
There's still plenty of time.
- Why are you so nervous?
- I'm not nervous, I just have to go.
There's no need to hurry.
There's plenty of time.
Wait!
Where is this cafe?
I'll go along with you.
I'm all alone.
I don't know anybody, only you.
- I can find it myself,
- I'll keep you company.
Don't I know you from somewhere?
You know it's funny
how I remember faces.
Then again I don't know.
I come from the States.
I'd better go now, may father will
be waiting. - I'll keep you company.
- But I know the way.
- It's better not to be alone.
Pick up order.
Urgent.
A man named Gomez.
Antonio Gomez. For murder.
Wine to make the feet lighter
and the heart dance,
Just wait till you meet him
He's a giant, and wonderful.
Four feet ten inches
and completely without fear.
Paco Francisco Gomez,
my best composition.
No, I'll get drunk
and then Paco won't like me.
Don't worry, we'll
only get drunk with joy
and Paco will love you.
You know...
Sometimes loneliness is up here.
Not here.
Sometimes a sentence understood
is more important than an embrace.
Take the embrace, old man,
and let understanding come by itself.
I hope you're not telling me a lie.
- How old are you?
- Ten.
Ten...
That's sad.
You'll grow up to be
cruel and ugly and...
Well you,
you aren't so pretty yourself.
That's what I mean,
you'll grow up to...
to harm and to hurt people.
You're hurting me all the time
and it doesn't hurt you.
But I'm punishing people.
God punishes people and I'm helping him.
He can't watch people all the time.
Somebody has to help him, Right?
Antonio...
What a wonderful man.
- I'm floating.
- So am I.
And I'll say it's time
for you to go home now.
No.
Where's Paco?
The streets are crowded.
It must have taken him longer.
- What time is it?
- I don't know. I haven't a watch either
I pawned it last week.
All women, no matter
what time it is, will wait for you.
Tell me more about Paco.
You're wonderful... wonderful,
This is the first time
in my life I wish I could sing.
The music is in my head.
I can hear it clearly, but...
It comes out noise.
Paco will be a much better
musician than I am.
He will play the guitar.
He will make it...
The guitar!
I left the guitar back at the stand
where we bought the...
Oh what a fool.
Here...
Don't move. Wait for me. I'll be right
back. I promised to bring him a guitar.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Could you tell me the time please?
- Almost ten to eleven.
- Thank you.
Quiet!
You're smart huh?
- I'm smarter than you are.
- Where are you taking me?
To the cafe.
To prove that you're a liar.
You better not do anything to me.
Besides, it's not fair.
You're big and I'm little.
I give up.
Pedro, report this box.
Number 214
If he's the same one all the time,
he must be lost.
He keeps circling.
A regular crooks tour of the city.
How long can you get to repair?
Box 214.
Get there and repair it.
I'm sorry Garcia.
I'm not breaking them.
Give here.
So, he's breaking them faster than you
can repair. What else have you got to do?
Oh boy oh boy oh boy.
- Where is he?
- I'm too little, I can't see.
Where's your father,
you little liar?
Maybe he forgot.
He promised he would be here,
It was to be our last party together.
What's your name?
Francisco. Francisco Gomez.
- But nobody calls me that.
- What do they call you?
- Just Paco.
- Paco.
You should be punished Paco, for lying,
For staying out late at night.
- Let's go.
- Where are you taking me?
To your house where you belong.
Where do you live?
- Home? To my father?
- Certainly. Why not?
46 Calle Masones. A large
apartment house on the second floor,
Thanks,
I knew I'd seen you before.
You followed me from that house.
You see his papa is angry.
That's what happens to bad little boys.
Come on.
You're like all the rest.
Dirty and evil. Do anything for money.
Yes. You wanted the reward,
and now you must be punished.
- I don't care for any reward.
- Then why were you following me?
I don't want my father to get the blame.
There is no blame.
I returned her to heaven clean.
Her arms folded in prayer.
Asking for mercy.
- Where are we going now?
- The church of Santa Maria.
- What for?
- You will pray.
- What will you do?
- Listen to his voice.
He will tell me what to do.
- Has something happened to Paco?
- Sit down,
I must insist.
Why have I been brought up here?
Like a dog you pick up
on the street, like a criminal.
- I was simply looking for my son.
- I am Justin Saldana.
I already know you have
a violent temper.
There is no need to prove it to me.
Sit down.
Sorry, I'm sorry. I'm upset.
- But I must know about my boy.
- We will get to the boy.
Perhaps he went home.
I didn't think of that.
- Perhaps he's home in bed.
- I'm afraid not,
You know that?
How do you know that?
Please, we are wasting time.
Sit down.
Sit down!
Where have you been since you left home
just before 8:00 with a lunchbox?
To go to a non-existent job.
Where is the lunchbox?
I don't know.
- Is this it?
- Yes, that's it.
Must have forgotten it some place.
I want you to tell me
every move you made tonight.
From the time you left your own place.
Alright.
I left...
I said goodbye to my neighbors,
I heard Paco playing a tune on
a little harmonica he found.
He's good.
He got the tune from me,
and d'you know I only played it once.
I decided to see...
an old friend of mine.
A girl in the same building
and borrow some money.
Money that I had loaned her.
To buy Paco a guitar.
- We talked.
- You just talked? You didn't fight?
We fought a little. We...
- Always do. Always have.
- and then what?
She gave me the money.
Then I went to see a man about a job.
But he wasn't home,
So I went to a pawn shop I know,
and bought Paco the guitar.
In the pawn shop I met
a very nice girl.
- What pawn shop? Where is it?
- In er...
Calle Tropo.
The owner calls herself Dona Lucrecia.
Very disagreeable woman.
The girl was trying to pawn this ring.
And Dona Lucrecia wouldn't
give her a price.
The man's wife, she follows Rincon
all the time. She likes him.
There's a pick up for Soldana and
a woman called Dona Lucrecia.
She runs a pawn shop on Calle Tropo.
Might live there. Send the closest car.
How are your call boxes?
Your friend still playing games?
Nothing for the last half hour.
Makes me nervous,
- Probably gone to bed.
- Garcia thinks it's kids now.
He found this in the last one.
Marbles.
Come on, it's a rush order,
Son, keep praying,
How about the voices?
- Have they said anything about me yet?
- Don't disturb my prayer,
Excuse me.
Paco, come here.
Perhaps you can tell us where
to reach her to verify all this.
No I can't.
The other one.
Your old friend.
- Do you know her name.
- Oh, yes.
Of course I've known her a long time.
She works in a club.
The Trajita. Her name is Carla.
Carla Arlota.
Her name was Carla Arlota.
- What?
- You didn't know she was dead?
- No.
- She was killed tonight.
Murdered at about 8:30
according to the doctor.
No, no!
You're lying to me.
Is it possible?
I just saw her.
I saw her too.
She was stabbed.
Five times.
Let me go!
Let me go!
You know, this is a very, very
serious charge against you.
I don't care.
Captain Soldana is not the kind of man
to let go of a thing like this.
I'm not worried about myself.
I had nothing to do with it.
But my son.
He's just a little boy.
Sometimes I forget that you know.
I should never have
left him alone tonight.
- Isn't there some...
- I'll tell you what I'll do...
You give me his description
and I'll put it out for you.
Don't forget it's you
Soldana is interested in.
A description.
Well...
Paco is... small for his age.
He er...
He's about 4 feet ten.
Perhaps 70 pounds.
He's wearing... blue jeans.
Sweater...
And a leather jacket.
- Hello Andre.
- Hello Antonio.
Thank you for helping me.
I came back when I heard
that... that you were here.
I thought maybe the boy was with you.
And you know, we're taking the boy.
He's going to be ours
as soon as he can be found.
The captain agreed.
I just came to let you know
and take the kid with me.
You're involved too deep.
It won't be good for the boy.
You know that Antonio.
- But he's lost.
- I know that, poor boy.
But if they find him,
he will be ours.
If!... If!... IF!
You're standing there telling me
If they find him!
Go out, find him if you care for him.
Look everywhere.
Lieutenant. You have to let me go.
I will find him.
I should never have
left him alone tonight.
There never has been
any trouble in my shop.
I have never accepted stolen money.
May my poor husband's body
turn in his grave if I am lying.
I will show you my records.
So...
You are at the bottom of all this.
I'll fix that
pretty little face of yours.
I'll teach you how to trick me.
Murderers! Thieves!
- She's his partner.
- Quiet please.
- Paco is lost.
- I said quiet!
What is your name?
Maria Ibinia.
I'm a friend of Antonio Gomez.
- I heard he was in trouble so I came.
- Trouble?
He's in plenty of trouble.
He's suspected of murder.
that's impossible,. This man's not
capable of murder. I know him.
How long have you known him?
I met him tonight at the pawn shop.
Then you must know him very well.
You don't have to know somebody
a long time to know them well.
I was with him tonight.
We danced.
- He told me about his son, his music.
- Let the facts get to the man.
He's irresponsible,
disorganized. Emotional.
All characteristics of a murderer.
You've convicted him already
haven't you? Why?
Because he's not like you. You don't
understand him. He's an artist.
- Those are the only facts you have.
- Senorita!
Please answer only the questions
that are addressed to you.
She came with him.
She's his accomplice.
He is a thief, a murderer.
Where'd he get so much money?
Money coming out of his pockets.
I saw with my own eyes.
He tricked me into
selling him the guitar.
He tricked me into buying
this girl's stolen ring.
I didn't know it was stolen, honest...
Senora, nobody is accusing you
of receiving stolen goods.
Nobody is accusing you of anything.
You were simply asked to establish
a matter of time. Do you understand?
Now think clearly before you answer.
Exactly at what time
was he in your shop?
I was going to close at six.
I was going to close
earlier on a holiday.
I didn't close until 8:30.
Just before that.
If I'd only closed a minute sooner.
Doctor!
- Doctor...
- Excuse me.
Is it possible the girl
was killed later than you thought?
Perhaps at nine o'clock
or before eight?
No.
Impossible. Medically impossible.
If it had been later than that, she...
- Get her out of here.
- Alright Senora.
Lieutenant, where did you get that?
Where did it come from?
The marble?
It looks like one of Paco's. I bought
him two dozen like that last week.
- What is all this?
- The marble Garcia brought in.
- From one of the broken boxes.
- That's one of Paco's.
It looks like
a common, ordinary marble.
But it's white. He insisted.
I looked all over. Red, blue.
Everything but white.
Just one shop had white.
He uses them in his slingshot.
He shoots at tin cans.
He was shooting at
police property tonight.
No, he wouldn't do that.
I've explained to him.
Just a minute. Let me explain
something to you Senor.
I am still conducting an investigation.
I'm concerned with murder, not marbles.
And I'm concerned with my son
and what's happened to him.
That's more important to me
than all your investigations.
Your son... where would
he have been around 8:30?
8:30?
The roof probably.
I told him he could go up
to watch the...
The roof...
- He could have seen.
- Come with me.
I haven't released him yet Fernando.
- Where do you think you're going?
- To communications.
- Are you crazy?
- No, he's not crazy.
If this marble is Paco's then
he's been trying to reach the police.
- He's not crazy at all.
- It's worthwhile looking into.
Get me the lights.
All the boxes that were broken tonight.
Doesn't follow a course.
Like somebody wandering around the city,
like I wander around at night.
Or the way the murderer does.
Now the lights again, but
in the order the boxes were broken.
121.
Calle Mesones. Our street.
He could have started from there.
168.
that one's heading for
the Cafe los Alpes.
He was trying to get to you.
That's it. That's all.
It's beginning to make sense.
There is a pattern.
Ending at the church square.
- The fireworks.
- There's no proof it wasn't a drunk.
The repair work's over.
The call box expert lost his tool.
They're Paco's.
These are Paco's.
- Where were they found?
- Besides box 94.
Light box 94.
The church square.
We were checking the boxes.
That one was alright.
It spoils your theory.
Because if the Gomez boy
has been following someone,
and is breaking boxes to
attract our attention,
why stop?
Why not break this one too?
Maybe he couldn't.
Didn't have time.
He dropped the slingshot.
Someone went after him.
It's possible.
We had a report about a man
and a boy, too close to the fireworks.
They disappeared before
the guards could get to them.
That was Paco.
My son is with a murderer
and I'm doing nothing.
- I'm going out to find...
- Gomez!
We've got 500 men out there
looking for your boy.
They're in touch with us
by radio and by phone.
If you want to wander around
like a blind man, then go on.
But if you really want to help,
then stay here.
You're the only one
who really knows the boy.
What a vast city for a little boy.
I'm hungry.
Buenos dias.
Antonio...
I've been watching you all night.
Now I know that love for a child...
is not only joy...
is pain and sorrow.
Maybe we are too old, Carmelita and I,
to learn that.
I will tell Carmelita
what a father you will be.
If he comes back.
Poor Carmelita.
She's been dreaming so much
about a son.
I'm hungry.
Paco will be getting hungry now.
I always came home at five
when I was working.
He'd wake up.
We'd have breakfast together.
It became a habit for the two of us.
then after I lost my job,
I would wander around the city.
Pretending.
Just so I would be home at five
for our little meal together.
You know, habits are very funny.
they stay with you.
It may sound crazy, but I have
an idea that might be our only chance.
They were last seen around
the Plaza Santa Maria.
They might still be around there,
hiding somewhere.
They have to eat.
Here, let me have the phone book.
I'll mark some places out for you.
Get on the phone and start calling.
Let's call restaurants, bars, cafes.
Every place around the Plaza.
They'll be opening soon.
And they might get to one of them.
A man and a boy about ten.
If they've been in, ask at what time.
Tell them that if anyone like that
walk in, to call us right away.
We might have a chance.
- I'm hungry.
- Stop that.
- I'm hungry.
- Stop it!
I'm hungry.
Hello. Who?
What? The police?
You want to know if I have seen what?
What boy?
No. Nobody like that.
No children come in here.
I wouldn't know anything about it.
I've just opened up.
I'm expecting a telephone call,
so if the phone rings I'll answer it.
- A call here?
- That's what I said.
Don't get touchy buddy.
Go ahead.
- We're looking for a 10 year old boy.
- No? Thank you.
We believe he's with a man,
but there's no description.
A man with a ten year old boy.
You're never really scared are you?
You're strong.
I'm always lonely.
Nobody to talk to.
Always running.
Are you listening to me?
When I am with you Paco...
I feel safe.
Will you be my friend Paco?
Hello?
Yes, this is the Mercado restaurant.
No I'm all here by myself.
No, that's just the radio you hear.
No, no. Nobody here
by that description.
No I'm not open yet. No.
Antonio, that song
you played for me last night?
- The one you wrote, I just heard it.
- You did?
At the last cafe, the Mercado.
On the radio.
But I only finished it last night.
No one knows it but you and...
And Paco.
I played part of it for him at dinner.
Then later I heard him
playing it on a harmonica he found.
- It was a harmonica.
- What cafe?
The Mercardo. Right here.
- Pedro, give me 21, 78, 28.
- Yes sir.
Hello, this is the police department.
We just called you now.
I want to know
who just answered the phone.
No, I just want to know
who answered the phone.
You did? A man and a boy?
Did you see which way they went?
No! Don't do anything.
Just go and
cook yourself some breakfast.
They left three minutes ago.
The owner was in the kitchen
and didn't see which way they went.
Get me radio patrol.
If Paco is alive, I'll buy him
the biggest guitar in the world.
Hello? Soldana.
I want every car you've got, the Plaza
Santa Maria, Mercardo restaurant, fast.
Don't hang up.
Listen. No sirens.
Tell them to close in very carefully.
To keep their eyes open.
I'll personally shoot
anybody who uses a gun.
We'll be there in five minutes.
Do me a favor.
Go to lost and found.
And get the best guitar you can find.
Send it to me with one of the boys...
I hope he'll be able to use it.
What are we waiting for?
Why can't we leave?
I have a schedule Senor.
When it is late, we're late.
When? What time?
The moment has come Senor.
The bus that just left.
Did you see any passengers?
Passengers? No.
I don't think...
Wait. there was one.
A man.
A man with a little boy.
Keep going. Don't stop.
I said, don't stop!
Keep the damn thing closed.
- They'll never catch us.
- You're crazy.
Don't ever say that to me.
I thought you were my friend.
We kids always say that.
It doesn't mean you're really crazy.
One way street!
- Have you seen a man and a little boy?
- They went across to the university.
- Someone is stabbed in the bus.
- Call an ambulance. - Yes Sir.
Sergeant Yulan reporting.
He saw them get off the bus.
- They're heading for the university.
- Just now.
He's using the kid as a shield.
All men proceed with caution.
Surround this area, then go.
You men spread out here.
You boys go over there.
Alright. Let's go.
Over there!
I can't breathe.
I've been running.
Follow my line.
You are young and strong.
You must be my friend Paco!
I need one friend.
Watch out!
He's using the boy as a shield.
Paco!
Antonio, come back!
He'll kill you!
Stop!
Or I'll kill the boy.
We're going up the medical building
through the ramp.
You close in on them
from your position.
Is that OK with you?
Alright.
Stop, or I'll kill you too.
Let me handle this.
Paco! Get back!
Get back!
It's alright Paco.
It's alright now.
He wanted to be my friend.
He was afraid.
We're strange, frightening creatures.
Why does it lie in our grasp to...
build such beautiful things as these,
and yet find within us
the will to destroy.
You know, there's part of him
in all of us. Good and bad.
He was a dreamer and a wanderer.
Like you Antonio.
Certainly a child.
He was lonely.
- Full of pitiless righteousness.
- Pitiless viciousness.
Someday you will have my job Hernando.
Then you will understand
the position of the man in charge.
Who's that?
- Maria, Paco.
- She's alright. She's good and strong.
She was with me all night,
looking for you.
I've been looking for both of you...
All my life.
Thank you. Thank you.
- Where are we going now?
- Home.
46 Calle Mesones.
