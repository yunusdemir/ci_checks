He hit me.
Did you hit him back?
Good.

Never start a fight,always finish it.
Why'd he hit you?
Because I hit him.
You hit him first?
Why?
He said my dad ran offbecause he didn't like me.
Honey, your fathernever met you,
so how could henot like you?
Then why did he leave?
Well, because the dayyou were born,
something elsearrived in the mail.
And it was in a boxa little bit biggerthan you.
You know what was in it?
Something calledresponsibility.
And to some people,
responsibility isthe scariest thingin the world.

Missing child.
What's your relationto the child, ma'am?
It's my son.
How long has he been gone?
I'm not sure.I just got home from work.
It could besince this morning

since we learnedof her plight.
On the radio andin the newspapers
we are told thatthe Los AngelesPolice Department
is doing its very best toreunite mother and child,

Every day,this city sinks deeperinto a cesspool

Los Angeles has becomea place where our protectors

I'm not mistaken.
Well, he's been throughfive terrible long months.
He's lost weight,he's changed.

All I'm saying isyou're in shockand he's changed.
What's your name?Can you tell meyour name?
Walter Collins.
(SIGHS)
It's a common name.
Where do you live, Walter?You know your home address?
I live at 210 Avenue 23,
Los Angeles, California.
And that's my mommy!
Mrs. Collins, listento me. I understand.
You're feeling a littleuncertain right now,and that's to be expected.
A boy this age,he changes so fast.
We've compensated for thatin our investigation.
And there's no questionthat this is your son.
That is not Walter.
It's not Walteras you remember him.
And that's why it's importantfor you to take him homeon a trial basis.
A trial basis?
Yes, yes.
Once he's around hisfamiliar surroundings,
and you've given yourself timeto recover from the shockof his changed condition,
you will see thatthis is your Walter.
Now, I promise you,I swear to you,I give you my word.
This is your son.
Now, if you have any problems,any problems at all, youcome and you talk to me.
I'll take care of it.
I give you my word.Trust me.
Mrs. Collins, he hasnowhere else to go.
Please.
Maybe I'm notthinking clearly.

(SNIFFLES)
(GASPS)
He's not my son.
Mrs. Collins...
No, I don't know whyhe's saying that he is,
but he's not Walterand there's been a mistake.
I thought we agreedto give him timeto adjust.
He's three inches shorter.
I measured himon the chart.
Well, maybe yourmeasurements are off.
Look, I'm sure there'sa reasonable explanationfor all of this.
He's circumcised.
And Walter isn't.
Mrs. Collins.
Your son was missingfor five months.
For at least part of thattime in the company of anas yet unidentified drifter.
Who knows what sucha disturbed individualmight have done?
He could have hadhim circumcised.He could have...
Made him shorter?
Why aren't youlistening to me?
I am listening,damn it,I am listening.
And I understandyour feelings.
He's changed,no mistake,and that's...
You've both been througha terrible experience,
and that's why he needsyour love and supportto bounce back.
He's not my son!
Why are you doing this,Mrs. Collins?
Why are you doing this?
You seem perfectly capableof taking care of the boy.
Your job pays youenough to attend tohis personal needs,
so I don't understandwhy you're running away
from your responsibilitiesas a mother.
I am not running awayfrom anything!
Least of allmy responsibilities!
I am even taking careof that boy right now,
because I am all he has!
What worries me isthat you have stoppedlooking for my son!
Why should we belooking for someonewe've already found?
Because you havenot found him.
His identityhas been confirmed
by the best mindsin the field ofchild identification,
people who knowwhat they're doing.
And I don't?
(SOBS)
(SIGHS)
I'm sorry.
I appreciate everything thatthis department has done
and I knowhow hard you're working.

Captain Jones sent me.
I consult with himfrom time to timeon juvenile cases.
May I come in?
Yes, thank you for coming.
I was beginning to thinkhe didn't believe me.
Well, I'm here now,and we'll put allthat to rights.
Where's the boy?
Ah! There he is.
A handsome young man.
He has your eyes,doesn't he?
And a little bitof the nose.
Very fit, in spiteof all his travails.
A very resilient boyyou've got here,Mrs. Collins.
I thought you werehere to help me.
Well, I am.
Captain Jones said thatthe boy had been throughsome severe physical changes
and asked meto drop in on him
to reassure youin your time ofmotherly concern.
My motherly concern isnot for him becausehe's not my son.
Now, statements likethat will hardly helpthe boy's self-esteem,
now will they?
Captain Jones said somethingabout a change in height?
Yes.
Come.
Against the wall.
CHRISTINE: He'sthree inches shorter.
Ah, well...
(STAMMERING)Hardly a mystery,Mrs. Collins.
We've known for some timethat trauma can affectthe growth of children.
Given the stressof the past five months,
his spine may haveactually shrunk.
It's uncommon,but it's withinthe realm of possibility.
And circumcision?
Very likely his abductorthought it appropriate.
After all, circumcisionis hygienically sound.
Must have beenquite traumaticat the time.
No wonderhe's submerged the memory.
I...
You see, there's a perfectlysound medical explanationfor all of this.
But it's right for youto raise the questions.
You need to be apprisedof all changes the ladwent through
during his absence.
Wouldn't I knowwhether or nothe's my son?
I'm the mother.
Which meansyou're in no positionto be objective.
You are lookingthrough the prism ofextreme emotion at a boy
who has changedfrom what you remember.
He isn't the same boythat left here.
Just as a boythat goes off to warand then returns
is not the same anymore.
And a mother's heart,driven by intuitionand emotion,
sees these changesand rebels,
insists thatthis isn't your son.
Doesn't change the facts.
I'm willing to put my theoryto the test of objectivity,Mrs. Collins.
Are you?
CHRISTINE: It isabsolutely outrageous!
Calm yourself,calm yourselfand just listen to me.
No, no, no.No, you listen to me, please.
This so called doctorparaded me aroundmy own neighborhood,
like some kind of aderelict mother who didn'teven know her own son.
JONES: And whatwas his findings?
He found what heexpected to find,
what you obviouslytold him he would find.
Mrs. Collins.But that's not...
That's nothingto be embarrassed about.
That I was embarrassedis not the issue.
The point is thatyou are wasting time
when you should belooking for my son.
But the report is final,Mrs. Collins.
Well, then I want toreceive the report,so I can refute it,
before it goesto anyone else.
Fine.
Yes. Good day.
(SNIFFLES)
I'm finished. Could Igo to my room now?
Yes.
Good night, Mommy.
Stop saying that!
Stop saying that!
I'm not your mother!
I want my son back.
You're not him.You're not my son!
I want my son back.
I want my son back!
Damn you!
I want my son back!
(SOBS)
I was wrongto yell at you.
You're just a child
and I don't think you knowwhat you're doing,
and the hurtyou're causing.
But I need you to understandthat my son is my life.
He's all I have.
(SNIFFLES)
And no matter what thepolice think, and no matterwhat the world thinks,
you and I,
we both know the truth,don't we?
We both know thatyou're not Walter.
You just have to tell themthat you're not my son,
so they can find my son.

(PHONE CLICKS)
Hello?
(MUMBLING)"Mysterious case of...
"Acting on the requestof the Los AngelesPolice Department,
"Dr. Earl W. Tarr,child specialist,examined Walter Collins
"to determine the causeof his loss of weight,
"paleness, confusion,and rundown condition
"noticed since thereturn of the boy
(CLEARS THROAT)"To his mother last Monday."
Lovely bit of phrasing,isn't it?
Noticed since the returnof the boy to his mother.
Now, not only doesthat clearly stateyou're the boy's mother,
but one could inferfrom it that you're somehowresponsible for these changes.
And that the policedepartment is concerned
for the boy's welfarewhile he's in your charge.
You should try the eggs.They're very nice.
"'I examined the boyquite thoroughly,'Dr. Tarr said,
"'And it's clear thathe has something to tell.
"'I'm sure that in time..."'
...time he will givehis boyish story ofthe entire affair,
but not until he hasfaith in his listener.
And that is whatis lacking here, faithin the poor lad's story.
Course of my examination,I found nothing todispute the findings
of the LAPD.
Why would they do this?
To avoid admittingthey made a mistake
when they broughtback the wrong boy.
Of course, anyonereading the newspaperwith half a brain
would seethrough it instantly.
Sadly, that wouldexclude about half thereadership of the Times.
Mrs. Collins, I have made itmy mission in life to bringto light all the things
the LAPD wish noneof us ever knew about.
A department ruled byviolence, abuse, murder,corruption and intimidation.
When Chief Davistook over the forcetwo years ago, he said...
We will hold courtagainst gunmen in thestreets of Los Angeles.
I want them broughtin dead, not alive,
and I will reprimand anyofficer who shows theleast mercy to a criminal.
He picked 50 of the mostviolent cops on the force,
gave them machine gunsand permission to shootanyone who got in their way.
He called themthe Gun Squad.
(GUNFIRE)
No lawyers, no trials,no questions, no suspensions,no investigations.
Just piles of bodies.
Bodies in the morgues, bodiesin the hospitals, bodiesby the side of the road.
And not becausethe LAPD wantedto wipe out crime. No.
The LAPD wanted towipe out the competition.
Mayor Cryer and halfthe force are on the take.
Gambling, prostitution,bootlegging, you name it.
Because once you givepeople the freedom todo whatever they want,
as the Lord foundin the Garden of Eden,they will do exactly that.
This police departmentdoes not tolerate dissent,or contradiction,
or even embarrassment.
And you are in a positionto embarrass them andthey do not like it.
They will do anythingin their power todiscredit you.
I've seen that happentoo many times tostart going blind now.
That's why I wantedto meet you,
to let you know whatyou're getting yourself into
and to help you fight it,if you choose to.
Reverend, I appreciateeverything thatyou're doing
and everythingthat you said,
but I'm not on a mission.
I just want my son home.
Mrs. Collins, a lotof mothers' sons
have been sacrificedto expediency around here.
Your son, unfortunately,would not be the first.
But if you do it right,he may very well be the last.
(SIGHS)
He had two cavitiesthat needed filling.
He put up a fight,but I took care of it.
And?
Your son's upper frontteeth were separated bya small tissue, a diastema.
It made them sit aboutan eighth of an inch apart.
The boy in that roomhas no such gap.
Can that change with age?Because that's whatthey're gonna say.
In some cases,yes, it's possible.
But the tissue betweenWalter's teeth preventsthat from happening.
See, they can nevercome together without anoperation to sever the tissue,
and I can tell you rightnow that he has neverhad such an operation.
Would you be willing to putthat officially in writing?
Pardon my language,but hell yes.
(ARTHUR MOANING)
Sounds like theanesthetic's wearing off.
On the other hand,maybe I'll writethat letter first.
Give the little fellasomething to think about.
Well, if it is,he's changed enormously.
Do you know who I am?
You're a teacher.
Yes, but eventeachers have names.What's mine?
I don't remember.
I know you, but I don'tremember your name.
Mrs. Fox.Now, take your seat.
(CHILDREN LAUGHING)
I didn't say take a seat.I said take your seat,the one assigned you.
You must know where it is,you've been sitting init for over a year now.
Mrs. Collins,if that's your son,I'll eat my yardstick.
Not only will I put it inwriting, I will testifyto it in a court of law
or to the PresidentCalvin Coolidgehimself if I have to.

REPORTER 3: Mrs. Collins.
Hello. My name isChristine Collins.
Good morning.MAN: Good morning.
On March 10th,my nine-year-old son,Walter Collins, disappeared.
And a five-month investigation
led to a boy beingbrought to Los Angelesfrom DeKalb, Illinois.
They told me and all of youthat this boy was my son.
He was not my son.
The LAPD made a mistake,
and that is the reason forthe supposed transformation.
I have letters from histeachers and his doctors
all confirming thathe is not my son.
I'm having themreprinted now, and I'llhave them for you tomorrow.
I have given the LAPDevery opportunity toadmit their mistake
and renew thesearch for my son.
Since they haverefused to do so,
it has forced meto bring my case public.
And I hope that this nowwill persuade them tofinish what they started
and bring my son home to me.
Thank you very much.

Oh, you've causedus quite a bit oftrouble, Mrs. Collins.
This situation has becomean embarrassment for theentire police department.
It wasn't my intentionto embarrass anyone.
Oh, no, of course not.
You just told the papers wecouldn't tell one boy fromanother as a compliment
for the months we spentworking on your case.
You trying to makefools out of us?Is that it? You enjoy this?
Of course not.
I want you to find my son.
You know what yourproblem is, Mrs. Collins?
You're trying to shirk yourresponsibilities as a mother.
What?
You enjoyed beinga free woman,didn't you?
You enjoyed not having toworry about a young son.
You could gowhere you wanted,do whatever you wanted,
see anyone you wanted.
But then we found your son,and we brought him back.
And now he's aninconvenience to you.
And that's why youcooked up this scheme,
to throw him to thestate and get the stateto raise him for you.
Isn't that true?That is not true!
No? Well, even the boysays he's your son.
Why would he say that?
How would he knowto do that?
I don't know.I just know he's lying.
Oh, maybe so.Maybe he is a liar.
But that's howhe's been trained,isn't it?
Lying was bornin both of you.
You're a liar anda troublemaker and,if you ask me,
you got no businesswalking the streetsof Los Angeles.
Now wait a minute.
Because eitheryou know you're lying,
or you're not capableof knowing if you'relying or telling the truth.
So, which is it?
You a derelict mother?Or just plain nuts?
'Cause from where I sit,those are the only options.
I'm not gonna sithere and take this.
You want experts?You want doctors?I have a few of my own.
Matron.
Mrs. Collins, you stillinsist that the boy outthere is not your son?
Yes, I do.
Please, don't struggle.What?
No!You'll only hurt yourself.
What are you doing?Hold still.
You can't just do this.No, you can't.

That'll be $15.

Breakfast is half an hour.
Please, miss, I need tosee a doctor in charge.
The dining roomis down the hall.
The doctor willcall for youwhen he's ready.
NURSE 1: Do you wanteggs or oatmeal?
Okay, that's everyonethat's here.
All right.
You can pull the oatmeal.
NURSE 2: Do you wantit for tomorrow?
NURSE 1: You know,just dump it.NURSE 2: All right.
You should eat.
Eating is normal.
You gotta do everythingyou can to look normal.
It's the only chanceyou got.
WOMAN: I'm not hungry.
MAN: Barbara, youhave to eat now.I'm not hungry.
My name's Carol Dexter.What's yours?
Christine.Christine Collins.
Now, finish it all.I know it's hard,but you gotta try.
WOMAN: Oh, boy.
I heard them talking.
You're here on code 12?
Police action.
I mean, the doctors,the staff, they figure
that if the policebrought you here,
there must bea good reason for it.
There isn't a goodreason for it.
I'm perfectly saneand I will explainthat to them.
How?
The more you try to act sane,the crazier you start to look.
If you smile too much,you're delusional oryou're stifling hysteria.
And if you don't smile,you're depressed.
If you remain neutral,you're emotionally withdrawn,potentially catatonic.
You've given thisa lot of thought.
Yeah, I have.Don't you get it?
You're a code 12,so am I.
We're here for theexact same reasons.
We both pissedoff the cops.
Now, you see, yousee that lady there?
She was married to a copwho kept beating her up.
When she tried to tellsomebody about it,he brought her here.
WOMAN: I want more juice.
And that one?
NURSE 3: Put your trayback where it belongs.
The police beat the crapout of her brother,broke both his arms.
When she tried totell the papers...
And you?
I work nights.
WOMAN: Sure.
I mean, I work nights.
Oh.
Yeah. In the clubs.Downtown.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, well, this oneclient just kept hittingme and he wouldn't stop,
so I filed a complaint.
And it turns outhe was a cop.
Next thing I know,I'm here.
But they can't do that.
Are you kidding?
NURSE 3: All right, onemore and then that's it.
Everybody knowswomen are fragile.
I mean, they're allemotions, no logic, there'snothing going on upstairs.
PATIENT:Somebody! Help me!
Every once in a whilethey say something that'sa little inconvenient,
they just go fucking nuts.
Pardon my French.
NURSE 1: You gottaget those dishes.NURSE 2: You got it.
If we're insane,nobody has tolisten to us.
I mean, who areyou gonna believe,
some crazy womantrying to destroy theintegrity of the force,
or a police officer?
Then once they get us inhere, we either shut upand we learn to behave,
or we don't go home.

I hope your stay here hasconvinced you not to trycrossing the border

Wait!
I'd like to talk to theofficer who brought me in.
I'm sure he has farmore important things...
Please. It's important.
NURSE: Christine Collins.
Thank you. Mrs. Collins.
Dr. Jonathan Steele.Please, have a seat.
I hope your stay with ushas been comfortable so far.
Yes.
Really?
(CHUCKLES) I'd think it'dbe quite difficult at first.
Yes, it was.
Of courseit was very difficult,but comfortable enough.
(CLEARS THROAT)
(HUMMING)
I see that they have...They've taken a blood test.
The Wassermman Test.
They said it wasto check for syphilis,'cause it affects the mind.
The idea that someonethinks you need to bechecked for syphilis,
does that upset you?
No, they said it wasstandard procedure,so it did not.
Yes, exactly.Standard procedure.
We have to coverall our bases.
I can imagine
that for some peoplethat would beuncomfortable,
but I understood.
(HUMMING)
(SIGHS)
(HUMMING)
According to your fileyou believe that thepolice substituted
a fake boy for your son.
No, I didn't sayhe was a fake boy.
He's not my boy.
They brought homethe wrong boy.
My son is still missing.
Well, that's strange,because I have herea newspaper article
with a photo of youat the train station,welcoming home your son.
That is you in thephoto, isn't it?
Yes.
Yeah.
Yes.
So, at firsthe was your son,
and now he's not your son.
(CLEARS THROAT)Has this been goingon for a long time?
People changing,becoming somethingother than what they are?
People don't change.
You don't thinkpeople change?
No, that's not...
(HUSHING)
The police, they're notout to persecute you?
No, they're not.
No, they're not.
The police are hereto protect you.
Yes.
Really?
Yes.
Well, that's odd becausewhen you were admitted,
you told the head nurse thatthe police were conspiringdeliberately to punish you.
So, either the head nurseand the interns are alsoconspiring to punish you
or you're changingyour story.
(SIGHS)
Do you often have troubletelling reality fromfantasy, Mrs. Collins?
No.
I'm sorry to bring you outin this weather, Detective,
but the boy hasbeen quite insistent.
It's all right.
I'll see what he has to sayso I can go home and get dry.
It's raining cats, dogs,and Democrats out there,
so this had betterbe worth it.
You again, huh?
We'll see.
Well?
This isn't easy, okay?
Yeah?
Driving my ass herein the pouring rainwasn't easy either.
My cousin isGordon Northcott.
He owns the ranchwhere you found me.
He said I could live therein exchange I watch theplace when he's gone,
doing choresand stuff like that.
Said I could stay aslong as I wanted to.
I thought that meantI could leave wheneverI wanted.
Mmm.
You saying that heheld you prisoner?
Bull.
When I got there,you were running aroundfree as a jaybird.
Could've left anytime you wanted.
No.
So, what's this, huh?
Some kind of story tocover why you're inthe country illegally?
No, it's nothing like that.
'Cause I don't havetime for this, okay?
Listen to me!He said...
What?
What did he say?
He said that if I triedto leave, he'd kill me.
Look, you don't understandwhat he's like,
what he... What we did,what he made me do.
All right.
Let's start atthe beginning then.
What'd he make you do?
(SOBS)
We killed some kids.
What?
Look, I didn'tmean to, I swear.He made me help him.
He said if I didn't,he'd kill me, too.
Look, you gottahelp me, please.I'm so scared.
I don't want to goto hell for killing kids.
Look.
What kids?What... What areyou talking about?
I don't know.I never knew their names.
Names?
How many?
How many kids?
All together?
About 20, I guess.
No, you're lying.
No! It's true, I swear!
You're gonna tell meyou killed 20 kids?
Yeah! Thereabouts.
I stopped countingafter a while.
Gordon said maybeone or two mayhave escaped.
But...
No.
Nobody can just upand kill 20 kids, okay?
We did.
We did.
How?
Most times we'd justhave one or two.
Sometimes as many as three.
I always knew when wewere getting ready to leave.
(HUMMING)
Clean up the car.
Make sure the tireswere good.
Check the engine.
'Cause he was afraid thatthe car would break down
and we'd get caught.
(SINGING) My loving baby
We'd always go a differentdirection every time.
Never hit the samepart of town twice.
Sometimes we'd justdrive around for hours,
till we found somebody.
GORDON:Well, there you are!
We've been lookingfor you like mad.
You have?
Sure thing.
Listen, your folks,they've been inan accident.
And they sent usto come find you.Now, they're hurt real bad.
The police took them to thehospital, but they didn'thave time to come find you,
so we said thatwe would do it.
Now, come on.
All right.Get in here. Hurry.
Listen, we gotta get youto that hospital so youcan see your folks.
SANFORD: See, a lot ofkids won't get in a caralone with a stranger,
but when he's gota kid there...
There's a good boy.
Scoot over.Scoot over, San.
SANFORD:...that made it easier.
I want you to hold on tight.
They'd lookat me and say...
We've got a long way to go.
"Hey, if he's safe..."
And we are gonna fly.
"...I guessI will be, too."
Every time they gotin the truck,
I just wanted to die.
As soon as we gotback to the ranch,they went in the coop.

Are you worried thatI'm gonna hurt you?
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Huh? Come here.
BOY: No! No! No!No! Please!I would never hurt you.

He'd... He'dsometimes leave
just one or two of themalive, barely, anyway.
He'd say,
"Finish them, San.
"Finish them or...Finish them orI'll finish you."
And I did.
And I killed them.
And I did.
I killed them.
Oh, God, I killed them!
(SOBBING) Oh, God! Oh!

(BOY CHATTERING)
Mrs. Collins,I'm so sorry.
(CRYING)
Captain, your handling ofthe Christine Collins case
has exposedthis departmentto public ridicule.
There is eventhe possibility of civiland criminal liability.
Sir, nobody could've knownwhat was happeningup at that ranch.
Not us,the sheriff's department,or the marshal's office.
And as for theCollins woman,
I'm still not convincedthat her boy is amongthe victims up in Wineville.
No?
No.
There were four otherphotos of missing boysthat looked a lot like him.
The Clark kidcould've been mistaken.
Maybe he was.
Which begs the obviousquestion. Who cares?
Sir?
The mayor wantsthis to go away.
I want this to go away.
The way you do thatis to stop insistingthat Walter Collins
is not amongthose boys killed upat that goddamn ranch.
Because if the boyyou brought back isnot Walter Collins,
and he's not deadup at that ranch,then where the hell is he?
People are gonnawant to know whywe haven't found him.
Why we're notdoing our job.
But if, on the other hand,
he is, or could be,among those poor boyskilled up in Wineville,
then the inquiries stop.
It's a momentaryembarrassment
you're just gonnahave to live with.
Better a shortinconvenience
than a lingering problem,wouldn't you say, Captain?
Yes, sir.
The boy's been gonenearly a year.
If he was going to be found,it would've happened by now.
Whether he was upat that ranch or not,
the truth is he probablyis dead somewhere.
Better his mother acceptthat now than later,don't you think?
Yes, sir.Good.
That'll be all, Captain.
That's how you want it,then I guess we're done here.
Tell county jail we'reremanding him for trial.
Wait. I didn't do anything.I wasn't even herewhen it happened.
By pretending tobe Walter Collins,
you're interferingin a police investigationof a kidnapping and murder.
We can try you asaccomplice to thatmurder after the fact.
That's too bad.
County jail is a lot worsethan a juvenile hallor a foster home.
It's a lot worse.
You can't do that.I'm just a kid.
Sanford Clark's a kid, too.
Fifteen.He's going to jail.
All murderers and theiraccomplices go to jail.Everybody knows that.
Get him out of here.It's out of my hands now.
Wait. I don'twant to go to jail.
(EXHALES)
Prove it.
I...
I knew Los Angelesis where they makethe Tom Mix movies.
I figuredif I could meet Tom Mix
maybe he would let meride on his horse.
His horse is named Tony.Did you know that?
How are you feeling?
CHRISTINE: All right.
The police stillhave a car outside.
I guess they're waitingto see what your nextmove is going to be.
I'm going home.And then?
Then, I've been giving ita lot of thought.
And what they didto those women, andwhat they did about Walter.
I used to always tell him,"You never start a fight,but you always finish it."
And I didn't startthis fight, butI'm gonna finish it.
Mrs. Collins, right nowyou're a sufficientlyhigh profile that I think
even the police wouldhesitate to go afteryou out in the open,
but I have to warn youthat could changevery quickly
if they feel theirposition threatened.
Very quickly indeed.
What are they gonnado to me now?
They got nothing.
I'm going home.

Hi, sis.
Gordon.
I didn't knowyou were back in town.
Yeah, I got ina couple of days ago,
figured I'd surprise you.Is that... Is that okay?
Yes. Yes, of course.Of course, come on in.
Where's thatlittle niece of mine?
She went into town.
Should be back this evening.
Uh, Bob's here.
Oh, good.
Uh, I was gonna askif I could stay ona couple days.
Staying?
Yeah.
Listen, can I useyour bathroom?
It's been a long rideand I could reallyuse a shower.
Of course.Okay.
Thank you.
Is that...
All right, go next door.I'll call the police. Hurry.
Operator.How may I connect you?
He's upstairs, sir.
Go around the other side!Cut him off!
OFFICER 1: Come with me!OFFICER 2: Yes, sir.
OFFICER 1: Let's go!
Mrs. Collins,I'd like you to meetmy friend, Mr. Hahn.
Mrs. Collins, my deepestcondolences on your loss.
May we come in?
I appreciate the sentiment,
but they've yet to find...
To identify theremains as my son.
I'm afraid it nevergets any easier.
I lost a daughterto polio five years ago.
There's not a day goes bywhen I don't think,
"I should mentionthis to Claudine."
Then I remembershe's not here.
Please, sit.
I've been on the phoneall morning
with the appointmentsecretary of thepolice commission.
They said thatthey won't letme testify
at the hearingor call witnesses.That it won't be necessary.
I know. My sources saythe police commission
is going to say thatJones and the LAPD didabsolutely nothing wrong,
and that the real blame lieswith the kid and with you
for being difficult andforcing them to put youaway for your own safety.
Then I guess I wouldhave to hire a lawyer,file a civil suit.
I went to the bestattorney in town,
a man who'ssued this cityfour times and won.
Unfortunately, we can'tafford to really hire him.
I see.
Which is whyI'm doing this pro bono.
It would bemy honor to defendyour honor, Mrs. Collins.
In my 15 years as a lawyer,
I have never seenanyone fight as longor as hard as you have,
in what is so clearlyin the cause of justice.
Thank you.
NURSE 1: Let me seewhat's on the shelf.
NURSE 2: I'll look.
Yes? May I...
My name is S.S. Hahn,
and I have a court orderfor the immediate releaseof all women being detained
in this institution underthe designation code 12
pending a formal inquiryinto the reasons fortheir detainment.
I'm sorry, the doctorin charge is not here

Either you will producethe people namedin that court order,
or you will findyourself behind bars,and I mean without a key.
I can't authorize you...Madam, stand aside.

No, but I figured it'd bea good idea if I wereto just stay out of it.

No comment.

God damn it!
I thought this wassupposed to go away.
This is an election year.
I can't affordthis kind of press.
It is going away, sir.I've instructed CaptainJones to deal with it.
I'm afraid,falling on his sword
and saying he madea mistake isn't goingto be good enough, Chief.
If we take him outof the picturefor a while,

There's somethingI think you should see.
THORPE:Well, I hate to call a recessbefore we've even started,
but I think a fewphone calls are in order.
The police decidedit'd be best to keepthis off the main docket
in order to avoidexactly the sort of chaoswe have across the street.
Mrs. Collins.I'm Leanne Clay.
This is my husband, John.Hi.
I just wantedto pass alongmy sympathies.

But what the policedid to you, therewas no call for that.
No call at all.

Oh, not guilty, Your Honor.
(PEOPLE WHISPERING)
You may sit, Mr. Northcott.
In light of the defendant'spenchant for internationaltravel, no bail will be set.
This court will hearpreliminary motionsby tomorrow morning.
JONES: The boy,Walter Collins,
was reported as missing,March 10, 1928.
We then instituteda nationwide search.
On August 18th,we received a cableindicating that a boy
matching hisdescription was foundin DeKalb, Illinois.
Upon questioning,he admitted to beingWalter Collins.
We then made arrangementsfor him to be transportedback to California.
Where Mrs. Collins told youthe boy was not her son.
Yes. She deniedhis identity
in spite ofall of the evidencepointing to the contrary.
But, as subsequentevents have demonstrated,
she was correct.
So, what promptedyou to send her
for psychologicalevaluation?
Whether or not this wasin fact the correct boy
was not relevantto my decision.
Throughout this period,she acted strangely.
She was often cooland aloof and unemotional,
especiallywhen confronted withthe boy we found in DeKalb
and in oursubsequent conversation.
It was because of her
disturbing behaviorthat I submitted herfor observation
to the psychopathic wardof Los Angeles CountyGeneral Hospital.
Just like that.
You snap your fingersand an innocent woman
is throwninto the psycho ward!
She wasn't thrown.Every family in this stateis in grave danger
when a police captaincan take a womaninto his office
and five minutes later
have her thrown intothe psychopathic wardon his own authority!
She wasn't thrown.
She wasn't thrown!She wasn't thrown!
What was that, Captain?
She wasn't thrown.She was escorted.
(PEOPLE LAUGHING)
Escorted, thrown, the verbdoesn't matter, Captain.
What does matter isthat her incarceration wasordered without a warrant.
I am holding a carbon copy
of the affidavit of insanitythat was issued in the case
of the State of Californiav. Christine Collins.
Who signed the affidavit?
I did.
Well, now, let me seeif I have this correct,
a woman was throwninto the psychopathicward without a warrant,
because no warrant existed.
And when it was finallywritten several days later,
there was no need to sign itor to go to a judge
because she was alreadyin the asylum!
Is this correct, Captain?
Technically, yes.
Extraordinary steps werenecessary becausewe were dealing...
We were dealing withan extraordinary situation.
Now, is it our faultthat we were being deceived
by a boy who claimed tobe Walter Collins? No.
In light of his claimsand her disturbing behavior,
who wouldn't begin to thinkthat there was somethingthe matter with her?
Because she questioned you?
No, becauseshe wouldn't listen!
Because she insistedon being obstinate!
Because she tried to takematters into her own hand,
best left toqualified officers!
Because oncecivil disobedience starts...
Because she was fightingfor the life of her son!
A boy who may havestill been alive
while you were wastingvaluable time denying youhad done anything wrong!
And in the end
that's whathappened, isn't it?
At some point,while all thiswas going on,
Walter Collinswas brutally murdered,
along with as manyas 19 other boys
at the Northcott Ranchin Wineville.
Is that correct, Captain?
Yes, it is.
MAN: (WHISPERING)It's a travesty.
No further questions.
(PEOPLE APPLAUDING)
MAN ON PA: Train number 14,now boarding on track...
So, after much effort,we were ableto identify this boy,
who's been responsiblefor so much trouble lately,
as Arthur Hutchinsof Cedar Rapids, lowa.
Between this,and the arrest of the mansuspected of murdering
the real Walter Collins,
we've cleared uptwo of the biggest mysteriesin the history of Los Angeles.
I hope you gentlemenof the press will give
as much space to thegood things we do
as the mistakesthat are madeon rare occasions.
Gentlemen, allow meto introduce you
to the boy's real mother,Mrs. Janet Hutchins.
Arthur.
I hope he wasn't toomuch trouble for you.
Oh, no, not at all.

Mrs. Hutchins,
Mrs. Collins, the womanhe was staying with,wanted him to have these.
They're the clothesshe let him wear.
Well, thank you.
Isn't that nice, Arthur?
Tell the nice officer,"Thank you."
I don't want them.Give them to somebody else.
(CHUCKLING) Precociouslittle fellow, isn't he?
It's not my fault.It's the police.
They said I wasWalter Collins, not me!It wasn't my idea!
Not my idea!Get...
Yeah. Go blame the policefor your own mistakes.
We've seen a lotof that lately,haven't we?
Take care now, Arthur!Safe travels.
All right, fellas,that's it for today.
REPORTER: Sir, sir!What did the boymean by that?
It was March 10th,and I came homefrom work,
and my nine-year-oldson, Walter, was gone.
Captain Jones was actingon information he believedto be correct.
Walter Collins hada diastema, alsoknown as a diastema.
That child was neverin my classroom.
I can certainlyattest to that.
STEELE: We rely onour good friends inthe police department
to point to usthose people whoexhibit behavior
which is sociallyunacceptable.
CHRISTINE: About fourinches shorter than thelast mark of Walter.
Well, some ofthese pictures show
what Sanford Clarktold me,
that he did in facthelp in the murderof these children.
PROSECUTOR:Thank you, Detective.
Gentlemen of the jury,
I ask you to takea good look atthese images.
They establish beyondany reasonable doubt
the circumstances andthe nature of theseheinous crimes.
I'm in here,Reverend.
When Walter washere, I used towalk by his room
when he was sleeping.
And even thoughI couldn't seehim or hear him,
I could feel him.
That's why I don'tthink Walter's dead.
I can still feel him.
Mrs. Collins...No.
I know whatthe police said.
But that placeand the remains,
they couldn't beproperly identified.
And maybe that kidmade a mistake when hepicked Walter's picture.
I understand you don'twant to accept this.
What mother would?
But I think it's timefor you to move on
and start overfor yourself.
Your son wouldwant you to move on.
Maybe.
Maybe he'd want meto keep looking for him.
Maybe he's somewherewaiting for me.
I believe he iswaiting, ma'am.
He's waiting inthat place where
we'll all go somedayto be reunited withour loved ones.
And on that day, he'llknow from front to back,end to end,

Why?

He says he lied whenhe testified that hedidn't kill Walter.
Christine, he's willingto finally admit thathe did it.
He says if youcome up to seehim in person,
then he'll tell youthe truth, to your face

It's one thing,Mrs. Collins,to send a telegram,
that is really easy.
But when it's here,right now, in person,you know,
I just, I can't...
I can't tell youwhat you want tohear, Mrs. Collins.
And why not?
Because I don't wantto go to hell witha lie on my lips.
See, I did my penance,
and I asked God toforgive me and he did,so far as I know.
And I have beenreally good ever since.

SANFORD: They'renot in there!Come on! Get in the car!
I'm gonna find you!Damn it! Damn it!Come on.
Shit! Get inthe car, Sanford!
(PANTING)
That was the lastI saw of any of them.
So, you don't knowif either of the othertwo were captured?
No.
All I know is,
if Walter hadn'tcome back for me
I don't think I everwould've gotten outof there.
Okay.
So, what happenedafter that?
I kept offthe main roads,
until I saw a trainstopped at a crossingand I jumped in.
Why didn't you tellanyone what had happened?
I was afraid.
I thought they'd comeafter me, or my folks.
So, I just didn'ttell anybody.
I was on my own untilI got a free meal fromthis lady, Miss Lansing.
Told her I was anorphan, on my own.
She said I could stay on.
And I did.
Every night,
I'd wake up thinkingthey were rightoutside my window.
And then I heardthe police talkingon the radio
about what happenedat the ranch.
And I thought,"For sure I can'tgo back now."
(SOFTLY) Why?
Why not?
Since I didn't tellanybody what happened.
I was afraid they'dblame me for thosekids being dead.
(SNIFFLES)
So I just stayed away.
What made you comeforward now, afterall this time?
Hmm? Why comeforward now?
I really miss my mom.
I really miss my dad.
I just wanna go home.
(DAVID SOBBING)
I just wanna go home.
(DOOR OPENING)
(MRS. CLAY SOBBING)
(CRYING) Are you all right?
I love you.
I still can't believe it.
Five years, case closed,everyone thinks he's dead,and there he is.
Wouldn't be, if itwasn't for Walter.
Your son dida brave thing,Mrs. Collins.
You should bevery proud of him.
I am.
You still thinkhe's out there?
Why not?
Three boys madea run for it thatnight, Detective.
And if one got out,
then maybe eitheror both of theothers did, too.
Maybe Walter's out there,having the same fearsthat he did.
Afraid to come homeand identify himself,
or afraid he'll getinto trouble.
But either way,
it gives me somethingI didn't have beforetonight.
What's that?
Hope.
