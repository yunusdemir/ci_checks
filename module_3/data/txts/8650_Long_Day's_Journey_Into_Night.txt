Thank heaven the fog is gone.
I...
I do feel...
Out of sorts this morning.
I wasn't able to get
much sleep...
With that awful foghorn going on
all night long.
Yes, like having a sick
whale in the backyard.
Kept me awake too.
Did it?
You have a strange way
of showing your restlessness.
You were snoring so hard I couldn't
tell which was the foghorn.
Ten foghorns couldn't disturb you.
You haven't a nerve in you.
You never had.
Nonsense. You always
exaggerate about my snoring.
I couldn't.
If you could
only hear yourself once.
What's the Joke, I wonder.
It's on me I'll bet that much.
It's always on the old man.
Yes. It's terrible the way
we all pick on you isn't it?
You're so abused!
Never mind.
No matter what the joke is, it's
a relief to hear Edmund laugh.
He's been so down in the mouth lately.
Some joke of Jamie's, I'll wager.
He's forever making sneering fun
of somebody, that one.
Now!
Don't start in on poor Jamie dear...
He'll turn out alright in the end.
You wait and see.
He better start soon then, he's nearly 34.
Good heavens!
Are they gonna stay in the
dinning room all day?
Jamie! Edmund!
Come out on the porch, give Cathleen
a chance to clear the table.
You'd make excuses for him
no matter what he did.
I've been teasing your
father about his snoring.
I'll... I'll leave it to the boys
James, they must've heard you.
Though not you Jamie I could hear
you down the hall...
Almost as bad as your father,
you're like him.
As soon as your head
touches the pillow you're off.
And ten foghorns couldn't wake you.
Why are you staring Jamie?
Is my hair coming down? Or...
Something?
It's hard for me to
do it out properly now.
My eyes are getting so bad
and I can never find my glasses
No. Your hair's alright Mama I was
just thinking how well you look.
Just as I was telling her Jamie.
She's so fat and sassy
there will soon be no holding her.
Yes, you certainly look grand Mama.
And I'll back you up about Papa's snoring.
Gosh! What a racket!
Oh, I heard him too,
"The Moor, I know his trumpet."
If it takes my snoring to make
you remember Shakespeare...
Instead of the dope sheet on the ponies,
I hope I’ll keep on with it.
James! You mustn’t be so touchy.
Yes, for Pete’s sake, Papa!
The first thing after breakfast!
Give it a rest, can’t you?
Your father wasn’t finding fault with you.
You don’t have to always
take Jamie’s part.
- You’d think you were the one ten years older...
- Let's forget it!
That's right! Forget everything
and face nothing.
It's a convenient philosophy in life
if you've no other ambitions...
James! Be quiet.
What were you two grinning about
like Cheshire cats when you came out?
What was the joke?
Yes, let us in on it, lad.
You remember, Papa,
the ice pond...
On Harker’s estate is right
next to the farm,
and you remember Shaughnessy keeps pigs.
Well, it seems there’s
a break in the fence...
And the pigs have been bathing
in the millionaire’s ice pond.
Well! Good heavens!
The poor pigs, Shaughnessy yelled,
had caught their death of cold.
Many of them were
dying of pneumonia...
And several others had been
taken down with...
Cholera from drinking
the poisoned water.
He told Harker he was hiring a
lawyer to sue him for damages.
And then he wound up by saying...
He had to put up
with potato bugs...
And ticks and poison ivy and snakes
and skunks on his farm...
But he was an honest man who
had to draw the line somewhere...
And he’d be damned if he’d stand
for a Standard Oil thief trespassing.
So would Harker kindly remove his
dirty feet from the premises...
Before he sicked the dog on him.
And Harker did!
Heavens! What a terrible
tongue that man has.
The damned old scoundrel.
By God you can't beat him.
The dirty blaggard, he'll get
me into serious trouble yet.
I hope you told him
I'd be mad as hell!
I told him you'd be tickled to death
over the great irish victory...
And so you are, stop faking Papa.
Well I'm not tickled to death.
You are too James,
you're simply denying it.
Oh, what are you laughing at?
There's nothing funny!
A fine son you are to help that
blaggard get me into a lawsuit.
Now James!
Don't lose your temper!
Yes, I suppose you're regretting...
You weren't there
to prompt Shaughnessy...
With a few nastier insults.
You've a fine talent for that
if for nothing else.
James! There's no reason to scold Jamie!
For God's sake Papa!
If you're gonna start
that stuff, I'll beat it.
God Papa. I should think you'd
get sick of hearing yourself.
You mustn't mind Edmund, James.
Remember he isn't well.
A summer cold makes anyone irritable.
It's not just a cold he's got.
The kid is damn sick.
Why do you say that?
It is just a cold, anyone can tell that.
You always imagine things.
All Jamie meant was is he may have
a touch of something else...
Which makes his cold worse.
Sure Mama that's all I meant.
Dr. Hardy thinks it might be
a bit of malarial fever...
He caught when he was
in the tropics.
Dr. Hardy!
I wouldn't believe a thing he said
if he swore it on a stack of bibles.
I know what doctors are...
They're all alike, anything...
They don't care what to keep you
coming to them.
What is it?
What...? What are you looking at?
Is my hair coming down?
Or... Something?
There's nothing wrong
with your hair.
The fatter and healthier you get,
the vainer you became.
You'll soon spend half the day
primping before the mirror.
My eyes are so bad now.
I really should have new glasses.
Your eyes are beautiful...
And well you know it.
James you mustn't be so silly.
And right in front of Jamie.
He's onto you now too.
He knows all this talk about eyes and hair
is only fishing for compliments.
He, Jamie?
- Yes you can't kid us Mama.
- Get along with, both of you.
But I... I did truly have...
Have beautiful hair once.
Didn't I James?
Most beautiful in the world
It.. it was a rare shade of...
of reddish brown...
And so long it came down below my knees
You ought to remember it too, Jamie.
It wasn't until after Edmund was born
that I had a single grey hair.
And that made it prettier than ever.
Will you listen to your father Jamie.
After 35 years of marriage...
He isn't a great actor for nothing, is he?
What's come over you James?
Are you pouring coals
of fire on my head...
For teasing you about
your snoring?
Well then I take it all back. It
must've been ONLY the foghorn I heard.
Well...
I can't stay here any longer,
even to hear compliments.
I have to see the cook about
dinner and the day's marketing.
That Bridget is...
So lazy and so sly she begins
Telling me about her relatives...
So I can't get a word
in edgeways to scold her.
Well...
I may as well get it over with.
Don't make Edmund work on the
grounds with you James, remember?
Not that he isn't strong enough
but he'd perspire...
And he might catch more cold.
You're a fine lunkhead!
Haven't you any sense?
Don't you know the one thing
to avoid is saying anything...
That would get her
more upset over Edmund?
All right. Have it your way.
I still think it’s the wrong idea
to let Mama go on kidding herself.
It will only make the shock
worse when she has to face it.
Anyway, you can see she’s deliberately...
Fooling herself with that
summer cold talk.
She knows better.
- Knows? Nobody knows yet.
- Well, I do.
I was with Edmund when he went
to see Doc Hardy on Monday.
I heard him pull that touch
of malaria stuff. He was stalling.
That isn’t what he thinks any more.
You know it as well as I do.
You talked to him when you went
uptown yesterday, didn’t you?
He can't say anything for sure yet.
He’s to phone me today
before Edmund goes to him.
He thinks it’s consumption,
doesn’t he, Papa?
He said it might be.
That poor kid!
God damn it!
It might never have happened...
If you’d sent him to a real doctor
when he first got sick.
What’s the matter with Hardy? He’s
always been our doctor up here.
Hardy only charges a dollar.
That’s what makes you think
he’s a fine doctor!
If you mean I can’t afford
one of the fine society doctors...
Who prey on the rich summer people...
Can’t afford? You’re one of the biggest
property owners around here.
That doesn’t mean I’m rich.
If Edmund was a lousy acre
of land you wanted...
The sky would be the limit.
That's a lie!
And your sneers against
Dr. Hardy are lies too.
I recon I'm a fool to argue.
You can't change the leopard's spots.
No you can't!
You've taught me that lesson
only too well...
I've lost all hope you'll
ever change yours.
You dare tell me what I can afford!
You've never known the value of a dollar
in your life and you never will.
At the end of each season
you're penniless.
You've thrown your salary away
every week on whores and whiskey.
My salary!? God!
More than you're worth.
You couldn't get that
if it wasn't for me.
If you weren't my son,
there's not a manager...
In the business that
would give you a part.
Your reputation stinks you.
As it is, I have to humble my pride
and beg for you
Say you've turned over a new leaf
although I know it's a lie.
I never wanted to be an actor.
You forced me on the stage.
That's a lie!
You left it to me
to get you a job...
And I've no influence
except in the theater.
Forced you?!
You never wanted to do anything
except loaf in bar rooms.
After all the money I wasted
on your education...
And all you did was get fired and disgraced
from every college you went.
Well for God's sake don't
drag up that ancient history!
It's not ancient history that
you have to come back...
Every summer to live on me.
Well I earn my board and lodging
working on the grounds.
It saves you hiring a man.
You have to be driven even to do that much.
I wouldn’t give a damn
if you ever displayed...
The slightest sign of gratitude.
The only thanks is to have you sneer
at me for a dirty miser...
Sneer at my profession...
Sneer at every damned thing in the world,
except yourself.
That’s not true, Papa. You can’t hear
me talking to myself, that’s all.
“Ingratitude, the vilest weed that grows”!
God! I could see that line coming!
God, how many thousand times...
All right, Papa.
I’m a bum.
You’re young yet. You could
still make your mark.
You had the talent to
become a fine actor!
You have it still.
You’re my son!
Oh, let’s forget me.
I’m not interested in the subject...
And neither are you.
What started us on this?
Doc Hardy!
When is he going to call
you up about Edmund?
Around lunch time.
The less you say about
Edmund’s sickness...
The better for your conscience!
You’re more responsible than anyone!
That’s a lie!
I won’t stand for that, Papa!
It’s the truth!
He grew up admiring you as a hero!
If you ever gave him advice except
in the ways of rottenness...
I’ve never heard of it!
You made him old before his time...
Pumping him full
of what you consider...
Worldly wisdom, when he was
too young to see...
That your mind was so poisoned
by your own failure in life...
You wanted to believe...
Every man was a knave
with his soul for sale...
And every woman who
wasn’t a whore was a fool!
All right. All right. I did
put him wise to a few things,
But not until after I'd seen
he’d started to raise hell...
And would only laugh at me
if I pulled that good advice...
Older brother stuff.
All I did was make a pal of him
and be absolutely frank...
So he’d learn from my mistakes that...
Well, that if you can’t be good
you can at least be careful.
That’s a rotten accusation, Papa.
You know how much
that kid means to me...
And how close we’ve always been...
Not like the usual brothers.
I’d do anything for him.
I know you may have thought
it was for the best.
I didn’t say you did it
deliberately to harm him.
Besides it’s damned rot!
I’d like to see anyone
influence Edmund...
Any more than
he wants to be.
What had I to do
with all the crazy stunts...
He’s pulled in the last
few years...
Working his way all over the map
as a sailor and all that stuff.
No, thanks!
I’ll stick to Broadway, and
a room with a bath...
And bars that serve
bonded Bourbon.
You and Broadway!
It’s made you what you are!
Whatever Edmund’s done, he’s had
the guts to go off on his own...
Where he couldn’t come whining
to me the minute he was broke.
He’s always come home broke
finally, hasn’t he?
And what's his going away get him?
Look at him now!
God! That’s a lousy thing to say.
I didn’t mean that.
He’s been doing well on the paper.
You used to talk about becoming
a newspaper man...
But you were never willing to start
at the bottom, you expected...
Oh for God's sake Papa!
Can't you lay off me?
Damnable luck Edmund
should be sick right now...
It couldn't have come
at a worse time for him.
Or for your mother.
It's damnable she should have
this to upset her...
Just when she needs peace
and freedom from worry.
She's been so well in the two
months since she came home.
It's been heaven to me.
This home's been a real home again.
- But I needn't tell you Jamie.
- No. I felt the same way Papa.
Yes. She's been a different woman
entirely from the other times.
She's control of her nerves,
or she had until Edmund got sick.
Now you can feel her growing tense
and frightened underneath.
I wish to God we could keep
the truth from her...
But we can't if he's to be sent
to a sanatorium.
What makes it worse is her father
died of consumption.
She worshiped him.
She's never forgotten him.
Yes it'll be hard for her.
But she can do it!
She's the willpower now.
We must help her Jamie.
In every way we can.
Of course Papa.
Outside of nerves she seemed
perfectly alright this morning.
Yes, never better, she's full
of fun and mischief.
Why do you say 'seems'?
Why shouldn't she be alright?
What the hell do you mean?
Don't start jumping down my throat.
God! Papa.
This ought to be one thing we can
talk over frankly, without a battle.
I'm sorry Jamie.
But go on and tell me.
There's nothing to tell.
I was all wrong.
It's just that...
last night...
Well you know how it is Papa.
I can't forget the past.
I can't help being suspicious
anymore than you can.
That's the hell of it.
And it makes it hell for Mama.
- She watches us watching her.
- I know.
Well what was it?
Can't you speak up?
Around 3 o'clock this morning,
I woke up...
And I heard Mama moving around
in the spare room.
Then she went to the bathroom.
Now, I pretended to be asleep...
And she stopped outside
in the hall to listen...
As if she wanted to make sure I was.
For God's sake! Is that all?
She told me herself the foghorn
kept her awake all last night...
And every night
since Edmund's been sick...
She's been up and down going
to his room to see how he was.
Yes, that's right. She did stop
to listen outside his room.
But it was her being in the
spare room that scared me.
Papa...
I can't help remembering that
when she starts sleeping alone in there...
It's always been a sign.
But it isn't this time.
It's easily explained.
Where else could she go last night
to get away from my snoring?
How you can live with a mind
that sees nothing but...
The worse motives behind
everything is beyond me.
Don't pull that! I just
said I was all wrong.
I suppose I'm as glad
of that as you are.
Yes. Yes. I'm
sure you are Jamie.
It's been like a curse she can't
escape if worry over Edmund.
It was her long sickness after bringing
him into the world that she first...
She didn't have
anything to do with it.
I'm not blaming her.
Well who are you blaming?
Edmund? For being born?
You damn fool, no one
was to blame.
That bastard of a doctor was.
From what Mama said he was
another cheap quack like Hardy.
You wouldn't pay for
a first class doctor.
You liar!
So I'm to blame, am I?
That's what you're driving at.
You evil minded loafer.
What were you two
arguing about?
Same old stuff.
I heard you saying something
about a doctor.
And your father accusing you
of being evil minded.
Oh, that? Well I was just
saying again that Doc. Hardy...
Isn't my idea of
the world's greatest physician.
No. No. I wouldn't say
he was either.
That Bridget!
I... I thought I'd never get away.
She told me all about her second cousin
on the police force in St. Louis.
Well if you're going to work on
the hedge, why don't you go?
I... I mean...
Take advantage of the sunshine
before the fog comes back.
Because I... I know it will.
That is... The rheumatism
in my hands knows it.
It's a better weather
prophet than you are James.
How ugly they are.
Who would ever believe
they were once beautiful.
Now now Mary...
None of that foolishness.
They're the sweetest
hands in the world.
Come on Jamie!
The way to start work
is to start work.
The hot sun will sweat some of that
booze fat off your middle.
We're all so proud of you
Mama, so darn happy!
But you've still
got to be careful.
I mean you mustn't worry
so much about Edmund.
He'll be all right.
Of course he'll be all right
And I.. I don't
know what you mean.
Warning me to be careful...
All right Mama. I'm sorry I spoke.
Here you are!
I was just going
upstairs to look for you.
I didn't want to mix up
in any arguments.
I feel too rotten.
I'm sure you don't feel half
as badly as you make out...
You're such a baby.
You like to get us worried
so we'll make a fuss over you...
No, no. I'm only teasing you dear,
I know how...
Miserably uncomfortable you must be.
But you feel better today, don't you?
All the same you...
you've grown much too thin.
Come on, sit down.
All you need is your mother
to nurse you.
Big as you are, you're still the baby
of the family to me you know?
Never mind me,
you take care of yourself.
That's all that counts.
But I am.
Heavens... Don't you see
how fat I've grown?
I'll have to have all my dresses let out.
They started clipping the hedge.
Poor Jamie!
How he hates working in front
where everyone passing can see him.
Not that I want anything
to do with them.
I've always hated this place
and everyone in it.
But your father liked it
And insisted on building
this house and...
I've had to come here every summer.
It was wrong from the start.
Everything was done
in the cheapest possible way.
Your father would never spend
the money to make it right.
It's just as well we
haven't any friends.
I'd be ashamed to have
them step in the door.
But...
Yo... Your father has
never wanted family friends.
All he likes is to hobnob with men...
In bar-rooms or at the club.
You and Jamie are the same way.
But you're not to blame.
I know it's useless to talk but...
Sometimes I...
I feel so lonely.
You've got to be fair Mama.
It may have been all his fault
in the beginning...
But you know that latter on,
even if he'd wanted to...
We couldn't have had people here.
Don't I... I can't bear
having you remind...
Don't take it that way please Mama,
I'm trying to help.
Because it's bad for you to forget.
The right way is to remember,
then you'll always be on your guard.
I... I don't understand...
Why you should suddenly say such things.
What put it in your mind this morning?
Nothing, it just... Well I... because
I feel rotten and blue I suppose.
Tell me the truth.
Why are you so... Suspicious
all of a sudden?
I'm not.
Yes you are, I feel it.
Your father and Jamie
too, particularly...
Now don't start
imagining things Mama.
It makes it so much harder...
Living in this atmosphere
of constant suspicion...
Knowing that everyone
is spying on me...
That none of you believe
in me or trust me.
- That's crazy Mama. We do trust you.
- If there only...
Some place I could go
to get away for a day...
Or even an afternoon...
Some woman friend
I could talk to.
Not about anything serious, simply laugh
and gossip and forget for a while.
Someone besides the servants...
That stupid Cathleen.
Stop it Mama, you're getting yourself
worked up over nothing.
Your father goes out, he meets his friends
in bar-rooms or at the club.
You and Jamie have the boys,
you know, you go out.
But I'm alone,
I've always been alone.
Come on now,
you know that's a fib.
One of us always stays around
to keep you company.
Because you're afraid
to trust me alone.
I insist you tell me why you...
Act so differently this morning.
Why you felt you had to remind me.
It's stupid...
It's just because I wasn't asleep when
you came into my room last night.
You didn't go back to your
and Papa's room...
You went into the spare room
for the rest of the night.
Because your father's snoring
was driving me crazy...
For heavens sake!
Haven't I often used the
spare room as my bedroom?
But I... I...
I see what you thought, that was..
- I didn't think...
- Well I...
So...
You were...
You were pretending
to be asleep...
In order to spy on me.
No, I did it because I knew
if you found out I was...
Feverish and couldn't sleep,
it would upset you.
Jamie was pretending
to be asleep too...
I'm sure, and I suppose
your father...
- Stop it Mama!
- Oh Edmund!
I can't bear it when even you...
It would serve all of you
right if it was true.
Mama don't say that!
- That's the way you...
- Stop suspecting me!
Please dear.
You hurt me.
I couldn't sleep because...
I was thinking about you.
Th-that's the real reason.
I've been so worried
ever since you got sick.
That's foolishness.
You know it's just a bad cold.
Yes. Yes, of course,
I know that.
But listen, Mama.
I want you to promise me...
That e-even if it should turn out
to be something worse.
- You know I'll soon be all right again anyway.
- No! No!
And you won't worry
yourself sick about it...
And you'll keep on
taking care of yourself.
No! No! I won't listen
when you're so silly.
There's absolutely
no reason to talk...
As if you expected
something dreadful.
Of course I promise you.
I give you my sacred word of honor.
But I suppose you're remembering...
I've promised before.
I've no word of honor
No.
I'm not blaming you dear.
How can you help it?
How can any of us forget?
That's what makes it so...
Hard for all of us.
We can't... Forget.
Stop it Mama!
Alright dear.
I didn't mean to be so gloomy.
Don't mind me.
Here, let me feel your head.
Well!
It's nice and cool!
You certainly haven't any fever now.
Forget me, it's you.
But I'm...
I'm quite alright dear, except...
I... I naturally feel...
Tired and nervous this morning
after such a bad night.
I... I really...
Ought to go upstairs...
And lie down...
Until lunch time... And take a nap.
What are you gonna do?
Read?
Here?
It'd be much better
for you if you...
Went out in the...
fresh air, sunshine.
Don't get overheated remember...
Be sure and wear a hat.
Or are you afraid to trust me alone?
Can't you stop talking like that?
I think you ought to take a nap.
I'll go out and help Jamie bear up.
I'd love to lie in the shade
and watch him work.
It'll be lunch time soon...
Will I call your father
and Mr. Jamie or will you?
You do it.
Oh and you'd better call
my mother too.
What for? She's always
on time without any calling.
God bless her, she has some
consideration for the help.
She's taking a nap.
She wasn't asleep when I finished
my work upstairs a while back.
She was lying down in the spare room
with her eyes wide open.
She had a terrible headache, she said.
Oh well then... Just call my father.
No wonder my feet kill me each night.
Mr Tyrone!
Mr. Jamie!
It's time!
Sneaking one, ah?
Cut out the bluff kid,
you're a rottener actor than I am.
Grabbing while the going was good.
Why don't you sneak one
while you got a chance?
Yeah I was thinking
of that little thing.
Hey! The old man was out there
talking to old Captain Turner.
Yup, he's still at it.
You don't think
that'll fool him do ya?
Well... Maybe not...
But he can't prove it.
God! I hope he doesn't forget lunch...
Listening to himself talk.
I'm hungry.
That's what I hate working out
down at the front.
He puts on an act for every
damn fool that comes along.
You're in luck to be hungry.
The way I feel I don't care
if I ever eat again.
Look kid...
You know I never lectured you...
But Doc. Hardy was right when he told you
to cut out the red eye.
Well I'm going to after the...
After he hands me the
bad news this afternoon...
A few before then
won't make any difference.
Jamie...
What do you think it is?
How the hell would I know?
I'm no doc.
Where's Mama?
Upstairs.
When did she go up?
Oh about the time you started
working on the hedge I guess.
She said she was going to take a nap.
You didn't tell me.
Why should I? What about it?
She was tired out, she didn't get
much sleep last night.
Yeah I know she didn't.
Damn foghorn kept me awake too.
She's...
Been upstairs alone...
All morning uh?
You haven't seen her?
No, I was reading.
I wanted to give her
a chance to sleep.
Is she coming down to lunch?
Of course.
No!
No "Of course" about it.
She might not want any lunch...
Or she might start having
her meals alone upstairs.
- Cut out... Can't you think of...
- Well it's happened hasn't it?
You're all wrong to suspect anything.
Cathleen saw her not long ago.
Mama didn't tell her she
wouldn't be down for lunch.
Then she wasn't taking a nap.
No, not right then but, she was
lying down, Cathleen said.
- In the spare room?
- Yes! For Pete’s sake what of it?
You damn fool!
Why did you leave
her alone so long?
Why didn't you stick around?
Because she accused me
and you and Papa...
Of spying on her all the time
and not trusting her.
She made me feel ashamed.
I know how rotten it must be for her.
And she promised on her
sacred word of honor.
You ought to know
that doesn't mean...
- It does this time.
- That's what we though the other times.
Oh, look kid I know you think
I'm a cynical bastard...
But remember I've seen more
of this game than you have.
You never knew what was really wrong
until you were in prep school.
Papa and I kept it from you.
I was wise ten years or more
before we had to tell you.
I know this game backwards...
And I've been thinking all morning
of the way she acted last night...
When she thought we were asleep.
I haven't been able to think
of anything else...
And now you tell me she got you to leave
her alone upstairs all morning.
Alright kid.
Don't start a battle with me.
I hope as much as you do I'm crazy.
You know I've been
happy as hell...
Because I'd really begun
to believe that this time...
She's coming downstairs,
you win on that one...
I guess I was a damn suspicious louse.
Damn it I wish I'd grabbed
another drink
You mustn't cough like that,
it's bad for your throat.
You don't want to get a sore throat
on top of your cold do you?
But I seem always to be picking on you
telling you "don't do this"...
"Don't do that".
Forgive me dear, it's just that
I want to take care of you.
Oh I know that.
What about you, do you feel rested?
Ever so much better.
I've been lying down
ever since you went out...
It's what I needed after such
a restless night,
I don't feel nervous now.
That's fine.
Good heavens how down in the mouth
you look you look Jamie.
What's the matter now?
Nothing.
I'd forgotten...
You've been working on the front hedge!
That always account for your
sinking into the dumps, doesn't it?
If you wanna think so Mama.
Well that's the effect
it always has isn't it?
What a big baby you are!
Isn't he Edmund?
He's certainly a fool to care
what anyone thinks.
Yes!
The only way is to make yourself not care.
Where's your father?
I heard Cathleen call him.
She's down there now, interrupting
the famous beautiful voice.
She should have more respect.
It's you who should have more respect.
You...
Who thanks to him have never
had to work hard in your life.
Remember, your...
Father is getting old Jamie.
You really...
Ought to show more consideration.
I'm hungry. I wish that old
man would get a move on.
It's a rotten trick the way
he keeps meals waiting...
And then beefs because they're spoiled.
Very trying Jamie.
You don't know how trying.
You don’t have to keep house
with summer servants.
Who don't care because...
Because they know it isn't
a permanent position.
Your father won't even pay the wages
the best summer help ask.
So every year...
I have stupid
lazy greenhorns to deal with.
But you've heard me say
this a thousand times.
What makes you ramble
on like that Mama?
I don't know...
Nothing in particular dear.
It's foolish of me.
Lunch is ready ma'am.
I went down to Mr. Tyrone
like you ordered...
And he said he'd come
right away but...
Alright Cathleen.
Tell Bridget I'm sorry...
But she'll have to wait a few minutes
until Mr. Tyrone is here.
Yes ma'am.
Look damn it!
Why don't we go in without him?
He's told us to.
He doesn't mean it.
Don't you know your father yet?
He'd be so terribly hurt.
I'll...
I'll go make him get a move on.
Why do you stare... Like that?
You know.
I don't know.
Oh, for God's sake Mama,
You think you can fool me?
I'm not blind.
I don't know what you're talking about.
No?
Take a look at your eyes in the mirror.
I got Papa moving...
He'll...
He'll be here any minute.
What's the matter.
- Your brother...
- What happened Mama?
Your brother ought to be ashamed
of himself, he's been insinuating...
I don't know what.
God... Damn you!
Stop it at once!
Do it!
He's a liar!
It's a lie, isn't it Mama?
What's a lie?
Edmund... Don't.
There comes your father up the
steps, I must... Warn Bridget.
Well?
Well...
What?
You're a liar.
Sorry I'm late!
Captain Turner stopped to talk...
Once he starts gabbing you
can't get away from him.
You mean once he starts listening.
It's all right, the level
in the bottle hasn't changed.
I wasn't noticing that.
As if it proved anything with you about.
I'm on to your tricks.
Did I hear you say "let's
all have a drink"?
Jamie's welcome after his
hard morning's work...
But I won't invite you.
Doctor Harding...
To hell with Doc. Hardy!
One isn't going to kill me.
I feel all in Papa.
Well come along then,
it's before a meal.
I've always found that good whiskey,
taken in moderation...
As an appetizer,
is the best of tonics.
I said "in moderation".
It'd be a waste of breath
mentioning moderation to you.
Well...
Here's to health and happiness.
That's a joke!
What is?
Nothing. Here's to health.
Well what's the matter here?
There's gloom in the air
you could cut with a knife.
You got the drink you
were after didn't you?
Why are you wearing that
gloomy look on your mug?
You won't be singing
a song yourself soon.
Shut up Jamie!
I thought lunch was ready.
I'm hungry as a hunter.
Where's your mother?
Here I am!
I've had to calm down Bridget.
She's in a tantrum over you being
late again and I don't blame her.
If your lunch is dried up
from waiting in the oven...
She said you could like it
or leave it, for all she cared.
Oh, I'm so sick and tired
of pretending this is a home!
You won't help me.
You won't put yourself out the least bit
You don't know how to act in a home,
you don't even want one...
You've never have wanted one
since we were married.
You should have remained a bachelor
and lived in second rate hotels.
Entertained your friends
in bar-rooms...
And nothing ever
would've happened...
Mama!
Stop talking.
Why don't we go in to lunch?
Yes... Yes.
It is inconsiderate of me to...
Dig up the past when I...
Know your father and Jamie
must be hungry.
I do hope you have an appetite dear.
You really must eat more...
Why is that glass there?
Did you have a drink?
Oh, how can you be such a fool?
You're to blame James!
How could you let him?
Do you want to kill him?
Don't you remember my father?
He wouldn't stop after he was stricken.
He said doctors were fools...
He thought like you
that whiskey is a good tonic...
But of course...
There... There...
There's no comparison...
At all, is there?
I... I don't know why I... I...
Forgive me for...
Scolding you James.
One... One small drink
won't hurt Edmund.
Might be good for him.
If it gives him an appetite.
For God's sake let's eat.
Come on kid,
let's put on the feed bag.
Yes.
You go in with your mother lads.
I'll join you in a second.
Why... Why do you...
Look at me like that?
Please stop staring James...
One would think you're accusing me.
James...
You don't... Understand...
I understand that I've been a
god damned fool to believe in you.
I don't know what you mean by
"believing" in me, all I felt was...
Distrust and spying...
And suspicion.
Why are you having another drink?
You never have more
than one drink before lunch.
Well...
I know what to expect,
you'll be drunk tonight
And it won't be the first time, will it?
Or the thousandth.
James...
Please... Please...
You don't understand...
I've been so worried...
So worried about Edmund.
I'm so afraid.
I don't want to listen
to your excuses Mary.
Excuses?
You...
You mean...
You couldn't believe that of me.
You mustn't believe that James. No.
Shall...
Shall we not go in to lunch...
Dear?
I don't want anything but I know
you must be hungry.
James...
I tried...
So hard.
I tried...
So hard!
Please...
Believe me.
Yes I suppose you did Mary.
But for the love of God...
Why couldn't you have
the strength to keep on?
I... I don't know what
you're talking about.
Have the strength to...
Keep on what?
Never mind.
It's no use now.
It's unreasonable to expect Bridget
and Cathleen to act as...
If this were home, they know
it isn't as well as we know it.
Never has been and never will be.
No it never can be now,
but it was once...
Before you...
Before I what?
No...
No dear, whatever
you say, it isn't true.
It was never a home.
You've always preferred
a club or a bar-room.
And for me it's...
Always been as lonely as a dirty room
in a one night stand hotel.
I'm...
I'm worried about you... Edmund.
Edmund. You...
You hardly touched anything.
It's alright for me not to
have an appetite, I've...
I've been growing too fat but...
You must eat.
Pro... Promise me you
will dear, for my sake.
Yes Mama.
That's a good boy.
I'll answer.
Maguire said he'd call.
Hello.
How are you doctor?
I see...
Well...
You'll explain all about it
when you see him this afternoon.
Yes he'll be with you
without fail at 4 o'clock.
Yes.
Yes.
Goodbye.
Goodbye doctor.
Well that didn't sound
like glad tidings.
It was doctor Hardy.
He wants to... You to be sure
to see him at 4 this afternoon.
What did he say?
Not that I give a damn.
I wouldn't believe him if he
swore on a stack of bibles.
Don't pay attention to a word
he says Edmund.
Mary!
Oh, we all know why you like
him James, because he's cheap.
Please don't try to tell me, I know
all about the Doctor Hardy.
Heaven knows I ought to
after all these years.
He's an ignorant fool.
Should be a law to keep man
like him from practicing.
He hasn't the slightest idea...
When you're in agony
and half insane, he...
Sits and holds your hand and delivers
sermons on willpower.
He deliberately humiliates you.
He makes you beg and plead.
He treats you like a criminal.
He understands nothing!
And yet it was exactly the
same type of cheap quack...
Who first gave you
the medicine...
And you never knew what it was
until it was too late.
I hate doctors!
For Christ sake Mama!
Stop talking.
Yes Mary, it's no time to...
You're... You're...
Quite right dear, forgive me, I...
I...
It's useless to be angry now.
I'm going upstairs... For a moment.
If you'll excuse me.
I have to fix my hair.
That is, if I can... Find my glasses.
- I'll be right down.
- Mary.
Yes dear!
What is it?
Nothing.
You're welcome to come up
and watch me if you're so suspicious.
As if that could do any good,
you'd only postpone it.
I'm not your jailor.
This isn't a prison.
No,
I know you can't help
thinking it's a home.
I'm sorry dear.
I don't mean to be bitter.
It... It's not your fault.
Another shot in the arm.
Cut out that kind of talk.
Yes, hold your foul tongue and your
rotten broadway loafers lingo!
Have you no pity or decency?
You ought to be
thrown out into the gutter!
If I did it you know damn well
who would weep you...
And plead for you,
and excuse you, and complain...
Until I let you come back.
God! Don't I know that?
No pity?
I have all the pity in the world
for her because I understand...
What a hard game to beat
she is up against.
Which is more than you ever had.
No, the cures are no damn good
except for a while.
The truth is there is no cure
and we've been saps to hope.
They never come back.
"They never come back"
Everything's in the bag,
It's all a frame up,
we're all fall guys...
And suckers and we can't
beat the game.
God, if I felt the way you do...
Oh, I thought you did!
Your poetry isn't very cheery...
Nor the stuff you read
and claim to admire.
Shut up both of you!
There's little choice
between the philosophy...
You learn from broadway loafers...
And the one Edmund got from his books.
They're both rotten to the core.
You both flouted the faith you
were born and brought up in
The one true faith of the Catholic Church
And your denial has brought
nothing but self-destruction.
That's the bunk Papa.
We don't pretend at any rate.
I don't notice you've
worn any holes...
In the knees of your pants
going to mass.
It's true, I'm a bad catholic
in the observance.
God forgive me.
But I believe.
And you're a liar!
I may not go to church but every night
and morning of my life...
I get down on my knees and pray.
Did you pray for Mama?
I did.
I've prayed to God
these many years for her.
But what's the good of talk?
Only, I wish she hadn't led
me into hope this time.
By God! I never will again.
That's a rotten thing to say Papa.
Well I'll hope!
She's only just started,
it can't have got...
A hold on her yet,
she can still stop.
You can't talk to her now, she'll
listen but she won't listen.
Yes, every day from now on will be
the same drifting away from us...
Until at the end of each night...
Cut it out Papa!
I'll go up and get dressed.
I'll make so much noise she can't
suspect I've come up to spy on her.
What did Doc. Hardy say about the kid?
It's what you thought...
He's got consumption.
Damn it!
There's no possible doubt, he says.
Aw hell...
He'll have to go to a sanatorium.
Yes.
The sooner the better, Hardy says,
for him and everyone around him.
He claims...
In six months to a year...
Edmund will be cured, if he obeys orders.
Who would have thought a child of mine?
Doesn't come from
my side of the family.
Wasn't one of us who didn't have
lungs as strong as an ox!
Who gives a damn about that part of it?
Where does Hardy want to send him?
That's what I've to see him about.
Well for God's sake pick out a good place
and not some cheap dump.
I'll send him wherever Hardy thinks best.
Well don't give Hardy your old
over the hills to the poor house song...
About taxes and mortgages.
I'm no millionaire that
can throw money away.
Why shouldn't I tell Hardy the truth?
Because he'll think you want him
to pick a cheap dump.
And because he'll know
it isn't the truth...
Especially if he hears afterwards
you've seen McGuire
And let that flannel-mouth,
gold-brick merchant...
Sting you with another piece
of bum property!
Keep your nose out of my business!
This is Edmund's business!
What I'm afraid of is,
with your Irish bog-trotter idea...
That consumption is fatal,
you'll figure it's a waste of money...
To spend any more
than you can help.
You liar!
All right, prove I'm a liar!
That's what I want,
that's why I brought it up.
I have every hope
Edmund will be cured...
And keep your dirty tongue off Ireland.
You're a fine one to sneer
with a map of it on your face.
Not after I wash my face.
Well...
I've said all I have
to say, it's up to you.
What do you want me to do this afternoon,
now you're going uptown?
I've done all I can do
on the hedge
Until you cut more of it...
And you don't want me to go ahead
with your clipping, I know that.
No, you'd get it crooked.
Like you get everything else.
Well I'd better go uptown
with Edmund then.
Bad news coming
on top of...
What's happened with Mama
may hit him hard.
Yes go with him Jamie...
Keep up his spirits if you can.
If you can without making it
an excuse to get drunk.
What would I use for money?
The last I heard they were still
selling booze not giving it away.
I'll get dressed.
You haven't... Seen my... Glasses...
Anywhere have you... Jamie?
You haven't seen them
have you James?
No my dear.
What's the matter with Jamie?
Have you been nagging
at him again?
You really sh... Shouldn't treat him
with such contempt all the time.
He's not to blame...
If he'd been brought up
in a real home...
I'm sure it would
have been dif...
You're not much of a weather prophet James.
See how hazy it's getting.
I can hardly see the other shore.
Yes I spoke too soon, we're in
for another night of fog I'm afraid.
Well... I won't mind it tonight.
No... I don't imagine you will... Mary.
I... I don't...
See Jamie.
Going down to the hedge.
Where... Where did he go?
He's going with Edmund to the doctor's,
He went upstairs to change his clothes.
I have to do the same
or I'll be late for my appointment.
Please wait a little while.
At least until one of the boys...
Comes down.
You... You'll all be...
Leaving me... So soon.
It's you who are leaving us...
Mary.
Well that... That's a silly thing...
To say James.
How could I leave?
There's nowhere I could go.
Who would I go to see?
I have no friends.
That's your own fault.
Surely there's something that you
could do this afternoon...
That would be good for you Mary.
Take a drive in the automobile!
Get away from the house,
get a little sun and fresh air.
I bought the automobile for you.
You know I don't care for
the damn things...
I'd rather walk any day
or take the trolly.
I had it here waiting for you when
you came back from the sanatorium.
I thought it would give you
pleasure and distract your mind.
You used to ride in it every day,
you hardly use it at all lately.
Payed more money than I could afford.
There's the chauffeur...
I have to feed and board
and pay high wages...
Whether he drives you or not.
Waste!
Same old waste that will land me
in the poor house at my old age.
What good has it done you?
I might as well have thrown
the money out the window.
It was a waste of money James.
You shouldn't have bought
a second hand automobile.
You were swindled again.
As you always are because...
You insist on second hand
bargains in everything.
It's one of the best makes.
You're as bad as Jamie.
Suspecting everyone.
No!
You... You mustn't be offended James.
I... I wasn't offended when
you gave me the automobile.
I knew that was the way
you have to do everything.
I was grateful and touched.
I knew that buying the car was a...
Was a hard thing for you to do.
But it showed how much you love me...
In your way.
Especially...
As you couldn't really believe
it would do me any good.
Mary, dear Mary.
For the love of God
For the boys sake, for my
sake and for your own...
Won't you stop? Now.
Stop what?
What are you talking about?
James...
James we've loved each other,
we always will.
Let's remember only that
and not try to understand...
What we cannot understand or
help things that cannot be helped.
The things...
Life... Has done to us,
we cannot excuse or explain.
You won't... Even try?
Try, uh...
Try to go for a drive?
This afternoon dear?
Oh yes... Yes I... I will if you wish it.
Although...
It... It makes me feel lonelier...
Than if I stayed here.
There...
There's no one I can invite
to drive with me.
I never know where
to tell Smythe to go.
If there was only some
friend's house where I could...
Drop in, laugh and gossip
over a while.
But of course there isn't.
Never has been.
At the convent...
I had so many friends.
Naturally, after I married an actor,
Well...
You... You know how actors
were considered in those days...
And then of course...
Right after we were married
there was the scandal of...
Of that...
Woman who...
Had been your mistress suing you.
From then on,
all my old friends either...
Pitied me or... Cut me dead.
I hated the ones that
cut me dead...
Much less than the pitiers.
Mary for God's sake don't
dig up what's long forgotten.
If you're that far gone
in the past already...
When it's only the beginning
of the afternoon...
What will you be tonight.
Come to think of it...
I do have to drive uptown.
There's something I must
get at the drugstore.
Yes. Leave it to you to have some
of the stuff hidden...
And prescriptions for more!
Well I hope you'll lay in
a good stock ahead...
So we'll never have
another night...
Like the one when you
screamed for it...
And ran out of the house
in your nightdress...
Half crazy to try and throw
yourself off the dock!
I have to get...
Tooth powder...
And toilet soap...
And cold cream.
You mustn't remember,
you mustn't humiliate me so!
Forgive me!
I'm sorry Mary.
It doesn't matter, nothing
like that ever happened.
You must've dreamed it.
I...
I was so...
So healthy...
Before Edmund was born.
Do you remember James?
There wasn't a nerve in my body.
Even traveling with you...
Season after season, bearing children...
In hotel rooms...
I still kept healthy.
But bearing Edmund was...
The last straw.
I was so sick afterwards.
And that ignorant quack
of a cheap hotel doctor...
All he knew was I was in pain.
It was easy for him
to stop the pain.
Mary!
For God's sake, forget the past!
Why, how can I,
the past is the present...
The future too, isn't it?
I blame only myself.
I swore after Eugene died
I would never have another baby.
I was to blame for his death.
If...
If I hadn't left him...
With my mother...
To join you on the road...
Because you wrote telling me you
missed me and were so lonely...
Jamie would never have been allowed,
when he still had measles...
To go into the baby's room.
I always believed Jamie
did it on purpose...
He was jealous of the baby he hated him.
Oh, I...
I... Know Jamie was only seven
but he was never stupid.
He'd been warned it might kill the baby.
He knew.
I've never been able
to forgive him for that.
Are you back to Eugene now?
Can't you let our dead baby
rest in peace?
Above all...
Above all...
I should never have let you insist...
That I have another baby
to take Eugene's place.
I was afraid...
All the time I carried Edmund...
I knew something terrible would happen.
I knew I'd proved
by the way I left Eugene...
That I wasn't worthy
to have another baby.
And that God would punish me if I did.
I should never
have born Edmund.
Mary be careful with your talk...
If he heard you he might think
you never wanted him.
For God's sake try and be yourself...
You can do that much for him.
There you are!
You look spick-and-span.
I'm on my way up to change too.
Wait a minute Papa.
I hate to bring up disagreeable
topic but there's the matter of car fare.
I'm broke.
You'll always be broke until
you learn the value of...
But you've been learning lad.
You worked hard before you took ill.
You've done splendidly, I...
I'm proud of you.
"Thank you".
How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is...
"To have a thankless child", I know.
Give me a chance Papa.
I'm knocked speechless.
This isn't a dollar, it's a ten spot.
But why all of a sudden?
Did doc. Hardy say I was going to die?
That was a rotten crack,
I was just kidding Papa.
I'm very grateful, honest Papa.
You're welcome lad.
I won't have it! Do you hear?
Such morbid nonsense.
Saying you're going to die.
You'd think you didn't want to live...
A boy of your have with
everything before him.
It's just a pose you get
out of books!
You're not really sick at all!
Mary hold your tongue!
But James it's absurd of him
to be so gloomy...
And to make such a big
to-do about nothing.
But never mind dear,
I'm on to you.
You want to be petted and spoiled
and made a fuss over...
Isn't that it?
You're still such a baby.
But please, don't carry it too far dear.
Don't say horrible things.
I know it's foolish
to take them seriously...
But I can't help it!
You've got me so frightened!
I believe you ought to ask
your mother now...
What you said you were...
Going to.
My God! Look at the time!
I have to shake a leg.
How do you feel?
Your head is a little hot...
But that's just from going out in the sun.
You look ever so much better
than you did this morning.
Come and sit down.
- Listen Mama...
- No no now don't talk.
Sit down.
Lean back.
And rest.
It's such a tiring trip uptown in the
dirty old trolley on a hot day like this.
You'll be ever so much
better off here with me.
- Listen Mama...
- You could telephone to Hardy
Tell him you don't feel well enough.
The old idiot, all he knows
about medicine...
Is to look solemn
and preach willpower.
Listen Mama...
I want to ask you something...
You can still stop.
You've only just started,
you've got the willpower
We'll all help you, I'll do anything.
Won't you Mama?
Please don't talk about
things you don't understand.
All right I give up.
I knew it was no use.
Anyway I don't know
what you're referring to...
But I do know you should
be the last one...
Right after I returned from the
sanatorium you began to be ill.
But after they had warned me
I must have peace at home...
Without anything to upset me.
All I've done is worry about you.
But...
That's no excuse.
I'm only trying to explain...
It's not an excuse.
Promise me dear you won't
believe I made you an excuse.
What else can I believe?
Nothing.
I don't blame you.
How can you believe me when
I can't believe myself?
I've become such a liar.
I never lied about anything,
once upon a time.
Now I have to lie...
Especially to myself.
But how can you understand...
When I can't understand myself?
I've never understood anything
about it, except that...
One day...
Long ago...
I found I could no longer
call my soul my own.
But someday...
Dear...
I'll find it again.
Someday when you're all well.
And I see you healthy and
happy and successful.
And I don't have to feel guilty anymore.
Someday...
When the blessed
virgin Mary forgives me.
And gives me back
The faith in her love and pity
I used to have in my convent days.
And I can pray to her again.
When she sees...
No one can believe
in me, even for a moment, anymore...
Then she will believe in me...
And with her help it will be so easy.
I will hear myself scream with agony...
And yet at the same
time I will laugh...
Because I will be so sure of myself.
Well...
But of course you can't...
believe that either can you?
Now I... Now I think of it
You might as well... Go uptown.
I forgot.
I'm taking a drive.
I have to go to the drugstore...
And you'd hardly want to go
there with me would you?
You'd be so ashamed!
Mama don't...
I suppose you'll divide that $10...
Your father gave you with Jamie.
You always divide with
each other don't you?
Like good sports.
Well... I know what he'll
do with his share.
He'll get drunk somewhere
where he can be...
With the only kind of woman
he understands or likes.
Edmund...
Promise me you won't drink.
It's so dangerous.
You know doctor Hardy...
I thought he was an old idiot...
Edmund...
Come on kid, let's beat it!
Go on Edmund.
Jamie's calling.
There comes your father
down the stairs too.
Come on! Edmund.
- Goodbye Mary.
- Goodbye Edmund
If you're coming home
to dinner try not to be late.
Tell your father.
You know how Bridget is.
Goodbye.
Goodbye Mama.
So lonely here.
You're lying to yourself again.
You wanted to get rid of them.
Their contempt and disgust
aren't pleasant company.
You're glad they've gone.
Then mother of God...
Why do I feel so lonely?
That foghorn...
Isn't it awful?
Yes indeed ma'am.
Wasn't the fog I minded,
I really love fog.
They say it's good
for the complexion.
It hides you from the world
and the world from you.
You feel everything has changed,
nothing is what it seemed to be.
No one can find or touch you...
Anymore.
I was scared out of my wits
riding back from town.
You couldn't see your hand in front of you.
It's the foghorn I hate.
It won't let you alone.
It keeps reminding you...
Calling you back.
But it can't tonight,
it's just an ugly sound.
It's...
It doesn't remind me of anything.
Except perhaps Mr. Tyrone's snores.
I've had such fun teasing him about it.
He's always snored...
Ever since I can remember, especially
when he's had too much to drink.
And then he's like a child...
He doesn't like to admit it.
Well... I suppose I snore at times
too and I don't like to admit it.
So I've no right to
make fun of him, have I?
Sure everybody healthy snores...
It's a sign of sanity they say.
What time is it ma'am?
I ought to be getting back
into the kitchen.
No, don't go Cathleen.
I don't want to be alone...
Yet.
It won't be for long.
The master and the boys will be home soon.
I doubt if they'll come home for dinner.
They have too good an excuse...
To remain in the barrooms...
Where they feel at home.
Have a drink yourself,
Cathleen, if you wish.
Well... I don't know
if I'd better ma'am.
Well...
Maybe one won't harm.
Here's to your good health ma'am.
I really did have
good health once Cathleen...
But that was long ago.
For God's sake ma'am...
It'll be half water.
He'll know by the taste.
By the time he gets home...
He'll be too drunk to tell the difference
He has such a good
an excuse, he believes...
To drown his sorrows.
Well... It's a good man's failing...
Never mind his weakness.
I don't mind, I've loved him
dearly for thirty-six years.
That's right ma'am...
Love him dearly...
For any fool can see he worships
the ground you walk on.
Speaking of acting ma'am...
How is it you never went on the stage?
What...?
I?
What put that absurd idea in your head?
I was brought up in a respectable home...
And educated in the best convent...
In the Middle-West before
I met Mr. Tyrone.
I hardly knew there was
such a thing as the theater.
I was a very pious girl.
I even dreamed of becoming a nun.
I never had the slightest
desire to be an actress.
I'd never think of you
being a holy nun ma'am.
Sure to God you'd never darken the
door of a church God forgive me.
Well... I never felt
at home in the theater.
Even though Mr. Tyrone has made
me go with him on all his tours.
I've had...
Little to do with
the people in his company.
Not that I had anything against them...
They were always very kind to
me and I to them but...
their life...
Was not my life.
It's always stood between me and...
And...
But let's not talk about...
Old things that
could not be helped.
How thick the fog is.
I... I can't see the road.
All the people in the
world could pass by...
And I would never know.
I wish it was always that way.
It's getting dark already.
It'll soon be night.
Thank goodness.
It was kind of you to keep me
company this afternoon Cathleen.
I should have been lonely driving up...
Driving uptown alone.
Sure. Why wouldn't I rather
ride in a fine automobile
Than stay here?
It's like a vacation ma'am.
There's only one
thing I didn't like.
What was that Cathleen.
The way the man in the
drugstore acted...
When I took in
the prescription for you.
Oh, the appearance of him.
I d... I don't know what
you're talking about.
What drugstore? What prescrip...
Oh!
Oh yes...
Of course, I'd forgotten.
The medicine for the...
Rheumatism...
In my hands.
What did the man say?
Not that it matter so long
as he filled the prescription.
Oh it mattered to me ma'am.
I'm not used to being
treated like a thief.
He gave me a long look...
And said insultingly
"where did you get hold of this?".
"Well" I says "it's none
of your damn business"...
But if you must know, it's for
the lady I work for...
Mrs. Tyrone who's siting out
there in the automobile.
That shut him up quick.
He gave a long look out
and said...
"Ohh..." and went
to get the medicine.
Yes...
He...
Knows me.
I... Have to take it.
Because there... There is no
other that can...
Stop the pain.
All the pain.
I mean in my hands.
Poor hands.
You'll never believe it but they...
They were once one
of my good points...
Along with my hair...
And eyes.
I had a fine figure too.
They were a musician's hands.
I used to love the piano.
I worked so hard at my
music at the convent.
Mother Elizabeth and my
music teacher both said...
That I had more talent than
any student they remembered.
My father payed for special lessons.
He spoiled me.
He would've sent me to Europe to study...
After I'd graduated from the convent.
I might have gone if I hadn't fallen
in love with Mr. Tyrone...
Or I might have become a nun.
I had two dreams.
To be a nun...
That was the more beautiful one.
To be a concert pianist.
That was the other.
I haven't touched the piano
in so many years.
I couldn't play now with such crippled
fingers even if I wanted to.
Oh, for a time after my...
Marriage... I tried to keep up
my music but it was hopeless.
One night stands...
Cheap hotels, dirty trains,
leaving children, never having a home.
See...
Cathleen?
How ugly they are...
So maimed and crippled.
You'd think they've been through
some horrible accident.
So they have come to think of it.
I won't look at them.
They are worst than the
foghorn at reminding me.
But even they can't hurt me now.
They're far away.
I see them...
But the pain is gone.
You've taken some of that medicine?
If I didn't know better, I'd
think you'd a drop taken.
It kills the pain.
You go back...
Until at last you're...
Beyond it's reach.
Only the past when
you were happy is real.
If you think Mr. Tyrone is
handsome now, Cathleen...
You should have seen him
when I first met him.
He had a reputation of being...
One of the handsomest
men in the country.
Those at the convent
who'd seen him act...
Or seen his photographs
used to rave about him.
He was a big matinee idol then.
Women...
Used to wait at the stage
door just to...
See him come out.
You can imagine how...
Excited I was when my father
wrote telling me...
He and James Tyrone had become friends...
And I...
Was to meet him.
When I went home
for my easter vacation.
I showed the letter to all the girls.
How envious they were.
My father...
Took me to see him act first.
It was a... Play about
the French Revolution
And the...
The leading character...
Was a nobleman.
I couldn't take my eyes off him.
I wept...
When he was thrown in prison
and then was so mad...
Because I was afraid my eyes
and nose would be red.
My... My father had said
we would go backstage...
To his dressing room right after
the play and so we did.
I guess my...
Eyes and nose...
Couldn't have been red after all.
I was really very pretty then actually...
And he was handsomer
than my wildest dreams.
He was different...
Different from all ordinary men
like someone...
From another world.
I fell in love right then.
So did he.
He told me afterwards.
I forgot all about becoming a nun.
Or a concert pianist.
All I wanted was to be his wife.
Thirty-six years ago...
But I can see it...
As clearly...
As if it were tonight.
And...
We've loved each other ever since
And in all those thirty-six years there...
There's never been a breath
of scandal about him.
I mean with another woman.
He's made me very happy Cathleen.
He's a fine gentleman.
You're a lucky woman.
Sentimental fool.
What's so wonderful about the first...
Meeting between a silly
romantic schoolgirl...
And a matineer?
You were much...
Happier before...
You knew he existed.
In the convent...
When you could pray...
To the Blessed Vi... Virgin.
If only I could find the faith I lost.
So I could pray to her again.
Hail Mary full of grace...
Hail Mary full...
Hail Mary full of...
Expect the Blessed Virgin...
To be fooled...
By a lying dope fiend...
Reciting words?
You can't fool her.
I haven't taken enough.
I have to go upstairs.
When you start again you never know...
You never know exactly how much you need.
Why are they coming back?
Why are they coming back?
Are you there?
Mary?
Yes.
Yes I'm... I'm here dear.
In the sitting room.
I've been...
I've been waiting for you.
I'm...
I'm so happy you've come.
I'd given up hope.
I was afraid you
wouldn't come home.
It's such a...
Dismal foggy evening
it must be...
Much more cheerful
in the barrooms uptown...
Where there are people
you can laugh and...
Oh no, don't deny it.
I know how you feel.
I don't blame you a bit.
I'm all the more grateful to you...
For coming home.
I was... Sitting here...
So... Lonely and blue.
Come and sit down.
Dinner won't be ready for a few minutes.
You're... You're... Actually a little early.
Will wonders never cease?
Here's the whiskey dear...
Shall I pour you a drink?
And you, Edmund?
I don't want to encourage you.
But one small one bef...
Before...
Dinner can't...
Do you any harm.
Where's Jamie?
But I... Of course...
He'll never come home
so long as he has...
The price of a date left.
I'm afraid Jamie has been...
Lost to us for a...
Long time..dear.
Oh, for the love of God,
I'm a fool for coming home.
Papa...
Shut up.
Who would've... Thought...
Who would've thought Jamie would...
Would grow up to... Disgrace us.
Everyone liked him, all his...
Teachers told us what
a fine brain he had.
They... They predicted a wonderful
future for him if only he'd...
Learned to take life seriously.
Poor Jamie, such a pity!
It's hard to understa...
No it isn't.
You brought him up to be a boozer.
Since he first opened his eyes
he's seen you drinking.
Always a bottle on the bureau
in the cheap hotel room.
If he had a nightmare when he
was little or a stomach ache...
Your remedy was to give him a...
Tea spoon full of whiskey.
To quiet him.
So I'm to blame because
that lazy hulk...
Has made a drunken loafer of himself?
Is that what I came back to listen to?
Oh, I might have known...
When you have
the poison in you...
You want to blame everyone
but yourself!
Papa!
Are we going to have
this drink or aren't we?
You're right.
I'm a fool to take notice.
Drink hearty lad.
I'm sorry if I...
Sounded bitter James, I'm not.
It's all so far away I...
I was a little hurt when you wished
you hadn't come home.
I was so relieved and...
Happy when you came.
And grateful to you.
It's very dreary
And sad... To be here alone in the fog.
With night falling.
I'm glad I came Mary...
When you act like your real self.
I was so lonesome.
I kept Cathleen with me...
Just to have someone to talk to.
Do you know what I was telling her James?
About that night my... Father
took me to your dressing room.
And I first fell in love
with you, do you remember?
Can you think I'll ever forget Mary?
No.
I know you still love me James.
In spite of everything.
Yes.
As God is my judge.
Always and forever... Mary.
And I...
Love you... Dear.
In spite of everything.
But...
Although I couldn't help loving you,
I would never have...
Married you if I'd known you drank so much.
I remember the... First time your
barroom fellows had to help you...
To the door of out hotel
room and knocked...
And ran away...
Before I opened the door.
We... We were still in our
honeymoon, remember?
I don't remember.
It wasn't on our honeymoon.
I've never in my life
had to be helped to bed.
Or missed a performance.
I waited... In that ugly hotel room...
Hour after hour.
I became terrified, I imagined all sorts
of horrible accidents. I...
Got down on my knees and prayed
that nothing had happened to you.
Then they brought you up and...
Left you outside the door.
God! No wonder.
I'm... I'm sorry I remembered out loud.
I don't want to be sad
Or to make you sad.
I want to remember only the
happy part of the past.
Do you remember our wedding?
The wedding... Dear?
I... I...
Haven't made
such a bad wife, have I?
I'm not complaining Mary.
At least I've loved you dearly...
And I've done the best I could
under the circumstances.
That wedding gown...
Was nearly the death of me.
And the dressmaker too.
I was so particular...
It was never quite good enough.
At last she said she said she refused
to touch it anymore...
"It might spoil it"...
So I made her leave so
I could be alone...
To examine myself in the mirror.
I was so pleased and vain.
I thought to myself...
"You're just as pretty as
any actress he's ever met.
And you don't have to use paint".
Whe... Where is my...
Wedding gown now I wonder.
I...I...
I kept it wrapped up
in tissue paper in my trunk.
I hoped someday I'd have a daughter...
And when it came time
for her to marry...
She couldn't afford a lovely gown.
And I knew James, you'd never
tell her "never mind the cost".
You'd want her to pick up
something at a bargain.
It was made of...
Soft shimmering satin...
Trimmed with...
Wonderful old duchess lace
around the neck and sleeves...
Worked in...
With the folds that were draped
around in a bustle effect at the back.
The bust was bound and
very tight I remember...
I held my...
Breath when it was fitted so my waist
would be as small as possible.
My...
My father...
My father...
Even let me have...
Lace on my
white satin slippers and lace...
With orange blossoms in my... Veil.
How I loved that gown!
It was so...
Beautiful.
Where is it now, I wonder.
I... I...
I... I...
I used to take it out from time
to time when I was lonely.
But it always made me cry and so...
Finally a long while ago...
I wonder where I hid it?
Probably in some old trunk in the
attic, someday I must have a look.
Well!
Isn't it dinner time dear?
You're ever scolding me for being late...
But now I'm on time for once,
it's dinner that's late.
Well if I can't eat yet...
I can drink!
I forgot I had this.
Who's been tampering with my whiskey?
The damn stuff is half water.
Any fool can tell.
Mary, answer me.
I hope to God you haven't
taken to drink on top of...
Shut up Papa!
You treated Cathleen and Bridget...
Isn't that it?
Yes. Yes I wanted to treat Cathleen...
Because I had her...
Drive uptown with me and sent
her to get my prescription...
Filled.
For God's sake Mama!
You can't trust her.
You want everyone
on earth to know?
Know what?
That I suffer from rheumatism in my...
Hands and have to take
medicine to kill the pain?
Why should I be ashamed of that?
I never knew what rheumatism
was before you were bo... Born.
Ask your father.
Don't mind her lad,
it doesn't mean anything.
When it gets to the stage
where she gives...
The old crazy excuse about her hands
she's gone far away from us.
I'm glad you realize that James.
Now perhaps you'll give
up trying to remind me.
You and...
Edmund.
Why don't you light the lights James?
It's getting dark.
I know you hate to but Edmund
has proved to you...
that one bulb burning
doesn't cost much.
It's too bad you let your fear of
the poor house make you too stingy.
I never claimed one bulb costed much.
It's having them
on one here, one there...
Makes the electric light
company rich.
I'm a fool to talk sense to you.
I'll get a fresh bottle of whiskey lad.
We'll have a real drink.
He'll sneak around....
The outside cellar door so the...
Servants won't see him.
He's really ashamed of keeping his
whiskey pad-locked in the cellar.
Oh, your father is a strange man.
Took many years before
I understood him. His...
Father deserted his mother
and their six children...
A year or so after
they came to America.
He told them he had a premonition
he would die soon. He was...
Homesick for Ireland and wanted
to go there to die, so he went...
And he did die.
He must have been a peculiar man too.
Your father had to...
Go to work in a machine shop when
he was only ten years...
For Pete’s sake Mama!
Heard Papa tell that story
ten thousand times.
Yes dear.
You've had to listen.
But I don't think you ever
tried to understand.
Listen Mama.
You're not so far gone yet...
You've forgotten everything.
You haven't asked me what I
found out this afternoon.
Don't you care a damn?
Don't say that.
You hurt me dear.
What I've got is serious Mama.
Doc Hardy knows for sure.
That lying old quack! I
warned you he'd invent...
He called in a specialist
to examine me...
Don't tell me
about doctor Hardy.
- So he'd be absolutely sure.
- If you'd heard what the doctor in the sanatorium...
Who really know something.
I said about
how he treated me...
He said it was a wonder
I hadn't gone mad!
I told him I had once, that time I ran
down in my nightdress to...
Throw myself off the dock.
You remember that don't you?
And you want me to pay attention
to what doctor Hardy says?
- Oh no.
- Listen Mama!
I'm gonna tell you whether
you want to hear it or not.
I've got to go away to a sanatorium.
No!
How dare your father allow him.
You're my baby.
I know why he wants to
send you to a sanitarium.
To take you away from me.
He's been jealous of everyone
of my babies and you most of all.
He knows I love you most
because... You're my...
Stop talking crazy, can't you Mama?
And stop trying to blame him.
And why are you so against
my going away now?
I've been away a lot. And I've never
noticed it broke your heart.
I'm afraid you're not...
Very sensitive dear.
You ought to have guessed that...
After I knew you knew...
About me...
I had to be glad whenever you
were away you couldn't see me.
Don't Mama.
All this talk about...
Loving me, and when I try
to tell you how sick I am....
You're so like your father dear.
Love to be dramatic and tragic so you
can make a scene out of nothing.
If I gave you the slightest
encouragement...
You'd tell me next you're gonna die.
People do die of it.
Your own father...
Why... Why do you mention him?
No comparison at all with you,
he had consumption.
I hate it when you become
morbid and gloomy.
I forbid you to remind me of
my father's death do you hear?
Yes I hear you, Mama.
I wish to God I didn't.
It's... Hard to take at times...
Having...
A dope fiend for a mother.
Forgive me Mama.
I was angry...
And you hurt me.
Just listen to that...
Foghorn.
And the bells.
Why is it...
Fog makes everything sound so sad...
Lost.
I wonder.
I can't say.
I don't want any dinner.
I haven't taken enough,
I have to go upstairs.
I hope sometime without...
Meaning to or...
Take an overdose.
Could never do it deliberately.
The Blessed Virgin would
never forgive me then.
The padlock is all scratched.
That drunken loafer has tried to
pick the lock with a piece of wire...
The way he's done before.
But I fooled him this time.
It's a special padlock a
professional burglar couldn't pick.
Where's Edmund?
He went out.
Perhaps he's...
Gone uptown to find Jamie.
He still had some money left.
I suppose it's burning
a hole in his pocket.
He said he didn't... Want any dinner.
Doesn't seem to have any
appetite these days.
But it's just a summer cold.
Oh... James!
I'm so frightened,
I know he's gonna die!
Don't say that it's not true.
They promised me in six
months he'd be cured.
You don't believe that.
I can tell when you're acting.
An the it'll be all my fault.
I should never have born him.
It would've been better for his sake.
I couldn't have hurt him then.
He wouldn't have had to know
his mother was a dope fiend, then.
Hush Mary...
For the love of God.
He loves you.
He knows it was a curse put upon you
without you knowing or willing it.
He's proud you're his mother!
Hush now, here comes Cathleen.
You don't want her to see you crying.
Dinner is served sir.
Dinner is served ma'am.
Come along dear.
Let's have our dinner.
I'm as hungry as a hunter.
I couldn't...
Possibly eat anything James.
I think you'll have to excuse me.
My... My hands...
Pain me dreadfully.
I think the best thing for me
is to go to bed...
And rest.
Goodnight dear.
Up to take more of that
God damn poison is it?
You'll be like a mad ghost
before the night is over.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You say such mean bitter things
when you've had too much to drink.
You're as bad as Jamie or Edmund.
Who's that?
Is it you Edmund?
Yes!
Turn that light out
before you come in.
Well I'm glad you've come lad,
I've been damn lonely.
You're a fine one to run
away and leave me...
To sit alone here all night
when you know...
I've told you to turn out that light.
We're not giving a ball.
There's no reason to have the house
ablaze with electricity...
At this time of night,
burning up money.
"Ablaze with electricity", one bulb!
Hell everyone leaves a light on in
the front porch until they go to bed.
Ended up busting my knee on the hatstand.
The light from here
shows in the hall.
You could see a way well
enough if you were sober.
If "I" were sober, I like that.
I don't give a damn what other people do.
If they want to be wasteful fools
For the sake of show, let them be.
One bulb! God don't
be such a cheapskate.
I've proved to you by figures you can
leave the light bulb on all night...
It wouldn't be as much as one drink.
To hell with your figures!
The proof is in the
bills I have to pay.
Yes, facts don't
mean a thing do they?
What you want to believe,
that's the only truth.
Shakespeare was an
Irish catholic for example.
So he was. The proof was in his plays.
Well he wasn't, and there is no proof
of it in his plays except to you.
The Duke of Wellington, that was
another good Irish catholic.
I never said he was a good one...
He was a renegade, but a catholic
just the same.
Well he wasn't.
You just want to believe
that no-one...
But an Irish catholic general
could beat Napoleon.
Yes, now I'm not going
to argue with you.
I asked you to turn out
that light in the hall.
I heard you...
And as far as I'm concerned
it stays on.
None of your damned insolence.
Are you going to obey me or not?
Not!
You want to be a crazy miser,
put it out yourself.
Now you listen to me.
I put up with a lot from you
because from the mad things...
You've done at times I thought you
weren't quite right in your head.
I've excused you and never
lifted my hand to you...
But there's a straw that breaks
the camel's back!
You'll obey me and put out that light...
Or big as you are I'll give you
a trashing that will teach you...
I'm sorry lad... Forgive me, I forgot.
You shouldn't goad me
into losing my temper.
Forget it Papa, I apologize too.
I had no right being nasty about nothing.
I'm a bit souse I guess.
I'll put out the damn light.
No. No. No. Stay where you are.
Let it burn.
We'll have them all on.
Let them burn.
To hell with them!
The poor house is the end of the road,
it might as well be sooner as later.
That's a grand curtain.
You're a wonder Papa.
That's right, laugh
at the poor old man.
The poor old ham.
But the final curtain will be
in the poor house just he same.
And that's not comedy.
Well, well let's not argue.
You'll live to learn the value of a dollar.
You're not like that damned
tramp of a brother.
I've given up hope he'll ever get sense.
Where is he, by the way?
How would I know?
I thought you went
back uptown to meet him.
No, I walked down by the beach.
I haven't seen him since
this afternoon.
Well if you shared the money
I gave you like a fool...
Sure I did. He always staked
me when he had anything.
It doesn't take a soothsayer to tell
he's probably in the whorehouse.
Oh, for God's sake Papa!
If you're gonna
start that stuff again I'll beat it.
All right. All right. I'll stop. God
knows I don't like the subject either.
Will you join me in a drink?
Now you're talking!
I'm wrong to treat you,
you've had enough already...
But if you walked all the way to the beach
you must be damp and chilled.
Oh, I dropped in at the inn
on the way out and back.
Not the night I'd
pick for a long walk.
I love the fog.
It was what I needed.
You should have more sense
than to risk...
Oh, to hell with sense!!
The fog was where I wanted to be.
Halfway down the path you
can't see this house.
You'd never even know it was here.
Everything looked and sounded unreal.
It was like...
Walking on the bottom of the sea.
As if I'd drowned long ago.
As if I was a ghost, belonging to the fog.
And the fog was the ghost of the sea.
It felt damn peaceful to nothing
more than a ghost within a ghost.
Don't look at me as if I'd gone nutty.
Who wants to see life as it
is, if they can help it?
You've a poet in you but
it's a damn morbid one.
Devil take your pessimism!
I'm low spirited enough.
Why can't you remember
your Shakespeare?
You'll find what you were
trying to say in him.
"We are such stuff as dreams are made on...
And our little life is
rounded with a sleep"
Fine.
That's beautiful.
But I wasn't trying to say that.
We are such stuff as
manure is made on...
So let's drink up and forget it,
that's more my idea.
Keep such sentiments to yourself.
I shouldn't have given
you that drink.
It did pack a wallop all right.
On you too.
Even if you never missed
a performance.
What's wrong with being drunk?
It's what were after isn't it?
"Be always drunken...
Nothing else matters...
That is the only question"
"If you would not feel the
horrible burden of time...
Weighing on your shoulders and
crushing you to the earth"...
"Be drunken continually".
"Be drunken with what?
With wine, with poetry
or virtue as you will"...
"But be drunken...
And if sometimes on the stairs
of a palace"...
"Or on the green side of a ditch...
Or in the dreary solitude
of your own room"...
"You should awaken
and the drunkenness...
Be half of wholly
slipped away from you"
"Ask of the wind...
Or of the wave, or of the star,
or of the bird, or of the clock...
Of whatever flies, or sighs, or rocks,
or sings, or speaks"...
"Ask what hour it is...
And the wind, the wave, star,
bird, clock will answer you"...
"It is the hour to be drunken...
Be drunken continually"...
"With wine, with poetry or with virtue.
As you will"...
Well I wouldn't worry about the
virtue part of it if I were you.
But you recited it well lad.
Who wrote it?
Baudelaire.
Never heard of him.
Where do you get your taste in authors?
This damned library of yours...
Voltaire and Rousseau and Schopenhauer...
And Ibsen!
Atheists, fools and madmen!
And your poet this... Baudelaire.
And Swinburne and Oscar Wilde,
Whitman and Poe!
Whore-mongers and degenerates.
But I have three good sets of Shakespeare
there, you could read.
They say he was a souse too.
They lie.
I don't doubt he liked his glass,
it's a good man's failing...
But he knew how to drink
that it didn't poison his mind...
With morbidness and filth.
Don't compare him with the
pack you've got here.
Your dirty Zola!
And your...
Dante Gabriel Rossetti...
Who was a dope fiend...
Perhaps it would be wise
to change the subject.
You can't accuse me of
not knowing Shakespeare.
Didn't I win five dollars
from you once...
When you bet me I couldn't learn
a leading part of his in a week...
As you used to do
in stock in the old days?
I learned Macbeth and recited it
letter perfect with you...
Giving me the cues.
That's true, so you did.
And a terrible ordeal it was, I remember
hearing you murder the lines.
I kept wishing I'd paid over the
bet without making you prove it.
Did you hear?
She's moving around.
I hope to God she doesn't come down.
Yes, she'd be nothing more than a
ghost haunting the past by this time.
Back before I was born.
Doesn't she do the same with me?
You must take her memories
with a grain of salt.
Her wonderful home was ordinary enough.
Her father wasn't the great noble
Irish gentleman she makes out.
Oh, he was a nice enough man,
good company a good talker.
I liked him and he liked me.
He was prosperous enough too
in his wholesale grocery business.
An able man.
But he had his weakness.
She condemns my drinking...
But she forgets his.
Oh, it's true he never touched a drop
until he was forty...
But after that he made up for lost time.
He became a steady champagne drinker.
The worst kind.
That was his grand pose.
To drink only champagne.
Well, it finished him quick.
That and the consumption.
We don't seem to be able to
avoid unpleasant topics, do we?
No.
Well, what do you say to a game
or two of casino, lad?
All right.
We can't lock up and go to bed until
Jamie comes on the last trolley.
Which I hope he won't.
I don't want to go upstairs anyway.
So she's gone to sleep.
Neither do I.
As I told you before...
You must take her tales of the past...
With a grain of salt.
The piano playing...
And her dream of becoming
a concert pianist...
It was put in her head by the nuns
flattering her.
She was their pet.
They loved her for being so devout
And the idea she might have
become a nun...
That's the worst.
Your mother was one of the most
beautiful girls you ever could see.
She knew it too.
She was a bit of a rogue
and a coquette...
God bless her, behind all her
shyness and blushes.
She was never made to renounce the world.
She was bursting with health and
high spirits and the love of loving.
Oh, for God's sake Papa,
pick up your hand.
Yes. Yes.
Let's see what I have here.
Listen!
She's coming downstairs.
Let's play our game,
pretend not to notice.
She'll soon go up again.
I don't see her...
She must have started down...
and turned back.
Thank God!
Yes.
It's pretty horrible to see
her the way she must be now.
She's been terribly frightened about
your illness for all her pretending.
Oh, don't be too hard on her lad,
remember she's not responsible.
I know damn well
she's not to blame.
And I know who is.
You are.
Your damned stinginess.
If you'd spent money on a decent
doctor when she was so sick...
After I was born, she would never
known morphine existed.
You must try to see my side of it too lad.
How was I to know he was
that kind of doctor?
He'd a good reputation.
Among the souses in the
hotel bar I suppose.
You lie! I asked the hotel
proprietor to recommend the best...
At the same time crying "poor house"...
And making it plain
you wanted a cheap one.
I know your system.
God! I ought to
after this afternoon.
What about this afternoon?
Never mind now.
We're talking about Mama.
I'm saying no matter how you try
and excuse yourself...
You know damn well
your stinginess was to blame.
Well I say you're a liar...
Shut your mouth right now or...
After you'd found out she'd been
made a morphine addict...
Why didn't you send her to
a cure then, at the start...
When she still had a chance?
What did I know about morphine?
It was years before I
discovered what was wrong.
Why didn't I send her to a cure you say?
I've spent thousands on thousands
in cures, a waste!
What have they done her?
She's always started again.
Yes, it's because you've
never given her anything
That would help her
want to stay off it.
No home except this summer...
Dump in a place she hates...
And you've refused to spend money
even to make this look decent.
While you keep buying
more property...
And playing sucker for
every con-man with a...
Gold mine or a silver mine or any
other get rich quick swindle.
You've dragged her around the road,
season after season...
On one night stands with no one
she could talk to.
Waiting night after night
in dirty hotel rooms
For you to come home with a bun on
after the bar has closed.
It isn't any wonder she
didn't want to be cured.
God... God!
When I think of it
I hate your guts!
Edmund! How dare you talk
to your father like that?
You insolent young cub!
After all I've done for you.
We'll come to that,
what you're doing for me.
Will you stop repeating your
mother's crazy accusations?
I've never dragged her
on the road against her will....
Naturally I wanted her
with me, I loved her.
And she came
because she loved me...
And wanted to be with me,
that's the truth.
And she needn't have been lonely...
She had her children...
And I insisted, despite the expense...
On having a nurse to travel with her.
Yes, your one generosity.
And that...
Because you were jealous of
her spending too much time with us.
And wanted us out of your way.
And that was another mistake too.
If she had to take care
of me all by herself...
And had that to occupy her mind.
Maybe she'd been able to stop.
Oh, for that matter since
you insist on judging things...
By what she says when she's not
in her right mind...
If you'd never been born she'd never...
Sure.
I know that's how she feels Papa.
She doesn't.
She loves you as dearly as
ever a mother loved a son.
I've only said that because
you've put me in such a...
God damned rage!
Making up the past...
Saying you hate me.
I didn't mean it Papa.
I'm like Mama.
I can't help liking you...
in spite of everything.
Well I might say the same of you.
You're no great shakes as a son.
It's a case of
"A poor thing but mine own".
Well, what's happened to our game?
Who's play is it?
Yours, I guess.
You mustn't let yourself get
too down hearted lad...
By the bad news you had today.
Both doctors promised me...
If you obey orders, at this place
you're going...
You'll be cured in six months...
Or a year at most.
Don't kid me...
You think I'm gonna die.
That's a lie! You're crazy!
So why waste money?
That's why you're sending me
to a state farm.
What state farm?
It's the Hill Town Sanatorium,
that's all I know.
Both doctors told me
it's the best place for you.
For the money. Or for nothing
or practically nothing.
Don't lie, Papa.
You know damn well Hill Town Sanatorium
is a state institution.
Jamie suspected you'd cry
"poor house" to Hardy...
And he wormed the truth out of him.
That drunken loafer!
I'll kick him out in the gutter!
He's poisoned your mind
against me...
Ever since you were
old enough to listen.
You can't deny it's true
about the state farm, can you?
Not trough the way you look at it!
What if it is run by the state,
that's nothing against it.
The state has money
to make a better place...
Than any private sanatorium...
And why shouldn't I
take advantage of it?
It's my right and yours,
we're residents...
I'm a property owner.
I help to support it.
I'm taxed to death here...!
Yes, on property valued
at a quarter of a million.
Lies. That's all mortgaged.
Hardy and the specialist
know what you're worth.
All I told them was
I was no millionaire...
That could afford such a sanatorium
Because I was land poor.
That's the truth.
And then you went to the club
and you met McGuire...
And "let him... Stick you, with another
bum piece of property".
- It's not true.
- Don't worry about it.
We met McGuire in the...
Hotel bar after you left.
Jamie kidded him about hooking you...
And he winked and laughed.
- You liar.
- Don't lie about it!
God Papa!
Ever since I went to see him
was I on my own and...
Found out what it felt like
to be broke and starved.
And I tried to be fair to you...
Because I knew what you
were up against as a kid.
I tried to make allowances.
You have to make allowances
in this damn family or you'll go nuts.
But to think when it's a question
of your own son having consumption...
You can show yourself up
before the whole town...
As being such a stinking old tightwad!
Don't you know Hardy will talk
and the whole damn town will know?
God, Papa, haven't you any
pride or shame?
And don't think I'll let you
get away with it.
I won't go to any damn state farm
just to save you a few lousy dollars...
To buy some more bum property with!
You stinking old miser!
Be quiet!
Don't say a thing!
You're drunk!
I won't mind you!
Stop coughing, lad.
Got so worked up over nothing.
Who said you had to go
to this Hill Town place?
You can go anywhere you like.
I don't care a damn what it costs...
All I care about is having you get well.
You call me a...
Stinking miser?
Just because I don't want
doctors to think...
I'm a millionaire they can swindle?
You look weak, lad.
Better, take a bracer.
Thanks.
Well...
Who's play is it?
"A stinking old miser"
Well maybe you're right.
Maybe I can't help being....
Although all my life,
since I had anything...
I've thrown money over the bar
to buy drinks for everyone in the house...
Or loaned money to sponges
I knew would never pay back.
But of course that was in bar rooms
when I was full of whiskey.
Can't feel that way about it
when I'm sober in my home.
It was at home
I first learned the value...
Of a dollar and the fear
of the poor house.
I've never been able to
believe in my luck since.
You said you realize what
I'd been up against as a boy.
The hell you do. How could you?
You had everything.
Nurses, schools...
Oh, I know you've had a spell
of hard work with your back and hands...
And a bit of being
homeless and penniless...
In a foreign land
and I respect you for it.
But it was a game of romance
and adventure to you...
It was play!
Yes, particularly the time I tried to
commit suicide at Jimmy the Priest's...
And almost did.
You weren't in your right mind.
No son of mine would ever...
You were drunk.
I was stone cold sober.
That was the trouble.
I stopped to think too long.
Don't start your damned
atheist morbidness again.
I don't care to listen.
I was trying to make plain to you.
What do you know of the value of a dollar?
When I was ten...
My father deserted my mother
and went back to Ireland to die.
Which he did, soon enough...
And deserved to and I hope
he's roasting in hell.
He mistook rat poison for flour
or sugar or something...
There was gossip
it wasn't by mistake...
But that's a lie.
- No one in my family would ever...
- My bet is it wasn't by mistake.
More morbidness.
Your brother put that in your head.
The worst he can suspect
is the only truth for him.
But never mind.
My mother was left...
A stranger in a strange land
with four small children.
There was no damned romance in our poverty.
Twice we were evicted from the
miserable hovel we called home.
My mother's few sticks of furniture
thrown out on the gutter.
My mother and sisters crying.
I cried too, though
I tried hard not to.
But I was the man of the family...
At ten years old.
There was no more school for me.
I went to work twelve hours a day
in a machine shop.
Learning to make files.
Dirty barn of a place where
rain dripped through the roof.
You roasted in the summer,
there was no stove in winter.
Your hands were numb with cold.
The only light came through
two small filthy windows.
So on gray days I'd have
to sit bent over...
My eyes almost touching
the files in order to see.
You talk of work!
What do you think I got for it?
Fifty cents a week.
It's the truth. Fifty cents a week.
My poor mother washed
and scrubbed for the yanks.
Well I remember one Thanksgiving...
Or maybe it was Christmas...
Some Yank, in whose house mother
had been scrubbing,
Gave her a dollar extra for a present.
On the way home
she spent it all on food.
I remember her hugging and
kissing us and saying...
Tears of joy running down
her tired face,
"Glory be to God!
For once in our lives
there will be enough for each of us."
Fine brave sweet woman!
Never was a finer or a braver!
Yes, she must have been.
It was in those days I
learned to be a miser.
A dollar was worth so much then.
Once you've learned the lesson
it's hard to unlearn it.
You have to look for bargains.
If I took this state farm for a good
bargain, you'll have to forgive me.
The doctors did tell me
it was a good place...
You must believe that Edmund.
But I swear I never meant for you
to go there if you didn't want to.
You can go to any place you
choose, never mind what it costs.
Any place...
I can afford. Any place...
Within reason.
What about our game?
- Whose play is it?
- I don't know.
Mine I guess.
No it's yours.
Yes.
Maybe life overdid the lesson for me
And made a dollar worth too much.
And that mistake...
Ruined my career as a fine actor.
I've never admitted this
to anyone before lad.
But tonight I’m so heartsick I feel
at the end of everything...
And what’s the use of
fake pride and pretense?
That God damned play
I bought for a song...
And made such a great success in...
A great money success...
It ruined me with it's promise
of an easy fortune.
I didn't want to do anything else.
By the time I woke up to the fact
I'd become a slave to the damn thing...
And did try other plays,
it was too late.
They'd identified me
with that one part...
And didn't want me in anything else.
They were right too.
I'd lost the great talent I once had
through years of easy repetition.
Never learning a new part,
never really working hard.
Thirty-five to forty thousand dollars
net profit a season!
Like snapping your fingers.
Yet before I bought the damn thing...
I was considered one of
the three or four young actors...
With the greatest artistic
promise in America.
I'd work like hell!
I left a good job as a machinist...
To take supers' parts because
I loved the theater.
I was wild with ambition.
I read all the plays ever written.
I studied Shakespeare as
you'd study the Bible.
I got rid of an Irish brogue
you could cut with a knife.
I loved Shakespeare. I'd have acted
in any of his plays for nothing.
For the joy of being alive
in his great poetry.
I could have been a great
Shakespearean actor if I'd kept on.
In 1874 when Edwin Booth...
Came to the theater in Chicago
where I was leading man.
I played Cassius to his Brutus one night.
Brutus to his Cassius the next.
Othello to his Iago and so on.
First night I played Othello
he said to our manager...
"That young man is playing Othello
better than I ever did."
That from Booth!
The greatest actor of his day or any other.
As I look back on it now, that night
was the highest spot of my career.
I had life where I wanted it.
But for a time after that I kept on
with ambition high...
Married your mother.
Ask her what I was like in those days.
Her love was an added
incentive... To ambition.
Then a few years later my good bad
luck made me find the big money maker.
And then life had me where it wanted me.
At from thirty-five to forty
thousand net profit a season.
A fortune in those days.
Even in these.
What the hell was it I wanted to
buy, I wonder, that was worth...
Oh well...
It's a late day for regrets.
My play isn't it?
I'm glad you told me this Papa.
I know you a lot better now.
Maybe I shouldn't have told you.
Maybe you'll only feel more
contempt for me.
It's a poor way to convince
you of the value of a dollar.
The glare from those extra
lights hurts my eyes.
You don't mind if I turn
them out do you?
We don't need them.
There's no point in making the electric
company light company rich.
No, sure not. Turn them out.
No, I don't know what the
hell it was I wanted to buy.
On my solemn oath, Edmund.
I'd gladly face not having an acre
of land to call my own...
Nor a penny in the bank
I'd be willing to have no home but
the poor house in my old age...
If I could look back now on having been
the fine artist I might have been.
What the devil are you laughing at?
Oh, not at you Papa.
At life... It's so damned crazy.
More of your morbidness!
There's nothing wrong with life.
It's we who...
"The fault... Dear Brutus...
Is not in our stars but in ourselves
that we are underlings"
The praise Edwin Booth gave my Othello!
I made our manager write down
his exact words in writing.
I kept it in my wallet for years.
I used to read it every once in a while.
Until, finally, it made me feel so
bad I couldn't face it anymore.
Where is it now, I wonder?
Somewhere in this house.
I remember I put it away carefully.
Might be in an old trunk in the attic...
Along with Mama's wedding dress.
Oh, for Pete’s sake Papa, if we're
gonna play cards, let's play.
She's still moving around.
God knows when she'll go to sleep!
Oh, for God's sake
Papa, forget it!
You just told me some high spots
in your memories.
Want to hear mine?
They're all connected with the sea.
Here's one. When I was on the
Squarehead square rigger...
Bound for Buenos Aires.
Full moon in the Trades, the old
hooker driving fourteen knots.
I lay on the bowsprit, facing astern
The water foaming into spume under me,
The masts with every sail
white in the moonlight...
Towering high above me.
I became drunk with the beauty
and singing rhythm of it,
And for a moment I lost myself...
Actually lost my life.
I was set free!
I dissolved in the sea...
Became white sails and flying spray...
Became beauty and rhythm...
Became the ship...
And the moonlight and the
high dim-starred sky!
I belonged, without past or future.
Within peace, and unity...
And a wild joy.
To something greater than
my own life, or the life of Man.
To Life itself.
To God, if you want to put it that way.
And several other times in my life...
When I was swimming far out there,
Lying alone on a beach,
I've had the same experience.
Became the sun... The hot sand,
Green seaweed anchored to a rock...
Swaying in the tide.
Like a Saint's vision of Beatitude.
Like the veil of things...
As it seems drawn back
by an unseen hand.
For a second you see,
And seeing the secret... Are the secret.
For a second there is meaning!
Then the...
Hand lets the veil fall
And you're alone,
lost in the fog again.
It's a great mistake
my being born a man...
I'd have been much more successful
as a seagull or a fish.
As it is...
I'll always be a stranger
who can never really feel at home.
Who does not really want...
Is not really wanted
And never never really belong...
And... Who must always be
a little in love with death.
Yes, you've the makings of a poet
in you all right.
The makings of a poet?
No, I'm afraid I'm like the guy...
Who's always panhandling for a smoke.
He hasn't even got the makings,
he's only got the habit.
I couldn't touch what I was
trying to tell you just now...
I only stammered.
It's the best I'll ever do,
I mean, if I live.
That's faithful realism at least.
Stammering is the native eloquence of us
fog people.
Well, that sounds like absent brother.
He must have a peach of a bun on.
That loafer!
He caught the last car.
Bad luck to it.
Get him to bed, Edmund.
I'll go out on the back porch.
He has a tongue like an adder
when he's drunk.
I'd only lose my temper.
What hooo...! What...?
Nix on the loud noise.
Hello, kid.
I'm as drunk as a fiddler's bitch.
Thanks for telling me
your great secret.
Yeah. Unnecessary information
number one.
I had a serious accident.
Front steps tried to trample on me.
Took advantage of the fog...
Ought to be another lighthouse out there.
It's dark in here too.
What the hell is this, the morgue?
"Ford, ford, ford o' Kabul
river in the dark!"
"Keep the crossing-stakes beside you...
An' they will surely guide you.
'Cross the ford o' Kabul
river in the dark."
There!
That's more like it.
To hell with the old Gaspard!
Where is that old tight wad?
He's out on the porch.
He expects us to live in a...
Black hole in Calcutta!
Say...
Have I got the DTs?
My God!
It's real!
Hey what's the matter
with the old man?
He must be ossified
to forget he left this out.
Grab opportunity by the forelock!
It's the key to my success.
You're stinking now.
That'll knock you stiff.
Wisdom from the mouth of babes.
Can the wise stuff, kid.
You're still wet behind the ears.
All right!
Pass out if you want to.
I can't, that's the trouble.
I've had enough to sink a ship...
But I can't sink!
Well... Here's hoping.
I'll have one too.
No, no you don't!
Not while I'm around.
Remember doctors orders.
Maybe no one else gives a damn
if you die.
But I do.
You're my kid brother.
I love your guts, kid.
Everything else is gone
and you're all I got left.
So no booze for you
if I can help it.
Oh, lay off.
You don't believe I care, eh?
Just drunken bull!
All right go ahead and kill yourself.
Sure I know you care, Jamie.
And I'm going on the wagon.
But tonight doesn't count.
Too many damned things
have happened today.
Here's how.
Yeah, I know, kid.
It's been a lousy day for you.
I bet old Gaspard hasn't tried
to keep you off the booze.
He'll probably give you a case...
To take with you to the state farm
for pauper patients.
The sooner you kick the bucket,
the less expense.
Yeah, well uh...
What a bastard to have for a father.
God, if you put him in a book
no one would believe it.
Oh, uh... Papa's all right if you
try and understand him...
And keep your sense of humor.
He's been putting on the old
sob act for you?
He could always fool you but not me.
Never again.
Though I do feel...
Sorry for him
in a way about one thing.
Well, he had that coming to him.
He's to blame.
To hell with that.
The last drink is really
getting to me...
This one ought to put
the lights out.
Hey, did you tell old Gaspard
that I got it out of Doc Hardy...
The sanatorium
was a charity dump?
Yes.
I told him I wouldn't go there.
It's all settled now.
He said I can go anywhere I want.
Within reason, of course.
Yes, "Of course, my boy...
Anything...
Within reason".
That means another cheap dump!
Old Gaspard, the miser in "The Bells".
That's a part he can play
without make-up.
I've heard that Gaspard stuff
a million times.
All right, if you're satisfied,
let him get away with it.
It's your funeral.
I mean...
I hope it won't be.
What did you do uptown tonight?
Go to Mamie Burns?
Sure thing!
Where else would I find suitable
feminine companionship?
And love.
Don't forget love.
What is man without
a good woman to love?
A goddamn hollow hole.
You're a nut.
Hey...
Guess which one
of Mamie's charmers...
I picked to bless me
with her woman's love.
It'll hand you a laugh, kid.
I picked...
Fat Violet.
- No, honest?
- Yeah.
No!
Some pick!
God! Oh, God!
She weighs a ton.
What the hell for, a joke?
Oh, no, no joke.
Very serious.
By the time I hit Mamie's dump...
I was feeling very sorry for myself...
And all the other poor
bums in the world.
Ready for a weep on any old
womanly bosom.
You know how you get when
the Old John barley corn...
Turns on the soft music inside of you.
And the as soon as I hit the door,
Mamie began telling me her troubles.
She beefed how rotten business was.
She was going to give
Fat Violet the gate.
The customers didn't fall for Vi...
The only reason she kept her
was she could play the piano.
Well, lately Violet has
been going on drunks...
And been getting to boiled to play...
And was eating her
out of house and home.
And how old Vi was a
good hearted dumbbell...
And she felt sorry for her 'cause...
She didn't know how in the hell
he'd make a living.
Still... Business was business.
She couldn't afford to run a home
for fat tarts.
Well it made me...
Feel very sorry for Fat Violet.
So I squandered two bucks...
Of your dough...
To escort her upstairs.
Now, with no dishonorable
intentions whatever.
I like them fat...
But not that fat.
All I wanted was a little
heart to heart talk...
Concerning the infinite sorrow of life.
Oh, poor Vi!
She stood it for a while,
Then she got good and sore.
Got the idea I'd taken her
upstairs as a joke.
Gave me a grand bawling out.
Then she began to cry.
So I had to say I loved her...
Because she was fat.
And she wanted to believe that.
And I stayed with her...
To prove it.
And that cheered her up.
She kissed me when I left.
Said she'd fallen hard for me.
And we both cried a little more
in the hallway...
And everything was fine.
Except Mamie Burns thought
I'd gone bughouse.
Harlots and hunted have
pleasures of their own to give...
The vulgar herd can never understand.
Exactly!
And a hell of a good time at that.
This night has opened mine eyes...
To a great career
in store for me, my boy.
I shall give the art of acting back
to the performing seals,
Which are it's most perfect expression,
By applying my natural
God given talents...
In their proper sphere...
I shall attain the pinnacle of success!
I’ll be the lover of the fat woman
in a Barnum and Bailey Circus.
Imagine me...
Sunk to the fat girl...
In a hick town hooker shop.
Me!
I've had some of the best lookers
on Broadway sit up and beg.
"Speakin' in general,
oh, I’ve tried 'em all.
The 'appy roads which take you
o'er the world."
It's not so apt.
Happy roads is bunk.
Weary roads is right.
They get you nowhere fast.
And that's where I got...
Nowhere.
Where everyone lands in the end...
Even if most of the suckers
won't admit it.
Oh, can it!
You'll be crying in a minute.
Hey!
Don't get too damn fresh.
But you're right,
the hell with repining!
Fat Violet is a good kid.
I'm glad I stayed with her.
It was a Christian act.
Cured her blues,
a hell of a good time.
You should have stuck around
with me, kid.
Taken your mind off your troubles.
What's the use of coming home?
To get the blues over what
can't be helped.
It's all over.
Finished!
You know?
Not a hope.
"If I were hanged... On the highest hill,
Mother o' mine...
Oh, mother o’ mine!
I know whose love... Would
follow me still..."
Shut up!
Where's the hop head?
Gone to sleep?
You dirty bastard!
Thanks, kid.
I certainly had that coming.
I don't know what made me.
Booze talking, you know me, kid.
Good God, Jamie.
No matter how drunk you are,
there's no excuse.
I'm sorry, I...
You and I never...
Scrapped that bad.
Sorry, kid.
Glad you did.
My dirty tongue, I'd like to cut it out.
It was because I feel
so damn sunk.
Because this time Mama
had me fooled.
I suppose I can't forgive her yet.
It meant so much...
I'd began to hope that if she'd
beaten the game...
Maybe I could too.
Good God, don't I know
how you feel!
Oh, God!
I've known about Mama
so much longer than you.
I'll never forget the first time
I got wise.
I caught her in the act with a hypo.
God!
I never believed before
That anyone but whores took dope.
Stop it, Jamie.
And then this stuff of your
getting consumption.
It's... Got me licked.
We've been more than brothers.
You're the only pal I ever had.
I love your guts kid,
I'd do anything for you.
I know that, Jamie.
Yeah.
I bet you heard Mama
and old Gaspard...
Spilling so much bunk about my
hoping for the worst.
You suspect right now I'm thinking
to myself...
That Papa is old...
Can't last much longer...
And if you were to die...
Mama and I would get all he's got.
So I'm probably hoping...
Shut up you, damn fool!
What the hell put that in your nut?
That's what I'd like to know.
What put that in your mind?
Oh, don't be a dumbbell.
What I said...
I'm always suspected of hoping for
the worst I got, so I can't help it.
Hey!
What are you trying to do?
Accuse me?
Now don't you play
the wise guy with me!
I've learned more about life
than you'll ever know.
Just because you read
a lot of high brow junk...
Don't think you can fool me!
You're only an overgrown kid.
Mama's baby, Papa's pet,
the family white hope. The...
You're getting a swelled head
lately about nothing.
About a few poems,
in a hick town newspaper.
Hell, I used to write better stuff
for the lit magazine in college.
You better wake up!
You're setting no rivers on fire.
You let these hick town boobs
here flatter you...
With bunk about your future...
Hell, kid...
Forget that.
That goes for Sweeney.
You know I didn't mean it.
No one is prouder...
You started to make good.
Oh, why shouldn't I be proud, uh?
You reflect credit on me.
I had more to do with bringing you up
than anybody.
I wised you up about women, so
you'd never be the fall guy...
And make any mistakes
you didn't want to make.
And who steered you on to reading
that poetry first, uh?
Swinburne, for example?
I did!
And because I once wanted to write...
I put it in your head that someday
you'd write!
Hell, you're more than my brother.
I made you!
You are my Frankenstein!
All right.
I'm your Frankenstein.
So...
Let's have another drink?
You crazy nut.
No.
I'll have a drink...
Not you.
I got to take care of you.
Listen, kid...
You'll be going away.
I may not get another chance to talk
or I may not be...
Drunk enough to tell you the truth.
So I got to tell you now...
Something I ought to have
told you a long time ago...
For your own good.
And no drunken bull!
But in vino veritas.
Uh?
You better take this seriously.
I wanna warn you...
Against me.
Mama and Papa are right.
I've been a rotten bad influence.
But worst of all is...
I did it on purpose.
- I don't want to hear anymore.
- Yes, kid!
You listen...
I did it on purpose...
To make a bum out of you.
Part of me did a big part.
The part that's been dead
so long that hates life.
My putting you wise
so you'd learn from my mistakes, uh?
Well, I believed that myself at times,
but it's a fake.
It made my mistakes look good.
Made getting drunk romantic.
Made whores fascinating vampires
Instead of poor, stupid, diseased
slobs they really are.
Made fun of work...
as a sucker's game.
I never wanted you to succeed...
And make me look even worse
by comparison.
Wanted you to fail!
Always jealous of ya!
Mama's baby!
Papa's pet!
And it was your being born that started
Mama on dope.
I know that's not your fault
but all the same...
Goddamn you!
I can't help hating your guts.
- Cut it out, Jamie.
- Don't get me wrong, kid.
I love you more than I hate you.
My telling what I'm telling
you now proves it.
Because I run the risk you'll hate me
and you're all I got left.
I didn't mean...
To tell you all that last stuff.
To that far back,
I don't know what made me.
What I wanted to say is...
I'd like to see you become
the greatest success in the world.
But you better be on your guard,
Because I'm gonna do my damnedest
to make you fail.
I can't help it.
I hate myself.
I got to take revenge
on everyone else, especially you.
The dead part of me hopes
you won't get well.
Maybe he's even glad
the game's got Mama again.
He wants... Company!
He doesn't want to be
the only corpse around the house.
God, Jamie.
You're crazy.
Now, you think it over,
you'll see I'm right.
Think it over!
When you're away from me
in the sanatorium.
Make up your mind.
You gotta tie a can to me,
Get me out of your life...
Think of me as dead!
Tell people...
"I had a brother, but he's dead".
And when you come back
you look out for me!
Because I'll be waiting to welcome you
here with that "My old pal" stuff
And give you the glad hand...
And the first good chance I get...
I'm gonna stab you in the back!
Shut up!
I'll be goddamned if I'll listen to...
Only don't you forget me.
Remember I warned you for your sake.
Come on!
Give me credit!
"Greater love hath no man than this...
That he saveth his brother...
From himself."
That's all.
I'm finished now. I've...
Gone to confession.
I know you absolve me,
don't you, kid?
You understand.
You're a damn fine kid.
You ought to be.
I made you.
So go...
And get well.
Don't die on me, you're all I got left.
God bless, kid.
That last drink...
The old K.O.
Thank God he's asleep.
I thought he'd never stop talking.
Better let him stay where he is
and sleep it off.
I heard the last part of his talk.
It's what I warned you.
I hope you'll heed the warning
now it comes from his own mouth.
You mustn't take it
too much to heart though, lad.
He loves to exaggerate the worst
in himself when he's drunk.
He's devoted to you.
It's the one good thing left in him.
A sweet spectacle for me...
My firstborn...
Who I hoped would bear my name
in honor and dignity,
Who showed such brilliant promise.
Be quiet, can't you, Papa?
A waste.
A wreck.
A drunken hulk.
Done with and finished.
"Clarence... Is come...
False, fleeting, perjured Clarence...
That stabb'd me in the field
by Tewksbury...
Seize on him, Furies,
and take him in to torment."
What the hell are you staring at?
"Look in my face...
My name is Might-have-been.
I am also called No-more, Too-late,
Farewell."
I'm well aware of that and
God knows I don't want to look at it.
Quit it!
You know, I got a great idea
for you, Papa.
Put on a revival of
"The Bells" this season...
There's a great part in there
you can play without make-up.
Old Gaspard, the miser!
Shut up, Jamie!
I claim that Edwin Booth...
Never saw the day...
When he could give as good a performance
as a trained seal!
Seals are intelligent and honest...
They don't put on any bluffs
about "the art of acting"...
They admit they're just hams...
Earning their daily fish.
You loafer!
Papa! Do you wanna start a row
that'll bring Mama down?
Jamie, go to sleep.
You shot off your mouth
too much already.
All right, kid.
I'm not looking for an argument.
Too damn sick.
Oh, I wish to God you'd go
to bed so that I could too.
I'm dumb tired.
I can't stay up all night
like I used to.
I'm getting old.... Old and finished.
I can't keep my eyes open.
I think I'll catch a few winks.
Why don't you do the same, Edmund?
It'll pass the time until she...
"A mad scene."
"Enter Ophelia"
Good boy, Edmund!
The dirty blaggard!
His own mother!
All right, kid. I had that coming.
But I told you how much I hoped.
I'll kick you out in the gutter tomorrow...
So help me God!
Papa.
Jamie.
For the love of God!
Stop it.
I play so badly now.
I'm all out of practice.
Sister Theresa will give me
a dreadful scolding.
She'll tell me it isn't
fair to my father...
When he spent so much money
for extra lessons.
She's quite right.
It isn't fair when he's so good
and generous and so proud of me.
I'll practice everyday from now on.
Something...
Horrible has happened to my hands.
The fingers have gotten all stiff...
The knuckles are all
swollen, they're so ugly.
I'll go to the infirmary and show
sister Martha.
She's old and a little cranky
but I love her just the same.
She has things in her medicine chest
that'll cure anything.
She'll give me something
to rub on my hands...
And tell me to pray
to the Blessed Virgin.
I'll be well again in no time.
Let... Let me see...
What did I...
Come here...
To find?
It's terrible...
How absent-minded I've become.
Always dreaming and forgetting.
Here!
Let me take it, dear.
You'll only step on it...
And then you'll be sorry afterwards.
Thank you. You're very kind.
It's a wedding gown,
it's very lovely isn't it?
I remember now...
I found it...
In the attic hidden in a trunk.
I... I don't know what I wanted it for.
I'm going to be a nun.
That is...
If I can only...
Find...
What is it I'm looking for?
I know it's something I lost.
Mary.
No good, Papa.
Something I...
I miss...
Terribly.
It... It can't be altogether lost.
Mama...
Something...
What's the use?
I need terribly.
I remember...
When I had it I was never lonely
nor afraid.
I can't have lost it forever.
I'd die if I know that.
Because then
there would be no hope.
Mama.
It's not just a summer cold.
I've got consumption.
No. No!
You must not try to hold me.
You must not try to touch me.
You damn fool, it's no good.
It's not right when I'm hoping to be a nun.
We're fools to pay any attention.
It's the damn poison.
I never knew her drown herself
in it as deep as this before.
Pass me that bottle, Jamie.
I had a talk with mother Elizabeth.
She's so sweet and good.
A Saint on earth.
I love her dearly.
It may be...
Sinful of me, but I love her better
than my own mother
Because she always understands
even before you say a word.
Her kind blue eyes look right
into your heart.
Can't keep any secrets from her.
You couldn't deceive her
even if you were mean enough to want to.
All the same...
I... I don't think she was
so understanding this time.
I told her I wanted to be a nun.
I explained how sure I was of my vocation.
That I'd prayed to the Blessed Virgin
to make me sure and to find me worthy.
I told mother...
I had had a true vision...
When I was praying in the shrine
of our Lady of Lords...
On the little island in the lake.
I said I knew as surely
as I knew I was kneeling there
That the Blessed Virgin had smiled
And given me her consent.
But mother Elizabeth said I must be
more sure than that even...
That I must prove it...
Wasn't simply my imagination.
She said if I was so sure...
Then I wouldn't mind putting
myself to a test...
By going home after I'd graduated
and living as other girls live...
Going out to parties...
And dances and enjoy myself
And then...
If after a year or two I still felt sure...
I could come back to see her...
And we would talk it over again.
I never...
Dreamed the Holy Mother
would give me such advice.
I was really shocked!
I said...
Naturally I... I would do anything
she suggested but...
I knew it was simply a waste of time.
After...
I left her I felt...
All mixed up.
So I went to the shrine
And I prayed to the Blessed Virgin...
And found peace again...
Because I knew she heard my prayer...
And would always love me...
And see no harm...
Ever came to me...
So long...
So long...
As I never lost my faith in her.
That was in the winter of...
Senior year.
Then in the spring...
Something happened to me.
Oh, yes, I remember.
I fell in love with James Tyrone
And was so happy...
For a time.
