Ain't but one kind of blues.
And that consisted between
male and female that's in love.
In love, just like
I sung one of them songs a while ago
and I put a verse in there
saying that love hide all fault
and make you do things
you don 't wanna do.
Love sometimes
will leave you feeling sad and blue.
I'm talking about the blues!
I ain 't talking about monkey junk.
And it consisted
between male and female.
And that means two people,
supposed to be in love
when one or the other
deceives the other through their love.
Ronnie?
Are you okay? Baby?
Baby. Baby.
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.
I never Iaid a hand on her in anger.
Not one time, R.L.
Not even when I was drinking.
But this here business
got me wondering
what a good shake and slap
would do for her.
We gonna keep that talk
between us now.
Don't you go in there
with that shit on your tongue.
I ain't start this shit, R.L.
You wanna pray with me
before you go in, Laz?
Heavenly Father, we do not question
your divine plan for us,
but in these times,
when our spirit Iies in shadow,
when we are Iost,
we ask for your strength.
We ask for strength
to surpass all understanding.
In your name we pray. Amen.
Can't remember the Iast time
I saw you in that suit.
At your mamma's funeral.

You gots to change, rotate the crop.
Gotta have change,

Hell, girl, you gotta cut that shit out.
Laying up under all them fools,

A man or woman
that enters into union with AImighty God
in the sanctity of marriage,
should not demean theyselves
by bending to another's will.
Hell, girl, is you crazy?

You know, some dresses and such
and maybe some shoes.
But they gotta be nice things,
you know, proper things for a woman.
You know, things that make a woman

Well, that makes it easier.

What happened up yonder at the house,
that wasn't your fault.
Ain't a young man alive
could've kept his pants on
with that girl in heat Iike she is.
Why she got a chain on her?
Well, now, that's between me and her,
that's private.
So,
-that your first time?
-Yes, sir.
Shit! I remember my first time
was out behind my uncle's barn
with my second cousin.
Man, that girl must've weighed two tons
if she weighed a pound.
Could've done a Iot better for myself.
Hell, Iook Iike you sure enough did.
-You want a cigarette?
-No, sir.
that's usually what you do
when you get through, you know.
You either smoke
or Ieave them smoking.
-You a preacher?
-that's right.
Can I ask you a question?
You know how people are always
saying, you gotta get right with Jesus
if you want not to go to hell, you know.
Gotta say you're sorry
and Jesus will Iet you into heaven.
You can put it that way.
that's so fucking stupid.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I don't mean to curse. I just...
No, no, no. What's on your mind?
What's on your mind?
You can't go around hurting people
and then just
say you're sorry
and it all gets washed away.
Why would heaven
want people Iike that?
I'm gonna tell you something,
and it's just gonna be
between you and me.
I think folks
carry on about heaven too much.
Like it's some kind of
all-you-can-eat buffet up in the clouds,
and folks just do as they're told
so they can eat what they want
behind some pearly gates.
there's sin in my heart.
there's evil in the world.
But when I got no one, I talk to God.
I ask for strength.
I ask for forgiveness.
Not peace at the end of my days
when I got no more Iife to Iive
or no more good to do, but today.
Right now.
What's your heaven?
Ronnie.
Holy shit.
Hey, Jim, Iet's get Ronnie set up here.
thank you.
Hey, Herman.
Hey, Ronnie.
they buy you that Big Chicken Dinner?
the what?
they got different names
for things in the Corps
when they trying to get rid of you.
I don't know what it's Iike in the Guard,
but there's a thing called the
Bad Conduct Discharge, a BCD.
It's not the same as the brig,
but it'II sure fuck you up for Iife
if you ever wanna work
for the government.
How do you get one of them deals?
Well, blowing boys in the head...
Well, blowing boys in the head...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, son!
I ain't saying shit about you.
I'm just talking.
You don't know what you're
talking about, so shut the fuck up!
AII right, man. AII right! It's all right!
Hey, Herman. Come on, man.
He just got back. Shit.
to get back
he had to have gone somewhere.
-Fuck you!
-AII right, man.
-Come on, sit down.
-God damn it.
So what happened?
they been keeping a folder on me
'cause of my stomach.
Like how I used to get before games
back in school.
I can't shoot.
I mean, target practice, I'm a pro.
I can tag
right between the numbers, but...
Something happens
when I get around Ioud noises.
I get shaky and start to Iose my breath.
they called it anxiety.
Severe anxiety.
Anyway, they sent me home.
I guess it could be worse.
Could be coming back in a body bag.
Hey, I can't get Rae on the phone.
I mean, I called, she's not at home.
None of her friends
seem to know where she is.
She's around.
AIways is.
I don't know. I just feel Iike
something bad's happened.
You'd tell me
if you knew something, right?
Now that's sharp. that is sharp.
You ain't had no trouble with that chain,
did you?
No.
Well, steaks is on.
Potatoes is boiling.
R.L. and Lincoln are out there
grilling the corn.
I'm about to throw these biscuits
in the oven.
-What you know how to fix?
-I don't fucking cook.
You know, Rae, I known a whole bunch
of hard-cussing people in my day...
AII right, all right. Now, Iook.
I put the goddamn dress on, okay?
I think I'm handling myself
with a Iittle bit of fucking restraint,
how you got me chained up here
Iike I'm some kind of dog!
Rae. Rae!
I ain't arguing with you.
AII I'm saying is
I know you got more in you than filth.
-You saying you can't cook nothing?
-No.
-Can you boil water?
-I think I can handle that.
AII right. Get to handling it.
-We gonna eat with her?
-that's what I'm told.
-She still gonna have that chain on?
-Well, I'm working on that.
We ask you to bless this meal
put before us.
May this food nourish our bodies
and may the fellowship
nourish our spirit.
In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
Amen.
Y'all Iet me know
if these steaks is too dry, all right?
And don't be shy now.
Got plenty over here.
-this all Iooks wonderful.
-I skipped Iunch today.
these eggs got a Iittle kick to them.
What you put in this?
I expect you need to ask the chef here.
Cayenne pepper.
Rae?
Rae?
Kitchen Iooks just Iike I Ieft it.
She ever tell you
she was thinking of taking off?
You know how she gets!
With her history...
God damn!
I guess I could see
how she could get scared.
AII right. AII right, man.
Sit down.
Her mamma works down
at the grocery down on the square.
-Hell, maybe she's seen her.
-Ronnie.
You can't see it
'cause you're too close to it.
Anxiety spells you get,
you never had that shit back in school.
-that's not true...
-You joined up in that monkey troop
'cause you had a plan for yourself!
Army's gonna pay for school.
Gonna get yourself a degree.
Maybe something in business
or agriculture.
You were gonna
make something of yourself.
then you had to go and fall in Iove
with the school slut.
Hey, I know about how she was Iike.
Hey, I was the only one
she talked to about it.
How she was abused.
-t errible things, Gill.
-Bullshit.
t errible things. things you
don't even wanna know about.
You had a plan!
You had a goddamn Iife
and she just fucked the guts out of you!
She had to take care of me
the whole time!
Shit, I'd start throwing up, choking!
And I got better. You know?
And since we been together
she put all that junk behind her.
She been faithful.
First weekend away,
when you was off playing soldier
on Saturdays,
I come over, drop off spare keys
Iike you want me to.
You weren't gone two hours
and she was aching
to get me inside of her.
I mean, every time you Ieave town,
that pussy's up for grabs.
You're a Iiar.
Is that right?
Don't you think it's funny how I know
where everything in your house is?
I don't care if that hurts you or not.
I really don't.
truth is
I don't even know who you are anymore.
I don't even know who you are anymore.
So fuck it.
-You gonna steal my truck now?
-Make yourself at home.
You've done it already.
-You take it straight?
-Sure.
Jesus!
-You want another one?
-Sure.
We drinking buddies now?
t o

Still making jokes.
this ain't no joke.
Come here.
It ain't on me to change your Iife
or nobody else's.
Shit. People gonna do
what the hell they wanna do anyway.
You ain't got but one Iife.
You ought to Iive it the way you want.
I can take you back to town now
if you want.
Laz,
will you do something for me?
Whatever you want.
I ain't played for nobody in years.
I wanted me some kids,
a whole mess of them.
But for Rose, my wife,
kids is for another time.
then one spring,
I seened a change in her.
Her breasts started swelling up.
Couple of mornings,
I hear her in the bathroom throwing up.
I done seen it in other women before,
so I knew.
then one day,
Rose said she had to go to Jackson,
visit her folks,
and she ain't wanted me to go,
so I stayed here.
You know how they talk about a woman
having that glow?
She didn't have it no more.
She done cut it out.
Got rid of it.
that voice in my head,
every time I think it's gone,
it comes howling back.
Calls me when I'm ailing,
when I can't find my way home.
Lost in the pines.
I calls it the Black Snake Moan.
Black snake all in my room
Black snake all in my room
Some pretty mamma
Better get this black snake soon
Sing, Laz. PIease keep singing.
Black snake is evil
Black snake is all I see
Black snake is evil
Black snake is all I see
Woke up this morning
Black snake moved in on me
-Where you gonna be?
-I'm gonna be right here.
-Be here all afternoon.
-Okay.

that'd be nice.
And I got that Iotion on you gave me.
Can you smell it?
Now that's nice, too.
Hey.
What happened to your face?
I got in a Iittle accident.
I was thinking,
since you're working on the square now,
if you wanted to, we could get coffee
or something some morning.
-You need money again?
-No.
No, I...
Why we always gotta do this?
You and me been at each other
as far back as I can remember.
I'm your daughter.
-I'm the only family you got.
-You never needed nobody, Rae.
You always made that
perfectly clear to me.
I know I did.
But I'm trying to be different, you know.
I'm trying to get some peace.
Yeah, well, I'm working here now.
Can't you see that?
I just wanted some makeup.
AII that shit's on aisle five.
I just think you should've
kept him off me, that's all.
-What the hell are you talking about?
-Now don't do that, Mamma.
I will go along
with all the crap you talk about me,
but you can't pretend no more on that.
'Cause I was just a kid.
I didn't know
about all that shit he was doing to me.
And you Iet him do it.
Some big nobody in your Iife and you
Iet him do whatever the fuck he wanted!
No. Okay. AII right. I'm sorry, Mamma.
I didn't mean to shout.
Sorry, I didn't mean to get upset.
I just...
AII my Iife I've been
putting out your fires
while you been giving out your snatch
to every wagging dick in this town!
And now you're gonna
put the blame at my feet?
Mamma, if we can just talk about it.
If you could just tell me,
we could be eye to eye on this.
I'm just not gonna take your shit.
No, I'm not.
You don't have to say you're sorry!
Just tell me how you knew!
the only thing I'm sorry for
is for ever Iistening to my parents
and having you
and not doing what I should've done.
t ell me you didn't know,
you goddamn Iiar! t ell me!
You fucking Iiar!
Fuck you!
You were in the next goddamn room,

What you be doing with yourself

I was thinking about singing in the choir.
Up at the church?
-Why don't you sing me something?
-When? Now?
-Yeah.
-Oh, no.
Come on now, don't be shy.
Just go ahead and Iet it out.

This here's my woman
That chacha will do you no good
Whoa! Y eah!
This here a song from back in the day
Nineteen hundred and sixty-two
My woman put my black ass
out in the cold
I said, "Baby, why you leaving?"
She said, "Our love done gone cold"
Well, I waded through water
and I waded through mud
Till I come to this place
they call the Bucket of Blood
You know, that bartender
give me a dirty look and a dirty glass
I said, "Say, motherfucker!
Do you know who I am?"
He said, "Hell no, nigger!
I don 't give a goddamn!"
I reached down in my pocket
and pulled out my shiny. 44
Shot that motherfucker twice!
He hit the goddamn floor
'Bout that time
you could've heard the drop of a pin
That's when that bad motherfucker
Billy Lyons walked in
'Bout that time a pimp eased up
and turned out the lights
That's when I had old Billy Lyons
dead in my sights
When the lights come back on
old Billy gone to rest
I pumped nine of my bullets
in his motherfucking chest!
Sometime, that kind of blues
will make you even kill one another
or do anything that kind of low.
It goes here, on this side.
That's where the blues started.
It ain 't on this side. It's over here.
This little light of mine

I don't know where I Iearned it.
But I can't play.
How you feeling?
You know how you feel

You know, Iike you could

Yeah. Yeah, I'm there.
I got up real early this morning.
You know, the sun was shining.
And I thought

-You can.
-No, I can't.
Yeah, you can.
Right here. Right here, see?

Ronnie!
No!
It ain't been but a week
and you already some nigger's whore.
Oh, did you think I wouldn't find out?
Did you think I wouldn't find out?
Gill told me how you and him...
How you and everybody...
Did you have fun with her, huh?
Sweet as a peach, I bet! Huh?
-No!
-Shut up, bitch! Shut the fuck up!
Be careful where you aim that gun, boy.
Or what? Huh?
Or what?
You come to talk, boy,
or you come to kill somebody?
You ain't gonna be calling me boy
when I blow your fucking face off!
Boy, you so green
you couldn't stomp a baby duck.
Are you testing me? Huh?
Just what kind of test
would that be, huh?
t est if you're a man?
If you're a killer?
Hell, that ain't hard to find out, is it?
AII you gotta do is pull that trigger back.
Go on.
Go ahead.
-Okay, Ronnie...
-God damn it, Rae!
Keep that gun trained on me, boy.
Now, you wanna kill a man,
and all you need's a reason, right?
Well, you know
she been out here with me.
Been all over town giving up that switch
you thought was yours.
-Shut up!
-Give all your Iove to one woman
and she give it to another man.
Now that's a reason to kill a man there.
then won't be no questions.
She'II know you a man!
-A real killer!
-Don't say that to me!
I'm too old to play house or cowboys.
You gonna do it or get out of my face.
Go on.
Do it!
Ronnie. Ronnie.
Ronnie, baby, Iook at me.
Ronnie, Iook at me. Look at me.
Come on, Iook at me.
Baby, it's all right. I got you. I got you.
Come on. Come on.
Hold on. Hold on, baby.
-Hey, it's me.
-It's okay.
I need you to get over here.
Yeah, right now!
We did a Iot of dreaming, me and Rae.
Made big plans to get out.
I'd go do my tour and move out of here.
Maybe go to Knoxville.
But when Rae
gets Iike she does
and does the things
that she does...
Go on, Ronnie. Go on.
-this is fucking stupid.
-Go on.
What Rae did for me,
she fixed me.
But I can't fix her.
Rae,
we don't wanna fix you or judge you.
Only you and the good Lord can do that.
But I want you to tell me
about these spells you get.
Well,
I get these thoughts in my head,
you know.
Like shit I done
or shit that's been done to me,
and I can't get them out.
And it burns, you know, it hurts.
It starts in my head
and moves down to my hands,
and my stomach, and then Iower, and...
You know, sometimes I can stop them
but mostly I can't.
the only thing that ever
made that feel better was Ronnie
'cause I Iove him so much.
Why don't you Iook at Ronnie
and tell him how you feel?
I think... I think we're fucked up.
Both of us. I mean, I know I am.
But that don't mean
that what I feel isn't real,
that I can't Iove somebody.
And I know how I've been
and what I've done is real, real bad.
But...
So if you wanna quit on me,
I understand.
But please don't.
So,
what you two gonna do about this?
Hi, Miss Angie.
You wasn't at your work
so I just figured I'd drop by.
What you need?
I need your help again.
More cough syrup?
Come on.
Shit.
You Ronnie?
Yeah.
I'm Lincoln.
I'm gonna be your best man.
Okay.
You having trouble with that tie?
'Cause I'm pretty good at it.
Gotta do it Iike this
or I'II get all turned around.
Laz, she's ready.
Ain't she pretty?
I'II give y'all some time together.
Now that is sharp!
Girl, you sharp as a tack.
OId Miss EIIa Mae done you right,
didn't she?
-Yeah.
-You Iike it?
I've had nice things before
but, you know,
I always seem to ruin them somehow.
this here one yours.
I know you gonna take care of it.
-I'm gonna try. But, Laz...
-Hey, hey.
We ain't gonna have
no talk Iike that today, all right?
You and me, we gonna get through this.
We gonna be just fine.
You go on and Iive your Iife.
Get your shit together and Iive your Iife.
Okay.
I don't want you to Iet go of me.
You and me,
we always gonna have hope
to each other.
When I was a child, I talked like a child,
I thought like a child,
I reasoned like a child.
When I became a man,
I put aside my childish ways.
AII right. You got her now.
And now these three remain,
faith, hope and love.
But the greatest of these is love.
Ronnie?
I gotta pull over.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine
This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine
This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine
Baby.
See?
See? We're okay.
We're okay.
