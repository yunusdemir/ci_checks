How are you today?
You feeling good?
I bet you'd like something to eat.
Here. I've got something
in my pocket here.
Some goodies. I'll set the table
for you here, OK?
That's good.
Do I have to put signs up here
to keep you guys off my grass?
I'm sorry.
Get out of the way!
What do you think you're doing?
Look out!
Did you see the way that Lowell
threw that rake at me?
- Why don't you lay off Lowell for a bit?
- We're just having a little fun.
Now what is this?
Really nice catch.
You guys are outrageous.
Listen, Wolfie,
we've been here for six months.
We got six months more to go.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
He told me a story this morning about
how they're gonna refoliate the earth.
Again?!
Let's set this thing up
the way it was before?
It missed. It failed.
First time!
Let's stop playing with this thing, OK?
I'll tell you this for old flower-face,
he sure knows how to play this thing.
Plenty of time to practise.
Lowell!
- How about a little of the old poker?
- Later.
On this first day of a new century,...
..we humbly beg forgiveness...
..and dedicate these last forests...
..of our once beautiful nation,...
..in the hope that
they will one day return...
..and grace our foul earth.
Until that day,...
..may God bless these gardens...
..and the brave men who care for them.
- Three.
- Three.
Dealer takes one.
The deck's still open. Your bet, Barker.
50.
50...
And 100.
Guts.
Come on, son. Throw it on in.
I fold.
You bet $50 and then you're folding?
Right.
Well, boys, there's a three.
And there's another three.
And there are three big bullets.
I will just reach in
and gather up the telepors.
- Beats me.
- You bet it does.
I wish they'd hurry up with
that transmission. I wanna go to bed.
I suggest that you reach
deep down inside yourself...
..and try and find something
to keep you awake a little longer,...
..because this transmission coming up
may just rekindle your will to live.
You think it'll be a recall?
Let's just say that
I feel my communications...
..may finally bear some fruit.
Cantaloupes, maybe.
I'll let that witticism slide by,...
..because it's my feeling
that they're about to re-establish...
..the parks and forests system.
- With you as director?
- You can think of anybody better?
More qualified?
- Really, it's...
- No, wait a second.
Let me just ask him a question here.
I've spent my last eight years
up here, dedicated to this project.
Now, can you think of
anybody more qualified?
It's more likely that
they're gonna announce cutbacks.
Sorry. There's no way they'll announce
cutbacks, not after this amount of time.
Lowell, you're dreaming.
And you don't think it's time
somebody had a dream again?
You don't think that it's time that
somebody cared enough to have a dream?
What about the forests? You don't
think anyone should care about them?
What's gonna happen if these forests and
all this incredible beauty is lost for ever?
It's been too long, Lowell.
People have got other things to do now.
Hi, this is for Valley Forge,
Berkshire, Sequoia.
This is Com Central. Channel open
for executive order AUC3423.
Listen to this, boys.
This is Anderson speaking.
Boys, I have to make an announcement.
We have just received orders to abandon...
..and nuclear-destruct all the forests...
..and return our ships
to commercial service.
I received no explanation...
..and we must begin at 0900
in the morning.
May God have mercy on us all.
- This is it! We're goin' home!
- I can't believe it!
- I told you! What'd I say?
- We pack up those domes and go home.
Destruct all forest units.
Kiss 'em goodbye, boys.
Lowell, I'm sorry.
It makes sense, you know?
It's insane.
Let's go.
How far out do they go before they blow?
About six miles.
We should feel a hefty jolt.
- I want a front-row seat when they go!
- I'll bet you do.
Lowell, do you have to eat
that stuff in here? It stinks.
You never let up, do you?
Now you hurt his feelings.
I'd like to know what
any one of you knows about real food.
What do you mean, real food?
Out of the dirt? That's real food?
That's right. This happens
to be nature's greatest gift.
To a celibate, maybe.
Come on, you guys.
Maybe he knows something we don't.
Lowell, give me a slice
of that cantaloupe.
Don't ask Lowell for a slice.
I'd be delighted to give you a slice of it.
Just sit down and shut up.
Sit down. Sit down!
And shut up and leave me alone,
all of you, and let me eat.
What's the big deal? I can't see
the difference between that and this.
You don't see the difference?
The difference is that I grew it.
That's what the difference is.
I picked it and I fixed it.
And it has a taste, and it has some colour
and it has a smell.
It calls back a time when there
were flowers all over the earth.
There were valleys, and there were
plains of tall green grass...
..that you could lie down in,
that you could go to sleep in.
There were blue skies
and there was fresh air.
There were things growing everywhere,
not just in domes...
..blasted millions of miles out into space.
Look at that stuff. How can you guys sit
there and say anything to me about this?
Look at this crap! Look at that!
Dried, synthetic crap!
You've become so dependent on it,
I bet you can't even live without it.
Why would we want to, Lowell?
Don't you realise how pitiful that is,
what you just asked me?
On earth, everywhere you go,
the temperature is 75º.
Everything is the same.
All the people are exactly the same.
Now, what kind of life is that?
- So why do you wanna go back?
- Because it's not too late to change it.
What do you want, Lowell?
There's hardly any more disease.
There's no more poverty.
Nobody's out of a job.
That's right. Every time we have
the argument, you say the same thing.
You give me the same three answers.
"Everybody has a job."
That's always the last one.
But you know what else there is
no more of? There is no more beauty.
There's no more imagination and no
frontiers left to conquer. You know why?
One reason why. The same attitude that
you guys are givin' me in this room today.
And that is: nobody cares.
Look on the wall behind you.
Look at that little girl's face.
I know you've seen it.
But you know what she's never
gonna be able to see?
She's never gonna be able to see
the simple wonder of a leaf in her hand,...
..because there's not gonna be any trees.
Now, you think about that.
If people were interested, something
would've been done a long time ago.
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.
Wait a minute. I don't think
you guys understand what this means.
Please don't blow up the domes.
- Which one first?
- Outboard cluster first. Let's hit six.
- They're not disposable.
- I haven't got any choice, Lowell.
They're not replaceable.
Where's that tube?
- My hand.
- Are you all right?
- You better get Lowell to fix that for you.
- Damn.
Really.
Will you help me?
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Get on in here now.
Valley Forge. Safe-distancing
manoeuvre in five minutes.
Valley Forge, please stand by...
..for 1000 hours safe-distancing
manoeuvre in five minutes.
I'm gonna need your help for that,
you know, Lowell?
- There you go.
- Thank you.
Here.
Set gyro at 4406.
This is Berkshire.
You there, Marty?
I'm on it, Neal.
OK, we're counting down
for your 4406 distancing,...
..about 20 seconds.
- Set for distancing.
- Right.
Eight, seven, six, five...
..four, three, two, one. That's a go.
Thanks, Marty. We 're clear.
Stand by for updates.
Andy.
- The bomb, please.
- All right.
Loaded and ready to go.
99909 plus 49.
04 plus 8.
Right!
OK, looks real good. That's a go.
We're ready for some
real fireworks here. 25 seconds.
We're looking forward to it, too, Neal.
Keep a steady hand, Marty.
Don't want one ofyou getting hurt.
Right. Will do.
Where the hell is Lowell now?
I think I saw him near One
with some empty flowerpots.
That must be Berkshire.
Do we need this?
Andy, easy with that.
No, we use the panel. It's safer.
- John, would you get those lights?
- Sure.
Nothin' up on the board.
- Well, set six.
- Gotcha.
- OK. Arm six.
- Armed.
Hit it.
No.
You're not comin' in here.
- What are you doin'?
- You're not comin' in here.
- Look, I know how you feel.
- If you knew how I felt,...
..you wouldn't be in here with that.
I'm on a tight schedule
and I don't wanna fight.
I don't care. You are not
using those things in my forest.
- I ain't got time to argue. Now, move!
- You're not gonna do it.
You can't blow up this forest.
Valley Forge.
Come in, Valley Forge. Reading 4040.
Berkshire to Valley Forge. Come in,
Valley Forge. Berkshire to Valley Forge.
Valley Forge. Come in, Valley Forge.
Reading 4040.
Berkshire to Valley Forge.
Come in, Valley Forge.
Valley Forge to Berkshire.
You still there, Neal?
- Yes. Barker?
- No, it's Lowell.
What's the trouble, Lowell?
We seem to be experiencing some kind
of problem with the main coupling.
Might be one of
your squib pins severing.
That's what we figured it was,...
..so we've gone ahead
and we're setting it now.
We'll be getting back to you
just as soon as we can.
Roger.
Lowell.
Everything OK over there?
A- OK. Everything's OK.
We'll wait to hear, buddy.
Roger.
Drone one,...
..drone two, drone three,...
..please report immediately
to the main cargo area.
Berkshire to Valley Forge.
Come in, Valley Forge. Berkshire
to Valley Forge. Come in, Valley Forge.
Berkshire to Valley Forge.
Come in, Valley Forge.
Come in. Berkshire to Valley Forge.
Valley Forge to Berkshire.
Come in, Berkshire.
- How's it goin', Lowell?
- It's not goin' too well, Neal.
We're gonna have to torch those pins.
Better move on it, buddy.
Darkness coming up on you, 33201.
- Right. We'll try our best.
- Boys here are getting anxious for home.
I understand.
Coming into darkness at 33201.
Right.
Blow it any old way you can, Lowell.
Big Billy wants to go.
We're tryin'.
Yellowstone, Arcadia, Blue Ridge,
Mohave report final jettisons.
We got a hold on Valley Forge.
Right.
Berkshire to Valley Forge. You're
entering darkness. Lowell, do you read?
- Right, Neal. We hear ya.
- Big Billy says blow it anyway, Lowell.
- Screw Big Billy.
- Didn't catch that, buddy.
Nothin'. I just said
we're right on it, Neal. We're tryin'.
Valley Forge. What's wrong?
You're moving out. You're accelerating.
Valley Forge. Berkshire to Valley Forge.
I have an emergency ignition
on Valley Forge, reading red 990.
I get a two-four on Valley Forge,
reading red.
Valley Forge to Berkshire,
I've got an emergency.
- Neal? Can you read me, Neal?
- I read you.
I've got a main bus blowout on numbers
three, eight and ten panels.
I've got a premature detonation on dome
two and an explosion in the cargo deck.
Now, please advise me immediately.
I read you. Put on Wolf, Lowell.
No, change that. Give me Barker.
I can't find Barker or Wolf
or Keenan either.
I'm afraid they might have
been in dome number two.
God, dome two just blew up. Stand by.
Wolf, Keenan and Barker missing.
What the hell is taking so long?
Coming up now, Valley Forge.
Lowell, this is Anderson.
How are you, boy?
I'm OK.
Lowell, ifyou continue as is, we figure...
..you'll hit the northeastern quadrant of
Saturn's rings at 302 tomorrow morning.
- What does that mean?
- We don't think you'll make it through.
It's a very bad angle. These ships
weren't built to shoot the rapids.
The plan is to find where the explosion
chopped the main bus and re-route it.
You'll have to do some cutting.
Where do I start?
We tracked a bunch of cargo modules,
probably offyour starboard side,...
..so we figure maybe one of the cryo
tanks under the floor cut loose.
It may have exposed the main bus duct,
if we're lucky.
I'll take a look at it.
Drone number one.
This'll stop 'em.
I need you guys to help me fix my leg.
From now on, you guys
are working for me.
Here's a little medical program.
Drone one,...
..drone two, drone three,...
..please report immediately to surgery.
Drone number two,...
..you'll perform the operation.
Drone number three,
you'll handle the oxygen anaesthesia.
Drone number one.
Number one, you'll assist.
Commander Anderson.
I can't get anywhere near
that main bus duct.
Everything's just all torn up down there.
Listen, Freeman.
That's your first name, right?
Yes.
- Any family, Freeman?
- No, sir.
Well, listen, Freeman.
You've been with this project since
the start, and you've known the risks.
Yes, sir.
I don't really know
how to say this, Freeman.
It's all right, sir.
- We've got some trouble.
- I figured.
Yes.
- I'm really sorry, Freeman.
- Sorry, sir? About what?
We'll never be able to stop you
before you hit the rings.
I see.
Freeman, you might want to consider...
Suicide, sir?
No.
I just don't think that I'd ever
be able to do anything like that.
Well, the best we can do, then, is send
out a search party the long way around.
But it's kind of like a needle in a haystack,
ifyou know what I mean.
Yes, sir.
- Freeman?
- Yes, sir?
God bless you, Freeman.
You're a hell of an American.
Thank you, sir.
I think I am.
Drone number three.
Drone number three, keep moving.
Follow one and two.
Follow one and two!
Why didn't you follow them?
Now dig a hole for him.
Make it seven feet long...
and three feet wide.
OK, now, put him...
put him down in it.
And then remain there,
cos I would like to say something...
..before you cover him over.
I would like to be able to say a prayer...
..but I don't...
..really know how to say it.
Wolf and Barker and Keenan,...
..they weren't exactly my friends.
But I did like them.
And...
..I don't... I don't think...
..that I'll ever be able to...
..excuse what it is that I did,...
..but I had to do it.
And...
I guess that's all that I have to say.
You can cover him over now.
Boys,...
..I'd like to make an announcement. Um...
From now on,...
..drone number two,...
..you will answer to the name of Huey.
And drone number one,...
..you will answer to the name of Dewey.
And little Louie, God bless him, he's...
..he's not with us any more.
Huey,...
..you take one step forward.
That's super.
Now, Dewey, you also
take one step forward.
That's really excellent!
Now...
..you see, what I've done is,
I've reprogrammed both of you...
..so that now you'll respond directly to me.
You'll still run the same maintenance
checks and perform the same duties...
..that you've been doing on the ship,...
..but you'll also be spending much
more time with me in the forest.
And you shouldn't have much of a problem
in making the necessary readjustments.
And I realise that...
..we've really had a rough journey,...
..and we sure got our work cut out for us.
But I think that the three of us,
together, as a team,...
..we can manage OK.
Is that all right with you guys?
The three of us together
are gonna plant a tree.
Trowel, watering can...
..and the tree.
Now, this is the mulch.
That's what makes the tree grow.
Now.
Now, Huey, you're gonna plant the tree...
..and, Dewey, you're gonna dig the ditch.
Now, we're gonna do it right here
on the side of the hill.
That's a real good hole, Dewey.
Now,...
..Huey, here's the tree.
Put a little mulch.
There. OK. Now, plant the tree.
That's pitiful. Pitiful!
That's exactly the opposite
of what it's supposed to be.
What's the matter?
I know you're sad about Louie.
But he got careless! And you see
what happens when you get careless?
OK, now, you guys go on
back to your work.
How are you today?
You bit my hand.
Don't you ever bite my hand again.
You can take a tip from Smokey
That there's nothing like a tree
They're great for kids to climb in
And they're beautiful to see
Huey... and Dewey.
I want you two guys to report
right away to the recreation room.
Well, I see you're already here.
I bet you wonder why I gathered
you here, haven't you?
Well, I wanna beg your indulgence.
I got some new programs here for you.
Now.
Huey, come over and sit down here.
Dewey, you come right up here
and sit down.
You can come a little closer
if you want to, Dewey. Good boy.
That's for you, that's for you...
..and that's for me.
OK, boys.
Now.
I'm about to take you two guys
for every dime you got.
Two, three.
Five, five, five.
Now, boys, let's play cards.
Now, Dewey.
How many cards you want, Dewey?
What are you doin'?
You threw down three kings.
You're nuts, you know that?
Well, your hand is obviously dead,...
..and let's see what you got here.
Well, he's got trash, so obviously
I'm the winner with three sevens.
Thank you, boys. I'm sorry.
You gotta get up in the morning to
beat old Freeman. Early in the morning.
It's all mine. This time we'll play another
hand and I don't want any mistakes.
We're not playing for 3-in-1 oil here.
We're playing for money.
OK. Now, Dewey, you took two.
No, I wasn't looking.
What have I said about talking
between you guys? That's not fair.
I'm all by myself and you're
talkin' between yourselves.
That's a house rule. No more talking.
Now, how many cards d'you want?
You don't want any cards? You just
saw what the man did last hand.
All right. Dealer's taking two.
All right, Huey.
What have you got?
The man had a full house and he knew it!
Now, how about that?
The man had a full house and he knew it.
Huey and Dewey beat me
at my own card game!
I know. I've actually been eating that crap.
Now let's go to the forest
and get some real food.
What has happened to the forest?
Huey, go get me the grey book.
I don't know.
I just cannot figure out what's wrong.
OK, now, listen to me. I want you to
make a slow, complete, 360º turn for me.
Now, hold it. Stop right there.
That's good. Now take a sample there.
Oh, no.
We're coming to the dome.
Wait right there, Huey.
Huey, I thought I told you
to stay in the forest?
You're braced. You can't fall back.
It's OK, Huey. I got it, I got it.
That'll make you rest a little easier now.
Your little light.
No, no, I know where it is.
No, it's OK, Huey.
Just hold steady now.
You won't get that again.
There.
Now, that should be better.
Dewey, go get me
that L-arm circuit wrench.
I understand.
I think I can manage here without it.
There.
I'm screwin' you in tight.
I'm sorry, Huey,...
..but that's the best that I can do.
I tried, but that... that's all
I can do for him, Dewey.
I don't know, Huey. It's just not working.
The forest is dying.
I have tried...
..everything.
And I just don't know what the hell it is.
Come in, Valley Forge. This is
Berkshire to Valley Forge. Do you read me?
Valley Forge. Come in, Valley Forge.
This is Berkshire. Can you read?
We got a plot on you, Lowell. Fantastic!
We 're looking forward to seeing you,
buddy. You made it!
Transmit, will ya?
Please acknowledge immediately.
Come in, Valley Forge. Can you read?
Please transmit immediately.
Berkshire to Valley Forge.
How about a word, Lowell?
Lowell?
I'm mighty glad to see ya, boy.
- Who is this?
- This is Anderson, Lowell.
My God, we've looked
high and low for you.
How did you find me?
Why did you even try?
You must be kidding. We couldn't let
you go without at least trying to find you.
We said we'd send out a search party.
I guess I forgot.
It wasn't easy finding you either,
even with our deep-space tracking.
- I don't suppose it was.
- Freeman,...
..you'll have to find some way
to jettison the dome.
And it's awfully dark out here,
so it'll be safer ifyou don't blow it up.
The sun.
The sun! That's what it is.
- Did you hear what he said? It's the sun!
- What?
Nothing. I was just saying
that everything is all right.
Where was your big explosion?
We can't see it.
The explosion's on
the other side of the ship.
Other side? OK. We'll be docking
on your port side in about six hours.
Right, six hours.
Huey, Dewey, come on.
We can still save the forest.
It's gonna work.
Dewey,...
..I've taught you everything that I know
about taking care of the forest here.
And...
..that's all that
you have to do from now on,...
..is just maintain the forest.
Now, these lights here'll do
the job that the sun would do.
They'll help revive everything.
I just can't do it any more.
You see, things...
..things just haven't worked out for me.
Take care of yourself, Dewey.
Huey, you have to come with me...
..because you're just not working
well enough to help Dewey.
Berkshire to Valley Forge.
We'll be docking on your port side
in two hours. Stand by for updates.
Take good care
of the forest, Dewey.
You know, when I was a kid,...
..I put a note into a bottle...
..and it had my name and address on it.
And then I threw the bottle
into the ocean.
And I never knew if anybody ever found it.
