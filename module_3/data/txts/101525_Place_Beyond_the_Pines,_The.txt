At that point, I knew that I had to
make entry, and I kicked the door down.

Correct.
And you knew that because...
What do you mean?
You just assumed that
the door was locked?
How did I know it was locked?
Yeah.
Is that a trick question?
No. No. I'm just wondering
why you didn't turn the thing.
That's how I knew
it was locked.
Did you tell me that?
No.

tell me what happened.

I only want you to tell me what
you saw and what you remember.

Yes. Yes.

You're Jason's parents?
Yes.
Jason, you've been charged
with criminal possession
of a controlled substance
in the third degree.
Counselor, do you waive a
formal reading of the charges?
<font color="#808080">LAWYER:</font> Yes, please, Your Honor.
In regards
to my client's status,
there has been a discussion
with the District Attorney.
Your Honor, I may be able to have
this case potentially resolved today.
So I'd ask that the court
put it on for second call.
<font color="#808080">JUDGE:</font> Second call.
<font color="#808080">LAWYER:</font> This is a C felony,
so Jason could do anywhere
between five and 15 years.
But I'm getting the impression
from the prosecutor
that they may be willing to
reduce it today to a misdemeanor.
The offer on his particular
case would be time served,
which is the day
he spent in jail,
and a fine,
and that would be it.
Can he come home with us today?
He can.
