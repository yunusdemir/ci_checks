<i>The coffin...</i>
<i>it has your initials, J.B.</i>
<i>At this moment,
rather him than me.</i>
<i>At least you've been saved
the effort of removing him.</i>
<i>Colonel Bouvar passed away
in his sleep, so they tell me.</i>
<i>You sound disappointed
you did not kill him yourself.</i>
<i>I am. Jacques Bouvar murdered
two of my colleagues.</i>
<i>Is there anything else our
French station can do for Monsiuer Bond?</i>
<i>Later, perhaps.</i>
<i>As I said, later. Come on.</i>
<i>Madame...</i>
<i>I've come to offer
my sincere condolences.</i>
<i>My dear Colonel Bouvar...</i>
<i>I don't think you should have
opened that car door by yourself.</i>
<i>No well-dressed man
should be without one.</i>
<i>Yes, very practical.</i>
<i>Get inside.</i>
<i>- They're coming to get me.
- Hurry!</i>
<i>He always runs</i>
<i>While others walk</i>
<i>He acts</i>
<i>While other men just talk</i>
<i>He looks at this world</i>
<i>And wants it all</i>
<i>So he strikes</i>
<i>Like Thunderball</i>
<i>He knows the meaning</i>
<i>Of success</i>
<i>His needs are more</i>
<i>So he gives less</i>
<i>They call him</i>
<i>The winner who takes all</i>
<i>And he strikes</i>
<i>Like Thunderball</i>
<i>Any woman he wants</i>
<i>He'll get</i>
<i>He will break any heart</i>
<i>Without regret</i>
<i>His days of asking</i>
<i>Are all gone</i>
<i>His fight goes on</i>
<i>And on and on</i>
<i>But he thinks that the fight</i>
<i>Is worth it all</i>
<i>So he strikes</i>
<i>Like Thunderball</i>
<i>Hey, no parking here!</i>
<i>Pardon, Monsieur Largo.</i>
<i>The International Brotherhood for
the Assistance of Stateless Persons...</i>
<i>is purely philanthropic.</i>
<i>We're not interested in politics...</i>
<i>only in your rehabilitation.</i>
<i>We have been able to arrange for
visas at the Brazilian Consulate.</i>
<i>The Brotherhood
will look after you until...</i>
<i>- Good morning, Mr. Largo.
- Good morning.</i>
<i>- Nice to have you back again.
- Thank you, my dear.</i>
<i>- We pay back everything!
- There will be no need.</i>
<i>We have certain funds from
private individuals who share our aim.</i>
<i>Sit down, Number Two.
We will discuss...</i>
<i>your NATO project later.</i>
<i>I regret to inform you all
of the death of Spectre Number Six.</i>
<i>Colonel Jacques Bouvar was killed
by an unknown assassin.</i>
<i>His services will be greatly missed.</i>
<i>We will now proceed with the area
financial reports. Number Seven.</i>
<i>Blackmail of the double agent
Matsou Fujiwa.</i>
<i>Unfortunately, only 40 million yen.</i>
<i>- All the man had.
- Number Ten.</i>
<i>Assassination of Perringe,
the French antimatter specialist...</i>
<i>who went over to the Russians.</i>
<i>Three million francs
from the special department...</i>
<i>- of the Quai D'Orsay.
- Number Five.</i>
<i>Our consultation fee for the
British train robbery: 250,000 pounds.</i>
<i>Number 11.</i>
<i>Distribution of Red China narcotics
in the United States...</i>
<i>2,300,000 dollars, collected by
Number Nine and myself.</i>
<i>Two million three...</i>
<i>Our expectations were considerably
higher, Number 11.</i>
<i>Competition from Latin America.
Prices are down.</i>
<i>I anticipated that factor.</i>
<i>Are you quite sure all monies...</i>
<i>have been accounted for
by yourself and Number Nine?</i>
<i>- To the penny, Number One.
- On the contrary...</i>
<i>I have satisfied myself that
one of you is clearly...</i>
<i>guilty of embezzlement.</i>
<i>Spectre is a dedicated fraternity...</i>
<i>whose strength lies in
the absolute integrity of its members.</i>
<i>The culprit is known to me.</i>
<i>I have decided
on the appropriate action.</i>
<i>Let us now proceed with new business.</i>
<i>We will hear from Number Two,
who's in charge of our NATO project...</i>
<i>the most ambitious Spectre
has ever undertaken.</i>
<i>Your report, Number Two.</i>
<i>Thank you, Number One.</i>
<i>Our intention
is to demand a ransom...</i>
<i>from the
North Atlantic Treaty Powers...</i>
<i>of 280 million dollars...</i>
<i>100 million pounds.</i>
<i>I have sent Spectre agent Count Lippe
to the south of England...</i>
<i>where he is making
the necessary preparations.</i>
<i>He is at a health clinic...</i>
<i>conveniently located
near the NATO air base.</i>
<i>- Oh, Pat?
- Hello.</i>
<i>- I'll see you when I've had a shower.
- I'll soon be finished.</i>
<i>- Mr. Bond, Count Lippe.
- You're not taking her away already?</i>
<i>She's the only joy
in this dreary place.</i>
<i>I see you've discovered that too.</i>
<i>- About half an hour, Pat.
- I'll be ready.</i>
<i>I've heard that before.</i>
<i>Nice to have met you, Mr. Bond.</i>
<i>Funny looking bruise. A fall?</i>
<i>A poker in the hands of a widow.</i>
<i>I'm surprised. I'd have thought
you were just the type for a widow.</i>
<i>Not this one.
He didn't like me at all.</i>
<i>A red square
with a spike through it.</i>
<i>I think it's a Tong sign,
the red dragon from Macao.</i>
<i>- Ask records to verify it for me.
- Sorry, sweetie. You're off duty.</i>
<i>- File it till you get back.
- Moneypenny...</i>
<i>next time I see you,
I'll put you across my knee.</i>
<i>On yogurt and lemon juice?
I can hardly wait.</i>
<i>Come on, Pat.</i>
<i>I'm coming.</i>
<i>I can't hear you. Have you fainted?</i>
<i>You're late, Mr. Bond.</i>
<i>Me?</i>
<i>I'd never have recognized myself.</i>
<i>- Do I seem healthy?
- Too healthy. Take off your bathrobe.</i>
<i>You never say that
as if you meant it.</i>
<i>Arms above your head, please.</i>
<i>Behave yourself, Mr. Bond!</i>
<i>I can see there's only
one place to keep you quiet.</i>
<i>What's this?</i>
<i>A motorized traction table
for stretching the spine.</i>
<i>Some patients call it the rack.</i>
<i>I'm not surprised.</i>
<i>Get on.</i>
<i>Where's the kick starter?</i>
<i>Stop fooling around
and face down, please.</i>
<i>Face down.</i>
<i>By the way, who is the man
in the room next to your Count Lippe?</i>
<i>I really don't know
too much about him.</i>
<i>A Mr. Angelo.</i>
<i>He's here with a private physician,
recuperating from an awful car crash.</i>
<i>There, now, the first time
I've felt really safe all day.</i>
<i>I'll look in and see
how you're doing in 15 minutes.</i>
<i>Nice to have met you.</i>
<i>Hey, come back!</i>
<i>Help!</i>
<i>Oh, thank God!</i>
<i>You could've been killed!</i>
<i>I must be six inches taller.</i>
<i>You poor dear.</i>
<i>I can't think how
it could have happened.</i>
<i>I can tell you, it's a miracle
I came back when I did.</i>
<i>I can only think that you must have
pushed the switch accidentally.</i>
<i>You better come along with me.</i>
<i>Spend a few minutes in the steam room.
It'll help to relax you.</i>
<i>- Yes.
- Might even shrink you back to size.</i>
<i>Somebody's going to wish
today had never happened.</i>
<i>You wouldn't tell Dr. Wain.</i>
<i>Please, I'd lose my job.</i>
<i>Well, I suppose my silence
could have a price.</i>
<i>You don't mean... Oh, no.</i>
<i>Oh, yes.</i>
<i>See you later, irrigator.</i>
<i>- What the hell are you doing?
- Don't you worry. I'll tell the chef.</i>
<i>Let me out of this bloody machine!</i>
<i>Help!</i>
<i>Mink.</i>
<i>It reduces the tensions.</i>
<i>Not mine.</i>
<i>Major Derval's social secretary.</i>
<i>- I would like to speak to Mr. Angelo.
- What's that?</i>
<i>- Mr. Angelo.
- I'm sorry.</i>
<i>You got the wrong number.</i>
<i>You don't think you could be
more comfortable if you take off this...</i>
<i>- Yes?
- Major Derval?</i>
<i>- This is Major Derval.
- Your car is waiting.</i>
<i>I'll be down right away. Thank you.</i>
<i>My car's here. Duty calls.
The story of my life.</i>
<i>You'll be late at the air base.</i>
<i>Besides, it will give you
time to cool off.</i>
<i>You'll be here when I come back?</i>
<i>But I may not be in the mood then.</i>
<i>- Do you wanna bet?
- You know your Francois.</i>
<i>I know me.</i>
<i>All right.</i>
<i>- I told him I'd be down.
- Your coat, sir.</i>
<i>Happy landing!</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Be good, at least until I get back.</i>
<i>- Nobody saw us. The corridor's empty.
- Shut the door!</i>
<i>He's dead all right.
Lippe, you take over.</i>
<i>- Are the doctor and ambulance outside?
- Everything as arranged.</i>
<i>Angelo.</i>
<i>Your breathing equipment.</i>
<i>Isolates you from the oxygen supply.</i>
<i>Gamma gas. Instantaneous.
Type you just used. And most important...</i>
<i>Not enough.
100,000 dollars is not enough.</i>
<i>- What are you trying to say?
- I changed my mind.</i>
<i>Two years of my life...</i>
<i>studying the film, the reports...</i>
<i>plastic operations, voice lessons.</i>
<i>Make it a quarter of a million,
or get someone else.</i>
<i>- There is no one else.
- Exactly. I am Derval.</i>
<i>Put that away. Angelo is right.</i>
<i>I'll inform Number One
we made a new arrangement.</i>
<i>This is merely a down payment.</i>
<i>All right, but against
a quarter of a million.</i>
<i>- Agreed.
- His watch.</i>
<i>Identification Disc.</i>
<i>- Au revoir!
- No, he always says ciao.</i>
<i>The cap's too far back on your head.</i>
<i>The rest of my money,
just have it ready.</i>
<i>Come on. Get him into his pajamas.</i>
<i>Sir, identity, please.</i>
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>
<i>This is a normal training sortie,
and you'll be accompanied...</i>
<i>by a NATO representative,
Commandant Derval...</i>
<i>Major Derval of NATO.</i>
<i>It's a routine flight.
You'll be flying a Vulcan...</i>
<i>at an altitude of 45,000 feet...</i>
<i>armed with two atomic bombs,
M.O.S. Type.</i>
<i>Fuses as usual
in the white security box.</i>
<i>Oh, those damned aeroplanes!</i>
<i>They're enough to drive you mad.</i>
<i>Unless, of course,
it's that mink glove of yours.</i>
<i>I'll shut out the noise.</i>
<i>James, where are you going?</i>
<i>Nowhere. I thought
I'd take a little exercise.</i>
<i>You must be joking.</i>
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>Quiet!</i>
<i>Can I help you?
County Police here.</i>
<i>Hello?</i>
<i>- What's going on?
- I don't know.</i>
<i>Could it be the front doorbell?</i>
<i>- It most certainly could not.
- Hello.</i>
<i>Haven't you had enough exercise
for one evening?</i>
<i>It's funny you should say that.</i>
<i>Point of return...</i>
<i>45 minutes, 30 seconds.</i>
<i>Switch from manual to auto.</i>
<i>It's set on automatic. Commandant...</i>
<i>would you care to change places
with the copilot?</i>
<i>- Better view up here.
- I'd be delighted.</i>
<i>This is Southern Radar.</i>
<i>You are now under
positive radar control.</i>
<i>This is avoiding action.</i>
<i>Request you report your position.</i>
<i>Take this, will you?
What's the flap, Dawson?</i>
<i>O-B-N-R, sir. NATO training flight.
Air traffic flashed us.</i>
<i>They lost it on radar. We haven't
been able to pick it up anywhere.</i>
<i>Was she losing altitude
when she went off the screen?</i>
<i>Rapidly.
We can't scan below 300 feet.</i>
<i>- She may have gone down.
- Was she in trouble?</i>
<i>Not according to the last report,
which came from about here.</i>
<i>- She is armed, isn't she?
- Two atomic weapons, M.O.S. Type.</i>
<i>Get everything you can into the area.
A thorough search.</i>
<i>Notify the Admiralty at once.
Top priority. Absolute security.</i>
<i>- Ask them to contact Washington.
- Very good, sir.</i>
<i>Is there anything else in sight?</i>
<i>No. All clear.</i>
<i>Switch on
the underwater landing lights.</i>
<i>Open the underwater hatch.</i>
<i>- Stand by to winch in the submarine.
- Man the winches!</i>
<i>- Give these bomb fuses to Mr. Kutze.
- Right, sir.</i>
<i>Get the submarine up quickly and
the bombs loaded in the containers.</i>
<i>Kutze, are you pleased
with your new toys?</i>
<i>Some new safety device.
A secret control.</i>
<i>What can they have that the great
Ladislav Kutze cannot handle?</i>
<i>Life was much simpler
in my Warsaw laboratory.</i>
<i>Your share will amount to
how many Nobel Prizes?</i>
<i>Pull forward!</i>
<i>More. Hold it!</i>
<i>Paris, sir.
Number One on the scrambler.</i>
<i>Number Two speaking.
Phase two completed.</i>
<i>Number Two has done well,
unlike Count Lippe...</i>
<i>whose choice of Angelo might have
jeopardized the success of our project.</i>
<i>Send a message to the Execution Branch.</i>
<i>You will write,
or telephone at the least.</i>
<i>Day by day. I'm truly sorry
I have to dash off like this.</i>
<i>There's been a bit
of a flap at the office.</i>
<i>- What kind of work do you do?
- I travel...</i>
<i>sort of a licensed troubleshooter.</i>
<i>Mr. Angelo. Heart attack last night.</i>
<i>I'm not surprised.</i>
<i>- Keep in touch.
- Anytime, James. Anyplace.</i>
<i>Another time, another place.</i>
<i>- You are late!
- Yes.</i>
<i>Some people on the road
really burn you up these days.</i>
<i>In the conference room.
Something pretty big.</i>
<i>Every Double-0 man in Europe has been
rushed in, and the Home Secretary too.</i>
<i>His wife's probably lost her dog.</i>
<i>Well, now that we're all here...</i>
<i>The Prime Minister
has asked the Home Secretary...</i>
<i>to come and represent him here today.</i>
<i>The Home Secretary.</i>
<i>Gentlemen, the tape
that you are about to hear...</i>
<i>was received at 10 Downing Street
this morning.</i>
<i>My dear Prime Minister.</i>
<i>Two atomic bombs...</i>
<i>numbers 4-5-6 and 4-5-7...</i>
<i>which were aboard NATO flight 7-5-9...</i>
<i>are now in the possession of Spectre.</i>
<i>Unless within the next seven days
your government...</i>
<i>pays to us
100 million pounds sterling...</i>
<i>in a manner to be designated by us...</i>
<i>we shall destroy
a major city in England...</i>
<i>or the United States of America.</i>
<i>Please signal your acceptance
of our terms by arranging...</i>
<i>for Big Ben to strike seven times...</i>
<i>at 6:00 p. m. Tomorrow.</i>
<i>The Prime Minister and the President...</i>
<i>have talked together
over the hot line and have agreed...</i>
<i>that unless the bombs are recovered,
payment will have to be made.</i>
<i>To avoid general panic...</i>
<i>complete secrecy will be maintained
and no press announcements.</i>
<i>The Prime Minister has asked
that your department...</i>
<i>take charge of the operation.</i>
<i>Thank you. Sir John.</i>
<i>This circle represents
the full flying range of the Vulcan.</i>
<i>Extensive search has failed to locate
any evidence of either a crash...</i>
<i>or landing, and worldwide reports
have proved negative...</i>
<i>on all airfields large enough
to handle the Vulcan.</i>
<i>- That's all we have, sir.
- Thank you, Sir John.</i>
<i>I'll leave you to carry on.
We'll keep you in touch from Number 10.</i>
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>
<i>You may now open the folders
in front of you.</i>
<i>Code name: Thunderball.</i>
<i>As you can see,
we've very little to go on.</i>
<i>All the members of the crew...</i>
<i>had top security clearance.</i>
<i>You'll find their photographs
and service records in your files.</i>
<i>You'll be working with NATO, C.I. A...</i>
<i>and all allied intelligence units.</i>
<i>That's all...</i>
<i>until you discuss your
individual assignments with me.</i>
<i>I've assigned you
to station C, Canada.</i>
<i>Group Captain Pritchard here
will be your Air Force liaison.</i>
<i>Sir, I respectfully suggest that
you change my assignment to Nassau.</i>
<i>Is there any other reason besides
your enthusiasm of water sports?</i>
<i>Perhaps this, sir.</i>
<i>- Well?
- There was a photograph of that man...</i>
<i>in this dossier you gave us.</i>
<i>His name is Derval.</i>
<i>I saw him last night at Shrublands,
but he was dead.</i>
<i>Oh, no, sir. Not possible.
He was seen...</i>
<i>boarding the Vulcan
and took off last night.</i>
<i>If 007 says he saw Derval
last night and he was dead...</i>
<i>that's enough for me
to initiate inquiries.</i>
<i>Yes, of course.</i>
<i>- Who is this girl?
- Derval's sister.</i>
<i>- Do you know where she is now?
- Nassau.</i>
<i>Do you think she's worth going after?</i>
<i>I wouldn't put it quite that way.</i>
<i>We've only got four days.</i>
<i>Don't spend your time sitting around.</i>
<i>No, sir, I won't.</i>
<i>Good luck.</i>
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>
<i>Smashing figure.
I don't suppose...</i>
<i>that has anything to do
with your request?</i>
<i>Was there ever a man
more misunderstood?</i>
<i>You can't pull the wool over my eyes.</i>
<i>You may be able to con the old man,
but I know better. I could...</i>
<i>So do I, Miss Moneypenny.</i>
<i>And I'll thank you not to refer to me
as the old man.</i>
<i>I think I had a hat when I came in.</i>
<i>How else will you recognize her?</i>
<i>Couldn't miss.
She has two moles on the left thigh.</i>
<i>- Thank you, Mr...
- James Bond.</i>
<i>I arrived soon after you went down.</i>
<i>- I've been admiring your form.
- Have you?</i>
<i>Your name's James Bond
and you've been admiring my form.</i>
<i>Most girls just paddle around.</i>
<i>- You swim like a man.
- So do you.</i>
<i>I've had quite a bit of practice.</i>
<i>- Do you come here often?
- Whenever I'm bored.</i>
<i>Practically every day.</i>
<i>What else do you do, and where?</i>
<i>- You don't waste time, do you?
- No.</i>
<i>- For effort.
- Thank you.</i>
<i>I'll wear it so you know me next time.</i>
<i>I was right. Couldn't miss.</i>
<i>- I'm not with you.
- You soon will be.</i>
<i>Paula!</i>
<i>- Give me a hand, will you?
- Get in.</i>
<i>Tell London I've made contact
with the girl.</i>
<i>Well, it's not what I'd call contact.</i>
<i>I'll pass it through
you've seen the girl.</i>
<i>- Keep trying.
- It won't start!</i>
<i>Ahoy there! Our motor's conked out.</i>
<i>You wouldn't be going anywhere
near Coral Harbor, would you?</i>
<i>I wasn't, but I could.</i>
<i>I have a very important appointment.
I'd appreciate a lift.</i>
<i>Come aboard then!</i>
<i>You don't mind taking
the service boat, do you?</i>
<i>Not at all.</i>
<i>Hurry up!</i>
<i>- Perhaps lunch by the pool.
- How about your urgent appointment?</i>
<i>How long have you been out here?</i>
<i>About three weeks.</i>
<i>Don't you ever stop asking questions?</i>
<i>All right. Change of tack.
Have some of my conch chowder.</i>
<i>You've been reading
the wrong books, Mr. Bond.</i>
<i>- About conch chowder?
- Being an aphrodisiac.</i>
<i>It just so happens that
I like conch chowder.</i>
<i>Friend of yours?</i>
<i>- Works for my guardian.
- Your guardian has you watched?</i>
<i>- He likes to know where I am.
- I don't blame him.</i>
<i>- Will you excuse me?
- You're not going so soon?</i>
<i>I'm afraid so.</i>
<i>My guardian's yacht.</i>
<i>Oh, really?</i>
<i>- He'll be expecting me.
- May I come with you?</i>
<i>- I'd love to meet your guardian.
- Oh, no.</i>
<i>- Will I see you again?
- It's a small island.</i>
<i>- Perhaps we can have dinner together.
- No.</i>
<i>- My dear, uncooperative Domino.
- How do you know that?</i>
<i>How do you know
my friends call me Domino?</i>
<i>It's on the bracelet on your ankle.</i>
<i>What sharp little eyes you've got.</i>
<i>Wait till you get to my teeth.</i>
<i>Bye then.
See you tomorrow on the beach.</i>
<i>- 500 pounds, please.
- Certainly, monsieur.</i>
<i>Thanks.</i>
<i>Sorry.</i>
<i>- There.
- Thank you.</i>
<i>Two hundred.</i>
<i>Eight.</i>
<i>Someone has to lose.</i>
<i>Yes, I thought I saw
a spectre at your shoulder.</i>
<i>What do you mean?</i>
<i>The spectre of defeat.
Your luck was due to change.</i>
<i>We'll soon find out.</i>
<i>Any objection to raise the limit?
500 pounds shall we say?</i>
<i>- Too big for me.
- Count me out too.</i>
<i>Perhaps you would like
to take the shoe.</i>
<i>My friend won't mind, Mr...</i>
<i>- Bond.
- Oh, yes. Mr. Bond.</i>
<i>- One of my associates spoke about you.
- Nothing bad, I hope.</i>
<i>It's your spectre against mine.</i>
<i>You wish to put the evil eye on me?</i>
<i>We have a way to deal with that
where I come from.</i>
<i>You may hex me.
Let's see what it does for the cards.</i>
<i>- No.
- Seven.</i>
<i>Six.</i>
<i>Eight.</i>
<i>Nine.</i>
<i>You seem to be unbeatable, Mr. Bond.</i>
<i>For the moment.
This sort of thing can't last.</i>
<i>Emilio, you promised
to buy me a drink.</i>
<i>Soon, my dear.
I want to get my money back first.</i>
<i>May I be allowed
to buy the lady a drink?</i>
<i>- I would appreciate that.
- Then I must pass the shoe.</i>
<i>He's going to be impossible
if his luck doesn't change.</i>
<i>Somehow, I don't think it will tonight.</i>
<i>Beluga caviar, Dom Perignon, '55.</i>
<i>- Monsieur.
- Thank you.</i>
<i>I understand you're Mr. Largo's niece.</i>
<i>Sounds better than... What would you say?
Mistress? Kept woman?</i>
<i>I wouldn't say that.
Where did you meet him?</i>
<i>In Capri. I was there
with my brother, Francois.</i>
<i>Strange. I found Emilio attractive...</i>
<i>then.</i>
<i>- Does he live aboard the yacht?
- No. He has a house on the island.</i>
<i>Must we talk about him?
I'd much rather dance.</i>
<i>So would I.</i>
<i>- Where is your brother now?
- In England.</i>
<i>He's a Commandant
with the NATO forces there.</i>
<i>He's a wonderful person.</i>
<i>The trouble is
I never meet anyone like him.</i>
<i>- Only men like Largo and myself.
- You are not like Largo.</i>
<i>No?</i>
<i>Why do you say that?</i>
<i>The way you hold me.</i>
<i>There.</i>
<i>- How long are you staying in Nassau?
- We're going the day after tomorrow.</i>
<i>As I said,
we haven't got much time.</i>
<i>Emilio wants to leave.</i>
<i>Are you sleeping aboard tonight?</i>
<i>I hoped you'd not be so obvious.</i>
<i>Well, when one has so little time,
one sort of has to be obvious.</i>
<i>- You know where you can find me.
- Mr. Bond.</i>
<i>Your niece is an excellent dancer.</i>
<i>Let me prove I'm as good a loser
as you are a winner.</i>
<i>Come to lunch on Sunday.
The Palmyra. It's my house.</i>
<i>Sunday at noon, then.</i>
<i>My dear.</i>
<i>- Good night.
- Good night.</i>
<i>You must tell me what Mr. Bond
had to say, word for word.</i>
<i>He talked about you a little.</i>
<i>What was he saying just then?
I didn't quite hear.</i>
<i>He asked were we
sleeping aboard tonight.</i>
<i>Interesting.</i>
<i>- My key. It's 304, please.
- Thank you. 304.</i>
<i>- I'm sorry, no mail.
- Thank you.</i>
<i>Well, hello, 00...</i>
<i>That's a fine way
to treat the C.I.A.</i>
<i>Sorry about that, Felix,
but you were about to say 007.</i>
<i>Here.</i>
<i>Have you killed him?</i>
<i>You know me better than that.
Here you go, Smiler.</i>
<i>Have you seen everything
you came to see?</i>
<i>Go back to your friends and report.</i>
<i>Tell them, the little fish I throw back
into the sea. Give it to him.</i>
<i>You're going to shoot me in the back.</i>
<i>The gun, I mean.</i>
<i>Get out!</i>
<i>- Who was he?
- Like I said, a small fish...</i>
<i>working for a Mr. Largo.</i>
<i>He's got a yacht
we should take a look at later.</i>
<i>- Quist to see Mr. Largo.
- Open up.</i>
<i>Yes? It's Quist.</i>
<i>Gently, my friend.</i>
<i>- What did you find?
- Nothing.</i>
<i>- You saw Bond?
- Yes, I saw him.</i>
<i>What happened?</i>
<i>You let him get the better of you.</i>
<i>Hey, there,
did you finally make contact?</i>
<i>You're late. Felix Leiter,
this is Pinder, our man here.</i>
<i>- How do you do?
- This way, gentlemen.</i>
<i>- Who's the girl?
- Paula Kaplan, my assistant here.</i>
<i>He has no plans
to visit the United States.</i>
<i>Now here's a special announcement...</i>
<i>from the Overseas Service
of the B.B.C.</i>
<i>Big Ben actually did strike
seven times at 6:00 this evening.</i>
<i>This was caused
by a mechanical failure...</i>
<i>which last occurred during
a violent electrical storm in 1898.</i>
<i>And here once again
are the headlines.</i>
<i>Obviously stalling for time.</i>
<i>- Oh, no!
- Ah, 007.</i>
<i>- What a wonderful surprise.
- For me too.</i>
<i>I must say, I find this business
of equipping you in the field...</i>
<i>on the run, as it were...
highly irregular.</i>
<i>Here we have a Geiger counter.</i>
<i>Useful and unobtrusive.</i>
<i>The sweep hand
takes the radioactivity count.</i>
<i>- It's waterproof, of course.
- But of course.</i>
<i>Now, here's something I want you
to use with special care.</i>
<i>- With special care.
- Everything you give me...</i>
<i>Is treated with equal contempt.
Yes, I know.</i>
<i>But that's an underwater camera.
It takes eight pictures...</i>
<i>in rapid succession
by pressing that button there.</i>
<i>- Is that clever?
- If you can take pictures...</i>
<i>in the dark with an infrared film, yes.</i>
<i>Try to be a little less than
your usual frivolous self, 007.</i>
<i>Here's a miniature Very pistol...</i>
<i>which fires a bright red flare,
a distress signal.</i>
<i>You should keep it on you
day and night.</i>
<i>I resent that remark.</i>
<i>Look, do you mind?</i>
<i>Now, in the event of a re-breather
not being available...</i>
<i>you can use this device
for short periods only, of course.</i>
<i>Say, about four minutes.</i>
<i>- Clever.
- You'll only use it as a last resort.</i>
<i>It closes
to a convenient pocket size.</i>
<i>Assuming one has a convenient pocket.</i>
<i>Now pay attention.
A recently developed...</i>
<i>harmless radioactive device.</i>
<i>Harmless.</i>
<i>It sends out a homing signal
to a special receiver.</i>
<i>- What am I supposed to do with this?
- Obviously, you...</i>
<i>swallow it.</i>
<i>Now?</i>
<i>Let's hope she'll still be lying
in the same place tonight.</i>
<i>We'll use this catamaran
as a rendezvous place for later.</i>
<i>Good idea.</i>
<i>Take her in.</i>
<i>A container will be dropped
off the coast of Burma...</i>
<i>in the Megui Archipelago...</i>
<i>latitude 20 degrees north,
longitude 60 degrees east...</i>
<i>at 20 hundred hours
Greenwich mean time on May 27.</i>
<i>It will hold blue-white
flawless diamonds between...</i>
<i>three and eight carats.</i>
<i>Total value to be not less than
100 million pounds...</i>
<i>present market price.</i>
<i>After we have
recovered the container...</i>
<i>and verified its contents...</i>
<i>you will be notified on
radio frequency 16.23 megacycles...</i>
<i>where the atomic bombs
may be recovered.</i>
<i>Kenniston, you'd better get on
to De Beers at once.</i>
<i>Yes, sir.</i>
<i>Well, gentlemen,
unless those bombs are found...</i>
<i>I'm very much afraid
we'll have to pay their price.</i>
<i>- Sir?
- Oh, yes.</i>
<i>Signal from 007 in Nassau.</i>
<i>One or two things
that might interest us.</i>
<i>The Disco Volante is still in the
harbor, lying off the casino channel.</i>
<i>The catamaran is there too,
so we can use it for cover.</i>
<i>That's fine. You can drop me
in the water behind her.</i>
<i>- Any further news from London?
- No.</i>
<i>Zero hour is still
20 hundred hours on the 27th.</i>
<i>- That's just 55 hours from now.
- Yes. Shall we go?</i>
<i>- Okay, this will do here.
- We'll meet back at Pinder's.</i>
<i>Good luck.</i>
<i>Turn the underwater lights on.</i>
<i>TV, closed-circuit!</i>
<i>Hand grenades.</i>
<i>Ready.</i>
<i>Down there.</i>
<i>There!</i>
<i>Hey, there's something there!</i>
<i>Look! Must have hit him
with the propeller.</i>
<i>Let's get back and tell Largo.</i>
<i>- Can I have a lift?
- Sure.</i>
<i>Thank you.
You just about saved my life.</i>
<i>My outboard capsized,
so I had to swim ashore.</i>
<i>How far do you go?</i>
<i>You better fasten your safety belt.</i>
<i>What's your name?</i>
<i>James Bond.</i>
<i>Fiona Volpe.</i>
<i>- Do you fly here often?
- Do I make you nervous?</i>
<i>No, it's just that
I have no desire...</i>
<i>to be capsized twice in one night.</i>
<i>At least you won't
have to swim ashore.</i>
<i>Have you been here before, Mr. Bond?</i>
<i>No, I haven't.
But this is the road to Nassau?</i>
<i>Yes, eventually.</i>
<i>- Well, this is as far as I go.
- Me too. This is my hotel.</i>
<i>- What a coincidence.
- Yes, so convenient.</i>
<i>You look pale.
I hope I didn't frighten you.</i>
<i>You see, I've always
been a nervous passenger.</i>
<i>Some men just don't like to be driven.</i>
<i>No, some men just don't like
to be taken for a ride.</i>
<i>Look at this.</i>
<i>An underwater hatch.</i>
<i>Yeah. So that's how
they could leave and get back.</i>
<i>Yes, and nobody saw them.
Obviously the whole operation...</i>
<i>was carried out underwater.</i>
<i>That's where we'll have to look
for the plane. Come on.</i>
<i>I'll bring the prints
to the hotel when they're dry.</i>
<i>Don't forget the Air Force searched
the area 250 miles out of Nassau.</i>
<i>It must be beyond that radius.</i>
<i>That's if the Disco Volante
was out that night.</i>
<i>Sure she was, but harbor control
said for only six hours.</i>
<i>She couldn't cover 500 miles
in that time, no.</i>
<i>About 90 miles is her limit for
six hours, and that's out and back.</i>
<i>I reckon we've got to go further out.
We'll need more gas for that.</i>
<i>All right.
Let's get back to Nassau.</i>
<i>- We haven't got much time.
- You're right, we haven't.</i>
<i>Pull!</i>
<i>Of course they are watching us.</i>
<i>What else have they to do?</i>
<i>- You would like Bond dead?
- I can think of no better arrangement.</i>
<i>Because he tries to make love
to your woman?</i>
<i>Because he is Bond, and as an enemy
of Spectre, he should be killed.</i>
<i>Mark!</i>
<i>If Bond had died last night
as a result of your hastiness...</i>
<i>his government would have known
for certain that the bombs are here.</i>
<i>When the time is right,
he will be killed. Pull!</i>
<i>I shall kill him.</i>
<i>A separate pool.
For sharks, no less. Move in.</i>
<i>Hold on that line.</i>
<i>That's Largo's place, all right.
My next port of call.</i>
<i>- Mr. Largo?
- Yes, sir.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>- Can I help?
- Why, Mr. Bond.</i>
<i>- Of course you can.
- That looks particularly inviting.</i>
<i>- Welcome to Palmyra.
- It's a pleasure.</i>
<i>I just hope I'm not
interrupting anything.</i>
<i>- What do you mean?
- I thought you had another visitor.</i>
<i>That gun, it looks
more fitting for a woman.</i>
<i>You know much about guns?</i>
<i>No. I know a little about women.</i>
<i>Mr. Jenni, Mr. Vargas.
Mr. Vargas, Mr. Jenni.</i>
<i>- Which is which?
- I thought you might have met...</i>
<i>Mr. Vargas the other night.</i>
<i>- Yes, I believe I did.
- Drink, sir?</i>
<i>- Rum Collins?
- Yes.</i>
<i>Just about that hour, isn't it?</i>
<i>For you? Of course!</i>
<i>Vargas does not drink,
does not smoke...</i>
<i>does not make love.</i>
<i>What do you do, Vargas?
Every man has his passion.</i>
<i>Mine is fishing.</i>
<i>What is yours, Mr. Bond?</i>
<i>Well, I'm not what you'd call
a passionate man.</i>
<i>I think it's time I went to change.</i>
<i>You must let me show you around.</i>
<i>- I'd love that.
- I thought you might.</i>
<i>Pull!</i>
<i>- What could be easier?
- Perhaps you would call one for me?</i>
<i>- Of course. Pull!
- It seems terribly difficult.</i>
<i>No, it isn't, is it?</i>
<i>I collect big game fish
for various marine institutions.</i>
<i>Magnificent creatures!</i>
<i>Charming.</i>
<i>The notorious Golden Grotto sharks.</i>
<i>The most savage, the most dangerous.</i>
<i>They know when it's time
for them to be fed.</i>
<i>- That boat, is she yours?
- Yes. I'm very proud of her.</i>
<i>What does she do, about 15 knots?</i>
<i>Better than that. Near 20.</i>
<i>- Perhaps you'd like to see over her?
- Yes, I would very much.</i>
<i>- Lunch is ready.
- Thank you, my darling.</i>
<i>Come along, Mr. Bond.
The conch chowder smells delicious.</i>
<i>Domino, I was just thinking.</i>
<i>As I'll be busy this evening,
perhaps Mr. Bond will be kind enough...</i>
<i>to take you to the Jankanoo,
our local Mardi Gras.</i>
<i>You'll be my guest tonight.</i>
<i>- That's very kind of you.
- It will be my pleasure.</i>
<i>Our Mr. Bond must have
a very high opinion of himself.</i>
<i>Opinion?</i>
<i>Yes. He has a date with me too.</i>
<i>Excuse me.</i>
<i>- Let me go!
- Over here.</i>
<i>Don't let her make so much noise.
Use the chloroform.</i>
<i>Largo did promise
he'd come, didn't he?</i>
<i>He'll be here. Don't worry.</i>
<i>I think that man is waving at you.</i>
<i>Come down here.</i>
<i>Quick!</i>
<i>Excuse me for a second.</i>
<i>- James, Paula's gone!
- What do you mean, gone?</i>
<i>She just checked out of the hotel.</i>
<i>You look after Domino. Watch her.</i>
<i>- Do you think she was onto something?
- I don't know, but I gotta find out.</i>
<i>- You watch out for her.
- Right.</i>
<i>All right. Thank you.</i>
<i>The governor's not very happy,
but you'll have...</i>
<i>a power cut as requested
all over the island.</i>
<i>I don't give a damn
about the rest of the island.</i>
<i>- I want the lights out in Palmyra.
- You'll have it.</i>
<i>What do you mean, she won't talk?</i>
<i>Don't worry, she will.</i>
<i>What's wrong?</i>
<i>- Is it a power failure?
- Yes, all over the island.</i>
<i>Switch over
to the emergency generator.</i>
<i>Largo told you to be careful.</i>
<i>I didn't kill her.
She must have taken some poison.</i>
<i>A capsule in the mouth.
What do you think, cyanide?</i>
<i>She's dead.</i>
<i>Ricardo, someone's got him!</i>
<i>Search that way!
And you, the shark pool!</i>
<i>- What happened?
- I don't know.</i>
<i>Leave him! This way!</i>
<i>Stop it!</i>
<i>You fools! He's got
you all shooting at each other!</i>
<i>Over here!</i>
<i>No! I've got a better idea.</i>
<i>Lift the tunnel hatch
and let them eat.</i>
<i>Yes, sir.</i>
<i>Sorry, old chap.
Better luck next time.</i>
<i>Tell Leiter to stay with the girl.
I'll get back to him as soon as I can.</i>
<i>- Anything else?
- Tell him Paula's dead.</i>
<i>Aren't you in the wrong room?</i>
<i>Not from where I'm standing.</i>
<i>Since you're here, would you mind
giving me something to put on?</i>
<i>Anyway, I'm very glad to see you again.</i>
<i>I'm glad to see you again.</i>
<i>I had the feeling
you've been avoiding me.</i>
<i>I had no idea that
we were next-door neighbors.</i>
<i>They just moved me down
this afternoon.</i>
<i>It's extraordinary, isn't it?
Almost as if...</i>
<i>As if it was intended.</i>
<i>Yes, it is extraordinary.</i>
<i>Shouldn't you get out
of those wet clothes?</i>
<i>You'll catch your death of cold.</i>
<i>Look, you know
we're going to be too late.</i>
<i>- Too late for what?
- The Jankanoo.</i>
<i>I promised my friends
I'd meet them there.</i>
<i>Perhaps you know them, the Largos.</i>
<i>Questions. All I get is questions.</i>
<i>But the music is gonna
go on all night anyhow.</i>
<i>Enough to drive you wild.
Do you like wild things?</i>
<i>Wild. You should be
locked up in a cage.</i>
<i>This bed feels like a cage.</i>
<i>All these bars.</i>
<i>Do you think I'll be safe?</i>
<i>You made a shocking mess out of
my hair, you sadistic brute.</i>
<i>Will you zip me up, please?</i>
<i>No wonder you can
get dressed so quickly.</i>
<i>On the way, we can have a little talk.</i>
<i>You may find it interesting. Come on.</i>
<i>I'm coming.</i>
<i>I hate to think
I'm gonna miss anything.</i>
<i>And now we can go somewhere
for an interesting talk.</i>
<i>Friends of yours, no doubt. Come in.</i>
<i>You dress quickly too.
I didn't see that gun in the mirror.</i>
<i>Not that it matters, but that
was under the pillow all the time.</i>
<i>When did you find out?</i>
<i>You're wearing the same ring
as Largo.</i>
<i>- It's a ring I like to wear.
- Then it has its dangers.</i>
<i>Vanity, Mr. Bond.</i>
<i>- It's something you know so much about.
- My dear girl.</i>
<i>Don't flatter yourself. What I did
this evening was for King and Country.</i>
<i>You don't think it gave me
any pleasure, do you?</i>
<i>But of course.
I forgot your ego.</i>
<i>James Bond, who only has
to make love to a woman...</i>
<i>and she starts to hear
heavenly choirs singing.</i>
<i>She repents and immediately returns
to the side of right and virtue.</i>
<i>But not this one.</i>
<i>What a blow it must have been,
you having a failure.</i>
<i>Well, you can't win them all.</i>
<i>We'll take him out the front way.
Go and get the car.</i>
<i>Careful, Mr. Bond.</i>
<i>Now what?</i>
<i>Get through to Palmyra and tell them
we've been held up by the Jankanoo.</i>
<i>- Like to have a drink, man?
- Get him away!</i>
<i>- Don't you try anything now.
- Get out of here!</i>
<i>- It's real firewater.
- Get out of here!</i>
<i>After him! Get him!</i>
<i>You haven't seen anything?</i>
<i>Look!</i>
<i>Follow him. You that side, you there.</i>
<i>Stay with us.</i>
<i>- Thank you, I'd love to.
- Love to what?</i>
<i>- You're mad. Do you know that?
- Yes. Isn't everyone?</i>
<i>May I cut in?</i>
<i>You should have told me
your wife was here.</i>
<i>Do you come here often?</i>
<i>It's no good trying to escape.</i>
<i>I don't want to escape.</i>
<i>Strange as it may seem,
I've grown accustomed to your face.</i>
<i>Why don't you come with us quietly?</i>
<i>You don't seem to understand.
You see, I enjoy my dancing.</i>
<i>Do you mind if my friend
sits this one out? She's just dead.</i>
<i>You'll leave here at 0600 hours
and land at Aden to refuel.</i>
<i>You will then proceed
to the Megui Archipelago...</i>
<i>to make your drop precisely at...</i>
<i>20 degrees north,
60 degrees east.</i>
<i>The diamonds will be
in a special container.</i>
<i>I hate to give in like this.</i>
<i>Paying the blood money,
letting them beat us.</i>
<i>- Have you an alternative suggestion?
- I'm afraid I haven't.</i>
<i>Your man, 007,
I thought he was on to something.</i>
<i>- I thought so too, sir.
- False alarm?</i>
<i>- I'm afraid so.
- He obviously has...</i>
<i>a highly developed sense of,
shall we say, drama?</i>
<i>If 007 thought
he was on to something...</i>
<i>It's a great pity he didn't make sure
before he started to shout the odds.</i>
<i>Well, we have exactly
14 hours and 50 minutes.</i>
<i>Then I suppose we shall have to pay up
and look as happy as we can. Shan't we?</i>
<i>Well, that's it, James.
We've looked about everywhere.</i>
<i>We've got to find that plane.</i>
<i>You won't find it down there.
That's the Golden Grotto.</i>
<i>- Golden Grotto?
- Yeah. All you'll find...</i>
<i>down there are sharks.</i>
<i>Take her down. I want a closer look.</i>
<i>- At what?
- Never mind! Take her down, quick!</i>
<i>Set her down.
I think we've found it.</i>
<i>There's something camouflaged
down there. I'll take a look.</i>
<i>Shoot one of those sharks.
It'll keep the others occupied.</i>
<i>I don't know how long the others
will take before they finish him off...</i>
<i>- but they'll be back.
- I'll keep an eye on them.</i>
<i>Good.</i>
<i>- She's down there, all right.
- Are the bombs on board?</i>
<i>- No.
- Great. What's our next move?</i>
<i>We'll check on the Disco Volante.</i>
<i>If the bombs aren't aboard her now,
they soon will be.</i>
<i>Who are you going to ask, Largo?</i>
<i>No, I don't think we'll have to.</i>
<i>I hope we didn't frighten the fish.</i>
<i>Ow! Sea egg spines.
They're poisonous!</i>
<i>Here, give me your arm.</i>
<i>Sit down.</i>
<i>Now turn over.</i>
<i>This is going to hurt a bit.</i>
<i>It's the first time I've
tasted women. They're rather good.</i>
<i>You're the only man
to ever make me cry.</i>
<i>Except perhaps Francois,
my brother, when we were children.</i>
<i>Domino, I have to tell you something.</i>
<i>I'm sorry, James. I didn't mean
to embarrass you, speaking of love.</i>
<i>- I must hurt you again.
- You're going away?</i>
<i>So sorry, my dear, but it's all over.</i>
<i>No, it's about your brother.</i>
<i>What about him?</i>
<i>He's dead.</i>
<i>What happened?</i>
<i>It's a long story,
and it involves your friend Largo.</i>
<i>I need your help.</i>
<i>Of course.</i>
<i>That's why you made love to me.</i>
<i>Look, I can't explain
what this is all about.</i>
<i>- But you must trust me.
- Because you want me to help you?</i>
<i>Largo had your brother murdered,
or it was on his orders.</i>
<i>Hundreds of thousands of people
will die very soon...</i>
<i>if you don't help me.</i>
<i>That much we do know,
but there's something we don't...</i>
<i>The bombs, when they're being loaded
aboard the Disco Volante.</i>
<i>- How could I know that?
- That you'll have to find out.</i>
<i>It won't be easy.
It could be very dangerous.</i>
<i>What can he do to me
he hasn't already done?</i>
<i>Then you'll do it?</i>
<i>- Yes.
- Good.</i>
<i>This is a Geiger counter.
You press this lever.</i>
<i>If it starts clicking,
it means the bombs are aboard.</i>
<i>- What do I do then?
- Go straight up on deck.</i>
<i>As the Disco Volante is being watched,
you'll be spotted.</i>
<i>Vargas, behind you.</i>
<i>Really?</i>
<i>He must have followed us.</i>
<i>I think he got the point.</i>
<i>It should have been Largo.</i>
<i>Largo? When did he expect you back?</i>
<i>Very soon now. He said not to be late.
He was most insistent.</i>
<i>You better go straight back. I'll take
care of Vargas and everything here.</i>
<i>Understand I'm doing this for
my brother, for what he did to him.</i>
<i>But promise you will kill Largo
for me, whatever happens.</i>
<i>- We haven't much time.
- All right.</i>
<i>Oh, something I remembered.
It may not be important.</i>
<i>- Tell me. Everything's important.
- There's a small bridge over the canal.</i>
<i>Largo never allows strangers
to go near it.</i>
<i>By the canal there's a flight of steps.</i>
<i>- Where do they lead to?
- Down into the sea...</i>
<i>on the far side of Palmyra.</i>
<i>Perhaps it is important after all.</i>
<i>Put on your equipment.</i>
<i>Did we get a message saying the girl
went on board the Disco?</i>
<i>Yes, sir. Signal received at...</i>
<i>- If she is on board, where is 007 now?
- That's the question.</i>
<i>Stand by. Five seconds.</i>
<i>Watch my signal.</i>
<i>- Prepare to get underway.
- Aye, aye, sir.</i>
<i>Captain, weigh anchor.</i>
<i>Get underway immediately.</i>
<i>Once we pick up the merchandise,
head for our target area, Miami.</i>
<i>The Disco Volante's leaving, sir.</i>
<i>- I told you to stay in your cabin.
- It's stuffy in there.</i>
<i>- I want a breath of air.
- My dear, did you not hear me?</i>
<i>- Where did you get that?
- I bought it this morning.</i>
<i>- Let me see.
- No. Why should I?</i>
<i>Mr. Bond gave you this little toy,
I imagine, and Vargas is dead.</i>
<i>No, my dear.
There is no escape for you.</i>
<i>Like your friend,
you've been a little too clever.</i>
<i>And now you are caught!</i>
<i>You have given me
much pleasure, Domino.</i>
<i>But in return, unless you tell me
how much Bond knows...</i>
<i>I'll be forced to cause you great pain.</i>
<i>This for heat, these for cold.</i>
<i>Applied scientifically and slowly.</i>
<i>Very, very slowly.</i>
<i>- What do you want?
- We're activating the bombs.</i>
<i>- You said you wanted to be told.
- Oh, yes.</i>
<i>A private little matter between
the young woman and myself.</i>
<i>Go!</i>
<i>Do not live in hope, my dear.
There is no one to rescue you.</i>
<i>Now go on!</i>
<i>It's a good thing
the homing capsule he swallowed...</i>
<i>is still working.</i>
<i>Straight ahead.</i>
<i>Go right.</i>
<i>That's him!</i>
<i>Hold it!</i>
<i>Up.</i>
<i>Get your radio man
on to Orlando Beach.</i>
<i>Warn them the target is Miami.</i>
<i>Also, the bomb is transferred
from the Disco Volante...</i>
<i>onto a wreck off Fowley Point.</i>
<i>Right. Hang on to that.</i>
<i>And the kitchen sink.</i>
<i>On you, everything looks good.</i>
<i>Take this.</i>
<i>Good luck.</i>
<i>- Weigh anchor!
- Aye, aye, sir.</i>
<i>- Make smoke.
- Making smoke now.</i>
<i>- Stand by for conversion.
- Standing by.</i>
<i>Jettison cocoon.</i>
<i>Cocoon's away.</i>
<i>Keep firing! They're closing!</i>
<i>Fire more, more!</i>
<i>Wait a minute.</i>
<i>We've still got one bomb aboard.</i>
<i>He's gone mad!
Please talk to them for me.</i>
<i>Tell them that I only did what
I had to do, what I was told to do.</i>
<i>- Where is he?
- The bomb cannot be exploded now.</i>
<i>I threw the arming device
into the sea.</i>
<i>- Do you understand?
- Yes.</i>
<i>Get him!</i>
<i>- I'm glad I killed him.
- You're glad?</i>
<i>- Who's he?
- I don't know, but he helped me.</i>
<i>- Look out! The rocks!
- The reef!</i>
<i>He's jammed the controls!
Come on!</i>
<i>- Come on, now, jump!
- I never learned to swim!</i>
<i>Never too late to learn.</i>
<i>Get down!</i>
<i>Up.</i>
