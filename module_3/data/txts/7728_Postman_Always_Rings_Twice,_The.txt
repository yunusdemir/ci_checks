Good meeting with you.

- He's checking the hookup.
- Hurry. I want to see lights on.
Come on!
Where the hell is it?
Go around there.
He said it's around to the left.
Yeah, I think I found it.
He would have found us anyway.
You don't know him.
He would have followed us
and found us.
It was no sleepover, Cora.
I'm just disappointed.
I thought we had something.
You just don't know
what it's like.
Be a woman trapped
in this kind of--
You don't know.
There's always a way, Cora...
...if we stick together.
I didn't know what to do.
Cora?
Cora.
I gotta have you, Frank.
If it was just us...
If it was just you and me...
What are you talking about?
I'm tired of what's
right and wrong.
They hang people for that, Cora.
Cora!
Cora!
How many times I gotta call you?
Come here.
Hey, come here.
Hey, Frank, it look good from here.
Yeah, it's a hell
of an idea you had.
Yeah, ha, ha.
Neon, huh? Neon!
All right?
I'll honk the horn.
Twice for danger.
And the door?
Locked from the inside.
- Then down the ladder and that's it.
- Yeah.
Do you love me, Frank?
Sure.
You know I do.
Don't worry about anything.
Don't tell me that.
Evening.
You knew I had to stop
here, didn't you.
She's beautiful.
I come by here all the time.
When'd you put her up?
Uh, just today.
That had to be.
What's that?
There's a damn cat up there.
Oh, yeah. Ha, ha.
Hey, they sound a lot like
babies crying sometimes, don't they?
Yes, they do.
Well, I ought to get back to work.
Yeah, well. We all got to sometime,
that's for sure.
That's for sure.
- Take care now.
- Okay, I'll do that.
Aah! Frank!
Frank, get over here!
Oh, my God!
Frank!
What happened to the lights?
- I hit him. I hit him!
- Huh?
I hit him, and all
the lights went out!
Call an ambulance.
The cop came by. He saw everything.
The cop? What cop?
Get on the phone!
Get on the phone!
I'm gonna die for this!
I know I am!
Hello, Nick.
Ugh. Nick, wake up. Nick.
Come on, Nick.
Come on, Nick! Wake up!
Come on, Nick! Come on, Nick!
Nick, wake up! God.
We'll know for sure
after we see the tests.
It'll be about a week.
Only a week.
Thank you.
Can I have the book, please?
Thanks.
All he knows, it went dark.
If he'd have turned around,
they'd have hanged us for it.
And something...
Something put that cop there.
It's an act of God
those lights went out.
Don't look back.
- What?
- Don't look back. It's a cop.
His red light's on.
Oh, God.
No, no, leave them on.
Bathroom upstairs?
Uh, yeah.
What's that ladder doing there?
I don't know.
Come here.
All right, sure.
Hey.
Cover's off this fuse box up here.
That sucker stuck a paw in it,
fried him deader than hell.
Yeah, how about that?
It must have been those guys that,
uh, were working on the sign today.
Well...
Well, sounds like that.
Sorry about your husband,
ma'am.
Thank you.
Thanks a lot.
I'll, uh, get a flashlight.
I know it's tough...
...to go down and see him.
You're sure you don't
want me to drive?
Hurry back.
Riders, to the right!
Take it easy, guys,
there's enough for everyone.
Cut pie.
Little portions.
Happy to help you.
John Philip Sousa.
I don't want to make love tonight.
It's our last night.
I know.
I don't want to make love.
You're right.
Me neither.
Oh, Christ, Cora.
It's all in the feet.
You must watch the feet.
Can I talk to you?
- Just watch the feet...
- Can I talk to you?
...how I dance and you'll learn--
Excuse me.
I can't talk about it now.
What do you mean
you can't talk about it?
Four days already,
you can't talk about it.
Yeah, you don't understand.
I can't do it anymore, Frank.
You understand?
What can't you do?
What does that mean?
You can't do it anymore?
- It's over.
- Cora, come dance.
What? What are you talking about?
Bravo, Nicko!
Frank, come here!
This man save my life.
I found this man.
Cora, my feets, you know?
My feets.
My feets.
They're beautiful.
- Beautiful.
- You say it.
You say it in Greek.
Nick, I can't say it in Greek.
Ah, come on,
you say it.
Yes!
Come here. Now you say it.
It's beautiful.
Tonight.
Tonight.
What?
What?
What are you doing?
You're the guy's wife, Cora.
You told me that.
You were gonna leave me.
- I was writing you a note--
- What, a thank-you note?
Huh?
- Is that what you were doing?
- Cora, look, live here.
Live with the guy.
We took a chance.
We didn't make it.
Live with the man.
He wants to have a baby.
You understand?
He's changed.
He says the accident changed him,
and now I'm supposed to have his kid.
How am I gonna do that?
How am I supposed to
have his baby?
I can't have his baby.
The only one I could have
a baby by is you.
Okay. Shh.
Say you won't leave me.
Please.
Just stall him, baby.
Just stall him.
- You going far?
- We go to Ventura.
A trip.
A change of scenery.
- Much farther?
- it's a couple hours.
That's it.
What do I owe you?
Uh, $1.44.
- Here you go.
- Be right back.
Here's your change.
I'm gonna drive now.
- You're not going to drive.
- What?
You can't even walk. What are you
talking about? Get in the back.
- What?
- Get in the back.
What are you, nutty?
I wanna drive home.
- Come on, Frank.
- You don't want to drive tonight.
What, do you own this car, big fella?
Huh?
- Frank.
- Just get in the back.
All right.
That's it.
You drive safely now, okay?
Good night.
How about some wine?
- Come on, Nick.
- Ha, ha.
Hey, Frank...
ls nothing like to have wife.
Cut it out!
Is drunk.
Shit!
Cora, don't talk like that.
It's boiling over, Nick.
I gotta pull over.
What?
Wake him up, huh?
Wake him up. Fix it.
Frank?
Frank!
Frank, wake up.
The car's stopped.
Come on, wake up.
You gotta fix it.
Frank, get out of the car.
Nick?
Shit.
I'll fix it myself.
What's the matter...
...with door?
Handle no open.
There, I got it.
Oh.
Is he dead?
Get in.
Come on, Cora.
Get in. Get in!

No.

Put it in neutral.
Push.
Wait.
Come on, Cora.
Come on.
Do it.
Do it.
Come on.
Do it!
You hurt me.
You got this on the dash.
And you don't know
where you got this.
What?
Frank!
Frank!
Oh, no-- Oh, God!
God.
Oh, God! Aah!
Stop!
Stop!
There's been an accident!
You have to help me!
Oh, God!
Thank you.
How are you today?
Fine.
Have you ever been
in San Francisco?
- Yeah.
- In Buffalo?
Who are you, mister?
You know who I am.
You did time in Buffalo.
In Wichita, armed robbery,
reduced to--
- Can we talk about this later?
- Saying you held up a card game.
Moline, Illinois, 13 months,
assault on a rail road investigator.
They gave me something.
If you plead innocent and make me try you
for homicide, I'm gonna see that you hang.
What're you saying? This have
something to do with this accident?
- I wasn't even driving.
- Oh, you weren't driving.
You were too drunk to drive,
you were too drunk to walk.
You have a witness at the station.
Yes, yes, yes.
Who do you think you're dealing with?
I know you killed him.
Come on.
Why would I want to kill him?
Oh, buddy, I saw her.
I might kill for her.
Why would I kill for that?
Forget the girl.
They'll hang you for the money.
What money?
The $10,000 life
insurance policy...
...issued on Nick Papadakis
by Pacific Reliance.
His wife, the sole beneficiary.
Does that look familiar, Frank? Huh?
Don't play with the insurance company.
They don't like to lose.
I swear I don't know nothing
about no insurance policy.
Oh, come on, Frank.
Either she did it, or you did
it together. Which is it?
- I didn't kill him.
- Prove it to me, Frank.
- How am I gonna prove it to you?
- Sign this.
What is this?
It's the only thing that will convince
me and the jury you're innocent.
All right, Frank?
Let's get out of here.
It's all right.
My name is Katz.
I'm representing you
and Mrs. Papadakis.
You two will be
arraigned tomorrow.
Until then, anybody ask you anything,
you say, "Talk to the lawyer."
You understand that, Frank?
- Yeah.
- Good.
Did you sign this?
Don't sign anything else.
Okay.
You got yourself pretty banged up.
Good.
It'll look good in court.
Hey.
Are you gonna see Cora?
Yeah.
Tell her I didn't mean it.
It was broken in the act.
It was used to strike the victim
on the head, which caused his death.
Could the victim's injuries have
been caused by an overturning car?
- No.
- I object, Your Honor.
This man is not a doctor.
This man, Your Honor,
is an acknowledged expert...
...in the field of insurance fraud.
This man is an interested party.
If my clients are convicted...
...his company, Pacific Reliance,
stands to save $10,000.
Mr. Katz.
I object and request that
his testimony be stricken.
Overruled.
Thank you, I'm finished.
Your Honor, at this time, I will submit
a complaint and request for damages...
...sworn by Frank Chambers
against Mrs. Cora Papadakis...
What?
...for injuries sustained in a car
under her control.
- Your Honor, I object to this complaint.
- What? What complaint?
Did you sign something, Frank?
Tell me. Did you sign
something against me?
- Sit down, Cora.
- You wouldn't do that to me, would you?
- He wouldn't do that!
- Your Honor, that is exactly--
What did he sign?
What complaint are you talk--?
- What complaint?
- Absent adjudication on--
Show it to me!
Show it to me!
- I want to see it! I don't believe it!
- Overruled.
- Enter the complaint.
- I don't believe it!
You cannot enter the complaint.
It was extorted from a seriously injured
man under the influence of drugs...
...and pain,
without the benefit of counsel.
I've ruled on this.
Will you proceed?
Under the circumstances
of this ruling...
...I have no alternative but to plead
Mrs. Papadakis guilty as charged.
- State accepts the plea.
- Your Honor, move to adjourn.
Accepted.
You're working for the state!
- Let go of me!
- Don't say anything to them.
- You're making a terrible mistake.
- Just shut up.
Okay, ready?
Okay, this is my statement.
We did it all.
Frank Chambers and I planned it...
...and he killed my husband.
- I'll just be a few minutes, all right?
- Fine.
- I appreciate you seeing me.
- What is it? They're guilty.
- Yeah, that's yet to be decided.
- They're guilty.
Now I can plead them
innocent in 48 hours.
Yeah, yeah. Look, they tried
to kill him once before.
Oh, that's very interesting
you should think that. Huh.
On March 5, there was a party.
I got a fucking Greek army...
...that'll swear Papadakis
said of Chambers:
"That is the man
who saved my life."
- I think you got it backwards.
- Off the record?
- Sure.
- You don't mean to say they're innocent.
That's precisely what I'm telling you.
And that's what I'll tell the jury.
The prosecution's got no case.
No evidence, no witnesses, nothing!
All they've got is you.
And what are you doing, huh?
Don't forget, I am talking
to poor people out there.
Now, that jury, they have
got a very attractive...
...grief-stricken young woman
on that stand on the one hand.
And on the other hand,
they got you, pal.
You and your, uh, big insurance
company, trying to save 10 grand.
We'll see.
What do you think?
I still think they're
gonna burn them.
And if they don't...
...you've cost your
company 10 grand.
There goes your Christmas bonus.
You wanna take that chance?
I'm gonna show you a way that you
don't have to take a chance.
Now what?
Okay.
This is Art Beeman, Claims Department,
Western Equitable.
Hello, Beeman.
- Glad to meet you.
- Tell him.
Well, uh, my company issued
a $25,000 liability policy...
...home, business, auto...
...to Mr. Nick Papadakis,
just slightly before his death--
Frank Chambers was
a passenger in the car.
He sustained various lacerations,
a concussion and back trauma...
...which will impair
his ability to walk.
If she was trying to kill her husband
and in the process, made my man...
...an employee and passenger
in her car, a cripple for life...
...I'm gonna go into court and sue Western
Equitable for 25 grand, and I'm gonna win.
So here's what he's prepared to do.
Would you excuse us, please?
I would.
Western's in an
unprotected posture here.
You're saying you'd reimburse?
Precisely.
Now, if you were prepared,
we'd pay the $10,000 death benefit.
- Cleared this with your people?
- Absolutely.
Well,
I think we can do business.
Here you go, Frank.
I already signed for them.
Go ahead.
Come on, take it.
No, we got 27 up here already.
Make that 26.
They never had a thing.
They bluffed you.
Sackett bluffed you.
Gets you to sign a complaint
against the woman...
...uses it to get her to confess,
and you both walk the plank.
Get it?
Come on, my boy.
You're going home.
- Come on, we'll get you changed.
- You're kidding.
You're kidding me!
Here you are.
She's free?
That is correct.
- But, uh...
- But what?
She confessed.
Luckily, she confessed
to my assistant, Kennedy.
Red-headed guy?
Bet you thought he was a cop, huh?
Yeah, I did.
- Uh-uh. He wasn't. Works for me.
- Really?
Mm-hm.
Thought it might be a good idea
to get it off her chest.
She seemed very upset.
Frank, uh...
Let's go out the back way,
avoid the press, okay? Come on.
Where are they going?
Where's the girl?
The best part was the insurance.
Mr. Barlow, their expert, stands up
in court, says he made a great mistake.
The whole thing was
an auto accident.
Hell of a world, huh, Frank?
Yeah.
Where's Cora?
Outside in a cab,
waiting with Kennedy.
I knew I'd find you here,
sneaking out.
- Yeah, that's right.
- You'd best sneak out.
The file stays open on you.
On you and the woman both.
You put yourselves above the law.
You killed.
You can't talk to me that way.
I been inside a court of law!
You'll be back, my friend.
I know your type.
Yeah, I'll see you again.
Spit on the sidewalk,
you'll die in jail.
Hey, hey.
Learn to lose, huh?
Well, uh...
Thanks a lot.
That's okay.
You took our part, eh?
And you made me $10,000.
Kennedy.
It's been swell.
I had to pay him the
insurance money, the lawyer.
Yeah, I know.
I didn't even know
he had an insurance policy.
Can't leave this state for six months.
I gotta call them every week.
I'm gonna have a record.
Cora?
I didn't mean to turn on you.
That's mine.
- She doesn't look that old.
- That's her. I saw her picture.
- She is acting exactly as I expected.
- She'll hear you.
Wonderful pie.
Miss?
Keep the change.
Thanks. Come again, huh?
- Miss?
- Yeah.
What about that chicken?
I'll have it in two minutes.
You think you could
get in and help out?
You're doing fine.
I'm doing fine. I'd do better
if you'd do some work around here.
What are you killing yourself for?
We're leaving in two months.
It's what you said. Soon as your
probation's up, we're leaving.
You want to leave, Frank?
You can go now.
You want to stay,
then do some work around here.
And will you use a glass?
What are you, an animal?
What are you
gonna do with the money?
I'm gonna buy a new car.
What the hell do you care
what I'm gonna do?
Move!
Move over. Come on!
Bastard, get out of there.
Get out.
Come on, move.
Damn it, you bastard!
You folks need something?
There you go, gentlemen.
I've been looking for you.
Well, you found me.
I saw your picture in the paper.
Join the club.
Here's a menu.
I'll be right back.
You know, I knew you
since you were a little girl.
I knew it was you.
But I didn't want to call.
I knew they'd lost track of you.
I get the Courier still...
...from home.
And I read about your mother.
I was pretty sure
you didn't know.
Oh, you don't remember me...
...but I remember you.
- Want me to call the probation people?
- Don't call them.
I'll be back next week,
the latest.
I'm sure she'll be all right.
Let me know, huh?
Yeah, I will.
So, what is this, a holiday?
Closed.
Come on, give me a break, huh?
What will it take you, a minute?
Where you heading?
San Diego.
What have you got in the back there,
if you don't mind my asking?
Cats.
What is this?
It's three cats.
What are they, drugged?
No, they're tired.
They're very tired.
These cats are drugged!
I tell you they will not perform!
I won't get in the ring with them.
Take them out of here.
All right, all right.
What is it you need?
I told you. I need performers.
I need wild animals.
- Where do you get them?
- Gutierrez.
- Where are they?
- Mexico.
All right, you get the cats.
Join back up in Tucson on the 12th.
You do it.
- Okay. Okay.
- Good?
Anything else you need?
Of course. A driver.
Excuse me, that lady...
I just want you to put--
Take the cats away.
I'm sorry.
You're right about that,
you know, miss.
What's that?
I just rode 100 miles with these cats,
and, uh, they didn't peep once.
Is that so?
Here's a fine little animal.
Peep.
What about that?
And who,
might I ask, are you?
Frank Chambers, miss.
Pleased to meet you, Frank.
You know what I'd do for you?
Buy you a hat.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Big white one.
You'd like that?
Sure.
Caress.
Sorry about your mother,
Cora.
She was old.
Let's get a drink.
No, I quit it.
I'm not drinking anymore.
I've been thinking
about a lot of things, Frank.
Let's just go home.
I'm gonna have a baby.
I'm gonna have your baby, Frank.
You want it?
Yeah, I do.
- Tell me you want it.
- I do.
- You do?
- I do want it, yeah.
- You do!
- Sure.
Whoa!
Jeez.
We're gonna have a baby, huh?
Think about that.
Yeah.
We lost some business, Cora.
I don't care.
Ahem. I closed the place for a week.
Went to San Francisco.
I don't care, Frank.
I've been wrong,
haven't I?
No.
Yes, I have.
I know I have.
I've been making
our life hell here.
But...
I'm gonna change now.
Because if we got
each other, Frank...
...then we got everything.
I want you to forgive me.
Please, God. Oh, God.
Hey. Come on.
So you wanna know what
I learned about babies?
What the most important thing is?
Yeah.
Is that you always gotta
be natural with them.
I'm always natural.
Because they can tell, you know.
Young as they are, they know.
- Yeah, I believe that.
- So what you gotta do is two things.
First one...
First one is you gotta
follow your instincts.
What is it?
The second thing--
Tell them to go away.
I'll get rid of them.
Closed.
Can I bother you for a minute?
- We're closed.
- It won't take but a minute. Please.
Just a minute.
Mr. Kennedy.
Remember me?
Yeah, sure.
How's Mr. Katz?
Yeah, right.
But, uh,
I don't work for him anymore.
- Is that right?
- Yeah.
What are you doing now?
Uh, well, as a matter of fact,
I'm not doing anything.
That's why I thought I'd drop by.
You know, I thought maybe
you could help me out.
Oh, yeah? In what way?
What do you need,
a couple of bucks or something?
I mean,
I know you're out of a job--
You remember that...
...that confession
that I typed up that time?
Yeah, that phony thing
you and Katz dreamed up?
Yeah, right.
Yeah, well, you know,
when I left Katz...
...l, uh, took the liberty of
taking it with me from his files.
You know, I thought
the two of you might like it.
Uh-huh.
Nice place here.
You want $100?
I want 10 grand.
Ten grand? What are you, crazy, bozo?
What are you, insane?
- We gave the money to Katz.
- Who cares?
I just want the money.
Get it for me.
- Hey.
- Sell the place.
Bring me 10 or I mail the confession
to Sackett, and you die.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Are you kidding me? Huh?
Fuck with my family!
Huh? Huh?
Where's the paper?
- I can't tell you.
- Where's the paper?
- I got it in the bank.
- In the bank?
- Which one?
- I can't tell you.
Which one?
Which one?
Glendale Trust.
Get the gun.
How do you feel?
I feel great.
I'll get back as soon as I can.
You want anything from town?
Let's go, Kennedy.
You folks open?
Sure.
Cora?
Cora?
Your friend came by.
You bastard!
Don't come near me.
You're scum, Frank.
I knew that when I met you.
You'll never change.
Your confession.
I don't even need it.
I never did.
They tried me for it once, Frank.
They can't touch me now.
You understand?
It's in the Constitution.
Didn't you know that, Frank?
But they can try you.
They can still try you.
Who are you calling?
I'm cold.
I'm cold.
You sure about that?
I want to marry you.
You just want to shut me up.
If I wanted to shut you up,
I'd have shut you up.
I want to marry you.
That what you want?
Yeah.
Today.
Do you want to wait
till the weekend?
You know, I've been thinking.
Maybe we ought to
sell that place.
Ah, it ain't bad out
here for kids.
Keep pets.
- Don't walk in there.
- Why not?
You got a beer there? Huh?
- There you go.
- Get the opener?
Yep.
That's it.
That's it.
What's wrong?
- It's okay.
- What's wrong?
- You all right?
- Hurt for a minute.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
- It's okay.
- No, no. Come on, get in. Take it easy.
Yeah, it was just a minute.
Kind of scared me.
We'll get somebody
to take a look at you.
- No, I'm fine.
- Hey, you listen to me.
I just want to go home,
really, Frank.
I'll have you looked at.
I just felt a little funny.
Like I strained something.
That's what I mean.
Feeling a little better?
I feel great.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Good. You look good.
- Yeah.
You do.
Why shouldn't I?
