<i>Honey, it's me.</i>
Darling, I told you,
don't call me here.
<i>Honey, it's urgent</i>
<i>I'm missing
figurants for tomorrow</i>
<i>Some have cancelled</i>
<i>They are at the funeral
of a supermarket owner</i>
It's better paid.
Filipov !
I told you
you are mistaken!
Andreï Semionovitch Filipov !
I told you not
to assist in the rehearsals
You are a janitor.
I know...
Pardon, Leonid Dimitrievitch.
You promised me...
No means no!
You will conduct
when the time is ripe.
Don't start again
with your so called orchestra!
Follow me!
This is how you show
your love for the Bolchoi?
How can I trust you?
Let's talk about the orchestra
when all is clean.
It will be clean.
Before tomorrow morning!
<i>Email deleted</i>
Erased. Never even heard about it!
Go on, Goliath,
hire Bill Gates to find it.
I want the contract
for the Genkin marriage
He's looking for 1000 figurants
He's a mobster!
They all are!
They send their kids to college
in London
- But they're still mobsters
- So what?
1000 figurants!
Can you imagine?
He doesn't even know 200 persons
He will ask for 800 more.
What the cash we can buy
a massive place in the countryside
with a nice vegetable garden.
We wouldn't have to buy
our vegetables at a huge expense.
They raised my pension
by 100 rubles
and the rent by 300 !
30 rubles for 1kg of potatoes yesterday
Do you realize?
We'll sell the piano.
We won't sell it.
He doesn't want any more guests
except for the Makarov wedding
to prove he's got bigger balls.
Ira !
Will you help me, Honey?
Will you call me?
Yes, Sacha. So?
Thanks, you're an angel,
you saved my life.
I assure you...
hang on...
You said you had 19.
OK, thanks
see you later.
Honey...
I know you're tired
but i'm still missing an extra.
I'm coming, I'll be right there
The people...
The people are on our side!
History is on our side!
We are marching to victory
of a righteous ideology
toward Communism!
We need to talk.
Everyday they make promises.
28, 29, 30 !
You asked for 30,
there are 30
They're all there, you pay for 30!
Irina, listen,
I propose a deal:
500 for each
plus a bonus of 100 rubles
but you come back next sunday
600 for 2 sundays. OK?
I say no, Gavrilov !
Every sunday the same thing
It's 400 rubles per head
per day
- Don't you have any faith?
- I never had any faith!
You and your Party
can go to hell!
I want my 12 000 rubles.
Right now!
- That's extortion.
- C'mon!
You have no morals!
<i>The Union of moscow musicians</i>
Just a bit, Andreï.
It's not gonna kill you
Go on, Andreï !
C'mon, Andreï...
You're still our leader, aren't you?
No
Didn't you hear?
Come

<i>"To Mr. Leonid Vinitchenko,
Director of the Bolchoi.</i>
<i>"Dear Mr. Vinitchenko,
while consulting your website</i>
<i>I discovered your orchestra is available</i>
<i>in two weeks time, on saturday june 13th</i>
<i>the L.A. Philharmonic having cancelled their tour of France</i>
<i>Would you be willing to replace them?</i>
<i>We would be honored
to welcome you</i>
<i>and give our audience
a night to remember</i>
<i>This is an official invitation.</i>
<i>I suggest we talk about this tomorrow afternoon on the phone</i>
<i>at 4pm Moscow time</i>
<i>Yours sincerely</i>
<i>"Olivier Morne Duplessis,</i>
<i>Director of the Théâtre du Châtelet</i>
It's in russian. Must be a joke.
It's signed! There's the stamp.
The address is french.
So what?
We'll take their place!
To Paris !
Le Théâtre du Châtelet !
What a dream come true !
The Bolchoi Orchestra in Paris,
at the Châtelet !
What? Are you crazy?
You want to pretend
you are the Bolchoi ?
Yes! They are worthless
We are way better.
Get rid of this
before we end up in prison.
Honey, are you there?
Yes I am.
Andreï, do you need help?
Honey, let me in.
Don't worry, I'm fine.
We're just chatting, my love
You scared me.
Little boys...
We haven't played in 30 years
We're just bums.
Where are you gonna find an orchestra?
To the right
No place to rehearse
No money, no time
to make up a real orchestra
80 musicians in 14 days !
Have you gone mad?
Why no dancers?
Turn right
55 musicians.
We need 55 musicians!
Be quiet, it's over there.
<i>House of the Communist Party</i>
Anyway, they will phone Leonid tomorrow
and that will be the end of it.
Not if we phone first.
What ? The Communist Party?
Are you mental?
Ivan Gavrilov...
Ivan KGB Gavrilov !
You're a sick man!
What are we gonna do?
Ivan knows them.
His french is better than Molière's
Of course, Molière is dead!
We need him.
He ruined your career
and mine!
He only obeyed orders.
Not true.
He went on stage in the middle
of the Tchaikovsky concerto
in front of a live audience,
he stopped the concerto just to humiliate you!
He got a kick out of it!
He's the devil that guy!
I'm not going in.
We'll never get out twice
of a communist dictatorship.
Sacha...
Would you like to pick up the cello again?
Or do you prefer to drive an ambulance
for the rest of your life?
Ivan Gavrilov owns us a concert.
The Concert !
Do you still know how to manage an orchestra?
First of all, good morning!
Which orchestra?
A kind of Bolchoi,
but not THE Bolchoi.
The Bolchoi, yes or no?
Yes and no. Both.
We're looking for a better manager
for a concert abroad.
Who's this "we"?
The bloody orchestra
you destroyed 30 years ago
- Idiot!
- Sacha, be calm!
All these voyages
we weren't allowed to make, you jerk!
Scum ! 30 years ago
You would have asked political asylum
even in Patagonia
you would have betrayed your grandma
and believed the capitalist press
even the nation that raised you
where you were born and bred
I had my sources!
Whose nation?
Bastard!
Dirty, crushed, humiliated. Yes!
Torn apart!
You tore us apart!
You were responsable! Bastard!
You're a bastard yourself!
Piece of shit ambulance driver!
It's your fault
that I'm an ambulance driver
That my wife and kids have left me!
Because of me?
Because of your big mouth!
You didn't want to follow them
to Israel, your land
I had my information.
I don't have to leave
My country is here!
Your country? You betrayed it!
That's enough! Can't we talk?
Sacha...
Ivan, we're here to talk about Paris.
About a concert in the Théâtre du Châtelet.
They want a reply by tomorrow
- Which Paris?
- Read this!
The Bolchoi Orchestra
is like the Wailing Wall.
They're playing so heavy footed.
Can you imagine the french press?
Did you say Paris?
They'll say:
The russian orchestras are not
what they used to be.
Can we as russians accept that?
Paris...
Why me?
You'll do all negociations
like in the old days.
You were the best manager
in the history of The Bolchoi.
Paris...
Agreed.
Why?
What do you mean?
What are you playing at?
Spit it out!
- What's your price?
- No price.
He's playing us.
For free? Are you sure?
Absolutely.
I could get you a ex-soldier card
so you can travel for free on public transport
I already got that.
I said "agreed"
I'll do it.
You have my word.
Did you see that look, that smile?
He's so fake, watch your back.
He's gonna screw us again
Hand over that fax.
I saw in his eyes the desire,
the will to go through with it.
<i>PARIS</i>
Ivan Gavrilov ?
How many seats in the Châtelet ?
I don't know.
1 500...
2 000.
I found out on the Web
2 000?
Andreï, I'll be leaving you
if you're not going
Show me you're still the maestro.
and you'll play this concert
'till the end
30 years... I've been waiting
30 years.
<i>Tchaikovsky</i>
<i>Concerto</i>
<i>People's enemy</i>
<i>Curtain!</i>
Is this phone working?
I call my family in Israel from here.
I want this to work!
Without paying? You don't have the right.
- It belongs to the State, to the People.
- You want me to use sign language?
Silence !
Quickly.
Good day, my dear!
Greetings!
How are you today?
Mr comrade Ivan Gavrilov speaking.
Director of The Bolchoi.
I would like a kind word with
Monsieur Duplessis.
Could you please introduce me
if you please?
One minute, please...
I'm calling from Moscow!
One minute...
Mr. Director, how are you?
<i>Ah, wunderbar !
Fantastically great, thank you</i>
Pardon me, I didn't know you were
the new Bolchoi administrator
I'll send the fax in your name.
It's not so bad, don't apologize
Mr. Duplessis,
I'm not calling you from the office
We're having some technical problems
with telecommunication
No need to shout,
I hear you perfectly.
<i>Excuse me</i>
It will be me who'll be calling each time,
that's more convenient
OK.
I will share with you
my cell phone number
<i>You have something to write with?</i>
Go ahead, I'm listening.
0 and another 0
7-910-46
18-830.
Ivan, the concert,
Do you think it's possible?
<i>It all depends</i>
on terms and conditions.
We'll have to cancel
a very lucrative gig.
According to your website,
you are completely free of commitment.
<i>A private concert</i>
Very private even,
for the president of the eastern-russia gaz company
You understand?
The anniversary of his rule
sort to speak
A discrete and private concert
but the entire orchestra is needed.
<i>Listen, I propose I send you</i>
today a contract stating our terms
so you know our demands.
And if these are satisfactory
We can foresee to put our signatures
on the contract.
Fine, I'll wait for your proposal
but quickly please,
the concert is in 2 weeks time.
What's the program?
<i>The program...?</i>
Yes, the program
The program, idiots!
Tchaikovsky.
Ivan...
are you still there?
Tchaikovsky.
We shall be playing Tchaikovsky.
The violin concerto
Here we go again.
Tchaikovsky, you say?
Tchaikovsky.
<i>The violin concerto</i>
Hello...the connection
I'm don't hear you very well.
Bravo! Done! Happy?
And you, 30 years ago?
What do you mean?
You were perfect
You're still the best.
I know.
Negotiation is like riding a bike.
You never forget.
So, do they agree?
We got them by the balls!
2000$ per musician!
I doubled the price.
No, it's a marriage.
Bring the entire family.
Payment : 30 euros/day
That's 350 rubles
and free lunch.
4000$ for Andreï.
The program:
Tchaikovsky and then what?
<i>What do you mean, "after" ?</i>
It's not enough, it's too short.
Sacha will pick you up in the ambulance.
<i>The Sérénade by Tchaikovsky
and Symphony n°1 by Prokofiev.</i>
Fine. The flight and insurance
will be paid by Paris.
The State used to take care of everything.
Not anymore.
OK, the planning...
Day 1: arrival
and fancy dinner in the famous Trou Normand.
Day 2: rehearsal, and of course
every visit to Paris demands
in the evening...
a boat ride on the Seine.
Day 3: the concert
Agreed?
Very well.
Everything OK?
I got the wedding : 1000 figurants.
We'll have our vegetable garden.
Ira, the sugar...
Right away...
I'll give you a hand.
He wants to do Tchaikovsky.
- I know. And you'll help.
- Me?
Yes you.
Now go...
I want the hotel Paris Lumière.
Close to the Champs-Élysées.
The best.
3 stars!
The main thing...
Who'll be the soloist?
Only one name comes up...
Anne-Marie Jacquet.
Anne-Marie Jacquet. Are you kidding?
She's a star!
Very good! Very good!
We are also stars.
Jacquet, Jacquet!
Anne-Marie Jacquet and nobody else.
Aren't we asking for too much?
You have to be demanding and temperamental.
It shows you're serious
and professional too.
The fees, the expenses...
They seem the same as before the perestroika.
Must be a favour thanks to the good
relationship with Mr Gavrilov.
Maybe. Could be a prank too.
We should be concerned.
Last meeting, we agreed to a prestigious
concert with the LA Philharmonic.
Now we don't have the LA Philharmonic
and a deficit of 1.15 million Euro
and not 450 thousand as we first thought
Stop bothering me with that!
What else is there?
3 days in Paris instead of
arriving on the day like most orchestras.
Some strange demands like a bootride on the Seine
and dinner at the Trou Normand.
- You know that place?
- No.
They make me sick. I say no!
- Do you want to take them to the Trou?
- Still far less expensive than the LA Ph.
3 days of leasure, the restaurant...
Do they think that's professional, those slavics?
What about the Jacquets?
How much will they cost?
A lot, but even with the long stay and all expenses
still cheaper than the LA Ph.
55% cheaper, if she were to refuse
even 75% cheaper
No Anne-Marie Jacquet, no Bolchoi
and no concert.
Without her, they won't even come over
They make me sick!
Get me her agent.
I understand, Olivier.
Nothing I can do about it.
It's no, don't call again.
I'm sorry too.
Good luck and goodbye.
We're going in 45 minutes.
- Who was it?
- Nobody.
An interview for a brazilian magazine,
"Why you're not married" that sort of thing.
Did they ask why I'm not playing Tchaikovsky?
Tchaikovsky? No...
I never heard you say that
<i>"She doesn't play Tchaikovsky".
No.</i>
Well yeah, they asked me.
What are you doing?
Redialling the last number.
It was Duplessis.
The Tchaikovsky concerto at the Châtelet
in two weeks, can you imagine?
Between Madrid and Chicago.
They just phoned me,
no manners...
What orchestra?
The Bolchoi
<i>What? The Bolchoi and you said no?</i>
You've never played that concerto, it's right between
Madrid and Chicago. Unreasonable...
The high fibre bread wasn't fresh, I didn't get any.
The honey will arrive tomorrow.
Mine will arrive tomorrow.
Are you serious?
I know I was always scared to play Tchaikovsky
But my dream is to play the Tchaikovsky
with the Bolchoi.
You know, Guylène?
The chef's an unknown and the orchestra
is not what it used to be
It's too great a risk.
What's the conductor's name?
I don't know, I don't recall.
Filipov, something like that.
André Filipov?
Yes.
That's right. Does it ring a bell?
Are you joking?
Does it ring a bell?
The maestro, Guylène!
He's the legendary maestro!
To play Tchaikovsky with him...
- How dare you ask...
- He hasn't conducted in 30 years
You'll phone Duplissis, I will accept
whatever the conditions.
Understood?
Listen, I'd love to convince her
but I'm afraid she'll say no.
She has Madrid before and Chicago shortly after.
Guylène, how much?
Good god!
Rivka, come see who's here!
The one who dared say "shit"
to Brezjnev.
- Your lips?
- Your astma?
He refuses treatment.
He barks like a donkey.
When I cough, I play better.
Come in!
Are there still synagogues in Paris ?
Do they like jews over there?
More synagogues than churches
There's one in every street.
There's no more churches.
Those catholics have all become infidels.
Really? What about the Notre-Dame?
Did you see on TV the death
of cardinal whats-his-name?
They danced the kaddish
in front of the Notre-Dame.
It's all jewish outside
and catholic inside.
half jew, half christian.
Are you coming, Viktor ?
For you, Andreï.
In this place, you're a wise one.
I'm taking along my son, Moïse.
He's the Louis Armstrong of classical music.
Better than his father.
May the Lord protect you!
Amen !
- Taxi !
- Micha !
Go away, Andreï !
You bring bad luck.
Watch it,
Easy!
The violin!
<i>Natalia Grossman - Israel</i>
When will she receive it?
In one week, as usual.
OK
Are we going?
More than 3 days.
No percussion,
no contrabass
I'll do them with my mouth.
This is crazy,
we'll never pull this off.
We'll never get a complete orchestra.
Andreï, we are going to Paris.
The main thing is not arriving in Paris...
I know: Tchaikovsky,
It's the damn Tchaikovsky!
I can't do it,
It's been 30 years.
I shouldn't have started this.
Tchaikovsky,
is in your blood.
You bombarded us with his music
all the time, in those days.
How many times have you played that music
in your head, these last 30 years?
We can all hear it.
Irina, me, I can't go on.
We are going to Paris so
you can liberate poor Tchaikovsky.
You didn't want to go.
Me?
No way. I love Paris.
Please, have a seat.
Who wants to go to Paris?
A concert at the Châtelet.
Tchaikovsky
The violin concerto
Go away!
You're drunk, Andreï !
Makarov !
Why the long face?
Normally, he had only 500 guests
at the wedding.
At my table!
Check out the family-in-law!
Cheers! Hurrah!
Cheers.
Were you invited? This is private.
Bad news!
Paris is not paying for the flight beforehand.
They will reimburse the tickets
upon arrival.
- How so?
- Times have changed.
The Bolchoi have to pay all expenses up front
You're lying! You don't want
this concert to happen, admit it!
Find a solution.
Like what?
A sponsor.
A rich man.
Well connected.
An oil baron!
They're buying football clubs,
they don't care about music.
Music is downloaded for free.
Listen to me, Gavrilov !
30 years ago,
When you did your little act,
in the middle of my husband's concerto
condemning him to alcoholism
you ruined his life.
And when we lost our dearest friends,
I said nothing. I was wrong.
So shut up and don't get involved
in music no more
or else I'll beat you up!
Sorry.
You go find them a sponsor.
and you will take them
on a nice trip to Paris.
And if it doesn't go well,
don't come back.
Ask political asylum over there!
Otherwise your sunday manifestations
will turn into some solo performance
without an auditorium
Nobody will play the extra
in this damn town
Do you understand?
And don't ever mess again
with my man!
Silence !
Sit down!
Ladies and gentlemen,
my dear old friends,
Minister,
members of parliament,
I present you the Tsar of gaz,
The King of Cobalt
One of the greatest success stories
of our beloved Russia
My friend,
the best cellist on the planet...
Piotr Trétiakine !
Go on!
Applaud!
Go on, Petya...
Go on, Petya...
I prefer my asthma.
They are deaf, that's worse.
Shut up!
Yes, yes, Ivan Gavrilov.
Yeah yeah...
Vas-y, Petya !
Take care of yourself!
<i>No Trou Normand,
No concert !</i>
<i>I want Le Trou Normand !</i>
He hung up on me because
of the Trou Normand
No, no, it's not my fault
I can't find the Trou Normand
The place does not exist or
at least not where he says it is.
We got Anne-Marie Jacquet.
She's agreed, but...
There's a restaurant at
the address they gave us
We ask the owner to change its
name for one night and that is that.
Then phone Gavrilov, tell him it's a done deal
and have him sign the damned contract!
One week before the concert: billboards,
press and TV campaign...
Filipov & Jacquet!
Fantastic!
Die, you sonofabitch!
Don't shoot!
Mr Trétiakine !
You play so well
Mr Trétiakine !
I am Ivan Gavrilov.
Have you heard of me?
I heard you on phone.
I'm sorry.
I admire your musical talent.
I'm the director of the Bolchoi.
We'll be playing shortly
in Paris, in the Châtelet.
Big spender,
wouldn't you like to sponsor us?
Director of the Bolchoi ?
Yes
- Paris ?
- Yes.
<i>Théâtre du Châtelet ?</i>
<i>Paris, Théâtre du Châtelet !</i>
Gentlemen, I'm honored.
You see mother,
those cello lessons were worth it.
You play like a statue!
Buy a football club!
<i>Buy Paris St Germain
can't be too expensive.</i>
And take Messi,
Put him in point
Many thanks, Mr. Trétiakine.
We'll be in touch.
Maman, my compliments.
I will escort you.
No, I'm thanking you.
My driver will come and
pick up the sheet music
I'm flattered to be able
to play in your orchestra.
And I'm ready.
Business is just a hobby
but music...
Music is my life!
Goodbye.
Thank you very much.
I'm a musician, not a noise maker!
Go back!
We'll give his check back.
We'll be the laughing stock for all.
Calm down,
we got the orchestra.
We got Anne-Marie Jacquet,
We got the plane tickets
and a jerk in the cello section!
What did you say?
I said: I got good news
and some bad news.
The bad news first...
We need a visum
to enter France.
And most of us don't even have a passport.
Getting a passport takes 1 month,
a visa only a week.
Now you tell us this?
The good news?
<i>We'll dine at  Le Trou Normand !</i>
55 ? Passports and visas ?
Including you, Maestro ?
56, Ivan included.
Let's make it 60, in case...
We'll fill out the names
at the very last minute.
Can you do this in one day?
No problem.
That's gotta cost a lot!
We're no millionnaires. The People...
OK, we'll pay.
Everyone bring a recent photo.
and we'll do it on the spot.
Vassili, one last thing...
Whatever you wish, Maestro.
We're a bit tight on instruments.
Some players, over the years
had to sell their instruments.
The concert costumes,
the shoes...
Complicated.
We'll see in Paris.
I got many friends over there.
We can't wait till then.
Andreï, my grand mother
used to say:
<i>"The sun always rises in the morning,
never at night" Do you understand?</i>
Which grand-mother?
You don't get it.
Let me explain.
Over here, it's always night
In Paris: morning!
Viktor, take care of Moïse.
Don't sleep with an open window.
Mama, I'm 35.
And yet still not married!
Even Léon the hunchback
he found himself a wife.
<i>Shalom Alékum, everybody !</i>
Go faster comrades!
Hurry up!
When you arrive,
hang up your trousers.
It's a good hotel,
they do have an iron.
Tell them to shine your shoes.
I don't want you looking like a bum.
Do you hear me?
Where are the busses?
Patience, patience...
They're 45 minutes late.
Will they all halt here?
Are you happy?
Have you seen the busses?
Yes, more or less.
I saw the front of a bus.
The front? Are you for real?
- Did you pay them?
- Of course I did.
Of course they're not here.
Some manager you are!
Should we call taxis?
How many are we?
Taxis ?
That's not in my budget.
Don't panic, we still got time.
Gavrilov, I'll kill you!
Cool it, we still got hours left.
Why did we come this early?
A good manager forsees trouble.
I'm a pro.
I knew they wouldn't come.
<i>Airport 7 km</i>
Thanks, Vassili.
Come closer, we're taking a picture!
Stand still!
We're going over the details, but quickly.
Quickly, quickly...
You have a picture?
Move it, move it...
Next!
Next!
Only to France?
A visa to Morocco is only 10$ more.
I don't know anyone in Morocco.
- Papa, you never know.
- I said no.
A plastic cover is an option.
3,50 $.
No thanks.
- A leather wallet?
- No...
- Papa...
- Non !
Thanks.
Gorgeous, would you like a manicure?
Can I read your palm?
He's with us.
Youlia, I already told you...
Read me the contract.
Article 1...
All is well
The plane's arrived.
Bolchoi? Hello, Mr Filipov
Welcome to Paris.
I'm honored.
No, please, Mr. Duplessis,
this man is not Mr. Filipov.
I'm not Mr Duplessis.
Nice to meet you!
Ivan Gavrilov, I'm honored!
This gentleman is Mr. Trétiakin.
Here's Mr Filipov !
Andreï Filipov... Olivier Duplessis.
I'm not Duplessis, I'm Jean-Paul Carrea.
He sends his kindest regards.
Where's Mr. Duplessis ?
Where's the orchestra?
Please try to understand, sir.
We've been travelling without pause
for weeks on end.
Everyone is exhausted.
I see.
No, you can't understand.
We're off to the hotel, understood?
Certainly.
Tomorrow: rehearsal
Tomorrow evening: Mr Filipov will have dinner with Anne-Marie Jacquet
at her demand.
and later on, a late night boatride on the Seine
for about 2 hours and 20 minutes.
<i>What about  Le Trou Normand ?</i>
Tonight, we have reserved
the entire restaurant for you
Crook! Thief!
Our money, now!
What's he saying?
They want half of their salary
now in cash!
- We want to eat.
- And buy cigarettes!
- And drink!
- Yes, drink!
Expenses!
They want expenses paid!
Please calm down!
We'll settle that tomorrow...
Give us our money, you bastard!
Let's kill him!
You won't need anything tonight!
Tear him apart!
<i>You are all invited to dinner at Le Trou Norman</i>
Look for our money, little one!
Mr Gavrilov, talk to them!
If I were you, I'd pay.
Ladies and gentlemen!
They are savages, they want money now
- Let them wait
- No, I'm not going to pay with my card at all!
Why not?
Last time, I got my money back after 4 months
- I was suspended for one year!
- But you got it back in the end?
- Yes, I got it yesterday.
- Stop bothering me with this.
Give them the money right now.
Yes, I hear you
No problem.
Your attention please.
Our young friend has heard you
and understands.
Your money is here!
<i>We dine at the Trou Normand !</i>
Rehearsal tomorrow morning!
The bus leaves at 10,
don't be late!
Do you have the key?
André?
It's me.
My god!
Guylène...
It's...
I'm happy to see you.
How's it going? You haven't changed a bit.
Right. Have a seat.
Tell me André, you didn't come
to take her with you?
What are you saying?
No, of course not.
Are you sure?
Look in my eyes.
I came for the concert.
She's grown up now.
I don't want any trouble.
It was difficult enough already.
Guylène,
I would never do that.
What do you take me for?
What do you think, me ? Never!
I was clear,
we understand each other.
Isn't it, André?
Good night.
Good night.
Excuse me, sir...
You didn't get the others?
They all left.
<i>To the Trou Normand? Alone?</i>
Probably, they left on foot.
What are you doing?
Are we going to dinner?
<i>Do you really want to perform
the Sérénade by Tchaikovsky?</i>
<i>and the Prokofiev Symphonie?
You hate Prokofiev !</i>
<i>We're playing the Tchaikovsky Concerto,
that's all. I don't care about the rest.</i>
But the Châtelet...
New shoes?
Let me see.
What is that?
All albums of Anne-Marie Jacquet ?
From the very first.
And all reviews I could find.
How 'bout that!
You're either a great fan or ...
You and Irina, how's things?
Think.
How old do you think she is?
Anne-Marie Jacquet ?
25 more or less?
Look closely.
29 years old.
Rewind 29 years...
29 years...
No!
My god! You mean...
It's her?
It is her!
Exactly.
Well done, you found out.
It's her.
Goodevening, sir
Goodevening.
Have we arrived at...
<i>Le Trou Normand ?</i>
<i>Indeed, Le Trou Normand</i>
And you, you are...
You are the Bolchoi?
Don't worry
the others are coming too
they're walking from the 8th burrough
Has comrade Maurice returned?
Maurice? Non.
Are we going now?
Thank you very much.
Your table...
have a seat please
Here or there
wherever you'd like.
Here, here.
- Here.
- Very well.
C'mon Jessica
A hamburger, the least expensive one
No cheese,...
no bacon, little meat, many bread.
That'll be 0,95 EUR
Two then.
and 2 glasses of tab water
That's less expensive as
McDo in Moscow!
I've taken ketchup, mayo and mustard.
10 of each.
It's free.
<i>Ivan's waiting for us in the Trou Normand.</i>
I don't dine with the KGB.
Does Irina know?
About Anne-Marie Jacquet ?
No, it's a secret.
You never contacted Anne-Marie ?
She knows nothing?
You came over just to conduct, isn't it?
Don't mix your private and personal life.
Only to conduct.
Tchaikovsky !
Only Tchaikovsky!
To the end!
Just the concert.
Promise me you won't tell her anything.
What shall we do?
Are we going to wait some more?
No, you can start dinner,
I'm very hungry.
Very well, mister is very hungry.
Some more...
<i>Everything OK, honey?</i>
<i>You sound feeble</i>
All's well, my darling.
I miss you, that's all.
<i>I miss you too, darling.</i>
<i>Sleep tight,
you must rest.</i>
Irisha, I...
I won't succeed.
I wish you were here.
<i>I am with you, honey.
You will do it, I believe in you.</i>
<i>I'm gonna hang up, it's too expensive.</i>
<i>I love you.
Call me before the concert</i>
<i>Have a great rehearsal</i>
Kiss, kiss...
Kiss, kiss,...
For  you...
What is it?
Don't play me, it's late
I'm tired, we're closing
You joking! Please correct!
Do you really think I will hand out
1107 Euro for a plate of couscous?
60 plates
But I was on my own.
not 60 dishes eaten, but
60 dishes ordered and thrown in the bin
I should make you pay double.
Hand it over.
The Châtelet has to pay.
They made the reservation.
I'll make you stay here eternally
if you don't pay right now.
My name is Ahmed Al Qaeda
Right, I'll make the payment.
Make it so!
Ivan!
Momo !
You're late.
Where were you?
I'm sorry, I come from a
lenghty Party meeting
So happy to see you!
Whatever happened to the Trou Normand?
That used to be our HQ, Momo
It will all be sold.
Non !
There's more desks than members.
There's hardly any money left.
Let's go to a real frech bar,OK?
A real french café, where we can debate.
Momo...
It's time for change...
To place the communist party again
at the head of France, of the world.
To set an example.
Are you ready?
<i>Russian TV</i>
Hello
Mr Filipov, such pleasure to welcome you!
We're all set
Your french admirers are present
In just a few hours
all will be ready.
- Isn't it wonderful?
- Thank you.
My pleasure.
I'm eternally grateful.
<i>Spasiba Bolchoi</i>
What's he rambling on about Bolchoi?
<i>Bolchoi also means: great, many</i>
<i>He says: many thanks</i>
<i>Thank you, Bolchoi to you</i>
Won't he let go of my hand?
Can we fill this place up?
Yeah, don't worry
It was a full house with the elections
44 million votes...
divided by...
We'll place it there, OK?
What's this?
The Flag! The banner!
Of the Party convention in Moscow, 1966.
You memorized the elections, Momo?
We had 100% of the votes.
100 % !
A historical moment
A people united for the same cause
An unforgettable event
100%
Nobody ever did better.
I'm running late,
I've have to speed up.
You keep it, Momo.
Keep it.
Go on, go on,...
Back up...
Get busy!
Please help me, my credit card has been blocked
I have to clear a cheque today.
Calm down, everything in it's own time.
But now's the time!
I saved them yesterday!
They went to a russian restaurant, not the Trou Normand.
I had to pay the bill, at 6 a.m.
1636 Euro! For drinks only, they didn't even eat!
If you saved them, like you say
then where are they? Do you hear music?
<i>An unknown Tchaikovsky
"Silence for violin and orchestra"?</i>
Maybe a misunderstanding?
Or a problem translating?
Are you an orchestra or a quartet?
Where is your orchestra, mr Filipov?
I am ravishing to see you.
Don't be deranged.
They will be here very immediately.
They are not french, mister.
Neither german, far from it.
About russians, it's a matter of politeness
to arrive a bit late.
Try to understand, be courtious.
Ivan Gavrilov
You are late!
<i>And also your Spasiba Bolchoi!</i>
Where are they? That's your job.
Where is my orchestra?
Not expensive, caviar! Try it!
How much?
200 euro. Friendly price.
How much? More expensive
than at the supermarket?
No, thanks.
But better, no?
No.
Caviar is finished.
Are you gonna teach me business?
The chinese cell phones,
would have sold in less than 1 hour.
A russian jew selling chinese phones?
That stinks.
That's like a pygmy
selling gefilte fish.
It would be bio but not kosher!
My dear Anna, what a pleasure to see you.
Thank you.
Here's the maestro.
<i>Dobryi den.</i>
Bonjour.
I fondle you warmly.
We're running a bit late
The slavic temperament
Something like that.
Where do we put this?
Next to the other stuff.
OK, boss.
Igor ! Yuri !
Move your ass!
Madam, out of the way.
Why didn't you bring any cell phones, smarty?
I did bring some.
I gave one to every musician to get by customs.
Except for Andreï, Sacha and Ivan
so they don't know.
50 corean cell phones
with unlimited world wide option.
A real bargain!
My son, who taught to do deals like that?
You're a genius, so like me.
We're rich!
There's one problem though,
they won't give them back.
Who? What?
Stupid, call them.
They won't answer.
Give it to me.
Give me the numbers.
They're in there.
Watch out for the door.
<i>Moïse</i>
Guylène, don't they have phones?
Maybe they're in traffic jams.
I phoned the hotel, nobody's returned.
We have to improvise.
How can we improvise?
Tchaikovsky with 3 instruments?
This is silly.
How long do I have to wait?
Don't stop. It's brilliant.
What is your name, mister?
Alexandre Abramovitch Grossman.
Am sorry.
It's very big compliment for me.
Not bravo.
It's very difficult for me.
I'm the least good of the orchestra.
Are you joking?
No really.
Maestro tells me:
"Rehearse, rehearse.
Sacha not good."
The others don't practice.
<i>Me, da.</i>
Me...
need practice a lot...
for good level.
Very true, mademoiselle.
I don't rehearse for people
installing cameras.
Practice kills spontaneity.
No rehearsal whatsoever.
No rehearsal.
We apologize, if you come
for nothing.
but for us spontaneity is important.
Music = spontaneity
You mean the Bolchoi has such capability
You think we are pretentious,
don't you?
Not technique.
Soul!
Spirit
You ask where are the musicians.
They are learning,
finding inspiration in Paris,
City of Light
In musea : Louvre,
Musée Rodin, Centre Pompidou...
Is it not, Sacha ?
- Yes
- Coming through !
Here are my cousins of Romainville.
We are one bassoon short,
One of the hired ones has gone "bad"
Here the police gets too involved.
Put the instruments on the chairs.
Violins there
Celli there
Contrabasses there,
woodwinds up there
Flute next to the cor anglais
Shoes over there.
There's a plug,
start ironing!
Quickly, that's all we have to do.
Oh my god!
How much is rent?
We could do weddings here.
That's enough.
Call Duplessis.
Take it, doll.
I don't steal.
How did you do this?
What do you mean?
Those arpeggios, those harmonics.
By hand.
But which fingering do you use?
I've never seen that style.
Where did you study?
Who is she?
Where is she from, this chick?
What is she on about?
I'm sorry.
I'm confused.
I'm sorry if I caused a scene.
No problem, young lady.
Do we still have dinner tonight?
Are you available?
Yes, isn't it.
We'll meet at 8 o' clock.
You have no transmission rights to this concert.
You understand the word "rights", don't you?
I'm the orchestra sponsor.
Without me, there's no orchestra.
You understand the word "orchestra", don't you?
- Don't start like this.
- Who are you?
I'm the director of the Châtelet.
Never heard about you.
We have an exclusive contract with France TV.
That's your problem.
I already sold the rights to russian TV.
50 million viewers.
The russian president, a personal friend,
will watch the broadcast by satellite.
I invited him to my place
Would you like to be cut off from gaz?
Ask the germans what they think?
Well, them russians...
Let's not stay locked
in discussion.
The contract stipulates we're not responsable
for natural disasters.
Natural disasters?
Like transmissions lost in space
getting picked up by other satellites.
Arriving in other countries, other planets,
that's also natural disasters.
Right, we can't control everything.
Big satellites receiving some music, some pictures...
Agreed, mister Tretiakin?
I couldn't care less.
We got the best musicians.
Don't worry.
They will be back for the concert.
Stop pretending you believe this.
We're just a bunch of has-beens.
What are we doing here?
I shouldn't have brought you.
It's a nightmare.
It's them!
My orchestra!
Sacha, come !
It's your fault too,
you're big and slow.
You want to go back?
C'mon, I'm ready.
If needed, we'll go over each station.
Calm down.
Andreï, Mr Duplessis...
Shut it, I'll do the talking.
In 25 years, I've never seen such unprofessional behaviour.
Do you take me for a fool with your stories
of no rehearsals needed?
M. Duplessis, for us the orchestra...
Enough!
Consider this a warning for you all
You have a contract you're not respecting.
I expect you all 2 hours before the concert
otherwise I cancel everything.
You don't think I will?
I've done it before.
- Has anyone come back?
- Nobody.
The rooms are empty,
no keys in the lobby.
I left a message on each door.
I don't care about your messages!
I saw them on the subway.
Go find them!
I hope you were pretending,
if we cancel we're doomed.
Do you take me for a fool?
All rights are sold: TV, radio, internet, cd, dvd,...
The return of the maestro
playing with Anne-Marie Jacquet
Fantastic!
It's always the same with these russians.
It's psychologic.
They're stubborn donkeys!
You need to hit them on the head
so they will advance.
Fax them the program at the hotel.
Make up a good excuse
in case they don't show up.
I'll get right on it.
Fax this to the Bolchoi right away.
Leonid Dimitrievich, a fax for you.
No faxes! I'm on holiday!
I'll deal with it when I get back from Paris.
To the concert.
To the concert !
Andreï, if you please.
Is it true, you stood up to the regime
to protect jewish musicians?
Not only jews but the entire orchestra?
There was nothing heroic
isn't it.
We had no choice,
difficult time
Complicated.
Complicated?
We lived
didn't we?
This concert
it's like...
confession.
A cry.
In every note there's life.
Notes looking for harmony.
Looking for happiness.
Can I ask something?
Yes.
I was brought up by a very special woman.
Guylène, you saw her at the rehearsal.
She's like a mother to me
and my agent, my manager.
and also my friend,
my only friend.
I never knew my parents.
Excuse me
Please continue
I've looked for my parents
since I was a little girl.
In the streets
everywhere
When I play,
what I would like,
is them watching me.
One second
Just one second.
That would already be magnificent.
Richard and Sophie Jacquet
two brilliant scientists.
He was a biologist and anthropologist
Guylène told me, she was their best friend.
They died when I was only a baby.
They died in his plane,
they crashed in the Alps.
Everything fine?
May I introduce Ivan Tikhomirov,
Igor Oboukhov...
Great musicians.
It was at 22h
They've departed.
They said 22h30.
Ok then
get in the boat.
Why did you choose me?
Me, I've done many times
The Tchaikovsky Concerto
Me...
obsessed
sick, isn't it?
I think with this Concerto I'll see
The ultimate harmony
The summit of music
Perfection.
So, I looked for violin solo.
I found Lea.
Léa Strum !
Brilliant, extra-ordinary
We became great friends.
All good friends in those days,
Lea and Yitzhak, married to her.
We continue to rehearse,
to find.
Not a normal life.
Crazy!
One day,
a friend tells me that Brezjnev
wants to throw out all jewish musicians.
I panic.
Lea's jewish.
Lea and I decide to play
the Tchaikovsky concerto.
Quickly!
I didn't defend jews, Anne-Marie.
Me...
selfish.
Forbidden concerto, crazy dream.
I needed Lea and the jews
to reach harmony.
And then?
June 12, 1980.
<i>Concerto.</i>
You were ready?
No.
Yes. How to know?
Bolchoi Theatre.
Packed house.
Many people.
Journalists from all over the world.
managers, collegues...
<i>Concerto...</i>
begins.
Miracle begins.
Léa...
sublime.
Violin magical.
lifts me and the orchestra
to heaven
very high
We...
soar
We...
public, together
fly to perfect harmony.
<i>But Concerto was stopped in the middle.</i>
We did not reach ultimate harmony.
<i>Brezjnev stopped the Concerto in the middle</i>
to humiliate us in front of public.
Brezjnev cut our wings.
We fell hard.
After that...
all jews thrown out
Léa, Sacha, all...
Could you still live together?
Yes. But all was lost.
I couldn't go on working without them.
What became of Lea?
Léa and Yitzhak did an interview for Radio Free Europe.
Forbidden radio in USSR.
They...
criticized Brezjnev
didn't they?
And then?
Nothing.
Do you want me to replace Lea?
It's not me you're hiring.
I'm not Lea.
You haven't directed in 30 years.
I've never played Tchaikovsky.
Never tried it.
I understand your history, the way you hurt.
But I'm not Lea.
We won't reach ultimate harmony together.
I dreamed of this concert
with you.
You need treatment.
You can't revive the past.
We shouldn't do this concerto together
and thus avoid failure.
Do you want me to go?
Call a cab, please.
Everything will be OK.
So?
Nothing
What happened?
Nothing
We cancel the Châtelet.
- Did you have to drink all that?
- Be nice. Don't yell.
Nobody's yelling.
- How's the vodka?
- It's french.
Imbecile !
All is finished
The concert, Tchaikovsky,
the orchestra, Anne-Marie...
Bang!
Bravo Brezjnev, you won again.
Ira... I was never...
she deserved
another life, kids...
Gimme that letter.
Give it yourself!
Don't you start again!
What happened 30 years ago
wasn't your fault.
I pushed Lea into
this madness.
No! Not true!
She had the same madness
inside as you.
Come...I'm taking you with me.
Guylène, please
I must speak with her.
He drank too much.
He drunk, tell foolishness.
Many emotions for you.
Don't do it, don't cancel. Please.
Concert vital for him.
No concert, he dies.
Kill him.
Please leave, sir.
Guylène!
Let him in.
You have no right.
Andreï, is the best in the world.
Brezjnev...
Career finished.
Honor gone.
The man's a genius.
A genius.
They made him a loser,
a drink...
Drunk!
I'm jew, like...
...Lea and Isaac Strum.
I know.
I don't ask you love Andreï.
Just play violin.
Please.
Come do the concerto.
I think what happened to Mr Filipov
and his friends...
This might sound cruel but
a concert is not psycho-analysis
He's ill.
You ask me to help someone else,
to suffer from the same illness as that poor violin player.
No
It's no.
Goodbye, sir.
And if at the end of concert...
you find your parents?
What are you saying?
Good god!
Music sometimes helps us to grow...
Gives us answers.
We scared
before playing music.
Fear of truth.
I don't understand.
Clarify!
Clear ?
Nothing's clear.
Nothing was ever clear.
I'm just a fool,
done everything wrong in life.
Lost my wife,
my kids,
and I give life lessons to you?
You ask for words,
but words are treacherous
Words are foul.
Only music is pretty.
But music is a prisoner inside of us.
Music...
don't want to leave.
Why?
Sorry to disturb.
Pardon.
Goodbye
Goodbye, Guylène.
What you said,
I cannot put aside
How do you know Guylène?
What do you mean...
<i>at the end of the concert?</i>
<i>You will find your parents?</i>
You jewish?
You don't do sabbat or kippour!
To be called Moise don't make you jewish.
God has at least sent you a fax, didn't He?
You look pale.
Would you like an aspirine?
Miss...
Shut up.
Pardon us...
Goodbye.
Dearest...
Do the concert, play Tchaikovsky
At the end, you'll maybe know
the truth about your parents
Forgive me for having lied to you
all these years
I did it to protect you
to do you good.
Years ago, André Filipov
gave me the annotated score by Lea Strum.
I give it now, for you to have.
Don't look for me, as you read this
I'll be far away.
I love you, Guylène.
<i>Mahler - Symphonie n° 1
Andreï Filipov</i>
<i>Hotel de Paris
hotel lobby...</i>
Mr Grossman please...
<i>Come back! For Lea!</i>
Paris !
I am the Bolchoi !
Tonight, let's not talk about money.
This is Tchaikovsky's moment.
You're in for a treat.
Mister, where's our seats?
51, 52... 53 !
That's 53 ! Who's missing?
Don't worry, they will come.
Viktor and son!
It's they who contacted us.
They will come.
Phone them!
I don't have one anymore,
They took them all.
Straight on, take a left at the square
then another left at the Châtelet.
How can you live in Paris
and not know the Châtelet?
<i>How do you mean
"See you later"?</i>
- I'm just saying "See you later"
- You're going nowhere.
Why? You're there, you're in charge.
In 30 years, i've listened more to Tchaikovsky
than himself and his mother combined.
I know the thing by heart.
Nothing is more important
than this concert!
<u>But there are things more important...</u>
I'm holding a Party meeting...
Let me through!
You came over here
just for your stupid Party Conference?
How many speeches have you held in Moscow?
Wasn't that enough?
I'm here for the members,
for those that still believe in the Party...
in our ideals!
<i>Yes, I remember:
Proletarians, unite...</i>
And today, un-unite
and so on and on...
You're so selfish!
You only think about
yourself and your concert!
Blinded by your ego!
An orchestra is like the world, Ivan.
An entier world!
Everybody comes with
his instrument and his talent.
They unite at a concert
for this ideal
Hoping to produce magic & harmony.
For everyone, that's real communism!
Only during a concert.
Maestro,may I introduce
Raymond Laderac
Pleased to meet you,
I'm awaiting impatiently
your ideas.
He's our most esteemed critic.
Don't be upset, he's always like this.
He hates russian music,
especially Tchaikovsky.
It's gonna be a triumph!
Anne-Marie, it's Olivier.
I'm with Laderac.
He wants to say hi.
PCF!!
Comrades!
The moment has come
Moscow supports us again.
They've sent Ivan Gavrilov.
A real russian leader!
Ivan Gavrilov ? You?!
No! Yes!
So happy you're here!
It's a scandal, criminal!
I couldn't stop them alone!
It's another zionist attack!
It's devine intervention for you to arrive.
Move quickly, Leonid!
Quickly! Before they start!
Camera 1 on me, close up.
Caméra 2 on me, wide view.
Camera 3 focus on my hands.
Camera 4 on my orchestra.
Caméra 5 on my public.
Understood.
Mr Duplessis, I cannot work like this
These people don't want to leave!
I alone am allowed to sell in this place!
Please understand.
The program is included.
Thanks.
This way, quickly!
Gavrilov, open up!
God, show me you exist
perform a miracle.
Guide our troop.
It's not possible...
You do exist!?
<i>Anne-Marie, I haven't told you all.</i>
<i>Because of the interview
on Radio Free Europe,</i>
<i>Léa and Yitzhak</i>
<i>were arrested by the KGB.</i>
<i>They had a baby girl
six months old.</i>
<i>As they saw the KGB arrive</i>
<i>they gave their baby to the neighbour</i>
<i>who took the baby with her</i>
Please take the baby to France.
<i>What could become of </i>
<i>a jewish baby whose parents
were ennemies of the people</i>
<i>sentenced to life?</i>
<i>Irina, Sacha and I</i>
<i>sent her to France right away</i>
<i>with a manager friend</i>
<i>stationed in Moscow.</i>
<i>Léa and Yitzhak
were deported to Siberia</i>
<i>till her dying days</i>
<i>Léa played in her mind</i>
<i>the Tchaikovsky concerto</i>
<i>They called her "the crazy one"</i>
<i>She died
weak and cold</i>

<i>Yitzhak died

<i>Tchaikovsky...</i>
<i>The violin concerto...</i>
<i>It was I</i>

<i>Anne-Marie,</i>
<i>Léa was your mother</i>
<i>A people's ennemy</i>

Maman! Come see!
Daddy's on TV!
He's playing in Paris!
Sacha in Paris ?
