"So Detached From Myself and so Present in The World"
"-  Albert Camus."
(Albert Camus)
French philosopher and writer
"For Henry"
I wasn't good in school
I didn't care for school
Um ... It was an nice socially
Based on my own experience
But I can't just went along ...
I started over in Music Major
I'll be Rock-n-road Star
But that didn't quite worked out.
In 1985
The journey of hurricane during the Gloria
I was taking an train into the city to work
I was ... I gone to work and I was on
the phone with my brother-in-law
who ... he had just started teaching
He said that he was off from school
Now, wait a second,
You off from school for hurricane,
I am going to the city ....
To work in the Office building?
Its an pretty good game, right.
My mother was an teacher
I knew it without an shadow of a doubt
From my early childhood
By the one job, I would never
do as become an teacher
Ever never I would take the
top-cards on a "turn plate"
I'll be seperated anything
Rather than become an teacher
And I decided to be a teacher because I
wanted to do something with my life besides
what I was doing which I was driving a truck
For a company and,
And decided that I want to the better for myself,
so I started teaching a little bit, at the acting school
I was at age of 37
A friend of mine from the College
His aunt was the ...
Principle of the "all-girls" in
the city school in New York
In New Jersey
They were desperate for teachers
So I thought "Great",  I can do this for a year
It will keep my father for
making me an job for prudential.
And I figured it out what I wanted to do
Well they called up for enter an interview
And I have to get an job, and
In a Junior High school in Queens
And I ended up ...
I started it - my... what
was now reached 30 years
Most of the teachers here at one point
They believe
They could make the difference
I know how important it is
After guidance and to have ...
Someone help you to understand
the complexities of the
world that we living, they didn't really
have that ... growing up
I am money
I change hands like a dollar bill
its been robbed by the lab
I am geneis premium and cry for love
with volume
But the tears were offer myself
And that's all went wrong
* Phone ringing *
* Beep *
Hello, Robe, its Dead Mathias here
I'm sick and won't be coming today
alright.

I have to school today, alright.
Day school gone down at the
state for last three years
Don't pretend you know the game,
You "ink-mark" my school and the chance

Children deserve an education

Perhaps I used to it
I wish to be that strong
It doesn't take that strength, Meredith

anybody in the classroom
And then make that into next period
"She used to be an sweet girl"
"She never seems to be
satisfied with her life..."
"And why should she have been"
"An mother of mine gave her
everything she needed ... "
"So why she become so angry?"
"So miserable, so mean for all of a sudden"
"We don't know."
"Frankly, it doesn't reflected on us."
"We were good parents"
"But still, she will repay us for all we've done"
"Like killing herself"
"Stupid and selfish Child"
"Now she will never get into Princeton"
(Princeton is an U.S. well-known university)
No name.

you can't think in this place
Cannot make new memories
Thank you
- You alright?
- What?
- You see me?
- You see me standing here?
Yes, I see you here
Oh God, its so re-linkness, thank you.
" Carol, there is no way for us to do this, I spoke with the
Super-attendant, its agree to let you out for the rest of year "
" It is where it is, take your pension
and fill out your flabulous ... "
" Send greetings to Bastards ..."
I am Chairman before. If I am Chairman,
I just want to tell someone to fuck off.
I think I am sick
- Why?

I mean the whole thing is fuck
Whole thing is fuck, is not?
What's up, Dr.Parker?
Can we get over It? I have
got other things to do.
Well, what are your plan for after High School
ever since you will not go to University?
I don't know
Hanging out with my boyfriend,
designing an modelling shit ...
- Be my friends' band (music)

Do you know what they said?
Fail, Fail, Fail
- F, F, F
- F, F, F yah
You know what that means?
Its mean you don't care
You're brilliant.
Can I go now?
Oh god, you are an shallow disgusting creature.
You want to know the truth?
One, you not gonna be in an Band,
Or an Model Missy, because you have no ambition.
With no skills, you will gonna be the 80% of
the U.S. workforce for minimum wages job
Which mean the way you living
for the rest of your life
Until they replaced by computers.
- I don't care
- Two, ....
The only talent you ever have
is getting men to fuck you.
Your life will be become an part of pain
Now, can you won't say it again
Not for one more day,
not one more hour!
It will get worse, much worse!
Everyday I came in this office and I
listened your kids to shit-off yourself!
Its so easy to be careless, it takes
curse and courage to take cares
None of you have any of these qualities.
- Get out!  Just get out! Get out!
- Fuck You!!
* Bang - shut the door *
- I am totally burn out
- No you were not.
- I am.
- I mean I don't know how you make it through the day.

I mean, there are lot of rumors there.
Oh come on, I don't dig these things,
I can be an Master of these parents
I will be help them out to throw
the fucking kids out of the window
Come on, you're the best.
I'll tell you my opinion, the
worst thing about this job
Is that nobody say thank you
- No
- No
I'm here to say thank you
Your doing the job, none of us could do
None of us.
- Grace
- Have I ever I told you that you're the only person
That I have to talk to
- Hi Henry
- What happened?
They called to your house
- Your grandfather felt his chest pain
- Then?
Doctors said his condition is stable
He doesn't have a lot of time
- I am so sorry Henry
- How long ...
Have you been here?
Since this morning, I didn't
know how to get an hold of you?
I don't know where you work
You are having a whole day with him?
Hello, grandpa
I am still hanging in there, as I see
Hey sweetheart, your mother
has visited me today
Did you seen her?
- No
- I told her I was afraid  to leave you
... But she promised
- That she would look after you
- Sure, she means that all the time
Patricia tell me that
You've forgiven me, haven't you?
- What do you need to forgiven me, daddy?
- Those things
You know, the things I did
All you have to do is
- Always take care of me
- Why did you afraid of me?
No, daddy, not
I know how you get sometimes
you get little mixed up
You feel responsible for the
things that you didn't do
So I was the one who hurted you?
No Sir, that wasn't you
I wish this wasn't true
Patricia, I always love you
Daddy, you can feel free to
leave, when are you be ready
Do you know that?
Thats okay.
There is nothing to fear
Come on
Let's leave from here
Is Patricia be your mom?
What happened to her?
She left a while ago
You mean she died?
How did she dead?
My father left when I was a kid,
I don't really remember him
Its always the three of us,
Mother and Grandpa and I together
In this house
I've found her... on the foor
... She was taking enough pills
And Grandpa at that moment,
seriously kinda of lost ...
* Tape written - For Henry *
I sat with my grandpa's bench and
we watched her to came and go in
How old were you?
Seven, I am kinda not for sure, i think my
mother was young when something happened
- With my grandpa
- Were you afraid of it?
No
Did she ever say anything to you?
No
But looking back on it, I think she
protected me on her own way
How?
She made me locked my door at night
The park is now empty in bare,
and we feel ... ashamed about it
The jungle jam slide and
swing and roost together
I also terribly alone now
Where did the ... all children gone
Didn't they know the park needed them?
The child's intelligent heart can flatten
the death of many dark places
I cannot find any kinda
delicated moment of attachment

Man with no face, in a empty room
Is this how you see me, Meredith?
I don't know how I see you
This is just how I feel in your situation
Don't you ever think about who is
going to teach you from the outside

You always seem so sad

Meredith, I am sorry.
- What were you doing?
- What?
What are you doing?

It is inappropriate to be in here
alone with that young girl
It is inappropriate, she needed
someone to talk with to
- What do you think I'm doing? lady
- I don't know what I am doing.
"Just make me close."
What do you think I am fucking provert?
Is that what you insalivating?
She needed someone to talk to her
- Why would you touching her?
- I wasn't touching her
"Its alright my dear"
"Patricia"
I'm not ... not a sick old man!
Is that the way you thinking of me?
Is that what you think?
I just wanted to help her!
- Get out! Excuse me! Excuse me!

Fucking to your fucking judgement!
Hello, no he's not home.
Hello Mr. Barthes

to have some papers downstairs
I need you to take care of them
I am sorry.
I wish things would be different
I tried, you know, fuck
the things it is ... we all
We all have problems with all
the things we dealing with
Somedays would better than others, Some days
we're not so great, somedays we have limited spaces
For others.
Good day, sit down, have a breakfast.
Want some milk?
These kids need something else
They don't need me.

- Yeah, I'm not hungry
- You know, you can't keep living on the street.
- No I am not, I mean I here staying with you.
You can not stay here with me.

You're the only family that I ever have
Well I can't be your family.
I can't give you what you needed
- You have to understand, you should be ...
- You are good ...
And gentle ...
You are the most guy
I love you Henry
- Come in, hi

Hello there

You are all that I have, please...
- Don't let me go
- You should go, sorry

Well ... I does feel awful for her
- For who?
- For our school
It may sound strange but I always
felt that the school has its spirit
Its not just an budgetful
buildings, bu they're alive.
I just can't understand
where are all the parents?
I don't know
It was in my room for two hours and I saw only
one parent, where are they? Where is everybody?
- We don't know
- Its impossible.
No annoying, its slience, no bombs
Doesn't happen that way
Starting the whisper, then nothing
We had an music once, hadn't we?
Yes, we did
Do you remember that night, where
we have two parents at a time?
And then we have more and the
many more waiting in the waiting list
And halls were filled with joys and
celebrations. Now, its nothing.
I remember the things passed.
I actually felt quite at home
No parents
I thought about how its appropriate,
Its like - A moment of the insight
The reality of the fucking
problem in the first place
Some of us believe that
we can make a difference
And then sometimes when we wake up
And we realize we failed.
* Phone ringing*
* Beep - recording machine *

" - I won't stand that, Dad! "
" - Paint something more cheerful ..."
" We have to pay us our lives ..."

" We all gonna be okay "
- Good morning
- Good morning
Before we take class
I want to tell you that ...
today will be my last day with you
You will have a permanent teacher on Monday.
- Where will you going, Mr. Barthes?
- I will go to another school
- We will miss you, man. I'll fuck with you.
- Yeah?
All those teachers there in
this place ... they're "dickies"
Don't you get tired of
moving around all the time?
It's my job works, well I was coming
in here for a period of time ...
So you don't have to turn in yourself a lot here ...
and then you will have an permanent teacher come in ...
And I leave
"Attention to all teachers, this is an special
announcement from the Principle's Office. "
" There will be all faulties meeting today
during the nutrients (meal time)"
" Students' nutrients period won't  be extended "
" For ten minutes, thank you."
I invited you here today to
discuss, the status things
I know they wasn't ...
I know that there isn't ...
- I am sorry ...
- We all need something
To extract from the complexity and reality
More or less to think about
where they came from?
More or less to think about the struggle that
it takes to become somebody to get out of ...
... to get out of the ...
The sea of painful,
we all have to get out of it.
- Hello Meredith
- Hello
Haven't seen you in class lately?
Where have you been?
- Baking
- Oh I see
- Yah
- I am happy to see you because it is my last day
How ironic!
Listen, I was thinking,
I bought this for myself
Maybe you could make better use of it.
- I like that, its best
- You can have that one
It's mine
But, can you have this one?
- It's better for you anyway
- Thanks
I am sorry.
If I have hurted you in any way, I um ...
- I know that its tough right now, for you, but its not gonna your wish ...
- Goodbye Mr. Barthes.
Goodbye Meredith.
They say that suicide is a permanent
solution to the temporary problem
How well would you know?
My name is Meredith and
I want to kill myself
Meredith
No
Henry
Things would gonna be fine.
Things would gonna be fine.
Things would gonna be okay.
We have such a responsibility to guide
a young so that they don't end up ...
Falling apart.
Falling by the way side.
Becoming insignificant.
I realized something today
I'm not a person you are,
you shouldn't be here.
I am not here
You may see me, but I am empty.
Failing, we failing
Failure does have sense of mean,
we left, everyone went down.
Including ourselves.
And I am walking an Hall way to the class.
How many of you have ever felt the
weight of presence down on your chest?
I have.
* Rise hands*
Everyone?  Well, poem wrote about
these things over 100 years ago
So as we read
We can see that the house of
Russia is not nearly an old ...
The crapping castle there be repaired.
It is also an state of existence.
" During the whole whole dark dark soundless day "
" In the autumn of that year, when
the clouds are pressively low in heaven "
" I have been passing alone on the horse's back "
" Through the Singletary nearly track in the country"
" That lane found myself that is
 shaved to be evening dawn"
" Was in the view of mountain
Connery House of Russia"
" I know not how it was "
" With the first scream of the building, I
sensibly in suffering gloomy probated in my spirit "
" I looked for poem for some
blank scape for domain "
" Poem for beathe walls, Poem for
white trunks of decayed trees "
" With the other depression souls "
" There wasn't an iceness "
" A sinking."
" Seeking an Heart "
" Detachment "
