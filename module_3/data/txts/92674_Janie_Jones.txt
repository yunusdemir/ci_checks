I think we're almost there, guys, I think.
I just talked to the venue. They say it's totally sold out.
Almost.
Any hot pockets left?
God.
It's going to be great, man. Cheer up.
- My landlord's been calling me.
- Yeah?
I can't wait anymore. I need to borrow some money.
- I can't give you more money.
 - I'm not asking you to give it to me.
I'm going to borrow it. I'm going to pay you back.
 Fine, I'm going to fix it.
Oh, come on, mom.
Do you have to do that here, really?
Where else am I going to do it?
 Janie, go get $10 out of my purse, okay?
Pay for the gas.
I really don't see why you have to look like a hooker to introduce me.
God!
I don't look like a hooker.
I just haven't seen Ethan in a really long time and I really wanted to just look nice for him.
That's all.
[singing] Ladies are in the house
[all singing] Ladies of the eighties are in my blouse!
Hello, Little Rock!
Okay. What?
- What the hell is going on?
 - Someone is here to see Ethan.
- No one is allowed to see the band before the show, you know that.
- It's not a fan.
 -What do you mean? Spit it out!
Shit.
- What's going on?
 - Seriously. We need to talk in private.
Seriously, no. I don't want to. Because every time you say, 'Let's talk in private'
it's some kind of shitstorm and I want to ride this one out with the boys.
And with Iris.
- Spill it.
 - Give me two minutes, okay?
It's either going to be bad news about me or it's going to be bad news about the band.
- Either way, we're a family.
 - That's really nice of you to say.
- Except for Billy.
 - Beautiful, beautiful.
One, two, three.
Okay, but I'm on record: I tried.
Someone is in a bad mood today.
- Hello
 -Hi.
Who is this?
What can we do for you, lady?
Ethan, it's Mary Ann.
Shit!
Oh, my God. I can't believe you don't recognize me.
I guess it's been a few years maybe.
 Oh, my God. It's been 13 years.
It's Mary Ann Jones! God!
Do you remember we hung out when you were touring?
 That's great.
I don't...
- I don't really remember you.
 - Can I just talk to you?
- For five minutes, by yourself?
 - Everyone wants your time, man!
-Shut up.
 - No! Sorry.
-Let's talk about it here because we're a family.
We are a family and this is my girlfriend.
We go on in five minutes so what do you want?
I think I should talk to you in private.
No, I don't think so.
- You got the stage.
 - Okay.
Okay, I don't know how to say this so I'll just say it.
Ethan, you have a daughter.
She is 13 years old.
Her name is Jane.
But a lot of people call her Janie.
 Her name is Janie Jones.
- Like the song by The Clash.
- Shut up, man.
Okay. I don't...
- Sorry, what is your name again?
 - My name is Mary Ann.
Mary Ann...
What do you want?
Money?
Because don't let the bus fool you, I ain't got shit.
I don't want your money. I need help.
I have to get myself cleaned up and I need
I need somebody to take care of her because I can't.
What, are you buying this?
Look, lady, I'm sure the shit has really hit the fan in your life.
But don't you think this is just a tiny bit manipulative to come in here and play
'pin the tail on the daddy' with me?
Oh, God. I don't know what I was thinking.
Okay, guys. Five minutes.
What, you believe her?
I don't have a kid!
I've never even met this woman.
The jury is still out, man.
- How are you doing, sweetie?
 - I'm good, thanks.
- Want another soda?
 - No, thank you. I'm all right.
- Hey, did you talk to him? I did.
 - What did he say?
- He is so excited to see you.
 - Really?
Hey, mom, you want to go upfront?
I can't see.
I'm going to wait back here.
You go.
- Are you sure?
 - Yeah, totally! Go, go!

Mom?
911, emergency.
- I saw your kid in the front row.
 - She has his eyes.
- Shut the fuck up, she's not my kid.
- I don't have a kid.
 - What, what'd I say?
Was that necessary?
Thanks, dude.
Technically, she could be your kid, man.
Technically, she could be anyone's kid.
- But she bears a striking resemblance.
 - What?
- What?
- What?
- What?
- Say what?
- Did you say something?
 - I did not.
No.
- This is funny.
 - Have fun with this.
It's fucking hilarious.
Oh, don't go away mad.
Is that him in the black jacket and tie?
- Yeah.
 - All right.
How y'all doing?
Which one of y'all is Ethan?
- That's me.
 - Mind if I have a word with you in private?
- I don't remember meeting this woman.
 I'm supposed to believe that this is...
This is my kid?
- I don't buy it.
 - If you ask me, she takes after you quite a bit.
- Now, how well did you know the mother?
 That's legit, by the way.
I think she came on tour with us for a bit.
- It was a long time ago, man.
 I barely knew her.
You're going to make this difficult, ain't you?
- This is crazy man.
 It seems to me, seeing that...
- You <i>are</i> the father.
 She ought to go with you.
- We're on tour.
 This is no life for a little girl.
Normally, I'd agree with you.
 But here is the deal.
 I called this in. The mother is nowhere to be found.
Her home phone, her cell phone has been shut down.
I ran her record. Recent arrests, possession.
A good sized stash of methamphetamine.
 Missed her court date, got a warrant on her.
Now...
She may turn up and she may sort all that out.
I mean, God, let's hope so. Right?
But all<i> that</i> ain't real good for this little girl.
She must have other family.
Girl said she doesn't know any other relatives that are alive.
 We'll check it out.
Hi Is everything okay?
I was just telling your friend, I'm sorry, what is your name?
- Iris.
 - Iris.
- Beautiful name.
- Thank you.
Iris, I was just telling your friend, Ethan, that we have ourselves a situation.
- What's that?
 - Look.
- I don't think that she is my kid.
 - If you don't take her...
- I have to call family services then she goes in to state care.
Until they place her in some foster home.
And then, there's you.
Your name is on that birth certificate.
- You have a kid?
 - No, no.
- I don't have a kid.
 - If I have to call this in right now...
- Y'all ain't going nowhere.
 You'll stay here, in town, until the hearing.
And if the court orders a paternity suit, which they <i>will</i>
And it's <i>you.</i>
 You got problems.
Deadbeat dad.
It's a big shock, I know.
- This is not happening.
- Ethan, you're not thinking about not taking her?
No, I'm thinking about what's best for the kid.
- I don't think I can do this.
 - Okay but you <i>do</i> have a choice.
You ain't gotta go with him.
 I can bring in the folks from Family Services.
But I ain't sure you're going to like that.
So let's just say 'hi' to the fella.
And if you change your mind, I'm going to be right there.
Is that okay?
- Yeah, okay.
 - Okay.
Let's give them a minute.
Jane Jones, this is Ethan.
Ethan, this is Jane.
- Hey.
 - Hey.
So I guess your mother took off?
Aw, man.
[profanity] I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say that.
It came out.
- Do you play?
 - Yeah.
- How long?
 - I don't know, a couple years, I guess.
Well...
Look, I know this is kind of a weird deal
 but why don't you just come with us?
Until your mom calls, shows up or whatever?
Yeah, okay.
You ever been on a tour bus before?
Well...
This one sucks.
- Hi, I'm Iris.
- Hi.
You want a tour of the bus?
No, I'm okay, thanks.
Guys, there's a kid on the bus.
Sorry, man, but what the hell are we supposed to do?
- Not get high?
 - Billy, don't put that out.
Dude, this is so [profanity]
You can't have a kid on tour with us.
It's bad luck. It's like having a woman on a ship.
- She's not a woman, she's a kid.
 - Iris is a woman.
- So, what's your point?
 - And this isn't a ship.
Okay fine, then it's good luck.
- Gil, open the window.
 - It's jammed.
I better hide my porn.
Hey.
I have someone here who wants to meet the rest of the band.
- This is Chuck, he is our drummer.
 - Janie Jones, I like your name.
- Hi, Chuck.
- This is Dave, he plays bass.
- Hey, how are you doing?
 - This is Billy, our lead guitar player.
- He used to tour with Ashley Simpson.
 - Hi.
- All right, maybe we should hang out in the front lounge for a little bit.
 - Yeah.
Why are you shaking me over this?
 It's only for a few more days.
That's not the point.
- Yeah.
 - Oh, really?
I don't know why I'm the bad guy.
 I'm just trying to do the right thing.
- Oh, come on. That's bullshit.
 - Whatever! It was a long time ago!
She's probably some junkie tramp.
- [profanity]
 - What?
- What?
 - I think she just heard us.
Janie?

 You know, back there.
 I didn't mean to upset you.
 I don't know what you're talking about.
I didn't recognize that song.
 Did you write that?
- Yeah.
 - I guess so.
- It was good.
 - Thanks.
We're having a sound check a little bit later on.
You should come.
- Yeah?
 - Yeah, just come and hang out.

Oh, really? Is that what I'm doing? I'm grinding the temple like a fucking tweaker? You need to chill out you fucking asshole.
Chuck, hey.
- Sorry.
 - It's okay.
- Let's just play.
 - Please.
- What was that all about?
 - Nothing, my dear, nothing.
Just band drama.
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure. Go ahead.
Did you know that your mother was planning this?
She told me that she had a plan.
That she had talked to him already.
Ethan told me that you play.
- Yeah, sort of.
 - Well, he didn't say 'sort of'.
 He said that you had a real talent, coming from a guy like that?
- that means that you must be very, very good.
 -Really?
Yes.
So when you get some songs together, like a demo, send them to me. Okay?
- You want to hear my songs?
 - If they are any good, I would love to.
Do you know this girl, what's her name, Miley Cyrus?
She's going to be a billionaire before she's 18.
So you're in the right age group.
 By the age of 20, it's all over.
Here, send them to me. That's me there.
- Okay.
- Right?
Good.

Hey! We have arrived, my troubled troubadours!
Come on, college town!
USA.
Get up, come on. Come on!
Did you hear back from Universal about the publishing?
No, sadly, no.
But I'm sure we'll make some good money off the door tonight.
And t-shirts!
T-shirts? Are you fucking kidding me?
Fucking t-shirts.
- Hi
- Jesus.
Hey.
Are you excited about the show tonight?
- Yeah, really excited about it.
 - Are you all right?
Come on, let's go.
Ethan! Ethan! Ethan!
[slurred] Tonight is a very special night.
This band has been together for six years.
I spend a lot time on the road,
 I spend a lot of time playing music.
I spend a lot of time getting loaded.
I fell in love with that girl over there.
So, you can imagine my surprise...
When today I find out...
that my boy, Billy
has been working my girl behind my back.
 Yeah, it's true.
I'm fucking out of here.
- Where are you going, buddy?
- Fuck you!
- I'm talking to you, Brutus.
- What?
I'm talking to you!
You steal my fucking lady....
But not enough to deal with the fucking consequences?
Shit!
Stop! Stop!
Chuck, a little fucking help here?
They can kill each other for all I care.
- Unbelievable! Stand up.
- You're fired.
I'm fired? That's great!
That''s fucking hilarious. Fuck you.
Asshole.
Come on, let's do this later.
No, we're not going to do this later!
 We're going to do this now!
- Wake up.
 - What the fuck?
What the fuck are you doing?
- Where are we?
 - We just arrived in 'Doucheville'.
- This is your stop.
 - No, seriously. Where are we?
Philosophically speaking, I'd say we've arrived at a crossroads.
- The label dropped the band.
- They killed the tour, man.
What?
- What are you talking about? Why?
- Why? Dave, want to take this one?
No. Let me.
 'Why did they kill the tour?'
Let me see if I can't recreate their decision.
Upon viewing the youtube video of you starting a rob room brawl on stage,
and then walking out on your remaining 2,000 fans,
 powers that be got together
and said, "Wait a minute, this guy is actually ridiculous!"
And also, there is no more margin in this business because
 these idiots don't sell albums anymore!
While that bullshit might play for Radiohead, throwing good money
at this used up has-been is probably not such a good idea!
And also, it's just fucking plain embarrassing!
All those in favor of dropping the Ethan Brand Experiment?
Fuck.
This bus is going back to New York tonight.
So we can either hitch a ride or we can continue the tour on our own.
What do you say?
- Where is Iris?
Are you fucking joking?
- She went back to L.A, man.
 - Continue sleeping.
No problem.
Do you need anything?
- Are you comfortable?
- Yes
Okay.
I have to talk with Sloan
about some business stuff.
Okay.
- Hang out.
 - Yeah.
- Watch TV.
- Right.
I'll be back.
Just let me work on them, all right?
Because they know you just lost part of your band.
You got dropped and now this thing with Youtube.
It's not being very helpful to this situation.
- Play it again.
 - What?
- Just play it!
 - I'm not playing it again!
- You're going to freak out.
 - I'm not going to freak out.
- Yes, you are.
 - I'm not going to freak out, I promise.
All right. No yelling.
I am not.
[over speakers] But not enough to deal with the fucking consequences?
Stop! Stop!
Chuck, help me out here.
Fuck!
I thought we had a deal, man.
I look like a fucking dickhead.
Just don't let them cancel SXSW. (South by Southwest)
What?
- We need that frickin' gate.
 - Yeah, we need it.
Okay, okay. Yeah.
Relax.
What are we going to do about her?
She's gotta go, man!
Back to her mom.
She's a kid, I can't be responsible for her.
She can't hear me!
All right.
Where you going?
I need some air.
Sloane, don't make me fucking drink alone.

[singing in distance]
What are you doing messing with ancient folk songs?
- What do you mean?
 - I mean, that song is like a hundred years old.
Shouldn't you be listening to Jonas Brothers or Miley Cyrus or some shit like that?
- My grandfather was a fan.
- Your granddad had good taste.
- Let me see that?
 -Sure.
Here.
- Where's the Joker Brigade?
 - They said they were going to go talk some shop.
I think they went to that bar over there, y'know, check out the local talent.
It's kind of beat up but I like her.
 She's got character.
You look like shit.
Thank you.
You tell the truth.
 I like that.
- Shall we?
 - Where?
- To 'yon Quickie Mart.
 -Sure, let me put this away.
No, no. Bring it.
This is a song that I wrote when I was about 18.
- Really?
- It's one of the first songs I wrote.

I'm tired of getting hit in the back of the neck with shit pellets.
Okay, so, you don't want to know that Chuck and Dave
are loading up the van and heading back to New York?
What?
- Here comes Dr. Shitstorm.
 -Just be cool, I'll talk to him.
Stoic, controlled, surgical.
We're leaving, that's it.
What the fuck is this?
You're just going to sneak off like a couple of pussies and leave me and the little girl here
here in the middle of nowhere?

Let's everybody try to be adult about this, okay?
Eth, we're moving on, buddy. It's time.
You need to work through some shit and we need to not be around to wait on you to do that.
Come on, guys, this is fucking crazy.
We've been together way too long to be doing this.
Yeah. Exactly.
Chuck?
- Stop. Stop.
 - Ow, fuck!
[profanity]
Shit, I didn't mean to...
I'm sorry, man, I'm sorry.
 I didn't mean to do that.
I love you.
I love you like a brother, man.
That's why we're leaving.
 Because if I don't, I'm going to kill you!
- Okay. C'mon.
- We're going.
I feel like I handled that really badly.
Don't call me, man.
Hey, are you okay?
- Ethan?
- What?
- Are you all right?
 - Yeah.
- Yeah, I'm good.
 - You sure?
Yeah.
That car smells like feet.
Nothing a little fresh air won't fix.
This is not a good idea.
 I think you guys should come back to Chicago with me.
- It's too much to handle on your own, man.
- What am I, 16?
I need these shows.
If I'm going to play SXSW solo.
I can handle this.
I need to borrow some money.
Well...
This is all I got, man.
I'm tapped out. You take that.
-Okay?
 - I'm going to pay you back every penny.
I promise.
Do not worry about me.
I'll be fine.
You better stay in touch.
 - Okay.
- All right? Here.
You already gave this to me.
[indistinct]
I don't know what that means.
But thank you.
- Call me when you get to Omaha.
- Will do.
You take care of each other!
- Officer Dickerson?
 - That's me.
It's Ethan Brand. We met last week with that little girl?
I was wondering if you managed to track down her mom yet?
- Sorry, not a thing.
 - Well, I don't get it.
She said that she was going into rehab.
Yep, well that's what junkies say.
 Everything okay?
- I don't think that I'm the best person for this.
 - At the moment? You're the only person for it.
I got to go.
I'll call you back.
- Who was that?
- Some record label idiots.
We have to hit it.
We have to be at the venue by 8.
 We still got to find a place to crash.
Thank you.
- The shower isn't half bad.
 - I'll take a rain check.
- Suit yourself.
 - So, anyways.
- When did you get your first tattoo?
 - Seventeen.
Really?
 Which one?
-That one.
 - Who's that?
I got it out of a book.
Some hottie I saw a picture of.
I got that first one just to see my mom freak.
What did she do?
- She freaked!
 - Did she ground you?
- No.
- What? No punishment?
Not unless you call a lifetime of
resentment and psychotherapy punishment.
She was so disgusted with me,
 she went to Italy with her boyfriend the next day.
It sounds just like my mom. Except, y'know, swap Italy
for some piece of shit biker bar.
Hah!
Let's do this thing!

How about you keep the screaming

And then you can make whatever kind of strange noises you want.

You're going to go ahead and apologize to Mary Alice.
- Go on, now.

How about letting go of my dad?
Come on. please?
 Let him go.

- Thanks.
- So, can I play you guys a song?
- Sure!

- That your little girl?
 - Hey.
You got some lungs on you, girl.
 What's your name?
- Janie. Janie Jones.
- Why don't you two come up to my office?
The guy dragged me off the stage by my [profanity] underpants.
Forget about that.
 I want to talk about a booking.
- Janie, can you go get my things?
 - Wait, what kind of booking?
I wanna bring you in here as a father/daughter act.
What? No way, that is flipping awesome.
 - Janie, please just go
- We would love to do the show.
- Janie, go pack up my stuff.
Fine, just keep your pants on.
That's some kid you got there, Ethan.
 - Forget about it, okay?
I'm not doing a show with a kid.
 I've got enough problems.
I don't need my career turning into some kind of side show.
It's for half a show tonight.
Oh, man. Give me a fucking break!
Those shit-kicking bar flies started the whole thing.
 You know that.
Those shit-kickers keep my lights on.
I like you, Ethan.
I like the music.
I think my Sunday night audience would
really dig seeing you and your kid play.
I give you all $400 cash and and 20% of the door. A good crowd.
A 50 minute set. There is one other act.
All right, 50 minutes.
Hey, what's up?
 -Hi.
I like your music.
- Thanks.
 - She's 13, you little creep.
Beat it.
Let's go.
- See you later.
 - Later.
Come on.
Go feast on the flesh of someone your own age.
- So when did you get so paternal?
 - When you became my business partner.
- What, no way, seriously?
 - Yeah, seriously.
- This is a one time thing.
 - Thank you!
- Are you hungry?
- I'm actually starved.
I saw an all night burger joint on the way in.
It starts, it's just G and C on the way in but there's a little riff.
And then a G sharp.
- I don't have to do that, right?
 - No, you just play the G and the C.
There's a C minor in the bridge.
But I'll nod at you or something.
- Okay.
- Right.

- Hi
 - Hey, Janie.
Girls, this is Janie Jones.
- Hey, Janie.
 - Hi.
Aren't you a little young to be in here?
Aren't you a little old to be wearing white?
She's feisty, I like her.
The Janie is very talented.
 She'll play a couple of songs with me tonight.
Couldn't find any backup singers your own age?
Yeah, I'm actually not a backup singer.
 He's my dad.
Go in and check on our gear and stuff.
 I'll be over there in a second.
She's not really my kid.
This is my cell.
 Give me a buzz after the show.
Nice to meet you.
Have a good night.
I hope you enjoy the show.
- Thanks.
 - You know, I don't see why you have to drink so much.
before you go on.
Hey, thanks for blowing my wrap.
- You mean with the cougars of the Plain states?
 - They weren't cougars.
Yes, they were.
Five minutes.
- Five minutes.
- Okay.

Thank you. Thank you.
Why tune up backstage when you can tune up in front of an audience?
Whoo!
I smell feet!
I want to introduce you to a young girl.
She is very talented.
 She's going to sing a couple of songs with me.
Her name is Janie Jones.
She's like that girl, what's the name of that girl you were talking about?
- Molly.
- That.

 [raucous laughter]
Stop it!
Are you okay?
Drop your head, sir.
Call Sloan.
He'll take care of it.
Oh, God. I can't do it.
I can. I can do this.
 I can do this.
Oh, shit!
- I wanna make my phone call.
 - You already had your phone call.
Yeah, but it went to voicemail and it really doesn't count.
[deepened voice] Hi, my friend was arrested tonight and I would like to bail him out.
Turn around, face the officer.
Strip.
Oh, man. Can't I just keep my clothes on, please?
"Man?" What, you have an attitude problem?
- You have an attitude problem?
 - No.
Strip.
Sloane, it's Janie Jones and I really need your help.
Ethan got himself arrested and I need to bail him out.
I really need you to call me because I don't know what to do.
Please call me.
 I'm at a hotel right now.
It's 508-555-0755.
Room 20. Please, please call.
Thanks, bye.
Sloan!
Sorry. Sorry. No.
Five hundred dollars?
No, no. That's not a problem at all.
Yeah.
9 AM?
 Okay.
Okay, I'll be there.
 Bye.
- May I help you, little lady?
- I spoke with someone last night named Gil?
My friend Ethan Brand was arrested and I'm here to bail him out.
You should take a seat.
 We'll get into some paperwork.
Is that going to take a long time?
 He's been in there all night.
- I sort of want to get him out.
 - Well, that depends on how fast you can write.
I'm sorry.
I was so scared they might hurt you in there.
I'm okay.
I didn't know what to do so I called Sloane but he didn't answer.
- Yeah, I know.
 - So, I pawned your guitars.
- What?
- Well, don't get mad at me.
- I'm friggin' 13, there's not a lot of options.
 - Yeah, I know, I know.
- Plus, you owe like $100 and $60 for the motel room.
 - I know, I know.
You rock.
Let's get the hell out of here.
- How did you get here, did you take a taxi?
 - What? No way, I drove our car.
- You've been driving?
 - Yeah! And I'm totally good at it now too.
At first, I was scared.
Okay, okay. I appreciate your initiative and the candy spirit
but the driving thing has to end now.
- No, I'm good! I'm really good!
 - Give me the keys!
- Come on.
 - Keys! Non-negotiable!
It's ridiculous, fine.
How the hell did you figure out how to get me out of there?
Well, I mean, I guess I'd have to give credit to my mom for getting in so much trouble with the law.
- And with Duane "Dog" Chapman.
- Who's that?
Bounty hunter?
 It's a reality show on A&E.
- It's so cool, no?
 - Okay.
Okay, let's have the bad news.
 How much to get my gear out?
Look, it's not like I tried to get you a better deal.
 The guy was just so...
- What's the damage?
 - A thousand bucks to get the guitars back.
Sorry.
It's not your fault.
Sorry.
It's not your fault.
I'm the drunken lout.
I'm going to deal with this.
- What are you going to do?
 - I'm going to call Sloane.
- Where's my phone?
- I don't know.
What do you mean you don't know?
 It was with my stuff in the green room.
No, it wasn't I got everything out of the green room.
 - You looked in my bag?
- Yup, many times.
 - In the cases?
Shit.
You know what you remind me of, guys?
Hold on a minute, I've got to take this.
Hello?
Yeah, I'll accept the charges.
Hey, hey. Ethan?
 How are you...what?
What are you talking about?
 What message?
- I never got a fucking message, man.
 - I was in fucking jail, Sloane.
Jail! With steel bars.
and evil fucking people who steal shit and murder people
You know who bailed me out?
 Not you!
Not my manager and my friend who, by the way, didn't pick up the phone!
Do you know who did it?
 Janie did it, Sloane.
Janie Jones. She hocked my guitars to get me out of jail.
Wow, wow.
Yeah...'wow!'
So now, I've got no gear and almost no money.
 - So...
- I need you to wire me some cash.
 - I can't, man.
- It's just two grand.
 - I can't. I don't have it.
- Of course, you do.
 - No, I don't have it, man.
Okay, a thousand.
I don't have it.
 I'm serious!
That is bullshit!
 You can't spare a thousand dollars?
Even if I had the money, I can't bail you out!
Okay? I'm sorry, I'm tapped out, man.
All right, whatver.
 Don't worry about it.
Chicago! Oh, my God!
 That's crazy, I've been waiting to go to a big city for ever!
Don't get too excited because we're not going to stay very long.
We're just going long enough to pick up some money.
then we got to turn around and pick up our gear then we got four days to get by SXSW.
What? That's crazy.
Can you just get the person that's going to give us the money to wire it?
- No, I can't.
 - Why not?
It's complicated.
Just wait here, I'll be back in a minute.
Ethan?
Lily, I need to talk to you.
I need your help.
 My back is against the wall.
Oh, my God.
Are you serious?
You're a grown man, Ethan.
I can't continually bail you out.
I wouldn't be here if I wasn't serious.
I need a small loan.
- That's all.
 - That's all?
I'm playing bridge.
2,000. It's all I need.
 You guys, your change purse!
What would you do if you didn't have me to turn to?
You'd have to get a job, now wouldn't you?
Oh, that's funny.
 Coming from woman who's never worked a day in her life!
I think we're done here, Ethan.
I will not have my character assassinated
inside my own house.
It's not for me.
 It's for my daughter.
Oh, Ethan.
This is a new low, even for you!
Lying about a child to extort money from your mother?
I'm not lying.
- She's sitting outside right now.
 - Oh, really?
Yeah, really.
Well, don't be rude.
By all means, bring her in.
 I would love to meet my granddaughter.
You can meet her another day.
- Goodbye, Ethan.
 - Okay!
Okay. Fine.
Well, this should be amusing.
Lily, this is Janie.
She's your granddaughter.
Hello, Janie.
Hi.
Ethan, you've got to stop this charade.
 I mean, really.
The two of you ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
- How old are you, young lady?
 - I'm thirteen.
- Thirteen?
 - Yeah.
- And he is your father?
- Yeah.
Ethan, where did you find this child?
 On the street?
It's one thing to waste your own life chasing this music career
But to come in here and demand money from me while you're corrupting this innocent child...
Stop! Stop!
  Okay? Just stop!
Okay? And...
And he's not lying, okay?
He's...
I'm her father.
I'm her father.
- Come on, let's go.
 - Wait.
Please, wait.
 Please, close the door.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have brought you here.
So...
That's your mom?
Yeah.
I thought I had it bad.
Yeah.
I'm sorry, my dear.
I wish I could say that I forgot my medication but there is really no excuse for my behavior.
She has your father's eyes.
So, where are you going?
We gotta get back on the road.
Can't you stay for just a little bit?
No, we really got to get going.
- So where are you headed?
 - Texas.
- Hey, Ethan.
 - Yeah?
- Can I ask you a question?
 - Yeah?
Okay. But you have to promise that you'll tell me the truth.
- Seriously, like really.
 - Okay, yeah.
Was my mom just some groupe that you hooked up with?
No. Not at all.
 I totally dugged your mom.
She was...
She was cool.
- Yeah, okay.
 - She was, I'm serious.
What happened to your father?
You, like, never talk about him.
- If you don't want to talk about it...
 - No, it's cool.
I don't know. I guess I just don't
 really think about him that much.
He was a composer.
He composed modern classical music.
Was a very talented guy.
But he killed himself when I was nine.
He took a bunch of painkillers and a half bottle of whiskey and left me to fend for myself with Lily.
I'm sorry.
 I shouldn't have brought it up.
No, no.
 It's fine.
So how much money did your mom give you, anyway?
A lot.
- Over five grand!
 - Holy shit!
Really?
Who keeps that kind of money just laying around?
The obscenely rich. Criminals.
- [phone ringing]
 - [laughing]
No, no. I checked the cases!
 I checked!
- I swear I checked.
 - You checked the cases?
It wasn't in there!
It wasn't in there!
 I swear!
Hello?
Hey.
No, she's fine.
Oh, he did? That's good.
 We were wondering when we were going to hear from you.
Well, that's good to hear.
I'm glad.
Janie is great.
 We've had a great time together.
We are in Des Moines.
Yeah.
Yeah, I can bring her back to you.
Yeah. Yeah.
Hold on.
It's your mom.
She sounds like she is doing a lot better.
You know, it's not like you could stay out on the road with me forever.
You have to go back to school.
I know.
It's right up here on the right.
Mary Ann and me been clean near a month.
- I'm real proud of her.
 - Thanks, baby.
 I think I owe you an apology.
 I'm going to grab me another beer.
 You want one, buddy?
No, thanks
You don't need to apologize.
If there's anybody who has to apologize here, it's me.
No, no.
 Actually, I do.
Because what I said to you in Little Rock was not cool.
So...
I'm sorry.
Janie is an incredible young woman.
 She is.
You, you are.
She's talented, she's smart.
I don't know what I would have done without her over the last few days.
So, I guess what I'm trying to say is, thank you.
Thank you for bringing her into my life.
You're welcome.
Well, you have a really long drive ahead of you.
I guess I better get going.
You can stay for a just little longer.
 If you wanted to stay a little longer.
I think I have to push off.
But, thank you.
 It was really nice to see you.
- Take care.
 - Bye.

What are you doing here?
I was thinking...
- I think you should come with me.
- Seriously?
Yeah, seriously.
I don't think you should stay here.
