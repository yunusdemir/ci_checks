- Did she find the dog?
- Yeah, I saw her find the dog.
She must have
freaked out, right.
- She started running
around screaming and yelling,
freaking out.
And laid down and started
giving the dog mouth to mouth.
- Disgusting.
Who would do such
a thing like that?
You must have
really hated that dog.
- No, the dog was great.
I loved that dog.
- You loved the dog?
- Then why did you poison it?
- Cruelty to animals is one of
the lowest things you can do.
You're a scumbag.
You asked me for the story,
I'm telling you the story.
- Well I'm sorry I asked.
I hope someone poisons you, Ted.
I really do.
I think about the human race.
I think about the
end of the world.
I wonder about it.
Are we worth saving?
What kind of person poisons
his ex-girlfriend's dog
to get revenge?
How can you forgive someone
for something like that?
Can you forgive them?
I don't know.
It's hard to have faith
in the human race
when there are people
like Ted walking the earth.
You're listening to
Stevie bricks show
and this is Stevie bricks
and I thank you if you're
tuning in tonight.
It's tell-all Tuesday
and I want to know the worst
thing you've ever done.
Maybe you're a
high school teacher
and you've had sex
with a student.
Maybe you're an ex-Nazi
and you worked in a
concentration camp.
Or maybe you worked at
the world bank or tmz.
Whatever it is, this is a chance
for you to tell your story.
Ron from New York,
you're on the air.
What's the worst thing
you've ever done?
- I can't believe I'm
talking to Stevie bricks.
- Man, I love your show.
- Thanks.
- I listen to you
all the time, man.
- All the time.
- Ron, you flatter me.
- What's the worst thing
you've ever done?
- Well, I've never
told anyone this story.
- Okay, well let's hear it.
- It was a long time ago.
It was in college, actually.
- Mm-hmm.
What happened?
Did you take advantage
of someone?
- No, like a girl?
I would never do
anything like that.
- Well, what did you do, Ron?
Hmm?
- I'm sorry, man.
I'm just nervous.
I've been carrying this story
with me for a long time.
Tonight's the night i
finally share it with the world.
Here it goes,
the worst thing I've ever done.
- I cut off a man's--
- Ron, we got to go.
We're late.
- Who are you talking to?
- It doesn't matter.
- Honey, we got to go.
We're already late.
- It's okay.
- Ron, you there?
- Yeah, we are just
dealing with something.
I'm dealing with my wife
actually, so it's fine.
- Who is it?
Who are you talking to?
- It doesn't matter.
- I just don't want
to lose the table
because we all have to
sit at the same time.
- Okay, it looks like Ron is
in the middle of some sort of
domestic dispute.
- We can't sit down
until all of us are there.
- Ron, this is live radio.
I don't have a second.
- No, no it's fine.
It's all taken care of,
because I'm going to tell
you the story right now.
- I'll give you 30 seconds.
- Uh-huh.
Some other time, Ron.
- Hello?
- 29, 28
- hello?
- 27, 26...
- He hung up.
- Who were you talking to?
- Stevie bricks.
- Stevie bricks, the radio guy?
- Ron, he's totally obnoxious.
Come on, let's go.
- How are you
already ready to go?
You take forever to get ready.
- Are you really
wearing that shirt?
- What's wrong with this shirt?
- You look like a
Mexican Ken doll.
- I'm not a 12-year-old, okay.
I can listen to whatever I want.
Besides, I don't give you a
hard time about watching that
prison show you love so much.
- Yeah,
but why would you call in?
- Can you slow down
a little bit?
- Ron, no.
We're running late.
- You're power walking
it feels like
- and my feet are hurting.
- I'm not power walking.
- Seriously,
just slow down a little bit.
- You know what,
you really need to get in shape.
A lot of fat around
the mid-section
is a sign of heart disease.
- I'm fine, okay.
- You know what my mom wants
to get you for Christmas?
- What?
- A defibrillator.
- Get Pesto,
you can get anything you want.
- We can share something.
- Okay, all right.
Isn't my wife the most beautiful
thing you've ever seen?
- She really is.
- Really.
- You like to make me blush.
- Gorgeous.
- Nicki, you look
beautiful as well.
- Oh, thank you.
- Ron, doesn't Nicki
look beautiful tonight?
I don't need confirmation
that she's looks beautiful.
I know she's beautiful.
You look beautiful too.
Everybody here
looks really great.
Now can you guys just stop
doing what you're doing
because I don't even want
to eat dinner because...
- Ron's not one to
give complements much.
Actually he doesn't
really say I love you.
- Well, sometimes.
- What's the matter with you?
- I just don't feel like you
have to say it all the time.
You know, before you go to bed,
before you go to work,
before you go to the bathroom.
There's something about it
that reeks of desperation.
Constantly, "i love you,
i love you,
- I'm not questioning
your love for each other.
- I love you.
- I'm just saying there's
something about it
that's slightly
pathetically sad.
And desperate.
- You should try it.
You should try it, Ron.
- It feels good.
- Yeah, it just feels good.
I don't have to tell her
she's beautiful
to confirm that I love her.
- It's just a reminder that you
can give love and receive love
and it just feels so good
inside when you say it.
- We give and receive love
once a month, at least.
- It's nice to hear sometimes.
I'm just letting you know that.
I'm fine,
it's nice to hear sometimes.
- Listen to your woman.
- How are we doing
over here, guys?
- Good, good.
- Great!
- Are you ready to order?
- Yeah!
- You got any questions
about the menu?
- Um.
- Um.
- I know what I want,
spaghetti and meatballs.
- I think it was based
on her biography.
- Yeah, she went to prison
for like a year and a half
for embezzlement or something.
- I wonder if she regrets it.
- I can't imagine she would.
She got a biography
and a hit TV show out of it.
It's the best thing
that ever happened to her.
- I don't know if I'd trade
18 months of my life
for a career in
film and television.
- Well, she probably saw
it as an opportunity
to capitalize off of a
unique life experience.
- I can't believe we're
sitting around talking about
a television show
about women in prison.
We're all adults, we should
be talking about something
sophisticated, like literature,
or books or something like that.
- This is a worthy conversation.
It's culture.
- Yeah.
- But I'm just sick of hearing
that we're in the golden
age of television, okay.
It's still just a
big distraction.
It doesn't compare to reading.
- This coming from the
man who listens to
the Stevie bricks show.
- Who listens to Stevie bricks?
- What?
- This fucking guy does.
- No.
- He's the worst.
- You listen to Stevie bricks?
- Hey, look at it this way.
If it wasn't for sexist people,
feminism wouldn't have a cause.
- Actually, tonight he was
calling into the show.
That's why we were late.
- It's the first time
i called in.
- You're as low-brow
as they get.
- Stevie bricks
is not low-brow, okay.
He's an anthropologist.
- He has people call in
to break wind on air.
Did you call in to do that?
- I would never air
my air on air.
- Why did you call?
- He doesn't do that
anymore, by the way.
- So, why did you call in?
- Yeah, why did you call in?
- All right, once a week
he has this segment
called tell-all Tuesday,
where callers call in
and they tell a story.
They tell the worst thing
they've ever done.
To talk about the worst
thing I've ever done.
- Yeah, what's the worst
thing you've ever done?
- I don't want to talk about it.
- You were going to
tell all of New York.
- Yeah.
- The moment is gone though.
- No, no, no,
the moment's not gone.
The moment is now.
- Tell us.
Do you know this story?
I mean, he's done some
really shitty things,
so I would love to know
what the worst thing is.
- Tell us.
- I cut a guy's fingers off.
- What?
- Bullshit.
- No, it's true. I did.
- Bullshit.
- I was at a frat party
in college,
partying and drinking.
So, I was waiting in line
to go to the bathroom.
There's a girl standing there,
she's cute
and I start talking to her.
I start flirting.
Because I've had a few drinks
and got a lot of bravado.
I'm very charming, you know,
when I'm drunk.
So we're talking,
having a good time,
we're laughing.
This is all in the span
of a few minutes.
Then, out of the blue, this big
dude comes out of the bathroom
and he sees me
talking to this girl.
Obviously it's his girlfriend.
And he says, "what the fuck are
you doing talking to my girl?"
- It's his girlfriend?
- Apparently,
it's his girlfriend.
- What were you saying to her?
- Nothing, I don't remember.
- People get jealous,
you know...College guys.
- I'm just flirting with her
like people do at parties.
It was a long time ago.
I was drunk and stoned.
I wasn't saying anything
crude or untoward.
He's throttling you
and then what?
- He's smacking you
around like a little bitch.
- No, he's not slapping me
around like a little bitch,
but he's pushing me
up against the wall
and he's screaming at me.
- He's actually assaulting me.
- Right.
- So, I don't take shit
like that from anybody.
I may be a small guy,
but if people fuck with me,
I'll fuck shit up
if I get provoked.
- Okay, just tell us the story.
- Anyway, Rambo.
- So I just react
and I just shove the guy
as hard as I can
I wrestled in high school.
I'm a strong motherfucker.
I can get people
off balance, right.
So the guy's on the floor,
and he's writhing around
and he stands up and
he's really pissed off now,
- because I've humiliated him
in front of all these people.
- Good, good.
- He deserved it, right?
- Yeah, he deserved it.
- I hate punks like that.
- I do too,
- but, at the same time,
he stands up and he's
really pissed off now.
So I'm a little scared,
not because I'm a pussy,
but this is seriously
some fucked up shit.
So, he starts coming after me
and he charges me
with his hands out like this
and my fight or flight
response takes hold.
So I just slam the
bathroom door and I run.
I just run like hell.
But the thing is, this
bathroom door is really heavy.
It's like one of these big
industrial bathroom doors,
so when it slams,
and I slam it shut,
it slams really hard.
It's like "wham!"
You know, really, really hard.
And I start running but then
i hear all this screaming
and yelling, like,
"oh my god!"
It's complete pandemonium.
And I look up and this frat
guy is back on me again
and he's like,
"look what you did to me!
Look what you did to me,
mother fucker!"
- And there's blood everywhere.
- Oh my god.
Again, I'm a little stone
and inebriated.
But I'll never forget this.
There's blood all over
my sweater,
blood all over the walls.
He says,
"look what you did to me!"
And I look up
and two of his fingers
are missing.
They're cut off and there's
blood just gushing everywhere.
Again, this is a frenzy.
It's out of control.
- It's complete bedlam.
- I can't believe you
didn't tell me this.
- The door cut his
fucking fingers off.
- Really?
- Is it a heavy, heavy door?
It could have done that?
- It wasn't like they were
dangling or mangled.
- They were clean cut.
- Off? Off?
- Off.
- And then what happened?
- So everybody's freaking out.
The guy's freaking out.
And I just run, I run like hell.
I run out of the frat house.
I run across campus.
And I pretty much hide in the
dorm room until the next day.
- Did you get into trouble?
- They didn't have
cell phones back then
so no one took a photo.
- No one saw you.
No one fingered you?
- People saw me, but they
didn't know who we were.
We used to go to these frat
parties, my friend and I.
We would bounce
around frat court.
We would go from one
frat party to next frat party,
- drinking their beer,
fucking their women.
- Right, sure.
- That's the way you do,
or the way one does.
- You guys...
- Anyway, that's the
worst thing I ever did.
- Did you ever wonder
whatever happened to that guy?
- I wouldn't know that guy
if I saw him today.
- You don't think that's
hanging over your head.
The guy's somewhere
standing nearby.
- It could be this guy right
here and I wouldn't even know.
You know?
- How are you guys doing?
- Good.
- Good, a little nauseated.
- Anybody want dessert?
- Yes, I'll have the tiramisu.
- No!
- Oh, this is so good.
- Why didn't you guys
just get your own?
- I just wanted a bite.
- We could have gotten extra.
- Take your time,
whenever you guys are ready.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- No, no we got this.
- Yeah.
- This is our turn.
- Are you sure?
- You guys paid last time.
- Did we?
- Yeah.
- Yeah,
it's definitely our turn.
- I mean, this place is more
expensive than the last place,
but that's fine.
- Goodnight, babe.
Oh sweetheart,
I'm really stuffed.
That food was so rich.
- You want to fool
around a little bit?
- I'm really tired, honey.
I had a fucking long day.
- Fine.
- Hey.
- Yeah.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
- Les?
- Huh?
- What's the worst thing
you've ever done?
- I need to tell you something.
- Huh, what?
- I love you.
- Huh?
- I love you.
- Hey look at me for a second.
- What?
- I love you.
- I know.
- No, I mean, I really,
really love you.
You're the most beautiful
women I've ever seen in my life.
If I believed in god,
i would thank him or her,
everyday, that he made you
just stupid enough to marry me.
- Thanks.
- Thank you for
making her so stupid.
I don't know what i
would do without you.
- You're very sweet.
- We should make a baby.
- No.
- What the fuck.
- That's the most disgusting
thing I've ever heard
in my entire life.
- You asked me
and I told you.
Why the fuck did you ask me
if you didn't want to hear it.
- You peed on a puppy?
An innocent puppy?
- It was in fucking high school.
It was ages ago.
You're with your punk ass
high school friends
and you're walking in the woods
and you see a stray puppy,
so you pull out your cocks
and you piss all over it?
- That's what you did?
- I'm not proud of it.
- I'm going to be sick.
- Why are you getting so upset?
You're acting like we
ripped it open and ate it.
- I just wish you never
would have told me.
I can't handle things like this.
You know I obsess over things.
- Fine, can we start over now?
The worst thing I ever did?
I stole a pair of
running shoes, okay.
- What was it doing when you
were pissing all over it?
It would run one way,
i would spray it with pee.
- I'm going to be sick.
I'm going to be so sick.
- You know, when we first met
and we were experimenting,
we use to give each
other golden showers,
remember that?
- That was consensual.
- Okay, the next time
i pee on a puppy,
I'll get his consent,
all right.
- When I was in college,
I used to be an
animal rights activist.
I use to throw buckets of paint
on people who wore fur coats.
- That's a fantastic way
to solve a problem,
just throw a
bucket of paint on it.
Who thought of that?
It's genius.
- Its better than
a bucket of piss.
- Fine, shut the light.
- You need to make amends.
- I'll make a donation
to the humane society.
- That could work.
- Like, five thousand dollars.
- Fine.
- That's five thousand less
than we'll have to spend
on shit we like.
- Like, five hundred dollars.
- Done.
- Shut the light.
What's the worst thing
you've ever done?
Does anybody recognize
what I'm drawing?
- Twin towers?
- Twin towers.
That's exactly right.
And we all know what
happened to the twin towers.
September 11th 2001,
they were reduced to a big
heap of smoldering rubble, okay.
We went to war with Afghanistan
and we went to war with Iraq
and now Iraq is completely
discombobulated and in pieces.
So, what I want to know is,
instead of going to war,
what are some alternatives
to going to war?
What are some things we could
have done besides going to war?
So, Cameron, let's say
that I walk up to you.
You're in the hallway
and I just punch you.
I just punch you.
I punch you in the shoulder.
Okay, what are you going to do?
- I'm probably going
to punch you back!
- Well, yeah.
That's right, you know.
And I would understand that,
and that's exactly the way
we acted after 9/11.
We were all very angry,
we wanted revenge.
We were also very scared,
so we reacted with force, okay.
But there wasn't a
lot of compassion.
There was compassion for
the people we lost on 9/11.
There was compassion
for the families,
but there wasn't so
much compassion
for the people we bombed.
Rain, can you put your
cell phone away, please?
So what are some alternatives?
What are some things
we could do besides
punch back, basically.
- You could talk.
- That's good, Kimberly.
We could talk.
Someone punches you,
you could ask a question,
for example.
Ask me why I punched you,
Cameron.
I just punched you in the face.
Ask me a question.
Rain.
Come on, man.
Put the cell phone away,
seriously.
You're cramping my
whole style here, okay.
Give it to me.
Give it to me.
- Give it to me.
- No.
- What are you doing?
Why are you doing this?
- This is so stupid.
- Why is this stupid?
- Do you realize
what you're saying?
You're saying that the
terrorists were justified
in what they did.
- No, I'm not saying that.
- Yeah, you are.
- I'm trying to get you all
to learn empathy,
which is something
this me generation of me,
- me, me, doesn't have.
- Empathy?
Why should I be
listening to you?
It's adults that start the wars?
- I had to push a lot strings to
get this through the curriculum.
But, I'm glad you guys
are appreciating it.
You guys have a good day,
take care.
Jesus Christ.
Les?
What are you doing, man?
- I should fuck you up
right now.
- Kate told me about your little
finger bang party last year.
I didn't think you
were the kind of guy
to fuck around with
another man's wife.
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah Zane, it's cool.
- Yeah. It's fine.
He's fine, thanks. It's cool.
You can go back
to your friends.
- This is where I work, man.
Don't do this shit, okay.
We were fucking wasted.
It didn't mean anything.
- Oh, is that an excuse?
Does that make it okay?
You were wasted?
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm contemplating
kicking your ass,
but I don't want
to get in trouble.
You hit somebody in the
temple hard enough
you can kill them instantly.
I don't need a manslaughter
conviction.
- Nobody needs a manslaughter
conviction.
- Why did she tell you?
- I have no idea
why she told me.
I would rather I didn't know.
- It was innocent.
You know where I come from
stinky pinky isn't innocent.
It's second base.
- Stinky pinky?
- Did you fuck her?
- No, man.
We made out in a bathroom.
It was like two years ago.
I barely remember it, man.
I was plastered.
You're not going to
tell Nicki, are you?
- No, but you should.
- I'm not going to.
- Yeah, I'm not surprised.
You always seemed
like a coward to me.
- I'm not a coward, man.
I use to live in bedstuy.
- You don't see Kate anymore,
you understand.
You don't talk to her,
you don't even dream about her.
- I can't control
what I dream about.
I had a dream last night i
was 69-ing Donald rumsfeld.
- Listen to me.
I know gangsters, right.
Real ones.
Sicilians and shit.
You may have cut a guy's
fingers off by accident
but I know people who do that
for a living, okay?
You just watch your back,
motherfucker.
- I wash my back every night.
- Watch!
Watch, motherfucker!
- Fuck.
- Now, my first marriage
was a disaster.
My second marriage
was not much better.
My third was okay...
...but far from perfect.
I'm not a Saint, I'll admit it,
but we all have needs.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- ...food and shelter...
- You're listening
to Stevie bricks.
- Yeah.
- I'm just trying to figure out
what you see in this guy.
- What are they talking about?
- Adultery.
- Did you talk to les?
- Huh? No.
- Turn this off.
This guy's an idiot.
- Oh, now he's an idiot?
I thought you
worshipped the guy.
- You hungry?
- I guess.
- Let's get some Chinese food.
- Okay.
- Les.
- Yes.
- Are you going to talk to me?
- I'm eating.
- So?
- I don't like talking
with my mouth full.
- Well, talk to me when
your mouth is empty.
- I don't feel like
talking tonight.
- Les, I'm sorry.
- What are you sorry about?
It was just a finger, right?
Just one finger.
What's the big deal?
- Felix, how are you?
- Hey, hood to see you.
- Good to see you too.
How are things?
- Good, everything's fine.
- How's your family?
- Family's good, too.
- Good?
- There you go, keep the change.
- Thank you.
- Keep the change.
- Oh, thank you.
- Business is better than ever.
- Better than ever?
- In this economy,
the way this economy is,
- nothing's...
You know, that's great.
- Yeah, nothing is affecting us.
- That's what happens when
you sell a good product
- at a good price.
- Oh, thank you.
- That's probably the reason why
- no one goes to
the movies anymore.
- Right, right!
- Well, thanks very much.
- Thank you so much.
- You're a good customer.
- Thanks very much.
- Take care.
- You really want to
watch "life in orange?"
- Yeah, I want to find out
what the masses are watching.
- Wow, join the herd.
You make it sound so dumb.
- Well, this is the
new normalcy...
The new normality I should say.
Each episode is tuning us out
just a little bit more.
It's what aldous huxley
talked about in brave new world.
- It's also what
Neil postman wrote about.
- I don't know who that is.
- It doesn't matter if
we're getting dumber,
because the singularity
will fix everything.
- Ron, I don't care.
I just want to watch the show.
- Okay.
Is there full frontal in this?
- Les, you're going to be late.
Can I make you breakfast?
- Okay, so operation ajax!
- Isn't that a soap?
- Yeah well, it is a soap, yes.
But in terms of
what happened here,
I wouldn't say there
was anything clean
about what America did, okay.
But if you consider
what we did,
which was pretty lousy,
let's imagine a hypothetical
where it didn't happen.
And we didn't go in and get rid
of the prime minister of Iran
in the 1950s.
How might that have
that affected
middle eastern relations today?
How might the middle east
view us today,
- well, it was in our best
interest to do it though,
wasn't it?
Economically, it was in our
best interest to take their oil.
All Iran wanted to do
was nationalize their oil,
so what was in
their best interest?
That's what people
don't talk about.
Let's say you got a million
dollars under your bed, okay.
It's in my best interest
to take that million dollars
if I want it,
because I can do a
lot with that money.
But it's not in
your best interest.
Rain, come on, man.
Put the cell phone away.
I'm tired of dealing with this,
every time we're talking.
- Yo, this shit doesn't matter.
All of this matters.
Empathy matters, okay.
- Give me the cell phone!
- Yo, fuck you, Mr. Wells.
- Ooh.
- Nicki.
That's nice.
♪
- Chastity stock is up
4 dollars.
- I told you, right?
I haven't steered you wrong yet.
- I wonder how high
it's going to go
when that first consumer
rocket goes into orbit.
- It's going to go right up

- Let's hope so!
- Sorry, Barry.
Let me take this call.
This guy's not going to
leave me alone otherwise.
Fuck face, I told
you not to contact me.
- You're a sick
son-of-a-bitch, les.
- Oh, I'm a sick son-of-a-bitch?
How so?
- Don't play dumb.
You know what I'm talking about.
- I'm with a client, Ron.
- I thought it was fake at
first, but it's fucking real.
- What's real?
What are you talking about?
- The finger, les.
Give me a break.
The finger, man!
- The finger?
Which one?
- Where did you get it?
One of your mafia connections?
- You told me you had ties
to the sicilian mafia family.
- What?
You think because I'm Italian
that I'm connected to the mob?
What the fuck is that?
- You said so yourself.
- I was just trying to
scare you, you imbecile.
- Well, I don't scare
so easily, les.
I once watched "the exorcist,"
by myself,
in the dark,
all the way through.
I have no idea what
you're talking about so,
- you're lucky i
don't go to the police.
- Go to the police, Ron.
Whatever it is
you're talking about...
- I don't need the police, okay?
Let me tell you something,
you might be Italian,
but I'm turkish and turkish
people are fucking crazy.
So watch your fucking back.
- Fuck you.

Hello?
Who is that?
- Honey?
- Ron?
- Hey. You home?
- Oh, my god.
What are you doing?
- Hey babe.
- What is going on in here?
- I thought there was a robber.
- I've got this little
thyroid thing in my thigh.
I was trying to get it out.
My leg was clotting
or something.
- Ron, you need to get
this under control.
You need to see the
trainer I'm working with.
He said he's going to
give you two free sessions.

married me for my...
- No, I married you because
you were a hot wrestler.
- I can still do it, you know.
Come on.
Can you go like that?
I'll fucking barnyard

Barnyard you.
Do you want me to?
- What?
I was out with a client.
- You're avoiding me, les.
- What do you want me to say?
- Just talk to me.
It's like we're strangers
all of the sudden.
- All I want to say
are hurtful things, Kate.
I just keep seeing your
hands on his cock
and his fingers inside of you.
- My hand was never
on his cock.
- Yeah, well that's
what I keep seeing.
I keep seeing his tongue
in your mouth
and his hands all over you.
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, you keep saying that.

Come on.
Gioia, come on!
We need to go!

something to provoke her.
You know she can
be very sensitive.

Rain's behavior is
becoming more anti-social.
It's interfering with class.
- Mrs. Bennet, is anything
happening at home
that might be
causing rain distress?
- Well, her grandfather
is very sick
- oh, that's sad to hear.
- Diabetes is a serious illness.
They had to amputate one
of his legs below the knee.
They may have to
amputate the other leg soon.
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Yeah, that's awful.
- But this doesn't give
cause for her to act out
the way you say
that she is.
Normally, she's very
respectful towards authority.
- Yeah, but she's
extremely hostile to me.
- Maybe she's defending herself.
- No.
She's antagonistic.
She's aggressive.
It's completely unprovoked.
- Well, her father was
from the middle east
and her father was
very emotionally abusive.
- So, he's no longer
in the picture?
- No. He sells shish kabobs
in sabzevar.
- Just because he was
emotionally abusive,
doesn't mean that all
middle eastern men
- just because all middle
eastern men aren't abusive
doesn't mean that you're not.
- You can't blame everything
on the middle east.
- I agree with Ron.
And besides, Ron's American.
- Yeah, but my family
is from Turkey.
- And they have very
backwards policies
towards their women there.
Turkey has a very western
attitude towards women.
They expect for their
women to be obsequious there.
- Turkish women, obsequious?
- Yeah.
- No. If anything turkish
women are bossy and bitchy.
- Bossy and bitchy?
- I don't mean it like that.
- Do you see what I mean?
- Strong.
Turkish women are very strong.
- No, you're trying
to cover it up.
- I'm mainly referring
to my mother.
My mother was bossy
and bitchy.
- She still is.
- Ron, Ron, Ron, chill.
- I can't be in the room
with this man.
- Mrs. Bennet,
Mrs. Bennet, listen.
We care greatly
about rain's education.
We feel she's a
very bright girl.
- She's absolutely
a bright girl.
I don't like him.
I don't like him either,
but that's another story.
So how long has rain's
father been out of the picture?
- I became a teacher so
i could make a difference,
to feel good about my life.
But I just feel like I'm
not reaching these kids.
I think it's the parents
to blame to be honest.
I mean, I really just think
that my students hate me.
- I hated all my teachers
in high school.
- You did?
- Yeah.
- Even the ones you fucked?
- Especially the ones I fucked.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Did you fuck a lot of them?
- Oh yeah, actually, this shirt.
But can you wash it on cold?
Just wash all of it on cold.
- Wash it on hot.
Got it. I got it.
You need anything else?
- Um... I don't think so.
- Anything dirty?
Your panties?
Are they a little crusty?
Are they a little dirty?
Can I take your panties and
give those a nice washing?
- You want my dirty panties?
- I like your dirty panties.
I like your nice,
crusty panties.
That's the best
thing in the world.
There's nothing like

You didn't always

I'm just agitated.
I don't like it when people
ask me why I'm agitated...
I don't know.
- Miss, are you okay?
- It's Mrs. and she's fine.
- I got it.
- God damn, fucking cock!!
- Let's see if we can
match the severed member
to the severed foot.
It might be from the same body.
- Judging from the foot size,
I'd say it is.
- Ma'am, if you have
any trouble at all,
don't hesitate to call me.
- Wait a second, why are you
giving her special treatment?
I'm the one who
got violated, man.
- Calm down, buddy.
- Don't tell me to calm down.
There was a severed dick
in my mouth.
I've sucked a dick before,
in college,
but it was attached
to a body, okay.
And my wife is running around
acting like a fucking
sword swallower
from the barnum
and Bailey circus.
And out of all the cops in
Brooklyn they can send me,
they send me andré the giant
and Betty boop.
Okay, I want some
fucking answers!
- No, I'll tell you this,
if I found a penis
in my Chinese food,
I'd probably throw a rock
through the window.
What's the name of the place?
What is it?
Hong Kong castle?
They should change it
to long dong castle.
Be careful ordering noodles
from that place, people.
You might get
something a little extra.
Anyway, by now most
of you have heard,
the chastity fielding 27,
crashed after take-off
on Tuesday.
This was supposed to be the
first commercial airplane
to orbit the earth.
- This place is great.
I had dinner here
a few weeks ago.
Yeah, well,
i hope you're paying.
Chastity stock is
down 50 percent.
- It's all right, Barry.
Don't worry.
I got this.
- "Consumer space travel,
that's the way of the future."
- That's what you said, dude.
- It is. It is.
- Well, if that first test
flight is any indication,
the future looks pretty bleak.
- Come on, Barry.
Listen.
It's a test,
the rocket exploded in a test.
That's what a test is for.
- You guys ready to order?
- Yeah, I think so.
- I was over hearing
your conversation
about the chastity thing.
Man, that was a tragedy, huh.
They'll get a consumer flight
into space before you know it
and that stock's going to
take off like a rocket.
- Hopefully, it doesn't take
off like the last one did.
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure
they're going to get it up.
There's no doubt about that.
It's only a matter of time.
Can you imagine
being that pilot?
Having trained his whole life
for that one moment.
And then you're finally up
soaring toward the sky and
everything you studied for,
hoped for, dreamed for....
Gone.
- Honey,
nobody is following you.
Really,
with the spitting, still?
So, they're not actually
firing you, right?
- No, it's a leave of absence.
- Okay, so great.
How long?
- Like, a month.
- And they're paying you?
- Yeah.
- Okay, so what's the big deal?
- I don't get why companies act
like a leave of absence with pay
is punishment.
It's a gift.
- That's a good way
of looking at it.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I'm not really hungry.
You got any wine or any liquor?
- I know who's sending
you body parts.
Fuck it, let's have a drink.
- It's just too simple, man.
It's not that simple.
- Why?
- Because there are too many...
- Too many what?
- Too many suspects.
- Who?
- You.
- I'm not sending you
body parts, okay.
- My students, for one.
- Who?
- Rain, the one who hates me.
- Why would she send you
body parts?
- Because she hates me.
- Where would she
get the body parts?
- Her grandfather has diabetes;
They amputated his foot.
- That's fucking ridiculous.
- You thought she took her
grandfather's amputated foot
and put it in the dryer?
- It's not funny.
- Yes, it is.
- Actually it isn't.
My uncle has diabetes.
- Tom Hanks has diabetes.
- What?
- Okay and then I thought
maybe it was rain's mom.
- Why would she
send you body parts?
- She hates arabs, okay
and that's the new trend
in the world,
is to blame the muslims.
- You're not Muslim.
- She doesn't know that.
- It's this guy, the waiter.
He overheard us
talking that night.
- Where did he get my name?
Where did he get our address?
- You paid for dinner.
- Yeah, I remember, because
you never pay for dinner.
But you did that night.
So he has your name and he
has your credit card number.
Finding out your address
with that information
isn't that difficult.
- Okay, possibly.
But the chances that it's the
same guy from college,
- that was 20 years ago,
there's no fucking way.
- So what?
- It's too coincidental.
- This shit happens
all the time.
- He's right, he's right.
My aunt turned 50,
she went to Tibet
on a mountain
climbing expedition.
She gets to the top
of this mountain,
there's a man sitting on a rock,
next to a camp fire.
It's her high school
sweetheart,
who she has not seen
in 30 years.
- Bullshit.
- I swear to god it's true.
It's like the guy who
accidentally fucked his sister
at a frat party.
- It's a little more
romantic than that.
- I hired a private investigator
to do a background
check on this guy
and find out who he is.
- No, you didn't.
- Yeah, I did.
- We can't afford a
private investigator.
- You don't have to worry about
it, I'm taking care of it.
- Well, that's pretty
big of you.
- Well, I'm a big man, Ron.
- Yeah, you are, very big.
- Well, you would know, Nicki.
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, he didn't tell you?
- Tell me what?
- You fucked around with him,
and that's what happens.
- I didn't fuck around with him.
- This is how I felt
for the last two weeks!
- She sucked your dick?
- I can't even believe you!
- His name is Wally Moore,
age 42,
lives in sunset park,
born and raised in
Minneapolis, Minnesota.
He waits tables at the raven.
- Where did this guy
go to college?
- Boston college,
that's where I went to school,
- it's got to be the same guy.
- Holy shit.
- What year did he graduate?
- He didn't.
- Why?
- It says he dropped out
his sophomore year.
- I don't know. It's strange
too, he had a scholarship.
- What kind of scholarship?
- Music.
Turns out, he had been
a noted saxophonist
from the time he was a child.
He was considered
something of a prodigy.
- A prodigy, really?
- Yeah, he must have
been very good
because he's missing two
fingers on his hand.
- Fuck.
- I ruined the guy's life.
- Come on, don't say that.
- What's he talking about?
- He cut the guys fingers off.
- Why did you do that?
- It was an accident.
- Oh, well,
that would account for
why he dropped out
of college.
- I fucked his whole life up.
He had dreams of being
the next Charlie Parker.
I severed his dreams,
literally, severed his dreams.
You can't be a saxophone player
with fucking three fingers.
- Hey, look, remember
that one-armed drummer
from that rock band
back in the 80's?
- Remember that guy?
- Uh-huh.
- What's your point?
- I don't really have one.
How'd you find out all
this information so quickly?
- Are you kidding?
I got half this shit
off his Facebook page.
- Oh, he looks happy.
- He does, doesn't he?
- He doesn't look sad at all.
- Maybe I didn't ruin his life.
- No, I think you
probably ruined his life.
- Why do you say that?
- He likes to go to a
jazz club called dino's.
- You know the place?
- No.
- Yeah, I know the place.
- Yeah, okay.
Well, go there sometime.
You'll see what
I'm talking about.
He's there almost every night.
♪
- What do we do, guys?
- We should follow him.
- What?
- You want to follow him?
- I don't know, it's just the
first thing I thought of.
- That's a dumb idea.
Think things through for once.
- I'm not good at thinking,
okay.
The first time I saw that
famous statue by rodin,
I didn't even
recognize what he was doing.

he looked?
That guys looked
really depressed,

call it the blues.

an amazing career.
He could have been

been the next Kenny g.
Maybe you did the world a favor.
- I should go talk to him,
maybe.
I should maybe talk to him
and try to make amends,
or something.
- Ron, you should
go to the police.
He's clearly the guy who's been
sending you those body parts
and he's dangerous.
- She's right, Ron.
- Right?
What?
What's wrong?
Why are you looking at me
like that?
- I'm just looking at you.
You're so beautiful.
I can see why les wanted to
put his dick in your mouth.
- I've gotten my fair share of
hate mail all over the years,
telling me I'm a scumbag,
the scourge of the earth,
the cancer of the airwaves.
But no one's ever sent
me a severed animal head,
until today.
I think it was a cat,
I didn't keep it long enough
to find out.
It was terrifying
in a lot of ways,
knowing that someone went
through the trouble
to send me such a thing.
I'm a little rattled,
i will admit.
But I'm not deterred.
The words I say,
the opinions I take,
the thoughts in my head,
they will not cease.
They will flow from my mouth
like a furious river.
Decapitate all the cats in
Brooklyn if you have to.
Call in Isis!
I will not be intimidated!
You do not scare me!
- We're looking for
a Mr. Wally Moore.
- That's me.
We would like to just ask
you a couple questions.

What's up?
- Do you have a place,
we can speak privately?
- Yeah, come on in back.
- Thank you, sir.
- So I got something here
for you,
one of my favorite things.
This place has the best
cupcakes in Brooklyn.
So these are red velvet,
- and they are to die for.
- Dig in, buddy.
- They are so good.
- Come on, have one, wycoff.
- You don't eat sugar?
You don't eat sweets?
- Its good, right.
It's delicious, it's amazing.
- Awesome.
- So what's the status?
- We got the DNA samples
back from the body parts.
- Well, that's great.
Who's the victim?
- No idea.
We couldn't track the person.
It's a male, white guy,
that's all we know.
- That could be anybody.
- That's correct, there are a
lot of white people in New York.
- Okay, so now what?
What happens now?
- So, we don't know who it is.
But this is where it gets
especially strange.
- Okay.
- The blood on the foot,
it wasn't real.
- That doesn't make
any sense at all.
- That doesn't make any sense.
- You're saying it's fake blood?
Like fake blood from
like, the fake blood store?
- Tomato sauce.
- Tomato...Tomato sauce?
- Marinara.
- Marinara?
Marinara?
Marinara, marinara,
like, the marinara sauce,
- yeah, marinara, marinara.
Yeah.
- Why would the guy put
marinara sauce on a real foot?
- Why would he do that?
- That, my friend,
is a good question.
- Yeah, and what's the answer?
- I don't have the answer.
The guy's probably nuts.
- Yeah, the guys' probably nuts.
You talked to the guy?
- Which one?
- Wally, the waiter,
the guy I went to college with.
- Yeah, yeah, that guy.
Yeah, we talked to him.
- And?
- He didn't do it.
- You didn't arrest the guy?
- No.
- Why didn't you arrest the guy?
- I just told you,
he didn't do it.
- Of course he did it.
This is the guy,
I'm telling you...
- Look, we interviewed the guy
and he was a really nice guy.
- He's a very nice guy.
- He is, yeah.
- Ted Bundy was a nice guy,
okay.
Just because your nice doesn't
mean you're not capable of
doing really fucked up
crazy morbid up shit.

the Roman empire,
the ottoman empire,

going to fall too.
One day,
it's going to collapse, boom,
