- Good day.
- Hello.
Where have you worked before?
In a cafe, in the town.
- Why did you quit?
- The money was not enough.
I have studied here for 3 years
so I came back.
- This is my profession.
- Right. Fill up this question form.
Take the sheets with you
and...
starring
Maria! There is a telegramme
for you.
I'd like to ask you to allow me
to go back to my former room.
- My friend also lives there.
- But it's taken... we will see.
Mrs. Berek!
- I have to leave now.
- Is there a problem?
I do not know, but I will
be here tomorrow morning.

I've received the telegramme.
Hi. What happened?
Your mother...
is dead.
I woke up early in the morning,
she was already got up.
I went to have the breakfast.
I saw that she had not started
to make her tea,
but I did not think
anything wrong.
Then Kati wanted to talk to her
about shopping.
But there she was lying
on the floor.
Kati immediately told me,
and I called the ambulance.
But we did not think that
there is so big problem.
The doctor came and said...
her heart.
Then we immediately sent you
the telegramme.
But she died soon.
We did all the paperworks.
You do not have to do anything...
That's life.
- Good day.
- Welcome.
My mum died unexpectedly.
- Poor woman. Was she ill?
- No.
- Is everything all right?
- Well...
Well, Mrs Bodnar...
you know Julika.
Her husband was here
with their child.
There was such a big scandal...
Mrs Berek is just waiting you.
- The child stayed here.
- Right.
- Good bye...
- Good bye...
Read these.
I want to talk with you
about Mrs. Bodnar and the stealing.
You know the one whose husband
stayed here for the night.
Yeah, I know her.
And now her husband came again,
they fought and he left.
He's left the little girl.
- But this is forbiddeen.
- Ok, I also know the rules.
I will do something.
- I will talk with her.
- She is too wild.
Two pulovers and a trousers
dissappeared again.
And I know who stole them.
Do you know?
You are an excellent investigator...
Well, you should stop
the stealings.
I agree.
.. and.. are you mourning someone?
My mother just died.
- My deepest condolences.
- Thank you.
Good day.
Please come to my office,
when you have time.
- Do you want to fire me?
- I'd like to have a word with you.
Then tell me now
what you want, right?
I want to talk with you in private.
You did not observe the rules
second time.
Once your husband stayed for the night.
And now this scandal.
I know you can fire me
by the rules.
I do not want to kick you out.
But you should take the child
somewhere else.
But where? Can't you imagine
there is no place to take her?
I know...
But the rules are rules.
- She can not stay here.
- Well, my daughter will stay.
She will be here tomorrow
and after tomorrow.
I hope you won't call the police
But as I know you...
one of you is reporting
the other is calling the police...
And you're starting to insult me.
That's the way you are.
But I'm not surprised.
What's that? Are you miffed?
Go away!
Go away!
- Can you hear?
- Get out off here!
Collect the things of the child,
and move here both of you.
Anyway I've got two rooms.
- Is it ok?
- Yeah it's ok.
Go there! You also!
Girls! Come here!
Everybody!
You two, come here!
I can not talk to you normally.
I closed the doors.
You won't leave till you do not give
back the stolen pulover.
Understand?
My office is open
so put it on my desk.
I'm waiting.
Come on!
I'm curious about who will
put the pulover on your desk.
It's not you business, ok?
I know what Mrs Berek wants.
Searching, like the police.
Am I right?
Here is the pulover. It was unnecessary
to rummage among the things of the girls.
You are not right.
We have to teach them the rules!
Who the hell are you?
Where do you come from?
You are one among them,
like me.
Pulover is here, do not
deal with other things!
Neither the girls!
- But I want to make
the rules observe! - Me also!
But not the way you want.
This thing is finished!
I'm the director, understand?
- Bye.
- Bye.
He beacame so nervous that...
he had a book in his hands...
and he thrown it in my direction.
Then I jumped and
wanted to kill him.
We started to fight.
He took me to the ground,
it's so typical.
It happened many times.
But I can not get rid of this things.
We did these things in front of
our daughter.
How old was she?
She started walking,
around 1,5 years old.
And she saw it.
He pushed me to the wall,
and suddenly he started to kiss me...
Anyway... I love him so much
I love them so much:
my husband and my daughter.
I can no do anything.
I love them so much.
Once I breastfeed.
And I put my daughter to the ground.
And I breastfeed her this way
Do you understand me?
Have you ever feel that you love someone
so much that you're afraid of your love?
Afraid?
Yeah, afraid of doing something wrong,
because of my love.
Oh, I do not know.
I understand that he's an alcoholic.
Because for example if there is
an application in the factory
and his application is the best,
as people often says that,
but it is not accepted, because
he do not have a degree.
He did a course but he do not
have a degree.
So his application was refused.
Then I told him to go to college,
but he did not want to.
That time I left him, but I went
back to him... I missed him.
I want to pay!
Can I...?
Why do not you sleep?
I waited for you.
Ok, now get asleep.
- Do you love your daughter?
- I love her so much, and you?
Me too.
You love everbody.
What about you?
I do not love everybody.
Not.
You are crazy.
What do you have in mind?
The secretary of the party kissed her.
After the third time he said,
'I start to feel it.'
I thought you came home permanently
this week.
- We have to paint your room.
- I would like it white.
It will be white if you want,
it will be your room.
Till you'll get married.
When will you go to the HR department?
You are only interested in
keeping me home.
But I can not leave 200 people there.
We are starting to reach
the first succes.
I can not leave them now.
It's ok. But now everything
will change.
If I go to Mongolia you will have to
be here.
I know. But please understand me.
It happens so fast.
Perhaps they won't allow me to quit.
- I know everybody's replaceable, but..
- What are you saying?
I do not want to
leave them right now.
But we need you here.
What is the problem?
I've got old.
Kati is 20 now. You will
be a grandmother soon.
What is the problem?
Tell me, Juli.
I can not bear him.
He has not drunk for a while,
but now...
he got drunk again.
We were together all day.
Talked a lot,
everything was fine.
- Keep calm.
- I left home after lunch...
And?
When I got back,
Janos was totally drunk.
And the child was there with his
drunken father.
You shouldn't have left the child.
I had enough of this!
- I can not go back there.
- But you have to.
- I will go with you.
- No I won't!
- You have to!
- I'll stay here.
Think about Zsuzsi.
- No!
- But you have to!
- Do not cry!
- We go and bring Zsuzsi here.
Hello. Where is you father?
I'm here to take you to
your mother.
- Your mother is waiting for you.
- I'll wait till my father come back.
You should not.
Just come with me.
I like to be alone, very much.
But your mother is waiting for you.
So we should go.
Zsuzsi what are you doing?
- Nothing.
- Come here and sit down.
We met your husband in the street.
- And? Anything happened?
- No, he was very sympathic.
I said Juli is here,
but he did not come.
Your husband thinks Janos
is a sympathic person.
I do not know Janos yet.
Can I ask something?
Why do you not go home?
Is it good for you?
It's my business, I think.
Do you want more?
- Yes, that's your life.
- No problem.
Now we go to sleep.
Let's brush your teeth.
Juli is working at the factory.
I love her so much.
- And the child?
- Her child is with her.
She left her husband and the flat.
But I think...
she will go back to her husband.
Her husband seems to be a normal guy.
He smiles kindly.
Wait, I'll open.
I'm leaving now.
- Could you bring me the key?
- Yeah, but won't Zsuzsi miss you?
No, because she is sleeping.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Ok, bye.
- Bye.
Your girlfriend is strange.
She is uneasy since
she left her husband.
It's a hard situation. They can not live
neither together, nor without the other.
Did something happen?
You look nervous.
I'm just thinking about Juli.
What do they want?
Don't you think it's unusual?
Do you think they are strange?
Once I think they are fool
other times I'm envy of them.
I think they are just fools.
You shouldn't say this.
Their life is complicated.
It is why I'm happy to go back.
Are you angry?
Yes. And I would like to know
what will happen with us.
Belive in me.
Good night.
Where are you going?
Don't hurry!
Wait!
It's so late!
Don't be foolish!
Whose clock is it?
I paid three beers for it.
Congratulation.
Now I'm leaving. Ok?
- No! Stay, darling!
- But I have to go.
Then bye. Give me a kiss!
You do not want to kiss me?
- Bye.
- Bye.
Mari, a supervision is going on.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Good morning.
We found everything in order.
I'm happy. Why do supervise us?
You know, just the usual
annual supervision.
I see. For a second, please.
There is something
we should talk about.
This way, to my room.
I would like to ask
whether you live here alone.
Why do you ask it?
I've heard gossips that
I'd like to discuss.
So somebody informs you on me.
Take a sit.
Oh, what made you think that?
I do not think, I know.
Ok. So a woman and her daughter
live with me.
- She is my friend.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Yeah, Bodnárné is your friend.
That is fine. But a child.
You know that a child
must not live here.
I know. I face the consequences.
But you should not do that.
You should rather observe the rules.
And.. there is a lot of stealing.
You are not severe enough.
It's a new dormitory for workers.
Everybody is new here.
Even you just came from a village.
Don't forget that.
The discipline they need in
the factory is new for them.
Be more patient. You should
learn more patience, Magda.
There is no problem with purity, however
we need a bigger cultural life.
I will talk with the girls today and...
the only thing which is important
that they feel well here.
I want bigger discipline here.
We were satisfied with you as a
leader of the working group.
But here everything is else.
It is not a working place for them.
This is their home.
Right, but I say...
you should be severe right now
during the first year.
There is a lot of free
room in this dormitory.
Less than 80% is occupied.
If we would give rooms to
divorced women with childs,
there would be eoungh workers.
Well, you should not make new rules.
Just do your job.
We have to go.
Good bye.
Good bye.
Come to my office.
Why are you staring at me,
you little whore?
Lick my ass!
Don't you hear me?
Lick my ass!
So, what do you think?
- I'll inform on you.
- Oh, I thought.
- What is wrong?
- I can not sleep, headache.
I'm going to the reception
for sleeping pills.
No, I don't need them.
- Stay here.
- Then some 'Anti-Neuralgika'.
I'm thinking on my husband.
He was not happy
when I came back.
As I would be a criminal.
Then the pills will help.
Sorry Marika, somebody
is waiting for Juli.
- Who?
- Your husband.
- Is he drunken?
- I don't know. He is quiet and polite.
He doesn't let me live.
I don't want to see him anymore.
Ok, but you should speak with him.
But I can not!
So should I tell that you don't want
to speak with him?
No, wait a bit.
- Juli, go to bed, I'll speak with him.
- And? What will you say to him?
That's my business.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Juli doesn't want to see me?
So she sent you to kick me out.
But I won't leave till I
can not speak with her.
I have to see her,
it's very important.
I see that you like Juli.
Yeah, yeah.
I don't know who you are, but you should
understand I need to see her, now.
You know, I made a decision.
A huge decision.
And this is important for Juli.
I was at the doctor.
I can not...
I can not live
without Juli and Zsuzsi.
Do you believe me?
You have to believe me!
Come with me.
We go upstairs.
Don't be afraid, I'm not drunken.
I haven't touched a drop.
And I'm leaving in a minute.
I told you that I do not want to
see you anymore.
I'll live a normal life, and
I do not believe in you anymore.
Last time you were dunken
but you promised...
Juli, you are right, but
look at this, my love.
Here are the papers from the hospital.
The psychiatrist told that
I'm a etilismus-sympthomatico...
- Ok Janos, do not fool around.
- But Juli, you have to believe in me!
I'm going to a hospital.
And I wanted to see you once more.
Juli, believe in me.
Last time.
No! Last time was 150000 times,
and everything started again.
Go away!
Please Janos go away!
Anyway I said a lot of good things
about her at the psychologist.
If you do not leave, then I would.
No, wait!
Talk!
I can not bear him.
And I won't come back till he is here.
- Do not be so unmerciful.
- You should not give me any advice.
- You will never understand it.
- Juli, wait!
I brought her chocolate.
Sorry for my question, but
by the way who are you?
I'm her friend.
She is living here.
Living together?
So you give her this place,
but what does she give you?
Friendship is not business.
Right, yeah.
Your husband!
- Is he alcoholic?
- Oh, no.
This room here remind me
to a former place of us.
Juli had a lot of sunspot, and
we were very happy together.
You know, we belived so much.
I do not exactly in what, but
we believed so much...
Then my friend came here to Pest.
He wanted me to come with
him, but I didn't come.
I wanted the countryside. I needed
the sunspots of Juli.
<i>Tell me, why is she
sure of herself?</i>
<i>One can not feel confident
that much.</i>
I do not think that
she is so confident.
She loves you.
- Really?
- Aha...
I really love her.
And we will never divorce.
Do you know that she is 30?
Yeah, she is 30.
You can not tell.
Despite she looks like a child...
and her hair.
She is so funny.
And do you know, that
this 'child' cheated
on me a lot of times?
Yeah, yeah
When I asked her first time and
she said it's true,
I felt myself old and ridicuolus.
I beated her.
She didn't tell you, did she?
She told that.
Do you know why I am here?
It's not my business.
So, the reason is...
I want to tell her that,
I won't drink anymore.
It's a bit ridiculous, but
I want to give her something.
Because if I can not give anything,
It would be a big problem.
That's what I can give her:
I won't drink anymore
Ok, I can understand you, but
I think Juli is tired of you.
- Juli?
- Ahamm.
She is stronger than all of us,
believe me.
Where does Zsuzsika sleep?
In that room.
Here.
How are you?
- I heard your voice.
- Did I not let you sleep?
I will take you away with mum soon,
and we will live together again.
It will be great. Believe?
I brought you chocolate.
- Just wait a bit and I will
take you away, right? - Ok!
Sleep now.
It's late.
I knew that you are here.
Zsuzsi and your friend are sleeping.
- Did Zsuzsi eat something?
- Yes.
I gave Zsuzsi a bit of chocolate,
aren't you angry of me?
There will be problem, Mari is here.
She is sleeping.
Walls are so thin.
- Finish it.
- No, I won't.
No, Julika.
We are just guests here.
I love you.
I love you too.
Mari do not be angry.
I don't know anything about your husband.
We haven't spoken about it.
- What should have we speak about?
- I do not know, but...
But I think you do not understand, why
I made love with Janos.
Stop it.
I do not know what do think,
I tried with others, but...
but I can really make
love only with him.
Your wedding is not
too good neither, but...
I think you should understand this.
I tried to finish this
relationship many times
because I fell myself
weak when I'm with him.
When do I always go
crazy when I meet him?
- Ok, do not talk about it.
- Why?
Because idiots talk about it.
Mari... sorry for the question,
but you make love with your husband...
- according to a plan?
- Finish it!
Sorry, I'm sos sorry.
Sorry for my questions.
- Finish it!
- Are you crazy?
Mari, Marika, wait!
Forgive me.
You looks angry.
No, I'm just a bit tired.
We met once.
Do you remember?
For example when you were
at the supermarket with Juli.
- I said hello, but you did not notice me.
- Really?
I've got an idea.
Let's drink a coffee.
But everything is closed now.
Next time.
Mari.
Why are you laughing?
I'm not laughing on you.
20 years of marriage
and the first time
when somebody kissed me
who is not my husband.
- And?
- Nothing.
Hey, are you crazy?
I've never had a shower in cloths.
- Good evening.
- Hello, and you?
Go.
- Are Julis still living here?
It's good that you are here.
- How long are they going to stay?
- They haven't got any home, you know.
I'm leaving to Mongolia soon,
we have to speak.
- Take a seat.
- Listen...
we should...
we should talk about...
Come and sit down next to me.
- Pardon.
- Are you here? You'll be late.
- I won't go to the trial.
- Do not be fool.
If you do not go there,
then they will fire you.
Then fire me for this if they can.
But then you have to leave
the dormitory.
I won't leave. This spy is not right
if she thinks that she can do anything.
- You are coward.
- Me? Coward?
Yes, you are coward.
- Where do you want to go?
- She knows where.
She is in this situation because of me,
she showed her ass to Mrs. Berek.
Where is she going?
Mari?
I should go to the trial, but
she goes instead of me.
She is a good person, isn't she?
Do you want to be a hero?
I know what i'm doing.
You do not know, so I have to.
- Why are you doing this? It's her trial.
- Mine too.
Why do you not go to the trial?
Are you afraid?
Not I'm not, but it
does not interest me.
- They can fire you.
- Then I'll be fired.
If they can. It's my private stuff,
it's not the factory's business.
What do you think?
Why is it not the factory's stuff?
Neither the factory's nor your stuff.
You bring your child here.
And you live here at my wife, and
it is not my stuff.
It is Mari's and my thing.
Mari.. your girlfriend.
You should care your husband and
daughter. And leave as soon as possible.
You shouldn't deal with my wife.
I understand this. The only problem is
that you do not understand your wife.
Ferenc you live together for 20 years,
and you do not know anything about her.
I think you are the reason
why your husband drinks.
One can not live together
a woman like you.
Yeah, that's true.
I've heard many times
that it is impossible to live with me.
So it doesn't bother me.
One can not imagine that your
husband can beat somebody.
But as I'm talking with you,
I can understand him.
Do you hate me?
As much as you hate me.
You won't believe me,
but I do not hate you.
I only want that you deal with your
wife, not only with your work.
- Is it clear?
- What are you talking about?
- I can tell you if you want.
- No I do not want.
I'm not interested in your opinion,
I've got mine.
I can believe...
that you have your own
opinion about things.
Your fascinating opinion.
- You are going to Mongolia, aren't you?
- Yeah, is it a problem?
I can give you an advice.
You should learn to ride
the horse in Mongolia.
- What do you talk about
with your friend? - Anything.
- How long does it take to
get to Mongolia? - 8-10 days.
We change to Trans Siberian
Express in Moscow.
Probably there will be a possibility
to visit us during the summer.
By plane.
We have never live
so far to each other.
How many times have you cheated me?
Me?
Never.
But you kissed somebody else.
- I can see that you cheated on me.
- Don't be foolish.
I'm sure that other woman likes you.
- Ah, yeah.
- Do not turn off, wait.
On Monday I was in cinema with Juli.
I was very nervous so she
proposed to go to cinema.
You know she is the first friend in
my life, whom with I can really talk.
We saw a very old silent movie.
The characters dropped cakes
and kicked each other asses.
It was so amusing.
And a friend of Juli came
to the cinema at the end.
I said I was tired and
wanted to go home.
And this man came with me.
We walked and it snowed.
And suddenly he kissed me.
Are you angry?
Somebody else also likes you.
So, you can believe that
you are not old yet.
The only thing which was strange
that it was so good.
Like I would have gone
crazy, I started to laugh.
He thought I was laughing at him.
Then I went along.
But he came after me,
touched my shoulder and
He kissed me again.
So you cheated on me.
Oh, how can you ask this?
Come to sleep in the bed.
Come.
Are you not asleep?
Staying a bit more?
When you feel tired
go to bed upstairs.
Dad.
How are you?
Are you bored?
Would you like some?
Someone has to be sober.
That boy is full drunk.
We should send him home.
Do not talk about it now.
Enjoy yourself!
And get off my back!
It will be easier also for you.
I do not need surveillance.
Go and dance!
Ahh, you wear your best shirt.
Look at its cuff...
Yes, I ironed it.
Let's drink.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
Let's go dancing.
Let's drink another one.
I clothed quite well, didn't I?
I would wear another jacket
if you want.
Why don't you laugh at me?
What's the problem?
Laught a bit!
Be happy!
Zsuzsika is happy too.
What is it Mari?
Something wrong?
Why are you staring at me?
You have never seen a drunken woman?
- Yes, I have.
- Then give me a cigarette.
Certainly, Here it is.
Shhh, it works with fire.
Oh, we're going to home.
If you have some problem,
just call Janika.
Juli help me a bit.
Come! We go to your room.
Janos leave us a bit.
Come, I help you to go upstairs and
you will sleep a lot.
Feri said he would come.
He did not come.
- Forget him!
- Don't you understand, he decieved me.
I won't go back to him.
Because I'm not that kind!
- Janos, there is another month.
- He promised me to come.
Come, come!
Let's go outside!
Juli, come, sit here.
I have enough of this shit.
What do you think about yesterday?
Why do you not answer?
Look at me!
- What is you problem?
- I've enough of you!
Do not shout with me...
It is a good thing that you could
come home. I'm leaving next week...
You know that I had to be there and
you promised to come.
You had to be there...
you poor devil.
You think this work fits you?
You're ridiculous when
you act like a boss.
Finish it! Please!
What should I finish?
You don't like to hear it?
Then listen to your friends,
they will tell you other things.
Two idiot chics.
- Just think! Who are you?
- I was waiting for you.
I didn't feel to go.
I'm tired and worked a lot.
I'm bored of your trips and you.
You come home drunken. Disgusting.
You have never loved me.
- Never.
- Ahh the speech about love.
But you are at the dormitory and
I'm here. We hardly see each other.
You have never loved me.
Just give me those fucking eggs,
why do you hold there?
Isn't Juli here?
No, they went to go for shopping.
- Would you like to wait them?
- Yes, if I do not disturb you.
No, no.
Stay please.
- Take a seat.
- Thank you.
- Coffee?
- No, thanks, I'm so nervous.
Then palinka?
Yes, please.
- And you won't drink?
- No.
But you would like to
drink, wouldn't you?
Yes.
And how can you bear it?
What can I say? Hardly.
You can imagine.
I knew that it wouldn't be easy.
But what can I do?
- Another one?
- Yes, please.
Oh, sorry.
I met a doctor a few months ago
on a train.
I was drunken.
Not totally drunken, just tipsy.
So I became very friendy.
I loved everybody, started to chat.
So I became humanist.
So we talked all over
the night till morning.
And during that night,
I did not drink anything.
I was nervous.
- We talked about...
- Can I..
We talked about everything,
about my work..
About Zsuzsi, Juli...
At the end he said: There is
only one way of being abstinent.
With strong will.
And he also said that...
he can help me.
He is the director of such hospital.
At the country.
Work-therapist kind of thing.
And you decided first time, that
it is your will.
- Another one?
- Yes please.
I think it will be tough.
Yes.
But anyway, I go there, and
he can do anything he wants with me.
I would like to work somewhere, where
it is not enough to imitate the work.
Yes, it's a kind of new part,
with modern technology.
You wouldn't believe, but
i'm a good worker.
My face is hot, when
somebody else drinks.
You know the situation is that...
I'm not interested in money
if I like my work.
And what are you reading now?
What is a lonely alcoholist reading?
Poems.
Listen.
<i>Újévi köszöntő
by Mihály Vörösmarty</i>
Mari.
I know that there is a problem,
but listen to me.
And you will quiet down.
Listen, another poem.
Ok.
Feri is going to Mongolia.
But I do not care about it.
I'm happy about it.
We spent only a few days without
each other in the last 20 years.
I was beautiful and blonde.
In the factory where I worked,
people told me that
I was so beautiful.
And probably I was.
Feri noticed me and came
into the factory whenever he could.
He was a kind of boss there.
He started at the factory quite young.
Then we were engaged for 2 years.
We got married out children
were born.
My mother lived with
us and helped a lot.
We lived as we could.
We changed our flat sometimes.
And finally we bought a house.
And now...
The house...
That house is empty.
And I'm also empty.
You know i'm afraid of mentioning you
but I feel that I've never made
love in my whole life.
I've never really enjoyed my life
and I've never really cried.
There was no passion in my life.
And this is the end of this.
I think.
So suppose that...
you start to live as you really want
from this moment.
Then what's going to happen?
Will you come back to Budapest?
You leave the dormitory?
You will be with Feri? What for?
You just said that you
don't love him. So?
It's high time to talk
about your 'love'.
Or you relationship will be
a horror that you will also call love.
It will be cooking...
cleaning, ironing for you.
Am I right? I asked, am I right?
- Yes, you are.
- So I am.
Then your wide bed...
will be this kind.
You will see how tight will it be.
And I tell you what you will do
at the end. First you will take pills.
And then you will drink a lot.
And then?
- And then you will be alcoholic.
- Stop!
- I'm afraid of you.
- But why?
I'm just telling you the truth.
And it is not only about you.
Everybody is afraid of
the truth the most.
I'm afraid of solitude, because
I'm old and very tired.
Mari, that is not right.
You are beautiful.
Your face.
Everything.
Yes, you are beautiful everwhere.
- I'm leaving.
- Your coat?
Ah, that's it.
What should I say Juli?
- That I was here.
- Oh, ok, so you were here.
I can not understand you.
I want to be alone a bit.
And what will be here
in the next year?
- With the family, the house.
- We've talked about it.
- Everything will be ok with the house,
with the children...
I'm a bit nervous,
what has happened?
Have a good trip!
Bye.
He talked about a hospital, a doctor,
we should take him there.
You can not believe in him.
He decided to finish drinking many times.
- And it ended always like this.
- Janos, Janos!
Come, we will take him to the hospital.
Come! Help me!
Stand straight!
- Juli, I love you.
- And I hate you.
Stand straight!
Hold him! Understand?
- I'm ok.
- Congrat.
Come on!
Come on girls! Hurry up!
I told it to you, don't look at me!
- Come, we should go.
- No.
Come.
I don't want. I've seen him like this.
I do not believe in him anymore.
I do not want to go there.
- I know that you will come with me.
- No.
- Go there alone!
- Come on!
- Tell him that I'm sick or anything.
- Come on!
- No.
- Come on!
If you don't come, you'll tell yourself
that you are the reason why he fails.
Mum, let me go there.
Ok, go there, if you want.
Zsuzsi, I'm going in and
you wait for me here, ok?
I will be back in a minute.
Smell it.
Take a deep breath.
Keep going please.
Keep smell it.
Can I give you fire?
You know there are two therapies.
The gist of the first one
is the Pavlov's 'conditioned reflex'.
They give you apomorphine injection.
It takes 40 minutes and you have
to smell alcohol during this time.
- I don't want to talk about it, please.
- But listen!
You have to smell alcohol and
also taste it.
You have to repeat this procedure
10 or 12 times,
to make you hate alcohol.
Anyway we wake up early in the morning
and work therapy is going on.
The gist of the other method is...
Mari, why Juli is not here?
She felt herself badly and
there were problems in the factory.
You don't believe it.
And how is your husband?
He is ok.
He works in Mongolia.
But why?
Once I explained it.
I fully explained it to you.
And... where is Juli?
- You feel poorly, I call the doctor.
- Why Juli is not here?
- Come, go to the bed.
- Ok, right.
You know...
Juli never loved me, that whore.
Wait.
She is a kind of bitch who
uses her body to think.
Why are you here?
Nobody asked you to do so.
You are just the same.
Why are you here?
Who called you?
I do not need your help. You should have
gone to Mongolia with your husband.
Go away! I do not need you!
Understand?
Go away you stupid bitch!
Stupid bitch! Stupid bitch!
Go to sleep please!
Come here friend!
She came here to regret us!
Look at her, how good she is!
She regret us!
Look! That how a stupid
bitch looks like!
Whore! Whore!
- Come with me!
- Whore! whore!
- Finish it! Can't you hear?
- Whore! whore!
Calm Janos!
Come on!
Finish! Go to sleep!
Finish it!
Calm down!
I will give you your pills in a minute.
Calm down!
Enough, finish!
How is Janos?
Fine.
I thought there was some problem,
I was so nervous.
It's not true! It's not true!
Zsuzsi, where are you going?
It's not true! It's not true!
Zsuzsi, stop!
