How does anyone
get to this size
without just being
so out of control?
She's worked very hard
on a destructive path.
It's really hard to be my age
and have a weight problem.
I don't like that feeling
of being hungry.
Gee, I want a steak.
She could end up
being bedridden
and not even be 45.
It's scary to think
of what would happen
if she keeps continuing
on the path that she is.
Struggling with our own grief.
A parent should never
lose their child.
She's very fragile.
I'd give her
the least chance of success.
It scares me that,
what if I fail?
She has tried for so long
to try to do something
with her weight.
Then she gives up.
That's the last person
that I thought
would say something like that.
Do I feel like Sharon
wants her hand held?
Is that an apple pie?
Where is the trash?
Ugh!
Yes.
She's gonna be going back
into a household
full of enablers.
Thank you, Danny!
I don't think she's fully faced
everything that's
gonna need to change.
You've been drinking.
What happened to this girl
that took her to this place?

When I wake up in the morning,
it takes me a good 30 minutes
just to get my body
to where it can, you know, move.
Okay.
When I come down the stairs,
I'm just always so afraid
I'm gonna fall.
Just embarrassing.
This is what I've allowed food
to do to me.
I feel there's
this big sign on me
that says, "loser."
Yeah.
How does anyone
get to this size
without just being
so out of control?
When I was younger,
there were times
we just didn't have any food.
I remember specifically
a time when we had gone
three days without eating.
I think I've carried that
with me,
that I just... I don't like
that feeling of being hungry.
Daddy's cooking us some steaks.
You did good, honey.
This looks yummy.
She's always had a problem
with her weight
ever since I met her.
A lot of times,
I would have to step up
and kind of do things
with Michaela and the boys
to kind of keep things going.
I tried to be there for them
as much as I could,
but I've been overweight
their whole life.
They really haven't known me
any different.
Yes!
I need a shot.
So dumb.
What do you want?
Starting off with a Vegas bomb.
- Vegas bombs!
- Hello, ladies!
It's hard.
It's really hard to be my age
in the society that we live in
and have a weight problem.
I got her on vodka.
I'm like, "try it."
Vodka, pineapple, cranberry,
it's my favorite.
I don't want people
to see that,
inside, because of my weight,
that I'm weak,
so I put on a front
like I have no worries.
We're getting
a sister shot too.
Me and my sister, you know,
we'll go out to the bar,
have some drinks,
you know, do whatever.
Thank you, Danny!
It's like a nonstop party.
That was a fun night.
We had way too many shots.
Ooh, the Singapore rice?
So try that.
It's got curry in it.
I have kind of been really
careless with my eating,
just kind of whatever I want.
Sometimes I'm like,
"why did I just eat that much?
Why did I just
eat this meal?"
Like, I can't answer
the questions
of why I'm doing
the things that I'm doing.
When Brian came down,
I was like, "Chris,
are you coming down too?"
And he's like, "no."
He's like, "you partied for
two weeks straight last time.
I can't hang out
with you."
She wants to find
the right man so bad.
She wants to be married.
She wants to have children.
Where she's at right now,
it's just not gonna happen.
It's really hard
to live with my father.
And it just...
It sucks.
So what's up tonight?
We're gonna go out and party.
So what's the excuse
for going out tonight?
I like to go out and drink,
dad.
It makes me happy.
Dad, I'm not doing this
with you right now.
Please, stop.
It was really hard to choose
between an alcoholic father
and a drug addict mom.
You have been drinking.
That's my second one.
No.
My parents' divorce
was really hard on me.
I try to block a lot of it out.
I lived with my mom,
and she was married to a man
who was very abusive.
I have five sisters
and one brother.
I got more of the abuse
because I spoke up.
I guess,
'cause I was the oldest,
I felt like
it was my responsibility.
Like, Ashley and I never
get sick of each other.
No, we really don't.
Me and my sister
formed more of a Bond
than maybe someone else
would have with their sibling
because of everything
we've been through.
Oh, yeah.
Those are gonna be good.
I've always wondered,
you know, why...
we grew up during
the same thing.
Why did I turn
the way that I was?
You know,
why did I turn to food?
She always says
she doesn't want to waste food,
so she always cleans her plate.
If I don't eat all of my food,
then she's willing to eat mine.
Good stuff.
It's scary to think
of what would happen
if she keeps continuing
on the path that she is.
So I just melt the chocolate.
This is so I can drizzle it
and make it look pretty.
It is true
that I eat when I grieve.
After my mom passed away,
I gained 100 pounds.
But this past year just kind of
turned our world upside down.
I have a 19-year-old son,
Landon.
When he was 13,
he was diagnosed with bipolar.
In August, he had gone
to visit his brother at college.
And his brother
went to work one night,
and Landon found his gun,
and he shot himself.
We're struggling.
We're struggling
with our own grief
and, you know, just trying
to hold a family together
after such a devastating loss.
Since my son has passed away,
which is now eight months ago,
I've gained 60 pounds.
I know it's been two years
since I've even been
to the doctor.
You can step up.
With the death of your son,
that had to have been
a terrible time for you.
And it's quite common
for depression
to make it even harder
for you to get moving
in the right direction.
Sharon, she's a little older
than some
of the other patients.
Her body mass index is
a little higher to start with.
At this point,
she's very fragile.
Your body mass index is 58.
Normal is 20 to 25.
It's a dangerous problem.
It's accumulative risk.
Getting control of it
as early as possible
is important.
I think she's in big trouble.
I'd give her
the least chance of success.
You know, he just always
wanted to see me get healthy.
So I want to make sure
that I do that
for my other children.
I need to be there for them.
Miss Ashley Greely?
Let me get your weight
real quick.
Big breath in and out for me.
Ashley, she has
a family history.
Her father
has had a heart attack
two or three times,
so that's a pretty significant
risk factor
in and of itself.
Your weight, your obesity,
and your family history
are two factors
for developing heart disease
or having a stroke.
The most concerning thing,
of course,
is her other behaviors.
She may have a tough time
staying the course.
The outlook where
you're young, and life is fun,
and don't worry about tomorrow,
that's gonna hurt you.
- Thank you very much.
- Nice to meet you.
Never, like, sat down
and had somebody
tell me that before.
It's... it's my life.
It's the only body I have,
and I'm treating it like crap.
I don't want
to be a spectator anymore.
I'm gonna miss you a lot.
My daughter
is only ten years old.
I want to be here when
she graduates from High School.
I want to be there
when she gets married.
This is the lowest
I've ever felt in my life.
My father's an alcoholic.
I feel like
I'm turning into an alcoholic.
If I keep going down
the way I'm going,
there's gonna be
a lot of health problems for me,
and I don't know where
that might lead to.
I want to be able
to enjoy my family.
Nothing like losing your child
will make you realize
that life is too short.
- I love you.
- I love you.
I have to get control
of my life before it's too late.
I have to.
Love you!
I feel that
I'm just driving
into a lot of unknown,
but this will be
a new beginning.
This is the first day
of a major start of my life.
And I'm just...
I'm ready for it.
Well, this will be your room.
Thank you.
Oh, my gosh.
Look at how beautiful it is.
Hi!
Hi, I'm Britny.
Hi, Britny.
I'm Sharon.
Hi.
How are you?
I'm Britny.
Britny, nice to meet you.
I'm Ashley.
You can never
fully prepare yourself
for all these life changes
you're gonna have to make.
If it were that easy,
maybe some of them
would have already done it.
Did you bring any food,
any extra snacks and things
that you thought you might need
that we need to take out?
Right now, there's a lot
of distractions in their life.
At this facility,
we're gonna eliminate that.
They're gonna have to make
a complete lifestyle change.
- Phone turned off?
- Yes, turned off.
Wallet.
It's gonna be quiet today,
but stay excited.
- Okay, bye.
- All right.
I don't think
they have any idea
what really is to come.
Thank you.
All right.
Think of your worst fears.
That's what they're gonna
have to overcome day one.
She was nice.
Okay, that's good.
You ready to see David
and britny?
We got to get
all pumped up for them.
I know.
Good to see you!
The individuals in the program
are paired up
to give them the opportunity
to work with someone else
that's going through
the same thing
they're going through.
We're gonna go fantastic.
There you go.
That's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna do fantastic.
Let's get this party started.
All right!
I like it.
Young, fresh.
See?
Gonna keep you lively.
So high knees
moving through the water
whether you're
jogging, walking.
Honestly, Sharon,
I think she's nervous
about a lot of things.
Are you kicking your Booty?
I'm trying.
Just line your knees up.
Sharon can't even
walk up a flight of stairs
without being
completely exhausted.
All right, get all the way
to the end.
Get all the way to the end.
My struggle with Sharon
is gonna be to move her body.
All right, so pull that leg
to the ground.
The scariest part, to me,
about making this commitment
really wasn't about the food.
You either got to go up more,
or you got to go forward more.
I've allowed myself
to be very sedentary.
Kick!
Big splashes, big splashes!
Kick, kick, kick, kick!
I thought, "how in the world
"am I ever gonna be able to do
the exercises that
the trainers are gonna require?"
Good, try not
to drop your arms.
Nice.
Beautiful.
Beautiful.
I'll take that. 16.
Come on. 17.
Let's go.
You're gonna feel
lots of core, okay?
So here we go.
So you got a minute here,
and go.
Ashley is a very hard worker.
We're not locking out.
So beautiful.
Physically, I am wondering
what happened to this girl.
Push, feel those lats
in the back,
like when you were swimming,
same muscles working there.
Ashley, because of her youth,
she pushes.
All right, ten, nine, eight.
But you know what?
She has her own problems.
- You feel nauseous?
- Mm-hmm.
I was very sick.
When I got up this morning,
I felt very bad.
My stomach hurt.
I threw up a little bit.
I was shaky.
I did drink a lot.
You know, if I'm being
completely honest,
the alcohol part
is not 100% out of me yet.
I talked to britny,
and I mentioned the alcohol.
I went out five nights a week
and drink.
You go out five nights a week?
How long has that
been going on?
At least a year.
And I smoked too.
Ashley is very open
about alcohol, her lifestyle,
partying like a rock star.
I think that's probably
my biggest challenge,
is the not drinking.
Very excited that she would
just speak it out loud,
so that now maybe
we can get it out there
and work through it.
Go, baby, go, baby, go!
Come on, Ash, come on!
The first few days
were really rough.
Pull that water.
Come on,
all the way to the end.
All the way to the end.
The working out was like
a complete body shock.
You are sore.
There you go.
Go, go.
Seven.
- Yes.
- Eight.
Nine.
Ten.
You're almost there.
Come on.
Don't stop.
Don't give up on me.
You know, the more
that we're able to do
in our exercises,
then they move it up a notch,
and then your body is being
pushed a little bit more.
Fssh!
Come on!
One, come on.
It's starting to sink in
that it's reality.
Three, two.
Oh, yeah, one.
Don't stop on me now.
Sharon has a lot of problems.
Step.
There you go.
Like you're going through
that water in the pool.
Her son committed suicide,
and she beats herself up
about it.
Here you go.
Here you go.
The thing that
I still struggle with the most
is the negative talk
in my head.
You know, I got
a lot more to work on
than just, you know, my body.
Just... Sharon!
Here we go, baby.
Here we go.
Brush those inner thighs.
Brush, brush, brush.
It is really tough.
And I'm in suspense
a little bit
on what's, you know,
gonna happen,
but I've never, ever
had so much determination
in my life, ever.
Ever.
Ashley, weight was 296.
Go ahead and step on the scale.
Today, your weight
is 290 pounds.
- Oh, thank you!
- I'm so proud of you.
- Oh, my gosh.
- Thank you.
This is what
you're doing this for.
Come on up.
354.8.
- Dang, mama!
Whoo-hoo!
You can't slow down.
You can't slow down.
I feel very empowered,
and we definitely
need moral support
to get through
the workout sessions.
Let's go on a walk
or something.
Go on a walk?
Yeah.
My buddy, Ashley,
is just full of energy.
She's very positive.
We are gonna be looking great
by the time we go home.
We clicked right away
and a really good Bond
in the beginning.
- Did you put your sunscreen on?
- No.
I wonder how many calories
that burns.
We have a lot
of heart-to-heart talks.
So what's partying
gonna look like now?
Partying without drinking?
You can do that, Ashley.
I know I can.
I am looking at this time here
as a time to heal.
I've got
a lot of healing to do.
What I want you to do
is just tell me more
about yourself.
Then we'll go from there.
Okay.
Eight months ago, Landon,
he chose to take his own life.
As a mother,
what did that do to you?
Shook me to the core,
because I don't know
how to process this.
What did your son Landon
tell you to do?
He said, more than anything,
he wants me to be healthy.
What a great memorial
for your son.
I will tell you
that when he said that,
it filled me
with a lot of fear.
Okay, so now this foot
has got to come over.
Can you do it?
This might be high.
If I'm going to do something
to honor my son's life,
that something
I need to do with perfection.
There you go.
Now your foot
has got to go in there.
I can't see it.
Okay, got your left foot
in there?
Losing weight
is the hardest thing for me,
and it felt like
a lot of pressure.
Can you do it?
If she doesn't
start to give herself
some more credit
and some more love,
she is going to fail.
Oh, you were almost there.
I just love him,
and I miss him,
and I just want
to make him proud.
Let's go ahead
and come off this thing.
We'll get here one day, okay?
And it just scares me.
It scares me that,
what if I fail?
So it's four laps,
whether you are walking,
race walking, running,
but it's a race against you.
Go.
I think a little bit
of my competitive side
has come out.
Nice, Ash!
It's not a competition,
but you push yourself.
Push it!
I can push Ashley
as hard as I want,
and she won't back down
to a challenge.
I mean, she is all in.
One, two.
You're almost there.
Three.
Two, one, go.
Go, go, go!
Oh, yeah!
Did I think that
I could swim 60 laps before?
No.
Not a chance.
Good takedown, Ash.
When we're in the workout,
she's just doing circles
around me.
Yes, walk it off, baby.
I push her, and she pushes me.
Come on, Sharon.
Sharon and Ashley are putting
in a lot of extra effort.
They are putting in more classes
and more time.
It's very impressive.
You're almost there!
13:25!
Good job.
Stand up.
Hands on the head.
Breathe.
Your body is just so forgiving
of the abuse that it takes.
Good job, Sharon!
I feel so much stronger.
Push away with your chest.
I'm kind of getting confidence,
like, okay, if you're
giving this to me to do,
then that means I can do it.
And...Ahh.
It's very empowering.
Good job, Sharon.
Good job.
Let's see where you are today.
343.8!
All right!
Yeah!
Let's go ahead
and have you come
step right over here for me.
Ashley, your weight
is now 281.4.
That's crazy.
The things that I can already do
this far along...
like, bring me more.
What's... what's next?
Good job.
You're amazing.
Hello?
Hey.
Hi!
What are you doing?
Oh, working.
What are you doing?
Do you have shin splints?
Yes, they hurt really bad.
My sister is my biggest
support system.
She and I get through everything
together.
What did she say?
My stepmom,
she had a lot of rude things
to say about me:
That I'm not gonna make it,
that I can't do this.
I'm trying not to cry.
So you don't cry,
and I will try not to cry.
Okay.
I love you.
I love you too.
Bye.
You got it, baby.
You got it.
Go.
- I can't do this.
- You are doing it.
You just can't do it
at the speed you were doing
the other stuff.
We're almost done, okay?
And fast.
My workout was a lot harder
than I thought
it was gonna be today.
What is it?
Talk to me.
Tell me something.
I don't know.
I just don't feel like
I'm doing good enough.
Like, my body is shaking.
My muscles hurt.
Don't stop!
Don't stop!
Five seconds!
Three, two...
you got it, baby, awesome.
No, give me one.
You owe me one good one.
I think today
was really because, my stepmom,
she thinks
that I'm gonna come home,
and then I'm gonna fail.
That's the last person
that I thought
would say something like that.
Whoo!
It's a really tall step.
I know.
Okay.
I think the food that I buy
is healthy.
I just think the way
I prepare it is unhealthy.
I am really looking forward
to being able to go home
and make some of my own
food choices.
I think that's gonna
be empowering,
and that's gonna be part
of me learning
how to make this
a forever change.
Well, welcome
to the grocery store.
So I'm gonna show you
how you can shop healthy
and on a budget.
We're also gonna look at some
of the common food pitfalls.
My role is to help them learn
about proper nutrition,
learn how to make
good decisions,
and know how to navigate
the food they encounter
in the world.
So here's
a reduced fat cheddar.
Let's get a normal cheddar.
Five grams of fat versus...
- Nine.
- Nine grams.
So twice as much fat almost.
Twice as much flavor.
So with Sharon,
she seemed to think
that there weren't that many
bad things she was doing.
What do you normally put on it?
Butter and cinnamon
and sugar and marshmallows.
Okay.
She did fess up to,
well, you know,
"I feel like I have to add
a lot of butter to these foods,"
because that somehow translates
into love for her family
and friends.
This would probably
be two servings.
- Two servings?
- Yeah.
Out of all of the tools
that have been given to us,
the most difficult
to really grasp
has been food portion.
The recommended serving size
for a potato
is about the size
of a computer mouse.
So this is a real serving
of potatoes.
Sharon, you look
so disappointed.
In a sense, I feel like
I am like the alcoholic.
I don't see anybody
eating potatoes that small.
I feel like I'm gonna
have to be very stringent
on what I allow into my body.
"This week, I dedicate
to my son Landon.
"Saturday will be
his first birthday
I will celebrate
without him here."
I decided to dedicate
this week to Landon
because of his birthday
and commit this journey
that I'm making
to getting healthy to him.
Seven, six.
That was very scary to me.
I didn't want anything
attached to Landon's memorial
being a failure.
Open your eyes for me.
Open your eyes for me.
Your abs are in,
like you're waiting
for a punch.
It's taken me a few weeks
to feel strong enough to say,
"you know what?
I can do this."
I'm really gonna make it
to the end.
Pull that water.
Pull, pull, pull, pull.
This week has been
her best week.
She pushed herself through
tears and sweat, everything.
And she didn't stop.
Get it, mama, get it.
Two...
"I pray for discipline,
"perseverance, grace,
"and strength
to stay strong in this journey,
"so I can make you proud.
You're forever in my heart.
... Mom."
Okay, so let's see.
You're going home
at 336.2.
30 pounds in 26 days?
Whoo!
Landon's biggest wish for me
was to get healthy.
You know, I wish
that I could have done it
while he was still here.
This is just the beginning.
It's been a good week.
I really do miss him.
Okay, sweetie.
You are 274.8.
Total for the month,
you have lost
22.2 pounds.
22!
So much has happened in one,
like, short amount of time.
What's gonna happen
in the next five months
and then for the rest
of my life?
I'm really excited.
No tears.
You promised.
When did I promise?
Our job was to put tools
in the tool belt
but send them home
to use them themselves.
There's a reset period
for identifying what
the problems are for a month,
and then the challenges
are at home.
The thing
that scares me the most
about going home
is just failure.
The ultimate failure for me
would be giving up.
Sharon has been on a journey.
She's going home,
and she's gonna face
some obstacles.
Mama's home!
Her family wants to eat
the way they want to eat,
the way they've been eating.
It's gonna be a hard task.
While I've been here,
I've been working really hard
to get a good head start.
And when I go home,
it sucks to go back into
your old habitat,
and a lot of things
will be the same.
She's still gonna struggle
with alcohol and food.
I don't think she's fully faced
everything
that's gonna need to change.
If my dad is drunk,
I'm gonna be pissed,
because I asked him
specifically,
"do not drink
for this thing, please."
I'm very antsy right now
to get home.
If my dad is drunk,
I'm gonna be pissed,
because I asked him
specifically,
"do not drink
for this thing."
Home.
I had a whole month of detox,
cleaning out,
no drinking, no smoking,
no eating bad food.
And then I come home,
and my dad is still drinking.
He was already drunk.
I was slowly killing myself
by eating this food
and putting this stuff
inside my body.
Ashley's gonna be going
back into a household
full of enablers.
Hopefully, you know,
she doesn't get
put into the same situation
that she came out of.
The first week,
I went through a little bit
of an alcohol detox.
All my friends were there.
I made a statement
that I love them,
but I have to have
more of a relationship
than just a drinking
relationship with them.
Please, do not ask me
to come out and drink.
If you drink around me
right now,
I can tell you,
I'm not strong enough yet.
I want to wait
until this is over.
Sharon, how are you?
- I'm good.
- Come on in.
This is gonna be your gym
from now on.
Okay.
Give me two more good ones.
Ready?
Hold it, hold it.
It's kind of weird
getting back into life.
You know, 'cause there's
too much to do.
My son needs things for school,
and my husband is like,
"I've been waiting for you
to get home
so you could take care
of it."
Get out there.
One more.
One more good one.
One more good one.
It's like, oh, yeah,
I have responsibilities.
Have fun at the grocery store.
Okay.
Do you like tropical?
- Get the sugar-free,
though, honey.
I was just thinking,
"wow, this is a lot
to have to do
right when you get home."
140 calories.
Like, I already know
what my favorite things are,
and now it's like
everything is new,
and everything is different.
Okay.
Here's the scary aisle.
This has 10 more calories.
I don't need
that much popcorn, mom.
Some of the things that
I thought was healthy before
wasn't really so healthy.
There's just...
there's too many choices
and too many unknowns.
Thank you.
I'm exhausted.
Now I have to go work out
again.
Will you go get
the other part of the computer?
- Mm-hmm.
- Please.
The computer part
of the computer?
Yeah.
I have been independent,
except for,
I have had a weakness,
and that's my dad.
He's still eating
the bad foods,
still drinking.
You know, I have
to make a point to him
that I'm serious.
If I stay here,
I feel like I'm gonna
sink back down into it.
Ashley has made
very mature strives
as far as who she's gonna
accept in her life
for what she needs to happen.
My friends, they still went
off and drank and stuff,
and it's like, they didn't want
to hang out with me
because I wasn't drinking,
and when something
is toxic like that,
you just need
to get away from it.
Okay.
260!
- 260.
- 260!
I've come way too far
to turn around
and fall back to that place
that I was unhappy.
Tight, tight, tight.
Make it burn.
My very first week home,
I lost over 8 pounds.
- You ready?
- Okay.
326.8.
Not enough.
But then the next week,
I lost 1 pound.
You know,
that was discouraging.
You're okay, seriously.
You're gonna lose weight.
I promise.
- Okay.
- Okay?
The most frustrating thing
during this process has been,
you've worked hard,
and the scale doesn't reflect
the numbers
that you're wanting.
It's very discouraging.
You know, right now,
it's really hard,
especially after going
into a controlled environment,
to go home
for the next five months.
I want to make sure
that Sharon's staying on track.
Hi, Sharon.
Hello!
How are you?
Good.
How are you?
Good.
Is that an apple pie?
- It's got potpourri in it.
- Ohh...
I'm gonna check
her refrigerator.
I'm gonna check her pantry.
And I'm gonna make sure
everything is on the up and up.
We can throw those away.
Where's that trash?
Ugh!
You know, I think just because
I've had so many years
of dieting experience,
that, you know,
"I know everything."
Obviously, that didn't
work so well in the past.
It was nice to see you again.
Nice to see you too.
I'm really trying to draw
on the expertise and knowledge
of the people that
are surrounding me right now.
All the way up.
- Do a push-up.
Row with the right arm.
I work out every day.
Get up at 6:30 in the morning
with my trainer,
and I'm still pushing
just as hard as I was
when we started.
Hey!
Hey, Ashley.
- How are you?
- Good, how are you?
Good.
Come on in.
Ashley knows what's important.
She wants to take care
of herself.
New place, huh?
She's got her own place
with her sister.
They control the food
that's present in their house.
I brought a couple snacks,
'cause I know that's a common
thing with everybody,
is just finding
some different ideas
that are healthy.
This is a sargento
string cheese.
I like this choice
because it is reduced
in fat and sodium.
This tastes like I'm eating
normal cheese here.
It's actually really good.
Good.
Push ahead.
Ashley can make this happen.
Do I think she's gonna struggle
with a lot of things
that she says she's done with,
she's over with?
Yes.
- I'm just gonna take it
step-by-step right now,
and it's only gonna get better,
because I'm not stopping.
I still have more to go.
Okay, then.
Okay, this is different.
Just gonna go right, left.
Right, left.
One, one, two...
I've been able to do
every single thing
the trainers have asked me to do
except for one,
and that was the bicycle.
Now your foot
has got to go in there.
I can't see it.
She couldn't do it recently
on the bike at the gym.
You know, at her weight,
she didn't think
it was possible.
I get to see Sharon today.
We're gonna do something
different and new for her,
which is going biking.
- Hi!
- Hello!
What's up?
How are you?
Put your leg over.
There you go.
Like that.
Oh, there goes your car!
- I know that it's
nerve-racking,
so what are you
having trouble with?
As determined as I was,
it was a very frustrating
process.
Ah!
I really want to do this.
- You do?
- I do.
Yes!
Yes, I've been wanting
to ride a bicycle.
I did it!
Whoo!
This isn't hard.
I feel changed
from the inside out.
Oh, my gosh.
This is so fun.
I can't believe
that I've come so far
in such a short period of time.
You're going too slow.
This girl wants to ride.
Pull, two!
There you go.
Every single day,
there is a small victory.
I can just tell
I have so much more
stamina and mobility.
Nice big waves.
Big, big, big, big, big.
It leads me
to have a lot of hope
for what's to come.
Two more.
Good.
For the first time,
I can honestly say,
I see myself at my goal weight.
Look at that.
Yes!
I'm out of those 320s.
- Want another one?
- Yeah, another round.
Another one?
Another round?
On yours?
I said I wasn't gonna
get back into the bartending
and waitressing,
but I can't get full time
right now.
No mayonnaise or anything?
I haven't been able
to find a job
that would work with
my schedule of working out
and stuff
and, you know,
the time that I need off.
Ashley's idea for employment,
I don't feel like
that's a positive move for her.
She has a lot of willpower,
but I don't know many people
that are able
to be in a drug house
and be a drug addict
and not do drugs.
She's putting herself
back in an environment
that's gonna be really
challenging for her to overcome.
It's an alcoholic in a bar.
It's good money right now,
and it'll help me
get to where I want to be,
but it's a little scary
to think about being back
to where I was.
- Hey!
- What's your name?
Ashley Greely.
There you go.
This is your chip.
Okay.
Wear it on the front.
The pins are in the bag.
Have a good time.
- Okay, thank you.
- Thank you.
We are doing a 5k.
What's up?
Are you ready?
I'm ready.
Ready as I'm gonna be.
I haven't ran for 20 minutes
for a very long time.
Here you are.
Get set.
I spent a lot of time
changing my life
this past few months
and getting myself into shape
because this is gonna be
part of my life
for the rest of my life.
Ashley took it
to the next level.
Once she decided to say,
"hey, look, you know what?
I have a drinking problem,"
it really did work.
Basically,
I just had to tell myself,
"you've come soar, Ashley.
"What are you doing?
Why are you doing this?
This is ridiculous."
You know, I want to succeed.
I want to be healthy.
And bartending
and waiting tables,
you know, I was just like,
I do not want to put myself
right back
in that same situation.
How are you feeling?
- Tired.
- We're almost there.
Okay.
I never thought I could run
3.1 Miles without stopping.
And I did.
I ran the whole thing.
And that right there
just gave me
a huge boost of motivation
and self-confidence.
- Great job.
- Oh, thank you.
Great job.
All right, awesome.
10.
Two more.
Come on, you're going for 12.
Two more.
One more.
We won't be weighing them in.
So can they make it this month
really relying on
the knowledge and the tools
that we've given them
to really test
what they're made of?
Ashley has been dealing
with food addiction,
alcoholism, enablers,
but she's removed herself
from these situations.
She has no excuse at all,
and she is gonna
have to be successful.
Three more.
Sharon, right now
is a real big test for her.
Hips up, hips up.
She is not gonna move forward
without being able
to overcome the grief
that she's dealing with.
- Nice!
- Oh...
If I start running
into too many roadblocks,
I just shut down.
It's gonna be tough.
I can't.
A person can only
go through so much
before they break down
the bad way.
This last month,
it's no excuses, all choice.
Final weigh-in will be
a true statement
about what they've decided
to do with their life.
Two, one.
Good job.
Oh, my goodness!
Damn!
- Hello.
- Hello!
Wow.
I just had to look at you!
I just had to look at you!
How do you feel?
Do you feel awesome?
- I feel wonderful.
- Good.
I even got these jeans
two weeks ago,
and they're too big for me,
so...
Ashley, this is
a real moment of truth.
You started at 296.5.
- You were heavy.
- Yeah.
You say you lost 100 pounds.
I hope so.
Yeah.
Okay.
You were originally
296.5.
Today, you are at 205.2.
- 91.3 pounds!
- 91.
That's good enough for me.
That's from 300 pounds.
I'm extremely happy
with where I am.
I've lost almost 100 pounds.
My main motivation
from the beginning
was to look in the mirror
and have respect for myself,
and when I look in the mirror,
I have respect for myself.
I want to say thank you
for the opportunity
to work with you.
Congratulations.
And I wish you
the best of luck, Ashley.
Don't forget how strong you are
and what you just did.
Thank you.
I'm just gonna continue
to go to that gym,
work out, eat healthy,
and get to where I want to be.
Hey, Sharon.
- Hi!
- Look at you.
Unbelievable!
- Wow, mama!
- Who are you?
Oh! Ah!
You're looking amazing.
You've put in the work.
No one could ever say
you didn't work
and bust your tail for it.
What was her first weigh-in,
britny?
366.4.
It was pretty heavy.
It was almost 400 pounds.
Sharon, I just want you
to step on.
There we go.
Her weight today
is 255.6.
255.6!
2 more pounds, 110, baby!
110!
- Yes!
- Yay!
Where did you go?
- Good-bye forever.
- Uh-oh.
Where did you go?
My son has been with me
every step of this journey.
I feel certain that
he is looking down from heaven
and just saying,
"way to go, mom."
We've added some years back.
And now I can
so outrun my husband.
Yes!
Yes!
I feel wonderful
about what I've accomplished.
But, you know, I'm not gonna
stay here for very long,
because Tuesday,
I hit the gym with my trainer,
and, you know, I've got
another 100 pounds to go.
- Sharon!
- Ashley!
Oh, my gosh!
It's so good to see you!
Oh, you look so good!
I'm so proud of you.
You had so many obstacles
to overcome.
I had 100% faith in you.
I knew that
you were gonna do this.
We both had some pretty
good reasons to keep on.
- Yeah.
- And I'm not done.
And I know you're not done.
I am not done.
Let's finish this.
- So much to be happy for today.
- I know.
I am so much stronger
than I was six months ago,
not just physically
but mentally too.
Thank you so much
for inviting me here.
I'm gonna be vulnerable
with you,
and I pray that
that opens your heart.
They are hosting
a women's retreat here today.
It will be my first time
to share publicly
my story about Landon.
When his teacher
first recommended
that I have him tested
for ADHD...
It is truly mind-blowing
to realize where I started
only a few months ago
and where I am today.
I know that I'm never
going back.
It's a very good feeling.
Your health is the best gift
you can give
not only to yourself
but to everyone in your world
around you.
I like how open it is,
'cause it's got the tv on
over there,
and just, you know,
this is, like, really perfect.
Look at the closet!
I'm ready to settle down
somewhere.
Like, I'm ready to find me.
This is very good
for a new chapter in my life.
I am looking for
a top-to-bottom makeover.
Fun!
I've dropped almost ten sizes.
Now when I go to the store,
I feel... I feel like
a normal person.
I think I'm leaning
more towards
the jeans and a cute shirt
or, you know, like,
a nice sweater and a jacket.
The person that I was
when I first got here
was a very unhappy person.
I was lost.
I was upset.
I was compulsively drinking,
eating whatever I wanted to.
Today I've learned
to deal with things and move on
without having the food
and alcohol to be my drugs.
This is the one.
I have 50 more pounds to lose.
I'm not stopping,
because I'm strong enough
to continue to do this
on my own
and reach the goals
that I want to reach.
We release the balloons
that celebrate his life,
not his death.
I put a card on the balloons
with my son's picture
and a little bit
of how we feel about our son.
Make sure that everyone
has some balloons.
I feel changed
from the inside out.
Of course, that's what Landon
wanted for me
more than anything else.
One, two, three!
Let them fly!
Whoo!
It's exciting
to get rid of the old.
And it's gonna be exciting
to bring in the new.
