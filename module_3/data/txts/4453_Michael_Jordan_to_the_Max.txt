Michael Jordan to the Max (2000)
Synced: Marc2008 (Mrt-2011), The Netherlands.
What time is it?
Game time! Whoo!
From North Carolina...
at guard, six-six,
Michael Jordan!
Everyday that I stepped on the basketball court,
even though I was on top of the world,
I felt like I had something to prove.
I wanna be like Mike
I wanna be, I wanna be like Mike
Yeah, hey, hey
/ I wanna be I wanna be like Mike
Yes, I do
I wanna be I wanna be like Mike
Oh, oh-oh, ohh, yeah
I wanna be I wanna be like Mike
Li-Li-Li-Like Mike
I wanna be like Mike
You got to be like Mike
Be like Mike
You gotta be like Mike
Be like Mike
You gotta be like Mike
Be like Mike
After Michael Jordan's final season,
the N.B.A. gave him yet another
Most Valuable Player Award,
and said the reason is simple.
"After 13 seasons,
you still go out every night...
and play like Michael Jordan.
When Jordan would go out
for the spotlight introduction,
he would look up into the stands
and he would realize...
that there was at least
someone up there that night...
who had never seen him before,
who would never see him again.
And this would be the one
Michael Jordan moment...
they ever had.
And he would say he was playing
for those people there.
We had a six-game road trip,
three cities in four nights.
Michael had had some spasms
in his lower back.
And we literally had to, you know...
carry him off the bus,
off the plane to the bus...
from the bus to the hotel.
You know, it amazed me...
He went out
and got 40 points that night.
This is the kind of player he was.
He wanted everybody...
to see his special skill.
And he didn't want people
that loved basketball...
not to have that opportunity.
When the playoffs began,
in his heart Michael already knew...
that these would be his last games.
But this would be
no nostalgic farewell tour.
He was determined to go out
on his own terms...
as a champion.
The Bulls' first-round opponents
were the New Jersey Nets...
young and full of hope.
Michael was dominant.
It was a three-game sweep,
built on mental toughness
as much as physical talent.
And for Michael,
the way to develop the mind...
had always been through the heart.
A lot of parents ask me,
"Well, what advice
would you give my kids?"
And my advice would be
let them just enjoy the game.
I think what they have to learn
more about at that young age...
is their love for the game.
And once they've developed that,
then the mental part is easy.
I didn't really get instruction...
until I was a junior in high school.
First, I just loved the game
and I let my skills develop.
So I believe in learning late...
playing early, but learning late.
Michael's love of the game was born...
in his hometown of Wilmington, North Carolina.
during long afternoons on the play grounds.
His older brother, Lary,
helped Michael hone his game...
in their epic battles of one-on-one
at their backyard hoop.
But Michael's first hard lesson would come...
when he tried out for the
varsity team at Laney High.
When I was a sophomore in high school...
like most high school kids...
you get all the energy and all
the motivation and excitement...
of making your varsity team,
which is a big thing.
Status is a lot when you're in high school.
So you can imagine
the disappointment that I got...
when I felt like
I should have made the team.
but then didn't make the team.
I'm crying,
I lost my emotions totally.
My mother came to me
and said,"Use that energy...
"to prove to the coach and to your peers
and your classmates...
that they made a mistake."
You give it your best.
You try so hard and you get to the point,
"I know I can do it"
And if you try one more time,
you are able to achieve it.
It's going
one step farther.
That's not giving up,
it's giving your best.
I only will walk away...
when I know I do not have
anything else to give.
The disappointment
was so deep, like a cut,
it struck the fire in me.
to make sure that I never endure
that type of pain again.
In these condround
of the playoffs...
Michael returned home
with a vengeance.
Playing the Charlotte Hornets,
It would be Michael's last professional appearance
in North Carolina.
It's always been a treat to come back home...
when you've grown up here and you go out
and become a man on your own.
And then come back home to show
what's evolved of that person.
For fans who had watched him since his days
as a Carolina schoolboy,
what emerged now was not just
the skill but the will power.
Those who remembered his raw potential...
now saw the results
of a lifetime of hard work.
He would go to J.V. practice and practice,
and then he'd go to varsity practice.
We'd play
ball games, and after
the games were over,
he'd run what we called "suicides"
or line drills...
he'd run those by himself.
I just maveled
at his work habits even then.
With his competitiveness
to go with all that dedication,
you know, it was something to see.
The weakest part of Michael's game on the offensive end...
was his shooting.
So he obviously mastered something...
that everybody said he couldn't
do when he came out of college.
And he didn't by shooting
and shooting and shooting...
and shooting consistently.
The other thing that people told him...
that he wasn't a really good defensive player.
And he found a way...
not only to become a great defensive player...
but the best defensive player in the N.B.A.
This guy said, "Those are my weaknesses.
I'm going to figure out how to make those my strengths."
And he didn't.
I got a glimpse,
really, of Michael Jordan...
and what he was all about the
first time lever coached him.
About two minutes to go in
the game, I called a time-out.
And we were down two... it was
right there in the balance.
And I had some
little powder on my mouth...
from where I chewed some gum
and chewed it so hard...
that it really had become powder.
And Michael grabbed a cup of
water and he handed it to me,
and he said, "Take a drink of this water.
"Clear that stuff off your mouth.
I'm not going to let you
lose your first game."
The level of faith that
I have in anything in life...
is taught to you from your parents.
It is a trait
that I would never
trade anything for.
And if I can
ever pass anything
on to my kids...
it would be
to be optimistic
about everything in life.
He was only a freshman at the
University of North Carolina,
but with the 1982 N.C.A.A.
Championship at stake,
his team's fate was in his
hands, And he never hesitated.
Goes back to Michael Jordan,
jumper from out on the left!
The Tar Heels are going to win
the national championship!
After I hit the shot,
my father came to me and said...
this was the start
of something big.
He didn't know what it was.
I didn't know what it was.
But I did believe him.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to flight 23.
Please make sure your seat belts
are securely fastened...
and extinguish
all smoking materials.
when you wish upon a star
Your dream will take you
very far. yeah
Michael came along
at a time...
when globalization
really was occurring...
and an explosion
in media was occurring.
And he helped drive
that explosion.
Yo, Mike,
what makes you...
the best player
in the universe?
Is it the haircut?
No, Mars.
Is it the shoes?
There have been so many things
that he has popularized.
the shorts, the shoes...
"Must be the shoes."
Money, it's got to be
the shoes! Shoes! Shoes!
I think Michael
has transcended
every boundary...
of gender and race
and age and sport.
I think he's becomes or of
apart of our everyday culture.
Like Mike
if I could be like Mike
I wanna be
I wanna be like Mike
Like Mike
if I could be like Mike
Oh, be like Mike
I've missed more than 9,000
shots in my career...
I think what made him
so specialas a marketing icon...
is that he was natural.
Today, when everyone
really tries to be like Mike,
they're tying so hard
to invent a personal,
I think that people
see through that...
and it doesn't stand
the test of time.
I've failed over and over
and over again in my life,
and that is why I succeed.
Good afternoon, everyone,
and welcome once again ...
to Bulls basketball...
playoff basketball...
as we move to the
Eastern Conference Finals...
the Bulls
and the Indiana Pacers.
These two teams were two and two
in the regular season.
But the rival really begins on
a Sunday afternoon in Chicago...
Miller and Jordan
and a cast of characters...
that is not afraid to win.
There's Michael, slips and falls
down, gets back up into the lane,
hops through, falls,
fires on the rim and it's good!
The Indiana Pacers...
with their outside shooting
and the physical play...
were a team custom-built
to defeat Michael and the Bulls.
In the first two games
of the series...
even though the Bulls
would win both games...
it was clear
that the Pacers would pose...
their first real test.
Rose backs in. Now, Rose,
stripped by Michael.
To Harper.
Harper on the run.
Lead pass, Toni...
Kukoc to Michael.
He dunks the ball!
Oh, my!
for the next two games,
the scene shifed to Indiana.
On their home court, the Pacers
would win game three...
behind their tireless guard,
Reggie Miller.
Lead pass ahead for Mark Jackson.
This is what Indiana wants.
They run to Miller
for three...got it!
In game four, the Bulls led
by a point in the final seconds,
when Miller and Jordan
would square off again.
Here we go...
McKey holding, looking.
Here comes Miller
to the top.
Miller, a catch.
Miller, a look...
he hit it!
Reggie Miller...
knocked it down.
Four-tenths
of secondlef.
Reggie, Reggie, Reggie...
Toni,
out near the time line.
Looking, looking, looking,
looking, looking, looking.
Got it to Michael.
And...
it went in and out!
Hit the board and spun out,
and Indiana wins the game.
With the series tied at two,
fatigue was taking
its toll on the Bulls.
And meanwhile, out West,
the Utah Jazz were rolling
towards the finals.
Led by future Hall of Famers
Karl Malone and John Stockton,
the Jazz dominated
the Western Conference playoffs...
and would have
ten days' rest...
while the Bulls and Pacers
continued to battle in the East.
The Bulls lost another game,
and would have to go
the full seven in a series...
for the first time in years.
By the end of game six,
doubters were saying...
that Michael was finally
running on empty.
Bulls trail by two.
Here we go.
M.J. one-on-one with McKey.
Michael a drive,
tripped off his feet,
and McKey stole the ball,
and that's going to do it.
That will do it.
Indiana's going to win it.
He may have been
devastated that night,
and I assume he was, but
he had the ability to believe...
that we were going to win
And he was going to do well.
Probably one of the
most remarkable shots...
that everybody remembers is the
shot he made against Cleveland.
The in-bounds pass
comes in to Jordan.
Here's Michael
at the foul line.
A shot on Ehlo.
Good!
The Bulls win!
They win it!
But they don't remember...
that the night before, he missed
three out of six foul shots...
that would have sealed
the game for us,
and we wouldn't have had
to go to the fifth game.
A normal player would have said,
"Oh, I cost us this opportunity"
and probably beat
themselves up over it.
Michael, the next
day that we played
Cleveland...
got on the bus and said,
"Have no fear.
We're going to win
this ball game."
If we sit here and worry
about what people think of us,
then we don't
have a chance.
They still got to come
through Chicago.
Utah, Indiana, they still
got to come through Chicago.
I don't care what happens today,
don't care what happened
in the other series.
They still got to come
through Chicago.
We will win game seven.
and the ball...Michael a steal.
M.J. on the run,
he will dunk the ball.
Michael was facing
the ultimate elimination...
lose, and end his career
on a note of defeat.
But despite Michael's promises,
the Pacers led
by 13 points early on.
Then Michael led the Bulls
on a furious rally.
He's loose, driving...
and dunks the ball, and a foul!
It was the kind of run
that had led the Bulls...
to their five
previous championships.
But there was still
a half of basketball to play.
Here we were in the conference finals.
In the seventh game,
we were down...
going into
the fourth quarter.
And I thought maybe... maybe
this is it...
maybe we've had
the last hurrah.
But something rose up in
these players, led by our hero.
He's the type of man that
could get you to jump off a bridge...
or at least
think about it
for a few seconds.
He has such a will
to accomplish a mission...
that everyone follows him.
Michael back to the top...
and now the switch made back by McKey.
Michael to the lane,
jumped out to Luc.
17-footer... bang!
Down the well it goes.
M.J. on the run,
to Kerr for three...
Good!
M.J.
Fall away jumper shot is good!
And a foul!
They may have had tired legs,
but Michael and the Bulls grew stronger...
in the game's final minutes.
Bulls win, 88-83.
They go to the finals again.
Michael, you're a tired man, aren't you?
I'm exhausted.
But that's what it took to go where we had to go.
I mean, everybody had
to leave it on the floor...
and there's no tomorrow,
it's the last dance,
so we got to give
everything we got.
They're rested,
you guys are fatigued,
but I know
you'll be ready...
to play on Wednesday.
Our hearts
are not fatigued.
That's the most
important thing.
All right, Michael,
great job.
Before making his final exit,
Michael had to take one more
walk through the spotlight.
Move a side and let
the man go through
Let the man go through
Move a side and let
the man go through
Let the man go through
Move a side and let
the man go through
Let the man go through
Move a side and let
the man go through
Let the man go
through, through
Move up
and let the man go
Let the man go
Move up, let the man go
Let the man go through
Move a side
and let the man go through
Let the man go through
Move a side
and let the man go through
Let the man go through
If you walk through
a crowd with Jordan,
you see the same thing he sees...
you see all the eyes aiming in.
And I asked,
"What do you see in the crowd?"
And he said,"Sometimes
I'll see a father and a son.
"They may not think
I've even noticed them,
but sometimes,"
Jordan will say,
"I wonder if they have any idea how much
I'd like to be them."
Last night
we began the show...
with the disappearance
of Michael Jordan's father.
Tonight, the worst fears
have come true.
James Jordan
was found dead...
the victim of an apparent murder.
When my father died,
I had him for 32 years.
I was very lucky.
I looked at it as being lucky,
not as being disappointed
that he wasn't around anymore.
I was lucky that he was there
when I needed him...
that he could infuence
my life to look at situations...
that I use to help make
my decisions to this day.
Some kids never have that.
Sure, I would love
to have him now, but...
people are put
on this earth for a reason,
and you utilize the time
that you're here.
You never know when that's
going to be taken away from you.
That's one thing
he taught me.
But while he's here,
or while they're here,
they should make an impact
on someone's life.
And he made an impact
on my life.
You're going to get it, man.
That's for bringing me
into this world.
After the third championship,
my father kept kind of hinting
towards me playing baseball
"Stop playing basketball.
Why don't you give
your baseball a shot?"
Because that's what he actually
got mestared playing...
when I was six years old...
I played baseball.
And he felt that
I could play baseball...
and do it with the same
conviction and attitude...
that I played basketball.
Everyday, the first person
there before the sun...
would be Jordan.
And he was there
because he wasn't good.
He would work
with a batting instructor...
and work all day long...
and be the last
person to leave
every night also.
Strike three!
Money's no Stan Musial.
But he's tring.
Say, hey,
he's no Willie Mays.
But he's tring, man.
What it did teach me was,
don't be afraid to try.
The worst thing that can happen...
is it doesn't...
it doesn't pan out
the way that you envision it.
But at least you know
that by giving it a shot.
People were basically saying...
that I didn't have no reason
being in the sport,
and I was degrading the sport.
When those negative things
started to happen,
the only thing,
I wish my father was there...
to give me the positive
reinforcements that I needed.
I asked him what it was like
for him in the morning.
And Jordan said,"I get up
before the sun comes up,
and I make myself
some breakfast by myself"...
he was down there alone...
"and I get in the car.
"And I'm driving
to spring training,
"and there's no one, really,
out on the roads yet.
"And I look at the seat
next to me and I see my Dad,
"and I talk to him.
"I think to myself,
Pops, we're doing this.
We're doing this together."
And the day would end,
and he would say
to the batting instructor,
"Can we do a little more?
"I think I'm getting this.
I think I'm learning this,
I think I'm getting this."
And that's when
Spors Illustrated
put him on the cover...
saying that Michael Jordan
has embarrassed baseball.
And as I would watch him
there ever night...
as the sun was going down and
the other ball players had left,
and I would see this guy
working to get better...
Michael Jordan working
to get better...
I couldn't help thinking that
if you ever have children,
you ought to pray
that they grow up someday...
to embarrass
you like this.
Michael Jordan...
hits a fly ball.
I think that experience itself
kind of gave him a blessing...
of coming back to basketball...
and understanding the gift that
he'd been given for this game...
that was so special.
By the hand of the Almighty
We fowered
in this generation
Triumphantly
Won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom
'Cause all I ever had...
When Michael came back,
and Jud and I were driving
down to the game,
and I said,"Jud, you know,
does Phil start Michael?
I mean, he hasn't been here for,
you know, 60 games, 65 games."
And Jud looked at me
And he said,
"Steve, as a general rule,
"when you have your own
statue outside the stadium,
you don't
come off the bench."
There'll be other great players,
there's no question about that.
But what he's done
for the game...
I don't think anybody
will touch his greatness.
and that's why everybody's
holding on here in the finish...
to just be apart of...
if this is the last run,
everybody wants to be
apart of it and witness it.
The Bulls had gone
to the finals five times,
and five times they had won.
The fact that this might be
Michael's last chance...
made these finals
the most anticipated ever.
The Jazz had earned
the home cour advantage...
on the strength
of their regular season.
And now,
the world tuned in...
to see if Michael
could beat the odds...
and win one last time.
Right here, right now.
Right here, right now.
Right here, right now.
Right here, right now.
Right here, right now.
Michael circles, spins,
hangs, fires, scores.
In game one, the Bulls
took the Jazz into overtime.
But in the end,
fresher legs prevailed.
The previous year,
although Utah had lost,
they had proven to themselves...
that they could play with the Bulls.
and then they win game one.
I thought Utah was going
to be the N.B.A. champions.
When everybody, in some ways,
didn't expect me to win,
and the odds
are stacked against you.
And for once in your life,
you are the underdog...
You know,
that was beautiful for me.
When he needed it most,
Michael didn't find comfort...
in the championship banners
he helped raise.
But rather strength...
from the seven years
of defeat that came before.
That was a long road.
It kept me in the gym in the
summer, working on my skills...
trying to be
the best basketball player
I could become.
But at the same time,
to show players who were
not on the same level...
with the same
mental toughness...
that,
if I'm going to do this,
then you have
to keep up with the pace.
And quietly,
it stared to turn.
He was your hardest worker.
He competed everyday.
That filtered down
through your team,
so as a coach...
you never had to talk
about the work ethic
of your team...
because your best player
always brought that.
Michael's standards
were too high...
for many
of his early team mates...
but then
came Scottie Pippen.
The infuence
of Michael on Scottie Pippen
was almost from day one.
Michael kind of
helped him get out there
on the basketball court...
and taught him some
little things... some of
the small tricks that he'd use.
as a consequence,
the two of them
really played well together.
It was
the Lone Rangerand Tonto.
There's no doubt about it.
Pippen became a star
in his own right.
and then there was
the supporting cast...
that Michael would
challenge relentlessly,
knowing that they too had to be
ready when their moment came.
He understood the fact...
that everybody had
to share in the game,
and that he was willing
to be part of this...
to sacrifice some
of his own game for that...
was the most
important thing.
He comes off,
I'll be ready.
I've gotten
a chance to play a lot,
and play a lot
in big games.
And I felt
the pressure, I think,
and didn't
perform that well.
And I learned how
to play with Michael
and how to hit big shots,
and how to relax myself
in situations like that.
Michael, in traffic, to Kerr.
Fifteen footer...
Yes!
What a great experience,
you know, to go through,
not just for basketball,
but for the rest of my life.
To know that I can
face something...
that's pretty
difficult,
and deal with it.
Back in Utah...
the buzz was still about the
Jazz's series opening victory.
But by the time
game two had begun,
game one was history
to Michael and the Bulls.
If Michael enjoyed
being the underdog,
he never let his team
feel like one,
driving them forward...
with the fair
and confidence of a champion.
The Bulls won game two,
and now the series
would move to Chicago,
tied at one.
I'd have to see someone beat
Michael Jordan four times,
because, I said,
to do that you're going
to have to dismember him.
You're going
to have to take
an arm and leg,
and you're going
to have to drag him
off the floor.
He's not going
to go easily.
These would be Michael's
last games in Chicago.
And game three played out like
a thank-you note to the fans.
Welcome to my world
Where I feel
most at home
Reasons will always change
But the meaning
still stays the same
Welcome to my world
Where I feel
most at home
Chicago's 96-54 win in game
three was the biggest rout...
in N.B.A. finals histoy.
The Bulls were two games away
from the title.
Pass the first time.
People say a lot of things
about our physical tiredness,
but our mental toughness
is there.
And I don't think
that should ever be over looked.
Okay, here we go.
Okay, let's go!
After dominating game three,
the Bulls' physical resilience
would be tested in game four.
Scottie looks.
Dumps it to Michael... M.J.
And turns base line...
Fall away jumper...good!
What a rainbow that was.
Kukoc drops to Michael.
M.J. spins along the base line,
goes up and scores.
And Kukoc looking,
looking, looking.
Luc to Michael. He catches,
two dribbles, spins in, scoops...
and scores!
Another win for the Bulls.
The countdown to the
championship had reached one.
Three-one...
Do you still feel
like you guys are the underdogs?
No, we're in
the driver's seat right now,
and, you know, we
just have to come out...
ready to play
next game,
and, you know,
try to put it away.
Before game five, the
celebration had already begun.
I said, come on
Baby, don't you want to go
Back to that
same old place
Sweet home, Chicago
Can I ask you,
how big does that look on IMA?
Does look like a gigantic bucket
of popcorn on an IMA screen?
It's a whole mountain
of it, folks.
All right, baby.
Come on, man.
...all for the heart...
and lay it out
on the basketball court.
When we come out of the court,
we're all celebrating,
and Joe's going to be happy.
Let's go, baby.
Before there was anything
to really celebrate,
Karl Malone and the Jazz
found an answer...
to every move
the Bulls made.
In game five,
the Bulls came up empty,
and Michael walked out of the
United Center for the last time.
Back in Utah for practice
the following day,
the defeat
was already forgotten,
for here was another secret
to the spell Michael had held...
over the rest of the league...
ever since
his first championship.
Even when the Bulls
weren't superior physically,
they had
a philosophicaledge.
I think Phil had a lot to do
with that with his Zen practice.
His whole emotional approach
to a game of basketball.
I've experienced
a lot of different coaches,
but he gave me
the understanding about life...
in a whole different frame.
I think his teaching
toward the understanding
of Zen Buddhism is...
how you view yourself...
to deal with the realities
of life surrounding you,
and somehow be able
to correlate that...
to a simple game
as basketball.
This is something
that we talked about a lot
as a basketball team,
is about how to be
in the moment.
Being able to visualize what
might happen in those times.
Michael so embraced this,
and I think that was
the beauty of his game,
is that he had all these
abilities to adjust,
not force his own
predetermined idea,
but allow those things
to come together for his game.
I tend to be calm,
things tend to slowdown.
As I go into situations that
people don't know the out come,
I've already
experienced them in my mind...
just playing
tricks with myself.
So it didn't seem new to me and
I wasn't afraid to fail with it.
Once I began
to understand that,
I became a master
of the game of basketball.
Game six in Utah.
for the Bulls,
a win would mean
the championship.
For Michael, it would mean
the cementing of his legacy.
Harp looking left,
not there... backdoor lob.
Michael goes up and scores!
The Bulls were still feeling
the effects of game five...
as a bad backgrounded
Scottie Pippen.
Pippen knocked down And he's
struggling to get back up.
Sets a screen.
Michael hangs in the air.
His jumper, good.
In Chicago, fans filled
Michael Jordan's restaurant,
and 23,000 of the faithful
filled the United Center.
Back in Utah, Michael
was operating on his own.
The celebrated teamwork
of the Jazz was clicking,
and Karl Malone and
John Stockton took charge
of the game.
After agrueling post-season,
the Bulls could no longer match
up with the Jazz man for man.
With a fourth-quarter lead,
the Utah crowd sensed...
victory drawing closer
with every basket.
for the Bulls...
the last man standing clawed
his way back into the game.
Come on, Bulls!
Seven on the shot box,
six, five.
Now Michael's got
to do it himself.
Jordan backing,
backing, pumping,
falling, firing, scores!
And a foul!
Ohh, my!
Harper back outside.
Michael firing,
sticks another three!
He had played nearly
every minute of the game,
and scored more than half
of his team's points.
But late in the fourh quarer,
Michael finally seemed
worn out by his effors...
and his shots faltered.
Hornacek running.
Hornacek for three.
Got it!
Still Michael kept coming,
kept shooting,
kept getting to the line,
kept the Bulls in the game.
You can do it!
Four championships in a row!
It was as if everything
he had ever accomplished...
had led Michael
to this one moment.
And in the final minute
of the game,
at the final minute
of his career,
he would need everything
he had learned along the way.
Pippen looking... dump to
Michael near the time line.
M.J. at Russell.
Michael a drive,
and the lay-up is good.
A driving lay-up by Michael...
draws the Bulls
to within one.: 86-85.
And now you got a chance
for a stop here.
Dennis and Karl are going
to get down on the post,
and they're going to do all
their little necessar banging.
Myself,
I focused on Karl.
Hornacek screens across.
Malone to the post.
While he's
fighting with Dennis,
he basically forgets
where the ball is,
and so I choose
this opportune time
to make my steal,
and I came back
to strip the ball away.
Malone stripped by Michael!
To the floor,
stolen by M.J.!
Michael a steal!
Sixteen seconds left.
Bulls down one.
Crowd gets quiet.
The moment starts to become
the moment, you know, for me.
Once you get in the moment,
you know you're there.
And when I saw the moment...
the opportunity
to take advantage of it...
I never doubted myself.
knowing that this was going
to be the last opportunity...
to either win the game
or lose it.
Michael against Russell.
Eleven, ten...Jordan.
Jordan a drive,
hangs, fires...
Scores!
Bulls win the title!
The Bulls are
the world champs again!
If that's the last image
of Michael Jordan,
how magnificent is it?
Oh, my God, that
was beautiful.
What a finish!
I had faith!
I had faith!
You bet you did.
We've come a long
long way together
Through the hard times
and the good
I have to celebrate
you, baby
I have top raise you
like I should
His sixth M.V.P.
this past season,
and his sixth M.V.P. in the N.B.A. finals.
Michael Jordan!
Michael Jordan's legacy
is authenticity.
if you removed all the hype,
all the marketing,
all the show-time glitz,
he would be as %100 genuine as anybody
who ever played in a gym...
or an armory
anywhere, anytime.
There's never been a player...
that's had that ability
that Michael Jordan's had...
in the kind of way he did it
in this game of basketball.
His legacy is a newborn child
ten years from now...
and a father says,"I wish you
could have seen Michael Jordan."
Thank you.
The dignity and grace...
with which you conduct yourself
off the court...
those are important things,
and I believe
those are enduring things.
You figure there've been,
I don't know, 25,000 years.
I don't know how you do
the math of that,
but that's like out of all 50,000
top athletes...
since, you know,
prehistoric times...
brontosaurus and
pterodactyls included...
he's right there.
Ten years from now,
20 years from now...
what I hear people saying,
or l would want people to say,
and it's simple...
that if Michael Jordan was still
playing the game of basketball,
he would dominate.
Welcome to my world
No matter what happens
in this business of basketball,
If we didn't get paida dime,
you still would play the game
of basketball somewhere.
Welcome to my world
Somewhere there's a kid working.
He won't skip any steps.
He will learn from my example,
just as I have learned
from others.
Welcome to my world
where I feel most at home
There will be a player
greater than me.
If you believe
I know you can
Make it happen for yourself
I can see it in your eyes
It's in your hands
So don't ever stop
This is your destiny
It's meant to be
For you to have
what you want
Hey, baby,
now is your time
For you to win
for you to fly
So let all your dreams
help you succeed
To another way of life
The one you long for inside
The one you thought
you'd never lead
If you believe
I know you can
Make it happen
for yourself
I can see it
in your eyes
It's in your hands
So don't ever stop
This is your destiny
It's meant to be
For you to have
what you want
If you believe
I know you can
Make it happen
for yourself
I can see it in your eyes
It's in your hands
So don't ever stop
This is your destiny
It's meant to be
For you to have
everything you want in love
