Another world, another time. -
- In the age of wonder.
A thousand years ago, this land was
green, until the crystal cracked.
A single piece was lost,
a shard of the crystal.
Then strife began,
and two new races appeared.
The cruel Skeksis,
the gentle Mystics.
Here in the Castle of the Crystal,
the Skeksis took control.
Now the Skeksis gather
in the sacred chamber. -
- Where the crystal hangs
above a shaft of air and fire.
The Skeksis with their hard, twisted
bodies, their harsh, twisted wills.
For a thousand years
they have ruled. -
- Yet now there are only ten.
A dying race,
ruled by a dying emperor.
Imprisoned within themselves
in a dying land.
Once more
they gather at the crystal. -
- As the first sun
climbs to its peak.
As the Skeksis ravage the land,
they draw new life from the sun.
Once more
they will replenish themselves. -
- Through the power of their source,
their treasure, their fate...
The Dark Crystal.
But today, the sun ceremony gives
no comfort. An emperor lies dying.
Today, a new emperor
must seize the throne.
A thousand years ago,
the crystal cracked.
Here, far from the castle. -
- The race of Mystics
came to live in a dream of peace.
Their ways were the gentle ways
of natural wizards.
Yet now there are only ten.
A dying race. -
- Numbly rehearsing the ancient
ways in a blur of forgetfulness.
But today,
the ritual gives no comfort.
Today, the wisest of the Mystics
lies dying.
Today, they summon the one
who must save them.
In the Valley of the Mystics
there lives a Gelfling, Jen.
The Skeksis killed his family
and destroyed his clan.
Only Jen survived, to be raised
by the wisest of the Mystics.
But there is a prophecy...
A thousand years have passed.
Now, once more, the world
must undergo a time of testing.
Now it must be healed, or pass
forever into the rule of evil.
At this time, Jen is the chosen one.
Today, Jen's pipe gives no comfort.
For today, his master lies dying.
And a journey must begin...
the journey of Jen.
- Master?
- When the three suns meet...
- Master, what's wrong?
- You are in danger, Gelfling.
- And I must leave you.
- Leave me?
- Master, no.
- I have told you of the Skeksis.
The Skeksis
killed my mother and father.
The story runs deeper
than you know. -
- And you are part of it.
I don't understand.
The Skeksis will vow to destroy you.
For the prophecy says
you must find the shard.
- The crystal shard.
- The crystal shard?
To save our world,
you must find the shard...
...before the three suns meet.
If not, Skeksis rule forever.
Where is it?
Aughra holds the shard.
Follow the greater sun for a day
to the home of Aughra.
She knows all the secrets.
Aughra?
Follow the greater sun?
But I'm only a Gelfling.
I should have told you these things
long ago.
Now it is up to you.
Remember me, Jen.
We may meet in another life...
...but not again in this one.
Master!
Don't leave me.
I hate your whimper.
Quiet!
He's not dead yet,
my Lord Chamberlain.
Kneel! Bow!
I...
I am still in power.
I...
I'll go where you send me...
...though I barely understand.
Dear friend, be well.
Receive your belongings,
receive them serenely.
Now we send forth Jen.
Watch over his dangerous quest.
Dear Master, I'll find the shard.
I'm not ready to go alone.
All right, alone then.
The Emperor is dead.
Which one of us
will be the new emperor?
My Lord Chamberlain,
time to choose an emperor.
- It should be me.
- Not him! I must rule!
- You should be the emperor.
- There's going to be a fight.
It's time to make my move.
It's me.
We're all with you.
- Chamberlain, wait! You can't!
- Get back, Spithead!
Lay down my sceptre!
I challenge!
- Trial by stone.
- Trial by stone!
Trial by stone.
Slaves, quick, the stone.
Pull!
Pull!
You whimpering worm.
- That did it!
- He can't beat that.
He's really mad now.
Me! The Emperor!
Now, by the law, he must pay.
Stop!
Yes.
Let him go!
The Chamberlain is banished.
Now, bow down to me!
- I am Emperor!
- Hail to the new emperor!
Listen, the crystal.
The crystal calls.
To the crystal chamber.
- A Gelfling alive?
- A Gelfling!
The prophecy.
The prophecy says
Gelfling will destroy us.
No!
Garthim, attack!
Garthim soldiers, find the Gelfling.
The Gelfling,
bring him to the castle.
Garthim, death to Gelfling.
Ugly, hideous Gelfling.
What in the world...?
This place is weird.
Let's see... her name is Aughra.
Follow the greater sun for a day
to the home of Aughra.
Some directions.
Who is Aughra, anyway?
One of these things?
Maybe she murders Gelflings.
What am I doing here?
A Gelfling!
- Are you a Gelfling?
- Yes.
My name is Jen.
They killed all the Gelfling.
You can't be a Gelfling.
You look and smell like a Gelfling.
Maybe you are a Gelfling.
- I'm looking for Aughra.
- Who sent you?
- My master, wisest of the Mystics.
- Where is he?
- He's dead.
- He could be anywhere then.
- Are you Aughra?
- Are you afraid of me?
Do you think I'm going to eat you?
What do you want of me?
- A crystal shard.
- Is that all, a crystal shard?
Drop him.
Aughra?
Aughra?
What's it for?
Is that what you want to know?
What is this all about?
You don't know?
Everything in the heavens is here.
Moving... as the heavens move.
This is how to know when...
that's what.
Suns, moons, stars...
Yes, the angle of eternity.
That's how I know it's coming.
How else can I make the prediction?
A thousand years ago,
there was a great conjunction.
I was there.
Three suns lined up.
The crystal cracked, and
the Skeksis and Mystics appeared.
Another great conjunction is coming.
Anything could happen.
The whole world might burn up.
The end of Aughra.
You'd better have your shard
before that Gelfling.
- Ask what the great conjunction is.
- What's the great conjunction?
You tell me.
The great conjunction is the end
of the world... or the beginning.
End, begin... all the same.
Big change.
Sometimes good, sometimes bad.
There it is!
- Gelfling knows nothing.
- What do I do with the shard?
- Heal the Dark Crystal.
- But how?
Questions, questions!
You want a shard? Here.
- Which one is it?
- Don't know.
Don't know.
There is much to be learned...
...and you have no time.
Which one is it?
It's one of these three, I'm sure.
You're taking too long. Hurry!
But how do I choose?
Yes!
Now that you have it,
you don't know what to do with it.
But Aughra knows.
Garthim!
Out!
Get out!
Get out!
Aughra!
At last, the crystal calls.
It is time to return to the castle.
Now I've got the shard...
but what do I do with it?
What is it?
Am I supposed to take it somewhere?
What's so special about this shard?
It doesn't look like...
I don't like this.
Oh no! Right in the mud!
Fizzgig!
- You are a Gelfling like me.
- Yes.
- I thought I was the only one.
- I thought I was.
Here, I'll help you out.
Here, I'll help you out.
The first thing I remember is fire.
It's a war, I think.
A tree. My mother puts me inside.
Mother!
The kind one picks me up.
He makes the monsters disappear,
and I be safe.
- What's happening?
- We're dream-fasting.
Sharing our memories.
- I'm having a bath.
- My new mom called me Kira.
Master showed me
the whole valley stretching out.
The Garthim captured the Podlings.
Master is my family,
teacher and friend.
I talk with the flowers
and all the living things.
He shows me numbers and words.
Everywhere I go I find kindness.
I learn from them all,
but there's no one here like me.
I love them all,
except I need to find...
Wait! It's going away.
- I'm sinking.
- Don't move.
Don't move? Where would I go?
- What is that?
- Just a Nebrey. She won't hurt you.
Kira! Your name is Kira.
We were dream-fasted, you and I.
Fizzgig, come on.
This is Jen.
Fizzgig!
- You seem strange to him.
- He seems strange to me.
He's nervous. Skeksis are watching.
We must go.
- Roast Nebrey, my favourite.
- I want the rare piece.
You slimefish!
Rotten!
It seems to me
that Gelfling has escaped.
No Gelfling ever escaped
from my deadly Garthim.
More food!
Dessert!
Not bad at all.
Look, the Garthim return.
The Gelfling.
Release the Gelfling.
Skeksis fools!
What do you want with me?
- This is no Gelfling!
- Of course I'm no Gelfling.
You putrid lizards!
I'll get my eye to you.
She was with him. Where is he?
He's gone. Stupid Garthim!
If you want the Gelfling, ask me.
Don't send crab-brained soldiers.
They burned my home.
My home's gone, the Gelfling's gone.
Dangle and strangle to death!
Watch your tongue.
We are lords of the crystal.
Lords? Not for long.
What about the prophecy -
- That a Gelfling
will end Skeksis power?
He'll come, make you
crawl like the worms you are.
Find that Gelfling!
Crystal bats, fly! Search the land,
the water and the sky.
Get down.
That was a crystal bat.
What they see, the Skeksis see, too.
- Did it see us?
- No, I don't think so.
Aren't these the people
from your memory?
When the Garthim killed my parents,
the Podlings adopted me.
This is Jen... Come.
How do you say "thank you"?
The three suns in the sky
are going to come together soon.
It's called the great...
the great something or other.
He told me I must find the shard
before then, and that's all.
Then he died.
- What's the shard for?
- I don't know.
- I found the shard...
- But you don't know what it's for.
Jen, this way.
Through here. Hurry.
- What was that creature?
- Skeksis.
Wait! They won't find us here.
- It's all my fault.
- That Skeksis...
He saved us from his own Garthim.
First Aughra's, then your village.
- I wish I'd never found this shard.
- No, Jen!
They hurt your arm.
Here, this moss will make it better.
It wasn't your fault.
The Garthim have always come.
Master, I remember the valley.
I didn't understand.
I miss the other masters
with the old magic and chants.
Out here in the world,
look at me...
I'm not a hero,
not the way you wanted.
Nothing is simple anymore.
Master...
Where are we?
- Safe.
- Safe?
I don't think
anywhere is safe anymore.
These are ruins.
They're the houses of the old ones.
You mean our ancestors?
Jen, here's the shard.
I can feel something...
hear it almost.
We don't go in here anymore.
Bad things happened in here once.
But they were Gelfling, like us.
They were all killed
by the Skeksis long ago.
Kira.
Look here.
That looks just like the shard.
What does it mean?
- What are those funny marks?
- This is all writing.
- What's writing?
- Words that stay, my master said.
"When single shines
the triple sun. -
- What was sundered and undone
shall be whole."
"The two made one
by Gelfling hand or else by none."
By Gelfling hand,
do you know what that means?
Wait!
This is a piece of the Dark Crystal.
Then that's what my master meant.
You have to heal the Dark Crystal.
Prophecy!
Stay... I'm a friend.
Stay. The prophecy
caused all this trouble.
That prophecy? Is that
why Skeksis killed Gelfling?
Yes! A bad mistake. Skeksis
were afraid, feared of Gelfling.
- But you're a Skeksis.
- I saved you from the Garthim.
- Why?
- Don't listen to him. It's a trick.
No, please. Listen.
I'm an outcast. If I make peace,
I'm an outcast no more.
- Will you stop the Garthim attacks?
- Yes. Please, come to the castle.
Show them you want peace.
Show them Gelflings mean no harm.
Please, please, please...
Jen, no!
Please, please... Yes.
No! Come on, Kira!
Wait, please.
Please, wait!
Please make peace!
- I have to get to the castle.
- I'll show you the way.
Over here.
- What's that?
- It's a Landstrider.
- How did you learn to call them?
- The Podlings taught me.
Don't be afraid.
Let's go.
They'll take us.
- Kira, you don't have to go.
- I know.
All right, together then.
No, Fizzgig, you stay here.
All right, come on.
Hang on, they go fast.
- The prophecy didn't mention this.
- Prophets don't know everything.
Silence, animals.
You're next, little Podling.
This won't hurt, we just
want to drain your living essence.
Then you can be the same as the
other Podlings here... a slave.
Open the wall.
Now, Podling.
There is the shaft of the castle.
Position the reflector.
The reflector will capture
the beams of the Dark Crystal.
Lock into the reflector.
Feel the power of the Dark Crystal.
Now the beam will rid you
of your fears, your thoughts...
...your vital essence.
You're very lucky. Only the Emperor
can drink your essence.
He is here. Close it.
- Is it ready?
- Fresh and strong, Sire.
It will make you young again.
Yes, young!
You fraud!
Liar! Slave squeezer!
It always worked better
when we used Gelflings.
- Look!
- The ones who raided your village.
Let's go.
Kira!
Come on.
- Are you all right?
- Yes. We've got to get them out.
Hurry!
Hang on.
Wings! I don't have wings.
Of course not. You're a boy.
Fizzgig...
A way into the castle.
This must lead into the lower part.
- I don't want to go in there.
- We have to go on.
Fizzgig, come on.
Careful.
- Which way now?
- I want to go back.
I smell death here.
I know, but we have no choice.
- Skeksis!
- I knew you would come.
Do not be afraid.
I am here to help you.
Come, show them
we can live together in peace.
Let go.
My hand!
So, my hand.
Gelfling, you'll die.
Let go of me. Jen!
- Let go.
- Gelfling, come on.
Fizzgig, stay with Jen.
Let go!
Let go of me!
Jen!
Chamberlain, get out.
Gelfling!
Gelfling!
Come and look,
such an ugly monster.
Royal Sire, I bring you Gelfling.
I have caught her.
I bring you the Gelfling.
I was wounded.
I suffered horrible pain.
A live Gelfling.
- We are sworn to kill all Gelfling.
- No, she's mine.
Sire, you could drink her essence.
Because of the prophecy,
we must kill the Gelfling.
First we take her essence,
then kill.
- Drain her first.
- Take her essence.
Drain her essence.
As for the whimpering Chamberlain,
return his robes to him.
Silence, animals.
There!
Yes!
Yes, essence of Gelfling.
Kira, fight them.
Fight them.
Jen.
Call the animals. You have the gift
to call them to freedom.
Quiet, Gelfling.
Quiet, all of you!
Stop!
Gelfling, free them.
Stop, all of you! Get down!
No!
Too late, Gelfling.
The great conjunction is at hand.
Now the Skeksis
will have power over the stars.
- When is the conjunction?
- Soon the three suns touch.
- Jen!
- Go, Gelfling. I fear to death.
Get down. Quiet.
A big help you've been.
Oh no!
Now where am I?
Garthim!
Is that the crystal?
- Aughra! You're alive.
- No time!
Single shines the triple sun.
Where's Kira?
The great conjunction comes.
Yes! The crystal!
This is what I came for:
The Dark Crystal.
The three suns.
The shard.
Kira!
The great conjunction comes.
Now we will live forever.
We will live forever!
We will live forever!
Gelfling!
Fizzgig, down.
Kill her!
She will destroy us.
Gelfling, you will die.
More Gelfling.
Garthim!
No!
The shard!
The shard is mine!
Fizzgig!
She has the shard.
- Take it from her.
- Watch out, Kira!
Behind you!
- Leave her alone.
- Just give us the shard.
- Yes, just don't harm her.
- No, Jen.
- Heal the crystal.
- Kira!
Jen...
Kira...
How did you get up there?
Come on then.
"What was sundered and undone
shall be whole. The two made one."
Now the prophecy is fulfilled.
We are again one.
Many ages ago,
in our arrogance and delusion. -
- We shattered the pure crystal.
And our world split apart.
Your courage and sacrifice
have made us whole -
- And restored
the true power of the crystal.
Hold her to you.
She is part of you. -
- As we all are part of each other.
Now we leave you
the crystal of truth.
Make your world in its light.
