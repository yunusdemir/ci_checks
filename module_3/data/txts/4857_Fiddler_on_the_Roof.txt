A fiddler on the roof.
Sounds crazy, no?
But here, in our little
village of Anatevka
you might say
every one of us is a fiddler on the roof.
Trying to scratch out
a pleasant, simple tune
without breaking his neck.
It isn't easy. You may ask
why do we stay up there
if it's so dangerous?
Well, we stay because
Anatevka is our home.
And how do we keep our balance?
That I can tell you in one word!
Tradition!
<i>♪ Tradition ♫ ♪</i>

<i>♫ Tradition ♫</i>
Because of our traditions,
we've kept our balance
for many, many years.
Here in Anatevka,
we have traditions for everything.
How to sleep. How to eat.
How to work.
How to wear clothes.
For instance, we always
keep our heads covered,
and always wear a little prayer shawl.
This shows our constant devotion to God.
You may ask,
how did this tradition get started?
I'll tell you.
I don't know.
But it's a tradition.
And because of our traditions,
every one of us knows who he is
and what God expects him to do.

And in the circle of our little village,
we've always had our special types.
For instance,
Yente the matchmaker,
For your girl.
Reb Nachum the beggar,
Get away.
And, most important of all,
our beloved rabbi.
Rabbi, may I ask you a question?
Certainly Leibesh.
Is there a proper blessing...
for the Tzar?
A blessing for the Tzar? Of course.
May God bless and keep the Tzar
far away from us.

Then there are the others in our village.
They make a much bigger circle.
We don't bother them
and so far, they don't bother us.
And among ourselves,
we always get along perfectly well.
Of course, there was the time
when he sold him a horse
and told him it was only six years old
when it was really 12.
But now, it's all over
and we all live in simple
peace and harmony.
- It was really 12 years old.
- It was six.
Tevye knows it was 12.
How do you know it was realy 12?
Twelve! Twelve!
It was 12!

Without our traditions,

as a fiddler on the roof!
Mama! Mama,
Yente the matchmaker is coming.
Maybe she's finally found a
good match for you, Tzeitel.
From your mouth to God's ears.
Why does she have to come now?
It's almost Sabbath.
Out, all of you! I want
to talk to Yente alone.
But, Mama, the men she finds
the last one was so old.
And he was bald!
He had no hair.
A poor girl without a dowry
can't be so particular.
You want hair, marry a monkey.
Even a poor girl without a dowry has
to look at her husband sometime.
A husband is not to look
at, a husband is to get.
But mama, I'm not yet 20 years old.
- Sha!
- I don't think I
Do you have to boast about your age?
Do you want to tempt
the evil eye?
Tup'-tup'-tup'
Oh, out, all of you.
There's work to be done before the Sabbath.
Hurry! All of you, hurry.
Golde?
Golde, I have such news for you.
And not every day in the week news.
Once in a lifetime news.
Mmm, Such diamonds, such jewels.
I'll find a husband for
every one of them.
But you shouldn't be so picky, right?
Of course right! Because after all,
even the worst husband, God forbid,
is better than no husband, God forbid!
And who should know better than me?
Ever since my husband died
I've been a poor widow, all alone, no one
to talk to, nothing to say to anyone.
All I do at night is think of him.
And even thinking of him
gives me no pleasure.
- Is Tzeitel in the house?
- Why don't you go in and find out?
Thank you, Bielke.
- Yet he never raised his voice.
- Er... Good afternoon.
Is Tzeitel in the house?
She's busy. Come back later.
But there's something I like to tell her.
Later.
Later Oh, all right.
What does that poor skinny
tailor want with Tzeitel?
They've been friends since they
were babies. They talk, they play.
They play? What do they play?
I don't know. They're children.
Oh, from such children come other children.
Motel is nothing.
Yente. Yente, you said
you had news for me.
Ah children, children.
They are your blessing in your old age.
But my Aaron, heh', may he rest in
peace, couldn't give me children.
To tell the truth, Golde, he hardly tried.
But what's the use complaining?
Other women enjoy complaining. Not Yente.
Not every woman in the world is a Yente.
Well, I, I have to go home now,
to prepare my poor Sabbath meal.
So er... goodbye, Golde.
And it was a pleasure talking
our hearts out to each other.
Yente, you said you had news for me!
Oi, I'm losing my head.
Someday it'll fall off altogether
and a horse will kick it in the mud
and good-bye, Yente.
Of course, the news.
It's about Lazar Wolf, the butcher.
A good man. A fine man.
And I don't have to tell
you he's well off, no?
Yes.
But he's Lonely, the poor man.
After all he's been a
widower all these years.
You understand? Of course you do.
So! To make it short,
out of the whole town, he's cast his eye
on Tzeitel.
- My Tzeitel?
- No, the Tzar's Tzeitel.
Of course your Tzeitel.
Such a match for my Tzeitel.
But, but Tevye wants a learned man.
He doesn't like Lazar.
Good, so Lazar won't marry him.
He wants the daughter, not the father.
Listen. Listen to me, Golde.
You send Tevye to him. Don't
tell him what it's about.
Let Lazar discuss it himself.
He'll win him over. He's a
good man and a wealthy man.
So! Let me know how it went.
A-And you don't have to thank me, Golde.
Because aside from my fee,
which Lazar will pay anyway
it gives me satisfaction
to make people happy.
True? Of course true.
So, er good-bye, Golde,
and you're welcome.
Good-bye, Yente.
Come! Come, children. Get
changed for the Sabbath. Hurry.
Hurry with your work.
I wonder if Yente found
a husband for you.
I'm not anxious for Yente
to find me a husband.
- Not unless it's Motel the tailor.
- I didn't ask you.
Tzeitel, you're the oldest. They
have to make a match for you
before making one for me.
And then after her, one for me.
- So if Yente brings som...
- Yente, Yente, Yente!
Well, somebody has to arrange the matches.
- She might bring someone wonderful.
- Someone interesting.
- Well off.
- And important.

Dear God, was that necessary?
Did you have to make him lame
just before the Sabbath?
Ah, that wasn't nice.
It's enough you pick on me
bless me with five daughters,
a life of poverty.
That's all right, but what
have you got against my horse?
Really, sometimes I think
when things are too quiet up there
you say to yourself
"Let's see. What kind of mischief
can I play on my friend Tevye?"
Aha! So you're finally
here, my breadwinner.
I'll talk to you later.
- So why are you late today?
- His foot went lame.
Well hurry up. The sun won't wait.
And I have something
important to say to you.
- I still have deliveries in the village.
- You'll be late for the Sabbath.
I won't be late.
You'll be late.
I won't be late.
I won't be late!
If you ever stop talking, I won't be late!
You can die from such a man.
As the Good Book says
"Heal us, O Lord, and we shall be healed."
In other words, send us the cure.
We've got the sickness already.
Well, I'm not really complaining.
After all, with your help
I'm starving to death.
Oh, dear Lord!
You made many, many poor people.
I realize, of course, it's
no shame to be poor
but it's no great honor either.
Ahh

if I had a small fortune?

Tevye, Tevye! Where's your horse?
Well, he decided to take the day off.
- Have a good Sabbath.
- Thank you, Your Honor, thank you.
- Tevye, you're late.
- Where's your horse?
- It's almost the Sabbath.
- You kept us all waiting.
What happened to your horse?
Look at this! Look what
it says in the paper!
- Look, look, look!
- What's the matter, Avram?
Sha! Quiet!
Quiet! Quiet!
Stop braying like a pack of mules,
and let a man talk. Talk, Avram.
Well my paper came to the post office
today like it does every week.
Though usually it comes on a
Thursday, but sometimes
Avram, that's not talking. That's babbling.
- Tell us the news.
- What does it say?
Quiet! Talk, Avram.
Well, I was reading my paper.
It's nothing very important a story
about the crops in the Ukraine
and this and that.
Avram, talk.
And then, I saw this.
All right. We all see it.
What does it say?
"In a village called Rajanka"
all the Jews were evicted
"forced to leave their homes."
For what reason?
It doesn't say. Maybe the Tzar
wanted their land. Maybe a plague.
May the Tzar have his own personal plague!
Amen!
- Ptooi! -
What's the matter with you?
Why don't you ever bring us some good news?
It's not my fault. I only read it.
"An edict from the authorities."
May the authorities grow like onions
with their heads in the ground.
Amen!
- Ptooi! -
What good will your cursing do?
You stand around, curse and
chatter, and you don't do anything.
You'll all chatter your way into the grave.
Excuse me. You're not from this village.
No.
Where are you from?
Kiev.
I was a student in the university there.
The university.
Tell me, is that a place
where you learned
how not to respect your elders?
That is where I learned there
is more to life than talk.
You should know whats going
on in the outside world.
Careful, my paper.
Why should I break my head
about the outside world?
Let the outside world break its own head.
Well put!
He's right. As the Good Book says
"If you spit in the air,
it lands in your face."
Nonsense.
You can't close your eyes to
what's happening in the world.
He's right.
He's right, and he's right?
They can't both be right.
You know, you are also right.
He's too young to wipe his own nose.
Good Sabbath, Tevye. The university!
- Here. Good Sabbath.
- Good Sabbath, Tevye.
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. I apologize. Here.
- Good Sabbath. Good Sabbath.
- Good Sabbath.
Tevye, the rabbi's orders.
Oh, of course.
So you're from Kiev, Reb er?
- Perchik.
- Perchik.
So you are a newcomer here, huh?
As Abraham said
"I'm a stranger in a strange land."
Moses said that.
Forgive me. Forgive me.
As King David said, "I'm slow
of speech and slow of tongue."
That was also Moses.
For a man with a slow
tongue he talked a lot.
Here, Reb Perchik.
Have a piece.
I have no money, and I'm not a beggar.
Take it. It's a blessing for me to give.
Very well. For your sake.
Thank you. Thank you.
You know, it's no crime to be poor.
Hum, in this world, it is
the rich are the criminals.
- Someday their wealth will be ours.
- Oh, that would be nice.
If they would agree, I would agree.
And who will make this
miracle to come to pass?
People. Ordinary people.
- Like you?
- Like me.
And until your golden day comes,
Reb Perchik, how will you live?
By giving lessons to children.
Do you have any children?
I have five daughters.
Five!
Daughters!
Girls should learn too. Girls are people.
- A Radical!
- Oh, go away.
I'd be willing to teach them, open
their minds to great thoughts.
Yeah?
I'd like them to know the Good Book.
Well the Bible has many
lessons for our times.
Perchik
I'm a very poor man
but, food for lessons, huh?
Good, good. Stay with us for the Sabbath.
Of course, we don't eat like kings,
but we don't starve either.
As the Good Book says, when a
poor man eats a chicken
one of them is sick.
Where does the Book say that?
All right, all right. It doesn't
exactly say that,
but someplace it has
something about a chicken.
- Good Sabbath! Good Sabbath.
- Good Sabbath.
- Did Yente find somebody?
- I don't know.
- Good Sabbath, children.
- Good Sabbath, Papa.
Children, this is Perchik.
Perchik, this is my eldest daughter.
Good Sabbath. You have a pleasant daughter.
I have five pleasant daughters.
- Ah, This is mine, and this is mine
- Good Sabbath, Papa. - Good Sabbath, Papa.
And this is mine
and this is mine, and this is mine, and
Well, this is not mine.
Perchik, this is Motel Kamzoil.
So, you did us a favor and came home.
Well, this is also mine.
Golde.
Golde, this is Perchik from Kiev.
He'll be staying the Sabbath with us.
He is a teacher!
- Would you like to take lessons?
- I'm a very good teacher.
I heard once that the rabbi who must
praise himself has a congregation of one.
Your daughter has a quick and witty tongue.
Well, the wit she gets from me.
As the Good Book says
The Good Book can wait. Get washed.
The tongue she gets from her mother.
Motel, you're also eating with us?
- If it
- Of course. Another blessing.
Tzeitel, Tzeitel, get the small table.
And Chava, the two chairs from outside.
Children, finish dressing.
You can wash at the well.
Hurry. Hodel, help them hurry. Hurry,
it's almost the Sabbath. Hurry!
Tevye.
Tevye, I have something to say to you.
Why should today be different?
Tevye, I have something to tell you!
Tzeitel, I have something to tell you.
- Motel, Yente was here.
- I know, I saw her.
If they agree on someone,
it will be a match,
and then it will be too late for us.
But Tzeitel, I have found someone who
will sell me his used sewing machine!
So maybe in a few weeks I'll have saved up
enough to buy it, and then your father
A few weeks might be too late.
Lazar Wolf wants to see you.
The butcher? What is it about?
I don't know, only he says it's important.
What can be important? I have
nothing for him to slaughter.
After the Sabbath, see him, talk with him.
Talk about what? If he's thinking
about buying my new milk cow
he can forget it.
- Tevye, I want you to talk
- Sssh!
Naam shekachn lo ashrey
haam sheaoonay elehave.
- Tevye
- Ashrey
- I want you to talk to
- Yushvey betecha
looch sela
What else can I do?
You could ask my father
for my hand tonight.
Now.
Why should he consider me now?
I'm only a poor tailor.
I'm only the daughter of a poor milkman.
Just talk to him.
Tzeitel, if your father says
no, that's it. It's final.
He'll yell at me.
Motel
I'm just a poor tailor.
Motel!
Even a poor tailor is
entitled to some happiness.
That's true.
Amen.
Amen. A man sends you an important
message, at least you can talk to him.
- I don't want to
- Talk to him!
All right! After the
Sabbath I'll talk to him!
All right. I'll talk to him.
Well, it's getting late.
- Where is everybody?
- I don't know, Papa.
Children! Come down, children!
We are lighting the candles. Children!
- Reb Tevye
- Not now, Motel.
Hurry up, children! Hurry up.
- Reb Tevye
- Not now Motel.
Golde!
Golde, the sun is almost down.
- Reb Reb Tevye.
- What is it?
Reb Tevye.
- Yes? Yes.
- Reb Tevye.
- Yes yes
- I
Well, Motel, what is it?!?
Good Sabbath, Reb Tevye.
Good Sabbath Good Sabbath.
Hurry up.
Hurry, children hurry.
It's getting late. Hurry.

- Cheiim.
- Tevye
- Yeah?
Er... I suppose you know
why I wanted to see you.
Oh, yes, I do, but
there is no use talking about it.
Er...
Tevye, I understand how you feel.
But
After all, you have a few more without her.
Ah, I see.
Today you want one.
Tomorrow you may want two.
Two? What What would I do with two?
The same as you do with one.
Er...
Tevye.
This is very important to me.
Why is it so important to you?
Frankly because
I'm Lonely.
Lonely?
Reb Lazar, what are you talking about?
How can a little cow keep you company?
Little cow? Is that what you call her?
What else should I call her? That's what
she is. What are you talking about?
Don't you know?
Of course I know! We are
talking about my new milk cow.
The one you want to buy from me.
A milk cow?
A milk cow so I won't be Lonely?
I'm talk I'm talking about
your daughter. Your daughter Tzeitel.
My daughter Tzeitel?
Of course. Your daughter Tzeitel.
I see her every Thursday
in my butcher shop
and she's made a very
good impression on me.
A very good impression.
Reb Tevye,
I like her.
Why don't we just shake hands
and call it a match?
And
I'll be good to her.
Tevye,
I
I like her.
Well?
- What do you think?
- What do I think?
Huh?
I never really liked him.
Why should I? You can have a
fine conversation with him
if you talk about kidneys and livers.
On the other hand
not everyone has to be a scholar.
And with a butcher
my daughter will surely never know hunger.
Maybe I misjudged him.
He's a good man.
He likes her.
And he'll try to make her happy.
What do I think?
It's a match.
- You agree?
- I agree.
- You've made me a happy man.
- Good.
- Let's drink on it.
- Why not?
- To you.
- No, my friend. To you.
- To both of us.
- To our agreement!
To our prosperity.
To our good health and happiness.
And most important of all
Er...

Mazel tov!

Tevye.
After
the marriage
we will be related.
You will be my
papa.
Your papa?
Lazar Wolf
I always wanted a son.
But I wanted one a little
younger than myself.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
I hear that congratulations
are in order, Tevye.
Oh, thank you, Your Honor.
Thank you.
Tevye!
Tevye.
Yes, Your Honor?
I have this resent news I think I should
tell you as a friend.
Yes, Your Honor.
I'm giving you this news
because I like you.
Ah.
You're an honest, decent person,
even though you are a Jew.
Oh, thank you, Your Honor.
How often does a man get
a compliment like that?
And the news?
We have received orders
that sometime soon
this district is to have a
little unofficial demonstration.
What?
A pogrom
here?
No, -no, -no, -no, -no. Just a
little unofficial demonstration.
Little?
- How little?
- Not too serious.
Just mischief so that if
an inspector comes
he can see that we did our duty.
Personally, I don't know why there
has to be trouble between people.
But I thought I should tell you.
Thank you, Your Honor.
You're a good man.
If I may say so
it's too bad you're not a Jew.
That's what I like about you.
You're always joking.
Congratulations again for your daughter.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Oh, about the other matter,
it won't be too bad.
- I wouldn't worry.
- Of course not.
Dear God
did you have to send me news like that
today of all days?
I know, we are the chosen people
but once in a while, can't
you choose someone else?
Anyway
thank you for sending a husband
for my Tzeitel.
Le'cheiim.
Now, after Jacob had worked
for Laban for seven years
do you know what happened?
Laban fooled him and gave
him his ugly daughter Leah.
So to marry Rachel, Jacob was
forced to work another seven years.
So you see, children
the Bible clearly teaches us
you can never trust an employer.
And that is what the Bible teaches us?
That is the lesson of the story of Jacob
if you interpret it correctly.
- Is your papa up yet?
- No, Mama.
Enough lessons. Back to the house.
There's work to be done.
Go on, children. Another story tomorrow.
That was a very interesting
lesson, Perchik.
- Do you think so?
- Mmm.
Although I don't know if the rabbi
would agree with your interpretation.
Neither, I suppose, would the rabbi's son.
My little sisters talk too much.
What do you know about him,
except that he is a rabbi's son?
At least I know this.
He has no strange ideas
about turning the world upside-down.
Good day, Perchik.
- You have wit, even intelligence.
- Thank you.
Perhaps. But what good is your brain?
Without curiosity, it is a rusty tool.
- Good day, Hodel.
- We have an old custom here!
A boy talks respectfully to a girl.
But of course that is too traditional for
an advanced thinker like you.
Our traditions! Nothing must change.
Everything is perfect
exactly the way it is!
- We like our ways.
- Our ways are changing all over but here.
Do you know that in the city, boys
and girls can be affectionate
without the permission of a matchmaker?
They hold hands together.
They even dance together!
New dances, like this.
I learned it in Kiev.
- Do you like it?
- It's very nice.
There.
We've just changed an old custom.
Yes.
I mean, th thank you.
I mean
good day!
Go away!
Mmm.
Ooh!
So, my prince is finally out of bed.
- Not now.
- Open your eyes.
- Go away.
- The day's half gone.
Well?
Well, what happened last night besides
your drinking like a peasant?
Did you see Lazar Wolf?
Well?
Well?!
Well, what did he say? What did you say?
Where
Where Where's Tzeitel?
She's in the barn. Do you have news for me?
Did you talk with Lazar Wolf?
Well, what happened?
Woman, patience.
As the Good Book says,
good news will stay
and bad news will refuse to leave.
- And there's another saying
- You can die from such a man!
Did you see Lazar? Was it friendly?
- Sha, woman!
- Are you still drunk, or what?
Ah! Here she is.
Tzeitel, my lamb, come here.
You are to be congratulated.
You are going to be married.
Married?
What do you mean, Papa?
Lazar Wolf has asked for your hand.
I knew it!
- The butcher?
- Oh dear God, I thank thee.
- I thank thee!
- Why do you have to
What do you have to say, Tzeitel?
- What can she say?
- Let her say one word.
My firstborn, a bride.
May you grow old with him
in fortune and honor.
Not like Fruma Sarah, that
first wife of Lazar's.
She was a bitter woman. (Tup'-tup')
May she rest in peace.
Not like my Tzeitel.
And now I must thank Yente.
My Tzeitel, a bride. A bride!
I thank thee, I thank thee!
Well, Chaveleh?
Mazel tov, Tzeitel.
"Mazel tov, Tzeitel."
What kind of a mazel tov is that?
You, Reb Perchik, aren't you
going to congratulate her?
Congratulations, Tzeitel
for getting a rich man.
Aah!
Again with the rich. What's
wrong with being rich?
It's no reason to marry.
Money's the world's curse.
May the Lord smite me with it
and may I never recover!
"The world's curse."
My Tzeitel knows I mean only her welfare.
Am I right, Tzeitel?
- Yes, Papa.
- There, you see?
I see. I see very well.
Well, my child
why are you so silent?
Aren't you happy with
this blessing, huh?
Papa
Papa.
What is it? Tell me.
Papa, I don't want to marry him.
I can't marry him, I can't.
What do you mean you can't?
If I say you will, you will.
Papa, if it's a matter of
money, I'll do anything.
I'll work as a servant.
- Just don't
- But we made an agreement!
And with us, an agreement is an agreement.
Is that
more important than I am, Papa?
Papa, don't force me, please!
I'll be unhappy all my days!
- I don't want to marry him.
- All right.
All right.
I won't force you.
Oh, thank you, Papa.
"Thank you, Papa."
It seems it was not ordained
that you should have all
the comforts of life.
- Reb Tevye, may I speak to you?
- Later, Motel. Later.
- But I would like to speak to you.
- Not now, Motel. Not now.
I have problems.
That's why I want to speak to you.
I think I can help.
Sertanly, like a bandage can help a corpse.
Good-bye, Motel. Good-bye.
At least listen to him, Papa.
All right. You have a tongue. Talk.
Reb Tevye, I-I hear you are
arranging a match for Tzeitel.
Ah, he also has ears.
Well,
- I have a match for Tzeitel.
- What kind of a match?
A perfect fit.
Like a glove.
This match was made exactly to measure.
Perfect fit? Made to measure?
Motel, stop talking like a
tailor and tell me, who is it?
Please don't shout at me, Reb Tevye.
All right, I won't shout.
Who is it?
Who is it?
Who is it?
Who is it?!?
WHO IS IT!?!
It's me.
Myself.
It's him. Himself.
Either you're out of your
mind or you're crazy!
He must be crazy! Arranging
a match for yourself?
Tell me what are you everything?
The bridegroom, the matchmaker,
the guests all rolled into one?
I suppose you'll even perform
the ceremony yourself!
Please don't shout at me, Reb Tevye.
Now as for being my matchmaker,
I know it's unusual.
Unusual? It's crazy!
Times are changing, Reb Tevye.
The thing is, over a year ago, your daughter,
Tzeitel and I gave each other our pledge
that we would marry.
You gave each other a pledge?
Yes, Papa.
We gave each other our pledge.

or doesn't anyone have to

I've wanted to ask you
for some time Reb Tevye.
But first, I wanted to save enough
for my own sewing machine
You stop talking nonsense.
You are just a poor tailor!
That's true, Reb Tevye but even a poor
tailor is entitled to some happiness!
I promise you, Reb Tevye, your
daughter will not starve.
Hmm?
He's beginning to talk like a man.
On the other hand
what kind of a match would that be
with a poor tailor?
On the other hand, he is
an honest, hard worker.
But on the other hand
he has absolutely nothing.
On the other hand, things could
never get worse for him.
They could only get better.
They gave each other a pledge.
Unheard of,

Hello, Sarah.
- Mazel tov, Chava, mazel tov!
- Thank you.
- Soon it will be you.
- I hope so.
- Give my best wishes to Tzeitel.
- I will.
- Mazel tov, mazel tov!
- Bye.
Mazel tov, Chava!

Mazel tov
No, don't Please please.
I just want to pass.
All right, stop it.
What's wrong with you, Fyedka?
- Just stop it.
- We're just having a little fun.
Good-bye, Sasha.
I said good-bye.
I'm sorry about that. They mean no harm.
Don't they?
Is there something you want?
Yes. I'd like to talk to you.
I'd rather not.
I've often noticed you at the bookseller's.
Not many girls in this
village like to read.
Would you like to
to borrow this book?
It's very good.
No,
Thank you.
Why?
Because I'm not Jewish?
Do you feel about me
the way they feel about you?
I didn't think you would.
And what do you know about me, eh?
Let me tell you about myself.
I'm a pleasant fellow. Charming
honest, ambitious, quite bright
and very modest.
Go ahead. Take the book
and after you return it
I'll ask you how you like it
and we can talk about it for a while.
Then we can talk about life
how we feel about things.
Here.
Thank you.
Good day, Chava.
Good day.
Fyedka!
Fyedka.
YeAAhh!

Will you wake up! Shh!
- Where is she?
- Where-where? Who?
- Where is who? What are you talking about?
- Where is she?
Fruma Sarah. Fruma Sarah,
Lazar Wolf's first wife.
She was standing here a minute ago.
- Where is she?
- What are you talking about?
Fruma Sarah's has been
dead for years. Sha!
- Yes, yes.
- You must have been dreaming.
- Sha.
- Yes.
Now
tell me what you dreamt
- and I'll tell you what it meant.
- Ooo
- It was terrible.
- Tell me.
All right
only don't be Frightened!
In the beginning
I dreamt that er
we were having
a celebration of some kind.
Everybody we knew
all of our beloved departed
were there.
All of them
even your Great Uncle
Mordechai was there
And er and your cousin Rachel was there.
And in the middle of the dream
in walks your grandmother
Tzeitel, may she rest in peace.
Grandmother Tzeitel! How did she look?
Well, for a woman who's dead 30 years
she looked very good.
Naturally, I went up to greet her.

And to think it was brought on
because you went to see that butcher.
Tevye
Tevye My grandmother Tzeitel,
may she rest in peace(Tup'-Tup')
took the trouble to come all the way
from the other world
to tell us about the tailor.
All I can say is that
it's for the best
and couldn't possibly be any better.
- But, Golde
- Amen.
Amen.
Cu-cu-cooo!
Do you like these troublemakers?
- These Christ killers?
- Of course not.
I just meant that things
have been peaceful here.
I have other villages to visit.
If you don't want to follow orders,
we shall get someone else who will.
Oh, no, no, no. No, sir.
I'll take care of it, of course.

Mazel tov!
Quiet down! Quiet down!
Quiet down!
That was really beautiful.
Take your places, everybody.
Quiet! Quiet down!
Quiet down!
Quiet down!
Haa!
The newlyweds.
Friends
we are gathered here to
share in the joys
of the newlyweds, Motel and Tzeitel.
May they live together
to a ripe old age. Amen!
And now I want to say
Reb Nachum!
Please! Not here!
Now I'd like to announce
that the bride's parents
are giving the newlyweds the following:
A new feather bed
two pillows
Goose pillows.
A Sabbath tablecloth
and a pair of candlesticks.
Quiet!
Now, we are just here on
earth for a short visit.
Even the great and wealthy must die.
In fact, if the rich could
hire others to die for them
we, the poor, would all make a nice living.
Well put! Well put!
Lazar Wolf. Talking about the rich.
There sits our good friend Lazar Wolf.
Lazar has everything in the world
except a bride.
But Lazar has no ill feelings.
In fact, he has a gift for the newlyweds
that he himself wants to announce.
Come on, Lazar. Come on!
Just like he said
I have no ill feelings.
What's done is done.
I am giving the newlyweds five chickens
one for each of the first five Sabbaths
their er wedded life.
Reb Lazar Wolf, you are a decent man
and on behalf of my daughter
and her new husband
I accept your gift.
- There is a famous saying that
- Reb Tevye,
I am not marrying your daughter.
I don't have to listen to your sayings.
- Why if you would only listen for one
moment - Why should I listen to you?
A man who breaks an agreement
I have a right to talk!
What right? It's not your wedding.
It should have been!
But it's not, thank goodness.
- Don't shame Tevye
- He shamed me
in front of the whole village.
He shamed me!
Shaaa!
Rabbi, say something.
I say
Yeah.
I say let's sit down.
Yes. Well, we all heard
the words of the rabbi.
Let's sit down.
Now I'm going to sing a little song.
Mmm.
<i>♪ Dai-dai dai deedle deedle dai-dai ♪</i>
<i>♪ Dai-dai dai ♪</i>
I don't want that. Leave me alone.
<i>♪ Dai-dai dai deedle deedle dai-dai ♪</i>
You can keep your diseased chickens!
You leave my chickens out of this!
- We made a bargain!
- The terms weren't settled!
We drank on it!
Just sit down, all right?
Once a butcher, always a butcher.
- Once a liar, always a liar.
- You just sit down, all right?
Those happen to be my chickens. That man
I had a sign!
Quiet, I'm singing.
♪ Dai-dai dai ♪
Quiet, quiet!
What's all the screaming about?
"They drank on it." "An agreement."
"A sign." It's all nonsense.
Tzeitel wanted to marry
Motel and not Lazar.
A young girl decides for herself?
Why not? They love each other.
- Love?
- Terrible.
- He's a radical.
- Musicians, play.
It's a dance. Everybody dance.
- It's a wedding!
- Some wedding.
- What is he doing?
- Perchik!
Who will dance with me?
- That's a sin.
- It's no sin to dance at a wedding.
- But with a girl?
- Yes, with a girl!
That's what comes of taking
a wild man into your house.
He's not a wild man!
His ideas are a little bit different, but
Perchik
- Come on.
- It's a sin.
It's no sin. Ask the rabbi.
Go on, ask him.
Well, rabbi?
Dancing?
- It's not exactly forbidden, but
- Well, there you see!
- It's not forbidden!
- And it's no sin.
Now, who will dance with me?
He's asking her to dance!
Hodel!
It's only a dance, Mama.
Play!
Say something.
She's dancing with a man!
I can see that she's dancing with a man!
And I'm going to dance with my wife!
Mama, no!
Golde.
GOLDE!
- No, I will not.
- Tzeitel!
Motel.
See that? You are responsible for that
and I can't stand it!
I tried my best!
Everybody dance!
Come on! Dance, rabbi, dance!
Hay!
Yeahh!
Perchik!
All right! Enough!
I said enough! Come!
Orders are orders, you understand?
Well
why are you all standing around?
Clean up!

Troubles, troubles.
That's all you hear from me, right?
But who else can we simple people
take our troubles to?
You know, sometimes I wonder.
Who do you take your troubles to?
Uhh! Go away.
Anyway, Motel and Tzeitel have
been married for some time now.
They work very hard.
And they're as poor
as squirrels in winter.
But they're so happy they don't
know how miserable they are.
Motel keeps talking about a sewing machine.
I know. You are very busy now.
Wars, revolutions, floods, plagues
all those little things that
bring people back to you.
But couldn't you take a second
and get him his sewing machine?
Yeah, and while you are
in the neighbourhood
as you can see, my horse's leg is
Am I bothering you too much?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
As the Good Book says
Why should I tell you
what the Good Book says?
So you must go away?
Yes.
So soon?
Yes.
Tomorrow morning.
- A-a-alone?
- No. With a few friends.
And of course we'll be joining others.
- Where?
- In the city Kiev.
Hodel, there are some things
I cannot tell even you.
I see.
Please don't be upset.
Why should I be upset? If
you must leave, you must.
I do have to.
So you've told me.
Great changes are about to
take place in this country.
Tremendous changes.
But they can't happen by themselves.
So naturly you feel that you personally
Not only me! Many people!
Jews, Gentiles many people hate what's
going on. Don't you understand?
I understand, of course.
You want to leave.
Then good-bye.
Hodel, listen to me!
I have work to do.
The greatest work a man can do.
Don't you understand?
Yes, Perchik.
Hodel!
Hodel!
Hodel, wait!
Hodel, there's a question
A certain question I-I
wish to discuss with you.
- Yes?
- It's a political question.
- What is it?
- The question of marriage.
Is this a political question?
Well, yes.
Yes, everything's political.
Like everything else, the relationship
between a man and a woman
has a socioeconomic base.
Marriage must be founded on mutual beliefs.
A common attitude and
philosophy towards society.
And affection?
Well, yes. Of course.
Th-That is also necessary.
Such a relationship can have
positive social values.
When two people face the world
with unity and solidarity
And affection!
Yes, that is an important element!
At any rate, I
I personally am in favor of such
a socioeconomic relationship.
I think
you're asking me to marry you.
Well a'
in a theoretical sense.
Yes, I am.
I was hoping you were.
I'm very happy, Hodel.
I'm very, very happy.
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, Reb Tevye.
I have some bad news.
- What?
- I must leave here.
- When?
- Tomorrow morning.
I'm sorry to hear that.
- We'll all miss you.
- But I also have some good news.
- Good.
- You can congratulate me.
- Congratulations. What for?
- We are engaged.
- Engaged?
- Yes, Papa. We're engaged.
No, you're not.
I know. You like him, and he likes you.
But you're going away,
and you're staying here.
So have a nice trip. I
hope you'll be happy.
- And my answer is no!
- Please, Papa. You don't understand.
I understand.
I gave permission to Motel and Tzeitel,
so you feel you also have a right.
I'm sorry. I like you.
But you're going away.
So go in good health.
- And my answer is still no!
- You don't understand.
And you are not listening. I said no!
Reb Tevye, we're not asking
for your permission.
Only for your blessing.
We are going to get married.
Well,
you are not asking for my permission?
But we would like your blessing, Papa.

for her and marry her.
I love her.
He loves her.

It's a new style.

- Good day to you, Esther.
She didn't like her. Just a minute.
Tzeitel, Tzeitel!
- Good day, Yente.
- Tzeitel!
I happened to stop in the post office
today to say hello see what's what.
It doesn't cost anything to be friendly.
Ah, so few people are like that.
People, huh! I tell you,
Tzeitel, if God lived on earth,
people would break his windows.
- So you went to the post office?
- Yes, and the postman told me
there was a letter there
for your sister Hodel.
- Thanks. I'll go get it.
- I got it.
It's from her intended, Perchik.
Hodel will be so happy. She's been
waiting to hear from him for

- So it happened to be opened.
You don't have to wait
for the train, Papa.
You'll be late for your customers.
It's all right.
They'll just have to wait for a while.
Is he in bad trouble
that hero of yours?
Arrested?
- Convicted?
- Yes. But he did nothing wrong.
He cares nothing for himself.
Everything he does is for other people.
Yes, but if he did nothing wrong,
he wouldn't be in trouble.
Oh, Papa. How can you say that?
What wrongs did Joseph do?
And Abraham? And Moses?
And they had troubles.
Yes, but.
But why won't you tell me
where he is now, this Joseph of yours?
It is far, Papa.
Terribly far.
He is in a settlement in Siberia.
Siberia?
And he asks you to leave
your father and mother
and join him in that frozen wasteland
and marry him there?
No, Papa.
He did not ask me to go.
I want to go.
I don't want him to be alone.
I want to help him in his work.

We will be married under a canopy.
Yes.
No doubt, a rabbi or two
were also arrested.
Papa!
God alone knows when we
shall see each other again.
Then we will leave it in his hands.
Take care of her.
See that she dresses warm.
Even though she only burned his cooking
he's permitted to divorce her!
- Just for supper?
- That's what it says.
- I'm sorry, Rabbi
- Yes, of course.
What news of the outside world, Avram?
- Oh, it's terrible Rabbi, terrible!
- Then don't tell me!
If I want bad news, I'll read
about Noah and the flood.
Tell me, Avram.
Surely somewhere there are
good things happening?
Can't you buy a paper
that prints those things?
It's not my fault,
Rabbi, I only read it.
- Rabbi! Rabbi! Did you hear the news?
- More bad news?
No! Good news! At Motel and Tzeitel's!
A new arrival!

Ah, thank you, thank
you very much.
- It's a nice thing.
- Yes, it is.
- Very nice.
- Thank you.
- What is it?
- It's a sewing machine!
It can work twice as fast.
You got it!
I got it!
- It's beautiful.
- I know.
- Have you tried it yet?
- Look!
- Beautiful!
- I know!
And in less than a minute! See how
close and even the stitches are?
- It's beautiful!

From now on my clothes will be perfect!
Made by machine! No
more handmade clothes!
Look, Mama! Look.
Oooh!
It's wonderful!

Rabbi, is there a blessing
for a sewing machine?
There is a blessing for everything.

Amen.
That's your new arrival?
What is it, a boy or a girl?
Well put, well put.
Yankela. Yankela!
Aaah!
Why Why isn't he asleep?
Oh, Mama. But he's wonderful!
He never cries or any
Sha! Do you want to invite bad luck?
Aaah!
Ohh, well. Well, Motel.
I never thought you'd amount to anything.
But look at you! A baby,
a new sewing machine.
You're a person.
- I'll show you how it works.
- Go, children!
First you put the cloth in, like this.
It's an amazing thing. You work
it with your foot and your hand.
Your father is coming.
Chava, let me talk to him.
Let me tell him about us.
No, Fyedka. That would be the worst thing.
- But let me try!
- No!
I'll talk to him. I promise.
Good afternoon, sir.
Good afternoon.
It's It's a cold day, isn't it?
Mmm.
Well, er
Good day, sir.
- Good day, Chava.
- Good day.
What were you and he talking about?
Nothing. We were just talking.
Good.
Papa!
Fyedka and I We've known
each other for a long time now.
Chaveleh
I would be much happier
if you would remain
friends from a distance.
You must not forget who you are
and who that man is.
- He has a name, Papa.
- Of course.
All creatures on Earth have a name.
Fyedka's not a creature, Papa.
- Fyedka is a man!
- Who says he isn't?
It's just that he's a
different kind of man.
As the Good Book says
"Each shall seek his own kind."
In other words, a bird may love a fish
but where would they build a home together?
- The world is changing, Papa!
- No, Chaveleh.
No.
Some things do not change for us.
Some things will never change.
We don't feel that way.
"We"?
Fyedka and I. We
want to be married.
What? Are you out of your mind?
What?
Don't you understand what that means,
marrying outside of the faith?
- But, Papa!
- No!
I said no!
Never talk about it again.
Never mention his name again.
Never see him again.
Never
Do you understand me?
Yes, Papa.
I understand you.
You're finally here. Let's go
home, it's late for supper.
I want to see Motel's new machine.
You'll see it another
time, it's getting late.
Quiet, woman, before I get angry!
Because when I'm angry, even
flies don't dare to fly!
I'm very frightened of you. After
we finish supper I'll faint.
Golde!
I am the man in the house!
I'm the head of the family!
And I Want To See Motel's New Machine Now!
Now let's go home!
What are you doing here? What do you want?
May I see His Honor the Priest?
- The Reverend Father?
- Yes.
Why do you want to see him?
It's a family matter.
A personal matter.
- My daughter.
- Yes? What about your daughter?
Please, if I could speak with the pr
If I could speak with the Reverend Father.
Please!
Wait here.
Tevye!
Tevye!
What is it?
It's Chava.
She left home this morning
with Fyedka.
What?
I've looked everywhere for her.
I even went to the priest.
He told me they were married.
Married?
Yes.
Well
go home, Golde.
We have other children at home.
You have work to do. I have work to do.
- Go home.
- But Chaveleh!
Chava is dead to us!
We'll forget her.
Go home.

How can I accept them?
Can I deny everything I believe in?
On the other hand
can I deny my own daughter?

Wonderful boys, Golde.
From good families! Each
of them a prize, a jewel!
You couldn't do better for your girls.
I don't know, Yente. MyMy
girls are still so young.
So what do they look like? Grandfathers?
True, the marriage can wait.
But meanwhile their future
will be all signed and sealed!
Which one for which one?
What's the difference? Take your pick.
They're both wonderful boys!
Yankel, the fat one, is
apprenticed to a carpenter.
- I'm Yankel.
- Did I ask you?
- Yankel, the skinny one, is
- Mama, is Reb Tevye in the house?
He's in the barn. Is there trouble?
Stay inside, children.
What is it? What's the matter?
Tevye! Tevye! Have you
seen the Constable lately?
- No. Why?
- There's some rumors in town.
We thought since you knew him so well
maybe he told you what
is true and what is not.
Rumors? What rumors?
Quiet! Talk, Avram.
Someone from Zolodin said an edict
was issued in St. Petersburg that
Welcome, Your Honor.
- What's the good news in the world?
- I see that you have company.
They are my friends.
It's just as well.
What I have to say is for their ears also.
How much time do you need to sell
your house and household goods?
Why should I sell my house?
Is it in anybody's way?
I came to tell you you
have to leave Anatevka.
And how did I come to
deserve such an honor?
Not just you. But all of you.
What? What do you mean?
Stop it! Stop it!
At first I thought you
might be spared Tevye,
because of the marriage
of your daughter.
My daughter is dead.
I understand.
At any rate, it affects all of you.
You all have to leave.
But But this corner of the world
has always been our home.
Why should we leave?
I don't know why. There's trouble
in the world! Troublemakers!
- Like us?
- You aren't the only ones.
Your people must leave all the
villages: Zolodin, Rabalevka
The entire district must be emptied!
I have an order here!
It says that you must sell your homes
and be out of here in three days.
It says in three days!
It's impossible!
The children!
And you!
You who have known us all your life
you'd carry out this order?
I've nothing to do with it!
Don't you understand?
I wish you wouldn't say "me"!
I understand.
Suppose we refuse to go?
You will be forced out!
- We will defend ourselves.
- We'll stay in our homes.
- We won't move!
- We'll keep our land!
- Fight!
- Against our militia? Our army?
- I wouldn't advise that!
- I have some advice for you.
Get off my land.
This is still my home
my land.
Get off my land.
You have three days!
After a lifetime,
a piece of paper, and get thee out.
Let's get together with
the people of Zolodin.
- Maybe they have a plan.
- We should defend ourselves!
An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth!
Very good. That way the whole world
will be blind and toothless.
Rabbi
we've been waiting for the
Messiah all our lives.
Wouldn't this be a good
time for him to come?
We'll have to wait for him someplace else.
Meanwhile, let's start packing.
Well, Anatevka hasn't exactly
been the Garden of Eden.
That's true.
After all, what have we got here?
<i>♪ A little bit of this. ♪</i>
<i>♪ A little bit of that. ♪</i>
- A pot.
- A pan.
- A broom.
- A hat.
Someone should have set a match
to this place years ago.
- A bench.
- A tree.
- What's a house.
- Or a stove.
People who pass through Anatevka
don't even know they've been here.
A stick of wood.
A piece of cloth.

It's just a place.
Our forefathers have been forced out of
many many places at a moment's notice.
Maybe that's why
we always wear our hats.
Golde!
Golde, darling!
I had to see you before I left.
Because I have such news for you.
You remember, Golde, yesterday I
told you I didn't know where to go,
what do to with these old bones?
Now I know. You wanna hear? I'll tell you.
All my life I've dreamed
of going to one place.
Guess where? Nah,
you'll never guess.
Every year at Passover, what do we say?
"Next year in Jerusalem."
"Next year in the Holy Land."
You're going to the Holy Land!
You guessed.
Good-bye, Yente.
Be well
and go in peace.
Yeah. And so, goodbye, Golde.
And sometime maybe we'll
meet on a happier occasion.
Meanwhile, we suffer.
Oh-ho-hoh, we suffer.
We suffer in silence. Right?
Of course, right.
Where are you going?
You don't know where you're going?
Come, Golde. We have to leave.
Leave. It sounds so easy.
Golde, we'll all be together soon.
Motel, Tzeitel and the baby
they'll come too.
You'll see. This Motel is a person.
And Hodel and Perchik? When
will we ever see them again?
Do they visit us from
Siberia every Sabbath?
You know what she writes.
He sits in prison. She works.
But soon he'll be set free.
And together they'll turn
the world upside-down.
She couldn't be happier.
And the other children will be with us.
Not all.
All!
Come, Golde.
I have to clean up. Sweep the floor.
Sweep the floor?
I don't want to leave a dirty house!
Tevye!
Tevye,
I'm on my way.
Where are you going?
Chicago, in America.
Chicago, America?
We are going to New York, America.
We'll be neighbors.
My wife, Fruma Sarah, may she rest
in peace, has a brother there.
- That's nice.
- I hate him!
But
a relative is a relative.
- Goodbye, Tevye.
- Good-bye, Lazar Wolf.
Well, my old friends. It's
time to say good-bye.
The farmer Busenko will
be coming for you later.
He's not a bad sort.
If you are good to him,
he'll be good to you.
Take care of your leg, huh?
Thanks for everything.
Chava!
- Papa will see you.
- I want him to.
I want to say good-bye to him.
- He won't listen to you.
- But at least he will hear.
Maybe it would be better if I told Mama.
Chaveleh!
Papa?
Papa,
We came to say good-bye.
We're also leaving this place.
We're going to Krakow.
We cannot stay among people
who do such things to others.
We wanted you to know that.
Some are driven away by edicts
others, by silence.
Good-bye, Papa.
Mama.
Come, Chava.
Good-bye, Chava, Fyedka!
And God be with you.
And God be with you.
We will write to you in
America if you like.
We will be staying with Uncle Avram!
Yes, Mama!
"We'll be staying with Uncle Avram"!
"We'll be staying with Uncle Avram?"
The whole world has to know our business!
Stop yelling, and finish packing!
We have a long way to go!
Golde, I don't need your advice!
Tzeitel, don't forget the baby!
Good-bye, Papa.
Work hard, Motel.
And come to us soon.
I will, Papa.
I'll work hard.
All right, children
let's go.
