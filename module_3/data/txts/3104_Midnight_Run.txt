[shotgun blast]
Shit!
[gunshot]
[gunshot]
[brakes screeching]
Crazy-drivin' motherfucker.
- Shit.
- Come on.
Hey! Hey, Marvin,
what are you doin'?
- He's mine, Jack. Get lost.
- Fuck you he's yours, he's mine.
Eddie assigned this guy to me.
What the hell are you doing'?
Well then go
straighten it out with Eddie.
I'll collect the money.
I almost got killed
tryin' to get this guy.
- He shot at me--
- Back off, goddamn it!
I said I'm takin' him, all right?
- All right, Marvin.
- This guy's worth $1,200!
Okay, okay Marvin.
What the hell are we fightin' for?
We're friends- -
Nothin' personal, Jack,
but fuck off, all right?
Take it easy. Jesus!
Marvin, watch out!
What the fuck's goin' on?
You guys ain't cops.
No, we're ballet dancers.
Didn't your mother ever teach you
how to react to strangers?
Not shoot at them? Huh?
Hey, Marvin, thanks for the car.
You sleep,
and I'll bring it back a little later.
[engine starts]
Got a delivery for you, Gooch.
Jack. The soda machine's been out
for a week and a half.
Check that for me, would ya?
What do we got here?
Alright.
- Give you any trouble?
- Did you give me any trouble?
- Fuck you, man!
- He didn't give me any trouble.
Fuck you, too, man!
- Move!
- I know my motherfuckin' rights!
Slap it.
Moscone's Bail Bonds.
No, it's cash only.
No checks, no cards.
I'm sorry, ma'am. That's the policy.
I wish I could help you out. Sorry.
Just dropped off Bouchet. Is Eddie in?
So you finally caught someone, Jack.
Jerry, is he in?
I think that's terrific.
Jack, I been tryin' to reach
you since last night.
What do you got for me?
Been tryin' to reach me? It's Bouchet.
Ooh, Bouchet. Good score, Jack.
$900, right?
No, it's $1,200.
- No, $900.
- That's, that's $1,200. Come on.
No. Yeah, you're right.
My stomach's killin' me.
<i>I'm gain' over
to Chin Leo's for breakfast.</i>
- I want to talk to you.
- About what?
- I'll talk to you over there.
- Could I have my money first?
Of course.
What, do you think
I'm gonna try and stiff you?
You? Never!
He would never try and stiff me.
Do I detect some kind of sarcasm here?
Never.
Where have
I inherited this reputation?
I have never done business
with anybody,
and Jerry is my witness...
...that I have ever, ever, ever...
Has that phone ever rang...
Has that phone ever rang
with a complaint about me?
Never, never. So let's go.
I'll buy you some breakfast.
I don't eat breakfast.
Well then, have an early lunch.
Let's go.
You ever hear of a guy
named Jonathan Mardukas?
- The Duke. Yeah, I know who he is.
- What do you know?
He's that accountant that
embezzled a couple of million
from some Vegas wise guy
and he gave it to charity.
That's very good.
Only thing is, that it wasn't a couple
of million. It was $15 million.
It wasn't some Vegas wise guy.
It was Jimmy Serrano.
I know, I know.
I can read the papers.
Look, I don't want to
bring up the past, but...
...isn't Serrano the guy
that ran you
out of Chicago when he
was runnin' things back there?
He didn't run me out.
Yeah, right right right. You gave
up bein' a cop to do this shit?
- Alright, what's the point?
- The point, Jack:
I bailed out the accountant.
I didn't know who he was at the time.
I mean, had I known there was
no way I would've put up the bond.
I mean it's only a matter of time
before Serrano vanishes
this guy from the planet
and I'm out $450,000.
You're out $450,000 on this guy?
- No.
- No.
No, because I got you,
and you're the best,
and you're gonna find him
and bring him back.
Yeah, right.
How do you even know
this guy is still alive?
Because this guy is crazy.
He sends postcards to Serrano.
He's tellin' him what a great time
he's havin' with his money.
How much time you got left?
Friday, midnight, I default.
I eat the $450,000.
This Friday? That's five days.
Forget it. You go find him,
give me my money.
Jack, alright, look.
Listen to me.
I'll give you $40...
I'll give you $50,000.
$50,000? I gotta chase you down
for $1,200. Forget about it.
- No, no, no, no, Jack, please.
- Jack, nothing, forget about it. What else you got?
I ain't got nothin', this is it.
If you don't find this guy,
I'm out of business.
Eddie...
I'll do it for $100,000.
$100,000? Are you out of your mind?
This is an easy gig.
It's a midnight run for Chrissakes.
Maybe you haven't noticed,
but I'm tired of gettin' shot at.
I'm tired of this
miserable fuckin' business,
every lowlife that I run into.
If you're gonna pay me,
you gotta pay me what's right.
You want me for this job,
give me what's right.
First of all,
the guy is an accountant.
He's not gonna shoot you.
All you have to do is find him.
You put him in a bag,
hit him with a rubber hose,
bring him home.
That's easy for you to say,
listen to me,
it's $100,000, no more, no less,
and I want a contract.
- Contract?
- That's right, I want it in writing.
$100,000, and I'll have the Duke
here for you by Friday night.
Now, can I have my $1,200, please?
Man, you do worse than any crook
I ever put a bond up for.
Stanley?
Stan.
Hey, Big Dog. How are you?
What are you doin' here?
Listen, I need a favor.
I need to see the booking slip
of a Jonathan Mardukas.
M-A-R-D-U-K-A-S.
There you go.
- Yes, sir.
- What's that?
The number he called
right after he was arrested.
212 area code.
Looks like I'm goin' to New York.
Are you Jack Walsh?
- Excuse me.
- Are you Jack Walsh?
- I'm sorry, do I know you?
- Alonzo Mosely, FBI.
That's a nice badge.
How can I get one of those?
I want to talk to you, Jack.
Yeah? Why don't you
call my social secretary?
Yeah, very funny.
I want to talk to you.
Take your hands off me!
Jeez.
Take it easy!
You know it's a $10 fine
for jaywalking in Los Angeles?
Shut up.
What I want to know is
are you working on anything
having to do with Jonathan Mardukas?
Never heard of him.
Well, I believe you have heard of him.
Let me tell you something, asshole.
We've been working on
this Jimmy Serrano thing
for about six years.
Mardukas is my shot.
I'm gonna bring him into federal court
and I don't want any
third rate rent-a-thug
who couldn't cut it
as a cop in Chicago
bringing him to LA
on some bullshit local charge.
Do I make myself understood?
Can I ask you something?
These sunglasses, they're really nice.
Are they government issued
or do all you guys go to, like,
the same store to get them?
Do I make myself understood?
Can't you take a joke?
Get him out of here.
No, let's talk some more.
Get the fuck out of here.
If I hear anything,
I'll let you know.
Good-bye. Have a nice day.
Think I could have my sunglasses back?
Here's your sunglasses.
[engine revs]
Thanks. Thanks for this, too.
"Alonzo Mosely."
Alonzo.
How's that?
Looks fine to me.
Harold Longman, please.
Harry? Jack Walsh.
How're you doin'?
You got that address check
on that phone number for me?
Uh-huh.
Okay, thanks a lot, Harry.
Say hello to Julie for me. Okay, bye.
Thank you.
You Jack Walsh?
- Who wants to know?
- That's a "Yes."
We'd really like to have
a word with you.
- Yeah? What about?
- It involves big cash, lot of prizes.
I'll make it short and sweet.
The people I work for are really
interested in your visit here.
Oh yeah? Who are the
people you work for?
An old friend of yours
from the Chicago days.
You're here for the Duke.
You think he's in New York,
and we think you're right.
That's a nice jacket.
What is it, goatskin?
Come on, Joey, please. Will you?
Never mind him.
The way I hear it,
you didn't cooperate
with my boss a few years back.
Is that the way you heard it?
Yeah, but I got a
news flash for you, Jack.
He'd pay a hell of a lot more
for the Duke
than that putz bail bondsman
back in LA.
- Oh yeah? How much more?
- How about a one with six zeros?
Are you gonna propose?
- Propose?
- Propose.
'Cause if you're not,
quit starin' at me.
- Okay?
- Starin' at you?
- You're staring at me.
- Joey, back off, will you please? C'mon.
Mr. Walsh, your car's located
in space number 206.
You can catch our shuttle bus
just through these doors.
Thank you.
Here's my number, Jack.
Ask for Tony Darvo. That's me.
They'll put you through
to wherever I am.
And be good to
yourself this time. Okay?
Tell Jimmy I said hello.
[phone ringing]
- [Woman]: Hello?
- Hello? Mrs. Nelson?
<i>Yes</i> g
Alonzo Mosely,
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
- How are you this afternoon?
- I'm fine.
Let me get right to the
point if I may, Mrs. Nelson.
An agent in our Los Angeles office
discovered a detail
that was somehow overlooked until now.
It seems that when a
Jonathan Mardukas was arrested
you were the first person he called.
Is that correct, Mrs. Nelson?
- <i>Are you there, Mrs. Nelson?
- Yes.</i>
Needless to say, this is a
matter of great concern to us,
and if it would not
be too much trouble,
we would like you to come down
tomorrow morning to 26 Federal Plaza.
Do you think you could do that?
- I suppose so.
- About 9:00 a.m.?
- Yes.
- Just ask for Agent Alonzo Mosely.
Thanks for your cooperation.
Have a nice day.
[phone dialing]
[phone ringing]
<i>- Hello?
- Dana? it's Helen.</i>
<i>The FBI just called.</i>
<i>They want to speak to me
about Jonathan.</i>
<i>- Oh, my God! Helen.
- [Jonathan]: Helen, what's going on?</i>
<i>[Helen]: Jonathan,
the FBI just called.</i>
<i>They know we spoke the night
you were arrested.</i>
<i>[Jonathan]: Hang up the phone, Helen.
Right now.</i>
[tape rewinding]
[phone dialing]
Aah, sweet music.
[car starting]
[muffled conversation]
[Go9 growls]
[barking]
[barking continues]
- What is it, Jon?
- I don't know.
Okay. Okay, Heidi. Okay.
Alonzo Mosely, FBI!
You're under arrest!
Get this fucking dog out of here!
Get the dog out of here, ma'am!
Not you. You stay there.
Get the dog, ma'am.
- Do it, do it.
- Get the dog!
Heidi. Come on, girl.
Come on, now.
Good girl.
Come on, come on.
Don't move or I'll shoot you
right through the glass.
Get over here.
Put your hands up against the wall.
Your hands up against the wall.
Spread your feet.
Relax. There won't be a problem.
Put your left hand behind your head.
Put your left... That's it.
You're taking me to the airport,
aren't you?
You don't look
like an FBI agent to me.
Yeah?
Well you don't look like a Duke to me.
If you're an FBI agent,
why don't you just take me
to the FBI office?
If you don't be quiet, this is going
to be the worst trip of your life.
You work for Jimmy Serrano,
don't you?
I don't work for that
piece of shit.
Your bail bondsman hired me
to bring you back to LA,
and that's what I'm doing.
- I got money, you know.
- I'm sure you do.
- I'll give you whatever you want.
- Start by shutting up.
I've known you all of two minutes,
and already I don't like you.
Gee, that's too bad.
I really like you.
I can't keep you cuffed
on a commercial flight.
I gotta check my gun with my luggage,
but you fuck with me once
and I'm gonna break your neck.
- I can't fly.
- What?
- You heard me. I can't fly.
- No, no. You're gonna have to do better than that, pal.
No, I don't have to do better than that,
because it's the truth. I can't fly.
- I suffer from aviophobia.
- What does that mean?
It means I can't fly. I also suffer
from acrophobia and claustrophobia.
Well, I'll tell you what.
If you don't cooperate,
you're gonna suffer
from "fistophobia."
[phone rings]
Moscone's Bail Bonds.
Jerry, put Eddie on the phone.
Jack, what's the progress?
- I got him.
- You got who?
The Duke. He's standing right here.
You got him? Already?
<i>Sure do. Want to say hello?</i>
Say hello to your bail bondsman,
Eddie Moscone.
Hello.
There you go.
Jonathan Mardukas in the flesh.
Jack, I love you!
<i>What happened? How did this happen?
Where'd you find him?</i>
<i>[Jack]: I found him in New York.
We're at the airport.</i>
<i>[Eddie]: Holy Christ,
this is wonderful!</i>
<i>This is wonderful news!</i>
<i>[Jack]: I'll be in your office
by midnight tonight</i>
<i>and I'm tellin' you right now, Eddie,</i>
<i>I don't want to hear any bullshit.
I want the money tonight.</i>
So go empty out
one of your Swiss bank accounts.
No, Jack, you don't have
to worry about nothin'.
This is the best money
I've ever spent.
<i>Okay. See you in a few hours.</i>
All right. I'll see you later.
'Night.
- So what's that all about?
- Jerry Walsh got the Duke!
- Walsh got the Duke?
- He got him! He got the Duke!
No kiddin'?
This calls for a celebration.
I'll get some donuts.
How do you think Walsh
found him so fast?
Yeah, hello.
Tony, this is Jerry.
- Jerry who?
- Jerry Geisler.
- What are you doing?
- Eating dinner. What do you want?
Look, I hate to bother you
but I thought you'd like to know
that Walsh found the Duke in New York.
<i>They're flyin' in tonight.
They should arrive around midnight.</i>
- Don't forget me, babe.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, kid, yeah.
Thanks. Good night.
Looks like your old friend
found the accountant.
They'll be flying into LA
around midnight.
Have them met at the airport.
- You understand?
- Done.
- Can I take your coat?
- That's fine. Thanks.
- May I take your coat?
- No.
First class is nice.
I could make a habit out of this.
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening to you.
Would either of you like a drink
before we take off?
Yes, we would like
one of your finest champagnes.
Certainly.
Let's see. Look at this.
Only in America. What a country. Huh?
Unbelievable.
I think I'm gonna have the steak.
How about you?
I'm not hungry.
Well why don't you
then get the lobster,
because then I can get a little
surf and turf action going.
I got a problem.
I can't fly.
I don't think
you're takin' me seriously.
- I'm takin' you very seriously.
- I can't be on this plane.
You think I haven't
heard your story before?
Who do you think you're
traveling with, a fucking novice?
Know what I'm talkin' about?
That's it. Settle in.
If you want to get up and talk
and be social and
mingle with the rest
of the passengers,
be my guest.
You ain't goin' nowhere.
There's a couple
of nice-lookin' people here.
Better class of people.
Your class.
Probably all embezzlers, too.
[singing]
Come fly with me, come fly away...
[engine starting]
Why don't you just try and relax?
Look, I...
Just calm down.
Just relax and calm down.
What are you
gettin' so excited about?
It's not--
No! I can't! I can't.
No, no, no!
I can't! I can't.
Just relax! What did I tell you?
- Now, don't pull that shit on me--
- No no no. I'm tellin' you, I can't do it.
No, I can't!
- These things go down!
- All right.
These things go down! It's too big!
It's too big! It can't go up!
[engines winding down]
All right, everyone. Just calm down.
- Alright, what's the problem?
- It's nothing, sir. It's okay.
Alonzo Mosely, FBI.
This man is in my custody.
I'm taking him
back to Los Angeles.
There won't be any more problems.
I don't want to fly.
I can't fly, really.
You can't take a prisoner aboard
an airplane if he doesn't want to fly.
You should know that.
I do. I'm sorry. I thought he was
bluffing. I thought he was bluffing.
I suggest you find some other mode
of transportation.
- What the fuck are you smilin' about?
- I love to travel by train.
Oh yeah? What do you think
this is, a class trip?
Are you always this angry?
Hey, look, right now
I'm in a great fucking mood.
You wait'll I'm cooped up
on that thing for a while
and you're not gonna be smilin'.
You're gonna be runnin'
for that fucking jail cell.
Still gonna make your schedule?
I'll make it, 14 hours to spare.
Oh, nice, nice. It's a double.
It's a double.
- There'll be a lot of room.
- Glad you like it.
Thanks, 'cause they're starting
to cut into my wrists. Thank you.
It just gets the skin after a while.
- Get in there.
- What do you want? What?
Oh, come on. Come on.
- Why would you do that?
- You enjoy yourself.
This is my room, and that's your room.
Good night.
- Hey, can I help you guys?
- Special Agent Mosely, FBI.
Mosely? Are all you guys named Mosely?
What the hell are you talking about?
You're here to pick up a prisoner,
right?
How did you know that?
He was afraid to fly,
so he got off the plane.
He left with an Agent Mosely.
Sir, that must mean that Walsh
has your identification.
[phone ringing]
Yeah?
Is this Moron Number 1?
Put Moron Number 2 on the phone.
Yeah, Jimmy.
He's, uh, right here. Hold on.
He's pissed.
Yeah?
I thought you told me this guy
was gonna be on the plane.
That's the information we got, Jimmy.
"That's the information we got."
I'm gonna tell you something,
I want this guy taken out,
and I want him taken out fast.
<i>You and that other dummy better start</i>
<i>getting more personally
involved in your work</i>
or I'm gonna stab you through the heart
with a fucking pencil, do you understand me?
You got it, Jimmy.
Tony.
He ain't mad at me, is he?
<i>[JOB]: Jack?</i>
<i>Jack, I think this is illegal.</i>
<i>Jack, I don't think you can
keep a person in a bathroom like this.</i>
- It's very claustrophobic in here--
- Yeah, it is?
Well, I'll tell you what. When we get to LA, you
can tell the prison psychiatrist all about it.
<i>There's no air.
There's no ventilation in here.</i>
<i>I told you I was claustrophobic.
Come on.</i>
<i>What do you think I'm gonna do?</i>
<i>Jump off a train
moving 90 miles an hour?</i>
<i>Jack?</i>
<i>Jack?</i>
<i>Jack?</i>
Good. Thanks. Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
- Good.
- Sit down.
Yeah, that's great. Very kind of you.
Nice, much better. Thank you. Good.
What are you doing?
What am I doin'?
- Arithmetic.
- Arithmetic?
Maybe I can help you.
I am an accountant.
Well, you know what?
I was thinkin', after I turn your
ass in and collect my money,
I'm gonna open up
a nice little coffee shop.
How much exactly are you getting
for me, may I ask?
I don't think that's any
of your concern,
but I'll tell you just to tell you.
- $100,000.
- $100,000?
Does that mean you'd take $100,000
to let me go?
Not by a long shot.
$200,000?
I never took a payoff in my life,
and I'm not gonna start
with someone like you.
- Why not?
- Because you're a fucking criminal,
and you deserve to go where you're goin',
and I'm gonna take you there.
If I hear any more shit out of you
I'm gonna fucking
bust your head and
I'm gonna put you back
in that fucking hole
and I'm gonna stick your head
in the fucking toilet bowl
and I'm gonna make it stay there.
I have to tell you,
a restaurant is a very
tricky investment.
More than half of them go under
within the first six months.
If I were your accountant,
I'd have to
strongly advise you against it.
You would, huh? Well,
you're not my accountant.
If I were your accountant--
I told you, I took you out here--
No, I'm just saying that
it's a very, very tricky business and
if I were your accountant,
I would really strongly have
to advise you against it,
as an accountant.
- You're not my accountant.
- I realize I'm not your accountant.
I'm just saying
if I were your accountant...
Jerry...
How the hell could he
miss the goddamn plane?
He called from the airport!
Alright, alright. It's time to bring in
Marvin, alright? Call him up. He's in Pittsburgh.
- Marvin Dorfler?
- Yeah, Dorfler.
Under "D" in the Rolodex
for "jerk," Jerry.
Can I at least have some french fries?
I said no, pecker breath. Now shut up.
[phone rings]
Yeah, Dorfler.
Marvin?
Sweetheart, am I glad I got you!
- Boy, do I have a job for you!
- Yeah? I'm listening.
First of all I gotta apologize,
because we were trying to find you
and it's a very important job,
but I couldn't find you.
So I had to give it to Walsh,
but now he's fucking it up...
I don't know why you
keep hiring that fucking guy.
<i>I know. I apologize. You are the best
at what you do. You know that? Now listen.</i>
Do you know who
Jonathan Mardukas is?
- No.
- Jonathan Mardukas, the Duke?
- Eddie, I never heard of him.
- Alright, listen. That's not important.
What's important is that you find him
and you bring him back. Okay?
Now, last I heard,
he had him in New York,
and now I don't know
where the hell they are.
<i>But if you find him,
I'll give you what I'm givin' Walsh.</i>
Yeah, what's that?
$25,000.
<i>But you gotta have him
back by Friday, midnight.</i>
<i>Otherwise the deal is off.</i>
Yeah, well, don't worry, Eddie. For $25,000,
I'll bring him in on a silver platter.
Bring him any way you want,
but bring him, okay?
Bye.
Hey, scumbag.
My name's Carmine, fucko.
Yeah, well, Carmine,
today's your lucky day.
- Why is today my “Icky da ,,
<i>'</i> Shut up! y'
Yeah, yeah, my name
is Jack Walsh.
Excuse me. John Wesley Walsh.
Yeah, I think I lost my credit card.
Can you tell me
the last place I used it?
Yeah, 731-483-9521-13.
The Amtrak office,
Grand Central Station?
Oh. Oh, yeah, yeah. I
remember that now.
Yeah, okay, yeah.
Thanks very much.
Hey, uh...
Maybe we ought to cancel that card, huh?
Yeah. Thank you.
Familiar with the word
"arteriosclerosis"?
"Cholesterol"?
If you want, I'll outline
a complete balanced diet for you.
Mail it to me from C-Block.
Why would you eat that?
Why? 'Cause it tastes good.
- But it's not good for you.
- I'm aware of that.
Why would you do something,
if you know it's not good for you?
Because I don't think about it.
That's living in denial.
- Living in denial?
- Yeah.
I'm aware of that.
So you're aware of all your behavior
yet you continue to do things
that aren't good for you.
That sounds sort of foolish.
Don't you think so, Jack?
No. Stealing $15 million
from Jimmy Serrano sounds foolish.
I didn't think I'd get caught.
Now, that's livin' in denial.
I'm aware of that.
So you're aware of your behavior
and yet you continue to do things
that aren't good for you.
Sounds kind of foolish to me,
don't you think, Jon?
It was foolish.
But taking $15 million in mob money
and giving it to charity
was good for a lot of people.
So you pissed off a Mafioso killer
just to be loved
by a bunch of fuckin' strangers.
That makes a lot of sense.
Don't you want to be loved?
Lots of people love me.
Really?
Who?
I got an ex-wife,
and I got a daughter in Chicago.
How do they put up
with all your sarcasm?
Beautifully. I haven't seen either
of them in nine years.
Think maybe we should go see them?
No, I don't think maybe
we should go see them.
Thanks for the interest, though.
The job must have been tough on them.
- I didn't do this then.
- What did you do?
- I was a cop.
- You were a cop in Chicago?
Then you must know
all about Jimmy Serrano.
Do you have the right
to ask these sort of questions?
- Yeah, I think I do.
- No, you don't.
- I think I do.
- No, you don't.
Why not?
Dinner's over. Let's go.
I can see this is gonna
be some fuckin' trip.
I wouldn't worry about it, Jack.
I'm not gonna be with you that much longer.
What do you mean?
With what I know about Serrano,
if I go to jail I'll be dead
within 24 hours,
so sooner or later,
I'm gonna have to give you the slip.
[chuckles]
Glad you find it humorous.
- Let's go.
- $2? That's all you're gonna leave?
- That's 15 percent.
- That's 13 percent.
These people depend
on tips for a living.
Can I help you, sir?
Yeah, yeah, I'm lookin' for this
buddy of mine, Jack Walsh.
He told me he'd meet me on this train.
Yeah, Mr. Walsh.
He's in Bedroom D, next car.
- That next car?
- Yes, sir. That way.
- Thanks.
- Sure thing. Have a good night.
One word and you're dead, asshole.
Shit! Son of a--
[grunts]
- How the fuck did you find out where I am?
- I ain't tellin' you shit!
Marvin, you'll force me to do something
I don't want to!
- What's going on here?
- Everything's under control.
Take it easy. Alonzo Mosely, FBI.
Radio ahead.
I want the local police
at the next stop to place
this man under arrest.
- What the fuck are you talkin' about?
- That's enough out of you!
Go ahead.
Get on the horn and call the cops.
Is this good news or bad news?
Apparently Mardukas and Walsh
are on the Amtrak
headed to Los Angeles.
Another bounty hunter was arrested
after he tried to take Mardukas away.
I want the jet ready in 20 minutes.
- Where's Jack Walsh?
- He got off with the other guy...
...two or three stops ago.
His real name's Mosely.
I'm Mosely!
I want to make a collect call
to Eddie Moscone from Jack Walsh.
- Moscone's Bail Bonds.
- Jerry, it's Jack. Put Eddie on.
- Jesus, Jack! Where the hell have you been?
- Jack, I want to talk to him.
Jack, where are you?
Where am I?
Eddie, I want to ask you something.
How come Dorfler wound up on my ass?
Did you put him on this,
you son of a bitch?
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Dorfler?
How could I put Dorfler on you?
- I don't even know where the fuck you are.
- You had nothin' to do with it?
Where are you?
You got the Duke or what?
- You're damn right I got him.
- Where are you?
<i>Where am I? I'm somewhere
between... I don't know. Toledo and Cleveland.</i>
- We're gettin' on a bus.
- Bingo.
Bus? What're you gonna do... Jack, don't get on a...
What, are you out of your mind?
Will you just shut up for a minute
and listen to me? We're gettin' on a bus.
<i>I just wanted to let you know
we're on our way, okay?</i>
Don't hang UP!
Shit! What the hell is this guy doin'?
I don't know.
Listen...
Maybe I ought to get some donuts
or something, huh?
Two one-way tickets
to Los Angeles, please.
Still gonna make our schedule?
Don't worry.
I'll get you there on time.
Don't have any illusions.
- Illusions?
- Illusions.
Illusions.
I'm sorry, sir.
This card's been canceled.
Huh?
Has it been canceled?
I'm sorry, that's a mistake.
Would you please try it again?
- I checked it twice, sir.
- Please try it again.
Please try it again.
- Did you pay the bill?
- Shut up.
I'm sorry, sir. It's been canceled.
Ma'am, that is impossible. I pay my bills.
There is no way that that could be canceled.
- It's been canceled.
- Shut up!
- Please.
- It's canceled, sir.
- Would you like to try another credit card?
- I don't have any other credit cards.
- Or cash.
- Please, would you just try that again?
- No.
- All right.
Alonzo... Jack Walsh.
Federal Bureau of investigation.
This is an official business.
I'm taking this man and he's in my custody.
I'm taking him to Los Angeles, okay?
So please try this once more.
Jack Walsh is not the name
on that badge, sir.
Would you like me to call the FBI?
Or would you like to pay cash?
- How much is it?
- $264 for two tickets.
$264.
Here's $100.
- Got any money on you?
- A lot.
You call that a lot of money?
It's enough to get you
where I'm gonna get you.
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.
Got the whole fuckin' force after me, huh?
[laughs]
Who the fuck are you?
Special Agent Mosely, FBI.
Oh, goddamn it! I didn't do anything.
Relax. Just want to ask you
a few questions, that's all.
Yeah. Fucking A. Help yourself.
So what do you know about Jack Walsh?
Oh, no, no. Come on, come on.
Cigarettes are killers.
So are women.
Not the right woman. My wife
and I have a wonderful relationship.
She's stuck it out with me
through all of this.
Stuck it out with you and
all your millions, what a trooper.
I don't have millions, Jack.
I gave it all to charity, remember?
You didn't keep
just a little for yourself, Jon?
I kept enough to get away
and stay hidden.
Yeah, right.
You know, when we change buses in Chicago
you're gonna have a couple hours.
I think you'd be a better man
if you used that time to
look up your ex-wife and daughter.
It's a perfect opportunity.
Why don't you mind your own business?
Let me ask you this: Why is it you
haven't seen them in nine years?
- Why?
- Yeah.
Just to get you off my back
I'll tell you why.
She married a police lieutenant
and I'm not very popular
with the Chicago Police Department.
- Why aren't you popular with them?
- That's a whole other...
Do we know each other?
- Why?
- Why?
What did you do?
Why aren't you popular
with the Chicago Police?
That's something that
really doesn't concern you.
- Did she hurt you, Jack?
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.
- What are you sorry about?
- I'm sorry you're hurt.
- I'm not hurt.
- You just said you were hurt.
- I'm not hurt.
- You just said you were hurt.
- I didn't say I was hurt. You said I was hurt.
I asked you if you were hurt
and you said, "Yeah, I'm hurt."
That's because you made me say it.
You're startin'
to put words in my mouth.
Jack, you're a grown man.
You have control over your own words.
You're goddamn right I do.
So here come two words for you:
Shut the fuck up!
Excuse me.
Walsh called Moscone about
a half an hour ago
from outside Toledo.
He's on an interstate Coach Lines bus
headed for Chicago.
Come on.
Sir, what do we do with this guy?
Let him go.
Son of a bitch stole my cigarettes.
When's the last time
you had a chest X-ray?
You know about secondary smoke?
You could give people lung cancer
who are innocent
and trying to live healthy lives.
Why don't you just go back to sleep?
Leave me alone.
- Do whatever you have to do.
- Put the cigarette out.
Why don't you shut up
and leave me alone?
Put the cigarette out, Jack.
Put the cigarette out.
What a pain in the ass this guy is.
Thank you, thank you.
- I thought you were putting it out.
- No, I'm not putting it out.
Why aren't you popular
with the Chicago Police Department?
Sid's downstairs.
- What's up?
- I think you and I should talk.
Why are you hangin' around for?
Take a walk.
I heard somebody picked up Mardukas
in New York.
- It's old news, Sidney. I'm already on it.
- I don't have to tell you
<i>what)“ happen if he becomes
a government witness.</i>
I can assure you that
will not be the case.
I assumed you were
taking that position
but I am supposed to advise you
against such action.
Sidney, relax.
Have a cream soda.
Everything is gonna be
all over within a few minutes.
[sirens wailing]
Who the fuck are these guys?
Hands on the bus!
All right, spread 'em.
It's the fuckin' feds.
Remember me?
Agent Foster Grant.
Alonzo, aren't you gonna thank me
for doin' your job for you?
Thank you, Walsh.
[gunshots]
Let's get the fuck out of here!
Come on!
- What the hell are you doing?
- Keep moving.
What? No, no!
Wait a minute. Jesus Christ!
All right, I'm comin'!
- Come on!
- All right! Wait a minute!
Walsh, you son of a bitch!
- My God, my God!
- Shut up.
- What the hell was that?
- Shut up.
- Why were they shooting?
- Those are Serrano's people back there.
They're not even waiting
for you to get to jail.
You're turnin' me in.
Why are we runnin' away from the FBI?
'Cause I gotta bring you back myself,
otherwise I won't get my money.
I won't give you to the feds.
"Alonzo Mosely."
Isn't that the name you've been using?
Let me see that.
- Look at this wealth of information.
- What?
They got a tap on Moscone's line.
Son of a bitch!
What are you doin'?
What are you doin'?
How far do you think we're
gonna get in a stolen FBI car?
What's that for?
An inside joke between me and Alonzo.
- Tony Darvo, line one.
- Yeah?
Sorry, Jimmy. It didn't happen.
It didn't happen?
Say that again, Tony?
<i>It just didn't happen.</i>
I mean, there were cops all over the place.
There were a million
fuckin' feds all over.
Jimmy, it was... it was a mess.
- It was a real mess.
- You'd better get off the line, Jimmy.
- If they've got a tap on that line--
- Sidney, shut your fucking mouth!
Now listen to me, dummy.
Do they have Mardukas
in custody or not?
I don't, I don't, I don't know.
Jimmy, I don't know. The cops
are swarming all over the place.
<i>We couldn't see anything.</i>
Let me tell you two stupid
motherfuckers something.
I don't want to get another
phone call like this, because
if I do I'll get on a fuckin' plane,
and I'm gonna blowtorch the both of you.
Do you understand?
Are you gonna stop? I'm on the phone!
I'm talking to Jimmy.
What are you doin'?
I should've killed Walsh
in Chicago a long time ago.
Don't say a word to me, Sidney.
Don't say a fuckin' word to me.
I'll get up and I'll bury
this telephone in your head.
I can't believe this.
I haven't seen either of them in nine years
and the first thing outta my mouth is gonna be:
"Can I borrow a few hundred bucks?"
I have a feeling this is going
to be very good for you.
[bell rings]
You look fine.
<i>Who are you Ql-“ls?</i>
I'm your mother's ex-husband.
- Mom!
- Nice kid.
Hi, Gail.
- Hello.
- How're you doin'?
I'm doin' good.
Hi.
They mentioned you and him
on the news this morning.
- They did?
- Yeah.
What did they say? Anything good?
[chuckles]
No. Are you all right?
Yeah.
You're in a lot of trouble, Jack.
Can I come in for a few minutes, Gail?
Can I come in for a few minutes?
Yeah.
I won't stay long.
I just need to borrow
some money to get to LA.
You know I'm good for it.
Jack, I don't think I have
that kind of cash in the house.
I'm so embarrassed.
I'm just in a jam, Gail.
You look beautiful.
You don't look much like a criminal.
I'm a white-collar criminal.
Jason, go upstairs now.
Jack, you shouldn't be here.
If Ted comes home,
he's gonna arrest you and him.
- Arrest us?
- Yeah.
Then we'd really be in a lot of trouble 'cause
I'm afraid I'm a little short of bribe money.
All right, Jack, don't start.
Please, don't.
How is Lieutenant
whatever-his-name-is?
- It's captain now.
- Captain? Royalty.
Jack, I don't want any trouble.
Do you understand that?
Please, it is not a good day for this.
I mean it.
I'm sorry that my fugitive timetable
doesn't coincide
with your social calendar.
- I don't think she was saying that.
- Stay out of this, Jon.
Alright, same old Jack,
you get your feelings hurt and then you
just walk around and hurt everybody else.
The last thing I need now is one of your lectures!
I'm not lecturing you, stupid!
I'm trying to protect you!
- Come on!
- Ted is gonna be home any minute.
We're all going out.
It's an important night for us.
Important night? What's so important
about tonight? Wait, let me guess.
- What is it, payoff night?
- Alright, that's it! Get out!
- Let's not fight.
- Gail, listen! I'm in a big fuckin' jam!
I just need to borrow some money
so I can get this guy back to LA
and I'm out of this
miserable fucking business forever!
Can't you understand that?
Hi.
Denise?
You got so big.
- I'm sorry. I'm gonna go now. I'm sorry.
- No, hold on.
I'm sorry, honey.
It's just, we're havin' a...
What grade are you in now?
Eighth.
Are you in the eighth grade?
Here's $40. That's all I've got,
but these are the keys to my car.
It's the station wagon
in the driveway.
- I'll tell Ted that it's in the shop.
- Okay.
And we'll worry about it
when you get back to LA.
So, does he take good care of you?
Yeah?
Well, that's all I wanted to know.
So what's he gonna say about this?
- He'll understand.
- Yeah, that's love, y'know?
Bye, honey.
Wait.
It isn't much.
About $180 babysitting money.
- Sweetheart, I can't.
- Take it.
- I can't.
- Please.
- Take it.
- I can't, sweetheart.
Hello. I'd like to make a collect call
to an Eddie Moscone from a Jack Walsh.
[phone rings]
Moscone's Bail Bonds.
Jerry, Jack, put Eddie on the phone.
Eddie, it's Jack.
Jack, stop fuckin' around.
Where are you?
Where am I? I'm in Boise, Idaho.
No,no, no, wait a minute.
I'm in Anchorage, Alaska.
No, no, no, wait.
I'm in Casper, Wyoming.
I'm in the lobby of a Howard Johnson's
and I'm wearing a pink carnation.
What the fuck
are you talkin' about?
I'm not talkin' to you.
I'm talkin' to the other guys.
What other guys?
Let me describe the scene to you.
There's these guys, see.
They've probably been up
for like two days.
They stink of B.0.
They have coffee breath.
They're constipated from sitting
on their asses for so long.
They're sitting in a van
and they're probably parked
right up the street
from your office.
But now, you guys, you're gonna
have to pack up all your shit and go home,
<i>because I'm onto you, you dumb fucks.</i>
<i>Eddie, your phone is tapped.</i>
<i>Listen, I'm not going to use
this line anymore. Go to Chin Loo 's.</i>
I'll call you there in five minutes.
They can't run a tap that fast.
So long, everybody.
[phone rings]
Excuse me, buddy. I got it, I got it, I got it!
I think it's for me. Jack, that you?
Listen, I need you to wire me $500
to the Western Union office
in Amarillo, Texas right away.
Wait a minute. What do you
need with $500 on a bus?
And why the fuck
aren't you on a plane?
Did it ever occur to you
that I am a professional
and that I might have my reasons?
We are driving now, and I only have
enough cash to get to Amarillo.
We had to scrap the bus.
Fuck the bus! I wanna know
what happened to the goddamn plane!
- He doesn't like to fly.
- He doesn't like to fly?
What the fuck does that mean?
Listen to me, Jack!
You gotta be back here in less
than two and a half fucking days.
A half million dollars of my money!
What the fuck is goin' on there?
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, I swear to God, don't start
with me now or I will shoot him
and I will dump him
in a fuckin' swamp!
I am in no fuckin' mood for this.
Just send me the money and
I'll have him back by the deadline.
- You hear me?
- Yes.
Let's go.
Jerry, wire $500 to Jack Walsh
in Amarillo, Texas right away.
Amarillo, Texas. Now, listen.
Also, get Dorfler down there!
Find him and get him down there, too.
- You got it, Eddie.
- Shit!
[door slams]
<i>[Jon singing] If one of those bottles
of beer should fall,</i>
<i>96 bottles
of beer on the wall.</i>
<i>96 bottles of beer on the wall,</i>
Ba-ba-boom.
Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-boom.
Nine...
93 bottles of beer on the wall.
Why were you so unpopular
with the Chicago Police Department?
'Cause of your personality?
What happened back at your house?
What was that all about?
Your wife married
a corrupt police officer?
What was it all about?
That whole fuckin' department
was corrupt.
There's good and bad everywhere,
don't you think?
I'd say there's bad everywhere.
Good I don't know about.
What happened to you?
I wouldn't go on the payroll.
What payroll?
I was workin' undercover.
I was close to this guy,
this big heroin dealer in Chicago.
He supplied the whole city.
Took me a year just
to get his confidence.
Just when I was about to nail the son
of a bitch my fellow officers
mysteriously discovered seven pounds
of heroin in my house.
So this big-time drug dealer
gave me a choice:
Get on the payroll
like everybody else,
get out of town,
or go to jail for 30 years.
Well, I didn't get on the payroll.
And that's why I do this.
When I find a criminal like you,
I bring him in.
I don't have to worry
about anybody takin' a payoff
because there is no anybody.
There's just me.
Why don't you
get yourself a new watch?
I'll tell you when I know you better.
When you know me better? When will you get
to know me better? I'll get to know you better.
- You're not gonna get to know me better.
- Will you shut up?
That's what I mean.
How much money do we have left?
- That's it?
- That's it.
We're starvin',
and you're buying cigarettes?
I need these cigarettes.
You can have your whatever
you're gonna have, I'll have this.
What can I do for you boys?
Coffee, please.
- How much is the coffee?
- It's 53 cents.
- How much is tea?
- 53 cents.
I'll have tea.
Our breakfast special today
is chorizo and eggs.
- Chorizo and eggs?
- Chorizo and eggs. Yes.
- What is that?
- It's a Mexican sausage
mixed in with scrambled eggs.
It comes with hash browns and toast.
We won't be havin' that. Thank you.
What time you got?
Ten to nine.
Alright, in 10 minutes we'll be
at the Western Union office, we'll have $500,
and I'll buy you a nice juicy steak
or whatever you want, okay?
- Chorizo and eggs?
- Huh?
- Chorizo and eggs?
- I'll get you whatever you want.
You know, Jon,
you're in this mess
because you're in this mess.
I didn't put you in this mess.
Do you understand?
Yeah.
If you had left Jimmy Serrano alone,
this wouldn't be happening.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I had a way out of this, you know.
Oh, yeah
7?
What's the thing
Serrano's most afraid of?
<i>Gain' cross-country with you.</i>
Gettin' knocked off by his own people.
What I know about
his financial transactions
could not only put him away but
every mob guy he ever did business with.
That's why he wants to kill me.
I was gonna put all his records
on computer disks.
I figured if things got too rough
I could always trade them for my life.
So what happened?
What happened was I got arrested
before I had a chance to do it.
Why didn't you just leave him alone?
You don't look like the kind of guy
who'd be involved in that sort of--
Why didn't you just leave
that heroin dealer alone?
I was a mob accountant.
I thought I worked
in a legitimate firm.
When I found out I was managing
accounts that were fronts for Serrano
I couldn't just sit back and do nothing.
Yeah, but Jon, you still took
what didn't belong to you.
How can you be
on the side of a mobster?
- I'm not on the side of a mobster.
- You're on his side if you're not on my side.
I'm not on anybody's side.
I got nothing to do with it.
You got everything to do with it.
You're takin' me to jail
and in jail you know I'll be killed.
- That's not my problem.
- It's not your problem?
It's not your problem?
Did you read about me in the papers?
- Yeah, I did.
- Were you on my side then?
- Yeah, I was.
- Then why aren't you now?
- Because now you're in my way.
- I'm in your way?
What you mean is you want the money
for turning me in
because that's all you're about.
You're just about the fuckin' money.
Hey, Jon.
You can think
whatever you want to think.
Doesn't matter to me, 'cause I'm gettin'
my $100,000 any which way you want it.
Let's go.
Hey, Tony.
Tony, Hopalong Cassidy.
You got your camera?
Take a picture.
Come on,
they got these at the airport.
Should I get one
on the way back?
Come on. Put that away.
I'm not gonna tell you again.
Tony, there they are.
- How you doin', Jack?
- Shit.
Jimmy sends his regards.
Don't worry, Jack.
We're not here for you.
We're here for him.
What are you starin' at?
Are you gonna propose?
Drop 'em!
I said, "Drop 'em," assholes!
Who the fuck are you guys?
Who the fuck are you?
You're dead.
You know who you're fuckin' with?
No. Why don't you tell me about it?
Make sure you speak
into the microphone.
Marvin, Marvin!
Very clever, Jack. Now give me the keys.
Come on! Give me the keys!
Keys.
Looks like a package deal
to me, Marvin.
Goddamn it. Come on! Both of you!
Who the hell were those guys?
- Marvin, you did it this time.
- What are you talkin' about?
Those are hired killers back there.
- Hired to kill who?
- Hired to kill this guy.
- Me. Me, can you believe it?
- Hired by who?
Hired by who? Jimmy Serrano.
That's who.
Oh, fuck.
Why do they want to kill this guy?
Don't you read the papers,
knucklehead?
- Yeah, I read the fuckin' papers.
- I can't take this.
They got away. Grey Dodge.
Get after them.
How the fuck
did you know where we were?
- I can't take this.
- Shut up a minute. Did Eddie put you on this?
- Of course Eddie put me on this.
- That son of a bitch!
- You know I have a contract with him?
- You got a contract?
- Yeah, I signed it on Monday.
- He called me in Pittsburgh.
He said you were
fucking this thing up.
I'm not fuckin' anything up.
You should've been in LA two days ago.
Hey Marvin, don't tell me how to do my
goddamn job! I'm half-thinkin' not to turn him in
just to watch Eddie
go down the fuckin' toilet.
- See, that's a good thought.
- What? Who the hell's talkin' to you?
Yeah, who the fuck's talkin' to you? He's not yours
to take anymore, limpdick. He's mine.
[helicopter approaching]
Do you hear that?
Fuck! Now who the fuck is this?
[gunfire]
Jesus Christ!
Do something!
You guys are the dumbest
bounty hunters I've ever seen!
[gunfire]
You couldn't even
deliver a bottle of milk!
[gunfire]
[Jon screams]
Will you shut the fuck up?
Where the hell did he go?
- You think we lost him?
- I don't know. I don't see anything.
Oh, I'm sure we're completely safe.
[screams]
[gunfire]
[horn honks]
[tires screech]
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine. I'm enjoying it.
- Marvin, Marvin, give me a gun.
- No fuckin' way!
[gunfire]
- Will you give me a fucking gun?
- Give him a gun, Marvin!
Don't fuck me, Jack!
Yeah, yeah.
[gunfire]
Shit.
They're not after me.
Just kidding, just kidding.
- Thought you threw those away.
- Always check the evidence, Marvin.
Those were car keys.
[screams]
[gunfire]
Son of a bitch! There goes $100,000.
$100,000? Eddie was gonna
pay you $100,000?
. Why? What was he gonna pay you?
<i>'</i> $25,000.
Son of a bitch!
[gunfire]
Holy shit, Jack! You got him!
[laughs]
Marvin!
What the hell are you doin', Jack?
See you in LA, Marvin.
[Jack]: Jon! Jon!
Jon! Where the fuck are you, Jon?
Give me your hand. I'm slippery.
I can't hold on. Give me your hand.
<i>Where are you gain'?</i>
Jon!
Jon!
Good.
- Promise you'll let me go?
- What?
Do you promise to let me go?
Fuck you!
- Promise to let me go!
- Fuck you.
You're making it very difficult for me
to do the right thing here.
All right. I promise I'll let you go.
Jesus.
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.
Thanks for saving my life.
Thanks for lettin' me go.
I'll let you go, all right.
The second you're in LA County Jail.
Come on.
Yeah, that's right. Down here!
Are you gonna stand there
with your thumb up your ass
or are you gonna get me
the fuck out of here?
This just came in.
Is this gonna upset me?
I think it's safe to say that.
Are you familiar with a dish,
a potato dish, lyonnaise potato?
It's a kind of fried potato.
But it's got, like, an onion in it.
It's quite delicious.
It really goes beautifully
with steak, chops,
you know, hamburger, cheeseburger,
any of your meat dishes.
It's just a...
You know, I have... I have
enough money to buy
- Look.
- ...as much lyonnaise potatoes
- ...as you ever would enjoy.
- Just shut the fuck up, will you, please?
I just think you ought
to think about it a little bit,
because it's nothing...
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute.
Oh, thank you, thank you.
Thank you. Very much.
Cover that.
Hi, you think you could give us
a ride to the next town?
- Sure. Jump in the back.
- Thanks a lot.
Great, great. See? For every shit,
there's six nice people.
- Jahé, everyone. Jahé.
- Jahé.
What's that?
It's "Hello." I can say "Hello"
in a lot of different languages.
Not yours, but a lot of them.
Welcome, sir.
- I'm not lookin' forward to this.
- What, do you think I am?
I don't understand the problem
with you two.
The guy's a fuckin' accountant.
Jimmy, it's been bad luck
right down the line.
Plus this guy Walsh is pretty good.
If he's that good, Tony,
maybe I should hire him to hit you.
I hope there's no chance of any
of this coming back to Jimmy.
No chance.
Rented the chopper out of Kansas City.
He's five times removed from you.
So you're clear of this. Don't worry.
Clear as shit, you fuckin' moron!
The guy is still out there, ain't he?
Let me tell you two guys somethin'.
I'm not interested in seein'
either of you two alive again
until you get the accountant,
you got the message?
[chickens squawking]
It's the end of the ride.
- This is it?
- This is it.
Is there a real... a real town
around here someplace?
- Channing.
- Channing?
Yeah.
How far is that from here?
- Thirty miles.
- Thirty miles. Jesus Christ.
[chickens clucking]
What the hell kind of town is this?
Is there someone that can give us
a ride to Channing?
Is there anyone going
in that direction?
No, don't have a ride.
Excuse me a minute.
Is there a bathroom
in there I could use?
Yeah, go ahead.
Is there a telephone here?
- Telephone.
- No, no, no telephone.
No telephone? Nothing.
[speaking other language]
[all laughing]
Glad you're all havin' a good time.
[engine sputtering]
Fear of flying, you son of a bitch?
Get over here!
Get back here, you son of a bitch!
Get over here! Stop!
Stop!
Fear of flying my ass,
you son of a bitch!
Get out of that plane!
You're a goddamn pilot,
you son of a bitch?
I didn't feel it was appropriate
to share that with you, Jack.
I'm gonna fucking appropriate
your head, goddamn it.
How do you turn this
fucking thing off?
Turn it off!
Turn it off!
Hang in there!
I'm gonna let it down easy!
Turn this fucking thing off!
Oh, shit!
Pilot? You're a goddamn pilot?
You're a pilot?
Here, I'll show you a pilot.
Let me tell you
about the coffee shop
I'm gonna open up
after I dump you off
and get my $100,000.
You're gonna love it.
All right, get back!
Get back! Get back!
Everybody back, back!
- Give me the keys to the truck.
- You can't steal their truck.
Shut up!
You were about to steal a plane!
- What are you talking about?
- I'm trying to save my life!
You're right,
I should give them something.
Give me your watch.
- My watch? Shit!
- Give me your watch!
Keep it. It's worth a lot of money.
Get in.
Stand back!
Get in.
Get in!
Jack, let's be fair about this.
You lied to me first.
- At the river.
- What? Get the fuck--
- At the river!
- You lied to me first.
- You got some fuckin' nerve!
- No. You lied to me first.
You lied to me first.
Yes, yes, I lied to you first
but you had no knowledge
I was lying about my fear of flying
at the river when you lied to me.
So as far as you knew,
you lied to me first.
Can't even argue with you.
I don't even know what the fuck you're talking about.
I'm just saying you lied to me first
as far as you knew.
Jesus.
- What's the matter?
- I got an ulcer.
- An ulcer?
- Yeah, I got an ulcer.
I got a big fucking ulcer,
and all your bullshit
started to make it bleed again.
You know why you have an ulcer?
Because you have
two forms of expression:
Silence and rage.
You should get some milk
to coat it.
Don't tell me what I need.
I need something to eat,
that's what I need.
What are we gonna buy it with? Dirt?
You drive to the next town.
I'll take care of it.
- You'll take care of it?
- I'll take care of it.
What do you mean,
you'll take care of it?
Drive to the next town.
But you lied to me first.
- Now what?
- Give me that FBI badge.
- The FBI badge?
- Yeah, give me the FBI badge.
Uncuff me.
- Uncuff you?
- Uncuff me.
Want to eat? Want a nice meal?
Want some of that shit you eat?
Come on. Uncuff me.
You fuck with me--
And you'll hit me on the head
and drop me in a thing.
Right. Come on.
Uncuff me.
- Who's in charge here?
- Who wants to know?
- Me.
- That'd be the manager.
I'd like to see the manager
as soon as possible.
Yes, sir.
Sorry.
- Yeah?
- Alonzo Mosely, FBI.
My partner and I have been
tracking a ring of counterfeiters
passing phony $20 bills
across the state.
Have you received any $20 bills
in the last couple of hours?
Yeah, sure,
we get 'em all the time.
You get them all the time. Would
you mind taking two steps backwards?
Would you mind opening the register?
No, don't touch them.
Excuse me.
Contract two, Hank. Check 'em out.
Give him a pencil, please.
Do the litmus configuration.
Doing the litmus configuration?
- Litmus configuration.
- Yes.
You seen any suspicious-looking
characters around here?
Nope.
- Do you live around here?
- Yep.
- How does it look?
- This one's bad.
Would you describe exactly
what the last man
who passed a $20 bill
to you looked like?
- Thirty. Tall.
- About 6 feet tall?
<i>_</i> 6! 5"-
- Dark brown hair?
Light colored.
- Sounds like our man.
- That's him.
We're gonna take
these bills for evidence.
Make them a receipt.
- This one's bad, too.
- This one's bad, too.
I'd like you to notify all
the other establishments
in the area of this situation.
What's the name of your establishment?
- Red's Corner Bar.
- Are you Red?
Yes, sir.
Do you dye your hair?
No.
Why do they call you "Red"?
It's short for Redwood.
My last name's Wood.
- What's your first name?
- Bill.
Thank you for your cooperation, Bill.
Hank.
These are all bad. Those are good.
- Come on. We're gonna get this train.
- What?
We're gonna catch this train.
Come on.
I can't catch a train.
You also couldn't fly.
Start running. Let's go.
Wait a minute. Wait!
It's a freight train!
I can't do this!
I can't do this!
I deeply feel I can't do this.
I thought you liked
to travel by train.
Get up there!
- What are you doing?
- Promise to let me go?
- Open the fuckin' door!
- See you in the next life, Jack.
Son of a bitch!
You son of a bitch!
Open that fuckin' door!
Glad to see me?
I guess we're in the next life, Jon.
- Don't overreact now.
- Don't overreact?
I won't overreact! Get over here!
Overreact?
You do this again,
I'll throw you off the fuckin' train!
Jack, Jack, it's a bad--
Get down there!
Put your hand in there!
- Easy, Jack. Easy, easy.
- There.
You son of a bitch!
- Jack?
- You shut up!
I'm not talking to you
for the whole rest of this trip!
Hey, you guys gonna let me go or what?
I'm telling you I don't know anything.
Is that a fact?
Oh, shit.
Why don't you quit?
It'd be cheaper for both of us.
Where are they?
You got me.
- Inspector.
- Shut up.
Now you listen, you son of a bitch.
I want answers
and I want them right now.
What do you want from me?
I don't know nothin'.
Sir...
It seems that an Agent Alonzo Mosely
and his partner
were seen hopping a westbound
freight train near Channing.
Come on.
[horn sounds]
- Jack?
- What?
How much further
do you think we have to go?
[imitating Jack]
None of your fuckin' business!
You know, because eventually
I'm gonna have to go to the bathroom.
[imitating Jack]
Shut the fuck up!
Did you ever have sex
with an animal, Jack?
Remember those chickens
around the Indian reservation?
<i>There were some good-Rankin'
chickens there, Jack.</i>
You know, between us.
Yeah, there were a couple there
I might have taken a shot at.
What's with you and that watch?
What is it with the watch?
You told me when you
get to know me better.
You told me about your feelings
for chickens.
How private could the watch be?
What's the big secret?
Gail bought me this watch.
She gave it to me.
It was the first thing
she ever gave me.
She, uh... she bought it
because I was always late
by at least a half an hour.
So she bought it and set it ahead
a half an hour so I'd never be late.
Somewhere in the back of my mind
I keep thinking we're gonna
wind up together again.
I don't know why I'm still hanging on.
I'm still waitin' around.
<i>1 don't think she's cumin' back.</i>
Yeah, I don't either.
I don't either.
Sometimes you just have to let go.
Just get yourself a new watch.
You're okay, Jack.
I think...
under different circumstances...
you and I...
probably still would've
hated each other.
[both laugh]
We probably could've been friends.
In the next life.
Yeah, the next life.
Yeah, great.
Accommodations were wonderful.
- You got a smoke?
- Don't smoke.
That fed took my cigarettes.
You want your cigarettes back?
Then you're gonna have to go
to Flagstaff to get 'em,
'cause that's where
your pal Mosely went.
[chuckles]
Just might do that.
Where do you figure we are?
My guess would be Arizona.
We've been goin' west all night.
I think we're almost home.
I'm almost dead.
Hey, look, John.
You know, the Witness
Protection Program isn't so bad.
They'll give you a new name.
You'll have a new life.
I'm not gonna make it
to any witness protection program.
- You don't know that, Jon.
- I know it. You know it.
Serrano's gonna get to me before I get
to any Witness Protection Program.
Do me a favor.
Don't pretend you care about me.
It really insults my intelligence.
I mean, let's face it.
The only important thing
about me to you
is gettin' your money.
You know, I'm really tired of you
makin' me out to be some kind of thug
whose only concern
is a big chunk of change.
Did you know that Serrano's people
offered me $1,000,000 for you?
Why didn't you go for the big money?
You're doing his work for him anyway.
I'm workin' for him anyway?
You don't know what
the fuck you're talkin' about.
The reason I do this shit
in the first place
is 'cause I wouldn't work
for that lowlife asshole.
- What does that mean?
- Nothin'.
Doesn't mean anything.
Serrano is the heroin dealer
you told me about in Chicago?
Who owned your buddies
and destroyed your life?
That's Serrano?
That's the guy
that you're takin' me in...
That's the guy that's gonna kill me?
Hope it's a wonderful
coffee shop, Jack.
- Come on. We're gettin' off.
- What? What? What?
We are getting off here,
Mr. Railroad Man.
- Come on.
- What? What? No, come on!
- You should be good at this.
- What are you talkin' about?
Come on!
Let's discuss this!
- Find anything?
- Not yet.
They could've jumped off the train
anywhere along the line.
Trains have regularly scheduled stops.
The reason for that is, y'know, because people plan
to get off the trains when they stop.
And that's how,
generally, people do it.
They don't, like, throw
each other off the trains.
That's the purpose of having stops.
What's this?
What are you gonna do?
What are you doin' now?
What are you doin'?
What are you doin'?
Oh, Christ, Christ!
Come on! Come on!
Are you kidding?
They're gonna come out
and shoot us, for Christ's sake.
What the hell?
What the hell?
Jesus.
Oh, great!
You get it started...
and I'll run you over.
That's the best plan I can think of.
[engine starts]
Congratulations. Another crime.
Come on.
I don't like this.
I don't like anything you do,
to tell you the truth. Nothin'.
Where are we going?
To the nearest airport.
[sirens]
I'm not the kind of guy that says,
"I told you so," but...
Oh, shit!
Looks like they've been spotted
around 35 miles south
of here near Sedona.
There are officers in pursuit.
Let's take the chopper.
This is- this is- this is the kind of situation
where something bad happens.
Easy!
Goddamn it, I don't like this!
[screams]
[horn honks]
Truck!
- Where are you goin', Jack?
- You'll find out when we get there.
I've come too far.
Too far.
I'm too close.
[screams]
[helicopter whirring]
Okay. I'm coming. All right.
- Come on.
- All right.
Here we go.
Hello! Hello!
Am I lucky, or am I just good?
Is that Marvin?
[chuckles]
Fuckin' A. I'm the best.
Marvin?
Hello, Jack, you dumb shit.
- Come on, you fuckin' pain in the ass!
- What was that?
Wait a minute.
If you move,
I'll tear your fuckin' lungs out!
See you in LA, Jack.
Shit.
Afternoon, sir.
- You're open?
- Oh, we're always open.
Hard day, huh?
Hard week.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I could use a cup of coffee.
Yes sir.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
Keep 'em.
Gee, I been lookin'
all over for these.
Thanks, Alonzo.
Marvin, I have to tell you,
I have this very serious
fear of flying.
Yeah?
Why don't you just relax
and sleep through it?
Forget your deadline, Walsh.
That's over.
That's the way that one went.
I know my rights.
You owe me phone calls.
What should be of paramount importance
to you right now is not the phone call
but the fact that you're
gonna spend 10 years
for impersonating a federal agent.
- 10 years for impersonating a fed, huh?
- 10 years.
10 years. How come no one's after you?
Give this guy his calls.
Thanks.
Can I have a little privacy, please?
[phone rings]
Moscone's Bail Bonds.
It's Jack Walsh. Put Eddie on.
It's Jack.
Yeah. This better be good news, fuckin' Jack,
because you got five hours left.
No, it's not, Eddie.
I'm callin' to let you know that
you're a dead motherfucker.
You understand me?
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
You put Marvin on this case,
you fucking piece of shit.
<i>You're fucking deceptive. You vermin!
You serpent!</i>
- Are you fuckin' done yet?
- You slime ball in a sea of pus!
- What?
- You blew it, all right?
You had the guy four fuckin' days,
Jack, four days!
You could've fuckin'...
you could've walked him backwards
and not fuckin' blown it,
but you blew it.
When have I ever let you down,
you fuckin' rat?
Are you fuckin' nuts,
tellin' Dorfler I offered you $100,000
when I told him I'd give him $25,000?
- When did you speak to him?
- What's the difference?
When did you speak to Marvin?
He called me fuckin', what, ten minutes ago
yellin' and screamin',
tellin' me to go fuck myself.
You're tellin' me, everybody's
tellin' me to go fuck myself?
<i>Am I supposed to just sit
on my fuckin' butt?</i>
Eddie,
what are you fucking'talkin' about?
Look, you got five hours left.
Can you bring the fuckin' Duke in, yes or no?
I thought he's bringin' him to you.
I just talked to fuckin' Dorfler.
He don't have the Duke.
- What?
- Where's the fuckin' Duke?
- Hello?
- I'll talk to you later.
Jack!
- Hello?
- Yeah, Tony Darvo there, please?
- Who's calling?
- Marvin Dorfler.
Yo.
<i>[Man]: I got Marvin Dorfler on the line.
Shall I put him through?</i>
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Put him through.
Marvin.
Everything still on schedule,
pal, isn't it?
So Dorfler's workin' for you guys.
- Who is this?
- This is Jack Walsh.
Jack, what are you complainin' for?
We came to you first, didn't we?
It's Jack Walsh.
Hold on. Somebody wants to say hello.
Hey.
Too late for you, scumbag.
No, no, no, too late for you.
I didn't come this far
not to collect my money.
You understand me, you motherfuckers?
I want the Duke back.
So what the fuck
are you tellin' me for?
What am I tellin' you for?
What am I tellin' you for?
I'll tell you what
I'm tellin' you for.
I got some of the Duke's belongings.
That's why.
Including some computer disks
that have every last detail
of Serrano's businesses
and his money-laundering operations. Everything.
<i>And if I don't get the Duke back
in the next two hours</i>
I'm gonna turn those disks over
to the feds. You hear me?
<i>You tell Serrano
I want to meet him with the Duke</i>
<i>alone in two hours in the main
terminal of McCarran Airport</i>
where we'll make the exchange.
I know he's the only one
of you fucking idiots
who won't try to take a shot at me
in a public place,
and if I see one fuckin' single goon
within a mile of that airport...
<i>Now listen to me very carefully...</i>
...the deal is off,
and I'm going to the feds.
I ain't gonna bother Jimmy
with your bullshit.
You're not? Okay, fine. Fine.
After he's busted
I'll make sure to let him know
you knew all about it beforehand.
<i>That's two hours from now.
Main terminal, McCarran Airport.</i>
You got that, moron? Have a nice day.
Tell Alonzo I want to make a deal.
You want to make a deal with me?
What would you do
if I could deliver you Serrano?
What do you mean, "deliver"?
For starters, conspiracy to destroy
government evidence.
What government evidence?
Will you let me take the Duke back
myself and collect my money?
Tell me more.
I'll have to tell you on the way
'cause we gotta be
in Las Vegas in two hours.
[JON] : Marvin?
- Marvin?
- No, it's room service.
Here. Hold this up...
so they know I took this today.
I amaze myself. I'm always thinking.
Got it all figured out.
- Now say, "Cheese."
- Don't do this, Marvin.
<i>Adios.</i>
All right.
There are no real computer disks.
- Is that right?
- Right.
So if you give him blank disks...
and he accepts them would that
still be considered an overt act?
If he just sets foot
inside the airport
he's committed an overt act,
conspiracy to obstruct justice.
When he shows up with the Duke,
you add kidnapping.
Anybody packing a gun,
conspiracy to commit murder.
The fact that it's an airport,
and Alonzo, correct me
if you think I'm wrong here.
I don't want to
step on your toes.
You can slap an interstate
transportation aid
or racketeering rap
on him right away as well.
Yeah, well none of that
bullshit means anything
unless you can get him
to take those disks from you.
Don't worry.
I'll get him to take the disks.
Get a wire on this man.
Marvin.
No hard feelings about
what happened back in Amarillo, huh?
Just one of those
spur-of-the-moment deals, you know?
- Where is he?
- Where's the money?
In the car. Where is he?
Slight change of plans.
Now I want $2 million.
What?
I read the newspapers, you know?
The guy got you
for $15 million, right?
So I figure he's gotta be worth
at least $2 million.
I'm a businessman.
How do we know you got him?
I want $1 million now...
and I'll call you in 20 minutes,
tell you where to drop off
the second million.
Once I know it's there,
then I'll tell you where he is.
Okay?
- Not okay.
- Why not?
What are you, fucking nuts?
What's Jimmy gonna say?
How the fuck we gonna get the Duke now?
You got the answer
right in your hand!
What are you talkin' about?
Joey, when are you gonna learn
how to pay attention?
Look. See what it says there?
All right. This is it.
Tonight is the fucking night.
You understand?
I'm sick of all of these screw-ups.
As soon as I get the disks from Walsh,
you guys drop Walsh
and you drop the Duke. Do you understand?
I get the disks, you drop them. Okay?
- I don't think you should do this.
- Oh, really?
What do you propose that I do?
Send somebody with a cash offer,
but don't do this.
I know Walsh.
He won't take any money from me.
He's a very self-righteous
type of guy.
It aggravates me.
In his mind, this is clean.
He gets what he wants,
I get what I want.
- The guy's a fuckin' burnout, Sidney.
- Hey, Jimmy...
Sidney, sit down, relax, have a sandwich,
drink a glass of milk. Do some fuckin' thing, will 'ya.
He's on his way.
<i>[Agent]: He's heading north
on Las Vegas Boulevard,</i>
<i>approximately two miles
from the airport. We're right on him.</i>
Why are you smiling?
I feel like a cop again.
So I'm finally in the
presence of greatness, huh?
The Duke.
The guy that steals money
from the scum of the earth
and gives it to the unfortunates
of the world.
I wanted to meet you face to face.
Did you actually think that
you were gonna steal my money
and get away with it?
I stopped by here
to tell you two things:
Number one is that
you're gonna die tonight.
Number two: I'm gonna go home,
have a nice hot meal...
...I'm gonna find your wife,
and I'm gonna kill her, too.
Joey, wait here for my call.
The rest of you start going in.
You got it.
Here he comes.
Jack. Long time no see.
Long time no see.
I see you're still spendin'
all your money on clothes.
- You know...
- Listen, while you're in town
<i>if you want to go see a show
or you want a free meal or something</i>
<i>like that you just
let me know, all right? On me.</i>
That's the type of guy I am.
You're a real sport.
Just give him the disks.
How's your mother?
She's all right.
Daughter's gettin' big, growing up.
You know, I was thinkin' maybe if we would've
clone business way back when,
you wouldn't look like a guy
with a fucking cup in your hand.
- I'm tryin' to make a living.
- Yeah.
Listen, Jack, you got those disks
or did you lose them
like you lost your job?
Give him the disks, Walsh.
I see you, but I don't see the Duke.
- We'll worry about him in a minute.
- We gotta worry about him now.
Let me tell you somethin', Jimmy.
This isn't a reunion.
If I don't see the Duke
in about five seconds, I'm walking.
You know,
you're still way too serious.
Really. Listen.
Why don't you just hand over the tapes,
we'll take a walk,
we'll go get the guy together.
Fuck you.
I'll see you at the arraignment.
Hey, Jack, Jack. Hey.
Where the hell is he goin'?
You win, all right?
- I what?
- You won.
What do you want me to do,
yell it all over this fucking airport?
Where is he?
- He's on his way.
- You know I said no goons.
Never mind him.
You're gonna get what you want.
Didn't I just tell you that?
This thing is gonna give me
a heart attack before it's all over.
I know I'm gonna
get a heart attack.
Since we have this moment
to share together
there's something
I've been meaning to ask you.
Doesn't it bother you that another
copper is fuckin' your wife?
Do you know
they made this guy a captain?
Can you imagine that?
Go figure it out. Made him a captain.
- Can I help you, sir?
- Give me a one- way ticket to LA.
One-way ticket to Los Angeles.
Will that be smoking or non-smoking?
Take a wild guess.
Smoking.
And how will you
be paying for this, sir?
- Oh shit.
- What?
Look.
What the hell is he doing here?
Alright, we have a male Caucasian
carrying a green duffel bag
with his hands inside his vest
approaching the subjects.
Get him out of there as quickly
and as quietly as possible.
Shoot him if you have to,
but get him out of here.
- You okay, Jon?
- Yeah.
- Stand behind me.
- It's all right.
Alright, come on.
- Hey, how's everybody doin'?
- Get out of here, Marvin.
Back off, everybody. Back off.
- Who the fuck are you?
- What, are you writin' a book? Who the fuck are you?
Who is this guy?
Jesus.
Marvin, Marvin. You're missin'
the bigger picture here.
I'm telling you, get out of here.
Wire's gone dead.
Are you crazy?
I didn't come all
this way for nothin'.
- Serrano's leaving.
- Did he take the disks?
I don't know.
- Serrano's got the disks.
- Let him go, Jack.
Serrano's got the disks.
Did he or did he not take the disks?
I couldn't tell.
There's too much goin' on down there.
Serrano's got the disks.
He's got the disks.
Marvin! Marvin, Marvin, look out!
Marvin, Marvin, Marvin, look out!
If you think I'm fallin' for
that shit again you're crazy.
Marvin! Marvin, look out!
You stupid fuck, will you look out!
Serrano's got the disks!
Serrano's got the disks!
Move in.
[all shouting]
Take it easy! Come on!
Ow! Goddamn it!
Who the fuck are you guys?
Jimmy, there's somethin' I've been
wanting to say to you for ten years.
- Oh, yeah? What's that?
- You're under arrest.
We'll catch up with each other
one of these days.
Maybe we will.
- We still got our deal?
- We got our deal.
Hey, wait a minute! What deal?
Why the fuck does he get special treatment?
See you in LA, Marvin.
Watch your cigarettes
with this guy, Jack.
<i>What's gain' on?</i>
Sorry, Jon. I got an hour and a half
to get you back to LA.
Thanks, Alonzo.
[phone rings]
Yeah, Moscone's Bail Bonds.
- Hello, Eddie. Where's Jerry?
- Yeah?
Never mind Jerry.
Where the hell are you, Jack?
Feds picked him up 20 minutes ago.
- Yeah, what for?
- What's the difference, man?
I never trusted that guy anyway.
- Where the hell are you?
- Where am I? I'm at the airport.
And guess who I'm with?
I'm with the Duke.
You got him! You got him, Jack!
I love you!
- You want to say hello?
- Yeah. Put him on.
- Say hello.
- Hello.
Hello, you son of a bitch!
<i>We got you.</i>
<i>you son of a bitch!</i>
Now say goodbye,
you lying little piece of shit,
because I'm letting him go.
Jack?
Would've been a nice coffee shop.
Oh, Jesus. Oh.
I don't get it.
I did what I wanted to do, Jon.
I got you to LA
before midnight, so...
I don't know what to say.
Don't say anything.
Knowing you, you'll make me want
to put those back on you again.
Thanks.
- No, Jon, thank you.
- Thank you.
Somethin' to remember
our adventure by.
Jack.
This better be good.
This is good.
This is very good.
When I was makin' my getaway,
I thought the FBI
was closin' in on me.
Take it, take it.
I took some traveling money.
Take it, take it.
It's not a payoff. It's a gift.
You already let me go.
You son of a bitch.
- You son of a bitch.
- Told you I had money.
I know you had money,
but I didn't know you had money.
How much is here?
Neighborhood of $300,000.
That's a... that's a very
respectable neighborhood.
I don't know what to say, Jon.
Take care.
- Take care.
- See you in the next life.
- See you in the next life.
- See you in the next life.
- Do you know what time it is?
- 25 to 12:00.
25 t012:00.
I would've made it.
You wouldn't have change for $1,000,
would you?
[Driver]: What are you, a comedian?
Get out of here, you bum!
Looks like I'm walkin'.
