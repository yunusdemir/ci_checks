This is Sophie Hall from The New Yorker.
Hi, Mr. Beal. Thank you for calling me back.
No, I am not. I'm not a writer.
I'm a fact checker, actually.
It is a bit like being a detective, yes.
Let's see if you are the Robert Beal
that I'm looking for.
Can... can you confirm where you were
when you found out World War II was over?
Oh, Poughkeepsie? All right.
Right, thank you so much.
Yes, the moment the war ended.
Oh, Palm Beach? Okay. Lucky guy.
Thank you very much. Bye.
Bobby, hey, I got nothing, uh...
but there's two more Robert Beals,
and one petty officer, third class.
Wait.
Oh. I'm gonna call you back.
Sophie Hall.
Can you confirm where you were when
you found out World War II was over?
Times Square?
I'm in Times Square right now.
I'm standing exactly where
the photograph was taken.
I really thought I would never find you.
So, can you... Can I ask you to
describe what you saw that day?
The kiss, was it spontaneous
or was it staged?
It was.
You're certain?
So you're 100% positive?
Petty Officer First Class Robert Beal,
who was the second sailor,
said that the nurse was the bee's knees
and that the kiss was
a completely spontaneous moment
and a celebration of real love.
- And he told you this himself?
- Yes, he did.
'Cause it's not often that I request
a personal audience with a fact checker.
It's 'cause I need to know you're sure.
I'm 100% positive.
Great.
I guess people wanna believe
in true love, don't they?
Speaking of which, I understand
that you're headed off to Verona
for a pre-honeymoon?
Explain that to me.
It's just a vacation before the wedding.
It's our last chance to spend time alone
- before his restaurant...
- Well, it's the city of love, isn't it?
Yeah. But I...
Good choice, and good work. Thank you.
I was thinking. What if while I'm there,
I write?
But you're such a good fact checker.
- Have a great trip.
- Thank you. See you later.
Who goes on a honeymoon
without a wedding? You are so lucky.
Well, Victor's restaurant opens
in six weeks, so it's our last chance.
Okay, do not let him pay attention
to anything but you, okay?
- You throw his cell phone in the Adriatic.
- But he has to meet suppliers.
- Sophie...
- It's fine. I promise.
Okay. Wait, what?
Hey, sweetheart,
can I help you carry your magazine?
Okay, no problem.
Oh, my God.
Hey, close your eyes.
Close your eyes, close your eyes.
Close your eyes, close your eyes.
Close your eyes. Open your mouth.
- It's good?
- Yeah.
Yes? No? Yes?
Yes? I have reinvented the noodle,
I'm telling you.
Just try this one
because this one's really good.
It's the same thing, but different. Fatter.
- Mmm.
- More of, you know... No?
- It's good, right? Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.
You know, I mean, modestly speaking,
I think I'm creating a masterpiece.
I don't know. I mean, there's one
that just came out perfect right now,
- which is... I think it's this one. I think it's...
- Victor?
- Try it. Even though it's dry, try it.
- Victor, Victor...
- Can I just say something?
- What?
We're leaving in 12 hours,
and you haven't packed for Verona.
- At all.
- Yeah, that's right, that's right.
- Yeah. I get too carried away.
- Do we clean this up?
No, no.
- It's gonna be incredible.
I know. I'm so excited.
Sophia!
Sophia! Wherefore art thou,
my sweet Sophia?
- I love this place. I love. Right?
- It's amazing.
- I have to show you the most beautiful...
- You know what's even more amazing?
- What?
- I just got off the phone with Signor Morini,
and he's arranged a private tour for us
with each and every one of my suppliers.
We're starting off with the oldest and
most beautiful vineyard in all of Veneto.
Yeah?
Victor.
Sophie, come on. No, you're not getting it.
I mean, we're gonna go to the oldest,
the most beautiful vineyard around.
This is romantic. All right?
We're gonna go there,
we're gonna drink a little wine,
we're gonna get a little tipsy,
and we're gonna come back
and we're gonna...
I mean, how was it?
I tried to talk to Bobby again.
How did it go?
It didn't go,
because I didn't talk to him.
Why?
Because I was scared.
Really?
It's time for me to stop
checking facts and actually start writing.
Yeah, yeah, it's your passion.
You should do that.
It's the grape that I told you about
- that they use for the region, Soave?
- Right, right, right.
- You know. You remember?
- Yeah.
Mmm. Mmm!
Do you like?
- This is good.
Wow.
It's fresh flower and fruit. Do you feel it?
Yeah? You feel it? It's so good.
Smile.
Sophie.
Mmm! Mmm-hmm.
We have to get tickets to the opera
before they sell out.
- We need to see the Castelvecchio.
Yeah, yeah.
We have to see Lake Garda
- and Juliet's house.
Yeah, of course. Yeah.
Sophie, this is beautiful.
This is incredible. The smell...
Mmm!
Sophie, this is amazing! This is great!
I wish I was a little mouse
living in your cheese cave.
Hey, that was Signor Morini on the phone.
You know, he's inviting us
to this incredible forest,
that's just, like, 120 kilometers away.
- And they dig these exquisite truffles...
- Wait. 120 kilometers?
- Yeah, it's not like miles, Sophie.
- No, I understand the difference, but I just...
I just don't understand why you wanna go
120 kilometers to see a mushroom.
It's not a mushroom, okay?
It's a truffle. It's a tartufo. It's the thing
that you put on top of pasta, you know?
- A tartufo?
- It's something else. It's...
Come on, you've been
having a good day, right?
It was fine.
But now, I just...
To be honest, I don't really feel
like going to see a mushroom.
Okay, fine, I get it. I get it. It's fine. I get it.
I mean, just don't call it a mushroom, okay?
Yeah, okay.
You know what?
Why don't you go see the truffle place
- and I'll go do my thing and sightsee?
- Really?
Yeah. Win-win.
<i>"My dear Juliet... "</i>
<i>"Dear Juliet,
the man that I love is not my husband. "</i>
Are you okay?
Take this basket and... Come si dice?
Dig in.
Dig in?
You are the translator
from the employment office?
- No. No, I mean...
- I have been waiting two weeks.
I'm sorry. My name is Sophie.
I just... I followed you,
and I saw that you put
the letters into a basket,
and I just wondered why.
Why?
You are a writer?
Yeah, I am. I am a writer.
Come. I show you.
They come from all over the world
every day.
But taking their letters?
Is that not like taking pennies
from a wishing well?
How else can we give them answers?
Oh, my God. So, you write all of them back.
Yes.
- You're all Juliet?
- Her secretaries.
Donatella has been married
51 years to the same man.
She handles husband problems.
Husbands are like wine.
They take a long time to mature.
Francesca is a nurse.
She deals with illness and loss.
And Maria...
Why do you always sigh
when you say my name?
She has 12 children, 29 grandchildren,
and 16 great-grandchildren.
- She writes whatever she likes.
- And you?
Isabella answers the ones
you can barely read.
Yeah, the lovers' quarrels,
the breakups, the really tangled hearts.
Someone has to do it.
My mother.
Would you like to stay for dinner, Sophie?
Mamma, this is not an insult.
I make a beautiful dish,
big enough for the whole town,
and she says no.
I would love to, but I do... I have to go.
This is the problem of the americani.
- Always running.
- Please, Mamma.
I have to meet my fiancé.
Fiancé?
At least take some dessert
for you and your fiancé.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You know, 120 kilometers each way
and I'm still beating you?
- Congratulations.
- What? Yeah. What?
I mean, how was Verona?
How was it without me?
Empty? Half-empty? Completely empty?
Half-empty.
- I met the Secretaries of Juliet.
- Juliet?
- Like Juliet Capulet?
- Yeah.
There are these women that call themselves
the Secretaries of Juliet,
and they write letters to people
that write letters to Juliet.
And then these secretaries,
they work for the city of Verona,
and, like, all these people,
these brokenhearted women
all over the world,
come and they write letters
- and leave them on the wall.
- What's in the bag?
I don't know.
So, they post these letters.
They post them on the wall
in Juliet's courtyard,
and then these secretaries
come back with this basket
and they retrieve the letters every day.
And then they write back, as Juliet,
to all the letters that have
return addresses on them.
Mmm-hmm.
This is their job.
I mean, it's so unbelievable.
This is their passion.
It's what they do every day.
Mmm. Mmm.
- They literally will work all day, every day.
- Mmm! Oh, my God!
- And they've been doing it for years.
- Sophie. Wow. This is incredible!
And they...
This is incredible.
This is incredible. Oh, my God.
This is great. Try this, try this.
You have to try this. Oh, my God.
No... Give it a good bite. Come on.
Your Victor is very passionate.
Yes, yes, I know.
But he seems to think that
he's Italian since we got here.
And although imitation is, of course,
the highest form of flattery,
his imitations are not very good.
Okay, that woman is amazing.
I mean, she's incredible.
She's incredible. I think I'm in love.
- Absolutely.
- You're in love with her?
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Really?
Okay. Just say no.
Just say no, and I won't do it, really.
I mean, I'm dying to do it, but I won't.
Okay. What?
Angelina's offered to teach
me some secrets today.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
Okay, right now and all day?
Like, right now. That's crazy, right?
I mean, now. That's amazing.
I mean, she's making
risotto all'Amarone, right? Yeah?
- Good risotto.
- You see?
You see, it's, like, 300 years old
or something, her recipe. It's fantastic.
Okay. That's great. But...
So, no Lake Garda then today?
Oh, yeah. Lake Garda...
I mean, Lake Garda's been there
for, like, 500,000 years, you know.
And right now,
Angelina's offered to help me.
And, you know, I mean,
I'm here, we're here, you know.
- We're having a good time.
- You, Paul Newman,
you want to work, you have to watch!
You see? I mean, you see,
I became Paul Newman. All right?
Okay, what shall I do?
I mean, my hands are tied.
I don't know. I don't know.
You could help us if you like.
- Yeah! Yeah. The letter thing, right?
Why not?
Yeah, yeah, you write the letters
and I'll cook. And later we eat and...
Win-win.
How long have you
and Victor been engaged?
Almost a year.
Wow. And may I ask why don't
you wear an engagement ring?
Yeah, see, that's... That's me. I insisted.
He was so busy, you know,
this whole restaurant and everything.
And I guess I felt it unnecessary.
Still, a girl should have a ring.
"I didn't go to him, Juliet.
I didn't go to Lorenzo.
His eyes were so full of trust.
I promised I'd meet him
to run away together
because my parents don't approve.
But instead, I left him waiting
for me, below our tree,
waiting and wondering where I was.
I'm in Verona now.
I return to London in the morning,
and I'm so afraid.
Please, Juliet, tell me what I should do.
My heart is breaking,
and I have no one else to turn to.
Love, Claire. "
And it's been there for all those years?
I think she came back
to find her one true love.
And they had 10 children
and still make passionate love every night.
Except he got bald and fat
and she has to do all the work.
- Francesca.
- Francesca.
And maybe she stayed in London
and married a duke
and lived happily ever after, just like me.
- But you married an accountant, not a duke.
- Nobody's perfect.
And I bet when she's making love
to that duke...
- Yeah?
... she's imagining her first love, Lorenzo.
Isabella, I have to write back.
Then answer her.
Good night, friends.
Good night.
Hey.
Hey.
- Sorry I'm late.
- No, it's fine. No worries.
- How was your day? Good?
- It was...
- It was so good.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Good. I'm glad.
How was Angelina?
Yeah, it was good. I mean, she's amazing,
you know. That woman is incredible.
She's very instinctive, you know.
She cooks without recipes.
I mean, she's incredible.
- She's invited me to cook again.
- Really?
Yeah. Yeah,
I think I can learn a lot from her.
But...
No, no, you first, you first. Sorry, sorry.
- No, just real quick. I just...
- Mmm-hmm?
I had the most amazing day.
I got to answer a letter
that was written 50 years ago.
I know it might not get there,
but it just feels so good to write.
Yeah, I think you should
spend more time with them.
- Why?
- Because it's your passion, right?
And also because it fits perfectly.
Because I just got off the phone
with Signor Morini,
and he's invited me to this amazing
wine auction that's happening in Livorno.
- In Livorno?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's super-exclusive.
I mean, I don't know...
I don't know if I can get a ticket, you know.
I mean, I'll be off, like, a day or two, max.
If you want, I'll try to get two tickets,
- but I'm not sure I can get two tickets.
- Yeah.
To a wine auction? In Livorno?
Yeah, it sounds terrible. I know.
I'm sorry. I'm so... I feel terrible now.
I feel terrible. I mean, it's...
I miss you already, you know.
- I'll be back very soon. Okay?
- Yeah. Be careful.
Bye! Ciao.
Listen to what this poor girl writes.
"Juliet, is there anything worse
in this world than a man?"
Excuse me.
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but are you the Secretaries of Juliet?
 - Yes, that's us.
- Great.
May I ask, which one of you wrote this letter
to my grandmother, Claire Smith?
I wrote that.
And I can't believe that it found you.
Yes. We Brits tend to stay
in our family homes.
Yeah. This is amazing.
It's less than a week since I mailed it.
It was a very thoughtful letter.
Now, what were you thinking?
I was thinking that she deserved an answer.
Yeah, 50 years ago, maybe. Not now.
I'm sorry. I didn't know true love
had an expiration date.
True love? Are you joking?
Could you imagine what would've happened
if she hadn't seen sense?
Well, yeah, you wouldn't be here,
and that would be an upside.
What are you doing here anyway?
What, are you some lonely American girl
who has to live vicariously through others?
I'm not lonely. I am engaged.
My condolences to the groom.
Excuse me!
So that's it? You've come all the way
from London to give me a lecture?
No, I came because I couldn't let
my grandmother come on her own.
Claire is here? Why?
I think even you might be able
to work that one out.
Oh, my God!
That's awesome!
She's come to find her Lorenzo!
Awesome?
And if Lorenzo doesn't want to see her,
has forgotten her,
is gravely ill or dead,
let's say, just for fun, then what?
Thought so.
I want to meet her. I'd like to meet Claire.
And I want to play for Manchester United,
but I'm shit at football.
You don't think that she wants to meet me?
I honestly think she has no
interest meeting a woman
that can manage to jam, "Oh, my God"
and "awesome" into the same sentence.
Gran, they're closing up.
We should go now.
Excuse me. Claire? Hi. Hi.
My name is Sophie,
and I wrote you the letter.
Letter? From Juliet?
Goodness! Thank you.
Thank you. But however did you find us?
- Well, your grandson found me, actually.
- You did?
Right, well, the thing is,
- I thought we should...
- Yeah, well, he's very sweet
and very charming, and he thought
that you might like to meet me.
Uncharacteristically thoughtful of you, dear.
Yes, well, under the circumstances,
it seems a little churlish not
to meet the woman responsible
- for this voyage of lunacy.
- Okay.
Charlie doesn't approve,
which makes this all the more fun.
We were just going for a glass of wine.
Would you like to join us?
Absolutely not.
- What?
- Absolutely not.
It's been a long day. It's too long a day.
- Okay, darling. Have a good sleep.
- But I...
Do you know somewhere we could go?
I actually have the perfect place.
I can't believe you're really here.
I was taking an art course in Tuscany,
staying with a family outside Siena,
and they had a son Lorenzo,
and it was love at first sight.
He had such gentle blue eyes.
And he told me I was very beautiful.
And he gave me this ring.
We wanted to get married,
but I'd got exams back in England
and my parents would never have agreed,
and I got scared,
and I ran away.
Now
what I really want is to
tell him that I'm so sorry
I was such a coward.
Of course, a card or letter is just too simple.
So, you've come to find your Lorenzo?
Yes, and I think I know where he is.
Where?
On the farm, just near Siena.
Charlie's driving me down tomorrow.
Only because I didn't want you to hitchhike.
Well, he thinks it's a big mistake.
Because you don't have a
romantic bone in your body.
No, no. It's because I am a realist.
No. Because you are an Englishman!
Cold as fish!
Right. And who was it
that wrote Romeo and Juliet?
Williamo Shakespearelli, a great Italian.
They're mad. They're mad.
Sophie, my dear.
Good night. Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Good night. Good night, everybody.
- Good night.
- Charlie, let's go.
- Good night, ladies. Ciao.
- Good luck.
- Bye.
- Ciao.
How wonderful would it be
if she found her Romeo?
Imagine if she did, 50 years later,
all because you found that letter.
Nobody would believe it
if it weren't true, you know.
Wait! Wait!
- Oh, for... Here she comes.
- Sorry.
- May I come with you to find Lorenzo?
- Come with us?
What about this fiancé of yours?
You're in the city of love
and you want to come with us?
Yes, I do. Because he's busy and I'm free.
And I mean...
- Of course, if it's not an intrusion.
- No, no, it's not an intrusion.
I just... Listen,
- I do have one thing to tell you first.
- It's not an intrusion.
This is not entirely selfless.
It started out as a simple reply
to your letter,
and now I think it's so amazing
what you're doing,
- and I'd love to write about it if it's okay.
- A journalist.
Gran, a journalist trying
to pry into our private lives.
Charlie, come on.
It's hardly state secrets, is it?
I'm not a journalist.
I would like to be some day, but...
And you think Gran's story is your ticket?
I think it's a story worth telling.
I'd love to have you with us.
- Really?
- Yes. Of course.
We would.
How much time
did you actually spend with Lorenzo?
Every second that we could.
I'd go to meet him after class,
to the farm where he was working,
and we'd sit under the trees and we'd share
some bread with tomatoes and olive oil.
- It's so romantic.
- Yeah.
What's so romantic about eating in the dirt?
Really?
The dirt.
Well, you see, he loved the earth.
He loved talking to me about the rain
and the springs of fresh water,
and we'd walk for miles and miles.
We'd lie in the dry grass.
I can still remember
the smell of his sweet, hot sweat and...
Okay. Okay, Gran. We get the picture.
So you must feel like you're about
to find your long-lost soul mate.
Yes.
Her soul mate was my grandfather.
Let's not invalidate my entire existence.
Okay, I'm sorry, I just...
That's clearly not what I meant.
Charlie's just like my husband.
Both skeptics.
My husband always insisted
that love was nothing but hormones.
But you see, underneath,
he had such a warm, passionate heart.
And Charlie's just the same.
Tell me about the guy you're in love with.
Victor.
Yeah.
- Well, Victor is a chef, an amazing chef.
- Wow.
Yeah. He's opening his own
restaurant in New York.
And that's the reason we're here.
We're meeting suppliers all around.
And he's actually... He's in Livorno
at a wine auction as we speak.
That sounds fun.
For him. Yeah.
Well, and do your parents like him?
Yeah, my dad. My dad likes him.
My mom left us when I was nine.
Oh, dear.
- Oh, dear. I'm sorry about that.
- That's okay. It was a really long time ago.
Slowly, slowly.
How do you want to go about this?
Ring the doorbell.
What if the wife answers and
goes into a fit of jealous rage? Gran?
Well, I'd be flattered.
I'm more worried that
he won't remember me.
Right. Let's go home then, Gran,
before this all ends in tears.
Come on. There's no one in.
I'm gonna check the back.
There's no... We made our best effort.
There's no need to prolong
the disappointment.
It's me, yeah.
Good afternoon. I'm Charlie Wyman.
This is my grandmother, Claire,
- and Sophie.
- Ciao.
I'm Claire. Do you remember?
Claire.
It's not him.
Are you sure?
It's not his eyes.
Let's make sure.
Do you remember what you were doing
in the summer of 1957?
The summer of 1957, I will never forget,
I met the most beautiful girl
with long, blonde hair.
Nana!
We married that year.
- I curse that woman!
What?
- Oh, no!
- Right.
I curse her eyes! I curse her teeth!
I curse her mustache!
But why are you asking?
Why you bring up such a horrible memory?
Well, that went well.
Can't say we didn't try, Nana.
I'm sorry. Truly.
Are you for real?
If I actually knew what that question meant,
I might attempt to answer it.
He can't be the only Lorenzo Bartolini
in Tuscany.
Well, he's the only one around here, so...
I haven't flown all the way here
to pack it in now.
Nana, what do you want to do?
You want to start knocking on every door
asking if Lorenzo's in? I mean...
How many can there be?
Seventy-four?
Seventy-four Lorenzo Bartolinis and
you want to go on a scavenger hunt?
Impossible.
We're going home in the morning.
Come on, Charlie, will you calm down?
Sophie, what do you think?
Gran, what do you mean,
what does she think? She doesn't think.
This was her brilliant idea. It's over! Done!
We found Nemo.
The curtains have closed.
- Sophie.
- Listen, this is my job.
I find things.
And through process of elimination
and caveat emptor, which will require
assembling a few more facts,
we can narrow this down considerably.
Did Ms. Awesome For Real
just use caveat emptor?
Oh, please, all right. I went to Brown.
Double Major. Minor in Latin.
This is madness. It's madness.
Charlie, didn't you say
you wanted to go and swim?
- We are working. Go away.
- This is utter, complete mad...
Work!
I can't believe it.
Ridiculous.
He's a good-looking sort.
Isn't he?
All right. Are you... Are you sure that
Lorenzo would never have left this area?
He loved this land. I'm quite certain.
May I?
Our Lorenzos.
Are you sure that you have time for all this?
Ciao. How are you?
I'm good. How are you?
You know what?
I was just witnessing this most incredible,
incredible Sauterne auction.
It was just beautiful. It was incredible.
How's it going?
I'm good. I'm in Siena right now.
What? In Siena?
- What are you doing in Siena?
- I'm writing a story.
We're kind of on a bit of an adventure,
looking for somebody that
she used to know 50 years ago.
You know what, baby? You know what?
I mean, this isn't a good time because
I'm in the middle of something,
but, I mean, I'm glad you called because
I was actually just gonna call you right now.
You know, the opportunities here are really,
really, really incredible, you know,
and I think I'm gonna
have to stay till Friday.
Can I stay or should I skip it?
I mean, I feel horrible, but...
No, do it. Please.
I'm gonna need until Friday, as well.
Great. So Friday, all right? Friday.
Friday's good. Okay. Win-win.
Claire?
I'm free.
- Free for what? Free for what?
- She's coming.
- She's coming with us.
- She's coming? Splendid.
That's splendid! Fantastic!
- Okay?
- Okay.
Good luck.
It's not him.
Oh, my God. No!
Well, wouldn't this be nice, Gran?
Going from a boy who works the fields
to a man who owns them.
And you got to skip the messy bits.
Life is the messy bits.
Peccato it wasn't me.
Yes.
I would have never let you go.
Believe me.
What is it with you and Italian men?
They fall at your feet.
It's such a shame.
I think I could've been happy here.
Happy? Did your grandson just say happy?
I said could have been.
Let's not get carried away.
I have a reputation to uphold.
Charlie, why don't you tell Sophie
about your pro bono legal work?
I can't imagine she'd
have much interest, Gran.
- Try me.
- You know the sort of thing,
defending the defenseless, preserving
human rights, helping refugees get asylum.
- You look surprised.
- I'm so surprised.
I just didn't have you pinned down
as the save-humanity type at all.
Really?
And what type did you have me
pinned down for exactly?
Well, I was leaning towards
elitist Oxford prig,
but now that you mention it,
self-satisfied do-gooder works, as well.
I guess you're a poor judge
of character then.
But she does deal with facts, Charlie.
Okay.
- I'm off to bed.
- Okay.
- Good night, darling.
- Good night. Sleep well.
- May I walk you to your room?
- Be nice to each other.
She is awesome.
I respect your usage of the word
this one instance.
Oh, I'm flattered. Thank you for approving.
You're very welcome.
Right. Well. Should we hit the sack?
Sorry. I guess I...
Well, as much as I'd love to sit here
and drink the whole bottle of Caparzo...
No, go to bed. You should.
Good night, Charlie.
Right.
- Well, good night.
- Good night.
Forgive me. Where are my manners?
You know, I've been wondering that
since I met you.
Yes, well, I don't know what it is,
but you seem to bring out
the very worst in me.
- Somehow it's my fault.
- All of this is your fault.
You wrote that blasted letter.
Nonetheless, may I walk you to your room?
You know, I'm not the buttoned-up,
buttock-clenching killjoy
you try to make me out as.
Right. And I made you argue that
true love is bollocks.
Guilty.
It's just that I'm genuinely worried for her.
I know she may seem carefree,
but her life hasn't been all that simple.
Is it that unreasonable for me to worry?
No, but I have a really good feeling
about this. You'll see.
Let's hope you're right.
Signora Claire.
Signor Bartolini.
We're not done yet.
Of course we're not, darling.
Hello.
- Hello?
- Hello.
Hi. Is Claire with you? No?
No, no. She's turned in early, actually.
Okay.
I was gonna ask if you wanted dinner, but...
I just... I wanted to get started on my story.
How's it coming?
It's coming okay.
Am I in it?
- You may be. Why?
- Can I read just a little bit?
- Are you kidding me?
- Come on, just a little bit.
Absolutely not.
How am I to be sure that
I'm being properly portrayed?
No, you are. Believe me. You are.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means good night, Charlie.
- Good night.
- Okay.
Yeah.
Good night.
- What? Okay.
- Is this
one of those situations
where you're really saying the opposite
of what you actually mean?
No.
Right.
Good night then.
Good night, Charlie.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Gran wants to sleep in this morning.
Is she okay?
I mean, does she need anything?
No need.
She's tough as old boots, that one.
Churchill in a dress.
So, I thought I'd see a bit of Siena
since we're here.
It's a good idea.
I suppose you want to keep on writing.
I mean...
Work, work, work.
Admirable trait.
Right, of course. Carry on then.
Charlie?
Since we're here...
I hate to compliment you, but what
you're doing for Claire is really...
It's sweet, and I...
I imagine that you'd rather be spending
your holiday elsewhere,
so did you volunteer your services, or did
your parents? I mean, where do they fit in?
I'd like to think they're someplace nice.
They were killed in a car accident
when I was 10.
I'm sorry.
God, I'm sorry.
Thank you, Sophie. I appreciate it.
It was a difficult time.
Gran lost her son.
I lost my parents.
I'm not a big believer in
happy endings, I'm afraid.
Anyway, Gran stepped in. Took an angry,
obnoxious, young boy under her wing
and made me the simply
unpleasant man I am today.
So, isn't your fiancé
starting to get just a tad lonely?
You know, Victor's having
the time of his life right now.
And I doubt he even notices that I'm gone.
What about you?
- Don't you have a girlfriend?
- That is a very, very long story.
Yeah? I'm not surprised.
It's been about a year
since I've seen Patricia.
And you broke up with her?
Are you insinuating that I'm more the type
to be dumped rather than do the dumping?
Maybe I am.
Actually, I did break up with Patricia.
This time.
Okay, that's enough.
All right. That's enough.
- Sophie...
- That's enough.
- Your writing is really good.
- Thank you.
No. It's really, really, really good.
Why are you so surprised?
How come you've never shown
your work to anyone?
- I never feel like it's finished.
- Why?
Because I guess I'm a perfectionist.
You know that's just another way
of saying "I'm a chicken"?
Listen. You've got nothing to be afraid of.
You're not a fact checker. You're a writer.
- What was that for?
- I'm not a chicken.
And I'm not a gentleman.
Do you think we should get back to Claire?
Yeah. Many more Lorenzos.
Okay.
We should get back to Claire.
I am Lorenzo Bartolini!
Take him! Take him!
I am Lorenzo Bartolini!
I am Lorenzo Bartolini!
Wow.
I am Lorenzo Bartolini!
Do you know what you are?
You are the Montagues and the Capulets.
You mean... Well, at least I'm not Romeo.
- That's the understatement of the century.
- No, no, no, because you see,
if I found the love of my life,
I wouldn't stand there like an idiot
whispering in a garden.
I would just grab her from that
blasted balcony and be done with it.
Do you believe in destiny?
Do you?
Yeah, I think so.
I think it's destiny that I'm here, right now.
With Claire.
Of course. Of course. With Claire.
Well, this is the street.
Well, there's 2. Here's number 2.
This is what I feared the most.
- Charlie, we don't even know if it's him.
- I hope it's not. I hope it's not.
- Either way, we're finished. We're done.
- No. Not here.
When do we stop?
Over the next hill? Or the next?
Scour the whole country?
No. No. It ends here.
There are other Lorenzos
not too far away from here.
It's not the ending you want, is it?
This isn't just a clever story
- with a clever ending.
- Stop it, Charlie.
- It's our life. It's my Gran's life.
- It's not about...
Charlie, it's not about a story.
No, no, no, she's already lost the man once.
How many more times
would you have her lose him?
You know what?
I don't expect you to understand any of this
because you don't know a thing
about real loss.
Yeah.
You're wrong.
Sophie's mother ran away from her
when she was a little girl.
It's different, Gran. It's different.
You're right.
But
Sophie's mother chose to leave her.
And you always knew your
mum and dad loved you.
Come in.
Hi.
Oh, dear.
I just wanted to see if you were all right.
I'm okay.
Claire, I'm so sorry if I caused you...
No.
Every minute has been so special.
Darling.
May I?
One of the great joys in life
is having one's hair brushed.
Charlie, say you're sorry.
In the eye, Charlie. With contrition.
Sophie...
- Thank you.
... I'm afraid I...
In the eye.
Yes, Gran, I'm not 12.
Prove it.
I'm sincerely sorry, Sophie.
It won't happen again.
Excellent.
Sophie,
- I want to make a toast.
- Thank you.
I want to thank you for the wonderful thing
you did for a complete stranger.
I'll never forget it.
Nor I.
I've had the most incredible
few days. I really have,
and I can't thank you enough
for letting me tag along.
I think you did more than tag along.
Here is to all our loved ones,
wherever they may be.
May I join you?
Please.
I am sorry, Sophie.
I used to lay out under the stars as a kid,
in the summertime.
"Doubt thou the stars are fire"
"Doubt that the sun doth move"
"Doubt truth be a liar"
"But never doubt I love"
Do you think he's out there? Lorenzo?
Yeah.
He's somewhere.
And am I wrong? To insist she quit?
No, you know,
you can't go on forever.
At some point, you have to stop.
Then why is it that
I feel like a schoolboy on Sunday?
It's nearly tomorrow and I don't want to go.
Me, either.
And I always liked school.
- Morning.
- Morning.
Thank you.
How'd you sleep?
I slept fine. How about you?
Yes. Great. Thanks.
Good morning.
Good morning.
- How are you?
- Good morning, my darling.
It's a beautiful day.
Sophie, would you mind going in the front?
Because I'd love to stretch my legs for a bit.
Okay.
Fantastic, darling.
The stars were spectacular
from my window.
Look. That vineyard.
That's our favorite wine.
Let's turn in there and
have a goodbye toast.
Okay.
Charlie, stop!
Nana, what is it?
It's Lorenzo.
Who?
The boy?
All right, Nana. Let's get you
in the shade. Shall we?
I am Lorenzo Bartolini.
Sophie. I think this is...
- Do you know a Lorenzo Bartolini?
- I asked him and...
- I am Lorenzo Bartolini.
- You are!
Oh, my... Sophie, he's the grandson!
- Can I help you?
- Yes.
We're looking for a Lorenzo Bartolini.
I am Lorenzo Bartolini.
- He's Lorenzo, too.
- Do you have a father also named Lorenzo?
Yes, he went out riding.
But what can I do for you?
I'm sorry. We're being terribly rude.
- I'm Charlie Wyman.
- I'm Sophie.
Lorenzo.
Lorenzo.
We have been on quite a journey
for your father.
You see,
my grandmother, Claire, knows him.
Charlie. Charlie, let's go!
Let's go!
All right.
Nana, Nana, Nana, Lorenzo is here.
He's out riding, but he's
going to be back any minute.
Well, then, let's go before he comes back.
Nana, we've come all this way.
- Come on.
- I've been ridiculous.
I've been completely ridiculous.
He knew me when I was 15 years old, a girl.
That girl's gone.
Oh, my God.
Claire?
Yes.
So many years.
Yes, 50.
If you allow me.
I really don't know how to express myself.
Well, I went for a ride
this morning as an old man,
and I came back as a teenager again.
I'm so very happy you all meet Claire
and her grandson, Charlie,
and their lovely friend, Sophie.
My dear Claire,
you have told me you lost your Jack.
- And you know I lost my Rosa.
- Yeah.
But destiny wanted us to meet again.
Health to the Bartolini family.
To the Bartolinis.
I'm sorry I was late.
No.
When we are speaking about love,
it's never too late.
Well, bad luck, eh?
All hope lost and he rides in
at the last moment on a white horse.
No one will believe it.
Promise me...
Promise me you'll finish the story.
I guess this is it.
And I'm sorry it is.
Yeah, me, too.
Sophie, I...
I never should've kissed you.
I was completely out of bounds.
Mmm.
You're engaged and...
It's time to go.
Goodbye, Charlie.
I'll miss you.
Hi. It is time to...
I must get back to Victor. Sorry.
Yes. Of course.
So, where's Charlie?
We'll give you a drive there straight away.
No, I'm...
Claire, I can't take you away
from this place, so...
My son can drive you.
- Just a moment.
- Yes. Grazie.
I'm so happy for you.
Is something wrong?
No! No.
No. It's just, you know...
And you're leaving?
An angel brought you to me.
Thank you.
Thank you. I'll be eternally grateful.
Thank you.
It's very kind. Thank you.
Thank you so much.
- You're always welcome here.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Lorenzo.
- Ciao.
Speak soon.
Bye.
Darling, you're family,
so I think you'll understand
why I'm telling you you're a total idiot.
Okay, okay, then don't sugarcoat it, Gran.
I won't.
How many Sophies do you think
there are on this planet?
Don't wait 50 years like I did.
Go. Go! Go!
I missed you so much! So much.
...in person because I couldn't
send you an e-mail,
Because it was... It just didn't make sense,
because I know you were having...
One second.
Hello? Hey. Yeah, yeah.
We just have to sort out all the deliveries
that we need to make. I mean...
What happened?
You don't like the ending?
No, the ending's fine.
It's actually quite moving.
But what happened to the people?
I mean, are they still together?
What about... What about the kid?
What about Charlie? Where's he?
I don't know. I didn't keep in touch.
Do you have any advice?
I think you should buy stock in Alitalia,
'cause all the ladies are gonna
be flocking to Verona.
Are you gonna publish this?
Yeah, I'm gonna publish it.
It's a good story.
You got anything else for me?
No, not at the moment.
Oh, my God.
You said Tuscan gold, right? Tuscan gold?
Look. This is yellow.
Yellow. Tuscan gold. Yellow.
I mean, there's no Tuscany, there's no gold.
- It's just like Limoncello, you know.
- Sure.
- Yeah? Can we do it again?
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah? All right, all right, all right.
- Let's go. Come on.
Let's try it again.
Hey, Sophie.
- Hi.
Hey, how's your day been?
- I showed my story to Bobby.
- Did he like it?
Yeah, he's gonna print it.
- Print it?
- Yeah.
Wow! Wow. That's pretty great, huh?
- I know. Did you read it?
- Yeah, yeah.
- No. I...
- Last night I left it out for you to read.
I don't need to.
I mean, I know it's gonna be great.
Plus, I'm gonna see it...
I'm gonna see it when it comes out.
That's why I prefer to buy it.
- You know, I'm surprised, like...
- Yeah.
- You know? Like...
Watch out! Watch out!
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
- Thanks for lunch.
- Oh, my God. You so deserve this.
I want to be your fact checker for life.
Don't ever think about going
anywhere else, ever. Ever.
I promise.
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.
Sophie, these messages are for you.
Oh!
- And a letter came for you.
- Thank you.

- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hey!
Hi.
Can't believe you're here.
You look beautiful.
When did you get in?
Where are you staying?
I haven't figured that out yet.
Well, no need. You'll stay here.
Lorenzo wouldn't have it any other way.
I hope so. How is...
How's our great Lorenzo?
Is he as amazing as ever?
- Even more so.
- Yeah?
- Actually, I wanna just...
There you are!
I think we're ready in there,
and she'll be here any second.
Sophie, this is Patricia.
Hi.
The Sophie?
The Sophie.
It is so nice to finally meet you.
- Well, I'll see you inside.
- Okay.
- Don't trip.
- As if I'm not nervous enough.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Okay.
- It's great to see you.
- I'm gonna go in. I will...
- I'II... I'll see you after, okay?
- Okay. Yep.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi, Sophie.
- I'm so happy to see you.
- How are you? How are you?
- I'm happy to see you.
Beautiful. Beautiful.
Boy!
- We're here.
- It's amazing.
I just want to say thank you
on behalf of myself and my lovely wife,
la mia bella Claire!
And now it's your turn.
- Well...
- Go on.
Dear friends,
50 years ago, I went to
Juliet's house in Verona.
I wrote her a letter
and I asked her a question.
And two months ago, I received a reply.
And without that letter,
none of us would be here today.
Sophie, would you mind if I read
out the words you wrote to me?
All right?
"Dear Claire, 'what' and 'if'
are two words as non-threatening
as words can be.
But put them together, side by side,
and they have the power
to haunt you for the rest of your life.
What if?
What if?
What if?
I don't know how your story ended,
but if what you felt then was true love
then it's never too late.
If it was true then,
why wouldn't it be true now?
You need only the courage
to follow your heart.
I don't know what a love
like Juliet's feels like,
a love to leave loved ones for,
a love to cross oceans for,
but I'd like to believe,
if I ever were to feel it,
that I'd have the courage to seize it.
And, Claire, if you didn't,
I hope one day that you will.
All my love,
Juliet"
I'll be right back, all right, Gran?
Sophie?
Sophie?
Sophie?
Of course!
- A balcony.
- Well.
What are you doing up there?
I'm gonna go.
Why?
Because this is really painful.
I should have realized sooner, but I didn't,
or I guess maybe I couldn't,
but Victor and I aren't together anymore.
- And I guess I came back hoping that...
- Wait, wait. You're not engaged?
No.
But it's too late.
It's clearly too late.
And it really doesn't matter anymore
because, honestly,
I love you.
I can't believe I just said that.
But I do, I love you. It doesn't...
I mean, it shouldn't matter to you,
- because you're here with Patricia.
- Patricia?
And you should be back with her right now.
Patricia is my cousin. She's my cousin.
- How is that legal?
- No...
Sophie... No.
No, no, no. Let me explain!
Sophie, I'm so stupid. There's two Patricias.
There's my cousin, who's here,
and the one that I've
completely forgotten about.
More importantly, there's only one Sophie.
Now, would you please come down?
Wait, Charlie. Charlie, stop.
What are you doing?
Charlie, what are you doing?
Listen to me.
Listen to me very, very carefully.
I live in London, a gorgeous, vibrant,
historic city that I happen to love living in.
You live in New York,
which is highly overrated.
Pardon me?
But since the Atlantic Ocean
is a bit wide to cross every day,
swimming, boating or flying,
I suggest we flip for it.
What are you saying?
And if those terms are unacceptable,
leaving London will be a pleasure,
as long as you're waiting for me
on the other side.
'Cause the truth is, Sophie,
I am madly, deeply, truly,
passionately in love with you.
You are?
I am.
- Are you gonna kiss me?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, my God!
Charlie!
I can't believe I just did that.
Hi.
Are you okay?
Please tell me no one saw that.
Nobody saw it.
Good. That's good.
Can you move?
Only my lips.
