{\i1}Now for a few words from Sister Sarah.{\i}
Excuse me a moment,
please, Sister Sarah
Won't you say something
for our newsreel audience?
They're all interested to know
just how you feel.
I should like to say a few words
about the late Barton Jonesworth.
Feel perfectly free to do so.
When he came to see me
six years ago, he said-quote-
I do not believe in charity, I'm
a  business man -unquote-
So I said to Mr. Jonesworth
{\i1}that I would never ask him
for a donation,{\i}
{\i1}not even a dime. However,{\i}
{\i1}if he wanted to sell something,
I'd be glad to talk business.{\i}
These automobiles,
{\i1}I paid Mr.Jonesworth the total
sum of 25 cents.{\i}
For this fur I'm wearing,
40 cents.
And this priceless
necklace, 60 cents.
And finally this magnificent mansion,
this 70 acre estate,
the price asked was 1 $.
Not a cent more.
think this all proves something.
{\i1}While Mr. Jonesworth said he did
not believe in charity,{\i}
as a business man,
he was very, very generous.
Hello.
Hello.
What can I do for you?
I wanna see Sister Sarah.
What about?
I wanna make a donation.
Sister Sarah!
What is it, my child ?
Thank you, Sister Sarah.
Thank you so much.
Tell me...
Did you have lunch?
Well, you're going to have
lunch with me.
And dinner too.
Come along!
Come along!
How did you make out?
- Piece of cake.
- I told you that girl could handle it.
Lord! Some castle she's got there!
- I got tired counting the rooms.
- What's the lay out?
Looks good.
There's only one hitch.
You'll have to time it
from the first second.
You'll have exactly 15 minutes.
What do you mean, 15 minutes?
What's the 30 minute business?
We got talking about this and that and
she told me she's crazy about John Facenda.
John Facenda?
You know, that TV reporter,
he's on every night.
11 o'clock, for 15 minutes.
She watches John Facenda
and he's on for 15 minutes. So what?
- The TV set is downstairs and...
- Will you get to it?
Where is she keeping it?
In her room.
In a wall safe.
I don't know.
There ain't much time.
Especially not on this one,
our first big job.
Thirty seconds.
Will you cut it out?
- What?
- You're breathing on my neck.
Twenty seconds.
Eighteen.
Check the light.
Ten seconds, Mr. Facenda.
Settle down, boys.
Standby please.
Russia said today that it rejected
an offer of U.S. farm surplus
because America refuses to include
any strategic goods in the deal.
The official Soviet news agency
said the treaty was annulled by the U.S.
several years ago
{\i1}and accused the U.S. of erecting
international trade barriers.{\i}
{\i1}Western statesmen were pleased with
the construction progress of the unified{\i}
{\i1}of the air screen across Western
Europe, from Norway to Turkey.{\i}
{\i1}The NATO defense ministers predicted
that a jam-proof communication warning{\i}
{\i1}network will be completed
early next year.{\i}
Come on, let's go. I am tired,
I wanna check in.
Isn't that strange?
- Why is that car parked here?
- There's no law against parking here.
Yeah, yeah, I know,
I know.
Let's stick around a while.
- The necklace!
- You got it?
Not yet.
Wait here.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
{\i1}Philadelphia,{\i}
{\i1}A love-sick boy was
fatally wounded today{\i}
{\i1}in a gun battle with 35 policemen.{\i}
{\i1}They caught in a woodland hideout
in Belmont Park where he had fled{\i}
{\i1}after killing his sweetheart
and three members of her family.{\i}
Is this your car?
Yeah but I sure wish
it wasn't, officer.
- What're you doing out here?
- Know where there's an all-night mechanic?
- What's wrong.
- Stalled on me, won't start.
- Let's see your card.
- Yeah.
I must have walked 3 miles.
Nothing!
Not one gas station open.
They close up  early round here.
Know what time it is?
If it's the battery,
you could need a push.
No, it isn't the battery.
She turns over all right.
I don't know what it is.
Will you let me try?
- How are the cards?
- They're in order.
Some nights, a man shouldn't go out.
That all depends on what he's out for.
How many drinks you have?
Not a drop.
I never touch it.
Don't let it get away!
Look...
What's your line of work?
- The selling business.
- Door to door?
- Yeah.
- How is business?
I break even. You know how it is,
it's a struggle.
What ain't?
What're you gonna do now?
Climb in the back and go to sleep.
Unless you want to drive me home.
Does it look like a taxi?
Come on, we should go.
{\i1}Art least one indictment may be
returned by the Grand Jury{\i}
{\i1}investigating the million dollar
tax case of Roget T. Lee.{\i}
{\i1}The Grand Jury has been sitting in Special
Session inquiring why the industrialist{\i}
{\i1}has been able to evade paying
income tax for six years.{\i}
One minute 26 seconds.
25 seconds.
24 seconds.
- 23...
- Why do count? Think he can hear you?
{\i1}Have a nice night
and a good day tomorrow.{\i}
Good night all.
Come on.
Nat...
How did it go?
O.K.
- Vic.
- Nerves.
You don't look so good yourself.
- It's all right.
- You want a drink?
- I'd choke on it.
- A coffee.
Not for me, nothing.
I just wanna sit here.
You, Nat?
Nat...
Nat...
I'm talking to you.
You want some coffee?
Yeah.
What's it read?
You're in the light.
Let's have it!
What's the story?
Get out of the light.
Move, how can I see what I'm doing?
Merchandise, Nat.
Very expensive merchandise.
- How much?
- You really made a hole.
Remarkable piece of property here.
All right, all right.
What's  the figure?
One and a half.
What?
That high?
A hundred and fifty thou.
That's the store price.
How much can we get for it?
From a fence?
Around 80, 85.
What are you talking about?
It's more than 50% off.
All right, you sell it.
Take it to Tiffany's.
It's worth 150, we sell it 85 grand,
we're giving it away.
You'll be getting 20 000.
That buys a lot of lunches.
We ought to get more than 80.
Here, feel it.
Watch out!
You'd burn your fingers.
You got that?
It's hot, Dohmer.
Scorching hot.
A fence gets hold of this,
right away he's gonna be worried.
Right away, he'll start thinking
about to get rid of it.
The setting is platinum,
it's got to be melted down.
The stones have to be cut, recut,
maybe cut again.
Not by no second-rater.
You need a high-grade engineer,
special talent.
You don't buy that with peanuts.
Some day, I'll teach you
the jewelery business.
Better get busy right away,
there's a fence I know in Baltimore.
Call him, make it fast.
The sooner we get this off our hands...
No, no phone calls.
No wires, no letters,
not even in code, nothing.
Why not?
This trinket need a mug.
We gotta turn it into cash.
Relax!
Cool yourself.
Why the slow motion?
What are we waiting for?
A drop in the temperature.
You think that's hot?
It's hotter out there,
boiling hot.
The law, Baylock, the local
authorities, the blue boys,
What do you think they're doing:
sleeping?
Tell me,
have you had any visitors,
any strangers, doorbell ringers?
What are you getting at?
Did you invite them in,
show them through the mansion?
Sure, I did. When you live in a place
like this,
you want people to see it,
want them to have a look.
One of them had a good look.
- You don't mean...
- Yes, I do, madam.
This mansion was cased. It was
thoroughly and efficiently cased.
{\i1}You hear it boiling?
You turn it off.{\i}
The mistake was so obvious,
I can't understand it.
A fundamental error
in criminal technique.
I don't follow.
What did he do?
He let them see his face.
Almost as if he wants
to get caught.
You're out of your head?
We can't just sit here with this thing.
When things cool off out there,
we'll be ready to move.
I wanna move now.
I want to have my split and take off.
Nat, can't you see it my way?
No.
You want to get off that track?
We all got to move on one way.
We're an organization,
try to remember that.
Forget me? Forget that I have a 30
year rap staring me in the face?
Can't you see my only move?
I've got to take a stroll.
I've got to start
to clear out of this country.
The quicker I get started,
the better chance I have.
I've always wanted that chance.
Hoped for it, dreamed about it.
The one juicy hole that'd put
the money in my pocket.
the money that takes me on
a long, long trip
in Central America.
I'd stay there.
I'd have what it needs to stay there.
20 000 George Washington.
20 000
Enough to buy some ground,
grow something.
Bananas.
Anything.
For years, I've had that here.
Pictures.
Lots o' pictures.
All deeming with transportation.
It begins at the travel agency
buying the ticket.
Then I go to the airport.
And I'm walking through the gate.
And there she is
waiting for me.
A big, fat, beautiful job.
With four engines,
eighty passengers.
And I'm one of them.
We taxi across the field,
get ready to take off.
And we pick up speed,
faster, faster.
Next thing, I'm going up.
Up, I'm up there.
I'm off the ground.
Going up, higher, higher.
We're heading South, far South.
Going South you'll get to South
Philadelphia. Reed Street.
They call it Moyamemsing Prison.
{\i1}Sorry, captain, there doesn't
seem to be anything here.{\i}
Nothing?
- George!
- Yeah!
Find more photograph, George.
Bring in those files
we received from Oregon,
Arizona and those from the FBI.
What a dope!
45 dollars a month!
They sure take advantage
of us tourists.
- Where's Gladden?
- In the kitchen.
Yes, she's in the kitchen. You know
why she's in the kitchen?
So you can't look at her.
You're always looking at her.
What am I supposed to do?
Look at you?
More on the temple.
Yes, right there.
That's it.
Now, the chin.
Can you shorten up on the chin?
You know, that lip,
the bottom one was thinner.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
Looks good to me.
No, we're giving it a try,
it's the only angle we have.
Yes, I'll give you a call as soon as
we get it. If we get it.
- How is it shaping up?
- Coming closer.
Nat...
Want a sandwich or something?
- Maybe later.
- We got some chicken in the icebox.
How about a chicken sandwich
on rye bread?
Thanks but I'm not hungry.
You should be, you had no dinner,
you gotta eat.
This will do for now.
Stop it!
Stop what?
You know why. Don't put the look
as though you don't know.
What am I doing?
You're looking at me.
You're always looking at me.
So what?
What's wrong with that?
Why shouldn't I?
- Cool!
- I'll scratch your eyes.
Cool!
Lay off!
Leave her alone.
Why don't you grow up?
You stay out of it.
You're over 21,
you act like 12.
Will you do me a favor?
Sure.
Climb into bed, go to sleep
and don't wake up.
- Why don't you let her drip?
- No, I've got something to talk about.
You don't have to talk to me like that.
I won't let you.
- If you open your mouth again...
- You used rotten talk yourself.
I was trying to give you advice
but you're too stubborn...
I'd rather hear cats yelling in the night.
Now move out of this kitchen.
- You'll listen what I have to say.
- I told you to get out.
- Put that thing down immediately.
- Are you going to leave me alone?
I dare you to throw the pot.
Get out!
Get out!
Get out!
I don't get it.
Tell me one thing:
what do you need her for?
She knows the job,
she knows how to case a layout.
But you know she's no expert at it.
I know hundreds
that can operate better.
I know that ain't the reason.
Another I know for sure,
it ain't as if you had got eyes for her.
If you were sweet on her,
I could understand, but you aren't.
You hardly even look at her.
You don't even know she's around.
What is it, Nat?
Why can't you let her go?
We're an organization.
- She's a chartered member.
- He's going at it again.
Why are you holding on to her?
Why don't you let her go.
There's got to be a reason.
Perfect! That's him all right.
Printing office.
Please hurry.
Keebler here.
Can you send an operator right away?
I've got a pencil drawing of a man's face.
I need a thousand copies.
This is going out to 15 states.
{\i1}It happened a long time ago,{\i}
{\i1}Just another orphan in an orphanage.{\i}
You didn't like that high gate.
{\i1}One day, you climbed over
and you got away.{\i}
{\i1}They wouldn't stop.
They didn't even look at you.{\i}
{\i1}It made you feel lonesome,
not wanted.{\i}
Come on, kid, hop in!
{\i1}And that was the start of it,
that day when he picked you up.{\i}
{\i1}That day on you had a home.{\i}
{\i1}and a father.{\i}
{\i1}You'll never forget his face.{\i}
{\i1}That's him,{\i}
{\i1}that's Gerald.{\i}
{\i1}And the little girl,{\i}
{\i1}that's Gladden.{\i}
{\i1}he put food in your belly.{\i}
{\i1}He put clothes on your back,{\i}
{\i1}a roof over your head.{\i}
{\i1}He was good to you.{\i}
{\i1}He was kind.{\i}
{\i1}So kind.{\i}
{\i1}You'll never forget his voice,
that soft voice.{\i}
{\i1}You could hardly believe it
when you found out.{\i}
{\i1}You asked him what kind of work
he did and he answered:{\i}
{\i1}I break in the places, I steal.{\i}
{\i1}I'm a burglar.{\i}
{\i1}But no gun, he never used a gun,
no weapon at all.{\i}
{\i1}That was the first thing he taught you,
you do it clean.{\i}
{\i1}And that night,{\i}
{\i1}he took you out on your first job.{\i}
{\i1}He also asked you to make a promise,
to give your word of honor.{\i}
{\i1}if anything ever happened to him,
you'd take care of her.{\i}
Your word of honor.
{\i1}You promised.{\i}
{\i1}You gave your word.{\i}
{\i1}3 years later, something went wrong,
it was your fault, your first mistake.{\i}
Stop!
I'm warning you, I'll shoot.
{\i1}You ran, you ran like a rabbit.{\i}
{\i1}Gladden, Gladden, Gladden.{\i}
Nat...
Why aren't you asleep?
- I can't sleep.
- Why not?
I don't know.
I can't close my eyes.
What about you?
- Gladden.
- Yes, Nat.
I've been thinking.
You need a change.
You ought to go away for a while.
Thank you.
Thanks a lot.
Don't get me wrong.
If you want me out of the way,
I'll step out of the way.
Will you quit twisting it around?
- All I said was...
- Stop, Nat. Don't make it worse.
You'll only get yourself in deeper.
You know, Nat.
I'll do anything.
Anything you say.
After all, you're in charge.
- You're the baby sitter.
- Quit that talk.
You're the legal guardian, the foster father.
- I don't want to hear it.
- Why not?
Unless you'd rather not see it that way.
- Please, let me explain.
- It's not necessary.
Listen to me.
It's Dohmer, he won't leave you alone.
And you're always fighting with Baylock.
- I can handle them.
- I don't know.
They're getting jittery.
Besides,
it would be good for you.
You're pale.
It'd be good for your health.
- There's nothing wrong with my health.
- Let's not argue.
I'm not arguing.
That trip I'm taking...
Where do you want me to go?
Doesn't matter.
New York, Boston.
They're not exactly healthy.
You said I'm going for my health.
- What about the seashore? Wildwood?
- It doesn't make any difference.
- Atlantic City, is that all right?
- Yes, sure, it's all right.
You'll have salty air, sunshine.
You can go to the beach, go swimming.
O.K, O.k. When do I leave?
No use waiting.
I'll start packing now.
I didn't say that.
You don't have to rush it.
Don't I?
I'll leave first thing in the morning.
I'll take you to the station.
{\i1}The Atlantic city Express will leave
at 7:15, Stairway number 8.{\i}
Nat...
When are we going to do something?
I want to get busy.
Why don't weave a rug for your head?
Look... I say we move,
you say we wait.
That makes it an issue.
I need to talk.
All right, let's talk.
Let's it kick it around a bit
and see what happens.
Come to this, if I'm staying,
I got to get moving.
I need traveling, I need it bad.
Nat, please let me go to Baltimore.
I'll get a quick transaction.
We'll make ourselves some finance.
Then we'll split the cash
and I can take off.
What for?
You're comfortable here.
If you stay put,
you'll stay comfortable.
I don't feel it that way.
What I've got to do is travel.
And I don't mean no 40 mile bus ride.
The place I've got in mind,
Central America.
All right! Let it be Central America
but that comes later.
- It's got to be now.
- Later, Baylock, later.
Later! You say that as if it was
just a matter of killing time.
Look, Nat, I'm on probation.
I can't afford on another
For you, it's different,
you've never been in,
never booked, never printed,
never mugged.
See the way it is: you can walk away,
I'm on a tightrope.
My name is Della.
I said my name is Della.
- What goes on here?
- A situation.
You do this all the time?
No, of course not.
You know I've never done it before.
- How would I know?
- You just know, that's all.
You're looking at me and you know.
What's your name?
Nathaniel.
Say, what is this?
What do you want?
Basically?
Basically, I'm out
to find myself a man.
Wait for me outside.
- Are you kidding?
- No.
No, Nathaniel, I'm not kidding.
Well... It's tough on you.
Sorry!
No sale.
Just to let you know
I'm not selling anything.
Nathaniel.
Nathaniel.
Nat.
You know,
I like the feel of that name.
Nat.
It's soft but it has a slap sound.
Not like another name.???
Later tonight,
I'll be home.
No need to ring the bell,
the door will be open.
A light?
That's three.
Three what?
Three drinks in the last half hour.
Tell me something.
Who hurt you?
Answer me, Della.
You sure hauled that in
from left field.
Come on, let's have it.
What's the point?
You've heard it before.
The same sob story.
All right. If you'd rather skip it.
No, Nat.
I'll tell you.
You asked me so
I'll tell you.
Well, it goes like this:
A girl comes from a wonderful family.
Really wonderful!
The old man's a
no good loafer.
The mother drinks bootleg whiskey,
50 cents a pint.
when she can't steal it
Where was this?
Youngstown, Ohio.
I had four brothers,
three sisters.
We were a very close family.
We had to be close,
we lived in two rooms.
When did you pull out?
When I was 17.
I went to Chicago.
A great city, Chicago!
The city of opportunity.
The first three, I turned down.
Along comes Sir Galahad
to the rescue.
Turns out he ran a model agency.
At least, that's what he called it.
Next thing I know there's a
bunch of creeps with cameras.
Somehow I
ended in show-business.
I was a dancer.
What's known as a high kick.
One night, I
I kicked the booking agent
right in the mouth.
I broke his jaw.
And then, it happened.
I met an eligible bachelor.
A nice guy.
Real nice.
So completely different from
all the others.
So clean.
I married him.
I was happy.
I was so happy
I couldn't believe it.
Then comes the left hook,
right between the eyes.
He took off?
Jet propelled.
Why? What did it?
A photograph.
A damn joker showed him
a photograph of me.
Very special.
From the model agency.
He didn't even bother to hit me.
His name was Gerald.
He had a daughter, Gladden.
Gladden?
It's a strange name for a girl.
She was a strange kid.
Always so quiet.
Lonely.
- Bewildered.
- Tell me more about Gerald.
He brought me up.
He was a father to me.
He taught me everything I know.
- You feel obligated?
- It runs deeper than that.
Much deeper.
One thing he drilled into me.
You make a promise,
you gotta keep it.
I gave my word
I'd always take care of Gladden.
You know,
it's sort of weird.
A lot of things come back to me.
Like the time I wanted
to pull out of that bargain,
get a job,
be legitimate.
What stopped you?
I don't know.
I've never been able to figure it out.
Like something inside me,
steering me.
Gerald.
Della!
Della!
Della!
{\i1}You don't get it from him,{\i}
I'll get it from that little
blond doll in Atlantic City.
We'd better be getting back.
We have work to do.
We'll get the necklace, baby.
- I need some inspiration.
- Later.
Let's save that for later.
Competition!
Business rivals.
I knew this would happen.
This is what we get for waiting around.
We should have made a bargain
days ago.
Nat, it's not too late.
We go to Baltimore now,
I'll contact that fence.
No!
- What do you mean, "no"?
- We're going to Atlantic City.
For what? Are you crazy?
What do we need her for?
You don't get that point:
she needs us.
It's for us.
I'll see your papers.
Do you know what you were doing?
I was under 50.
Yeah, but you were on the left side
of that white line over there.
I'm sorry, officer.
I guess I was dreaming.
Don't let it turn into a nightmare.
- Stay on the right side.
- Thank you, officer. I will.
{\i1}Three white men in a light gray,
four-door Chevrolet.{\i}
{\i1}51 model, Pennsylvania
1 M Mary Z Zebra 70{\i}
Cut off the ignition
and get out of the car.
Hey, Steve!
I always thought you were a moron,
now I know it.
Full in the face!
Why not the arm or shoulder?
Save it!
He can't hear you.
{\i1}The above men made their escape
in a 1951 light gray Chevrolet.{\i}
{\i1}Pennsylvania 1 M Mary Z Zebra 70{\i}
{\i1}Last seen at the Black Horse Pike,
in Hammonton.{\i}
{\i1}Caution, they are armed and dangerous.{\i}
Where are we at now?
Take a whiff.
- So?
- From the ocean.
- Let's go!
- What about the car? We'll need it.
What for? So that they'll see it again?
It's number one on their list.
Come on!
Where did that gun battle take place?
Black Horse Pike,
31 miles from here.
One mile this side of Hammonton.
Here, right here.
I guess you know about the trooper.
Got him in the face.
Died immediately.
The other trooper emptied his revolver
at them, chased them, lost them,
radioed headquarters. They got on
right away to make roadblocks.
One here,
here,
about here on this road.
- What's your guess?
- I'm guessing. Calculating.
See that tiny intersection right here?
Three miles up the road,
you come into the first roadblock.
It's obvious. There's only one turn
at this intersection, a right-hand one.
Another turn there.
Another one there.
No more roads.
They're somewhere in the woods.
How can they drive through the woods?
- There are paths there.
- Very slow.
Put yourself in his place.
He's gotta keep moving,
he can't turn back.
Finally the woods get too thick,
no more paths.
So what you do is abandon the car
{\i1}and walk through the woods.{\i}
{\i1}to this point right here.
Marshland.{\i}
{\i1}The bay area.{\i}
{\i1}In the distance you see Atlantic City,
playground of the world.{\i}
{\i1}Huge crowds, coming
from every state in the Union.{\i}
{\i1}This man I'm looking for
is a professional.{\i}
{\i1}Extremely intelligent.{\i}
{\i1}He knows that his best hiding place
is in a crowded area.{\i}
{\i1}Where he is surrounded by other persons.{\i}
This looks o.k.
Wait here for me,
I'll be back.
Where're you going?
Gladden.
Hello.
I'm calling from downstairs.
Don't talk, I'll do the talking.
I've got to see you.
Well, get rid of him.
I don't care what you tell him,
just get rid of him.
And wait there for me,
I'll be up in a few minutes.
Yes.
You'd better go now.
Pack your things, you're checking out.
Why? What's happening?
Complications.
Come on, we gotta move.
Me... I like it here.
There is sunshine,
all that salty air.
Good for my health.
That's why you sent me here,
remember?
For my health.
What are you getting at?
I'm feeling very happy these days.
His name is Charlie.
Charlie!
Yes, Charlie.
That's his name, Charlie.
Really?
Tell me about him.
He likes me.
He likes me very much.
Very very much.
It's a good thing you're sitting down
because you're going to hear something.
Your boy friend is a cop.
He wears a badge,
he's a blue boy.
What are you giving me?
You think I'm stupid?
Get rid of him, will you?
He is a cop.
That's not all.
He's also in business for himself.
And what he wants,
he wants 100%.
Here's what he wants.
It checks, it figures.
What do you mean "it checks"?
How does it figure.
Downstairs, I saw his face.
I remembered him.
- From when? From where?
- The night we pulled the job,
outside the mansion,
the two cops who questioned me,
he was one of them.
- Just what are you trying to engineer?
- He's the engineer.
He pulled a trace job
that wins the Grand Prize.
Nat, please.
Don't you see how it figures.
He knew I was hitting
that mansion for loot.
Stop it! Don't try to sell me short.
He didn't want the other cop to know.
At the station house, he gets
his own car, he doubles back.
He watches us, gives us a head start,
then follows us.
Face it, Gladden. He's a spider weaving
his web, trying to pull you in.
Come on, let's get outta here,
get your things.
No, I'm not going.
- What?
- I said I'm not going.
Not with you.
I'm done, Mister,
I've had it.
Gladden, what is it?
What's the matter?
You don't know?
You really don't know?
Look at me!
I'm a woman.
I'm flesh and blood
and I've got feelings.
But you never knew that,
you never wanted to know.
I was starving for you.
Night after night,
I drew the pillow apart
with my teeth.
So hungry for you.
Wanted you so much, I...
You,
you knew from nothing.
I was just another gadget, a tool kit.
Now is the quitting time.
I'm not of the organization.
- You'll change your mind.
- Wanna bet?
You'll come back in.
We'll be waiting.
You'd better stock up on groceries,
because you're in for a long wait.
We're in a wooden shack near the bay.
Four blocks West
of the Albany Avenue bridge.
You're talking for what?
Go on, Mister.
Take a walk.
{\i1}The only thing you got
is keeping your word.{\i}
{\i1}Give me your word of honor.{\i}
{\i1}Anything ever happens to me,{\i}
{\i1}give me your word{\i}
{\i1}you'll take care of Gladden.{\i}
{\i1}you'll take care of Gladden.{\i}
What did you do it for?
What did you do it for?
She told she was out
of the organization
She wants to leave, she's out.
She's given us a kiss off
and what does he do?
He gives her the emeralds.
He gives her the emeralds!
Operator, I'd like to make
a long distance call to Philadelphia.
Greenwood 30456.
I need you down here right away.
Why? What's happened?
Is he there?
What do you think
I'm calling you for?
Can I see him?
Can I talk to him again?
No, we tried that angle
and it didn't work.
Hereon, we're gonna to do it my way.
That's out,
none of that, Charlie.
It's gonna be handled my way.
If we don't move in now,
we're gonna be done.
We're playing against time.
Get that through your head.
I can't keep driving back and forth
between here and Philly.
I didn't report to duty last night.
If I go on like that,
somebody's going to catch on.
Charlie, listen to me.
No.
You listen to me.
Don't argue with me.
Put your classy frame in your convertible
and get down here as fast as you can.
Listen...
They're hiding out
in a small wooden shack.
I'll tell you where it is.
Come here a minute.
You see them?
See what?
The boats.
There are boats, so what?
Transportation.
That cabin-cruiser.
The white on?
I'm gonna have a look.
What do you know about boats?
They float.
Come on in.
Join the party.
Scared?
You don't have to be.
I'll give you a real break.
All you have to do is
to hand it over.
All right, that can be arranged.
Now when?
- I need a little time.
- No, no, you ain't got time.
You're going to take it out
from wherever it is right now.
And slide it across to me.
Nice and easy.
I haven't got it, Charlie.
You don't?
What a pity!
What a real pity!
Turn around.
Wait, Charlie, don't do it.
- Not yet.
- Why not?
Why waste time?
- Charlie, listen.
- He's got it, I know he's got it.
Maybe not.
Want me to make sure?
Go on, search him.
Tell me something, pal.
- How old are you?
- Thirty five.
Fifty six.
Look, Charlie.
If I tell you where it is,
what guarantee do I have that
you won't drill me anyway?
- It depends.
- Depends on what?
Information, whether I buy it or not.
I guess you know I'm not joking.
- I know that.
- Good.
We both know that
if I pull this trigger,
nobody's gonna call it murder.
But law enforcement.
- You sure got yourself a nice hand.
- Save your compliments.
- All that I want is that necklace.
- Cool yourself, Charlie.
- You'll get it.
- Convince me.
Come on, your time's running out.
Hotel Ocean View.
No, no, no sale.
She's got it, Charlie,
it's in that room.
How come I didn't see it?
I've been putting in a lot of time
with that babe.
I know every inch of that room.
And it wasn't there.
It's there now, Charlie.
I put it there.
For a reason.
Get his gun.
Check up the clip.
Give me the car keys.
If he moves an inch,
drill him.
It'll make you famous.
You'll get a medal
from the Police Department.
Nice weather out there.
- Mind if I take a stroll?
- Don't move.
You don't walk out that door unless
you go with me.
- With you?
- All the way.
When Charlie gets back,
we won't be here.
Wall? What's it gonna be?
A gamble!
Strictly a long shot.
- You'd better call off that bet.
- I can't. Don't you see how it is?
I'm dealing with time,
I've got to get to Gladden.
Nat, please, don't go for that door.
Stay away from that door.
Room 42. Hurry!
{\i1}Gladden, that you?
You all right?{\i}
You've got to get out of there fast.
If you don't get out now,
you'll never get out alive.
{\i1}I haven't got time to talk.
I'll talk to you later.{\i}
I'll meet you on the boardwalk.
At the Steel Pier. Wait for  me there.
Gladden!
We've got to go back to the bay.
There's a boat there...
- What is it you've got?
- The music box.
Officer, you wait.
I'll take over hereon in.
I warned headquarters.
{\i1}We,{\i}
{\i1}the dead,{\i}
{\i1}welcome you.{\i}
What cop?
He never contacted me.
O.K.
I'll see that later.
No, not yet, don't move in,
that pier's too crowded,
I don't want anybody to get hurt.
This is it.
{\i1}We,{\i}
{\i1}the dead,{\i}
{\i1}welcome you.{\i}
{\i1}Direct from their fabulous
European Tour,{\i}
{\i1}the sensational Wirengaard.{\i}
Tired?
I'm all right.
We'll stay here a while longer
and then work out our way back.
I'm worried, Nat.
I don't like it out here.
Let's move!
Not yet.
Enjoy the show.
{\i1}Ladies and Gentlemen,
that's our show for tonight.{\i}
{\i1}Thanks for coming
and please, come again.{\i}
You want it, Charlie?
Big joke!
Yeah, I want it.
Buy it!
What's the price?
You let her go.
- She can talk.
- She won't talk.
She knows better than that.
Whatever happens,
it's her word against yours.
And you're a cop, remember?
If she opens her mouth,
they'll send her up.
All right.
You got a deal.
Please, Nat,
can't you see what he's gonna do?
As soon as he's got it, he'll plug you.
He'll say you reached for a gun.
Go on!
Do as I'm telling you.
I'll catch up with you later.
All right, pal,
go on!
Wait a minute, miss.
Where're you coming from?
Nat, Nat, are you there?
Nice work, Charlie.
What did he do,
reach for his gun?
No.
It's not that at all.
He tried to get away.
You rotten liar!
{\i1}- What is she doing?
- He's done.{\i}
{\i1}Call the coroner
and put him on ice.{\i}
He had the necklace on him all right.
What do you mean, "he had"?
He was afraid to be caught
with it on.
Threw  it away in the ocean.
No, it's not true, Charlie.
He's got him.
Take him down to headquarters
and lock him up.
What do we mark it, captain?
Mark it "victim".
