The National Files Association produced a film
who should interest you.
Let us see a little.
The morning of April 20,1999 was
one morning like the others in America:
the farmer left to the fields,
the slag delivered milk,
the president bombarded a country once again
we could not pronounce the name,
in Fargo, in North Dakota,
Kerry McWilliams carried out his morning walk,
in Michigan, Mrs. Hughes accomodated
its pupils for a new day of class
and in a small city of Colorado two
young people went to the bowling to 6h of the morning.
Yes, it was one day normal
in the United States of America.
Can I help you?
- Yes, I would like to open an account.
And which kind of account?
Euh, that which gives right a free rifle.
- Well.
In the local newspaper of Michigan, North Country
Bank announced in an advertising insert,
that it offered a rifle
with whoever an account opened.
We need only one deposit.
Thus read our booklet.
As soon as we take your co-ordinates,
you will be able to carry rifle.
Yes, it is this kind of account which I would like.
In our strongroom,
we always have
at least 500 weapons with fire.
- 500? In the strongroom?
We must establish your antecedents.
- Here, at the bank?
Yes. We are recorded like arms manufacture.
Really?
Bank and arms manufacture at the same time?
What I put for "race"?
White or Caucasien?
Caucasien.
It is well what I feared.
That is written... Cau-Ca-his,
it is that?
- Yes.
It is not very significant.
"you were recognized mentally irresponsible
or you remained in psychiatric hospital?"
I never was in psychiatric hospital,
but what means "recognized
mentally irresponsible "?
In relation to a crime.
Ah, of agreement. Thus if I am only
a little disturbed...
Here is, Mike.
- Thank you well.
I have some like that too.
He holds well in hand.
It is a rifle of quality,
it is me which says it to you.
Waou... owl!
You do not find that a little dangerous,
to distribute weapons in a bank?
Each rifle does much noise.
Support on the relaxation and listen to yourself!
One would believe to hear a shooting.
It is a truth?
It has the true air.
And it makes the noise of a truth!
And how! Noise of the army rifles
and of rifles of Western of Marx!
It was my first rifle.
I waited impatiently to leave
to go to draw in the neighbourhoods.
Good old days...
When I was adolescent, I was already so good with the shooting
that I gained the price of the best gunner
National Files Association.
I grew in Michigan,
a paradise for the in love ones with the weapons.
Like this man,
oscarized actor
and chair National Files Association:
M. Charlton Heston.
In our State, everyone likes to go to hunting,
even dogs.
Two hunters in a camping
wanted to photograph their dog
equipped in hunter, just to laugh.
One of the hunters proposed to attach
a rifle on the back of the dog
to make the photograph more interesting.
The victim had just knelt
in front of the dog, when the weapon slipped.
The ball broke the tibia to him
and arose by the calf.
Was the dog placed
in detention by the police force?
Not.
The law of Michigan specifies that human
can commit a crime, but an animal...
they are not people... they cannot
thus not to commit crimes.
An animal cannot be shown in this State?
- Exactly.
It is possible that the dog knew
what it did?
I do not know anything of it,
I cannot say.
The dog was to have funny pace
equipped like that in hunter...
The image was amusing.
It had to be seen!
Ouais, it is of an area as that that I come.
A box of 270.
- That comes, one moment.
Here!
- Perfect.
Sorry...
They are not defeats.
It is not a control of the weapons only it
us is necessary, but a control of the balls.
Believe, they are to me the balls
that it is necessary to control.
Each ball should cost 5 000 dollars.
5 000 dollars per ball.
You know why?
If a ball costs 5 000 dollars,
there will be never again of "not-implied people".
And if somebody is made draw above, one says oneself:
"It had well to do something,
if not one would not balance to him
50 000 dollars in the bottom "
It would be necessary to think of the price
before shooting at somebody:
"I would explode you the head,
if I had the means of them.
I seek myself another job,
I put a little money on side
and then be to you a dead man!
And you go morfler,
when I would have my balls with credit "
Not far from the birthplace of Charlton Heston
a camp of drive is
of the militia of Michigan.
Why you use skittles?
From a military point of view, they constitute
a target of small size.
And they are with breast height,
times that one would have to shoot at somebody.
The militia of Michigan made known itself whole world
April 19,1995, when two of its active members,
Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols,
blew a building féderal in Oklahoma City
and killed 168 people.
The militia of Michigan hastened to ensure
that it had nothing to do with McVeigh and Nichols.
For the Americans, it is a tradition
and an obligation to be armed.
That which is not armed
acts in an irresponsible way.
Who protects your children?
Cops? The government?
None between-them.
It is your duty to defend you.
That which does not do it, lack
with its duty of citizen. It is all.
People must know
that we help them,
we are not the malicious ones
but defenders of the people.
People like us,
one would like to have them like neighbors.
You are there when there is fire.
Yes, and we are normal people with a job.
What we do here,
it is during our spare time.
You do what in the life?
- Draughtsman in a cabinet of architects.
And you?
- Unemployed person.
You, Frank?
- Driver of heavy lorries for
a company of heating.
And you?
- I am real estate agent.
Real estate agent?
- a quite clean use of office.
But it you it pleasing steps with you
at the estate agency, not?
Not.
Where you live?
- In Westland.
What you have at the house?
- "Smith and Wesson" 9 mm.
And you?
- a gauge 12.
And you?
- M-16
At the house?
Within reach.
You know at least where to place your arms?
I know where to place them to draw.
Who had the idea of the calendar?
Probably Kristen.
- an image is better than all the words.
Initially, that shows a level that one
militia does not wait inevitably.
Then also, we are only men.
One had fun.
- That brought back money to us and that showed
that we if are not wedged.
We are not insane conspirators
who want to remain anonymous.
It was an amusing action.
I have weapons
since I have the age of it.
I learned how with me to be useful about it.
Do not make silly things...
As a woman particularly,
I wanted to me protèger
as well as possible.
When your house is burglarized,
who you in first call?
The majority of people call the police force
because they are armed.
Forget the intermediaries!
Take care of your family yourself.
Who must protect your family,
if it is not yourself?
We are not racist,
nor of the extremists, fundamentalist,
terrorists, militants
or of similar idiocies.
We are responsible citizens
who fill their duties of Americans.
And for that there is a militia.
What you plant?
- Currently of the tofu, soya beans...
You are a farmer of soya?
- Yes, I cultivate food.
Food to be eaten, you include/understand?
Guarantee without weedkiller nor pesticide.
I include/understand... natural food.
It is better.
- biological Agriculture.
Better for health, even.
Here James Nichols,
the brother of Terry Nichols.
James finished his studies, the same year
that me, in the close district.
In this farm of Decker to Michigan, McVeigh and the Nichols brothers
built the bomb-test for Oklahoma City.
Terry and James were stopped
after the bombing.
The prosecutor sees a report/ratio
between the brothers Nichols and McVeigh.
James who attended the debates and
Terry who missed were
shown to have produced bombs
smaller.
Terry Nichols was declared guilty
and condemned to perpetuity.
Timothy McVeigh was carried out.
Against James they did not have any element;
the continuations were thus abandoned for lack of evidence.
I am happy to be again free
and of being able to live my life.
Did Timothy McVeigh live here?
- Yes.
On several occasions. Longest
period had to last approximately three months.
It was a sympathetic nerve type.
A type well?
The police force did not find anything?
- What?
What to build a bomb?
- explosives.
Eh well... of the detonators and the wicks of dynamite,
blasting powder,
gas oil, manure,
but it is normal farm equipment.
That does not have absolutely anything to see
with the bomb of Oklahoma-City.
When guards of the law,
if one can call them thus, were here,
they trembled.
They trembled.
They were afraid of death.
How that?
They thought that it was new Waco
because certain people,
my ex-wife and other people,
said that I was a radical
with a weapon under each arm,
with each leg, in each shoe,
in each corner.
Who descends that which says something.
When people realize
how they were misled...
and reduced to slavery by our government,
by the powerful ones...
Then they will revolt, full with anger.
Furious, without pity
and blood will run with floods.
When a government becomes tyrannical,
there is the duty to reverse it.
Why not method of Gandhi?
He pushed back the British empire without the weapons.
I do not know.
Oscada has the bad habits
to make leave the psychopates.
Here Brent
And his/her comrade "DJ".
They live in Oscada in Michigan,
not far from the farm of Nichols.
Eric Harris, that which thereafter perpetrated
crimes with the college of Columbine in Colorado,
part of its childhood passed here.
Eric lived at the base of the Air Force
in Oscada, where his/her father remained in so much
that controls during the war of the Golf.
20% of all the bombs to the war were released
by planes which had taken off of Oscoda.
I asked Brent if it still remembered Eric.
I did not know it personally.
It left before I do not come in this corner there.
I have been here only for seven years.
You know people who know it?
Yes, a friend with me connait,
he was in his class.
I was shocked when I heard the news.
Amongst other things that somebody from here does that.
I was transfered relatively quickly of the college, here.
Why?
I had an argument with a pupil
and I left a weapon.
Which weapon?
- One 9 mm.
That could very badly have been finished.
- Very badly?
Very badly.
- You could have been Eric Harris.
You were then returned?
- Yes,380 Days.
Or 165...
One school year whole, in fact.
I also had a long time the intention
to leave for Colorado.
Colorado?
- I have there of the family.
My uncle is an even caretaker
with the college of Columbine.
Really? How it was, of return to Oscada,
after Columbine?
I was the second on the list of the bombs.
Because of the réputaion that one tankard here.
How? There was a list with...
Suspects.
Pupils who could threaten Columbine
of one bombing?
And you were number 2 on the list?
- Yes, number 2 or 3.
And why?
Quite simply because...
this city disparages people.
But how they went up with you?
I was a problem child.
Problems at the school?
- Oh yes!
But why you were precisely
number 2 on the list...
potentially dangerous pupils??
Go, it must y have a reason well
- And well...
I have this trick named "Book of kitchen for anarchists".
At the interior, it is explained
how one manufactures bombs.
When something arrives, they come initially
at home and I do not need that.
Just because you have this book?
You never yet manufactured bombs?
- Not... finally if, already.
Not large size,
smaller than a grenade.
As a kind of small bomb of
cut of a ball of tennis.
The last thing which I built
starting from the book, it was I believe,
a barrel of 20 liters napalm.
Napalm makes house.
Your comrades were with the current?
- Yes.
And you were number 2 on the list.
Who were number 1?
They never revealed me the name,
what made me shit.
Because you were not number 1?
- Yes I know it is idiotic...
But it is a business of personal pride.
I could have been number 1 in Oscada
and on the list of the bombs.
The attack of Oklahoma City was it right?
I do not say that it was you...
- Not, not...
Why the building was shaven?
It is a good question.
And by which?
It does not matter which it was, it was not right?
It was an error to kill these people?
I use the plumee because it is more powerful
that the sword.
But one must always have a sword within reach
if the feather would be failing.
I sleep with a Magnum 44 pennies the pillow.
Thus let us go, that, everyone says it.
This is true?
- Yes.
The whole world knows it.
There is, in this moment, a Magnum under your pillow?
Sincerely?
You would show it to us?
It led me in its room, but the caméraman
had to remain with the exterior.
He had really a Magnum 44 pennies the pillow.
It is thus him.
It is charged?
NICHOLS ARMS THE GUN
AND SE HOLDS IT AGAINST THE TEMPLE.
You carry the gun to addendum?
But it arrives to me nothing.
- It is charged!
But inoffensive.
One engages the relaxation,
one arms the dog and one draws.
Disarm the dog.
Nobody has the right to confiscate it to me!
It is protected by the constitution.
Guns?
Not, weapons with fire...
- It is not writing "weapons with fire".
It is writing "weapons".
- That are the weapons?
For example of the nuclear weapons...
- Exact!
You think that you should have the right
to have plutonium in the farm?
Plutonium which one can be useful oneself for the weapons?
- I do not want any
But should have the right of it to you?
That should be restricted.
You thus believe in the restrictions?
There are outside the insane ones which runs.
The town of Virgin in Utah obliges
each inhabitant, in accordance with the law,
to have a weapon.
DRAW ON THE CRETIN
Kerry McWilliams shows proudly
the result of its examination of shooting.
However it cannot see it at all.
Indeed, it is blind.
Kerry likes the weapons since it held in the hands,
for the first time, M-16 whereas it was adolescent.
I smell myself well with fast weapons with fire.
It is a superb place to raise children.
Really superb.
We are a narrow community.
Each one paid attention to the other.
- good people?
It is simply a place,
Where 2 young men made bad decisions
and which, thereafter, f?rent known universally.
Besides that, Littleton is of nothing
different from other suburbs.
I would like to entrust to you that
I found the place ideal...
for our new power station of company:
South Denver Subway.
You see that, here, I do not need any
because there is as much sun
and of precipitations with South Denver Subway
that in the south of California.
It is incredible.
- See yourself.
How you like that, Mr. Edwards?
We are in the south of Denver,
in a small named commune Littleton.
Here, it is a house of suburbs
typical of the middle class.
The burglar or rapist is still
some share in trimmings.
Sometimes the citizens come to see me and say...
Where is the burglar or rapist exactly?
If I wanted to kill you here
with blows of knives,
you should be near, is not this?
Yes. With final...
- And if I had a lance?
Below a room of safe was arranged.
It is a massive door.
A door carries.
The intruder should first of all insert this door.
A difficult barrier.
With an axe that should go.
- It is true.
I think that Columbine changed two things:
Firstly, how we speak.
Why?
When I pronounce "Columbine",
each one knows what I think.
I should explain to nobody but Columbine...
That there is?
- Nothing
What there is?
Sometimes Columbine saddens me...
That will better be...
- There, there.
There is something...
Of overpowering with this...
spite, this manner bestiale,
these deaths...
without understanding.
The largest factory of weapons in the world.
This factory,
and two additional, where our employees work,
are located at Littleton or the neighbourhoods.
We have beyond
5 000 employees in our company.
Many between-them live in Littleton
And several of between-them have children
with the Columbine college.
I suppose that in a certain manner,
one can say that what arrived at Columbine,
represent in smaller,
what occurs throughout the world.
There is this signature which one sees here, you are
those which say:"We are Columbine"
Lockheed Martin, is the largest employer,
the largest producer of weapons, then:
"We are Columbine"?
I think that one probably represents this spirit:
"We all are members of this community"
That wants to say that we must help the ones the others,
Yes, it is that which one wants to represent.
They it is said to us that nobody has Littleton,
including the owners of Lockheed,
Could not include/understand why the boys of Columbine
in came to violence.
Why?
Why these children did that?
Some of most undisciplined surely have
have evil to contain their anger
We are conscious of the importance
programmes of prevention of violence.
Therefore, we made gift of 100. 000 dollars
at the school Jefferson Kaney for
that they develop these programs.
In these schools, we hope to help
in the same way, professors and pupils,
to learn how to manage anger together.
Therefore, you do not think that there is
children who say themselves:
"Dad works with the factory every morning"
and..."It manufactures missiles, they are weapons
of destrucion massive "
"Which difference with this destrucion massive
and massive destruction with Columbine "?
It is that I do not see connection,
because the missiles of which you speak are manufactured
and thought to defend us
of a possible external attacker,
or of governments, companies, country
who could of "annoy" others.
But we must learn how to manage anger
caused by others or some frustration.
One does not go, only because somebody annoys us
to pose bombs or to kill...
or to send a missile to him...

We will wait until the situation improves
and we will be able to say some more.
Organizes from Jefferson,911.
- Here in Columbine, of the shots.
There is a casualty?
- Yes
They have bombs, of Uzis.
They have of all, guy!

Another took a ball in the head.
- In the head?
Office of the Sheriff.
- We have automatic weapons.
Send full of ambulances!
Does the shooting continue?
- Yes.
We try to reach the pupils
who were touched.
Let enter nobody here.
Organizes from Jefferson,911.
- Hello, here Izzy Povich of NBC.
We speak about the shooting at the school.
we are on line on MSNBC.
Can you to already say something us...
I want to say... there now, on line?
You could intervene immediately in the emission.
- I included/understood.
It appears that it is now
in the library.
The guy is thus in the library now?
Stephanie Phillips of "Dateline",
how that is?
Well, thank you.
I adore your emission!
I am happy.
- I never miss you!
Mercy.
- please.
Organizes from Jefferson,911.
I am a professor with the college.
A pupil made jump a window.
There is a casualty?
- Yes!
Panic reigns here...
I am in the library...
Under the tables children!
Lower the head!
One of the pupils was outside...
My god!
I saw a rifle and I shouted:
"What occurs here?"
He shot at once at us.
The window flew in glares... I believe
that the pupils beside me were touched.
The helps are on the way, Madam.
My god!
- Remain on line.
He draws in the library.
He draws from the shots.
Must we leave?
- One moment...
Maintaining the shots come from the cafeteria.
I must leave from here, I recall you...
Where the camera must go?
That made an eternity until I wait.
Hello, here Wendy for CNN.
Hello, Wendy.
We will rapellerons the press later.
But Fox had somebody.
Why Fox had somebody?
I know, but we have too many calls.
We cannot speak with everyone.
I must speak to my daughter.
That made one hour that I test.
Dear Sir, you calm.
We have the right to know
where are our children!
We have already world in action.
I do not manage to join anybody!
I must speak to my daughter!
How can I have his news?
I do not have any information!
Why, good blood?
I am afraid that my son, Eric Harris,
has something to see in this shooting.
Good Ah, what?
It is a member of what they call
the "Maffia of impermeable".
You spoke to him today?
- Not. You have already somebody?
We still seek the culprits.
In which band is your son?
They are called the "Maffia of impermeable".
I heard the name with television.
Remain below. I do not want only one
you draws above.
Remain down there and hold you quiet.
When the shooting was finished,
Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold...
had killed 12 pupils and a teacher.
Hundreds of others were wounded morally
or physically by the thousand of balls
that they had drawn
The weapons which they used were
all legal and bought in shops
and salesmen of weapons neighbourhood.
And majority of the bought balls one
in K-mart de Littleton, just in bottom of the street.
The private diary of Harris details also the plans...
taking of hostage of a plane,
followed by a crash to New York.
Much qualified that of imagination.
To finish, they turned the weapons on them...
And then it returned in the blibliotèque one,
they drew on everyone around me.
Then it pointed the weapon on my head
and it asked to me whether I wanted to die.
At the beginning, one heard shots in the hall.
One said to us to remain under the tables.
Then it arrived in the bibliotèque one,
it opened fire.
I started to shout and cry,
I asked him not to kill me.
And it killed a girl, it drew to him
in the head in front of me.
It killed a black elève, because it was black.
I have only 6 words for you:
Of my cold and dead hands!!
Just 10 days after the massacre of Columbine
and in spite of the mourning of the community,
Charlton Heston came to Denver
and a great meeting gave...
of defense of the wearing of weapon,
in the name of the National Association Files.
Hello!
Thank you with all to have come,
thank you to support our association.
I would like to also applaud your courage,
to have come today.
I have a message of the mayor,
M. Wellington Webb, the mayor of Denver.
It sent this message to me:
"do not come here,
we do not want you here "
I answer the Mayor: This country is our country,
and as Americans, we are free to travel
where good seems to us on our broad grounds.
"do not come here"?
We are already there!
I am here today
because my Daniel son would have liked
to see me today here.
If my Daniel son did not etait one of the victims,
he would be with me today.
There is something which does not go in this country.
When a child...
can take a weapon so easily,
and to shoot at another child...
in the medium of its face of child,
like my son in made the experiment,
something does not go.
And the moment had just included/understood,
that Semi-automatic Tech 9,30 balls,
like that which killed my son,
does not have to be used to kill.
It should not serve as the whole!
It is time to deal with this problem.
We have work:
Hearts to be alleviated.
Devil to be overcome
and a country to be linked.
We have disagreements, yes
and we will have, in the future, to support
indescribable tragedies.
But if the sun dies today
and in the future in Denver,
it must disappear for us, the people.
Security in our country of freedom,
in the hearth of the brave men.
And for my part, I try to make my possible.
When they hold their congress,
in Colorado,
one week after Columbine...
- the NRA?
Of course you have the "right",
But that becomes an obsession,
what you want...
It is Matt Stone.
Here Is Matt Stone,
He grew in Littleton and he remembers Columbine.
Bah, Columbine were, you know... a school of shit.
Matt and its friend Trey Parker found a means
to express their anger, to be different in Littleton.
Not in the form of a carnage, but of a cartoon...
Just another Sunday morning,
in my quiet small town of mountain,
one can see his breath in the air,
one can see tramps but one paid there not attention,
it is a sea of smiling so much so that one can drown there.
Just another Sunday morning in quiet, small and shitting
town of full mountain bumpkin.
Columbine is a normal college in normal suburbs.
Ouais, awfully normal,
painfully normal.
Just awfully and absolutely usual.
Littleton in general, it is that.
I etais in 6th, I believe
and I was to pass the examination of math to go in 5th
and one said to me:
"you cannot miss this examination of math,
because if you miss it,
you will not be able to make a success of the next one...
and it will be similar in 4th,3rd,2nde
and you will burst all alone as a tramp ".
You see what it is.
You believe in the school, and a majority of these kids,
but Profs, the main thing and
the others do not help you.
They frighten you to oblige you to adapt you,
with being good at the school,
by saying you:"If you are a loser now,
you will be always a loser ".
One said to Eric and Dylan that they were not worth anything.
They were said:"I will remain
a shit all my life ".
If somebody had only said to them:
"the University is not a finality.
More than one year and finished you..."
They remained to them only two weeks!
Yes. And we will re-examine these people never again.
But they put to you very early in the head:
"all does not waste,
if not you will die poor and solitary "
And you think:"Shit, which I am
now, I am it for always!"
That does not stick. The dunces can become
of supers businessmen,
and the fixed types can become
insurance agents in Littleton.
That applies at almost everyone!
Perhaps that they would not have done it,
if somebody had said that to them.
I think that nobody knows why they did it,
but there is a thing which the adults must include/understand:
It is that it is shitting to be a teenager.
And that bores to death really of going to the school!
Which is your vision of the college?
Hum, I like the college, I learn.
I have Profs which hates me,
and the director is a trouduc.
Ok, which is the cause of violence at the school?
Him.
Yes, and after Columbine, it became
really shitting to be student in America,
since the shooting of the Columbine college.
The colleges of the country developpé the policy
tolerance zero,
while suspending or by expelling any pupil having
a behavior considered as bad,
or showing signs of violence to come.
This pupil of 2nde was suspended 10 days
to have brought a nail-clippers in class,
the school regarding it as a weapon.
A primary school suspended a pupil of CP,
to have pointed a piece of chicken
towards a professor in the cafeteria.
The young person was lunching,
when it imitated a pointing gunner...
its weapon on a teacher and shouted:"Side, side!"
It pointed a paper sheet folded
as a weapon towards a comrade of class
and he says to him that he was going to kill it,
during a set of hide-and-seek.
If it is not an alarm,
what it is?
This pupil of Virginia was expelled one month,
because it had dyed its hair in blue.
One returned this pupil of elite of Michigan,
the young person Jeremy Hicks 17 year old, who carried
a costume Shelled for a school festival:
a kilt and a hat of feathers,
who belong to the tradition
of Sgian-Dubh-Messer.
This Tee-shirt sent a coed to the court,
she wanted to launch an anarchistic club.
Here, one hears the tick-tock of the time bombs,
who can leave constantly.
Several in each commune.
Pupils of seven different States
were suspended or stopped
to have spoken about it or for
to have organized attacks.
That resembles to a guerrilla.
One does not know which direction the enemy will come.
To have a strict policy
with regard to clothing,
increase the safety of the school automatically
and can ensure an environment of training
positive for all.
As this pupil shows it,
to have a negligent policy in what
relate to clothing, allows the children
to hide more easily of the weapons,
and more difficult the identification makes
of intruder on the campus.
A uniform reduces the risks
to see introduced weapons,
prevent the signs between the gangs,
reduced the infringements to the discipline
and the atmosphere improves in general of the school.
We count on shirts
strict and adjusted.
Thus the size is regulated.
The pupils should not wear Baggies jean,
or of the colors and badges
generally associated the activity of the gangs.
This regulation is a collective business.
Yes, our children were really to fear.
Yes, our children really released from the fury.
They had been transformed into monsters.
But which etait responsible?
The experts did not have an answer:
Alternative culture heavy-metal.
Where the parents etaient?
The films violent one,
South Park,
the plays vidéos,
Television,
plastic weapons,
Satan,
Cartoons,
The company,
drug,
The rocker Marilyn Manson.
Marilyn Manson finishes his American round
and presenté its regards with died of Littleton.
However the singer said
that artists like, were not responsible to him.
It is the group more removed from rim
that a large house of disc
ever under contract had.
"I am not the slave...
of God who does not exist."
It seems that there is not for the massacre
of Columbine that only one explanation:
It is that the assassins listened of Marilyn Manson.
Two years after Columbine, Manson
returned to Denver.
The ozzfest makes return the rockor of shock tomorrow,
Manson, In Denver.
There were demonstrations of monk of right-hand side.
But I said myself, I will speak to him personally.
Child and while growing, music
it was for me an exit.
It was the only possibility of escaping the prejudices.
A disc you engueule not
because are oddly equipped to you.
It makes you be better smelled in your choices.
Some require of me, causing,
if we really believe that all those which
go to a concert of Manson, will make
the shortly after the sanguinary acts.
The answer is not.
All those which see a publicity
for the Lexus cars will buy one of them?
Not.
But some, yes.
I include/understand why they chose me.
It is easy to present my head
with tele,
because, finally, I am the representation,
for the young people, fear.
I personify that of which all are afraid,
because I say what I want.
Marilyn Manson causes in our city
hatred and violence,
the suicide, death, drug
and praises the merits of the behavior with Columbine.
Not without our opposition!
Two by-products
of this tragedy were...
violence in the spectacles
and controls of weapons.
As that falls although, precisely,
they are the two topics of the presidential campaign.
Blow, one forgets the case Monica Lewinsky
and that the president bombards
other countries.
But I am the bad lot
because I sing songs of rock' N roll.
Who has the most influence:
the president or Marilyn Manson?
I préfèrerais: me,
but it is the president.
You knew that the USA, the day of Columbine,
Launched the majority of the bombs
war of Kosovo?
I knew it and
I find that extremely
that nobody says:"the president
influenced these acts of violence "
But the Mediae do not want
to present that in this way.
Because with television
and with the news
one must be stuffed fear:
Tidal waves, the AIDS, the murder.
Advertizing pauses:
"Acura Buys, buys Colgate."
"If you have bad breath, nobody will speak himself."
"If you have buttons, no girl kisses with you."
It is a campaign of the fear
and of consumption.
I think that all is built
around the idea...
to maintain all people anxious
so that they consume.
I believe that one could reduce that.
If you could speak
with people of Columbine,
what you would say to them?
I would not say anything, I would listen to them.
And it is precisely that which nobody did.
I am called Nicole Schlieve.
- And me, it is Amanda Lamontaigne.
School of Columbine?
You were with Eric and Dylan,
In the same class?
- Yes, in the class of Bowling.
The class of Bowling?
What it is?
One can do that in sport.
Where is the teaching value?
There is not.
- Not.
I can better play bowling,
that it is sure.
How behaved Eric Dylan?
- Oddly.
Not very sociable.
- I hardly knew them.
They were very contained.
They were good players of bowling?
I remember
that they balanced like the insane ones,
the ball in the corridor.
That was equal for them how they played.
- They foutaient result of it.
What they did the morning of the day of the massacre?
I only intended to say that they played bowling.
Therefore, Dylan and Eric, this morning, made
a bowling and still played 2 front turns
to open the shooting at the school?
And right jeté the balls in their corridor had?
That means something, that?
They went in their preferred class.
Why nobody returned the bowling
person in charge to have turned over the brain of Eric
and of Dylan to make this insane act?
It would not be also plausible
to show Marilyn Manson?
Finally, it was the last thing
that they made before the massacre.
Wait one second...
In other countries also, one plays bowling.
And your step Marilyn Manson also in Germany does not listen,
the fatherland lugubrious Gothic music?
Don't the French see
same films of violence?
The majority of the video games violent ones come from Japan.
Many Americans believe that it is the bursting
of the family which leaves the young people...
to become difficult and violent one.
Good, then I commit suicide! What you say that?
You will not retain me here!
But according to the statistics, there is in Great Britain
more destroyed families and divorces that in the USA.
It is official!
The couple of Fergie is finished!
The liberals affirm that great poverty
in America would be the reason of this violence.
But in Canada, the rate of unemployment is 2 times higher.
The majority of people say, naturally,
that that would come from the violent history,
past violate of America.
Cowboys, Indians, wild West,
a history of conquests of blood baths.
Then, if that is enough to explain a violent company
like ours in America...
which explanation can one give for that?
THE GERMANS KILL 12 MILLION
THE JAPANESE OCCUPY CHINA
MASSACRE FRENCH IN ALGERIE
BRITISH CARNAGE IN INDIA
And in spite of that: How many people
die killed by balls in one year?
In Germany:381
In France:255
In Canada:165
In Great Britain:68
In Australia:65
In Japan:39
In the USA:11127
A significant question
impose yourself on me.
What we have the different ones,
us, Americans?
Let us be us of the meurtiers by nature?
Because in Europe, in Australia,
in the majority of the free countries
that is not seen, that people lose control
and are taken by Amok.
They are not different,
they have right less people taken of fatal madness.
English supporters of football
are not children of chorus.
Each time I try to compare
with the other countries, I intend to say:
"Our culture is completely different."
But over there there is too
brutal plays vidéos, films violent one,
young lunatics
and they do not have prayers in the schools.
Then, what is so radically different?
What it is?
- What it is?
I do not know it.
Maintaining a short presentation of the history
from the United States of America.
Hello, young people and girls!
You are ready?
It was once people of Pilgrims,
who lived in Europe.
They were afraid to be persecuted.
They embarked in a boat and sailed
towards the New World where they would not have
more need to be afraid.
I if am slackened!
I feel safe so much!
But, as of their arrival they were accomodated
by savages and were again
terribly frightened.
Then they killed them.
But even this massacre of the population
could not calm them.
With the place they were craignèrent
ones others.
Witch!
- Then, they burned the witches.
1775: they killed the English
to be free.
And that went, but they did not feel
nevertheless not in safety.
The 2nd amendment of the Constitution authorized
each White to preserve its weapon.
Me to like my rifle.
That brought us to
brilliant idea of slavery.
You see, the White of front
were also afraid of work.
They went to Africa, removed
thousands of Blacks and brought them in America
and forced them to work hard
and that without paying them! And not:
"I work with the Wal-Mart supermarket
for almost nothing."
But:"zero dollars, nothing!"
It is like that that the USA
became the richest country of the world!
Richness and slaves
the White reassured?
Not!
They became even more anxious.
Because after 200 years of slavery
there was in the south, more Blacks than of White.
You can think what arrived.
The slaves rebelled
and a Master was decapitated.
When the white learned that, they shouted:
Do not kill black great man to me!
Samuel Colt still arrived in time,
to invent in 1836 the first weapon with fire
that one did not need to reload.
All the White of the south shouted:
Hurrah!
But it was nevertheless too late.
Nordistes gained the American Civil War,
and the slaves were released.
Free to decapitate all the slave ones.
They shouted:
Oh not! We will die!
But freed were not avenged.
They wanted right food in peace.
The White did not find that convainquant
and founded Ku-Klux-Klan.
Whereas in 1871, the KKK
group was declared terrorist,
Another lobby was founded:
the National Files Association.
The politicians voted a law
on the weapons with fire,
who made illegal, with the Blacks,
possession of weapons with fire.
It was one year outstanding for America,
the KKK and the NRA.
Both did not have naturally
nothing to see one with the other. Sheer coincidence.
One militated for the possession
of weapons with fire.
and the other shot and lynched the Blacks.
It went from there thus until 1955,
until a black woman refuses
to sit down at the bottom of a bus.
The White could not believe it!
What it thus has?
- What that wants to say?
From there, all went from through. Everywhere
the Blacks claimed their rights
and the White panicked à. fond
and shouted:
Save which can!
And they fled towards the external cities
where all was white, sure and clean.
They bought 250 million weapons,
locks, alarms, and built
barriers between neighbors.
There, they felt like
cock in paste.
And they lived happy
until the end of their days.
hein? really?
When one looks at the evening paper
it seems with that which looks at it,
that America is still quite sinister.
It is dangerous?
What it mijote?
What is this you make, guy?
Why people are afraid?
It was what the wind of panic for the year 2000?
Were us told only our company
was going to break down, parce somebody had forgotten
to return some figures in the computer?
Total chaos will burst.
The countdown begins this evening.
The manager attended the preparations
of its customers on arrival of the year 2000.
Piles, oil lamps and generators
are sold very well,
After having spread panic
in all the country, midnight sounded.
And nothing occurred.
It was what already with the history of the tueuses bees
who were to attack America?
They are planned for this year.
The African bees would have
to arrive at Texas this year,
and in Arizona in 2 or 3 years.
There is what to worry because the tueuses bees
are very aggressive.
They continue their victim on one half-mile.
The bees never came.
Or then history of the razor blade that somebody
would have hidden in an apple with Halloween.
For a long time in Hallowen, the children could not
neither to leave nor to accept sugar refineries from abroad.
A many people do not distribute any more
sugar refineries with Hallowen. The fear circulates.
And result? No razor blade in any apple.
And only 2 children died in 40 years
because of candies.
Both were knowingly poisoned by parents.
That occurred as in a film from horror.
This man was attacked by an outgoing fox
forest whereas it mowed its lawn.
One warns to us against the slimming pill.
What you do not know, can kill you.
They are used tous. les. jours, but each
escalator can shred us.
We prove that you too
use "the staircase of the danger".
Be careful, remain discrete,
do not dance with Americans
in the street.
And you do not point out
by saying that you are American.
An American on five is reached
of a psychic disorder.
The ministry for health advises
to be made examine as of now.
Media, consortia, politicians...
traumatisé the American population so much
that they arrived from there at a point where...
they do not have anything any more need to justify.
Today, legal authority
emitted an urgent warning.
It reacts by there, with a threat
that we received.
It is not the first time
the legal authority acts thus.
I hope that it is the last,
but the attitude of the criminal
does not let it suppose.
I like these boulevards.
One does not see any too often with L. A...
but each time I am here,
I hear with the news:
"Shots on the basis of a car
In "Central South"
or "This and that in Central South".
They do not invent nevertheless? If?
- Not but they séIéctionnent the events.
One puts the news at tele,
and one sees dangerous black men, it is that?
An anonymous Black,
who supposedly committed an unspecified crime.
One sees Blacks which did something
of reprehensible or one hears stories on top.
Throughout our life.
Young a 20 years Black is suspecté,
as well as an African with favourites and
chain silver plated.
The police force seeks
a man of black race of 1m80,
in the 80kg and approximately 35 years.
The suspect is Noir,
it has between 16 and 18 years.
An Afro-American was suspected.
Susan Smith drowned his two children
and told with all, that a black man...
he would have stolen its car and the children.
And all believe it.
A man jumped in the car to a red light
and left with the children.
He was black.
A man of black race?
- Yes
I shouted to them that I liked them.
It is so terrible.
" anonymous townsman an ",
i. e. a Black,
did that "
C ' is the way open to all.
Charles Stuart, lawyer in Boston,
kill its pregnant wife,
and known as that it is a black which made the blow.
Everyone believes it.
The suspect is of black race,
it measures about 1,80m,
The Stuart husbands were attacked
whereas they left a course
of painless childbirth.
An urban nightmare.
You know why I like this country so much?
It does not matter if you are killer psychopathe
or candidate with the presidency of the country,
one can be sure of a thing:
fear of the White for the Blacks.
One sees that with tele and in the press.
They kill out of people:
They are called the tueuses bees
or bees of Africa.
I am very afraid.
Rosemary Shibley would never have believed
that the tueuses bees could
to build a hive...
opposite its house.
I am terribly allergic there.
My grandson too.
At the beginning, they come
south-east of Africa.
In 1956, Dr. Warrick Care has
brought some specimens to Brazil,
to cross them with
European bees which one knows.
But they fled and went
in the southern states of the USA.
The African bee is more aggressive
that the bee from on our premises.
If I did that with African bees,
I would have in less than two,
a few hundreds of punctures.
Danny Self raises the good old woman European
bee. He knows himself there.
One cannot differentiate them
that by measuring their bodies.
The black people became
an entertainment for the others.
How?
The "crime of the day" gives distraction.
Blood is sold well.
That appears on first page.
And this image fits in the head
of all the nation.
That does not have any relationship with the truth.
On the contrary.
Majority of the Afro-Americans
are against the detention of weapons.
In the suburbs people think...
that a horde of intruder will come from the city...
or of an unknown place,
to devastate the suburbs.
I find that not only strange,
but also complétement unjustified.
The guns were not withdrawn
with the young people of the town of Flint,
But with those of the suburbs,
in the périurbaines communes
They are not the young Blacks
in the schools of the centres town
Who have weapons?
Not, it is...
One never had big problems
downtown with the weapons.
Of course, that arrives
but that was never "the" problem.
The principal problem
it is the detention of weapons...
young people of suburbs.
Your weapon comes from where?
- Flown.
By which?
- By a friend.
His/her father has weapons.
- What you made with?
One has sold in Détroit.
I am made 150 tickets for one 9 mm.
Really?
With which you sold it?
With which wanted it.
Bands mainly.
Bands of Strait?
Blacks?
For the majority yes.
And now you left there?
- Yes, I am free.
You always sell weapons?
- Not, it became too risky.
Everyone knows me here.
People who want weapons
or from drug come at home.
That goes at all.
- Too much emmerdes...
My preferred statistics
during my research it was:
The number of murders moved back of 20%,
Reports on the murders
with television...
increased by 600%.
American people
is conditioned by the chains of tele...
and of information, to believe that...
their communities are more
dangerous that they are not it really.
For example, here, the number of crimes
have decreased for eight years,
but the detention of weapons,
in particular by guns, increases.
The rate of criminality decreases, decreases,
fear of criminality
increase, increases.
Isn't it illogical?
Not, it is logical if one looks at
what politicians and media
current events convey.
We are here with the crossroads
Of Florence and Normandy.
It is here that item zero took place,
the departure, of the riots of L. A.
Some White, which were trotted
in Central South,
were killed.
It is a very widespread representation.
Probability, so that something
us arrives here, is very very weak.
Tiny.
But over there, opposite, there is another symbol:
The letters symbols of Hollywood,
who is for the Americans, and of share the world,
another thing that what this crossroads represents,
it is the glamour and the spangles of Hollywood
Yes... I do not see the panels of Hollywood.
It is where?
You cannot see it because
of something of very dangerous,
because of the air which we breathe.
It is the pollution which blocks us the sight
who is more dangerous than all it with
what the media frighten us.
At the moment when we left the crossroads,
several helicopters appeared in the sky,
and a few seconds later
the chains the tele one appeared too.
What occurs here?
- I thought that you would know it.
I know anything the whole.
- an unspecified type with a weapon.
I do not know any more.
But not of action, not of camera.
One bars oneself for another business.
- Which?
One almost drowned.
- One drowned?
One almost drowned.
And the fact that because of pollution
one does not see any more the mounts of Hollywood?
Thus make a report above.
- On pollution? I could do it.
One sees really nothing any more.
If you must choose between an armed man
and a child who drowns,
you would go where?
- See the armed man.
All is finished here?
Not yet.
Await the sergeants here,
they have all the details.
I arrived at L. A. today and
I cannot see the letters of Hollywood...
since the crossroads.
Because of the air pollution.
You cannot stop somebody
to have polluted the air?
At all.
- Nobody?
Not.
- Why not?
Why not, sergeant?
For more than 10 years, there has been an emission
with the American TV which joins together
systematically Black and White,
and endeavours to decrease our fears and to celebrate
our multiple cultural facets.
This emission is called "COPS"
I returned visit to the ex Co-producer of "Cops"
and producer of "World Wildest Organizes Videos",
M. Dick Hurland.
You will find me in
dictionary under the term of liberal.
Why you do not make
a emission-spectacle,
who would concentrate
on the reasons for the crimes,
and not on the continuation of the criminals?
Because it is complicated. I do not know
of what the air such an emission should have.
The rage, hatred and violence
that is sold well...
The tolerance, comprehension and the desire
to change, not as well.
You want to say the TV rating?
- Yes.
Perhaps because us, with television
there is tendency to sataniser
Blacks and the Hispanic ones,
the televiewers say themselves:
"These people-there, I do not help them!
I hate them,
they want to make me evil."
You include/understand?
Yes, but I do not believe
that one does that.
I do not know if one satanise
Blacks and the Hispanic ones.
I believe that they are not presented
not as much as that as criminals...
But they are it probably more.
In any case one does not test
consciously of the sataniser.
One shows them with television...
like people inspiring the fear.
Yes. Me also I would like
to see under another angle.
I...
Let us begin this evening!
The problem, it is that I do not know
how such a history is told
If I were intelligent enough for that.
- I give you a council.
Call your emission
"Cops of company"
The idea is good but that would be
not a good tele-reality,
Except if one sees these people
in their large motors,
who flee the police force at any speed.
But any American,
who has an unspecified job,
would like to surely see its head
without shirt continued in the street,
and thrown with ground.
That, that gives TV rating!
If I found the unit of police force
who can continue in an adequate way
criminals of company,
and which would be after them...
That wants to say that if one of them steals a bag to hand,
containing 85 dollars, is condemned,
it should have a consequently fine,
he which stole 85 million dollars
with the needy one.
Undoubtedly one could film that!
But if the police force catches that
who stole 85 million,
it it traîte like a city council man
that it is perhaps besides,
and there it is not the tele captivating one.
If you arrive to
what it removes its shirt,
and its portable throws on the police force,
and that it jumps by the window
you hold your spectacle.
In Canada, the violence which one sees with tele
it is known that it does not take place in the street.
Here, it is known that that really occurs.
I do not know the difference,
but I know that there is large.
- Why that does not take place in Canada?
Why there is not over there
10 000 per annum dead?
No idea, but when I would be with the retirement,
I would like to go there, that has the ideal air.
I would like to know the difference,
not you?
If, I will try to know it.
Where should be to you in this moment?
At the school.
You are not afraid to miss queque thing?
- Nan, it is me whom assistance rather the others,
blow, I hardly manage to work.
You do not have a concern for your formation?
- Ben, I have books.
With your opinion, why one has
all these murders in America?
No idea. They must be hated
or something like that.
Not Canadians?
If, but nobody is killed
to be avenged.
You do what then?
- One makes it shit.
And one fout of him.
- One launches eggs to him.
How much murder with Sarnia this year?
No.
- last year?
One, I believe.
And the year of front?
- I do not remember it more...
One only the latter 3 years?
- Probably.
Very little for this city.
Of course step of murder with
only 70. 000 inhabitants.
And it is the capital of the kiss.
Then I went in another Canadian city,
5 times larger than Sarnia:
Windsor in Ontario.
It is just opposite Strait
on the other side of the river.
There, there will be surely more murder.
You already intended to speak about a murder
by weapon with fire with Windsor?
There already were murders here?
It did one, but that a long time of it there.
How long?
During your life?
- Yes. There is 15 or 20 years, there was a murder.
This police officer of Windsor said to me that
only the 3 last years murder
which it remembered,
it was that of a guy of killed Strait
with a weapon stolen in Minnesota.
Almost 400. 000 inhabitants of Windsor,
there was not only one Canadian
to kill some another.
I found that it was time to find
some refreshing facts on Canada.
I went in the streets of New York to know
what the average American thought...
our peaceful neighbors of north.
Canadian does not look at as much
films violent one that Americans.
They is false.
In all the country, hordes of young people
Canadians wait, impatient,
next "the blood bath" of Hollywood.
The guy sees himself tearing off the leg by a shot.
- There were also many girls...
Hardly vêtues, even sometimes naked.
- Very exciting.
What you saw like film?
- A the paddle of the 6th day.
With Arnold Schwarzenegger?
It is for that that you are
if impassioned for this play?
Ben yes... yes.
There is not as much poverty over there...
that in the USA.
They is still false.
We have a stronger rate of unemployment.
When Michigan had 4%, there were 9 of them.
The rate remains irremovable.
In Canada, the population is
primarily white.
Hum, strange.
When I go to Canada, I see Blacks everywhere.
And of the yellows, and the mongrels.
13% of the population are not White.
Then the Canadians resemble to us enough.
Then the reason why if little murder
take place over there, must reside in the fact...
that they have few weapons with fire.
Which kind of weapons you have?
- I am hunter.
Rifles, rifles of hunting, guns.
That done how many weapons in all?
- A little close seven.
You have a weapon with fire?
- Several.
How much?
- Six.
How many of your knowledge
weapons have?
Two, three, a dozen?
- More.
Here, many people have weapons.
It is an immense country and here,
hunting and fishing are of tradition.
In "a little less" of 30 million
inhabitants in Canada,
there are about 10 million families
and wholesale 7 million weapons.
That then! Canada is a friendly country,
impassioned of weapons and super armed.
Where one finds weapons here?
- Everywhere in the city.
You have a badge "GLOCK".
Where I can have one in Canada of them?
In the majority of arms manufacture,
if you have a gun licence...
And now I show you what a foreigner,
in spite of a strict law on the wearing of weapons,
could buy in the local "Wal-Mart".
Where are the ammunition?
- ammunition? By-there.
What you want?
- balls.
Exactly.
I could have, in Canada, as much
ammunition which I want.
You accept the American dollars?
You lock the door on your premise?
- Not.
You have particular fears?
Not really.
You close with key the night?
Really not?
You are not afraid of nothing?
- makes some, not.
You were already burglarized?
- Yes.
What occurred?
I was not at the house when it arrived.
They flew of alcohol and the cigarettes
and set out again.
Probably teenagers
who wanted to have fun a little.
Just of alcohol and the cigarettes.
You were already victim
of a crime?
Which kind of crime?
People entered at home
while I slept,
they devastated my house
and flew of the things.
And you do not close nevertheless
your door with key?
- Not.
As an American with 3 locks
on my door, I was diverted.
Even in the city to million Toronto,
the inhabitants do not lock their door.
Why you do not close
your doors with key like us?
You are afraid of your neighbors.
The night, you leave your door
not-closed?
Where you live?
Here.
- A Toronto?
And you do not lock your door?
The Americans think...
that the locks prevent the others from entering.
Us, the Canadians have feels imprisoned
when one closes the doors.
And you do not want it?
- Not.
One does not want...
Non.
I went, without being announced, in a district
from Toronto to see whether it were true,
this history of doors.
Excuse me, I wanted just to see.
Nobody closes.
Nobody closes with key in this country?
- I would have?
Not, not.
You, you like to live here?
- Yes, I like much.
And the Tee-shirt?
- And the Tee-shirt too.
Your door was large open.
You are not afraid?
Of what?
- No idea.
Not, I am not afraid.
Thank you very much.
- No problem.
Excuse me for my intrusion.
- No problem.
And thank you, not to have drawn me above.
- No problem.
It should well be said: For an American like me,
all that seemed to me quite strange.
Until the moment when, in a bar, I live
with tele the kind of current events
who were diffused.
They are our friends,
we will listen to them attentively
but not will not enter in war,
just because somebody said that to us.
The Canadians are not impregnated
of fear every evening.
And their politicians tell
odd tricks.
They need nurseries for the children,
old people's homes for their parents,
and of a sytème of sickness insurance,
not all to lose because
too large medical expenses.
Thus one builds a good company.
One can only gain all together
and not when one fights against people without defense.
In America, this false idea continues
unfortunately of many governments of right-hand side.
One worries those which cannot be defended,
and one helps financially and one decreases the taxes
those which do not need any at all.
Where are the needy ones in this city?
The needy ones...
You hear this word for the first time?
We do not have this problem here.
I requested it to lead me at least towards
an American poor district.
Good, then here of what the air a ghetto in Canada has.
This also in the mentality of a Canadian is,
to think that a person which falls sick,
must profit from medical care?
- It is sure.
Why?
Because!
- It is one of the humans right, who to live.
You hardly return from the Urgencies?
- Yes.
How much cost you the care?
I do not know,
it is my insurance which pays.
You did not have anything to pay?
- Not.
I have of the family in the United States.
They moved of Canada over there.
It is completely different over there.
- people are more apprehensive.
Yes, it is that.
People always surréagissent, over there.
They do not reflect front.
They leave the weapons immediately:
"Leave my property!"
I do not know,
it is very different here.
You live where?
- A Strait?
And the evening you leave while going to Canada?
People, here, are more open, friendlier.
What one feels to come here?
Be sincere.
It is more pleasant.
The barrier of the races is marked much
in the United States.
It is felt.
Here, one can right being oneself.
- Yes, the Canadians are like that.
With the tele one, with US, one speaks that murder,
shootings and of violence.
I think that with US one tries all to regulate
with violence.
When there is a problem in a country
they send troops to fight.
Whereas in Canada one negotiates
or one seeks another solution.
The United States says:
"One kills to you and one will have peace."
If the fact of having more weapons
more safety gave people,
the USA would be the country
surest of the world.
But it is the opposite.
Genesee County 911.
"I have a pupil of the Buell school
who was wounded by ball.
I need an ambulance immediately."
"Where is the girl?"
"By ground, in my class. Oh my God!
It becomes white."
"It becomes white?"
"the small girl becomes white"
"It still breathes?"
"Not!"
"Where is the child who drew, Madam?"
"It is in the office"
"Where it was touched?"
"I do not know.
I do not dare to turn over it."
"My God! My God! My God!"
I heard the emergency call to television.
It was terrible.
It always shouted:
"It is dying, help me!"
And the small girl was in it?
- Yes, by ground.
Then the police force and the helps came?
- When the helps came,
they took the loading case.
It said:"Leave all."
As soon as the police force and the helps were there,
nobody had anything any more to say.
It was still in life?
- Its lips were already blue.
In my birthplace Flint, Michigan,
a 6 year old schoolboy
with the CP of the primary school Buell,
had found a weapon with fire in his/her uncle,
at which it lived,
because his/her mother had been expelled.
It had brought the weapon to the school,
and a pupil of CP had killed also,
Kayla Roland, âgéé 6 years old.
Touched by a ball, it fell on the ground and died
while its teacher called the police force.
Nobody knew why the boy
wanted to kill the small girl.
This city, which during the 20 last years
had lived enough horrors and tragedies,
blow still a new record beat
younger killer by ball
in a school in the USA.
The morning of the shooting, one should not
that 30 minutes with the helicopters of the media
to arrive on the spot.
Several hundreds of people are awaited
this evening, for the funeral service.
They cry small Kayla
who liked the pizza pies and Nounours,
and which left too much early.
Hello. The funeral parlor
distribute hundreds of these pink ribbons,
as a sign of condolence.
It is one day moving,
where we commemorate the memory of Kayla.
Jeff Rossen de Fox 2.
Good job!
Yes, I know,
we have technical problems!
Then, it car-satellite calls!
I must see a hairdresser,
I resemble a pig.
One goes there.
Many does not find their words yet.
The funeral will take place with 19h00.
On line of Flint/Michigan,
Jeff Rossen for Q13.
Mercy.
You want lacquer?
- That would be probably better.
I have some...
- I have some too.
I have gel "anti-tornadoes".
This man requested for Kayla,
he released a balloon for it.
Ah, we received the photograph colors...
Here, we have the same ones
average techniques that in Columbine.
Certain chains travel thus
of tragedy in tragedy.
I have sorrow for them,
they do not see anything other.
That tragedies.
We make so that it is
loan for the newspaper of 17h00.
Today we provide CNN and Fox.
The national media had never come
at the Buell school, not more than in the district
Beecher, of which it formed part,
not more than in this district of Flint.
Only some journalists present took
the sorrow to come up to now.
If they had taken the risk to move away
of some streets of the school
or of the mortuary, they would have...
considering another tragedy and perhaps have
some answers on the death of small.
During more than 20 years, this district
impoverished in the city of the registered office
of one of the largest boxes,
was completely ignored and destroys.
87% of the schoolboys here live under the threshold
official of poverty.
Buell and Beecher and Flint did not return
in the fairy tale, spread by the media,
which everyone believed readily...
large America and
of its invincible economy.
The cause of dead most frequent in the young people,
in this part of Flint, it is the homicide.
The football field of Beecher
became a company of burial.
The kids of Beecher gained 13 times
regional championships of race to foot.
But they never had competition
at the house, because all around the ground
of football was only mud and dirtinesses.
A few years ago, somebody named
all streets of this district
by names of universities of elites,
Like dreaming of days and one
life better.
The children held out.
The too teaching body.
But we cannot forget.
We do not forget.
It is not necessary any more that that arrives...
I know.
Me either,
I do not want any more that that arrives.
That goes, that goes.
I am sorry.
That will go.
Of my cold and dead hands
As it had done
after the massacre of Columbine,
Charlton Heston came to make its show
for the weapons, in Flint.
Freedom never was as much in danger,
that was never also significant,
to defend oneself, that now.
Before coming in Flint, Heston was questioned in
the newspaper of Georgetown "The Hoya",
in connection with the death of Kayla.
And even its site of the NRA is occupied.
We want to let know that the NRA
Kayla did not forget.
How can they come here?
I am shocked and furious.
A local journalist asked Heston why
he came in Flint after the tragedy from Buell,
And what the NRA thought the small ones
6 year old boys armed.
We give each year
21 million dollars,
to inform the 6 year old boys:
"If you see a weapon,
does not touch it.
Leave the part.
Warn an adult."
And then Moïse made its show.
Here In Flint?
- Here In Flint.
There it had people to push you
to introduce the child in front of the court?
People of all America have me
writing, called, mailé.
I found that incredible,
that groups,
sympathizers of the NRA,
people whom I call "nutcases of weapons",
come to say to me that that was terrible,
that it is necessary that people do not bring
of weapons in their house.
They wanted that this boy is
hung with the most tree.
All this wave of hatred, racism...
It was ugly.
This drawing was made by the small one
boy who drew in Buell,
approximately 15 minutes after its act.
I gave him pencils to occupy it.
It drew this for me.
There were other drawings on this wall,
and he wanted, also, to make some to him for me.
It has says what that represents?
It is its house.
- It is him, in its house, there?
Why you put it aside?
Because of the weight of the events,
and because he wanted
that I hang it.
I framed it
and it remains here.
Tamarla Owens is the mother of small
6 year old boy.
To be able to look after and obtain
food for his/her children,
It was to take part in a program of
work instead of the social assistance.
This program made it possible to make disappear
so much of the poor of the social assistance
that its inventor, Gerald Miller, has
soon engaged by a firm to adapt it...
with the majority of the other social systems
privatized federal States.
This firm is Lockheed Martin.
As there was no more enemy
to fear after the cold war,
Lockheed found the average ideal
to benefit from the fear of people.
The enemy was just a little nearer.
The poor black mothers, like Tamarla Owens.
A mother raising only her children,
and having 80 km of way to go to work,
How the community can help it?
But thus the State wants responsabiliser
parents...
"Work instead of a social help".
This program must be stopped.
It does not have any positive effect.
It worsens only the problems.
- Really?
It is what you think as Shériff?
- Yes.
I would like that in each family,
there are 2 responsible parents,
but it is impossible.
We set up it
single-parent bus,
In this manner, they can go
to gain 5. 50 $ of the hour anywhere.
This bus was to take it each morning,
to pay its social debt while working.
With much of other people, Flint.
It went tous. les. jours in Arbor Hills in
county of Oakland, one of the areas
richest of the country.
Tamarla left the morning early,
and the evening returned late to the house.
It saw hardly her children.
And what that gives?
Which that benefits, in the State, or Flint?
A child died.
That could belong to the problem.
One sends the relative far.
If somebody affirms here,
that that serves the community,
I can only shake the head.
You travel by this bus since how long?
Approximately 3 years.
My brother works here.
Half of my vicinity works here.
Almost all people whom I know
work in this shopping centre.
I would have a starvation wage,
in Flint, for same work.
I make 60 km to gain 3 $
hour in more.
It is what, the hourly wage, here?
- 8,50 $.
That pays your invoices?
- Not.
You knew Tamarla, the mother
the small one which killed the girl?
It took this bus.
- I knew it a little,
not very well.
- It was nice?
It was clear, it did its work.
It had 2 jobs.
2 jobs?
- Yes.
It is here, in Dick Clark' S Band Grill
that Tamarla carried out its 2 jobs.
Here, it worked as barmaid.
It prepared drinks,
shakes and made the desserts.
It was a good employee?
- Yes.
It also worked in
pastry making of at side.
Your employment is assigned by the State.
Dick Clark is an icon American.
The man who gave us of Rock' Roll
every week.
One connects each part of the life
with the music.
As Dick said:"music
is the B. O. of our life."
For its restaurant and the pastry making of Arbor Hills
he asked specific tax advantages,
because it employed recipients
of the social assistance.
Tamarla worked 70h per week
in its two employment but,
it did not gain enough to pay the rent.
And a week before the shooting, its owner
he learned that it was going to expel it.
Being without lodging and not being laid out with
to withdraw his/her two children of the school,
it asked her brother if it could
to place at his place for a few weeks.
There, the son of Tamarla found a small gun
gauge 32 that it brought to the school.
Tamarla did not see that it took along
the gun at the school,
because it was in the bus, to go on the way
to prepare drinks and pastry makings for the rich person.
I decided to return to me to California
to ask Dick Clark...
what it retained of a system which obliged
the poor black mothers to find...
two jobs underpaid to survive.
I carry out documentary on the weapons
and shootings in the schools.
In my birthplace, Flint, Michigan,
that you know,
a six year old child drew
on another six years also.
Go up, Dave!
Caution!
We are late.
In any case, the mother of
victim worked...
with the grill of Dick Clark in Oakland County.
- Drops. Firm the door.
Ah this program of professional reintegration...
- the door!
...force these people... Not, Dick!
- Hello.
You must help me to convince
the governor of Michigan...
These women were forced
to work...
They have children at the house...
Dick! Eh, guy!
In America de George Bush
the poor were already not a priority.
And after 11 September 2001, the problems social
were relegated still a little further
by the fear and new priorities.
Let us show our unit,
while treating in priority with the Congress...
military questions
and the defense of the USA,
and by financing my claims.
We sell many combinations
with gloves and hood.
And much of gas masks.
I take some for me
and for my dog.
Dennis Marks and his wife
made reserves:
weapons, ammunition.
At Wal-Mart the sales of weapons have
increased by 70% since September 11,
sales of ammunition of 140%.
In Dallas, one used targets
with the effigy of Ben Laden.
In the months which followed on September 11
the fear étreignait us, us them American.
Nobody knew if it went him too
to die with the hand of the criminal,
or if it had sat beside insane which went
suddenly to put fire at its shoe.
The threat seemed real.
It is probably of paranoia,
but I do not want to take any risk.
I will protect my family.
Our increasing fear was
for much a good bargain.
Mike Blake installed 30% of alarms
in more since one month.
It thinks that people are always
shaken by the attack of September 11.
Why are afraid so much?
Because many lives about it,
and make career gràce with it.
There is an interest growing...
to maintain to us in this fear,
and much of efforts are devoted there.
The best way of fighting terrorists
armed with cutters, it is to order...
a record number of fighters at Lockheed.
Yes, all were reassured. Especially when
the army collected the refuse on Park Avenue.
But the principal advantage of one
terrorized public opinion,
they is that the political leaders and
economic draw some cheaply.
I do not know a better example...
of a government self-service...
that the administration Bush and Enron.
I did not know large thing afterwards
the attack of World Trade Center.
But a thing was clear: before or
after September 11, a population...
that the fear returned at this unverifiable point
was to have neither weapons nor ammunition in the vicinity.
One drew on me with Tech 9.
9 mm?
It east appears it semi-automatic,
but it seemed to to me completely automatic.
Here Richard Castaldo.
and it is to him Mark Taylor.
Both were victims
massacre of Columbine.
Richard is paralysed for the remainder of his days
and condemned to the wheelchair.
After many operations, Mark could not
to rise that with sorrow.
The pupils of Columbine were punished.
This day we have
summer punished for the whole nation.
Mark and Richard were condemned to the infirmity.
They always suffer from the balls
to 17 hundreds of K-Mart
who are still in their bodies.
As they showed me the impacts of the balls
it came me an idea on the way of reducing,
the number of weapons and balls which trail.
I asked the young boys if they would not like
not to go to K-Mart to bring back the goods.
Loan?
Go ahead.
- Me? Of agreement.
Cut the camera, please!
We would like to speak to Mr. Conaway.
I must initially ask for one
authorization to film.
Cuts it.
One hour later
I am Mary Lorencz,
director of the communication of K-Mart.
What can I make for you?
- Then, it is to him Richard Castaldo.
Hello, Richard.
And here Taylor Mark.
They are high-school pupils with Columbine.
At the time of the attack they were
touched by balls of K-Mart.
That gone on a long journey
from Colorado.
I said myself...
since you do not sell any more a weapon,
it would be logical of more,
to sell balls either.
We ask that you stop
completely the sale of balls of 9 mm.
You know K-Mart, you are, I hope,
customers on our premises and you know that us...
let us not make that the sporting weapons
and accessories for hunting.
We will transmit your request
with president, Chuck Conaway.
It is not there today.
- Not?
Not, not there of the week.
- At all?
There is a limit with the number of balls
that a person can buy?
I cannot answer.
I am not the person in charge for the purchases...
It is there?
I can get information for you
if you leave your chart.
We do not want to leave chart,
here are what it is:
Mark took a K-Mart ball
to 2,5 cm of the aorta.
Between the aorta and the spinal column.
Still happy that you can
to always hold you upright.
I said to you,
that somebody will listen to you
and that one takes with serious the your requests.
It is not somebody of the public relations,
but an authorized person
who brings an answer
with your questions.
K-Mart takes that with serious, but I
can nothing make moreover for the moment.
I must pass from the telephone calls...
I will see then if there is
somebody of the purchases.
Mary went up.
And two hours later it returned
with the type which buys the balls for K-Mart.
I advise you to avoid the troubles.
It is not we who have troubles.
Mark showed him its wounds.
They are the holes left by your balls.
It is by there that returned the K-Mart balls.
Goodbye.
Will someone else go down?
Or it is all?
I will see.
- Thank you.
We still waited a few hours
but nobody any more is descended.
As we left the building,
Mark had an idea.
It proposed to go in
K-Mart nearest
to repurchase all the balls.
Take as much as you can.
They are there at side.
What there is of other?
You have balls of 357 magnum?
I take them to you all.
You are 17 years old. And you?
- 16 years.
Shit!
Mark repurchased all the ammunition.
The following day we are turned over with
all balls with the head office of K-Mart.
This time we had prevented the press.
The Last News of Michigan
South-east continue.
The following report/ratio warns against
snakes for this summer...
and a mother shows who was bitten
by a rattlesnake.
The pupils who survived the massacre
of Columbine are downtown.
They are furious against K-Mart.
We would like to speak
with president de K-Mart.
How that is?
- Happy to re-examine you.
Here balls of 9 mm.
These balls are still in...
bodies of Richard and Mark.
Take them.
I will not touch there.
Leave, somebody will come.
And do not block the door, please.
You send somebody?
I am Laurie McTavish, vice-president
of K-Mart in load of the communication.
I would like to bring to you
explanations in the name of the company.
What arrived at Columbine, in Colorado,
is a tragedy which touches all the Americans.
That afflicts me that this young man
a damage underwent.
K-Mart gradually will give up
the sale of ammunition for weapons with fire.
We envisage a complete stop...
in the United States
within 90 days.
Representatives of K-Mart
met Mr. Moore yesterday...
and pupils of Columbine,
they heard the recriminations
on the market products by K-Mart.
Following this meeting,
the company promised...
to propose a solution
within one week.
First of all we would like to thank you...
not to sell ammunition more
in your stores.
And in 90 days...
-... this process will be completed.
And in 90 days there will not be
more ammunition for weapons with fire?
One will not sell any more ammunition
for weapons with fire in our stores.
That pleases enormously to us.
Thank you very much, it is really super.
I am sawn!
It is more than what we ask.
Really astonishing.
You would have believed it?
- Not.
We had already
to turn over to the airport.
The pupils of Columbine gained
a bright victory counters K-Mart.
And I was motivated to make
what I had to do.
For that I needed a plan
houses of stars.
M. Heston?
Here Michael Moore.
The realizer.
- Ah yes, of course.
How you are?
- Well, thank you.
I wanted to ask to you whether I
could maintain me with you.
We turn documentary...
on the question of the weapons.
I am member of the NRA.
Could we speak a little?
I will look in my diary.
Perhaps I would have a moment tomorrow.
I have visit in this moment.
And how...
Forgiveness?
Do not leave.
- Yes, thank you.
I would have a moment well tomorrow morning.
Thursday, it is that?
With 8h30.
- Tomorrow morning?
Here?
Very well.
The next morning.
Michael Moore,
I have appointment with Charlton Heston.
How you are?
Thank you to receive me.
It led me in its house with
swimming pool and tennis in order to chatter a little.
I told him that I was member with life
NRA and I showed him my chart.
Cheer.
You made well.
You have weapons on your premise?
- Of course.
The criminals feel it.
To defend you?
- Yes, of course.
You were already victim of a crime?
- Not.
You were never attacked?
And in spite of that you have
weapons on your premise?
Charged.
- They are charged?
A weapon of self-defence must
évidemmment to be charged.
Why you need some?
- I do not need any.
Of course, you were never attacked...
- It is exact.
Why you do not discharge
the weapon then?
Because the second amendment
give me the right to charge it.
I agree entirely with you.
I think simply that the amendment...
- I smell myself better like that.
Of knowknowing that you have here
a weapon charged?
It is that,
One can slacken...
I should not have concern.
- And not to be afraid?
I am not afraid...
I exert one of the rights...
establish by the old wise White
who created this country.
What was good for them,
is also for me.
You could also exert this right
with a discharged weapon.
It is my choice.
It seems to to me interesting
that one frequently says,
in connection with other countries which
a death rate does not have
as éIévé as ours,
that they have less weapons.
It is difficult to get
weapons in England or Germany.
But in Canada, there is 7 million
of weapons for 10 million households.
There is little,
today still,
Canada is a country of hunters,
with million weapons, but over there
there were only some deaths last year.
In a country of 30 million inhabitants.
Here my question:
How it is done
that they have as many weapons,
but do not commit suicide in
same proportions as us?
I believe that the American history
much blood has on the hands.
It is not the case of the history
allemande? or English?
Not at this point.
German has less
of blood on the hands?
Not, of course.
English dominated the world
during 300 years by the force of the weapons.
They are brutal people. They have
criminals, crimes, weapons...
It is an interesting point,
that one could analyze,
and you could do it
longitudinally and into broad,
but I do not have anything other to add.
You do not have any idea of
reason for which we are...
the only country in which as much of
people are made draw above?
Today, we probably have
a greater ethnique diversity...
that many of other countries.
You think that it is a ethnique question?
- Not, I will not go until there.
We had sufficient problems
at the beginning with the civic rights.
I on top do not have an answer.
What means "ethnique diversity"?
That, I do not include/understand.
You asked why as much
American between-commits suicide.
I do not know if it is true...
But you know nevertheless that we have
more deaths by weapon with fire than any country.
I can only repeat my answer.
Who was?
That we have one...
history more violent than
majority of the other countries.
Besides that of Russia or Japan.
- And that of Germany.
And that of Germany,
but more violent than that of Canada.
I am of Flint, in Michigan.
Last year, kid a six year old
shot at a girl from her class.
It was a tragedy.
- But they was children.
Yes, two 6 year old children.
You intended some to speak?
Here my question:
after this event,
you came in Flint
to organize a great meeting.
And the vice-president too.
You do not think that that missed
of tact with respect to this city...
Honestly, I did not know anything of it.
We arrive early the morning for...
meeting then we continue
a little further.
You did not know only it
y had had this death?
If you had known it...
-... I would have cancelled?
I... I am not sure.
- But your arrival was not envisaged,
you made the decision of you
to return over there after this dreadful fact.
Would be you come
if you had known?
I do not know.
No idea.
Perhaps not?
Would like you to excuse yourselves for
that near people of Flint?
You would like that I excuse myself
near people of Flint?
Or near the inhabitants of Columbine
for your appearance after the tragedy?
Why you go afterwards of
such tragedies in these cities?
I want to say, I am
member of your organization.
I fear that our
opinions do not differ.
You find normal
to present to you over there?
You find that normal?
M. Heston, still a thing.
Here it is.
It is there.
Here, Mr. Heston,
do not leave please.
Look at it well, please.
It is it the girl.
I left the ground of Heston with Beverly Hills
and dispatched me to turn over in the real world.
In America which saw and
breathe in the fear...
You imagine that somebody,
is introduced on your premise and
evil with your family wants.
What this person could resemble?
With you, it, him, no matter whom.
Perhaps with the caméraman.
...during this time, one sells
more weapons than ever.
It draws also quickly
that semi-automatic.
And this to what leads finally
"Bowling for Columbine".
One shot Sunday at three employees
from Broadway Center Bowling.
I do not know practically anything
on this history.
Only that there were three died.
In Littleton. In the room of Bowling.
My condolences.
- Good day.
Yes, it is one moment of glory
to be American.
