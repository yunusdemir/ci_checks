Whozit who stinks?
Do they ever wash with soap?
Papers say barely 11% of Paris
Apts. have bathrooms
<i>Well, one  can  wash in the sink.
These people don't even try</i>
Maybe a reunion of Paris's
champion stinkeroos?
It's a pure chance
There's no reason to assume that
folks stink any less elsewhere
No reason. But jeez,
what a smell!
What's that stench?
Lady, that's Barbouze,
the perfume by Fior
Oughtta be a law against
stinkin' up the area!
- It's me Zazie! You my Unkie?
-I am indeed your Unkie
-You smell good!
-It's Barbouze by Fior
-Put some on me.
-It's mens perfume
-Hi baby brother
-Hi, Jan
-Thanks for babysitting.
-No sweat. We'll be OK
Meet you here day
after tomorrow...
... the 6:50 a.m. train
-How's the wife?
-Fine. Come visit
Joking? I've no time.
When Mom's got a loverboy,
the family comes 2nd
-She's got it bad
-Let's go
-We gonna take the metro?
-No
-Whadaya mean no?
-I mean no. We got Charles' heap
I've a confession
eatin' my guts,
a True Confession, Confidential!
I'll forego my infancy
No, I ain't free, I'm
waitin' for my buddy
Here's my buddy, Gabriel
Some crumby heap!
If you ain't havin' any...
-Pile in, don't be a snob.
-A snob, my ass!
Your niece is a laugh riot.
Mu God!
<i> STRIKE </i>
-Bastards! To do this to me!
-Not just to you
It is to me! I want to ride
the metro bad!
-Big, big Shit!
-Calm yourself
-When'll the strike end?
-Don't ask me, I'm no politico
T'ain't politics, it's dough
-Ever strike. Mr.?
-To get my fares raised
For this icky old heap, they
oughtta lower your fares!
Paris! A real cool town
Dig that, The Pantheon
-Bull!
-It's not the Pantheon?
No, no, no it's NOT,
the Pantheon
-What then?
-Haven't a clue
-Ask a passerby.
-Passersby are fools!
True enough!
I got it! Your Pantheon
was Notre Dame
Maybe, but it's gone!
Let's drop it
Kid, how's that for a cool
piece of architecture?
Napoleon's tomb
You're way out in left field!
That's the police barracks
Are you trying to be funny?
...to make you laugh, my child
Truth is, he means
to be funny
Don't think you can make fun of
me, you beat-up old fools!
That's your Beat Generation!
Take your Beat and...
If you really-wanna-see
the REAL tomb...
...of the REAL Napoleon,
then I'll take you
Napoleon, my ass. That old
creep and his sad-sack hat
So, what interests you?
THE METRO!
Metro. There's your metro!
The Metro. The Super-Metro!
-It's the El.
-And not the metro?
I'll explain
Sometimes the metro
comes up for air
Bull! You never
tell the truth
Truth! Waht do you, what does
anyone know about Truth?
The Pantheon, Napoleon's
tomb, the Notre Dame...
...It's all bullshit!
What a pity!
What a pity!
-There! Whazzat?
-Who knows
Watch the birdie; he bites
Mr. Charles, you're
1 sad apple
Sad apple, my ass!
That does it!
I don't want a foul-mouthed slut
in my house talking dirty,
and perverting the neighborhood!
<i> Yackety-yak, that's
all you guys can do </i>
Soup's on
-Ah, consomme!
-Don't push it
So, little one, Are we
tired? Are we sleepy?
Who's we?
We's you
What time do you sack-out
at home?
Home and this pad is
different, I hope
Are you saying yes or
do you mean yes?
See, Albertine, how kids
reason at her age!
-Why bother with school?
- I wanna go to school till I'm 65.
- Till you're 65?
Yes, I wanna be a teacher
Good job! Great benefits
Benefits, my ass? It's
not for the benefits
Then why teach?
To piss off the li'l brats!
In 50 years, 100, 1000 years, I'll
still have li'l brats to piss off!
I'll make 'em chew erasers
I'll jab compasses in
their fat behinds
I'll kick their bottoms
I'll wear boots with spurs
to tenderize their meat!
According to what newspapers
say on modern education,
schools are on a kindness kick,
Stressing sweetness, gentility
and understanding
Doesn't it say so
in the papers?
Right! Were they mean
to you at school?
That'd be the day!
In 20 years, there'll be
no more teachers
They'll be replaced by movies,
TV, electronics, and the like
This was also in the papers
Isn't that right, Albertine?
Then, I'll be an astronaut!
-That's got a future
-I'll piss off the Martians!
Kid thinks big
You game for a movie?
Have to be on the
job at 11:00
I'll go with Auntie
No dice! She never goes
out without me
Smooth skin
She fell right off to sleep
But tomorrow...
Don't let her wake me!
Kids roll out of
the sack early
But I need my beauty sleep...
10 hours, are essential
<i> Yackety-yak, that's
all you guys can do </i>
Yak, my ass!
Come again?
I said, "Yak yak,
my ass." Ow!
What do you mean by that?
What I mean is, I don't
like that kid around
Like her or lump her...
that's hard cheese for you
Gettin' wise, like
your niece?
There's a law against
sub-fools like you
Know what a sub-fool is,
you sub-fool?
- Yes!
- What then?
It means your language stinks
You're getting on my nerves
I won't have that brat
in this house!
How's that?
I won't have that
little sucker...
Can't we get any sleep
around here?
What's this mess?
<i> Yackety-yak... </i>
<i> ...that's all you guys can do </i>
- It's a goner
- I'll buy you a new one
Thanks, but not in pigskin
Name it, then...
Kid?
Sharkskin?
Russian leather?
Lizard?
Crocodile!
It's expensive
but chic
Your Aunt is so sweet
<i>And him. What's  he
doin' here?</i>
He's the landlord, an A-1
Landlord, a buddy,
- 1 sweet guy.
- Sweet, my ass
I hear her "My ass"!
- Go on, and don't talk dirty
- T'ain't me, it's her!
Squealer!
Gabriel, you forgot
your lipstick
Li'l one!
Come here! Hurry up!
Where are you going? Come
back here right now!
Come back right away!
Help! Help! I don't want
to go with that man!
I don't know him!
- He told me "things..."
- What?
The kid's running away.
I'm taking her home
- Tell what the nasty man said.
- I don't dare
What'd he want?
Dis-gusting!
- What DID he want?
- Never heard tell of that one
Incredible!
- Some folks are real S.O.B.'s!
- What'd he say?
I don't get it
Know what my husband
dreamed up one day?
We tried to one time...
No idea where he got that one...
Get lost, Jack, I says
to my husband...
Jeez, I've never
been so scared
That'll teach you
Well, it didn't kill you
The kid took off!
The kid took off!
The kid took off?
- They thought me a lech!
- Get jitters?
It was worse than bombs!
Bombs! They never scared me,
as long as they were British
I wasn't scared either
Result: they never hit me
I got a big bang out of
those fireworks. Boom!
There goes a munitions
dump!
A station blown sky high!
- A factory in smithereens!
- Paris burning. What a show!
The good old days!
Whassamatter kiddie,
feelin' blue?
That bad eh?
Poor itty-bitty kiddie
Do your folks beat you?
You lost something and are
afraid to tell them
- Tell me. You can trust me
- Why should I?
'Cuz I love little
boys and girls
- Then you are an old lech!
- Absolutely not
During the German occupation,
I was screwing up 6 ways
'til Sunday
Germans, controls, fines,
requisitions. Never any luck!
Thank God I inherited this joint.
Quit bitchin'!
- What's this?
- Flea Market
Where Rembrandts are dirt cheap
for resale to Americans?
Not just Rembrandts. Shoes.
Lavender. Tacks.
- And G.I. surplus?
- Yes, and real good french fries
I love G.I. surplus
They got mussels, guaranteed
non-poisonous
They got blue-jeans?
Sure, and compasses, too
Who cares! I want blue-jeans
Let's go see
I don't trust you!
Got any jeans for the kid?
I'll get them
<i> CLEARANCE SALE </i>
These'll never wear out
Big deal! In a year
she'll outgrow 'em
- For a kid brother?
- Got none
- In a year, who knows?
- No way. Her mom's dead
Say, I'm sorry...
Let me get it straight. Why are
kids jeans G.I. surplus?
The Americans had kids
in their army?
Sure. Takes all kinds
to fight a war
How much for these?
I throw 'em in free
with the jeans
Hungry, kiddie? What say
you to some mussels?
- Or french fries?
- Both
Wine
Impossible!
You sure slop it up
slower than my Pop
He'd have put away 10
- Your Pa drinks alot?
- He did! He croaked
Really? Were you very sad
when he died?
- Joking? With what went on!
- What went on?
Hustle the mussels!
Remember? Housewife Hacks
Hubby with Hatchet?
You don't read the news?
Get you, tryin' to talk
it up with me!
So, the Housewife was Mom
Naturally, the Hubby was Pop
It made the front page. Mom
got a bit-shot lawyer,
from Paris... a real idiot.
But he got her off
Everybody cheered Mom
Damn near gave
her a medal
- Are you interested?
- Not particularly
Hypocrite!
Come on! Don't pout, I'll
tell you the story...
Mom could not stand Pop
so Pop was sad and
began drinking
You with it?
It happened last year...
A Sunday in October,
I had just returned
from football...
<i> Pop was all alone in the house...</i>
<i>...All alone, waiting...</i>
<i>...Waiting for nothing special...</i>
<i>...Just waiting... </i>
So I come in
Pop is drunk as a skunk
He starts to kiss me
So what? He's my Pop
That was incredible
Then the door opens slowly
You see, Mom had told him...
"I'm leaving to buy
spaghetti and pork"
But she was lying. Pretty
smart, eh?
So she oozes in, real quiet
Pop wasn't paying attention! That's
how mom sent him to heaven
Still, mom got off the hook
With congrats, yet
Don't you think that
takes the cake?
Help!
I don't want to go with that
man! I don't know him!
- He said 'things'
- What?
Li'l thief!
She swiped them blue-jeans
from my shop
- Bad kid!
- What a shame!
She never learned that
property is sacred?
What if I took you
to the cops?
They'd throw you in jail
Pity on this child, sir
It's not her fault she's
underprivileged
Don't blame her. Hunger
made her do it
Haven't you ever been
hungry?
Hungry? Lady, I myself
am an ex-orphan
We'll see what your folks say
Unkie, a cop wants
to talk to you
You're a copper?
Me? I'm a poor peddler
Pedro Surplus, they call me
Don't buy it. He's a cop
Gag a minute, this kid
Don't talk without a lawyer
She thinks I'm a dope
No respect for her elders
This is all bull.
I'd rather go
So you live by exploiting
little girls?
Me?
The kid was working the
Flea Market
What's your occupation?
Entertainer
The kid claims you're
a night watchman
A white lie
What... type of entertainer?
- Spanish ballerina
- I see. So you are...
<i>Of course not. I do a skit
in a skirt in a nightclub,</i>
<i>strictly for laffs</i>
<i>With my waist, you see?</i>
<i>Aha! Sodomy, presbyterianism,
and homosexuality!</i>
- What's a hormosexual?
- A man who wears blue-jeans
Bull!
Take that off!
No. They're mine!
Kick him out!
What if he's a copper?
So what?
<i>Love can flower at 1st sight</i>
I have a few questions
for Madame
Shoot
Occupation?
Housewife?
Which means...?
Which means, for instance,
dumping the garbage
One burger
Hello, Charles. Lunch
with us?
- Thought it was all set.
- Just reminding you
I ain't forgotten
I'm confirming!
Why confirm it? It's set
Hurry up, let's eat!
<i>23 MINUTES LATER</i>
So what's this guy saying?
Nothing
He's eating?
- Boy can he eat!
- Did he start with sardines?
Same as you
- And to drink?
- Dago red
- How much?
- Half a bottle
My plate! What're
you thinking?
I'm thinking of Charles
Serious hunk of man...
He has a good job,
makes good money!
He's not too old and
not too young!
He's good-looking, healthy...
Thrifty
A real dream boat!
Trouble is, he's too romantic
Got a shoelace? I
just popped one
I'm closed, come back at 2
- Ain't these laces?
- Hands off, mister!
You can't refuse me a lace.
It ain't human
Don't cry to soften me up!
Cop! Lecher!
Insults; the thanks I get for
bringing her back to her folks
- And What folks!
- What's wrong with 'em?
- Her Unkie's a...
- Drop dead!
Who gives orders
to whom?
Gabriel's a good citizen. We like
him. He's got sex appeal
Cut it out!
- Gabriel's O.K.
- Prove it
- He's married.
- Proves nothin'
Henri III was married, too;
to Louise de Vaudemont
That dame was Queen of France?
Why you bird-doggin'
'round here anyway?
I restored a lost kid
to her family
And now it's me who's lost
The metro's that-a-way
You don't understand. I've
lost My Self
- What do you mean?
- Like, ask me anything
Ask me my name, maybe
O.K. Name?
I haven't a clue
- I never learned it by heart
- Why learn a name by heart?
- What's yours?
- Gridoux
See, you memorized yours
You're right
I don't even know if I
ever had a name
Impossible!
It ain't possible to say
it ain't possible
- And how old are you?
- Search me
When I'm asked what
I do, you know!
It's not that I don't want
to say, but...
Yes, of course
- The metro's still that-a-way?
- This way... that way...
But the metro's on strike!
Paris is coolsville
Beats me why Paris is always
pictured as a lady
What?
I didn't know you
dug good-talk
A sudden strike of genius
Us artists are like that
Take a look at that
The Pantheon, Napoleon's Tomb,
The Follies-Bergeres,
The metro
Jeez. Makes me dizzy
- Ain't that high
- All the same...
- There's Charles' heap!
- Oh, my glasses!
<i> I got a confession eatin'
my guts...</i>
<i>A True Confession,
Confidential!</i>
<i>Forget my childhood.
I was young then</i>
<i>Forget my education. I had
so little of it</i>
<i>As to my military service;
I won't get into it</i>
<i> I am loath to boast of it</i>
<i>A bachelor since birth,</i>

<i>Up, Down... Down, Up</i>
<i>...Over, Under, In, Out...</i>

<i>A dream within a dream...</i>
<i>A dream within a dream!</i>
20 years since I been up
- How old're you?
- Guess
You're pretty beat-up... 25?
- Plus 10
- You don't look it
- How about Unkie?
- He's 32
Looks older
Don't tell him. He'd cry
'Cause he's a hormosexual?
Where'd you get that one?
The copper said so
Not true
Yes, true
I mean, it ain't true
about Gabriel
What makes him hormosexual?
...The perfume?
- You got it.
- That's no crime
- Are you hormosexual?
- Me? A Fairy?
- No, you're a cabbie.
- You see!
I don't see a thing. So, why
ain't you married?
- Never found the one.
- Picky, ain'tcha?
- Would you go for me?
- You're a kid
- Some kids marry at 10
- Do I send you?
Heck no
- You've screwy ideas.
- True. I wonder where I get 'em
<i>Way down below</i>
<i>the graves are slopping over

Gabriel! What's up, Doc?
Where in hell are my Krauts?
No car? Want a lift to Ste.
Chapelle, that Gothic jewel?
No. I'm with Charles.
Good-bye
Answer me!
You're a pain! I don't
like your questions
You just don't know
the answers
- Where were we?
- I ain't the marrying kind
Not all women ask questions,
like me
What're you talking about?
You're a brat!
- 'Scuse me! I menstruate!
- Keep it clean, OK?
- Clean? It's life.
- It's not life
You should know,
in your racket
I heard cabbie's see all
types of sexuality
Cut it out!
That's all you can say!
Boy, you're repressed!
Come back, tell me about it
Whatssamatter? You afraid
of me?
<i>Same routine, sexuality,</i>
<i>same old jazz,</i>
<i>dis-gusting...</i>
<i>They're 1-track minded</i>
- Where're you going?
- I'm takin' off!
- What about us?
- Take the metro!
I've had it with
that brat!
Unkie, I want an ice cream
- Where're we going?
- My rehearsals's at 6
- Grab a cab.
- With the metro strike
- Why'd Charles slink off?
- No reason
- That's no reason.
- He just split.
- Tell me why
That jazz you talk is
too grown-up for him
What if I talk jazz to you?
Try me
Like, are you hormosexual,
answer me, yes or no?
Poor Charles
Answer!
Cutie-pie, you're hurting
the nice man
- You mustn't brutalize adults
- He won't answer me
Is that a reason, lovey?
We should all try to
avoid violence
It's reprehensible
Reprehensible, my ass
Lay off the kid, OK?
- Some educator you are.
- Educator, my ass
She has such a foul mouth!
Mind your own beeswax!
- I've my ideas on education
- Such as?
First, understanding
What about my question, hey?
I've had it with you
Be understanding, now
Are you making a pass
at my Unkie?
He's married
I'm still a virgin, you know
and a widow, to boot
My rehearsal!
I'll never make it
- Unkie, my question...
- Try asking me
- Is he a hormosexual?
- Him? Sure he is
Really!
You're tough on women
Answer her question;
to educate her
You gonna tell me, yes or no?
What's a hormosexual?
Help! Help! Kidnappers!
I won't take that shit!
- Tired?
- No. Dis-gusted
Officer, a man was kidnapped.
A hunk o' man!
Hurry! It's my Unkie!
I got a car. Kidnappers, beware!
- She not such a jerk.
- Most kind of you
Don't mention it
- You done, ladies?
- Who asked you aboard?
- Women! You asked me!
- Words make no sense anymore
That's just like a cop!
And judges are even worse
- They all stink!
- Haven't I seen you before?
I doubt it
- She could be right.
- Most kind, dear
-A pleasure, my dear.
- Too sweet of you
They'll drive me whack-o!
It ain't possible
A cute cop like you
knows a trick or 2
Strictly legal, of course
You'll see what Trouscaillon's
made of!
His name's Trouscaillon!
I'm just plain Mrs Me,
like everyone else!
My rehearsal!
- He's wonderful!
- A sheep
Isn't he cute?
Unkie; the cop: You're
insatiable!
Where's Ste. Chapelle,
that Gothic jewel?
Forget my education...
... I did
As to my military service...
Cpt. Fedor Balanovitch
welcomes you aboard
We are now directly
over the Trocadero
Altitude 5'11''. Airspeed,
6 knots
Left, the Soc. Security Bldg,
apex of out civilization
I can't take it anymore!
I'll try a short cut
Mme., Could you be lost?
The zephyr has wafted us
off our course
And here's the Ste. Chapelle,
that Gothic jewel
Hurry up, it's gonna close!
- He's growing on me...
- She's out to lunch
Your driving is masterful
Your rehearsal WAS at 6:00
Traffic. Did the missus
bring my new dress?
The missus? Man THAT's news!
Put the token on my tab
<i>The # you've dialed is
no longer...</i>
<i>Oh, it's you!</i>
<i>Mado? Run tell Albertine...</i>
<i>- I can't, I'm alone.
- Clients? Boot 'em out</i>
I can't boot Charles.
He's proposing
<i>Congrats. But it's urgent!</i>
- So? Yes or no?
- This is so sudden
I got to think it over
Yes? or no, yet?
Yes
Gabriel? Mado and I...
are engaged
I'm announcin' our nups
No difference, but it
makes screwing legal
Gotta celebrate the nups
All of you come
watch my number
Tell Albertine to hurry
with the dress
Say, is the kid home yet?
This tops it all off!
I oughtta fire you
Thanks for ditchin' me
Left me stuck with
that old bag
Some job! A fanny-wiggler
in a dive
Are you OK?
I'm engaged...
- You're pregnant?
- Not yet
But we're getting
married anyway
This calls for a drink. Allow
me to offer you a drop
- You sure talk good.
- It comes natural
- You've hardly touched it
- I'm driving
I nearly forgot: Gabriel says
hurry with the dress
He's asked us all for
drinks tonight
Stop! Stop!
Fire! Fire!
At their age!
I'm losing my head
Ain't we all?
You here?
- You 'n the cop are a real yak.
- A yak to you, to us it's real
Real, my ass
I simply must get dressed
What threads should I wear?
I can't picture you naked
It's just us girls
Alone?
Out for a stroll, my dear
It's no time to walk alone
I'm waiting for the gang.
We'll see Unkie dance
That elephant? In a tutu, yet
May I walk with you?
I'm so-o lonely
Be understanding
with adults
Ah, love! It's great!
Someday you'll know
No smut, lady, or I call
a cop. A DIFFERENT cop
Cruel child
Poor old bag. Still,
cops ain't my dish
Of course, if your
uncle had only...
Lay off my Unkie, he's married
and you ain't stacked
like my Aunt
Trouscaillon is enough for me
Because Love is...
- You're a broken record
- Then bye!
An engagement...
That calls for a virgin-white
blouse
Then, mine can be off-white
What about your green
and purple skirt?
You like me in it?
- You bet. You were dreamy.
- Then you know I'm alive?
I'm pretty big on you
Indeed?
You're the greatest
You really built.
And oh, so-o chic
You exaggerate
You're the most
Why don't we see you
more often?
Yes, why don't we?
You, the picture of
Beauty and Hygiene...
I'm not the show-off type
Wait! I hit even harder
Why'd you ask us over tonight?
You who hide behind the
veil of modesty,
who flees the admiring
throngs
The cabbie's engaged?
Who dat old goon?
- I hate parrots.
- See an analyst
I seek to analyze my dreams
What dreams?
Of wet-nurses
What's wrong Mr. Gabriel?
Stage-fright
You're on!
Stage-fright!
On accounta me?
- No, Mr. Pedro
- Why Mr. Pedro?
'Cuz that was your
name this morning
Forget it. I did
Wanna know what
I'm after?
Couldn't care less
Dis-gusting
I've got some questions
for you
I won't talk
But I am Inspector
Bertin-Poiret
My card
An obvious phoney
Ever see a gangster movie?
I'd have you busted. No warrant,
violation of domicile...
I could go for the
violation bit
I've got you under my skin
Minute I saw you, I wanted in
And baby, it's cold outside
I am rather impatient by nature
I got it BAD
You're a phoney cop
Do you think that real cops
can't fall in love?
You're a fool
Some cops can't get
to 1st base
My fatal charm...
My fatal charm will
slam a four-bagger
You must be kidding!
Just wait until my sex
appeal goes to work
And if it doesn't work?
Then I'll jump you
The A.M., it was Zazie
But a real looker like you...
- Where's the gang?
- They bore me
- I'll get your bag.
- I play the field
This A.M., the kid
At 12, you, baby-doll, you. In
the P.M., that society broad
The Baroness Me. 1 look at me,
and she's over me like
a cheap suit
5 minutes later, I'm a baron
Am I too hi-class for you?
You don't dig my fatal charm?
- Why get clothesed?
- You mean "clothed"
Ya can't show me
Look it up
So! An egghead, yet
Let's see: Cloam, Clonic...
All households words...
Clote... here it is: Clothe!
I clothe, I clothed, I am clothed
"Clothed!" I was right
Unclasp, unclothe: Opposite
of "Clothe"
"Unclothe"  Get it?  UNCLOTHE!
Take everything off, my darling
Gabriel's show is the best
- But no new material.
- That's show people
They always plug the same routine.
- Don't we all?
- Not me. I keep changing my act.
- Because your act stinks
It's always a big ol' flop
You're a Grade "A" ham
- Even in uniform?
- It don't help
It's the lecher!
- Where's the moustache?
- Left it home
Disturbing the peace...
Making a public nuisance...
Look again. I'm a copper
Onion Soup!
Gabriel, I hereby proclaim
and decree,
when it comes to dancing,
You're Top Banana!
Cheer up. Ugly as you are, you're
sure to hook a new man
Onion soup. Wine...
...That's the life!
Chow down, Zazie
Let her sleep. Let her dream
That hag's still aboard?
Be charitable. Right, old hag?
You're kind. Chilrden
are heartless
How long's she gonna yak on?
Can it! The old bag's had it
- The ladies hate our 'kraut?
- You guessed it
Foreigners griping about
French cuisine!
- Know what that costs?
- You tell me? I'm in the business
It goes down easy
See? You can't lose face
People are fools,
including you
Is it the prices?
They're fair...
...but the taxes!
Take your hands off me!
Revenge!
1 for Laverdure,
1 for Mado...
To hell with cops!
God is dead!
Yes, it is I, Prince
Haroun al Raschid,
whom you have known, yet
little appreciated
Trouscaillon! Dream boat!
Too stupid. I, who have
high-yield investments
Crooked arm of the law,
noctivigant rogue,
hunter of widows and orphans
I gaily don the mask of
confusion and error
Go to bed. I'll care
for the kid
The strike's over!
An idiot at that
If he insists, maybe
I won't say no, but,
I won't run after
him no more
Bye Albert
Bye, Sir
So, did you have fun?
- So-so.
- See the metro?
So what did you do?
I grew up some
