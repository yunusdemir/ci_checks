Millennium was the end
too much.
Natural resources dried up, the global
financial markets collapsed,
And the crisis has united
human destiny-
Left-isolated individuals
in its decay.
Trexx group said that the peace
movement and would save us-
And therefore linked together
all European metro-
-Into a huge system - the Metro.

"But it is said that you have covered.
-Maybe once. It's not...
Legally. It is not without reason;
if you ask me.
Who told you that?
Was it Monica? It was Monica, eh?
You know what I was doing

Skydiving.
Damn, how lovely it was.

Welcome to the world's largest

Trexx metro systems, infrastructural
Revolution, the biggest since the railways
A peace project which has blurred the
final borders between the peoples of Europe.
I've always seen Trexx
as a living organism.
A body, but made of steel, stone and
concrete, with one heart and one soul.
And the blood flowing in its veins
is Dangst.
Allow me to demonstrate. Dandruff Shampoo
has only one known side effect.
It gives dandruff.
You just thought:
"Did this man my hat
With wet fingers? "
How... how did you do that?
"I actually thought that.
-Taste.
Well? How it tasted?
Pungent. Almost rancid.
Quite simply: it is undrinkable.
-Take a sip of.
-No thanks.
Or...
Wait. I do not.
It was like a voice in my head.
Not my own voice - and it said:
"Drink. It is good."
Wait. How did you do that?
How did you...
I forgot to shut it down.
Not a problem, I'll just...
Sorry about that.
<i>-Is not it Nina Swartzcruit?
"I have a question.</i>
Can someone using shampoo
take control of another human being?
I do not understand.
For example,
advantage of a young girl sexually.
Convince her. Get her to believe
that she wants even though she does not want.
Do you understand what I mean now?
Dangst is a very powerful
communication tools.
l the wrong hands can use tools
as a tool to harm others.
I am prompted to ask you to go,
Miss Swartzcruit.
-Did you hear me?
"I do not move if you go out.
Are you blind? I walk.
The voices that you talked about...
What do you know more about them?
I thought you did not hear voices.
Think you can handle the truth?
<i>Hauptbahnhof, Berlin.</i>
This is a private area.
Miss Swartzcruit.
Wow. Dangst.
Damn!
<i>Roger.</i>
<i>Roger.</i>
<i>-Roger? Hello?
-Who are you?</i>
Who are you?
<i>Who the hell are you?</i>
I will contact the authorities.
Perhaps the media. People should be told.
Whatever they do, I know
that it is illegal.
<i>They are the authorities.
They control governments, media...</i>
I do not need the media, government agencies.
Nobody!
What are you doing?
Damn! Best we go!
<i>This is a security alarm, code red.
Security staff to sector B.</i>
There must be something we can do, huh?
We can not talk - not here.
They listen to your thoughts.
Come on. Come on!
I should be safe now. If it goes
to 3.4, anything can happen.
Sorry. What do you do if you lose
control over its subjects?
It depends. What is it?
Well... it may sound a bit strange-
-But it feels as if
someone else controlling him.
Okay... And you are sure you
not only to misjudge the situation?
-No, something is wrong.
-You must talk to Ralph Parker.
You know, I've been dreaming about you.
We were kids. You had
a large red and green parrot.
But it flew out a window and
disappeared in. .. a wood type.
We walked around among the trees
and tried to catch it-
-But all the time it was too high up,
so we could never catch it.
You know something?
We actually had a parrot.
It was red and orange
and light green on the belly.
But it never went away.
-Must be something we can do, huh?
-My plan puts an end to all this.
I can help you get rid of the voice
permanently. But you must help me.
"I'm just so...
-Scared?
No. It is not there.
I'm just so normal.
The guy who is dissatisfied with his life,
their job, their all-
And can not blame someone else
because it's his own damn choice.
If it is not your choice then?
I decided
to follow after you.
What had you done, Zelda?
It is easy for you to say.
No. No, I can not.
They kill him.
Do not trust government officials.
But they turned on everything and...
It is just an illusion...
<i>Listen.
You do not know the truth about her.</i>
<i>-She is a parasite.
-What does he say? The voice.</i>
<i>-A parasite, Roger.
"I do not know... Many things.</i>
<i>-It is best we hurry.
-Roger. Where are you?</i>
<i>Will they come?</i>
Listen carefully now, Roger Olofson.
<i>My name is Stefan. I'm yours
inner voice. Your life is in danger.</i>
She is not the
She claims to be.
<i>For your sake
I am ready to meet you.</i>
<i>But we can not be seen on lnvoice.
And Nina could not be with.</i>
-What does he say?
-Whatever you do, please do not tell her.
"He wants to meet me.
-Say no.
-Why?
-You can not. Okay?
-Okay, but...
-You must trust me.
<i>-You can not see him.
-Why not?</i>
Wait here.
Follow her.
I thought you fixed it. Now would
he hit him. What do I say?
You'll see. What did I tell you?
Okay, where we meet?
Roger!
Mr Parker-looking you.
-Good evening.
Well?
We have Bassas signature.
-My God, what have I done...
Sign-in.
The problem with Amelia has also been resolved.
But we might not
reach an agreement.
I assume that you know
incident in lngolstadt.
Strengthening the review at the entrances
implemented at present.
It can lead to some delay
in the program, but... 35 min.
I did not ask how you will
clean up after your faux pas.
I want to know how the
at all could happen.
What would she have? More money?
We can not buy us out of it now.
-She is a killer, greedy...
-Do not forget who you're talking to.
"I was just trying to...
-Tries... just do the weak.
-Are you weak?
-No, sir.
It is not personal.
I care about functionality.
What is your role?
Your safety, sir.
-The damage is done.
-There will be no more incidents.
We continue as planned. They are
to Scandinavia, at C14. 22:30.
And where is the nudity?
-Yes, there will be nudity.
-Did somebody after you?
-No, I do not think so.
Hell, Satan... What the hell do I do?
-Who are you?
-You must go home - now.
-Who the hell are you?
"I am not.
"I just work there.
-All this shit is totally sick!
"They will kill you.
-What, then, kill me? Tell us.
You make me completely confused!
What "they"? Ivan Bahn?
Do not ask.
Please, forget all about it here.
Why me? What have I done?
I'm a regular fucking Smith!
Explain just what I have done.
Say... What have I done?!
When I got your eye on my table
and saw your picture the first time-
-I could not resist
to see how similar we are.
Go home. So maybe we can cope.
Why do you say no to them?
Why do you care about me?
The longer you are working inside someone,
more difficult it becomes to distinguish-
-On "me" and... "You".
-Nina, then?
-What does she want you to do?
"She helps me get rid of the voice.
-Type, permanently?
-Are you going to kill me?
-No.
Is it not strange that
She has not said who she is?
-Has she never said...
-She is on the damn shampoo bottle.
She is the daughter of Ivan Bahn.
-Impossible.
-Why not ask her yourself?
Satan.
Roger! Wait.
Roger... You just disappeared.
I have looked everywhere.
I must go home now.
It has happened and something...
"I must go home.
-So you thought, just dump me?
I just have to go home now.
I've been thinking a lot
and do not want anybody to get hurt.
I understand, really. I know
that you have someone waiting at home.
But I must tell you something.
Come with me.
It does not take long. Please.
I need you.
Perhaps more than you need me.
Damn. I'm sorry.
I can not, I can not do it.
<i>The number you have suggested
can unfortunately not be linked.</i>
Why the hell do you answer no
when you know that I should call?
Really?
And you want me to believe in it?
Well, I mixed up the numbers?
He is here.
He actually seems to be okay.
Do you think I'm sexy?
You can touch me.
Damn. Did the bulbs?
Or was it a fuse?
-Damn. What should we do?
-Wait. Roger, come back.
What the hell is happening here? We may
will stick. Or what do you think?
"I do not like this.
-Who cares?
"I do not like darkness.
-What?
I really think we should go.
Listen...
There is actually something else
I wanted to ask you.
Unbelievable.
I thought
that you had a girl at home.
Yes, I have.
But it is not there.
I was told
that you are Ivan Bahn's daughter.
-Have you ever been in New York?
-By boat, you mean? Do you?
Only in New York I can
come out and know just from the smell:
"Yes, here I am."
-Or in Paris, now, for example.
-Sure...
You can believe whatever you want;
but I have not planned this.
Although we would die
we have experienced this situation. Huh?
Yes, but...
I actually planned not to die.
Where the hell are you?! They rang from
job. You did not come this morning.
I would just call the emergency room
to see if anything happened to you.
... I called Karl. He offered
to keep me company until you came.
<i>Hello? Are you there?</i>
Is he still there?
You know what? It does not matter.
Hello...?
What do we do now?
Do you have... I do not know... a plan?
You know what
a flux compression generator is?
It generates an electromagnetic pulse
-To eliminate all electronic
equipment within 500 meters radius.
Kind of like a lightning bolt that strikes
in lnvoice headquarters.
Nobody gets hurt.
And I will be deleted from the system.
-Will not that be something system.
-Okay, where do we find one of those?
-I already have one.
Look!
I did not know it was so big.
There is a lot higher than I thought.
Eiffel Tower! Unbelievable! Eiffel Tower!
-Hi.
-Hi.
-Has something happened?
-Where is your personality?
I think he is at home.
Probably.
-Really?
-Is something wrong?
-Where have you been?
-Everyone had coffee.
-No, before.
Take-out, took a smoking break, perhaps?
I have not been able to stop.
It's hard.
Your colleague said you seemed to have
problems with your personality today.
Yes, I thought I had it.
But I had not.
It is good. It is...
I know that you do not
is completely honest, Stefan.
It's best you follow up with me.
-Okay.
Do not worry about me, Zelda.
I get along.
Where are we?
I thought we were going up.
-Can we smoke here?
-Yes, you and I can smoke here.
-Did you buy that bell?
-What?
<i>You mentioned a Patek Philippe with 24
complications at the Christmas party last year.</i>
I am wasting my time on you?
He came here.
So I decided that maybe I should
meet him and I did it.
Just to say that he should
take the first train back to Stockholm.
Which I suppose he did.
It was a great idea.
Very wise.
Sometimes we take things
and things into their own hands.
-Think outside the box, huh?
-Yes. That is my motto.
It is best for the organization...
I am always loyal
and thinking outside the box.
I know that you do.
ONLY
He has traveled with her....
Well... Nina.
-What happened?
-What do you mean?
They went into the Metro and...
I wonder where they should.
-Who is he?
-Ralph Parker.
He is head of security at Trexx
and lnvoice. What is it?
I have not been
completely honest with you.
I met him. The other one.
I appreciate your honesty.
He exposes us, if he speaks?
Now, we are sure
he is not included.
-You and Stephen are very similar.
-Yes, I know, but...
If I give you his ID card
you can get into.
Listen carefully. Take the elevator to floor 1 6;
the Scandinavian Department.
At Stephen's desk, in your backpack,
You will find a Hello Kitty doll.
As soon as you put it on the table
press the navel.
Then go to one of the toilets.
Go out, look around.
If it worked-
-The entire system is deleted
and it is chaos there.
<i>He sees what I see.
He hears my thoughts.</i>
Ladies and gentlemen...
Dangst meets all environmental requirements.
The bottles are completely recyclable.
And here we have the
which we call a think-tank.
As you can imagine are now many
entities outside the broadcast radius.
But right now are the most
Europe's hottest reality show "Asylum".
What is the status?
Can we get a picture of my wife?
When she sees on TV, do you mean?
Yes, I got it.
Maybe she can undress now.
We were able to follow
our residents in their home
-With cameras in TVs
since the late 1990's.
We do everything we can to
not violate anyone's privacy.
It was recently that we,
through this amazing shampoo-
-Has been able to reach them in
Underground tanks with custom.
That fucking bastard!
He has been muted.
<i>-Was it my phone?
-No, it was the TV</i>
<i>He said he would come home.</i>
<i>As your friend
makes me really sad to see-</i>
<i>-How bad it is between you two.</i>
<i>But after seven years, I can not
just, like, put an end to it.</i>
<i>He's like a part of me.
As...</i>
<i>... A natural part of me.</i>
<i>"I know how excited you are.
"I thought it was just like you said.</i>
<i>Huh? Did you
I was trying to seduce you?</i>
Fucking pigs!
<i>Would it be so awful
if I tried to seduce you?</i>
<i>-What? L You're kidding, right?
-Are you watching this?</i>
Damn... Anna!
It is very fascinating.
I'll show one of my favorites.
Over here we have a partner whose
every night when he is asleep...
... For about five minutes...
satisfy himself.
It was weird.
Why are both of the screens?
Mr. Bahn, I do not understand.
How will the image from your eyes?
Sorry, I can not go into
technical details, but...
Mind if I borrow this?
This is a normal hair.
Do you see?
But for us
it may also be an antenna.
Dangst contains
organic micro-chips
, Which embeds itself so deeply
in our resident scalp-
-It gives us full access
for their vision and hearing.
And - hang on now...
every word that person thinks.
-Jeez, it's just amazing.
Mr-Bahn, we are waiting for masturbation now?
<i>-Anna?
-Watch now. What happened?</i>
<i>-Where did the woman go?
