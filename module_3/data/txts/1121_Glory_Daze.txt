The first... and the best
confrontment. Refront.
Can you lay down The English Beat
and then appeal to the General Public?
General Public?
That's right.
<i>Coming to Hayes</i>
For a one-time-only club show --
Just 200 seats --
General Public.
<i>I've got to see
that show.</i>
Ditto, roomie.
I swear, it's like we share
the same brain.
And yet you continue
to question the validity
Of our compatibility form?
I question a lot of things
about you, Zack.
That form is just one
of them.
<i>Tickets go on sale tomorrow
at 6:00 A.M.</i>
<i>But right now,</i>
WHBD 109 FM is ready
to give away
A pair of front-row tickets
<i>To the 109th caller.</i>
Don't worry -- if I win,
There's no one in the world
I would rather attend with.
I'll just use
the pay phone.
You are caller number 1-0--
Oh, my God! I won!
I'm a winner!
<i>Take a quaalude, eager beaver.</i>
<i>You're only caller 108.</i>
Hello, lucky 109!
Talk to me.
<i>Uh, what?</i>
<i>Stankowski?
Hello?</i>
<i>Hello, caller.
Congratulations.</i>
Yeah, hi.
Who -- what is going on?
I'm...Yeah. Uh, hello.
<i>Oh, my God. Yeah, I'm
really confused right now.</i>
I'm just trying to order, like,
my gut buster.
Can you help me out?
"gut buster"?
Yeah, gut buster.
You know --
like, the big thing?
Can I get the big thing?
Can I get extra everything
on there?
I want everything on there.
I love it.
And can I get, um --
who is this?
Is this a new guy?
Can I talk to Phil?
Phil's my guy for this.
<i>All righty.</i>
<i>Looks like caller 110
is our lucky winner today.</i>
Hello, caller.
Hello.
Is this Phil?
Can I talk to Phil?
Stankowski? Again?
I'm so hungry.

Season 1, Episode 6- "I Ram So Far Away"
Oh! God!
Come on!
What is this?
And why is it bookmarking
a lingerie catalog?
Maybe 'cause I wasn't done
reading it.
A letter that was addressed
to me, Turbo,
That I never had a chance
to read?
Did any of you read this?
It says that an adviser
from national
Will be here to visit us
and put us under formal review
In...Less than 24 hours.
24 hours isn't much notice.
Oh, it was postmarked
two weeks ago.
I say we refuse his visit!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Do you think
before you speak?
That's good to know.
Never!
Your little
sheepherding business
Is confined to the basement
until the adviser leaves.
Guys, this is our chance
To finally prove to national
that we've cleaned up our act.
Maybe we can get off probation
once and for all.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
And if we don't,
they can yank our charter.
Nobody's yanking
anything.
Mnh-mnh.
Okay, gentlemen.
It appears that we need to
transform ourselves
And this domicile into something
worthy of inspection.
All right?
It's not just about
cleaning.
We have beer coming out
of our faucets
And a keg where the water heater
should be.
Do we have any idea how much
this guy even knows about us?
Oh, if he knows half of what you
and I know, we are so screwed.
Hey, guys.
I just ordered a pizza
If any of you guys are, like,
hungry and stuff, you know?
Whoa.
Uh, the one thing
that they do know about --
Stankowski.
Wait.
I don't -- I don't get it.
<i>So, like, General Public
was The English Beat?</i>
Okay.
Here's the deal.
The English Beat --
my favorite band, by the way --
Split up into two groups.
One half formed General Public,
who rule,
And the other half started
Fine Young Cannibals,
Who do not.
Look, all I know is we are going
to that concert, okay?
You know how much play
those tickets are gonna get us
With the ladies? How
are we gonna get tickets
When we're here cleaning
up all day? I know, man.
General Public is not coming
through this podunk town twice.
I hear that.
Which is exactly why you three
are gonna cover Harrington
While he gets us some tickets.
You good with that, Joel?
Yeah, I'm good with that.
Are you guys good
with that?
Yeah, definitely. Is that good? Yeah.
All right. Yeah?
Get me close, okay?
Make sure I'm in the aisle.
I need leg room in case the
spirit get to moving, all right?
Got it.
Amen.
All right. Thanks, Turbo. All right.
All right. We're gonna do it. Nice.
Get to work!
Let's go!
Pronto!
All right.
I'll see you guys.
No.
Don't beat around
the bush.
I know.
I understand.
Hey, dudes.
What brings you guys
to the lair?
Uh, a few things,
actually.
Come.
Seek comfort.
Um...
Look, I'm just gonna say it,
Stankowski.
With the national adviser
coming,
We need to get you clear.
I knew that this would
eventually come to an end.
Um, I'll get my hookah kit.
Will you guys at least help me
pack my bags?
Oh, no, no, no, no.
We're not --
we're not telling you to leave.
Oh, good.
The national adviser
Specifically requested
meeting...
"the 32-year-old man
Who has been living
on the premises since 1976."
<i>So,
you see, you can't leave.</i>
We need you here.
Just a different version
of you.
That means bathed.
Yeah.
You know, I'm down -- that's --
I'm good with that.
And weed-free.
Free weed. Yeah, I'm doubly good
with that. I love it.
No. That means
you can't smoke pot.
What's the longest you've
ever gone without getting high?
14 years.
Wow.
That's a long time.
Well, when was that exactly?
Uh, between the ages of, um,
birth and 14.
Okay, Stankowski,
that's not helping us.
Oh, you know, there was another
time in my life
Where I was, uh, not high
For like 34 hour-- hours,
If my memory does serve me
correctly,
Which it usually does not.
Do you think you got
another 34 in you?
Hey, guys.
What brings you to the lair?
Yeah, we're in trouble.
Hey, chang!
Hey.
Hey.
What's up, man?
Wow. You got a great spot.
Yeah. What time did you get here?
About 7:00 A.M.
I like to be out of the room
when Eli has his morning time.
I really don't want to know
what that means.
Actually scares me a little. Me too.
Wow.
This line's really long.
They say this is the best thing
to happen to Hayes
Since Joe Piscopo's one-man show
last year.
Wow.
Better get in line, then.
All right. See you, man.
See you later.
Hey. Christie.
There you are!
Where have you been?
I've been waiting.
What?
You do know that it's --
it's Joel, right?
I'm trying to help you
cut in line.
You do want tickets,
right?
Really?
Yeah.
You serious?
Yes.
All right.
I really wish
you'd stop volunteering us
For the worst jobs
in the house.
Hey, man. Cleaning Stankowski's
room is an honor, okay?
We've been entrusted
with sacred ground.
Hey, bros.
Check it out.
There are some things
that a man can't...Un-see.
You were supposed to
shave him.
Hey, the beard stays, bro.
Okay?
So, how do I look --
Ready for, like,
polite society or whatever?
Honestly, you don't look
any different.
Hey, at least he doesn't smell
like bong water anymore.
Ah, the nectar of the gods.
Come here.
Ow. It's tangled.
Ow.
Oh, be gentle, beentle.
Ow! It's tangled! Aah!
Okay, okay. All right, all
right. Ow! It's tangled!
All right, all right, all right.
Stankowski, sit down.
All right,
get comfortable.
All right, so, Stankowski,
we made you a list
Of all the words you can't say
when you're with the adviser.
All right?
"uh," "chill,"
"like," "bro,"
"dude," "okay," "totally,"
and "like."
Yo, do you, like, guys
realize
That the word "like"
is, like, in there twice?
<i>You realize</i>
That you just said the same word
three times in one sentence?
Whoa!
Positive reinforcement, dude!
I like that.
<i>I-I mean,
I enjoy that.</i>
All right!
Oh! Okay!
Nice work, Stankowski.
That's very impressive.
Thank you.
How long has it been?
Uh, he's been weed-free
for about...
14 minutes.
We're making progress.
14 minutes!
Oh, 14-- 14 minutes!
Ho...
Let me just smoke
one more --
No, no! No, no! Hey! Hey!
Okay, okay! Wean me off it,
is what I'm saying.
Come on, come on!
O-okay!
It's kinky.
What are you doing?
So, I guess Damon couldn't
wait in line with you
because of the whole
national-adviser thing?
Actually, Damon's not really
a concert guy.
Oh. That's --
I'm sorry.
No, it's okay. I mean, you won't find
me checking football stats on sundays.
Those actually come in
on Monday.
Exactly my point.
Having different interests
than your boyfriend
<i>Is not a bad thing.</i>
Yeah, not at all.
I mean, I had a girlfriend
like that...
Until she broke up
with me
Because we had
nothing in common.
No, I mean, I --
<i>Not that
it's gonna happen to you.</i>
I'm sure you guys are totally
in it for -- for the long haul.
But...
Besides,
that girl had issues.
Yeah, she used to write
four letters every day
To ricky schroder.
Really?
Yeah, it was weird.
<i>Hmm. Thought I was the only one
who did that.</i>
Actually, for me, it was
more like six...Or seven.
yeah,
you got to love that ricky.
It's looking better.
When push came to shove, I knew
our boys could band together.
Yeah, but we have
a long way to go --
Like the beer
coming out of our plumbing.
Oh, relax, man. We got all night
to roto that rooter.
I thought
I drank all that.
Good evening, gentlemen.
I'm your national adviser,
brother Jerrod.
Brother Jerrod.
Uh, what a wonderful
surprise.
I'm Damon Smythe,
house president.
And this is...
Uh, uh, Michael Reno,
our house social chair.
did I mention what
a wonderful surprise this is?
Well, I just wrapped up
my stay at purdue --
Adjusted their membership
by four or five members --
And figured, "if I can
get to Hayes by midnight,
<i>"why not go and scare the crap
out of those guys" -- right?</i>
Whoo!
So here I am.
Oh, boy.
The adviser's here early!
How's Stankowski?
How's it looking in there?
Well, um,
as the spanish would say,
"no bueno."
Oh, this is not good.
Which is why
he said "no bueno."
Oh, man.
He's become resistant.
We're talking denial,
some depression, a few tears.
"I do not like
green eggs and ham."
Ohh...
Dudes, this is confusing,
and that's my favorite meal!
I can't do this!
Look, we're also getting
a fair amount of anger.
Oh, man.
All the stages of grief.
How much more time
y'all gonna need?!
Well, uh, on a scale
Between "1" and "as long
as Damon and Reno can stall,"
I'm gonna go with
"no bueno" again.
I've seen a lot of schools,
gentlemen,
Met a lot of young men,
and believe me,
I make it
a rule of thumb --
Never judge a book
by its cover.
Words to live by,
sir.
That said, I recently saw
a book -- "the great gatsby."
Perhaps
you've heard of it.
Anyway,
it had this amazing cover.
And I read it.
It was great.
<i>So maybe you can judge.</i>
Are you boys familiar with the
phrase "political correctness"?
I'm not surprised.
But it's out there,
spreading roots.
And pretty soon,
that phrase will be as familiar
As the phrase "nuthugger."
<i>Are you ready
to live in that world?</i>
Frankly, a world
where "nuthugger" is a phrase
Gives me the willies,
sir.
<i>It gives me pause, too,
brother Reno,</i>
But believe me,
we are in a world right now
Where soon, a mexican
will be called a latino
And a latino
will be called a chicano
And a retard
will be called special.
It is my job to make sure
That the Omega Sigs are prepared
to live in that world.
And we appreciate
that preparation, sir.
Times are changing, boys,
And this house
is ripe for a lawsuit.
Speaking of
legal infractions,
I'm very interested
In this 32-year-old male
of undetermined status
Living in this house.
Oh, no. His status is --
is very determined.
He is a student of many
subjects, disciplines, degrees.
He sounds fascinating.
When do I get to meet
this William Xavier Stankowski?
Uh, we can't wait
for you to meet William.
As soon as he returns from...
Singing to the elderly.
he never stops giving.
You think
he'd get tired.
Okay, okay.
You got me on that one.
How about this?
Sean Connery or Roger Moore?
Oh, come on.
Connery by a mile.
Me too.
Come on.
Give me a tough one.
Okay. Um...
Ferris Wheel...
Or Ferris Bueller?
what?
That doesn't even make sense.
Oh, I think it does, Joel.
Clock's ticking.
Pick a Ferris --
Wheel or Bueller.
"Bueller? Anyone?"
Would it disappoint you if I said
that I didn't have a preference?
Disappoint me?
No.
I mean,
the game's called "either/or."
But I'm sure
"I don't have a preference"
Is gonna sweep the nation
any day now.
What can I say?
I'm a trendsetter.
Good.
And here's our kitchen.
Uh-huh.
Well...
I like your glassware.
It's nice
when someone notices.
Brother Jerrod, is there
something I can help you with?
Just gonna get a glass
of water.
No, no, no! We won't have you
drinking water from the tap.
No. An important man like you
deserves bottled water.
I've heard of that.
Do not fear, Oscar.
I refused his visit.
Everything's gonna be okay.
You know, you never told me
How the rest of dad's day
panned out.
Uh, it was...It was good.
Is that a question?
no, no.
It was definitely good.
Yeah.
I wasn't sure
it would ever happen,
But my dad's actually cool with
me being in a fraternity now.
Isn't it great when parents do
things like that --
You know, remind you
that they're real people?
Yeah, it is great.
Although sometimes it can be
kind of weird.
I remember this one time
I walked in on my parents
in the bath.
My dad's 6'8".
My mom's 5'1".
It's a small tub.
I mean, they were just all over
each other.
There was big limbs and
little limbs just flying and...
I'm sorry.
I...I thought we were sharing.
No. You were sharing.
I was cringing.
I'm sorry.
You know,
I-I look at my parents sometimes
And wonder how they ever
ended up together.
But we were
at this wedding once,
And after a series
of disco moves
That I truly believe
scarred me life,
I watched them
dance this slow dance.
And...I know this is gonna
sound stupid,
But suddenly...
I understood, you know?
I guess the little moments
Are how you know
people are right for each other.
Well, things seem to be
in order...
Except for the lack
of toilet paper
In the downstairs bathroom.
Let's take a look
upstairs.
What are y'all
doing here?!
You're supposed to be
in there with him!
We were until he started
yelling at us.
Withdrawals, man.
It was ugly.
The adviser is coming up.
Just make sure he doesn't go
in that room, okay?
Ah, an impromptu
gathering.
Something of interest
here?
Pledge Eli Feldman,
your honor.
Oh, you don't
need to kneel.
Although I like it.
Pledge Jason Wilson, sir,
of the Pennsylvania Wilsons.
Ah, those are my favorite
Wilsons of all.
Pledge, uh,
Brian Sommers.
Uh...Capricorn.
I see capricorns
don't kneel.
Just kidding.
Not really.
Well, it's been a long day.
I think I'll turn in.
Fantastic, brother.
We're gonna have you
right over here in my room.
Just after I see
what's behind that door.
Uh...
Why this door?
Fellas, I've spent a lot of time
in fraternity houses,
And I recognize a roadblock
when I see one.
Oh, this isn't
a roadblock.
This -- this...
It's just three pledges
kneeling in a row.
Smythe, open the door.
Now?
Now.
Brother Jerrod, I presume.
Are you in the mood for Mozart?
Come on in.
Believe it or not,
That was how I beat
George Plimpton in croquet.
oh, that's marvelous.
It was an honor to meet you,
William.
You too, sir.
Brother Jerrod,
I've made up my bed for you.
Thank you.
You did it.
I'm so proud of you.
Oh!
Go. Go.
Go inside.
I think I aged 10 years
last night.
Stankowski's due
for an Oscar.
I don't know what those pledges
did to him.
And yet part of me misses
the smell of bong water.
<i>It is his essence.</i>
Rise and shine,
brother Jerrod.
You've got a meeting with
professor Haines in an hour.
Oh, naked.
Oh, honey.
Sorry.
We're gonna have to do
this yoga later.
Kiss little Jerrod Junior
for me.
Tell him daddy will be home
for four days this spring.
Oh, my apologies, boys.
Just trying to do some yoga
with my wife.
Boy, when you're on the road
as much as I am,
You got to find ways
to keep the romance alive.
Don't picture her naked.
I'm trying not to picture
anyone naked. All right.
Now, if one of you brothers
would kindly open those blinds,
I'd like to center myself
with a sun salutation.
Mm-hmm.
I'm gonna just...
Whoa.
It's foggy.
Looks like the sun's
a little shy this morning.
What do you say
we skip the salute
And let brother Jerrod eat
in privacy, shall we?
I'll take that.
Nice.
The Beast.
I know.
I couldn't stop looking
at it.
It was huge.
And not just the length.
The girth.
<i>No, no. Not that Beast.
The Beast.</i>
Our Beast -- the 9-foot-tall
beer bong in the back.
Nobody moved it.
Oh, my God.
How does that
slip through the cracks?
Anyone up for a concert?
Oh!
Huh?!
Yeah!
Top of the morning, Joel.
Stankowski?
My name is William.
My father has great expectations
for me.
If you'll excuse me.
Okay.
Guys, what was that?
I hate myself
for what we did to him.
Guys,
what's going on here?
The Beast!
You knuckleheads never moved it!
Oh, gosh.
Oh, geez.
The adviser came early.
Oh, no.
Checkmate.
All right. Come on.
Hurry up.
We got to get this out of here
Before brother Jerrod comes from
his meeting with Haines, right?
My little legs can't handle
this, guys. We got it.
Doing good. You're doing good.
That's it, baby.
All right.
You got it.
Oh! Oh! Oh! Easy, easy.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stop, stop, stop!
Okay.
Let's regroup.
Let's regroup this. We
got to push it. Let's go.
Yeah.
Bring it back.
All right?
On three, guys, all right?
One! Two! One! Two! One! Two! One! Two!
Three! Three! Three! Three!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Oh, no! No!
Run! Run! Run! Run! Run!
No! No!
No!
Ohh!
Ohh!
Oh, please tell me
that's not brother Jerrod's car.
Faculty adviser Haines.
I'm brother Jerrod
from Omega Sigma.
Oh.
Call me Aloysius.
Very well.
Faculty adviser
Aloysius Haines.
<i>Dr. Aloysius Haines.</i>
Hmm.
You are the sixth
faculty adviser
That these Omega Sigmas have had
over the last two years.
For clerical purposes,
Would you mind if I referred
to you as number six?
I would.
You do realize that my visit
here could determine the future
Of the Omega Sigma chapter
at Hayes university?
This file contains
a mountain of evidence
Which hinges solely on my
interpretation of the facts.
Well, facts may be what
they are, but let's not forget.
This is a group of guys
with the best of intentions.
I take great pride in what I do,
number six.
And your liberal policies
with these boys --
Being their "friend" --
Makes it nearly impossible
for me to do my job.
<i>Well, these kids are
my friends.</i>
We've worked very hard
on establish--
What are you writing?
Just noting
your belligerence.
<i>My belligerence?!</i>
Exactly what have you done
to exert a positive influence
On the lives
of these young men?
Many things!
Is that so?
Would the top
of that list include
Hiding tinfoil-wrapped
dog poop
In the car
of a prominent attorney?
Wait.
How did you hear about this?
Have you been talking
to the Dean?
Has my wife's attorney talked
to the Dean?
I don't know.
Okay, look.
It doesn't matter anyways.
My personal life
should have no influence
On your view
of the Omega Sigs.
Besides, they're the ones that
taught me how to make a shant.
Please don't write that.
Please.
Oh, don't touch me.
"shant."
General Public. Thanks a lot.
I can't believe we had to
gi up those concert tickets.
What else
was I supposed to do?
We didn't have money
for the repairs.
It was the only way to get
brother Jerrod's car fixed.
We did the right thing.
Absolutely.
Mm-hmm.
Wait!
We want our tickets back!
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!
Hang in there,
William Stankowski.
Thanks to you, we're passing
brother Jerrod's visit
With flying colors.
Oh, I miss flying colors,
man.
I don't think I can do this
for much longer.
Don't worry.
You're doing great.
No.
Um, no, I'm not, okay?
It's been 28 hours.
My skin is itchy.
My tongue is dry.
And my head is banging,
you know?
It's like "mm...Mm...Mm."
You hear that?
You hear it, right?
Yeah.
Brothers!
You have so impressed me.
Not since last November
at wichita state
Have I been so inspired
by a group of Omega Sigmas.
And I'm here to offer you
a very special treat.
Oh, delightful.
William,
are you all right?
As I'm sure you've noticed,
William's very sensitive.
He, uh, he twitches with pride
At the mere mention
of this house receiving treats.
Well, my love for Omega Sigma
also runs very deep.
And I would like to express
our common passion
By joining you in your regular
harvest moon ritual.
And now the treat.
Behold, my brothers.
The sacred book of Omega Sigma.
The only one in existence,
Passed down generation
to generation,
Transcribed in the blood
of our founding fathers
And our founding fathers'
fathers' blood.
That's a lot of blood.
Lot of blood.
While I prepare,
gather the others.
What was that?
We're screwed.
Why? It's the one thing we can
do right -- harvest moon.
Uh, here's the thing.
We don't actually know
the harvest moon ritual.
What are you
talking about?
You have us do it
every month,
Even when there's no harvest --
or moon.
Look,
I made up my own version.
I-it just seemed
more harvest-moony to me.
You think brother Jerrod
will know the difference?
He noticed the wreath
on our crest had 26 leaves
Instead of 27.
You tell me.
You guys hear it now, right?
It goes
"mm...Mm...Mm...Mm."
Okay. Yeah, we hear it.
We hear it.
Brothers, tonight
we honor the harvest moon
beneath whose healing
glow we reveal our true selves.
Brother Damon,
may I continue leading?
Oh, by all means.
Please.
As passed down to us from
our founding fathers' fathers,
Whose sacred text I now hold,
we recite --
Oh, to a time
when the grass grows high.
Oh, to a time
when the grass grows high.
When a seed becomes a bud.
When a seed becomes a bud.
Oh, gosh.
And in this bountiful season,
We inhale the hearty scent
of the earth.
That's it, man.
Later.
I'm out.
William?
Oh, no, no, no, no.
He's -- he's okay.
He's -- he's easily overwhelmed
by the power of ritual.
As am I.
Must find stash.
By the bounty of the earth
and the richness of the soil...
Brother Damon,
you may continue.
Oh.
Oh, brother Jerrod.
But when you speak
of the richness of the soil,
It's -- it's as if I'm
hearing it for the first time.
Oh, thank you.
But I insist.
All right.
Uh...
Here we go.
The...Rich soil,
with its richness,
Was very enriching.
Very enriching.
Come on.
Come on.
Where are you, dude?
Bring forth the scythes.
What is going on?
There are no scythes
in the harvest moon ritual.
Really?
No.
Remove the scythes!
What is wrong with you two?
Go!
I promise to never leave you
again.
Bring forth the...Sabers.
No sabers?
I missed you, dude.
You know?

<i>Tranquilo.</i>
Oscar, what's wrong?
This is your favorite song.
How do you feel
about the golden ax?
Give me this!
What is going on in this room?!
Whoa, whoa. Okay, okay, okay.
I'll give you
"embarrassing,"
But "abomination" --
it's a bit harsh.
It's not harsh enough!
What the...
Is that a...
No, no, no, no, no!
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
Oh!
No!
oh, no.
Oscar!
The blood
of our founding fathers
And their founding fathers'
fathers!
<i>Okanow it's an abomination.</i>
The burning blood!
Guys, I am really sorry.
It's all right.
It's all right, man.
No. We were in the clear
if I didn't --
Gentlemen, I cannot believe what
I have witnessed here tonight.
Livestock in the basement?!
See why I refused his visit?
Not now, Hector.
Who is this?
Oh, he's just a guest
of the house, sir.
Please continue.
Uh, where was I?
Uh, livestock!
Oh, yes -- a faculty adviser
of questionable morality
And very unsound judgment,
Beer in the plumbing --
Which I did notice,
by the way --
And I was gonna let it go
until I saw the destruction
Of our most holy
of sacred books.
Not to mention
the bastardization
Of the holy harvest moon ritual!
Brother Jerrod,
please let me explain.
<i>No, I will not let you do
anything.</i>
In fact, I don't want to hear
another word
From the person
who is leading this house
And deviating wildly
from our rituals and traditions!
No wonder these gentlemen
are lost and aimless!
You have destroyed
the very foundation
Of what makes us who we are!
You, sir, are a disgrace
to the order of Omega Sigma.
Damon.
Hey, Damon.
Uh-oh.
Oh. Okay.
Um...
You can't even see me
right now.
I'm invisible.
Poof.
Whoa.
He looks so pissed.
I guess I'm not invisible.
Can you guys see me right now?
It's working.
Well, what would you have me do, kitten?
I mean, do you have any idea
How much paperwork is involved
in dismantling a fraternity?
Trust me.
There is no place
I would rather be
Than home with you
and little Jerrod...Junior.
Oh, shut up.
What?
Huh?
You don't know me.
You don't know me,
Mr. Arthur Wesley Hayes.
You don't know me.
Huh, man?
Yeah.
Damon.
What?
Damon.
What?
Oh.
Whoa. Man...
What are you doing?
We've been looking all over
for you, man.
W-we need you back at the house. Why?
So I can be mocked?
Turned on?
Ridiculed like some idiot?
No. Damon.
You should see those guys
back there, man.
They're lost.
Look, they need
their president.
Ha!
Do you know what I'm
the president of?
Crap.
I'm the president of crap.
I'm crap.
Damon, look at me.
You are not crap.
Have you ever seen
my girlfriend, Joel?
Oh, I got a beautiful
girlfriend.
Yes.
You're a very lucky man.
How can Christie be
with a man of crap like me?
Well, you know, I'm not sure
that I can answer that, Damon,
But you two seem to
make it work, right?
Oh, who cares?
It's all lies, Joel --
the whole thing.
A fraternity sucks you in
With all this talk
about brotherhood and loyalty.
and at first it feels so good.
Punch me in the face.
What? No.
I want you to punch me
in the face right now.
Damon, why would you want me
to do that?
Because I deserve it.
Damon, I am not gonna punch you
in the face.
Why does it always have to be
so hard for me?!
You don't understand
the pressure
Of keeping that house
under control.
Oh, you have no idea.
Okay, Damon, you might find this
hard to believe...
But I know what pressure is.
yeah.
My dad has been calling me
Dr. Harrington
Ever since I can remember.
He's been working double shifts
for the last 12 years
Just so I can go to Hayes
and then on to medical school.
And then I joined
this fraternity.
Pretty much threw my whole life
out of whack.
But you know what?
I'm glad that I did it.
Because I know that if I
ever found myself drunk,
Yelling at some statue...
...That one of my brothers
would come find me,
<i>Refuse to punch my face...</i>
...And take my ass
back home.
So what do you say?
Huh?
Huh?
You ready to go back?
Yeah?
All right, man.
At least one good thing
came out of all this.
I got Stankowski off weed.
Wow.
Brother Smythe.
Brother Jerrod.
You've returned.
Just in time to witness me
submit my final report
To national.
The letters will be removed
from outside this building
Within the week.
Brother Jerrod, wait.
Wait.
Before you go,
I want to say one thing.
Oh, I'm very drunk.
Actually, wait. No.
That wasn't it.
I love this fraternity.
In fact,
I probably love it too much.
And...Yes,
I made up some rituals.
But more importantly, I...
I let all these guys down.
Everything that happened
in this house
Happened
under my leadership.
A fish rots from the head,
brother Jerrod.
And I'm the stinking head
of this Omega Sig fish.
Punish me...Not them.
Young men cannot thrive
with faulty leadership.
Exactly.
That's why...
Brother Jerrod, I...
...I submit to you
my resignation
In exchange for saving
this house and its charter.
Okay.
Brother Damon,
you are hereby relieved
As president
of Omega Sigma.
You are deactivated
as a member,
You are banished
from these premises,
And your name shall be
officially stricken
From the Omega Sig
records.
As it should be.
The rest of you,
consider yourself warned.
You can expect
an unexpected visit from me
Some time in your
very near future.
Hey, wait a minute.
If you're gonna kick him out,
you got to kick me out, too.
Damon goes, I go.
Okay.
You're out.
Better kick me out, too.
Oh, good.
Nothing would make me happier.
If they go, Hector goes.
Who's Hector?
<i>I'm Hector.
Oh, yeah. Vamonos.</i>
Anyone else?
I am Spartacus, dude.
I'm also really dizzy.
Can you help -- help me up --
down?
The pledges go, too.
As well as all
the actives.
Well, I guess
that's everybody.
Very well.
Charter revoked.
We're back where we started.
No, not exactly.
This time we go down
on our own terms.
We've beaten you, Jerrod.
Good.
You'll have this little victory
to keep you warm
When you're out on the streets,
because now you're homeless.
See, that's what
you'll never understand
About guys like us,
brother Jerrod.
We might not be a fraternity
anymore,
We might not have a place
to live, but at least --
Oh, God! Where we gonna live?
Goodbye, gentlemen.
Brother Jerrod.
Number six.
You know,
ever since our meeting,
I've been thinking about
that question you asked me --
What positive thing had I
ever done to help these boys?
You didn't quite have an answer
for that one, did you?
No, I didn't.
I have to admit
that I was a little thrown
By all the research you had done
on my personal life.
So I did what any trained
academic would do.
I did a little research
of my own.
I made some calls,
And I talked to your wife,
Claire... In Lexington?
A lovely lady, by the way.
And Jerrod Junior sounds like
a real pistol.
I bet he has a lot
of his old man in him, huh?
Uh, yes, he does.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I think I can make Indiana State
if I leave.
Well, uh, I also talked
to your wife Allison...
In, uh, Lincoln,
Nebraska.
Again, a very,
very lovely young lady.
And with a son
named Jerrod Junior.
Somebody really loves the sound
of his own name.
Oh, my God.
Oh, and I also talked
to your fiancee Laura
In Champagne-Urbana.
Yeah.
She's very talkative.
I don't know how you do it.
What did you tell her?
Does Laura know
about Allison?
Does Allison know
about Claire?
Does little Jerrod Junior know
about Jerrod Junior?
Or the other
Jerrod Junior?
There's more juniors?
Uh, there might be.
<i>Now, I haven't said anything
to them yet.</i>
Do I need to?
Or is the sacrifice that these
boys just made enough for you?
Really,
I think we should all
Let each other slide a little
tonight.
Come on, guys.
You don't know what it's like
for me out there.
On the road 320 days a year
all alone?
A man can get lonely
out there!
All right! So I married a couple
of women along the way.
Nobody got hurt.
But I love my children,
Aloysius!
Come on, brothers.
I can count on my brothers,
can't I?
Are we still brothers?
Brother Smythe,
you are an honor to your house.
Thank you.
Why are calling me "caller,"
dude?
The name is Stankowski --
or Stank or Dank, okay?
And I don't want
General Public tickets, okay?
I'm trying to order a pizza.
So could you put Phil
on the line?
If you don't give it to me
right now,
I'm gonna be really hungry,
dude.
Ow.
What do you want?
Perverts, punks,
and poseurs, are you ready?
The one, the only...
General Public!
I can't help it!
That girl is amazing!
What?
I said she's amazing!
Thanks, man.
I appreciate that.
You're amazing, too!
Come here.
Give me a hug.
This is
the best night ever!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
