Clara was my babysitter.
I was only 12 years old,
naive and somewhat trusting.
But all that
was about to change.
You know how some babysitters
take you to the movies,
or roller-blading
in the park.
Mine brought me along on a
date with a serial killer.
Patrick Bateman.
Not my idea of a
romantic evening.
God, I mean, look at her.
All drugged up
and tied to a chair.
I knew we should have
gone to the movies.
At first, I was scared.
I wanted to get out of there
as fast as I could.
But then...
something came over me.
As soon as I was free,
I got really pissed.
He was about to make
a real mess of my babysitter.
So, I did what I believe many of you
would do in similar circumstances.
I took matters
into my own hands.
And it changed
my life forever.
Is everything
all right in there?
- I thought I heard a crash.
- Yes, everything’s fine. Thanks.
They found Bateman
and his final victim a few days later.
The FBI quickly
uncovered a psychopath,
and a few extra unsolved murders on him,
and he became an instant celebrity,
an overnight sensation.
I think they wrote
a book about him.
Only in America.
As for me?
I was never tied
to the scene.
And rather
than self-destruct,
or spend the rest of my life
on some shrink’s couch,
I told no one
of what had happened.
I silently vowed
to devote my life
to stopping
other psycho killers.
I couldn’t wait
to grow up.
The next six years
of my life were a blur.
My parents
wrote me off emotionally.
My mom became
a raging alcoholic,
and my dad was busy
fucking the secretary.
Pretty cliché, huh?
So, here I am today,
attending the most renowned behavioral
studies program in the nation.
Here they focus on profiling,
the art, craft and science
of tracking serial killers.
Of course, the subject matter
itself attracts some weirdos.
Hey, Rachael.
But then again,
maybe it’s just me...
The problem is,
I don’t have time for games.
I’ve got to focus
on my work.
- Come on, you can do better than that.
- That’s what your mama said.
And what can I say?
Studying murder often
brings out the best in people.
Thought you quit!
Getting into West
Washington wasn’t easy.
I busted my ass
in high school
and maintained a perfect
4.0 grade point average.
All this, so I could study
with the best mind in the field,
Pr. Robert Starkman.
Quite possibly the most revered
hunter of serial killers
the FBI ever produced.
After solving every high profile
crime ever thrown at him,
he suddenly made a startling
life change and became a teacher.
Some say it was his last case,
the mysterious death
of serial killer Patrick Bateman.
Good morning.
Funny how life works, isn’t it?
Good morning.
Starkman never discusses
the Bateman case...
Never.
Congratulations on getting through
the first half of the semester...
- alive.
- ( students laugh )
I have here...
the official application form
for the teacher’s assistant
position for next year.
This is my golden
ticket to Quantico,
the FBI’s elite
training program.
Unfortunately, everyone else
is here for the same reason.
They all  know that nine out
of Starkman’s last 10 teaching assistants,
- were accepted into the FBI.
- ...Announcing my new assistant for next year
by the end of the week, just before
we head off for Spring Break.
And, talking about
Spring Break,
don’t forget the party
at the Dean’s mansion.
We’ll have an opportunity
to say goodbye to Miss McGuire
who’s leaving us for bigger
and better things.
Well, after weeks of grueling,
if not gruesome work,
let’s have some fun, shall we?
Today we’ll be looking
at the unique aliases
the FBI, the press
and the general public
have nicknamed
serial killers, and why.
His present TA
is Elizabeth McGuire.
She’s already been
accepted to Quantico...
Early admissions.
I’m the front runner
to replace her.
Nobody comes close
to my rock solid GPA.
Dr. H.H. Holmes was
once vilified, in a biography,
as the "Arch Fiend.”
I’d like to say that none
of them have a chance,
but grades aren’t everything.
And I do have
some competition.
Contender number one:
Brian Leads.
A GPA as low as his
wouldn’t normally pose a threat.
But his family’s fortune,
easily numbering in hundreds
of millions, can open a lot of doors.
How do you think
he got into the school?
Can you spell "donation”?
He can’t.
Albert Fish,
AKA "The Moon Maniac”...
AKA "The Werewolf
of Wisteria.”
Contender two: Cassandra Blaire.
Rumor has it she and Starkman
have been going at it
since the beginning
of the semester.
But my guess: No way.
I mean, he’s old enough
to be her grandfather.
Nannie Doss...
"The Black Widow”
who murdered four of her husbands.
Contender three: Keith Lawson.
He poses the biggest
threat of the three.
He and I have been sparring
all year in this class.
But, I’ve yet to lose
a single round.
The fact is,
none of them have a chance.
Oh, Bobby.

Filling out the application
is a mere formality.
Come Friday, I <i>will</i> be Starkman’s
new teaching assistant.
The position is mine.
I deserve it
and I’m going to get it.
Yes, there maybe a few more hoops
I have to jump through,
but I can handle them.
Besides,
failure is not an option.
Why don’t we just
start over here,
because I highly suggest you
reconsider your position on this.
I’m sorry, Mr. Leads.
I can’t make any exceptions.
Your GPA is simply
not high enough.
Are you saying no to me?
Do you know who my father is?
Mr. Leads...
I am well aware
of your family’s legacy.
Heed my advice. A bird in the hand
is worth two in the bush.
That’s your fucking advice?
I have some advice for you.
Get ready to take a long vacation.
Go with God, dear heart.
Next!
Can you believe this shit?
Wait till she sees my GPA after
my cousin hacks into their mainframe.
Oh!
Do they give these things up
for bitch of the month?
That hag could be
the reigning champion.
She’s lucky I don’t bash
her brains in.
Next!
Hi.
I was told to drop off my teaching assistant
application here after I'm done with it.
Well, looks like
everything’s in order here.
Thank you.
Wait a second.
- What’s this?
- What?
It says here
that you’re a freshman.
Yeah, so what?
We don’t usually allow freshmen
or sophomores to become TAs.
You have to be
a Junior or above.
This isn’t
your usual situation.
Pr. Starkman already
told me I could apply.
Shouldn’t this decision be left up
to the professor, not the school?
‘Fraid not.
I’ll run this up the flagpole
and see who salutes.
I’ll have to speak
with your teacher.
Look, I have a schedule to keep.
It’s all worked out.
We do this for your
own good, dear.
Freshmen can be extremely
overwhelmed, being at college,
and away from home
for the first time in their lives.
Here, take this.
"Beat common freshmen fears
in 10 easy steps.”
So many new experiences.
It’s so exciting.
Look,
the only experience I want
is to be Pr. Starkman’s
TA next semester.
‘Fraid not!
It just wouldn’t be right.
I’m sure Pr. Starkman will put in
a good word for you,
but I don’t see how I can make
any exceptions at this point
without setting a dangerous
precedent in school policy.
I’ll be informing
the Dean of the situation.
I’m sorry, Miss Newman.
You’ll just have to wait.
Have a nice day.
- (door slams)
- Hmm.
Ricky Martin?
Ricky?
Ricky?
Come to mama.
Ricky?
Ricky Martin?
Ricky?
Ricky?
Oh!
Ricky, you got
some explaining to do.
Ricky?

- Oh, thank God.

Hey, Miss Newman.
Wow, Brian.
Are you stalking me now?
No, Rachael. If I was
stalking you, you’d know it.
I mean-- you wouldn’t know it.
You know?
Listen, I just thought we
should get together and...
discuss the state of the union
and just, life in general.
Get to the point, Brian.
My inside source says
he has narrowed it down.
Guess who’s still
in the running?
Keith, Cassandra
and me.
Unless you find some way to raise
your GPA in the next couple of days.
That problem’s
already solved.
So, do you want to catch
a bite to eat tomorrow night,
maybe some dinner
and discuss it?
And what’s to discuss?
It’s not like it was ever between anyone else.
We were always
the front runners.
Well, we could get together
and maybe form an alliance,
eliminate our competition.
Well, that sounds intriguing but...
- I have a paper to write.
- A paper? Listen, Rachael...
We should get to know
each other better.
Is it just me, or is there unspoken
sexual tension between us?
We should bring it to the surface
and stop lying to each other.
Are you on crack?
I don’t know. It was white,
it was in a pipe--
- So, what do you say?
- I told you. I have a paper to write.
No, no, no...
I'm not taking no for an
answer twice in one day.
You have to eat, right?
I have to eat. We both have to eat.
Let’s just eat together.
It’s no big deal.
Listen, I was just fucking around
with the sexual tension stuff.
I just throw stuff out there.
I’m crazy, I’m like a volcano,
just waiting to erupt--
Okay!
Okay, fine.
Just pick me up at 8:00.
- Eight? Like 8:00pm?
- Yeah.
- Between 7:00 and 9:00?
- Yeah!
Okay.
‘Cause
it’s great for me--
- I’ll see you at 8:00.
- Whatever.
Maybe I’ll be there
five minutes later.
So... what are you doing
for Spring Break?
I’m just gonna hang around
and get some work done.
What do you mean, "Hang around”?
You mean, like stay on campus?
Yeah.
You’re not going home?
Why?
Because I have work to do.
Besides, my family’s coming to visit.
It's my mom’s birthday...
and they want to see how
the other half lives.
- Okay, that sounds terrible.
- I know.
What are you doing?
Bobby’s taking me up to his cabin
in the Northern Cascade--
Cassandra, please don’t call
him Bobby in front of me.
I’m sorry.
Pr. Starkman
is taking me up to his cabin.
When do you guys leave?
He’s got to go upstate first,
to meet Diane and Louisa.
You mean, his wife
and his baby daughter?
Whatever!
Yes, them.
He’s meeting them at his
in-laws’ for the long weekend.
God, you know, I can’t stand how
much of his time they take up.
Cass, they’re his family!
Whatever.
Look, I’m late for a study session.
I should just go.
God, I can’t believe you’re
actually going out with Brian.
I mean, how did that happen?
Okay...
so, the other day, our eyes met
across a crowded room,
and there was this--
this spark,
the sign I’ve been waiting for
my whole life.
It was then that I knew
that Brian was my soul mate.
- Oh my God.
- I know.
- Really?
- No, not really.
It’s kinda great to be
here tonight with you.
- Mmm-hmm.
- Hi.
Hi. Can I get you
something to drink?
Yes, please. I’ll have a Kettle
One martini, straight up,
very dry.
Very, very dry.
And the lady will have...
- I’ll have a glass of house red.
- House red.
Good.
I’ll be right back.
- So, you look great.
- Thanks.
our hair is different.
It looks good.
- Thanks.
- No problem.
So, you know, it’s great that
we finally have some "us” time.
- Just you and I hanging out.
- I agree.
Yeah. Listen, Rach,
before we sort of,
embark on our evening,
I have a confession to make.
God, Brian, can you wait
until we get our drinks
before you start
making your confessions?
- Oh yeah, sure.
- Thanks.
Oh, look. Our drinks.
Thank you.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
It’s my first day.
So, ready to order?
Can you just, sort of,
give us a minute here?
Sure.
Just take your time.
Thank you.
Okay. So, what would you like to confess?
Well, this is difficult for me,
because I really want us
to remain friends after--
regardless of who Starkman picks
for the TA position.
Wow, I’m touched.
Brian, I really am.
But you should know that I’m very
determined to get the position.
You know, after the last few months,
I’ve been doing a little research
on Cassandra Blair.
What kind of research?
Well, let’s just say that
if she gets the position,
the Dean’s office is going
to receive an anonymous letter
regarding her and Starkman’s "relationship",
accompanied by some
very revealing photographs.
- How Christian of you.
- Thanks.
OK, so I guess that narrows it down to three.
Yeah.
You know
who my father is, right?
Yes, we’re all in awe
of your family’s money.
You know, you and Keith
are very smart.
So I’ve had to go
to great lengths
to ensure that my bright future
in the FBI goes without a hitch.
What are you
smiling at?
This.
That is the press release
for the new Carson-Leads
Behavioral Sciences Building.
It’s just one of my dad’s
new pet projects.
So...
I have an offer
you can’t refuse.
Drop out of the race
for the TA position,
and I’ll ensure that you have seven
digits of my family’s eternal gratitude.
Brian?
Are you bribing me now?
Bribe, Rachael?
Did I say bribe?
Just think of it
as a business opportunity.
Trust me,
the alternative wouldn’t be
too pleasant.
"I’ll let you be in my dreams
if I can be in yours.”
- What?
- It’s a quote.
Bob Dylan,
maybe you’ve heard of him?
- Oh, yeah.
- You know, Brian,
you should really
get out more.
Maybe I will.
The night’s young.
That it is.
Cheers.
Don’t!
- (mimicking trumpet)
- Shh!
We’re home, we’re home.
Wow!
This is like... a room.

Don’t worry, I’ll take care

Oh, the old
"pull out and pray” trick.
Great,
a Renaissance man.
Wait a second!
The convenience store,
down the street--
I’ll just go down there,
it’s right around the corner.
It’s really convenient
and I’ll get some, I’ll get tons.
Wait a minute,
what am I saying?
My roommate’s got tons of them,
drawers full of them.
I mean, It's like a
prophylactic factory.
Are we done here?
No. No, we’re not done.
Just wait here. I'm gonna walk down the hall,
and get some from a friend.
- Oh, great.
- Just make yourself comfortable.
Sure, great.
I’ll be here.
Jeez. A piss-sheet.
Jesus.
What the fuck.
(choking)
Ribbed, for<i> her</i>  pleasure.
Yep, I just killed Brian.
But you’ve got to look
at the positive side...
I’m killing for a better tomorrow.
Once I get into the FBI,
I’ll be in a position to stop dozens,
maybe even hundreds
of serial killers every year.
Okay, think about it...
I’m killing the few
to save the many.
Sort of like Robin Hood,
you know?
God, I think I need
some professional help.
So, Rachael, have you ever
been to a psychiatrist before?
No.
- No, how does it work?
- I works like this.
You want answers, so we get together,
we have weekly converations,
and together we ask the questions
that will lead you to your answers.
All right?
God, I could tell you anything,
and you’d still never know the real me.
Sure you could,
and that’s your choice.
But why would you
lie to me?
Because I don’t expose
my Achilles’ heel to anyone.
- Why do you say that?
- Look, all I'm saying is, I  need to be on watch.
If I’m not looking out
for number one, then who is?
It’s a dog-eat-dog-world
out there,
and my future depends on
not getting eaten by the other dogs.
I have schedules,
appointments, goals, and dreams
that only I'll be able to fulfill.
No one is going
to do that for me.
Who do you think is keeping you
from achieving these goals?
- Other people.
- What people?
Anyone who gets in my way.
If you could be anyone
in the world, except yourself,
who would that be?
Elizabeth McGuire.
Elizabeth McGuire?
Who’s she?
She’s Pr. Starkman’s present TA.
And the next in line
to go to Quantico.
- And Quantico is?
- My goal.
- My destiny.
- I see.
Have you ever wanted
something so bad
that you’d do
anything to get it?
Sure.
Go on.
And that’s why I went
to West Washington.
And I’ve always known that, really,
there were only three other people
who could steal the TA position
away from me.
What happens
if you don’t get the position?
Oh, I can’t even consider that.
No, no failure is not an option.
I will get the position.
- How can you be so sure?
- Because I am.
- Why don’t we stop there?
- Okay.
My secretary will get
your billing info on the way out.
Okay.
So, same time next week?
- You bet.
- Okay.
(dialing)
- (phone rings)
- Starkman.
Hey, Bobby.
It’s Eric.
Hey, Eric.
What’s up?
Hey, look Bobby, I just had a first
time session with one of your students.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...
Aren’t we violating
some sort of privacy code here?
Yes and no.
I’ll tell you what...
I won’t tell you the name,
if you promise not to say it out
loud once you’ve figured it out.
- Is that a deal?
- Okay. Fire away.
All right.
I think I’ve identified this person
as a textbook sociopath.
That seems to be a prerequisite for
getting into college in the first place.
Tell me about it. Still, this girl
has no concept of reality
or the difference
between right or wrong.
A girl.
Mmm, the plot thickens.
She’s obsessed with becoming
your assistant next semester.
Well, if that’s her
obsession, it’s no big deal.
These kids seem to think
I’m their ticket to the FBI.
Just keep your eyes open.
This girl--
she scared me.
Jesus, Eric, if she’s that dangerous,
maybe you'd better tell me her name
before she turns up
in class with an AK47.
You know I can’t do that. I’ve already
broken the law by placing this call.
Just be aware that there's a
student like this in your class.
What exactly do you mean,
"be aware”?
25 years in the FBI...
turn your radar on.
Just make sure
she doesn’t get out of hand.
- She’s already identified three of her peers--
- Dr. Daniels?
- Okay, okay, Mother.
- Mom?
I’ve got to go,
I’ve got an appointment downtown.
I love you. I do.
I love you too.
Okay, I’ll see you
this weekend. Bye.
Rachael?
I am so sorry to disturb you.
I didn’t realize
you were on the phone
- and your secretary was away from her desk.
- It’s okay.
I just left my keys here.
You know, I am such a
textbook nut case sometimes.
I’d probably lose my head
if it wasn’t screwed on.
Oh, there they are.
It’s so nice that you stay
in touch with your mom.
- How old is she?
- 72.
Wow.
72, that’s a great age.
So many new and exciting things,
the golden years.
Grandchildren?
No. I’m--
My wife and I
never had children.
Was she not able to?
Actually, Rachael, we’re divorced.
You know, I have another
patient coming in soon.
And I have to prepare for them.
So I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.
Now, which is it, Eric?
An appointment downtown
or a patient in your office?
I mean, it’s not nice to lie
to your dear old mom.
See you next week.

After my session with

You see, the Anthony Perkins character
in <i>Psycho</i> was modeled on Ed Gein.
My heart rate nearly triples
when I get to the party
and see that the vultures have
already descended upon Starkman.
He broke the mold because he only
killed two people in his entire career.
I must have
lost track of time running on.
I had planned to get
here early to get
as much face-time
with Starkman as possible.
And now I’m late.
This is a disaster.
Bitch!
...e inspiration for Leatherface
in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre--
- Hello, Miss Brown.
- I’ll be right back.
It’s good to see you.
- Hey, Rach, how is it going?
- Hey!
So, how was your date with Brian?
Oh, fine. Short, I guess.
I don’t know.
Short?
How short was he?
I mean, "it.”
We didn’t get that far.
He went home after dinner.
What do you mean? Why did you come by
my room last night to borrow a rubber,
- if he went home right after dinner?
- Why are you giving me the third degree?
Look, I’m just confused, is all.
Did you guys get it on or not?
Look, I don't think it's
any of your business.
- Can we drop this, please?
- Whatever.
You know, sometimes I just don’t
get what's going on in your head.
It’s like you’re not even here.
What did you do
last night?
- Bobby came over for--
- Cassandra!
I’m sorry. Pr. Starkman
came over for a study session.
And let me assure you,
it was definitely not short.
Oh, I’m gonna vomit.
What are you smiling at, freak?
Come here.
Bob--
I mean the professor,
told me I’m a shoe-in
for the TA position next year.
I mean, I wasn’t
supposed to tell anyone,
but since you and I are so close
I figured I could share...
I was gonna burst.
Just think, now I get to spend
all this time with my sweetie.
And his wife's just gonna
think we’re working.
Oh hey, wait a minute, maybe
I’ll even get to go to Quantico.
How great would that be?
Just make sure you don’t
tell anyone, okay?
- Not even Brian.
- You know what, Cass, don’t worry.
Your secret is safe with me.
This party’s such a dud.
Why don't we just blow it off
and you can give me all the details.
Perfect. Just let me
talk to Starkman,
and then we can go to Jittery
Joes, grab a coffee.
No! It’s way
too crowded.
You don’t want anyone
to know about you and Bobby.
Why don't we grab a bottle
of wine and go to your room.
That sounds great!
Just make sure
you don’t tell anyone, okay?
- Don’t let me down.
- Don’t worry,
I would never
let you down.
It's like I said, Cassie,
student-teacher relationships
just never work out.
(phone rings)
It’s Cassandra, I can’t get
to the phone right now,
so leave a quickie
and I’ll get back to ya, bye.
Hello Cassandra.
Pr. Starkman here.
Listen, it’s 11:25 and
you missed your study session.
Call me back to reschedule.
Doctor Daniels?
I’m sorry to drop in
without an appointment,
but there is something
on my mind.
Sure.
Sure, Rachael.
- How are things with you?
- Oh, they couldn’t be better.
Really?
Any word
on that TA job yet?
He's not going to announce it
until the day before Spring Break.
When does that start
for you guys?
- End of the week.
- Really?
- Two days?
- Yeah.
- And how do you feel about that?
- Pretty confident.
- So, you think you’ll get the job?
- Oh, I don’t think, Eric. I know.
Okay, Rachael.
Worst case scenario:
you don’t get the job.
What then?
What are you talking about,
Dr. Daniels?
It’s mine.
I know you want me to come up with some
informed idea of what’s wrong with me,
but I’ll be honest. I came here today...
to tell you I’m not
coming back next week.
Don’t worry, I have every intention
to pay for your time.
However, I feel the problem we have
connecting lies mostly with you.
Look, this is a small town.
My guess is you know
almost everyone here.
You were born here, right?
It must be so disappointing
to see all these college kids
come in and out
of your town every year,
moving on to bigger
and better opportunities,
while you stay here, year after year,
getting older and older.
And all while taking care
of your dear old mom.
And on top of this,
you’re divorced?
God! The female
population in this town,
aside from the sexy little
college girls running around,
must be pretty weak.
This alone would cripple any man.
Your level of frustration
must be through the roof.
A dead-end job
with no love life,
all while taking care
of your sick mom.
Just the other day,
I noticed you were judging me.
Is that fair?
I mean really, is that?
I don’t think so.
Your life is very similar
to Ed Gein’s.
Ed Gein?
Yes, Ed Gein.
Very famous serial killer.
A bachelor, raised
by his domineering mother,
until she died when he
was roughly your age.
God, he went nuts!
He couldn’t handle the loss.
I wonder what would happen
to you without your mother?
Okay Rachael, that’s enough.
You don’t know me,
and I don’t know you.
We're in the process of
getting to know each other.
That's what these sessions are, a process.
So don’t go jumping to conclusions.
No. I’m not jumping
to any conclusions here.
If you just open up your eyes,
you’d see I’m already there.
Have a good day, Doctor.
Let’s talk about Ted Bundy
for a minute, shall we?
What kind
of a killer was he?
How was he perceived?
Mr. Lawson wishes to participate.
Please, let’s hear it.
He was perceived
as a very organized killer.
- Very calculated.
- Hmphf!
You don’t agree,
Miss Newman?
Yes and no.
Come on, this guy planned
each and every detail in advance.
He chose his victims with extreme
accuracy, he stalked them meticulously,
and waited for the absolute
precise moment to attack.
All while maintaining
an air of patience
not even the FBI’s
greatest could penetrate.
- No offense, sir.
- None taken.
- Oh, but I still don’t agree.
- On top of that, he picked all his dumping sites
ahead of time with the utmost caution.
He was unquestionably
an organized killer.
- Premeditated, with a capital "P.”
- Capital "P”?
- It’s a letter in the alphabet.
- (students giggle)
Between
"O” and "Q.”
You have something to say, Miss Newman?
He started out organized,
but spiraled downward late
in his so-called career.
He began to keep bodies for days,
<i>meticulously</i>  washing their hair
and even applying make-up
before disposing of them.
And he littered the dumping sites with
evidence, using the <i>utmost caution</i>.
However, his last victim,
and his youngest girl ever,
fell out of his typical
victim selection.
She was chosen out
of sheer availability.
The sheer need to kill.
He was both,
an organized killer
and off-the-charts lunatic.
- With a capital "L.”
- (classroom laughs)
You’re right.
He was both.
Very impressive,
Miss Newman.
Now, Pr. Starkman,
how would you classify a killer
whose downward spiral was actually
calculated into their grand scheme?
That’s a very interesting
hypothesis, Miss Newman.
Unfortunately, in this class,
we stick to the facts.
And there’s no known
case-study of that nature.
Keith’s little display of
brainpower in class today
was totally unacceptable.
I mean, it’s a day before
Starkman announces his new TA.
This could be catastrophic.
I wasn’t about to watch years
of hard work go down the drain.
It was time
to pick Keith’s brain.
You know that warm feeling you get
when you realize that there are
people out there just like you?
It almost makes you feel normal.
I mean, all this time,
I thought he was taking notes.
But no. Look at his work,
his sketches.
They’re absolutely brilliant.
This may be a waste
of a rare mind.
But, a girl’s gotta do
what a girl’s gotta do.
Hi, Pr. Starkman.
- Hey!
- Miss Brown.
- How are you?
- Good.
So, the big day’s tomorrow,
right?
- What do you mean?
- For the TA position.
- You’re announcing it tomorrow?
- Yes, of course.
- At noon, in my classroom.
- I can’t wait.
I think my chances are much better
this year than they were last.
I would think so.
It’s a very tight race this year.
Mmm-hmm.
So, were you looking for Cassandra?
Because, I mean, she wasn’t in class.
So she probably left for
Spring Break quite early.
- Well, actually, the--
- It’s Cassandra, isn’t it?
She got the position.
Good for her, but--
I can’t say that I’m not disappointed,
but "what doesn’t kill you only
makes you stronger.” Right?
I’ll see ya.
(gasp)
(phone rings)
(rings again)
Hi, it’s Cassandra.
I can’t get to the phone right now,
so leave a quickie and
I’ll get back to ya, bye.
(beep)
(phone rings)
- Hello?
- Eric, for God’s sakes!
She’s dead!
- Who is?
- She is!
The "she” whose name
we agreed not to say aloud.
My patient? Dead? How?
She hung herself.
You didn’t say
she was suicidal.
She had suicidal tendencies,
but I was more concerned
for the sociopathic
and homicidal patterns
that were emerging.
Spare me your psychobabble
bullshit.
This girl...
she may have been a little forward,
but she wasn’t crazy!
I’m sorry you disagree, Bobby,
but you didn’t see what I saw.
- This girl was not a pretty picture.
- Listen, Eric,
I spent a lot of time
with this girl,
and I gotta tell ya,
I don’t agree with you on this one.
There are tons of kids in your classes.
How could you possibly know her
as well as you think you did?
We’re bound by the guidelines
of doctor-patient privilege, right?
You didn’t, Bob?
You weren’t sleeping with her?
Hell, no wonder she was
obsessing over you.
- Bobby, how could you do this to Diane?
- None of your fucking business.
Fine. Why did you call
me in the first place?
‘Cause you’re
my fucking shrink!
I’m sorry, Eric. I just
needed someone to talk to.
I loved her.
Eric, can you get me some Valium?
Yeah. I’ll call it in to the pharmacy.
- Can I give you some advice?
- (phone beeps)
- (dial tone)
- Hello?
So, here we are. The big day.
In moments, I’ll be crowned
Starkman’s new TA,
and be one step closer to the FBI.
Oh, it's too bad Brian, Cassie and Keith
couldn’t be here to watch me.
But wherever they are,
I’m sure they’ll realize they
did not give up their lives in vain.
I will make them proud.
Guys, can I have
your attention, please?
Pr. Starkman
told me to tell you
that unfortunately he’s decided
that his sabbatical,
which was scheduled
for next year,
is now effective
immediately.
In other words, there’ll be
no TA position for next semester.
Sorry.
Have a great Spring Break.

Pr. Starkman?
Pr. Starkman?
Rachael.
Why--
why haven’t you gone home?
I’ll just hang around here during the break.
Why?
Don’t you have family that's
waiting at home for you?
No.
No, actually, they’re gonnal come visit me here.
Are you okay, Professor?
I heard about the change in plans.
Is that why you’re here?
Is that all you people ever think about?
The goddamn teaching assistant job?
Quantico?
Don’t you kids get it?
It’s not even that important.
Well, it’s important to me.
I have a schedule,
a plan, a dream. I need it!
What makes you think you’re gonna get it?
Other students have
applied too, you know?
- Some more qualified than you.
- I beg your pardon?
I believe I am the most qualified for this position.
Name someone who’s more
dedicated or intelligent,
that’s had more experience than me.
You don’t even know what
you’re talking about.
Go on home.
- What are you doing?
- Shh.
Just relax, Bobby.
Where did you get that?
And the dress?
- What’s going on here?
- Bobby, what’s wrong?
Don’t fuck with me.
That necklace...
And Cassandra’s dress.
It was a present.
Bobby, don’t you remember?
You gave it to me.
Stop it...
this instant!
I said, go home.
I mean it.
Look, I have a confession to make.
I’ve had feelings for you for
a long time now, Bobby...
longer than you can imagine.
I’ve always wanted something
to happen between us.
Something beautiful.
I love you, Bobby.
- What?!
- Please, don’t be upset, Bobby.
Stop calling me Bobby!
Okay. I’m a little confused.
You're confused? How do you think I feel?
Rachael-- Ms. Newman...
- this is unacceptable.
- Oh, it is?
But it was okay for you and Cassandra?
How did--
I don’t know what
you’re talking about. Leave.
I’ve always loved you.
Ever since I first saw you.
Before Diane ever loved you.
Before Cassandra ever loved you.
Before Clara even ever loved you.
It was always me.
Don’t you get it?
How did you know about Clara?
That was six years ago.
I was there, Bobby.
- Clara was babysitting me that night.
- Clara.
He’s here! Do something.
I was in Bateman’s apartment.
Clara used to baby-sit me all the time.
She’d tell me about
your relationship with her.
She’d show me pictures of you.
You were my first crush.
You were in Patrick Bateman’s apartment...
the night he killed Clara?
Yeah.
I know you quit the FBI
because of what happened to her.
I think you blame yourself for her death.
Bobby, all work, no play.
- You want to play?
- Uh-huh.
Okay.
But she was the one who looked through
your stuff and found the file on Bateman.
She’s the one who tracked him down.
And she went to his apartment
that night and dragged me along.
Rich and good-looking.
Remind me why we're together again?
You shouldn’t blame yourself.
She was going over there to cheat on you.
Did you know that?
- Did you know she was a slut?
- Shut up!
It’s the truth, OK?
She got what she deserved.
And so did Cassandra. She thought
you didn’t love her enough.
It’s my turn now.
I’ve waited for this for over six years.
I won’t let anyone get in my way,
not even Diane and your baby girl.
Don’t you threaten my family.
Oh, so now you care about your family?
You just can’t hold a
relationship together, can you?
- Please.
- You think you’re the catch of a lifetime.
Old man, you’re just the
opportunity of a lifetime.
- Stop.
- After you can’t break anymore hearts,
you’ll still break one more...
your baby daughter’s.
Please, no more.
Goodbye, Bobby.

I sure do hope you’ve got--
Holy shit.
(car door closes)
- What the hell’s going on here?
- Oh, that?
That’s Pr. Starkman.
He’s a little out of it tonight.
(groan)
(dialing)
(ringing)
You’ve reached Pr. Starkman,
in the Behavioral Sciences Department.
Please, leave a message.
Hey, Bobby, it’s Eric.
I felt bad about the other day.
I just wanted to say I’m sorry.
And I hope you got
that prescription filled okay.
So, call me if you need anything.
Bye.
(phone rings)
- Dr. Daniels’ office.
- Mary, if that’s Bobby Starkman,
- I’ll take it in here.
- He’ll take you at 3:00. All right.
It was for an appointment,
not the professor.
Okay.
I put her in at 3:00,
That really intense girl, Rachael Newman.
She wanted to come in today.
What?
Rachael Newman?
Are you sure?
Yeah. Eric, are you okay?
I can reschedule her if you want.
I’m--
no, I’m-- I’m fine.
It’s just--
it’s been a long day.
- Okay, let me know if you need anything.
- Sure.
Bye.
Bye, Mary.
- (ringing)
- Come on.
You’ve reached Pr. Starkman
in the Behavioral Sciences Department.
Please, leave a message.
Yeah, Bobby, it’s Eric again.
Call me when you get this, alight?
I’m really confused about something.
If you don’t reach me by 3:00,
I’ll drop by your office
between 4:00 and 4:30.
Okay, bye.
(knocking on door)
- Hi, honey!
- Mom!
- Dad?
- We made it!
Hello, princess.
Aren’t you gonna invite us in?
Jeez, I’m sorry.
Yes, please, come in.
Wow!
Hi, happy birthday!
Thank you, sweetie.
Oh, we’ve been planning this for months.
Sweet Jesus! It smells
like somebody died in here.
The toilet’s clogged up and
maintenance isn’t up and running,
- so there’s nothing I can do.
- That’s wretched.
Oh, sweetheart, you are
such a clothes-horse.
- What am I gonna do with you?
- Don’t open the closet, Mom.
-Your present’s in there.
- Oh, I’m sorry, sweetie.
Look at me, always almost
spoiling the surprise.
Well, when are we gonna eat?
I’m hungry.
Oh, good. I made reservations for 5:30.
I’m going out of town with a
friend of mine later tonight, so.
Well, is this restaurant
reasonably priced?
Yes.
Is there an early bird special?
- I don’t think so.
- Oh, that’s too bad.
- What’s it called?
- Chez Gerard’s.
Is that Italian? You know, your father
cannot digest Italian food.
- It’s too spicy.
- Mother, it’s French.
French!
- Oh, how sophisticated!
- Yeah, okay.
I’ve got to finish packing
and finish writing some term papers.
So why don’t you guys
go back to the motel...
and we’ll meet back at the
restaurant at, say, 5:30?
Sounds good to me.
I’ve got to use the head.
You really gotta get maintenance up here.
Daddy, I called.
Now, how will we ever find this place?
We’ll be back at 5:15
to pick you up.
- Okay.
- Bye, princess.
I love you, guys.
- (ringing)
- You’ve reached Pr. Starkman
in the Behavioral
Sciences Department.
- Please, leave a message.
- (beep)
Hey, Bobby, it’s Eric. I know
you’re going through some tough times,
but she--
the she who hung herself--
she made an appointment to see me today.
I don’t know if this is some kind of joke,
but something’s not right.
Call me when you get this, all right?
Roses are red,
violets are blue,
the Daniels will soon
be calling back you.
Mom, you’ve really got
to change that message.
I’ll come by around 5:30
to pick you up for our big date.
And I’ll make sure to get you back in time
for <i>Murder She Wrote</i>. Alright, bye.
- Bon appetit.
- Happy birthday, Mom.
(gasp)
Oh, it’s gorgeous.
Oh, this is the most beautiful thing
I have ever received in my life.
How ever did you afford it?
- Stainless steel.
- It’s silver, you old lump.
Stainless steel.
Silver has...
that distinguished look about it.
Anyway,
as I was saying before,
I said to Leora she ought
to have it looked at immediately.
So what does she do? She waits an entire
month before she sees the doctor.
And then when she finally does see him,
he orders a biopsy
and it comes back positive.
Well, could you just die?
I mean, if she had
only taken my advice,
she could have avoided
this entire mess!
I know we’re going to eat dinner
at some point and time.
- The question is, when?
- Excuse me, I'm gonna go use the restroom.
Don’t forget to wash your hands.
Now, where is my steak knife?
My mother drives me crazy.
Now, I know that sounds pretty cliché,
but how many people actually envision
carving into their mother’s neck
and yanking out her vocal cords?
Or ripping her tongue out and serving
it to her as an early-bird special?
- Bonsoir.
- Bonsoir. Daniels. Table for two.
Great. I’ve got a table
right here for you.
- Thank you.
- After you.
Why don’t you sit
on the other side?
Get a view of the whole thing.
Excusez-moi, garcon.
Could I have
un autre, uh...
steak knife, s’il-vous-plait?
Oh.
- Of course. Voila, madame.
- Merci.
How about a table closer to the window?
- That would be very nice.
- Okay, I’ll ask.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
I was wondering if we could get
a table a little closer to the window.
That section is closed
for Spring Break.
Sorry.
Uh, no problem. I understand.
This table is fine.
Good. So, can I get you
something to drink?
I’ll have a whiskey sour. Mom?
I’ll need some water
so I can take my pills.
As I stare at myself in the mirror,
I realize that I can’t let my
mother get the best of me.
I’m Robert Starkman’s next TA.
And that is where
I'm going to focus my energies.
I should set up a meeting with Bobby
when I get back to the dorm.
Maybe we can brainstorm
at his cabin tonight.
I’ll make him my special eggs.
Sorry.
Ready to order?
Maybe you’d give us
a little bit more time?
Sure. Of course.
I’ll be just over there.
- Take your time.
- Thank you.
- Cheers.
- Cheers, my dear. Cheers.
Oh my God.
Hello, Dr. Daniels.
It’s great to see you.
And this must be your mother.
Well hello, Mrs. Daniels.
How are you doing this evening?
Oh, I’m fine, dear.
Oh my God.
I just love that hat.
I would kill for a hat like that.
It is just so cute!
You know what? I have to be
getting back to my table.
- It was great meeting you.
- It was very nice meeting you too, sweetheart.
See you later, Eric.
Who is that pretty girl?
A new girlfriend, I hope.
No.
She’s a patient.
A very sick patient.
- Would you excuse me for a second.
- Yes, of course, dear.
- I’ll be right back.
- Yes.
Excuse me. Sorry
to interrupt your dinner.
I’m a friend of your daughter’s.
Ms. Newman,
could I have a word
with you for a moment?
Sure.
Mom, Dad, I’ll be just a minute.
Excuse me.
That’s it. I’m eating.
Didn’t he just call her
a different name?
Alright, you have some explaining to do.
First of all, you insult me.
Then you threaten my mother.
You’re having an affair with a married man.
Then I hear that you’ve hung yourself.
And now you act as if none of this ever happened.
- So, what is going on?
- Wait, you heard I hung myself?
Yes.
Eric, why would you say that?
Let’s just say a mutual friend
told me that he found you hanging.
Dead.
- Is this some sort of sick joke?
- He never found me. He found her.
Her who?
You know what, it doesn’t even matter anymore.
It’s not that important.
What’s important is it's my mom’s
birthday, and I'm here with her.
I’ll catch up with you later.
Goodbye.
Honey, why did he call you Ms. Newman?
I don’t know Mom.
Could we just eat, please?
- I have to go home and pack.
- Oh honey, can’t you cancel?
We never get a chance to see you.
Look Mom, I wish I could, but I can’t.
- They’re very special plans.
- A boy?
- Yes, it’s a boy.
- Aww. What’s his name?
Bobby Starkman.
Bobby?
- Hey, Jim.
- Hey, Dr. Daniels.
Can I offer you a cup of this
apricot-peppermint blend I got from New York?
Thanks, Jim. Listen, I think we
might have a bit of trouble.
- Is Harv in?
- Yeah, he’s in the back.
Hey, if it ain't old Siggy Freud, himself!
- What’s the good word, Doc?
- Not much, Harvey.
I want to file a missing person’s
report on Robert Starkman.
- You’re kidding?
- I wish I was.
His wife Diane called not 20 minutes ago
trying to do the same thing.
Yeah, apparently he didn’t show up at his
in-laws’ upstate like he was supposed to.
- You’re kidding?
- I wish I was.
- It’s been a crazy year for that kinda thing.
- What do you mean?
Well, it’s the third MPR we’ve filed
this year. Right, Jimmy?
- That’s a record around these parts, Doc.
- Who else was there?
Let’s have a look.
I’ve got a brand new one here.
A woman, Gerty Fleck,
from Student Services.
Just up and disappeared.
And of course, the Newman girl.
- Newman?
- Yeah, about 7 months ago...
A student, by the name of
Rachael Newman, disappeared.
The first day of the Fall semester, actually.
Jimmy and I toodled up onto
the campus to check it out.
And guess what?
I’m Sheriff Winslow, and this is Deputy Duncan.
Just looking for a--
- Are you Rachael Newman?
- Yeah. Why, what’s wrong?
We’re just checking on a MPR on yourself.
You’re not missing, are you?
No, I’m okay.
She was there,
completely unharmed.
Are you sure I couldn’t
offer you a cup of tea?
No, thanks, Jim.
I actually know
this Rachael Newman girl.
I gotta be honest with you,
I don’t trust her one bit.
Are you telling me the parents
just dropped the report?
I never said nothing about
parents, there, Doc.
The Newman girl, she was an orphan.
The report was filed by
some student friends of hers.
- But like I said, it was a false alarm.
- How do you know it was the right girl?
Well, there’s only one Rachael Newman
registered at West Washington.
Can I convince you guys
to come to the campus with me
to make sure everything’s okay?
Yeah, no problem, Doc.
- Should I get in here?
- Yeah, that’s fine.
(phone ringing)
You’re reached Pr. Starkman
in the Behavioral Sciences Department.
Please, leave a message.
Hey Bobby, it’s me.
I’m almost done packing here.
I’ll be there soon.
I hope you’re as excited as I am.
Hey, if you need me
to pick up anything from the store,
I’ll be here another five minutes.
Otherwise, I'll see you soon.
I love you. Bye.
God, you stink.
Now, how did you get open?
You were'nt trying to sneak
out on me now, were you?
I just brought you up and
you’re already causing problems.
Don’t fall apart
on me now, Rach.
Wow! I like your room.
Actually,
I like your name too.
Rachael.
I mean, you don’t mind if I
borrow it for a bit, do you?
Right, well, this is a wild-goose
chase, I guess, Jimmy.
- You have a good day, alright?
- You too. Thank you, Officers.
Hey, Mom, I know
I’ve been out of touch,
but I got accepted
to West Washington.
I know.
Can you believe it?
It’s so sad about your parents.
The whole car accident thing and all.
So tragic.
Must have been hard
growing up an orphan.
But, I gotta tell you, I’m sure glad
you shared it with me.
Oh, Bobby.
Now, I told you to get
your beauty sleep.
We have a long night ahead of us.
Uhh, you’re<i> disgusting</i>.
So, I’m two cans of gas
and a brick away from Quantico.
All I've got to do is dot the "I's"
and cross the "T's", and I’m home free.
Look out!
- Jesus jumped up--!
- I think that was the Newman girl!
We’re on the move, boys!
Hang on!
Not now, Bobby.
Just wait till we get to the cabin.
I’ll make you a fire.
I’ll heat you up <i>real</i>  good.
Well, I think this qualifies
as breaking the speed limit.
- Don’t you think?
- Doing?
60...
- in a 35.
- Yeah.
She’s coming up on Old Mill Bend, boys.
She’ll slow down for the curve there.
- That's where we’ll take her.
- Alright, just ake it easy.
- We don’t want anyone getting hurt.
- It’s all under control, Doc.
That’s 275 bucks.
- Can you pull up next to her?
- Yeah, for a bit.
Jesus!
- Can you do something?
- Yeah. Take the wheel, Doc.
She’s slowing down.
That did the trick.
Doc, you stay here.
Just be careful.
She’s a loose cannon.
It’s all part of the job, right Jimmy?
Ma’am.
Ma’am, you wanna open the door.
Come on!
Come on, guys.
Don’t let her get away!
This don’t look good.
Jesus.
- What in the hell?
- Don’t let it be Bobby.
Christ!
Bobby.
How the hell...
Starkman.
- Where the heck is our lady friend?
- (tires screeching)
Come on.
Bobby.
(explosion)
Jesus!
Bobby.
A bizarre killing spree finally
came to an end last night
when 18-year-old West Washington student
Rachael Newman, now identified...
Rachael Newman’s killing
spree is believed to have begun
Wednesday evening with
the murder of Gertrude Fleck...
The body of Cassandra
Blair was found
- hanging in her...
- Brian Leeds’ body,
- from the Leeds family...
- Keith Lawson was...
The bodies
of a West Washington security guards
- were found within hours...
- Once a typical All-American girl,
Rachael Newman’s death
leaves many questions unanswered.
The most burning question
of all: Why?
As a case-study,
Rachael Newman
was as rare as they come.
She was more obsessed than Dahmer,
she was more calculating than Bundy,
and certainly more faceless than Bateman.
In a perfect world, she’d still be alive.
But for her, it all ended...
in a blaze of fire
in which she and her final victim,
a friend of mine,
Robert Starkman--
they burned to death.
I wish I had a chance
to study her mind more,
but all we ended up
with were dental records.
All in all, she killed eight people.
Eight people which we know of.
Rachael Newman is one in a billion.
One in a billion.
She’s in a league of her own.
But she will remain a
constant and strong reminder
that people aren’t always
what they seem to be.
Thanks for taking the
time to come out.
- Thank you for coming, Doctor.
- It’s a pleasure.
- Who should I make it out to?
- Louis Okon.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
- Can I have a different pen?
- Here you go.
- Who should I make it out to?
- Elizabeth...
- Elizabeth McGuire.
- McGuire.
Your work is so inspiring.
It’s a huge honor to meet you.
If you could be anyone in the world,
- who would that be?
- Elizabeth McGuire,
Pr. Starkman’s present TA,
and the next in line to go to Quantico.
- You can’t be?
- What, Eric?
One in a billion?
Hello, Dr. Daniels--
- Do you know that girl?
- Who?
- Elizabeth McGuire.
- You mean, Agent McGuire.
She’s the first Quantico
student in history
to be drafted into the Bureau
in her sophomore year.
Are you all right, Doctor?
It’s like they say...
"The brightest futures
are based on forgotten pasts.”
In the end, I did put Dr. Daniels
in a bit of a pickle.
But you’ve got to give to take, you know?
He gets his national best-seller,
which is ever so flawed...
I wonder how he sleeps at night,
knowing I still walk the streets.
Me?
I need for him to know.
What’s the point of pulling off
the perfect set of murders,
to realize my dream, if there isn’t
someone alive who knows about it?
It would be as if
I’d done nothing at all.
