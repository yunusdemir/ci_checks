THE QUIET FAMILY
It's been 13 days since we
moved here from the city
And still,
nothing has happened
Musty Inn
Misty Inn
My father bought this lodge
at a bargain from
the village headman, Mr. Park
Even when he knew nothing
about the lodging business
At first, everyone worked
hard with high hopes
Well, not exactly everyone
But day by day our hopes
turned into shattered dreams
Wait a minute!
Where the hell is Chang-ku?
Uncle went to town
early this morning
Young-min,
take your hands out
He's never around
when I need him
Okay, here they come!
- Wow, so many...
- Quiet
Stupid bastards!
Hope it rains on them
or something!
I'll get it!
Hello, this is the lodge
What? A lodge?
Yes, this is Misty Lodge
So, it's not the Dragon Palace?
What number did you call?
I called a Chinese restaurant
Chinese restaurant?
No, it's a mountain lodge
Maybe you have Chinese food?
Look, mister!
We got nothing
that's remotely Chinese!
- Sorry
- Hang up!
The nerve of that lunatic
Who does he think we are?
Unless his father hangs himself
to death with Chinese noodles,
he'll never learn
This burns me up
At least, Mr. Park's news of
a road pavement near the lodge
gave my folks some hope
But the road construction's delay
discouraged them again
And that was when everyone
became more and more
visibly hysterical
Die!
Die!
You die!
Quiet
Uncle, cut it out!
I hid that
blood-dripping head here
Now, why is it up there,
damn it?
Damn you!
What are you doing up there?
Your place is here, not there!
Get back to your place!
Get the hell away from there!
Something evil has gotten to you!
Kaaack tweiya!
Better watch out or else
something awful will happen
Kaaack tweiya!
Damn you,
get the hell out of here!
Get the hell out of here now!
Damn you!
Kwaaack tweit!
That's not it
Can't you do it right?
She never went 'Kwack tweit'
It was Kaack tweiya!
Kyaack twei?
No, no, do it again
Who do you take after?
Are you that stupid?
Uncle!
Shut up!
What the hell
is this at the table?
Mina!
Stop it!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom, the hikers are here!
Come out!
Come on,
let's rest here and then climb
Please, Young-jin?
Why bother when we can get
down before dusk, huh?
We need energy to climb up
that steep mountain
Need energy?
That's a nice way to put it
We'll probably stay up all night
Well, you do what you want
Darling, just for a little while
Maybe I can convince her
No thanks,
it's our business
Young-jin!
You won't get laid in
a million years like that!
I'm all by myself
In this Ionely lodge
Where the leaves
Keep on falling one by one...
Of all the songs,
she had to sing that one!
That's the way our kids are
She sure is breaking
my heart with that song
At least
she's good at something
It's so melancholy!
- Someone's coming
- Who is?
- Misoo!
- Stop it!
Doesn't seem like a hiker
Maybe he's from town
What do you want?
Is this a lodge?
Yes
Can I have a room?
Yes!
- What's the room number?
- 203
I want three bottles
of cold beer in my room
Yes, thank you
What a bummer!
He was our first customer
and he just went up
Then did you expect him
to play with you?
How much did you charge him?
30,000 won for the room
and 10,000 won for 3 beers
He gave Young-min 1,000 won
because he didn't need it
Even a beggar would tip
more than 1,000 won
By the way,
didn't he look a bit strange?
It doesn't matter
what he looked like
Well, I haven't seen any other
family look stranger than ours
Think Mina's face
is that of a 17 year-old?
What a lousy thing to say
about your own daughter
Uncle, didn't he
look a little weird?
I thought the man
was a dwarf
That's not what I meant
What then?
He probably thinks
we're the weirdos
No but I got this feeling
When I took the beer to
his room...
With side dishes?
Yes!
Put it there and leave
I got your change
You keep it,
I won't need it anymore
Hey kid, do you know
what Ioneliness is?
So what did you say?
I told him that I wasn't a kid
Then what?
He said okay
and told me to leave
Man, he really must think
we're all so weird
Anyway,
he had that look on his face
How can I put it?
He was like Ioneliness itself
Is he going to eat or what?
Mister, it's time to check out
- Young-min!
- Yeah!
Bring me the key
Draw the curtains
What is it?
Ouch, my back
Damn it
- What's with them?
- Don't know
Is it suicide?
Think someone came here
and murder him then?
That's not what I meant
Who'd think to stab himself
like that with a key?
Shouldn't we call the police?
Yes, let's call the police
Do you want
this place closed down?
What if it's not a suicide?
Look through his things
He may have left a will
There's nothing
Not a thing
That's strange
I'm sure he paid
from his wallet
It was full of money, too
Why stare at me?
Go and get some bags and
a shovel from the warehouse
To do what?
What do you mean 'what'?
We'll bury him in the woods
What?
But we've got nothing
to do with his death
Who's gonna think of suicide
looking at this corpse, huh?
No will and no wallet
Even if it was a suicide,
who'd want to stay here
after such a horrible death
I can't do it
You idiot!
Think I'm doing this
for myself?
Hurry up and bring the stuff!
- Be careful
- Then stop pushing, Uncle
Easy, easy
Hold on
I don't think it'll fit
We need to
dig a bigger hole
Hey, fold him in half
Young-min,
fold him from that side
I've got the upper body
You fold him from there
Are these the legs?
Okay, keep it still
Get out of the hole, idiot
Okay, that's good
Bury him
Mom!
We've got guests!
Do you need anything?
No, we've got
everything we need
And we won't need
a thing from now on
What a morbid joke from
such a nice young couple
Well, thank you
It's nice and quiet here
Just the place we wanted
Let's go in
Bye
Have a good night
Why is our fate so unlucky?
I'm sure the gods
will take pity on me
By the way, what's that
business about Young-min?
How should I know?
He's the one
who took him beer
So the police will question
the last person to see him
Then they'll know about
Young-min's convictions,
and about the missing wallet
The cops will be all over us,
so who'll run the lodge?
And by chance...
Well, we have no choice
Do the girls know?
Uncle,
he really did kill himself
I knew it the moment
I saw the poor bastard
But his wallet being missing
is really weird
Isn't it, Uncle?
Uncle
Uncle
What's that noise?
I'll be damned!
What did we do
to deserve this?
What are you all staring at?
Hurry up and get the bags!
He's alive!
Shut him up!
Get him!
Who wants dumplings?
What's wrong with everyone?
I'll have some
Hello?
Yes
Hold on
It's for you
Who is it?
I don't know, take it
Who is this?
Oh, it's you Mr. Park
Pardon?
What did you say?
The road work
will be ahead of schedule?
In two or three days?
They'll be digging
and everything?
No, I'm delighted
I'm so happy I'm delirious
Sure
Thank you
See you then
Bye
The road work
may start tomorrow
Then shouldn't we move
those things elsewhere?
What things?
You're all so weird today
After discovering
a stranded submarine,
Marines and US-Korean Forces
conducted a joint-investigation
and announced that North
Korean spies have infiltrated
South Korean territory
for espionage
Out of my way!
- He looks like a creep
- Who?
The one you
had your eyes on
Cut the crap
It's good to have you back
Hyun-suk,
you've been here before?
Didn't I tell you that I was
here with my colleagues?
How are you, Ma'am?
- Do you have a room?
- Of course
Young-min!
Take the guests upstairs
Okay
It smells like chlorine
- How much?
- 30,000 won
What?
It's too much
It's just for an hour or two
And I've been here before
It's still 30,000 won
- Take it
- Enjoy your...
Okay, okay
Just go
I think it's worth the price
You look hot in that muffler
I'm fine
Aren't you hot?
No
You must be
Hyun-suk,
what are you doing?
- Take it off
- You said we won't do this
- Take it off first and talk
- The buttons will snap
- This is no resting
- This is how I rest
Close the curtains
Right, the curtains
Closing the curtains
Now they're closed
I don't want to
Stop it
- Let's hit the road
- Just one more bottle
- It's going to be dark soon
- Wait a sec...
Hold on, hold on
Hold on!
Hello?
Yes, your phone
is out of order
Please leave
the receiver down
Put the receiver down?
Just for 10 minutes
and it'll be fixed
Okay, put the receiver...
What is it?
Receiver! Just down!
Out of order?
What are you doing?
Just called a friend
You had a friend?
Put the damn thing
down right
You're leaving?
Yes
Can we catch the bus
if we leave now?
You're not going hiking?
We talked and time flew by
Right, we talked
Maybe too much
We'll go hiking next time
And that's a promise
Yeah, next time
let's talk little and go hiking
You should hurry now
Be sure to stop by again
Sure
Oh yeah
This must be the
previous customer's wallet
It was stuck in the bed
But it had no money
So maybe you can return
it to the owner
What's wrong?
Did it have money?
- No
- Well, then
Honey!
Honey!
A man can't even
shit in peace in this house
What is it?
What's with the knock?
- Look here
- What is it?
Take a good look
at the picture
It's him
Where did you get it?
The young couple found this
stuck in the bed corner
This is not good
Aren't those two guys
from the lodge?
- Wait a minute!
- Just stay there!
- You're right
- They're coming this way
What for?
They're holding something
- Oh, no!
- What is it?
Hurry! We're in trouble!
Did we do something wrong?
Yes, so hurry up!
Because we lied about
not sleeping together?
Is that why?
You talk too much!
Why are they running?
Maybe they know something
Come on, how can they?
Maybe it's these things
in our hands
But they still
shouldn't run away
Something's fishy
Uncle, you follow them
and I'll take the short cut
This is really getting
out of control
What's he saying?
Why did you
run away like that?
Okay, we're sorry
Stop crying,
and tell us what happened
- What did he say?
- He's scared
Man, she's too noisy
Stop it!
Okay, okay, I'm sorry
What? What?
- What did she say?
- They only did it once
What does that mean?
Then why are you so scared?
Now what?
This prick
thinks we're muggers
I swear!
It's all that was in the wallet
What is it?
The young couple had it
I told you it was a suicide
Then we did all that
for nothing?
What do you want from me?
It's all spilled milk now!
Hiking is so refreshing!
Let's stop here
for some rest
Welcome back
Let's sit here
Would you like
something to drink?
Beer, please
- I know what you're up to
- Come on
I just want to make up
for old times
Is it Polo?
Or Safari maybe?
Strange
Why'd you make me
drink so much?
I bet you didn't drink at all
We're almost there
Just one more step
It's strange how I'm so drunk
and you're so sober
I still don't know
What love is
I want to know
Because I'm already 17
I don't know what love is
I'm already 17
Oh, it was you!
You sing so beautifully
- I thought you were asleep
- No, not yet
Isn't that song from the movie
"Home of the Stars?"
- Did you see it?
- No
How'd you know
such an old song?
Well, I like old songs
I see
Do you know the singer?
Not really
Her name is Yoon Si-nae
It can't be
Her voice is so different
Doesn't she have
a husky voice?
They say her voice used
to be really high-pitched
But it became husky
from too much practice
You seem to know a lot
But that's not the way
you sing the song
The lyrics were wrong, too
I see
Well, what are words anyway
It's how a person sings it
that really matters
Right
The night air is so fresh
- What's your name?
- Misoo
- Last name?
- Kang
What a pretty name!
Misoo, why don't we
take a little walk?
It would be nice to hear you
sing as we walk in the woods
Shall we?
Yes
But not too far
Why? Do I scare you?
No, I haven't eaten...
I mean, it's dinner time
and they'll be looking for me
I see
Well, shall we?
Sure
- Misoo isn't eating?
- I guess
Is she on that
good-for-nothing diet again?
Give me my food!
Here
My sister Mina is 17
Really?
I thought you were 17
when I heard you sing
You look much younger
than your sister
I do?
Then who are those men?
The mean-Iooking one
is my brother,
and the nice-Iooking man
is my uncle
Oh, I see
I bet your brother
is very protective
Not really
We don't tell
each other what to do
I see
- Do you have a boyfriend?
- Not too many
- Do you date a lot?
- Not too much
Well, kissing?
Not too...
Oh my!
What if you and I kissed?
Just for fun, huh?
Hey, is Misoo asleep?
I said is she asleep?
Don't yell when
you're that close
Hey, I didn't yell
from the start
What?
So is Misoo sleeping or not?
I saw her walk toward the
woods with that guy in 208
208? Why?
You could've told me sooner!
You just asked!
- I just asked?
- Yes!
Stop! Get away from me!
If you keep on pushing me,
I'll fall off the cliff
- Just once, okay?
- No
If you keep on disappointing me,
I can be really mean
Stay still
Okay, okay
Mom!
Stop it
Misoo!
Misoo!
Misoo!
Stop it
Young-min!
You asshole!
Bastard
Look at this bastard
So you wanna
fight like a man?
Come on, you little prick!
You asshole
Okay, okay, that's enough
Get off of me
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean anything
Sure, just get off of me
No more fighting, okay?
Okay, so get off
You promised, right?
Just get the fuck up, asshole!
Blood!
My neck
Don't touch it
Are you okay?
Damn it, it hurts
Okay, okay, I'm sorry
Sure you're okay, right?
Yes, just go
Okay, I'm sorry
Asshole...
What? What?
I'm still alive
Are you okay?
Who left the front...
What a good for nothing
Honey!
Hey, pull yourself together!
- Who is Misoo's brother?
- Why?
He said that Misoo's brother
pushed him off the cliff
Oh, I can't understand
a darn thing he said
Hey!
Going somewhere?
I don't think I'm needed here
Oh no, we're in big trouble
We'll just move them
This mountain is a treasure
But it was a military zone,
so we couldn't develop it
Now the new government
has lifted all the regulations
And who will soon own all this?
Me, to be exact
But there's one problem
and it's my half-sister
Her name's Eun-joo
My old man is very fond of her
He'll get her the moon
if she asked
She's gonna take everything
from me, the legitimate son
Does this sound fair to you?
I've realized that many things
in life aren't exactly fair
So then?
So I've decided to invite
my father to this lodge
for rest and for
some business
No one is to know that he's
coming here with her, okay?
Not even you
Me neither?
You don't get it, do you?
I'll take care of that bitch,
and you just pretend
to know nothing
I don't know anything, right?
Keep this a secret
I'll be in touch
When I call,
get your best room ready
I'm counting on you
Shit!
Just give it to me
That's no way to dig
Like this, okay?
Like this
You must all be exhausted
Everyone sit
Just a little for me
I'm dead tired
Wow, are we having
chicken noodles?
Son, sit down
Digging is becoming
a job now
Now everyone's a pro
It took us several hours
to bury the first one
Even more
But today, Young-min only
took 30 minutes to dig a hole
It was like a custom-tailored
hole for the body
Man, you sure
knew how to dig!
Did I tell you about Chul-ki?
The guy I met in the army?
He was so good at digging
that if you gave him a shovel
he'd automatically dig his way
Whenever I see a shovel,
it reminds me of Chul-ki
I wonder what
he's doing now?
He must be
somewhere digging
Dad, anything else to bury?
Like a kimchi pot?
I might as well do it now
Hey, turn on the news
What happened
to those spies?
Are they caught?
Seven North Korean spies
were shot to death today
The first gunshot
was heard at 10: 15 near...
Oh my,
that's not far from here
What if they show up here?
Those bastards
should be buried alive
Right?
Careful, careful
Sir, welcome
to our humble lodge
This unpaved road
made him even more tired
If it weren't for you,
he wouldn't be tired
Honey, help him in
This way, sir
It's quite chilly outside
Wow, she's hot
I'd say quite intellectual
I can't believe they both
come from the same seed
Because it was different soil!
Please come inside
It's more chilly here
in the mountains
This way, please
Watch the steps
Up this way, sir
Please be careful
A man is going to be here
exactly at midnight
Give him the room
next to my sister's
He'll take care of everything
Take care of what?
He'll do everything,
so you don't need to know
Don't worry
But what's there to know?
I trust you Mr. Park
Don't forget it's midnight
Yes, all I know is midnight
Going somewhere, Miss?
Yes, I want to take a look
at our family mountain
Mina will show me around
Then you'll be
back by twelve?
By twelve?
Sure, a couple of hours
is more than enough
Mina, let's go
- Twelve o'clock
- Yes, midnight
Hey
Where do you think
you're going?
- Hiking
- What for?
I live in a mountain lodge
Do I need
a reason for hiking?
What a moron!
Miss Eun-joo,
care for some candy?
No thanks
I should go back
So soon?
My father's waiting
May I help you?
There must be a dining
facility in the storage
Oh, I'm the Chief of the
police station in town
Is that so?
But...
Well, we've got some
missing person reports
Maybe you could help us
By any chance,
did you see people come...
What is the storage for?
We keep things there,
it's quite messy
All storages are messy
Well, did you see two men
One is from Seoul and
the other is a local resident
He's medium-height
with a jumper on
I don't think so
There aren't
that many hikers here
Are there guests
in the lodge now?
No hikers,
but we have two...
No, one house guest
I see
If you see two men
who fit the description,
don't hesitate to call us
Of course
Walking all the way up here
sure made me thirsty
Do you mind
getting me some water?
Sure, you stay here,
and I'll bring it right away
What a nice view!
I never went hiking
while living here
Oh, thank you
What?
The police chief?
Now what?
What else?
We move the guy
to a room upstairs
- And the bodies?
- Them, too
Move all of them again?
How many are there?
I'll meet you later, bye!
Bye, sweety!
Sir
- Where the hell were you?
- I went home for a second
Think you can do
whatever you like on duty?
Then why didn't
you answer at home?
Get me the
orchard on the phone
You got an
assignment tonight
After going on a hike,
Mr. Jang of the pear orchard
has been missing for days
I went up to the lodge today
and they acted strange
So spend the night there
and check things out
- But today...
- Your call, sir
What does he do?
Who?
The one that Mr. Park said
was coming at midnight
How should I know?
A hired killer, maybe
How greedy can a man be
to kill his own sister?
He probably wants to scare
her or lock her up someplace
He told me that she
was a lavish spender,
and that she hasn't married
and gets around
She is sexy though
Sexy or not, we give him the
next room when he comes
That's all we need to do
and he'll handle everything
Shouldn't we tell him
the room number?
No, that means we know
Mr. Park knew
what he was doing
when he asked
for the next room
What if he goes
into a wrong room?
It worries me
It sure won't be our room
Mina
Mina
Wake up
Can't you see
I'm watching TV?
- Go to sleep
- The anthem wasn't even on
Good-night, Dad
What is it?
Nothing...
You weren't asleep?
I'm going to bed now
- What are you doing?
- Huh?
Go on
Go to bed
How much?
You must be tired
How much?
It's okay
Just go upstairs
Please, it's not necessary
So you know
That's strange
Would you like
some cold beer?
No, I'm sort of on duty,
so I don't drink
A real professional
- Pardon?
- A pro
You talked as if you knew
Who's the one
who offered beer?
Shut up
Tell Young-min
to watch the counter
Go on
- It's 30,000 won
- What?
I said it's 30,000 won
Didn't you get the message?
What message?
Just give me the 30,000 won
I was to be here by midnight,
but I got lost
It's still gonna
cost you 30,000 won
- You sure it's the right room?
- Yes
Of course I'm sure, asshole
Who does he think he is
to be rude to me like that?
Don't fuck with me, asshole
Did anyone come?
Yeah, a man
- What did he look like?
- Real dirty
Your folks have gone way
out of line this time
Did you see my lighter,
the one with the dragon?
Everytime something's
missing, you ask me
Miss Eunjoo,
this is Chang-ku
Don't speak and just listen
What do you think you're doing?
You scared me, you shithead!
You could've paid me
some respect earlier
Bastard's dead
Hey, you
Hey, you
Get the boys
Hurry!
Young-min!
You stay in your room
- Mom!
- Hurry!
What on earth happened here?
Where were you?
What about the old man
and his daughter?
Answer me, damn it!
I sent them to Seoul
Bastard!
You're dead meat!
Let's talk about it!
Know what you just did?
Why'd you kill that guy?
Dad, what's going on?
Let go!
Young-min!
Wake up!
Look at this blood!
He's this way
Here
- The name?
- Tae-gu Kang
Tae-gu! Tae-gu!
That's my name
Who asked for your name?
I'm Soon-nae Jung
Is this a joke or what?
The patient's name!
- Young-min Kang
- Young-min
Young-min! Young-min!
Can you hear me?
- Who's coming with us?
- I will
- Me, too
- Me, also
Only one can get a ride
We'll take our van
Fine, let's go
You and I have work to do
- What is this?
- Yes?
It's not him
No
If this isn't him,
then who is he?
What's going on here?
I want the truth!
Do you want to burn
down the entire lodge?
Mom!
Mom!
Mina, what's wrong?
Uncle, push this up
Is it a blackout?
Another North Korean spy was
found dead in a mountain region
He was dressed in civilian clothes
wearing a t-shirt and jump suit
The police speculated that he
may have tried to contact...
That's that rude bastard!
Why is he there?
They say he seems
to have fallen
What's up?
Didn't you hear that?
There you go again
No, it's true!
Okay, just sit
Uncle
Uncle
Let's eat
