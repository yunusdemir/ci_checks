[Indian music playing]
RANJAN: Hooray. Mowgli!
SHANTl: Shh Ranjan. hush
It's starting
FATHER: Come. Children
Come watch
Mowgli. Tell us your story
[Music playing]
MOWGLI: I never knew
where I came from
but I always knew
where I belonged
Subtitles downloaded from Podnapisi.NET
This is me and Bagheera
the panther who found me
in the jungle
He's a good friend of mine
But my best friend of all
was good old Papa Bear
Man. We had
some crazy times together
And when the monkeys
grabbed me
things got really crazy
RANJAN: Monkey!
[Animals screeching]
RANJAN: Go. Papa Bear!
MOWGLI:
Then I came face to face
with the meanest
Scariest tiger
in the whole jungle
Shere Khan
[Ranjan roaring]
You stay away from Mowgli,
you mean old tiger...
or I'll tie some fire
to your tail and burn your butt!
Yaah!
[Rips]
- Ranjan!
- Whoa! Uhh!
[Muffled roaring]
[Laughing]
MO THER. LAUGHING:
Oh. Ranjan
[Roars]
I got him, Mowgli!
Did you see? I got him.
You sure did, Ranjan...
but it's gonna be kind of hard
to finish the story now.
But we all know how it ends.
Shanti blinks her big beautiful
brown eyes at you...
and you followed her
into our village.
I did not.
Did so.
Something was in my eye.
Both of them?
Well, you were so ugly
you made my eyes water.
- Well, you...
- Ha ha! Now, now.
We give thanks for Shanti's
beautiful brown eyes.
Without them...
Mowgli would never have
found his way into our lives.
Come to think of it,
you used the same trick on me.
And you still fall for it.
[Laughing]
Thank you
for a wonderful story, Mowgli.
Good night, Mowgli.
Night, Shanti.
Watch out for Shere Khan
on your way home.
You and your stories.
Everyone knows tigers
don't come into the village.
[Ranjan roars]
Tigers go wherever they want!
- Aah!
- Ooh.
[Chuckles]
Good night, boys.
[Boys laughing]
Tomorrow's gonna be so great.
MOTHER:
What happens tomorrow?
Um...
- Nothing.
- Nothing.
Aha.
Well, then, you will need
plenty of rest...
for doing nothing tomorrow.
Off to bed
[Yawns] Ah, we never get
to stay up late.
Ha ha! Even wild beasts
need their sleep.
[Roars]
Oh, help! Ferocious tiger!
[Parents laughing]
Ah, good night,
my little wild thing.
[Kisses]
Good night, Mowgli.
Happy dreams.
Um, good night...
sir.
Why do you always
call him "Sir"?
His name's "Pa "
[Snoring]
[Roaring]
Unh!
[Snoring continues]
Hmm.
[Snoring]
Ha ha!
[Stretching]
[Roars]
Aah! Whoa!
Come on, Mowgli!
Wake up, it's morning!
You said we would go to...
Ranjan! Ranjan!
Do you wanna wake up
the whole village?
When does the tiger roar?
[Muffled] I don't know.
After he catches his prey.
His prey.
Let's go get our prey.
[Mother humming]
Boys.
- Huh?
- Where are you going so early?
- To... do our chores?
- Yeah!
Not without breakfast,
you aren't.
[Both gasp]
[Shanti humming]
- That's OK. We're not hungry.
- Gotta go!
Ooh!
Boys, where are you going?
- To do our chores!
- Bye, Papa! See you later!
Remember!
Don't cross the river!
[Sighs]
You can take the boy
out of the jungle...
But you can't take the jungle
out of the boy.
Yes.
That's what worries me.
[Gasps]
[Water flowing]
- Hey, Shanti.
- Aah!
What are you doing here?
Getting water.
What are you doing here?
Oh, uh, I'm on the lookout
for danger.
Danger? Please.
There's no danger around here.
Uh...
[Whispering] Well, uh,
keep this just between us?
Yesterday, I saw tiger tracks.
Tiger tracks? Right.
It's Shere Khan.
I hear he's looking for me...
seeking
his bloodthirsty revenge.
So keep your ears open
and always watch your back...
or the last thing
you'll ever hear is...
[Roars]
Aah! Uhh! Uhh!
[Laughing]
When does the tiger roar?
[Both roaring]
Oh! You're horrible!
Horrible, stinky boys!
Come on, Ranjan.
He's a bad influence.
[Children talking
and laughing]
Now, don't move.
That wasn't very nice,
you know.
[Roars]
Stop that.
You're not a jungle boy.
Why are you so a-scared
of the jungle?
Because it's dangerous.
Dangerous? But Mowgli says...
You shouldn't listen
to everything Mowgli says.
But I thought you liked Mowgli.
Well, I do.
I like Mowgli.
But I... oh... ooh.
Uh, you left this at the river.
[Sighs]
Thank you.
She's in a bad mood.
Hey, Ranjan, you want to see
a little trick I learned...
in the jungle?
[Wham]
[Zing]
Mmm. That's
a pretty good trick.
Well, here's a little trick
I learned right here at home.
[Twirling]
RANJAN: Wow!
That's a neater trick.
Like I said, Ranjan,
don't listen to him.
She's right, Ranjan,
don't listen to me.
[Drums beating]
Listen to the jungle.
Can you hear it?
Yeah.
The jungle.
[Music growing louder]
Yeah, man!
And when you hear that rhythm,
you get a crazy feeling inside.
** That morning sun
peeks over the mountains **
** And all the ninos
rub their eyes **
** When they hear **
Hear what?
** Hear the jungle rhythm **
** Those birds are **
** Tap-tap-tapping
the tree trunks **
** The busy bee hums
as he flies **
** Loud and clear **
** To the jungle rhythm *
** Now. You can hightail it
out of the jungle **
** But it never leaves
your heart **
** First you feel that beat
start bubbling under **
** Then you hear the tom toms
loud as thunder **
It's moving me!
** Sounds a lot
like being free **
** When you feel **
** Feel the jungle rhythm **
[Children laughing]
BO Y: Yeah. Guys
** Feel the jungle rhythm **
Come on, Shanti!
** Can't do without rhythm **
** And when it fills the air **
Animals everywhere
join in the dance **
[Laughs] Hey, give me that!
** You'll dance along
with 'em **
** Feelin' it steal your soul **
** We'll stomp our paws.
Flap our wings **
** Maybe do
one or two crazy things **
[Children cheering]
- Caw! Caw!
- Yeah, that's it!
Ooh-ooh-ah-ah, ooh-ooh-ah-ah!
A-whoo!
[Trumpets]
- Eep! Eep! Eep!
- Caw! Caw!
- Eep! Eep! Eep!
- Chika chika boom!
- Eep! Eep! Eep!
- A-whoo!
[rhythmic animal chants]
[BIowing]
Shanti! Try this.
Not quite.
There we go. Oh... no.
Take a look. Perfect.
** Boom-a-chaka.
Boom-a-chaka **
** Boom-a-chaka.
Boom-a-chaka. Boom **
** Check out those
chat-chat-chattering monkeys **
** Swinging through
the banyan trees **
** Two by two. Two by two **
** To the jungle rhythm **
** Sounds like a wolf pack
way in the distance **
** Singing pretty harmonies **
** Woo woo woo. Woo woo woo **
** To the jungle rhythm **
- Yeah! Whoo-hoo!
- Yeah, that's it!
<i>** Now. You can hightail it
out of the jungle> **</i>
** But it never
leaves your heart **
** First you feel that beat
start bubbling under **
** Then you hear the tom toms
loud as thunder **
It's moving me!
** Sounds a lot
like being free **
** When I feel. When I feel **
** When I feel. When I feel **
** Feel the jungle rhythm **
** Boom shaka-laka
boom sh-bop sh-bop **
** Boom shaka-laka
boom sh-bop sh-bop **
Whoa, wait, wait, stop!
You're crossing the river!
Mowgli,
you can't go in the jungle!
It's too dangerous! Mowgli!
Stop!
[Music stops]
Shanti, what is it?
Children, come inside
this instant, all of you!
Mowgli!
That includes you!
I am very disappointed in you.
You put everyone in danger.
You know that you're not allowed
to cross the river...
and yet you deliberately
disobeyed me.
- But, but I...
- No, Mowgli.
The jungle
is a dangerous place.
I should know.
[Gasps]
[Sighs]
You are confined to your room
without dinner.
That should give you
plenty of time...
to think about what you've done.
M-Mowgli,
I... I was only trying to h...
[Dramatic music playing]
[Chattering]
** Oh. You can hightail it
out of the jungle **
** But it never leaves
your heart **
Oh, Baloo.
[Music playing]
** Look for
the bare necessities **
** The simple
bare necessities **
** Forget about your worries
and your strife **
** Yeah. I mean
the bum-bada-dada-dee-dada **
** The rum-pum-pa-ta
ree-ta-ta **
** That bring
the bare necessities of life **
Now, that's more like it!
Ha ha! Look at you!
Aw, growing like
the proverbial weed.
Let's see if you still got it.
** Ra-pa-dada-dada
debba-ra-da **
Take it away, Little Britches.
Poor fellow.
I said, take it away!
[SIow music playing]
Ohh.
This ain't gonna work.
You just ain't Mowgli.
Ah, I guess I gotta get used
to singing solo.
He's just not
getting over that...
[Gasps]
Oh, no, not again!
Baloo!
Baloo!
[Footsteps]
[Growling]
[Crunch]
Uhh. Mowgli...
[Growls]
Huh? Hmm...
[Music playing]
[Twitters]
Unh.
[Twitters]
Get out of here! Shoo! Shoo!
[Twittering]
Now... now, don't worry.
I'll take care of it.
Baloo?
Baloo?
Oh, man.
[Chuckles] Bagheera.
How's it wagging?
This has to stop.
You can't keep trying to take
Mowgli from the man-village.
The boy's future lies
with his own kind
[Splash]
BALOO:
Aw. his future can wait
I miss my bear cub
[Sighs] It's not safe for him
in the jungle.
You know Shere Khan
is looking for Mowgli.
Just let Shere Khan
try something.
We handled old Stripes once.
We'll do it again.
- Baloo, don't push your luck.
- Out of the way, Baghee.
You're not going near
the village!
[Straining] Oh!
[Mutters, coughs]
Later, Baghee.
That's it!
Hathi! Plan "B"!
[Elephant trumpets]
[Crunch]
ELEPHANTS:
Hup, two, three, four!
Keep it up, two, three, four!
Now, remember, men...
our objective is full
and complete containment.
Prepare for Operation...
uh, Oper...
Um, Stop That Bear?
Very good, son! Yes.
Prepare for Operation...
Stop That Bear!
[Gulp]
** By the ranks
or single file **
** Over every jungle mile **
Run, Baghee!
You're in the parade ground!
[Gasps]
Oh! No, please, stop!
HATHl: Company... halt!
[Screech]
Hmm?
I told you, Baloo...
there's no way we're letting you
near the man-village.
You ain't gonna stop me now,
Baghee.
Look out below!
Search the water!
- Follow me.
- This way.
[Music playing]
ELEPHANT: Over here. Sir
[Gasps]
[Gasps] Baloo!
[Muttering]
Check over there!
[Inhales]
[Bubbling]
[Elephants shouts]
I've got him, Colonel!
Confound it, soldier!
- That's a fish!
- Oopsy.
Disgrace to the uniform.
[Heavy footsteps]
[Gasps] Colonel!
Th-this log can't possibly
support your weight!
Balderdash!
Why, my dear boy,
back in '88...
in service to the crown,
I found myself straddling a...
Oh, no, not again.
- Aah!
- Whoa!
[Roars]
[Bubbling]
[Gasping]
Well, they don't make trees
like they used to.
[Squeak]
Got him!
Got him right here.
[Coughing]
Ah! Disguised
as a panther, Baloo.
It's me, Hathi!
Put me down!
- Sorry. Heh.
- Whoa!
HATHl: Keep searching. Men
Couldn't have gone far!
[Spits]
ELEPHANT: Who are we
looking for. Anyway?
- Oh, confound it, man!
- Heh heh heh.
Ooh!
Ha ha!
Don't turn me in, little guy.
I just want to see my bear cub.
I won't. I miss Mowgli, too.
This way, quick!
Hey, thanks, kid.
You're all right.
[Dramatic music playing]
[Growls]
Say, fellas, look who's coming.
That's Shere Khan.
- What we gonna do?
- Don't start that again.
Lucky. Hey, Lucky.
Yeah?
That's the one
we told you about, Shere Khan.
Mmm. Shere Khan. You don't say.
Hey, watch this, watch this.
I got one for you.
Check this out.
Hey, hey!
Look at me! Look at me!
- Hey!
- Whoa!
I'm Shere Khan...
and me tiger tush
has been torched.
[Vultures laughing]
Ask me if I could whup
that tiger.
Go on, go on, ask me.
Can you whup that tiger?
I Shere Khan.
[Vultures laughing]
Did you get it? Did you get it?
Save me! Save me!
I've been outwitted by 40 pounds
of scrawny man-cub.
[Vultures laughing,
Khan growling]
LUCKY:
I'm cracking myself up here
I don't know how I do it

Mind if I drop in?
Baloo?
[Louder] Oh, Bal...
Shh.
[Muffled talking]
- Ah.
- Papa Bear!
Boy, am I glad to see you!
What are you doing here?
What am I doing here?
Feeling right for the first time
in a while, that's what.
Ha ha ha!
Hey, kid, show me you can
still fight like a bear.
- Come on.
- Aah!
Oh, Little Britches,
you lost your touch.
Mowgli.
I've got something for you.
SHANTl: Mowgli. It's me
Don't be mad
I get grounded all the time.
Ah. Heh heh heh heh.
Mowgli,
I'm sorry you got in trouble.
Come on, man-cub...
show yourself.
[Sighs]
BALOO: Come on! Come on!
- Whoa!
- Mowgli?
[Mowgli grunting]
MOWGLI: Wait. no! No!
[Baloo laughs]
MOWGLI: Oh!
Come on, stick and move.
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
Aah!
Help! Wild animal!
Wild animal? Where?
Come on, let's get outta here!
Help!
MAN: What? What is it?
What's that bear doing here?
There's a wild animal
in the village!
FATHER:
What is the matter?
There he is!
W-where are you going?
No, come back! Come back!
You're going the wrong way!
Wow, a tiger!
Rraaar!
MAN:
Don't let him get away!
[Roaring]
[Gasps]
[Men shouting]
No! Uh, please...
We gotta get out of here.
- Shanti, get indoors!
- No, no, no, he's over...
No! Uhh!
Shanti!
Shanti, wait for me!
[Roaring]
[Men grunting]
Come on, come on!
Follow me! Follow me!
[Panting]
- Waah!

[Gasps]
Hold on, Mowgli!
Uhh!
Aah!
MO THER: Shanti?
Shanti?
Hmm.
[Grunting]
Uhh.
Mowgli?
MO THER: Shanti!
FATHER: Where are you?
- Mowgli!
- They must be in the jungle.
Ah. Heh heh heh heh.
The jungle.
What a weird scene.
Is that place always like that?
You don't know the half of it.
That village was terrible.
All you ever hear is,
rules, rules, rules...
and work, work, work.
Whoa, kid. Watch your language.
That's all they do!
Washing, dressing...
Oh, man,
I'm tired just listening to it.
Sounds like they're
kinda screwy over there.
I don't want to talk about it.
Especially Shanti.
Who's Shanti?
Ah, she's just a girl
from the village.
Now hold on.
Not the one that lured you into
that village in the first place.
Yep, that's the one.
I knew it, I knew it.
I knew she was trouble.
I even tried bringing her
to the jungle...
and she got me in trouble.
Say again?
I just wanted her to see
how much fun we have.
And she got you
into trouble for that?
- Yep.
- Ooh, man.
She thinks the jungle
is a scary place.
Where'd she get
that crazy idea?
You got me.
Mmm.
Do my snake eyes deceive me?
Ooh. It's
the s-s-succulent man-cub. Mmm.
BALOO:
Well. You're with me now. Kid
Forget that girl.
You're better off without her.
You got everything you need
right here.
And me, I've got
my old singin' partner back.
Then hit it, Papa Bear.
** Look for
the bare necessities **
** The simple
bare necessities **
** Forget about your worries
and your strife **
** I mean
the bare necessities **
** Old Mother Nature's recipes **
** That bring
the bare necessities of life **
** Wherever I wander **
BALOO:
Where you goin'?
** Wherever I roam **
BALOO: Oh. Yeah
** I couldn't be fonder
of my big home **
** The bees are buzzing
in the tree **
** To make some honey
just for me **
** When you look under
the rocks and plants **
** Take a glance
at the fancy ants **
** And maybe try a few **
** Thanks. Baloo **
[Inhales]
** The bare necessities of life
will come to you **
** They'll come to you **
Oh, Baloo.
I don't ever want to see
that girl or that village again.
Well, of course you don't.
It's just us bears
from here on in.
Yeah, man.
Hey, you remember
everything I learned ya?
You bet I do, Papa Bear.
- Nuh-uh-uh.
- Huh?
** Now. When you pick
a pawpaw **
** Or a prickly pear **
** And you pick a raw paw **
** Well. next time beware **
** Don't pick the prickly pear
by the paw **
** When you pick a pear.
Try to use the claw **
** But you don't need
to use the claw **
** When you pick a pair
of the big pawpaw **
** Have I given you a clue? **
[Slide whistle]
** The bare necessities of life
will come to you **
** They'll come to you **
MOWGLI:
They'll come to me?
I so despise
these song-and-dance routines.
Uhh!
Mowgli!
Mowgli?
Is that you?
Mowgli?
[Hooting]
He's gotta be here somewhere.
[Fabric tears]
Uhh.
Uhh.
[Squawks]
Ohh! Aah! Aah!

Excuse me.
Might I be of some assistance?
Hmm? Heh heh heh
Are you lost, little one?
Heh heh. Are you hungry?
I'm starved.
Hoo hoo hoo hoo

You leave Shanti alone!

OK, Ranjan.
I... I think he's had enough.
Ohh.

[Boinging]
[Gasps]
Oh!
Ooh!
[Coconuts thud]
You're not getting away
that easy!
Oh, Ranjan, what are you doing?
You're not supposed to be here.
We have to get you home
right now.
No! Mowgli's in trouble,
and we're going to find him!
[Sniffs]
I can smell him.
[Sniffs]
He's this way!
Oh, OK...
but stay close.
We don't want to run into
any more scary animals.
- Rarr!
- Oh, stop that.
[Coconuts thudding]
[Muffled moaning]
Oh, mercy. Ooh!

[Shere Khan chuckles]
S-Shere Khan?

Anyone I know?
I wish.
Aw, stupid man-cub.
[Gulp]
- Man-cub?
- Uh, did... did I s-say man-cub?
Well, well, I... I... you know...
I'd love to stay and shoot
the breeze and all, but...
[Splat]
What's your hurry?
[Gulp]
Uh, no reason. I... I... I...
Oh!
Where is he?
Who he?
The man-cub Mowgli.
I know you know.
Well, b-but I... I don't.
Oh, please don't insult
my intelligence.
It makes me irritable.
Oh, he's not in the village.
[Squeak]
I know where he isn't.
Now tell me where he is.
Well, he's, um, he's... he's...
The swamp!
Uh, he's at the s-swamp, yes.
Hmm. The swamp, eh?
Yes. Trust in me.
[Thud]
Hmm.
He'd better be... for your sake.
[Honk]
He is, he is!
[Wheezes] I'd...I'd take you
there myself
but I'm afraid
I'd slow you down...
indigestion and all.
[Birds chirping]
FATHER: Mowgli!
MO THER: Ranjan!

[Birds chirping]
Huh? What?
Huh? Ohh!
Uhh! Oh, dear. Huh?

Man is in the jungle!
Wh-what does he want?
MAN:
Think they'll come out?
SECOND MAN:
I think they're over here!
Mowgli!
Ohh. Penaps I was too harsh
with the boy.
Don't worry. We'll find them.
MAN:
Children. Can you hear me?

Baloo.
Uhh! Almost got it, Baloo.

Whoa!
Ah, them primo mangos...

[Laughs] Hey, not bad.
Where'd you learn to do that?
Shanti showed me.
Shanti?
[Splat]
I... no, I... I said wanti.
I wanti another mango.
Ha ha ha.
No, no, no,
that's not what you said.
You said Shanti.
No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.
- Did.
- Didn't.
- Did. Uh-huh.
- Didn't. Uh-uh.
- Yep. I heard it.
- Uh-uh.
You know what?
Who cares about Shanti?
Because it's just
a stupid trick, right?
[Laughs] Yeah, right.
You don't need her, kid.
You're with old Baloo now.
[Fweeooh]
[Thudding]
[Squish]
[Splat]
[Laughs]
What are you laughing at?
[Gasps]
What are you doin' out here,
Baghee?
Haven't you heard?
Man is in the jungle.
Wha-wha-what do they want?
They're searching for Mowgli.
BALOO: Mowgli?
I thought that penaps
maybe you have seen the boy.
Me? Uh, no. Ha.
You know his future
is in that village.
Yes.
I just wish I knew
where he was.
Yeah. Whew. Sorry.
Heh. Man, wish I could
help you out, Baghee.
Ohh! Enough games, Baloo!
Now give me the boy!
Baghee, Baghee, Baghee, Baghee.
I can explain.
I can explain. I...
can explain,
but I don't have to...
'cause you can plainly see
Mowgli is not here.
I'm all alone
[Ding]
[Sighs] I know
he's around here somewhere...
and he can't hide forever.
Well, he won't get past you,
Baghee.
Hmm.
[Groans]
Whew! Kid?
Kid, where'd you go?
- Aah!
- Aah!
Uhh!
Ohh! What are you
tryin' to do...
scare the tick
out of my ticker?
- Ha ha ha!
- Ohh!
Wow, the whole village...
Iooking for me?
We can't let nobody see you.
I thought they were mad.
We gotta lay low, hunker down...
<i>hibernate. Like</i>
They must really miss me.
I wonder...
if Shanti's with them.
Shanti?
You definitely
don't want her to find you.
Do ya?
No. We can't let anyone find us,
especially that girl.
Come on, Baloo.
We gotta get moving.
Lay low, hunker down...
hibernate, like.
Now, Mowgli...
what if that gir-r-rl
tracks us down?
- What are you gonna do?
- Then...
then you're gonna have
to scare her!
[Muffled] Scare her?
Has the milk run out
of your coconut?
No, she's terrified
of wild animals.
In case you haven't noticed,
kid, I'm no wild animal.
Heh... except at parties.
Heh heh heh.
I suppose I'm more
of a... honey bear.
You can do it, Baloo.
You're the one that taught me,
remember?
You scrunch up
your eyes like this...
and show your teeth
like this...
and roar like this...
roaarrrr!
Roar?
No, no, no, no.
Like you mean it.
Do you want that girl
to take me back to the village?
Rrraaaaaarrr!
[Coughs]
Yeah, man! That was great.
Well, I don't know.
Trust me. That'll do it.
Well, in that case, Mowgli,
consider that girl scarified.
Thanks, Papa Bear.
Anything for my Little Britches.
OK, let's skedaddle.
Now, don't you worry.
I got a place downriver.
It's the perfect hideout.
Real quiet, huh?
Quiet? Heh. You want quiet,
go back to that man-village.
This place is happenin'.
SHANTl:
OK, here's the village.
We crossed the river...
[Yelling]
Ranjan, be careful.
Ha ha!
OK, we went right.
No, no, no, no.
Um, left, left, I mean.
Right.
No, left, then right, and...
Ohh!
This jungle all looks the same!
Ha ha ha ha! Ah ha!
Ranjan, what's that?
Mowgli? He must've been here.
Or some animal
with really sharp claws.
[Dramatic music playing]
[Crickets chirping]
That snake lied to me.
Now, don't take it out
on the water...
just because you don't like
the reflection.
Ha ha! I mean
not everyone can be born
with such great looks.
You let that tiger
get his claws on you...
and you won't be
so good-Iooking.
What, that pussycat?
He's harmless. Watch this.
Oh.
What's the matter, Stripes?
Man-cub got your tongue?
Heh heh
VULTURE: Uh. Lucky
Let's find something to do
somewhere else.
No, no, no, no.
Hang on, fellas.
I got another one.
How many men does it take
to whup a tiger?
Heh heh heh. Surprise me.
None. A little kid
could do it all by himself.
Ah ha ha ha ha!
[Growls]
- Come on, Lucky, let's go.
- Come on, Lucky, let's go.
In fact, we heard that kid
is right here in the jungle.
[AII gasp]
Right under your whiskers.
- Ah ha ha!
- Interesting.
I heard he's headed
back to the village.
Ehh! Wrong again, kitty.
No, Lucky, keep your gob shut.
No, they say he's headed
downriver... with a bear.
Downriver, you say? Ah.
Oh, don't listen to him.
Ooh, yeah, he's new around here.
He don't know anything.
On the contrary,
he seems to know quite a lot.
Hey, hold on, hot pants!
Where's the fire?
Ah ha ha ha ha!
[Gulp]
Isn't it ironic that your name
is Lucky?
[Roaring]
[Screaming]
Come on, lads! This way!
Let's get out!
MOWGLI:
This is the perfect hideout?
This is King Louie's place
"Was," kid, "was."
He's splitsville.
Now me and the monkeys
have turned it...
into the greatest
secret hideout ever.
Excuse me. Comin' through.
Hey, Baloo!
Oh, good to see you
back again, man.
Heh. Everybody knows about it.
But if everybody knows about it,
how can it be a secret?
I mean,
everybody who's anybody.
Nobody who's nobody don't know
nothin' about no place...
that everybody who's anybody
knows about, you dig?
Uhh, my head hurts.
Hey, turn the thinker off
for a minute and just dive in.
Step aside, and I'll show you
what a real rug-cutter can do.
Ladies and gentlemen...
ple-e-e-ease welcome...
the boss of bop,
the jack of jive...
the jungle cat who's really
gonna keep it alive.
Get ready to stir it up
and serve it up.
I'm talkin' about...
Baloo is in the house!
Hey, cats, all right!
[Up-beat music playing]
** When we start to move.
hey. honey. It ain't no joke **
[Laughs]
** We got a savage groove **
** We didn't learn
from human folk **
** No human folk **
** 'Scuse our incivility **
** We're W-I-I-I-L-D **
** When the music plays. All
the people stomp their feel **
Go, Baloo.
** But a stompin' paw
can lay down a better beat **
** Tell me we ain't naturally **
** W-I-I-I-L-D **
** It's a snap to bring out
the beast in you **
** You're free like ze bird.
It's true **
** Or a frog or a hog **
** Baby. We were born free **
** From the baddest cat
to the sweetest little deer **
[Giggles]
** Tonight's the night we're
gonna get our tails in gear **
** Show me your ferocity **
** Go W-I-I-I-L-D **
** We snort. We squeak **
** Up high
or deep underground **
** We snarl. We shriek **
** We fly>
round and round and round **
[Scat singing]
Oh, you sweet thing,
that's inhuman, baby!
** The old mongoose
gets good and loose **
** The ocelot
gives it all he's got **
** The parakeet
goes tweedle-deet **
** The red macaque
shouts. "Hang on. Jack" **
** The tiny worm
The pachyderm **
** The spotted cat.
The water rat **
** The great cuckoo.
The bear Baloo **
** Are W-I-L-D **
** Here's the thing **
** If we're broke.
We never squawk **
** We don't need
to check no clock **
** To know what time it is **
** It's time to rock **
** When you dance like that.
hey. honey. It sure is hip **
I can't stand it!
** I want to tip my hat.
But I got no hat to tip **
** I don't need no hat **
** Ask me why.
And I won't lie **
** I'm W-I-I-I-L-D **
** We grunt. We growl **
** Up high
or deep underground **
** We hoot. We howl **
** We fly
round and round and round **
** My. Oh. Me.
It's plain to see **
** We're W-I-I-I-L-D **
** He. She. Me.
You-nique-ally **
** W-I-I-I-L-D **
** Every beastie
running free **
** W-I-I-I-I-I-I-L-D **
Huh? Oof! Aah! Whoa!
- Uhh!
- Ha ha ha ha ha!
[Music stops]
[Both laugh]
Whoo-hoo! That's my boy.
They don't swing out
like that...
in your man-village,
now do they, kid, hmm?
Well, uh, no.
Heh heh heh Big fat no
Say, what that village
like, anyway?
Hey, whoa, don't bother the kid.
He told me all about that scene.
Let me lay it out for you.
Those people are crazy.
Everybody works,
and nobody plays.
Oh, man!
BALOO: They got nothin'
but rules. Rules. Rules
Oh, and there's even
this girl...
who thinks the jungle
is a scary place Ha ha ha!
[Animals laughing]
But. You know.
It doesn't matter
'cause Mowgli's
never gonna see that village
or that crazy girl again
Ha ha ha!
Ain't that so, kid? Ha ha ha.
Mowgli? Mowgli?
Mowgli?
[Dramatic music playing]
BALOO: Mowgli!
** That morning sun
peeks over the mountains **
** And all the ninos
rub their eyes **
** When they hear **
** Hear the jungle rhythm **
[Ranjan yawns]
Did we find Mowgli yet?
Oh, are you tired?
A little.
I'm sure we'll find him soon.
Come on, hop up.
- You OK up there?
- Uh-huh.
** How could it be **
** Half as good
as being free? **
** Part of me **
** Like the jungle rhythm **
** Like the jungle rhythm **
[Gasps]
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?
It sounded like Mowgli.
- Mowgli!
- Ranjan, wait!
- Ranjan!
- Ha ha ha!
- Mowgli!
- Shanti?
- Whoa! Uhh!
- Are you OK?
Oh, I feel... vine. Heh heh.
RANJAN:
What are you doing up there?
Hold on, I'll be right...
Whoa!
I can't believe
I finally found you!
I thought
I would never see you again!
You out here, kid?
Hey, Little Britches?
[Echoes] Mowgli!
MOWGLI: Ow! Ow!
Hmm.
Ow, you're not really helping.
- Ranjan, stop pulling.
- It's her.
MOWGLI: So. What are you
doing out here. Anyway?
SHANTl:
I came to save you
MOWGLI:
Save me? From what?
That wild bear
that carried you off.
What wild...
Rrraaarrr!
[Gasps]
[Roaring]
Aah!
Baloo, don't!
No, no, no! Stop! Wait!
Uhh! Aah!
- Ow! Oh!
- Aah!
Roar. Boh! Boo!
Ohh. My poor sneezer
That hurt.
You come anywhere near Ranjan,
and I'll really show you hurt.
- Wait! Whoa!
- Don't make me do it!
Wait, wait, wait!
Calm down! It's OK.
But he's attacking us!
BALOO: Attacking?
I'm the one that got socked
in the schnozzle!
Well, that's because
you scared her.
But you... you told me
to scarify her!
- What?
- No, no, no, no.
I... uhh!
Mowgli, you planned this?
Well, I, um...
- Uhh. Come on, Ranjan.
- No, Shanti, I can explain!
Don't even bother.
MOWGLI: Shanti. Wait!
Ohh, man, you weren't kiddin'
about her. She's bad news.
No, she's not!
She was just trying to help...
and you scared her!
Man alive. First, you tell me
to scare her...
then you tell me
not to scare her.
Kid, I only got so much room
up in this noggin...
and it's fillin' up fast!
You just don't understand.
All right. How's about
layin' it out for me?
[Sighs]
Read you loud and clear, kid.
You wanted that girl
to find you.
Ehh!
[Running off]
[Sighs]
Shanti!
Shanti!
Where are you?
Unh.
Come on!
There you are!
I'm so sorry.
W-will you let me explain?
Uh...
Come on, at least talk to me.
[Gasps]
[Growls]
You seem surprised to see me,
man-cub.
[Chuckles] I can't imagine why.
I wasn't going to let you get
away with what you did to me.
You see. You humiliated me.
Man-cub
Surely you do realize
I simply can't let you live.
[Gasps]
Run!
[Growls]
- Unh!
- Arr!
Oh, you're going to try
and outrun me.
How droll.
[Panting]
Come on, this way!
[Growls]
[Panting]
Huh... uhh!
Uhh!
All right, stay here.
Mowgli, no!
[Roars]
Ranjan, wait here.
I gotta go help Mowgli.
But I want to help Mowgli, too!
No, no.
I... I'll be right back,
I promise.
Don't move.
[Stretching]
[Grunting]
Whoa!
Unh!
[Gasps]
Whoa. Whoa. hold still
Calm down, kid.
Now, where's Mowgli?
Shere Khan!

[Roars]
[Chuckles]
[Panting]
KHAN:
No matter how fast you run
no matter where you hide
I will catch you.
[Panting]
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.
[Breathing heavily]
RANJAN: Hurry! Hurry!
Faster! Faster!
[Gasps] Not another man-cub.
Can't you go any faster?
[Gasps] Baloo!
What... what is
the meaning of this?
- Mowgli's in trouble!
- Shanti, too!
Who's Shanti?
[Panting]
Huh... uhh!
[Panting]
[Gasps]
[Panting]
Oh.
[Thunder]
Take the kid, Baghee.
I'll help Mowgli.
Baloo!
[Thunder]
Be careful.
[Panting]
[Rock crumbles]
Hmm? Mowgli?
[Whispering]
Mowgli, is that you?
[Rock clatters]
[Gasps] Mowgli?
[Thud]
Unh!
[Both gasp]
- You!
- You!
- You stay away from me!
- What are you doing here?
Hey, I'm here because
when a member of my den...
[Both talking at once]
I was attacked by a snake,
but I really don't care!
BOTH:
I am here to help Mowgli!
- You what?
- You are?
I guess we're on the same side.
I guess so.
- OK.
- OK.
All right, you, uh, go that way.
I'll cover you.

Hello, Stripes!
You're looking a bit
down in the mouth today.
[Laughs]
Oh, no.
Hey, hey, what's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?
[Laughs]
Oh, I always said
you had a good head...
on your shoulders,
Khannie me boy.
[Laughs] Oh, this is fantastic,
playing to a captive audience.
I just love it. [Laughs]
[AII laugh]
Bagheera.
- Hey.
- Mowgli.
[Laughs] It's awfully good
to see you, man-cub.
Come on, come on, follow me.
Bagheera, this is Shanti...
my best friend
from the village.
FATHER: Shanti!
MOTHER: Mowgli!
[Gasps] There they are!
- Papa! Whoo-hoo!
- Come on, Mowgli.
[Softly] Um...
FATHER: Mowgli!
- Shanti!
- Shanti!
Mowgli, I have to go.
MO THER: Mowgli!
[Dramatic music playing]
Well, come on, Mowgli.
Uh...
Come on, Ranjan.
Uh...
[Sighs]
Uh...
Uhh.
Aw, Baloo.
It's OK, kid.
That girl isn't so bad
after all, now, is she?
Go on, Mowgli.
Really?
Really. Don't let her get away.
Come with me.
Now, you know I can't do that.
I'm going to miss you,
Papa Bear.
Me, too, Little Britches.
Me, too.
[Dramatic music playing]
[Sighs]
All right.
Ahem. There. Come on, now.
You better hurry up.
[Sighs]
[Sniffles]
[Sighs]
<i>MOWGLI: Hey. Wait up!</i>
[Gasps]
Mowgli!
[Laughs] What took you so long?
[AII laughing]
Race you back.
Come on, Ranjan.
RANJAN: Whoo-hoo!
[SHANTl:
Wait. Wait! We're over here!
- Shanti!
- We've found the children!
- Ranjan!
- Mommy!
You gave us quite a scare.
Shanti,
I was so worried about you.
I'm OK. Mom, I'm so sorry.
I was just trying
to help Mowgli
I'm sorry, sir. It's just...
No, Mowgli. I'm sorry.
I should've understood...
that the jungle
is a part of who you are.
[Dramatic music playing]
I'm just glad you're safe.
RANJAN: Papa!
- Ranjan.
- You won't believe it.
There was a big old snake,
and I beat him up.
Ha ha! Of course you did.
I'm proud of you, Baloo.
- That was a very brave thing...
- Uh, Baghee?
Don't go getting any ideas
about running after them...
and trying to talk them
into staying here with us.
He belongs in that village,
and you know it.
- Oh, really?
- Yes, really.
He's got
his whole future there.
I'm sorry, Baloo.
You're absolutely right.
[Sighs]
I'm really going to miss
that kid.
Me, too.
[Sighs]
Wait a minute.
I'm having myself an idea.
Baloo...
[Pop] Heh heh!
Come on, Mowgli, we'll be late.
OK. Unh.
I'm, uh, right behind you.
- Ooh!
- Oops.
Just, uh, getting some water.
[Laughs] All right,
but be careful, son.
Oh, I will. See you, Pop.
Heh heh.
Let's see if he remembers...
to actually bring back
some water this time.
Hey, Shanti, let's remember...
to actually bring back
some water this time.
[Laughs]
Unh. Uhh.
[Snap]
[High tapping]
[Low tapping]
Yeah, man!
Man, that beat is chillin' me.
- Hiya, Papa Bear.
- Hey, there, Little Britches.
Shanti. Ha ha ha!
[Laughs]
Ranjan?
Oh! Ow!
[Laughs]
Unh! Unh! Unh!
[Slap]
