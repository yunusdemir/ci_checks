BOOTH: <i>It's Mark Kovac.</i>
<i>This is our guy.</i>
<i>Says here that General Josip</i>
<i>Radik was shot at long range</i>
<i>during his son's</i>
<i>sixth birthday.</i>
Did you kill my father,
Agent Booth?
CAROLINE:
<i>There's been a shooting.</i>
<i>It was the safe house</i>
<i>where we put Max</i>
<i>and the kids.</i>
(monitor flatlines)
MONTENEGRO:
<i>I just got a location</i>
for Kovac's phone.
It's in a moving car,
headed south.
The FBI already dispatched
a SWAT unit.
This is revenge.
<i>They won't be satisfied</i>
<i>until they kill.</i>
We got to get everybody
out of here.
<i>The bomb is here.</i>
I know how to find Kovac.
Forget about the evidence! I
have to get you somewhere safe.
SAROYAN:
The door! It's closing!
HODGINS:
Booth, did you find it?
(beeping)
MONTENEGRO:
What is happening?
BOOTH: <i>The bomb is</i>
<i>on an electronic repeater!</i>
Which means there's
more than one. Angie!
Bones, where are you?!

REPORTER:
<i>Breaking news: there's been</i>
a massive explosion
in mid-city Washington.
(phones ringing, urgent chatter)
Reports place the blast
at the Jeffersonian Institution.
Reports indicate
a series of explosions...
(groans) Come on.
Aubrey.
I still can't reach Booth.
And he was going to the lab?
That's what he told me.
I got to get down there.
I'll make sure
these sweet little angels
stay safe.
You make sure you bring
their parents back!
Booth, Booth!
HODGINS:
Dr. B!
Brennan!
Bones!
Brennan!
Bones!
I'm hearing that
both entrances collapsed,
they are completely filled
with rubble.
CAROLINE: This is bad.
This is worse than bad.
We can't make contact.
First responders say
it's gonna take hours
to dig their way in.
Well, make them work faster.
AUBREY: Okay, listen, uh,
Caroline, there's more.
I just got word from the team
that went after Kovac.
Please tell me
that son of a bitch
is either dead or in custody.
And if I have a choice,
I choose dead.
Yeah, well, I'm afraid
that it's neither.
The phone was a decoy, okay?
It was taped to the bottom
of a delivery van.
(sighs)
Bones.
HODGINS:
Booth, do you have anything?
I got nothing yet!
Bones!
Oh. Oh, God.
(grunts)
(panting)
Okay.
Easy, I got you. Oh.
Right here.
Stay with me.
Stay with me.
Bones? There...
There you are.
That's it, open up.
Open your eyes. Let me see them.
I'm right here.
Come on, Bones. Wake up.
Temperance.
Stay with me.
There you are.
I'm right here.
Bones. Ah, are you...
(coughing)
Okay, all right, okay.
VAZIRI:
Aubrey!
SAROYAN: They're, um...
Hey, w-where are the others?
They're still inside. We tried
to go back and get them,
but search and rescue
wouldn't let us in.
Cam, there's nothing else
we could do; we can only hope
they all got to safety.
I've been trying to call. Uh, no
answer yet. Uh, maybe if you...
I-I tried, too. Nothing.
VAZIRI: That doesn't mean anything.
The signal was probably
knocked out.
Right.
Right.
(sirens wailing, urgent chatter)
(grunts) Are Christine
and Hank okay?
No, no, hold on.
Just don't move. They're safe.
They're safe.
They're back at the FBI.
All right? They're safe.
(coughing)
(panting)
I feel different.
That was a
huge explosion.
Three bombs, maybe more.
If Booth hadn't
defused the one
under the platform,
we'd all be dead.
Cam and Arastoo got out, and
they're going to bring help.
I was looking at something.
What was that?
It doesn't matter, Bones.
No, Booth, this is important.
I need to kn...
(sighs)
I need-- What was I doing
before the explosion?
I think you were
in your office.
What are we working on?
HODGINS: We're working on
Fred Walden's remains.
I mean, he's the prisoner
that escaped with Kovac.
Something about Kovac--
you knew how to find him.
What is it?
Femur, scapula,
ulna, mandible.
I don't know what that means.
MONTENEGRO:
Yes, yes, you do.
Th-They're bones.
I know.
I-I just don't understand
their significance.
BOOTH:
Well, it doesn't matter.
You'll figure it out later.
No, Booth!
Something is wrong with me.

BOOTH: Got to be kidding.
Damn it!
Front and back exits
are both completely blocked.
It would take hours
to clear a path.
BOOTH:
There's got to be another way.
You saw Dr. Brennan.
I-I... I got to get her
out of here.
Is there any other exits
or anything?
Listen, other than
the basement access,
these are the only two exits
in the lab.
Ironically, for safety.
I'm not
buying that, okay?
There's got to be
something else--
a ventilation shaft,
a heating duct.
There's-there's got to
be something. Think.
Booth, a bomb went off
in one of the biggest
public institutions
in all of D.C.,
all right?
Rescue teams have
got to already
be on their way!
All right, listen.
I'm sorry, but do you hear
anything? 'Cause I don't!
I don't hear any drilling
or any rescue attempt,
so come on!
Let's go!
Help me with this stuff.
Damn it.
MONTENEGRO:
<i>Hodgins and Booth</i>
are-are trying
to find a way out,
and I managed
to score us some water
from one of
the tech stations.
What are those for?
Oh, uh, Hodgins says that,
uh, a stethoscope and a beaker,
used together,
are almost as accurate
as a fetal Doppler, so...
Really?
Yeah.
You taught him that.
Okay, lie down.
He said you put the stethoscope
under the beaker,
and it amplifies the sound.
Anything?
Th-This is not the
appropriate device.
I-I'm not a medical doctor.
I'm not processing
with my usual...
So you're saying
you can't find it?
No, not yet.
What?
What is it?
Listen.
(muffled heartbeat)
(chuckles softly)
What is that?
That's the other bomb.
What-- I thought
you defused it.
Yeah, well, I did,
but you know what,
maybe we could use it
to spark it back up
and blow ourselves right out of
this wall, right here.
Come on. Come over here and
help me get this thing going.
Yeah, I would love nothing more,
but unfortunately,
this building is not gonna
survive another blast.
Stop! Do you understand me?
Stop. You-you saw Bones.
She's got some kind of
a-a head trauma.
She could be bleeding
in the brain.
I watched my pregnant wife
get thrown against a wall!
All right? You're not the only
one who wants out of here!
Then come on over here and
help me get this thing going.
You're not listening, Booth!
It's too risky!
You were trained in munitions!
You know this!
You don't have to be a hero!
I don't need a shrink right now.
You understand me?
I just...
I just got to get out of here.
(sniffs)
Listen.
(clears throat)
Booth, I...
I know I've said a lot of things
over the years
about you being a sniper.
I was wrong.
Killing Kovac's father--
that was the right thing to do.
(rumbling in distance)
You hear that?
Hey!
We're in here!
(thumping)
(men shouting)
Anyone in here?!
MAN:
Anybody alive?
I see somebody!
We got movement!
Hey!
(urgent chatter)
Hey, hey, hey!
Cam, look!
SAROYAN:
Oh, my...
Thank God
you're alive.
Hank and Christine?
Th-They're safe;
they're at the FBI
with Caroline till we get Kovac.
Which means you
don't have him yet.
AUBREY:
You need to sit down. Come on.
He was right next to me.
MAN: Just see them.
I'm happy the little guy's okay.
How do you know it's a guy?
Just got a feeling.
MAN:
Okay, Dr. Brennan,
close your eyes. Now,
I'm gonna touch one of your
fingers, and you try to touch
the corresponding finger on your
other hand with your thumb.
Okay?
So I'm just gonna go over some
results with the neurologist,
and be right back.
BOOTH:
Bones?
What's going on?
I don't know.
What do you mean you don't know?
What-what... what did he say?
What did the doctor say?
I-I don't...
I don't know.
Cam, what's going on?
The good news is, the CT shows
there's no internal bleeding.
But?
You have a contusion
on your corpus callosum.
That's the structure
that allows the two hemispheres
of the brain to communicate.
I'm sorry. What does that mean
exactly?
Well, it means
Brennan's memories
haven't been compromised,
but, rather, her ability
to process complex information.
I-I have to get back to work.
Dr. Vaziri, stay close
in case I need anything.
No way. You need to rest.
No. Booth, the key to catching
Kovac is inside that lab.
The longer we're out here,
the more time he has
to plan his next move.
I need to get
into the bone room.
So what's the big plan?
Well, these four bones are
the key to catching Kovac.
I'll start there.
Okay, easy. Coming in.
All right, guys, thanks.
Let's go.
Move through it.
Man, are you kidding me?
Whoa.
Oh. The blast emptied out
all the bone storage drawers.
It appears
I'll need Dr. Vaziri's help.
Not just Arastoo.
You're gonna need all the help
that you can get.
KAREN:
<i>Hey, I came as soon as I heard.</i>
Is Dr. Brennan okay?
Well, we just got to
wait. You know, right?
The lab is...
It's-it's a mess.
But it's usable,
and she's there now.
Well, if there's anything
I can do.
There is.
We've still got a killer
and his bomb-happy
accomplice to find.
Kovac had an accomplice?
Well, he was in prison
two nights ago, right?
So he didn't
set off those bombs.
What about security
<i>inside</i> the Jeffersonian?
No. Everything between 2:00
and 3:00 a.m. has been deleted.
This guy is methodical.
Which means it's
high time we all consider
joining Aubrey
in Los Angeles. Maybe Judge Judy
needs a prosecutor.
There's no way I'm running.
Tell you what.
Go get Kovac's ex-wife.
No. You think
she's involved with this?
I-I saw her interview tape.
She looked terrified of him.
Well, she's still our
best link to finding him.
Oh, wow.
Oh, this is...
- This is definitely not good.
- Oh.
Yeah. My servers
are completely destroyed.
But you have backups, right?
I mean, you uploaded everything
into the cloud?
You've been
lecturing me endlessly for years
about how the cloud
isn't secure.
Wait a minute.
You listened to me?
Angela, I'm a known
paranoid conspiracy theorist.
I did.
That's why I brought... this.
What's...?
What's with the key?
What is that, Angie?
You know those black box
recorders on airplanes?
This is my version.
It's a steel frame
box with layers
of paraffin
and insulation inside.
And it contains a full backup
copy of every file in this lab.
You <i>did</i> listen to me.
Don't let it go to your head.
We should get to work.
(clattering, scraping)
Dr. Brennan, look at
this sternal rib end.
The bone is smooth, but the
contour is indented, which means
the age is between 20 and 29,
same as our victim.
Yes. Good work, Ms. Warren.
I concur.
Except, look.
It's also sharp
with irregular projections.
I... don't remember
what that means.
VAZIRI:
It's okay.
It-it just means
that this rib doesn't
belong to our victim.
This is impossible.
There must be
at least 200 different sets of
remains on the floor.
BRAY: It's like excavating
a mass grave.
No, Mr. Bray.
I can assure you, this is
nothing compared to a mass
burial site.
In Guatemala,
in Coban,
I helped exhume over 500
sets of remains,
all innocent
victims of their civil war,
their wrists still tied,
blindfolds over their eyes.
I'm sorry, Dr. Brennan. What
a horrible thing to witness.
You remember that
so clearly.
Does that mean
you're doing better?
I don't know. I...
I mean, I do remember things.
I mean... I-I remember
watching Cam propose to you,
how happy you looked.
I remember that you used
to carry a cigarette
behind your ear to
remind you of your father.
I remember... how
proud you were when your book
was published, even though
I found it to be rather mawkish.
And I remember you
teaching me how to chirp.
Tweet.
Tweet.
And I remember....
fighting off attackers
with you by
my side.
In the Maluku Islands.
I meant the motorcycle bar,
but yes.
The Maluku Islands, as well.
I remember
the day each of you was hired.
I remember the name
of every victim
I've ever identified.
I remember... just how
meaningful this work can be,
but I... I don't remember how...
to do it.
I mean...
I can't make sense
of the evidence.
I don't even...
know what I'm supposed
to do with this.
(footsteps approaching)
Cam.
Good. Look at this.
Is that an explosive from
the bomb Booth defused?
It is, and whoever devised it
mixed some kind of HMX explosive
with a binder material,
most likely some kind of, like,
ethyl silicate resin.
That way,
the material itself
could be molded
into whatever shape
was needed.
Yeah, well,
I'm seeing fingerprints.
Unfortunately, the bad news is,
they're all partials.
Nothing we can use to ID.
However, it also indicates
that the person
who was actually
molding this explosive
was using
their bare hands.
So there might
be epithelials.
Our bomber's DNA.
Yeah.
Listen to me, Mrs. Kovac,
I'm only gonna ask you
one last time. Where is he?
I told you. I don't
know where he is.
No, no, no. No.
No, no. Your husband
calling your phone--
okay, that was a setup.
Look, I know what
you've been through.
I saw the explosion
on the news.
You know more
than what you're telling us,
and you're hiding someone.
What?
You're hiding someone.
No! I am not! I swear to you.
Agent Booth,
two months ago, I found out
my husband's real identity.
Listen
to me, Jeannine.
This is my last offer
to make a deal.
I leave this room,
and it's over.
I swear to you,
I don't know anything
about what Mark has done,
or what he's planning
to do next.
You willing to prove that?
Hey, how's it
going in there?
Slowly.
Were you able to find
any more medio-cam images?
Um.... no more
than I already gave you.
They haven't helped
trigger anything?
No.
Are those photos
from Cam's wedding?
They're from
the reception.
Since we know that Cam's ID was
probably stolen from there,
I thought it might
help us find
something.
That's weird.
Isn't that one
of the waiters?
Yeah, except
he's carrying Cam's purse.
I think this could
possibly be the accomplice
that we're looking for.
When's the last time that
you spoke to your husband?
I spoke to Mark yesterday
in the morning.
He called.
And, uh, did he say
where he was going?
I have no idea
where my husband is.
Well, there's somebody out
there who's been helping him.
Believe me, if I knew
who was helping my husband,
I would tell you.
Well, she doesn't have any tells
to indicate that she's lying.
I don't see anything, either.
Maybe the polygraph will
show us something different.
What do you got?
She passed.
Not even a gray area.
All right.
Just hold her.
I don't care how.
Just keep digging.
Do you understand me?
I'm gonna go check on the kids.
(phone ringing)
What-what is it?
Uh, the fake waiter
who stole Cam's pass--
we got an ID.
I'm coming with you.
Whoa.
Where did everybody go?
Well, I thought
I might be able to make
more progress
if I were alone with the bones,
but... I still can't
make sense of this.
Okay, just go easy
on yourself, okay?
It'll-it'll come back to you.
Is that an X-ray machine?
Yeah.
Hodgins and I were able
to recalibrate it.
The interns thought
that you could use it
to match these bones
to pre-existing x-rays
of the victim's skeleton,
to make sure you've got
the right ones.
Yeah, you-you know,
it was just
a crazy idea.
No. No, it was
an obvious one.
Fundamental... really.
And I still couldn't grasp it.
AUBREY:
So, this is our guy.
This is who stole Cam's ID.
Kyle Capoun, 28, low-level
drug dealer.
How long has this guy been dead?
AUBREY: Less than 48 hours.
KAREN: Listen, the file shows
no history of violence.
Not only that. He flunked
high school chemistry.
AUBREY: I don't think
this guy's our bomber.
So, someone,
someone actually
working for Kovac hires
this guy to steal Cam's ID
and killed him.
AUBREY: Whoever that someone is--
they're still
out there.
Hey, you okay?
Where are the kids?
Agent Karasik-- he
took 'em to the cafeteria
to get something to eat.
Do you want to see 'em?
Yes. No.
(laughs)
I don't want
to worry them.
You okay? Hey.
It's okay.
(sighs)
I know.
I just want to see you.
It's not coming back,
Booth. It's not.
All right, Bones, look,
you got to give it some time,
all right?
I know guys from the service who
have lost their memory, okay,
and it comes back.
No, this is not
just a simple case
of amnesia-- it...
my brain, it's...
it's different.
I mean, I'm... I'm different.
(sighs)
Look, you know what?
You're healing, all right?
You're gonna get better.
What if I don't?
I mean, so much of my life,
my intelligence
is all I've had.
You know, I...
I may not have
had a family,
but I understood things
that nobody else could.
My... my brain, the way
I think, is who I <i>am.</i>
Who I was. I...
(chuckles)
Now I-I don't
know, I'm...
I don't know anything, Booth.
I mean...
If the thing that made me... me
is gone...
who am I?
(clears throat)
You're the woman I love.
You're the one who kissed me
outside of a pool house
when it was pouring rain.
You took me to shoot Tommy guns
on Valentine's Day.
That's who you are.
You're the one
who proposed to me
with a stick of beef jerky
in her hand,
even though you're a vegetarian.
You're the Roxie to my Tony,
and... the Wanda
to my Buck.
(chuckles)
Who else is gonna sing
"Hot Blooded" with me?
Hmm?
And besides...
(chuckles)
...we're way better
than Mulder and Scully.
I don't know what that means.
I don't care
if you know about
the bones or...
if we know
how to solve crimes.
All I know is that I want
to spend the rest of my life
with you.
This is you.
Temperance Brennan.
You.
You're my partner.
(softly):
Don't forget that.
Hey.
(chuckles)
HODGINS:
Hey, I think we got something.
Not yet. It's
just a partial.
Am I reading that right?
I think so.
Let's run the DNA again.
There must have been a mistake.
(phone ringing)
Thank you.
Hey, Cam.
So, we were able to isolate
the bomber's DNA.
Any matches in the system?
Not exactly.
BOOTH: What does that mean?
SAROYAN:
It was a partial match,
for Kovac.
Since Kovac didn't escape until
What?
after the bombs were set,
there must be a relative
we don't know about.
The DNA was female.
A mother,
a sister.
It's Jeannine.
His wife? Do you think
she was hiding someone?
That's how she passed
the polygraph.
I mean, look at her answers.
"No, I have no idea
where my <i>husband</i> is."
Wh-What's going on?
It's Jeannine.
Kovac is not her husband.
He's her brother.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
It was you. It was you!
Whoa! What? Agent Booth,
It's all right.
- Sit down. Lose the act.
- what... what's happening?
I'm here to help.
I told you I don't know
where my husband is.
All right,
how about your brother?
What are you talking about?
BRENNAN: Stop lying!
We know Mark Kovac is
your biological sibling.
That's sick.
You're accusing me of incest?
No, we're accusing you of murder,
and that's just for starters.
We found your DNA on the explosive.
The whole marriage thing,
that was a cover--
almost worked,
but it didn't.
You've been working with him
this whole time!
You plotted to kill me
and my children!
BOOTH: All right, all right.
You murdered my father!
Really? Your father's blood
is on your husband's hands.
So now you know
how it feels
to have your father murdered
right in front of you.
My husband was doing
his duty.
Hiding behind patriotism...
Stop! Stop.
Tell us where your brother is,
and no one else has to die.
We found something
odd in the remains.
Several of the bones
feel lighter than normal.
And get this--
they're the same bones that
were on Dr. Brennan's list.
 And you're hoping that
if Brennan sees this evidence
then she's gonna recall
what happened.
Exactly.
Yeah. It's just,
it's not gonna work.
- Excuse me?
Brennan isn't Brennan
anymore, all right?
And we just... we
have to accept it.
I mean, maybe someday...
So we're just supposed
to give up on her?
DAISY: I refuse
to do that.
Dr. Brennan saw something
in these remains.
HODGINS:
Okay.
Then it's up to you
to find it.
Look, Brennan trained you
for this exact moment.
She's counting on you.
So am I.
Hodgins is right.
We need to channel everything
Dr. Brennan has ever taught us.
Okay, so let's assume that
Dr. Brennan wrote that note
because she noticed the anomaly
in the bones' weight.
What if the bone loss was due
to some kind of malformation
as a child?
BRAY: I remember a case
Dr. Brennan and I worked on,
there was
bone loss due to lead poisoning.
It's possible,
but why would that be significant?
VAZIRI: Hang on. What is...?
Well, it could be dirt.
It's a mark.
Left lateral incisor.
WARREN: Sometimes
Dr. B marks a spot
when she wants enamel taken.
BRAY: She was going to do
a histological analysis
to find out where
the victim lived as a child.
Okay, so childhood home,
lead poisoning.
That's it.
The victim wasn't chosen
at random--
he had to have provided
something Kovac needed.
What did he need?
DAISY: A place to hide.
Kovac has been
completely off the grid
ever since he escaped from prison.
What if our victim knew
a place back where he grew up?
That's why Kovac chose him
to escape with, but once
Kovac got that information...
He killed him.
That's what Dr. Brennan realized.
And once we find out
where the victim grew up, we find Kovac.
New equipment?
Whoa.
Seriously? What exhibit did
you guys steal this from?
(chuckling):
No. Actually,
it was all donated
from the bio-chem department
at Georgetown-- they came
calling almost immediately
after the bomb went off.
Squints
of the world unite, baby.
So...
what are the results?
Were the interns right?
Well, we've got
high levels
of lead, arsenic and PCB,
which actually
will weaken the bones
and likely cause
speech difficulties,
headaches and nausea.
SAROYAN:
Okay, can we match these levels
to any specific Superfund sites?
What I can do
is combine the data
that I've got with other
isotope levels that I found.
Okay, there. In West Virginia.
SAROYAN: That's a mostly
agricultural area.
Angela, start checking
property deeds.
Look for any owner
with a connection to our victim.
Relatives, friends...
Okay.
I'm on it.
(sighs)
BOOTH:
<i>Farm's about 20 miles ahead.</i>
Aubrey and a few SWAT guys
are gonna meet me there.
All right? I just want
you to stay in the car.
No. Where you go, I go.
(sighs) All right, fine.
Just be careful, all right?
Listen, Bones,
I just want to...
say again how sorry I am...
No.
No apologies.
But what you said
to Jeannine about
me doing my duty,
it was, uh,
still my choice.
It always is-- every
time I take a shot, I...
I take responsibility for that.
I know.
And that's why
I stand beside you.
Always.
Okay, here's what we're
gonna do, okay?
Two teams.
I'm gonna lead one.
Aubrey, you're gonna
lead the other one.
I'm gonna go left,
you're gonna go right,
you understand me?
We're gonna
flank the barn,
get into position
before we hit the house.
We're not gonna hit it
till we got support
from the chopper
overhead, you got it?
All right. Also, uh, everybody
look out for tripwires.
This guy knows
explosives.
Just be careful.
I love you.
I love you, too.

BRENNAN: Booth...
BOOTH:
My hand. I can't move my hand.
BRENNAN:
Okay, we got to go!
We gotta go!
My gun! I can't get my gun!
I can't move my hand.
(gunfire continues)
(bullets ricocheting)
Come on, Bones.
Let's go.
Easy. Easy, damn.
(grunts)
Booth!
Oh, my hand.
My hand, I can't move my hand.
Oh, God. I...
I can't... (groans)
Booth, I know
what's wrong with you.
What?
You have isolated volar distal
ulna dislocation, which means
all I need to do is...
(loud crack)
Aah! Bones!
You did it.
You did it.
(groans)
(helicopter approaching)
Okay, I have
a red eye for you...
Mm.
...a decaf almond milk
cappuccino for you...
Oh, thank you.
...and, ah!
Dr. Brennan, perfect.
Here. Green tea.
Oh. Th--
Uh, what are these for?
I, uh, just got word
that the major repair work
is starting tomorrow morning,
which means this is the last day
we can be in the lab,
until the work is done.
HODGINS: What about our stuff?
Well, I'm gonna need you
to pack up and label anything
you don't want thrown out,
leave those boxes
in your office,
and take with you anything
you don't want put in storage.
Okay, now I know why you're
plying us with, uh, caffeine.
Hey, how did it go
at the doctor's?
My agnosia's almost gone, so...
I'm going to be okay.
Good.
MONTENEGRO: They won't
change it much,
will they?
Well, they'll try not to, but...
you know how it is.
Everything changes.
SAROYAN:
Okay.
Grab some boxes.
Get to it.
Yep. (clears throat)
(sighs)
Seeley Booth.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Get your broad
shoulders over here.
Hey, look at you.
Good morning to
you, too, Caroline.
Don't you be glib.
You almost went
and got yourself killed, again.
When are you ever
gonna stop doing that?
Probably never.
You and your damn sense of duty.
Do you have any idea
how stressful it is
for me to have
such a brave friend?
Well, you know the saying.
Once a Ranger, always a Ranger.
That's not the Ranger slogan,
Aubrey.
Oh. I'm thinking
of Power Rangers.
CAROLINE:
Well, I'm off
to the courthouse,
gonna make sure Jeannine Kovac
never sees another free day
in her life.
Let me know
if you need anything.
Will do.
Why are you holding a plant?
Oh. Uh, it's for
the new office.
You like it?
Are you gonna take
that plant across the country?
Uh, no, actually.
SSA Halko's retiring.
Deputy Director
offered me his spot.
(chuckles)
Meaning same promotion,
but here in D.C.?
Yeah, no.
I thought I wanted to move, but
after everything that's happened
in the last couple of days, I
realized this is where I belong.
CAROLINE:
Well, I for one
will be happy to see you
around, and I'm guessing
there's a certain quirky,
red-headed anthropologist
who might also be
happy to hear this?
Yeah. She, uh...
she broke up with me.
Oh, <i>Cher.</i> Sorry.
You okay?
No. But I will be.
Aubrey.
Booth.
Yeah. Get that plant
off my desk.
(elevator bell dings)
Hi.
Hey.
I just delivered
two buckets of fried chicken
to your office.
Really?
Wow. To celebrate?
Or commiserate.
I heard about your breakup.
And in my
professional opinion,
emotional eating always helps.
Thanks.
Yeah.
Are you hungry?
Yeah.

My boxes are labeled.
You ready to tell them?
Let's do it.
ANGELA: Oh, my God.
Hodgins. I found it.
HODGINS:
You did?
Angie, that's amazing.
What is that?
It's the project that Angie
and I have been working on.
Come here. You got to
see this. Come here.
You got to show them.
What is it?
We thought it was destroyed.
Here.
(Brennan laughs)
It's a children's book,
so I'm doing the text,
and then Angie, she's been doing
all the illustrations.
BRENNAN:
Wait.
We're in it.
Brennan the beetle,
Cam the caterpillar.
MONTENEGRO:
Yeah, we're all in it.
It's-it's about us.
(chuckles)
Cam has something
to tell you both.
Yeah. Um... (clears throat)
I haven't been completely honest
with you guys,
because it wasn't official,
but, um...
Arastoo and I aren't actually
going to Europe.
We're going to Mississippi
to...
to pick up our boys.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
Yeah.
What?
Oh, my God, look. Who are
these beautiful children?
That is Tyler.
This is Isaiah,
and the youngest one here
is Jordan.
They're siblings.
BRENNAN:
They're in foster care.
Cam and Arastoo have petitioned
to adopt them.
And this is why you asked
for a leave of absence. Cam...
Yeah. Arastoo
and I both wanted to be around
for a while, full time,
to help them settle in,
and to help us become a family.
Oh, Cam,
that is such wonderful news.
It really is.
We're very happy for you, Cam.
BRENNAN:
Now, for the position
of the interim director
of the lab while Cam is away...
HODGINS:
Yes.
Congratulations, Dr. B.
No.
I'm happy where I am.
It's you, Dr. Hodgins.
Me?
Mm-hmm.
Wait a minute.
I'm the king of the lab?
(laughs)
I'm the king of the lab!
Just until I get back.
Don't get too cozy.
Yeah, right.
You try to pry that
scepter from my hands.
And take away my crown.
Oh, hey, hey.
I need a crown.
I need a crown.
King of the lab! Yeah!

Hmm. 4:47.
Why would you
want to be reminded

almost ended, Bones?
Because it didn't.
Yep.
All right.
Well, let's get going.
Uncle Aubrey has the
kids at the diner

Wait.
