There are some seas where
fish swarm in millions...
and plankton blossoms
in vast clouds.
The sheer quantity of life here
is unmatched anywhere in the oceans.
These are the most productive
seas on earth.
They are the Seasonal Seas.
The Seasonal Seas border the
Temperate parts of the world,
where conditions change
through the year.
The seasons also affect
the underwater world.
The power of the sun
is constantly changing.
In the far north during the Summer
there are long hours of sunlight,
but in Winter that dwindles and
eventually there can be weeks of darkness.
The summers are warm and gentle,
the winters racked by savage storms.
In conditions like this life of
any sort has to struggle to survive
January on Sable Island off the
coast of Nova Scotia in North America.
Grey Seals have managed to get ashore
through the crashing breakers.
Gales here can blow for days on end.
Sable Island has the world's largest
colony of grey seals
100,000 come here to breed each year,
just when the weather is at its worst.
To add insult to injury, the pups,
having suckled for only 18 days
are then abandoned.
Their mothers must return to the
sea to find food for themselves.
As yet unable to dive,
the pups are marooned
and sustained by nothing
except their fatty blubber.
It will be five weeks before
they are strong enough to swim,
but by then it will be early spring
and the ocean will be teeming with food.
By May, Spring has reached
the coasts of Scotland.
Underwater it arrived rather earlier.
During March, the seas had warmed enough
to trigger a magical transformation.
These are Phytoplankton,
tiny floating algae,
each much smaller than a pinhead.
And they multiply with amazing speed
to produce more annual growth
than all the plants on land put together.
6 billion tonnes of it.
This immense bloom spreads across
the face of the ocean
and within a couple of months turns
vast areas of it a dense green.
Animal life reacts to
the blooming sea.
Although these polyps look
like small anemones,
They're about to change
into something else.
As they separate, they reveal
themselves to be tiny, common jellyfish.
They are less than
3 millimetres across.
Within a few months they will
have assembled into vast swarms.
Minute copepods are part
of their staple diet.
These appear every spring in vast numbers
and graze on the Phytoplankton bloom.
Their beating legs create currents
that sweep the little algae
into the basket-like filters
around their mouths.
On this microscopic scale,
water is so viscous that
the Phytoplankton can't swim
against the current.
Whilst feeding, sensors on the copepod's
antennae give warning of dangers ahead.
Lighting by lasers reveals that feeding
copepods leave wakes behind them,
rather like jet trails in the sky.
Slightly larger floating predators
are able to use these trails
to find their prey.
A close call - but some predators
are simply too large to avoid.
Jellyfish!
They may appear to be delicate as well as
beautiful, but they are deadly hunters.
With every pulse of the delicate
bells plankton-rich water
is drawn into their lacy throats
and pushed out again,
leaving behind copepods stuck
to the membranes.
A single sea-nettle jellyfish
only a few centimetres
across can collect thousands
of copepods in a day.
So the killing power of giants
like these is hard to estimate.
Each of these jellyfish
weighs up to 30 kilos
and has tentacles stretching
over 8 metres.
But there are even greater dangers
awaiting the copepods.
By the late spring the baby common
jellyfish are fully grown.
They gather in millions, forming
immense swarms hundreds of metres long,
which filter out all the small
planktonic animals in their path.
Nevertheless, there are such
astronomic numbers of copepods
that enough will survive to
form swarms of their own.
A basking shark.
This huge eight tonne fish feeds
on plankton and nothing else.
Every hour it filters a thousand
tonnes of seawater through its gills.
Numbers of these shark appear when
the bloom is at its peak
and travel along those water currents
where the plankton is thickest.
Even so, the supply of plankton
is so abundant
that another group of animals'
is able to share in the feast
animals that live on the seafloor.
Every centimetre of rock is covered
with invertebrates of some kind
anemones, sea squirts,
Gorgonians,
all trapping plankton from
the passing water.
Not all life in the Seasonal
Seas depends upon the plankton.
It's early spring in
British Columbia.
Seaweed has started to grow
slowly in the cold water.
As the hours of sunlight
increase and the water warms,
these small plants turn
into great beds of bull kelp.
The immense 30 metre long strands
have small gas filled floats
which keep them high in the water within
reach of the energy-giving sunlight.
Further south the sunshine
is more powerful,
so here, on the coast of California,
the biggest kelp of all can grow.
This is giant kelp and
by midsummer each plant
is growing in length by
nearly a metre a day.
The main stem is fixed to
the bottom 35 metres below
by a small but immensely
strong holdfast.
Fully grown, these gigantic plants
are a hundred metres long
and they form vast marine forests.
Great schools of fish find
sanctuary here.
These are blacksmith fish.
They are plankton feeders
and whenever it seems safe
they head off into open water to
feed where the plankton is thickest.
But at the first hint of danger...
...they rush back to the
safety of the forest.
Fish are not the only
creatures that shelter here
Californian sea otters gather in the kelp
forest to rest and snooze in safety.
To prevent themselves being carried
away into dangerous open water,
where the big predators cruise,
they anchor themselves by winding
straps of kelp around their body.
Sooner or later,
they have to find food
and that lies on the seabed
a long way below them.
Sea otters, however,
can stay underwater for
up to 10 minutes and that's ample time
to find the shellfish they need.
Many of the smaller creatures that live
in these forests, such as urchins,
graze on the kelp and can seriously damage
it if their numbers are unchecked.
The sea otters, however,
feed on some of these grazers
and prevent them getting
too numerous.
So, in effect, the Sea Otters
are the guardians of the forest.
Garibaldi fish do not,
in fact, damage the kelp.
If anything, they help it
by picking off tiny animals
that in places encrust the leaves.
They graze on bryozoans,
tiny colonial animals,
which build their colonies like
a patchwork of white skins on the leaves.
When night falls there are fewer
predatory fish around
and the bryozoans emerge from
their white shelters.
Now, just like coral polyps
they start filtering out
the plankton under cover of darkness.
They are not the only animals
to venture out at this time.
This is an amphipod, just two
centimetres long and it does eat kelp.
In turn, it is excellent food
for many predators.
To protect itself it produces silk,
just like a spider,
and uses it to sew together two sides
of a kelp frond and so form a shelter.
This one is in particular need of
a secure home. She's a mother.
There are over fifty youngsters
clustered on her abdomen,
so her home is becoming
somewhat cramped.
They will soon be old enough to leave
and now whenever she can,
she kicks them out to get a taste
of the outside world.
Dawn.
Beds of eel grass grow in the shallows
between the kelp forest and the shore.
A harbour seal has found
sanctuary here,
and is sleeping after
a hard night's foraging.
But not for long.
A male seal gives a wake up call.
More seals are attracted
from all directions.
It's June, the time when
young male harbour seals
start their strange mating displays.
One listens attentively to the
grunting noises made by the other.
These calls are almost certainly
a way of establishing
which of the two will be dominant.
But if the animals are closely
matched in size and experience
grunts won't settle the issue,
the rivals will have to come to blows.
And seals can be surprisingly violent.
In a month's time the breeding
season will start
and then fights will be in earnest.
But now in mid-summer these
exchanges are harmless.
They're just playing.
Many of the creatures that
shelter in the kelp
have to venture out in order to feed.
A bat ray, for one.
Unlikely though it seems,
the sandy floor of the open sea is,
for the bat ray, a rich feeding ground.
There is food hidden within the sand
and the bat ray has a special
technique for finding it.
It uses jets of water to blow the sand
aside and expose small invertebrates.
A kelp bass hangs about alongside,
waiting for scraps.
Other hunters are also on the prowl.
The fan tailed sole.
There are mantid shrimps here,
living in tunnels.
But once again, hunger compels
them to venture into the open.
That, of course, is a gamble.
They will either eat...
...or be eaten.
A sea slug, called Janolus.
Its colours suggest that it's
poisonous and so it is,
to everything except another
kind of sea slug
the predatory Navanax.
Navanax pulls itself along the trail of
slime that Janolus leaves behind it.
Once caught, Janolus rolls
into a ball...
All Navanax gets is a few
yellow tentacles.
And Janolus is swept to safety
by the current.
It's now mid-summer and the sun
is shining at full strength.
The increasing warmth is the cue
for an Atlantic lobster
to start on a long journey.
She has spent the winter 250 metres down,
far beyond the reach of the storms.
But it was cold down there and
now she needs to find warmer water,
so she's marching towards
the shallows.
They, however, are 150 kilometres away.
After a month of walking she finally
arrives at her favoured sand bank.
But she's not the first here.
Dozens of other lobsters have already
dug themselves homes in the sand
and they don't intent to
surrender them to newcomers.
Size counts for everything
in these battles.
The new arrival is in urgent need of a pit
and since she weighs a hefty 7 kilos,
she stands a good chance
of getting one.
She's won.
These battles continue for the
next two months and they're crucial,
for the females must
have both shelter
and warm water if they're
to raise their young.
For the last seven months, each of
these females has been carrying
around about twenty thousand
fertilised eggs.
But their task is approaching
its end.
The warmth of the shallows is
speeding the eggs' development.
Two more months and the eggs
are ready to hatch.
At first, they're not
very good at swimming.
But within a few minutes the babies
are able to set off in a purposeful way.
At this time of year the sea
is full of larval animals
this one is a 1 day old lobster.
And this... a 3 week old crab, just
ready to start its life on the sea floor.
Its feet touch the bottom
for the first time.
At this stage in its life it's a
vegetarian, with a taste for sea lettuce.
As it grows, so it will repeatedly moult
and expand into a bigger, thicker skin.
The chances are it will be eaten,
but if it survives for five years
it will have become a magnificent
armoured giant.
Now it eats meat and special adaptations
enable it to hunt in the dark.
Its jointed feet are
covered in sensors,
which detect the slightest chemical
change in its surroundings.
And as it walks through the darkness
its feet can, literally taste the sand.
As soon as it finds suitable food,
it passes it forward to its
powerful crushing claws,
which make light work of
the soft flesh.
And those claws are also
very useful for defence.
A one and half metre long
common octopus glides by.
The jet propelled giant is
both powerful and very clever.
With octopus about, it's risky for
even a crab to be in the open.
Even in the dark, the octopus's eyes
are sensitive to the slightest movement.
Against a hunter like this,
the crab's claws are useless.
Late summer in South East Alaska.
The water is still warming and mysid
shrimp are swarming near the surface.
It's a final feast for Pacific salmon,
returning to the coast from
the open Pacific.
They are heading inshore to breed
and they arrive in huge numbers.
They have to swim far up
the rivers to spawn,
but this river's level
is still too low
they'll have to wait
until rain causes it to rise.
So, for now they are trapped
in the sea,
close to the shore,
the worst place to be.
A three metre long salmon shark,
a close relation of the great white.
This one has sensed minute electrical
signals from the salmon nearby.
Shark can maintain their blood
temperature at a higher level
than the surrounding sea water.
And that means they have
the energy to be quick.
Quicker even than salmon.
Early autumn in Vancouver Island
in Canada, 600 miles to the south.
The ocean temperature
is slowly dropping.
Forty metres below the surface,
this year's baby herring are feeding
on the last of the summer's plankton.
Their movements attract attention
from the skies above.
Gulls can't dive, so for now
the fish are still safe.
But there are birds which can dive.
Auklets and murres swim effortlessly
down beneath the school.
The panic herring
a force towards the surface.
They gather into a giant defensive
ball of swirling fish.
The commotion attracts
Yellowtail rockfish.
They too are hunters.
The marauding fish scatter
the herring.
Repeated attacks split the ball
into numerous smaller groups.
Now it's easier for the divers to keep
the confused fish penned
at the surface
and there even the gulls
can get at them.
Attacked from all sides, the little
fish have virtually no chance.
More and more divers are
attracted to the scene.
They harry the shrinking numbers
of herring right down
to the very last individual.
Far bigger predators cruise here, too.
Pacific white-sided dolphin.
But the dolphin are mainly
nocturnal hunters
during the day they concentrate
on socialising.
They display by releasing streams
of bubbles and they play games...
...games like pass the seaweed,
for example.
Exactly eight months ago in the
winter off the west coast of Scotland
an egg was laid - and securely
fixed to a strand of kelp.
Inside, a tiny embryo started
to develop.
Protected by the tough egg case,
it endured the worst of the winter storms.
By summer it was half grown.
Now at last, in the late autumn.
It's nearly ready to hatch.
A fully formed miniature
shark swims free.
This year's plankton will soon die
but the young dogfish
is so well developed that it can't hunt
immediately for larger prey.
The days are getting shorter now.
In British Columbia the
water begins to chill.
This bizarre looking creature
is searching through the kelp for food.
This is Melibe - the hooded sea slug.
It catches plankton with
its net-like head.
As winter approaches
plankton is becoming scarce,
but Melibe is an assiduous searcher.
It can swim.
It flaps away to look for
a better feeding spot.
But its search is becoming
increasingly difficult.
Within the next two weeks most
of the plankton will have disappeared.
As the sunlight becomes
ever more feeble
the kelp starts to die,
gradually rotting away to nothing.
Soon it will be winter.
But 9,000 miles to the south the sun
is rising on a new spring day.
The southern hemisphere too
has Temperate regions
and now the plankton is
beginning to bloom around Tasmania.
Just as in the north,
the Southern Seasonal Seas
also have areas of
rich green water...
...with their own kelp forests
...and their own swarms of plankton.
Some of the inhabitants of these seas
live only in the southern hemisphere.
This is one of them - the handfish.
That strolls around on modified fins.
But when needs must.
It can resort to tail power.
Every summer visitors come
to the shallows around Tasmania.
These are Australian squid.
About half a metre long.
They are here to breed.
The larger males compete for
the attentions of a female
displaying towards her and to one
another by putting on a ballet,
during which they continually change
the colour of their costumes.
Eventually they form pairs.
A male passes a packet of sperm
across to the female.
After the eggs have been fertilised,
they are deposited in tough,
rubbery egg cases that other
creatures find poisonous.
Within three weeks the babies
are ready to hatch out.
They are already able
to change colour
but they're not quite
so good at swimming.
There is another animal here that
is a rather more devoted parent.
This is a male leafy sea dragon,
an exquisitely decorated
relative of the sea horse.
He is carrying his partner's
eggs around with him.
They would be a highly nutritious snack
for any predator that found them.
But that's not easy because
the eggs are attached
to their father's perfectly
camouflaged body.
They could scarcely be
in a safer place.
By November, 10,000 miles to the north,
winter has arrived
Norway now gets less than 5 hours
of daylight in every twenty four.
The temperature is
falling rapidly.
But despite the cold,
the sea is far from deserted.
Every winter, 500 million
tonnes of adult
herring seek shelter in
these deep waters.
They will stay here for four months,
living entirely on the fat
they accumulated during the
summer feasts of plankton.
But they are not alone...
Orca's his small pod is part
of a population
of some five hundred
killer whales
that specialise in hunting
North Atlantic herring.
Using their echo-location
they have detected a shoal
of herring 50 metres below them.
With enough air for a 10 minute dive...
they swim deep below the herring
and drive the fish upwards.
Bubbles stream from the rising fish
as gas in their swim bladders
expands and escapes.
Even an orca finds it difficult
to catch a healthy herring.
But they have a devastating
weapon all their own.
They use their tail to club
the fish with waves of water pressure.
Then it's simply a matter of collecting
the stunned casualties.
The herrings have no chance and both orca
and gulls will eat as much as they can
every day for the next four months.
But there are so many fish wintering here,
over 5 billion individuals,
that the losses are
almost unnoticeable.
Violent as this Winter weather may be
it's essential for the renewal of
the riches of the Seasonal Seas.
Out in the open oceans, the surging
waters stir up nutrients from the depths.
By the end of winter the Seasonal Seas
will be full of minerals once more,
ready for the return of the sun
and the next great plankton bloom
