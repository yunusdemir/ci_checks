<i>Are you there?</i>
<i>I'm here.</i>
<i>Help me.
My client is going to jail.</i>
<i>Oh, no, she's not.</i>
<i>I think I've got it.</i>
<i>Really?</i>
<i>Look up Hasson v. Conrad.</i>
<i>Similar circumstantial evidence...</i>
<i>case was thrown out.</i>
<i>Legaleagle, thank you.</i>
<i>You are by far
the most brilliant mind</i>
<i>in this chat room.</i>
<i>Thank you, Lawyer-girl.</i>
<i>I, uh, realize we have
certain anonymity here,</i>
<i>but... do you, by any chance,
have a name?</i>
<i>It's Charlene.</i>
<i>I missed you yesterday.</i>
<i>How was your day?</i>
<i>Uneventful.</i>
<i>I exercised for an hour
in the morning,</i>
<i>poked around in the yard
in the afternoon,</i>
<i>and visited with a girlfriend
down the block in the evening.</i>
<i>Sounds innocent enough.</i>
<i>Don't let my humdrum day
fool you, now.</i>
<i>I also have a very dark side.</i>
<i>Well, I'm 31,</i>
<i>with long, flowing locks
and an athletic body.</i>
<i>Peter, what do you look like?</i>
<i>I'm, uh... a little older... 6'2".</i>
<i>My hair is, mm, it's light.</i>
<i>Uh, it's... boyishly light.</i>
And good night to you, Lawyer-girl.
Gendler.
- Good morning, Mr. Sanderson.
- Hi.
- Morning, Peter.
- How are you?
Gentlemen.
Oh, good. Peter's here.
We can begin.
Okay.
On to pressing business.
Word has come to us
that coffee heiress,
Mrs. Virginia Arness,
has dismissed
her current tax lawyers.
Virginia Arness.
74 years old, born and raised
in Athens, Georgia.
At the age of 13,
she was shipped off to
boarding school in England,
where she's been residing
until just recently.
- That was only two days ago.
- Impressive.
Now, we've all heard
that Mrs. Arness has
a penchant for thriftiness.
And that she brings new meaning
to the term "conservative".
It's not going to be easy.
She's paranoid
and suspicious. Peter...
I'm her guy.
I'm single.
I'll give her nights, weekends...
Aren't you getting married
on Sunday, Todd?
That's flexible.
And, Peter, I wouldn't want this
to interfere
with your family's
Hawaiian vacation.
You go on.
I got it all taken care of.
Mahalo.
Well, that's
very admirable of you, Todd.
I mean, your... your youth, uh,
definitely makes you an ass...
... set, ugh, to the company,
especially at the annual softball game.
But to an archconservative,
74-year-old woman?
What will we do is not charge
Mrs. Arness one single red cent
for her estate planning.
Why?
Because we don't care
about that measly fee.
We use it as a loss leader
to get her corporate business,
the multibillion-dollar
Arness coffee conglomerate.
Hmm.
How may I help you, Howie?
Just thought I'd congratulate you
on turning it around.
Turning what around?
You snaked Gendler.
Please.
Gendler doesn't bother me.
Oh, that's right.
He doesn't bother you.
What the heck was I thinking?
Listen, I thought
maybe after work
you and me go, uh, tie one on,
maybe check out
some o' the local talent.
Can't. I'm meeting
Mrs. Arness at 6:00.
And by the way,
it's "You and I go tie one on",
not "You and me go".
Somebody messaging you here.
Who's Lawyer-girl?
Nobody.
Whoa. Did someone make
a blind internet date?
No. I mean, you know,
well, technically, but, uh, no.
Uh, I met 'er in a legal chat room.
She's... she's, uh, she's uh,
very classy and smart.
When do you nail 'er?
I'm courting her tonight at 7:00.
Oh, jeez. You're courting her.
Sounds like a hot one.
And this is her?
Yeah, she's attractive, isn't she?
I suppose. I don't know.
It's not my cup of tea.
What do you...
she is universally cute.
Ehh, she's a little too
anemic-looking, Petey.
I like my jello to jiggle,
if I'm not being too subtle. But...
You're not being too subtle.
All right, as long as she spins your knobs,
I'm happy for you.
Have you nailed anyone
since Kate?
You... "Nail"?
I was supposed to call 'er.
Uh, Sofia, can you get my wife
on the phone?
- Ex-wife.
- ... Uh-uh, ex-wife on the phone?
<i>Right away.</i>
Can't help you with this one, pal.
See you later.
Peter, you cannot break
another promise to these kids.
You can't. You just can't.
I said I couldn't take 'em
to Hawaii.
I didn't say
I couldn't take 'em.
They can spend the week with me.
<i>They are gonna be
so disappointed.</i>
I can't talk to you right now.
Um... Daddy can't take you
to Hawaii.
- Oh, darn.
- He always does this.
- Sanderson, party of two.
- Oh, you're the last to arrive.
- How long has she been here?
- Mmm, about 20 minutes.
Was she trouble?
Thank you.
Hello.
I'm Peter Sanderson.
Well, I'm glad
they didn't send a child.
I told them I specifically wanted
someone my own age.
What a wonderful French bulldog.
My mother had one.
They make great companions.
What's her name?
His name... is
William... Shakespeare.
Well, of course.
Now, I've heard about
your unfortunate escapade.
I don't have escapades.
Fiasco with your previous attorney.
The man was a thieving criminal.
Just because I have
a lot of money
doesn't give people
the right to overcharge.
I do not enjoy
being taken advantage of.
Which is why
our service is free of charge.
After all, you worked hard
for your money.
I'm an heiress.
An heiress who worked hard
to keep her money.
- Now, shall we get down to business?
- Fine.
So, now you may hand over
your proposal.
I'll take it with me.
Proposal? Um...
Well, I was expecting
to meet with you tomorrow.
I was assured the proposal
would be ready for this afternoon.
I see no point
in our meeting tomorrow.
Excuse me.
Madam, I'm sorry.
We have a no-dog policy
in the lounge.
Unfortunately, I'm gonna have
to ask you to remove the dog.
Excuse me.
I am Mrs. Arness' attorney,
and because there is no sign
posted regarding dogs,
that means there is
no policy toward dogs.
Now, if you want to avoid
a legal situation,
I would suggest
you run to the kitchen
and get some tuna tartare
for William Shakespeare
on the house.
Yes, sir.
I'm terribly sorry, ma'am.
Where and when tomorrow?
Hello, Mr. Sanderson.
Oh, Mrs. Kline.
Always a pleasure.
And when am I going
to get to babysit
with your charming
little Georgey again?
Oh, uh, well, uh, soon,
because he just... loves
coming over to your place.
Uh, Mr. Sanderson?
Those... Latin people
who were skulking around...
Oh. Uhh, they were looking at
the Aruda house.
Casing it?
No, uh, to buy it.
Oh, please.
If they're in this block and
not carrying a leaf blower, I...
Yeah.
Well... I'd love to, uh, discuss this
with you further,
but I'm expecting someone.
Oh.
Yeah.
Hey.
Hi.
Yeah.
I... hope you like cham...
... poo.
What's up, baby?
Ooh, champagne.
I love champagne.
This for me?
Oh, I'm sorry. I think
you have the wrong house.
It is damn good
to finally connect.
- Pardon me?
- It's me, fool... Charlene.
- Ooh, food.
- What?!
It's me, honey.
Your date, Lawyer-girl.
You can't be.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Leave that alone. Leave it alone.
Well, why can't I?
Because you're not a blonde.
Can't get nothin' past you.
You must be
a bomb-ass lawyer.
Oh, look at all
of these pretty candles...
all romantic and shit.
Somebody was plannin'
on gettin' some booty tonight.
Hey, hey! Leave that alone.
There-there are settings.
And-and you can't be Charlene,
because Charlene is... is, uh, more of, uh...
- Skinny white broad?
- Yeah.
You know, I get that a lot.
But that's your fault
you're thinkin' that, bro.
You must've not 'ave took
a good look at that picture.
I have looked
at that picture a lot,
and trust me,
you are not in it.
Mm-hm.
Move, move, move.
Let me do it. Let me do it.
See?
There I am.
Sorry you got it twisted, dawg.
I don't get a lot o'
photo ops where I been.
Where exactly have you been?
Well, I got a rumble in the jungle.
We still havin' dinner or what?
I asked you a question.
- Rolex.
- Rolex?
I did time, baby,
but I ain't do the crime.
You're a convict?
Bump that.
Shoot,
Roscoe cracked that door.
I kicked it off the heezy
and bounced.
For real, though.
What did you just say?
What, don't you hear good?
All right.
Let's see.
How can I put this? Um...
I was recently liberated
from a correctional facility...
All right. I get it.
You're in the big house, and
you get someone to type for you,
and you get on the internet,
and you misrepresent yourself.
You know, it happens,
and I'm a sucker,
but now you have to go,
because this is over.
Unh-unh. No, no, no, no.
Biscuit,
you misrepresented yourself.
Boyishly light... please. Grey.
You said you was
a criminal lawyer.
I pulled your file.
You're just some sorry-ass
tax attorney.
A tax lawyer is a criminal lawyer.
Oh, yeah?
Well, good.
Cause that's why I'm here.
Well, do tell.
Well... I wanna reopen my case.
And what did you do,
smoke some homies on a drive-by?
Smoke? Homies?
Well, you a regular gangster, huh?
No, man. I was in
for armed robbery, but I didn't do it.
Yeah, well.
Yeah, nobody did it.
I can't be having this conversation
because you're a criminal type.
I'm not a criminal. If I was a criminal,
I would have shanked you
when you were standin' right there and
I had that knife in my hand.
The fact that you even said that
is a problem for me.
- But I didn't think that.
- It's just time to go.
Please, please, just listen to me.
- Just gimme one second.
- No, no, I don't have a second.
Okay. O-okay, okay. Look, look.
Can I just say something, please?
- What?
- I didn't do the crime.
You rude mother...
I ain't goin'.
It's your baby,
Peter, and don't you deny it!
That DNA test told on you!
You lie, Peter!
You know lil' Kareem is yours!
Why?!
How you gonna
do me like that, Peter?!
You told me I was
your beautiful African queen.
And I loved you for that, Peter!
I didn't care if
your little thing was curved.
And lil' Kareem don't want
your child support.
He just want a relationship
with his white daddy.
A little... chocolate/vanilla swirl
from... that magical night
at the crackhouse.
Oh!
Come on. Just be quiet!
Wait just a second. My shoes.
- Mr. Sanderson?
- Whoa!
Is everything okay?
I thought I heard Negro.
No. No Negro spoken here.
Oh.
Well... good night, then.
Oh, uh...
good night.
C'mon!
C'mon, c'mon!
You stay. You stay.
You wait right there.
Who you callin'?
The police.
<i>Police department.
Sergeant Panella. Please hold.</i>
What's that?
It's all of our e-mails.
You think anybody at
Tobias, Kline, and Barnes
would be interested
in hearing
about you lookin' for boom-boom
in the federal pen?
And I'll send a photo.
<i>Thanks for holding.
Can I help you?</i>
Now, this is just
for tonight, understand?
A'ight.
I can work with this.
But, uh, look,
don't be gettin' no ideas
'bout sneakin' up in here
and hittin' this ass,
cause you blew your chance
with this fine sister.
Dare to dream.
Tsk. Please...
Oh, my God! A bed!
Oh, a nice, big, cushy bed.
Ohh, no roommates,
no cellmates...
Charlene?
Charlene.
Charlene! Come on,
you're not fooling anybody.
Who that? Who there?
Who want it with Lene?
I put some bagels outside.
I thought
we could discuss your case.
Ahh!
What up, dawg?
Where 'em bagels at?
Hey, guess what, girlfriend?
Your game is up.
Because I burned
all those e-mails,
including the second set hidden
in the lining of your coat.
And... I deleted
everything off my computer.
So... I never met you,
and you never met me.
Don't even try, girlfriend,
because it's locked.
And now... I am going to go
get my kids,
as in innocent young persons
who will never even know
you were here.
So now just go.
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go!
And... locky-locky!
So, ta-ta. And watch out.
The gate closes automatically.
- What about my stuff?
- Oh, it's right there on the street.
- You put my stuff on the trash?
- Oh. Well, you know what?
I wish you well. I really do.
And... you know what?
I had a great, great time.
It was really fun.
So... Oh, well.
I guess I'll just see you
in my next life.
Bye!
I'll see you
when you get home.
So, I said to 'im
"Just cause you whisked me
out to Paris on your private jet"
"doesn't mean
I'm gonna sleep with you."
What does he think I am?
A hooker?
Can aunt Ashley
edit herself, please?
You stayed
in the same room with him.
What did you expect?
Hello. It was a suite...
plenty of floor space.
Sweetiepie, have
a wonderful time. I love you.
And please be good to your brother
and help him with his reading.
- I will.
- Thank you.
Is he still having problems?
Yeah. Oh, he struggles every day,
but he's improving.
- Dad's here.
- Thank you, sweetiepie.
Don't worry, sweetie.
Daddy's stupid, too,
and he became a lawyer.
- Ashley!
- I'm not stupid.
- That's right.
- No, no, no. Of course not.
- Hey, dad's here.
- Speak of the dummy.
Hey, how's my little girl
doin', huh?
Hi, dad.
Hey, how's it goin', big guy?
Ahh, here you go.
Hi, Kate.
Oh! Ashley, I didn't realize
you were gonna be here.
What a pleasant surprise.
Peter,
you're almost aging well.
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.
I thought we'd go down to the club
and all take a swim. How's that sound?
Ooh, that sounds
much more fun than Maui.
You know, Ashley,
not all of us earn our living
by milking rich geriatrics
out of their money.
Some of us have to work
for a living.
Peter, you sound much more intelligent
with your mouth shut.
Let's not start this.
I don't have time.
Kids, go get your stuff.
All right, fine.
But I warned you
about marrying the first jerk-off
you met out of college.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a date.
Don't be good.
What morgue did you find
this one at?
Stop being so childish.
Hey.
Wow.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
Mm.
Uh, hi.
Uh, Peter... This is Glen.
Hey.
Hey, Mr. Sanderson.
Nice to see you.
Yeah, nice to meet you.
Yeah. Uh... What do you say
we get this road on the show?
Okay.
- I will meet you outside.
- Okay.
- Road on the show.
- Just... don't.
How old is he?
Younger.
- What does he do?
- Golf instructor.
- How do you know that?
- What?!
Well, you think
you know somebody,
and then one day you wake up
in Thailand missing a kidney.
I mean, he could have made up
this whole golf identity.
He caddied for you
when he was 14.
That's little Glenny?
- Does that bother you?
- Not at all.
Go have fun
on your statutory weekend.
This does too bother you.
I know you.
- Do you wanna talk about it?
- Well, look. I mean, it just looks a little silly.
Hang on.
Hello?
- Some things never change.
- I can't talk right now.
Well, put 'im on.
Hi.
You promised us
you'd take us snorkeling.
Things come up.
That's life.
I know. I'm really, really sorry.
I really am.
But now... it's over. It's new.
We're gonna have a lot o' fun.
Now, what's new?
What's new with you?
Well... I got the female lead
in the school play "Oklahoma!".
Hey, that's great.
Congratulations.
And how 'bout you, big guy?
How's school?
I don't like school.
Well, nobody likes school,
but, c'mon, there must be something
you like about it. Well, one thing.
He got into a fight the other day.
Why? Why?
Why'd you get in a fight?
Some kids called me a baby
cause o' the way I read.
Hey, some o' the greatest minds of
all time had trouble learning,
like... Edgar Allan Poe
and... Albert Einstein
and, uh, Ozzy Osbourne.
- Ozzy rules.
- Ozzy rules. Okay.
Dad, what's goin' on?
You two wait here.
I'll be right back.
Hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where you think you're goin', milk?
This here's a charitable event.
You wants to get in,
you gots to make a donation.
Trust me, it is
off the hook in there.
Off the what? I live here.
I don't care
if you're Halle Berry, man.
No donation, no entry.
How 'bout if I call the police?
Have a nice time.
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, baby, show me what there is.
Hey! What the hell
is going on here?
Oh, yo, P., it's cool.
See, I hit up my homegirl
cause I had to get my hair done,
as we both know.
And then she called a friend.
They ho-holler to other friends.
Before you know it,
we got us a house partay.
I want everyone
out of here, now!
People!
People!
Loosen your panties, grandma.
Look, you lock me out,
no money, no place to go.
I mean, a girl gotta get
her cheese on.
Seven.
This is insane!
My boss' sister lives
across the street.
I can't have all these peop...
Hey!
Give me a hard seven, baby.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
She doesn't even have
her driver's permit.
Dad.
Do not go...
Roll! Uh!
Come on.
Don't inhale.
A'ight right, now. Go on
and toss them bones, lil' man.
Hey! Gimme...
I'm on a roll, dad.
Get... out.
I want you and your... dawgs
to go back to the pound, now!
What?
Well, it was she... It was the daws?
Because she said dawgs,
and then I said dawgs,
so I assumed that would be okay.
Huh?
Whoo-hoo!
Bye, Tamika.
Y'all be good, now.
Bye.
Hey, hey.
Y'all gotta go.
- A'ight.
- That's a'ight.
Hey, baby, gonna go.
Oh, bye, Bear.
Thank you so much.
Party's over.
Okay. Thanks for coming.
But that's it. It's over.
All right. If I see Widow around,
I'm-a tell 'im you're out.
You know
he wants to know that.
I don't know about that.
I'll see you.
- Okay. Bye, baby.
- Bye-bye.
It's like this.
Hey.
- How you doin', neighbor?
- What's up?
What are you still doing here?
- What was all that, dad?
- Dad, who's this?
This is no one.
Tsk! What's up, lil' Romeo?
My name is Charlene.
What's your name?
I'm Georgey.
You cannot meet
a nonexistent person.
- Can Charlene come to the club?
- Club? What club?
We're not going to a club,
remember?
We're going to Hawaii,
remember?
Okay, you know the routine.
Outski! C'mon, out!
- Out, out! Let's go.
- Come on, man!
Sarah, get the door.
Come on. Out. C'mon!
Out, out, out!
- Wait!
- What?
Gimme my money, lil' boy.
That money should go
to charity! Ohh!
- What did...
- Hey, I live here.
Yeah!
What?
Okay, you guys.
You-you know, you order hot dogs,
and you, uh, splash and frolic
and just put everything on
my account and... just have fun.
Didn't you bring
your bathing suit?
Oh, uh, no. I gotta...
I'm having tea with a client.
But I will be right back.
Whatever you say.
Wanna go swimming?
With you?
Forget it.
Ow!
How's it looking?
Well, I was up all night
proofing.
It's absolutely brilliant.
And you've got the cleanest
background check I've ever seen.
That up background check
cost me a lot o' fun in my life.
I don't know, honey.
Don't say anything.
She could hear you.
What's crackin', ma?
I'm lookin'
for the Sanderson table.
We old college buddies.
O-o-okay.
He's, uh, i-in the dining room.
I-I'll show you.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
I tell you what. I'll surprise 'im.
No, you're in great shape, Petey.
I'm gonna take off.
All right, all right, thank... I mean, you're right.
Nothing-nothing could go wrong.
I've done this a million times
with important clients, so... I'm fine.
- Shazam.
- What?
Oh, no.
Oh, swing it, you cocoa goddess.
Cocoa goddess? That's the rude shock
I was telling you about.
That's Charlene?
Did she see me?
Okay, okay, okay, police.
Uh, no.
Uh, won't get here fast enough.
Uh, security.
No, she could probably take 'im.
Uh, money.
She'll take money.
Look. Hi, hi. Here, just...
Here-here-here's whatever. Whatever.
And there's more where that came
from if you just leave now.
No. Unh-unh, boyfriend.
We got business.
Boyfriend?
Oh, didn't I tell you?
Yeah, we're dating now.
Look, it's some kinda street talk.
It's street for
"I'm not going nowhere"
"until you help my problem
go away."
Look. Mrs. Arness,
a very important client,
is due here any minute.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
Uh, Mr. Sanderson?
Oh, yes.
He's in the dining room.
Thank you.
Charlene,
how 'bout you and I
havin' a smart cocktail
down by the pool? What do you say?
Who is this fool?
Hey, you know what?
That's a good idea.
Whatever you want,
just put it on my bill.
I don't want no smart cocktail.
I need your help.
Miss.
Another martini.
Oh, hell, no.
I know she ain't talkin' to me.
Ashley,
she doesn't work here.
Well, if she isn't here to work,
then what is she here for?
Oh, hells no, Miss Thing.
You best pump your brakes.
Listen.
She's my ex-wife's sister.
I would have killed her
myself years ago.
It's Mrs. Arness!
Mm. Old Iron Ass be lookin' mean.
Yes, yes. Then you have to go.
You like raw oysters, Charlene?
Yeah. I guess
I can hang out for a bit.
They got any hot wings
around here?
All right, all right.
Whatever you want. Yes, yes, yes.
- You gimme a place to stay?
- Yes.
- And you work on my case?
- Around the clock.
Then I'll leave
when you expunge my record.
Consider it expunged.
A'ight.
I'd like a key, please.
Mr. Sanderson?
Mrs. Arness.
Who is your associate?
Uh, this is, uh, Howie Rottman,
the attorney I told you about.
A great pleasure
to meet you, Mrs. Arness.
I meant her.
Oh.
Her? Her?
Her is... her...
She, uh...
She is our-our nanny.
Dad, I'm bored.
Kids... how good to see you.
Don't we just love
our nanny, Charlene?
Uh, um... Uh... Yeah.
Don't you just love being
our nanny, Char-lene?
Yezer.
Now, I'm-a go on down
to the pool with the child'n.
Maybe we make fun o'
the white folks again, huh, kids? Ooh-hoo!
Oh, the kids just love her.
- What a sense of humor.
- Yeah.
You know, Peter, I'm going to, uh,
hang by the pool.
If you need me,
that's where I'll be.
Mrs. Arness.
- Uh, right this way, Mrs. Arness.
- Come, William.
- You have the papers?
- Oh, yes, yes, I do.
- Strange clothes for a nanny.
- Well, it's just a... it's a fashion to kids.
- Ow! Oh!
- William! Mind.
Hello, Sanderson family!
- Georgey, don't forget poker night!
- I won't.
How could I forget poker night?
- I propose a toast.
- Okay.
Mm-hm.
To us.
May we always...
- Mm.
- Sorry. It's mine.
Oh, you're not gonna
answer that, are you?
Well, it... I... it might be...
might be one of my kids.
Just one minute.
Sorry.
Hello?
Hey, it's me.
<i>Oh, hi, Ashley.
Everything okay?</i>
I don't know.
I saw Peter hanging out
at the club today.
He was mingling with
a large black woman.
What? What are you
talking about?
<i>He said it was his nanny.</i>
<i>She didn't look like any nanny
I'd ever seen.</i>
So... tattooed and benjy
and... welfarish.
<i>It was...</i>
Oh, is that funny to you?
Is that funny?
<i>Am I funny to you?</i>
No, no.
That's not funny.
Were you laughing at me?
Oh, I wasn't...
Stop. Get away.
<i>No, I wasn't la... laughing at you.</i>
Just... hang on.
Um, you know, I, I... Look,
I know Peter. I know him.
He's not gonna spend
all his time taking care of the kids.
He-he went and hired somebody!
Seriously, Kate!
This woman was no nanny.
You need to do something.
<i>I saw this woman.
I was there if you want.</i>
<i>Shouldn't you at least
be looking at references?</i>
Thank you. Thank you.
Listen, Peter is nothing
if not responsible.
It's not like he's gonna
hire a convicted felon.
Oh, I wouldn't be too sure
about that.
Ohh!
Okay. Let's see. We got
resisting arrest, assaulting an officer,
uh, repeated attempts at eye gouging,
and... scrotum crushing.
Well, I was a little riled up,
being framed and all.
And your clothes and ID
were found at the scene.
All plants.
I never robbed nobody!
Okay.
I know my rights.
I get an appeal.
I get an appeal!
No. You only get an appeal if
you were convicted and incarcerated.
You were released.
Look, why don't you just
start over?
Go back to school and get
at least a passing familiarity
with the English language.
I mean, it's no end
to what you can accomplish
with a little commitment.
My daughter Sarah
is fully committed,
and she's going places.
Oh, she goin' places all right.
So, it's a charitable remainder trust.
Yeah, that way the old tightwad gets
a huge deduction every year.
Uh, no more calls, Sofia.
<i>Uh, i-it's not a call.
There's someone here...</i>
<i>Girl, get out!</i>
<i>I do not know who you are...</i>
Send 'er in.
Bet you know me now, huh?
This couldn't wait
until tonight?
Well, well, well!
Come in, have a seat,
spend some time.
Thanks, homeboy,
and, no, it can't wait.
You gotta check this out.
- What is it?
- I found the deposition.
The prosecution interviewed
an eyewitness,
and she told them
that the perpetrator
didn't have a tattoo
on the chest.
They never told my lawyer
about this shit.
That's withholding exculp...
Exculpatory evidence.
People vs. Stanley, I know.
How do you know that?
Why wouldn't she know that?
She's got it goin' on.
Damn, Pete, all I did in there
was read law books.
And with comprehension.
Made you think I was a lawyer.
I mean, you obviously have
pockets of intelligence.
So, why do you walk and talk
and act the way you do?
Because it's sexy.
It ain't actin'!
This is who I am.
I mean, you think
I can't talk like you?
Oh, Peter,
I absolutely love what
you've done with the place!
It's so sterile, so...
so bland, so wonderful!
See? You can do it.
Oh, you like that, huh?
Well, you can kiss
my natural black ass,
because I don't need your approval.
No, she don't need your approval.
Hey, you don't think
I compromise the way I act?
You think I like walking around
like an uptight... honky?
Yes. I know your lingo.
<i>Peter, Mr. Tobias
is coming to see you.</i>
Oh, God.
Well, this should be
interesting.
Uh-oh. What we gotta do,
play "hide the sister"?
Or do I gotta do
that slave thing again?
Just... just act natural.
- Let's get her out of here.
- Why, why don't we get her out?
Peter... Howie.
Ed.
Who is this?
- Uh, thi-this is the...
- Well, we were just having...
Well, Mr. Sanderson, I can see
you are very busy. A very busy man you are.
That's why I really appreciate
you offering your services free of charge.
Oh, I... well, I just... gosh.
Peter...
Well, see, Mr. Sanderson here,
being the heavenly man that he is...
God bless you!
Oh, you got that anointing on you...
... has offered to do the taxes
for the Compton Evangelistic Episcopal
Baptist church of South Central.
You know,
I do just anything to help
Reverend Shack... tillfont.
- Just call 'im Shack.
- Shack.
Well, anyway I'll let you guys go.
I'll see you at choir rehearsal
on Thursday.
- Thursday.
- 7 o'clock, now!
Okay.
I'll escort Mrs., uh, Shacktill... font
to the elevator.
Gentlemen.
Uh, Peter,
we're really in a crunch.
I just got word that another firm's
in the running for the R&S account.
- We need to close this deal.
- Look...
I have no problem being
Peter's wingman on this one.
Oh, well, you know. Thanks anyway,
but I really have it under control.
So, you don't have to worry
about a thing, Ed.
Good. Then I'll expect you
to wrap it up in a day or two.
Well, that's the plan, certainly.
Ah.
Well...
Could you...
- Sure.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- She can't tee up her own ball?
I've been playing this game
for many years...
That's what it feels like.
... and it's all about patience.
- Well, you beat me by 19.
- Uh, let's make it 20.
All right.
Uh, Mrs. Arness, I was wondering
if you'd like to come over
to my house on Thursday
and, uh, possibly
look over the contract.
I'll have to check with
my secretary, Julia.
Mrs. Arness, would you...
would you excuse me for a minute?
I just have to
check on my children.
Oh, of course. You do that.
I'd like to dip you
in Cheez Whiz
and spread you over
a Ritz Cracker,
if I'm not being too subtle.
Boy, you are some kinda freaky.
Oh, you have no idea.
You got me
straight trippin', boo.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, what are you doing here?
What does it look like?
I'm on a date.
On a date.
She's... You're...
She's on a date? She-she's a felon.
- Hey.
- I'm not a felon.
- What is she doing here?
- Oh, get used to it, Twiggy.
You're gonna be seeing
a lot more o' me around here.
Not without a broom
in your hand.
If I have a broom, is only cause I'm here
to sweep up the white trash.
Save it for the YMCA, Jemima.
Bitch! I'm-a kick
the bulimia outta your ass!
Have-have you ever had
a tempered moment?
Why don't you go back to
the vodka bottle you crawled out of?
Mrs. Arness is here.
I am sheltering you.
I'm helping you.
Remember, I helped you...
All right! I'll let it ride.
All right. Thank you. Thank you for
letting it ride. That is wise and mature.
Now, just, you know,
get 'er walking. No, that way.
Let me show you the place,
Charlene.
Looking good, Lois!
Hey, freak boy...
I'm-a make myself
a little more luscious for you, okay?
I'll be right back.
Okay, precious.
What are you doin' in here?
I told you you was gonna be
seein' more o' me, right?
Look, I came here to warn you.
You keep disrespecting me,
and it's gonna get rough
around here.
Back off, Shaniqua.
You don't scare me.
You know what? That's it.
You must need a little
more eye shadow, right? Come on!
You've messed with
the wrong W.A.S.P., bitch.
Compliments of Tae-Bo,
two hours a day,
five days a week.
Compliments o' the hood,
24 hours a day, all my life.
You know, for a skinny white ho,
you're pretty tough.
And I don't ever wanna have
this conversation again!
"The girl had dou..."
"... ble..."
"... double D-cups."
There you go. You got it,
lil' man.
"I... put my mouth on her ni..."
- "... ples."
- What is that?
What are you doing
lettin' 'im read th...
He read. You read.
Georgey, you read.
I'm gonna kill you!
I am so proud of you.
I'm turning you in!
Pfft.
I found it in your drawer.
Well, I am a grown man
of 54... 41... 49 years old,
and he's 8, and what I read
in the privacy of my...
How'd you do it?
Oh, God,
I'm never gonna get this done.
Look,
the boy don't look carefully
at the details in a word,
so most o' the time,
he's just guessin'.
And what you gotta do
is just slow it down
and give 'im somethin'
stimulatin' to read.
Dad? What's a rack?
It's a country.
Well...
I was just doin' it
cause he was botherin' me.
Well, either way...
Can you get rid of this?
All right,
just put it back in my room,
cause I'll get rid of it,
cause I have a special job.
Come in!
It's girls' poker night
at the house.
Where's my little dealer?
Well, just wait right here, and I will just,
uh, I will just go get him.
- Georgey, Mrs. Kline is here!
- Hi, Mrs. Kline.
Come on, Georgey!
Tonight, I'm gonna
teach you to bluff.
And I think we need
to comb your hair differently.
You look like a fag.
- I'm not a fag!
- I didn't say you were.
- Hello.
- Hi. How are you?
Oh, good evening, sir. Hi. Uh...
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Dad, um, I don't want you
to freak out, okay?
- Why would I freak out?
- Well...
- Dad, this is Aaron.
- Hi.
- Hello.
- How do you do, sir?
I-I'm-I'm so glad
to actually meet you.
I-I-I told Sarah
that it was very important
that you feel comfortable
with me
taking.. her to
my, mh, parents' for dinner.
So, this is a date?
Oh, um, I'll have her home
by 11:00 at the latest, sir?
Yeah, I guess that'd be all right.
- All right. Did it work?
- Yeah, like a charm, my friend.
All right. Let's party.
Hey, hey, heey, watch the seats.
- All right...
- Oh, shut up.
No, I'm serious. It's leather.
Hm.
Well, look at you,
all growed up.
There's nothing to eat
in the house.
Yeah.
You comin' to a point?
Well, I'm hungry.
Are you?
- You askin' me out?
- Well, no, I'm not.
Yes... I am.
Okay.
Oh, look at the legs
on this wine.
I'm telling you,
this place is bangin'.
Don't you just mean,
"This is nice"?
Why the word "bangin"'
make you so uptight?
You know something? You're smart.
If you'd just deign to speak English
with what you learned
on the internet and in prison,
you could be
a paralegal tomorrow.
Please, like they gonna be beatin' down
my door to let me in school.
As a matter of fact, you're exactly
the kind of person they want.
Well, why would I wanna
do that, anyway?
I've been to your office.
Everybody's all uptight,
overworked,
tired, stressed-out,
don't see their family...
"Ooh, Ed is comin'."
"Ooh, Tobias."
I get a wedgie
just walkin' in your office.
Hey, it's what people do.
They work.
Look, all I'm sayin' is
I did the confinement thing.
For four years.
Now, if you're so concerned
with my future,
just help me clear my name.
I got it from there.
I got my own dreams,
my own goals.
Hey, give it to me.
Hey! What'd you do that for?!
- Cause you work too much.
- This is my phone!
That's probably why your wife
left your sorry ass.
Okay, Oprah, if you're so good
at relationships,
how come you don't
have a boyfriend?
I had one.
It's just I haven't seen
or heard from 'im
since I went in
four years ago.
Were you in love with 'im?
- Come on, let's go dance.
- Ha-ha-ha-ha... no.
Come on. When is
the last time you danced?
At my wedding.
Don't worry, I can dance.
It's just that I don't wanna.
Come on, smooth. Show me
what you're workin' with. Come on.
I can dance.
I just don't want to dance.
Man, you can't dance.
- Well, I got moves.
- Let me see.
All right, all right.
Okay, one last little drink here.
What, you gotta pee?
This was big in high school.
Man, look, you can't dance
from your brain.
You gotta feel it.
Now, come on.
Show me how
you made them kids.
- What the hell...
- How's this?
That's great for an epileptic.
Come on, now.
Come on, you gotta
move your pelvis with it.
Yeah, more hips.
There you go.
Get smooth with it.
Well, I'm sorry.
I-I can't help it, I do. I miss him.
Oh, snap out of it, already.
I'm snapped. I'm... snappy.
Oh, God, Ash.
I still can't believe
you were hit by a car.
Did you call a lawyer?
Oh, I can't talk to a lawyer.
I was jaywalking.
So, can we just stop...
- What?
- Oh, my God.
What?
Look at that!
Oh, my God, it's true. Look at that!
Look at that! Look at that!
He never danced
like that with me.
I'm gonna go talk to him.
- No! Sit!
- Why?
I can't tell you.
If I talk about it,
gangster people will come
to my house and cut me.
Oh.
Oh, he almost looks
like a fun person.
Must've been me.
Was it me?
No. Stop beating yourself up.
It's him.
Can we just
get outta here? Now?
You know what they say...
once you go black,
you never go back.
Can we get the check, please?
And that's why
I worked so hard,
so I could give Kate a good life,
then it backfired!
Man, bitches don't care
nothin' about that shit.
Oh, bitches do too care.
I'm gonna tell you a s-secret...
Sometimes I drive by our old house,
and I just look at it,
and I just remember our life,
and it just hurts!
Man, that is so pathetic,
P. Diddy.
But you know what?
I'm gonna help you get her back.
How?
Well, first,
we gotta create a mood.
Just like at the restaurant, baby.
I'm already there.
Yeah. Now, feel the Barry.
Feel Barry White.
Talk like Barry.
- Okay, that's Barry.
- Yeah.
This is Kate.
Hey, Kate. Yeah.
I want you to talk nasty to her!
Talk nasty!
I'd, uh, like to kiss you a lot.
Cut that sensitive shit,
Nancy Boy!
What?
- You gotta be a beast!
- A beast!
Yeah!
In the bedroom,
a woman wants a man
that knows how to ride her
when she bucks.
Ride 'em when she bucks!
Ride 'em!
It's just... I can't.
It's a sculpture. I just can't.
All right, okay.
Use me, then.
- Huh?
- Damn it, grab these.
- What?!
- Grab 'em!
Ohh!
Oh, I get it, yeah.
- Hey, Kate.
- Uh-huh.
Yeah, you've been waitin'
for this for a while, huh?
That's right. Now,
what you gonna do to 'er?
I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do!
I'm gonna give you a...
an aromatherapy massage
with incense! Mm!
No! Come on, now!
Wimps give aromatherapy massages!
Tell 'er again!
All right!
I'm gonna have...
sexual intercourse, baby!
No, you... you a beast!
You need some o' these.
- Yeah.
- Cojones grande!
Yeah! I'm gonna put 'em
in my pants!
- Get in there, boys!
- Now, grab 'em!
- Grab 'em.
- Grab 'em!
Yeah, hey, baby!
Now, what you gonna do?
What you gonna do?
Yeah, mama! You gonna be
my tawdry little woman?
Damn right!
Now get to humpin'!
- Ya-hoo!
- Whoa!
- How 'bout that, huh?!
- Yeah!
How would you like me
to pounce on you
- like a lion from above?
- I like it! I like it!
- Yo!
- That's what I'm talkin'!
You ain't.. you ain't just
no king o' the jungle,
you own that jungle!
That's your pride!
You own that jungle,
and ain't no one
gonna come around
and mess with your pride!
That's right!
I like that.
Yeah! You ain't ready
for that shit! Come on, now!
Be a beast! What you gonna do
when she starts ridin', huh?
- Take care of her!
- That's what I'm gonna do!
- Uh-huh! Uh-huh!
- You're mine, Kate!
- Ride that lighting rod!
- You don't need these no more.
You got your own!
You found your balls!
Yeah, I don't need those balls!
I got my own balls!
Mandingo!
What goes on in your personal life
is none of our business,
but if it begins to affect the firm,
we need to call attention to it.
Guys, we were moving a statue,
and we lost our footing,
and we fell.
My sister's under the impression
that you were
humping your nanny.
I was not humping my nanny!
Peter, surely you understand
that if Mrs. Arness
were to suspect any instability
on your part...
There is no instability
in my home.
You sure
you can trust this guy?
Well, hey,
he's helping me reopen my case.
Y'all got any leads?
Well, a still from
the bank surveillance camera
is on its way here,
and we found a deposition
that could help.
Well, that's cool, baby.
If there's anything
I can do to help,
anything... you just holler.
I gotta run.
Hey, Widow... If you meant
what you just said,
it's not gonna be an easy job.
I know it ain't.
I just gotta know
that if things get rough,
you're not gonna run out
on me.
I've been waitin'
four years for this.
I ain't gonna mess up.
Planning another heist?
No. Why would you say that?
I don't know.
Maybe it was hearing
the words "job" and "hot"
bandied between
two tattooed people?
Peter, that was just my old boyfriend
I told you about... Widow.
He's just tryin'
to get back with me.
Mm-hm.
I'm tellin' you the truth!
Look, I just didn't
want you to see 'im,
because... Widow, he... ain't been
the best boyfriend,
and... I knew
he'd be all over me.
Now you suddenly care
what I think?
No.
Maybe.
A little bit.
No more late visits?
Word.
Convicted felon's honor?
Innocent convicted felon's
honor.
Now, gimme some dap,
right there on the edge.
Right there, and then
come up here like that.
Pow, like that.
Hello?
<i>Dad!</i>
<i>Hey, sweetie.</i>
Is-is Charlene there?
Yeah, she's here.
You wanna talk to 'er?
- You okay?
- Yeah, I-I'm...
All right.
- Sarah?
- Girl talk.
Okay. What up, dawg?
I need you to come pick me up.
It's just I can't talk about it right now.
Where you at?
I'm on the corner
o-of Venice and Canal,
<i>and... there's a whole lot
of people out front.</i>
- Please don't tell my dad!
- All right.
No, just-just calm down.
I'm comin' to get you.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know who else to call.
It's cool. What's goin' on?
Hey, Sarah,
what have you been up to?
- Is that your boyfriend?
- No, he's not my boyfriend.
I liked his friend, Mike,
and we hung out a few times,
and he was always really nice,
but then... all he wanted
to do tonight was have sex,
I mean, he moved in
kind of rough, and...
He got rough with you?
Where he at?
He went back there
with that group.
Go wait downstairs.
Yo, Mike!
Please, don't kill me!
Oh, God!
What are you, crazy?!
Pull me up!
What do you want?!
Sarah!
Mike has somethin'
to say to you.
Say "sorry"!
I'm-I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
God, I am sorry!
Say "No means no".
No means no!
- She was where?!
- Calm down. It's just...
- She is 14!
- She's 15! Wait!
- G... well... oh!
- Look...
Sarah don't need a warden.
She needs her father...
you...
so you can't get mad. All right?
You do it, she'll never
tell you anything again.
All right.
I get it. I get it. I get it.
Just be cool. Just... just play it cool,
you know what I mean?
Just listen to her.
Let her do the talkin'.
- I am listening to you!
- Thank you.
Don't trip.
Don't trip.
So...
you went out with a boy...
and he took you to a party,
where kids were... drinking
and... trippin' on E...
and then he took you
up to a room
where he tried to...
get all up in that...
which he... didn't?
And then Charlene came...
in my new car...
and brought you home
after first...
bitchslapping him.
Well...
that was some night.
Oh, dad!
- I can't believe you're not killing me!
- No.
Oh! This is so great! I-I want
everything out in the open!
Oh, I have so much more
to tell you!
Kate,
what are you doing here?
W-what are you doing here?
It's my shortcut home
from work.
No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.
- Is not.
I thought
you were in the mountains.
Well, yeah,
I-I came back early.
There were bears
that were mauling the campers
and... eating them.
Wow.
But other than that, uh...
nothing went wrong with your...
Oh, no, no. He's great.
Yeah, I like 'im.
So, how's your...
My what?
Your life.
Anything... hip and new?
No.
Um...
I'm having a good time
with the kids, though.
Good. Glad you're having
fun with 'er.
Them.
What?
- You look, um...
- Yeah.
Rested.
Nice. You look nice.
So, uh, I guess I'll come by later
and pick up the kids.
Oh, uh... I was wondering if
I could keep 'em through Friday.
- Really? You're not too busy?
- No.
Well, yes, it's okay.
It's wonderful, Peter.
You know, if you wanted
to come ov...
- Go ahead.
- Sorry.
Hello?
<i>Yo, get your butt home, dawg.</i>
I will be home in
my own sweet time, girlfriend.
<i>You know, you gotta come now.
Arness said she on her way over here.</i>
Oh, I forgot all about that.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I-I ju... I have to go.
I just forgot
about something,
but... I wanna... I wanna continue
this conversation,
so, I will call you,
or you can call me on my cell.
- Bye!
- Uh-huh.
- Is she here yet?
- No!
The place is a mess!
We gotta clean this place up!
Hey, hey, hey, get upstairs
and get ready! C'mon!
And what are you reading?!
Get up there!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Hey, yo, P.,
while we got this minute...
- What minute?
- There's somethin' I really really
- been meanin' to tell you...
- Well, you'll have to wait.
Kids! She's here!
Mrs. Arness?
Oh!
Uh, I'll get right to the point,
Mr. Sanderson.
There are rumors circulating
that your... personal life
and your home are in disarray,
and this makes me feel
very unsettled.
Well, I don't know who misinformed you,
but please, come in.
I'd hate to think you're
under any misapprehension
about me or my family.
Sarah? Georgey?
You remember Mrs. Arness?
So lovely to see you again.
Um, father,
when you have a moment,
would you mind helping me
with my report on Queen Victoria?
Sure, kitten.
And don't forget, pop, tomorrow
you have to come to school
and help hand out the food
to the poor kids.
Have I ever forgotten
to help the poor kids?
No, pop. Never.
In truth, Mr. Sanderson,
you have a lovely home.
Thank you.
And your children
are very well-behaved.
They're angels.
Oh, William.
Oh, look!
He's even taken a fancy
to your boy.
That's so sweet.
Anyway, we can go to the den
and get the contracts...
What is that heavenly smell?
Ah, that would be, uh,
Charlene preparing dinner.
- Anyway, the contracts...
- You know...
I haven't smelled home cooking
like that since I was a child.
Really? Anyway...
Brings back
such happy memories.
Does it? Anyway, the... actually,
the den is closer...
Your table looks so inviting.
Yes. It's too bad it's so small.
Small?
Well, actually, it's big, isn't it?
It's a big table, so...
there would be room
for one more.
Oh, well, if it's not
an imposition...
Oh... oh.
Well, let me just go check
if there's enough... food.
I'm not... I'm not sure,
because, uh, actually,
this is the night of, uh,
uh, Yiminum, the, uh...
the holiday where
white people eat
very little portions
because that-that was the night
the Lord came down,
and He was... He was given food,
and there was just...
too much and He said "No".
And so, He had a smaller portion,
and that's-that's why
we might not have enough.
So, I'll just go check on, uh,
what the Lord would say.
Just one second.
Come here, William.
Hey, come here.
Are you hungry?
Charlene...
If there was ever a time
I needed a favor, it's now.
Okay, you got it, baby.
Anything.
Oh, thank you!
- Oh. Mrs. Arness?
- Yes, yes? Oh, yes.
My family and I are pleased
to invite you for dinner.
Yeah, oh.
Well, very well.
I wasn't expecting this.
Uh, but if you insist...
And then afterwards,
we can, uh, sign the contracts.
Of course.
Dinner is served.
I was raised
in the South, you know.
That smells just like
our Ivy's jambalaya.
She was so wonderful.
Uh, we paid her nothing,
of course, you know.
But, then, people had
standards of service in those days.
And, of course, Ivy did know
that you serve from the left
and collect from the right.
Don't...
stop at that story, because
I-I-I just love hearing about your past.
That is fascinating.
Oh, yes.
Well, anyway, as I was saying...
Yeah.
Yeah. Fast-actin'.
Fast-actin'.
Ooh, I'm gonna get you.
I'm gonna get you.
Uh-huh.
I'll serve your food right.
Was it the left?
Was it the right?
Father's work with
the Pasadena Republican Youth Group
has truly been invaluable.
I hope y'all brought y'all appetites.
Oh, yes.
I brought mine.
Oh, my goodness.
Uh, this is much too much for me.
I-I'll never get through all that.
Well, I have a little less here.
I'll trade with you.
Oh.
Good, thank you.
What, Charlene?
- Nothing, sir.
- Oh.
Oh, this food is...
Serves him right, anyway,
makin' me wear this stinkin' outfit.
You're very lucky to have found
such talented help.
Well, our Ivy was with us
for so long,
we really thought of her
as one of the family.
Mm.
And after every meal,
my mother would scrape
all the food we hadn't eaten
and put it on one big plate
and give it to Ivy.
Charlene,
what is that particular taste?
I.. it is tho... It's familiar, yet...
Is it some kind of...
herb like sage?
No, it's sort o' more
like a milk of mint.
Milk of... whatever it is,
the taste is explosive.
Mm!
Well, good, then.
Enjoy.
Oh, just one moment.
Uh, you know, uh,
there's a lovely,
sad Negro spiritual...
that Ivy's brother used...
Are you all right?
Anyway, Ivy's brother
used to sing this
when he came in
from the tobacco fields.
Now, there's a second verse
if you'd like to join
in the chorus.
That's... an unusual feeling.
Dad? Are you okay?
I hope your father's all right.
Does this happen often?
Well, if you'll excuse us. Um...
Georgey, let's go watch
that biography on Francis Drake.
We... I mean,
he... he seemed to be
so moved by that song.
Oh, he movin' all right.
<i>- We recap tonight's top story...
- William?</i>

Charlene Morton.</i>

on her left breast.</i>

<i>Good night and be safe.</i>
Mrs. Arness,
I can explain everything.
Pete, look. Before you lose it,
just let me explain.
- There's nothing to say.
- But I didn't do it, Pete.
You have to get out.
All right.
I'll get my stuff.
I don't understand.
You saw 'er and where is she?
I don't know where she is.
Don't drop the soap.
What the hell does that mean?
Well, I just don't believe this, Peter.
I'm worried about 'er.
I hate the fact
she's out there all alone.
Oh, you're worried about the poor,
innocent, frail creature
who can hardly take care
of herself on the street?
What about me?
Tobias is gonna fire me!
Oh, and another goodie.
If Arness calls the cops,
I could go to jail!
Here's the local number
for the Bureau.
The FBI takes harboring
a fugitive very seriously.
You, gentlemen, will be
the first to hear from me.
Arness didn't call the cops,
she called the FBI.
- Now, you haven't seen me.
- I have seen you.
No, I mean,
you haven't seen me.
I'm looking right at you, Peter.
What are you, what... Peter?
If you do hear from 'er,
please tell 'er... the cool points
are out the window and...
she's got me all twisted up
in the game.
Why you messin' with Lene?
I'm not messing with her,
I'm helping her.
Bullshit!
Ugh! Ugh! I'm telling you
the truth!
Listen up.
You do not reopen this case.
From now on,
I'm handlin' it for 'er.
I'm not gonna reopen the case.
The case is closed. Why would I reopen...
Stay out of 'er life.
If I gotta come back here,
things are gonna get bloody.
Maybe I should just finish this now.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
We have to find Charlene.
- I thought you hated Charlene.
- I found out she's innocent.
- I knew it. I.. I-I knew it.
- Where am I gonna find her?
Well, you can call 'er.
How can I call 'er
if I don't know where she is?
I gave her your phone,
in case you might...
My new cell phone? You gave her
my new 600-dollar titanium cell phone?
Good idea. Come on.
W-what happened to your head?
Metropolitan Museum of Art.
How may I help you?
I know who set you up.
What?! Who?
Get in.
So, what's up?
It's the guy points a gun
to my head
and tells me
not to reopen the case.
And I'm thinking
"Why is he doing this?"
And then it dawns on me...
it's because he was involved.
Goddamn him.
I can't believe
Widow did this to me.
- Where do you think he is?
- I don't know.
Probably downtown at this club
he hang out at, called the Down Low.
Gotta get a confession.
You can't go there.
Eh, man, I'm serious.
A white man at the Down Low
is either a cop, a corpse,
or a crackhead.
You can't even talk hood.
I'll figure out something.
Oh, and Howie told me
to tell you...
that "The cool points
are out the window,
and you got 'im
all twisted up in the game."
Really?
That's the nicest thing
anybody's ever said to me.
I'm gonna drop you off here
because I gotta get back
to the office, uh, for a conference call.
- So, I'll see you in a little bit.
- A'ight. Okay, cool.
Yeah, freak boy,
I need a ride.
Can you come now?
Damn. A straight, cold pimp.
Looks like Gendler beat us to 'er.
I can assure you, Mrs. Arness,
Peter Sanderson
is no longer affiliated
with Tobias, Kline, and Barnes.
Good.
- You have great ankles.
- What?!
Were you a dancer?
Yeah... well, yes. I was.
I bet you had great presence.
Whoo. How you two doin'?
I hope I'm not interruptin'
anything. You're nasty.
Yeah, w-what are you doing here?
Please, Mrs. Arness, I'm not here
to cause any trouble.
Well, that would be a first.
Julia? Julia?
Julia a little tied up
right now.
Please, I just need you
to hear me out for a minute.
Peter is not responsible
for any o' this. I am.
I mean,
the guy is a great lawyer.
And he's one of
the most decent men I've ever known.
- I doubt that's saying much.
- Shut up, fool.
Now, if only you knew
the lengths he's willing to go to
to help a friend.
That's what this whole thing...
Listen... sister...
"Sister"?
Why don't you go back
to Sanderson,
and the whole "Jungle Fever" thing
the two of you got goin' on,
before I call the cops?
That's it, pretty boy.
You ever met the big hurt?
The who?
I wouldn't do that
if I were you!
And why not?
You'll be instantly returned
to prison, where you belong.
All right. That's it.
How dare you?!
To hell with what I just said.
You obviously
one of them hard learners.
Howie?
This is my house! I will not
be told to do what I...
William.
I'm Kate Sanderson.
Have you seen my kids?
- Over there.
- Oh!
- Hey!
- Oh, God!
- What is going on?
- It's just the FBI, mom.
Yeah, they're just doing
a, like, search.
For what?
Well, for Charlene.
But she's not...
The FBI is looking
for your nanny?
Man, take your hands off me!
I said, back off me, punk!
That's what I mean.
You know what I'm sayin'?
You don't want none o' this, now.
Excuse me...
Homeboys...
Say, yo.
You got a bathroom in there?
Say, yo, what's the dealio?
Mm. Who's your daddy?
Back that booty up
and put it on the glass.
Anybody here
dig what I'm sayin'?
So...
your nanny was doing time...
for... armed robbery.
And then she broke out
of prison...
and then she came here.
But she's innocent...
and now your dad
has gone off to...
help 'er.
Sounds crazy, right?
He's not the same guy anymore.
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah, he's really cool.
Say, any o' you homies
holdin' extra Jimmy High?
Cause I'm all about crunchin'
some of that boofanny tonight.
If you harm one hair
on that dog's head...
Yeah, yeah, "Harm a hair on the head."
You got me all nervous.
Hello?
- Sarah?
- Oh, hey, Charlene.
Put your daddy on the phone.
No, he's not here.
He-he went out to find you.
He went to find me?!
Tsk. All right.
Howie, flip a "U".
We headed downtown.
Downtown's where I live,
precious.
No! No! Whoa, whoa!
What's on your mind, player?
What's with you? You been
drinkin' some o' that "Hatorade"?
What's up, Flavor?
Where you from?
From the hood
and misunderstood.
- How's your pimp hand, dog?
- Strong, baby, strong.
Can you swerve, snowman?
Do I got "honky"
spray-painted on my forehead?
Course I can.
I'm tryin' to peep a bowwow.
You so at home, man,
then dance with the woman.
I can't. I got b'ness.
Go on out there
and get your groove on.
No, I can't. I got important
b'ness to take care of.
Yeah.
I tell you, but...
You'll get a life sentence
for this.
You're a kidnapper
and a whore!
Hey.
Keep talkin', tea bag.
Ooh?! Tea bag!
Yeah, you'll be gummin'
your bubbles and squeak.
Yeah, oh! Terrible.
Damn, boy, you lookin'
all kinda stupid.
Really?
Cause I got this outfit
from your mama.
Yo, Eminem,
cut the wigger shit.
I don't think you know
how much trouble you in.
Fine, fine, fine.
I'm here to talk business...
private business.
What fresh air is this?
I don't see him anywhere.
I think he's in that back room
over there.
What do we do
with Her Majesty?
- Sit down.
- What?
Sit it on down.
Now, look. If you move,
your little Willy gonna
be bridged down. You dig?
- Dig.
- All right. Come on.
- Is that real?
- Oh.
Uh, Seven and Seven, double.
- How you doin'?
- What?!
I said, "How you doin'?".
Oh, fantastic.
You either the dumbest cracker
I ever met or you straight up...
Hold that thought.
I love this song.
Turn that off.
Get everybody up outta here.
I'm tellin' you,
he is definitely in there.
Okay, all right,
so he's in there,
and then you go in,
and then what happens?
Three seconds.
Why you here?
I got a feeling you're still sitting
on a hefty sum of stolen cash.
You wanna hide it,
you need a lawyer.
What's that?
What's with the phone?
- I'm calling in the cavalry.
- You'll go back to prison.
So, you wanna help me
launder my money?
I can hide it
in an untraceable account
in the Cayman Islands.
All I want is 100,000.
We both walk out o' here
wealthier men.
And... I tell you where
Charlene is... that simple.
You wearin' a wire?
Me? No. Are you?
And then... they kidnapped me.
And they took my dog,
William.
That's a damn shame.
Oh, you don't care.
You smokin', grandma?
Why not?
To hell with your proposition.
Hold it. Charlene is ready
to roll over on you.
She knows
who your accomplice was.
- Oh, that's pretty funny.
- I'm not kidding.
They're-they're out in the parking lot,
waiting for my signal...
and... and...
and the signal is...
if I don't come back,
they call the FBI.
There was no accomplice, fool.
There was a girl in the photo.
No, there was somebody
in a wig and a dress.
You...
You left her clothes,
the gun, and the money.
See?
You just too damn smart
for your own good.
- Look, we can't wait no more.
- Wait, wait. Charlene!
Open up.
Widow wanna see me.
- Says who?
- Says Lene.
Pete...
Well, ain't this a psychic moment?
I was just comin' to see you.
Come on, now, Widow. You know
this is between me and you.
Let him go.
No problem.
Ugh!
Oh, shit.
What... come on, now.
What are you doin'?
Ugh!
I got it.
Aim it, aim it, aim it,
aim it, Howie! Aim it!
- Yeah!
- Whoa!
Uh-huh!
Who got the gun now, huh?
Who got that gun now?
Homie, that's right.
Get y'all asses on the ground!
Asses on the ground
where I can see 'em, huh?
Take 'im out!
Pussies.
Ooh!
- Ugh!
- Ooh.
Ugh!
Wasn't that fun?
I'm just gonna... roll up
on outta here.
Thank you.
- Aah!
- FBI!
Everybody, freeze!
Charlene! Charlene!
Oh, baby!
Oh, oh, baby. Charlene...
Son of a...
Drop it!
Oh, Charlene.
- What?
- Damn, dawg.
Hey, Howie, she's all right.
Charlene...
I...
Do me a favor, precious.
Don't ever scare me
like that again,
or I'm gonna have to give you
a nasty spanking,
if I'm not being too subtle.
He's such a damn freak.
- Are you Sanderson?
- Yeah.
- Wait. Wait. She's innocent.
- Save it.
I can prove it.
Mr. Sanderson...
that was pretty ballsy.
You'd make a hell of an agent.
Oh, thank you very much,
but, gee, I don't think I did anything
- an ordinary man wouldn't do...
- Thanks again.
Mr. Sanderson...
There you are.
You have behaved abonidably.
Aboni...
Abomidably.
- Abodi...
- Abominably.
Yeah, I know.
- Shakespeare.
- Shakespeare.
No, wait. This is serious.
And I'll have you dis...
disboweled.
Uh, dis...balled.
Dis...
- Disbarred?
- Disbarred.
Oh, to hell with it.
I do believe I'm... stoned.
Just don't tell anybody
you ever saw me like this.
- Mrs. Arness...
- William.
Oh, God, you are
an ugly dog... and heavy.
- Here, I got 'im.
- Thank you.
Is there a 24-hour diner
around here?
- I know where one is.
- You do?
- I'll take you there.
- I'm dreadfully hungry.
- You guys okay?
- What do you think?
- Yo, be cool, G-mo.
- Yo, out back, G-mo.
Full cheesy, homey.
Well, that's not good enough.
You'll just have to keep
trying, won't you?
I called Arness four times
and she'll only talk to Peter.
Well, then, we're just gonna
have to keep 'im around, don't we?
Oh, hey, guys.
Peter.
Did I mention
I'm going out on my own?
You don't have the resources.
Well, I have... one
multibillion-dollar client.
It's a start.
- And a partner.
- I'm all over it, G.
Let's go.
Excuse me.
Peter,
we-we can talk about this.
Ed, you can
kiss my natural black ass.
Peter...
Ashley,
who are you doing here?
Oh, I was, uh, meeting,
uh, uh...
- for my aunt's estate. You know.
- About her aunt's estate.
There was a codicil.
Well, say goodbye
to half your stuff.
I'll... I'll call you.
Lookin' good, kids.
Almost there.
Uh, Peter, your 4 o'clock's waiting
for you in your office.
I don't have
any meetings today.
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
I had an appointment.
Hey.
So, this is how a big-time
tax attorney lives, huh?
This place is big pimpin',
P. Diddy.
- How you doin'?
- I'm a'ight.
I... I really wanted
to tell you again
how much I appreciate
what you did for me.
If I could only give you back
half of what you've given me.
Please. We'll call it even.
Now give me a hug.
- Hey, white people don't hug.
- You ain't white.
Well, I'm-I'm off-white.
Good to see you.
Kate...
Hi.
Um, oh, well, I'm, uh...
I gotta finish up
some things with Howie.
Oh, uh, Kate, this is Charlene.
Charlene, this is Kate.
Hi. You've... certainly been
shaking things up around here.
Well, shakin' is what I do best.
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Kate.
Thank you.
And... take care of 'im for me.
Hi.
Hi.
So...
what...
what brings you down?
I mean, you know,
not what brings you down,
but, I mean,
what... brings you down here?
Well, I was
just wondering, um...
how often do you take
that shortcut past my house?
Technically?
Uh, well...
uh, pretty much every day.
Well, you know...
technically...
that's stalking.
It's kinda cute.
Kate...
There's something
I wanna say to you.
The... the cool points
are out the window,
and I'm all twisted up
in the game.
- What does that mean?
- It means I love you.
Rastaman, hold still,
or you're gonna have
these Jamaican beads
all over the floor.
Mm, yeah.
All right, halfway done.
What you think?
Holler at your boy.
- Hey.
- Nothin' is nothin'.
Who's your daddy now?
Boy, you are some kinda freaky.
