Man: Dr. Barrett?
Morning.
My people tell me
you're one of the best five
in your field.
Your fee will be Â£100,000.
Your assignment--
to establish the facts.
-Regarding what?
-Survival after death.
You want me--
To let me know if it's factual.
How could l convince you
either way?
Give me the facts.
Where can l find these facts?
l'm a physicist.
ln the 20 years l've studied
parapsychology, l've yet--
lf they exist, you'll find them
in the only place
l know on earth
where survival
has yet to be refuted.
The Belasco house.
Hell House?
Hell House.
But l thought the Belasco family
had it sealed up
after what happened.
That was 20 years ago.
They need money now.
l bought the place.
Can you be there by Monday?
Well, can you?
Yes.
There will be two others
with you.
A medium called
Florence Tanner--
Tanner?
But she's a mental medium.
As l want that line of approach
employed as well as yours.
But she's practically a child.
My people tell me
she's the best in her field too.
And the other one?
The...the only survivor
from the last attempt.
-Fischer?
-Yeah, Fischer.
Between the three of you,
l expect an answer
within a week.
A week?
Take it or leave it.
Well, this is a complete list
of all phenomena
recorded at the Belasco house,
restoration of electricity,
transportation
of your equipment.
-ls that it?
-No, there's a certain machine
which is only partly constructed
at the moment.
How long will it take
to complete?
That depends on how many
electronics experts
you put on the job.
How soon will you need it?
No later than Wednesday.
Good day.
You know,
l think it would be better
if you didn't come along
on this trip.
But l always come with you.
l don't want to be left alone.
Besides, l want to be there
when you prove your new theory.
lsn't it just another
so-called haunted house?
lt's the Mt. Everest
of haunted houses.
There were two attempts
to investigate it.
Both were disasters.
Eight people died.
Fischer was the only one
who survived.
And when he crawled out,
he was a mental wreck.
Man: These are the keys
to the house.
Your luggage and equipment
has already been installed,
the electricity's on,
your rooms are ready,
and there's a full larder.
l'll call back for you
at 5:00 on the 24th.
Woman: Look at the windows.
Fischer: He had them bricked up
so no one could see in.
Woman 2: Or out.
lt's hideous.
We're not even inside yet,
Miss Tanner.
l don't have to be.
(Lock turns)
(Light switch clicking)
Dr. Barrett: So much for
the restored electricity.
They work off a generator,
don't they?
Fischer: Yes.
Mrs. Barrett:
My God, the smell!
The atmosphere in here...
Of this world, not of the next.
This house...
it knows we're here.
Miss Tanner?
Sorry, l'll keep my observations
to myself.
Do you know where
the emergency generator is?
l hope l didn't disturb you.
lt's just that
l'm concerned for you
coming into this pesthole.
Yes, l understand.
l wonder if you do.
Just how wealthy
was Mr. Belasco?
l believe he left millions
when he died.
Died?
lf there's anything
you care to tell us...
What's to tell?
The house tried to kill me.
lt almost succeeded.
Now, that leads to the cellars,
doesn't it, Mr. Fischer?
That's right.
What's through there?
Fischer: The chapel.
Chapel?
(Woman groaning faintly)
Sorry, l can't right now.
We understand.
Man (faintly):
Welcome to my house.
l'm delighted you could come.
l'm certain you'll find your
stay here most illuminating.
(Woman crying faintly)
Think of me as your
unseen host and believe...
Why couldn't Miss Tanner
come in?
Her system is attuned
to psychic energy.
Obviously,
it's very strong in here.
A church in hell.
That sort of thing.
Why doesn't it affect him?
Obviously,
he knows how to protect himself
better than she does.
(Flashlight clicks)
Miss Tanner?
l'm sure it's nothing.
Are you?
Miss Tanner?
Miss Tanner: l'm over here.
You shouldn't have done that,
Miss Tanner.
You caused us undue alarm.
l'm very sorry.
l heard a voice in here.
Man (on record):
Welcome to my house.
l'm delighted you could come.
l'm certain you'll find your
stay here most illuminating.
Think of me as your unseen host
and believe that
during your stay here
l shall be with you in spirit.
May you find
the answer that you seek.
lt is here, l promise you.
And now, auf wiedersehen.
Auf wiedersehen.
Till we meet again.
The record wasn't meant for us.
What made the record go on
by itself?
Belasco said he could
will people
to a particular object
then move among them unobserved.
l doubt that.
Do you?
Our attention was on that
a few moments ago.
How do you know
he didn't walk right by us?
(Whoosh)
Well, this house certainly
hasn't lived up
to its reputation so far.
lt hasn't taken our measure yet.
l think we'd be wrong
in considering the house
is the haunting force.
Quite evidently,
the problem is created
by multiple surviving
personalities.
l take it that you still
don't believe in survival,
Dr. Barrett.
lf by that you mean
surviving personalities,
you're quite correct.
We will see.
lndeed we shall, Miss Tanner.
When was the house built?
l don't know.
Mr. Fischer?
1919.
l get the impression that you
know quite a bit about Belasco.
Would you mind sharing it
with us?
(Sets cup down)
His first name was Emeric.
He was born
on March the 23rd, 1879.
He was the illegitimate son
of an American munitions maker.
What did he look like?
His was a frightening visage.
Like the face of a demon
that had taken on
some human aspect.
-Are you quoting?
-Yes, l am.
That is his second wife.
She committed suicide
in this room in 1927.
How tall was he?
Uh...he was 6'5".
They called him
the Roaring Giant.
What did he do to make this
house so evil, Mr. Fischer?
Drug addiction,
alcoholism, sadism,
bestiality, mutilation,
murder, vampirism,
necrophilia, cannibalism.
Not to mention a gamut
of sexual goodies.
Shall l go on?
How did it end?
lf it had ended,
we would not be here.
lt's about to end, Mr. Fischer.
(Scoffs)
What happened to Mr. Belasco?
No one knows.
When relatives of the guests
had this house broken into
in 1929,
they found all of them dead
from one cause or another.
Twenty-seven in all.
Belasco was not among them.
lf no one objects, l'd like
to try a sitting tonight.
l have no objection.
Would you care to sit
in the morning, Mr. Fischer?
l'm not ready yet.
Miss Tanner: ln the spirit
of love and tenderness
we've gathered here tonight
to communicate with those
who walk this house in torment.
Help us to bridge the chasm
of death so faithfully
that pain is transformed
into joy,
sorrow into peace.
All this we ask in the name
of our infinite Father. Amen.
(Whoosh)
(Breathing heavily)
This is an evil house.
A place of sickness.
Evil.
Extremes.
Limits.
Terminations and extremities.
l don't know.
lf thine eye offend thee...
Yes.
There is a young man,
very young...
says he must speak.
Must speak.
(Exhales)
(Whoosh)
(Affected voice)
l don't know you people.
Why are you here?
lt does no good.
Nothing changes.
Nothing.
Get out or l'll hurt you.
l can't help myself.
Goddamn you, you filthy sons
of bitches! Goddamn you!
l don't want to hurt you...
but l must. l must!
Get out of this house
before l kill you all!
(Whooshing)
(Silence)
(Sighs)
You started manifesting
physical phenomena.
But l'm not a physical medium.
You were just now.
The embryo of one, at any rate.
l don't understand.
All this time a mental medium,
and now this.
The Lord certainly does move
in mysterious ways.
So does this house.
Back to normal?
Those pounding noises
are a bit unnerving
the first time you hear them.
Why was Miss Tanner so disturbed
by that sitting?
Because she caused
physical phenomena.
But if Miss Tanner
is a mental medium
and Mr. Fischer
is a physical medium,
then how can you be so sure
that Miss Tanner created
those noises, and not Fischer?
l can't.
ln fact, l'm not at all sure
about Mr. Fischer...
or Miss Tanner.
(Whoosh)
Who is it, please?
(Whoosh)
You want to speak to me?
(Whoosh)
Are you the one
that warned us to get out?
(Whoosh)
Yes, it is you, isn't it?
You must give me some sign.
(Whoosh)
You're not Belasco, are you?
Such a pain would not be
in Belasco.
l feel your anguish.
Who are you?
(Whoosh)
Daniel?
Daniel Belasco?
(Whooshing stops)
Very clever.
lf you're that clever,
why are you still
a prisoner in this house?
(Whoosh, muffled voice)
(Silence)
Miss Tanner: Good morning.
Dr. Barrett : Good morning.
-You slept well?
-Fine.
And you?
Yes, very well, indeed.
Thank you.
l think l have a partial answer
to the haunting, doctor.
-Do you?
-Hmm.
That young man that warned us
during the sitting,
he came to my room last night.
He's Belasco's son.
Yes. Daniel. Daniel Belasco.
He's very young
and very frightened.
And because he's so frightened,
he's very angry, very hostile.
l believe if l can convince him
to move on,
a great portion of the haunting
force will be eliminated.
Do so, by all means.
l'd like to suggest
another sitting.
Under scientific conditions
this time.
Dr. Barrett:
Miss Tanner in apparent trance.
Pulse rate 85, respiration 15.
Four electric contacts
maintained.
No change in temperature.
Steady at 73.2 degrees.
Dynamometer reading
decreased to 1-8-2-3 now.
Temperature lowering.
Now at 69.6 degrees.
Pulse rate 94.5 and rising.
Temperature drop
now 12.3 degrees.
Dynamometer reading
reduced to 1-7-7-9.
Pressurometer negative.
Electric contacts
still maintained.
Rate of breath increasing.
Fifty.
Fifty-seven.
Sixty.
Rising steadily.
(Machine clicking)
lnfrared rays broken.
Cameras activated.
Evidence of electromagnetic
radiation commencing.
Medium's respiration, 210.
Dynamometer, 1-4-6-0.
Temperature...
Evidence of ozone in the air.
(Whoosh)
Ectoplasm forming.
Separate filaments exuding
from fingertips of both hands,
uniting to form
two separate strands.
Two strands moving
toward each other.
Ectoplasmic stalk through net,
moving toward table.
Leave a sample in the jar,
please.
Aah!
Hold it!
She's all right.
Miss Tanner
coming out of trance.
Premature retraction
of ectoplasm
causing brief systemic shock.
Conclusion of sitting--
2:48 p.m.
l spoiled your sitting,
didn't l?
Dr. Barrett: Not at all.
l couldn't be more satisfied.
Take a look.
What is it?
A specimen of that teleplasm
prepared in water.
What spiritualists refer to
as ectoplasm
is derived almost entirely
from the medium's body.
The remainder being
a mixture from the air,
the medium's costume,
fibrous remains,
food and dust particles,
et cetera, et cetera.
But the bulk of it is organic,
living matter.
An organic externalization
of thought.
Mind reduced to matter.
You mean, she made that figure
from herself?
(Whooshing)
(Silence)
(Footsteps)
l was visited by Belasco's son
again this afternoon.
Were you?
Will it never end?
Will what never end?
This attitude of yours
of doubt and distrust.
-Distrust?
-Yes!
Why should mediums be expected
to perform
only under conditions
that science dictates?
We're not machines.
We're human beings.
What brought this on--
l'm not a medium
for the fun of it, you know.
lt's often painful,
often unrewarding.
Do you think that l don't--
lt just so happens
that l believe mediumship
is God's manifestation in man.
When l speak to thee,
l will open thy mouth
and thou shalt say unto thee,
"Thus saith the Lord."
Miss Tanner...
l'll have you know that
there's nothing in the Bible--
not one single recorded
phenomenon--
that did not occur today.
Be it sights or sounds,
shaking of the house,
coming through closed doors,
rushing winds, levitations,
automatic writing
or the speaking in tongues!
Miss Tanner...
l haven't the slightest idea
what this is about, but--
Ah!
(Gasps)
No!
Aah!
No!
Mr. Fischer, you must go.
What the hell
are you talking about?
You know what l'm talking about.
You're the physical medium.
You're obviously being used.
You're not in control.
You've got to get out of here.
Doctor.
Trying to get rid of us
both now?
Miss Tanner:
What do you mean?
Doctor, what do you mean?
l would've thought
that was obvious, Miss Tanner!
What is he saying?
That l'm responsible?
You're the one
who should leave this house.
You're the one who's being used,
not me.
Mrs. Barrett:
Do we have to stay?
Dr. Barrett:
Are you serious?
You know how important
this is to me.
And what if you're hurt again?
-l won't be.
-How do you know?
l'll see to it!
Surely you noticed how it all
ended with a word from her.
How l was the only one
who was attacked.
l was the one who angered her.
You mean, you think Miss Tanner
was responsible for all that?
Not unassisted.
There's a lot of power
in this house, Ann.
She was the one
who used it though.
Directed it at me.
l made a mistake.
l accepted quiet,
polite behavior toward me
at face value.
Well, you can't do that!
Not with a medium.
You never know
what's underneath.
(Knocking at door)
May l speak to you?
l'll only be a moment.
Are you badly hurt?
l'll manage.
l know what happened now,
doctor.
lt was Belasco's son.
Well, don't you see
he's trying to separate us?
We're less of a challenge to him
that way.
l'll sit for you in the morning.
There'll be no further sittings.
But you can't stop them now.
l'm doing so.
You don't think it was me
who did all that, do you?
l not only think it, l know it!
Now, please,
l'm in considerable pain.
Doctor, l am not responsible.
lt was Belasco's son!
Miss Tanner!
There is no such person.
You're wrong.
Lionel?
(Sighs)
(Woman moaning, faintly)
Lionel.
Lionel!
(Moaning stops)
Where are you going now?
To look for something.
Proof that Belasco's son
existed?
l'm sorry
if l insulted you before.
Mrs. Barrett.
Mrs. Barrett!
You...
me...
that girl...
Lionel...
all together.
Naked.
Drunk.
Clutching.
Sweating.
Biting!
Aah!
You...
You were walking in your sleep.
Mrs. Barrett!
(Faint whooshing)
(Muffled cries)
(Crying continues)
(Silence)
Daniel, l've found you.
(Rattling)
Aah! Aah!
(Miss Tanner screaming)
What is it? What happened?
Daniel Belasco, l found him.
Well, l'm not imagining it.
He attacked me.
Did l imagine this?
He's in there, behind the wall.
Miss Tanner:
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
Oh Lord,
we beseech thee mercifully
to receive the prayers
of thy people
which call upon thee...
(Continues indistinctly)
Man (faintly): Florence.
ls that you?
Man: Help me, Florence. Help me.
Why?
You should have gone on.
Man: You are my only hope.
Your body was buried.
l prayed for you.
Man: Please.
No. You have to go.
You've been given your release.
Man: You are my only hope.
-You must go on.
-Florence...
What is it you want?
-Man: Make love to me.
-No.
No, l can't.
Man: Florence.
No, l can't.
No!
(Door creaks)
(Hisses)
What in the name of God?
-Aah!
-(Cat screeches)
(Screeching continues)
-(Screeches)
-Aah!
(Hisses)
Aah!
(Screeches)
(Screaming, screeching)
(Cat screeches, thud)
Man (faintly): Florence. Please.
(Engine starts)
Doctor,
Miss Tanner's been hurt again.
Where is she?
She's in her room.
She's been bitten.
She's been scratched.
How did it happen?
l don't know. A cat, l think.
A cat?
lt was possessed
by Daniel Belasco.
Would you like me
to examine you?
Use this.
lt'll prevent infection.
l'm all right.
l know you think--
lt doesn't matter what l think.
What matters is
your being mauled.
l said l'm all right.
l wonder if that is so.
Wouldn't it be advisable
for you to leave?
No, l'm not leaving now!
lt's up to you of course.
But l think
l'd be failing in my duty
if l didn't warn you to leave.
l don't want you to be
another victim of Hell House.
He's right, you know.
You should leave.
Ben.
You are being torn to pieces.
You don't think l'm doing this
to myself, do you?
Oh, no, of course l don't.
l don't know
who is doing it either.
You say it's Daniel Belasco,
but what if you're wrong?
What if you're being fooled?
Fooled?
But Daniel Belasco does exist.
We found his body.
We also laid him to rest.
So why is he not at rest?
l think l know, Ben.
Controlled multiple haunting,
something absolutely unique
in haunted houses.
A surviving will so powerful
that he can use that power
to dominate
all other surviving souÂ¤es.
You mean Emeric Belasco?
He's the one that's kept me
from the chapel.
He's the one that made it seem
as if Daniel possessed the cat.
He caused the poltergeist attack
against Dr. Barrett.
He's also the one that's keeping
Daniel's soul imprisoned here.
He's like a general
with his army.
Never entering the battle
but always controlling it.
Just what have you been doing,
Mr. Fischer?
Hmm?
Have you been drinking?
l don't think
that's any of your business.
Although l do think
it's a very good idea.
Come on.
No. You come on.
Mrs. Barrett?
Yes, Ben?
You should not leave
your husband alone.
Oh, l think he's all right.
He's sleeping.
Mrs. Barrett,
you must go back upstairs.
Did you know this was
where it all happened?
Where all what happened?
All that debauchery...
and vice.
Right here.
Right around this very table.
Mrs. Barrett, you don't know
what you're saying.
Oh, yes, l do.
l know exactly what l'm saying,
Mr. Fischer.
Mr. B.F. Fischer.
Mrs. Barrett, it's this house.
lt's making you--
This house isn't doing anything.
l'm doing it.
Touch me.
Touch me,
or l'll find somebody who will!
No! No!
(Groaning)
l know you won't forgive me...
now. l...
l know what l did.
l'd give anything to undo it.
l just don't know
why l went down those stairs.
l knew what l was doing--
l--l knew.
But at the same time, l--
l'm not asking you
to forgive me,
but please,
please don't hate me.
l need you. l love you.
l just don't understand
what's happening to me.
l just don't understand.
lt's all right.
lt'll pass
after we've left this house.
l love you too.
(Mrs. Barrett sobbing)
Doctor, l think your wife
is in grave danger.
-What happened here--
-Mr. Fischer.
-lt was not her fault.
-Please, Mr. Fischer.
Doctor, this is a matter
of life and death.
What you saw here today
is not the first occurrence.
Did you know that she walked
down here last night?
When?
Near midnight.
You were asleep. So was she.
She walked in her sleep?
Yes.
You should've told me.
No, doctor, she should have.
The fact that she didn't--
Doctor, l don't think you know
what is going on in this house.
What l think is irrelevant
to this conversation--
lrrelevant? What the hell
do you mean by irrelevant?
Whatever it is that's getting
at your wife
has already gotten
to Miss Tanner and to you.
Or perhaps you haven't noticed.
l've noticed quite a number
of things, Mr. Fischer.
One of which is
that you're blocking
yourself off completely.
And another things is
Mr. Deutsch is obviously
wasting a third of his money.
(Sighs)
Dr. Barrett: One of which
is that you're blocking
yourself off completely.
Blocking yourself off
completely.
(Thinking)
l am not blocking anything.
l'm just not sticking my neck
out the way l did in 1953.
(Screaming)
(Gagging)
(Knocking at door)
-Ben, l've been thinking--
-Give up.
Give up?
What's happened?
l thought we trusted each other.
l don't trust anyone...
or anything.
And anyone who does
in this house is a fool.
Something has happened.
Lots of things.
Nothing we can't handle.
Wrong.
There is nothing in this house
that we can handle.
That's not true.
We've made wonderful progress.
Toward what?
Our graves?
Well, Daniel, for instance,
and the way that Belasco works.
Daniel!
Daniel, Daniel, Daniel! Heh.
Daniel! How do you know
he ever even existed?
The body, Ben.
ls that your proof?
How do you know you haven't been
deluding yourself?
How do you know he isn't just
a figment of your imagination?
How do you know his personality
isn't exactly
what you made of it?
-How do you know?
-l just know l'm right!
Yes, and we all knew
we were right in 1953 too.
Heh-heh.
Grace Lauter,
a successful medium for...
for 20 years.
She jumped off the balcony...
and she shattered both her legs.
Dr. Graham...
physicist.
He crawled out of this house
to die.
Professor Rand...
head of the chemistry department
at the University of Oxford.
Paralyzed.
Professor Fenley...
a psychic investigator.
Crippled and insane to this day.
Yes, eh...
you're right.
l am obstructing.
You're quite right.
l'm shut off.
l'm going to stay shut off
until l am far away
from this place.
l am going to collect
my 100,000,
and l am never going to come
within 1,000 miles of this house
for as long as l live.
And l suggest you do the same.
Ben.
(Liquid gushing)
(Gasps)
(Screams)
ls there anything l can do
to help?
l'm afraid not.
lt's just too complicated.
Thanks all the same.
What's it going to do, Lionel?
You've heard me talk
about the power in this house.
lt's a real power, Ann.
A field of measurable energy.
Energy that can be reversed.
And that's exactly
what l'm going to do.
By this time tomorrow,
Hell House will be drained.
De-energized.
You'll see.
(Clapping)
That pile ofjunk
you have there, Barrett,
it isn't gonna do a thing.
Get her out of here.
Get out yourself.
You haven't got a chance.
Have you?
Yes.
Yes, l know the score.
You do not fight this house!
Look, Hell House doesn't mind
a guest or two.
What it doesn't like
is people who attack it.
Belasco doesn't like it.
His people--they don't like it.
And they will fight back,
and they kill you.
So you listen to me.
You just leave
that damn machine alone
and you spend the rest of
the week resting, doing nothing.
When Sunday comes,
you tell Deutsch
anything he wants to hear
and bank the money.
lf you try anything else,
you will be a dead man
with a dead wife at your side.
He won't listen, will he?
l was the only one
to make it out of here
alive and sane in 1953.
And l will be the only one
to make it out of here
alive and sane this time.
He's wrong.
l told you before,
Florence Tanner is wrong
in what she believes.
l'm telling you now
that Fischer is equally wrong.
Tomorrow it will be proved.
(Whooshing)
Man (faintly): Help me.
Please.
Please, help me.
(Ghoulish screaming)
Man (echoing):
Help me, Florence. Help me.
(Overlapping voices)
You're my only hope.
(Overlapping voices continue)
(Whoosh)
Daniel, you must understand.
What you ask is impossible.
l can't.
l believe in you.
l've opened my heart to you.
(Voice muttering)
Man: Florence,
love me.
No. No!
Man: Help me, Florence.
Help me.
Dear God,
reach down your hand
and give me your protection.
Help me this night
to bring to you
the tortured soul
of Daniel Belasco.
l give you now
the love you've never known.
l give it freely so that
you'll gain
the strength to go on
from this house.
Man: l love you.
And l love you.
With love. Please, with love.
(Gasps)
Man: Florence...
Aah!
(Giggles)
Florence.
How long have you been here?
All night.
There?
Stupid.
You could've slept with me.
Who put on my nightdress?
Mrs. Barrett.
Why didn't you do it?
My God, he's inside me!
He lied to me.
He said it was the only way.
But he's inside me!
Even as l'm speaking to you
l--l can feel him just
waiting in there to take over!
lt's going to be all right.
l'm going to take you
out of here this morning.
No, he won't let me go.
He can't stop you.
-Yes, he can.
-Well, he can't stop me.
(Affected voice) Who the hell do
you think you are, you bastard?
You might've been hot stuff
when you were 15,
but now you're shit.
Hear me? Shit!
Dear God, help me.
(Sobbing)
l'm taking her away.
-How are you, Miss Tanner?
-l'm all right.
You needn't come back if you
don't want to, Mr. Fischer.
For this afternoon
the house will be clear.
Clear? How?
There isn't time
for explanation.
Yes, there is.
l'm not leaving until l know.
Florence.
l am not leaving until l know!
Right.
The body emits a form of energy
invisible to the human eye.
This energy can be expanded
far beyond the confines
of the body,
where it can create mechanical,
chemical, physical effects.
Sounds, the movement of objects
and the like
such as we've experienced.
Now the energy l talk about
is a field of
electromagnetic radiation.
-EMR.
-Exactly.
All living organisms emit
this energy.
Such power must saturate
its environment.
ls it any wonder then that
Hell House is the way it is?
Consider the destructive mental
and physical residual energy
which has been poured into
its interior.
ln essence,
the house is a giant battery
the residual energy of which
must inevitably be tapped
-by those who enter it.
-But can't you see
this energy is what
we survive with after death?
No, Miss Tanner,
the residue l speak of
has nothing to do
with surviving personalities.
The spirit of Emeric Belasco
does not prowl this house.
Neither does his son
or any of the other entities
that you believe yourself
to be in contact with.
No.
There is one thing and one thing
only in this house--
mindless, directionless power.
You're wrong, Dr. Barrett.
You're so wrong.
You cannot destroy a spirit.
All you will do is send it
from one hell to another.
No, Miss Tanner.
l'm right.
This afternoon,
my machine will fill the house
with a massive countercharge
of electromagnetic radiation
which will oppose
the polarity of the atmosphere,
reverse, and dissipate it.
And Hell House will be
exorcized.
l see.
Well, there's nothing else
to do then, is there?
Barrett.
(Metal clatters)
Aah!
Dr. Barrett: Thank God
she didn't know what to smash.
l should be flattered, really.
Her attack on the reverser
was her ultimate tribute to it.
She knows l'm right.
There was nothing else to do.
That's what she said.
She had to destroy my beliefs
before they could destroy hers.
(Footsteps)
Daniel?
(Whoosh, whir)
(Faint sobbing)
(Ghoulish screaming, wailing)
Man: Florence.
Daniel, you must leave
before it's too late.
Soon you'll be sent
from this hell to another.
(Rattle, creaking)
Aah!
Where is Miss Tanner?
She was lying over there
a few minutes ago.
Why didn't you watch her?
(Groaning)
(Whoosh)
You tricked me.
God help me, you tricked us all.
(Ghoulish laughter)
(Grunting)
(Gasps)
Quickly.
(Machine whirring)
(Whirring grows louder)
(Ghoulish wailing)
(Silence)
You'll have to open yourself
to it, Mr. Fischer.
Try, Mr. Fischer.
l guarantee
there'll be no trouble.
Well?
He's startled because
there's nothing to pick up.
ls it really over, Lionel?
Yes, it's over.
Done with. Finished.
Miss Barrett:
l can't believe it.
l know.
Do you mind
if l say l told you so?
What a pity Miss Tanner
had to die
when the answer was so close.
Fischer: Barrett.
Barrett, the house is clear!
lt is completely clear!
And l called that machine
a pile ofjunk!
Jesus God, a pile ofjunk.
You better go and get some rest.
l want to check my readings.
l didn't have a chance before.
(Clicking)
(Beeping)
(Rattling)
(Beeping continues)
This is impossible.
l don't accept this.
l do not accept this!
Lionel?
Dr. Barrett (faintly):
ln here.
Lionel?
Dr. Barrett: Here.
Aah!
(Whooshing)
Mr. Fischer:
l'm sorry.
Lionel...
Please get me out of here.
Please.
l'm not leaving.
l'm going back to the chapel.
No. No, you can't.
You don't know
what it's like in there.
l have to.
No, you don't.
There's no reason
to go back there.
None.
Ann, listen.
l have to.
lt's for Florence.
lt's for your husband.
lf l leave Hell House now
my whole life is going
to be a failure.
You can't solve it.
lt cannot be solved.
You're gonna die...
like Lionel...
like Miss Tanner.
Then l will.
Mr. Fischer: lt's here.
The entire house is clear
except for this one place.
But why?
Why?
Belasco.
(Exhales)
That's what the B
inside the circle means.
She was trying to tell us
that it was only Belasco
all along.
lt isn't mindless,
directionless power.
lt isn't multiple hauntings.
lt's only one.
One entity pretending
to be Daniel.
One entity pretending
to be many others.
That's where the answer lies!
But what's the key?
What is the key?
Miss Tanner:
Extremes and limits.
Terminations and extremities.
Oh, God.
Of course,
that's what she meant.
Extremes.
Limits.
Legs!
Grace Lauter's spine and legs
shattered.
Dr. Graham, crawling.
Professor Rand, paralyzed.
Professor Fenley, crippled.
Florence's legs, crushed.
Your husband's--
Miss Tanner:
lf thine eye offend thee...
Oh, yes, yes, yes!
Belasco!
Whatever you do
do not interfere.
Belasco.
Here l am.
Destroy me if you can!
Don't leave the job half done!
We're here!
l'm here!
Kill me!
(Metal rattling)
No!
That's it.
Oh!
That's it.
Tell me something, Belasco.
Why didn't you ever leave
this house when you were alive?
Why,
did you despise the sunlight?
Was it better hiding
in the shadows?
(Panting)
No one--
no one could really
see you then, could they?
No one could find out
your secret then, could they?
You weren't a genius!
You were a deviant!
A sawed-off little ba...stard!
(Whooshing)
Your mother was a bitch!
A whore!
You were a bastard!
(Snap)
A funny,
little dried-up bastard!
You're no genius!
You're no roaring giant!
(Snap)
What size were you, Belasco?
Five foot two?
One?
l know!
You weren't even five foot tall!
(Man screams)
Emeric Belasco.
The roaring giant.
ls it clear?
(Grunting)
Ah.
(Gasps)
This is a special moment.
Meet Emeric Belasco.
No, your husband really did have
part of the answer.
And Florence had part of it too.
And with her help
l finally found the last part,
that which Belasco's giant ego
could not face.
(Gasps)
He so despised his own shortness
that he had
both his legs cut off
and wore those instead
to give himself height.
lf thine eye offend thee,
pluck it out.
Maybe he was a genius after all.
Just because a man decides
to preserve his body after death
doesn't make him a genius.
lt's not his body
of which l'm speaking.
This is why
your husband's machine
could not destroy his power.
These walls are sheathed
with lead.
He built himself a fortress
to protect his spirit.
He knew what was coming
years before it came.
(Whirring)
Your husband and Florence helped
us to rid this house of Belasco.
Let us hope that their spirits
guide him to everlasting peace.
(Whirring continues)
Miss Tanner (whispering):
Belasco.
