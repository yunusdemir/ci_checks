You know, you are going to love it here.
My great-grandmother was class of 1903.
<i>So, I'm fourth generation
to go here.</i>
Both my mom and dad are
on the Board ofTrustees.
So, obviously, we believe that
Miss Godard's is the fi! Nest
girls' school in the East.
This is Miss Godard,
who founded the school.
- She looks like an ax murderer.
- <i>Indeed, you will fiind...</i>
the original ax on display
at the woodpile.
- [Laughs] Hello, Miss McVane.
- Hello, Abby.
Kindly explain my joke
to the new girl.
Well, one of the rules is if you're late
to class, you have to <i>chop</i> wood.
You must be Odette Sinclair.
Welcome.
I know it's a diffi! Cult adjustment
from a coed academy to a girls' school.
If I can <i>help</i> ease the transition,
come see me in my offi! Ce.
Carry on, Abby.
Who was that?
Zorro?
Oh, that's Miss McVane,
the headmistress. She's really great.
<i>¤[Trumpet]</i>
[Girls Screaming]
<i>[Girls Shouting] Verena, Tinka!
You've got a new roommate!</i>
- [Together] What?
- She's from Detroit!
- [Together] What?
- We take the honor system
very seriously here.
Miss Godard believed that the girls
should govern themselves...
in order to learn to take responsibility
for their actions.
- What's this?
- This? Oh... [Laughs]
I'm a monitor.
I'm on the self-government committee.
Elected nine times now.
So, I have nine stars.
- Taking a break.
- You're absolutely not allowed to smoke.
- Uh, where are you going?
- To visit my horse.
I <i>was</i> going to warn you
about your roommates.
But now, I don't think I will.
She's got fi! Ve pairs
of Pappagallo's.
She's got a great stereo!
Men on the floor!
Come along now, girls.
Scurry, scurry.
<i>Will you get into your room?
There's men on the floor.</i>
<i>[Girls] Hey, baby!</i>
- <i>Walkin'the dog</i>
- [Girls Giggling]
You can't twist to this music.
- It's too slow.
- <i>Just a-walkin'the dog</i>
[Sighs] Now, there's no place
to dance, anyway.
<i>¤lf you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog</i>
Ooh, this must
be the boyfriend.
"Love, Dennis." Ohh!
[Giggling]
[Both <i>Gasp]</i>
- I did not give you permission
to play my records.
- <i>[Needle Scratching]</i>
Welcome! I'm Tinka Parker.
And this is Verena Von Stefan.
- Art thou perchance Odette?
- Odie.
- Those are my shoes.
- We always borrow each other's things.
I loathe and abhor this place.
I don't see how you can say that
when you're from Detroit.
So, Odie, what are you
doing here at Miss God-Awful?
How come you had to
transfer from Chancery?
Oh, no doubt things were getting too hot
and heavy with Dennis the Penis.
<i>Up</i> your ziggie
with a wah-wah brush.
[Together] What?
[Both Giggling]
- Say that again.
- <i>Up</i> your ziggie with a wah-wah brush.
That's priceless.
Where did you hear that?
- I made it <i>up.</i>
- <i>[Bell Rings]</i>
- [Together] Dinner!
Go back <i>up</i> and sew <i>up</i> that hem.
Hold it.
Why, Abby and Susie.
<i>Sieg Heil!</i>
Parker!
Take those off.
Why? They're not jewelry.
They're offi! Ce supplies.
- Off. Or I'll report
you to Miss McVane.
- [Scoffs]
Abby, <i>up</i> your ziggie
with a wah-wah brush.
- So, what's she like?
- Mm, she could be improved.
We've decided not
to get rid of her.
- She's got a great record collection.
- Geez. Yum!
- Odious, this is Tweety Goldberg
and Momo Haines.
- Hi.

- Are you carrying Dennis' child?
- [Laughs]
You can tell Tinka.
She's had four pregnancy scares.
- Four.
- Was it beautiful?
Do you actually expect me
to answer these questions?
But we're curious.
We all have our hymens, <i>except</i> Tinka.
That's enough. Clearly,
she doesn't want to describe it.
It's like hog wrestling.
Isn't that right, Odious?
Oh, I don't even think she's
done it with Dennis yet.
- Are you gonna eat that?
- <i>[ Other Girls] Tweety!</i>
Where's my ipecac?
You hid it!
- <i>No! Oh, God!</i>
- I knew it!
- Tweety, no, no. Give it... No!
- Let go of me, Momo!
Tweety, don't do it!
Give me the bottle. Ow!
Fine. Make yourself sick.
You're only gonna be hungry again later.
[Vomiting]
[Toilet Flushes]
She swallows ipecac <i>syrup,</i> and then 15
minutes later she heaves <i>up</i> everything.
Ipecac causes convulsions
in the alimentary canal.
- Are you taking chemistry?
- Yes.
Great! Mrs. Dewey is the most
adorable teacher in the school.
She's gonna <i>help</i> me
to get into M.I.T.
- Who's your advisor?
- Mr. Dewey.
- Eew, Mr. Dewey!
- Eew, he's a lech.

<i>I'm so popular

<i>Dear Dennis:: Maybe I can escape

- <i>[Door Closing]</i>
<i>[Sniffles]</i>
Oh, good morning, Odette.
What can I do for you?
I'd like to know why you turned down
my request for a pass this weekend.
You wanted to go into New York
to see a horse show... [Sniffles]
Alone and unchaperoned and your parents
worry you may run off to meet some boy.
I'm required to <i>keep</i>
you here on weekends,
unless you're invited
by a friend whom they approve.
[Knuckles Cracking]
Dear, I can think of no better
cure for your... [Sniffles]
Conspicuous misery
than to make some friends.
<i>Don't reject them.
They're not just girls.</i>
They're you.
And if you get to know them,
then you'll be discovering yourself.
And that is, believe it or not, as great
an adventure as the opposite sex.
- Thank you.
- <i>[Sniffles]</i>
<i>[Door Opens And Closes]</i>
For the most part, your papers
ranged from the merely adequate
to the completely vapid.
With the exception of one.
Miss Sinclair, I congratulate you
on your <i>grasp</i> of Pan-European politics.
Now, remember, ladies,
tomorrow's assignment will...
- Verena, may I know
the reason you're so late?
- Cramps.
I wonder what would <i>happen</i>
to American foreign policy
if President Kennedy got cramps.
Possibly, history has already been
influenced by his bad back, sir.
Please submit a paper tomorrow
supporting your thesis, Von Stefan.
Miss Parker, do you have
any views on this subject?
- No.
- Hmm.
Plenty of room
but no views, hmm?
- Oh. Just as I thought. Empty.
Tomorrow's assignment...
- What?
- <i>[Bell Ringing]</i>
- <i>Review chapters seven through 11
in the Palmer.</i>
Come see me
in my offi! Ce after lunch.
If I'm not mistaken,
you show a genuine interest
in political theory.
Yeah.
Kind of, I guess.
I'm going to be attending a series of
lectures over the next few weekends...
in New York City,
which you might enjoy.
I'm sure I can arrange
for Miss McVane's permission.
And perhaps even
extra credit as well.
New York.
Between you and me,
Miss Godard's isn't exactly...
a healthy environment
for an energetic...
and...
curious young spirit.
We wouldn't want the hall monitors
to catch you with lint on your jacket.
Girls have been shot for less.
I'm so fat, I could die.
Look who's here.
- <i>Why, Odious.</i>
- Hi, guys.
Oh, my God. She's actually
talking to us today.
- [Laughing]
- What happened with Dewey?
- Did he feel you <i>up?</i>
- He invited me to a lecture in New York.
- You didn't say you'd
go with him, did you?
- He wants your bod.
Ladies, it's time to put on
our thinking caps.
Somehow, we've got
to get rid of him.
But then we'd lose
Mrs. Dewey, whom we adore.
Yeah. But if she knew he was
a pervert, she'd divorce him.
Right. She's got
to see some proof.
Like when my mom found those
<i>pictures in my dad's desk.</i>
Well, uh, I thought that maybe
if I went to New York I could
sneak away and see Dennis.
You don't need Dewey
to go to New York.
All you have to do is ask us.
[Snoring]
[Laughing]
<i>It's easy to get a weekend pass.</i> All
<i>you need is a letter from your mother.</i>
Dear Miss McVane: Tinka will
be joining me in New York City
the weekend of the 20th.
- Blah, blah, blah.
- So, what I need is a pass
that lets me get out alone.
That's what it is. Tinka takes
the train into New York and
stays at my mom's apartment.
She's in <i>Europe</i> for the year
and Tinka's mom is in Boca Raton.
- Wait a minute. So this is...
- I do all the mothers' letters.
Tweety wins
our prize every year.
- Miss Godard's girls are very talented.
- Let me see that.
Guys, wait!
How do you mail it
so it has the right postmark?
You mail it to one of your friends
back home, and they mail it for you.
Miss Godard's girls
are very organized.
[Chattering]
<i>[Engine Revving]</i>
<i>[Engine Revving]</i>
<i>[Engine Revving]</i>
Guys, I think I'm in love.
- <i>[Girl ] Do you have
something I could...</i>
- Schoolmaids!
Hi, I'm Snake. This is Skunk,
Groundhog, Possum and Beagle.
- We're the... <i>[Snaps</i> Fingers]
- [ln Unison] Flat Critters.
- What is this?
- We're a photography club.
We take pictures of animals
who have been run over.
Show 'em, Skunk.
- Eew.
- Eew.
- Eew.
- Eew!
- I love this woman!
She's everything anyone could need.
Poise and personality.
- Straight teeth, rich parents.
- Go away and leave us alone.
Her name is Tinka Parker.
[Purrs]
Tinka.
Her name is Tinka.
Now you are my dream. And you can take
away my money, my food.
You can take away my home.
You can take away my car!
But if you take away my dream
I'm nothing but a... <i>[Snaps</i> Fingers]
[In Unison] Flat Critter!
<i>[Woman Shrieks] What are you doing?
Bring that back!</i>
<i>[Man Shouting] Come back
with that hat, you little punk!</i>
So, explain to me one thing.
- <i>[Girls Chattering]</i>
- Why can't I have you?
Because you are
lower than dirt.
<i>You're subterranean.
You're a townie, for Christ sakes.</i>
I don't know you!
We haven't been introduced.
Is that how people fall in love
in your world? They're "introduced"?
- Come on!
- How sad.
How tragic! People like that are...
<i>[Snaps</i> Fingers]
- [In Unison] Flat Critters!
- Eek!
- Wo-wo-wo-wo-wo!
- [Girls Screaming]
<i>[Man] Now, hold on,
you young studs!</i>
Hey, Tinka!
Tinka!
- <i>[Bell Tolling]</i>
- <i>So, do you really dig that guy?</i>
I have some dignity, you know.
Odie, you're supposed to wear
the blazer on all <i>trips</i> into the ville.
- Didn't you know that?
- Yes, I did.
But, actually, I have a complaint
about the school jacket.
I fi! Nd it a little too restraining.
Cuts off flow of blood to my breasts.
- [Laughing]
- Five demerits.
You will stay in study hall
till bedtime every night for a week.
- By God!
- What?
What is that on your nose? You know, at
fi! Rst, I thought it was just freckles.
But now that I'm <i>up</i> close,
I see. It is dried poo-poo.
- <i>[Laughing]</i>
- Now, does Miss McVane simply
<i>pull down her underwear...</i>
- and bend over?
- <i>[Laughing]</i>
- Six demerits.
- Eight demerits.
- Nine!
- Ten! [Barks]
- Arf! Arf!
- <i>[Laughing]</i>
- That was breathtaking.
- Thank you.
You really have
a fantastic way with words.
You should be a speechwriter
or a demagogue or something.
You think? I mean, I've always
been kind of interested in politics.
Excellent.
Odious, we'd like to invite you
to join the D.A.R.
- Oh, I'm not a Republican.
- Oh, I should <i>hope</i> not.
We'd like
to show you something.
Always make sure nobody's looking,
because nobody knows about this door.
- There's a door back here?
- Yeah. Last year,
I went behind this tree...
to hide from the monitors
and I saw it.
This is the attic.
<i>We're right under the roof here. It runs
all the way along the school, you know.</i>
<i>From the dorms, to administration,
under the theater.</i>
- <i>Just about anywhere.</i>
- <i>And the kitchen, don't forget!</i>
<i>Wow... That's</i> all
<i>she cares about.</i>
- <i>Anyhow, we got the place to ourselves.</i>
- <i>Mostly.</i>
<i>The only people who come up here are
the maintenance men once in a while.</i>
They store old furniture and
stuff... and then we steal it.
<i>So far, nobody's
discovered our secret room.</i>
<i>This is where
the D.A.R. Meets.</i>
Mmm! We can get any
canned food we want to <i>up</i> here.
They store boxes
of it over the kitchen.
What exactly
is the D.A.R.?
It stands for Daughters
of the American Ravioli.
- <i>Cold ravioli.</i>
- <i>I think it's better cold.</i>
In the D.A.R., we share our most
secret dreams of what we want to be.
<i>Most of the girls
here at Miss Godard's,</i>
<i>they've got</i> all <i>the opportunities
to become something...</i>
<i>a good upbringing, a good
education, they're loaded.</i>
But, in ten years, they'll be married
with three kids and two cars,
a colonial, a collie...
they're fi! Nished.
That's why it's called
a <i>fiinishing</i> school.
<i>But we, the D.A.R., have
other plans for ourselves.</i>
I'm going to become a pioneer biologist
and fi! Nd a cure for something.
I'm going to start
my own magazine.
Like <i>Vogue.</i>
I'm going to call it <i>Moi.</i>
- I'm going to be a psychiatrist.
- I'm going to be on the cover
of <i>Moi</i> magazine...
as a famous
actress-folksinger-slut.
And Momo will be my doctor
and Tweety will be my shrink.
We all pledge to <i>help</i> each other
achieve our ambitions,
no matter how big or small,
for our whole life to come.
So now, Odette Sinclair,
what is your
most cherished dream?
I would like
to be an ex-virgin.
Your great ambition in life is to lay
with your legs in the air like a bug?
- <i>[Laughing]</i>
- I went home for Christmas
and I got a diaphragm.
Before I could use it,
my mother found it and sent me here.
So now, all I want to do is what
I was about to before I got caught.
All right. If you join
the D.A.R., we'll organize...
a secret "randy-vous" for you
and Dennis to meet at my mom's
apartment in New York.
- But how do I join?
- First, you must undergo
a little test...
to prove your sincerity.
Which brings us to another
item on our agenda.
Yes.
Mr. Dewey has got to go.
And you can <i>help.</i> You're
the only one who has French...
in the same room
right after Mr. Dewey's class.
<i>[Bell Ringing]</i>
Okay.
<i>Sinclair, your mother called, but nobody
could fiind you. Where have you been?</i>
None of your floppin' buggies.
- <i>[Bell Chimes]</i>
- Time's <i>up,</i> ladies. Please pass
your papers to the right.
- Package from home?
- Yeah. My mom sent me a quilt.
Verena, why are you so late?
<i>You've missed an entire period.</i>
- You mean, I'm pregnant?
- <i>[Classmates Laughing]</i>
- [Laughing Continues]
- <i>[Bell Rings]</i>
- Where's my briefcase?
- Um, maybe you left it
in the faculty lounge.
That's impossible.
<i>By the way, sir, I'm sorry but I can't
go to New York with you this weekend.</i>
Hmm?
Well, perhaps another time.
Good morning,
Mademoiselle Odette.
- Comment allez-vous?
- <i>Tres bien, merci.</i>
Whose is this?
Oh, let's see.
<i>[Gasps, Speaks In French]</i>
- Can you really order this stuff?
- Miss McVane!
Oh, look!
This one has three speeds.
Call Frank Dewey in here.
So, where'd you fi! Nd
all that stuff, Verena?
I stole it
from my dad's collection.
I found his secret
hiding place last year.
- He likes anything with <i>whips</i> and stuff.
- Eew!
Guys, cool it.
The warden.
Sinclair and Von Stefan,
you will come with me
to Miss McVane's offi! Ce, right now.
Verena, I wonder if you realize
how hard it is...
to attract male teachers
to Miss Godard's.
They consider girls' schools
the bottom of the barrel.
We certainly don't pay them enough
to alter their opinion.
So, we are fortunate indeed...
to have Mr. Dewey
on the faculty.
Yes. He's a very good lecher.
I mean, teacher.
There's some sort of conspiracy
afoot to discredit Mr. Dewey.
He is upset. I have no proof,
but my instinct tells me...
<i>that you are behind
this little gambit.</i>
- What gambit?
- Think of it as a tribute
to your talents...
that I suspect you.
<i>Oh, you're very smart, Von Stefan,
but mainly in the derriere.</i>
Now, at Miss Godard's we try to educate
the mind and not the buttocks.
So, unless your smarts begin migrating
from your heinie to your head,
the next time you fi! Nd yourself
in this offi! Ce will be
the occasion of your dismissal.
This is so unfair.
I don't even know what...
I have asked Abby to <i>keep</i>
an eye on you and to report...
anything she construes
as misconduct.
- Yes, Miss McVane.
- Abby, you may return to study hall.
Verena, when young people of one sex
are cooped <i>up</i> for too long in a place,
there is an unhealthy disposition
to plotting and cruel mischief.
I really think you'd benefi! T
from a weekend away from here,
yet I see that you've chosen
to remain on campus since
the beginning of the year.
I know your mother is still in Paris,
but you have friends...
who would invite you
to their houses.
I love it here.
It's my home.
No, dear, it's not.
I'm sorry about
your parents' separation.
Must have been a rough summer.
- <i>Do you want to talk about it?</i>
- No.
I mean... [Sighs]
It's an unfair world.
<i>[Plop]</i>
You may be right.
[Sighs] On your way out,
<i>please tell Odette to come in here.</i>
Odette, sit down.
[Sighs]
Odette, I received a letter from your
mother requesting a weekend pass.
- Yes. This weekend.
- However, your mother happened
to call this morning...
about a tuition payment and,
when I mentioned the letter,
she knew nothing about it.
<i>[Plopping Continues]</i>
Not a half-bad forgery.
I am referring this
to the committee.
<i>Odette Sinclair,
the committee has decided...</i>
not to recommend expulsion
and give you a second chance.
<i>However, you are grounded
for the remainder of the school year.</i>
- I would like to rebut.
- You're not allowed a rebuttal.
It's a fi! Libuster.
I have the floor.
- <i>[Abby] We don't allow that, either.</i>
- What is this, a junta?
<i>¤[R & B Ballad]</i>
<i>¤I, I who have nothing</i>
- I'm grounded.
- I never leave.
You promised to <i>help</i> and
instead you made things worse.
[Scoffs] Hey. We didn't
get rid of Dewey either.
You can't collapse because
of some minor disappointment.
You get tougher. In the D.A.R.,
we have a saying:
"No more little white gloves."
- <i>I love you</i>
- Come on. Let's go out for a smoke.
We'll just have to organize
some way for Dennis to meet
you here instead of New York.
Somewhere private where
you can do the dirty deed.
- Is that possible?
- I'll think of something.
I promise. But it's a waste
of my mental skills.
I'd rather be planning
your political career.
- [Scoffs]
- You shouldn't be thinking about sex.
- It's so trite.
- Come on. I'm supposed to be
thinking about it at my age.
- Don't you ever?
- Why do you think my brain
is so swift and uncluttered?
- Come on. There must
be someone you like.
- [Giggles]
[Sighs]
Alas, I lust for no one.
- Not even you.
- [Both Giggling]

<i>[Man] We make a special

Eve Godard founded this school
because she believed...
that girls had a better

They come fi! Rst here.

<i>Goldberg, Haines.
Back to your room.</i>
Not another blessed <i>peep</i>
out of the rest of you!
- <i>[Door Closes]</i>
- The D.A.R. Meets tomorrow night
after classes.
- [Girls Arguing]
- It's not going to be okay!
I'm not going
to get into M.I.T. Now!
If I <i>apply</i> with a lot of boys
from the same school, you know
they'll <i>accept</i> the boys fi! Rst!
- <i>That's not true.</i>
- <i>Yes, it is!</i>
<i>[ Odie]</i> All <i>l ever hear
is girls complaining...</i>
- how lonely and bored they are, right?
- Oh, yes.
<i>[Momo] Tinka, maybe. Not me!
I can stand a little loneliness!</i>
This is a school!
We're all trying to get smarter!
If St. Ambrose merges with us,
instead we'll all be killing
ourselves to be cute.
Right! Just imagine. We'll have to
wash our hair every night.
We'll have to <i>sleep</i> on rollers
till our <i>scalp</i> bleeds.
<i>Then we'll have to get up at 6::00
every morning for the comb-out.</i>
Your lungs will
be lined with hair spray.
Then, you need all this
equipment to push <i>up</i> the tits...
and blitz the zits
and spray the pits.
- <i>[Momo] She's right.</i>
- <i>Then-Then you stagger into class...</i>
- [Groans]
- <i>And you look perfect
but you're exhausted.</i>
You're too tired to even think!
But that's okay...
because the teachers,
they won't call on you anyway!
Also, you don't want to be smarter
than the boys. They don't like that.
So to wake <i>up,</i> you drink some coffee
at lunch but don't eat the food.
- You'll be on a permanent diet!
- I'm not gonna change the way
I am 'cause boys are around.
Oh, come off it, Tweety.
I've seen you at school dances.
It's like <i>The Three Faces of Eve.</i>
You turn into this simpering, fawning...
- Verena. Verena!
- <i>Wretch, and the whole next week,
we have to put up with your...</i>
- suicide attempts because
your date didn't like you!
- <i>Verena, stop.</i>
- <i>Shut up!</i>
- [Groans]
- Verena!
- <i>Now, you've done it.</i>
- <i>Don't listen to her, Tweety.</i>
<i>[ Odie] That was really
uncalled-for, Vagina.</i>
Look, Von Stefan. I know you like
this place the way it is, but wake <i>up!</i>
- It's not real life. Real life
is boy-girl, boy-girl.
- No!
- Real life is boy on <i>top</i> of girl!
- Would you two <i>stop</i> it?
- You should know that.
- Oh...
Look. It looks like this is going to
<i>happen</i> whether we like it or not,
- so we're just going to have to adjust.
- Yes, we're gonna have to adjust.
Where would we be now if
President Kennedy had said,
"Oh, well, we'll just have
to adjust to living in the shadow...
- of nuclear warheads on Cuba"?
- There ya go!
They're just boys, Verena,
not communists.
Ha! I'm not gonna live in
the shadow of the hairy bird!
Well, that's your prob.
You're afraid of boys!
- Order. Order!
- <i>Oh, you'd be afraid
of boys too, except...</i>
- <i>Order!</i>
- You've got nothing
left to lose, Miss Tinka!
- Prude!
- <i>Tramp!</i>
- Truce! Quiet!
- Come on! Have some ravioli.
- Oh...
[Sighs] Here's what I propose.
The St. Ambrose Choir is coming down
for a dance and concert in May.
Obviously, this is a trial
to see if we all get along.
So, we must make
the boys look so awful...
the trustees will have to cancel
the merge of our two schools.
What do you mean, "we"?
Count me out.
- <i>You're in the D.A.R. You have to help.</i>
- Well, then, I quit.
Me too.
What about you, Odie?
Maybe it wouldn't be that bad,
having boys here.
I mean, it doesn't have to be about sex,
right? They can just be our friends.
- Just like we're friends.
- Friends? Look at us!
Just mention boys,
and everybody's a traitor.
So, are you going to stay and <i>help</i> them
with their nasty little plan?
Come on, Verena.
Don't do it.
It's pathetic. You all want to sell out
the school because you're horny!
[Sighs]
- Well, the D.A.R. Is dead.
- [Sighs]
[Sighs] Long live
The Hairy Bird Committee.
- Hear, hear!
- Okay. Let's get some ideas
for the St. Ambrose dance.
How can we put them
in a bad light?
What sort of boys would your parents
never allow you to consort with?
Okay. Okay, well...
- If they were drunks.
- Mmm.
- Or sex fi! Ends.
- Good.
Good night, Verena.
So what do you want this time?
- [Sighs] I need 20 pounds of sugar.
- No problem.
And about two dozen
liquor bottles.
No. I don't want
trouble.
- I'm talking about <i>empty</i> bottles.
- Ah. Okay.
Fifty dollars.
Tomas! Do I look
like I'm made of money?
[Laughs]
<i>[Liquid Bubbling]</i>
- It's ready.
- Ahh. Good timing. I need a drink.
[Both Laughing]
Down the hatch!
[Coughing]
Ohh! Whoo!
[Giggles]
It's at least a thousand proof.
Now, try it
with some <i>apple</i> juice.
[Sighs]
[Coughs, Pants]
Momo, you're a genius!
<i>[Girls Shouting]</i>
<i>Keep</i> going, men. Play defense.
Get ready for the bully.
This shouldn't be a secret.
You should tell all the others
about the school going coed.
- Throw the whole question into debate.
- You tell a single soul,
and I'll tell Abby Sawyer
about your plans for Dennis.
I know what you're afraid of.
You're afraid they actually
might like the idea, right?
And everything has to be <i>your</i> way,
no matter what anybody else wants.
- You're a totalitarian.
- <i>[Whistle Blows]</i>
Come on, Verena, the school going coed
is not the end of the world.
You don't understand! You don't belong
here! You don't deserve it!
<i>[Knocking]</i>
- Abby, your parents are downstairs.
- Oh, okay. Thanks.
Have a nice weekend, Ab.
Bye.
[Shrieks]
What happened
to Abby Sawyer's hair?
Someone put peroxide
in her setting lotion.
[Sobbing]
They all hate me.
- Nobody could hate you, sugar.
- <i>Page.</i>
- We'll be <i>up</i> in a second.
- Sometimes...
I just want to tear off all my stars
and be just like everybody else.
Abby Sawyer,
when you are at the <i>top,</i>
there are always jealous people
who try to shoot you down.
Well, you just pick <i>up</i>
your chin and you say, "pooh"!
Now, when we get home tonight,
we'll put a nice rinse on that hair.
- Tonight? I thought I was
going with you now.
- Come on, Harvey.
- We have a meeting of the
Board ofTrustees, lovey.
- But I'm all packed.
Abby, in a couple of weeks
you will understand what
all the mystery is about.
- I can't even remember
what they look like.
- [Chuckles]
Anyway, I think
it's important...
I'm here to see my daughter.
Tinka Parker.
Uh, dear, will you tell
Tinka her father's here?
Tinka's dad's dead.
Excuse me. I think I left
my yacht running. Hee-hee...
- [Cackling]
- Get the guard!
G'day!
The plan needs
a fi! Nal flourish.
A dagger in the heart
of St. Ambrose.
Do you suppose any of the boys in the
choir is related to one of the trustees?
Let's check the yearbook.
I think there's a list of trustees.
- <i>[Boys Chattering]</i>
- Uh, hello.
[Verena] Hello. Is this
Mr. Frost to whom I'm speaking?
- Yeah.
- This is Mrs. Mortimer Frost
calling from England.
My husband has just passed away
and left an inheritance.
I'm trying to locate his heirs.
Are you, by any chance,
- Bradley Stoner Frost, Jr.?
- No. He's my grandfather.
Ahh. And your grandfather is a member
of the St. Ambrose Board ofTrustees?
- Yes.
- Well, <i>up</i> your ziggie
with a wah-wah brush.
<i>Yup.</i> He's in the choir.
He's mine.
- <i>Let me in, wee-ooh</i>
- <i>Wee-ooh, wee-ooh</i>

The master race has arrived.
- Headmaster...
- Headmaster Armstrong. Yes.
And this is Mr. Bert Chubb,
one of our housemasters,
and Graham John,
our choirmaster.
Uh, how do you do
and welcome to Miss Godard's.
We've got about 80 dollars
in the kitty.
It goes to whoever's date
has the largest set of nay-nays.
You must furnish proof.
Our roving photographer will fi! Nd you.
- Let's go.
- Masterly.
[Whispering, Chatter]
- And then there's the brown one.
- She's the biggest one...
Girls, you have about 20 minutes
to show your dates around campus.
<i>Then, when you hear the</i> bell,
<i>please escort them to the dining
room for an early dinner.</i>
<i>There will be
a tea dance at 6::00.</i>
And then the concert
tonight at 8:00.
Come forward when
we call your names.
- Schumacher.
- Burgess.
Hi, my name's Charles.
- <i>[Wolf Whistle]</i>
- <i>[Laughing]</i>
- <i>Fanning.</i>
- Delacorte.
- <i>[Giggling]</i>
- Winslow.
<i>[Miss Phipps] Goldberg.</i>
Todd Winslow.
How do you do?
- Theresa Goldberg. Nice to meet you.
- <i>[Gasps]</i>
- <i>[Boy] We've got a winner.</i>
- <i>[Boy ?2] I think
we</i> do <i>have a winner.</i>
<i>[Snide Chuckling]</i>
- <i>[Chubb] Purvis.</i>
- <i>[Phipps] Wang.</i>
Hi.
- Frost.
- Sawyer.
Hmph. Miss <i>Phipps,</i> I was supposed to
get Frost. I signed <i>up</i> for him.
Abby, you changed the list?
<i>Verena, everyone has been
matched by height.</i>
You are too tall
for Mr. Frost.
- Your date is Mr. Bateman.
- <i>[Whispering]</i>
I'm-I'm Conrad. Or you can
call me Connie or Darnoc, which
is my name backwards.
[Sighs] Come on, Car Wreck.
Well, I think Nixon lost the election
because of his enormous jowls.
[Laughing] You're terrible.
I mean, the least he could have done
was put a brassiere on for television.
<i>Stop,</i> please!
I'll burst!
What size <i>cup</i> would
you say he was?
Are you a soprano or an alto?
I'm a tenor but I can go...
- as high as an alto, because sometimes...
- Excuse me for a moment.
Oh!
- <i>Oh, I'm so maladroit!</i>
- <i>[Frost] Oh, geez. Are you</i> all <i>right?</i>
Can you ever forgive me?
Never.
Better go change.
I will be right back.
Oh...
My name's Verena.
Have you seen the gym, Mr. Frost?
- Uh, Frosty.
- Frosty Frost.
<i>[ Odette] Dear Dennis::
Be careful no one sees you
when you come in the back way.</i>
<i>You'll be safe once you
put on the jacket and tie.</i>
<i>Then everyone will think
you're a St. Ambrose boy.</i>
<i>Don't forget to put
the rubbers in your pocket.</i>
<i>If a guard stops you, eat them.</i>
<i>[Armstrong] What an extraordinarily
attractive group...</i>
<i>of young ladies
you have at Miss Godard's.</i>
<i>Won't they look good
on the cover of your brochure?</i>
Yes. Might encourage
enrollment.
Or we could redesign
their school uniform:
Shorter skirts,
<i>plunging necklines.</i>
[Chuckles] Well, l...
[Sighs]
- Are we allowed to be in here?
- No.
- You want one?
- Uh...
We could get high.
What, with aspirin and Coke?
Come off it. [Chuckles]
That doesn't work.
But did you ever try
Midol with Coke?
No.
- [Sighs]
- Wow, you're pretty vigorous.
These look more like Miltowns.
I wish they were.
[Clears Throat]
My mom, she eats 'em like potato chips.
She's exceptionally <i>happy,</i> but she
<i>bumps</i> into the furniture a lot.
Just like my mom.
Where do you think I got the pills?
- So they are Miltowns?
- No. No, Midols... for cramps.
Ah.
My ma doesn't get <i>cramps</i> anymore,
she gets subpoenas.
- What?
- She and my dad are constantly
slugging it out in court.
It's a situation I don't like
being in the middle of.
I know.
It's not much fun.
Oh, you know what is fun though?
Codeine and rubber cement.
I can be a lot of fun.
No doubt.
I have a reputation for being
sort of wild and loose.
[Chuckles Nervously]
You got... Co-Could I have
another Midol?
[Whispers] Thanks.
Would you like to come <i>up</i>
to my room later?
Ah, you're allowed
to have boys in your dorm?
Of course not. But there's a secret door
I'll show you. You won't get caught.
Well I'd love it
if I got caught.
Yeah. I've tried and tried to get
kicked out of St. Ambrose, but...
my grandfather, he'd just get me
kicked right back in.
He's head of
the board of trustees.
Why don't you like the school?
I don't fi! T in.
It's...
All the guys at St. Ambrose are
marchin' off the same cliff, you know.
The seat on the stock exchange.
The wife. The three-point-two children.
- Yeah. The colonial. The collie.
- Yeah.
- How you feeling?
- [Laughs]
No cramps.
[Creaking]
¤ <i>Gee whiz</i>
<i>¤Look in his eyes</i>
¤ <i>Gee whiz</i>
<i>¤How they hypnotize</i>
<i>¤He's got everything</i>
- <i>[Continues, Indistinct]</i>
- It's been a long time.
Yeah.
You seem taller.
No.
I'm the same.
¤ <i>Gee whiz</i>
- [Chattering, Indistinct]
- Verena, you may not abandon
your date. That's the rule.
But Abby left him.
I'll take care of Mr. Frost
until Abby gets back.
Now go and be a proper hostess
to Mr. Bateman.
Have you seen
the new science building?
- This is great.
Every 15 minutes I get a new date.
- [Chuckles]
Verena.
That's Hungarian, right?
- But then it'd be,
[Hungarian Accent] Verena.
- Excuse me,
- See l...
- I have to set <i>up</i> the refreshments.
<i>¤[Continues]</i>
<i>¤I love that guy</i>
¤ <i>Gee whiz</i>
- <i>My valentine</i>
- So...
we're really gonna do it
this time?
Yeah. I mean,
if you still want to.
Are you kidding?
- Did you bring, um...
- Yeah.
Bourbon,
and, ah...
Conceptive foam?
Dennis, I thought you were
going to bring, you know, rubbers.
This is something new.
The girl puts it in.
Eew.
I can't read this.
Okay.
Here's the diagram.
I think you have to
lie back with...
your knees <i>up</i> to get it in.
<i>¤Look out, Jerry Look out</i>
¤ <i>There's a big bad bird
that's flyin'high</i>

¤ <i>Twist that pony

<i>¤Aye yah yah yah yah yah</i>
- Looks like this dance is,
ah, going pretty good, huh?
- She's lookin' at ya.
Are you gonna ask
that guy to dance?
<i>¤Do the bird Do the bird</i>

<i>¤[Continues, Indistinct]</i>
This is special stuff
we made just for you.
If you want some more,
ask for the mystery punch.
- It's spiked.
- Masterly.
D-Did you guys
taste the punch?
Come on.
Let's go get some more.
[All Chattering Indistinctly]
Hold the applicator
fi! Rmly upright...
and <i>apply</i> pressure downwards.
[Grunts] I am.
Did you shake it well?
Give it to me.
<i>Okay.</i>
[Screams]
[Scoffs] Good going, Dennis.
Maybe we could get it in
with a spoon.
The girls would move
into this house.
I want to inform you
that I was not born yesterday.
I know precisely
what is going on here.
- I beg your pardon.
- This whole scheme was cooked up...
by Harvey Sawyer
and his real estate buddies.
They want to buy this campus
for subdivision.
This has nothing to do with me,
or with you, for that matter.
<i>The merger is a fait accompli.</i>
- We must forge on and
look on the positive side.
- There is no positive side.
With all due respect, Miss McVane,
I think you were born yesterday.
I fail to see any way...
that Miss Godard's benefi! Ts
from an association with St. Ambrose...
We have a rich
and very generous alumni.
- <i>That should be enough for you.</i>
- It's a <i>bottom-of-the-heap</i> school...
<i>for boys who are too dumb
or unruly</i> to...
I'll have to report to the trustees that
you and I are unable to work together.
Of course, one of us...
will be removed.
I apologize.
Please forgive me.
Wouldn't you be happier
if you resigned?
I can't.
Miss Godard's...
is my home.
I know that feeling.
[Glass Rattling]
¤ <i>That your love's untrue</i>
- You're all done?
- Uh-huh.
Come on, beautiful.
Let's begin the beguine.
Later, Car Wreck.
First, suck on this.
<i>¤But now you come to me sayin'</i>
<i>¤Baby, I'm gonna leave ya</i>
<i>¤And I'm beggin'ya this time, darlin'

- <i>Don't, don't</i>
[Groans]
- <i>[Continues, Indistinct]</i>
- Look at Tinka. She's at it again.
Do you know you can tell the way a
<i>person is by the texture of the skin...</i>
on the back of their hand.
It's very soft.
You're sensitive
and refi! Ned.
Ooh. It's rough.
Yeah. I'm callous
and unfeeling.
[Laughing] Get out, you.
Theresa...
<i>Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.</i>
Break it <i>up,</i> please.
- Is there somewhere
where we could be alone?
- We could try the gym.

This is not your night.
Better go change.
You stay away from my date.
I am warning you!
- Verena.

- <i>Go to him, run to him</i>
- What is wrong with that Frost boy?

Schumacher.
You owe me 80 bucks.
We got the photos. We got...
- How big were the nay-nays?
- They were like watermelons.
No. No. I don't know
about that one.
- Maybe more like kumquats.
- <i>[Loud Squeal ]</i>
- Hey, who are you guys?
- Want something, fellas?
- Get 'em! [Grunts]
- [Groaning]
- What's the matter, Tweety?
- I'm fat and ugly and I wanna throw <i>up.</i>
Hey, what happened, honey?
I hate them.
They took pictures.
- The pigs.
- Who?
- Which one of you is Todd Winslow?
- Not me.
- Is one of you Todd Winslow?
- [Chattering, Indistinct]
Take it easy, fellas.
Sir, I want to report
one of these boys.
You need a break from
this hormonal nightmare. Shall we?
Sir, this boy, he did something
horrible to Theresa Goldberg.
His name is Todd Winslow,
and I can't fi! Nd him.
We'll call the FBI.
Excuse me, sir.
May I cut in?
Snake. How did you
get in here?
You're so beautiful
I could eat your teeth.
Where'd you get these clothes?
Ah, some <i>preppy</i> gave 'em to me
after I beat him <i>up.</i>
Todd Winslow?
You beat <i>up</i> Todd Winslow?
Oh, you sweetheart.
Tinka in my arms.
I must be dreaming.
Pinch me.
I'll show ya where.
<i>¤And be my lady</i>
<i>[Boy] Mind if I cut in?</i>
- <i>Oh, my love, love, love</i>
- You're attractive, really.
Nice jacket. Hey, get lost.
- <i>Day, it is so lonely</i>
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
¤ <i>Yeah, now</i>
<i>¤Might forget it</i>
<i>¤So blue</i>
- <i>Time is</i> all
- Verena.
[Gasps] You're not supposed
to be awake.
- I'm probably not.
- Oh, rats.
Couldn't you just
sort of... pass out again?
I probably would
if you kiss me.
I have to go clean <i>up</i>
the refreshments.
Is this really your room?
<i>I wouldn't take you
for a Liberace fan.</i>
Love him.
Listen, I'll be right back
and we'll have us a wild time.
L-I'm chilly.
Could you tuck me in?
Hey.
[Making Animal Noises]
Who are those boys?
- Come on! We gotta go.
We've been spotted.
- Bye, honey.
- I can't leave you.
- I know a place we can go.
Come on.
Don't give <i>up.</i>
I mean, even if
you got pregnant I'd marry you.
Why?
I've imagined it, haven't you?
Would we live in a colonial
with two cars and a collie?
Sounds okay to me.
Do you believe in centralized government
or state's rights?
I'd just like to know
who I'm marrying.
I get the distinct impression
you don't wanna do this anymore.
I just <i>keep</i> thinking that
you don't know me.
What are you talkin' about?
I mean...
What's there to know?
- Hey.
- Okay.
- <i>[Dennis Groans]</i>
- Well.
What a convenient
trysting place.
And right over our heads.
Sir, ah... This is, ah...
This is my fault.
It was totally my idea.
It's clear to me that she...
lured you here...
<i>put you in a state of desire.</i>
Oh, you're not to blame
for answering your impulses.
Ah, but-but, sir,
she-she's...
Young man, you'd better
get back to the dance.
Dennis, don't go!
I would like to deal with
Miss Sinclair alone.
She is in a lot of trouble.
Hey, Dennis!
How'd it go?
Come on, critters.
<i>[Mr. Dewey] Cozy.</i>
Much nicer than
those sterile conference rooms.
Go ahead. Get me expelled.
I don't care.
And lose a gifted student?
And yet you should be punished.
I think we can come to some kind of...
<i>private arrangement.</i>
[Squeals]
- Get 'im! Get 'im!
- Who are you?
How would you like us
to dispose of him, madam?
- <i>[Animal Noises]</i>
- <i>[Mr. Dewey] Stop it! Stop it, I say.</i>
<i>Stop. No!</i>
- [All] Three, two, one!
- No!
- Wait there for Miss McVane!
- Jesus Christ!
- <i>[All Chattering, Laughing]</i>
- Fellas, please.

<i>[Chattering and Screaming, Indistinct]</i>
Excuse me.
<i>[Man] What are you boys doing?
Now stop this!</i>
Calling it a night?
- Yes, Miss McVane.
- Where is Verena?
- Gee, I don't know.
- Find her!
<i>You guys, have you seen Verena?
Is she up here?</i>
- No.
- Miss McVane is on a warpath...
[Screams]
- Hey.
- Townies?
- Well, at least they're not
St. Ambrose boys.
- [Scoffs]
Momo, listen, I'm on your side now.
St. Ambrose bites.
Then <i>help</i> me.
I can't fi! Nd Verena anywhere.
- Okay. I'll look for her.
- Come on. The concert's about to begin.
- Snake, wait here.
- Well, you're gonna leave me...
- <i>[Boy ?1] She's sucking his face off.</i>
- <i>[Boy ?2] He's the king.</i>
I'll be right back.
Oh, schoolmaids.
Heaven is where you are.
- [All] ¤ Me, may, my, mo, moo ¤¤
- [Burps]
- Are they all accounted for?
- No. Five boys are missing.
- Frost, Dinwiddy, Adams,
Schumacher and Todd Winslow.
- Well, fi! Nd Chubb.
No. No. I'll fi! Nd Chubb.
You fi! Nd those boys.
[Chattering, Indistinct]
- Did you fi! Nd Von Stefan?
- No.
I even checked her dorm room.
Something untoward is about to happen.
I can feel it.
I better go.
The concert.
Well, what about me?
I have to get caught in your bed.
Oh... someone will
come along.
You could start screaming
like you just came into your room.
Well, actually...
this isn't my room.
I knew you couldn't be
a Liberace fan.
I really gotta go.
But...
even after you're expelled
and everything,
- will you write to me?
- Oh, yeah.
Psst.
Need to sober <i>up?</i>
Yeah. That punch
was diabolical...
and I need to sing my solo.
Take a swig of this
and pass it along to the others.
- What is it?
- Hair of the bird that bit ya.
Takes a few minutes to work.
Psst. You know what you need
to sober <i>up?</i>
- Take a swig of this, pass it
along to the other guys...
- What are you guys doin' here?
It's time for our entrance.
[Mumbled]
Pass this on down, man.
She's not coming back, Snake.
- She's ditched you.
- Dead on the road.
But she kissed me.
Girls get very kissy
right before they give you the shaft.
- Yeah. Severance pay.
- Yeah, you're right.
What's...
Outrageous!
They've all been drinking!
¤¤ [Out OfTune]
¤ I dream ofJeannie

[All Screaming]
[Screams] My dress!
- What do we got here?
- We got three.
We got boxers.
Boxers again.
Briefs.
Cool tool. I'm a nature
<i>photographer</i> myself.
[All Moaning]
On the bus, Cooper!
Don't you smart me again.
On that bus, young man.
Get... Oh.
Frost, you <i>wipe</i> that smile
off your face. Where were you?
<i>[Mrs. O'Boyle] Headmaster.</i>
I <i>hope</i> you will discipline
this... human debris.
Let me assure you,
they will return
to St. Ambrose...
only to pack!
Frank?
Who's in there?
Well, Frank,
that about does it for me.
They're gone.
I'd rather be devoured by rats...
than be in the same school
with Todd Winslow.
It'll never <i>happen</i> now.
That was so brilliant
what you and Verena did.
God, where is Verena?
<i>Odie, what's wrong?
What happened?</i>
<i>[Miss McVane] You understand why you
can no longer attend Miss Godard's?</i>
<i>Of course, the boy
will be expelled too.</i>
Your father will
<i>pick you up</i> this afternoon.
We'll send your records on
to any school you <i>apply</i> to.
Mr. Dewey is leaving us
as well, if that cheers you.
- More tea?
- No, thank you.
Cigarette?
- Sure.
- Catch.
Quite a debacle,
the St. Ambrose choir dance.
Boys drinking liquor,
heaving <i>up</i> all over the stage...
I'd say they had too many
of your refreshments.
- My refreshments?
- I have no proof, as usual,
but these events have
a certain style I've come
to identify with your handiwork.
I did it for the school.
I know, dear.
I wish it had worked.
<i>But the trustees are going to
hush up the entire affair...</i>
and proceed with plans
for coeducation.
- <i>I shall announce it to the
school before summer vacation.</i>
- No.
Won't be the fi! Rst time
women have had to marry for money.
You betrayed us.
No.
No.
Miss Godard's was betrayed
by her own.
Year after year,
I've been on my knees...
groveling to the alumnae
for handouts,
fi! Ve dollars here,
ten dollars there... big spenders...
The men give generously to their
schools. It's a solid investment.
<i>They're ensuring that a steady supply
of the nation's leaders will be men.</i>
Maybe you women don't give because
<i>deep</i> down you know it's useless.
I might as well been teaching
needlepoint and gardening,
instead of physics
and government.
Twenty-eight years
of work,
- just so I can kiss
some headmaster's ass.
- Miss McVane!
You're right to be afraid.
Because after the men plant their flag
in this school, they'll bury us.
It'll be subtle and insidious,
as is in real life.
I may be at the end of the road here,
but you're young...
and you have the talent
and power to lead.
Don't <i>stop</i> the fi! Ght.
Wherever you go, Verena,
don't give <i>up.</i>
I'm counting on you.
Good-bye.
<i>[Chattering, Indistinct]</i>
Just because I'm leaving doesn't mean
we have to <i>stop</i> helping each other.
I mean, we're joined forever.
The D.A.R. Lives.
[All] No more little
white gloves.
Okay. Everybody out.
I gotta pack.
I don't see how you can sit on a horse
if Dennis did his job correctly.
Dennis was a dead loss.
Well, you'll have the St. Ambrose
doofus population to <i>keep</i> you company.
No. It didn't work?
The school's going coed.
Miss McVane is gonna
announce it on Prize Day.
It's over.
Don't be so sure.
- What do you mean?
- Never mind.
Good-bye, Verena.
Hey, I'll buy
your magazine, okay?
If you ever run for anything,
let me know.
I'll fi! X the competition.
Okay.
Verena's gone.
St. Ambrose is taking over.
Next year I'm going to have to face
Todd Winslow every day at breakfast.
I want to retch and die!
They're going to pull down
our grade curve.
They're going to pull down
more than that.
Ladies, it's time to put on
our thinking caps.
- <i>[Applause]</i>
- <i>[Miss McVane] And that
concludes our...</i>
<i>Prize Day ceremony.</i>
I know you're all anxious
to get started with your summer,
<i>but you must attend
fiinal classes.</i>
And I wish you all
a <i>happy</i> vacation.
[Applauding, Cheering]
Before you go, ah,
there is some important news.
Indeed so important
that Mrs. Sawyer,
<i>president of Miss Godard's
Board of Trustees,</i>
is here this morning
to tell you herself.
<i>[Scattered Applause]</i>
Good morning.
I am very excited to be standing here
on the threshold of...
<i>as it were a new era.</i>
<i>Next year,
this school will admit...</i>
for the fi! Rst time...
members of the opposite sex.
- [Disgruntled Chattering]
- <i>Specifiically, Miss Godard's...</i>
<i>will unite with
St. Ambrose Academy...</i>
<i>to form a single school on their campus
in Stoneytown, New Hampshire.</i>
<i>A letter was sent to your parents this
morning outlining the details of this...</i>
- Mother, no!
- Quiet, please.
<i>Our faculties will combine, but our
administrations will be separate.</i>
<i>[Mrs. Sawyer Continues, Indistinct]</i>
Attention! Attention, I have
something to say. Everybody listen.
- <i>[Girl ?1] Just be quiet.</i>
- <i>[Girl ?2] Hey, listen
to Odie. She's got an idea.</i>
We have been gypped.
Some of you may think this school
going coed is a great idea.
Others of you
may think it's horrendous.
But right now the point is
that the Board ofTrustees
doesn't care what you think.
<i>Did they ever
consult us? No.</i>
- Did they ever ask us what we wanted?
- [All] No. No.
- <i>We're only a pawn in their game.</i>
- What is going on here?
- [All Cheering]
- They teach us self-government...
and then they
disenfranchise us.
- <i>[Girl ] That's true.</i>
- They teach us
to take ourselves seriously...
and then they act
as if we don't count.
Well, hey, I say
this eats the big one. We count.
- <i>[Girl ] Yeah.</i>
- We wanna vote. It's our future.
They expect us to stand around
and be docile and meek...
in our little white gloves
while they wield absolute power.
Well, I say,
"No more little white gloves."
- Let's hear it. Do you wanna vote?
- [All] Yeah!
Then demand to vote!
Follow me to the dorms...
and we'll lock ourselves in
until they agree to our terms!
- Come on, everybody. Let's go!
- [All Cheering]
What about it, Page?
Wanna give these kids a vote?
Don't be absurd.
Anybody that doesn't go back to class
immediately will be suspended!
Abby. Abigail, you have
an insurrection on your hands.
Let's see how you handle yourself
in a crisis.
Mother, <i>up</i> your ziggie
with a wah-wah brush.
Now, girls...
[Whimpering]
Okay, now these go to
the parapet, third floor. Go!
<i>You call</i> all <i>the newspapers.
You call the</i> New York Times.
You call <i>Life Magazine</i>
and the <i>Herald Tribune.</i>
- My dad owns that.
- Really? Okay, then
you call the <i>Herald Tribune.</i>
Ladies, no vote is possible.
The decision of
the trustees is fi! Nal.
<i>Will you please come out now:::</i>
Or you all face suspension.
<i>[Mrs. Sawyer] "A voice and a vote.
Don't trust the trustees. " What?</i>
I want you to break through that door
and clear the building.
I don't care if you have to pick them <i>up</i>
and carry them out one by one.
In two hours, their parents will be
arriving to take them home for vacation.
In two hours, this situation
must be under control!
Yes, ma'am.
[Groaning]
Out, or we start swinging!
Now, miss, <i>put that down.</i>
<i>[All Chanting] Vote! Vote!</i>
Okay. Come on. Move it
right <i>up</i> here to the front.
No. No. You-You are trespassing
on private property.
- <i>And I happen</i> to...
- <i>[Tinka] Okay. I got it.</i>
The board of trustees has sold
this school down the river.
They want us to go coed with
the St. Ambrose Academy,
which is notorious for
their drunken behavior,
loose morals and lousy singing.
- Tinka?
- Tinka!
There must be some way
to get them out of there.
Well, there's tear gas. But they're
just a bunch of little girls, ma'am.
They are not just a bunch of girls.
They are Miss Godard's girls...
- they're organized!
- Well, we could surround the building...
and come in from all sides, if you don't
mind us breaking a few windows.
- Do it! Go on!
- No!
¤ ["Call To The Post"]
<i>[Horses Neighing]</i>
<i>[Man]</i> All <i>right, girls.</i>
<i>Okay, girls, next to them.</i>
<i>Back 'em up. Let's go!
Let's get out of here!</i>
[Screaming, Chattering Indistinctly]
Please. Please. Please.
Parents will please
convene in the chapel,
where Mrs. Sawyer
will answer all your questions.
- Me! Marsha!
- Face the music, Page.
I'm going into the dorm
to talk with the girls.
Ah, to the chapel.
Doesn't 75 years of history
mean anything to you?
- You can't railroad this...
- Our bylaws state that
the board of trustees...
<i>[Miss McVane] I know you</i> all <i>feel
left out of the process.</i>
<i>But legally the trustees
can take any action they choose.</i>
You have no rights!
And neither do I.
If you don't like their decision, all
you can do is not come back next year.
And all I can do is quit!
These are your choices.
It doesn't have to be
like that.
We can amend the bylaws.
We want to elect our own
student representative.
We can do that right now. Then all
the students will vote on coeducation...
- and it will count as one trustee vote.
- They won't permit that.
Otherwise, we won't
move from here.
And we have enough canned food
to last us here for months.
We've got the ballots ready.
- No, Odette. Right, everybody.
- <i>[ Odette] Please.</i>
- No, Odette!
- Please! Miss McVane,
Miss Godard's gave us a voice so now
it's kind of hard to shut <i>up.</i>
This is all rather new to me.
Carry on, Odette.
Now, this may seem
<i>pretty simple,</i>
but now it's time to decide how you
really feel about Miss Godard's.
<i>Some of you may think
of this place as a prison,</i>
<i>some old-fashioned prude's idea about
keeping us out of trouble...</i>
<i>because we can't be trusted
to look out for ourselves.</i>
<i>And you think times have changed
and we can hold our own with boys.</i>
So you'll vote "yes"
on coeducation.
Miss Godard's will disappear
like the dinosaurs.
Now, for others of you, you think this
<i>place has brought out the best in you.</i>
<i>In here they give you
the nerve to reach into yourself
and pull out your colors...</i>
and wave them
as high as you can.
So, you'll vote "no"
on changing this place.
Because to you, Miss Godard's
isn't a prison at all.
It's a place to be free.
<i>[Miss McVane] And the results of the
informal student vote are as follows::</i>
For coeducation,
77 votes.
Against, 115.
And they have chosen Odette Sinclair
as their representative,
should the board of trustees
decide to admit one student member.
And, in addition, they want to <i>help</i> the
school out of its fi! Nancial troubles.
Each one of them, without hesitation,
has donated whatever she can...
from her personal
savings account.
I have checks here
amounting to $3,000.
Now, maybe that's
a paltry amount,
but their generosity
just about broke my heart.
And I am sure that if parents
and alumnae follow their example,
we can solve whatever
budget problems we have...
<i>very, very soon:</i>
These are your daughters.
You can be proud.
[All Screaming, Cheering]
- You're in trouble.
- We're going home, honey.
<i>[Reporter] Yes, there's been
quite a turn of events.
The main mutiny is over...</i>
and the "rebelettes"
are going home.
And the president of the board
of trustees and her husband
has resigned as well.
<i>[Tinka's Mom] It's</i> all <i>far
too much excitement for me.</i>
<i>I don't know why you young girls
have such a great appetite for drama.</i>
- Still, I am glad you all
<i>stopped</i> them...
- <i>[Animal Noises]</i>
<i>From rushing
into this coeducation.</i>
<i>In many ways, the old ways
are the best ways.</i>
<i>Oh, by the way, the Wheelwright boy
will be back in town for the holidays,</i>
<i>and I thought since his parents
and I are such great friends,</i>
<i>that it was high time
the two of you were introduced.</i>
- <i>Those cuties have fun
can't wait to get home</i>
- <i>Bye, Odie!</i>
- Bye, Momo. Bye, Tweety.
- <i>[Tweety] Bye, Odie!</i>
- Bye! See ya next year.
- <i>[Verena] Odious!</i>
- Verena!
- We drove down as soon as we
heard the news on the radio.
You were brilliant.
- This is Frosty.
- Hi.
Guess what? We both
got accepted to Chancery.
- We're going to be
going there in September.
- Hmm.
Coed school will be
a nice change.
Excuse us, please.
You hypocrite.
I thought you said you hated boys.
I know.
[Sighs]
But I've been thinking.
<i>Perhaps</i> they're like dogs.
If we don't take them in, they run wild
and they're a danger to society.
Verena, <i>up</i> yours
with a Breck bottle.
