I thought I've thrown them all out...!
It'll ruin your liver Don't worry
Aunt Ming!
Look at you
madder than a wrinkled hatter!
And so scared like
your soul has abandoned you!
Stop drinking! You're nuts!
A middle-aged person
and you're still crazy
Why turn your back on me?
Why turn your back on me?
I'm giving you back this money
I don't want it
Keep it. It may come in handy
I don't need much money living here
But you'll be spending American dollars
over there, you know that?
What American dollars?
I told you it's Australian dollars
You decided to emigrate just like that
I don't know how I'm going to
spend the rest of my days
How many years have you been with me?
You may not know it
but I've been serving you for 25 years
Are you really that old?
Is that long enough?
Hey, I have good stuff
Excellent. They really smell!
That's right. Listen to the director
and come back early for rehearsal
Aunt Ming, have a piece
What about this guy?
How many years has he been with you?
Dad, we have time
Me and Jo Jo want to go shopping
To buy more trading cards?
Go see your mom backstage
Uncle, you don't know the trend
Trading cards are out
We're going to look Baby-G
We'll meet you inside the theater. Bye
Bye, uncle
Don't stay too long
We don't have much time
Aunt Ming, have a piece
Why does she pull a long face
every time I see her?
I haven't offended her
You yourself have been pulling
a long face at Director Lam
A Cantonese opera troupe hiring a
director neither Chinese nor western...
I think that's really ridiculous!
But the show's improved. It's high time
we reformed Cantonese opera
That kid didn't learn his trade
in a troupe!
Can't even tell stage right
from stage left!
Oh please! You want to be the lead
you work hard for it
I never complained about these things
I'm talking about your attitude
Stop nagging me!
I'm going to get changed
Lung! Chan!
Smelly tofu! Got them
at the best stall in Causeway Bay
Let's eat together
You already have smelly tofu?
Who bought them?
I did. You don't suppose
they grow on trees, do you?
Everybody get changed! So soon?
Put on the trousers first
Your daughter's becoming impossible
Mimi?
Of course. You only have one daughter
don't you?
Have you been nagging her again?
Be nice when you talk to her
What? A father has to be nice talking
to his own daughter?
That's the western way
And you want to emigrate?
Some mother you are!
Don't mother me
I'm playing General Diqing. I have
to get into the mood of being a man
We'll talk about these trifles
when we get home
Trifles?
Sum, Director Lam and Uncle Tin
are at it again
I can't handle them
Will you please come out?
This hot weather is making
all the men bad tempered
What kind of an attitude is that?
Now she's going to
take care of those trifles
Well, I'm going to take a look myself
Regulations are made by human beings
Bing is my disciple
The way you handle it
you're just not giving me face
It's nothing personal
Bing never showed up for rehearsals
or he was late
It stands to reason that
I find a replacement
What is it? Disciplinary action?
We're not in the army!
Bing learned his trade in the troupe
He knows all his roles
We're not doing a stage play
Discipline, Uncle Tin
What I want is discipline
Discipline my foot!
Bing is an adult
He doesn't need diapers!
So, everybody's here
Well, Director Lam
shall we rehearse Act III?
Rehearse my foot!
Sum, he's using
another guy to replace my Bing
Bing's always hiding away gambling
and doesn't show up for rehearsals
Damny you!
Don't you try to cut your teeth on me!
Replacing Bing is no big deal
What counts is your performance
Isn't that right, Director Lam?
Sum, Acting is ensemble work...
Exactly! The showgirls in Macau
do great ensemble work
They stand in the chorus line...
...they kick their legs
up and down and up and down
That's ensemble work!
Lung is right
In our trade
stars carry 70% of the show
We've learned our trade
and we know what we're doing
I've been an actor for so many years...
...and I've never needed a director
to teach me how to act
Uncle Tin, now you're challenging me
I don't speak English
I did not char-lun-ju you!
Can I make a suggestion?
Bing, you missed your call
and caused Uncle Tin to lose face
As punishment, you don't perform tonight
Director Lam...
Come on
let's run through this one more time
You just stop bullying me with English
And I did not chat-lun-ju you
Just get out of my way. Bing!
Sum, I...
We've had enough rehearsals
Go get changed, okay?
Just do your part
I'll take care of Uncle Tin
Sorry, Sum
Good, Uncle Tin. Uncle Tin's my man
Uncle Tin, I brewed this ginsheng tea
myself. Have a taste
Careful, it's hot
How is it?
That English word he said...
He said I char-lun-ju him
What did he mean?
He meant... he was in... trouble
And he wanted you to...
give him some pointers
You're always protecting him
You're a great actor. You can afford
to be generous. Give junior a break
But has he any respect for me
as a senior actor?
He's afraid you'd walk out on the show
Am I so petty?
That's it. Of course you won't walk out
on the show. How silly of him
Would I let my reputation be at stake
over some little punk?
I'd be the laughing stock
among colleagues
Uncle Tin, give him a good show. Okay?
Show time, standby!
Okay!
You say shi-ting-by and I shi-ting-by
I'm much obliged, Uncle Tin
Andy Lau!
Your mom knows Andy?
That time he performed Cantonese opera
at a charity show...
...mom was his instructor
Leon Lai isn't even in Hong Kong
His manager must have sent it
What a phoney!
Your mom is really cool
You're right!
Are you crazy? Stop fooling around!
The show's starting
Who are you?
Princess Sheung Yeung!
Emperor Sheung Yeung!
Let's have your name
and get ready to die!
I am Diqing
Supreme Commander of the Song Dynasty!
Your mom is so cool
Who's more cool? She or I?
Watch the show
A lot of people
Yes, all the shows are sold it
No other troupe can compete with us
It's Sum. She has so many fans
How about Singapore?
It's no match for Hong Kong
Is there encore for Cantonese opera too?
Just curtain calls
Encore, Auntie encore!
The audience tonight is really high
They're all mad
Here they come
Sum!
Great show!
This is for you. Let's take a picture
Thank you
You turn now
Let us take a picture for you
Sum, you're gorgeous
You're absolutely gorgeous tonight
Come, another one
I'll be happy
if you'd be half as good as Sum
Pardon...
Sum has to get changed
Please visit us another day
Sum, let me introduce
This is my buddy Ah Leung
He just arrived from Singapore
Sum Ah Leung, is that right?
Sorry, it's a mess here
Please don't stand on ceremony
Sum, this is my daughter Yuk-sheung...
Say hi
Sum Sheung, is that right?
Yuk-sheung is an opera actress
in Singapore
Really? You must teach her
Sum
you guys should get together some time
Right. Let's meet at my place tomorrow
Do you have time?
Yes, sure. That's okay
I won't take up any more of your time
We'll visit you tomorrow Yes...
I'll see you to the door
Those door keepers
they're not doing their job!
They've let the fans come in again!
Backstage, no admission
Jo, why are you wearing a boy's haircut?
You think it looks good on you?
Doesn't it?
I've never had long hair all my life
Short hair is good. I'm thinking about
cutting my hair short myself
Why?
Your hair looks pretty good as it is
Jo, where do you want me let you out?
Jo is sleeping with me tonight
I already asked mom
Excuse me, are you Sum's husband?
Yes
Really? Can I have your autograph?
We are Sum's most faithful fans
You want my autograph?
Yes, if you don't mind
Sum, Sum, Sum is coming
Hurry, come in
She got me again
What happened?
There's a fan who pinches me
every time she sees me
Both my arms are bruised
Really! Watch out she doesn't
knife you one of these days
Jo, change seats with me
Why? You'll find out
Here she comes. Sum's coming
Sum, a letter for you
They may get run over! Don't they know?
They're all mad, crazy people
Aunt, you're right up there with Leon
I just have a small turf
Look, that's really funny
They're really something
Peanuts!
Peanuts!
Peanuts!
Peanuts!
Sword of Dragon Spring
long hidden inside the case
Out of the sheath today
it gives off a brilliant glow
Maria, fix it!
I join the army
subdue the red mane horse...
And go a fighting...
Sissy, go inside!
Go a fighting... in the land of Xiliang
Are you a pervert?
Peeping on little girls!
What kind of nonsense is that?
Didn't you notice
something strange about Jo?
What? You yourself are strange
Them two girls are sleeping together
So what?
Two girls sleeping together!
What's wrong with that?
You rather have Mimi sleep with a boy?
She's mad! Singing at the top
of her voice early in the morning
And you...
going through your lucky draws!
Don't your eyes ever get tired?
No. This department store
is really something
You spend $500 and you get a lucky draw
If you win...
...you have 10 minutes
to take whatever you want
You can take home
the whole department store!
Good, this one's good
I beg you
please spend more time with Mimi
Okay
Ask her to go with you
to your English classes
Okay
Don't just okay me
Are you listening to what I say?
What is it?
You're never this serious
about anything serious
Are you know are your lucky draws
No, I must relax. I must
What's the English word for relax?
Or I'll never win a prize
Do you know
why I'm in such a hurry to emigrate?
Got it! I got it!
Really? How much?
How much money? Two dozen throaties
I knew I was going to win
when I got to the fifth number
The scent of durians comes a-drifting
come and get it
A fax from your brother?
Yes, he said the school in Australia
wanted some papers from Mimi
Did you ever ask her
if she liked Australia?
I'm leaving my business behind...
...to go there. And it's all for her!
Lately you seem not quite yourself
You're the one who's not quite yourself!
Going crazy over two dozen throaties!
It's you who's sick
Is there a phone card
for long distance calls?
Yes, $100 each
One, please
You really shouldn't
Oh, it's nothing
Have a throatie. There're plenty
Sum, your performance last night
was just spectacular
It's really an eye-opener for Yuk-sheung
Ah Leung says he'd like Yuk-sheung
to start a career in Hong Kong
And our troupe can use
a first supporting actress
Yuk-sheung has played
leading roles in Singapore
She's been on TV many times
She looks really sweet after make-up
Take a look at her photographs
Yuk-sheung
are you not going to ask Sum for advice?
Right. Sing something for Sum. Go on
Come over here. Yuk-sheung, right?
Yuk-sheung, come here
Open your mouth
That's it. Open it wide
like you're going to the dentist's
No. Like this
Are they real or not? They're real
Really? Let me hear
you sing Pissing every morning
Pissing?
No, it's Arriving every morning
Well, go ahead. Sing
It's Arriving every morning
You have good diction
Many Hong Kong opera actresses
don't have good diction
They have to pull out all their teeth
and get a new set
You don't have one false tooth, do you?
Let me hear you sing. Can you do this?
Behold the autumnal wind
and leaves of tung trees
Nothing but the autumnal wind
and leaves of tung trees
Every night I drown myself
in sorrow over you
Good
She really can handle high registers
Is your teacher Ting Sheung-sheung?
How do you know?
Sum used to tour a lot
and was a big star in Southeast Asia
Let's not talk about the old days
Uncle Leung, why not ask
Yuk-sheung to stay in Hong Kong?
Let her get used to things here
That'll be great
Yuk-sheung
say thank you to Sum and Uncle Ha
Thank you, Sum, thank you, Uncle Ha
He goes on and on
I don't know what he's talking about
He said to take off all our clothes
English name...
Yes... yes
We go fifty fifty?
Foreigner. What a question!
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
How do you say sum-mo-sung?
Mun-mo-sung male literary
and martial roles
He's a foreigner
He doesn't understand Cantonese opera
Save your breath. It's like...
Like what?
Like playing music to a bull!
Hello... It's me
What have you done today?
I may not be able
to come back for a while
Father has arranged a show for me
It'll run until the end of this month
I can't. I've given my word
Besides, it's a major troupe
He said it's better to do one show here
than ten in Singapore
No, he didn't
I'll call again when I have time
The phone card is running out
Keep talking. Talk to me
Father!
Have you been talking
to that punk again?
No!
Didn't I tell you not to call him?
Come with me
Give me the phone card!
How many times have I told you?
C'mon, two first class tickets to Europe
Mom, I'm leaving
Drink this for me. No, I got to go
Then take it with you. I'm going. Bye
Where're you off to? I'm going camping
Come back here. You can't go
But I already asked mom
I don't care if you've asked God
Mom. What's the matter?
Here you are. Drink some of this for me
Do you know
where your daughter is going?
She's going camping with Jo
Where? Where?
What kind of a mother are you?
Lang Kim-sum!
What's the matter with you?
Chan Yiu-cho!
You never consulted me about anything!
Well, you decided that we should
emigrate without consulting me
I'm doing that for her own good
It's also for her good
I forbid her to go camping
She's grown up
You got to allow her some freedom
And freedom means
total irresponsibility and indulgence?
Don't exaggerate
She's not going to a nudist camp
You can't go. Now go back to your room
Mr Chan
lately you've been very hot-tempered
What a nuisance!
Mimi, why are you still at home?
I can't come
Why? What happened?
Mimi, don't be silly. What happened?
Dad wouldn't let me
and now he's fighting with mom
What's going on?
Don't cry, I'll be right over
No, don't. Why?
I want to talk to your dad
No. I don't want to see you quarrel
Your dad's really too much
He's such an asshole!
I'm an asshole?
You dyke!
You're a bad influence on my daughter!
Dad
You... low-down mean dirty obscene!
You hear that?
How can she be so lenient?
She should have said
you're unbelievably mean...
...definitely dirty and obscene!
I've won! I've won a backpack!
Wow! A backpack!
Lung, Uncle Tin
before you make your entrance...
...we have a sound cue
and a light cue over there
You enter only after the spotlight
has come on. Okay?
Let's do it again. Thank you
Whatever you say
Music, please
Yin, have a cup of tea
Thank you, Uncle Ha
I'm really sorry, Uncle Ha and Sum
Two weeks before the show opens, and
I'm having my first baby in my old age
What can we do?
I do admire pregnant old ladies
You're bad!
You really have guts
It's okay. We can manage
Sum, it concerns our most important show
How're we going to manage?
It's okay. Don't worry
Anyway, don't worry
Director Lam. I don't like you
changing the script at the time
And you changed my lines
without consulting me
Right
The audience come to see us artists
All your big words alone
cannot reform Cantonese opera
Outrageous!
And all your Qs, goodness!
And you know is anti-tradition
The truth is, you don't know shit!
Right on!
Cantonese opera has been
reforming itself since day one
The name of the association has changed
the all-male cast
has given way to a mixed cast...
...Matinees have become evening shows
and role types have become
the six-pillars system
Cantonese opera has always been changing
So long as the changes
are good changes...
Cantonese opera will grow and prosper
I have good news:
Yin is going to be a mother
Really? Is it a boy or a girl?
It's only two months
You can't find out this early
Director Lam, let's call it a day
Let's celebrate
We'll go and have coffee, okay?
All right. I'm treating
I'm not going
I've not been feeling too well lately
I can't take stimulants
Yin, congratulations
I'll burn some incense for you
May you give birth to a boy
Thank you
Lung, let's go
Okay
It's okay. Just pamper him a bit...
Do you know how?
Well...
Put away everything. Let's go
Yuk-sheung, let's go
No
Father is waiting for me at the hotel
I think I'd better go on home
Do come, it's early
No, let her go home
You go on home
We'll have coffee another day
Can I talk to Wong Man-chun please?
How come you're here?
Aren't you happy to see me here?
You scared me!
Sorry. You're so silly
And you're bad
You just flew over without telling me
You scared me to death!
Did I really?
Where does it hurt? Let's me treat you
Impudent!
You're only a med student!
I missed you. I missed you too
When did you arrive?
Where's your luggage?
I got here some time after three
I came right over to look for you
after I've checked in
I called your hotel room
but no one answered
So I waited for you from across the road
I went to rehearsal
Did you see my father?
Yes. I saw him go into the hotel
But he soon came out again
What is it? Nothing
Let me look No, I'm fine
Let me look
When did it happen?
I'm okay. And it doesn't hurt
I'm going to talk to him
Chun, I don't need you to talk to him
But he's always beating you
When is he going to stop?
But it won't do any good
for you to talk to him
He'll just beat you up
I can stand up to him if need be
And where does that leave me?
But it pains me
I'm fine. I've joined a major company
Given time, I'll become the lead...
...I'll be making money
and he won't beat me again
But it really pains me
Does the name Lang Kim-sum
mean anything to you?
I'm now in her troupe
I never watched Cantonese opera
A man or a woman?
A woman playing male roles
It'll be great
if you could stay a few more days
Then you can come to our opening night
I've taken a ten-days leave
So long! What about school?
I'm smart and intelligent
Don't you worry
Impudent!
True. You know
I was really shy before I met you
But I've forgotten all about it
after I met you
Spare me your sweet talk!
Hi, Sum. Long time no see
This one isn't any good
How about this Hoi-ching?
The sleeves aren't very good
Get me another one
These things do bring back memories
don't they?
Consider it visiting old friends
when you come here
I mean them chickens. Feed them!
With peanuts? They'll choke to death
Look at you!
You get them all over the place
Nelly made this one herself
She really put her heart into it
Back in those days
making a Hoi-ching cost a fortune
By the way
where have Nelly and her son gone to?
It's easy enough for her to look for us
Much easier than for us to look for her
You're not bringing all this stuff
to Australia, are you?
What for?
There's no Cantonese opera in Australia
I'll give them to you for your dowry
I don't want them
I don't sing Cantonese opera
They'll just be in my way
I heard the kangaroos in Australia
are really lewd animals
They'll jump right into your house
and take advantage of you
Nonsense!
Lately Chan is even more
bad-tempered than kangaroos
What happened? He look liberty of you?
Let me look at your mouth
Punch your mouth
You got such a dirty mouth
It's like he's gone crazy, always
scolding people for no good reason
Is he on the rag?
At his age?
He's had his menopause years ago
I think I'm going to
give these clothes to Yuk-sheung
Ouch. I might have hurt myself
moving that wardrobe
I'll do it
Get a move on, okay?
Okay
How come there're peanuts
all over the place?
C'mon, get a move on
You punk! Leave my daughter alone!
I'll kill you...
Sum, Sum
Stop it... stop
Sum Stop this nonsense!
Chun, leave... go
Want your daughter miss the show?
No, Sum. No
You get drunk and beat up on people?
Now go on back
Go
This is good stuff
Sum, I'm really sorry
It's okay. You've joined
the troupe and you're one of us
Thank you, Sum
What's the legal age in Singapore?
Eighteen
Haven't you thought about being
independent? You're without talents
I don't mean to pry
into your family business
But in the long run, this is going
to affect your performance...
...unless you don't
take acting seriously
No, I like acting
My mom's last wish was for me
to become the lead
Did she pass away
when you were very young
When I was in junior high
mom got run over by a car because of me
Since then my father
has always disliked me
He'll get drunk and beat up on me
A lot of times he'll hide himself
in a corner and cry
I never saw a man cry like that
so broken-hearted
Men always hide themselves in a corner
and cry after they've beaten up a woman
Like they are the one
who's suffering the pain
But I was never truly angry
with my father
I want to make more money
so he can have a comfortable life
I like the opera, because for me
the stage is the safest place
Who's that boy?
He's a med student
Have one. They're great for drinking
You met him in Hong Kong?
No! We met in Singapore
Last year I was hospitalized
for an injury. He happened to be there
That's how we met
He chases you all the way to Hong Kong?
He's not one of those playboys, is he?
No, we're serious
I'm sure you'll like him
when you get to know him better
Sum, shall we go?
If not my father...
Don't worry. If he ever lays a finger
on you again, I'll beat him up
Check...
Someone else has taken care of it
Who?
Sum, I'm so glad to see you!
One of your fans?
Is she coming over?
No
This one is a crackpot
She seriously thinks I'm a man
Her husband died
and she wants to marry me
I can't handle her
What's going on here? World War III?
Dad scolded Jo Jo
That's right
I forbid you to see her again!
No
Say that again?
I said no! I can't live without Jo Jo!
I'll heat you?
Another father beating his daughter
Not again!
Have you been drinking? Are you drunk?
I'm more sober than you
Do you realize what they're up to?
Lesbianism!
I can't live without Jo Jo
You damned girl!
What're you doing?
Just kill me! I'm not going to Australia
Push me further and I'll kill myself!
Did you see that? Are you happy now?
What're you talking about?
Why should I be happy?
When did you really care for Mimi?
Did you ever fulfil
your responsibilities as a mother?
What do you want me to do?
To scold her like you?
And threaten to beat her?
Do I have the right to do that?
I'm not her mother
So that's it
You're not her mother
and she's not your daughter
I know it's my fault
You've been mad at me ever
since I brought Mimi home
I know you are a loyal person
and you're terrific to your friends
And you treat Mimi the same way
you treat your friends
a loyal person and a terrific friend
But you never felt she's your daughter
Am I not right?
What're you having?
Is Jo here? Big Jo or small Jo?
The boyish little girl. There she is
Uncle, no, auntie. How're you?
Do you come here every night?
It's my sister's bar
I work here part-time
This is some goofy stuff. Great. Thanks
Jo, did you ever wear a skirt?
I think you'd look fabulous in a skirt
You seem to have long legs
Auntie
you can be straight forward with me
Okay, are you fond of Mimi?
I guess yes
I like to be with her
I like that feeling
Mimi feels the same about me
But you're both girls
There're no regulations against girls
chasing girls, are there?
Then why do you dress up like a boy?
So do you!
I do not. I only play men on stage
Off stage I'm a woman, I'm 100% woman
A lot of men admire me. And I like that
How do you know the men
who admire you are not gay?
Gay? Will gay men like me?
Let me be honest with you
You look so much better
on stage than you are now
As a woman, you're rather ordinary
If you and uncle want to separate us...
...I'm sorry, you're bound to fail
I'm impressed
All right. I'll leave Mimi to you
Here are some forms for you to fill out
They're for entrance examinations
You pass them
you go to Australia with Mimi
How's that?
They're all in English. You're just
making things difficult for me
I can't do it
That's not true
You want happiness, you fight for it
The more difficult things are
the more necessary you overcome them
To prove that you are really
fond of Mimi
Otherwise you're just cheating her
I am not
Fine. Then it's settled
I'm giving you
this medicated oil as well
Use it when you get
all dizzy from studying
Excuse me, I'm waiting for someone
This table is occupied
Are you blind?
Am I pretty?
What's come over you today?
Do I smell good?
I'll charm you men to death!
Has something happened?
Is there a disaster?
Is it Chan?
Didn't I tell you?
What're you doing emigrating?
Consider that a favor
You'll become the lead when I'm gone
Without you, it's meaningless
even if I became emperor
You think I really like emigrating
Waiter, an XO, please
So, how're you getting on
with Director Lam?
You asked me to come out
to talk about Director Lam?
No
Don't think, answer me right away
When is Director Lam's birthday?
Where does he live?
What's his phone number? His pager
number? His mobile phone number?
Right away!
Are you going to apologize to him?
Good
Now what's the matter with you?
You're not having an affair with him
Are you sick?
It's been a long while
since we came here
Now let me ask you
You like me playing a man?
Or me as I am, a woman?
Or you never considered me a woman?
Answer me, quick
Are you nuts?
Answer me, quick You're crazy
Answer me, right away
I don't know what you're asking me?
How can I answer?
Are you gay?
No need to be that serious...
Sum Thank you
Good coffee
Real Brazilian coffee. Not bad, eh?
Uncle Tin, please have a cup
What a wonderful aroma!
This for you
No, I've done nothing
to warrant a present from you
But I bought this especially for you
Bing has been really working hard...
...and it's all because of you
Director Lam has given Bing
back his role
Well, that punk does deserve
a lesson from time to time
Bing. Yes, sir
Ensemble work is very important
you remember that
Be disciplined
and get yourself shi-ting-by
Yes, sir
Yin!
Yin, are you okay?
Call her husband, quick!
My tummy really aches
Call an ambulance
Hold it. What about our show tonight?
I just need a little rest
Take her to the hospital
Sum, what do we do now?
We'll change the bill
Yuk-sheung, come here
Which opera do you know best?
No need to change the bill
I can play Yin's role
Really?
I've been watching Yin rehearse
Director Lam, rehearse a bit
Feng, you too
I can manage
Let's get changed and standby
Sum!
Nelly!
It's really been ages!
You don't know how we miss you!
Nelly
I've been looking for you everywhere
Where've you been?
Chun is here
My son?
Where? Fourth row, third seat
He in the checkered shirt? That's him
Sum!
Chun likes that girl
He likes Yuk-sheung?
Chun is here. So I have to look you up
Sum, I beg you, promise me two things
Stop them
I don't want Chun to fall in love
with an opera actress
Why?
Why?
Because I want to defy fate
And the other thing...
You don't have to say it
Rest easy, I won't
Sum, you're on
I know. What're we doing tonight?
Oh my god. Sum, are you okay?
Have you forgotten?
No, I remember, I remember
I'm really worried
Don't worry
In our trade, once we step over this
hu-du-men and make our first entrance
...we have to forget ourselves
and become another person
Mother, where are you?
My son!
My dear son!
Mother!
Are you packing already?
No
You've won the lucky draw
They called
but I didn't have time to tell you
I won the lucky draw? Really?
Yes
Maria and I got all this stuff
in ten minutes
You almost killed yourself, didn't you?
A long last you've won the big prize
But my business has gone bust
What?
I've meant to tell you
Now you know why
I'm in a hurry to emigrate
What about your factories?
Gone! All three of them
are going down the drain
I have to close them down
at the end of this month
Why? Why?
Things are bad. I should give myself
credit for surviving this long
You lost all your money?
I still have enough
to start over again in Australia
I'm scared!
Scared I'm going to lose you
Why didn't you tell me? I have money
Now I have no sense of
security whatsoever
Please don't leave me
You poor fool
I'll stay with you always
hold your hand
and watch the world
come to its end with you
What is it?
It's okay. Dad and mom are okay
Well, let me tell you
I've saved up enough money to last us
for the rest of our lives
Dad's smiled! He's happy now! It's okay
Nelly
eat this bird's nest soup while it's hot
I made it myself
Yuk-sheung is a nice girl
No!
I don't want Chun to get involved
with you theater people
All these years you never contacted me
so I thought...
...you mustn't want me
to get back my son
You can say I'm being silly, so selfish
But I'm really scared
Don't, Nelly
I gave you my word I wouldn't get
him back and I'll keep my promise
I'm very grateful to you
Chun has turned out as he is
Why don't you come and stay with me?
You can tell him I'm his god-aunt
Or his god-mother?
Chun doesn't know I've followed him here
I brought you two durians
I remember you always like smelly food
Nelly, I just want to look at Chun
for a few more minutes
One for you, and one for Aunt Ming
I want to ask you something
What?
You gave up Chun for the opera...
...did you ever regret it?
Sum
Are you not feeling well?
I feel so tired
Yuk-sheung, life is so interesting
You'll never know what
decision to make or what to wish for
Are you feeling bored?
You want to go shopping?
Not anymore
I've won a lucky draw and almost...
...bought the extire department store
Want any rice cooker?
No, thanks. I'm meeting Chun
We want to do some shopping
Where is he? When is he coming?
He should be here any minute now
There he is
Sum, this is Chun
Nice to meet you
I'm really grateful
for your help last time
That's okay
Chun, let's take Sum home first
She's not feeling too well
No, I'm not going home
I'm not going home
But aren't you tired?
Not now. I love shopping
Let's go shopping. Let's go
Let's get this
Isn't it nice?
This tie here? Yes, it's really nice
It matches your round eyes. It's perfect
I bought you these toys. For me?
This is for you. Thank you
You shouldn't do this. Let's get it
Really? I'll look nice on you
It's a present
No... I insist
Pick another one
No, you mustn't do this
Let me buy it myself
This one is nice!
How pretty. Isn't it pretty?
What a good looking young man!
Let's get it. Let's get this one too
And this. Do you like these colors?
Well, some of them, and...
Let's get them all!
Get them all!
Is there a lucky draw?
Are all famous opera stars like that?
I'm not a famous opera star
When you become one
you'll be like that too?
Yeah
and I'm going to spend all your money
Chun, how about underwear?
You have enough?
Miss, give me four dozens. Both styles
Wrap them up... you get a problem?
Is it dirty? No
What a fine forehead you have
Sum praises me
Sum, I do admire your acting
You really become the character you play
And you cry real tears
I'll cry for you right now
No, Sum. Don't pay him any attention
Yeah. Show me. Cry
Let me gather myself a little bit
Really?
You can learn from Sum
Do you have a Kleenex?
Yes. I have a handkerchief
Sum, you're really great!
I did okay? Yeah...
Are you half as good as Sum?
You'll be 22 come December, right?
Yes. How do you know?
I can tell fortunes
I was born on Christmas eve
At six o'clock. What?
Oh! I've made it all dirty
Let me have this handkerchief, can I?
Sure, go ahead. Please take it
Do you like Cantonese opera?
You're not going to believe me
Last night was my first time
at a Cantonese opera. Why?
His mom doesn't like opera
as well as us actors
That's a bit too much
Don't worry. I'll take care of your mom
I've come all the way to Hong Kong
to chase her...
Am I being silly?
Yes
But you did the right thing
To do the right thing
you've got to be a bit crazy
There's no way
I'm going to pass those exams
That's okay. After you've graduated
and saved up enough money...
...you come to visit me in Australia
If I get a full-time job here...
...I can save up $2,000 a month
And I can visit you in half
a year's time, at the most eight months
Remember. When I'm having
summer vacation, it's Christmas here
You're the studying type, but I'm not
Your mom is right. I shouldn't be
an obstacle to your education
Work hard
We'll show them
Congratulations, father-in-law
may you multiply and prosper
May you be forever young
A gold peach, a token of my respect
Life is strange
The more you try to run away from it
the more it reaches out to grasp you
Finally we meet again, and there seems
a range of mountains between us
Nelly
all these years Sum really missed you
Oh no. That's my father-in-law?
Yes
Wife, you told me the house with
a big lantern is your father's residence
That's right. So what did you do?
Well, I saw him
and wished him many happy returns
But he chased me out with a broom!
What colour was the lantern?
Like your hairdo
blue with white words on it
My goodness gracious!
It's taken Sum a lot of hard work
to get to where she is today
In this profession...
...if she hadn't dedicated herself
she wouldn't have such achievements
Right?
You just put in the word longevity
into every sentence
I'm scared
Come on
You know, you really can't say
who's right or who's wrong
Nelly, Chun will always be your son
As to that business
about his biological mother...
...she's said
she would never bring it up
Prosperous father-in-law
I bring you longevity present!
A tortoise?
A male one! I.e. A pimp...
I'm going to miss the stage, very much
What I have, I get from Cantonese opera
I hope you will not forget me easily...
An artist who's struggled for
over thirty years
I, Lang Kim-sum
have no regrets for my life!
Thank you
Sum, don't go. I want to marry you!
I remember those days
when Sum started in Southeast Asia...
...playing minor roles
Yeah. One time
she really made a fool of herself
She made her entrance and slipped
and knocked the lead onto the floor
It wasn't funny at all!
That poor teacher of hers...
Her legs were shaking
She made Sum kneel down
before the lead and apologize
And that lead, she was so mean
She said Sum wasn't going to make it
to get another disciple
and told her teacher
And all because of these words...
Who's that lead?
Ting Sheung-sheung. She was a big star
Feng, come here
We're here to celebrate Sum's retirement
Sum...
Please say a few words
Sum, say a few words
I have an announcement to make
What is it?
Are you taking a disciple
before you retire?
Indeed I've met a nice girl
who's very dedicated
I would like her for a god-daughter
Her name is Ip Yuk-sheung
Oh great!
My god-daughter, isn't she pretty?
Thank you, Sum
That's Sum's family
Her daughter's all grown up
I'm telling you, times have changed
From now on Yuk-sheung is Sum's daughter
Dare you treat her badly!
Got you
Stop drinking. Quit it
Okay, I'll quit
This is Chun
Is that Yuk-sheung's boyfriend?
A family portrait, with mother and son
Mother and son?
What're you doing standing on hu-du-men?
Don't want to make my entrance
Why?
I make my entrance and
you'll think I'm acting
And even if it comes from my heart
you won't take me seriously
Well, tell me
It's very hard to see you go
You. You should get down
to business and word hard
Yeah. Give me another lecture
There won't be another one ever again
Expand your repertory
Farewell Under the Scholartree?
The Guilty Son of Sixth Brother
Farewell My Lovely
Yue Fei's Mother's Lecture
Find yourself a wife
before you lose all your hair
That's right. I don't have as
much hair as your darling Director Lam
Another one from the heart?
I want to say something to thank you...
...But I'm at a loss for words
Can't stand retirement?
Got all your emotions bottled up?
Who's calling?
Guanyin a Bodhisativa
I see. So it's Guanyin
Pardon this mortal
I have no idea you've come to this world
Speak nothing of pardon
Why are you all alone by yourself
Tears I have, but I shed them not
For they've not touched
where it truly hurts
Speak freely
When I was a poor exile
in a foreign land...
Good Nelly was there to ease my pain
Bring me daylight
and scatter clouds of sorrow
She knew my heart
and helped me fulfil my aspiration
Out of her own volition
she brought Chun up to be a man
How can I repay such kindness?
How I miss her!
Times have changed
and by a stroke of fate...
...a new union is today made
Where's Nelly? I have to find her
She's gone
She left you this
You're in a bad mood
Look at it some other day
No
Don't! I don't want to see you cry
Come, let's get out of here
If I shed one tear
may I get run over by a car
And I shall never see you again
I said I wouldn't shed one tear
How can I afford never to see you again?
Let's go have a drink
This is the last time
Let me have my way for once
All right. Let's get very drunk
Did I hurt you?
No, it's okay. Don't move
I was thinking, why did you decide
to play male roles when you started?
Are you telling me you've always
looked at me as a man?
Don't be silly. Tell me
I've had enough of men walking over me
I wanted to take charge on stage
This piece won't come out
You have a very big piece of ear wax
Don't move
I've decided not to emigrate
I know you don't want
to give up Cantonese opera
We'll just send Mimi
to go to school in Australia
And I'll stay here with you
Are you kidding or what?
Of course I'm serious
This is outrageous!
Thanks to you, I told
the world I'm retiring, emigrating
How can I go back on my words?
You just go tell the world:
I'm coming back!
You're crazy! No, I'm not
That's what Leslie Cheung
and Anita Mui did!
It's no big deal. Just tell the public
Are you saying...
...I'm a loose woman
who can't stand widowhood?
You may curse me, but I've decided
You do you mun-mo-sung
And I can carry your parasol
You're no good for a crab general
and too old for a shrimp soldier
Then I'll be happy playing a loose woman
Well, lie down, loose woman
You want me to do the other ear or not?
You're bad!
All this emigration business
You're terrible!
It's all a game to you!
Good morning
For women our age
it's easy enough to get a double chin
I do this every morning...
to tighten this here
And also, if you want to tighten here
you open your mouth like this
Five to six times continuously...
We have to keep it
And this is what
I do every morning for my waist
Try it. It really works. Seriously
Look. Let me demonstrate
Look at this move. Like this
Turn this way
Your waist should be like this
Now turn the other
This is a waist exercise
This is called heaven and earth...
And this is stretching the bow
What good does it do?
Well, it...
Try it. It works
You keep yourself pretty fit, I say
But it's a bit too much for me
Dear Sum, how're you?
I am really grateful for your help
when I was in Hong Kong
Yuk-sheung told me you've taught her
a lot of things
Things are fine here in Singapore
I told mom about you
and she asked to send you her regards
Seems she's changed her attitudes
towards Yuk-sheung
I'm planning to visit you and
Yuk-sheung after Chinese New Year
Warmest Regards, Chun
No emigration! Yeah!
