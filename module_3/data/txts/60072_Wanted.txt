Harry!
I thought we'd lost you.
Mum?
Mum?
David, look.
I've found Harry.
I thought we'd left you behind.
We did leave him behind, Mum.
No, no, I've... I've found...
Mum? Where's Harry?
He was... he was just here.
We lost Harry, Mum.
We did.
Just... we had to leave
so fast and I...
I couldn't pay.
We always had to leave so fast.
Lola!
Lola!
Pleased to finally meet you, Lola.
- Get in, Lola...
- Lola...
Lola!
Let's go have a chat.
Lola...
Lola! Lola!
Lola, wake up.
Lola, wake up, please!
Lola!
Lola, wake up! Lola...
It's me. Come on, we have to go.
Come on. Come on, get up.
Yep. Yep, that's it.
Come on.
Aaah!
This way.
Come on.
You'll be fine, mate.
Come on...
I can't... Wait, wait. No, no, no.
Come on. We have to keep going.
Come on!
This way, maybe...
I don't know.
Are you OK, mate?
Take it easy.
You're in good hands now.
Aaagh!
Just roll you over. Roll you over.
Aah...
So, what happened?
You can tell us, Josh.
I got here and, uh...
And what? Where are the women?
No, the... the Marics
were already here.
Did the women kill them?
No.
Terry Boke did.
You'll be alright.
Do as they say, you'll be fine.
Aah!
Hey! Over there. Come on!
You can do it.
Aah!
Get in.
Aagh!
Are you alright?
Yeah.
How do I start this thing?
No, no, no. No, shh-shh-shh! Shh!
Get it...
We'll lock up these roads here
to force the traffic
through the main blocks.
Should I head to the hospital
for when Detective Levine wakes up?
No, I've got it. You, um...
You keep looking. You call me
as soon as you hear anything, right?
Fuck...
Fuck!
Fuck!
Fuck...
Fuck!
What's this other cop's name?
Joshua Levine. He killed 'em both.
Where is he?
Hospital in Mossman.
He got shot too.
The cops have got the car.
We better be quick,
grab what we can.
I think it's stopped bleeding.
How are you feeling?
Better. Thanks.
I think it was just a graze.
Ow!
Sorry.
What happened to that man?
Lola?
A police spokesman
said an air unit
from Kalfern will be dispatched,
along with two police officers
from the York District
to help in the search.
Two have been confirmed dead,
while a police officer has been
taken to Mossman District Hospital
and is undergoing surgery.
He's alive.
Yeah. Good for him.
Anyone with half a brain would have
known what we were driving into.
I mean, cane fields? Really?
We could still
give ourselves up to him.
I mean, he... he must know
the truth now.
Yeah, well, you know what? You can call
him when we're a long way from here.
It's not exactly my idea
of a safe haven.
Oh, shit.
So, we lost it all?
Everything?
Well, not everything.
'Cause we've still got the money.
Pardon?
I hid it... in a locker.
Along with a shit-load of drugs.
What?!
The car's panelling
was filled with drugs.
So, that's what this was about!
Yep. Ow!
Why did you hide the drugs?
Thought we could use it
as collateral.
There's just one problem.
Of course there is.
Well, I hid it in a locker
in Mossman
and your mate, that bloody cop,
has got the key.
Well, why don't we just go there
and smash it open?
Because there's a guard.
Well, why did you hide it there?
"Never leave money in the car."
What...?
Ohh!
It's true.
Oh, that hurts.
Oh, God, I'm so tired.
Ohh... I'm more tired.
I can't remember sleeping.
I remember the sound
of you sleeping.
I...don't!
Yeah, you do.
I don't snore!
You so do.
Oh...
You need to rest.
Nuh.
You heard the radio.
They're sending air units out.
We need to get our stuff back.
And I need to get to see David.
And then we need to
get the hell out of here.
OK, so... then, what?
Well, you know how to hot-wire
a car, don't you?
Do you know the way
to the hospital?
Yep.
We should split up and look for his
room when we get there. Yeah, I know.
You know, I could have hot-wired...
Yeah, Chelsea, shut up.
Did you see any cops?
No. Did you find his room?
Nuh.
There's no guarantee the key
or the passports are there anyway.
Why don't I just ask?
No.
I'll meet you back at the car.
No.
Chelsea, no! Ow...
Chelsea!
Um, excuse me?
I'm looking for Joshua Levine.
Are you related?
I'm his girlfriend.
Well, his fiancee.
Uh... well, I think he was gonna ask.
It's against regulation
for non-family members
to see patients post-op.
OK, it's just... I, um...
Sorry. I, uh...
I... I just don't want to be
a widow before I'm a bride.
Do you know?
OK, come on.
Thank you.
Mr Levine, you have a visitor.
How are you feeling?
Better...
Hi, darling!
Do you have a vase?
Sure.
Thank you.
Five minutes.
No passports, no passports.
Ohh...
Oi, oi, oi?
Chelsea?
Why...?
Why are you here?
We thought you were dead.
Hey, I thought...
Ah! I thought YOU were dead.
Look, I have to go. Sorry.
No, wait, wait, wait.
Wait. I...
I didn't know
what we were driving into.
I know... I know
that Ray is involved.
He probably did try and kill you.
So, you do believe us now?
Now that YOU'VE been shot.
I...
Can I help you?
Yeah, I'm looking for Josh Levine.
Are you related?
Um...
Police officer.
Oh. OK. He's in the Duncan Wing.
Uh, but he's with someone.
- What?
- His fiancee.
Chelsea, it's safer for you here.
No, it's not safe for us anywhere.
You're a policeman and he tried
to have you killed.
The police officer outside my door,
guarding the whole hospital...
There's no cops out there.
You better call someone you can
trust. I'm sorry, I have to go.
Wait...
Ah! Wait, this is crazy.
Are you sure?
It was him.
Do you want to go back and check?
I'm gonna be sick.
No, no, not yet.
Hey, what are you doing?!
I got the key but no passports.
No... No, no, no! Chelsea!
Ah!
Go! Drive! Drive!
There better be
a bloody good reason for this.
No, sorry, one more time?
He knows the truth,
so they'll kill him.
And?
And we need him.
We need a wounded cop
like a hole in the head.
I'm telling you, we are safer
to go to the police station.
Hey! Sorry, there's no "we" here.
And forgive me if I don't trust
your idea of safe.
Look, let's just take him somewhere,
away from that other cop.
I'm not making any detours.
We're gonna drop him off here.
No! If he tells them the truth, that
we're innocent, then this is over.
You are not learning.
Where are we?
Kansas, Dorothy.
Wait here. Be right back.
Oh!
Where's she going?
Chelsea? Hey, what's she doing?
Mate, you... you don't have to do
what she tells you.
But... She's the only reason
I'm alive right now.
Yeah, but don't you want things
to go back to normal?
What's normal?
A good job.
A good house.
A bloke that cares for you.
You can't just
keep running, Chelsea.
Why don't you let us
take that for you?
Ah...
You had us worried there
for a while.
Had a good run, though, didn't you?
I don't know what you heard about
me, but I'll tell you one thing.
My word is my word.
And you...
...are gonna die tonight.
Now, we can make it
quick and painless...
...if... you tell me the truth.
Or...
...not so quick and painless.
So...
Who is he?
Who do you work for?
I don't work for anyone.
Aagh!
Lola!
On the ground. On the ground!
No, no!
Stay down!
Lola, what are you doing?
Chelsea, get in the car.
Lola, no.
Chelsea, stay!
Lola! Lola!
Lola, I'm a police officer
and I can help you.
Right now, you're just another guy
with a gun in my face.
Are you OK?
Where are we going?
A place I know.
If it's still there.
Hey, thanks for back there.
That's... Do you think he's dead?
I know we're alive.
Hey...
Hey, Chelsea?
You haven't done anything wrong, OK?
He was gonna kill me.
Yep.
You did the right thing.
You saved my life.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I delivered what was asked.
What more could I do?
Really?
Well, I don't see how they think
I'm responsible.
Ray, just stop.
Listen to yourself.
You sound like the kids.
How are they?
You know, if you can't fix
this problem, Ray,
then your next step is to work out
how you can break cleanly from us.
Wait... wait... wait...
What are you saying?
I have to go.
Ah...
Nielsen Point.
What?
Nielsen Point.
That's where your wife is.
Where your kids are too.
I told you where the women were
and where the car was.
I gave them to you on a platter.
You gave me nothing.
Now I'm taking.
Well, you listen to me.
You listen.
I just read the charge sheet
written out by Levine.
He's gonna be pushing
for a long stretch.
Attempted murder,
assault, kidnapping.
You need me.
I can make that disappear.
I can bring you down
to a couple of years, tops,
and get you the money and the drugs.
But you have to listen to me
and do as I say.
Wow!
Yeah. This was my dad's,
uh, holiday home.
Well, a place he used, anyway,
to stash his goods.
Really?
Yeah. He and some of his mates.
And now, here I am.
Ohh...
For how long, do you think?
Just for tonight.
We're gonna have to keep moving.
I need to get to David -
finally tell him the truth
about his crap mother.
Lola, you're not a crap mum.
You're a good mum.
You kept David safe
for all those years.
Yeah...
You've... kept me safe.
I doubt your mother would approve of
the way I've kept YOU safe.
Mum would have loved you.
You're the first person
since she died
who's treated me like more than
just some... helpless little girl.
Did your father leave
anything to drink?
Probably.
I doubt there'll be any, uh,
cranberry to go with it, though.
Here y'are.
Thank you.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Oh!
Oh...
Hey, we can't keep driving, Lola.
It's too risky.
Well, we can't fly.
What about seaplanes?
I mean, they go from
any harbour or river, right?
And there's no security.
So, we could just hop on a plane and
go to some isolated island somewhere
and just wait for all of this
to die down,
and then we can fly back
and get new passports.
How's that shoulder?
Why?
For the money?
Oh...
What was the tipping point
for you, Ray?
Or were you always bent?
Do you know when that question
was first put to me?
Yesterday.
A couple of the boys
came into my office.
They were worried about the leak.
I knew... I knew someone was
on the take. I just didn't know who.
And then they asked me this...
"Do you think Levine's always been
bent or have the Marics got to him?"
Yeah, right.
Well, that's what I thought and...
But it got me thinking...
Why did you go to
Lola Buckley's flat, against orders?
Why did you steal evidence
from Forensics?
Go bouncing from one place
to another,
almost like you were trying
to hide something?
And then, when you leaked
Lola's ID to the press,
effectively warning her,
and flying up here, well...
...there's more than a few
on the task force
starting to ask questions.
And what questions were they, Ray?
"Why?"
"For the money?"
I'll be giving my full account
to Internal when I fly back.
You'll be giving it
sooner than that, son.
Anton Maric just made a statement
indicating that
you were instrumental
in his criminal operations.
Joshua Levine, I'm arresting you
as an accessory for the murder
of Detective Constable Jones.
Constables?
That's him.
What are you doing here, Lola?
Are you OK?
See you, mate.
I'm fine.
They said you'd killed a cop.
It's not true.
What happened?
They made a mistake.
A mistake?
There's a national manhunt.
They're saying you're armed.
Have the police contacted you yet?
No.
No, I told my boss
I was taking a break.
No-one knows where I'm going.
Mum?
What's going on?
I need to tell you something.
Why didn't you ever tell me?
Your father was a very violent man.
I tried to leave so many times.
And then, one night,
I knew if I didn't do something,
he was gonna kill me.
So... I stabbed him.
And he died.
I should have gone to the police,
I should have turned myself in.
I found out I was pregnant...
...with you.
So, I ran.
I changed my name and I ran.
And that's why we had to
keep on running.
I'm sorry.
I...I should have told you this
a long time ago.
What are you going to do now?
I'm gonna find somewhere safe,
just for a little while.
Then... sort this mess out.
I can help you. I have contacts.
No...
David, I don't want you involved.
I've stuffed up your life enough.
I'll be OK.
I've got a plan.
And when I know it's safe,
I'll contact you, OK?
I love you, David.
Last night,
there was a dramatic development
in Far North Queensland,
as the hunt continued
for two females implicated
in the death of a Sydney policeman.
The sensational arrest of
Homicide Detective Joshua Levine
has sent shock waves through
the New South Wales Police Force.
It's a major breakthrough
for the investigation
into last week's shooting
of police officer Keith Jones,
and follows the discovery
of at least two other bodies
in the Bison cane fields
two hours south of Mossman.
The New South Wales
Police Commissioner has said
that although the arrest of
a serving police officer
is deeply disturbing,
there was no evidence
of corruption...
Maybe we can anonymously call them,
tell them he's innocent,
and then we'll just get
the next plane.
That cop Stanton's
never gonna stop chasing us
until he gets what he wants.
So, what do we do?
We give him what he wants.

Do you know who this is?
Yes.
Do you know what we want?
No.
We just want our freedom back.
We want all this to go away.
As do I.
So, where are you?
Mossman.
Look, we'll give you what's yours.
We just want our passports
and some money. That's it.
That sounds fair.
Where do you want to meet?
Drive to Port Callum.
I'll call you in exactly two hours.
I'll give you
further instructions then.
If you try anything,
if I smell a trap...
...I'll burn your drugs
and you'll never see us again.
You stupid, stupid girl.
You ready?
No.
You'll be OK.
G'day, Lola.
Out.
Move!
Stop.
Clumsy.
Whatever happened to trust?
Where's the rest of it?
Let her go
and I'll take you to your drugs.
How stupid do you think I am?!
Because I have to say,
I was really beginning to believe
that you two were
something special, until this.
Now, you...
You get the bag now
or I will shoot her in the face.
Do you understand?
Alright...
If you'd given me the drugs
back in Sydney,
you would have saved us
a world of pain.
What are you doing? No!
Where is it, Lola?
Where is it?!
- Where?!
- Don't tell him.
Where is it?
Let her go.
You tell me! You tell me!
Where is it?!
Stop...
Let her go!
Alright!
Stop!
Move away.
Aaagh!
Aaagh! Aaagh! Aaagh! Aaagh!
Get it off! Get it off!
Get his cuffs.
Aaagh!
Ohh...
I'll bet that stings, doesn't it?
I wasn't gonna kill you.
Yeah, you were.
We would have given you everything,
if you'd just left us alone.
I had no choice!
You've got no idea
who you're dealing with.
Was it worth it?
Killing people just for money?
It's never about the money.
Did you get all that?
Yep.
Oh, great.
So, when are the police coming?
Uh, about an hour, I think.
Right. Uh, isn't the reporter
coming first?
No, no, we're gonna
drop the camera to her.
Oh!
Yeah.
Uh, I think that's it. Oh...
You got your drugs? Yeah.
One last thing.
How stupid do you think WE are?
Watch those fire ants.
They like the smell of blood.
Lola... Lola!
Lola!
LOLA!
Mr Morrison?
Your daughter's waiting in the car.
Good to see you, Dad.
I'm sorry about Ray, darling.
Do we know what these women
have told the police?
No. We've lost most of
our police resources.
We've lost more than that.
I know.
But I've taken steps
to resolve this.
It shouldn't be long now.
Good girl. I want that key tag.
Why don't you come too, Lola?
I mean, it's safe now. They're...
they're offering an amnesty.
Not for everything.
But Josh says that
it won't hold up in court.
My dad says that too.
Come on, you don't want to
keep running, do you?
I don't know.
I just need some time
to think it through.
Have a rest.
And I've never been
on a seaplane, so...
OK.
Well, um, thank you, for, um...
You too.
My only friend.
You'll be OK.
Sure you don't want to
take some money?
Oh, no, I'm actually loaded.
Well, my father...
Well, your father is.
See you, Brigitte.
Chelsea,
where... where are you?
The Commissioner's waiting for us.
Lola's not coming.
Alright.
Alright, we'll keep talking to her,
but where are you, Chelsea?
I'm not coming either.
You're innocent.
They... they know that now.
Things are gonna go back
to the way they were.
Everything will be normal again.
I can't.
Not yet.
