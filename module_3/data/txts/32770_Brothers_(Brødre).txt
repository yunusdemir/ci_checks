Eight years,
more than 200 fighters
and around 1 5 deaths!
This place you see behind me
is Mumbai's illegal
street Fighting battleground.
Mister. Excuse me.
Do you sleep here evey night?
- Yes, madam.
Are you aware that fights
take place here evey night?
Where? Here?
No. l don't know
anything about it.
A spo_ in 40 countries..
What's he saying Sin
- ...but banned in India
Street-fighting will finally
get its recognition as a spo_.
That's true, Bhosle.
Ex-fighter Peter Briganza
is bringing..
Go and bring him.
- Yes, sir.
.. .the International Fighting
Championship, R2F to India.
Sir, why was this spo_
deemed illegal, until now?
In India, even kissing
in public is illegal.
lt's vey sad.
This county never gave
any recognition
to its mixed-ma_ial
a_s fighters as spo_smen.
They never got the respect
they dese_ed.
Maybe even the government
is afraid
of setting the
Indian fighters free.
But now the entire world's
going to hear
about the Right 2 Fight!
That is R_f!
Come on, Gary. Time to go.
Mr. Brigan2a, do you think
we have world class fighters?
Of course, we do.
We just n_ to find them,
that's all.
We n_ to find fighters
like in the old times.
Suleiman Sheikh, Baa2 Rawat
and Garson Fernandes.
lnmate no. 301 ,
Garson Fernandes.
Gary, you're still famous.
They just mentioned
your name on television.
Sign here.
Are you done, Bhosle?
- Yes, sir.
Prepare Gary's release papers.
Hurry up.
- Yes, sir. They're ready.
We've been waiting for so long.
He won't come out sooner
if you get restless.
Look behind you. He's here.
Don't worry about the bruises.
lt's normal, after all
he wants to be tough like you.
l'm still practicing, dad.
Come and see it sometime.
Gary.
Gary, your back is hunched.
Come on.
Dad, your brand.
l quit.
What are you saying? l brought
it because it was your favorite.
Didn't David come?
l'm here, isn't that enough?
My Princess is ready.
Mama, come quickly.
Mama, come quickly.
My Princess is ready.
But that's my David.
Jenny, can we stop this now?
Take that.
Poopoo.
David.
Happy birthday to you!
Happy birthday, happy birthday..
Stupid, watch where
you're driving.
Hey, Gary.
Welcome home.
Come.
Stop staring, Gary.
Hand me the cloth.
Maria..
Who changed this?
Who changed this?
lt should be where
Maria used to keep it.
Keep it near the door.
the kitchen door.
She'll sit down
after she's done..
Hey, dad. - She needs to
sit down when she's tired.
What's wrong with you?
What are you doing?
Always keep this
in front of the window.
She sits here and reads.
She likes the breeze.
She likes the breeze.
She looks beautiful.
And the hair fly on her face.
Why is this cupboard here?
lt should be next
to the dining table.
lt will be a problem for her.
How will she work around here?
How will she work around here?
lt will be a problem.
How will she get the crockery?
How will she get the crockery?
How will she get the crockery?
What are you doing?
Why have you kept everything
at the house
as if she isn't here anymore?
Now, l'll release
both these balls
from the same height
and at the same time.
You've to observe which
ball touches the ground first.
Okay?
Ready.
One. Two. Three.
As you can see
both the balls touched
the ground at the same time.
lt doesn't matter which one
is heavy, or which one isn't?
Okay.
So the same force
pulls them down.
Come on, boys.
Back to your seat. Come on.
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
Careful. Slow down.
All right.
All objects must come down
with a force of gravity
regardless of their mass.
Regardless of their mass.
Sir.
Yeah, Swami!
Sir, can we please see
your tattoo?
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Please, sir.
Just once, sir.
Please, sir.
Good morning.
Look, Mr. fernandes
the bank has already
given you two extensions.
We have no more options left.
Please sir.
We are depending on you.
You know, Jenny and l
have taken up three jobs.
Two months is too less.
Please, sir, do something.
You've been squandering
the money
how can l control it?
See here,
other than the EMl on your home
every month you withdraw
a large amount.
What about that?
Oh yes
your daughter's suffering
from some heart problem.
This is for her treatment,
it cannot be controlled.
And yes, she has a problem
with her kidney
the problem with the heart
seems to be yours.
ln India, fighters are born
outside the ring.
Eveything from drinking water
to kid's school fee
is a fight here.
The guts and rage,
which is the core of a fighter
can be found in evey lane.
Do you have any idea
about the conditions
of the Indian fighters?
For all you know,
the customer care executive
whose call you're tying
to avoid could be an ex-fighter.
Or your insurance agent.
Or maybe your tuition teacher.
Because out here, getting to
the ring itself is a fight.
The bank has already
given you two extensions.
We have no more options le_.
You know, Jenny and l
have taken up three jobs.
Two months is too less.
You've been sauandering
the money
how can l control it.
My daughter's sumering
from a kidney problem.
This is for her treatment,
it cannot be controlled.
Fight.
Fight.
How are you, Gary?
Come on, Monty.
Put yourself in top-gear
and step on the accelerator.
Come on.
They've already bet
35,OOO on you.
Move.
What's Briganza doing here?
- Looking for a fighter.
For some club that he owns.
lt's that important
sport coming to India.
R2F, uncle.
- Yeah! But forget him.
You've got to set
a new record today.
lf you win this,
it'll settle all past scores.
Okay.
Kalubhai.
You're back?
So who's the scapegoat tonight?
Monty, come on.
No more jokes.
Let's go, Monty.
Mr. Gary.
Recognize me?
Pasha.
Fighter Suleiman's son.
How's Suleiman?
He died right here.
Don't be shocked, uncle.
lt's a wound
but nothing to soothe the pain.
Father had to do it
for making ends meet.
Anyway.
l never threw a single punch
but, by God's grace,
l'm more famous than father.
Well my number's up.
ls he your kid?
Then he's going to
rearrange Mustafa's face.
All the best, uncle Gary.
ls that Gary's kid?
Not to worry, Mr. Briganza.
Not every son's like his father.
Keep cool. Don't blow your lid!
Mustafa! Mustafa! Mustafa!
Mustafa! Mustafa! Mustafa!
Mustafa! Mustafa! Mustafa!
Mustafa! Mustafa! Mustafa!
You have to remember the rules
and follow my orders.
Keep your guard on
and step back.
Fighter ready?
Fighter ready?
Fight!
He's throwing punches
in the air, you hit on target.
Guard yourself, Monty.
Monty!
Come on, Monty.
- Don't miss!
Attack, sonny. Attack.
Come on, Monty. Come on.
Hit him! Hit him!
Guard yourself, Monty.
Bravo.
Hit him on the neck!
What are you doing?
Why are you taking a beating?
Aim for his neck.
What are you doing?
Stand up, Monty.
Stand up!
Be gentle. He is one of us!
Monty!
Hold his neck.
Hit him on his ribs. His ribs.
Finish him! Finish him!
Look behind.
Behind you.
Mustafa! Mustafa! Mustafa!
Mustafa! Mustafa! Mustafa!
The swords are still
in the sheaths
we got him with just a knife.
l told you, sir.
My fighter's the real deal.
Sir, compared to him
anyone's better.
Give it, darling.
Mustafa!
Pasha..
He can lose this opportunity
just as easily as he got it.
Competing in the R2F isn't easy.
Make your fighter tough.
- Done.
What must
the people be thinking?
Gay's kid doesn't know
how to fight.
Why were you swinging
your hands around like a joker?
This is not a circus,
lives are lost here.
Yes, l know.
Don't try to teach me.
Hey toughie. Venting
your anger on your father?
What happened to
your anger in the ring?
Your anger was
just like your punch.
Aimless.
Channel your anger, duffer.
Give it direction.
Listen..
Leave that.
Have you lost your mind?
What? Didn't you drink
your entire life?
And what happened to me?
Stamina, strength, patience.
l lost everything.
lt's not so easy
to become a fighter.
That's the difference
between David and you!
You're right.
l can never be like David.
No, Monty, l..
lt's okay, dad.
l've to be somewhere right now.
See you later.
What are you doing in
the middle of the night, David?
l promised Poopoo.
She has to take this project
to school tomorrow.
Talking about Poopoo.
Even after reminding her,
she's missed her dose.
David.
- Hmm.
David.
- Yeah.
David!
What the..
What is this?
Such a big cut. How?
Did you fight again?
Three month's salary
in three hours.
You promised me, David.
Why?
The bank refused any
more extensions on our loan.
l met Tyagi.
We'll find some solution.
Don't do this, David, please.
Jenny, if anything
happens to Poopoo
l will never forgive myself.
lf anything happens
to you, David
l won't forgive you.
Hey, Ganpat. You know
my brother saw one
of our school teachers
fighting at Colaba last night.
What are you saying?
- Which teacher?
My brother doesn't
know his name.
He only recognizes his face.
Of course! Stop lying now.
Honestly.
My brother said he beat him up
and won the fight too.
When will you stop bluffing?
He's got a new story every day.
Good morning, sir.
Look at him..
Ask him.
- What?
Come on.
Sir!
- Yes, Swami.
Did you get wounded
while fighting in Colaba?
Sherlock Homes,
is your zip open since morning?
Come to my office.
After l finish my class.
David, now!
Yes, sir.
You know, David
take some time off
and sort your issues.
Sir, l am trying.
But l can't let you
continue like this.
You come dressed in these
bandages to teach your students.
What will l say
to the management?
The parents?
You know about
my situation, sir.
l do, that's why
l supported you until now.
l know how much
you need this money.
That's why l never
took any extreme step.
David
you are one of my best teachers.
Expelling you isn't easy for me.
But this time..
No problem, sir.
l understand.
Thank you.
Papa, that hurts.
lt's all right dear,
you're a brave girl.
Look at this bird.
lt's flying.. flying.
Sorry, l am late.
- Who's that? Who's that?
Save me.
Oh! It's mom.
What's going on here?
What's going on?
Look here. Look..
Look what's coming.
Wow. Look!
David, your daughter's kidneys
are really weak since birth.
As she grows up, we'll
have to depend on dialysis.
And few years later transplant.
lt's going to be
a tough road ahead, David.
Come, dear.
David..
Jenny, take her inside.
When did you get out of jail?
Few days ago.
l was trying to muster
some courage to meet you.
You made that effort
for no reason.
David, relations can't
be broken so easily.
lt's over.
Now!
You're hurt.
l understand.
l know l am not a good father.
Father?
What father?
Whose son?
l said it's all over.
What happened that night..
lt was a huge mistake.
Your single mistake..
lt ruined my entire life!
ls that my granddaughter?
Na.. Name?
Maria.
Maria Fernandes.
Jenny, please go inside.
You named after my Maria.
l named her after my mother!
David!
Take all the time you want
but you will forgive me someday,
won't you?
The mistake you made
is only worth punishing.
There can be no forgiveness.
Please, David!
Hey!
No! No!
Hey!
How dare you touch him?
How dare you touch him?
Monty! No!
How dare you touch him?
How dare you touch him?
- Monty, no!
Get lost.
- How dare you touch him?
Get lost.
Get lost!
How dare you touch him?
- Go away, get lost.
How dare you touch him?
- Get out! Take him too.
How dare you touch him?
Sorry, David.
We're leaving.
How dare you touch father!
No, Monty.
- How dare you touch father!
No, Monty. Let's go.
No, he didn't touch me.
How dare he touch you!
l love you so much.
You know Maria.
l don't deserve you, Maria.
l ruined
our entire family, Maria.
How do l tell you..
l destroyed our family.
- Hey, dad.
No, no, no.
- Dad, you are hurt.
Get up! What are you doing?
- No.
David doesn't forgive me either.
Will you forgive me?
Will you forgive me?
Right. Right?
Enough.. Enough..
What are you doing?
You're a bad man, Garson.
What are you doing? Stop?
- You're a bad man!
l will kill you.
You destroyed the family!
My son hates me!
My son hates me!
Leave me.
No, dad.
- Leave me.
l'll kill you!
- No..
My son hates me!
My son hates me!
My family.
l destroyed my family!
l destroyed my family!
My family.
David named his daughter
after you.
He kept you alive, Maria.
Maria.
What do you think this is, Gary?
Maria, l admit it's my mistake.
Sarah is no more now.
But what about this kid now?
l am his father.
This is not an orphanage.
So what if his mother's dead?
Speak softly. He doesn't know.
Why? Why do l speak softly?
l am not that great, Gary.
Be quiet, Maria.
Come in.
Don't be scared, come in.
What's wrong?
lt's my birthday today.
l want to go home.
Mom must be waiting for me.
Come with me.
Can l keep your bag
and pillow there?
Happy birthday!
Pass.
Robin!
Monty, quickly. Quickly.
Pass, Robin..
- Pass.
Here, here.
You bastard..
Who did you call a bastard?
David, leave him.
David.
David, leave him.
David, leave him.
David, leave him.
So what happened today?
What's your problem?
They call me
every day to school.
Why did you hit
those boys today?
How dare
they call him bastard!
He's family.
Well done..
Well done.
- Dad.
Well done, young man.
Well done.
Dad!
What?
Practice.
Practice. Come on.
Don't try to teach me!
Happy.. Happy birthday!
- Happy Birthday!
l am so sorry, darling.
l'm.. l'm sorry.
l am sorry.
Sorry, baby. l am so sorry.
- It's okay.
l destroyed everything.
lt's okay.
lt's okay, Gary.
lt's okay.
- l am sorry.
No. My love.
l am sorry.
l destroyed everything.
l am sorry.
- It's okay, Gary.
lt's okay.
l am so sorry, Sarah.
l am so sorry.
l am so sorry, Sarah.
Sarah..
Maria!
Maria.. Maria,
l am sorry, Maria.
Maria.. l am sorry.
You finished
everything today, Gary.
This was the only thing left
for you to do.
You addressed me
by that woman's name.
You mentioned that woman's name
in front of the kids.
Forget it..
lt was a mistake.
Mistake?
Mistake?
You cheated on me,
was that a mistake?
You brought someone else's
kid home. Was that a mistake?
Forget it. What's done is done.
How many more mistakes
are you going to make, Gary?
l am fed up.
l'm tired of putting up
with your mistakes.
Stop screaming.
You're making a scene
in front of the boys.
So be it!
So be it!
Let them find out as well.
- Quiet!
l am trying to be their mother!
l am trying to save this family,
not you!
No one forced you!
Stop asserting!
l am asserting!
l am asserting!
l am suffering because of you!
What suffering?
l am still with you.
She's dead.
l should've left you
and stayed with her instead.
Mom!
Maria! Maria!
Maria!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom, get up. Get up.
Carefully.
Careful.
Mom..
Mom..
Stay back!
Stay back!
Don't touch my mother!
This happened because of you!
Mom!
Get up, mom.
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Mom..
Mustafa! Mustafa!
Mustafa! Mustafa!
Your boy has got guts,
uncle Gary.
Did you have enough fun
getting my son
beaten up last time?
You pit the same fighter
against him.
Kalubhai, is there some problem
between father and son?
l didn't pit Mustafa against
your boy, he challenged him.
He asked for this fight.
Fighter ready?
Fighter ready?
Fight!
Come on.
Come on.
Well done..
Mustafa!
- Come on. .
Come on.
Get up, Mustafa! Get up!
Yes.
Mustafa, get up!
Well done!
Get up!
Mustafa!
- Stay down.
What are you staring at, dad?
You said l should give direction
to my anger.
l did just that.
Do you know who l saw
in the ring today?
David!
Monty! You made me proud today.
You're just like your father.
We're going to celebrate today.
We're going to celebrate.
Your son has won.
l'm going to get drunk today.
You quit, but we'll
definitely have a drink.
Look at Pasha's face.
You're talking about R2F.
Mustafa can't even go
to the bathroom.
Doctor.
He's got two broken ribs.
His jaw is dislocated.
- Please try.
Are you even listening?
But..
- You're a strange man.
Darn you..
Mary is here! Come on.
Come.
Come..
Mary is here..
You made me laugh
even in my grief!
Give me one chance.
Master, this is not
some local fight of Colaba.
lt's R2F.
Forget it, David.
With a wife and kid,
you've become a family-man now.
Pasha!
Please.
Pakiya.
- Yes, Pasha sir.
How educated are you?
Fifth grade.
Come on.
Time to complete your education.
l give you a chance.
The world's very cruel, Master.
lt laughs at your pain.
Wonde_ul, Master.
You're tiring up the enemy.
So how do you all like the logo?
The king of all sports is here.
Thanks to you, bloodshed
will now be legal, sir.
ls it right to legalize
these street fights?
Street fights?
Just because you don't
understand some technical sport
you will dishonor it, won't you?
Madam, we didn't
Iegalize murder.
lt's not a crime.
What you call street fights
is actually mixed martial arts.
Do you know anything about it?
Clearly, you've no idea
how many trained kick-boxers
and kung fu experts
starved to death.
There's a revolution
coming to India.
A revolution.
We've seen wrestlers
and boxers
and now we'll see fighters.
Fighters.
Kalubhai, that was
such an easy shot.
Even a_er numerous oppositions
the government grants approval.
lnternational Fighting
Championship R2F
is coming to India.
Do you feel this tournament
will change the destiny
of Indian fighters?
Of course!
Thanks to R2F, fighters
won't just make g_ money.
ln fact,
they have an oppo_unity
to leave a mark in histoy.
l told you
l will talk to Briganza.
But Monty, it's not that easy.
Thankfully, you guys..
Hello.
David, where are you
since morning?
Listen, l had a word with
Briganza and he agreed.
Master, you've been selected
for R2F! - Who is it?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello, David?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello.
Did you hear what l said?
David, l've been trying
your cell phone for so long.
Where are you?
Yes, Pasha.
Briganza said yes, David.
Congratulations, buddy.
Congratulations.
Pasha, l'll call you back.
Jenny, l was going to tell you..
This isn't your decision alone.
lt could've been ours.
But since you've
already decided.
Don't be weak.
And remember one thing.
Poopoo and l are
always with you.
But when you enter the ring
you have to fight alone.
Sorry, Jenny.
l am sorry, David.
l can't watch you
fight this time.
Not this time.
Look.
Now that's a real roughneck.
l'm going to pitch this brawler
against those
international fighters
who will make it difficult
for them to breath.
Thank you.
Yes, it's confirmed.
Our government has decided
to bring Right 2 Fight in India.
The first tournament of R2F
will take place in Mumbai.
Sir, R2F is banned in most
of the countries of the world.
From US to UK, Germany
and in many European countries
R2F is a popular spo_.
So let it remain a spo_, and
don't give it any other name.
David.
Come on. Come up.
This tournament will make more
money than any cricket league.
lt's a money spinner.
That's my challenge.
Mr. Briganza, will you find
fighters in India
up to that level?
No..
l'll find better!
A country with
billion people and what
10 world-class sportsmen,
give or take.
And now by sanctioning R2F,
you mean to say
these street-fighters
will compete
with international fighters.
Haven't you seen
gully-cricket players
in National cricket teams?
Almost evey
Indian spo_s champion
came from the streets, ma'am.
Ex-fighter Mr. Baaz Rawat feels
very strongly for the R2F.
l don't agree
with Mr. Baaz Rawat.
Our county needs spo_s
that involves strategy
and mental power.
Brain power is the main power,
you see.
What do you think
this is all about?
We fight with our brains, sir.
lf your brain doesn't
co-ordinate with the hand
then it's all over.
Strategy, reflex, co-ordination
one n_s all that in this game.
You got to think on your feet,
or you're dead.
Peter, will it go?
Will it go?
lt's already gone.
The entire country's
talking about
is the Indian fighting
scene up to the mark?
You're forgetting, Mr. Desai.
This county is
a Mecca for fighters.
And such excitement for
a brand new spo_, it's ama2ing.
Then what are you waiting for?
Right here, right now
declare it on our channel.
The names of India's
R2F fighters.
Be patient.
This is India's first
ma_ial a_ event.
There must be some suspense
before the action sta_s.
Mr. Peter Briganza's office has
refused to confirm or deny this
but we've found out
through our sources
that Germany's heavyweight
champion, The Great Luca
is coming to India.
lf this is true,
then Luca's presence
has truly made this
an international tournament.
That's fantastic.
l've seen Luca fight.
He's gruesome.
He's vey-vey dangerous.
David. Look.
So end of discussion.
This competition is over
even before it started.
You're saying this because
the Great Luca never fought
any Indian fighter before.
This will be a fight
to the finish.
Mr. Briganza, why such secrecy
regarding the fighters names?
Come on, man.
A little bit of drama
is good in any sport.
Not just you, but even
these fighters will know
who they will be
facing in the ring.
So the first Indian
R2F's first fighter is.
The North Indian Superstar.
Wrestler Gama.
Peter Briganza has
revealed his first fighter!
R2F will be a new
challenge for Gama.
Gama won the Bronze Medal
for India in the 2009 Olympics.
The Hammer from Italy!
He's got a really bad
reputation in the MMA World.
Rana Singh Hooda. - And
he makes no bones about it.
Ronny Cross from Brazil.
2010's highest paid MMA fighter
and has also won three
championships worldwide.
The next fighter of
the evening is Tenzin Yana.
Tenzin Yana from China
is the only Shaolin Fighter in
this championship. - Max Potter.
Our next fighter is someone
whose single video created a
huge sensation on the internet.
Monty Fernandes.
And he's one of the most
notorious fighters
of this tournament.
Monty, a leaked
video of your fight
has made you an overnight viral
sensation over the internet.
How does it feel
to be recognized?
Monty Fernandes is
backed by his father
ex-fighter Garson Fernandes.
This is R2F's one
and only father-son team.
Only on R_f
can a school teacher
compete against national
and international fighters
in the ring.
David Fernandes.
And this is the tournament's
wild card entry
the underdog David Fernandes.
You auit your teaching job
to make a fulltime
career in MMA.
Seriously?
Do you even dese_e
to be on this platform?
l don't know whether
l deserve it or not.
But my family
definitely deserves this chance.
And coming up next is
this tournament's star.
Straight from
Hitler's country.
Made in Germany.
R2F's most gruesome champion.
Luca.
The Great Luca's come
to India for the first time.
And the betting market's really
on a roll with this fighter.
Luca never won any fight
in a tap-out.
lt has always been a knockout.
Fought 30 fights.
won 24 and disqualified from 6.
And caused one death.
Luca's either been throw out,
or won every fight he's fought.
Mr. Briganza hasn't made any
compromises for this tournament.
He's brought every well-known
and infamous fighter
to this tournament.
This is the Right 2 Fight.
The ACs and fans
in this room are working.
Still the temperature of
this place is rising.
lt's a power-packed room.
One thing l can promise you.
This will be the most exciting
thrilling and dangerous ride
of your life.
l've full faith that
this tournament
is going to be a block-buster.
Look, mom.
The Eauinox Arena is
going to explode tonight.
Mumbai is about to witness
the bl_iest battle ever.
A spo_ or a war.
What in the name of hell is R2F?
Ten world class fighters.
One fighting cage.
Ten deadly rounds.
One fearless champion
who will win the jackpot
of 90 million.
The next 48 hours is going
to be the most dangerous.
Ten worst men in the world are
ready to rip each other apa_.
This is the Indian R2F.
Hi, l am Baaz Rawat.
Ex-wrestling coach for
the Common Wealth Federation.
And this is Sachin Mehra, sports
journalist in a leading daily.
Thank you for the
introduction, Baaz.
l still can't believe
this is actually happening.
l mean, l followed the R2F
internationally since l was 18
and now everyone follows it.
Right 2 Fight is in India, Baaz.
Well, you have
Mr. Peter Briganza to thank
who brought this popular
international sport to India.
And gave a huge platform
to undercover fights.
Well, l am telling you,
this is going to be the biggest
martial art spectacle
the country has ever seen.
90 million.
Mr. Briganza's masterstroke
will change the destiny
of Indian fighters.
Absolutely.
And not just the Indian fighters
in fact the entire
Indian fighting scene.
l mean, just
Iook around here, Sachin.
This is Mahabharata reloaded.
This is epic!
What's this?
Where did you get this?
You worked so hard to get here.
Do you want to ruin everything?
lf any officials spot you
they will disqualify you
from the tournament.
Get that? Do you understand
what l'm saying?
You want to fight, don't you?
You want to fight, right?
Fight starts in 5 minutes.
- Yeah, yeah thanks.
Thank you.
Come on, boy.
You gotta fight.
You gotta fight.
You gotta fight, man.
Get up!
- Ladies and Gentlemen.
Right 2 Fight India presents
the first fighter
of the evening.
Monty Fernandes.
Come on, guys. Come gather
around. Monty's coming up.
This is the moment.
Because this is R2F's
first battle-cy.
People often
applaud for the hero
but today the place will
resonate for the biggest villain
and here he comes.
Monty Fernandes.
Monty Fernandes
has already created
a viral fever over the internet.
But this is the acid test.
Because this is Monty's debut
on the international Arena.
Well, we can't predict
the future, Baaz
but Monty's past
is very interesting.
He was raised in
a local church of Mumbai.
Monty never filled his
mother's name on any form.
And his father, who's
incidentally his trainer as well
recently returned after serving
time for killing his mother
and l hope that
angst works for him.
l certainly hope so
because he already
has a huge fan following.
But no walkout music
nO SpOnSOrS
nor media interviews.
ln fact, for him
rules are meant to be broken.
Bad boy and who
doesn't love a bad boy.
This fight isn't going
to be easy for Monty Fernandes.
His first fight is with
the No_h Indian Champion Gama.
And trust me Gama can rock
Monty's alpha and beta.
All that l am saying Baaz,
this is the R2F
and anything can happen here.
And whatever happens, will
happen right here, right now.
Let's get set for the face-off.
- And tonight's second fighter
is the pride of Punjab.
the Great Gama.
Gama. Gama. Gama.
Will this be an easy fight
for Champion Gama?
Well, seems like it.
Gama! Gama! Gama! Gama!
This is called star power,
Sachin.
Absolutely.
Everyone is going mad.
Gama! Gama! Gama! Gama!
Gama! Gama! Gama! Gama!
Gama! Gama! Gama! Gama!
Gama! Gama! Gama! Gama!
Gary. .
Come on, Gary.
Have faith in your son.
l'm scared because
he's just a kid.
They are all trained
international fighters.
And Monty..
You trained him, didn't you?
Now put a brake on your emotions
and let him take
the driver's seat.
Monty! Monty! Come on!
Monty! Monty! Monty!
The stage is set.
The audience is roaring.
We're moments away from
R2F India's first fight.
Gentlemen, you know the rules.
l expect a clean fight.
Obey my commands at all times.
Protect yourselves at all times.
Touch gloves and
go back to your corners.
Monty Fernandes
entered this quagmire
but can he get out.
A winner.
Let's find out.
l hope the audience
don't get off their seats
and into the ring.
They have every right, Baaz.
The right to scream.
The right to hate.
The right to win.
Because this is
the Right 2 Fight.
Fighter, are you ready?
Fighter, are you ready?
Let's fight.
And the bull has been flagged.
There goes Gama.
Knocked out in one punch.
What was that?
This is not done!
What just happened?
What was that?
Ladies and gentlemen
now that's what you
call a battle-cry.
Monty Fernandes has knocked out
North Indian Champion Gama.
Monty has won.
- Monty! Monty! Monty!
Well, we still can't believe it,
but this is real.
Gama is out of the ring
and the tournament.
Baa2, on any given day
one single mistake can cause
even the biggest champion
to be disaualified.
Gama has been knocked
out of the R2F.
Reason, Monty Fernandes.
Hello, dear.
Papa, you're not coming
to the hospital tomorrow?
Sorry, dear. Papa's got
something urgent to attend to.
But l promise,
next time l'll be there.
But l never came here
without you.
l am scared.
lmpossible.
My Poopoo is the bravest.
Braver than mama,
braver than papa.
Five minutes.
Okay, baby.
Papa has to go now.
Will you pray for me?
Yes, l will pray for you.
Will you pray for me?
Always, dear.
Papa loves you.
Bye.
Swami, come quickly.
- Hold on, man.
Move aside.
Peter Brigan2a
had hardly any time
to find a replacement
for Mustafa Sayyed.
That's when he chose a teacher.
That's David who quit his job
as a physics teacher
to step into the ring and
become a full-time MMA fighter.
Worries only tie
down a fighter, David.
This is your opportunity.
Take your chance
and free yourself.
Come on, let's kill it.
Where are you going?
You can't go in.
He's my son.
All the best.
Well, Baaz. l guess the physics
of David's mind
was definitely off
which is why he came here.
And tonight there's no guarantee
what's going to happen to
the biology of his body.
You know, Baa2,
when l found out about David
l got him a gi_.
501 home remedies.
ln other words, local remedies.
He'll surely find a remedy
for broken bones in here.
Come on, Sachin.
lf David made it this far
then there must
be something about him.
l've seen him in
some local MMA fights.
Yes, Baaz,
those memorable fights
which only you remember.
Cheeky bugger.
David the Teacher will be facing
Brazilian heavyweight champion
Ronnie Cross.
Because Ronnie prepared
for the world cup
but today he has
to play gully-cricket.
From Mustafa Sayyed
to this teacher.
Come on, Master.
Class starts..
Hurry up,
the fight's about to start.
Gentlemen, you know the rules.
l expect a clean fight.
Obey my commands at all times.
Protect yourselves at all times.
Touch gloves and
go back to your corners.
Help us, God.
Fighter, are you ready?
Time to aim
for the grace, David!
Let's fight.
Breathe, Master.
Footwork. Use your footwork.
Lock him.
Get out of his grip!
Get out of it, David.
l think it's almost over.
Ronnie has tightened
his grip around David.
You're right, Baaz.
l don't think this teacher
has any more answers.
This class won't last
for long now.
Get out of it, David. Get out.
The last 10 seconds
have kicked in.
Don't tap out, Master.
Just 10 seconds more.
The end is near. l don't think
David's going to the next round.
David's blood is drying up.
He's turning blue, l can see it.
5 seconds, Master!
l can't believe
he's still holding on.
l mean that just
takes some grit.
The Teacher has survived.
This is the R2F.
Baaz, this is it.
Amazing, l am so happy for him.
He survived.
Lovely. Lovely.
Sit down.
Sit down. Sit down.
- l should have got him.
Magnificent! Ronnie realized
he's facing a worthy champion.
Keep at it, David.
Keep at it.
You're the man!
Buck up.
Come on, Master.
Yeah!
David just gave Ronnie
an upper cut.
Ronnie is in big trouble.
Baaz, seems like David teaching
a tough lesson
to his errant student.
l think Ronnie's summer vacation
is about to begin.
Get him in your grip!
And it's actually
happened, Baaz.
lt's a miracle.
l can't believe it.
The Physics Teacher
has defeated Ronnie Cross.
And l can't believe
l am saying this
but David is in the
next round of the R2F.
Ronnie is out of the tournament.
Pasha Ali has hugged
his fighter. - David has won!
What happened?
- What are you doing inside?
David has won.
David snatched this victory
straight out of Ronnie's hands.
David used a
simple technical finish today.
Maybe the experience
of an ex-fighter.
Technical finish and
experience is fine, Baaz.
But such flukes
don't happen every day.
This is no fluke, Sachin.
It's the want!
lt's the want to win!
A fighter's want is
the formula for his victory.
Whether this is a fluke or want,
only time will tell.
But for now
David beats Ronnie.
Sachin, l think
you should give that
501 Home Remedy book to Ronnie.
Cheeky bugger.
Yeah!
Yes!
Two fighters have been
eliminated from R2F
and the third one
faces a life threat.
Because he'll be facing
deadly Luca from Germany.
This is ridiculous.
That was really quick.
The Great Luca has proved
that he hunts fighters.
l can't believe it.
I am sure you guys
are shocked as we are.
Luca's next dinner
will be tomorrow evening.
But there's lot
more coming tonight.
The fourth fight
of this glorious night.
The Italian Hammer Vs.
the Hariyanvi Hooda.
From Italy's jail
to R2F's ring.
Hammer is justifying
his name with evey hit.
And just a knee-knock
to finish it all om.
ltaly's ex-criminal
has knocked out
lndian fighter Rana Singh H_a.
Monty. Monty. Monty. Monty.
Monty. Monty. Monty. Monty.
Look at him, man.
Just look at him.
Baaz, l think the crowd
has found their villain.
Monty Fernandes.
lf you look at Monty,
it seems like
he's waiting for the next fight,
and not applause.
Fighter, are you ready?
Fighter, are you ready?
Let's fight.
He didn't wait for
the referee's announcement
or celebrate his victory.
To hell with the rulebook.
Monty is out of the cage.
Out of the cage.
and in the top four, Baaz.
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Once again the underdog,
David the Teacher.
Teacher has cleared
the first round.
By a fluke.
But now he's facing the
Shaolin fighter, Tenzin Yana.
He's deadly.
He's called the Tooth Fairy.
He has broken
the teeth of 7 fighters.
Let's fight!
Come on, David!
Come on, David!
Get out of there.
Come on, David.
Come on, David, block.
What are you doing, David?
Follow the plan. Attack.
He will kill you.
Let him get a little more tired.
Sit down and watch David fight.
- l've so much work left to do.
Round 3 is about to begin and
Tenzin is already drained, Baaz.
David's fight begins now,
Sachin.
Come on!
Baaz, David has gone crazy.
He's venting his anger
out on Tenzin.
lt's his technique, Sachin.
Many fighters came and went
but we don't often get to
see such a brilliant game plan.
And l can see David
is a master of technique.
Did you hear that crunch?
Yes!
Yeah, David! Yeah..
David has won!
With every fight
this tournament's
getting more dangerous.
David.
Sachin, once can be a fluke
but twice means
he's a trump card.
Baaz, even l feel l should
be betting on this ace.
Champion's knocked out,
the underdog wins.
This is Safari Storm
presents R2F.
Well, l am sure the audience
needs some recovery time
from what they've seen tonight.
So take your recovery time.
Because that is it for tonight.
Tomorrow night,
same time, same place.
Keep watching R2F.
See you tomorrow night then.
Last night the city of Mumbai
ech_ with a resounding uproar.
The first night of
the first ever Indian R2F
culminated at Eauinox arena.
And as expected
it was a knockout.
You lose one, you lose them all.
Six out of ten international
fighters bit the dust.
And the four who remain
one shall adorn the belt of
the first Indian R2F Champion.
So as moon rises and
the wolves step into the arena
it's time to ready
for a bl_y battle.
Secretly in the dark
and in the betting markets
and right under
the noses of the police.
local street fights
were always viewed
as a crime in this country.
But tonight this sport is
about to get a new recognition.
lndia's about to get
its new R2F champion.
The first semi-final is between
the German hit-machine, Luca
and India's Monster Monty.
Baaz, this is the sound of doom.
This dangerous music
is the indication
of the upcoming storm.
And it's called the Great Luca.
This is as big as it gets.
l mean look at Luca's size.
He's four times
bigger than Monty.
Luca. Luca. Luca. Luca.
Luca. Luca. Luca.
l know Monty is a monster, but..
But this guy's a man-eater.
So Sachin,
it's the pre-final war.
And l think Monty's
been great so far.
Have you heard about
Luca's one punch challenge?
He claims to knock Monty out
with a single punch.
l hope Monty will
answer that in the ring.
Are you crazy? Have
you ever seen Luca's fights?
l mean my bet's safely on him.
He has a reputation.
Monty has the madness.
- Luca's the expert.
Monty has raw talent.
- Oh come on, Baaz.
Monty doesn't
have any technique.
Luca. Luca.
Luca. Luca. Luca. Luca.
Luca. Luca. Luca. Luca.
Luca. Luca. Luca. Luca.
Luca. Luca. Luca. Luca.
Luca. Luca.
Ladies and gentlemen,
R2F's biggest knockout.
Luca is not moving!
Got him, bro! You got him, bro!
You got him!
He came, he won and he left.
Experience, technique.
all that didn't matter.
Just by the way, if this fight
was taking place
on the streets of Mumbai
then Monty would've
been in jail.
Sachin, the truth is this
isn't the streets of Mumbai
nor is Monty a criminal.
This is the Right 2 Fight.
And Monty Fernandes
is the first finalist
of the first Indian R2F.
Before coming to R2F
David remained the underdog
and within no time,
he's in the final four.
Maybe that's why so far
he's the hero of the tournament.
No wonder.
Such applause can only
be expected at a hero's entry.
Master, someone's here
to see you.
Hammer!
And that's the Hammer.
Justifying his name
and his actions.
The most deranged
fighter of R2F.
What's interesting
is that last year
in the international fighting
championship
Hammer lost to Luca
and was eliminated.
Tonight he'll seek
revenge from David.
Don't spare him, David.
Fighter, are you ready?
Fighter, are you ready?
Fight.
Keep him away, David.
Breathe in, Master!
Don't give him a chance.
Come on, David!
Come on, David!
What a punch!
Take him to the ground.
Lock his legs.
That's it.
David is back and how.
Now that's a fight
to the finish.
Who would want to get up
from their seats
from a semifinal like this?
And it's g_ news for
the fans of David. - Hello..
He's back on the attack.
David!
That shook the entire arena.
But David won't forgive
Hammer's mistake.
Yes!
Get the bugger..
David.
Pull him back!
Come on, son. Come on, son.
Come on, son. Get him!
David.
Kick him back, David.
Kick him back!
Uncle Gary, are you okay?
Darn you..
David's on attack mode
for the first time on R2F.
To hell with defense.
lt's like something gotten
into David.
This is not even his style.
He's going full out.
Hammer has literally given up.
But l don't think David
will let him leave in one piece.
ls this fight getting personal?
David is giving him
no chance to move.
Clearly there's
blood on his mind.
But for now it's David
that's on Hammer's head.
That's it, my son.
That's it!
He's done it, my boy.
He did it!
The Teacher smashed him.
l can't believe it.
David, a physics teacher,
a common man!
What has he done?
The impossible.
The crowd is going mad!
ls this happening for real?
That's it. That's it. That's it.
The first finalists
of the Indian R2F.
Monty Vs. David!
Monty Vs. David!
This fight is going
to be noted in textbooks.
lt's the final. Fight to finish.
One of them will win the title
of India's first R2F Champ.
Who's going to win
the 90 million cash pri2e?
Monty or David?
Baaz, this is going to be
one hell of a battle.
l've waited so long
for this day.
Did you hear what he said?
Monty Vs. David?
Monty Vs. David?
What happened, dad?
l get it.
You don't want this fight.
You don't want me
to fight David.
What worries you?
Will something happen to me?
Or him?
You're worried for David.
You should be worried
for him, dad.
You should be worried..
What?
- Yes.
Ladies and gentlemen, we just
got our hands on a piece of news
which will tap
all of you out totally.
R2F's high voltage action drama
has taken the most
dramatic turn.
Ever!
This never happened
in the histoy. .
What are they talking about?
- l don't know.
...of World Fighting
Championship before.
Our finalists.
David and Monty Fernandes
are actually
brothers!
They are brothers?
- What?
David.
l've decided.
l'll fight him.
You know, l just realized.
This R2F has become Maha R2F.
Because just like
the Mahabharata
this is a battle
between two brothers again.
lt's going to be
a tough fight, Sachin.
For both, David and Monty.
l hope emotion doesn't inte_ere
with their passion for victory.
Baaz, l guess this is just as
shocking for them
as it is for us.
They've been through so many
fights to get to the finals.
Now do they even want
to step into the ring?
David! David! David! David!
Last bout, Master.
Don't let relations come in
between victory and defeat.
There couldn't have been
a bigger dream finale
for the first R2F.
l am sure the audiences
will be confused tonight
as to whom
they should cheer for.
But Baa2, spare a thought
for Garson Fernandes.
He could've never imagined
he'll be seeing this day.
There's no 'Deewaar'
(Wall) here. It's a ring.
Neither Amitabh
nor Shashi Kapoor.
lt's Monty and David.
So tonight,
on the first finals of R2F
it's two brothers thirsty
for each other's bl_.
Fighter, are you ready?
Fighter, are you ready?
Let's fight.
Get out of there, David.
Come on. Get up!
David!
Come, Monty.
Come on.
Come.
Will David seek revenge
for this round
by attacking in the next round?
Or will Monty come
back with more aggression?
l am sure no one in this arena
has witnessed
something like this.
Keep at it. Just continue.
You will win.
He's coming at you with full
strength, just like we wanted.
Follow the rules.
Get that.
- Now turn it around.
Hit back. Finish him off.
lf you break the rules,
you'll be disqualified.
Look at me!
He's not your brother.
He's just an obstruction
in your path to victory.
All the best.
Let's fight.
David!
Careful.
David, what are you doing?
Hey.
Back to your corner.
Hey referee, don't you know
what's a cheap blow?
Monty, sit.
You're doing well.
What are you doing, David?
Have some water.
This is a world competition
not your home.
How many chances are
you going to give him?
Stop toying with him, hit back.
Monty! Monty! Monty! Monty!
Monty! Monty! Monty! Monty!
Monty! Monty! Monty! Monty!
Monty! Monty! Monty! Monty!
Monty! Monty! Monty!
Monty! Monty! Monty!
Monty! Monty! Monty! Monty!
Bravo.
No!
This is a turn around.
The Teacher just
unleashed a new move.
What have you done, David?
Wonde_ul, David.
Monty!
Monty.
Gary, look at what
your sons are doing?
Relax.
- l broke his shoulder.
l heard it myself.
Get up, son..
Careful. .
l heard it myself.
His shoulder's broken.
So you did. Now break his
other shoulder too.
Don't mix emotions
with fighting.
David.
David.
- Look at me.
David. - Is this why
you worked so hard?
lt's all my fault, David.
- A fighter has no rules, David.
l am sorry. l am sorry, David.
- He only concern is winning.
David! David!
lt's my fault, David.
l am sorry, David.
No.. - So many fighters
died in the ring.
Don't listen to him!
- It's time to decide, David!
Fighter, you have
the right to fight.
Do you wish to continue?
He's your brother.
- You're close to winning
and suddenly you see
your brother in him.
You broke his arm.
He's your brother.
You broke his arm.
Stop it, David. Stop.
You may continue.
This is incredible.
Monty's ready to
fight with one arm.
He wants to fight with
a bloody broken shoulder.
He doesn't want to quit.
Baaz, in this ring you
either die or never say die.
Fighter, are you ready?
Fighter, are you ready?
Let's fight!
Stop it. Stop it, Monty.
l can't hurt you anymore.
Stop it.
You can, David.
You can hurt me all you want.
Because you're selfish.
You only think about yourself.
Did you ever think about me?
What happened to me after that?
How could you forget
she was my mother too?
l am sorry, Monty.
l am sorry, Monty.
l am sorry.
l am sorry, Monty.
Sorry.
Ladies and Gentlemen, R2F
has found its first champion.
The underdog, the Teacher.
David Fernandes is
now the Master of MMA.
The crowd is going mad!
