This is...
the way he runs.
The way he runs, I've seen it before,
headed to our secret base.
Together with Jintan, Anaru, Yukiatsu
Tsuruko, Poppo,
and Menma.
Together to our Super Peace Buster Secret Base.
Ji-Jintan?!
Guys!
Ji-
Menma? Menma! Menma!
Hey, Jintan!
What's wrong?
Don't tell me.
Don't tell me Menma is...
No way!
Jintan...
Menma!
What is it?
Where are you?
Hurry and come out! Menma!
Menma! Menma!
Calm down, Jintan!
Menma!
What's going on?!
Menma!
I-It's hide and seek.
What do you mean by hide and seek?
Jintan, is she playing hide and seek?
Hey, Menma!
Hide and seek?
Oi, Jintan!
Wait!
Menma!
Hey, let's go too!
Y-Yeah!
Let's go!
Okay
Not yet...
Not yet...
Menma still hasn't... said goodbye properly.
Menma!
Not yet...
Not yet...
Alright, there!
Eh? Then, I'll...
Hey, Poppo, this spot is mine!
Hee...
This spot is mine, okay?
Are you done hiding?
Not yet!
Are you done hiding?
Jintan...
It's okay!
It's okay!
Menma...
sometimes feels strange.
Ouch!
Poppo, got you.
Right now, Menma feels like playing with everyone.
Anaru, found you.
Hee!
Character\h\h\h\h\h\h\h
Total medals\h
Total Nokemon\h\h\h\h
Duration
At first,
Menma didn't have any friends to share games.
Spring Camp.
Every group leader has been determined,
now everyone choose which group you want.
If you want to join come here.
It's not fair!
Go with me!
Menma can't be with the others.
That's what Menma thought all this time.
Because Menma is...
just like a Nokemon.
Eh?
You come with our team.
Team?
The first Nokemon I got from trading was
Connecting
Please don't unplug the cable
Viviton.
Congratulation!
You've got Viviton!
Okay, Done.
Isn't it unfair?
What is?
It isn't fair if you got Jaguras, and Menma got Viviton
Jintan unfair!
Don't lie to her.
N-No! This is...
It's okay.
M-Menma doesn't mind getting a Viviton.
Really?
Yeah.
You guys heard that?
Yeah, as long Menma doesn't mind.
Because Viviton's ability is
dancing with everyone.
"Everyone" means
Alright! Let's make this our secret base!
Not something lined up and hardened like a dango.
But more like a grain of rice,
one by one gathered together,
then starting to boil and becoming warm rice.
That's what "everyone" means to Menma.
So...
Tsuruko, found you.
Ah... Tsuruko too easy.
But I made sure to be hard to find.
All that's left are Jintan and Menma.
Hey, if it's Jintan, he must be hiding inside, right?
But inside it's dark and too cramped.
If it's Jintan, he'll still do it.
It's bad!
Yeah, it's true.
Ah!
It's them!
Damn!
Jintan, Menma, found you!
Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai.
A Letter to Menma
What am I, an elementary schooler?
Yes, what is it, Tsuruko?
Eh? Yeah, at six right?
Oh yeah, have you finished the letter?
Amazing! Nothing less from you.
I don't know what to write.
There are many things you want to say to Menma, right?
Yeah, that's true...
Ah.
That's wrong.
What?
Not "want,"
but things you "must" to say to Menma.
Right?
L-Like what?
Think of it yourself.
Eh?
Well then, see you at six.
Wa-
Damn.
Tsuruko's acting all mature.
Important stuff.
Dear Anaru, I love how steady you are.
I love him.
I love him so much.
Eh? But...
It's like, we're trying to hurt him.
You are curious, right?
I am, but...
Still...
You love Jintan, right?
Ah?
Right.
I've always loved Jintan.
Hey, Jintan.
What?
You like Menma, right?
Eh?
Eh!?
W-What, are you saying?
Just answer it.
Because Super Peace Busters don't need to hide a secret.
Yukiatsu!
Say it! Say it! Say it!
Jeez, don't be like that.
Say it! Say it!
Say it! Say it!
Who'd like this ugly...
Hey, wait Jintan!
Jintan!
That day Menma left,
and my words can't reach her.
Words that can't reach,
Words that can't be spoken.
Words that I keep inside.
That is...
Excuse me!
Nokemon please!
Oh, it's the last one!
Lucky!
That was close!
Total 4,800 Yen
E-Eh? It's 4,800 Yen!
You must have mistaken 8 with 0!
Ah, I wouldn't have bought a juice if I knew it would be like this.
What will you do?
Woah, that's Nokemon.
Hey, hey, what will you do?
You'd buy that?
Sorry, could you wait a moment? I'll go get more money.
Excuse me.
Do you still have Nokemon?
I-I...
Sorry, it's sold out.
Aw, that's too bad.
It's rare after all.
Hurry and get the rest.
I'll give you one hour.
Yeah!
Good for you!
He is a good guy.
You think I'm a good person?
Damn brat!
Yadomi-kun.
You can take a break.
Oh, thank you. Then I'll go ahead.
Menma, how are you?
It feels strange to ask your condition.
After that event, I started to go to school. Even if not everyday.
But still, it's better than before.
One day, I got invited by some seniors to karaoke.
That was the first time I had gone to a place like that.
Singing in front of everyone, it was embarrassing.
Who's next?
Oh, it's me.
Everyone singing their souls out
when the list doesn't have many choices.
How do I put it? I'm nothing compared to them.
Even if it's just karaoke, it's still a bit too much.
Yeah.
I can enjoy many great things.
It's all because of you.
At first, I was always stubborn
and looked down on others.
Until you appeared.
No way, that can't be it.
That's not what I meant.
But hey, your breast are definitely bigger.
Die!
That's a bit gross, but...
Die!
But...
Die!
Die!
Die! Die!
Die! Die! Die! Die!
Don't leave behind any of your inferior DNA!
Damn pervert!
Eh?
Is that Building Builder?
It's not.
Women really are simple-minded.
Eh? But it's similar...
Look, its lips are so thick.
If that's your reasoning, then the old man at the Abacus school is also one...
Hmm... But still, Jintan...
Eh? Jintan?
Jintan?
The beast of summer is really ferocious.
Ah, no fair! Menma wants Shio Ramen too!
Ah, an egg!
Menma wants egg soup, egg soup!
Hey...
The egg is going to get hard.
Mix the egg! Mix it! Mix it!
Having ramen?
Sounds nice. Jinta, make some for me.
Ah, Uncle, welcome home!
I hope I'm not intruding!
Jinta?
Yeah, sure.
Hurray! How cute!
Why would you make some for Uncle but not for Menma?
Can you please get rid of that habit of calling everything "cute"?
Uncle said Menma's cute too!
Eh? It's a great phrase, though. It can be used anywhere.
It wouldn't be used that way...
How would you like your egg?
One, poached.
Don't break it!
Okay.
Ah! Uncle too!
You're biased! You're biased toward middle-aged people!
I knew it...
Now for the TV...
Hi, everyone! Today...
Ah, that cat's cute.
Dad's being his usual self.
That means... I knew it.
Hey, Jintan!
Here.
Hurray!
Thanks for the food.
Pepper! Pepper! Pepper!
More pepper, that should do.
Menma wants some too!
Jinta?
Ah, nothing...
Where are the chopsticks?
The chopsticks!
Eh? What? What happened? Did you have a heat stroke?
Sure, it's cute, but it's not good!
Jintan?
The beast of summer...
Menma appeared in front of me with a reason.
Only that...
Maybe because there is a wish Menma wants to be granted!
A wish? What wish?
That's...
I don't know!
How are you going to have it granted if you don't even know what it is?
Hmm... Well, that's what I feel I'm here for...
What is it really, I wonder?
How the hell should I know?!
Ew! You spit on me! Jeez...
Barrier!
This is the beast of summer.
The source of my stress.
My trauma.
For now, try to recall that wish of yours.
Ah, right. It's a wish that can't be granted without everyone gathered together.
E-Everyone, you mean...
And then, Menma...
...dragged me into the light of summer.
This is bad, it's this time already!
Many things happened after that.
To me who's always dragged around by you.
No, to me who wants you to pull me.
Even so, I have gone outside after five years shut in my room.
Asking for help granted your wish that sounded impossible.
And ready to run from it.
But...
Amazing!
So Menma came back just to get you to grant her wish?
When you first showed up, Poppo was the only one I trusted.
And at that time,
something inside of me that had stopped working,
started to move again.
Boss, I'm done taking a break.
Yo!
Menma, how about I treat you to some food?
Oops, I'm wrong.
Maybe you've reincarnated already, have you?
Where are you?
If you are nearby, don't forget to give me call, okay?
Even if I'm busy,
I'll blast over to your place in no time!
Ah, but if you've reincarnated as a baby, you can't call me,
you still don't have a cellphone.
But even if that's the case
then please ask you mother to call me, okay?
Dear Poppo, I love how funny you are.
Love how funny I am, huh?
Menma, I apologize for everything that happened.
You know, I always put flowers here.
After that day.
In the place where you left.
I put them there
because I'm scared. I can't move there.
And can't help you.
How do I put it? Because of how weak I was back then,
I always think of my entire life as a punishment.
It's mean, right?
with arbitrarily I took your life, like a God I am.
I always wanted to apologize to you.
So, when Jintan said you'd appeared in his house,
honestly, I felt happy.
Not that I can fully believe all of what Jintan said.
But because, there's someone other than me who is still thinking about you.
I'm glad.
But,
because I can not see you.
I thought you still had a grudge against me.
So, because I can't see you,
I started to changed myself.
It's good!
Why do you stay in my house?
I brought vegetables from the mountain!
It's good with tempura!
Poppo's really enjoying his meal!
There's dirt on your nose.
Oh yeah, is Menma here?
Yes! I'm here!
Menma eat the tempura too!
Y-You really believe what I said about Menma.
I already told you that before!
But still...
After that day, I thought about it again.
Oh?
I don't really understand, but if Menma's here
maybe it's not a good sign.
Maybe she can't rest in peace.
So, she's here, right?
rest... in peace...
D-Don't ask me...
That's...
Jintan?
Menma...
Is Menma there?
Eh? A-Ah, she's...
Alright then!
Hah?! W-Wa...
Hey, Menma!
Will you give me a hint?
Eh?
I'll do that "PokkuPokkuChin" you know.
You have a wish, right?
You can count me in!
I'll help you until you can move on.
Hey, Hisakawa...
C'mon, Menma.
Please tell me.
Like, don't only show up in front of Jintan,
but in front of me too!
No good?
That's...
Menma wants to talk with everyone!
But, I don't know what I wish...
Then, Menma, let's think about it with everyone else.
The way to rest in peace.
I don't know.
It's alright, right? Please, let's think about it together.
I don't know...
That way, Menma...
Poppo!
Would you please stop that?
Eh?
I beg you, just stop.
Instead of apologizing to you,
what I did always made you more sad.
I'm really pathetic, aren't I?
Ouch!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Do you have a club activity today?
Not really.
Well then, would you...
Oh, the prince.
Prince?
You know? that first year that is popular among second years.
Oh, that.
Eh, it's a bad idea, isn't it?
It's fine.
But if he found out he'd get mad.
Menma,
He won't.
You told me to always work hard.
But to tell you the truth, it's really hard.
Lately, lots of thing don't work out as I planned.
But, it's not all that bad you know.
Just like that time.
Maybe, the way I run from reality is the same with doing that act.
After you're gone... from this world.
That's her!
Jintan!
Found her?
Ah, yeah.
Yu-Yukiatsu...
Careful, Jintan!
Yadomi?!
I'm okay.
Yukiatsu,
That dress...
Like the one that Menma wore.
W-Why are you dressed like that?
Um... Are you okay?
Do I look "okay" to you?
Hey! Look closer!
Hey, Yukiatsu!
Please, let them be.
Eh? B-But...
It's a good chance.
If this chance is gone, I'm sure he'll...
Tsuruko?
Hey, do I look like Menma?
You can see Menma, right?
Do I look like Menma?
Yukiats...
Do I look like her?
It's my fault!
That day Menma left, it's all my fault.
What are you talking about?!
It's not your fault! It's my fault...
I told you, it's my fault!
If I didn't talk like that, Menma wouldn't be gone.
I'm the one who killed her!
If Menma wants to show herself, she should be in front of me!
Haunt me, or curse me...
She should... show up in front of me!
But Menma didn't show up.
Not in front of me...
Yukiatsu...
That's because Menma isn't here anymore!
Not anywhere!
I'm here.
Menma said, "I'm right here"
You... Still act like that?
Menma said, "Thanks for the hair clip."
and "I'm Sorry."
U-Um you know, I don't really understand...
But...
Yukiatsu?
You still remember about that hair clip I gave you.
For my beloved Menma!
I'm sorry!
Ji-Jintan left.
So I have to chase him!
S-See you later!
Menma...
At first, I refused to accept it.
When I'd been told that you had gone from this world.
In the end, I...
...forever can't beat Jintan.
But, always talking about it makes me sick.
That's what Tsuruko says.
Even Anaru says you are not the type that can be popular.
She doesn't know.
What I said! I told you to stop it!
S-Sorry... I really am sorry...
Um...
Woah... Thank you very much!
Hurray!
We've got his photo!
Look? See how popular I am.
Yeah!
Yo!
It's summer vacation, and you're still here?
You're the same.
What do you need? Have you finished the letter?
Yeah, I've finished it at library.
Because if I wrote it at home alone, I would cry.
Yeah, Yeah.
You?
I've did it a while ago.
Hmm...
Don't get closer.
Don't get any closer than that.
Ah, I get it.
Hee... Do my legs look longer?
Even like this, I've reduced the color proportion.
How mean.
You go ahead.
I still want to finished this painting.
Oh, right, then I'll go first.
I think that painting is good.
See you.
Oh... Yes.
Hey, Menma.
You always praised how good my painting was.
Yes... I love painting.
But, it doesn't matter how hard I try,
I realized that there's one thing I can't make happen with my talent.
So, I changed my way of thinking.
If I still keep up with painting, doesn't mean there's nothing I can accomplished.
I always think too hard.
Sometimes, I shut off my own feelings.
Even to Yukiatsu.
All this time, I've loved him...
As I said, like this...
Like this?
But I can't win against you.
Not like that!
And after you've gone,
with only me beside him, it was more than enough for me.
I keep my feelings just like that.
Because, that way,
my feelings won't be hurt.
So, when I heard you were back,
There was some part of me that was afraid.
Satisfied yet?
And after that,
everyone started to believe that you really came back.
What do you mean by faking it?
My body feels afraid.
Don't laugh!
I'm really mad, you know!
So, I...
Yes, what's wrong? Have you finished it yet?
I'm still writing it...
Oh.
Hey, Tsuruko.
There's one thing I want to tell Menma.
Eh? Ah.
But, even if I can tell it to Menma.
I think...
I still can not tell it to that person.
"That person" is? Jintan?
If you keep hiding it, maybe you'll go berserk again, you know?
What do you mean berserk?!
Then, what about you?
What do you mean?
You'll go berserk toward Yukiatsu!
Not that bad, you know.
After all...
Yeah, but I still have
those feelings.
I see.
What should I do? Do you know?
He had a dark side like that.
And he really loved Menma.
Hmm...
But you know, this makes it easier for me.
Eh? Easier?
That means...
Eh? This time already!
It's about time to go, before it's too late.
Eh?
You should be ready too.
Oh ... Well, see you.
Dear Menma, thanks for the letter.
In your letter you said you love how steady am I, right?
But, I don't think I am that steady.
Because I'm always worried.
And the way some people always emit some aura that will never give up.
I'm really envious of that part of you.
Because I can't be like that.
The longer I think about what precious to me,
I can't think about something good.
After you came back into our lives,
I was able to be closer to Jintan again.
I thought if I granted your wish you could forgive me.
I don't know, since when...
Since when, I...
Ah, this is...
Somewhat...
The only difference is "interesting" and "fun."
She is really bad at writing.
Oh, this one is different.
"Today I fell when playing with everyone."
"It really hurt."
Oh, This one too.
"Today everyone and I went to visit Jintan's mom in the hospital."
Hospital, huh...
That's right, we went there a lot.
Mom!
Jintan's mom was always in the hospital.
That's right! Let's write a letter to God!
It will say "please heal Jintan's mom soon!"
How?
Jintan, look!
Oh yeah, that time!
Jintan?
"We've agreed to make fireworks."
"We think it will be hard."
"But, we'll still work hard."
Ah!
I remember!
We wanted to attach a letter on the rocket firework,
and send it to God!
Hey, isn't that her wish?!
That's right! It must be!
That time, we wanted to build one but we couldn't!
Right, Yadomi?
For mom's sake...
That time, I realized it...
About Jintan's feelings and my feelings.
Eh? You want another part time job?
Yeah, there's a construction job that looks fit for me.
You look pale, you know?
Ah... it's because I don't sleep.
Ah! You...
Maybe because all these things happening lately.
I forgot to eat or sleep.
Why?
Why you push yourself so hard like that?
Do you really care about Menma?
Eh? Ji-Jintan?!
Here, drink some.
Oh, thanks...
And this vitamin. For now drink this.
I feel better.
Hmm.
Jintan.
Huh?
Let's stop it.
You've already done too much.
Just stop this thing already, Okay?
What do you mean "this thing"?
Eh?
I still have job to do.
Don't go.
Eh?
Don't go!
At that time, I didn't want you to run!
"That time"?
I...
...will say something really mean about myself.
Eh?
That time, to be honest, I felt relieved.
When you said you didn't like Menma.
I know I'm terrible, but I felt happy.
But...
You just ran away like that...
That meant you do love Menma, right?
After that, I felt hurt.
I can't forgive myself that I feel happy because of it.
Because those words hurt Menma's feeling a lot.
Jintan...
I can't forgive myself for falling in love with you.
But still...
I... Until now...
You're still going? Can't you stay here?
You're weird, Jintan!
If Menma really in your home,
if her wish is granted, she would go and disappear, right?
Is it not a problem for you if Menma disappears?!
Even when you love her!
Welcome!
Jintan... You're such an idiot!
I'm such an idiot...
I'm really, really, really...
Really...
I don't know what to write, idiot!
Yeah, yeah, that's right! I'm an idiot!
I-I'm sorry...
Ah... what am I doing?
But it's true...
More over I've already written it anyways.
I better say it all, so I can feel relieve.
Eh?!
S-Sorry!
Ah, the French fries!
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry!
Um... my handkerchief...
It's okay.
Eh?
I don't know what happened, but try not to blame it all on yourself.
That's right, don't say you're an "idiot."
Look, it's not wet, right?
Right, you're not an idiot, just not careful.
That's right!
T-Thank you very much.
I still think there's something missing...
I really do always thinking too much.
No, that time it wasn't only me.
He...
What is he doing?
That's right, we're always thinking too much.
Because of that, at that time,
When there was a chance to make this feeling gone,
And say what had been shut inside myself...
Where are they?
Goodbye, Menma
It's okay, we'll meet tomorrow.
Let's get it started.
I'll go get them.
Eh? H-Hey, Poppo!
Good night.
Tsuruko!
I brought some snacks.
As expected of Tsuruko!
There are juices too.
I love you, Yukiatsu!
Hurray! It's a Party!
Party! Party!
My feelings always come true when I believe in you! I'm so happy!
Oh I really like these!
Everyone's gathered.
Ah, Nothing...
I have a feeling everything will be over.
Eh, together with Menma, we've been here at Super Peace Busters...
No need for small talk.
Okay.
Then, we welcome Menma!
Okay!
Everyone, thanks for coming.
Then this...
Tomorrow, Menma can rest in peace.
Please stay my friend until the end.
That's the greeting from Menma!
Super Peace Busters
Hey, Menma, want some?
That's too red. Eating something spicy will give you a stomachache, so I don't want to...
Um... something spicy...
It's not that spicy, you know!
It's okay, just try a little!
Is there some entertainment?
Eh?
If it's just like this, it's not much different than hanging out.
We are celebrating, right?
While everyones gathered here, let's do something.
Hurray!
Entertainment, but like what?
That's right.
Want to try to simulate "that day"?
Eh?
How about simulating the moment when we gathered here that day?
Moment when we gathered here?
Yukiatsu...
Don't play around! What's the point of that?!
Anaru!
Ji-Jintan...
STOP IT!
You do like Menma, right?
You guys!
Answer it. Menma is here, right?
Just answer it!
Yukiatsu...
Say it.
Say it. Say it.
Say it. Say it. Say it.
Wait a minute! It doesn't need to be like that!
Say it. Say it. Say it.
Say it. Say it. Say it.
I love her.
I always loved Menma...
If you run now, everything will be the same as before, Jintan!
Even when everyone has a bad feeling...
Jintan can still control himself.
Maybe it's because he is our leader.
That's why...
that's the reason why you only showed up in front of him, right?
Oh, you said you're going first?
Yeah, there's something I need to do.
Oh, something to do.
What?
You see.
You see, Jintan...
Hmm...
Nokemon and foreigners, they're the same, you know?
That's what Menma thought.
Oh...
Eh? What?!
Foreigners? You mean people from a different country?
Why they are the same as Viviton and the others?
Do you know what a foreigner is?
Don't make fun of me! Of course I know!
A person that came from a different country.
That's right. Then do you know what it is to be a Nokemon?
Hah?
Nokemon...
They live outside, but can not get inside the city.
Oh.
So, it's the same, right?
Huh?
And I think, Menma is the same as Nokemon and foreigners.
Because Menma is an outsider.
So Menma should not enter places
like school or home.
But maybe I can live in the kennel next door.
Because it's outside.
Huh?
And that puppy always told me to get inside the kennel.
Can we get along in there?
Won't it bite me?
Hey, this talk, what do you mean?
In class, we had a task to write a story, do you remember?
Oh, is that so?
A story about how Nokemon, foreigners, and Menma are all the same.
I still don't understand.
You have a Secret Base, right?
Eh?
Super Peace Busters Secret Base!
A place where everyone goes back to.
Yeah!
I'm going home!
Hey, do you want something to eat?
It's okay, What do you want?
Um... We had a soba last time...
Then how about beef over rice?
Woah, that's it!
Yeah, and a lot of it!
You'll get fat, you know!
I'm sorry, Jintan.
I shouldn't have done that.
Poppo...
I feel guilty. If everything goes back like before...
Goes back like before...
Hey!
Is what you said earlier true?
I-It's true...
I love you too!
W-When I said love, it's not only just as a friend... it' more...
I know! It's the I want to marry you type of I love you, right?
If Menma had another life, when Menma grew up
maybe Menma would have married you, Jintan.
I want it to be like that too...
Eh?
How about you don't go.
Just stay here, it's okay right?
Jintan...
I said it...
I'm still going.
Eh?
Then I'll be reincarnated!
If I'm not there, then I can't be reincarnated,
and I can't talk with the others like before.
Ah, but what if I reincarnated as a worm?
That time, you made your decision.
I'm so pathetic.
Yo!
Oh, sorry I made you wait, even when I invited you.
It's okay, I just got here.
Oh, really...
Eh? Are you get taller?
You think so?
Maybe because you've stopped growing, Jintan-senpai.
Please stop calling me "Jintan-senpai."
Then, what do you need?
Oh, this.
Give it to Men...
Can you give it to your sister?
It's cupcakes?
Yeah.
My father taught me to how to make them.
Not like that Jinta-kun.
Why not? Doesn't the cake need baking powder so it can get fluffy?
We're making the ones that taste the same as what Touko made.
With this! Pancake Mix!
Eh? Pancake?
This can be used to make cupcakes too.
Look on it's back. There are steps to mix the ingredients.
Well, it's true.
It's much easier with Mom's recipe.
The truth is Touko wasn't an expert at cooking.
But that is what made her cute.
Well, it's surprisingly easy with him around.
Hee... it looks delicious.
Ah, but why don't you come to our house?
My parents want to meet you.
Oh, that's true.
Next time we will come.
Ah, everyone from Super Peace Busters!
Eh? Ah, yeah.
Yeah.
Should I go?
Even if it's useless, should I go?
But, because of Menma, we're gathered with everyone again.
How if, the situation turned around?
Anaru?
Eh?!
What are you doing?
You aren't going? To the Secret Base.
Eh? Oh, that...
Huh?
I'm going of course!
Why are you so worked up?
No reason.
Let's go.
Jintan, did you get taller again?
I've been told that I have stopped growing.
Huh?
Nothing.
Maybe because your high heels aren't as high as usual.
Eh? It's the same as usual, you know!
Liar. You must be getting taller again.
You see, Jintan.
What?
I...
Have you done your letter? It must be three paragraphs!
Three paragraphs? It has to be like that?
Of course! So it looks tidy and the meaning can reach the person who reads it!
What am I talking about?
So, it must be three paragraph!
I've only written one paragraph myself.
It's not homework after all.
What's important is our feelings that are in the letter.
Summer...
That summer...
And that summer...
Jeez, you'll never understand. That's why you never get a good mark.
No matter how many summers come,
I still can't tell him what I really feel.
That has nothing to do with my marks.
It does!
It doesn't!
It does!
There's only one thing...
Auntie, please wait a little longer.
Everyone's firework is going to be finished soon.
Please wait... a little longer...
Oh, Jintan! Anaru! Took you long enough!
What, we're the last?
We've just arrived here too.
Yo!
Okay!
Super Peace Busters have gathered around!
Tsuruko, you want some lotion?
I've used it a lot.
Sending a letter by burning it, huh?
It's a bit too late to ask, but it's just like giving presents to God.
It doesn't matter, right? Just think about it as Menma's Lantern Festival.
Lantern?
But it's still bright out here.
If you want it to be like that, should it be when the sky is dark?
Really?
Whoa, I made a mistake!
If I knew it would be like this, I would've prepared the barbecue party first!
Whatever the event there should be a barbecue, huh?
Oh, right! Wait here!
Ta-da!
Eh? What's with the fireworks?
Hey, hey.
This is what you brought, Anaru-sanyuu.
Eh?
You know, at the last barbecue party.
Oh!
I remember!
When Yukiatsu dressed like a pervert that time!
Hey!
A-Ah, sorry! Sorry!
Don't talk about that again!
Now, now.
We've all gathered here,
let's make this party a blast!
Oh, yeah,
We used to gather here,
but when you said it, it's a long time ago.
You're right.
If it's weird to do the festival at noon,
lighting fireworks at this time is even weirder, right?
It isn't.
Rocket fireworks are more interesting when it's noon.
Last year too, we launched a big rocket to outer space.
Yeah, it was really amazing.
Of course, it cost big money.
It's true, really pretty.
Yeah.
Menma must be happy.
Then the rocket firework launched.
We believed that firework was your last wish.
But...
Woah! There's flowers blooming in the sky!
Eh?
Menma...?
You didn't disappear.
Why won't it light?
That time, we were all surprised.
Maybe it's soggy.
It's has been here a year after all.
But there was a part of me that felt relieved.
No way! The case is still sealed.
C'mon! Light up!
It's won't light after all.
Anaru, give me hand!
Oh, yeah.
We didn't understand what Menma's wish was anymore.
The feeling that's locked inside ourself can't reach you.
So, we keep trying to face our feelings.
And shout it all out.
Shout it...
Then...
I...
... am sorry!
Eh?
I don't care about Jintan anymore!
I just want to honestly apologize to Menma, then...
A-Anaru...!
What?!
Your eyelash... It's split in two.
Eh? Oh no! Are they loose?!
Jeez! Yukiatsu!
I knew it, there was something weird about your eyes, Anaru.
Tsuruko! You..!
You didn't need to enhance your eyelashes. You've got two already, right? Anaru?
You're okay without them.
Jeez! Thank you!
But stop calling me Anaru!
Eh, if I think about it...
We used our old nicknames again.
You're right.
Just like you say, Yukiatsu.
Eh?
Far inside of me, I'm glad only I can see Menma.
Jintan?
But Menma doesn't think like that.
Eh?
The truth is
I'm glad that she didn't move on.
But she still wants to go.
She wants to talk with everyone, not only with me.
That's why she wants to move on and be reincarnated.
Let's grant what Menma's true wish.
We'll call Menma here and use her diary to talk with her.
Once again... with Menma!
Agreed!
It's useless if Menma isn't here! Because...
without all six together,
we're not the Super Peace Busters.
Yeah!
Wa... That's my line!
What?
I leave it to you, leader!
Yeah.
I'll go get Menma. We'll meet at the secret base!
Just give it up!
NO! Just a little more!
That's what you said all this time!
Oh yeah, leader.
E-Eh? Leader?
You still want to work there?
Stop calling me "leader."
Yeah, because I can play games there.
And school? You sure you can graduated?
Y-Yeah, even if it's just so-so.
Anyway, if you want to ask about me, don't do it at the same time!
You guys are really harmonious!
H-Harmonious?
Eh?
What with your reaction?
Shut up.
Huh? What's with you?
Hey, guys! Please help me stop Poppo!
It's okay, just give it to me! If I give it more heat, it will light!
Hey, careful.
It's okay, just stop it already.
If we stop here, it wont be a festival!
Since when has this had a great effect on it?!
Let it go!
Jintan, took you so long...
Are you playing with everyone?
That's nice...
But in this condition
Menma only will be a troublesome to you, right?
Auntie, thank you.
Menma's really happy, because Menma can be with everyone again.
At last I want to say goodbye to them...
Oh?
I knew it, Jintan really is...
Menma!
Menma...
Welcome home.
Me-Menma!
What's wrong? Why are you like this?!
It's likely Menma's wish has been granted...
What?
Menma remembered the promise that Menma and Auntie made.
W-With my mom?
There's only one thing...
Jinta never cried.
Maybe he deliberately hid his emotions
after I became like this.
Auntie?
I want to be reincarnated, but that is the only thing making me worried.
He already holds it in too much.
I want him to express his emotions
like laughter, anger, or even crying.
I got it!
Menma promises! Menma will make Jintan cry!
Yeah.
Thank you, Menma-chan.
Then I leave him to you.
Yeah!
But you know, even if I tried to think about it,
Menma still didn't know what to do.
So, I asked for help from everyone.
Calling them together.
Ah, it doesn't mean everyone would have bullied you until you cried...
Menma...
Because Menma is not that smart, that's why Menma asked everyone.
...come back here...
Then explained it to everyone, so it wouldn't hurt you.
...so her wishes can be granted...
But in the end.
It didn't go well.
I think this is a punishment, because I kept it a secret from you.
It's not a punishment!
It doesn't have to do with what you were hiding from me!
I always go there, to that place...
Whenever it is!
Jintan, you cried again...
But you know, Menma prefers your smiling face.
I think it's time to say goodbye.
Wait! You can't go now! Wait a little longer!
Don't say goodbye just to me!
I wanted to see you.
I always wanted to see you!
Calling your name!
Apologizing to you!
Telling you how I love you!
Jintan...
But..!
Everyone has the same feeling!
Everyone loves you!
Everyone wanted to see you!
Everyone is waiting for you...
Waiting for us!
There... In our place!
Jintan...
I want to grant your wish.
I love you, Jintan.
But, why is this happening so suddenly?
Menma's really having fun.
I want to be with you forever!
Very happy. It makes me want to be with you forever...
Ji-Jintan?!
Guys!
Menma? Me-Menma?!
Menma!
Hey, Jintan!
Here, Jintan.
Oh, thanks.
By the way, the sun really won't set.
You're right.
In the end, we can't use those fireworks.
Yeah, it means we can only wait.
Thank you, Tsuruko.
Eh?
That.
Menma's cup.
That's right, she really loves something like this,
but I never realized it.
Don't exaggerate.
That day when Menma was still here,
I don't even think about this kind of thing.
Ah!
What are you doing?
While we're all here waiting,
how about playing hide and seek?
We can't answer.
Why did Poppo give this kind of idea?
I know, even for just a second, I can understand.
It's alright.
Oh!
That's right.
Rock, paper, scissors!
Damn!
Poppo still uses rock.
He never changes from old times.
He really is easy to predict.
Shut up, damn!
I-It's hide and seek...
W-What do you mean hide and seek?
Jintan, is she playing hide and seek?
Hey, Menma!
Hide and seek?
Hey, Jintan!
Wait!
Menma!
Hey, let's go too!
Y-Yeah.
Let's go!
Okay.
That's right, playing hide and seek...
80... 81... 82...
We wish we could see her...
She was there last time,
but we couldn't see her.
But playing hide and seek...
We can see her.
Not only me.
But everyone from Super Peace Busters, one by one.
And then...
Once again in this place...
In the place Menma can always go home...
Super Peace Busters always together.
Are you ready?
Super Peace Busters
Not... Not yet...
Menma still hasn't... said goodbye properly.
Menma!
Menma!
Not yet!
Yeah.
Not yet... Everyone waiting for me.
Menma had to....
Yukiatsu.
Menma!
When you dressed like a girl,
Menma thought you were pretty.
And you have a prettier heart than anyone.
Anaru.
Menma!
Anaru,
You always do the best you can and your heart is so warm.
When Menma's around you, Menma feels spoiled by you.
Tsuruko.
Menma!
You were always nice to me, whenever it was.
If Menma reincarnated,
I want to be born a girl just like you.
Menma!
Poppo.
You always entertain us with your jokes.
Menma's laughing so hard because of you, it makes Menma's stomach hurt.
When everyone's together, Menma feels really happy.
Menma!
But I realized one thing.
When you guys are together,
everyone feels sad too.
From the start, you always imitated Honma Meiko.
D-Don't so easily say the name of the dead.
If Menma wants to show herself, she should be in front of me!
Haunt me, or curse me...
She should... show up in front of me!
Like, don't only show up in front of Jintan,
but in front of me too!
Your sister is slow minded.
Maybe she still doesn't know that she is already dead.
Please stop haunting me.
When I'm together with you, I remember...
Always remember those sad memories.
I don't like that feeling.
Menma doesn't want to look at everyone sad anymore...
...sad because of me.
But, Jintan... Menma...
You must be mad at me.
ENOUGH!
At first, you always thought about others!
Eh?
Please think about yourself!
Y-Your attitude makes me sick, you know!
Even when you're hurt, you're still laughing.
Even when crying, you're still thinking about others!
Why am I this mad?
Jintan...
I...!
Sorry, if Menma didn't realized it until now.
To grant Menma's wish,
you're working hard all the time.
New boy, over here!
O-Okay!
Over here, next!
Okay!
He's really working hard.
Of course.
Because he's amazing.
Menma never thought about herself,
but all this time, he has always thought about me.
Hey, careful when you walk.
O-Okay!
Hey, what's wrong?
Don't move the light as you like!
How come?
Maybe because of the wind.
There's no way wind can move that lamp.
So cool.
You have been highlighted...
Looks really cool.
You're always working hard for Menma's sake.
So...
So, Menma...
When Menma remembered the wish, I couldn't tell it to you.
I'm home.
Menma... You waiting for me?
Your nails are all black!
Let me clean them!
Eh? No need!
Yes need!
I know.
If her wish is granted, Menma...
Ouch!
Sorry, sorry!
Just hold still a little longer.
But, that's...
...what Menma really wished.
Then, I have to...
Jintan?
Eh? Oh...
Why? Is it really that painful?
N-No...
A Flanders! Somehow I remembered about that...
Eh?
About Patrasche.
Patrasche?
A Flanders... that old TV show...
What do I say? There's no way she believes that kind of story!
But...
Jintan?
Jintan!
I believe that Patrasche is really happy now!
Yeah...
Because, Nelo's really, really nice to her, right?
They're best friends, right? So don't cry, okay?
Yeah...
Menma-chan
Menma's wish is...
your mom's wish too.
That wish is granted, and Menma can make you...
...cry.
Because...
On that day, you pulled my hand.
On that day, you made a promise with me.
You have a secret base, right?
Eh?
Super Peace Busters Secret Base.
A place where everyone goes back to.
So...
Menma's going to the place where you are.
Menma!
Not yet.
Not yet... a little longer.
Super Peace Busters
Wait a little longer.
Jintan! Have you found her?
Your feet...
Jintan...
So it's true Menma is already...
What is that?
Anaru, Yukiatsu, Jintan, Poppo, Tsuruko.
T-This is from her diary.
This writing, it's Menma...
Really?
Dear Tsuruko, I love how kind you are.
Menma...
Dear Yukiatsu, I love how hardworking you are.
Dear Poppo, I love how funny you are.
Dear Anaru, I love how steady you are.
I love you, Jintan. It's the "I want to marry you" type of "I love you."
Made it in time...
This time I can say it properly.
Now...
What is this?
What are you doing, Menma?
We are playing hide and seek, right?
So...
It's not over until we've found you, right?!
Jintan...
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
I'm ready!
That's Menma's voice...
She's...
Menma...
Menma!
It's really you, Menma?
Menma! It's Menma!
I can see her!
Menma!
Menma!
Menma...
If you've found me, that's not what you should shout, right?
What?
Menma sucks at playing hide and seek, you know?
Right, Jintan? Say it properly...
What?
Like that,
a farewell can be done, right?
I've read your letter!
I love you too, Menma!
Me too, I love you!
I love you too!
Of course, I love you too!
A farewell isn't one sided, right?
Right? Jintan?
Thanks for granting my mom's wish.
I love you, Menma.
It's bad!
Ah?
It's them!
Damn!
You... told me
everyone's waiting for me with a smile.
Jintan, Menma, found you!
Damn, it's because you're slow.
Ah? So-Sorry...
A kennel isn't enough.
Eh?
Umm... It's about your story about Nokemon and foreigners.
Even if you sleep inside a kennel,
or go anywhere, there must be someone who will find you.
Remember that.
Jintan...
Ah!
Jintan made Menma cry again!
Jintan.
Jeez, Jintan!
Eh?!
Made her cry! Made her cry!
I'm gonna tell the teacher!
Poppo, are you turning against me too?
Made her cry! Made her cry!
Jintan, you shouldn't do that! Jeez!
Shut up, Poppo!
You shut up! It's your fault!
Why is it my fault?
Jintan...
Menma believes,
whenever it is, everyone from Super Peace Busters
can find me, anywhere I am.
So...
Menma...!
Wants to be together with everyone longer!
Playing together...
So, I'll be reincarnated,
And play with everyone again!
So because Jintan has cried...
And we have said a goodbye...
So...!
One, Two... !
Menma, found you!
I've been found...
Menma, as I thought,
until the end, I will...
...love you!
Are you ready?
Not yet!
Hey, make it faster!
Are you ready?
Ji...
I'm ready!
Eh?!
Eh, hurry move over there!
Huh? What? What are you doing?
Move!
There's no time! Hurry!
Alright!
I'll find all of you, without a single one left!
Over there!
He's gone.
Yeah.
Umm... You see, Jintan...
Jintan?
Super Peace Busters Always Together.
Must be it.
Eh?
Not my mother's wish,
but Menma's wish.
I see.
You're right.
Hm?
Anaru? Eh, hey!
Hmm... Where are you guys?
Hey... Hey!
Hey you! We're playing hide and seek, why you writing a letter at a time like this?!
Oh! Anaru, found you!
Damn!
That voice..!
Jintan, found you!
Ah...
Damn, it's your fault, Anaru!
So, Anaru, this time it's your turn to....
Please shut up!
Huh?
Don't "huh" me!
You two get out now!
Hurry!
It's something perverted, you know!
W-What?
P-Perverted?
Just get out!
What was that?
The rumor that woman will shout if they're horny is true.
Then, let's do it.
Hey!
Menma, did you get it?
Please answer!
Give it more strength would you, leader.
If you've gotten them, reply fast! Even if it just a joke it's okay!
I told you, stop calling me like that!
I...
...finally can write something that I couldn't say before.
Eh?
About how I love Jintan.
I have apologized to Menma for keeping it a secret from her.
Oh. So will you tell it to him too?
If I do say it to Jintan, I think I can't say it yet.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Because my feelings for Menma are the same as my feelings for Jintan.
Oh.
Also...
Hmm?
We will always be friends together forever.
In that summer, and this summer.
As long... As long as we keep this relationship,
one day, I'm sure, this feeling in this summer...
...will reach him.
If it were me, I would say it to him.
Eh?
Eh? What?!
W-What was that? So you guys...
Hey, hey!
What are you guys talking about?
Let me in too. The "Girl's talk"!
Shut up!
My my, they're at it again.
Huh? It's okay! Let me in too!
No way!
There's no way someone as big as you can join in a "Girl's talk."
Even if you are not here anymore,
"Girl's talk"? I want to join too.
Because, I'm the only one who fits in here.
with only memories of you left,
Jeez! Just because you've used make-up before doesn't mean you can join us!
for some reason, the view here seems different.
Even if there are only few precious memories of you left,
We'll make sure we won't forget them.
No.
Oh, The stars, it's a lot.
Pretty!
It's rare to see this many stars from here.
Woah!
But for us, there's no memories missing from you.
Hey, Poppo,
maybe this is Menma's answer.
Oh! Seriously!
Eh...
Super Peace Busters Always Together
You're the only one who can say that without getting embarrassed..
He's our leader after all.
Eh? What was that?
Again, calling me leader!
Our leader is amazing!
Menma!
We got your answer!
Thank you!
Next year and a year after that, let's do this again, okay?
Oh, Yukiatsu! Nice idea!
Next year we have the exam, you know? We won't make it.
Don't worry!
If it's Jintan, he can do it!
What?! Jintan, you must take the exam to graduate!
Why only me?! If it's only graduated, I can make it!
Oh, where do you get that?
T-This...
Cupcakes?
Today, I was told to put them here.
Umm... for sister...
Next time,
invite them all to pray together, okay?
Yeah.
Oh?
What is it?
No, it's like, that photo of sister looks like it's smiling, doesn't it?
It's always been smiling.
That's true, but
her smile looks more cheerful than usual.
C'mon, hurry take a bath.
Okay.
If I reincarnated, what would I become?
A flower? A Butterfly?
An Ant? Or a Potato?
Whatever I become doesn't matter, because...
...Super Peace Busters...
...are always together, forever!
Super Peace Busters Always Together
