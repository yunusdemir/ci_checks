YESTERDAY, TODAY AND TOMORROW
They're coming.
How punctual !
Is this number 7, Carbone Alley?
Yup.
At said location
on 16 September 1954
furniture will be impounded
from Adelina Sbaratti...
My wife.
the consignee, due to lack of payment
of a 28,000 lire fine.
£ 28,000 is the fine.
With processing fees,
interest and costs, etc.
It brings us to 50,780.
Wasn't it better to pay 28,000?
Well?
Well, are you going to pay this 50,780?
You kidding? We didn't pay 28,
you expect us to pay 50 ?!
- Where's the consignee?
- My wife?
Yes, the consignee.
She's not here.
Doesn't matter. If you don't pay,
I'll take the furniture.
Come in, officer.
Let's see now.
One walnut table, 2 metres by 1½...
So, you cleared everything out.
It's out of my hands now.
This is a matter for the courts.
Make way!
We suckered him good!
Here's your Adelina Sbaratti!
Shove it!
Is that all you know?
Obscene gestures, threats?
Who do you think you fooled just now?
You ruined yourself
with your own hands!
- What's this guy want?
- Professional intruder.
- Who is he?
- Never seen 'im.
I'm Verace, Attorney-at-law!
And you're an illiterate boaster!
Some trick ! You bought yourself
a peck of trouble.
You'll see when the police come.
The crime you committed,
carries jail time.
What crime?
My friend, you violated article 384
of the penal code.
<b>That's</b> what you did!
Hey, Counselor!
Explain it to us, we're ignorant.
Counselor?!...
First you make a mess,
then you come to us!
It was only a fine!
Which you didn't pay,
so they impounded your furniture.
Then you got the brilliant
idea of hiding it.
It was almost £ 30,000 !
My friend is not well off.
What was the fine for?
Contraband cigarettes.
I'm truly sorry, my friend,
Sorry to have to tell you
you're in big trouble.
Not me, it's my wife,
my children's mother!
The fine was hers.
The furniture's hers.
The rental lease is hers.
Jail time will be hers, too.
Don't let him get away.
Pasquale, run, call Adelina!
Counselor!
Counselor.
- Look you must leave. <b>GET LOST</b> !!
- She's my children's mother !
Pall-a Mall-a, Chesterfiell-o
O viecchie coa barba(Bearded man)
Cigarettes!
English, American, Swiss!
Maybe I can snag a buyer.
English, American, Swiss!
Who'll smoke 'em?
Sir, I buy dollars.
Get outta here!
Adelina, you gotta persuade
the lawyer. Come quick!
- What lawyer?
- What about her smoke-stand?
The bailiff came, and a lawyer
says we're in trouble.
What the ... ?
Fucking Assholes ! (Cuckolds)
Oh, Madonna mia!
Rotten brat, c'mere!
- Leave him, come see the lawyer!
- He tried to burn me!
Go, we'll fix that kid.
- What about my box?
- You'll find it as you left it.
Assholes! (Cuckolds)
Swiss cigarettes?
American, French, English.
Hey, outta my way!
This gentleman's mine, outta my way!
English, American, Swiss...
- But ma'am—
<i><b>- GET OUT !!
They're leaving!
If he says it, it must be true.
He said he can't help you,
and he really can't.
Would he lose business for fun?
Maybe he's angry.
Maybe we pissed him off.
<i>- <b>GET OUT !!</b></i>
- They're going!
I told you, go.
Let us see him, and there's
something in it for you too.
Upon my word, I never saw
two more conniving people!
You, get the door.
I'm not budging !
- Hey, Carmine.
- Finally, come, come.
Who are you?
What do you want?
Where are you going?
- That way.
- Let's go.
What ?!..."Let's go" ?!
You <b>can't</b> go in! Got it?
Pasquale, Amedeo.
Where is he?
Counselor, help us!
We can't let her go to jail!
What jail? I was fined for
contraband cigarettes.
Know how long it takes
to make £ 28,000 ?
Days, weeks... Forget about it!
Stuck on the same spot,
 rain or shine.
Wanna know how long
my husband's unemployed?
Ever since his military service!
How can we get by?
<b>How will my child eat?
Then some asshole(cuckold)
comes along and arrests you.
No, wait! They can't arrest her.
What do you mean, Counselor?
Not with such a belly!
They can't arrest her, 'cause of her belly.
They can't arrest her, get it?
...Belly out to here!
A jail-able offence,
but can't be arrested.
- Why not?
Pleading her belly.
Get this, if you please!
Herself, may not be arrested.
Why not?
- Pleading her belly
- She's ready to pop.
It's the belly !
Is it her belly?
Yes, big round belly!
Big round belly, big round belly.
Big round belly, cha-cha-cha.
Big round belly, big round belly.
Big round belly, cha-cha-cha.
Big round belly!
Good morning.
Congratulations!
Thank you.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Congratulations, Adelina.
I got an American specialty,
"Painless Labor".
- Good luck!
- Same to ya.
-I'm happy for you.
-Atta girl !
Here you are, still warm.
- Put it on my tab.
- Oh, alright.
Get'em, piping hot!
- How could a lawyer be wrong?
- Dig in.
When a woman is pregnant,
she can't be arrested...
until six months after
the birth of the baby.
She's entitled to six months
for nursing.
Watch it!
Kids are a great thing.
Where there's children
there's providence...
although I've never had the pleasure.
You saying it's my fault?
I've got what it takes.
But let's not broach this
topic, for the love of God.
That's not what I meant.
I'm just saying that
the best thing in the world
is when a man comes home
and his wife says: "Listen,
me and you are gonna have a baby".
♪ <i>Core ingrato
(Ungrateful heart)
What about this "Ungrateful heart"?
- I was doing military service
- No, let me tell it.
I was 17...
We were going together.
Then the 'thing' happened.
"Carmine, who's gonna tell Mama?"
This idiot was all happy.
"Are you really sure?"
"Yes. I know a midwife.
I'll go see her tonight."
"But I can't get leave."
I say, "If it's positive,
I'll come outside the barracks
and sing 'Core ingrato'"
So that's it.
All night long: ♪ <i>Core ingrato
Who could sleep?
As soon as I finished my service
we got married.
Mama was against it.
"Adelina, my girl, I can't give you a cent.
Carmine's flat broke. I had 15 kids.
If you take after me, how will you live?"
"Mama, we'll be careful."
You didn't keep your word
now you're pregnant again.
Yeah, just look at me!
I could have gone to jail !
Baby's due any day... A short rest...
July, August, September,
October, November, December...
Carmine, you'll have to
get it in gear by Christmas.
-Of course...
-Otherwise...
Present (and ready for duty)
- Merry Christmas!
- Thank you.
- Good night. Merry Christmas!
- Thank you.
Well, Mama, good night.
Merry Christmas.
Christmas on my own.
You have things to do.
- Mama, I explained.
- I understand.
But we'll have dinner tomorrow.
Enrico.
Oh, I nearly forgot.
Granny made some ointment
for your chilblains.
I put it on him at night?
Yes, rub it on him at bedtime.
Thanks, Mama. Tomorrow, for sure.
Take care.
Merry Christmas again.
Adelina.
Carmine.
Come celebrate with us.
Amedeo brought a huge
'panettone' from Milan.
Come on, they're all waiting.
- Pasquale, I'm sorry.
- It's Christmas, and I don't wanna go to jail...
Oh, I get it. Your Christmas
is better than ours.
Better... worse ?! Get moving!
Who's in there?
Adelina Sbaratti.
I'm here, come in.
Adelina, the term's up.
It's time for your vacation.
In the name of the law
I declare you under arrest.
What's that supposed to mean?
Means the Medical Certificate
is on the table.
If you want it, help yourself.
Or come back in a few months,
and you'll get two.

And take the umbrella.

Come back, you rascals!
Get back here this minute!
Where are you off to?
What if it rains?
Don't worry, if it rains
I'll stand in a doorway.
Kids !...
Open wide, here comes the fuel.
Me, me, me, me!
They finished, Pasquale?
All gone. Look!
Can you make a pacifier for Caterina.
Right away.
OK, OK, I hear you.
Let's make the pacifier later.
Now we'll calm down the kids.
Come. Uncle Pasquale brought
you something nice.
Easy now, one at a time.
Hey, one at a time.
One for you, one for you...
And these are for later.
Quiet, now while Uncle makes
a pacifier for Caterina.
Nunziatina, let mommy
tie a bow in your hair.
- No!
Oh, you gotta have a bow!
Hey, no bow, no candy !
Where's Carmine?
Pasquale, he's in a bad way.
7 kids are as loud as a brass band.
They won't let him sleep.
This morning he was so fagged out,
I sent him to get an hour's sleep at his mom's.
He's still there.
How pretty you look!
Now Uncle Pasquale will
give you another candy.
Right away!
The 'brass band' seems
to agree with you, though.
You always looked good, bless you.
But, you look better than ever now.
Kids agree with me. Some women
fall apart after the first.
Not me, look.
- Seven kids !
- Bless you.
The cough syrup, I forgot.
- I won't take it.
- Oh, you'll take it!
We're not made of money.
We bought the medicine
and we gotta use it.
I won't take it.
You'll take it, and how!
C'mere.
Hnngh! I'll kill you!
Not like that. Be nice, you'll
get results. Let me show you.
Come out!
Come to Uncle Pasquale.
Up your ass !
Is that any way to talk
to Uncle Pasquale? Come on.
What'd he do?
He bit my hand. It's nothing.
(Damn your living ancestors)
(Damn the souls of your dead ancestors)
He'll come out.
Get out from under there.
I got him!
Hold him tight.
Don't let him go.
You'll drink it, or my name
isn't Adelina Sbaratti.
- I won't !
- You will !
It's sweet and healthy and we can't
throw money out the window
for your whims ! £ 400 !
What are you doing?
Did you hurt yourselves?
Shoo, shoo!

Come on, out you go!
Get outta here!
Wait...
Buy yourselves a lollipop.
Go, go! Shoo, shoo!
Get, <b>outta</b> here!
I'm gonna send them to school.
I won't listen to reason.
Come here, cutie-pie.
Now go to bed like a good girl.
Adelina, does she need a snack?
Snack ?! She had two plates
of tube pasta. Put her to bed.
She's nodding off already.
Beddy-byes, then.
Here you go.
Damn kids are all fired up!
I'd keep you company,
but I have things to do.
Off you go, and thank you.
What a good father you'd make!
Pasquale!
Are you crazy?
Pardon me. I lost my sense.
I'm sorry. Damn!
I'm going crazy, crazy!
Mama can you hear them?
I came to sleep. Talk to Don
Antonio. Just ½ an hour's rest!
Son, they have to work.
That's why my rent's next to nothing.
(1 bed-bug per month)
Don Antonio, will you be long?
10 more minutes,
then we break for lunch.
Then, you'll go on hammering?
Don't worry. We'll let Carmine
 get an hour's sleep.
Thank you.
Please...
How long do I have to wait for this jerk?
"I'll come at 9:00."
10:30 and he's nowhere to be seen.
Ah, finally!

Took you long enough.
Will you move it!

No, bless the bed.
You want a boy or a girl?
Boy, girl, twins, whatever.
As long as it's a sure thing.
Sure as can be,
but that costs £ 50 extra.
Alright.
- Ring this bell.
- Now?
When do you think, tomorrow ?!
- Where's your husband sleep?
- Here.
Ring .
Hear me, Saint Nicholas.
Carmine is still asleep.
Who wishes ill upon this house
Must bleed his heart outside.
Good or evil eye, twist and turn
the fruitful apple of her eye
Garlic and labor pains
May the spell not curdle.
Incense myrrh and gold,
Cast out the curse.
I can't take it anymore!
Right, dear.
You must look after your health.
And the first thing is sleep.
I'll make some chamomile.
Mama, chamomile?!
Three years of living hell,
and you give me chamomile?
It's a curse.
Three years of the same old song.
"Carmine, get busy!
Carmine, the nursing term's over!
"Carmine, come home early!
"Carmine, turn out the light!"
All on one bowl of bean soup a day.
I'm not made of iron.
Now and then a special request
is fine, but this is nonstop.
You look wrecked.
'Course I am!
Dizzy spells come and go,
wobbly legs.
And if you must know,
twice I fainted in the street.
The more crapped out I get,
the stronger she gets.
How pretty she's become, Mama.
She bloomed like a rose.
May she drop dead!
She's destroying my son.
How ugly you've gotten!
You look like an ape.
Your rose, beautiful as she is...
can get somebody else
to puff up her belly.
I'd kill her...
if anything like that happened.

Damn, this time I was sure!
15 days!
I even booked a doctor's visit
for the certificate.
Instead I got nails in my head
and I feel wrecked !
I can't deal with this
every month, anymore.
Here he is.
Well?
Hit the road !
What's that supposed to mean?
Means I was late,
so "fuck you"!
What can I do about that?
Are you trying to send
this poor girl to jail?
- Me?
- Yeah, you!
- How could you think that?
- Damn right, we think that!
Courtesy of my husband.
Look and learn!
You may go in.
Thank you.
Come, come.
Have a seat.
Doc, sorry to jump in but...
you always get the freshest
cigarettes, from me.
I thought you'd appreciate
my special treatment
and you'd do the same for me.
Sure.
- How's business?
- Thank god (it's not worse).
What is this about?
Carmine, you're the man.
You should tell him.
He's awestruck.
A doctor is like a confessor.
Professor, I—
Anyway since we got married,
it's been nonstop.
Not even a slackening
of the 'current'.
Seven kids and I'm still nursing.
It's not my fault, Doctor.
The will is there.
You bet.
We married for love.
Obviously the will was there.
If this goes on, who'll
provide for 7 kids?
He's unemployed. I have to
provide everything, professor.
I understand. Your wife's right.
Sure, but I'm right too.
We're not beasts. Sure, your wife
is pretty, you're in love.
But, my boy, you should
control yourself.
It's not desire I lack.
I have that.
Wait till it passes.
So you don't want any more children?
No, it's just the opposite, Doctor.
This guy's 'Out of Service'.
One minute.
The desire is there.
Excuse me. I don't understand.
What is it you want?
Another child!
Holy smokes! You came to have
your husband examined?
Yes, sir.
Alright. Come on, then.
Sit here.
Take off your jacket.
- The desire is there.
- I feel the desire too, doc.
Cross your legs.
His leg reacts, it moves.
Who gives a fuck
if his leg moves, doc?
You're slightly anemic.
Let's check your blood pressure.
Your husband has nothing wrong.
He's just very tired.
And undernourished.
Is it serious, Doc?
Not at all.
No need to worry. It's a non-issue.
- Pressure's 80.
- Eighty?
- Is that good?
- No, it's bad. He's exhausted.
What should he do, doc?
Let him be.
You don't whip a tired horse.
You put him in the stable.
Let him be for 2 or 3 months.
Meanwhile, he'll re-constitute himself,
he'll eat nourishing food,
and you'll have the baby next year.
Adelina, good evening.
Look at this.
I brought a re-constituting
medicine for Carmine.
Atta-boy. What is it?
Injections, some German stuff.
Never mind the doctor.
The pharmacist says this is special.
After a month of this cure-
Look how big they are.
Carmine will be a lion!
In a month I'll be carted off to jail.
Don't talk like that, Adelina.
"Diseases of the—
para— lina—
hepati-"
What does that mean?
"Be sure to distinguish...
between the dextro-"
Pasquale, come here.
Better you than someone else.
Adelina...
I won't go to jail, see?
I won't go.
You go around saying
you've got what it takes.
Show me.
Now?
Now.
Here?
Here.
Adelina.
My darling.
Yes.
- Where's Carmine?
- Took the kids to his mom's.
He left Nunziatina
and Caterina here.
OK, let 'er rip.
- Oh, Adelina.
- Oh, Madonna!
- Pasquale, let go of that!
- Do anything you like.
I can't do it.
I can't.
I want my Carmine.
What the hell?
I don't understand you.
Do you take me for a buffoon?
You asked me, so let's do the deed.
Shame on you!
What a fine friend my husband has!
But it was you!
Yes, it was me!
Are you crazy?
My God.
Hey, girls. Girls!
Wake up, girls.
German stuff...
Wake up, Mama's taking you to jail.
- To jail?
- Yes, jail!
I'm a fool to love you.
I'll go to jail and that's that.
We'll put an end to this farce.
Boys !
Keep away, don't touch me!
Good-bye, faggot!
Look at the baby!
- Which one's free?
- The first.
What are you doing?
She goes to Maternity Wing.
Come with me.
Why are you taking her away?
- What's your name?
- Nunziatina.
Dear Nunziatina.
She's adorable. Nunziatina.
- Good morning, Mother.
- Good morning, girls.
Come here. Sit on the bed.
Like that. Atta girl.
Here's the pot.
- A change of baby clothes.
- Thank you, Mother.
- Hey, I know you.
- I know you too.
You're Adelina from Forcella.

- What are you in for?

What's your name?

What're you in for?

Aren't you going to ask me?

What'd you do, Tit-zzeria?
Insulted a peace officer.
Atta girl !
Come on, eat up.
You've had nothing all day.
- Are they fresh?
- What do they look like?
180 for taralli is expensive enough.
- Plus the tax for Adelina's fine...
- What can we do?
Shave and a haircut, 450.
I always paid 350.
- The tax for the fine.
- Oh, yeah.
Looking for me?
Cleopatra, remember the tax for the fine.
Yeah, I know.
Don't bother, I'll pay.
Give me the change.
3 beers today, 2 orangeades
yesterday. Here.
- Thank you.
- Thanks, Brigadier.
He pays the 'fine tax' too.
That's £ 40,690. Wanna count it?
Is there hope of collecting
 the full amount?
£ 40,000 only rebates the
jail term by eight days.
Counselor, in a week, two at most...
I'll slap down on this table £ 300,000.
Even more!
Are you sure?
Counselor, the people of
Forcella is world class!
They've risen up in a...
fraternal embrace.
This gesture almost makes you forget
how filthy and ignorant they are.

How long for her criminal conviction?
About 4½ months.
Gentlemen,
the press can do a lot to mobilize
public opinion and solicit the authorities,
because:
either a pardon comes swiftly...
...or it's useless.
There's just no pleasing you!
Oh, yeah? Where's the Release Order?
What am I the Attorney General?!
- You're the God of bastards!
- Bastard ?
Fine's paid, sure!
But who'll serve the time?
Don't make me laugh.
Here, they say, pardons are never granted.
Amnesty! That's the thing!
I'm doing 4 months,
but that's nothing to you...
...you're outside!
- Oh, come on!
- Calm down, young man.
I can't sleep nights
because of urges.
The real urge of desire!
I can't wait for you to get out.
- I finished the cure.
- Shut up, the cure ?!
That's just talk.
When you had to do the deed,
you ran off to Mama.
You got dizzy spells.
Beat it!
A pardon ?!...Fat chance !
As if they cared about me in Rome!
Go, don't come again!
I don't wanna see you!
Please go, young man.
Adelina.
Sbaratti.
Natali', what is it?
Good news, sister.
- Sbaratti!
- I'm here. What is it?
What happened?
You've been pardoned. You're free!
Oh, madonna mia!
I don't believe it.
Pardoned?
The notice came last night.
The warden didn't want to tell you
until he double checked it.
Pardoned?
So it's true!
I'm pardoned! I'm free!
Fragulella, I'm free!
Come here.
I'm so happy.
Don't forget about us
when you get out.
- Say hello to my mother.
- Come and see me.
- Carmine and the kids'll be so happy.
- I'm going to eat them all up!
- Pardoned.
- Sbaratti.
If you wanna leave with the
first bunch, you gotta move.
What time is it?
It's after 11:00.
There's so much to do.
Papa, when's Mama coming out?
You heard the lawyer.
We have to wait.
Will they let her out today?
Let's hope so.
Stop it!
Now they'll know you
in this neighborhood, too!
Behave yourselves
or they won't let Mama out.
-Papa?
-What?
When you go to jail,
will you take me with you?
Sure.
Hurry, Counselor Verace
is in the visitor's room.
Five minutes.
Soon as I dress the kids.
It's noon. What do you think, Mr. Carmelino?
Will your wife make it out
with the first group?
Stop it!
There's Mama!
Idiot, you made my heart skip a beat.
I thought it was really her.
Is this the most exciting
day of your life?
Sure is.
Did the good news
catch you unawares?
No, I was prepared.
Were the kids pleased?
Bursting out of their clothes
with joy. Such a hullabaloo!
Yelling: "Our mother is coming back!"
Dancing. Jumping.
- Papa, I'm tired.
- I'm hungry.
I gotta pee-pee!
They're too young
to understand.
Of course, and it's a long wait.
How will you show your
gratitude to the president?
Send him a handwritten letter
from me and my wife.
There's Mama!
Again?
Shut up or I'll smack you!
Wait!
Wait for me!
What can I say?
I don't know anything.
Watch out for the tram!
Trying to scare me to death?
Driver, over here!
The car is ready.
We're going by automobile?
Come on, kids.
Got,em!
Come on in!
Pardons guaranteed in 15 days.
One third up front
and the rest upon delivery.
Miss? Guaranteed pardons.
You look a bit worried.
[PETITIONS FOR PARDON ACCEPTED]
These cheap flowers ?!
Carnations are 80 apiece.
I'd throw 'em back in your face,
 if you gave them to me.
Fine, I'll present them to her.
Look, look!
Pardons guaranteed! 15 days.
One third up front
and the rest upon delivery.
Thank you all!
Long live the neighborhood
of Forcella!
You look wonderful!
Enrico, come here.
Go see who it is.
- Who is it?
- It's Fortunata.
We're going to the port, to get
the new shipment of cigarettes.
What should I do?
Fortuna', it's my first day of freedom
and it was my first night
after a long time.
- I wanna rest a bit.
- Sure, stay here.
- We'll see you tomorrow?
- Yeah, today I'm off.
Usual spot, tomorrow, though.
Don't be mad.
Don't worry. Counselor Verace'll
fix me up. He promised!
- Okay.
- Good bye.
They're gone.
- Mama.
- Come to Mama.
I'm smothered in children!

Man! So early in the morning
and already blocked by traffic!
Hmm, my dears, take your time!
By all means, nice and easy!
Call yourselves workers?
You shoulda stayed in bed...
At least Sunday mornings
In 3 days, I have the concert.
Two hours sleep, guaranteed.
Thank goodness.
Tomorrow morning's
the Senator's funeral.
I absolutely must put in an appearance.
At 10:00, the Ladies' Committee of Benefactors.
Lunch with the in-laws.
Evening with the Americans.
The next morning...
The next morning?
Oh yes, Father Astolfi's orphans.
Then the hairdresser's.
Drop in on Bicky.
Then an hour at the gym.
Back to the hairdresser.
Stop by Bicky's again.
And then those wretched
orphans' awards.
Enough, enough!
Away! A clean break.
Definitive!
Renzo, right now I can't remember
the color of your eyes.
Darling! With his serious face.
He's the best man I know.
So generous, so free, so unworldly!
Poor dear...
in his incredibly short socks.
There he is.
Right there.
-Ciao.
-Ciao.
- Am I late?
- No, I just got here.
- Where shall we go?
- No idea. You decide.
It's hot. Mind if I open the top?
No.
Were you stunned by my call?
No, I was expecting it.
If you hadn't called,
I would have.
If you've got time,
how about a drive in the country?
Yes. I have all the time you want.
- Is that your husband?
- Yes.
In what part of the world
is he now?
Stuttgart -- for his EEC stuff.
He'll be away for another week.
How does it feel, seeing ads
with your name in the street?
I don't even notice anymore.
Besides, my name is Anna.
Don't you remember?
Really, Renzo, you've changed
since last night.
You seem not to know me.
No. It's just that
when I saw you arrive,
it took my breath away.
Oh, charming !
Renzo.
After you took me home last night,
I couldn't sleep.
The things you said to me.
I don't think I've ever felt so unhappy.
- Why?
- Because you're right.
I've lived like a puppet, blind, deaf,
without undersanding...
others peoples' reasons.
I suddenly realized it
as I was dancing with you.
I felt alive for the first time,
in your arms.
Oh, come on !
Let's close the top.
- Scared someone might see you?
- No, I meant for your sake.
Besides, it could happen.
If you're worried about my husband,
you can relax.
You say it with regret.
No one likes living with an addict.
I didn't know.
Yes, an addict. Not in the
sense you think, but worse.
He's a cog in the machine:
Work, success, money.
Money, success, work.
He can't stop.
There's no room for anything else.
And, you're different?
I am different.
I realized it thanks to you, Renzo.
No, no.
I think I spouted
a lot of nonsense last night.
Hey, you (speed) demon!
Why, what's changed?
Anna, how many (£)billions do you have?
What's that got to do with it?
A lot.
You're mean!
Hey, slow down!
Would you like to drive?
Go on, Renzo, you drive.
No, I don't know these cars.
I can barely drive a Fiat 600.
This one's really easy, you'll see.
No, I'd better not.
Come on, Renzo.
Let's change places.
- Come on.
- But...
It's perfect, you'll see.
It does 190(Kmh) like it's nothing.
It had a fresh tune-up
this morning.
The key is there.
Go.
Where's the turn signal?
Oh, here it is.
-A little music?
-Uhuh!
Well, Renzo?
Anna, I like you a lot.
But you don't think I'm sincere, do you?
I don't know.
Look, the gas gauge is red.
No, that's the heater.
I filled up this morning.
- How much does this beast hold?
- 80 litres... 100, I don't know.
Wow, mine could go
around the world on that much!
Do you like to travel? So do I.
Whenever I can, I run far,
far away from everything.
I'm so tired of my world,
and the people in it.
There's an oasis in Africa,
near Marrakesh. It's divine.
You live on sun and fruit,
lots of fruit.
- 1,200,000.
- What?
600,000 there and 600,000 back.
- Enough, Renzo, knock it off.
- It's the truth.
The truth is you always turn
to discussions of money!
You throw it in my face,
as if it were my fault.
Anna, know how much I earn a month?
No, I don't want to know.
You don't get it. I like you
precisely because you're different.
Not like those automatons around,
who accumulate money all day long.
You write, you're intelligent.
You're interested in many things
I never think about money,
Renzo. I swear.
Because you have it.
What can I do,
throw it out the window?
Yes, throw it all out the window:
Money, cars, jewelry,
those Cleopatra bracelets.
I got these at a hardware store,
if you must know.
Got this 'road hog' at a
hardware store too?
Anyway, that's not it. The fact is,
money has gotten inside you.
Inside me there's only a void,
a great void.
I thought you could help me, Renzo.
Where do you want to go?
- We could go to my place.
- Your place?
My villa's 10 Kms from here.
It's not bad. There's even a lake.
- Where? What lake?
- Just a tiny one.
My husband had it made
so he could fish for trout.
- I'll take you on the River Po.
- Oh, yes! Is it lovely? What's there?
Mosquitoes.
At least THEY weren't
made by your husband.
I'm sorry.
Let's go anywhere.
Wherever you like.
As long as there's a bit of
peace and tranquillity.
There, look. Stop. That's fine.
Hmm, how wonderful!
[Radio]
<i>Our jazz program continues...
In a few days, even this lovely
October will be finished.
Get a load of that!
Not here, please. Let's go.
Don't give it up too easily!
My God!
You like me. I can feel it.
Anna, if you didn't call me this morning,
who would you have called?
Nobody.
I'm alone.
With all those people around you?
With all those people around me!
I can't tell which are your fingers
and which are mine.
This is so lovely, Renzo, incredible.
- I—
- Renzo, help me.
Let's go far away, to the sun.
To Rome, to Naples.
Yes, let's go.
We'll arrive at night, in the lamplight.
The water, still as silk.
We'll hire a carriage and find
a nice small place,just for us.
The black sky, full of stars.
And music, lots of music in the air
through the streets, under our windows.
Tomorrow we'll wake up
really late with the sun...
as it creeps into bed
and over your eyes.
You take me in your arms.
You caress me.
You sqeeze me so tight.
- Anna, are you hurt?
- No, it's nothing.
It's burning!
The car!
My God, what have you done?
Nothing, he came out
on the road, I had to brake.
Something's burning!
Madonna, the tire's burning!
Move, do something, you lump!
The car's on fire!
Find something to put it out!
How could anyone be so stupid!
Are you nuts, with MY fur ?!
Try YOUR jacket.
Madonna, the whole thing's
going to blow!
The jack, get the jack out!
Oh, God.
It's wrecked, ruined.
- What are you doing?
- The trunk won't open.
Oh my God!
The jack, I said!
You must know what a jack is!
You must have slammed
on the brakes like a brute!
These cars are delicate.
They're jewels. Jewels!
You slam on the brakes
like it was a truck!
I could've killed that guy!
Who, that 'speed bump' ?!
What are you doing now?
Resting?
Hallo, I say...
Would you be so kind as to lend
a hand? I'm in a spot of trouble.
I think it may be serious.
Certainly, how can I help?
What's wrong?
I don't know. If you'd be
so kind, come have a look.
What happened?
Nothing.
We were going rather fast...
At one point we had to
brake hard and swerve...
Now it's stuck, I don't know what to do.
- It's a Rolls.
- Oh, yes, latest model.
Are you happy with it?
Oh yes, no problem till now.
Pretty banged up !
Were you driving ?
No.
It was all so sudden. The car
swerved and went off the road.
Strange, these cars are perfect.
I was a fool to leave it
in the hands of someone...
who, until yesterday,
drove a Fiat-600.
- Enormous error !
- Perfectly right !
- Would you like me to help?
- Goodness, no.
You see, these cars
with rim-braking—
I've always gone for disk brakes.
Everything's always smoother.
It's not a question of brakes.
It's knowing how to drive.
Even The Divine Comedy
in the hands of an illiterate...
- Hey?...
- Indeed.
Well, let's hope for the best.
Oh, don't worry.
Fortunately, it's very fixable.
Haven't we met?
Your face isn't new to me either.
We may have met in Casorate,
with my husband...
the last week-end at the Martins'.
Is your husband in Milan?
No, in Stuttgart.
On EEC business.
He'll be away for another week.
Thank heavens, with this disaster!
Better call a mechanic.
Certainly.
That guy's totally useless.
If you like, I can drive you home.
Please, allow me. I'm Giorgio Carate.
Gladly. Very kind. Thank you.
Listen, I'm going home.
This kind gentleman's taking me.
We'll send a mechanic right away.
Ciao.
Oh, keep an eye on it.
Do me that favour?
Thanks.

Daughter of Beauty everlasting!
You're a garden of loveliness.
Mara!
Quiet! Don't shout!
- Mara, you're a garden...
- Let's go in the room.
No, I'll come by later.
I brought these trifles...
just so I could see you,
kiss you, touch you.
Wait, Mara!
Listen, I have to go to the Ministry.
Queen! Empress! Sultana!
Unfortunately when I love,
I sweat.
Use and discard.
Sorry.
Very convenient, very modern.
Wait till tonight. Then you must
make me die, I insist.
Count on me, Bolognese.
- What's gotten into you?
- I want to die right there!
For now I need to be strong.
I must resist!
- How CAN I resist?
- Shut up!
- Ciao.
- Ciao.
Listen, Mara.
Tonight, put this on.
I want to find you dressed
like this -- as  a schoolgirl.
What, are you crazy?
You're killing me!
You call me uncle.
I'll call you my little niece.
What's with you nutty Bolognese?
What sort of kick do you get?
I need a lot of tenderness, Mara.
Next time, I'll wear a little
suit with short trousers.
You'll sing me a lullaby...
and I'll fall asleep like this,
in your arms.
I gotta run to the Ministry...
or my father will kill me.
- What?
- Can I phone him?
- Sure.
- The phone.
Miss? Bologna. Urgent.
Very urgent!

Having a good laugh?
Where is your seminary?
At Anagni, but the seat is in Lombardy.
- How many hours do you study?
- Twelve hours.
Get outta here !...
5 hours of meditation and prayer a day,
7 hours of study.
When do you have fun?
After lunch we have recreation,
and an evening chat session.
I have a nephew with the friars.
They get him up at midnight to say the rosary.
The Capuchins practice that rule.
No, thank you.
Not allowed to smoke?
Once I saw a bishop with a pipe.
It's forbidden at seminary.
You know,
you make me feel like confessing.
In this lovely twilight.
I couldn't.
I'm not a priest yet.
In two years I take my vows.
- You're already dressed as a priest.
- Doesn't mean I am.
Black is my favorite color.
I wear it a lot...
on top and underneath. In summer...
Say,
is it true that after the 'Council'
priests will marry?
No, I don't believe so.
American priests
have kids hanging off them.
What can I say,
they don't inspire confidence.
Priests should be like the moon:
You can know them, but not reach them.
They're men with a religious vocation.
My nephew's mother
beat the vocation into him.
You do it because you like it?
Yes, but I'm free to choose.
I have plenty of time before my vows.
My saint will inspire me.
- Which one?
- Saint John.
I have one nobody's heard of.
Saint Maurillo. Do you know him?
No.
I need one that nobody pesters.
Who has some time for me.
I always ask to make lots of dough.
Does he answer ?
Pretty much.
But I don't like my job.
What do you do?
Manicurist.
But I hand-pick my clients.
Respectable people who pay well.
I want to buy my father some land.
I've seen SO many hands !
I know people by their hands.
Let me see yours.
You're level-headed and you like sports.
I've played inside forward. But now...
Ssh, Umberto, there's a great destiny here.
- I can tell you're kind.
- How can you tell?
By everything.
You're marked for greatness!
Look.
Damn, what a straight line!
You can ask whatever you like of life.
I'd like to go for a stroll
with you tomorrow.
Yeah sure, arm-in-arm.
Think of the neighbors. The concierge...
...your grandmother.
Dressed as a priest, to boot!
I have a 'civilian' suit.
It's a bit old...
We'll go to the sea. Ostia?
I wouldn't mind that,
now that it's not so crowded.
We'll stay the whole day.
I'll bring sandwiches too.
We'll see. We'll see.
Oh, kitty! Puss-puss...
Come here, you.
I'm supposed to leave tomorrow,
but I can be a day late.
- When will you be back?
- At Christmas.
I'll see my grandparents
on the way home to Lucana.
About going to the sea,
I'll sleep on it tonight.
Kitty! You're a big kitty.
Wonder who he belongs to.
From time to time he comes to see me.
Nice kitty. Good puss.
It was so nice out here...
I'll wait, if you like.
This one may take a while.
He's from out of town -- Bologna.
Here on business.
I'll be here, waiting for dawn.
I'll leave you the cat.
Go.
Ciao.
Good night.
- Umberto, why aren't you in bed?
- I'm going, Grandmother.
Excuse me.
- Good evening, ma'am.
- I don't know you!
You do now.
I don't know you, nor does my grandson!
Umberto, go to bed!
Good night, miss.
Tomorrow, I'll raise a wall here.
Good thing he's leaving tomorrow.
Grandmother, I won't go until
you apologize to the lady!
I'd rather die!
Miss, I'm sorry.
Don't mention it.
Leave this child in peace.
He's hardly one of those
who frequent your house.
This is a holy child !
In my house you'll find only serious,
important people!
You want to know who's ringing now?
The son of Labor Minister Rusconi!
A fine thing!
In my house you'll
even find Congressmen!
Oh, they're a good lot !
Even Tommasi, the pasta magnate.
I see you eat Tommasi pasta.
I won't anymore.
Tomorrow I'll circulate a petition to the tenants.
Everybody'll sign it.
You will leave this building!
We're fed up with this coming and going.
You're a scandal !
Yesterday I counted four men!
You wanna put a curfew on me?
A taxi-meter ?
3 men OK -- 4 no?
My clients are well-behaved
and they tiptoe about.
You'll go to hell, mark my words.
Shame on you. I'll report you!
Stop it, Grandma!
You're an old goose!
You hear that, Vincenzo?
Umberto, take that back!
Drop dead, you old whore.(ruffiana)
How dare she ?!
Vincenzo! GET AWAY !!
Senile bitch on my case, now!
She'll report me to hell !
Why do I get'em all ?
What's with all the ringing?
Damn the souls of your dead ancestors!
Finally! I was getting scared.
What's with the ringing?
- Gorgeous!
- Come in.
I thought -- gas... A gas leak.
The Hell you say !
Hi kitty ! Is he new?
I'll put the old bat through Hell !
I'll fix that kid right up.
What kid? What old bat?
Next door. It bugs her if
I talk to her grandson.
She's nuts! As if I'm the
type to go with a priest!
- What priest?
- He's not yet 18.
We're talking about God
and serious stuff, and
she starts, screaming
that I'm going to hell.
She gave me a headache.
Never mind her chatter, you'll go nuts.
"Do no harm, have no fear".
She'll tell the landlady
I have too many visitors.
So what?
Landladies are understanding.
At worst, she'll raise your rent.
As if I didn't pay enough !
Granny's gonna cry tears of blood.
I'll make sure of that!
Be more understanding.
Come here, come to Uncle.
As if I'm in the mood
for love right now !
Come on, Mara.
Let's go beddy byes
and snuggle up close.
- We won't talk if you don't want.
- I need to blow off steam.
Sure, how about in bed?
With this anger
I'd lie there like a stone.
Be honest, am I a scandal?
Do I do it on the terrace?
Fine by me. I can come on the terrace...
Like Nero facing Rome.
Don't I always ask everyone...
..NOT TO SHOUT !!...
to lower their voice ?
Except you howl like a wolf anyway!
Because I'm not like the others.
I love you.
I think you're perfect.
- I love you.[Bologn]
- Here.
I love you.[Italian]
- Let's run away together.
- Who's chasing us?
It's starting to bother me
that you go with other men.
Now I'm jealous.
Then marry me.
How does that follow?
Why don't you come to Bologna
for a month or two?
I'll never move !
I won't give her the satisfaction.
In fact, I'll buy this apartment.
That way she'll be stuck with me for life.
Mara, let's make love here.
It'd be divine.
We'll turn out the lights
and open the fridge.
See what a lovely, intimate light?
I'll write the old bag a letter.
I gotta vent.
I saw a wild show in Paris.
Black striptease. Totally black.
We'll need music.
This one's scented.
Imagine sending her
a scented letter!
Can I turn off the lights,
for a minute?
- I have to write.
- Just one minute.
- Oh ?
- One minute.
You gotta correct my letter, OK?
I don't want to give her the
satisfaction of finding any errors.
Yeah, sure.
The shapely leg of a woman
slowly comes into the light.
What's he up to?
The light creeps up slowly...
very, very slowly... higher
very, very, very slowly... up
It's enough to make you faint.
I was really excited.
They've got time to waste!(I don't)
Turn'em back on! ON !

You won't see me again.
I'm not a doormat!
I have my dignity too!
You're not the only
woman in the world.
I can find all I want out there.
Sit down! Be good.
You take advantage, because
you think I'm a slave to sex.
I have a soul too. Remember.
The only difference between
a devil and a saint is one hair !
My life's about to change.
I'm leaving for Bologna to find a wife.
'Course, you should get married.
Dear Madam...
What: "Dear" ?!
My father might call.
I left him your number for emergencies.
Tell him I'm out.
-Fake a man's voice.
-Uhuh.
Good-bye.
Oh!
I said I was sorry, what else do you want?
To hit me in the head with a hammer?
This isn't a hotel where you come and go.
Get up, I have to go shopping.
Mara, last night I went to Piazza Navona.
I sat on a bench.
I looked up at your window.
At some point I couldn't take it anymore.
So I went with a—
- Streetwalker?
- Yes.
You can't skip just one day?
Mara, I swear there's nothing between me and her.
Suddenly something inside stirred.
And I yelled at her, "Get out of here!"
Then she got offended !
She was right, poor thing.
I'd already paid her 5,000 lire!
Even they have dignity.
You must be understanding.
Come on, get up.
Thank you.
Couldn't you put a rug down there?
A soft red runner.
I'll buy it for you.
Mara.
Listen, Mara.
In an hour I go see the Undersecretary.
We've never been together in the morning.
One hour.
One little hour, huh?
Oh, all right.
Don't undress!
Quit yelling, the witch'll hear!
It was YOU who compromised me.
I want to undress you.
You're a vision! Look at her!
Know how I'd like to see you?
In a fur coat, in the sun nude.
In this heat?
Are you nuts?
You're so conventional.
Hello?
[Venetian accent]
Vani from Venice! Holy smokes!
Sure, I remember:
Short, mustache, Fascist.
You're a Fascist, no?
I remember.
Try tomorrow.
Sure, you'll get my vote.
I promised. Long live the "Duce"!
[Italian]
Who you voting for?
Beauty of beauties!
I'll find out the old witch's party
and get my whole family to vote
against it. There are 7 of us.
8 with me, light of my life!
Hey? Gonna be all day?
It's difficult and I'm shaking.
Let me have look over there.
Hey, look at that!
He's taken off his cassock!
Imagine the old bag's reaction!
Attaboy!
Kid's got character.
Come see.
Attaboy!
Ciao.
I'll shoot him!
Shoot...
Mara, please.
If you laugh it turns me off.
It's a serious, sacred thing.
Best thing in the world.
You're so cute.
- You're not home !
- I'll look through the peephole.
- It's the grandmother.
- Don't answer. You're out.
With a face like that, I bet she's armed.
I'll get the door.
- Who is it?
- Open up!
- But who is it?
- I'm Giovanna Ridenzone.
- Never met her.
- Umberto's grandmother.
Yes ?
I need to speak with you.
Just for a minute.
I must speak to you.
Too early for visitors.
Madam!
Come in.
It's over.
What is it, madam?
It's all over.
Don't cry.
You've ruined me.
You've ruined my family.
If you'll stop crying, madam,
we can fix everything.
Just stop crying, madam.
He was a golden boy, respectful, obedient.
Now he's lost his head.
Calm down, we'll fix it.
There's nothing can be done.
He put brilliantine in his hair.
He took his cassock off.
I'll throw myself out window!
Right in the middle of Piazza Navona.
Please calm down, madam.
- Where's the window, I'll jump.
- Madam.
Rusconi.
Calm down.
- Mr. Rusconi.
- A pleasure.
You don't understand.
Umberto used to study all the time.
He even read at night.
You know he could have become Pope?
He will, become...
Come, madam.
Come sit in the parlor.
Rusconi.
Please, madam, don't cry.
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.
Give the lady a Fernet.
It'll do her good.
Or would you prefer something sweet?
I have Strega, Kümmel, Anisette...
whatever.
He won't go back
to the seminary.
We'll make him go back.
I'll see to it.
He says you're a saint and I'm a witch.
You can go now, Rusconi.
Grandma's feeling better.
Wait in the other room.
Use the phone if you like.
Go on, dear.
- Did I disturb you?
- No.
The gentleman is very kind.
He's from Emilia.
- I have relations there.
- That's nice.
Listen, you can tell your grandson
whatever you like about me.
- Even the truth.
- I have, but he won't believe me.
- Keep trying.
- Thank you.
You see, Umberto's parents
have such great hopes for him.
He's their only hope.
My daughter has a weak heart.
You know what it means
to have a son?
- I'd like a son, y'know.
- Good girl.
First I have to put some money away,
so he'll be provided for.
Good for you!
You know what I'll do?
I'll take a vow.
Vows always work for me.
If your grandson
returns to the seminary,
I'll go a week without.
"Without", get it ?
Yes, you're too generous.
I'll go one week, without.
I really mean it.
I'll buy some candles, make little
altar, and keep'em lit day and night.
Madam, you'll go straight to heaven!
- It's a sacrifice for me.
- I can imagine.
But I'll do it gladly.
It'll cost me about... £ 200,000
Goodness, one can earn that much?
More, if I wanted.
If I don't like a man,
I don't even open the door.
Darn right!
Who's this?
Yes, Miss Mara's residence.
No, she's gone.
She'll be back for Christmas.
Ciao.
- Cin cin!
- Cheers!
- Who was that?
- A Sicilian.
- I'm leaving.
- No, come here.
Chat a while with the lady.
Do you want a Strega?
-Where are you going?
-Be back later.
Sorry if I interrupted you.
Don't mention it.
This girl is an angel.
Yes, she's very good.
See you later.
No. Pour the lady another drop.
Want another?
God, no! My head is spinning.
Listen.
Do you know...
I never had any grandparents?
Strange.
I would have loved
to have a grandma like you.
How about you?
I have three grandmothers.
No!
Yes. Good-bye.
Glad to have met you.
So am I.
Don't slam the door!
Dear, where were you born?
We're all from Lucania.
I'm from Anticoli. Anticoli Romano.
May I help you madam?
Yes, I'd like six
of these nice candles.
<i>Reverend, the attachment is no longer
like a bayonnette, it screws on.
<i>Our Bishop'll like this a lot.
<i>Marvelous. Look, it's
actually hand chiselled.
<i>- Do you like it? You too, Reverend?
- Yes, we'll take it.
What are you doing here?
Come in.
- How much?
- 1,800 lire.
- Any discount?
- No.
What did you pop out of?
Just passing by.
Can I buy you a present?
This would suit you.
Madam, how much is this?
18,000 lire.
- What would I do with that?
- What a question!
Keep it as a souvenir.
Wear it when you get your own parish.
You made a deal with my grandmother.
She's an angel. But it has
nothing to do with it.
Pay at the cashier, madam.
Last night I had a vision. Saint Maurillo.
What's got into your head, my boy?
You know I could almost be your mom?
Come, try on this surplice.
Ooh, this would really suit you!
You're just not made for
those clothes. Understand?
Once I fell for a Marshall
in the Corps of Engineers.
His uniform made my head spin.
In civilian clothes,
he was sombody else.
He looked like a plucked chicken.

- Do you have to put the candles there?
- What do you care?
Don't you have any faith?
Aren't you from our church?
And how!
We should blow them out now, darling.
You're right.
- Do you have any Coca Cola?
- Yes.
- And eggs?
- Yes.
- What day is it today?
- Thursday.
We'll go out Saturday. We'll see
daylight again on Saturday!
The phone!
My father's supposed to call.
Ooh!
- What is it?
- The shutters!
- Madam!
-(Here we go again!)
Madam.
Was that the old lady?
No, the wind.
Get outta here!
Madam, he wants to join the
Foreign Legion. He's packing.
We must stop him.
He's gone mad!
I'm coming.
Rusconi, come here!
Help me climb over.
Rusconi!
Come on.
Umberto!
- Give it to me!
- No!
- Give it to me!
- Let me go. Bad, bad boy.
What are you doing, Umberto?
Where are you going?
Tell him I'm not a liar.
I told him the truth.
Grandma told the truth.
The whole truth.
Why do you want to make me feel guilty?
I never have before now.
The seminary is a secure life.
Bread, a bed and you're
out of this ugly world.
If I could be born again,
I'd be a nun.
- Grandpa, give me the case!
- No, I won't. Bad boy!
You're hurting me, Umberto!
Bad boy!
I want to go away! Understand?
Rusconi!
Rusco.., come outta there!
Mr. Rusconi!
Don't just stand there. Come on!
Come on, move!
Hey, kid.
Kid.
Let go of the case. Come now!
Finally!
This is Mr. Rusconi.
- Ridenzone.
- It's a pleasure.
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.
Tell him I wasn't lying.
In this world you can't trust anybody...
except parents and grandparents.
Is it true you earn more
than a million a month?
It's true.
You hear that, Umberto?
He wouldn't believe me.
He said I made it all up.
Madam, don't spread it around
or Mara can have problems
if the tax man finds out.
Good point.
Try telling the tax man that
relatives eat up most of your dough.
The train leaves at 5:00.
We'll take him to the station.
Rusconi has a car.
If we go now,
there's the Intercity bus.
Yes, there is a bus.
I've seen it.
Umberto understands the situation.
Isn't that so, Umberto?
Don't be condescending!
He's right.
Why are you crying?
This whole family is always crying.
Yes, son. Cry.
God's Grace has answered my prayers.
Thank you, madam.
Thank you.
There they are!

I'm so happy!
You should be happy too.
You did a good deed.
Yes, I'm happy to have a clear conscience.

Close the blinds.
I won't budge from here.
I'll stay in your bed
for all eternity.
I'll sprout roots and fungus
can grow on me. But I won't move.
- Don't shout!
- Let's put on a record.
Get undressed.
I'll watch and admire you
from here.

We can't, Auggie..!
We have to wait a week.
What?
I'm sorry. What can I do
about it, sonny boy?
What do you mean you're sorry?
Don't make that face.
Be understanding.
I made a vow.
How can I be understanding?
It's enough to make me cry too!
You want to drive me crazy!
I'll smash everything here!
Sweetheart. My darling Augusto,
a vow is a vow. Eh?
We're through!
Our relationship is DOA and RIP!
A week goes by quickly.
You won't see me again.
I'm a serious person, not a child.
It's a question of decorum.
Can't you make a sacrifice?
It'll be even better afterwards.
Come in the kitchen, I'll make coffee.
Forget the coffee.
Here's your wallet back.
- The tie, too.
- Why?
- And the handkerchief.
- But why, Auggie?
- Good-bye.
- Don't be like that.
Augusto.
I drove 500 kilometers for this.
Come on, get serious!
I AM serious.
- You're not!
- Don't go!
You want to commit sacrilege?
You feel up to it?
Fine. If you're not scared, let's go!
But I'll lie there like a victim,
like a slab of marble.
The responsibility's all yours.
You could have made the vow
for next month.
You knew I was here.
Ever since yesterday:
"Yes, no, yes, no..."
It's bad for a man's health,
this yes, no, yes, no!
Bologna!
Yes? 577-000.
Bologna?
Yes, it's me, papa.
We have to wait a little longer.
It still needs an official seal.
An usher told me.
No, papa!
I'll fly back tonight.
No, papa!
I've done everything I had to do.
I even handed out bribes.
But, papa,
you have to bribe in advance!
Well...
Come here.
No, I'm leaving.
Come on, keep me company.
He'll get you your permit.
Come on.
Don't be like that.
Augusto, come on.
Come.
