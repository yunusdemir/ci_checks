Nice taste you have.
And MR. Cheng?
Then we'll share
our thoughts later. .
Girls! Take care of our guest.
Thank you for coming.
Dieyi ! I am leaving too.
Girls! Come entertain our guest.
MR. Duan, this way please.
Long time no see.
MR. Duan. We've missed you.
I'd like to see Miss Juxian.
Ah, how shall I put it?
You should've said that earlier. .
She's not here at the moment.
What can be done?
how about this?
Caifeng, come keep
MR. Duan company.

I really want to
see her,
Tell me the truth.
Where is Juxian really?
Upstairs?
Or down?
The phoenix roosts on the
highest branches, of course!
But shes pretty high-class.
You reckon she'll go for you?
You bet!
I specialize in high-class.
Ah, Miss Juxian-
Bastards!
Okay, we're bastards!
You fucking bitch !
How dare you be so picky!
Cut it out!
Cause you are pretty!
Cut it out or I'll jump!
Jump!
I'll follow on your heels.
No matter where you are
even after death, I'll be there
Xiaolou!
These guys are revolting !
They were forcing me
to drink wine from their mouths.
Come on, assholes. Jump!
Now its your turn !
Bastards! Mother fuckers!
All right, lets go!
Oh, it's MR. Duan !
Listen, we're all here to have a
good time. . . spend lots of money.
So let's not pick fights, OK?
Eeechhh !
Keep out of it, and get lost.
Don't get upset.
Scared?
Juxian, you are to blame.
Didn't you tell these gentlemen
todays a special day?
That we decided to announce
our engagement today?
That's right!
Today is the ladys happy day.
Drink a toast to me!
Aren't you going
to offer congratulations?
You think you can fool us?
Gentlemen, on this,
my happiest day. . .
allow me to drink
to all of you!
And now,
something to sober you up.
I heard you got into a fight
at the house of Blossoms.
You know the old story. . .
about Panjinlians husband
Does this mean theres
a PanJinlian in your life?
What are you saying?
What do you want to hear?
I was just fooling around.
Come with me sometime.
You'll see what its like.
It'll be exciting.
I'm sorry. I really am!
I wasn't thinking.
I really put
my foot in it this time.
I'm a damn fool.
Have you forgotten
the secret of our success?
Don't you remember
our teachers words?
Which words were they?
Stick together
until the day you die.
I want you to be with me.
How about
we stay together until death?
We've come this far together,
havent we?
It's not enough. Should be a
lifetime.
One day, even one second less. . .
makes it less than a life time!
Dieyi, you really are obsessed.
Your obsession with the stage
Carries over into
your everyday life.
But how are we going
to get through the days. . .
and make it in the real world
among ordinary people?
Give me a hand with my makeup!
Concubine Yu
the song was sung everywhere. .
Out country is being ruined
by the enemy.
Go live out
this goddamn fantasy, then.
My king.
I'll tell you even though
it's heart breaking
Today is the day we
say goodbye
you'll become a lady of virtue!
Wake up.
You think
the wolves and tigers
won't recognize
your scent anymore?
I am scared.
Let me tell you something.
Once a whore, always a whore.
I'll keep that in my mind.
Fine. See you around.
MR. Duan has presented you
with a pennant.
The Beauty ofthe Age.
It reads,
What are you doing here?
What is it, Juxian?
Come on in !
No, you come out!
What are you doing barefoot
on such a cold day?
What's happened?
The house of Blossoms
won't keep an engaged woman.
Come. Let me introduce you.
This is Miss Juxian.
This is my stage brother, Dieyi.
You may have seen him
as Concubine Yu.
Xiaolou speaks of you so often,
I feel like we were old friends.
MissJuxian.
Excuse me, I must be going.
Xiaolou,
At the house of Blossoms. . .
if you had'nt caught me,
I'd be six feet under by now.
Remember, it was you
who proposed to me.
I'm used to hardship.
If you take me in. . .
I'll wait on you hand and foot.
If you ever abandon me,
I'll ki'll myself.
What a dragon lady!
Whens the performance of. . .
Candle-lit-night
in the Bridal Chamber?
Tonight.
Hold on. I want a formal
engagement ceremony. . .
to which the entire company
is invited.
I want to enter your home
as a proper bride.
You don't think I plan
to cut corners, do you?
The formal engagement
ceremony will be tonight.
Gentlemen, we request
the pleasure of your company.
Miss Juxian. . .
where did you study opera?
Me, what makes you think that?
Just the way youre over
playing your part.
Dieyi, shes going to be
your sister-in-law.
Also, at the engagement
party tonight. . .
I have'nt learned the opera
Gangster King and his Whore.
Our teacher never taught us
that one.
What are you talking about?
Dieyi, Xiaolou has spoken
good of you.
Don't leave!
Where are you going?
None of your business.
Xiaolou!
Please, don't go!
Master Yuan invites us tonight.
he wants to become our patron.
Who does he think he is?
No one tells me what to do.
I'm just a fake king.
You really are Concubine Yu.
Let him patronize you
if you like.
Xiaolou!
This feather headpiece
is rare and precious.
The feathers are collected
from the tails of live peacocks.
That's the secret. . .
to keeping the feathers
soft and colorful.
I'll be waiting for you.
In this world,
there is foulness
in both men and women.
only the bodhisattva embodies
both male and female essences.
Such ecstasy!
This sword has a history.
It once belonged
to the eunuch Zhang.
When Zhang went bankrupt,
I went to great trouble to acquire it.
I can see from this. . .
you're old acquaintances.
Amazing. one searches
far and wide for something. . .
Like it?
I-
Let's not have any vulgar talk
of money between us.
A precious sword is the classic gift
for ones most intimate friend.
What do you say?
MR. Cheng... wl'll you be
my most intimate friend?
The soldiers of Han
have invaded
The songs of Chu
Can be heard on all sides
Since the good king
has lost his fighting spirit
Why should his humble
concubine value her life
Don't!
It's a real sword !
A smile ushers in the spring.
A tear does darken
all the world.
How truly does this befit you.
To you. .
only you are possessed
of such charm.
Ah, MR. Cheng.
I knew you'd come.
We saved a seat
at the head table for you.
You came back?
It's a good thing
you showed up.
Have a look at this.
What a sword !
How did you acquire this
out of nowhere tonight?
Dieyi, you've come so late.
You better drink up!
Yes, drink up!
My gratitude, Miss Juxian.
Dieyi? MR. Cheng !
Xiaolou. . .
From now on, we'll no longer
perform together.
MR. Cheng, you can't do this!
This isn't- The fans won't-
This is terrible!
Japanese troops
have entered the city!
Dieyi. .
Where is Dieyi?
I'll fill up your glass
with finest wine.
Special wine.
So what is this wine called?
Wine of overnight
drinking.
Fill it up.
Who will be serving me
tonight?
Dieyi looks like lifting
his shoulders up. .
Cause a man's life is meaningless
it's like dream of spring. .
At your disposal. .
I will keep on drinking
until
this night is over.
Don't waste my time
just take it off.
Even if it belongs to your ancestor
you should let him put it on.
Understand me,
low life?
Tell the Japanese
I'll be there right away.
Hold on a moment.
It's not some private party.
They're black mailing you
to sing for them.
On the other hand, you're the
only one. . .who can save Xiaolou.
on the other hand,
If anything happened to you. . .
this theater of mine would-
All right, go then.
MissJuxian, what are you doing?
MR. Cheng isn't at home!
Wheres Dieyi? Dieyi?
hurry! I've heard the Japanese
feed prisoners to their dogs!
If you delay, he might not have
a life to save!
Dieyi !
But you allowed them
to take him away in the first place.
Xiaolou has looked after you
since you were small.
What are you saying?
Mr. Na, would you mind
leaving the room for a moment?
I have something to say to Dieyi
in private.
Everyone says Miss Juxian
is quite clever. . .
Were all trying to help Xiaolou.
Talk it over.
How about a clear answer?
Are you going or not?
Say something !
I know what's on your mind.
I have a proposal.
If you can get Xiaolou
out of there in one piece. . .
I'll go back
to the house of Blossoms.
I'll keep away from both of you.
hows that?
At the house of Blossoms,
you don't have to worry about much.
Life is a lot simpler there.
Just remember, you said it,
not me.
I give my word.
The flowers have blossomed
Their season is past
All has fallen
Only the sun is still the same.
Into ruin and decay
Xiaolou!
My brother!
Xiaolou, are you all right?
Did you sing
for the Japanese?
Theres one called
Aoki genuinely likes opera.
Xiaolou!
All right. Come here!
Let me have another drink!
okay. I'll drink one for you.
I think this opera,
Farewell, my concubine. . .
has turned into. . .
Farewell, my king.
The king's really irrelevant.
Drink this.
Your voice
will pierce the heavens. . .
Alright, come.
Forget the opera.
Let's just live a quiet life.
We'll have
a fat little baby boy.
Then I'll have everything
I want. That's enough.
No more opera.
Let's go!
Then, bye.
Give me the money back.
Not the crickets,
my money.
You borrow the money
on your host's credit, right?
Go!
I can't believe such a grown-up
like you is busy playing
with bugs and
not working !
Work?
I'm an actor.
What else can I do other than
acting on stage?
Shall I carry coffins?
You should be satisfied by now.
No need to shout like that!
Here's the money?
What? Don't need it?
I'll apologize
if I were going too far.
Unless you take caution,
they will get you.
The master wants to
see you.
No, I won't.
Look at this sword.
Master, they've
just arrived here.
Who?
Dieyi and Xiaolou whom
you've wanted to meet.
What a great fucking honor.
What the hell
they are doing here?
Well, I finally got something
to brag about.
A great fucking honor.
Take your seats there
and bow to me.
Master.
You are finally here.
Dieyi.
Without my help,
you are nobody.
And I left the stage.
Now it's your turn to
help me.
Hit me !
Come on !
Douzi !
Xialou!
You are now
all grown up
and
now great
actors with fame
Don't remember your youth?
what's worrying you?
Just hit him hard.
When did I tell you to
look down on me?
Are you going to ruin operas?
It's your fault!
Take this!
I'm to blame.
Blame me.
Wait.
I have to tell you this.
Xialou is my master.
If you want to hit him
you need my permission. .
Knock it off!
I've heard of one bitch,
and it was you!
So you must be the VIP
today, right?
Take your seat.
Feel at home drinking
some tea.
Alcohole, gambling and women. .
and even crickets?
You fucking ruined opera's
tradition !
Nothing's wrong to beat you with
a cigaret stick for your disgrace.
For an opium addicted brother. .
what is the crime?
Juxian !
It's not time for a whore
to interfere. .
Isn't it your way to hear
their excuse?
Shut the fuck up!
Don't be so stupid !
You are such a nice guy!
Hit him!
Unless you become quiet
I'll cut his throat!
Alright.
You kill one taking
two lives!
Your family will be over.
Did you just ask me
to stand up?
Xialou, are you
listening to me?
You are becoming a father.
If I stay away from
being an actor
I won't be able to buy
a birthday present for my kid !
Come closer!
Closer!
Practice!
Don't be slacking.
Stretch out your legs!
Wait.
This play is called Anger of Night.
You act Linchou for this.
He's head of the palace guard,
not some sneaky little thief.
Take this.
Attention, everyone!
This is what a great hero
is like.
A man does'nt
lightly shed his tears. . .
Unless his heart has broken.
Leave me alone. I'm just
taking master's purnishment.
The troupe has disbanded.
You leave too.
Master said that you.
Should learn how to endure
to become a great actor.
Everyone else has left.
You ought to go home too.
I was found on the street as a baby.
I've got no other home.
Do you know,
who found you?
No! They said if I knew, ld get
a swelled head and would'nt work hard.
Do you sti'll want
to sing opera?
Yes, even if I have to beg
to support myself! .
What's your name?
Xiao Si.
Xiao Si.

AS CHIANG KAl-SHEKS
NATIONALIST ARMY RETAKES BEIJI NG.
I hear the talk of the soldiers.
Xiao Si, go tell the manager
to avoid trouble.
And it is all about
running away.
What's this?
Why aren't you singing?
Don't make trouble!
Don't go, Xiaolou.
Waving flashlight is not
allowed in the theater.
Even the Japanese
didn't do this sort of thing.
Everyones here for the opera.
Please return to your seats.
Well put.
Back to your seats, everyone!
But can we let him get away
with speaking up for the Japanese?
Xiaolou!
Xiaolou!
Juxian !
We have to get her
to a hospital.
Save her first!
There was only
a minor disturbance.
Are you saying such a big
disturbance is minor?
You can fine us.
Why do you need
to arrest anyone?
The theater's been trashed,
people beaten. . .
and you sti'll want
to arrest him?
What for?
Cheng Dieyi betrayed the country
to the Japanese.
Move it!
On what base?
Teacher, teacher!
MR. Duan, I'm afraid
she's lost the baby.
Honey.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Go, help Dieyi.
If he's more important to you.
I don't know whether Dieyi
goes looking for trouble. . .
or if it's trouble
that comes looking for him.
Whenever you're with him,
my heart's in my throat.
Now that I've lost our child,
you're all I have left.
I don't care if I have to beg
with you on the streets.
All I ask. . .
is peace of mind.
If you help him now, we'll
no longer owe him anything.
Don't perform
with him anymore.
Promise me this.
No more performance
after this.
Master Yuan. . .
Dieyi's life is in your hands.
Count this.
If it's not enough-
If only you'll save Dieyi. . .
we'll give all our earnings
for the next three years.
You think I need your money
to keep my birds from starving?
And this gentleman is. . .?
Don't you recognize Xiaolou?
he plays the king
to Dieyis concubine.
Then it should be him
who saves Concubine Yu!
My dear man,
that s only a play!
All Beijing knows that Master Yu
is the true king of the theater!
It's true.
Speaking of which, I'd like to
ask MR. Duan something.
When the king returns
to see Concubine Yu. . .
how many steps should
he take?
Seven.
Show me.
Come on, show me!
Master Yuan.
Is this the honorable home
of MR. Yuan?
When a man called Cheng Dieyi
was arrested, he said. . .
the owner of this sword
would be able to rescue him.
Do you recognize it?
From your expression, I see
I've come to the right place.
Good. I'll put the sword here.
I'm so relieved
to have found its owner.
But sometimes one's hopes
are misplaced.
Master Yuan,
you must'nt blame Dieyi.
I see.
The reason why Dieyi
performed for Japanese
would'nt be by someone's
request, would it?
If it would, he wouldn't
have been arrested.
True!
There's a roomful of reporters
waiting at home.
Xiaolou,
MR. Na, lets go.
Wait, a moment! Let's talk.
Master Yuan asked me
to talk to you.
Tomorrow in court. . .
say the Japanese
put a gun to your head.
Say they tortured you.
Master Yuan has made
arrangements for everything else.
This is from Xiaolou.
Dieyi, don't be angry with us.
Xiaolous child. . .
It's died.
Your karmic partnership
with Xiaolou caused this!
After you get out of here,
just go your own way.
During the resistance
against Japan Cheng Dieyi
betrayed the country by performing
for Aoki and his colleagues.
You performed for their
immorality.
The defendant also
encouraged the enemy
and disgraced
your people.
Aoki continued
to resist even
after Japan officially
surrendered.
We've collected these pictures
as evidence. . .
and they confirm the defendant
sang for the Japanese.
We call on the witnesses Yuan
Shiqing, Duan Xiaolou and Na Kun.
The government has always
been good to me.
Nor would I betray the laws
of heaven or my own conscience.
Cheng Dieyi was taken away
in hand cuffs by the Japanese.
They put a gun
to the back of his neck.
He couldn't help. .
Duan Xiaolou!
It's true. The Japanese
beat up my stage brother.
Exactly as Master Yuan
has just described.
Na Kun?
