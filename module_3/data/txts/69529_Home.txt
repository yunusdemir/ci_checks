GEORGE: You mean to tell me that
James has deserted his family
for a bunch of gin-soaked celebrities?
You are turning into
one of Pavlov's dogs.
Every time you mention James, you snarl.
MATTHEW: Olivia Bligh,
will you marry me?
Yes, Matthew Goddard, I believe I will.
ANNA: Are we doing what I think we are?
Well, we can pretend it didn't
happen and have a good laugh.
Is it insane to suggest that
we might see where it may lead?
You want a man with balls.
Well, Dr. Duncan can't help you here.
The Japs cut 'em off in the war.
He's got nothing between his legs!
JACK: It's my worst nightmare,
the whole world knowing.
You must have some idea of what's ahead.
I spent three years regaining my sanity,
months earning your trust,
all to make reparation,
and once that's done
there's nothing but guilt for my crimes.
SARAH: She didn't drown.
She was dead
before she went in the river.
<i>Jack.</i>
[Gasps]
- You saw her?
- I nodded off for a sec. It's a dream.
I guess if she done herself in,
there'd be a note, eh?
"Dickie has returned and is
trying to break down the door.
He's threatening to kill me.
I fear this time he will."
Sir Richard Bennett, we're arresting you
for the murder of Mrs. Regina Bligh.
<font color="#0080ff">Synced & corrected by</font> kinglouisxx
<font color="#0080ff">www.</font>addic7ed<font color="#0080ff">.com</font>
It's not too close to the house,
but it's far enough in
to protect from vandalism.
And this view.
How was Reverend Curtis?
Practical.
Her headstone wouldn't last
a night in the cemetery.
SARAH: No.
All she needs now is justice,
and she can rest in peace.
Sir Richard'll have a slew
of barristers working for him.
And us against.
ELIZABETH: Welcome back.
As fraught as things are,
they're much less so for your arrival.
And I'm delighted that we're
keeping you in the family.
It's the only reason
I'm marrying him, actually.
Hello, darling.
I'm told to expect the date
for the d-i-v-o-r-c-e soon.
Then we'll apply for our visas.
Well, you stay here as long as you wish.
I fly out in a week.
Georgie and I will follow.
So soon.
Oh, please sit.
Now I know a little boy who'll
be very pleased to see you.
- David!
- Yes.
I'll leave you to talk.
Livvy, let's, um, have a chat later.
Shall we go and find David?
I'm going to teach him how to surf.
There's no waves here, buddy.
Oh, that doesn't matter, does it?
Anna's brought us up to date.
They're sure it was him?
If not murder,
then certainly manslaughter.
He was arrested
while you were traveling.
Matthew, please don't judge us
on recent events.
Not typical, then?
Not entirely.
Although we do have our moments.
What did Dad make of those?
I think he wondered
what on earth had struck him.
And then he'd give me
one of his wry smiles.
The very one.
Oh, you share so many of his traits.
Which bodes very well for you.
[Laughter]
He's missed his little friend.
Hello, Leah.
Hello, Mrs. Bligh.
I've missed mine. Sit.
You're the first person I've told.
Please, try not to be negative.
We're not rushing into anything.
We're just considering it.
And I want you to approve.
Jack's heading home.
He called.
He's still over the moon
about the arrest.
Well, let me know
if there's anything I can do
until he's back on deck.
Oh, he said he's coming straight in.
- To work?
- Mm.
Seems intent on biting the bullet.
Really? Well, I'm glad he trusts
our responses.
He must know that there'll be sniggers.
He's very brave.
I assume he's been supplementing
with testosterone.
I imagine so.
Manhood in a syringe.
Well, he would have been
the same man without it.
In temperament, perhaps.
Physically, definitely not.
He'd have been softer, rounder,
subtly feminized.
At least he has an injection
for his complaint.
Do you see yourself as having one?
It's how the medical fraternity
views me.
As someone to be cured.
Of a complaint.
And how do <i>you</i> see it?
If you don't mind me asking.
An affliction to be made the best of.
The world makes it impossible
to view it otherwise.
One day, perhaps.
An appealing fantasy.
You know, the irony is...
...if they offered me
an injection tomorrow,
I would throw it in their face.
I'd rather stay what I am
than let them think
they'd made me hate myself that much.
If you'll excuse me.
I know what you're thinking.
Henry is who he is,
and he hasn't shown
any interest in women.
[Child laughs]
But it was wonderful. Truly wonderful.
So sensual and caring.
Nothing brutish or, you know,
fumbly, like so many men.
And he didn't say no
to seeing where it might lead.
He was startled, yes, but then,
well, so was I
at having voiced the notion.
The parallels have to
have struck you, surely?
To?
James, William, and me.
A man who can't have the man he loves,
so he settles for his sister?
Look what misery that brought.
There are similarities,
but it's not the same.
You went into it blind.
I'm fully aware, and I don't
see it as a stumbling block.
If anything, it's an advantage.
We're both very independent people.
And when he needs a man?
Because he will. It's his nature.
Will you step aside and let him do that?
Obviously we'll decide
on our own parameters.
People do.
And it's just a very early notion.
A foolish one.
I'm sorry, this is nonsense.
- Olivia, you...
- No, I care for you.
- I fear for you.
- I can look after myself.
Can you?
You can afford to be smug.
You've found your man.
I never thought
you would begrudge me happiness.
You really are adrift.
Well, you sure know
how to surprise a man.
Well, is it really so surprising?
Oh, Matthew, I'm more than
comfortably provided for,
and I have a feeling that
your father would approve.
He'd have left it to me himself
if he'd wanted to.
Well, I'm not all magnanimity.
With the house,
you're more likely to return.
There must be some market
for surfboards here, surely.
There's a hint of one.
Let me think about it.
Are the keys in the car?
Yes.
I'm dashing in to see Henry.
Georgie's with Leah. He's fine.
Hey, Elizabeth just...
Later?
[Door opens]
I'd heard you were back.
Apparently congratulations are in order.
Tell me you don't share her insanity.
- Anna?
- Who else?
What's she said?
That you're actually considering
more than friendship.
Henry, it was a drunken night
after a taxing day...
It was actually quite marvelous.
- Certainly unexpected.
- Fine.
It made sense at the time.
But beyond that...
We're both alone, lonely, and
we can both do with the warmth.
You will never desire her.
And where has desire ever gotten me?
Tossed aside.
Affection has its place.
Think back to when
I discovered you and James.
Do you want Anna to suffer that?
She's not you.
Anyway, we're simply considering it.
Well, don't.
You both deserve better.
I have to be in the clinic.
Henry, I am begging you.
- Now is not the time for this.
- Please!
I'll see you out.
[Laughs] Careful, I'm a shark.
I'm coming to get you!
[Laughs] All right.
What's happened?
We'll do what's polite.
A few days.
Then we'll head back to the city.
Why must they always
complicate their lives?
What did Elizabeth have to say?
Nothing that can't wait.
I am going to miss them,
both hugely...
...and not at all.
[Brake ratchets]
You're sure you shouldn't do it
when you're fresh?
Won't make it any easier.
He'll be gone soon.
If he's waiting for Sheila.
I stay with the bottle
or I look people in the eye.
Why not start with the worst?
Doctor No Nuts.
You get one chance.
You've had yours.
Next time you'll be swallowing teeth.
You got it?
Pass it on.
[Engine starts]
There you are, Dr. Duncan.
Do you know, even though
I voted for you,
I'm thrilled you weren't elected.
You know, you're a very brave
man and a very dear one.
And now you're back,
I feel a lot more secure.
[Footsteps]
I'm only resting my eyes.
- It can wait.
- Come.
Have you seen our guests?
Matthew.
Olivia's sleeping.
She says a headache.
I shudder to imagine
what he thinks of us,
walking into this chaos.
Perhaps that's contributed
to Olivia's malaise.
Let's hope it all soon comes to an end.
It could draw out.
When the funeral's done
and I've tidied up in Canberra,
I'm thinking of
taking Sarah away, and David.
A break from all this.
To Europe.
To see James.
Oh, George, you have no idea
how glad that makes me.
Why be needlessly unhappy?
When he didn't return,
it seemed cowardice at first,
but perhaps he was simply exhausted
by the constant turmoil.
And facing us
would have only added to it.
Well, I didn't see that at the time.
First, the Riviera.
And then possibly Israel.
Sarah has a wayward niece
she needs to deliver.
And you?
I suspect I know
what you're contemplating.
Sharing a faith
would make it easier for David.
Would it cause a rift between us?
I can't ask you to accept James' choices
and deny you the right to your own.
But it goes against
so much of what we are.
A lot has lately.
I will try.
I know it's nothing
next to Papa's problems.
Yeah, well, Papa wants us
to put those aside.
This, however, is hardly trivial.
It's eccentric, to say the least.
- Well, viewed one way.
- Most ways.
Oh, this might sound harsh.
Are you sure
Henry wasn't closing his eyes
and imagining you were a man
to feel any sort of warmth for a time?
His eyes were open,
and he was making love to me.
And it was lovemaking. It wasn't just...
Fine, then.
That's what it was that once.
It's no guarantee for the future.
Can you at least promise
to proceed slowly
and not go charging in?
Oh, well, considering something
is hardly charging anywhere.
I want you to think
before you limit yourself
to a compromise relationship
simply to stave off loneliness.
Well, that makes me sound desperate.
Perhaps you are.
What's wrong with considering
something outside the drab norm?
You can do what you like, my darling,
but you can't assume approval.
Well, I thought
at least you'd understand.
What remains of your bohemian aunt may.
Your mother, however,
finds it quite disturbing.
What does it say
about where you are in life
that you're even contemplating it?
<i>He's hurt you.</i>
<i>I won't let him.</i>
<i>None of you.</i>
<i>Never again.</i>
SARAH: Jack.
Oh, sorry. I was miles away.
Please go home if you're not up to it.
They're doing <i>their</i> best. I can do mine.
I've been having, uh, flashes
of the night Regina died.
Just bits.
Blurry, hazy, strange.
- Of?
- Her.
I'm glad I saw Bennett arrested.
Otherwise I'd be doubting myself.
There was skin under her nails, right?
You could have got that anyhow.
At first I thought I was
imagining it, but...
The memories.
I saw her that night. Twice.
That's all I can remember.
What did I do?
<i>For every crime that went unpunished.</i>
She leant over me
with some sort of tool.
That's it. Just glimpses.
Surreal.
Then the sound of rowing.
It's connected with Regina somehow.
I'm not sure why, but I know.
Why would she be rowing a boat?
If she was fighting
the effects of morphine,
she'd have been euphoric.
She could have found the strength.
She...
What?
There's a way it all fits together...
...makes some sort of sense.
No, it does.
I know who killed her.
We're sorry for being mysterious.
We wanted proof first,
and we believe we have it.
Thanks to Matt.
I just lent a hand.
Not even sure why.
- I'll leave you to it.
- So will I.
But you're both family.
No more family secrets.
Not for me.
[Door opens]
[Door closes]
It is best they're gone.
GEORGE: Why all the subterfuge?
And what's Matt got to do with this?
We've spent the last two days
proving to ourselves
what happened to Regina.
There's a decision to be made.
You have no idea of the relief.
Once I'd have had to stay.
I didn't like keeping it from you.
There is always some intrigue or other.
I feel liberated.
You think the swine is innocent?
Of murder, yes.
We'll never know the exact events,
but it must have been
something like this.
He did force the morphine onto her.
[Muffled screaming]
SARAH: It was enough to bring on
confusion but not sleep.
She wandered off into the night,
probably to feel safe from any return...
...and she found herself by the river.
The drug would have been producing
a sense of elation by then.
The terror she'd felt, the hatred,
gradually ebbing away.
And then she came across Jack.
Jack!
JACK: [Grunts]
Up we get.
He's hurt you.
It's all right.
I won't let him.
None of you.
Never again.
GEORGE: Who knows
what she would have done
if she hadn't seen the boat,
or me, but she did.
And it made a crazy sense to her.
It all came together.
She went home.
She cut the telephone line to
make it look like he'd done it.
Then she wrote the note.
REGINA: <i>Dickie has returned,</i>
<i>and he's trying to break down the door.</i>
<i>He is threatening to kill me.</i>
<i>I fear this time he will.</i>
Then she found what she needed
and returned to Jack.
For every crime that went unpunished.
SARAH: Jack heard her
rowing out into the river.
[Water sloshing]
It might have been Bennett
rowing her body out.
No, he would have put the boat
back to avoid suspicion.
No, it was her.
She anchors the boat
to stop it from drifting.
[Thudding]
And then she hacked a hole
in the bottom.
Just enough to admit water slowly.
Then she took
whatever morphine was left.
A fatal dose.
She died before the boat sank.
She made it look like murder,
that Richard had tossed her
into the river
to cover his crime.
Everything pointed to him.
Regina returned to make amends
and killed herself to do it.
It's all supposition.
You mentioned proof.
Well, it took two days
for Matt to get equipment.
He just finished a dive.
[Bubbling]
[Water splashes]
SARAH: The boat's there, just
out from where Jack was lying,
with a hole in the bottom.
And the morphine bottle.
And the police know none of this?
No, and that's where
the decision comes in.
Do we tell them, or do we honor
Regina's sacrifice?
What are you suggesting?
Does the boat stay where it is?
We can't.
We can. If we choose.
I suggested it.
Don't think
we haven't struggled with it.
Add up every vicious thing he's done.
See this as punishment for all of them.
Regina died to remove him
from our lives.
But he didn't do it.
He's done a lot of other things.
And got away with them.
Much as I loathe the man...
We all do, and with good reason.
It's why we're here.
But it must be unanimous.
We've been torn apart
by differences too many times.
I'm happy to start.
Yes.
He drove Regina to it.
He effectively killed her.
If you need more time...
I don't.
For every woman he's raped.
Yes.
And me.
For all the lives he's ruined.
Regina died for us.
We owe her. I agree.
Mother?
You, please.
The man is evil.
But that's not a crime.
And he spurred her on,
but he didn't do it.
And he's been monstrous,
but he's never murdered...
...that we know.
But...
...what is wrong in peacetime
can be right in war.
And he declared the war.
So, yes.
Mother?
I betrayed my moral code
for an act of love.
I can't add to that burden
by doing so for hate.
The guilt would be too great.
My answer is no.
Although I understand
why yours were yes.
I'm sorry.
Inform the police.
[Door opens]
[Door closes]
O God, his mercies cannot be numbered.
Accept our prayers
on behalf of the soul
of thy servant departed
and grant her entrance into
the land of light and joy...
...in fellowship with thy saints.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Thank you, Reverend.
I feel we've done our Christian duty.
No one deserves an empty graveside.
Some come pretty close, but.
It's very progressive of the reverend
to officiate at all
in the circumstances.
ROY: Mm.
Dawnie would have been here,
just young Emma's
got her school concert on.
Everyone understands, Mr. Briggs.
I should have hung around a bit
longer that night, I suppose.
Oh, "should haves"
don't help anyone, Mr. Briggs.
Besides, you have
far better things on your mind.
- ROY: [Chuckles]
- How's it going?
Well, ask the doc.
Plain sailing.
Get ready for those sleepless nights.
Oh! Don't remind me.
Actually, I wouldn't mind a word, Doc.
If you'll just excuse us, ladies.
I haven't been ducking you.
Just I didn't know what to say.
Plenty don't.
Plenty won't.
Well, saying nothing's worst
of all, so I'll just say this.
You're no less of a man in my eyes.
You're a good bloke and a good mate,
and, uh, and there'll be
nobody else delivering my baby.
Henry.
So, what have you been thinking?
- I'm not pressuring.
- I know.
Whatever Olivia might think,
I'd like to at least see
where this might lead.
I'm going to be at the hospital later.
Maybe we should talk there.
I intend traveling to Sydney in
convoy with Matthew and Olivia.
I'm keen to test how far
Sir Richard Bennett's gratitude
might extend.
You shouldn't go alone.
It began just he and I.
It's the only way it might end.
Thank you, sweetheart.
How was it?
Well, we paid our respects. How's David?
He wore himself out
playing with Georgie.
There's a piece of cake up at
the house if you'd like one.
Oh, ace!
Um, a letter to Uncle Isaac.
What a change.
Even a month ago,
"a letter to Uncle" was said
with a barely suppressed groan.
I despaired
of keeping my promise to him.
Perhaps we should all go.
- To?
- To Israel.
Might help me make up my mind.
About?
You converted for love.
The least I can do is consider it.
I've had several craftily
arranged meetings with a rabbi.
Really? I don't...
I still have my reservations.
But if we deliver Leah together,
perhaps I'll find the answer.
The fact you even thought about it.
For you.
Well?
Well...
We'd be heading into uncharted terrain.
- You know that too, but...
- Oh, Henry!
I'm not some fool clinging to you
from emotional desperation.
I'm a woman who fell in love too early
with a man too different
who couldn't accept
that I can't have children.
And I went out with quite a few men,
looking for the one
who didn't hint family
as soon as we became serious.
For that one night with you,
I... I didn't feel so adrift.
Nor did you. I felt it.
So all I'm saying is that we
shouldn't run from the thought.
I don't know how to say this.
Truthfully.
I can't do it.
I'll need a simple reason, if you can.
This will hurt.
It's the only way
I'll stop badgering you.
I was about to say,
"Let's give it a whirl.
Build a fortress of our own."
Then why?
I didn't know you couldn't conceive.
[Voice breaking] Ohh.
Oh.
Only one thing has ever made me
consider marriage.
My own child.
It's what I still
can't reconcile about James,
that he would abandon his son.
We were an outside chance as it is.
I know.
We've no chance if this is the case.
- You insisted...
- I did. I did.
- [Sobs]
- Anna...
It seems I'm doomed by sterility.
That's harsh. It's true.
We might have been happy.
Who knows?
[Door opens]
[Sighs]
Are you sure you don't want me there?
Yes.
Ah, there you are.
We had to pry Georgie away
from cowboys and Indians.
I'm the sheriff.
- A very scruffy one.
- Shot you!
- Oh!
- [Laughs]
- Safe travels, Matthew.
- Ah, thank you.
I'm hoping the family
will be seeing you and Georgie
at Christmas before you leave.
We'll do our best.
Thank you, George.
Well, please try.
I sense her pulling away.
I don't want to lose touch
with the three of you.
Will you see what you can do?
She wants a life without complications.
Which you will give.
You decide on the house
in your own time,
but perhaps best not to bother
Olivia with it at the moment.
No complications, no secrets.
Give it a go.
Now you're asking too much.
You are your father's son.
[Horn honks]
Seriously, though,
until she's free to marry,
you will be discreet, won't you?
I respect her more than I can say.
Of course.
OLIVIA: Who's this? Who's this?
I was scared I'd missed you.
Livvy, I know that you care.
There'll be no Henry.
I more than care.
Don't give up on us.
But I wouldn't blame you if you did.
It's been tempting.
But I love you all too much.
Find what makes you happy.
Promise me.
He's already missing little Georgie.
Yes, he will.
Leah, I think the time might be here.
What for?
Your uncle.
Israel. What do you think?
[Ship horn blows]
Sir, your last appointment?
Send her in, and tea,
and then you can go.
Thank you, sir.
Mrs. Goddard, please come through.
Sir Richard.
You're a gutsy old broad, turning up.
"Broad" a bit much?
Not on the dung heap of <i>your</i> behavior.
You must have choked,
spitting out the truth.
We did what was right.
Doubt I would have been as generous
with the shoe on my foot.
Well, in a world where the best
take their cue from the worst,
what hope is there?
The worst, huh?
What do you expect of me now?
That we put an end to this today.
That any small gratitude you
feel might allow that to happen.
I doubt it.
It started with this knife.
A mother seeking individual justice.
Have you enough gratitude to
end it with an eye for an eye?
You do to me what I did to you.
I will bear the pain
if it allows you
to achieve balance in your mind.
If Regina can die for the
family, I can certainly do this.
Regina was barking.
Yeah, and I'm completely sane.
That is my offer.
Do it.
- You're serious.
- Oh, utterly.
Get out.
Is it over, then?
Take your knife.
So we continue
with the same vicious cycle?
No. That's it. Done. Finito.
Take your knife and go home.
Go and cut some apple with it.
An end to it all, then?
You're lucky you caught me
at a weak moment.
Perhaps Regina didn't die in vain.
Get out before I change my mind.
And stay out of my way, the lot of you.
You're grateful you're not
serving a life sentence.
You just can't say it.
And I suspect that hers is the
first death on your conscience.
It will haunt you
for the rest of your days.
[Door opens]
[Door closes]
[Sighs] The city one day,
back here the next.
It's tiring.
Welcome. You didn't have to rush back.
Oh, I wanted to share
the relief with you all.
Well, I'd still like to know
how you managed it.
As I said on the telephone,
it's enough that I did.
And you're definitely heading off?
- Yes.
- For how long?
That depends on James.
And what we make of Israel.
What Israel makes of you.
It'll be interesting.
I'll keep the menorah
burning in the window.
As you see, I've done my homework.
I'm impressed.
This won't come without challenges.
I don't doubt that for a moment.
"Her hands lay on her belly,
stroking the slight mound
that in other women might have
announced the start of new life.
She would never see that sign
in her body.
For her, the swelling
would only ever signal
fluid retention or gas,
body functions far removed
from the joyous cry of, "I'm expecting!"
This separated her into a group of women
harshly dubbed 'the barren'
and barred from normal expectation.
'Normal.'
Her enemy lay in that one word.
'Normal.'"
It's the answer to your question.
You asked what my behavior
with Henry says about me.
- I don't see...
- I cannibalized myself.
Writers have to.
You see, without experience,
there's no new meat,
none worthwhile.
And that's why I can't settle.
That's why I make odd choices...
to feed the beast.
So, what?
You'll keep complicating your
life just so you can write?
Perhaps not consciously.
Subconsciously, yes.
You can't let it rule your life.
Is marrying and settling down
any better?
This comes with risk,
but it comes with excitement.
- And I won't apologize for that.
- I haven't asked you to.
You've judged a lot of what I've done
for not fitting the mold,
including Henry.
And it's ironic,
because if I'm like anyone,
it's you when you were young.
That's exactly
why I'm worried about you.
I'll be all right.
And if I'm not, I'll...
I'll write a book about it,
so there's no downside.
You've got it all mapped out,
haven't you?
Not exactly.
And that's what's so exciting,
especially if I embrace it.
Because I have no idea what's ahead.
But that's wonderful.
Well, I don't expect any surprises.
We've got you well stabilized.
Goodo.
I'm gonna need another doc soon.
I'm off.
Where?
Sydney. They've talked me into it.
The the Aboriginal-Australian
Fellowship?
And her. Missus.
She doesn't take no for an answer.
Does she know?
Oh, I'll head out,
and I'll tell her after.
Well, she's away,
but, uh, she'll be happy.
Reckon so?
Well, I'll see you again
for the results.
I hope we keep in touch.
Yeah, I might check in
if I need any favors.
You were the clincher, you know?
You got me over the line.
If you could have the guts
to come back here
and face them all,
well, I can have the guts to
go out there and give it a go.
Well, glad I could help.
It's warmer out here than it is inside.
I just saw Frank Gibbs leave.
Seems like yesterday
I found him out here.
Not one of my finer moments.
No.
I've, uh, scheduled Mrs. Polk
next week for her hysterectomy.
Can we talk about it tomorrow?
Sorry, I've got a bit
on my plate at the moment.
We're past petty misunderstandings.
I hope so.
Thank you for seeing sense with Anna.
Carolyn told me.
It was tempting.
Other than work, my life's empty.
No urgings to move on?
I moved here for love.
I won't move for lack of it
without good cause.
I'll try not to give it.
Sort of got used to you.
And I you, in an odd sort of way.
[Clears throat]
Don't we have a hospital to run?
Yeah, let's drag it into the '60s, eh?
Open them.
I'd make it an engagement ring,
but I know they'd hit the roof.
A friendship one's enough. It's...
It's beautiful.
No, you are.
You're beautiful.
You're my girl.
I hope she understands
my negating her sacrifice.
I think the Regina
who made the sacrifice would.
After allowing Douglas his final choice,
I... I couldn't live with...
I understand.
Perhaps if I'd trusted sooner,
it may not have come to this.
How could any of us
have trusted her easily?
She reaped the crop she grew.
And died just before she might
have sown a better one.
Shall I walk you home?
You'll be its mistress soon.
It will always be yours as much as ours,
if that's what you want.
For a time, Douglas's death meant no.
But now, yes.
Ash Park.
