Good morning.
<font color="#804040">COUNSELOR:</font> I want her
to have something that
she won't be

I don't want to give
her a diamond so big,
she'd be afraid to wear it.
She is probably more
courageous than you imagine.
Is this a pillow?
No, it's an Asscher.
Look at the corners.
Let's put it in
the grading box.
The pillow has a slight
arc to the sides.
It is a modern version
of the old-mine cut.
Let's look at the color.
Put it table-side down.
So you're looking
through the pavilion?
Yes, there's more
to look through.
<font color="#808080">(CLOCK CHIMING)</font>
It appears to be yellow.
It's nitrogen that
gives it the yellow.
The colors start with D.
A D-stone has no color.
So, what am I looking at?
H.
Is that still a good color?
That's a very good color.
The truth is that
anything you can say
about the diamond is in
the nature of a flaw.
A perfect diamond would be
composed simply of light.
Do you see the inclusion?
No.
It is small, what we
would call a feather.
Yes.
I think I see it.
So, it is graded what?
A VS1.
Some might grade it higher.
You might grade it higher.
You like this stone?
Oh.
I like that stone.
How many carats is it?
3.9.
It's expensive.
Tell me what you see.
Remember, you're not
looking for merit.
This is a cynical business.
We seek only imperfection.
This is a 5-carat stone.
Tell me what you see.
The culet seems big.
Crown and pavilion don't fit.
The girdle comes out crooked.
Very good.
But there is no
perfect diamond.

We should talk stones.
The most valued stone
is the red diamond
from the Argyle
Mines, so very rare.
I've seen two in a long life.
A prize almost beyond belief.
I do want to hear.
<font color="#808080">(SIGHS)</font>
Well, I have to say,
there's no culture, save for
the Semitic culture, there.
The last known culture
before that was the Greek,
and there will be no
culture after, nothing.
That's a bold claim.
The heart of any culture is to be
found in the nature of the hero.
Who is that man who is revered?
In the classical world,
it is the warrior,
but in the Western world,
it is the man of God.
From Moses to Christ, the
Prophet, the Penitent.
Such a figure was unknown to the
Greeks, unheard of, unimaginable.
Because there is only a man
of God, not a man of gods.
And this God is the God
of the Jewish people.
There is no other God.
We see him...
What is the word?
Purloined.
Purloined in the West.
How do you steal a God?
The Jew beholds his
tormentor dressed
in the vestments of his
own ancient culture.
Everything bears a
strange familiarity.
The fit is always poor, and the
hands are always dripping blood.
That coat? Didn't that
belong to Uncle Haim?
What about the shoes?
Enough. I see your look.
No more philosophy.
The stones themselves have
their own view of things.
Perhaps they are not so
silent as you think.
They were piped up
out of the earth
in a time before
any witness was.
But here they are.
Let me show you.
This is a cautionary stone.
Although, I suppose every
diamond is cautionary.
A cautionary diamond.
Of course, why not?
It's not a small thing to wish
for, however unattainable...
to aspire to the stone's
endless destiny.
Isn't that the meaning
of adornment?
To enhance the beauty
of the beloved...
is to acknowledge
both her frailty,
and the nobility
of that frailty.
We announce to the darkness...
that we will not be diminished
by the brevity of our lives.
That we will not
thereby be made less.
You will see.

She's not. And your lady?

She's a woman.
I don't mean to

I just mean that, where men are
concerned, they've got their own agenda.
I always liked smart women. But it's
been an expensive hobby, you know?
Yeah.
Do you know what all
that stuff is? Uh...
Mostly, yeah.
Anything I don't know, I can ask
her. Which worries me even more.
Hmm.
You never told me what happened
with you and the

Those firm nipples in

Yeah, she was getting

Is that true?
I think so. Probably, yeah.

she took an extraordinary

She sucked on it so hard it
finally corrected my vision.
<font color="#808080">(LAUGHING)</font>
She left me for this

Whoo.
Had a boyfriend. Played for the
Oilers. Nice chap. Nice chap.
We met once for drinks
at this club in Dallas
to discuss our mutual plight.
He was taking it rather
poorly, I have to say.
Women do better, don't they?
Maybe they have more
practice at it.
Yeah, well, my guess
is that in most cases,
if you still have the woman
you're weeping over,
you'll be weeping harder.
Mm-hmm.
So, is this place secure?
Who knows?
I don't speak in arraignable
phrases anywhere.
There's a scrambler on
the phone, but still,
there's a lot of smart
people out there.
Of course, anybody who
thinks he's the smartest...
is on his way to the slam.
Would that be me?
No, no.
Although, I have to say
that I always thought
a law degree was a
license to steal...
and that you, for one, hadn't
really capitalized on it.
You're not the straight dude
people think though, are you?
I guess not.
I don't mean the caper, I
mean you. Women like you.
All right.
Do you know what
they like about you?
I'm a good fuck?
Right!
No, they can sniff out
the moral dilemma.
The paradox.
"Moral dilemma."
Yeah, they're drawn to it.
Not sure why.
Maybe it's just that lacking
any moral sense themselves...
they're fascinated
by it in men.
Men are attracted to flawed
women, too, of course...
but their illusion is
that they can fix them.
Women don't want
to fix anything.
They only want to
be entertained.
The truth about
women is you can
do anything to them
except bore them.
Well...
there's nothing about Laura
that I would want to fix.
Maybe not.
Do you think she knows
things about me
that I don't know about myself?
Jesus, Counselor, I'm not even sure
what sort of question that is.
Yeah.
Okay.
If you pursue this road that
you've embarked upon...
you will eventually
come to moral decisions
that will take you
completely by surprise.
You won't see it coming at all.
I don't intend to take
this up as a trade.
Yeah, one-time deal, right?
Which you've heard
a thousand times.
No, but a few.
What usually happens is that
after a couple of deals...
they know more than you do and they
set up shop across the street.
And how does that
work out for them?
Not well.
So, that would be
a moral issue.
Not for me.
Or for your associates.
Yeah, well...
They have a real aversion to
mixing business with pleasure.
Do you know what a bolito is?
No.
A bolo is one of those
skinny neckties...
or one of those things
you throw in Argentina.
Yeah, right.
No. In this case, it's
a mechanical device...
and it has this small
electric motor...
with this rather
incredible compound gear
that retrieves a steel cable.
Battery-driven.
And the cable is made out
of some unholy alloy
almost impossible to cut it.
And it's in a loop.
And you come up behind the guy
and you drop it over his head...
and you pull the free end of
the cable tight and walk away.
No one ever even sees you.
And pulling the cable
activates the motor
and the noose starts
to tighten...
and it continues to tighten
until it goes to zero.
It cuts the guy's head off.
Yeah, well, it can.
There's nothing he can do.
No.
Jesus.
Yeah.
How long does it take?
Oh...
Three, four minutes,
five maybe.
It depends on your collar size.
You're shitting me.
<font color="#808080">(CHUCKLES)</font>
No, no, no.
It's just that
there's no easy way
to turn the thing
off, or reason to.
It just keeps running until the
noose closes completely and then...
it self-destructs.
Actually, you're probably
dead in less than a minute.
From strangulation?
No.
The wire cuts through
the carotid arteries...
and then sprays blood all
over the spectators...
and everybody goes home.
Sweet.
Yeah, sweet.
Think about it, Counselor.
So where does all this
beheading shit come from?
You never used to see that.
I think it's blown in
here from the East.
Meaning the East?
Yeah.
You put nine Mexicans
and an Arab in a room,
and give them each $100, and
come back in a few hours,

be holding the grand?

Why do they kill them?
Who knows? Fun, snuff films. You'll

Anyway, what do you
do with a 15-year-old

some heinous manner?
Do you think the drug
lords hired kidnappers
to keep them supplied
with young girls?
I think they have kidnappers
on full retainer.
I should keep that
in mind, too.
I can't advise you, Counselor.
But you are advising me.
I just need you to be sure

Because I don't know...
Maybe I should tell you what Mickey
Rourke told what's-his-face.
That's my recommendation anyway,

"This arson is a serious crime."
Yeah. And so is this.

one person stands as
surety for another.
As surety. Yes.

It is.

is what happens when the surety
becomes the more attractive holding?

He was coming to see me.

What, he couldn't pay the fine?
He had $12,000 on him, but
they took that off him.
How did you find this out?
He called.
What else is he charged with?
I don't know.
Some other stuff.
And how fast was he going?
206.
206. Yeah.
What is that, "206"?
That's not a speed.
That's somebody's weight,
or a time of day.
You're telling me he was going
206 miles an hour? In what?
On that Jap bike of his.
Listen, if you could
get his money back...
he could pay the fine
and get out of there.
He's not getting
his money back.
How much is the fine?
$400.

I don't guess you
would spring for it.

No.
Yeah, his family
was from Brazil.
<font color="#808080">(CHUCKLING)</font> So this cousin
of Peterson shows up,
and we are all out here
on Saturday night.
And the cousin is
asking Peterson,
"How do you say, 'May
I have this dance?'."
Only we get wind of it.
And we shut Peterson up and we are
coaching him on how to say it.
Repeat after me, "I want
to eat your pussy." Right?
And we work with him till
he's pretty much got it down.
"I want to eat your pussy."
And we send him off.
He's this kind of
elegant-looking guy anyway.
So he goes off across the room,
and he picks out this really,
really great-looking girl.
And he stands in front of her, gives
her this little bow, and says,
"I want to eat your pussy."
And of course, the table
gets pretty quiet,
and the girl looks up at him
and says, "What did you say?"
And he says it again. A little
bow, "I want to eat your pussy."
And she stares at
him for a minute
and then looks over
to see past him,
and of course, hears these
three guys across the room
all hugging each other and just
weeping, weeping with merriment.
So she gets up, and she takes
Peterson's cousin by the hand,
and she takes him out to
this van in the parking lot
and proceeds to fuck
his brains out.
He's gone for an hour. We don't
know what the hell is going on.
And finally, she
leads him back in,
and gives him this
big, sexy kiss,
and she looks over at us to
make sure we're all watching,
and sends him back to the table.
Well, we're going nuts, nuts.
Peterson is trying to get
the story out of him,
and he's jabbering away,
and we're like, "What's he
saying? What's he saying?"
It's the whole thing. It's blowjob.
It's the works, the works.
Jesus, we're just
fucking flabbergasted.
And we are just sitting there
staring at each other.
And after a while,
Peterson gets up
and looks at us,
and off he goes.
He crosses the floor
to where this
cool-looking girl is
sitting by herself.
And he gives her a little bow
and announces that he
wants to eat her pussy.
Well, of course.
Well, this time, the husband is
coming out of the men's room.
And he's about, I don't
know, 11 feet tall.
This guy hit him so hard that
he came out of his loafers.
He came out of his loafers.
So Peterson is lying dead on the
dance floor in his sucked feet...
Anyway, they called
an ambulance,
and they hauled Peterson
off to the hospital,
and he's got a concussion
and a broken jaw.
Jesus. Yeah.
What did you guys do?
Nothing. We left.
We had enough fun

<i>and hands them to me and
gets out of the car.</i>
I asked her what
she was doing...
and she says, "I'm going
to fuck your car."
All right.
Leave the door open.
So...
<i>she goes around and climbs up
on the hood of the Ferrari...</i>
<i>and pulls her dress up
around her waist...</i>
and spreads herself
across the windshield
in front of me with
no panties on.
<i>And she's had this Brazilian
wax job, you know?</i>
<i>Don't even think I'm
making this up.</i>
<i>You can't make this
up, all right?</i>
<i>I mean, she was a dancer.</i>
<i>So, she does this
full split...</i>
and then she starts rubbing
herself up and down on the glass.
<i>Then she leans down to
see if I'm watching.</i>
<i>Like, no, I'm sitting
there reading my email.</i>
<i>And she kisses me upside down.</i>
<i>And then she tells me
that she's going to come.</i>
<i>I thought, "I'm losing my fucking
mind. That's what's happening here."</i>
<i>It was like one of those...</i>
one of those catfish things.
You know? One of those...

<i>Finally she climbs down
and she comes around...</i>
<i>and she gets in the car
and shuts the door.</i>
I hand her her knickers, she
puts them in her purse...
and she looks at me to see
what I thought about that.
<i>What I thought about it?</i>
Well, I don't know what
I thought about it.
I mean, I still don't.
It was too gynecological
to be sexy. Almost.
But mostly, I was
just fucking stunned.
<font color="#808080">(LAUGHING)</font>
And I asked her if she had
ever done that before...
and she said she had done everything
before. And I believe her.
So she starts the engine
and turns on the lights,
but the windshield
is so smeared,
and I didn't have
anything to wipe it with.
And she, of course, suggested
that I get out and lick it off.
But I tried the wipers,
and naturally, the windshield
washer thing doesn't work,
because Italians don't really
believe in that sort of thing.
And finally, I
took off my socks
and got out of the
car and used them.
Do you think she knew what kind
of effect this might
have on a guy?
Jesus, Counselor, are you
kidding? She knows everything.
You don't think this is
an odd thing to tell me?
I think it is an odd thing.
No, I mean, why is
it okay to tell
a thing like that
about somebody...
Somebody I'm banging?
Come on, Reiner.
Okay, I don't know,
you're probably right.
Maybe I wanted to see
what you would say.
Maybe there's more to it
than that. Maybe I'm scared.
You're scared?
Yeah.
Probably, yeah. Sometimes...
she scares the shit out of me.
Because of that? No, not that.
But...
You're in love with her.
I don't know what I am.
Yeah, I guess I'm in
love with her, but...
you don't think that's

to do with the deal?

Which, you must remember, was selected
because of her youth and beauty.
And all of this,
he has paid for.
So, what do you think that cost?
Ballpark?
Jesus.
Mmm.
God.
The point, Counselor...
is that you may think
there are things that
these people are
simply incapable of.
There are not.
Counselor, I don't know
what you should do.
But at this point, it's
out of your hands.
What about you?
I've known this day was
coming for a long time.
Do I regret what I've done?
That's sophomoric.
I should've jumped ship a
long time ago, and I didn't.
So, what happens next?
I'm going to go find
a nice, quiet place,
and sit down and
think about this.
I would suggest you do the
same, but I know you won't.
If you think,
Counselor, that you can
live in this world and
be no part of it...
then all I can say
is you're wrong.
It's not that you're
going down, Counselor...
it's what you're
taking down with you.
Excuse me, ma'am.
I'm terribly sorry
to bother you...
but my phone is out and
it's my kid's birthday.
May I please use your
phone for just a minute?
Sure.
Thank you.
Where are you?
I can't call you on

Now, listen to me. Go home and
wait for me there, I'll call you.

I'd tell them that I

you, Counselor.
Will you help me?
<i>I would urge you
to see the truth</i>
<i>of the situation
you're in, Counselor.</i>
That is my advice.
It is not for me to tell you what
you should have done or not done.
<i>The world in which you seek to
undo the mistakes that you made...</i>
<i>Is different from the world
where the mistakes were made.</i>
You are now at the crossing.
And you want to choose, but
there is no choosing there.
<i>There's only accepting.</i>
<i>The choosing was done
a long time ago.</i>
Are you there, Counselor?
Yes.
I don't mean to offend you...
but reflective men often
find themselves...
at a place removed from
the realities of life.
In any case, we should
all prepare a place...
where we can accommodate
all the tragedies
that sooner or later
will come to our lives.
But this is an economy few
people care to practice.
Do you know the
words of Machado?
<i>I know his name.</i>
<font color="#808080">(RECITING IN SPANISH)</font>
Lovely poet.
<i>Machado was a schoolteacher...</i>
<i>and he married a
young, beautiful girl.</i>
<i>And he loved her very much.</i>
<i>And she died.</i>
<i>And then he became
a great poet.</i>
I'm not going to
become a great poet.
<i>No, perhaps not. But even
if you were to do so...</i>
<i>it would not help you.</i>
Machado would have
traded every word,
every poem, every verse
he ever wrote...
for one more hour
with his beloved.
And that is because when
it comes to grief...
the normal rules of
exchange do not apply,
because grief transcends value.
<i>A man would give entire nations
to lift grief off his heart...</i>
and yet, you cannot buy
anything with grief.
Because grief is worthless.
Why are you telling me this?
<i>Because you continue to deny the
reality of the world you're in.</i>
<i>Do you love your wife so
much, so completely...</i>
that you would exchange places
with her upon the wheel?
And I don't mean dying,
because dying is easy.
Yes! Yes, damn you!
<i>Well, that is good
to hear, Counselor.</i>
What are you saying?
Are you saying this
is a possibility?
No.
It's impossible.
You said I was that man...
at that crossing.
<i>Yes. At the understanding...</i>
<i>that life is not going
to take you back.</i>
<i>You are the world you have created,
and when you cease to exist...</i>
<i>this world that you have created
will also cease to exist.</i>
But for those with the
understanding that
they're living the last
days of the world...
death acquires a
different meaning.
The extinction of
all reality...
is a concept no resignation
can encompass.
<i>And yet, in that despair,</i>
<i>which is transcendent,</i>
you will find the
ancient understanding
that the philosopher's stone
will always be found despised
and buried in the mud.
<i>This may seem a small thing
in the face of annihilation</i>
<i>until annihilation occurs.</i>
And then, all the grand designs
and all the grand plans...
will be finally exposed and
revealed for what they are.
<i>And now, Counselor,</i>
<i>I have to go, because I
have to make other calls.</i>
<i>If I have time, I think
I'll take a small nap.</i>
