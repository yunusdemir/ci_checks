<i>What's that?</i>
A friend of mine.
Uh, his Mom has died.
That's awful.
- Yeah.
You wanna get something to eat first?
No, we're there already.
Hey, when did you get here?
Oh, just this morning.
I'm really sorry about your Mom.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Buck, this is Carlyn, my fiancée.
I'm so sorry.
I'm glad you could make it, you know?
I think about you all the time,
us as kids and stuff.
You don't look much different.
You do.
Your face is fatter.
Hello, how are you?
I thought that she was dead...
- Boo!
Hey. - Hey, are you guys bored?
What are you doing?
You wanna go see my room?
It's my Mom.
She's pretty.
She would've hated this,
all this people in her house.
It's kind of strange to see you
after all this years, I mean...
under these circumstances.
Guess who this is.
It's me and Chuck.
Chuck?
I go by Charlie now, pretty much.
Chuck and Buck.
That's so adorable. Look at you
guys, you're such a little cuties.
I have a whole box of pictures.
You guys should spend a night?
We gotta get back, um...
We got a flight at 8:00 o'clock.
<i>Back to L.A.?</i>
You live there too?
Yeah, we live together.
You should come visit L.A.
<i>» I got freedom of the heart,
it's a brand new start... «</i>

<i>» Yeah... «</i>
Uh, hey! Uh...
Hi.
So, I was thinking that, uh...
you should stay...
<i>and go back tomorrow.</i>
Oh, I wish we could, um...
It's just work and everything...
But y-you should visit in L.A.
You should...
What? Hey, what are you
doing, man? No, no!
We're going.
- OK.
Don't you wanna say goodbye?
- Yeah, I did.
<i>Hey, this is a message for Chuck.</i>
Hey Chuck, it's Buck.
How's it goin'?
Um...
I, uh... was thinking about what
you said about coming to Los Angeles...
and, uh...
I thought I might do that. So...
Uh...
You know...
Oh, my number is 805...
5554322, in case
you don't have it.
And, um... So, you know...
Call me and, uh...
let me know, you know...
whatever, OK?
All right? Okay, bye.
<i>9,400, 9,500...</i>
9,600, 9,700, 9,800,
9,900... That's 10,000$.
Thank you.
Hey, Pilar.
- Hi.
<i>Hey buddy, it's Charlie calling back. Uh...
Listen, you know, we'd love you to come and visit...</i>
<i>Um... Carlyn's folks are
in town this week and...</i>
<i>and the following week
I'm going to New York on business.</i>
<i>So, the next month or two
is gonna be pretty bad...</i>
<i>The next month or two
is gonna be pretty bad...</i>
<i>But, what I'll do is: I'll call you
after I get back from my trip...</i>
<i>and we can work something out.</i>
<i>So, it was good to see you after so long.
And-and I hope you're doing OK.</i>
<i>And I'll call you. Later.</i>

Hi.
Hi. That's a really nice shirt.
My Mom bought it for me.
Well, can I help you with something?
I'm here to see Chuck Sitter, Charles.
He's up on the sixth floor.
Oh, if you just hold on
for one second, I'll call him.
<i>Hi, it's Diane.</i>
There's a, um...
What's your name?
What?
- What's your name?
No...
No...
Huh...
I'm delivering some artwork,
Sitter, sixth floor.
All right.
<i>Hey, wo! Hold up!</i>
Wait up!
Hold it, hold the door.
Hi.
- Hi. Can I help you?
Um... Do you put on plays here,
and people come and see 'em?
Well, this is a theatre.
Well, say I thought of a play,
w-would you put that on?
You've written a play?
- I've never...
Oh. Just creating
a hipothetical scenario?
What if, um...
What if I didn't
want you to read it?
Well, you could write at the top of
the page: "Don't let Beverly read it".
I'll beg and plead, but
they won't let me read it.
Oh, no... What I... What I meant
was, um... - I know what you meant.
You could rent out the theatre.
On Monday evenings
they make it available for just...
you know, secret plays.
OK, thanks.
So, why are you always
standing in front of the theatre?
Oh, um...
I'm waiting for my friend.
Hey.
Buck, what the hell...
What are you doing in L.A.?
I've moved here.
You live here?
Since when?
Oh, not that long,
just a few weeks.
Wow. What are you doing?
- Well, I was over at a...
Gorgio's? The food's great,
if you like fish.
I mean, what are you doing in L.A.?
- I'm putting on a play.
You are?
Yeah, I was thinking about
those plays we used to put on.
I was thinking about, you know,
"The Devil and the Raindeer".
"The Devil and the Raindeer"?
Uh-huh. - It was a...
- They both have horns...
so they team up
against Santa.
How was New York?
Oh, it got cancelled.
Um... I didn't go.
Oh...
I see.
You know, we're having
some people over tomorrow night.
It's a little party
for Charlie's promotion.
Yeah, I should've remembered that.
Um... Yeah, you should come. It'll be great.
Uh... I'll give you directions.
Do you have a pen? - Yeah.
Well, I can find it.
What time?
People are coming
around 10:00, 10:30.
It starts at 8:00.
- Whenever.
That'll be great.
- OK.
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.
Great... bye.
- See you tomorrow.
Bye.
Bye.
- Bye.
Hey, Buck!
- Oh, hi.
You made it. - Yeah.
- You look nice.
Can I get you something?
Something to drink or to eat...?
Rum and Coke.
- OK.
Rum and Coke for him,
and I'll take the Chardonney.
So, you made it.
Did you have any trouble
finding the house?
Where is Charlie? - I don't know,
I think he's probably out back or something.
I love those West Indian basket woman
things you have in the living room.
Thank you! God, I was afraid people
are gonna think they were racist.
My decorater pushed me into it.
Jolie, this is Buck,
friend of Charlie's from home.
How do you do?
- Oh, hi.
Well, guys, I'm gonna go make the round.
- By all means, go play hostes.
And you're friends with Charlie?
Yeah, best friends.
Well, when we were kids.
What are you doing in L.A, Buck?
Oh, nothing. - I know a lot
of people who have that job.
It's one of the better jobs you can have.
I bet you're very good at it.
I kind of wanna talk to Charlie right now.
OK, I think he's out back.
But thanks for talking to me.
- Oh, no. It's nice meeting you.
Hey, Chuck!
- Hey, man.
You want a drink?
- Oh... no, I have one.
OK, see you in a second.
Oh!
- Oh, hey... sorry.
I was just looking around.
It's okay, I'm just gonna
touch up my make-up.
Are you having any fun?
Yeah... I noticed there was
no pictures of me anywhere.
Oh, yeah.
Charlie doesn't have any pictures.
He's not a very sentimental guy.
<i>What was he like
when you knew him?</i>
Oh, he was fun.
<i>Yeah, we had fun.</i>
I think Charlie wants to hang out
with his other friends tonight.
Well, there are a lot of people here
from his work and everything.
He really cares a lot about his work.
But I know he's glad you're here.
...they were incredible.
I think they're gonna be huge!
Yeah, that's probably true.
Hoody, where's your
music supervisor from Fresno?
Hey, Chuck.
- Hey, Buck.
Buck, this is Josh Weintraub.
- Hi.
Tony Maxwell.
- How you're doing?
Vince Duffy.
- How's it?
And Melissa...
- Booth.
Buck's a friend of mine from up North.
So, how's it going?
- I like your house.
Do you... um...
It's very...
Who, um...?
Let it out, Buck.
- It's a very old-persony.
Yeah, last time Buck and I saw each other...
we were camping out in his parent's backyard,
eating potato chips, playing spy games...
Good old days.
- Exactly.
He went by Chuck, and I was Buck,
so we were Chuck and Buck.
All the other kids wanted to play with us...
but, you know, we wouldn't let them.
Well, Charlie hasn't changed,
he's still a very exclusive guy.
We'd get in such royal trouble too.
Once my parents grounded me
for a week because we took our...
Listen guys, I'm gonna go get a drink.
Charlie, I'd love to, um...
- Yeah, I know. I'm just gonna get a drink.
Hello?
<i>Hello, is... is Charlie there?</i>
Is this Buck?
<i>Yeah, hi.</i>
Hold on.
Talk to him.
I don't want to.
Buck, um...
Charlie's not around.
<i>But, uh...
I'll let him know that you called.</i>
OK.
<i>OK, bye.</i>
OK, Mr Wise Tree. All right, don't forget
you know all and you don't say anything.
Just move a little bit...
There you go. Perfect.
<i>Now, we're gonna take it
from where the Scarecrow...</i>
<i>is having a very hard time waking up.</i>
Now, all of you face the audience...
Share, share that face with the audience.
Don't forget you men are straws,
so bluh, bluh...
We need Dorothy - this is you,
sweetheart - try to wake him up!
OK, so wake up, Strawman.
Wake up, Strawman!
<i>Wake up, Strawman!</i>
Well, if it isn't the man who's
waiting for his friend? - Hey!
You remember me?
Oh, well, um... I wrote a...
I wrote a play. - Over a day?
Yeah, and I was kind of hoping
you could help me.
What? Direct-produce?
<i>Yeah.</i>
Well, I'm the house manager,
I don't know shit about directing.
That's OK.
No, it wouldn't work. You'll
have to pay me by the hour.
<i>How much?</i>
25$ an hour.
OK.
What's all this stuff?
This is... this is it.
- This is it?
Yeah.
"Hank and Frank".
<i>Is this a children's play?</i>
Well, it has kids in it.
Um... In... in the first part
they're kids, and in the...
second part they're... they're older.
- Uh-huh, time laps, huh? I gotcha.
<i>So when can you read it?</i>
<i>I don't think this is a children's play.</i>
It's way out there.
I think you have
something weird about women...
I think you have
something weird about men.
How old are you?
27.
Your face is, uh...
i-i-it's twiching.
Oh, yeah, it... Sometimes it, uh...
I have, uh...
When I'm nervous.
So, how many nights do you want
to book the theatre?
One.
One?
You're just gonna do it
for one night only?
Well, all right.
Uh... I can reserve
the first Monday in December.
That'll give us
four weeks for rehearsal.
Now, about the 25$ an hour:
are you bullshiting me?
No.
OK. Well, I'm gonna ask you
to pay me every week.
And I'll keep a record of my hours.
Hi Jamila, it's Diane.
There's Buck O'Brien here to see Charlie.
<i>He says he doesn't
have an appointment.</i>
He's in a meeting, but you can
wait here and then he'll see you.
Hi, Diane.
- Hi.
Hi, I'm Jamila,
I'm Charlie's assistant.
He's still in a meeting, but you
can come up and wait if you want.
Oh, OK.
<i>Get that cover letter to Ed Stegner.</i>
Recipy was in the office, did they sent
those tapes with the samples on 'em?
Oh, they did, I have it.
Jesus, Jamila, I've been asking you
for those tapes for two days.
Well, it just came.
Hey, Buck! You had a good time
at the party the other night?
Sure... at first.
I don't know about parties.
They're all asking me what I do.
How's the play?
The play?
Well, it's not really...
But I... What I want...
I want to spend time, uh... hanging out...
<i>with you, and catching up.</i>
Yeah. I mean, me too.
That'll be great.
Yeah, because we really haven't seen each
other and I feel bad that we didn't keep up.
You know, I...
I feel it's my fault.
It's not your fault. I mean, I moved.
You know, these things happen.
So... what have you been doing?
- Well...
My Mom was sick for, like, five years.
So I was kind of taking care of her.
Yeah, it must've been tuff.
Hey, that's my band.
I signed those guys.
<i>» I'll leave the frown I'm locked
'cause I can't hear the... «</i>
You know, I kind of meaned to, uh...
write you or... or call you.
Yeah, 'cause I thought about you
all the time, you know.
After you left, I didn't really get into
school at all, you know.
I didn't like the other kids so much.
All the homework and sports
just weren't that fun.
It's weird you have this office.
What are you doing here?
Sign bands and produce and...
negotiate contracts.
<i>I mean, it's not... not that interesting.</i>
That's funny, that's really funny.
'Cause, you remember we used to
play games like we were businessmen.
Remember we bought
all those office supplies?
And now you're, like, really doing it.
Is it real now or is it
still like a game?
It's pretty real.
Remember all those games
we used to play?
<i>Charlie, Marion Cash.</i>
I'll return... No, I'll take it.
Uh, Buck, I gotta get back to work.
Oh... OK.
- But I'm glad you came by.
So, we should get
some lunch sometime, OK?
<i>I'll just give Jamila your number
and we'll get together.</i>
Oh, all right.
Well, um... Bye Chuck, I'm, you know...
glad that we're... - Yeah, me too.
Oh, I almost forgot...
I wanna get a picture of us.
Um...
Right now?
Well, I was kind of hoping, yeah.
OK... Jamila!
Yes? - Can you
help us out here... please?
Here.
Are you guys ready?
- Take the picture.
One...
two, three.
Here you go.
- Thanks.
I'll get it.
You're leaving?
- No.
Hey... Buck.
Hey.
- Ever thought of using a phone?
Oh, I was just gonna drop something by.
I can come back later.
Hey, Buck.
- Hi.
Can I get you something to drink?
Oh, no, that's all right.
Would you like some coffee, a bagle?
Would you like some ice-cream?
Really?
Oh... mm...
I like ice-cream.
OK. Do you want some, Charlie?
- No.
What you got there?
Oh, this?
I made this for Chuck.
<i>Wow!</i>
Yeah, I saw that you
didn't have any pictures of us.
So I...
I made this for you.
That's really creative.
This is a picture we took today.
Today?
Oh, yeah, Buck... um...
visited me in the office.
I made one of my Mom...
and then one of me and my Dad
and then this one.
It took a long time.
I bet.
OK, let me, um...
get you that ice-cream.
So, do you remember all these pictures?
Kind of.
I had copies of 'em made,
so you know, I could cut them up.
So, do you like it?
Yeah...
Yeah, it's great.
I love strawberry.
Well, I'm... I'm gonna go up to bed.
Already?
- Yeah, I'm exhausted.
Yeah, so am I.
It was nice to see you again, Buck.
- Right, thanks for the ice-cream.
I'll be right up.
- OK.
See ya.
So, what should we do?
Oh, I gotta wake up early tomorrow.
I think we should play a game.
What do you mean? Like,
trivial pursue or something?
Yeah...
Or... like... you know.
<i>What?</i>
Like some other kind of game.
Like what?
Can she hear us?
Carlyn?
What are you talking about?
Like one of those games...
where you stick your dick in my mouth...
and I stick mine in yours.
Chuck and Buck... Suck and fuck.
<i>I think you should get out of here, Buck.</i>
I mean it, get out. Now!
So, this is the "Frank" pile...
and this is the "Hank" pile.
And this is "The Witch" pile.
OK.
I think I have your little Hank and Frank.
I don't know if they're gonna be able to
memorize all those lines...
<i>but let me get them for you.</i>
Jake, Tommy!
Can you come up here, kids?
Hey, guys.
This is Buck, say hello.
Hello.
- Hi.
OK guys, thanks.
Um, well... I think that the one
with the dark hair is okay for Hank.
<i>But the other one's
not really right for Frank.</i>
Buck, he's a good little actor.
He was the Cheshire Cat in the
"Alice in Wonderland" show that he did.
And he was hilarious.
<i>He may not be what you're looking for,
but I don't think we're gonna get any better.</i>
All right, guys,
fill out the signing sheet.
Name, telephone number,
any acting experience you might have.
And, uh...
I'll need you headshots, please.
What if... What if I got no agent?
Well, just fill in your telephone number.
What if your phone is out of order?
"I know who you are".
"You fooled Hank, but
you haven't fooled me".
"Don't you see, Hank? Are you
too blind to see what's in front of you?"
"I know who you are and you foolen ham,
but you haven't foolen me".
<i>"You put that course on me".</i>
"Don't you remember anything?"
"She's evil, Hank! Evil!"
Now, in this scene, you were playing...
Hank's girlfriend, Delilah.
She's sweet, loving,
fun whenever Hank's around.
But Frank sees you right through you.
OK.
"I don't know
what you're talking about, Frank".
"You were Hank's friend and
I felt sorry for you".
"But I won't stand for this
and Hank won't either".
"So, unless you want
to go back to that hellhole,
I suggest you clean up your act".
Very nice, thank you.
My name is Adam,
I'm reading for Hank.
I see.
"I'm your friend
and I would do anything for you".
"But I know my wife
and she wouldn't hurt a fly".
"I'm going out,
but when I get back,
"I hope you'll make things right".
<i>"I'm telling you the truth, she's a witch!"</i>
"Frank,
<i>"do it for me".</i>
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Hi, how you're doin'?
Sam, is it?
- Yeah.
Where... where are you from?
- All over... New Jersey.
You've been acting long?
- Nah, some commercials.
<i>"Mountain Deux", some others.</i>
<i>Well, OK.
Go ahead.</i>
"Frank, you're my friend
and I would do anything for you".
"But I know my wife
and she couldn't hurt a fly".
"And now you've really hurt her".
OK... Now, Hank is really upset.
He's had it up to here.
<i>You think you could try it a little bit more...?</i>
<i>Like, really mad?
- Exactly.</i>
"Frank, you're my friend
and I would do anything for you".
"But I know my wife
and she couldn't hurt a fly".
"And now you've really hurt her".
"I can't stand to see you like this".
"I'm going out now, but when I get back...
"I hope you'll make things right".
<i>"I'm telling you the truth, she's a witch".</i>
"Frank, do it for me!"
<i>Great, thanks, you're coming in.</i>
Yeah, that felt better.
Here.
Oh, hey.
Wow!
Thanks.
Well, now we have left to do is
to decide on Hank.
And I think it's pretty obvious
who we should go with.
No, I like this guy.
You're kidding, right?
Like, he was the worst thing
we saw today. He can't act.
I thought he was all right.
Buck... No!
He can't act at all!
No!
I mean, no.
He is a moron.
I think - him.
Oh, my God!
Oh, shit...
<i>Hello, is Charlie there?</i>
Hi, Buck.
<i>Hi.</i>
I'm sorry, he's not in.
I'll have him call you, OK?
<i>Did you tell him it was important?</i>
Yep, I've told him, but
he's really busy. OK? Goodbye.
I wish he could just, like,
do his job. - Exactly.
Jamila?
Can I talk to you?
Just for a second.
OK, yeah,
I'll see you guys there.
He's there, isn't he?
He could call me back,
he just doesn't want to.
Maybe...
I mean... I don't...
I don't really know.
What's the matter?
- No, no.
Just don't, forget it.
<i>Just...</i>
Whatever.
Hello?
Buck?
<i>Hi.</i>
You really freaked out
my assistant today.
I did?
Look, I'm sorry your mother died
and I know that we were really good friends...
<i>once.</i>
We were best friends.
Right, but that was a long time ago.
My life is really complicated right now,
you know. I got a ton of work...
<i>and I'm getting married.</i>
It's because of her, huh?
<i>Carlyn?</i>
She doesn't like me.
<i>She does like you, OK?
It's not her.</i>
A lot has changed.
I can't deal with it, I'm not
the same person anymore.
What do you mean?
<i>I don't know why you've...
fixated on me.</i>
<i>Yes, you do.</i>
Look, don't call.
Don't call me at home,
don't call me at the office,
don't stop by unannounced.
Just stay away.
<i>"He's not gonna wake up, Frank".</i>
<i>"It's only bad luck if it drops in the mud".</i>
"Says who?"
- "Says everybody".
"Take the shovel and start digging".
<i>"Find the place where the ground is soft".</i>
Hey.
- Hey.
So, you wrote this?
Yeah.
- How long did it take?
A few days.
- A few days, huh?
That's all?
It's pretty good.
Thanks.
- Hey, don't thank me.
Thank you.
You wrote a fantastic play.
I'll see you later.
- Yeah, all right.
Take care.
Pick a color.
- Green.
G, R, E, E, N.
Pick a number.
- Seven.
You already picked seven.
Eleven.
"You will live with the
movie stars in Beverly Hills"
Yep, that's me.
- Have you ever played this game?
Yeah.
Listen, about the script...
I see it as a love story
between Hank and Frank.
You do?
- Yeah, don't you?
It's like a homo-erotic
misoginistic love story.
Well, it is what it is.
I don't know.
I mean, I wanted to write something like...
like... like the kind of things
me and my friend used to do.
Let me do a beat-by-beat
analysis of the play, OK?
OK.
"Hank and Frank" are this
"Waiting for Godot" little duo.
They're in the forest,
it's like paradise.
Right. - This horrible
wicked witch woman appears...
They traspassed.
She casts a spell on both of them.
And makes Hank stupid.
And she turns Frank into a cripple.
Which is like castration.
She castrates him.
What do you mean?
- Like, she...
takes his penis away.
What TV shows do you watch?
What TV shows do I watch?
It's like a fairytale, you know,
it's like "Goldielocks"...
or, uh... "Little Red Ridinghood".
You know, there's some kids,
and a witch and a curse and...
<i>Hello?</i>
Hello?
Who was it?
- You know who it is.
It's Buck. He calls every
15 minutes and hangs up on me.
What's the deal?
Uh... he's crazy.
Was he always like this or...?
Yeah, and his parents were nuts.
I feel sorry for him,
his Mom just died...
But don't worry,
he'll stop calling eventually.
<i>You're starting to feel the poison.</i>
You get on your knees
and you stumble across towards Frank.
Now, Delilah, you stand between them.
I don't think she should be
standing there. - Why not?
Unless you want me to hit her.
She's fucking killed me.
I'm not gonna just pass by:
"Oh, hey! Hi, how you're doin'?"
But you're weak with the poison.
I'm not that weak.
What if she stands over there?
Uh-uh, I could still easily
pop her with my hand.
<i>"I know my wife
and she couldn't hurt a fly".</i>
I think we're fuckin' doomed, man.
I know I'm not inviting my agent.
You're not?
- No! Fuck, no.
Can you keep it simple?
See, what I don't understand
is less anger.
I mean, I don't think I'm angry enough.
<i>What I mean is, you can
show anger without screaming.</i>
Just pull it down a bit.
You know that, when you're angry...
you raise your voice.
You know that?
Try it...
without screaming.
"I know my wife
and she couldn't hurt a fly".
"Now you've really hurt her".
Sadie! Sadie!
She won't come.
You want a blow-pop?
Mom!
Mom!
Can I have a blow-pop?
- No, your lunch is almost ready.
Come on, please!
- No!
Here, you can have a lick of mine.
Mom says they'll rot my teeth out.
I eat them all the time and look.
This is top secret stuff, OK?
- OK.
Nobody knows about this.
Look, black catch.
I tried to stick one on Sadie's butt.
Sadie hates me.
Let's light one off.
OK.
Oh! Oh!
Oh, my God! Mommy!
Mommy, help!
Oh, shit!
What?
Help!
- Oh, my God! Tommy!
What happened?
He had some firecrackers.
Keep working, guys, OK?
I need to talk to you.
What happened yesterday?
When?
With Tommy, yesterday.
Well, he set off a firecracker
and he burnt his hand.
Yes, and his mother is freaking out.
She's pulling him out of the play.
She is? - She's pulling him
out of both plays.
And Barry is totally pissed off at me.
Hell, why didn't you stop him?
I don't know.
- Buck, when you're around kids,
you need to protect them!
Remember, you're an adult.
I know it doesn't give you much time.
But our backs are against the wall.
So what do you think?
It's fine with me.
Now, uh... Would we be
playing it like little kids, like a...
like... like...
"La-la-la, I'm a little kid?"
Well, you wouldn't be playing it
like a little retarded kid.
But yes, you would be acting youthfull.
Fine, all right.
I'll do it.
Charlie Sitter's office.
<i>Hello? This is, uh... Bob...</i>
<i>Double... berg.</i>
<i>Charlie, Bob Doubleberg.</i>
Who?
<i>He says he's returning your call.</i>
Take a number.
Hello?
Hello.
<i>Hey Chuck, it's Buck.</i>
I didn't think you would
return my call, so...
<i>What do you want, Buck?</i>
Well, the play that I wrote...
They're putting it on
a week from Monday and...
<i>I was hoping you could come.</i>
I don't know, Buck, I don't...
I think you might wanna see it.
You know, it's a...
It would mean a lot to me.
<i>It's at the "Aeternus" theatre.</i>
<i>It's right across the street from your office.</i>
<i>You know?
It's not that great of play,</i>
<i>but I think you might like it.</i>
<i>Buck, I gotta go off the phone,
I got another call.</i>
<i>Thanks for letting me know, OK?
I'll see what I can do.</i>
Chuck, please come, OK?
"You gotta understand, Delilah..."
Line.
"Things have been hard for Frank".
"Things have been hard for Frank".
What is it?
"He's been wandering the forest for years".
"He's been wandering the forest for years".
Nah.
Can I hold my script?
If that's what you need.
<i>I feel like I'm in 7th grade.</i>
<i>I'm crammin' for this test
and I'm gonna fail.</i>
Sweet.
Look at this shit.
It's like a fuckin' Romper room here.
Yeah.
- It's all kids stuff.
Look at this shit.
Is that your Mom and Pops?
Yeah.
- Where are they?
Oh, they're dead.
Oh, whoops!
That's too bad...
Why do you live in a motel?
Where should I live?
- I don't know. You know,
apartment, condo.
Hey, you want one?
Here you go.
There's something funny about you.
You're funny, huh?
- Maybe.
People used to say I'm funny.
I mean...
They say: "Sam, you're funny,
you should be an actor".
I didn't want to be an actor 'n' nuthin',
but, you know, people kept saying that.
And I was like: "Well,
"it beats land-fucking-carpet".
<i>OK, I gotta try that part again. OK?</i>
<i>"There won't be dark for hours".</i>
<i>"Yeah, Frank,
the cookie sounds good to me".</i>
"I don't know Hank, I don't trust her".
What's the line?
- "Come on, don't be a chicken".
"Come on, don't be a chicken".
- "I'm not a chicken..."
All right, all right, that's enough,
my head's spinning.
I don't know...
I don't know about that chick.
Who, Beverly?
- Yeah, Beverly.
I think she's got problems.
I mean, I think she wished she had a cock.
You know what I'm sayin'?
Well, she's all right.
- Yeah, she's all right.
I hate her fuckin'... I don't know...
I wonder what her twat looks like.
You ever wonder that? It's like,
sometime she'll be talkin' to me,
<i>and all I can think is,
what's her twat look like.</i>
<i>"Why don't you show it to me,
you fuckin' bitch?"</i>
Yeah... I'm twisted.
I got problems, I know I do.
You look like this friend of mine.
- Yeah?
That's cool.
- My best friend.
I'm nervous.
Nervous? About what?
I don't think my friend
is gonna come to the play.
Why not? - I don't think he
wants to be my friend anymore.
Why not?
I don't know.
Because...
I'm not normal.
Hey, Buck, you're normal.
But I know if he saw the play,
he'd remember
the way things used to be...
with us and all the things we did.
I think he'd changed his
mind about me, you know.
Hey, the least this guy can do
is get off his ass and come see it.
I mean, come on,
you just gotta make him come.
Take care.
- You too.
I'll see you soon.
- Tomorrow, right?
Yeah.
Hey.
- Oh, my God! Buck!
I'm sorry.
- You scared me.
Sorry, I... I was gonna
call you, but, you know...
your phone's been disconnected.
Yeah, well... Someone kept
calling us and hanging up.
Yeah... Well, um...
I wanted to tell you about my play.
See, I have this play and, um...
they're doing a performance of it.
You do? - Yeah, Monday...
Monday night at 8:00.
And I... I told Chuck about it...
but I'm just... I'm not sure if he, um...
he's gonna...
Where is it? - Uh, it's...
It's at the "Aeternus" theatre.
Well, we'll try to be there.
It sounds... illuminating.
Are you ready?
Um, you know... Could we just
blow it off? I'm kind of tired.
You wanna blow it off?
Well, I'm going.
- You don't have to be nice.
<i>I wanna see it, I'm curious.</i>
Are you coming or not?
Hey, Tommy, how's your hand?
- Fine.
Can I have these two seats
for my sister?
No.
- I need them.
I don't care, they're saved.
Hey, hey.
- Hey, Buck.
Hey.
- They almost took your seats.
Come on.
- All right.
So, uh...
here are your seats.
Hey.
OK. Well, I'll see you
after the show. - OK.
Get up, Buddy.
Come on.
Wake up, Buddy.
- He's not gonna wake up, Frank.
Come on, Buddy.
He's dead, Frank!
<i>You've been sitting there for hours.</i>
<i>He's not gonna wake up.</i>
You don't even care.
Buddy is dead!
Ah, it's not such a big deal.
Easy for you to say,
it's not your dog.
<i>Forget about the dog, Frank.</i>
<i>I wanna go into the forest and play.</i>
<i>I love playing with you.</i>
<i>And today I'm gonna show you
a new game.</i>
Mmm, cookies...
Yumm...
Yeah, Frank,
a cookie sounds good to me.
I don't know, Hank,
I don't trust her.
<i>I know what you two
have been doing in the forest!</i>
<i>And you've been very bad!</i>
<i>Now eat these cookies!</i>
<i>You keep talking and talking...</i>
<i>and talking about that night.</i>
<i>But I don't remember.</i>
It's because she put a curse on you.
She put a curse on both of us,
she made me the cripple that I am today.
<i>Delilah is a witch.</i>
<i>My wife, Delilah?</i>
You can both go to doggy heaven,
for all I care.
<i>I'm sorry, Frank,
I should've believed you.</i>
<i>And now it's too late.
We came into this mud together,</i>
now we're gonna die together.
You were right all along.
<i>I shouldn't have made you
eat those cookies.</i>
<i>You were younger than me.
I shouldn't have done that to you.</i>
<i>But it's because I love you.</i>
<i>I'm sorry, Frank.</i>
<i>I love you.</i>
I'm sorry man, I fucked up.
I thought I was gonna shit my pants
out there, I really did.
That's okay, thanks.
Hey.
Charlie, tell Buck
what you thought of his play.
Charlie?
We're having a cast party,
you guys should stay.
Are you sure
you can't stay for a minute?
Hey, we did it!
<i>I need to know what's going on.
- There's nothing going on.</i>
There's something going on!
- You were the one who's felt sorry for.
I told you he's fucking crazy.
Barry liked the play.
And he's asked me to direct
"Chitty Chitty, Bang, Bang"...
in February. Isn't it great?
We're taking off now.
Hey... Congratulations!
See ya.
- Good work, Sam.
You made it out alive.
Good night, guys.
My friend came.
He didn't liked it.
- I'm sure he liked it.
Oh, what does he know?
<i>You like this place?
- Yeah.</i>
You know, you should
move in across the hall.
It's my fuckin' bitch neighbour,
she just moved out.
This chick is from hell, man.
I couldn't play my music,
I couldn't party in the hall...
One day she couldn't take it anymore...
She just starts cryin',
called me an asshole...
and she moved out.
<i>» I'm so lonesome I could die... «</i>
Don't mess with Sam.
<i>» Well, I don't see you
and it's getting dark... «</i>
<i>» Today we should have gone
to Central Park... «</i>
<i>» Well, don't you wanna
see me ever again? «</i>
<i>» If not, I'll meet you
on the astral plane... «</i>
<i>» Astral plane for late at night,
the astral plane or I'd go insane! «</i>
<i>» Well, we've known each other
from other lives, «</i>
<i>» I want to see you today, but I'll
prove my knowledge of what's inside... «</i>
<i>» When I intercept you
on the astral plane... «</i>
<i>» The astral plane for late at night,
the astral plane or I'll go insane... «</i>
What the fuck!
Oh, man!
What was that?
- I... I was just...
What was that, Buck?
I was gonna sleep over.
Get out of here!
I didn't asked you to grab my cock!
<i>Get the fuck out of here!</i>
Oh, fuck!
<i>» And when we're together,
and I got my friends by my side... «</i>
<i>» When we're together,
there's nothing in the world that I'd lie... «</i>
When we were kids,
we did these things.
<i>What things?</i>
Sex things.
I know all about that.
Kids are kids.
They experiment, it's...
It's completely normal.
What happened, wasn't normal.
You know, Buck,
I'm worried about you.
You've lost your mother.
That's hard.
He started it.
He made me this way.
<i>It was a long time ago.</i>
So?
- So... you need to let go.
You have to create something new.
<i>You don't have to act like I'm crazy.</i>
But the truth is...
I was here...
way before you.
And I know what you are.
You're like his house...
or his car.
That's all.
Chuck and me...
<i>He's all I have.</i>
You don't have him.
<i>Buck, I'm gonna give you
the number of my therapist.</i>
<i>She can recommend someone for you.</i>
<i>I want you to get help.</i>
<i>"Nine Iron Fills Seats"...</i>
it's just the other thing
we're a little worried about.
For "Freudian".
- "Freudian"?
"Freudian" is a great band...
- We can get "Nine Iron" for, let's say...
the L.A. shows...
We would be happy
to work something with "Freudian".
How many shows is there?
- It's two shows.
I got two shows...
It's in town,
it's gonna be really good for us.
And then, maybe... If we give you, like a...
San Francisco... - We're leaving really far in this.
Um... Can you, guys, hold on a minute?
- Sure. - I'll be back in a minute.
You followed me here, didn't you?
I have some things to say to you.
- I don't give a shit!
I've got some promoters here.
I don't have time for you, not now, not ever!
Well, if you want me to leave you alone
then you listen for me for a few minutes.
I have some things to say.
What the fuck was that yesterday?
Was it some kind of joke?
<i>Jesus, Buck, you need help.</i>
You want to order something?
- No!
I have people here. I told you that.
Didn't you hear me?
After I'm finished with them,
I'll have one drink with you.
You can tell me whatever the fuck
it is you have to say.
<i>Jesus, Buck!</i>
Not bad, Charles.
- All right, man.
Good to see you.
I met a friend,
he's over here tonight.
What can I get you?
- Uh... You got Martini?
Rum and Coke.
- OK.
So, talk.
I...
I know that things have changed.
I know that...
things can't be the way they were.
The way they were?
We were eleven years old!
You act like it's weird that I've changed.
<i>Like it's some freak occurance that
I wanna climb trees with you all day.</i>
People don't change.
Yes, they do.
They do, Buck.
Maybe not you, but everybody else.
It's like you've been trapped
in some time capsule.
Why?
What are you afraid of?
Right now,
it's just you and me here.
It's like...
I'm OK.
<i>I know you.</i>
It was me and you.
And all this other stuff...
makes me feel...
dead.
<i>And I don't wanna feel dead.</i>
Thanks.
You want me to go away?
Well, then come home with me tonight.
Just one night.
<i>And then...</i>
I don't know.
You'll never hear from me again.
You know, I...
Um... I gotta go.
What's so funny?
Chuck and Buck, and suck and fuck
and chuckin', yuckin', muckin'...
Do you remember me?
Yeah, I remember you.
I remember everything.
Buck?
Turn that off.
I'm gonna go home now.
I don't want you to go.
We had a deal.
OK?
You've got to grow up.
Like you?
I'm trying, you know.
There's somebody else in my life now.
<i>Goodbye, Buck.</i>
<i>Hey, Buck.</i>
Buck... What's wrong?
There's no love for me.
Not anymore.
Yes, there is.
Yes, there is.
I like Coke.
I miss my Mom.
I'm afraid of a lot of things, you know?
I am, too.
You are?
Lots of things.
I'm a mess.
Hey.
Uh... I just wanted to come by and, uh...
say I'm sorry.
What, you wanna hump me or something?
No.
I'm just...
I'm just sorry.
Don't ever do that to me again, 'cause...
I don't wanna hump ya.
Yeah, OK.
You know what I think?
I think you gotta move in across the hall.
'Cause I don't wanna some bitch moving in
that's gonna get on my ass.
You know, I need
somebody in there like you.
Somebody who's gonna let me be me,
and let me do my shit, you know.
Is that really?
- Yeah, why not?
Well, I don't wanna some bitch
movin' in there.
<i>Good job, guys.</i>
Yes, that's very nice.
How are you guys doing?
- Nice.
<i>So where do you want this?</i>
Yeah, right there is OK.
I just wanna say, uh...
basically, um... thank you.
Thank you.
"Chitty Chitty, Bang Bang"...
was a hit.
And I think it's gonna go on and on
and on to thank you very, very much.
Well, I'm glad that the Board is happy
and that the theatre is doing fine.
And that the whole season is
all worked up now.
But I...
I'd like to see us try
something more meddier.
I mean, does it always have to be
children's theatre?
<i>No, of course not.</i>
<i>I mean, I'd... I'd like to get my
hands on... on an Ibsen or a Chekhov.</i>
<i>You know? I don't know,
something more intense.</i>
You know what I mean, Barry.
<i>I'll take the white wine
and your cake with chocolate.</i>
Well, let's see how you do with it. I mean, no,
just do your "Chitty Chitty, Bang Bang"...
Well, just keep it
in the back of your mind.
It's in the front of my mind!
For "Chitty Chitty, Bang Bang".
Hey, Jake.
- Hey, Buck.
Hey, guys.
- Hi!
OK, yeah. Hold on.
Buck, letter came for you.
Well, I'm sure that... that those
changes will make a difference.
OK, all right, all right, all right.
I'll talk to you later.
<i>Mr. Buck O'Brien</i>
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Charles T. Carlson

<i>at the marriage of their daughter
Carlyn Carlson to Charlie Sitter.</i>
<i>What is it?</i>
It's an invitation to a wedding.
<i>Oh! Who's been marrying?</i>
This guy I know.
<i>Look at you, what the fuck?</i>
Oh, I'm going on a wedding.
- Man, you look great.
Thanks.
I'm gonna be late.
All right. I want you to stop by later.
- OK, see you later.
All right. Hey,

Uh... OK.
- All right.
Do you, Charles, take Carlyn...
